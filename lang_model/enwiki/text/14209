The '''Siege of Szigetv<U+00E1>r''' or '''Battle of Szigeth''' ({{lang-hu|Szigetv<U+00E1>ri csata}}, {{lang-hr|Bitka kod Sigeta}} or {{lang|hr|''Sigetska bitka''}}, {{lang-tr|Zigetvar Sava<U+015F><U+0131>}}) was a siege of the [[Szigetv<U+00E1>r|Szigeth Fortress]] in [[Baranya (region)|Baranya]] (near the present Hungarian/Croatian border) which blocked [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman]]'s line of advance towards [[Vienna]] in 1566 AD.<ref name="Turnbull 56">Turnbull (2003), p. 56.</ref> The battle was fought between the defending forces of the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy]] under the leadership of [[Ban of Croatia|Croatian ban]] [[Nikola <U+0160>ubi<U+0107> Zrinski|Nicholas Zrinsky]] ({{lang-hr|Nikola <U+0160>ubi<U+0107> Zrinski}}, {{lang-hu|Zr<U+00ED>nyi Mikl<U+00F3>s}}), and the invading [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army under the nominal command of [[Sultan]] Suleiman the Magnificent ({{lang-ota|<U+0633><U+0644><U+064A><U+0645><U+0627><U+0646>}} ''S<U+00FC>leym<U+0101>n'').<ref name="Turnbull 56"/>

After the [[Battle of Moh<U+00E1>cs]] in 1526, which resulted in the end of the independent [[Kingdom of Hungary]], [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] was elected King by the nobles of both Hungary and [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatia]].<ref name="Corvisier and Childs289"/> This was followed by a series of conflicts with the Habsburgs and their allies, fighting against the Ottoman Empire. In the [[Little War in Hungary]] both sides exhausted themselves after sustaining heavy casualties. The Ottoman campaign in Hungary ceased until the offensive against Szigetv<U+00E1>r.<ref name="Turnbull, 49-51"/>

In January 1566 Suleiman went to war for the last time.<ref name="Turnbull, Stephen 1699"/> The siege of Szigetv<U+00E1>r was fought from 5 August to 8 September 1566 and, though it resulted in an Ottoman victory, there were heavy losses on both sides. Both commanders died during the battle<U+2014>Zrinsky in the final charge and Suleiman in his tent from natural causes.<ref name="Turnbull, 57"/><ref group="Note"> It is generally accepted that Suleiman died in his tent behind the siege lines from natural causes, before the Turks achieved victory. According to George F. Nafziger, Suleiman died of a heart attack when learned of his victory. According to Stephen Turnbull, several contemporary accounts, such as the ones used later by Nicholas VII Zrinsky for his epic, attribute Suleiman's death to Zrinsky's hand.</ref> More than 20,000 [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] had fallen during the attacks and almost all of Zrinsky's 2,300 man garrison was killed, with most of the final 600 men killed on the last day.<ref name="Lieber 345">Lieber (1845), p. 345.</ref> Although the battle was an Ottoman victory, it stopped the Ottoman push to Vienna that year.

The importance of the battle was considered so great that the [[France|French]] [[clergyman]] and [[statesman]] [[Cardinal Richelieu]] was reported to have described it as "the battle that saved civilization."<ref name="rarenewspapers"/> The battle is still famous in [[Croatia]] and [[Hungary]] and inspired both the Hungarian epic poem ''[[Siege of Sziget]]'' and the Croatian opera ''[[Nikola <U+0160>ubi<U+0107> Zrinski (opera)|Nikola <U+0160>ubi<U+0107> Zrinski]]''.<ref name="Cornis-Pope and Neubauer">Cornis-Pope and Neubauer (2004), pp. 518<U+2013>522.</ref>

==Background==
{{See also|Ottoman<U+2013>Habsburg wars}}
On 29 August 1526 the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] forces led by [[Louis II of Hungary|King Louis II]] were defeated at the [[Battle of Moh<U+00E1>cs]] by Ottoman forces led by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent.<ref name="Stephen Turnbull49">Turnbull (2003), p. 49</ref> Louis was killed in the battle which resulted in the end of the independent Kingdom of Hungary, as he died without an heir. Both Hungary and Croatia became disputed territories with claims from both the Habsburg and Ottoman empires. [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] from the [[Habsburg|House of Habsburg]], brother of [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]], married the sister of Louis II<ref name="Turnbull, 49-51">Turnbull (2003), pp. 49<U+2013>51.</ref> and was elected King by the nobles of both Hungary and Croatia.<ref name="Corvisier and Childs289">Corvisier and Childs (1994), p. 289</ref><ref name="Cetin">Milan Kruhek: Cetin, grad izbornog sabora Kraljevine Hrvatske 1527, Karlova<U+010D>ka <U+017D>upanija, 1997, Karlovac</ref><ref group="Note">On January 1, 1527, the Croatian nobles at [[Cetin Castle|Cetin]] unanimously elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria]] as their king, and confirmed the succession to him and his heirs. In return for the throne, Archduke Ferdinand, at [[Parliament on Cetin]] ({{lang-hr|Cetinski [[Sabor]]}}), promised to respect the historic rights, freedoms, laws, and customs the Croats had when united with the Hungarian kingdom and to defend Croatia from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasion. ([http://www.archive.org/stream/southernslavques00seto/southernslavques00seto_djvu.txt R. W. Seton -Watson:The southern Slav question and the Habsburg Monarchy page 18])</ref>

The throne of Hungary became the subject of a dynastic dispute between Ferdinand and [[John Z<U+00E1>polya]] from [[Principality of Transylvania|Transylvania]]. Suleiman had promised to make Z<U+00E1>polya the ruler of all Hungary.<ref name="Turnbull, 55-56">Turnbull (2003), pp. 55<U+2013>56.</ref> Ferdinand set out to [[Hungarian campaign of 1527<U+2013>1528|enforce his claim on Hungary]] and captured [[Buda]] from John Z<U+00E1>polya in 1527, only to relinquish his hold on it in 1529 when an Ottoman counter-attack stripped Ferdinand of all his territorial gains during 1527 and 1528.<ref name="Turnbull, 49-51"/> The [[Siege of Vienna]] in 1529 was the first attempt by Suleiman the Magnificent to capture the Austrian capital. This siege signalled the pinnacle of Ottoman power and the maximum extent of Ottoman expansion in central Europe.<ref name="Turnbull, 49-51"/>

===Little War in Hungary===
{{Main|Little War in Hungary}}
The years from 1529 to 1552 were known as the "Little War in Hungary". Following Suleiman's unsuccessful siege of Vienna in 1529 Ferdinand launched a counter-attack in 1530 to regain the initiative. An assault on Buda was driven off by [[John Z<U+00E1>polya]], although Ferdinand was successful elsewhere<U+2014>capturing [[Esztergom|Gran]] (Esztergom) and other forts along the Danube river, a vital strategic frontier.<ref name="Turnbull, 49-51"/>

[[File:Hungary 1550.png|thumb|left|Habsburg and Ottoman Hungary, a decade before the Battle of Szigetv<U+00E1>r]]
Suleiman's response came in 1532 when he led a massive army of over 120,000 troops to besiege Vienna again. Ferdinand withdrew his army, leaving only 700 men with no cannons and a few guns to defend [[Koszeg|G<U+00FC>ns]] (Koszeg)<ref name="Turnbull, 49-51"/> although [[Pargal<U+0131> <U+0130>brahim Pasha|Ibrahim Pasha]], the Grand Vizier of the Ottomans,  did not realize how poorly defended Koszeg was. Suleiman came to join him shortly after the siege had started.<ref name="Turnbull, 49-51"/> For more than twenty five days Croatian captain [[Nikola Juri<U+0161>i<U+0107>]] and his garrison of 800 [[Croats]] held out against nineteen full-scale assaults and an incessant bombardment by the Ottomans.<ref name="Wheatcroft 59-60"/> As a result the city was offered a surrender on favourable terms and, although the offer was rejected, the Ottomans retreated<ref name="Wheatcroft 59-60"/><ref name="<U+00C1>goston and Alan Masters583"><U+00C1>goston and Alan Masters (2009), p. 583</ref><ref group="Note"> According to Stephen Turnbull, the city was offered terms for a nominal surender. The only Ottomans who would be allowed to enter the castle would be a token force who would raise the Turkish flag. Anyway, Suleiman withdrew at the arrival of the August rains, and did not continue towards Vienna as previously planned, but homeward.</ref> leading to a peace treaty between Ferdinand and Suleiman. John Z<U+00E1>polya was recognized as the King of Hungary by the Habsburgs, although as an Ottoman [[vassal]].<ref name="Turnbull, 49-51"/>

The treaty did not satisfy either John Z<U+00E1>polya or Ferdinand and their armies began skirmishes along the borders. In 1537 Ferdinand attacked John<U+2019>s forces at [[Osijek]] in violation of the treaty. The siege was a disaster of similar magnitude to that of Moh<U+00E1>cs, with an Ottoman relief army smashing the Austrians. Rather than attack Vienna again Suleiman attacked [[Otranto]] in southern [[Italy]]. Nonetheless, an Ottoman victory at the naval [[Battle of Preveza (1538)]] gave the Habsburg-led coalition another defeat.<ref name="Turnbull, 52">Turnbull (2003), p. 52.</ref>

John Z<U+00E1>polya died in 1540 and was succeeded by his infant son [[John II Sigismund Z<U+00E1>polya]]. For much of his reign the country was governed by his mother [[Isabella Jagiellon]], with continued support from Suleiman. John II remained as nominal King of Hungary until he abdicated  in 1570 and returned the country to Habsburg rule.<ref name="Turnbull, 52"/>

A further humiliating defeat was inflicted on the Habsburgs in the [[Siege of Buda (1541)]] when the Ottomans responded to a request for help from Isabella Jagiellon. In April 1543 Suleiman launched another campaign in Hungary, taking back Bran and other forts so that much of Hungary returned to Ottoman control. In August 1543 the Ottomans succeeded in the [[Siege of Esztergom (1543)]] which was followed by the capture of three Hungarian cities: [[Sz<U+00E9>kesfeh<U+00E9>rv<U+00E1>r]], [[Sikl<U+00F3>s]] and [[Szeged]], offering better security for Buda.<ref name="Turnbull, 52"/>

Another peace agreement between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans lasted until 1552 when Suleiman decided to attack [[Eger]]. The [[Siege of Eger|siege]] proved futile and the Habsburg victory reversed a period of territorial losses in Hungary. The survival of Eger gave the Austrians good reason to believe that Hungary was still a contested ground and the Ottoman campaign in Hungary ceased, until its revival in 1566.<ref name="Turnbull, 52"/>

In January 1566 Sultan Suleiman I had ruled the Ottoman Empire for 46 years and went to war for the last time.<ref name="Turnbull, Stephen 1699">Turnbull (2003), p. 55.</ref> He was 72 years old and, although having gout to the extent that he was carried on a litter, he nominally commanded his thirteenth [[military campaign]].<ref name="Turnbull, Stephen 1699"/> On 1 May 1566 the Sultan left [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] at the head of one of the largest armies he had ever commanded.<ref name="Turnbull, Stephen 1699"/>

His opposite number, Count Nicholas Zrinsky, was one of the largest landholders in [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]], a seasoned veteran of border warfare, and a [[Ban of Croatia|Ban]] (Croation royal representative) from 1542 to 1556.<ref>Krokar Slide Set #27, image 42</ref> In his early life he distinguished himself in the [[Siege of Vienna]] and pursued a successful military career.<ref name="Shelton 82-83"/>

Suleiman's forces reached [[Belgrade]] on 27 June after a forty nine day march. Here he met with [[John II Sigismund Z<U+00E1>polya]] who he earlier promised to make the ruler of all Hungary.<ref name="Turnbull, 55-56"/> Learning of the Zrinsky's success in an attack upon a Turkish encampment at [[Sikl<U+00F3>s]], Suleiman decided to postpone his attack on [[Eger]] ({{lang-de|Erlau}}) and instead attack Zrinsky's fortress at Szigetv<U+00E1>r to eliminate him as a threat.<ref name="Setton 845-846">Setton (1991), pp. 845<U+2013>846.</ref><ref name="Shelton 82-83"/>

===Siege===
The advanced guard of the Turks arrived at on 2 August 1566 and the defenders made several successful sorties causing considerable loss to the Turks.<ref name="Copp<U+00E9>e 562-565"/> The Sultan arrived with the main force on 5 August<ref name="Copp<U+00E9>e 562-565">Copp<U+00E9>e (1864), pp. 562<U+2013>565.</ref><ref name="Turnbull 56"/> and his big war tent was erected on the Similehov hill, giving him a view of the battle. The Sultan had to stay in his camp where he received verbal battle progress reports from his [[Grand Vizier]] [[Sokollu Mehmet Pa<U+015F>a|Sokollu Mehmed Pasha]], the real operational commander of the Ottoman forces.<ref>Sakao<U+011F>lu (1999), pp. 140<U+2013>141.</ref>

Count Zrinsky found himself besieged by a hostile army of at least 150,000 soldiers with powerful artillery.<ref name="Copp<U+00E9>e 562-565"/> Zrinsky had assembled a force of around 2,300 [[Croats|Croatian]] and [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] soldiers prior to the siege.<ref name="Wheatcroft 59-60"/> These consisted of his personal forces and those of his friends and allies.<ref name="Perok 46-48">Perok (1861), pp. 46<U+2013>48.</ref> The majority of the defenders were Croatian, with a significant Hungarian contingent represented in both the [[men-at-arms]] and the leadership.<ref name="Perok 46-48"/><ref name="Wheatcroft 59-60"/>

Szigetv<U+00E1>r was divided into three sections divided by water: the old town, the new town and the castle<U+2014>each of which was linked to the next by bridges and to the land by [[causeway]]s.<ref name="Turnbull 56"/> Although it was not built on particularly high ground the inner castle, which occupied much of the area of today's castle, was not directly accessible to the attackers. This was because two other baileys had to be taken and secured before a final assault on the inner castle could be launched.<ref name="Turnbull 56"/>

When the Sultan appeared before the Fortress he saw the walls hung with red cloth, as though for a festive reception, and a single great cannon thundered once to greet the mighty warrior monarch.<ref name="Roworth 53">Roworth (1840), p. 53.</ref> The siege began on 6 August when Suleiman ordered a general assault on the ramparts,<ref name="Copp<U+00E9>e 562-565"/> although the attack was successfully repulsed.<ref name="Copp<U+00E9>e 562-565"/> Despite being undermanned, and greatly outnumbered, the defenders were sent no reinforcements from Vienna by the imperial army.<ref name="Copp<U+00E9>e 562-565"/>

After over a month of exhausting and bloody struggle the few remaining defenders retreated into the old town for their last stand. The Sultan tried to entice Zrinsky to surrender, ultimately offering him leadership of Croatia under Ottoman influence,<ref name="Roworth 53"/><ref name="Pardoe 84">Pardoe (1842), p. 84.</ref> Count Zrinsky did not reply and continued to fight.<ref name="Pardoe 84"/>

The fall of the castle appeared inevitable but the Ottoman high command hesitated. On 6 September the Suleiman died in his tent<ref name="Turnbull, 57"/> and his death was kept secret at great effort<ref name="Turnbull, 57"/> with only the Sultan's innermost circle knowing of his demise. A courier was dispatched from the camp with a message for  Suleiman's successor, [[Selim II|Selim]]. The courier may not even have known the content of the message he delivered to distant [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] within a mere eight days.<ref name="Turnbull, 57"/>

===Final battle===
[[Image:Oton Ivekovic, Nikola Subic Zrinski.jpg|thumb|right|Nicholas Subich Zrinsky, preparing for the final battle, by [[Oton Ivekovi<U+0107>]]]]
The final battle began on September the 7th, the day after Suleiman's demise. By this time, the fortress walls had been reduced to rubble by [[mining (military)|mining]] with explosives and wood fuleed fires at the corners of the walls. In the morning an all-out attack  began<ref name="Lieber 345"/> with fusillades from small arms, "[[Greek fire]]", and a concentrated cannonade.<ref group="Note">According to Robert William Fraser, more than 10,000 large cannon balls where shot into the fortress during the siege.</ref> Soon the castle, the last stronghold within Szigetv<U+00E1>r, was set ablaze and cinders fell into the apartments of the count.<ref name="Lieber 345"/>

The Ottoman army swarmed through the city, drumming and yelling. Zrinsky prepared for a last charge addressing his troops: {{cquote|...Let us go out from this burning place into the open and stand up to our enemies. Who dies&nbsp;<U+2013> he will be with God. Who dies not&nbsp;<U+2013> his name will be honoured. I will go first, and what I do, you do. And God is my witness&nbsp;<U+2013> I will never leave you, my brothers and knights!...}}

Zrinsky did not allow the final assault to break into the castle.<ref name="Shelton 82-83"/>  As the Turks were pressing forwards along a narrow bridge the defenders suddenly flung open the gate and fired a large mortar loaded with broken iron, killing 600 attackers.<ref name="Shelton 82-83"/> Zrinsky then ordered a charge and led his remaining 600 troops out of the castle.<ref name="Shelton 82-83"/> He received two musket wounds in his chest and was killed shortly afterwards by an arrow to the head.<ref name="Shelton 82-83"/> Some of his force retired into the castle.<ref name="Shelton 82-83"/>

The Turks took the castle and most of the defenders were slain. A few of the captured defenders were spared by [[Janissary|Janissaries]] who had admired their courage,<ref name="Shelton 82-83"/> with only seven defenders managing to escape through the Ottoman lines. Zrinsky's corpse was beheaded and his head taken to the Emperor<ref>Sakao<U+011F>lu (1999), p. 141.</ref> while his body received an honourable burial by a Turk who had been his prisoner, and well treated by him.<ref name="Shelton 82-83"/>

===Powder magazine explosion===
Before leading the final sortie by the castle garrison, Zrinsky ordered a fuse be lit to the powder magazine.<ref name="Lieber 345"/><ref group="Note">According to Francis Lieber, explosion of the powder magazine is somewhat disputable.</ref> After cutting down the last of the defenders the besiegers poured into the fortress. The Ottoman Army entered the remains of Szigetv<U+00E1>r and fell into the booby trap,<ref name="Turnbull, 57"/> thousands perished in the blast when the castle's magazine exploded.<ref>Dupuy (1970), p. 501.</ref>

The Vizier Ibrahim's life was saved by one of Zrinsky's household who warned him of the trap when the Vizier and his troops searched for treasure and interrogated the survivors. While inquiring about treasure the prisoner replied that it had been long expended, but that 3,000&nbsp;[[Pound-force|lbs]] of powder were under their feet to which a slow match had been attached.<ref name="Shelton 82-83"/> The Vizier and his mounted officers had just enough time to escape but 3,000 Turks perished in the explosion.<ref name="Wheatcroft 59-60"/><ref name="Shelton 82-83"/><ref name="Copp<U+00E9>e 562-565"/><ref name="Nafziger & Walton 105">Nafziger & Walton (2003), p. 105</ref>

Almost all of Zrinsky's garrison was wiped out after the final battle.<ref name="Lieber 345"/> Ottoman casualties were also heavy. Three [[pasha]]s, 7,000 [[Janissary|Janissaries]] and 28,000 other soldiers are said to have perished.<ref name="Shelton 82-83"/> Sources vary on the exact number with estimates ranging from 20,000<U+2013>35,000.<ref name="Lieber 345"/><ref name="Shelton 82-83"/><ref name="Tait 679"/>

After the battle the Grand Vizier forged bulletins in the Sultan's name, proclaiming victory.<ref name="Turnbull, 57"/> These announced that the Sultan regretted that his current state of health prevented him from continuing with the successful campaign.<ref name="Turnbull, 57"/> His body was returned to Constantinople while the inner circle of officials pretended to keep up communication with him.<ref name="Turnbull, 57"/> Turkish sources state that the illusion was maintained for three weeks and that even the Sultan's personal physician was strangled as a precaution.<ref name="Turnbull, 57"/>

The Croatian [[Renaissance]] poet and writer [[Brne Karnaruti<U+0107>]], from [[Zadar]], wrote ''The Conquest of the City of Sziget'' ({{lang-hr|Vazetje Sigeta grada}}) sometime before 1573.<ref name="Brne Karnaruti<U+0107>">Karnaruti<U+0107> (1866), pp. 1<U+2013>83.</ref> His work was posthumously published in 1584 in [[Venice]].<ref name="Brne Karnaruti<U+0107>"/> This is the first Croatian historical epic dealing with national history and the Battle of Szigetv<U+00E1>r. It was inspired by [[Marko Maruli<U+0107>|Maruli<U+0107>'s]] ''Judita''.<ref name="Brne Karnaruti<U+0107>"/><ref name="Istvan Lokos">{{cite journal | url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=14696 | title=Prilozi mad<U+017E>arskoj recepciji Maruli<U+0107>evih djela | trans_title=A Contribution to the Hungarian Reception of Maruli<U+0107><U+2019>s Works | first=Istv<U+00E1>n | last=L<U+00F6>k<U+00F6>s | journal=Colloquia Maruliana | volume=6 | date=April 1997 | language=Croatian | format=PDF | accessdate=2009-12-03}}</ref>

The battle was also immortalized in the Hungarian epic poem ''Szigeti Veszedelem'' ("''Peril of Sziget''"), written in fifteen parts by Zrinsky's great-grandson [[Mikl<U+00F3>s Zr<U+00ED>nyi|Nicholas VII of Zrin]] (also a Ban of Croatia) in 1647 and published in 1651.<ref name="Cornis-Pope and Neubauer"/> This was one of the first such epics in the Hungarian language and was also inspired by Maruli<U+0107>'s ''Judita''.<ref name="Brne Karnaruti<U+0107>"/><ref name="Istvan Lokos"/> [[Kenneth Clark]]'s renowned history ''Civilisation'' lists the ''Szigeti Veszedelem'' as one of the major literary achievements of the 17th century.<ref name="Cornis-Pope and Neubauer"/> In spite of the author and other members of Zrinsky family being fierce enemies of the Turks, the poem never demonizes them.<ref name="Anzulovic, 57">Anzulovic (2000), p. 57.</ref> The Turks are portrayed as human beings and a love story between Deliman the Tatar and the Sultan's daughter Cumilla is interwoven into the main plot.<ref name="Anzulovic, 57"/>

[[Petar Zrinski|Peter Zrinsky]] ({{lang-hr|Petar Zrinski}}, {{lang-hu|Zr<U+00ED>nyi P<U+00E9>ter}}), the brother of Nicholas VII of Zrin, published ''Opsida Sigecka'' (1647/8) in the Croatian language<U+2014>not surprising since the [[House of Zrinski|Zrinsky family]] were bilingual.<ref name="Cornis-Pope and Neubauer"/>

Another Croatian nobleman warrior-poet [[Pavao Ritter Vitezovi<U+0107>]] (1652<U+2013>1713) wrote about the battle.<ref name="Anzulovic, 57-58">Anzulovic (2000), pp. 57<U+2013>58.</ref> His poem ''Odiljenje sigetsko'' ("The Sziget Farewell"), first published in 1684, reminisces about the event without rancour or crying for revenge.<ref name="Anzulovic, 57-58"/> The last of the four cantos is titled "Tombstones" and consists of epitaphs for the Croatian and Turkish warriors who died during the siege, paying equal respect to both.<ref name="Anzulovic, 57-58"/>

[[Ivan Zajc]]'s 1876 opera ''[[Nikola <U+0160>ubi<U+0107> Zrinski (opera)|Nikola <U+0160>ubi<U+0107> Zrinski]]'' is his most famous and popular work in Croatia. This recounts the heroic defiance of the [[Croats]] towards the Turks, as a metaphor for their later nationalist impulses within the [[Habsburg monarchy]].<ref name="nytimes">{{cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/29/arts/opera-zajc-s-nikola-subic-zrinski.html | title=Opera: Zajc's 'Nikola Subic Zrinski' | last=Rockwell | first=John | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 29, 1986 | accessdate=2009-12-03}}</ref>

Zrinski is depicted in the plot  as a 16th-century Croatian hero who defeated the Turks a couple of times before perishing sacrificially, along with his family and close supporters, in the siege of Szigeth castle.<ref name="Cornis-Pope and Neubauer"/><ref name="nytimes"/> The opera is patriotic with a famous aria "[[U boj, u boj]]".<ref name="Cornis-Pope and Neubauer"/><ref name="nytimes"/>
