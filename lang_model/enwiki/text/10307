'''Pedro II''' ({{IPA-pt|<U+02C8>ped<U+027E>u}}; English: Peter II; 2 December 1825 &ndash; 5 December 1891), nicknamed "the [[Magnanimity|Magnanimous]]",<ref name="Bueno, p.196">[[#refBueno2003|Bueno (2003)]], p. 196.</ref><ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 85.</ref> was the [[List of Brazilian monarchs#Emperors of Brazil (1822<U+2013>1889) - post-Independence monarchs of the Brazilian Empire|second and last ruler]] of the [[Empire of Brazil]], reigning for over 58 years.{{ref label|specialnote_A|A|none}} His name in full was '''Pedro de Alc<U+00E2>ntara Jo<U+00E3>o Carlos Leopoldo Salvador Bibiano Francisco Xavier de Paula Leoc<U+00E1>dio Miguel Gabriel Rafael Gonzaga''' (English: Peter of Alcantara John Charles Leopold Saviour Vivian Francis Xavier of Paula Leocadio Michael Gabriel Raphael Gonzaga).<ref name="Bueno, p.196"/><ref name="Vainfas, p.198">[[#refVainfas2002|Vainfas (2002)]], p. 198.</ref><ref name="Calmon (1975), p.4">[[#refCalmon1975|Calmon (1975)]], p. 4.</ref><ref>[[#refSchwarcz1998|Schwarcz (1998)]], p. 45.</ref> Born in [[Rio de Janeiro]], he was the seventh child of Emperor Dom [[Pedro I of Brazil]] and [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria|Empress Maria Leopoldina]] and thus a member of the Brazilian branch of the [[House of Braganza]], and was referred to using the honorific "[[Dom (title)|Dom]]" from birth.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 424.</ref> His father's abrupt abdication and flight to Europe in 1831 left a 5-year-old Pedro as Emperor and led to a grim and lonely childhood and adolescence. Obliged to spend his time studying in preparation for rule, he knew only brief moments of happiness and encountered few friends of his age. His experiences with court intrigues and political disputes during this period greatly affected his later character. Pedro II grew into a man with a strong sense of duty and devotion toward his country and his people. On the other hand, he increasingly resented his role as monarch.

Inheriting an empire on the verge of disintegration, Pedro II turned [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-speaking [[Brazil]] into an emerging power in the international arena. The nation grew to be distinguished from its [[Hispanic America|Hispanic neighbors]] on account of its political stability, zealously-guarded freedom of speech, respect for civil rights, vibrant economic growth and especially for its form of government: a functional, [[Constitutional monarchy|representative parliamentary monarchy]]. Brazil was also victorious in three international conflicts (the [[Platine War]], the [[Uruguayan War]] and the [[War of the Triple Alliance]]) under his rule, as well as prevailing in several other international disputes and domestic tensions. Pedro steadfastly pushed through the abolition of slavery despite opposition from powerful political and economic interests. A savant in his own right, the Emperor established a reputation as a vigorous sponsor of learning, culture and the sciences. He won the respect and admiration of scholars such as [[Charles Darwin]], [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and was a friend to [[Richard Wagner]], [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], among others.

Although there was no desire for a change in the form of government among most [[Brazilian people|Brazilians]], the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'<U+00E9>tat that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of [[republic]] headed by a [[Dictatorship|dictator]]. Pedro II had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He allowed no prevention of his ouster and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy afterwards. He spent the last two years of his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.

The reign of Pedro II thus came to an unusual end<U+2014>he was overthrown while highly regarded by the people and at the pinnacle of his popularity, and most of his accomplishments were soon brought to naught as Brazil slipped into a long period of anarchy, dictatorship and economic crises. The same men who had exiled him soon began to see in him a model for the Brazilian republic. A few decades after his death, his reputation was restored and his remains were returned to Brazil as those of a national hero. This reputation has lasted to the present day. Historians have regarded the Emperor in an extremely positive light, and he is usually ranked as the greatest Brazilian ever.

Upon leaving the country, Emperor Pedro I selected three people to [[Minority reign|take charge]] of his son and remaining daughters.

The elevation of Pedro II to the Imperial throne in 1831 led to a period of crisis, the most troublesome in Brazil's history.<ref>[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (v.1, 1977)]], p. 21.</ref> A [[Regent|regency]] had been created to rule on his behalf until he reached the age of majority.<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.21"/> Disputes between political factions led to several rebellions and resulted in an unstable, almost anarchical, situation under the regents.<ref>[[#refSchwarcz1998|Schwarcz (1998)]], p. 53.</ref>

The possibility of lowering the young emperor's age of majority, instead of waiting until he turned 18 on 2 December 1843, had been floated since 1835.<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.37">[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], p. 37.</ref><ref name="Schwarcz, p.67">[[#refSchwarcz1998|Schwarcz (1998)]], p. 67.</ref><ref>[[#refOlivieri1999|Olivieri (1999)]], p. 11.</ref> The idea had received support from both main political parties.<ref name="Schwarcz, p.67"/><ref name="Lyra v.1, p.67">[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (v.1, 1977)]], p. 67.</ref> It was thought that those assisting him in taking the reins of government would be in a position to manipulate the inexperienced youth.<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.38">[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], p. 38.</ref> Those politicians who had risen to power during the 1830s had by now also become familiar with the pitfalls of rule. According to historian Roderick J. Barman, by 1840 "they had lost all faith in their ability to rule the country on their own. They accepted Pedro II as an authority figure whose presence was indispensable for the country's survival."<ref name="Barman1999, p.317">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 317.</ref> The Brazilian people also supported lowering the age of majority,<ref>[[#refBueno2003|Bueno (2003)]], pp. 194<U+2013>195.</ref> as they considered Pedro II "the living symbol of the unity of the fatherland"; this position "gave him, in the eyes of public opinion, a higher authority than that of any regent."<ref>[[#refOlivieri1999|Olivieri (1999)]], p. 10.</ref>

Those advocating the immediate elevation of Pedro II to majority passed a motion requesting the Emperor assume full powers.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.72">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 72.</ref> A delegation was sent to the Palace of S<U+00E3>o Crist<U+00F3>v<U+00E3>o to ask whether Pedro II would accept or reject an early declaration of his majority.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.72"/><ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.39">[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], p. 39.</ref><ref name="Schwarcz, p.68">[[#refSchwarcz1998|Schwarcz (1998)]], p. 68.</ref> He shyly answered "Yes" when asked if he desired the age of majority to be lowered, and "Now" when asked if he would prefer that it come into effect at that moment or would rather await his birthday in December.<ref>[[#refCalmon1975|Calmon (1975)]], p. 136.</ref><ref>[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (v.1, 1977)]], p. 70.</ref> On the following day, 23 July 1840, the ''Assembl<U+00E9>ia Geral'' (the National Assembly) formally declared the 14-year-old Pedro II of age.<ref name="Bueno, p.194">[[#refBueno2003|Bueno (2003)]], p. 194.</ref><ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.40">[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], p. 40.</ref> There, in the afternoon, the young emperor took the oath of office.<ref name="Olivieri, p.12">[[#refOlivieri1999|Olivieri (1999)]], p. 12.</ref><ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 73.</ref> He was acclaimed, crowned and consecrated on 18 July 1841.<ref>[[#refSchwarcz1998|Schwarcz (1998)]], p. 73.</ref><ref name="Lyra v.1, p.72">[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (v.1, 1977)]], p. 72.</ref>

Removal of the factious regency stabilized the government. With a legitimate monarch on the throne, authority was vested in a single, clear voice.<ref name="Barman1999 p.74">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 74.</ref> Pedro II perceived his role as that of an arbiter, keeping personal views from hindering his duty to untangle partisan political disputes.<ref name="Barman1999 p.74"/> The young Emperor was diligent in his new role, making daily personal inspections and visits to government branches. His subjects were impressed by his seeming self-confidence,<ref name="Barman1999 p.74"/> although his shyness and lack of social grace were considered flaws.

Behind the scenes, a group of high ranking palace servants and notable politicians became known as the "Courtier Faction" as they established influence over the young Emperor<U+2014>and some were very close indeed.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.49">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 49.</ref> Pedro II was deftly used by the courtiers to eliminate their foes (actual or suspected) by obtaining the dismissal of rivals. Access to his person by rival politicians and the flow of information he received were strictly controlled. A continuous round of meetings, study, personal appearances and government business, used as distractions, kept the Emperor occupied, effectively isolating and keeping him unaware of being exploited.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 80.</ref>

By 1846 Pedro II had matured physically and mentally. He was no longer an insecure 14-year-old swayed by gossip, suggestions of secret plots, and other manipulative tactics.<ref name="Barman1999, p.109">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 109.</ref> He grew into a man who, at {{m to ft in|1.90}} tall<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.9"/><ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 81.</ref> with blue eyes and blond hair,<ref name="Schwarcz, p.68"/><ref name="Barman 1999, p.97"/><ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.9">[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], p. 9.</ref> was described as handsome.<ref name="Lyra v.1, p.50"/><ref name="Barman 1999, p.97"/><ref>[[#refCalmon1975|Calmon (1975)]], p. 187.</ref> With growth, his weaknesses faded and his strengths of character came to the fore. He learned to be not only impartial and diligent, but also courteous, patient and personable. As he began to fully exercise authority, his new social skills and diligence in government contributed greatly to his effectiveness and public image.<ref name="Barman1999, p.109"/> Historian Roderick J. Barman describes him at this time: "He kept his emotions under iron discipline. He was never rude and never lost his temper. He was exceptionally discreet in words and cautious in action."<ref name="Barman1999, p.122">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 122.</ref>

The end of 1845 through the beginning of 1846 found the Emperor making a tour of Brazil's southern provinces, traveling through [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] (of which [[Paran<U+00E1> (state)|Paran<U+00E1>]] was a part at this time) and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. He was buoyed by the warm and enthusiastic responses he received.<ref name="Barman1999 p.111">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 111.</ref> This success encouraged him, for the first time in his life, to act confidently on his own initiative and insights.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], pp. 111<U+2013>112.</ref> Most importantly, this period saw the end of the Courtier Faction.

Pedro II was faced by three crises between 1848 and 1852.<ref name="Barman1999, p.122"/> The first test came in confronting the trade in illegally imported slaves. This had been banned in 1826 as part of a treaty with Britain.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 123.</ref> Trafficking continued unabated, however, and the British government's passage of the [[Aberdeen Act]] of 1845 authorized British warships to board Brazilian shipping and seize any found involved in the slave trade.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], pp. 122<U+2013>123.</ref> While Brazil grappled with this problem, the [[Praieira revolt]] erupted on 6 November 1848. This was a conflict between local political factions within [[Pernambuco]] province, and was suppressed by March 1849. A bill was [[Promulgation|promulgated]] on 4 September 1850 which gave government broad authority to combat the illegal slave trade. With this new tool, Brazil moved to eliminate importation of slaves. By 1852 this first crisis was over, with Britain accepting that the trade had been suppressed.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 124.</ref>

The third crisis entailed a conflict with the [[Argentine Confederation]] regarding ascendancy over territories adjacent to the [[R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]] and free navigation of that waterway.<ref name="Barman1999 p.125">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 125.</ref> Since the 1830s, Argentine dictator Don [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] had supported rebellions within [[Uruguay]] and Brazil. It was only in 1850 that Brazil was able to address the threat posed by Rosas.<ref name="Barman1999 p.125"/> An alliance was forged between Brazil, Uruguay and disaffected Argentines,<ref name="Barman1999 p.125"/> leading to the [[Platine War]] and the subsequent overthrow of the Argentine ruler in February 1852.<ref name="Barman1999, p.126">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 126.</ref><ref>[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], pp. 102<U+2013>103.</ref> In the words of historian Roderick J. Barman, a "considerable portion of the credit must be [...] assigned to the emperor, whose cool head, tenacity of purpose, and sense of what was feasible proved indispensable."<ref name="Barman1999, p.122"/>

The Empire's successful navigation of these crises considerably enhanced the nation's stability and prestige, and Brazil emerged as a hemispheric power.<ref>[[#refLevine1999|Levine (1999)]], pp. 63<U+2013>64.</ref> Internationally, Europeans began to regard the country as embodying familiar liberal ideals, such as freedom of the press and constitutional respect for civil liberties.

===Pedro II and politics===
[[File:Pedro II of Brazil 1853.jpg|thumb|220px|left|alt=Photographic half-length portrait of a seated bearded man dressed in a dark, double-breasted coat with his right hand tucked inside the front|Pedro II, around age 25, c.&nbsp;1851]]
At the beginning of the 1850s, Brazil was enjoying internal stability and economic prosperity.<ref name="Barman1999 p.159">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 159.</ref><ref>[[#refSchwarcz1998|Schwarcz (1998)]], p. 100.</ref> The nation was being interconnected through [[railroad]], electric [[telegraph]] and [[steamship]] lines, uniting it into a single entity.<ref name="Barman1999 p.159"/> The general opinion, both at home and abroad, was that these accomplishments had been possible for two reasons: "its governance as a [[monarchy]] and the character of Pedro II".<ref name="Barman1999 p.159"/>

Pedro II was neither a British-style [[figurehead]] nor an autocrat in the manner of [[List of Russian rulers|Russian czars]]. The Emperor exercised power through cooperation with elected politicians, economic interests, and popular support.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], pp. 161<U+2013>162.</ref> This interdependence and interaction did much to influence the direction of Pedro II's reign.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 162.</ref> The Emperor's more notable political successes were achieved due largely to the non-confrontational and cooperative manner with which he approached both issues and the partisan figures with whom he had to deal. He was remarkably tolerant, seldom taking offense at criticism, opposition, or even incompetence.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 164.</ref> He was diligent in appointing only highly-qualified candidates to positions in the government, and sought to curb corruption.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 163.</ref> He did not have the constitutional authority to force acceptance of his initiatives without support, and his collaborative approach towards governing kept the nation progressing and enabled the political system to successfully function.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 165.</ref>

The uncertainty of his childhood and exploitation at the hands of others during his youth made the Emperor determined to maintain control over his own destiny. Achieving self-determination required that sufficient power be acquired and maintained.<ref name="Barman1999 p.167">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 167.</ref> He used his active and essential participation in directing the course of government as a means of influence. His direction became indispensable, although it never devolved into "one-man rule."<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 178.</ref> The Emperor respected the prerogatives of the legislature, even when they resisted, delayed, or thwarted his goals and appointments.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], pp. 178<U+2013>179.</ref>

The Brazilian national political system resembled those in other [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] nations. The Emperor, as [[head of state]], would ask the leader of either the [[Conservative Party (Brazil)|Conservative]] or Liberal Party to form a cabinet. The other party formed the opposition in the legislature, a counterweight and check on the party in power. If support for the party in power diminished greatly, or if the cabinet resigned, the Emperor could call on others from either party to form a new government. "In his handling of the two parties, he needed to maintain a reputation for impartiality, work in accord with the popular mood, and avoid any flagrant imposition of his will on the political scene."<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 120.</ref> 

The active presence of Pedro II on the political scene was an important part of the government's structure, which also included the cabinet, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Senate of Brazil|Senate]] (the latter two formed the National Assembly, or Parliament). Most politicians appreciated and supported the Emperor's role. Many had lived through the regency period, when the lack of an emperor who could stand above petty and special interests led to years of strife between political factions. Their experiences in public life had created a conviction that the Emperor was "indispensable to Brazil's continued peace and prosperity."<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 170.</ref>

===Domestic life===

The marriage between Pedro II and Teresa Cristina started off badly. With maturity, patience, and their first child, [[Afonso, Prince Imperial of Brazil|Afonso]], their relationship improved.<ref name="Barman1999, p.126"/><ref>[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], p. 73.</ref> Later Teresa gave birth to more children: [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil|Isabel]], in 1846; [[Princess Leopoldina of Brazil|Leopoldina]], in 1847; and lastly, Pedro, in 1848.<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.52"/><ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 127.</ref><ref name="Vainfas2002 p.200">[[#refVainfas2002|Vainfas (2002)]], p. 200.</ref><ref>[[#refSchwarcz1998|Schwarcz (1998)]], p. 98.</ref> However, both boys died when very young, which devastated the Emperor.<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.52"/><ref name="Vainfas2002 p.200"/><ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 129.</ref> Beyond suffering as a father, his view of the Empire's future changed completely. Despite his affection for his daughters, he did not believe that Princess Isabel, although his heir, would have any chance of prospering on the throne. He felt his successor needed to be male for the monarchy to be viable.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], pp. 129<U+2013>130.</ref> He increasingly saw the Imperial system as being tied so inextricably to himself, that it would not survive him.<ref name="Barman1999 p.130">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 130.</ref> Isabel and her sister received exceptional educations,<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 151.</ref> although they were given no preparation for governing the nation. Pedro II excluded Isabel from participation in government business and decisions.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 152.</ref>

Sometime around 1850, Pedro II began having discreet affairs with other women.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 128.</ref> The most famous and enduring of these relationships involved [[Lu<U+00ED>sa de Barros, Countess of Barral|Lu<U+00ED>sa Margarida Portugal de Barros, Countess of Barral]], with whom he formed a romantic and intimate, though not adulterous, friendship after she was appointed governess to the emperor's daughters in November 1856.<ref name="Vainfas2002 p.200"/><ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], pp. 147<U+2013>148.</ref><ref>[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], p. 65.</ref> Throughout his life, the Emperor held onto a hope of finding a soulmate, something he felt cheated of<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 148.</ref> due to the necessity of a [[marriage of state]] to a woman for whom he never felt passion.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 144.</ref> This is but one instance illustrating the Emperor's dual identity: who on one hand was "Dom Pedro II" who assiduously carried out his duty in the role of Emperor which destiny had assigned to him, and who on the other hand was "Pedro de Alc<U+00E2>ntara" who considered the Imperial office an unrewarding burden and who was happier in the worlds of literature and science.<ref name="Carvalho2007 p.80">[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], p. 80.</ref> Pedro II was what would today be termed a [[workaholic]], and his routine was demanding. He usually woke up at 7&nbsp;am and did not sleep before 2 in the morning. His entire day was devoted to the affairs of state and the meager free time available was spent reading and studying.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 134.</ref> The Emperor went about his daily routine dressed in a simple black tail coat, trousers, and cravat. For special occasions he would wear court dress, and he only appeared in full regalia with crown, mantle and scepter twice each year at the opening and closing of the National Assembly.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], pp. 133<U+2013>134.</ref><ref>[[#refLyrav2|Lyra (v.2, 1977)]], pp. 54<U+2013>55.</ref> 

Pedro II held politicians and government officials to the strict standards which he exemplified.<ref name="Skidmore 2003 p. 73"/> The Emperor demanded politicians work at least an eight hour day and adopted a strict policy for the selection of civil servants based on morality and merit.<ref>[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], p. 83.</ref> To set the standard, he lived simply.

At the end of 1859, Pedro II departed on a trip to provinces north of the capital, visiting [[Esp<U+00ED>rito Santo]], [[Bahia]], [[Sergipe]], [[Alagoas]], [[Pernambuco]] and [[Para<U+00ED>ba]]. He returned in February 1860 after four months. The trip was a huge success, with the Emperor welcomed everywhere with warmth and joy.<ref>[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (v.1, 1977)]], pp. 200<U+2013>207.</ref><ref>[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], pp. 138<U+2013>141.</ref><ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 188.</ref>

The first half of the 1860s saw peace and prosperity in Brazil. [[Civil liberty|Civil liberties]] were maintained.<ref>[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (v.1, 1977)]], p. 200.</ref><ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 192.</ref> [[Freedom of speech]] had existed since Brazil's independence<ref>[[#refBesouchet1993|Besouchet (1993)]], p. 515.</ref> and continued to be strongly defended by Pedro II.<ref>[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], p. 84.</ref><ref name="Besouchet, p.508">[[#refBesouchet1993|Besouchet (1993)]], p. 508.</ref> The Emperor found newspapers from the capital and from the provinces an ideal way to keep track of public opinion and the nation's overall situation.<ref name="Carvalho2007 p.79"/> Another means of monitoring the Empire was through direct contacts with his subjects. One opportunity for this was during regular Tuesday and Saturday public audiences, where anyone of any social class (including slaves<ref name="Olivieri1999 p.27">[[#refOlivieri1999|Olivieri (1999)]], p. 27.</ref>) could gain admittance and present their petitions and stories.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 180.</ref><ref>[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], p. 94.</ref> Visits to schools, colleges, prisons, exhibitions, factories, barracks, and other public appearances presented further opportunities to gather first-hand information.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 184.</ref> 

This tranquility disappeared when the British consul in Rio de Janeiro, William Dougal Christie, nearly sparked a war between his nation and Brazil. Christie, who believed in [[Gunboat diplomacy]],<ref name="Calmon1975 p.678">[[#refCalmon1975|Calmon (1975)]], p. 678.</ref> sent an [[ultimatum]] containing abusive demands arising out of two minor incidents at the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862.

As war with the British Empire threatened, Brazil had to turn its attention to its southern frontiers.

Meanwhile, in December 1864 the dictator of Paraguay, [[Francisco Solano L<U+00F3>pez (politician)|Francisco Solano L<U+00F3>pez]] took advantage of the situation to establish his country as a regional power. The [[Paraguayan army]] invaded the Brazilian province of [[Mato Grosso]] (currently the state of [[Mato Grosso do Sul]]), triggering the [[War of the Triple Alliance]]. Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded [[Argentina|Argentine]] territory as a prelude to an attack upon the Brazilian province of [[Rio Grande do Sul]].<ref name="Carvalho2007 p.109"/><ref>[[#refSchwarcz1998|Schwarcz (1998)]], p. 299.</ref><ref name="Lyra v.1, p.227">[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (v.1, 1977)]], p. 227.</ref>

The diplomatic victory over the British Empire and the military victory over Uruguay in 1865, followed by a successful conclusion of the war with Paraguay in 1870, ushered in what is considered the "[[golden age]]" and apogee of the Brazilian Empire.<ref name="Lyra v.2, p.9">[[#refLyrav2|Lyra (v.2, 1977)]], p. 9.</ref> The 1870s were good times in Brazil, and the Emperor's popularity was greater than ever.

In 1870, few Brazilians opposed slavery and even fewer took an open stand against it.

On 25 May 1871 Pedro II and his wife traveled to Europe.<ref name="Barman1999 p.236">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 236.</ref><ref>[[#refLyrav2|Lyra (v.2, 1977)]], p. 175.</ref> He had long desired to vacation abroad.

The two had not seen each other in forty years, and the meeting was emotional. Pedro II remarked in his journal: "I cried from happiness and also from sorrow seeing my Mother so affectionate toward me but so aged and so sick."<ref name="Barman1999 p.236"/><ref>[[#refLyrav2|Lyra (v.2, 1977)]], p. 180.</ref><ref name="Carvalho2007 p.147">[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], p. 147.</ref> 

The Emperor proceeded to visit Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Italy, Egypt, Greece, Switzerland and France. In [[Coburg]] he visited his daughter's tomb.<ref name="Carvalho2007 p.147"/><ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], pp. 237<U+2013>238.</ref> He found this to be "a time of release and freedom".

The prestige of both Brazil and Pedro II were further enhanced during the tour when news came from Brazil that the Law of Free Birth, abolishing the last source of enslavement, had been ratified. The Imperial party returned to Brazil in triumph on 31 March 1872.<ref name="Barman1999, p.240"/>

===Quarrel with bishops===

Soon after returning to Brazil, Pedro II was faced with an unexpected crisis. The clergy had long been understaffed, undisciplined and poorly educated,<ref name="Barman1999, pp. 257<U+2013>258.">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 254.</ref><ref name="Carvalho2007, p.151">[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], p. 151.</ref> leading to a great loss of respect for the Catholic Church.<ref name="Barman1999, pp. 257<U+2013>258."/> The Imperial government had embarked upon a program of reform to address these deficiencies.<ref name="Barman1999, pp. 257<U+2013>258."/> As the Catholic Church was the state religion, the Emperor exercised a great deal of control over Church affairs,<ref name="Barman1999, pp. 257<U+2013>258."/> paying clerical salaries, appointing parish priests, nominating bishops, ratifying papal bulls, and overseeing seminaries.<ref name="Barman1999, pp. 257<U+2013>258."/><ref>[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], p. 150.</ref> In pursuing reform, the government selected bishops which satisfied its criteria for education, support for reform and moral fitness.<ref name="Barman1999, pp. 257<U+2013>258."/><ref name="Carvalho2007, p.151"/> However, as more capable men began to fill the clerical ranks, resentment of government control over the Church increased.<ref name="Barman1999, pp. 257<U+2013>258."/><ref name="Carvalho2007, p.151"/>

The bishops of [[Olinda]] and [[Par<U+00E1>]] were two of the new generation of educated, zealous Brazilian clerics. They had been influenced by the [[Ultramontanism]] which spread in Catholicism in this period. In 1872 they ordered [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] expelled from [[lay brother]]hoods.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], pp. 255<U+2013>256.</ref><ref name="Carvalho2007, p.153">[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], p. 153.</ref><ref>[[#refLyrav2|Lyra (v.2, 1977)]], pp. 205<U+2013>206.</ref> Although European Masonry often tended towards [[atheism]] and [[anti-clericalism]], things were much different in Brazil<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 255.</ref> where membership in Masonic orders was common.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 256.</ref> The government tried on two separate occasions to persuade the bishops to repeal, but they refused.

Pedro II was a conscientious adherent of Catholicism, which he viewed as advancing important civilizing and civic values. While meticulously orthodox in matters of doctrine, he felt free to think and behave independently.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 253.</ref> The Emperor accepted new ideas, such as [[Charles Darwin]]'s Theory of [[Evolution]], of which he remarked that "the laws that he [Darwin] has discovered glorify the [[God in Christianity|Creator]]".<ref>[[#refBesouchet1993|Besouchet (1993)]], p. 34.</ref> He was moderate in his religious beliefs,<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 92.</ref> but could not accept disrespect to civil law and government authority.<ref name="Carvalho2007, p.153"/><ref>[[#refLyrav2|Lyra (v.2, 1977)]], p. 213.</ref> As he told his son-in-law: "[The government] has to ensure that the constitution is obeyed.

Pedro II's trips abroad made a deep psychological impact.

===Decadence===

During the 1880s, Brazil continued to prosper and social diversity increased markedly, including the first organized push for [[women's rights]].<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 319.</ref> On the other hand, letters written by Pedro II reveal a man grown world-weary with age and having an increasingly alienated and pessimistic outlook.<ref name="Barman1999 p.298">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 298.</ref><ref name="Barman1999 p.299">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 299.</ref> He remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing the tasks demanded of the Imperial office, albeit often without enthusiasm.<ref name="Barman1999 p.299"/> Because of his increasing "indifference towards the fate of the regime"<ref name="Lyra v.3, p.126">[[#refLyrav3|Lyra (v.3, 1977)]], p. 126.</ref> and his lack of action in support of the Imperial system once it was challenged, historians have attributed the "prime, perhaps sole, responsibility" for the dissolution of the monarchy to the Emperor himself.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 399.</ref>

After their experience of the perils and obstacles of government, the political figures who had arisen during the 1830s looked to the Emperor as providing a fundamental source of authority essential both for governing and for national survival.<ref name="Barman1999, p.317"/> These elder statesmen began to die off or retire from government until, by the 1880s, they had almost entirely been replaced by a younger generation of politicians who had no experience of [[Early life of Pedro II of Brazil#The Regency|the Regency and early years]] of Pedro II's reign, when external and internal dangers threatened the nation's existence. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity.<ref name="Barman1999, p.317"/> In sharp contrast those of the previous era, the young politicians saw no reason to uphold and defend the Imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 318.</ref> Pedro II's role in achieving an era of national unity, stability and good government now went unremembered and unconsidered by the ruling elites. By his very success, the emperor had made his position seem unnecessary.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. xiv.</ref>

The lack of an heir who could feasibly provide a new direction for the nation also diminished the long-term prospects for continuation of the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor loved his daughter Isabel, but he considered the idea of a female successor as antithetical to the role required of Brazil's ruler. He viewed the death of his two sons as being a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted.<ref name="Barman1999 p.262">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 262.</ref> Resistance to accepting a female ruler was also shared by the political establishment.<ref name="Barman1999 p.268">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 268.</ref> Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still very traditional, and only a male successor was thought capable as head of state.<ref name="Barman1999 p.130"/>

Republicanism was an elitist creed which never flourished in Brazil,<ref name="Barman1999 p.348">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 349.</ref><ref name="Lyra v.3, p.121">[[#refLyrav3|Lyra (v.3, 1977)]], p. 121.</ref> with little support in the provinces.<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.206">[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], p. 206.</ref><ref name="Munro, p.279">[[#refMunro1942|Munro (1942)]], p. 279.</ref><ref name="Ermakoff2006 p.189">[[#refErmakoff2006|Ermakoff (2006)]], p. 189.</ref> But a serious threat to the monarchy was the combination of republican ideas with the dissemination of [[Positivism]] among the army's lower and medium officer ranks, which led to indiscipline among the corps.

[[Image:Petropolis-Cathedral4.jpg|thumb|right|220px|alt=Inside a gothic chapel, a marble effigy of a bearded emperor in uniform lies atop an intricately carved stone sarcophagus|Tomb of Pedro II and Teresa Cristina within the Cathedral of Petr<U+00F3>polis]]
After his fall, Brazilians remained attached to the popular Emperor whom they regarded as a hero<ref name="Schwarcz, p.497">[[#refSchwarcz1998|Schwarcz (1998)]], p. 497.</ref> and continued to perceive him as a national symbol, the Father of the People personified.<ref>[[#refMartins2008|Martins (2008)]], p. 66.</ref> This view was even stronger among those [[Afro-Brazilian|of African descent]], who equated the monarchy with freedom.<ref>[[#refSchwarcz1998|Schwarcz (1998)]], p. 469.</ref> The phenomenon of continued support for the deposed monarch is largely credited to a generally held and unextinguished belief that he was a truly "wise, benevolent, austere and honest ruler."<ref name="Salles 1996, p.15">[[#refSalles1996|Salles (1996)]], p. 15.</ref> The positive view towards Pedro II, and nostalgia for his reign, only grew as the nation quickly fell into a series of economic and political crises which Brazilians attributed to the Emperor's overthrow.<ref>[[#refSchwarcz1998|Schwarcz (1998)]], p. 496.</ref> He never ceased being a popular hero, and would gradually become, once again, an official hero.<ref name="Schwarcz, p.498">[[#refSchwarcz1998|Schwarcz (1998)]], p. 498.</ref>

Surprisingly strong feelings of guilt were manifested among republicans, and these became increasingly evident upon the Emperor's death in exile at the end of 1891.<ref>[[#refSchwarcz1998|Schwarcz (1998)]], pp. 495<U+2013>496.</ref> They praised Pedro II, who was seen as a model of [[Res publica|republican ideals]],<ref name="Schwarcz, p.508">[[#refSchwarcz1998|Schwarcz (1998)]], p. 508.</ref> and the imperial era, which they believed should be regarded as an example to be followed by the young republic.<ref>[[#refMartins2008|Martins (2008)]], p. 123.</ref> In Brazil, the news of the Emperor's death "aroused a genuine sense of regret among those who, without sympathy for a restoration, acknowledged both the merits and the achievements of their deceased ruler."<ref name="Schwarcz, p.497"/><ref name="Salles 1996, p.15"/><ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 402.</ref><ref>[[#refMartins2008|Martins (2008)]], pp. 122<U+2013>123.</ref>

His remains, as well of his wife, were finally returned to Brazil in 1920 and the government granted Pedro II dignities befitting a Head of State.<ref name="Calmon (1975), p.1914">[[#refCalmon1975|Calmon (1975)]], p. 1914.</ref> A national holiday was declared and the return of the Emperor as a national hero<ref>[[#refSchwarcz1998|Schwarcz (1998)]], p. 503.</ref> was celebrated throughout the country.<ref name="Schwarcz, p.508"/> Thousands attended the main ceremony in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Pedro Calmon describes the scene: "elderly people cried. Many knelt down. All clapped hands. There was no distinction between republicans and monarchists. They were all Brazilians."<ref name="Calmon (1975), p.1915">[[#refCalmon1975|Calmon (1975)]], p. 1915.</ref> This homage marked the reconciliation of Republican Brazil with its monarchical past.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 405.</ref>

Historians have expressed high regard for Pedro II and his reign. The scholarly literature dealing with him is vast and, with the exception of the period immediately after his ouster, overwhelmingly positive, and even laudatory.<ref>[[#refSchwarcz1998|Schwarcz (1998)]], p. 22.</ref> Emperor Pedro II is usually regarded by historians in Brazil as the greatest Brazilian.<ref name="Bueno, p.196"/><ref name="Vianna1994 p.467">[[#refVianna1994|Vianna1994 (1994)]], p. 467.</ref><ref name="Benevides1979 p.61">[[#refBenevides1979|Benevides (1979)]], p. 61.</ref> In a manner quite similar to methods which had been used by republicans, historians point to the Emperor's virtues as an example to be followed, although none go so far as to advocate a restoration of the monarchy. Richard Graham notes: "Most twentieth-century historians, moreover, have looked back on the period [of Pedro II's reign] nostalgically, using their descriptions of the Empire to criticize<U+2014>sometimes subtly, sometimes not<U+2014>Brazil's subsequent republican or dictatorial regimes."<ref>[[#refGraham1994|Graham (1994)]], p. 4.</ref>
