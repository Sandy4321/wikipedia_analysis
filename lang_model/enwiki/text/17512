The '''''Milwaukee''-class monitors''' were a [[ship class|class]] of four riverine [[ironclad]] [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]] built during the [[American Civil War]]. Several supported Union forces along the [[Mississippi River]] in mid-1864 before participating in the [[Battle of Mobile Bay]] in August. ''Chickasaw'' and ''Winnebago'' bombarded [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] coastal fortifications during the battle and during subsequent operations as well as engaging the ironclad [[CSS Tennessee (1863)|''Tennessee II'']]. The other two ships arrived at Mobile Bay after the battle and all four supported the [[Battle of Spanish Fort|land attacks on Mobile]] in March<U+2013>April 1865. ''Milwaukee'' struck a [[naval mine|torpedo]] during this time and sank. The surviving three ships were sold in 1874; ''Chickasaw'' was converted into a [[ferry]] and survived until 1944 when she was [[scuttled]]. Her wreck was discovered in 2004.

==Design and description==
These ships had their origin in an order from [[Gideon Welles]], [[Secretary of the Navy]], to [[Commodore (United States)]] [[Joseph Smith (1790<U+2013>1877)|Joseph Smith]], Chief of the [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] on 16 April 1863 to recommend four more river ironclads that could mount four {{convert|11|in|adj=on|0}} [[Dahlgren gun]]s on a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] no more than {{convert|6|ft|m|1}}. [[James Buchanan Eads|James Eads]] received the contract to build four iron-hulled, twin-[[gun turret|turreted]] ironclads, partly due to the influence of Missouri [[Congressman]] [[Frank P. Blair, Jr.]] Eads retained two of the ships, but subcontracted the other two to other builders.<ref>Canney, pp. 114, 150</ref> 

The ''Milwaukee''-class ships were {{convert|229|ft|m|1}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|56|ft|m}}.<ref name=s9/> They had a [[Glossary of nautical terms#D|depth of hold]] of {{convert|8|ft|6|in|m|1}}<ref name=c4>Canney, p. 114</ref> and a draft of six feet. The ships were 970 [[Builder's Old Measurement|tons burthen]]<ref name=s9/> and [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|1300|LT|t}}.<ref name=ck2>Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 123</ref>

They were powered by two 2-cylinder horizontal [[Marine steam engine|non-condensing steam engines]],<ref name=ck2/> each driving two  {{convert|7|ft|6|in|m|1|adj=on}} propellers,<ref name=c4/> using steam generated by seven tubular [[boiler (steam generator)|boilers]].<ref name=ck2/> The engines were designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|9|kn|lk=in}}. They had a [[bore (engine)|bore]] of {{convert|26|in|mm|0}} and a [[stroke (engine)|stroke]] of {{convert|24|in|mm|0}}.<ref name=c5>Canney, p. 115</ref> They carried {{convert|156|LT|t}} of coal.<ref name=ck2/>

The ships' main armament consisted of four [[smoothbore]], [[muzzle-loading]] 11-inch Dahlgren guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets.<ref name=s9/> The fore turret in each ship, except {{USS|Chickasaw|1864|2}}, was designed by Eads while the aft turret was the standard Ericsson design used in most Union monitors. Unlike the latter, which rested its entire weight on a central spindle that had to be elevated in order for the turret to rotate, Eads' design better distributed its weight because it rested on a number of ball bearings underneath the outer edge of the turret. The structure of the Eads turret extended down to be bottom of the ship and the entire structure rotated. The guns in the Eads turret were mounted on a steam-powered platform that moved up and down, so that the guns could be reloaded below deck, safe from enemy interference.
Both turrets used steam engines to rotate, but the Eads design also used it to to power virtually every function in the turret, including running out the guns, absorbing the recoil from firing, and opening the [[Glossary of nautical terms#G|gun ports]] to allow the guns to fire. The ability to adjust the level of the turret floor doubled the elevation of the guns to +20<U+00B0> compared to the +10<U+00B0> allowed in an Ericsson turret. Another advantage was that the Eads turret only required a crew of six men, far fewer than the Ericsson design.<ref name=c46>Canney, pp. 114<U+2013>16</ref> Each gun weighed approximately {{convert|16000|lb}}. They could fire a {{convert|136|lb|1|adj=on}} shell up to a range of {{convert|3650|yd}} at an elevation of +15<U+00B0>.<ref>Olmsted, et al, p. 90</ref>

The cylindrical turrets were protected by eight layers of [[wrought iron]] {{convert|1|in|adj=on}} plates above the [[deck (ship)|deck]]. Below the deck the turret side was only a single layer thick and had holes through which the guns were loaded. The sides of the hull consisted of three layers of one-inch plates, backed by {{convert|15|in}} of pine. The deck was heavily [[Camber (ship)|cambered]] to allow headroom for the crew on such a shallow draft and it consisted of iron plates {{convert|.75|in}} thick. {{USS|Milwaukee|1864|2}} and {{USS|Winnebago|1863|2}} had an additional layer of armor to give them a total of {{convert|1.5|in}}. The [[pilothouse]], positioned behind and above the fore turret, was protected by {{convert|3|in}} of armor.<ref name=c46/>

==Careers==
''Chickasaw'' and ''Winnebago'', the first two ship to be commissioned, spent some time patrolling the Mississippi River and supporting Union forces operating along its length before they were transferred to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron in early July 1864 to support the impending attack on the defenses of [[Mobile, Alabama]]<ref name=chi>{{cite DANFS | title = Chickasaw | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c8/chickasaw-i.htm | accessdate =1 January 2013 }}</ref><ref name=win>{{cite DANFS | title = Winnebago | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/w10/winnebago-i.htm | accessdate =1 January 2013 }}</ref> Rear Admiral [[David Farragut]] organized the four monitors present into a separate column leading his wooden ships to engage [[Fort Morgan (Alabama)|Fort Morgan]] while the other ships proceeded into the Bay itself. ''Winnebago'' and ''Chickasaw'' were the third and fourth monitors in line, respectively, as the two more heavily armored {{sclass|Canonicus|monitor}}s, {{USS|Tecumseh|1863|2}} and {{USS|Manhattan|1863|2}}, preceeded them.<ref>Wilson, pp. 120, 122</ref> ''Tecumseh'' struck a [[naval mine|torpedo]] in front of the fort and a small boat from the [[gunboat]] {{USS|Metacomet|1863|2}} rescued 10 survivors and delivered them to ''Winnebago''.<ref>Kinney, p. 389</ref> The latter's aft turret had jammed during her bombardment of Fort Morgan while ''Chickasaw''{{'}}s [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] had been riddled with holes, significantly reducing her speed.<ref>Wilson, p. 123</ref>

The Confederate ironclad ''Tennessee II'' attacked Farragut's wooden ships without much effect after they had passed the Confederate forts and she was engaged by ''Winnebago'' before she disengaged and briefly took shelter under Fort Morgan's guns. About a half hour later, the ironclad attacked Farragut's ships again. The monitors were not initially engaged, but ''Chickasaw'' managed to assume a position by the ''Tennessee''{{'}}s stern and fired repeatedly at [[point-blank range]].<ref>Wilson, pp. 127<U+2013>31</ref> Her shots failed to penetrate the ''Tennessee''{{'}}s armor, but they did jam the armored shutter for the stern gun port and cut her exposed steering chains, rendering her unable to steer. When the crew attempted to unjam the shutter, one shell struck the edge of the shutter, creating fragments that killed the machinist attempting to knock out the shutter's retaining pin and broke [[Admiral]] [[Franklin Buchanan]]'s leg. This damage, together with damage inflicted by the other Union ships, persuaded [[Commander (naval)|Commander]] [[James D. Johnston]] to surrender his ship.<ref>Johnston, p. 404</ref>

The two monitors remained in Mobile Bay and subsequently [[Siege of Fort Morgan|bombarded Fort Morgan]] and [[Siege of Fort Gaines|Fort Gaines]] until they surrendered less than three weeks later.<ref name=chi/><ref name=win/> After supporting forces near the mouth of the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] during the summer, ''Kickapoo'' was transferred to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron in October for operations against Mobile itself;<ref name=kic>{{cite DANFS | title = Kickapoo | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/k3/kickapoo.htm | accessdate =1 January 2013 }}</ref> ''Milwaukee'' was also transferred to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron that same month.<ref name=mil>{{cite DANFS | title = Milwaukee | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m11/milwaukee-i.htm | accessdate =1 January 2013 }}</ref>
 
Union forces were too weak to attack the city itself until March 1865. The monitors moved up the [[Blakeley River]] at the end of the month to cut off Confederate communications with [[Spanish Fort, Alabama|Spanish Fort]] while Union troops [[Battle of Spanish Fort|besieged the fort]]. ''Milwaukee'' and ''Winnebago'' [[sortie]]d upriver on 28 March to attack a Confederate transport and ''Milwaukee'' struck a torpedo while returning from the sortie. Her entire crew survived and was rescued by ''Kickapoo''. The following day ''Kickapoo'' rescued the crew of the monitor {{USS|Osage|1863|2}} which had also struck a torpedo and sunk. After the occupation of [[Selma, Alabama]] in early April, ''Winnebago'' escorted a troop convoy to Selma and [[Montgomery, Alabama]] and then blockaded the [[Tombigbee River]] to prevent the ironclad [[CSS Nashville (1864)|''Nashville'']] and other Confederate ships from interfering with Union forces.<ref name=chi/><ref name=win/><ref name=mil/><ref name=kic/>

After the war, the three surviving ships were [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] and later sold on 12 September 1874.<ref name=chi/><ref name=win/><ref name=kic/> ''Chickasaw''{{'}}s new owners converted her to sidewheel propulsion and she became a coal and railroad ferry until 1944 when she was scuttled.
