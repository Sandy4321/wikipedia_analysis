'''Thomas James Whittaker''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] ([[July 21]], [[1898]] <U+2013> [[October 24]], [[1956]]) was an [[England|English]] [[football (soccer)|football]] player, trainer and manager, chiefly associated with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal Football Club]]

Whittaker was born at East Cavalry Barracks, [[Aldershot]], [[Hampshire]], but grew up in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] from the age of three weeks. He spent his early football career in the [[North East England|North East of England]] as a youth player, whilst training as a marine  [[engineer]], later working in that role for Hawthorn Leslie & Co of [[Tyneside]]. He was called up to the [[British Army]], signing up for the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]], in 1917, moving to [[Lydd]] in [[Kent]], before later switching to the [[Royal Navy]]. He was [[demobilised]] in 1919.

In the meantime, he had continued playing football for his regiment, and after serving his country in [[World War I]], Whittaker forewent his engineering career and joined [[Leslie Knighton]]'s [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in November 1919. He first played as centre-forward then as wing-half. He signed as a professional in January 1920 and made his debut in a 1-0 defeat away to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on [[April 6]] [[1920]] and became a regular in the side in the 1920s, playing 70 times for the club and scoring two goals.

He toured [[Australia]] as part of [[the Football Association]] side in 1925, but during the tour, in a match in [[Wollongong]] he  broke his [[knee cap]] and was forced to retire from playing. Resolving to carry on in football, he joined Arsenal's coaching staff and entered study as a [[physiotherapist]]. He became Arsenal's first team trainer under [[Herbert Chapman]] in 1927 (whilst still younger than many of the players on the pitch). Whittaker had an important role under Chapman in reforming the training and physiotherapy regime at the club, and played an essential part in the club's successes of the 1930s.

After Chapman's death in 1934, Whittaker continued to serve under his successor, [[George Allison]], and also became a trainer for the [[England national football team|England national team]]. The [[Second World War]] saw Whittaker work as an [[Air Raid Precautions|ARP]] warden, before becoming a pilot in the [[Royal Air Force]], achieving the rank of [[Squadron Leader]]. For his service on missions on [[D-Day]], he was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]].

With the end of the war, Whittaker resumed his role as trainer at Arsenal. After Allison's retirement in 1947, Whittaker became the club's new manager; under him the club won the [[Football League Division One|League]] in [[1947-48 in English football|1947-48]] and [[1952-53 in English football|1952-53]] and the [[FA Cup]] in [[1949-50 in English football|1949-50]]. However, the club's success waned in the 1950s, with Whittaker unable to attract any major stars to the club. The strain of looking after an entire club took its toll on Whittaker, with fatal consequences. He died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the [[University College Hospital]], [[London]] in 1956, at the age of 58.
