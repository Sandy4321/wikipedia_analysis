The assistant principals are Daniel Levy, Grade 8 and Rhonda Jackson, Grade 7 . 

==Soil Contamination at Former Site==
In January 2001, the school remained closed for nearly two weeks after the end of the winter vacation when the [[Department of Environmental Protection|DEP]] found high concentrations of [[lead]], [[carcinogens]] and other toxins in the soil surrounding the building, as well as at the sports field across the street.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E2D8153DF937A25752C0A9679C8B63  As New Term Nears, Town Is Split on the Safety of a Middle School Built on a Landfill] by David M. Herszenhorn, The New York Times, January 14, 2001</ref>  It was soon revealed that the building had been constructed on the site of a previous [[toxic waste]] disposal ground in the 1950s.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E7DF153EF933A05755C0A9649C8B63  A School on a Dump Site Divides Hamden] by Richard Weizel, The New York Times, June 30, 2002</ref>  This was followed by claims that the school had seen unusually high rate of death among faculty members in their 50s due to [[cancer]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Crews took action to make the building as safe an environment as possible as classes commenced.  However, residents voiced concern led to plans for the construction of a new building on a Dixwell Avenue site.  The project began in September 2004 and the new Hamden Middle School was completed in time for the start of the 2006 school-year.

==The New Hamden Middle School==
On September 5, 2006 Hamden Middle School opened its doors to at least one thousand students. As of the 2008-2009 school year progressed, the estimated school population was calculated at 870 students. All students are assigned one of five houses for either 7th or 8th grade. 2 houses per grade contain the TAG (Talented and Gifted) students. Houses on both floors consist of the same colors: peach, yellow, blue, green, and purple. The eighth grade is on the first floor and the seventh is on the second. Although the school is for 7th and 8th graders, the school takes in 6th and 5th graders from elementary schools for the Advanced Math Placement (AMP) program in the morning.
