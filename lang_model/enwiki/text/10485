'''''Dustbin Baby''''' is a [[BBC]] television film directed by [[Juliet May]], based on [[Jacqueline Wilson]]'s 2001 [[Dustbin Baby|novel of the same name]]. It was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 21 December 2008. The film stars [[Dakota Blue Richards]] as April, a troubled teenager who was abandoned in a [[dustbin]] as an infant, and [[Juliet Stevenson]] as Marion Bean, April's adoptive mother. [[David Haig]] stars as Elliot, Marion's friend and colleague. The screenplay was written by [[Helen Blakeman]], and the film was produced by [[Kindle Entertainment]]. ''Dustbin Baby'' deals with themes including [[maternal bonding]], [[bullying]], and [[Juvenile delinquency|youth crime]]. The story revolves around April running away on her fourteenth birthday, while Marion searches for her. April's life is recounted in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] as she meets people and visits places that are significant to her.

Both Wilson and critics responded positively to the film, with Wilson saying she thought it was the best film adaptation of any of her works. It was released on DVD on 12 January 2009. ''Dustbin Baby'' was awarded the [[International Emmy]] in the Children and Young People category at the 2009 ceremony. Helen Blakeman won a [[Children's BAFTA#British Academy Children's Awards|Children's BAFTA]] for the screenplay, while the film itself was shortlisted for a Children's BAFTA in the Drama category and shortlisted for the Kids' Vote award. The film was also awarded the 2010 KidScreen Award for Best One-off, Special, or TV movie aimed at a Family Audience and the KidScreen Award for Best Acting.

== Plot ==
On April's fourteenth birthday, Marion, her adoptive mother, gives her earrings, not the mobile phone she wanted. They argue, and April leaves for school. After lying to her friends, claiming she has a phone and is going to the dentist's, April chooses to play truant. While at work at a [[stately home]], Marion hears that April has not arrived at school. She talks to her friend and colleague Elliot, who unsuccessfully tries to dissuade her from leaving. April visits the home of Pat Williams, who cared for her as a baby. Pat remembers April and gives her a newspaper cutting telling the story of her discovery as a baby in a dustbin behind a pizza parlour. In a flashback, a young April is seen living with Janet and Daniel Johnson. The Johnsons' relationship is an [[domestic abuse|abusive]] one, leading to Janet's suicide. Meanwhile, Marion goes to April's school, where she talks to April's friends, and realises that they were lied to. April then leaves Pat's home, and travels alone to Janet's grave. Marion continues to search, and, in a shopping centre, meets Elliot, who has joined her. April then visits the now abandoned Sunnyholme Children's Home, where she lived when she was younger. In a flashback, an eight-year old April lives at the Sunnyholme. Cared for by a woman named Mo, April befriends an older girl called Gina and is introduced to Pearl, a girl of her age. Pearl behaves in front of Mo, but actually bullies April. Gina wakes April one night to involve her in a burglary, and, later, Pearl attacks April, holding her head under water, and then tears up April's beloved paper dolls. April confronts Pearl, who she pushes down a flight of stairs, and is reprimanded by Mo. A [[voice-over]] from 14-year-old April says Gina was then "moved on", and, eventually, April is also moved on.

The flashback jumps forward to April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has [[Asperger syndrome]]. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Bean (Marion). A piece of work on family trees leads to the pair fighting. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and, having learnt of her history, apologises for the family tree incident. Banned from going out on a Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere to put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. April goes to the street where she was found as a baby, and stands among the bins. Marion opens April's mobile and rings Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number on the side of a dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her real mother, she has a mother in Marion, and this is just the beginning.

== Production ==
[[File:Jacqueline Wilson.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=A portrait of a bespectacled, smiling middle-aged woman with short, light grey hair.|[[Jacqueline Wilson]] wrote the novel ''[[Dustbin Baby]]'', upon which the film was based.]]
The film's screenplay was based on [[Jaqueline Wilson]]'s 2001 novel ''[[Dustbin Baby]]'', and was written by [[Helen Blakeman]], who had previously worked on ''[[Pleasureland]]''. ''Dustbin Baby'' was co-commissioned by [[CBBC]] and [[BBC One]], and was produced by [[Kindle Entertainment]], a production company specialising in children's television. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', the film was billed as "a key part of BBC1's Christmas family line-up".<ref>{{cite news |first= Leigh|last= Holmwood|title= Sneak preview of new BBC1 drama Dustbin Baby|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/organgrinder/2008/nov/26/dustbin-baby-bbc|publisher= ''[[The Guardian]]''|date= 26 November 2008|accessdate=21 December 2008 }}</ref> Blakeman said that when she had read the novel, she "knew it was something [she] had to write".<ref name="Helen">{{cite news |first= Joe|last= Riley|title= Helen<U+2019>s tale of woe|url= http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/views/liverpool-columnists/echo-columnists/2008/12/19/helen-s-tale-of-woe-100252-22509772/|publisher= ''[[Liverpool Echo]]''|date= 19 December 2008|accessdate=21 December 2008 }}</ref> The film's executive producers were Anne Brogan and Melanie Stokes for Kindle, with Sue Nott as executive producer for CBBC. The producer was Julia Ouston.<ref name="adapts"/> Director [[Juliet May]], at the time of filming, had 14-year-old twins, and so found "the fact that the lead, April, is 14 years old ... very interesting" as she felt she could "kind of understand 14-year-old children".<ref>[[Juliet May|May, Juliet]]. ''Behind the Bin''. Event occurs at approximately 2:40.</ref>

Though the "gritty realism" of Wilson's novels was different from [[Dakota Blue Richards]]'s first role as [[Lyra Belacqua]] in ''[[The Golden Compass (film)|The Golden Compass]]'', she was happy to take on the character of April.<ref name="interview"/> She said she "can really relate to the characters" in Wilson's novels, but found that April was "a really different person" to her.<ref name="interview"/> Wilson, who had previously seen Richards in ''The Golden Compass'', was "over the moon to hear she was going to be in ''Dustbin Baby''.<ref>[[Jacqueline Wilson|Wilson, Jacqueline]]. ''Behind the Bin''. Event occurs at approximately 7:37.</ref> Richards was to play the 14-year-old April, but other actresses were required to play younger versions of the character. Lucy Hutchinson, who was five at the time of filming, played the youngest April. Director Juliet May described her as "one of the most remarkable five year olds I have ever met", saying that "it's like she's not acting at all".<ref>[[Juliet May|May, Juliet]]. ''Behind the Bin''.

Juliet Stevenson said she was attracted to the part of Marion as "it's very boring playing versions of yourself", and because she did at the time have a 14-year-old daughter.<ref name="interview">{{cite news |first= Bernadette|last= McNulty|title= Dustbin Baby|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3851819/Dustbin-Baby.html|publisher= ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''|date= 19 December 2008|accessdate=21 December 2008 }}</ref> David Haig filmed ''Dustbin Baby'', along with three other television appearances that summer, to earn money to help support his family while he appeared in the play ''[[Loot (play)|Loot]]''.

I am looking forward to seeing the end result immensely."<ref name="Kindle"/>

The BBC purposefully searched for an actress with Asperger syndrome to play the part of Poppy. [[Lizzy Clark]] auditioned for the part after her mother saw an advert on an autism website. Clark was selected to play Poppy, and the role in ''Dustbin Baby'' was her first experience of professional acting.<ref name="asperger">{{cite news |title= Fame for actress with Asperger syndrome|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/content/articles/2008/09/16/aspergers_actress_feature.shtml|publisher= BBC|date=16 August 2008|accessdate=30 July 2009}}</ref> Clark was the first actress with Asperger syndrome to portray a fictional character with the condition. Clark, who has since campaigned with her mother against characters with conditions such as Asperger syndrome being played by actors without the condition, said "My Asperger's made some things on the film set difficult at first, like dealing with the sudden noise of the storyboard, but I was soon so focused on acting that I didn't notice anything else."<ref>{{cite news |title= Mentally disabled actors are victims of modern 'blacking-up', says campaigner|author= Hill, Amelia|newspaper= [[The Observer]]|date= 15 November 2009|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/nov/15/disabled-actors-television-campaign|accessdate= 15 August 2010}}</ref>

== Themes ==
[[File:Dustbin Baby- April.jpg|thumb|right|alt=April walking between a graffiti-covered wall and a canal|The "present" April on her journey of self-discovery.]]
Blakeman said that she read the book in a single sitting, before "crying her eyes out".<ref name="Helen"/> The film includes the themes of bullying, youth crime, domestic violence, unwanted pregnancy, and [[Adolescent psychology|teenage angst]].<ref name="Helen"/> For Blakeman, April's "heartbreaking journey in searching for her real mum is also about being brave enough to let love in."<ref name="Helen"/> [[Tom Sutcliffe (broadcaster)|Tom Sutcliffe]], writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', spoke of the limits of taboo themes in family dramas, and said the film's "account of a life lived in care couldn't have had swearing, or casual drug use, and when a shadow fell over a child's bed at night, it wasn't the care-home manager coming to exercise some horrible {{sic|[[droit du seigneur|droit de seigneur]]}}, as it might have been in an adult drama".<ref name="independent">{{cite news |first= Tom|last= Sutcliffe|title= The Weekend's Television|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/the-weekends-television-lark-rise-to-candleford-sun-bbc1brdustbin-baby-sun-bbc1brbrrussell-brands-christmas-ponderland-sun-channel-4br-1207076.html|publisher= ''[[The Independent]]''|date= 22 December 2008|accessdate=22 December 2008 }}</ref> The film also addressed the theme of Asperger syndrome through the character of Poppy. The BBC claimed that Clark, who has the condition herself, was able to offer "a unique take" on the role.<ref name="asperger"/> Steveson summarised the themes of the film, saying that "At the centre of the story, Marion finds out that she loves this girl. And that is an amazing liberation when you discover someone more important to you than you are. That is what is incredible about becoming a parent <U+2013> you care about your child more than you care about yourself."<ref name="interview"/>

On ''Behind the Bin'', a making-of documentary about ''Dustbin Baby'', Wilson said that "lots and lots of people will identify with" the central theme of adoption, as at fourteen "you start to look at your mum and dad and think 'I'm nothing like them', and everyone seems to have fantasies about that they were adopted or something, and so I think that it's a typical teenage thing that you question who you are".<ref>[[Jacqueline Wilson|Wilson, Jacqueline]]. ''Behind the Bin''. Event occurs at approximately 3:33.</ref> Richards says that she likes the idea that April "went on a journey to try and find herself" as "a lot of people [her age] try and do that because a lot of people get to the point where they're not really sure who they are any more".<ref>[[Dakota Blue Richards|Richards, Dakota Blue]]. ''Behind the Bin''. Event occurs at approximately 4:40.</ref> Richards also discusses the [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] of April's [[paper doll]]s, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is "still the same person", but that she is "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings".<ref>[[Dakota Blue Richards|Richards, Dakota Blue]].

Stevenson described the character of Marion as "cranky, stubborn and lonely", saying that living alone has made her "become quite idiotic and eccentric". When the character of April arrives, Stevenson explains that "Marion has to go from nought to 80 in terms of parenting. There are lots of reasons she wouldn't get it right" which leads on to the guilt and anxiety that Marion suffers when April runs away.<ref name="interview"/> Stevenson compared her own difficulties of parenting to Marion's, saying "it is easier for me than someone like Marion because I have had 14 years experience".<ref name="interview"/> Richards spoke of the character of April, saying that "the residential schools and children's homes were completely different from my life. [April] doesn't feel connected to anybody and she struggles to know who she is".<ref name="interview"/>

== Reception ==
Wilson, after seeing an early screening of ''Dustbin Baby'', said that it was the best film adaptation of any of her works.<ref name="Helen"/> Haig said that the film was his favourite of his summer projects, saying "it was a terrific story and very touchingly done. I think Juliet Stevenson was very funny and moving in it".<ref name="Loot"/> Critics also responded positively. In an article in ''[[The Times]]'' David Chater awarded the programme the TV choice of the day, describing it as "tremendous", and "the wonderful surprise of Christmas".<ref>{{cite news |first= David|last= Chater|url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5358447.ece|title= TV Choice|publisher= ''[[The Times]]''|date= 20 December 2008|accessdate=22 December 2008 | location=London}}</ref> The film was described in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' as a "rare treat", as it is "something that teenagers and parents can watch together".<ref name="interview"/> This view was shared by producer Anne Brogan, who said that the film was something "that parents and children will enjoy watching while giving them much to talk about".<ref name="adapts">{{cite news |first= Katherine|last= Rushton|title= BBC adapts Jacqueline Wilson for Christmas|url= http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/commissioning/interview/2008/10/bbc_adapts_jacqueline_wilson_for_christmas.html|publisher= ''[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]''|date= 1 October 2008|accessdate=22 December 2008 }}</ref> Tom Sutcliffe, writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', said Stevenson was "good as a woman who was far more comfortable in the past than the present", and that "her performance was more than matched by that of Dakota Blue Richards as April, mostly banked-down and wary but prone to sudden wild flashes of anger". He criticised some of the "implausibilities", saying that the plot was, at times, "a lot kinder than the world might have been", but said that "it still made you well up with its final reconciliation" with emotion that had been "honestly earned".<ref name="independent"/> Euan Ferguson, in an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'', said that the film "hooked and haunted", and added that Stevenson played Marion like "a kind of updated" [[Jean Brodie]].<ref>{{cite news |first= Euan|last= Ferguson|title= Hail these Plasticine scene stealers|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/dec/28/wallace-and-gromit-blackadder|publisher= ''[[The Guardian]]''|date= 28 December 2008|accessdate=28 December 2008 }}</ref> During its initial run on BBC One, ''Dustbin Baby'' was watched by 2.3 million viewers, giving it a 15.4% share of the audience.<ref>{{cite news |first= Chris|last= Curtis|title= BBC1/ITV1 boosted by Xmas dramas|url= http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2008/12/bbc1itv1_boosted_by_xmas_dramas.html|publisher= ''[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]''|date= 22 December 2008|accessdate=22 December 2008 }}</ref>
