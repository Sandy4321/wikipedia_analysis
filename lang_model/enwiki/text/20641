== Teaching career ==
After graduation in the 1950s Kotva became a teacher. As a practising Christian, Kotva was regarded as politically suspect and potentially disloyal by the Czechoslovak [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948<U+2013>1989)|communist administration]]; he was permitted to teach only in remote rural regions.<ref>Frankov<U+00E1>, Jana [http://www.bbc.co.uk/czech/domesticnews/story/2004/11/041112_radiofejeton.shtml 'Za V<U+00E1>clavem Kotvou'], BBC Czech service, 2006-11-12</ref>

== Theatre ==
Kotva participated in amateur theatre in his hometown, Radnice, and began acting professionally in [[Ostrava]], at the regional [[Divadlo Petra Bezru<U+010D>e]] Theater, in 1959. In 1965 he moved to Prague, becoming a founding member of the [[<U+010C>inohern<U+00ED> klub]] theater there. The <U+010C>inohern<U+00ED> klub became a centre of Czech cultural life during the 1960s and remained so during the 1970s. Kotva remained active at the <U+010C>inohern<U+00ED> klub until the 1990s. He won critical acclaim for his roles in classical Russian drama, including [[Gogol]]'s [[The Government Inspector]] and [[The Cherry Orchard]] by [[Anton Chekhov]]. He also made guest appearances at the [[National Theatre (Prague)]].<ref name="FDB.CZ">[http://www.fdb.cz/lidi-zivotopis-biografie/26297-vaclav-kotva.html?PHPSESSID=cf20dd6fc1c878291413efc73e1c835f Profile] at fdb.cz</ref>
