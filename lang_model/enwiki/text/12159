'''Rachel Pollack''' (b. August 17, 1945 in [[Brooklyn, New York]]) is an American [[science fiction]] author, [[comic book]] writer, and expert on [[divinatory tarot]]. Pollack has been a great influence on the women's spirituality movement.

==Tarot Reading==
Pollack's work ''[[78 Degrees of Wisdom]]'' on [[tarot reading]] is commonly referenced by [[tarot]] readers.<ref name="classic">{{cite web | title= Llewellyn.com | url = http://www.llewellyn.com/bookstore/author.php?id=40020&affiliate=HL5X4 | accessdate = 04-08-2008}}</ref>

She wrote ''78 Degrees of Wisdom'' on tarot reading, and has created her own tarot deck called "Shining Woman Tarot" (later "Shining Tribe Tarot").<ref name="Shining Tribe Tarot">{{cite web

| accessdate = 2008-04-15
}}</ref> She also aided in the creation of the "Vertigo Tarot Deck" with illustrator [[Dave McKean]] and author [[Neil Gaiman]], and wrote a book specifically to accompany it.<ref name="Vertigo Tarot">{{cite web

==Comics==
Pollack is best known for her run of issues 64-87 on the comic book ''[[Doom Patrol]]'', on [[DC Comics]]' [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] imprint,<ref name="Vertigo Tarot">{{cite web 
| title = Doom Patrol

}}</ref> which became a cult favorite under [[Grant Morrison]]. A comic fandom legend has it that Pollack was assigned to write the series after writing persistent letters to the editor.<ref name="letters to editor" /> Although the letters are a matter of record,<ref name="letters to editor">{{Cite journal 
| title = Doom Patrol

| postscript = <!--None-->
}}</ref> it's unknown if they were actually the cause of her employment.
During her tenure Pollack dealt with such rarely addressed comic-book topics as [[menstruation]], [[sexual identity]], and [[transsexuality]]. Pollack's run ended two years later, with the book's cancellation. Pollack also wrote a ''[[Brother Power the Geek]]'' one-shot, and eleven issues of a ''[[New Gods]]'' series for DC Comics (the first five co-authored with [[Tom Peyer]]). Author Neil Gaiman has sometimes consulted Rachel Pollack on the tarot for his stories.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Pollack created an actual tarot spread for one of Gaiman's books.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Fiction==

Her [[magical realism]]<ref name="glbtgodmotherreview">{{cite web | url=http://www.glbtfantasy.com/?section=fantasy&auth=Rachel+Pollack | accessdate = 2008-09-19 | title = GLBT Fantasy review of Godmother Night}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> novels explore worlds imbued with elements pulled from a number of traditions, faiths, and [[religion]]s.

Several of her novels are set in an alternative reality that resembles modern America, but an America of Bright Beings, where magic and ritual, religion and [[thaumaturgy]] are the norms<ref name="Hurst">{{cite web | title = Temporary Agency | url = http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/l.j.hurst/rp_tempagy.htm | accessdate = 2008-09-06}}</ref>.

==Nonfiction==
Her book ''The Body Of The Goddess'' is an exploration of the history of the Goddess. Rachel Pollack uses the image of the Goddess in many of her works.

==Influences==
Pollack is [[Jewish]],<ref name="Llewellyn">{{cite web | title = New Worlds Article | url = http://www.llewellyn.com/bookstore/article.php?id=644 | accessdate = 2008-09-06}}</ref> and has frequently written about the [[Kabbalah]], most notably in ''The Kabbalah Tree''.<ref name="book biblio" />
 
Pollack is a transsexual woman and has written frequently on transgender issues.<ref name="testosterone">{{cite book  | last = Valerio  | first = Max Wolf  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Testosterone Files: My Hormonal and Social Transformation from Female to Male  | publisher = Seal Press  | year = 2006  | location = Berkeley  | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9XEwxy3XARgC  | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-58005-173-1  | page = 147}}</ref><ref>{{cite book  | last = Israel  | first = Gianna E.  | authorlink =   | coauthors = Tarver II, Donald E.  | title = Transgender Care: Recommended Guidelines, Practical Information & Personal Accounts  | publisher = [[Temple University Press]]  | year = 2001  | location = Philadelphia  | url = http://books.google.com/?id=IlPX6E5glDEC&pg=RA1-PA269&dq=Rachel+Pollack+transsexual  | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-56639-852-5  | page = 269}}</ref>. In ''Doom Patrol'' she introduced [[Coagula]], a transsexual character. She has also written several essays on transsexualism, attacking the notion that it is a "sickness," <ref>Pollack, Rachel. [http://www.annelawrence.com/twr/archetypal.html "Archetypal Transsexuality."] Retrieved on 10-20-2008.</ref> instead saying that it is a passion. She has emphasized the revelatory aspects of transsexualism, saying that "the {{sic|trance-sexual}} woman sacrifices her social identity as a male, her personal history, and finally the very shape of her body to a knowledge, a desire, which overpowers all rational understanding and proof."

''A Secret Woman'' features a police detective who is transgendered and Jewish. The detective utters the prayer, "Blessed art thou oh G-d who made me not a woman. Double blessed is Doctor Green who has."<ref name="A Secret Woman">Pollack, Rachel. ''A Secret Woman: A Mystery.'' New York: St. Martin's Minotaur, 2002.</ref> Rachel Pollack created the characters known as 'the bandage people' for her ''Doom Patrol'' run. The bandage people are 'sexually remaindered spirits' who died in sexual accidents. The initials srs came from the medical term 'sex reassignment surgery'.  Rachel wrote the essay "The Transsexual Book of The Dead" for the anthology ''Phallus Palace''. This article is concerning [[transmen]].  Fairy tales such as the Brothers Grimm have influenced many of Ms. Pollack's writings. Her new book 'Tarot of Perfection' is a book of fairy tales based on the tarot.

==Teaching==

For nearly 20 years Pollack has been teaching seminars with Tarot author [[Mary K. Greer]] at the [[Omega Institute]], in [[Rhinebeck, New York]].<ref name="Women In Tarot" /> She has also done seminars for several years in [[California]] in conjunction with Greer, and she co-presented a breakthrough seminar with Tarot author Johanna Gargiulo-Sherman on Tarot and [[psychic]] ability, using her own Shining Tribe Tarot and Gargulio-Sherman's Sacred Rose Tarot.<ref name="Women In Tarot" /> Pollack is also a popular lecturer at Tarot seminars and symposiums such as LATS (Los Angeles Tarot Symposium), BATS (Bay Area Tarot Symposium), and the Readers Studio.<ref name="Women In Tarot" /> Pollack currently teaches creative writing at [[Goddard College]]. Her most recent work is included in the anthology called ''Interfictions: An Anthology of Interstitial Writing'' edited by Theodora Goss. Pollack has taught [[English studies|English]] at [[State University of New York]].
