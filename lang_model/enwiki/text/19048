'''Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 31''' was a World War I "hunting group" (i.e., fighter squadron) of the ''[[Luftstreitkr<U+00E4>fte]]'', which was the forerunner to the [[Luftwaffe]]. As one of the original German fighter squadrons, the unit would score 35 verified aerial victories, including five wins over enemy observation balloons.<ref>{{cite book |title=Above the Lines: The Aces and Fighter Units of the German Air Service, Naval Air Service and Flanders Marine Corps, 1914-1918 |page= 42 }}</ref>

In turn, their casualties for the war would amount to nine pilots [[killed in action]], two dead in aircraft accidents, six [[wounded in action]], and two injured in accidents.<ref>{{cite book |title=Above the Lines: The Aces and Fighter Units of the German Air Service, Naval Air Service and Flanders Marine Corps, 1914-1918 |page= 42 }}</ref>
