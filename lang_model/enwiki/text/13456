'''Maurice Gerrard "Mo" Douglass''' (born February 12, 1964 in [[Muncie, Indiana]]) is a [[high school football]] [[head coach]] (known as '''Coach Doug''') and former [[American football]] [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] who played eleven seasons in the [[National Football League]] for the [[Chicago Bears]] and the [[New York Giants]].  Douglass played [[college football]] at the [[University of Kentucky]] after transferring from [[Coffeyville Community College]].

Douglass played nine seasons with the Bears on [[special teams]] and as a [[nickel back]].  He then played two seasons with the Giants.  In his early years, he was a witness in a federal trial involving illegal activities by a pair of [[sports agent]]s.

In high school, he had played for [[Trotwood-Madison High School]] and graduated in 1982.  He returned to coach the team in 2001.  In 2007, he led the team to the playoffs for the first time in 25 years.  That year, he was accused of luring players from other teams and found guilty the following year, which was met with a brief suspension.

==Coaching career==
In 2001 he became the football coach at his alma mater Trotwood. He transformed the program by spending time creating player highlight reels, responding to college recruiters and taking his athletes on college tours.  Subsequently, the athletes began getting college [[scholarship]] offers.  In his first seven years nearly 100 of his players went on to play college football and over one-third at [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] programs.  He is said to have a relaxed mentoring style of coaching and is known as Coach Doug.<ref name=TTOF/>  In 2007, the team made the playoffs for the first time since 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totallytrotwood.com/RamsvsCougars2007FootbalPlayoff.htm|title=2007 Football Playoff Trotwood vs Edgewood|accessdate=2010-10-22|publisher=Totally Trotwood}}</ref>  That year, he was charged with illegally recruiting athletes to play for his team. Upon review by the [[Ohio High School Athletic Association]], he and his staff were found guilty of the charge.  In 2008, he was placed on suspension for three weeks and his offensive coordinator resigned.  The school was placed on two year probation.<ref name=TTOF/>
