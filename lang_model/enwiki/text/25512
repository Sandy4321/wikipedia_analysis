'''Frederick Russell Burnham''' [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (May 11, 1861 <U+2013> September 1, 1947) was an American [[reconnaissance|scout]] and world traveling adventurer known for his service to the [[British Army]] in [[colonial Africa]] and for teaching [[Scoutcraft|woodcraft]]<!-- Do not change link to "Woodcraft". --> to [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]],<ref name="scoutingforboys" /> becoming one of the inspirations for the founding of the international [[Scouting|Scouting Movement]].<ref name="ReligiousEd" /><ref name="1944jul_boyslife" />

Burnham had little formal education, attending high school but never graduating. He began his career at 14 in the [[American Southwest]] as a scout and he served as a civilian tracker for the [[U.S. Army]] in the [[Apache Wars]]. Sensing the [[Old West]] was getting too tame, as an adult Burnham went to Africa where his background proved useful. He soon became an officer in the British Army, serving in several battles there. During this time, Burnham became friends with Baden-Powell, and passed on to him both his outdoor skills and his spirit for what would later become known as Scouting.

Burnham eventually moved on to become involved in espionage, oil, conservation, writing and business. His descendants are still active in the Scout Movement.

==Early life==
[[File:Burnham skagway alaska 1899.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Frederick Burnham in [[Arizona Territory]] during 1881.]]

Burnham was born to a [[missionary]] family on an Indian reservation in Tivoli, [[Minnesota]]. His father [[Edwin Otway Burnham]] was from [[Kentucky]] whilst his mother had immigrated to America from England.<ref name="lott1981" /> During the [[Dakota War of 1862]], [[New Ulm, Minnesota]] was attacked by [[Taoyateduta]] (Little Crow) and his [[Sioux]] warriors. Burnham's mother, Rebecca (Elizabeth) Russell Burnham, hid him outside in a basket of green corn husks and fled for her life. Once the Sioux had been driven away the mother returned to find the house burned down. Her young son was safe, fast asleep in the basket and protected only by the corn husks.<ref name="Davis 1906" /><ref name="scouting" />

The young Burnham attended schools in Iowa and there he met Blanche Blick, who would later become his wife. His family moved to Los Angeles in 1870. Two years later his father, the Reverend [[Edwin Otway Burnham]] of Kentucky died. Reverend Burnham had long been a pioneer and missionary along the border of the Ho Chunk (Winnebago) Indian reservation in Minnesota. While his mother and his then 3 year old younger brother [[Howard Burnham]] returned to Iowa, the 12-year old Burnham stayed in California to make his own way.<ref name="pressreflib" />

For the next three years, Burnham worked as a mounted messenger for the [[Western Union Telegraph Company]] in California and [[Arizona Territory]]. On one occasion his horse was stolen from him by [[Tiburcio Vasquez]], a famous [[Californio]] [[outlaw|bandit]].<ref name="latimes6sep1931" /> At 14, he began his life as a scout and Indian tracker in the [[Apache Wars]]. He traveled in northern Mexico and the American Southwest, including Texas and [[Oklahoma Territory]], earning a living as a buffalo hunter, cowboy, and prospector, and he continued working as a scout. The young Burnham eventually went on to attend high school in California but never graduated.<ref name="pressreflib" /> Burnham was the brother of [[Howard Burnham|Mather Howard Burnham]], a mining engineer and spy, and second cousin of Lt. [[Howard Mather Burnham]], killed in the [[American Civil War]]. Active as a [[Freemason]], Burnham was a member of Excelsior Lodge No. 195.  He rose to become a Thirty-second Degree Mason of the [[Scottish Rite]].<ref name="freemason" />

In 1882, Burnham returned to Arizona and was appointed Deputy Sheriff of [[Pinal County]], but he soon went back to herding cattle and prospecting. He joined the losing side of the [[Pleasant Valley War|Tonto Basin Feud]] before mass killing started, and only narrowly escaped death in Arizona.<ref name="scouting" /><ref name="blackwoodtontobasin" /> He returned to [[Prescott, Iowa]], to visit his childhood sweetheart, Blanche, and the two were married on February 6, 1884.{{sfn|International News Service|1915|p=241}} That same year, he and Blanche settled down to tend to an orange grove in [[Pasadena, California]], but within a year he was back prospecting and scouting.

In the 1880s the American press had been popularizing the notion that the West had been won and there was nothing left to conquer in the United States. This idea changed Burnham's life. Ever the soldier of fortune, he began to look elsewhere for the next undeveloped frontier. When he heard of the work of [[Cecil Rhodes]] and his pioneers in building the [[Cape to Cairo railway]] in Africa, Burnham sold what little he owned and, in 1893, set sail to [[Cape Town, South Africa]], with his wife and young son. He soon joined the [[British South Africa Company]] as a scout and headed north.<ref name="West 1932" />

==Military career==

===First Matabele War===
{{details|First Matabele War}}

Burnham's was first major test in Africa came in 1893. The First Matabele War was fought between 1893 and 1894 in the country today called [[Zimbabwe]]. It pitted the [[British South Africa Company]] against [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] King [[Lobengula]]. Burnham, his wife, and their six-year-old son had only just arrived in South Africa and were treking North by wagon on their way to [[Matabeleland]] when news of the war broke. Upon their arrival in Matabeleland (now part of Zimbabwe), Burnham immediately signed up as a scout with the British South Africa company and joined the fighting. [[Leander Starr Jameson]], Chief Magistrate of Mashonaland (now part of Zimbabwe), had hoped to defeat the Ndebele quickly by capturing Lobengula at his royal city of [[Bulawayo]]. Jameson sent Burnham and a small group of scouts ahead to report on the situation in Bulawayo. While on the outskirts of town they watched as the Ndebele burned down and destroyed everything in sight. By the time the Company's troops had arrived in force, Lobengula and his warriors had fled and there was little left of old Bulawayo. The Company then moved into the remains of Bulawayo, established a base, and sent out patrols to find Lobengula. The most famous of these patrols was the Shangani Patrol led by Maj. [[Allan Wilson (Major)|Allan Wilson]] and the man he chose as his Chief of Scouts, Fred Burnham.{{sfn|Donovan|1894|p=271}}

====Shangani Patrol====
{{details|Shangani Patrol}}

After he found that Bulawayo had been abandoned, Jameson dispatched a column of soldiers to locate and capture Lobengula. The column, led by Maj. [[Patrick William Forbes|Patrick Forbes]], camped on the south bank of the Shangani River about {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north-east of the village of Lupane on the evening of December 3, 1893. The next day, late in the afternoon, a dozen men under the command of Maj. Wilson were sent across the river to patrol the area. The Wilson Patrol came across a group of Matabele women and children who claimed to know Lobengula's whereabouts. Burnham, who served as the lead scout of the Wilson patrol, sensed a trap and advised Wilson to withdraw, but Wilson ordered his patrol to advance.<ref name="efknight" />

Soon afterwards, the patrol found the king and Wilson sent a message back to the [[laager]] requesting reinforcements. Forbes, however, was unwilling to set off across the river in the dark, so he sent only 20 more men, under the command of Henry Borrow, to reinforce Wilson's patrol. Forbes intended to send the main body of troops and artillery across the river the following morning; however, the main column was ambushed by Matabele warriors and delayed. Wilson's patrol too came under attack, but the Shangani River had swollen and there was now no possibility of retreat. In desperation, Wilson sent Burnham and two other scouts, Pearl "Pete" Ingram (a [[Montana]] cowboy) and William Gooding (an Australian), to cross the Shangani River, find Forbes, and bring reinforcements. In spite of a shower of bullets and spears, the three made it to Forbes, but the battle raging there was just as intense as the one they had left, and there was no hope of anyone reaching Wilson in time. As Burnham loaded his rifle to beat back the Matabele warriors, he quietly said to Forbes, "I think I may say that we are the sole survivors of that party."<ref name="hhensman" /> Wilson, Borrow, and their men were indeed surrounded by hundreds of Matabele warriors; escape was impossible, and all were killed.<ref name="efknight" /><ref name="hhensman" /> 

Colonial-era histories called this the [[Shangani Patrol]], and hailed Wilson and Borrow as national heroes.<ref name="lobengula" /> For his service in the war, Burnham was presented the [[British South Africa Company Medal]], a gold watch, and a share of a 300&nbsp;acre (120&nbsp;ha) tract of land in [[Matabeleland]]. It was here that Burnham uncovered many artifacts in the huge granite ruins of the ancient civilization of [[Great Zimbabwe]].<ref name="Davis 1906" />

===Northern Rhodesia Exploration===
In 1895, Burnham went on to oversee and lead the massive Northern Territories (BSA) Exploration Co. expedition which first established for the British South Africa Company that major copper deposits existed in [[North-Eastern Rhodesia]].<ref name="burnham1899" /><ref name="baxter1970" /><ref name="times9may1899" /> Along the [[Kafue River]] in then North-Eastern Rhodesia, Burnham saw many similarities to copper deposits he had worked in the United States, and he encountered native peoples wearing copper bracelets.<ref name="scouting" /> His expeditions in Rhodesia were so important that the [[Royal Geographical Society]] elected him a Fellow.<ref name="hough2010" /> Later, the British South Africa Company built the mining towns of the [[Copperbelt]] and a railroad to transport the ore through [[Mozambique]].<ref name="juang2008" />

===Second Matabele War===
[[File:After mlimo.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing by Frank Dadd. R.I.: "Burnham & Armstrong after the assassination of Mlimo. Matabele warriors in hot pursuit."]]
{{details|Second Matabele War}}

In March 1896, the Matabele again revolted against the authority of the British South Africa Company in what was then called the [[Second Matabele War]] but is now celebrated in [[Zimbabwe]] as the First War of Independence. Mlimo, the Matabele spiritual leader, is credited with fomenting much of the anger that led to this confrontation. Matabeleland defenses were in disarray due to the ill-fated [[Jameson Raid]], and in the first few months of the war alone hundreds of white settlers were killed. With few troops to support them, the settlers quickly built a laager in the centre of Bulawayo on their own and mounted patrols under such figures as Burnham, [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]], and [[Frederick Selous|Selous]]. An estimated 50,000 Matabele retreated into their stronghold of the [[Matobo Hills]] near Bulawayo, a region that became the scene of the fiercest fighting against the white settler patrols.<ref name="fcselous" />

====Assassination of Mlimo====
The turning point in the war came when Burnham and a young scout named Bonar Armstrong found their way through Matobo Hills to the sacred cave where Mlimo had been hiding. Not far from the cave was a village of about 100 huts filled with many warriors. The two scouts tethered their horses to a thicket and crawled on their bellies, screening their slow, cautious movements by means of branches held before them. Once inside the cave, they waited until Mlimo entered.<ref name="nyt25jun1896" /> Mlimo was said to be about 60 years old, with very dark skin, sharp-featured; American news reports of the time described him as having a cruel, crafty look. Burnham and Armstrong waited until Mlimo entered the cave and started his dance of immunity, at which point Burnham shot Mlimo just below the heart.<ref name="nyt25jun1896" />

}}

The two scouts then leapt over the dead Mlimo and ran down a trail toward their horses. Hundreds of warriors, encamped nearby, picked up their arms and searched for the attackers. To distract the Matabele, Burnham set fire to the village. The two men got on their horses and rode back to Bulawayo. Shortly after learning of the assassination of Mlimo, Cecil Rhodes boldly walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the [[impi]] to lay down their arms, thus ending the Second Matabele War.<ref name="farwell" /><ref name="dleebaert" />

===Klondike Gold Rush===
With the Matabele war over, Burnham decided it was time to leave Africa and move on to other adventures. The family returned to California where Burnham left his wife and young son Bruce with his mother. Soon after, he and his eldest son Roderick, then 12 years old, traveled to Alaska and the [[Yukon]] to prospect in the [[Klondike Gold Rush]].<ref name="scouting" /> Upon hearing of the [[Spanish-American War]], Burnham rushed home to volunteer his services, but before he could get to the fighting the war was already over. Burnham then returned to the Klondike. Colonel [[Theodore Roosevelt]] regretted this as much as Burnham and paid him a great tribute in his book.<ref name="pressreflib" />

===Second Boer War===

{{details|Second Boer War}}

The [[Second Boer War]] was fought between the British and two independent [[Boer]] republics, the [[South African Republic]] (Transvaal Republic) and the [[Orange Free State]] over long-simmering strife between them and which side would control the very lucrative [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush|Witwatersrand gold mines]].{{sfn|Pakenham|1979||pp=493<U+2013>495}} [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts| Field Marshal Roberts]] was appointed to take overall command of British forces in response to a string of defeats in the early weeks of the war,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27146|supp=|startpage=8541|date=22 December 1899|accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref> including the [[Siege of Mafeking]] in which Baden-Powell, his small regiment of men, and the townspeople had been besieged by thousands of Boer troops since the start of the war. Roberts asked Gen. Carrington, the former commander of the British forces in Matabeleland during the Second Matabele War, who he should appoint as his Chief of Scouts.  Carrington, who three years earlier selected Baden-Powell for his Chief of Staff and gave the order to capture or shoot the Mlimo, replied: "Fred Burnham.  Burnham is the finest scout who ever scouted in Africa... I am told he went to the Yukon in Canada in '97".<ref name="lott1981" /> Only days after he arrived in South Africa on the RMS [[RMS Dunottar Castle|''Dunottar Castle'']] to relieve Gen. [[Redvers Buller]], Roberts contacted Burnham. In January 1900, while prospecting near [[Skagway, Alaska]], Burnham received the following telegram: ''Lord Roberts appoints you on his personal staff as Chief of Scouts. If you accept, come at once the quickest way possible.'' Although [[Cape Town, South Africa]] is at the opposite end of the globe from the Klondike, he left within the hour.<ref name="americanheritage" /> In a step that was unusual for a foreigner, Burnham was given a command post by Lord Roberts and the rank of British Army captain.<ref name="americanheritage" /> Burnham would arrive at the front just before the [[Battle of Paardeberg]]. During the war, Burnham spent much time behind the Boer lines gathering information and blowing up railway bridges and tracks. He was twice captured and twice escaped, but he was also disabled for a time by his near-fatal wounds.

Burnham was first captured during the fighting at [[Sanna's Post]] in the Orange Free State.<ref name="ungerbobs" /> He gave himself up in order to obtain information on the enemy, which he did, and then he escaped from his guards and succeed in reaching British occupied [[Bloemfontein]] safely after two days and nights on the run.<ref name="ungerbobs2" />  The second time he was captured was while trying to warn a British column approaching [[Thaba Nchu|Thaba' Nchu]].<ref name="atlantaconstitution8apr1900" /> He came upon a group of Boers hiding on the banks of the river, toward which the British were even then advancing. Cut off from his own side, Burnham chose to signal the approaching soldiers even though it would expose him to capture. With a red kerchief, Burnham signaled the soldiers to turn back, but the column paid no attention and plodded steadily on into the ambush, while Burnham was at once taken prisoner. In the fight that followed, Burnham pretended to receive a wound in the knee. Limping heavily and groaning with pain, he was placed in a wagon with the officers who really were wounded, and who, in consequence, were not closely guarded. Later that evening, Burnham slipped over the driver's seat, dropped between the two wheels of the wagon, lowered himself and fell between the legs of the oxen on his back in the road. In an instant the wagon had passed over him safely, and while the dust still hung above the trail he rolled rapidly over into the ditch at the side of the road and lay motionless. It was four days before he was able to re-enter the British lines, during which time he had been lying in the open veldt. He had subsisted on one biscuit and two handfuls of "mealies" (i.e., maize).<ref name="scouting" /><ref name="nyt1901" />

On June 2, 1900, during the British March on Pretoria, Burnham was wounded, almost fatally. He was on a mission to cut-off the flow of Boer gold and supplies to and from the sea and to halt the transportation of British prisoners of war out of the Pretoria. He had been scouting alone far to the east behind enemy lines trying to identify the best choke point along the [[Pretoria]]-[[Delagoa Bay]] railway line. He came upon an underpass of a railway bridge, an ideal location to disrupt the trains, but was immediately surrounded by a party of Boers. Burnham instantly fled and he had all but gotten away when his horse was shot and fell, knocking him senseless and pinning him under its dead body. It was night and he was already far away when his horse was shot, so the Boer troopers apparently did not check to see if Burnham had been injured or killed. When he awoke hours later, Burnham was alone and in a dazed state having sustained serious injuries. In spite of his acute agony, Burnham proceeded to creep back to the railway, placed his charges, and blew up the line in two places. He then crept on his hands and knees to an empty animal enclosure to avoid capture and stayed there for two days and nights insensible. The next day, Burnham heard fighting in the distance so he crawled in that direction. By this time he was indifferent as to the source of the gunshots and by chance it was a British patrol that found him. Once in Pretoria the surgeons discovered that Burnham had torn apart his stomach muscles and burst a blood-vessel. His very survival was due only to the fact that he had been without food or water for three days.<ref name="britt1923" />

Sitting L-R: unidentified, Col. [[Maurice Gifford]].]]

Burnham's injuries were so serious that he was ordered to England by Lord Roberts. Two days before leaving for London, he was promoted to the rank of major, having received letters of commendation or congratulations from Baden-Powell, Rhodes, and Field Marshal Roberts.<ref name="scouting" /><ref name="latimes4aug1900" /><ref name="latimes2mar1902" /><ref name="bosher" /> On his arrival in England, Burnham was commanded to dine with [[Queen Victoria]] and to spend the night at [[Osborne House]].<ref name="latimes2feb1930" /> A few months later, after the Queen's death, [[King Edward VII]] personally presented Burnham with the [[Queen's South Africa Medal]] with four bars for the battles at [[Driefontein]] (Mar 10, 1900), [[Johannesburg]] (May 31, 1900), [[Battle of Paardeberg|Paardeberg]] (February 17<U+2013>26, 1900), and [[Cape Colony]] (October 11, 1899 <U+2013> May 31, 1902), in addition to the cross of the [[Distinguished Service Order]],<ref name="latimes2mar1902" /><ref name="nyt28sep1901" /> the second highest decoration in the British Army, for his heroism during the "victorious" March to Pretoria (June 2<U+2013>5, 1900). Burnham received the highest awards of any American who served in the Second Boer War.<ref name="americanheritage" /> Following his investiture, the British press hailed Burnham as: "The King of Army Scouts".{{sfn|Illustrated London News|1902|page=44}}

Burnham's most accomplished soldiers during the Second Boer War were [[Lovat Scouts]], a [[Scottish Highland]] regiment, whom he described as "half wolf and half jackrabbit."<ref name="Plaster 2006 p5" /> These scouts were well practiced in the arts of [[marksmanship]], [[field craft]], and [[Military tactics|tactics]]. After the war, this regiment went on to become the [[British army|British army's]] first [[sniper]] unit.<ref name="Plaster 2006 p5" />

Burnham was already a celebrated scout when he first befriended Baden-Powell during the Second Matabele War. Himself a brilliant outdoorsman, Baden-Powell was a distinguished cavalry officer, and reportedly the finest [[Boar hunting|pig sticker]] in India. During the siege of Bulawayo, the two men rode many times into the Matobo Hills on patrol, and it was in these African hills that Burnham first introduced Baden-Powell to the ways and methods of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], and taught him ''woodcraft''<!-- Do not link this. --> (better known today as [[scoutcraft]]). So impressed was Baden-Powell by Burnham's Scouting spirit that he fondly told people he "sucked him dry" of all he could possibly tell.<ref name="angloboerwarmuseum" /> It was here that Baden-Powell began to wear his signature [[Stetson]] [[campaign hat]] and [[neckerchief]] for the first time.<ref name="jeal" /> Both men recognized that wars were changing markedly and the British Army needed to adapt; so during their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training program in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, [[Tracking (Scouting)|tracking]], [[fieldcraft]], and self-reliance. In Africa, no scout embodied these traits more than Burnham.<ref name="heskethpritchard" /> While Baden-Powell went on to refine the concept of Scouting and become the founder of the international Scouting movement, Burnham has been called the movement's father.<ref name="forster" />

Burnham later became close friends with others involved in the Scouting movement in the United States, such as [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the Chief Scout Citizen, and [[Gifford Pinchot]], the Chief Scout Forester.<ref name="The Official Handbook for Boys 1911" />
The [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) made Burnham an Honorary Scout in 1927,<ref name="Handbook for Boys 1933" /> and for his noteworthy and extraordinary service to the Scouting movement, Burnham was bestowed the highest commendation given by the Boy Scouts of America, the [[Silver Buffalo Award]], in 1936.<ref name="congress-bsa" /> Throughout his life he remained active in Scouting at both the regional and the national level in the United States and he corresponded regularly with Baden-Powell on Scouting topics.

The low-key Burnham and Baden-Powell remained close friends for their long lives. The seal on the Burnham&nbsp;<U+2014> Baden-Powell letters at Yale and [[Stanford University|Stanford]] expired in 2000 and the true depth of their friendship and love of Scouting has again been revealed.<ref name="petervanwyk" /> In 1931, Burnham read the speech dedicating [[Mount Baden-Powell]] in California,<ref name="mtbp" /><ref name="chances p.xxv<U+2013>xxix" /> to his old Scouting friend.<ref name="bpdedication" /> Their friendship, and equal status in the world of Scouting and conservation, is honored with the dedication of the adjoining peak, [[Mount Burnham]],<ref name="dedication" /><ref name="mtburnham" /> in his honor.

Burnham's descendants followed in his footsteps and are active in Scouting and in the military. His son Roderick enlisted in the U.S. Army and fought in [[World War I]] France. His grandson, Frederick Russell Burnham II, was a leader in the BSA and a [[Vietnam War]] veteran. His great-grandson, [[Russell Adam Burnham]] is an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] and was [[United States Army]]'s Soldier of the Year in 2003.<ref name="grandson" /><ref name="soldier2003" />

===Yaqui===
[[File:Esperanza stone burnham1910.jpg|thumb|The Esperanza Stone. Found by Major Frederick Russell Burnham in Mexico (1910)]]

Burnham returned to North America and for the next few years became associated with the [[Yaqui River]] irrigation project in Mexico. While investigating the Yaqui valley for mineral and agricultural resources, Burnham reasoned that a dam could provide year-round water to rich [[alluvial soil]] in the valley; turning the region into one of the garden spots of the world and generate much needed electricity. He purchased water rights and some {{convert|300|acre|km2}} of land in this region and contacted an old friend from Africa, [[John Hays Hammond]], who conducted his own studies and then purchased an additional {{convert|900000|acre|km2}} of this land<U+2014>an area the size of [[Rhode Island]]. Burnham together with [[Charles Frederick Holder]], in 1908, made important archeological discoveries of [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] civilization in this region, including the [[Esperanza Stone]].<ref name="sciam" /><ref name="damned" /> He became a close business associate of Hammond and led a team of 500 men in guarding mining properties owned by Hammond, [[J.P. Morgan]], and the [[Guggenheim family|Guggenheims]] in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Sonora]].<ref name="nyt23apr1912" /> Just as the irrigation and mining projects were nearing completion in 1912, a long series of [[Mexican Revolution|Mexican revolutions]] began. The final blow to these efforts came in 1917 when Mexico passed laws prohibiting the sale of land to foreigners. Burnham and Hammond carried their properties until 1930 and then sold them to the Mexican government.<ref name="Hammond 1935, p565" />

}}

During [[World War I]], Burnham was living in California and was active in [[counterespionage]] for Britain.<ref name="rhodesianamar77" /> Much of it involved a famous Boer spy, Capt. [[Fritz Joubert Duquesne]], who became a German spy in both World Wars and claimed to have killed [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Field Marshal Kitchener]] while en route to meet with the Russians.<ref name="clementwood" /> During the Second Boer War, Burnham and Duquesne were each under orders to assassinate the other, but it was not until 1910 that the two men first met while both were in Washington, D.C., separately lobbying Congress to pass a bill in favor of the importation of African game animals into the United States (H.R. 23621).<ref name="chances p11<U+2013>23" /> Duquesne was twice arrested by the [[FBI]] and in 1942 he, along with the 32 other Nazi agents who made up the ''[[Duquesne Spy Ring]]'', was sent to prison for espionage in the largest spy ring conviction in U.S. history.{{sfn|FBI|2013}}

{{quote box

| quote = I know Burnham. He is a scout and a hunter of courage and ability, a man totally without fear, a sure shot, and a fighter. He is the ideal scout, and when enlisted in the military service of any country he is bound to be of the greatest benefit.
| source = <U+2014> President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], 1901.<ref name="Davis 1906" />
}}

During this period, Burnham was one of the eighteen officers selected by former U.S. president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to raise a [[Roosevelt's World War I volunteers|volunteer infantry division]] for service in France in 1917 shortly after the United States entered the war.<ref name="angloboerwar" /> A plan to raise volunteer soldiers from the Western U.S. came out of a meeting of the New York based [[Rocky Mountain Club]] and Burnham was put in charge of both the general organization and recruitment from the Southwest.<ref name="nty13mar1917" /> Congress gave Roosevelt the authority to raise up to four divisions similar to the [[Rough Riders]] of 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry Regiment and to the British Army [[25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers]]; however, as [[Commander-in-chief]], President [[Woodrow Wilson]] refused to make use of Roosevelt's volunteers and the unit disbanded.<ref name="foesofourownhousehold" /><ref name="nty20may, 1917" />

===Oil wealth===
Although Burnham had lived all over the world, he never had a great deal of wealth to show for his efforts. It was not until he returned to California, the place of his youth, that he struck it rich. In 1923, Burnham struck oil at Dominguez Hill, California. In the first 10 years of operation, the Burnham Exploration Company paid out $10.2 million in dividends.<ref name="Hammond 1935, p754" />

===Conservation===
An avid [[conservation movement|conservationist]] and [[hunter]], Burnham supported the early conservation programs of his friends Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot. He and his associate John Hayes Hammond led novel game expeditions to Africa with the goal of finding large animals such as [[Giant Eland]], [[hippopotamus]], [[zebra]], and various bird species that might be bred in the United States and become game for future American sportsmen. Burnham, Hammond, and Duquesne appeared several times before the [[House Committee on Agriculture]] to ask for help in importing large African animals.<ref name="nyt17apr1910" /><ref name="washpost3mar1911" /> In 1914, he helped establish the Wild Life Protective League of American, Department of Southern California, and served as its first Secretary.<ref name="cafishandgameapr1915" />

In his later years, Burnham filled various public offices and also served as a member of the [[Boone and Crockett Club]] of New York,<ref name="science21mar1930" /><ref name="latimes14may, 1929" /> and as a founding member of the American Committee for International Wildlife Protection (now a committee of the [[World Conservation Union]]).<ref name="science23may, 1930" /> He was a founding member of the [[Save-the-Redwoods League]], he helped lobby for and create the [[Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge]] and the [[Kofa National Wildlife Refuge]] for [[Desert Bighorn Sheep]] in Arizona, and he campaigned for state parks in California.<ref name="arizonahighways1941" /><ref name="coates" /> He was one of the original members of the first [[California Department of Parks and Recreation|California State Parks Commission]], serving from 1927 to 1934,<ref name="sierraclub" /> and late in his life he was president of the [[Southwest Museum]] of Los Angeles from 1938 until 1940.<ref name="frontierbiography" />

==Personal life==
At 5&nbsp;ft 4&nbsp;in (1.62&nbsp;m), Burnham was slight, but he was also muscular and bronzed, with a finely formed square jaw. He had a boyish appearance which he used to his advantage on numerous occasions. His most noticeable feature was his steady, grey-blue eyes. Contemporary reports had it that Burnham's gaze appeared to never leave those of the person he was looking at, and yet somehow could simultaneously monitor all the details of the physical surroundings. It was also said that Burnham's eyes possessed a far-away look such as those acquired by people whose occupation has caused them to watch continually at sea or on great plains.<ref name="Davis 1906" /><ref name="scouting" /><ref name="days" />

Burnham would not smoke and seldom drank alcohol, fearing these habits would injure the acuteness of his sense of smell. He found ways to train himself in mental patience, took [[power naps]] instead of indulging in periods of long sleep, and drank very little liquid. He trained himself to accept these abstinences in order to endure the most appalling fatigues, hunger, thirst, and wounds, so that when scouting or traveling where there was no water, he might still be able to exist. On more than one occasion he survived in environments where others would have died, or were in fact dying, of exhaustion. To him scouting was as exact a study as is the piano, and it was said that he could read the face of nature as easily as most could read their morning newspaper. He was quiet-mannered and courteous, according to contemporaries. Their reports describe a man who was neither shy nor self-conscious, who was extremely modest, and who seldom spoke of his many adventures.<ref name="Davis 1906" /><ref name="scouting" /><ref name="days" />

Burnham died when he was 86 on September 1, 1947 of heart failure at his home in [[Santa Barbara, California]]. At a private ceremony he was buried at Three Rivers, California, near his old cattle ranch, La Cuesta. His memorial stone was designed by his only surviving child, Roderick. Also buried at Three Rivers cemetery are his first wife, Blanche Blick Burnham, several members of the Blick family who had also pioneered in 19th century Rhodesia with Burnham for a time, his son Roderick, his granddaughter Martha Burnham Burleigh, and the Montana cowboy "Pete" Ingram who survived the Shangani Patrol massacre along with Burnham.<ref name="Kaweah" />

===Family===
[[File:Blanche blick burnham in africa 1896.jpg|thumb|upright|Blanche Blick Burnham in Bulawayo, Rhodesia, 1896]]

Burnham's wife of 55 years, Blanche Blick Burnham (February 25, 1862 <U+2013> December 22, 1939) of [[Nevada, Iowa]], accompanied him in very primitive conditions through many travels in both the Southwest United States and Southern Africa. Together they had three children, all of whom spent their early youth in Africa. In the early years, she watched over the children and the pack animals, always careful to keep a rifle within arms length. In the dark of night, she used her rifle many times against lions and [[hyena]] and, during the Siege of Bulawayo, against Ndebele warriors. Several members of the Blick family joined the Burnhams in Rhodesia, moved with them to England, and returned to the United States with the Burnhams to live near [[Three Rivers, California]]. When Burnham Exploration Company struck it rich in 1923, the Burnhams moved to a mansion in a new housing development then known as Hollywoodland (a name later shortened to "Hollywood") and took many trips around the world in high style. In 1939, Blanche suffered a stroke. She died a month later and was buried in the Three Rivers Cemetery.<ref name="familyletters" /><ref name="vanwyk" />

[[File:RodFly.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Rod Burnham, 1921]]

Burnham's first son, Roderick (August 22, 1886 <U+2013> July 2, 1976), was born in Pasadena, California, but accompanied the family to Africa and learned the [[Northern Ndebele language]].<ref name="latimes6jun1896" /> He went to Skagway, Alaska with his father, and then to a [[military school]] in France in 1900. In 1904, he attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], joined the football team, but left Berkeley after a dispute with his coach. In 1905<U+2013>08, he went to the [[University of Arizona]], joined the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity, played the position of [[running back]], and became the captain of the football team. He attended the Michigan School of Mines (now [[Michigan Technological University]]) in 1910, became a geologist, and worked for [[Union Oil]] as Manager of Lands and Foreign Exploration helping to develop the first wells in Mexico and [[Venezuela]].<ref name="latimes19jun1927" /> He took time off from his job to serve in the U.S. Army in World War I and fought in France.<ref name="vanwyk" /> He and his father became minority owners of the Burnham Exploration Company, incorporated in 1919 by Harris Hays Hammond (the son of John Hays Hammond, Sr). In 1930, he and [[Paramount Pictures]] founder [[W. W. Hodkinson]] started the Central American Aviation Corporation, the first airline in [[Guatemala]].<ref name="nytimes17jan1932" /><ref name="hodkinsonstandford" />

Nada (May 1894 <U+2013> May 19, 1896), Burnham's daughter who was the [[first white child]] born in Bulawayo, died of fever and starvation during the Siege of Bulawayo. She was buried three days later in the Pioneer Cemetery, plot No. 144, in Bulawayo, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). Nada is the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word for [[Agapanthus africanus|lily]] and she was named after the heroine in Sir [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s Zulu tale, ''Nada the Lily (1892)''. Three of Haggard's books are dedicated to Burnham's daughter, Nada: ''The Wizard'' (1896), ''Elissa: The Doom of Zimbabwe'' (1899), and ''Black Heart and White Heart: A Zulu Idyll'' (1900).<ref name="days" /><ref name="atlantaconstitution21nov1896" />

Burnham's youngest son, Bruce B. Burnham (1897<U+2013>1902), was staying with family in London when he accidentally drowned in the River [[Thames]].<ref name="rmontgomery" />

[[File:Howard burnham c1904.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Howard Burnham]], brother]]
His brother [[Howard Burnham|Howard]] (1870<U+2013>1918), born shortly before the family moved to Los Angeles, lost one leg at the age of 14 and suffered from [[tuberculosis]]. As a teen he lived with Fred in California and learned from his brother the art of Scoutcraft, how to shoot, and how to ride the range, all in spite of his wooden leg.<ref name="chances" /> Howard went to Africa and became a mining engineer in the gold mines of Johannesburg, South Africa and later wrote a text book on ''Modern Mine Valuation''.<ref name="howardburnham" /> He traveled the world and for a time teamed up with Fred on Yaqui River irrigation project in Mexico.<ref name="Hammond 1935, p565" /> During World War I, Howard worked as a spy for the French government, operating behind enemy lines in southwest Germany.<ref name="chances" /> Throughout the war he used his wooden leg to conceal tools he needed for spying.<ref name="chances" /> From his death bed, Howard returned to France via [[Switzerland]] and shared his vital data and secrets with the French government: the Germans were not opening a new front in the Alps and there was no need to move allied troops away from the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].<ref name="chances" /> Howard was buried at [[Cannes]], France, leaving behind his wife and four children.<ref name="chances" /> He had been named after his second cousin, LT [[Howard Mather Burnham]] who was killed in action in the [[American Civil War]].<ref name="scouting" />

His first cousin [[Charles Edward Russell]] (1860<U+2013>1941) was a journalist and politician and also a founder of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP). The author of a number of books of biography and social commentary Russell won a Pulitzer Prize in 1928 for his biography: ''The American Orchestra and [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]]''.

In 1943, at 83 years of age, Burnham married his young typist, Ilo K. Willetts Burnham (1914<U+2013>1958). The couple sold their mansion and moved to Santa Barbara in 1946.<ref name="vanwyk" /><ref name="yale" />

Burnham was a descendant of [[Thomas Burnham]] (1617<U+2013>1688) of [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the first American ancestor of a large number of Burnhams.<ref name="familyletters" /> The descendants of Thomas Burnham have been noted in every American war, including the [[French and Indian war]].<ref name="pressreflib" />

== Film and stage accounts ==
* In 1899, Frank E. Fillis brought his circus and stage show ''Savage South Africa'' along with Zulu performers to the Empress Theatre at Earls Courte, London, England, as part of the ''Greater Britain Exhibition.''  Twice-daily the actors dramatically played out famous battles from both Matabele wars.  One of the shows, ''Wilson's Heroic Stand at the Shangani River'' re-enacted the battle of the Shangani Patrol.{{sfn|The Times|1899|p=1}} Frank Fillis himself played the part of Major Alan Wilson, Peter Lobengula played the Matabele King Lobengula, and Burnham was played by the American [[Texas Jack (South Africa)|'Texas Jack' Jr.]], the adopted son of [[Texas Jack Omohundro]] and a man best remembered for running a [[Wild West show]] in South Africa where he gave [[Will Rogers]] his start as an entertainer.{{sfn|Barrett|Valiance|1999|p=125}} In September of that year, the re-enactment was filmed and sold to movie houses around the world as ''[[Major Wilson's Last Stand (film)|Major Wilson's Last Stand]].''{{sfn|MacKenzie|1986|p=97}}<ref>{{IMDb title|id=1991113|title=Major Wilson's Last Stand}}</ref>

* Burnham was portrayed by [[Will Hutchins]] in ''[[Shangani Patrol (film)|Shangani Patrol]]'' (1970), a feature film by David Millin.<ref name="imdb Shangani Patrol" /> Filmed on location in Bulawayo, [[Rhodesia]] by RPM Film Studios, 35&nbsp;mm copies of the film are now preserved by the National Film, Video and Sound Archives, Pretoria, South Africa.

* [[Ernest Hemingway]] acquired the rights to produce a film version of ''Scouting on Two Continents'' in late 1958. [[CBS]] immediately contracted Hemingway to produce the film for television, with [[Gary Cooper]] expressing an interest in playing the part of Burnham. Hemingway was already behind schedule in his other commitments and never started on the film when he committed suicide in July 1961.<ref name="hemingway" />

* ''On My Honor'', an epic film conceived and begun by [[Cecil B. DeMille]], was to document the founding of the Scouting movement but was left unfinished because of the legendary producer's untimely death in January 1959. In the screenplay started by [[Jesse Lasky, Jr.]], the film would have focused on Baden-Powell and the Scouting pioneers who were a major influence on Baden-Powell, including Burnham. Even after DeMille's death, associate producer [[Henry Wilcoxon]] continued to invest substantial work on the film until 1962, and [[Sydney Box]] was hired to assist with the script. Starting in 2001, producers [[Gerald R. Molen|Jerry Molen]] and Robert Starling began work to finish DeMille's project, including an updated screenplay by Starling based on the earlier work of Lasky and Box.{{sfn|Birchard|2004|p=372}}<ref name="ldsfilm" />

|quote= In my latest book [He-who-sees-in-the-dark] I have treated of Frederick Burnham, that famous American scout who was commissioned by the British Army to help them in their engagements with the Boers.  There is an especial significance for those of us in Scouting in this man's list, for he was engaged for this work by Lord Baden Powell, who was then connected with the British Army in Africa, and who had unbounded admiration for the scouting methods of Frederick Burnham.  So these two pioneers, each of whom was to have such immeasurable influence in restoring the old traditions of American youth, met in Africa, years before the Scouting movement was ever thought of.
