The '''Pe<U+0107>anac Chetniks''', also known as the '''Black Chetniks''' were a [[Chetnik]] [[Irregular military|irregular military force]] which operated in the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia]] under the leadership of [[vojvoda]] [[Kosta Pe<U+0107>anac]]. They were loyal to the [[Government of National Salvation|German-backed Serbian puppet government]] and fought against [[Yugoslav Partisans]] and the Chetniks of [[Dra<U+017E>a Mihailovi<U+0107>]].

==Background==
[[Kosta Pe<U+0107>anac]] was the most prominent figure in the [[Chetniks|Chetnik]] movement during the [[interwar period]]. He had a leading role in the [[Association against Bulgarian Bandits]], a notorious organisation that arbitrarily terrorised Bulgarians in the [[<U+0160>tip]] region.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=47}} He also served as a commander with the [[Organization of Yugoslav Nationalists]] (ORJUNA).{{sfn|Newman|2012|p=158}} He was present as a member of parliament at the assassination of [[Croatian Peasant Party]] (HSS) leader [[Stjepan Radi<U+0107>]] and HSS deputies Pavle Radi<U+0107> and [[<U+0110>uro Basari<U+010D>ek]] on 20 June 1928. Prior to the shooting, he was accused by HSS deputy [[Ivan Pernar]] of being responsible for a massacre of 200 Muslims in 1921.{{sfn|Glenny|2012|p=410}}

Pe<U+0107>anac became the president of the Chetnik Association in 1932.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=126}} By opening membership of the Chetnik Association to new younger members that had not served in World War I, he grew the organisation during the 1930s from a nationalist veterans' association focused on protecting veterans' rights to an aggressively partisan Serb political organisation with 500,000 members throughout the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Singleton|1985|p=188}} During this period, Pe<U+0107>anac formed close ties with the far-right [[Yugoslav Radical Union]] government of [[Milan Stojadinovi<U+0107>]],{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=52}} and was known for his hostility to the [[Yugoslav Communist Party]], which made him popular with conservatives such as those in the Yugoslav Radical Union.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=19}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=120}}

==Formation==
Shortly before the Axis invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Pe<U+0107>anac was requested by the [[Ministry of Defense (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav Ministry of the Army and Navy]] to prepare for guerrilla operations and guard the southern area of Serbia, Macedonia, and Kosovo from pro-Bulgarians and pro-Albanians in the region. He was given arms and money, and managed to arm several hundred men in the [[Toplica (river)|Toplica River]] valley in southern Serbia. Pe<U+0107>anac's force remained intact after the German occupation of Serbia and supplemented its strength from Serb refugees fleeing Macedonia and Kosovo. In the early summer of 1941, Pe<U+0107>anac's detachments fought against Albanian bands.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=126}} At this time and for a considerable time after, only detachments under Pe<U+0107>anac were identified by the term  "Chetnik".{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=127}} With the formation of the communist [[Yugoslav Partisans]], Pe<U+0107>anac gave up any interest in resistance, and by late August came to agreements with both the Serbian puppet government and the German authorities to carry out attacks against the Partisans.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=127}}{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=21}}

Pe<U+0107>anac kept the organizational structure of his detachments simple. All of the commanders were selected personally by Pe<U+0107>anac and consisted of former officers, peasants, Orthodox priests, teachers, and merchants.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=127}} The Pe<U+0107>anac Chetniks were also known as the "Black Chetniks".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=59}}

==Collaboration==
On 18 August 1941, while he was concluding arrangements with the Germans, Pe<U+0107>anac received a letter from [[Dra<U+017E>a Mihailovi<U+0107>]] requesting an agreement be reached where Pe<U+0107>anac would control the Chetniks south of the [[West Morava|Western Morava River]] while Mihailovi<U+0107> would control the Chetniks in all other areas.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=127<U+2013>128}} Pe<U+0107>anac declined his request and suggested that he might offer Mihailovi<U+0107> the [[chief of staff]] position and recommended Mihailovi<U+0107>'s detachments disband and join his detachments. In the meantime, Pe<U+0107>anac had arranged for the transfer of several thousand of his Chetniks to the Serbian Gendarmerie to act as German auxiliaries.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=183}}
[[File:Proclamation issued by Kosta Pecanac.jpg|thumb|alt=a copy of the proclamation by Pe<U+0107>anac|Pe<U+0107>anac's "Proclamation to the Dear People"]]
On 27 August, Pe<U+0107>anac issued an open "Proclamation to the Dear People", in which he portrayed himself as the defender and protector of Serbs and called "on detachments that have been formed without his approval" to come together under his command. He demanded that individuals hiding in the forests return to their homes immediately and that acts of sabotage on occupation authorities cease or suffer the punishment of death.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=128}}

In September 1941, some of Pe<U+0107>anac's subordinates broke ranks to join with the Partisans in fighting the Germans and their Serbian auxiliaries. In the Kopoanik region, a previously loyal subordinate of Pe<U+0107>anac began attacking local gendarmerie stations and clashing with armed bands of Albanian Muslims. By the end of October the Germans decided to stop arming the "unreliable" elements within Pe<U+0107>anac's Chetniks, and attached the remainder to their other Serbian auxiliary forces.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=28<U+2013>29}}

On 7 October 1941, Pe<U+0107>anac sent a request to the head of the [[Government of National Salvation|Serbian puppet government]], [[Milan Nedi<U+0107>]] for stronger organization, supplies, arms, salary funds, and more. Over time his requests were fulfilled and a German [[liaison officer]] was appointed at Pe<U+0107>anac's headquarters to help coordinate actions. On 17 January 1942, according to German data, 72 Chetnik officers and 7,963 men were being provided for by the Serbian [[Gendarmerie]] Command. This fell short of the maximum authorized size of 8,745 men and included two or three thousand of Mihailovi<U+0107>'s Chetniks who were legalized in November 1941.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=127}} In the same month, Pe<U+0107>anac sought permission from the Italians for his forces to move into eastern [[Italian governorate of Montenegro|Montenegro]], but was refused over Italian concerns that the Chetniks would move into the [[Sand<U+017E>ak]].{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=44<U+2013>45}}

In April 1942, the German Commanding General in Serbia, ''General der Artillerie'' (General) [[Paul Bader]], issued orders giving unit numbers C{{ndash}}39 to C{{ndash}}101 to the Pe<U+0107>anac Chetnik detachments, which were put under the command of the local German division or area command post. These orders also required the deployment of a German liaison officer with all detachments engaged in operations, and limited their movement outside their assigned area. Supply of arms and ammunition was also controlled.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=195}} In July 1942, Mihailovi<U+0107> arranged for the Yugoslav government-in-exile to denounce Pe<U+0107>anac as a traitor,{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=63}} and his continuing collaboration ruined what remained of the reputation he had developed in the Balkan Wars and World War I.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=59}}

==Dissolution==
The Germans soon found that Pe<U+0107>anac's units were inefficient, unreliable, and of little military aid to them. Pe<U+0107>anac's Chetniks regularly clashed and had rivalries with other German auxiliaries such as the [[Serbian State Guard]] and [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Command]] and also with Mihailovi<U+0107>'s Chetniks.{{sfn|Lazi<U+0107>|2011|pp=29<U+2013>30}} The Germans and the puppet government commenced disbanding them in September 1942, and all but one was dissolved by the end of 1942. The last detachment was dissolved in March 1943. His followers were dispersed to other German auxiliary forces, German labour units, and prisoner-of-war camps. Many deserted to join Mihailovi<U+0107>. Nothing is known of Pe<U+0107>anac's activities in the months that followed except that he was interned for some time by the Serbian puppet government.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=128, 195}}
Accounts of Pe<U+0107>anac's capture and death vary. According to one account, Pe<U+0107>anac, four of his leaders and 40 of their followers were captured by forces loyal to Mihailovi<U+0107> in February 1944. All were killed within days except Pe<U+0107>anac, who remained in custody to write his war memoirs before being executed on 5 May 1944.{{sfn|Lazi<U+0107>|2011|pp=29<U+2013>30}} Another source states he was assassinated on 6 June 1944 by Chetniks loyal to Mihailovi<U+0107>.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=260}}
