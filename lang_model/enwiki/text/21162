The '''Governor of Indiana''' is the chief [[executive officer]] of the government of [[Indiana]]. Elected to a four year term, the Governor is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day management of the functions of many of state government agencies and shares power in other agencies with publicly elected state cabinet heads. He or she works out of the [[Indiana Statehouse]] in [[Indianapolis]] and holds official functions at the [[Indiana Governor's Residence]]. [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[Mitch Daniels]] currently serves as the 49th Governor.

The position of governor has developed over the course of two centuries. It has became considerably more powerful since the mid-20th century after decades of struggle with the [[Indiana General Assembly]] and [[Indiana Supreme Court]] to establish the executive branch of the government as an equal third branch of the state government. Although gubernatorial powers were again significantly expanded by constitutional amendments during the 1970s, Indiana governors remain significantly less powerful than their counterparts in most other US states.

==Office==
===Authority===
The Governor of Indiana has wide-ranging executive authority to manage the government of the state and is the chief executive of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] of the state government. These powers are established in the [[Constitution of Indiana]].<ref name = a5>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.indiana.edu/uslawdocs/inconst/art-5.html|title=Constitution of Indiana, Article Five|publisher=[[Indiana University]]|accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref><ref name = ic10/> The Governor works in concert with the [[Indiana General Assembly]] and the [[Supreme Court of Indiana]] to govern the state. As an independent branch, the governor has the ability to balance the other branches. Among these abilities is the power to veto legislation passed by the General Assembly. If vetoed, a bill is returned to the General Assembly for reconsideration, where they may override the veto with only a simple majority vote. One of the Governor's most important political powers is the ability to call a special session of the [[Indiana General Assembly|General Assembly]]. During a two-year period, the assembly can meet on its own for no more than 91 days, and this often prevents them from passing all the legislation they intend to. This can give the Governor considerable influence in the body which will often compromise on issues with him in exchange for a special legislative session.<ref name = a5/><ref name = ic10/>

[[File:StateCapitolIndiana.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Indiana Statehouse]] where the governor's office is located]]

Among his other powers, the Governor can call out the [[Indiana Guard Reserve|state defense force]] or the [[Indiana National Guard]] in times of emergency or disaster. The Governor is also charged with the enforcement of all the state's laws and the [[Indiana Code]] through the [[Indiana State Police]]. The Governor also has the ability to pardon or commute the sentence of any criminal offenders who have been convicted by the state's judicial system, except in cases of treason or impeachment.<ref name = a5/>

In addition to constitutional powers, governors also have a considerable degree of statutory authority. Most of the authority exercised by governors on a daily basis are derived from statutes, giving the General Assembly a great degree of control over him through their power to alter statutes.<ref>Indiana Chamber, p. 11</ref> The Governor also can influence the courts by using his appointment power. The [[Indiana Judicial Nominating Commission|Judicial Nominating Commission]] creates a list of three candidates from which the Governor chooses one who will serve on the state-level courts. This allows him to choose the appointments to the Supreme Court, the circuit courts, and the Tax Court. He can also fill vacancies after the death or resignation of [[Justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] or members of the superior courts; his appointees can hold the office until the next general election when their successor is chosen by the public. The authority to make such appointments gives the Governor considerable sway in setting the makeup of the judiciary.<ref name = a5/>

The annual salary of the Governor of Indiana is $95,000. Additionally, he receives $6,000 annually for discretionary spending and expenses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title4/ar2/ch1.html|title=Information Maintained by the Office of Code Revision Indiana Legislative Services Agency|date=2008-11-22 |publisher=State of Indiana|accessdate=2008-11-23}}</ref><ref>Indiana Chamber, p. 13</ref>

===Requirements===
To become Governor of Indiana, a candidate must have been a [[United States nationality law|United States citizen]] and lived within Indiana for the period of five consecutive years before the election. The candidate must also be at least 30 years old when sworn into office. The Governor may not hold any other state or federal office during his term and must resign from any such position before being eligible to be sworn in as Governor. Before taking the office, the candidate must swear an [[oath of office]] administered by the [[List of Indiana Supreme Court Justices|Chief Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of Indiana]], promising to uphold the Constitution and laws of Indiana.<ref name = a5/>

===Term limits===
Once elected, a Governor serves a four-year term beginning on the date he is sworn into office; inauguration day is the second Monday in January. He remains Governor until his successor takes the oath office. The Governor's term can be shorter if he resigns, dies, become incapacitated or impeached. There is no limit to how many terms a Governor may serve; however, the Governor is limited to being elected to two consecutive terms at a time and may remain in office a maximum of eight years in any twelve year period. To be eligible to run for a third term, the Governor would have to sit out for one election period.<ref name = a5/><ref name = ic10>Indiana Chamber, p 10</ref>

===Succession===

If the Governor becomes incapacitated, then the [[Lieutenant Governor of Indiana]] becomes acting-Governor until his recovery. Only two governors have became incapacitated during their terms, and current precedent is that the governor's office is to notify the Lieutenant Governor, who will then make the decision to become acting-governor by notifying the General Assembly by letter. The Governor can resume his office by sending a letter to the General Assembly notifying them that he is again capable of executing the duties of office. If the Governor resigns, dies, or is impeached, tried, and convicted, then the Lieutenant Governor becomes Governor. If the office of the Lieutenant Governor is vacant, then the Senate Pro-Tempore becomes Governor. If the office of Senate President pro tempore is also vacant, then the Senate must elect a new Pro-Tempore to fill the Governor's office.<ref name = a5/>

===Residence and offices===
{{see also|Indiana Governor's Residence|Indiana Statehouse}}

The Governor maintains an office of the first floor of the [[Indiana Statehouse]] in [[Indianapolis]], and from there he manages all the of state's agencies that are under his jurisdiction. He shares the building with the Indiana General Assembly and the Supreme Court of Indiana.  The other elected executive officers, including the [[Indiana Attorney General|Attorney General]] and the Lieutenant Governor, are also located in the statehouse, but most of the state's bureaus are located in the state office building. Traditionally, the Governor lives in the [[Indiana Governor's Residence]], also located in Indianapolis; however, the Daniels family maintains their private home, using the Governor's Residence only for official functions.

===Governors===

{{see also|List of Governors of Indiana}}

The first Governor of Indiana, [[Jonathan Jennings]], was elected in August 1816 and assumed office in December of that year. The first capital was in [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]], and the first three governors maintained homes and offices there. The capital was moved to Indianapolis in December 1824. Governors originally served three-years terms until the constitution was replaced in 1851. The 1851 constitution extended terms to four years but banned governors from serving consecutive terms. The constitution was amended again in 1972 to allow governors to serve consecutive terms but limited them to two consecutive terms at a time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.indiana.edu/uslawdocs/inconst.txt|title=CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF INDIANA|publisher=Indiana University School of Law&nbsp;<U+2014> Bloomington|accessdate=2008-12-07}}</ref>

There have been 49 Governors of Indiana. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] have each held the position 21 times. Four have died while in office; seven have resigned. Ten Lieutenant Governors have succeeded to become Governor. [[James B. Ray]] has been the only President of the Senate ''pro tempore'' to assume the office of Governor.

Jonathan Jennings was the first Governor to have an attempted impeachment brought against him in response to his actions as an agent of the federal government during the negotiations of the [[Treaty of St. Mary's]] in 1819, illegal under Indiana's constitution. The evidence of his role was destroyed, and after two months of investigation the proceedings were dropped.<ref>Woollen, p. 37</ref> The only other time was when the General Assembly attempted to bring impeachment proceedings against Governor [[James B. Ray]] for a similar action in 1826, but the action was also defeated 28<U+2013>30.<ref>Woolen, p. 61</ref>

===Power shifts===
Historically, the office of Indiana's governor has been a weaker institution than the other branches of state government when compared to that of other U.S. States.<ref name = g1n2/> During Indiana's territorial period, there was a considerable resentment to the power wielded by the territorial governors, and in response the anti-governor faction, which dominated the constitutional convention, created a weak executive position. The governor was not given complete authority over the militia, his term was set at three years, and most of his actions could be overridden by the General Assembly.<ref name = g1n2/> The position was steadily weakened by the legislature, and his power was limited further by the constitution of 1851. The governor's authority to choose his own appointments for the state courts was removed, and the ability to appoint his own cabinet was ended. The cabinet was effectively made independent by making them elected popularly. The authority to propose budgets was revoked, and serving consecutive terms was banned. By comparison, the Supreme Court was made almost entirely independent, and the General Assembly assumed many of the powers taken from the governor.<ref name = g1n2>Gugin, pp. 1<U+2013>2</ref>

[[File:Oliver Hazard Perry Morton - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|right|Governor of [[Indiana during the American Civil War]], [[Oliver P. Morton]]]]

Governors first began to assert their own power during the [[American Civil War]] as the General Assembly attempted to remove command of the militia from the governor.<ref name = g3/> In response, the [[Indiana in the American Civil War|General Assembly was effectively suppressed]], during which time the governor assumed many powers to appoint public officials, hire and remove state employees, and manage state finances. When the General Assembly reconvened with a majority sympathetic to the governor, he was permitted to continue many of his assumed powers.<ref name = g3/> In 1889, the General Assembly began to reassert its authority over hiring state employees. The issued ended when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the legislature, again returning to it final authority over hiring state employees. The legislature passed acts in 1895 that removed the last of the governor's authority to appoint anyone to executive positions.<ref name = g3>Gugin, p. 3</ref>

With the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s, the governors again began to reassert authority. The Executive Reorganization Act was passed, returning the governor to a considerable level of appointment power. New state welfare and regulatory agencies were placed directly under the governor's control, greatly expanding his role in running the state and creating a large number of [[patronage]] positions.<ref name = g3/> The legislature responded by trying to create a [[merit system]] for public offices, but it was largely unable to effectively enforce it given the new scope of government agencies.<ref name = g4/> The battle with the governor continued until 1941, when the legislature rescinded the Executive Reorganization Act and replaced it with the State Administration Act, which placed most of the government under the control of elected commissioners and reduced the governor's practical executive authority to commander of the militia and the executor of legislation. The matter was taken to the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Tucker v. State of Indiana]]''. The court ruled for the first time that the governor was in fact the Chief Executive of the state, and that the legislature could pass no law that infringed upon that right. The decision was a major shift from previous court decisions and granted governors a legal basis to resist future encroachment on their powers.<ref name = g4/>

During the 1970s, a series of amendments was passed under popular governors that also increased their powers. The state courts were again made appointive, but selection of the candidates was granted to the court-dominated [[Indiana Judicial Nominating Commission]]. However, the governor was given more control over the process in which he previously had none. Another amendment removed the ban on consecutive terms, allowing Indiana's first consecutive term governors in over one-hundred years.<ref name = g4>Gugin, p. 4</ref> A third amendment granted the power to prepare a budget to a State Budgetary Agency, which was run by officials appointed by the governor. The significant authority this gave the governor over the budget was the "greatest transfer of power" to the governor yet, according to historian and professor of political science Linda Gugin.<ref name = g5>Gugin, p. 5</ref>

Despite gaining considerable power during the mid twentieth-century, the governor is still much weaker than those of other states. He has no [[line-item veto]] authority, and the [[pocket-veto]] was ruled unconstitutional. If a governor does not sign or reject a bill, it becomes law automatically.<ref name = g5/> This led the to a first fight during the term of [[Claude Matthews]], who was locked out of the House chambers to prevent him from returning a bill in time.<ref>Gugin, p. 207</ref> Vetoes are also easily overridden, requiring only a simple majority as opposed to a [[super majority]]. The legislature still exercises final control over the hiring of state employees, but given the large size of the government and the short legislative sessions, they are unable to make any considerable impact other than their continued advocacy for an expanded merit system. The cabinet is still almost entirely independent of the governor, and he has control over only half of the government's agencies, such as the [[Indiana State Police]] and the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Other large agencies, such as the Department of Administration, are under the control of the cabinet.<ref name="Gugin, p. 6">Gugin, p. 6</ref>

===Veto usage===

During the state's early history, vetoes were seldom employed by governors primarily because they were seen as only symbolic since the General Assembly could override them with only a simple majority.<ref name="Gugin, p. 6"/> Governor [[James Whitcomb]] was the first to make significant use of the power and vetoed a record of fifteen bills during a single legislative session.<ref name="Gugin, p. 6"/> [[Roger Branigin]], who presided over a hostile legislature, made the most total vetoes of any governor, returning a total of one-hundred bills to the assembly.<ref name="Gugin, p. 6"/> Despite the fact that vetoes are easily overridden, only around ten percent of vetoed bills are overridden. During the 1970s, for example, 117 bills were vetoed, but only eleven were overridden.<ref name="Gugin, p. 6"/> Observers and historians attribute this to the short length of legislative sessions, which often do not allow enough time for a large number of bills to pass through both houses twice. Another factor is that legislators of the same party as the governor typically refuse to override his veto, even in cases where they supported the bill originally.<ref name="Gugin, p. 6"/>

===General Assembly relations===

[[File:Joseph A Wright Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Governor [[Joseph A. Wright]] had a bitter fight with the [[Indiana General Assembly|General Assembly]] over the [[Bank of Indiana]].]]

The governor's relationship with the General Assembly has typically been the determining factor in his success at enacting his agenda, although other factors also play an important role. In most of Indiana's history, the governor has come to power at a time in which his party controlled the assembly.<ref>Gugin, p. 7</ref> Since the political parties first became dominant in 1831 and until 2006, thirty-one sessions of the legislature have been divided with different parties controlling the House and Senate. Only five sessions have occurred where the legislature was entirely controlled by the opposition party, while in ninety-eight sessions the governor's party controlled the entire assembly.<ref>Gugin, p. 8</ref>

Governors who had previously been legislators have generally had greater success in achieving their legislative goals while governor. Three speakers of the house have became governor.<ref name = g10/> Governor [[Joseph Wright]] had the worst relations of any governor with the assembly. He twice delivered speeches to a joint session were he harangued them for what he perceived to be corruption, accusing them of taking bribes from the [[Bank of Indiana]]. The legislature responded by overriding all his anti-banking vetoes. He was so disliked by his own party that he was expelled from it after his term.<ref name = g10>Gugin, p. 10</ref>

===Traits===

Except for James Whitcomb, all of Indiana's governors have been married at the time of their election. Whitcomb married while in office.<ref>Gugin, p. 29</ref> About half of the governors have been married multiple times, all due the death of their first wives. Three governors' wives, including Whitcomb's, died while their husbands were in office. Except for Jonathan Jennings, all of the state governors have also had children.<ref name = g11>Gugin, p. 11</ref> Only twenty of Indiana's governors were native to the state. Seven were born in [[Pennsylvania]], four born in [[Ohio]], and four born in [[Kentucky]]. Other governors have come from [[Michigan]], [[Virginia]], [[New York]], and [[Vermont]].<ref name = g15>Gugin, p. 15</ref>

Territorial Governor [[William Henry Harrison]] was appointed to office at age twenty-seven, making him the youngest executive. James B. Ray, elevated at thirty-one and reelected at thrity-two, was the youngest governor to be elected to office. [[Evan Bayh]], at age thirty-four, is the only other governor under the age of forty to be elected. [[James D. Williams]], at age sixty-nine, was oldest governor to be elected and died in office at age seventy-two. The average age of governors at the time of their election is fifty.<ref name = g11/>

Thirty-two of Indiana's governors have served in the military. Veteran organizations have served as a gateway for the governorship. [[Ira J. Chase]] served as leader of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. Paul V. McNutt, [[Ralph F. Gates]], [[George N. Craig]] were leaders of the [[American Legion]], whose national headquarters is in Indianapolis.<ref name = g11/>  Thirty governors have been lawyers by profession, and three have been farmers. Thirty received a college education, with eleven of them having attended [[Indiana University]]. Several governors have went on to higher office, with nine serving in the [[United States Senate]], and two serving as [[Vice President of the United States]].<ref name = g11/>
