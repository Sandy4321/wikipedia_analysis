"'''Wake Me Up'''" is a song by Swedish [[disc jockey|DJ]] and music producer [[Avicii]]. American [[soul music|soul]] singer [[Aloe Blacc]] provides vocals for the track<ref name="Daily Star">[http://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/playlist/329455/Aloe-Blacc-saves-day-for-Avicii Aloe Blacc saves day for Avicii Daily Star<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5800783/aloe-blacc-on-having-an-anonymous-hit-with-wake-me-up-i-like-the-discovery|title=Aloe Blacc on Having an Anonymous Hit With 'Wake Me Up!': 'I Like the Discovery'|last=Rutherford|first=Kevin|author2=Caulfield, Keith |date=25 November 2013|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref> and [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]]' [[Mike Einziger]] provides acoustic guitar. It was released on 17 June 2013 by PRMD Music and [[Island Records|Universal Island]] as the first single from Avicii's full-length debut studio album, ''[[True (Avicii album)|True]]'' (2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/code/1567857/avicii-to-release-debut-album-true-in-september-exclusive|title=Avicii to Release Debut Album '#TRUE' in September: Exclusive|last=Schulma|first=Jacob|date=20 June 2013|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref>

Avicii introduced "Wake Me Up!" for the first time live on stage at the [[Ultra Music Festival]] in Miami.

"Wake Me Up" peaked at number one in much of Europe and charted well in all of the English-speaking world. The song has been described as a "summer anthem"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.variancemagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1219:listen-avicii-a-aloe-blaccs-wake-me-up&catid=5:music&Itemid=80 |title=LISTEN: Avicii and Aloe Blacc's Wake Me Up}}</ref> by Variance Magazine and, throughout the 2013 festival season, Avicii included it as part of the opening or closing sequence of his sets at EDC Las Vegas, EDC London, [[Tomorrowland (festival)|Tomorrowland]], [[Creamfields]], [[Electric Zoo]] and the [[iTunes Festival]].<ref>[http://www.1001tracklists.com/dj/avicii/index.html Avicii Tracklists / Playlists Overview - 1001 Tracklists<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Due to the high success of the song, Blacc later released an acoustic version of "Wake Me Up" in his solo EP ''[[Wake Me Up (EP)|Wake Me Up]]''. It was also released as a promotional stand-alone single on [[Interscope Records]], made available online for downloads via [[iTunes]]. A separate music video was also made. The Blacc single also charted in its right in various charts.

==Background==
In an interview with the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'', Avicii, who had previously labelled "Wake Me Up!" as "a fun experiment" during an exclusive chat with [[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV UK]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/news/avicii/387333-avicii-aloe-black-wrote-wake-me-up-lyrics-in-two-hours|title=Avicii: 'Aloe Blacc Wrote Wake Me Up Lyrics In Two Hours'|date=30 July 2013|publisher=[[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV UK]]|accessdate=10 September 2013}}</ref> said: "I had a demo with [[Mac Davis]] singing, the guy who wrote all the [[Elvis Presley]] stuff, but I needed another singer to do the parts. At the same time I was tipped off about doing another track with [[Aloe Blacc]], and I started working on that track. When I was with [[Mike Einziger]] from [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], we came up with the chord progression and the melody for 'Wake Me Up!' but no real lyrics. None of us sing and we really needed to get that demo down and the only person I knew that lived in [[Los Angeles|LA]] was Aloe, so I called him and he was free. Lyrics come really easy to him so he wrote them in a couple of hours and we finished the track."<ref name="Daily Star" /><ref>{{cite web|url = http://nextshark.com/the-voice-behind-aviciis-wake-me-up-talks-unconventional-success-interview/|title = The Voice Behind Avicii<U+2019>s <U+2018>Wake Me Up<U+2019> Talks Unconventional Success [INTERVIEW]|author = Benny Luo|publisher = NextShark|date = 6 November 2013}}</ref>

Aloe Blacc who is not credited on the track explained to ''[[The Huffington Post]]'': "I started writing the lyrics at the top of 2013, travelling back from Switzerland. I started in hip hop music back in the 90s and I never expected to be singing and have an actual career as a musician but I'm travelling all over the world and I thought 'Life is a dream, wake me up when it's all over'. I was invited to the studio with Avicii and Mike Einziger from Incubus and when I got to the studio, they had already come up with a chord progression of the song. I came in with the lyrics and I just developed the melody as I heard the chords, and we all thought it was something very strong. We finished the song that night as an acoustic version, then Avicii made the dance mix in a couple of days, and that's what we released to the world, and that was his release."

Blacc, later released an acoustic version<ref>{{cite web|last1=Katz|first1=emily Tess|title=Aloe Blacc Explains Why He Didn't Receive Billing For Avicii's Hit 'Wake Me Up'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/31/aloe-blacc-wake-me-up_n_5638987.html|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=3 August 2014|date=31 July 2014}}</ref> of the song in his solo EP ''[[Wake Me Up (EP)|Wake Me Up]]''. It was also released as a promotional stand-alone single on [[Interscope Records]] and made available online for downloads via [[iTunes]]. The Blacc single also charted in its right in various charts.

==Critical reception==
Robert Copsey of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' gave the song a positive review, stating:
<blockquote>
"As chart-friendly [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] continues to reach the furthest corners of the globe, staying ahead of the pack can prove a tricky task - especially when more and more acts arrive on the scene turning out mixes with identikit build-ups, tired lyrics and uninspired breakdowns that newcomers to the arena lap up with excitement. Kudos to Avicii then, who has dared to try something a little different for his latest offering. "So wake me up when it's all over/ When I'm wiser and I'm older," featured artist Aloe Blacc sings over dialled-up, country-flecked guitar strums that sound like [[Mumford & Sons]] on speed. The jig-along chorus may conjure up images of Brits-on-tour, but to be honest, what summer anthem doesn't?" {{rating|4|5}}.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a498459/avicii-wake-me-up-single-review.html Avicii: 'Wake Me Up' - Single review]. digitalspy.co.uk/ [[Digital Spy]].</ref>
</blockquote>
Wake Me Up is written in the key of B Minor. It follows the chord progression of Bm-G-D-A and has a tempo of 124 bpm.
