The '''''Mana''''' series, known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Seiken Densetsu'''''|<U+8056><U+5263><U+4F1D><U+8AAC>|extra=lit. "Holy Sword Legend"}}, is a [[console role-playing game]] series from [[Square Enix]], created by [[Koichi Ishii]]. The series began as a handheld [[side story]] to Square's [[flagship]] franchise ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', although most ''Final Fantasy''-inspired elements were subsequently dropped, starting with the second installment, ''[[Secret of Mana]]''. It has since grown to include games of various genres within the [[fictional universe|fictional world]] of Mana, with recurring stories involving a [[world tree]], its associated holy sword, and the fight against forces that would steal their power.
Several character designs, creatures, and musical themes reappear frequently.

In 2003, the series comprised five games; since 2006, it has experienced a revival through the ''World of Mana'' campaign, with five new games released in the span of one year. As of [[2008 in video gaming|2008]], the ''Mana'' series comprises eight console games and two mobile games, in addition to four manga and one novelization. The ''Mana'' series reception has been very uneven, with  ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' earning wide acclaim, such as being rated 78th in [[IGN]]'s yearly "Top 100 Games of All Time", and being highly praised for its musical score, while the games from the ''World of Mana'' series have been rated considerably lower.

===History===
[[Image:Emergence of Excalibur.png|thumb|left|The logo of ''Seiken Densetsu: The Emergence of Excalibur'']]
Square trademarked the title ''Seiken Densetsu: The Emergence of Excalibur'' in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]], intending to use it for a game project led by [[Kazuhiko Aoki]] for the [[Famicom Disk System]]. According to early advertisements, the game would consist of an unprecedented five [[floppy disk]]s, making it one of the largest titles developed for the Famicom up until that point. Although Square solicited [[pre-order]]s for the game, [[Kaoru Moriyama]], a former Square employee, affirms that management canceled the ambitious project before it advanced beyond the early planning stages. In October 1987, customers who had placed orders were sent a letter informing them of the cancellation and had their purchases refunded. The letter also suggested to consider placing an order on another upcoming Square role-playing game in a similar vein: ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name="lostlevels">{{cite web| url=http://www.lostlevels.org/200311/200311-square.shtml| title=Elusions: Final Fantasy IV / Seiken Densetsu| accessdate=2007-06-09| author=Collette, Chris| date=2003-11-15| publisher=Lost Levels}}</ref>

In [[1991 in video gaming|1991]], Square reused the ''Seiken Densetsu'' trademark for an unrelated [[Game Boy]] [[action role-playing game]] directed by [[Koichi Ishii]]. Originally developed under the title ''Gemma Knights'', the game was renamed ''Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden'' (published in [[North America]] as ''[[Final Fantasy Adventure]]'' and in [[Europe]] as ''Mystic Quest'').<ref name="lostlevels"/> Beginning with ''[[Secret of Mana]]'', Seiken Densetsu was subsequently "spun off" into its own series of action role-playing games distinct from ''Final Fantasy'', with four titles released between [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] and [[2003 in video gaming|2003]].<ref>{{cite web| author= Basire, Casey| url=http://nintendoworldreport.com/previewArt.cfm?artid=14006| title=The World of Mana series is returning, real-time strategy style.| accessdate=2008-02-15| date=2007-07-14| publisher=[[Nintendo World Report]]}}</ref> The ''[[Legend of Mana]]'' was made 2D because the [[PlayStation]] could not handle the full 3D world he envisioned where one could interact with natural shaped objects.<ref name= "loop">{{cite web | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/656/656191p1.html| title=HAVOK For Mana| accessdate=2008-06-15| author=Gantayat, Anoop| date=2006-10-06| publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref> In [[2005 in video gaming|2005]], Square Enix announced plans for ''World of Mana'', a new series of titles in the ''Mana'' franchise, whose titles would span more [[video game genres|video game genre]]s than the original series. Koichi Ishii decided even before he worked on ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' about creating new ''Mana'' games, but first wanted to create a goal for the new series, and eventually decided to make it about exploring how to add "the feeling of touch" to a game. After he saw the game ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' at [[E3]] in 2003, he felt that its physics engine was the one he needed.<ref name= "loop"/> As of February [[2008 in video gaming|2008]], ''World of Mana'' comprises five games and one manga, with the possibility of a [[Wii]] game under discussion.<ref name="RPGamer">{{cite web| url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/sd/sdproject/sdprojectinterview.html| title=Children of Mana Interview| accessdate=2007-06-09| author=RPGamer staff| date=2006-10-06| publisher=[[RPGamer]]}}</ref> Koichi Ishii has served as director or producer for all ''Mana'' games.

===Creation and design===
[[Image:Worldofmanalogo.jpg|thumb|The logo of the ''World of Mana'' series]]
The ''Mana'' series is the result of Koichi Ishii's desire to create a fictional world. In Ishii's opinion, ''Mana'' is not a series of video games, but rather a world which is illustrated by and can be explored through video games.<ref name="JeuxFrance">{{cite web| url=http://www.jeux-france.com/articles_dossiers304_interview-children-of-mana.html| title=Interview Children of Mana| accessdate=2007-06-15| author=Morcos, Antoine| date=2006-12-15 | work=JeuxFrance.com| publisher=Press<U+00C9>lite| language=French}}</ref> When working on the series, Koichi Ishii draws inspiration, from abstract images from his memories of childhood, as well as movies and [[fantasy]] books that captivated him as a child. Ishii takes care to avoid set conventions, and his influences are correspondingly very wide and non-specific. Nonetheless, among his literary influences, he acknowledges [[Tove Jansson]]'s ''[[Moomin]]'', [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name="RPGamer">{{cite web| url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/sd/sdproject/sdprojectinterview.html| title=Children of Mana Interview| accessdate=2007-06-09| author=RPGamer staff| date=2006-10-06| publisher=[[RPGamer]]}}</ref>

While some titles of the ''World of Mana'' series do share direct connections with other installments, the games of the series have few concrete links.<ref name="1Up timeline">{{cite web| url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3158532| title=Heroes of Mana Preview| accessdate=2007-06-15| author=Parish, Jeremy| date=2007-04-05| work=[[1UP.com]]| publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref> There is no overall explicit in-game chronological order. Further, according to Koichi Ishii the games do not take place in exactly the same world, and characters or elements who appear in different titles are best considered alternate versions of each other. Instead, the connections between each title are more abstract than story-based, linked only on the [[karma|karmic]] level.<ref name="RPGamer" />

[[Image:Flammie.jpg|thumb|Characters riding atop Flammie (from ''[[Seiken Densetsu 3]]'')]]
Flammie, sometimes spelled Flammy, is the name of a fictional species of flying dragons, as well as the proper name of some its members, featured in several games of the series. A Flammie's appearance is a mixture of [[dragon|draconian]], [[mammal]]ian, and [[reptile|reptilian]] features, and its coloring has varied throughout the series. Flammies typically serve as a mean of transportation in the game by allowing a player's characters to ride on a Flammie's back to different locations in the game's world. In ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' and ''[[Seiken Densetsu 3]]'', the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]]'s [[Mode 7]] graphic capabilities allows the player to control a Flammie from either a "behind the back" [[Grammatical person|third-person]] or top-down perspective, and fly over the landscape as it scrolls beneath them.<ref>{{cite book| title=Secret of Mana Instruction Booklet| date=1993-10-03| publisher=[[Square Co.|Square Soft]]| id=SNS-K2-USA| pages=pp. 30<U+2013>31 | chapter=Modes of Travel}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=Seiken Densetsu 3 Instruction Booklet| date=1995-09-30| publisher=[[Square Co.]]| language=Japanese| id=SHVC-A3DJ-JPN | pages=p. 27| chapter=Means of Local Transportation}}</ref> In ''[[Children of Mana]]'', the player selects on a world map a number of destinations he or she wishes to fly to with a Flammie.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/mana/| title=The World of Mana| accessdate=2007-06-12| publisher=[[Square Enix]]| language=Japanese}}</ref> In terms of story, the Flammies were created by the Moon Gods, and are part of an endless cycle of destruction and rebirth as the stronger versions of Flammies<U+2014>known as Mana Beasts, or {{nihongo|God Beasts|<U+795E><U+7363>|Kami Kemono}} in Japanese<U+2014>destroy the world and the Mana Sword and Tree restore the world.<ref>{{cite video game| title=[[Legend of Mana]]| developer=[[Square Co.]]| date=2000-06-07| platform=[[PlayStation]]| level=World History Encyclopedia| quote=Dark Clouds - [<U+2026>] But dark clouds came to Fa'Diel, and the Moon Gods created greater beasts, and set them loose upon the land.

==Music==
The ''Mana'' series has had several different [[composer]]s. ''[[Final Fantasy Adventure]]'' was composed by [[Kenji Ito]]; it was his second original score.<ref name="Ito website">{{cite web| url=http://ito.cocoebiz.com/news/index.php| title=News| accessdate=2007-06-15| author=CocoeBiz staff| work=Kenji Ito's Official English Website| publisher=CocoeBiz}}</ref> Ito's music is mainly inspired by images from the game rather than outside influences.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://ito.cocoebiz.com/interviews/interview1.php| title=Interview with CocoeBiz in December 2004| accessdate=2007-06-15| date= December 2004| author=Ezaki, Kahori| coauthors=McCawley, James| work=Kenji Ito's Official English Website| publisher=CocoeBiz}}</ref> The scores for ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' and ''[[Seiken Densetsu 3]]'' were both composed by [[Hiroki Kikuta]].
