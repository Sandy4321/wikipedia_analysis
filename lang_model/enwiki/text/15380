'''St Nicolas Church''' is an [[Anglican]] church in the [[Portslade]] area of the English city of [[Brighton and Hove]].  It has 12th-century origins, and serves the old village of Portslade, inland from the mostly 19th-century Portslade-by-Sea area.<ref name="Middleton214">{{cite book |last=Middleton |first=Judy |title=A History of Hove |origyear=1979 |publisher=Phillimore & Co |location=Chichester |isbn=0-85033-325-3 |pages=p214 }}</ref>

==History==
A [[Roman road]] ran from north to south through the area which later became Portslade.  There was no recorded Roman settlement, although [[Samian ware]] pottery has been found nearby and neighbouring [[Southwick, West Sussex|Southwick]] had a [[Roman villa]].<ref name="Middleton212">{{cite book |last=Middleton |first=Judy |title=A History of Hove |origyear=1979 |publisher=Phillimore & Co |location=Chichester |isbn=0-85033-325-3 |pages=p212 }}</ref>  A village began to develop in mediaeval times, and a manor house and church were built close to each other in the 12th century.  As originally built, the church consisted of a [[chancel]], a [[nave]] with an [[aisle]] on the south side, and a square tower at the west end.<ref name="Dale228">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p228 }}</ref>  The nave, aisle and part of the tower appear to have been built first,<ref name="IoEStNicolas">{{cite web|title=Images of England <U+2014> detailed record, Church of St Nicolas, South Street, Hove|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=365614&mode=quick|work=[[Images of England]]|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|year=2007|accessdate=2008-08-15}}</ref> along with the typically [[Norman architecture|Norman architectural feature]] of twin pillars of [[Caen stone]];<ref name="Middleton216">{{cite book |last=Middleton |first=Judy |title=A History of Hove |origyear=1979 |publisher=Phillimore & Co |location=Chichester |isbn=0-85033-325-3 |pages=p216 }}</ref> the chancel and the upper part of the tower were built in the early 13th century.<ref name="IoEStNicolas"/><ref name="Middleton216"/>  The [[Bell tower|bell tower]], with [[battlements]], was added at the top of the tower in the 14th century; the porch on the south side was added later, but probably by the 16th century.<ref name="Dale228"/><ref name="IoEStNicolas"/>

Portslade was originally the most populous and important of the villages and parishes west of [[Brighton]],<ref name="Middleton213">{{cite book |last=Middleton |first=Judy |title=A History of Hove |origyear=1979 |publisher=Phillimore & Co |location=Chichester |isbn=0-85033-325-3 |pages=p213 }}</ref> and St Nicolas Church never declined to a ruined state, unlike the churches at [[Hove]] ([[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's]]), [[Aldrington]] ([[St Leonard's Church, Aldrington|St Leonard's]]), [[Hangleton]] ([[St Helen's Church, Hangleton|St Helen's]]) or [[West Blatchington]] ([[St Peter's Church, West Blatchington|St Peter's]]).  However, the fabric of the church and its fixtures did decay gradually over time, and like many [[Churches and places of worship in Brighton and Hove|churches in Brighton and Hove]] it was altered and restored during the [[Victorian era]].<ref name="Middleton218">{{cite book |last=Middleton |first=Judy |title=A History of Hove |origyear=1979 |publisher=Phillimore & Co |location=Chichester |isbn=0-85033-325-3 |pages=p218 }}</ref>  Mediaeval wall paintings were uncovered in the nave in 1847, but were [[whitewash]]ed over and lost.  The [[mural]] depicted the [[Doom (painting)|Last Judgement]]; an illustrated article was subsequently written by the incumbent vicar for an archaeological journal, in which a date of 1440 was attributed to the painting.<ref name="IoEStNicolas"/><ref name="Middleton218"/><ref name="Dale229">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p229 }}</ref><ref name="Dale230">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p230 }}</ref>  An aisle was added on the north side in 1849.<ref name="IoEStNicolas"/>

The church roof was made of heavy stone slabs, and significant repair work had to be carried out in 1959: it was not only sagging in places, but had been displaced by {{convert|1|ft|cm}} because of their weight<U+2014>despite the support given by substantial wooden [[king post]]s.  For most of that year, a [[Jack (device)|jack]], anchored under the chancel arch, was used to gradually move the roof back into position.<ref name="Middleton223">{{cite book |last=Middleton |first=Judy |title=A History of Hove |origyear=1979 |publisher=Phillimore & Co |location=Chichester |isbn=0-85033-325-3 |pages=p223 }}</ref>  At the same time, a [[vestry]] and a gallery for the [[Organ (music)|organ]] were added.<ref name="IoEStNicolas"/>

One of Portslade's most prominent families,<ref name="Middleton218"/> the Brackenburys, had their family vault at the church, and between 1869 and 1874<ref name="Middleton218"/><ref name="Dale230"/><ref name="Pevsner459">{{cite book |last= Nairn |first= Ian |authorlink= Ian Nairn |coauthors= [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner, Nikolaus]] |title= The Buildings of England: Sussex |publisher= [[Penguin Books]] |location = Harmondsworth |year= 1965 |isbn= 0-14-071028-0 |pages= p459 }}</ref> the Brackenbury Chapel was built at its west end.  Highly elaborate, in contrast to the simple church, it was built by [[Hannah Brackenbury]], who was buried there when she died in 1873.  She was a benefactor to local causes and charities, and to [[Balliol College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]], where a [[Debate|debating society]] and a building at the college entrance are named after her.<ref name="StN-Hannah">{{cite web|title=Hannah Bra(c)kenbury 1795<U+2013>1873|url=http://www.stnicolas.standrewportslade.btinternet.co.uk/hannah_brakenbury_portslade.htm|accessdate=2008-10-23|publisher=St Nicolas & St Andrew Portslade PCC|year=2008|work=Parish of St Nicolas and St Andrew website}}</ref> She also donated land and money for the construction of the local [[primary school]]<U+2014>a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building of 1872.<ref name="Middleton219">{{cite book |last=Middleton |first=Judy |title=A History of Hove |origyear=1979 |publisher=Phillimore & Co |location=Chichester |isbn=0-85033-325-3 |pages=p219 }}</ref>

==Architecture==
[[Image:St Nicolas Church, Portslade 02.JPG|thumb|right|The twin lancets and sexfoil in the east wall]]
The church is a relatively plain, uncomplicated structure, similar in layout to many 12th- and 13th-century churches in Sussex.<ref name="Pevsner459"/>  The chancel, with its [[Chamfer|chamfered]] [[Norman architecture|Norman]] arch, leads to the three-[[Bay (architecture)|bay]] nave with aisles on the south and north sides.<ref name="IoEStNicolas"/>  In the older south aisle, the [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] have [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] decorated with a [[scallop]] design.<ref name="IoEStNicolas"/><ref name="Pevsner459"/>  The 19th-century north aisle is similar but wider.<ref name="Pevsner459"/>  Also in the chancel are a restored [[sedilia]], [[piscina]] (both 13th-century, and on the south wall),<ref name="Dale229"/> [[pulpit]] of stone, a modern [[altar]],<ref name="IoEStNicolas"/> and a [[reredos]] and panelling dating from 1921.<ref name="Dale230"/> Most windows are [[Lancet window|lancets]]; some date from the 13th century,<ref name="Pevsner459"/> and most contain plain glass.  Two [[stained glass]] windows depict [[Francis of Assisi|St Francis of Assisi]] and [[Saint Nicholas|St Nicolas]].<ref name="Middleton218"/>  The east end windows consist of two tall, narrow lancets below a [[sexfoil]] (six-lobed window).<ref name="Pevsner459"/>

The Brackenbury Chapel is more ornate, featuring a three-pane lancet window with stained glass (including the family's [[coat of arms]]), elaborately carved wood, stonework and black and green [[marble]].<ref name="Middleton218"/>  In the centre is a marble [[tomb]], and the walls<U+2014>flanked by [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]]<U+2014>feature memorial tablets to family members.<ref name="Dale230"/>  The chapel is built of [[Flintknapping|knapped flint]], unlike the rest of the church which is pale [[Rubble|rubble-work]].  A partition links the chapel and the north aisle of the church.<ref name="IoEStNicolas"/>

The turreted tower, in three parts<U+2014>the 12th-century base, the 13th-century upper section and the bell tower<U+2014>is of [[Course (architecture)|coursed stone]] rubble-work, rather than the random arrangement in the main walls of the church.  It has no [[buttress]]es.<ref name="IoEStNicolas"/>

'''St Andrew's Church''' was built on Church Road in Portslade-by-Sea between 1863 and 1864.  It was designed by Brighton-based architect Edmund Scott.  In 1898 it was given its own parish,<ref name="Dale228"/> but this has now been united with the parish of St Nicolas.<ref name="ACNY-StNicolas">{{cite web|title=St Nicolas, Portslade|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/portslade-st-nicolas/|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=Oxford Diocesan Publications Ltd|year=2007|work=A Church Near You website}}</ref>  The combined [http://www.achurchnearyou.com/parish.php?p=10/99 parish] covers the whole of Portslade-by-Sea and Portslade Village, and extends some way on to the south face of the [[South Downs]].
