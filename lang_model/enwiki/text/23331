'''Vygotsky Circle''' - an informal personal network of scholars associated with [[Lev Vygotsky]] (1896-1934) and [[Alexander Luria]] (1902-1977) active in 1920-early 1940s in the Soviet Union (Moscow, Leningrad, and Kharkov). The group comprised mostly psychologists, educationalists, medical specialists, physiologists, and neuroscientists, and included such individuals as Leonid Sakharov, Boris Varshava, [[Nikolai Bernstein]], Solomon Gellerstein, Mark Lebedinsky, [[Leonid Zankov]], [[Aleksei N. Leontiev]], [[Alexander Zaporozhets]], [[Daniil Elkonin]], [[Lydia Bozhovich]], [[Bluma Zeigarnik]], Filipp Bassin, and many others (altogether around three dozen individuals at different periods). German-American psychologist [[Kurt Lewin]] and Russian film director and art theorist [[Sergei Eisenstein]] are also mentioned as the "peripheral members" of the Circle. The work of the Circle contributed to the foundation of the integrative science of mind, brain, and behavior in their cultural and biosocial development also known under somewhat vague and imprecise name of [[cultural-historical psychology]]. The group dispersed after the German invasion of the Soviet Union at the beginning of WWII, but the influence of its former members was quite notable in Soviet science of the postwar period, especially after Soviet psychology finally came to power in early 1960s.

== History of the Circle==
The Vygotsky Circle was formed around 1924 in Moscow after Vygotsky moved there from the provincial town of Gomel in Belarus. The group grew incrementally and operated in Moscow, Kharkov, and Leningrad (all in the Soviet Union) until Vygotsky's death in June 1934. Since then and until the beginning of WWII several centers of post-Vygotskian research were formed by Luria, Leontiev, Zankov, and Elkonin. However, as a result of growing control over science and following a period of political persecutions of Stalin's [[Great Terror]] a new center was formed around 1939 under the leadership of Luria and Leontiev. In the after-war period this developed into the so-called the "School of Vygotsky-Leontiev-Luria". Recent studies show that this "school" never existed as such.
