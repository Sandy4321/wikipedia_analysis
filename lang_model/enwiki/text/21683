'''The history of numerical weather prediction''' considers how current weather conditions as input into [[mathematical model]]s of the atmosphere and oceans to [[weather forecasting|predict the weather]] and future sea state (the process of [[numerical weather prediction]]) has changed over the years.  Though first attempted in the 1920s, it was not until the advent of the computer and [[computer simulation]] that computation time was reduced to less than the forecast period itself.  [[ENIAC]] was used to created the first forecasts via computer in 1950, and over the years more powerful computers have been used to increase the size of initial datasets as well as include more complicated versions of the equations of motion.  The development of global forecasting models led to the first climate models.  The development of limited area (regional) models facilitated advances in forecasting the tracks of [[tropical cyclone]] as well as [[air quality]] in the 1970s and 1980s.  

Because the output of forecast models based on [[atmospheric dynamics]] requires corrections near ground level, [[model output statistics]] (MOS) were developed in the 1970s and 1980s for individual ''forecast points'' (locations). The MOS apply statistical techniques to post-process the output of dynamical models with the most recent surface observations and the forecast point's climatology.  This technique can correct for model resolution as well as model biases.  Even with the increasing power of supercomputers, the [[forecast skill]] of numerical weather models only extends to about two weeks into the future, since the density and quality of observations&mdash;together with the [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] nature of the [[partial differential equation]]s used to calculate the forecast&mdash;introduce errors which double every five days. The use of model ensemble forecasts since the 1990s helps to define the forecast uncertainty and extend weather forecasting farther into the future than otherwise possible.

==Roots==

Until the end of the 19th century, weather prediction was entirely subjective and based on empirical rules, with only limited understanding of the physical mechanisms behind weather processes. In 1901 [[Cleveland Abbe]], founder of the [[National Weather Service|United States Weather Bureau]], proposed that the atmosphere is governed by the same principles of [[thermodynamics]] and [[hydrodynamics]] that were studied in the previous century.<ref name="Abbe MWR">{{cite journal|last=Abbe|first=Cleveland|title=The Physical Basis of Long-Range Weather Forecasts|journal=[[Monthly Weather Review]]|year=1901|month=December|volume=29|issue=12|pages=551<U+2013>61|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/029/mwr-029-12-0551c.pdf|accessdate=2010-12-23}}</ref> In 1904, [[Vilhelm Bjerknes]] derived a two-step procedure for model-based weather forecasting. First, a ''[[Diagnostic equation|diagnostic step]]'' is used to process data to generate [[initial condition]]s, which are then advanced in time by a ''[[Prognostic equation|prognostic step]]'' that solves the [[initial value problem]].<ref name="Lynch JCP">{{cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Peter|title=The origins of computer weather prediction and climate modeling|journal=[[Journal of Computational Physics]]|date=2008-03-20|month=March|volume=227|issue=7|pages=3431<U+2013>44|doi=doi:10.1016/j.jcp.2007.02.034|publisher=[[University of Miami]]|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/personal/miskandarani/Courses/MPO662/Lynch,Peter/OriginsCompWF.JCP227.pdf|accessdate=2010-12-23}}</ref> He also identified seven variables that defined the state of the atmosphere at a given point: [[pressure]], [[temperature]], [[density]], [[humidity]], and the three components of the [[velocity]] vector.

In 1922, [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] published the first attempt at forecasting the weather numerically. Using a [[Hydrostatic equilibrium|hydrostatic]] variation of Bjerknes's primitive equations,<ref name="Lynch JCP"/> Richardson produced by hand a 6-hour forecast for the state of the atmosphere over two points in central Europe, taking at least six weeks to do so.<ref name="Lynch Ch1"/> His forecast calculated that the change in [[atmospheric pressure|surface pressure]] would be {{convert|145|mbar|inHg|lk=on}}, an unrealistic value incorrect by two orders of magnitude. The large error was caused by an imbalance in the pressure and wind velocity fields used as the initial conditions in his analysis.<ref name="Lynch JCP"/>

The first successful numerical prediction was performed using the [[ENIAC]] digital computer in 1950 by a team composed of American meteorologists [[Jule Charney]], Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist [[Ragnar Fj<U+00F8>rtoft]] and applied mathematician [[John von Neumann]].  They used a simplified form of [[atmospheric dynamics]] based on solving the [[barotropic vorticity equation]] over a single layer of the atmosphere, by computing the [[geopotential height]] of the atmosphere's {{convert|500|mb|inHg}} pressure surface.<ref name="Charney 1950"/>  This simplification greatly reduced demands on computer time and memory, so the computations could be performed on the relatively primitive computers of the day.<ref>{{cite book|title=Storm Watchers|page=208|year=2002|author=Cox, John D.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|ISBN=047138108X}}</ref>  When news of the first weather forecast by ENIAC was received by Richardson in 1950, he remarked that the results were an "enormous scientific advance."<ref name="Lynch JCP"/> The first calculations for a 24&nbsp;hour forecast took ENIAC nearly 24&nbsp;hours to produce,<ref name="Lynch JCP"/> but Charney's group noted that most of that time was spent in "manual operations", and expressed hope that forecasts of the weather before it occurs would soon be realized.<ref name="Charney 1950">{{cite journal|last1=Charney|first1=Jule|last2=Fj<U+00F8>rtoft|first2=Ragnar|last3=von Neumann|first3=John|title=Numerical Integration of the Barotropic Vorticity Equation|journal=Tellus|year=1950|month=November|volume=2|issue=4|doi=10.1111/j.2153-3490.1950.tb00336.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2153-3490.1950.tb00336.x/pdf|accessdate=2011-01-03|authorlink1=Jule Charney|authorlink2=Ragnar Fj<U+00F8>rtoft|authorlink3=John von Neumann}}</ref>

Later models used more complete equations for atmospheric dynamics and [[atmospheric thermodynamics|thermodynamics]]. In 1959, Karl-Heinz Hinkelmann produced the first reasonable primitive equation forecast, 37 years after Richardson's failed attempt. Hinkelmann did so by removing small oscillations from the numerical model during initialization. In 1966, [[West Germany]] and the United States began producing operational forecasts based on primitive-equation models, followed by the United Kingdom in 1972 and Australia in 1977.<ref name="Lynch JCP"/><ref name="Leslie BOM">{{cite journal|last=Leslie|first=L.M.|coauthors=Dietachmeyer, G.S.|title=Real-time limited area numerical weather prediction in Australia: a historical perspective|journal=Australian Meteorological Magazine|year=1992|month=December|volume=41|issue=SP|pages=61<U+2013>77|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/amoj/docs/1992/leslie2.pdf|accessdate=2011-01-03|publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology]]}}</ref> Later additions to primitive equation models allowed additional insight into different weather phenomena.

==Global forecast models==
[[Image:Global Atmospheric Model.jpg|thumb|280 px|right|Models use systems of [[differential equations]] based on the laws of [[physics]], [[Fluid dynamics|fluid motion]], and [[chemistry]], and use a coordinate system which divides the planet into a 3D grid.  [[Winds]], [[heat transfer]], [[radiation]], [[relative humidity]], and surface [[hydrology]] are calculated within each grid and evaluate interactions with neighboring points.]]
A global forecast model is a weather forecasting model which initializes and forecasts the weather throughout the Earth's [[troposphere]].  It is a computer program that produces [[meteorological]] information for future times at given locations and altitudes.   Within any modern model is a set of equations, known as the [[primitive equations]], used to predict the future state of the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pielke|first=Roger A.|title=Mesoscale Meteorological Modeling|year=2002|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=0-12-554766-8|pages=48<U+2013>49|accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref>  These equations<U+2014>along with the [[ideal gas law]]<U+2014>are used to evolve the [[density]], [[pressure]], and [[potential temperature]] [[scalar field]]s and the [[velocity]] [[vector field]] of the atmosphere through time.

==Limited-area models==
The horizontal domain of a model is either ''global'', covering the entire Earth, or ''regional'', covering only part of the Earth. Regional models (also known as ''limited-area'' models, or LAMs) allow for the use of finer (or smaller) grid spacing than global models.  Essentially, the available computational resources are focused on a specific area instead of being spread over the globe.  This allows regional models to resolve explicitly smaller-scale meteorological phenomena that cannot be represented on the coarser grid of a global model.  Regional models use a global model for initial conditions of the edge of their domain in order to allow systems from outside the regional model domain to move into its area.  Uncertainty and errors within regional models are introduced by the global model used for the boundary conditions of the edge of the regional model, as well as errors attributable to the regional model itself.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6RQ3dnjE8lgC&pg=PA261&dq=use+of+ensemble+forecasts+book&hl=en&ei=nqIgTcuJLMX_lgeOn8m8DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=use%20of%20ensemble%20forecasts%20book&f=false|title=Numerical Weather and Climate Prediction|author=Warner, Thomas Tomkins |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2010|ISBN=978-0-521-51389-0|page=259|accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>

==Air quality models==
[[Image:Gaussian Plume.png|thumb|right|333px|Visualization of a buoyant Gaussian air pollutant dispersion plume]]
{{Main article|Atmospheric dispersion modeling}}
The technical literature on air pollution dispersion is quite extensive and dates back to the 1930s and earlier. One of the early air pollutant plume dispersion equations was derived by Bosanquet and Pearson.<ref>Bosanquet, C. H. and Pearson, J. L., "The spread of smoke and gases from chimneys", Transactions of the Faraday Society, 32:1249, 1936</ref> Their equation did not assume [[Normal distribution|Gaussian distribution]] nor did it include the effect of ground reflection of the pollutant plume.  Sir Graham Sutton derived an air pollutant plume dispersion equation in 1947 which did include the assumption of Gaussian distribution for the vertical and crosswind dispersion of the plume and also included the effect of ground reflection of the plume.<ref>Sutton, O. G., "The problem of diffusion in the lower atmosphere", Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 73:257, 1947 and "The theoretical distribution of airborne pollution from factory chimneys", Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 73:426, 1947</ref>  Under the stimulus provided by the advent of stringent [[Clean Air Act|environmental control regulations]], there was an immense growth in the use of air pollutant plume dispersion calculations between the late 1960s and today. A great many computer programs for calculating the dispersion of air pollutant emissions were developed during that period of time and they were called "air dispersion models". The basis for most of those models was the '''Complete Equation For Gaussian Dispersion Modeling Of [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Continuous, Buoyant Air Pollution Plumes]]'''  The Gaussian air pollutant dispersion equation requires the input of ''H'' which is the pollutant plume's centerline height above ground level<U+2014>and H is the sum of ''H''<sub>s</sub> (the actual physical height of the pollutant plume's emission source point) plus <U+0394>''H'' (the plume rise due the plume's buoyancy).

To determine <U+0394>''H'', many if not most of the air dispersion models developed between the late 1960s and the early 2000s used what are known as "the Briggs equations." G. A. Briggs first published his plume rise observations and comparisons in 1965.<ref>Briggs, G. A., "A plume rise model compared with observations", Journal of the Air Pollution Control Association, 15:433<U+2013>438, 1965</ref> In 1968, at a symposium sponsored by Conservation of Clean Air and Water in Europe, he compared many of the plume rise models then available in the literature.<ref>Briggs, G.A., "CONCAWE meeting: discussion of the comparative consequences of different plume rise formulas", Atmospheric Environment, 2:228<U+2013>232, 1968</ref> In that same year, Briggs also wrote the section of the publication edited by Slade<ref>Slade, D. H. (editor), "Meteorology and atomic energy 1968", Air Resources Laboratory, U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 1968</ref> dealing with the comparative analyses of plume rise models.  That was followed in 1969 by his classical critical review of the entire plume rise literature,<ref>Briggs, G. A., "Plume Rise", United States Army Environmental Command Critical Review Series, 1969</ref> in which he proposed a set of plume rise equations which have become widely known as "the Briggs equations".  Subsequently, Briggs modified his 1969 plume rise equations in 1971 and in 1972.<ref>Briggs, G. A., "Some recent analyses of plume rise observation", Proceedings of the Second International Clean Air Congress, Academic Press, New York, 1971</ref><ref>Briggs, G. A., "Discussion: chimney plumes in neutral and stable surroundings", Atmospheric Environment, 6:507<U+2013>510, 1972</ref>

The Urban Airshed Model, a regional forecast model for the effects of [[air pollution]] and [[acid rain]], was developed by a private company in the USA in 1970.  Development of this model was taken over by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] and improved in the mid to late 1970s using results from a regional air pollution study.  While developed in [[California]], this model was later used in other areas of [[North America]], [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] during the 1980s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Air pollution modeling and its application VIII, Volume 8|author=Steyn, D.

==Ocean models==
The first [[wind wave model|ocean wave models]] were developed in the 1960s and 1970s.  These models had the tendency to overestimate the role of wind in wave development and underplayed wave interactions.  A lack of knowledge concerning how waves interacted among each other, assumptions regarding a maximum wave height, and deficiencies in computer power limited the performance of the models.  After experiments were performed in 1968, 1969, and 1973, wind input from the Earth's atmosphere was weighted more accurately in the predictions.  A second generation of models was developed in the 1980s, but they could not realistically model [[swell (ocean)|swell]] nor depict [[wind wave|wind-driven waves]] (also known as wind waves) caused by rapidly changing wind fields, such as those within tropical cyclones.  This caused the development of a third generation of wave models from 1988 onward.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oh4410MzJ7cC&pg=PA50&dq=ocean+numerical+weather+prediction+book&hl=en&ei=9ysmTZzJE4iq8AalhpH-AQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=ocean%20numerical%20weather%20prediction%20book&f=false|title=Dynamics and modelling of ocean waves|author=Komen, G.

Within this third generation of models, the spectral wave transport equation is used to describe the change in wave spectrum over changing topography.  It simulates wave generation, wave movement (propagation within a fluid), [[wave shoaling]], [[refraction]], energy transfer between waves, and wave dissipation.<ref>{{cite book|page=270|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yBtOwfUG6cgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=spectral+wave+transport+equation&source=bl&ots=0E3XUBFqXe&sig=lKdQJ3MIF0I_ztu9ASjgoQwmoA4&hl=en&ei=zNRnTeTrPIbfgQfFmfDLCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&sqi=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=wave%20spectral%20transport%20equation&f=false|title=Numerical modeling of water waves|author=Lin, Pengzhi|publisher=Psychology Press|date=2008|ISBN=9780415415781}}</ref>  Since surface winds are the primary forcing mechanism in the spectral wave transport equation, ocean wave models use information produced by numerical weather prediction models as inputs to determine how much energy is transferred from the atmosphere into the layer at the surface of the ocean.  Along with dissipation of energy through [[Wind wave|whitecaps]] and [[resonance]] between waves, surface winds from numerical weather models allow for more accurate predictions of the state of the sea surface.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bender|first=Leslie C.|title=Modification of the Physics and Numerics in a Third-Generation Ocean Wave Model|journal=[[Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology]]|year=1996|month=January|volume=13|issue=3|pages=726|doi=10.1175/1520-0426(1996)013<0726:MOTPAN>2.0.CO;2|bibcode=1996JAtOT..13..726B}}</ref>

==Model output statistics==
{{Main article|Model output statistics}}
Because forecast models based upon the equations for atmospheric dynamics do not perfectly determine weather conditions near the ground, statistical corrections were developed to attempt to resolve this problem. Statistical models were created based upon the three-dimensional fields produced by numerical weather models, surface observations, and the climatological conditions for specific locations.  These statistical models are collectively referred to as [[model output statistics]] (MOS),<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=blEMoIKX_0IC&pg=PA188&dq=model+output+statistics+book&hl=en&ei=8KxVTcGPH4j2gAe_isnwDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CEgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=model%20output%20statistics%20book&f=false|page=189|title=When nature strikes: weather disasters and the law|author=Baum, Marsha L.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|date=2007|ISBN=9780275221294|accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref> and were developed by the [[National Weather Service]] for their suite of weather forecasting models by 1976.<ref>{{cite book|title=Model output statistics forecast guidance|author=Harry Hughes|publisher=United States Air Force Environmental Technical Applications Center|date=1976|pages=1<U+2013>16}}</ref>  The [[United States Air Force]] developed its own set of MOS based upon their dynamical weather model by 1983.<ref>{{cite book|title=Air Weather Service Model Output Statistics Systems|author=L.

==Ensembles==
{{main|Ensemble forecasting}}
As proposed by [[Edward Lorenz]] in 1963, it is impossible for long-range forecasts<U+2014>those made more than two weeks in advance<U+2014>to predict the state of the atmosphere with any degree of [[forecast skill|skill]], owing to the [[chaos theory|chaotic nature]] of the [[fluid dynamics]] equations involved.  Extremely small errors in temperature, winds, or other initial inputs given to numerical models will amplify and double every five days.<ref>{{cite book|title=Storm Watchers|pages=222<U+2013>224|year=2002|author=Cox, John D.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|ISBN=047138108X}}</ref>  Furthermore, existing observation networks have limited spatial and temporal resolution (for example, over large bodies of water such as the Pacific Ocean), which introduces uncertainty into the true initial state of the atmosphere.
