The '''Minnesota Timberwolves relocation to New Orleans''' was a failed 1994 effort to [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocate]] the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) franchise [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] to [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. After a prolonged courtship, the Top Rank group secured a contract to purchase the Timberwolves for $152.5 million from owners Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner, only to have the league reject the purchase in June 1994. Following the rejection by the league, Minnesota businessman [[Glen Taylor]] purchased the franchise and kept the team in Minneapolis. After failing to attract the [[Memphis Grizzlies|Vancouver Grizzlies]] in 2001, New Orleans would return to the NBA following the relocation of the [[New Orleans Hornets|Charlotte Hornets]] for the [[2002<U+2013>03 NBA season|2002<U+2013>03 season]].

==Relocation speculation==
By the [[1994 NBA All-Star Game]], speculation as to whether or not the Timberwolves would remain in Minneapolis following the [[1994<U+2013>95 NBA season|1994<U+2013>95 season]] became an issue. On February 11, 1994, NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] announced that he and his representatives would serve as mediators in an effort to resolve issues related to the debt owed on the [[Target Center]], the Timberwolves home arena.<ref name="February 12, 1994">{{cite news
