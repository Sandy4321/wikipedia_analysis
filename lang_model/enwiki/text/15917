'''Architects''' are a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[metalcore]] band from [[Brighton]], [[England]], formed in 2004. The band currently consists of [[lead vocalist]] Sam Carter, [[drummer]] Dan Searle and his twin brother, [[guitarist]] and [[keyboardist]] Tom Searle and Alex Dean on [[bass guitar]]. The band went through several name changes before they decided upon Architects. Their first name was ''Inharmonic'', which was swiftly changed to ''Counting the Days''. After a couple of years this was in turn changed to Architects. They have released five studio albums and one split ep with [[Dead Swans]].

They released their debut album ''[[Nightmares (Architects album)|Nightmares]]'' in 2006 on In At The Deep End records. After the departure of the original vocalist, Matt Johnson, Carter joined the band and made his first appearance on Architects' second album ''[[Ruin (album)|Ruin]]'' released in 2007 through United By Fate records. In 2009 the band released ''[[Hollow Crown]]'' through [[Century Media]] records. They then released their fourth album ''[[The Here And Now]]'' in 2011, which showed the band step in a more melodic "clean-cut post-hardcore" direction.<ref name="exclaim.ca-DB-Harms"/> Upon its release the album received critical acclaim but was panned by their fanbase.<ref name="exclaim.ca-DB-Zorgdrager"/> The next year Architects returned to their original style with their fifth album ''[[Daybreaker (Architects album)|Daybreaker]]'', with more [[Music and politics|politicised]] lyrics<ref name="Bigcheese-DB review"/> as opposed to the violent and comedic lyrics that can be heard throughout their older work.<ref name="Allmusic-bio"/> Their sixth album [[Lost Forever // Lost Together]] is being released on March 10th (UK & EU)/March 11th (US) 2014 through [[Epitaph Records]].

The band members are currently all vegan.<ref>http://www.peta2.com/heroes/architects-band-say-go-vegan/</ref> They all became vegan after watching several documentaries on the subject.<ref name="Rock Sound- WTMW"/>

==Biography==

===Formation and ''Nightmares'' (2002-2006)===
<!-- The use of 2002 instead of 2004 in the title is to point out any information about the members prior to the formation of the band. Example article: The Clash -->
{{Original research|section|date=July 2012}}
All of the members of ''Architects'' grew up around [[Brighton]], [[East Sussex]] and were very active within the local music scene prior to forming the band. Sam Carter, who was a drummer and studied drums at the [[Brighton Institute of Modern Music]] before joining ''Architects'', had an old band in which he supported [[Enter Shikari]] in Brighton.<ref name="Rock Sound- WTMW">{{cite journal |last= Sayce |first= Rob |date= July 2013 |title= Welcome To My World: Sam Carter |journal= [[Rock Sound]] |issue= 175 |page = 40 |publisher= Freeway Press |editor= Ben Patashnik| location= London, United Kingdom |issn=1465-0185}}</ref>

Architects was founded in 2004 by Drummer Dan Searle and his twin brother,<ref name="Allmusic-bio"/> Guitarist Tom Searle, The project was called "Counting the days" until it blossomed into what we now know as "Architects" with original vocalist Matt Johnson, guitarist Tim Hillier-Brook and Tim Lucas on bass guitar. In 2006 the band's original bassist, Tim Lucas, decided to leave the band to pursue his academic career. He was replaced by Alex Dean. The band had travelled around the UK on many tours supporting a number of different bands (Beecher, Bring Me the Horizon) in support of their debut album [[Nightmares (Architects album)|Nightmares]]. Because of the age of the band members in the early years they had to book weeks of holiday off at college in order to do tours round the country.<ref name="Metalhammer-hype band"/>

===Changing of lead vocalist and signing to Century Media (2007<U+2013>2009)===
In January 2007, after a lengthy tour around the country as an opening act to [[SikTh]] and Dead Man In Reno, Architects original vocalist Matt Johnson left the band. Dan Searle said that after Johnson left the band they all saw Sam Carter performing with other local bands and decided it was an "easy choice".<ref name="Lords of metal-sept2008"/> Ali Dean approached Carter while he was at work and had a few band practices.<ref name="Rock Sound- WTMW"/> When Carter joined as Architects' new lead vocalist he made his on-stage d<U+00E9>but by performing the song "The Darkest Tomb". After this amicable departure, Matt Johnson went on to form the band [[Whitemare]] with ex-members of [[Johnny Truant]] and Centurion, and also briefly Architects guitarist Tim Hillier-Brook on bass.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} They released their second album ''[[Ruin (album)|Ruin]]'' on 25 June 2007.<ref name="RS-Ruin Interview"/> Despite releasing their d<U+00E9>but album [[Nightmares (Architects album)|Nightmares]] the previous year the band felt they have developed as song writers a lot and wished to release something quicker.<ref name="RS-Ruin Interview"/> Carter felt pressure when writing the lyrics for 'Ruin' as he had a six-week period between joining 'Architects' and going into the studio to record.<ref name="RS-Hollow Crown Interview"/> Dan Searle had commented that Carter Drew from a lot more personal experience in his lyrics than their previous singer Johnson.<ref name="RS-Ruin Interview"/>

In early 2008, they released a [[Split EP]] with UK band [[Dead Swans]]. The split EP featured two songs from each artist. Architects' contributed: ''We're All Alone'' and ''Broken Clocks''. While ''Dead Swans'' contributed: ''In the Half Light'' and ''Swallow''. The song ''We're All Alone'' was later worked into ''Hollow Crown''. The band said that they wanted to do release the album in the effort to show people they are still progressing their style.<ref name="Lords of metal-sept2008"/> The split EP was well received by British music press with review scores of 7/10 from [[Metal Hammer]],<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.myspace.com/architectsuk/photos/32482571 | title = Metal Hammer review of Dead Swans split Photos from ARCHITECTS (ARCHITECTS) on Myspace | author = Marianne Harris | work = [[Metal Hammer]] | publisher = ([[TeamRock]]) | date = March 2008 | accessdate = 7 August 2012 | quote = }}</ref> 8/10 from [[Rock Sound]],<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.myspace.com/architectsuk/photos/32482581 | title = Rock Sound review of Dead Swans split Photos from ARCHITECTS (ARCHITECTS) on Myspace | author = Dan Morgan | work = [[Rock Sound]] | publisher = ([[Freeway Press]]) | date = March 2008 | accessdate = 7 August 2012 | quote = }}</ref> A 7.5 was given by [[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]] for Architects' side of the ep<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.myspace.com/architectsuk/photos/32482608 | title = Terrorizer review of Dead Swans split Photos from ARCHITECTS (ARCHITECTS) on Myspace | author = | work = [[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]] | publisher = ([[Dark Arts Ltd]]) | date = March 2008 | accessdate = 7 August 2012 | quote = }}</ref> and four "K"s out of 5 from [[Kerrang!]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.myspace.com/architectsuk/photos/26410020 | title = Kerrang review of Dead Swans Split E.P Photos from ARCHITECTS (ARCHITECTS) on Myspace | author = Katie Parsons | work = [[Kerrang!]] | publisher = ([[Bauer Media Group]]) | date = March 2008 | accessdate = 7 August 2012 | quote = }}</ref> The release was followed by a double headed tour of the UK.

In May 2008 Architects announced that they had been signed to [[Century Media Records]] for a three album deal.

In February 2011, Architects announced the departure of bassist Alex Dean, due to family commitments. On 3 July 2011 it was announced that Dean had rejoined the band. When Dean commented on the short 5-month split from the band he said "I<U+2019>m very happy to be able to say that I<U+2019>m back, being able to stay at home for the past few months have given my family and I the opportunity to adjust to what happened last year and I know it<U+2019>s done us all a lot of good."<ref name="Alex Dean departs and rejoins"/> During this period where Dean was not a part of the band [[Casey Lagos]] filled in as a bass guitarist on some of the tours.<ref name="UTGR-Casey Lagos"/>

In April 2011 [[Bring Me the Horizon]] as part of their ongoing support for their third album on their international [[There Is a Hell...

It started with a European tour, starting in the [[United Kingdom]] with [[The Devil Wears Prada (band)|The Devil Wears Prada]] as the opening support for the UK and [[dubstep]] group [[Tek-one]] opening for the remainder of continental Europe. On 28 April Matt Nicholls broke his arm whilst playing football with members of Bring Me the Horizon, Parkway Drive and Architects, and instead of cancelling the tour Architects' drummer Dan Searle filled in as the drummer, this meant that Bring Me the Horizon's setlist was halved in length.<ref name="mattbreaks arm">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/bring-me-the-horizon-drummer-breaks-arm/|title=Bring Me The Horizon Drummer Breaks Arm|publisher=[[Metal Hammer]]|author=James Gill|date=28 April 2008|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> This European Tour Lasted till late August.
