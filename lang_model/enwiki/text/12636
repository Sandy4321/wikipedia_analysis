The '''hamsa''' ({{lang-ar|<U+062E><U+0645><U+0633><U+0629>}} ''khomsah'', also romanized '''khamsa''', meaning lit. "five") is a palm-shaped [[amulet]] popular throughout the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], and commonly used in [[jewelry]] and wall hangings.<ref name=Bernasekp12>Bernasek et al., 2008, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=584VAQAAIAAJ&q=khamsa+%22middle+east%22+%22north+africa%22&dq=khamsa+%22middle+east%22+%22north+africa%22&hl=en&ei=_imrTe6mEMeSswbg7uSZCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CD4Q6AEwBDgK p. 12].</ref><ref name=Sonbolp355>Sonbol, 2005, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=uUe8tBUvwE4C&pg=PA355&dq=%22hand+of+fatima%22+evil+eye&hl=en&ei=_NyrTaeKNsrZsgaAm9j7Bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22hand%20of%20fatima%22%20evil%20eye&f=false pp. 355<U+2013>359].</ref> Depicting the open right hand, an image recognized and used as a sign of protection in many societies throughout history, the hamsa is believed to provide defense against the [[evil eye]]. The symbol predates Christianity and Islam. In Islam, it is also known as the '''hand of Fatima''', so named to commemorate [[Muhammad]]'s daughter [[Fatima Zahra]]. Levantine Christians call it the '''hand of Mary''', for the mother of [[Jesus]]. 

==Name and origins==
Khamsa is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word that literally means "five", but also "the five fingers of the hand."<ref name=Zennerp284>Zenner, 1988, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=xsaQeU2UFpMC&pg=PA284&dq=hamsa+%22evil+eye%22&hl=en&ei=BAirTfjiC8bWsgakq42DBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CFEQ6AEwBTg8#v=onepage&q=hamsa%20%22evil%20eye%22&f=false p. 284].</ref><ref name=WI>World Institute for Advanced Phenomenological Research and Learning (Belmont, Estados Unidos), 1991, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=PWPMfF-pzLQC&pg=PA219&dq=hamsa+%22evil+eye%22&hl=en&ei=ggWrTZKFJsyOswbCxan7Bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CF8Q6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&q=hamsa%20%22evil%20eye%22&f=false p. 219].</ref><ref name=Drazinp268>Drazin, 2009, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=PerLtdiAKx0C&pg=PA268&dq=%22hand+of+fatima%22+hamsa&hl=en&ei=IzWrTZD4Mc_fsgaR_ZSaCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDoQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22hand%20of%20fatima%22%20hamsa&f=false p. 268].</ref>

Its exact origins are unknown. A universal sign of protection, the image of the open right hand is seen in [[Mesopotamia]]n artifacts in the amulets of the Q<U+0101>t [[Ishtar|I<U+0161>tar]] and the Q<U+0101>t [[Inanna|Inana]] and in the [[Buddha]]'s gesture (''[[Mudra|mudr<U+0101>]]'') of teaching and protection.<ref name=Sonbolp355/> Other symbols of divine protection based around the hand include the Hand-of-Venus (or [[Aphrodite]]) and the Hand-of-Mary that was used to protect women from the evil eye, boost fertility and lactation, promote healthy pregnancies, and strengthen the weak.<ref name=Sonbolp355/> 

One theory postulates a connection between the khamsa and the Mano Pantea (or Hand-of-the-All-Goddess), an amulet known to ancient Egyptians as the Two Fingers. In this amulet, the Two Fingers represent [[Isis]] and [[Osiris]] and the thumb, their child [[Horus]] and it was used to invoke the protective spirits of parents over their child.<ref name=Sonbolp355/> Another theory traces the origins of the hamsa to [[Carthage]] ([[Phoenicia]]) where the hand (or in some cases [[vulva]]) of the supreme deity [[Tanit]] was used to ward off the evil eye.<ref name=Silverp201/> [[File:Hamsa.jpg|upright|thumb|A Hand of [[Miriam]]]]

With the advent of [[Islam]], the khamsa came to be known as the ''hand of Fatima'' to commemorate [[Fatima Zahra]], the daughter of the Prophet [[Muhammad]].<ref name=Badawip510/><ref name=Drazinp268/> Sources indicate that it is known to Europeans as the "hand of Fatima" or "hands of Fatima", while natives call it by its Arabic name ''khamsa'', ''khams'', or ''khoms''.<ref name=Houtsmap897>Houtsma, 1993, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=7CP7fYghBFQC&pg=PA897&dq=ten+arabic+two+hands+khamsa&hl=en&ei=sXs0Tom5EYrFswa1rZS7Ag&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 897].</ref><ref name=Shinarp117/> Arabs also call the amulet simply ''al-kaff'' ( "the hand").<ref name=Garryp143>{{cite book|title=Archetypes and motifs in folklore and literature: a handbook|Editors=Jane Garry, Hasan M.

The hamsa's path into Jewish culture, and its popularity particularly in [[Sephardic]] and [[Mizrahi]] Jewish communities, can be traced through its use in Islam.<ref name=Silverp201/><ref name=Sonbolp355/> This "favorite Muslim talisman" became a part of Jewish tradition in North African and Middle Eastern [[Jew]]ish communities.<ref name=Shadurp92>Shadur and Shadur, 2003, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=KR4ENrjIEckC&pg=PA92&dq=hamsa+%22evil+eye%22&hl=en&ei=ggWrTZKFJsyOswbCxan7Bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEwQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&q=hamsa%20%22evil%20eye%22&f=false p. 92].</ref> Jews retained the Arabic name hamsa, but renamed it the ''hand of [[Miriam]]'', referencing the sister of the biblical [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]], so as not to reference the daughter of the prophet of Islam.<ref name=Silverp201>Silver, 2008, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=gqyiX6bg0TYC&pg=PA201&dq=khamsa+evil+eye&lr=#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 201].</ref><ref name=Drazinp268/><ref name=Steinmetzp58>Steinmetz, 2005, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=Nk_RFL9LYg0C&pg=PA58&dq=hamsa+khamsa+arabic&hl=en&ei=FKszTrTOA4nRsgb9t9G5Ag&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=hamsa%20khamsa%20arabic&f=false p. 58].</ref>

The symbol of the hand appears in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] manuscripts and amulets, doubling as the [[Hebrew]] letter "shin,"  the first letter of "Shaddai," one of the names referring to God.<ref>[http://jewishmag.com/144mag/superstition_magic/superstition_magic.htm Angels and Demons]</ref> 

The khamsa holds recognition as a bearer of good fortune among Christians in the region as well. [[Levant]]ine Christians call it the ''hand of Mary'' (Arabic: ''Kef Miryam'', or the "[[Virgin Mary]]'s Hand").<ref name=Perennialp186>Perennial Books, 1970, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=s3Y4AAAAIAAJ&q=to+the+little-+known+fact+that+the+amulet+designated+as+the+%22hand+of+Fatima%22+is+called+by+Levantine+Christians+the+%22hand+of+Mary%22&dq=to+the+little-+known+fact+that+the+amulet+designated+as+the+%22hand+of+Fatima%22+is+called+by+Levantine+Christians+the+%22hand+of+Mary%22&hl=en&ei=GnU9Tp77NczHsgbL3LD5DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA p. 186].</ref><ref name=Trumballp77>Trumball, 1896, [http://books.google.ca/books?ei=aH49TvalDIvGswai48kH&ct=result&id=DKNZAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22keff+miryam%22&q=%22kef+miryam%22#search_anchor p. 77].</ref> Well after the end of Islamic rule in Spain, its use was significant enough to prompt an episcopal committee convened by [[Emperor Charles V]] to decree a ban on the Hand of Fatima and all open right hand amulets in 1526.<ref name=Sonbolp355/>

==Forms, symbolism, and usage==
[[File:Door knocker, N'Kob.jpg|thumb|upright|Door knocker in [[Morocco]]]]
The Hand (Khamsa), particularly the open right hand, is a sign of protection that also represents blessings, power, and strength, and is seen as potent in deflecting the evil eye.<ref name=Sonbolp355/><ref name=Rajabp116>Rajab, 1989, p. 116.</ref> One of the most common components of gold and silver [[jewellery]] in the region,<ref name=Badawip510/> historically and traditionally, it was most commonly carved in [[Jet (lignite)|jet]] or formed from silver, a metal believed to represent purity and hold magical properties.<ref name=Sonbolp355/><ref name=Lynchp8/> It is also painted in red (sometimes using the blood of a sacrificed animal) on the walls of houses for protection,<ref name=Schimmelp92/><ref name=Earlyp116/> or painted or hung on the doorways of rooms, such as those of an expectant mother or new baby.<ref name=Sonbolp355/> The hand can be depicted with the fingers spread apart to ward off evil, or as closed together to bring good luck.<ref name=Gomezp54/> Highly stylized versions may be difficult to recognize as hands, and can consist of five circles representing the fingers, situated around a central circle representing the palm.<ref name=Gomezp54>Gomez, 1996, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=ZbH5XYWiiy0C&pg=PA54&dq=stylized+khamsa&hl=en&ei=eyMCTuS2NtOr8APvqvGwDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=stylized%20khamsa&f=false p. 54].</ref>

Used to protect against evil eye, a malicious stare believed to be able to cause illness, death, or just general unluckiness, hamsas often contain an eye symbol.<ref name=Hamp385/><ref name=Lynchp8>Lynch and Roberts, 2010, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=4Qiq4ps_wDIC&pg=PT34&dq=khamsa+hand&hl=en&ei=bFs9TumDPczLswbpvJwL&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=khamsa%20hand&f=false p. 8].</ref> Depictions of the hand, the eye, or the number five in Arabic (and [[Berber people|Berber]]) tradition are related to warding off the evil eye, as exemplified in the saying ''khamsa fi ainek'' ("five [fingers] in your eye").<ref name=Hamp385>Ham and Bing, 2007, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=V_IMx-YYvJYC&pg=PA385&dq=khamsa+evil+eye#v=onepage&q=khamsa%20evil%20eye&f=false p. 385].</ref> Raising one's right hand with the palm showing and the fingers slightly apart is part of this curse meant "to blind the aggressor."<ref name=Schimmelp92>Schimmel, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=vrlwo4OqvWgC&pg=PA92&dq=%22hand+of+fatima%22&hl=en&ei=BDSrTZ_nKoj0sgas2KiOCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&q=%22hand%20of%20fatima%22&f=false p. 92].</ref> Another formula uttered against the evil eye in Arabic, but without hand gestures, is ''khamsa wa-khamis'' ("five and Thursday").<ref name=Lentp169>Lent et al., 1996, p. 189.</ref><ref name=Shinarp117>Shinar, 2004, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=1huFh8xcpLEC&pg=PA117&dq=khamsa+fish+hand&hl=en&ei=OO4zTtqxOofTsgaN9um6Ag&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=khamsa%20fish%20hand&f=false p. 117].</ref> As the fifth day of the week, Thursday is considered a good day for magic rites and pilgrimages to the tombs of revered saints to counteract the effects of the evil eye.<ref name=Houtsmap897/> 

The number five in Islam is connected to the open hand, the pentagram of the five senses, marriage, the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], the five daily prayers, and the hand of Fatima.<ref name=Sonbolp355/><ref name=Houtsmap897/> [[Sufism|Sufi]] staffs or poles are often topped with a khamsa.<ref name=Schimmelp92/> Among [[Shia Islam|Shiites]], the fingers of the hand of Fatima also represent the 'five holy persons' of the Prophet's family: Muhammed, Fatima, [[Ali]], [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hassan]], and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]].<ref name=Schimmelp92/><ref name=Sonbolp355/> Ali's name or those of all of [[The Twelve Imams]] are sometimes engraved on metal Hands of Fatima.<ref name=Schimmelp92/> Hamsas can also include a heart, a hexagram, or the word [[Allah]] inscribed in the palm of the hand.<ref name=Shinarp117/>
[[File:HamsaS.jpg|thumb|upright|Clay hamsa on a wall, inscribed with the Hebrew word "behatzlacha" <U+2013> literally "in success", or "good luck"]]
Due to its significance in both Arabic and Berber culture, the hamsa is one of the national symbols of [[Algeria]] and appears in its [[emblem of Algeria|emblem]]. It is also the most popular among the different [[amulet]]s (such as the Eye and the ''Hirz''<U+2014>a silver box containing verses of the [[Quran]]) for warding off the evil eye in [[Egypt]].<ref name=Badawip510>Badawi, 2004, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=ojiQTtPEFckC&pg=PA510&dq=khamsa+evil+eye&lr=#v=onepage&q=khamsa%20evil%20eye&f=false p. 510].</ref> Egyptian women who live in ''baladi'' ("traditional") urban quarters often make ''khamaysa'' which are amulets made up of five (''khamsa'') objects to attach to their children's hair or black aprons. The five objects can be made peppers, hands, circles, or stars hanging from hooks. Black aprons are also thought to ward off the evil eye.<ref name=Earlyp116>Early, 1993, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=ZR3rqNFBaUYC&pg=PA116&dq=khamsa+in+your+eye&hl=en&ei=WEBnTsuVGLHc4QTSz5i3DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&q=khamsa%20in%20your%20eye&f=false p. 116]</ref>

With the establishment of the [[State of Israel]], the widespread use of the talisman by Jews who came there from Islamic countries declined precipitously. Its association with superstition was out of place in the secularly conceived state, and according to writer Alexandra Nocke, its 'Easternness' was looked down upon in the Eurocentric [[Ashkenazi]] cultural milieu that dominated.<ref name=Nockep133/> 

In recent decades, that trend has been reversed with the renewed Israeli interest in [[Mizrahi]] folklore and customs and the hamsa's use is proliferating. In Israel today, it is a trendy symbol that has become "an icon of Israeliness and secularity," though its symbolism there is by no means all pervading or universal.<ref name=Nockep133>Nocke, 2009, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=z1EWdLtg4sAC&pg=PA133&dq=hamsa+%22evil+eye%22+%22middle+east%22+%22north+africa%22&hl=en&ei=5R2rTcjMNorFswbs4rnzCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=hamsa%20%22evil%20eye%22%20%22middle%20east%22%20%22north%20africa%22&f=false pp. 133<U+2013>134].</ref> A popular 'good luck' charm, it appears on necklaces, keychains, postcards, telephone and lottery cards, and in advertisements.<ref name=Nockep133/>  It is also incorporated into high-end jewellery, decorative tilework, and wall decorations.<ref name=Nockep133/>
