The '''Rice Northwest Museum of Rocks and Minerals''' is a non-profit museum in [[Hillsboro, Oregon]], United States. Located just north of the [[Sunset Highway (Oregon)|Sunset Highway]] on the northern edge of Hillsboro, the [[earth science]] museum is in the [[Portland metropolitan area]]. Opened in 1997, the museum<U+2019>s collections date to the 1930s with the museum housed in a home built to display the rock and mineral collections of the museum founders. The ranch style home is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], the first of its kind listed in [[Oregon]].

The museum sits on 23 wooded acres (9.3 ha), with the main building containing {{convert|7500|ft2}} of space. Collections include petrified wood, various fossils, [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] minerals, [[meteorite]]s, [[zeolite]]s, and a variety of other minerals. With more than 20,000 specimens, the museum is the largest of its kind in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. The facility has around 25,000 visitors each year, many of whom are on school tours.
