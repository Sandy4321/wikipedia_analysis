The '''Fourteenth Amendment''' ('''Amendment XIV''') to the [[United States Constitution]] was adopted on July 9, 1868, as one of the [[Reconstruction Amendments]]. The amendment addresses citizenship rights and equal protection of the laws, and was proposed in response to issues related to former slaves following the [[American Civil War]]. The amendment was bitterly contested, particularly by [[Southern United States|Southern states]], which were forced to ratify it in order for them to regain representation in the Congress. The Fourteenth Amendment, particularly its first section, is one of the most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for landmark decisions such as ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973), regarding abortion, and ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' (2000), regarding the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]]. It applies to the actions of all [[State actor|state and local officials]], but not to those of private parties.

The second, third, and fourth sections of the amendment are seldom, if ever, litigated. The fifth section gives Congress enforcement power. The amendment's first section includes several clauses: the [[Citizenship Clause]], [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]], [[Due Process Clause]], and [[Equal Protection Clause]]. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, overruling the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857), which had held that Americans descended from African slaves could not be citizens of the United States. The Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted in such a way that it does very little.

The Due Process Clause prohibits state and local government officials from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without legislative authorization. This clause has also been used by the federal judiciary to make most of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|applicable to the states]], as well as to recognize [[Substantive due process|substantive]] and [[Due process#Procedural due process|procedural]] requirements that state laws must satisfy.

The Equal Protection Clause requires each state to provide equal protection under the law to all people within its [[jurisdiction]]. This clause was the basis for ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954), the Supreme Court decision that precipitated the dismantling of [[racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], and for many other decisions rejecting irrational or unnecessary discrimination against people belonging to various groups.

{{quote|'''Section 1.''' All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

'''Section 2.''' Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.

'''Section 3.''' No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.

'''Section 4.''' The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.

'''Section 5.''' The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html|title=Constitution of the United States: Amendments 11&ndash;27|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=June 11, 2013|archivedate=June 11, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HIWJcreJ|deadurl=no}}</ref>}}

=== Proposal by Congress ===
In the final years of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era]] that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and the 1865 [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]] grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], regardless of whether the former slaves were allowed to vote.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref name="Stromberg111">Stromberg, "A Plain Folk Perspective" (2002), p. 111.</ref> Republicans began looking for a way to offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref>{{cite book |title=The Fourteenth Amendment: From Political Principle to Judicial Doctrine |last=Nelson |first=William E. |year=1988 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674041424 |page=47 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VMCXjRyyKTQC&pg=PA46&dq=thirteenth+amendment+%22three+fifths%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Bz-xUemzGMX8rAGamYDgDQ&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=thirteenth%20amendment%20%22three%20fifths%22&f=false |accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>Stromberg, "A Plain Folk Perspective" (2002), p. 112.</ref>

In 1865, Congress passed what would become the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] passed by many post-war states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and by preventing them from suing or testifying in court.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=Reconstruction|pages=199<U+2013>200|isbn=0-8071-2234-3}}</ref> The Civil Rights Act was vetoed by President [[Andrew Johnson]], an unapologetic white supremacist.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|pp=21&ndash;22}} Congress overrode his veto in April 1866, but the experience encouraged them to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|pp=22&ndash;23}} Moreover, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act doubted that Congress really possessed constitutional power to enact it.<ref>Rosen, Jeffrey.

''The Constitution and its Amendments'', Vol. 4, p. 8 (Macmillan 1999).</ref>

Over 70 proposals for an amendment were drafted.<ref>Soifer, <U+201C>Prohibition of Voluntary Peonage<U+201D> (2012), p. 1614.</ref> In late 1865, the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Reconstruction|Joint Committee on Reconstruction]] proposed an amendment stating that any citizens barred from voting on the basis of race by a state would not be counted for purposes of representation of that state.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=252}} This amendment passed the House, but was blocked in the Senate by a coalition of [[Radical Republican]]s led by [[Charles Sumner]], who believed the proposal a "compromise with wrong", and Democrats opposed to black rights.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=253}} Consideration then turned to a proposed amendment by Representative [[John A. Bingham]] of Ohio, which would enable Congress to safeguard "equal protection of life, liberty, and property" of all citizens; this proposal failed to pass the House.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=253}} In April 1866, the Joint Committee forwarded a third proposal to Congress, a carefully negotiated compromise that combined elements of the first and second proposals as well as addressing the issues of Confederate debt and voting by ex-Confederates.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=253}} The wording was further modified by several close votes in the House and Senate.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=256}} This compromise version passed both houses in a largely party-line vote, with Republicans supporting and Democrats opposed.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=25}}

The [[Radical Republicans]] were satisfied that they had secured civil rights for blacks, but were disappointed that the amendment would not also secure political rights for blacks, in particular the right to vote.<ref name=Carter>Carter, Dan.  ''When the War Was Over: The Failure of Self-Reconstruction in the South, 1865-1867'', pp. 242-243 (LSU Press 1985).</ref> For example, [[Thaddeus Stevens]], a leader of the disappointed Radical Republicans, said: "I find that we shall be obliged to be content with patching up the worst portions of the ancient edifice, and leaving it, in many of its parts, to be swept through by the tempests, the frosts, and the storms of despotism."<ref name=Graber1502>Graber, "Subtraction by Addition?" (2012), pp. 1501<U+2013>1502.</ref><ref name=Carter /> Abolitionist [[Wendell Phillips]] called it a "fatal and total surrender".<ref name=Graber1502 /> This point would later be addressed by the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]].  The [[39th United States Congress]] proposed the Fourteenth Amendment on June 13, 1866.

Ratification of the amendment was bitterly contested: all the Southern state legislatures, with the exception of Tennessee, refused to ratify. This refusal led to the passage of the [[Reconstruction Acts]]. Ignoring the existing state governments, military government was imposed until new civil governments were established and the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.<ref name=america.gov>{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/educ-english/2008/April/20080407120920eaifas0.4535639.html|title=The Civil War And Reconstruction|accessdate=October 21, 2010}}</ref> 

Abolitionist leaders including Phillips criticized the amendment's endorsement of a state's right to deny the vote on the basis of race.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=255}} The reference to "male inhabitants" in Section 2 was the first reference to gender in the Constitution, and was condemned by [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffragists]] such as [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Susan B. Anthony]] who had long seen their cause as linked to that of black rights. The separation of black civil rights from women's civil rights split the two movements for decades.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=255&ndash;256}}

On March 2, 1867, the Congress passed a law that required any formerly Confederate state to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment before "said State shall be declared entitled to representation in Congress".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=014/llsl014.db&recNum=459|title=Library of Congress, Thirty-Ninth Congress Session II|accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref>

By July 9, 1868, South Carolina and Louisiana ratified the amendment, bringing the total states that had ratified to the necessary three-fourths (28 of 37).<ref name=GPO>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/HMAN-112/html/HMAN-112-pg99.htm|title=Amendment XIV|publisher=US Government Printing Office|accessdate=June 23, 2013|archivedate=June 23, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HabE9Mjd|deadurl=no}}</ref>{{efn|The first 28 states to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment are as follows:

On July 20, 1868, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] certified that the amendment had become part of the Constitution if the rescissions were ineffective, and presuming also that the later ratifications by states whose governments had been reconstituted superseded the initial rejection of the prior state legislatures.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Library of Congress|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774-1875|pages=707|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=015/llsl015.db&recNum=740}}</ref> The Congress responded on the following day, declaring that the amendment was part of the Constitution and ordering Seward to [[Promulgation|promulgate]] the amendment.<ref name=Killian>{{cite book|title=The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation: Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 28, 2002|last=Killian|first=Johnny H. et al.|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=9780160723797|page=31|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bJjxj5gLRaEC&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=seward+July+28,+1868+promulgate&source=bl&ots=UIfbKPoYbM&sig=wrDGVZojLHm7WECJZD9ym3qXIEQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=et3GUZ7WIITc8wTkkoDYDw&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=seward%20July%2028%2C%201868%20promulgate&f=false}}</ref>

Meanwhile, two additional states had ratified the amendment: Alabama (July 13, 1868, the date the ratification was approved by the governor) and Georgia (July 21, 1868, after having rejected it on November 9, 1866).<ref name=GPO /> Thus, on July 28, Seward was able to certify unconditionally that the amendment was part of the Constitution without having to endorse the Congress's assertion that the rescissions were ineffective.<ref name=Killian />

After the Democrats won the legislative election in Oregon, they passed a rescission of the Unionist Party's previous adoption of the amendment. The rescission was ignored as too late, as it came on October 15, 1868. The amendment has since been ratified by all of the 37 states that were in the Union in 1868, including Ohio, New Jersey, and Oregon re-ratifying after their rescissions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chin|first=Gabriel J.|coauthors=Abraham, Anjali|year=2008|title=Beyond the Supermajority: Post-Adoption Ratification of the Equality Amendments|journal=Arizona Law Review|volume=50|page=25|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1076805}}</ref>{{efn|Later ratification dates for the Fourteenth Amendment are as follows:

==Citizenship and civil rights==
{{double image|right|14th Amendment Pg1of2 AC.jpg|190|14th Amendment Pg2of2 AC.jpg|190|The two pages of the Fourteenth Amendment in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]}}

===Background===
Section 1 of the amendment formally defines United States citizenship and also protects various [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] from being abridged or denied by any state or [[state actor]].  Abridgment or denial of those civil rights by private persons is not addressed by this amendment; the Supreme Court held in the  ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' (1883)<ref name=CRC/> that the amendment was limited to "state action" and, therefore, did not authorize the Congress to outlaw [[Racism|racial discrimination]] by private individuals or organizations (though Congress can sometimes reach such discrimination via other parts of the Constitution).

The Radical Republicans who advanced the Thirteenth Amendment hoped to ensure broad civil and human rights for the newly freed people<U+2014>but its scope was disputed before it even went into effect.<ref>Graber, "Subtraction by Addition?" (2012), p. 1523.</ref>  The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment wanted these principles enshrined in the Constitution to protect the new Civil Rights Act from being declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and also to prevent a future Congress from altering it by a mere majority vote.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|pp=23&ndash;24}}<ref name=Foner>[[Eric Foner]], "The Second American Revolution", ''In These Times'', September 1987; reprinted in ''Civil Rights Since 1787'', ed. Jonathan Birnbaum & Clarence Taylor, NYU Press, 2000. ISBN 0814782493</ref> This section was also in response to violence against black people within the Southern states. The Joint Committee on Reconstruction found that only a Constitutional amendment could protect black people's rights and welfare within those states.<ref>{{cite journal|ssrn=1120308|title=Finkelman, Paul, John Bingham and the Background to the Fourteenth Amendment|journal=Akron Law Review, Vol. 36, No. 671, 2003|publisher=Ssrn.com|date=April 2, 2009}}</ref>

This first section of the amendment has been the most frequently litigated part of the amendment,<ref>Harrell, David and Gaustad, Edwin.  ''Unto A Good Land: A History Of The American People'', Volume 1, p. 520 (Eerdmans Publishing, 2005): "The most important, and the one that has occasioned the most litigation over time as to its meaning and application, was Section One."</ref> and this amendment in turn has been the most frequently litigated part of the Constitution.<ref>Stephenson, D.  ''The Waite Court: Justices, Rulings, and Legacy'', p. 147 (ABC-CLIO, 2003).</ref>

===Citizenship Clause===
{{Main|Citizenship Clause}}
[[File:Jacob M. Howard - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Jacob M. Howard]] of Michigan, author of the Citizenship Clause]]
This clause of the amendment overruled the Supreme Court's [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'' decision]] that [[black people]] were not citizens and could not become citizens, nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship.<ref>{{cite journal|ssrn=1023809|title=Tsesis, Alexander, The Inalienable Core of Citizenship: From Dred Scott to the Rehnquist Court|journal=Arizona State Law Journal, Vol. 39, 2008|publisher=Ssrn.com}}</ref><ref>''[[McDonald v. Chicago]]'', 130 S. Ct. 3020, 3060 (2010) ("This [clause] unambiguously overruled this Court's contrary holding in ''Dred Scott''.")</ref> The [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] had granted citizenship to all persons born in the United States if they were not subject to a foreign power, and this clause of the Fourteenth Amendment constitutionalized this rule.

There are varying interpretations of the original intent of Congress and of the ratifying states, based on statements made during the congressional debate over the amendment, as well as the customs and understandings prevalent at that time.<ref>Messner, Emily. [http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thedebate/2006/03/born_in_the_usa.html <U+201C>Born in the U.S.A.

====Native Americans====
During the original congressional debate over the amendment Senator [[Jacob M. Howard]] of Michigan<U+2014>the author of the Citizenship Clause<ref name=Salon>LaFantasie, Glenn (March 20, 2011) [http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/03/20/lafantasie_civil_war_consensus/index.html The erosion of the Civil War consensus], ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''</ref><U+2014>described the clause as having the same content, despite different wording, as the earlier Civil Rights Act of 1866, namely, that it excludes [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who maintain their tribal ties and "persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers."<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=073/llcg073.db&recNum=11 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2893] Senator [[Reverdy Johnson]] said in the debate: "Now, all this amendment provides is, that all persons born in the United States and not subject to some foreign Power--for that, no doubt, is the meaning of the committee who have brought the matter before us--shall be considered as citizens of the United States...If there are to be citizens of the United States entitled everywhere to the character of citizens of the United States, there should be some certain definition of what citizenship is, what has created the character of citizen as between himself and the United States, and the amendment says citizenship may depend upon birth, and I know of no better way to give rise to citizenship than the fact of birth within the territory of the United States, born of parents who at the time were subject to the authority of the United States."</ref> According to historian Glenn W. LaFantasie of [[Western Kentucky University]], "A good number of his fellow senators supported his view of the citizenship clause."<ref name=Salon/> Others also agreed that the children of ambassadors and foreign ministers were to be excluded.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=073/llcg073.db&recNum=11 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2897].</ref><ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=070/llcg070.db&recNum=702 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 1, p. 572].</ref> 

Senator [[James Rood Doolittle]] of Wisconsin asserted that all Native Americans were subject to United States jurisdiction, so that the phrase "Indians not taxed" would be preferable,<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=073/llcg073.db&recNum=11 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, pp. 2890,2892-4,2896].</ref> but [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman]] [[Lyman Trumbull]] and Howard disputed this, arguing that the federal government did not have full jurisdiction over Native American tribes, which govern themselves and make treaties with the United States.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=073/llcg073.db&recNum=14 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2893]. Trumbull, during the debate, said, "What do we [the committee reporting the clause] mean by 'subject to the jurisdiction of the United States'? Not owing allegiance to anybody else. That is what it means." He then proceeded to expound upon what he meant by "complete jurisdiction": "Can you sue a Navajoe Indian in court?...We make treaties with them, and therefore they are not subject to our jurisdiction.... If we want to control the Navajoes, or any other Indians of which the Senator from Wisconsin has spoken, how do we do it? Do we pass a law to control them? Are they subject to our jurisdiction in that sense?.... Would he [Sen. Doolittle] think of punishing them for instituting among themselves their own tribal regulations?

====Children born to citizens of other countries====
The Fourteenth Amendment provides that children born in the United States become American citizens regardless of the citizenship of their parents.<ref name=Lee /> At the time of the amendment's passage, three Senators, including Trumbull, the author of the Civil Rights Act, as well as [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]], asserted that both the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment would confer citizenship on such children at birth, and no senator offered a contrary opinion.<ref name=trumbullcowan>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=070/llcg070.db&recNum=603 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 1, p. 498]. The debate on the Civil Rights Act contained the following exchange:<br>Mr. Cowan: "I will ask whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country?"<br>Mr. Trumbull: "Undoubtedly."<br>...<br>Mr. Trumbull: "I understand that under the naturalization laws the children who are born here of parents who have not been naturalized are citizens. This is the law, as I understand it, at the present time. Is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen? I am afraid we have got very few citizens in some of the counties of good old Pennsylvania if the children born of German parents are not citizens."<br>Mr. Cowan: "The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the fact. The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese; Germans are not Australians, nor Hottentots, nor anything of the kind. That is the fallacy of his argument."<br>Mr. Trumbull: "If the Senator from Pennsylvania will show me in the law any distinction made between the children of German parents and the children of Asiatic parents, I may be able to appreciate the point which he makes; but the law makes no such distinction; and the child of an Asiatic is just as much of a citizen as the child of a European."</ref><ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=073/llcg073.db&recNum=11 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, pp. 2891-2] During the debate on the Amendment, Senator [[John Conness]] of California declared, "The proposition before us, I will say, Mr. President, relates simply in that respect to the children begotten of Chinese parents in California, and it is proposed to declare that they shall be citizens. We have declared that by law [the Civil Rights Act]; now it is proposed to incorporate that same provision in the fundamental instrument of the nation. I am in favor of doing so. I voted for the proposition to declare that the children of all parentage, whatever, born in California, should be regarded and treated as citizens of the United States, entitled to equal Civil Rights with other citizens.".</ref><ref>[http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=1944 See veto message] by President Andrew Johnson.</ref> These congressional remarks applied to non-citizens lawfully present in the United States, as the problem of unauthorized immigration did not exist in 1866, and some scholars dispute whether the Citizenship Clause applies to unauthorized immigrants, although the law of the land continues to be based on the standard interpretation.<ref name=Lee>Lee, Margaret.  "[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33079.pdf Birthright Citizenship Under the 14th Amendment of Persons Born in the United States to Alien Parents]", [[Congressional Research Service]] (August 12, 2010): "Over the last decade or so, concern about illegal immigration has sporadically led to a re-
examination of a long-established tenet of U.S. citizenship, codified in the Citizenship Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and <U+00A7>301(a) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. <U+00A7>1401(a)), that a person who is born in the United States, subject
to its jurisdiction, is a citizen of the United States regardless of the race, ethnicity, or alienage of
the parents. [...] "some scholars argue that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment should not apply to the children of unauthorized aliens because the problem of unauthorized aliens did not exist at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was considered in Congress and ratified by the states."</ref> Congress during the 21st century has occasionally discussed revising the clause to reduce the practice of "[[birth tourism]]", in which a pregnant foreign national gives birth in the United States for purposes of the child's citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0810/14th-Amendment-why-birthright-citizenship-change-can-t-be-done|title=14th Amendment: why birthright citizenship change 'can't be done'|date=August 10, 2010|work=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=June 12, 2013|archivedate=June 12, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HKkZWGn2|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The clause's meaning with regard to a child of legal immigrants was tested in ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'' (1898).<ref>''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'' {{ussc|169|649|1898}}</ref> The Supreme Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, a man born within the United States to Chinese citizens who have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States and are carrying on business in the United States<U+2014>and whose parents were not employed in a diplomatic or other official capacity by a foreign power<U+2014>was a citizen of the United States.

====Loss of citizenship====
Loss of national citizenship is possible only under the following circumstances:
* Fraud in the [[naturalization]] process. Technically, this is not loss of citizenship but rather a voiding of the purported naturalization and a declaration that the immigrant ''never was'' a citizen of the United States.
* Voluntary relinquishment of citizenship. This may be accomplished either through renunciation procedures specially established by the State Department or through other actions that demonstrate desire to give up national citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_778.html|title=Advice about Possible Loss of U.S. Citizenship and Dual Nationality|last=U.S. Department of State|date=February 1, 2008|accessdate=April 17, 2009}}</ref>

For much of the country's history, voluntary acquisition or exercise of a foreign citizenship was considered sufficient cause for revocation of national citizenship.<ref>For example, see ''[[Perez v. Brownell]]'', {{ussc|356|44|1958}}, overruled by ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'', {{ussc|387|253|1967}}</ref> This concept was enshrined in a series of treaties between the United States and other countries (the [[Bancroft Treaties]]). However, the Supreme Court repudiated this concept in ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'' (1967),<ref>''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'', {{ussc|387|253|1967}}</ref> as well as ''[[Vance v. Terrazas]]'' (1980),<ref>''[[Vance v. Terrazas]]'', {{ussc|444|252|1980}}</ref> holding that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment barred the Congress from revoking citizenship.  However, a person can, of his own volition, constitutionally renounce his citizenship, and moreover Congress can revoke citizenship that it had previously granted to a person not born in the United States.<ref>Yoo, John.

===Privileges or Immunities Clause===
{{Main|Privileges or Immunities Clause}}
The Privileges or Immunities Clause, which protects the privileges and immunities of national citizenship from interference by the states, was patterned after the [[Privileges and Immunities Clause]] of Article IV,<ref>{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Raoul|title=Government by Judiciary : The Transformation of the Fourteenth Amendment|year=1997|publisher=Liberty Fund|location=Indianapolis|isbn=0865971447|page=58|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=675|edition=2nd ed.}}</ref> which protects the privileges and immunities of state citizenship from interference by other states.<ref name="Slaughter">''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'', {{ussc|83|36|1873}}</ref> In the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'' (1873),<ref name="Slaughter" /> the Supreme Court concluded that the Constitution recognized two separate types of citizenship<U+2014>"national citizenship" and "state citizenship"<U+2014>and the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause prohibits states from interfering only with privileges and immunities possessed by virtue of national citizenship.<ref name="Slaughter" /><ref name="Beatty">{{cite book |last=Beatty |first=Jack |title=Age of Betrayal: The Triumph of Money in America, 1865-1900 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=U3eG_QoBRzsC&pg=PA135&lpg=PA135&dq=%22To+Miller+the+first+sentence+of+the+Fourteenth%22#v=onepage&q=%22To%20Miller%20the%20first%20sentence%20of%20the%20Fourteenth%22 |accessdate=19 July 2013 |date=April 8, 2008 |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |isbn=1400032423 |page=135}}</ref> The Court concluded that the privileges and immunities of national citizenship included only those rights that "owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws."<ref name="Slaugher" /> The Court recognized few such rights, including access to seaports and navigable waterways, the right to run for federal office, the protection of the federal government while on the high seas or in the jurisdiction of a foreign country, the right to travel to the seat of government, the right to peaceably assemble and petition the government, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and the right to participate in the government's administration.<ref name="Slaughter" /><ref name="Beatty" /> This decision has not been overruled and has been specifically reaffirmed several times.<ref>e.g., ''[[United States v.

In ''[[Saenz v. Roe]]'' (1999),<ref>''Saenz v. Roe'', {{ussc|526|489|1999}}</ref> the Court ruled that a component of the "[[Freedom of movement|right to travel]]" is protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause:{{quote|Despite fundamentally differing views concerning the coverage of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, most notably expressed in the majority and dissenting opinions in the ''Slaughter-House Cases'' (1873), it has always been common ground that this Clause protects the third component of the right to travel. Writing for the majority in the ''Slaughter-House Cases'', Justice Miller explained that one of the privileges ''conferred by this Clause'' "is that a citizen of the United States can, of his own volition, become a citizen of any State of the Union by a bona fide residence therein, with the same rights as other citizens of that State." (emphasis added)}}
[[Samuel Freeman Miller|Justice Miller]] actually wrote in the ''Slaughter-House Cases'' that the right to become a citizen of a state (by residing in that state) "is conferred by ''the very article'' under consideration" (emphasis added), rather than by the "clause" under consideration.<ref name=Slaughter /><ref>Bogen, David.

In ''[[McDonald v.

===Due Process Clause===
{{Main|Due Process Clause}}
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies against only the states, but it is otherwise textually identical to the Due Process Clause of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]], which applies against the federal government; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines of [[procedural due process]] and [[substantive due process]].<ref name="constitutional-gov">{{cite book|last=Curry|first=James A.|title=Constitutional Government: The American Experience|year=2003|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company|isbn=0-7872-9870-0|page=210|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qWR3pvfyI1sC&pg=PA210&lpg=PA210&dq=two+Due+Process+Clauses+fifth+fourteenth+interpreted+identically&source=bl&ots=uzaCRH2D0N&sig=8QL3_GLOgj9fEVJsj86n66GxZx4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=AOHiUfqxAZX54AOmr4CAAQ&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=two%20Due%20Process%20Clauses%20fifth%20fourteenth%20interpreted%20identically&f=false|coauthors=Riley, Richard B.; Battiston, Richard M.|accessdate=14 July 2013|chapter=6}}</ref> Procedural due process is the guarantee of a fair legal process when the government seeks to burden{{Jargon-statement|date=July 2013}} a person's protected interests in life, liberty, or property, and substantive due process is the guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|year=2009|title=Due process|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of American Business|publisher=Infobase|last=Gupta|first=Gayatri|editor-last=Folsom|editor-first=W.

====Substantive due process====
{{main|Substantive due process}}
Beginning with ''[[Allgeyer v. Louisiana]]'' (1897),<ref>''[[Allgeyer v. Louisiana]]'', {{ussc|169|649|1897}}</ref> the Court interpreted the Due Process Clause as providing [[Substantive due process|substantive]] protection to private contracts and thus prohibiting a variety of social and economic regulation; this principle what was referred to as "[[freedom of contract]]".{{clarify|reason=clause missing a verb?|date=July 2013}}<ref name="Wests">{{Cite book|title=West's Encyclopedia of American Law|publisher=Thomson Gale|year=1998|chapter=Due Process of Law <U+2013> Substantive Due Process|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/6312/Due-Process-Law-Substantive-Due-Process.html}}</ref> Thus, the Court struck down a law decreeing maximum hours for workers in a bakery in ''[[Lochner v. New York]]'' (1905)<ref>''[[Lochner v. New York]]'', {{ussc|198|45|1905}}</ref> and struck down a minimum wage law in ''[[Adkins v. Children's Hospital]]'' (1923).<ref>''[[Adkins v.

However, the Court did uphold some economic regulation, such as state [[Prohibition in the United States#Development of the Prohibition movement|Prohibition]] laws (''[[Mugler v. Kansas]]'', 1887),<ref>''[[Mugler v. Kansas]]'', {{ussc|123|623|1887}}</ref> laws declaring maximum hours for mine workers (''[[Holden v. Hardy]]'', 1898),<ref>''[[Holden v.

New]]'', {{ussc|243|332|1917}}</ref> as well as federal laws regulating narcotics (''United States v. Doremus'', 1919).<ref>''United States v. Doremus'', {{ussc|249|86|1919}}</ref> The Court repudiated, but did not explicitly overrule, the "freedom of contract" line of cases in ''[[West Coast Hotel v. Parrish]]'' (1937).<ref>''[[West Coast Hotel v. Parrish]]'', {{ussc|300|379|1937}}</ref>

Although the "freedom of contract" has fallen into disfavor, by the 1960s, the Court had extended its interpretation of substantive due process to include other rights and freedoms that are not enumerated in the Constitution but that, according to the Court, extend or derive from existing rights.<ref name="Wests"/> For example, the Due Process Clause is also the foundation of a constitutional [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]]. The Court first ruled that privacy was protected by the Constitution in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965), which overturned a Connecticut law criminalizing [[birth control]].<ref>''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', {{ussc|381|479|1965}}</ref> While Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote for the majority that the right to privacy was found in the "penumbras" of various provisions in the Bill of Rights, Justices [[Arthur Goldberg]] and [[John Marshall Harlan II]] wrote in concurring opinions that the "liberty" protected by the Due Process Clause included individual privacy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001141.html |title=Griswold v. Connecticut |date=January 1, 2000 |work=Encyclopedia of the American Constitution |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}</ref>

The right to privacy was the basis for ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973),<ref>''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', {{ussc|410|113|1973}}</ref> in which the Court invalidated a Texas law forbidding abortion except to save the mother's life. Like Goldberg's and Harlan's concurring opinions in ''Griswold'', the majority opinion authored by Justice [[Harry A. Blackmun]] located the right to privacy in the Due Process Clause's protection of liberty. The decision disallowed many state and federal abortion restrictions, and it became one of the most controversial in the Court's history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425002190.html|title=Roe v.

====Procedural due process====
When the government seeks to burden{{Jargon-statement|date=July 2013}} a person's protected liberty interest or property interest, the Supreme Court has held that procedural due process requires that, at a minimum, the government provide the person notice, an opportunity to be heard at an oral hearing, and a decision by a neutral decisionmaker. For example, such process is due when a government agency seeks to terminate civil service employees, expel a student from public school, or cut off a welfare recipient's benefits.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Bradford|title=Procedural Due Process in Plain English|publisher=[[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]|year=2008|isbn=0-89133-573-0}}</ref><ref>See also ''[[Mathews v. Eldridge]]'' (1976).</ref>

The Court has also ruled that the Due Process Clause requires judges to [[Judicial disqualification|recuse]] themselves in cases where the judge has a [[conflict of interest]]. For example, in ''[[Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.]]'' (2009),<ref>''[[Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.]]'', {{ussc|556|___|2009}}</ref> the Court ruled that a justice of the [[Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia]] had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his campaign for election to that court.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124447000965394255.html|title=Justices Set New Standard for Recusals|last=Jess Bravin and Kris Maher|date=June 8, 2009|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=June 9, 2009}}</ref>

====Incorporation====
{{Main|Incorporation of the Bill of Rights}}
While many [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] are modeled after the United States Constitution and federal laws, those state constitutions did not necessarily include provisions comparable to the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. In ''[[Barron v. Baltimore]]'' (1833),<ref>''[[Barron v. Baltimore]]'', {{ussc|32|243|1833}}</ref> the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Bill of Rights restrained only the federal government, not the states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425000188.html|title=Barron v. City of Baltimore 7 Peters 243 (1833)|author=Levy, Leonard W.|work=Encyclopedia of the American Constitution|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> However, the Supreme Court has subsequently held that most provisions of the Bill of Rights apply to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment under a doctrine called "incorporation".<ref name="incorp" />

Whether incorporation was intended by the amendment's framers, such as John Bingham, has been debated by legal historians.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YoI14vYA8r0C&pg=PA145&dq=%22fourteenth+amendment%22+John+Bingham&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oUe6Uei9Cons8wTpq4HoBg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22fourteenth%20amendment%22%20John%20Bingham&f=false|year=2006|title=Bingham, John Armor|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties|publisher=CRC Press|last=Foster|first=James C.|editor-first=Paul|editor-last=Finkleman|pages=145}}</ref> According to legal scholar [[Akhil Reed Amar]], the framers and early supporters of the Fourteenth Amendment believed that it would ensure that the states would be required to recognize the same individual rights as the federal government; all of these rights were likely understood as falling within the "privileges or immunities" safeguarded by the amendment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Amar|first=Akhil Reed|year=1992|title=The Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment|journal=[[Yale Law Journal]]|volume=101|issue=6|pages=1193<U+2013>1284|doi=10.2307/796923|url=http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Amar1.html|jstor=796923|publisher=The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 101, No. 6}}</ref>

===Equal Protection Clause===
{{Main|Equal Protection Clause}}
[[File:BinghamFacingForward.jpg|thumb|Representative [[John Bingham]] of Ohio, principal author of the Equal Protection Clause]]

The Equal Protection Clause was created largely in response to the lack of equal protection provided by law in states with [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]]. Under Black Codes, blacks could not sue, give evidence, or be witnesses, and they received harsher degrees of punishment than whites.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|pp=20, 23&ndash;24}} The Clause mandates that individuals in similar situations be treated equally by the law.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|year=2009|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EHj_0R2rbxAC&pg=PA153&dq=%22Equal+Protection+Clause%22+encyclopedia&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JFG6UbaKI5TQ8wSGoYCABg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Equal%20Protection%20Clause%22%20encyclopedia&f=false|title =Equal protection of the laws|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of American Law|publisher=Infobase|last=Failinger|first=Marie|editor-first=David Andrew|editor-last=Schultz|pages=152&ndash;53}}</ref> Although the text of the Fourteenth Amendment applies the Equal Protection Clause only against the states, the Supreme Court, since ''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]'' (1954), has applied the Clause against the federal government through the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment under a doctrine called "reverse incorporation".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Primus|first=Richard|title=Bolling Alone|journal=Columbia Law Review|year=2004|month=May|url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=464847|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref><ref>''Bolling v.

In ''[[Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad]]'' (1886), the court reporter included a statement by Chief Justice [[Morrison Waite]] in the decision's headnote: 
<blockquote>"The court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the opinion that it does."<ref name="Johnson2001"/></blockquote>
This [[dictum]], which established that corporations enjoyed [[Corporate personhood|personhood]] under the Equal Protection Clause, was repeatedly reaffirmed by later courts.<ref name="Johnson2001">{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=John W.|title=Historic U.S. Court Cases: An Encyclopedia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XPDqMQv0Y6QC&pg=PA446|accessdate=June 13, 2013|date=January 1, 2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-93755-9|pages=446<U+2013>47}}</ref> It remained the predominant view throughout the twentieth century, though it was challenged in dissents by justices such as [[Hugo Black]] and [[William O.

In the decades following the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court overturned laws barring blacks from [[juries]] (''[[Strauder v. West Virginia]]'', 1880)<ref>''[[Strauder v. West Virginia]]'', {{ussc|100|303|1880}}</ref> or discriminating against [[Chinese American]]s in the regulation of laundry businesses (''[[Yick Wo v. Hopkins]]'', 1886),<ref>''[[Yick Wo v.

Ferguson]]'', {{ussc|163|537|1896}}</ref> the Supreme Court held that the states could impose [[racial segregation|segregation]] so long as they provided similar facilities<U+2014>the formation of the "[[separate but equal]]" doctrine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wwno/news.newsmain?action=article&ARTICLE_ID=1468970|title=Plessy/Ferguson plaque dedicated|last=Abrams|first=Eve|date=February 12, 2009|publisher=WWNO (University New Orleans Public Radio)|accessdate=April 17, 2009}}</ref> 

The Court went even further in restricting the Equal Protection Clause in ''[[Berea College v. Kentucky]]'' (1908),<ref>''[[Berea College v. Kentucky]]'', {{ussc|211|45|1908}}</ref> holding that the states could force private actors to discriminate by prohibiting colleges from having both black and white students. By the early 20th century, the Equal Protection Clause had been eclipsed to the point that Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] dismissed it as "the usual last resort of constitutional arguments."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0274_0200_ZO.html|title=274 U.S. 200: Buck v.

In ''[[Hernandez v.

==Apportionment of representation in House of Representatives==
Section 2 altered the way each state's representation in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] is [[Apportionment (politics)|determined]]. It counts all residents for apportionment, overriding [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Apportionment of Representatives and taxes|Article I, Section 2, Clause 3]] of the Constitution, which counted only [[Three-fifths compromise|three-fifths]] of each state's slave population.

Section 2 also reduces a state's apportionment if it wrongfully denies any adult male's right to vote, while explicitly permitting [[felony disenfranchisement]]. However, this provision was never enforced, and Southern states continued to use pretexts to prevent many blacks from voting until the passage of [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3444700477.html|title=Fourteenth Amendment|author=Friedman, Walter|date=January 1, 2006|work=Encyclopedia of African-American Culture and History|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=June 12, 2013}}</ref> Because it protects the right to vote only of adult males, not adult females, this clause is the only provision of the US Constitution to discriminate explicitly on the basis of sex.<ref name=Foner/>

Section 3 prohibits the election or appointment to any federal or state office of any person who had held any of certain offices and then engaged in insurrection, rebellion or [[Treason#United States|treason]].
