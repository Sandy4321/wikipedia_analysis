'''Richard Milhous <!--"Milhous" is the correct spelling-->Nixon''' (January 9, 1913 &ndash; April 22, 1994) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|37th]] [[President of the United States]] (1969<U+2013>1974) and the only president to ever resign the office. He was also the [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|36th]] [[Vice President of the United States]] (1953&ndash;1961).

Nixon was born in [[Yorba Linda, California|Yorba Linda]], [[California]]. In 1937 he graduated from [[Duke University School of Law]] and returned to California to practice law in [[La Mirada]]. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], he joined the [[United States Navy]] and rose to the rank of [[Lieutenant Commander]] during [[World War II]]. In 1946 he was elected as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] representing [[California's 12th Congressional district]], then in 1950 was elected to the [[United States Senate]]. He was chosen by Republican Party nominee [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to be his [[running mate]] in 1952 and served as vice president from 1953 until 1961. Despite announcing his retirement from politics after losing the 1960 [[United States presidential election, 1960|presidential election]] and 1962 [[California gubernatorial election, 1962|California gubernatorial election]], Nixon was [[United States presidential election, 1968|elected to the presidency]] in 1968.

The most immediate task facing President Nixon was the [[Vietnam War]]. He initially escalated the conflict, overseeing secret bombing campaigns, but soon withdrew American troops and successfully negotiated a ceasefire with [[North Vietnam]], effectively ending American involvement in the war. His foreign policy was largely successful; he opened relations with the [[People's Republic of China]] and initiated [[d<U+00E9>tente]] with the [[Soviet Union]]. Domestically, he implemented new economic policies which called for [[price controls|wage and price control]] and the abolition of the gold standard. He was [[United States presidential election, 1972|reelected by a landslide]] in 1972. In his second term, the nation was afflicted with economic difficulties. In the face of likely [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] for his role in the [[Watergate scandal]],<ref name=Goldwater1988_p353>[[Barry Goldwater|Goldwater, Barry]] and Jack Casserly (1988), p. 353</ref> Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974. His successor, [[Gerald Ford]], issued a [[pardon]] for any federal crimes Nixon may have committed while in office.

In his retirement, Nixon became a prolific author and undertook many foreign trips. Though far from universally popular, he gained respect as an elder statesman. He suffered a stroke on April 18, 1994 and [[Death and funeral of Richard Nixon|died four days later]], at the age of 81.

==Early life==
Richard Nixon was born on January 9, 1913 to [[Francis A. Nixon]] and [[Hannah Milhous|Hannah Milhous Nixon]] in a house his father had built in [[Yorba Linda, California|Yorba Linda]], [[California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/presidents/nixon_birthplace.html|title= Richard M.

His father converted from [[Methodism|Methodist]] to [[Quakerism]] after his marriage.<ref name=Black2007_p8>Black, Conrad (2007) p. 8</ref> Nixon had four brothers: [[Harold Nixon|Harold]] (1909&ndash;1933), [[Donald Nixon|Donald]] (1914&ndash;1987), [[Arthur Nixon|Arthur]] (1918&ndash;1925), and [[Edward Nixon|Ed]] (born 1930).<ref name="childhood">{{cite web|url=http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/thelife/childhood.php|title=Childhood|work=The Life|accessdate=2008-07-18|publisher=Richard Nixon Presidential Library}}</ref>

Nixon's early life was marked by hardships. Two of his brothers died before Richard was 21 and his family's ranch failed in 1922. The Nixons then moved to [[Whittier, California|Whittier]], [[California]], the home of his mother's relatives, where his father opened a [[grocery store]].<ref name="childhood"/>

Nixon initially attended [[Fullerton High School (California)|Fullerton High School]] in [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]], but later attended [[Whittier High School]], where he graduated second in his class in 1930. A lack of finances forced Nixon to decline a [[scholarship]] to [[Harvard University]]<ref name=NYT_Steel_19870426>{{cite news|author=Steel, Ronald |date=April 26, 1987 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/11/22/specials/ambrose-nixon.html |title=I Had to Win: Review of 'Nixon: The Education of a Politician 1913&ndash;1962,' by Stephen E.

Nixon was a formidable [[debate]]r, a stand out in collegiate drama productions, was elected student-body president, played [[American football|football]], basketball, and ran track.<ref name="st"/><ref name=Dallek2007_p8-9>Dallek, Robert (2007), pp. 8<U+2013>9</ref> While at Whittier, he lived at home and worked at his family's store;<ref name="st"/> he also taught [[Sunday school]] at East Whittier Friends Church, where he remained a member all his life.

(1990), p. 81</ref> and graduated third in his class in June 1937.<ref name="st"/>

==Law practice==
Although Nixon's first choice was to get a job with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], he returned to [[California]] and was admitted to the [[State Bar of California|Bar]] in 1937. He began working in the law offices of Wingert and Bewley,<ref name="st"/> where he worked on [[Commercial law|commercial litigation]] for local [[petroleum]] companies as well as on [[Will (law)|wills]] and other corporate matters. By his own admission Nixon would not work on [[divorce]] cases, saying that he was "severely embarrassed by women's confessions of sexual misconduct". Nixon found the job of a lawyer unexciting, but thought that it would gain him experience toward a future political career.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 39</ref> In 1938, he opened up his own branch of the law office in [[La Habra, California]],<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 44</ref> and the following year he became a full partner in the firm.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 43</ref>

==Marriage==
In January 1938 Nixon was cast in the Whittier Community Players production of ''[[The Dark Tower (play)|The Dark Tower]]''. There he played opposite a high school teacher named [[Pat Nixon|Thelma "Pat" Ryan]].<ref name="st"/><ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 40</ref> Nixon pursued her, but initially Pat was not interested in a relationship. He began dropping in on her at her house unannounced and would take her on Sunday drives to the Quaker Sunday School where he volunteered as the Sunday school teacher.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), pp. 43-45</ref> After several proposals Pat eventually agreed to marry the future president and they wed at a small ceremony on June 21, 1940.<ref name="st"/>

After a honeymoon in [[Mexico]], the Nixons moved to [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], then settled into an apartment in East Whittier a few months later.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 46</ref> In January 1942, the Nixons moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] where Richard took a job at the [[Office of Price Administration]].<ref name="st"/>

==World War II==
[[Image:Lt Cmdr Richard Nixon 1945.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant Commander Richard Nixon of the United States Navy, 1945]]
Nixon was eligible for a double exemption from military service, both as a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] with Quaker parents and through his job working for the OPA, but he soon left that post and was commissioned into the [[United States Navy]] in August 1942.<ref name="st"/> He received training at [[Naval Air Station Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]] and was assigned to [[Ottumwa Industrial Airport#History|Ottumwa Naval Air Station]], [[Iowa]], for seven months, before being reassigned as the naval passenger control officer for the [[South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command]], supporting the [[Military logistics|logistics]] of operations in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific theater]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq60-8.htm |title=Commander Richard M.

==Congressional career==
===House of Representatives===
[[Image:Nixon while in US Congress.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Nixon while serving in Congress]]
Soon after World War II ended  some [[Whittier, California|Whittier]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] approached Nixon about running for a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]].<ref name="con">{{cite web|url=http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/thelife/apolitician/thecongressman.php|title=The Congressman|work=The Life|accessdate=2008-07-18|publisher=Richard Nixon Presidential Library}}</ref> Nixon accepted, and defeated seven term [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent [[Jerry Voorhis]] in the November 1946 election to represent southern California's [[California's 12th congressional district|12th Congressional district]].<ref name="con"/> He helped finance the campaign with his World War II poker winnings.<ref name=Time_Scherer_20080702>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1819898,00.html|title=Candidates' Vices: Craps and Poker |date=July 2, 2008|last=Scherer |first=Michael |coauthor=Michael Weisskopf|accessdate=2008-09-30 |work=Time}}</ref>

In Congress, Nixon supported the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] of 1948, and served on the [[United States House Committee on Education and Labor|Education and Labor Committee]].<ref name="con"/> He was part of the Herter Committee, which went to [[Europe]] to prepare a preliminary report on the newly enacted [[Marshall Plan]].<ref name="con"/>

Nixon first gained national attention in 1948 when his investigation on the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) broke the impasse of the [[Alger Hiss]] spy case. Nixon believed [[Whittaker Chambers]]' allegations that Hiss, a high [[United States Department of State|State Department]] official, was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Espionage|spy]]. Nixon discovered Chambers saved [[Microform|microfilm]] reproductions of incriminating documents by hiding the film in a [[pumpkin]] (these became known as the "Pumpkin Papers").<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), pp. 129-135</ref> These documents were alleged both to be accessible only by Hiss, and to have been typed on Hiss's personal [[typewriter]]. Hiss was convicted of [[perjury]] in 1950 for statements he made to the HUAC. The discovery that Hiss, who had been an adviser to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], could have been a Soviet spy thrust Nixon into the public eye and made him a hero to many of Roosevelt's enemies, and an enemy to many of Roosevelt's supporters. In reality, his support for [[internationalism]] put him closer to the center of the Republican party. This case turned the young Congressman into a national, and controversial, figure.<ref name="con"/> Due to his popularity, Nixon was easily reelected in 1948.<ref name="con"/>

===Senate===
In the 1950 mid-term elections, Nixon challenged and defeated Democratic Representative [[Helen Gahagan|Helen Gahagan Douglas]] in an historic landslide to win a seat in the [[United States Senate]].<ref name="senate">{{cite web|url=http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/thelife/apolitician/thesenator.php|title=The Senator|work=The Life|accessdate=2008-07-18|publisher=Richard Nixon Presidential Library}}</ref> The campaign was very contentious. Nixon felt the former actress was a sympathizer to [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] causes and said she was "[[Pinko|pink]] right down to her underwear."<ref name="senate"/> Douglas responded by bestowing upon Nixon the nickname "[[List of United States Presidential names#Richard (Milhous) Nixon|Tricky Dick]]".<ref name="senate"/>

As a senator, Nixon took a prominent position in opposing global [[communism]]. He traveled frequently, speaking out against what he labeled as "the threat".<ref name="senate"/> He also criticized what he saw as President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s mishandling of the [[Korean War]].<ref name="senate"/> He supported statehood for both Alaska and Hawaii, voted in favor of civil rights, and favored disaster relief for both India and Yugoslavia.<ref name="cb178">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 178</ref> He voted against price and other controls, illegal immigration, and public power.<ref name="cb178"/>

==Vice Presidency (1953-1961)==
{{main|Eisenhower Administration}}
Due to his anti-communist stance, the 39-year-old Nixon was selected by Republican party nominee General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to be the Vice Presidential candidate at the [[1952 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in July 1952.<ref name="vp">{{cite web|url=http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/thelife/apolitician/thevicepresident.php|title=The Vice President|work=The Life|accessdate=2008-07-18|publisher=Richard Nixon Presidential Library}}</ref> In September, the ''[[New York Post]]'' produced an article claiming that campaign donors were buying influence with Nixon by providing him with a secret cash fund for his personal expenses.<ref name="vp"/> Nixon responded by saying that the fund was not secret and produced an independent audit showing that the funds were used only for political purposes.<ref name="vp"/>  Republicans, even those within Eisenhower's own campaign, pressured Eisenhower to remove Nixon from the ticket, but Eisenhower realized he would not win without Nixon.<ref name="eisenhower">{{cite web|url=http://www.eisenhowerinstitute.org/about/living_history/summer_1952.dot|title=Fifty Years Ago the Republicans Get Their Man: Summer 1952|author=Hovell, Bret|accessdate=2008-11-05|publisher=Eisenhower Institute at Gettysburg College}}</ref>

[[Image:Eisenhower 68-40-67.jpg|thumb|right|Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon at a campaign stop for the presidential election of 1952]]
Nixon appeared on television on September 23, 1952 to defend himself, in a [[Checkers speech|famous speech]]. He provided an independent third-party review of the fund's accounting, along with a personal summary of his finances,<ref name="vp"/> The speech became better known for its rhetoric, such as when he stated his wife Pat did not wear mink, but rather "a respectable Republican cloth coat," and that although he had been given an [[American Cocker Spaniel]] named Checkers in addition to his other campaign contributions, he was not going to give the dog back<ref name="vp"/> because his daughters loved it. This speech became known as the "Checkers speech." It resulted in much support from the Republican party base and from the general public,<ref>Drew, Elizabeth (2007), p. 15</ref> thus keeping him on the ticket.<ref name="vp"/> In the 1952 presidential elections, Eisenhower and Nixon defeated their opponents, [[Illinois]] Governor [[Adlai Stevenson]] and [[Alabama]] Senator [[John Sparkman]], by seven million votes.<ref name="vp"/> 

As Vice-President, Nixon expanded the office, making it an important and visible post.<ref name="vp"/><ref>Eisenhower, Dwight D. (1965), pp. 5-8</ref> Although he had little formal power, he had the attention of the media and the Republican Party. Using these, Nixon and Pat undertook many foreign trips of goodwill with the intent of garnering support for American policies during the [[Cold War]].<ref name="vp"/> On one such trip to [[Caracas, Venezuela|Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], anti-American [[protesters]] disrupted and assaulted Nixon's motorcade, injuring Venezuela's foreign minister.<ref name="vp"/> Nixon was lauded and attracted international media attention for his calm and coolness during the events.<ref name="vp"/>

In July 1959, President Eisenhower sent Nixon to the [[Soviet Union]] for [[Moscow]]'s opening of the American National Exhibition.<ref name="vp"/> On July 24, 1959, while touring the exhibits with [[Soviet]] leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]], they stopped at a model of an American kitchen and engaged in the impromptu "[[Kitchen Debate]]" about the merits of [[capitalism]] versus [[Communism]].<ref name="vp"/>

Nixon was the first Vice President to step in temporarily, and unofficially, to run the government. Nixon would conduct National Security meetings in the president's absence.<ref name="vp"/> Nixon also stepped in to the Senate to interpret [[filibuster]] rules in order to ensure the passing of Eisenhower's 1957 [[civil rights]] bill, which would create the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] and protect voting rights.<ref name="time 1957">{{cite news| title = A Hold Is Broken|work =Time| date = January 21, 1957| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,865640,00.html| accessdate = 2008-10-24}}</ref>

In [[U.S. presidential election, 1960|1960]], Nixon launched his campaign for President of the United States. He faced little competition in the Republican primaries, and chose former Massachusetts Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] as his running mate.<ref name="vp"/> His Democratic challenger was [[John F.

==Wilderness years==
[[Image:NixonPiano,1962.jpg|thumb|Nixon playing the piano, [[Beverly Hills, California]], 1962]]
Following his loss to Kennedy, Nixon and his family returned to California, where he practised law and wrote a bestselling book, ''Six Crises''.<ref name="vp"/> It recorded his political involvement as a [[United States House of Representatives|congressman]], [[United States Senate|senator]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] and used six different crises Nixon had experienced throughout his political career to illustrate his political [[memoir]]s.

In 1962, local and national Republican leaders encouraged Nixon to challenge the incumbent [[Pat Brown]] for [[Governor of California]].<ref name="vp"/> Despite initial reluctance, Nixon entered the race.<ref name="vp"/> The campaign was clouded by public suspicion that Nixon viewed the governorship as a political "stepping-stone" to a higher office, some opposition from the far-right of the party, and his own lack of interest in being California's governor.<ref name="vp"/> He [[California gubernatorial election, 1962|lost to Brown]] by nearly 300,000 votes.<ref name="vp"/> This loss was widely believed to be the end of his career;<ref name="vp"/> in an impromptu concession speech the morning after the election, Nixon famously blamed the media for favoring his opponent, saying, "You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference."<ref name="vp"/>The California defeat was highlighted in the November 11, 1962, episode of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Howard K.

The Nixon family traveled to Europe in 1963, and Nixon arranged to meet with the leaders of the countries he visited and give press conferences.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 446</ref> The family soon moved to [[New York City]], where Nixon became a senior [[Law firm#Partnership|partner]] in the leading law firm [[Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon|Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie & Alexander]].<ref name="vp"/> Though largely out of the public eye, Nixon was still supported by much of the Republican base who favored his knowledge of politics and international affairs.<ref name="vp"/> This reputation was enhanced when Nixon wrote an article in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' entitled "Asia After Vietnam",<ref name="vp"/> in which he proposed a new relationship with China.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 499</ref> He campaigned for Republican candidates in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1966|1966 Congressional elections]]<ref name="vp"/> and took an extended trip to South America and parts of the Middle East in 1967.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 496-497</ref>

Nixon waged a prominent television campaign, meeting with supporters in front of cameras.<ref name="cb513514">Black, Conrad (2007), pp. 513-514</ref> He stressed that the crime rate was too high, and attacked what he perceived as a surrender by the Democrats of the United States' nuclear superiority.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 550</ref> Nixon's campaign was aided by turmoil within the Democratic party:<ref name="pres"/> President [[Lyndon B.

====Vietnam War====
{{main|Vietnam War|Role of United States in the Vietnam War}}

As a result of the Vietnam War, 300 American soldiers were dying per week. The Johnson administration had negotiated a deal in which the U.S. would suspend bombing North Vietnam in exchange for unconditional negotiations, though this faltered. Nixon had to implement a new policy to chance securing South Vietnam as a state that was not communist, or withdraw American forces completely.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 569</ref>

Nixon approved a secret bombing campaign of North Vietnamese positions in [[Cambodia]] in March 1969<ref name="cb591">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 591</ref> (code-named ''[[Operation Menu]]'') to destroy what was believed to be the headquarters of the [[National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam]]. The Air Force considered the bombings a success.<ref name="cb591"/> Nixon then proposed simultaneous substantial withdrawals of North Vietnamese and American forces from South Vietnam one year after reaching a mutual agreement.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 612</ref>

In July 1969, the Nixons visited [[South Vietnam]], where Nixon met with President [[Nguyen Van Thieu]] and with U.S. military commanders. Amidst protests at home, the president implemented the [[Nixon Doctrine]], a strategy of replacing American troops with the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|Vietnamese troops]], also called "[[Role of United States in the Vietnam War#Vietnamization, 1969<U+2013>1975|Vietnamization]]."<ref name="pres"/> He soon enacted phased U.S. troop withdrawals<ref name="time 1971"/> but bombed [[Laos]], in part to interdict the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] that passed through Laos and Cambodia. Nixon's 1968 campaign promise to curb the war and his subsequent Laos bombing raised questions in the press about a "[[credibility gap]]," similar to that encountered earlier in the war by Lyndon B. Johnson.<ref name="time 1971">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,876891,00.html|work=Time|date=April 5, 1971|title=Again, the Credibility Gap?}}</ref> In a televised speech on April 30, 1970, Nixon announced the [[Cambodian Campaign|incursion of U.S. troops into Cambodia]] to disrupt so-called North Vietnamese sanctuaries. This led to protest and [[Student Strike of 1970|student strikes]] that temporarily closed 536 universities, colleges, and high schools.<ref>Dallek, Robert (2007), p. 203</ref>

Nixon formed the [[Conscription in the United States#End of conscription|Gates Commission]] to look into ending the [[Conscription in the United States|military service draft]],<ref name="aitken">Aitken, Jonathan (1996), pp. 396<U+2013>397</ref> implemented under President Johnson.

In December 1972, though very much concerned about the level of civilian casualties, Nixon approved ''[[Linebacker II]]'', the codename for aerial bombings of military and industrial targets in North Vietnam.<ref>{{cite news|author=Rosen, James|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=2008-12-22|title=Records Reveal Nixon's Conflict Over Vietnam War|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2008/12/03/records-reveal-nixons-conflict-vietnam-war/|date=December 3, 2008}}</ref> After much fighting, a peace treaty was signed in 1973.<ref name="scholastic">The Sixties (1994), p. 4</ref> Under President Nixon, American involvement in the war steadily declined from a troop strength of 543,000 to zero in 1973.<ref name="pres"/>

====Economy====
Under Nixon, direct payments from the federal government to individual American citizens rose from 6.3% GNP to 8.9% in government benefits including [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (U.S.)|Medicare]]. Food aid and public assistance also rose, beginning at $6.6 billion and escalating to $9.1 billion. Defense spending decreased from 9.1% to 5.8% GNP. The revenue sharing program pioneered by Nixon delivered $80 billion to individual states and municipalities.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 704</ref> 

Nixon enacted bold new economic policies, announcing them on August 15, 1971 in a televised speech to the nation. The Democratic Congress passed the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, giving Nixon power to set wages and prices; they did not believe he would use it and felt it would make him look indecisive.<ref name=Hetzel2008_p85>Hetzel, Robert L.

(2008), p. 86</ref> The limits did help to control wages, but not inflation.<ref name=Hetzel2008_p91>Hetzel, Robert L. (2008), p. 91</ref> Overall, however, the controls were viewed as successful in the short term<ref name=Hetzel2008_p92>Hetzel, Robert L. (2008), p. 92</ref> and were popular with the public, who felt Nixon was rescuing them from [[price gouging|price-gougers]] and from a foreign-caused exchange crisis.<ref name="pbs2"/><ref>Hetzel, Robert L. (2008), p. 84</ref> The next day, the [[Dow Jones]] measured a then-record one day increase.

Nixon was worried about the effects of increasing inflation and accelerating unemployment,<ref name="pbs2">{{cite news| last = Yergin| first = Daniel| coauthor = Joseph Stanislaw| title = Nixon Tries Price Controls | work = Commanding Heights| year = 1997| url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ess_nixongold.html| accessdate = 2008-11-02 }}</ref> thus he indexed Social Security for inflation, and created [[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI). In 1969, Nixon had presented the only balanced budget between 1961 and 1998.<ref>Frum, David (2000), p. 324</ref> However, despite speeches declaring an opposition to the idea, he decided to offer Congress a budget with [[deficit spending]] to reduce unemployment and declared, "[[We are all Keynesians now|Now I am a Keynesian]]."<ref name="pbs2"/> He also explored creating a universal minimum income and universal health care, but was not able to realize either.<ref name="domestic"/>

[[File:Richard Nixon candid in the Oval Office.jpg|thumb|right|Nixon in the Oval Office]]
Another large part of Nixon's plan was the detachment of the dollar from convertibility into gold.<ref name="cb740"/> By the time Nixon took office, U.S. gold reserves had declined from $25 billion to $10.5 billion. Gold was an underpriced commodity, as the dollar was overpriced as a currency. The United States was on the verge of running its first trade deficit in over 75 years.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 739</ref> 
The price of gold had been set at $35 an ounce since the days of [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s presidency; foreign countries acquired more dollar reserves, outnumbering the entire amount of gold the United States possessed. Nixon completely [[Nixon Shock|eradicated]] the [[gold standard]], preventing other countries from being able to claim gold in exchange for their dollar reserves, but also weakening the [[exchange rate]] of the dollar against other currencies and increasing inflation by driving up the cost of imports.<ref name="pbs2"/> Nixon felt that the dollar should float freely like other currencies.<ref name="cb741">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 741</ref> Said Nixon in his speech:
<blockquote>"The American dollar must never again be a hostage in the hands of international speculators.... Government... does not hold the key to the success of a people. That key... is in your hands. Every action I have taken tonight is designed to nurture and stimulate that competitive spirit to help us snap out of self-doubt, the self-disparagement that saps our energy and erodes our confidence in ourselves... Whether the nation stays Number One depends on your competitive spirit, your sense of personal destiny, your pride in your country and yourself."<ref name="Black, Conrad 2007, p. 743">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 743</ref></blockquote>

Other parts of the Nixon plan included a 10% investment tax credit being reimposed, assisting the automobile industry by removing excise taxes (provided the savings were passed directly to the consumer),<ref name="cb741"/> an end to fixed exchange rates, devaluation of the dollar on the free market, and a 10% tax on all imports into the U.S.<ref name="cb740"/> The U.S. economy was gradually transformed into tertiary industry; U.S. income rose, and unionization declined.<ref name="cb740"/>

Nixon wanted to lift the spirits of the country as polls showed increasing concern about the economy. His program was viewed by nearly everyone to be exceptionally bold, and astounded the Democrats.<ref name="Black, Conrad 2007, p. 743"/> Nixon soon experienced a bounce in the polls.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 744.</ref> His economic program was determined to be a clear success by December 1971.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 760</ref> One of Nixon's economic advisers, [[Herbert Stein]], wrote: "Probably more new regulation was imposed on the economy during the Nixon administration than in any other presidency since the [[New Deal]]."<ref name="pbs2"/>

====Civil rights====
The Nixon years witnessed the first large-scale integration of public schools in the South.<ref>Boger, John Charles (2005), p. 6</ref> Strategically, Nixon sought a middle way between the [[Racial segregation|segregationist]] [[George C. Wallace]] and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern white Democrats.

Nixon tied desegregation to improving the quality of education<ref name="cb644">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 644</ref> and enforced the law after the Supreme Court, in ''[[Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education]]'' (1969), prohibited further delays.

====U.S. space program====
[[Image:Apollo 11 crew in quarantine.jpg|thumb|Nixon visits the ''Apollo 11'' astronauts in quarantine.]]
In 1969, Nixon's first year in office, the United States sent three men up to the moon, becoming the first nation in the world to do so. On July 20, Nixon addressed [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]], two of the astronauts, live via radio during their historic [[Apollo 11|Apollo 11 moonwalk]].

====Indo-Pakistani War====
{{main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1971}}

A conflict broke out in Pakistan in 1971 following independence demonstrations in East Pakistan; President [[Yahya Khan]] instructed the Pakistani Army to quell the riots, resulting in widespread [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities|human rights abuses]]. President Nixon liked Yahya personally, and credited him for helping to open a channel to China, thus Nixon felt obligated to support him in the struggle.<ref name="cb750">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 750</ref> But there were limits as to how far the United States could associate itself with Pakistan due to human rights abuse.<ref name="cb750"/> American public opinion was concerned with the atrocities<ref name=Thornton1989_pp113-115>Thornton, Richard C.

Nixon relayed messages to Yahya, urging him to restrain Pakistani forces.<ref name="cb751">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 751</ref> His objective was to prevent a war and safeguard Pakistan's interests, though he was also fearful of an Indian invasion of West Pakistan that would lead to Indian domination of [[Indian subcontinent|the sub-continent]] and strengthen the position of the [[Soviet Union]],<ref name=Time_19720117>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877618-2,00.html|title=The Kissinger Tilt|work=Time|date=January 17, 1972|accessdate=2008-09-30}}</ref> which had recently signed a [[Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation|cooperation treaty]] with India.

====China====

[[Image:Nixon shakes hands with Chou En-lai.jpg|thumb|right|President Nixon shakes hands with Chinese Premier Chou En-lai upon arriving in Beijing.]]

[[International relations|Relations]] between the Western powers and [[Eastern Bloc]] changed dramatically in the early 1970s. In 1960, the People's Republic of China publicly split from its main ally, the [[Soviet Union]], in the [[Sino-Soviet Split]]. As tension along the border between the two communist nations [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|reached its peak]] in 1969 and 1970, Nixon decided to use their conflict to shift the balance of power towards the West in the [[Cold War]].<ref>Dallek, Robert (2007), p. 144</ref>

Nixon had begun entreating China a mere month into office by sending covert messages of rapprochement through third-party nations such as Romania and Pakistan.<ref name="fapbs"/> He reduced many trade restrictions between the two countries, and silenced anti-China voices within the White House. By January 1970, the two nations began secret discussions in Warsaw, Poland, though the Chinese cancelled these.<ref name="fapbs">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/37_nixon/nixon_foreign.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2009-01-11|title=Foreign Affairs, Richard M.

In April 1971, the Chinese table tennis team invited the American table tennis team to attend a demonstration competition for a week in China.<ref name="cb712713">Black, Conrad (2007), pp. 712-713</ref> Unbeknownst to the Americans, the invitation came upon the order of [[Mao Tse-Tung]] himself, who had taken note of Nixon's "subtle overtures" to improve U.S.-Chinese relations, including the conflict in Pakistan.<ref name="cb712713"/> This was significant in that the fifteen-member table tennis team were the first Americans to enter China in more than twenty years<ref name="cb712713"/> (the term "[[ping pong diplomacy]]" arose from this encounter).<ref>Dallek, Robert (2007), p. 268</ref> 

Chinese Premier [[Chou En-lai]], through the Pakistani ambassador, had relayed a message to Nixon reading, "The Chinese government reaffirms its willingness to receive publicly in Peking a special envoy of the president of the United States, or the U.S. secretary of state, or even the president himself."<ref name="cb716">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 716</ref> Nixon sent then-National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]] on a secret mission to China in July 1971 to arrange a visit by the president and first lady.<ref name="cb716"/> Soon, the world was stunned to learn that Nixon intended to visit Communist China the following year.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 717</ref>

In February 1972, President and Mrs. Nixon [[Nixon visit to China 1972|traveled to China]],  where the president was to engage in direct talks with Mao and Chou. Kissinger briefed Nixon for over forty hours.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 778</ref> Upon touching down, Nixon and Pat emerged from Air Force One and greeted Chou. According to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose:
<blockquote>"[Nixon] knew that when his old friend John Foster Dulles had refused to shake the hand of Chou En-lai in Geneva in 1954, Chou had felt insulted. He knew too that American television cameras would be at the Peking airport to film his arrival. A dozen times on the way to Peking, Nixon told Kissinger and Secretary of State William Rogers that they were to stay on the plane until he had descended the gangway and shaken Chou En-lai<U+2019>s hand. As added insurance, a Secret Service agent blocked the aisle of Air Force One to make sure the president emerged alone."<ref name="china trip">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/china/sfeature/nixon.html|title=The Nixon Visit - (February 21-28, 1972)|accessdate=2009-01-06|publisher=PBS|date=1999}}</ref></blockquote> Over one hundred television journalists accompanied the president. On Nixon's orders, television was strongly favored over printed publications, as television would capture the trips visuals much better while snubbing the print journalists Nixon despised.<ref name="china trip"/>

Nixon and Kissinger were soon summoned to an hour long meeting with Mao and Chou, at Mao's official private residence, where they discussed a range of issues.<ref name="cb780782">Black, Conrad (2007), pp. 780-782</ref> Mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by Nixon, who was forthright, unlike the leftists and the Soviets.<ref name="cb780782"/> He also said he was suspicious of Kissinger<ref name="cb780782"/> while the National Security Advisor referred to their meeting as his "encounter with history."<ref name="china trip"/> A formal banquet welcoming the presidential party was conducted that evening in the [[Great Hall of the People]].

====Soviet Union====
Nixon used the improving international environment to address the topic of nuclear peace. Following his successful visit to China, the Nixon administration drew up plans for the president to visit the Soviet Union. The President and First Lady arrived in Moscow on May 22, 1972.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/22/newsid_4373000/4373149.stm|title=1972: President Nixon arrives in Moscow|date=May 22, 1972|accessdate=2009-01-08|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

[[Image:Leonid Brezhnev and Richard Nixon talks in 1973.png|thumb|right|Nixon meets with Brezhnev during the Soviet Leader's trip to the U.S. in 1973]]
Nixon met with Soviet Leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], and engaged in intense negotiations regarding international issues<ref name="bbc"/>  with his Soviet counterpart.<ref name="pres"/> out of this "summit meeting" came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties: [[SALT I]], the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers,<ref name="pres"/> and the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]], which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles. Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of "peaceful coexistence" and established groundbreaking new policy of ''[[d<U+00E9>tente]]'' (or cooperation) between the two superpowers. ''D<U+00E9>tente'' would replace the hostility of the Cold War and the two countries would live mutually. A banquet was held that evening at the [[Kremlin]].<ref name="bbc"/>

Nixon extended the [[Nixon Doctrine]] from Vietnam to his policy toward the Soviet Union, believing that helping [[Iran]] become stronger would check the Soviets' power.<ref name="time 2007">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1574151,00.html?iid=sphere-inline-bottom|author=Beinart, Peter|title=Return of the Nixon Doctrine|date=January 4, 2007|work=Time}}</ref> To win American friendship, both China and the Soviet Union cut back on their diplomatic support for North Vietnam and advised Hanoi to come to terms.<ref name=Gaddis1982_p294p299>Gaddis, John Lewis (1982), pp. 294, 299</ref><ref name=Guan2003_pp>Guan, Ang Cheng (2003), pp. 61, 69, 77<U+2013>79</ref><ref name=Zhai_p136>Zhai, Qiang (2000), p. 136</ref> Nixon laid out his strategy:
<blockquote>I had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in Vietnam was to enlist, if possible, the help of the Soviets and the Chinese. Though rapprochement with China and d<U+00E9>tente with the Soviet Union were ends in themselves, I also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war. At worst, Hanoi was bound to feel less confident if Washington was dealing with Moscow and Beijing. At best, if the two major Communist powers decided that they had bigger fish to fry, Hanoi would be pressured into negotiating a settlement we could accept.<ref name=Nixon1987_pp105-6>Nixon, Richard (1987), pp. 105<U+2013>106</ref></blockquote>

Having made great progress over the last two years in U.S.-Soviet relations, Nixon planned a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1973.<ref name="cb963">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 963</ref> He arrived in Moscow on June 27 to a welcome ceremony, cheering crowds, and a state dinner at the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] that evening.<ref name="cb963"/> Nixon and Brezhnev met in Yalta, where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact, d<U+00E9>tente, and MIRVs.

====1972 presidential campaign====
{{main|United States presidential election, 1972}}
Nixon entered his name on the New Hampshire primary ballot on January 5, 1972, effectively announcing his reelection campaign.<ref name="cb766">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 766</ref> Nixon had expected to run against Senator [[Ted Kennedy]],<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 617</ref> though Senator [[Edmund Muskie]] soon became the front runner of the Democrats, with Senator [[George McGovern]] in a close second place.<ref name="cb766"/> Governor [[George Wallace]] soon entered the race as well; popular in Florida, he would create havoc among the Democrats and boost Nixon's campaign.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 768-769</ref> 

[[Image:Nixon campaigns.jpg|thumb|left|Nixon campaigns during the 1972 presidential campaign]]
Prominent issues of the early campaign included school busing and heated relations between the three branches of the government. Nixon defeated Congressman [[Paul McCloskey]] and Congressman [[John Ashbrook]] with 70% of the vote in the March New Hampshire primary, and later won Florida with 87% of the vote (though McCloskey had withdrawn).<ref name="cb795"/> This largely assured him the Republican nomination.<ref name="cb795"/> On the Democratic side in New Hampshire, Muskie defeated McGovern the primary 48% to 37%.<ref name="cb795"/> McGovern did not campaign in Florida, receiving only 5% of its electorate, while Wallace took 42% of the vote in a field of ten opponents.<ref name="cb795"/> Muskie received 14%, effectively ending his campaign.<ref name="cb795">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 795</ref>

Nixon addressed the nation on March 16 about the school busing issue, reiterating that it was wrong to force a child onto a school bus and that busing lowered the quality of education.<ref name="cb795"/> He announced the Equal Education Opportunities bill that would seek a moratorium on local school busing.<ref name="cb796"/> The bill passed and the poorest school districts were slowly improved.<ref name="cb796">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 796</ref> Vietnam was still ongoing, though Nixon had reduced troop levels dramatically.

Meanwhile, George Wallace was shot on May 15; though he recovered, he was confined to a wheelchair. He then won absolute majorities in several other primaries, placing him well ahead of other candidates.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 806</ref> McGovern, however, chaired a commission that allocated delegates based off of an affirmative action plan, giving fixed weight to ethnic groups and [[gerrymandered]] the convention for himself.<ref name="cb796"/> On June 10, McGovern won the California primary and secured the Democratic nomination.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 816</ref>

That August, Nixon was renominated at the [[1972 Republican National Convention]]. He dismissed the Democratic platform as cowardly and divisive.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 834</ref> Nixon was shown to be ahead in most polls for the entire election cycle, and was reelected that November in one of the biggest landslide election victories in U.S. political history. He defeated McGovern and garnered over 60% of the popular vote. He carried 49 of the 50 states, losing only in [[Massachusetts]] and the [[District of Columbia]].<ref>Herbers, John (November 8, 1972), ''New York Times''Page 35,</ref>

===Second term===
[[Image:Nixon 1973 inauguration.jpg|thumb|right|Nixon is sworn in for a second term in 1973.]]
On October 10, 1973, Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] resigned amid charges of bribery, tax evasion and money laundering during his previous tenure as Maryland's governor. Nixon chose Representative [[Gerald Ford]], Republican Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, to replace Agnew.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DEEDE1E3AF93BA2575AC0A960958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 |title=Spiro T.

====Continuation of economic changes====
After he won reelection, Nixon found that inflation was increasing, and the legislation authorizing price controls expired April 30, 1973. The [[Senate Democratic Caucus]] recommended a 90-day freeze on all profits, interest rates, and prices.<ref name=Hetzel2008_p92/> Nixon re-imposed price controls in June 1973, echoing his 1971 plan, as food prices rose; this time, he focused on [[agriculture|agricultural]] exports and limited the freeze to 60 days.<ref name=Hetzel2008_p92/>

The price controls became unfavorable with the public and with businesspeople, who saw powerful [[labor union]]s as preferable to the price board bureaucracy.<ref name=Hetzel2008_p92/> Business owners, however, now saw the controls as permanent rather than temporary, and voluntary compliance decreased.<ref name=Hetzel2008_p92/> The controls produced [[food shortage]]s, as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss.<ref name=Hetzel2008_p92/> The controls were slowly ended, and by April 30, 1974, the control authority from Congress had lapsed.<ref name=Hetzel2008_p92/> However, the controls on oil and natural gas prices persisted for a few years.<ref name="pbs2"/> Nixon also dramatically increased spending on federal employees' salaries while the economy was plagued by the [[1973<U+2013>1974 stock market crash]].<ref name="civil servants">{{cite web| last = Nixon| first = Richard| title = 428 - Message to the Congress on Federal Civilian and Military Pay Increases| date = December 15, 1972| work = American Presidency Project| url = http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=3717| accessdate =2008-11-05}}</ref>

====Yom Kippur War and 1973 oil crisis====
[[Israel]], a powerful American ally in the [[Middle East]], was supported by the Nixon administration during the [[Yom Kippur War]]. When an [[Arab]] coalition led by [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]]<U+2014>allies to the Soviets<U+2014>attacked in October 1973, Israel suffered initial losses and pressed European powers for help, but (with the notable exception of the [[Netherlands]]) the Europeans responded with inaction. Nixon cut through inter-departmental squabbles and bureaucracy to initiate an airlift of American arms. By the time the U.S. and the Soviet Union negotiated a truce, Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory. A long-term effect was the movement of [[Egypt]] away from the Soviets toward the U.S. But the victory for its ally and the support provided to them by the U.S. came at the cost of the [[1973 oil crisis]]; the members of [[OPEC]] decided to raise oil prices in response to the American support of Israel.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-01-15|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/dr/96057.htm |title=Second Arab Oil Embargo, 1973-1974|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}</ref>

After [[Nixon Shock|Nixon chose to go off]] the [[gold standard]], foreign countries increased their currency reserves in anticipation of currency fluctuation, which caused deflation of the dollar and other world currencies. Since oil was paid for in dollars, OPEC was receiving less value for their product. They cut production and announced price hikes and an [[embargo]] targeted at the United States and the Netherlands, specifically blaming U.S. support for Israel in the Yom Kippur War for the actions.<ref name=IndependentReview_Hammes_2005>{{cite journal|author=Hammes, David and Douglas Wills|title=Black Gold: The End of Bretton Woods and the Oil-Price Shocks of the 1970s|journal=The Independent Review |volume=IX |isssue=4|date=Spring 2005|pages=501<U+2013>511|accessdate=2009-01-15}}</ref>

On January 2, 1974, Nixon signed a bill that lowered the [[National Maximum Speed Law|maximum U.S. speed limit]] to 55&nbsp;miles per hour (90 [[kilometers per hour|km/h]]) in order to conserve [[gasoline]] during the [[1973 energy crisis]].<ref>''The New York Times''.

The term ''Watergate'' has come to encompass an array of illegal and secret activities undertaken by the Nixon administration. The activities came to light in the aftermath of five men being caught breaking into Democratic party headquarters at the [[Watergate complex|Watergate Hotel]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on June 17, 1972.<ref name="gate1">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/watergate/part1.html|title=The Post Investigates|accessdate=2008-12-31|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> The ''Washington Post'' picked up on the story, while reporters [[Carl Bernstein]] and [[Bob Woodward]] relied on an FBI informant known as "[[Deep Throat]]" to link the men to the Nixon White House.<ref name="gate1"/> This became one of a series of scandalous acts involving the [[Committee to Re-Elect the President]].<ref name="gate1"/> Nixon downplayed the scandal as mere politics, and his White House denounced the story as biased and misleading.<ref name="gate1"/> As the FBI eventually confirmed that Nixon aides had attempted to sabotage the Democrats, many began resigning and senior aides faced prosecution.<ref name="gate1"/>

Nixon's alleged role in ordering a cover-up came to light after the testimony of John Dean.<ref name="gate2">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/watergate/part2.html|title=The Government Acts|accessdate=2008-12-31|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> In July 1973, White House aide Alexander Butterfield testified that Nixon had a secret taping system that recorded his conversations and phone calls in the Oval Office.<ref name="gate2"/> Unlike the tape recordings by earlier Presidents, Nixon's were [[subpoena]]ed.

The gap, while not conclusive proof of wrong-doing on the part of the President, cast doubt on Nixon's claim that he was unaware of the cover-up.<ref name="'70s">Frum, David (2000), p. 26</ref>

Though Nixon lost much popular support, including from some in his own party, he rejected accusations of wrongdoing and vowed to stay in office.<ref name="gate2"/> Nixon insisted that he had made mistakes, but had no prior knowledge of the burglary, did not break any laws, and did not learn of the coverup until early 1973.<ref name="gate3">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/watergate/part3.html|title=Nixon Resigns|accessdate=2008-12-31|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> On November 17, 1973, during a televised question and answer session with the press,<ref name="'70s"/> Nixon said, {{cquote|People have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.

In April 1974, Nixon announced the release of 1200 transcript pages of White House conversations between him and his aides.<ref name="gate3"/> Despite this, the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]], controlled by Democrats, opened impeachment hearings against the President on May 9, 1974.<ref name="gate3"/> On July 24, the Supreme Court then ruled that the tapes must be released to Jaworski; one of the secret recordings, known as the [[Watergate tapes#The "Smoking Gun" tape|Smoking Gun]] tape, was released on August 5, 1974, and revealed that Nixon knew of the cover-up from its inception and had administration officials try to stop the [[FBI]]'s investigation.<ref name="'70s"/> In light of his loss of political support and the near certainty of impeachment, Nixon resigned the office of the presidency on August 9, 1974, after addressing the nation on television the previous evening.<ref name="gate3"/>{{Audio|Nixon_Resign.ogg|listen}} He never admitted to criminal wrongdoing, although he conceded errors of judgment.

Following his resignation, Nixon and Pat returned to their home [[La Casa Pacifica]] in [[San Clemente, California]].<ref name="ll">{{cite web|url=http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/thelife/postpresidency.php|title=Post Presidency|work=The Life|accessdate=2008-07-18|publisher=Richard Nixon Presidential Library}}</ref> He was said to be in seclusion for a number of days in his home, first experiencing shock and later persistent sadness.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 987</ref> On September 8, 1974, President Ford granted a "full, free, and absolute pardon" to former President Nixon. This ended any possibility of an indictment. Nixon then released a statement: 
<blockquote>"I was wrong in not acting more decisively and forthrightly in dealing with Watergate.... No words can describe the depths of my regret and pain at the anguish of my mistakes over Watergate have caused the nation and presidency, a nation I so deeply love and an institution I so greatly respect."<ref name="cb990">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 990</ref></blockquote>
Within one month, President Ford's approval rating dropped from 70% to 50%.<ref name="cb990"/> Nixon later told a former aide that he felt he was chased out of office by the establishment in Washington and the establishment soft left in the media, as they considered him a mortal threat to their domination of national affairs.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 993</ref>

As a result of Watergate, Nixon was disbarred by the State of New York. He had attempted to resign his license, but the State refused to let him do so unless he admitted wrongdoing in Watergate.<ref name=HistoryChannel_Watergate>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-01-11|url=http://www.history.com/exhibits/impeach/whthous1.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071028075731/http://www.history.com/exhibits/impeach/whthous1.html|archivedate=2007-10-28|title=Richard M. Nixon: Before and After Watergate|publisher=The History Channel}}</ref> He later resigned his other law licenses.

The evening of the pardon, Nixon experienced great pain in his lower left abdomen and his left leg had swollen to three times its normal size.<ref name="cb992">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 992</ref> His doctor, John Lungren, was summoned from Long Beach Memorial Hospital. He prescribed massive doses of medication and instructed Nixon not to put pressure on his leg.<ref name="cb992"/> He was advised to check into a hospital, though he was adamant in his refusal to do so.<ref name="cb992"/> Lungren returned to Nixon's house eight days later and found that his condition had deteriorated.<ref name="cb994">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 994</ref> Told that he would surely die if he did not go to a hospital, Nixon relented.<ref name="cb994"/> It was discovered that a clot from his leg had broken off and part had traveled to his lung; to treat this, he was placed on an anti-coagulant intravenous machine.<ref name="cb994"/> Pat sat with him for five days, sleeping only occasionally, and he was out of the hospital on October 4.<ref name="cb994"/>

On October 23, Nixon was taken back to the hospital as swelling had begun again. Doctors found serious vascular blockages and a danger of gangrene;<ref name="cb996">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 996</ref> it was feared that blood clots may break loose and travel to the heart or brain.<ref name="cb996"/> An eighteen inch blood clot, one of the largest ever detected, was found in a vein leading to Nixon's heart.<ref name="cb996"/> Surgery was deemed necessary for his survival; he underwent a ninety-minute operation on October 29.<ref name="cb996"/> While recuperating, Nixon fainted, fell out of bed, and fell into a coma.<ref name="cb997">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 997</ref> He underwent four blood transfusions in three hours, suffered severe internal bleeding, and an extremely low blood pressure.<ref name="cb997"/> Pat and his daughters stayed by his side, while he was visited by President Ford and telephoned by Mao Tse-Tung.<ref name="cb997"/> He returned home on November 14.

[[Image:Four Presidents.jpg|thumb|left|Nixon joins Presidents Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter at the White House, 1981]]
By the spring of 1975, Nixon's mental and physical health was improving. He maintained an office in a Coast Guard station 300 yards from his home, first taking a golf cart and later walking the route each day; he mainly worked on his memoirs.<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 1002</ref> Nixon traveled extensively, both domestically and internationally. He undertook trips to [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]], Russia, [[Africa]], and [[Asia]].<ref name="ll"/> At the invitation of Mao Tse-Tung, Nixon traveled to China in February 1976.<ref name="cb10051006"/> His trip was initially criticized, including by some within his own party, who argued that citizen-Nixon was conducting U.S. foreign policy.<ref name="cb10051006"/> The well-publicized trip was deemed a success, however; upon his return, Nixon prepared a lengthy memorandum on his experiences that was sent to the White House.<ref name="cb10051006">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 1005-1006</ref> He would visit China four additional times after this.

By 1977, Nixon began forming a public-relations comeback effort. He met with British commentator [[David Frost]] that August, who paid him six hundred thousand dollars for [[The Nixon Interviews|a series]] of sit-down interviews.<ref name="cb1004"/> They began on the topic of foreign policy, recounting the leaders he had known, but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on Watergate. He admitted that the he had let down the country and said, "I did abuse the power I had as president."<ref name="ed138"/> He said that at the time of his resignation, he was crippled and that "I said things that were not true." He revealed, "I brought myself down. I gave them a sword and they stuck it in. And they twisted it with relish. And, I guess, if I'd been in their position, I'd have done the same thing."<ref name="ed138"/> Nixon did not admit to criminal wrongdoing, denied criminal intent,<ref name="cb1011">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 1011</ref> and denied authorizing payment to the burglars as an incentive for them not to reveal information.<ref name="cb1011"/> He was criticized at the time by some who opined that Nixon should not be giving information to Frost that he had declined to give to federal courts.<ref name="cb1004">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 1004</ref> Nonetheless, the interviews became well known and were viewed widely across the world.<ref name="ed138">Drew, Elizabeth (2007), p. 138</ref> The encounters were the subject of the 2008 film ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]''.

He soon published his memoirs: ''RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon''. This was the first of ten books he was to author in his retirement,<ref name="ll"/> and it enabled Nixon to emerge from his seclusion and partake in book tours.

The Nixons moved to [[New York City]] in 1980, and [[Saddle River, New Jersey]] in 1981.<ref name="ll"/> He maintained a routine schedule of speaking engagements and writing.<ref name="ll"/> In 1981, he joined former Presidents Ford and [[Jimmy Carter]] as representatives of the United States at the funeral of Egyptian President [[Anwar al-Sadat]].<ref name="ll"/> He later embarked on journeys to Japan, China, and the Soviet Union.<ref name="ll"/> On his return from the Soviet Union trip, Nixon sent President [[Ronald Reagan]] a lengthy memorandum that contained foreign policy suggestions and his personal impressions of Gorbachev.<ref name="ll"/> Following this trip, Nixon was ranked by Gallup as one of the ten most admired men in the world.<ref name="ed142"/>

In 1986, Nixon gave an address to a convention of newspaper publishers, impressing his audience with his ''tour d'horizon'' of the world.<ref name="ed144">Drew, Elizabeth (2007), p. 144</ref> Author Elizabeth Drew wrote that "even when he was wrong, Nixon still showed that he knew a great deal and had a capacious memory as well as the capacity to speak with apparent authority, enough to impress people who had little regard for him in earlier times."<ref name="ed144"/> ''Newsweek'', among other news publications,<ref name="ed142">Drew, Elizabeth (2007), p. 142</ref> ran a story on "Nixon's comeback" with the headline "He's back."<ref name="ed144"/> He gained respect as an elder statesman<ref name="ll"/> in the area of foreign affairs, being consulted by both Republican and Democratic successors to the presidency; Reagan sought Nixon's advice in dealing with Soviet Leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 1039</ref>

[[File:Richard and Pat Nixon 1990.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Richard and Pat Nixon in 1990]]
On July 19, 1990, the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in [[Yorba Linda, California]] opened as a private institution, with Nixon and Pat in attendance. They were joined by a throng of people, including Gerald Ford, Reagan, and [[George H. W. Bush]], and their spouses [[Betty Ford|Betty]], [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]], and [[Barbara Bush|Barbara]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nixonfoundation.org/index.php?src=directory&srctype=display&id=831&view=products_detail|title=The Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace Foundation: Museum store}}</ref> The property was owned and operated by a private foundation and was not part of the [[National Archives]]' presidential libraries system until July 11, 2007, when the [[Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum]] was officially welcomed into the federal presidential library system. In January 1991  the former president founded the [[Nixon Center]], a policy [[think tank]] and conference center.<ref>{{cite paper|author=McGann, James G.|title=The Global "Go-To Think Tanks": The Leading Public Policy Research Organizations in the World|pages=p. 18|publisher=Foreign Policy Research Institute|year=2007|url=http://www.fpri.org/research/thinktanks/mcgann.globalgotothinktanks.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-09-29}}</ref>

Pat Nixon died on June 22, 1993 of health problems, including [[emphysema]] and [[lung cancer]]. Her funeral services were held on the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace during the week until her burial on June 26. Richard Nixon was deeply distraught, and broke down in convulsive sobs for the only time in his adult life.<ref name="cb104950">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 1049-1050</ref> Inside the building, he delivered a tribute to her.<ref name="cb104950"/> Nixon was comforted by his family while former presidents [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] and their wives attended the ceremony.<ref>''New York Times (June 23, 1993) "Pat Nixon Dies of Lung Cancer at age 81" pg. 1</ref><ref name="PN funeral">{{cite web |url=http://www.nixonfoundation.org/index.php?src=gendocs&link=PNfuneral|title=Funeral Services of Mrs. Nixon|accessdate= 2007-10-02|year= 2005|publisher= Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace Foundation}}</ref> Some commented that without Pat, Nixon would not "last a year."<ref name="cb104950"/>

==Death and funeral==
{{main|Death and funeral of Richard Nixon}}
Nixon suffered a severe [[stroke]] at 5:45 p.m. EDT on Monday, April 18, 1994, while preparing to eat dinner in his [[Park Ridge, New Jersey]] home.<ref name="death-wapo">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2002/06/11/AR2005112200809.html|title=Richard M. Nixon, 37th President, Dies|accessdate=2008-07-18|work=The Washington Post|date=April 23, 1994|author=Weil, Martin and Eleanor Randolph|page= A01}}</ref> It was determined that a blood clot resulting from his heart condition had formed in his upper heart, then broken off and traveled to his brain. He was taken to [[New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center]] in [[Manhattan]], initially alert, but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg.<ref name="death-wapo"/> Damage to the brain caused swelling ([[cerebral edema]]) and Nixon slipped into a deep [[coma]]. On Friday, April 22, 1994, he died at 9:08 p.m., with his daughters at his bedside; he was 81.<ref name="death-wapo"/>

Nixon's funeral took place on April 27, 1994, the first for an American president since that of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in 1973, which was presided over by Nixon during his presidency. Speakers at the service, held at the Nixon Library, included then-President [[Bill Clinton]], former Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]], Senate Minority Leader [[Bob Dole]], California Governor [[Pete Wilson]], and the [[Reverend]] [[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-18|url=http://www.nixonlibraryfoundation.org/index.php?src=gendocs&link=RNfuneral|title=Funeral Services of President Nixon|publisher=Richard Nixon Library Foundation}}</ref> Also in attendance were former Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, George H.

He was survived by his two daughters, Tricia and Julie, and four grandchildren.<ref name="death-wapo"/> In keeping with his wishes, his funeral was not a [[state funeral]], though his body did lie in repose in the Nixon Library lobby prior to the funeral services.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3783085.stm|title=Reagan funeral: Schedule of events|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-07-18|date=June 11, 2004}}</ref>

==Public perception==
Nixon's career was frequently dogged by his personality, and the public perception of it. Editorial cartoonists such as [[Herblock]] and comedians often exaggerated Nixon's appearance and mannerisms, to the point where the line between the human and the caricature version of him became increasingly blurred. He was often portrayed with unshaven jowls, slumped shoulders, and a furrowed, sweaty brow.<ref name="observer"/>

[[Image:elvis-nixon.jpg|thumb|left|Nixon meets [[Elvis Presley]] in December 1970.]]
Nixon had a complex personality, both very secretive and awkward yet strikingly reflective about himself.<ref name="ed150">Drew, Elizabeth (2007), p. 150</ref> He was inclined to distance himself from people and was formal in all aspects, always wearing a coat and tie even when home alone.<ref name="ed150"/> He advised people not to care about what others thought of them. Some experts have described him as having a [[narcissism|narcissistic]] and [[paranoia|paranoid]] personality.<ref name=RALPH_Ingalls_Fall2006>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ralphmag.org/nixon.html|accessdate=2006-04-04|title=Book Review:'' Nixon: A Psychobiography'' by Vamik D. Volkan, Norman Itzkowitz, and Andrew W. Dod|first=Michael A. |last=Ingall|journal=The Review of Arts, Literature, Philosophy and the Humanities|volume=XII |issue=3|date=Fall 1996}}</ref> Conrad Black described him as being "driven" though also "uneasy with himself in some ways."<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 574</ref> According to Black, Nixon "thought that he was doomed to be traduced, double-crossed, unjustly harassed, misunderstood, underappreciated, and subjected the to the trials of Job, but that by the application of his mighty will, tenacity, and diligence he would ultimately prevail."<ref>Black, Conrad (2007), p. 700</ref> Elizabeth Drew summarized Nixon as a "smart, talented man, but most peculiar and haunted of presidents."<ref>Drew, Elizabeth (2007), p. 151</ref>

He frequently brandished the two-finger [[V sign]] (alternately viewed as the "Victory sign" or "peace sign") using both hands, an act that became one of his best-known trademarks.<ref name="observer">{{cite news|title=Far Too Strange for Fiction: Nixon, Tormented Tragic Hero|url=http://www.observer.com/node/45098|work=The New York Observer|accessdate=2009-01-20|date=October 14, 2001|author=Lowy, Johnathan}}</ref> Due to his uptight image, many were surprised at the president's amount of swearing and anti-Semitic comments seen on the transcripts of the president's White House tapes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,29388,00.html?iid=digg_share|title=The Ford File and Its Surprises|accessdate-2009-01-20|date=August 12, 1999|author=Sidey, Hugh|work=Time}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[Image:Gravestones of President Richard and first lady Pat Nixon.jpg|thumb|The graves of President Richard and first lady Pat Nixon.]]

No American has served as long as Richard Nixon did in a national office.<ref name="cb1053">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 1053</ref> He is the only person in American history to appear on the Republican Party's presidential ticket five times, to secure the Republican nomination for president three times, and to have been elected twice to both the vice presidency and the presidency. With Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon was the chief builder of the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|modern Republican party]]. Throughout his career, he was instrumental in moving the party away from the control of isolationists and as a Congressman was a persuasive advocate of containing Soviet Communism.<ref name="cb1053"/>

Though he did not achieve all that he had wished for in the Middle East, Nixon virtually expelled the Soviet Union from the region and began an excruciatingly long peace process.<ref name="cb1054"/> He began formal relations with China and improved relations with the Soviet Union. Domestically, he decentralized government by revenue sharing, ended school segregation, reduced inflation (until it rose again as a result of the oil cartels), ended the gold standard, reduced the crime rate, and pioneered positive environmental measures.<ref name="cb1054"/> As a result of the Watergate scandal, however, the mood of the nation was severely affected and the office of the presidency was demeaned.<ref name="cb1054">Black, Conrad (2007), p. 1054"</ref>

James MacGregor Burns observed of Nixon, "How can one evaluate such an idiosyncratic President, so brilliant and so morally lacking?"<ref name=Skidmore2001_p495>{{cite journal|author=Skidmore, Max J.|title=Ranking and Evaluating Presidents: The Case of Theodore Roosevelt|journal=White House Studies |volume=1 |isssue=4 |year=2001 |pages=495+}}</ref> [[George McGovern]], Nixon's former opponent, commented in 1983, "President Nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers, China and the Soviet Union, than any other president since World War II.&nbsp;... I think, with the exception of his inexcusable continuation of the war in Vietnam, Nixon really will get high marks in history."<ref name=RollingStone_Greider1983_p13>{{cite journal|first=William |last=Greider|title=The McGovern factor|journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=November 10, 1983|page= p.13}}</ref>
