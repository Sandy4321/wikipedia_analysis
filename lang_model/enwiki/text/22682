'''PRR 4800''', nicknamed '''"Old Rivets"''', is a [[PRR GG1|GG1]]-class [[electric locomotive]] located at the [[Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania]], outside of [[Strasburg, Pennsylvania|Strasburg]], [[Pennsylvania]] in the [[United States]]. It is the prototype GG1 and was originally numbered '''4899'''. Built by [[General Electric]] in 1934, the locomotive competed against a prototype, the [[PRR R1|R1]], built by rival company [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]]. 4800 was kept in service by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and its successors, [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]] and [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]], until 1979. It was sold the next year to a local chapter of the [[National Railway Historical Society]]. 4800 was dedicated in 1982 at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania and was designated an [[Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark]] in 1983.

== Construction and testing ==
[[File:Gg4800.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of PRR 4800 showing the builder's plate]]
In 1933, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] decided to replace the [[PRR P5|P5]], and instructed [[General Electric]] and [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] to design an electric locomotive that was more powerful than the P5, capable of speeds of {{Convert|100|mph}}, have a lighter [[axle load]] and to be double-ended with a cab in the center of locomotive.<ref>Bezilla, p. 141.</ref> Westinghouse designed the [[PRR R1|R1]] #4800, and General Electric submitted the GG1, then numbered 4899.

The [[locomotive frame|frames]], running gear and riveted body for the prototype GG1 were built by [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]]. The partially built locomotive was then shipped to the General Electric factor in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] for the installation of its electrical components.<ref name="ASME 2">Absendchein, p. 2.</ref> Twelve [[traction motor]]s, two on each of the GG1's six powered axles, produced {{Convert|4620|hp|lk=on}} that was transmitted to the {{Convert|57|in|adj=on}} [[driving wheel]]s by a [[quill drive]].<ref name="ASME 5"/><ref name="ASME 2"/> Unlike other GG1s, access steps were installed at each end of the locomotive to ease maintenance of the pantographs; the pantographs were mechanically linked to a safety plate that blocked access to the steps when the pantographs were raised.<ref name="ASME 2"/> The finished locomotive was {{Convert|79|ft|6|in}} tall and {{Convert|16|ft}} tall, with both of its pantographs lowered.<ref name="ASME 5"/>

GG1 4899 was extensively tested against the R1 from August to November&nbsp;1934; both locomotives were substituted on regular passenger service between [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]].<ref>Bezilla, pp. 143, 145.</ref>  Both locomotives found to be capable of quick acceleration with short-term power outputs of up to {{Convert|10000|hp|lk=on}}.<ref name="Bezilla 145">Bezilla, p. 145.</ref> The GG1, however, did not exert as much lateral force into the rails as the R1, and that it was [[articulated locomotive|articulated]], which allowed for smaller a [[turning radius]] than the rigid R1. The Pennsylvania chose the GG1 over the R1 and immediately ordered another 57&nbsp;locomotives.<ref name="Bezilla 145"/> As the number scheme used by the Pennsylvania prevented the first locomotive in the class from being 4899, the R1 and GG1 prototypes, essentially, swapped numbers.<ref>Bezilla, p. 144.</ref> The Pennsylvania also enlisted the assistance of [[Raymond Loewy]] to refine the aesthetics of the GG1s. Loewy recommended that all subsequent models of the class should have a welded body rather than the riveted body on the prototype. This lead to the nickname "Old Rivets" being given to 4800.<ref name="ASME 2"/>

== Operation and preservation ==
On January&nbsp;28, 1935, 4800 inaugurated electric passenger service between [[Washington, D.C.]], to Philadelphia by pulling a charter train for railroad and government officials; 4800 set a speed record of {{Convert|102|mph}} outside of [[Landover, Maryland]] on the return trip.<ref name="ASME 2"/><ref>Bezilla, p. 153.</ref> Regular passenger service began on February&nbsp;10, 1935.<ref>Bezilla, p. 154.</ref> 4800 remained in regular passenger service with the Pennsylvania, and its successors [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]] and [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]]. In 1976, Conrail gave 4800 a red, white and blue paint scheme to commemorate the [[United States Bicentennial]].<ref>Absendchein, p. 5.</ref> 4800 was eventually retired by Conrail in October&nbsp;1979 after the locomotove's main [[transformer]] failed, which was deemed too expensive to repair.<ref name="ASME 2"/>

4800 was sold by Conrail in 1980 to the Lancaster-chapter of the [[National Railway Historical Society]] as [[scrap]] for $30,000.<ref name="ASME 2"/> The locomotive was given a cosmetic restoration back to its 1935 appearance by the nearby [[Strasburg Rail Road]] and volunteers. 4800 was dedicated and put on display at the [[Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania]] on November&nbsp;20, 1982.<ref name="ASME 2"/> It was designated an [[Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark]] by the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) on April&nbsp;23, 1983.<ref>{{Cite web |title=#83 Penn.
