'''''Sealab 2021''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[animated television series]]. It was shown on [[Cartoon Network]]'s adult-oriented programming block, [[Adult Swim]]. It premiered on December 21, 2000 and the final episode aired on April 25, 2005. ''Sealab 2021'' is one of the four original [[Williams Street]] series that premiered in 2000 before Adult Swim officially launched (the others are ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', ''[[The Brak Show]]'', and ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'').

Much like Adult Swim's ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', the animation used stock footage from a 1970s [[Hanna-Barbera]] [[cartoon]], in this case the short-lived, [[Natural environment|environmentally]] themed ''[[Sealab 2020]]'', along with original animation. While there was initial resistance from several of the original series' creators to the reuse of their characters, production moved forward on the series.<ref name="ref2">{{cite web | title = Midnight Munchies with [Adult Swim] | url = http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?imageIndex=4&oid=oid%3A5217 | date = 2005-03-09 | accessdate = 2009-12-29 | quote = Do the original creators of Birdman or Sealab ever come up to you and say, "What the hell did you do to my character?" Crofford: Actually, yes. Ouweleen: Yes, they're mad about it.}}</ref>  ''Sealab 2021'' was produced by [[70/30 Productions]].

==Summary==
[[Adam Reed]] and [[Matt Thompson (animator)|Matt Thompson]], the creators and writers of ''Sealab 2021'', came up with the idea for the show in 1995 while they were [[production assistant]]s for Cartoon Network. They stumbled on a tape of the show ''[[Sealab 2020]]'', and wrote dialog to match the lips. Cartoon Network passed on the show because they did not believe it was funny. Five years after quitting Cartoon Network, the two went back to the original tape, this time making the characters do what they wanted. Cartoon Network bought the show, coincidentally around the same time that Adult Swim was created.<ref name="morphizm">{{cite web | title = Predictability is a Disease: Adam Reed and Matt Thompson, Sealab 2021 | url = http://www.morphizm.com/features/adult_mattandy.html | date = 2003-03-13 | accessdate = 2007-03-24}}</ref> The original "pitch pilot" is available on the Season 1 DVD as a special feature.

The show is set one year after the time frame of ''Sealab 2020''. During this year, the crew's professionalism and morals have slowly degraded, causing the crew to spend more time goofing off in various ways rather than doing any serious work. None of the episodes share any connection or ongoing plot. As a result, continuity is frequently ignored; for instance, the entire installation is destroyed at the end of many episodes, and cast members are often killed in horrible ways.  While the show contains many references to the pop culture of the 1980s-2000s and appears to be set in the year 2021, [[John F. Kennedy]] is President and [[Robert Kennedy]] is his [[Attorney General]], suggesting that it is in fact still the early 1960s. (Episode 29, "[[List of Sealab 2021 episodes#Red Dawn|Red Dawn]]"). The show also contains numerous subtle references to The South, e.g. the submarine [[H. L. Hunley (submarine)|"The Hunley"]], and the discussion of [[Dollywood]].

Many fans and critics felt that the show fell into a sharp decline following the death of [[Harry Goz]], the voice of Captain Murphy.<ref>{{cite web | title = SCI FI Weekly: Review of Sealab 2021 Season-Three DVD | url = http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1956.html | date = 2005-11-21 | accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref> After four seasons, the final episode aired on April 25, 2005.

==Characters==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Captain Hazel "Hank" Murphy''' (voiced by [[Harry Goz]]) is the ostensible leader of the crew. He is deranged, and quite unfit for service; instead of providing any real leadership, he is usually neglecting his duties or putting Sealab at grave risk. The only episode which features Murphy acting responsibly throughout is "[[List of Sealab 2021 episodes#7211|7211]]", which is a faithful reenactment of the original ''[[Sealab 2020]]'' show. His voice actor, Harry Goz, died on September 6, 2003 from [[Multiple Myeloma]]. The show wrote his character off, saying that he left Sealab to fight in [[Dune universe|the "Great Spice Wars"]]. Goz was replaced by his son, Michael Goz, who voiced the character Bellerophon Shanks.

'''Rank:''' Captain
|-
| '''Captain Bellerophon "Tornado" Shanks''' (voiced by Michael Goz) earned his position as Sealab's new captain by answering a help-wanted ad. A retired [[American football|football]] [[coach (sport)|coach]] and [[redneck]], his personality bears a resemblance to Captain Murphy. Late in the series, Shanks drops his southern accent. The character was introduced as a replacement for Captain Murphy, played by Michael Goz's father, [[Harry Goz]], who had died.

'''Rank:''' Captain
|-
| '''Jodene Sparks''' (voiced by [[Bill Lobley]]) is the station's radio operator. He has never been seen standing and rarely leaves his office chair; it is widely understood by the crew that despite appearances he is not disabled, only lazy. He is often a co-conspirator with Captain Murphy in many of his escapades, though he sometimes attempts to act as a voice of reason for him. He's Claustrophobic, as well as always looking to get money from his fellow mates. He can be either a worthless slacker or an evil genius, depending on the episode's plot.

'''Rank:''' Commander
|-
| '''Debbie DuPree''' (voiced by [[Kate Miller]]) is a marine biologist, and one of only two adult females on the base. She has blonde hair and is often of interest to the males on Sealab. She has an ongoing sexual relationship with Doctor Quinn.

'''Rank:''' Lieutenant Commander
|-
| '''Derek "Stormy" Waters''' (voiced by [[Ellis Henican]]) is a pretty boy who is lacking in intelligence.

'''Rank:''' Lieutenant Commander
|-
| '''Dr. Quentin Q. Quinn''' (voiced by [[Brett Butler (voice actor)|Brett Butler]]) is an incredibly intelligent member of the Sealab crew. A Black scientist, he has an IQ of 260 and Ph.D.'s in several scientific disciplines. He is often the one that ends up running the station and is usually the voice of reason to Captain Murphy, playing the role of [[Double act|straight man]] to the majority of the crew. He also has a robotic body of his own design.

'''Rank:''' Lieutenant Commander
|-
| '''Marco Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar Gabriel Garcia Marquez''' (voiced by [[Erik Estrada]]) is the station's engineer. He is very powerful and a ladies' man, and often exclaims random things in Spanish, although not actually speaking the language. His name comes from both the Spaniard epic 11th century poem "[[El Cantar del Mio Cid]]", which featured the character Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, and from the 1982 Literary Nobel Prize winner journalist and novelist [[Gabriel Garc<U+00ED>a M<U+00E1>rquez]].

'''Rank:''' Lieutenant Commander
|-
| '''Hesh Hepplewhite''' (voiced by [[mc chris]]) is the station's reactor operator and is quite often the whipping boy as well. It was revealed that he is [[Jew]]ish. Nasal-voiced, smart-mouthed, and whiny, Hesh is not well-liked by most of the crew and thus works in the part of the station farthest away from them. Hesh has a habit of continually referring to himself in the third person.

'''Rank:''' Lieutenant
|-
| '''Debbie Love (a.k.a. "Black" Debbie)''' (voiced by Angela Gibbs) is both the only other adult female and the only black female on the station. She teaches school to the Sealab's orphans, is very proud of her race. In one episode, her name is displayed on a monitor as Debbie Allison; but in another her nameplate is shown as Debbie Love.

'''Rank:''' Lieutenant
|-
| '''Dr. Ilad Virjay''' (voiced by [[Adam Reed]]) is the station's official doctor and in-house surgeon, noted for his thick Indian accent and relatively normal personality. He graduated third in his class from The Medical College of Mescutabuti. He practices Manduism, the Sealab universe's version of [[Hinduism]].  It is later revealed that he is also janitor for sealab's restaurant section.

'''Rank:''' Unknown
|-
| '''Dolphin Boy''' is a little, chubby boy that talks in [[dolphin]] noises. He is a member of Black Debbie's class, is the target of endless fat jokes, and is often killed for no reason whatsoever by the Sealab crewmembers. He is the [[persona non grata]] of Sealab.

'''Rank:''' Lieutenant Jr. Grade
|-
| '''Sharko''' (voiced by [[Matt Thompson]]) is a half-human, half-shark freak of [[nature]]. He was born when [[Marco]], his [[human]] father, had sexual relations with a female [[shark]]. Ask him about it; he'll tell you the whole story.

'''Rank:''' None
