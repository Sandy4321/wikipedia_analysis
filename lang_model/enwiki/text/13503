The Keystone Library Network (KLN), founded in 1998, is a [[consortium]] of 19 [[libraries]], including the 14 [[Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education]]'s university libraries. The KLN provides its libraries with [[abstracts]] and access to 6,739 full-text [[journals]] and 10,000 business reports including country reports, industry reports, market research reports, and [[SWOT]] analyses. The KLN maintains library catalogs of its members' holdings through Pennsylvania Inter-Library Online Technology (PILOT). The KLN enables users at each library to simultaneously search a group of shared resources provided by the KLN in addition to searching the individual library<U+2019>s locally subscribed resources.
