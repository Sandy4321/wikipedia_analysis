'''Bia<U+0142>ystok-Krywlany Airport''' {{Airport codes|QYY|EPBK}} is an [[airport]] that serves [[Bia<U+0142>ystok]], [[Poland]].

==History==
The first plane piloted over Bialystok in 1910, Earl Michael Scipio del Campo, in the course of World War I hung over the city the German [[Zeppelins]]. 
By the summer of 1915 the [[List of Zeppelins#Z12|Z 12]] had dropped around 9 tons of bombs on the trunk railway line between [[Warsaw]] and [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] and the stations at [[Malkina]] and [[Bialystok]]; one flight carried a load of 3 tons.<ref name=Leh4>[[#Lehmann|Lehmann]] Chapter IV</ref>

Even then, there was a primitive airstrip. 


The selection of the area of the airport has been a real 19 February 1930 on the premises of the Provincial Committee L0PP on Warsaw Street. A representative of the Department of Aerospace Engineer Hennenberg presented four alternatives for the location of the airport, calling it a professional "field of ups", indicating the area is situated between the property Dojlidy and forest west of the farm Krywlany. After three years of negotiations finally the selection was made. After all the formalities dopi<U+0119>ciu in 1935 built the first hangar facilities and buildings. 

How to give Miroslaw Mikiciuk and Jan Tadeusz Pu<U+015B>ko (Opposite the storms and clouds), served as a backup landing base for the fifth Aviation Regiment in Lida. Shortly before the outbreak of World War II installed lighting for night flights and started to build a concrete runway. During World War II benefited from the use of the airport by German Air Force. 

Shortly after the war created in the Bialystok Branch of the [[LOT Polish Airlines]]. On 30 April 1945 started flying airliners every week on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays using [[Douglas DC-3]] aircraft. The flight from Bialystok to Warsaw lasted 50 minutes and tickets cost $ 400. This service - as a relic of capitalism - was quickly discontinued. Since that time, the airport has not seen any regularly scheduled service, just gliders. During the  mid-80s the border guards have stationed helicopters and light aircraft in addition to a helicopter ambulance.
