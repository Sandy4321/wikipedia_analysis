Scar who had sold it unstocked.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51982907|title=Commercial|newspaper=[[The Morning Bulletin]] |location=Rockhampton, Queensland|date=8 August 1879 |accessdate=14 March 2013|page=2|publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Costello began to stock the station later the same year when he had 700 head of mixed cattle [[overlanding|overlanded]] from Carrawal where he had previously worked.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article20327996|title=Port Curtis|newspaper=[[The Queenslander]]|location=Brisbane, Queensland|date=16 August 1879|accessdate=14 March 2013|page=217|publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Fattened cattle were taken overland to [[Adelaide]] for market in the 1880s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article56540390|title=Stock passing|newspaper=[[South Australian Register]]|location=Adelaide|date=19 October 1898|accessdate=15 March 2013|page=5|publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

The area was subjected to severe flooding in 1901 when Lake Nash experienced over {{convert|10|in|mm|0}} of rain in a single day, with the Georgina River running at almost record high levels.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article19102686|title=Floods in the far west|newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]]|location=Queensland|date=17 April 1901|accessdate=15 March 2013|page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Costello sold the property in 1905.<ref name="sunset">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article85538038|title=Out Towards the Sun Set. |newspaper=[[The North Queensland Register]]|location=Townsville, Queensland|date=16 January 1905|accessdate=15 March 2013|page=23 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

The area was inundated with {{convert|12|in|mm|0}} of rain in 1909, enough to get all the rivers running and reopen closed stock routes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article88296627|title=Cattle routes opened|newspaper=[[The Chronicle (Adelaide)|The Chronicle]] |location=Adelaide|date=3 April 1909|accessdate=15 March 2013|page=10|publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

In 1915 the station was acquired by the Queensland National Pastoral Company which had been formed to take over the [[pastoralism|pastoral]] properties owned by the Queensland National Bank. The company had raised capital of <U+00A3>850,000 and had invested in properties totaling {{convert|9362|sqmi|km2|0}}in area of which Lake Nash comprised {{convert|2808|sqmi|km2|0}}.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22296141|title=New pastoral company|newspaper=[[The Queenslander]]|location=Brisbane, Queensland|date=17 April 1915|accessdate=15 March 2013|page=35|publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

Two [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] men known as ''Dynamite'' Joe and ''Paddy'' Fraser were arguing over a woman when ''Dynamite'' attacked ''Paddy'' with an [[axe]] causing severe abdominal injuries. ''Paddy'' died en route to [[Cloncurry, Queensland|Cloncurry]] from internal injuries. ''Dynamite'' made his escape but was later caught and sent back to Lake Nash for trial.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article62765077|title=Dynamite Joe's dash |newspaper=[[Townsville Daily Bulletin]]|location=Queensland|date=20 May 1936 |accessdate=15 March 2013 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

In 1917 some 800 head of cattle were stolen from the station with two men, Thomas Hanlan and James Wickham, being arrested after they were found in possession of 200 of the stolen cattle near Frew River. Both men were found to be guilty and sentenced to five years hard labour and fined <U+00A3>100.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article69412622|title=Theft of Cattle|newspaper=[[The Capricornian]]|location=Rockhampton, Queensland|date=21 April 1917|accessdate=15 March 2013|page=23|publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

By 1923 the size of the property was estimated at {{convert|3400|sqmi|km2|0}} and was one of the larger runs in the [[Northern Territory]], although it was dwarfed by the largest of the day; [[Victoria River Downs Station|Victoria River Downs]], which occupied {{convert|13100|sqmi|km2|0}}.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48011874|title=Making it good for a few.

In 1950, Lake Nash came under scrutiny for using slave labour on the property as pumpers. The station was permitted to use much cheaper [[Indigenous Australian|native]] labour only white labour was not available, but this rule had been found to have been seriously breached by the station owners.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49475025|title=Slave Labour Used On Lake Nash.|newspaper=[[The Northern Standard]]|location=Darwin, Northern Territory|date=29 September 1950|accessdate=15 March 2013 |page=1|publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

The surrounding areas received over {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} of rain in March 1953 resulting in the Georgina River rising over {{convert|23|ft|m|0}}, the highest level in over 36 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article42786489|title=Flooding in the North-West areas|newspaper=[[The Cairns Post]]|location=Queensland|date=19 January 1953|accessdate=15 March 2013|page=3|publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The following year the property was hit by [[drought]] with only {{convert|2|in|mm|0}} of rain falling in the first eight months, this in turn meant that cattle could not be moved far from waterholes of bores as little water lay long the stock routes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50604977|title=Premier sees effect of rail lack|newspaper=[[Courier-Mail|The Courier-Mail]]|location=Brisbane, Queensland|date=15 July 1954|accessdate=16 March 2013|page=12|publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>
