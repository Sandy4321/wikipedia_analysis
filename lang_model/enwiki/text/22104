==''American Idol''==
===Overview=== 
Archuleta won his ticket to the [[Hollywood]] final auditions at the [[San Diego]] tryouts - held at [[Qualcomm Stadium]] at the end of July 2007 - with a performance of [[John Mayer]]'s "[[Waiting on the World to Change]]" with judge Randy Jackson spontaneously joining in to sing the background "waiting" in the song.<ref>{{cite news |title=Thousands audition in S.D. for 'American Idol' |first=John |last=Wilkens |date=2007-07-30 |work=Union-Tribune |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20070730-1859-bn30idol.html |accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref><ref name=AI/>) He was 16 during the Hollywood auditions (where his renditions of [[Bryan Adams|Bryan Adams']] "[[Heaven (song)|Heaven]]" and [[Gnarls Barkley]]'s "[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]" were well-received by the judges) and attended school while a part of ''American Idol's'' [[American Idol (season 7)|seventh season]].<ref name="idolchatter" /> His parents were there because he was a [[minor (law)|minor]].<ref name="idolchatter">{{cite web | title = Idol Chatter: A conference call with Nigel | url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/idolchatter/2008/02/a-conference-ca.html |first=Ken| last=Barnes | publisher=USA Today | accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref> Archuleta also took advantage of the decision to allow contestants to [[American Idol (season 7)#Changes from past seasons|play musical instruments]] when he accompanied himself on piano for his performances of "Crazy", "Another Day in Paradise", and "Angels."

A ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article speculated that Archuleta avoided singing the first verse of [[Imagine (song)|"Imagine"]]: because "of his religion ([[Mormonism]]), he's unlikely to espouse the song's [[agnostic]] ideal . . . with the line about 'no [[religion]] too.'"<ref>{{cite news |first=Ann |last=Powers |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=David Archuleta's 'Imagine' wasn't just imagined up |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2008/02/idol-banter-ima.html |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher= |date=February 28, 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-30}}</ref> Archuleta did, however, sing the entire song on ''Good Things Utah'' when he was 13. During his first performance of ''Imagine'' on ''American Idol,'' when asked by judge [[Randy Jackson]] why he didn't sing the first verse, Archuleta said the third verse was his favorite because it has "a great message."

In the finale he sang "[[Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me]]", "In This Moment" and "Imagine". Judge [[Simon Cowell]] declared that Archuleta won the evening and even [[David Cook (singer)|David Cook]], who ultimately won, thought Archuleta would win: "I have to concede it, the kid came out all three songs and nailed it", said Cook.<ref>{{cite web | title = Even David Cook Thinks David Archuleta Nailed 'American Idol' Finale: 'I Have To Concede It' | url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1587817/20080521/index.jhtml |first=Gil| last=Kaufman| publisher=VH1 |accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref> In the final tally, Archuleta received 44 percent of the votes.<ref>{{cite web
