'''''A Girl like Me''''' is the second [[album]] by [[contemporary R&B|R&B]]/[[Pop music|pop]] singer [[Rihanna]]. It was released through [[Def Jam Records]] on [[April 19]] [[2006]] in [[Japan]], on [[April 24]] in the [[United Kingdom]], and on [[April 25]] in the [[United States]] (see [[2006 in music]]). 

==Description==
''A Girl like Me'' is the follow up to Rihanna's 2005 album ''[[Music of the Sun]]''. Rihanna stated that while she did not wish to incorporate more [[rock music]] into her album, she did wish to create one song of mixed rock and reggae, "Kisses Don't Lie".<Ref>"MP3.com: Exclusive Interview with Rihanna", http://www.mp3.com/features/stories/4525.html, cited [[February 12]] [[2007]]</ref> R&B artist [[Ne-Yo]] contributed writing to the album, including the song "[[Unfaithful (song)|Unfaithful]]", which was the second single from the album. Rihanna said in an interview with [[Carson Daly]] that much of the music she sang on this album is music she would never have sung before.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The album features an original song called "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", not to be confused with the song by [[Queen (band)|Queen]].

==Chart performance==
The album debuted at number five on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with over 115,000 copies sold in its first week, nearly twice the debut sales of ''Music of the Sun''. It debuted at number five on the [[UK Album Chart]] with 24,000 copies sold that week. The album sold 200,000 copies worldwide in its first week and has been certified [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by the [[RIAA]].

The lead single, "[[SOS (Rihanna song)|SOS]]" (also known as "S.O.S. (Rescue Me)"), achieved considerable airplay throughout the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and reached high peak positions on both [[airplay (song)|airplay]] charts. It contains [[sampling (music)|samples]] of the 1981 cover version of "[[Tainted Love]]" from [[Soft Cell]]. The song peaked at number two in the UK and at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. "Unfaithful", the second single, reached number six on the Hot 100. The third single, "[[We Ride (Rihanna song)|We Ride]]", was released to U.S. radio on [[August 21]] and wasn't nearly as successful as the previous two singles, not charting on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 (it peaked at number six on the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]] chart); it was, however, a number-one [[nightclub|club]] hit. The fourth single from the album was "[[Break It Off]]" (featuring [[Sean Paul]]), which peaked at number nine on the Hot 100 to become Rihanna's fourth top ten single.
