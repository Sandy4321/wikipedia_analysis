'''''Soylent Green''''' is a 1973 American [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Richard Fleischer]] and starring [[Charlton Heston]], [[Leigh Taylor-Young]], and, in his final film, [[Edward G. Robinson]]. The film combines the [[police procedural]] and [[science fiction]] genres, depicting the investigation into the murder of a wealthy businessman in a [[dystopia]]n future suffering from [[pollution]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[resource depletion|depleted resources]], [[poverty]], dying oceans, and all year [[humidity]] due to the [[greenhouse effect]].  Much of the population survives on processed food rations, including "soylent green".

The film, which is closely based upon the 1966 [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Make Room! Make Room!]]'' by [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]], won the [[Nebula Award]] for Best Dramatic Presentation and the [[Saturn Award]] for Best Science Fiction Film in 1973.

==Plot==
The 20th century's [[industrialization]] has left the world permanently overcrowded, polluted and stagnant by the turn of the 21st century. In 2022, with 40 million people in [[New York City]] alone, housing is dilapidated and overcrowded; homeless people fill the streets; about half are unemployed, the few "lucky" ones with jobs are only barely scraping by themselves, and [[Food scarcity|food]] and working technology is scarce. Most of the population survives on [[rationing|rations]] produced by the Soylent Corporation, whose newest product is Soylent Green, a green wafer advertised to contain "high-energy [[plankton]]" from the world's [[ocean]]s, more nutritious and palatable than its predecessors "Red" and "Yellow," but in short supply.

[[New York City Police Department]] detective Frank Thorn ([[Charlton Heston]]) lives with his aged friend Solomon "Sol" Roth ([[Edward G. Robinson]]). Due to Roth's advanced age, he remembers life before its current miserable state, and he routinely waxes nostalgic for his youth when the air was clean and the weather wasn't perpetually summer. He was also well educated and has a small library of reference materials which he uses to help Det. Thorn solve crimes (consequently Roth is referred to as a police "book"). While investigating the murder of William R. Simonson ([[Joseph Cotten]]), obviously a member of the wealthy elite, Thorn questions Shirl ([[Leigh Taylor-Young]]), a [[concubinage|concubine]] (referred to as "furniture"), and Tab Fielding ([[Chuck Connors]]), Simonson's bodyguard, who, when the murder took place, was escorting Shirl to a store selling meat "under the counter" for Simonson.  Thorn searches Simonson's apartment for clues and enjoys Simonson's luxurious lifestyle like air conditioning and hot running water, and he helps himself to Simonson's real bourbon, fresh vegetables, and a flank steak that Shirl had purchased earlier as a special surprise for Simonson.  

Thorn later gives Roth the classified ''Soylent Oceanographic Survey Report, 2015 to 2019'' found in Simonson's apartment.  Roth's research reveals that Simonson and the current state governor of New York, Joseph Santini ([[Whit Bissell]]), were partners in a well-known high-powered law firm, and that Simonson was also a member of the Board of Soylent.

At the police station, Thorn tells his lieutenant, Hatcher ([[Brock Peters]]), that he suspects an [[assassination]]: nothing was stolen from the apartment, its sophisticated alarm was not working for the first time in two years, and Simonson's bodyguard was conveniently absent. Continuing his investigation, Thorn visits Fielding's apartment and questions Fielding's concubine, Martha ([[Paula Kelly (actress/dancer)|Paula Kelly]]), helping herself to a teaspoon of strawberry jam, later identified by Roth as too great a luxury for the concubine of a bodyguard to afford.

Under questioning, Shirl reveals that Simonson became troubled in the days before his death. Thorn questions a Catholic priest that Simonson had visited, but the priest at first fails to remember Simonson and is later unable to describe the confession. Fielding later murders the priest to silence him.

Meanwhile, Governor Santini orders the investigation closed, but Thorn disobeys and the Soylent Corporation dispatches Simonson's murderer to kill Thorn. He tracks Thorn to a ration distribution center where police officers are providing security. When the Soylent Green there is exhausted, the crowd riots.  The assassin tries to kill Thorn in the confusion, but is crushed by a [[Front-end_loader|"scoop"]] crowd-dispersion vehicle. Thorn then threatens both Fielding and Martha to scare Fielding out of following him and returns to Shirl, telling her that all cities are like theirs and the more valuable, unharmed countryside is guarded to protect the wealthier classes' privileges of better food, water and shelter, leaving the majority of people trapped in the cities with no escape.

Roth takes Soylent's [[oceanography|oceanographic]] reports to a like-minded group of researchers known as the Exchange, who agree that the oceans no longer produce the plankton from which Soylent Green is reputedly made, and infer that it must be made from human remains, as this is the only conceivable supply of [[protein]] that matches the known production.  Unable to live with this discovery, Roth seeks [[assisted suicide]] at a government clinic called "Home."

Thorn rushes to stop him, but arrives too late, and is mesmerized by the [[euthanasia]] process's visual and musical [[montage]] &ndash; a display of forests, wild animals, rivers, and ocean life, now extinct. Under the influence of a lethal drug, Roth tells Thorn his discovery and begs him to expose the truth. To this end, Thorn stows himself aboard a [[garbage]] truck to the disposal center, where he sees human corpses converted into Soylent Green. Returning to make his report, he is ambushed by Fielding and others.

He phones his precinct for backup but the precinct is engaged on a priority call. Thorn asks to be connected with Shirl, and to be "cut in" when the precinct is free. Thorn tells Shirl to stay with her apartment's new owner, and Shirl tells Thorn she wants to live with him, but the line is "cut in" and Thorn is connected to Hatcher. Thorn retreats into a cathedral filled with homeless people. In the ensuing fight, he kills Fielding but is seriously injured. When the police arrive, Thorn urges Hatcher to spread the word that "Soylent Green is people!".

==Production==
The screenplay was based on [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison's]] novel ''[[Make Room! Make Room!]]'' (1966), which is set in the year 1999 with the theme of overpopulation and overuse of resources leading to increasing poverty, food shortages, and social disorder.  Harrison was contractually forbidden control over the screenplay and kept from knowing during negotiations that it was MGM buying the film rights.<ref name="tcm"/>  He discussed the adaptation in ''Omni's Screen Flights/Screen Fantasies'' (1984),<ref name="tcm">{{cite web| title= Soylent Green (1973) | url= http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2061/Soylent-Green/articles.html | publisher= [[Turner Classic Movies]]| author= Jeff Stafford| accessdate= 2011-06-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Omni's Screen Flights/Screen Fantasies|date=1984|isbn= 0-385-19202-9|editor= [[Danny Peary]]}}</ref> noting, the "murder and chase sequences [and] the 'furniture' girls are not what the film is about &mdash; and are completely irrelevant", and answered his own question, "Am I pleased with the film? I would say fifty percent".<ref name="tcm"/>

While the book refers to "soylent steaks", it makes no reference to "Soylent Green", the processed food rations depicted in the film. The book's title was not used for the movie on grounds that it might have confused audiences into thinking it a big-screen version of ''[[Make Room for Daddy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author= Harry Harrison| url=http://www.iol.ie/~carrollm/hh/soycann.htm |title=A Cannibalised Novel Becomes ''Soylent Green'' |publisher=[[Ireland On-Line]] |work=Omni's Screen Flights/Screen Fantasies| year= 1984 |accessdate=2009-09-07}}</ref>

This was the 101st and last movie in which [[Edward G. Robinson]] appeared; he died of [[cancer]] twelve days after the filming, on January 26, 1973. Robinson had previously worked with Heston in ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956) and the make-up tests for ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968). In his book ''The Actor's Life: Journal 1956-1976'', Heston wrote "He knew while we were shooting, though we did not, that he was terminally ill. He never missed an hour of work, nor was late to a call. He never was less than the consummate professional he had been all his life. I'm still haunted, though, by the knowledge that the very last scene he played in the picture, which he knew was the last day's acting he would ever do, was his death scene. I know why I was so overwhelmingly moved playing it with him."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Actor's Life: Journal 1956-1976|page=395|author=[[Charlton Heston]]|editor=[[Hollis Alpert]]|publisher=E.P. Dutton|year=1978|isbn=0525050302}}</ref>

The film's opening sequence, depicting America becoming more crowded with a series of archive photographs set to music, was created by filmmaker [[Charles Braverman]]. The "going home" score in Roth's death scene was conducted by [[Gerald Fried]] and consists of the main themes from [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No.&nbsp;6]] ("Path<U+00E9>tique") by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Symphony No.&nbsp;6]] ("Pastoral") by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and the ''[[Peer Gynt Suite]]'' ("[[Morning Mood]]" and "<U+00C5>se's Death") by [[Edvard Grieg]].

==Critical response==
The film was released April 19, 1973.<ref name=nytreview /> ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' called it "intermittently interesting"; they note that "Heston forsak[es] his granite [[stoicism]] for once" and assert the film "will be most remembered for the last appearance of Edward G. Robinson.... In a rueful irony, his death scene, in which he is hygienically dispatched with the help of piped-in light [[classical music]] and movies of rich fields flashed before him on a towering screen, is the best in the film."<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,907127,00.html | title= Cinema: Quick Cuts| date= April 30, 1973| publisher= [[Time (magazine)|TIME]]| accessdate=2011-06-12}}</ref>  ''[[New York Times]]'' critic A.H. Weiler wrote "''Soylent Green'' projects essentially simple, muscular [[melodrama]] a good deal more effectively than it does the potential of man's seemingly witless destruction of the Earth's resources"; Weiler concludes "Richard Fleischer's direction stresses action, not nuances of meaning or characterization. Mr. Robinson is pitiably natural as the realistic, sensitive oldster facing the futility of living in dying surroundings. But Mr. Heston is simply a rough cop chasing standard bad guys.  Their 21st-century New York occasionally is frightening but it is rarely convincingly real."<ref name=nytreview>{{cite web| title= Soylent Green (1973) | url= http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D05EFDD1331EF34BC4851DFB2668388669EDE | date= April 20, 1973 | work= [[The New York Times]]| author=A.H.

==Cultural impact==
Because of the wide use of "'''Soylent Green'''" in popular culture, the section "Cultural impact" was created as a "catch-all" of the cultural references to the film and its famous final line; very few specific references should be added; otherwise it will become a long, unmanageable list. Please do NOT add specific references to television shows/films/books/video games/etc. which make minor mention of the movie or its famous "tagline", except for the most well-known, notable examples. References that do not include sources establishing their significance may be summarily removed.
