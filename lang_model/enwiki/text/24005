{{Reading}}

'''Learning to read''' is the process of acquiring the [[skill]]s necessary for [[reading (process)|reading]]; that is, the ability to acquire meaning from print.  Learning to read is paradoxical in some ways.  For an adult who is a fairly good reader, reading seems like a simple, effortless and automatic skill <ref name="Rayner, 2001">{{cite journal|last=Rayner|first=Keith|coauthors=Barbara Foorman, Charles A. Perfetti, David Pesetsky, and Mark S.

==Writing systems==
{{Main|Writing system}}

Writing systems are distinguished from other possible symbolic communication systems in that one must usually understand something of the associated spoken language to comprehend the text.<ref name ="Daniels">{{cite book|title=[[The World's Writing Systems]] |year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn= 0-19-507993-0|editor=Daniels, Peter T., and William Bright}}</ref>  Once established, writing systems on the whole change more slowly than their spoken counterparts, and often preserve features and expressions which are no longer current in the spoken language. The great benefit of writing systems is their ability to maintain a persistent record of information expressed in a language, which can be retrieved independently of the initial act of formulation.<ref name ="Daniels"/>

==Acquiring reading==
A child's ability to learn to read, known as [[reading readiness]], begins in infancy, as the child begins attending to the speech signals in their environment and begins producing spoken language.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83">{{cite book |author=Wolf, Maryanne; Stoodley, Catherine J.  |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=81<U+2013>83 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Children make some use of all the material that they are presented with, including every [[perception]], [[concept]] and [[word]] that they come in contact with; thus the environment in which a child develops affects the child's ability to learn to read.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/> The amount of time that a child spends together with [[parents]] or other important caregivers while listening to them read is a good predictor of the level of reading that the child will attain later in life.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Fields|first=Tiffany|title=Touch Therapy|year=2000|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=New York|isbn=0-443-05791-5|pages=255}}</ref>  As a child sits with a caregiver, looking at pictures and listening to stories, he or she will slowly learn that all the different lines on each page make different symbols and then that together these symbols refer to words.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/>  Taking time to read to children is the most important precursor to a child's [[Training and development|development]] of reading.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/> Preschool-aged children with limited exposure to books and reading in their home, including limited experience of being read to, are at risk of reading difficulties.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/> For example, these children tend to have less exposure to literary phrases, such as "Once upon a time",<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/> and have smaller vocabularies,<ref>{{cite web|last=Biemiller|first=Andrew|title=Canadian Language and Literacy Research Network|url=http://www.literacyencyclopedia.ca/pdfs/topic.php?topId=19|accessdate=20 November 2011|pages=10|format=pdf|year=2007}}</ref><ref name="MyersBotting2008">{{cite journal |last1=Myers|first1=L. |last2=Botting|first2=N. |title=Literacy in the mainstream inner-city school: Its relationship to spoken language|journal=Child Language Teaching and Therapy|volume=24 |issue=1|year=2008 |pages=95<U+2013>114|issn=0265-6590 |doi=10.1177/0265659007084570}}</ref> both factors that affect the ability to read by limiting comprehension of text. The environment in which a child lives may also impact their ability to acquire reading skills. Children who are regularly exposed to chronic environmental noise pollution, such as highway traffic noise, have been known to show decreased ability to discriminate between [[phonemes]] as well as lower reading scores on standardized tests.<ref name="CohenGlass1973">{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Sheldon|last2=Glass|first2=David C.|last3=Singer|first3=Jerome E.|title=Apartment noise, auditory discrimination, and reading ability in children|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=9 |issue=5|year=1973 |pages=407<U+2013>422 |issn=00221031 |doi=10.1016/S0022-1031(73)80005-8}}</ref>

Thus, the ideal process of what is called emergent or early literacy<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/>  begins in the relationship between hearing spoken language, seeing [[written language]] and feeling loved. The positive feeling that arises from spending time with books in a loving context provides a strong foundation and intrinsic [[motivation]] for the long and cognitively challenging process of learning to read.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/> However, reading to children and ensuring exposure to many [[books]] is not enough to prepare them for reading.<ref name="Wolf90">{{cite book |author=Wolf, Maryanne; Stoodley, Catherine J.  |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=90 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Another critical skill is the ability to name letters or characters.<ref name="Wolf90"/>

==Reading development==
{{tone|date=July 2012}}
There are five stages of reading development.  They are the emerging pre-reader, novice reader, decoding reader, fluent comprehending reader, and the expert reader. It is normal that children will move through these different stages at different rates.

===Emerging pre-reader===
The emerging pre-reader stage, also known as [[reading readiness]], happens when a young child sits and listens to someone read to them. Emerging reading takes many years of language experience, along with the increase of both conceptual and social development.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/>  Showing that this process starts early in a child's life is the fact that children typically produce their first few words before their first birthday.<ref name ="Rayner, 2001"/>  This emerging pre-reader stage usually lasts for the first five years of a child's life.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139">{{cite book |author=Wolf, Maryanne; Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=115<U+2013>139 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

One group of researchers in the United States found in the late 1990s and 2000s that the traditional way of reading to children made little difference in their later ability to read, and hypothesized this was because children spend relatively little time actually looking at the text.  They found that simple exercises during reading which directed children to pay attention to and think about letters and words made a significant difference in early reading progress.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/05/29/153927743/small-change-in-reading-to-preschoolers-can-help-disadvantaged-kids-catch-up|Small Change In Reading To Preschoolers Can Help Disadvantaged Kids Catch Up|agency=NPR|author=Alix Spegel|date=2012-05-29|accessdate=2012-07-17}}</ref>

===Novice reader===

The next step in the learning to read process is the novice reading stage<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/>  also known as selective association.<ref name ="Rayner, 2001"/>  This begins with the child learning to decode print and understanding the meaning of what has been decoded.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/> To do this, the child must first figure out the [[Alphabetic principle]] that actually took our ancestors thousands of years to discover, but now a child has to figure this process out in only a few short years.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/> Most children know that the words on a page in a [[book]] mean something, but do not readily understand how the letters code the meaning.  They know that these [[words]] are made of the sounds of their particular [[language]], and that letters convey these sounds.  Novice readers learn to hear and manipulate the smaller sounds into syllables and words.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/> If a child is able to master this skill, called [[phonological awareness]], it is one of the best predictors of a child's success in learning to read.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/> One way that you can teach children to become more aware of sounds within words is through such things as [[nursery rhymes]] that enhance the child's ability to hear and divide the structure of words.  Another way to teach a child to read is through little "games" in which the sounds in word are either clapped, written or danced to a beat.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/> A novice reader will also memorize the most common letter patterns in their own language and most of the frequent words that will not necessarily follow the phonological rules such as in English the words "have" and "who".<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/> It is in this stage that children will develop a vocabulary of words that is between 2,500 to 5,000 words.<ref name ="Rayner, 2001"/> The child's vocabulary continues to grow as they enter elementary school, since they will continue to learn new words at a rate of about seven words per day.<ref name ="Rayner, 2001"/> This shows that at this stage in reading the best piece of advice is to just practice, practice, practice or read, read more, and read again.

===Decoding reader===
The transition from the novice reader stage to the decoding stage is marked by the absence of painful [[pronunciation]]s and in its place the sounds of a smoother, more confident reader.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/> In this phase of learning to read, the reader adds at least 3,000 words to what they can decode. This means for example in the English language, that readers need to now learn the variations of the vowel-based [[rhyme]]s and [[vowel]] pairs  It is essential during this stage, if a reader is going to become fluent, that the reader acquire a sufficient repertoire of the letter-patterns and vowel-pairs that help to make up words that go beyond the basic level.The faster a child can see that the word "together" is "to-ge-ther", the faster the reader will become a more fluent reader.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/>
As children move forward with their reading skills, they learn a great deal about what is really inside a [[word]]; the stem, roots, [[prefixes]] and [[suffixes]] that make up [[morphemes]] of the [[language]].<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/>  By this stage, the children already know about the common bound morphemes such as "s" and "ed" because these are attached to many words.  Decoding readers become exposed to many types of morphemes such as prefixes and suffixes and it is when they learn to read these as "sight chunks" that their reading and their understanding will speed up dramatically. Being able to read at a fluent level is not only about how fast a child can read, but it is matter of being able to utilize all the special knowledge that they have about a word, its letters, letter patterns, meanings, grammatical functions, roots, and endings fast enough that they have time to think and comprehend what they are seeing.  The point of becoming a proficient reader is to fluently read and comprehend what had just been read. Decoding readers are young and are just beginning to understand and learn how to use their expanding knowledge of language and their growing powers of inference to figure out what they are really reading.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/>

It is also in the decoding phase that the child will learn to go beyond what is said in writing in the story to get the underlying meaning of what the story is really about. In the decoding stage a child also learns that if they do not understand a sentence or paragraph, that they may need to re-read it a second or third time to fully understand it.  Knowing when a text needs to be re-read is a very important skill and can improve comprehension greatly.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/>

===Fluent, comprehending reader===
The next stage in reading development is the fluent, comprehending reader stage, in which children shift from learning to read, to reading to learn.  In this stage the reader builds up a substantial background of knowledge of spelling.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/> It is during this time in a reader's development that teachers and parents can be tricked by fluent-sounding reading into thinking that a [[child]] understands everything that he or she is reading. As the content of what they are able to read  becomes more demanding, good readers will develop knowledge of [[figurative language]] and [[irony]] which helps them to discover new meanings in the text. This will assist them to understand the meaning of what they are reading beyond what is written on the page.  While learning to read, one of the most powerful moments is when fluent comprehending readers learn to enter into the lives of imagined heroes and heroines.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/> Examples of books where these imagined heroes and heroines could be found in include [[Harry Potter]], [[Lord of the Rings]], [[Huckleberry Finn]].  The comprehension process grows while reading books like these, where children learn how to connect prior knowledge, predict good or bad consequences, draw inferences from every danger-filled corner, monitor gaps in their understanding, and interpret how each new clue, revelation, or added piece of knowledge changes what they know. In learning these new skills, they learn to unpeel the layers of meaning in a [[word]], a [[phrase]] or a [[thought]].<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/>

There are two ways in which increasing fluency can be supported.  They include explicit instruction in comprehension by a child's teacher and the child's own desire to read. Engaging in conversation about what they are reading allows the beginning reader to ask critical [[questions]], facilitating a better understanding of the central meaning.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/> 

At the end of this stage, before the reader becomes an expert reader, many processes are starting to become automatic. This increasing automaticity frees up cognitive resources so that the reader can reflect on meaning.  With the decoding process almost automatic by this point, the brain learns to integrate more [[metaphorical]], inferential, [[analogical]], background and [[experiential knowledge]] with every newly won millisecond.  This stage in learning to read often will last until early adulthood.<ref name="Wolf143">{{cite book |author=Wolf, Maryanne; Stoodley, Catherine J.  |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=143 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Expert reader===
The final stage in learning to read, is the expert stage.  When a reader is at this stage of reading, it will usually only take them one half second to read almost any word.<ref name="Wolf145">{{cite book |author=Wolf, Maryanne; Stoodley, Catherine J.  |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=145 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  The degree to which expert reading will change over the course of an [[adults]] life depends on what a person reads and how much they read.<ref name="Wolf156">{{cite book |author=Wolf, Maryanne; Stoodley, Catherine J.  |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=156 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  As a person matures, their life experiences as well as the cognitive process of reading text shapes their reading comprehension.  It is this interpretive response that adds depth to reading and will often take them in a new direction from where the [[author]] intended.<ref name="Wolf156"/>

==Methods of teaching reading==
===Alphabetic languages===
Educators have argued for years about which method is best to teach reading to children. For the English language, there are two major methods, [[Phonics]] and [[Whole language|Whole Language]], within which there are subtypes [[Synthetic phonics|Synthetic Phonics]] and [[Sight word]] respectively. Each method is employed at differing rates depending on the country and the specific school division. Some educators are beginning to use the two methods in conjunction to maximize the benefits of both methods.<ref name="Rayner, 2001"/>
[[Phonics]] is a teaching method that stresses character-sound correspondences,<ref name='Neural Representations'>{{cite journal |author=Borowsky R, Esopenko C, Cummine J, Sarty GE |title=Neural representations of visual words and objects: a functional MRI study on the modularity of reading and object processing |journal= Brain Topogr |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=89<U+2013>96 |year=2007 |pmid=17929158 |doi=10.1007/s10548-007-0034-1}}</ref><ref name='Ventral and Dorsal Streams'>{{cite journal |author=Borowsky R, Cummine J, Owen WJ, Friesen CK, Shih F, Sarty GE |title=FMRI of ventral and dorsal processing streams in basic reading processes: insular sensitivity to phonology |journal=Brain Topogr |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=233<U+2013>9 |year=2006 |pmid=16845597 |doi=10.1007/s10548-006-0001-2}}</ref><ref name='Chinese Ventral and Dorsal Streams'>{{cite journal |author=Chan ST, Tang SW, Tang KW, Lee WK, Lo SS, Kwong KK |title=Hierarchical coding of characters in the ventral and dorsal visual streams of Chinese language processing |journal=Neuroimage |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=423<U+2013>35 |date = November 2009|pmid=19591947 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.06.078}}</ref> specific rules and their use in reading and spelling.<ref name="Rayner, 2001"/><ref name='Changes Reading Strategies'>{{cite journal |author=Sanabria D<U+00ED>az G, Torres Mdel R, Iglesias J, et al. |title=Changes in reading strategies in school-age children |journal=Span J Psychol |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=441<U+2013>53 |date = November 2009|pmid=19899646}}</ref>  This helps beginning readers understand how characters are linked to sounds ([[phonemes]]), patterns of letter-sound correspondences and spelling in English, and how to apply this knowledge when they read to sound out words. Phonics teachers present the spellings for different sounds in a specific order, introducing the simplest (or most useful) patterns early on; these patterns are then practiced.<ref name="Rayner, 2001"/> A disadvantage to phonics is that in some languages like English, there is a complex letter-sound correspondence and this causes confusion for beginning readers.<ref name="Rayner, 2002">{{cite journal|last=Rayner|first=Keith|coauthors=Barbara Foorman, Charles Perfetti, David Pesetsky, and Mark Seidenberg|title=How Should Reading be Taught?|journal=Scientific American|year=2002|month=March|pages=84<U+2013>91 |format=pdf |url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/pspi/reading.pdf}}</ref> 

Traditional phonics instruction has marked benefits. Early reading often involves significant expansion of a child's mental lexicon, which includes all the words the child has been exposed to and their meanings. By focusing on the principle of linking specific sounds and characters, the child has the ability to recognize new words and derive meaning from them. Being able to adapt what they know about language to new words they experience is crucial to expanding their mental lexicon; this allows for productive reading that is the ability to read new words.<ref name="Rayner, 2001"/><ref name="Rayner, 2002"/> It also produces higher achievement for beginning readers and the difference is the greatest for those at risk of failing to learn to read. While some children are able to infer these rules on their own, most need explicit instructions on phonics rules. Overall, children who are directly taught phonics are better at reading, spelling and comprehension.<ref name="Rayner, 2001"/><br /> 

Traditional phonics instruction can also have the unintended consequence of promoting dysfluency. The difficulty lies in the [[Coarticulation|coarticulated]] nature of speech; speech sounds are overlapping,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carello C, LeVasseur VM, Schmidt RC |title=Movement sequencing and phonological fluency in (putatively) nonimpaired readers |journal=Psychol Sci |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=375<U+2013>9 |date = July 2002|pmid=12137142 |doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2002.00467.x}}</ref> while print is discrete and sequential. This can be appreciated if one shapes the mouth in position to begin to produce the word ''cat'' compared to the word ''cot''. The initial hard ''c'' is colored by the subsequent vowel even before speech begins, i.e., the smiling position as one prepares to say ''cat'', and the more limp position as one prepares to say ''cot''. As early readers work from left to right, beginning with the onset consonant, they typically do not yet know the vowel with which it must be coarticulated. The vowel sound itself cannot be known until the remaining rime (the portion of the syllable beginning with the vowel and extending to its end: e.g. ''ight'' in ''right'') is fully encountered. For these reasons, teaching reading through orientation to rime first and then adding the onset (ought-bought) can be helpful in promoting fluency through supporting the phonological problems of coarticulation. Emphasis on the rime also supports the development of an intuitive, and therefore more fluent, awareness of orthographic patterns.<ref>Cherkes-Julkowski, M. (2005). find the "vawel", Read the Rime, Learn to Read. Apache Junction, AZ: Surviving Education Guides.</ref> 

[[Synthetic phonics|Synthetic Phonics]] is a method that is endorsed by the governments of the United Kingdom,<ref>{{cite web|title=Independent Review of the Primary Curriculum: Final Report|url=https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/Primary_curriculum_Report.pdf|publisher=DCSF Publications|accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref> Australia<ref>{{cite web|title=Teaching Reading: Report and Recommendations|url=http://www.dest.gov.au/nitl/documents/report_recommendations.pdf|publisher=Commonwealth Copyright|accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref> and Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Rhona|title=A Seven Year Study of the Effects of Synthetic Phonics Teaching on Reading and Spelling Attainment|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/02/20682/52383|accessdate=14 November 2011|coauthors=Joyce E Watson|date=11|month=February|year=2005}}</ref> It also has considerable support in the U.S.A.<ref name="NICHD, 2006">{{cite web |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm |title=Findings and Determinations of the National Reading Panel by Topic Areas |format= |work=NICHD Publications and Materials |accessdate=}}</ref>  and Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early Reading Strategy: The Report of the Expert Panel on Early Reading in Ontario|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/reports/reading/reading.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Education|accessdate=14 November 2011|year=2003}}</ref> In Synthetic Phonics, the student first learns to say the sounds ([[phonemes]]) that are associated with the character([[graphemes]]) in isolation before the sounds are "synthesized" or blended together to make a word. (e.g. /a/, /k/, /t/.) Then, when reading a word, he learns to say each sound in the word (e.g. /k/ - /a/ - /t/); and to "blend" these sounds into a pronunciation of the word (e.g. "cat").

Synthetic phonics does not teach whole words as shapes; and does not involve guessing at words from context, picture and initial letter clues.

There are other types of phonics, such as [[Analytical phonics]], that differ in their approach based on how a "chunk" within the word is defined (i.e. individual phonemes, syllables, or non-blended units). 

[[Whole language|Whole Language]] is widely used in the U.S.A. and Canada. It is a reading and learning method that trains students to focus on words, sentences and paragraphs as a whole rather than letters. This method aims to make reading fun and keep children motivated, which is beneficial because learning to read depends heavily on what the student does and not the teacher.<ref name="Rayner, 2001"/> While the child is typically very engaged in this method, many children struggle to infer the specific rules of the language on their own, which causes the child's comprehension and spelling to suffer in the end. 

One subtype is [[Sight word]], which is sometimes called the "look-say" method. A sight vocabulary of 50-100 words is first memorized <ref name="Rayner, 2002"/> and subsequent words are learned as wholes, often by seeing them used repeatedly in the context of a story.<ref name="Rayner, 2001"/> It tells children to find meaning by guessing, by recognizing whole words they have memorized, by looking at the pictures, and by creating a context based on surrounding words. It encourages students to "construct their own meaning" (with guidance from peers and facilitator of consensus process).<ref>{{cite web|last=Weatherly|first=Cynthia|title=GLOSSARY of Education Terms|url=http://www.crossroad.to/glossary/education.html#whole|work=Brave New Schools|accessdate=14 November 2011|coauthors=Sarah Leslie, Charlotte Iserbyt, Marla Quenzer, Betty Lewis, Elizabeth Stoner}}</ref>  It relies heavily on the child's experience with language as a whole. 
The following are some features of the whole language philosophy:<ref>{{cite web|title=What is the whole language philosophy?|url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/ReferenceMaterials/glossaryofliteracyterms/WhatIsTheWholeLanguagePhilosop.htm|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref> 
*Children are expected to learn to read and write as they learned to talk, that is gradually, without a great deal of direct instruction.
*Learning is emphasized more than teaching; it is assumed that the children will learn to read and write, and the teacher facilitates that growth.
*Children read and write every day in a variety of situations.
*Reading, writing, and spoken language are not considered separate components of the curriculum or merely ends in themselves; rather they permeate everything the children are doing.
*There is no division between first ''learning to read'' and later ''reading to learn''. (adapted from Weaver, C. 1990)
<br />
Which style use in teaching reading has divided educators for years. It is now known that using the two approaches together is more powerful than either program alone.<ref name="Rayner, 2001"/> The technical skills learned through phonics is important for many children when it comes to learning to read, spell, and general language comprehension but the engagement of children with language in the whole-language style is also important to keep the children motivated and excited to learn. While many teachers and schools acknowledge this and say that they use both methods to teach children to read in their schools, when asked explicitly it has been seen that many teachers still prefer to use only the whole language method and ignore the phonetic component.

=== Logographic languages ===

Languages such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] are normally written in [[logograms]] ([[hanzi]] and [[kanji]], respectively), which represent a whole word or [[morpheme]] with a single character.  There are a large number of characters, and the sound that each makes must be learned directly - it cannot be derived from its appearance.

[[Ruby character]]s are used in textbooks to help children learn the sounds that each logogram makes.  These are written in a smaller size, using an alphabetic or [[syllabic]] script.  For example, [[hiragana]] is typically used in Japanese, and the [[pinyin]] [[romanization]] into Latin alphabet characters is used in Chinese.

The examples above spell the word ''kanji'', which is made up of two kanji characters: <U+6F22> (''kan'', written in hiragana as <U+304B><U+3093>), and <U+5B57> (''ji'', written in hiragana as <U+3058>).

Textbooks are sometimes edited as a cohesive set across grades so that children will not encounter logograms they are not yet expected to have learned.

==Skills required for proficient reading==

*'''[[Speech perception|Speech Awareness]]''': The awareness of individual parts of speech as they apply to individual written characters is crucial for understanding reading (as defined by translating written characters into spoken language). [[Phonological awareness]], which includes the manipulation of [[rhymes]], [[syllable]]s, and [[syllable onset|onsets]] and [[syllable rime|rimes]], is most prevalent in Alphabetic systems.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ehri|first=Linnea|coauthors=Simone Nunes, Dale Willows, Barbara Valeska Schuster, Zohreh Yaghoub-Zadeh, Timothy Shanahan|title=Phonemic awareness instruction helps children learn to read: Evidence from the National Reading Panel's meta-analysis|journal=Reading Research Quarterly|year=2001|month=July/August/September|volume=36|issue=3|pages=250<U+2013>287 | url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/748111?uid=3738032&uid=2&uid=4&sid=56240766593}}</ref> The important part of speech depends on the [[Writing system]] employed.

* '''[[Fluency]]''': The ability to read orally with speed, accuracy, and [[vocal]] expression. The ability to read fluently is one of several critical factors necessary for reading comprehension. If a reader is not fluent, it may be difficult to remember what has been read and to relate the ideas expressed in the text to his or her background knowledge. This accuracy and automaticity of reading serves as a bridge between decoding and comprehension.<ref name="Rasinski, T"/>

* '''[[Vocabulary]]''': A critical aspect of reading comprehension is vocabulary development.<ref name="Justice 2002 87<U+2013>106"/> When a reader encounters an unfamiliar word in print and decodes it to derive its spoken pronunciation, the reader understands the word if it is in the reader's spoken vocabulary. Otherwise, the reader must derive the meaning of the word using another strategy, such as context. If the development of the child's vocabulary is impeded by things such as ear infections, that inhibit the child from hearing new words consistently, then the development of reading will also be impaired.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wolf, Maryanne; Stoodley, Catherine J.  |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=104<U+2013>105 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

*'''[[Reading comprehension]]''': The NRP describes comprehension as a complex [[cognitive]] process in which a reader intentionally and interactively engages with the text. Reading comprehension is heavily dependent on skilled word recognition and decoding,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kendeou P, Savage R, van den Broek P |title=Revisiting the simple view of reading |journal=Br J Educ Psychol |volume=79 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=353<U+2013>70 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19091164 |doi=10.1348/978185408X369020 |url=}}</ref> oral reading fluency, a well-developed vocabulary and active engagement with the text.<ref name="Fien 2010 631<U+2013>653"/>

*'''[[Rapid automatized naming]]''': The ability to say quickly the names of letters, objects and colors predicts an individual's ability to read. This might be linked to the importance of quick retrieval of [[phonological]] representations from [[long-term memory]] in reading and the importance of object-naming circuits in the left [[cerebral hemisphere]] that are recruited to underpin a child's word-recognition abilities.<ref name="Lerv<U+00E5>g"/><ref name="Denckla MB 1974"/>

*'''[[Orthography]]''' describes or defines the set of symbols used in a language, and the rules about how to write these symbols.  Orthographic Development proceeds in increasing complexity as a child learns to read. Some of the first things to be learnt are the orthographic conventions such as the direction of reading and that there are differing typefaces and capitalization for each symbol.<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/> In general, this means that to read proficiently, the reader has to understand elements of the written language including [[hyphen]]ation, [[capitalization]], [[word|word breaks]], [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], and [[punctuation]].<ref name="Coulmas, Florian 1996. p. 379"/>

* '''Practice''': repeated exposure to print improves many aspects of learning to read and most importantly the knowledge of individual words. It increases the speed at which high frequency words are recognized which allows for increased [[Fluency]] in reading. It also supports orthographic development,<ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/> [[Reading comprehension]] and [[Vocabulary]] development.<ref name="Rayner, 2001"/>

==Reading difficulties==
Difficulties in reading typically involve difficulty with one or more of the following: decoding, reading rate, reading fluency, or reading comprehension.

===Decoding===
{{Main|Dyslexia}}
Difficulty with decoding is marked by having not acquired the [[phoneme]]-[[grapheme]] mapping concept. One specific disability characterized by poor decoding is [[dyslexia]], defined as brain-based type of learning disability that specifically impairs a person's ability to read.<ref name="nih">{{cite web|title=NINDS Dyslexia Information Page|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm|publisher=[[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]]|accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref>   These individuals typically read at levels significantly lower than expected despite having normal intelligence. It can also be inherited in some families, and recent studies have identified a number of genes that may predispose an individual to developing dyslexia. Although the symptoms vary from person to person, common characteristics among people with dyslexia are difficulty with spelling, phonological processing (the manipulation of sounds), and/or rapid visual-verbal responding.<ref name="nih"/>  Adults, can have either developmental dyslexia<ref name='Heim'>{{Cite journal |author=Heim S, Tschierse J, Amunts K |title=Cognitive subtypes of dyslexia |journal=Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=73<U+2013>82 |year=2008 |pmid=18389017 |url=http://www.ane.pl/linkout.php?pii=6809 |issn=0065-1400}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Facoetti A |title=Auditory and visual automatic attention deficits in developmental dyslexia |journal=Brain Res Cogn Brain Res |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=185<U+2013>91 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12668226 |doi=10.1016/S0926-6410(02)00270-7 |url= |author-separator=, |author2=Lorusso ML |author3=Paganoni P |display-authors=3 |last4=Cattaneo |first4=Carmen |last5=Galli |first5=Raffaella |last6=Umilt<U+00E0> |first6=Carlo |last7=Mascetti |first7=Gian Gastone}}</ref><ref name=anchoring>{{Cite journal |author=Ahissar M |title=Dyslexia and the anchoring-deficit hypothesis |journal=Trends Cogn.

===Reading Rate===
Individuals with reading rate difficulties tend to have accurate word recognition and normal comprehension abilities, but the reading speed is below grade level.<ref>{{cite book |author=Catts, Hugh William; Kamhi, Alan G.; |title=The connections between language and reading disabilities |publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale, N.J |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-8058-5001-5 |oclc=470295626 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Strategies such as guided reading, silent reading and modeled reading may help improve a reader's reading rate<ref name="National Reading Panel, 2000, Subgroups"/>

===Reading Fluency===
Individuals with reading fluency difficulties fail to maintain a fluid, smooth pace when reading. Strategies used for overcoming reading rate difficulties are also useful in addressing reading fluency issues.<ref name="National Reading Panel, 2000, Subgroups"/>

===Reading Comprehension===
Individuals with reading comprehension difficulties are commonly described as poor comprehenders. They have normal decoding skills as well as a fluid rate of reading, but have difficulty comprehending text when read. Increasing vocabulary knowledge, listening skills and teaching basic comprehension techniques may help facilitate better [[reading comprehension]].
