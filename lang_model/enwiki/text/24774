'''Graphviz''' (short for ''Graph Visualization Software'') is a package of open source tools initiated by [[AT&T Labs|AT&T Research Labs]] for [[Graph drawing|drawing]] [[Graph theory|graphs]] specified in [[DOT language]] scripts. It also provides libraries for software applications to use the tools. Graphviz is [[free software]] licensed under the [[Common Public License]].

==Architecture==

Graphviz consists of a graph description language named the [[DOT language]]<ref>[http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html The DOT Language<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and a set of tools that can generate and/or process DOT files: 

; dot : a [[command-line]] tool to lay out directed graphs into a variety of output formats ([[PostScript]], [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], annotated text and so on).
; neato : for "spring model" layout (in Mac OS version called "energy minimised")
; twopi : for radial graph layouts. 
; circo : for circular graph layouts.
; fdp : another layout engine for undirected graphs.
; dotty : a [[graphical user interface]] to visualize and edit graphs.
; lefty : a programmable (in a language inspired by [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=318642 EZ]<ref>[http://graphviz.org/pdf/leftyguide.pdf The Lefty guide (<U+201C>Editing Pictures with lefty<U+201D>)], section&nbsp;3.1, p.&nbsp;9.</ref>) [[GUI widget|widget]] that displays DOT graphs and allows the user to perform actions on them with the mouse. Lefty can therefore be used as the view in a [[model-view-controller]] GUI application that uses graphs.
