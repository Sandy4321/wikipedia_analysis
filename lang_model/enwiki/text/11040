In [[differential geometry]], a '''G<sub>2</sub>-structure''' is an important type of [[G-structure]] that can be defined on a [[smooth manifold]].  If ''M'' is a smooth manifold of dimension seven, then a G<sub>2</sub>-structure is a reduction of structure group of the [[frame bundle]] of ''M'' to the [[compact group|compact]], exceptional [[Lie group]] [[G2_%28mathematics%29|<math>G_2</math>]].

== Equivalent conditions ==
The condition of ''M '' admitting a G<sub>2</sub> structure is equivalent to any of the following conditions:
*The first and second [[Stiefel<U+2013>Whitney class]]es of ''M'' vanish.
*''M'' is [[orientable]] and admits a [[spin structure]].
The last condition above correctly suggests that many manifolds admit G<sub>2</sub>-structures.

== History ==
Manifold with holonomy <math>G_2</math> was firstly introduced by Edmond Bonan in 1966, who constructed the parallel 3-form, the parallel 4-form and showed that this manifold was Ricci-flat. The first complete, but noncompact 7-manifolds with holonomy <math>G_2</math> were constructed by [[Robert Bryant (mathematician)|Robert Bryant]] and Salamon in 1989.  The first compact 7-manifolds with holonomy <math>G_2</math> were constructed by [[Dominic Joyce]] in 1994, and compact <math>G_2</math> manifolds are sometimes known as "Joyce manifolds", especially in the physics literature.


== Remarks ==
The property of being a [[G2_manifold|G<sub>2</sub>-manifold]] is much stronger than that of admitting a G<sub>2</sub>-structure.  Indeed, a G<sub>2</sub>-manifold is a manifold with a G<sub>2</sub>-structure which is [[G-structure#Torsion_of_a_G-structure|torsion-free]].

The letter "G" occurring in the phrases "G-structure" and "G<sub>2</sub>-structure" refers to different things.  In the first case, G-structures take their name from the fact that arbitrary Lie groups are typically denoted with the letter "G".  On the other hand, the letter "G" in "G<sub>2</sub>" comes from the fact that the its Lie algebra is the seventh type ("G" being the seventh letter of the alphabet) in the classification of complex simple Lie algebras by [[<U+00C9>lie Cartan]].
