'''HMAS ''Psyche''''' (formerly '''HMS ''Psyche''''') was a [[Pelorus class cruiser|''Pelorus'' class]] light cruiser built for the [[Royal Navy]] at the end of the 19th century. Initially operating on the [[North America and West Indies Station]], the cruiser was transferred to the [[Australian Squadron]] in 1903, and remained there until the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) took over responsibility in 1913. After a stint in New Zealand waters and involvement in the [[Occupation of German Samoa]], ''Psyche'' was paid off in 1915.

At the recommendation of the Australian government, the ship was commissioned into the RAN in 1915, and assigned to patrol the coast of Burma, in response to the threat of a German-instigated uprising. ''Psyche'' operated in the Bay of Bengal and around Sumatra until 1916, when she was docked at Hong Kong for refit. During this, personnel from the ship were used to commission and man the river gunboat {{HMS|Moorhen|1901|6}}. After the refit's conclusion, ''Psyche'' patrolled in Chinese waters, before returning to the Bay of Bengal. ''Psyche'' returned to Sydney and was paid off in October 1917, but recommissioned a month later for patrols in Australia's norther waters. She was decommissioned for the final time in early 1918. The ship was sold for use as a timber lighter in 1922, and was sunk in 1940 at [[Salamander Bay, New South Wales]].

==Design and construction==
''Psyche'' was a third-class [[protected cruiser]] of the nine-ship [[Pelorus class|''Pelorus'' or P class]].<ref name=Cassells116>Cassells, ''The Capital Ships'', p. 116</ref> She had a displacement of 2,135 tons, was {{convert|313|ft|6|in|m}} [[Length overall|long overall]] and {{convert|300|ft|m}} long [[between perpendiculars]], had a beam of {{convert|36|ft|6|in|m}}, and a draught of {{convert|15|ft|m}}.<ref name=Cassells116/> Propulsion was supplied by inverted three-cylinder [[Triple expansion engine|triple expansion steam engine]]s, built by Keyham, providing {{convert|7000|ihp}} to two propeller shafts.<ref name=Cassells117>Cassells, ''The Capital Ships'', p. 117</ref> ''Psyche'' was capable of reaching {{convert|20|kn|lk=in}}, although she normally operated at the more economical speedo of {{convert|8|kn}}.<ref name=Cassells116/>

The cruiser was armed with eight single QF {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns, eight single QF [[3 pounder gun]]s, two 4.7-inch guns, two [[field gun]]s, three [[Maxim gun|Maxim machine guns]], and two {{convert|14|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s sited above the waterline.<ref name=Cassells117/> The ship's company initially stood at 220, but this was later reduced to 188; 12 officers, and 176 sailors.<ref name=Cassells117/>

''Psyche'' was laid down for the Royal Navy at [[HMNB Devonport|HM Devonport Dockyard]], [[Plymouth]] on 15 November 1897.<ref name=Cassells117/> She was launched on 19 July 1988 by Miss E. Carr, sister of the dockyard's admiral superintendent.<ref name=Cassells117/> The cruiser was completed on 28 April 1899, and was placed in reserve until her commissioning on 2 May 1899.<ref name=Cassells117/>

==Operational history==
''Psyche'' originally operated on the [[North America and West Indies Station]].<ref name=Cassells117/> In December 1903, she was transferred to the Royal Navy's [[Australian Squadron]], where she served until October 1913, when the [[Australia Station]] was handed to the control of the fledgling RAN.<ref name=Cassells117/> ''Psyche'' was then assigned to New Zealand waters.<ref name=Djokovic175>Djokovic, ''HMAS Psyche - The Forgotten Cruiser'', p. 175</ref> In 1914, ''Psyche'' formed part of the escort for the New Zealand Force which [[Occupation of German Samoa|occupied German Samoa]] (now [[Samoa]]).<ref name=Bastock>Bastock, ''Ships on the Australia Station'', p. 121</ref> ''Psyche'' also escorted troop ships heading from New Zealand to the Middle East.<ref name=Djokovic175/> She returned to Sydney in late 1914, and was decommissioned on 22 January 1915.<ref name=Djokovic175/><ref name=Bastock/>

In May 1915, the Australian government suggested to the [[Admiralty]] that ''Psyche'' be reactivated and loaned to the RAN as a training ship.<ref name=Djokovic175/> Approval was granted on 1 June, but before the ship's 1 July commissioning as HMAS ''Psyche'', the Admiralty instead requested that the [[Australian Commonwealth Naval Board]] orchestrate a patrol of the [[Bay of Bengal]], in response to the threat of a German-inspired uprising in India and Burma.<ref name=Djokovic175/> ''Psyche'' was hastily fitted out, provided with a ship's company consisting primarily of untrained sailors, and sailed on 16 August with {{HMAS|Fantome}} for Singapore.<ref name=Djokovic175/><ref name=Cassells117/> From there, the ships sailed to Ragoon, arriving on 10 September with ''Psyche''{{'}}s captain, Commander Henry Feakes, under instructions to establish patrols along the Burmese coast with the two warships, plus three [[British India Steam Navigation Company]] vessels.<ref name=Djokovic175/> Command of the Burma Coast Patrol was passed to Captain George Hutter of {{HMS|Diana|1895|6}} on 20 September, with Feakes appointed as Senior Naval Officer Burma and overall commander of the three British India vessels and ten coastal launches.<ref name=Djokovic176>Djokovic, ''HMAS Psyche - The Forgotten Cruiser'', p. 176</ref> For ''Psyche'', 10-to-12-day patrols along the Burmese coast were the norm, interspersed with crew training duties.<ref name=Djokovic176/>

On 17 January 1916, the demobilisation of the Burma Coast Patrol was ordered, as the threat of insurrection in India and Burma had ceased, and German machinations had focused on the Malay Peninsula.<ref name=Djokovic176/> ''Psyche'' arrived at Penang on 28 January, then sailed three days later for [[Port Blair]].<ref name=Djokovic176/> From here, the ship performed patrols of [[Sumatra]].<ref name=Djokovic176/> On 12 February, seven stokers refused duty in protest over the poor quality of food being provided to the sailors aboard.<ref name=Djokovic177>Djokovic, ''HMAS Psyche - The Forgotten Cruiser'', p. 177</ref> All seven were found guilty of disobeying orders, and were punished with prison sentences between 12 and 14 months, plus dismissal from the RAN.<ref name=Djokovic177/> The remaining stokers were supplemented by native personnel until 25 April, when replacement RAN personnel arrived.<ref name=Djokovic177/> During March, the ship patrolled the Gulf of Siam, and escorted a Russian troop convoy sailing to Europe.<ref name=Djokovic178>Djokovic, ''HMAS Psyche - The Forgotten Cruiser'', p. 178</ref> During April, further patrols of the Bay of Bengal were made, before ''Psyche'' sailed to Hong Kong for inspection and refit.<ref name=Djokovic178/> During the period from late 1915 to early 1916, ''Psyche'' served as escort to two ships carrying Turkish prisoners of war, was responsible for the transportation of two Chinese spies (one of whom escaped), and helped capture the ringleaders of an Indian soldiers' mutiny in Singapore.<ref name=Cassells117/>{{when|Reason=Dates not specified in cited source|date=December 2010}}

During the refit period, personnel from ''Psyche'' were used to commission the river gunboat {{HMS|Moorhen|1901|6}} on 6 July, and then man her to evacuate European civilians from [[Canton (Guangzhou)|Canton]].<ref name=Cassells117/><ref name=Djokovic178/> The gunboat was halfway up the [[Pearl River Delta]] when it was learned that the civilians had been recovered by another vessel, and returned to Hong Kong, where ''Moorhen'' decommissioned on 23 July.<ref name=Cassells117/> Also during July, sickness ran through the ship, with 67 personnel sent to the naval hospital ashore, while another 41 were treated aboard: about 60% of the ship's company were unfit for duty during this period.<ref name=Cassells117/><ref name=Djokovic178/> Recurring ilnesses had been a problem while the ship operated in tropical climates, and the ship's surgeon recommended the ship be deployed to cooler regions.<ref name=Djokovic178/> For one day, the reassignment of [[flag officer]]s meant that ''Psyche'' was Flagship of the [[China Squadron]].<ref name=Cassells117/>

Released from dockyard hands on 14 August, ''Psyche'' began patrols along the Chinese coast, with a marked improvement of the health of all aboard.<ref name=Djokovic178/> These continued until 14 October, when the cruiser was assigned to Singapore for further patrols of the Bay of Bengal and Sumatra.<ref name=Djokovic178/> In March and April 1917, she was assigned to escort duties between Burma and India.<ref name=Djokovic178/> On 11 August, ''Psyche'' was relieved by {{HMS|Suffolk|1903|6}}, and sailed to Sydney, where she arrived on 28 September.<ref name=Djokovic178/>

The ship was paid off on 16 October 1917.<ref name=Cassells118>Cassells, ''The Capital Ships'', p. 118</ref> ''Psyche'' was reactivated on 20 November 1917 for service along Australia's north-east coast, but after uneventful patrols, she was decommissioned for the final time on 26 March 1918.<ref name=Cassells118/>

==Fate==
The ship was sold to the Moreland Metal Company on 21 July 1922, who used her as a timber lighter.<ref name=Cassells118/> ''Psyche'' sank in 1940 at [[Salamander Bay, New South Wales]].<ref name=Cassells118/><ref name=Wrecksitge>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?51613 |title=Psyche (+1940) |publisher=Wrecksite |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> The wreck was later broken up by [[Clearance Diving Team (RAN)|RAN clearance divers]] during an underwater demolitions training exercise.<ref name=Cassells118/>{{when|reason=Date not specified in cited source|date=December 2010}}
