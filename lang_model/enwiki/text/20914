'''Rachael Dunlop''' (born 19 November 1970), popularly known as '''Dr. Rachie''', is an Australian medical researcher and [[scientific skepticism|skeptic]]. She is a [[postdoctoral fellow]] in cell biology at the [[University of Technology, Sydney]]. In 2013 she and her colleagues discovered that an [[amino acid]] produced by [[cyanobacteria]] (blue-green algae) can trigger the onset of [[motor neurone disease]] (also known as ALS), and this research may help lead to a treatment for this fatal disease.<ref name="ABC" />

A prominent member of the Australian skeptic movement, she frequently [[blog]]s about and speaks out against the [[anti-vaccine movement]] in Australia and has a regular segment on ''[[Australian_Skeptics#The_Skeptic_Zone| The Skeptic Zone]]'' podcast.<ref name="zoneaboutus" /> Dunlop won a [[Shorty Award]] in 2010 for her [[Twitter]] posts about health-related topics.<ref name="shorty" />

Dunlop has been interviewed about skepticism, vaccines, and her research on several national radio and television programs, including ''[[Big Ideas (Australia)|Big Ideas]]'', ''[[The Project (TV program)|The Project]]'', and ''[[Lateline]]''.

==Education and Career==
In high school Dunlop studied both art and science, and after graduation got a certificate in fine art from [[Adelaide College of the Arts|Stanley Street School of Art]] (majoring in photography and print making), followed by an Advanced Diploma in Graphic Design from the [[Croydon Park]] campus of [[TAFE]] South Australia. She also completed AWARD (Australasian Writers and Art Directors) School.<ref name="ABClocal"/>

She has worked as a [[photographer]] and [[printmaker]], a [[graphic designer]], and a [[copywriter]] for a large international advertising agency.<ref name="MTS" />

Dunlop eventually lost interest in her advertising work and went on to earn a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[cell biology]] at [[Adelaide University]], even though she hadn't taken any biology in high school.<ref name="MTS" /> She then received an [[Honours_degree#Australia|honours degree]] from the Department of Experimental [[Pharmacology]] and [[Toxicology]] at Adelaide University and a [[PhD]] in cell biology from [[Sydney Medical School]] in 2005.<ref name="ISM"/> Her PhD dissertation examined the mechanisms of impaired degradation of [[oxidation|oxidized]] [[proteins]] with a focus on the consequences for [[heart disease]].<ref name="convobio"/>

She worked as a medical researcher at the [[Heart Research Institute]] in [[Camperdown, New South Wales]], and is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Technology, Sydney, where she studies [[Aging-associated_diseases|aging disorders]] and motor neurone disease.<ref name="ISM" /> She is also on the editorial board for the [[peer-reviewed journal]] ''Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies''.<ref name="convobio"/>

In 2013 Dunlop received media attention for publishing a study that demonstrated a link between exposure to cyanobacteria and motor neurone disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease. She and her colleagues found that the bacteria (commonly known as blue-green algae) produce an [[amino acid]] called [[BMAA]] that causes cell death and triggers the onset of the fatal disease.<ref name=BMAA /> The cyanobacteria responsible for the disease can be ingested by drinking contaminated water and may even occur on fruits and vegetables washed in this water.<ref name="telegraph" /> Additionally, BMAA may be responsible for the extremely high prevalence of the disease among the indigenous people of [[Guam]], who eat [[fruit bat]]s that have ingested the seeds of plants growing amongst the cyanobacteria. She suggests that the use of cyanobacteria in fertilizer production may even be linked to a higher incidence of motor neurone disease among certain athletes.<ref name="ABClocal" /> Other researchers have begun clinical trials of potential treatments based on this research. <ref name="ABC" />

==Skepticism==
[[File:244-Day 3-Panel-Truth About Alt Med-1 7-15-2012.JPG||thumb|300px|left|alt=One person standing at a podium and three people sitting at a table with microphones in front of them|[[Steven Novella]], [[Harriet Hall]], [[David Gorski]], and Rachael Dunlop (right) on a panel at [[The Amaz!ng Meeting]] 2012]]

Rachael Dunlop became involved in the scientific skepticism movement in 2008 after meeting [[Australian Skeptics]] president [[Richard Saunders (skeptic)|Richard Saunders]] at a [[Skeptics in the Pub]] event. She is currently the vice president of the [[New South Wales]] committee of the Australian Skeptics, and she has a regular segment called "Dr. Rachie Reports" on the organization's podcast, ''The Skeptic Zone'', where she dissects the claims of [[alternative medicine]] practitioners. She also co-organizes the Sydney Skeptics [[Meetup (website)|Meetup]] group<ref name="zoneaboutus" /> and helped organize [[The Amaz!ng Meeting]] Australia.<ref name="MTS" />

In 2008 Dunlop joined the [http://mysteryinvestigators.com/ The Mystery Investigators], headed by Australian Skeptics president [[Richard Saunders (skeptic)|Richard Saunders]].  The program teaches students to use science and critical thinking to investigate claims of the paranormal, such as [[water divining]], [[spoon bending]], and [[firewalking]].<ref name=MTS />

Much of Dunlop's advocacy as a skeptic is focused on countering the claims of the anti-vaccination movement, specifically the [[Australian Vaccination Network]] (AVN) and its former president Meryl Dorey. In 2010 the AVN was ordered by the Health Care Complaints Commission to post a prominent warning on their website, but the organization refused to comply and appealed the decision. In response, Dunlop and other skeptics organized a "[[Google bomb]]" so that Web searches for the name of the organization resulted in several links to critical websites on the first page of results.<ref name="bigideas" /> In 2009 the Australian Skeptics presented Dorey and the AVN with their [[Bent Spoon Award]], which is "presented to the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudoscientific piffle". Dorey quickly responded with a [[media release]] sarcastically "accepting" the award.<ref name="bentspoon" />

After the highly publicized 2009 death of four-week-old Dana McCaffery from whooping cough<U+2014>a vaccine-preventable disease<U+2014>AVN's Dorey claimed in a televised interview that the girl's death was unrelated to the disease. This inspired Dunlop and other skeptics to create a "Stop the AVN" [[Facebook]] group to advocate against the Australian anti-vaccination movement.<ref name="young" />

Dunlop has a blog, ''The Sceptics' Book of Pooh-Pooh'', where she writes about the Australian anti-vaccination movement and other science- and health-related topics.<ref name="pooh" /> She has also contributed articles to the ''Science-Based Medicine'' blog about the [[Australian Vaccination Network]], among other topics.<ref name="SBM" /> She occasionally writes articles on alternative medicine for ''[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]''.<ref name="convobio" /> She was invited to speak on two panels at [[The Amaz!ng Meeting]] 2012: "The Truth About Alternative Medicine" and "Dr. Google."<ref name="TAM2012" />

Dunlop argued in an [[editorial]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that media reporting of vaccine-related topics gives too much weight to voices from the anti-vaccine movement since they represent an insignificant minority compared to doctors and scientists who recommend vaccination.<ref name="guardian" />

She was nominated for a 2010 [[Shorty Award]] in the Health category for her [[Twitter]] posts on medical issues. Two other nominees in that category, Mike Adams (publisher of [[NaturalNews]]) and [[osteopathy|osteopath]] [[Joseph Mercola]], started campaigns to keep Dunlop from winning the award. [[Astronomer]] and skeptic [[Phil Plait]] accused the two men of using [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppet]] accounts to inflate vote counts.<ref name="Plait" /> Adams had his fraudulent votes revoked,<ref name="NatNews" /> and Dunlop went on to win the award.<ref name="shorty" />

==Media==
On 9 March 2010 Dunlop was interviewed by [[Richard Fidler]]on the [[ABC Local Radio]] program "Conversations." She discussed her work on cyanobacteria and motor neurone disease, her pro-vaccination advocacy, and her activities with Australian Skeptics.<ref name="ABClocal" />

On 28 April 2011 she was featured on the [[ABC Radio National]] program ''[[Big Ideas (Australia)|Big Ideas]]'' for a talk she gave at the Festival of Commercial Creativity. In the talk she discussed the dangers of using the Google search engine to self-diagnose medical conditions as well as her efforts to [[Google bomb]] the Australian Vaccination Network.<ref name="bigideas" />

The [[Network Ten]] television program ''[[The Project (TV program)|The Project]]'' featured an interview with Dunlop in a segment about conspiracy theories on 23 January 2012.<ref name="project" />

The [[Special Broadcasting Service]] and ''[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]'' website produced a video in May 2013 in which Dunlop dispels six "vaccination myths."<ref name="vaxmyths"/>

In November 2013 the Australian Vaccination Network was ordered by the New South Wales Administrative Decisions Tribunal to change their name so that consumers are aware of the anti-vaccination nature of the group. Dunlop was interviewed shortly afterwards on the Australian TV show ''[[Lateline]]'', where she praised the Tribunal's decision. According to ''Lateline'', former AVN president "Meryl Dorey claimed she was a victim of hate groups and vested interests" in response to the ruling.<ref name="lateline" />
