"'''Media Blitz'''" is the fifth episode of the [[Parks and Recreation (season 3)|third season]] of the American comedy television series ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', and the 35th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on [[NBC]] in the United States on February 17, 2011. In the episode, the parks department tries to draw media attention for the upcoming harvest festival, but the press becomes fixated on [[List of Parks and Recreation characters#Ben Wyatt|Ben]]'s past political mistakes. Meanwhile, [[Andy Dwyer]] takes on all of [[April Ludgate]]'s errands with the hopes of convincing her not to move to [[Indianapolis]].

Written by Harris Wittels and directed by [[David Rogers (editor)|David Rogers]], "Media Blitz" revolved largely around Ben's backstory as a child mayor who bankrupted his old town, which was originally a concept considered for series protagonist [[Leslie Knope]]. The episode was also what series co-creator [[Michael Schur]] called a "key moment" for April and Andy, ending a multi-episode subplot of April being angry with Andy for having been kissed by [[Ann Perkins|Ann]] in the [[Parks and Recreation (season 2)|second season]] finale "[[Freddy Spaghetti]]". "Media Blitz" featured guest appearances by comedians [[Matt Besser]] and [[Nick Kroll]] as [[morning zoo]]-style radio hosts "Crazy Ira and The Douche," as well as appearance by frequent ''Parks and Recreation'' guest stars [[Mo Collins]], [[Alison Becker]] and Jay Jackson.

According to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]], "Media Blitz" was seen by 4.33 million household viewers. It marked the lowest rating for the season to date, and constituted a more than eight percent drop from the previous episode, "[[Ron & Tammy: Part Two]]". "Media Blitz" received generally positive reviews, with several commentators particularly praising the performance of [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] as Ben. Some reviews, however, found less effective a subplot about the uncertainty surrounding the romantic relationship of Ann and [[List of Parks and Recreation characters#Chris Treager|Chris Traeger]], a state auditor played by [[Rob Lowe]] who is supposed to leave Pawnee for Indianapolis soon.

==Plot==
[[Leslie Knope|Leslie]] ([[Amy Poehler]]), [[Tom Haverford|Tom]] ([[Aziz Ansari]]) and [[List of Parks and Recreation characters#Ben Wyatt|Ben]] ([[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]]) start promoting the upcoming Harvest Festival on several Pawnee media outlets, starting with the local [[morning zoo]] radio show "Crazy Ira and The Douche" ([[Matt Besser]] and [[Nick Kroll]]).  The duo begin asking Ben questions about his time as a teen mayor in Partridge, Minnesota, having researched how he bankrupted the town. Ben responds awkwardly, stammering incomprehensibly and unable to defend himself to Crazy Ira and The Douche's taunts. Tom proposes dumping Ben from future media interviews, but Leslie insists they cannot because he is the only one who can handle complicated questions about its budget. Meanwhile, [[April Ludgate|April]] ([[Aubrey Plaza]]) accepts an offer from [[List of Parks and Recreation characters#Chris Traeger|Chris]] ([[Rob Lowe]]) to move to [[Indianapolis]] to be his secretary. [[Andy Dwyer|Andy]] ([[Chris Pratt]]) begs April to reconsider, offering to perform all the errands that she hates doing for a month. [[Ron Swanson|Ron]] ([[Nick Offerman]]) volunteers to help, claiming that he does not want to lose April as an assistant while denying he cares about April and Andy's relationship. [[Ann Perkins|Ann]] ([[Rashida Jones]]) is increasingly frustrated that Chris has not asked her about coming to Indianapolis with him, and is concerned about where their relationship is headed.

Unfortunately, Ben's past comes up again during Leslie's interview with newspaper reporter [[List_of_Parks_and_Recreation_characters#Shauna_Malwae-Tweep|Shauna Malwae-Tweep]] ([[Alison Becker]]), who asks why Pawnee should accept financial guidance from someone with a poor budget managing record like Ben. Tom and Ben go on the television show "Ya' Heard? with Perd" with Perd Hapley (Jay Jackson) in the hopes of recovering from the earlier debacle, but this interview is even worse, with Ben launching into a furious, incoherent rant when his past is brought up.  As a result, several businesses consider pulling their sponsorships from the Harvest Festival. Leslie decides to use her upcoming interview on "Pawnee Today" with [[List_of_Parks_and_Recreation_characters#Joan_Callamezzo|Joan Callamezzo]] ([[Mo Collins]]) to perform damage control. During the interview, Joan asks very biased questions about the festival and Ben's past. Annoyed, Leslie brings Ben on stage to give him a final opportunity to explain himself. Ben again begins to freeze up at the questions from people calling in, but he finally gets over it and vigorously defends himself. By the end, the questions switch back from Ben to the festival itself, making media blitz a successful one after all.

Chris tells Ann that after Indianapolis, he will be sent to a different city. The two agree they need to talk about the future of their relationship. Meanwhile, Andy's difficult day of running errands for April culminates with him getting arrested after April's sister Natalie (Minni Jo Mazzola) claims he is kidnapping her when he is merely picking her up from school. Ron approaches April and tells her that she should either forgive Andy or cut him loose, believing that she is only stringing Andy along and going to Indianapolis to spite him. When Andy returns, April finally forgives him and kisses him.

"Media Blitz" was written by Harris Wittels and directed by [[David Rogers (editor)|David Rogers]]. Like all of the first six [[Parks and Recreation (season 3)|third season]] episodes, it was written and filmed almost immediately after the [[Parks and Recreation (season 2)|second season]] ended as part of an early shooting schedule due to Amy Poehler's pregnancy. However, although finished early in anticipation of a September 2010 release date, ''Parks'' was ultimately placed on hiatus until early 2011, many months after production on "Media Blitz" was already finished.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b210757_why_parks_recreation_still_gone_show.html |title=Why Is ''Parks and Recreation'' Still Gone?!

In one scene, Leslie claims she unsuccessfully tried to contact [[Oprah Winfrey]], the popular billionaire television host, to seek publicity for the harvest festival. Upon failing to contact Winfrey, Leslie said, "I'm putting it out there, like ''[[The Secret (book)|The Secret]]'', and hopefully she'll call me."

{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right |width=200px |align=right | quote  = Right now, Parks and Recreation is in its golden period.

"Media Blitz" received generally positive reviews, with several commentators particularly praising the performance of Adam Scott,<ref name="Poniewozik" /><ref name="Porter" /><ref name="Sepinwall" /><ref name="Sundermann" /> although some said the subplot with Chris and Ann was less effective.<ref name="Meslow" /><ref name="AVClub" /><ref name="EW" /> ''[[TV Guide]]'' writer Damian Holbrook wrote, "''[[Party Down]]'' vet absolutely stole the show on ''Parks and Recreation''. ... Scott was a machine of mania, a dork gone wild, who gave the rapidly unraveling Ben just the right amount of crazy while completely cracking us up."<ref>{{cite news |last=Holbrook |first=Damian |title=Watercooler: Parks and Recreations' Great Scott |work=[[TV Guide]] |date=February 18, 2011 |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Watercooler-Parks-Recreations-1029595.aspx |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}</ref> Hollywood.com writer Eric Sundermann said "Media Blitz" continue a long period of excellent ''Parks and Recreation'' episodes, although he said the problems were resolved too quickly at the end of the episode. Sundermann said Scott's slightly over-the-top performance was made especially funny because he is normally such a [[straight man]] character.<ref name="Sundermann">{{cite news |last=Sundermann |first=Eric |title='Parks and Recreation' Recap: Media Blitz |publisher=Hollywood.com |date=February 18, 2011 |url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Parks_and_Recreation_Recap_Media_Blitz/7763406 |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}</ref> Alan Sepinwall of HitFix praised Scott for his ability to be both a straight man and a more outrageously funny character, as during his meltdowns in media interviews. Sepinwall also complimented Aubrey Plaza's performance and said the overall episode was very funny, but that the main storyline was resolved too quickly.<ref name="Sepinwall" />

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine writer [[James Poniewozik]] said the episode continued the development of the town of Pawnee, which he said was like a character itself and compared it to ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. Poniewozik said "Media Blitz" also showed how well integrated Scott has become with the cast, and called the "Crazy Ira and The Douche" interview "maybe the most perfect scene ''P&R'' has put together yet".<ref name="Poniewozik" /> Likewise, Steve Heisler of [[The A.V. Club]] called Ben's interview with Perd Hapley "one of the best scenes ''Parks & Rec'' has ever done". Heisler enjoyed how the series gradually built up Ben Wyatt's backstory throughout the season, "then took it ''way'' over-the-top". However, he expressed disappointment that the Ann and Chris subplot ended with no resolution.<ref name="AVClub" /> [[Zap2it]] writer Rick Porter, called the episode a "great showcase for Scott's deadpan gifts" and wrote, "This show hasn't had a real miss yet this season." Porter said the April and Andy subplot was less interesting, but he enjoyed the scenes between Ron and Andy.<ref name="Porter" /> Steve Kandell of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine praised the episode for bringing Scott's character to the forefront, as well as for providing satire on small-town politics without coming across as preachy. Kandell said of the April and Andy story, "If their kiss at the shoeshine stand, as expected and inevitable as it may have been, didn't make your heart soar just a little bit, then you're dead inside and probably just turned on NBC for ''[[Outsourced (TV series)|Outsourced]]'' a few minutes early."<ref>{{cite news |last=Kandell |first=Steve |title=Parks and Recreation Recap: The Spirit of Melancholy |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=February 18, 2011 |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/02/parks_and_recreation_recap_the_4.html |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}</ref> Joel Keller of [[Weblogs, Inc.#TV Squad|TV Squad]] complimented Scott, calling him a "current-generation [[Bob Newhart]]" and "one of those actors who can just give someone a look and it conveys everything you need to know about what his character is thinking". Keller said he also enjoyed seeing April and Andy reconcile, but felt the Crazy Ira and The Douche scene was ineffective because, regarding morning zoo radio shows, "it's hard to parody something that's already a parody of itself".<ref name="Keller" />

''[[The Atlantic]]'' writer Scott Meslow praised Scott's performance, as well as how the writers have "smartly underplayed" the relationship between Leslie and Ben. Meslow also liked that the April-Andy subplot was now resolved, as he called it the "weakest plotline of the season", but he felt the scenes between Chris and Ann in "Media Blitz" were a rehash of the previous episode.<ref name="Meslow" /> Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic praised Scott's performance, calling him a master at the straight man role, but said he was funnier the previous week in "Ron & Tammy: Part Two": "The laughs weren't as loud on "Media Blitz," as it was more of a squirm-inducing half hour of television."<ref name="Richenthal" /> Matt Fowler of [[IGN]] called it a fine episode that was "dominated, in a good way, by its softer, sweeter moments", particularly the kiss between Andy and April, which he said "was so damn sweet that I just couldn't resist it". Although he enjoyed the Perd Hapley interview, Fowler said he did not find Scott's performance otherwise especially funny.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fowler |first=Matt |title=Parks and Recreation: "Media Blitz" Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=February 17, 2011 |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/115/1150851p1.html |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' writer Hillary Busis also praised Scott's performance, adding, "Did anyone else's heart melt just a little bit at the proud smile that crept across Leslie<U+2019>s face when Ben found his voice?" Busis also said she was glad the April and Andy reconciled, as April's constant mistreatment of Andy was making it harder and harder to like her character. Busis criticized the Ann and Chris subplot, of which she said, "Wake me up when something actually happens."<ref name="EW" />
