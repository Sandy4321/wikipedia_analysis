'''''Fritz the Cat''''' is a 1972 American [[animated film]] written and directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]] as his feature film debut. Based on the [[comic strip]] [[Fritz the Cat|of the same name]] by [[Robert Crumb]], the film was the first animated feature film to receive an [[X rating]] in the United States. It focuses on Fritz (voiced by [[Skip Hinnant]]), an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] feline in mid-1960s New York City who explores the ideals of [[hedonism]] and sociopolitical consciousness. The film is a [[satire]] focusing on American college life of the era, race relations, the [[free love]] movement, and [[left-wing|left-]] and [[right-wing]] politics. ''Fritz the Cat'' is the most successful [[Independent animation|independent animated]] feature of all time, grossing over $100 million worldwide.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/>

After Bakshi graduated from [[High School of Art and Design]], he worked on cartoon shorts for [[Terrytoons|Terrytoon Studios]] for ten years and eventually started up his own animation studio. However, Bakshi was uninterested in the kind of animation he was producing, and wanted to produce something personal.<ref name="Barrier-1"/> He soon developed ''[[Heavy Traffic]]'', a tale of inner-city street life. However, producer [[Steve Krantz]] told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/> Later, Bakshi came across a copy of ''Fritz the Cat'' while browsing a bookstore. Impressed by Crumb's satire, Bakshi suggested to Krantz that it could be worked into a film.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-60"/>

The film had a troubled production history and controversial release. Crumb is known to have had disagreements with the filmmakers, claiming in interviews that his first wife signed over the film rights to the characters,<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-62"/> and that he did not approve the production. Crumb was also critical of the film's approach to his material.<ref name="Maremaa"/><ref name="Barrier-3"/><ref name="Barrier-5"/> ''Fritz the Cat'' was controversial for its rating and content, which many viewers at the time found to be offensive. Its success led to a slew of other X-rated animated films, and a sequel, ''[[The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat]]'', was made without Crumb's or Bakshi's involvement.

==Plot==
In a New York park, hippies have gathered with guitars to sing [[protest song]]s. Fritz and his friends show up in an attempt to meet girls. When a trio of attractive females walk by, Fritz and his friends exhaust themselves trying to get their attention, but find that the girls are more interested in the [[crow]] standing a few feet away. The girls attempt to flirt with the crow, making unintentionally condescending remarks about black people. Suddenly, the crow rebukes the girls and walks away. Fritz tries to pick up the girls by convincing them that he is a tormented soul, and invites them to "seek the truth", bringing them up to his friend's apartment, where a wild party is taking place. Since the other rooms are crowded, Fritz drags the girls into the bathroom and the four of them have [[group sex]] in the bathtub. Meanwhile, a police force of pigs arrive to raid the party. As the two officers walk up the stairs, one of the partygoers finds Fritz and the girls in the bath tub. Several others jump in, pushing Fritz to the side where he takes solace in [[marijuana]]. The two officers break into the apartment, but find that it is empty because everyone has moved into the bathroom. Fritz takes refuge in the toilet when one of the pigs enters the bathroom and begins to beat up the partygoers. As the pig becomes exhausted, a very intoxicated Fritz jumps out, grabs the pig's gun, and shoots the toilet, causing the water main to break and flooding everybody out of the apartment. The pigs chase Fritz down the street into a [[synagogue]]. He manages to escape when the congregation gets up to celebrate the United States' decision to send more weapons into [[Israel]].

Fritz makes it back to his dormitory, where his roommates ignore him. He sets all of his notes and books on fire. The fire spreads throughout the dorm, finally setting the entire building ablaze. In a bar in [[Harlem]], Fritz meets Duke the Crow at a billiard table. After narrowly avoiding getting into a fight with the bartender, Duke invites Fritz to "bug out". When Duke steals a car, Fritz is eager to join the illegal activity. Following a wild ride, Fritz drives the car off a bridge. Before the car crashes below, Duke saves Fritz's life. The two arrive at an apartment owned by Bertha, a former [[prostitute]] turned [[drug dealer]]. When Fritz arrives, she shoves several joints into his mouth. The marijuana increases his [[libido]], so he rushes off into an alley to have sex with Bertha. While having sex, he comes to a realization that he "must tell the people about the revolution!" He runs off into the city street and incites a riot, during which Duke is shot and killed, and Fritz is chased by several cops.

Fritz hides in an alley where his fox girlfriend, Winston Schwartz, finds him and drags him on a road trip to San Francisco. On the road, she stops at a [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurant, and disenchants Fritz by her refusal to go to unusual places. When the car runs out of gas in the middle of the desert, he decides to abandon her. He later meets up with Blue, a [[heroin]]-addicted rabbit biker. Along with Blue's horse girlfriend, Harriet, they take a ride to an underground hide-out where several other revolutionaries tell Fritz of their plan to blow up a power station. When Harriet tries to get Blue to leave, he hits her several times and ties her down with a chain. When Fritz objects to their treatment of her, he is hit in the face with a candle by the group's leader. The group throws Harriet onto a bed and rapes her. In the next scene, Harriet is sitting in a graveyard, naked and traumatized. Fritz puts a coat over her and gets into a car with the leader to drive out to the power plant. After setting the dynamite, Fritz suddenly has a change of heart. The leader lights the fuse and drives off as Fritz tries to get the dynamite out of its tight spot and fails. The dynamite explodes, blowing up both the power plant and Fritz. At a Los Angeles hospital, Harriet (disguised as a [[nun]]) and the girls from the New York park come to comfort him. It is in this scene that, as John Grant writes in his book ''Masters of Animation'', Fritz realizes that he should "stick to his original hedonist philosophy and let the rest of the world take care of itself."<ref name="Grant">{{cite book |last=Grant |first=John |others= |title=Masters of Animation |year=2001 |publisher=Watson-Guptill |isbn=0823030415 |pages=19<U+2013>20 |chapter=Ralph Bakshi }}</ref> In the final moments of the film, the audience sees Fritz have sexual intercourse with the girls from the park again, only this time in mid-air.

[[Ralph Bakshi]] majored in cartooning at the [[High School of Art and Design]]. He learned his trade at the [[Terrytoons]] studio in New York City, where he spent ten years animating characters such as [[Mighty Mouse]], [[Heckle and Jeckle]], and [[Deputy Dawg]]. At the age of 29, Bakshi was hired to head the animation division of [[Paramount Pictures]] as both writer and director, where he produced four experimental short films before the studio closed in 1967.<ref name="Cohen-81">{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc. |location=North Carolina |ISBN=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Ralph Bakshi's ''Fritz the Cat'' and ''Heavy Traffic'' |pages=81<U+2013>84 }}</ref> With producer [[Steve Krantz]], Bakshi founded his own studio, Bakshi Productions.

While browsing the East Side Book Store on [[St. Mark's Place (Manhattan)|St. Mark's Place]], Bakshi came across a copy of ''R. Crumb's [[Fritz the Cat]]''.

As Krantz began to prepare the paperwork, preparation began on a pitch presentation for potential studios, including a poster-sized painted cel setup featuring the strip's cast against a traced photo background, as Bakshi intended the film to appear.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-60"/> However, in spite of Crumb's enthusiasm, he was unsure about the film's production, and refused to sign the contract.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-60"/> Artist [[Vaughn Bod<U+00E9>]] warned Bakshi against working with Crumb, describing him as "slick".<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-60"/> Bakshi later agreed with Bod<U+00E9>'s assessment, calling Crumb "one of the slickest hustlers you'll ever see in your life".<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-60"/> Krantz sent Bakshi to San Francisco, where Bakshi stayed with Crumb and his wife, Dana, in an attempt to persuade Crumb to sign the contract.

===Funding and distribution===
With the rights to the character, Krantz and Bakshi set out to find a distributor. "When I say that every major distributor turned it down, this is not an exaggeration",<ref name="Barrier-3">{{cite journal |url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/FritzPartOne/FritzThree.htm |title=The Filming of ''Fritz the Cat'': Crumb, His Cat, and the Dotted Line |accessdate=2007-03-02 |author=[[Michael Barrier (historian)|Barrier, Michael]] |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=Spring 1972 |year= |month= |work=Funnyworld | issue=14 |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> remembers Krantz. "There has never been a project that was received with less enthusiasm. Animation is essentially a dirty word for distributors, who think that only [[Walt Disney|Disney]] can paint a tree, and in addition to that, ''Fritz'' was so far out that there was a failure to understand that we were onto something very important."<ref name="Barrier-1"/>

In the spring of 1970, [[Warner Bros.]] agreed to fund and distribute the film.<ref name="Cohen-81"/><ref name="NYT">{{cite web |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=COOL%20WORLD%20(MOVIE)&title2=&reviewer=JAMIE%20DIAMOND&pdate=&v_id= |title=Animation's Bad Boy Returns, Unrepentant |accessdate=2007-03-21 |author=Diamond, Jamie |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=July 5, 1992 |year= |month= |format= |work=New York Times |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> The first scenes completed were the Harlem sequences.

I'll remember their faces until I die. One of them left the room. Holy hell, you should have seen his face. 'Shut ''up'', Frank! This is not the movie you<U+2019>re allowed to make!'

Warner Bros. executives wanted the sexual content to be toned down, and for Bakshi and Krantz to cast celebrities as the voices. Bakshi refused, and Warner Bros. pulled their funding from the film, leading Krantz to seek funds elsewhere, eventually leading to a deal with Jerry Gross, the owner of [[Cinemation Industries]], a distributor specializing in [[exploitation film]]s. Although Bakshi did not have enough time to pitch the film, Gross agreed to fund its production and distribute it, believing that it would fit in with his [[grindhouse]] slate.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-62"/> Further financing came from [[Saul Zaentz]], who agreed to distribute the [[Fritz the Cat (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] on his [[Fantasy Records]] label.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-62"/>

===Directing===
[[File:RalphBakshiJan09.jpg|thumb|alt=Head and shoulders of a bearded older man in glasses. Smiling, with eyes nearly closed, he is wearing a plain sweater and holding a microphone.|Ralph Bakshi in January 2009]]
Bakshi was initially reluctant to direct ''Fritz the Cat'' because he had spent years working on animated productions featuring animal characters and wanted to make films focusing on human characters.<ref name="DirectorsSeries">{{cite web |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8744784132440773336&hl=en |title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi |accessdate=2007-03-16 |author=Gallagher, John A. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1983 |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> However, he became interested in working on the film because he loved Crumb's work and considered him a "total genius".<ref name="Cohen-81"/> During the development of the film, Bakshi says that he "started to get giddy" when he "suddenly was able to get a pig that was a cop, and this particular other pig was [[Jewish]], and I thought, 'Oh my God <U+2014> a Jewish pig?' These were major steps forward, because in the initial ''[[Heckle and Jeckle]]'' for Terrytoons, they were two black guys running around. Which was hysterically funny and, I think, great <U+2013> like [[Uncle Remus]] stuff. But they didn't play down south, and they had to change two black crows to two Englishmen. And I always told him that the black crows were funnier. So it was a slow awakening."<ref name="IGN">{{cite web |url=http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/518/518805p1.html |title=An Interview with Ralph Bakshi |accessdate=2007-04-27 |first=Ken |last=P. |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=May 25, 2004 |year= |month= |work= |publisher=IGN |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

In his notes to animator Cosmo Anzilotti, Bakshi is precise, and even specifies that the crows smoked marijuana rather than tobacco. Bakshi states that "The weed had to read on screen. It's an important character detail."<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-66">{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0789316846 |pages=66<U+2013>67|chapter=''Fritz the Cat'' }}</ref> The film's opening sequence sets the satirical tone of the film. The setting of the story's period is not only established by a title, but also by the voice of Bakshi himself, playing a character giving his account of the 1960s: "happy times, heavy times". The film's opening dialogue, by three construction workers on their lunch break, establishes many of the themes discussed in the film, including drug use, promiscuity, and the social and political climate of the era. When one of the workers urinates off of the scaffold, the film's credits play over a shot of the liquid falling against a black screen. When the credits end, it is shown that the construction worker has urinated on a long-haired hippie with a guitar. Karl F. Cohen writes that the film "is a product of the radical politics of the period. Bakshi's depiction of Fritz's life is colorful, funny, sexist, raw, violent and outrageous."<ref name="Cohen-81"/>

Of his direction of the film, Bakshi stated "My approach to animation as a director is live action. I don't approach it in the traditional animation ways. None of our characters get up and sing, because that's not the type of picture I'm trying to do. I want people to believe my characters are real, and it's hard to believe they're real if they start walking down the street singing."<ref name="Barrier-1"/> Bakshi wanted the film to be the [[antithesis]] of any animated film produced by [[the Walt Disney Company]].<ref name="Cohen-81"/> Accordingly, ''Fritz the Cat'' includes two satirical references to Disney. In one scene, silhouettes of [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Minnie Mouse]], and [[Donald Duck]] are shown cheering on the [[United States Air Force]] as it drops [[napalm]] on a black neighborhood during a riot. Another scene features a reference to the "[[Pink Elephants on Parade]]" sequence from ''[[Dumbo]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinepassion.org/Reviews/f/FritzCat.html |title=Cinepassion: Review of ''Fritz the Cat'' (1972) |accessdate=2007-04-06 |work= }}</ref> A sequence of the camera panning across a garbage heap in an abandoned lot in Harlem sets up a visual device which reoccurs in ''[[Hey Good Lookin' (film)|Hey Good Lookin']]''.<ref name="Miller"/>

===Writing===
The original screenplay consisted mostly of dialog and featured only a few changes from Crumb's stories. However, it<U+2014>and complete storyboards<U+2014>went largely unused in favor of more experimental storytelling techniques.<ref name="Barrier-5">{{cite journal |url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/FritzPartTwo/FritzFive.htm |title=The Filming of ''Fritz the Cat'': A Strange Breed of Cat |accessdate=2007-03-02 |author=[[Michael Barrier (historian)|Barrier, Michael]] |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=Fall 1973 |year= |month= |work=Funnyworld | issue=15 |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref><ref name="Barrier-4"/> Bakshi said, "I don't like to jump ahead on my films. The way you feel about a film on Day One, you may not feel the same way forty weeks down the road. Characters grow, so I wanted to have the option to change things, and strengthen my characters... It was sort of a stream of consciousness, and a learning process for myself."<ref name="Barrier-4"/> Bakshi attempted to lend realism to the material by writing the characters without any feral animal behavior.<ref name=Arrow>{{cite video | people      = Ralph Bakshi | date        = 2006 | title       = Interview | url         = | format      =  | medium      = ''The Fritz the Cat Collection'' DVD set, disc 3| publisher   = Arrow Films}}</ref>

The first part of the film's plot was adapted from a self-titled story published in a 1968 issue of ''R. Crumb's Head Comix'',<ref name="Barrier-5"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Crumb |first=Robert |author= |coauthors= |title=Fritz the Cat |year=1968 |publisher=R. Crumb's Head Comix |location= |isbn= }}</ref> while the second part is derived from "Fritz Bugs Out", which was serialized in the February to October 1968 issues of ''[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]]'',<ref name="Barrier-5"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Crumb |first=Robert |author= |coauthors= |title=Fritz Bugs Out |date=February to October 1968 |work=Cavalier |location= |isbn= }}</ref> and the final part of the story contains elements of "Fritz the No-Good", first published in the September/October 1968 issue of ''Cavalier''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Crumb |first=Robert |author= |coauthors= |title=Fritz the No-Good |date=September/October 1968 |work=Cavalier |location= |isbn= }}</ref> The last half of the film makes a major departure from Crumb's work. Animation historian [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]] describes this section of the film as being "much grimmer than Crumb's stories past that point, and far more violent."<ref name="Barrier-5"/> Bakshi stated that he deviated from the comics because he felt that the strips lacked depth:

<blockquote>"It was cute, it was sweet, but there was nowhere to put it. That's why Crumb hates the picture, because I slipped a couple of things in there that he despises, like the rabbis<U+2014>the pure Jewish stuff. Fritz can't hold that kind of commentary. Winston is 'just a typical Jewish broad from Brooklyn.' [...] [The strip] was cute and well-done, but there was nothing that had that much depth."<ref>{{cite web |last=Heater |first=Brian |title=Interview: Ralph Bakshi Pt. 2 |url=http://thedailycrosshatch.com/2008/06/30/interview-ralph-bakshi-pt-2/ |date=June 30, 2008 |work=The Daily Cross Hatch |accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref></blockquote>

Bakshi's unwillingness to use anthropomorphic characters that behaved like feral animals led him to rewrite a scene in "Fritz Bugs Out" where Duke saves Fritz's life by flying while holding Fritz; in the film, Duke grabs a railing before the car crashes into the river, a solution that Bakshi wasn't entirely satisfied with, but prevented him from having to use any feral animal behavior in that scene.<ref name=Arrow/>

In the film, there are two characters named "Winston" <U+2013> one appears at the beginning and end of the film, the other is Fritz's girlfriend Winston Schwartz. Michael Barrier notes that Winston Schwartz (who appears prominently in "Fritz Bugs Out" and "Fritz the No-Good") never has a proper introduction in Bakshi's film, and interprets the naming of a separate character as Bakshi's attempt to reconcile this; however, the two characters look and sound nothing alike.<ref name="Barrier-5"/> Bakshi intended to end the film with Fritz's death, but Krantz objected to this ending, and Bakshi eventually changed it to the final ending.<ref name=Arrow/>

Almost all of the film's dialogue, except for that of a few of the main characters, was recorded entirely on the streets of New York City.<ref name="Bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphbakshi.com/bio.php |title=Biography |accessdate=2007-03-02 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Ralph Bakshi.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> For the film's opening sequence, Bakshi paid two construction workers US$50 each, and drank [[Scotch whisky|Scotch]] with them, recording the conversation.<ref name="Miller"/> In the Washington Square Park sequence, only Skip Hinnant was a professional actor; Fritz's friends were voiced by young males Bakshi found in the park.<ref name="Miller"/> One of the sequences that was not based upon Crumb's comics involved a comic chase through a [[synagogue]] full of praying [[rabbi]]s. For the voices of the rabbis, Bakshi used a documentary recording of his father and uncles. This scene continued to have a personal significance on Bakshi after his father and uncle died. Bakshi states, "Thank God I have their voices. I have my dad and family praying. It's so nice to hear now."<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-66"/> Bakshi also went to a [[Harlem]] bar with a tape recorder and spent hours talking to black patrons, getting drunk with them as he asked them questions.<ref name="Barrier-4"/>

The film's score was composed by [[Ed Bogas]] and [[Ray Shanklin]]. The film also featured songs by [[Cal Tjader]], [[Bo Diddley]], and [[Billie Holiday]]. Bakshi bought the rights to use Holiday's performance of the song "Yesterdays" for $35.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fulvuedrive-in.com/interview/1032/RALPH+BAKSHI+INTERVIEW |title=Ralph Bakshi on the recent DVD release of ''Wizards'' |accessdate=2007-03-06 |author=Simmons, Stephanie |authorlink= |coauthors=Simmons, Areya |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Fulvue Drive-In |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

===Animation===

The background is a watercolor painting based on a tracing from a photograph, giving the film a stylized realism virtually unprecedented in animation.]]
Many of the animators who worked on the film were professionals that Bakshi had previously worked with at Terrytoons, including Jim Tyer, John Gentilella, Nick Tafuri, [[Martin Taras]], Larry Riley, and Cliff Augustine.<ref name="Beck">{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Animated Movie Guide |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location= |pages=88<U+2013>89 |isbn=9781556525919 }}</ref> According to Bakshi, it took quite a long time to assemble the right staff. Those who entered with a smirk, "wanting to be very dirty and draw filthy pictures", did not stay very long, and neither did those with a low tolerance for vulgarity. One cartoonist refused to draw a [[African-American|black]] crow shooting a pig policeman. Two female animators quit; one because she could not bring herself to tell her children what she did for a living, the other because she refused to draw exposed breasts.<ref name="Kanfer">{{cite book |last=Kanfer |first=Stefan |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Serious Business: The Art and Commerce of Animation in America from Betty Boop to Toy Story |year=2001 |publisher=Da Capo |location= |isbn=9780306809187|page=204 }}</ref>

In order to save money by eliminating the need for model sheets, Bakshi let animator John Sparey draw some of the first sequences of Fritz. Bakshi states that he knew that "Sparey would execute them beautifully." Poses from his sequences were photocopied and handed out to the rest of the crew.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/> The film was produced almost entirely without [[Pencil test (animation)|pencil tests]]. According to Bakshi, "We pencil tested I'd say a thousand feet [of footage], tops. [...] We do a major feature without pencil tests<U+2014>that's tough. The timing falls off. I can always tell an animator to draw it better, and I know if the attitude of the characters is right, but the timing you really can't see." Bakshi had to judge the timing of the animation simply by flipping an animator's drawings in his hand, until he could see the completed animation on the screen.<ref name="Barrier-1"/> Veteran Warner Bros. animator Ted Bonnicksen was incredibly dedicated to his work on the film, to the point where he completed his animation for the synagogue sequence while suffering from leukemia, and would take the scenes home at night to work on them.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-66"/>

In May 1971, Bakshi moved his studio to Los Angeles to hire additional animators there. Some animators, including [[Rod Scribner]], [[Dick Lundy (animator)|Dick Lundy]], [[Virgil Walter Ross]], [[Norman McCabe]] and [[John Sparey]], welcomed Bakshi's presence, and felt that ''Fritz the Cat'' would bring diversity to the animation industry.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-72"/> Other animators disliked Bakshi's presence, and placed an advertisement in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', stating that Bakshi's "filth" was unwelcome in California.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-72">{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0789316846 |pages=72|chapter=''Fritz the Cat'' }}</ref> According to Bakshi, "I didn't know who these guys were because I was from New York, so I threw the ad away."<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue4.04/4.04pages/bakshidrawing.php3 |title=Draw What You Want To Draw |accessdate=2007-04-27 |last=Bakshi |first=Ralph |authorlink= |coauthors= |month=July | year=1999 |format= |work=Animation World | issue=4.4 |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> However, Bakshi found the negative reaction to the film from his peers to be disheartening.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-72"/>

===Cinematography===
Because it was cheaper for Ira Turek to trace photographs to create the backgrounds, Ralph Bakshi and Johnnie Vita walked around the streets of the [[Lower East Side]], [[Washington Square Park, New York|Washington Square Park]], [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] and [[Harlem]] to take moody snapshots. Turek inked the outlines of these photographs onto cels with a [[Rotring|Rapidograph]], the [[technical pen]] preferred by Crumb, giving the film's backgrounds stylized realism that had never been portrayed in animation before.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/> After Turek completed a background drawing in ink on an animation cel, the drawing would be photocopied onto watercolor paper for Vita and onto animation paper for use in matching the characters to the backgrounds. When Vita finished his painting, Turek's original drawing, on the cel, would be placed over the watercolor, obscuring the photocopy lines on the painting.<ref name="Barrier-4"/> However, not every background was taken from live-action sources.<ref name="Funnyworld-2">{{cite journal |url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/FritzPartTwo/FritzFour.htm |title=The Filming of ''Fritz the Cat'', Part Two |accessdate=2007-03-02 |author=[[Michael Barrier (historian)|Barrier, Michael]] |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=Fall 1973 |year= |month= |work=Funnyworld | issue=15 |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> The tones of the watercolor backgrounds were influenced by the "[[Ashcan School|Ash Can style]]" of painters, which includes [[George Luks]] and [[John French Sloan]].<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-77">{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0789316846 |pages=77<U+2013>78|chapter=''Fritz the Cat'' }}</ref> The film also used bent and [[Fisheye lens|fisheye]] camera perspectives in order to replicate the way the film's hippies and hoodlums viewed the city.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-77"/>

==Rating==
By the time the film wrapped production, Cinemation had released [[Melvin Van Peebles]]' ''[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song]]'' to considerable success, and the distributor hoped that ''Fritz the Cat'' would be even more profitable. ''Fritz the Cat'' received an [[X-rated|X rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]], the first animated film to receive this rating.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-80">{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0789316846 |pages=80<U+2013>81|chapter=''Fritz the Cat'' }}</ref> Steve Krantz stated that the film lost playdates due to the rating, and 30 American newspapers rejected display ads for the film or refused to give it editorial publicity.<ref name="Cohen-81"/> The film's limited screenings led Cinemation to exploit the film's content in its promotion of the film, advertising the film as containing "90 minutes of violence, excitement, and SEX...he's X-rated and animated!"<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-80"/> According to Ralph Bakshi, "We almost didn't deliver the picture, because of the exploitation of it."<ref name="Barrier-1"/>

Cinemation's exploitative advertising style and the film's rating led many to believe that ''Fritz the Cat'' was a [[pornographic film]]. When the film was introduced at a showing at the [[University of Southern California]] as animated pornography, Bakshi stated firmly, "''Fritz the Cat'' is not pornographic."<ref name="Barrier-1"/> In May 1972, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Krantz had appealed the X rating, saying "Animals having sex isn't pornography." The MPAA refused to hear the appeal.<ref name="Cohen-81"/> The misconceptions about the film's content were eventually cleared up when it received praise from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'', and the film was accepted into the [[1972 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-80"/> Bakshi later stated "Now they do as much on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' as I got an X rating for ''Fritz the Cat''."<ref name="UGO">{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmtv/features/ralphbakshi/interview.asp |title=Ralph Bakshi Interview |accessdate=2007-04-27 |first=Daniel Robert |last=Epstein |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=UGO.com Film/TV |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

Before the film's release, American distributors attempted to cash in on the publicity garnered from the rating by rushing out dubbed versions of two other [[adult animation]]s from Japan, both of which featured an X rating in their advertising material: ''Senya ichiya monogatari'' and ''Kureopatora'', retitled ''[[One Thousand and One Arabian Nights (film)|One Thousand and One Arabian Nights]]'' and ''[[Cleopatra (1970 film)|Cleopatra: Queen of Sex]]'', respectively. However, neither film was actually submitted to the MPAA, and it is not likely that either feature would have received an X rating.<ref name="Barrier-1"/> The film ''[[Down and Dirty Duck]]'' was promoted with an X rating, but had not been submitted to the MPAA.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc. |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Charles Swenson's ''Dirty Duck'' |pages=89<U+2013>90 }}</ref> The French/Belgian animated film ''[[Tarzoon: Shame of the Jungle]]'' was initially released with an X rating in a subtitled version, but a dubbed version released in 1979 received an R rating.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc. |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Importing foreign productions |page=91 }}</ref>

==Release and Critical Reception==
''Fritz the Cat'' was released on April 12, 1972, opening in [[Hollywood]] and Washington, D.C.,<ref name="Barrier-3"/> Although the film only had a limited release, it went on to become a worldwide hit.<ref name=Arrow/> It grossed over $100 million worldwide, and was the most successful [[Independent animation|independent animated]] feature of all time.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/> Critical reaction to the film was positive. [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film is "constantly funny [...] [There's] something to offend just about everyone."<ref name="Cohen-81"/> ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine film critic [[Judith Crist]] wrote that "Like Crumb, Bakshi and producer Steve Krantz have captured the funk and the fraud and the foible and resorted to outrageous laughter to stifle the scream. [...] ''Fritz the Cat'' is a ball for the open mind."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crist |first=Judith |date=Apr 17, 1972 |title=A New Breed of Cat |journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |volume=5 |issue=16 |page=80 |accessdate=2009-06-22 |issn=00287369 }}</ref> Paul Sargent Clark in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called the film "powerful and audacious",<ref name="Cohen-81"/> while ''[[Newsweek]]'' called it "a harmless, mindless, pro-youth saga calculated to shake up only the box office."<ref name="Cohen-81"/> ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''Cue'' both gave the film mixed reviews.<ref name="Cohen-81"/> Two reviews appeared in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', the first praising it, while the second review, published after Crumb distanced himself from the film, criticized it.<ref name=Arrow/> Film website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the film a score of 56%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fritz_the_cat/ |title=Fritz the Cat |accessdate=2007-03-02 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

In Michael Barrier's 1972 article on the film's production, Bakshi gives his accounts of two separate screenings of the film. Of the reactions to the film by audiences at a preview screening in Los Angeles, Bakshi stated "They forget it's animation. They treat it like a film. [...] This is the real thing, to get people to take animation seriously." Bakshi was also present at a showing of the film at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and remembers "Some guy asked me why I was against the revolution. The point is, animation was making people get up off their asses and get mad."<ref name="Barrier-1"/>

The film also sparked negative reactions because of its content. "A lot of people got freaked out", says Bakshi. "The people in charge of the power structure, the people in charge of magazines and the people going to work in the morning who loved Disney and [[Norman Rockwell]], thought I was a pornographer, and they made things very difficult for me. The younger people, the people who could take new ideas, were the people I was addressing. I wasn't addressing the whole world. To those people who loved it, it was a huge hit, and everyone else wanted to kill me."<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1841791,00.html |title=Who flamed Roger Rabbit? |accessdate=2007-03-02 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=August 11, 2006 |year= |month= |work=The Guardian |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= | location=London | first=Steve | last=Rose}}</ref>

=== Crumb's response ===

Robert Crumb first saw the film in February 1972, during a visit to Los Angeles in the company of fellow underground cartoonists [[Spain Rodriguez]], [[S. Clay Wilson]], [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], and [[Rick Griffin]]. According to Bakshi, all but Crumb liked the film.<ref name=Arrow/> Crumb told Bakshi that he disliked the film. Among his criticisms, he said that he felt that Skip Hinnant was wrong for the voice of Fritz, and said that Bakshi should have voiced the character instead.<ref name=Arrow/> Crumb later said in an interview that he felt that the film was "really a reflection of Ralph Bakshi's confusion, you know. There's something real repressed about it. In a way, it's more twisted than my stuff. It's really twisted in some kind of weird, unfunny way. [...] I didn't like that sex attitude in it very much. It's like real repressed horniness; he's kind of letting it out compulsively."<ref name="Barrier-5"/> Crumb also took issue with the film's condemnation of the radical [[left-wing|left]],<ref name="Barrier-3"/> denouncing Fritz's dialogue in the final sequences of the film as "red-neck and fascistic"<ref name="Maremaa">{{cite book |last1=Maremaa |first1=Thomas |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first=D.

Reportedly, Crumb filed suit to have his name removed from the film's credits.<ref name="Umphlett">{{cite book |last=Umphlett |first=Wiley Lee |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=From Television to the Internet: Postmodern Visions of American Media Culture in the Twentieth Century |year=2006 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |location= |isbn=9780838640807|page=134 }}</ref> San Francisco copyright attorney Albert L.

The last time I saw it was when I was making an appearance at a German art school in the mid-1980s, and I was forced to watch it with the students. It was an excruciating ordeal, a humiliating embarrassment. I recall [[Victor Moscoso]] was the only one who warned me, 'if you don't stop this film from being made, you are going to regret it for the rest of your life'<U+2014>and he was right."<ref name="Crumbhandbook">{{cite book | title = The R. Crumb Handbook | first = Robert | last = Crumb| coauthors = Poplaski, Peter | year = | publisher = M Q Publications | isbn = 978-1840727166}}</ref>

In a 2008 interview, Bakshi referred to Crumb as a "hustler" and stated that "He goes in so many directions that he's hard to pin down. I spoke to him on the phone. We both had the same deal, five percent. They finally sent Crumb the money and not me. Crumb always gets what he wants, including that ch<U+00E2>teau of his in France. [...] I have no respect for Crumb. Is he a good artist? Yes, if you want to do the same thing over and over. He should have been my best friend for what I did with ''Fritz the Cat''. I drew a good picture, and we both made out fine."<ref name="BlackBook"/> Bakshi also stated that Crumb threatened to disassociate himself from any cartoonist that worked with Bakshi, which would have hurt their chances at getting work published.<ref>{{cite web |last=Heater |first=Brian |title=Interview: Ralph Bakshi Pt. 4 |url=http://thedailycrosshatch.com/2008/07/15/interview-ralph-bakshi-pt-4-of-4/ |date=July 15, 2008 |work=The Daily Cross Hatch |accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Bakshi states that he felt constricted using anthropomorphic characters in ''Fritz the Cat'', and focused solely on non-anthropomorphic characters in ''Heavy Traffic'' and ''Hey Good Lookin<nowiki>'</nowiki>'', but later used anthropomorphic characters in ''[[Coonskin (film)|Coonskin]]''.<ref name="Miller"/> While the film is widely noted in its innovation for featuring content that had not been portrayed in animation before, such as explicit sexuality and violence, the film was also, as John Grant writes in his book ''Masters of Animation'', "the breakthrough movie that opened brand new vistas to the commercial animator in the United States",<ref name="Grant"/> presenting an "almost disturbingly accurate" portrayal "of a particular stratum of Western society during a particular era, [...] as such it has dated very well."<ref name="Grant"/> The film's subject matter and its satirical approach offered an alternative to the kinds of films that had previously been presented by major animation studios.<ref name="Grant"/> Michael Barrier described ''Fritz the Cat'' and ''Heavy Traffic'' as "not merely provocative, but highly ambitious." Barrier described the films as an effort "to push beyond what was done in the old cartoons, even while building on their strengths."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barrier |first1=Michael |title=Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |isbn=0195167295 |page=572 |chapter= }}</ref> ''Fritz the Cat'' was selected by ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' magazine as the 42nd greatest animated film,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adams, Derek; Calhoun, Dave; Davies, Adam Lee; Fairclough, Paul; Huddleston, Tom; Jenkins, David; Ward, Ossian |year=2009 |title=Time Out's 50 greatest animated films, with added commentary by Terry Gilliam |journal=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/features/show-feature/8835/time-outs-50-greatest-animated-films-curated-by-terry-gilliam.html |accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref> ranked at number 51 on the [[Online Film Critics Society]]'s list of the top 100 greatest animated films of all time,<ref name="OFCS">{{cite web |url=http://ofcs.rottentomatoes.com/pages/pr/top100animated |title=Top 100 Animated Features of All Time |accessdate=2007-03-02 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Online Film Critics Society]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> and was placed at number 56 on [[Channel 4]]'s list of the ''[[100 Greatest Cartoons]]''.<ref name="Channel4">{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/cartoons/results.html |title=Top 100 Cartoons |accessdate=2008-01-28 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=Channel 4 |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Footage from the film was edited into the music video for [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]]'s 2007 song "State of Clarity".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/home.nsf/webpages/gurux05x06x07 |title=Guru, feat Common, State of Clarity, Video |accessdate=2007-10-06 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Contact Music |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

In addition to other animated films aimed at adult audiences, the film's success led to the production of a sequel, ''[[The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat]]''. Although producer Steve Krantz and voice actor Skip Hinnant returned to work on the follow-up, Ralph Bakshi did not. Instead, ''Nine Lives'' was directed by animator Robert Taylor, who cowrote the film with Fred Halliday and [[Eric Monte]]. ''The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat'' was distributed by [[American International Pictures]], and was considered to be inferior to its predecessor.<ref name="Grant"/> Both films are currently available on DVD in the United States and Canada from [[MGM Home Entertainment]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/Fritz-Cat-Skip-Hinnant/dp/B00003CWQI/ |title=ASIN: B00003CWQI |accessdate=2007-03-02 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> and from [[Arrow Films]] in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fritz-Cat-Nine-Lives/dp/B000EMTJP6/ |title=ASIN: B000EMTJP6 |accessdate=2007-03-02 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.uk]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>
