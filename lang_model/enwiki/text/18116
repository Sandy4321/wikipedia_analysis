The '''Confederate government of Kentucky''' was a [[shadow government]] established for the [[Commonwealth (United States)|Commonwealth]] of [[Kentucky]] by a self-constituted group of Southern sympathizers during the [[American Civil War]]. The shadow government never replaced the elected government in [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]], which had strong Union sympathies. Neither did it gain the support of Kentucky's citizens; its jurisdiction extended only as far as Confederate battle lines in the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, the provisional government was recognized by the [[Confederate States of America]], and Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on [[December 10]], [[1861]].

[[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] was designated the Confederate capital of Kentucky, but due to the military situation in the state, the provisional government was exiled and traveled with the [[Army of Tennessee]] for most of its existence. For a short time in the autumn of 1862, the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] controlled Frankfort, the only time a Union capital was captured by Confederate forces. During this occupation, General [[Braxton Bragg]] attempted to install the provisional government as the permanent authority in the Commonwealth. However, Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]] ambushed the inauguration ceremony and drove the provisional government from the state for the final time. From that point forward, the government existed primarily on paper, and was dissolved at the end of the war.

The provisional government elected two governors. [[George W. Johnson (Civil War)|George W. Johnson]] was elected at the Russellville Convention and served until his death at the [[Battle of Shiloh]]. [[Richard Hawes]] was elected to replace Johnson, and served through the remainder of the war.

==Background==
Kentucky's citizens were split regarding the issues central to the Civil War. The state had strong economic ties with [[Ohio River]] cities such as [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] while at the same time sharing many cultural, social, and economic links with the South. Unionist traditions were strong throughout the Commonwealth's history, and with economic ties to both the North and the South, Kentucky had little to gain and much to lose from a war between the states. Additionally, many slaveholders felt that the best protection for [[slavery]] was within the Union. The presidential election of 1860 reflected Kentucky<U+2019>s mixed heritage when the state gave [[Joshua Fry Bell]] 45% of the popular vote, [[John C. Breckinridge]] 36%, [[Stephen Douglas]] 18%, and [[Abraham Lincoln]] less than 1%.  Historian Allan Nevins interpreted the election results to mean that Kentuckians strongly opposed both secession and coercion against the secessionists. The majority coalition of Bell and Douglas supporters was seen as a solid moderate Unionist position that opposed precipitate action by extremists on either side.<ref name=nevins>{{cite book |last=Nevins |first=Allen |title=The War for the Union: The Improvised War 1861-1862 |publisher=Charles Scribner<U+2019>s Sons |year=1959 |isbn=684104261}}</ref>

[[Image:BreckTT.jpg|thumb|right|1860 Presidential candidate John Breckinridge represented the states rights position.]]
The majority of Kentucky's citizens felt it was their role to be a mediator between the North and South. On [[December 9]], [[1860]], [[Governor of Kentucky|Kentucky Governor]] [[Beriah Magoffin]] sent a letter to the other slave state governors suggesting that they come to an agreement with the North that would include strict enforcement of the [[Fugitive Slave Act]], a division of common territories at the 37th parallel, a guarantee of free use of the Mississippi River, and a Southern [[veto]] over slave legislation. Magoffin proposed a conference of slave states, followed by a conference of all the states to secure these concessions. Due to the escalating pace of events, neither conference was ever held.<ref name=harrison-cwky />

Governor Magoffin called a special session of the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] on [[December 27]], [[1860]], asking the legislators to call a convention of Kentuckians to decide the Commonwealth's course in the sectional conflict.<ref name=harrison-cwky>{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Lowell H. |authorlink=Lowell H.

The historic moment once past, never returns. For us and for Kentucky, the time to act is NOW OR NEVER."<ref>Shortridge, p. 290</ref> The Unionists, on the other hand, were unwilling to surrender the fate of the state to a convention that might "in a moment of excitement, adopt the extreme remedy of secession."<ref>Heck, p. 333</ref> The Unionist position carried when many of the states rights legislators, opposing the idea of immediate secession, voted against the convention.<ref name=shortridge>{{cite journal |last=Shortridge |first=William Porter |title=Kentucky Neutrality in 1861 |journal=The Mississippi Valley Historical Review |volume=9 |issue=4 |month=March |year=1923}}</ref> The assembly did, however, send six delegates to a [[February 4]] [[Peace Conference of 1861|Peace Conference]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and asked [[United States Congress|Congress]] to call a national convention to consider potential resolutions to the secession crisis, including the [[Crittenden Compromise]], authored by Kentuckian [[John J. Crittenden]]. 

As a result of the firing on [[Fort Sumter]], President Lincoln sent a [[telegram]] to Governor Magoffin requesting that the Commonwealth supply four regiments as its share of the overall request of 75,000 troops for the war.<ref name=harrison /> Magoffin, a Southern sympathizer, replied "President Lincoln, [[Washington, D.C.]] I will send not a man nor a dollar for the wicked purpose of subduing my sister [[Southern United States|Southern states]].

In a special congressional election held [[June 20]], [[1861]], Unionist candidates won nine of Kentucky's ten congressional seats.<ref name=rose /> Confederate sympathizers won only the [[Jackson Purchase]] region,<ref name=rose /> which was economically linked to Tennessee by the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Tennessee River]]s.<ref name=kleber-cw>{{cite book |editor=Kleber, John E. |others=Associate editors: [[Thomas D.

Klotter |title=''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'' |year=1992 |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, Kentucky |isbn=0813117720 |chapter=Civil War}}</ref> Believing defeat at the polls was certain, many Southern Rightists had boycotted the election; of the 125,000 votes cast, Unionists captured close to 90,000.<ref name=harrison-cwky /> Southern sympathizers were dealt a further blow in the [[August 5]] election for state legislators. This election resulted in [[veto]]-proof Unionist majorities of 76&ndash;24 in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives|House]] and 27&ndash;11 in the [[Kentucky Senate|Senate]].<ref name=rose /> From that time forward, most of Magoffin's vetoes to protect southern interests were overridden in the General Assembly.<ref name=rose />

Historian Wilson Porter Shortridge made the following analysis of the election results:
{{cquote|These elections demonstrated that a majority of the people of Kentucky were opposed to secession, but they could not be interpreted as an approval of the war policy of the Lincoln administration, as was quite generally done at the north at that time.  Perhaps the best explanation at that time was that the people of Kentucky desired peace and thought that the election of the union candidates was the best way to get it.<ref>Shortridge, p. 297</ref>}}

With actual secession no longer considered to be a viable option, the pro-Confederate forces became the strongest supporters for neutrality, although Unionists simply dismissed this as a front for their true secessionist agenda.  Unionists, on the other hand, struggled to find a way to move the large, moderate middle to a <U+201C>definite and unqualified stand with the Washington government.<U+201D> The maneuvering between the two finally reached a decisive point on [[September 3]] when Confederate forces were ordered from Tennessee to the Kentucky towns of [[Hickman, Kentucky|Hickman]] and [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]], and Union forces responded by occupying [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]].<ref name=shortridge />

On [[September 11]] the legislature passed a resolution instructing Magoffin to order the Confederate forces (but not the Union forces) to leave the state. The Governor vetoed the resolution, but the General Assembly overrode his veto, and Magoffin gave the order. The next week, the assembly officially requested the assistance of the Union and asked the governor to call out the state militia to join the Federal forces. Magoffin also vetoed this request, and again the assembly overrode the veto, and Magoffin acquiesced.<ref name=shortridge />

==Formation==
A pro-Confederate peace meeting, with Breckinridge scheduled as a speaker, was scheduled for [[September 21]]. Unionists feared the meeting would lead to actual military resistance, and dispatched troops from [[Camp Dick Robinson]] to disband the meeting and arrest Breckinridge.<ref name=heck>{{cite journal |last=Heck |first=Frank H. |title=John C. Breckinridge in the Crisis of 1860-1861 |journal=The Journal of Southern History |volume=21 |issue=3 |month=August |year=1955}}</ref> Breckinridge, as well as many other state leaders identified with the secessionists, fled the state. These leaders eventually served as the nucleus for a group that would create a shadow government for Kentucky. In his [[October 8]], [[1861]], "Address to the People of Kentucky," Breckinridge declared, "The [[United States of America|United States]] no longer exists. The Union is dissolved."<ref>Brown, p. 80</ref>

On [[October 29]], [[1861]], 63 delegates representing 34 [[List of counties in Kentucky|counties]] met at [[Russellville, Kentucky]] to discuss the formation of a Confederate government for the Commonwealth.<ref name=brown>{{cite book |title=The Civil War in Kentucky: Battle for the Bluegrass |editor=Kent Masterson Brown |chapter=The Government of Confederate Kentucky |pages=pp. 69&ndash;98 |publisher=Savas Publishing Company |location=[[Mason City, Iowa]] |year=2000 |isbn=1882810473}}</ref> Despite recent defeats at the polls, this group had deluded themselves into believing that the Unionist government in Frankfort did not represent the will of the majority of Kentucky's citizens.<ref name=harrison /> [[Trigg County, Kentucky|Trigg County]]'s [[Henry Cornelius Burnett|Henry Burnett]] was elected chairman of the proceedings.<ref name=brown /> [[Scott County, Kentucky|Scott County]] farmer George W.

The first item of business was the ratification of an [[ordinance of secession]], which proceeded in short order.<ref name=cantrell /> Next, being unable to flesh out a complete constitution and system of laws, the delegates voted that "the [[Kentucky Constitution|Constitution]] and laws of Kentucky, not inconsistent with the acts of this Convention, and the establishment of this Government, and the laws which may be enacted by the Governor and Council, shall be the laws of this state."<ref name=cantrell /> The provisional government proposed by the delegates consisted of a legislative council of ten members (one from each Kentucky congressional district), a governor, who had the power to appoint judicial and other officials, a treasurer and an auditor.<ref name=brown /> The delegates designated Bowling Green (then under the control of Confederate general [[Albert Sidney Johnston]]) as the Confederate State capital, but had the foresight to provide that the government could meet anywhere deemed appropriate by the council and governor.<ref name=cantrell /> The convention adopted a new [[state seal]], an arm wearing [[Mail (armour)|mail]] with a star, extended from a circle of twelve other stars.<ref name=kye-gov />

The convention unanimously elected Johnson as governor.<ref name=kye-gov /> There is also some indication that [[Horatio F.

On [[November 21]], the day following the convention, Johnson wrote Confederate president [[Jefferson Davis]] to request Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy.<ref name=rose /> Burnett, [[William Preston (Kentucky)|William Preston]], and [[William E.

==Activity==
On [[November 26]], [[1861]], Governor Johnson issued an address to the citizens of the Commonwealth blaming [[abolitionist]]s for the breakup of the [[United States of America|United States]].<ref name=rose>{{cite book |title=Kentucky's Civil War 1861 &ndash; 1865 |editor=Jerlene Rose |publisher=Back Home in Kentucky, Inc. |location=[[Clay City, Kentucky]] |year=2005 |isbn=0976923122 |chapter=George W.

[[Image:Gwjohnson ky.jpg|thumb|left|[[George W. Johnson (Civil War)|George W. Johnson]], the first Confederate governor of Kentucky]]
During the winter of 1861, Johnson tried to assert the legitimacy of the fledgling government but its jurisdiction extended only as far as the area controlled by the Confederate Army.<ref name=rose /> Johnson came short of raising the 46,000 troops requested by the Confederate Congress.<ref name=rose /> Efforts to levy taxes and to compel citizens to turn over their guns to the government were similarly unsuccessful.<ref name=rose /> On [[January 3]], [[1862]], Johnson requested a sum of $3 million from the Confederate Congress to meet the provisional government's operating expenses.<ref name=cantrell /> The Congress instead approved a sum of $2 million, the expenditure of which required approval of Secretary of War [[Judah P. Benjamin]] and President Davis.<ref name=cantrell /> Much of the provisional government's operating capital was probably provided by Kentucky congressman [[Eli Metcalfe Bruce]], who made a fortune from varied economic activities throughout the war.<ref name=cantrell />

The council met on [[December 14]] to appoint representatives to the Confederacy's [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] provisional congress.<ref name=brown /> Those appointed would serve for only two months, as the provisional congress was replaced with a permanent [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature on [[February 17]], [[1862]].<ref name=brown /> Kentucky was entitled to two senators and 12 representatives in the permanent Confederate Congress.<ref name=cantrell /> The usual day for general elections being passed, Governor Johnson and the legislative council set election day for Confederate Kentucky on [[January 22]], [[1862]].<ref name=cantrell /> Voters were allowed to vote in whichever county they occupied on election day, and could cast a general ballot for all positions.<ref name=cantrell /> In an election that saw military votes outnumber civilian ones, only four of the provisional legislators were elected to seats in the Confederate House of Representatives.<ref name=cantrell /> One provisional legislator, Henry Burnett, was elected to the Confederate Senate.<ref name=cantrell /> 

The provisional government took other minor actions during the winter of 1861. An act was passed to rename [[Wayne County, Kentucky|Wayne County]] to Zollicoffer County in honor [[Felix Zollicoffer]], who died at the [[Battle of Mill Springs]].<ref name=brown /> Local officials were appointed in areas controlled by Confederate forces, including many [[justice of the peace|justices of the peace]].<ref name=rose /> When the Confederate government eventually disbanded, the legality of marriages performed by these justices was questioned, but eventually upheld.<ref name=rose />

===Withdrawal from Kentucky and death of Governor Johnson===
Following [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Fort Henry]], General Johnston withdrew from Bowling Green into [[Tennessee]] on [[February 7]], [[1862]]. A week later, Governor Johnson and the provisional government followed. On [[March 12]], the ''[[The Times-Picayune|New Orleans Picayune]]'' reported that "the capital of Kentucky [is] now being located in a Sibley tent."<ref name=rose />

Governor Johnson, despite his age (50) and a crippled arm,<ref name=kye-johnson>{{cite book |editor=Kleber, John E. |others=Associate editors: [[Thomas D. Clark]], Lowell H. Harrison, and James C. Klotter |title=''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'' |year=1992 |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |location=[[Lexington, Kentucky]] |isbn=0813117720 |chapter=Johnson, George W. |pages=p. 473}}</ref> volunteered to serve under General [[John C. Breckinridge]] and Colonel Robert P. Trabue at the [[Battle of Shiloh]].<ref name=harrison /> On [[April 7]], [[1862]], Johnson was severely wounded in the thigh and abdomen, and lay on the battlefield until the following day.<ref name=harrison /> Johnson was recognized by acquaintance and fellow [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], [[Alexander McDowell McCook]], a Union general.<ref name=harrison /> Johnson died aboard the Union hospital ship ''Hannibal'',<ref name=rose /> and the provisional government of Kentucky was left leaderless.

===Richard Hawes as governor===
[[Image:Richard-Hawes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Richard Hawes]], the second Confederate governor of Kentucky]]
Prior to abandoning Bowling Green, Governor Johnson requested that Richard Hawes come to the city and help with the administration of the government, but Hawes was delayed due to a bout with [[typhoid fever]].<ref name=rose-hawes>{{cite book |title=Kentucky's Civil War 1861 &ndash; 1865 |editor=Jerlene Rose |publisher=Back Home in Kentucky, Inc. |location=[[Clay City, Kentucky]] |year=2005 |isbn=0976923122 |chapter=Richard Hawes, 1797&ndash;1877: Our Cause is Steadily on the Increase |pages=pp. 90&ndash;91}}</ref> Following Johnson's death, the provisional government elected Hawes, who was still recovering from his illness, as governor.<ref name=harrison-hawes>{{cite book |title=''Kentucky's Governors'' |editor=Lowell H. Harrison |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |location=[[Lexington, Kentucky]] |year=2004 |isbn=0813123267 |chapter=Richard Hawes |pages=pp. 85&ndash;88}}</ref> Following his recovery, Hawes joined the government in [[Corinth, Mississippi]], and took the oath of office on [[May 31]].<ref name=brown />

During the summer of 1862, word began to spread through the Army of Tennessee that Generals Bragg and [[Edmund Kirby Smith]] were planning an invasion of Kentucky.<ref name=brown /> The legislative council voted to endorse the invasion plan, and on [[August 27]], Governor Hawes was dispatched to Richmond to favorably recommend it to President Davis.<ref name=harrison /> Davis was non-committal, but Bragg and Smith proceeded, nonetheless.<ref name=harrison-hawes /> 

On [[August 30]], Smith commanded one of the most complete Confederate victories of the war against an inexperienced Union force at the [[Battle of Richmond]].<ref name=kleber-bor>{{cite book |editor=Kleber, John E. |others=Associate editors: [[Thomas D.

Meanwhile, the leaders of Kentucky's Confederate government had remained in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], awaiting Governor Hawes' return.<ref name=harrison-hawes /> They finally departed on [[September 18]],<ref name=harrison-hawes /> and caught up with Bragg and Smith in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] on [[October 2]].<ref name=rose-hawes>{{cite book |title=Kentucky's Civil War 1861 &ndash; 1865 |editor=Jerlene Rose |publisher=Back Home in Kentucky, Inc. |location=[[Clay City, Kentucky]] |year=2005 |isbn=0976923122 |chapter=Richard Hawes, 1797&ndash;1877: Our Cause is Steadily on the Increase |pages=pp. 90&ndash;91}}</ref> Bragg had been disappointed with the number of soldiers volunteering for Confederate service in Kentucky; wagon loads of weapons that had been shipped to the Commonwealth to arm the expected enlistees remained unissued.<ref name=harrison>{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Lowell H. |authorlink=Lowell H.

==Decline and dissolution==
Following the drawn [[Battle of Perryville]], the provisional government left Kentucky for the final time.<ref name=harrison-hawes /> Displaced from their home state, members of the legislative council dispersed to places where they could make a living or be supported by relatives until Governor Hawes called them into session.<ref name=brown /> Scant records show that on [[December 30]], [[1862]], Hawes summoned the council, auditor, and treasurer to his location at [[Athens, Tennessee]] for a meeting on [[January 15]], [[1863]].<ref name=brown /> Hawes himself unsuccessfully lobbied President Davis to remove Hawes' former superior, Humphrey Marshall, from command.<ref name=brown /> On [[March 4]], Hawes told Davis by letter that "our cause is steadily on the increase" and assured him that another foray into the Commonwealth would produce better results than the first had.<ref name=brown /> 

The government's financial woes also continued. Hawes was embarrassed to admit that neither he nor anyone else seemed to know what became of approximately $45,000 that had been sent from [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]] to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] during the Confederate occupation of Kentucky.<ref name=brown /> Another major blow was Davis' 1864 decision not to allow Hawes to spend $1 million that had been secretly appropriated in August of 1861 to help Kentucky maintain its neutrality.<ref name=harrison-hawes /> Davis reasoned that the money could not be spent for its intended purpose, since Kentucky had already been admitted to the Confederacy.<ref name=harrison-hawes />

Late in the war, the provisional government existed mostly on paper. However, in the summer of 1864, Colonel R. A. Alston of the Ninth Tennessee Cavalry requested Governor Hawes' assistance in investigating crimes allegedly committed by Brigadier General [[John Hunt Morgan]] during his latest raid into Kentucky. Hawes never had to act on the request, however, as Morgan was suspended from command on [[August 10]] and killed by Union troops on [[September 4]], [[1864]].<ref name=rose-hawes />

There is no documentation detailing exactly when Kentucky's provisional government ceased operation. It is assumed to have dissolved upon the conclusion of the Civil War.<ref name=rose-hawes />
