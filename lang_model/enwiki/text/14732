The '''''Ballade des dames du temps jadis''''' ("Ballad of the Ladies of Times Past") is a poem by [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Villon]] which celebrates famous women in history and mythology, and a prominent example of the ''"[[Ubi Sunt]] ?"'' genre.  It forms part of his larger work, the ''Grand Testament''.

The section is simply labelled ''Ballade'' by Villon; the title ''des dames du temps jadis'' was added by [[Cl<U+00E9>ment Marot]] in his 1533 edition of Villon's poems.

==Translations and adaptations==
Particularly famous is its interrogative refrain, ''Mais o<U+00F9> sont les neiges d'antan?''  This was translated into English by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]] as "Where are the snows of yesteryear?", for which he coined the new word ''[[wikt:yesteryear|yesteryear]]'' to translate Villon's ''[[wikt:antan|antan]]''.  The French word was used in its original sense of "last year", although both ''antan'' and the English ''yesteryear'' have now taken on a wider meaning of "years gone by".

The refrain is taken up in the bitter and ironic [[Berthold Brecht]]/[[Kurt Weill]] "Nannas Lied",<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY-QMUp8x1s Nanna's Lied, sung by Tiziana Sojat]</ref> expressing the short-term memory without regrets of a hard-bitten prostitute, in the refrain
<blockquote>''Wo sind die Tr<U+00E4>nen von gestern abend?<br>
''Wo ist der Schnee vom vergangenen Jahr?''</blockquote>
<blockquote>Where are the tears of yesterday evening?<br/>
Where is the snow of yesteryear?</blockquote>  

The ballad has been made into a song (using the original [[Middle French]] text) by French songwriter [[Georges Brassens]], and by the Czech composer [[Petr Eben]], in the cycle ''Sestero piesn<U+00ED> milostnych'' (1951).

==In popular culture==
* The poem was alluded to in [[Joseph Heller]]'s novel, ''[[Catch-22]]'', when Yossarian asks "Where are the Snowdens of yesteryear?" in both French and English
* The text "Ou sont les neiges" is used as a screen projection in the first scene of Tennessee Williams's play "The Glass Menagerie."
* "And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth" is used by Lt. Archie Hicox in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s film ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' to describe the intended effects of a plot to assassinate the Nazi leadership.
* The poem appears in season two, episode three of ''[[Mad Men]]'' - the character Don sits in an almost empty cinema, watching a French film (identity unknown) in which a female narrator reads the poem over a series of stills.
* In chapter five of D.H. Lawrence's book 'Lady Chatterly's Lover' Clifford Chatterly asks "Where are the snows of yesteryear?...It's what endures through one's life that matters". Here he is referring to the short-lived sexual affairs that his wife, Lady Chatterly, has had with other men. He is suggesting that these affairs, like the snows of yesteryear, are ephemeral and once gone leave nothing tangible behind.
*In Act Two, scene II of the play "Blithe Spirit" by Noel Coward, Madame Arcati quotes the line, "''O<U+00F9> sont les neiges d'antan''?" as she waxes nostalgic about the good old days of "genuine religious belief" when "a drop of holy water could send even a poltergeist scampering for cover."
* In the graphical novel The Crow by James  O'Barr the quote "ou' sont les neiges d'antan" appears in the second chapter.
* The phrase "Where are the snows of yesteryear?" is included in Act II of the Broadway musical, "I Do! I Do!," in a song entitled "Where Are the Snows?" It is a duet sung by the leading characters, Michael and Agnes. (Book and Lyrics by Tom Jones. Music by Harvey Schmidt. Copyright 1966, 1968)
* In  chapter 13 of Jack Kerouac's The Dharma Bums, the quote "o<U+00F9> sont les neiges d'antan?" is referenced by Alvah.
* During the Season 2 Christmas special of [[Downton Abbey]], the Dowager Countess ([[Maggie Smith]]) quotes "O<U+00F9> sont les neiges d'antan" while reminiscing with her son about old acquaintances
