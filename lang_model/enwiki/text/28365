'''''The Marathon Family''''' ({{lang-sr|'''''Maratonci tr<U+010D>e po<U+010D>asni krug'''''}}, lit. ''The Marathoners Run the Lap of Honour'', or often simply '''''Maratonci''''') is a 1982 comedy film written by [[Du<U+0161>an Kova<U+010D>evi<U+0107>]] and directed by [[Serbia]]n director [[Slobodan <U+0160>ijan]]. It has a cult film status in Serbia as well as other countries from the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] region, and is regarded as one of the classics of Serbian cinematography.

==Plot==
The story takes place in an unnamed small Serbian town in 1935, and focuses on the Topalovi<U+0107> family consisting of six generations of [[undertaker]]s: gravely ill Pantelija, wheelchair-bound Maksimilijan who's also mute and nearly deaf, rheumatic Aksentije, sober-minded Milutin, impulsive and narcissistic Laki, and young and naive Mirko. Constantly bickering amongst each other, the latest family arguments arise from the youngest son, Mirko, not wanting to continue the family business of coffin-making. Deeply in love with a local girl Kristina, the daughter of a local hoodlum Bili Piton, he's looking to avoid the career path of his father, grandfather, great grandfather, etc. 

Though operating out of a prominently located shop in the town, Topalovi<U+0107>s' business is mostly based on illegal activities. Instead of making brand new coffins, they simply recycle already used ones with the help of Bili Piton, whose men dig them out from the local cemetery during the night. Once they get their hands on the coffins that had been dug up, Topalovi<U+0107>s simply refurbish them and sell them as new, thereby making a large profit with very little [[overhead cost|overhead]]. Based on mutual financial interest, the business relationship between Topalovi<U+0107>s and Bili is deteriorating by the day as they owe him a large sum of money for the past services rendered and show no intention of paying him.

In parallel, Topalovi<U+0107>s are in the finishing stages of building a modern [[crematory]] on which they're placing high hopes as the future source of income.

One day, the oldest Topalovi<U+0107>, Pantelija, dies and leaves family inheritance to himself because he does not trust his successors. Topalovi<U+0107>s leave business with Bili Piton and he threatens to report them to the police for killing a man in a car accident. Bili's daughter, Mirko's love Kristina wishes to become an actress in (mostly pornographic) movies made by Mirko's best friend <U+0110>enka. However, she cheats on Mirko with <U+0110>enka, so outraged Mirko kills her when he finds out. He returns to his family and makes himself their leader by force, while <U+0110>enka is accidentally burned alive by the deaf Maksimilijan, while repairing the crematorium. The movie ends with a showdown between the Topalovi<U+0107>s and Bili Piton, in which Bili Piton is killed, and then a chase between Topalovi<U+0107>s and the police, with a scene abruptly cut just as raging Mirko attempts to run over a police officer fallen from a bicycle.

==Awards==
The Marathon Family won two awards in 1982, including the Jury Prize at the [[Montr<U+00E9>al World Film Festival]] and the "Best Actress" award at the [[Pula Film Festival]], which went to [[Seka Sabli<U+0107>]] for her portrayal of Kristina.
