The '''history of water fluoridation''' can be divided into three periods. The first ({{circa}} 1901<U+2013>33) was research into the cause of a form of mottled [[tooth enamel]] called "Colorado brown stain", which later became known as fluorosis. The second (c. 1933<U+2013>45) focused on the relationship between fluoride concentrations, fluorosis, and tooth decay. The third period, from 1945 on, focused on [[water fluoridation]], which added fluoride to community water supplies.<ref name=Ripa>{{cite journal |author= Ripa LW |title= A half-century of community water fluoridation in the United States: review and commentary |journal= J Public Health Dent |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=17<U+2013>44 |year=1993 |pmid=8474047 |url=http://aaphd.org/docs/position%20papers/A%20Half-Century%20of%20Community%20Water1993.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-01-01}}</ref>

While the use of fluorides for prevention of [[dental caries]] (cavities) was discussed in the 19th century in [[Europe]],<ref>Meiers, Peter: [http://www.fluoride-history.de/fteeth1.htm "Early Fluoride research in Europe"] from the [http://www.fluoride-history.de Fluoride History] website, page accessed 21 May, 2006.</ref> community water fluoridation in the [[United States]] is partly due to the research of Dr. Frederick McKay, who pressed the dental community for an investigation into what was then known as "Colorado Brown Stain."<ref name="csdshistory">[http://www.cs-ds.org/history.asp#fluoride History of Dentistry in the Pikes Peak Region],[http://www.cs-ds.org/index.asp Colorado Springs Dental Society] webpage, page accessed 25 February, 2006.</ref> The condition, now known as [[dental fluorosis]], when in its severe form is characterized by cracking and pitting of the teeth.<ref>[http://www.nidr.nih.gov/dev/deleted_files/flouride.htm]</ref><ref>[http://www.accessscience.com/studycenter.aspx?main=7&questionID=4858 McGraw-Hill's AccessScience<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5295412 Report Judges Allowable Fluoride Levels in Water : NPR<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Of 2,945 children examined in 1909 by Dr. McKay, 87.5% had some degree of stain or mottling.  All the affected children were from the [[Pikes Peak]] region.  Despite the negative impact on the physical appearance of their teeth, the children with stained, mottled and pitted teeth also had fewer cavities than other children.  McKay brought this to the attention of [[Greene Vardiman Black|Dr. G.V. Black]], and Black's interest was followed by greater interest within the dental profession.

Initial hypotheses for the staining included poor [[nutrition]], overconsumption of [[pork]] or [[milk]], [[radium]] exposure, [[List of childhood diseases|childhood disease]]s, or a [[calcium]] deficiency in the local drinking water.<ref name="csdshistory" /> In 1931, researchers from the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) concluded that the cause of the [[Colorado]] stain was a high concentration of fluoride ions in the region's drinking water (ranging from 2 to 13.7 mg/L) and areas with lower concentrations had no staining (1 mg/L or less).<ref>Meiers, Peter: [http://www.fluoride-history.de/bauxite.htm "The Bauxite Story - A look at ALCOA"], from the [http://www.fluoride-history.de Fluoride History] website, page accessed 12 May, 2006.</ref> Pikes Peak's rock formations contained the [[mineral]] [[cryolite]], one of whose constituents is fluorine.  As the rain and snow fell, the resulting runoff water dissolved fluoride which made its way into the water supply.

[[Dental]] and aluminum [[researchers]] then moved toward determining a relatively safe level of [[fluoride]] chemicals to be added to water supplies. The research had two goals: (1) to warn communities with a high concentration of fluoride of the danger, initiating a reduction of the fluoride levels in order to reduce incidences of [[fluorosis]], and (2) to encourage communities with a low concentration of fluoride in drinking water to add [[fluoride]] chemicals in order to help prevent [[tooth decay]]. By 2006, 69.2% of the U.S. population on public water systems were receiving fluoridated water, amounting to 61.5% of the total [[U.S.]] population; 3.0% of the population on public water systems were receiving naturally occuring fluoride.<ref name=US-WF-Stats-2006>{{cite web |author= Division of Oral Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC |title= Water fluoridation statistics for 2006 |url=http://cdc.gov/fluoridation/statistics/2006stats.htm |date=2008-09-17 |accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref>

A study of varying amounts of fluoride in water was led by Dr. [[H. Trendley Dean]], a dental officer of the [[U.S. Public Health Service]].<ref>Dean, H.T. "Classification of mottled enamel diagnosis." ''Journal of the American Dental Association'', 21, 1421 - 1426, 1934.</ref><ref>Dean, H.T. "Chronic endemic dental fluorosis." ''Journal of the American Dental Association'', 16, 1269 - 1273, 1936.</ref> In 1936 and 1937, Dr. Dean and other dentists compared statistics from [[Amarillo]], which had 2.8 - 3.9 mg/L fluoride content, and low fluoride [[Wichita Falls]].  The data is alleged to show less cavities in Amarillo children, but the studies were never published.<ref name=autogenerated7>[http://www.fluoride-history.de/bartlett.htm Questionable Fluoride Safety Studies: Bartlett - Cameron, Newburgh - Kingston<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Dr. Dean's research on the fluoride-dental caries relationship, published in 1942, included 7,000 children from 21 cities in [[Colorado]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], and [[Ohio]].  The study concluded that the optimal amount of fluoride which minimized the risk of severe fluorosis but had positive benefits for tooth decay was 1&nbsp;mg per day, per adult.  Although fluoride is more abundant in the environment today, this was estimated to [[correlate]] with the concentration of 1 mg/L.

In 1937, dentists Henry Klein and Carroll E. Palmer had considered the possibility of fluoridation to prevent cavities after their evaluation of data gathered by a Public Health Service team at dental examinations of Native American children.<ref>Klein H., Palmer C.E.: "Dental caries in American Indian children", Public Health Bulletin, No. 239, Dec. 1937</ref> In a series of papers published afterwards (1937-1941), yet disregarded by his colleagues within the U.S.P.H.S., Klein summarized his findings on tooth development in children and related problems in epidemiological investigations on caries prevalence.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

In 1939, Dr. Gerald J. Cox<ref>Meiers, Peter: [http://www.fluoride-history.de/cox.htm  "Gerald Judy Cox"].</ref> conducted laboratory tests using [[rats]] that were fed [[aluminum]] and fluoride. Dr. Cox suggested adding fluoride to drinking water (or other media such as [[milk]] or bottled water) in order to improve oral health.<ref>Cox, G.J., M.C. Matuschak, S.F. Dixon, M.L. Dodds, W.E. Walker.  "Experimental dental caries IV. Fluorine and its relation to dental caries.  Journal of Dental Research, 18, 481-490, 1939.  Copy of original paper can be found [http://jdr.iadrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/18/6/481 here].</ref> 

In the mid 1940s, four widely cited studies were conducted.  The researchers investigated cities that had both fluoridated and unfluoridated water.  The first pair was [[Muskegon, Michigan]] and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], making Grand Rapids the first community in the world to add fluoride chemicals to its drinking water to try to benefit dental health on [[January 25]], [[1945]].<ref name="mntmichigan">[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=27595 After 60 Years of Success, Water Fluoridation Still Lacking in Many Communities].

In 1952 Nebraska Representative A.L. Miller complained that there had been no studies carried out to assess the potential adverse health risk to [[senior citizens]], [[pregnant women]] or people with [[chronic diseases]] from exposure to the fluoridation chemicals.<ref name=autogenerated7 /> A decrease in the incidence of tooth decay was found in some of the cities which had added fluoride chemicals to water supplies. The early comparison studies would later be criticized as, "primitive," with a, "virtual absence of quantitative, statistical methods...nonrandom method of selecting data and...high sensitivity of the results to the way in which the study populations were grouped..." in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]].<ref> Diesendorf, Mark '' The mystery of declining tooth decay'' Nature, July 10, 1986</ref>
