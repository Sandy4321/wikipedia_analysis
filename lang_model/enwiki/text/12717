'''Moonbootica''' is the pseudonym of Hamburg DJs [[KoweSix]] und [[Tobi Tobsen|Tobitob]] (the latter a former member of [[F<U+00FC>nf Sterne deluxe]]). The band name derives from their rather large shoe sizes{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} (12.5 and 13.5 US) which quickly lead to the fitting shoes, [[moon boot]]s. Their musical style is [[House music|House]] (a combination of Electro House and Frunky House/French House) with little [[Hip Hop]] influences. Together they launched the label ''Moonbootique'', under which they also publish their own creations.
