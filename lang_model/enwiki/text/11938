'''Anna Flyover''' (also known as '''Gemini Flyover'''), lies in the heart of [[Chennai]]. It was constructed to ease traffic movement on Mount Road - now renamed Anna Salai - near Nungambakkam High road. It essentially allows traffic flowing directly on Anna Salai to continue unhindered by the cross traffic.

It was built on the land originally housing The Gemini Studios (a contemporary of A.V.M) along with a chunk of property from the Woodlands Drive-In Restaurant.  On two sides of the circle roundabout below the center of the flyover are two identical statues of a man controlling a horse placed there to commemmorate the banning of [[horse racing]].

It is an extremely well-known landmark in [[Chennai]] as almost anyone in the city will know where it is.
