'''Atlantis''' is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] ''[[Lucha libre|Luchador]] [[wrestling mask|Enmascarado]]'' (Masked [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]) currently working for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) where he performs as a ''Rudo'' ([[Heel (professional wrestling)|Heel]] or "bad guy" character) as part of the group ''[[Los Guerreros del Infierno|Los Guerreros de Atlantida]]'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "the Warriors of Atlantis") along with [[<U+00DA>ltimo Guerrero]] and [[Rey Bucanero]]. Atlantis has held a large number of professional wrestling championships over the years, both in Mexico and in [[Japan]]. Atlantis was trained by [[Diablo Velasco]], made his in-ring debut in 1983 and has always wrestled under the [[ring name]] Atlantis, named after the sunken city of [[Atlantis]]. Despite having worked as a ''Rudo'' for several years Atlantis is still very popular with young kids, retaining the nickname ''El idolo de los Ni<U+00F1>os'' (The idol of the children) after turning ''Rudo''. Atlantis' real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans.<ref name=Mondo>{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha a Go Go: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = Okay... what is Lucha Libre? | pages = 29&ndash;40 | accessdate= October 17, 2009 | id=ISBN 978-0-06-085583-3}}</ref>

==Professional wrestling career==
Atlantis made his professional wrestling debut on June 12, 1983 after training under world renowned Mexican wrestling trainer [[Diablo Velazco]] for just under a year.<ref name=FigurasAtlantis/> He adopted the masked [[ring name|ring persona]] of "Atlantis", a supposed warrior from the lost city of [[Atlantis]], complete with a mask that had the image of two fish on it.<ref name=FigurasAtlantis/> After working for various Mexican promotions for the first year of his career Atlantis became a regular for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|Empressa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]] (EMLL), Mexico's oldest [[professional wrestling promotion]]. On November 30, 1984 Atlantis defeated [[Jerry Estrada]] to win the [[Mexican National Middleweight Championship]], the first wrestling title of his career.<ref name=MexMiddle/> Atlantis held the Middleweight title for 457 days, with several high profile title defenses that helped establish the young wrestler's reputation for good matches.<ref name=Lucha2000>{{cite news | author = Lucha 2000 Staff | title = Los Reyes de Mexico: La Historia de Los Campeonatos Nacionales | work =Lucha 2000 | id = Especial 21 | date = December 20, 2004 | accessdate = December 15, 2009 | language = Spanish}}</ref> On March 2, 1986 Atlantis lost the Middleweight title to [[Arturo Beristain|Talism<U+00E1>n]].<ref name=MexMiddle/> By 1988 Atlantis had formed a regular [[tag team]] with [[<U+00C1>ngel Azteca]] and on March 6, 1988 the duo defeated [[Los Infernales]] ([[Masakre]] and [[MS-1 (wrestler)|MS-1]] to win the [[Mexican National Tag Team Championship]].<ref name=MexTag/> Three months later Atlantis became a double champion when he defeated [[Kung Fu (wrestler)|Kung Fu]] to win the [[NWA World Middleweight Championship]], the highest championship in the [[Lucha Libre#Weight classes|middleweight division]].<ref name=NWAMiddle/> Atlantis only held the title for 37 days before losing the title to [[Emilio Charles, Jr.]] in his first title defense.<ref name=NWAMiddle/> He quickly regained the title, defeating Charles, Jr. on July 20, 1988 and held it for 2 weeks before losing the title back to Emilio Charles, Jr.<ref name=NWAMiddle/> On May 25, 1990, after a 811 day title reign, Atlantis and <U+00C1>ngel Azteca lost the Mexican Nation Tag Team Title to [[Pierroth Jr.]] and [[Bestia Salvaje]].<ref name=MexTag/> The loss of the Tag Team titles was used as a [[Narrative thread|storyline]] motivation for <U+00C1>ngel Azteca turning ''Rudo'' (villain or [[Heel (professional wrestling)|Heel]] by attacking Atlantis. The feud between the two continued off and on over the years until <U+00C1>ngel Azteca's death in 2007. The two fought in several intense and bloody battles, but two remained close friends backstage.<ref name=MundoHispano>{{cite web | url=http://www.munhispano.com/?nid=247&sid=1008433 | title= Reportan s<U+00FA>bita muerte del luchador Angel Azteca en Campeche | date= March 19, 2007 | accessdate= August 11, 2009 | publisher= Mundo Hispano de KSL | language=Spanish}}</ref>

The feud with <U+00C1>ngel Azteca, coupled with a third run with the NWA World Middleweight title made Atlantis one of the rising stars in EMLL, and he was one of the key figures in the "rebranding" of the company to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) in 1990. In 1991 Atlantis starred in a movie called ''La Fuerza Bruta'' ("The Brute Power") and soon after began filming another movie where he teamed up with [[Octag<U+00F3>n]] called ''Octag<U+00F3>n y Atlantis, la revancha'' ("Octag<U+00F3>n and Atlantis, the revenge") that opened in 1992. On April 4, 1991 Atlantis, Octag<U+00F3>n and [[M<U+00E1>scara Sagrada]], a team nicknamed "Los Movie Stars" defeated ''Los Thundercats'' (Leono, Panthro and Tigro, a team of masked wrestlers patterned on the [[Thundercats]] cartoon) to win the [[Mexican National Trios Championship]]. The trio held the title for 94 days before losing it to [[Capos (professional wrestling)|Los Hermanos Dinamita]] ([[Cien Caras]], [[M<U+00E1>scara A<U+00F1>o 2000]] and [[Universo 2000]]) on August 11, 1991.<ref name=MexTrio/> Not long after the title loss Octag<U+00F3>n and M<U+00E1>scara Sagrada left CMLL for the recently formed [[Asistencia Asesor<U+00ED>a y Administraci<U+00F3>n]] (AAA) promotion, jumping ship before the "Atlantis y Octag<U+00F3>n" movie opened in the theaters. Atlantis was also offered a contract by AAA but decided to stay with the company he had worked for almost his entire career.<ref name=FigurasAtlantis/> On March 3, 1993 Atlantis lost the NWA World Middleweight title to [[Mano Negra (wrestler)|Mano Negra]], as part of a long running storyline between the two. While Mano Negra won the championship, Atlantis gained the ultimate measure of revenge as he unmasked Mano Negro after defeating him in a ''[[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Luchas de Apuesta]]'' (bet match) as the main event of CMLL's 60th Anniversary Show.<ref name=Ovaciones20999/> On March 2, 1994 Atlantis defeated [[Dr. Wagner, Jr.]] to win the [[CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship]], officially moving from the Middleweight to the [[Lucha Libre#Weight classes|Light Heavyweight division]], a title he would hold for 655 days.<ref name=CMLLLHeavy/> In 1995 Atlantis brother made his wrestling debut as ''Atlantico'' and the two teamed up on a regular basis, including second annual ''[[CMLL Torneo Gran Alternativa#Gran Alternativa 1995|Gran Alternativa]]'' tournament, losing to Dr. Wagner, Jr. and [[Mephisto (wrestler)|Astro Rey, Jr.]] in the second round.<ref name=PWGA1995>{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/emll/grand.html#2 | title= CMLL Gran Alternativa #2 | dat= April 7, 1995 | accessdate= September 3, 2009 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref> On November 3, 1995 Atlantis teamed with [[Rayo de Jalisco, Jr.]] to win the [[CMLL World Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Headhunters (professional wrestling)|The Headhunters]].<ref name=CMLLTag1and2/> The team lost the tag team title in August, 1996 but Atlantis and new partner [[Lizmark]] won the titles back from ''La Ola Blanca'' (Spanish for "the White Wave"; [[Gran Markus, Jr.]] and [[Arturo Beristain|El Hijo del Gladiador]]).<ref name=CMLLTag1and2/> Atlantis and Lizmark only held the title for 12 days before the titles were vacated following an inconslusive match with the Headhunters.<ref name=CMLLTag1and2/> Despite only holding the tag team title for 12 days Atlantis and Lizmark continued to team up, joined by [[Mr. Niebla]] in 1997 to form ''La Ola Azur'' ("The Blue Wave" a reference to the fact that all three wrestlers mainly wore blue). ''La Ola Azur'' won the [[CMLL World Trios Championship]] from [[Rey Bucanero]], Emilio Charles, Jr. and [[El Sat<U+00E1>nico]].<ref name=CMLLTrios1/> ''La Ola Azur'' defended the title for over 500 days until October, 1998 where an injury to Mr. Niebla forced the team to give up the title.<ref name=CMLLTrios1/> On May 10, 1990 Atlantis defeated Dr. Wagner, Jr. to become only the second man to ever hold the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship two times.<ref name=CMLLLHeavy/> Over the next 196 days Atlantis' CMLL World Light Heavyweight title defenses headlined several shows in Mexico City before he lost the title to [[Villa<U+00F1>o III]] on November 22, 1999. The title change was just one of the highlights of a long running feud between Atlantis and Villa<U+00F1>o III, a feud that also included III's younger brothers [[Villa<U+00F1>o IV]] and [[Villa<U+00F1>o V]]. On March 17, 2000, at CMLL's ''[[Jucio Final (2000)|Jucio Final]]'' event, Atlantis won his biggest ''Apuesta'' victory to date as he defeated and then unmasked Villa<U+00F1>o III in a match that was voted the [[Wrestling Observer]] 2000 [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Match of the Year|Match of the Year]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Luchas 2000 staff | title = Luchas 2000 | work = Atlantis y sus Victimas | publisher = Publicaciones citem, S.A. de C.V. | location = [[Ciudad Ju<U+00E1>rez|Ju<U+00E1>rez]], [[Mexico]] | id = Especial 30 | pages = 32 <U+2013> 36 | date = | accessdate = March 22, 2009 | language = Spanish}}</ref> On June 16, 2002 Atlantis, Mr. Niebla and [[Black Warrior (wrestler)|Black Warrior]] defeated [[Blue Panther]], [[Fuerza Guerrera]] and Dr. Wagner, Jr. to win the CMLL World Trios title, a title the team would hold for 278 days straight.<ref name=CMLLTrios2/> In 2003 Atlantis travelled to Japan, working for [[Michinoku Pro]] where he won the [[Tohoku Junior Heavyweight Championship]] from [[Dick Togo]] on August 26, 2003.<ref name=Tohoku/> Atlantis' tour of Michinoku Pro was so well received that he was allowed to retain the title when travelling back to Mexico and has been invited on annual tours with the promotion every year since the. On March 28, 2004 Atlantis lost the Michinoku Pro title to [[The Great Sasuke]], returning the belt to Japan.<ref name=Tohoku/> On June 25, 2004 Atlantis teamed up with Blue Panther to defeat ''[[Los Guerreros del Infierno]]'' ("The Infernal Warriors"; [[<U+00DA>ltimo Guerrero]] and Rey Bucanero]]) to win the CMLL World Tag Team Title. Their title reign lasted 280 days, until Atlantis turned on his partner during a match and cost them the titles. The fact that the career ''tecnico'' ([[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] or "good guy" character) turned ''rudo'' for the first time helped revitalize a career that was stagnating.<ref name=FigurasAtlantis/>
