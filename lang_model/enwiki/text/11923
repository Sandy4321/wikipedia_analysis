The '''FIFA World Cup''', sometimes called the '''football World Cup''' or the '''soccer World Cup''', but usually referred to simply as the '''World Cup''', is an international [[football (soccer)|football]] competition contested by the [[list of national football teams|men's national football teams]] of member nations of the F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association ([[FIFA]]) (the sport's global governing body). The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]], except in 1942 and 1946, due to [[World War II]]. However, the event is often ongoing, as the qualifying rounds of the competition take place over the three years preceding the final rounds. Since 1991, FIFA has also held the [[FIFA Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] on a similar four-year schedule.

The tournament's final phase (often called the "World Cup Finals") involves thirty-two national teams competing at several venues (within the host nation or nations) over a period of about a month. It is the most widely-viewed sporting event in the world, with 1.1 billion people watching the [[2002 FIFA World Cup#Final|2002 tournament final]].<ref name="2002coverage">[http://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/newmedia/index/0,3509,10,00.html 2002 FIFA World Cup TV Coverage], FIFA official website. Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref>

In eighteen tournaments held, only seven nations have won. [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] is the most successful World Cup team, having won the tournament five times. The current Cup holder, [[Italy national football team|Italy]], follows with four titles, while [[Germany national football team|Germany]] holds three. The other former champions are [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] with two titles each, and [[England national football team|England]] and [[France national football team|France]] with one title each. Of the ten World Cups staged in Europe, only one saw victory by a non-[[UEFA|Europe]]an team, that being Brazil in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]]. When held outside Europe, the competition has only been won by [[CONMEBOL|South America]]n teams. Only two teams from outside these two continents have ever reached the semi-finals of the competition: the [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]] (in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]]) and [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea]] (in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]).

The [[2006 FIFA World Cup|most recent football World Cup Finals]] were held between [[June 9]] and [[July 9]], 2006 in Germany, where [[Italy national football team|Italy]] were crowned champions after beating France 1-1 (5-3) in a penalty shoot-out.

==History==
{{main|History of the FIFA World Cup}}

===Previous international competitions=== 
The first international football match was played in [[1872 in sports|1872]] between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]]. <ref>[http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1872-00/1872-73/M0001Sco1872.html England National Football Team Match No. 1]</ref>  At this stage the sport was rarely played outside [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. As football began to increase in popularity, it was held as a [[demonstration sport]] (with no medals awarded) at the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]] and [[1904 Summer Olympics]], and at the [[1906 Intercalated Games]]; football became an official competition at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]]. Planned by [[The Football Association]], the event was for [[amateurism|amateur]] players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great Britain (represented by the [[England national amateur football team]]) won the event in both 1908 and [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912]].

In 1906, there was an attempt made by [[FIFA]] to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside of the Olympic framework in Switzerland. These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been a failure.<ref name="FIFAhistory">[http://www.fifa.com/en/history/history/0,1283,4,00.html Where it all began] FIFA official website. Retrieved on [[April 10]] [[2006]].</ref>

With the Olympic event continuing to be contested only between amateur teams, Sir [[Thomas Lipton]] produced the [[Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy]] tournament in [[Turin]] in 1909. The Lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs (not national teams) from different nations, each one of which represented an entire nation. For this reason, it was not really a forerunner of the World Cup. Notwithstanding, the competition is sometimes described as ''The First World Cup'',<ref>[http://www.shrewsbury.gov.uk/Public/news/thomaslipton.htm 'The First World Cup'. The Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy]. Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council. Retrieved on [[April 11]][[2006]].</ref> and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]]. The first tournament was won by [[West Auckland Town F.C.|West Auckland]], an [[England|English]] amateur side from [[County Durham]], that was invited after the Football Association refused to be associated with the competition. West Auckland returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title, and were given the trophy to keep forever, as per the rules of the competition. 

In 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the Olympic tournament as a "world football championship for amateurs",<ref name="FIFAhistory" /> and took responsibility for managing the event. This paved the way for the world's [[Football at the 1920 Summer Olympics|first intercontinental football competition]], at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]], contested by [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] (who were [[Knockout tournament|knocked out]] in their first match) and thirteen European teams. The golden medals were won by [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tableso/ol1920f-det.html VII. Olympiad Antwerp 1920 Football Tournament] [[rec.sport.soccer Statistics Foundation]]. Retrieved on [[June 10]] [[2006]].</ref> [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] won the tournaments in [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924]] and [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]]. In 1928 FIFA made the decision to stage their own international tournament. With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions (as 1924 was the start of FIFA's professional era) and to celebrate their [[centenary]] of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country.

===First World Cup===
[[Image:Estadiocentenario.JPG|thumb|The [[Estadio Centenario]], the location of the first World Cup final in 1930 in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]]]]

The [[1932 Summer Olympics]], held in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], did not plan to include football as part of the schedule due to the low popularity of [[Soccer in the United States|football in the United States]], as [[American football]] had been growing in popularity. FIFA and the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] also disagreed over the status of amateur players, and so football was dropped from the Games.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A565148 The Football World Cup - An Introduction], [[h2g2]]. Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref> FIFA president [[Jules Rimet]] thus planned the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|inaugural World Cup tournament]] to be held in [[Uruguay]] in 1930. The national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] for European sides. Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition.<ref>[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/pwc/1930.html Uruguay 1930] FIFA World Cup site. Retrieved on [[January 9]] [[2006]].</ref> Rimet eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia to make the trip. In total 13 nations took part <U+2014> seven from [[South America]], four from [[Europe]] and two from [[North America]]. 

The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by [[France national football team|France]] and the [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]], who beat [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 4-1 and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] 3-0, respectively. The first goal in World Cup history was scored by [[Lucien Laurent]] of France. In the final, [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] defeated [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] 4-2 in front of a crowd of 93,000 people in [[Montevideo]], and became the first nation to win a World Cup.<ref name="origin">[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/releases/en/fwc_origin_en.pdf FIFA World Cup Origin], FIFA Media Release. Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref>

===Growth===
The issues facing the early World Cup tournaments were the difficulties of intercontinental travel, and war. Few South American teams were willing to travel to Europe for the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] and [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]] tournaments, with Brazil the only South American team to compete in both. The 1942 and 1946 competitions were cancelled due to [[World War II]] and its aftermath.

The [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] was the first to include British participants. British teams withdrew from FIFA in 1920, partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with, and partly as a protest against a foreign influence to football,<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0001/index.shtml Scotland and the 1950 World Cup], BBC. Retrieved on [[May 13]] [[2006]].</ref> but rejoined in 1946 following FIFA's invitation. The tournament also saw the return of 1930 champions Uruguay, who had boycotted the previous two World Cups. Uruguay won the tournament again.

In the tournaments between [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] and [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]], 16 teams qualified for each finals tournament, except in 1938 and 1950 where teams withdrew after qualifying. Most were from Europe and Latin America, with a very small minority from [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. These teams were usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams (with the notable exception of [[North Korea national football team|North Korea]], who reached the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]] quarter-finals).

The finals were expanded to 24 teams in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], then 32 in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part. In recent years, these comparatively new participants have enjoyed more success, including [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]], reaching the knockout rounds in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]]; [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], quarter-finalists in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]]; [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]], reaching the knockout rounds in [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]; [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], reaching the knockout rounds in both 1994 and [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]]; [[Japan national football team|Japan]] reaching the knockout rounds; [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]], quarter-finalists in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]];  [[United States national football team|United States]], also quarter-finalists in 2002; [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]], semi-finalists in 2002, and [[Australia national football team|Australia]] and [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], both reaching the knockout rounds in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]].

198 nations attempted to qualify for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], and all but three of the 207 FIFA member nations have previously entered the competition, with [[Comoros national football team|Comoros]], [[East Timor national football team|East Timor]]  and [[Bhutan national football team|Bhutan]] the only current members not yet to have entered (Comoros and East Timor were not FIFA members at the time of the qualifying draw for the 2006 tournament, and so have not yet had an opportunity to take part).<ref>[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/t/team/profile.html?team=bhu Bhutan - team profile], FIFA World Cup site. Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref> 

An equivalent tournament for [[women's football (soccer)|women's football]], the [[FIFA Women's World Cup]], was first held in [[FIFA Women's World Cup 1991|1991]] in [[China]].

==Trophy==
:{{main|FIFA World Cup Trophy}}
[[Image:Wohlfahrtsbriefmarke-fifa.jpg|right|thumb|[[Football World Cup Trophy|FIFA World Cup Trophy]] on a German [[Postage stamp|stamp]]]]
From 1930 to 1970, the [[Jules Rimet Trophy]] was awarded to the Cup winner. It was originally simply known as the ''World Cup'' or ''Coupe du Monde'', but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president who set up the first tournament. In [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]], Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983, and has never been recovered.<ref>[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/h/rimet.html Jules Rimet Cup], FIFA World Cup site. Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref>

After 1970, a new trophy, known as the FIFA World Cup Trophy, was designed. This is not awarded to the winning nation permanently, irrespective of how many World Cups they win. Argentina, Germany (as West Germany), Italy and Brazil have all won the second trophy twice. It will not be retired until the name plaque has been entirely filled with the names of winning nations in 2038.

The experts of the FIFA, coming from seven different countries, valued the 53 presented models, finally oping for the work of the italian Silvio Gazzaniga. The new trophy is 36 cm high, made of solid (fully gold) 18-[[carat]] gold and weighs 10.97 kilogrammes. The base contains two layers of semi-precious [[malachite]] while the bottom side of the Trophy bears the engraved year and name of each FIFA World Cup winner since 1974. The description of the artist was: "The lines rise from the base, raise bundling up itself in spiral and bloom to contain the world. From the amazing dynamic tension of the compact sculpture body, two athlete figure are delineated, represented in the exaltation of the victory."

World Cup winners retain it until the next tournament and are awarded a gold-plated replica rather than the solid gold original.

===Qualification===  	 
{{main|FIFA World Cup qualification}} 	 
Since the second World Cup in [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]], qualifying tournaments have been held to thin the field for the final tournament. They are held within the six FIFA continental zones (Africa, Asia, North and Central America and Caribbean, South America, Oceania, Europe), overseen by their respective confederations. For each tournament, FIFA decides the number of places awarded to each of the continental zones beforehand, generally based on the relative strength of the confederations' teams, but also subject to lobbying from the confederations. 	 
			
The qualification process can start as early as almost three years before the final tournament and last over a two-year period. The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations. Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental [[play-off]]s. For example, the winner of the Oceanian zone and the fifth-placed team from the South American zone entered a play-off to decide which team would qualify for the 2006 World Cup.<ref>[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/t/match/index.html?st=zone&zone=sao&tm=all&ym=all Matches and Results], FIFA World Cup site. Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref> From the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]] onwards, host nations have received an automatic berth in the finals. This right also used to be granted to the defending champion, but from the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] finals onwards, this entitlement has been withdrawn, requiring the champions to qualify as well.<ref>[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/050901/1/4hs8.html Brazil's Juan warns against complacency], FIFA World Cup site. Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref>

===Final tournament===
The current finals tournament features 32 national teams competing over a month in the host nation(s). There are two stages: a ''group stage'' followed by a ''knockout stage''.

In the group stage, teams compete within eight groups of four teams each. Eight teams are [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seeded]] (based on both current [[FIFA World Rankings]] and recent World Cups) and assigned to separate groups. The other teams are drawn at random. Since [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], constraints have applied to the draw to ensure that no group contains more than two European teams or more than one team from any other confederation. Each group plays a [[round-robin tournament]], guaranteeing that every team will play at least three matches. The last round of matches of each group is held simultaneously to preserve fairness.

The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage.  Points are used to rank the teams within a group.  Since [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], [[Three points for a win|three points have been awarded for a win]], one for a draw and none for a loss (prior to this, winners received two points rather than three).  If two or more teams end up with the same number of points, tie-breakers are used: first is [[goal difference]], then total goals scored, then head-to-head results, and finally drawing of lots (i.e. determining team positions at random).<ref>{{cite web

The knockout stage is a single-elimination round in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with [[extra time]] and [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootouts]] used to decide the winner. It begins with the "round of 16" (or "last 16") in which the winner of each group plays against the runner-up from another group. This is followed by quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final. The losing semi-finalists contest a third-place match.

==Selection of hosts==
{{main|FIFA World Cup hosts}}
<!-- Make sure that any changes made here is also reflected upon the article [[FIFA World Cup hosts]]. -->
Early World Cups were given to countries at meetings of FIFA's congress. The choice of location was highly controversial, given the three week boat journey between [[South America]] and [[Europe]], the two centres of strength in football. The decision to hold the first cup in [[Uruguay]], for example, led to only four European nations competing.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_1632000/1632201.stm History of 1930 World Cup], BBC. Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref> The next two world cups were both held in [[Europe]]. The decision to hold the second of these, the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], in [[France]] was controversial, as the American countries had been led to understand that the World Cup would rotate between the two continents. Both [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] thus boycotted the tournament.<ref>[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/pwc/1938.html France 1938], FIFA World Cup site. Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref> 

After the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]], to avoid any future boycotts or controversy, FIFA began a pattern of alternation between [[Americas|the Americas]] and Europe, which continued until the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. The [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] (hosted jointly by [[Japan]] and [[South Korea|Korea]]) was the first one held in [[Asia]], and in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], [[South Africa]] will become the first [[Africa|African]] nation to host the World Cup.

The [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] was allocated to South America in 2003, allowing the ten member nations of [[CONMEBOL]] to bid in order to host. However, after a short period of time, every nation in the continent backed Brazil as the only viable host of the 2014 finals, creating the odd situation where the 2014 World Cup host was unofficially determined. However, it is not yet certain that Brazil will be able to host the competition; if the Brazilians pull out, there has been discussion of a proposed bid by [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]] to co-host the tournament as did Korea/Japan in 2002. [[Colombia]] is also considering a bid to host the 2014 World Cup. Otherwise, the tournament will be moved to another continent. Recently, FIFA president Sepp Blatter indicated that Brazil is "almost certain to be the hosts of the 2014 World Cup.<ref>http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=373231&cc=5739</ref>"

The system evolved so that the host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFA's executive committee. This is done under a [[single transferable vote]] system. The decision is currently made six years in advance of the tournament.

===Successful national teams===
{{Mainlist|National team appearances in the FIFA World Cup}}
[[Image:World cup countries best results and hosts.PNG|250px|thumb|Map of countries' best results]]
In all, 207 teams have competed to qualify for the World Cup Finals, and 78 nations have qualified at least once. Of these, only eleven have made it to the final match, and only seven have won. The seven national teams that have won the World Cup have added [[Star (football crest)|stars to the crest]], located on their shirt, each star representing a World Cup victory.

With five titles, Brazil is the most successful World Cup team and also the only nation to have [[National team appearances in the FIFA World Cup#Ranking of teams by number of appearances|participated in every World Cup Finals tournament]] so far. Italy follows with four titles, including the most recent one in 2006. Brazil and Italy are also the only nations to have won consecutive titles, each winning their first two titles back-to-back (Italy: 1934 and 1938; Brazil: 1958 and 1962). In 1970 and 1994, Brazil and Italy were finalists, each having a chance to become the first team to win a third title (and allowing them to keep the Jules Rimet trophy permanently) and a fourth title respectively. Brazil won both matches, and added a record fifth title in 2002.

Brazil and Germany are the only two teams ever to appear in three consecutive World Cup final matches (1994, 1998, 2002 and 1982, 1986, 1990, respectively). Brazil won two out of the three (1994, 2002), with Germany winning only one (1990; all three appearances as West Germany). Of the eighteen World Cup final matches, only twice have the same two teams contested the match. Brazil and Italy played in 1970 and 1994, and West Germany and Argentina in 1986 and 1990. Every final match has also featured one of Brazil, Italy, Germany, and Argentina.

Below is a list of teams that have finished in the top four in a World Cup. Germany lead all nations with 11 top four finishes. Brazil and Germany are tied for most appearances in the final match with seven each.

:''<nowiki>*</nowiki> = hosts''
:''<nowiki>#</nowiki> = states that have since split into several independent nations

[[Image:World cup winners.png|250px|right|thumb|Map of winning countries]]

===Performances by host nations===
Six of the seven champions have won one of their titles while playing in their own homeland, the exception being [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], who lost the deciding match (known as [[Maracanazo]]) when they hosted the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] tournament.

[[England national football team|England]] ([[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]]) and [[France national football team|France]] ([[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]]) won their only titles while playing as host nations. [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] ([[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]]), [[Italy national football team|Italy]] ([[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]]) and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] ([[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]]) won their first titles as host nations but have gone on to win again, while [[Germany national football team|Germany]] ([[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]]) won their second cup title on home soil.

Other nations have also been successful during their spell as hosts. [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] (runners-up in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]]), [[Chile national football team|Chile]] (third place in [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]]), [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] (fourth place in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]), [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] (quarterfinals in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]]) and [[Japan national football team|Japan]] (second round in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]) all have their best results when serving as hosts. In fact, all host nations have progressed at least beyond the first round. The success of the host in the Cup is a major reason why nations actively lobby to be selected as hosts, as they seek to gain the advantage of a [[12th Man (football)|supportive crowd]].

===Best performances by continental zones===
{{seealso|National team appearances in the FIFA World Cup#Performance by confederation}}

To date, the final of the World Cup has only been contested by [[UEFA|European]] and [[CONMEBOL|South American]] teams. The two continents have won nine titles apiece. Only two teams from outside these two continents have ever reached the semi-finals of the competition: the USA (in 1930) and South Korea (in 2002). African teams have had some success of late but have never reached the semi-finals. Oceania have only been represented in the World Cup three times, and only once did a Oceanian team reached the second round.

Interestingly, all World Cups won by European teams have taken place in Europe. The only non-European team to win in Europe is Brazil in 1958. Only twice had consecutive World Cups been won by teams from the same continent - when Italy and Brazil successfully defended their titles in 1938 and 1962 respectively.
