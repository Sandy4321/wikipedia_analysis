A reviewer of its modern edition even called it "the Byzantinist's ''[[Historia Augusta]]''".<ref>Barry Baldwin, in a positive review in ''Speculum'', '''61'''.2 (April 1986:388).</ref> Classicists have been frustrated in not being able securely to identify in ''Parastaseis'' the great sculptures of Antiquity that had been removed to Constantinople by [[Constantine the Great]] and his successors, and which continued to represent continuity with the classical tradition by their prominent presence in Constantinople's public spaces.

Fire and damage took their toll, but enough remained to form the subject of [[Nicetas Choniates]]'s little pamphlet ''On the Statues destroyed by the Latins'',<ref>Possible alterations by a later writer have complicated the study of this text.</ref> in which Nicetas described the destruction of the remaining statues by the [[Latins|Latin]] [[Fourth Crusade|crusaders]] at the [[siege of Constantinople (1204)|sack of Constantinople in 1204]].<ref>Cyril Mango, "Antique statuary and the Byzantine beholder", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' '''17''' (1963:55-59).</ref>

The ''Parastaseis'', dedicated to a doubtless imaginary "''Philokalos''", the generic "lover of beauty", are generally interpreted on the simplest level as a kind of tourist's guide to the curiosities of Constantinople, in the manner of the later guides to Rome, ''[[Mirabilia urbis Romae]]'' and ''[[De mirabilibus urbis Romae]]''. In Classical Greek, a description of a work of art is an ''[[ekphrasis]]'', and when considered under this rubric, or compared with the later compilation of notes on Constantinople called the ''Patria'' of Constantinople,<ref>Edited by Gilbert Dagron, ''Constantinople imaginaire: Etudes sur le receuil des "Patria"'', 1984.</ref> the ''Parastaseis'' fail to give an objective description. Instead, the reader is offered anecdotal narratives about the statues, which had become foci for [[legend]]s and wonder-working objects themselves. "Statues were perceived on both the intellectual and popular level as animated, dangerous and [[talisman]]ic," observes Liz James.<ref>James,  "'Pray Not to Fall into Temptation and Be on Your Guard': Pagan Statues in Christian Constantinople" ''Gesta'' '''35'''.1 (1996:12-20) p. 15.</ref> Few of these [[anecdote]]s were as extended as the first-person narration about a statue of "Maximian" in the theatre of the Kynegion, which fell upon the investigator's companion, killing him; the narrator, who had taken refuge in [[Hagia Sophia]], was exonerated when a certain philosopher, Johannes, found a text attributed to [[Demosthenes]], predicting that the statue was ''[[Destiny|fated]]'' to kill a prominent man. The emperor [[Philippicus]] (reigned 711<U+2013>13) then had the statue buried.<ref>Recounted by James 1996:12.</ref> Such anecdotes do not directly relate to the commonly attributed imperial motivations for displaying classical plunder, as manifestations of imperial splendor past, present and future,<ref>The [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]], studded with antique statues, is seen by S.G. Bassett as "a neatly crafted ensemble that described a vision of power in its past, present and future manifestations" (Bassett, "The antiquities of the Hippodrome of Constantinople", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' '''45''' [1991:87-96]); H. Saradi-Mendelovici, "Christian attitudes to pagan monuments in Late Antiquity and their legacy in later Byzantine centuries" ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers" '''44''' (1990:47-61</ref> and may be too summarily dismissed merely as examples of Christian superstition with regard to "[[idol]]s".
 
Liz James<ref>James 1996:12-20.</ref> reinterpreted the text as exemplifying Byzantine views of the ''[[daimon]]es'' inhabiting such three-dimensional figural representations as potential sources of power, for those Christians who understood how to harness it. The objective assessment of a work of art was immaterial: what mattered to Byzantine writers was the "meaning" for which the statue served merely as a vehicle.<ref>Liz James and R. Webb, "'To understand ultimate things and enter secret places': Ekphrasis and art in Byzantium", ''Art History'' '''14''' (1991:1-17).</ref> With no sense of "[[Antiquity]]", the Byzantines did not distance themselves or their art from their East Roman forebears, and had no sense that their interpretations of subject matter, often given Christian reidentifications, or the artistic style in which these representations were dressed, had drifted; by contrast, "we notice the distance that separates the Byzantines from the original meaning of pagan statues", given new identities as Christian figures or Emperors.<ref>Saradi-Mendelovici 1990:58.</ref>
