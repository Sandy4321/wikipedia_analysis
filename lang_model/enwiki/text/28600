It was the home of the various incarnations of [[Dover F.C.]] from 1931 until the club folded in 1983.  Since then it has been the home of [[Dover Athletic F.C.]], and it was also the temporary home of [[Margate F.C.]] between 2002 and 2004, when the club's [[Hartsdown Park]] stadium was being redeveloped.  The stadium has two seated stands and two covered terraces and holds a total of 6,000 fans, although in the past, crowds larger than that figure could be accommodated.  It also has a clubhouse, which the club is in the process of redeveloping.

==History==
[[Image:Crabble1890s.jpg|thumb|left|The Crabble Meadows area shortly after the Athletic Ground was laid out in 1897]]
In 1896, a syndicate of local businessmen began a project to create a sports complex at the site known as Crabble Meadows on the outskirts of [[Dover]].  The word ''Crabble'', which is also found in the name of a local corn mill,<ref name="crabblemill">{{cite web|url=http://www.ccmt.org.uk/|title=Crabble Corn Mill|publisher=Crabble Corn Mill Trust|accessdate=2008-02-04}}</ref> derives from the [[Old English]] ''crabba hol'', meaning a hole in which crabs are found.<ref name="crabble">{{cite web|url=http://www.dover-kent.co.uk/history/name_origin.htm|title=The Origin of Dover's Name|publisher=Dover-Kent.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref>  The project was an extremely costly one but was completed in 1897,<ref name="CrCr">{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/england/content/ground/56957.html|title=Crabble Athletic Ground, Dover, England|publisher=CricInfo (reprinted from ''Playfair Cricket Monthly'', 1965)|accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref> and football was first played on the Crabble site in the same year.<ref name="Cr2" />  In 1902, the original owners of the site, beset by financial problems, contemplated selling the land for redevelopment but eventually sold the site to the [[town council]] for <U+00A3>5,500.<ref name="CrCr" />  The pitch was shared by the town's [[cricket]] and football teams, with the cricketers being given priority, which meant that the football team was forced to begin and end its season either with a long run of consecutive [[Road (sports)|away]] matches or by playing matches at other, less satisfactory, venues in the town.  To resolve the issue, the council opted to lay out a new football pitch further up the hillside, behind the lower pitch's pavilion.  The first match played on the "upper pitch" took place in September 1931, with a small stand being constructed the following year.  The football club then used the upper pitch whenever the lower pitch was unavailable due to cricket commitments.<ref name="Cr9">{{cite web|url=http://talesftre.tripod.com/doverfootballclub/id7.html|title=The Grounds|publisher=The History of Dover Football Club|accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref>

Dover F.C. applied for permission to build a grandstand on the southern side of the "upper pitch" in 1947, but the application was rejected.  Three years later, the club was permitted to extend the existing small stand on the opposite side and in 1951, Dover F.C. moved to the upper pitch on a permanent basis, initially paying the council rent of <U+00A3>300 a year.<ref name="Cr2">{{cite web|url=http://www.pyramidpassion.co.uk/html/dover_athletic.html|title=Dover Athletic F.C.
|publisher=Pyramid Passion|accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref>  The final match on the lower pitch took place on [[26 March]] [[1951]], and the first on the upper pitch was held eleven days later, when [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] were Dover's opponents in a [[Exhibition match|friendly]].  Due to a shortage of bolts, the grandstand had not actually been completed at this time.<ref name="Cr" /> Covered terracing at the Town End, where fans had previously stood on the hillside, was added soon afterwards.<ref name="Cr2" /> Floodlights were added in 1961 and inaugurated with a match against a [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] XI.<ref name="Cr" />

Dover F.C folded in 1983, but the newly-formed Dover Athletic took over the ground and continued to make improvements. When the team won the [[Southern League (football)|Southern League]] championship in 1990, however, promotion to the [[Football Conference]] was refused on the grounds that the stadium did not meet the standard required by the higher division.<ref>{{cite book | first=Bill|last=Bateson |coauthors=Albert Sewell | title=News of the World Football Annual 1990/91|   publisher=Invincible Press | year=1990| id=ISBN 0-8854-3207-1|pages=p122}}</ref>  Subsequently, new turnstiles were installed and two new terraces were built behind the goals. The seating in the main stand was replaced and a second grandstand was added on the opposite side of the pitch. These improvements meant that the club was able to gain promotion after its second Southern League title in 1993.<ref name="Cr2" />  In the [[2002-03 in English football|2002&ndash;03]] and [[2003-04 in English football|2003&ndash;04]] seasons, [[Margate F.C.]] played home [[fixtures]] at the stadium while redevelopment work took place at their own [[Hartsdown Park]] ground.<ref>{{Cite web

Between 2003 and 2004, the ground was known as the [[Hoverspeed]] Stadium under the terms of a sponsorship deal.<ref name="hov">{{cite web|url=http://www.nonleaguedaily.com/news/index.php?newsmode=FULL&nid=10104|title=New sponsorship deal for Dover brings new ground name

==Structure and facilities==
[[Image:PlanOfCrabble.png|thumb|right|A plan of the ground]]
The stadium is known for its unusual location, being set into the side of a hill.  It has two seated stands and two covered terraces. The Main Stand, which has been in place since 1951, occupies the length of one side of the [[Football pitch|pitch]] and has a roof supported by numerous columns, which obscure the view for some fans.  Identical covered terraces for standing spectators are behind both goals, which also suffer from an obstructed view. The small Family Stand occupies a portion of the side opposite the Main Stand. The remainder of this side of the ground is taken up by the clubhouse, [[washroom|toilets]] and other club facilities.  Unlike most football stadiums, the club directors' lounge is set atop one of the stands.<ref name="Cr2" />

The stadium is approximately {{convert|1.5|mi|km|0}} from [[Kearsney railway station]], which lies on [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]]'s [[Chatham Main Line]] from [[Victoria Station (London)|London Victoria]] to [[Dover Priory railway station|Dover Priory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livedepartureboards.co.uk/ldb/summary.aspx?T=KSN|title=Live Departures: Kearsney (KSN)|accessdate=2008-04-15|publisher=National Rail Enquiries}}</ref> Dover Priory itself is further away, but connecting bus services are available.<ref name="Cr2" /> Parking is available around the perimeter of the adjacent [[Rugby football|rugby]] club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awads.co.uk/index.php?command=db&page=Dover%20Athletic|title=Dover Athletic|accessdate=2008-04-15|publisher=Association of Wheelchair & Ambulant Disabled Supporters }}</ref>

==Records==
The highest attendance ever recorded at the ground was recorded when "just under 7,000" fans were in attendance for a match between Dover F.C. and [[Folkestone F.C.|Folkestone]] on [[October 13]] [[1951]].<ref name="Cr" /> Current club Dover Athletic's highest ever home attendance was 4,186 for the visit of [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] in the first round proper of the [[FA Cup]] on [[16 November]] [[2002]].<ref name="CD">{{cite book | last=Williams|first=Tony|coauthors=Mike Williams | title=Non-League Club Directory 2007| publisher=Tony Williams Publications Ltd | year=2007| id=ISBN 1-8698-3355-4|page=p515}}</ref>
