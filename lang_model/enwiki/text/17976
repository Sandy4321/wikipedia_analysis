"'''Criminal'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Britney Spears]] from her seventh studio album, ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]''. The song was released as the fourth and final single from the album. "Criminal" was written and produced by [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (producer)|Shellback]], with additional writing by Tiffany Amber. After Spears first listened to the song, she felt it was different and unlike anything she had heard before. She posted a snippet of it online on March 2, 2011, prior to the album's release. "Criminal" was chosen as a single by a poll on her [[Facebook]] page, as Spears explained it was a way to give back to her fans. The artwork for the single was released on September 14, 2011.

"Criminal" is a [[guitar]]-driven mid-tempo song, which incorporates a [[Folk music|folk]]-style flute melody. It is considered the only ballad on ''Femme Fatale'', and is less aggressive than the other songs of the album. "Criminal" is influenced by the works of [[ABBA]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. In the song, Spears sings about being in love with a [[Bad boy (archetype)|bad boy]] and [[outlaw]], and pleads to her mother to not worry about their relationship. "Criminal" received positive critical appreciation, with reviewers praising its organic and refreshing feel in comparison with the rest of the album. After the release of ''Femme Fatale'', the song charted on the South Korean International chart. "Criminal" has also charted in major markets such as Canada, France, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.

The accompanying music video for the song was filmed in [[Dalston]] and [[Stoke Newington]], London. It features Spears as a woman in upper society and follows her relationship with a criminal, played by her real-life boyfriend Jason Trawick. Prior to its release, London officials criticized Spears for shooting scenes with a replica gun and glamorizing violence. The video received positive appreciation from critics, with some calling it the best video from ''Femme Fatale''. Reviewers also noted the parallels between the storyline and themes of the video with Spears's personal life.

==Critical reception==
Andy Gill of ''[[The Independent]]'' called it one of the highlights of ''Femme Fatale'', along with "[[Till the World Ends]]". Gill also said that the album sounds more programmed than natural, commenting that "indeed, such is the shock when the final track, 'Criminal', opens with a little folksong-style flute and guitar figure that one's immediate reaction is that a [[Midlake]] soundfile has been accidentally appended to Britney's running-order."<ref name=independent>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-britney-spears-femme-fatale-jive-2251912.html|title=Album: Britney Spears, Femme Fatale (Jive)|last=Gill|first=Andy|date=March 25, 2011|accessdate=April 8, 2011|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=[[Alexander Lebedev]]}}</ref> Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush gave the song four stars, explaining that "Only Brit can make a flute sound sexy.

===Synopsis===
[[File:Britney Criminal video.png|thumb|300px|right|Spears and her boyfriend Jason Trawick kissing as his house is being shot.]]
The video begins at a formal party in which Spears seems to be looking for someone. The opening shot of her was inspired by the scene of [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] walking into the party in ''[[Can't Hardly Wait]]'' (1998).<ref name=marrsleads/> Her boyfriend (Bradshaw) talks with two people next to her.<ref name=spysynopsis>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a346098/britney-spears-holds-up-convenience-store-in-criminal-video-watch.html|title=Britney Spears holds up convenience store in 'Criminal' video: Watch|last=Goodacre|first=Kate|date=October 18, 2011|accessdate=October 18, 2011|publisher=Digital Spy. Hachette Filipacchi (UK) Ltd}}</ref> He then verbally abuses her and grabs her face, after which she leaves to the toilet, where she wipes a tear and puts on her fragrance [[Radiance (fragrance)|Radiance]]. She comes back to the party and sees her boyfriend flirting with another woman; Spears tells her "So you're not working the street corner tonight I see?", making her boyfriend angry.<ref name=huff/> He then grabs Spears by the arm and carries her outside the building. After he slaps her, one of the waiters of the party (Trawick) wearing a leather jacket punches her boyfriend several times.<ref name=spysynopsis/> The waiter asks Spears if she is okay, and after she kicks her boyfriend in the crotch, she replies "Now I'm okay."<ref name=nymag/> She and the waiter climb on his motorcycle and leave the scene. When they get to his house, it is revealed by a newspaper that he is a criminal. She opens one of the lockers in his house and finds a gun, after which the couple kisses. This is followed by scenes of them having sex. 

The next morning, the criminal brings Spears breakfast to the bed. He has several tattoos in his body, including one on his chest that reads "R.I.P. Goose", a reference to the film ''[[Top Gun]]'' (1986).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dose.ca/music/Britney+Spears+Jason+Trawick+Debut+Criminal+Video+Really+Tattoos/5567497/story.html?cid=dose_nav_drop|title=Britney Spears and Jason Trawick Debut 'Criminal' Video, Really Bad Tattoos|work=[[Dose (magazine)|Dose]]|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]]|date=October 18, 2011|first=Leah|last=Collins|accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref> They go to a convenience store where she steals vanilla candles and points the gun to the employee; the criminal takes money out of the cash register and they escape by stealing a [[Citro<U+00EB>n DS3]].<ref name=idolatormv/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.landingpage.citroen.com/|date=22 October 2011|archivedate=22 October 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62d9GPfE5|title=Citro<U+00EB>n Landing Page|publisher=[[Citro<U+00EB>n]]}}</ref> The robbery is caught by the security cameras, and pictures of the couple appear on the local news. There are scenes of them having sex in the shower. As they change clothes, several policemen then appear outside the criminal's house; they start shooting it as Spears and the man kiss passionately. The policemen then enter the house, and one of them confirms that the couple escaped. The video ends with Spears and the criminal escaping on the motorcycle as the credits roll. One of them reads "No vanilla candles were harmed in the making of this music video." The video also includes intercut scenes of Spears performing dance moves similar to [[Vogue (dance)|voguing]].<ref name=idolatormv/>

===UK controversy===
[[File:Diane Abbott, New Statesman hustings, trimmed.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Hackney North and Stoke Newington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Diane Abbott]] said that Spears contributed to the glamorization of guns with the video.<ref name=hackney/>]]
After pictures of Spears and Trawick carrying replica guns on set surfaced online, the [[Hackney London Borough Council]] criticized her for "promoting gun violence", since the area had been badly affected by the [[2011 England riots]]. The Council told ''[[London Tonight]]'' that they had not agreed to the use of replica guns at Stoke Newington Town Hall, and that they would be raising the matter with the production company. Councillor Ian Rathbone added that Spears should apologize and make a sizeable donation to a Hackney charity "for the rudeness and damage she's done to this community." When asked if she thought the council was overreacting, [[Hackney North and Stoke Newington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Diane Abbott]] insisted: "It is only a music video but it's images like this, with popstars glamorising gangs, which means that some young people... get drawn in. Britney should really know better."<ref name=hackney/> Rae Alexandra of the ''[[SF Weekly]]'' explained that the United Kingdom "is not a place that readily embraces guns. Rather, it's a place where guns are rare, gun licensing is tightly controlled, and the entire establishment has been in a panic about gun use on its streets for the last three years."<ref name=sfweekly>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/shookdown/2011/10/britney_and_rihanna_debut_new.php|title=Britney and Rihanna Debut New Videos <U+2013> and Anti-English Sentiments|last=Alexandra|first=Rae|date=October 25, 2011|accessdate=October 21, 2011|work=[[SF Weekly]]|publisher=Village Voice Media}}</ref> On September 26, 2011, Spears' representatives released a statement to MTV News saying, "The video is a fantasy story featuring Britney's boyfriend, Jason Trawick, which literally plays out the lyrics of a song written three years before the riots ever happened."<ref name=threeyears>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1671542/britney-spears-criminal-video-gun-criticism-response.jhtml|title=Britney Spears Responds To 'Criminal' Video Controversy|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=September 26, 2011|accessdate=September 30, 2011|publisher=MTV.

<blockquote>
"Holding the gun became a controversial thing 'cause we filmed it in London, and they don't have a lot of gun use out there. That doesn't mean that there's no gun use, so I did find it really interesting. For me, the thing is, it blew me away that members of [the British] Parliament were speaking about this. One, because it's a music video, and two, because don't you guys have television shows out there that show crime? It's really strange to me. I don't understand why pop stars are put on such a high pedestal over other celebrities. Why do members of Parliament feel that they need to scrutinize her for having a gun, and 'She's in the public,' and 'She should know better,' and 'She's a role model,' but what about every other celebrity out there? What about every other actor? That's very strange to me. I was really surprised at how much the gun use was scrutinized. [Trawick plays] a a professional criminal, so it makes sense he has a gun. We shouldn't censor ourselves."<ref name=pilierogun>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1672848/britney-spears-criminal-director-gun.jhtml|title=Britney Spears' 'Criminal' Director Talks Gun Controversy|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|last2=White Wolf|first2=Vanessa|date=October 20, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2011|publisher=MTV.

===Themes and analysis===
[[File:Rihanna V Festival 2011 cropped.jpg|thumb|165px|left|The plot and themes of the video received comparisons to that of [[Rihanna]]'s "[[We Found Love (music video)|We Found Love]]", which premiered two days after "Criminal".<ref name=pdrihanna/>]]
Alyssa Rosenberg of [[ThinkProgress]] said that although it is common to see pop stars being assaulted by men in their videos <U+2014>exemplifying [[Rihanna]]'s "[[Man Down]]"<U+2014> the public is aware of Spears's vulnerability, explaining that "we believe she really would choose a guy who would do something like this to her." Rosenberg also stated even though her bad behaviour once she leaves her boyfriend is not directed at him, the fact that he treated her badly is a form of narrative permission for her to rob a store and have sex with the criminal. She also commented that the same narrative works on her previous video with Marrs Piliero for "I Wanna Go".<ref name=think>{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2011/10/19/346770/the-vulnerabilities-of-britney-spears/|title=The Vulnerabilities Of Britney Spears|first=Rosenberg|last=Alyssa|publisher=[[ThinkProgress]]. [[Center for American Progress]]|date=October 21, 2011|accessdate=October 26, 2011}}</ref> The video received comparisons to Rihanna's "[[We Found Love]]", which was released two days after "Criminal", on October 19, 2011.<ref name=sfweekly/><ref name=pdrihanna/> Among the similarities, critics noted that they were both filmed in the United Kingdom and arose controversy in the country; both contain scenes of sex, violence and crime; both feature bad boy archetypes and both evoke the personal lives of the artists.<ref name=pdrihanna>{{cite web|url=http://popdust.com/2011/10/24/rihanna-britney-spears-personal-lives-videos/|title=Britney Spears, Rihanna, And the Videos Ripped From the Rumors|first=Katherine|last=St Asaph|publisher=Popdust. Popdust LLC|date=October 24, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2011}}</ref> Katherine St Asaph found the opening line of Spears's boyfriend ("Would you try smiling ''just once''?") a subtle dig at the press. She explained that there is a tendency among writers and spectators to call "her every smile plastered on or [[Conservatorship|conservator]]-mandated", and that the fact the line is delivered by her abusive boyfriend only makes it more evident. According to her, that there are two contradictory ways to analyze the relationship between Spears and Trawick as the criminal: it could be seen as him luring her into her life, but Spears is the one that kisses him and she is the first to pull the gun.<ref name=pdrihanna/>

St Asaph explained that the only interpretation of the video lies on the opinion of each viewer about Spears's personal life, and how active a role each person imagines she plays in it. It was noted by St Asaph that although most pop stars release videos that draw from their personal lives, they do not make the viewer uncomfortable. The same cannot be said for Spears and Rihanna, and it does not matter if they themselves have moved on from past situations, because the discussion around them has not. St Asaph also expressed that neither Spears or Rihanna said much about the parallels to their lives, but that they do not need to: their videos are much more effective than anything they could reveal in an interview.<ref name=pdrihanna/> Rae Alexandra of the ''SF Weekly'' also compared it to "We Found Love", saying that both videos feature an [[anti-British sentiment]]. She wrote that all the villains in the video <U+2013> her boyfriend and the policemen <U+2013> are British, whereas her savior in the video is an American criminal. Alexandra noted that Spears and Rihanna chose to films their "grittiest videos" in a country with a lower [[crime rate]] than the United States, that is also so against guns that politicians felt the need to talk about it. According to her, the videos continue with a [[xenophobic]] portrayal of British people as villains by American [[pop culture]].<ref name=sfweekly/>
