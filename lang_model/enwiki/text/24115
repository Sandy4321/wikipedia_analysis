The '''Sudan women's national football team''' is an unofficial, non-FIFA recognised team called ''The Challenge'' that plays in a the domestic competition in [[Khartoum]] against teams wearing traditional Muslim garb.  They played their first competitive match in 2006.  No FIFA recognised senior national team has played a single [[FIFA]] recognised game.  The development of a national team faces several challenges faced throughout Africa, along with Sudan specific issues like religion.  Despite this, a women's football exists in the country. There is an additional problem of a fatwa banning the creation of women's team.

Sudan is one of the only two Muslim dominant countries in the region to have a women's league which could help lead to a national team.  From this league, an informal national called "The Challenge" has been created: It is not official.  This national team refuses to wear the [[hijab]] or wear traditional [[Muslim]] clothing while playing. The team is based in [[Khartoum]].  The unofficial national team is not recognised by nor receives support from the [[Sudanese Football Association]].<ref name="M<U+00E5>rtenssonBailey2011">{{cite book|author1=Ulrika M<U+00E5>rtensson|author2=Jennifer Bailey|title=Fundamentalism in the Modern World Vol 2: Fundamentalism and Communication: Culture, Media and the Public Sphere|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2w6A19pcK8QC&pg=PA322|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=19 July 2011|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84885-331-7|pages=320<U+2013>325}}</ref><ref name=lesothoaworld>{{cite news|title=Big game hunters&nbsp;<U+2014> Football|newspaper=The Sunday Times|location=London, England|date=June 3, 2007|accessdate=21 April 2012||first=Jonathan|last=Northcroft|page=12|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AUNB:LSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10D29609A4A30F10&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=1053B823C33F21F9}}</ref> In 2006, the unofficial national team played in their first competitive match.

==Background and development==
Women's football in Africa in general faces several challenges, including  limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses.<ref name="Williams2007-186">{{cite book|author=Jean Williams|title=A Beautiful Game: International Perspectives on Women's Football|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VuIp04RvKX8C&pg=PA157|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=15 December 2007|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-674-1|page=186}}</ref>  At the same time, if quality female players in Africa are developed, many leave their home countries to seek greater football opportunities in places like Northern Europe or the United States.<ref name="Kuhn2011">{{cite book|author=Gabriel Kuhn|title=Soccer Vs. the State: Tackling Football and Radical Politics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BwmsLxiWvnwC&pg=PA34|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=24 February 2011|publisher=PM Press|isbn=978-1-60486-053-5|page=34}}</ref><ref name=fatwa/> Funding for women's football in Africa is also an issue:  Most of the funding for women's football and for the women's national teams comes from [[FIFA]], not the national football association.<ref name="Kuhn2011">{{cite book|author=Gabriel Kuhn|title=Soccer Vs. the State: Tackling Football and Radical Politics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BwmsLxiWvnwC&pg=PA34|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=24 February 2011|publisher=PM Press|isbn=978-1-60486-053-5|page=34}}</ref>
