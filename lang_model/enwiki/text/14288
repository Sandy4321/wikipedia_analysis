'''''Princess Norah''''' was a steamship which operated in British Columbia and southeastern Alaska from 1929 to 1964.  From 1955 to 1958, this ship was called '''''Queen of the North'''''.  From 1958 to 1964, the ship was called '''''Canadian Prince.'''''  This ship should not be confused with the later similarly named motor ferry [[MV Queen of the North|MV ''Queen of the North'']].
==Design and construction==
''Princess Norah'' was built in 1929 at  the [[Fairfields]] shipyard in [[Govan, Scotland]].<ref name = Mills>[http://db.library.queensu.ca/marmus/mills/index.html The New Mills' List, <U+201C>Registered Canadian Steamships 1817-1930 over 75 feet<U+201D>] (accessed 06-17-11).</ref><ref name = Turner237/>  The ship was designed for service to the rugged west coast of [[Vancouver Island]].<ref name = Turner140>Turner, ''Pacific Princesses'', at pages 140 and 144-46.</ref> The ship was 250 feet long, with a beam of 48 feet and 23-foot depth of hold.<ref name = Mills/><ref name = Turner237>Turner, ''Pacific Princesses'', at page 237.</ref>  The overall size of the ship was 2,731 gross tons.<ref name = Turner237/> The powerplant, which drove a single propeller, was a triple expansion [[steam engine]], with cylinder diameters ranging from high pressure to low, of 24, 38 and double low pressure cylinders, of 45 inches diameter each.  Engine stroke was 36 inches.<ref name = Turner237/>  ''Norah'' was built with a bow rudder to assist in navigating in the narrow winding channels of the British Columbia coast.<ref name = Turner140/>  The ship had a capacity for 700 day passengers.  There were an additional 179 berths in 61 [[stateroom|staterooms]] for overnight travellers.<ref name = Turner140/>  The official Canadian registry number was 154848.<ref name = Mills/>

==Operations==
''Princess Norah'' arrived at [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] in early 1929.  Although the original plan was for ''Norah'' to completely replace ''[[Princess Maquinna]]'' on the Vancouver Island west coast route, this never happened.  Instead, ''Maquina'' remained the primary ship on the route, with ''Norah'' being brought on during the summer when traffic was heavier.  In the winter months, ''Maquina'' handled the west coast route alone, and ''Norah'' was used on the [[Inside Passage]] runs to [[Prince Rupert]] or southeast Alaska.  CPR was able to replaced the 25-year old wooden hulled [[Princess Beatrice (steamship)|''Princess Beatrice'']], which was sold to a scrapper, who removed the machinery and converted the hulk into a floating cannery.<ref name = Turner140/>

Communities served by ''Norah'' on the west coast route included, among others,  [[Port Renfrew]], [[Bamfield]], [[Port Alberni]], [[Ucluelet]], [[Tofino]], [[Ahousat]], [[Hesquiat]], [[Nootka]], [[Tahsis]], [[Kyuquot]], [[Quatsino]], [[Jeune Landing]] and [[Port Alice]].  According to a timetable issued July 27, 1935, ''Norah'' would make the west coast route three times a month, each time departing from Victoria at 11 pm.  The first trip would being on Day 1 of the month, with ''Norah'' reaching Port Alice, on the northern end of Vancouver Island, on Day 5.  Norah would tnen return on the same route, reaching Victoria again on day 8.  (Fewer calls were made on the southbound trips.).  The vessel then repeated the trip again on Day 11 and on Day 21.<ref name = Turner140/>

During the [[Second World War]], ''Norah'' and the other ships of the CPR's west coast fleet were painted grey as camouflage, making them look like auxiliary naval ships.<ref name = Turner167>Turner, ''Pacific Princesses'', at 167.</ref>  Also during the war ''Norah'' was also used as a relief vessel for [[Princess Mary (steamship)|''Princess Mary'']] on the [[Gulf Islands]] route.  On April 21, 1943, while on the Gulf Islands route, '' Norah'' ran aground not far from Victoria.  There were no injuries and the vessel was returned to service after undergoing several weeks repair in a drydock.

In 1955, the ship was renamed ''Queen of the North''.<ref name = Mills/>  Under this name, the ship was operated on the Inside Passage as a joint venture with the [[Canadian National Railway]]. <ref name = Turner237/>  In 1958, the ship was transferred to the [[Northland Shipping Company]] and renamed ''Canadian Prince''.<ref name = Mills/><ref name = Turner237/>

==Disposition==
In October 1964 the engines were removed from the ship, and the powerless hulk was converted to the ''Beachcomber'', a floating restaurant and dance hall in [[Kodiak, Alaska]].<ref name = Mills/><ref name = Turner216>Turner, ''Pacific Princesses'', at pages 216 and 218.</ref>
