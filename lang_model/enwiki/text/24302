'''Ben Askren''' (born July 18, 1984) is an American former [[collegiate wrestling|amateur wrestler]] for the [[University of Missouri]] and U.S. [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] team. He is now a [[grappler]], [[mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]] and the former [[Bellator Fighting Championships|Bellator]] [[Welterweight]] Champion and the current [[List of ONE FC champions#Welterweight Championship|ONE FC Welterweight Champion]] known for his effective [[wrestling]] . He is currently ranked as the #5 welterweight in the world by Fight!Magazine<ref name=Fight!Magazine>{{cite web|title=MMA Welterweight Rankings|url=http://www.fightmagazine.com/mma-rankings/mma-welterweight-rankings.asp|publisher=fightmagazine.com|accessdate=4/5/2013}}</ref> and as the #8 welterweight by [[Sherdog]].<ref name=Sherdog>{{cite web|title=Sherdog Official Mixed Martial Arts Rankings|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/rankings/5/Sherdogs-Official-Mixed-Martial-Arts-Rankings-53749|publisher=Sherdog.com|accessdate=7/8/2013}}</ref>

== Wrestling ==
Askren was an assistant [[wrestling]] coach at [[Arizona State University]] and was an American [[collegiate wrestling|amateur wrestler]] for the [[University of Missouri]]. He is a two-time state champion in wrestling at [[Arrowhead High School]] in [[Hartland, Wisconsin]].<ref>http://wrestling.teamusa.org/athletes/ben-askren</ref>

=== Collegiate wrestling ===
{{Refimprove-section|date=July 2014}}
In college, he wrestled in the 174&nbsp;lb. [[weight class]]. He lost the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) championship match to [[Chris Pendleton]] in both 2004 and 2005 before winning it in 2006 and 2007. He is known for his pinning ability (he holds the single-season NCAA pin record); his massive afro, and his "funky", or unorthodox, wrestling style. For example, while being ridden in the 2005 championship match, he attempted to reach around and apply a [[headlock]] to Pendleton, a move that any wrestling coach would disavow. His tall, lanky body <U+2014> in sharp contrast to the squat, muscular physiques of many top wrestlers <U+2014> allows him to attempt moves that most wrestlers could not. This characteristic later led to a challenging transition to freestyle wrestling early in his career, as the freestyle rules differ from folkstyle wrestling and penalize a wrestler for exposing his back.  His younger brother Max also wrestled for Missouri and won a national championship in 2010.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

Askren had a dominant Junior season in 2005<U+2013>06, winning all 45 of the matches he wrestled, pinning in 25 of those matches.{{cn|date=July 2014}} He won the 174 pound weight class easily at both the [[Big 12]] and NCAA Championships. He won his Big 12 finals match 17<U+2013>6 over Jacob Klein of Nebraska and his NCAA finals match 14<U+2013>2 over future two time NCAA champion, [[Dan Hodge Trophy]] winner, and World silver medalist [[Jake Herbert]] of [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]]. Herbert was also undefeated going into the NCAA finals. Askren's season earned him the Outstanding Wrestler award at the NCAA Championships as well as the Dan Hodge Trophy and the Rev Wrestler of the Year.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

Askren continued that dominance going into his Senior year in 2006<U+2013>07, going undefeated again with a record of 42<U+2013>0.{{cn|date=July 2014}} He won his second consecutive NCAA Championship at 174 pounds by defeating yet another future NCAA champion, second-ranked Keith Gavin of Pittsburgh, 8<U+2013>2. Askren finished his collegiate career with an 87 match winning streak. He also became only the second person ever to win the Dan Hodge Trophy twice, as W.I.N. Magazine named the 2007 winner. Askren was also again named the Rev Wrestler of the Year. Additionally, he also received the [[Schalles Award]], named after [[Wade Schalles]] and given to the most prolific pinner at the end of each season.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

Askren finished his collegiate wrestling career with a record of 153<U+2013>8, with 91 of those victories coming by way of fall.{{cn|date=July 2014}} Those 91 pins put him at third on the all-time NCAA [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] pins list. In his four year career at Missouri, Askren only lost to two opponents, Chris Pendleton of Oklahoma St. and Ryan Lange of Purdue.  He was also a four-time [[All American]], including being only the twelfth Division I wrestler ever to be a four-time finalist. Askren was also nominated for an [[ESPY]] in 2007 in the category Best Male College Athlete.
On January 9, 2012 it was announced that Askren would be one of six new inductees to the [[University of Missouri]] Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heartlandconnection.com/sports/story.aspx?id=705673 |title=Six chosen for University of Missouri Athletics Hall of Fame |publisher=KTVO-TV via website |date=2012-01-09 |accessdate=2012-01-10}}</ref>

=== 2008 Olympics ===
{{For|more about wrestling at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Wrestling at the 2008 Summer Olympics}}
In the summer of 2008, Askren defeated national runner-up Tyrone Lewis in two consecutive matches by decision at the US Olympic Trials in Las Vegas, becoming the second University of Missouri wrestler to qualify for the Olympics. [[Sammie Henson]], who also attended Missouri but finished his college wrestling career at [[Clemson University|Clemson]], competed in the 2000 Olympics winning a silver medal. Askren competed in the 74&nbsp;kg. weight class at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. Askren won his first match via pin against Hungarian [[Istv<U+00E1>n Ver<U+00E9>b]]. In his round of 8 match he lost to Cuba's [[Ivan Fundora]] 1<U+2013>3 0<U+2013>4. The Cuban's loss to Russia's [[Buvaisar Saitiev]] in the quarterfinal round ended Askren's hopes of a medal at the 2008 Games.

Askren was asked if inexperience was a factor. Though he was a two-time NCAA champion at the University of Missouri he was relatively new to freestyle after wrestling folkstyle in college. "That wasn't it," he said with tears in his eyes, "I just wasn't good enough. I sucked."{{cn|date=July 2008}}

== Mixed martial arts ==

Askren is a brown belt in [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] and the lead wrestling coach at the [[American Top Team]] school in [[Columbia, Missouri]].<ref>http://www.attmo.com/Instructors.html</ref> In December 2008, he went to [[Coconut Creek, FL]] to train at [[American Top Team]] main school where many top fighters train. He currently{{when|date=July 2014}} trains at Roufusport in [[Milwaukee]], where he is the wrestling coach.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

Asken competed at the 2009 [[ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship]] from September 26<U+2014>27, in Barcelona, Spain. He won his first match against Toni Linden by [[arm triangle choke]]. He lost his second match to [[Pablo Popovitch]], a veteran grappler he had trained with the previous summer, by figure four [[footlock]] early in the match. Popovitch went on to win the championship in the under 77&nbsp;kg (169&nbsp;lb) division.<ref>{{cite web |author=SCHEDULE September 23, 2009 &#8212; sebastianvalle |url=http://adccbarcelona.com/ |title=ADCC WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP BARCELONA 2009 |publisher=Adccbarcelona.com |date=2009-09-23 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref>

Askren also competed at the 2009 [[International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles|FILA]] 2<U+00B0> World Grappling Championship. Askren faced the 2008 World Champion, [[Jacob Volkmann]], in the 84&nbsp;kg [[no-gi]] division. Askren out-wrestled Volkmann and won gold in the category.<ref>{{cite web |author=International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles |url=http://www.fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=567%3Achampionnat-du-monde-a-fort-lauderdale&catid=56%3Aactualite&Itemid=100210 |title=Championnat du Monde en Floride |publisher=Fila-official.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref>

Askren was a participant in [[Bellator Fighting Championships]] [[Bellator Fighting Championships: Season Two|Season 2]] Welterweight Tournament.<ref name=bellator>{{cite web |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/17138/welterweight-prospect-ben-asken-announced-as-bellators-newest-signee.mma|title=Welterweight prospect Ben Askren announced as Bellator's newest signee|publisher=''MMAJunkie.com'' |date=2009-12-09 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> In his first fight, Askren defeated [[Ryan Thomas (fighter)|Ryan Thomas]] via technical submission at [[Bellator 14]] on April 15, 2010.

After [[Jim Wallhead]] was pulled from the tournament, Thomas was given another chance to compete. Thomas defeated [[Jacob McClintock]] by [[Technical knockout|TKO]] in the first round at [[Bellator 15]] and was awarded a rematch with Askren. When the two fought at [[Bellator 19]], Askren came out victorious again with a unanimous 30<U+2013>27 decision after controlling McClintock with [[wrestling]] for three rounds.<ref name=bellator19>{{cite web |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/19230/bellator-19-recap-soto-stops-saraiva-askren-and-hornbuckle-book-finals-date.mma |title=Bellator 19 recap: Soto stops Saraiva; Askren and Hornbuckle book finals date |publisher=''MMAJunkie.com''|date=2010-05-20|accessdate=2010-06-17| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100629161009/http://mmajunkie.com/news/19230/bellator-19-recap-soto-stops-saraiva-askren-and-hornbuckle-book-finals-date.mma| archivedate= 29 June 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

At [[Bellator 22]], Askren defeated [[Dan Hornbuckle]] via unanimous decision with his superior wrestling dominating Hornbuckle for all three rounds, becoming the [[Bellator Fighting Championships: Season Two#Welterweight Tournament Bracket|Bellator Season Two Welterweight Tournament Champion]].<ref name=bellator22>{{cite web |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/19589/bellator-22-recap-dan-hornbuckle-cant-stop-the-funk-ben-askren-claims-tourney-win.mma |title=Bellator 22 recap: Dan Hornbuckle can't stop the funk; Ben Askren claims tourney win|publisher=''MMAJunkie.com''| date=2010-06-17 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

On October 21, 2010 in Philadelphia Askren took on the Bellator Welterweight Champion Lyman Good. Despite being hit with a brutal upkick and almost getting caught in a triangle choke with one minute left, he was able to take down and control Good in every round. Askren won via unanimous decision to win the Bellator Welterweight Championship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2010/10/21/ben-askren-beats-lyman-good-for-bellator-welterweight-title/ |title=Ben Askren Beats Lyman Good for Bellator Welterweight Title |publisher=MMA Fighting |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref>

Askren next returned at [[Bellator 40]] to fight and defeat [[Nick Thompson (fighter)|Nick Thompson]] after taking down and controlling Thompson for all three rounds. Although Askren started off quickly in the third round with a spinning back fist and several other strikes, he was caught with an overhand right by Thompson, causing Askren to take down and control Thompson for the remainder of the round. Askren went on to win by unanimous decision with the scores 30<U+2013>26, 30<U+2013>27, and 30<U+2013>27.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbnation.com/mma/2011/4/9/2101575/bellator-40-results-ben-askren-vs-nick-thompson |title=Bellator 40 Results: Ben Askren Dominates Nick Thompson Over Fifteen Minutes |publisher=SBNation.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref>

Following his unanimous decision win over  Thompson in a non-title affair at [[Bellator 40]] in [[Newkirk, Oklahoma]], Askren revealed that he will relocate to [[Milwaukee]] in the near future to train under [[Duke Roufus]] at Roufusport.<ref>{{cite web|last=Breen |first=Jordan |url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Bellator-Champ-Askren-Milwaukee-Bound-Set-to-Join-Roufusport-Camp-31477 |title=Bellator Champ Askren Milwaukee-Bound, Set to Join Roufusport Camp |publisher=Sherdog.com |date=2011-04-09 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref>

Askren successfully defended his title against season 4 welterweight tournament winner [[Jay Hieron]] at [[Bellator 56]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Leidecker |first=Tim |url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/10-October-Tussles-Worth-Watching-36076 |title=10 October Tussles Worth Watching |publisher=Sherdog.com |date=2011-09-30 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref> following a close split decision.

Askren once again used his top control wrestling to shut down his opponents [[grappling]], and opened a cut on Amoussou's forehead with an elbow strike. The doctor stepped in between the third and fourth rounds, judging the cut too severe for Amoussou to continue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Bellator-86-Results-PlaybyPlay-Updates-49273#ben-askren-karl-amoussou|title=BELLATOR 86 RESULTS: PLAY-BY-PLAY & UPDATES |first=Mike |last=Whitman |publisher=Sherdog |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2013-02-14}}</ref>
