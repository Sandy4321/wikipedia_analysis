"'''Deep Throat'''" is the second episode of the [[The X-Files (season 1)|first season]] of the American [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on September 17, 1993.  It was written by series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], directed by [[Daniel Sackheim]], and featured the first of several guest appearances by [[Jerry Hardin]] as the eponymous [[List of The X-Files characters#Deep Throat|Deep Throat]]. The episode received a strong [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen household rating]] compared to other season one episodes. It has received generally positive reviews, and introduced several elements which would become staples of the series' [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. 

When [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) investigate a possible conspiracy in the US Air Force, Mulder meets a mysterious informant who warns him to stay away from the case. Undeterred, Mulder continues in his investigation and comes closer to the truth than ever before, only to have it snatched away from him again.

== Plot ==
Near Ellens [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] Base in [[Idaho]], Colonel Robert Budahas barricades himself within his home, and is found severely injured and trembling in his bathroom when soldiers burst into his house. Several months later, [[Fox Mulder]] and [[Dana Scully]] meet in a Washington bar to discuss the case, which Budahas' wife Anita has reported as a kidnapping, as her husband was taken during the raid and has not been returned. While using the bar's restroom, Mulder is approached by a mysterious informant named "[[List of The X-Files characters#Deep Throat|Deep Throat]]", who warns him to stay away from the case. Deep Throat also warns Mulder that he is being kept under surveillance, which later proves to be true.

Upon arriving in Idaho, Mulder and Scully meet with Mrs. Budahas. She takes them to talk to a neighbor, whose husband exhibited similar behavior. Scully obtains an appointment with the base director Colonel Kissell, but he refuses to meet with them when they stop by his home immediately afterwards. The agents subsequently meet local reporter Paul Mossinger, who refers them to the Flying Saucer Restaurant. While discussing the existence of UFOs with the owner, Mulder obtains directions to Ellens Air Force Base.

Mulder and Scully drive to the base, where they stay until late at night. Scully, who has been sleeping in the car while Mulder keeps watch on a nearby hill, is awakened when the rear windshield of the car shatters. Shortly afterwards, an excited Mulder shows her a mysterious aircraft performing seemingly impossible maneuvers in the night sky. However, Mulder and Scully are forced to flee when a [[black helicopter]] approaches. As they leave, the agents come across Emil and Zoe, a teenaged couple who often camp nearby the base to watch the UFOs. 

While Mulder treats the pair to a meal at a local diner, they tell him and Scully about the frequent appearances of the lights Mulder saw, and of the nearby base from which they believe the UFOs are launched. Meanwhile, Budahas is returned to his home, but his memory has been erased. After leaving the diner, Mulder and Scully are confronted by a group of black-suited agents, who destroy the photographs they have taken and order them to leave the town.

An indignant Mulder sneaks into Ellens Air Force Base with help from Emil and Zoe. When he arrives there, he sees a triangular shaped craft fly overhead, but he is soon captured by soldiers and has his memory tampered with. Meanwhile, a panicked Scully reencounters Mossinger, who she discovers is actually a security operative for the base. Holding him at gunpoint, she forces him to guide her to the base where she exchanges him for Mulder. Mulder and Scully, defeated, return to Washington. Days later, Mulder encounters Deep Throat again while jogging at a local track. Mulder asks Deep Throat if "they" really are present on Earth. Deep Throat responds "Mr. Mulder, ''they'' have been here for a long, long time."<ref name="plot1">Lowry, pp.102<U+2013>103</ref><ref name="plot2">Lovece, pp.47<U+2013>48</ref>

== Production ==
=== Conception ===
This episode marked Jerry Hardin's first appearance in the role  of Deep Throat, who was named after [[Deep Throat|the Watergate informant]].<ref name="prod">Lowry, p.103</ref><ref name="prod1">Edwards, p.37</ref> Hardin would play the character several more times in the show's first season, with sporadic appearances in later seasons. According to series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], it was evident that ''[[The X-Files]]'' was a "series in making" during this episode. The episode was inspired by common [[ufology]]. Believers in aliens have for long thought that [[Nevada]]'s [[Area 51]] and [[Nellis Air Force Base]] have alien technology captured during 1947's [[Roswell UFO incident]]. The name Ellens Air Force Base was derived from the name of Carter's old college girlfriend, whose last name was Ellens. The story's military project was inspired by a rumor that the [[United States Air Force]] had started a project named the Aurora Project. Carter said he remembered people talking about this rumor and that its inclusion in the story was a "nod" to that rumor.<ref name="Commentary"/>

=== Pre-production ===
The scene with [[David Duchovny]] and [[Gillian Anderson]] in the Flying Saucer bar was shot at a Vancouver restaurant called The Meat Market, which according to Carter was a much "divier location than the production designers would have you believe." The surname for the two [[Recurring character|guest character]]s, Budahas, came from an old high school friend Carter knew whose name was Bob Budahas. The name became a running joke for ''The X-Files'' crew over the course of the show. Duchovny and Anderson had never used a gun or held one before joining ''The X-Files'', so they were trained before filming on how to hold them properly so they could appear to be "real FBI agents".<ref name="Commentary">{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]] |date=2005 |title=Audio Commentary for "Deep Throat" |medium= DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|FOX Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>

Carter created the character Deep Throat because he was interested in providing an inside contact for Mulder. Deep Throat was originally inspired by Carter's favorite film, ''[[All the President's Men]]'', and Carter further stated in the [[audio commentary]] that picking [[Jerry Hardin]] for the role was an "easy choice". Hardin was an American actor living in the United States, so he flew up to Vancouver every few weeks to film short scenes with him interacting with the different characters. Carter called Hardin's portrayal "very, very good".<ref name="Commentary"/>

=== Special effects ===
The scenes with the flashing lights are according to [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] the "worst effects we've ever done" on the show. He explained that the main reasons for the effects being poor were money and time; he also commented that [[special effect]]s were still in their infancy. Mat Beck was the special effects producer and supervisor during the [[The X-Files (season 1)|first season]] of the show; he and Carter tried to make the special effects look three dimensional and "better", but were unable to do it. According to Carter, the result looked like a "kind of hi-tech ''[[Pong]]'' game."<ref name="Commentary"/>

The scenes in which [[Fox Mulder]] infiltrates the air base were shot at a real United States airbase. With a small budget and a television schedule to think of, Carter said the effects seemed "good, given the restrictions" they had. The [[UFO]] was digitally made, and was created by a "sort of disco light rig" that was rented from a "party supplier".  Carter commented on [[Daniel Sackheim]]'s shooting, saying it was "shot well". Towards the end of filming these night-time scenes, the sun was beginning to rise so crew member John Bartley had to rig the angles to keep the scenes as dark as possible.<ref name="Commentary"/>

=== Music ===
This episode marks [[Mark Snow]]'s debut as a solo composer for the series. Carter stated he and the production crew were "fearful" of using too much  music in the episode, and the [[The X-Files (season 1)|first season]] as a whole. Anderson's voice over narration towards the end of the episode was inserted after complaints from Fox, who desired more closure to the events of this episode. Fox's complaints were that viewers were not supposed to be "confused" after watching an episode of the series, but must have the slightest idea of what was going on. The voiceovers became a common X-Files technique for the remainder of the series.<ref name="Commentary"/>

==Broadcast and reception==

"Deep Throat" premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX network]] on September 17, 1993, and was first broadcast in the [[United Kingdom]] on [[BBC Two]] on September 24, 1994.<ref name="BBCdate">{{cite DVD-notes |title=The X-Files: The Complete First Season |titlelink=The X-Files (season 1) |titleyear=1993<U+2013>1994 |director=[[Robert Mandel]], [[Daniel Sackheim]], et al |format=booklet |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Corporation|Fox]] }}</ref> This episode earned a [[Nielsen rating|Nielsen household rating]] of 7.3/14, meaning that in the US, roughly 7.3 percent of all television-equipped households, and 14 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode.

In a retrospective of the first season in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', the episode was rated a B+, with praise given to Hardin's "world-weary" performance, though the review noted that that the "querulous, ominous tone" of the episode was "a little awkward, but full of promise of things to come".<ref name="EW review">{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,295174,00.html |title=X Cyclopedia: The Ultimate Episode Guide, Season 1 {{!}} TV {{!}} EW.com |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=November 29, 1996 |accessdate=April 28, 2011}}</ref> Adrienne Martini of the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' called the episode "fun to watch", describing it as "great TV";<ref name="Austin">{{Cite web |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/1997-04-25/528027/ |title=Scanlines - Screens - The Austin Chronicle |author=Adrienne Martini |publisher=[[Austin Chronicle]] |date=April 25, 1997 |accessdate=April 30, 2011}}</ref> whilst the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' called the titular character "the most interesting new character on television", also calling the episode "strange but marvellous".<ref name="Mercury">{{cite news |title=The 'X-Files' Informant is Out There, Speaking on All Kinds of Levels |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&s_site=mercurynews&p_multi=SJ&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB71C18C2422C7A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]] |date=November 19, 1993 |accessdate=April 30, 2011}}</ref> Michael Janusonis of ''[[The Beaver County Times]]'' was more critical of the episode, calling it "an acquired taste" and noting that it "sort of diddled out in the end", lacking "a completely satisfactory resolution".<ref name="Beaver">{{cite news |title='X-Files' episodes offered on tape |author=Michael Janusonis |newspaper=[[The Beaver County Times]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JmAtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vdoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3901,3059271&dq=x+files+deep+throat&hl=en |date=April 14, 1996 |accessdate=April 30, 2011}}</ref>

With elements such as Mulder's first informant Deep Throat, and the affirmation of the wider conspiracy that was to become known as the [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|Syndicate]], "Deep Throat" has been cited as beginning to "set the stage for the central conflicts" of the series.<ref name="Myth-X">Bush, p.41</ref> ''[[IGN]]'''s Dan Iverson felt that the episode served to "open the door to the possibilities of this series".<ref name="IGN">{{cite web |url=http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/639/639716p1.html |title=X-Files Mythology, Vol. 1 - Abduction - DVD Review at IGN |publisher=[[IGN]] |author=Dan Iverson |date=August 5, 2005 |accessdate=May 1, 2011}}</ref> The episode was listed by ''Entertainment Weekly'' as number 37 on its list of "The 100 Greatest Television Moments" of the 1990s.<ref name="EW 100">{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,274576_3,00.html |title=The 100 Greatest Moments in Television: 1990s {{!}} TV {{!}} EW.com |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |author=Bruce Fretts |date=February 19, 1999 |accessdate=April 28, 2011}}</ref>
