'''Lettuce''' (''Lactuca sativa'') is an [[annual plant]] of the aster or sunflower family [[Asteraceae]]. It is most often grown as a [[leaf vegetable]], but also sometimes for its stem and seeds. Lettuce was first cultivated by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, who turned it from a [[weed]] whose seeds were used to make oil into a plant grown for its leaves. It spread to the Greeks and Romans, who gave it the name "''[[lactuca]]''", from which the modern "lettuce" ultimately derives. By 50 AD, multiple types were described, and it appeared often in medieval writings, including several [[herbal]]s. The 16th through 18th centuries saw the development of many [[variety (botany)|varieties]] in Europe, and by the mid-18th century cultivars were described that can still be found in gardens. Europe and North America originally dominated the market for lettuce, but by the late 1900s the consumption of lettuce had spread throughout the world.

Generally grown as a [[Hardiness (plants)|hardy]] annual, lettuce is easily cultivated, although it requires relatively low temperatures to prevent it from quickly flowering. It can be plagued with numerous [[Micronutrient deficiency|nutrient deficiencies]], as well as insect and mammal pests and fungal and bacterial diseases. ''L. sativa'' [[hybrid (biology)|crosses]] easily within the species and with some other species within the ''Lactuca'' genus, and although this trait can be a problem to home gardeners who attempt to save seeds, biologists have used it to broaden the [[gene pool]] of cultivated lettuce varieties. World production of lettuce and [[chicory]] for calendar year 2010 stood at {{convert|23620000|MT|sp=us}}, over half of which came from China.

Lettuce is most often used for salads, although it is also seen in other kinds of food, such as soups, sandwiches and wraps. One type is grown for its stems, which are eaten either raw or cooked. Lettuce is a good source of [[vitamin A]] and [[potassium]], as well as a minor source for several other vitamins and nutrients. Despite its beneficial properties, lettuce when contaminated is often a source of bacterial, viral and parasitic outbreaks in humans, including ''[[E. coli]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]''. In addition to its main use as a leafy green, it has also gathered religious and medicinal significance over centuries of human consumption.

==Description==
[[File:Kropsla vruchten (Lactuca sativa fruits).jpg|thumb|right|Mature lettuce flower and fruits]]
Lettuce's native range spreads between the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Siberia]], although it has been transported to almost all areas of the world.

Some varieties, especially those found in the US and Western Europe, have long, narrow taproots and a small set of secondary roots. Longer taproots and more extensive secondary systems are found in varieties from Asia.<ref name=Ryder/>

Depending on the variety and time of year, lettuce generally lives 65<U+2013>130 days from planting to harvesting. Because lettuce that flowers (through the process known as "[[Bolting (horticulture)|bolting]]") becomes bitter and unsaleable, plants grown for consumption are rarely allowed to grow to maturity. Lettuce flowers more quickly in hot temperatures, while freezing temperatures cause slower growth and sometimes damage to outer leaves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ucanr.org/freepubs/docs/7216.pdf|title=Leaf Lettuce Production in California|author=Smith, Richard; Cahn, Michael; Daugovish, Oleg; Koike, Steven; Natwick, Eric; Smith, Hugh; Subbarao, Krishna; Takele, Etaferahu; Turin, Thomas|publisher=University of California Vegetable Research and Information Center|accessdate=2012-04-11|format=PDF}}</ref> Once plants move past the edible stage, they develop flower stalks up to {{convert|3|ft|m|sigfig=1}} high with small yellow blossoms.<ref name=Weaver175/> Lettuce flowers are composed of multiple [[floret]]s, each containing a [[ligulate]] petal and reproductive system. This system includes fused [[anther]]s that form a tube which surrounds a [[wikt:bipartite#Adjective|bipartite]] [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]]-containing [[style (botany)|style]]. As the anthers shed [[pollen]], the style elongates to allow the stigmas, now coated with pollen, to emerge from the tube.<ref name=Ryder/> The flowers form compressed, [[obovate]] (teardrop-shaped) dry fruits that do not open at maturity, measuring 3 to 4&nbsp;mm long. The fruits have 5<U+2013>7 ribs on each side and are tipped by two rows of small white hairs. Each fruit contains one seed, which can be white, yellow, gray or brown depending on the variety of lettuce.<ref name=Kew>{{cite web|url=http://www.kew.org/science-research-data/kew-in-depth/difficult-seeds/species-profiles/lactuca-sativa/index.htm|title=''Lactuca sativa''|publisher=Kew Royal Botanical Gardens|accessdate=2012-04-02}}</ref>

The domestication of lettuce over the centuries has resulted in several changes through [[selective breeding]]: slower bolting, larger seeds, larger leaves and heads, better taste and texture, a lower [[latex]] content, and different leaf shapes and colors. Work in these areas continues through the present day.<ref name=Davey222>Davey, et al., pp. 222<U+2013>225</ref> Scientific research into the [[genetic modification]] of lettuce is ongoing, with over 85 field trials in progress in the European Union and United States to test modifications allowing greater [[herbicide]] tolerance, greater resistance to insects and fungi and slower bolting patterns. However, genetically modified lettuce is not currently used in commercial agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/database/plants/65.lettuce.html|title=Lettuce|publisher=GMO Compass|accessdate=2012-04-03}}</ref>

==History==

[[File:Lettuce romaine variety.jpeg|thumb|left|Romaine lettuce, a descendent of some of the earliest cultivated lettuce]]
Lettuce was first cultivated in [[ancient Egypt]] for the production of oil from its seeds. This plant was probably selectively bred by the Egyptians into a plant grown for its edible leaves,<ref name=Katz375>Katz and Weaver, pp. 375<U+2013>376</ref> with evidence of its cultivation appearing as early as 2680 BC.<ref name=Weaver170/> Lettuce was considered a sacred plant of the reproduction god [[Min (god)|Min]], and it was carried during his festivals and placed near his images. The plant was thought to help the god "perform the sexual act untiringly."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Q1LAiPylZm4C&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&dq=lettuce+in+egyptian+ritual&source=bl&ots=4itqEJFLXw&sig=5GSUfBm5sU_QcVOXMrQNtlY9S5Y&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Dw97T9OALYXyggewivGAAw&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=lettuce%20in%20egyptian%20ritual&f=false|author=Hart, George|title=The Routledge Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses|edition=2nd|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=1-134-28424-1|page=95}}</ref> Its use in religious ceremonies resulted in the creation of many images in tombs and wall paintings. The cultivated variety appears to have been about {{convert|30|in|cm}} tall and resembled a large version of the modern [[romaine lettuce]]. These upright lettuces were developed by the Egyptians and passed to the Greeks, who in turn shared them with the Romans. Circa 50 AD, Roman agriculturalist [[Columella]] described several lettuce varieties&nbsp;<U+2013> some of which may have been ancestors of today's lettuces.<ref name=Weaver170>Weaver, pp.&nbsp;170<U+2013>172</ref>

Lettuce appears in many medieval writings, especially as a medicinal herb. [[Hildegard of Bingen]] mentioned it in her writings on medicinal herbs between 1098 and 1179, and many early [[herbal]]s also describe its uses. In 1586, [[Joachim Camerarius]] provided descriptions of the three basic modern lettuces&nbsp;<U+2013> head lettuce, loose-leaf lettuce and romaine or cos lettuce.<ref name=Weaver172/> Lettuce was first brought to the Americas from Europe by [[Christopher Columbus]] in the late 15th century.<ref name=CDC/><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DxrMm9lMFUAC&pg=PA313&dq=Christopher+Columbus+lettuce+new+world&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Od9wT9fwDsiviAKBn9WBDQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Christopher%20Columbus%20lettuce%20new%20world&f=false|chapter=Lettuce Diseases: Ecology and Control|author=Subbarao, Krishna V. and Koike, Steven T.|title=Encyclopedia of Pest Management, Volume 2|editor=Pimentel, David|publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=1-4200-5361-2|page=313}}</ref> Between the late 16th century and the early 18th century, many varieties were developed in Europe, particularly Holland. Books published in the mid-18th and early 19th centuries describe several varieties found in gardens today.<ref name=Weaver173>Weaver, pp.&nbsp;172<U+2013>173</ref>

Due to its short life span after harvest, lettuce was originally sold relatively close to where it was grown. The early 1900s saw the development of new packing, storage and shipping technologies that improved the lifespan and transportability of lettuce and resulted in a significant increase in availability.<ref name=CommProfile/> During the 1950s, lettuce production was revolutionized with the development of vacuum cooling, which allowed field cooling and packing of lettuce, replacing the previously used method of ice-cooling in packing houses outside the fields.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ucce.ucdavis.edu/files/repositoryfiles/ca1011p3-64576.pdf|format=PDF|title=House Packing Western Lettuce|author=Enochian, R.V. and Smith, F.J|journal=California Agriculture|date=November 1956}}</ref> 

Lettuce is very easy to grow, and as such has been a significant source of sales for many seed companies. Tracing the history of many varieties is complicated by the practice of many companies, particularly in the US, of changing a variety's name from year to year. This was done for several reasons, the most prominent being to boost sales by promoting a "new" variety or to prevent customers from knowing that the variety had been developed by a competing seed company. Documentation from the late 19th century shows between 65 and 140 distinct varieties of lettuce, depending on the amount of variation allowed between types&nbsp;<U+2013> a distinct difference from the 1,100 named lettuce varieties on the market at the time. Names also often changed significantly from country to country.<ref>Weaver, pp.&nbsp;173<U+2013>174</ref> Although most lettuce grown today is used as a vegetable, a minor amount is used in the production of [[tobacco-free cigarettes]]; however, domestic lettuce's wild relatives produce a leaf that visually more closely resembles tobacco.<ref name=Katz377/>

==Cultivation==
A [[Hardiness (plants)|hardy]] annual, some varieties of lettuce can be [[Overwintering|overwintered]] even in relatively cold climates under a layer of straw, and older, [[heirloom variety|heirloom varieties]] are often grown in [[cold frame]]s.<ref name=Weaver173/> Lettuces meant for the cutting of individual leaves are generally planted straight into the garden in thick rows. Heading varieties of lettuces are commonly started in flats, then transplanted to individual spots, usually {{convert|8|to|14|in|cm}} apart, in the garden after developing several leaves. Lettuce spaced further apart receives more sunlight, which improves color and nutrient quantities in the leaves. Pale to white lettuce, such as the centers in some iceberg lettuce, contain few nutrients.<ref name=Weaver175/>

[[File:Planche Lactuca sativa.jpg|thumb|left|A transplanted bed of lettuce in a [[greenhouse]]]]
Lettuce grows best in full sun in loose, [[nitrogen]]-rich soils with a [[soil pH|pH]] of between 6.0 and 6.8. Heat generally prompts lettuce to bolt, with most varieties growing poorly above {{convert|75|F|C}}; cool temperatures prompt better performance, with {{convert|60|to|65|F|C}} being preferred and as low as {{convert|45|F|C}} being tolerated. Plants in hot areas that are provided partial shade during the hottest part of the day will bolt more slowly. Temperatures above {{convert|80|F|C}} will generally result in poor or non-existent germination of lettuce seeds.<ref name=Bradley129/> After harvest, lettuce lasts the longest when kept at {{convert|32|F|C}} and 96 percent humidity. Lettuce quickly degrades when stored with fruit such as apples, pears and bananas that release the ripening agent [[ethylene|ethylene gas]]. The high water content of lettuce (94.9 percent) creates problems when attempting to preserve the plant&nbsp;<U+2013> it cannot be successfully frozen, canned or dried and must be eaten fresh.<ref name=UI/>

Lettuce varieties will [[Hybrid (biology)|cross]] with each other, making spacing of {{convert|5|to|20|ft|m}} between varieties necessary to prevent contamination when saving seeds. Lettuce will also cross with ''[[Lactuca serriola]]'' (wild lettuce), with the resulting seeds often producing a plant with tough, bitter leaves. [[Celtuce]], a lettuce variety grown primarily in Asia for its stems, crosses easily with lettuces grown for their leaves.<ref name=Weaver175>Weaver, pp.&nbsp;175<U+2013>176</ref> This propensity for crossing, however, has led to breeding programs using closely related species in ''Lactuca'', such as ''L. serriola'', ''[[Lactuca saligna|L. saligna]]'', and ''[[Lactuca virosa|L. virosa]]'', to broaden the available [[gene pool]]. Starting in the 1990s, such programs began to include more distantly related species such as ''[[Lactuca tatarica|L. tatarica]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/85/11/1517 | title = Phylogenetic relationships among ''Lactuca'' (Asteraceae) species and related genera based on ITS-1 DNA sequences | author = Koopman, Wim J.M.; Guetta, Eli; van de Wiel, Clemens C.M.; Vosman, Ben; van den Berg, Ronald G | journal = American Journal of Botany | year = 1998 | volume = 85 | pages = 1517<U+2013>1530 | doi = 10.2307/2446479 | jstor = 2446479 | issue = 11 | pmid = 21680311}}</ref> Seeds keep best when stored in cool conditions, and, unless stored [[cryogenics|cryogenically]], remain viable the longest when stored at {{convert|-4|F|C}}; they are relatively short lived in storage.<ref name=Kew/> At room temperature, lettuce seeds remain viable for only a few months. However, when newly harvested lettuce seed is stored cryogenically, this life increases to a [[half-life]] of 500 years for vaporized nitrogen and 3,400 years for liquid nitrogen; this advantage is lost if seeds are not frozen promptly after harvesting.<ref>Davey, et al., p. 241</ref>

===Cultivars===
[[File:Lettuce mix.jpg|thumb|right|A selection of lettuce cultivars]]
There are several types of lettuce, but three (leaf, head and cos or romaine) are the most common.<ref name=Bradley129>Bradley, p. 129</ref> There are seven main cultivar groups of lettuce, each including many varieties:
* Leaf&nbsp;<U+2013> Also known as looseleaf, cutting or bunching lettuce,<ref name=WSU/> this type has loosely bunched leaves and is the most widely planted. It is used mainly for salads.<ref name=UI>{{cite web|url=http://urbanext.illinois.edu/veggies/lettuce.cfm|title=Lettuce|publisher=University of Illinois Extension|accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref>
* [[Romaine lettuce|Romaine]]/Cos&nbsp;<U+2013> Used mainly for salads and sandwiches, this type forms long, upright heads.<ref name=UI/> This is the most often used lettuce in [[Caesar salad]]s.<ref name=CDC>{{cite web|url=http://www.fruitsandveggiesmatter.gov/month/lettuce.html|title=Vegetable of the Month: Lettuce|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2012-03-26}}</ref>
* Crisphead&nbsp;<U+2013> Better known as the "iceberg" lettuce, the most popular lettuce in the US, this type is very heat-sensitive and was originally adapted for growth in the northern US. It ships well, but is low in flavor and nutritional content, being composed of even more water than other lettuce types.<ref name=UI/>
* Butterhead&nbsp;<U+2013> Also known as Boston or Bibb lettuce,<ref name=WSU/> this type is a head lettuce with a loose arrangement of leaves, known for its sweet flavor and tender texture.<ref name=UI/>
* Summercrisp&nbsp;<U+2013> Also called Batavian or French Crisp, this lettuce is midway between the crisphead and leaf types. These lettuces tend to be larger, bolt-resistant and well-flavored.<ref name=WSU>{{cite web|url=http://vegetables.wsu.edu/winterlettuce.html|title=Winter Lettuce|publisher=Washington State University|accessdate=2012-03-26|author=Miles, Carol}}</ref>
* [[Celtuce|Stem]]&nbsp;<U+2013> This type is grown for its seedstalk, rather than its leaves, and is used in Asian cooking, primarily Chinese, as well as stewed and creamed dishes.<ref name=UI/>
* Oilseed&nbsp;<U+2013> This type is grown for its seeds, which are pressed to extract an oil mainly used for cooking. It has few leaves, bolts quickly and produces seeds around 50 percent larger than other types of lettuce.<ref>Katz and Weaver, p. 375</ref>
The butterhead and crisphead types are sometimes known together as "cabbage" lettuce, because their heads are shorter, flatter, and more cabbage-like than romaine lettuces.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SsQ8XBJkGG8C&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&dq=crisphead+cabbage+lettuce&source=bl&ots=z5omQjsCMN&sig=QBlnrfme9WNR8FuDMO9ddVwNxjc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8upwT_PKIfDViALb9dyzDA&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=crisphead%20cabbage%20lettuce&f=false|title=The Organic Salad Garden|page=12|author=Larkcom, Joy and Phillips, Roger|publisher=Frances Lincoln Ltd|year=2003|isbn=0-7112-2204-5}}</ref>

=== Cultivation problems ===
{{see also|List of lettuce diseases}}
[[File:Starr 081031-0356 Lactuca sativa.jpg|thumb|right|A lettuce surrounded by weeds, which have crowded it to the point of bolting]]
Nutrient deficiencies, including a lack of [[boron]], [[phosphorus]], [[calcium]], [[molybdenum]] or [[copper]], can cause a variety of plant problems that range from malformed plants to a lack of head growth.<ref name=Bradley129/> Many insects are attracted to lettuce, including [[cutworm]]s, which cut plants off at the soil line; [[wireworm]]s and [[nematode]]s, which cause yellow, stunted plants; [[tarnished plant bug]]s and [[aphid]]s, which cause yellow, distorted leaves; [[leafhopper]]s, which cause stunted growth and pale leaves; [[thrip]]s, which turn leaves gray-green or silver; [[leafminer]]s, which create tunnels within the leaves; [[flea beetle]]s, which cut small holes in leaves and [[caterpillar]]s, [[slug]]s and [[snail]]s, which cut large holes in leaves. Mammals, including rabbits and groundhogs, also eat the plants.<ref name=Bradley132>Bradley, pp.&nbsp;129<U+2013>132</ref> Lettuce contains several defensive compounds, including [[sesquiterpene lactone]]s, and other natural phenolics such as [[flavonol]] and [[Flavonols#Flavonols glycosides|glycosides]], which help to protect it against pests; certain varieties contain more than others, and some selective breeding and genetic modification studies have focused on identifying and producing varieties with larger amounts of these compounds for increased pest resistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reeis.usda.gov/web/crisprojectpages/198636.html|title=Developing Multi-Species Insect Resistance in Romaine Lettuce|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref>

Lettuce also suffers from several [[Plant virus|viral diseases]], including [[Lettuce big-vein disease|big vein]], which causes yellow, distorted leaves, and [[mosaic virus]], which is spread by aphids and causes stunted plant growth and deformed leaves. [[Aster yellows]] are a disease-causing bacteria carried by leafhoppers, which causes deformed leaves. Fungal diseases include [[powdery mildew]] and [[downy mildew]], which cause leaves to mold and die and [[Fungicide use in the United States#Bottom rot|bottom rot]], [[Fungicide use in the United States#Lettuce drop|lettuce drop]] and [[gray mold]], which cause entire plants to rot and collapse.<ref name=Bradley132/> Crowding lettuce tends to attract pests and diseases.<ref name=Weaver175/> Weeds can also be an issue, as cultivated lettuce is generally not competitive with them, especially when directly seeded into the ground. Transplanted lettuce (started in flats and later moved to growing beds) is generally more competitive initially, but can still be crowded later in the season, causing misshapen lettuce and lower yields. Weeds also act as homes for insects and disease and can make harvesting more difficult.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/r441700111.html|title=Lettuce: Integrated Weed Management|work=UC Pest Management Guidelines|publisher=University of California|date=August 2007|accessdate=2012-04-03}}</ref> Herbicides are often used to control weeds in commercial production. However, this has led to the development of herbicide-resistant weeds and prompted environmental and health concerns.<ref name=Davey222/>

Western Europe and North America were the original major markets for large-scale lettuce production. By the late 1900s, Asia, South America, Australia and Africa became more substantial markets. Different locations tended to prefer different types of lettuce, with butterhead prevailing in northern Europe and Great Britain, romaine in the Mediterranean and stem lettuce in China and Egypt. By the late 20th century, the preferred types began to change, with crisphead, especially iceberg, lettuce becoming the dominant type in northern Europe and Great Britain and more popular in western Europe. In the US, no one type predominated until the early 20th century, when crisphead lettuces began gaining popularity. After the 1940s, with the development of iceberg lettuce, 95 percent of the lettuce grown and consumed in the US was crisphead lettuce. By the end of the century, other types began to regain popularity and eventually made up over 30 percent of production.<ref name=Katz378>Katz and Weaver, p. 378</ref> Stem lettuce was first developed in China, and remains primarily cultivated in that country.<ref name=Simoons>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Fo087ZxohA4C&pg=PA148&lpg=PA148&dq=lettuce+consumption+in+china&source=bl&ots=7TUyOHVlR_&sig=577j7r7qqF5ndBhKuBeXzufAZK4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QLLvT7HFBcWqrQG3zKSOAg&ved=0CGMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=lettuce%20consumption%20in%20china&f=false|title=Food in China: A Cultural and Historical Inquiry|author=Simoons, Frederick J.|pages=147<U+2013>148|isbn=0-8493-8804-X|publisher=CRC Press|year=1991}}</ref>

Lettuce production methods, including all of the processes from growing to sales, have become much larger in scale during the 20th century. The majority of agricultural production is done with the application of large amounts of chemicals, including [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s, but [[organic production]] makes up a growing percentage of the market&nbsp;<U+2013> a trend that began with small growers but moved to a more industrial scale. More non-heading types, mostly leaf and romaine lettuces, are also being grown.<ref name=Katz378/> In the first years of the 21st century, bagged salad products began to hold a growing portion of the lettuce market, especially in the US. Processed from what was previously waste lettuce not considered acceptable for the fresh market, these products are packaged in a manner that makes them last longer than standard head lettuce after harvest.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Lettuce Grows Into A Processed Food|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/aug/19/business/fi-lettuce19|journal=Los Angeles Times|author=Fulmer, Melinda|date=August 19, 2002|accessdate=2012-06-30}}</ref> As of 2007, 70 percent of the lettuce production in the US came from [[California]]; in that country it ranks third in [[produce]] consumption behind tomatoes and oranges.<ref>Davey, et al., p. 222</ref>

==Culinary use==
As described around 50 AD, lettuce leaves were often cooked and served by the Romans with an oil and vinegar dressing; however, smaller leaves were sometimes eaten raw. During the 81<U+2013>96 AD reign of [[Domitian]], the tradition of serving a lettuce salad before a meal began. Post-Roman Europe continued the tradition of [[poaching]] lettuce, mainly with large romaine types, as well as the method of pouring a hot oil and vinegar mixture over the leaves.<ref name=Weaver170/> Today, the majority of lettuce is grown for its leaves, although one type is grown for its stem and one for its seeds, which are made into an oil.<ref name=Katz375/> Most lettuce is used in salads, either alone or with other greens, vegetables, meats and cheeses. Romaine lettuce is often used for [[Caesar salad]]s, with a dressing that includes [[anchovy|anchovies]] and eggs. Lettuce leaves can also be found in soups, sandwiches and wraps, while the stems are eaten both raw and cooked.<ref name=Katz376/> The consumption of lettuce in China developed differently than in Western countries, due to health risks and cultural aversion to eating raw leaves. In that country, "salads" were created from cooked vegetables and served hot or cold. Lettuce was also used in a larger variety of dishes than in Western countries, contributing to a range of dishes including [[bean curd]] and meat dishes, soups and [[stir-fry]]s plain or with other vegetables. Stem lettuce, widely consumed in China, is eaten either raw or cooked, the latter primarily in soups and stir-frys.<ref name=Simoons/>

Depending on the variety, lettuce is a good source of [[vitamin A]] and [[potassium]], with higher concentrations of vitamin A found in darker green lettuces. It also provides some dietary fiber (concentrated in the spine and ribs), carbohydrates, protein and a small amount of fat. With the exception of the iceberg type, lettuce also provides some [[vitamin C]], calcium, [[iron]] and copper, with vitamins and minerals largely found in the leaf.<ref name=UI/>

===Food-borne illness===
Although most [[food-borne illness|food-borne]] [[pathogen]]s can survive on stored lettuce, they tend to decline in number during the storage period. The exception to this is ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'', the causative agent of [[listeriosis]], which multiplies in storage. However, despite very high levels of the bacteria being found on ready-to-eat lettuce products, a 2008 study found no incidences of food-borne illness related to listeriosis. The researcher posited that this may be due to the product's short shelf life, indigenous microflora competing with the ''Listeria'' bacteria or possible properties within the lettuce that cause the bacteria to be unable to cause listeriosis.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Precut prepackaged lettuce: a risk for listeriosis?|author=Hanning, I.B.; Johnson, M.G.; Ricke, S.C|journal=Foodborne Pathogens and Disease|date=December 2008|volume=5|issue=6|pages=731<U+2013>746|pmid=18847382|doi=10.1089/fpd.2008.0142}}</ref>

Other bacteria found on lettuce include ''[[Aeromonas]]'' species, which have not been linked to any outbreaks; ''[[Campylobacter]]'' species, which cause [[campylobacteriosis]] and ''[[Yersinia intermedia]]'' and ''[[Yersinia kristensenii]]'' (species of ''[[Yersinia]]''), which have been found mainly in lettuce.<ref name=FDA>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/ScienceResearch/ResearchAreas/SafePracticesforFoodProcesses/ucm091265.htm|title=Chapter IV.

===Medicinal lore===
In addition to its usual purpose as an edible leafy vegetable, lettuce has had a number of uses in ancient (and even some more modern) times as a medicinal herb and religious symbol. For example, ancient Egyptians thought lettuce to be a symbol of sexual prowess<ref name=Katz378/> and a promotor of love and childbearing in women, and the Romans likewise claimed that it increased sexual potency.<ref name=Watts226>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Plant Lore|author=Watts, Donald|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WAagnZNb0cAC&pg=PA226&dq=Medicinal+uses+of+lettuce&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4xVtT8XVOKiniQKbh6zDBQ&ved=0CF8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Medicinal%20uses%20of%20lettuce&f=false|publisher=Academic Press|year=2007|isbn=0-12-374086-X|page=226}}</ref> In contrast, the ancient Greeks connected the plant with male impotency<ref name=Weaver170/> and served it during funerals (probably due to its role in the myth of [[Adonis]]'s death), and British women in the 1800s believed it would cause infertility and sterility. Lettuce has mild [[narcotic]] properties&nbsp;<U+2013> it was called "sleepwort" by the [[Anglo-Saxons]] because of this attribute&nbsp;<U+2013> although the cultivated ''L. sativa'' has lower levels of the narcotic than its wild cousins.<ref name=Watts226/> This narcotic effect is a property of two sesquiterpene lactones, located in the white liquid in the stems of lettuce, called latex.<ref name=Katz377>Katz and Weaver, p. 377</ref>

Lettuce extracts are sometimes used in skin creams and lotions for treating sunburn and rough skin. It was once thought to be useful in relieving [[liver]] issues. Some American settlers claimed that [[smallpox]] could be prevented through the ingestion of lettuce,<ref name=Watts226/> and an Iranian belief suggested consumption of the seeds when afflicted with [[typhoid]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UcLYLpwdcm8C&pg=PA230#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=232|title=Duke's Handbook of Medicinal Plants of the Bible|author=Duke, James A.; Duke, Peggy-Ann K.; DuCellie, Judith L.|publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=0-8493-8202-5}}</ref> Folk medicine has also claimed it as a treatment for pain, [[rheumatism]], tension and nervousness, coughs and insanity; scientific evidence of these benefits in humans has not been found, although some similar effects have been demonstrated in mice and toads.<ref name=Katz377/> The religious ties of lettuce continue into the present day among the [[Yazidi]] people of northern Iraq, who have a religious prohibition against eating the plant.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E5DF1E3FF930A35752C0A9659C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=Bashiqa Journal: A Sect Shuns Lettuce and Gives the Devil His Due |first=Neil |last=MacFarquhar |authorlink=Neil MacFarquhar |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2003-01-03 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref>
