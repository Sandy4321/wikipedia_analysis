'''''The Great Ziegfeld''''' is a 1936  [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] [[musical film]] directed by [[Robert Z. Leonard]] and produced by [[Hunt Stromberg]]. It stars [[William Powell]] as the theatrical [[impresario]] [[Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr.|Florenz "Flo" Ziegfeld, Jr.]], [[Luise Rainer]] as [[Anna Held]], and [[Myrna Loy]] as [[Billie Burke]]. 

The film, shot at MGM Studios in [[Culver City, California]] in the fall of 1935, is a fictionalized tribute to Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. and a cinematic adaption of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]'s [[Ziegfeld Follies]], with highly elaborate costumes, dances and sets. Many of the performers of the theatrical Ziegfeld Follies were cast in the film as themselves, including [[Fanny Brice]] and [[Harriet Hoctor]], and Billie Burke acted as a supervisor for the film. The "[[A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody]]" set alone was reported to have cost US$220,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|220000|1936}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}),{{sfn|Green|1999|p=54}} featuring a towering rotating volute of 70 ft diameter with 175 spiral steps, weighing 100 tons. The music to the film was provided by [[Walter Donaldson]], [[Irving Berlin]], and lyricist [[Harold Adamson]], with choreographed scenes. The extravagant costumes were designed by [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]], taking some 250 tailors and seamstresses six months to prepare them using {{convert|50|lb}} of silver sequins and {{convert|12|yd|m}} of white [[ostrich]] plumes. Over a thousand people were employed in the production of the film, which required 16 reels of film after the cutting.

One of the biggest successes in film in the 1930s and the pride of MGM at the time, it was acclaimed as the greatest musical biography to be made in Hollywood and still remains a standard in musical film making. It won three [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] for producer [[Hunt Stromberg]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for [[Louise Rainer]], and [[Academy Award for Best Dance Direction|Best Dance Direction]] for [[Seymour Felix]], and was nominated for four others. Although the film is still praised for its lavish production and as a symbol of glamor and excess during the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age of Hollywood]], today ''The Great Ziegfeld'' is generally seen less favorably and is considered by many critics to be excessively showy and long at just under three hours.

In 1941, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] made a [[sequel]] entitled ''[[Ziegfeld Girl (film)|Ziegfeld Girl]]'', starring [[James Stewart]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Hedy Lamarr]], and [[Lana Turner]], which recycled some film from ''The Great Ziegfeld''. In 1946, MGM made another sequel, [[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|''Ziegfeld Follies'']] by [[Vincente Minelli]].

The son of a highly respected music professor, [[Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr.|Florenz "Flo" Ziegfeld, Jr.]] ([[William Powell]]) yearns to make his mark in show business. He begins by promoting [[Eugen Sandow]] ([[Nat Pendleton]]), the "world's strongest man", at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 Chicago World's Fair]], overcoming the competition of rival Billings ([[Frank Morgan]]) and his popular attraction, belly dancer [[Little Egypt (dancer)#Farida Mazar Spyropoulos|Little Egypt]], with savvy marketing (allowing women to feel Sandow's muscles).

Ziegfeld returns to his father and young Mary Lou at the [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig]], and departs to [[San Francisco]], where he and Sandow are deemed a fraud for putting on a show in which Sandow faces a lion who falls asleep as soon as it is let out of the cage. Flo travels to England on an ocean liner, where he runs into Billings again who is laughing at a newspaper article denouncing him as a fraud. Flo discovers that Billings is on his way to sign a contract with beautiful French star, [[Anna Held]] ([[Luise Rainer]]). Despite losing all his money gambling at [[Monte Carlo]], Flo charms Anna into signing with him instead, pretending that he doesn't know Billings. Anna twice almost sends him away for his rudeness and for being broke, before revealing that she appreciates his honesty. Ziegfeld promises to give her "more publicity than she ever dreams of" and to feature her alongside America's most prominent theatrical performers.

[[File:Ray Bolger in The Great Ziegfeld trailer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ray Bolger]]]]
At first, Anna's performance at the [[Herald Square Theatre]] is not a success. However, Flo manages to generate publicity by sending 20 gallons of milk to Anna every day for a fictitious milk bath beauty treatment, then refusing to pay the bill. The newspaper stories soon bring the curious to pack his theater, and Ziegfeld introduces eight new performers to back her. Viewers watching her comment on how the milk must make her skin beautiful and the show is a major success. Flo sends Anna flowers and jewelry and a note saying "you were magnificent my wife", and she agrees to marry him, flaunting her new diamonds to her fellow performers. 

However, one success is not enough for the showman. He has an idea for an entirely new kind of show featuring a bevy of blondes and brunettes, one that will "glorify" the American girl. The new show, the ''Ziegfeld Follies'', an opulent production filled with beautiful women and highly extravagant costumes and sets, is a smash hit, and is followed by more versions of the Follies. Ziegfeld tries to make a star out of Audrey Dane ([[Virginia Bruce]]) who is plagued with [[alcoholism]] and lures [[Fanny Brice]] (playing herself) away from [[vaudeville]], showering both with lavish gifts. He gives stagehand [[Ray Bolger]] (also playing himself) his break as well. Mary Lou, now a young woman, visits Ziegfield who doesn't recognize her initially, and hires her as a dancer. The new production upsets Anna, who realizes that Flo's world does not revolve around just her, and she becomes envious of the attention he pays to Audrey. She divorces him after walking in on Flo and a drunk Audrey at the wrong moment. Audrey walks out on Flo and the show after an angry confrontation. Broke, Flo borrows money from Billings for a third time for the new show. Flo meets the red-headed [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] star [[Billie Burke]] ([[Myrna Loy]]) and soon marries her. When she hears the news, a heartbroken Anna telephones Flo and pretends to be glad for him. Flo and Billie eventually have a daughter named Patricia.

Flo's new shows are a success, but after a while, the public's taste changes, and people begin to wonder if the times have not passed him by. After a string of negative reviews in the press, Flo overhears three men in a barber's shop saying that he'll "never produce another hit". Stung, he vows to have ''four'' hits on Broadway at the same time. He achieves his goal, with the hits ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927), ''[[Rio Rita (musical)|Rio Rita]]'' (1927), ''[[Whoopee!]]'' (1928), and ''[[The Three Musketeers (musical)|The Three Muskateers]]'', and invests over $1 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1929}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) of his winnings in the stock market. However, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of 1929]] bankrupts him, forcing Billie to return to the stage. 

Shaken by the reversal of his financial fortunes and the growing popularity of movies over live stage shows, he becomes seriously ill. Billings pays him a friendly visit, and the two men agree to become partners in a new, even grander production of ''The Ziegfeld Follies''. But the reality is that both men are broke and Ziegfeld realizes this. In the final scene in his apartment overlooking the [[Ziegfeld Theatre]], in a half-delirium, he recalls scenes from several of his hits, exclaiming, "I've got to have more steps, higher, higher", before slumping over dead in his chair.

==Production==
Ziegfeld's widow, [[Billie Burke]], was keen to pay off Ziegfeld's debts without filing for bankruptcy, and sold the rights to a biopic of him to [[Universal Pictures]] in late 1933. As a result, the film went into the pre-production phase in January 1934.{{sfn|Bryant|2006|p=105}} Macguire had initially proposed the biographical film to them in the form of a "filmusical entertainment" set in a "theatrical tradition" and William Powell was cast as Ziegfeld. However, by February 1935, Macguire had fallen into disagreement with Universal over financial problems at the studio,{{sfn|Bryant|2006|p=105}} and the entire production, including some already constructed sets and musical arrangements, were sold to MGM for US$300,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|300000|1935}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). As part of the deal however, Universal retained the services of Powell for the classic screwball comedy ''[[My Man Godfrey]]'', which was released the same year as ''The Great Ziegfeld''.{{sfn|Bryant|2006|p=105}}{{sfn|Green|1999|p=54}}

The film was shot at MGM Studios in [[Culver City, California]] mostly in the latter half of 1935 under a budget of US$1,500,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1500000|1935}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), produced by [[Hunt Stromberg]].{{sfn|Green|1999|p=54}}<ref name=Media>{{Cite news|url=http://variety.com/1936/film/reviews/the-great-ziegfeld-2-1200411276/|title=Review: <U+201C>The Great Ziegfeld<U+201D> Variety Media, LLC|date=15 April 1936|accessdate=19 August 2013|publisher=Variety Media L.L.C}}</ref> The cost exceeded US$2 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000000|1935}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) by the end of the production in early 1936,<ref>Hanie, Jonathan, ''Great Ziegfeld - Mesmerizing Best Picture of 1936'', ''Orlando Movie Examiner'', Retrieved on 25 August 2013</ref> exorbitant for the period, and it was MGM's most expensive film to date after ''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben Hur]]'' (1925).{{Sfn|Bryant|2006|p=105}} The principal cinematography was shot by [[Oliver T.

Gerstad]] is credited for the Hoctor Ballet.<ref name=Media/> 

In the advertising for the film, MGM boasted of the film's ostentatious nature, bragging that it was "SO BIG that only MGM could handle it", with its "countless beauties, trained lions, ponies, dogs and other animals".{{Sfn|Leider|2011|p=177}} [[Busby Berkely]], who had led [[Warner Brothers]] to become the leading producer of musicals in Hollywood in the 1930s, was a major influence on the producers which his "glamorous, excessive 1930s cinematic musical numbers".{{Sfn|Mizejewski|1999|p=167}} The film also came at a time when producers had begun seeing the economic and cultural importance of the cinematic medium in comparison to theatre.{{Sfn|Mizejewski|1999|p=167}} ''Variety'' notes that the film producers were likely very concerned with the presentation of the film after production was wrapped up, and that the long length of the film at 176 minutes was understandable in that they probably "wanted to preserve as much footage as possible".<ref name=Media/> [[William S. Gray]] was responsible for the editing of the film.<ref name=Media/> Over a thousand people were employed in the production, and ''The Great Ziegfeld'' required 16 reels of film after the cutting.{{Sfn|Leider|2011|p=178}} 

===Screenplay===
[[File:ZigfeldFollies1912.jpg|thumb|left|Poster from a 1912 theatrical production of the Ziegfeld Follies]]
The screenplay by [[William Anthony McGuire]] was a "novelty" to many audiences who were familiar with the theatrical Broadway shows of the follies.{{sfn|Hischak|2008|pp=304-305}} The script, although fictionalized with embellishments needed for the motion picture,{{sfn|Hanson|2011|p=179}} did show some accuracies in the life of Ziegfeld.<ref name=Media>{{Cite news|url=http://variety.com/1936/film/reviews/the-great-ziegfeld-2-1200411276/|title=Review: <U+201C>The Great Ziegfeld<U+201D> Variety Media, LLC|date=15 April 1936|accessdate=19 August 2013|publisher=Variety Media L.L.C}}</ref> Frank S. Nugent of ''The New York Times'' said of the script: "What William Anthony McGuire has attempted in his screen play, and with general success, is to encompass not merely the fantastic personal history of Ziegfeld but the cross-sectional story of the development of the Follies, the Midnight Frolic on the New Amsterdam Roof and the other theatrical enterprises floated under the Glorifier's aegis during a span of about forty years. The two biographies<U+2014>of the man and of his creations<U+2014>are, naturally, inseparable; but both have been told with such wealth of detail and circumstance (real and imaginative) that even the three-hour film narrative is fragmentary and, in some places, confused."<ref name="NYT">{{cite web|author=Nugent, Frank S.|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9802E4DE133FEE3BBC4153DFB266838D629EDE|title=The Great Ziegfeld (1936)|publisher= ''The New York Times'' |date=9 April 1936|accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> 

Although it has some accuracies, ''The Great Ziegfeld'' takes many key liberties with Ziegfeld's life and the history of the ''Follies'', resulting in many inaccuracies.<ref name=Turner/> The earlier scenes with Sandow, the milk bath advertising scenario, and many other sequences including several of the dramatic ups and downs of the film were fictional.<ref name=Media/> [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' was never featured in the ''Follies'', and the number "A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody" was written for the 1919 ''Follies'',{{sfn|Merwe|2009|p=138}} not the first edition of the revue, as shown in the film. Ray Bolger was never cast in a "Follies" show,<ref name=Turner/> and although she was born in the U.S, Billie Burke grew up in England and spoke with a "Mid-Atlantic" accent throughout her life; Loy who portrays her clearly has an American accent in the film.{{sfn|Hayter-Menzies|2009|p=64}} In the film, the last few lines of the song "[[Ol' Man River]]" (from ''Show Boat'') are sung by what sounds like a tenor, while the song was intended for bass [[Paul Robeson]] and sung in the original production by bass-baritone [[Jules Bledsoe]].{{Sfn|Boyle|2005|p=253}} Further, the screenplay also gives the impression that the successful original production of ''[[Show Boat]]'', which Ziegfeld produced, closed because of the [[Great Depression]]. In fact ''Show Boat'' ended its original 1927 run in the spring of 1929 and the stock market crash did not occur until October of that year. It was the 1932 revival of the show (also produced by Ziegfeld shortly before his death), not the original production, that was affected by the Depression.{{sfn|Jones|2003|p=82}}  Also, in the final scene where Ziegfeld dies in his room at the Hotel Warwick (not mentioned) which stood in front of the Ziegfeld Theatre, Ziegfeld actually died in Los Angeles and had not even spent his last years in New York.{{Sfn|Leider|2011|p=180}} However, McGuire did capture a number of Ziegfeld's traits, such as sending telegrams to people even in close proximity, his belief that elephants were a symbol of good luck, his exquisite taste in costumes and design, and perfectionism over his productions, especially lighting and rostrum pedestaling.<ref name=Media/> McGuire's script, now in the Henry E. Huntington Library, [[San Marino, California]], is dated to 21 September 1935, probably the date when it was finalized.{{sfn|Smyth|2006|p=544}}

===Casting===
[[File:Marilyn Miller.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marilyn Miller]] who was rejected after exorbitant demands from the film producers, threatening to sue if her name was even mentioned in the film]]
Initially, the main cast proposed for the film included [[Marilyn Miller]], [[Gilda Grey]], [[Ann Pennigton]], and [[Leon Errol]].{{sfn|Green|1999|p=54}} Featured in the film are [[William Powell]] as Ziegfeld, [[Myrna Loy]] as [[Billie Burke]], [[Luise Rainer]] as [[Anna Held]], [[Nat Pendleton]] as [[Eugen Sandow]], and [[Frank Morgan]]. Powell admitted to being "amazed" with the film after viewing it and was very grateful at having had the privilege to portray Ziegfeld, considering it to be a very important moment in his career. He said, "After seeing this film I can see that most of the characters I have played before were contrived. They had no 'folks', as the character of Ziegfeld had in this picture. Their father was a pen and their mother was a bottle of ink. Here was a character with flesh, blood and sinews. I felt for the first time in my acting career I had tried the full measure of a man, regardless of my shortcomings in playing him."{{Sfn|Bryant|2006|p=108}}

Many of the performers of the earlier Broadway version of the Ziegfeld Follies were cast in the film as themselves, including [[Fanny Brice]] and [[Harriet Hoctor]], the ballet dancer and contortionist.<ref name=Kindler>{{Cite web|url=http://thekindleroscarchronicles.com/2012/03/21/9-the-great-ziegfeld-1936/|title=The Kindler Oscar Chronicles|work=9.

Nat Pendleton, a freestyle wrestler who had won the silver medal at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]] and had appeared alongside Powell in ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]'' (1934), was cast as the [[Strongman (circus)|circus strongman]] Eugen Sandow.
[[File:Billie Burke in Small Town Girl trailer.jpg|thumb|left|[[Billie Burke]] worked as a technical consultant on the film]]
Billie Burke objected to her role being cast with another actress (Myrna Loy) since she was also an actress under contract to the studio and could play herself, but the producers concluded that at that point she was not a big enough star to play herself in ''The Great Ziegfeld''. According to Emily W. Leider however, Burke was not keen on playing her younger self and mentions that Billie Burke's biographer stated that [[Miriam Hopkins]] would have been her first choice to play her part, not Loy.{{Sfn|Leider|2011|p=178}} Burke herself worked as technical consultant, and although she did not object to Marilyn Miller performing a number, she was influential in the studio's refusal to give her the higher billing and salary she had demanded, which led to Miller walking away from the film.{{Sfn|Parish|1992|p=221}}{{sfn|Hanson|2011|p=179}} Both Miller and [[Lillian Lorraine]] threatened legal action if so much as their names were mentioned in the film.{{sfn|Hanson|2011|p=179}} Thus Miller's character was renamed "Sally Manners", and Lorraine's character was renamed "Audrey Dane" (played by [[Virginia Bruce]]). In real life, Ziegfeld had reportedly been obsessed with Miller, and was involved in numerous sex scandals.{{Sfn|Mizejewski|1999|p=164}} In 1922 Miller had given an interview in which she accused him of "making love to chorus girls" and sending her a diamond ring as "big as her hand";{{Sfn|Mizejewski|1999|p=164}} this essence of Ziegfeld's character is captured in the film. Incidentally, Miller died from toxicity complications after surgery just before the release of the film on April 7, 1936,{{Sfn|Vogel|p=126}} which led one reviewer writing in ''[[Liberty (magazine)|Liberty]]'' to denounce an urban legend which had arisen surrounding the timing of her death, saying, "It<U+2019>s not true that Marilyn Miller died of a broken heart at not getting the lead in this." Another myth surrounding her untimely death at the age of 37 is that she had contracted [[syphilis]].{{Sfn|Vogel|p=126}}

Frank Morgan, a stage and film character actor, played the role of promoter Billings in the film.{{sfn|Hischak|2008|p=506}} [[Dennis Morgan]], in an uncredited role, performs in "[[A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody]]" (dubbed by [[Allan Jones (actor)|Allan Jones]]). [[Pat Nixon]], the future wife of [[Richard Nixon]] and [[First Lady of the United States]], was an [[Extra (acting)|extra]] in the film.{{sfn|Cornelius|2008|p=45}} [[Will Rogers]] had intended starring but was killed in a plane crash in August 1935. He was played by stand-in A. A. Trimble.{{Sfn|Leider|2011|p=178}}{{sfn|Parish|1981|p=90}}

===Costumes===
The extravagant costumes, which even Ziegfeld initially considered too flamboyant, were designed by [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]],{{Sfn|Gutner|2001}} who had worked with many of the greatest actresses of the period including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]], [[Jeanette MacDonald]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Joan Crawford]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/review?oid=oid%3A82239 |title=Screens: Review <U+2013> Gowns by Adrian |publisher=''The Austin Chronicle'' |accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> and later designed for films such as ''[[Marie Antoinette (1938 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' (1938), ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939), and  ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939). Howard Gutner documents that due to MGM's wealth and the high budget, Adrian was able to indulge in "sheer lavishness" in making the costumes, surpassing anything he had done previously.{{Sfn|Gutner|2001}} It took 250 tailors and seamstresses six months to sew the costumes that Adrian had designed for the film, using {{convert|50|lb}} of silver sequins and {{convert|12|yd|m}} of white [[ostrich]] plumes.{{Sfn|Leider|2011|p=177}} The costumes worn by women in the film are diverse, varying from "puffy hooped skirts to catlike leopards" to "layers of tulle and chiffron", with the men mostly wearing black [[tuxedo]]s.{{Sfn|Mizejewski|1999|p=167}}

Robert Z. Leonard, a film director who specialized in melodrama and musicals, anchored the music for the film, working with [[Walter Donaldson]], [[Irving Berlin]], and lyricist [[Harold Adamson]].{{sfn|Hischak|2008|p=427}} The extravagant dances and ensemble sequences were choreographed by Seymour Felix and Harold Adamson, including the song sequence of "A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody" (it was Irving Berlin<U+2019>s 13th annual edition in 1919). The "A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody" set, known as the "Wedding Cake", involved several weeks of shooting time and was reported to have cost US$220,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|220000|1936}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).{{Sfn|Bryant|2006|p=108}}{{sfn|Green|1999|p=54}} As many as 180 performers were involved in the scenes which included singers, dancers and musicians.{{Sfn|Bryant|2006|p=108}} The sequence presented started with the "[[Rhapsody in Blue]]" and concluded with Virginia Bruce descending from the volute as it rotated, a satin curtain being lowered from the top enclosing the volute.{{sfn|Green|1999|p=54}}{{sfn|Hischak|2008|pp=304-305}} The Mauritians, made of rayon silk, measured {{convert|4300|yd|m}}.<ref name=Turner>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/186/The-Great-Ziegfeld/notes.html|title=The Great Ziegfeld(1936): TCMDb Archive Materials|date=|accessdate=25 August 2013|publisher=Turner Classic Movies (TCM)}}</ref>{{Sfn|Bryant|2006|p=108}} Sheldon Hall and Stephen Neale note the theatrical sense that the cinematographers achieved through shooting the sequence in virtually a single take.{{sfn|Hall|Neale|2010|p=106}} They mention that "the camera traverses an enormous platform set contained within a curtained proscenium (also enormous)", and that the "set itself revolves to meet the camera, rather than the camera entering the space of the set."{{sfn|Hall|Neale|2010|p=106}} Linda Mizejewski, author of a book on the Ziegfield girls, argues that the Pretty Girl sequence is more than just about being showy; it is symbolic of womanhood which "powerfully visualizes women as the raw material for male aesthetic vision and design".{{Sfn|Mizejewski|1999|p=168}} In the film she believes that womanhood is defined by the "young, white, blond and slender" female, which in the sequence are "delineated as the fluffy, artificial tiers of costuming and staging".{{Sfn|Mizejewski|1999|p=168}}

The Harriet Hoctor ballet music was scored by [[Con Conrad]] to lyrics written by [[Herb Magidson]]. The circus ballet was an adaptation from the old Ziegfeld stage shows.{{sfn|Green|1999|p=54}}<ref name="NYT"/> ''Variety'' called the Hoctor ballet "in itself intricate with its maneuverings of six Russian wolfhounds in terp formations",<ref name=Media/> and said that the "A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody" sequence in the film is a "nifty Berlin tune [which] becomes the fulcrum for one of [[Frank Skinner (composer)|Frank Skinner]]'s best arrangements as [[Arthur Lange]] batons the crescendos into a mad, glittering potpourri of [[Saint-Saens]] and [[Gershwin]], [[Strauss]] and [[Verdi]], beautifully blended against the Berlinesque background. It<U+2019>s a scenic flash which makes the auditor wonder 'What can they do to follow that?' meaning in this or future film production."<ref name=Media/> Juan Antonio Ram<U+00ED>rez refers to the wedding cake as a "famous spiral column", citing it as one of the best known pieces of mobile architecture in film, but notes that in design the cake was not exclusive to ''The Great Ziegfeld'', explaining that a wedding cake, albeit less flamboyant, had appeared in previous films such ''[[The King of Jazz]]'' (1930), ''[[The Kid from Spain]]'' (1932), ''[[Top Hat]]'' (1935), and ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1935).{{Sfn|Ram<U+00ED>rez|2004|p=202}} Ram<U+00ED>rez describes the film's ''[[Mise en sc<U+00E8>ne]]'' as representing "the last word in flashy vulgarity, Surrealist kitsch, or perhaps both at once".{{Sfn|Ram<U+00ED>rez|2004|p=202}}

===Aftermath===
Farida Mahzar filed a law suit against the film makers shortly before her death, claiming that they "presented Little Egypt as a lewd character".{{Sfn|AlZayer|2010|p=22}} 14 witnesses who had seen the act at the 1893 Chicago World Fair supported this, although the law suit was dropped after Mahzar died from a heart attack.{{Sfn|AlZayer|2010|p=22}} Burke caused much controversy and upset among many of Ziegfeld's friends and colleagues when she sold the rights to a production on Broadway, the ''Ziegfeld Follies'', also starring Fanny Brice, at the time the film was released in 1936, due to the fact that the show was produced by the Shubert brothers, whom Ziegfeld detested. Worse still for his associates, was that the show was a bigger success than Ziegfeld's last production of the Follies in 1931. The ''Ziegfeld Follies'' under [[Vincente Minelli]] was initially performed in December 1935, before making its Broadway debut on January 30, 1936.{{Sfn|Griffin|2010|p=39-40}} It was performed in [[Boston]] and [[Philadelphia]] until the production was postponed after Brice collapsed on stage with exhaustion.{{Sfn|Griffin|2010|p=39-40}} When it reopened on Broadway in September 1936, five months after the release of the film, it was retitled ''The New Ziegfeld Follies of 1936<U+2013>1937'', and was revamped considerably, with changes to the show's humor.{{Sfn|Griffin|2010|p=39-40}}

In 1941, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] made a [[sequel]] entitled ''[[Ziegfeld Girl (film)|Ziegfeld Girl]]'', starring [[James Stewart]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Hedy Lamarr]], and [[Lana Turner]], which recycled some film from ''The Great Ziegfeld''. In 1946, MGM made another sequel, [[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|''Ziegfeld Follies'']], directed by Vincente Minelli, director of the stage show.{{Sfn|Mizejewski|1999|p=138}}

==Reception==
[[File:Cathay Circle Theater.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Carthay Circle Theatre]], pictured a year after ''The Great Ziegfeld'' was released]]
===Critical response at the time of release===
The film, which premiered in [[Los Angeles]] at the [[Carthay Circle Theatre]], was the first musical film in history for which one of its cast members won an [[Academy Award]]  - [[Luise Rainer]] received the Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Ziegfeld's first wife, [[Anna Held]]. The film, the pride of MGM at a time when [[Warner Brothers]] and [[RKO Pictures]] were the leading studios in Hollywood for musical production, was a major commercial and critical success and one of the most successful films of the 1930s, grossing US$4,673,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4673000|1936}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) worldwide at the box office.{{Sfn|Leider|2011|p=177}} It was acclaimed upon release as the greatest musical biography to be made in Hollywood and still remains a standard in musical film making.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2505910485.html|title=The Great Ziegfeld|publisher=VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever|date=1 January 2008|accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> At just short of three hours, ''The Great Ziegfeld'' was also the longest film of the time.<ref name=Media/> TCM has acclaimed the "A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody" sequence as "the most famous musical numbers ever filmed".<ref name=Turner/> Thomas S. Hischak has said that the film has rarely been topped for pure showmanship and glamor, {{sfn|Hischak|2008|pp=304-305}} and ''Variety'' viewed the film as an "outstanding picture", a "symbol of a tradition of show business". <ref name=Media/> ''Variety'' praised the performances of the cast, remarking that as Ziegfeld, William Powell "endows the impersonation with all the qualities of a great entrepreneur and sentimentalist without sacrificing the shades and moods called for" and noting that Luise Rainer is "tops of the femmes with her vivacious Anna Held".<ref name=Media/> Stanley Green cited the ''The Great Ziegfeld'' as "the first of a number of elaborate show-business screen biographies".{{sfn|Green|1999|p=54}}  Otis Ferguson, writing for ''New Republic'' magazine, remarked that the "musical numbers seem as irresistible as Ziegfeld himself".{{sfn|Dunne||p=128}} The ''New York American'' said that the film is "pretty nearly everything such an extravaganza should be", with "romance and reality, song and dance, gaiety and beauty, pathos and bathos".{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|1992|p=275}} ''Time'' magazine said "Pretentious, packed with hokum and as richly sentimental as an Irving Berlin lyric, it is, as such, top-notch entertainment."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,848521,00.html|title=Cinema: The New Pictures: Apr. 20, 1936|publisher=''Time''|date=20 April 1936|accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> A reviewer for the ''Spokane Chronicle'' praised the film for its superb acting, writing that "[e]ven the great producer [Ziegfield] would have been unable to produce scenes of magnitude and splendor that are given as part of the picture telling his life."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nMtXAAAAIBAJ&sjid=H_UDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7456,2717746 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |date=October 8, 2013 |pages=7- |title=Great Ziegfield Scores at Fox}}</ref> Frank S. Nugent of ''The New York Times'' was also highly praising of the film, noting that it had "more stars than there are in the heavens" and remarking that "the picture achieves its best moments in the larger sequences devoted to the Girls <U+2014> ballet, chorus and show. At least one of these spectacular numbers, filmed to the music of Irving Berlin's "A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody," with overtones of "Rhapsody in Blue," never has been equaled on the musical comedy stage or screen."<ref name="NYT"/> Both ''The New York Times'' and ''Film Daily'' rated the film in the "Ten Best" of the year.<ref name=Turner/>

However, not all critics were as enthusiastic about the film; Graham Green of the British ''Spectator'' called it a "huge inflated glass-blown object and criticized its length, comparing it to the feat of a flagpole sitter.{{Sfn|Leider|2011|p=177}} A number of critics, although praising of the film in general, felt that Myrna Loy, who appears rather late on in the film, gave a lackluster performance as Billie Burke.{{Sfn|Leider|2011|p=178}} Nugent said that "Miss Loy is a stately Bille Burke, and somewhat lacking, we fear, in Miss Burke's effervescence and gaiety", and [[Cecilia Agner]] thought she came across as "stilted, like her rigidly waxed and set blonde wig". [[Harrison Carroll]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Herald Express]]'', however, sympathized with the difficulty of her role in portraying a prominent living actress, confessing that he was pleased that Loy didn't attempt to imitate Burke's mannerisms.{{Sfn|Leider|2011|p=179}} Emily W. Leider believes that any of her character flaws were due to a "mushy" script, rather than her as an actress.{{Sfn|Leider|2011|p=179}}

===Critical re-evaluation===
Although the film is still viewed as a symbol of glamor and excess during the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age of Hollywood]], 
today the film has more of a mixed reception, with many critics believing that the film relies on its (now-dated) extravagance and is too long; [[Christopher Null]] stated that ''The Great Ziegfeld'' is a "textbook case of how a film can lose its appeal over the years". Since its release the film has been criticized in particular for being unnecessarily lengthy and its overacting (particularly by Rainer), and is occasionally cited as a "prime example of the Academy's fallibility" in a year when other critically acclaimed pictures such as ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' were released, which some argue was more deserving of Best Picture.{{Sfn|Leider|2011|p=179}}{{Sfn|Bryant|2006|p=107}} The consensus today on the review site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] is that although the "biopic is undeniably stylish", it "loses points for excessive length, an overreliance on clich<U+00E9>s, and historical inaccuracies", and has a 61% fresh rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/great_ziegfeld/|title=The Great Ziegfeld (1936)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> Emily W. Leider claims the film to be "more remarkable for its <U+201C>legs and tinsel<U+201D> extravagance than for its excellence."{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=177}} [[David Parkinson]] of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and concluded that it "Drags in places and doesn't even try for a true-to-life portrait of the great theatre entrepreneur but it's shiny and big spectacle with impressive choreography."<ref>{{cite web|author=Parkinson, David|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=133771|title=The Great Ziegfeld |publisher=''Empire''|accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> Dave Kehr of the ''Chicago Reader'' called it "amazingly dull, even with William Powell in the lead and guest appearances by the likes of Ray Bolger and Fanny Brice."<ref>{{cite web|author=Kehr, Dave|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-great-ziegfeld/Film?oid=1060544|title=The Great Ziegfeld|publisher=''The Chiacgo Reader''|accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> [[Emanuel Levy]] gave it a C grade and stated that it was an "overlong and overblown but ultimately mediocre as a musical movie and as a biopic of the legendary showman."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emanuellevy.com/review/great-ziegfeld-the-1936-4/|title=Great Ziegfeld, The (1936) |publisher=Emanuel Levy|accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> [[James Berardinelli]] awarded it 2.5 out of 4 stars and stated that "although some of the production's technical aspects remain impressive, the dramatic elements come across as trite and many of the musical numbers are dated", but said that it was a "reasonably competent - albeit "airbrushed" - presentation of the main character's life."<ref>{{cite web|author=Beradinelli, James|url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=2023|title=Great Ziegfeld, The|publisher=''Reel Views''|date=20 May 2010|accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref>

===Accolades===
The seven [[Academy Award]] nominations were announced on February 7, 1937, and on March 4, 1937, ''The Great Ziegfeld'' movie won three Oscars at the [[9th Academy Awards]]: <ref name= NYTAwards>{{cite web |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/20813/The-Great-Ziegfeld/awards |title=The Great Ziegfeld (1936) Awards |publisher=''The New York Times'' |accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref><ref name= Oscar>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/9th.html|title=The 9th Academy Awards (1937)|date=4 March 1937|accessdate=19 August 2013|publisher=Oscar Organization}}</ref>
