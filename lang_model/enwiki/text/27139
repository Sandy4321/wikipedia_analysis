<!--NB<U+2014>THE DATES IN THIS ARTICLE ARE NON-AUTOFORMATTED-->The '''Battle of Concepci<U+00F3>n''' was fought on October&nbsp;28, 1835 between Mexican troops under Colonel [[Domingo Ugartechea]] and [[Texian]] insurgents led by [[James Bowie]] and [[James Fannin]].  The 30-minute engagement, which historian J.R. Edmondson describes as "the first major engagement of the [[Texas Revolution]]",<ref name=edmondson224/> occurred on the grounds of [[Mission Concepci<U+00F3>n]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} from [[San Antonio, TX|San Antonio de Bexar]].

On October&nbsp;13, the newly created [[Texian Army]] under [[Stephen F. Austin]] had marched towards Bexar, where General [[Mart<U+00ED>n Perfecto de Cos]] commanded the remaining Mexican soldiers in the [[Mexican Texas|Texas]].  On October&nbsp;27, Austin sent Bowie and Fannin, with 90&nbsp;soldiers, to find a defensible spot near Bexar for the Texian Army to rest.  After choosing a site near Mission Concepci<U+00F3>n, the scouting party camped for the night and sent a courier to notify Austin.  After learning that the Texian Army was divided, Cos sent Ugartechea with 275 soldiers to attack the Texians camped at Concepci<U+00F3>n.  The Texians took cover in a horseshoe-shaped gully; their good defensive position, longer firing range, and better ammunition helped them to repel several Mexican attacks, and the Mexican soldiers retreated just 30 minutes before the remainder of the Texian Army arrived.  Historians estimate that between 14 and 76 Mexican soldiers were killed, while only one Texian soldier died.

==Background==
{{See|Texas Revolution|Siege of Bexar}}
Determined to put a decisive end to Mexican control over [[Mexican Texas|Texas]], the newly organized [[Texian Army]] began marching towards [[San Antonio, TX|San Antonio de Bexar]] on October&nbsp;13, 1835 .<ref name=barr6>Barr (1990), p. 6.</ref>  Days earlier, General [[Mart<U+00ED>n Perfecto de Cos]], brother-in-law of Mexican president [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]], had arrived in Bexar to take command of all the Mexican forces in Texas.<ref name=barr12>Barr (1990), p. 12.</ref>  By October&nbsp;20 the Texians&mdash;led by [[Stephen F. Austin]], the first [[empresario]] to bring English-speaking settlers to Texas<ref group="Note">[[Mexican Texas]] included the land north of the [[Medina River|Medina]] and the [[Nueces River]]s, {{convert|100|mi|km|0}} northeast of the [[Rio Grande]], west of [[San Antonio de Bexar]], and east of the [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine River]].  According to Manchaca's ''Recovering History, Constructing Race: The Indian, Black, and White Roots of Mexican Americans'', by 1834 an estimated 30,000 English-speakers lived in Texas, compared with only 7,800 of Spanish heritage.</ref>&mdash;had reached [[Salado Creek]] and initiated a [[siege of Bexar]].<ref name=barr15>Barr (1990), p. 15.</ref><ref name=hardin53>Hardin (1994), p. 53.</ref>  To keep the Texians from examining Mexican defensive measures, Mexican troops attempted to restrict access to and from the city.  Despite those efforts, several people were able to leave their homes and join the Texians.<ref name=barr17>Barr (1990), p. 17.</ref>  Among those was [[James Bowie]], who was well-known for his fighting prowess; stories of his exploits in the [[Sandbar Fight]] and his search for the lost San Saba mine had been widely reported.<ref name=hardin29>Hardin (1994), p. 29.</ref>

On October&nbsp;22, Austin named Bowie a colonel and gave him joint command of the 1st Battalion with Captain [[James W. Fannin]].<ref name=hardin29/><ref name=barr18>Barr (1990),p. 18.</ref>  Before nightfall the 1st Battalion began a reconnaissance mission to evaluate [[San Antonio Missions National Historical Park|the former missions around San Antonio]] as potential campsites. Locals familiar with the area, [[Juan Seguin]] and his Texians, would guide the men along the river.<ref name=hardin29>Hardin (1994), p. 29.</ref> After investigating three of the missions, Bowie and Fannin selected [[Mission San Francisco de la Espada]] as the most promising campsite.<ref name=barr19>Barr (1990), p. 19.</ref>  The rest of the Texian Army joined them there early on October&nbsp;27.  Eager to move closer to Bexar, Austin immediately sent Bowie and Fannin to find a good defensive spot for the army to rest that night.<ref name=barr22>Barr (1990), p. 22.</ref>

==Prelude==
Bowie and Fannin were accompanied by ninety soldiers, divided into four companies led by Captains [[Andrew Briscoe]], Robert Coleman, Michael Goheen, and Valentine Bennet.<ref name=barr22/><ref name=todish23>Todish et al. (1998), p. 23.</ref>   The group took a northerly route, following the [[San Antonio River]] past Missions [[Mission San Juan Capistrano (Texas)|San Juan]] and [[Mission San Jos<U+00E9> y San Miguel de Aguayo|San Jos<U+00E9>]].<ref name=barr22/>  Along the way they encountered a small party of Mexican scouts, who retreated to Bexar after a brief skirmish.<ref name=barr22/>

[[Image:Mission-Concepcion.jpg|thumb|right|Mission Concepci<U+00F3>n]]
Approximately {{convert|2|mi|km}} from San Antonio de Bexar and {{convert|6|mi|km}} from the Texian camp at Espada,<ref name=barr23>Barr (1990), p. 23.</ref> the Texian scouting party stopped at [[Mission Concepci<U+00F3>n]].<ref name=hardin30>Hardin (1994), p. 30.</ref> Five hundred yards (460&nbsp;m) west of the mission, the San Antonio River curved in a small horseshoe shape, with the two sides of the river's curve approximately {{convert|100|yd|m}} apart.<ref name=hardin30/>  According to historian Alwyn Barr, "trees shaded both sides of the broad riverbottom which lay about six feet below the level of the rolling praire{{sic|?}} nearby".<ref name=barr22/>  Rather than return immediately to Austin, as their orders specified, Bowie and Fannin instead sent a courier to bring Austin directions to Concepci<U+00F3>n.  The next day, an angry Austin issued a statement threatening officers who chose not to follow orders with [[court-martial]].<ref name=barr22/>

The Texian scouting party divided into two camps. Fannin supervised 49&nbsp;men at the south part of the horseshoe bend,<ref name=edmondson221>Edmondson (2000), p. 221.</ref> while Bowie and the remaining men camped at the northern part of the bend.<ref name=barr22/> Any Mexican force coming from the north would be caught in their cross-fire.<ref name=edmondson221/>  Pickets were stationed around the area and in the mission tower, which offered greater visibility.<ref name=barr22/> As they settled down for the evening, the Texians were surprised to see a Mexican cannonball, fired from one of the church towers in Bexar, hit just beyond their camp.<ref name=barr22/>  Many of the Texian soldiers believed that a priest from the mission had informed the Mexican Army of their position.<ref name=hardin30/>

==Battle==
Hoping to neutralize the Texian force at Concepci<U+00F3>n before the remainder of the Texian Army arrived, Cos ordered Colonel [[Domingo Ugartechea]] to lead an early-morning assault on October&nbsp;28.  At 6:00 a.m., Ugartechea left Bexar with 275 Mexican soldiers and 2&nbsp;cannon.<ref name=barr23/><ref name=barr24/>  Heavy fog delayed their approach, and the Mexican soldiers did not reach Concepci<U+00F3>n until 7:30 or 8:00 a.m.<ref name=barr24>Barr (1990), p. 24.</ref>   A Mexican cavalry scout fired at Texian picket [[Henry Karnes]]; after returning fire, Karnes ran back to his company, frustrated because, as he put it, "Boys, the scoundrels have shot off my powder horn".<ref name = edmondson222/> The Texians took refuge in the gully, firing from its edge before dropping the {{convert|6|ft|m}} down to the river level to reload.<ref name=todish23/>  As the remaining Texian sentries hurried to join the main body of Texian soldiers,<ref name=hardin30/>  Pen Jarvis was struck by a Mexican bullet and fell down the river bank.  The bullet hit a knife Jarvis had slipped through the front of his belt, and he suffered only bruises.<ref name=barr24/><ref name=edmondson222/>
[[Image:Jimbowie.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Colonel [[James Bowie]] led the [[Texian]] forces during the Battle of Concepci<U+00F3>n.]]
The Texian position was surrounded by trees, leaving the Mexican cavalry no room to maneuver.  The 200 members of the cavalry remained on the west bank of the river, behind the Texians, to foil any escape attempts.<ref name=edmondson222>Edmondson (2000), p. 222.</ref> Lieutenant Colonel Jos<U+00E9> Maria Mendosa brought the Mexican infantry and artillery across the river to a position below that of the Texians.  In response, Texians trimmed undergrowth near their camp to provide better visibility and dug steps into the embankment so that they could more easily climb up to fire.  The two sides skirmished desultorily for two hours, until the fog began to lift.  At that point, 50&ndash;60 Mexican infantrymen crossed the prairie to surround the Texians.<ref name=barr24/>  Seeing their approach, Bowie shouted to his Texian forces, "Keep under cover, boys, and reserve your fire; we haven't a man to spare!"<ref name=barr24/>  At {{convert|300|yd|m}} from the Texian position, the Mexican infantry halted and [[Line (formation)|formed a line]] with the cannon in the middle.  They began firing as they advanced toward the Texian positions, to little effect.  For the most part, the Mexican volleys passed over the heads of the Texians.<ref name=barr24/>  According to Texian [[Noah Smithwick]], "grapeshot and canister thrashed through the pecan tees overhead, raining a shower of ripe nuts down on us, and I saw men picking them up and eating them with as little concern as if they were being shaken down by a norther."<ref name=hardin30/> In his official report to Austin, Bowie remarked that "The discharge from the enemy was one continued blaze of fire, whilst that from our lines, was more slowly delivered, but with good aim and deadly effect."<ref name=edmondson222/>  The Mexican infantry were assigned [[Brown Bess musket]]s, which had a maximum range of only {{convert|70|yd|m}}, compared to the {{convert|200|yd|m|adj=on}} effective range of the Texian long rifles.<ref name=hardin32/>  The Texians were short of ammunition,<ref name=hardin30/> however, and although Mexican ammunition was plentiful it was poor quality.  In several cases, Mexican musket balls bounced off Texian soldiers, causing little damage other than a bruise.<ref name=hardin32/>

When Mexican officers ordered a charge on the south bend held by Fannin, Bowie sent Coleman's company to help.  Most of the Texian reinforcements maneuvered to their new position from below the river bank, but several rose from cover and dashed across the prairie.<ref name=barr24/>  One of them, [[Richard Andrews (soldier)|Richard Andrews]], was hit in the side with [[grapeshot]]<ref name=barr25>Barr (1990), p. 25.</ref> and died several hours after the battle.<ref name=hardin34/>

As the reinforcements reached the southern part of the horseshoe, the Mexican infantry fell back, leaving the cannon within {{convert|100|yd|m}} of the Texians.  Texians redirected their fire to the cannoneers.<ref name=barr25/><ref name=hardin33/>  After three different sets of gunners were killed or wounded, the cannons were abandoned.<ref name=hardin32>Hardin (1994), p. 32.</ref>  The Mexican infantry attempted three attacks; all were repulsed.  As the Mexican buglers called for a retreat, the infantry fell back beyond Texian rifle range.  The Mexican cavalry was sent to retrieve wounded men and the cannon. As the cavalry approached, Bowie led a charge onto the prairie.<ref name=barr25/><ref name=hardin33>Hardin (1994), p. 33.</ref>  The Texians quickly captured the cannon and turned it on the fleeing Mexican soldiers.  Grapeshot killed one of the mule drivers, causing his caisson to go out of control and "careen[...] through the shattered Mexican ranks".<ref name=hardin33/>  The battle had lasted only 30&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=barr25/>

==Aftermath==
[[Image:JamesWFannin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Captain [[James W. Fannin]] was one of the commanders at the Battle of Concepci<U+00F3>n.]]
Austin had intended to reunite the two parts of his army early on October&nbsp;28, but the group camping at Mission Espada had delayed their departure to unsuccessfully pursue a company that had deserted.<ref name=barr25/> Lieutenant Colonel [[William Barret Travis]] and his company of cavalry rode ahead of the main body of the army.  When they reached Concepci<U+00F3>n, the Mexican Army was still visible in the distance.<ref name=edmondson223>Edmondson (2000), p. 223.</ref>  The small band of Texian cavalry pursued but the Mexican soldiers reached Bexar safely.<ref name=hardin34/>

Less than 30&nbsp;minutes after the battle ended, the rest of the Texian Army arrived.<ref name=barr25/>  Austin felt that the Mexican morale must be low after their defeat and wanted to proceed immediately to Bexar.  Bowie and other officers refused, as they believed Bexar was too heavily fortified.<ref name=barr25/>  The Texians searched the area for any Mexican equipment which had been abandoned during the retreat.  They found several boxes of [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]].  Complaining that the Mexican powder was "little better than pounded charcoal", the Texians emptied the cartridges but kept the bullets.<ref name=hardin34>Hardin (1994), p. 34.</ref>

That evening, Austin allowed a local priest and men from Bexar to retrieve the bodies of the Mexican soldiers who had died in battle.<ref name=barr26>Barr (1990), p. 26.</ref>  Barr estimated that at least 14 Mexican soldiers were killed, with an additional 39 wounded, several of whom died later.<ref name=barr26/>  Timothy Todish et al., in their book ''The Alamo Sourcebook'', estimated that 60 Mexican soldiers were killed,<ref name=todish23/> while historian Stephen Hardin claimed that 76&nbsp;Mexican soldiers died.<ref name=hardin34/>  The only Texian to die in battle was Andrews,<ref group="Note">[[Andrews County, Texas]] is named for Richard Andrews.</ref> and Jarvis was the only Texian classified as wounded.<ref name=barr26/>

This battle, which historian J.R. Edmondson describes as "the first major engagement of the Texas Revolution",<ref name=edmondson224>Edmondson (2000), p. 224.</ref> was the last offensive against the Texians that Cos would order.<ref name=barr27>Barr (1990), p. 27.</ref>   Barr attributed the Texian victory to "able leadership, a strong position, and greater firepower".<ref name=barr26/>  The Mexican cavalry was unable to fight effectively in the wooded, riverbottom terrain, and the weapons of the Mexican infantry had a much lower range than that of the Texians.<ref name=barr26/>  Although Barr continues that the battle "should have taught&nbsp;... lessons on Mexican courage and the value of a good defensive position",<ref name=barr60>Barr (1990), p. 60.</ref> Hardin believes that "the relative ease of the victory at Concepci<U+00F3>n instilled in the Texians a reliance on their long rifles and a contempt for their enemies".<ref name=hardin35>Hardin (1994), p. 35.</ref>  A soldier who later served under Fannin complained that Fannin's "former experience in fighting Mexicans [at Concepci<U+00F3>n] had led him to neglect to take such precautionary measures as were requisite", which may have contributed to his defeat at the [[Battle of Coleto]] in March 1836.<ref name=barr60/>
