'''Beirut''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Band (music)|band]] which was originally the solo musical project of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[New Mexico]] native '''Zachary Francis Condon''', and later expanded into a band.  Their first performances were in New York in May 2006, to support the release of their debut album, ''[[Gulag Orkestar]]''.<ref name="pitchfork37080" /><ref>{{citation|title=Beirut, the band|date=August 06, 2006|url=http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/18856/|work=New York Magazine|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}</ref> The music combines elements of [[Eastern European]] and [[Balkan]] [[folk music|folk]] with Western [[pop music]], fusing the American mainstream and [[indie-rock]] culture and the [[World Music]] market.

== History ==
=== Early Years ===
Zach Condon was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico on February 13, 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/artists/beirut |title=Beirut |accessdate=2009-01-21 |work= |publisher=New Musical Express |date= }}</ref> He was brought up in [[Virginia]] before moving back to New Mexico.<ref name="Albuquerque tribune"/><ref name="Wikipedia files">{{citation|title=The Wikipedia Files: Beirut|url=http://blogs.vocalo.org/jkaufmann/2009/07/wikipedia-files-beirut/4921|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}</ref> Zach played trumpet in a jazz band as a teenager and cites jazz as a major influence.<ref>{{citation|title = Beirut: Zach Condon<U+2019>s Brass Band Blowout|url =http://www.shockhound.com/features/386-beirut--zach-condon-s-brass-band-blowout| date = February 24, 2009 |work=  ShockHound|accessdate = December 14, 2009}}</ref> 

Condon attended [[Santa Fe High School (New Mexico)|Santa Fe High School]], where he was a student until he dropped out at the age of 16.<ref name="Wikipedia files"/> He later enrolled in community college, which he attended for a short period before traveling to [[Europe]] at the age of 17 to stay with his cousin.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2006/06/an_interview_wi_3.html|title=An interview with Beirut|work=Brooklyn Vegan|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}</ref> Here, he became aware of [[Balkans|Balkan]] folk music, most notably that of [[Goran Bregovi<U+0107>]] and [[Boban Markovi<U+0107>]]. This discovery and Condon's subsequent exploration of [[world music]] proved to be instrumental in the development of Beirut's melodic sound.<ref name="pitchfork37080" />

=== ''Gulag Orkestar'' ===
On his return from Europe, Condon enrolled at the University of New Mexico, where he studied [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Photography]].<ref name="Albuquerque tribune">{{citation|url=http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2006/oct/19/zach-condon-returns-home-land-red-and-green/|title=Zach Condon returns home to the land of red and green|work=Albuquerque Tribune|date=October 19, 2006|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}</ref> Condon recorded the bulk of the material used for ''[[Gulag Orkestar]]'' by himself in his bedroom, going into the studio to finish the album with the assistance of [[Jeremy Barnes]] ([[Neutral Milk Hotel]], [[A Hawk and a Hacksaw]]) and Heather Trost ([[A Hawk and a Hacksaw]]), who became early members of the band Beirut.

On the strength of the recordings, Condon was signed under the name of Beirut to the shortlived Ba Da Bing! records, and ''[[Gulag Orkestar]]'' was given a May 2006 release. Condon recruited some friends to play the music live for their first shows in New York, and Beirut was born.

Beirut's first official [[music video]] was for the song "[[Elephant Gun EP|Elephant Gun]]". The video was directed by Alma Har'el. The second video, which was for the song "Postcards from Italy", was also directed by Alma Har'el, and was released later. Lauren Tafuri was the costume designer for both of these videos.

=== ''The Flying Club Cup'' ===

Beirut's second album, ''[[The Flying Club Cup]],'' was recorded largely at a makeshift [[Recording studio|studio]] in [[Albuquerque]] and completed at [[Arcade Fire]]'s studio in [[Quebec]]. The music on the album has a French influence due to Condon's interest in French [[chanson]] during its recording.<ref>{{citation|title=Beirut's Zach Condon: young success 'fucked with a lot of things'|date=October 08, 2007|url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/shookdown/2007/10/beiruts_zach_condon_young_succ.php|work=All Shook Down: SF weekly|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}</ref> Condon has cited French and Belgian singers [[Jacques Brel]] (French-speaking Belgian), [[Serge Gainsbourg]] and [[Yves Montand]] (Italian/French) as influences.<ref>{{citation|title=Beirut|url=http://www.myspace.com/beruit|work=Myspace|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}</ref> He also expressed interest in [[French film]] and [[french culture|culture]], claiming this was his original reason for travelling to Europe.<ref>{{citation|title=Exclusive interview with Beirut|url=http://www.miscellanynews.com/2.1579/exclusive-interview-with-beirut-1.1312698|work=The Miscellany News| date = January 26, 2009|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}</ref> The Flying Club Cup was leaked onto the Internet in August 2007 before being officially released in October 2007. In September 2007 they did a [[Take-Away Show]] acoustic video session shot by [[Vincent Moon]].

=== ''March of the Zapotec'' ===

On April 3, 2008, Beirut canceled a previously announced summer European tour.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/42061/Beirut-Cancel-All-European-Tour-Plans|title=Beirut cancel all European tour plans|date=April 03, 2008|accessdate=December 11, 2009|work=Gigwise}}</ref> Condon explained the cancellations in a post on the official Beirut website, stating that he wanted to put the effort into ensuring that any shows would be "as good as humanly possible".<ref>{{citation|url=http://beirutband.com|title=Beirut's official website|accessdate = December 11, 2009}}</ref> Soon after, [[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] reported that Condon was working on a third album tentatively scheduled for a fall release.<ref>{{citation|url=http://lineout.thestranger.com/2008/05/greetings_from_beirut_an_interview_with|title=Greetings From Beirut! An Interview with Zach Condon|date=May 08, 2008|accessdate=December 11, 2009|work=Line Out}}</ref> This album materialized as the [[double EP]] ''[[March of the Zapotec/Holland EP]]'', containing an official Beirut release based on Condon's recent trip to [[Oaxaca]] (''March of the [[Zapotec]]''), and [[electronic music]] under the "Realpeople" name (''Holland''), to be released February 16, 2009.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/146890-beiruts-zach-condon-discusses-new-eps-time-off|title=Beirut's Zach Condon discusses new EPs, time off|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}</ref> However, the album became available for purchase on [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] on January 27, almost a month before the projected release date, and was leaked onto the internet on 23 January.

On February 6, 2009 Beirut made their [[debut]] television performance in the United States on the [[Late Show with David Letterman]], performing "A Sunday Smile".

==Legacy==
===Beirutando===
Due to their appearance on "Capitu", a mini-series that aired in Brazil, Beirut has acquired a massive following within the country. This large fan base inspired musicians in cities across the country to form tribute bands in an event called "Beirutando na Pra<U+00E7>a" (or "Beirut Day", according to Spinner.com) <ref>http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=461247049&blogId=505128098</ref> which occurred on August 30, 2009; though the groups had formed earlier in the winter of 2009. The event involved seven bands in S<U+00E3>o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Recife 
Salvador, Curitiba, and Lima performing adapted covers of Beirut songs in the streets.

Beirutando groups have adapted the songs in order to connect them to Brazilian culture by changing rhythms. As well as altering the songs, different instruments have been used, such as the "cavacolele", a [[cavaquinho]] modified with nylon strings tuned to G-C-A-E (standard ukulele tuning); this instrument was thought up because of the absence of ukuleles in Brazil. Other instruments used by Beirutando bands are the [[caj<U+00F3>n]] and the escaleta<ref>http://www.beirutband.com/</ref>.

An FAQ created by the organization stated how the idea for Beirutando was born: "Beirutando appeared in a conversation between two girls from the countryside of S<U+00E3>o Paulo, Iris and Tain<U+00E1>, concerning about good musicians and composers around the world, when Beirut was quoted. Wondering about how many people would know about Beirut here in Brazil and how good would it be if there were bands with the same potential, they had this insight: 'We could bring together people who like Beirut and start one band with different personality but that would reach the same musical level'. After spreading this idea through Orkut, a social online network, loads of people joined it and appreciated what became the Beirutando project, born in the late 2008."<ref>http://www.beirutband.com/</ref>
