'''Thomas George "Tom" Hooper''' (born 1972)<ref name=BMD>''Births, Marriages & Deaths Index of England & Wales, 1916-2005''. '''5d''': 2485.</ref> is an English [[film director]]. Hooper began making short films at the age of 13, and had his first professional short, ''Painted Faces'', broadcast on [[Channel 4]] in 1992. At [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] Hooper directed plays and television commercials. After graduating, he directed episodes of ''[[Byker Grove]]'', ''[[Quayside (soap opera)|Quayside]]'', ''[[EastEnders]]'' and ''[[Cold Feet]]''.

Into the 2000s, Hooper directed the major [[BBC]] costume dramas ''[[Love in a Cold Climate (TV serial)|Love in a Cold Climate]]'' (2001) and ''[[Daniel Deronda (TV serial)|Daniel Deronda]]'' (2002), and was selected to helm the 2003 revival of [[ITV]]'s ''[[Prime Suspect]]'' series, starring [[Helen Mirren]]. Hooper made his feature film debut with ''[[Red Dust (2004 film)|Red Dust]]'' (2004), a South African drama starring [[Hilary Swank]] and [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], before directing Helen Mirren again in the [[Company Pictures]]/[[HBO Films]] historical drama ''[[Elizabeth I (TV series)|Elizabeth I]]'' (2005). This began an association between Hooper and HBO; in 2006 he directed the [[Granada Television]]/HBO television film ''[[Longford (film)|Longford]]'' and in 2007 the epic miniseries ''[[John Adams (TV miniseries)|John Adams]]''. Hooper returned to features with ''[[The Damned United]]'' (2009), a fact-based film about the English football manager [[Brian Clough]] (played by [[Michael Sheen]]). The following year saw the release of the historical drama ''[[The King's Speech (film)|The King's Speech]]'' (2010), starring [[Colin Firth]] and [[Geoffrey Rush]], which generated Oscar buzz after film festival screenings.

Hooper's work has generally been acclaimed; he was nominated for an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or Dramatic Special|Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing]] for ''Prime Suspect'', ''Elizabeth I'' and ''John Adams'', and was nominated for the [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA TV Craft Award]] for Best Director for ''Longford''.

== Early life ==
Tom Hooper was born in London, England in 1972 to Meredith and Richard Hooper.<ref name=BMD/> Meredith was an Australian author and academic and Richard was an English media businessman. Hooper was educated at [[Highgate School]] and [[Westminster School]]. At the age of 12, he read a book entitled ''How to Make Film and Television'' and decided he wanted to become a filmmaker. Aged 13, he made his first film, entitled ''Runaway Dog'', using a clockwork 16mm [[Bolex]] camera his uncle had given to him. After completing school, Hooper took a [[gap year]] to write, produce and direct a 15-minute short film entitled ''Painted Faces''. It was broadcast on [[Channel 4]]'s ''First Frame'' strand in 1992 and had a screening at the 35th [[London Film Festival]]. The production was part-funded by [[Paul Weiland]].<ref name=Brown>Brown, Maggie (16 October 2006). "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/oct/16/mondaymediasection10 Prime candidate]". ''The Guardian'' (Guardian News & Media): p.&nbsp;6 (''MediaGuardian'' supplement).</ref>

Hooper read English at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], where he joined the [[Oxford University Dramatic Society]]. There he directed [[Kate Beckinsale]] in ''[[A View From the Bridge]]'' and [[Emily Mortimer]] in ''[[The Trial#Theatre adaptions|The Trial]]'', both at the [[Oxford Playhouse]]. He also directed television advertisements, including one for [[Sega]] featuring [[Right Said Fred]].<ref name=Burrell>Burrell, Ian (26 February 2009).

== Career ==
=== BBC and ITV productions ===
After graduating from Oxford, Hooper directed television commercials, intending to break into the film industry the same way [[Ridley Scott]],  [[Tony Scott]] and [[Hugh Hudson]] did. After a few years, he decided to change direction to television.<ref name=Brown/><ref>Johnson, Richard (21 June 2009). "In cash-strapped times British film-makers refuse to take a back seat. They're used to making a drama out of a crisis". ''The Sunday Times'' (Times Newspapers): pp.&nbsp;50<U+2013>52.</ref> He was introduced by his father to the television producer [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]].<ref name=Brown/> For Robinson, Hooper directed four episodes of the [[CBBC|Children's BBC]] television series ''[[Byker Grove]]'' in 1997, episodes of the short-lived [[Tyne Tees Television]] soap opera ''[[Quayside (soap opera)|Quayside]]'' in the same year, and his first episodes of the [[BBC One]] soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' in 1998.<ref name=Brown/><ref>"[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/405561 Tom Hooper filmography]". British Film Institute. Retrieved on 1 January 2010.</ref>

Hooper directed seven ''EastEnders'' episodes between 1998 and 2000, two of which were hour-long specials that represented the soap when it won the [[British Academy Television Awards|British Academy Television Award]] for Best Soap Opera in 2000 and 2001;<ref name=Brown/> the first was the episode in which [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) learns her daughter [[Bianca Jackson|Bianca]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) had an affair with her fianc<U+00E9> [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]), and the second was the episode in which [[Matthew Rose (EastEnders)|Matthew Rose]] ([[Joe Absolom]]) takes his revenge on [[Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp]]) for framing him for murder. The Jackson episode marked the beginning of a week of episodes that lead to Palmer's departure from the soap, and Robinson had hired Hooper to direct the key episodes of that storyline.<ref>Ellie (30 March 2010). "[http://www.walfordweb.co.uk/item.php?id=2314 Spotlight: Matthew Robinson (Part 1)]". Walford Web. Retrieved on 3 October 2010.</ref> Hooper worked 10-hour days on ''EastEnders'', and learned to direct with speed.<ref name=Burrell/> He was influenced in his early career by the cinematic style of American TV series such as ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', ''[[NYPD Blue]]'' and ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'' and tried to work that style into his ''EastEnders'' episodes; one scene featuring [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) involved a [[crane shot]], which Hooper believes he became infamous among the ''EastEnders'' production crew for using.<ref>Hooper, Tom. Radio interview with Sarah Montague. ''Today''. BBC Radio 2. 13 March 2009.</ref>

In 1999, Hooper directed two episodes of [[Granada Television]]'s comedy-drama television series ''[[Cold Feet]]'', which marked his move to bigger-budget productions.<ref name=Halper>Halper, Jenny (24 September 2009). "[http://awfj.org/2009/09/24/awfj-women-on-film-tom-hooper-on-the-damned-united-jenny-halper-interviews/ AWFJ Women On Film - Tom Hooper On "The Damned United" - Jenny Halper interviews]". Alliance of Women Film Journalists. Retrieved on 24 September 2010.</ref> There was initially concern at Granada that Hooper might be an unsuitable director for the series given his background in drama.<ref name=Brown/>

In 2000, Hooper directed his first of two costume dramas for the [[BBC]]; ''[[Love in a Cold Climate (TV serial)|Love in a Cold Climate]]'' was based on [[Nancy Mitford]]'s novels ''[[The Pursuit of Love]]'' and ''[[Love in a Cold Climate]]''. Hooper, the writer [[Deborah Moggach]], and the producer [[Kate Harwood]] researched the period details of the production by interviewing Nancy's sister [[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Deborah]].<ref>Maggoch, Deborah (20 June 2000). "Playing bit parts in my own dramas". ''The Times'' (Times Newspapers): p.&nbsp;9 (''Times2'' supplement).</ref> The following year, Hooper directed ''[[Daniel Deronda (TV serial)|Daniel Deronda]]'', adapted from [[George Eliot]]'s novel. Filming ran for 11 weeks from May to August on locations in England, Scotland and Malta.<ref>Bamigboye, Baz (31 May 2002). "Gretna's wedding TV curse". ''Daily Mail'' (Associated Newspapers): p.&nbsp;52.</ref> Hooper said of the production, "The thing I like about this tale is that it's not at all your conventional costume drama; it's far more complex and looks at aspects of love, loss and religion."<ref>Bamigboye, Baz (1 November 2002). "A driving force under the bonnet". ''Daily Mail'' (Associated Newspapers): p.&nbsp;50.</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s [[Mark Lawson]] said of Hooper's two costume dramas, "he brought verve and intelligence to television's most conservative form".<ref>Lawson, Mark (8 February 2003). "Getting real". ''The Guardian'' (Guardian News & Media): p.&nbsp;21 (''Weekend'' supplement).</ref>

Hooper returned to Granada the next year to direct the revival of ''[[Prime Suspect]]'', entitled ''The Last Witness''. The two-part serial was the first ''Prime Suspect'' installment to be made since 1995, when star [[Helen Mirren]] quit. He initially declined the offer to direct the production, believing that the series was tired. Granada's head of drama [[Andy Harries]] introduced Hooper to Mirren, who persuaded him to take the job by promising that he could make the serial his own way.<ref name=Brown/><ref name=Halper/> The two-part serial was broadcast on the [[ITV]] network in November 2003. Hooper's direction received praise from Andrew Billen in the ''[[New Statesman]]'': "Tom Hooper proved an outstanding director, imposing a bleak, overlit hyper-realism on the search for a killer in a hospital, isolating Mirren in rows of empty chairs and playing on the eyewitness/optical visual metaphors."<ref>Billen, Andrew (15/30 December 2003). "The ratings war". ''New Statesman'': p.&nbsp;104.</ref> The serial was also broadcast on [[PBS]] in the United States. Hooper received nominations for the [[British Academy Television Awards|British Academy Television Award]] for Best Drama Serial and the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or Dramatic Special]] for his work on ''Prime Suspect''.<ref>"[http://www.bafta.org/awards/television/nominations/?year=2003 Television nominations 2003]".

=== Film debut and HBO works ===
Hooper made his debut as a feature film director with the South African [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] drama ''[[Red Dust (2004 film)|Red Dust]]'' (2004), which stars [[Hilary Swank]], [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] and [[Jamie Bartlett]]. The film was not widely seen, which Hooper attributed to media coverage of torture during the [[Iraq War]]: "When I started making it you could watch the movie with a wonderful sense of "we'd never do it in our own country<U+2026>they're the horrible people but it's not us." By the time the film came out (there were) these revelations that the Americans were torturing, the British were torturing. The film became a lot more uncomfortable for the very audiences it was designed to target. I have learned that sadly the theatrical audience does not run to see films that are openly issue bled."<ref name=Halper/> The premiere of the film in the United Kingdom came on [[BBC Two]] in 2005, making it eligible for the BAFTA Television Awards; it was nominated in the Best Single Drama category at the 2006 ceremony.<ref>"[http://www.bafta.org/awards/television/nominations/?year=2005 Television nominations 2005]". British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Retrieved on 3 October 2010.</ref>

In 2005, Hooper was asked by Helen Mirren to direct the [[Company Pictures]]/[[HBO Films]] two-part serial ''[[Elizabeth I (TV series)|Elizabeth I]]''.<ref>Mirren, Helen (2007). ''In the Frame: My Life in Words and Pictures''. Weidenfeld & Nicolson: p.&nbsp;218. ISBN 0297851977.</ref> The serial won Hooper his first Emmy Award, for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or Dramatic Special.<ref name=Brown/> In January 2006, filming commenced on the Granada/HBO television film ''[[Longford (film)|Longford]]''.<ref>Bamigboye, Baz (11 November 2005). "How the lord saw good in Myra Hindley". ''Daily Mail'' (Associated Newspapers): p.&nbsp;54.</ref> The film dramatises the failed efforts of [[Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford|Lord Longford]] (played by [[Jim Broadbent]]) to secure the release from prison of [[Moors murders|Moors murderer]] Myra Hindley (played by [[Samantha Morton]]). Hooper first met with the writer [[Peter Morgan]] about the production in 2005 and the film was broadcast on [[Channel 4]] in October 2006.<ref>Hooper, Tom (26 October 2006). "Cold hearts". ''Daily Mail'' (Associated Newspapers): p.&nbsp;20.</ref> Seb Morton-Clark for the ''[[Financial Times]]'' called ''Longford'' one of the most accomplished television dramas of 2006, and praised the writer and director: "Morgan and director Tom Hooper wove a seamless narrative about obsession <U+2014> and not just that of the misguided philanthropist for the incarcerated Hindley or even that that existed between the sadistic lovers themselves. More significantly, by using chunks of original television footage, they painted a stark picture of the zealotry of a vengeful nation and its press over the supposed embodiment of evil."<ref>Morton-Clark, Seb (28 October 2006).

''Financial Times'': p.&nbsp;13.</ref> Hooper's continued successes led him to be ranked at number four in the Directors category of ''[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]'' magazine's annual Hot 100.<ref>Adams, Vernon (24 November 2006).

''Elizabeth I'' and ''Longford'' led directly to Hooper being selected by [[Tom Hanks]] to direct the epic miniseries ''[[John Adams (TV miniseries)|John Adams]]'' for [[Playtone]] and HBO. Hooper had been working on a biographical film with [[Joan Didion]] about [[Katharine Graham]], publisher of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', since 2006 when he was asked by Hanks to helm the programme.<ref>Argetsinger, Amy; Roxanne Roberts (10 March 2008).

Retrieved on 3 October 2010.</ref> ''[[The Boston Globe]]''{{'}}s Matthew Gilbert complimented Hooper's style of direction in the first two episodes "Join or Die" and "Independence":

<blockquote>Director Tom Hooper lets his actors shine, as he did so marvelously in Helen Mirren's "Elizabeth I" and the child-killer drama "Longford," but he complements them, too, with this kind of immediate point of view. And when he does give us panoramic shots from afar <U+2014> of the Adams farm in Braintree, for example <U+2014> they're askew, to keep us out of the classroom mode. At the end of episode 2 [...] Hooper showcases all his directorial strength with one bold choice. When the long-fretting Congress finally decides to break with Britain, he refrains from using any visual or aural tweaks. Upon the announcement, "The resolution carries," the scene remains perfectly silent for one long moment. The terror of responsibility hangs heavily in the room, while a victorious soundtrack surely would have chased it away.<ref>Gilbert, Matthew (14 March 2008).

=== Major feature films ===
In November 2007, Hooper signed on to direct ''[[The Damned United]]'', reuniting him with Peter Morgan and Andy Harries. The film was an adaptation of [[David Peace]]'s novel ''[[The Damned Utd]]'', a fictional version of the 44 turbulent days English football manager [[Brian Clough]] spent as manager of [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]. It was originally developed by [[Stephen Frears]] for [[Michael Sheen]] to play Clough.
