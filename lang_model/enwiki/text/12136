The '''1941 Texas hurricane''', the second storm of the [[1941 Atlantic hurricane season]], was a [[tropical cyclone]] that struck coastal [[Texas]] in September 1941, causing relatively severe damage. The storm is estimated to have formed in the eastern [[Gulf of Mexico]] on September 16. After attaining hurricane strength, it completed a clockwise loop and turned northwestward. The hurricane made landfall near [[Matagorda, Texas]] and rapidly weakened. Damage from the storm amounted to about $6.5 million. Crops throughout the region were largely destroyed. The city of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] suffered extensive damage as the storm passed to the east. Overall, four people lost their lives due to the hurricane.

Tropical Storm Two formed off the western coast of [[Florida]] on September 16, and began moving west-southwest.<ref name="hurdat"/> Operationally, the cyclone was first observed as a slight disturbance on September 18, about {{convert|180|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south of [[Louisiana]].<ref name="MWR">{{cite web|author=Howard C. Sumner|title=North Atlantic Tropical Disturbances of 1941|publisher=Weather Bureau|year=1942|accessdate=2009-10-23|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1941.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> The storm turned slightly towards the northwest before attaining Category 1 hurricane status on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]], at which point its forward motion slowed to a drift. Gradually intensifying, the storm reached its peak strength with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) early on September 20.<ref name="hurdat">{{cite web|author=Atlantic hurricane research division|year=2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1851to2008_atl_reanal.txt|title=Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT) "best track" (1851<U+2013>2008)|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations|accessdate=2009-10-23|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5gWnyE3WS|archivedate=2009-05-04|deadurl=no}}</ref> The cyclone began to drift southward toward the northern [[Yucatan Peninsula]], ultimately completing a clockwise loop over the central Gulf of Mexico. After turning back towards the north, the storm sped up slightly; by late on September 21, it was situated near the region where it was first detected.<ref name="MWR"/>

By September 22, the hurricane had begun to weaken, although it maintained hurricane status for a couple more days. The cyclone tracked generally northwestward, crossing the western half of the gulf, and moved ashore near [[Matagorda, Texas]], during the afternoon hours of September 23;<ref name="MWR"/> on making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]], it weakened to a tropical storm.<ref name="hurdat"/> Continuing inland, the storm, quickly deteriorating, accelerate northeastward. The center of the storm passed just to the east of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], where [[barometric pressure]] fell to 971 [[millibar|mb]], the lowest recorded in association with the hurricane.<ref name="MWR"/> The storm became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] late on September 24, as it progressed rapidly through the [[Mississippi Valley]]; its remnants eventually entered southern portions of [[Quebec]].<ref name="hurdat"/><ref name="MWR"/>

==Preparations==
In advance of the storm, advisories and warnings were widely distributed by press, radio, telegraph and telephone. About 25,000 residents evacuated their homes; some small towns along the coast were described as "deserted".<ref name="MWR"/> People in low-lying areas of coastal Louisiana sought shelter as [[storm surge]] from the hurricane affected the northern [[Gulf Coast]]. Hundreds of military aircraft in southern Louisiana moved inland for shelter, while the [[Coast Guard]] and other relief agencies worked to transport fishermen and oil workers to safer locations.<ref>{{cite news|author=|title=Gulf Storm Is Headed For Texas|date=September 22, 1941|work=The Evening Independent|accessdate=2009-10-23|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aqkLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KVUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3460,5129833}}</ref> Residents in Texas prepared their homes and businesses for the hurricane, and boat owners pulled their craft out of the water. In [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]], structures were boarded up and hundreds of refugees sought shelter in local hotels. [[American Red Cross]] workers were dispatched to the state. In Houston, a temporary hospital was erected. Police and firefighters in the city were put on alert. Vessels near the storm were advised to proceed with caution.<ref>{{cite news|author=|title=Hurricane Poised To Hit Texas|Date=September 23, 2009|work=The Evening Independent|accessdate=2009-10-23|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a6kLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KVUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6415,5231439}}</ref>

==Impact==
Overall damage from the storm totaled approximately $7 million, of which about $4 million can be attributed to the destruction of crops, notably rice and cotton.<ref name="MWR"/>  

Winds along the coast of Texas reached {{convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at numerous points near the hurricane's center. A report from [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] explained, "There was little characteristic of sky appearance prior to the advent of the storm, the sky being mostly clear until lower clouds appeared suddenly between 6 and 7 a.m. C.S.T., on the 22rd with alto-cumulus and alto-stratus overcast showing through breaks occasionally during the day. By late afternoon of the 22nd the sky became completely overcast with low clouds of bad weather which predominated throughout the remainder of the storm."<ref name="MWR"/> Tides at the city, already slightly above-normal due to a previous storm, rose to a crest of {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=on}} on September 23, flooding large portions of [[Galveston Island]]. A local airport was flooded with {{convert|1|to|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} of tidewater.<ref name="MWR"/> 

As the hurricane moved inland, the city of Houston was hit especially hard. Three people in the area died and several others were injured.<ref>{{cite news|author=|title=Hurricane Hits Houston In Twist|date=September 25, 1941|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-10-23|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10F16FA3A5B147B93C7AB1782D85F458485F9}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=|title=Hurricane Races North Raging Thru Texas|date=September 24, 1941|work=Ludington Daily News|accessdate=2009-10-24|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r88KAAAAIBAJ&sjid=804DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5700,3283942&dq=1941+texas+hurricane&hl=en}}</ref> Winds blew at up to {{convert|77|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, catching many off-guard after a previous forecast that deemed the region was safe. Some sections of the city were left without power. The winds destroyed poorly built structures and damaged others, and some streets were flooded. An athletic stadium was demolished by the storm, and glass windows were shattered in downtown stores. A preliminary estimate placed the damage in Houston at $500,000. In the aftermath of the storm, fifteen truckloads of shattered glass were removed.<ref>{{cite news|author=|title=Damage In Millions As Hurricane Hits Texas|date=September 24, 1941|work=The Evening Independent|accessdate=2009-10-23|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bKkLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KVUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2709,5353456}}</ref>
