"'''Black Widow'''" is a song by Australian rapper [[Iggy Azalea]], from her debut studio album, ''[[The New Classic]]'' (2014). It was written by Azalea, [[Katy Perry]], [[Sarah Hudson (singer)|Sarah Hudson]], [[Benny Blanco|Benjamin Levin]] and duo [[StarGate]]; the latter also produced the song. Initially a track recorded by Perry for her fourth studio album ''[[Prism (Katy Perry album)|Prism]]'' (2013), the song was excluded from its tracklisting, however Perry handed the song to Azalea for her to complete. "Black Widow" is influenced by [[Snap music|snap]] and [[Trap (music genre)|trap]] genres, containing an ominous [[Steel pan|steel drum]] [[rhythm]], heavy [[Bass (instrument)|bass]] and a sparse [[Beat (music)|beat]]. The song's [[Hook (music)|hook]] is sung by British recording artist [[Rita Ora]], and its lyrics chronicle subjects of revenge and [[feminism]] in a failed romantic relationship. 

Its composition has been the subject of music critics' comparisons to Perry's "[[Dark Horse (Katy Perry song)|Dark Horse]]" and other StarGate productions, some of which have been negative. Other journalists, however, praised its beat and Azalea and Ora's vocals. "Black Widow" charted due to strong digital sales during the debut week of ''The New Classic''. Accordingly, it achieved peaks of number 91 in the United Kingdom and number 86 in Australia, and appeared on several component charts. Azalea has performed the song live as part of the set list for her first headlining tour, [[The New Classic Tour]] (2014).
==Background==

In early 2013, Azalea made a friendship with American recording artist [[Katy Perry]] through [[Chris Anokute]], an [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] at Azalea's record label [[Island Records]]. Anokute, who previously was an A&R for Perry at her label [[Capitol Records]], told Azalea that Perry was a fan of her music. When Azalea was nominated at the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]], Anokute asked Perry if she could promote Azalea so that she could win votes in her category for Artist to Watch. Perry then took to [[Twitter]] to rave about Azalea's music, and Azalea later consulted Anokute about a future collaboration with Perry. Shortly afterward, Azalea and Perry begun working together with the latter's frequent collaborator [[Dr. Luke]], but the collaboration proved unsuccessful. Azalea then heard about a song Perry recorded, "Black Widow", which was going to be given away to another artist.<ref name="EW">{{cite news|author=Anderson, Kyle|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2014/04/11/iggy-azalea-the-new-classic-interview/|title=Iggy Azalea on chicken franchising, Australian rap, and learning from Beyonce: An EW Q&A|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=11 April 2014|accessdate=30 May 2014}}</ref> The song was initially written as a last-minute addition to Perry's fourth studio album, ''[[Prism (Katy Perry album)|Prism]]'' (2013), but the composition finalized only after the album's release.<ref name="Lee">{{cite web|author=Lee, Christina|url=http://m.idolator.com/7519673/iggy-azalea-katy-perry-black-widow|title=Iggy Azalea's 'Black Widow' Was Originally A Katy Perry Song|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]].

On 4 June 2013, Azalea confirmed that British recording artist [[Rita Ora]] would feature on her debut studio ''[[The New Classic]]'', after previously announcing Ora's feature on 26 December 2012. She stated, "I had a song in mind, and I need a woman with a big voice to sing the chorus because I can't do it".<ref>{{cite web|author=Rigby, Sam|url=http://m.digitalspy.com/music/news/a486993/iggy-azalea-confirms-rita-ora-collaboration-i-needed-a-big-voice.html#~oFKEkl4Zmr4fKQ|title=Iggy Azalea confirms Rita Ora collaboration: 'I needed a big voice'|publisher=[[Digital Spy]].

At the festival, Perry approached Azalea with an offer to record "Black Widow" as she felt the song would suit her better. Azalea was then invited to Perry's after party that night, where the two exchanged numbers, and Perry sent Azalea the record. When Azalea received the song, it only consisted of a [[Hook (music)|hook]] and a [[Beat (music)|beat]]. She initially wanted Perry to sing the song's hook, but Perry was unable to because of time constraints. In an interview, Azalea mentioned, "It needed someone who could really sing, as Katy's voice is awesome. The sky's the limit for Rita. Rita's a superstar and she will only get bigger. Rita is a great fit. Her voice can blow people away."<ref>{{cite web|author=Adejobi, Alicia|url=https://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/148204/Why-Was-Katy-Perry-Swapped-For-Rita-Ora-On-Iggy-Azaleas-Black-Widow-Track|title=Why Was Katy Perry Swapped For Rita Ora On Iggy Azalea's 'Black Widow' Track?|publisher=Entertainmentwise.

Tim Blacksmith and Danny D. were responsible for the song's [[Executive producer|executive production]] and production co-ordination.

Azalea and Ora recorded their vocals for the song at [[Record Plant]] and [[Westlake Recording Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]], and Jungle City Studios in [[New York]]. Their vocals were [[Audio engineering|engineered]] by Daniel Zaidenstadt and Eriksen, while [[Miles Walker]] was credited as the track's assistant vocal engineer. [[Phil Tan]] completed the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] process at Ninja Club Studios in [[Atlanta]], with the assistance of Daniela Rivera.<ref name="Notes"/> The song was originally rumoured to be produced by both StarGate and Benny Blanco, though upon the release of the album, Blanco was only credited as a songwriter under his real name Benjamin Levin.<ref name="Gigwise">{{cite web|author=Pollard, Alexandra|url=http://www.gigwise.com/newmusic/90313/listen-iggy-azalea-and-rita-ora-reveal-new-song-black-widow|title=Listen: Iggy Azalea and Rita Ora reveal new song 'Black Widow'|publisher=Gigwise.
