[[File:Cade Murdoch No Mercy 07.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[WWE No Mercy 2007]] was a live pay-per-view event produced by [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] on October 7, 2007 from the [[Allstate Arena]] in [[Rosemont, Illinois]].]]

'''Pay-per-view''' ('''PPV''') provides a service by which a [[television]] audience can purchase events to view via private telecast. The broadcaster shows the event at the same time to everyone ordering it (as opposed to [[video-on-demand]] systems, which allow viewers to see recorded broadcasts at any time). Events can be purchased using an on-screen guide, an automated telephone system, or through a live customer service representative. Events often include [[feature film]]s, [[sport]]ing events and [[entertainment]].

===United States===

The [[Zenith]] Phonevision system became the first pay-per-view system tested in the United States.  Developed in 1951, it used [[telephone]] lines to take and receive orders as well as to de-scramble a broadcast signal.  Phonevision field-tests ran for 90 days in [[Chicago]].
The system used IBM [[punched card]]s to de-scramble a signal broadcast during the broadcast station's "off-time".  Both systems showed promise, but the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] denied them permits.<ref>FCC Squares Off to Face Subscription TV Dilemma", ''Broadcasting-Telecasting'', November 15, 1954, p31-32

One of the earliest pay-per-view systems on cable, the Optical Systems [[Channel 100]], first entered service in 1972 in [[San Diego]] through Mission Cable<ref>

(acquired by [[Cox Communications]]) and TheaterVisioN, which operated out of [[Sarasota, Florida]]. These early systems quickly went out of business, as the cable industry adopted satellite technology and as flat-rate systems like [[Home Box Office]] became popular.

Boxing fans were first introduced to their sport on pay-per-view with the [[Muhammad Ali]] vs. [[Joe Frazier]] fight "[[Thrilla In Manila]]", there was also another in 1980, when [[Roberto Duran]] defeated [[Sugar Ray Leonard]]. Cable companies offered the match for $10, and about 155,000 customers paid to watch the fight.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Seepersaud |url=http://ca.askmen.com/sports/business_60/99_sports_business.html |title=Money in Boxing: The Pay-Per-View Craze |publisher=Ca.askmen.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}</ref>

A major pay-per-view event{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} occurred on September 16, 1981, when [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] [[Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Thomas Hearns|fought]] [[Thomas Hearns|Thomas "Hitman" Hearns]] for the [[World Welterweight Champion|Welterweight Championship]]. Viacom Cablevision in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], the first system to offer the event, sold over fifty percent of its subscribers<!-- to whom? --> for the fight.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Leonard visited Nashville to promote the fight, and the event proved such a success that Viacom themed its [[annual report]] for that year around it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Viacom's Marketing Director was Pat Thompson who put together the fight and subsequently put together additional PPV fights, wrestling matches, and even a Broadway play.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

After leaving Viacom, Thompson became head of [[Sports View]] and produced the first pay-per-view [[American football|football]] game on October 16, 1983, when [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]] played [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] from [[Birmingham, Alabama]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Sports View played a role in building pay-per-view networks {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and became the early pioneer in developing TigerVision for LSU, TideVision for Alabama, and UT Vol Seat for Tennessee. Sports View also produced the Ohio State-Michigan Football game on PPV in November 1983.

In 1985, the first U.S. cable channels devoted to pay-per-view, ''[[In Demand|Viewer's Choice]]'', ''[[Cable Video Store]]'', ''[[First Choice]]'', and ''[[Request TV]]'' began operation within days of each other.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Viewer's Choice serviced both home satellite-dish and cable customers, while Request TV, though broadcasting to cable viewers, would not become available to dish-owners until the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

First Choice PPV was available on Rogers Cablesystems in the United States and Canada.
When Paragon Cablesystems acquired the Rogers Cablesystems in San Antonio, Texas First Choice continued until 1996 when Time Warner Cable bought Paragon Cablesystems in San Antonio, Texas.

The term "pay-per-view" did not come into general use until the late 1980s{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} <!-- what did people call the technology before that? --> when companies like [[iN DEMAND]], [[Home Box Office|HBO]], and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] started using the system to show movies and some of their productions. In Demand would show movies, concerts, and other events, with live sporting events such as [[WrestleMania]] predominant. Prices ranging from [[United States dollar|$]]3.99 to $49.99, while HBO and Showtime, with their [[swap (finance)|leg]]s [[TVKO]] and [[SET Pay Per View]], would offer championship [[boxing]] with prices ranging from $14.99 to $54.99.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

[[ESPN]] has shown [[college]] [[American football|football]] and [[basketball]] games on pay-per-view.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The [[boxing]] [[undercard]] ''[[Latin Fury]]'', shown on June 28, 2003, became [[ESPN]]'s first boxing pay-per-view [[Card (sports)|card]] and also the first pay-per-view boxing card held in [[Puerto Rico]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Pay-per-view has provided a [[revenue stream]] for [[professional wrestling]] companies like [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE), [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA), [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) and [[Asistencia Asesor<U+00ED>a y Administraci<U+00F3>n]].

In the United States pay-per-view broadcasters transmit without advertisements, unlike almost all other broadcasters.

[[Vince McMahon]], the chairman of [[World Wrestling Entertainment]], is considered by many as one of the icons of pay-per-view promotion. He owns the rights to payperview.com, which redirects to the WWE website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whois.domaintools.com/payperview.com |title=PayPerView.com - WWE Online Pay-Per-View |publisher=Whois.domaintools.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}</ref>

====HBO PPV====
In 2006 HBO generated 3,700,000 pay-per-view [[Trade|buy]]s with $177,000,000 in gross sales. The only year with more buys previously, 1999, had a total of 4,000,000.  However, the record fell in 2007 when HBO sold 4,800,000 PPV buys with $255,000,000 in sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=3158134 |title=Mayweather-Hatton pay-per-view a smashing success |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-12-17 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}</ref>

But 1999 differed radically from 2006. 1999 saw De La Hoya-Trinidad (1,400,000 buys), Holyfield-Lewis I (1,200,000), Holyfield-Lewis II (850,000), and De La Hoya-Quartey (570,000). By contrast, only one pay-per-view [[mega-fight]] took place in 2006: De La Hoya-Mayorga (925,000 buys). Rahman-Maskaev bombed with under 50,000. The other eight PPV cards last year{{When|date=December 2009}} all fell in the 325,000-450,000 range. Pay-per-view fights in that range almost always generate more money for the promoter and fighters than HBO wants to pay for an HBO World Championship Boxing license-fee.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In May 2007, the super-welterweight boxing match between [[Oscar De La Hoya vs. Floyd Mayweather|Oscar De La Hoya and Floyd Mayweather Jr.]] on HBO PPV became the biggest-selling non-heavyweight title fight, with a little more than 2.5 million buyers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The fight itself generated roughly $134.4 million dollars in domestic PPV revenue, making it the most lucrative prizefight of all time.

The leading PPV attraction, Oscar De La Hoya,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} has "sold" approximately 12.8 million [[wikt:unit|unit]]s in total, giving $612 million in domestic television receipts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} In third place in buys, Evander Holyfield has achieved 12.6 million units ($543 million); and in second, Mike Tyson has reached 12.4 million units ($545 million).{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}<ref>Credit ESPN Boxing: [http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=3079329&campaign=rss&source=BOXINGHeadlines link needs updating]

HBO Sports President Ross Greenburg calls the expansion of pay-per-view "the biggest economic issue in boxing" and says:

"I can't tell you that pay-per-view helps the sport because it doesn't. It hurts the sport because it narrows our audience, but it's a fact of life. Every time we try to make an HBO World Championship Boxing fight, we're up against mythical pay-per-view numbers. HBO doesn't make a lot of money from pay-per-view. There's usually a cap on what we can make. But the promoters and fighters insist on pay-per-view because that's where their greatest profits lie." {{cite quote|date=November 2010}}

"It's a big problem," Greenburg continues. "It's getting harder and harder to put fighters like Manny Pacquiao on HBO World Championship Boxing. If Floyd Mayweather beats Oscar, he might never fight on HBO World Championship Boxing again. But if HBO stopped doing pay-per-view, the promoters would simply do it on their own [like Bob Arum did with Cotto-Malignaggi in June 2006] or find someone else who will do it for them."{{Cite quote|date=April 2009}}

Former HBO Sports President Seth Abraham concurs, saying, "I think, if Lou (DiBella) and I were still at HBO, we'd be in the same pickle as far as the exodus of fights to pay-per-view is concerned."<ref>[http://www.secondsout.com/usa/colhauser.cfm?ccs=208&cs=21089 ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>

====UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship)====

[[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC), a relative newcomer on the pay-per-view scene, "matched the once-dominant [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] Inc. in pay-per-view revenues during 2006 and surpassed boxing titan HBO. The three companies make up the bulk of the pay-per-view business."{{Cite quote|date=March 2009}}  According to Deana Myers, a senior analyst at [[SNL Financial|Kagan Research LLC]] (which tracks the PPV industry), "UFC has reinvigorated the pay-per-view category."<ref>Goldman, Adam.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], [[First Choice]] offers pay-per-view services through various Canadian [[Satellite television|satellite TV]] and [[digital cable]] television-providers, including [[Rogers Cable Inc.|Rogers Digital Cable]], [[Shaw Direct]], and [[Manitoba Telecom Services|MTS]]. Prices range from [[Canadian dollar|C$]]5.99 (for movies) up to $20 or more for special events. [[Bell TV]] delivers its own pay-per-view service, [[Vu!]], to its satellite subscribers.

==Europe==
===Albania===
In November 2008 pay-per-view scheduled its debut in Albania through Digitalb with the channel DigiGold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalb.al/ppv/ |title=Digitalb - Pay per View :: Digigold |publisher=Digitalb.al |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
Viewers in the United Kingdom can access pay-per-view via satellite, cable and over-the-internet television services, mainly for films - with services such as [[Sky Box Office (UK)|Sky Box Office]]. Broadcasters (most notably [[PremPlus]]) have largely abandoned their aspirations to introduce PPV into the sports market due to poor take-up; {{As of | 2009 | lc = on}} it carries only occasional boxing matches and half of the [[WWE]] PPV events, with the other half shown on [[Sky Sports]].

===France===
Started in Late 90's, Canalsat (Cin<U+00E9>+) and TPS (Multivision) launch their own PPV Service. While CanalSat has got rights for Live Soccer Matches for France's Ligue 1, TPS had the rights for Boxe matches. In 2007, Multivision service ceased by the end of TPS service which merged with Canalsat. Nowadays, Cin<U+00E9>+ is the only existing PPV service in France.

==Australia and the Pacific Islands==
