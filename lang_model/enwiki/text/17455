'''''Oslyabya''''' ({{lang-ru|<U+041E><U+0441><U+043B><U+044F><U+0431><U+044F>}}) was the second of the three {{sclass|Peresvet|battleship|0}} [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] at the end of the nineteenth century, although construction delays meant that she was the last to be completed. The ship was part of the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Second Pacific Squadron]] sent to the [[Far East]] during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904<U+2013>05, serving as the [[flagship]] of [[Rear Admiral]] Baron [[Dmitry fon-Felkerzam]]. ''Oslyabya'' was sunk on 27 May 1905 at the [[Battle of Tsushima]], and has the inauspicious distinction of being history's first all-steel battleship to be sunk by naval gunfire alone.<ref>Forczyk, p. 62</ref> Sources differ on the exact number of losses, but over half her crew was lost with the ship.

==Design and description==
The design of the ''Peresvet'' class was inspired by the [[Royal Navy|British]] second-class battleships of the {{sclass|Centurion|battleship|4}}. The British ships were intended to defeat commerce-raiding [[armored cruiser]]s like the Russian ships {{ship|Russian cruiser|Rossia||2}} and {{ship|Russian cruiser|Rurik|1892|2}} and the ''Peresvet'' class were designed to support their armored cruisers. This role placed a premium on high speed and long range at the expense of heavy armament and armor.<ref name=m8>McLaughlin, p. 108</ref>

''Oslyabya'' was {{convert|434|ft|5|in|m|1}} long [[length overall|long overall]], had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|71|ft|6|in|m}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|26|ft|3|in|m|1}}. Designed to displace {{convert|12674|LT|t|lk=in}}, she was almost {{convert|2000|LT|t}} overweight and displaced {{convert|14408|LT|t}}. Her crew consisted of 27 officers and 744 enlisted men. The ship was powered by three [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]] using steam generated by 30 [[Belleville boiler]]s. The engines were rated at {{convert|14500|ihp|lk=in}}, using [[forced draught]], and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|18|kn|lk=in}}. ''Oslyabya'', however, reached a top speed of {{convert|18.33|kn}} from {{convert|15051|ihp}} during her [[sea trial]]s in September 1902. She carried a maximum of {{convert|2060|LT|t}} of coal which allowed her to steam for {{convert|6200|lk=in|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 107<U+2013>08, 114</ref>

The ship's [[main battery]] consisted of four {{convert|10|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns mounted in two twin-[[gun turret]]s, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. The [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary armament]] consisted of eleven [[Canet guns|Canet]] {{convert|6|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF) gun]]s, mounted in [[casemate]]s on the sides of the hull and in the bow, underneath the [[forecastle]]. A number of smaller guns were carried for defence against [[torpedo boat]]s. These included twenty {{convert|75|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} QF guns, twenty {{convert|47|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun]]s and eight {{convert|37|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} guns. She was also armed with five {{convert|15|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s, three above water and two submerged. The ship carried 45 [[Naval mine|mines]] to be used to protect her anchorage. ''Oslyabya''{{'}}s [[waterline]] [[belt armor|armor belt]] consisted of [[Harvey armor]] and was {{convert|4|-|9|in|0}} thick. The [[Krupp cemented armor]] of her gun turrets had a maximum thickness of {{convert|9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} and her [[deck (ship)|deck]] ranged from {{convert|2|to|3|in|0}} in thickness.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 107<U+2013>08, 112<U+2013>14</ref>

==Career==
''Oslyabya'', named for [[Oslyabya|Rodion Oslyabya]], a 14th century monk of the [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]] and a hero of the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] in 1380,<ref>Silverstone, p. 380</ref> was [[Keel|laid down]] on 21 November 1895 by the [[Admiralty Shipyard|New Admiralty Shipyard]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 8 November 1898. Problems at the New Admiralty Shipyard seriously delayed her completion until 1903 at the cost of 11,340,000 [[rubles]]. The ship sailed for [[L<U+00FC>shunkou District|Port Arthur]] on 7 August 1903, but ''Oslyabya'' ran aground in the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] on 21 August and was under repair until November at [[La Spezia]], Italy. The ship was in the [[Red Sea]] when the Russo-Japanese War began in February 1904 and she was recalled to join the Baltic Fleet.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 107, 110, 112, 114<U+2013>15</ref>

''Oslyabya'' was fitted with {{convert|4.5|ft|m|1|adj=on}} [[Barr & Stroud]] [[rangefinders]], telescopic [[gun sight]]s and [[Telefunken]] [[radio]] equipment when she arrived back in Saint Petersburg.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 166</ref> On 15 October 1904, she set sail for Port Arthur from [[Liepaja|Libau]] as fon-Felkerzam's [[flagship]] along with the other vessels of the Second Pacific Squadron, under the overall command of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Zinovy Rozhestvensky]].<ref>Forczyk, p. 9</ref> En route to Denmark, the battleship was slightly damaged when the destroyer {{ship|Russian destroyer|Buistri|1901|2}} accidentally collided with her.<ref>Pleshakov, p. 92</ref> When his ships reached the port of [[Tangier]], Morocco, on 28 October, Rozhestvensky ordered his older battleships, under the command of fon-Felkerzam, to go through the Mediterranean and Red Sea to rendezvous with his main force in [[Madagascar]]. Rozhestvensky led his squadron, including ''Oslyabya'', down the Atlantic coast of Africa, rounding [[Cape Horn]], and reached the island of [[Nosy Be]] off the north-west coast of Madagascar on 9 January 1905 where they remained for two months while Rozhestvensky finalized his coaling arrangements. The combined squadron sailed for [[Camranh Bay]], [[French Indochina]], on 16 March and reached it on almost a month later to await the obsolete ships of the 3rd Pacific Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral [[Nikolai Nebogatov]]. The latter ships reached Camranh Bay on 9 May and the combined force sailed for [[Vladivostok]] on 14 May.<ref name=m167>McLaughlin, p. 167</ref>

Rozhestvensky reorganized his ships into three divisions, the first consisted of the four new {{sclass|Borodino|battleship}}s commanded by himself, fon-Felkerzam commanded the second division that consisted of the battleships ''Oslyabya'', {{ship|Russian battleship|Navarin||2}}, {{ship|Russian battleship|Sissoi Veliky||2}} and the armored cruiser {{ship|Russian armoured cruiser|Admiral Nakhimov||2}} while Nebogatov retained his ships as the third division. Fon-Felkerzam, ill with cancer, died on 26 May and Rozhestvensky decided not to inform the fleet in order to keep morale up. ''Oslyabya''{{'}}s [[Captain 1st Rank]] Vladimir Ber became the commander of the 2nd Division while Nebogatov had no idea that he was now the squadron's defacto second-in-command.<ref>Forczyk, pp. 25, 56</ref>

During the Battle of Tsushima on 28 May, ''Oslyabya'' led the Second Division of the squadron and was initially the target of two battleships and a pair of armored cruisers when the Japanese opened fire at 1410. Almost immediately, they began inflicting damage, knocking out the rangefinder, wounding the gunnery officer and severing the cables connecting the guns to the Geisler [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control system]]. Other hits shot away the [[mainmast]] and knocked out the forward gun turret as well as three of her port 6-inch guns. Splinters from one of the many hits entered her conning tower, killing the [[quartermaster]] and wounding most of the men inside. This caused the ship to fall out of line to starboard and she was engaged by six Japanese cruisers at short range. More serious were a number of large-caliber shells that struck along the ship's waterline beginning about 15 minutes into the engagement that caused major flooding; they opened up enough of the ship's bow to the sea that her forward motion forced more and more water into her hull that she began [[list (watercraft)|listing]] to port. Flooding of her starboard forward [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] was ordered in an attempt to counteract the list, but it just added more weight forward and destroyed the ship's stability. ''Oslyabya'' rolled over to port until her [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s touched the water around 1515 and Captain Ber ordered "abandon ship".<ref>Forczyk, pp. 61<U+2013>62</ref> The ship sank a few minutes later, with her starboard propeller still turning, taking Captain Ber and 470 of her crew with her.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 168</ref>{{#tag:ref|Campbell says that 385 survivors were rescued by Russian destroyers, but 514 men went down with the ship, while Forczyk agrees with McLaughlin.<ref>Campbell, p. 131</ref>|group=Note}}
