'''Krishna II''' ([[878]] - [[914]]) C.E. ascended the [[Rashtrakuta]] throne after the demise of his famous father [[Amoghavarsha I]]. His [[Kannada]] name was '''Kannara'''.<ref name="name">Reu (1933), p75</ref> He queen was a Haihaya princess of [[Chedi]] called Mahadevi. From the chronology of inscriptions that mention the name of this king, it seems Krishna II may have started to rule even during the life time of his father. The fact that Amoghavarsha in his last years renounced the affairs of the state in religious pursuits supports this claim.<ref name="fame">Reu (1933), p76</ref> The rule of Krishna II was a good one for literature, though in the affairs of expansion of the empire, his reign was mixed. 

==Vengi affairs==
His rule was one of mixed fortunes. He suffered some reversals against the [[Eastern Chalukyas]] ruled by King Gunaga Vijyaditya III whose commander pursued Krishna II to central India. After the death of Vijayaditya III, Krishna II continued hostilities against Chalukya Bhima I in 892 and succeeded in defeating him and took him prisoner. However, Bhima I later freed himself and pushed back the Rashtrakutas from [[Vengi]] and crowned himself king. A few years later, Krishna II suffered two more defeats at the hands of the Vengi Chalukyas at Niravadyapura and Peruvanguru.<ref name="peru">Sastri (1955), p160</ref> However other sources claim Krishna II conquered [[Andhra]].<ref name="fame"/> 

==Deccan and northern affairs==
Krishna II defeated the Gurjara Bhoja I of [[Prathihara]] dynasty of [[Gujarat]], merged the Lata line (Gujarat) of Rashtrakutas and brought it under his direct rule from [[Manyakheta]].<ref name="direct">Kamath (2001), p80</ref><ref name="fame"/><ref name="peru"/> He defeated the kingdoms of Banga, Kalinga, Magadha. It is claimed his kingdom extended from the [[Ganges|Ganga]] river in the north to [[Cape Comorin]] in the south.<ref name="fame"/> He held titles such as ''Akalavarsha'' and ''Shubatunga''. 

==Tamil politics==
His daughter had married a [[Chola]] king Aditya I and with this the king had hoped to achieve influence in Tamil country. When Parantaka became the king after the death of Aditya I and his grandson Kannara did not, Krishna II invaded the Chola kingdom with the help of the Banas and Vaidumbas, hoping to force the issue. He failed to consolidate his influence on the [[Cholas]]. The Rashtrakutas suffered a defeat in the battle of Vallala at the hands of [[Cholas]] under Parantaka I 916.<ref name="defeat">Sastri (1955), pp160-161</ref>
