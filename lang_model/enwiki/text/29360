The '''Queen's Park Oval''' is a [[sports stadium]] in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Privately owned by the [[Queen's Park Cricket Club]], it is currently the largest capacity cricket ground in the [[West Indies]] with seating for about 25,000. It has hosted more [[Test cricket|Test matches]] than any other ground in the Caribbean, and also hosted a number of [[One Day International]] (ODI) matches, including many [[World Series Cricket]] games in 1979 and matches of the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. The [[Trinidad and Tobago cricket team]] play most of their home matches at the ground,<ref name="cricpro" /> and it is the home ground of the [[Caribbean Premier League]] team [[Trinidad and Tobago Red Steel]].

Considered by many players, journalists and critics as one of the most picturesque cricket venues,<ref name="cricpro" /><ref>{{cite book | title=Boycott: The Autobiography | publisher=Pan Macmillan | author=Boycott, Geoff | year=2006 | page=81 | isbn=0330447378}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/picturegalleries/9721411/Scyld-Berrys-top-five-Test-cricket-grounds.html?frame=2417716&page=0 | title=Queen's Park Oval - Scyld Berry's top five Test cricket grounds | publisher=The Daily Telegraph | date=December 4, 2012 | accessdate=15 January 2014 | author=Berry, Scyld}}</ref><ref>Beckles, Stoddart (1999) p. 141.</ref> the ground first hosted a Test match in February 1930 when [[England cricket team|England]] toured the [[Caribbean]], though it had previously hosted many [[first class cricket|first class]] tours as early as the 1897 tour under [[Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke|Lord Hawke]].<ref name="cricpro">{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wc2007/content/ground/59475.html | title=Queen's Park Oval | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref> The pavilion dates back to 1896, though there were extensive renovations in the 1950s and in 2007 prior to the World Cup and following an earthquake.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/279573.html | title=Queen's Park Oval pavilion unveiled | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | date=February 8, 2007 | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/281808.html | title=Earthquake shakes Antigua and Trinidad | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | date=February 27, 2007 | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref> The "Concrete Stand" was renamed the "[[Learie Constantine]] Stand" in recognition of that former West Indies cricketer.

As well as the main cricket stadium, the facility includes a gym, indoor and outdoor cricket practice nets, two [[Squash (sport)|squash]] courts and two outdoor [[tennis]] courts. The cricket field has also been used to host several domestic and international [[association football|football]] matches, and several music events.

==Cricketing history==

===Early years===
[[File:Ranji 1897 page 173 Lord Hawke running out to drive.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Lord Hawke]], who led the earliest first-class tours to the ground.]]
The Queen's Park Oval Cricket Club leased the Queen's Park Oval in 1896, moving there from its first home at the [[Queen's Park Savannah]], where it had existed since its founding in 1891.<ref name="QPCChistory">{{cite web | url=http://www.qpcc.com/content/club-history | title=Queen's Park Cricket Club - A History | publisher=Queen's Park Cricket Club | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> The natural soil at the ground prevented turf wickets from being laid down, due to the damage caused by the [[mole cricket]]s that inhabited it, so when the club moved to its new ground the groundsmen laid a pitch of clay with a wicket made of matting prepared on top.<ref name="cricpro" /> A popular venue due to its capacity (7,000 when first constructed, the highest in the Caribbean) the ground was very profitable for the owning cricket club.<ref name="cricpro" /> The first match recorded by [[Cricket Archive]], [[CricInfo]] and ''[[Wisden]]'' took place there on January 29, 1897, between Lord Hawke's touring party and a team put out by the Queen's Park Oval Club. The match, which was a draw but saw the ground's first century<U+2014>119 by [[Plum Warner]]<U+2014>was not counted as [[First class cricket|first-class]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/135/135035.html | title=Queen's Park v Lord Hawke's XI Lord Hawke's XI in West Indies 1896/97 | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> Only a few days later on February 1 the ground's maiden first-class fixture took place between [[Trinidad cricket team|Trinidad]] and the same Lord Hawke's XI. The home team won by 137 runs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4703.html | title=Trinidad v Lord Hawke's XI Lord Hawke's XI in West Indies 1896/97 | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> The two teams met at the Oval again on February 5, when Trinidad were victorious once more.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4704.html | title=Trinidad v Lord Hawke's XI (Second Match) Lord Hawke's XI in West Indies 1896/97 | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> [[Arthur Priestley]]'s touring eleven then played a Queen's Park XI on February 12, with the game drawn.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/135/135029.html | title=Queen's Park v A Priestley's XI A Priestley's XI in West Indies 1896/97 | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref>

During the first decades of the twentieth century, the private Queen's Park Oval was a very exclusive cricket ground and club. [[C. L. R. James]] records that "they were for the most part white and often wealthy" and that "a black man in the Queen's Park was rare and usually anonymous."<ref>James (1963) p. 65-66.</ref> The Queens Park club was "the big shot" of the local cricket on the island,<ref>James (1963) p. 71-75.</ref> and touring matches were the mainstay of cricket at the ground for the first few years. They also contributed to the growth of cricket on the island, for trial matches were held on weekends while a tour was in progress, and local talent was invited to play.<ref>James (1963) p. 80-81.</ref> In April 1899 Trinidad played a [[Barbados]]-based XI led by [[Arthur Bertram St Hill|Arthur St. Hill]], an early domestic West Indian fixture.<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" /> By 1900, [[Inter-Colonial Tournament]] matches were taking place, with the final between Barbados and [[British Guiana]] taking place at the Queen's Park Oval.<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval">{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/30/1791_f.html | title=First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> These became more and more frequent in the first decade of the 20th Century, along with more tour games against the invitational XIs of [[Richard Bennett (cricketer)|Richard Bennett]] and [[John Egerton, 4th Earl of Ellesmere|Lord Brackley]].<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" /> The ground hosted the finals of the 1906 and 1910 Inter-Colonial Tournaments.

In 1911 and in 1913 the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) toured the West Indies, with four matches played in total between the MCC and Trinidad at the Queen's Park Oval across both tours. Then, on February 20, 1913, the MCC played a combined [[West Indies cricket team]], who were playing one of their earliest matches as a representative eleven, and only their fourth against an MCC side.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/1/1356/First-Class_Matches.html | title=First-Class Matches Played By West Indies | publisher=Cricket Archive| accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> [[Harry Ince]] scored 167 in the West Indian first innings, [[Richard Ollivierre]] took a five-wicket haul and [[Joseph Rogers]] took a six-for as the MCC slid to a heavy defeat. The match was the first between the West Indies and the MCC to have taken place at the Queen's Park Oval.<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/8/8939.html | title=West Indies v Marylebone Cricket Club Marylebone Cricket Club in West Indies 1912/13 | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> Though cricket was largely interrupted by the [[First World War]], normal practice resumed with the ground hosting the Inter-Colonial Tournament finals in 1921, 1925 and 1929.<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" />

===Test matches===

On February 1, 1930, the Queen's Park Oval hosted its first Test match. The second Test of the MCC 1929<U+2013>30 tour of the West Indies saw England under [[Les Ames]] defeat the West Indies under [[Errol Hunte]] thanks largely to a century by the England captain and a double-century by [[Patsy Hendren]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/13/13366.html | title=West Indies v England Marylebone Cricket Club in West Indies 1929/30 (2nd Test) | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> The ground also hosted the Second Test of the 1935 tour, which started on January 24. This time the West Indies recorded their first Test match victory at the ground, defeating [[Bob Wyatt]]'s England by 217 runs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/15/15287.html | title=West Indies v England Marylebone Cricket Club in West Indies 1934/35 (2nd Test) | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> In between the Tests the ground had also hosted several of the first-class matches of the tour, as well as continuing to host matches of the Inter-Colonial Tournament, including the 1935 and 1937 finals.<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" />

The outbreak of the [[Second World War]] halted Test cricket at the ground after this 1935 tour, however domestic cricket continued. 1939 represented the last year of the Inter-Colonial Tournament, and throughout the war years the Queen's Park Oval hosted several first-class games between Trinidad and either Barbados or British Guiana. International cricket would not return to the ground until 1947 when the MCC returned and played Trinidad twice at the ground in the lead up to the first post-war Test at the Queen's Park Oval on February 11, 1948. England drew with the West Indies - under [[Clyde Walcott]] - despite centuries from both West Indian openers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/18/18372.html | title=West Indies v England Marylebone Cricket Club in West Indies 1947/48 (2nd Test) | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> In 1952 the original pavilion was replaced with a two-tier structure as part of an extensive renovation of the ground.<ref name="cricpro" /> In 1953 [[India national cricket team|India]] toured the West Indies and played the First and Third Tests at the ground. The Oval then hosted England once more, on May 17, 1954, and the home team scored 681/8d, which remains the highest team score at the ground.<ref name="stats.espncricinfo">{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/team/highest_innings_totals.html?class=1;id=208;type=ground | title=Records / Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad / Test matches / Highest totals | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref> [[Everton Weekes]] scored 206 of the runs, the second of two double centuries scored by him at the Oval, following a knock of 207 during the aforementioned tour by India.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/30/1791/t_Centuries.html | title=Centuries Scored At The Queen's Park Oval | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=22 December 2013}}</ref> This was the final match played on the clay surface with matting laid on top.

(1991) p. xv.</ref> Later that year the ground hosted the second Test of an Australian tour.<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" /> Pakistan came in 1957, followed by England two years later and then India once more in 1961. The ground hosted two Tests of the series on each occasion.<ref name="Test Matches Played At The Queen's Park Oval">{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/30/1791_t.html | title=Test Matches Played At The Queen's Park Oval | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref>

The [[Beaumont Cup]] competition was held at the Queen's Park Oval from 1958 onwards, and from 1964 the [[Regional Four Day Competition]] also began, with the ground hosting Trinidad home games for both competitions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/313447.html | title=First-class domestic competitons | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> Australia returned to the ground in 1965 for the Second and Fifth Tests of the tour.

===West Indian ascendency===
[[File:Curtly ambrose2 crop.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Curtly Ambrose]] holds the record for the most wickets taken at the Queen's Park Oval, sixty-six.]]
The West Indian's had begun to experience difficulties in the final years of the 1960s. The Indian defeat had come on the back of defeats away to Australia and England. Though they played well against Australia on the 1972<U+2013>73 tour, they lost 2:1.<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" /> In the Fourth Test in [[Guyana]] they fell to a ten-wicket defeat after being dismissed for 109 in their second innings.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63103.html | title=The Frank Worrell Trophy - 4th Test - Test no. 720 - 1972/73 season | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> The utilisation of aggressive fast bowlers such as [[Dennis Lillee]] and [[Jeff Thomson]] had inspired West Indian captain to bring into his team men of similar virtues.<ref>{{cite AV media | title=Fire in Babylon | publisher=Cowboy Films, E & G Productions, ECN Motion Pictures | date=22 July 2011 (USA) | medium=Film | location=Bridgetown, Barbados}}</ref> In the 1976 Indian tour of the West Indies, the Queen's Park Oval hosted the Second and Third Tests.

Meanwhile in domestic cricket, the Beaumont Cup had been renamed the Texaco Cup, and both it and the Shell Shield continued to feature at the Queen's Park Oval.<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" /> The first [[List-A|one day cricket matches]] had begun in the West Indies, and the Queen's Park Oval hosted its inaugural [[Gillette Cup (West Indies)|Gillette Cup]] match between Trinidad and Tobago and the [[Windward Islands cricket team|Windward Islands]] in February, 1976.<ref name="List-A Matches Played At The Queen's Park Oval">{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/30/1791_a.html | title=List-A Matches Played At The Queen's Park Oval | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> Several of these games would be hosted at the ground each season.

Pakistan toured the West Indies in 1977, by which time the hosts were becoming a major force in world cricket.

===West Indian decline, 2007 World Cup===

By the late 1990s the West Indian team had begun to decline. They were defeated by Australia in a 1994<U+2013>95 series, the Third Test of which was played at the Queen's Park Oval,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/60/60360.html | title=West Indies v Australia Australia in West Indies and Bermuda 1994/95 (3rd Test) | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> as were two of the ODI matches.<ref name="List-A Matches Played At The Queen's Park Oval" /> The ground hosted two Tests of the 1997<U+2013>98 tour by England, the second of which in February saw the West Indies defeated by England.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/65/65367.html | title=West Indies v England England in West Indies 1997/98 (3rd Test) | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> The West Indian captain during the match, [[Brian Lara]], went on to be the leading run scorer at the Queen's Park Oval in ODI matches, as well as hold record for the highest score made there.<ref name="stats.espncricinfo_g">{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?class=2;id=208;type=ground | title=Records / Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad / One-Day Internationals / Most runs | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref><ref name="stats.espncricinfo_h">{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_innings.html?class=2;id=208;type=ground | title=Records / Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad / One-Day Internationals / High scores | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref> The West Indies lost heavily again to Australia at the ground in 1999, by a margin of 312 runs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/67/67341.html | title=West Indies v Australia Australia in West Indies 1998/99 (1st Test) | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> This, the opening Test of the series, set the tone for a five-nil whitewash of the host team by the visiting Australians.

The West Indies were chosen as hosts for the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]], with the Queen's Park Oval selected as one of the venues. Renovation work commenced immediately to prepare the ground for the matches. These, however, suffered drawbacks. Labour shortages hampered the efforts of the construction workers. Two new stands at the Queen's Park Oval were constructed for the event. Initially the [[International Cricket Council]] expressed concerns that the ground would not be ready in time, with Development Director Don Lockerbie stating that "that the ante had to be upped."<ref name="ICC inspector concerned with progress in Trinidad">{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/279569.html | title=ICC inspector concerned with progress in Trinidad | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | date=February 8, 2007 | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> An earthquake in late February that measured 5.1 on the [[Richter scale]] caused damaged to the fledgling stands.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/281808.html | title=Earthquake shakes Antigua and Trinidad | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | date=February 27, 2007 | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> Work which had due to be completed by December 2006 dragged into the spring of the following year, with opening matches of the competition due to start in March. Nevertheless the new pavilion was unveiled in time for the matches. The ground was celebrated as "the only venue in the West Indies, and one of four in the world to host more than 50 Test matches and 51 ODIs" during a ceremony to open the new stands.<ref name="espncricinfo">{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/279573.html | title=Queen's Park Oval pavilion unveiled | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | date=February 8, 2007 | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> Once the tournament had gotten underway, several Group B matches were played at the Queen's Park Oval between teams such as [[Bermuda cricket team|Bermuda]], India, [[Bangladesh cricket team|Bangladesh]] and [[Sri Lanka cricket team|Sri Lanka]]. These matches included a score of 413/5 by India against Bermuda on March 19, which remains the highest total made in an ODI at the Queen's Park Oval.<ref name="stats.espncricinfo_f">{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/team/highest_innings_totals.html?class=2;id=208;type=ground | title=Records / Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad / One-Day Internationals / Highest totals | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref> None of the final stage games were played at the ground, with the Super Eight stages all being played at either the [[Providence Stadium]] or the [[Sir Vivian Richards Stadium]].

===Post-World Cup years===
[[File:Queen's Park Oval 2004.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stands and the scoreboard at the Oval in 2004.]]
Following the end of the World Cup, the Queen's Park Oval began to feature international cricket only sporadically. Between 2005 and 2008 it did not host a Test match, and it only featured one in 2008 and another - against England - in 2009. It did not host an ODI in 2009, and only had two played at the ground for the entirely of 2008.<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" /><ref name="List-A Matches Played At The Queen's Park Oval" /> In 2009 it did host its first Twenty20 International, against England as a one-off match on March 15. The hosts defeated England comfortably thanks largely to a score of 59 from 46 balls by [[Ramnaresh Sarwan]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/175/175378.html | title=West Indies v England England in West Indies 2008/09 (Only Twenty20) | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> which leaves him to date the highest scorer and most prolific run-maker at the ground in T20 Internationals.<ref name="stats.espncricinfo_i">{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?class=3;id=208;type=ground | title=Records / Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad / Twenty20 Internationals / Most runs | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref><ref name="stats.espncricinfo_j">{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_innings.html?class=3;id=208;type=ground | title=Records / Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad / Twenty20 Internationals / High scores | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref>

The ground hosted another Twenty20 International against Zimbabwe in February 2010. Beyond this, however international cricket at the Queen's Park Oval grew more and more infrequent.<ref name="Twenty20 Matches Played At The Queen's Park Oval">{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/30/1791_tt.html | title=Twenty20 Matches Played At The Queen's Park Oval | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> The ground was not allotted any Test matches for the entire of 2011, a decision which prompted a reaction from Trinidad and Tobago Cricket Association President Azim Bassarath, who stated that "we in T&T need to have Test matches here so that our young and developing players can get a taste of the best form of the game."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/494136.html | title=T&T disappointed at not hosting Tests | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | date=December 26, 2010 | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> Since 2009 only two Test matches have been played at the stadium, the most recent being in April 2012 against Australia, and there has not been an ODI match played there since June 2011. The ground does continue to host domestic competitions,<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" /><ref name="List-A Matches Played At The Queen's Park Oval" /> and following the creation of the [[Caribbean Premier League]] it was host to several league matches of the [[2013 Caribbean Premier League|inaugural season]], including the final. It is home to the [[Trinidad and Tobago Red Steel]] CPL team.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/639249.html | title=Caribbean Premier League squads finalised | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | date=June 6, 2013 | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> It remains a popular stadium, described "as the most picturesque of the old grounds in the West Indies&nbsp;... a classic ground with breathtaking backdrops."<ref name="cricpro" />

==Facilities and pitch==
Since the 2007 renovation, the Oval has enjoyed the provision of new facilities and buildings. According to a CricInfo review of the new ground on the eve of the World Cup, it featured a "library and museum space on the ground floor, as well as a top class health, spa, gymnasium and restaurant facilities, and an entertainment centre with satellite TV and other comforts."<ref name="espncricinfo" /> The ground has a crown capacity of 28,000 and is supported by floodlights. In addition to the "Learie Constantine Stand", known in particular for its jovial crowds,<ref name="cricpro" /> there is the Trini Posse which perpendicular to the pitch, the Carib Stand, Errol Dos Santos Stand, and the Brian Lara Pavilion, the latter named for the West Indian batsman.

The pitch has two ends, the Pavilion End and Media Centre End. Mole crickets caused too much damage on the original pitch which was laid directly onto the natural soil, so soon after the ground was purchased a pitch of clay was laid over a wicket made of [[coir]] matting.<ref name="cricpro" /><ref>Pervez (2001) p. 50.</ref> A 1932 study into cricket pitches ruled that clay pitches lacking in [[calcium carbonate]] were ideal for cricket play.<ref name="Gumbs1991" /> However, the Queen's Park Oval clay surface was disproportionately suited to batting. A score of 681/8d in 1954, and double-centuries by Everton Weekes in consecutive series during that same year, prompted the laying of a turf wicket in 1955 in an attempt to balance batting and bowling.<ref name="Gumbs1991" /> Five 20-metre-wide and 26-metre-long pitches were dug, each with a depth of one meter.<ref name="Gumbs1991" />

The work was supported by a second study in 1962, made in Australia, which argued that such turf wickets were more likely to lead to balanced cricket games.<ref name="Gumbs1991" /> Between the Oval's inaugural Test and January 1954, the overall [[batting average]] at the ground was 37.03, and it dropped to 28.07 between the installation of the new pitch and the year 2000.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;ground=208;groupby=overall;orderby=runs;spanmax1=01+Jan+2000;spanmin1=01+Jan+1955;spanval1=span;template=results;type=batting | title=Statistics / Statsguru / Test matches / Batting records / QPA runs scored 1955-2000 | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=30 January 2014}}</ref> Even the new pitch was however, according to a 1982 report, "well known of its peculiar playing characteristics."<ref name="Gumbs1991" /> It crumbled during matches, giving more help to [[spin bowling|spin bowlers]].<ref name="Gumbs1991" /> Australian Test bowler [[Ashley Mallett]] believed that the new pitch was certainly more helpful to spin bowling,<ref>{{cite book | title=One of a Kind: The Doug Walters Story | publisher=ReadHowYouWant.com | author=Mallet, Ashley | year=2010 | pages=285 | isbn=1459603648}}</ref> while England captain [[Nasser Hussain]] was negative about batting on the pitch during the 2004 England tour in his biography ''Playing With Fire''.<ref name="Hussain2004" /> In 2012 the pitch was described by the media during the Australian tour as "slightly damp, tacky appearance" after rain, and then "tinder-dry."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/west-indies-v-australia-2012/content/story/561279.html | title=Parched Queen's Park Oval pitch likened to Kanpur | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | date=April 15, 2012 | accessdate=30 January 2014 | author=Brettig, Daniel}}</ref>
