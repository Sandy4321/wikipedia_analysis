Heskey started his career with [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in 1996. He then made a <U+00A3>11 million move to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in [[2000]], which was a record transfer fee paid by the club. At the club, he won multiple honours, including an [[FA Cup]] win in [[2001]]. He then moved to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in [[2004]] and moved to current club Wigan Athletic in [[2006]].

Heskey is a former [[England national football team|England]] international. He made his international debut against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in in a 1-1 draw in [[1999]]. He went on to gain a total of 43 [[cap (sport)|caps]] and score 5 goals for the team, making his final appearence against [[France national football team|France]] in Euro 2004, during which he failed to shine and was the subject of much criticism.

==Career==
===Leicester City===
Heskey started his career at home-town club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], where he made league debut against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in [[1995]] at the age of 17.<ref name="Emile Heskey football heroes 2">{{cite news

During this season, Heskey scored his first goal as a professional [[football (soccer)|footballer]], which came in a 1-0 victory of [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], in a season he managed to score a total of seven goals.<ref name="Emile Heskey football heroes 1">{{cite news

| publisher = Football-heroes
| accessdate = 2007-07-04}}</ref>

During the [[1996-97 in English football|1996<U+2013>97]], his first in the Premier League, Heskey managed to score 10 goals in 35 appearences in this league, and also scored the equaliser in the [[1997]] [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], which was won by Leicester in the replay.<ref name="Emile Heskey football heroes 1"/> The following season saw interest from [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for Heskey, as he again managed to net 10 Premier League goals. However, the [[1997-98 in English football|1997<U+2013>98]] season saw Heskey score only six top-flight goals, and had been critiscised for not scoring enough goals and going to ground too easily.<ref name="Emile Heskey football heroes 2"/>

In the [[1998-99 in English football|1998<U+2013>99]] season, Heskey forged an effective strike partnership with [[Tony Cottee]], who benefited from Heskey's unselfish style of play.<ref name="Emile Heskey football heroes 2"/> He went on to win the League Cup again in [[2000]] with a 2<U+2013>1 win against [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]].<ref name="11 Emile Heskey | Forward"/>

===Liverpool===
Heskey joined [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in [[March]] [[2000]] in a long-anticipated <U+00A3>11m move, which, at the time, set the record transfer fee for the [[Merseyside]] club.<ref name="Heskey shrugs off record fee">{{cite news

Heskey made his home debut in the [[Premier League]] clash with [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] and played well, but the season finished with continuing doubts about his goalscoring prowess.<ref name="11 Emile Heskey | Forward">{{cite web

===Birmingham City===
At the end of the [[FA Premier League 2003-04|2003<U+2013>04]] season, Heskey signed for [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] for an initial fee of <U+00A3>3.5m, which could rise to <U+00A3>6.25m,<ref name="Birmingham sign Heskey">{{cite news

Despite Birmingham's mediocre [[2004-05 in English football|2004<U+2013>05]] season, Heskey won four club awards at the end of the season - Player's Player of the Season, Fan's Player of the Season, Top Goalscorer (11) and most [[Man of the Match|Man of the Match Awards]]. Birmingham's poor [[2005-06 in English football|2005<U+2013>06]] season, during which Heskey scored only 4 goals in 34 league appearances, culminated in relegation to [[Football League Championship|The Championship]]. During this season, Heskey gave inconsistant performances and fans had started to get on his back.<ref name="11 Emile Heskey | Forward"/>

===Wigan Athletic===
Heskey was signed by [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] for <U+00A3>5.5m during the summer of [[2006]].<ref name="Wigan seal <U+00A3>5.5m move for Heskey">{{cite news

Throughout the [[Premier League 2006-07|2006<U+2013>07]] season Heskey became a popular figure amongst the Wigan faithful. He showed great endeavour, although not always matched by goals. Nonetheless, his undoubted strength and presence proved vital and managed to score 8 goals, helping Wigan avoid relegation on goals difference from [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], against whom Heskey proved to be a handful for Wigan on [[13 May]] [[2007]], where he nearly scored an overhead kick.<ref name="Sheff Utd 1-2 Wigan">{{cite news

Heskey made his debut for the senior [[England national football team|England]] team in a friendly against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in [[Budapest]] in a 1-1 draw in [[1999]] and made his first start against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in [[2000]].<ref name="England Players"/> That showing ensured he was in the England squad for the [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2000]] tournament.<ref name="Emile Heskey bbc">{{cite web

Within minutes he had given away a free kick (which France equalised from) and England lost 2-1. Heskey was recalled into the England squad for the World Cup qualifiers against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] in 2005, after having being dropped following the game against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] in August 2005.<ref name="Bruce ecstatic over Heskey recall">{{cite news
