'''Bo Xilai''' (born 3 July 1949) is a Chinese politician.  He came to prominence through his tenures as the mayor of the coastal economic hub of [[Dalian]] and then governor of [[Liaoning]] province. From 2004 to November 2007, he served as [[Minister of Commerce (People's Republic of China)|Minister of Commerce]]. Between 2007 and 2012 he served as a member of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] and head of the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party's]] [[Chongqing]] branch.

The son of [[Bo Yibo]], one of the [[Eight Elders]] of the Communist Party of China, Bo Xilai is identified as one of the "[[princeling]]s" of Chinese politics. He cultivated a casual and charismatic image in the media that marked a departure from the normally staid nature of Chinese politics.

In Chongqing, Bo became known for heavy-handed [[populism]]. He initiated a [[Chongqing gang trials|campaign against organized crime]], increased spending on welfare programs, maintained consistent double-digit percentage GDP growth, and campaigned to revive [[Cultural Revolution]]-era "red culture." Bo's promotion of [[egalitarian]] values and the achievements of his "Chongqing model" made him the champion of the [[Chinese New Left]], composed of both [[Maoism|Maoists]] and [[social democrat]]s disillusioned with the country's market-based economic reforms and increasing economic inequality.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/18832046 'The princelings are coming'], ''The Economist'', 23 June 2011.</ref> However, the perceived lawlessness of Bo's anti-corruption campaigns, coupled with concerns about his outsized personality, made him a controversial figure. 

Bo was considered a likely candidate for promotion to the elite [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] in [[18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|CPC 18th National Congress]] in 2012. His political fortunes came to an abrupt end following the [[Wang Lijun incident]], in which his top lieutenant and police chief sought asylum at the American consulate in [[Chengdu]] and revealed details of Bo's alleged involvement in a homicide plot. In the fallout, Bo was removed as Chongqing [[CPC party chief|party chief]] in March 2012 and suspended from the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|politburo]] the following month. Bo's dismissal was notable for exposing disunity within Communist Party ranks shortly before a leadership transition.

==Early life==
Bo Xilai was the fourth child of prominent Communist Party leader [[Bo Yibo]], who served as [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China|Minister of Finance]] in the early years of the People's Republic of China but who fell from favor in 1965 for supporting more open trade relations with the West. When the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, Bo Yibo was labeled a "rightist" and a "counterrevolutionary" and purged from his posts.<ref name=obit>Kahn, Joseph [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/16/world/asia/16iht-obits.4228059.html "Bo Yibo, leader who helped reshape China's economy, dies"], ''International Herald Tribute'', 16 January 1997.</ref> He spent the ensuing twelve years in prison, where he was reportedly tortured. His wife, Hu Ming, was abducted by [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]] in [[Guangzhou]], and was either beaten to death or committed suicide.<ref name=Garnaut/>

Bo Xilai was 17 years old when the Cultural Revolution began, and at the time attended the prestigious No. 4 High School in Beijing <U+2014> one of the best in the country.<ref name=Garnaut>Garnaut, John [http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/03/29/the_revenge_of_wen_jiabao?page=full "The Revenge of Wen Jiabao"], ''Foreign Policy'', 29 March 2012.</ref><ref name=NRS/> In the early years of the Cultural Revolution, Bo is reported to have been an active member of the ''liandong'' Red Guard organization<ref name=NRS/><ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/66B76VL6m <U+4E2D><U+5171><U+63A5><U+73ED><U+7FA4><U+4E4B><U+4E00><U+8584><U+7199><U+6765><U+7684><U+653F><U+6CBB><U+52A8><U+5411>].

Wikileaks, 4 December 2007.</ref>

As the political winds of the Cultural Revolution shifted, Bo and his siblings were either imprisoned or sent to the countryside, and Bo Xilai was locked up for five years.<ref>Zhang, Wenxian; Alon, Ilan "Biographical dictionary of new Chinese entrepreneurs and business leaders," Edward Elgar Publishing, Inc, (2009). ISBN 978-1-84720-636-7.</ref> After the death of [[Mao Zedong]] in 1976, the members of the [[Gang of Four]] were officially blamed for the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, and Bo's family was released. Bo Yibo was politically rehabilitated, and in 1979 became [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|vice premier]].<ref name=obit/>

After his release, Bo Xilai worked at the Hardware Repair Factory for the Beijing Second Light Industry Bureau.<ref>specifically, 1972<U+2013>78: http://www.chinavitae.com/biography/Bo_Xilai/career</ref> He was admitted to the [[Peking University]] by [[Gaokao|public examination]] in 1977. Unlike many of his contemporaries in the Chinese leadership who studied engineering, Bo majored in world history.<ref name=SecretFiles/> In his sophomore year, Bo enlisted in a Master's program in international journalism at the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]],<ref name=NRS/> graduating with a Master's degree in 1982.<ref name=ChinaVitae/> He joined the Communist Party in October 1980.<ref name=ChinaVitae>China Vitae, [http://www.chinavitae.com/biography/72 Bo Xilai].</ref>

==Early political career==
During the 1980s, the Bo family regained its political influence. Bo Yibo served successively as vice premier and vice-chairman of the [[Central Advisory Commission]]. The elder Bo came to be known as one of the <U+201C>eight elders<U+201D> (sometimes referred to as the <U+201C>eight immortals<U+201D>) of the Communist Party and was instrumental in the implementation of [[Chinese economic reform|market reforms]] in the 1980s. Although he favored more liberal economic policies, the elder Bo was politically conservative, and endorsed the use of military force against demonstrators during the [[1989 Tiananmen Square Protests]].<ref name=obit/>  After the 1989 crackdown, Bo Yibo helped ensure the ascent of [[Jiang Zemin]] to succeed [[Deng Xiaoping]] as the leader of the Party and helped Jiang consolidate power in the 1990s.<ref name=SecretFiles/> Bo Yibo remained a prominent figure in the party until his death in 2007<ref name=obit/> and was influential in shaping his son's career.<ref name=Finkelstein/> 

After graduating from university, Bo was assigned to [[Zhongnanhai]]<ref name=SecretFiles/> <U+2013> the headquarters of the Communist Party <U+2013> where he worked with the research office of the [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|CPC Central Committee Secretariat]] and [[General Office of the Communist Party of China|CPC Central Committee General Office]].<ref name=NRS/> He soon requested a transfer to the provinces, and in 1984 was appointed deputy party secretary of [[Jinzhou District|Jin County]], near [[Dalian]] in the northeastern province of Liaoning.<ref name=SecretFiles/><ref name=ChinaVitae/> In an interview with ''[[People<U+2019>s Daily]]'', Bo said that his family name created career obstacles. "For quite a long time people had reservations about me," he said.<ref name=Finkelstein>Finkelstein, David Michael; Kivlehan, Maryanne <U+201C>''China's leadership in the 21st century: the rise of the fourth generation''<U+201D> (East Gate, 2003).</ref> Bo subsequently became deputy secretary and then secretary of the party committee of the Dalian Economic and Technological Development Zone and secretary of the [[Jinzhou]] party committee.<ref name=ChinaVitae/>

Rising again in rank within the party, he became a member of the Standing Committee of the Dalian Municipal CPC Committee, the city's top decision-making body, and became the Vice-mayor of Dalian in 1990.<ref name=ChinaVitae/> In 1993, Bo became deputy Party secretary and mayor of Dalian.<ref name=SecretFiles/>

==Liaoning==
===Mayor of Dalian===
[[Image:Star ocean square <U+5927><U+9023>.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Dalian]] saw significant development under Bo's leadership.]]
Bo became acting mayor of [[Dalian]] in 1992 and formally assumed the post in 1993. He remained mayor until 2000. Bo served as Dalian's deputy party secretary from 1995.<ref name=ChinaVitae/>  Bo was promoted to [[CPC party chief|party chief]] in 1999 and served in that position until 2000.

Bo's tenure in Dalian was marked by the city's phenomenal transformation from a drab port city to a modern [[metropolis]], a 'showcase' of China's rapid economic growth.<ref name=bw1>{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Dexter|title=China: A Princeling Who Could Be Premier|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_11/b3874075.htm|accessdate=5 April 2012|newspaper=BusinessWeek|date=15 March 2004}}</ref> In the early 1990s, Bo took some credit for the construction of the [[Shenda highway|Shenyang-Dalian Expressway]], China's first [[expressways of China|controlled-access freeway]], winning accolades for the rapid expansion of infrastructure and for environmental work.<ref name=clm>{{cite web|last=Naughton|first=Barry|title=Hunkering Down: The Wen Jiabao Administration and Macroeconomic Recontrol|url=http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/clm11_bn.pdf|work=China Leadership Monitor|publisher=Hoover Foundation|accessdate=5 April 2012}}</ref> Since Bo's time in office, Dalian became known as one of the cleanest cities in China, having won the [[UN Habitat Scroll of Honour Award#1999 WINNERS|UN Habitat Scroll of Honour Award]] in 1999. In addition, Bo was an advocate for free enterprise and small businesses, and successfully courted foreign investment from [[South Korea]], Japan, and Western countries.<ref name=bw1/> In contrast to his colleagues, he held press conferences at Chinese New Year, and developed a reputation among foreign investors for 'getting things done'.<ref name=clm/>

Bo spent seventeen years in the city of Dalian, a lengthy term in comparison to colleagues of the same rank, who are often transferred to different locales throughout their careers. Despite the accompanying economic growth and rise in living standards, Bo's tenure in Dalian has sometimes been criticized as having been too focused on aesthetic development projects such as expansive boulevards, monuments, and large public parks.<ref name=clm/> To make way for his large-scale projects, Bo's administration moved large numbers of local residents from downtown areas into new homes in the city's outskirts. Dalian's greenery was dubbed "Xilai Grass".<ref name=clt/> He also reputedly had a remote control in the Mayor's office for the fountains on the city's main square.<ref name=mail>{{cite news|last=Parry|first=Simon|title=How the playboy antics of Chinese politician's Harrow-educated son have fuelled rumours of a coup in Beijing|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2119940/Bo-Xilais-son-Bo-Guaguas-playboy-lifestyle-fuelled-rumours-Beijing-coup.html|accessdate=16 April 2012|newspaper=The Daily Mail|date=25 March 2012}}</ref>  In addition, he spearheaded the construction of a ''[[huabiao]]'' in the city.<ref name=yazhou>{{cite news|title=<U+4E9A><U+6D32><U+5468><U+520A><U+FF1A><U+8584><U+7199><U+6765><U+65E9><U+6709><U+50ED><U+8D8A><U+4E4B><U+5FC3> (''Asia Weekly'': Bo's ambitions began Early)|url=http://opinion.dwnews.com/news/2012-04-15/58703114.html|accessdate=16 April 2012|newspaper=Yazhou Zhoukan (Asia Weekly)|date=15 April 2012}}</ref> In 2000, Bo was frontrunner for the post of Mayor of [[Shenzhen]], based on his success in making Dalian the "Hong Kong of the North".  However it was suggested that Bo was too independent and outspoken for the post. The post went to [[Yu Youjun]] instead.<ref name=SCMP> Switched face raises eyebrows, [[SCMP]], [[Willy Lam]], edition 4 May 2000</ref>

===15th Party Congress===

During the 15th Party Congress in 1997, Bo Xilai<U+2019>s family launched an unsuccessful campaign to secure his promotion to become a member of the [[Central Committee of the CCP]]. Although [[nepotism]] was generally frowned upon in China, [[Bo Yibo]]<U+2019>s ambitions for his son were well-known.<ref name=clt>{{cite book|last=Li|first=Cheng|title=China's leaders: the new generation|year=2001|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=0847694976|pages=166}}</ref> Bo Yibo advanced the idea that revolutionary elders should 'nominate' their children to become high officials, and Bo Xilai was selected as his family<U+2019>s 'representative' over his older brother Bo Xicheng,<ref name=clt/> ostensibly because of Xilai<U+2019>s superior academic credentials, which included attendance at the elite Peking University and a master<U+2019>s degree. 

In order to secure Bo Xilai<U+2019>s selection for promotion during the 15th Party Congress, the family launched a nationwide campaign to publicize his son<U+2019>s "achievements" as mayor of Dalian.<ref name=clt/> They commissioned author Chen Zufeng to pen a report portraying Bo as a man who is "as statesman-like as [[Henry Kissinger]], as environmentally conscious as [[Al Gore]], and almost as beloved by the public as [[Princess Diana]]."<ref name=clt/> Despite the publicity campaign, Bo Xilai failed even to gain a seat in the Liaoning provincial delegation to the Party Congress. Ultimately, Bo Yibo helped him gain a seat with the [[Shanxi]] delegation, but the younger Bo was unable to secure a promotion.<ref name=clt/> 

In addition, Bo placed second-last in the confirmation vote for membership in the [[15th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|15th Central Committee]]. As he placed in the bottom 5% of candidates, Bo was denied entry into the elite council, suffering a major political embarrassment.<ref name=NRS/> Bo's failure to get elected was attributed to a general opposition to nepotism within the Party.<ref name=clt/> Moreover, during his tenure in Dalian, Bo caused resentment for the amount of 'special favours' that he procured for the coastal city at the expense of the rest of the province.<ref name="clt"/> His perceived partisan interests locked Bo's kin in a factional struggle against [[Li Tieying]], one of China's central leadership figures, who may have created obstacles to his promotion.<ref name=clt/>

===Provincial Governor===
In 2001, a corruption scandal involving former Liaoning governor [[Zhang Guoguang]] provided an opportunity for Bo's advancement.<ref name=clm/> Prior to the 15th Party Congress, Bo Yibo and Bo Xilai assisted then-President [[Jiang Zemin]] in preparing to force political rival [[Qiao Shi]] into retirement. The Bo family also supported Jiang's lacklustre "Three Stresses" (''San Jiang'') campaign in 1997.<ref name=SecretFiles/> Such unwavering support for Jiang was said to have worked in Bo Xilai's favour when the vacancy for Governor of Liaoning opened. Bo became acting Governor in 2001 after the dismissal and arrest of Zhang Guoguang,<ref name=SecretFiles>Nathan, Andrew J.; Gilley, Bruce "China's new rulers: the secret files," New York Review of Books (2003).</ref> and was officially confirmed as Governor in 2003.<ref name=ChinaVitae/> In his position as governor, which he held until 2004, Bo gained membership to the Central Committee of the Communist Party.<ref name=NRS/>

During his tenure in Liaoning, Bo played a critical role in the promotion of the [[Northeast Area Revitalization Plan]]. Adopted in 2003 by party authorities, the policy aimed to strengthen economic development in the provinces of Liaoning, [[Jilin]] and [[Heilongjiang]]. Bo Xilai was particularly enthusiastic about the policy, stating his desire to see the northeast become "China's fourth economic engine" (the others being the [[Pearl River Delta]], [[Yangtze River Delta]], and the [[Bohai]] Economic Region).<ref name=NRS>Cheng Li, [http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/clm9_lc.pdf "China<U+2019>s Northeast: From Largest Rust Belt to Fourth Economic Engine?<U+201D>], ''China Leadership Monitor'', No. 9.</ref> 

The [[Northeast China|northeast region]] was at one time known as the "cradle of industrialization" of China. In 1980, industrial output for Liaoning province alone was twice that of the southern [[Guangdong]] province. However, the northeast was left behind amidst market reforms of the 1980s and 1990s, while regions like Guangdong prospered. Its economy<U+2014>still largely tied to state-owned enterprises<U+2014>stagnated relative to other regions, with high unemployment rates.<ref name=NRS/> The revitalisation plan aimed to address this by reviving the region<U+2019>s traditional industries, strengthening trade ties with and encouraging investment from South Korea and Japan, and experimenting with free trade zones in select cities.<ref>Calder, Kent; Ye, Min <U+201C>''The Making of Northeast Asia''<U+201D> (Stanford University Press, 2010).</ref> In 2004, official media reported that foreign direct investment in Liaoning had nearly doubled since the launch in 2003 of the northeastern rejuvenation strategy.<ref>Pan, Letian (19 October 2004) [http://english.gov.cn/2004-10/19/content_23754.htm "FDI inflow almost doubles in Liaoning"], ''China Daily''.</ref>

Although Bo established a reputation as a comparatively clean politician during his tenures in Dalian and as governor of Liaoning,<ref>China Labor Bulletin, [http://www.clb.org.hk/en/node/3580 "Liaoning Province <U+2013> An overview"]</ref> he was not immune to corruption allegations. In particular, Bo was the subject of critical investigative reports by Liaoning journalist [[Jiang Weiping]],<ref name="Corruption1">Pan, Philip P.  "[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/03/AR2006010301371.html China Releases Investigative Reporter Whose Jailing Had Upset U.S.]", ''The Washington Post'', 4 January 2006.

[[Falun Gong]] practitioners and their supporters have accused Bo of torture, and for leading a harsh crackdown on the group during his tenure in Liaoning.<ref>Jamil Anderlini, [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b168c3ba-6eac-11e1-b1b2-00144feab49a.html#axzz1uoe20KDz Downfall ends Bo<U+2019>s ambition to rule China], ''Financial Times'', 15 March 2012.</ref> They have filed lawsuits against Bo and other Communist Party leaders in over ten countries.<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2005/11/30/2003282362/3 "Spain: genocide case rejected"], ''Taipei Times'', 30 November 2005. accessed 8 February 2012.</ref><ref>U.S. Department of State, [http://www.state.gov/s/l/c24878.htm Digest of United States Practice in International Law 2006]</ref><ref name=jamil/> Only in one instance was Falun Gong successful: Bo found liable in an uncontested civil case filed by a Falun Gong practitioner in Australia in 2007; a legal scholar noted that Bo may enjoy immunity under the Foreign States Immunities Act of 1985.<ref>Rowan Callick, [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/legal-affairs/chinese-minister-guilty-of-torture/story-e6frg97x-1111114833735 Chinese minister guilty of torture], ''The Australian'', 9 November 2007.</ref>

===16th Party Congress===
At the [[16th Party Congress]] in 2002, Bo's age, regional tenures, and patronage links fit the profile for a potential candidate to be groomed for the "[[Generations of Chinese leadership|5th generation of leaders]]" that would assume power in 2012. His chief competitors were seen as [[Xi Jinping]], then party chief in the coastal province of [[Zhejiang]], and [[Li Keqiang]], a populist ''[[Tuanpai]]'' candidate who was the Governor of the central province of [[Henan]].<ref name=SecretFiles/> As with the 15th Party Congress five years earlier, the elder Bo lobbied for his son's promotion.<ref name=SecretFiles/> The Bo family enjoyed the patronage of Jiang Zemin. However, Bo Xilai's unequivocal support for Jiang strengthened the reluctance of his political opponents to support his nomination. Ultimately, although Bo remained a top contender for higher promotion, Xi and Li remained the main candidates to succeed Hu Jintao as [[Paramount leader]].<ref name=SecretFiles/>

==Minister of Commerce==
[[File:US Secretary Gutierrez meets with Chinese Minister Bo Xilai.jpg|thumb|Commerce Minister Bo meets his American counterpart, [[Carlos Gutierrez]], during a visit to the United States in 2007]]
When [[Hu Jintao]] succeeded Jiang Zemin as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] in late 2002, Bo's career as a local official ended with his appointment to Minister of Commerce in [[Wen Jiabao]]'s cabinet to replace [[L<U+00FC> Fuyuan]], who retired for health reasons. Bo concurrently served as a member of the 16th [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]].

Bo's stint as Minister of Commerce significantly raised his international profile and generated media attention both in China and abroad. Described as good-looking, articulate and open-minded in his approach to problems,<ref name="Ewing2">Ewing, Kent. (2010, 19 March).  "[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/LC19Ad01.html Bo Xilai: China's Brash Populist]".  ''Asia Times''.  Retrieved 16 June 2011.</ref> Bo's rise from a municipal official to the central government generated great media fanfare and elevated his status to something of a 'political star.' Bo's political persona was considered a departure from the generally serious and conservative leadership in Beijing. With his youthful vigour, populism, and purported popularity with female reporters, Bo's political rise had been compared to that of [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref name=hlm>{{cite news|last=Hou|first=Liming (ed.)|title=<U+8584><U+7199><U+6765><U+FF1A><U+98CE><U+53E3><U+6D6A><U+5C16><U+4E0A><U+7684>"<U+9B45><U+529B><U+90E8><U+957F>" (Bo Xilai: The Charming Minister)|url=http://finance.people.com.cn/GB/42774/3463563.html|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=International Financial Times |publisher=People.cn|date=13 June 2005}}</ref>

Bo presided over a continued rise in foreign investment in China as Minister of Commerce. His daily schedule was dominated by receiving foreign guests and dignitaries. By the time that he became Minister, he spoke relatively fluent and colloquial English. During a meeting with American officials, Bo reputedly told a struggling interpreter to stop translating because the Chinese officials could understand English and it was wasting time. In May 2004 Bo was one of the few ministers hand-picked to accompany Premier Wen Jiabao on a five-country trip to Europe.<ref name=hlm/> The trade policy of the United States toward China also sparked significant controversy. Bo maintained a conciliatory but assertive attitude as he attended talks in [[Washington D.C.|Washington]].<ref name=hlm/> On his trips to the United States, he conducted substantive discussions with his American counterparts and signed agreements on intellectual property, the services sector, agricultural products, food safety, and consumer protection.<ref name=hlm/>

Bo also oversaw the restructuring of the Ministry, formed from the amalgamation of the National Economics and Commerce Bureau and the Department of International Trade. Bo sought to balance the amount of attention given to foreign investors and domestic commercial institutions. He began tackling the imbalance from the retail sector, whose success up to that point was largely dependent on foreign companies.<ref name=hlm/> He drew up plans to protect Chinese industries' competitive position within a domestic market that was quickly being crowded out by foreign competition.<ref name=srw>{{cite web|title=<U+8D44><U+6599><U+FF1A><U+5546><U+52A1><U+90E8><U+90E8><U+957F><U+8584><U+7199><U+6765><U+7684><U+4E94><U+79CD><U+9762><U+5B54> (The Five Faces of Commerce Minister Bo Xilai)|date=15 March 2012|url=http://news.ifeng.com/mainland/detail_2012_03/15/13212560_0.shtml|work=Shidai Renwu Weekly |publisher=ifeng|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref>

===17th Party Congress===
At the [[17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|17th Party Congress]] in October 2007, Bo gained a seat on the 25-member Politburo, effectively China's ruling council. He was then tipped to leave the Ministry of Commerce and take over as [[Party chief of the Communist Party of China|party chief]] in the southwestern megalopolis of [[Chongqing]].

===The Chongqing model===
Although Bo was initially unhappy about his re-assignment in Chongqing, he soon resolved to use his new position as a staging ground for a return to higher national office.<ref> Karson Yiu and Enjoli Frances, [http://abcnews.go.com/International/chinas-mystery-bo-xilai-rise-fall-chinas-political/story?id=16163613#6 The Mysterious Saga of China<U+2019>s Bo Xilai], ABC News, 19 April 2012.</ref>  Bo made no secret of his desire to enter the nine-member [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC) during the [[18th Party Congress]] in autumn 2012,<ref name="Kent" /> all but two of the PSC members<U+2014>including President [[Hu Jintao]] and Premier [[Wen Jiabao]]<U+2014>were expected to retire.<ref name="Ewing2" /> The transition would be an opportunity for Bo to join the highest echelon of national leadership, likely as a replacement for ally [[Zhou Yongkang]], secretary of the [[Political and Legislative Affairs Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Political and Legislative Committee]], serving as the head of the party's security apparatus.<ref name="Kent" /><ref>The Economist, [http://www.economist.com/node/18832046 China's new leaders: the princelings are coming], 23 June 2011.</ref>

In Chongqing, Bo pioneered a new style of governance dubbed the "Chongqing Model<U+201D> <U+2014> a set of social and economic policies intended to address diverse challenges facing modern China following [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]].<ref name=Johnson>Ian Johnson, [http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2012/mar/19/chinas-falling-star-bo-xilai/ China<U+2019>s Falling Star], New York Review of Books, 19 March 2012.</ref><ref name=liu>{{cite news|last=Liu|first=Yawei|title=Bo Xilai's Campaign for the Standing Committee and the Future of Chinese Politicking|url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/chinabrief/single/?cHash=8400a753575726d6003e9fbe4f3ad780&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=38660&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=25|accessdate=15 March 2012|newspaper=The Jamestown Foundation|date=11 November 2011}}</ref>

The Chonqging model was characterized in part by increased state control and the promotion of a [[Chinese New Left|neo-leftist ideology]].  Along with his police chief Wang Lijun, Bo launched a sweeping campaign against organized crime, and increased the security and police presence in the city. Critics noted these policies were accompanied by the erosion of the rule of law, and allegations surfaced of political and personal rivals being victimized amidst Bo<U+2019>s anti-corruption drive.  As a means of addressing declining public morality, Bo launched a <U+201C>red culture<U+201D> movement to promote Maoist-era socialist ethics. On the economic front, he actively courted foreign investment<U+2014>much as he had done in Liaoning province.  The Chongqing model was also characterized by massive public works programs, subsidized housing for the poor, and social policies intended to make it easier for rural citizens to move to the city, thus reaping the benefits of urban status.<ref name=Johnson/>

The Chongqing model provided an 'alternate' comprehensive roadmap for development that diverged from the policies favored by the reformist faction dominated by Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao.<ref name=Johnson/>  Bo<U+2019>s leadership in Chongqing dramatically raised his profile, both nationally and internationally. In 2010, he was named as one of the 'World's 100 Most Influential People in 2010' by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]].''<ref name=time>{{cite news|title=The 2010 ''TIME'' 100: Bo Xilai|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1984685_1984864_1985416,00.html|accessdate=11 April 2012|newspaper=TIME|date=29 April 2010}}</ref> Observers noted that, in China's non-electoral political system, Bo's high-profile presence and bold political maneuvers effectively amounted to a public campaign for the top leadership.<ref name=lam2/>  However, he drew the ire of some of the country<U+2019>s leaders; President Hu and Premier Wen were reluctant to acknowledge Bo publicly, ostensibly due to a discomfort over his leadership style.<ref name=lam2>{{cite web|last=Lam|first=Willy|title=Xi Jinping's Chongqing Tour: Gang of Princelings Gains Clout|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=37293|publisher=Jamestown Foundation|accessdate=15 March 2012}}</ref> 

====Organized crime====
{{see also|Chongqing gang trials}}
Bo's tenure in Chongqing was dominated by a protracted war against organized crime and corruption known as ''dahei'' ("striking black"). Between 2009 and 2011, an estimated 5,700 people were arrested in the sweeping campaign that ensnared not only criminals, but also businessmen, members of the police force, judges, government officials, and political adversaries.<ref name=Lubman>Stanley Lubman, [http://www.law.berkeley.edu/13236.htm Bo Xilai<U+2019>s Gift to Chongqing: A Legal Mess], Wall Street Journal, 12 April 2012.</ref><ref name=Economist>{{cite news

[[Wen Qiang]] ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|<U+6587><U+5F3A>}}), one of the most prominent figures implicated in the trials, had been a prominent municipal official since the days of party chiefs [[He Guoqiang]] and Wang Yang.  China observer Willy Lam suggested that the such a large-scale crackdown was given 'go-ahead' from central authorities and general secretary, president [[Hu Jintao]], and Bo was careful to not look as though Chongqing was trying to 'set an example' for the rest of the country so he could benefit from the success politically.<ref name=Lam>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/cb_009_59.pdf

The ''dahei'' campaign earned Bo national recognition and widespread popularity in Chongqing<U+2014>all the more because of the city<U+2019>s historical reputation as a center for criminal activity.<ref name="Kent" /> In contrast to often colorless and orthodox politicians, Bo gained the reputation as a party boss that "got things done."<ref name=guard/> The apparent success of the campaign gave Bo a 'rock star status', and resulted in calls for a nation-wide campaign modeled on Chongqing. Through the campaign, Bo gained the support of a number of powerful members of the Politburo Standing Committee, including [[Wu Bangguo]],  [[Jia Qinglin]], [[Li Changchun]], [[Xi Jinping]] and [[Zhou Yongkang]], all of whom visited Chongqing or praised Bo's achievements sometime between 2010 and 2011.<ref name=liu/>

However, Bo's campaign was criticized for running roughshod over judicial [[due process]] and eroding the [[rule of law]].<ref name=Lubman/> Individuals targeted in the campaign were arbitrarily detained by the authorities, with an estimated 1,000 being sent to forced labor.<ref>Keith B.

====Red culture movement====
During his time in Chongqing, Bo initiated a series of Maoist-style campaigns to revive 'red culture' and improve public morale. The initiative included the promotion of Maoist quotes, 'red' songs, revolutionary television programing and operas, and initiatives to encourage students to work in the countryside, akin to the way students were required to do during the [[Down to the Countryside Movement]] of the Cultural Revolution.<ref>Branigan, Tania [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/22/red-songs-chinese-cultural-revolution Red songs ring out in Chinese city's new cultural revolution], ''The Guardian'', 22 April 2011.</ref> As part of the movement, Bo and the city's Media Department initiated a "Red Songs campaign" that demanded every district, government  department, commercial enterprise, educational institution, state radio and TV station begin singing 'red songs' praising the achievements of the Communist Party of China. Bo pledged to reinvigorate the city with the [[Marxist]] ideals reminiscent of the Mao era.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/world/chinese-city-of-30m-ordered-to-sing-red-songs-20110420-1dohw.html#ixzz1KgNl8kVq "Chinese city of 30m ordered to sing 'red songs'"].

Reactions to the red culture movement were divided. Bo<U+2019>s revival of Mao-era culture and accompanying social welfare programs were popular within much of the middle to lower income strata of Chongqing society, and made Bo a star with both conventional Marxists and neo-leftists. Bo won praise for returning the city to what some called China's 'true socialist heritage' by de-emphasizing material wealth, and evoked nostalgia to the social equality that existed during Mao's time.<ref name=Richburg>Keith B.

The campaign also had many detractors. Some intellectuals and reformers criticized the campaign for being regressive, akin to "being drowned in a red sea", and bringing back painful memories from the [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref name=Richburg/><ref name=redterror>Malcolm Moore, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9209177/Neil-Heywood-death-in-China-Bo-Xilai-drowned-Chongqing-in-a-sea-of-Red-terror.html Neil Heywood death in China: Bo Xilai <U+2018>drowned Chongqing in a sea of Red terror<U+2019>], Daily Telegraph, 17 April 2012.</ref> Several mid-level officials in the city committed suicide due to overwhelming pressure to organize events for the red songs campaign.<ref name=redterror/> Bo<U+2019>s critics derisively referred to him as "little Mao".<ref>Rosemary Righter, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/03/15/bo-xilai-s-sacking-signals-showdown-in-china-s-communist-party.html Bo Xilai<U+2019>s Sacking Signals Showdown In China<U+2019>s Communist Party], Newsweek, 15 March 2012.</ref>

====Social policies====
A cornerstone of Bo<U+2019>s Chongqing model involved a series of egalitarian social policies aimed to lessen the gap between rich and poor, and ease the rural-urban divide.  Bo promoted the notion of pursuing <U+201C>red GDP<U+201D><U+2014>an economic model embodying communist egalitarianism<U+2014>and suggested that, if [[Cake theory|economic development were analogous to 'baking a cake']], then the primary task should be to divide the cake fairly rather than building a larger cake.<ref name=reu>{{cite web|last=Buckley|first=Chris|title=In China's Chongqing, dismay over downfall of Bo Xilai|date=16 March 2012|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/16/us-china-chongqing-idUSBRE82F0H120120316|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=15 April 2012}}</ref> 

To that end, the city reportedly spent $15.8 billion on public apartment complexes for use by recent college graduates, migrant workers and low-income residents.<ref name=liu/> In 2007, the cities of Chongqing and Chengdu were selected to run pilot projects intended to mitigate the rural-urban divide and ease integration of rural residents into the cities. Under China<U+2019>s [[hukou]] registration system, citizens are classified as either rural or urban<U+2014>a distinction that determines nor only where they may live, but also affects educational opportunities, taxation, property rights, and so on.  Of Chongqing<U+2019>s 32 million residents, only 27% held urban hukous as of 2007.<ref name=EAI/> The 2007 project made it easier for rural residents to obtain urban status, a policy intended not only to help balance inequality, but also to enable the government to develop underused rural land. Under Bo<U+2019>s leadership, Chongqing established <U+201C>land exchanges<U+201D> where rural villages could earn credits for maximizing farmland.<ref>The Economist, [http://www.economist.com/node/16058750 Migration in China:Invisible and heavy shackles], 6 May 2010.</ref>  

Bo's approach to social policy was demonstrated during the November 2008 taxi strikes, which saw over 8,000 taxi drivers take to the streets for two days in protests over high fees, unregulated competition and rising fuel charges. Similar protests in China are frequently suppressed<U+2014>sometimes forcefully<U+2014>with official media sometimes blaming labor unrest on criminal instigation.<ref>Stephen Wong, [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/JL11Ad01.html Taxi protests test China's tolerance], Asia Times Online, 11 December 2008.</ref> Bo's government instead held a televised roundtable dialogues with the protesters and citizens, and agreed to allow the formation of a trade union. His handling of situation earned him praise as a comparatively restrained and progressive leader.<ref>Simon Elegant, [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1862718,00.html China's Taxi Strikes: A Test for the Government], Time, 28 November 2008.</ref><ref>Shai Oster, [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122990342979025141.html http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122990342979025141.html], Wall Street Journal, 22 December 2008.</ref>

====Economic policies====
Another major component of Bo<U+2019>s Chongqing model concerned the city<U+2019>s economic policies.  Just as he had done in Liaoning province, Bo ambitiously pursued foreign investment in the city, lowering corporate income tax rates (15% compared to the 25% national average), and sought to stimulate rapid urbanization and industrialization.<ref name=EAI/>  He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused on domestic consumption, rather than export-led growth.

During his tenure, Chongqing reported annual GDP growth far exceeding the national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade rose by 28%, and bank loans were up 29%.<ref name=EAI>Bo Zhiyue and Chen Gang, [http://www.eai.nus.edu.sg/BB465.pdf Bo Xilai and the Chongqing Model], East Asia Institute, Background Brief No. 465 (July 2009).</ref> 

Bo model of economic growth won national and international praise for seamlessly combining foreign investment and state-led growth. However, Bo's critics called the model of <U+201C>red GDP<U+201D> <U+2013> subsidized infrastructure, housing and public works projects <U+2013> unsustainable and a drain on the city's budget. Some civil servants complained that they were not getting salaries on time.<ref name=redterror/> Chongqing received a disproportionately high share (some $34 billion) of stimulus money from the Beijing in 2008. Political rivals such as Bo<U+2019>s predecessor Wang Yang also suggested that economic figures in Chongqing were <U+201C>rigged<U+201D><U+2014>artificially inflated through unnecessary construction and public works projects.<ref name=Newsweek2009>Melinda Liu, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/09/25/china-and-the-fights-within-its-single-party.html China and the Fights Within its Single Party], Newsweek, 25 September 2009.</ref>

===Leadership style===
Although many of Bo<U+2019>s campaigns earned popular support, especially from the city<U+2019>s poor, his leadership style has been described as <U+201C>propagandistic,<U+201D> <U+201C>ruthless,<U+201D> and <U+201C>arrogant<U+201D> by subordinates and city officials, academics, journalists, and other professionals.<ref name=wines/><ref name=redterror/>  Michael Wines of the New York Times wrote that although Bo was possessed of <U+201C>prodigious charisma and deep intelligence,<U+201D> these qualities were offset by a <U+201C>studied indifference to the wrecked lives that littered his path to power<U+2026>Mr. Bo<U+2019>s ruthlessness stood out, even in a system where the absence of formal rules ensures that only the strongest advance.<U+201D><ref name=wines/> Bo placed onerous demands on government officials in the city, requiring them to be available to work all day and all night, seven days a week.<ref name=redterror/> He reportedly called subordinates to late-night meetings, publicly criticized and humiliated those with whom he disagreed, and even hit underlings who failed to meet his demands.<ref name=wines/> According to a psychologist quoted in the Daily Telegraph, since Bo Xilai assumed power, "depression, burn out and suicides have all risen among officials<U+2026>Officials now make up the largest share of patients in counselling in the city.<U+201D><ref name=redterror/> 

In late 2009, a popular investigative television show on [[China Central Television]] aired a critical story on Bo<U+2019>s anti-crime drive, expressing concern over the apparent disregard for the legal process.  In response, Bo utilized his connections to have the show<U+2019>s host temporarily banned from the airwaves, and its producer moved to another program.<ref name=wines/> Others who opposed Bo<U+2019>s initiatives were also met with retribution. Li Zhuang, a defense lawyer from Beijing, was sentenced to two and a half years in prison (lated reduced to 18 months) in 2009 for attempting to defend one of the high-profile targets of Bo<U+2019>s crackdown.<ref name=wines/><ref>Ian Johnson, [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/20/world/asia/20china.html Trial in China Tests Limits of Legal System Reforms], New York Times, 19 April 2011.</ref> Cheng Li, a scholar at the [[Brookings Institution]], remarked that <U+201C>Nobody really trusts [Bo]: a lot of people are scared of him, including several princelings who are supposed to be his power base.<U+201D><ref name=wines/>

===Alleged eavesdropping operations===

===Death of Neil Heywood===
On 14 November 2011, British citizen [[Neil Heywood]] was found dead in his Chongqing hotel room.  At the time, local authorities declared he had died from alcohol over-consumption, though his family noted that he was not a heavy drinker. The official cause of death was not scrutinized until several months later, when revelations emerged that Heywood<U+2019>s death was a [[homicide]], and Bo Xilai was implicated.

===Wang Lijun incident===
{{main|Wang Lijun incident}}
In early 2012, the party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection bolstered its presence within Chongqing as the city's leaders came under investigation. Much of the attention focused on Bo's police chief, Wang Lijun, who may have been under investigation for his role in a corruption case in Liaoning province. Growing scrutiny over the city's wiretapping operation against senior leaders also likely fell mainly on Wang.<ref name=Eavesdrop/> Although details are scarce, several sources have suggested that Wang's resentment against Bo grew amidst the investigations<U+2014>resentment that was compounded when Wang realized that he and his wife had also been targets of wiretapping under Bo's orders.<ref name=Eavesdrop/>

Moreover, Wang was privy to details of Neil Heywood's death, and had reportedly attempted to voice his concerns to Bo about alleged poisoning. Around 16 January, Wang is believed to have confronted Bo over evidence that implicated Bo's wife in the murder. Although Bo initially agreed to allow an inquiry, he then changed course and sought to obstruct investigations.<ref name=inquiry>Reuters, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/17/neil-heywood-bo-xilai-wife Neil Heywood: Bo Xilai 'demoted police boss to block inquiry into wife's role'], 17 April 2012.</ref> Wang was abruptly demoted on 2 February to the far less prestigious position of Vice-mayor overseeing education, science, and environmental affairs.<ref>{{cite news|title=<U+8584><U+7199><U+6765><U+4ED5><U+9014><U+98CE><U+5411><U+6807><U+FF1F><U+91CD><U+5E86><U+6253><U+9ED1><U+5C40><U+957F><U+88AB><U+524A><U+6743>|url=http://www.voanews.com/chinese/news/20120202-Chongqing-Bo-xilai-138566054.html|accessdate=9 February 2012|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|date=2 February 2012}}</ref> Bo placed Wang under surveillance, and several of his close associates were reportedly taken into custody.
