'''Victoria''' {{IPAc-en|v|<U+026A>|k|<U+02C8>|t|<U+0254>r|i|<U+0259>}} is the capital city of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] and is located on the southern tip of [[Vancouver Island]] off Canada's [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast. The city has a population of about 80,017 within the [[metropolitan area]] of [[Greater Victoria, British Columbia|Greater Victoria]], which has a population of 344,615, making it the 15th most populous Canadian urban region.

Victoria is about {{convert|100|km|abbr=off}} from BC's largest city of [[Vancouver]] on the mainland. The city is about {{convert|100|km|abbr=off}} from [[Seattle]] by airplane, ferry, or the [[Clipper Navigation|Victoria Clipper]] passenger-only [[ferry]] which operates daily, year round between Seattle and Victoria and {{convert|40|km|abbr=off}} from [[Port Angeles, Washington|Port Angeles]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] by [[MV Coho|Coho]] ferry across the [[Juan de Fuca Strait|Strait of Juan de Fuca]].

Named after [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom]] and, at the time, [[British North America]], Victoria is one of the oldest cities in the [[Pacific Northwest]], with British settlement beginning in 1843. The city has retained a large number of its historic buildings, in particular its two most famous landmarks, the [[British Columbia Parliament Buildings]] (finished in 1897 and home of the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]]) and the [[The Empress (hotel)|Empress hotel]] (opened in 1908). The city's [[Chinatown, Victoria|Chinatown]] is the second oldest in North America after [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco's]]. The region's [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]] [[First Nations]] peoples established communities in the area long before non-native settlement, possibly several thousand years earlier, which had large populations at the time of European exploration. Victoria, like many Vancouver Island communities, continues to have a sizable First Nations presence, composed of peoples from all over Vancouver Island and beyond.

Known as the "City of Gardens", Victoria is an attractive city and a popular tourism destination with a thriving technology sector that has risen to be its largest revenue-generating private industry.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gemme|first=Brigitte|title=Economic Impact of the Greater Victoria Technology Sector|url=http://www.viatec.ca/sites/default/files/documents/VictoriaTechSector_EconImpact_Report_Final.pdf|work=This report was commissioned by the Victoria Advanced Technology Council (VIATeC) and prepared by Brigitte Gemme, Ph.D. candidate at the University of British Columbia. The study was supported by the ACCELERATE BC (MITACS) internship programme. The Centre for Sustainability and Social Innovation and its director, professor James Tansey, generously hosted the author of the report during the internship. The author and VIATeC would also like to thank the Victoria technology sector organizations who took the time to participate in this study.|publisher=University of British Columbia|accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref> The city has a large non-local student population, who come to attend the [[University of Victoria]], [[Camosun College]], [[Royal Roads University]], the Sooke Schools International Programme and the Canadian College of Performing Arts. Victoria is very popular with boaters with its beautiful and rugged shorelines and beaches. Victoria is also popular with [[Pensioner|retirees]], who come to enjoy the temperate and usually snow-free climate of the area as well as the usually relaxed pace of the city.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of European navigators in the late 1700s, the Victoria area was home to several communities of [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]] peoples, including the [[Songhees]]. The Spanish and British took up the exploration of the northwest Coast of North America beginning with the visits of [[Juan Jos<U+00E9> P<U+00E9>rez Hern<U+00E1>ndez|Juan Perez]] in 1774 and of Captain [[James Cook]] in 1778 although the Victoria area of the Strait of Juan de Fuca was not penetrated until 1790. Spanish sailors visited [[Esquimalt Harbour]] (just west of Victoria proper) in 1790, 1791, and 1792.

In 1841 [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] was charged with the duty of setting up a trading post on the southern tip of Vancouver Island, upon the recommendation by [[George Simpson (administrator)|Sir George Simpson]] that a new more northerly post be built in case [[Fort Vancouver]] fell into American hands (see [[Oregon boundary dispute]]). Douglas founded [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]], on the site of present-day Victoria, British Columbia in anticipation of the outcome of the [[Oregon Treaty]] in 1846, extending the [[British North America]]/United States border along the 49th parallel from the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] to the [[Georgia Strait|Strait of Georgia]].

Erected in 1843 as a [[Hudson's Bay Company]] trading post on a site originally called Camosun (the native word was "camosack", meaning "rush of water"){{citation needed|date=October 2010}} known briefly as "Fort Albert", the settlement was renamed [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]] in 1846, in honour of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].<ref>[http://www.city.victoria.bc.ca/visitors/about_hist.shtml City of Victoria - History]</ref> The Songhees established a village across the harbour from the fort. The Songhees' village was later moved north of [[Esquimalt]]. When the crown colony was established in 1849, a town was laid out on the site and made the capital of the colony. The Chief Factor of the fort, [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] was made the second governor of the Vancouver Island Colony ([[Richard Blanshard]] was first governor, [[Arthur Edward Kennedy]] was third and last governor), and would be the leading figure in the early development of the city until his retirement in 1864.

House built by Mungo Martin and David Martin with carpenter Robert J. Wallace. Based on Chief Nakap'ankam's house in Tsaxis (Fort Rupert). The house "bears on its house-posts the hereditary crests of Martin's family." It is still used for ceremonies with the permission of Chief Oast'akalagalis 'Walas 'Namugwis (Peter Knox, Martin's grandson) and Mable Knox. Pole carved by Mungo Martin, David Martin and Mildred Hunt. "Rather than display his own crests on the pole, which was customary, Martin chose to include crests representing the A'wa'etlala, Kwagu'l, 'Nak'waxda'xw and 'Namgis Nations. In this way, the pole represents and honours all the Kwakwaka'wakw people."</ref>]]

With the [[gold rush|discovery of gold]] on the British Columbia mainland in 1855, Victoria became the port, supply base, and outfitting centre for miners on their way to the [[Fraser Canyon]] gold fields, mushrooming from a population of 300 to over 5000 literally within a few days. Victoria was incorporated as a city in 1862.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bernard von Schulmann |url=http://victoriavision.blogspot.com/p/act-incorporating-city-of-victoria.html |title=A copy of the act incorporating the City |publisher=Victoriavision.blogspot.com |date=2013-09-30 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref> In 1865, Esquimalt was made the North Pacific home of the [[Royal Navy]], and remains Canada's west coast naval base. In 1866 when the island was politically united with the mainland, Victoria was designated the capital of the new [[United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia|united colony]] instead of [[New Westminster]] - an unpopular move on the Mainland - and became the provincial capital when British Columbia joined the [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1871. Memoirs still in print of those early days include those by painter [[Emily Carr]].

In the latter half of the 19th century, the Port of Victoria became one of North America's largest importers of opium, serving the opium trade from Hong Kong and distribution into North America. Opium trade was legal and unregulated until 1865, then the legislature issued licences and levied duties on its import and sale. The opium trade was banned in 1908.

In 1886, with the completion of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] terminus on [[Burrard Inlet]], Victoria's position as the commercial centre of British Columbia was irrevocably lost to the City of [[Vancouver]]. The city subsequently began cultivating an image of genteel civility within its natural setting, aided by the impressions of visitors such as [[Rudyard Kipling]], the opening of the popular [[Butchart Gardens]] in 1904 and the construction of the [[The Empress (Hotel)|Empress Hotel]] by the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1908. [[Robert Dunsmuir]], a leading industrialist whose interests included coal mines and a railway on Vancouver Island, constructed [[Craigdarroch Castle]] in the [[Rockland, Greater Victoria|Rockland]] area, near the [[Government House (British Columbia)|official residence]] of the province's lieutenant-governor. His son [[James Dunsmuir]] became premier and subsequently lieutenant-governor of the province and built his own grand residence at [[Hatley Park]] (used for several decades as [[Royal Roads Military College]], now civilian [[Royal Roads University]]) in the present City of [[Colwood, British Columbia|Colwood]].

A real estate and development boom ended just before World War I, leaving Victoria with a large stock of [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] public, commercial and residential buildings that have greatly contributed to the City's character. A number of municipalities surrounding Victoria were incorporated during this period, including the Township of Esquimalt, the District of Oak Bay, and several municipalities on the [[Saanich Peninsula]]. Since World War II the Victoria area has seen relatively steady growth, becoming home to two major universities. Since the 1980s the western suburbs have been incorporated as new municipalities, such as Colwood and [[Langford, British Columbia|Langford]], which are known collectively as the [[Western Communities]].

[[Greater Victoria]] periodically experiences calls for the [[amalgamation (politics)|amalgamation]] of the thirteen [[municipal government]]s within the [[Capital Regional District]].<ref name="Hansard">{{cite web

The proponents of amalgamation argue that it would reduce duplication of services, while allowing for more efficient use of resources and the ability to better handle broad, regional issues and long-term planning.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Geography==

===Geology===
The landscape of Victoria was formed by water in various forms. [[Pleistocene glaciation]] put the area under a thick ice cover, the weight of which depressed the land below present sea level. These glaciers also deposited stony sandy loam [[glacial till|till]]. As they retreated, their melt water left thick deposits of [[sand]] and [[gravel]]. Marine [[clay]] settled on what would later become dry land. Post-glacial rebound exposed the present-day terrain to air, raising beach and mud deposits well above sea level. The resulting soils are highly variable in texture, and abrupt textural changes are common. In general, clays are most likely to be encountered in the northern part of town and in depressions. The southern part has coarse-textured subsoils and loamy topsoils. Sandy loams and loamy sands are common in the eastern part adjoining Oak Bay. Victoria's soils are relatively unleached and less acidic than soils elsewhere on the [[British Columbia Coast]]. Their thick dark topsoils denoted a high level of fertility which made them valuable for farming until urbanization took over.

At the Victoria Gonzales weather station, daily temperatures rise above {{convert|30|<U+00B0>C}} on average less than one day per year and fall below {{convert|0|<U+00B0>C|1}} on average only ten nights per year. Victoria has recorded completely freeze-free winter seasons four times (in 1925/26, 1939/40, 1999/2000, and 2002/03).1999 is the only year on record without a single occurrence of frost. During this time the city went 718 days without freezing, starting on December 23, 1998 and ending December 10, 2000. The second longest frost-free period was a 686 day stretch covering 1925 and 1926, marking the first and last time the city has gone the entire season without dropping below 1<U+00B0>C (34<U+00B0>F).<ref name="Gonzales Heights Climate">{{cite web

Thanks to the [[rain shadow]] effect of the nearby Olympic Mountains, Victoria is the driest location on the British Columbia coast.  Total annual precipitation is just {{convert|608|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} at the Gonzales weather station in Victoria, compared with {{convert|3671|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} at Port Renfrew, just {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} away on the southwest coast of Vancouver Island.  Victoria also gets significantly less precipitation than nearby Vancouver, with {{convert|1589|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}, or Seattle, with {{convert|970|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.  Even the [[Victoria International Airport|Victoria Airport]], {{convert|25|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of the city, receives about 45 per cent more precipitation than the city proper.

One of the most striking features of Victoria's climate is that it has distinct dry and rainy seasons. Nearly two-thirds of the annual precipitation falls during the four wettest months, November to February. Precipitation in December, the wettest month ({{convert|109|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is nearly eight times as high as in July, the driest month ({{convert|14|mm|in|2|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Victoria experiences the driest summers in Canada (outside of the extreme northern reaches of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut).<ref>[http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/index_e.html Climate Normals & Averages | Canada's National Climate Archive]. Climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca (2013-02-04). Retrieved on 2013-07-12.</ref>

Victoria averages just {{convert|26|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} of snow annually, about half that of Vancouver. Every few decades Victoria receives very large snowfalls, including the record breaking {{convert|100|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} of snow that fell in December 1996. That amount places Victoria 3rd for biggest snowfall among major cities in Canada. On the other hand, roughly one-third of winters see virtually no snow, with less than {{convert|5|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} falling during the entire season. When snow does fall, it rarely lasts long on the ground. Victoria averages just two or three days per year with at least {{convert|5|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} of snow on the ground.

With 2,193 hours of bright sunshine annually, Victoria is the sunniest place in British Columbia with the exception of [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]].<ref name="climatenormals"/> On July, 1958, during the hottest summer in provincial history, Victoria received 424.6 hours of sunshine, which is the most sunshine ever recorded in any month in British Columbia history. This record has since been broken on July 2013, with 432.8 hours of sunshine.<ref>[http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/prods_servs/cdn_climate_summary_e.html Climate Summaries | Canada's National Climate Archive]. Climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca (2013-02-04). Retrieved on 2013-07-12.</ref> Often there is a break in the clouds over the Victoria area. Pilots use this "hole in the clouds" as a navigation aid, referring to it as the "blue hole".

Victoria's equable climate has also added to its reputation as the "City of Gardens". The city takes pride in the many flowers that bloom during the winter and early spring, including crocuses, daffodils, early-blooming rhododendrons, cherry and plum trees. Every February there is an annual "flower count" in what for the rest of the country and most of the province is still the dead of winter.

Due to its mild climate, Victoria and its surrounding area (southeastern Vancouver Island, [[Gulf Islands]], and parts of the [[Lower Mainland]] and [[Sunshine Coast, British Columbia|Sunshine Coast]]) are also home to many rare, native plants found nowhere else in Canada, including ''Quercus garryana'' ([[Garry oak]]), ''Arctostaphylos columbiana'' (Hairy [[manzanita]]), and Canada's only broad-leaf evergreen tree, ''Arbutus menziesii'' ([[Pacific madrone]]). Many of these species exist here, at the northern end of their range, and are found as far south as central and southern California and even parts of Mexico.

Non-native plants grown in Victoria include the cold-hardy palm [[Trachycarpus fortunei]],  which can be found in gardens and public areas of Victoria. One of these Trachycarpus palms stands in front of City Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/scazon/3616999233/?q=city |title=City hall Victoria palm |publisher=Flickr.com |date=2009-06-10 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref>

The population of the City of Victoria was 80,017 in 2011. The Victoria [[Census Metropolitan Area]], comprising thirteen municipalities informally referred to as [[Greater Victoria]], has a population of 344,615 and is the largest urban area on Vancouver Island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CMA&Code1=935&Geo2=PR&Code2=59&Data=Count&SearchText=victoria&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1 |title=Census Profile - Census Metropolitan Area/Census Agglomeration |publisher=2.statcan.ca |date=2012-02-01 |accessdate=2012-03-01}}</ref> By population, Greater Victoria is the 15th largest [[List of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in Canada|metropolitan area]] in Canada.

===Age distribution===
Victoria is known for its disproportionately large [[retiree]] population. Some 6.4 percent of the population of Victoria and its surrounding area are more than 80 years of age<U+2014>the highest proportion for any of Canada's metropolitan areas. The city also boasts the country's third-highest concentration of people 65 and older (17.8 per cent), behind only [[Peterborough, Ontario]], and [[Kelowna]], British Columbia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070717/census_victoria_070717/20070717?hub=Canada|title=Victoria, B.C. a Mecca for elderly: census |publisher=[[CTV.ca]]|accessdate=2007-07-17}}</ref> Retirees throughout Canada are drawn to Victoria's mild climate, beautiful scenery, year-round golf season, and generally easy-going pace of life. A historically popular clich<U+00E9> referring to the city was that it is for "the newly wed and nearly dead".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victoria.ca/common/pdfs/profiles_neigh_qa.pdf|title=City of Victoria Profile|accessdate=2011-11-22}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref>

===Social conditions===

In January 2005, a volunteer study by the [[Victoria Cool Aid Society]] found the homeless population to be approximately 700 individuals.<ref name="Homeless Count <U+2013> 2005 Victoria, BC">[http://intraspec.ca/Homeless_Survey.pdf Homeless Count <U+2013> 2005 Victoria, BC] Cool Aid Society.

The [[Victoria Symphony]], led by Tania Miller, performs at the [[Royal Theatre (Victoria, British Columbia)|Royal Theatre]] and the Farquhar Auditorium of the [[University of Victoria]] from September to May. Every [[BC Day]] weekend, the Symphony mounts Symphony Splash, an outdoor event that includes a performance by the orchestra sitting on a barge in Victoria's Inner Harbour. Streets in the local area are closed, as each year approximately 40,000 people attend a variety of concerts and events throughout the day. The event culminates with the Symphony's evening concert, with Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture as the grand finale, complete with cannon fire from Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Gunners from HMCS QUADRA, a pealing carillon and a fireworks display to honour BC Day.

A source of Victoria's power, 18 March 2001 (pdf 140K). geog.Uvic.ca [http://www.geog.uvic.ca/dept2/faculty/newcomb/JordanRiverPower.PDF]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref>

The city's water is supplied by the Capital Regional District's Water Services Department from its Sooke Lake Reservoir. The lake water is very soft and requires no filtering. It is treated with chlorine, ammonia and ultraviolet light to control micro-organisms.<ref>{{cite web

The water used to flow through the {{convert|44|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Sooke Flowline]] which has now been retired but can still be visited today.

The [[Hartland landfill]] is the waste disposal site for Greater Victoria area. Since 1985, it has been run by the [[Capital Regional District]] environmental services. It is located on top of a hill, between Victoria and [[Sidney, British Columbia|Sidney]], at the end of Hartland Avenue.{{Coord|48.538148|N|123.463368|W |region:CA_}} There is a recycling centre, a sewer solid waste collection, hazardous waste collection, and an electricity generating station. This generating station now creates 1.6 megawatts of electricity, enough for 1,600 homes.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.crd.bc.ca/waste/hartland/index.htm |title=Hartland Overview |publisher=Crd.bc.ca |date=2009-03-23 |accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref> The site has won international environmental awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civicinfo.bc.ca/practices_innovations/capital_hartland_forest.pdf |title=Hartland Landfill Site Rehabilitation |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref> The [[Capital Regional District|CRD]] conducts public tours of the facility. It is predicted to be full by 2045.

The wastewater treatment facilities at Clover Pt. and Macaulay Pt. serve seven municipalities comprising the core area of the CRD. At these two facilities, wastewater is screened to exclude objects larger than {{convert|6|mm|in|2|abbr=off}} then pumped through diffusers at the end of deep marine outfalls.<ref name="water">{{cite web|url=http://www.crd.bc.ca/wastewater/facilities.htm |title=Wastewater Treatment Facilities |publisher=Crd.bc.ca |date=2006-05-02 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref> The CRD is currently planning an upgrade of its wastewater treatment infrastructure.

The Saanich Peninsula wastewater treatment plant serves North Saanich, Central Saanich and the Town of Sidney as well as the Victoria International Airport, the Institute of Ocean Sciences and the Tseycum and Pauquachin First Nations communities. This is a secondary level treatment plant which produces Class A [[biosolids]].<ref name="water"/>

===Transportation===
Local public transportation is run by the [[Victoria Regional Transit System]], which is part of [[BC Transit]]. Since 2000, [[double decker bus]]es have been introduced to the fleet and have become an icon for the city. Rider fare payments can be made in cash, monthly bus passes, disability yearly passes, or tickets.

Passenger rail service to Victoria was provided by [[Via Rail]], which operated the [[Victoria <U+2013> Courtenay train]] north, along the eastern coast of Vancouver Island, to the cities of [[Nanaimo]], [[Courtenay, British Columbia|Courtenay]], and points between. There was one daily return trip, departing Victoria in the morning, and returning from Courtenay in the evening. Services along this line were suspended indefinitely on March 19, 2011, due to track replacement work.<ref name="timescolonist">{{cite news|url=http://www.timescolonist.com/news/todays-paper/Island+Dayliner+train+parked+indefinitely+track+problems/4573834/story.html|title=Island's Dayliner train parked indefinitely due to track problems|work=Times Colonist|date=April 7, 2011|accessdate=April 7, 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref><ref name="Viccity">{{cite news|url=http://www.viccity.ca/v2/news/7231/E&N+rail+service+doomed+without+huge+injection+of+government+cash+says+operators/|title=E&N rail service doomed without huge injection of government cash says operators|work=Viccity.ca|date=April 26, 2011|accessdate=October 4, 2011}}</ref> Prior to further inspection of the track, service along the segment between Nanaimo and Victoria was originally planned to resume on April 8, but lack of funding has prevented any of the work from taking place and it is unclear when or if the service will resume.

The [[Victoria International Airport]] has non-stop flights to and from [[Toronto]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]] and many cities throughout [[Western Canada]]. Multiple scheduled helicopter and seaplane flights are available daily from Victoria's [[Victoria Inner Harbour Airport|Inner Harbour]] to [[Vancouver International Airport]], Vancouver Harbour, and Seattle. The [[BC Ferries]] [[Swartz Bay Ferry Terminal]], located {{convert|29|km|mi}} north of Victoria, has hourly sailings to [[Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal|Tsawwassen]] (a ferry terminal south of Vancouver) and to many of the [[Gulf Islands]]. The [[Washington State Ferry]] terminal in [[Sidney, British Columbia|Sidney]] provides ferry service to [[Friday Harbor]], [[Orcas Island]], and ultimately [[Anacortes]], Washington. In Victoria's Inner Harbour, an international [[ferry terminal]] provides [[Roll-on/roll-off|car ferry]] service ([[M/V Coho]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cohoferry.com/main/ |title=Coho ferry |publisher=Coho ferry |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref> to [[Port Angeles, Washington|Port Angeles]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], high-speed [[catamaran]] service ([[Victoria Clipper]]) to [[Downtown Seattle]], and seasonal passenger ferries to destinations in Washington including Friday Harbor, Port Angeles, and [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]]. Victoria also serves as the western terminus (Mile Zero) for Canada's [[Trans-Canada Highway]], the longest national highway in the world. The Mile Zero is located in the southern part of the city at the corner of [[Douglas Street]] and Dallas Road, where there is a small monument.

Direct flights between Victoria and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] ([[San Francisco]], [[Oakland]], [[Silicon Valley]]) began service on June 5, 2008 ([[Victoria Times Colonist]], February 6, 2008). Trips will be 2 hours instead of the usual 6 hours because there will be no stop overs in Seattle, as with other flights. The service will be operated by [[United Airlines]], using 66 seat [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] [[CRJ700]] aircraft. The same newspaper article also mentions the [[Victoria Airport Authority]]'s plans for further capacity expansions at the [[Victoria International Airport]]. These are expected to offer extended economic benefits to the region, especially the Tourism and High Tech industries. [[West Jet]] started a direct flight service to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], three times per week, on September 9, 2008 (Victoria Times Colonist, May 29, 2008).

Bus service between Victoria and Vancouver is run by [[Pacific Coach Lines]]. The bus travels on the ferry. Average travel time between the two cities is 4 hours. Bus service from Victoria to points up island is run by [[Vancouver Island Coach Lines]]. Both bus services depart from the Victoria bus terminal located at 900 Douglas Street, behind the [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts|Fairmont]] [[The Empress (hotel)|Empress Hotel]].

Local roadways, although showing signs of increasing congestion due to increasing population, are relatively easy to travel via a variety of means. However, roads in Victoria are not based on a grid system as in Vancouver or [[Edmonton]], and even most major streets do not follow a straight line from beginning to end as they wind around hills, parks, coastlines, and historic neighbourhoods, often changing names two or three times. There is little distinction between "streets" and "avenues" in Victoria as there is in other cities such as Vancouver or Edmonton where "streets" run north-south and "avenues" run east-west, and Victorians are unlikely to use the terms "north", "south", "east", or "west" when giving directions.

The compact size of the city lends itself readily to smaller, fuel efficient alternatives to full size passenger cars, such as [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]], as areas with signicantly steep hills, such as one would find in San Francisco, are very few. Victoria is also in the process of making the use of such methods of transportation more desirable (in a push towards a more "green", eco-friendly environment), by offering incentives to use such modes of transport, such as parking spaces in the downtown core specifically designed for vehicles "{{convert|3|m|ft|1}} or less" in wheelbase size, thus fostering the desirability for ownership of vehicles such as [[Smart Car]]s, [[motorcycle]]s and small displacement scooters. Generally speaking, one can expect to reach almost most destinations within Greater Victoria within a time span of 20 <U+2013> 30 minutes, perhaps approximately 60 minutes, dependent on traffic conditions, road construction or other reasons for blockage, where you are coming from, going to, and mode of transport. Travel time is longer during [[rush hour]] times due to large volume of traffic.

Within the Greater Victoria area, private cars, SUVs, and light trucks together make up the majority of trips. However, the city boasts an excellent public transit system using a fleet of modern buses, and is beginning to plan for a rapid transit link to the western communities. Greater Victoria also has an expanding system designed to facilitate bicycles and [[electric bicycle|electrically assisted bicycles]] via bike lanes on many main roads as well as the [[Galloping Goose Regional Trail]] and [[Lochside Regional Trail]]. These trails are designed exclusively for foot traffic and cyclists, and now pass through many communities, beginning at the downtown core and extending into areas such as Langford and Central and North Saanich.

==Education==
[[Image:Hatley Castle front entrance Aug 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Roads University]] ([[Hatley Park National Historic Site]])]]
The city of Victoria lies entirely within the [[Greater Victoria School District]]. There is one high school located within the city boundaries, [[Victoria High School (British Columbia)|Victoria High School]], founded in 1876, making it the oldest High School in North America north of Portland, Oregon and west of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Most of the elementary schools in Victoria now offer the popular [[French immersion]] programmes in addition to programmes in English. The educational needs of the Francophone community in Victoria are served by [[<U+00C9>cole Victor-Brodeur]] in the adjacent municipality of [[Esquimalt, British Columbia|Esquimalt]]. In addition, within the city proper there are several smaller schools serving segments of the community such as the Chinese School in Chinatown, St. Andrew's Elementary School and Christ Church Cathedral School. The senior campus of Glenlyon-Norfolk House School is located in the [[Fairfield, Greater Victoria|Fairfield]] neighbourhood.

The City of Victoria is served by three public post secondary educational institutions actually located outside the city in the [[Greater Victoria]] area: [[University of Victoria]] (UVic), [[Camosun College]], and [[Royal Roads University]] (RRU). Camosun College has two campuses, one in Royal Oak, a municipality north of Victoria, and one that is located in the heart of Victoria close to University of Victoria.

[[Lester B. Pearson College of the Pacific]] is an international school, in [[Metchosin, British Columbia|Metchosin]], a municipality to the west of Victoria. There are also several private vocational and English ([[ESL]]) training schools available for people who want to learn the English language or upgrade new job market skills. [[Sprott Shaw College]] is a private career training institution that has had a campus in Victoria since 1913.

==Media==
{{Main|Media in Victoria, British Columbia}}

Victoria is the only Canadian provincial capital without a local [[CBC Television]] station, owned-and-operated or affiliate, although it does host a small [[CBC Radio]] station in the 700 block of Kings Road. The region is considered to be a part of the [[Media in Vancouver#Television|Vancouver television market]], receiving most stations that broadcast from across the [[Strait of Georgia]], including the [[CBUT-DT|CBC]], [[CIVT-DT|CTV]], [[CKVU-DT|City]] and [[CHAN-DT|Global]] networks. Television stations based in Victoria include [[CHEK-DT|CHEK]] and [[CIVI-DT|CTV Two]] (formerly The New VI and A-Channel).
