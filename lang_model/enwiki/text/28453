O'Brien claimed he was responsible for Colbert's success because he mentioned him on his show. In response, Stewart claimed he was responsible for ''O'Brien'''s success, since Stewart featured him on ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'', and in turn the success of Huckabee.

As the feud escalated, O'Brien, Colbert and Stewart each put forward increasingly [[farce|farcical]] reasons why he was responsible for Huckabee's success, insulting their rivals in the process. This resulted in a three-part comedic battle between the three faux-pundits, with all three appearing on each other's shows. The feud ended on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' with a tongue-in-cheek "all-out brawl" between the three talk-show hosts.<ref name="msnbc">[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23017599/  Conan, Stewart, Colbert unite in TV feud].

Reaction to the "feud" by both the public and the media was mostly positive. [[TV Squad]]'s Annie Wu beamed: "With the three hosts appearing on each others' shows all on one night, it was special appearances galore. It became a clash of the Titans, a battle of epic proportions, a heaping helping of Monday fanservice."<ref name="tv squad"/>  Even so, the three comedians "shared a certain comedic sensibility",<ref name="msnbc"/> and admitted that they had a good time while helping each other out. "It certainly helped," said O'Brien, "that all three of us [were] in a period of our careers where we<U+2019>re looking for content."<ref name="nyt"/>

=== Beginning ===

The [[2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike|2007-2008 Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike]], which began in November 2007, all but crippled the United States' entertainment industry.

Much of the blame for what started the "feud" lies with [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert's fictional persona]]. Described as a "well-intentioned, poorly informed high-status idiot",<ref>Solomon, Deborah (September 25, 2005). [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/magazine/25questions.html?_r=1&oref=slogin Funny About the News]. ''New York Times Magazine.'' Retrieved on 2007-[[November 13|11-13]].</ref> the character is a blustery, self-obsessed [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] pundit with a strong distaste for facts. Colbert is deeply self-centered and takes everything personally, a trait which is reflected in his discussion of the news and current events.  According to the comedian, "There's nothing too large that doesn't involve him. Every news story is really about him ... Everything he cares about is a news story because he cares about it." This is expressed in his frequent attacks on and feuds (known as <U+201C>[[culture war]]s<U+201D>) with other well-known figures such as the [[Decemberists]], [[Barry Manilow]], [[Sean Penn]], and O<U+2019>Brien.

Huckabee generated a considerable following of young voters during his campaign, primarily because of his support of the [[Fair Tax]] as well as his concerns about [[global warming]], education, and several other issues typically not referred to by Republicans.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1580804/20080201/index.jhtml Mike Huckabee Weighs In on Gay Rights...

[http://www.hucksarmy.com/ Huck's Army], an online grassroots coalition and volunteer [[think tank]], is largely composed of younger, more technologically savvy adherents. So productive was this group that it received national media attention and was credited by Huckabee as "the secret weapon of our campaign".

On January 4, 2008, O'Brien attempted to take responsibility for Huckabee's popularity among young voters by claiming that his show was the sole cause of Huckabee's status in the votes, due to his use of "The ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' [[Sketches from Late Night with Conan O'Brien#The Walker Texas Ranger Lever|Lever]]"<ref>A recurring gag on the show is O'Brien's use of a lever called ''"[[Sketches from Late Night with Conan O'Brien#The Walker Texas Ranger Lever|The Walker, Texas Ranger Lever]]"'' to show clips from the series (most of the clips are usually fight scenes).

Colbert later lashed out at O'Brien on his own show on January 16, 2008, claiming that ''he'' himself was responsible for Huckabee's success in [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2008|the Iowa caucus]] thanks to his giving Huckabee "the Colbert bump."  The exasperated Colbert ended his rant with this "threat" against O'Brien:
<blockquote>
"So back off of Mike Huckabee, or I will kick your translucent white ass!

Colbert, of course, ignored the Chuck Norris factor.<ref name="Violent">[http://defamer.com/352822/vicious-cross+network-melee-leaves-stewart-obrien-and-colbert-in-critical-condition Vicious Cross-Network Melee Leaves Stewart, O'Brien and Colbert In Critical Condition]</ref>

During the January 17, 2008 episode of ''Late Night'', O'Brien, in what he later described as "a heated moment", called Colbert the "temporary host of ''The Colbert Report''."<ref name="Conan vs. Colbert"/>  O'Brien also refused to recant his statement concerning Huckabee, claiming that, just by mentioning Colbert on his network show, he was, in turn, "breathing life" into ''Colbert'''s "[[basic cable]]" career.<ref name="Conan vs. Colbert"/> Therefore, according to his logic, " if Colbert made Huckabee, and Conan made Colbert, then '''Conan made Huckabee'''!"<ref name="Conan vs. Colbert">[http://www.nbc.com/Late_Night_with_Conan_O'Brien/video/index.shtml#mea=206915 ''"Conan vs. Colbert: Who Made Huckabee?

In response, during the January 29, 2008 episode of ''The Colbert Report'', Colbert, persuaded by "the soundness of [O'Brien's] logic", was prepared to concede. Before he could, however, Jon Stewart, Colbert's former ''Daily Show'' colleague, appeared on the set and cautioned Colbert against doing so. Stewart exhibited a vintage [[VHS]] tape, which contained footage of him introducing O'Brien on Stewart's earlier [[MTV]] program, ''The Jon Stewart Show'', in 1994.<ref name="msnbc"/>  Therefore, by ''his'' own logic:
<blockquote>
"Colbert made Huckabee... Conan made Colbert... '''Jon Stewart''' made Conan...

</blockquote>
Colbert accepted this, as it kept Huckabee's 'creation' "in the family."<ref name="stewart"/> Stewart then jokingly said it was up to O'Brien to respond, so that the three of them could "figure out a way to settle the matter that wastes time on all three of [their] shows"<ref name="stewart"/><U+2014>an obvious allusion to the writers' strike and the need to generate new material without said writers.  Colbert ended the segment with the crack, "Ball's in ''your'' court, Conan!"

<blockquote>

This resulted in a three-part comedic battle between the three faux-pundits, with all three [[crossover (fiction)|appearing on each other's shows]] on February 4, 2008. It all began on the set of ''The Daily Show'', when Colbert, to thunderous applause, interrupted the middle of a seemingly normal show to thank Stewart for settling the feud.<ref name="LNT"/>  Stewart at first responded happily to this, but then grew visibly frightened once Colbert informed him of O'Brien's response from a few days before.<ref name="LNT">[http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=155946 ''"Late Night Tangle"''].

[http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=56052 Did Conan, Colbert or Stewart create Huckabee?] WorldNetDaily. Published [[2008]]-[[02-11]]. Retrieved [[2008]]-[[07-22]].</ref> TV Squad's Annie Wu beamed: "With the three hosts appearing on each others' shows all on one night, it was special appearances galore. It became a clash of the Titans, a battle of epic proportions, a heaping helping of Monday fanservice."<ref name="tv squad"/>  

Interestingly, upon returning to air on January 7, 2008, ''The Daily Show'' and ''The Colbert Report'' had increased ratings. As of the end of January 2008, ''The Daily Show'' was up 17 percent for viewers between 18-34 from January 2007 and up nine percent for 18-49 year olds in the same period. ''The Colbert Report'' was up 21 percent for 18-34 year olds and 15 percent for 18-49 year olds over the same time period. ''Late Night with Conan O<U+2019>Brien'', however, remained at a normal level, with 2.5 million viewers.<ref name="nymag">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-11|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/features/14575/index.html|title=Conan on the Couch|publisher=[[New York magazine]]|date=2005-09-26|author=Grigoriadis, Vanessa}}</ref>
One reason given for the increase in ''Daily Show'' and ''Colbert Report'' ratings was the [[United States presidential election, 2008|current presidential election]], allowing them a large amount of political humor to use. However, one journalist commented that the raise of ratings in these two shows without the writers "has to be a big [[PR]] setback for the WGA."<ref>{{cite news|last=Downey|first=Kevin|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman2/publish/Cable_20/Hefty_bounces_for_Stewart_and_Colbert.asp|title=Hefty bounces for Stewart and Colbert|publisher=Media Life Magazine|date=2008-01-29|accessdate=2008-01-31}}</ref>

In fact, not long after the "Who Made Huckabee?" feud culminated, the writers' strike officially ended on February 13, 2008,<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://weblogs.variety.com/wga_strike_blog/2008/02/wgas-press-rele.html|title=WGA's Press Release|publisher=[[Variety magazine]]}}</ref> with the writers returning to work the following day, at which point the titles of ''The Daily Show'' and ''The Colbert Report'' were restored.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stelter |first=Brian |title=Scripts Reappear on 'Daily Show' |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/18/business/media/18teleprompTer.html?ref=to&pagewanted=all |publisher=''New York Times'' |date=2008-02-18 |accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref>

In contrast to the strained relationship depicted on-camera among Colbert, O'Brien, and Stewart,<ref>Franklin, Nancy (November 28, 2005).

<blockquote>
"For anyone watching, it was clear the three hosts share a certain comedic sensibility. Such playfulness would seem impossible with other late-night talk-show hosts; [[CBS]]' [[David Letterman]] and NBC's [[Jay Leno]], for instance, have long had icy relations."<ref name="msnbc"/>

This from TV Squad's Annie Wu:
<blockquote>
"I would also like to note that even those that haven't found this fake feud particularly amusing must find a bit of sweetness in it. After all, these are hosts that have constantly expressed how lost they feel without their writers. There's something wonderful in seeing three comedians doing each other a favor by creating some silly material and taking it this far, just to help fill time. This one dumb fight alone has taken up so many episodes. Bless their little late night hearts for helping each other out."<ref name="tv squad">[http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/02/05/the-obrien-vs-stewart-vs-colbert-three-show-throwdown-video/ The O'Brien vs. Stewart vs. Colbert three-show throwdown - VIDEOS].

In a similar fashion John Gillespie, of ''A Sensitivity to Things'', found the brawl "inspiring",<ref name="sensitivity"/> and stated:
<blockquote>
"What is really great about this clip, the in-joke that informs, underlines everything you see, is that these are three very famous people, working in exactly the same field, competing directly for television ratings and advertising dollars, who should supposedly have very large egos, making fun of all of that, and revealing&nbsp;<U+2014> wait... is that irony, on American TV?&nbsp;<U+2014> that they are probably very good friends, having a very good time."<ref name="sensitivity">Gillespie, John.

Retrieved on [[2008]]-[[06-11]].</ref>
</blockquote>

"My favorite comedy is comedy where nothing is achieved and there is no point," O'Brien said. "That this whole Huckabee fight turned into an insane [[Marx Brothers]] dance was fitting somehow [...] The fight itself is three people with a box full of props playing for about an hour."<ref name="msnbc"/>
