'''Cape Cod Expressway''' is the name given to a highway that was proposed to have gone from [[New York City]] to [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]]. The road later became part of many highways and expressways, although it was never built.

==History==
During the early half of the 20th Century, states began having congestion impact local roads. In response, many states began building expressways in order to alleviate this congestion. In 1953, the governors of [[New York]], [[Connecticut]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Massachusetts]] began to plan a 260-mile long expressway that would link [[New York City]] to [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]]. The highway was projected to cost around $75 million, and would be between four and six lanes wide. Furthermore, parts of the highway would act as a toll road, although the entire road would not be tolled. Finally, the route was billed as, "the most direct and shortest highway route between the present and potentially major urban-industrial and recreational concentrations, and between significant military installations of the shore route area."<ref name=EasternRoads>{{cite web|title=Connecticut Turnpike: Historic Overview|url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/ct-turnpike/|publisher=Eastern Roads|accessdate=25 February 2013|year=2013}}</ref> 

==Route==
Coming out of [[New York City]], the route would have followed [[Interstate 95]] along the [[New England Thruway]] until the [[Connecticut]] border, where it would meet up with what later became the [[Connecticut Turnpike]]. Once it reached [[Rhode Island]], the expressway would follow [[Rhode Island Route 138|Route 138]] to [[Rhode Island Route 24|Route 24]], [[Interstate 195 (Rhode Island<U+2013>Massachusetts)|Interstate 195]] (where it would cross into [[Massachusetts]]), [[Massachusetts Route 25|Route 25]], and [[U.S. Route 6 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 6]] all the way to [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]].<ref name=EasternRoads /><ref name="Bostonroads1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/MA-25/|title=MA 25 Expressway-Historic Overview|year=2009|publisher=Eastern Roads|accessdate=24 February 2013}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The route was built as planned from [[New York City]] until [[Interstate 95 in Rhode Island]]. Due to [[Highway revolts]], the route along [[Rhode Island Route 138|Route 138]] to [[Rhode Island Route 24|Route 24]] ended up not being completed (both roads were also concurrently signed with [[Interstate 895 (Rhode Island<U+2013>Massachusetts)|Interstate 895]] at one point, as well).<ref name=EasternRoads /> In Massachusetts, [[Charles M. Braga Jr. Memorial Bridge]], which carries [[Interstate 195 (Rhode Island<U+2013>Massachusetts)|Interstate 195]] was built with the eventual aim of carrying the expressway.<ref name=Bostonroads2>{{cite web|title=Charles Braga Bridge (I-195)|url=http://www.bostonroads.com/crossings/braga/|publisher=Boston Roads|accessdate=25 February 2013|year=2013}}</ref> [[Massachusetts Route 25|Route 25]] in Massachusetts would eventually be constructed along the proposed route of the expressway. In [[Bourne, Massachusetts|Bourne]], plans for the expressway turned into the [[Southside Connector]] was planned around the same time as the expressway, but also never built.<ref name=Bostonroads1 /> On [[Cape Cod]], the road turned into the [[Mid-Cape Highway]] and was constructed as an expressway until the Orleans Rotary. Because the road served as a main thoroughfare for towns north of Orleans, the expressway idea likely was abandoned, although between [[North Truro, Massachusetts|North Truro]] and [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]], grade-separated interchanges were constructed in remote sections.<ref name=Bostonroads3>{{cite web|title=Mid-Cape Highway (US 6)|url=http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/mid-cape/|publisher=Boston Roads|accessdate=25 February 2013|year=2013}}</ref>
