{{Falklands War}}

The '''loss of Gazelle XX377''', was a "[[friendly fire]]" incident over the [[Falkland Islands]] that occurred on 6 June 1982 during the [[Falklands War]]. A British Royal Navy [[Type 42]] destroyer misidentified a friendly Army Air Corps [[A<U+00E9>rospatiale Gazelle|Gazelle]] helicopter as an enemy Argentine [[C-130 Hercules]] resupply plane. The destroyer, {{HMS|Cardiff|D108|6}}, shot down the helicopter, killing all on-board.<ref name="MOD board of inquiry">{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/EF248AAE-5B25-4CB4-BE90-EE096980354B/0/boi_loss_gazellexx377.pdf |format=PDF|title=board of inquiry into the Loss of AAC Gazelle XX37 |author=Navy Command HQ |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]|accessdate=2008-11-19}}</ref><ref name="L/Cpl.

A subsequent investigation blamed the accident on several factors. A lack of communication between both the army and navy, [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Infantry Brigade]] had not notified any other authority, most significantly the Royal Navy, of the helicopter's flight. Conversely the navy had not informed the land forces that ''Cardiff'' had changed position and set up an ambush for Argentine aircraft travelling over the area. Also, the helicopter's "[[Identification Friend or Foe]]" (IFF) transmitter was turned off due to it causing interference with their land based anti-aircraft missile system, [[Rapier missile|Rapier]].

However no formal inquiry was held until fours years after the incident, nor were the relatives of the deceased told about the true nature of helicopter's demise until this time.<ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)">{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1986/jun/25/falkland-islands-gazelle-helicopter|title=Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter) (Hansard, 25 June 1986)|publisher=hansard.millbanksystems.com|accessdate=2008-11-19}}</ref> The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] stated that they had not wanted to "cause further anguish to relatives" while they were still trying to ascertain whether or not the aircraft had actually been shot down by friendly fire.<ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)"/> The board of inquiry recommended that "neither negligence nor blame should be attributed to any individual".<ref name="MOD board of inquiry"/>

== Background ==
[[Image:Argentine Hercules.jpg|thumb|174px|An Argentine [[C-130 Hercules]]]]

On 2 April 1982, the disputed [[British overseas territory]] of the [[Falkland Islands]] was invaded by neighbouring Argentina. The United Kingdom, nearly {{convert|8000|mi|km|lk=on}} away, assembled and dispatched a naval [[Events leading to the Falklands War#Task force|task force]], comprising of approximately 5,000&nbsp;troops, to recapture the islands. The conflict ended in June with the [[Falklands War Argentine surrender|surrender of the Argentine forces]], with battles being fought on land, sea and in the air, costing the lives of approximately 900 servicemen (both sides).

In early May, British troops had landed on the western side of [[East Falkland]] at [[San Carlos, Falkland Islands|San Carlos]], from there they advanced east towards the occupied [[capital]] of [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]]. They therefore needed logistical supplies, or communication equipment in this case, to be brought up to them from San Carlos, as they continued to advance. At the capital, Argentina resupplied it's garrison using their [[C-130 Hercules]] aircraft right up until the end of the war. These Argentine "milk-runs"<ref>{{cite book |author=Ward, Nigel "Sharkey" |authorlink=Sharkey Ward |title=Sea Harrier Over the Falklands |publisher=[[Cassell Military Paperbacks]] |year=2006 |pages=p. 323|chapter=Chapter 29 |isbn=0-304-35542-9}}</ref> were much to the "dismay"<ref>{{cite book |last=Hastings |first=Max |authorlink=Max Hastings |coauthors=[[Simon Jenkins]] |title=The Battle for the Falklands |year=1983 |publisher=[[Book Club Associates]] |location=[[Bungay]], [[Suffolk]] |pages=p. 158|chapter=Chapter 9 }}</ref> of the Royal Navy, who therefore made various attempts to intercept them.

On the night of 5 June 1982 the British [[Type 42]] destroyer, {{HMS|Cardiff|D108|6}}, had moved east of the islands, to the "Bluff Cove Gunline" to aid the advancing marines of [[3 Commando Brigade]] with [[naval gunfire support]]. Simultaneously she had been tasked with intercepting any Argentine aircraft attempting to resupply [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]]. She had carried out a mission very similar to this just four nights previous, where she unsuccessfully attempted to shoot down a resupply craft upon landing and takeoff.<ref name="L/Cpl. S. J.

Pilots [[Staff Sergeant#United Kingdom|SSgt]] Christopher Griffin and [[Lance Corporal#United Kingdom|LCpl]] Simon Cockton of [[No. 656 Squadron AAC|656 Squadron]], [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]], had been tasked with taking equipment and personnel to a malfunctioning "radio rebroadcast station" on top of [[Pleasant Peak]]. The station had been established there the previous day in order to provide a communications link between the [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Infantry Brigade]] headquarters at [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Darwin]] and the [[2nd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment|2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment]] at [[Fitzroy, Falkland Islands|Fitzroy]].<ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)"/> Night flying conditions were excellent with a clear sky, a prominent moon and a wind speed of {{convert|20|kn|km/h|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)"/> They departed from [[Goose Green]] in Gazelle&nbsp;no.&nbsp;XX377 and picked up the replacement equipment from the Darwin HQ.

''Cardiff's'' crew could even saw the fireball, although with the aid of [[night vision goggles]]. 

The loss of the helicopter caused the British to think that Argentine forces were still operating in the area,<ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)"/> so they sent out a number of [[Brigade of Gurkhas|Gurkha]]s to find these non-existent enemies. When the Gurkhas came across the personnel manning the Pleasant Peak station there was potential for another friendly fire incident to occur, however no such thing happened.<ref name="Freedman"/> At first light a search was mounted and the wreckage was found along with the deceased aircrew and passengers.<ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)"/> Immediately there were suspicions that ''Cardiff'' had been responsible for the shootdown<ref name="L/Cpl.

Cockton"/> and later that evening Rear Admiral [[Sandy Woodward|"Sandy" Woodward]] declared a "[[Weapons Tight]]" order for any aircraft flying over [[East Falkland]] at less than {{convert|200|kn|km/h|abbr=on|lk=on}} and under {{convert|610|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref name="MOD board of inquiry"/>

== Investigations ==
[[Image:Sea Dart missile HMS Cardiff 1982.JPG|thumb|upright|A live [[Sea Dart missile|Sea Dart]] missile on HMS Cardiff in 1982]]

The wreckage was inspected on-site but the British were unable to confirm whether the helicopter had been destroyed by ''Cardiff'''s missile or by Argentine forces. These doubts caused the commanders to decide that a board of inquiry was not required and declared no.&nbsp;XX377 as "lost in action". They surmised that if they told the deceased's relatives that the Gazelle may have been shot down due to a friendly fire incident, it would add to their grief.<ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)"/> After the war, missile fragments that had been found in the wreckage were taken to [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]] [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]] for analysis. These scientific tests concluded that the fragments were not from a British [[Sea Dart missile|Sea Dart]] missile,<ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)"/> despite a Sea Dart missile casing later being found "several hundred [[yard]]s" away from the wreckage.<ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)"/>

In December 1982, an inquest was held by a [[Southampton]] coroner into the death of one of the aircrew, [[Lance Corporal#United Kingdom|LCpl]] Simon Cockton, after his body was repatriated to the UK. Based on the RAE Farnborough test results, the Army Air Corps submitted evidence stating that the scientific analysis of the warhead fragments found in the wreckage indicated that the helicopter had been destroyed by a type of  anti-aircraft missile "known to have been in the possession of the enemy".<ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)"/> In November 1985, a review was carried out into the RAE Farnborough test results, it concluded that there could be "no definitive conclusion as to the exact source of the missile fragments recovered from the crash site".<ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)"/> In June 1986, [[John Stanley (politician)|John Stanley]], the [[Minister of State for the Armed Forces]], announced in his written answers to the House of Commons: "the [Southampton] coroner has been informed accordingly."<ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)"/> An official board of inquiry was eventually opened in October of the same year.<ref name="MOD Memo">{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/75C709F0-0979-4BBA-B266-7B00BEE33ACD/0/boi_loss_gazellexx377_order.pdf|format=PDF|title=Convening Authority Order|author=Navy Command HQ |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]|accessdate=2008-11-19}}</ref> It lasted approximately a month and confirmed that no.&nbsp;XX377 was shot down by ''Cardiff'', but recommended "neither negligence nor blame should be attributed to any individual".<ref name="MOD board of inquiry"/> Historian [[Hugh Bicheno]] remarked: "It took [the] [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MoD]] four years and two investigations, the first either incompetent or a deliberate cover-up, even to admit the Gazelle blue-on-blue."<ref>{{cite book |author=Bicheno, Hugh |authorlink=Hugh Bicheno |title=Razor's Edge |publisher=Orion Publishing |location=London |year=2007 |pages=207 |chapter=Chapter 10 |isbn=0-7538-2186-9 }}</ref>

== Causes ==

<!-- [[Image:HMS Cardiff Sea Dart Launcher.JPG|thumb|upright|Cardiff's Sea Dart launcher the morning after the shootdown]] -->
Gazelle no.&nbsp;XX377 had an onboard [[Identification Friend or Foe]] (IFF) transmitter, however it was turned off at the time of the shootdown. The MOD board of inquiry reported: "Had IFF been in use there is little doubt that {{HMS|Cardiff|D108|6}} would not have engaged the aircraft that night."<ref name="MOD board of inquiry"/> All of the land force's helicopters were ordered not use their IFF transmitters, as they inhibited the tracking systems of the British ground based anti-aircraft missile system, [[Rapier missile|Rapier]].<ref name="MOD board of inquiry"/><ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)"/> The land forces did not inform the Royal Navy that their helicopters lacked IFF, due to a misconception of the navy's ability to engage air targets over the islands. It was this failure to inform and an assumption by the Royal Navy that all helicopters would be operating IFF, which "had a cumulative effect [and] was a major cause of [the] accident."<ref name="MOD board of inquiry"/> However the board recommended that "neither negligence nor blame should be attributed to any individual".<ref name="MOD board of inquiry"/>

The increasing role of helicopters in land force operations and the integration of [[guided missile destroyer]]s for coastal defence has forced the British government to put more emphasis on [[joint warfare]] training and technology. Military exercises focusing on joint warfare were carried out during the late 1980's in [[Oman]] and [[Scotland]], such as [[Exercise Purple Warrior|Purple Warrior]].<ref name="MOD board of inquiry"/><ref name="L/Cpl. S. J. Cockton"/> IFF transmitters are now fitted to all Army Air Corps and Royal Marine [[A<U+00E9>rospatiale Gazelle|Gazelle]] and [[Westland Lynx|Lynx]] helicopters. The problem of operating IFF in the vicinity of [[Rapier missile|Rapier]] batteries was also fixed. Additionally the board supported a recommendation that [[naval gunfire support]] liaison officers responsibilities could be broadened to include interpretation of air defence problems in joint warfare operations inshore.

A memorial was installed atop Pleasant Peak<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-towns.net/offshore/falklands/life/island_images/pleasant_peak.asp|title=Pleasant Peak War Memorial|publisher=www.british-towns.net|accessdate=2009-08-23}}</ref> and the number "205" was painted at the crash site by the soldiers of [[205 Signal Squadron]]. The number is approximately {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=on}} wide and can be seen from the air {{coord|-51.783600| -58.467786}}.
