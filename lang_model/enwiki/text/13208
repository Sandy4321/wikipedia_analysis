The '''Patcham Pylon''' is a monumental gateway erected in 1928 near [[Patcham]] in [[East Sussex]], England.  Designed by local architect [[John Leopold Denman]] and paid for by public subscription, it commemorated the extension of the County Borough of Brighton on 1 April 1928, and stood close to the new northern boundary.

The gateway consists of two stone towers known locally as "the Pylons" {{sic}}, with built-in seats around their bases.  They still stand and are clearly visible to travellers on either carriageway of the [[A23 road|A23 road to London]].  They straddle the southbound carriageway of the A23 just outside the city of [[Brighton and Hove]] and are individually [[Listed building|listed]] at Grade II.<ref name="NHLE-1381679">{{cite web|title=East Pylon, London Road, Brighton, Brighton and Hove|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1381679|year=2011|work=The National Heritage List for England|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=29 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="NHLE-1381681">{{cite web|title=West Pylon, London Road, Brighton, Brighton and Hove|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1381681|year=2011|work=The National Heritage List for England|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=29 October 2011}}</ref>

==History and symbolic role==
The Pylon was built as a symbolic gateway to Brighton and was intended to extend a welcome to travellers approaching from the north along the A23.  They were commissioned by Sir Herbert Carden, a local councillor, and were unveiled on 30 May 1928.<ref name="PSSD-JLD-Pylons">{{cite web|url=http://www.publicsculpturesofsussex.co.uk/object?id=117|title=The Pylons|work=Public Sculptures of Sussex Database|publisher=[[University of Brighton]]|accessdate=25 October 2011}}</ref>  He paid <U+00A3>2,255 towards them, and the public raised a further <U+00A3>993.  They stand either side of what was, at the time of construction, a single carriageway road.  Because the road is now a [[dual carriageway]], one pylon now "stands forlornly in the central reservation, although a third is planned".<ref name="Seldon73">{{Harvnb|Seldon|2002|p=73.}}</ref>

In the spirit of welcome, the north face of the western tower bears the inscription:<ref name="PSSD-JLD-Pylons"/><br />

The pylons and seats were [[Listed building|listed]] at Grade II by [[English Heritage]] on 26 August 1999.  Such buildings are considered to be "of special interest warranting every effort to preserve them", and "nationally important" buildings of "special interest".<ref name="EH2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/listed-buildings/|title=Listed Buildings|year=2010|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref>  As of February 2001, they were among 1,124 Grade II-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of [[Brighton and Hove]].<ref name="IoEStats-ESx">{{cite web|title=Images of England <U+2014> Statistics by County (East Sussex)|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/StatisticsPage/default.aspx?StatsCounty=EAST%20SUSSEX|work=[[Images of England]]|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|year=2007|accessdate=27 December 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DEanhkvP|archivedate=27 December 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref>

==Architecture==
The pylons are of limestone with slightly concave north and south faces.  Small [[buttress]]es protrude at the corners.  Carvings and inscriptions include the [[coat of arms]] of the Duke and Duchess of York, who laid the [[Cornerstone|foundation stone]], the emblems of Brighton and Sussex, a female figure and a galleon.  Details of the date, architect, builders, founders and other descriptive information, and a short poem, are also carved on the flat panels which are mounted on the concave faces.<ref name="NHLE-1381679"/><ref name="NHLE-1381681"/><ref name="PSSD-JLD-Pylons"/><ref name="Antram25">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=25.}}</ref>  Next to each pylon is a seat, also made of stone and wrapping around but not touching the base.  They are about {{convert|3+1/2|ft|m}} off the ground, supported on small columns, and have [[Molding (decorative)|decorative moulding]].  They are separately listed at Grade II.<ref name="NHLE-1381680">{{cite web|title=Seat next to East Pylon, London Road, Brighton, Brighton and Hove|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1381680|year=2011|work=The National Heritage List for England|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=29 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="NHLE-1381682">{{cite web|title=Seat next to West Pylon, London Road, Brighton, Brighton and Hove|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1381682|year=2011|work=The National Heritage List for England|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=29 October 2011}}</ref>
