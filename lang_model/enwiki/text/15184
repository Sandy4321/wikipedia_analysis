'''''Oryzomys nelsoni''''' is an [[extinction|extinct]] [[rodent]] of [[Mar<U+00ED>a Madre Island]], [[Nayarit]], [[Mexico]]. It may have been most closely related to the mainland species ''[[Oryzomys albiventer|O.&nbsp;albiventer]]'' within the genus ''[[Oryzomys]]'' of the family [[Cricetidae]]. Since its first description in 1898, most authors have regarded it as a distinct species, but it has also been regarded as a mere [[subspecies]] of the [[marsh rice rat]] (''O.&nbsp;palustris'').

After its discovery in 1897, it has never been recorded again and it is now considered extinct; the presence of [[introduced species|introduced]] [[black rat]]s on Mar<U+00ED>a Madre may have contributed to its extinction. ''Oryzomys nelsoni'' was a large species, distinguished in particular by its long tail, robust skull, and large [[incisor]]s. It was reddish to yellowish above and mostly white below. Its diet may have included plant material and small animals.

==Taxonomy==
''Oryzomys nelsoni'' was collected by [[Edward William Nelson]] and [[Edward Goldman]] in May 1897 and never found again.<ref>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;114; Nelson, 1899a, pp.&nbsp;7<U+2013>8</ref> Their visit for the Biological Survey of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] was one of the first scientific explorations of the islands.<ref>Nelson, 1899a, pp.&nbsp;7<U+2013>8; Merriam, 1899, p.&nbsp;13</ref> [[Clinton Hart Merriam]] identified the mammals they obtained, including four specimens of ''Oryzomys nelsoni'', which were deposited in the [[United States National Museum]] and remain there.<ref>Merriam, 1898, p.&nbsp;13; Nelson, 1899a, p.&nbsp;15; Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;122</ref> He named it as a species of the genus ''Oryzomys'', ''Oryzomys nelsoni''; the [[specific name]] honors Nelson.<ref>Merriam, 1898, p.&nbsp;15; <U+00C1>lvarez-Casta<U+00F1>eda and M<U+00E9>ndez, 2003, p.&nbsp;2</ref> Investigators have generally retained it as a species distinct from other ''Oryzomys'',<ref name=ACM1/> but in 1971 [[Philip Hershkovitz|Hershkovitz]] listed it as one of many subspecies of ''Oryzomys palustris'',<ref name=H704/> which he envisaged as a wide-ranging species encompassing what is now the [[marsh rice rat]] (''O.&nbsp;palustris'') of the southern and eastern United States, ''[[Oryzomys couesi|O.&nbsp;couesi]]'' of Central America, and several other species with more limited distributions.<ref>Musser and Carleton, 2005, pp.&nbsp;1147, 1152<U+2013>1153; Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;116</ref>

In his 1918 revision of North American ''Oryzomys'', Goldman considered ''O.&nbsp;nelsoni'' to be most closely related to the nearest mainland [[subspecies]] of ''O.&nbsp;couesi'', ''O.&nbsp;couesi mexicanus''. In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales revised the ''Oryzomys'' of western Mexico and confirmed that ''O.&nbsp;nelsoni'' is a very distinct species. Their [[morphometrics|morphometrical]] analysis found some resemblance between the species and ''[[Oryzomys albiventer]]'' of interior mainland Mexico, and they suggested that although ''O.&nbsp;nelsoni'' likely represents an old, distinctive lineage, it may have derived from a common ancestor with ''O.&nbsp;albiventer''.<ref name=CAC110>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;110</ref>

''Oryzomys nelsoni'' is one of about eight species in the genus ''Oryzomys'', which occurs from the eastern [[List of mammals of the United States|United States]] (''O.&nbsp;palustris'') into northwestern [[List of South American mammals|South America]] (''[[Oryzomys gorgasi|O.&nbsp;gorgasi]]'').<ref name=CAC106>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p. 106</ref> ''O.&nbsp;nelsoni'' is further part of the ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' section, which is centered around the widespread Central American ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions.<ref name=CAC117>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p. 117</ref> Many aspects of the [[systematics]] of the ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' section remain unclear and it is likely that the current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group.<ref name=CAC107>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p. 107</ref> ''Oryzomys'' previously included many other species, which were progressively removed in various studies culminating in a contribution by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that removed more than forty species from the genus.<ref>Weksler et al., 2006, table 1</ref> All are classified in the tribe [[Oryzomyini]] ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species,<ref>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;3</ref> and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily [[Sigmodontinae]] of family [[Cricetidae]], along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.<ref>Musser and Carleton, 2005</ref>

[[Common name]]s proposed for this species include Nelson Rice Rat,<ref name=G46>Goldman, 1918, p.&nbsp;46</ref> Nelson's Rice Rat,<ref name=ACM1><U+00C1>lvarez-Casta<U+00F1>eda and M<U+00E9>ndez, 2003, p.&nbsp;1</ref> Nelson's Oryzomys,<ref name=MC1152>Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1152</ref> and Tres Marias Island Rice Rat.<ref name=iucn/>

==Description==
[[File:Oryzomys nelsoni ventral.png|left|thumb|alt=See caption.|Skull of ''Oryzomys nelsoni'', seen from below.<ref>Goldman, 1918, plate&nbsp;II, fig.&nbsp;1a</ref>]]
''Oryzomys nelsoni'' was a large and long-tailed ''Oryzomys'';<ref name=ACM1/> its tail was longer than that of any other western Mexican ''Oryzomys''.<ref name=CAC122/> The upperparts were [[wikt:ochraceous|ochraceous]] to [[wikt:buff|buff]], most richly so on the rump, and paler further to the front and low on the flanks. On the head and the back, blackish hairs somewhat darkened the overall color. The underparts were white, with lead-colored underfur that was visible in some places. The ears were covered on both sides with scanty grayish hairs.<ref name=ACM1/> The large hindfeet<ref name=CAC122/> were sparsely covered with pale hairs. The tail was largely dark, but the underside of the basal one third to one half was light yellow.<ref name=ACM1/>

''Oryzomys nelsoni'' was distinctive in its large skull with broad, well-developed [[incisor]]s and a strong front part (rostrum) that is strongly curved downwards.<ref name=CAC121>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;121</ref> In ''O.&nbsp;albiventer'', the rostrum and incisors were not as massive, but the molars are larger.<ref name=CAC122/> The [[interparietal]] bone, part of the roof of the [[braincase]], was broad and the [[incisive foramen|incisive foramina]], which perforated the [[palate]] between the incisors and the [[molar (tooth)|molars]], were relatively short.<ref name=ACM1/>

Total length in the four known specimens is 282 to 344&nbsp;mm (11.1 to 13.5&nbsp;in), averaging 322&nbsp;mm (12.7&nbsp;in); head and body length is 122 to 153&nbsp;mm (4.8 to 6.0&nbsp;in), averaging 140.5&nbsp;mm (5.53&nbsp;in); tail length is 160 to 191&nbsp;mm (6.3 to 7.5&nbsp;in), averaging 181.5&nbsp;mm (7.15&nbsp;in); and hindfoot length is 35 to 39&nbsp;mm (1.4 to 1.5&nbsp;in), averaging 37.3&nbsp;mm (1.47&nbsp;in).<ref name=CACt2>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, table&nbsp;2</ref>

==Ecology and extinction==
Nelson and Goldman found the species only in a damp, herbaceous site now known as the "Sacatal" near a spring high on [[Mar<U+00ED>a Madre Island]], the largest of the [[Islas Mar<U+00ED>as]] off the coast of [[Nayarit]], western Mexico,<ref><U+00C1>lvarez-Casta<U+00F1>eda and M<U+00E9>ndez, 2003, p.&nbsp;1; Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;114</ref> and Nelson wrote that it was rare. He gave the elevation of this place as 1800&nbsp;ft,<ref name=N16>Nelson, 1899b, p.&nbsp;16</ref> which <U+00C1>lvarez-Casta<U+00F1>eda and M<U+00E9>ndez converted to 550&nbsp;m,<ref name=ACM1/> but in his 1918 paper, Goldman gave 800&nbsp;ft instead,<ref name=G46/> which Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales in 2009 converted to 245&nbsp;m.<ref name=CAC114>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;114</ref> The next survey of small mammals on the island took place in March 1976 by a team led by [[Don Wilson]]. They failed to collect ''O.&nbsp;nelsoni'' and instead found only the [[introduced species|introduced]] [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus'') at the locality where Nelson and Goldman had collected ''O.&nbsp;nelsoni''; this species may have contributed to the decline of the indigenous rodent.<ref>Wilson, 1991, p.&nbsp;239; Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;114</ref> 

The species is now considered extinct,<ref><U+00C1>lvarez-Casta<U+00F1>eda and M<U+00E9>ndez, 2003, p.&nbsp;1; Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1152; Timm et al., 2008; Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;114</ref> although as late as 2002 the Mexican government listed it as "threatened".<ref name=ACM2><U+00C1>lvarez-Casta<U+00F1>eda and M<U+00E9>ndez, 2003, p.&nbsp;2</ref> Another Islas Mar<U+00ED>as [[endemism|endemic]], the [[deermouse]] ''[[Peromyscus madrensis]]'', still occurred on Mar<U+00ED>a Madre in 1976.<ref>Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1071; Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;114</ref> ''Oryzomys nelsoni'' is thought to have fed on plant material such as weeds, fruit, and seeds, and more rarely on animals such as fish and invertebrates.<ref name=ACM1/>
