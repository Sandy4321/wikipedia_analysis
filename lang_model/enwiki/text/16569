The '''economy of the ancient Tamil country''' ([[Sangam era]]: 200 BCE <U+2013> 200 CE) describes the ancient economy of a region in [[South India|southern India]] that covers the present-day states of [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].  The main economic activities were agriculture, weaving, [[pearl hunting|pearl fishery]], manufacturing and construction. [[Paddy fields|Paddy]] <!--I was thinking "paddy" was an actual crop until I saw the piped link: you're referring to a mode of agriculture? "Paddy cropping" or "Paddy crops".-->was the most important crop; it was the staple cereal and served as a medium of exchange for inland<!--"domestic trade"? If you change it, do so below, too.--> trade. [[Black pepper|Pepper]], [[millet]]s, grams and [[sugarcane]] were other commonly grown crops. [[Madurai]] and [[Urayur]] were important centers for the [[Textile|textile industry]]; [[Korkai]] was the center of the pearl trade. Industrial activity flourished<!--I removed "in this age" as redundant; but it's too stubby anyway<U+2014>you give the centres for these agricultural activities; where were the industrial centres? US spelling? That's OK, but I'm just surprised. We know what sugarcane is, so why is it linked whereas the unfamiliar "gram" is not?-->. 

Inland trading was conducted primarily through [[barter]] in busy market places by merchant associations and commercial lending institutions<!--The lenders conducted trade? I'd have thought they played a secondary role, enabling others to conduct it-->. Merchants formed associations that operated autonomously, without interference from the state. The people of ancient Tamil country engaged in brisk overseas trade with [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]; the trade reached a peak after the discovery of a direct route for merchant ships between Tamilakam and [[Egypt]],<!--in [year or decade or part of century?]-->, taking advantage of  the [[monsoon|monsoon winds]]. Pepper, pearls, ivory, textiles and gold ornaments were exported from Tamilakam, and the main imports were luxury goods such as glass, [[coral]], wine and [[topaz]]. Foreign trade brought in a large amount of internationally convertible [[Roman currency]]. 

The state played an important role in building and maintaining [[infrastructure]] such as roads and ports<U+2014>funded through taxation<U+2014>to meet the needs of economic and social activity. Wealth was unequally divided among the people, giving rise to distinct economic classes.

  |work = [[Thirukkural]]}}</ref> Farmers were aware of different soil types, the best crops to grow and the various irrigation systems suitable for any given region. In the five geographical divisions of the Tamil country in [[Sangam]] literature, the [[Sangam landscape#Marutham .E2.80.93 Cropland|Marutam]] region was the most fit for cultivation, as it had the most fertile lands. Land was classified, according to its fertility, as ''Menpulam'' (fertile land), ''Pinpulam'' (dry land), ''Vanpulam'' (hardland) and ''Kalarnilam'' or ''Uvarnilam'' (salty land). ''Menpulam'' yielded rich produce on a variety of crops, but  ''Pinpulam'' was cultivated only with dry crops due to limited irrigation facilities. The yield from ''Vanpulam'' was limited, while ''Kalarnilam'' was unfit for cultivation. Some of the well known types of soil were [[alluvial soil]], red soil, [[black soil]], laterite soil and sandy soil.<ref name="Balambal_classification">{{cite book

Paddy was the main crop, with different varieties grown in the wetland of Marutam, such as ''Vennel'', ''Sennel'', ''Pudunel'', ''Aivananel'' and ''Torai''. The peasants lived in groves of trees close to the farmlands and each house had [[jackfruit|jack]], coconut, [[palmyra palm|palm]], [[arecanut|areca]] and plantain trees.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} Peasants grew [[turmeric]] plants in front of their houses and laid flower gardens in between the houses.

Most farmers  cultivated their own plots of land and were known by different names such as ''Ulutunbar'', ''Yerinvalnar'', ''Vellalar'', ''Karalar''  and ''Kalamar''.<ref>Balambal, p. 61</ref> There were also [[absentee landlords]] who were mostly [[brahmin]]s and poets who had received donations of land from the king and  who gave these donations to [[tenant farmer]]s. Sometimes independent farm laborers, known as ''Adiyor'', were hired for specific  tasks. Landlords and [[peasants]] paid tax on the land and its produce &ndash; the [[Land value tax|land tax]] was known as ''Irai'' or ''Karai'' and the tax on produce was called ''Vari''.  One sixth of the produce was collected as tax.<ref name="Balambal_administration">{{cite book

Produce was measured using cubic-measures such as ''Tuni'', ''Nali'', ''Cher'' and ''Kalam'' and weight-measures such as ''Tulam'' and ''Kalanju''.

==Industry==
{{mainarticle|Industry in ancient Tamil country}}
During the [[Sangam period|Sangam age]], crafts and trade occupations were considered secondary to agriculture. Carpenters crafted wooden wares and blacksmiths worked in simple workshops. Weaving, [[Pearl hunting|pearl fishing]], smithy and [[Shipbuilding|ship building]] were prominent industries of ancient [[Tamilakam]]. Spinning and weaving was a source of income for craftsmen; weaving was practised part-time by the farmers in rural areas. [[Madurai]] and [[Urayur]] were important industrial centers, known for their cotton textiles. Muslin cloth was woven with fine floral work of different colors. Silk cloth was manufactured with its threads gathered in small knots at its ends. Clothing was  embroidered for the nobles and aristocrats who were the main customers. Material was often dyed; the blue dye for the [[Loincloth|loin cloth]] was a favorite color. In addition to silk and cotton fabrics, cloth made of [[wood fibre]] called ''Sirai Maravuri'' and ''Naarmadi''  was used by the priestly class.<ref name=venkatasubramanian_trade>{{cite book

The textile dealers then scissored off bits of required length, called ''aruvai'' or ''tuni'', at the time of sale. Hence, the dealers were called ''aruvai vanigar'' and the localities where they lived ''aruvai vidi''.

Pearl fishing  flourished during the Sangam age. The Pandyan port city of Korkai was the center of the pearl trade. Written records from Greek and Egyptian voyagers give details of the pearl fisheries off the Pandyan coast. According to one account, the fishermen who dove into the sea avoided attacks from sharks by bringing up the right-whorled [[conch]] and blowing on the shell.<ref>{{cite web

The [[blacksmith]], working in the ''Panikkalari'' (literally: workplace), played an important role in the lives of ancient Tamils. Some of the essential items produced by blacksmiths  were weapons of war, tools such as the plough, domestic utensils and  iron wheels.  They used a blow pipe or a pair of bellows (a ''turutti'') to light the fire used for smelting and welding. There were not many blacksmith shops in the rural areas. Blacksmiths were overworked as they had to serve the needs of  neighboring villages.<ref name=subrahmanian_trade2>{{cite book

Among the smaller crafts were ''ambi'' and ''padagu''  used as ferries  to cross rivers and the ''timil'', a [[fishing boat]]. ''Pahri'', ''Odam'', ''Toni'', ''Teppa'', and ''Navai'' were smaller craft. The large ship, called ''Kappal'', had masts (''Paamaram'') and sails (''Poy'').<ref name=sundararajan_trade>{{cite book

==Inland trade==
Ancient Tamils were active traders in various commodities, both locally and outside Tamil country. The kingdoms of [[northern India]] sought pearls, cotton fabrics and conch shells from Tamilakam in exchange for woollen clothing, hides and horses.<ref name=krishnamurthy_trade>{{cite book
 | last = Krishnamurthy
 | title =
 | pages = pp. 5-6}}</ref> Locally most trading was in  food products &ndash;  agricultural produce was supplemented by products from hunters, fishermen and shepherds  who traded in meat, fish and diary products. In addition, people bought other goods such as items for personal hygiene, adornment and transportation. Mercantile transactions took place in busy market places. Traders used various modes of selling: hawking their goods from [[Door-to-door|door to door]], setting up shops in busy market places or stationing themselves at royal households. Sellers of fish, salt and grain hawked their goods, the textile merchants sold cloths from their shops in urban markets and the goldsmith, the [[lapidary]] and sellers of sandlewood and ivory patronised   the  aristocrats' quarters.<ref name=venkatasubramanian_trade> </ref> Merchants dealt in conches and ivory. 

Most trade was  by barter. Paddy was the most commonly accepted medium of exchange, followed by purified salt. Honey and roots were exchanged for fish liver oil and arrack, while sugarcane and rice flakes were traded for venison and toddy. Poems in ''[[Purananuru]]'' describe the prosperous house in [[Pandya]] land  well stocked with paddy that the housewife had exchanged for grams and fish. Artisans and professionals traded their services for goods.<ref name=sivathamby_trade> </ref> Quantities were measured by weighing balance, called the ''Tulakkol'' named after ''Tulam'', the standard weight. Delicate balances made of ivory were used by the goldsmiths for measures of ''Urai'', ''Nali'' and ''Ma''.<ref name=venkatasubramanian_trade2>{{cite book
 | last = Venkata Subramanian
 | title =
 | pages = p. 87}}</ref> A different kind of barter involving deferred exchange was known as ''Kuri edirppai'' &ndash;  this involved taking a loan for a fixed quantity of a commodity to be repaid by the same quantity of the same commodity at a later date. Since barter was prevalent locally, coins were used almost exclusively for foreign trade. 

===Markets===

 | last = Subrahmanian
 | title = Sangam Polity
 | pages = pp. 244-245}}</ref> According to the Mathuraikkanci, the great market was held in a large square and the items sold included garlands of flowers, fragrant pastes, coats with metallic belts, leather sandals, weapons, shields, carts, chariots and ornamented chariot steps. Garment shops sold clothing of various colours and patterns made of cotton, silk or wool, with the merchandise neatly arranged in rows. On the grain merchants' street, sacks of pepper and sixteen kinds of grains (including paddy, millet, gram, peas and [[Sesame|sesame seeds]]) were heaped by the side. The jewellers, who conducted business from a separate street, sold precious articles such as diamonds, [[pearl]]s, [[emerald]]s, [[ruby|rubies]], [[sapphire]]s, [[topaz]], coral beads and varieties of gold.<ref name=husaini_maduraikanci> </ref>

Vanchi, the capital of the [[Cheras]], was a typical fortified city, with two divisions inside the fort &ndash; the ''Puranakar'' and the ''Akanakar''. The Puranakar was the outer city adjacent to the fort wall and was occupied by the soldiers. The Akanakar,  the inner city, included the king's palace and the officers' quarters. The city market was located between these two divisions; the artisans and traders lived close to the market.<ref name=venkat_vanchi>{{cite book
 | last = Venkata Subramanian
 | title =
 | pages = pp. 75-76, 80}}</ref> Kaveripumpattinam, the port city of the [[Cholas]], had its market in a central open area close to the two main suburbs of the city &ndash; ''Maruvurpakkam'' and ''Pattinapakkam''. Maruvurpakkam was adjacent to the sea where the fishermen and the foreign merchants lived. The main streets of the market met at the centre where there was a temple dedicated to the local guardian deity of the city.<ref name=venkat_puhar>{{cite book
 | last = Venkata Subramanian
 | title =
 | pages = pp. 71, 80}}</ref> 

The market of Kaveripumpattinam was similar to the one in Madurai. Large quantities of dyes, scented powder, flowers, textiles, salt, fish and sheep were sold. Flowers were in great demand, especially during festivals such as ''Indira vizha''. Near the [[bazaar]] were warehouses with little ventilation  located underground.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} Since merchants from various places thronged the bazaar, each package for sale had the name and details of its owner written on it. Simple advertisements were used to indicate the goods available at different locations.<ref>{{cite book

===Mercantile organization===
There were different types of merchants who operated in the ancient Tamil market, which gave rise to a wealth-based class distinction among them. Merchants in the lower levels of the hierarchy were of two varieties: the [[itinerant]] merchants who sold goods that they manufactured themselves and the retailers who sold goods manufactured by others. Itinerant traders were found in both the rural and urban markets, but the retailers were concentrated in the cities. In the rural markets, salt and grain merchants usually produced the goods, transported them and sold them directly to the consumers. Salt merchants, known as ''umanar'', travelled with their families in trains of carts.<ref name=venkatasubramanian_trade> </ref> In the cities, artisans such as the blacksmiths and the oil mongers sold their products directly to the consumers. The bulk of the retailers operated in the textile industry. The textile dealers (''aruvai vanigar'') bought their products from the weavers (''karugar'') and resold them to the consumers. Merchants selling agricultural produce in the cities were also retailers. At the upper end of the merchant hierarchy, were the rich merchants who participated in the export trade. There were three classes among them - ''ippar'', ''kavippar'' and ''perunkudi'' - based on the extent of their wealth; the ''perunkudi'' made up the wealthiest class. Foreign merchants, mainly Romans, also did business in the Tamil markets &ndash; not just in the port cities, but in in-land cities such as Madurai, where they exchanged indigenous goods for their offerings.{{unclear}} Another category of merchants were the intermediaries or the brokers, who acted as information channels and offered their services mainly to the foreign merchants.<ref>{{cite book

[[Image:AugustusCoinPudukottaiHoardIndia.jpg|thumb|Coin of Roman Emperor Augustus found in Pudukkottai]]
Merchants organized themselves into groups called ''Sattu'' or ''Nikama''. Stone inscriptions at [[Mangulam]] (c. [[200 BC]]E) and pottery inscriptions found at Kodumanal refer to merchant guilds as ''nikama'' and the members of the guilds as ''nikamattor''. These findings suggest that merchant guilds were established at several industrial and trade centres of ancient Tamil country.<ref name=mahadevan_trade>{{cite book

 | title =
 | pages = p. 141}}</ref> Many of these merchant associations acted in union in their public activities. They were autonomous, meaning that they enjoyed freedom from state interference but also suffered from the lack of state backing. Merchants were expected to abide by a code of conduct, which was: "Refuse to take more than your due and never stint giving to others their due".{{Fact|date=August 2007}} Therefore, they went about running their business by openly announcing the profit they were aiming at, known as ''Utiyam''.<ref>{{cite book

==Foreign trade==
The economic prosperity of the Tamils depended on foreign trade. Literary, archaeological and numismatic sources confirm the trade relationship between Tamilakam and Rome, where spices and pearls from India were in great demand. With the accession of [[Augustus]] in 27 BCE, trade between Tamilakam and Rome received a tremendous boost and culminated at the time of [[Nero]] who died in 68 CE. At that point, trade declined until the death of [[Caracalla]] (217 CE), after which it almost ceased. It was revived again under the [[Byzantine]] emperors. Under the early [[Roman Emperor|Roman emperors]], there was a great demand for articles of luxury, especially [[beryl]].  Most of the articles of luxury mentioned by the Roman writers came from Tamilakam. In the declining period, cotton and industrial products were still imported by Rome.<ref name=husaini_trade1>{{cite book

===Trade route===
[[Image:PeriplusMap.jpg|thumb|[[Trade route]] between Rome and Tamilakam, according to the [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]].]]
The [[trade route]] taken by ships from Rome to  Tamilakam has been described in detail by writers such as [[Strabo]] and [[Pliny]]. Roman and Arab sailors were aware of the existence of the monsoon winds that blew across the [[Indian Ocean]] on a  seasonal basis. A Roman captain named [[Hippalus]]  first sailed  a direct route from Rome to India, using the monsoon winds. His method was later improved upon by merchants who shortened the voyage by sailing due east from the port of Cana or [[Cape Guardafui]], finding that by this way it was possible to go directly from Rome to Tamilakam. Strabo writes that every year, about the time of the summer solstice, a fleet of one hundred and twenty vessels sailed from [[Myos Hormos]], a port of [[Egypt]] on the [[Red Sea]], and headed toward India. With  assistance from the monsoons, the voyage  took   forty days to reach the ports of Tamilakam or Ceylon. Pliny writes that if the monsoons were blowing regularly, it was a forty day trip to  [[Muziris]] (Musiri) from [[Ocelis]] located at the entrance to the Red Sea from the south. He  writes that the passengers preferred to embark at Bacare (Vaikkarai) in Pandya country, rather than Musiri, which was infested with [[pirates]]. The ships returned from Tamilakam carrying  rich cargo which was transported in [[camel train]]s from the Red Sea to the [[Nile]], then up the river to [[Alexandria]], finally reaching the capital of [[Roman Empire|the Roman empire]].<ref name="husaini_trade2">{{cite book

===Imports and exports===
Fine [[muslin]]s and jewels, especially beryls (''vaiduriyam'') and [[pearl]]s were exported from Tamilakam for personal adornment. Drugs, spices and condiments as well as [[Costus speciosus|crape ginger]] and other cosmetics fetched high prices. Even greater was the  demand for pepper which, according to Pliny, sold at the price of 15 [[denarii]] (silver pieces) a pound. [[Sapphire]], called ''kurrandam'' in Tamil, and a variety of [[ruby]] were also exported. The other articles exported from Tamilakam were [[ivory]], [[spikenard]], [[betel]], diamonds, [[amethysts]] and [[Tortoiseshell material|tortoise shell]]. The Greek and Arabic names for rice (''Oryza'' and ''urz''), ginger(''Gingibar'' and ''zanjabil'') and cinnamon (''Karpion'' and ''quarfa'') are almost identical with their Tamil names, ''arisi'', ''inchiver'' and ''karuva''.<ref name=husaini_trade3>{{cite book

===Foreign exchange===
[[Image:AugustusIndianImitation1stCenturyCE.jpg|thumb|left|Local imitation of a coin of Augustus, c. 1st century AD.]]
The flourishing trade with the  Romans had a substantial impact on the economy of ancient Tamil country and the royal treasury and the export traders accumulated  large sums of Roman currency. Pliny writes that [[India]], [[China]] and [[Arabia]] between them absorbed  one hundred million [[sesterce]]s per annum from Rome. This sum is calculated by [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]] to represent 1,100,000 pounds, of which nearly half went to India, the preponderance to  [[South India]].<ref name=husaini_coins>{{cite book

Coins hoarded by the early Roman emperors from [[Augustus]] to [[Nero]] have been found in the vicinity of the South Indian [[beryl]] mines which produced the best and purest beryl in the world. At fifty-five different locations, mostly in [[Coimbatore]] and [[Madurai]] districts,   these coins have been unearthed; the number of gold coins discovered has been described as a quantity amounting to five coolly loads. The quantity of silver coins  has been variously described  as "a great many in a pot", "about 500 in an earthen pot", "a find of 163 coins", "some thousands enough to fill five or six Madras measures".{{Fact|date=August 2007}} Coins of all the Roman emperors from Augustus (27 BCE) to [[Alexander Severus]] (235 CE]) have been discovered, covering a period of nearly three centuries. By far the greatest number of these Roman coins belong to the reigns of Augustus and [[Tiberius]]. After 235 CE, for the next one hundred years, there are no coins that can be dated, suggesting a temporary abeyance of trade between Rome and [[South India]]. This could have been due to internal revolts and external attacks suffered by the Roman empire during that period. When order and good government were restored in Rome, trade with Tamilakam  revived, as indicated by the finding of an increased number of  coins from this period. [[Zeno]]<U+2019>s coins have been traced to  the end of the Roman empire. Scholars believe there was a Roman settlement near Madurai and that little copper coins with the Roman Emperors' heads on them might have been minted locally.<ref name=husaini_coins> </ref>

==Role of the state==
The role of the state in trade related to two aspects: first, to provide an adequate infrastructure necessary to sustain the trade and second, to organise an efficient administrative apparatus for taxation.<ref name=mukund_state>{{cite book

During the Sangam period, the main [[trade route]]s, such those going over the [[Western Ghats]], went through thick forests. It was the duty of the state to protect the merchant caravans on these trade routes from robbers and wild life. Main roads, known as ''Peruvali'', were built that connected the distant parts of the country. These roads were as important to the army  as they were to the merchants. Commodities like salt had to be transported long distances, such as from the sea coast to the interior villages. The state also built and expanded the infrastructure for shipping such as ports, [[lighthouse]]s and [[warehouse]]s near the ports to promote overseas trade. Several ports were constructed on both the east and the west coasts of Tamilakam. [[Kaveripumpattinam]] (also known as ''Puhar'') was the chief port of the [[Cholas]]; their other ports were [[Nagapattinam]], [[Marakkanam]] and [[Arikamedu]], all on the east coast. The [[Pandyas]] had developed Korkai, Saliyur, Kayal, Marungurpattinam (present day Alagankulam) and Kumari (present day [[Kanyakumari]]) as their centers of trade along the east coast, while Niranam and Vilinam were their west coast ports. Musiri, Tondi, Marandai, Naravu, Varkkalai and Porkad were the principal ports of the [[Cheras]], all of them  on the west coast.<ref name="krishnamurthy_ports">{{cite book

To collect revenue from commerce, the state installed [[customs]] checkposts (''sungachavadi'') along the highways and the ports. In the ports, duty was collected on inland goods, before being exported, and on overseas goods meant for the local markets, which were stamped with the official seal before being allowed into the country. The volume of trade in the port cities was high enough to warrant a large workforce to monitor and assess the goods. The state issued licenses to [[liquor]] shops, which were required to fly the license flag outside their premises. Flags were used by foreign merchants too, to indicate the nature of goods they were selling. The state also kept records of the weights and counts of all the goods sold by merchants. One of the significant aspects of the state intervention in commerce was that it reinforced the authority of the ruler.<ref name=mukund_state> </ref>

==Personal wealth==
How wealth was assessed  varied from one community to another. Farmers counted the number of [[ploughshare]]s owned and among the pastoral folk it was the number of cows. Wealth was distributed unequally among the people, leading to distinct economic classes - the rich, the poor and the middle class. The nobility, state officers, export traders and court poets formed the wealthy class. Most agriculturists and inland merchants made up the middle class. The lowest class consisted of labourers and wandering [[minstrel]]s. It was believed that this economic division of people was the result of a divine arrangement; the poor people were made to feel that their miserable condition was due to their past [[sin]]s, ''tivinai'', and was inevitable.<ref name=subrahmanian_poverty>{{cite book
 | last = Subrahmanian
 | title = Sangam Polity
 | pages = p. 232}}</ref> The extreme opulence of some people as well as the abject poverty of some others are clearly portrayed in the contemporary literature. Most of the rich spent a part of their wealth on charity, the king's philanthropy setting an example. It was believed that one needed to accumulate wealth in order to give donations and perform righteous obligations. Sometimes, the men of the household undertook a long journey to the north of the [[Venkata|Venkata Hill]] or the northern boundary of Tamilakam, to earn wealth. One possible region that they might have gone to is the [[Mysore (region)|Mysore region]], where the gold mines were getting famous. F.R. Allchin, who has discussed the antiquity of [[gold mining]] in the Deccan, says that the high period of mining in South India was the last centuries of the pre-Christian era and the first two centuries of the [[Anno Domini|Christian era]], which coincides with the Sangam period.<ref name=sivathamby_wealth>{{cite book

{{mainarticle|Sources of ancient Tamil history}}
The most important source of ancient [[Tamil people|Tamil]] history is the corpus of [[Tamil language|Tamil]] poems, referred to as [[Sangam literature]], dated between the last centuries of the pre-[[Christian era]] and the early centuries of the Christian era.<ref name=subrahmanian_tamilsource>{{cite book

The ''akam'' poems deal with inner human emotions such as love, while the ''puram'' poems deal with outer experiences such as society, culture and warfare. These poems contain descriptions of various aspects of life in the ancient Tamil country. The ''[[Maduraikkanci]]'' by Mankudi Maruthanaar and the ''[[Netunalvatai]]'' by Nakkirar contain a detailed description of the Pandyan capital [[Madurai]], the king's palace and the rule of Nedunj Cheliyan, the victor of the Talaialanganam battle.<ref name="sastri2_maduraikanci">{{cite book

The ''[[Pathirruppaththu]]'' provides the genealogy of two collateral lines of the Cheras and describes the Chera country. The ''[[Pattinappaalai]]'' talks about the riches of the Chola port city of [[Kaveripumpattinam]] and the economic activities in the city. The historical value of the Sangam poems has been critically analysed by scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries. Historians agree that the descriptions of society, culture and economy in the poems are authentic, for the most part: many eminent scholars including Sivaraja Pillay, Kanakasabhai, K.A.N Sastri and George Hart have used information from these poems to describe the ancient Tamil society.<ref name=sivaraj_reliability>{{cite book

Among literary sources in other languages, the most informative ones are Greek and Roman accounts of the maritime trade between the Roman empire and the kingdoms of Tamilakam. [[Strabo]] and [[Pliny]] give the details of the trade route between the Red Sea coast and the western coast of [[South India]]. Strabo (ca. 1st century BCE) mentions the embassies sent by the Pandyas to the court of Augustus, along with a description of the ambassadors. Pliny (ca. 77 CE) talks about the different items imported by the Romans from India and complains about the financial drain caused by them. He also refers to many Tamil ports in his work ''The Natural History''. The [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]] (c. 60 - 100 CE) an anonymous work, gives an elaborate description of the Tamil country and the riches of a 'Pandian Kingdom'.

[[Archaeological]] excavations at many sites in Tamil Nadu including Arikamedu, Kodumanal, Kaveripumpattinam and Alagankulam,  have yielded a  variety of artifacts belonging to the Sangam era, such as various types of pottery and other items including  black and red ware, rouletted ware,  Russet coated ware, brick walls, ring wells, pits, industrial items,  and the remains of seeds and shells.<ref>Begley, p. 461</ref><ref>Rajan, p. 57</ref><ref> Tripati et al., pp. 86, 89</ref><ref>Gaur and Sundaresh, pp. 126-7</ref> Many of the pottery sherds contain Tamil-Brahmic inscriptions on them, which have provided additional evidence for the archaeologist to date them. Archaeologists agree that activities best illustrated in these material records are trade, hunting, agriculture and crafts.<ref>Abraham, p. 219</ref> These excavations have provided evidence for the existence of the major economic activities mentioned in Sangam literature. Remnants of irrigation structures like reservoirs and ring wells and charred remains of seeds attest to the cultivation of different varieties of crops and knowledge of various agricultural techniques.<ref>Cooke et al., pp. 342-3, 348-9</ref><ref>Tripati et al., pp. 86-88</ref><ref>Gaur and Sundaresh, p. 124</ref><ref>Begley, p. 472</ref> Spinning whorls, cotton seeds, remains of a woven cotton cloth and dyeing vats provide evidence for the activities of the textile industry.<ref>Rajan, p. 67</ref><ref>Begley, p. 475</ref> Metallurgy has been supported by the discovery of an ancient blast furnace, along with its base and wall, anvil, slags and crucibles. The remains have indicated that, in addition to iron, the blacksmith may have worked with steel, lead, copper and bronze.<ref>Rajan, pp. 65-66, 95, 98-102</ref> The Kodumanal excavation recovered several jewellery items and semi precious stones at different stages of manufacture, suggesting that they were locally manufactured.<ref>Rajan, pp. 66-67</ref> Remains of import and export articles recovered from Arikamedu indicate the important role it played as an Indo-Roman trading station.<ref>Begley, pp. 472, 480</ref> Building construction, pearl fishery and painting are other activities that have been supported by findings from these excavations.<ref>Tripati et al., pp. 86, 88-89</ref><ref>Begley, p. 472</ref><ref>Gaur and Sundaresh, p. 127</ref><ref>Rajan, p. 141</ref>

Inscriptions are another source of deducing ancient Tamil history: most of them are written in Tamil-Brahmi script and found on rocks or pottery. The inscriptions have been used to corroborate some of the details provided by the Sangam literature. Cave inscriptions found at places such as Mangulam and Alagarmalai near Madurai, Edakal hill in Kerala and Jambai village in Villupuram district record various donations made by the kings and chieftains.<ref>Mahadevan, pp. 7-24</ref> Brief mentions of various aspects of the Sangam society such as agriculture, trade, commodities, occupations and names of cities are found in these inscriptions.<ref>Mahadevan, pp. 115-159</ref> Several coins issued by the Tamil kings of this age have been recovered from river beds and urban centers of their kingdoms. Most of them carry the emblem of the corresponding dynasty, such as the bow and arrow of the Cheras; some of them contain portraits and written legends. Numismatists have used these coins to establish the existence of the Tamil kingdoms during the Sangam age and associate the kings mentioned in the legends to a specific period.<ref>Krishnamurthy, pp. 20-23, 97-107, 132-148</ref> A large number of Roman coins have been found in Coimbatore and Madurai districts, providing more evidence for the brisk maritime trade between Rome and Tamilakam.<ref>Husaini, pp. 20-21</ref>
