=== Brescia ===
The '''Sack of Brescia''' took place on February 18, 1512 during the [[War of the League of Cambrai]].  The city of [[Brescia]] had revolted against [[France|French]] control, garrisoning itself with [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] troops.  [[Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours|Gaston de Foix]], recently arrived to command the French armies in Italy, ordered the city to surrender; when it refused, he attacked it with around 12,000 men.  The French attack took place in a pouring rain, through a field of mud; Foix ordered his men to remove their shoes for better traction.<ref>Baumgartner, ''Louis XII'', 220.</ref>  The defenders inflicted heavy casualties on the French, but were eventually overrun, suffering 8,000 <U+2013> 15,000 casualties.<ref>Baumgartner, ''Louis XII'', 220; Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 421.  Baumgartner gives 8,000 as a minimal estimate, while Norwich gives 15,000.</ref>.  The [[Gascony|Gascon]] infantry and [[landsknechts]] then proceeded to thoroughly sack the city, massacring thousands of civilians over the next five days.  Following this, the city of [[Bergamo]] paid some 60,000 [[ducat]]s to the French to avoid a similar fate.

=== Guinegate ===
The '''Battle of Guinegate''' or '''Battle of the Spurs''' took place on August 16, 1513. As part of the [[War of the League of Cambrai|Holy League]] under the on-going [[Italian Wars]], English and [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] troops under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] surprised and routed a body of French cavalry under [[Jacques de La Palice]].

The English army was provided by Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]] and combined several different types of martial forces, and included [[cavalry]], [[artillery]], [[infantry]] and [[longbow]]s using hardened steel arrows designed to penetrate armour more effectively. The French forces were mostly companies of [[gendarme (historical)|gendarmes]] and [[pikemen]], with some other mixed forces as well.

Called the "Battle of the Spurs" because of the haste of the French horse to leave the battlefield, it took place at [[Guinegate]] (now ''Enguinegatte'', [[France]]), hence its name:

{{bquote|A French cavalry force, which had come to succour the besieged town of Therouanne, suddenly found itself opposite the Anglo-Imperial army, the size and position of which it had misjudged.  Repelled by the latter<U+2019>s artillery, the French turned and fled, with English and Burgundian cavalry in hot pursuit.''[http://www.hrp.org.uk/NewsAndMedia/youngHenry.aspx]}}

At the end of the battle the cities of [[Therouanne]] and [[Tournai]] were in the hands of Henry VIII of England.

=== Flodden Field ===
{{details|Battle of Flodden Field}}

The kingdoms of [[Early Modern France|France]] and [[Scotland in the Late Middle Ages|Scotland]] had traditionally enjoyed a [[Auld Alliance|close diplomatic relationship]], reflected in a defensive treaty signed between the two kingdoms in 1512. When [[Henry VIII|Henry]] crossed the [[English Channel]] to campaign in [[Early Modern France|France]], the [[Louis XII of France|King of France]] activated the treaty, sending arms, money and military advisers to [[James IV of Scotland]] to encourage him to fulfil his obligations, in the hope that this would draw English resources away from the invasion of [[Early Modern France|France]]. [[James IV of Scotland|James]] crossed the border with a force of some 35,000 men, including 5,000 French advisers<ref>Guest, Ken, and Denise Guest, ''British Battles'', p. 80</ref>. He was opposed by an English force under [[Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk|the Earl of Surrey]]. The two sides met on 9th September, 1513, near the village of Flodden. The Scottish army was heavily defeated, losing some 9,000 men and many nobles, including [[James IV of Scotland|King James]], the King's [[Alexander Stewart (Archbishop of St Andrews)|illegitimate son]], and twelve [[Earl|earls]].<ref>Guest, Ken, and Denise Guest, ''British Battles'', p. 85</ref>

=== La Motta ===
The '''Battle of La Motta''', also known as the '''Battle of Schio''', '''Battle of Vicenza''' or '''Battle of Creazzo''', which took place on October 7, 1513 between the [[Republic of Venice]] and [[Spain]], was a significant battle of the [[War of the League of Cambrai]].  A Venetian army under [[Bartolomeo d'Alviano]] attempted to prevent the Spanish under [[Ramon de Cardona]] from withdrawing from the [[Veneto]], but was defeated and scattered.

{{details|Italian War of 1521<U+2013>1526}}

=== Pampeluna ===
The '''Battle of Pampeluna''' (also spelled [[Pamplona]]) occurred on May 20, 1521, between [[France|French]]-backed [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarrese]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] troops, during the [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre]] and in the context of the [[Italian War of 1521<U+2013>1526]]. Most Navarrese towns rised at once against the Spanish, who had [[Kingdom of Navarre#Castilian conquest|invaded Navarre]] in 1512. The Spanish resisted the siege sheltered inside the city castle, but they eventually surrendered and the Navarrese took control of the town and the castle of Pamplona.

It was at this battle that Inigo Lopez de Loyola, better known as [[St. Ignatius of Loyola]], suffered severe injuries, a French cannonball shattering his leg. His meditations during his long recovery set him on the road of a conversion of life from soldier to priest. He would eventually found the [[Society of Jesus]] (the Jesuits), and create the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]], which is the basis for the idea of "retreats" as an experience of prayer as practiced in the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

=== Noain-Esquiroz ===
The '''Battle of Noain-Esquiroz''' was fought near [[Pamplona]] on June 30, 1521, during the [[Italian War of 1521]].  A makeshift [[Spain|Spanish]] army consisting mostly of [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] troops defeated the Navarrese and [[France|French]] forces under [[Henry d'Albret]] and Lesparre, driving them out of Iberian [[Navarre]].

=== M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res ===
The '''Siege of M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res''' (1521) took place during the [[Italian War of 1521]].  An [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] army besieged the city (now part of [[Charleville-M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res]]), which was defended by [[France|French]] troops under the command of the [[Chevalier de Bayard]] and [[Anne de Montmorency]]; the siege was unsuccessful, and the determined French resistance gave [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] time to concentrate his forces against [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].

=== Tournai ===
The '''Siege of Tournai''' (1521) took place during the [[Italian War of 1521]].  An [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] army besieged the city of [[Tournai]], capturing it from the [[France|French]] in late November; it would remain a [[Habsburg]] possession until the independence of [[Belgium]].

=== Bicocca ===
{{details|Battle of Bicocca}}

=== Genoa ===
The '''Siege of Genoa''' (May 20, 1522<U+2013>May 30, 1522) was conducted by an army of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] under the command of Spanish General [[Fernando d'Avalos]] and Italian condottiero [[Prospero Colonna (condottiero)|Prospero Colonna]] against the [[France|French]] forces defending the Italian city.  Since [[Genoa]] had refused to surrender, the Imperial troops were permitted to loot the city once it had fallen.

=== Sesia ===
The '''Battle of the Sesia''' (April 30, 1524) was a battle in the [[Italian War of 1521]] fought near the [[Sesia River]] that saw the [[Habsburg]] forces under [[Charles de Lannoy]] inflict a decisive defeat on the [[France|French]] under [[Admiral Bonnivet]] and the [[Fran<U+00E7>ois I, Duc d'Estouteville|comte de St. Pol]], forcing the latter to withdraw from Lombardy.

=== Marseille ===
The '''Siege of Marseille''' (August<U+2013>September 1524) was conducted by an [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] army under [[Charles III, Duke of Bourbon|Charles de Bourbon]] (who had recently betrayed [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]) and [[Fernando de Avalos]] against the [[France|French]] defenders of [[Marseille]].  Although Avalos heavily looted the surrounding countryside, he was unsuccessful in seizing the city; and, faced with the arrival of French reinforcements, called off the siege in September.

=== St. Dizier ===
The '''Siege of St. Dizier''' took place in the summer of [[1544]], during the [[Italian War of 1542]], when the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] army of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] attacked the [[France|French]] city of [[St. Dizier]] at the beginning of its advance into [[Champagne, France|Champagne]].  The siege was already underway when Charles V himself arrived with an army of 14,100 (including 1600 [[sapper|sappers]]) on 13 July. The next day an imperial commander, [[Ren<U+00E9> of Ch<U+00E2>lon]], [[The Prince of Orange|Prince of Orange]], was struck by a shot from the defenders, and died the next day with the Emperor by his bed (his title and lands going to his famous cousin, [[William the Silent]]). On 23 July French outposts near the besieged town were overrun, but a French army under the command of the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] [[Henry II of France|Henry]] maintained an observing position at Jalons. On August 17 the town surrendered. Charles elected not to attack the Dauphin's army and instead pressed on to [[Soissons]].
