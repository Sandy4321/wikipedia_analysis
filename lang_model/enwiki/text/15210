==Overview==
A Nameless Ghoul explained that the songs on ''Opus Eponymous'' were written in 2007 and 2008, around two years before the album.<ref name="Exclaim">{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/WebExclusive/ghost/Page/2 |title=Ghost Interview |publisher=[[Exclaim!]] |accessdate=2013-05-12}}</ref> It was the songs that caused Ghost to become a theatrical band with their Satanic theme, "Very early on, when the material came together in the project phase before it was actually a band, when it was a logo and a couple of songs, it came together by itself because the material and the lyrics sort of screamed a over-the-top commitment to the dark side. It is hard to make that credible and really eerie. What we thought of when we heard the songs is basically a band that looks the way we do now.", explained a Ghoul.<ref name="Exclaim"/> A member said that it was the song "Stand By Him" that heralded the start of the band; "while being together in another band, Ghost started when I played a riff to everybody else. I said that this is probably the most heavy metal riff that has ever existed. Then I showed them the opening riff to <U+201C>Stand By Him.<U+201D> When the chorus came to me, it haunted my dreams. Every time I picked up the guitar, I ended up playing that progression, and when I fit the words in, it seemed to cry out for a Satanically-oriented lyric. This was in 2006. When we came up with the name Ghost, it seemed only natural to build on the foundation of this heavy imagery. Within that concept we were able to combine our love of horror films, and of course, the traditions of Scandinavian metal."<ref name="eMusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.emusic.com/music-news/interview/interview-ghost-b-c/2 |title=Interview: Ghost B.C. |publisher=[[eMusic]] |date=2013-05-08 |accessdate=2013-05-12}}</ref> The songs "Con Clavi Con Dio" and "Genesis" are speed up [[waltz]]es.<ref name="Quietus">{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/12119-ghost-bc-infestissumam-interview-nameless-ghoul |title=Masked Balls And Papal Bull: Ghost B.C. Interviewed |publisher=[[The Quietus]] |date=2013-04-29 |accessdate=2013-05-12}}</ref>

Describing why they covered "Here Comes the Sun", a Ghoul said "I<U+2019>ve been a fan of Beatles even longer than I<U+2019>ve been listening to hard rock, so it made a lot of sense."<ref name="HereComesSun">{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/9107-ghost-bc/ |title=Show No Mercy: Ghost B.C. |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |date=2013-04-12 |accessdate=2013-04-12}}</ref> He explained that the band selects songs to cover based on if they can adapt it into their own; "We sort of found the angle of taking that so and inverting it. And that<U+2019>s something that<U+2019>s sort of the Ghost recipe for doing covers, it has to be a song that has some sort of tongue-in-cheek inversion quality to it. And that song just screamed <U+201C>cover.<U+201D>"<ref name="HereComesSun"/>

The theme of ''Opus Eponymous'' ties in with the band's second album, ''[[Infestissumam]]''; "Everything on the first record was about a coming darkness, an impending doom. Whereas the new record is about something present, and literally, the new record deals with the presence of the Anti-Christ, the Devil."<ref name="HereComesSun"/> The first album ended with "Genesis", the birth of the [[Antichrist]], and ''Infestissumam'' continues from the Antichrist's birth onwards.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bennett |first=J. |title=Receive the Beast |journal=[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]] |volume=100 |year=2013 |month=February |page=80}}</ref>
