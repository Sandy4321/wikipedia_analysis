'''''Mario Artist''''' is a suite of four [[Nintendo 64]] software titles, some of which were bundled with Nintendo's [[64DD]], for the peripheral's launch in Japan in December 1999. Four series titles were released in total, and the rest were canceled.

Development was managed by [[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development|Nintendo EAD]], in conjunction with two other development companies. Some of the suite's titles such as ''Polygon Studio'' were developed by the developer of professional 3D graphics software (having already developed some of Nintendo's own graphics development tools), Nichimen Graphics; and some (originally demonstrated as the singular title ''Creator''<ref name="Creator and Mario Artist">{{cite web | publisher=Zee 3 | title=Career timeline | url=http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/career_timeline.php#nintendo | accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref>) such as ''Paint Studio'' were developed by [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]] of the UK.

''Paint Studio'' has been described as the "direct follow-up"<ref name="Mario Artist: Paint Studio Review at IGN">{{cite web | title=Mario Artist: Paint Studio Review | publisher=IGN | url=http://www.ign.com/games/mario-artist-paint-studio/64dd-1908 | accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref> and "spiritual successor"<ref name="64DD at NWP">{{cite web | title=Nintendo's Expansion Ports: Nintendo 64 Disk Drive | first=Danny | last=Bivens | date=October 29, 2011 | publisher=Nintendo World Report | url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/27670/nintendos-expansion-ports-nintendo-64-disk-drive | accessdate=September 2, 2014}}</ref> to the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]'s ''[[Mario Paint]]'', and IGN calls ''Talent Studio'' the 64DD's "killer app".<ref name="Talent Studio at IGN"/>

'''''Mario Artist: Paint Studio''''', released on December 11, 1999, is a Mario-themed [[paint program]]. The user has a variety of brush sizes, textures, and stamps, with which to paint, draw, spray, sketch, and animate. It has been described as the "direct follow-up"<ref name="Mario Artist: Paint Studio Review at IGN"/> and "spiritual successor"<ref name="64DD at NWP"/> to the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]'s ''[[Mario Paint]]'', and as akin to an Adobe Photoshop for kids.<ref name="Mario Artist: Paint Studio Review at IGN"/>

Originally titled ''Picture Maker'',<ref name="Mario Artist: Paint Studio Review at IGN"/> the software was commissioned by Nintendo from UK game studio [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]]. Starting on June 1, 1995, the original goal was to create what the studio described as "a sequel to Mario Paint in 3D for the N64". Ultimately bundled with the Nintendo 64 Mouse, it is one of the two 64DD launch titles on December 11, 1999.<ref name="Mario Artist at Pickford Bros">{{cite web | title=Mario Artist: Paint Studio / Sound Studio | publisher= Zee-3 Digital Publishing | url=http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/softography/index.php?game=61 | accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref> Utilizing the [[Nintendo 64]] Capture Cartridge, the user can import images and movies from any [[NTSC]] video source such as [[video tape]] or a video camera. The Japanese version of the [[Game Boy Camera]] can be utilized via the [[Nintendo 64 accessories#Transfer Pak | Transfer Pak]]. The studio features a unique four player drawing mode. Minigames include a fly swatting game reminiscent of that in ''Mario Paint'', and a game reminiscent of ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Snap]]''.<ref name="Mario Artist: Paint Studio Review at IGN"/>

===''Talent Studio''===
'''''Mario Artist: Talent Studio''''', released on February 23, 2000, is bundled with the Nintendo 64 Capture Cartridge. Originally titled ''Talent Maker'', it is based upon the Japanese idea of "talent" to present the users as being [[television personality|television personalities]].<ref name="Leaves CD Systems"/>  It is a simple [[animation]] production studio which lets the user insert captured images such as human faces onto [[3-D computer graphics|3D]] models which had been made with ''Polygon Studio'', dress up the models with hundreds of clothes and accessories, and then animate the models with sound, music, and special effects. Players can run an analog video source such as a [[VCR]] or [[camcorder]] through the Capture Cartridge and record movies on the Nintendo 64. A still image, such as a person's face from a video source or Game Boy Camera, may be pasted onto the characters created in ''Polygon Studio'' and placed into movies created with ''Talent Studio''.

IGN describes it as the 64DD's "killer app" with a graphical interface that's "so easy to use that anyone can figure it out after a few minutes", letting the user create "fashion shows, karate demonstrations, characters waiting outside a bathroom stall, and more" featuring their own faces.<ref name="Talent Studio at IGN">{{ cite web | title=Mario Artist: Talent Studio Review | publisher=IGN | url=http://www.ign.com/games/mario-artist-talent-studio/64dd-10085 | accessdate=September 5, 2014}}</ref>  The concept of a personal avatar creator app as is seen in today's [[Mii]], is seen in ''Mario Artist: Talent Studio''.

===''Communication Kit''===
'''''Mario Artist: Communication Kit''''', released on June 29, 2000,<ref>[http://www.gamefaqs.com/n64dd/916661-mario-artist-communication-kit/data Communication Kit release data], GameFAQs.</ref> allowed users to connect to the now-defunct [[Randnet]]'s "Net Studio".  There, it was possible to share creations made with ''Paint Studio'', ''Talent Studio'', or ''Polygon Studio'', with other Randnet members. Other features included contests and 3D papercraft [[printing]] services available by online mail order. The Randnet network service started in December, 1999, and was discontinued on February 28, 2001.

The disk has content that may be unlocked and used in ''Paint Studio''.

===''Polygon Studio''===
'''''Mario Artist: Polygon Studio''''', released on August 29, 1999,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://64dd.net/modules/games/?system=64dd&type=released&section=main&id=7 |title=64DD.net &#124; Games - 64DD - Released - Mario Artist: Polygon Studio &#124; |publisher=64DD |date=1999-08-29 |accessdate=2014-02-25}}</ref> is a [[3D computer graphics]] editor that lets the user design and render 3D polygon images with a simple level of detail.  In development, it was originally named ''Polygon Maker'' until an announcement at [[Nintendo Space World]] '99.  Supported peripherals are the Expansion Pak and the Nintendo 64 Mouse.

The idea of [[minigame]]s was popularized generally during the Nintendo 64's [[fifth generation video game consoles|fifth generation of video game consoles]] and some early minigames appear in ''Polygon Studio'' in the style that would later be used in the [[WarioWare (series)|WarioWare]] series of games.  Certain minigames literally originated in ''Mario Artist: Polygon Studio'', as explained by Goro Abe of [[Nintendo Research & Development 1|Nintendo R&D1]]'s so-called Wario Ware All-Star Team:

{{quote box | quote=In Polygon Studio you could create 3D models and animate them in the game, but there was also a side game included inside. In this game you would have to play short games that came one after another. This is where the idea for Wario Ware came from.<ref name="Nintendo RD1 Interview">{{ cite interview | publisher=Video Games Daily | title=Nintendo R&D1 Interview | url=http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/features/ncl_nintendo_wwiv_apr06_p1.asp | date=April 7, 2006 | first1=Yoshio | last1=Sakamoto | first2=Ryuichi | last2=Nakada | first3=Ko | last3=Takeuchi | first4=Goro | last4=Abe | first5=Taku | last5=Sugioka | first6=Naoko | last6=Mori | accessdate=June 14, 2014}}</ref>{{rp|p.2}}<ref name="Virtually Overlooked: Mario Artist">{{ cite web | title=Virtually Overlooked: Mario Artist | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/08/28/virtually-overlooked-mario-artist/ | date=Aug 28, 2008 | first=JC | last=Fletcher | accessdate=June 14, 2014}}</ref>}}

The premise of [[3D printing]] was roughly implemented as [[papercraft]], by way of modeling the characters in ''Polygon Studio'' and then utilizing ''Communication Kit'' to upload the data to Randnet's online printing service.  The user then cuts, folds, and pastes the resulting colored paper into a fully-figured 3D figure.<ref name="Polygon Studio at 64DD.net">{{cite web | title=Mario Artist: Polygon Studio | url=http://64dd.net/modules/games/?system=64dd&type=released&section=main&id=7 | accessdate=June 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Virtually Overlooked: Mario Artist"/>

==Reception==
Nintendo World Report described the ''Mario Artist'' series as a "spiritual successor to ''Mario Paint''".<ref name="64DD at NWP"/>  IGN collectively describes the ''Mario Artist'' suite as a layperson's analog to professional quality graphics development software. They state that the combination of the 64DD's mass writability and the Nintendo 64's 3D graphics allows Nintendo to "leave CD systems behind", by offering "something that couldn't be done on any other gaming console on the market" to people "who want to unleash their creative talents and perhaps learn a little bit about graphics design on the side".<ref name="Leaves CD Systems">{{cite web | title=Mario Artist Series Leaves CD Systems Behind | date=November 21, 1997 | publisher=IGN | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1997/11/22/mario-artist-series-leaves-cd-systems-behind | accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref>

Rating it at 8.2 ("Great") out of 10, IGN calls ''Talent Studio'' the 64DD's "killer app" with a graphical interface that's "so easy to use that anyone can figure it out after a few minutes".<ref name="Talent Studio at IGN"/>

IGN rates ''Paint Studio'' at 7.0 ("Good") out of 10, describing it as being like an Adobe Photoshop for kids.<ref name="Mario Artist: Paint Studio Review at IGN"/>

===Legacy===

''Polygon Studio'' contains some mini games, which appear in ''[[WarioWare (series)|WarioWare]]'' games of future console generations.  The premise of [[3D printing]] is seen in ''Polygon Studio''. The idea of graphical stamps that are seen in various [[Miiverse]]-supported games is found in ''Mario Artist: Paint Studio''.
