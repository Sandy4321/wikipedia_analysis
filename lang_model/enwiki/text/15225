All had their throats slit from ear to ear, with such great force that they were nearly [[decapitation|decapitated]]. Thousands of dollars of marijuana and money were left covering their mutilated bodies, and $5,000 was left at the scene. The local district attorney said that it appeared that the killer and the victims knew each other, and that the murders were not random.

[[Tamerlan Tsarnaev]], the deceased suspect in the 2013 [[Boston Marathon bombings]], had previously described murder victim Brendan Mess as his best friend, though before Mess was murdered there had been animosity between Tsarnaev and Mess over Mess' "lifestyle". After the bombings and subsequent revelations of Tsarnaev's personal life, the Waltham murders case was reexamined in April 2013 with Tsarnaev as a new suspect.<ref name=probe/> [[American Broadcasting Company |ABC]] reported that authorities believe Tsarnaev and his younger brother may have been responsible for the triple homicide, that forensic evidence connected them to the scene of the killings, and that their cell phone records placed them in the area.<ref name="tabletmag1"/> While police in the first investigation said that victims were killed on September 12, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[Boston Herald]]'', and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that at least one relative of the victims believe that the killings took place on September 11.<ref name=probe/><ref>{{cite web|first=Peter|last=Hermann|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/authorities-investigating-slain-boston-bombing-suspect-in-three-earlier-killings/2013/04/22/5a5c6874-ab91-11e2-a8b9-2a63d75b5459_story.html |title=Authorities investigating slain Boston bombing suspect in three earlier killings|publisher=The Washington Post|date=January 17, 2013|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref>

In May 2013, [[Ibragim Todashev]], a 27-year-old Chechen native and former mixed martial arts fighter who knew Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was shot and killed in [[Orlando, Florida]], by law enforcement officers who had been interviewing him about the Waltham murders. The FBI has alleged that just before he was killed, Todashev made statements implicating both himself and Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the Waltham murders, and that the initial crime was a drug [[robbery]], and the murders were an attempt to mask the identity of the robbers.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/us/officer-involved-in-shooting-of-man-tied-to-tsarnaev.html</ref>

==2013 investigation developments==

===New investigation details===
''[[The Boston Globe]]'' first made the connection to the murders.<ref name="forward2"/>

On April 22, 2013, the [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]] District Attorney's Office stated that it was actively investigating the possible connection of [[Boston Marathon bombings]] suspect [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev]] to the murders.<ref name="foxnews1">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/04/22/da-looks-for-links-between-bomb-suspect-tamerlan-tsarnaev-and-2011-triple/ |first=Cristina|last=Corbin |title=DA looks for links between bomb suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and 2011 triple murder |publisher=Fox News |date=April 22, 2013 |accessdate=April 23, 2013}}</ref> ABC reported that authorities believe Tsarnaev may have been responsible for the triple homicide.<ref name="tabletmag1"/> The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] joined the investigation, and expects to conduct a lengthy investigation to examine whether the Tsarnaev brothers were involved in the murders.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gordon|first=Greg|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2020845405_bostonsuspectwarsxml.html|title=Accused bomber says U.S. wars fed the brothers<U+2019> radicalism|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=April 23, 2013|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref>

Investigators on the Boston Marathon bombings case have said Tamerlan Tsarnaev visited Dagestan and neighboring Chechnya for six months following the date of the Waltham murders.<ref name="probe"/> At the time of the killings, Tsarnaev, then 24, was beginning to be influenced by radical Islam and becoming increasingly strict in his interpretation of Islam.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sherwell|first=Philip|title=Boston bombs: Prosecutors investigating Tamerlan Tsarnaev link to 2011 murders|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10011414/Boston-bombs-Prosecutors-investigating-Tamerlan-Tsarnaev-link-to-2011-murders.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=Apr 22, 2013}}</ref> They are seeking to determine whether the killings may have been timed to take place on the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.<ref name="forward1">{{cite news|url=http://forward.com/articles/175285/police-probe---anniversary-link-in-jewish-murde|title=Police Probe 9/11 Anniversary Link in Jewish Murders Tied to Boston Bomber; Did Tamerlan Tsarnaev Kill Decade to Day After Attacks?|publisher=Forward|date=April 23, 2013|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref>

After the Marathon bombing, a [[Planet Aid]] driver found discarded fireworks in the Planet Aid donation bin in the parking lot of a restaurant, Gerry's Italian Kitchen, that has been connected in other ways to the Waltham murders case and to the Tsarnaev brothers.<ref name=abcnews3/> Police investigators told ABC News that "the gunpowder had been emptied from the fireworks and the shells discarded in a shopping bag inside the bin."<ref name=abcnews3/>

===Tamerlan Tsarnaev's connection to the victims===
[[File:BostonSuspect1.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Tamerlan Tsarnaev]], who authorities believe may have been responsible for the triple homicide]]

Both men were boxers, and they were sparring partners spent hours training and sparring together beginning in 2009.<ref name="abcnews2"/>  In 2011 Tamerlan had introduced Mess to John Allan, owner of Wai Kru Mixed Martial Arts in Allston, describing him as his "best friend".<ref name=probe/>  

Allan said: <blockquote>After Mess died it really shocked me how unemotional [Tamerlan] was. He just kind of laughed and said, <U+2018>Can you believe it?<U+2019> It was like he didn<U+2019>t care about this kid he grew up with.</blockquote>  Tsarnaev stopped going to the martial arts center after Mess was murdered, and had not been back in years until March 2013 when he suddenly visited and acted rudely.<ref name="foxnews1"/>
<nowiki></nowiki>
The website [[BuzzFeed]] interviewed a friend of Mess named Ray, who also knew Tsarnaev and who was in the same social circle in Cambridge.<ref name="nydailynews1">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/tamerlan-tsarnaev-questioned-sinister-link-withs-involvement-triple-homicide-article-1.1324160 |first=Erik|last=Ortiz|title=A sinister link?

He said: <blockquote>Tam wasn't there at the memorial service, he wasn't at the funeral, he wasn't around at all... And he was really close with Brendan. That's why it's so weird when he said, 'I don't have any American friends.'<ref name="forward2"/></blockquote> Ray continued: "He was somebody who was in contact with Brendan on a daily basis. Anybody like that you would think they would have been around."<ref name="nydailynews1"/>  Ray did not have any further contact with Tsarnaev after the murders.<ref>{{cite news|last=Miller |first=Elhanan |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/friends-wonder-if-boston-suspect-was-linked-to-2011-murders/ |author= |title=Friends wonder if Boston suspect was linked to 2011 murders |publisher=The Times of Israel |date= April 22, 2013|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}</ref>

One of Mess' relatives also told investigators they thought it was odd that Tsarnaev had not attended his friend Mess' funeral.  Nor was he at his memorial service.<ref name="autogenerated3"/>  Two law enforcement sources said that the Mess relative also noted that there had been animosity between Tsarnaev and Mess, over Mess' "lifestyle".<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/boston-bomb-suspect-eyed-connection-2011-triple-murder/story?id=19015628&page=2#.UXYYN1fhf5k |title=Page 2: Boston Bomb Suspect Eyed in Connection to 2011 Triple Murder |publisher=ABC News |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2013}}</ref>

On May 10, 2013 investigators in Massachusetts were reported to have developed what they called "mounting evidence" supported by "forensic hits" as some [[crime scene]] [[forensic evidence]] provided a match to the two Tsarnaev brothers, pointing to the possible involvement of both  Tsarnaev brothers in the killings.<ref name=abcnews3/> Further definitive [[DNA]] testing must be completed before an [[indictment]] against the surviving brother can be considered, according to the officials.<ref name=abcnews3/> Their cell phone records also appeared to put the Tsarnaev brothers in the area of the murders on that date, according to the officials.<ref name=abcnews3/>

===Ibragim Todashev interview and death===
{{main|Ibragim Todashev}}

On May 22, 2013, law enforcement officers, including an FBI [[special agent]] from the [[List of FBI field offices#Massachusetts|Boston field office]], and two [[Massachusetts State Police]] troopers, interviewed a Chechen immigrant named Ibragim Todashev for approximately eight hours at his apartment in [[Orlando, Florida]], regarding the Waltham triple murder and his connections to Tamerlan Tsarnaev and other extremists.<ref name="NYT0513"/><ref name="bostonglobe">{{Cite journal |title=Slain suspect had thought about missing FBI interview |first=Wesley|last=Lowery, David Filipov and Mark Arsenault |date=May 23, 2013 |journal=Boston Globe |url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/05/23/father-man-killed-fbi-agents-orlando-fla-says-his-son-was-not-capable-attacking-police/hAWCiZoteCnjT7OysmoH9L/story.html }}</ref> They said that he implicated both himself and Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the murders during the questioning and was beginning to write a formal statement when he asked to take a break and then suddenly attacked the FBI agent.<ref name="NYT0513"/><ref name="bostonglobe" /> Todashev was shot multiple times and killed by the officers.<ref name="bostonglobe" /><ref name=ABCNews20130529/><ref name=Atlantic20130530/>

===The date and time of the murders===
Questioning the Sept. 12 date initially reported by officials, a relative said: "The three of them were definitely killed on Sept. 11.... They all stopped using their cellphones at about eight o'clock that night."<ref name="probe"/>  

The last time anyone is known to have heard from the three victims was at 8:54 p.m. on September 11, 2011, when a call was placed by someone using Weissman's cell phone to Gerry's Italian Kitchen, a Watertown restaurant, for delivery of three dinner entrees.<ref name="abcnews2"/> When a delivery woman arrived at 9:14 p.m. there was no answer at the door, and no one answered when the restaurant called Weissman's cell phone.<ref name="abcnews2"/>

Police now believe the killings took place on the evening of September 11, the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, based on text messages.<ref name="abcnews2"/>

==Media coverage==

For about a week after the murders the crime received extensive media attention across the region, but without further updates from police, media reports dried up.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ostrowsky |first=Jon |url=http://thebrandeishoot.com/articles/11123 |title=Waltham authorities helpless in Sept murder investigation |publisher=The Brandeis Hoot |date=November 4, 2011 |accessdate=April 23, 2013}}</ref> One year later, in September 2012, regional media again reported on the unsolved murders. In April 2013, when a possible connection to a Boston Marathon bombings suspect was made, the murders received extensive worldwide media coverage.
