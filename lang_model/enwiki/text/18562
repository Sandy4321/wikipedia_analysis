'''Route 155''' was a short state highway in the community of [[Palmyra, New Jersey]] in [[Burlington County, New Jersey|Burlington County]]. The route ran from the ferry docks to the north of the [[Tacony&ndash;Palmyra Bridge]] ([[New Jersey Route 73]]) through the community, terminating at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 130]]. The highway was a former alignment of NJ 73 before the construction of the bridge. The route originated as '''Route S41N''' in the 1927 renumbering. The route was decommissioned and turned over to Burlington County, who designated it as an extension of County Route 607.
