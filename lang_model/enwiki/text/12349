'''Ryan David Leaf''' (born [[May 15]], [[1976]]) is a former [[American football]] [[quarterback]] who played for the [[San Diego Chargers]], [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Seattle Seahawks]] between [[1998 NFL season|1998]] and [[2002 NFL season|2002]]. As of 2007, he is quarterback coach and golf head coach for [[West Texas A&M University]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Leaf to Direct West Texas A&M Men's Golf During Upcoming Spring Semester |url= http://gobuffsgo.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/spec-rel/121806aaa.html|work= This is Buffalo Country|publisher=West Texas A&M University athletics|date= [[2006-12-18]]|accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref> His brother, Brady Leaf, is currently a quarterback for the [[University of Oregon]] [[Oregon Ducks|Ducks]].<ref name="Brady">{{cite news |first= Ed|last=Graney |title=Different sort of Leaf at Qualcomm |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/graney/20051226-9999-1s26graney2.html |publisher=San Diego Union-Tribune |date= [[2005-12-26]] |accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref>

Leaf had a successful college career at [[Washington State University]], where he was a finalist for the [[Heisman Trophy]] his junior year. He was selected as the second overall pick in the [[1998 NFL Draft]], after which many scouts predicted that Leaf would have a successful career in the league.<ref name="Successful">{{cite news |first= Cheney|last= Wash|title=Leaf retires rather than reporting to Seahawks' camp |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2002/0726/1410477.html |publisher=ESPN |date= [[2002-07-27]] |accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref> However, despite his athleticism, his time as a professional was short and marked by injuries and failure.

==College career==
Leaf was born in [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]], [[Montana]], and led [[C. M. Russell High School]] to the 1992 Montana state title.<ref name="statetitle">{{cite news |title= Sports Illustrated 50 Greatest Montana Sports Figures|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/magazine/features/si50/states/montana/greatest/ |publisher=Sports Illustrated |date= [[1999-12-22]] |accessdate=2007-02-23 }}</ref> After high school, Leaf played [[college football]] at [[Washington State University]], playing in 32 games for the [[Washington State Cougars|Cougars]] and [[Starting lineup|starting]] 24 of them. He averaged 330.6 yards passing per game in his junior year and threw for a then-[[Pacific Ten Conference|Pac-10]] conference record 33 [[touchdown]]s. He also helped the Cougars defeat the [[University of Washington]] [[Washington Huskies football|Huskies]], 41-35, for the first time since 1994. Leaf ended the school's 67-year [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] drought and helped bring the Cougars their first Pac-10 championship in school history. Despite a strong early showing by Leaf in the Rose Bowl, the Cougars were defeated 21-16 by eventual co-national champion [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] [[Michigan Wolverines football|Wolverines]].<ref name="clock">{{cite news |title=National title voting seems just a formality |url=http://www.cincypost.com/sports/1998/rose010298.html |publisher=The Cincinnati Post |date= [[1998-01-02]] |accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref> 

That year, Leaf was a finalist in balloting for the Heisman Trophy, given annually to the "most outstanding" player in American college football, as voted by media figures and former players. He finished third in the voting, behind winner [[Charles Woodson]] of Michigan and fellow quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] of [[University of Tennessee|Tennessee]]. He was also selected as the Pac-10 offensive player of the year, was a first-team [[All-America]]n, and had the second-best national [[passer rating]].<ref name="Pac-10">{{cite news |first=Washington |last=Pullman |title= Where will Leaf fall?

==1998 draft==
When they entered the 1998 draft, Manning and Leaf were widely considered to be the two best overall players in the draft.<ref name="Pac-10"/> The San Diego Chargers held the third pick of the draft, but made a trade with the [[Arizona Cardinals]] to guarantee their team would get one of the two quarterbacks. To move up to the second pick in the draft, the Chargers traded two first-round picks, a second-round pick, and four-time [[Pro Bowl]]er [[Eric Metcalf]].<ref name="Metcalf">{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/news/2001/02/28/sayitaintso_chargers/ |title=Chargers| year=2001 |accessdate=2007-02-11 |publisher=Sports Illustrated |work= Say It Ain't So... Transactions that broke our hearts}}</ref>

There was some debate leading up to the draft as to whether Leaf or Manning should be selected first.<ref name="Coach">{{cite news |title=Leaf has footwork to move from QB to coach |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2554770 |publisher= ESPN|date= [[2006-08-19]] |accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref> Leaf was agreed to have a stronger arm, but most analysts agreed that Manning was the more mature player and the consensus top choice. However, differences in potential between the two seemed small enough that most observers expected it would not greatly matter whether a team selected Manning or Leaf.<ref name="Pac-10"/><ref name="Sherrington">{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Sherrington |title= Leaf gets a career mulligan|url= http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/columnists/ksherrington/stories/020407dnsposherringotn.1caac91.html |publisher= [[Dallas Morning News]] online|date= [[2007-02-03]]|accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref><ref name="Finney">{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Finney |title=QB debate reminder of choice made in 1998 |url=http://www.nola.com/sports/t-p/index.ssf?/base/sports-29/117264702668750.xml&coll=1 |publisher=[[New Orleans Times-Picayune]] |date=[[2007-02-28]] |accessdate=2007-03-11 }}</ref> 

On draft day, Manning was selected first by the [[Indianapolis Colts]]; Leaf was selected second by the Chargers. Since that time, Manning has won a [[Super Bowl]], set the single-season touchdown pass record, and become a potential [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] for the Colts, while Leaf's short career was spoiled by poor play and off-field incidents. Other quarterbacks in that year's draft included current NFL quarterbacks [[Brian Griese]] and [[Matt Hasselbeck]]. Following the draft, the Chargers signed Leaf to a four-year contract worth [[United States dollar|$]]31.25 million, including a guaranteed $11.25 million [[signing bonus]]. It was, at the time, the largest signing bonus ever paid to a [[rookie]].<ref name="Signingbonus">{{cite news |title= Leaf to Sign for Huge Bonus|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E0DB1E39F935A15754C0A96E958260 |publisher=New York Times |date= [[1998-07-26]] |accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref>  Shortly after being drafted, Leaf delcared, "I'm looking forward to a 15 year career, a couple of trips to the [[Super Bowl]], and a parade through downtown [[San Diego]]."

==NFL career==
===San Diego Chargers===
San Diego's high hopes for Leaf soon were dashed, as his [[1998 NFL season|rookie season]] was marked by poor performances. Before the season started, Leaf was fined for skipping a [[symposium]] that was mandatory for all newly-drafted players.<ref name="symposium">{{cite news |first= Tom|last=Shanahan |title= Rookies prepare for life in NFL|url= http://www.chargers.com/news/headlines/news-1088146800.htm |publisher= chargers.com|date= [[2004-06-25]] |accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref> Leaf did well in the [[preseason]] and won his first two games as a rookie, becoming the first quarterback to do so since [[John Elway]] in the [[1983 NFL season|1983 season]].<ref name="Elway">{{cite news |first=Greg |last=Garber |title=Leaf will leave, but where will he go? |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/columns/garber_greg/880202.html|publisher=ESPN |date= [[2000-11-17]] |accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref> 

But in the third game of the season, Leaf completed one of fifteen passes for 4 yards and [[fumble]]d three times in a loss against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].<ref name="fouryards">{{cite news |first= Bernie|last=Wilson |title=Leaf: It Can't Get Much Worse Than 1-of-15 |url=http://www.laprensa-sandiego.org/archieve/september25/leaf.htm |publisher=La Prensa San Diego |date= [[1998-09-25]] |accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref> He was benched after throwing two touchdown passes and thirteen [[interception]]s in nine games, and replaced by quarterback [[Craig Whelihan]].<ref name="Whelihan">{{cite news |first= Bernie|last=Wilson |title=QB Turning Over A New Leaf? |url=http://www.laprensa-sandiego.org/archieve/november20/leaf.htm |publisher=La Prensa San Diego |date= [[1998-11-20]] |accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref> After ten games, Leaf had thrown two more interceptions, passing for a total of 1,289 yards, with a 45.3 percent completion rate and a paltry [[quarterback rating]] of 39.<ref name="statstwo">{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Cannizzaro|title= Surprise!

Leaf had poor relationships with the [[Mass media|media]] and his teammates, whom he tended to blame for his poor play.<ref name="Successful" /> In one locker room incident during Leaf's rookie year, he was caught on camera screaming at a reporter "Don't fucking talk to me all right! Knock it off!" and had to be physically restrained by teammate [[Junior Seau]]. Another on-camera incident involved Leaf confronting a [[heckle|heckling]] Chargers fan during a practice session.<ref name="Coach" /> Two coaches had to restrain Leaf and escort him off the field. His relationship with then-Chargers safety [[Rodney Harrison]] was notoriously acrimonious, and Harrison described being a member of the Chargers during Leaf's rookie season as "a nightmare you can't even imagine".{{Fact|date=February 2007}}<!--I found 2 different refs: http://web.archive.org/web/20050301164436/http://www.footballproject.com/2001/00000021.html and http://www.footballoutsiders.com/2006/12/15/ramblings/too-deep-zone/4687/, but they contradict each others--> After hearing news of Leaf's retirement in 2002, Harrison was quoted as saying "He probably did the best thing; he took his money and ran."{{Fact|date=February 2007}}<!--There are several versions of the quote, and the source actually only has the second part.--><ref name="Harrison">{{cite news |first=Trent |last=Modglin|title=Ryan Leaf fittingly pulled the plug on one of the most disappointing careers in NFL history |url=http://www.profootballweekly.com/PFW/Commentary/Columns/2002/modglin080202.htm |publisher=Pro Football Weekly |date= [[2002-08-02]] |accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref>

Leaf missed his entire second season due to a shoulder injury uncovered by a preseason physical.<ref name="Elway" /> He was placed on [[injured reserve]] but made headlines for getting into a heated shouting match with Chargers general manager [[Bobby Beathard]] and another coach. The incident resulted in a fine, a suspension without pay, and Leaf apologizing four weeks later.<ref name="Argument">{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Neely |title= Saving Project Ryan: Chargers must take one more shot at salvaging Leaf<U+2019>s career|url=http://archive.profootballweekly.com/content/archives/features_1999/neely_112299.asp |publisher=Pro Football Weekly |date= [[1999-11-22]] |accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref><ref name="Apologized">{{cite news |title=Fallen Leaf returns, says he's sorry |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/1999/1129/202691.html |publisher=ESPN |date= [[1999-12-03]] |accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref>Leaf also allegedly lied about a hand injury to get out of practice so he could play golf instead.<ref name="Harrison"/> 

Leaf started the first two games of the [[2000 NFL season|2000 season]], only to complete less than half of his pass attempts, and throw for five interceptions and one touchdown. When backup [[Moses Moreno]] went down with a strained knee ligament, the Chargers gave Leaf more playing time. However, he injured his wrist while throwing an interception in a week four game and did not play again until week eleven.<ref name="Elway" /> Following more poor performances and injury problems, he was released by the Chargers after the season, with a record of only four wins as a starter in three years.<ref name="fourwins">{{cite news |title=Leaf fails physical, doesn't join Dallas |url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2001/09/06/Sports/Leaf-Fails.Physical.Doesnt.Join.Dallas-492260.shtml |publisher= The Daily Texan online|date= [[2001-09-01]]|accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref>

===Subsequent career and retirement===
After being released by San Diego, Leaf was claimed by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], who were intrigued by his physical talent and planned to develop his abilities more slowly by having him watch and learn.<ref name="buccaneers">{{cite news |title=Buccaneers pick up Leaf |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/03/02/leaf010302.html |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |date= [[2001-03-02]] |accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref> However, Leaf's wrist still had not healed, and he refused to have surgery despite doctors' strong recommendations. After mediocre performances in the Buccaneers' four preseason games, the club asked Leaf to accept a lower salary. He refused, and the club released him just five days before the start of the [[2001 NFL season|2001 season]].<ref name="releasedbucs">{{cite news |first=Rick |last=Stroud |url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/090401/Sports/The_Leaf_experiment_e.shtml |title=The Leaf experiment ends |publisher=St. Petersburg Times |date= [[2001-09-04]] |accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref> 

Leaf attempted a comeback with the [[Dallas Cowboys]], who signed him a few weeks after the Buccaneers released him.

However, Leaf retired at the age of 26, just prior to the start of the Seahawks' [[2002 NFL season|2002]] training camp, initially offering no explanation, but later citing his injuries<ref name="Successful" />.

During his brief career in the NFL, Leaf appeared in 25 games and made 21 starts. He completed 315 of 655 passes for 3,666 yards, with 14 touchdowns and 36 interceptions. Leaf's career quarterback rating was 50.0, much lower than the 78.9 league average between 2000 and 2003.<ref name="quarterbackrating">{{cite news |title=Ryan Leaf: Feeble mind earns Hall of Feeble |url=http://www.footballology.com/hof/article.php3?ArticleID=112 |publisher=Footballology.Com |date= [[2002-08-26]] |accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref>

Leaf is considered one of the biggest disappointments in sports history.

Leaf joined [[Don Carthel]]'s [[West Texas A&M University|West Texas A&M]] staff as a quarterback's coach in 2006, and will be the school's golf coach as of 2007. Said Leaf: "I feel very honored to be a part of Coach Carthel's staff and a part of an up-and-coming successful program. [...] About a year after I retired from playing, I decided that I wanted to get back to college, where I had the greatest time of my life, and to get involved with college football."<ref name="CCoach">{{cite news |first=Phil |last=Richards |title=Humbled by past, Leaf starts anew |url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060428/SPORTS0303/604280521 |publisher= Indianapolis Star|date= [[2006-04-28]] |accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref>  Leaf also admitted that he was unprepared for the NFL when he was drafted back in 1998.<ref name="CCoach" />

Leaf also said in an interview on ESPN on the weekend of Super Bowl XLI that he is not angry that Peyton Manning is having success and the two were actually good friends that he gave him a call recently to congratulate his friend. Leaf also said he would be watching the Super Bowl on televison and rooting for the Colts. Leaf said he enjoys being part of the program and being part of people's lives and he said his antics as a football player are behind him.
