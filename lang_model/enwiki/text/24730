'''Ivica Ra<U+010D>an''' (February 24, 1944 <U+2013> April 29, 2007) was a [[Croatia]]n [[leftist]] politician who led the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]] between 1989, through two name changes, up to 2007, a few weeks before his death. He was also the last leader and democratic transformer of the [[League of Communists of Croatia]].

He was the [[Prime Minister of Croatia]] from 2000 to 2003, when he led a coalition centre-left government, in two consecutive terms.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Ebersbach, Saxony|Ebersbach]], in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], where his mother was interned in a labor camp. He and his mother survived the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[bombing of Dresden]] in which they were buried for days in the basement of a collapsed building.

==Political career==
===1972-1989: Early political career===
During [[Croatia in the second Yugoslavia|socialist Yugoslavia]], Ra<U+010D>an entered politics in 1972 and became a member of the [[League of Communists of Croatia]]. In the 1970s he slowly rose in its positions inside the Party, following the removal from the leading positions of reformists after collapse of the [[Croatian Spring]]. By the end of the 1980s he emerged as one of the Party's leaders. He became its leader in 1989.

Ra<U+010D>an led the Croatian delegation in the XIV. Congress of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] which was held at the end of January 1990. The congress was dominated by [[Slobodan Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]]'s supporters and Slovenian and Croatian delegations were continually voted down. Finally the Slovenian delegation declared they were leaving the party. Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> tried to persuade Ra<U+010D>an to stay, but Ra<U+010D>an replied that a Communist Party without the Slovenes was not acceptable. Without the Croatian delegation it was impossible to reconvene the congress. ''(Adam Le Bor: Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>)'' 

Ra<U+010D>an broke other taboos of socialist Yugoslavia, too: he was the first president of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Croatia who publicly congratulated believers in Croatia at [[Christmas]] in 1989, and he organized the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|multiparty elections]] a few months later.

===1990-1999: In opposition===
Following the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|multi-party elections]], he became the leader of the reformed League of Communists of Croatia (which added ''Party of Democratic Changes'' to its name). During the campaign for [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|multi-party elections]] of 1990 Ra<U+010D>an created a storm of controversy when he referred to the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (''Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica'', [[HDZ]]), the eventual winner of the elections, as a "political party with dangerous intentions".

His Party lost the election, but remained the second largest party in new Parliament, and Ra<U+010D>an was supposed to continue his political career, this time the first leader of opposition in history of modern Croatia. SKH however, quickly became the shadow of its former self - the majority of its membership, including the highest ranking officials, defected to HDZ, while the collapse of Yugoslavia, ethnic Serb rebellion and war further radicalized Croatian public. In such circumstances, Ra<U+010D>an was more concerned with the mere survival of his Party than with challenging [[Franjo Tu<U+0111>man]]'s rule, even if it meant tolerating some of Tu<U+0111>man's more controversial policies, like nationalization of worker's owned enterprises, privatization or various human rights abuses. 

In such circumstances, when his party used to be ironically called "HDZ Little Sister", Ra<U+010D>an gave up the opposition leader's title to [[Dra<U+017E>en Budi<U+0161>a]] of [[Croatian Social Liberal Party]] (HSLS). SDP barely managed to pass the threshold in [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1992|1992 parliamentary elections]], but it established itself as a social democratic option.

In 1994, SDP incorporated the [[Social Democrats of Croatia]], got renamed to its current title [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]], and became an alternative to Tu<U+0111>man.

Following the end of the war, Croatian voters were becoming more concerned with social issues, and in such circumstances SDP gradually began to consolidate support at the expense of other opposition parties, most notably the social liberals, HSLS. This became evident at [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1995|1995 parliamentary]] and [[Croatian presidential election, 1997|1997 presidential elections]].

===2000-2003: Return to power===

In 1998 Ra<U+010D>an and Budi<U+0161>a created an alliance that would win [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2000|parliamentary elections]] two years later.

Following the election, Ra<U+010D>an became the [[Prime ministers of Croatia|prime minister]] of Croatia with the help of HSLS, and the centrist bloc which comprises [[Croatian Peasants Party]] (HSS), the [[Liberal Party (Croatia)|Liberal Party]] (LS), [[Croatian People's Party]] (HNS), [[Istrian Democratic Congress]] (IDS). All of those six parties had ministers within Ra<U+010D>an's cabinet.

Ra<U+010D>an, like the newly elected president [[Stjepan Mesi<U+0107>]], was initially hailed as a new, reformist leader who would symbolize the break with Croatia's authoritarian and nationalist past. While a democrat, Ra<U+010D>an was, however, inefficient in running a government comprising six parties, the first coalition in modern Croatian history. His style of governance, symbolized by the phrase "Odlu<U+010D>no mo<U+017E>da" ("Decisive perhaps" in English), plagued his government with factional struggles. Ra<U+010D>an had to adopt a compromise-making attitude which limited the government's ability to commit fully to what should be done.

This led to the break-up with Budi<U+0161>a who took a more nationalist approach in dealing with the issues of [[ICTY]] indictments against Croatian Army generals. This rift began to affect Ra<U+010D>an's government in other issues. IDS was the first to leave the coalition.

Ra<U+010D>an briefly resigned on [[July 5]], [[2002]] after their coalition partner HSLS obstructed the ratification of a vital agreement with [[Slovenia]] on the status of the co-owned [[Kr<U+0161>ko Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear plant in Kr<U+0161>ko]]. The HSLS later split into the main faction that left the government and a dissenting faction that formed a new party called [[Party of Liberal Democrats (Croatia)|Libra]] which enabled Ra<U+010D>an to form a slightly modified government that would remain in power until the next elections.

Ra<U+010D>an's best achievements were in foreign policy. He successfully brought Croatia out of the semi-isolation of the Tu<U+0111>man era and set the country on the road towards membership of the [[European Union]]. During his term as prime minister, the [[Constitution of Croatia]] was amended, turning Croatia from a semi-[[presidential system]] to a [[parliamentary democracy]] and granting more power to the institutions of the [[Sabor]] (parliament) and [[prime minister]]. Among other things, Ra<U+010D>an opened the government's workings to the people with "''open-doors day''" at the government and regular press conferences, in sharp contrast to previous governments who mostly shunned media attention.

During his term in office, Croatia also changed economically. The opening to the West brought fresh inflows of capital which helped jump-start Croatia's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth, which held at about 5% during the years of the Ra<U+010D>an government - high compared to previous years. The government also undertook a wave of reforms in the public and government sectors and started large building projects, such as affordable housing and the [[Zagreb]]-[[Split (city)|Split]] highway, long-desired due to importance in [[tourism]].

During this period, Ra<U+010D>an also began to heal the rifts between Croatia and its neighbour [[Serbia]] (still with its final federation) and other former Yugoslav republics.

===2003-2006: Back to opposition===
His center-left coalition lost the parliamentary majority with the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2003|elections]] of November 2003. Ra<U+010D>an conceded the defeat soon after the results were published. He officially ceased to be the prime minister on [[December 23]], [[2003]] when the [[Croatian Parliament]] gave its consent for his successor, [[Ivo Sanader]] of the [[Croatian Democratic Union]].

SDP remained the most popular opposition party in opinion polls, and Ivica Ra<U+010D>an was, until recently, viewed as the leader of Croatian opposition.

While viewed indecisive as prime minister, he proved to be very skillful in his party maintaining the leadership position for fifteen years. In 2006, Ra<U+010D>an publicly stated that this was his last term as the party president.

==Private life==

Ivica Ra<U+010D>an was married three times and had two sons from his first marriage. His first wife [[Agata Ra<U+010D>an]] is a judge in the [[Croatian Constitutional Court]] and his third wife [[Dijana Ple<U+0161>tina]] is a professor of political science at the [[College of Wooster]].

Ra<U+010D>an was well known as a career politician, as he worked only in politics from 1972.

==Illness and death==
On [[January 31]], [[2007]], Ivica Ra<U+010D>an announced that he was temporarily leaving public life due to health reasons. Vice-president [[<U+017D>eljka Antunovi<U+0107>]] took the chairmanship of the Party. His health began to worsen and after examinations, it was found that he had [[cancer]] in his shoulder, then in his urinary tract, and finally that it had spread to his brain.<ref>[http://www.makfax.com.mk/look/novina/article.tpl?IdLanguage=1&IdPublication=2&NrArticle=62099&NrIssue=314&NrSection=20  Ivica Racan's health condition worsens]</ref> On [[April 11]], following the further deterioration of his health, he resigned as leader of SDP. Translation of his resignation<ref>[http://www.sdp.hr/arhiv/vijesti/ostavka_predsjednika_sdp_a_ivice_racana SDP - resignation]</ref> follows:

{{cquote|

Colleagues, friends, comrades!
Faced with a difficult illness I continue my fight for life but it is time to thank you on our joint work and your support in my political career. We were building together a Social democratic party and I am proud of what we have achieved. I am proud of the social democratic values <U+2013> morals, work, honesty, tolerance <U+2013> that we have forever engraved into the political life of our country. I have done as much as I knew and all that I could. With this I resign from the party presidency and you will have to continue without me. Find a new strength at the election convention for I am sure that it exists in SDP.}}

On the morning of [[April 12]], [[2007]] his condition was described as "critical" due to complications which occurred after he had a couple of [[surgical procedures]] to remove the [[tumor]] on his right [[shoulder]].  On the same day, [[Radio 101]] wrongly reported his death based on "unofficial information from two sources within the party", but SDP officials denied this.  After that, he was reported to be in a critical condition, unable to communicate and under heavy sedation. 

On [[April 29]], [[2007]] at 3:05 am Ivica Ra<U+010D>an died in the Clinical Hospital Centre in Zagreb<ref>[http://vijesti.hrt.hr//ShowArticles.aspx?CategoryId=76&ArticleId=25967 Ivica Ra<U+010D>an dies]</ref>. The reported cause of death was [[kidney cancer]]<ref name="VOA">[http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-04-29-voa6.cfm Former Croatian PM Racan Dies], VOA, 29 April 2007</ref>.
He was laid to rest on Wednesday, [[May 2]], at the Zagreb [[cremation|Crematory]]. Per his wish, only twelve closest friends and family (including wife and both sons) were present. A separate commemoration was organized by the Party in the Lisinski Hall, which was attended by the president, prime minister , various other dignitaries, and numerous party members and followers.

Throughout the three months of Ra<U+010D>an's illness, Croatian media regularly reported on his status due to huge public interest. Ra<U+010D>an himself made no public appearances after the day he announced his illness, but the media was regularly informed through the SDP's spokespeople. This was a situation previously unknown in Croatia, particularly in reference to the death of the late President Tu<U+0111>man, when the events of his illness were well guarded.

When Ra<U+010D>an resigned as the party leader, he made no indication as to his preference for his successor, but instead requested that an election convention be held, where the new leader would be elected by the party membership. Because of pending [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2007|parliamentary elections in November]], this was widely speculated to be relevant for the result of the party at the polls.
