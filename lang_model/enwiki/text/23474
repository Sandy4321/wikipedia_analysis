"'''Coming to Homerica'''" is the twenty-first episode and season finale of the [[The Simpsons (season 20)|twentieth season]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the [[United States]] on May 17, 2009. Its name is a parody of the 1988 film ''[[Coming to America]]''.<ref name=FF/> The storyline is a pick on [[illegal immigration]] to the United States, complete with self-appointed [[vigilante]]s and building a fence to prevent it. Tying in with the episode's subject of Norwegian-descended settlers, its first US broadcast coincided with the [[Norwegian Constitution Day]].

==Plot==
[[Krusty the Clown|Krusty]] is informed that the Krusty Burger is the unhealthiest [[fast food]] in the world (somehow the double krusty burger is healthier), so he decides that his namesake restaurant should serve the "Mother Nature Burger," which is entirely vegetarian. [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] and the townsfolk initially devour the burgers. While at home, Homer wakes up from his nap to find he has a [[stomachache]]. As he finds that all three bathrooms in the house are being used by the family (Who were constantly vomiting), Homer heaves into Lisa's saxophone, and find that the entire town as well had food poisoning. The illness is traced to tainted [[barley]], which was grown in the neighboring town of Ogdenville. The ensuing boycott destroys the local barley industry and the residents of Ogdenville, who are descended from [[Norway|Norwegian]] settlers and portrayed as overly [[stereotype|stereotypical]] [[Minnesota]]ns, are forced to abandon their town (serenaded by the mournful "Aase's Death" composed by Norwegian [[romantic nationalism|national romantic]] composer [[Edvard Grieg]]) and seek employment in Springfield.

The residents of Springfield are initially hospitable to the displaced Ogdenvillians, and hire them as [[day labor]]ers. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] hires several Ogdenvillians to fix his roof, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] hires a nanny named Inga to care for [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]], and [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Selma]] finds love with Thorbj<U+00F8>rn, a brawny blond who also seems to enjoy taunting Homer. After being pressured by some Ogdivillian kids, Bart shows off to them on his skateboard successfully-until he hits a bus, where he dislocates his left arm. Marge and Homer rush Bart to the hospital, and are furious when they need to wait for 6 hours, due to the Ogdivillians taking up a lot of room, and they must also fill out a Norwegian form, due to no English forms left. Marge and Homer take Bart home (where in the process Homer gets a strange cold from one of the Ogdenvillians.) where Marge personally fixes Bart's arm.  Homer goes to [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]]'s Tavern, only to discover that Moe is now serving [[Akvavit|aquavit]], and the bar is full of Ogdenvillians. Homer demands a mug of aquavit, unaware of its strong alcohol content, is instantly intoxicated, and subsequently loses his job at the nuclear power plant when he arrives at work drunk.

Mayor [[Joe Quimby]] calls a town meeting, where it is decided that the Springfield border should be closed to residents of Ogdenville. [[Clancy Wiggum|Chief Wiggum]] and fellow officer Lou are too lazy to control the border themselves, so they distribute guns and beer to a group of [[vigilante]]s, among them Homer, [[Lenny Leonard|Lenny]] and [[Carl Carlson|Carl]]. After Homer asks the assembled crowd to suggest a name for themselves "that evokes America's proud history of citizens rising up to defend our way of life", [[Cletus Spuckler|Cletus]] suggests "The [[Ku Klux Klan|Klan]]" and "[[Nazi Party|The Nazis]]" but this is eventually rejected in favor of the decidedly less offensive "The Star-Spangled Goofballs." After several failed attempts to keep Ogdenvillians out of Springfield, the vigilantes decide to build a wall. At first, Marge believes the wall contradicts the values of tolerance that she taught their children, but changes her mind when Maggie utters her second word, (The first being "daddy", but no one was around to hear it), the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] word "ja" (meaning "yes"). The residents of Springfield begin building a massive wall and ironically hire workers from Ogdenville to assist with its construction since they cannot build it themselves. As the building progresses, the residents of both communities discover that their similarities outweigh their differences. Once the wall is complete, the residents of both communities realize that they miss their neighbors, so the Ogdenvillians come back through a door they built in the wall to join a Springfield party.<ref name=FF>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z2z1z25z1z8&ID=4832|title= May is Massive on Fox|accessdate=2009-04-08|publisher=FoxFlash}}</ref>
