'''''South Park''''' is an [[Television in the United States|American]] animated [[sitcom]] created by [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] for the [[Comedy Central]] [[Cable television|television network]].  Intended for mature audiences, the show has become famous for its crude language, [[Surrealism|surreal]], [[Satire|satirical]], and [[Black comedy|dark humor]] that lampoons [[Subject matter in South Park|a wide range of topics]]. The ongoing narrative revolves around four boys<U+2014>[[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Eric Cartman]] and [[Kenny McCormick]]<U+2014>and their bizarre adventures in and around the titular [[Colorado]] town. In the 2004 documentary "100 Greatest Cartoons" South Park placed at #3, just behind "The Simpsons" and "Tom and Jerry".

Parker and Stone, who met in college, developed the show from [[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)|two animated shorts]] they created in 1992 and 1995. The latter became one of the first Internet [[viral video]]s, which ultimately led to its production as a series. ''South Park'' debuted in August 1997 with great success, consistently earning the highest ratings of any basic cable program. Subsequent ratings have varied, but the show remains Comedy Central's highest rated and longest running program. Originally produced by [[cutout animation]], each episode is now created with [[computer software]] that emulates the show's distinct style. Episodes are typically written and produced during the week preceding its broadcast, with the vast majority of shows being [[Screenwriter|written]], [[Television director|directed]], and [[voice acting|acted]] by Parker and Stone.  After the first couple of seasons, Parker became the only credited writer and director. {{As of|2010}}, a total of [[List of South Park episodes|209 episodes]] have aired during the show's fourteen seasons. Parker and Stone are under contract to produce 14 new episodes in <!-- DO ''not'' CHANGE. Read source -->2011<!-- DO ''not'' CHANGE.

Following the early success of the series, the feature length [[musical film]] ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' had a widespread theatrical release in June 1999. ''South Park'' has also received numerous media awards, including four [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s. The show has also garnered a [[Peabody Award]] for Comedy Central.

==Origins and creation==

{{Main|The Spirit of Christmas (short film)}}
Soon after meeting in film class at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] in 1992, Parker and Stone created an [[short subject|animated short]] entitled ''[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)|The Spirit of Christmas]]''.<ref name="fortune" /> The film was created by animating construction paper cutouts with [[stop motion]], and features [[prototype]]s of the main characters of ''South Park'', including a character resembling Cartman but named "Kenny", an unnamed character resembling what is today Kenny, and two near-identical unnamed characters who resemble Stan and Kyle. [[Brian Graden]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] executive and mutual friend, commissioned Parker and Stone to create a second short film as a video [[Christmas card]]. Created in 1995, the second ''The Spirit of Christmas'' short resembled the style of the later series more closely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=Arts&articleID=1811&month=11&day=9&year=2007|title=The evolution of South Park|date=2007-11-09|publisher=www.gazette.uwo.ca
| accessdate=2009-08-09|last=Gregoris|first=Michael}}</ref> To differentiate between the two homonymous shorts, the first short is often referred to as ''Jesus vs. Frosty'', and the second short as ''Jesus vs. Santa.'' Graden sent copies of the video to several of his friends, and from there it was copied and distributed, including on the [[Internet]], where it became one of the first [[viral video]]s.<ref name="fortune" /><ref name="time2">{{cite news | author = Jeffrey Ressner and James Collins|title = Gross And Grosser | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 1998-03-23 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988028-2,00.html | accessdate = 2009-04-28}}</ref>

As ''Jesus vs. Santa'' became more popular, Parker and Stone began talks of developing the short into a television series.

Parker and Stone assembled a small staff and spent three months creating the [[Television pilot|pilot]] episode "[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]".<ref name="apple" /> ''South Park'' was in danger of being canceled before it even aired when the show tested poorly with test audiences, particularly with women. However, the shorts were still gaining more popularity over the Internet, and Comedy Central agreed to order a run of six episodes.<ref name="mcfarland1" /><ref name="paulson" /> ''South Park'' debuted with "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" on August 13, 1997.<ref name="seriously227">Fallows and Weinstock, p. 227</ref>

The characters and objects are composed of simple geometrical shapes and [[primary color]]s. Most child characters are the same size and shape, and are distinguished by their clothing and headwear.<ref name="tvamerica" /> Characters are mostly presented two-dimensionally and from only one angle.

===Music===
[[File:Isaac hayes 1973.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An adult male with sunglasses plays a piano under a spotlight on a darkened stage, 1973|[[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] would often sing in a style reminiscent of that of his voice actor, [[Isaac Hayes]]]]

Parker says that the varying uses of music is of utmost importance to ''South Park''.<ref name="philomusic">Arp and Broman, pp. 236<U+2013>249</ref> Several characters often play or sing songs in order to change or influence a group's behavior, or to educate, motivate, or indoctrinate others. The show also frequently features scenes in which its characters have disapproving reactions to the performances of certain popular musicians.<ref name="philomusic" />

[[Adam Berry]], the show's original score composer, used [[sound synthesis]] to simulate a small orchestra, and frequently alluded to existing famous pieces of music. Berry also used signature acoustic guitar and mandolin cues as [[leitmotif]]s for the show's establishing shots.<ref name="philomusic" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/features/article/?id=7|title=Eating Cheesy Poofs with Adam Berry|date=1998-12-05|publisher=www.soundtrack.net|accessdate=2009-05-23|last=Goldwasser|first=Dan}}</ref> After Berry left in 2001, Jamie Dunlap and Scott Nickoley of the Los Angeles-based Mad City Production Studios provided the show's original music for the next seven seasons.<ref name="digizine" /> Since 2008, Dunlap has been credited as the show's sole score composer.<ref name="showcredits">{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/behind/cast.php|title=Cast and Crew <U+2013> South Park Studios|publisher=www.southparkstudios.com|accessdate=2009-05-23|last=|first=}}</ref> Dunlap's contributions to the show are one of the few that are not achieved at the show's own production offices. Dunlap reads a script, creates a score using digital audio software, and then e-mails the audio file to South Park Studios, where it is edited to fit with the completed episode.<ref name="digizine" />

In addition to singing in an effort to explain something to the children, Chef would also sing about things relevant to what had transpired in the plot. These songs were original compositions written by Parker, and performed by Hayes in the same sexually suggestive [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] style he had utilized during his own music career. The band [[DVDA (band)|DVDA]], which consists of Parker and Stone, along with show staff members Bruce Howell and D.A. Young, would perform the music for these compositions, and, until the character's death on the show, were listed as "Chef's Band" in the closing credits.<ref name="method" />

[[Rick James]], [[Elton John]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Joe Strummer]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], and [[Ween]] all guest starred and briefly performed in the [[South Park (season 2)|season two]] (1998) episode "[[Chef Aid]]". Korn debuted their single "[[Falling Away from Me]]" as guest stars on the [[South Park (season 3)|season three]] (1999) episode "[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]".<ref name="mtvkorn" />

==Reception==
===Ratings===

When ''South Park'' debuted, it was a huge ratings success for [[Comedy Central]] and is seen as being largely responsible for the success of the channel, with Herzog crediting it for putting the network "on the map".<ref name="fortune" /><ref name="nytad" /><ref name="bc68">Johnson-Woods, pp. 6<U+2013>8</ref>

The show's first episode, "[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]", earned a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] rating of 1.3 (980,000 viewers), at the time considered high for a [[Cable television in the United States|cable program]].<ref name="bc68" /> The show instantly generated buzz among television viewers, and mass viewing parties began assembling on college campuses.<ref name="whois" /><ref name="nytimescarter" /><ref name="sfrubin" /> By the time the eighth episode "[[Starvin' Marvin (South Park)|Starvin' Marvin]]" aired three months after the show debuted, ratings and viewership had tripled, and ''South Park'' was already the most successful show in Comedy Central's history.<ref name="sfrubin" /> When the tenth episode "[[Damien (South Park)|Damien]]" aired the following February, viewership increased another 33 percent. The episode earned a 6.4 rating, which at the time was over 10 times the average rating earned by a cable show aired in [[prime time]].<ref name="nytimescarter" /><ref name="bc68" /> The ratings peaked with the second episode of [[South Park (season 2)|season two]], "[[Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut]]", which aired on April 22, 1998. The episode earned an 8.2 rating (6.2 million viewers) and, at the time, set a record as the highest-rated non-sports show in basic cable history.<ref name="augusta2" /><ref name="wilonsky" /><ref name="bc68" /> During the spring of 1998, eight of the ten highest-rated shows on basic cable were ''South Park'' episodes.<ref name="nydailyratings" />

The success of ''South Park'' prompted more cable companies to carry Comedy Central and led it to its becoming one of the fastest-growing cable channels. The number of households that had Comedy Central jumped from 9.1 million in 1997 to 50 million in June 1998.<ref name="bc68" /> When the show debuted, the most Comedy Central had earned for a 30-second commercial was US$7,500.<ref name="nytimescarter" /> Within a year, advertisers were paying an average of US$40,000 for 30 seconds of advertising time during airings of ''South Park'' in its second season, while some paid as much as US$80,000.<ref name="salon">{{cite news| author = David Horowitz |title = Why Gore would censor "South Park"| publisher = Salon.com| date= 1999-07-19|url = http://www.salon.com/news/col/horo/1999/07/19/south_park/index2.html| accessdate = 2009-05-12}}</ref>

By the third season ([[1999 in television|1999]]), the series' ratings began to decrease.<ref>

The ratings eventually increased, and seasons five through nine consistently averaged about 3 million viewers per episode.<ref name="bc68" /> Though its viewership is lower than it was at the height of its popularity in its earliest seasons, ''South Park'' remains the highest-rated series on Comedy Central.<ref name="fortune" /><ref name="cityjournal" /> The [[South Park (season 14)|season 14]] (2010) premiere gained 3.7 million viewers, the show's highest-rated season premiere since 1998.<ref>[http://www.popcrunch.com/tiger-woods-scandal-helps-south-park-set-ratings-record/ Tiger Woods Scandal Helps <U+201C>South Park<U+201D> Set Ratings Record] PopCrunch.

The show's frequent depiction of taboo subject matter, general toilet humor, accessibility to younger viewers, disregard for conservative sensibilities, and portrayal of religion for comic effect have been the main sources for generating controversy and debate over the course of its run.

The season fourteen episodes [[200 (South Park)|200]] and [[201 (South Park)|201]] were mired in controversy for satirizing issues surrounding the depiction of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.
The website for the organization [[Revolution Muslim]], a New York-based radical Muslim organization, posted an entry that included a warning to creators Parker and Stone that they risk violent retribution for their [[depictions of Muhammad]]. It said that they "will probably wind up like Theo Van Gogh for airing this show." Filmmaker [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo Van Gogh]] was murdered by an Islamic extremist in 2004 for making a short documentary on violence against women in some Islamic societies. The posting provided the addresses to Comedy Central in New York and the production company in Los Angeles.

In the [[South Park (season 2)|season two]] episode "[[Chef Aid]]", attorney [[Johnnie Cochran]] uses what's called in the show the [[Chewbacca defense]], which is a legal strategy that involves addressing plot holes related to [[Chewbacca]] in the film ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'' rather than discussing the trial at hand during a closing argument in a deliberate attempt to confuse jurors into thinking there is [[reasonable doubt]].

Another season two episode, "[[Gnomes (South Park)|Gnomes]]", revolves around a group of "underpants [[gnome]]s" who, as their name suggests, run a corporation stealing people's underpants. When asked about their business model, various gnomes reply that theirs is a three-step process: Phase 1 is "collect underpants". Phase 3 is "profit". However, the gnomes are unable to explain what is to occur between the first and final steps, and "Phase 2" is accompanied by a large question mark on their corporate flow chart. Using "????" and "PROFIT!" as the last two steps in a process (usually jokingly) has become a widely popular [[Internet meme]] because of this. Especially in the context of politics and economics, "underpants gnomes" has been used by some commentators to characterize a conspicuous gap of logic or planning.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124329131991652291.html|title=Obama and the 'South Park' Gnomes|author=Bret Stephens|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2009-06-01 | date=2009-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://webnotes.net/?uGIOp6|title=Small Government Egalitarianism|author=Matt Yglesias|publisher=Think Progress|accessdate=2009-06-01}}</ref>

The two claim the show's higher ratio of instances lampooning liberal orthodoxies stems simply from their preference to make fun of liberals more than conservatives.<ref name="cornell" /><ref name="abc3" /> While Stone has been quoted saying "I hate conservatives, but I really fucking hate liberals", Stone and Parker have explained that their drive to lampoon a given target comes first from the target's insistence on telling other people how to behave.<ref name="gillespie" /> The duo explains that they perceive liberals as having both delusions of entitlement to remain free from satire, and a propensity to enforce political correctness while patronizing the citizens of [[Middle America (US)|Middle America]].<ref name="nytimesconserv" /><ref name="cityjournal" /> Parker and Stone are uncomfortable with the idea of themselves or ''South Park'' being applied with any kind of partisan classification,<ref name="mcfarland1" /><ref name="refugees" /> and both reject the "''South Park'' Republican" and "''South Park'' conservative" labels as a serious notion, feeling that either tag implies that one only adheres to strictly conservative or [[libertarianism|libertarian]] viewpoints.<ref name="rs1" /><ref name="theadvocates" /> Canadian columnist Jaime J. Weinman observes that the most die-hard conservatives who identified themselves as "''South Park'' Republicans" began turning away from the label when the show ridiculed Republicans in the [[South Park (season 9)|season nine]] (2005) episode "[[Best Friends Forever]]".<ref name="growsup2" />
