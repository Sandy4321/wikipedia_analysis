'''Johannes Blaskowitz''' ([[10 July]] [[1883]] - [[5 February]] [[1948]]) was a [[Germany|German]] general during [[World War II]]. 

==Biography==
===Early years===
Blaskowitz was born at [[Peterswalde]], Kreis [[Wehlau]] ([[East Prussia]]). 
He served as an infantry officer during [[World War I]].

===Poland 1939===
During the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Invasion of Poland]] that began [[World War II]], he commanded the [[German Eighth Army]]. He was Commander-in-Chief East (''Oberbefehlshaber Ost'') in Poland from [[October 20]] [[1939]]. There he was repeatedly outraged by the atrocities committed by the [[SS]] and the [[Einsatzgruppen]] against Polish and [[Jewish]] people and issued two detailed memoranda to Commander-in-Chief [[Walther von Brauchitsch]] on these [[war crime]]s. He even did not hesitate to impose [[death sentence]]s against members of the SS and [[Gestapo]] in case of involvement in war crimes (these sentences were later abolished by [[Hitler]]). He used an exceptionally open language:

''The attitude of the troops against the SS and the police fluctuates between disgust and hatred. Every soldier feels cloyed by these crimes committed against the Poles by citizens of the [[Third Reich|Reich]] and representatives of the government.'' (Aide memoir January 1940).

Hitler was reportedly infuriated by Blaskowitz's "childish attitude", and he was relieved of command in Poland on [[May 14]] [[1940]] at the insistence of [[Governor General]] [[Hans Frank]].

===French Campaign 1940 and the occupation of France===

During the French Campaign Blaskowitz was transferred to command 9th Army in the west. In early June 1940 he became Military Governor of Northern France. 

Blaskowitz held this position until October 1940 when he was transferred to the command of the First Army. He retained this post until May 1944 when he was named commander-in-chief of Army Group G. 

===Campaign in the West 1944-5===

He was relieved of command of Army Group G in late September 1944 after officially protesting about SS atrocities in Poland, and reinstated on [[24 December]] [[1944]]. On [[28 January]] [[1945]] he was appointed commander-in-chief of Army Group H. This command was redesignated in early April 1945 and Blaskowitz became commander-in-chief in the Netherlands. 

On [[May 5]] Blaskowitz was summoned to the [[Hotel de Wereld]] ("''The World Hotel''") in [[Wageningen]] by General [[Charles Foulkes (1903-1969)|Charles Foulkes]] (commander of [[I Canadian Corps]]) to discuss the surrender of the German forces in the Netherlands. [[Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands|Prince Bernhard]], acting as commander-in-chief of the Dutch Interior Forces, attended the meeting as well. Blaskowitz agreed with all proposals by Foulkes. However, nowhere in the building - some sources claim: nowhere in the whole town - a typewriter could be found. Thus the surrender document could not be typed. The next day both parties returned, and in the presence of both General Foulkes and Prince Bernhard, Blaskowitz signed the surrender document which in the meantime had been typed.

===Post war===

Blaskowitz was charged with war crimes and tried before a [[United States|U.S.]] [[Subsequent Nuremberg Trials|military court]] in the [[High Command Trial]], but committed suicide during the trial on [[February 5]], [[1948]] by jumping out of a window of [[Nuremberg]] prison. Rumors spread by cell mates that he may have been murdered by SS men have never been substantiated.
