The '''SCP Foundation''' is a creative writing website. The website describes the exploits of the SCP Foundation, a fictional organization responsible for containing anomalies entities, locations and objects that violate natural law. The SCP Foundation has inspired many spin-off works, including [[SCP <U+2013> Containment Breach]].
==Overview of series==
[[Fictional universe|In universe]], the SCP Foundation is a secret organization entrusted by global governments to contain anomalous entities, locations and objects that defy natural law (referred to as SCPs). If left uncontained, the SCPs would threaten global security, human health, and humanity's sense of normalcy.<ref name=SCiP>{{cite web|last1=The Administrator|title=About The SCP Foundation|url=http://www.scp-wiki.net/about-the-scp-foundation|website=SCP Foundation|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref>

The existence of SCPs are kept secret by the SCP Foundation to prevent mass panics and to allow human civilization to function normally. When an SCP is discovered, the SCP Foundation deploys mobile task forces (MTFs) to either transport the SCP to one of the Foundation's global facilities or to contain it at its location of discovery if transport is not possible. Once SCPs are contained, they are studied by Foundation scientists to gain a greater understanding of the contained SCPs. Prison inmates (D-class) are used to interact with SCPs due to the danger posed by the SCPs and the expendability of the D-class.<ref name="SCiP"/> 

The SCP Foundation maintains a data base of special containment procedures for all of the SCPs that they contain. The containment procedures provide summaries of the SCPs and instructions for keeping them safely contained.<ref name="SCiP"/>

==Community==
The SCP Foundation series originated in the /x/ forum of [[4chan]], where the first special containment procedure was posted during 2007. In 2008, the SCP Foundation series was moved to its current [[Wikidot]] website.<ref name="day"/> The Wikidot website has received media attention for its creative writing contests. The contests are free to enter for website members.<ref name="cross"/> However, users need to submit an application before they are allowed to contribute content to the website.<ref name="day"/> Writers from the [[Daily Dot]] and [[Bustle (website)|Bustle]] have noted that the website maintains strict quality control standards, and that sub-par content tends to be quickly deleted.<ref name="day"/><ref name=bust>{{cite web|last1=Peters|first1=Lucia|title=The 10 Scariest Urban Legends on the Internet to Bring a Shiver to Your Spine This Halloween|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/38889-the-10-scariest-urban-legends-on-the-internet-to-bring-a-shiver-to-your-spine-this#!|website=Bustle|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>

The SCP Foundation also maintains a forum on [[Reddit]] and a [[role-playing]] community.<ref name="day"/>

==Analysis of writing==
The core of the SCP Foundation series is a listing of over two-thousand special containment procedures,. The procedures describe SCPs and provide guidelines for safely containing them. They also sort the SCPs into one of three classes: Safe for objects easily contained, Euclid for objects that are unpredictable, and Keter for objects that require extensive containment procedures and which pose a large-scale threat to human life.<ref name="day"/> In addition, the containment procedures may provide the history of the entities and any testing performed on them.<ref name="day"/> The reports are written in an empirical tone and often [[redact]] information. <ref>{{cite web|last1=Dinicola|first1=Nick|title=Creepypasta Gaming: Where the Internet "Learns Our Fears"|url=http://www.popmatters.com/column/188172-creepypasta-gaming-where-the-internet-learns-our-fears/|website=Pop Matters|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> The SCP Foundation series also contains several hundred "Foundation tales", which are short stories written within the SCP Foundation universe.<ref name="day"/> 

The SCP Foundation does not have a central canon. Rather, each containment procedure and tale forms its own continuity.<ref name="day"/>

==Reception==
The SCP Foundation has received largely positive reviews. Michelle Starr of [[CNET]] praised the creepy nature of the series.<ref name=net>{{cite web|last1=Starr|first1=Michelle|title=SCP Foundation web series coming to YouTube|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/scp-foundation-web-series-coming-to-youtube/#!|website=CNET|accessdate=6 February 2015|ref=a}}</ref> Gavin Baker-Whitelaw, writing for the [[Daily Dot]], praised the originality of the SCP Foundation and described it as the "most uniquely compelling horror writing on the Internet".<ref name="day"/> He noted that special containment procedures rarely contained gratuitous gore. Rather, the horror of the series was often established through the reports' "pragmatic" and "deadpan" style, as well as through the inclusion of detail.<ref name=day>{{cite web|last1=Baker-Whitelaw|first1=Gavin|title=Meet the secret foundation that contains the world's paranormal artifacts|url=http://www.dailydot.com/fandom/scp-foundation-paranormal-artifact-containment-horror/|website=The Daily Dot|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> Lisay Suhay, writing for the [[Christian Science Monitor]], also praised the SCP Foundation's "tongue in-cheek style".<ref name=cross>{{cite web|last1=Suhay|first1=Lisa|title=Urban Druid writing contest: What's behind the dark-side fiction?|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Culture-Cafe/2014/1110/Urban-Druid-writing-contest-What-s-behind-the-dark-side-fiction|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref>

Alex Eichler, writing for [[i09]], noted that the series had varying levels of quality and that some of the reports were dull or repetitive. However, he praised the SCP Foundation for not becoming overly dim and for containing more light-hearted reports. Additionally, he praised the wide variety of concepts covered in the report, and noted that the SCP Foundation contained writings that would appeal to all readers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Eichler|first1=Alex|title=Enter the SCP Foundation's Bottomless Catalog of the Weird|url=http://io9.com/5476680/enter-the-scp-foundations-bottomless-catalog-of-the-weird|website=i09|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>

==Fan works==
The SCP Foundation has inspired multiple [[indie games|independent video games]]. The most popular of these games is [[SCP <U+2013> Containment Breach]]. In the game, the protagonist is a member of D-class who escapes during a containment breach. The main antagonist of the game is SCP-173, a concrete statue that moves towards and attacks the player when not observed. A blink mechanic was included in the game to force players to occasional shut their eyes.<ref name="day"/>  Another popular SCP Foundation video game is SCP-087. The game is a first-person horror game whose plots centers around walking down a flight of stairs and avoiding the SCP of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Adam|title=The Neverending Stairway: SCP-087|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/02/21/the-neverending-stairway-scp-087/|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>

In addition to video games, a live-action web-series entered production in 2013 which was based off of the SCP Foundation.<ref name="net"/>
