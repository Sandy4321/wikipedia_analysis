[[Australian cricket team|Australia]] played in the first-ever [[Test cricket|Test match]] in [[cricket]] in 1877, the first-ever [[one-day international]] in 1971 (both against [[English cricket team|England]]) and the first-ever [[Twenty20]] international in 2005 (against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]]). This is a '''list of the men, boys and women who have been the official Australian captains in Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals'''. There have been two major rebel Australian sides. In the 1970s many of Australia's leading players signed up for [[Kerry Packer]]'s [[World Series Cricket]] and played in a number of SuperTests against other international sides. Then in the mid-1980s there were two rebel Australian tours to [[South African cricket team|South Africa]], which was at that time banned from official competition because of the [[apartheid]] r<U+00E9>gime then in force there. The captains of those Australian sides are also listed below.

==Test match captains==
This is a list of cricketers who have [[captain (cricket)|captained]] the [[Australian cricket team]] for at least one [[Test cricket|Test match]]. Where a player has a dagger (&dagger;) next to a Test match series in which he captained at least one Test, that denotes that player deputised for the appointed captain or were appointed by the home authority for a minor proportion in a series. The dagger classification follows that adopted by ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]''.

The series was tied two-all with one draw. The "Victory Tests" have not, however, been granted full Test status.
