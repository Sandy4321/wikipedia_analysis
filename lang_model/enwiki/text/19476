It was first announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009|E3 2009]] and is the sequel to ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]''. It was released in North America on May 23, 2010, in Japan on May 27, 2010, in Europe on June 11, 2010, and in Australia on July 1, 2010. It is the fourth original 3D platformer in the [[Mario (series)|''Mario'' series]], after ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'',<!-- Do NOT add Super Mario 64 DS. It is a remake, not an original game.--> and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]].''

The story follows the protagonist [[Mario]] as he pursues the antagonist [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] into outer space, who has captured [[Princess Peach]] and taken control of the universe using Power Stars. Mario's subsequent adventures revolve around traveling to various galaxies to recover the Power Stars in order to travel to the center of the universe and rescue the princess.

The game was originally planned as a simple iteration of ''Super Mario Galaxy'' with few modifications and a projected development time of a year (this version would be called ''More Super Mario Galaxy''). It was later decided that the game was to be developed as a fleshed-out sequel when the development staff continued to build upon the game with dozens of new ideas, and so development time expanded to two and a half years. Among the additions are dynamic environments, new [[power-up]]s, and, most notably, the ability to ride [[Yoshi]].

Upon its release, ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'' was met with critical acclaim, and it has been hailed as one of the greatest video games of all time by aggregation sites such as [[Metacritic]] and [[GameRankings]]. The game is one of the [[List of best-selling Wii video games|best-selling games on the Wii]] with 6.36 million copies sold worldwide.

==Gameplay==
{{See also|Super Mario Galaxy#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay in Super Mario Galaxy}}

The gameplay of ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'' is similar to that of the first ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', with a focus on [[Platform game|platforming]] based on and around 3D planets (referred to collectively as galaxies)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://littlebobeep.com/2010/open-letter-creators-super-mario-galaxy-2/ |title=Open Letter to the Creators of Super Mario Galaxy 2 |publisher=LittleBoBeep |date=2010-04-07| accessdate=2011-07-21}}</ref> with varying themes, sizes, and landscapes. The player controls [[Mario]] (or later in the game, his brother [[Luigi]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Words: Henry Gilbert, GamesRadar US |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/wii/super-mario-galaxy-2/news/luigi-in-mario-galaxy-2-official-japanese-site-says-yes/a-20100422145740537034/g-2009060210524839056 |title=Luigi in Mario Galaxy 2?

Like the original, the objective of the game is to travel to the various galaxies and collect Power Stars, which are awarded by completing levels and accomplishing tasks and are used to open access to later levels. The game retains some gameplay mechanics introduced in the original, such as the blue Star Pointer that allows the player to pick up Star Bits and shoot them at enemies, levels that restrict movement to a 2D plane, balance ball levels, and gravity-reversing background arrows.<ref name=GT />

===Setting and level design===
''Super Mario Galaxy 2'' provides the player access to the game's galaxies through means of a [[overworld|map system]] similar to that in previous ''Mario'' games such as ''[[Super Mario World]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]''.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jason| last=Leavey|url=http://www.thetanooki.com/2010/03/22/no-hub-world-in-super-mario-galaxy-2/ |title=No hub world in Super Mario Galaxy 2? |publisher=The Tanooki |date=2010-03-22 |accessdate=2010-04-08}}</ref> This is navigated via a mobile planet called Starship Mario (so named because it is shaped like Mario's head<ref name=GT />) that serves as a [[Level (video gaming)|hub world]], which can be visited anytime and is expanded upon when new abilities are unlocked.<ref name="brettelston">{{cite web|author=Words: Brett Elston, GamesRadar US |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/wii/super-mario-galaxy-2/preview/super-mario-galaxy-2-light-yoshi-rock-mario-and-more/a-20100330175822274016/g-2009060210524839056/p-2 |title=Super Mario Galaxy 2: Light Yoshi, Rock Mario and more, Super Mario Galaxy 2 Wii Previews |publisher=GamesRadar |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2010-04-08}}</ref> The game contains forty-nine galaxies allotted among seven different regions in the [[universe]] (called "worlds"), the general difficulty progressively increasing in each world. The first six worlds end with a [[boss (gaming)|boss level]] against [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] or Bowser Jr. that, when conquered, allow the player to access the next world. When the player collects all 120 Power Stars, 120 Green Star levels are unlocked. These levels contain Green Stars that are hidden or are placed in hard-to-reach areas, focusing on heavy exploration and precision that could result in instant [[death]] if the player fails. Acquiring all 120 Green Stars awards the player with the final, forty-ninth galaxy with two new challenges that are considered exceptionally difficult.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/14354736/page_4.html |title=Super Mario Galaxy 2 Guide/Walkthrough - Wii, Wii Walkthrough - IGN |publisher=IGN |date=2010-03-29 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref> ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'' contains 242 unique Power Stars to collect overall.<ref>{{cite web|first=Samuel |last=Claiborn |url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/14354736/ |title=Super Mario Galaxy 2 Guide |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2010-05-28}}</ref>

Most of the [[level design|levels]] in ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'' each offer a unique task based around its theme, and many focus on dynamic environments that change or alternate between various states. For example, some environments change to the [[beat (music)|beat]] of the [[video game music|background music]], such as sudden shifts in the direction of gravity or the appearance or disappearance of platforms; and others feature a special switch that temporarily slows down time. Prankster Comets, which were featured in the original game and cause variation and tougher challenges in levels, no longer appear randomly in visited galaxies but instead require the collection of a Comet Medal in that galaxy in order for it to appear.<ref>{{cite web|first=Stephen| last=Totilo|url=http://kotaku.com/5479475/planet-mario-and-map-suggest-super-mario-galaxy-2-secrets/ |title=Planet Mario And Map Suggest Super Mario Galaxy 2 Secrets - Super Mario Galaxy 2 |publisher=Kotaku |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2010-04-08}}</ref> In addition, Prankster Comets have become more general and offer any number of variations: while ''Super Mario Galaxy'' offered only five mutually exclusive variations, the Prankster Comets in ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'' range to any number of challenges that often mix or overlap, such as destroying all the enemies, collecting 100 Purple Coins, and completing the level within a time limit or while avoiding Cosmic Clones ([[doppelg<U+00E4>nger]]s of Mario that pursue and imitate all the player's actions). As a result, both the dynamic environments and the Prankster Comets often create challenges with puzzle elements, requiring precision and strategy in order to overcome them.<ref name="Gamrad">{{cite web| last = McAllister| first = Jeff| title = Super Mario Galaxy 2 Comet Medal Guide| publisher = GamesRadar| date = 2010| url = http://www.gamesradar.com/f/super-mario-galaxy-2-comet-coin-guide/a-20100524134513853015| accessdate = 2011-07-15}}</ref>

===Power-ups===
[[File:Smg2cloudmario.jpg|left|thumb|Cloud Mario is one of the new power-ups in the game. Mario is using the power-up, creating temporary platforms in midair to get to out-of-reach places.]]
All the original transformations in ''Super Mario Galaxy'' return except for Ice Mario and Flying Mario, along with some new [[power-up]]s and items. These include the Spin Drill, which allows the player to burrow through planets and emerge out the other side;<ref name=GT /> Rock Mario, which allows the player to smash through obstacles, such as boulders and enemies;<ref name="brettelston"/> and Cloud Mario, which allows the player to create temporary platforms in midair.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Fahey|url=http://kotaku.com/5518944/super-mario-galaxy-2-forecast-cloudy-with-a-chance-of-plumbers |title=Super Mario Galaxy 2 Forecast Cloudy With A Chance Of Plumbers |publisher=Kotaku |date=2010-04-16 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref>

Mario is able to ride the dinosaur [[Yoshi]], who is available in certain levels. When riding Yoshi, the player's blue Star Pointer is replaced by a red dot, which allows the player to point at various objects and manipulate them with Yoshi's tongue.<ref name="trailer">{{cite web |title=Super Mario Galaxy 2 E3 09: Debut Trailer |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/e3-09-super-mario/50233 |publisher=GameTrailers |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2009-06-03}}</ref> Yoshi can also use his tongue to swing across gaps, pull levers, and swallow enemies (with the option to spit them back out as projectiles).<ref name=GT>{{cite web| title = Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review| publisher = [[GameTrailers]]| date = 2010-05-21| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/video/review-super-mario/100404| accessdate = 2010-05-22}}</ref> There are also three different power-up [[fruit]]s available for Yoshi to eat that grant him temporary abilities. These are the Dash Pepper, the Blimp Fruit and the Bulb Berry. The Dash Pepper allows Yoshi to run quickly, giving him the ability to walk up walls and walk on water; the Blimp Fruit allows Yoshi to float into the air; and the Bulb Berry allows Yoshi to reveal secret pathways.<ref name="fruit">{{cite web |title=Super Mario Galaxy &#124; Nintendo &#124; Wii games |url=http://www.supermariogalaxy.com/#/mario-yoshi/yoshi-power-ups/ |publisher=Official Nintendo Magazine |accessdate=2011-07-03}}</ref>

===Guides and multiplayer===
Because of the game's increased difficulty over the original, ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'' offers some features that assist inexperienced or frustrated players. The most notable is the Cosmic Guide, similar to ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'s'' "Super Guide" feature. The Cosmic Guide appears if the player has failed during a particular level a certain number of times, and allows the player to give computer control over Mario in order to complete the level if necessary. The drawback is that the player is awarded a [[Bronze medal|Bronze]] Star, requiring them to complete it themselves in order to earn a Golden Power Star.<ref name="cosmicguide">{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Fahey|url=http://kotaku.com/5521248/a-look-at-super-mario-galaxy-2s-cosmic-guide-and-cloud-mario |title=A Look At Super Mario Galaxy 2's Cosmic Guide and Cloud Mario |publisher=Kotaku |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref> There are also [[video monitor|monitor]]s called "Hint TVs" that will demonstrate how to perform a specific move or optimal ways of using a power-up.<ref>{{cite web|author=Posted: Apr 23, 2010 |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/fluffy-bluff-super-mario/64801 |title=Super Mario Galaxy 2 Video Game, Fluffy Bluff Gameplay Part I (Cam) &#124; Game Trailers & Videos |publisher=GameTrailers |date=2010-04-23 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref>

[[Multiplayer]] gameplay has also been expanded upon over the original. In ''Super Mario Galaxy'', another player could use a second [[Wii Remote]] to control a second Star Pointer and assist Mario by grabbing onto enemies or collecting and shooting Star Bits. In ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'', the second player now controls an orange Luma who retains all the original abilities, but can also physically attack enemies and collect items and power-ups, making the player's involvement more useful.<ref name="cosmicguide" />

==Plot==
Following from where ''Super Mario Galaxy'' left off, [[Princess Peach]] invites [[Mario]] to share some cake at the Star Festival, a time when Star Bits rain down from the skies over the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. On his way, Mario finds a Luma, who immediately befriends him and grants him the ability to spin. Shortly thereafter, Mario's archnemesis [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], who has grown to an immense size (after swallowing Grand Stars, unbeknownst to Mario at this point), appears and attacks Princess Peach's Castle. Kidnapping the princess, Bowser escapes into [[outer space]] to recreate his empire at the center of the universe. After launching into outer space, Mario is given control of Starship Mario, a mobile [[minor planet|planetoid]] in the shape of his head, made by a crafty Luma mechanic called Lubba, powered by Power Stars, and piloted by other Lumas; his mission is to fly across the universe in pursuit of Bowser and the Princess and to help Lubba find the lost Lumas that were part of Bowser's plot. Along the way Mario meets new Lumas and joins up with his companion Yoshi, the Toad Brigade from the original ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', and his brother [[Luigi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gonintendo.com/viewstory.php?id=121308 |title=GoNintendo - Super Mario Galaxy 2 - 'Story' press release |date=2010-04-22 |publisher=GoNintendo |accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref>

Upon collecting enough Power Stars, Starship Mario reaches Bowser's main fortification, draining energy from what appears to be a comet. Mario infiltrates the castle and defeats Bowser, retrieving the last Grand Star. [[List of Mario series characters#Princess Rosalina|Rosalina]] and her Comet Observatory from the first ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' appear before Mario and Peach. Rosalina thanks Mario for watching over the Luma that he had found, and the Luma returns to the Comet Observatory, taking Mario's hat with him. Mario and his friends return to the Mushroom Kingdom and celebrate their victory. The game ends with Starship Mario sitting above Princess Peach's Castle and the Comet Observatory streaking across the sky.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Super Mario Galaxy 2 |developer=[[Nintendo EAD]] Tokyo |level=Bowser's Galaxy Generator |quote='''Bowser''': Raawwwrrgh!

==Development==
After Nintendo finished making ''Super Mario Galaxy'', [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] approached the development team and suggested that a follow-up be produced. The game was originally planned just to do variations on the original game's planets and call the game "''More Super Mario Galaxy''",<ref name ="andriasang blog"/> (it was dubbed "''Super Mario Galaxy 1.5''" during early development), with a projected development time of approximately a year. The first elements that were implemented were anything that was scrapped from the original game, either to ensure [[game balance]] or simply because of time constraints, such as [[Yoshi]] and the concept of a planet shaped like Mario's head. Over time, more and more new elements and ideas were brought into the game, and it was decided that the game would be a fleshed-out sequel rather than a slightly modified follow-up. Thus, development took two and a half years. Takeshi Hayakawa, the lead [[game programmer|programmer]] for ''Super Mario Galaxy 2,'' created a [[level editor|development tool]] that allowed different staff members, including visual and sound designers, to easily design and create stages without waiting for programmers, many of which were incorporated into the final game.<ref name ="andriasang blog">{{cite web|last=Gantayat |first=Anoop |url=http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2010/05/18/iwata_asks_mario_staff/ |title=Super Mario Galaxy 2 Staff Quizzed by Iwata |publisher=andriasang |date=2010-05-18 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}</ref> In order to help distinguish ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'' from its predecessor, the staff originally wanted the whole game to revolve around the concept of "switching," in which the game's environments would dramatically change under certain conditions. This concept ended up being particularly difficult to implement full-scale, so was relegated to only certain levels.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/supermariogalaxy2/vol2_page3.jsp |title=Wii.com - Iwata Asks: Super Mario Galaxy 2 |publisher=US.Wii.com |date=2010 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}</ref> Game [[tutorial]]s were confined to an optional system called the "Tip Network" in order to benefit players already familiar with the original game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/supermariogalaxy2/vol1_page3.jsp |title=Wii.com - Iwata Asks: Super Mario Galaxy 2 |publisher=US.Wii.com |date=2010 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}</ref> Miyamoto compared ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'' to ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]'', in that both games use the same engines as their predecessors, yet build upon their foundations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/supermariogalaxy2/vol1_page1.jsp |title=Wii.com - Iwata Asks: Super Mario Galaxy 2 |publisher=US.Wii.com |date=2010 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref>

''Super Mario Galaxy 2'' was revealed at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009]] on June 2. In Miyamoto's private conference, it was stated that the game was very far along in development, but its release was held back to mid-2010 due to ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'''s release in late 2009. Miyamoto also stated that the game has 95<U+2013>99% new features, with the rest being previous features introduced in ''Super Mario Galaxy.''<ref>{{cite web | title=E3 2009: Shigeru Miyamoto Roundtable LiveBlog | url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/989/989996p1.html | work= | publisher=IGN | date=2009-06-02 | accessdate=2009-06-03}}</ref> With regard to the original game, [[Nintendo of America]] President and CEO [[Reggie Fils-Aime]] stated in an interview that the sequel would be more challenging,<ref>{{cite web | first=Matt | last=Casamassina | title=E3 2009: Reggie Fils-Aime on the Record | url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/989/989857p1.html | work= | publisher=IGN | date=2009-06-02 | accessdate=2009-06-03}}</ref> and Miyamoto said in a ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' interview that the game would have less focus on plot.<ref>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Kohler |url=http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/06/super-mario-galaxy-2/ |title=Miyamoto: Why I Spiked Mario Galaxy 2's Story |publisher=Wired |date=2009-06-12 |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> Miyamoto initially hinted that the game might utilize the "Super Guide" feature, introduced in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.

As with the original ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'' features a musical score written for and performed by a [[symphony orchestra]]. Early in the development process, when the concept of "Super Mario Galaxy 1.5" was being considered, there were no plans to use different music from the first ''Super Mario Galaxy''. However, as the game evolved, the sound team, headed by Mahito Yokota, realized they needed new music that fit with the new gameplay mechanics that were being added. Although they were hesitant to use a symphony orchestra again because of recording difficulties, general producer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] gave permission immediately - according to Yokota, Miyamoto felt that players would be expecting an orchestral soundtrack. Miyamoto also apparently suggested that players would want to hear arrangements from ''Super Mario Galaxy'', which is why the soundtrack is a mixture of brand new pieces and arrangements of themes from the original ''Galaxy'' as well as many past installments in the ''[[Mario (series)|Mario]]'' series, such as ''[[Super Mario World]]'' and ''[[Super Mario 64]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gantayat |first=Anoop |date=2010-05-26 |url=http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2010/05/26/iwata_asks_mario_music/ |title=Iwata Asks Koji Kondo About Super Mario Galaxy 2's Music| accessdate=2011-07-15}}</ref> Ryo Nagamatsu, who worked previously on ''[[Wii Sports Resort]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros.

Nintendo composer [[Koji Kondo]] recruited 60 musicians for the orchestra, ten more than the number of musicians used for the original game's score, with an additional 10 musicians providing a big band style of music with trumpets, trombones, saxophones and drums for a grand total of 70 players. The orchestral performances were conducted by Taizo Takemoto, renowned for his work on the [[Super Smash Bros. (series)|Smash Bros. Concert]] in 2002, while Kondo served as an advisor and supervisor, and contributed five pieces to the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web|last=East |first=Thomas |date=2010-05-26 |url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/article.php?id=17417 |title=Mario Galaxy 2: Koji Kondo reveals soundtrack details |publisher=Official Nintendo Magazine |accessdate=2010-05-26}}</ref>

The soundtrack is currently available on a 2-disc set to members of the Japanese [[Club Nintendo]] as a reward. It can be acquired at the cost of 500 Star Points, though members who register a product code after purchasing ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'' can obtain it for 300 Star Points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://club.nintendo.jp/member/exec/index |title=Super Mario Galaxy 2 Original Soundtrack - Club Nintendo Japan |publisher=Club Nintendo |accessdate=2010-05-26}}</ref>

[[Giant Bomb]] editor Ryan Davis particularly praised the improved level designs, commenting that the designers were "bolder" and "more willing to take some weird risks with the planetoids and abstract platforming that set the tone in the original Galaxy",<ref>{{cite web |last=Davis |first=Ryan |title = Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review| publisher = [[Giant Bomb]] | date = 2010-05-21| url = http://www.giantbomb.com/super-mario-galaxy-2/61-26839/reviews/| accessdate = 2010-05-22}}</ref> while [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']]'s Chris Kohler commented that the level concepts alone "could be made into full games on their own."<ref>{{cite web| last = Kohler| first = Chris| title = Review: Brilliant Super Mario Galaxy 2 Is Full of Surprises| work = [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']]| date = 2010-05-21| url = http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2010/05/super-mario-galaxy-2-review/| accessdate = 2010-05-22}}</ref> Additionally [[1UP.com]] editor Justin Haywald noted the expanded soundtrack as "sweeping".<ref name="1uprev">{{cite web| last = Haywald| first = Justin| title = Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review for the Wii| publisher = [[1UP.com]]| date = 2010-05-21| url = http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3179424&p=44&sec=REVIEWS| accessdate = 2010-05-22}}</ref> [[GamesRadar]] praised the graphics, saying that despite the Wii's technical limitations, ''Galaxy 2'' "understands how to get the most out of aging technology that nearly all graphical flaws are smoothed over or covered up, leaving you with Wii's best-looking title to date".<ref name=GR /> [[X-Play]]'s Andrew Pfister awarded Super Mario Galaxy 2 a 5/5, calling it "the culmination of 20 years of Mario gaming into one fantastically-designed and creative platformer".<ref name="x-play">{{cite web| last = Pfister| first = Andrew| title = Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review| publisher = [[G4tv.com]]| date = 2010-05-21| url = http://g4tv.com/games/wii/61991/super-mario-galaxy-2/review/| accessdate = 2010-05-22}}</ref>

Despite this praise, some critics raised complaints over increased difficulty and the game's similarity to the original ''Super Mario Galaxy''. ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' editor Chris Scullion called it the "new best game on Wii", but said it lacked the original's impact (though they admitted the extreme difficulty of this, due to the quality of the original).<ref name="ONM">{{cite web| last = Scullion| first = Chris| title = Super Mario Galaxy 2 review| publisher = [[Official Nintendo Magazine]]| date = 2010-06-09| url = http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/17706/reviews/super-mario-galaxy-2-review-review/| accessdate = 2011-07-15}}</ref> [[Game Informer]] editor Matt Helgeson was concerned with some of the challenges being potentially "frustrating",<ref>{{cite web| last = Helgeson| first = Matt| title = Super Mario Galaxy 2| publisher = [[Game Informer]]| date = 2010-05-19| url =http://www.gameinformer.com/games/super_mario_galaxy_2/b/wii/archive/2010/05/19/mario-shines-in-epic-sequel.aspx|quote=Unfortunately, some other sequences that use the motion controller <U+2013> some flight levels that control with <U+201C>paper plane<U+201D> controls and a Super Monkey Ball-style level that uses the Wii remote like a joystick <U+2013> are imprecise and frustrating. |accessdate = 2010-05-22}}</ref> particularly towards the end of the game;<ref name="GameInfReview">{{cite web| last = Helgeson| first = Matt| title = Super Mario Galaxy 2: Mario Shines In Epic Sequel| publisher = [[Game Informer]]| date = 2010-05-19| url = http://gameinformer.com/games/super_mario_galaxy_2/b/wii/archive/2010/05/19/mario-shines-in-epic-sequel.aspx| accessdate = 2010-05-22}}</ref> similarly, [[GamePro]] editor Ben PerLee remarked that the "increased difficulty and high proficiency requirement may turn new fans off."<ref name="GPRO">{{cite web| last = PerLee| first = Ben| title = Super Mario Galaxy 2| work = | publisher = [[GamePro]]| date = 2010-05-21| url = http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/215237/super-mario-galaxy-2/| accessdate = 2010-05-22}}</ref> However, Worthplaying editor Chris DeAngelus said "perhaps most positively of all, there are very few sequences where death will feel like a result of bad design instead of player error, which helps keep the frustration down."<ref>{{cite web| last = DeAngelus| first = Chris| title = Wii Review - 'Super Mario Galaxy 2'| publisher = Worthplaying| date = 2010-05-21| url = http://worthplaying.com/article/2010/5/21/reviews/74413/| accessdate = 2010-05-22}}</ref>
