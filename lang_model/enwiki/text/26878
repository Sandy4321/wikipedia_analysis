'''K. Saraswathi Amma''' (1919<U+2013>1975)<ref>http://franke.uchicago.edu/AmritaPritam.pdf</ref><ref>http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OjZYf9Xf9bcC&pg=PA164&dq=k+saraswathi+amma&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Uv99Us2mE4STrgfHkICIBw&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=k%20saraswathi%20amma&f=false</ref> is a [[Malayalam]] feminist writer whose short stories have been anthologized in translation in several American texts. According to critic [[Jancy James]], <U+201C>In the entire history of women's writing in Kerala, Saraswathi Amma's is the most tragic case of the deliberate neglect of female genius.<U+201D>.<ref>http://samyukta.info/site/node/57</ref>

==Literary career==

K. Saraswathy Amma made her entry into the Malayalam literary scenario with a short story published in 1938, which was followed by 12 volumes of short stories, one novel, a play,and in 1958, a book of essays titled [[Purushanmarillatha Lokam]].<ref>http://samyukta.info/site/node/57</ref> In her time she was marginalized as a 'man hater'. But current feminist scholars have celebrated her as a genius.<ref>http://samyukta.info/site/node/57</ref><ref>http://ijg.sagepub.com/content/10/2/201.short</ref>

[[J. Devika]] in her article titled 'Beyond Kulina and Kulata: The Critique of Gender Difference in the Writings of K. Saraswati Amma', in [[Indian Journal of Gender Studies]] re-reads the writings of K. Saraswati Amma, whom she describes "an author marginalised within the Malayalee literary universe and labelled as an incorrigible man-hater." She considers her paper an "effort to read her writing as an engagement with the positions taken in the debates around modern gender in the early 20th-century Malayalee public sphere." <ref>http://ijg.sagepub.com/content/10/2/201.short</ref>

A selection of Saraswathi Amma's fiction, some of it translated into English were published in the name [[Stories from a forgotten feminist]].<ref>http://www.fishpond.com.au/Books/Stories-from-Forgotten-Feminist-Jancy-James-Introduction-by-K-Saraswaiti-Amma/9788185107622</ref><ref>http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Forgotten-Feminist-Saraswaiti-Amma/dp/8185107629/ref=sr_1_1/189-0870180-3462954?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1383982572&sr=1-1</ref> In the foreword by [[Jancy James]] she says "In  stories she shattered women's illusions about men and about love, and bitterly attacked patriarchy and tradition, giving her the reputation of being a strident feminist." <ref>http://www.fishpond.com.au/Books/Stories-from-Forgotten-Feminist-Jancy-James-Introduction-by-K-Saraswaiti-Amma/9788185107622</ref>
