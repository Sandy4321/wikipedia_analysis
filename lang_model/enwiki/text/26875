'''''Little Angels''''' is a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|Bafta]]-nominated<ref name="BAFTA_2005">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4345533.stm BBC News: Bafta TV Awards 2005: The winners]. Retrieved 26 September 2007</ref> British [[reality television]] show which ran for three series on [[BBC Three]] (2004<U+2013>2006). 

The series, in the [[docu-soap]] genre, aimed to show parents how to overcome common behavioural problems in their children, using a team of experts who observed and gave advice. The format of each programme involved experts monitoring the behaviour of the family and the children, before discussing with the parents the real underlying causes of the problem, which frequently involved the parents themselves. The experts then discussed a course of action with the parents, later coaching them on how to change their own and their children's behaviour to improve the situation. This was frequently achieved in scenes where the family was filmed in a communal activity, with the parents receiving advice from the attending professional via an ear piece. In addition to its entertainment value, ''Little Angels'' gave viewers strategies to deal with common problems, and offered real help to the family being filmed.
