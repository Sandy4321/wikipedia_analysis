'''Forth Valley Royal Hospital''' is a hospital located in [[Larbert]], [[Scotland]]. With 860&nbsp;inpatient beds, 25&nbsp;wards, and 16&nbsp;operating theatres, it is Scotland's largest ever NHS construction project. Built at a cost of <U+00A3>300&nbsp;million on the site of the old Royal Scottish National Hospital, it opened to its first patients in 2010. It is operated by [[NHS Forth Valley]].

The hospital is the first in Scotland to have a [[Forestry Commission Scotland|Forestry Commission]] ranger on site, whose job is to encourage the use of the {{convert|70|acre|adj=on}} grounds formerly belonging to the Larbert House estate. It has Scotland's first fully robotic pharmacy, in which robots dispense and label medicines. The hospital also employs robots to carry out tasks such as removing waste, delivering food to wards, and cleaning operating theatres.

==Background==

The Forth Valley Royal Hospital was designed by Equion, a subsidiary of Laing O'Rourke, and Keppie Designs<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ads.org.uk/designreview/reports/larbert-hospital | title=New Larbert Hospital Design | publisher=ADS.org | accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref> in cooperation with builders [[Laing O'Rourke]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.laingorourke.com/media/News/2009/Pages/FirstMinisterofScotlandtopsoutnewForthValleyHospital.aspx | title=First Minister of Scotland tops out new Forth Valley Hospital | publisher=laingorourke. | accessdate=22 July 2011}}{{dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref> After a consultation process in 2003, involving 5,600&nbsp;local residents,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nhsforthvalley.com/web/files/Publications_MiscStrategicPlans_files/fv_consultation.pdf | title=NHS Forth Valley Future | publisher=NHS Forth Valley | accessdate=4 August 2011}}{{dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref> it was decided that a new acute hospital should be built to replace the ageing facilities at Stirling Royal Infirmary and Falkirk Royal Infirmary, which were to become [[community hospital]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nhsforthvalley.com/home/Services/Hospitals/SCH/sri_faq.html | title=Q&A <U+2013> Stirling Community Hospital | publisher=NHS Forth Valley | accessdate=4 August 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The hospital, Scotland's largest ever NHS construction project,<ref name=serco/> cost <U+00A3>300&nbsp;million to build, most of which was provided by a [[private finance initiative]] arrangement;<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/in-favour-of-the-new-hospital-at-larbert-1.841107 | title=In favour of the new hospital at Larbert | publisher=Herald Scotland | date=12 February 2007 | accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref> it was built on the site of the old Royal Scottish National Hospital. Originally to be called Forth Valley Hospital, it was granted royal status by Queen [[Elizabeth II]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nhsforthvalley.com/ForthValleyRoyalHome/News&Publications/News_2010/fvr_news_jan2010_royalsealofapproval.html | title=Royal Seal of Approval | publisher=NHS Forth Valley | accessdate=22 July 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> becoming Forth Valley Royal Hospital. It was hoped the new hospital would be ready by 2009, but medical services did not start to be transferred until August 2010,<ref name=DailyRecord>{{cite web | url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health-news/2011/07/06/queen-opens-s300m-forth-valley-royal-hospital-86908-23251185/ | title=Queen opens <U+00A3>300m Forth Valley Hospital | publisher=Daily Record | date=6 July 2011 | accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> when the first patients were admitted.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-10837421 | title=New Forth Valley Royal Hospital opens to first patients |publisher=BBC  | work=BBC Scotland | date=2 August 2010 | accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> The process was completed in June 2011, and the queen officially opened the hospital on 6&nbsp;July 2011.<ref name=DailyRecord/>

For the use of staff, patients, and visitors the hospital has several catering establishments including [[Starbucks]], a [[Marks & Spencer]] Simply Food shop and cafe, and a full restaurant open seven days a week.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nhsforthvalley.com/ForthValleyRoyalHome/AbouttheHospital/fvr_about_facilities.html | title=Facilities at Forth Valley Royal | publisher=NHS Forth Valley | accessdate=3 August 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The hospital's design was criticised for not providing space for the storage of medical files. It was expected that all files would be stored electronically within five years. In the meantime, the paper medical files were transferred to the site of the old Falkirk Royal Infirmary. An old X-ray department at the hospital was decontaminated and converted into a storage department at a cost of <U+00A3>40,000, and a taxi company was contracted to move the records between sites.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2011/05/08/file-under-f-for-fiasco-as-taxis-are-used-to-ferry-documents-to-hospital-built-without-space-to-hold-them-86908-23116240/ | title=Taxis used to ferry documents to hospital built without space to hold them | publisher=Daily Record | accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref>

==Radio Royal==

Radio Royal is the hospital's in house radio station. It operates 24 hours a day seven days a week,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.radioroyal.org/ | title=Hospital Radio | publisher=Radio Royal.org | accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref> staffed by a team of around 27&nbsp;volunteers. Founded in 1976, it originally broadcast from the old Royal Scottish National Hospital in Larbert. It was latterly based at Falkirk Royal Infirmary, before returning to Larbert on the opening of Forth Valley Royal.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nhsforthvalley.com/ForthValleyRoyalHome/AbouttheHospital/fvr_radioroyal.html | title=Radio Royal | publisher=NHS Forth Valley | accessdate=4 August 2011}}{{dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref>

==Grounds==

The hospital is set in the grounds of the Old Larbert House estate, which until 2002 housed the Royal Scottish National Hospital, a state mental hospital. The 70 acres of land contain a loch, walled garden and woodland areas.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12140533 | title=Park ranger helps hospital patients enjoy local wildlife | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | work=BBC News | date=7 January 2011 | accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref> The grounds were transformed into a "green oasis" for the use of those using the hospital and the local community with the help of a <U+00A3>101,000 grant from the [[Forestry Commission Scotland]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/newsrele.nsf/WebPressReleases/1CEFB2F7CD011ECF802578AE00507981 | title=Hospital<U+2019>s woodlands set for makeover | publisher=Forestry Commission | date=14 June 2011 | accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-13762190 | title=Forth Valley Royal Hospital woods get <U+00A3>100k 'makeover' | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | work=BBC NEWS | date=14 June 2011 | accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref>  Forth Valley Royal is the first hospital in Scotland to have a Forestry Commission ranger on site.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nhsforthvalley.com/ForthValleyRoyalHome/News&Publications/News_2011/070111_hospital_ranger_first.html | title=Hospital Ranger First in Scotland | publisher=NHS Forth Valley | accessdate=4 August 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The ranger's job is to encourage use of the green space and promote healthy lifestyles.

The hospital was fitted with large windows to give patients access to views of the surrounding countryside. On clear days the Forth Bridges and the [[Lomond Hills|Lomond]] and [[Ochil Hills]] can be seen.

Tunnels were discovered during the hospital's construction, thought to have been built to allow wealthy guests staying at [[Larbert House]], built in 1822, to walk to the nearby loch unobserved.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-12717639 | title=Tunnel found in Forth Valley hospital grounds |publisher=BBC  | work=BBC Scotland | date=11 March 2011 | accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref>

==Transport==

The hospital is accessible by public transport via bus services operating from the main local towns.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nhsforthvalley.com/ForthValleyRoyalHome/AbouttheHospital/GettingtotheHospital/fvr_gettingtothehospital_bybus.html | title=Getting to the Hospital By Bus | publisher=NHS Forth Valley | accessdate=3 August 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.travelinescotland.com/stopfinder/searchForSMS.do?smsCode=32526924 | title=Forth Valley Royal Hospital | publisher=Traveline Scotland | accessdate=3 August 2011}}</ref> A shuttle bus used to but no longer runs every 20 minutes from [[Larbert railway station]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nhsforthvalley.com/ForthValleyRoyalHome/AbouttheHospital/GettingtotheHospital/fvr_gettingtothehospital_bytrain.html | title=Getting to the Hospital By Train | publisher=NHS Forth Valley | accessdate=3 August 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> (it was free for passengers with a train ticket); the station is thus now a 25 minute walk away from Larbert train station.<ref name = "Guide"/>

==Robotics==

Forth Valley Royal was the first hospital in the UK to use a system of robotic porters. A fleet of 13&nbsp;robotic vehicles operates with the hospital,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.news.com.au/robot-staff-plan-for-fiona-stanley-hospital/story-e6frg153-1225945557099 | title=Robot staff plan | publisher=News.com.au | date=30 October 2010 | accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref> supplied and maintained by services company [[Serco Group|Serco]], part of its 30-year contract to provide cleaning, catering, portering and maintenance services.<ref name=serco>{{cite web | title=Serco begins operating at the 'hi-tech' Forth Valley Royal Hospital | date=2 August 2010 | url=http://www.serco.com/media/pressreleases/2010/forthvalleyrobots.asp | publisher=Serco | accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref> The robots have their own corridor system and lifts underneath the hospital, and navigate using guidance lasers. They can be called up to wards by staff using a portable computer, and are used for tasks such as removing waste, delivering food to wards, and cleaning operating theatres.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10344849 | title=Forth Valley Royal Hospital to use robot 'workers' |publisher=BBC  | work=BBC Scotland | date=18 June 2010 | accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> To avoid any risk of cross-contamination the fleet is divided into those robots performing "clean" tasks and those carrying out "dirty" tasks, each with their own network of corridors.<ref>{{cite web |title=Robots to do hospital's dirty work |url=http://tech.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=153817807 |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref>

The hospital also has Scotland's first fully robotic [[pharmacy]], where robots dispense and label medicines.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.communitypharmacyscotland.org.uk/news,_policy_and_publications/news/news_stories/scotlands_first_robotic_hospital_pharmacy_opens.asp | title=Scotland's First Robotic Hospital Pharmacy Opens | publisher=Community Pharmacy Scotland | accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> It is estimated that in reducing the number of errors and requiring less staff time the system, which cost <U+00A3>400,000 to install, has cut the hospital's drug bill by <U+00A3>700,000. Instead of completing prescription forms, staff on the wards order drugs via computer terminals.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bradford |first=Eleanor | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-11552610 | title=Hospital robots cut hospital pharmacy bill |publisher=BBC  | work=BBC Scotland | date=18 October 2010 | accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref>
