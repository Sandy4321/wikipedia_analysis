'''TG&Y''' was a [[five and dime]], or variety store, chain in the [[United States]]. The chain was named for its three founders:  Rawdon E. Tomlinson, Enoch L. "Les" Gosselin, and Raymond A. Young.  The initials were ordered according to the age of the three, with Tomlinson being the oldest.  Founded in 1935, the chain was headquartered in [[Oklahoma City]]. At its peak, there were more than 900 stores.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4182/is_20011203/ai_n10149798 Say goodbye to TG&Y | Journal Record, The (Oklahoma City) | Find Articles at BNET.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/T/TG001.html T.G.& Y.

It was acquired by [[McCrory Stores]] in [[1986]], when it had about 720 stores. 
Shortly after [[McCrory Stores|McCrory's]] purchased '''TG&Y''', that company cut over 8,000 employees and closed 205 stores, including 23 in its former home-state of [[Oklahoma]].<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-5367291.html 8,000 TG&Y EMPLOYEES TERMINATED BY MCCRORY / 2,000 CUT IN STATE SINCE PURCHASE - The Journal Record - HighBeam Research<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
It did business under the '''TG&Y Family Center''' and later '''TG&Y Dollar''' and '''Aim for the Best''' and '''Dollar-T''' names as well.  Toward the end of its successful years, the chain used the advertising slogan, "Your best buy is at TG&Y."

In 2001, the chain filed bankruptcy and eventually all stores were closed.
