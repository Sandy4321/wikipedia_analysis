The '''Rose Bowl''' is an outdoor athletic [[stadium]] in [[Pasadena, California]], U.S., in [[Los Angeles County]]. The stadium is the home field of the [[UCLA Bruins football]] team and the site of the annual [[college football]] [[bowl game]], the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]], held on New Year's Day. It hosted events during the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]] Olympics,<ref name="nhlsum" /> and was the venue for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final|Final]] and the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup]] [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final|Final]], as well as five [[Super Bowl]] games. From 1999 until 2014, the Rose Bowl served as one of four host stadiums for the national championship game in the [[Bowl Championship Series]]. Beginning with the 2014-15 season, the stadium will serve as one of six stadiums that will serve as semi-final game sites in the [[College Football Playoff]].<ref>Ralph D. Russo, [http://sports.yahoo.com/news/ap-source-college-football-playoff-203225831--ncaaf.html College Football Playoff to replace BCS], ''AP'' via ''Yahoo! Sports'', April 23, 2013</ref>

The natural grass playing field runs in a north<U+2013>south configuration and sits at an elevation of 825&nbsp;feet (251&nbsp;m) [[AMSL|above sea level]].<ref>[http://msrmaps.com/image.aspx?T=2&S=11&Z=11&X=981&Y=9451&W=3&qs=%7cPasadena%7cCA%7c Topographic map] from [[USGS]] via [[Microsoft Research Maps]]</ref>
At a capacity of 92,542,<ref name="History"/> the Rose Bowl is the 17th largest [[List of stadiums by capacity|stadium in the world]], and the 11th largest [[List of U.S. stadiums by capacity|stadium in the United States]] (as well as the 11th largest [[List of American football stadiums by capacity|American football stadium]] and [[List of NCAA Division I FBS football stadiums|NCAA stadium]]). The stadium is a [[National Historic Landmark]] and a California Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.<ref name="nhlsum" />

==History==
[[File:RoseBowl-construction1921.jpg|left|thumb|The Rose Bowl under construction in 1921; note the original horseshoe shape]]
The game now known as the Rose Bowl Game was played at [[Tournament Park]] until 1922. The [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses|Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association]], the game's organizer, realized that the temporary stands were inadequate for a crowd of more than 40,000, and sought to build a better, permanent stadium.

===Design===
The stadium was designed by architect [[Myron Hunt]] in 1921. His design was influenced by the [[Yale Bowl]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], which was built in 1913, opened in 1914. The [[Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County)|Arroyo Seco]] was selected as the location for the stadium. Originally built as a horseshoe, the stadium was expanded several times over the years. The southern stands were completed in 1928, making the stadium a complete bowl.

===Construction===
The Rose Bowl was under construction from 1921 to 1922. The nearby [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] also was under construction during this time and would be completed in May 1923 shortly before The Rose Bowl was completed.

===Dedication, October 1922===
The first game was a regular season contest on October 28, 1922 when [[California Golden Bears football|Cal]] defeated [[USC Trojans football|USC]] 12&ndash;0. This was the only loss for USC and California finished the season undefeated. California declined the invitation to the [[1923 Rose Bowl]] game and USC went in their place. The stadium was dedicated officially on January 1, 1923 when USC defeated [[1923 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] 14&ndash;3.

==="The Rose Bowl"===
The name of the stadium was alternatively "Tournament of Roses Stadium" or "Tournament of Roses Bowl", until being settled as "Rose Bowl" before the [[1923 Rose Bowl]] game,<ref>HUGE FLAGSTAFF FOR PASADENA. Enormous Steel Pole 122 and <U+00BD> Feet Long Will Stand in Rose Bowl. Los Angeles Times, December 10, 1922. MONDAY afternoon at 2 o'clock the new flagstaff of the Tournament of Roses stadium, now called the Rose Bowl, will be put in place with suitable ceremony under auspices of the Pasadena Lions Club, donor of the pole.</ref> in reference to the unusually named (at the time) [[Yale Bowl]].

===Seating===
The stadium seating has been reconfigured several times since its original construction in 1922. The South end was filled in to complete the bowl and more seats have been added. The original wooden benches were replaced by aluminum benches in 1969. All new grandstand and loge seats had been installed since 1971.<ref name="UCLA1989">{{Citation  | last = Dellins  | first = Marc | title = 1989 UCLA FOOTBALL MEDIA GUIDE | place = Los Angeles, CA | publisher = UCLA Sports Information Office | year = 1989 | chapter = The Rose Bowl  | page = 254  }}</ref> New red seat backs had been added on 22,000 seats prior to the [[1980 Rose Bowl]].<ref name="UCLA1989" /> A Rose Bowl improvement was conducted because of UCLA's 1982 move and the [[1984 Summer Olympics]]. This resulted in new seat backs for 50,000 seats.<ref name="UCLA1989" />

For many years, the Rose Bowl had the largest football stadium capacity in the United States, eventually being surpassed by [[Michigan Stadium]] (109,901).<ref>[http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/stadium/ The Michigan Stadium Story]</ref><ref>[http://www.mgoblue.com/facilities/article.aspx?id=28642 University of Michigan Official Athletics site] <U+2013> Michigan Stadium</ref> The Rose Bowl's maximum stated [[seating capacity]] was 104,091 from 1972 to 1997.<ref name="UCLA1989" /> Some of the seats closest to the field were never used during this time for UCLA regular season games, and were covered by tarps. Official capacity was lowered following the [[1998 Rose Bowl]]. Slightly different figures are given for the current capacity, for the lower level seats behind the team benches are not used for some events since the spectators can not see through the standing players or others on the field. UCLA reports the capacity at 91,136.<ref name ="UCLAROSEBOWL">''UCLA Football <U+2013> 2007 UCLA Football (Media Guide)''. UCLA Athletic Department (2007), page 165 (PDF copy available at www.uclabruins.com)</ref> The Tournament of Roses reports the capacity at 92,542.<ref name="ROSEBOWLHISTORY">[http://www.rosebowlstadium.com/RoseBowl_history.htm Rose Bowl Stadium] <U+2013> History of the Rose Bowl Stadium</ref> The [[2006 Rose Bowl]] game, which was also the BCS championship game, had a crowd of 93,986.<ref>[http://www.tournamentofroses.com/roseparade/paradefaqs.asp Tournament of Roses Parade FAQs]. The Rose Bowl Game is a contractual sellout. In 2006, attendance was 93,986.</ref> In the 2011 contest between TCU and Wisconsin, the listed attendance is 94,118.  As of 2008, the Rose Bowl is the 8th [[List of American football stadiums by capacity|largest football stadium]], and is still the largest stadium that hosts post-season bowl games.<ref>[http://www.rosebowlstadium.com/RoseBowl_history.htm Historic information on the Rose Bowl Stadium]</ref> For concerts held there, the Rose Bowl holds almost 60,000 people. The 2014 remodeling of the stadium will remove the lower "lettered row" seats on each side behind the players' benches and provide access in and out of the stadium for the lower sections of the Rose Bowl, restoring to its original design.

===Stadium renovations===

The press box was updated before the [[1962 Rose Bowl]] with an elevator and two rows. The cost was $356,000. The Press Box was refurbished for UCLA's move in 1982 and the 1984 Summer Olympics.<ref name="UCLA1989" /> In 2011 and 2012, the press box was undergoing renovation as part of the larger renovation originally budgeted at $152 million in 2010.<ref>Toby Zwikel, Noah Gold, Brian Robin, Brener Zwikel & Associates, Inc - [http://www.pasadenacal.com/pasadena-press-releases/248--pasadena-city-council-approves-152-million-renovation-of-iconic-rose-bowl-stadium.html Pasadena City Council approves $152 million renovation of iconic Rose Bowl] City of Pasadena, October 12, 2010</ref> Costs had increased to $170 million during construction.<ref name="LATIMES170">Piasecki, Joe - [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/09/renovation-costs-at-rose-bowl-now-estimated-at-170-million.html Renovation Costs at Rose Bowl now estimated at $170 million].

Because of the increased construction cost, items deferred for the future are additional new restrooms, the historic field hedge, new entry gate structures, and additional new concession stands. The stadium has started "The Brick Campaign" to help pay for some of the cost of the renovations.<ref>Rose Bowl America's Stadium, ''Los Angeles Times'' Advertising Supplement, August 29, 2012</ref> The Brick Campaign, when completed in 2014, will feature a large logo of the [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses]] and the donor bricks arranged by universities in front of the south main entrance to the stadium.

===Court of Champions===
The Court of Champions is located at the south end of the stadium. Rose Bowl Game records along with the names of the coaches and the MVP players,including Hayden Fry<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fry|first1=Hayden|url=wikipedia.org/hayden_fry/|website=wikipedia.org/hayden_fry/}}</ref> are shown on the plaques attached to the exterior wall. The Hall of Fame statue is also located at the Court of Champions. The 2014 renovation will allow more plaques to be placed on the wall for future games.

===Terry Donahue Pavilion===
The seven-story [[Terry Donahue]] Pavilion is named for former UCLA football head coach, who is the most successful coach in UCLA and Pac-12 history. It houses the press boxes, broadcast booths, premium seating, boxes and suites.

===''Sports Illustrated'' venue rankings===
In 1999, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' listed the Rose Bowl at number 20 in the Top 20 Venues of the Twentieth Century.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/centurys_best/news/1999/06/02/top_venues/ SI's Top 20 Venues of the 20th Century]. Sports Illustrated, June 7, 1999

==Football at the Rose Bowl==

===Rose Bowl Game===
{{Main|Rose Bowl Game}}
The Rose Bowl stadium is best known in the U.S. for its hosting of the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]], traditionally being the first postseason [[college football]] game of the new year. The game is played after the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] on New Year's Day, or, if January 1 is a Sunday, on the following Monday January 2. The stadium's name has given rise to the term "[[bowl game]]" for all postseason games, regardless of whether they are played in a bowl-shaped or "Bowl"-named stadium. The Rose Bowl Game is commonly referred to as "The Granddaddy of Them All" because of its stature as the oldest of all the bowl games. Since its opening, the Rose Bowl stadium has hosted the bowl game every year except the [[1942 Rose Bowl]], when the game was moved to [[Durham, North Carolina]], at the campus of [[Duke University]]. Duke, which played in the game on January 1, volunteered to host the contest because of security concerns on the West Coast in the weeks following the attack on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]].<ref name="rose">{{cite web|url=http://www.sports-venue.info/NCAAF/Bowls/T_Rose_Bowl_Timeline.html|title=Rose Bowl Timeline|publisher=Pasadena Tournament of Roses|accessdate=2007-11-05}}</ref><ref>Zimmerman, Paul - Scene of Rose Bowl Shifted to Durham, N.C.

In 1998, the Rose Bowl Game became part of the [[Bowl Championship Series]]. The [[2002 Rose Bowl]] and the [[2006 Rose Bowl]] games also were the BCS Championship games, matching the #1 and #2 Bowl Championship Series teams in the nation. The [[2010 BCS National Championship Game]] was played 6 days after the [[2010 Rose Bowl Game]] as a completely separate event from the Tournament of Roses. The Tournament of Roses managed the event. The stadium hosted the [[2014 BCS National Championship Game]] when it celebrated its 100th anniversary of the Rose Bowl game.<ref>Beth Harris, [http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9IUVIE00.htm Vizio to be new Rose Bowl sponsor], ''AP'' via  ''BusinessWeek'', October 19, 2010</ref>

===UCLA Bruins football home stadium===
{{Main|UCLA Bruins football}}
[[File:UCLA Rose Bowl record.jpg|thumb|Previous edition of Rose Bowl records at Hall of Champions]]
The Rose Bowl stadium has been the home football field for [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] since [[1982 NCAA Division I-A football season|1982]].<ref name="UCLAROSEBOWL" /> The UCLA Bruins had played their home games at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] since [[1928 college football season|1928]]. There was an attempt to build a 44,000 seat stadium on campus, at the site where [[Drake Stadium (UCLA)|Drake Stadium]] eventually was built. However, the proposal was blocked by influential area residents, as well as other politicians.<ref name="STADIUMSCUTTLED">Crowe, Jerry - [http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-crowe16-2009nov16,0,1062188.column There goes the neighborhood: How UCLA stadium bid was scuttled.] Los Angeles Times, November 16, 2009</ref><ref>Reich, Ken - Stadium for UCLA Given Support - Architect's Study Cites Project as 'Desirable' STADIUM SUPPORT. Los Angeles Times, November 18, 1965. ''UCLA officials--still reportedly trying to decide whether to recommend the building of a 44,000-seat football stadium on campus--have released details of an architectural feasibility study.''</ref>

At the start of the [[1982 NFL season]], with the [[Oakland Raiders]] scheduled to move in, UCLA decided to relocate its home games to the Rose Bowl Stadium.<ref>[http://www.uclahistoryproject.ucla.edu/Fun/ThisMonth_AugRosebowl.asp UCLA History Project - This Month in History Aug. 18, 1982 <U+2026> A gridiron home] <U+2013> includes a photograph of the 1983 Rose Bowl game from an overhead shot</ref> The Bruins went on to play two straight Rose Bowl games in their new home stadium, the [[1983 Rose Bowl]] and the [[1984 Rose Bowl]]. UCLA has participated in five Rose Bowl games since moving to the stadium. The stadium is the host of the [[UCLA<U+2013>USC rivalry]] football game on even numbered years, alternating with the Coliseum. In the first rivalry game at the stadium between UCLA and USC in 1982, USC fans sat on the west side of the stadium and UCLA fans sat on the east side of the stadium, mirroring an arrangement that existed when the teams shared the Coliseum. Both teams also wore their home uniforms. In 1984, USC fans were moved to the end zone seats, which ended the tradition of shared stadium. Because of the shared arrangement, and the participation of USC in a number of Rose Bowl games, both schools have winning records in each other's home stadium. The Bruins travel 26 miles from campus to Pasadena to play home games, but only 14 miles to their biggest road game at USC every other year.<ref name="STADIUMSCUTTLED" />

===Caltech Beavers football home stadium===
[[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], a university located in Pasadena, played most home games in the Rose Bowl from the time of its construction until the school dropped football in [[1993 in sports|1993]]. Caltech jovially claimed to play before the greatest number of empty seats in the nation.<ref>The Discovery of Anti-Matter: The autobiography of [[Carl David Anderson]], The Youngest Man To Win the [[Nobel Prize]]. Published 1999 by World Scientific (ISBN 981-02-3680-8)</ref>

===Junior Rose Bowl===
The stadium hosted the '''Junior Rose Bowl''' from 1946 to 1971 and 1976 to 1977. Between 1946 and 1966 and 1976and 1977, the game pitted the [[California Community College Athletic Association|California Junior College]] football champions against the [[National Junior College Athletic Association|NJCAA]] football champions for the National Championship. It was organized by the Pasadena Junior Chamber of Commerce. The Junior Rose Bowl became the [[Pasadena Bowl]] from 1967 to 1971; it was billed as the Junior Rose Bowl the first two years, but instead two teams from the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] College Division competed (then later the University Division, usually featuring teams that were not invited to other major bowls).

===Super Bowls===
{{Main|Super Bowl}}
The stadium has hosted the [[Super Bowl]] five times. The first being in 1977, [[Super Bowl XI]] when the [[1976 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] beat the [[1976 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] 32&ndash;14. The game was also played there in 1980 ([[Super Bowl XIV]]), 1983 ([[Super Bowl XVII]]), 1987 ([[Super Bowl XXI]]) and 1993 ([[Super Bowl XXVII]]). The Rose Bowl is one of two venues ([[Stanford Stadium]] being the other) to host a Super Bowl though having never served as the full-time home stadium for an NFL or AFL team (Stanford Stadium hosted one [[San Francisco 49ers]] game after the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]]).

Because the NFL has a policy limiting the hosting of a Super Bowl to metropolitan areas with NFL teams, the Super Bowl has not been played at the Rose Bowl since the [[St. Louis Rams|Rams]] and [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]] departed the L.A. area in 1995.

==Soccer at the Rose Bowl==
The Rose Bowl has hosted matches for several high profile soccer tournaments, most notably the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup]], and the 1984 Summer Olympics. The Rose Bowl was also the home venue of the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] from 1996 to 2002.

The Rose Bowl is the largest stadium in the United States that hosts soccer matches from time to time.<ref>[[List of soccer stadiums in the United States]]</ref> The Rose Bowl has drawn soccer crowds exceeding 92,000 fans eleven times since 1984.<ref name="ussoccer.com">U.S. Soccer Attendance Records, Largest Crowds in the United States, http://www.ussoccer.com/teams/us-men/records/attendance-records/largest-crowds-in-us.aspx</ref>
The [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national soccer team]] plays games in the Rose Bowl occasionally. 
The [[Mexico national football team|Mexican national football team]], which has a large following in Los Angeles, has hosted several friendly matches at the Rose Bowl. On March 3, 2010, Mexico hosted [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] in a tune-up match for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] before a crowd of 90,500. On June 25, 2011 the Rose Bowl hosted the [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] Championship match before 93,420 fans.<ref name="ussoccer.com" />
It is the only stadium in the world to have hosted an Olympic gold medal match and both the Men's and Women's FIFA World Cup Final. Additionally, the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] occasionally still plays games there, such as their August 1, 2009 match against [[FC Barcelona]] in front of 93,137 fans.

In the past it was also the home field of two [[North American Soccer League (1968<U+2013>84)|North American Soccer League]] teams, the [[Los Angeles Wolves]] in 1968 and the [[Los Angeles Aztecs]] in 1978 and 1979.

===Major global soccer tournaments ===
The Rose Bowl has hosted a plethora of major soccer tournaments.

The Rose Bowl is one of two stadiums to have hosted the [[FIFA World Cup]] finals for both men and women. The Rose Bowl hosted the men's final in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] and the women's final in the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup]]. (The only other stadium with this honor is the [[R<U+00E5>sunda Stadium]] near [[Stockholm]], Sweden, which hosted the men's final in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] and the women's final in [[1995 FIFA Women's World Cup|1995]].)

The stadium hosted the 2007 [[Drum Corps International]] World Championships August 7 through August 11, 2007. The Rose Bowl is the final stadium to host the championship before DCI moved their corporate offices to [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]] with the championships being held at [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] until at least 2018. This was the first time the DCI championships have ever been held west of [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] in the 35&nbsp;year history of DCI.

It hosted auditions for the top American television show, ''[[American Idol]]'', on August 8, 2006. The stadium has also been used as part of the music video shoot for the song "[[The Last Song (The All-American Rejects song)|The Last Song]]", the second single released by the American rock band [[The All-American Rejects]], which features the band performing the song in the middle of the stadium to an empty crowd.

===Other events===
The stadium also plays host to the annual 4 July Fireworks show since 1926. Since 2008, "Americafest" has featured "[[Drum Corps International]] (DCI), Marching Music's Major League, which presents 'five of the country's best Drum and Bugle Corps", and a "world-class fireworks show that will thrill and delight families from throughout Southern California".<ref>[http://www.rosebowlstadium.com/RoseBowl_Americafest.htm "Americafest 2008 at the Rose Bowl]</ref>

The stadium's Court of Champions was the site of a "Roadblock" from [[The Amazing Race 17|season 17]] of the CBS reality TV show ''[[The Amazing Race]]'' where teams had to help decorate three sections of the [[Tournament of Roses Parade themes|theme float]] for the 2011 New Year's Day [[Tournament of Roses Parade|Rose Parade]].

On November 1997 the [[International Churches of Christ]] (Los Angeles) gathered at the Rose Bowl for their Worship Service, they had an attendance of 17,000.<ref>http://www.kipmckean.com/#_Toc185599053</ref>

The Rose Bowl and adjacent golf course are managed by the Rose Bowl Operating Company, a non-profit organization whose board is selected by council members of the City of Pasadena. UCLA and the Pasadena Tournament of Roses also have one member on the company board. The Rose Bowl stadium itself runs on a yearly operational loss.<ref name="e1">Greg Johnson, [http://www.latimes.com/sports/college/usc/la-sp-bowlfixes1jan01,1,322325,full.story?coll=la-headlines-sports-coll-usc $300-million fixer-upper], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 1, 2007.</ref> While it generates funds with the annual lease with UCLA ($1.5m), the [[Tournament of Roses]] ($900k), and a regularly hosted flea market ($900k), it makes up the loss by relying on funds generated by the adjacent city-owned [[Brookside Golf Course|golf course]] ($2m).<ref name="e1" /> While the stadium is able to keep operating in this financial set-up, it is unable to finance many of the capital improvements it needs to be considered a modern facility, including new seats, wider aisles, additional exits, a wider concourse, a renovated press box, a state-of-the-art video [[scoreboard]], new field lighting, additional suites and a club. The estimated cost for such improvements ranges from $250&nbsp;million and $300&nbsp;million.<ref name="e1" />

The stadium currently has long-term leases with its two major tenants, the [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses]] (2019) and UCLA (2023). In 2006, the Rose Bowl and the City of Pasadena launched a $16.3&nbsp;million capital improvement program that will benefit both UCLA and the Tournament of Roses. New locker rooms for both UCLA and visiting teams, as well as a new media interview area were constructed.<ref name="UCLAROSEBOWL" />

In April 2009, The Rose Bowl Operating Company unveiled a Rose Bowl Strategic Plan, which addressed the objectives to improve public safety; enhance fan experience; maintain national historic landmark status; develop revenue sources to fund long-term improvements; and enhance facility operations. On October 11, 2010, the Pasadena City Council approved a $152 million financing plan for the major renovation of the stadium. Groundbreaking ceremonies for the first of three phases of the project was held on January 25, 2011. The newly constructed video board was used for the June 25, [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup Final]].

===NFL===
{{Main|History of the National Football League in Los Angeles}}
Since losing both its local teams in the L.A. market in 1995, the [[National Football League]] had been looking to either start or relocate a franchise to the L.A. area. One of the strong candidates was a renovated Rose Bowl. However, after many years of varying offers, no deal could be struck between the NFL owners, the stadium's owner, and the City of Pasadena, following a vote of disapproval by its residents in November 2006.<ref name="e1" />

On November 19, 2012, Pasadena officials approved a proposal which could allow an NFL team to temporarily play in the Rose Bowl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pasadenasun.com/the626now/pasadenasu-20121120,0,1610674.story |title=Pasadena OKs plan that may bring NFL team to the Rose Bowl  |publisher=Pasadena Sun |date=2012-11-20 |accessdate=2011-11-25 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.pasadena.ca.us/Rose_Bowl_EIR/ |title=Temporary Use of the Rose Bowl Stadium by the National Football League  |publisher=City of Pasadena |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2011-11-25 }}</ref>
