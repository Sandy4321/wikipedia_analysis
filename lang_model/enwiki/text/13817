The earliest date at which [[Jew]]s arrived in [[Scotland]] is not known. It is possible that some arrived, or at least visited, as a result of the [[Roman Empire]]'s conquest of southern Great Britain, but there is no direct evidence for this. What the Romans referred to as "[[Caledonia]]" was never integrated into the Empire, although there was a short-lived occupation of southern Scotland, but Roman influence and trade continued after the withdrawal of their troops. Most histories of Jews in Scotland deal with the subject matter from a British perspective, and the Scottish aspect tends to be marginalised.

The vast majority of Scottish Jews are [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] with many from [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuania]].

==Middle Ages to Union with England==
{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}
While [[England]] during the [[Middle Ages]] had state persecution of the Jews, culminating in the [[Edict of Expulsion]] of 1290 (it has been suggested that Jews may have arrived in Scotland after this date [http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-2800-7], there was never a corresponding expulsion from Scotland. Indeed the eminent Jewish-Scottish scholar [[David Daiches]] states in his autobiographical ''Two Worlds: An Edinburgh Jewish Childhood'' that there are grounds for saying that Scotland is the only European country which has no history of state persecution of Jews. Evidence of Jews in medieval Scotland is fairly scanty, but in 1190, the Bishop of Glasgow forbade churchmen to "ledge their benefices for money borrowed from Jews".<ref>{{cite web |publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary|title=Scotland|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Scotland.html}}</ref>This was around the time of the Anti-Jewish riots in England so it is possible Jewish refugees lived in Scotland for a brief time, or it may refer to English Jews' interests in Scotland. [[Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee]] had close links to [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] ports such as in [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] known as [[Scotland|Scottish]] merchant trade routes. It is possible that [[Jewish]] people may have come to [[Scotland]] to trade with their [[Scotland|Scottish]] counterparts<ref>{{cite web |publisher=electricscotland.com|title=History|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/poland/scotsndx.htm}}</ref>

Like many [[Christianity|Christian]] nations, medieval Scots believed themselves to have a Biblical connection. The [[Declaration of Arbroath]] ([[6 April]] [[1320]]), which was sent as an appeal to [[Pope John XXII]], confirmed Scotland's status as an independent, sovereign state and asserted its right to use military action when considered unjustly attacked. It was sealed by fifty-one magnates and nobles. It is still periodically referenced by [[British Israelism|British Israelitists]]. The text asserts that in the eyes of God:

:''cum non sit Pondus nec distinccio Judei et Greci, Scoti aut Anglici''
:("there is neither bias nor difference between Jew or Greek, Scot or English")

The [[Stone of Scone|Stone of Destiny]] (Lia F<U+00E1>il) is also supposed to be the pillow stone said to have been used by the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Jacob]].

The first recorded Jew in [[Edinburgh]] was one [[David Brown (Scottish Jew)|David Brown]] in 1691, shortly before the Union [http://www.ehcong.com/JewishHistory.htm], who made an application to reside and trade in the city.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=ehcong.com|title=Jewish history|url=http://www.ehcong.com/JewishHistory.htm}}</ref>

==Post-Union==

The majority of Jewish immigration appears to have occurred post-industrialisation, and post-[[1707]], meaning that Jews in Scotland were subject to various anti-Jewish British laws. [[Oliver Cromwell]] readmitted Jews to England, [[Cornwall]] and [[Wales]] in 1656, and would have had some influence over the Scottish situation. Scotland was under the jurisdiction of the [[Jew Bill of 1753|Jew Bill]], enacted in 1753, but repealed the next year. 

The first graduate from the [[University of Glasgow]] who was openly-known to be Jewish was Levi Myers, in 1787. Unlike their English contemporaries, Scottish students were not required to take a religious oath. 

In 1795, we learn of Herman Lyon, who bought a burial plot in Edinburgh. He was of [[Germany|German]] nationality originally, and was a [[dentist]] and [[chiropody|chiropodist]]. He had moved to Scotland in 1788. There is no trace of the burial plot on [[Calton Hill]] today, but it is marked on the Ordnance Survey map of 1852 as "Jew's [[burial vault (tomb)|Burial vault]]".<ref>{{cite web |publisher=ehcong.com|title=Jewish history|url=http://www.ehcong.com/JewishHistory.htm}}</ref>

The first Jewish congregation in Edinburgh was founded in 1816, and in Glasgow in 1823.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=sefarad.org|title=Glascow|url=http://www.sefarad.org/publication/lm/022/glasgow.html}}</ref> That of [[Aberdeen]] was founded in 1893. The Jewish [[cemetery]] in [[Dundee]] indicates that there has been a Jewish congregation in that city since the 19th century.

Glasgow-born [[Asher Asher]] (1837&ndash;1889) was the first Scottish Jew to enter the medical profession. The only book he published was ''The Jewish Rite of Circumcision'' (1873).

By 1878, Jews became attached to the Scottish aristocracy when [[Hannah Primrose, Countess of Rosebery]], one of the [[Rothschilds]], born in England, married [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]]. She died at [[Dalmeny]].  Her son, [[Harry Primrose, 6th Earl of Rosebery|Harry]], would become [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] in 1945 for a year.

In order to avoid persecution in the [[Russian Empire]], Jews settled in the larger cities of the UK, including Scotland, most notably in [[Glasgow]] (especially the [[Gorbals]]), although there were smaller populations in [[Edinburgh]] and to a lesser extent, [[Dundee]], [[Aberdeen]], [[Greenock]] and [[Ayr]]. The Russian Jews tended to come from the west of the empire, especially the Baltic countries, and in particular [[Lithuania]]. It has been suggested that the Gorbals had a Jewish population of between 10,000 to 20,000, many decades ago although this has not been verified.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=theglasgowstory.com|title=Glasgow story|url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story.php?id=TGSDC10}}</ref>

==20th and 21st centuries==
[[Image:Garnethill synagogue.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Garnethill Synagogue in Glasgow]]

Immigration continued into the 20th century, with over 8,000 Jews in 1905<ref>{{cite web |publisher=jewishencyclopedia|title=Scotland|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=403&letter=S&search=scotland}}</ref> The Scottish Jewish community was augmented in the mid-20th century by refugees from [[Nazism]] and the [[Second World War]]. However some estimates were as high as 80,000 [http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/English/Home/About/Press+Room/Jewish+Agency+In+The+News/2006/4/aug20nsc.htm], it is important to remember that at its peak the Jewish population for United Kingdom all peaked at 500,000 but has almost declined half that number today[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7411877.stm].

Organised British anti-Semitism arose in the form of [[British Union of Fascists]], which met with limited success in Scotland. [[Oswald Mosley]] did visit Scotland, but his group was physically attacked on Princes Street in Edinburgh by "Protestant Action", which believed his group to be an [[Italy|Italian]] (i.e. [[Roman Catholic]]) intrusion. In fact, it has been claimed that bigotry was diverted away from Jews by anti-Catholicism, particularly in Glasgow, where the main racist and religious prejudice was against Irish people.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=sundayherald|title=Prejudice|url=http://www.sundayherald.com/45344}}</ref> The Englishness of many "British" hard-right movements also most-likely alienated many Scots who could have been potential converts. Perhaps the most prominent and vocal supporter of anti-Semitism was the eccentric aristocrat [[Archibald Maule Ramsay]], but it is difficult to link him with any large Scottish tendency. In the Gorbals at least, both Louise Sless and Woolf Silver, recall no anti-Semitic sentiment.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=sefarad.org|title=Glasgow|url=http://www.sefarad.org/publication/lm/022/glasgow.html}}</ref>  

According to the 2001 census, approximately 6,400 Jews live in Scotland, most of whom are in Edinburgh (about 1,000), Glasgow (about 5,000) and to a lesser extent Dundee. Scotland's Jewish population continues to be predominantly urban. The [[SSPCA]] came into conflict with the Aberdeen congregation over [[kosher|slaughtering methods]] at the turn of the 20th century. As with Christianity, the practising Jewish population continues to fall, as many younger Jews either become secular, or intermarry with other faiths. Scottish Jews have also emigrated in large numbers to the [[USA]], [[England]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] for economic reasons, as other Scots have done. Only a handful have moved to [[Israel]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Scotland currently has a strong Palestinian Solidarity campaign, led by the likes of [[George Galloway]], which sometimes is the cause of some friction with Scottish Jews, particularly over fund-raising by the [[Jewish National Fund]] in the country.

In August 2006, protests against the invasion of [[Lebanon]] by [[Israel]] led to their amateur [[cricket]] team having to play behind [[barbed wire]] at [[RAF Lossiemouth]].

In 2008, a [[Jewish tartan]] was designed and approved by the [[Scottish Tartans Authority]].<ref name="forw">[http://www.forward.com/articles/13787/ Schwartzapfel, Beth. "Sound the Bagpipes: Scots Design Jewish Tartan"]. Forward, July 17, 2008.</ref>

=="Scots-Yiddish"==
Scots Yiddish is the name given to a [[Jew]]ish hybrid vernacular between [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]] and [[Yiddish]] which had a brief currency in the Lowlands of [[Scotland]] in the first half of the 20th century. The Scottish literary historian [[David Daiches]] describes it in his autobiographical account of his Edinburgh Jewish childhood, ''Two Worlds'':

:"Recently I received a letter from the son of the man who was stationmaster at one of the small railway stations where the earliest trebblers [Yiddish pronunciation of travellers, i.e. Jewish travelling salesmen] would alight; he told me how, at the very beginning of this century, these Jewish immigrants, not yet knowing any English, would converse with his father, they talking in Yiddish and he in broad Scots, with perfectly adequate mutual intelligibility. Scots-Yiddish as a working language must have been developing rapidly in the years immediately preceding the first World War. It must have been one of the most short-lived languages in the world. I should guess that 1912 to 1914 was the period of its flourishing. The younger generation, who grew up in the 1920s and 1930s, of course did not speak it, though they knew Yiddish; and while there is an occasional old man in Edinburgh who speaks it today, one has to seek it out in order to find it, and in another decade it will be gone for ever. <U+2018>Aye man, ich hob<U+2019> getrebbelt mit de five o<U+2019>clock train,<U+2019> one trebbler would say to another. <U+2018>Vot time<U+2019>s yer barmitzvie, laddie?<U+2019> I was once asked. <U+2018>Ye<U+2019>ll hae a drap o<U+2019> bamfen (whisky). It<U+2019>s Dzon Beck. Ye ken: <U+201C>Nem a schmeck fun Dzon Beck.<U+201D><U+2019>  (<U+2018>Take a peg of John Begg<U+2019>, the advertising slogan of [[John Begg]] whisky.)<ref>David Daiches, ''Two Worlds'', 1956, Cannnongate edition 1987, ISBN 0-86241-148-3, p. 119f.</ref>
Daiches explores the social stratification of Edinburgh Jewish society in the interwar period, noting what is effectively a class divide between two parts of the community, on the one hand a highly educated and well-integrated group who sought a synthesis of Orthodox Rabbinical and Modern Secular thinking, on the other a Yiddish-speaking group most comfortable maintaining the lifestyle of the Eastern European ghetto. The Yiddish population grew up in Scotland in the 19th century, but by the late 20th century had mostly switched to using English. The [[creole language|creolisation]] of [[Yiddish]] with [[Scots language|Scots]] was therefore a phenomenon of the middle part of this period.

The [[Glasgow|Glaswegian]] Jewish poet [[A. C. Jacobs]] also refers to his language as Scots-Yiddish.<ref>Mario Relich, "The Strange Case of A. C. Jacobs" [http://www.star.ac.uk/darkhorse/archive/RelichOnA_C_Jacobs.pdf online].</ref> There was even a case of a Jewish immigrant who settled in the [[Highlands]] who spoke no English and was only able to speak [[Gaelic]] and [[Yiddish]].
