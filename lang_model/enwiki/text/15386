The '''Brazilian monitor ''Cear<U+00E1>''''' was the fifth ship of the {{sclass|Par<U+00E1>|monitor|0}} river [[monitor (warship)|monitor]]s built for the [[Brazilian Navy]] during the [[War of the Triple Alliance]] in the late 1860s. ''Cear<U+00E1>'' arrived in Paraguay in mid-1868 and provided fire support for the army for the rest of the war. The ship was assigned to the [[Mato Grosso]] [[Flotilla]] after the war. ''Cear<U+00E1>'' was [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in 1884.

==Design and description==
The ''Par<U+00E1>''-class monitors were designed to meet the need of the [[Brazilian Navy]] for small, shallow-draft armoured ships capable of withstanding heavy fire. The monitor configuration was chosen as a turreted design did not have the same problems engaging enemy ships and fortifications as did the [[Central battery ship|central battery ironclads]] already in Brazilian service. The [[wikt:oblong|oblong]] [[gun turret]] sat on a circular platform that had a central pivot. It was rotated by four men via a system of gears; 2.25 minutes were required for a full 360<U+00B0> rotation. A bronze [[Naval ram|ram]] was fitted to these ships as well. The hull was sheathed with [[Muntz metal]] to reduce [[biofouling]].<ref name=g53>Gratz, p. 153</ref>

The ships measured {{convert|39|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|8.54|m|ftin|sp=us}}. They had a [[draft (ship)|draft]] between of {{convert|1.51|-|1.54|m|ftin|sp=us}} and displaced {{convert|500|t|LT|lk=on|sp=us}}.<ref name=g54/> With only {{convert|0.3|m|ftin|sp=us}} of [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] they had to be towed between Rio de Janeiro and their area of operations.<ref name=g53/> Their crew numbered 43 officers and men.<ref name=g54>Gratz, p. 154</ref>

===Propulsion===
The ''Par<U+00E1>''-class ships had two direct-acting [[marine steam engine|steam engines]], each driving a single {{convert|1.3|m|ftin|sp=us|adj=on}} propeller. Their engines were powered by two tubular [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s at a working pressure of {{convert|59|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The engines produced a total of {{convert|180|ihp|lk=on}} which gave the monitors a maximum speed of {{convert|8|kn|lk=on}} in calm waters. The ships carried enough coal for one day's steaming.<ref>Gratz, pp. 154<U+2013>56</ref>

===Armament===
''Cear<U+00E1>'' had a single [[120-pounder Whitworth naval gun|120-pounder Whitworth]] [[rifled muzzle loader]] (RML) in her gun turret. The gun had a maximum range of about {{convert|5540|m|yd|sp=us}}.<ref>Gratz, pp. 153<U+2013>54</ref> The {{convert|7|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} shell of the 120-pdr gun weighed {{convert|151|lb|kg|1}} while the gun itself weighed {{convert|16660|lb|kg|1}}.<ref>Holley, p. 34</ref> Most unusually the guns' Brazilian-designed iron [[gun carriage|carriage]] was designed to pivot vertically at the [[Muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]]; this was done to minimize the size of the [[Glossary_of_nautical_terms#G|gunport]] through which splinters and shells could enter.<ref>Gratz, p. 155</ref>

===Armor===
The hull of the ''Par<U+00E1>''-class ships was made from three layers of wood that alternated in orientation. It was {{convert|457|mm|in|sp=us|1}} thick and was capped with a {{convert|102|mm|in|sp=us|0|adj=on}} layer of [[Aspidosperma polyneuron|peroba hardwood]]. The ships had a complete [[wrought iron]] waterline [[Belt armor|belt]], {{convert|0.91|m|ft|sp=us|1}} high. It had a maximum thickness of 102&nbsp;millimetres amidships, decreasing to {{convert|76|mm|in|sp=us|0}} and {{convert|51|mm|in|sp=us|0}} at the ship's ends. The curved [[deck (ship)|deck]] was armored with {{convert|12.7|mm|in|sp=us|1}} of wrought iron.<ref name=g53/>

The gun turret was shaped like a [[rectangle]] with rounded corners. It was built much like the hull, but the front of the turret was protected by {{convert|152|mm|in|sp=us|0}} of armor, the sides by 102&nbsp;millimetres and the rear by 76&nbsp;millimetres. Its roof and the exposed portions of the platform it rested upon were protected by 12.7&nbsp;millimetres of armor. The armored [[pilothouse]] was positioned ahead of the turret.<ref name=g53/>

==Service==
''Cear<U+00E1>'' was laid down at the Arsenal de Marinha da C<U+00F4>rte in [[Rio de Janiero]] on 8 December 1866, during the [[War of the Triple Alliance]], which saw [[Argentina]] and Brazil allied against [[Paraguay]]. She was launched on 22 March 1868 and commissioned the following month. The monitor arrived in Paraguay in May 1868. On 31 August she bombarded enemy positions on the [[Tebicuary River]] to provide cover for advancing troops. The ship destroyed Paraguayan defenses on the [[Manduvir<U+00E1> River]] on 18 April 1869.<ref name=g9>Gratz, p. 157</ref> ''Cear<U+00E1>'', together with her [[sister ship]]s {{ship|Brazilian monitor|Piau<U+00ED>||2}} and {{ship|Brazilian monitor|Santa Catharina||2}}, broke through the Paraguayan defenses at Guaraio on 29 April and drove off the defenders.<ref>Donato, p. 300</ref> After the war she was assigned to the Mato Grosso Flotilla and was scrapped in 1884.<ref name=g9/>
