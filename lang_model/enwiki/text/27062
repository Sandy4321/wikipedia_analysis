'''Delaware State Park''' is a {{convert|2016|acre|adj=on}} [[List of Ohio state parks|Ohio state park]] in [[Delaware County, Ohio|Delaware County]], [[Ohio]] in the United States. The park, town and county are named for the [[Lenape|Delaware]] nation (also known as the Lenape), a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe that originally lived along the [[Delaware River]] in [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], [[New York]], [[Maryland]], [[Connecticut]] and [[New Jersey]]. The Lenape were forced west by colonial settlers and were eventually forced further west by settlers of the [[Northwest Territory]] from which Ohio was established in 1803. Delaware State Park is on [[U.S. Route 23]] near the city of [[Delaware, Ohio]]. It is open for year-round recreation including camping, hiking, boating, hunting, fishing, and picnicking.<ref name="dsp">{{cite web | url = http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/parks/tabid/729/Default.aspx | title = Delaware State Park | accessdate = 2009-01-09 | publisher = [[Ohio Department of Natural Resources]] Division of Parks and Recreation}}</ref>

==History==
The [[Lenape]] (later named Delaware Indians by Europeans) are organized bands of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] peoples with shared cultural and linguistic characteristics. Delaware State Park is named for them. It is just one of many places in the United States bearing the name "Delaware".<ref name="adams">{{cite book | last = Adams | first = Richard Calmit | year = 1909 | title = The Delaware Indians, a brief history | publisher = Government Printing Office | location = Washington, DC 1909}}</ref>

They lived in what is now [[New Jersey]] and along the [[Delaware River]] in [[Pennsylvania]], the northern shore of [[Delaware]], in the northeastern corner of [[Maryland]], the panhandle of [[Connecticut]] and the lower [[Hudson Valley]] and [[New York Harbor]] in [[New York]], at the time of the arrival of the [[European colonization of the Americas|Europeans]] in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.<ref name="adams"/> 

The [[Treaty of Easton]], signed between the Lenape and the English in 1766, removed them westward, out of present-day New York and New Jersey and into Western Pennsylvania and Ohio and beyond. The Lenape continually were crowded out by European settlers and pressed to move in several stages over a period of 176 years, with the main body arriving in the northeast region of [[Oklahoma]] in the 1860s. Along the way many smaller groups left, or were told to stay where they were, but not in Ohio. Consequently today, the Lenape are spread from [[New Jersey]] to [[Wisconsin]] to southwest [[Oklahoma]].<ref name="adams"/>

The Delaware did not leave Ohio without a fight. They joined a confederation of tribes lead by [[Chief Pontiac]] and participated in what became known as [[Pontiac's War]]. They also joined [[Blue Jacket]]'s confederation in the [[Northwest Indian War]].<ref name="dowd"> {{cite book | last = Dowd | first = Gregory Evans | title = A Spirited Resistance: The North American Indian Struggle for Unity, 1745-1815 | date = 1992 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University | location = Baltimore, Maryland}}</ref>

Anglo-American settlers moved into the area of Delaware State Park in the early 1800s. A wagon trail near what is now [[U.S. Route 23]] broght settlers to the area. A [[tavern]] was constructed along the trail in 1810 on a small hill that is now part of the park. A [[palisade]] was built around the tavern in anticipation of the [[War of 1812]]. The tavern and palisade came to be known as Fort Morrow. The fort was never attacked but it did provide a sense of security for the settlers of the area.<ref name="dsp"/>

Delaware State Park was established in 1952 following the completion of [[Delaware Lake]] by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] in 1951.<ref name="dsp"/> The lake was built as part of the [[Flood Control Act of 1938]]. The dam on the [[Olentangy River]] is part of the Corps' Huntindgon district and helps control flooding along the Olentangy, [[Scioto River|Scioto]] and [[Ohio River]]s. It was built between 1947 and 1951 at a cost of $4,307,000.<ref name="lake">{{cite web | url = http://www.lrh.usace.army.mil/_kd/go.cfm?destination=Page&Pge_ID=1214 | title = Delaware Lake | accessdate = 2009-01-10 | publisher = U.S. Army Corps of Engineers}}</ref>

==Ecology==
Delaware State Park is surrounded by [[farm]] land. Before the land was cleared for farming it was an [[old growth forest]] of [[beech]] and [[maple]]. The old forest was cut long ago, but a thriving [[second growth forest]] can be found in and around Delaware State Park. The woods provide habitat for [[White-tailed deer]], [[Fox Squirrel]]s, [[Groundhog]]s, and [[Pheasant]].<ref name="dsp"/>

==Recreation==
Delaware State Park is open for year-round recreation. Boats with unlimited horsepower are permitted on Delaware Lake which is also open to fishing and swimming in the designated swimming area. There is a marina that sells fuel as well as fishing and boating supplies. The lake is home to a variet of game fish including [[largemouth bass|largemouth]] and [[smallmouth bass]], [[crappie]], and[[muskellunge]]. [[Waterfowl]] hunting is permitted along the lake. Numerous [[duck blind]]s are awarded through a lottery system. Hunting for other game animals is permitted on the wildlife area. There are many picnic area on the shore of the lake with table available on a first come, first served basis.<ref name="dsp"/>
