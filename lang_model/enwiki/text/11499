'''The Junction''', is a neighbourhood in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], that is near the junction of four railway lines in the area known as the [[West Toronto Diamond]].  The neighbourhood was previously an independent village, town and city until amalgamating with Toronto in 1909.  The main intersection of the area is that of Dundas Street West and Keele Street. 

==History==
As with most Toronto neighbourhoods outside of the central downtown core, the area was primarily rural up until the 1870s.  Much of the area that is now the Junction once was the site of the Carleton Race Course from 1857-1876, which was owned by the Keele family.  The track was the site of the first [[Queen's Plate]]. Following the arrival of the railways in the 1880s, the old racetrack and surrounding area was developed by [[Daniel Webster Clendenan]]. The approximate locations of the two main straightaways of the track are now High Park Avenue and Pacific Avenue.

The Village of West Toronto Junction was founded in 1884 at the intersection of Dundas and Keele Streets.<ref name="origin">{{ cite web

}}</ref> In 1889, it merged with the nearby villages of Carleton and Davenport to the north to become the Town of West Toronto Junction. It grew further, into the Town of Toronto Junction in 1892, then the City of West Toronto in 1908 before it was annexed by the [[City of Toronto]] one year later in 1909.

The Junction was a manufacturing community that boomed during the late 1800s.  Foundries, mills, wire factories, and industries, such as [[CCM (cycle)|Canadian Cycle & Motor Co.]], [[Archibald Campbell (Canadian politician)|Campbell Milling Company]] and the [[Heintzman & Co.|Heintzman piano company]] began moving into the area.  Other firms came because land, labour and taxes were cheaper than in Toronto, and the [[Canadian Pacific]] established a major operation there, establishing yards from Keele Street as far west as Scarlett Road.  In addition, the town acquired an official port of entry in the 1890s, allowing local businesses to clear their goods locally as opposed to using the downtown Toronto port.  These factors also attracted many immigrant or second generation [[Irish Catholics]] to the area, many of whom moved there from then poor, crowded tenement housing in areas of the city such as [[Cabbagetown, Toronto|Cabbagetown]] and [[Brockton Village]] during the 1880s. Many also came from working-class English industrial cities such as Birmingham and Manchester. They were soon followed by many from non-English speaking countries, including [[Italian people|Italians]], [[Polish people|Poles]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] and [[Croatian people|Croatian]] immigrants, many of whom worked in the meat industry.

The Junction was prone to booms and busts during its tumultuous history; while the period between 1888 and 1890 was a prosperous one, the period between 1893 and 1900 saw significant poverty in the area due to an economic recession.  The [[Long Depression]] saw the closing of factories and the end to construction in the area, and the municipality could not support its citizens because of a large civic debt.

Pubs and taverns became permanent fixtures in The Junction, as was the case with many railway and factory workers' towns.  By 1903, alcohol was such a serious problem for families and a public embarrassment (as drunks were visible from passing trains), that a [[temperance movement]] grew in the area, lead by the strong [[Methodism|Methodist]] community.  The town voted to go dry in 1904, and continued to enforce [[local option]] as late as 2000, being at the time the last area of Toronto to ban the sale of alcohol.

Toronto annexed The Junction in 1909 and the two have gradually grown together, though residents have retained their community identity and remained very loyal to the neighbourhood, despite further economic hardship. The commercial stretch of Dundas Street went into decline, attributed at least partly to the prohibition. The [[prohibition]] law dissuaded restaurants from establishing themselves there, and bars were not permitted.

The area between [[Keele Street|Keele]], Runnymede Road, [[St. Clair Avenue|St. Clair]], and the CP railway lines, was for many decades the location of the Ontario Stockyards. For a time, this was Canada's largest livestock market and the centre of Ontario's [[meat packing industry]], and reinforced [[Name of Toronto#Nicknames|Toronto's nickname]] as [[William Davies Company|Hogtown]]. The Ontario Stockyards closed at this site in 1993 (moving to [[Cookstown, Ontario|Cookstown]], much further north of the city), and most of the meat-packing plants that surrounded it closed shortly thereafter. Much of the lands has been redeveloped with new housing and retail uses. The main Stockyards site is now the location of a large bloc of [[big-box stores]], including [[Metro Stores (Ontario)|Metro]], [[Home Depot]], [[Canadian Tire]], [[Future Shop]] and [[Rona (company)|Rona]], along with several smaller stores. There are still some smaller meat-packing facilities in the area and the name "Stockyards" is still used for the area.

Since the early 1920s, the area by Dundas and St. John's Road has been known as "Little [[Malta]]" (getting signs to that effect in the 1990s) with several Maltese-Canadian businesses present, as well as a distinctly Maltese church.  The Maltese-Canadian community has partially spread out to Mississauga and other Toronto suburbs, but still has a visible presence in this area.<ref name="little Malta">{{cite journal

As a consequence of the local [[abattoir]]s and other industries which produced volumes of toxic waste, the residents of the neighbourhood are highly concerned about pollution issues, and the city of Toronto has put significant efforts into cleaning up former industrial sites.

The elimination of prohibition has had a positive effect on the community, however. Rapid gentrification has meant new chic restaurants and bars have opened up along Dundas Street, attracting young [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]]s, while lower rents make the neighbourhood appealing to artists.  Some see The Junction as the next big "hip place to live" with a surplus of vacated industrial space and warehouse loft conversion possibilities.

Today, the term "Junction" is generally applied to the area north of Annette, south of the Canadian Pacific Railway corridor, and between Runnymede Road and the Canadian National Railway corridor to the east. Historically, the boundary lines cover a considerably larger area.<ref name=TrainwebJunction>

The City of West Toronto as annexed by Toronto in 1909 had a northern boundary well past St. Clair to Rowntree Avenue, an eastern boundary zig-zagging along the [[Canadian National]] tracks, a southern boundary of Bloor Street, and a western boundary as far as Jane Street in the southwest between Bloor and Annette [http://wtjhs.ca/jmap2.gif].  Since the 1920s{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, the commercial development on Bloor Street has caused the area between the Junction and [[Swansea, Toronto|Swansea]] to rise in prominence, and thus many current residents of the former Junction area identify more with [[Runnymede-Bloor West Village]].
