'''Polabian [[Slavs]]''' ({{lang-dsb|Po<U+0142>obske S<U+0142>owjany}}, {{lang-pl|S<U+0142>owianie po<U+0142>abscy}}, {{lang-cz|Polab<U+0161>t<U+00ED> Slovan<U+00E9>}}) is a collective term applied to a number of [[Lechites|Lechite]] tribes who lived along the [[Elbe]] river in [[East Germany]]. The approximate territory stretched between the [[Baltic Sea]] to the north, the [[Saale]]<ref>De Vere, 353</ref> and the ''[[Limes Saxoniae]]''<ref name="C18">Christiansen, 18</ref> to the west, the [[Ore Mountains]] and the [[Western Sudetes]] to the south, and [[History of Poland (966<U+2013>1385)|Poland]] to the east. They have also been known as '''Elbe Slavs'''<ref>Goldberg, 134</ref> ({{lang-de|Elbslawen}}) or '''[[Wends]]'''. Their name derives from the Slavic ''po'', meaning "by/next to/along", and the Slavic name for the Elbe (''Labe'' in Czech and <U+0141>aba in Polish).

The Polabian Slavs started settling in the territory of modern [[Germany]] in the second half of the first millennium. They were largely conquered by [[Saxons]] and [[Danish people|Danes]] during the 12th century and subsequently included within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The tribes were gradually [[Germanization|Germanized]] and assimilated in the following centuries; the [[Sorbs]] are the only descendants of the Polabian Slavs to have retained their identity and culture.

The [[Polabian language]] is now extinct. However, both [[Sorbian languages]] are spoken by approximately 60,000 inhabitants of the region and the languages are regarded by the government of Germany as official languages of the region.

The [[Bavarian Geographer]] anonymous medieval document compiled in [[Regensburg]] in 830 contains a list of the tribes in Central-Eastern Europe to the east of the Elbe. Among other tribes it lists the Uuilci ([[Veleti]])- with 95 [[Civitas|civitates]], the Nortabtrezi ([[Obotrites]]) - 53 civitates, the Milzane ([[Milceni]])-  30 civitates, and the Hehfeldi ([[Hevelli]])- 14 civitates.

The [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] classifies the Polabian Slavs in three main tribes, the [[Obotrites]], the [[Veleti]], and the [[Sorbs|Lusatian Sorbs]].

The main tribes<ref>Herrmann, 7</ref> of the Obotritic confederation were the [[Obotrites]] proper ([[Wismar Bay]] to the [[Schweriner See]]); the [[Wagrians]] (eastern [[Holstein]]); the [[Warnabi]] (''Warnower'') (the upper [[Warnow]] and [[Mildenitz]]); and the [[Polabians (tribe)|Polabians]] proper (between the [[Trave]] and the [[Elbe]]). Other tribes associated with the confederation include the Linones (''Linonen'') near [[Lenzen]], the Travnjane near the [[Trave]], and the [[Drevani]] in the [[L<U+00FC>chow-Dannenberg|Hanoverian Wendland]] and the northern [[Altmark]].<ref name="H8">Herrmann, 8</ref>

The [[Veleti]], also known as the Liutizians or Wilzians, included the [[Kessinians]] (''Kessiner'', ''Chyzzini'') along the lower Warnow and [[Rostock]]; the [[Circipani]] (''Zirzipanen'') between the [[Recknitz]], [[Trebel]], and [[Peene]] Rivers; the Tollenser east and south of the Peene along the [[Tollense]] River; and the Redarier south and east of the [[Tollensesee]] on the upper [[Havel]]. The Redarier were the most important of the Veleti tribes.<ref name="H8"/>

The [[Rani (tribe)|Rani]] of [[R<U+00FC>gen]], not to be confused with the older Germanic [[Rugians]], are sometimes considered to be part of the Veleti.<ref name="C27">Christiansen, 27</ref> South of the Rani were the [[Ucri]] (''Ukranen'') along the [[Ucker]] and the Morici (''Morizani'', ''M<U+00FC>ritzer'') along the [[M<U+00FC>ritz]];<ref name="H8"/> the former gave their name to the [[Uckermark]]. Smaller tribes included the Do<U+0161>ane along the [[Dosse]], the Zamzizi in the [[Ruppin Land]], and the R<U+011B><U+010D>anen on the upper [[Havel]]. Along the lower Havel and near the confluence of the Elbe and the Havel lived the Nel<U+011B>tici, the Liezizi, the Zemzizi, the Smeldingi (''Smeldinger''), and the Bethenici.<ref name="H8"/>

The middle [[Havel]] region and the [[Havelland]] were settled by the [[Hevelli]], a tribe loosely connected to the Veleti. East of the Hevelli lived the [[Sprevane]] of the lower [[Dahme (river)|Dahme]] and [[Spree]] rivers.<ref name="H8"/> Small tribes on the middle Elbe included the Moriciani, the Zerwisti, the Serimunt, and the Nicici.

South of the Hevelli lived the ancestors of the modern [[Sorbs]], the [[Lusatia|Lusici]] of [[Lower Lusatia]] and the [[Milceni]] of [[Upper Lusatia]]. Near these tribes were the Selpoli and the Besunzanen.<ref name="H8"/> The Colodici, Siusler, and Glomaci (''Daleminzier'') lived along the upper Elbe, while the Chutici, Nisanen, Plisni, Gera, Puonzowa, Tucharin, Weta, and groups of Nel<U+011B>tici lived near the Saale.<ref name="H9">Herrmann, 9</ref> On the middle [[Oder]] lived the Leubuzzi, who were associated with medieval Poland. Small groups of West Slavs also lived on the [[Main (river)|Main]] and the [[Regnitz]] near [[Bamberg]] and in northeastern [[Bavaria]].<ref name="H9"/>

===Princes===

A Polabian prince was known as a ''[[knes]]''. His power was relatively greater in Slavic society than those of Danish or Swedish kings in their kingdoms,{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} although it was not absolute. He was the general leader of his tribe and was foremost among its nobles, holding much of the forested [[hinterland]] and expecting reverence from his warriors.<ref name="C28"/> However, his authority largely extended only to the territory controlled by his governor, or ''[[voivot]]''. Each ''voivot'' governed small territories based around fortifications.

Princely power often differed between tribes. The Obotrite prince [[Henry (Obotrite prince)|Henry]] was able to maintain a sizable army ca. 1100 at the expense of the towns, and the importance of ''knes'' within the Obotrites only increased after his death.<ref name="C32">Christiansen, 32</ref> The prince of the [[Rani (tribe)|Rani]], on the other hand, was limited by the local [[senate]], which was led by the high priest at [[Cape Arkona]]; the Rani ''knes'' was essentially first among the tribe's landowners.<ref name="C33">Christiansen, 33</ref>

===Towns===

The power of the prince and his governors was often restricted by the river towns, known to [[chronicle]]rs as [[civitas|civitates]], especially within the territory of the Veleti. Polabian towns were centered on small [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]] arranged in circles or ovals.<ref name="C28"/> The ''[[Gord (Slavic settlement)|gord]]'' was situated at the highest altitude of the town and held a barracks, citadel, and princely residence. It was often protected by a moat, walls, and wooden towers. Below the ''gord'', but still within the town walls, was the ''urbs'' or ''[[suburb]]ium'', which held the residences for the nobility and merchants. The towns often held wooden temples for [[Slavic mythology|Slavic gods]] within the ''urbs''. Outside of the walls were homes for the peasantry.<ref name="C29">Christiansen, 29</ref> With the exception of [[Cape Arkona|Arkona]] on [[R<U+00FC>gen]], few Polabian towns on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic coast]] were built near the shore, out of concern for pirates and raiders. While not highly populated compared to [[Flanders]] or [[Italy]], the Polabian towns were relatively large for the Baltic region, such as in comparison to those of Scandinavia.<ref name="C32"/>

===Peasantry===

The majority of Polabian Slavs were [[peasant]]s in small villages who engaged in [[agriculture]]<ref>http://www.utlib.ee/ekollekt/diss/mag/2005/b17445875/kaljundi.pdf p. 85</ref> (rich in grains, flax) and [[animal husbandry]] (poultry, cattle).<ref name="C27"/> Some villagers were fishermen, beekeepers, or trappers. Farmland was divided into a unit called a ''kuritz'' ({{lang-la|uncus}}), for which peasants paid grain taxes to the ''voivot''.<ref name="C28"/>

===Military===

Polabian society developed during the 9th and 10th centuries under pressure from the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[Viking]]s of [[Scandinavia]]. They were often forced to pay [[tribute]] to the kings of [[Denmark]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] bishops, and imperial [[margrave]]s. Polabian society became militarized and its leaders began organizing armed forces and defenses. Many Polabian [[magnate]]s lived in forest fortresses, while towns were inhabited by warriors and [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]].<ref name="C28">Christiansen, 28</ref>

The magnates often raided Germanic territories or engaged in piracy. In times of large-scale war, the ''knes'' took overall command. The prince's ''[[voivot]]'' ensured military service from the warriors and taxes from the peasantry. While the countryside provided land forces, the towns were known for their [[longship]]s, which were lighter and lower than those used by the [[Danish people|Danes]] and [[Swedish people|Swedes]].<ref name="C15">Christiansen, 15</ref>

From a distance, Polabian fleets resembled those of the Scandinavians, although targets would recognize the Slavs' closely cropped hair and shrieking [[Battle cry|battle cries]] when they grew close.<ref name="C34">Christiansen, 34</ref> Polabian cavalry used [[Horses in the Middle Ages|small horses]] which were effective in quick raiding campaigns, but less effective against the [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] and Danish [[heavy cavalry]].<ref name="C35">Christiansen, 35</ref>

===Religion===
{{Main|Slavic mythology}}
Religion was an important aspect of Polabian society. Much of their territory was dotted with holy places in nature to which the Slavs could pray and make offerings to Slavic [[Deity|gods]]. The priesthood was an important class which developed images and objects of worship. Polabian towns often included elaborate temples often visited for offerings and pilgrimages. In contrast, priests in the countryside often lived meagerly.<ref name="C33"/>

The Polabian Slavs replaced the [[Germanic tribes]] who had emigrated from the 1st to 6th centuries during the [[Migration Period]]. Their settlement area was largely stable by the 8th century. [[Charlemagne]] enlisted the [[Obotrites]] as allies in his campaign against the rebellious [[Saxons]] of [[Holstein]]. Many of the Slavic tribes became dependencies of the [[Carolingian Empire]] and the [[Franks]] created the [[Sorbian March]] to defend against the [[Sorbs]].[[Einhard]] in ''[[Vita Karoli Magni]]'' describes an expedition into Slavic territory led by [[Charlemagne]] himself, in 798. The Veleti noted as Wilzi (referred to themselves as ''Welatabians'')<ref name="fordham.edu">http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/einhard.html#Slavic%20War</ref> were invaded by the [[Franks]] because of their continuous expeditions into [[Obodrite]] lands, with the Obodrites being allies of the Franks against the [[Saxons]].<ref name="fordham.edu"/><ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/ein.html Full Latin text] at the Latin Library</ref>

German campaigns against the Slavs began in earnest during the [[Ottonian dynasty]]. [[Henry the Fowler]] attacked the Slavs in several campaigns with his cavalry. During the reigns of Henry and his son [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], several marches were established to guard the eastern acquisitions, such as the [[Billung March]] to the north and the [[Marca Geronis]] to the south. After [[Gero]]'s death in 965, the Marca Geronis was divided into the [[Northern March]], the [[March of Lusatia]], and the [[Thuringian March]], the latter being divided into the marches of [[March of Zeitz|Zeitz]], [[March of Merseburg|Merseburg]], and [[March of Meissen|Meissen]]. Bishoprics such as [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg|Magdeburg]], [[Bishopric of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], and [[Bishopric of Havelberg|Havelberg]] were founded to support the conversion of the Slavs to [[Christianity]].

After the defeat of [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] at the [[Battle of Stilo]] in 982, the pagan Slavs rebelled against the [[Germans]] the following year; the [[Hevelli]] and [[Liutizi]] destroyed the Bishoprics of Havelberg and Brandenburg. Some Slavs advanced across the Elbe into Saxon territory, but retreated when the Christian Duke of Poland, [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], attacked them from the east. The [[Holy Roman Empire]] retained only nominal control over the Slavic territories between the Elbe and the Oder. Despite the efforts of Christian missionaries, most Polabian Slavs saw [[Jesus]] as a "[[Germanic Christianity|German god]]" and remained [[Slavic mythology|pagan]].

The Obotrite prince [[Udo (Obotrite prince)|Udo]] and his son [[Gottschalk (Obotrite prince)|Gottschalk]] expanded their realm by unifying the Obotrite tribes and conquering some Liutizi tribes in the 11th century. They encouraged the establishments of bishoprics to support Christian missionary activity. However, a revolt in 1066 led to the murder of Gottschalk and his replacement by the pagan [[Kruto]] of Wagria. Gottschalk's son [[Henry (Obotrite prince)|Henry]] eventually killed Kruto in 1093.

[[Image:Bishop Absalon topples the god Svantevit at Arkona.PNG|250px|thumb|right|[[Absalon|Danish Bishop Absalon]] destroys the idol of [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] god [[Svantevit]] at [[Cape Arkona|Arkona]] in a painting by [[Laurits Tuxen]].]]

From 1140-43 [[Holstein|Holsatian]] nobles advanced into [[Wagria]] to permanently settle in the lands of the pagan Wagri. Count [[Adolf II, Count of Holstein|Adolf II]] of Holstein and [[Henry of Badewide]] took control of [[Polabians (tribe)|Polabian]] settlements at [[Liubice]] and [[Racisburg]]. Impressed with the success of the [[First Crusade]], Saxons began calling for a crusade against their Slav neighbors. The [[Wendish Crusade]] of 1147, concurrent to the [[Second Crusade]], was largely unsuccessful, resulting in devastation to the Liutizi lands and forced [[baptism]]s. The campaign did secure Saxon control of [[Wagria]] and [[Polabia]], however. The Obotrites were largely at peace with the Saxons during the following decade, although Slavic pirates raided Denmark.

Beginning in the late 1150s, King [[Valdemar the Great]] of Denmark enlisted the aid of Duke [[Henry the Lion]] of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] against the Slavs; their cooperation led to the death of the Obotrite prince, [[Niklot]], in 1160. The two Christian lords distributed much of the conquered territory among their vassals. When Niklot's exiled son, [[Pribislav of Mecklenburg|Pribislav]], engineered an Obotrite rebellion, the pair retaliated by occupying [[Demmin]] and warding off Pribislav's Liutizian allies.

After conquering Wagria and Polabia during the 1140s, Saxon nobles attempted to expel the native Slavs and replace them with Saxon and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] settlers. The 1164 Obotrite revolt led by Niklot's son Pribislav convinced Henry the Lion that keeping the Slavs as allies would be less troublesome. The duke returned the Christian Pribislav to power as Prince of [[Mecklenburg]], [[Kessin]], and [[Rostock]], and a vassal of the Saxons.

Tactics and weaponry were decisive in Denmark's campaigns against the eastern Polabian Slavs. The Danes utilized quick coastal and river raids, tactics similar to those of the [[Vikings]]. Although they lacked siege experience, the Danes were able to cripple Slavic regions by burning crops and unwalled suburbs. Slav counterattacks were repulsed by [[crossbow]]s and Norwegian [[longbow]]s. The Danes occupied [[Rugia]] in 1168, conquering the [[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Rani]] stronghold of [[Cape Arkona|Arkona]]. Similar to Henry's reinstatement of Pribislav as a Saxon vassal, Valdemar allowed the Rani prince [[Jaromar I, Prince of R<U+00FC>gen|Jaromar]] to rule as a Christian Danish vassal. After Valdemar refused to share Rugia with Henry, the Saxon duke enlisted the aid of the Obotrite confederacy and the Liutizi against the Danes; Valdemar ended the conflict by paying Henry in 1171.

Alarmed at the expansion of Henry the Lion's power, Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] deposed the Saxon duke and redistributed his lands in 1180/81. The withdrawal of Saxon support left the Liutizi and their [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Pomeranian]] supporters vulnerable to the Danish fleet. A Slavic fleet attempting to reclaim Rugia was crushed at the [[Bay of Greifswald]] on 19 May 1184. Danish monks engaged in missionary activity in Pomeranian abbeys, and Prince [[Bogislaw I, Duke of Pomerania|Bogislaw I]] surrendered to King [[Canute VI of Denmark|Canute VI]] in 1185 to become the Danish king's vassal.

[[Pribislav (Hevelli prince)|Pribislav]], a Christian prince of the [[Hevelli]], bequeathed his lands to the Saxon [[Albert the Bear]] upon his death, thereby leading to the establishment of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].

The [[Lusatian Sorbs]] remained independent to a large extent. They were temporarily subdued by [[Charlemagne]], but upon his death the links with the Franks were broken. In a series of bloody wars between 929 and 963 their lands were conquered by King [[Henry the Fowler]] and his son [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]] and were incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Germany]]. By the 14th century, the majority of Slavs living there had been [[Germanization|Germanized]] and assimilated. However, the [[Sorbs]], the descendants of the [[Milceni]] and the Lusici, have retained their identity within [[Lusatia]], a region divided between the German states of [[Brandenburg]] and [[Saxony]].

The Slavic language was spoken by the descendants of the Drevani in the area of the lower Elbe until the early 18th century.
