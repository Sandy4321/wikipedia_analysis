{{Politics_of_New_Zealand}}
The '''New Zealand electoral system''' has been [[Mixed-member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) since 1996. MMP was introduced after a referendum in 1993. MMP replaced the [[First past the post electoral system|first past the post]] (FPP) system New Zealand had previously used for most of its history. 

New Zealand has one House of Representatives, usually with 120 members, although the number can increase because of (generally) one or two [[overhang seat]]s; depending on the outcome of the electoral process. The term of the [[New Zealand Parliament]] is set at three years. Whichever party (or combination of parties) wins the most seats at the general election becomes the Government.

In contemporary New Zealand, generally all permanent residents and citizens over 18 are eligible to vote. The main exceptions are when a person has been living overseas continuously for too long, has been detained in a psychiatric hospital, or since 2010, is currently  a sentenced prisoner.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.elections.org.nz/voters/enrol-check-or-update-now/who-can-and-cant-enrol | title=Who can and can't enrol? | publisher=New Zealand Electoral Commission | accessdate=4 September 2014 | author=New Zealand Electoral Commission}}</ref>

Historically, New Zealand was the first country in the world to give women the right to vote <U+2013> in 1893. This meant that theoretically, New Zealand had [[universal suffrage]] from 1893, meaning all adults 21 years of age and older were allowed to vote. However, the voting rules that applied to the European settlers did not apply to M<U+0101>ori <U+2013> and their situation is still unique, in that a number of seats in the New Zealand [[parliament]] are reserved exclusively for Maori.

== Term of Parliament ==

Although Parliamentary elections are held every three years, this has not always been the case. In New Zealand's early colonial history, elections were held every five years - as established by The New Zealand Constitution Act of 1852. The term was reduced to three years in 1879 because of concerns about the growing power of central Government.<ref name="The term of parliament">[http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/Chapter%206%20the%20term%20of%20parliament.pdf The term of parliament]</ref>

Since then, the term has been altered three times <U+2013> mainly in times of international crisis. During the First World War it was extended to five years. In the early 1930s, it was pushed out to four years. This proved to be unpopular with the electorate and after the election of 1935, the term was reduced to three years again. It was extended to four years once again during the Second World War, but returned to three years afterwards. In 1956, the term of three years was '[[Entrenched legislation|entrenched]]' in the Electoral Act which means that it can only be changed by achieving a majority in a national referendum or by a vote of 75% of all members of Parliament.<ref name="The term of parliament"/>

In 2013 the Government established an advisory panel to conduct a review of constitutional issues - including an examination of the term of parliament. Other issues discussed at public meetings held by the panel were the number of MPs New Zealand should have, whether a written constitution is needed, and whether all legislation should be consistent with the Bill of Rights Act.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10867918 Constitution review panel denies 'hidden agenda']</ref> Both Prime Minister John Key and Opposition leader [[David Shearer]] expressed support for an extension of the parliamentary term to four years.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10864096 Editorial: Four year term better for country]</ref> The main argument put forward in support of a longer term is that "Governments need time to establish and then implement new policies".

The last referendum on the term of parliament was in 1990 and found nearly 70% of the voters were opposed to extending the term. An opinion poll on the news website [[Stuff.co.nz]] in early 2013 found that of 3,882 respondents, 61% were in favour of changing to a four-year term.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mace |first=William |title=Support from business for longer terms |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/8371855/Support-from-business-for-longer-terms |accessdate=7 March 2013 |newspaper=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=2 March 2013}}</ref>

== M<U+0101>ori seats ==
{{Main|M<U+0101>ori electorates}}
A unique feature of New Zealand's electoral system is that a number of seats in Parliament are reserved exclusively for [[M<U+0101>ori people|M<U+0101>ori]]. However, this was not always the case. In the early colonial era, Maori could not vote in elections unless they owned land as individuals. European colonists  were quite happy with this state of affairs because, according to NZ History online, "they did not think Maori were 'civilised' enough to exercise such an important responsibility".<ref name="nzhistory.net.nz">[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/maori-and-the-vote/setting-up-seats Setting up the Maori seats <U+2013> Maori and the vote]</ref> At the time, M<U+0101>ori were dealing directly with the Crown in regard to the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] and had little interest in the 'pakeha parliament'.

During the [[New Zealand wars|wars of the 1860s]], some settlers began to realise it was necessary to bring M<U+0101>ori into the British system if the two sides were to get along. After much debate, in 1867 Parliament passed the Maori Representation Act which established four electorates solely for Maori.  The four Maori seats were a very minor concession; the settlers had 72 seats at the time and, on a per capita basis, Maori should have got up to 16 seats.<ref name="nzhistory.net.nz"/> All M<U+0101>ori men (but not women) over the age of 21 were given the right to vote and to stand for Parliament.

Full blooded Maori had to vote in the Maori seats and only Maori with mixed parentage ('half-castes') were allowed to choose whether they voted in European electorates or Maori electorates. This dual voting system continued until 1975.<ref name="nzhistory.net.nz"/> From time to time there was public discussion about whether New Zealand still needed separate seats for Maori <U+2013> which some considered to be a form of apartheid. Maori were only allowed to stand for election in European seats (or general electorates) from 1967.

In 1985, a [[Royal Commission on the Electoral System]] was established. It concluded that "separate seats had not helped Maori and that they would achieve better representation through a proportional party-list system". The Commission  recommended that if mixed member proportional (MMP) system was adopted, the M<U+0101>ori seats should be abolished. However, most M<U+0101>ori wanted to keep them and the seats were not only retained under MMP, their "number would now increase or decrease according to the results (population numbers) of the regular M<U+0101>ori electoral option". As a result in 1996 before the first MMP election, the number of M<U+0101>ori seats increased to five <U+2013> the first increase in 129 years. In 2002, it went up to seven.<ref name="ReferenceA">[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/maori-and-the-vote/twentieth-century Change in the 20th century - Maori and the vote]</ref>

==Developments in voting rights and eligibility==

=== Secret ballot ===

In European seats, the secret ballot was introduced in 1870.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> However, M<U+0101>ori continued to use a verbal system <U+2013> whereby electors had to tell the polling official which candidate they wanted to vote for. M<U+0101>ori were not allowed a secret ballot until 1938 and even voted on a different day. According to NZ History online: "Up until 1951 Maori voted on a different day from Europeans, often several weeks later." It was not until 1951 that voting in the four M<U+0101>ori electorates was held on the same day as voting in the general election.<ref>{{cite book |ref= harv |last= Wilson |first= James Oakley |title= New Zealand Parliamentary Record, 1840<U+2013>1984 |edition= 4th |origyear= First ed. published 1913 |year= 1985 |publisher= V.R. Ward, Govt. Printer |location= Wellington |oclc=154283103 |page=138}}</ref>

NZ History also states: "There were also no electoral rolls for the Maori seats. Electoral officials had always argued that it would be too difficult to register Maori voters (supposedly because of difficulties with language, literacy and proof of identity). Despite frequent allegations of electoral irregularities in the Maori seats, rolls were not used until the 1949 election."<ref name="nzhistory.net.nz"/>

=== Women's suffrage ===

{{main|Women's suffrage in New Zealand}}
In early colonial New Zealand, as in most Western countries, women were totally excluded from political affairs. Led by [[Kate Sheppard]], a women's suffrage movement began in New Zealand in the late 19th century, and the legislative council finally passed a bill allowing women to vote in 1893.<ref name="The right to vote">[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/womens-suffrage/brief-history The right to vote], New Zealand History Online</ref> This made New Zealand the first country in the world to give women the vote. However, they were not allowed to stand as candidates until 1919, and the first female Member of Parliament ([[Elizabeth McCombs]]) was not elected until 1933<ref name="The right to vote"/> <U+2013> 40 years later. Although there have been two female Prime Ministers ([[Jenny Shipley]] and [[Helen Clark]]), women remain somewhat under-represented in Parliament.<ref name="The right to vote"/> Following the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|election in 2011]], 39 MPs (almost one third) were women. After the 2011 election, on a global ranking New Zealand is 21st in terms of its representation of women in Parliament.<ref>[http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/ParlSupport/ResearchPapers/d/c/3/00PlibCIP191-The-2011-General-Election.htm The 2011 General Election]</ref>

=== Prisoners' right to vote ===

Restrictions have also been imposed on prisoners. In 2010, the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|National government]] passed The Electoral (Disqualification of Convicted Prisoners) Amendment Bill which removed the right of all sentenced prisoners to vote. The Attorney General said the new law was inconsistent with the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|Bill of Rights Act]] which says that "every New Zealand citizen who is over the age of 18 years has the right to vote and stand in genuine periodic elections of members of the House of Representatives".<ref name="Prisoners and the Right to Vote">[http://nzccl.org.nz/content/prisoners-and-right-vote Prisoners and the Right to Vote], NZ Council for Civil Liberties</ref> Prior to the 2010 Act, only prisoners with a sentence of three years or more were not allowed to vote <U+2013> which is also inconsistent with the Bill of Rights Act. The Electoral Disqualification Bill was also opposed by the Law Society and the [[Human Rights Commission (New Zealand)|Human Rights Commission]] who pointed out that, in addition to being inconsistent with the Bill of Rights, the legislation was also incompatible with various international treaties that New Zealand is party to.

Law Society Human Rights committee member, Frances Joychild, told Parliament's law and order committee that: "It is critical for the function of our democracy that we do not interfere with the right to vote." With specific reference to decisions made by courts in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and South Africa, she pointed out that "every comparable overseas jurisdiction has had a blanket ban (against prisoners' voting) struck down in the last 10 years".<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10675146 Inmate voting ban sorry waste of time], NZ Herald</ref>

==Election day==
Until the {{NZ election link|1938}}, elections were held on a weekday. In 1938 and in {{NZ election link year|1943}}, elections were held on a Saturday. In {{NZ election link year|1946}} and {{NZ election link year|1949}}, elections were held on a Wednesday.<ref>{{cite web |title=Under the Influence |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/election-day-through-years/under-influence |publisher=Electoral Commission |accessdate=9 August 2013 |date=15 February 2013}}</ref> In 1950, the legal requirement to hold elections on a Saturday was introduced,<ref name="Key dates in electoral reform">{{cite web |title=Key dates in New Zealand electoral reform |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/voting-system/history-vote/electoral-timeline |publisher=Elections New Zealand |accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref> and this first applied to the {{NZ election link|1951}}. Beginning with the {{NZ election link|1957}}, a convention was formed to hold general elections on the last Saturday of November.  This convention was upset by [[Robert Muldoon]] calling a snap election in {{NZ election link year|1984}}. It took until the {{NZ election link|1999}} to get back towards the convention, only for [[Helen Clark]] to call an early election in {{NZ election link year|2002}}. By the {{NZ election link|2011}}, the conventional 'last Saturday of November' was achieved again.<ref name="COLIN JAMES">{{cite news |last=James |first=Colin |title=John Key, modest constitutional innovator |url= http://www.colinjames.co.nz/ODT/ODT_2011/ODT_11Jun14.htm |accessdate=6 December 2011 |newspaper=[[Otago Daily Times]] |date=14 June 2011}}</ref> The last election was held on Saturday, 26 November 2011.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Zealand Election Results |url= http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/ |publisher=Electoral Commission |accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref> If the convention had been followed at the [[New Zealand general election, 2014|2014 general election]], it would have been held on 29 November 2014.

== MMP in New Zealand ==<!-- redir from MMP in New Zealand lands here-->
[[File:New Zealand MMP voting paper.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A sample MMP ballot paper]]

Up until 1994, New Zealand used the [[First past the post]] electoral system whereby whichever political party won the most seats on election day became the Government. This process favours two party systems and for the last 60 years, New Zealand elections have been dominated by the [[National Party of New Zealand|National Party]] and [[Labour Party of New Zealand|Labour Party]]. Smaller parties found it hard to gain representation and in 1994, New Zealand officially adopted [[Mixed-member proportional representation|mixed member proportional representation]] (MMP) as its electoral system. Its defining characteristic is a mix of members of Parliament (MPs) from single-seat electorates and MPs elected from a party list, with each party's share of seats determined by its share of the party vote nationwide.<ref>Electoral Commission [http://www.mmpreview.org.nz/sites/all/themes/referendum/resources/ProposalsPaper/MMP%20Proposal%20Paper.pdf Proposals Paper] 13 August 2012, p 3.</ref> The first MMP election was held in 1996. As a result, National and Labour lost their complete dominance in the House. Neither party has yet been able to govern on its own and has had to form coalitions in order to govern.  The closest either party has come to governing alone was the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 election]], when National won 59 seats, just 2 short of a majority.

Under MMP, New Zealand voters have two votes. The first vote is the ''electorate vote''. It determines the local representative for that [[New Zealand electorates|electorate]] ([[Electoral district|constituency]]). The electorate vote works on a plurality system whereby whichever candidate gets the greatest number of votes in each electorate wins the seat. The second vote is the ''party vote''. This determines the number of seats each party is entitled to overall <U+2013> in other words, the proportionality of the House.

'''Thresholds:''' There are two thresholds in the New Zealand MMP system.<ref name="Proposals Paper">Electoral Commission [http://www.mmpreview.org.nz/sites/all/themes/referendum/resources/ProposalsPaper/MMP%20Proposal%20Paper.pdf Proposals Paper] 13 August 2012, p 9.</ref> The first is that any Party which receives 5% or more of the Party vote is entitled to a share of the nominally 120 seats in the House of Representatives - even if the Party does not win a single electorate seat. For instance in the 2008 elections, the Greens failed to win any electorate seats but won 6.7% of the party vote and thereby earned nine seats in Parliament.<ref name="Proposals Paper"/>

The second threshold is that any Party that wins one or more electorate seats is entitled to additional (list) seats in parliament even if it doesn't win 5% of the Party vote. In 2008, the ACT Party won only 3.6% of the Party vote. But ACT got a total of five seats in Parliament because an ACT candidate won the Epsom electorate; this has been called the "coat-tailing" rule. <ref name="Proposals Paper"/> But the [[New Zealand First]] party which got 4.07% of the list vote or below the 5% threshold was not returned to parliament in 2008

Seats in parliament are allocated to electorate MPs first. Then Parties fulfil their remaining quota (based on their share of the Party vote) from their list members. A [[closed list]] is used, and list seats are allocated by the [[Sainte-Lague method]], which favours minor parties more than the alternative [[D'Hondt method]]. If a Party has more electorate MPs than proportional seats, then it receives an [[Overhang seat|overhang]]. If the Party does not have enough people on its list to fulfil its quota, then there is an [[Underhang seat|underhang]].

=== Strategic voting === 
The two largest parties [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] usually "top up" their electoral candidates with list candidates, so that supporting a candidate of a minor party allied with their party will not reduce the number of seats that the major party wins, but supporting the minor party will increase the number of MPs who support their party in coalition. This is called "[[strategic voting]]" or sometimes "tactical voting".

In several recent elections in New Zealand [[New Zealand National Party|National]] has suggested that National supporters in certain electorates should vote for minor parties or candidates who can win an electorate seat and would support a National government. This culminated in the [[Tea tape scandal]] when a meeting in the [[Epsom (NZ electorate)|Epsom electorate]] in [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011]] was taped. The meeting was to encourage National voters in the electorate to vote "strategically" for the [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] candidate; and it was also suggested that [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] voters in the electorate should vote "strategically" for the National candidate, as the Labour candidate could not win the seat but a National win in the seat would deprive National of an ally.

=== 2011 referendum and Electoral Commission 2012 report === <!-- from the 2014 general election article -->

A [[New Zealand voting system referendum, 2011|referendum on the voting system]] was held in conjunction with the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 general election]], with 57.8% of voters voting to keep the existing Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) voting system. The majority vote automatically triggered under the Electoral Referendum Act 2010 an independent review of the workings of the system by the Electoral Commission.

The Commission released a consultation paper in February 2012 calling for public submissions on ways to improve the MMP system, with the focus put on six areas: basis of eligibility for list seats (thresholds), by-election candidates, dual candidacy, order of candidates on party lists, overhang, and proportion of electorate seats to list seats. The Commission released its proposal paper for consultation in August 2012, before publishing its final report on 29 October 2012. In the report, the Commission recommended the following:<ref name="MMPproposal">{{cite web |url= http://www.mmpreview.org.nz/sites/default/files/pages/uploads/Final%20report%202012%20review%20of%20MMP.pdf |title= Report of the Electoral Commission on the review of the MMP voting system |publisher= Electoral Commission |date= 29 October 2012 |accessdate= 7 December 2012}}</ref>

* Reducing the party vote threshold from 5 percent to 4 percent. If the 4 percent threshold is introduced, it should be reviewed after three general elections.
* Abolishing the one electorate seat threshold <U+2013> a party must cross the party vote threshold to gain list seats.
* Abolishing the provision of overhang seats for parties not reaching the threshold <U+2013> the extra electorates would be made up at the expense of list seats to retain 120 MPs
* Retaining the status quo for by-election candidacy and dual candidacy.
* Retaining the status quo with closed party lists, but increasing scrutiny in selection of list candidates to ensure parties comply with their own party rules.
* Parliament should give consideration to fixing the ratio between electorate seats and list seats at 60:40 (72:48 in a 120-seat parliament)

Parliament is responsible for implementing any changes to the system, which has been largely unchanged since it was introduced in 1994 for the [[New Zealand general election, 1996|1996 election]]. In November 2012 a [[private member's bill]] under the name of opposition Labour Party member [[Iain Lees-Galloway]] was put forward to implement the first two recommendations, although the bill would have to be chosen in the member's bill ballot.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Legislation/ProposedBills/5/2/c/50HOH_MEMBILL158_1-Electoral-Adjustment-of-Thresholds-Amendment-Bill.htm |title= Electoral (Adjustment of Thresholds) Amendment Bill -- Proposed members' bills |publisher= New Zealand Parliament |date= 20 November 2012 |accessdate= 7 December 2012}}</ref>

In May 2014 Judith Collins and John Key said that there was no (inter-party) consensus on implementing the results of the Commission, so would not introduce any legislation.

== Electoral boundaries ==
The number of electorate MPs is calculated in three steps. The less populated of New Zealand's two principal islands, the [[South Island]], has a fixed quota of 16 seats. The number of seats for the [[North Island]] and the number of special reserved seats for M<U+0101>ori are then calculated in proportion to these. (The [[M<U+0101>ori electorates]] have their own special electoral roll; people of M<U+0101>ori descent may opt to enroll either on this roll or on the general roll, and the number of M<U+0101>ori seats is determined with reference to the number of adult M<U+0101>ori who opt for the M<U+0101>ori roll.)

The number of electorates is recalculated, and the boundaries of each redrawn so as to make them approximately equal in population within a tolerance of plus or minus 5%, after each [[quinquennial]] (five-year) [[census]]. After the 2001 census, there were 7 M<U+0101>ori electorates and 62 general electorates, or 69 electorates in total. There were therefore normally 51 list MPs. By a quirk of timing, the [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005 election]] was the first election since [[New Zealand general election, 1996|1996]] at which the electorates were not redrawn since the previous election.

The [[Gallagher Index]] is a measurement of how closely the proportions of votes cast for each party is reflected in the number of parliamentary seats gained by that party. The resultant disproportionality figure is a percentage - the lower the index, the better the match.<ref>Stephen Levine and Nigel S. Roberts, ''The Baubles of Office: The New Zealand General Election of 2005'' (Wellington: Victoria University Press, 2007), pp.33-4 ISBN 978-0-86473-539-3</ref>
