'''Tomasz Kuszczak''' ({{pronounced|<U+02C8>t<U+0254>ma<U+0283> <U+02C8>ku<U+0283>t<U+0283>ak}}, {{audio|Pl-tomasz-kuszczak.ogg|listen}}) (born [[20 March]] [[1982]] in [[Krosno Odrza<U+0144>skie]], [[Poland]]) is a [[Poland|Polish]] [[football (soccer)|football]] player, who is a [[goalkeeper]] with the [[Premier League|Premiership]] club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the [[Poland national football team]]. 

Kuszczak has previously played for [[<U+015A>l<U+0105>sk Wroc<U+0142>aw]] in Poland, as well as for the [[Germany|German]] clubs [[KFC Uerdingen 05]] and [[Hertha BSC Berlin]], before moving in 2004 to [[England|England's]] [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]. During the summer of 2006 he made the switch to Manchester United after a season of starting for West Brom in the Premiership.

Kuszczak made 14 appearances for the [[Poland national football team|Poland]] Under-21 side, and has been [[cap (sport)|capped]] five times at the senior level.

==Club career==
===Hertha Berlin===
Kuszczak joined [[Hertha BSC Berlin|Hertha Berlin]] in 2000, spending a year with their reserve team before being promoted to the first team in 2001. He subsequently spent three seasons as the third-choice goalkeeper at the club, behind [[G<U+00E1>bor Kir<U+00E1>ly]] and [[Christian Fiedler]], and failed to make a single appearance in the [[Bundesliga (football)|Bundesliga]]. He was out of contract with Hertha when he was signed by the then West Brom manager [[Gary Megson]] on [[July 14]] [[2004]].<ref>{{cite news

|publisher=BBC Sport
|accessdate=2007-07-04}}</ref> 

===West Bromwich Albion===
He made his debut for [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]] on [[September 18]] [[2004]] in the Premiership match against [[Fulham F.C.]] at [[The Hawthorns]], which ended in a 1-1 draw. He then played in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] match against [[Colchester United F.C.]] on [[September 21]] [[2004]], Albion losing 1-2.

Kuszczak had only kept goal in one match in the Premier League before West Brom's game against Manchester United on the penultimate match day of the [[FA Premier League 2004-05|2004-05 season]], with the Baggies facing a tough relegation battle. He put in a striking performance, having to step in front of the goal after the first choice keeper [[Russell Hoult]] was injured in the first half. West Brom drew the match 1-1, with Kuszczak remaining unbeaten during his 68 minutes on the pitch. This performance helped Kuszczak earn his first Man of the Match award in the Premiership. The following week, in the season's last match against Portsmouth, Kuszczak had another impressive game, enabling West Brom to win 2-0, and hence stay up in the league. He is also very proactively involved in promoting community education.
In [[FA Premier League 2005-06|2005-06]], Kuszczak was supposed to be the reserve keeper behind [[Chris Kirkland]]. With Kirkland injured, Kuszczak kept in his first Premiership match of the season on [[October 30]] [[2005]], but could not prevent [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] from winning 3-0. His performances then improved, allowing him to become the first choice keeper. This continued despite Kirkland's return from injury. 

On [[January 15]] [[2006]], Kuszczak had an impressive game against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan]], making a match-winning save late on against [[Jason Roberts (footballer)|Jason Roberts]], with West Brom winning the game 1-0. The save was voted ''Save of the Season'' by viewers of BBC TV's [[Match of the Day]] programme.

On [[July 7]] [[2006]], it was confirmed by West Bromwich Albion manager [[Bryan Robson]] that [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] made a bid for Kuszczak of around <U+00A3>2 million. On [[August 3]], West Bromwich Albion rejected a <U+00A3>2.5 million bid for Kuszczak from Manchester United, citing that a one-year loan spell for United starlet [[Giuseppe Rossi]] would also have to be included along with the cash to result in a deal. On [[August 10]] [[2006]], Kuszczak joined [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in a deal involving the transfer of England Under-18 goalkeeper [[Luke Steele (footballer)|Luke Steele]] and defender [[Paul McShane]] to West Brom.

===Manchester United===
When officially announcing the move, Manchester United failed to state the terms, leading to suggestions that it was a merely a loan deal. Chief executive [[David Gill]] has since clarified the situation:

"Tomasz will be a Manchester United player for the next four years", he said. "He has come to us on loan for the first year, and then will join us permanently in July 2007. We would not have been interested in signing any player, even as one as good as Tomasz, on loan. We would hope Tomasz remains a Manchester United player for many years to come."<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200608/s1713334.htm ABC Sport - Football - Kuszczak pens four-year United deal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Kuszczak made his debut in a [[Premier League]] match against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on [[September 17]] [[2006]], and he earned the Manchester United fans' respect when he saved an early [[Gilberto Silva]] penalty. He could not, however, save United from a 1-0 defeat, when [[Emmanuel Adebayor]] scored the late winner.

In his first start, against [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] in the [[Football League Cup|Carling Cup]], the name on the back of his goalkeeper shirt was spelled incorrectly; instead of Kuszczak, his name had been spelled "Zuszczak".

Although Kuszczak didn't play enough Premiership games in the 2006-07 season, he received a [[winners medal]] by special application to the Premier League.

On [[July 2]] [[2007]], Manchester United announced that the permanent transfer had been completed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&newsid=440998 |title=Reds complete triple signing |accessdate=2007-07-02 |author=Steve Bartram |date=2007-07-02 |publisher=ManUtd.com }}</ref>

Due to Dutch keeper [[Edwin Van der Sar]]'s presence at the club, Kuszczak has been named Manchester United's number 2 for the new football season (2007), during an interview in May 2007 Kuszczak stated that he one day wanted to become the number 1 at Manchester United and with [[Ben Foster (footballer)|Ben Foster]] as the only competition for the number 1 spot, this ambition looks likely for the near future. Although since Ben Foster has already been tipped to be number 1 for the current season, and only injury has prevented this, Kuszczak has got another season to impress the Old Trafford faithful.

==International career==
Kuszczak had also played two international matches by this time, his debut coming on [[December 11]] [[2003]] against [[Malta national football team|Malta]]. Poland won the away game 0-4.

Due to his impressive performances for [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]], although the club was ultimately relegated, he was called up to the 23-men [[Poland national football team]] for the [[FIFA World Cup 2006]]. However in a World Cup warm-up match between Poland and [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] on [[May 30]] [[2006]], he recorded a remarkable feat of conceding a goal directly from a long punt by the opposition goalkeeper, [[Luis Enrique "Neco" Martinez|Neco Mart<U+00ED>nez]].<ref>{{cite news

|title= 					Kuszczak defiant despite blunder 
|publisher=BBC Sport
|accessdate=2007-07-04}}</ref> [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaNnLL69BP0 (YouTube Video)] He subsequently ended up as [[Artur Boruc]]'s back-up during the tournament and did not play. Curiously, his rival [[Ben Foster (footballer)|Ben Foster]] made a similar blunder a year later.
