'''Jean-Michel Nicollier''' (1 July 1966 - 20 November 1991) was a [[France|French]] volunteer and [[Croatia]]n soldier in the [[Croatian War of Independence]] who was killed during the [[Vukovar massacre]].

==Early years==
Nicollier was born on July 1, 1966 in [[Vesoul]], [[France]] to his mother Lyliane Fournier.<ref name="vecernji-2012-06"/> He was raised with his brothers Pierre and Paul as a middle child. In Vesoul he finished elementary and high school.<ref name="vecernji-2012-06"/> Nicollier watched the horrors of the Croatian War of Independence on television in France, and then decided to travel to Croatia and help in the defense.<ref name="vecernji-2012-06"/> Nicollier told his mother: {{quote|I want to help these people, they need me. I have to go, but I'll be back. You know that I'm a wild grass that never goes away.<ref name="vecernji-2011">{{cite news|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/majka-osjetio-je-bozji-poziv-nisam-mogla-sprijeciti-da-ode-clanak-347189|title=Majka: Osjetio je Bo<U+017E>ji poziv, nisam mogla sprije<U+010D>iti da ode|date=2011-11-17|newspaper=[[Ve<U+010D>ernji list]]|language=Croatian| accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref>}} In July 1991, he boarded the train and arrived in [[Zagreb]] completely alone.<ref name="vecernji-2012-06"/> There he joined the [[Croatian Defence Forces]]<ref name="slobodna-2012"/> and was set off to the front along the [[Kupa]] river in [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]].<ref name="vecernji-2012-06"/> While in Croatia, he was nicknamed "French" by his comrades.

==Battle of Vukovar==
In September 1991, Nicollier arrived in [[Vukovar]] with the last volunteers.<ref name="vecernji-2012-06">{{cite news|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/prica-dragovoljcu-tudini-koji-nema-grob-clanak-416785|title=Pri<U+010D>a o dragovoljcu u tu<U+0111>ini koji nema grob|date=2012-06-03|newspaper=[[Ve<U+010D>ernji list]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref><ref name="slobodna-2012"/> Nicollier fought across the [[Battle of Vukovar|Vukovar battlefields]] and was wounded twice in the three months he was there.<ref name="slobodna-2012"/> On November 9, 1991 he was wounded in the leg by a [[fragmentation grenade]], and was transported to the Vukovar hospital where he was treated for his injuries.<ref name="vecernji-2012-06"/> Nicollier stayed in the Vukovar hospital until the fall of Vukovar on November 18, 1991.

On November 20, 1991, Nicollier was interviewed by the French reporter Agnes Vahramian, describing his experience in Vukovar as "a slaughterhouse".<ref name="hrt-2011"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.24sata.hr/news/jean-michel-hvala-ti-ucit-cemo-svoju-djecu-o-tvojem-herojstvu-242735|title=Jean Michel, hvala ti, u<U+010D>it <U+0107>emo svoju djecu o tvojem herojstvu|date=2011-11-17|newspaper=[[24sata (Croatia)|24sata]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>
The same day, he was taken from the hospital by [[Yugoslav People's Army]] and local Serb forces, transported to the hangars at Ov<U+010D>ara farm.<ref name="vecernji-2012-06"/><ref name="slobodna-2012"/>

At Ov<U+010D>ara, according to later witness testimonies, a man named Kemo took him from the hangars, at which point Nicollier was viciously beaten, and killed by a gunshot to the head by one Spasoje Petkovi<U+0107>, who then took 20 [[French franc|francs]] from his pocket.<ref name="vecernji-2012-06"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/jean-michela-nicoliera-ubio-je-spasoje-petkovic-stuka-clanak-364380|title=Jean-Michela Nicoliera ubio je Spasoje Petkovi<U+0107> <U+0160>tuka|date=2012-01-09|newspaper=[[Ve<U+010D>ernji list]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.69.html:162169-Stuka-se-hvalioda-je-streljao|title=<U+0160>tuka se hvalio da je streljao|date=2004-09-27|newspaper=[[Novosti AD]]|language=Serbian|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref> Nicollier's remains were among the sixty that were not subsequently found.<ref name="slobodna-2012">{{cite news|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Hrvatska/tabid/66/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/189345/Default.aspx|title=Pri<U+010D>a o hrvatskom domoljubu Jeanu Michelu Nicolieru, mu<U+010D>ki likvidiranom na Ov<U+010D>ari, zaslu<U+017E>uje da ode u svijet|date=2012-10-03|newspaper=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref> It's possible that they were initially disposed of in shallow graves, which caused them to be uncovered by the following spring and then thrown elsewhere,<ref name="slobodna-2012"/> or that they were thrown into the Danube.<ref name="vecernji-2011"/>

==Legacy==
On November 15, 2006 Nicollier was posthumously awarded the Memorial Plaque "Vukovar 1991".

In 2010, Croatian authors Vi<U+0161>nja Stare<U+0161>ina and Ivan Malo<U+010D>a released a documentary film about the Vukovar massacre, that told the story of [[Sini<U+0161>a Glava<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]] as well as Jean-Michel Nicollier, and was aired in prime-time by the [[Croatian Radiotelevision]] on the 19th anniversary of the event.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/na-ovcari-su-ubijeni-srbi-ali-francuski-njemacki-dobrovoljci-clanak-216982|title=Na Ov<U+010D>ari su ubijeni i Srbi, ali i francuski i njema<U+010D>ki dobrovoljci|date=2010-11-18|newspaper=[[Ve<U+010D>ernji list]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>

Prompted by the publicity Nicollier's case received in 2010, a Croatian veteran Antun Ivankovi<U+0107> from [[Tovarnik]] joined with Nevenka Neki<U+0107>, a retired professor who was personally connected to the Battle of Vukovar, to investigate the story and contacted Nicollier's mother in France.<ref name="vecernji-2011"/> In October 2011, Ivankovi<U+0107> found that Nicollier was never entered into the official list of Croatian defenders, and advocated for the problem to be rectified; the [[Ministry of Veterans' Affairs (Croatia)|Ministry of Veterans' Affairs]] soon responded by entering Nicollier into the Registry.<ref name="vecernji-2011"/>

On November 17, 2011, at the initiative of an NGO led by Ivankovi<U+0107>, Nicollier was posthumously awarded with the [[Vukovar-Syrmia County]] Tribute for "love, loyalty and bravery in the Croatian War of Independence".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vfm.hr/vijesti/slavonija/1378|title=Priznanja <U+017E>upanije|date=2011-11-09|publisher=VFM Radio|location=Vinkovci, Croatia|language=Croatian|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref> That same day, Nicollier was awarded with the [[Order of Nikola <U+0160>ubi<U+0107> Zrinski]] for heroism. Nicollier's mother came to Zagreb with Nicollier younger brother Paul, to receive the order from the President of Croatia [[Ivo Josipovi<U+0107>]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.predsjednik.hr/17112016|title=Predsjednik Josipovi<U+0107> posmrtno odlikovao vukovarskog branitelja Jean Michela Nicolliera|date=2011-11-17|publisher=Ured Predsjednika Republike Hrvatske|language=Croatian|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref><ref name="hrt-2011">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrt.hr/index.php?id=vijesti-clanak&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=139081&cHash=0f94295d8d|title=Posmrtno odlikovan Jean Michel Nicollier|date=2011-11-17|publisher=[[Croatian Radiotelevision]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref> 

In June 2012, Neki<U+0107> published the book ''Jean ili miris smrti'' ("Jean or smell of death") about Nicollier and his time in Vukovar.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/kultura/predstavljen-roman-francuskom-dragovoljcu-ubijenom-ovcari-clanak-419276|title=Predstavljen roman o francuskom dragovoljcu ubijenom na Ov<U+010D>ari|date=2012-06-12|newspaper=[[Ve<U+010D>ernji list]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>

On August 31, 2012, again at the initiative of Ivankovi<U+0107>'s NGO, Nicollier's mother met the Croatian Minister of Veterans' Affairs Predrag Mati<U+0107> who confirmed she was entitled to the veteran's pension of her late son.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/mirovina-majku-vukovarskog-junaka-jean-michela-nicoliera-clanak-415593|title=Mirovina za majku vukovarskog junaka Jean-Michela Nicoliera|date=2012-05-30|newspaper=[[Ve<U+010D>ernji list]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/majci-francuskog-dragovoljca-ubijenog-ovcari-stan-mirovina-clanak-448033|title=Majci francuskog dragovoljca ubijenog na Ov<U+010D>ari stan i mirovina|date=2012-08-31|newspaper=[[Ve<U+010D>ernji list]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>
