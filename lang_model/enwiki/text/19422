The Honourable '''John Foster McCreight''' ([[1827]]&ndash;[[November 18]], [[1913]]) was a jurist and the first [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]] of the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[British Columbia]].

==Early life==
McCreight was born in [[Caledon, County Tyrone|Caledon]], [[County Tyrone]], [[Ireland]] to a well-established and well-connected family.  After completing law studies at [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]], [[Dublin]], McCreight was called to the bar in [[1852]]. Shortly thereafter, McCreight left Ireland to establish a practice in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. For unknown reasons, McCreight left Australia in 1859 and sailed first to [[San Francisco]], and then to [[Victoria, British Columbia]].

==Life and career in British Columbia==
At the time of McCreight's arrival in Victoria in [[1860]], it was the capital of the [[Colony of Vancouver Island]], which at the time was governed by the powerful and autocratic [[factor|Chief Factor]] of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], [[James Douglas (governor)| Sir James Douglas]].  In [[1862]], McCreight was called to the British Columbia bar, and opened a practice in Victoria.  By all accounts, he led a quiet and solitary life in the city, his main occupations outside of his work being his involvement in the local [[freemasonry|Masonic Lodge]] and as an active layperson in the congregation of the local [[Anglican]] [[cathedral]].

By [[1866]], the colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia had merged.  Although the united colony did not join the [[Canadian confederation]] when it was effected in [[1867]], the worrisome economic and strategic situation soon made such an arrangement attractive.  British Columbia joined confederation on [[July 20]], [[1871]], and McCreight joined the interim transitional cabinet as [[Attorney General of British Columbia|Attorney General]].  During the first provincial general election that October, McCreight won a seat for [[Victoria City (electoral district)|Victoria City]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia|legislature]], and [[Sir Joseph Trutch]], the [[Lieutenant Governor]], chose him to be British Columbia<U+2019>s first premier. He continued to hold the attorney-generalship as well.

By all accounts, McCreight was temperamentally ill-suited to public life.  His colleague, [[Henry Pering Pellew Crease]], described the Premier as "bad tempered and queer...by fits & turns extremely credulous & extremely suspicious...excessively obstinate in the wrong places...close and reserved in his daily life...[and] utterly ignorant of politics"[http://www.biographi.ca/EN/ShowBio.asp?BioId=41699&query=McCreight].  Nonetheless, McCreight's administration was a productive one, passing three dozen pieces of legislation in less than a year.  His inability to form alliances and mollify the sometimes narrow and sectional interests of [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLAs]] led to a loss of support, however, and in 1872 he resigned after losing a [[motion of no confidence]] following the [[Speech from the Throne]].

==Supreme Court Justice and retirement==
McCreight remained in the legislature until 1875, after which he returned to his law practice as a [[Queen's Counsel]].  Five years later, he was made a [[judge|justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]].  In that capacity, he served in the [[Cariboo]], Victoria, and finally - in 1883 - [[New Westminster]] before retiring in 1897, at the age of 70.  McCreight returned to the [[United Kingdom]], dying at [[Hastings]], [[East Sussex]] at the age of 86.
