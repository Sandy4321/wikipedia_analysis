'''''Enneacanthus gloriosus''''' is a species of [[fish]] in the [[Centrarchidae]], the sunfishes, known by the common name '''blue-spotted sunfish'''. It is native to the southeastern and eastern  United States, its distribution extending as far north as [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], and far southern [[New York]].<ref name=iucn>Hammerson, G., NatureServe.

Several aspects of the life history of the fish vary geographically. Fish on the East Coast and in [[Florida]] are larger than individuals in [[Mississippi]], for example. The fish becomes sexually mature at larger sizes in more northern latitudes. This may be because fish in milder climates can begin reproductive investment earlier, putting their energy into [[Fish#Reproductive_system|gonadal]] growth instead of body growth at younger ages. Fish in the east can reach a maximum age around 5 yr, but fish in the south generally do not reach that age. The [[spawning]] season is also much longer in southern regions, probably because of warmer temperatures and longer [[Photoperiodism|photoperiod]].<ref name=sny2>Snyder, D. J. and M. S. Peterson. (1999).

This freshwater fish occupies ponds, lakes, creeks, streams, and medium-sized rivers. It can tolerate slightly [[brackish]] water in areas near the coast. It thrives in small backwaters filled with vegetation and tree roots.<ref name=ns/>

The fish spawns several times in a season, sometimes daily for a long period of time.<ref name=sny2/> The male builds a nest in the substrate or in plant matter.<ref name=ns/> Clutch sizes of 42 to 216 have been observed.<ref name=sny2/>

The diet of the fish is rich in [[plankton]]. It consumes [[Cyclopoida|cyclopoid copepods]], [[cladocera|water fleas]], [[Chironomidae|midge larvae]], [[ostracod]]s,<ref name=usgs/> [[amphipod]]s, and [[snail]]s.<ref name=ny>Kraft, C. E., et al.

In many areas, this fish is [[sympatric]] with a closely related member of its genus, the [[banded sunfish]] (''E. obesus''). The two species are hard to tell apart. They are known to [[hybrid (biology)|hybridize]].<ref name=pete/>

A number of parasitic [[monogenea|flatworms]] have been observed in this fish, such as ''[[Gyrodactylus gloriosi]]'' and several ''[[Urocleidus]]'' species.<ref name=may>Mayes, M. A. (1973).

This species is sometimes kept as an [[aquarium]] pet.<ref name=usgs/><ref name=ny/>
