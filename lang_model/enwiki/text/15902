'''''Amblin'''''' is a [[short subject|short film]] released in [[1968 in film|1968]]. It is the first completed film shot by [[Steven Spielberg]] on [[35mm]]. The film is a short story set during the hippy era of the late 60's about a young couple who meet up in the desert, become friends, then lovers and make their way to a paradisiacal beach.

==Plot==
A young guy, carrying a closely guarded guitar case, hooks up with a free spirited girl when hitchhiking across the desert in southern [[California]] en route to the [[Pacific]] coast. Along the way, the man engaged the girl in an [[olive]] spitting contest and the girl initates the guy into the joys of [[dope]] smoking and [[sex]] in a [[sleeping bag]].  As the pair reach the beach, the guy frolics in the surf and the girl checks out the contents of his guitar case: a suit and tie, toothpase, mouthwash, a roll of toilet paper and a copy of Arthur Clarkes [[The City and the Stars]]. The girl smiles in bemusement, perhaps sensing all along that her compansion was a geek.

==Casting== 
Spielberg found his lead actor Richard Levin working as a librarian in the [[Beverly Hills]] library. For the mysterious redhead in the film, Spielberg discovered Pamela McMyler from the Academy Players directory. She had previously been a member of the Pasadena playhouse and had an insignficant role in [[The Boston Strangler]].

==Steven Spielberg as writer and director==
Amblin became a reality after Spielberg was introduced to wannable producer Dennis Hoffman. This movie, only 24 minutes long, led to his becoming the youngest director ever to be signed to a long-term deal with a major Hollywood studio (Universal) after Sid Sheinberg, then the vice-president of production for Universals' TV arm saw the film. The movie had a $15,000 budget. In 1968, his friend Dennis Hoffman provided financing of approximately $10,000 for the production of the film. At the time, Hoffman had no experience in producing, writing or developing projects for motion pictures.  Hoffman requested, and Spielberg agreed, that the music of a band then being managed by Hoffman be used in the "Amblin'" film, and Spielberg used the music of Hoffman's band in the film.

In exchange for the financing provided by Hoffman, Hoffman exacted from Spielberg the young filmmaker's agreement to (a) direct "Amblin'" for no compensation whatsoever and (b) be bound for ten years to direct any script selected by Hoffman if such a script was brought to Spielberg by Hoffman. As compensation for this second film, Spielberg was to receive the payment of $25,000 plus 5% of the profits after expenses (the so called "1968 Amblin Contract").

==Production==
Amblin' started shooting on 6th July 1968 at Dennis Hoffmans cinefx soundstake. The filming commenced with a complicated trackin shot following a trail of mathces leading to a bonfire which was shot in the studio in order that cinematopgrapher Allen Davia could control the lightning. After cinefx and the filing of the films final sequence outside Jack Palances beach house in [[Malibu]], the crew moved on to various desert locations around Pearblossom, North California, for the remaining eight days of filming. Under the rough terrain and punishing 105 degrees sun, many of Spielbergs unpaid crew left before the shoot was completed. Spielberg confessed to one crew member that he had vomited every day before he went to the set.

==Release and Impacts==
Opening on December 18th, 1968 at Lowes Crest Theathre in [[Los Angeles]] Amblin' shared a double bill with Otto Premingers Skiddo. Amblin won several film festival awards including a showing at the Atlanta film Festival in 1969. Spielberg was then signed to a 7-year contract under the Television division of Universal. In later years Spielberg would name is successful company after his first movie - [[Amblin Entertainment]], of which ''[[Schindler's List]]'' is is its most acclaimed film.

==Trivia==
* The film is silent but is accompanied by an acoustic guitar led soundtrack from beginning to end.  

* [[Anne Spielberg]] (Steven's sister) who wrote [[Big]] also worked with him on this first effort which started his career and won him his first contract at Universal.
