After graduation, he joined the [[Kobe]] branch of [[Konami]] in 1991, where he contributed music to eight arcade games with several collaborators over a three-year period.

Following ''Final Fantasy X'', Nakano co-composed the soundtracks to [[Asmik Ace Entertainment]]'s flight simulators ''SideWinder F'' and ''SideWinder V''.

When starting out in the field of music, he was influenced by brass bands he was involved with and electronic organ music; however, he could not think of a specific musician who influenced him. Nakano cites Hamauzu as the colleague he admires most at Square Enix, and is particularly interested in the sounds he creates. When asked about his thoughts of Uematsu and how he had influenced his work, Nakano replied: "He is a very youthful and active person, but he hasn't influenced my work."<ref name="Interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/composers/nakano/feb02interview.shtml|title=Interview with Junya Nakano (RocketBaby - February 2002)|publisher=Square Enix Music Online|accessdate=2009-06-22}}</ref>
