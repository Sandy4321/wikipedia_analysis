'''Operation Cobra''' was the codename for an offensive launched by the [[First United States Army]] seven weeks after the [[D-Day]] landings, during the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy Campaign]] of [[World War II]]. American Lieutenant General [[Omar Bradley]]'s intention was to take advantage of the German preoccupation with British and Canadian activity around the town of [[Caen]], and immediately punch through the German defenses that were penning in his troops while the Germans were distracted and unbalanced. Once a corridor had been created, the First Army would then be able to advance into [[Brittany]], rolling up the German flanks and freeing itself of the constraints imposed by operating in the Norman [[bocage]] countryside. After a slow start the offensive gathered momentum, and German resistance collapsed as scattered remnants of broken units fought to escape to the [[Seine]]. Lacking the resources to cope with the situation, the German response was ineffectual, and the entire Normandy front soon collapsed. Operation Cobra, together with concurrent offensives by the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second British]] and [[First Canadian Army|First Canadian]] Armies, was decisive in securing an Allied victory in the Normandy Campaign.

Having been delayed several times by poor weather, Operation Cobra commenced on 25 July with a concentrated [[strategic bombing|aerial bombardment]] from thousands of Allied aircraft. Supporting offensives had drawn the bulk of German armored reserves toward the British and Canadian sector, and coupled with the general lack of men and [[materiel]] available to the Germans, it was impossible for them to form successive lines of defense. Units of [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] led the initial two-division assault while other First Army corps mounted supporting attacks designed to pin German units in place. Progress was slow on the first day, but opposition started to crumble once the defensive crust had been broken. By 27 July, most organized resistance had been overcome, and VII and [[VIII Corps (United States)|VIII Corps]] were advancing rapidly, isolating the [[Cotentin peninsula]].

By 31 July, [[XIX Corps (United States)|XIX Corps]] had destroyed the last forces opposing the First Army, and Bradley's troops were finally freed from the bocage. Reinforcements were moved west by [[Field Marshal (Germany)|Field Marshal]] [[G<U+00FC>nther von Kluge]] and employed in various counterattacks, the largest of which (codenamed [[Operation L<U+00FC>ttich|Operation ''L<U+00FC>ttich'']]) was launched on 7 August between [[Mortain]] and [[Avranches]]. Although this led to the bloodiest phase of the battle, it was mounted by already exhausted and understrength units and had little effect other than to further deplete von Kluge's forces. On 8 August, troops of the newly-activated [[Third United States Army]] captured the city of [[Le Mans]], formerly the German [[7th Army (Germany)|Seventh Army]]'s headquarters. Operation Cobra transformed the high-intensity infantry combat of Normandy into rapid maneuver warfare, and led to the creation of the [[Falaise pocket]] and the loss of the German position in northwestern France.

==Background==
{{See|Invasion of Normandy|Operation Overlord}} 

Following the successful [[Western Allies|Allied]] [[Invasion of Normandy]] on 6 June 1944, progress inland was slow. To facilitate the Allied build-up in France and to secure room for further expansion, the [[deep water port]] of [[Cherbourg]] on the western flank of the American sector and the historic town of [[Caen]] in the British and Canadian sector to the east represented early objectives.<ref>Van der Vat, p. 110</ref> The original plan for the Normandy campaign envisioned strong offensive efforts in both sectors, in which Lieutenant-General Sir [[Miles Dempsey]]'s British [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] would secure Caen and the area south of it,<ref>Bradley, p. 261</ref> and Lieutenant General [[Omar Bradley]]'s [[United States First Army|U.S. First Army]] would "wheel round" to the [[River Loire|Loire]].<ref>Williams, p. 24</ref>

General [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]]<U+2014>commanding all Allied ground forces in Normandy<U+2014>intended Caen to be taken on D-Day, while Cherbourg was expected to fall 15 days later.<ref>Williams, p. 38</ref> Second Army was to seize Caen and then form a front to the south-east, extending to [[Caumont-l'<U+00C9>vent<U+00E9>]], to acquire airfields and protect First Army's left flank while it moved on Cherbourg.<ref>Ellis, p. 78</ref> Possession of Caen and its surroundings<U+2014>desirable for open terrain that would permit maneuver warfare<ref>Greiss, p.308</ref><U+2014>would also give Second Army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]], which could be used as the pivot for a swing right to advance on [[Argentan]] and then towards the [[Touques River]].<ref>Ellis, p. 81</ref> Caen's capture has been described by historian L. F. Ellis as the most important [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]] objective assigned to Lieutenant-General [[John Crocker|Crockers]]'s [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]]. However, both Ellis and [[Chester Wilmot]] characterize the Allied plan as "ambitious";{{#tag:ref|"The quick capture of that key city [Caen] and the neighbourhood of Carpiquet was the most ambitious, the most difficult and the most important task of Lieutenant-General J.T. Crocker's I Corps".<ref>Ellis, p. 171</ref> Wilmot states "The objectives given to Crocker's seaborne divisions were decidedly ambitious, since his troops were to land last, on the most exposed beaches, with the farthest to go, against what was potentially the greatest opposition."<ref>Wilmot, p. 272</ref>|group=nb}} the Caen sector contained the strongest defences in Normandy.<ref name=Keegan/>
[[File:Battleforceanmapenglish.PNG|300px|thumb|right|Anglo-Canadian offensives in the Caen area after D-Day, from 6 June-20 July 1944]]

The initial attempt by I Corps to reach the city on D-Day was blocked by elements of the [[21st Panzer Division]], and with the Germans committing to the city's defense most of the reinforcements sent to meet the invasion,{{#tag:ref|These included the bulk of the available armored reserves: the [[1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS ''Adolf Hitler'']], the [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend]], and the [[Panzer-Lehr-Division]].<ref name= Keegan/>|group=nb}} the Anglo-Canadian front rapidly congealed short of Second Army's objectives.<ref>Bercuson, p. 215</ref> [[Operation Perch]] in the week following D-Day, and [[Operation Epsom]] (26<U+2013>30 June) brought some territorial gains and depleted its defenders, but Caen remained in German hands until [[Operation Charnwood]] (7<U+2013>9 July), when the Second Army managed to take the northern part of the city up to the [[River Orne]] in a frontal assault.<ref name=Keegan>Keegan, p. 135</ref><ref name="Williams131">Williams, p. 131</ref>

The successive Anglo-Canadian offensives around Caen were drawing the best of the German forces in Normandy, including most of the available armor, to the eastern end of the Allied [[lodgement]].<ref name=Keegan/> Even so, the U.S. First Army was struggling to make progress against dogged German resistance. In part, operations were slow due to the constraints of the [[bocage]] landscape of densely-packed banked hedgerows, sunken lanes, and small woods, for which U.S. units had not trained.<ref>Greiss, p. 317</ref> Furthermore, with no port facilities in Allied hands, all reinforcement and resupply had to take place over the beaches and was at the mercy of the weather.<ref>Greiss, p. 308<U+2013>310</ref> On 19 June, a severe storm descended on the [[English Channel]], lasting for three days and causing significant delays to the Allied build-up and the cancellation of some planned operations.<ref name="Williams114">Williams, p. 114</ref> First Army's attempt to press forward in the western sector was eventually halted by Bradley before the town of [[Saint-L<U+00F4>]],<ref name=Williams163>Williams, p. 163</ref> in order to prioritize operations directed at the seizure of Cherbourg.<ref name=Greiss312>Greiss, p. 312</ref> Cherbourg's defenders were not set up for robust performance, consisting largely of four battlegroups formed from the remnants of units that had retreated up the Cotentin peninsula; the port's defences had been designed principally to meet an attack from the sea.<ref>Hastings, p. 163</ref> However, organized German resistance ended only on 27 June, when the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]] managed to reduce the defences of Cap-de-la-Hague northwest of the city.<ref>Hastings, p. 165</ref> Within four days, Major General [[J.

==Planning==
{{See|Operation Cobra order of battle}}

The originator of the idea for ''Operation Cobra'' remains disputed. According to Montgomery's official biographer, the foundation of Operation Cobra was laid on 13 June.<ref name=Hastings249/><ref>Williams, p. 126</ref> Planning was immensely aided by detailed [[Ultra]] Intelligence which supplied up-to-date decodes of communications between German High Command and Hitler's generals.<ref>Lewin, p. 336</ref> Montgomery's plan at that time called for Bradley's First Army to take Saint-L<U+00F4> and [[Coutances]] and then make two southward thrusts; one from [[Caumont]] toward [[Vire]] and [[Mortain]], and the other from Saint-L<U+00F4> toward [[Villedieu]] and [[Avranches]]. Although pressure was to be kept up along the Cotentin Peninsula towards [[La Haye-du-Puits]] and [[Valognes]], the capture of Cherbourg was not an immediate priority.<ref name=Hastings249/> However, with Cherbourg's seizure by Collins' VII Corps on 27 June, Montgomery's initial timetable was soon outdated<ref name=Greiss312/> and the thrust from Caumont was never adopted.<ref>Esposito, p.78-80</ref>

Following the conclusion of Operation Charnwood and the cancellation of First Army's offensive towards Saint-L<U+00F4>,<ref>Wilmot, p. 351</ref><ref>Greiss, p. 311</ref> Montgomery met with Bradley and Dempsey on 10 July to discuss [[21st Army Group]]'s next move.<ref name=Trew49>Trew, p. 49</ref> During the meeting, Bradley admitted that progress on the western flank was very slow.<ref name= Williams163/>{{#tag:ref|By 10 July, Bradley had become concerned enough to write that the Allies faced the possibility of a [[World War I]]-type [[stalemate]] in the campaign.<ref name=Bradley272/><ref>Zaloga, p. 7</ref>|group=nb}} However, he had been working on plans for a breakout attempt, codenamed Operation Cobra, to be launched by the First Army on 18 July.<ref>Blumenson, p. 187</ref><ref>Zaloga, p.32</ref><ref>D'Este, p.338</ref><ref>Weigley, p.136</ref><ref>Pogue, p.197</ref><ref>Williams, p. 175</ref> He presented his ideas to Montgomery,<ref name=Bradley272>Bradley, p. 272</ref> who approved, and the directive that emerged from the meeting made it clear that the overall strategy over the coming days would be to draw enemy attention away from the First Army to the British and Canadian sector;<ref name=Williams163/> Dempsey was instructed to "go on hitting: drawing the German strength, especially the armour, onto yourself<U+2014>so as to ease the way for Brad[ley]".<ref name=Trew49/> To accomplish this, [[Operation Goodwood]] was planned,<ref>Trew, p. 64</ref> and Eisenhower ensured that both operations would have the support of the Allied air forces with their strategic bombers.<ref name=Williams163/>

On 12 July, Bradley briefed his subordinate commanders on the Cobra plan, which consisted of three phases. The main effort would be under the control of Collins' VII Corps. In the first phase, the breakthrough attack would be conducted by Major General [[Manton S. Eddy|Eddy's]] [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th]] and Major General [[Leland Hobbs|Hobbs']] [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th]] infantry divisions, which would punch a hole in the German tactical zone and then hold the flanks of the penetration while Major General [[Clarence Huebner|Huebner's]] [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry]] and Major General [[Edward H. Brooks|Brooks']] [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored]] divisions pushed into the depth of the position until resistance collapsed.<ref name=Hastings252/> The 1st Infantry Division "was to take Marigny, with this objective exploited by a stream of General Watson's 3rd Armored Division armor that would move south toward Coutances."<ref name="Yenne 2004 49">{{cite book |title= Operation Cobra and the Great Offensive: Sixty Days that Changed the Course of World War II |last= Yenne|first= Bill|year= 2004|publisher= Simon & Schuster|location= New York|isbn= 978-1-4391-8263-5|page= 49}}</ref> The 2nd Armored Division<U+2014>part of "Collins' exploitation force" of the 2nd Armored Division in the east of the VII Corps sector and the "1st Infantry Division reinforced by Combat Command B (CCB) of the 3rd Armored division in the west"<ref>*{{cite book|first=Steven J.|last=Zaloga|title=Operation Cobra 1944: Breakout from Normandy| publisher=Praeger|year=2004|isbn=0-275-98263-7|page=44}}</ref><U+2014>would "pass through the 30th Infantry Division sector ... and guard the overall American left flank."<ref name="Yenne 2004 49"/> If VII Corps' efforts were successful the western German position would become untenable, permitting a relatively easy advance to the southwest end of the bocage to cut off and seize the [[Brittany]] peninsula.<ref name=Hastings250>Hastings, p. 250</ref><ref>Esposito, pp. 76<U+2013>77</ref> First Army's intelligence estimated that no German counterattack would occur in the first few days after Cobra's launch, and that if attacks materialized after that date, they would consist of no more than battalion-sized operations.<ref name=Williams185/>

Cobra was to be a concentrated attack on a {{convert|7000|yd|m|abbr=on}} front, unlike previous American 'broad front' offensives,<ref name=Hastings249-250/> and would have heavy air support.<ref name=Hastings249-250>Hastings, pp. 249<U+2013>250</ref> Fighter-bombers would concentrate on hitting forward German defenses in a {{convert|250|yd|m|abbr=on}} belt immediately south of the Saint-L<U+00F4><U+2013>Periers road, while General [[Carl Andrew Spaatz|Spaatz]]'s heavy bombers would bomb to a depth of {{convert|2500|yd|m|abbr=on}} behind the German main line of resistance.<ref name="Williams, p. 181">Williams, p. 181</ref> It was anticipated that the physical destruction and shock value of a short, intense preliminary bombardment would greatly weaken the German defense,<ref name= Hastings249-250/> so in addition to divisional artillery, Army- and Corps-level units would provide support, including nine heavy, five medium, and seven light artillery battalions.<ref name= Weigley151/> Over 1,000 tubes of divisional and corps artillery were committed to the offensive,<ref name=Weigley151>Weigley, p. 151</ref> and approximately 140,000 artillery rounds were allocated to the operation in VII Corps alone, with another 27,000 for VIII Corps.<ref>Griess, p. 324</ref><ref>Blumenson, p. 219</ref>

In an attempt to overcome the mobility constraints of the bocage that had made offensive operations so difficult and costly for both sides, "[[Rhino Tank|Rhino]]" modifications were made to some [[M4 Sherman]] and [[Stuart tank|M5A1 Stuart]] tanks, and [[M10 Tank Destroyer|M10 tank destroyers]], by fitting them with hedge-breaching 'tusks' that were capable of forcing a path through the Norman hedgerows.<ref name=Hastings252>Hastings, p. 252</ref> While German tanks remained restricted to the roads, U.S. armor would now be able to maneuver more freely,<ref name=Hastings252/> although in practice these devices were not as effective as often believed.<ref>Zaloga, p.3</ref> However, by the eve of Cobra, 60% of First Army's tanks were so equipped.<ref>Weigley, p.149</ref> To preserve operational security, Bradley forbade their use until Cobra was launched.<ref>Blumenson, p.207</ref> In all, 1,269 M4 medium tanks, 694 M5A1 light tanks, and 288 M10 tank destroyers were available.<ref name="Zaloga, p.30">Zaloga, p.30</ref>

[[File:Fightinggoodwood.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wales|Welsh]] soldiers in action near [[Cagny, Calvados|Cagny]], 19 July 1944]]

On 18 July, the British [[VIII Corps (United Kingdom)|VIII]] and [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]]<U+2014>to the east of Caen<U+2014>launched Operation Goodwood. The offensive began with the largest air bombardment in support of ground forces yet, with more than 1,000 aircraft dropping {{convert|6000|ST|t|lk=on|abbr=on}} of high explosive and fragmentation bombs from low altitude.<ref name=Williams161>Williams, p. 161</ref> German positions to the east of Caen were shelled by 400 artillery pieces and many villages were reduced to rubble,<ref name="Williams161"/> but German artillery further to the south, on the [[Bourgu<U+00E9>bus|Bourgu<U+00E9>bus Ridge]], was outside the range of the British artillery,<ref name="Williams165">Williams, p. 165</ref> and the defenders of [[Cagny, Calvados|Cagny]] and [[<U+00C9>mi<U+00E9>ville]] were largely unscathed by the bombardment.<ref name= Williams167>Williams, p. 167</ref> This contributed to the losses suffered by Second Army, which sustained over 4,800 casualties.{{#tag:ref|I Corps suffered 3,817 casualties and VIII Corps suffered 1,020 casualties.<ref>Wilmot, p. 362</ref>|group=nb}} Principally an armored offensive, between 250 and 400 British tanks were put out of action,{{#tag:ref|Reynolds claims that a careful study of the relevant documents indicate a maximum tank loss of 253 tanks during Goodwood, most of which were repairable,<ref>Reynolds, p. 186</ref> but Buckley claims 21st Army Group lost around 400 tanks during the operation, although he too notes that most were eventually recovered.<ref>Buckley, p. 36</ref>|group=nb}} although recent examination suggests that only 140 were completely destroyed with an additional 174 damaged.<ref>Trew, pp. 97<U+2013>98</ref> The operation remains the largest tank battle ever fought by the British Army,<ref>Van-Der-Vat, p. 158</ref> and resulted in the expansion of the Orne bridgehead and the final capture of Caen.<ref name= "Williams131"/>

Simultaneously, the [[II Canadian Corps]] on Goodwood's western flank launched [[Operation Atlantic]]. Intended to strengthen the Allied foothold along the banks of the Orne River and take Verri<U+00E8>res Ridge to the south of Caen,<ref name="CoppAtVR">Copp, Approach to Verri<U+00E8>res Ridge</ref> Atlantic made initial gains but ran out of steam as casualties mounted.<ref name=Hastings236/> Having cost the Canadians 1,349 men and with the heavily-defended ridge firmly in German hands,<ref>Zuehlke, p. 166</ref> Atlantic was closed down on 20 July. However, at Montgomery's urging, "strongly underlined in the Supreme Commander's communications to Montgomery", II Canadian Corps's commander, Lieutenant-General [[Guy Simonds]], launched a second offensive a few days later, codenamed [[Operation Spring]].

==Allied offensive==
===Preliminary attacks===
[[File:Collinsbradley.jpg|thumb|left|Bradley and Collins near [[Cherbourg]]]]

To gain good terrain for Operation Cobra, Bradley and Collins conceived a plan to push forward to the Saint-L<U+00F4><U+2013>Periers road, along which VII and VIII Corps were securing jumping-off positions.<ref name=Hastings249>Hastings, p. 249</ref> On 18 July, at a cost of 5,000 casualties, the American [[29th Infantry Division (United States)|29th]] and [[35th Infantry Division (United States)|35th Infantry Divisions]] managed to gain the vital heights of Saint-L<U+00F4>, driving back ''General der Fallschirmtruppen'' [[Eugen Meindl]]'s II Parachute Corps.<ref name=Hastings249/> Meindl's paratroopers, together with the [[352nd Infantry Division (Germany)|352nd Infantry Division]] (which had been in action since its D-Day defense of [[Omaha Beach]]) were now in ruins, and the stage for the main offensive was set.<ref name=Hastings249/> Due to poor weather conditions that had also been hampering Goodwood and Atlantic, Bradley decided to postpone Cobra for a few days<U+2014>a decision that worried Montgomery, as the British and Canadian operations had been launched to support a break-out attempt that was failing to materialize.<ref name=Hastings253>Hastings, p. 253</ref><ref name=Williams174>Williams, p. 174</ref> By 24 July the skies had cleared enough for the start order to be given, and 1,600 Allied aircraft took off for Normandy.<ref name= Hastings253/> However, the weather closed in again over the battlefield. Under poor visibility conditions, more than 25 Americans were killed and 130 wounded in the bombing before the air support operation was postponed until the following day. Some enraged soldiers opened fire on their own aircraft, a not uncommon practice in Normandy when suffering from friendly fire.<ref name= Hastings253/>

[[File:Saint Lo and Vicinity - Operation Cobra.jpg|thumb|300px|Operation Cobra 25<U+2013>29 July 1944]]

After the one-day postponement, Cobra got underway at 09:38 on 25 July, when around 600 Allied fighter-bombers attacked strongpoints and enemy artillery along a {{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=on}}-wide strip of ground located in the St. L<U+00F4> area.<ref>Williams, p. 180</ref> For the next hour, 1,800 heavy bombers of the U.S. [[Eighth Air Force]] saturated a {{convert|6000|x|2200|yd|m|abbr=on}} area on the Saint-L<U+00F4><U+2013>Periers road, succeeded by a third and final wave of medium bombers.<ref name=Hastings254>Hastings, p. 254</ref> Approximately 3,000 U.S. aircraft had [[Carpet bombing|carpet-bombed]] a narrow section of the front, with the ''[[Panzer-Lehr-Division]]'' taking the brunt of the attack.<ref name="Williams, p. 181"/> However, once again not all the casualties were German; Bradley had specifically requested that the bombers approach the target from the east, out of the sun and parallel to the Saint-L<U+00F4><U+2013>Periers road, in order to minimize the risk of friendly losses, but most of the airmen instead came in from the north, perpendicular to the front line.<ref name=Hastings254/> Bradley, however, had apparently misunderstood explanations from the heavy bomber commanders that a parallel approach was impossible because of the time and space constraints Bradley had set. Additionally, a parallel approach would not in any event have assured that all bombs would fall behind German lines because of deflection errors or obscured aim points due to dust and smoke.<ref name= Sullivan107>Sullivan, p. 107</ref> Despite efforts by U.S. units to identify their positions, inaccurate bombing by the Eighth Air Force killed 111 men and wounded 490.<ref name=Williams182>Williams, p. 182</ref> The dead included Bradley's friend and fellow West Pointer Lieutenant General [[Lesley McNair]]<U+2014>the highest-ranking U.S. soldier to be killed in action in the [[European Theater of Operations]].<ref name=Williams182>Williams, p. 182</ref>

By 11:00, the infantry began to move forward, advancing from crater to crater beyond what had been the German outpost line.<ref name=Williams182/> Although no serious opposition was forecast,<ref name=Williams183/> the remnants of Bayerlein<U+2032>s ''Panzer Lehr''<U+2014>consisting of roughly 2,200 men and 45 armored vehicles<ref name=Hastings256/><U+2014>had regrouped and were prepared to meet the advancing U.S. troops, and to the west of ''Panzer Lehr'' the German 5th Parachute Division had escaped the bombing almost intact.<ref name=Williams183>Williams, p. 183</ref> Collins' VII Corps were quite disheartened to meet fierce enemy artillery fire,<ref name=Hastings255/> which they expected to have been suppressed by the bombing.<ref name=Hastings255>Hastings, p. 255</ref> Several U.S. units found themselves entangled in fights against strongpoints held by a handful of German tanks, supporting infantry and [[88 mm gun|{{convert|88|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} gun]]s<ref name= Hastings255/><U+2014>VII Corps gained only {{convert|2200|yd|m|abbr=on}} during the rest of the day.<ref name=Williams183/> However, if the first day's results had been disappointing, General Collins found cause for encouragement; although the Germans were fiercely holding their positions, these did not seem to form a continuous line and were susceptible to being outflanked or bypassed.<ref name=Hastings255/> Even with prior warning of the American offensive, the British and Canadian actions around Caen had convinced the Germans that the real threat lay there, and tied down their available forces to such an extent that a succession of meticulously prepared defensive positions in depth, as encountered during Goodwood and Atlantic, were not created to meet Cobra.<ref name= Hastings256/>
[[File:Saint Lo Breakthrough.jpg|thumb|300px|The St. L<U+00F4> breakthrough, 25<U+2013>31 July]]

On the morning of 26 July, the U.S. [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]] and the veteran [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] joined the attack as planned,<ref name=Williams183/> reaching one of Cobra's first objectives<U+2014>a road junction north of [[Le Mesnil-Herman]]<U+2014>the following day.<ref name=Hastings257>Hastings, p. 257</ref> Also on the 26th, Major General [[Troy H. Middleton]]'s VIII Corps entered the battle, led by the [[8th Infantry Division (United States)|8th]] and 90th Infantry Divisions.<ref name=Hastings258/> Despite clear paths of advance through the floods and swamps across their front, both divisions initially disappointed the First Army by failing to gain significant ground,<ref name=Hastings258>Hastings, p. 258</ref> but first light the next morning revealed that the Germans had been compelled to retreat by their crumbling left flank, leaving only immense minefields to delay VIII Corps' advance.<ref name=Hastings258/> By noon on 27 July, the 9th Infantry Division of VII Corps was also clear of any organized German resistance, and was advancing rapidly.<ref name=Hastings257/>

===Breakout and advance 28<U+2013>31 July===
By 28 July, the German defenses across the U.S. front had largely collapsed under the full weight of VII and VIII Corps' advance, and resistance was disorganised and patchy.<ref name=Hastings258/> VIII Corps' [[4th Armored Division (United States)|4th Armored Division]]<U+2014>entering combat for the first time<U+2014>captured Coutances but met stiff opposition east of the town,<ref name=Hastings258/> and U.S. units penetrating into the depth of the German positions were variously counterattacked by elements of the [[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich|2nd SS Panzer]], [[17th SS Panzergrenadier Division G<U+00F6>tz von Berlichingen|17th SS Panzergrenadier]], and 353rd Infantry Divisions, all seeking to escape entrapment.<ref name=Hastings260>Hastings, p. 260</ref> A desperate counterattack was mounted against the 2nd Armored Division by German remnants, but this was a disaster and the Germans abandoned their vehicles and fled on foot.<ref name=Hastings260/> An exhausted and demoralized Bayerlein reported that his ''Panzer Lehr Division'' was "finally annihilated", with its armor wiped out, its personnel either casualties or missing, and all headquarters records lost.<ref name=Williams185/>
[[File:Coutances.jpg|thumb|left|US [[Stuart tank|M5A1 Stuart]] tank of the 4th Armored Division (VIII Corps) in Coutances]]

Meanwhile, Marshal von Kluge<U+2014>commanding all German forces on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] (''[[OB West|Oberbefehlshaber West]]'')<U+2014>was mustering reinforcements, and elements of the [[2nd Panzer Division (Germany)|2nd]] and [[116th Panzer Division (Germany)|116th Panzer Division]]s were approaching the battlefield. The U.S. XIX Corps<U+2014>led by Major General [[Charles H. Corlett]]<U+2014>entered the battle on 28 July on the left of VII Corps, and between 28 and 31 July became embroiled with these reinforcements in what would be the fiercest fighting since Cobra began.<ref>Hastings, p. 261</ref> When ordered to concentrate his division, Colonel [[Heinz G<U+00FC>nther Guderian]]<U+2014>116th Division's senior staff officer<U+2014>was frustrated by the high level of Allied fighter-bomber activity.<ref name=Hastings262/> Without receiving direct support from the 2nd Panzer Division as promised, Guderian stated that his panzergrenadiers could not successfully counterattack the Americans.<ref>Hastings, p. 263</ref>

During the night of 29 July near [[Saint-Denis-le-Gast]], in the afore-mentioned action to the east of Coutances, elements of the U.S. 2nd Armored Division found themselves fighting for their lives against a German column from the 2nd SS Panzer and 17th SS Panzergrenadier Divisions, which passed through the American lines in the darkness.<ref name=Hastings260/> Other elements of the 2nd Armored were attacked near Cambry and fought for six hours; however, Bradley and his commanders knew that they were currently dominating the battlefield, and such desperate assaults were not a genuine threat to the American position.<ref name=Hastings260/> 

On 30 July, to protect Cobra's flank and prevent the disengagement and relocation of further German forces, the British [[VIII Corps (United Kingdom)|VIII Corps]] and [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] launched [[Operation Bluecoat]] south from [[Caumont-l'<U+00C9>vent<U+00E9>|Caumont]] toward [[Vire]] and [[Mont Pin<U+00E7>on]].<ref>Hastings, p. 265</ref> Advancing southward along the coast, later that day, the U.S. VIII Corps seized the town of Avranches<U+2014>described by historian Andrew Williams as "the gateway to Brittany and southern Normandy"<ref name=Williams185>Williams, p. 185</ref><U+2014>and by 31 July XIX Corps had thrown back the last German counterattacks after fierce fighting, inflicting heavy losses in men and tanks.<ref name=Hastings262>Hastings, p. 262</ref> The American advance was now relentless, and the First Army was finally free of the bocage.<ref name=Williams185/>

==Aftermath==
[[File:Breakout.jpg|thumb|300px|Map showing the breakout from the Normandy beachhead]]

At noon on 1 August, the [[United States Third Army|U.S. Third Army]] was activated under the command of Lieutenant General [[George S. Patton]]. Lieutenant General [[Courtney Hodges]] assumed command of the First Army and Bradley was promoted to the overall command of both armies, named the  U.S. 12th Army Group.<ref>Hastings, p. 266</ref> Patton wrote a poem containing the words:
{{quote|So let us do real fighting, boring in and gouging, biting.<br> Let's take a chance now that we have the ball.<br> Let's forget those fine firm bases in the dreary shell raked spaces,<br> Let's shoot the works and win! Yes, win it all!<ref name=Williams186>Williams, p. 186</ref>}}

The U.S. advance following Cobra was extraordinarily rapid. Between 1 August and 4 August, seven divisions of Patton's Third Army had swept through Avranches and over the bridge at [[Pontaubault]] into Brittany.<ref>Wilmot, p.399</ref> The [[Westheer|German army in Normandy]] had been reduced to such a poor state by the Allied offensives that, with no prospect of reinforcement in the wake of the [[Operation Bagration|Soviet summer offensive]] against [[Army Group Centre]], very few Germans believed they could now avoid defeat.<ref>Hastings, p. 277</ref> Rather than order his remaining forces to withdraw to the Seine, [[Adolf Hitler]] sent a directive to von Kluge demanding "an immediate counterattack between [[Mortain]] and Avranches"<ref>D'Este, p. 414</ref> to "annihilate" the enemy and make contact with the west coast of the Cotentin peninsula.<ref name= Williams196>Williams, p. 196</ref> Eight of the nine Panzer divisions in Normandy were to be used in the attack but only four (one of them incomplete) could be relieved from their defensive tasks and assembled in time.<ref name=Wilmot401>Wilmot, p.401</ref> German commanders immediately protested that such an operation was impossible given their remaining resources<ref name= Williams196/> but these objections were overruled and the counter-offensive, codenamed [[Operation L<U+00FC>ttich]], commenced on 7 August around Mortain.<ref>Hastings, p. 283</ref> The 2nd, 1st SS and 2nd SS Panzer Divisions led the assault, although with only 75 [[Panzer IV]]s, 70 [[Panther tank|Panther]]s, and 32 [[self-propelled gun]]s between them.<ref>Hastings, p. 285</ref> Hopelessly optimistic, the offensive threat was over within 24 hours, although fighting continued until 13 August.<ref>Hastings, p. 286</ref>

By 8 August, the city of [[Le Mans]]<U+2014>the former headquarters of the German [[7th Army (Germany)|7th Army]]<U+2014>had fallen to the Americans.<ref>Williams, p. 194</ref> With von Kluge's few remaining battleworthy formations destroyed by the First Army, the Allied commanders realised that the entire German position in Normandy was collapsing.<ref name=Williams197>Williams, p. 197</ref> Bradley declared:

{{quote|This is an opportunity that comes to a commander not more than once in a century. We're about to destroy an entire hostile army and go all the way from here to the German border".<ref name=Williams197/>}}

On 14 August, in conjunction with American movements northward to [[Chambois]], Canadian forces launched [[Operation Tractable]]; the Allied intention was to trap and destroy the entire German Seventh and Fifth Panzer Armies near the town of [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]].<ref>Hastings, p. 301</ref> Five days later, the two arms of the encirclement were almost complete; the advancing U.S. 90th Infantry Division had made contact with the Polish [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|1st Armored Division]], and the first Allied units crossed the [[River Seine|Seine]] at [[Mantes-la-Jolie|Mantes Gassicourt]] while German units were fleeing eastward by any means they could find.<ref>Williams, p. 203</ref> By 22 August, the [[Falaise Pocket]]<U+2014>which the Germans had been fighting desperately to keep open to allow their trapped forces to escape<U+2014>was finally sealed, effectively ending the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]] with a decisive Allied victory.<ref name=Bercuson232>Bercuson, p. 232</ref> All German forces west of the Allied lines were now dead or in captivity<ref>Hastings, p. 306</ref> and although perhaps 100,000 German troops succeeded in escaping they left behind 40,000<U+2013>50,000 prisoners and over 10,000 dead.<ref name= Williams204/> A total of 344 tanks and self-propelled guns, 2,447 [[soft-skinned vehicle]]s and 252 artillery pieces were found abandoned or destroyed in the northern sector of the pocket alone.<ref name=Hastings313>Hastings, p. 313</ref> The Allies were able to advance freely through undefended territory, and by 25 August all four Allied armies (1st Canadian, 2nd British, 1st U.S., and 3rd U.S.) involved in the Normandy campaign were on the river Seine.<ref name= Williams204>Williams, p. 204</ref>
