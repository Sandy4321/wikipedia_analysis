{{nihongo|'''Marshtomp'''|<U+30CC><U+30DE><U+30AF><U+30ED><U+30FC>|Numakur<U+014D>|Numacraw}} is one of the {{pokenum}} [[fictional species]] of Pok<U+00E9>mon creatures from the multi-billion-dollar<ref> <U+201C>[http://sev.prnewswire.com/entertainment/20051004/LATU06404102005-1.html Pokemon (sic) Franchise Approaches 150 Million Games Sold]<U+201D>, ''PR Newswire''. URL accessed on February 28, 2006.</ref> ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon]]'' [[media franchise]] &ndash; a collection of [[video game]]s, [[anime]], [[manga]], [[book]]s, [[trading card]]s and other media created by [[Satoshi Tajiri]]. Marshtomp is most famous for being an [[Evolution (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|evolution]] of one of the three Pok<U+00E9>mon players can choose from at the beginning of their adventure in the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby'']] & [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Sapphire'']] and ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Emerald]]'' versions of the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon]] series. Its main purpose in the games, as with all other Pok<U+00E9>mon, is to battle both "wild" Pok<U+00E9>mon, untamed creatures that are encountered while players pass through various natural environments in the game, and to fight against "tamed" Pok<U+00E9>mon owned by [[Pok<U+00E9>mon trainer]]s. 

The drawing and sprite design of Marshtomp was created by [[Ken Sugimori]]'s team for its 2003 release on the ''[[Nintendo Game Boy Advance]]''. Many gamers have criticized the Advanced Generation artwork as a whole, since Ken Sugimori, the designer of all of the first and second generation Pok<U+00E9>mon, led the design team, resulting in the Pok<U+00E9>mon appearing in a more naturalistic style, compared to the anthropormorphistic style of the ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue|Pok<U+00E9>mon Red]]'' & [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Blue'']] and ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Gold and Silver|Pok<U+00E9>mon Gold]]'' and [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Gold and Silver|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Silver'']] games.

==Characteristics==
The surface of Marshtomp's body is enveloped by a thin, sticky film that enables it to live on land.  Because it weakens if its skin dries out, it replenishes fluids by playing in [[mud]].  So, Marshtomp like to play in mud on beaches when the tide is low. Though it is a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon types#Water-type|Water]] Pok<U+00E9>mon, Marshtomp is much faster at traveling through mud than it is at [[swim]]ming. Its hindquarters exhibit obvious development, giving it the ability to walk on just its hind legs.  Also, like its preceder, [[Mudkip]], it can use the fin on its head to navigate.

Marshtomp, like most other Pok<U+00E9>on species, have average base stats, their base HP of 70, Attack of 85, Defense of 70, Special attack of 60, Special defense of 70, and speed of 50 make it no better nor worse than any other Pok<U+00E9>mon. <ref name=dex2>{{Cite web|url=http://pokemonelite2000.com/v2pokedex008.html|title=Marshtomp's Pok<U+00E9>dex information along with stats and breeding info|publisher=pokemonelite2000.com|date=[[July 20]], [[2006]]}}</ref>

== In the Pok<U+00E9>mon video games ==
One of the things consistent among most of the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon video games|''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' games]]<U+2014>spanning from ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue]]'' on the [[Game Boy line|''Nintendo Game Boy'']] to the un-released ''[[Nintendo DS]]'' game, ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl]]''<U+2014>is the choice of three different Pok<U+00E9>mon at the start of the player's adventures; these three are often labelled "Starter Pok<U+00E9>mon".  Players can choose a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon type#Water-type|Water-type]], a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon type#Fire-type|Fire-type]], or a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon type#Grass-type|Grass-type]] Pok<U+00E9>mon indigenous to the region; an exception to this rule is ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow]]'' (a remake of the original games that follows the story of the ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)|Pok<U+00E9>mon anime]]''), where players are given a [[Pikachu]]<U+2014>an [[Pok<U+00E9>mon type#Electric-type|Electric-type]] mouse famous for being the mascot of the Pok<U+00E9>mon [[media franchise]].<ref>[http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/162/162045p1.html ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow'' Critical Review] ''Ign.com''.

Its ability is ''Torrent'', so when Marshtomp has less than one third of its HP left, its water power increases to 1.5 times the power. <ref name=dex2/> Marshtomp can [[Pok<U+00E9>mon breeding|breed]] from both the Monster egg group and the Water (A) egg group, making it able to have babies with Pok<U+00E9>mon from any of its groups.

==In the Pok<U+00E9>mon anime==
[[Image:Abadon ship 1.JPG|thumb|left|The Marshtomp that finds its trainer in Pok<U+00E9>mon Episode 308 "Abandon Ship".]]
The [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)|''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' anime]] [[television series|series]] and [[film]]s are a set of adventures separate from most other versions of ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'', featuring [[Ash Ketchum]] as the main character, and following his quest to become a Pok<U+00E9>mon Master &ndash; though what constitutes a Master is somewhat ambiguous. He and his companions travel around the Pok<U+00E9>mon world battling other [[Pok<U+00E9>mon trainer]]s. 

One of [[Ash Ketchum|Ash]]'s several companions, [[Brock (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Brock]], an aspiring [[Pok<U+00E9>mon breeding|Pok<U+00E9>mon breeder]] who specializes in [[Pok<U+00E9>mon types#Rock-type|Rock-type]] Pok<U+00E9>mon, owns a [[Mudkip]], which he caught while travelling with Ash in [[Hoenn]].

Various other Marshtomp have appeared in the anime, the first appearing in Episode 308: "Abandon Ship",<ref> [http://www.serebii.net/anime/epiguide/houen/308.shtml Episode 308.

== In the Pok<U+00E9>mon Trading Card Game ==
[[Image:Marshtomp tcg.JPG|thumb|right|Marshtomp in the Pok<U+00E9>mon Trading Card Game.]]

The ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Trading Card Game]]'' is a [[Collectible card game|collectable card game]] first published by [[Wizards of the Coast]] in [[North America]], in 1999. The concept is similar to that of a Pok<U+00E9>mon battle in the video games in that each player takes turns to hit the opponent<U+2019>s Pok<U+00E9>mon. It is now published by Nintendo. Most Marshtomp cards are typical, Stage-1 Pok<U+00E9>mon cards, primarily used to play stronger cards, such as Stage-2 Pok<U+00E9>mon, [[Swampert]] and [[Charizard]]. Marshtomp cards have some similarities with fellow starter evolutions, [[Wartortle]] and [[Croconaw]].

Marshtomp, despite being an evolution of a Starter-Pok<U+00E9>mon, a group of Pok<U+00E9>mon who are given significant prevelance in the ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Trading Card Game]]'' because of their rarity in the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon video games|''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' video games]], has not appeared frequently in the series. It has appeared in the EX Ruby & Sapphire set (twice), the EX Dragon set and in the EX Emerald set.

==In other media==
[[Ruby (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Ruby]]'s, a male protagonist in the ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Adventures]]'' series (a [[manga]] based on the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Advanced Generation'' games]]) starter Pok<U+00E9>mon is a [[Mudkip]] named ''Zuzu'', which he received from [[Professor Birch]]. Zuzu evolved into Marshtomp unexpectedly while Ruby was in [[Slateport City]] and again into [[Swampert]] while training near [[Fortree City]]. Zuzu was first used to battle in "Chapter 183 VS. Torchic", against [[Sapphire (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Sapphire]], his rival in the manga.<ref> [http://www.serebii.net/manga/rs/183.shtml Synopsis of Pok<U+00E9>mon Adventures Manga;'' Chapter 183. VS.
