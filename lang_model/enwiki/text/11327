"'''Bad Reputation'''" is the seventeenth episode of the [[United States|American]] television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. The episode premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network on May 4, 2010. It was directed by [[Elodie Keene]], and written by series creator [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]]. In "Bad Reputation", cheerleading coach [[Sue Sylvester]] ([[Jane Lynch]]) is publicly ridiculed when a video of her dancing to [[Olivia Newton-John]]'s "[[Physical (Olivia Newton-John song)|Physical]]" is posted on [[YouTube]]. A salacious list about members of the [[glee club]] circulates the school, leading certain members to try and earn themselves a bad reputation. Newton-John guest-stars as herself in the episode, and [[Molly Shannon]] makes her first appearance in a recurring role. Following their romance in the episode "[[Mash-Up (Glee)|Mash-Up]]", club members [[Rachel Berry (Glee)|Rachel]] ([[Lea Michele]]) and [[Puck (Glee)|Puck]] ([[Mark Salling]]) are reunited, a decision made by the producers due to the unexpected popularity of the pairing.

The episode features [[cover version]]s of five songs, all of which were released as [[Single (music)|singles]], available for [[Music download|digital download]], and two of which are included on the [[soundtrack album]] ''[[Glee: The Music, Volume 3 <U+2013> Showstoppers]]''. "Bad Reputation" was watched by 11.62 million American viewers and received mixed reviews from critics. Darren Franich of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and Bobby Hankinson of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' both considered it a return to form following disappointing episodes. Franich also praised the episode's cover version of "[[Ice Ice Baby]]" by [[Vanilla Ice]], which in contrast was criticized by Raymund Flandez of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and Gerrick D. Kennedy of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', with Kennedy deeming the performance his least favorite moment of the entire series thus far.

==Plot==
[[File:Molly Shannon at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival.JPG|thumb|135px|right|Molly Shannon makes her first appearance in "Bad Reputation" as Brenda Castle, an alcoholic astronomy teacher and badminton coach.]]
When [[glee club]] member [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]) steals a video of cheerleading coach [[Sue Sylvester]] ([[Jane Lynch]]) performing "[[Physical (Olivia Newton-John song)|Physical]]" by [[Olivia Newton-John]], the club members decide to post it on [[YouTube]] as a prank. Sue is mortified, and in retalliation gives [[Principal Figgins]] ([[Iqbal Theba]]) a list she has found, called a "glist", which ranks the glee club members based on a sexual promiscuity quotient. Figgins tells club director [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]) that he must either find the creator of the list, or he will be forced to disband the glee club and suspend all of its members. Will reprimands the club members, and for their weekly club assignment, he has the students find songs with bad reputations and rehabilitate them, performing [[Vanilla Ice]]'s "[[Ice Ice Baby]]" as an example.

Sue is ridiculed by her co-workers regarding her appearance in the video, and makes an enemy of her new colleague, alcoholic Brenda Castle ([[Molly Shannon]]). Sue is reminded by her sister Jean (Robin Trocki), who has [[Down Syndrome]], that when they were hurt as children they would volunteer at an animal shelter as a reminder there was always someone less fortunate than themselves. In light of her sister's advice, Sue decides to act as a therapist to school [[guidance counselor]] [[Emma Pillsbury]] ([[Jayma Mays]]), informing her that Will has been unfaithful to her. Emma confronts Will in the teachers' lounge, publicly shaming him.

Glee club members Kurt, [[Mercedes Jones|Mercedes]] ([[Amber Riley]]), [[Artie Abrams|Artie]] ([[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]]) and [[Tina Cohen-Chang|Tina]] ([[Jenna Ushkowitz]]) are upset over not being included on the list, while [[Brittany (Glee)|Brittany]] ([[Heather Morris (Glee actress)|Heather Morris]]) is aghast at not being listed among the top three. They perform a rendition of "[[U Can't Touch This]]" in the school library to cause a disruption in the hope of earning a bad reputation. Their plan backfires, and the librarian asks them to perform at her church's Sunday service. Next, Kurt confesses to Sue that he is the one who stole her video. Prior to his confession, however, Sue is contacted by Olivia Newton-John, who requests her help re-making the "Physical" video. As a result, Sue actually thanks Kurt for his actions. The song's re-release gains Sue a position in the top 700 recording artists, ending the ridicule by her colleagues. She donates her share of the profits to her sister's residential care facility.

After apologizing to Emma and presenting her with flowers, Will sees a depressed-looking [[Quinn Fabray|Quinn]] ([[Dianna Agron]]) in the hallway and suspects that she is responsible for the list. He confronts Quinn, who confesses. To prevent her from being suspended, Will lies to Figgins that no culprit has been found, but convinces him that as no new lists have been posted, they should drop the matter.

Rachel asks Puck to assist her in their glee assignment, creating a video for "[[Run Joey Run]]". Unbeknownst to each of them until the video is completed, she also has [[Finn Hudson|Finn]] ([[Cory Monteith]]) and [[Jesse St. James|Jesse]] ([[Jonathan Groff]]) playing the role of her boyfriend. They are offended to see they were all playing the same role and were edited in at different points during the video. Puck and Finn become angry, and Jesse breaks up with Rachel as a result. The episode closes with Rachel singing a rendition of "[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]" as the club members leave the classroom.

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, "Bad Reputation" was watched by 11.62 million American viewers, and attained a 4.9/13 [[Nielsen ratings#Ratings/share and total viewers|rating/share]] in the [[Nielsen ratings#Demographics|18-49 demographic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/05/05/broadcast-finals-tuesday-idol-lost-90210-adjusted-up-good-wife-v-parenthood-adjusted-down/50683|title=Broadcast Finals Tuesday: Idol, Lost, 90210 Adjusted Up; Good Wife, V, Parenthood Adjusted Down |last=Gorman|first=Bill|date=May 5, 2010|work=TV by the Numbers|accessdate=May 6, 2010}}</ref> It received mixed reviews from critics. Darren Franich of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the episode, writing that while there had been a "self-congratulatory quality" to ''Glee'' since its mid-season break, "Bad Reputation" was a return to "the ''Glee'' [he] fell in tormented love with." He graded the songs performed "C-" through to "A-", commending what he deemed "by far the greatest performance of "Ice Ice Baby" ever".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20361194_20366491.html|title='Glee' recap: Every Now and Then I Fall Apart|last=Franich|first=Darren|date=May 5, 2010|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref> The ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''{{'s}} Bobby Hankinson also felt the episode was a return to form. He praised the decision not to "apply meaningless rules to their musical selections", writing: "The freedom to not have to use songs by one artist let the storylines take priority, and not sticking to songs that share a common lyrical theme kept those choices from feeling too forced."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.chron.com/tubular/archives/2010/05/glee_gets_physi.html|title=Glee: Gets physical with Olivia Newton-John, totally eclipses last week  |last=Hankinson|first=Bobby|date=May 5, 2010|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref> Dave Itzkoff of the ''[[New York Times]]'' recapped the episode positively, describing it as: "pack[ing] more camp into an hour's worth of television than most kids will get all summer."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/05/glee-takes-a-spring-camp-trip/|title=<U+2018>Glee<U+2019> Takes a Spring Camp Trip |last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=May 5, 2010|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref> Todd VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.

Raymund Flandez of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' criticized most of the musical performances in the episode, calling "Run Joey Run" the highlight of an otherwise "slow, forced show". Flandez opined of "Ice Ice Baby": "Will, kicking it old school, doesn't cut it with his '80s-flashback moves because a.) he takes himself too seriously and b.) he looks like he's in a [[J.Crew]] mag, not part of [[2 Live Crew]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/05/05/glee-season-1-episode-17-bad-reputation-tv-recap/|title=<U+2018>Glee<U+2019> Season 1, Episode 17 <U+2018>Bad Reputation<U+2019>: TV Recap |last=Flandez|first=Raymund|date=May 5, 2010|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref> Gerrick D. Kennedy of the ''[[Los Angeles]]'' times wrote that he hated the episode, similarly calling "Run Joey Run" his favorite song, but noting that that was "not hard considering the songbook that was offered". Kennedy deemed the "Ice Ice Baby" performance his least favourite moment of the entire series thus far. He concluded: "Each of the musical numbers felt about two minutes longer than they should have been. I love Newton-John<U+2019>s walk-on cameo, but I don<U+2019>t want them to fall into the habit of re-creating music videos frame by frame: It was cute - once. It sounds harsh, but I could have completely done without the episode. It was almost as if they needed filler just to showcase the "Physical" video."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/05/glee-how-to-avoid-a-bad-reputation.html|title='Glee': How (not) to avoid a 'bad reputation' |last=Kennedy|first=Gerrick D.|date=May 5, 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>
