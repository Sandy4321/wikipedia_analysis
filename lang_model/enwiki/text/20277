; {{visible anchor|VL builds|VL Builds}}
: VL builds work with VLKs (volume license keys). Volume license keys can be used to activate multiple installations of the software without any mechanism (such as a [[product activation]] mechanism) checking the total number of installations. The license for the software will place restrictions on the use of the key. Typically, the license will limit the key to a fixed number of installations which must only be within the licensee's organization and also place the licensee under an obligation to keep a record of the number of installations, keep the key confidential and possibly even require that the licensee organization makes itself available for a software licensing audit to verify that its use of the key is within the terms of the license.

== Upgrade editions ==
Windows Vista Service Pack 1 can be upgraded to Windows 7 with an in-place upgrade if the processor architecture, comparable edition, and language version are the same.<ref name="ExtremeTech"/><ref name="supersite"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.techarp.com/showarticle.aspx?artno=609&pgno=1 |title= The Microsoft Windows 7 Upgrade Program Rev. 2.0 | publisher = [[Tech ARP]] | date = February 10, 2009 | accessdate =February 10, 2009 }}</ref> Earlier versions than Windows Vista Service Pack 1 can only be upgraded to Windows 7 via a clean install.<ref name="ExtremeTech"/><ref name="supersite"/><ref name="zdnet"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2009/02/05/windows_xp_7_vista_upgrade/ | title = Windows 7 'upgrade' doesn't mark XP spot |date = February 5, 2009 | accessdate=February 12, 2009 | last = Fiveash | first = Kelly | work = Channel Register | publisher = The Register }}</ref> However, in some countries, Microsoft has recommended a clean install regardless of whether going from XP or Vista, with reasoning that has not been made clear.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://emea.microsoftstore.com/UK/Microsoft/Windows/Windows-7/?WT.mc_id=MSCOMUK_HomePage_Buy_Windowstab | title = Party with Windows 7 <U+2013> Your PC with Windows 7 <U+2013> easier, faster, safer | publisher = Microsoft | accessdate =September 14, 2009}}</ref>

=== Standard upgrade editions ===
<!---NOTE:When editing this section please do not refer to the reader.-->
Windows 7 supports upgrading from an applicable version of XP and Vista to an applicable version of Windows 7 via Upgrade Editions, however there is no direct way to upgrade earlier than Windows Vista Service Pack 1. Users can upgrade to Vista first then to Windows 7 or use [[Windows Easy Transfer]] to collect data and settings from installed programs, install Windows 7 then install their program data and settings from Windows Easy Transfer, then re-install all their programs. Not all programs will install if they don't support Windows 7. The latter method does a fresh install of Windows 7 so all software needs to be re-installed. If the original hardware is kept, suitable drivers will need to be found. The options mean that users can update freely from any previous version to any of the new three retail editions of Windows 7: Home Premium, Professional, or Ultimate (plus in Europe, and possibly South Korea, these Upgrade Editions also come in optional N versions). Discounted upgrade pricing is only available to current users of [[Windows Genuine Advantage|genuine]] copies XP or Vista.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://emea.microsoftstore.com/UK/Microsoft/Windows/Windows-7/?WT.mc_id=MSCOMUK_HomePage_Buy_Windowstab | title=Microsoft Store UK <U+2013> Windows 7 | accessdate =September 14, 2009}}</ref>

=== Standard upgrade editions (Family Packs) ===
Windows 7 is available as an ''Upgrade'' Family Pack edition in certain markets, to upgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium only. It gives licenses to upgrade three machines from Vista or Windows XP to the Windows 7 Home Premium edition. These are not full versions, so each machine to be upgraded must have one of these qualifying previous versions of Windows for them to work.<ref>[http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windows7/archive/2009/07/31/windows-anytime-upgrade-and-family-pack-pricing.aspx steam blog, dated 2009/07/31], accessed September 16, 2009.</ref> In the United States, this offer was discontinued in early December 2009.<ref>[http://www.informationweek.com/news/windows/operatingsystems/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=222001027 Windows 7 Family Pack Discontinued]</ref> Microsoft has since announced it will resume availability of Windows 7 Home Premium Family Pack which will be available starting October 3, 2010 for a limited time while supplies last.<ref>[http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/windowsexperience/archive/2010/09/01/family-pack-returns-in-time-for-the-anniversary-of-windows-7.aspx Family Pack returns in time for the Anniversary of Windows 7]</ref>

==Upgrade compatibility==
There are two possible ways to upgrade to Windows 7 from an earlier version of Windows:

* An in-place install (labelled "Upgrade" in the installer), where settings and programs are preserved from an older version of Windows. This option is only sometimes available, depending on the editions of Windows being used, and is not available at all unless upgrading from Windows Vista.<ref>{{cite web |
url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd772579%28WS.10%29.aspx |
title=Windows 7 Upgrade Paths | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=September 13, 2011}}</ref>
* A clean install (labelled "Custom" in the installer). This option is always available.

The table below lists which upgrade paths allow for an in-place install. Note that in-place upgrades can only be performed when the previous version of Windows is of the same architecture. If upgrading from a 32-bit installation to a 64-bit installation or vice versa, a clean install is mandatory regardless of the editions being used.

=== Anytime Upgrade editions ===
Windows 7 also supports in-place upgrades from a lower edition of Windows 7 to a higher one using the [[Windows Anytime Upgrade]] tool.<ref name="ExtremeTech"/> There are currently three retail options available (though it is currently unclear whether they can be used with previous installations of the N versions).<ref name='Amazon UK'>{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss?url=search-alias%3Dsoftware&field-keywords=windows+7+anytime+upgrade&x=0&y=0 | title = Windows Anytime Upgrades | accessdate =September 14, 2009 | publisher = [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]}}</ref> Currently, there are no plans for family pack versions of the Anytime Upgrade editions.
