'''''Darlingtonia californica''''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|d|<U+0251>r|l|<U+026A>|<U+014B>|<U+02C8>|t|o<U+028A>|n|i|<U+0259>|_|k|<U+00E6>|l|<U+0268>|<U+02C8>|f|<U+0254>r|n|<U+0268>|k|<U+0259>}}), also called the '''California [[pitcher plant]]''', '''cobra lily''', or '''cobra plant''', is a [[species]] of [[carnivorous plant]], the sole member of the [[genus]] ''Darlingtonia'' in the [[family (biology)|family]] Sarraceniaceae. It is [[native plant|native]] to Northern California and Oregon, growing in bogs and seeps with cold running water. This plant is designated as uncommon due to its rarity in the field.<ref>[http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/interchange/I_treat_indexes.html The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California]</ref>

The name "cobra lily" stems from the resemblance of its tubular [[Leaf|leaves]] to a rearing [[cobra]], complete with a forked leaf - ranging from yellow to purplish-green - that resemble fangs or a serpent's tongue.

The plant was discovered in 1841 by the botanist [[William D. Brackenridge]] at [[Mount Shasta]]. In 1853 it was described by [[John Torrey]], who named the genus ''Darlingtonia'' after the Philadelphian botanist [[William Darlington]] (1782<U+2013>1863).

==Biology==
[[Image:Darlingtonia californica ne8.JPG|thumb|left|Note the small entrance to the trap underneath the swollen 'balloon', and the colourless patches that confuse prey trapped inside]]

The cobra lily is not only restricted to nutrient-poor acidic bogs and seepage slopes, but many colonies actually thrive in [[ultramafic rock|ultramafic]] soils, which are in fact basic soils, within its range. In common with most carnivorous plants, the cobra lily is adapted to supplementing its nitrogen requirements through carnivory, which helps to compensate for the lack of available nitrogen in such habitats.

Because many carnivorous species live in hostile environments, their root systems are commonly as highly modified as their leaves. ''Darlingtonia californica'' is no exception. The cobra lily is able to survive fire by regenerating from its roots, but despite this important role the roots are very delicate organs. While the temperatures in much of the species's range can exceed 25 <U+00B0>C, their roots die back after exposure to temperatures not much higher than 10 <U+00B0>C. Temperature plays a large part in the functioning of all plants, but it is very rare for individual organs to have such different temperature tolerances. The physiological mechanisms and evolutionary benefits of this discrepancy are not fully understood.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/s11104-004-2754-2}}</ref>

The cobra lily is unique among the three genera of [[Sarraceniaceae|American pitcher plants]]. It does not trap rainwater in its pitcher. Instead, it regulates the level of water inside physiologically by releasing or absorbing water into the trap that has been pumped up from the roots. It was once believed that this variety of pitcher plant did not produce any digestive enzymes and relied on [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] bacteria and protozoa to break down the captured insects into easily absorbed nutrients. Recent studies have indicated that ''Darlingtonia'' secretes at least one [[proteolysis|proteolytic]] enzyme that digests captured prey.<ref>ISBN 0-88192-356-7 Carnivorous Plants of the World a. Pietropaolo p. 61</ref> The cells that absorb nutrients from the inside of the pitcher are the same as those on the roots that absorb soil nutrients. The efficiency of the plant's trapping ability is attested to by its leaves and pitchers, which are, more often than not, full of insects and their remains.<ref>ISBN 0-88192-356-7 Carnivorous Plants of the World a. Pietropaolo p. 58</ref>

In addition to the use of lubricating secretions and downward-pointing hairs common to all North American pitcher plants to force their prey into the trap, this species carefully hides the tiny exit hole from trapped insects by curling it underneath and offering multiple translucent false exits. Upon trying many times to leave via the false exits, the insect will tire and fall down into the trap. The slippery walls and hairs prevent the trapped prey from escaping. The only other species that utilizes this technique is the Parrot Pitcher Plant, ''[[Sarracenia psittacina]]''.

A remaining mystery surrounding the cobra lily is its means of [[pollination]]. Its [[flower]] is unusually shaped and complex, typically a sign of a close pollinator-plant specialization, but none have been identified. The flower is yellowish purple in color and grows on a stalk with a similar length to the stalk. It has five [[sepals]], green in color, which are longer than the red-veined petals. While pollination has not yet been observed in action, it is generally expected that the [[pollinator]] is either a fly attracted to the flower's unpleasant smell or some nocturnal insect, as no extensive study has been performed to observe potential nighttime pollinators.

==Cultivation==
[[Image:Darlingtonia californica02.jpg|thumb|left|Plants in cultivation]]

''Darlingtonia californica'' can be one of the most difficult carnivorous plants to keep in cultivation, but this depends on the area in which they are cultivated. They prefer cool to warm day-time temperatures and cold or cool night-time temperatures. The problem is that cobra lilies typically grow in [[bog]]s or streambanks that are fed by cold mountain water, and grow best when the [[root]]s are kept cooler than the rest of the plant. It is best to mimic these conditions in cultivation, and water the plants with cold, [[purified water]]. On hot days, it helps to place ice cubes of purified water on the [[soil]] surface. They prefer sunny conditions if in a [[Humidity|humid]], warm location, and prefer part-shade if humidity is low or fluctuates often. Plants can adapt to low humidity conditions, but optimum growth occurs under reasonable humidity.

Growing cobra lilies from [[seed]] is extremely slow and cobra [[Germination|seedlings]] are difficult to maintain, so these plants are best propagated from the long [[stolon]]s they grow in late winter and spring. When a minute cobra plant is visible at the end of the stolon (usually in mid to late spring), the whole stolon may be cut into sections a few inches long, each with a few [[root]]s attached. Lay these upon cool, moist, shredded [[Sphagnum|long-fibered sphagnum moss]] and place in a humid location with bright light. In many weeks, cobra plants will protrude from each section of stolon.

Like many other carnivorous plants of temperate regions, cobra lilies require a cold winter [[dormancy]] in order to live long-term. Plants die down to their [[rhizome]]s in frigid winters and will maintain their leaves in cool winters during their dormancy period. This period lasts from 3 to 5 months during the year, and all growth stops. As spring approaches, [[Sexual maturity|mature]] plants may send up a single, nodding [[flower]], and a few weeks later the plant will send up a few large [[Pitcher plant|pitchers]]. The plant will continue to produce pitchers throughout the summer, however much smaller than the early spring pitchers.

Many carnivorous plant enthusiasts have succeeded in cultivating these plants, and have developed or discovered three color morphs: all green, all red, and red-green bicolor.

Wild-type plants are all green in moderate light and bicolor in intense sunlight.

This plant has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].<ref>http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=4438</ref>
