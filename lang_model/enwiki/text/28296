The '''Marine Corps Brevet Medal''', also known as the '''Brevet Medal''', was a [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|military decoration]] of the [[United States Marine Corps]]; it was created in 1921 as a result of Marine Corps Order Number 26. The decoration was a one-time issuance and retroactively recognized living Marine Corps officers who had received a [[brevet (military)|brevet rank]]. The similar practice of [[frocking]] continues in all five branches of the [[U.S. Armed Forces]].

Brevet promotions were used by the United States military in some capacity from 1775 until they were discontinued in 1900.  The Army was the only branch authorized to grant brevets until 1814, when the Marine Corps was granted the same privilege.  For the 86 years, the Marine Corps awarded 121 brevet promotions to 100 Marine Corps officers.  Captain [[Anthony Gale]] was the first to receive a brevet promotion in 1814 and [[John Twiggs Myers]], who died in 1952, was the last surviving recipient.

In 1921 [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant]] [[John A. Lejeune]] requested that a Marine Corps Brevet Medal be authorized; after it was approved and created, the decoration was given to the last 21 living Marine Corps officers who received brevet promotions.

==Brevet promotions==
A brevet promotion or ''brevet'' is the advancement in rank without the advancement in either pay grade or position. Typically, a brevetted officer would be given the insignia of the brevetted rank, but not the pay or formal authority.  Brevet promotions were originally authorized for the United States Army in 1775 by the [[Second Continental Congress]]. In 1778 a resolution was passed stating brevets would only be authorized "..to officers in the line or in case of very eminent services...".<ref name=Gazette>{{cite journal|accessdate=July 23, 2009

The Marine Corps would not receive the authorization from Congress for brevet promotions until 1814 stating "... That the President is hereby authorized to confer brevet rank on such officers of the Marine Corps as shall distinguish themselves by gallant actions and meritorious conduct or shall have served ten years in any one grade...".<ref name=Gazette/>

In 1814 [[Anthony Gale]] became the first Marine to receive a brevet promotion when he was brevetted to Major, having been a Captain for ten years. By the time the practice of brevet promotions was discontinued in 1900, 121 brevet promotions were bestowed on 100 Marine Corps officers.<ref name=Gazette/>

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, brevet promotions were common in the United States armed forces. New officers received brevet rank until authorized positions were made available, or they could be brevetted to fill higher positions for gallantry. During the [[American Civil War]], most senior officers received a brevet promotion, particularly during the final months of the war.<ref name=MCLM>{{cite web|accessdate=July 23, 2009|url=http://www.mclm.com/gallery/brevet.html

After officers became eligible for the [[Medal of Honor]], a rare Marine Corps Brevet Medal was issued to living officers who had been brevetted between 1861 and 1915.<ref name=Gazette/>

Due to the establishment of the Medal of Honor and the change in rules allowing both officers and enlisted to receive it, the need for brevet promotions diminished. During the American Civil War, the Army used the issuing of brevet promotions to such a degree that Congress passed an act in 1869 that restricted the issuance of brevet promotions. The act established three requirements for awarding a brevet: "they could only be awarded in time of war and then only for distinguished conduct and public service in the presence of the enemy, and it also removed all privileges of command based upon brevet rank except as directed by the President."<ref name=Gazette/><ref name=Lellebook>{{cite book

In 1870 Congress passed a law stating that no officer could wear, nor be addressed by, their brevet rank making brevet promotions an honorary decoration only.<ref name=Gazette/> Because of this new law the last nine brevet promotions awarded by the Marine Corps occurred during the [[Boxer Rebellion]].  On June 7, 1921, the [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Edwin Denby (politician)|Edwin Denby]] approved then-[[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant]] [[John A. Lejeune]]'s request for a medal denoting the holder of a brevet promotion to be issued. Marine Corps Order #26 was issued on June 27, 1921, authorizing the medal to be ordered and by November 10, 1921 the medals had been created.<ref name=Gazette/><ref name=Lellebook/> This decoration was justified on the grounds that, until 1915, Marine Corps officers were not eligible for the Medal of Honor.<ref name=Lellebook/>

In 1940, because only one of the recipients was still alive ([[Smedley Butler]] had died in late June of that year), the Marine Corps declared the Brevet Medal obsolete.  The lone survivor, [[Major General]] [[John Twiggs Myers]], had been brevetted for valor at the siege of the U.S. embassy at Peking (the [[Battle of Peking]]), in 1900.  He died in 1952 in [[Coconut Grove, Florida]], and the medal was never issued again.  The concept of brevet commissions was phased out of the [[United States military]], and was be replaced by temporary and [[Battlefield commission|field promotions]], which were awarded more frequently than brevet ranks.<ref name=Lellebook/>

Twenty-three men received this award, of whom three received both the Marine Corps Brevet Medal and the Medal of Honor.<ref name=Lellebook/>

==Description and symbolism==
The Marine Corps Brevet Medal was considered to be the equivalent of the [[Navy Cross]], although in precedence it ranks just behind the [[Medal of Honor]]. Recipients of the medal had received field commissions as Marine Corps officers, under combat conditions, and had performed feats of distinction and gallant service.  Initially, the Brevet Medal ranked behind the Navy Distinguished Service Medal and was issued to 23 active, retired, and discharged Marine Corps personnel.<ref name=Lellebook/>

The medal was designed by Sergeant Joseph Alfred Burnett and contained a ribbon, in USMC scarlet, closely resembling the blue-and-white starred pattern of the Medal of Honor.  No attached devices for the Brevet Medal were authorized.<ref name=Lellebook/>

===Front of Medal===
The Medal consists of a bronze cross patt<U+00E9>e, with the center of each arm extended in a [[Semicircle|semi-circular]] shape and in the center of the front is the word "BREVET", encircled by the words "UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS". A small five-pointed star, point-up, is at the bottom center of the circle formed by the inscription and a small Marine Corps insignia ([[Eagle, Globe, and Anchor|eagle, globe and anchor]]) attaches the medal to its suspension ring.<ref name=Lellebook/>

===Back of Medal===
The back of the Medal is plain except for its center, which contains the inscription "FOR DISTINGUISHED CONDUCT" in a circle, and the words "IN PRESENCE OF ENEMY" in the center. The original medals were neither named nor numbered.<ref name=Lellebook/>
