'''Elwyn Roy King''' [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (13 May 1894 &ndash; 28 November 1941) was a [[fighter pilot]] and [[flying ace|ace]] in the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) during [[World War I]]. He scored twenty-six victories in aerial combat, making him the fourth highest-scoring Australian aviator of the war. King entered service as a [[Australian Light Horse|Lighthorseman]] in 1915, before transferring to the AFC in 1917. Operating with [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;4 Squadron]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], he achieved seven of his "kills" in the [[Sopwith Snipe]], more than any other pilot. His exploits earned him the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and the [[Distinguished Service Order]]. Returning to Australia in 1919, King went into business before joining the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] following the outbreak of [[World War II]]. He held several training commands prior to his sudden death in November 1941, at the age of forty-seven.

==Early life==
Elwyn Roy King was born on 13 May 1894 at The Grove, near [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[New South Wales]]. He was the son of English-born Elizabeth Mary (Miller) King and Richard King, an Australian laborer. Elwyn attended public school, and further educated himself in mechanical engineering via correspondence. Having been employed repairing bicycles, automobiles, and farming equipment, he was working as a motor mechanic in [[Forbes, New South Wales|Forbes]] when he joined the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] under the name Roy King on 20 July 1915.<ref name="ADB">{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |last=Fraser|first=Alan|year=2000|id=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150028b.htm|title=King, Elwyn Roy (1894 - 1941)|accessdate=4 November 2008}}</ref><ref name="AIF">[http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8080/showPerson?pid=165685 Roy King] at [http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8080/index.html The AIF Project].

==World War I==
===Early service===
Embarking for Egypt aboard HMAT ''Themistocles'' on 5 October 1915, King became a member of the [[Australian Mounted Division|12th Light Horse]] in February 1916.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="AIF"/> The unit was engaged in the defence of [[Suez Canal]] in May, and spent the following months undertaking patrols and sorties into the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai Desert]].<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_10571.asp 12th Light Horse Regiment] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 26 December 2009.</ref> 

King transferred to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) on 13 January 1917, and was sent to Britain to join No. 68 (Australian) Squadron of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (later [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No. 4 Squadron AFC]]) as an air mechanic on 18 April. He was posted to a training squadron for flying instruction in August.<ref name="Garrison">Garrison, ''Australian Fighter Aces'', p.93</ref> On 15 October, he gained his [[Flying badge|wings]] and was commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]].<ref name="AIF"/><ref name="Garrison"/> Rejoining No. 4 Squadron in November, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant]] on 15 January 1918,<ref name="AIF"/><ref name="Garrison"/> before arriving in France for active duty on 21 March.<ref name="ADB"/>

===Fighter ace===
No. 4 Squadron initially flew its [[Sopwith Camel]]s in support of Australian ground troops, meaning that King and his fellow pilots were engaged in hazardous low-level work, with little opportunity for air-to-air combat. The burly six-foot, three-inch King&mdash;nicknamed "Bo" or "Beau"&mdash;also had problems landing the Camel; his large frame crammed into its small cockpit impeded control stick movement. The resulting rough landings annoyed his [[Commanding Officer]], [[Major]] Wilfred McCloughry, brother of ace [[Edgar McCloughry]].<ref name="ADB"/><ref>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |last=Fraser|first=Alan|year=1986|id=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100220b.htm|title=McCloughry, Wilfred Ashton (1894 - 1943)|accessdate=26 December 2009}}</ref> On 14 May 1918, King sent a two-seat German scout out of control, but clouds prevented him from confirming its destruction.<ref>Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/20.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p.282]</ref> By 20 May, however, he had been credited with his first aerial victory, over a [[Pfalz D.III|Pfalz&nbsp;D.III]] near [[Kemmelberg|Kemmel]]-[[Neuve-<U+00C9>glise|Neuve <U+00C9>glise]].<ref name="Garrison"/><ref name="Newton">Newton, ''Australian Air Aces'', p.43</ref> The following month he shot down his first balloon and two more aircraft, a Pfalz and an [[LVG]], in the vicinity of the [[Leie|Lys]].<ref name="Garrison"/><ref>Cutlack, ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp.288&ndash;290</ref>

On 29&nbsp;July, King led a flight of six Camels from No. 4 Squadron escorting [[Royal Air Force]] [[Airco DH.9|DH.9]] light bombers in a raid on [[Armenti<U+00E8>res]]. In an action that the [[Official History of Australia in the War of 1914<U+2013>1918|official history of Australia in the war]] highlighted as an "example of cool and skilful air fighting", the DH.9s completed their bombing mission while the Camels drove off an attacking force of at least ten German [[Fokker]]s, three of the Australians including King claiming victories, without any Allied loss.<ref>Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/21.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p.303]</ref> King scored two victories, a balloon and an LVG, near [[Estaires]] during a bombing raid on 10 August.<ref>Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/24.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp.340&ndash;341]</ref> On 16&nbsp;August, as part of the Allies' [[Hundred Days Offensive]], he participated in another raid, a major assault against the German airfield at [[Haubourdin]], near [[Lille]], that resulted in thirty-seven enemy aircraft being destroyed. During the action, described by the official history as a "riot of destruction", King set on fire a hanger housing four or five German planes.<ref>Cutlack, ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp.346&ndash;349</ref> He was recommended for the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) on 8 September. The award, promulgated in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 3 December, cited his "gallant and valuable service in bombing and attacking with machine gun fire enemy billets, trains, troops etc", during which "he insures success by descending to low altitudes, disregarding personal danger".<ref>{{LondonGazette|supp=yes|issue=31046|startpage=14323|date=3 December 1918|accessdate=26 December 2009}}</ref>  On 15 September, King was promoted to [[Captain (land)|Captain]] and [[Flight (military unit)|flight commander]], and by the end of the month had taken his score to eighteen.<ref name="AIF"/><ref name="Newton"/>  He registered his final victory in a Camel on 2 October when he sent down his fourth balloon by unloading his bombs on it.<ref name="Garrison"/><ref name="Newton"/> He then converted with the rest of No. 4 Squadron to the upgraded [[Sopwith Snipe]], whose larger cockpit was a better fit for him.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="4Sqn">[http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_10842.asp 4 Squadron AFC] at Australian War Memorial.

King scored with the Snipe on both 28 and 29 October, the latter at [[Tournai]], in what is frequently described as "one of the greatest air battles of the war".<ref>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.21</ref><ref name="Odgers">Odgers, ''Air Force Australia'', pp. 42&ndash;43</ref><ref name="Cutlack pp.376<U+2013>379">Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/26.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp.376&ndash;379]</ref> Amid a confrontation involving over seventy-five Allied and German fighters, King evaded five enemy Fokkers that dived on him, before destroying an LVG in a head-on attack. The next day, he downed three [[Fokker D.VII]]s, two without having to fire a shot. As he zoomed up from shooting one down out of control, he cut off another. This second Fokker pulled up to avoid collision and toppled on top of a third Fokker.<ref name="Cutlack pp.376<U+2013>379"/> 4 November brought one of the war's last air battles, near [[Leuze, Aisne|Leuze]].

Little]] and [[Roderic Dallas]], flew with the British [[Royal Naval Air Service]] and Royal Air Force).<ref name="Newton"/><ref>Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', pp.30<U+2013>31</ref> King was recommended for a [[Medal bar|bar]] to his DFC that was upgraded to the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and awarded on 3 June 1919.<ref>{{LondonGazette|supp=yes|issue=31378|startpage=7030|date=3 June 1919|accessdate=26 December 2009}}</ref> The recommendation noted his victories in the air and cited him for having "proved himself a very brilliant patrol leader" and for being "a magnificant example at all times to all pilots in the squadron".<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM28/2/120/0012.pdf Recommendation: Bar to Distinguished Flying Cross] at Australian War Memorial.

==Interregnum and World War II==

Following the end of hostilities, No. 4 Squadron joined the British Army of Occupation in [[Bickendorf]], near [[Cologne]], Germany, in December 1918. The unit returned to England in March 1919, and King sailed with it back to Australia on 6 May.<ref name="AIF"/><ref name="4Sqn"/> He left the AFC on 11 August 1919 in [[Melbourne]], before taking up employment with Larkin-Sopwith Aviation Company of Australasia Limited, racking up a number of commercial aviation firsts transporting mail, newspapers, and press photos. In 1920, he refused to join the newly established Australian Air Corps&mdash;forerunner of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF)&mdash;because it had not then offered a commission to [[Frank Hubert McNamara|Frank McNamara]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]]. King soon left aviation to go into business with another pilot, founding Shipman, King, and Company Pty Limited. Importing and manufacturing machinery, the company was successful and King was able to take up motor racing. On 31 March 1925, he married twenty year-old Josephine Vida Livingston in Melbourne. They would have a son and a daughter.<ref name="ADB"/> 

In December 1939, soon after the outbreak of [[World War II|World War&nbsp;II]], King joined the RAAF as a [[Squadron Leader]]. Initially offered flying duties, he was transferred to command pilot training in the new year.<ref name="ADB"/> On 2&nbsp;January 1940, he became the inaugural [[Commanding officer|Commanding Officer]] of No.&nbsp;3 Elementary Flying Training School (3EFTS) in [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]], Victoria. Part of the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]], 3EFTS initially comprised a significant civilian presence, many of the aircraft and staff under King's control being from private airline companies and the [[Royal Victorian Aero Club]]; by July, however, all private machines had been pressed into RAAF service and the civilian element largely ceased.<ref>RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.18&ndash;19</ref> King took over No. 5 Elementary Flying Training School at [[Narromine, New South Wales|Narromine]], New South Wales, on 21&nbsp;December.<ref>RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.22&ndash;23</ref> Promoted to [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]], he led No.&nbsp;1 Service Flying Training School at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF_Williams_Point_Cook_Base|RAAF Point Cook]] from 7&nbsp;July 1941,<ref>RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.100&ndash;101</ref> before being posted in October to command the newly established Station Headquarters Point Cook, as a [[Group Captain]]. King died unexpectedly of [[cerebral edema|cerebral oedema]] on 28 November. He was survived by his wife and children, and cremated.<ref name="ADB"/> His funeral at [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]] was attended by hundreds of mourners from the military and civil aviation world, including the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], [[Air Chief Marshal]] [[Charles Burnett (RAF officer)|Sir Charles Burnett]], and a representative of the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Air]]; the pallbearers included [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Henry Wrigley]], [[Air Commodore]] [[Raymond Brownell]], and three Group Captains.<ref>{{cite journal | date = 1 December 1941 | title = Funeral of Group-Capt.
