'''Secret trusts in English law''' are a class of [[English trusts law|trust]] defined as an unofficial arrangement between a [[testator]] and a [[trustee]], made to come into force after death, that aims to benefit a person without having been written in a will. Normally, the property would be given to the trustee in the will, and he would then be expected to pass it on to the real [[beneficiary]]. There are two types of secret trust <U+2014> fully secret and half-secret <U+2014> with different rules for each. A fully secret trust is one with no mention in the will whatsoever. For these to be valid, the person seeking to enforce the trust must prove that the testator intended to form a trust, that this intention was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee accepted his office. Similar provisions are required for a half-secret trust, which is where there is a mention of the trust in the testator's will, but not of the trust's terms.

Because secret trusts are not found in wills, they should technically fall foul of the [[Wills Act 1837]], and be invalid. Despite this, the courts have chosen to uphold them as valid. Various justifications have been given for this; the traditional one is that if the courts do not recognise secret trusts, the trustee given the property in the will would be able to keep it, committing fraud. A more modern view is that secret trusts exist outside the will altogether, and thus do not have to comply with it. This debate is of importance when classifying the trust; if the traditional theory is correct, secret trusts are created by the courts, and thus [[Constructive trusts in English law|constructive trusts]]. If the more modern view is correct, the trusts exist without the court's permission, and are express trusts.

==Definition==

A secret trust is an unofficial arrangement between a [[testator]] and a [[trustee]] to benefit a person without having to specify that person in a will. Essentially, the trustee is given something in the will which he is then expected to give to the "real" beneficiary.<ref name=hud269/> Interestingly, these trusts are invalid under statute; Section 9 of the [[Wills Act 1837]] provides that a will is only valid when: {{quote|(a) it is in writing, and signed by the testator, or by some other person in his presence and by his direction; and <br> (b) it appears that the testator intended by his signature to give effect to the will; and <br> (c) the signature is made or acknowledged by the testator in the presence of two or more witnesses present at the same time; and <br> (d) each witness either - <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;(i) attests and signs the will; or <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) acknowledges his signature, in the presence of the testator (but not necessarily in the presence of any other witnesses).<ref name=hud269>Hudson (2009) p.269</ref>}}
As such, such trusts are not enforceable because they are invalid. Equity has been willing to accept their validity in the [[common law]] to prevent the trustee committing fraud and keeping the property;<ref name=hud269/> justifications for this acceptance are debated.<ref>Hudson (2009) p.289-91</ref> The courts recognise two forms of secret trust, each with their own rules. Fully secret trusts are trusts not referred to at all in the will, with the agreement made elsewhere. Half-secret trusts are trusts mentioned in some form in the will; its existence is disclosed, but not the terms.<ref>Hudson (2009) p.270</ref> [[Alastair Hudson]], Professor of Equity and Law at [[Queen Mary, University of London]], suggests the potential for a third class of secret trust. This is where the dying person is encouraged not to make a will so that his property passes to the next-of-kin, on the agreement that the next-of-kin give effect to his wishes via a secret trust. If this is the case, the next-of-kin would be obliged to hold the property on trust and fulfil the dying person's wishes.<ref>Hudson (2009) p.271</ref>

The secret trust was originally conceived to prevent fraud enabled by statute or the common law, in line with the [[equitable maxim]] that "equity will not allow a statute to be used as a cloak for fraud". In ''[[McCormic v Grogan]]'',<ref>(1869) LR 4 HL 82</ref> [[Richard Bethell, 1st Baron Westbury|Lord Westbury]] justified secret trusts, saying: {{quote|the court has, from a very early period, decided that even an Act of Parliament shall not be used as an instrument as fraud; and that equity will fasten on the individual who gets a title under that Act, and impose upon him a personal obligation, because he applies the Act as an instrument for accomplishing a fraud. In this way, a court of equity has dealt with the Statute of Frauds, and in this manner, also, it deals with the Statute of Wills.<ref>Hudson (2009) p.273</ref>}}

==Fully secret trusts==
Fully secret trusts are awkward because of the lack of knowledge; it becomes difficult to prove fraud. In ''[[Ottaway v Norman]]'',<ref>[1972] 2 WLR 50</ref> [[John Brightman, Baron Brightman|Brightman J]] set out the test for proving the existence of a fully secret trust. This is: {{quote|It will be convenient to call the person on whom such a trust is imposed the 'primary donee', and the beneficiary under that trust the 'secondary donee'. The essential elements which must be proved to exist are: (i) the intention of the testator to subject the primary donee to an obligation in favour of the secondary donee; (ii) communication of that intention to the primary donee; and (iii) the acceptance of that obligation by the primary donee either expressly or by acquiescence. It is immaterial whether these elements precede or succeed the will of the donor.<ref>Hudson (2009) p.275</ref>}}
For a fully secret trust to be valid, therefore, it must be proved that there was intention, that this was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee accepted his obligations. Intention is one of the [[three certainties]], and applies to fully secret trusts in the same way as it does to other express trusts. There are additional rules that only apply to secret trusts; in ''[[Re Snowden]]'',<ref>[1979] 2 All ER 172</ref> it was decided that where all the deceased intended was to impose a moral obligation on the trustee, that will not be enough to create a secret trust.<ref>Hudson (2009) p.276</ref>

The second requirement is that both the secret trust and its terms are communicated to the trustee. This may be done at any point prior to death; without it, the secret trust is void. Exactly what must be communicated depends on the nature of the property and trust; if there are multiple beneficiaries for example, this will need to be communicated. In ''[[Re Boyes]]'',<ref>(1884) 26 Ch D 531</ref> Kay J came to the conclusion that communication requires allowing the trustee the chance to refuse his office; as such, it cannot be done after death.<ref>Hudson (2009) p.277</ref> Lastly, the office of trustee must be accepted by the trustee. The two ways this can be done were laid out by Wood VC in ''[[Wallgrave v Tebbs]]'',<ref>(1855) 25 LJ Ch 241</ref> when he said: {{quote|Where a person, knowing that a testator is making a disposition in his favour intends it to be applied for purposes other than his own benefit, either expressly promises, or by silence implies, that he will carry on the testator's intention into effect, and the property is left to him upon the faith of that promise or understanding, it is in effect a case of trust".<ref>Hudson (2009) p.278</ref>}}
Acceptance, therefore, can be communicated in one of two ways; either by the trustee directly stating his acceptance, or by implying it through not declining.<ref>Hudson (2009) p.279</ref>

==Half-secret trusts==
The requirements for a half-secret trust to be valid are similar to those for fully secret trusts, and were laid out in ''[[Blackwell v Blackwell]]'',<ref>[1929] AC 318</ref> where a testator gave five trustees pieces of property, instructing them (in the will) to hold on to this property as they had been asked. Prior to the testator's death, the trustees had all been told what to do with the property.<ref>{{cite journal|last=P.|first=J.A.|year=1928|title=Wills. Trust. Expressed in Will. Re Blackwell; Blackwell v. Blackwell. [1928] W. N. 12. 97 L. J. Ch. 92|journal=The Cambridge Law Journal|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=3|issue=2|issn=0008-1973}}</ref> Lord Sumner said that: {{quote|The necessary elements [to create a half-secret trust], on which the question turns, are intention, communication and acquiescence. The testator intends his absolute gift to be employed as he and not as the donee desires; he tells the proposed donee of this intention and, either by express promise or by the tacit promise, which is satisfied by acquiescence, the proposed donee encourages him to bequeath the money on the faith that his intention will be carried out.<ref>Hudson (2009) p.280</ref>}}
Communication must be either at or before the execution of the will; Sumner also held in ''Blackwell'' that "[a] testator cannot reserve to himself a power of making future unwitnessed dispositions by merely naming a trustee and leaving the purposes of the trust to be supplied afterwards". This is because for the trustee to be able to agree to the trust, he must know the full terms. Acceptance of the half-secret trust is again similar to fully secret trusts; it can be communicated either directly, or tacitly.<ref>Hudson (2009) p.281</ref>

==Practice==
There are a variety of practical rules in these trusts' use, which span both fully secret and half-secret trusts. If a testator alters the terms of the trust or the trust property, he must inform the intended trustee; if not, as in ''[[Re Colin Cooper]]'',<ref>[1939] 3 All ER 586</ref> the trustee will be permitted to keep the newly added property. Where the trustees are co-owners of the property, informing them of the trust's terms or amendments becomes complicated. If they hold the property as [[Joint_tenancy#Tenancy_in_common|tenants-in-common]], only those tenants who were informed of the trust are bound to follow it. Where they hold the property as [[Joint_tenancy#Joint_tenancy|joint tenants]], they are all bound by the trust if even one tenant accepts it before the testator's death. Where they hold the property as joint tenants and some accept it, but only after the testator's death, only those who accepted it are bound. This area has been called "rather illogical".<ref>Edwards (2007) p.120</ref>

Evidential issues also exist. Because secret trusts are by definition secret, they are difficult to prove in court. The [[parol evidence rule]] states that where there is written evidence, oral testimony cannot be introduced to the court if it contradicts that evidence. Since secret trusts are oral and normally exist outside of the will (a written document) this causes problems. In ''[[Re Keen]]'',<ref>[1937] Ch 236</ref> the issue came up, and the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] decided that the parol evidence rule extended to secret trusts, and such trusts could not be enforced if they contradicted written documents. More generally, the problem is proving that the testator intended to create a trust. As in ''McCormic v Grogan'', the standard is high; the person trying to enforce the trust must show "most clearly and distinctly" that it exists.<ref>Hudson (2009) p.285-6</ref>

==Justification and classification==
Because secret trusts are (by their very nature) not mentioned in wills, they should technically fall foul of the [[Wills Act 1837]]. There are various theories on how to justify secret trusts, and whether to classify them as express trusts or [[constructive trusts in English law|constructive trusts]]. The traditional one is that it is a mechanism to prevent fraud by statute. Under this rule, secret trusts would be constructive trusts; the reason they do not have to follow the Wills Act 1837 is because they are created by the courts.<ref name=ed121/> This is a difficult argument with which to justify half-secret trusts, because since the will mentions the trust, fraud is not directly possible.<ref name=ed121>Edwards (2007) p.121</ref> In addition, [[Alastair Hudson]] submits that this argument is significantly flawed. It suggests that liability for the property comes about from fraud; in actual fact, liability comes about as soon as the trustee accepts the property to hold on trust, and so the fraud theory is not necessary to bind the trustee's hands.<ref>Hudson (2009) p.289</ref>

A more modern argument is that secret trusts are independent and operate outside the will.<ref>Edwards (2007) p.122</ref> The trust was created by the donor and trustee during the donor's life, and simply not constituted until his death; it does not have to follow the Wills Act, because it was not created by a will. This view was expressed by [[Robert Megarry|Megarry VC]] in ''[[Re Snowden]]'',<ref>[1970] 1 Ch 700</ref> where he said "The whole basis of secret trusts...is that they operate outside the will, changing nothing that is written in it, and allowing it to operate according to its tenor, but then fastening a trust on to the property in the hands of the recipient". This suggests that secret trusts are not constructive trusts but rather express trusts.<ref>Hudson (2009) p.290</ref> A third view is that fully secret and half-secret trusts should be "split" and analysed differently from each other. Fully secret trusts are constructive trusts, because they exist to prevent fraud. Half-secret trusts are not, because their mention in wills makes fraud unlikely; they are instead express trusts.<ref>Hudson (2009) p.291</ref>
