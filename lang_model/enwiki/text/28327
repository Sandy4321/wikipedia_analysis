The '''Battle of Arawe''' was a battle during the [[New Britain Campaign]] of [[World War II]]. The battle formed part of [[Operation Cartwheel]], and had the objective of serving as a diversion before a larger landing at [[Cape Gloucester]] in late December 1944. Arawe was attacked on 15&nbsp;December 1943 by United States and Australian forces, and was secured after a month of fighting.

During initial Allied planning, the landing at Arawe had the goals of securing a base for American [[PT boats]] and diverting Japanese forces away from Cape Gloucester. The PT boat base was later deemed unnecessary, and was never built. Only a small Japanese force was stationed at Arawe at the time, though reinforcements were ''en-route''. The main Allied landing on 15&nbsp;December was successful, though it was marred by a failed subsidiary landing and problems coordinating the landing craft. American forces quickly secured a [[beachhead]] and dug in. Japanese air units heavily raided the Arawe area in the days after the landing, and [[Imperial Japanese Army]] units were directed to attack the American force. These counter-attacks took place in late December, and were unsuccessful. In mid-January 1944 the American force, which had been reinforced with additional [[infantry]] and [[tank]]s, launched a brief offensive which pushed the Japanese back. The Japanese force at Arawe withdrew from the area towards the end of February as part of a general retreat from western New Britain.

==Background==
===Military situation===
In June 1943, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] launched a major offensive<U+2014>designated Operation Cartwheel<U+2014>which sought to capture the major Japanese base at [[Rabaul]] on the eastern tip of [[New Britain]]. During the next five months, Australian and US forces under the overall command of General [[Douglas MacArthur]] advanced along the north coast of eastern New Guinea, capturing [[Lae]] and the [[Huon Peninsula]] in September. US forces under the command of Admiral [[William Halsey, Jr.]] simultaneously advanced through the [[Solomon Islands]] from [[Guadalcanal]] and established an air base at [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] in November.<ref>Coakley (1989), pp. 510<U+2013>511</ref> Plans for Operation Cartwheel were amended in August 1943 when the British and United States [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] approved the US [[Joint Chiefs of Staff|Joint Chiefs of Staff's]] proposal that Rabaul be isolated rather than captured.<ref>Miller (1959), p. 225</ref>
[[File:CartwheelAreaMap.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=A map of eastern New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago and Solomon Islands with towns and elevations marked|The area in which Operation Cartwheel took place]]

The Japanese [[Imperial General Headquarters]] assessed the strategic situation in the South-West Pacific in late September 1943 and concluded that the Allies would attempt to break through the northern Solomon Islands and [[Bismarck Archipelago]] in the coming months ''en route'' to Japan's inner perimeter in the western and central pacific. Accordingly, reinforcements were dispatched to strategic locations in the area in an attempt to slow the Allied advance. Strong forces were retained at Rabaul, however, as it was believed that the Allies would attack the town. At the time, Japanese positions in western New Britain were limited to airfields at [[Cape Gloucester]] on the island's western tip and several small way stations used by supply [[barge]]s travelling between Rabaul and New Guinea.<ref>Shaw and Kane (1963), pp. 324<U+2013>325</ref>

On 22&nbsp;September 1943, General MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) directed General [[Walter Krueger]]'s [[Sixth United States Army|Alamo Force]] to secure western New Britain and the surrounding islands. This operation had two goals; the first of these was to establish air and [[PT boat]] bases to attack the Japanese forces at Rabaul. The second objective was to secure the straits between New Guinea and New Britain so that convoys could safely pass through it ''en-route'' to further landings along New Guinea's north coast and beyond. To this end, GHQ directed that Cape Gloucester at the western end of New Britain and [[Gasmata]] on the island's south coast be captured.<ref>Miller (1959), pp. 272<U+2013>273</ref> The [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] was selected for the Cape Gloucester operation, and the heavily reinforced [[126th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|126th Regimental Combat Team]] from the [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|32nd Infantry Division]] was to attack Gasmata.<ref name="Miller_277"/>

Senior Allied commanders disagreed over whether it was necessary to land forces in western New Britain. Major General [[George Kenney]]<U+2014>commander of the Allied air forces in the South-West Pacific<U+2014>opposed the landings, arguing that it was not necessary to establish an air base at Cape Gloucester as the existing bases in New Guinea and surrounding islands were adequate to support the planned landings in the region. Vice Admiral [[Arthur S. Carpender]]<U+2014>commander of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]]<U+2014>and Rear Admiral [[Daniel E. Barbey]]<U+2014>commander of the [[Task Force 76]] (TF&nbsp;76)<U+2014>were in favor of securing Cape Gloucester to secure both sides of the straits, but opposed the landing at Gasmata as it was too close to the Japanese air bases at Rabaul. In response to Kenney and the Navy's concerns and intelligence reports that the Japanese had reinforced their garrison at Gasmata, the landing there was cancelled in early November.<ref>Miller (1959), pp. 273<U+2013>274</ref>

On 21&nbsp;November, a conference between GHQ, Kenney, Carpender and Barbey was held in [[Brisbane]] at which it was decided to land a small force in the Arawe area to establish a PT boat base and create a diversion prior to the main landing at Cape Gloucester.<ref name="Miller_274">Miller (1959), p. 274</ref> The landing at Arawe had three goals; firstly to divert Japanese attention away from Cape Gloucester, secondly to establish a defensive perimeter and make contact with the marines once they landed and thirdly to establish a base for PT boats.<ref name="Holzimmer_117">Holzimmer (2007), p. 117</ref> It was intended that PT boats operating from Arawe would disrupt Japanese barge traffic along the southern shore of New Britain and protect the Allied naval forces at Cape Gloucester from attack.<ref name="Morison_372">Morison (1958), p. 372</ref>

===Geography===
The Arawe area lies on the south coast of New Britain about {{convert|100|mi|nmi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} from the island's western tip. Its main geographical feature is Cape Merkus, which ends in the 'L'-shaped Arawe Peninsula. Several small islands called the Arawe islands lie to the south-west of the Cape.<ref name="Rottman_2002_186">Rottman (2002), p. 186</ref>

In late 1943, the Arawe Peninsula was covered by the Amalut Plantation and the terrain inland from the peninsula and on its offshore islands was swampy. Most of the shoreline in the area comprises limestone cliffs.<ref name=Rottman_2002_186 /> There was a small unused airfield {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of the neck of the Arawe Peninsula, and a coastal trail leading east from Cape Merkus to the Pulie River where it split into tracks running inland and along the coast. The terrain to the west of the peninsula was a trackless region of swamp and jungle which was very difficult for troops to move through.<ref name="Shaw_Kane_334">Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 334</ref> Several of the beaches in the area were suitable for landing craft; the best were House Fireman on the peninsula's west coast and the village of Umtingaulu to the east of the peninsula's base.<ref name="Miller_283">Miller (1959), p. 283</ref>

==Prelude==
===Planning===
Alamo Force was responsible for coordinating plans for the invasion of western New Britain. The Arawe landing was scheduled for 15&nbsp;December; this was the earliest date by which the air bases needed to support the landing could be made operational and also gave the landing force time to conduct essential training and rehearsals.<ref>Miller (1959), pp. 274<U+2013>275</ref> As Arawe was believed to be only weakly defended, Krueger decided to use a smaller force than that which had been selected for the landing at Gasmata.<ref name="Miller_277"/> This force<U+2014>which was designated the Director Task Force<U+2014>was concentrated at [[Goodenough Island]] where it was stripped of all equipment not needed for combat operations. Logistical plans called for the assault echelon to carry 30 days worth of general supplies and enough ammunition for three days of intensive combat. After the landing holdings would be expanded to 60 days of general supplies and six days worth of all categories of ammunition other than anti-aircraft ammunition, for which a 10-day supply was thought necessary.<ref name="Miller_279">Miller (1959), p. 279</ref> The assault force and its supplies were to be carried in fast ships which could rapidly unload their cargo and leave the area.<ref name="Shaw_Kane_335">Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 335</ref>

The commander of the PT boat force in the South-West Pacific, Commander [[Morton C. Mumma]], opposed building a PT boat base at Arawe, as he had sufficient bases and Japanese barges normally sailed along the north coast of New Britain. He took his concerns to Carpender and Barbey who eventually agreed that he would not be required to establish a base there if he thought it unnecessary.<ref name="Morison_372"/> Instead, he assigned six boats stationed at [[Dreger Harbor]] in New Guinea and [[Kiriwina|Kiriwina Island]]to operate along the south coast of New Britain east of Arawe each night, and asked for only emergency refuelling facilities to be established at Arawe.<ref name="Shaw_Kane_336"/>

The Director Task Force's commander<U+2014>Brigadier General [[Julian W. Cunningham]]<U+2014>issued the orders for the landing on 4&nbsp;December. Under these plans, the Task Force was to initially capture the Arawe Peninsula and surrounding islands and establish an outpost on the trail leading to the Pulie River. Once the beachhead was secure, amphibious patrols would be conducted to the west of the peninsula to attempt to make contact with the marines at Cape Gloucester. Two subsidiary landings were planned to take place one hour before dawn; this was also before the main body of the Director Task Force landed at House Fireman Beach on the Arawe Peninsula. One landing was to capture Pitoe Island to the Peninsula's south, as it was believed that the Japanese had established a radio station and a defensive position there which commanded the entrance to Arawe Harbour. The other landing was to be made at Umtingalu to establish a blocking position on the coastal trail east of the peninsula.<ref>Shaw and Kane (1963), pp. 334<U+2013>335</ref> U.S.&nbsp;Navy personnel on the planning staff were concerned about the subsidiary landings, as a night-time landing [[Landing at Lae|conducted at Lae]] in September had proven difficult.<ref name="Barbey_101">Barbey (1969), p. 101</ref>

===Opposing forces===
{{Main|Battle of Arawe order of battle}}

The Director Task Force was centered around the US Army's [[112th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|112th&nbsp;Cavalry Regimental Combat Team]] (112th&nbsp;RCT). This regiment had arrived in the Pacific in August 1942 but had not seen combat. It was dismounted and converted to an infantry unit in May 1943, and undertook an unopposed landing at [[Woodlark Island]] ([[Operation Chronicle]]) on 23&nbsp;June.<ref>Rottman (2009), pp. 21<U+2013>22</ref> The 112th Cavalry Regiment was smaller and more lightly armed than US infantry regiments as it had only two [[battalion]]-sized [[Squadron (army)|squadron]]s compared to the three battalions in infantry regiments.<ref name="Rottman_2009_13">Rottman (2009), p. 13</ref> The 112th&nbsp;RCT's combat support units were the [[M101 howitzer|M2A1 howitzer]]-equipped 148th&nbsp;Field Artillery battalion and the 59th&nbsp;Engineer Company. The other combat units of the Director Task Force were the 236th&nbsp;Anti-aircraft Artillery Battalion (Searchlight) less elements, two batteries of the 470th&nbsp;Anti-aircraft Artillery Battalion (Automatic Weapons), A&nbsp;Company, [[Combat Assault Battalion|1st&nbsp;Amphibious Tractor Battalion]] and a detachment from the 26th&nbsp;Quartermaster War Dog Platoon.<ref name="Rottman_2009_24">Rottman (2009), p. 24</ref> The 2nd Battalion of the [[158th Infantry Regiment (United States)|158th&nbsp;Infantry Regiment]] was held in reserve to reinforce the Director Task Force if required. Several engineer, medical, ordnance and other support units were scheduled to arrive at Arawe after the landing was completed.<ref name="Miller_277">Miller (1959), p. 277</ref> Cunningham requested that a [[90 mm Gun M1/M2/M3|{{convert|90|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}]] anti-aircraft gun-equipped battery be added to the force, but none were available.<ref name= "Shaw_Kane_336">Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 336</ref> The US&nbsp;Navy's Beach Party Number 1 would also be landed with the Director Task Force, but was withdrawn once the beachhead was secured.<ref>Barbey (1969), pp. 103<U+2013>104</ref>
[[File:Western New Britain Operation.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=A map of western New Britain showing the movements of Japanese forces and landings of Allied forces as described in the article|Movements of Japanese forces in western New Britain during late 1943 and early 1944 and locations of Allied landings]]

The Director Task Force was supported by Allied naval and air units. The naval force was drawn from TF&nbsp;76 and comprised U.S. Navy destroyers {{USS|Conyngham|DD-371|6}} (Barbey's flagship), {{USS|Shaw|DD-373|2}}, {{USS|Drayton|DD-366|2}}, {{USS|Bagley|DD-386|2}}, {{USS|Reid|DD-369|2}}, {{USS|Smith|DD-378|2}}, {{USS|Lamson|DD-367|2}}, {{USS|Flusser|DD-368|2}} and {{USS|Mahan|DD-364|2}}, a transport group with destroyer transports {{USS|Humphreys|DD-236|6}} and {{USS|Sands|DD-243|2}}, transport ships {{HMAS|Westralia|1939|6}} and {{USS|Carter Hall|LSD-3|6}}, two patrol craft and two submarine chasers and a service group with three [[Landing Ship, Tank|LSTs]], three [[tugboat]]s and the [[destroyer tender]] {{USS|Rigel|AD-13|6}}.<ref name= "Gill_338">Gill (1968), p. 338</ref><ref name="Morison_1958_374">Morison (1958), p. 374</ref> [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) and [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) units operating under the [[Fifth Air Force]] would support the landing, but only limited air support was to be available after 15&nbsp;December.<ref name="Morison_1958_373">Morison (1958), p. 373</ref> Parties of Australian [[coastwatchers]] on New Britain were also reinforced during September 1943 to provide warning of air attacks from Rabaul bound for the Allied landing sites.<ref>Gill (1968), pp. 335<U+2013>336</ref>

At the time of the Allied landing, Arawe was defended by only a small force, though reinforcements were ''en route''. The Japanese force at Arawe comprised 120 soldiers and sailors organized in two temporary companies drawn from the [[51st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|51st&nbsp;Division]].<ref>Shaw and Kane (1963), pp. 339<U+2013>340</ref> The reinforcing units were elements of the [[17th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|17th&nbsp;Division]], which had been shipped from China to Rabaul during October 1943 to reinforce western New Britain ahead of the expected Allied invasion. The [[convoy]]s carrying the division were attacked by U.S.&nbsp;Navy submarines and USAAF bombers, resulting in 1,173 of its men being killed or wounded. The 1st Battalion, 81st&nbsp;Infantry Regiment was assigned to defend Cape Merkus. However, it did not depart Rabaul until December as it needed to be reorganized after suffering casualties when the ship transporting it from China was sunk. In addition, two of its rifle companies, most of its heavy machine guns and all its {{convert|70|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} howitzers were retained by the 8th&nbsp;Area Army at Rabaul, leaving the battalion with a strength of just its headquarters, two rifle companies and a machine gun platoon. This battalion<U+2014>which came under the command of Major Masamitsu Komori<U+2014>was a four-day march from Arawe when the Allies landed.<ref>Shaw and Kane (1963), pp. 327<U+2013>328</ref> A company from the 54th&nbsp;Infantry Regiment, some engineers and detachments from other units were also assigned to the Arawe area. The ground forces at Arawe came under the overall command of General Matsuda, whose headquarters were located near Cape Gloucester.<ref name ="Miller_280">Miller (1959), p. 280</ref> The Japanese air units at Rabaul had been greatly weakened in the months prior to the landing at Arawe by prolonged Allied attacks and the transfer of the [[7th Air Division (Japan)|7th&nbsp;Air Division]] to western New Guinea.<ref>Miller (1959), pp. 281<U+2013>282</ref> Nevertheless, the Japanese [[11th Air Fleet|11th&nbsp;Air Fleet]] had 100 fighters and 50 bombers based at Rabaul at the time of the landing at Arawe.<ref name="Miller_287">Miller (1959), p. 287</ref>

===Preliminary operations===
The Allies possessed little [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] on western New Britain's terrain and the exact location of Japanese forces. To rectify this, Allied aircraft conducted extensive [[Aerial photography|air photography]] and small ground patrols were landed by PT boats.<ref>Miller (1959), pp. 276<U+2013>277</ref> A small team from [[Special Service Unit No. 1]] reconnoitered Arawe on the night of 9/10 December and concluded that there were few Japanese troops in the area.<ref name= "Miller_277"/><ref>Rottman (2005), p. 37</ref> This party was detected near the village of Umtingalu, leading the Japanese to strengthen their defenses there.<ref>Morison (1958), pp. 374<U+2013>375</ref>

The Allied air forces began pre-invasion raids on western New Britain on 13&nbsp;November. Few attacks were made on the Arawe area, however, in an attempt to achieve tactical surprise. Instead, heavy attacks were made against Gasmata, Ring Ring Plantation, and Lindenhafen Plantation. The Arawe area was struck for the first time on 6&nbsp;December and again on 8&nbsp;December; little opposition was encountered on either occasion. It was not until 14&nbsp;December<U+2014>the day before the landing<U+2014>that heavy air attacks on Arawe were conducted. On this day, Allied aircraft flew 273 sorties against targets on New Britain's south coast.<ref>Mortensen (1950), pp. 332<U+2013>335</ref>

The Director Task Force was concentrated at Goodenough Island in early December 1943. A full-scale rehearsal of the landing was held there which revealed problems with coordinating the waves of boats and demonstrated that some of the force's officers lacked confidence in conducting amphibious operations. There was not sufficient time to conduct further training to rectify these problems, however.<ref name="Shaw_Kane_336"/> The Task Force embarked onto transport ships during the afternoon of 13&nbsp;December, and the convoy sailed at midnight. It proceeded to [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]] to rendezvous with most of the escorting destroyers and made a feint towards [[Finschhafen]] before turning towards Arawe after dusk on 14&nbsp;December. The convoy was detected by a Japanese aircraft shortly before it anchored off Arawe at 3:30&nbsp;am on 15&nbsp;December, and the Japanese 11th&nbsp;Air Fleet at Rabaul began to prepare aircraft to attack it.<ref name="Morison_1958_374"/><ref name="Shaw_Kane_338"/>

==Battle==
[[File:USA-P-Rabaul-17.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=A black and white map of the Arawe area depicting the 112th Cavalry Regiment's landing on 15 December 1943 as described in the article|Arawe landings, 15&nbsp;December 1943]]

===Landings===
Shortly after the assault convoy arrived off Arawe, ''Carter Hall'' launched her [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVTs]] and ''Westralia'' her landing craft. The two large transports departed for New Guinea at 5:00&nbsp;am. The [[high speed transport]]s carrying A and B&nbsp;Troops of the 112th&nbsp;Cavalry Regiment's 1st&nbsp;Squadron closed to within {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} of Umtingalu and Pilelo Island respectively, and unloaded the soldiers into rubber boats.<ref name="Shaw_Kane_338">Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 338</ref>

A&nbsp;Troop's attempt to land at Umtingalu was unsuccessful. At about 5:25&nbsp;am, the troop came under fire from machine guns, rifles and a {{convert|25|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} cannon as it was nearing the shore, and all but three of its 15 rubber boats were sunk.<ref name="Miller_284">Miller (1959), p. 284</ref> ''Shaw''<U+2014>the destroyer assigned to support the landing<U+2014>was unable to provide supporting fire until 5:42&nbsp;am as her crew initially could not determine if the soldiers in the water were in the ship's line of fire; once she had a clear shot, ''Shaw'' silenced the Japanese positions with two salvo's from her {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns.<ref>Shaw and Kane (1963), pp. 338<U+2013>339</ref> The surviving cavalrymen were rescued by small boats and later landed at House Fireman beach; casualties in this operation were 12 killed, four missing and 17 wounded.<ref name="Miller_285">Miller (1959), p. 285</ref> A&nbsp;Troop lost all of its equipment during the landing attempt, and replacement equipment was air dropped into the beachhead during the afternoon of 16&nbsp;December.<ref name="Mortensen_335">Mortensen (1950), p. 335</ref>

B&nbsp;Troop's landing at Pilelo Island was successful. The goal of this operation was to destroy a Japanese radio station believed to be at the village of Paligmete on the island's east coast. While the Troop originally intended to make a surprise landing at Paligmete, it switched to the island's west coast after A&nbsp;Troop came under attack. Once ashore, the cavalrymen advanced across the island and came under fire from a small Japanese force at the village of Winguru. After finding Paligmete unoccupied, B&nbsp;Troop attacked Winguru and used [[bazooka]]s and [[flamethrower]]s to destroy the Japanese positions there. One American and seven Japanese soldiers were killed in this fighting.<ref name= "Miller_285"/>

The 2nd Squadron, 112th&nbsp;Cavalry Regiment made the main landing at House Fireman Beach. The landing was delayed by difficulties forming the LVTs into an assault formation and a strong current, and the first wave landed at 7:28&nbsp;am rather than 6:30&nbsp;am as planned. Destroyers bombarded the beach with 1,800 rounds of 5&nbsp;in ammunition between 6:10 and 6:25&nbsp;am, and [[B-25 Mitchell]]s strafed the area once the bombardment concluded. The delays meant that landing area was not under fire as the troops approached the beach, and Japanese machine gunners fired on the LVTs; rockets fired from {{USS|SC-742||2}} and two [[DUKW]]s rapidly silenced these guns. The first wave of cavalrymen were fortunate to meet little opposition as there were further delays in landing the follow-up waves due to differences in the speeds of the two types of LVTs used. While the four follow-up waves were scheduled to land at five minute intervals after the first wave, the second wave landed 25 minutes after the initial force and the succeeding three waves landed simultaneously 15 minutes later.<ref>Miller (1959), pp. 285<U+2013>286</ref><ref name="Shaw_Kane_339">Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 339</ref> Within two hours of the landing, all the large Allied ships other than Barbey's flagship had departed from Arawe. ''Conyngham'' remained in the area to rescue the survivors of the landing at Umtingalu, and withdrew later that day.<ref>Barbey (1969), pp. 106<U+2013>107</ref>

Once ashore, the cavalrymen rapidly secured the Arawe Peninsula. A patrol sent to the peninsula's toe met only scattered resistance from Japanese rear guards. Over 20 Japanese were located in a cave on the east side of the peninsula, and these were killed by E Troop and personnel from the Squadron Headquarters. The remaining Japanese units in the area retreated to the east. The 2nd Squadron reached the peninsula's base in the mid afternoon of the 15th, and began to prepare its [[main line of resistance]] (MLR) there.<ref>Miller (1959), pp. 286<U+2013>287</ref> By the end of 15 December over 1,600 Allied troops were ashore.<ref name="Miller_287"/>

The naval force off Arawe was subjected to a heavy air raid shortly after the landing. At 9:00 am, eight [[Aichi D3A]] "Val" dive bombers escorted by 56 [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|A6M5 Zero]] fighters evaded the USAAF [[combat air patrol]] (CAP) of 16 [[P-38 Lightning]]s. The Japanese force attacked the recently-arrived first supply echelon, which comprised five [[Landing craft tank]] (LCT) and 14 [[Landing Craft Medium]] (LCM), but these ships managed to evade the bombs dropped on them.<ref name="Morison_376">Morison (1958), p. 376</ref> While the first wave of attackers suffered no losses, at 11:15&nbsp;am four P-38s shot down a Zero, and at 6:00&nbsp;pm a force of 30 Zeros and 12 [[Mitsubishi G4M]]3 "Betty" and [[Mitsubishi Ki-21]]-II "Sally" bombers was driven off by four P-38s.<ref name="Mortensen_336">Mortensen (1950), p. 336</ref>

===Air attacks and base development===
Although the US ground troops faced no opposition in the days immediately after the landing, naval convoys carrying reinforcements to the Arawe area were repeatedly attacked.<ref name="Miller_287"/> The second supply echelon came under continuous air attack on 16&nbsp;December, resulting in the loss of {{USS|APc-21||2}}, damage to {{USS|SC-743||2}}, {{USS|YMS-50||2}} as well as four LCTs and about 42 men killed or seriously wounded. Another reinforcement convoy was attacked three times by dive bombers on 21&nbsp;December as it unloaded. Further air attacks took place on 26, 27 and 31&nbsp;December.<ref name= "Morison_377">Morison (1958), p. 377</ref> Between 15 and 31&nbsp;December, at least 24 Japanese bombers and 32 fighters were shot down in the Arawe area.<ref name="Mortensen_336"/> The process of unloading ships at Arawe was hampered by air attacks and congestion on House Fireman Beach. The beach party contributed to these delays as it was too small and lacked experience. The resultant problems with unloading LCTs caused some to leave the area before they had discharged all their cargo.<ref>Shaw and Kane (1963), pp. 340<U+2013>342</ref>

Air attacks on Arawe dropped off after 1&nbsp;January. From this date most raids took place at night, and few occurred after 90&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns were established at Arawe on 1 February.<ref name= "Mortensen_337">Mortensen (1950), p. 337</ref> These weak attacks did not disrupt the Allied convoys.<ref name="Morison_377"/> In the three weeks after the landing, {{convert|6287|ST|t|abbr=on}} of supplies and 541 guns and vehicles were transported to Arawe.<ref name="Morison_377"/>

Following the landing, the 59th&nbsp;Engineer Company constructed logistics facilities in the Arawe area. Due to the Japanese air raids, priority was given to the construction of a partially underground evacuation hospital, and it was completed in January 1944. The underground hospital was replaced with a 120-bed above-ground facility in April 1944. Pilelo Island was selected for the site of the PT boat facilities, and a pier for refueling the boats and dispersed fuel storage bays were built there. A {{convert|172|ft|m|abbr=on}} pier was built at House Fireman Beach between 26&nbsp;February and 22&nbsp;April 1944 to accommodate small ships; three LCT jetties were also constructed north of the beach. A {{convert|920|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} airstrip was hurriedly built for artillery observation aircraft on 13&nbsp;January, and this was later upgraded and surfaced with coral. The engineer company also constructed {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} of all-weather roads in the Arawe region and provided the Director Task Force with water via salt water distillation units on Pilelo Island and wells dug on the mainland. These projects were continuously hampered by shortages of construction materials, but the engineers were able to complete them though improvising and making use of salvaged material.<ref>Office of the Chief Engineer, General Headquarters Army Forces, Pacific (1951), p. 192</ref>

===Japanese response===
The commander of the Japanese 17th&nbsp;Division<U+2014>General Sakai<U+2014>ordered that Arawe be urgently reinforced when he was informed of the landing. The force under Major Komori was ordered to make haste, and the 1st Battalion, 141st&nbsp;Infantry Regiment (less one company) was directed to move to Arawe by sea from Cape Bushing. Komori was designated the commander of all Japanese forces in the Arawe area. The 1st Battalion, 141st&nbsp;Infantry Regiment landed at the village of Omoi on the night of 18 December, and started overland the next day to join Komori's force at Didmop. Komori reached Didmop on 19&nbsp;December, and gathered the force which was retreating from Umtingalu into this command. The 1st Battalion, 141st&nbsp;Infantry Regiment took eight days to cover the {{convert|7|mi|km|abbr=on}} between Omoi and Didmop, however, as it became lost on several occasions while travelling through trackless jungle and paused whenever contact with American forces seemed likely.<ref name="Shaw_Kane_342"/>

After establishing its beachhead on 15&nbsp;December, the Director Task Force was reinforced and began patrols of the area. Cunningham had been ordered to gather intelligence on Japanese forces in western New Britain, and on 17&nbsp;December he dispatched a patrol of cavalrymen in two [[LCVP]]s to the west of Arawe to investigate the [[Itni River]] area. These landing craft encountered seven Japanese barges carrying part of the 1st Battalion, 141st&nbsp;Infantry Regiment near [[Cape Peiho]], {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Arawe, on 18&nbsp;December. After an exchange of gunfire the US soldiers abandoned their landing craft and returned to Arawe along the coast.<ref name="Shaw_Kane_342">Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 342</ref><ref name="Miller_288">Miller (1959), p. 288</ref>

After organizing his force while waiting for the 1st Battalion, 141st&nbsp;Infantry Regiment for several days, Komori began his advance on Arawe on 24&nbsp;December. He arrived at the airstrip to the north of Arawe during the early hours of Christmas Day and forced the 112th&nbsp;Cavalry Regiment's patrols back on Umtingalu, which was evacuated shortly thereafter. That night, the Japanese mounted a company-strength probing attack on the American MLR which was repulsed with at least 12 Japanese killed.<ref name="Shaw_Kane_343">Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 343</ref> The fighting to the west and north of Arawe led Cunningham to incorrectly believe that Komori's force was the advance guard of a large force dispatched from Gasmata. In response, he requested reinforcements from Krueger who dispatched G Company of the 158th&nbsp;Infantry Regiment to Arawe on board PT boats.<ref name="Miller_288"/>

The Japanese offensive continued after the Christmas Day attack. Further attacks were made in the next few days, including daytime attacks on 28 and 29&nbsp;December. All were repelled by American [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] fire, and most of Komori's initial force was killed during the attack on 29 December. The 1st Battalion, 141st&nbsp;Infantry Regiment arrived in the Arawe area on the afternoon off 29&nbsp;December, and conducted several small and unsuccessful attacks in early January 1944 before taking up positions about {{convert|400|-|500|yd|m|abbr=on}} north of the American MLR. These positions comprised shallow trenches and foxholes which were difficult to see. While only about 100 Japanese soldiers were in the area, they moved their six machine guns frequently, making them difficult targets for American mortars and artillery.<ref name="Miller_288"/>

===American counter attack===
[[File:Tank attack Arawe.jpg|thumb|alt=Rear view of three World War II-era tanks moving in a line between tall palm trees. A man wearing military uniform is crouching in the foreground|USMC tanks supporting the Army advance on 16 January.]]

American patrols located the Japanese defensive position on 31&nbsp;December. Several attacks were made upon the area in the next few days, but without success. On 6&nbsp;January 1944, Cunningham requested further reinforcements, including [[tank]]s to tackle the Japanese defenses. Krueger approved this request and ordered F&nbsp;Company, 158th&nbsp;Infantry Regiment and B&nbsp;Company of the [[United States Marine Corps]]' (USMC) [[1st Tank Battalion]] to Arawe; the two units arrived on 10 and 12&nbsp;January respectively. The Marine tanks and two companies of the 158th&nbsp;Infantry Regiment subsequently practiced tank-infantry cooperation from 13<U+2013>15&nbsp;January, while the 112th&nbsp;Cavalry continued to conduct patrols into Japanese-held areas.<ref name="Shaw_Kane_392">Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 392</ref><ref name="Miller_289">Miller (1959), p. 289</ref>

The Director Task Force launched its attack on 16&nbsp;January. That morning, a squadron of [[B-24 Liberator]] heavy bombers dropped one hundred and thirty-six {{convert|1000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs on the Japanese defenses, and 20 B-25s strafed the area. Following an intensive artillery and mortar barrage the Marine tank company, two companies of the 158th&nbsp;Infantry and C&nbsp;Troop, 112th&nbsp;Cavalry Regiment attacked. The tanks led the advance, with each being followed by a group of infantry or cavalrymen. The attack was successful, and reached its objectives by 4:00&nbsp;pm. Cunningham then directed the force to withdraw back to the MLR; during this part of the operation two Marine tanks<U+2014>which had become immobile<U+2014>were destroyed to prevent the Japanese from using them as [[Bunker|pillboxes]].<ref name="Miller_289"/><ref>Shaw and Kane (1963), pp. 392<U+2013>393</ref>

Following the American attack, Komori pulled his remaining force back to defend the airstrip. As this was not an Allied objective, the Japanese were not subjected to further attacks by ground troops other than occasional patrol clashes and ambushes. They suffered from severe supply shortages, however, and many fell sick. Attempts to bring supplies in by sea from Gasmata were disrupted by U.S.&nbsp;Navy PT boats and the force lacked enough porters to supply itself through overland trails. Komori concluded that his force was serving no purpose, and on &nbsp; February informed his superiors that it faced destruction due to supply shortages.<ref name="Shaw_Kane_393">Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 393</ref> They responded by ordering the force to hold its position, however, though it was awarded two Imperial citations in recognition of its supposed success in defending the airstrip.<ref name="Shaw_Kane_394">Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 394</ref>

==Aftermath==
The 1st&nbsp;Marine Division's landing at Cape Gloucester on 26&nbsp;December 1943 was successful. The marines secured the airfields which were the main objective of the operation on 29&nbsp;December against only light Japanese opposition. Heavy fighting took place during the first two weeks of 1944, however, when the marines advanced south east of their initial beachhead to secure Borgen Bay. Little fighting took place once this area had been captured and the marines patrolled extensively in an attempt to locate the Japanese.<ref>Miller (1959), pp. 289<U+2013>294</ref> On 16&nbsp;February, a marine patrol from Cape Gloucester made contact with an army patrol from Arawe at the village of Gilnit.<ref name="Shaw_Kane_403">Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 403</ref> On 23&nbsp;February, the remnants of the Japanese force at Cape Gloucester were ordered to withdraw to Rabaul.<ref name= "Miller_294">Miller (1959), p. 294</ref>

The Komori Force was also ordered to withdraw on 24&nbsp;February as part of the general Japanese retreat from western New Britain. The Japanese immediately began to leave their positions, and headed north along inland trails to join other units. The Americans did not detect this withdrawal until 27&nbsp;February, when an attack conducted by the 2nd&nbsp;Squadron, 112th&nbsp;Cavalry and the Marine tank company to clear the Arawe area of Japanese encountered no opposition.<ref name= "Shaw_Kane_394"/> Major Komori fell behind his unit, and was killed on 9&nbsp;April near San Remo on New Britain's north coast when he, his executive officer and two enlisted men they were travelling with were ambushed by a patrol from the [[2nd Battalion 5th Marines]].<ref>Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 427</ref>

<!-- As the original goal for the Allied landings of creating a PT boat base was dropped before the operation commenced, and a base was never developed at Arawe.<ref>Miller (1959). Page 289.</ref> Therefore, the US attack on Arawe served only to divert the Japanese attention away from the larger landing at [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]].<ref>Morison (1958). Page 377.</ref> In this it was successful. -->
The 112th&nbsp;Cavalry Regiment remained at Arawe until late April 1944, when it was replaced by elements of the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th&nbsp;Infantry Division]].<ref>{{cite web| publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]]| url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/cbtchron/cc/040id.htm | title = Combat Chronicle of the 40th Infantry Division|accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> By this time, the 112th&nbsp;Cavalry's strength had declined from 1,728 at the start of the battle to about 1,100 due to sickness and combat casualties.<ref>Drea (1984)</ref> The 40th&nbsp;Infantry Division battalion remained at Arawe until the [[Australian Army]]'s [[5th Division (Australia)|5th Division]] assumed responsibility for New Britain in late November 1944.<ref>Long (1963), p. 241</ref>
