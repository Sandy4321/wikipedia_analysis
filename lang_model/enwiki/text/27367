==Personal==
Telpuk is a former [[nursery school]] teacher.<ref name=SGF8GSB/> She was raised in a small town in the [[Santa Fe Province]] where she taught nursery school, but she moved to Buenos Aires after passing an [[entrance exam]] for the Airport Security Police about three years prior to the [[Maletinazo]] incident.<ref name=SGF8GSB/> In the short time since Telpuk has transformed from night shift police woman to pinup girl almost overnight. She has left the police force, joined a [[charter airline]], begun taking English classes and begun to prepare for a role on ''Skating for a Dream'', an Argentine [[variety show]].<ref name=Sgch15m>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-suitcase17feb17,1,6122754.story|title='Suitcase-gate' gives cop her 15 minutes|accessdate=2008-03-16|date=2008-02-17|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=McDonnell, Patrick J. |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080220073024/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-suitcase17feb17,1,6122754.story |archivedate = February 20, 2008}}</ref>

Telpuk's mother Yolanda lives in a [[middle-class]] suburb of Buenos Aires.<ref name=SGF8GSB/> She is widowed and used to work for a [[pasta]] factory.<ref name=Sgch15m/>

==Maletinazo==
On August 4, 2007 at 2:45&nbsp;a.m.,<ref name=VVW$RUAR>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&sid=a73rBCz3iDho&refer=latin_america|title=Venezuelan Valise With $790,550 Roils U.S.-Argentina Relations|accessdate=2008-03-16|date=2008-01-07|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|work=[[Bloomberg.com]]|author=Voreacos, David, Eliana Raszewski and Bill Faries}}</ref> she discovered the money that became part of a political scandal in the electoral campaign of [[President of Argentina]] [[Cristina Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Kirchner]] and that was possessed by a [[Key Biscayne, Florida]] associate of [[President of Venezuela]] [[Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez]].<ref name=APMCS/><ref name=Sgch15m/> The carrier, Guido Antonini Wilson (who is referred to in the press by both Antonini and Wilson and who is sometimes referred to by the nicknames "El Gordo" or "The Fat Man"),<ref name=Apcc>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6946348.stm|title=Argentina probes cash-filled case|publisher=[[BBC]]|work=BBC News|author=Schweimler, Daniel | date=2007-08-14 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref> is an [[interpreter]] and was part of a delegation of executives that traveled to Argentina in advance of Ch<U+00E1>vez' energy deal signing.<ref name=Apcc/> He opened the bag at the insistence of Telpuk, who noticed the six dense and perfectly rectangular blocks in the luggage scans.<ref name=SGF8GSB/> At first, Wilson had explained the items as books and papers at first.<ref name=Sgch15m/><ref name=VVW$RUAR/> When forced to open it, he began to stammer and show signs of nervousness,<ref name=Sgch15m/> and he said the suitcase only contained about $60,000.<ref name=VVW$RUAR/> The blocks turned out to be US$790,550.<ref name=SGF8GSB/> The delegation, which arrived on a [[Cessna Citation]] jet arriving from [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]] chartered by [[Enarsa|Energ<U+00ED>a Argentina, SA]], carried five Venezuelans and three Argentines who represented their respective governments' energy companies.<ref name=SGF8GSB/> In a country known for its corruption, Telpuk did not have an interest in a [[bribe]] although she felt Wilson may have expected her to be willing to take one. Instead of pursuing a bribe, she reported the finding.<ref name=APMCS/>

Although the local media of both Argentina and Venezuela gave the story immediate front page coverage, the case faded away until after Kirchner was elected.<ref name=Sgch15m/><ref name=VVW$RUAR/> The United States prosecutors believe that the money represented a contribution from Venezuelan President Ch<U+00E1>vez to the presidential campaign of Argentina's [[leftist]] leader, Kirchner.<ref name=SGF8GSB/> Two days after the December 10, 2007 inauguration, several arrests were announced by [[prosecutor]]s working for the [[United States Attorney General]]. The arrests were for activities related to having offered Wilson $2 million to keep quiet about the contributions from Venezuela to support Kirchner's campaign.<ref name=SGF8GSB/><ref name=VVW$RUAR/>  In addition to Maletinazo, the case is known in Latin America as "Valijagate" or "Suitcasegate",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:MIHB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=124890D0E5D83B80&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Suitcase-cash trial nears end|accessdate=2008-12-09|date=2008-10-15|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|author=Chardy, Alfonso}}</ref> and Telpuk is known as the Suitcase Girl in her homeland, Argentina.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:MIHB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=1238158D4F17EFF8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=FEDERAL COURT: Playboy pinup arrives to testify on suitcase cash - The Argentine airport officer-turned-Playboy pinup who set off an scandal when she found a suitcase full of cash landed in Miami to testify in a federal trial.|accessdate=2008-12-09|date=2008-09-29|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|author=Woods, Casey and Gerardo Reyes}}</ref> 

For her part, Telpuk felt she was caught in the "middle of a rivalry of nations".<ref name=Sgch15m/> She has been vilified as a [[mercenary]] fortune-seeker and [[CIA]] lackey.<ref name=Sgch15m/> She has received a variety of threats by telephone and [[email]], and had police protection starting when the incident became a public scandal in December.<ref name=SGF8GSB/> She has even received a [[flower bouquet|bouquet]] with an ominous note.<ref name=APMCS/>

==Media appearances==
Her first magazine cover appearance was on the December issue of an irreverent political magazine, ''Veintitr<U+00E9>s'' where Telpuk appeared under the headline "The Bombshell Behind the Suitcase" standing behind a suitcase. She wore little other than a police cap, and another headline on the cover read, "Is She the Key Piece of a Plot Designed by Washington?"<ref name=SGF8GSB/> She then appeared on the February issue of the Argentine edition of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine next to the headline "Corrupci<U+00F3>n Al Desnudo" (translated as "Corruption Laid Bare").<ref name=APMCS/> Subsequently, she appeared on the March 2008 issue of the Venezuelan edition of ''Playboy'' magazine. She posed with a red suitcase decorated with both the [[Flag of Argentina|Argentine]] and [[Flag of Venezuela|Venezuelan flags]] while wearing a scarf, black leather gloves and black-and-white boots for her ''Playboy'' cover appearance. Within the magazine in her [[pictorial]], she posed with fewer clothes and with various props: the ubiquitous suitcase, [[dollar bill]]s, including the [[propeller]] blades of a single-engine airplane.<ref name=Sgch15m/> She decided to pursue an appearance on the Argentine variety show "Bailando por un sue<U+00F1>o", after [[Marcelo Tinelli]] visited her at the airport to congratulate her.<ref name=SGF8GSB/>

Telpuk has appeared on various [[talk show]]s since the scandal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercopress.com/vernoticia.do?id=14690&formato=html|title=Clue witness ready to testify in suitcase money scandal |accessdate=2008-12-04|date=2008-09-29|publisher=MercoPress}}</ref>  In 2008, according to foreign language sources, she changed her name from Mar<U+00ED>a del Luj<U+00E1>n Telpuk to Lorena Telpuk; she was mysteriously dismissed from ''Skating for a Dream''; and she posed for additional adult modeling photographs in ''Premium'', an Argentine magazine.<ref name=Espanol1/><ref name=Espanol2/>  Telpuk had [[breast augmentation]] surgery prior to her late 2008 court appearances.<ref name=Pgthsssswc/>

==Court room==
Telpuk testified in court in October 2008 on various days spanning the weekend of October 5, 2008 regarding her knowledge in the famous suitcase scandal.<ref name=Pgthsssswc>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/05/argentina.venezuela|title=Pin-up girl tells how she spotted suitcase stuffed with cash|accessdate=2008-12-04|date=2008-10-05|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|work=[[The Observer]]|author=Carroll, Rory | location=London}}</ref>  Her October 3 testimony where she contradicted the testimony of Antonini in which he had stated that he was carrying the suitcase as a courtesy to his companions was considered a highlight of the trial.
