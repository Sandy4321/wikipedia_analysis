==History==
[[Image:GMB BFM 71104 1.jpg|thumb|A [[GMB Class 71|Class 71]] Airport Express Train ready for departure from [[Oslo Central Station|Oslo S]]]]
When the [[Parliament of Norway]] on 8 October 1992 decided to build a new central airport for [[Eastern Norway]], they also decided that the main mode of ground transport should be by rail. While the previous airport, [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu]], was located just outside the city limits, the new airport, Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, would be located {{convert|50|km|mi}} north of the city, outside the reach of existing [[public transport]]. The principle of the airport construction was that it was not to be footed by the tax payers; the entire airport would be built with [[debt|borrowed money]] through [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen|Oslo Lufthavn AS]], a subsidiary of the [[Avinor|Norwegian Airport Administration]]. The same principle was chosen for the airport rail link<U+2014>the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) creating the [[aksjeselskap|limited company]] subsidiary '''NSB Gardermobanen AS''', founded on 24 November 1992, to perform the construction of the line. It would be able to charge train operators using the line, channeling the payments to cover down payments and interest of the debt used to build the railway. [[Profit margin]] was estimated to 7.5%.<ref name=history />

===Construction===
{{Main|Gardermoen Line}}
Oslo Airport, Gardermoen is not on the [[Hoved Line|Trunk Line]] that runs north from Oslo. With heavy traffic and many small stops until [[Lillestr<U+00F8>m Station|Lillestr<U+00F8>m]], and continuing north as [[single track (rail)|single track]],<ref name=jbvstat45>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/multimedia/archive/01821/Jernbanestatistikk_1821829a.pdf |author=[[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] |title=Jernbanestatistikk 2007 |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-09-13 |format=PDF |page=45}} {{Dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot}}</ref> the Trunk Line would have to be supplemented by a parallel [[double track]] from Oslo, with a new route north of [[Kl<U+00F8>fta Station|Kl<U+00F8>fta]] to [[Eidsvoll Station|Eidsvoll]]; the {{convert|16|km|mi|0}} north of the airport allowing trains operating on the [[Dovre Line]] to [[Lillehammer Station|Lillehammer]] and [[Trondheim Central Station|Trondheim]] to access the airport. The {{convert|64|km|mi|adj=on}} line was named the Gardermo Line.<ref name=jbvstat6>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/multimedia/archive/01821/Jernbanestatistikk_1821829a.pdf |author=[[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] |title=Jernbanestatistikk 2007 |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-09-13 |format=PDF |page=6}} {{Dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot}}</ref>

The Gardermo Line was the second attempt to build high-speed rail in Norway, after the {{convert|35|km|mi|adj=on}} line from [[Ski Station|Ski]] to [[Moss Station|Moss]] on the [[<U+00D8>stfold Line]]. But no operation speeds exceeding {{convert|160|km/h|mph}} are achieved there due to short distances and limitations to rolling stock, making Gardermobanen the first real high-speed railway line in Norway. Due to the domination of single track in Norway, the opening of the Gardermo Line increased the total length of [[double track]] in the kingdom by two-thirds.<ref name=jbvstat6 />

Construction started in 1994.<ref name=history /> An agreement for purchase of sixteen three-car [[electric multiple unit]]s was signed with [[Adtranz]] on 23 February 1995. Parliament decided on 1 October 1996 that the construction company would also operate the new train service. The trains were delivered between 19 September 1997 and 30 January 1998,<ref name=elektrolok /> costing [[Norwegian krone|NOK]]&nbsp;1.4&nbsp;billion.<ref name=history />

===Challenges===
{{Main|Romerike Tunnel}}
[[Image:Lutvann.jpg|thumb|Lake [[Lutvann]] was partially drained due to construction problems during the digging of the [[Romerike Tunnel]]]]
The greatest challenge was the {{convert|14580|m|ft|sing=on}} [[Romerike Tunnel]] from [[Etterstad]], beside Oslo Central Station, to Lillestr<U+00F8>m<ref name=jbvstat45 /><U+2014>the longest railway tunnel in Norway, located underneath the geological highly unstable recreational area [[<U+00D8>stmarka]]. In 1997, the water level in some of the lakes above the tunnel, including [[Lutvann]] and [[Nordre Puttjern]], sank dramatically. After the leakages were discovered on 3 February 1997, sanctions requiring leakage removals were initiated by the [[Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate]]. At the worst the tunnel leaked {{convert|3000|l|impgal}} of water per minute.<ref name=romeriksporten>{{Cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/sd/dok/NOUer/1999/NOU-1999-28/4/2/6.html?id=355320 |title=S<U+00E6>rskilt om Romeriksporten |author=[[Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications]] |year=1999 |accessdate=2008-09-13 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

The substance [[Rhoca-Gil]] was used to attempt fix the leakages, but failed to work properly. Not only did it not polymerize and fail to tighten the leak, it also intoxicated the surroundings with [[acrylamide]]. Manual fixing with concrete became necessary; the fixing and cleaning up of the toxin delayed the building of the tunnel by one year.<ref name=romeriksporten /> Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company, Scandinavian Rock Group, with the latter at one instance stopping work for three weeks while the parties quarreled in court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tekst.aftenposten.no/tekstcgi/tekst.cgi?stdsok=atekst&base=AFT97&q1=AFT9704140240 |title=NSB og SRG barket sammen i namsretten |author=[[Aftenposten]] |date=1997-04-14 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

Reports have shown lack of control- and reporting procedures during incidents that should have been addressed<U+2014>but never taken seriously<U+2014>in 1995. About sixty houses received damages due to the construction of the tunnel and an evaluation by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications|Ministry of Transport and Communications]] showed NOK 500&nbsp;million went to fixing the leaks; claiming this to a large extent was unnecessary expenditure due to inefficient engineering procedures. It also criticized the administrative planning and organization of the overall construction of the railway.<ref name=romeriksporten />

When the new airport opened on 8 October 1998, the Airport Express Train started operations; the trains had to use the old Trunk Line line from Oslo S to Lillestr<U+00F8>m, but could use the new high-speed line from Lillestr<U+00F8>m to Gardermoen. Flytoget was forced to only operate two trains per hour due to capacity restraints on Hovedbanen. Regular operations at full capacity using the Romerike Tunnel started on 22 August 1999.<ref name=history />

===Reorganization===
[[Image:TRS 061028 027.jpg|thumb|A Class 71 unit beside an [[NSB Class 70|Class 70]] unit at [[Asker Station]]]]
Estimates for the project costs were NOK&nbsp;4.3&nbsp;billion, <U+00B1>20%, but by completion they had ended at NOK&nbsp;7.7&nbsp;billion, of which NOK&nbsp;1.3&nbsp;billion were related to the leakages. The rest of the line had a cost exceedings of NOK&nbsp;0.4&nbsp;billion. The company had acquired [[interest|financial costs]] of NOK&nbsp;0.9&nbsp;billion, so the company owed NOK&nbsp;10.0&nbsp;billion by 1999, including money spent on the new trains.<ref name=history />

The first steps of organizational restructure were taken 29 June 2000, when the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of NSB, [[Osmund Ueland]], was fired due to several incidents related to the operations of NSB<U+2014>not just the Gardermo Line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=7694863 |title=Ueland fikk sparken i NSB |author=Norsk Telegrambyr<U+00E5> |publisher=[[Verdens Gang]] |date=2000-06-29 |accessdate=2008-09-13 |language=Norwegian |authorlink=Norwegian News Agency}}</ref> [[Einar Enger]] took over as new CEO on 26 February 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/meninger/artikkel.php?artid=1515882 |title=Ny mann p<U+00E5> nytt spor? |author=Verdens Gang |date=2001-02-26 |accessdate=2008-09-13 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

The debt in NSB Gardermobanen had become unmanageable, and in April 2000 parliament accepted that it would not be possible to make the Gardermo Line<U+2014>with the current structure<U+2014>the profitable venture predicted in 1992. From 1 January 2001, the company changed name to Flytoget AS, retaining ownership of the trains and operations and kept as a subsidiary of NSB. The tracks and infrastructure were transferred to the [[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] ({{lang|no|Jernbaneverket}}), who owns the rest of the [[rail transport in Norway|Norwegian railway network]]. All debt was restored and covered by the state, and a vehicle excise duty was implemented on the Gardermo Line to cover the management and maintenance of the line, to be paid by all users.<ref name=history />

On 9 December 2002, parliament decided that Flytoget AS would become a separate [[railway company]] from 1 January 2003, owned directly by the Ministry of Transport and Communications.<ref name=history /> One year later the ownership was transferred to the Ministry of Trade and Industry as part of a cleanup of political overhaul between the departments.<ref name=boarding04>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boarding.no/art.asp?id=11101 |title=Flytoget til N<U+00E6>rings- og handelsdepartementet |author=Boarding |date=2004-02-12 |accessdate=2008-09-13 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> As part of the process, a new CEO, [[Thomas Havnegjerde]], was appointed in June 2002,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flytoget.no/eng/About-Flytoget/About-the-Organisation |title=About the Organisation |author=Flytoget |accessdate=2008-05-24}}</ref> and in January 2003 the new Chair, [[Endre Skj<U+00F8>restad]]<U+2014>who took over the position form NSB's director Einar Enger.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boarding.no/art.asp?art=6296 |title=Endre Skj<U+00F8>restad ny styreleder |author=Boarding |accessdate=2008-09-13 |date=2003-01-23}}</ref> Havnegjerde announced on 6 August 2008 that he would retire from his job before the end of the year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.na24.no/article2113616.ece |title=Toppsjef begynneri barnehage |author=Lorentzen, Magdalena |publisher=[[NA24]] |date=2008-08-06 |accessdate=2008-09-14 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> He was replaced by [[Linda Bernander Silseth]] on 10 November 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flytoget.no/eng/About-Flytoget/Press/Pressemeldinger/Linda-Bernander-Silseth-ny-administrerende-direkt%C3%B8r-i-Flytoget |title=Linda Bernander Silseth ny administrerende direkt<U+00F8>r i Flytoget |author=Flytoget |date=2008-10-24 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=2008-05-24}} {{Dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot}}</ref> On 30 August 2009, two of three services to Asker were extended to Drammen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flytoget.no/nor/content/view/full/448 |title=2 Flytog i timen fra Drammen |author=Flytoget |date=2009-06-23 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref> This followed upgrades to the Drammen Line, including the [[Lier<U+00E5>sen Tunnel]], and a new parking lot at [[Drammen Station]], in total costing NOK&nbsp;20&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/sd/Press-Centre/Press-releases/2007/Flytoget--til-Drammen-fra-juni-2008.html?id=460936 |author=[[Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications]] |title=Flytoget- til Drammen fr<U+00E5> juni 2008 |date=2007-03-27 |accessdate=2008-09-13 |language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/incoming/article.jhtml?articleID=1693207 |title=Flytoget til Drammen |author=Norwegian National Rail Administration |date=2007-03-23 |accessdate=2008-09-13 |language=Norwegian|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070811104140/http://www.jernbaneverket.no/incoming/article.jhtml?articleID=1693207 |archivedate = August 11, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

==Operations==
{{Flytoget map}}
Departures operate every ten minutes from Oslo Central Station (Oslo&nbsp;S) to the airport. Half of the trains originate in Drammen, making five intermediate stops before Oslo&nbsp;S, and again at Lillestr<U+00F8>m. The other half go directly from Oslo&nbsp;S to Gardermoen. On Saturdays, Sunday mornings and in most of July, Flytoget does not operate the direct trains from Oslo&nbsp;S<U+2014>only the 20-minute [[headway]] all-stop trains.<ref name=time>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flytoget.no/nor/content/download/395/2899/version/2/file/FLY+infokort+No+Fra_+Jun.08_.pdf |title=From Oslo Airport |author=Flytoget AS |date=2008-01-06 |accessdate=2008-09-13  |format=PDF}} {{Dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot}}</ref> While the services northeast from Oslo&nbsp;S to the airport use the high-speed Gardermo Line, those westwards towards Asker use the [[Drammen Line]] built in 1870<U+2013>72;<ref name=jbvstat45 /> so while the {{convert|48|km|mi}} from Oslo&nbsp;S to the airport can be done in 19&nbsp;minutes, the {{convert|24|km|mi}} from Asker to Oslo&nbsp;S takes 26&nbsp;minutes.

Several deaths have taken place on the route, but only one due to an accident. In 1999, an employee of the National Rail Administration was killed by a train because it was operating at {{convert|160|km/h|mph}} instead of the temporarily reduced limit of {{convert|80|km/h|mph}}; Flytoget was fined for not informing the engineer of the speed limit reduction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=169292 |title=Flytoget b<U+00F8>telagt etter d<U+00F8>dsulykke |author=Norsk Telegrambyr<U+00E5> |publisher=Verdens Gang |date=2001-02-21 |accessdate=2008-06-30 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Several other deaths on the line have been classified as [[suicide]]s, and so are not in the accident statistics;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jernbanetilsynet.no/upload/documents/Publikasjoner/Statisitikk/rsstatistikk_ulykker/Ulykkesstatistikk_2002.pdf |title=Ulykkesstatisktikk 2002 |author=[[Norwegian Railway Inspectorate]] |accessdate=2008-06-30 |language=Norwegian |pages=4| format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=3893031 |title= - Satt i skinnegangen da toget kom |author=Verdens Gang |date=2001-01-26 |accessdate=2008-06-30 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> they do however cause delays on all services for hours after the incident takes place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article2136315.ece |title=Fullt tog-kaos p<U+00E5> Romerike |author=Ihleb<U+00E6>k, Jostein and Holm, Per Annar |publisher=Aftenposten |date=2007-12-04 |accessdate=2008-06-30 |language=Norwegian |pages=4}}</ref>

Delays have been experienced many times by travelers due to technical problems on the infrastructure.

During the [[Air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull eruption|2010 volcano air travel disruption]], the Gardermoen airport was closed for a period, and the Flytoget trains were used by NSB instead, to give extra train capacity for long-distance routes.<ref>[http://www.nsb.no/aktuelt/flytog-paa-strekningen-oslo-halden-article35410-2707.html Flytog p<U+00E5> strekningen Oslo - Halden]</ref>

===Plans===
In 2005, the first part of the [[Asker Line]] opened between Sandvika and Asker, with new double track running parallel to the old Drammen Line, allowing quicker travel times to Asker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/prosjekter/pagaende/skoyen_asker/sandvika_asker/article.jhtml?articleID=1641536 |title=Sandvika-Asker <U+00E5>pnet |author=Norwegian National Rail Administration |date=2005-08-29 |accessdate=2008-09-13 |language=Norwegian}} {{Dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot}}</ref> The second section, between Lysaker and Sandvika, is planned to open in 2011, and will reduce travel time west of Lysaker by about seven minutes.

{{Main|GMB Class 71}}
[[Image:Flytoget innvendig.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Airport Express Train]]
The company operates sixteen [[GMB Class 71|Class 71]] three-car [[electric multiple unit]]s delivered in 1997<U+2013>98, and built domestically by [[Adtranz]] at [[Str<U+00F8>mmens V<U+00E6>rksted|Str<U+00F8>mmen]] based on carbodies built in [[Adtranz]] factory in [[Kalmar]]. They are based on the Swedish [[SJ X2|X2]] operated by [[SJ AB|SJ]] in their [[X 2000]] intercity service, and developed by [[Kalmar Verkstad]] during the 1980s. The Class 71 are nearly identical to the [[NSB Class 73]], save the 71-series lacking one car and [[tilting train|tilting mechanism]], and a different interior. Both have chosen to not use the original [[locomotive]] design, instead installing one powered [[bogie]] in each car. The 71-series is built for a maximum operating speed of {{convert|210|km/h|mph}}, but has achieved higher speeds in test runs.<ref name=elektrolok>{{Cite book|first=Nils Carl |last=Aspenberg |authorlink=Nils Carl Aspenberg |title=Elektrolok i Norge |year=2001 |publisher=[[Baneforlaget]] |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian |isbn=82-91448-42-6}}</ref>

Among the features are pressure-tight cabins to allow comfortable travel through tunnels at high speeds, and step-free access to the cars. Instead steps are inside the trains; this has been criticized to be in non-conformance with public [[accessibility]] policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shdir.no/srff/fagnytt/langt_igjen_til_universell_utforming__66999 |title=Langt igjen til universell utforming |author=[[Norwegian State Council on Disability]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> The multiple units can only operate in fixed sets of three cars, but up to three sets can be [[multiple-unit train control|run in multiple]]. Flytoget regularly uses double sets to create six-car trains.<ref name=elektrolok /> In 2008<U+2013>09, all units will be refit with an additional middle car by [[Bombardier Transportation]], increasing capacity by 40% to 244 seats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flytoget.no/eng/About-Flytoget/Press/Pressemeldinger/Flytoget-inng%C3%A5r-kontrakt-med-Bombardier-Transportation |title=Flytoget inng<U+00E5>r kontrakt med Bombardier Transportation om kj<U+00F8>p av nye mellomvogner |author=Flytoget AS |language=Norwegian |accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref>

Unlike the Class 71, the sister trains in service with NSB were prone to trouble, having to operate on hundred-year-old infrastructure on cross-mountain services; the Class 71 has more lenient operating conditions thanks to better infrastructure. The only incident to ground all the BM71 trains occurred on the 17 June 2000 at [[Nelaug Station|Nelaug]] when a Class 73 train operated by NSB [[derail]]ed because of stress on the axle. Unlike the NSB trains, the airport express trains were back in service the next day,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=7373144 |title=Utmatting <U+00E5>rsak til avsporing |author=Norsk Telegrambyr<U+00E5> |publisher=Verdens Gang |date=2000-06-18 |accessdate=2008-09-13 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> while the 73-series had to wait another month.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=6574318 |title=Signatur endelig i drift |author=Norsk Telegrambyr<U+00E5> |publisher=Verdens Gang |date=2000-07-13 |accessdate=2008-09-13 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> On 24 January 2004 a unit had to be taken out of service due to smoke from a stressed [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]<U+2014>within days the bearings were replaced on all units.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=264980 |title=M<U+00E5> skifte alle hjullagre i Flytogene |author=Norsk Telegrambyr<U+00E5> |publisher=Verdens Gang |date=2005-01-31 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref>
