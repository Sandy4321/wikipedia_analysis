'''New York State Route&nbsp;148''' ('''NY&nbsp;148''') is a [[state highway]] in [[Niagara County, New York]], in the United States. It runs in a north<U+2013>south direction for {{convert|7.53|mi}} between an intersection with [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] in the town of [[Hartland, New York|Hartland]] and a junction with [[New York State Route 18|NY&nbsp;18]] north of the village of [[Barker, Niagara County, New York|Barker]] in the town of [[Somerset, New York|Somerset]]. The entire length of NY&nbsp;148 is named Quaker Road and maintained by Niagara County as part of [[County Route 15 (Niagara County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;15]] (CR&nbsp;15). The [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] county route number is [[unsigned highway|unsigned]], as are all county routes in Niagara County. NY&nbsp;148 was assigned in 1960, supplementing the preexisting CR&nbsp;15.

== Route description ==
[[File:NY 148 north in Barker.jpg|left|thumb|NY&nbsp;148 northbound through the village of Barker]] 
NY&nbsp;148 begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] ([[Ridge Road (Western New York)|Ridge Road]]) and Quaker Road in the town of [[Hartland, New York|Hartland]], just east of the Hartland Central Cemetery. The highway proceeds north through Hartland as a two-lane rural road, maintained by Niagara County as part of [[County Route 15 (Niagara County, New York)|CR&nbsp;15]]. NY&nbsp;148 proceeds north, running along a short residential strip before the intersection with Chapman Road. After Chapman Road, NY&nbsp;148 continues to pass homes until its junction with Seaman Road, where it enters more rural surroundings. The route crosses a canal as it proceeds northward through Hartland, bending northeast into the town of [[Somerset, New York|Somerset]] at Town Line Road.<ref name="bing">{{bing maps |url=http://binged.it/KLSSlK |title=overview map of NY&nbsp;148|accessdate=June 7, 2012}}</ref> 

In Somerset, NY&nbsp;148 remains a two-lane roadway, passing through sparsely developed areas on its way to the village of [[Barker, Niagara County, New York|Barker]]. In the southern part of the community, the route meets Coleman and West Somerset roads ([[County Route 2 (Niagara County, New York)|CR&nbsp;2]] and [[County Route 3 (Niagara County, New York)|CR&nbsp;3]], respectively). Through Barker, NY&nbsp;148 is a two-lane residential street, passing west of Barker Free Library and east of Barker High School. After Haight Road, NY&nbsp;148 leaves the village, continuing north through a lightly populated area. At Arlington Road, the number of homes along NY&nbsp;148 rises once again as the route enters the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of [[Somerset (hamlet), New York|Somerset]], located at the junction of NY&nbsp;148 and [[New York State Route 18|NY&nbsp;18]] (Lake Road). This junction serves as the northern terminus of NY&nbsp;148, while CR&nbsp;15 continues north through Somerset towards [[Lake Ontario]].<ref name="bing" />

==History==
Quaker Road was established as a north<U+2013>south highway between [[Hartland, New York|Hartland]] and [[Somerset, New York|Somerset]] sometime prior to 1897.<ref>{{cite map |url=http://docs.unh.edu/NY/olct97se.jpg |title=New York (Niagara Co.) <U+2013> Olcott Sheet |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |year=1897 |scale=1:62,500 |accessdate=December 29, 2012}}</ref> By 1915, the segment of Quaker Road between [[Ridge Road (Western New York)|Ridge Road]] and Lake Road in the hamlet of Somerset was taken over by Niagara County and designated as CR&nbsp;15. On March&nbsp;10, 1915, the county awarded a contract worth $65,258 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|65258|1915|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) to rebuild the highway. Construction on the road began sometime around May&nbsp;1, and it was reopened to traffic around November&nbsp;1. The project finished slightly over-budget with a final cost of $65,554 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|65554|1915|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}).<ref>{{cite news |title=Supervisors Proceedings: Final Report and Estimate on County Road No. 15 |newspaper=Lockport Union-Sun & Journal |date=February 12, 1916 |page=7}}</ref>{{Inflation-fn|US}} A celebration commemorating the completion of the rebuilt road was organized by the [[Barker, Niagara County, New York|Barker]] Chamber of Commerce and held on December&nbsp;6, 1915.<ref>{{cite news |title=Barker Village to Celebrate; Chamber of Commerce Will Give Dinner in Honor of Completion of Highway |newspaper=[[Niagara Falls Gazette]] |date=December 4, 1915 |page=4}}</ref> The portion of Quaker Road between Ridge and Lake roads (then [[U.S. Route&nbsp;104]] and [[New York State Route 18|NY&nbsp;18]], respectively) was designated as NY&nbsp;148 by the state of New York in 1960;<ref name="1960usj">{{cite news |title=Touring Route Set In Barker |newspaper=[[Lockport Union-Sun & Journal]] |date=February 15, 1960 |page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York and Metropolitan New York |publisher=[[Sunoco]] |cartography=[[H.M.
