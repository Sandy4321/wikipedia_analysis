==History==
[[Image:Preziosi - Arn<U+0103>ut, 1866.jpg|thumb|left|180px|An Albanian in [[Wallachia]] (1866 watercolor by [[Amadeo Preziosi]])]]
An Albanian community inside the [[Danubian Principalities]] was first attested in [[Wallachia]] under [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Michael the Brave]]: a report drafted by [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] authorities in [[Transylvania]] specified that 15,000 Albanians had been allowed to cross north of the [[Danube]] in 1595; C<U+0103>line<U+015F>ti (a village in present-day [[Flore<U+015F>ti, Prahova|Flore<U+015F>ti]], [[Prahova County]]) was one of their places of settlement, as evidenced in a document issued by Michael's rival and successor, [[Simion Movil<U+0103>]], who confirmed their right to reside in the locality.<ref name="divers">{{Ro icon}} [http://www.divers.ro/albanezi_istoric_ro "Albanezii - Scurt istoric"] at [http://www.divers.ro/ ''Divers'' online]; retrieved February 26, 2008</ref> The community's presence was first recorded in Bucharest around 1628.<ref>Giurescu, p.272</ref> In [[Moldavia]], an ethnic Albanian, [[Vasile Lupu]], became [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] in 1634.<ref name="divers"/>

The Albanian community was strengthened during the [[Phanariotes|Phanariote epoch]], when numerous immigrants opened businesses in a large number of cities and towns, and were employed as bodyguards of Wallachian princes and [[boyars]] (being usually recorded as ''arb<U+0103>na<U+015F>i'', akin to ''[[Arvanites]]'', and its variant ''arn<U+0103>u<U+0163>i'', borrowed from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''[[Arnauts|arnaut]]'').<ref name="divers"/><ref>Giurescu, p.267, 272</ref> In 1820, a survey indicated that there were 90 traders from the [[Rumelia]]n town of [[Arnaut Kioy]] present in the Wallachian capital, most of whom were probably Albanians and [[Aromanians]].<ref>Giurescu, p.267</ref>

The ''[[National awakening and the birth of Albania|Rilindja Komb<U+00EB>tare]]'' movement of Albanian [[nationalism]] inside the [[Ottoman Empire]] was present and prolific in Wallachia, the center of cultural initiatives taken by [[Dora d'Istria]], [[Naim Frash<U+00EB>ri]], [[Jani Vreto]], and [[Naum Veqilharxhi]] (the latter published the first ever Albanian [[Textbook|primer]] in Bucharest, in 1844).<ref name="divers"/> [[Aleksander Stavre Drenova]], a resident of Bucharest, authored the lyrics of Albania's national anthem, ''[[Hymni i Flamurit]]'', which is sung to the tune of ''Pe-al nostru steag e scris Unire'', composed by the Romanian [[Ciprian Porumbescu]].<ref name="divers"/> At the time, Albanians were present, alongside other Balkan communities, in Bucharest's commercial life, where many worked as street vendors (specializing in the sale of [[soft drinks]] or [[confectionery]] items).<ref>Giurescu, p.168, 307</ref>

In 1893, the Albanian community in Romania numbered around 30,000 persons. In 1920 almost 20,000 Albanians lived in Bucharest.<ref name="divers"/> A new wave of Albanian immigrants, many of them Muslims from [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]],<ref name="divers"/> followed in the wake of [[World War I]].<ref name="grigoremuslimsinro"/><ref name="divers"/> In 1921, the first translation of the ''[[Qur'an]]'' into [[Albanian language|Albanian]] was completed by [[Ilo Mitke Qaf<U+00EB>zezi]] and published in the city of [[Ploie<U+015F>ti]].<ref name="grigoremuslimsinro"/> Many Albanians settled in [[Transylvania]], where they generally established confectionery enterprises.<ref name="divers"/> 

The community was repressed under the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], starting in 1953 (when the Albanian cultural association was closed down).<ref name="diverscontemp"/> Rights lost were regained after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], but the number of people declaring themselves Albanian has decreased dramatically between 1920 and 2002.<ref name="diversdemo"/><ref name="diverscontemp"/> Traditionally, members of the community have been included among a special "among others" category in the censuses, but have first received a special seat in [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] after the [[Romanian legislative election, 2000|2000 elections]].<ref name="diversdemo"/>
