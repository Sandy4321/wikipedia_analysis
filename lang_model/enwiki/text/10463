'''''Banksia aquilonia''''' is a [[tree]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Proteaceae]] native to north [[Queensland]] on Australia's northeastern coastline. Reaching 8&nbsp;m (25&nbsp;ft) high, it has long narrow glossy green leaves up to 20&nbsp;cm (8&nbsp;in) long and 6 to 10&nbsp;cm (2.4 to 4&nbsp;in) high pale yellow flower spikes, known as [[inflorescence]]s, appearing in autumn. As the spikes age, their flowers fall off and they develop up to 50 [[follicle (fruit)|follicles]] each, each of which contains two seeds. 

[[Alex George]] described the plant in his 1981 [[monograph]] of the genus ''[[Banksia]]'' as a [[Variety (botany)|variety]] of ''[[Banksia integrifolia]]'', but later reclassified as a separate species. Genetic studies show it to be related to ''[[Banksia plagiocarpa]]'', ''[[Banksia oblongifolia]]'' and ''[[Banksia robur]]''. The species is found in wet [[sclerophyll]] forest and rainforest margins on sandy soils. ''Banksia aquilonia'' regenerates after [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfire]] by regrowing from [[epicormic shoot|epicormic buds]] under its bark. It is rarely cultivated.

==Taxonomy==
{{see also|Taxonomy of Banksia}}
''Banksia aquilonia'' was first described by [[Alex George]] in 1981 as a [[Variety (botany)|variety]] of ''[[Banksia integrifolia]]'' (Coast Banksia), from a specimen collected at Witts Lookout in Crystal Creek National Park south of [[Ingham, Queensland|Ingham]] on 12 April 1975.<ref name = "George 1981">{{cite journal | last = George | first = Alex S. | year = 1981 | title = [[The genus Banksia L.f.

On this basis they would have liked to promote it to species rank, but did not because their inferred [[phylogeny]] suggested that this taxon arose from within ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia''. They were unwilling to render ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' [[paraphyletic]] by promoting this taxon to species rank, and they were equally unwilling to promote all four varieties to species rank, since the others all had significant overlaps in distribution and morphology. Therefore they simply promoted all four to subspecies rank.<ref name="Thiele 1996">{{cite journal | last1 = Thiele | first1 = Kevin | authorlink1=Kevin Thiele | last2 = Ladiges | first2 = Pauline Y. | year = 1996 | title = A Cladistic Analysis of ''Banksia'' (Proteaceae) | journal = [[Australian Systematic Botany]] | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 661<U+2013>733 | doi = 10.1071/SB9960661}}</ref> This case has since been held up as an interesting case study on how the concept of ''species'' should be defined, as it presents the problem of "a monophyletic group comprising a paraphyletic basal group of incompletely differentiated geographic forms within which is nested at least one divergent, [[autapomorphy|autapomorphic]] taxon that invites treatment as a species."<ref name="Crisp 1996">{{cite journal | last1 = Crisp | first1 = Michael D. | last2= Chandler | first2 = Greg T. | year = 1996 | title = Paraphyletic Species | journal = Telopea | volume = 6 | pages = 813<U+2013>44|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/BoZo/Crisp/pdfs/Crisp1996_paraspecies.pdf|issn= 0312-9764}}</ref>

In 1996, George, who has no objection to paraphyletic taxa, promoted it to species rank.<ref name = "George 1996"/> Thus its full name with author citation is "''Banksia aquilonia'' (A.S.George) A.S.George". It is placed in subgenus [[Banksia subg. Banksia|''Banksia'']], section [[Banksia sect. Banksia|''Banksia'']] and series ''[[Banksia ser. Salicinae|Salicinae]]''.  Its placement within ''Banksia'' may be summarised as follows:<ref name="George 1999"/>

Despite initially assigning it varietal level of ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'', George noted that it had affinities with the then newly described species ''[[Banksia plagiocarpa]]'', which it co-occurs with on and near [[Hinchinbrook Island]] in north Queensland.<ref name = "George 1981"/>

Since 1998, American botanist [[Austin Mast]] and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of [[DNA sequence]] data for ''Banksia'' and ''[[Banksia ser. Dryandra|Dryandra]]''. Their analyses suggest a [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]] that differs greatly from George's [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] arrangement.
