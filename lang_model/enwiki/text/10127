'''No. 77 Squadron''' is a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) squadron headquartered at [[RAAF Base Williamtown]], New South Wales. Controlled by [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;81 Wing]], it is equipped with [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]] multi-role fighters. The squadron was formed at [[RAAF Base Pearce|RAAF Station Pearce]], Western Australia, in March 1942 and saw action in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War&nbsp;II]], operating [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk variants|Curtis P-40 Kittyhawks]]. After the war, it re-equipped with [[North American P-51 Mustang]]s and deployed to Japan as part of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]]. The squadron was about to return to Australia when the [[Korean War]] broke out in June 1950, after which it joined [[United Nations]] forces supporting South Korea. It converted to [[Gloster Meteor]] jets in April 1951 and remained in Korea until October 1954, suffering twenty-five per cent casualties during the war.

The squadron re-equipped with [[CAC Sabre]]s at Williamtown in November 1956. Two years later it transferred to [[RMAF Butterworth|RAAF Butterworth]] in [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] to join the air campaign against communist guerrillas in the last stages of the [[Malayan Emergency|Emergency]]. The squadron remained at Butterworth during the 1960s, providing regional air defence during the [[Indonesia<U+2013>Malaysia confrontation|''Konfrontasi'']] between Indonesia and Malaysia. It returned to Williamtown in early 1969 to re-equip with [[Dassault Mirage&nbsp;III]] supersonic jet fighters. The squadron began converting to Hornets in June 1987. It supplied a detachment of four aircraft to the [[United States Air Force]] base on [[Diego Garcia]] in 2001<U+2013>02, supporting the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|war in Afghanistan]]. The RAAF plans to replace its Hornets with [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning&nbsp;II]] fighters commencing in 2018, and No.&nbsp;77 Squadron is scheduled to convert to the new type in 2021.

==History==
===World War II and occupation of Japan===
As the Japanese advanced in the South West Pacific during early 1942, the RAAF hurriedly established three new fighter units equipped with [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk variants|Curtiss P-40E Kittyhawks]] recently delivered from the United States: [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&nbsp;75]], [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|76]] and 77 Squadrons.<ref name=Stephens139>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 139<U+2013>141</ref> No.&nbsp;77 Squadron was formed at [[RAAF Base Pearce|RAAF Station Pearce]], Western Australia, on 16&nbsp;March, with a complement of three officers and 100 men.

China entered the war in mid-October 1950, as advancing UN troops closed on the [[Yalu River]]. No.&nbsp;77 Squadron undertook its first sorties against Chinese ground forces on 1&nbsp;November.<ref name=Solo229>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 229</ref>  The squadron flew its first missions supporting the [[Australian Army]] on 5&nbsp;November, when it attacked Chinese troops opposing the [[3rd&nbsp;Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]], at [[Pakchon County|Pakchon]].<ref name=Eather201>Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', p. 102</ref><ref>Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', p. 84</ref> No.&nbsp;77 Squadron personnel were housed in tents in freezing conditions at Pohung; two pilots died as a result of a fire in their quarters on 14&nbsp;November.<ref>Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', pp. 100<U+2013>101</ref> Two days later the Australians began moving forward with the 35th Group to Yonpo, near [[Hamhung]].<ref name=Eather201/><ref>Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', p. 80</ref> North Korea's counter-attack, supported by Chinese forces, led to the squadron being withdrawn to [[Pusan]] on 3&nbsp;December 1950.<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 231</ref> The Chinese operated a Russian-designed swept-wing jet fighter, the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]], that outclassed all other fighters in the theatre except the new [[North American F-86 Sabre]]. The RAAF attempted to procure Sabres to replace No.&nbsp;77 Squadron's Mustangs but the priority being given to re-equipping the USAF meant that deliveries would not be possible until 1954. The Australian government agreed to purchase [[Gloster Meteor]] straight-wing jet fighters from Britain as the only viable alternative.<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 229<U+2013>230</ref>  No.&nbsp;77 Squadron completed its last Mustang mission on 6&nbsp;April 1951 and returned to Iwakuni the next day to begin converting to Meteors.  It subsequently transferred to [[Gimpo|Kimpo]], South Korea, and commenced operations with its new aircraft on 29&nbsp;July.<ref>Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', pp. 119, 126</ref><ref>Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', pp. 126, 142</ref> The squadron was initially equipped with twenty-two Meteors, and came under the control of the USAF's [[4th Fighter Wing|4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing]]. Although it had operated effectively as a ground-attack unit with its Mustangs, No.&nbsp;77 Squadron's primary role in the RAAF was interception, and it was expected that with the Meteor it could again focus on fighter duties, particularly as by this stage the USAF had only two squadrons of Sabres in the theatre.<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 231<U+2013>233</ref>

Cresswell was succeeded by Wing Commander [[Gordon Steege]] on 16&nbsp;August 1951, by which time No.&nbsp;77 Squadron's Meteors had conducted offensive sweeps up the Yalo River with USAF Sabres, and escorted [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]es on bombing missions.<ref name=Solo234>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 234</ref><ref name=Hurst143>Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', pp. 143<U+2013>145</ref> MiG-15s had appeared on several occasions without engaging the Meteors; it was speculated at the time, and subsequently ascertained, that they had been observing the performance of the newly arrived RAAF jets.<ref name=Hurst143/><ref>Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', pp. 126<U+2013>127</ref>  No.&nbsp;77 Squadron's first Meteor fatalities occurred on 22&nbsp;August, when two aircraft collided in mid-air as they returned to Kimpo after a sweep.<ref name=Hurst143/><ref name=Fighter58>RAAF Historical Section, ''Fighter Units'', p. 58</ref> The Meteors first engaged MiG-15s on 25&nbsp;August, but no hits were scored. Four days later, eight Meteors and sixteen Sabres fought twelve MiGs; one RAAF pilot ejected when his aircraft was shot down, and a second Meteor was badly damaged. One week later another Meteor suffered severe damage in a dogfight with MiGs.<ref name=Solo234/><ref name=Hurst147>Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', pp. 147<U+2013>151</ref> As a result of these clashes, Steege became convinced that the Meteor was outclassed as a fighter and, following discussions with the Fifth Air Force, decided to take No.&nbsp;77 Squadron out of its air-to-air combat role and curtail its operations in "[[MiG Alley]]". This caused controversy among observers who believed that proper tactics exploiting the Meteor's maneuverability and heavy armament would have allowed it to remain competitive as a fighter, while for the Australian pilots the change of role amounted to a loss of prestige.<ref name=Stephens>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 236<U+2013>237</ref><ref>O'Neill, ''Combat Operations'', p. 358</ref> The decision was backed by the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], and the squadron was relegated mainly to escort duty and local air defence. Morale suffered and it was not until after Steege was succeeded by Wing Commander Ron Susans on 26&nbsp;December that a suitable offensive role was again found for the Meteors, namely ground attack.<ref name=Stephens/><ref name=Wilson>Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', pp. 181<U+2013>182</ref>
