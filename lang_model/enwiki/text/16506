The '''Commodore 64''' personal computer, released in August 1982, became the best selling single computer model of all time, according to the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]''. The Commodore 64 is commonly referred to as the '''C64'''; other less common names include '''CBM 64'''/'''CBM64''', '''C= 64'''. The Commodore 64 casing has affectionately been nicknamed the "breadbox" and "bullnose" due to its shape.

The C64 competed in the fractured personal computer industry with the [[Commodore PET]] and the [[VIC-20]], among others. Introduced by [[Commodore International|Commodore Business Machines]] in August 1982 at the low price of [[United States dollar|US$]]595, it offered 64&nbsp;[[kilobyte]]s of [[RAM]] with sound and graphics performance that compared favourably with later IBM compatible computers of that time. During the Commodore 64's lifetime (between 1982 and 1994), sales totaled around 17 million units <ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.c64/msg/d5b890f317d972fd?q=commodore+annual+report+1986&start=10&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&rnum=13] (Marc Walters, citing 1993 Commodore Annual Report) web site - URL last accessed [[30 April]] [[2006]].</ref>.

Unlike computers that were distributed only through authorized dealers, Commodore also targeted [[department store]]s and toy stores. The unit could be plugged directly into a television set to play games, giving it much of the appeal of dedicated [[video game console]]s like the [[Atari 2600]]. Its affordable pricing contributed to the [[video game crash of 1983|video game market crash of 1983]].

Approximately 10,000 [[software]] titles were made for the Commodore 64 including development tools, office applications, and games. The machine is also credited with popularizing the computer [[demoscene|demo scene]]. The Commodore 64 is still used today by many computer hobbyists and emulators allow anyone with a modern computer to run these programs on their desktop (with varying degrees of success and functionality).

==History==
===Origins===
[[Image:C64 artistic closeup.jpg|left|thumb|180px|A Close-up of C64.]]

In January 1981, [[MOS Technology|MOS Technology, Inc.]], Commodore's [[Integrated circuit|integrated-circuit]] design subsidiary, initiated a project to design the graphic and audio chips for a next generation [[video game console]]. Design work for the chips, named [[MOS Technology VIC-II]] (graphics) and [[MOS Technology SID]] (audio),  was completed in November 1981.

A game console project was then initiated by Commodore that would use the new chips -- called the ''Ultimax'' or alternatively the ''[[Commodore MAX Machine]]'', engineered by [[Yashi Terakura]] from Commodore Japan. This project was eventually cancelled after just a few machines were manufactured for the Japanese market.

At the same time in mid-1981, [[Robert Russell (engineer)|Robert Russell]] (system programmer and architect on the VIC-20) and [[Robert Yannes|Robert "Bob" Yannes]] (engineer of the SID) were critical of the current product line-up at Commodore, which was a continuation of the [[Commodore PET]] line aimed at business users. Instead, with the support of [[Al Charpentier]] (engineer of the VIC-II) and [[Charles Winterble]] (manager of MOS Technology) they proposed a true low-cost sequel to the VIC-20 to Commodore CEO [[Jack Tramiel]]. Tramiel dictated that the machine should have 64KB of RAM memory since prices on the memory market were declining. Although 64 kB of RAM cost over US $100 at the time, he knew that [[DRAM]] prices were falling, and would drop to an acceptable level before full production was reached.
Tramiel also set a deadline for the 1982 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], in the first weekend of January. The meeting was in November so this gave the engineers about two months to complete working prototypes for the show.

The product was [[codename]]d the '''VIC-40''' as the successor to the popular '''VIC-20'''. The team that constructed it consisted of Robert Russell, Robert "Bob" Yannes and David A. Ziembicki. The design, prototypes and some sample software was finished in time for the show, after the team had worked tirelessly over both Thanksgiving and Christmas weekends.

When the product was to be presented, the VIC-40 product was renamed '''C64''' in order to fit into the current Commodore business products lineup which contained the ''P128'' and the ''B256'', both named by a letter and their respective memory size.

The C64 made an impressive debut, as recalled by Production Engineer David A. Ziembicki: "All we saw at our booth were Atari people with their mouths dropping open, saying, 'How can you do that for $595?'" The answer, as it turned out, was [[vertical integration]]; thanks to Commodore's ownership of [[MOS Technology]]'s [[semiconductor fabrication]] facilities, each C64 had an estimated production cost of only $135.

===Winning the market war===
The C64 faced a wide range of competing [[home computer]]s at its introduction in August 1982. With an impressive price point coupled with the 64's advanced hardware, it quickly out-classed many of its competitors. In the [[United States]] the greatest competitors to the C64 were the [[Atari 8-bit|Atari 400/800]], [[IBM PC]] and [[Apple II]]. The [[Atari]] 400/800 was very similar in hardware terms, but it was very expensive to build, which forced Atari to redesign their machine to be more cost effective. This resulted in the 600XL/800XL line and the transfer of their production to the Far East. The IBM PC and the now aging Apple II were no match for the C64's graphical and sound abilities, but they were very expandable with their internal expansion slots, a feature lacking in the 64. 

All three machines had a standard memory configuration of 16K, 48K less RAM than the C64. At US$1,500, the IBM PC and Apple II were 3 times more expensive, while the Atari 800 cost a mere $899.  One key to the C64's success was Commodore's aggressive marketing tactics, and they were quick to exploit the relative price/performance divisions between its competitors with a series of television commercials after the C64's launch in late 1982. [http://www.commodorebillboard.de/Commercials/Commodore/english/CommodoreCommercialsEnglish.htm]

Commodore sold the C64 not only through its network of authorized dealers, but also placed it on the shelves of department stores, discount stores, and toy stores. Since it had the ability to output [[composite video]], the C64 did not require a specialized monitor, but could be plugged into a television set. This allowed it (like its predecessor, the VIC-20) to compete directly against video game consoles such as the [[Atari 2600]].

Aggressive pricing of the C64 is considered to be a major catalyst in the [[video game crash of 1983]]. In 1983, Commodore offered a $100 [[Rebate (marketing)|rebate]] in the United States on the purchase of a C64 upon receipt of any video game console or computer. To take advantage of the $100 rebate, some mail-order dealers and retailers offered a [[Timex Sinclair 1000]] for as little as $10 with purchase of a C64 so the consumer could send the computer to Commodore, collect the rebate, and pocket the difference.<ref name="doorstop">A contemporary rumor stated that while Commodore scavenged most trade-in computers for spare parts, its employees used the TS1000s as [[door stop]]s.</ref> [[Timex Corporation]] departed the marketplace within a year. The success of the VIC-20 and C64 also contributed significantly to the exit of [[Texas Instruments]]' [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A|TI-99/4A]] and other competitors from the field.

In 1984, Commodore released the [[Commodore Plus/4]]. The Plus/4 offered a higher-color display, a better implementation of [[Commodore BASIC|BASIC]] (V3.5), and built-in software. However, Commodore committed what was perceived by critics and consumers as a major strategic error by making it incompatible with the C64. To top it all off, the Plus/4 lacked hardware [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] capability and had much poorer sound, thus seriously underperforming in two of the areas that had made the C64 a star.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the primary competitors to the C64 were the British-built [[Sinclair Research Ltd|Sinclair]] [[ZX Spectrum]] and the [[Amstrad]] [[Amstrad CPC|CPC464]]. Released a few months ahead of the C64, and selling for almost half the price, the Spectrum quickly became the market leader. Commodore would have an uphill struggle against the Spectrum, it could no longer rely on undercutting the competition. The C64 debuted at <U+00A3>399 in early 1983, while the Spectrum cost <U+00A3>175. The C64 would later rival the Spectrum in popularity in the latter half of the 1980s, eventually outliving the Spectrum (which was discontinued in 1992).

Despite a few attempts by Commodore to discontinue the C64 in favour of other, higher priced machines, constant demand made its  
discontinuation a hard task. By 1988, Commodore were selling 1.5 million C64s worldwide. Although demand for the C64 dropped off in the US by 1990, it continued to be popular in the UK and other European countries. In the end, economics, not obsolescence sealed the C64's fate. In March 1994 at [[CeBIT]] in [[Hanover]] [[Germany]], Commodore announced that the C64 would be finally discontinued in 1995. Commodore claimed that the C64's [[Commodore 1541|disk drive]] was more expensive to manufacture than the C64 itself. Although Commodore had planned to discontinue the C64 by 1995, the company filed for bankruptcy a month later, in April 1994.

===The C64 family===
[[Image:Sx64.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Commodore SX-64 (1984).]]
1982: Commodore releases the [[Commodore MAX Machine]] in Japan. It is called the '''Ultimax''' in the US, and '''VC-10''' in Germany. The MAX was intended to be a game console with limited computing capability. It was discontinued months after its introduction, because of poor sales in Japan.

In 1984 Commodore released the [[Commodore SX-64|SX-64]], a portable version of the C64. The SX-64 has the distinction of being the first ''full-color'' portable computer. The base unit featured a 5 inch (127 mm) [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] and an integral [[Commodore 1541|1541]] floppy disk drive. 

{{clr}}[[Image:C64c_system.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Commodore 64C system with 1541-II floppy drive and 1084S RGB monitor (1986).]]

Commodore was determined to avoid the problems of the Plus/4, making sure that the eventual successors to the C64<U+2014>the [[Commodore 128]] and 128D computers (1985)<U+2014>were as good as, and fully compatible with the original, as well as offering a host of improvements (such as a structured BASIC with graphics and sound commands, 80-column display capability, and full CP/M compatibility).

In 1986, Commodore released the '''Commodore 64C''' ('''C64C''') computer, which was functionally identical to the original, but whose exterior design was remodelled in the sleeker style of the C128 and other contemporary design trends. In the [[U.S.]], the C64C was often bundled with the third-party [[GEOS (8-bit operating system)|GEOS]] [[graphical user interface|GUI]]-based operating system. The [[Commodore 1541]] disk drive was also remodelled resulting in the 1541-II.


{{clr}}[[Image:Commodore 64 GS.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Commodore C64 Games System]]

In 1990, the C64 was re-released in the form of a game console, called the [[Commodore 64 Games System|C64 Games System]] ('''C64GS'''). A simple modification to the C64C's motherboard was made to orient the cartridge connector to a vertical position. This allowed cartridges to be inserted from above. A modified ROM replaced the BASIC interpreter with a boot screen to inform the user to insert a cartridge. The C64GS was another commercial failure for Commodore, and it was never released outside of Europe. 

In 1990, an advanced successor to the C64, the [[Commodore 65]] (also known as the "C64DX"), was prototyped, but the project was cancelled by Commodore's chairman [[Irving Gould]] in 1991. The C65's specifications were very good for an 8-bit computer. For example, it could display 256 colours on screen, while [[Original Amiga chipset|OCS]] based Amigas could only display 64. Although no specific reason was given for the C65's cancellation, it seemed that it was a conflict of interest with lower end Amigas. The [[Amiga 600]] was released in mid 1992, eventually taking the C65's place as an advanced C64 upgrade.

===C64 clones===
In the summer of 2004, after an absence from the marketplace of more than 10 years, PC manufacturer [[Tulip Computers BV]] (owners of the Commodore brand since 1997) announced the [[C64 Direct-to-TV]] '''(C64DTV)''', a [[joystick]]-based [[TV game]] based on the C64 with 30 games built into ROM. Designed by [[Jeri Ellsworth]], a self-taught computer designer who had earlier designed the modern [[C-One]] C64 implementation, the C64DTV was similar in concept to other mini-consoles based on the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Intellivision]] which had gained modest success earlier in the decade. The product was advertised on [[QVC]] in the United States for the 2004 holiday season. Some users have installed [[Commodore 1541|1541]] floppy disk drives, hard drives, second joysticks and keyboards to these units, which give the DTV devices nearly all of the capabilities of a full Commodore 64. The DTV hardware is also used in the mini-console/game ''[[Hummer (video game)|Hummer]]'', sold at [[Radio Shack]] mid-2005.

[[As of 2006]], C64 enthusiasts still develop new hardware, including [[Ethernet]] cards, specially adapted [[hard disk]]s and [[Flash memory|Flash]] Card interfaces.

===An active demo scene===
At the time of its introduction, the C64's graphics and sound capabilities were rivalled only by the [[Atari 8-bit family]].  This was at a time when most IBM PCs and compatibles had text-only graphics cards, [[green screen]] monitors, and sound consisting of squeaks and beeps from the built-in tiny, low-quality [[loudspeaker|speaker]].

Due to its advanced graphics and sound, the C64 is  often credited with starting the computer subculture known as the [[demoscene]] (see [[Commodore 64 demos]]). The C64 lost its top position among demo coders when the [[16-bit]] [[Atari ST]] and [[Commodore Amiga]] were released in 1985, however it still remained a very popular platform for demo coding upto the early 90s.
 
By of the turn of the millennium, it is still being actively used as a demo machine, especially for music (its [[MOS Technology SID|sound chip]] even being used in special sound cards for PCs). Unfortunately, the differences between [[PAL]] and [[NTSC]] C64s caused compatibility problems between US/Canadian C64s and those from most other countries. The vast majority of demos run only on PAL machines.

==Hardware==
===Graphics and sound===
The C64 used an [[8-bit]] [[MOS Technology 6510]] [[microprocessor]] (a close derivative of the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] with an added 6-bit internal I/O port that in the C64 is used for two purposes: to bank-switch the machine's [[Read-only memory|ROM]] in and out of the processor's address space, and to operate the [[datasette]] tape recorder) and had 64 [[kilobyte]]s of [[random access memory|RAM]], of which 38 kB were available to built-in [[Commodore BASIC|Commodore BASIC 2.0]].

The graphics chip, [[MOS Technology VIC-II|VIC-II]], featured 16 colors, eight [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], [[scrolling]] capabilities, and two bitmap graphics modes. The standard text mode featured 40 columns, like most [[Commodore PET]] models; the built in [[font]] was not standard [[ASCII]] but [[PETSCII]], an extended form of [[ASCII-1963]]. [[Computer game|Computer]]/[[Computer and video games|video game]] and [[demoscene|demo]] programmers quickly learned how to exploit quirks in the VIC-II to gain additional capabilities, like making more than 8 sprites appear, and move, simultaneously.

The sound chip, [[MOS Technology SID|SID]], had three channels with several different [[waveform]]s, [[ring modulation]] and filter capabilities. It too, was very advanced for its time. It was designed by [[Bob Yannes]], who would later co-found synthesizer company [[Ensoniq]]. Yannes criticized other contemporary computer sound chips as "primitive, obviously (...) designed by people who knew nothing about music." Often the game music became a hit of its own among C64 users. Well-known composers and programmers of game music on the C64 were [[Rob Hubbard]], [[David Whittaker]], [[Ben Daglish]] and [[Martin Galway]], among many others. Due to the chip's limitation to three channels, chords were played as [[arpeggio]]s typically, coining the C64's characteristic lively sound.

There are two versions of the SID chip, the first version was the MOS Technology 6581, which is to be found in all of the original "breadbox" C64s, and early versions of the C64C and the [[Commodore 128]]. It was later replaced with the MOS Technology 8580 in 1987. The sound quailty was a little more crisp on the 6581 and many Commodore 64 fans still prefer its sound. The main difference between the 6581 and the 8580 was the voltage supply: the 6581 uses a 12 volt supply, while the 8580 required only 9 volts. A voltage modification can be made to use a 6581 in a C64C board (which uses 9V).

The SID chip has a distinctive sound which retained a following of devotees. In 1999, Swedish company [[Elektron (company)|Elektron]] produced a [[SidStation]] synth module, built around the SID chip, using remaining stocks of the chip. Several bands use these devices in their music.

===Hardware revisions===
Cost reduction was the driving force for hardware revisions to the C64's motherboard. Reducing manufacturing costs was vitally important to Commodore's survival during the price war and leaner years of the 16-bit era. The C64's original ([[NMOS]] based) motherboard would go through two major redesigns, (and numerous sub-revisions) exchanging positions of the VIC-II, SID and [[programmable logic array|PLA]] chips. Initially, a large proportion of the cost was lowered by reducing the number of discrete components used, such as diodes and resistors.

[[Image:C64motherboard.jpg|thumb|right|350px|An early C64 motherboard (Rev A [[PAL]] 1982).]]

[[Image:C64Cmotherboard.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A C64C motherboard ("C64E" Rev B PAL 1992).]]

The VIC-II was manufactured with 5 [[micrometre]] [[NMOS]] technology, clocked at 8&nbsp;MHz. At such a high clock rate, it generated a lot of heat, forcing MOS Technology to use a ceramic [[Dual in-line package|DIL package]] (called a "CERDIP"). The ceramic package was more expensive, but it dissipated heat more effectively than plastic.

After a redesign in 1983, the VIC-II was encased in a plastic DIL package, which reduced costs substantially, but it did not eliminate the heat problem. Without a ceramic package, the VIC-II required the use of a [[heatsink]]. To avoid extra cost, the metal [[radio frequency|RF]] [[electromagnetic shielding|shielding]] doubled as the heatsink for the VIC, although not all units shipped with this type of shielding. Most C64s in [[Europe]] shipped with a cardboard RF shield, coated with a layer of metal foil. The effectiveness of the cardboard was highly questionable, and worse still it acted as an insulator, blocking airflow which trapped heat generated by the SID, VIC and PLA chips.

The SID was manufactured using NMOS at 7 and in some areas 6 micrometres. The prototype SID and some very early production models featured a ceramic DIL package, but unlike the VIC-II, these are extremely rare as the SID was encased in plastic when production started in early 1982.

In 1986 Commodore released the last revision to the "classic" C64 motherboard. It was otherwise identical to the 1984 design, except that it now used two 64 kbit <U+00D7>4 [[DRAM]] chips rather than the original eight 64 kbit <U+00D7>1.

After the release of the C64C, MOS Technology began to reconfigure the C64's chipset to use [[HMOS]] technology. The main benefit of using HMOS was that it required less voltage to drive the IC, which consequently generates less heat. This enhanced the overall reliability of the SID and VIC-II. The new chipset was re-numbered to 85xx in order to reflect the change to HMOS.

In 1987 Commodore released C64Cs with a totally redesigned motherboard commonly known as a "short board". The new board used the new HMOS chipset, featuring new 64-pin PLA chip. The new "SuperPLA" as it was dubbed, integrated many discrete components and [[transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] chips. The 2114 color RAM was integrated into the last revision of the PLA.

===Power problems===
The C64 used an external [[power supply]]. While this saved valuable space within the computer's case, the supply itself was barely adequate for the C64's power requirements and occasionally failed from overheating. Some users purchased heavier-duty, better-cooled, third-party power supplies. Later in the Commodore's lifetime, third-party power supplies became increasingly important when used in conjunction with [[Creative Micro Designs]]' peripherals. Of particular note, a C64 coupled with a RAM expansion or CMD [[SuperCPU]] required more power than the original Commodore power supply could provide.

==C64 trivia==
*One out of three Commodore 64's during its launch were defective. Many of the early units had video problems causing a blurry effect that made alphanumeric characters difficult to read.
*On address <code>$FFF6-$FFF9 (65526-9)</code> in the C64 [[KERNAL]], right before the [[hardcoding|hard-coded]] jump vectors for the processor, you can find the letter sequence "RRBY". This is indeed the initials of Robert Russell and Bob Yannes, the two main engineers that created the C64.
*The Commodore 64's BASIC V2, the programming language which came built-in with the computer, can be crashed by executing <code>PRINT""+-[''x'']</code> (where ''x'' is any integer), or by attempting to create a BASIC program with an initial line number near <code>350800</code>.
*Due to a quirk in the C64's BASIC operating system, an [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]] or [[screensaver]] of sorts may be activated: Begin by pressing the <code><span style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; border-color:black; padding:1px 2px 1px 2px;">RUN/STOP</span></code> and <code><span style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px; border-color:black; padding:1px 2px 1px 2px;">RESTORE</span></code> keys in unison; then enter "<code>POKE781,96:SYS58251</code>" on the subsequently cleared screen.
