'''Michel Ynoa''' (born September 24, 1991, [[Dominican Republic]]) is a [[Dominican American|Dominican-American]] [[pitcher]] who is commonly known as "Michael Inoa."  Ynoa is  signed with the [[Oakland Athletics]] for the amount of 4.25 million dollars, settling a new record for the A's organization after lefty pitcher [[Mark Mulder]] was signed for 3.2 million in 1998. Ynoa was named the "Number One" and the "crown jewel" in the "Best Latino Prospects of 2008. "<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3433834 ESPN Website].  Accessed July 2, 2008.</ref> Ynoa is said to be the most impressive Latin American player prospect since [[Felix Hernandez]] in 2002. "<ref> http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3470209 . Accessed July 12, 2008. </ref>

He is only 18 years of age, he is 6 feet 7 inches, and weighs 210lbs (pounds), and two [[Major League Baseball]] teams ([[Cincinnati Reds]], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]) "reportedly offered Ynoa about $5 million."<ref>Jeff Passan, "Ynoa becomes a sign of the times," Yahoo! Sports, Exclusive, July 3, 2008, found at [http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=jp-inoa070308&prov=yhoo&type=lgns Yahoo Sports]. Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref> It was reported that Ynoa signed with Oakland not New York, who he had originally verbally agreed on a deal with, because of the better treatment of the Oakland staff, the management style of General Manager [[Billy Beane]], and the better pitcher development record in Oakland.{{fact|date=July 2008}}

After not pitching in 2009 due to injuries, Ynoa is slated to pitch in Arizona Rookie League for 2010.

==Spelling of name==
Michel Ynoa is the original spelling of Michael's name. His first name was anglicized to "Michael" after he signed with the [[Oakland Athletics]] in July 2008. <ref> http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/07/01/SPCF11I75S.DTL . Accessed March 10, 2009. </ref> Although Michael's last name is more commonly spelled with an "I," as of February 2009, he will be using the original spelling "Ynoa." "According to A's director of player development [[Keith Lieppman]], [Y]noa will start going by the original spelling of his last name, 'Ynoa.' Somewhere along the line, there was a mixup on the spelling, and the pitcher's name made its way into the public forum with an 'I.'"  <ref> http://www.insidebayarea.com/athletics/ci_11752474 .
