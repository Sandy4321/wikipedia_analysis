Richard Peddie is the President and CEO of Maple Leafs Sports and Entertainment.

Since taking over MLSE, he has tripled its value to over $1.5 billion.<ref>{{cite news | last = Vardi | first = Nathan | title = Winning Isn't Everything | url = http://members.forbes.com/forbes/2007/1126/096.html | publisher = Forbes | date = 2007-11-16 | accessdate = 2007-11-16}}</ref> As of 2008, the Toronto Maple Leafs, valued at $448 million, are the most valuable franchise in the [[National Hockey League]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/31/nhl08_NHL-Team-Valuations_Value.html | title = NHL Team Valuations | publisher = Forbes | date = 2008-10-30 | accessdate = 2008-10-30}}</ref>

In July, 2006, Peddie made an announcement that Leafs' ticket prices would be lower for the 2006-2007 season, due to the Conservative government's 1% tax cut to the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|GST]]. Peddie was criticized for his statement about MLSE executives that "[they're] not the money-grubbing characters [they're] often made out to be," especially because this "price-lowering" only cemented the sentiment.<ref>{{cite news |title= Are you sitting down? Leafs reduce ticket prices|publisher= ''[[Toronto Star]]'' |page= D03|date= 2006-07-05|accessdate=2007-11-05 }}</ref> The savings on each ticket ranged from $0.35 to $1.73. The lower prices were short lived, as they rose by 6% for the [[2007<U+2013>08 NHL season]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Starkman | first = Randy | title = Leafs boost ticket prices amid failure | url = http://www.thestar.com/article/210695 | publisher = ''Toronto Star'' | date = 2007-05-05 | accessdate = 2007-11-16}}</ref>

Richard Peddie is married to Colleen McAnoy. He is a graduate of the [[University of Windsor]] holding both Degree in Business Administration and an Honorary Doctor of Laws.

Peddie claims to have always dreamed of owning a professional basketball franchise, a dream that came true when the Toronto Raptors debuted in the 1995<U+2013>96 season.<ref>{{cite news | last = Ellis | first = Leigh | title = Steady Peddie Keeps Toronto Ticking | url = http://www.thegoodpoint.com/other/dec08/steady-peddie-keeps-toronto-ticking.html | publisher = The Good Point | date = 2008-12-05 | accessdate = 2008-12-24}}</ref>
