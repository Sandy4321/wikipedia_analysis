The '''Azalea class''' was a class of twelve minesweeping sloops built under the Emergency War Programme for the [[Royal Navy]] in [[World War I]] as part of the larger "Flower Class", which were also referred to as the "Cabbage Class", or "Herbaceous Borders". The third batch of twelve ships to be ordered, in May [[1915]], they differed from the preceding ''Acacia'' class only in mounting a heavier armament, with either 4.7in or 4in guns instead of the 12pdrs of the earlier class.

They were single-screw Fleet Sweeping Vessels (Sloops) with triple hulls at the bows to give extra protection against loss when working.
