==History==
[[File:The town of Vouvray.jpg|left|280px|thumb|Viticulture has existed around the village of Vouvray since at least the Middle Ages]]
[[Viticulture]] has existed in Vouvray since at least the [[Middle Ages]] when the [[Catholic Church]] maintained vineyards at the local [[monasteries]]. The Chenin blanc grape, known locally as ''Pineau de la Loire'', is believed to have originated in the [[Anjou wine]] region sometime in the 9th century and from there  eventually migrated to Vouvray. In the 16th and 17th century, [[Dutch (people)|Dutch]] merchants oversaw the plantings of many vineyards in the area to be used for wine trade with markets in [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[Rotterdam]]. Grapes from all over Touraine were brought together in a mass blending labeled simply as "Vouvray". Wine cellars were built in the region from caves created from the [[excavation]] of [[tuffeau]] rocks used to build the [[Ch<U+00E2>teaux of the Loire Valley]]. The cold, steady temperature of these cellars served ideal for the advancement of [[sparkling wines]] made according to the traditional ''[[m<U+00E9>thode champenoise]]'' that became popular in the 18th and 19th century. In 1936 Vouvray was created as an ''[[Appellation d'origine contr<U+00F4>l<U+00E9>e]]'' (AOC).<ref name="Oxford pg 759"/> The boundaries of the AOC were defined around the village of Vouvray and seven nearby villages.<ref name="Dummies pg 201-202"> E. McCarthy & M. Ewing-Mulligan ''"French Wine for Dummies"'' pg 201-202 Wiley Publishing 2001 ISBN 0764553542 </ref> Included among these villages were [[Chan<U+00E7>ay]], [[Nouzilly]], [[Vernou-sur-Brenne]] and [[Rochecorbon]].<ref name="Johnson atlas pg 121"> H.

==Climate and geography==
[[File:Vouvray Vineyard after budbreak.jpg|right|thumb|Vineyards in Vouvray are planted with a southerly aspect on a plateau.]]
Located along the right bank of the [[Loire river]] east of the city of Tours, the Vouvray region is situated on top a [[plateau]] that is dissected by small streams and [[tributaries of the Loire]] such as the [[Cisse (river)|Cisse]] and [[Brenne]].<ref name="Johnson atlas pg 121"/> These streams contribute to the unique climate conditions that promote the development of the ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]'' fungus that causes the noble rot used to produce sweet dessert style wines. The climate of the region is mostly [[continental (climate)|continental]] with some [[maritime (climate)|maritime]] influence from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] located more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) to the west. Wine production in the region is highly dependent on the climate with significant vintage variation expressed year due to the variable climate. Cooler climate years shift the bulk of production towards drier styles of wine including sparkling Vouvray. More warmer climate years promote the production of sweeter, dessert style wines.<ref name="Oxford pg 759"/>

The northern location and relatively cooler climate combines to make [[harvest (wine)|harvest]] in Vouvray one of the last to completed in France, often lasting into November. Vineyards are usually planted on the plateau above the river bank in soils composed of [[gravel]] and clay on top of [[tuffeau]].<ref name="Oxford pg 759"/>

==Viticulture and winemaking==
[[File:Vouvray wine cave.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Excavated caves carved into the tuffeau soils are often converted into wine cellars that offer consistent, cool temperatures ideal for sparkling wine production and aging wine.]]
Chenin blanc is the dominant and nearly exclusive grape of Vouvray.<ref name="Robinson pg 184"> J. Robinson ''Jancis Robinson's Wine Course'' Third Edition pg 184 Abbeville Press 2003 ISBN 0789208830 </ref> While the obscure minor grape [[Arbois (grape)|Arbois]] is permitted in the Vouvray AOC, it is rarely seen. With more 5,000 acres (2,000 hectares) of vineyards planted as of 2006, it is the single largest producer of Chenin blanc based wines in France by a sizable margin with only the [[Anjou wine]] region of the [[Coteaux du Layon]] coming close. Most of the vineyards are planted on a plateau with a southern aspect facing towards the river. Viticulture and [[wine production]] in the region is dictated almost completely by the climate characteristics of a particular vintage with cooler climate years shifting productions towards dry and sparkling wines while warmer vintages seeing increased production of sweet and even [[botrytized wine]]s. The [[harvest (wine)|harvest]] in Vouvray is often the last in France to be completed, potentially lasting till November. When sweet and botrytized wine are being produce, the harvest is often very labor intensive involve success ''tries'' or passages through the vineyards with harvesters hand picking only the ripest berries.<ref name="Oxford pg 759"/>

Yearly Vouvray produces more than a million cases of wine a year.<ref name="Dummies pg 201-202"/> The traditional style of [[winemaking]] in Vouvray is a [[minimalist]] approach, often using neutral [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] vessel such as stainless steel and not submitting the wine to [[malolactic fermentation]]. While some winemakers are experimenting with [[oak (wine)|oak]]<ref name="Johnson atlas pg 121"/>, very few wines are made with new oak. Vouvrays are usually bottled early and expected to age in the [[wine bottle]].<ref name="Oxford pg 759"/> Sparkling wines are made according to the [[traditional method]] and can either be ''[[p<U+00E9>tillant]]'' (semi-sparkling) or ''[[mousseux]]'' (fully sparkling).<ref name="Dummies pg 201-202"/>

==Wines and styles==
[[File:Chenin blanc grapes.jpg|right|thumb|Chenin blanc is the dominant grape of Vouvray.]]
The Chenin blanc wines of Vouvray are characterized by the grape's natural high [[acidity (wine)|acidity]]. The perception of that acidity and style of wine will be determined based on the balance of [[sugar (wine)|sugar]] in the wine. Dry or ''sec'' styles will have more noticeable acidity than the sweeter ''demi-sec'' and ''moelleux''. The acidity is also a key component to the wine's aging ability.<ref name="Oxford pg 759"/> Depending on the style, Vouvrays can exhibit notes of [[honey]], [[nuts (meat)|nuts]], [[ginger]], [[fig]], [[apples]] and white flowers. Vouvrays are often [[paired (wine)|paired]] with rich, hearty dishes and flavorful sauces.<ref name="MacNeil pg 269-271"/>

===Sweetness levels===
As Vouvray can be made in a wide range of sweetness styles, the [[wine label]]s may indicate the sweetness level by the terms ''Sec, Demi-Sec, Moelleux and Doux''. While these terms are not strictly defined, they tend to roughly fall into the guidelines below. Note that the [[residual sugar]] level may not equate to the level of sweetness that a taster will perceive in the wine due to balance of acidity in the wine. In some cases a producer's ''Demi-Sec'' wine may taste drier than their ''Sec''. Sparkling Vouvray may also have the sweetness level indicated on the label.<ref name="MacNeil pg 269-271"/>
*'''Sec''' The driest level with 0-0.4% (less than 4 grams per liter) residual sugar. Sometimes producers will specify their bone dry wines as ''Sec-Sec'' or "dry dry" and their slightly less dry wines as ''Sec-tendres'' or "gently dry".<ref name="MacNeil pg 269-271"/>
*'''Demi-Sec''' An "off dry" style with between 0.4-1.2% (4 to 12 grams per liter) of residual sugar.<ref name="MacNeil pg 269-271"/> 
*'''Moelleux''' A sweet, often botrytized style with 1.2-4.5% (12 to 45 grams per liter) of residual sugar. The term ''Moelleux'' is [[French (language)|French]] for "mellow".<ref name="MacNeil pg 269-271"/>
*'''Doux''' The sweetest style with more 4.5% (45 grams per liter) of residual sugar. The term ''liquoreux'' or "liquor-like" may appear on the label to describe the almost syrupy sweet nature.<ref name="MacNeil pg 269-271"/>

===Aging===
[[File:Sauternes noble rot grapes.jpg|left|thumb|In favorable vintages when the climate conditions encourages the development of noble rot ''(example pictured)'', the sweet wine styles of Vouvray will often have immense aging potential and longevity.]]
Vouvrays are known for their longevity and aging potential, particularly if the vintage was favorable. Some wines, most notably the sweeter ''Moelleux'' styles, have the potential to age and develop in the bottle for several decades to a century. While modern producers and [[global warming]] are contributing to making examples more approachable to drink while young, some premium examples still made in the traditionally high acid style will often need 3 to 7 years of bottle age before the acidity tones down.<ref name="MacNeil pg 269-271"/> Dry or ''Sec'' examples from favorable vintages can have the potential to age for 15-20 years or more but many are ready to drink within 4 or 5 years after vintage. Sparkling Vouvrays tend not to have the same aging potential as their still wine counterparts of vintage dated [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] and are usually meant to be consumed within 3 years of vintage or, for non-vintage bottling, soon after purchase.<ref name="Dummies pg 201-202"/>

In 2005 ''[[Decanter Magazine]]'' conducted a compilation of the "100 Greatest Wines" ever made. A 1947 Vouvray (considered a favorable year by many critics<ref name="Robinson pg 184"/>) from the producer [[S.A. Huet]] was ranked #6 on this listing-the second highest ranking for any white wine behind only the 1921 vintage of [[Chateau d'Yquem]].<ref>W.
