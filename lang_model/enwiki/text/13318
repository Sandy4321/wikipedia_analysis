A '''replicant''' is a bioengineered or [[Biorobotics|biorobotic]] being created in the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982). The Nexus series&mdash;genetically designed by the [[Blade Runner#Tyrell Corporation|Tyrell Corporation]]&mdash;are virtually identical to an adult human, but have superior strength, agility, and variable intelligence depending on the model. Because of their physical similarity to humans, a replicant must be detected by its lack of emotional responses and empathy to questions posed in a [[Voight-Kampff machine|Voight-Kampff]] test. A derogatory term for a replicant is "skin-job." (Note: This term reappears in the reimagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' in derogatory reference to [[Humanoid Cylons]] - who could also be considered as a type of replicants.)

==Origin==
[[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' which inspired ''[[Blade Runner]]'' used the term [[android (robot)|android]] (andy), but director [[Ridley Scott]] wanted a new term that did not have preconceptions. As [[David Peoples]] was rewriting the screenplay he consulted his daughter who was involved in microbiology and biochemistry. She suggested the term "replicating" which is the process of duplicating cells for cloning. From that, one of them (both would later recall it was the other) came up with ''replicant'' and it was inserted into [[Hampton Fancher]]'s screenplay.<ref>Interview with David Proples in ''Sacrificial Sheep: The Novel vs. the Film''.

==Replicants in the film==

[[File:BladeRunner Rachael.jpg|right|340px|thumb|Rachael, a replicant.]]

Replicants became illegal on Earth after a bloody mutiny by Nexus-6s off-world. The Tyrell Corp. discovered that the longer a Nexus-6 lived the more life-experience it gained. With these memories they often developed their own emotional reflexes, and the longer they lived the more independent and unstable their personalities became.  So, Tyrell added a "fail-safe device" to Nexus-6 models: a built-in four-year lifespan to prevent them from developing their own "emotional responses." This was especially necessary for Mental-A models whose intellectual capacity at least matched those of their genetic designers.  

However, Tyrell later tells Roy that the preset life-span is inherently dependent on Nexus-6 biology.  Noting that "the candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long", Tyrell explains that Nexus-6 replicants do not live longer not due to some sort of kill switch, but because they physically ''cannot'' - the result of superhuman capabilities engineered into them to make full use of the four-year time limit.  Roy suggests several means of extending his lifespan (demonstrating that he possesses at least equal knowledge to that of his creator about his physical construction), but Tyrell reveals that he already tried each of these suggestions, failing in every attempt. 

Special police units (Blade Runners) are sent to investigate, test and ultimately "retire" (kill) replicants found on Earth. Because the escaped replicants are the latest Nexus-6 generation Deckard had no experience with them, and wasn't even sure if the [[Voight-Kampff machine|Voight-Kampff]] test would work.

Escaped replicants (all Nexus-6 Physical-A models):
* Roy Batty (''played by [[Rutger Hauer]]'') is a self-sufficient combat model for the colonization defence program. (Mental-A)
* Pris (''played by [[Darryl Hannah]]'') is a prostitute referred to as a "[[Brothel|basic pleasure]]" model for military personnel. (Mental-B)
* Zhora (''played by [[Joanna Cassidy]]'') was retrained for political homicide, operating in a "kick murder squad." (Mental-B)
* Leon (''played by [[Brion James]]'') is a combat model or loader for nuclear fission. (Mental-C)
* Hodge was killed in an electrical field at the Tyrell Corporation.
* Mary, the '''6th replicant'''. Actress ''[[Stacey Nelkin]]'' was cast in the part of Mary but the character was cut from the film early on in principal photography due to budget constraints. This created a plot hole and speculation among fans as to whether Deckard was the 6th replicant with new memories. However, in the 2007 Final Cut, Captain Bryant's dialog was altered, so he now mentions two Replicants killed by the electric field, rather than just one as in the 1982 U.S. theatrical version. In the original workprint version, Bryant also mentions two Replicants killed.

Pris and Zhora's descriptions were mixed up (perhaps on purpose) in the film:  Zhora acts as a "basic pleasure model", attempting to pass off as a stripper, while Pris (who is dressed like a [[prostitute]]) is capable of acrobatic combat moves which nearly kill Deckard.  

Other replicants:
* Rachael (''played by [[Sean Young]]'') is a prototype Nexus-6 (possibly a more advanced model, i.e. Nexus-7) with implanted memories from Eldon Tyrell's niece.

Tyrell developed Rachael as an experimental replicant with false memory implants, so she would think she was human. Tyrell said that these memories would act as a "pillow" to cushion her developing emotions.  As a result, Rachael behaved far more "human" than any previous replicant.  Normal replicants aren't very empathetic or "human" in character, and are emotionally unstable, because over 4 years, they develop the same experiences humans develop over decades.  Thus, Leon who is only two years old is somewhat immature; while four year old Roy Batty who is feeling the effects of his impending death shows a range of emotions. Roy appears capable of love, guilt, sorrow, and empathy (although these emotions confuse him to a degree).  According to Deckard, a normal replicant can usually be discovered using the Voight-Kampff test after being given about 20-30 questions, cross-referenced.  However, Rachel answered over 100 questions before Deckard realized she was a replicant.  In particular, the question that finally outed her involved a reaction to people "eating raw oyster and broiled dog": it is implied that Rachel simply didn't have enough life-experience to know that this wasn't considered socially permissible.  

The theatrical cut's voiceover ending said that as an experimental replicant Rachael didn't have the pre-determined four-year lifespan, but the Director's Cut left that ambiguous.  

In ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' the Rosen Corporation simply did not know how to manufacture an android capable of living longer than four years.

==Was Deckard a replicant?==
{{main|Themes in Blade Runner#Deckard: replicant or human.3F|l1='''Themes in Blade Runner'''}}
''Blade Runner'''s dark paranoid atmosphere &ndash; and multiple versions of the film &ndash; adds fuel to the speculation and debate over this issue.

In the [[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?|book]], Rick Deckard (the main character) is at one point tricked into following an android, who believes himself to be a police officer, to a faked police station. Deckard then escapes and "retires" some androids there before returning to his own police station. However, Deckard takes the Voigt-Kampff (different spelling) test and it fails to indicate that he is an android.

[[Harrison Ford]], who played Deckard in the film, has said that he did not think Deckard was a replicant, and also states he and the director had discussions that ended in the agreement that the character was human. However, according to several interviews with director Ridley Scott, Deckard is indeed a replicant.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/825641.stm|title=Blade Runner riddle solved|publisher=BBC News|date=2000-07-09|accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref> He collects photographs, seen crowding over his piano, yet has no obvious family, beyond a reference to his ex-wife (who called him ''cold fish''). It can be argued that the scene in which he talks with Rachael, their eyes both shine in the way indicative of Replicants.{{Or|date=October 2010}}

Furthermore in the Director's Cut police officer Gaff (played by [[Edward James Olmos]]) leaves Rick Deckard an origami Unicorn a day after Rick dreamed of one. Just before Deckard finds the unicorn, Gaff says to him in passing, "It's too bad she [Rachael] won't live...then again, who does?". A unicorn can also be seen briefly in a scene in J. F. Sebastian's home, amongst scattered toys (to the right of a sleeping Sebastian, while Pris snoops around his equipment).  Unicorns also appear several times in the dream sequences of the director's cut, and as it is explained in the film; every memory and dream{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} a replicant has is known to the creator, e.g. the memory Rachel has of the spiders.{{Or|date=October 2010}}

That Gaff is leaving origami unicorns at Deckard's house, implies that Gaff is aware of the content of Deckard's unicorn dream.

The dream may not be uniquely Deckard's, as the unicorn does appear in J.F. Sebastian house.  As J.F. designed the "brain" of the Nexus-6 (and other) replicants, one could take the opinion that the unicorn dreams are a "personal touch" added to some or all Nexus-6 (and above) "brains."  Since we are not privy to the dreams of the other replicants, this is unknown - however it does add weight to the argument. From this one could also spectulate that Gaff himself is a replicant and may share in the same imbedded memory.{{Or|date=October 2010}}

Paul Sammon, author of ''Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner'', has suggested in interviews that Deckard may be a Nexus-7, a next-generation replicant who possesses no superhuman strength or intelligence, but brain implants that complete the human illusion. This view is shared by Ridley Scott.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/mpd/permalink/m30VR9HY1NX2UI:m1LD3BEJD2T5Z9|title=Blade Runner Interview with Ridley Scott and Sean Young}}</ref> Sammon also suggests that Nexus-7 replicants may not have a preset lifespan (i.e., they could be immortal).  If so, this may suggest that Rachael is also a Nexus-7.<ref>Sammon, Paul (2002) [http://brmovie.com/Articles/Sammon_Interview_17.htm BRmovie.com <U+2014> Interview with Paul M. Sammon], sections 13 and 17</ref>

==Organic or Machine?==
Although the [[press kit]] released to the media for the film explicitly defined a replicant as, "A [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] creature composed entirely of [[organic material|organic]] substance",<ref>[http://www.brmovie.com/FAQs/BR_FAQ_Terminology.htm BRmovie.com: BR FAQ: Blade Runner Terminology<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> a question commonly posed is the physical make-up of the replicants themselves. In the opening crawl of the film, replicants are said to be the result of "advanced robot [[evolution]]." The crawl also states that they were created by "genetic engineers." Characters mention that they have eyes and brains like humans, and they are seen to bleed when injured (although they can take a lot more damage than humans can). The film explicitly shows that at least their eyes are created and stored separately, so there must be some "assembly" required. An alternative explanation could be that they are [[cyborg]]s, having both human and machine parts.

The original [[novel]] makes mention of the biological components of the androids, but also alludes to the mechanical aspects commonly found in other material relating to robots.

Due to the film's ambiguous stance to the question, it has been suggested by fans{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} that Ridley Scott chose to keep the question unanswered in an attempt to preserve the film and novel's core theme: what is human?
