}}'''Giovanni Caboto''' (known in English as '''John Cabot'''; c. 1450 <U+2013> c. 1499) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[navigator]] and [[exploration|explorer]] whose 1497 discovery of [[North America]] is commonly held to be the second European voyage to the continent since [[Christopher Columbus]] a few years earlier. The official position of the Canadian and United Kingdom governments is that he landed on the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].

==Name and origins==

Cabot's birthplace and name are both controversial. In Italy he is known today as Giovanni Caboto, in Spain as Juan Caboto and in England as John Cabot. The Spanish and English forms are not wrong as such, they merely reflect the way contemporary 15th-century documents described him. As for the way he described himself, only one set of documents has been found bearing his signature. These are Venetian testamentary documents of 1484, on which he signed himself as "Zuan Chabotto", ''Zuan'' being a form of ''John'' typical to [[Venice]].<ref>Edoardo Giuffrida, "New documents on Giovanni Caboto" in R. Mamoli Zorzi (ed.), ''Attraversare gli Oceani: Da Giovanni Caboto al Canada Multiculturale'' (Venice, 1999), 61. Juliana de Luna, [http://www.s-gabriel.org/names/juliana/16thcvenice.html Names from Sixteenth Century Venice] (2008).</ref> That he continued to use this form in England, at least among Italians, is supported by two letters written from London in 1497. One, from a London-based Venetian, gives Cabot's first name as ''Zuam''.<ref>[http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1497pasqualigo.htm Lorenzo Pasqualigo to his brothers at Venice, 23 August 1497]</ref> Another, from the Milanese Ambassador, spells his name ''Zoane''.<ref name="soncino">[http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1497soncino.htm Raimondo de Raimondi de Soncino, Milanese Ambassador in England, to Ludvico Maria Sforza, Duke of Milan, 18 December 1497]</ref> On the other hand, in a document identified in October 2010, he is described by his Italian banker in London as 'Giovanni Chabbote', this being the only known ''contemporary'' document to use this version of his first name.<ref>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/history/research/cabot.html 'Cabot Project'</ref>

[[Gaeta]] (in the [[Province of Latina]]) and [[Castiglione Chiavarese]] (in the [[Province of Genoa]]) have both been proposed as birthplaces.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.gianfrancobernabei.it/pdf/caboto.pdf |title=SCHEDA TECNICA DOCUMENTARIO <U+201C>CABOTO<U+201D>: I CABOTO E IL NUOVO MONDO |language=Italian |format=PDF}} (''TECHNICAL DOCUMENTARY "CABOTO": I and Catalan origins have been proved to be without foundation.{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=101|title = CABOT |publisher = Canadian Biography | accessdate = 2008-05-17 | last= |quote=}}</ref> The main evidence for Gaeta is that there are records of a Caboto family dwelling there until the mid-15th century but ceasing to be traceable after 1443.<ref>Roberto Almagi<U+00E1>, ''Commemorazione di Sebastiano Caboto nel IV centenario della morte'' (Venezia, 1958), pp. 37-8.</ref> On the other hand, Pedro de Ayala, Cabot's contemporary in London, described him in 1498 as "another Genoese like Columbus".<ref name="bris.ac.uk">[http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1498ayala.htm Pedro de Ayala, the Spanish envoy in London, to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella in Spain, 25 July, 1498]</ref> John Cabot's son, [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian]], also appears to have believed that his father originally came  from [[Genoa]]. What is certain is that in 1476 Cabot was made a Venetian citizen, which required a minimum of fifteen years residency in the city. He must therefore have lived in Venice since at least 1461.<ref>J.A. Williamson, ''The Cabot Voyages and Bristol Discovery Under Henry VII'' (Hakluyt Society, Second Series, No. 120, CUP, 1962), pp. 33-4</ref>

==Life until 1496==
John Cabot first appears in the Venetian records in 1470 when he was accepted into the religious [[confraternity]] of [[St John the Evangelist]]. Since this was one of the city's great confraternities, this suggests that he was already a respected member of the community at this stage. This may suggest that he was born slightly earlier than 1450, which is the approximate date most commonly given for his birth.

Following Cabot's acquisition of full Venetian citizenship in 1476, he would have become eligible to engage in maritime trade, including the trade to the eastern Mediterranean, which was the source of much of Venice's wealth. He presumably became engaged in this trade shortly thereafter and is mentioned in a document of 1483 selling a slave in [[Crete]] that he had acquired while in the territories of the Sultan of Egypt, which then comprised most of what is now [[Palestine]], [[Syria]] and the [[Lebannon]].<ref>Giuffrida, "New documents on Giovanni Caboto" pp. 62-3</ref> By itself, this does not prove Cabot's later assertion that he had visited [[Mecca]], made in 1497 to the Milanese ambassador in London.<ref name="soncino"/> It does, however, suggest that he would have had much better knowledge of the origins of the oriental merchandise he would have been dealing in (such as spices and silks) than most Europeans at that time.

"Zuan Cabotto" (i.e. John Cabot) is mentioned in a variety of Venetian records of the 1480s. These indicate that by 1484 he was married to Mattea and already had at least two sons.<ref>Williamson, ''The Cabot Voyages'', pp. 93, 192-95</ref> Cabot's sons are named in his 1496 royal patent as Ludovico, [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian]], and Sancto.<ref>http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1496cabotpatent.htm First Letters Patent granted by Henry VII to John Cabot, 5 March 1496</ref> The Venetian sources also contain references to Cabot being involved in house building during his time there. This may be how he acquired the experience that later allowed him to promote himself as a civil engineer in Spain.<ref>Giuffrida, "New documents on Giovanni Caboto" pp. 69</ref>

Cabot appears to have got into financial trouble in the late 1480s and had left Venice as an insolvent debtor by 5 November 1488. He moved to [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] where his creditors attempted to have him arrested by sending a ''lettere di raccomandazione a giustizia'' ("a letter of recommendation to justice") to the authorities.<ref>M. F. Tiepolo, "Documenti Veneziani su Giovanni Caboto", ''Studi Veneziani'', xv (1973), pp. 585<U+2013>97</ref> While in Valencia, "John Cabot Montecalunya" (as he is referred to in local documents) proposed plans for improvements to the harbour. These proposals were rejected, however.<ref>M. Balesteros-Gaibrois,   "Juan Caboto en Espa<U+00F1>a: nueva luz sobre un problema viejo", ''Revista de Indias'', iv (1943), 607<U+2013>27</ref> Early in 1494 he moved on to [[Seville]], where he proposed, was contracted to build and, for five months, worked on the construction of a stone bridge over the [[Guadalquivir]] river. This project was abandoned following a decision of the City Council on 24 December 1494.<ref>[http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1494cabotseville.htm John Cabot in Seville, 1494]</ref> After this Cabot appears to have sought support for an Atlantic expedition in Seville and [[Lisbon]], before moving on to England.<ref name="bris.ac.uk"/> It therefore seems likely that he would have arrived in England around the middle of 1495.

==Sponsorship==
Like other Italian explorers, including [[Christopher Columbus]], Cabot was commissioned by another country, and in Cabot's case it was England. Once [[Henry the Navigator]] began searching for a route around Africa, the Iberian peninsula (Portugal and Spain) began to attract Italian navigational talent, especially after [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s discovery of "the Indies" (as all Asia was called at the time) by sailing west. After that voyage, a number of explorers headed in that direction; Cabot had a simple plan, to start from a northerly latitude where the longitudes are much closer together, and where, as a result, the voyage would be much shorter.<ref name="virginia">{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/journals/EH/EH33/croxto33.html|title = The Cabot Dilemma:John Cabot's 1497 Voyage &the Limits of Historiography|publisher = [[University of Virginia]]| accessdate = 2008-05-17 | last= Derek Croxton|quote=}}</ref>

Historians have generally assumed that, on arrival in England, Cabot went straight to Bristol to seek backers.<ref>[http://ehr.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/CXXI/492/778 "The Matthew of Bristol and the financiers of John Cabot's 1497 voyage to North America", ''English Historical Review'' (2006)]</ref>  This seemed logical, given that his expeditions did, indeed, set out from this port and it was the only English city to have had a prior history of undertaking exploration expeditions out into the Atlantic. Moreover, since Cabot's royal patent (1496), stated that all expeditions should be undertaken from Bristol, it seemed that his primary supporters were likely to have come from that city. Yet, while Bristol may have seemed like the logical place for Cabot to go to seek funding, Dr [[Alwyn Ruddock]] claimed to have found evidence that Cabot actually went first to London and received backing from the Italian community there. In particular, she suggested he found a patron in the form of [[Fr. Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis]], an [[Augustinian friar]] who was also the deputy to the papal tax collector [[Adriano Castellesi]]. Ruddock suggested that it was Carbonariis, who certainly accompanied Cabot's 1498 expedition and who was on good terms with the King, who introduced the explorer to Henry VII. Beyond this, Ruddock claimed that Cabot received a loan from an Italian banking house in London 'to go and discover new lands'.  Determining the basis of Ruddock's claims is difficult, since she ordered the destruction of all her research notes on her death in 2005.<ref>Evan T. Jones, [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119408885/HTMLSTART Alwyn Ruddock: John Cabot and the Discovery of America], ''Historical Research'' Vol 81, Issue 212 (2008), pp. 231-34.</ref> However, since that time, researchers on what has now become [http://www.bristol.ac.uk/history/research/cabot.html The Cabot Project] , have been engaged in a hunt to relocate her evidence. On the matter of Cabot's sponsorship, Dr Evan Jones ([[University of Bristol]]) reported to the Canadian press in October 2010 that Dr Francesco Guidi Bruscoli ([[University of Florence]]), had now found the ledger which contains the loan made to Cabot in 1496.<ref>[http://www.theprovince.com/news/3700925/story.html 'Italian bank backed Cabot voyage to Newfoundland, new research reveals'], ''The Province, Montreal Gazette, Times Colonist, Ottawa Citizen, Vancouver Sun, Calgary Herald'' et. al., 20 Oct. 2010.</ref> The sum involved was significant, albeit not enough to have completely financed even a single expedition.

On 5 March 1496 King [[Henry VII of England]] gave Cabot [[letters patent]] with the following charge:
{{bquote|...free authority, faculty and power to sail to all parts, regions and coasts of the eastern, western and northern sea, under our banners, flags and ensigns, with five ships or vessels of whatsoever burden and quality they may be, and with so many and with such mariners and men as they may wish to take with them in the said ships, at their own proper costs and charges, to find, discover and investigate whatsoever islands, countries, regions or provinces of heathens and infidels, in whatsoever part of the world placed, which before this time were unknown to all Christians.<ref>[http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1496cabotpatent.htm First Letters Patent granted by Henry VII to John Cabot, 5 March 1496]</ref>}}

[[File:NLE Bonavista5 tango7174.jpg|thumb|Monument at [[Cape Bonavista]], Newfoundland.]]

Cabot went to Bristol to make the preparations for his voyage. [[Bristol]] was the second-largest seaport in England, and during the years from 1480 onwards several expeditions had been sent out to look for [[Brazil (mythical island)|Hy-Brazil]], an island said to lie somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean according to [[Celts|Celtic]] legends.<ref>Williamson, ''The Cabot Voyages'', pp. 187-9</ref> Bristol may have been particularly interested in seeking this island because it appears to have been believed that Bristol men had discovered the island at earlier date but then lost it. Since it was said to be a source of [[brazilwood]] (from which a valuable red dye could be obtained) the merchants had a sound economic motive for seeking the isle.<ref>[http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1476brasil.htm Salazar's account of Bristol's discovery of the Island of Brasil (pre 1476)]</ref>

===First voyage===
All that is known about Cabot's first voyage is contained in a letter from John Day (a Bristol merchant) to Christopher Columbus. The letter, written in the winter of 1497/8, mostly concerns the 1497 voyage. However, by way of an aside, Day notes that: "Since your Lordship wants information relating to the first voyage, here is what happened: he went with one ship, his crew confused him, he was short of supplies and ran into bad weather, and he decided to turn back.".<ref>http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1497johnday.htm John Day letter to the Lord Grand Admiral, Winter 1497/8</ref> Since Cabot only received his patent in March 1496, it is generally assumed that this voyage took place in the summer of that year

===Second voyage===
Nearly everything that is known about the 1497 voyage comes from four short letters and a brief [[chronicle]] entry. The chronicle entry, which dates from 1565, states in its entry for 1496/7 that "This year, on St. John the Baptist's Day [24 June 1497], the land of America was found by the Merchants of Bristow in a shippe of Bristowe, called the Mathew; the which said the ship departed from the port of Bristowe, the second day of May, and came home again the 6th of August next following."<ref>[http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1565fust.htm Fust Manuscript: The Chronicle of Maurice Toby, 1565]</ref> Although the source is late, some of the details can be corroborated from sources that the Bristol chronicler cannot have known about. It is thus generally considered that he had copied the main details from some earlier chronicle entry, perhaps merely replacing "new found land", or something similar, with "America", which had become a common term by 1565. Given that various of the details in the chronicle can be corroborated, it is generally assumed to be reliable.

[[File:Newfoundland Cabots ship 1897 issue-10d.jpg|thumb|<center>''~ The Matthew ~''</center> In 1897, on the 400th anniversary of Cabot's discovery on North America, the Newfoundland Post Office issued a commemorative stamp honoring Cabot and his discovery.]]

If the 1565 chronicle is helpful when it comes to the key dates and the name of the ship, the four letters add more colour. The first is a letter from a Venetian merchant on 23 August 1497.<ref>[http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1497pasqualigo.htm 'Lorenzo Pasqualigo to his brothers at Venice, 23 August 1497]</ref> The letter has a slightly gossipy air to it, written by a man who may or may not have talked to Cabot directly.

The author of the second letter is unknown, but would appear from the general content to be from a diplomatic source. It was written on 24 August, apparently to the Duke of Milan.<ref>[http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1497milanletter.htm News sent from London to the Duke of Milan, 24 August 1497]</ref> Cabot's voyage is only mentioned very briefly.

The third letter is from Raimondo de Raimondi de Soncino, Milanese ambassador in London to the Duke of Milan on 18 December.<ref name="soncino"/> It is more serious in tone than Pasqualigo's and is clearly based on conversations the ambassador had with both Cabot, whom the writer claims to have "made friends with" and his Bristol compatriots, who are said to be the "leading men in this enterprise...and great seamen".

The fourth letter is the "John Day letter", which was written during the winter of 1497/8 by a Bristol merchant, John Day (alias Hugh Say of London) to a man who can almost certainly be identified as [[Christopher Columbus]].<ref>[http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1497johnday.htm John Day letter to the Lord Grand Admiral, Winter 1497/8]</ref> The letter is useful in that it is written by a man who would presumably have had access to all the key players and had assembled all the detail of the voyage that he could. Columbus was presumably interested in the voyage because, if the lands Cabot had discovered lay west of the  meridian laid down in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], or if the Venetian intended to sail further west, then the English voyages would have represented a direct challenge to the monopoly rights Columbus possessed for westwards exploration.

In addition to these letters, Dr [[Alwyn Ruddock]] claimed to have found another, written on 10 August 1497 by the London-based bankers of [[Fr. Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis]]. This letter has yet to be found, since the archive in which Ruddock located it is unknown. From various comments made by Ruddock it seems, however, that the letter did not contain a detailed account of the voyage.<ref>[http://hdl.handle.net/1983/1274	On the basis of a letter sent by Ruddock to Quinn on 1 May 1992, it appeared for a time that the bank involved was Venetian: E.T. Jones, 'The Quinn papers: transcripts of correspondence relating to the Bristol discovery voyages to North America in the fifteenth century', p. 16.]. However, discoveries made by Condon and Jones in August 2010 now suggest that this was not the case.</ref> On the other hand, she did claim that it contained "new evidence supporting the claim that seamen of Bristol had already discovered land across the ocean before John Cabot's arrival in England."<ref>Evan T. Jones, [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119408885/HTMLSTART Alwyn Ruddock: John Cabot and the Discovery of America], pp. 237-40.</ref> This would make the letter a valuable find. On the other hand, even if the letter does demonstrate that the bankers ''believed'' that Cabot had merely re-discovered a land previously found by men from Bristol, this does not necessarily mean that this belief was correct.

As is often the case, the known sources do not agree with each other on all aspects of the events and none can be assumed to be entirely reliable. Nevertheless, drawing the main points, they suggest that Cabot had only one "little ship",<ref name="soncino"/> of 50 tons burden,<ref name="john day">John Day letter</ref> called the ''[[Matthew (ship)|Matthew]] of Bristol'' (according to the 1565 chronicle). It was said to be laden with sufficient supplies for "seven or eight months".<ref name="john day"/>  The ship departed in May (the sources do not agree on the precise date), with a crew of either eighteen men according to Soncino<ref name="soncino"/> or twenty, according to the John Day letter.<ref name="john day"/> The crew included Cabot, an unnamed Burgundian and a Genoese barber,<ref name="soncino"/> who had presumably accompanied the expedition as the ship's surgeon, rather than as a hairdresser. There were also Bristol companions who were of sufficient status to join Cabot at court in London,<ref name="soncino"/> which suggests that at least two Bristol merchants had accompanied the expedition. One of these was probably [[William Weston (explorer)|William Weston]], given that he received a reward from the King in January 1498 and Weston is known to have undertaken an independent voyage to the New Found Land, probably under Cabot's patent, in 1499. The typical working crew for a fifty-ton vessel in this period would have been about ten men, although it might have been deemed wise to take a few extra mariners on such a long voyage.

Leaving Bristol, the expedition sailed past Ireland and across the Atlantic making landfall somewhere on the coast of North America on June 24, 1497. The exact location of the landfall has long been a matter of great controversy, with different communities vying for the status of being the location of the landing. At various times historians have proposed [[Bonavista, Newfoundland|Bonavista]], [[St. John's, Newfoundland|St. John's]] in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], [[Cape Breton Island]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Labrador]], and [[Maine]] as possibilities. [[Cape Bonavista]] in Newfoundland, however, is the location recognised by the governments of Canada and the United Kingdom as being Cabot's "official" landing place. As such, it was chosen, for instance, as the place where Queen Elizabeth II along with members of the Italian and Canadian governments greeted the replica ''Matthew'' of Bristol, following its celebratory crossing of the Atlantic in 1997.<ref>[[Republic of Venice|Lion of Saint Mark]], gifted from [[Regione Veneto]] to the city of [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], for the 500th year from the arrival of John Cabot: http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Halifay_-_NS_-_Giovanni_Caboto_Gedenktafel.jpg&filetimestamp=20081107221453</ref> Wherever Cabot landed, it is, at any rate, generally supposed that they were the first Europeans to set foot in North American since the [[Vikings]], whose voyages half a millennium earlier were probably unknown to the Bristol explorers.

Cabot is only reported to have landed once during the expedition and did not advance "beyond the shooting distance of a crossbow".<ref name="john day"/> Both Paqualigo and Day agree that no contact was made with any native people, but they found the remains of a fire, a human trail, nets and a wooden tool. The crew only appeared to have remained on land long enough to take on fresh water and to raise the Venetian and Papal banners and claim the land for the King of England.<ref>P D'Epiro, M.D. Pinkowish, "Sprezzatura: 50 ways Italian genius shaped the world" pp. 179-180</ref> By so doing they claimed the land in the name of England, while recognising the religious authority of the Roman Catholic Church.  After this landing, Cabot spent some weeks "discovering the coast".<ref name="john day"/> Day's letter suggests that "most of the land was discovered after turning back", which suggests the landfall was some way to the west / south of the most easterly point of North America.  Both Day's letter and that of Soncino comment on the vast multitude of codfish in the sea, Soncino reporting that "the sea there is swarming with fish, which can be taken not only with the net, but in baskets let down with a stone, so that it sinks in the water."<ref name="soncino"/>  John Day's letter states that the expedition left the New World once they reached a cape said to lie "1800 miles west of [[Dursey Island|Dursey Head]], which is in Ireland".<ref name="john day"/> Given that the latitude of Dursey Head is 51<U+00B0> 35' N, this implies that, wherever Cabot made landfall, his departure point was at the northern tip of the [[Great Northern Peninsula]] of Newfoundland (51<U+00B0> 36' N). On the homeward voyage Cabot's crew incorrectly thought they were going too far north, so they took a more southerly course, reaching [[Brittany]] instead of England. On August 6 the expedition returned to Bristol.

===Final voyage===

Back in England, Cabot appears to have ridden directly to see the King.  On 10 August, he was given a reward of <U+00A3>10 <U+2014> equivalent to about two years' pay for an ordinary labourer or craftsman.<ref>Williamson, ''The Cabot Voyages'', p. 214</ref> The explorer was initially feted, Soncino commenting on 23 August that Cabot "is called the Great Admiral and vast honour is paid to him and he goes dressed in silk, and these English run after him like mad".<ref name="soncino"/> Such adulation was short-lived, however, for over the next few months the King's attention was occupied entirely by the [[Second Cornish Uprising of 1497]], led by [[Perkin Warbeck]]. Nevertheless, once Henry's throne was secure he gave some more thought to Cabot. In December 1497 the explorer was awarded a pension of <U+00A3>20 per year and in February 1498 he was given an additional patent to help him prepare a second expedition.<ref>Williamson, ''The Cabot Voyages'', pp. 217-19, 226-7</ref> In March and April the King also advanced a number of loans to Lancelot Thirkill of London, Thomas Bradley and John Cair, who were all to accompany Cabot's new expedition.<ref>Williamson, ''The Cabot Voyages'', pp. 214-15</ref>
The ''Great Chronicle of London'' reports that Cabot departed with a fleet of five ships from Bristol at the beginning of May, one of which had been prepared by the King. Some of the ships were said to be carrying merchandise, including cloth, caps, lace points and other "trifles".<ref>Williamson, ''The Cabot Voyages'', pp. 220-23</ref> This implies that they hoped to engage in trade. The Spanish envoy in London reported in July that one of the ships had been caught in a storm and been forced to land in Ireland, but the other ships had kept on their way.<ref name="bris.ac.uk"/>

Nothing more has been found (or at least published) that relates to this expedition and it has often been assumed from this that Cabot's fleet was lost at sea. On the other hand, it has long been known that at least one of the men who had been scheduled to accompany the expedition, Lancelot Thirkill of London, is recorded as living in London in 1501.<ref>Williamson, ''The Cabot Voyages'', pp. 92-4</ref> More recently it has been revealed that [[Alwyn Ruddock]] apparently found evidence to suggest that Cabot and his expedition returned to England in the Spring of 1500. She claimed that this followed an epic two-year exploration of the east coast of North America, which took Cabot and his compatriots right down into the Spanish territories in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, she suggested that a religious colony was established in Newfoundland by [[Fr. Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis]] and the other friars who accompanied the 1498 expedition. That Carbonariis had accompanied the expedition has long been known and his missionary intent can be inferred from a rather disparaging reference to him, by the Spanish Ambassador in London, as being "another Friar Buil", this being a reference to [[Bernardo Buil]], who accompanied Columbus on his 1493 expedition and celebrated the first mass in the Americas. On the other hand, if Ruddock's belief that Carbonariis did establish a settlement in North America is correct, this would certainly be the first Christian settlement on the continent, complete with the first (and only) medieval church to be built there. It appears this church may have been named after [[San Giovanni a Carbonara]] in Naples, which was the mother church of the "Carbonara", a group of reformed Augustinian friars.<ref>Evan T. Jones, [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119408885/HTMLSTART Alwyn Ruddock: John Cabot and the Discovery of America], pp. 242-9.</ref>  A search to find the evidence on which these claims rested is now being undertaken by [http://www.bristol.ac.uk/history/research/cabot.html The Cabot Project] at the [[University of Bristol]]. The lead researchers on the project, Dr Evan Jones and Margaret Condon claim to have found further evidence to support aspects of Ruddock's case, particularly in relation to the return of the 1498 expedition, with documents having been located that appear to place John Cabot back in London by May 1500. The evidence for this has, however, yet to be published.

[[Alwyn Ruddock]] also claimed that [[William Weston (Early English Navigator)|William Weston]] of Bristol, a supporter of Cabot, undertook an independent expedition to North America in 1499, sailing north from Newfoundland up to the [[Hudson Strait]].<ref>Evan T. Jones, [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119408885/HTMLSTART Alwyn Ruddock: John Cabot and the Discovery of America], pp. 245-9.</ref> If correct, this was probably the first [[North West Passage]] expedition. That William Weston (who was not previously known to have been involved in the expeditions) did lead an expedition to the "new found land" in 1499 has now been confirmed.<ref>Evan T. Jones, [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/122579649/HTMLSTART Henry VII and the Bristol expeditions to North America: the Condon documents], ''Historical Research'', 27 Aug 2009</ref>

==Sebastian's voyage==
John's son, [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], later made at least one voyage to North America, looking for the hoped for [[Northwest Passage]] (1508), as well as another to repeat [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]'s voyage around the world, but which instead ended up looking for [[silver]] along the [[R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]] (1525-8).

*[[Cabot Tower (Newfoundland)|Cabot Tower]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland]], constructed in 1897 to commemorate the four-hundredth anniversary of Cabot's voyage.
*[[Cabot Tower (Bristol)|Cabot Tower]], in [[Bristol]], [[England]]. This is a 30-metre tall red sandstone tower begun in 1897 to mark the 400th anniversary of the landing. It is located on [[Parks of Bristol|Brandon Hill]] near the [[Bristol city centre|city centre]] and was begun as a fraternal response to the earlier decision of Newfoundland to construct their tower.
*The Giovanni Caboto Club, an Italian club located in Windsor, Ontario, established in 1925.<ref>[http://www.cabotoclub.com/history.html Giovanni Caboto Club History]</ref>
*A 1952 statue of the explorer at the entrance to [[Council House, Bristol|Bristol's Council House]] <U+2014> albeit one that the city council decided in 1956 to designate as a "symbolic figure of an Elizabethan seaman". This was despite the fact that the sculptor [[Charles Wheeler (sculptor)|Charles Wheeler]] exhibited the work in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition of 1952 as "Number 1423, John Cabot <U+2014> sketch model for the statue on the New Council House, Bristol". In addition, it may be noted that the figure is dressed in fifteenth-century clothing, has a fifteenth-century navigational instrument (astrolabe) hanging from his belt and is clutching what is clearly meant to be John Cabot's [[letters patent]]. Despite all this, the Council still "maintains that the statue does ''not'' represent the city's renowned explorer, John Cabot."<ref>Douglas Merritt, ''Sculpture in Bristol'' (Bristol, 2002), p. 90</ref> The reason for the Council's "re-designation" of the statue is not recorded, but may be related to its decision to name the new council house after Elizabeth II, who opened the building in April 1956.<ref>[http://www.flickr.com/photos/bolou/3743246797/ Photograph: Statue of John Cabot / Elizabethan Seaman]</ref>
*[[John Cabot University]] is an American university established in 1972 in [[Rome]], [[Italy]].

*[[Cabot, Bristol|Cabot Ward]] is an electoral district in Bristol, albeit one that gets its name from [[Cabot Tower (Bristol)|Cabot Tower]], which lies in the ward, rather than directly from the explorer.
