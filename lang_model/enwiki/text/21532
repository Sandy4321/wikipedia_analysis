Lying between [[Lake Michigan]] to the east and [[Chicago Loop|the Loop]] to the west, [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] has been Chicago's front yard since the mid-19th century. Its northwest corner, north of Monroe Street and the [[Art Institute of Chicago|Art Institute]], east of [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]], south of Randolph Street, and west of Columbus Drive, had been [[Illinois Central Railroad|Illinois Central]] rail yards and parking lots until 1997, when it was made available for development by the city as [[Millennium Park]].<ref name=MPNYT>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/books/chapters/0806-1st-gilf.html|title=Millennium Park|accessdate=2008-06-24|date=2006-08-06|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Gilfoyle, Timothy J.}}</ref>  According to 2007 data released in 2008, Millennium Park trailed only [[Navy Pier]] as a Chicago tourist attraction.<ref>{{cite news|title=Crain's List Lartgest Tourist Attractions (Sightseeing): Ranked by 2007 attendance|date=2008-06-23|page=22|publisher=[[Crain Communications Inc]]|work=Crain's Chicago Business}}</ref>

The Millennium Park bicycle center was designed by David Steele of the architectural firm Muller & Muller,<ref name=BS/> which won a $120,000 contract to design the station by [[Memorial Day]] 2004,<ref name=Bdpmtcier/> and commenced the design in August 2003.<ref name=PMPBS/> This was at a time when bike stations were in place or being planned in several U.S. cities, such as [[Denver]], and, in [[California]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]. Developed at the time of "Bike 2010 Plan" discussions, the station was part of Mayor Daley's vision of Chicago as the most bicycle-friendly city in the United States. From the outset the plan was to have separate operators for the Cycle Center's rental and repair services, as well as its coffee and juice bar.<ref name=Bdpmtcier/>
