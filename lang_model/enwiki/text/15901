The '''Delaware River''' is a major river on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of the [[United States]].
A Dutch expedition led by [[Henry Hudson]] in 1609 first mapped the river.  The river was christened the ''South River'' in the [[New Netherland]] colony that followed, in contrast to the ''North River'', as the Hudson River was then known.  The name Delaware, for Sir Thomas West, Baron De La Warr, was used by the English and became standard following the English conquest of [[New Netherland]] in 1664.

The river meets tide-water at [[Trenton, New Jersey]]. Its total length, from the head of the longest branch to [[Cape May]] and [[Cape Henlopen]], is 410&nbsp;miles (660&nbsp;km), and above the head of the [[Delaware Bay]]. Its length is 360&nbsp;miles (579&nbsp;km).  The mean freshwater discharge of the Delaware River into the estuary is 11,550&nbsp;cubic feet (330&nbsp;m<U+00B3>) per second.

The Delaware River constitutes, in part, the boundary between [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New York]], the entire boundary between [[New Jersey]] and Pennsylvania, and most of the boundary between [[Delaware]] and New Jersey.  The Delaware-New Jersey Border is actually at the eastern-most river shoreline within the [[Twelve-Mile Circle|Twelve-Mile Circle of New Castle]], rather than the usual mid river or mid channel borders, causing small portions of the New Jersey peninsula falling west of the shoreline to fall under the jurisdiction of Delaware.  The rest of the borders follow a mid-channel approach.

Commerce was once important on the upper river, primarily prior to railway competition (1857).
* The [[Pennsylvania Canal (Delaware Division)|Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal]], running parallel with the river from Easton to Bristol, opened in 1830.
* The [[Delaware and Raritan Canal]], which runs along the New Jersey side of the Delaware River from [[Milford, New Jersey|Milford]] to [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], unites the waters of the Delaware and [[Raritan River|Raritan rivers]] as it empties the waters of the Delaware River via the canal outlet in  [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]].  This canal water conduit is still used as a water supply source by the State of [[New Jersey]].
* The [[Morris Canal]] (now abandoned and almost completely filled in) and the [[Delaware and Hudson Canal]] connected the Delaware and [[Hudson River|Hudson rivers]].
* The [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]] joins the waters of the Delaware with those of the [[Chesapeake Bay]].

The mean tides below [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] are about {{convert|6|ft|m}}. The magnitude of the commerce of Philadelphia has made the improvements of the river below that port of great importance. Small improvements were attempted by [[Pennsylvania]] as early as 1771.

In the "project of 1885" the United States government undertook systematically the formation of a {{convert|26|ft|adj=on}} channel {{convert|600|ft}} wide from Philadelphia to deep water in [[Delaware Bay]].  The River and Harbor Act of 1899 provided for a {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} channel 600&nbsp;feet wide from Philadelphia to the deep water of the bay.

==Course==
The main, [[West Branch Delaware River|west or Mohawk branch]] rises in [[Schoharie County, New York]], about {{convert|1886|ft}} above the sea, near [[Mount Jefferson (New York)|Mount Jefferson]], and flows tortuously through the plateau in a deep trough, impounded at one point to create the [[Cannonsville Reservoir]], and then becoming the state boundary of N.Y and Pennsylvania  at the [[42nd parallel north|42nd parallel]], until it emerges from the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]]. Similarly, the [[East Branch Delaware River|East Branch]] begins from a small pond south of [[Grand Gorge, New York|Grand Gorge]] in the [[Town (New York)|town]] of [[Roxbury, New York|Roxbury]] in [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware County]], flowing southward toward its impoundment by New York City to create the [[Pepacton Reservoir]], the largest reservoir in the [[New York City water supply system]]. The [[Confluence (geography)|confluence]] is just south of [[Hancock (village), New York|Hancock]].

[[Image:Middle Delaware River above Walpack Bend.jpg|thumb|upright|Delaware above Walpack Bend, where it leaves the [[buried valley]] eroded from [[Marcellus Formation|Marcellus Shale]] [[bedrock]]]]
From Handcock,  NY the river flows between the Pocono mountains and the lowered shale beds north of the Catskills.   The river flows down a broad [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] valley, passing [[Hawk's Nest, New York|Hawk's Nest overlook]] on the "Upper Delaware Scenic Byway". At Port Jervis it enters the Port Jervis trough. Below [[Port Jervis, New York]], the Walpack Ridge deflects the Delaware into the Minisink Valley, where it follows the southwest [[Strike and dip|strike]] of the eroded [[Marcellus Formation]] [[bed (geology)|beds]] along the Pennsylvania<U+2013>New Jersey state line for {{convert|25|mi|km}} to the end of the ridge at Walpack Bend in the [[Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area]].<ref name=White>{{cite web |url=http://www.njgeology.org/enviroed/newsletter/v2n1.pdf |title= Karst in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area |author=White, Ron W.; Monteverde, Donald H.|format= pdf|work= Unearthing New Jersey Vol. 2, No. 1 | date=02-01-2006 |accessdate=06-07-2008|publisher=New Jersey Geological Survey}}</ref><ref name=White1882>{{cite book

The Minisink is a [[buried valley]] where the Delaware flows in a bed of [[glacier|glacial]] [[till]] that buried the eroded bedrock during the [[last glacial period]]. It then skirts the [[Kittatinny Mountains|Kittatinny ridge]], which it crosses at the [[Delaware Water Gap]], between nearly vertical walls of [[sandstone]], [[quartzite]], and [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] and then passes through a quiet and charming country of farm and forest, diversified with plateaus and escarpments, until it crosses the Appalachian plain and enters the hills again at [[Easton, Pennsylvania]]. From this point it is flanked at intervals by fine hills, and in places by cliffs, of which the finest are the Nockamixon Rocks, {{convert|3|mi|0}} long and above {{convert|200|ft}} high.

At Trenton there is a fall of {{convert|8|ft}}. Below Trenton the river flows between [[Philadelphia]] and [[New Jersey]] before becoming a broad, sluggish inlet of the sea, with many marshes along its side, widening steadily into its great estuary, Delaware Bay.

===Tributaries===
The main [[tributary|tributaries]] in New York are the [[Mongaup River|Mongaup]],  [[Neversink River|Neversink rivers]] and [[Callicoon Creek]]. From Pennsylvania, the [[Lackawaxen River|Lackawaxen]], [[Lehigh River|Lehigh]], and [[Schuylkill River|Schuylkill rivers]]. From New Jersey, the Big Flatbrook, the Pequest, [[Rancocas Creek]], the [[Musconetcong River|Musconetcong]],  [[Maurice River|Maurice rivers]].  [[Oldmans Creek|Oldmans]] and [[Raccoon Creek (New Jersey)|Raccoon]], flow into the Delaware.

==Flooding==
The Delaware has experienced a number of serious flooding events as the result of snow melt and/or rain run-off from heavy rainstorms.  Record flooding occurred in August 1955, in the aftermath of the passing of the remnants of two separate hurricanes over the area within less than a week: first [[Hurricane Connie]] and then [[Hurricane Diane]], which was, and still is, the wettest tropical cyclone to have hit the northeastern United States.  The river gauge at Riegelsville, PA recorded an all time record crest of {{convert|38.85|ft}} on August 19, 1955.

More recently, moderate to severe flooding has occurred along the river. The same gauge at Riegelsville recorded a peak of {{convert|30.95|ft}} on September 23, 2004, {{convert|34.07|ft}} on April 4, 2005, and {{convert|33.62|ft}} on June 28, 2006, all considerably higher than the flood stage of {{convert|22|ft}}.<ref>[http://nj.usgs.gov/special/flood0606/ USGS]
See Also: [http://www.state.nj.us/drbc/Flood_Website/events.htm (State of New Jersey: Recent flooding events in the Delaware river basin]</ref>

Since the upper Delaware basin has few population centers along its banks, flooding in this area mainly affects natural unpopulated flood plains.  Residents in the middle part of the Delaware basin experience flooding, including three major floods in the three years (2004<U+2013>2006) that have severely damaged their homes and land. The lower part of the Delaware basin from Philadelphia southward to the Delaware Bay is tidal and much wider than portions further north, and is not prone to river related flooding (although tidal surges can cause minor flooding in this area).

The [[Delaware River Basin Commission]], along with local governments, is working to try to address the issue of flooding along the river. As the past few years have seen a rise in catastrophic floods, most residents of the river basin feel that something must be done. The local governments have worked in association with FEMA to address many of these problems, however, due to insufficient federal funds, progress is slow.<ref>Delaware River Basin Commission (2005-07-20). [http://www.state.nj.us/drbc/Flood_Website/10ptsJuly2005.pdf "Delaware River Basin Commission<U+2019>s Role in Flood Loss Reduction Efforts."] West Trenton, NJ.</ref>

==New York City Water Supply==
After [[New York City]] had made 15 reservoirs to supply water to the city's growing population, the city tried to gain permission to make five reservoirs along the Delaware River's tributaries. However, they were denied the permission to impound the Delaware's tributaries to make new reservoirs. So in 1928, New York City decided to draw water from the Delaware River to feed the population boom that had started during the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. However, villages and towns across the river in [[Pennsylvania]] were already using the Delaware for their water supply. The two sides eventually took their case to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], and in 1931, New York City was finally allowed to draw 440&nbsp;million gallons of water a day from the Delaware and its upstream tributaries.

==Crossings==
[[File:Washington Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Leutze, MMA-NYC, 1851.jpg|thumb|[[George Washington]] crossing the Delaware River prior to the [[Battle of Trenton]]]]
{{Main|List of crossings of the Delaware River}}
The Delaware River is a major barrier to travel between [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. Most of the larger bridges are tolled only westbound, and are owned by the [[Delaware River and Bay Authority]], [[Delaware River Port Authority]], [[Burlington County Bridge Commission]] or [[Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission]].

===Washington's crossing of the Delaware===
{{Main|Washington's crossing of the Delaware}}
Perhaps the most famous <U+201C>Delaware Crossing<U+201D> involved the improvised boat crossing undertaken by [[George Washington]]<U+2019>s army during the [[American Revolution]] on [[Christmas Day]], 1776.  This led to a successful surprise attack on the [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian troops]] occupying [[Trenton, New Jersey]].
