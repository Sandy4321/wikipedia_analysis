'''USS Shelikof (AVP-52)''' was a [[Barnegat class seaplane tender|''Barnegat''-class]] small [[seaplane tender]] commissioned by the [[U.S. Navy]] for use in [[World War II]]. ''Shelikof'' tended to [[seaplanes]], and served in the volatile [[Pacific War]] in combat areas that provided her three [[battle stars]] by war<U+2019>s end. 

''Shelikof'' (AVP-52) was laid down on [[20 September]] [[1942]] by the [[Lake Washington Shipyard]], [[Houghton, Washington]]; launched on [[31 January]] [[1943]], sponsored by Mrs. F. D. Wagner, and commissioned on [[17 April]] [[1944]], Lt. Comdr. R. E. Stanley in command.

== World War II Pacific Theatre operations ==

Upon completion of fitting out, ''Shelikof'' departed for [[Alameda, California]], on [[8 May]] and loaded aircraft spares. She then moved to [[San Diego, California]], for a [[Shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] in the bay area; to [[San Pedro, California]], for a yard period, and on [[30 June]], she departed for [[Pearl Harbor]] and the Pacific war zone. Nine days later, she was underway from [[Pearl Harbor]] with a convoy bound for [[Eniwetok]]. 

== Building a base on Saipan ==

While at [[Eniwetok]] from [[18 July]] to [[1 August]], the tender had her aviation machine shop and carpenter shop converted into combination aircraft and aircraft [[radar]] maintenance facilities. Her next port of call was [[Tanapag Harbor]], [[Saipan]] a former Japanese seaplane base. ''Shelikof's'' personnel went ashore daily to clear debris from the hangars and the surrounding area in order to make the base operable, thereby relieving the congestion at aircraft tenders. When the ship departed on [[3 December]] [[1944]], Naval Air Base, [[Saipan]], was being used as a supply depot and a major overhaul facility. 

== Supporting the Okinawa invasion ==

''Shelikof'' spent the next three months shuttling spare parts and supplies between [[Guam]], [[Ulithi]], and [[Saipan]]. She sailed from Saipan with [[Task Unit]] (TU) 51.20 on [[23 March]] [[1945]] for the invasion of the [[Ryukyu Islands]]. The seaplane group moved into the anchorage at [[Kerama Retto]] five days later as [[U.S. Army]] units were still battling to secure those small rocky islands before the major assault on [[Okinawa]] Jima began. ''Shelikof'' laid eight seaplane mooring buoys that day and three of them were put into use the following day when the first [[PBM Mariner|PBM-5's]] arrived. The anchorage was under constant enemy air attack during the month of April, but the only casualties aboard her occurred on the 28th when friendly fire wounded two men. On [[6 May]], the tender took an enemy plane under fire which approached within 1,000 yards, 50 feet off the water, but no damage to it was noted. 

== End-of-war activity ==

The seaplane base was shifted to [[Chimu Wan]], [[Okinawa]], on [[15 July]] and ''Shelikof'' operated there until the end of hostilities with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. She then shuttled between Okinawa and ports in Japan until departing for the [[United States]] on [[25 October]]. En route the tender made port at [[Midway Island]], [[Pearl Harbor]], San Diego, [[Acapulco]], and [[Coco Solo]] before arriving at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], on [[4 December]] [[1945]]. After an overhaul, she sailed on [[12 March]] [[1946]] for the [[Azores]]. Back in Norfolk on the 30th, ''Shelikof'' made four voyages to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] and two to [[Trinidad]] by [[11 June]]. Three days later, she was at [[Coco Solo]], and the ship operated from there until [[16 March]] [[1947]] when she sailed to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], for inactivation. 

== Post-war decommissioning ==

''Shelikof'' was decommissioned on [[30 June]] and placed in the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]] until [[1 May]] [[1960]] when she was struck from the [[Navy list]]. The tender was sold on [[20 December]] [[1960]] to Panagiotis Kokkinos, [[Pireaus]], [[Greece]], converted for merchant service as a passenger vessel, and renamed [[MV Myconos|MV ''Myconos'']] in 1964, [[MV Artemis|MV ''Artemis'']] in 1973, [[MV Artemis K|MV ''Artemis K'']] in 1974, and [[MV Golden Princess|MV ''Golden Princess'']] in [[1979]].  Final Disposition: she was sunk in a storm at [[Perama]], [[Greece]], while laid up in January [[1981]].

== Military honors and awards ==

''Shelikof'' earned three [[battle stars]] for [[World War II]] service.
