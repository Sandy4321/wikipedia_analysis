'''Ukrainians in Russia''' is the largest single [[Ukrainian diaspora]] of the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian people]]. In the [[Russian Federation]] they constitute 2% of the population, and make the third largest ethnic group after [[Russians]] and [[Tatars]].

==Ukrainian political borders with Russia and their formation==

The first [[Russian Empire Census]], conducted in 1897, showed extensive usage (and in some cases dominance) of the [[Little Russia]]n, a contemporary term of the [[Ukrainian language]],<ref> 1897 Census on Demoscope.ru [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97.php Retrieved] on 20th May 2007.</ref> in the nine south-western Governorates and the [[Kuban]]. Thus, when the [[Central Rada]] officials were outlining the future borders of the new Ukrainian state they took the results of the census in regards to the language and religion as determining factors. The ethnographic borders of Ukraine thus turned out to be almost twice as large as the original [[Cossack Hetmanate]] incorporated into Russia in the 17th century.<ref>[[Stanislav Kulchitsky]], "Imperia i my", Vol. 9, 26 Jan. 2006. [http://www.day.kiev.ua/156240/ Retrieved] on 19 March 2007.</ref>

Certain mixed regions were intermixed, in particularly this included the territory of [[Sloboda Ukraine|Sloboda]] and the [[Donbass]] industrial section. In this case the officials decided to evenly split them between Ukraine and Russia. After the Communist Victory in the [[Russian Civil War]], the UNR borders were preserved by the newly formed [[Ukrainian SSR]]. This left a strong mixed community on the Russian side of the border.

In the course of the mid-1920s in the course of adminatrative division, resulted in the Ukrainian SSR ceding some territory to the Russian SFSR, such as the [[Taganrog]] and [[Shakhty]] cities in the eastern Donbass, and gaining several regions that presently make up the [[Sumy Oblast]] in Sloboda region.

According to [[Volodymyr Kubiyovych]] and [[Aleksandr Zhukovsky]] the area of Ukrainian ethnic territory outside of the borders of the Ukrainian SSR (1970) where an ethnic Ukrainian majority lived was estimated to be 146,500 square kilometres and the area of nationally mixed territories take up approximately 747,600 square kilometres.

According to unpublished documents from the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs under the category of nationality 86 million people noted down Ukrainian ethnicity in 1989.<ref>(Lanovyk p. 8)</ref>

The [[Ukrainian diaspora]] today is divided into two major groups: [[Eastern Ukrainian Diaspora|Eastern]] and [[Western Ukrainian Diaspora|Western]]. The Eastern diaspora includes Ukrainian living in the former USSR and the Western diaspora includes all countries outside of the former [[USSR]]. The term Eastern Diaspora was first introduced in 1992. The estimated of the number of Ukrainians living in the Eastern diaspora are 6.8 million and the Western diaspora 5 million. Demographers however estimate up to 20 million Ukrainians living outside of Ukraine with 10 million living in the Eastern diaspora.{{fact|date=September 2007}}

According to the [[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Russian Census]], there are 2,942,961 Ukrainians in Russia (2% of the total population).

===Ukrainian life in the eastern diaspora===

During the Soviet times. The cultural separation from Ukraine proper meant that many were to form the so called "multicultural soviet nation". In Siberia, 82% of Ukrainian entered mixed marriages, primarily with Russians. This meant that outside the parent national republic there was little or no provision for continuing a diaspora function. Thus only in large cities such as Moscow would [[Ukrainian literature|Ukrainian press]] could be found. At the same time other Ukrainian cultural heritage such as clothing and national foods were preserved. According to Soviet sociologist, 27% of the Ukrainians in Siberia read Ukrainian printed material and 38% used the Ukrainian language. From time to time, Ukrainian groups would visit Siberia. Nonetheless most of the Ukrainians did assimilate.

===Statistics and scholarship===

Statistical information about Ukrainians in the Eastern diaspora from census materials of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union were collected in 1897, 1910, 1917, 1920, 1923, 1926, 1937, 1939, 1959, 1970, 1979, 1989 and 2002. Some allege that the statistics are inaccurate and claim that Ukrainian population has being understated. The results of the 1939 census is known to have been falsified.

In an attempt to unite the Ukrainians in the Eastern Diaspora in 1991 the journal "Zoloti Vorota" began to be published by the [[Society for relations with Ukrainians outside of Ukraine]], as also the magazine "Ukrainan diaspora." A series entitled the [[Encyclopedia of the Ukrainian Diaspora]] has also been appearing.

==14th-17th century migration==
==17th-18th century migration==
==In the 19th century==

Beggining with the 19th century, there was a continuous migration from the traditional European lands of Belarus, Ukraine and Northern Russia to settle the distant areas of the Empire, which promised free fertile land, a crucial factor for peasents who were under extensive [[social class|class]] pressure, and until [[1861]], lived under [[Serfdom]]. 

In the colonization of the new lands, a significant contribution was made by people from [[Little Russia]] Initially Ukrainians were used to colonise border territories, especially in the [[Caucasus]]. Most of these settlers came from [[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Slobozhanshchyna]] and mainly settled in [[Kuban]], [[Stavropol]], and [[Terek]] areas. Some compact areas of the [[Don]], [[Volga]] and [[Urals]] were also settled.

The Ukrainians created large settlements within Russia often becoming the majority population in certain centres. They continued fostering their traditions, their language and their architecture. Their village structure and administration differed somewhat from the Russian population that surrounded them.{{fact|date=September 2007}} Where populations were mixed, russification often took place.{{fact|date=September 2007}}

The size and geographical settlement of the Ukrainian population was first seen in the course of the [[Russian Empire Census|Russian Empire Census of 1897]]. Although the census only noted language, not ethnicity, and this affected mixed dialects. Nonetheless a total of 22,380,551 Ukrainian speakers were noted. On what is considered Ukrainian ethnic territory 20,160,000 (90.1%), 670,000 (3%) on mixed ethnic territory, and 1,560,000 (6.9%) in the eastern diaspora. Within the European territories of Russia lived 1,020,000, in Asia (without the Caucases) 209,000. From 1897-1914 the intense migration of Ukrainians to the Urals and Asia continued and, was measured to be 1.5 million before coming to a standstill in 1915.

==In the 20th century==
==Ukrainian cultural rennaissance in post-Soviet Russia==

The Ukrainian cultural rennaissance in Russia began in the last years of the 1980's. In Moscow the formation of the [[Slavutych Society]], in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] (now Saint Petersburg) the formation of the [[Ukrainian Cutural Centre named after T. Shevchenko]].

In 1991 the [[Ukraina Society]] organized a conference in [[Kiev]] with delegates from the various new Ukrainian Community oraganizations from the Eastern Diaspora. By 1991 over 20 such organizations were in existence. By 1992 600 organizations were registered in Russia alone. The Congress helped to consolidate the efforts of these organizations. From 1992 regional congresses began to take place organized by the Ukrainian organizations of Prymoria, [[Tyumen Oblast]], Siberia and the Far East. In March 1992 the [[Union of Ukrainian organizations in Moscow]] was founded. In May of that year - The [[Union of Ukrainians in Russia]].

The greatest problems with these community organizations is the lack of official financial sponsorship of their cultural endeavours.

===Zeleny Klyn===

[[Zeleny Klyn]] is often referred to as ''Zelena Ukraina''. This is an area of land settled by [[Ukrainians]] which is a part of the Far Eastern [[Siberia]] located on the [[Amur River]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It was named by the Ukrainian settlers. The territory consists of over 1,000,000 square kilometres and has a population of 3.1 million (1958).
The Ukrainian population in 1926 made up 41%-47% of the population.

===Moscow===

The [[Moscow State University]] was founded in 1755 and from its inception there were many students from Ukraine. Many had commenced their studies at the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]].

In the first years after the revolution of 1905 Moscow was one of the major centres of the Ukrainian movement for self awareness. The magazine Zoria was edited by [[A. Krymsky]] and from 1912-7 the Ukrainian cultural and literary magazine "Ukrainskaya zhyzn'" was also published there edited by [[Symon Petliura]]. Books in the Ukrainian language were published in Moscow from 1912 and Ukrainian theatrical troups of [[M. Kropovnytsky]] and [[M. Sadovsky]] were constantly performing there.
