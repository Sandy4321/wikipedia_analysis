'''Richard C. "Dick" Nolan'''<ref name=Emporia/> was an [[American football]] coach in the United States.  He was one of the early adopters of a heavier schedule than his peer schools, playing 12 games a year.  He would later use football as a physical fitness tool to develop physical fitness in the [[United States Navy]].

==Playing history==
===High school and Junior College===
A native of [[Picher, Oklahoma]], Nolan played [[Guard (American football)|guard]] and also served as captain of the Picher Gorillas football team in 1929.<ref name=bcd>{{cite news|title=Coaching Post To Picher Boy: R.C. 'Dick' Nolan Appointed To Pilot Teams of Southwestern at Winfield, Kas.|publisher=Miami (Okla.) Daily News-Record|date=1940-03-26}}</ref>  After graduating from Picher High School, Nolan was an all-state junior college football player at [[Rogers State University|Oklahoma Military Academy]].<ref name=Emporia>{{cite news|title=Nolan Starts Grid Work at Winfield|publisher=The Emporia Gazette|date=1940-04-05}}</ref><ref name=bcd/>

===Emporia State===
After completing his studies at the junior college level, Nolan attended [[Emporia State University|Emporia Teachers College]] and was named to the All-Kansas football team while playing for that school's program under head coach [[Fran Welch]].  Nolan also received a master's degree from Emporia Teachers College.<ref name=bcd/>

==Coaching history==
===Arkansas City Junior College===
Nolan was the head football coach at [[Cowley County Community College|Arkansas City Junior College]] in [[Arkansas City, Kansas]] from 1935-1939.<ref name=bcd/>  While at Arkansas City Junior City College, Nolan's teams were undefeated at home for four years.<ref name=bcd/>  The school has since disbanded its football program.

===Southwestern College===
In 1940, Nolan was hired by the [[Southwestern College Moundbuilders]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zmReAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IWENAAAAIBAJ&pg=4592,3123476&dq=dick-nolan+southwestern&hl=en|accessdate=January 11, 2011|publisher=[[Lawrence Journal-World]]|date=September 18, 1941|title=College Football Onto Sport Stage}}</ref> as the school's [[athletic director]] head football coach.  One newspaper noted that Nolan had his work cut out for him at Southwestern: "Football, however, been on the slide at Winfield since 1934 and Nolan faces a difficult problem of bringing the boys back into the money."<ref name=bcd/>  Another Kansas newspaper in March 1940 wrote:<blockquote>"Nolan knows football.  Better than that, Nolan knows football players.  It is reported that he drove through Frontenac, where every boy is either a potential all state guard or fullback, with an empty car. He left the town, bound for Arkansas City, with players jammed in the seats and standing on the running board."<ref>{{cite news|author=Freddy Mendell|title=From the Press Box|publisher=The Hutchinson, Kansas News-Herald|date=1940-03-24}}</ref></blockquote>
During Nolan's first year with the Moundbuilders, interest in football grew, as one Kansas newspaper reported: "Football interest continues rampant here. The largest opening crowd in many years saw the Builders play Alva last week."<ref name=abc>{{cite news|title=Builders Ready to Meet C. of E.|publisher=Emporia Gazette|date=1940-10-02}}</ref>  

Nolan was a supporter of a heavier schedule than most schools at the time, choosing to play twelve games in the 1941 regular season when most schools would only play eight.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kXQMAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jmUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=823,712856&dq=football+southwestern-college Madison Lake Times] "Sports Shorts" October 9, 1941</ref>  It was not until 2005 that schools would widely pursue twelve games in a regular season.<ref>{{cite web | title=Div.
