'''Ian David Craig''' (born [[June 12]] [[1935]] in [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]], [[New South Wales]]) is a former [[Australia]]n [[Test cricket]]er who represented [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] in 11 Tests between 1953 and 1958. A slightly built right-handed [[batting (cricket)|batsman]], Craig holds the record for being the youngest Australian to make a [[first-class cricket|first-class]] double [[century (cricket)|century]], gain Test selection and [[captain (cricket)|captain]] his country. Burdened by the public expectation of being the "next [[don Bradman|Bradman]]", Craig's career did not fulfil its early promise. In 1957, he was appointed captain of a young team as part of a regeneration plan following the decline of the national team in the mid-1950s, but a loss of form and illness forced him out of the team after one season. Craig made a comeback, but work commitments forced him to retire from first-class cricket at only 26&nbsp;years of age.

A teenage prodigy, Craig made his first-class debut for [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] in the last match of the 1951&ndash;52 Australian season, aged only 16. The following summer, Craig earned comparisons to [[Don Bradman]], widely regarded as the greatest batsman of all time, after becoming the youngest player to score a first-class double century with an [[not out|unbeaten]] 213 against the touring [[South African cricket team]]. The innings secured Craig's Test debut in the final match against South Africa, making him the youngest player to represent Australia in a Test, aged 17&nbsp;years and 239&nbsp;days. Craig started his Test career well, scoring 53 and 47 to ensure his selection for the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1953|1953 Ashes tour]], making him the youngest Australian player to tour England. Craig's arrival precipated media attention likening him to the arrival of Bradman in [[Australian cricket team in England in 1930|1930]], but he was performed poorly, failing to gain selection for all five Tests. 

Having missed a season due to [[conscription|national service]] and university studies, Craig returned to first-class cricket in 1955&ndash;56, earning himself a place in the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1956|1956 Ashes touring squad]]. Craig regained a Test position for the final two Tests of the series. Australia had suffered three consecutive [[The Ashes|Ashes]] series defeats and captain [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] and vice-captain [[Keith Miller]] retired upon arriving back in Australia. The selectors gambled on youth to rebuild the team, appointing Craig as the skipper for the 1957&ndash;58 tour of [[South Africa]] despite him having played in only six Tests and not being an established member of the team. Aged just 22&nbsp;years and 149&nbsp;days, Craig was the youngest captain in Test history and led a team derided as the worst to have left Australian shores. Craig led his team to a convincing 3&ndash;0 victory, but his batting was poor, averaging less than 20. He contracted [[hepatitis]] before the start of the 1958&ndash;59 season and withdrew from cricket. Craig returned in the following season for New South Wales, but could not regain his position in the Test team. He retired from first-class cricket at the age of just 26 as work commitments as a pharmacist increasingly restricted his ability to train. In later life, Craig was the managing director of the Australian subsidiary of the British pharmaceutical firm [[Boots]]. He has continued his involvement in cricket as an administrator, working with the [[New South Wales Cricket Association]], the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] Trust and the [[Bradman Museum]].

== Early years ==
Shortly after his birth in the rural town of [[Yass]], Craig's father John jokingly told his friends that "Australia's second [[Don Bradman]] has just been born".<ref name="r259">Robinson, p. 259.</ref> Having moved to [[Sydney]] from his home town at the age of three, Craig studied at [[North Sydney Boys High School]]. He showed his aptitude for ball sports from an early age.<Ref name="r259"/> Craig was a member of Australia's schoolboy [[baseball]] team for three years, making his first team at only 13&nbsp;years of age.<ref name="r259"/> He was also a member of the state's schoolboy [[rugby union]] team and captained the school team,<ref name="pollard">{{cite book | last = Pollard | first = Jack | year = 1969 | title = Cricket the Australian Way |page=p. 155}}</ref> but was only vice captain of the [[11_%28number%29#In_sports|First XI]] cricket team behind [[Peter Philpott]], another future Test player.<ref name="az"/> At the time, cricket was only his third priority.<Ref name="r259"/> He joined [[Mosman Cricket Club]] on Sydney's [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]] and scored a [[Sydney Grade Cricket|first-grade]] century at the age of 16.<Ref name="pollard"/> He was selected to make his first-class debut for [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] at the age of 16&nbsp;years and 249&nbsp;days, during the 1951&ndash;52 season, making him the youngest ever [[Sheffield Shield]] player.<ref name="r260">Robinson, p. 260.</ref><ref>Pollard, p. 54.</ref> He struck 91 against [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]] in his only first-class innings of the season,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1950S/1951-52/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1951-52_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html| title=Australian First-Class Season 1951/52: Batting - Most Runs| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-04}}</ref> before falling [[leg before wicket]].<ref name="r260"/> In January 1953, at the age of 17&nbsp;years and 207&nbsp;days, Craig became the youngest double centurion in the history of first-class cricket, in only his 13th innings.<ref name="az"/><Ref name="r260"/> He compiled 213 [[not out]] against the touring [[South African cricket team|South Africans]], helping to build a total of 416&nbsp;runs for the loss of seven [[dismissal (cricket)|wickets]] (7/416). Craig his runs quickly, making 98 of the 159&nbsp;runs scored in a [[partnership (cricket)|partnership]] with captain [[Keith Miller]],<ref name="pollard"/> a Test player known for his attacking strokeplay.<Ref name="miller"/> Craig brought up his double century by [[batting (cricket)|sweeping]] [[Hugh Tayfield]] for a [[four (cricket)|boundary]]. Craig is still the youngest Australian to have achieved the feat, although it is no longer a world record.<ref name="az"/><ref name="r260"/> The innings generated comparisons with [[Don Bradman]], widely regarded as the finest batsman in cricket history. Bradman had dominated Australian sports media coverage for two decades until his retirement in 1948 and the Australian public were eager for another sporting hero of his magnitude. Bradman was not playing first-class cricket at 17 and did not make his Test debut until the age of 20,<ref>Cashman, pp. 32&ndash;34.</ref> so Craig's quicker rise up the ranks caused much excitement. Miller cautioned against heaping so much media pressure on Craig, but the newspapers persisted, even comparing Craig's batting grip to that of Bradman.<ref name="r260"/><ref>Perry, pp. 206&ndash;207.</ref>

The double century caught the eye of Australian [[selector (sport)|selectors]] and Craig was selected for the Test team. He was named [[twelfth man]] for the Fourth Test, before making his debut in the Fifth Test after Miller and [[Ray Lindwall]] were rested.<ref name="az">Cashman, p. 67.</ref><ref name="p61">Pollard, p. 61.</ref> Craig had been one of the leading batsmen of the summer, scoring 867&nbsp;first-class runs at a [[batting average]] of 54.18 with seven [[century (cricket)|half-centuries]] in addition to his double century. This placed him fourth among Australian batsmen for the season in terms of run-scoring, with only leading Test batsman [[Neil Harvey]] averaging higher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1950S/1952-53/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1952-53_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html| title=Australian First-Class Season 1952/53: Batting - Most Runs| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-04}}</ref>

== Test debut ==
[[Image:Donald Bradman australian cricket player pic.JPG|Craig was one of many players burdened with the tag of being the "next [[Don Bradman|Bradman]]" (''pictured'').|left|thumb]]
Craig's debut Test was against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]].<ref name="testlist"/> At the age of 17&nbsp;years and 239&nbsp;days, he became the youngest ever Australian to play Test cricket.<ref name="az"/> He received a standing ovation from the 47,000-strong crowd as he walked out to bat under heavy public expectations.<ref name="r259"/><ref name="p209"/> According to [[Ray Robinson]], Craig walked out with "quick short steps, straight-backed as a pupil coming forward to receive a prize".<ref name="r259"/> Australia were comfortably positioned at 3/269 with his partner [[Neil Harvey]] on his way to a double century.<Ref name="p207"/> Short and slightly built at 173&nbsp;cm (5&nbsp;ft 8&nbsp;in) and {{convert|63|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}},<ref name="p209"/> Craig was a boy among men. In an innings marked by [[Batting_%28cricket%29#Types_of_batting_shots|leg glances]] and [[Batting_%28cricket%29#Types_of_batting_shots|fine cuts]], Craig progressed to 53 before the [[Cricket_ball#Condition_of_a_cricket_ball|new ball]] was taken. Craig hit a ball into the [[Fielding_%28cricket%29#Fielding_position_names_and_locations|covers]] and was [[caught (cricket)|caught]], ending the 148-run partnership with Harvey and silencing the crowd.<ref name="r259"/><ref name="p61"/><ref name="p207">Perry, p. 207.</ref> Craig top-scored in the second innings with 47, giving him exactly 100&nbsp;runs for the match.

Craig was selected for his first [[Australian cricket team in England in 1953|tour of England in 1953]] as the last player to make the cut,<Ref name="p64">Pollard, p. 64.</ref> after only 10&nbsp;first-class matches.<ref name="p208"/> The youngest Australian player ever to be sent to England, Craig was 15&nbsp;months younger than [[Clem Hill]] in 1896.<ref name="r260"/> He was again the centre of media speculation, with some media likening his arrival to Bradman's first [[Australian cricket team in England in 1930|tour of England in 1930]].<Ref name="p208"/> Bradman had scored a world Test series record of 974&nbsp;runs in 1930, a mark that remains unsurpassed.<Ref name="azb"/> However, the trip was unsuccessful: Craig made only 429&nbsp;runs in 27&nbsp;innings with a top score of 71 [[not out]] and was not selected for any Tests.<ref name="testlist"/><ref>{{cite web |title=First-class Batting and Fielding for Australians in Australia in England 1953 |url=http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/ENG/Australia_in_England_1953/f_Australians_Batting.html |publisher=[[Cricket Archive]] |accessdate=2008-04-09}}</ref> Craig had difficulty adjusting to the English pitch conditions and his confidence plummeted.<ref name="az"/><ref name="p208"/><ref name="r261">Robinson, p. 261.</ref> Craig has particular trouble against [[off cutter]]s on the [[seam bowling|seaming pitches]].<ref name="r261"/> In a reception at [[Lord's]], the home of cricket, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] asked him "I understand this is your first visit to England?", which prompted Craig to reply "Yes, your majesty, and unless my batting improves, it will be my last."<ref name="p208"/><ref name="r261"/><ref>Pollard, p. 71.</ref> Upon returning home, Craig was unable to maintain the level of performances that he displayed in the previous Australian summer.

== Youngest ever Australian captain ==
[[Image:Neil Harvey.jpg|Craig was unexpectedly made Test captain ahead of Neil Harvey (''pictured'').|thumb|right]]
The 1956&ndash;57 season marked the start of a renewal phase in Australian cricket. Australia had lost three consecutive [[The Ashes|Ashes]] series and had fallen from the heights of the [[australian cricket team in England in 1948|''Invincibles'']] of 1948. Australia were not scheduled to play any Tests until a tour of South Africa in 1957&ndash;58 and captain [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] and his deputy [[Keith Miller]] had retired upon their return to Australia, with both being in the late 30s.<ref name="az"/><ref name="miller">Cashman, pp. 212&ndash;213.</ref><Ref name="p209"/><Ref name="auslist"/><Ref>Cashman, p. 152.</ref> Craig replaced the retired Miller as state captain and staked his claim to be a part of Australia's long-term future with a consistent season in which he scored 521&nbsp;runs at an average of 47.36, with two centuries.<ref name="r262"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1950S/1956-57/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1956-57_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html| title=Australian First-Class Season 1956/57: Batting - Most Runs| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-04}}</ref> At the end of the 1956&ndash;57 season, the selectors met to choose a team for a short non-Test tour of [[New Zealand]]. The leading contender for the captaincy was 28-year-old Victorian [[Neil Harvey]], who had been a regular member of the team for eight years and was the senior batsman.<Ref name="azb">Cashman, pp. 18&ndash;19.</ref><ref>Cashman, pp. 118&ndash;119.</ref> Instead, the selectors thrust Craig into the leadership at the age of 21 and a half. He was a young player leading a young team&mdash;the youngest cricket team from any country to be sent overseas.<ref name="p115">Pollard, p. 115.</ref> It was seen as a bold move,<Ref name="az"/><Ref name="p209"/> as Craig had only played six Tests and was far from being a regular member of the team and had only a year of captaincy at first-class level. Craig was seen as being personable, level-headed and well educated and was seen as an investment in the future following a trough in Australian cricket during the 1950s.<Ref name="az"/><Ref name="p209"/> Personal skills were seen as important in an era when captains were expected to make many after-dinner speeches at functions on tours, especially to England.<Ref name="az"/><Ref name="p209"/> [[Ray Robinson]] opined that "a sincere nature and unassuming manner" reduced the risk of team friction in the rebuilding phase and that Craig was "level headed and tactful beyond his years".<Ref name="az"/> Craig's lack of leadership ambition was cited as a major reason for the improvement in team harmony.<ref name="p115"/>

In the 1957&ndash;58 season, the responsibility was raised to another level when Craig was made captain for the Test tour to [[South Africa]], making him the youngest captain in Test history at the age of 22&nbsp;years and 194&nbsp;days,<ref name="youngcapt">{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283416.html |title=Test matches - Youngest captains |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-04-09}}</ref> with Harvey as his deputy.<ref name="az"/> The appointment came despite his poor batting form during the New Zealand tour.

Craig led his team into the First Test at [[Johannesburg]] with an extremely inexperienced Test bowling attack. With Lindwall dropped,<ref name="p204"/> the [[fast bowling|pace attack]] was led by [[Alan Davidson (cricketer)|Alan Davidson]],<ref name="ad">Cashman, pp. 72&ndash;73.</ref> who at the time had managed only 16 Test wickets in 12&nbsp;matches.<Ref name="ad"/> Davidson's partner [[Ian Meckiff]] was making his debut. Benaud was in his first Test as the lead [[spin bowling|spinner]], while [[left arm unorthodox spin|left arm wristspinner]] [[Lindsay Kline]] was another debutant.<ref>{{cite web|title=1st Test:South Africa v Australia, Johannesburg Dec 23-28 1957|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62830.html| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref> In all, Craig's team had four debutants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62830.html |title=1st Test:South Africa v Australia at, Dec 23-28 1957 at Johannesburg |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-11-30}}</ref>  Craig made only 14 and 17 as his team held on for a draw.<Ref name="testlist"/> Craig again struggled with the bat in the Second Test in [[Cape Town]], making a [[duck (cricket)|duck]], but this was overlooked by the media as his team won its first Test by a decisive innings margin. In the Third Test at [[Durban]], Craig made 52 on a bowler-friendly pitch as Australia managed a draw, his first Test half-century since his debut.<ref name="testlist"/> In the Fourth Test at Johannesburg, Craig promoted Benaud ahead of him in the batting order, feeling that flexibility in the team interest was paramount.<ref name="p210"/> Benaud scored a century, prompting Robinson to describe Craig's action as "the most imaginative piece of captaincy of the season".<ref name="r263"/> The innings allowed Australia to seize the momentum and set up a 10-wicket victory.<ref name="r263"/> Craig failed to pass 20 in the Fifth Test as Australia won again to take a creditable 3&ndash;0 series win, something that was highly unexpected at the beginning of the tour.<ref name="p210"/> Overall, Craig's men won 11 of their 20&nbsp;first-class games on tour, and the ''South African Cricket Annual'' recognised the Australian captain's leadership by naming him as one of their Five Cricketers of the Year.<ref name="r264"/>

Although the match results were encouraging for such a young and inexperienced team, Craig's batting was a problem,<Ref name="p210"/> scoring only 103&nbsp;runs at 14.71.<ref name="testlist"/> Despite his contributions as a leader, Craig's batting was not up to standard.<ref name="az"/> He had trouble with his defensive skills, being bowled eight times in 17&nbsp;innings.<ref name="r263"/> The selectors avoided having to reverse their youth policy when Craig contracted a bout of [[hepatitis]] before the start of the 1958&ndash;59 season.<Ref name="az"/> Craig returned to cricket at the beginning of the season, but was underprepared, scoring two ducks in his only two innings of the season. Craig declared that he was not ready for a return to Test cricket and relinquished the Test captaincy, which the selectors handed to Benaud. Benaud went on to defeat England 4&ndash;0, widely regarded as the best team at the time, thereby establishing himself as captain of a resurgent Australia.<Ref name="azb"/><ref name="p210">Perry, p. 210.</ref>

The illness-enforced layoff left Craig facing an uphill battle to regain his place in the national team. In 1959&ndash;60, Craig recovered his health and had a moderately successful season, accumulating 376&nbsp;runs at 31.33 with three half-centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1950S/1959-60/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1959-60_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html| title=Australian First-Class Season 1959/60: Batting - Most Runs| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-04}}</ref> Despite this, the selectors named him to lead an [[Australia A cricket team|Australian Second XI]] to New Zealand while the first choice team toured the Indian subcontinent, hoping that he could still be good enough to secure a long-term future in the Australian team.<Ref name="az"/> Craig had strong Sheffield Shield seasons in 1960&ndash;61 and 1961&ndash;62, accumulating 710 and 629&nbsp;runs at respective averages of 59.16 and 37.00,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1960-61/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1960-61_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html| title=Australian First-Class Season 1960/61: Batting - Most Runs| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1961-62/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1961-62_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html| title=Australian First-Class Season 1961/62: Batting - Most Runs| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-04}}</ref> but found himself under increasing pressure for his place in the state team. New South Wales had a streak of nine consecutive Shield titles up until 1961&ndash;62,<Ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/260057.html|accessdate=2007-11-30|title=A history of the Sheffield Shield |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |first=Martin |last=Williamson}}</ref> and the batting lineup was particularly strong.<ref name="p210"/><ref>Perry, p. 233.</ref><ref>Perry, p. 244.</ref> In total, Craig acted as captain in 48&nbsp;matches first-class matches, winning 27, [[tie (cricket)|tieing]] one and losing only two.<ref name="az"/> Although Craig's record as the youngest captain in Test history has now surpassed,<ref name="youngcapt"/> he remains the youngest Australian to have scored a double century, gained Test selection and the national captaincy.<ref name="az"/>

== Style ==
Standing 173&nbsp;cm (5&nbsp;ft 8&nbsp;in) and weighing {{convert|63|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}},<ref name="p209"/> Craig was a lightly built and frail looking batsman.<ref name="pollard"/> He had a neat and compact batting style. Craig was known for his [[leg side]] batting repertoire, in particular his ability to clip the ball from his pads. He had an unorthodox grip, low on the bat handle with the back of the top hand pointing to [[Fielding (cricket)|point]]. This caused him to have a tendency to close the face of his bat.<ref name="r260"/> Although Craig was small in stature, he was still able to hit the ball a long distance. During the testimonial match for [[Lindsay Hassett]] at the end of the 1953&ndash;54 season, Craig struck four [[six (cricket)|sixes]] in five balls from the [[off spin]] of Johnson.<ref name="az"/><ref name="r261"/> During his first tour to England, Craig had difficulty with off cutters bowled by pacemen and eschwed the [[batting (cricket)|hook shot]],<Ref name="r261"/> but after his comeback from illness, he transformed himself into an opening batsman, earning praise for his performances against the express pace of [[Wes Hall]] and [[Ian Meckiff]].<ref name="r264">Robinson, p. 264.</ref> Benaud felt that Craig was finally reaping the rewards of his early experience.<ref name="r264"/> On Australian pitches, Craig had a reputation for having difficulty with the left arm wristspin of Kline and [[David Sincock]].<Ref name="r261"/> Craig's light build allowed him to move quickly while fielding, prompting Robinson to call him "the Bambi of the fielding side".<ref name="r260"/> In his early years, Craig was a non-smoker, but the pressure and tension brought on by the burden of captaincy resulted in him taking up the habit.<ref name="r263">Robinson, p. 263.</ref> He was known for being softly spoken, with his players often having to ask him to repeat his instructions.<ref name="r263"/> Craig had a reputation for being good-natured; he did not complain about his cricket career and said that he had "no regrets".<ref name="pollard"/><ref name="r261"/><ref name="r264"/><ref name="p211">Perry, p. 211.</ref>

== After cricket ==

Craig retired from first-class cricket at just 26&nbsp;years of age in 1962, but continued playing for [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]] in Sydney grade cricket on weekends until 1969.<ref name="az"/><ref name="r265">Robinson, p. 265.</ref> His marriage to Rosslyn Carroll<ref name="pollard"/><Ref name="az"/> and his pharmaceutical career prevented him from applying himself fully to cricket.<ref name="pollard"/><Ref name="az"/> The couple had a boy and a girl, as well as an adopted son. Craig joined the Australian subsidiary of the British pharmaceutical firm [[Boots]], rising to the position of managing director. He later served on the board of directors of the [[Bradman Museum]] in [[Bowral]] and later became its chairman. He was a member of the [[New South Wales Cricket Association]] Board for three years and served on the Trust of the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] for varying periods from 1968 to 1996, totalling 18&nbsp;years.<Ref>Perry, p. 201.</ref> Upon first being appointed in 1968 to replace [[Stan McCabe]], Craig was the youngest ever trustee of the SCG.<ref name="r265"/>  Craig retired as the managing director of Boots' Australian subsidiaries.<ref name="az"/>
