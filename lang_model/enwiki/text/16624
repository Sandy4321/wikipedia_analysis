'''Aniran''' is an ethno-linguistic term that signifies "non-[[Iranian peoples|Iranian]]" or "non-[[Greater Iran|Iran]]." Thus, in a general sense, 'Aniran' signifies lands where [[Iranian languages]] are not spoken. In a perjorative sense, it denotes "a political and religious enemy of Iran and [[Zoroastrianism]]."<ref name="Gignoux_Aneran">{{citation|last=Gignoux|first=Phillipe|chapter=An<U+0113>r<U+0101>n|volume=2|year=1987|title=Encyclopedia Iranica|location=New York|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|chapter-url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v2f1/v2f1a035.html}}:<!-- workaround {{citation}} page= parameter bug --> '''30-31'''</ref>

The term 'Aniran' derives from [[Middle Persian]] ''an<U+0113>r<U+0101>n'', [[Pahlavi]] ''<U+02C0>nyr<U+02C0>n'',  an antonym of ''[[Etymology of Iran|<U+0113>r<U+0101>n]]'' that in turn denoted either the people or the state of [[Sassanid]] Iran.<ref name="MacKenzie">{{citation|last=MacKenzie|first=David Niel|chapter=<U+0112>r<U+0101>n, <U+0112>r<U+0101>n<U+0161>ahr|year=1998|volume=8|title=Encyclopedia Iranica|publisher=Mazda|location=Cosa Mesa|chapter-url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v8f5/v8f545.html}}</ref> However, "in Zoroastrian literature and possibly in Sasanian<!-- do not change. In a quotation --> political thought as well, the term has also a markedly religious connotation. An ''an<U+0113>r'' person is not merely non-Iranian, but specifically non-Zoroastrian; and ''an<U+0113>r'' designates also worshipers of the [[daeva|''d<U+0113>ws'']] ("demons") or adherents of other religions." In these texts of the 9th-12th century, "Arabs and Turks [i.e. [[Turkmen people|Turkmens]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> are called ''an<U+0113>r'', as are Muslims generally, the latter in a veiled manner."<ref name="Gignoux_Aneran" />

==In inscriptions==
In official usage, the term is first attested in inscriptions of [[Shapur I]] (''r.'' 241-272), who styled himself the "king of kings of ''<U+0112>r<U+0101>n'' and ''An<U+0113>r<U+0101>n''." Shapur's claim to ''An<U+0113>r<U+0101>n'' reflected the emperor's victories over [[Valerian I|Valerian]] and [[Philip the Arab|Philip]], and staked a claim against the [[Roman Empire]], the enemies of the Sassanid state. This is also reflected in Shapur's inscription on the wall of the [[Kaba-ye Zardosht|Ka'ba-ye Zardosht]], where the emperor includes [[Syria]], [[Cappadocia]], and [[Cilicia]] - all three previously captured from the Romans - in his list of ''An<U+0113>r<U+0101>n''ian territories. <ref name="Gignoux_Aneran" />

The proclamation as "king of kings of <U+0112>r<U+0101>n and An<U+0113>r<U+0101>n" remained a stock epithet of subsequent Sassanid dynasts. Thirty years after Shapur, the Zoroastrian high-priest [[Kartir]] included Armenia and the Caucasus in his list of ''An<U+0113>r<U+0101>n''ian territories. In this, Kartir's inscription (also at Ka'ba-ye Zardosht) contradicts Shapur's, which included the same two regions in his list of regions of ''<U+0112>r<U+0101>n''.<ref name="Gignoux_Aneran" />

==In scripture and folklore==
Although first attested in a Sassanid-era proclamation, ''an<U+0113>r<U+0101>n'' - like ''<U+0113>r<U+0101>n'' - is conceptually several centuries older, appearing in the Younger [[Avesta]] as ''anarya'' where it denotes the "[[Turan]]ians" (the identification of the Turan/Aniran with a particular place is a historically distinct development, see above and below). These "Turanians" of Aniran, apparently the traditional enemies of the [[Avestan|Avestan-speaking]] peoples, appear in Zoroastrian cosmogony and cosmology as the noxious folk of the sixteen lands created by [[Angra Mainyu]] (''Vendidad'' 1.18). These lands lay beyond the [[Aredvi_Sura_Anahita#As_a_cosmological_entity|the world river that encircled]] the sixteen lands created by [[Ahura Mazda]], the first of which was [[Airyanem Vaejah]], where the Iranians lived.

In the 9th-12th century Zoroastrian texts, the legendary Turanian king and military commander [[Afrasiab]] is (together with [[Zahhak|Dahag]] and [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]) the most hated among the beings that Ahriman (Avestan [[Angra Mainyu]]) set against the Iranians (''Zand-i Vahman Yasht'' 7.32; ''Menog-i Khrad'' 8.29)<ref name="Yarshater">{{citation|last=Yarshater|first=Ehsan|chapter=Afr<U+0101>s<U+012B><U+0101>b|title=Encyclopedia Iranica|volume=1|year=1983|location=New York|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul}}: '''570-576'''</ref>

In the ''[[Shahnameh]]'', the poet [[Ferdowsi]] draws on Zoroastrian scripture (with due attribution) and retains the association of ''Aneran'' with the Turanians. The poet however specifically places them beyond the [[Oxus]] river and identifies the Turanians as "Turks" (the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]]). From the point of view of Ferdowsi's home in [[Khorasan]], this identification coincides with the Avestan notion (e.g. [[Vendidad|Vd]] 7.2, 19.1) that the lands of Angra Mainyu ([[Middle Persian|MP]]: Ahriman) lay to the north. The two sources do however diverge with respect to details: In the Avesta, Sogdiana (Avestan ''Sughdha'', present-day [[Sughd]] & [[Samarqand Province|Samarqand]]) is not Aniran - Sogdiana is one of the sixteen lands created by Mazda, not one of the lands of Angra Mainyu.

Nonetheless, for Ferdowsi the division between Iran and Aniran is just as rigid as it is in the Avesta: When the primordial king [[Fereydun]] (Avestan ''Thraetaona'') divides his kingdom - the whole world - among his three sons, he gives the Semitic lands in the west to the eldest, the lands of the north to his middle son Tur (Avestan ''Turya'', hence the name "Turanian"), and Iran to his youngest (''Shahnameh'' 1.189<ref name="Dhalla">{{citation|last=Dhalla|first=Maneckji N.|year=1922|title=Zoroastrian Civilization|location=New York|publisher=OUP}}: '''5-6'''</ref>). In the story, this partition leads to a family feud in which an alliance of the two elder sons (who rule over the Aniranian lands) battle the forces of the youngest (the Iranians). The Iranians win.

For Ferdowsi, the Turanians/Aniranians (often used interchangeably) are unquestionable the villains of the piece. The conflict with Iranians is the main theme of the ''Shahnameh'' and accounts for more than half of the text.<ref name="Yarshater" /> The deaths of heroes and other admirable figures are frequently attributed to Turanians. So also ''Shahnameh'' 5.92,<ref name="Jackson">{{citation|last=Williams Jackson|first=A.V.|year=1899|title=Zoroaster, the prophet of ancient Iran|location=New York|publisher=Columbia UP}}: '''130-131'''</ref> that has a Turanian raider named Tur-Baratur killing the 77-year-old [[Zoroaster]] in [[Balkh]].
