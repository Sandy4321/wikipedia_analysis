"'''Sleepless'''" is the 4th episode of the [[The X-Files (season 2)|second season]], and 28th overall of the [[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[The X-Files]]''. The episode first aired in the United States and Canada on October 7, 1994. "Sleepless" subsequently aired in the United Kingdom, Ireland and was eventually released for broadcast to mainland [[Europe]]. The story was written by [[television producer|supervising producer]] [[Howard Gordon]], and directed by [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]]. "Sleepless" featured what would become the [[recurring character]] of [[Alex Krycek]], portrayed by [[Nicholas Lea]].

The episode centers around [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and his new partner Krycek investigating a case where doctors and soldiers who were part of a sleep deprivation experiment are being killed off. Although the episode earned a mediocre [[Nielsen rating|Nielsen household]] and [[Syndication|syndication ratings]] in the United States compared to previous episodes of the season, it was generally well-received by fans and critics alike.

The episodes writer [[Howard Gordon]] was inspired by various cases of [[insomnia]]. During the first season, [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] had written a similar themed episode, but stopped working on it, when he became "un-happy" with the end-results.

== Plot overview ==
In Manhattan, Dr. Saul Grisson finds a fire outside his apartment. By the time the fire fighters arrive they find no fire or fire damage, but do fine Dr. Grisson, dead. Fox Mulder receives a tape cassette with his newspaper that includes Dr. Grissom's 911 call. Mulder brings it to Assistant Director [[Walter Skinner]]'s attention, but a young agent, [[Alex Krycek]] opened the case first. Mulder calls former partner [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) and asks her to perform an autopsy on Dr. Grissom's corpse. Mulder heads to the Grissom Sleep Disorder Center in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] and is confronted by Krycek soon afterwards, upset at Mulder for ditching him. The two head down to [[FBI Academy|Quantico]] to see Scully, who says that Dr. Grissom's body shows no signs of a fire, but it seems as if his body believed it was burning.<ref name="plot1"/><ref name="plot2"/>

In a Brooklyn apartment, Henry Willig, a Vietnam veteran is approached by his fellow Marine, Augustus Cole. Suddenly a group of wounded Vietnamese appear and gun him down. Examining his corpse, Mulder and Krycek find a scar on his neck and realize he was stationed in the Special Forces in Vietnam in 1970, one of only two survivors, the other being Augustus Cole. They head to the V.A. Medical Center in New Jersey where Cole is being held, only to find that he was discharged, despite the fact that his doctor doesn't remember doing so.<ref name="plot1"/><ref name="plot2"/>

Mulder receives a phone call from the mysterious "[[X (The X-Files)|X]]", who meets with him and gives him information on a secret military project that Dr. Grissom performed where he eradicated the need for sleep. "X" provides him with the name of another member of the squad who was mistakenly reported as killed in action. A man matching Cole's description robs a drug store and the SWAT team members coming after him shoot each other. Mulder believes that Cole's years of sleeplessness have provided him with telekinetic abilities. Mulder and Krycek meet with Matola soon afterwards, who says that he hasn't slept in 24 years due to the experiment. He reveals that there was another doctor who was part of the squad, Dr. Girardi.<ref name="plot1"/><ref name="plot2"/>

Mulder and Krycek head to the subway station, where Dr. Girardi is expected to arrive due to Dr. Grissom's funeral. Mulder sees Cole there, and Cole shoots Dr. Girardi, but this event is actually all in Mulder's head. In reality, Cole has captured Dr. Girardi and holds him hostage, about to show him a similar fate as his other victims. By searching surveillance equipment they track his location and find Dr. Girardi wounded. Mulder finds Cole, who is ready to kill himself. Krycek, thinking Cole is holding a gun instead of the Bible he is actually holding, shoots him. Mulder and Scully find all of their files on the case missing. Krycek reports to the "[[Cigarette Smoking Man]]" and others, telling them Scully is a bigger problem then they anticipated.<ref name="plot1">{{cite book | year=1995 | author=Lowry, Brian | title=The Truth is Out There: The Official Guide to the X-Files|page=169-170|publisher=Harper Prism }} </ref><ref name="plot2">{{cite book | year=1996 | author=Lovece, Frank | title=The X-Files Declassified|page=114-116|publisher=Citadel Press }} </ref>
