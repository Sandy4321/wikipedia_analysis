'''Phagocytes''' are [[cell (biology)|cell]]s that protect the body by ingesting ([[phagocytosis|phagocytosing]]) harmful foreign particles, [[bacteria]], and dead or [[Apoptosis|dying]] cells. Their name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''phagein'', "to eat" or "devour", and "-cyte", the suffix in biology denoting "cell", from the Greek ''kutos'', "hollow vessel".<ref name=ox>{{cite book|authors=Little, C., Fowler H.W., Coulson J.| title=The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary| publisher=Oxford University Press (Guild Publishing)| year=1983|pages=1566<U+2013>67}}</ref> They are essential for fighting infections and for subsequent [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].<ref name=USC>{{cite web| last = Mayer| first = Gene|title=Immunology&nbsp;<U+2014> Chapter One: Innate (non-specific) Immunity| work = Microbiology and Immunology On-Line Textbook| publisher = USC School of Medicine| year = 2006|url=http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/ghaffar/innate.htm| accessdate = November 12, 2008}}</ref> Phagocytes are important throughout the animal kingdom<ref name=Delves250>{{Harvnb|Delves|Martin|Burton|Roit|2006|p=250}}</ref> and are highly developed within vertebrates.<ref>{{Harvnb|Delves|Martin|Burton|Roit|2006|p=251}}</ref> One [[litre]] of human blood contains about six billion phagocytes.<ref name=Hoff-values>{{Harvnb|Hoffbrand|Pettit|Moss|2005|p=331}}</ref> They were first discovered in 1882 by [[Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov]] while he was studying [[starfish]] [[larva]]e.<ref name= Ilya>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1908/mechnikov-bio.html Ilya Mechnikov], retrieved on November 28, 2008.

During an infection, chemical signals attract phagocytes to places where the pathogen has invaded the body. These chemicals may come from bacteria or from other phagocytes already present. The phagocytes move by a method called [[chemotaxis]]. When phagocytes come into contact with bacteria, the receptors on the phagocyte's surface will bind to them.  This binding will lead to the engulfing of the bacteria by the phagocyte.<ref name=money/> Some phagocytes kill the ingested pathogen with [[reactive oxygen species|oxidants]] and [[nitric oxide]].<ref name=pmid15378046>{{cite journal |author=Fang FC |title=Antimicrobial reactive oxygen and nitrogen species: concepts and controversies |journal=Nat.

== History ==
[[Image:Dr Metchnikoff in his Laboratory.jpg|thumb|300px|Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov in his laboratory|alt=A bearded old man holding up a test tube. He is sitting at a table by a window. The table is covered with many small bottles and test tubes.]]
The Russian zoologist [[Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov]] (1845<U+2013>1916) first recognized that specialized cells were involved in defense against microbial infections. In 1882, he studied [[motility|motile]] (freely moving) cells in the [[larva]]e of [[Sea star|starfishes]], believing they were important to the animals' immune defenses. To test his idea, he inserted small thorns from a [[tangerine]] tree into the larvae.  After a few hours he noticed that the motile cells had surrounded the thorns.<ref>{{Harvnb|Delves|Martin|Burton|Roit|2006|p=3}}</ref> Mechnikov traveled to [[Vienna]] and shared his ideas with [[Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Claus|Carl Friedrich Claus]] who suggested the name <U+2018><U+2018>phagocyte<U+2019><U+2019> (from the Greek words ''phagein'', meaning "to eat or devour", and ''kutos'', meaning "hollow vessel"<ref name=ox />) for the cells that Mechnikov had observed.<ref name="pmid9544583">{{cite journal

A year later, Mechnikov studied a fresh water [[crustacean]] called ''[[Daphnia]]'', a tiny transparent animal that can be examined directly under a microscope. He discovered that fungal spores that attacked the animal were destroyed by phagocytes. He went on to extend his observations to the white blood cells of mammals and discovered that the [[Bacteria|bacterium]] ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process that he called [[phagocytosis]].<ref name=autogenerated5>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1908/mechnikov-bio.html|title=Ilya Mechnikov|accessdate=November 28, 2008|publisher=The Nobel Foundation}}</ref> Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.

In 1903, [[Almroth Wright]] discovered that phagocytosis was reinforced by specific [[antibody|antibodies]] that he called [[opsonin]]s, from the Greek ''[[opson]]'', "a dressing or relish".<ref>{{Harvnb|Delves|Martin|Burton|Roit|2006|p=263}}</ref> Mechnikov  was awarded (jointly with [[Paul Ehrlich]]) the 1908 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his work on phagocytes and phagocytosis.<ref name= Paul/>

Although the importance of these discoveries slowly gained acceptance during the early twentieth century, the intricate relationships between phagocytes and all the other components of the immune system were not known until the 1980s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Robinson|Babcock|1998|p=vii}}</ref>

== Phagocytosis ==
{{main|Phagocytosis}}
[[Image:Phagocytosis in three steps.png|thumb|Phagocytosis in three steps: 1. Unbound phagocyte surface receptors do not trigger phagocytosis. 2. Binding of receptors causes them to cluster. 3.

Phagocytosis is the process of taking in particles such as bacteria, parasites, [[apoptosis|dead host cells]], and cellular and foreign debris by a cell.<ref name=superman2>{{Harvnb|Ernst|Stendahl|2006|p=4}}</ref> It involves a chain of molecular processes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ernst|Stendahl|2006|p=78}}</ref> Phagocytosis occurs after the foreign body, a bacterial cell, for example, has bound to molecules called "receptors" that are on the surface of the phagocyte. The phagocyte then stretches itself around the bacterium and engulfs it. Phagocytosis of bacteria by human neutrophils takes on average nine minutes.<ref name="pmid8301210">{{cite journal | author = Hampton MB, Vissers MC, Winterbourn CC | title = A single assay for measuring the rates of phagocytosis and bacterial killing by neutrophils | journal = J.

Within one minute the phagosome merges with either a [[lysosome]] or a [[Granule (cell biology)|granule]] to form a [[phagolysosome]]. The bacterium is then subjected to an overwhelming array of killing mechanisms<ref>{{Harvnb|Delves|Martin|Burton|Roit|2006|pp=6<U+2013>7}}</ref> and is dead a few minutes later.<ref name="pmid8301210"/> Dendritic cells and macrophages are not so fast, and phagocytosis can take many hours in these cells. Macrophages are slow and untidy eaters; they engulf huge quantities of material and frequently release some undigested back into the tissues. This debris serves as a signal to recruit more phagocytes from the blood.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sompayrac|2008|p=3}}</ref> Phagocytes have voracious appetites; scientists have even fed macrophages with [[iron filings]] and then used a small magnet to separate them from other cells.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sompayrac|2008|p=2}}</ref>

A phagocyte has many types of receptors on its surface that are used to bind material.<ref name=USC/> They include  [[opsonin]] receptors, [[scavenger receptor]]s, and [[Toll-like receptors]]. Opsonin receptors increase the phagocytosis of bacteria that have been coated with [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG) [[antibodies]] or with [[complement system|complement]]. "Complement" is the name given to a complex series of protein molecules found in the blood that destroy cells or mark them for destruction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sompayrac|2008|pp=13<U+2013>16}}</ref> Scavenger receptors bind to a large range of molecules on the surface of bacterial cells, and Toll-like receptors<U+2014>so called because of their similarity to well-studied receptors in fruit flies that are encoded by the [[Toll (gene)|Toll gene]]<U+2014>bind to more specific molecules. Binding to Toll-like receptors increases phagocytosis and causes the phagocyte to release a group of hormones that cause [[inflammation]].<ref name=USC/>

=== Oxygen-dependent intracellular ===
When a phagocyte ingests bacteria (or any material), its oxygen consumption increases. The increase in oxygen consumption, called a [[respiratory burst]], produces reactive oxygen-containing molecules that are anti-microbial.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Respiratory burst in human neutrophils.|journal=Journal of Immunological Methods|date=December 17, 1999|first=C|last=Dahlgren|coauthors=A Karlsson|volume=232|issue=1<U+2013>2|pages=3<U+2013>14|pmid=10618505|doi=10.1016/S0022-1759(99)00146-5|ref=harv}}</ref>  The oxygen compounds are toxic to both the invader and the cell itself, so they are kept in compartments inside the cell. This method of killing invading microbes by using the reactive oxygen-containing molecules is referred to as oxygen-dependent intracellular killing, of which there are two types.<ref name = pmid15378046/>

The first type is the oxygen-dependent production of a [[superoxide]],<ref name=USC/>  which is an oxygen-rich bacteria-killing substance.<ref>{{cite journal|title=NADPH oxidase.|journal=The international journal of biochemistry and cell biology.|year=1996|first=KP|last=Shatwell|coauthors=AW Segal|volume=28|issue=11|pages=1191<U+2013>95|pmid=9022278|doi=10.1016/S1357-2725(96)00084-2|ref=harv}}</ref> The superoxide  is converted to [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[singlet oxygen]] by an enzyme called [[superoxide dismutase]]. Superoxides also react with the hydrogen peroxide to produce [[hydroxyl radicals]], which assist in killing the invading microbe.<ref name=USC/>

Phagocytes can also kill microbes by oxygen-independent methods, but these are not as effective as the oxygen-dependent ones. There are four main types. The first uses electrically charged proteins that damage the bacterium's [[cell membrane|membrane]]. The second type uses lysozymes; these enzymes break down the bacterial [[cell wall]]. The third type uses [[lactoferrin]]s, which are present in neutrophil granules and remove essential iron from bacteria.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hoffbrand|Pettit|Moss|2005|p=118}}</ref> The fourth type uses [[proteases]] and [[hydrolytic enzymes]]; these enzymes are used to digest the proteins of destroyed bacteria.<ref>{{Harvnb|Delves|Martin|Burton|Roit|2006|pp=6<U+2013>10}}</ref>

=== Extracellular ===
[[Interferon-gamma]]<U+2014>which was once called macrophage activating factor<U+2014>stimulates macrophages to produce [[nitric oxide]]. The source of interferon-gamma can be [[CD4+ T cells|CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells]], [[CD8+ T cells|CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells]], [[NK cell|natural killer cells]], [[B cells]], [[NKT cell|natural killer T cells]], monocytes, macrophages, or dendritic cells.<ref name="pmid14525967">{{cite journal | author = Schroder K, Hertzog PJ, Ravasi T, Hume DA | title = Interferon-gamma: an overview of signals, mechanisms and functions | journal = J.

=== Viruses ===
[[Virus]]es can reproduce only inside cells, and they gain entry by using many of the receptors involved in immunity. Once inside the cell, viruses use the cell's biological machinery to their own advantage, forcing the cell to make hundreds of identical copies of themselves. Although phagocytes and other components of the innate immune system can, to a limited extent, control viruses, once a virus is inside a cell the adaptive immune responses, particularly the lymphocytes, are more important for defense.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sompayrac|2008|p=7}}</ref>  At the sites of viral infections, lymphocytes often vastly outnumber all the other cells of the immune system; this is common in viral [[meningitis]].<ref name="pmid17962876">{{cite journal | author = de Almeida SM, Nogueira MB, Raboni SM, Vidal LR | title = Laboratorial diagnosis of lymphocytic meningitis | journal = Braz J Infect Dis | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 489<U+2013>95 |date=October 2007 | pmid = 17962876 | doi = 10.1590/s1413-86702007000500010| url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1413-86702007000500010&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en | accessdate = March 29, 2009 | ref = harv}}</ref> Virus-infected cells that have been killed by lymphocytes are cleared from the body by phagocytes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sompayrac|2008|p=22}}</ref>

{{main|Apoptosis}}
[[Image:Apoptosis.png|thumb|Apoptosis<U+2014>phagocytes clear fragments of dead cells from the body]]

== Interactions with other cells ==
Phagocytes are usually not bound to any particular [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] but move through the body interacting with the other phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells of the immune system. They can communicate with other cells by producing chemicals called [[cytokines]], which recruit other phagocytes to the site of infections or stimulate dormant [[lymphocyte]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sompayrac|2008|p=44}}</ref>  Phagocytes form part of the [[innate immune system]], which animals, including humans, are born with. Innate immunity is very effective but non-specific in that it does not discriminate between different sorts of invaders. On the other hand, the [[adaptive immune system]] of jawed vertebrates<U+2014>the basis of acquired immunity<U+2014>is highly specialized and can protect against almost any type of invader.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sompayrac|2008|p=4}}</ref> The adaptive immune system is not dependent on phagocytes but lymphocytes, which produce protective proteins called [[antibody|antibodies]], which tag invaders for destruction and prevent [[virus]]es from infecting cells.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sompayrac|2008|pp=24<U+2013>35}}</ref> Phagocytes, in particular dendritic cells and macrophages, stimulate lymphocytes to produce antibodies by an important process called [[antigen]] presentation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Delves|Martin|Burton|Roit|2006|pp=171<U+2013>184}}</ref>

Antigen presentation is a process in which some phagocytes move parts of engulfed materials back to the surface of their cells and "present" them to other cells of the immune system.<ref>{{Harvnb|Delves|Martin|Burton|Roit|2006|pp=456}}</ref> There are two "professional" antigen-presenting cells: macrophages and dendritic cells.<ref name= paper>{{cite web|url=http://pim.medicine.dal.ca/apc.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080112211805/http://pim.medicine.dal.ca/apc.htm|archivedate=2008-01-12|title=Antigen Presenting Cells (APC)|accessdate=November 12, 2008|publisher=Dalhousie University|work=Immunology for 1st Year Medical Students|author=Timothy Lee|year=2004}}</ref> After  engulfment, foreign proteins (the [[antigen]]s) are broken down into [[peptide]]s inside dendritic cells and macrophages. These peptides are then bound to the cell's [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) glycoproteins, which carry the peptides back to the phagocyte's surface where they can be "presented" to lymphocytes.<ref name=ATP/> Mature macrophages do not travel far from the site of infection, but dendritic cells can reach the body's [[lymph node]]s, where there are millions of lymphocytes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Delves|Martin|Burton|Roit|2006|p=161}}</ref> This enhances immunity because the lymphocytes respond to the antigens presented by the dendritic cells just as they would at the site of the original infection.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sompayrac|2008|p=8}}</ref> But dendritic cells can also destroy or pacify lymphocytes if they recognize components of the host body; this is necessary to prevent autoimmune reactions.

=== Immunological tolerance ===
{{main|Immunological tolerance}}
Dendritic cells also promote immunological tolerance,<ref name=somethingcool>{{cite journal | author = Lange C, D<U+00FC>rr M, Doster H, Melms A, Bischof F | title = Dendritic cell-regulatory T-cell interactions control self-directed immunity | journal = Immunol.

The first type of tolerance is [[central tolerance]]: When [[T cell]]s first depart from the [[thymus]], dendritic cells destroy the T cells that carry antigens that would cause the immune system to attack itself. The second type of immunological tolerance is [[peripheral tolerance]]. Some T cells that possess antigens that would cause them to attack "self" slip through the first process of tolerance, some T cells develop self-attacking antigens later in life, and some self-attacking antigens are not found in the thymus; because of this, dendritic cells will work, again, to restrain the activities of self-attacking T cells outside of the thymus. Dendritic cells can do this by destroying them or by recruiting the help of [[regulatory T cell]]s to inactivate the harmful T cells' activities.<ref name=rocky>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockefeller.edu/labheads/steinman/dendritic_intro/immuneTolerance.php|title=Dendritic Cells and Immune Tolerance|accessdate=February 15, 2009|last=Steinman|first=Ralph M.|year=2004|publisher=The Rockefeller University}}</ref> When immunological tolerance fails, [[autoimmune disease]]s can follow.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Immunological tolerance and autoimmunity|journal=Internal and emergency medicine.|year=2006|first=S|last=Romagnani|volume=1|issue=3|pages=187<U+2013>96|pmid=17120464|doi=10.1007/BF02934736|ref=harv}}</ref> On the other hand, too much tolerance allows some infections, like [[HIV]], to go unnoticed.<ref name=rocky />

== Professional phagocytes ==
[[Image:Myeloid cells.png|thumb|300px|Phagocytes derive from stem cells in the bone marrow|alt=A cartoon showing the relationships between a stem cell and mature white blood cells. Eight different types of white blood cell can derive from the same stem cell.]]
Phagocytes of humans and other jawed vertebrates are divided into "professional" and "non-professional" groups based on the efficiency with which they participate in phagocytosis.<ref name=Ernst186/> The  professional phagocytes are the [[monocytes]], [[macrophages]], [[neutrophils]], tissue  [[dendritic cell]]s and [[mast cell]]s.<ref name= Rob/> One [[litre]] of human blood contains about six billion phagocytes.<ref name=Hoff-values/>

=== Activation ===
All phagocytes, and especially macrophages, exist in degrees of readiness.  Macrophages are usually relatively dormant in the tissues and proliferate slowly. In this semi-resting state,  they clear  away dead host cells and other non-infectious debris and rarely take part in antigen presentation.  But, during an infection, they receive chemical signals<U+2014>usually [[interferon gamma]]<U+2014>which increases their production of [[MHC class II|MHC II]] molecules and which prepares them for presenting antigens.  In this state, macrophages are good antigen presenters and  killers.  However, if they receive a signal directly from an invader, they become "hyperactivated", stop proliferating, and concentrate on killing. Their size and rate of phagocytosis increases<U+2014>some become large enough to engulf  invading [[protozoa]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Sompayrac|2008|pp=16<U+2013>17}}</ref>

In the blood, neutrophils are inactive but are swept along at high speed.  When they receive signals from macrophages at the sites of inflammation, they slow down and leave the blood.   In the tissues, they are activated by cytokines and arrive at the battle scene ready to kill.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sompayrac|2008|pp=18<U+2013>19}}</ref>

=== Migration ===
[[Image:NeutrophilerAktion.png|thumb|upright|Neutrophils move from the blood to the site of infection|alt=A cartoon depicting a blood vessel and its surrounding tissue cells. There are three similar white blood cells, one in the blood and two among the tissue cells. The ones in the tissue are producing granules that can destroy bacteria.]]
When an infection occurs, a chemical "SOS" signal is given off to attract phagocytes to the site.<ref>{{Harvnb|Delves|Martin|Burton|Roit|2006|p=6}}</ref> These chemical signals may include proteins from invading [[bacteria]], clotting system [[peptides]], [[Complement system|complement]] products, and cytokines that have been given off by macrophages located in the tissue near the infection site.<ref name=USC/> Another group of chemical attractants are [[cytokines]] that recruit neutrophils and monocytes from the blood.<ref name=money>Janeway, Chapter: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=migration&rid=imm.section.203#206 Induced innate responses to infection.]</ref>

To reach the site of infection, phagocytes leave the bloodstream and enter the affected tissues. Signals from the infection cause the [[endothelial]] cells that line the blood vessels to make a protein called [[selectin]], which neutrophils stick to on passing by. Other signals called [[vasodilator]]s loosen the junctions connecting endothelial cells, allowing the phagocytes to pass through the wall. [[Chemotaxis]] is the process by which phagocytes follow the cytokine "scent" to the infected spot.<ref name=USC/> Neutrophils travel across [[epithelial]] cell-lined organs to sites of infection, and although this is an important component of fighting infection, the migration itself can result in disease-like symptoms.<ref name="pmid14519390">{{cite journal | author = Zen K, Parkos CA | title = Leukocyte-epithelial interactions | journal = Curr.

=== Monocytes ===
{{main|Monocytes}}
[[File:Monocytes, a type of white blood cell (Giemsa stained).jpg|thumb|Monocytes in blood ([[Giemsa stain]])]]
Monocytes develop in the bone marrow and reach maturity in the blood. Mature monocytes have large, smooth, lobed nuclei and abundant [[cytoplasm]] that contains granules. Monocytes ingest foreign or dangerous substances and present [[antigens]] to other cells of the immune system. Monocytes form two groups: a circulating group and a marginal group that remain in other tissues (approximately 70% are in the marginal group). Most monocytes leave the blood stream after 20<U+2013>40 hours to travel to tissues and organs and in doing so transform into macrophages<ref>{{Harvnb|Hoffbrand|Pettit|Moss|2005|p=117}}</ref> or dendritic cells depending on the signals they receive.<ref>{{Harvnb|Delves|Martin|Burton|Roit|2006|pp=1<U+2013>6}}</ref> There are about 500 million monocytes in one litre of human blood.<ref name=Hoff-values />

=== Macrophages ===
{{main|Macrophages}}
Mature macrophages do not travel far but stand guard over those areas of the body that are exposed to the outside world. There they act as garbage collectors, antigen presenting cells, or ferocious killers, depending on the signals they receive.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sompayrac|2008|p=45}}</ref> They derive from monocytes, [[granulocyte]] stem cells, or the  [[cell division]] of pre-existing macrophages.<ref name="pmid8870002">{{cite journal

This type of phagocyte does not have granules but contains many [[lysosome]]s. Macrophages are found throughout the body in almost all tissues and organs (e.g., [[microglial cell]]s in the [[brain]] and  [[pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] macrophages in the [[lungs]]), where they silently lie in wait. A macrophage's location can determine its size and appearance. Macrophages  cause inflammation through the production of [[interleukin-1]], [[interleukin-6]], and [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNF-alpha]].<ref name=USCmac>{{cite web| last = Bowers| first = William|title=Immunology -Chapter Thirteen: Immunoregulation| work = Microbiology and Immunology On-Line Textbook| publisher = USC School of Medicine| year = 2006|url=http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/bowers/imm-reg.htm| accessdate = November 14, 2008}}</ref> Macrophages are usually only found in tissue and are rarely seen in blood circulation. The life-span of tissue macrophages has been estimated to range from four to fifteen days.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ernst|Stendahl|2006|p=8}}</ref>

Macrophages can be activated to perform functions that a resting monocyte cannot.<ref name=USCmac/> [[T helper cell]]s (also known as effector T cells or T<sub>h</sub> cells), a sub-group of lymphocytes, are responsible for the activation of macrophages. T<sub>h</sub>1 cells activate macrophages by signaling with [[IFN-gamma]] and displaying the protein [[CD40 ligand]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Delves|Martin|Burton|Roit|2006|p=156}}</ref> Other signals include TNF-alpha and [[lipopolysaccharides]] from bacteria.<ref name=USCmac/> T<sub>h</sub>1 cells can recruit other phagocytes to the site of the infection in several ways. They secrete cytokines that act on the [[bone marrow]] to stimulate the production of monocytes and neutrophils, and they secrete some of the [[cytokine]]s that are responsible for the migration of monocytes and neutrophils out of the bloodstream.<ref>{{Harvnb|Delves|Martin|Burton|Roit|2006|p=187}}</ref> T<sub>h</sub>1 cells come from the [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells once they have responded to antigen in the [[lymphatic system|secondary lymphoid tissues]].<ref name=USCmac/>  Activated macrophages play a potent role in [[tumor]] destruction  by producing TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, nitric oxide, reactive oxygen compounds, [[cation]]ic proteins, and hydrolytic enzymes.<ref name=USCmac/>

A pathogen is only successful in infecting an organism if it can get past its defenses. Pathogenic bacteria and protozoa have developed a variety of methods to resist attacks by phagocytes, and many actually survive and replicate within phagocytic cells.<ref name=chicken>{{cite web|url=http://textbookofbacteriology.net/antiphago.html|title=Mechanisms of Bacterial Pathogenicity: Bacterial Defense Against Phagocytes|accessdate=December 10, 2008|last=Todar|first=Kenneth|publisher=2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Alexander J, Satoskar AR, Russell DG |title=Leishmania species: models of intracellular parasitism |journal=J.

=== Avoiding contact ===
There are several ways bacteria avoid contact with phagocytes. First, they can grow in sites that phagocytes are not capable of traveling to (e.g., the surface of unbroken skin). Second, bacteria can suppress the [[inflammatory response]]; without this response to infection phagocytes cannot respond adequately. Third, some species of bacteria can inhibit the ability of phagocytes to travel to the site of infection by interfering with chemotaxis.<ref name=chicken/> Fourth, some bacteria can avoid contact with phagocytes by tricking the immune system into "thinking" that the bacteria are "self".

=== Killing ===
Bacteria have developed several ways of killing phagocytes.<ref name="pmid16322743" /> These include [[cytolysin]]s, which form pores in the phagocyte's cell membranes, [[streptolysins]] and [[leukocidin]]s, which  cause neutrophils' granules to rupture and release toxic substances,<ref name="pmid15819624">{{cite journal| author = Datta V, Myskowski SM, Kwinn LA, Chiem DN, Varki N, Kansal RG, Kotb M, Nizet V| title = Mutational analysis of the group A streptococcal operon encoding streptolysin S and its virulence role in invasive infection| journal = Mol.

== Host damage by phagocytes ==
Macrophages and neutrophils, in particular, play a central role in the inflammatory process by releasing proteins and small-molecule inflammatory mediators that control infection but can damage host tissue. In general, phagocytes aim to destroy pathogens by engulfing them and subjecting them to a battery of toxic chemicals inside a [[phagolysosome]].  If a phagocyte fails to engulf its target, these toxic agents can be released into the environment (an action referred to as "frustrated phagocytosis"). As these agents are also toxic to host cells, they can cause extensive damage to healthy cells and tissues.<ref>Paoletti pp. 426<U+2013>30</ref>

When neutrophils release their granule contents in the [[kidney]], the contents of the granule (reactive oxygen compounds and proteases) degrade the [[extracellular matrix]] of host cells and can cause damage to [[glomerular]] cells, affecting their ability to filter blood and causing changes in shape. In addition, [[phospholipase]] products (e.g., [[leukotrienes]]) intensify the damage. This release of substances promotes chemotaxis of more neutrophils to the site of infection, and glomerular cells can be damaged further by the adhesion molecules during the migration of neutrophils. The injury done to the glomerular cells can cause [[renal failure]].<ref name="pmid10430993">{{cite journal
