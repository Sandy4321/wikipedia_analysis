The '''San Mateo Mountains''' are a small [[mountain range]] in [[Cibola County, New Mexico|Cibola]] and [[McKinley County, New Mexico|McKinley]] counties of [[New Mexico]], in the southwestern [[United States]].  The highest point in the range is [[Mount Taylor (New Mexico)|Mount Taylor]], at 11,301 ft (3,445 m).  The range lies just northeast of the community of [[Grants, New Mexico|Grants]], and about 60 miles (100 km) west of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]].  This range should not be confused with the [[San Mateo Mountains (Socorro County, New Mexico)|identically named range]] in [[Socorro County, New Mexico|Socorro County]], south of this range.

The San Mateo Mountains are a volcanic range, formed by the eruption of Mount Taylor and its prehistoric ancestors.

Most of the San Mateo Mountains are within the Mount Taylor Ranger District of the [[Cibola National Forest]].  There is no designated [[wilderness area]] in the range.<ref name="butterfield_greene">Butterfield, Mike, and Greene, Peter, ''Mike Butterfield's Guide to the Mountains of New Mexico'', New Mexico Magazine Press, 2006, ISBN 978-0-937206-88-1</ref>
