==Biography==
===Personal life===
Christopher John Cheney<ref name="APRAXmas"/> was born on 2 January 1975 and grew up in [[Wheelers Hill, Victoria|Wheelers Hill]], an outer-eastern suburb of Melbourne.<ref name="Valentish"/> His father is Noel Cheney.<ref name="Horan"/> At the age of five-years-old he saw his first rock performance at [[Waverley Park|VFL Park]], which was close to his home <U+2013> it was a gig by United States stadium rockers, [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]].<ref name="Valentish"/> He attended Jells Park Primary School in between 1981 to 1987 and then [[Wheelers Hill Secondary College]]. He later studied [[Jazz]] at [[Box Hill Institute of TAFE]] between 1994 to 1995. Cheney started playing guitar at the age of six he taught himself how to play by listening to [[AC/DC]] cassette tapes over and over and practising what he heard. His major influence was [[Brian Setzer]] ([[Stray Cats]]), a [[guitarist]], [[singer-songwriter]].<ref name="Cheney"/>

On 22 September 2001, Cheney was injured in a car crash where his right leg was crushed and required a rod and three pins. He was initially confined to bed and later used a walking stick for the next six months. He was unable to play the guitar until he was rehabilitated. His future wife, Emma, was also inside the vehicle but escaped with minor injuries.<ref name="Reverb"/> Cheney married Emma in 2005, they have two daughters: Charlie Bella (born 2006) and Scarlett Lyric (born 2008). In October 2010 Chris and Emma, along with his manager Rae Harvey and her partner Woody Annison, opened their own recording studio, Red Door Studios.<ref name="Cashmere"/> On 25 April 2011 his father, Noel, died having been diagnosed with cancer the previous year.<ref name="Horan"/><ref name="Adams"/> Late that year the Cheneys moved to live in Los Angeles, "Both our littlies are in school here ... It's everyday life. You get up, mad rush in the morning, school drop-off, I come home, write a few songs, bum around and it's school pick-up again. It's life as we knew it, just in a different country".<ref name="Adams2"/>

===Music career===
Chris Cheney met [[Scott Owen]] at Jells Park Primary School and they began their career together in 1992, in a Melbourne band, The Runaway Boys, who took their name from a Stray Cats album, ''[[Runaway Boys]]'' <U+2013> which Cheney cites as one of his favourites.<ref name="Cheney"/> The group was a covers band playing Stray Cats and [[The Clash]] material.<ref name="Nimmervoll"/><ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="DVD"/> In 1992 the group's first paying gig was at the Richmond Club Hotel and they soon followed with a residency at the nearby [[Corner Hotel, Richmond|Corner Hotel]].<ref name="Valentish"/> The Runaway Boys had a succession of drummers, "The first two guys, Shane and Grant, were at high school with us and they were never really into '50s rock'n'roll. We were probably a bit pushy at that point. Grant was happy to play along, but then when high school finished he was ready to move on and go to university".<ref name="Valentish"/> Cheney also gigged on guitar in another band, Goodbye Sideburns Forever, though he was not recorded with them.<ref name="DVD"/>
