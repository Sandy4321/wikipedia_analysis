The earliest known sources that describe the existence of a merchant quarter on the bazaar's territory date back to the 12th century.<ref name="Macedonia National Tourism Portal">[http://www.exploringmacedonia.com/default.asp?ItemID=7F8C63EBC722BE42A26410EDD0DE8F9C Old Bazaaar - Skopje], Macedonia National Tourism Portal.</ref> During [[Ottoman Vardar Macedonia|Ottoman rule]] of Skopje, the Old Bazaar developed rapidly to become city's main centre of commerce. The Ottoman history of the bazaar is evidenced by roughly thirty [[mosque]]s, numerous [[caravanserai]]s and hans, among other buildings and monuments. The bazaar was heavily damaged by earthquakes that occurred in 1555 and 1963, as well as during the [[World War I|First]] and the [[World War II|Second World War]]s and faced various rebuildings following these events.

[[Ottoman architecture]] is predominant in the Old Bazaar, although remains of [[Byzantine architecture]] are evident as well, while recent reconstructions have led to the application of elements specific to [[modern architecture]]. Many of the historic buildings of the bazaar have been transformed into museums and galleries. It is, however, still home to several active mosques, [[t<U+00FC>rbe]]s, two churches and a clocktower, that, together with the buildings of the [[Museum of Macedonia]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art, Skopje|Museum of Modern Art]], form the core of the modern bazaar. 

On 13 October 2008, the [[Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian Parliament]] adopted a law recognising the Old Bazaar as cultural heritage of particular importance for the country to be permanently protected.<ref name="Bazaar law">[http://www.vecer.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=388D27026ECEC542ACA031FED5567095 <U+0421><U+043A><U+043E><U+043F><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430><U+0442><U+0430> <U+0447><U+0430><U+0440><U+0448><U+0438><U+0458><U+0430> <U+0434><U+043E><U+0431><U+0438> <U+0437><U+0430><U+0441><U+043B><U+0443><U+0436><U+0435><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0437><U+0430><U+0448><U+0442><U+0438><U+0442><U+0430>], ''[[Ve<U+010D>er (Macedonia)|Ve<U+010D>er]]'', 15 October 2008.</ref> In early 2010, the [[Government of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian Government]] began a project for the revitalisation of the Old Bazaar, which includes the restoration of several objects and aiming a further economic and cultural development of the site.<ref name="Rev programme">[http://www.dnevnik.com.mk/default-mk.asp?itemID=3A09BA95C0B1804BA63742A4B9927F98&arc=1 <U+041F><U+043E><U+0447><U+043D><U+0443><U+0432><U+0430> <U+0440><U+0435><U+0432><U+0438><U+0442><U+0430><U+043B><U+0438><U+0437><U+0430><U+0446><U+0438><U+0458><U+0430><U+0442><U+0430> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+043F><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430><U+0442><U+0430> <U+0447><U+0430><U+0440><U+0448><U+0438><U+0458><U+0430>], ''[[Dnevnik (Skopje)|Dnevnik]]'', 17 February 2010.</ref>

==History==

===Early period===
The earliest known archaeological findings revealed at the [[Kale Fortress]] testify that the surrounding area has been inhabited since 4,000 BC, while the earliest historical facts mention the [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonians]] as the first people who settled up on this area.<ref name="History">[http://staracarsija.mk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126&Itemid=84&lang=mk <U+0421><U+0442><U+0430><U+0440><U+0430> <U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+043F><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430> <U+0447><U+0430><U+0440><U+0448><U+0438><U+0458><U+0430>: <U+0418><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+0458><U+0430><U+0442>], ''sataracarsija.mk''.</ref>

Following the fall of the city of [[Scupi]] under Roman rule, numerous Roman buildings, such as [[Roman temple|temples]], [[thermae]]s, and [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatres]] were built inside the city, that subsequently promoted it as an important religious and cultural centre in the [[Roman Empire]].

In 518, Scupi was heavily damaged by a devastating earthquake, which prompted the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] to rebuild a new capital that was located distantly from the destroyed city.<ref>Dragojevi<U+0107> Josifovska, <U+201E>Inscriptions de la M<U+00E9>sie Sup<U+00E9>rieure (IMS)<U+201C>, vol. VI, Scupi et la r<U+00E9>gion de Kumanovo, Beograd, 1982.</ref> Nevertheless, the local population settled up on a hilly area, where, later, the emperor Justinian ordered the construction of the Kale Fortress.<ref name="History"/>

During the reign of king [[Samuel of Bulgaria|Samuel]], Skopje was given a particular strategic, political, economic, and cultural importance, so that the surrounding area of the Kale hill was embanked by the enactment of defensive walls, in order to keep the treasures that were present in the settlement. At the time, there was a gate named "Watertower Gate", which was built with the purpose to defend the city against the successive attacks by the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] in 1001.<ref>[http://www.ii.edu.mk/predmeti/mm/20052006/mmproekti/skopje_stara_charshija/istorijat-do-samuil.html <U+0418><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438> <U+043F><U+0440><U+0435><U+0433><U+043B><U+0435><U+0434> <U+043E><U+0434> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0458><U+0441><U+0442><U+0430><U+0440><U+043E> <U+0432><U+0440><U+0435><U+043C><U+0435> <U+0434><U+043E> <U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+043F><U+0430><U+0441><U+0442><U+0430> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+0421><U+0430><U+043C><U+043E><U+0438><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+043E><U+0442><U+043E> <U+0446><U+0430><U+0440><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+043E>], <U+041F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0435><U+043A><U+0442> <U+201E><U+0421><U+0442><U+0430><U+0440><U+0430> <U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+043F><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430> <U+0447><U+0430><U+0440><U+0448><U+0438><U+0458><U+0430><U+201C>.</ref>

=== Middle Ages ===

==== Byzantine rule ====
After the fall of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] under Byzantine rule in 1018, the emperor Basil II transformed Skopje into a capital of a [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] and an episcopal see, whose bishop was elected for a four-year term. Following the death of Basil, his successor, [[Romanos III Argyros]], undertook activities to reconstruct the [[Monastery of St. Georgi (Skopje)|Monastery of St. Georgi]], which, according to the deed of the Serbian king [[Stephen Uro<U+0161> II Milutin of Serbia]] from 1300, was situated on the hill called "Virgin", elevated on the bank of the river [[Serava]], the place where today the [[Sultan Murad Mosque]] is located. It is said that the monastery, at the time, was one of the most reputable and decorated monasteries in most of the [[Balkans]].<ref name="XI,XII">[http://www.ii.edu.mk/predmeti/mm/20052006/mmproekti/skopje_stara_charshija/istorijat-sreden-vek-1.html <U+041D><U+0430><U+0441><U+0442><U+0430><U+043D><U+0443><U+0432><U+0430><U+045A><U+0435> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+0447><U+0430><U+0440><U+0448><U+0438><U+0458><U+0430><U+0442><U+0430> <U+0432><U+043E> XI <U+0438> XII <U+0432><U+0435><U+043A>], <U+041F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0435><U+043A><U+0442> <U+201E><U+0421><U+0442><U+0430><U+0440><U+0430> <U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+043F><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430> <U+0447><U+0430><U+0440><U+0448><U+0438><U+0458><U+0430><U+201C>.</ref>

[[File:Ulaz u nekada<U+0161>nji bezistan u Skoplju.JPG|thumb|200px|Bezisten]]

===Bezisten===
Skopje's [[bezisten]], a covered market, was built in the 15th century by Gazi Ishak Bey, the [[Sultan]]'s Skopje regent. It was destroyed by a fire in 1689 and was later rebuilt. The bezisten has looked the same since its renovation in 1899.<ref name="culture.org.mk">http://www.culture.org.mk/eskopje%20frames.htm</ref>

===Clock tower===
Skopje's clock tower, built in the 16th century on the foundations of an older edifice, is located just north of the [[Sultan Murad Mosque]]. Originally built of wood, the top was replaced with bricks in 1902.<ref>[http://www.gomacedonia.com/clock_tower.shtml GoMacedonia]</ref>

The hexagonal tower was heavily damaged during the [[1963 Skopje earthquake|1963 earthquake]]. It was soon fully repaired.<ref name="culture.org.mk"/>

===<U+00C7>ifte Hamam===
{{main|<U+010C>ifte Hammam}}
[[File:National Artgallery of Republic of Macedonia (Skopje).JPG|thumb|left|200px|<U+00C7>ifte Hamam]]

The <U+00C7>ifte Hamam ([[Turkish language|Turkish]] for 'double bath'), located in the centre of the old bazaar, was built in the 15th century under Isa Bey. The building is divided into two wings (hence the name 'double'): one for men and one for women. The layout of both sections are nearly identical.<ref>[http://www.skopje.mk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=28&Itemid=21 skopje.mk]</ref>

The <U+00C7>ifte Hamam was used as a bathhouse until 1915. After suffering damages during the 1963 earthquake, it was repaired and has housed the Contemporary Art Gallery since then.<ref>[http://www.inyourpocket.com/macedonia/skopje/sightseeing/ottoman-skopje/cifte-hamam_29099v In Your Pocket]</ref>

===Daut Pa<U+015F>a Hamam===
Daut Pa<U+015F>a, Grand [[vizier|Vesir]] of East [[Rumelia]], constructed this [[Turkish bath|hamam]] in the 15th century. The building consists of fifteen rooms covered by thirteen domes. The two largest domes covered the two changing rooms and the rest of the domes covered individual bathing rooms.<ref>[http://www.inyourpocket.com/macedonia/skopje/sightseeing/ottoman-skopje/Daut-Pasha-Hamam-29114v In Your Pocket]</ref>

Since 1948, the Daut Pa<U+015F>a Hamam has housed the National Art Gallery.<ref name="culture.org.mk"/>

===Isa Bey Mosque===
[[File:Aladja Moschee01.JPG|thumb|160px|Ishak Bey Mosque]]

Situated on the outskirts of the bazaar, this mosque was built as a memorial for Isa Bey after his death. The mosque has two dominant domes and five smaller ones above the porch area.<ref name="culture.org.mk"/>

===Ishak Bey Mosque===
Also known as the Decorated (Aladya) Mosque because of the floral decorations, inscriptions and coloured tiles found on its walls, the Ishak Bey Mosque was constructed in 1438 in the northern part of the Old Bazaar. The mosque's minaret rises 30&nbsp;meters (98.4&nbsp;feet). There is a [[t<U+00FC>rbe]] located behind the mosque.<ref>[http://www.inyourpocket.com/macedonia/skopje/sightseeing/ottoman-skopje/Ishak-Bey-Mosque-29096v In Your Pocket]</ref>

===Kale Fortress===
{{main|Skopje Fortress}}

Located on the highest hill in Skopje, overlooking the city and the river, the area upon which the fortress was built was first inhabited in prehistoric times, according to archaeological findings.<ref name="skopje.mk">http://www.skopje.mk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=21</ref>

Most researchers believe that the fortress was first constructed in the 11th century.<ref name="skopje.mk"/>

===Kapan Han===
[[File:Kapan an.jpg|thumb|180px|Kapan Han]]
{{Main|Kapan Han}}
One of the three remaining caravanserais in the Old Bazaar, the Kapan Han was built in the 15th century. The rooms in the upper floor were available to guests, while the ground floor was used as a stable to house the guests' horses and cattle.<ref>[http://www.inyourpocket.com/macedonia/skopje/sightseeing/ottoman-skopje/Kapan-Han-29113v?all_chapters=1 In Your Pocket]</ref>

===Kur<U+015F>umli Han===
[[File:Kur<U+0161>umli han.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Kur<U+015F>umli Han]]

The largest of the three remaining caravanserais, the Kur<U+015F>umli Han ([[Turkish language|Turkish]] for 'Lead Inn') was built by Musein Odza, the son of a scientist at Sultan Selim II<U+2019>s court, in the 16th century.<ref>[http://www.skopje.mk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=27&Itemid=21 skopje.mk]</ref>

The roof of the inn was once covered in lead (hence the name), but was removed during World War I. The Kur<U+015F>umli Han also has several small pyramidically-shaped domes. The building has a ground floor, which housed the cattle and horses, and a first floor, which housed the guests.<ref name="culture.org.mk"/>

The attached mosque, built in the 17th century, and most of the hamam, built in the 15th century, were destroyed in the 1963 earthquake.

Today, the former han houses the statue collection of the [[Museum of Macedonia]].<ref>[http://www.inyourpocket.com/macedonia/skopje/sightseeing/ottoman-skopje/Kursumli-Han-29103v In Your Pocket]</ref>

===Mustafa Pa<U+015F>a Mosque===
{{main|Mustafa Pa<U+015F>a Mosque}}
The Mustafa Pa<U+015F>a Mosque, built in 1492 by Mustafa Pa<U+015F>a on an older Christian site,<ref>[http://www.gomacedonia.com/mustafa_pasha.shtml GoMacedonia]</ref> stands above the Old Bazaar, near [[Skopje Fortress|Kale Fortress]]. Considered one of the most elegant Islamic buildings in Macedonia, the complex includes the mosque, the tomb of Mustapha Pa<U+015F>a, the sarcophagus of one of his daughters, a fountain, and remnants of other buildings.

The mosque is square in shape and its largest dome is 16&nbsp;metres (52.5&nbsp;feet) in diameter. The porch is positioned on four marble pillars, decorated with stalactite, and covered by three small domes. The interior is decorated and includes calligraphic inscriptions. The minaret of Mustafa Pa<U+015F>a Mosque, rising 42&nbsp;metres (137.8&nbsp; feet)<ref>[http://www.inyourpocket.com/macedonia/skopje/sightseeing/ottoman-skopje/Mustafa-Pasha-Mosque_29095v In Your Pocket]</ref> is made of limestone.

Mustafa Pa<U+015F>a is buried in the hexagonal marble t<U+00FC>rbe covered by a dome above a short eight-sided [[tambour]]. Umi, one of his four daughters, is buried in the decorated sarcophagus which includes [[Persian language|Persian]] inscriptions on two of the four walls. The mosque courtyard is filled with roses and, due to its elevated location, offers a distinct view of the Old Bazaar.<ref name="culture.org.mk"/>

===Church of the Holy Salvation===

Constructed in the 16th century on the foundations of an older church,<ref>[http://www.soros.org.mk/konkurs/076/angver/crkva_svspas.html Soros]</ref> half of the church was built underground as it was illegal under Ottoman rule for Christian buildings to be taller than Islamic buildings so mosques could dominate the city skyline. The church got its present appearance in the 19th century.

The church's iconstasis was carved in wood and is 10 metres (32.8&nbsp;feet) long, 4.5 to 7 metres (14.8 to 23 feet) in height.<ref name="culture.org.mk"/>

Revolutionary [[Gotse Delchev|Goce Del<U+010D>ev]] is buried in a white stone sarcophagus in the church's courtyard.<ref>[http://www.exploringmacedonia.com/?ItemID=60170837F99D7A4AAF93A56C3D280825 Exploring Macedonia]</ref>

===Stone Bridge===
{{main|Stone Bridge (Skopje)}}

[[File:Puente de Piedra, Skopie, Macedonia, 2014-04-16, DD 91.JPG|thumb|250px|Stone Bridge at night]]
The Stone Bridge, across the [[Vardar|Vardar River]], connects the Old Bazaar to [[Macedonia Square]] in the new part of the city. The bridge, built in the 15th century under Sultan Murad, was built of stone blocks as its name suggests, which has helped it survive the fires and earthquakes Skopje has seen. The Stone Bridge has had the same appearance since it was first built.<ref name="culture.org.mk"/>

The bridge has 12 semicircular arches and is 214 metres (702&nbsp;feet) long. During Ottoman rule, countless executions were conducted on the Stone Bridge.<ref>[http://www.gomacedonia.com/stone_bridge.shtml GoMacedonia]</ref>

===Suli Han===
{{main|Suli An}}

The Suli Han was built under Ishak Bey in the 15th century. It has two floors with the upper having 54 rooms for the guests and the lower for the guests' cattle. It was fully repaired after sustaining heavy damaged during the 1963 earthquake.<ref>[http://www.skopje.mk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=29&Itemid=21 skopje.mk]</ref>

The han today houses the Skopje Academy of Art and the Old Bazaar Museum.<ref name="culture.org.mk"/>
