'''Valence''' ({{IPA-fr|va.l<U+0251><U+0303>s}}; [[Occitan language|Occitan]]: ''Valen<U+00E7>a'') is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in southeastern France, the capital of the [[Dr<U+00F4>me]] [[Departments of France|department]] and within the [[Rh<U+00F4>ne-Alpes]] [[Regions of France|region]]. It is situated on the left bank of the [[Rh<U+00F4>ne River|Rh<U+00F4>ne]], about {{convert|100|km|mi}} south of [[Lyon]], along the railway line that runs from Paris to [[Marseilles]].

It is the 5th largest city in the region by its population, with 62,481 registered inhabitants in 2012 (127,559 inhabitants in the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Unit<U+00E9> urbaine de Valence|Unit<U+00E9> urbaine de Valence|agglomeration}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau_local.asp?ref_id=POP&millesime=2011&typgeo=UU2010&typesearch=territoire&codgeo=UU2010+-+Valence+%2800651%29&territoire=OK|title=Insee - Population de l'unit<U+00E9> urbaine de Valence au recensement de 2011}}</ref> The city of Valence is divided into {{Interlanguage link|fr|List of cantons of Valence|Liste des cantons de Valence|four cantons}}.

Located in the heart of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Vall<U+00E9>e du Rh<U+00F4>ne (France)|Vall<U+00E9>e du Rh<U+00F4>ne (France)|Rhone corridor}}, Valence is often referred to as "the door to the [[Southern France|South of France]]", the local saying ''<U+00E0> Valence [[Southern France|le Midi]] commence'' ("at Valence the Midi begins")<!--unnecessary to cite quoted by H.C. Darby in ''The New Cambridge Modern History'' vol. ! 1957:23--> pays tribute to the city's southern culture. Between [[Vercors Massif|Vercors]] and [[Provence]], its geographical location attracts many tourists. Axes of transport and communications are the [[A7 autoroute|A7]] and [[A49 autoroute|A49]] autoroutes, the [[Route nationale 7|RN7]], [[Paris<U+2013>Marseille railway|Paris/Marseille TGV line]], as well as the [[Rh<U+00F4>ne]]. In addition, the Valence agglomeration is equipped with a {{Interlanguage link|fr|Port de l'<U+00C9>pervi<U+00E8>re|Port de l'<U+00C9>pervi<U+00E8>re|marina}}, a {{Interlanguage link|fr|Port fluvial de commerce de la Dr<U+00F4>me|Port fluvial de commerce de la Dr<U+00F4>me|trading port}}, two railway stations ([[Gare de Valence-Ville|Valence-Ville]] and [[Gare de Valence TGV|Valence-TGV]]) and an [[Valence-Chabeuil Airport|airport]]. Its business is essentially turned towards the sectors of [[Agribusiness|agriculture]], [[metallurgy]], [[Design engineer|engineering]] and [[electronics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/informations/economie-quand-valence-rime-avec-croissance_651920.html/|title=L'Express : Quand Valence rime avec croissance}}</ref>

The commune, founded in 121 BC, after the invasion of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], it moved quickly to become the largest crossroads of routes behind [[Lyon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museedevalence.fr/fr/musee/le-territoire|title=Mus<U+00E9>e de Valence : histoire}}</ref> With its growing importance, Valence gained the status of Roman colony. Over the centuries, the town grew and grew. Today, many vestiges of the [[Middle Ages]], [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]], but also from the 17th century, 18th century and 19th century are visible in the city centre. The city is historically attached to the [[Dauphin<U+00E9>]], of which it forms the second largest city after [[Grenoble]] and is today part of the network of [[French Towns and Lands of Art and History]]. Formerly the duchy of Valentinois, it was ruled by the [[Duke of Valentinois]], a title which is still claimed by the [[Sovereign Prince of Monaco]], though he has no actual administrative control over the area.

Valence has beautiful monuments such as the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Maison des T<U+00EA>tes de Valence|Maison des T<U+00EA>tes de Valence|Maison des T<U+00EA>tes}}, built between 1528 and 1532 by Antoine de Dorne, the [[Valence Cathedral|Saint-Apollinaire Cathedral]], built between 1063 and 1099 under the leadership of Bishop Gontard and also the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Fontaine monumentale|Fontaine monumentale|monumental fountain}} designed by the architect Eug<U+00E8>ne Poitoux. The city has many {{Interlanguage link|fr|List of historic monuments of Valence|Liste des monuments historiques de Valence|historical monuments}}, most of which are in {{Interlanguage link|fr|Vieux Valence}}. Inscribed on the list of flowery towns and villages of France, Valence is one of the seventeen municipalities of the Rh<U+00F4>ne-Alpes region to be labeled "four flowers" by the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Concours des villes et villages fleuris|Concours des villes et villages fleuris|''Concours des villes et villages fleuris''}}, i.e. the maximum level.

[[File:Map commune FR insee code 26362.png|thumb|left|Valence and the communes of its agglomeration]]

By its geographical location, Valence is one of the points of compulsory passage between [[Paris]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Its position at the centre of the meridian axis of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Vall<U+00E9>e du Rh<U+00F4>ne (France)|Vall<U+00E9>e du Rh<U+00F4>ne (France)|Rhone Valley}} places the city at the mouth of the Valley of the [[Is<U+00E8>re (river)|Is<U+00E8>re]] (path to the [[Alps]]), in the west of the historical province of [[Dauphin<U+00E9>]], within the natural and historic region of the [[Valentinois]], and the boundary of the department of [[Ard<U+00E8>che]] (which it is separated by the [[Rh<U+00F4>ne]]). The city is surrounded by several mountain ranges, including the [[Massif Central]] and the Ard<U+00E8>che hills to the west, and the [[Vercors Massif]] in the [[French Prealps]] to the east. Valence is {{convert|561|km}} to the southeast of [[Paris]], equidistant ({{convert|100|km}}) south of [[Lyon]] and southwest of [[Grenoble]], {{convert|120|km}} north of [[Avignon]], {{convert|220|km}} north of [[Marseille]], {{convert|204|km}} north of [[Montpellier]], {{convert|110|km}} south-west of [[Saint-<U+00C9>tienne]], {{convert|113|km}} to the east of [[Le Puy-en-Velay]], {{convert|50|km}} north of [[Mont<U+00E9>limar]], {{convert|40|km}} to the east of [[Privas]] and {{convert|65|km}} to the west of [[Die, Dr<U+00F4>me|Die]]. Located a few kilometres south of the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]], the city is often referred to as the "gateway to [[Southern France]]." ''"<U+00C0> Valence le Midi commence"'' [To Valence the Midi commences], say people from the north.

[[File:P1280096 - Valence.JPG|thumb|right|An aerial view of Valence]]
The agglomeration is based on four alluvial terraces ranging on the left bank of the Rhone:

*The lowest, which is closest to the river, where the districts of fishermen and sailors were.
*The intermediate terrace, safe from the floods of the river, which grew into the historic city, first within its walls, then expanded outside.
*The third terrace, highly urbanised in the second half of the 20th century.
*The highest, called the plateau of Lautagne which has developed as a centre of technological activities since the end of the 20th century on the edge of grain and vegetable farms.

Administratively, the commune is located in the south of the [[Rh<U+00F4>ne-Alpes]] region, in the northern half of the d<U+00E9>partement of [[Dr<U+00F4>me]] (of which it is the prefecture), and in the south-west of the [[Arrondissement of Valence]] (of which it is the capital). Moreover, Valence is the [[chef-lieu]] of four cantons, {{Interlanguage link|fr|Canton de Valence-1|Canton de Valence-1|Valence-1}}, {{Interlanguage link|fr|Canton de Valence-2|Canton de Valence-2|Valence-2}}, {{Interlanguage link|fr|Canton de Valence-3|Canton de Valence-3|Valence-3}} and {{Interlanguage link|fr|Canton de Valence-4|Canton de Valence-4|Valence-4}}, the city is therefore divided into four at the cantonal level . The commune is part of the {{interlanguage link|fr|Communaut<U+00E9> d'agglom<U+00E9>ration Valence-Romans Sud Rh<U+00F4>ne-Alpes}}, which includes 51 communes since its inception on 1 January 2014, and Valence is the most populous city. Valence was previously part of two intercommunalities: {{Interlanguage link|fr|Valence Agglo <U+2013> Sud Rh<U+00F4>ne-Alpes|Valence Agglo <U+2013> Sud Rh<U+00F4>ne-Alpes|SISAV}} (Intercommunal Union of Services of the Valentinoise Agglomeration, better known under the name of "Valence Major") which includes seven Dr<U+00F4>me and Ard<U+00E8>che communes (Bourg-l<U+00E8>s-Valence, Cornas, Guilherand-Granges, Portes-l<U+00E8>s-Valence, Saint-Marcel-l<U+00E8>s-Valence, Saint-P<U+00E9>ray and Valence) from 1990 to 2009, and of the agglomeration community of {{Interlanguage link|fr|Valence Agglo <U+2013> Sud Rh<U+00F4>ne-Alpes}} which consisted of eleven communes from 2009 to 2014.

===Relief and geology===

The area of the commune is {{convert|3669|ha|acre}}, representing {{convert|36.69|km2}}; the altitude varies between {{convert|106-191|m}}.<ref>[[Institut g<U+00E9>ographique national]], ''R<U+00E9>pertoire g<U+00E9>ographique des communes'', {{cite web|url=http://professionnels.ign.fr/rgc#tab-3|title=RGC<U+00AE> <U+00E9>dition 2014}}.</ref>

The granitic base, cut by the Rh<U+00F4>ne in the Saint-Vallier/Tain-l'Hermitage pass, is covered by {{convert|4000|m|ft}} of sediments in the Valence trough. In the [[Miocene]], a [[molasse]] formed of detrital rocks due to the erosion of the [[French Alps|Alps]] and the [[Massif Central]], was deposited in a shallow sea. Its thickness can reach {{convert|400-500|m}}. During the [[Pliocene]], the sea was reduced into a lake, resulting in lacustrine deposits and [[loess]] formation. During the [[Quaternary]], between glacial periods, [[moraine]]s were swept away by the meltwater in the interglacial stages and were carved by the rivers. Thus, nested terraces were formed. These nested terraces of Is<U+00E8>re and Rh<U+00F4>ne eventually filled the gap of Valence.

The Dr<U+00F4>me des Collines, which integrates Valence, formed at the end of the Miocene. Under the effect of the Alpine thrust, the area was covered by a lake and fluvio-lacustrine molasse formed with a few ripples in the plain of Valence. The confluence of the Is<U+00E8>re and Rh<U+00F4>ne and [[fluvial]] erosion caused by their waters, in the Quaternary, formed four superimposed terraces which are located in Valence.

===Hydrography===
Valence is watered by the [[Rh<U+00F4>ne]] river, the commune is on the left bank. One of its tributaries also crosses the city: The {{Interlanguage link|fr|<U+00C9>pervi<U+00E8>re (rivi<U+00E8>re)|<U+00C9>pervi<U+00E8>re (rivi<U+00E8>re)|<U+00C9>pervi<U+00E8>re}}, a {{convert|2.6|km}}-long river,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://services.sandre.eaufrance.fr/Courdo/Fiche/client/fiche_courdo.php?CdSandre=V4011060|title=l'<U+00E9>pervi<U+00E8>re sur le site du SANDRE}}</ref> formed by the joining of most of the city's channels, among others.

===Plain of Valence===
[[File:Unit<U+00E9>s de paysage du Valentinois.JPG|thumb|left|Landscape units of [[Valentinois]]]]

The city gave its name to a well-defined geographical region: The [[Valentinois]]. Over more than three-quarters of its territory, this region corresponds to the plain of Valence, shaped by successive beds of the [[Rh<U+00F4>ne]] which are abandoned fertile sedimentary deposits. Indeed, this plain, perfectly bounded by the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Vall<U+00E9>e du Rh<U+00F4>ne (France)|Vall<U+00E9>e du Rh<U+00F4>ne (France)|Rh<U+00F4>ne Valleys}} to the west, the [[Is<U+00E8>re (river)|Is<U+00E8>re]] in the north, and the [[Dr<U+00F4>me (river)|Drome]] to the south, gives the appearance of a cheerful orchard with [[peach]], [[Prunus armeniaca|apricot]] and [[cherry]] trees, alternating with cereal and vegetable crops. Large farms, conquered one by one by the inhabitants of Valence, punctuate this agricultural area, barely broken by rivers and canals for irrigation, with groves and woods on its margins.

To the east, the Monts du Matin extend as a long barrier of pleasant hills, dominated by the limestone prow of the Vercors. To the south, beyond the Dr<U+00F4>me Valley, the plain ends at the foot of the massif carrying the vast forest of [[Marsanne, Dr<U+00F4>me|Marsanne]], topped by wind turbines.

To the north, beyond the Is<U+00E8>re Valley, the Romanais continues, geologically, Valence plain. The lower [[Miocene]] molasse in the north of the plain was covered by outwash [[alluvium]] of the Is<U+00E8>re, whose terraces today still mark the shape of the Valentinois.

The view from the ruins of the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Crussol]], in front after the first sharp turns in the road on leaving the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Col des Limouches}}, the plain of Valence appears as it is, a large flat surface, bordered by two reliefs which are unobscured. It is also a very large area because the of the same formation of physical organisation, one of successive terraces. Only the habitat and crops bring variation, due to the different nature of these terraces.

Today the plain of Valence is organised around the Valence infrastructure whose urban sprawl gradually extends across its whole area. A number of communes however retain their village identity and their rural character, protecting them from changing into dormitory towns. These are ancient agricultural villages, especially those that precede the first villages on the side of [[Vercors Massif|Vercors]]. Their names evoke an initial high placement to readily give a defensive view of the plain of Valence: [[Mont<U+00E9>lier]], [[Montvendre]], [[Mont<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>ger]], [[Montoison]], [[Montmeyran]] and [[Beaumont-l<U+00E8>s-Valence]].

However, the territories corresponding to the plain of Valence and the Valentinois do not include west of the agglomeration, which is located in the neighbouring department of Ard<U+00E8>che.

===Climate===
[[File:Temp<U+00E9>ratures et pr<U+00E9>cipitations en Valentinois.JPG|thumb|right|Temperature and rainfall curves of Valence in 1990]]

Valence enjoys a [[temperate climate]], whose main characteristic is an almost constant wind which blows and dries the Rh<U+00F4>ne corridor. Dubbed the "[[Mistral (wind)|mistral]]" when it comes from the north, it brings good weather and coolness in the summer, but an impression of freezing cold in winter. When it comes from the south, it usually announces the arrival of stormy disturbances. It is then called ''le vent du midi ou le vent des fous'' [the midi wind or the uncaring wind] because, for some people, it makes the atmosphere painful to bear, especially in the summer.

The climate is semi-continental with [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] influences. The Gotheron weather station of [[Saint-Marcel-l<U+00E8>s-Valence]], located {{convert|6|km}} from the centre of Valence, recorded an average temperature of 12.3&nbsp;<U+00B0>C and {{convert|886|mm|in}} of precipitation over the period from 1966 to 2004. The annual sunshine in Valence is 2,500 hours/year (average 1970-1994). However, there are large variations from one year to another, depending on the dominant influence (in turn Mediterranean and semi-continental). During the period from 1994 to 2004, the following years were remarkable: Lack of sunshine in 1996 (1,712 hours), low precipitation ({{convert|572|mm|in}}) and high temperatures in 1997, significant rainfall in 1999 ({{convert|1049|mm|in}}) and in 2002 ({{convert|1257|mm|in}}). There was significant sunshine (approx. 2,500 hours) from 1999 to 2002, accompanied by higher than average temperatures. Frost in April 2003 which affected peach production, follwed by a summer heatwave in 2003, with exceptional sunshine for the year (2,781 hours), and a rainfall deficit in 2004 ({{convert|722|mm|in}}).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://orgprints.org/7699/1/AB_INRA_Gotheron_2006.pdf | title = Arboriculture biologique : 11 ann<U+00E9>es d<U+2019>exp<U+00E9>rimentation en vergers de p<U+00EA>chers et pommiers - R<U+00E9>sultats exp<U+00E9>rimentaux 1994-2004, Suivi longitudinal, Impact du mode de production |language=fr|trans-title=Organic Arboriculture : 11 years of experimentation in peach orchards and apple - Experimental Results 1994-2004 Longitudinal follow-up , mode of production Impact| publisher = INRA Gotheron, in partnership with Agribiodr<U+00F4>me and GRAB | date = March 2006}}</ref>

Valence is located in the Rh<U+00F4>ne Valley where the wind regime is regular, both from the south (mistral) and north. Adding in the course of the Rh<U+00F4>ne which is linear from Lyon to Valence, this circumstance has allowed navigable sailing on the Rh<U+00F4>ne from Valence.<ref>{{cite book|first=M.|last=Rossiaud|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/shmes_1261-9078_1978_act_7_1_1239|title=Les haleurs du Rh<U+00F4>ne au XVe siecle|work=Actes des congr<U+00E8>s de la Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> des historiens m<U+00E9>di<U+00E9>vistes de l'enseignement sup<U+00E9>rieur public, 7e congr<U+00E8>s|location=Rennes|year=1976|id=Les transports au Moyen <U+00C2>ge|page=286}}</ref>

===Vegetation===
The vegetation in the plain of Valence is mid-European with a supra-Mediterranean floor ([[Quercus robur|pedunculate oak]], oak found in the coldest places, and thickets of [[hornbeam]]) mingled with thermophilic species such as [[Quercus pubescens|downy oak]], or even [[Quercus ilex|evergreen oaks]] on exposed slopes with draining soils. Found also in the south of the Dr<U+00F4>me Valley where the Mediterranean influence finally prevails ({{convert|20|km}} to the South) are spontaneous populations of [[Thymus (plant)|thyme]], [[Lavandula|lavender]], [[Euphorbia characias]], Spanish broom ({{interlanguage link|fr|Genista hispanica}}), cane of Provence ([[Arundo donax]]), as well as [[Pinus halepensis|Aleppo pines]] on the western face of the massif of [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Crussol|Crussol]]. Due to the exposure and the nature of the soil, the Ard<U+00E8>che hills offer landscapes of [[garrigue]] and Mediterranean Oak (Quercus Ilex) from [[Tournon-sur-Rh<U+00F4>ne|Tournon]] which is located {{convert|22|km}} north of Valence (hills of [[Cornas]], [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Crussol]] and [[Soyons]]). The hills (mostly limestone) have a double vegetation: Mediterranean on the southern side and Sub-continental on the northern side.

Formerly, the cultivation of olive trees was previously on the well-exposed heights of Tain-l'Hermitage ({{convert|19|km}} to the north), but they were replaced by the culture of the vine at first, and then by that of apricot, peach and other fruit which are still very present in the region, even though more than {{convert|7000|ha|acre}} of fruit (mainly apricots, cherries, peaches and kiwis) disappeared from the Dr<U+00F4>me landscapes due to an outbreak of [[Plum pox|sharka]] and a [[Pathogenic bacteria|bacterial infection]] forcing wilt since 2003.

==Communication and transport==
The central railway station of Valence is the [[Gare de Valence-Ville]], located just south of the town centre. The station offers connections to Lyon, Grenoble, Avignon, Gap and several regional destinations. In 2001 the [[Gare de Valence TGV]] opened along with the [[LGV M<U+00E9>diterran<U+00E9>e]], a [[high-speed rail]] line extending south from Valence to [[Marseilles]]. The station is only {{Convert|1|km|mi|0}} south of the end of the [[LGV Rh<U+00F4>ne-Alpes]], giving Valence much shorter journey times to northern destinations as well, with a journey to Paris taking 2h11. The TGV station is located 10&nbsp;km northeast of the town.

A [[Bicycle sharing system|bikesharing]] scheme called Lib<U+00E9>lo started in March 2010, offering 200 bicycles for long-term hire and 180 for short-term hire, in 18 locations around the city. Charges are collected by smart card or credit card.<ref>{{Cite web

===Road network===
[[File:L'autouroute A7 <U+00E0> Valence.JPG|thumb|right||The A7 at the northern entrance to Valence, looking southbound.]]

The city occupies a key position, at the centre of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Rh<U+00F4>ne Valley (France)|Vall<U+00E9>e du Rh<U+00F4>ne (France)|Rh<U+00F4>ne Valley}}. Located on a crossroads of road networks, it is known to be a point of passage (cf. the Valence Autoroute Area) of the holidaymakers who head to the C<U+00F4>te d'Azur. The [[A7 autoroute]] (commonly known as the ''autoroute du soleil'' [motorway of the sun]) connects it to [[Lyon]] ({{convert|100|km}} to the north), [[Avignon]] ({{convert|120|km}} to the south), then to [[Marseille]] ({{convert|220|km}} south). The [[A49 autoroute]] connects it to [[Grenoble]] ({{convert|95|km}} to the northeast). The [[A41 autoroute]] connects it to [[Savoy]] ([[Chamb<U+00E9>ry]] and [[Annecy]]; {{convert|158|km}} and {{convert|206|km}} respectively) and [[Geneva]] (Switzerland) {{convert|245|km}} to the northeast (via the A49).

On the other hand, relations with the cities of the [[Massif Central]] ([[Le Puy-en-Velay]] and [[Clermont-Ferrand]]) are more difficult as the roads are very winding. For example, the shortest route to reach [[Saint-<U+00C9>tienne]] passes through the [[Col de la R<U+00E9>publique]] (ex-{{Interlanguage link|fr|Route nationale 82 (France)|Route nationale 82 (France)|RN 82}}) at {{convert|1161|m}} altitude.

====Underground project of the A7====
In Valence, the [[A7 autoroute]] runs along the [[Rh<U+00F4>ne]] and thus crosses the city by cutting the river. An underground project of the autoroute up to the city is being studied.<ref name="point2011">{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/.../une-ville-en-devenir-10-03-2011-1307671_27.php/|title=Le Point : Une ville en devenir}}</ref>

The city of Valence was cut off from its river during the construction of the A7 motorway in the 1960s. The idea is born to bury the fast axis semi-covered trenches over a distance of about {{convert|1.5|km}}. This project to bury the motorway should make the banks of the Rh<U+00F4>ne available to Valence. However, the project would not be completed prior to at least 2025. The studies, which will be soon carried out, should enable a decision on the exact length of motorway involved, the technical choices and the financial cost. According to a preliminary study, the construction costs should culminate in an amount of <U+20AC>500 million, of which the cost will be shared between the State, the company {{Interlanguage link|fr|Vinci Autoroutes}}, the department of Dr<U+00F4>me and the city of Valence.

====Valence ring road====
The p<U+00E9>riph<U+00E9>rique ([[ring road]]) of Valence consists of the A7 autoroute, [[Route nationale 7]] and the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Route nationale 532}}. It is located on the European routes [[European route E15|E15]] (A7) and [[European route E713|E713]] (RN 532).

Forming a half-loop, the Valence ring road covers a little more than {{convert|22|km}} and connects the commune of [[Bourg-l<U+00E8>s-Valence]] to the north (up to the toll of Valence Nord) in the city quarter of {{Interlanguage link|fr|Fontlozier}} to the south (to the toll of Valence Sud exit), thus bypassing the major part of the city whilst ensuring the city is served to the east. It also allows easy access to the [[Gare de Valence TGV|Valence TGV station]] in the north, by the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Route nationale 532|Route nationale 532|RN 532}}. The ring road of Valence features motorway except in two singular points. The portion of the [[A7 autoroute]] in the centre is the legacy of the 1960s when the city turned back to its river. It is even doubled by urban roads, the D2007N.

Plans to form a complete loop, connecting the current ring road to a western bypass of Valence, on the right bank of the [[Rh<U+00F4>ne]], are under consideration. The east ring road is of more recent design and it ensures the continuity of the RN 7, which offers a free alternative to the A7. This section also provides the extension of the [[A49 autoroute]] right to Valence. A road-doubling project of the A7 and A49 autoroutes was considered to relieve the ring road of its transit traffic but was abandoned, even though this axis was granted to the society of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Autoroutes du Sud de la France}} (ASF) and acquisitions had been completed.

The west bypass is gradually emerging and it relates directly to the department of [[Ard<U+00E8>che]]. It is materialised by a second bridge (L<U+00F4>nes Bridge) on the Rh<U+00F4>ne (D 96 and D 534) coming to relieve the Mistral Bridge located in the city centre. This bypass is to develop because it is located in the core trunk with the D86, the main axis of the right bank of the Rh<U+00F4>ne. The bypass of the communes of [[Guilherand-Granges]], [[Saint-P<U+00E9>ray]] and [[Cornas]] is programmed, which ensures its realisation by 2025. It will then require the construction of a third bridge over the Rh<U+00F4>ne in the north of the metropolitan area (in Bourg-l<U+00E8>s-Valence) to complete the ring road that will then form a complete loop: This project is at the stage of preliminary studies and it seems that a passage on the present dam of the [[Compagnie Nationale du Rh<U+00F4>ne|CNR]] is retained in order to minimise the cost.

===The bridges of Valence===
[[File:Valence pont cpa ll.jpg|thumb|right|The former stone bridge (around 1919), replaced in 1967 by the Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric-Mistral Bridge.]]

During antiquity, the existence of a bridge providing, as in [[Vienne, Is<U+00E8>re|Vienne]], the link between the two shores, is likely. Indeed, as early as 1388, the toponym "Pont P<U+00E9>ri" [P<U+00E9>ri Bridge] is carried by a sector of the quarter of Basse-Ville lying in the extension of the east-west axis of the ancient city. In addition, A. Blanc would have discovered, still in this same extension, piles of oak, closer perhaps to a pier. He also mentioned the "tour de Constance" [Constance Tower], on the Valence shore, a construction already known in the Middle Ages and which bore all the floods of the Rh<U+00F4>ne. In any case, the existence of a link between the two banks is in no doubt and a crossing point could even have existed at the site of Valence from the prehistoric time. Whether or not that existed, this ancient bridge was not replaced until the nineteenth century.

The different successive bridges of Valence, in chronological order, are:

*The [[Marc Seguin|Seguin]] Bridge built from 1827 (two years after that of [[Tain-l'Hermitage|Tain]]-[[Tournon-sur-Rh<U+00F4>ne|Tournon]], which was the first bridge of this type installed in France) and delivered to traffic in 1830.
*The stone bridge, dating from 1905, destroyed 19 June 1940 by French engineers to slow the advance of the German troops. In August 1940, Rhone is again passable by boat and then a ferry to traille. A temporary {{Interlanguage link|fr|Gaston Pigeaud|Gaston Pigeaud|Pigeaud}} bridge was then installed by the engineers. This bridge was again damaged on 18 August 1944 during a bombing by the Allied forces.
*A temporary suspended walkway installed in 1949 and which was in use until 1967.
*The [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Mistral]] Bridge, completed in 1967, is still in service. It joins the commune of [[Guilherand-Granges]] (Ard<U+00E8>che) to the city centre of Valence (Dr<U+00F4>me).
*Finally, the {{Interlanguage link|fr|L<U+00F4>ne|L<U+00F4>ne|L<U+00F4>nes}} Bridge was inaugurated on 18 December 2004, located at the south of the city, is the "second bridge" of Valence, long expected to alleviate the problems of movement between the two banks of the Rhone. It connects the municipalities of Guilherand-Granges and [[Soyons]] (Ard<U+00E8>che) in the southern districts of Valence.

During long periods where no bridge was available, a [[reaction ferry]] could cross the Rhone River. On the right bank, in Guilherand-Granges, an old pile used by this {{Interlanguage link|fr|bac|bac|ferry}} is still erect.

Commissioned in 1865, the role of the [[gare de Valence-Ville|Valence-Ville]] railway station has refocused on regional transport since the commissioning of the [[gare de Valence TGV]] or simply Valence-TGV. It is the point of departure of the trains in the direction of [[Grenoble]], [[Chamb<U+00E9>ry]], [[Annecy]] and [[Geneva]].

===Public transport===
{{main|{{Interlanguage link|fr|Public transport of Valence and Romans-sur-Is<U+00E8>re|Transports en commun de Valence et Romans-sur-Is<U+00E8>re|Cit<U+00E9>a}}}}

The region has a bus network called ''Cit<U+00E9>a'' which covers the Valence [[Urban agglomeration|agglomeration]] (located across the departments of [[Dr<U+00F4>me]] and [[Ard<U+00E8>che]]) and the [[Romans-sur-Is<U+00E8>re|romano]]-[[Bourg-de-P<U+00E9>age|peageoise]] town (about {{convert|20|km}} north of Valence). The network is managed by ''Valence Romans D<U+00E9>placements'' and controlled by the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Communaut<U+00E9> d'agglom<U+00E9>ration Valence-Romans Sud Rh<U+00F4>ne-Alpes}} and its operation is entrusted to VTV (''V<U+00E9>olia Transport Valence'') from 2012 (the former CTAV network to July 2006). Given the large extent of the Cit<U+00E9>a network, the latter is divided into two sectors, Valence and [[Romans-sur-Is<U+00E8>re]].

The territory covered by the network is {{convert|1037|km2}}. It consists of 64 communes located in and around the towns of Valence and Romans-sur-Is<U+00E8>re and is inhabited by nearly 220,000 people. Fourth urban network of the Rh<U+00F4>ne-Alpes region, it has 20 regular lines, over 200 stops and a fleet of 220 bus.

The {{Interlanguage link|fr|Carte O<U+00F9>RA!|Carte O<U+00F9>RA!|Oura! card}} is a transport document which consists of a smartcard which allows not only to travel on any Cit<U+00E9>a network (charging its transport tickets), but also to combine travel with other modes of transport in the region such as the [[TER Rh<U+00F4>ne-Alpes]] ([[Transport express r<U+00E9>gional]]), networks of transit of Saint Etienne ([[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> de Transports de l'Agglom<U+00E9>ration St<U+00E9>phanoise|STAS]]), Grenoble ({{Interlanguage link|fr|Transports de l'agglom<U+00E9>ration grenobloise|Transports de l'agglom<U+00E9>ration grenobloise|TAG}}) or Lyon ([[Transports en commun lyonnais|TCL]]), or even rent-a-bike in free service.

====Self-service bicycles====

{{main|Lib<U+00E9>lo}}
Since March 28, 2010, the city has a system of self-service [[Bicycle sharing system|rent-a-bike]] and long-term hire called [[Lib<U+00E9>lo]]. It includes 160 bikes on the [[Smoove]] key concept spread over 18 then 20 stations and 200 rental bikes for long duration in Valence, [[Guilherand-Granges]] and [[Bourg-l<U+00E8>s-Valence]].

Unlike most other bike sharing systems, its management is not delegated to a business, or related to an advertising market but provided by the transport company of Valence (subsidiary of [[Transdev]]) in partnership with the Cit<U+00E9>a transit network.

The airport has three runways: one of {{convert|2100|m|ft}} in concrete, and two smaller, {{convert|1300|m|ft}} and {{convert|440|m|ft}}. The {{convert|530|m2|sqft}} terminal has two gateways for access to aircraft. The aircraft parking area is {{convert|16000|m2|sqft}}. Passengers have at their disposal a 150-space car park and a hotel area.

[[Grenoble-Is<U+00E8>re Airport]] is located {{convert|80|km}} north-east of Valence along the A49 and offers flights to several European cities including Barcelona, Dublin, Rotterdam and Warsaw. [[Lyon-Saint-Exup<U+00E9>ry Airport]] is {{convert|114|km}} north of Valence via the A7 motorway and offers international flights. The airport is considered to be the second airport in the province after Nice-C<U+00F4>te d'Azur Airport and connects Lyon with most capitals and major European cities. More than 100 cities are connected one or more times a week, some up to five times per day, such as London. In 2013, the Lyon-Saint-Exup<U+00E9>ry airport processed more than 8.5 million passengers.

==Urban planning==

===Urban morphology===
The old centre is based on the Roman foundation on a [[grid plan]], occupation of the banks of the Rhone is sparse, probably because of instability.<ref>{{cite book|first1=G<U+00E9>rard|last1=Chouquer|first2=Thierry|last2=Odiot|first3=Alain|last3=Beeching|first4=Jacques L<U+00E9>opold|last4=Brochier|first5=Sylvio|last5=Matteucci|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/dha_0755-7256_1984_num_10_1_1632|title=L'<U+00E9>volution morphohistorique de la cit<U+00E9> de Valence|id=Dialogues d'histoire ancienne|volume=10|year=1984|page=369}}</ref> The orientation of the streets of the Roman city, orientation still quite widespread in the streets of the old town, is identical to those of the ancient [[cadastre]]s of the surrounding countryside. The grid plan follows a dual orientation, varying neighbourhoods, the dual orientation which corresponds to two modules of this plan: One of about 360 Roman feet ({{convert|107|m}}), the other 420 feet, which sometimes breaks down into 120 feet spacing. This second module describes the angle of the ''Rue l<U+2019><U+00C9>querre'';  {{interlanguage link|fr|Place des Ormeaux}} exactly a square ''actus'' (i.e. a square with a side of 120 Roman feet); the [[Valence Cathedral|Saint-Apollinaire Cathedral]] occupies two square ''actus''.<ref name="chouquer-odiot-370">Chouquer, Odiot, opcit, p.370</ref> The presence of the Roman [[amphitheatre]] near the Porte Neuve [New Gate] is detectable only in the design of the streets of the cadastre from 1807.<ref name="chouquer-odiot-371">Chouquer, Odiot, opcit, p.371</ref>

The first alluvial terrace, at {{convert|120-125|m}} altitude, was fully occupied by the western part of the communal territory in the 1960s. The city of Valence then expanded eastward, on the [[Riss glaciation|Riss]] terrace, at an altitude of approximately {{convert|150|m}}. To the south, the Lautagne plateau, at an altitude of {{convert|180|m}}, determines a narrow groove between this advance from the terrace of la L<U+00E9>ore and the Rh<U+00F4>ne, which has limited the development of the city in that direction. At the end of the 20th century, the city was again cut off from the Rh<U+00F4>ne by the construction of the [[A7 autoroute]].<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Pierre|last1=Dubesset|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/geoca_0035-113x_1974_num_49_3_1655|title=Perspectives actuelles de l'am<U+00E9>nagement urbain <U+00E0> Valence-sur-Rh<U+00F4>ne|id=Revue de g<U+00E9>ographie de Lyon|volume=49|issue=3|year=1974|page=286}}</ref> Port areas are alone in the south towards [[Portes-l<U+00E8>s-Valence]].<ref>RG 287</ref> The Valence agglomeration stretches on the right bank of the Rh<U+00F4>ne, but is limited by the edge of the Vivarais plateau.

===Quarters===
{{main|{{Interlanguage link|fr|Quarters of Valence|Quartiers de Valence}}}}
[[File:Vue de Valence dans la Dr<U+00F4>me depuis le plateau de Lautagne.jpg|thumb|centre|750px||View of the southern districts of Valence from the plateau of Lautagne]]

The city of Valence is made of twenty [[Quarter (urban subdivision)|quarter]]s (with an average of 3,500 people per quarter). They are all different from the other: The northern quarters are rather popular and residential (Polygone, Fontbarlettes, le Plan and la Chamberli<U+00E8>re) and even rural (Thodure), while the southern quarters are generally inhabited by the middle class and pensioners ({{Interlanguage link|fr|Fontlozier}}, Hugo-Provence, Laprat, les Baumes, Mannet, Valence Sud and Lautagne), although there is a popular district (Valensolles), the central quarters are commercial and animated (Centre-ville, Gare, Victor Hugo) and also for tourists during the summer ({{Interlanguage link|fr|Vieux Valence}}, Basse ville, l'<U+00C9>pervi<U+00E8>re) and the east quarters are areas with residential character (Baquet, Grand Charran, Petit Charran, Ch<U+00E2>teauvert, Danton and Briffaut), however the Martins quarter is rather rural.

Some districts are represented by a {{Interlanguage link|fr|Comit<U+00E9> de quartier|Comit<U+00E9> de quartier|"Quarter Committee"}}, which makes for a very lively micro-local fabric. A Quarter Committee is an association of people who play a role with regard to public institutions, and who allow an exchange of information between people and municipal services. In this way, residents can participate in the direction of development projects of their quarters according to their aspirations.

To avoid a trip to the city hall, the city of Valence has created five city hall branches in outlying quarters. The mayoral branches of Fontbarlettes, le Plan, Centre-Ville, Valence Sud and the Chamberli<U+00E8>re are placed at the disposal of the inhabitants and are in charge of certain administrative services delegated by the Central Council.

===Housing===
In 2009, the total number of dwellings in the municipality was 34,661, while it was 32,376 in 1999.<ref>''LOG T1M - <U+00C9>volution of the number of houses by category.</ref>

Among this housing, 88.4% were primary residences, 1.0% of secondary residences and 10.6% vacant housing. These dwellings were 24.1% detached houses and 74.7% of apartments.<ref name="LOG T2">''LOG T2 - Categories and types of housing.</ref>

The proportion of primary residences, as properties of their occupants, was 43.1%, up slightly from 1999 (41.1%). The share of social housing (empty rented [[HLM]]) was 16.5% against 18.8%, their number having dropped: 5,059 against 5,439.<ref>''LOG T7 - Main residences by occupancy status.</ref>

Concerning social housing, there are several organisations which are the Public Housing Office of Valence (OPH) and Housing Development of Dr<U+00F4>me (DAH) who construct, maintain and manage social housing throughout the city and in the Valence agglomeration,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dromeamenagementhabitat.fr/espace-collectivites-locales/|title=Dr<U+00F4>me Am<U+00E9>nagement Habitat (DAH)}}</ref> most are located in so-called working-class quarters. As for the grants of the OPH, they come from the city of Valence, the Dr<U+00F4>me department, the region and the State.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drome-hebdo.fr/blog/2011/02/28/du-negatif-au-positif/|title=Dr<U+00F4>me-Hebdo : Logements sociaux <U+00E0> Valence}}</ref> Those of DAH come mainly from the department.

===Development projects===
The major projects of the municipality do not yet concern the city centre, even if they have the merit of addressing the three terraces which line the city: the first terrace concerns Valence-le-Haut (quarters of le Plan and Fontbarlettes), the second concerns the centre and the south, and the third the banks of the [[Rh<U+00F4>ne]].

One of the city's major projects is the reclamation of the banks, disfigured by the passage of the A7 motorway over {{convert|1.4|km}}.<ref name="point2011" /> When he was Mayor of Valence, Member of Parliament [[Patrick Labaune]] had defended a bypass with an eastern route. Thus advocating the "removal the A7", when elected, specifically a burial of the motorway in semi-covered trenches. The project would have been validated by the company of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Autoroutes du Sud de la France}} (ASF), but the mayor refuses for now to give a price, which would be some <U+20AC>500 million according to experts.<ref name="point2011" /><ref name="calameo">{{cite web|url=http://www.calameo.com/books/000021831a9e850c22d0e/|title=Grands projets de ville}}</ref>

Other projects will be launched to create a {{convert|24|km}} [[Greenway (landscape)|green route]], on the banks, through the municipalities of Valence and [[Bourg-l<U+00E8>s-Valence]]. In addition to a renovation of the tourist facilities on the site of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Port de l'<U+00C9>pervi<U+00E8>re|Port de l'<U+00C9>pervi<U+00E8>re|l'<U+00C9>pervi<U+00E8>re}}, the city wants to transform the <U+00EE>les quarter into an [[Ecodistrict|ecoquarter]], with positive energy housing.<ref name="point2011" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drome-hebdo.fr/.../une-nouvelle-dynamique-pour-le-port/|title=Une nouvelle dynamique pour le port}}</ref> This project could lead to the removal of family gardens there. However, there is a building plot and the gardens will be resettled on fertile lands of the plateau of Lautagne.

Like the <U+00EE>les quarter, a new quarter is planned in the south of the city on the brownfield site of the Hugo-Provence area, in place of the former Cime building (destroyed in 2013), with the construction of 200 housing units (half social, half private), shops and a hotel.<ref name="calameo" /> The first part should be delivered before 2015.<ref name="point2011" />

One of the major issues of the municipality is the opening up of the Hauts-de-Valence, which is subject to a program of [[urban renewal]] of <U+20AC>117 million, jointly funded by the city and the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Agence nationale pour la r<U+00E9>novation urbaine|Agence nationale pour la r<U+00E9>novation urbaine|National Agency for urban renewal}} (ANRU). It includes the demolition of 417 houses in the working-class districts of the Plan and Fontbarlettes and their reconstruction by the end of 2014 throughout the city.<ref name="point2011" /> The project also includes an opening up and connection of these areas to the rest of the city. Shared public spaces will be created on Roosevelt and Kennedy boulevards.

At an estimated <U+20AC>100 million cost,<ref name="point2011" /> the last big project supported by the city concerns the creation of a city of sports and culture on the former military wasteland of Latour-Maubourg. It will host the new Jean-Pommier pool, a municipal exhibition hall, a media hub with the headquarters of the radio station {{Interlanguage link|fr|France Bleu Dr<U+00F4>me Ard<U+00E8>che}} and the ''[[Le Dauphin<U+00E9> lib<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>]]'' newspaper, and finally a centre of higher education. The renovated buildings will house a students' halls, Maestris private school, nursing school and the {{Interlanguage link|fr|<U+00C9>cole sup<U+00E9>rieure d'art et design de Valence|<U+00C9>cole sup<U+00E9>rieure d'art et design de Valence|regional school of fine arts of Valence}}, which has created a public establishment of cultural co-operation with that of Grenoble. In addition to the space of the wasteland, the city will have the land released by the relocation of the prison, in 2015. It has also launched a study to establish a new [[Convention center|palais des congr<U+00E8>s]] in the area.<ref name="point2011" />

==History==
{{main|Valentinois}}

The [[demonym]] corresponding to Valence is ''Valentinois'', but {{Interlanguage link|Valentinois|Valentinois|"Valentinois"}} also designates a geographical area, and one of the old [[provinces of France]], with its capital Valence having been part of the province of [[Dauphin<U+00E9>]].

[[File:Valence-MaisonT<U+00EA>tes-facade.jpg|thumb|left|The {{Interlanguage link|fr|Maison des T<U+00EA>tes de Valence|Maison des T<U+00EA>tes de Valence|''Maison des T<U+00EA>tes''}}]]

The word ''valence'' comes from Latin ''valentia'', meaning "strength or capacity". Known in Roman times as ''Valentia Julia'', the city had been the capital of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Segovellaunes|Segovellaunes|Segalauni}}, and the seat of a celebrated school prior to the Roman conquest. It became a colony under [[Augustus]], and was an important town of [[Viennensis Prima]] under [[Valentinian I]]. It was the seat of a [[Diocese|bishopric]] perhaps as early as the 4th century.

In the 5th century, control of Valentia passed from the Romans to the [[Alans]] and other [[barbarians]]: in 413, the [[Goths]] under [[Ataulf]] besieged and captured the brother of the usurper [[Jovinus]], [[Sebastianus]], at Valentia on behalf of the emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]]. In 440, [[Alans]] led by [[Sambida]] were given deserted lands in Valentia by the Romans.<ref>[[Chronica Gallica of 452]], Pith. 124</ref> Three years later, [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]] settled the [[Burgundians]] in the region, which became part of their kingdom until 534. The city then fell successively under the power of the [[Franks]], the Arabs of Spain, the sovereigns of [[Arles]], the emperors of Germany, the [[counts of Valentinois]], the [[counts of Toulouse]], as well as its own bishops, who struggled to retain the control of the city they had won in the fifth century. These bishops were often in conflict with the citizens and the counts of [[Valentinois]] and to strengthen their hands against the latter the pope in 1275 united their bishopric with that of [[Die, Dr<U+00F4>me|Die]].

The citizens put themselves under the protection of the [[Dauphin of France|dauphin]], and in 1456 had their rights and privileges confirmed by [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] and put on an equal footing with those of the rest of [[Dauphin<U+00E9>]], the bishops consenting to recognize the suzerainty of the dauphin. In the 16th century Valence became the centre of Protestantism for the province in 1563. The town was fortified by [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]]. It became the seat of a celebrated university in the middle of the 15th century; but the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1685 struck a fatal blow at its industry, commerce and population.

===Toponymy===
The conquest of [[Gaul]] by [[Julius Caesar]] made the Rh<U+00F4>ne corridor a major north-south communication axis, linking with the new Roman possessions around the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Many settlements were founded, including ''Valentia'', a Latin name meaning ''La Vaillante'' [brave], ''La Vigoureuse'' [strong], in the territory of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Segovellaunes}}.

The town named ''Valen<U+00E7>a'' in [[Occitan language|Occitan]], ''Val<U+00E8>n<U+00E7>o'' in literary [[Franco-Proven<U+00E7>al language|Proven<U+00E7>al]] and ''Valin<U+00E7>o'' in local Proven<U+00E7>al.

===Heraldry===

===Antiquity===

====At the end of prehistory====
[[File:Carte allobrogie.PNG|thumb|right|Territory of the [[Allobroges]].]]
The city of [[Marseille|Massalia]], long on good terms with Rome, asked it for help against the [[Salyes]] who had ravaged its territory. The intervention of the Romans, from 125 BC, assured its safety but the war continued against the [[Allobroges]], among whom the Salyes people had found refuge. In August 121 BC, the army of [[Fabius Maximus]] crushed them at the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Battle of the Confluence|Bataille du confluent}} (implied, the [[Rh<U+00F4>ne]] and [[Is<U+00E8>re (river)|Is<U+00E8>re]]) according to [[Strabo]] (''[[Geographica]]'', IV, 1, 11).{{cn|date=May 2015}}

[[Orosius]] noted that [[Gaius Marius]], who was sent by Rome to stop the [[Cimbri]] and the [[Teutons]], had established his camp not far from the confluence of the Rh<U+00F4>ne and the Is<U+00E8>re.<ref>Orose, ''Histoires'', V, 16, 9-10</ref> The excavations on the upper part of the plateau of Lautagne ({{convert|2.5|km}} south of the centre of Valence) revealed the presence of devices of a defensive nature dating from the 1st century BC: Thus the foundation of the city could have come from a Roman military camp.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

Even under the Roman domination, the Allobroges tribe established themselves north of Is<U+00E8>re, and repeatedly rebelled against the Roman occupation. The {{Interlanguage link|fr|Battle of Solonion|Bataille de Solonion}} was the last to take place, identifiable with the modern commune of [[Soyons]] (''Solo'' by Livy, Epitome 103) in 62 BC.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

====The selection of the site====
The city of ''Valentia'' was established on a terrace on the left bank of the [[Rh<U+00F4>ne]] river, {{convert|5|km}} south of the [[confluence]] of the [[Is<U+00E8>re (river)|Is<U+00E8>re]] and {{convert|15|km}} from the [[Dr<U+00F4>me (river)|Dr<U+00F4>me]].

This geographical situation is understood by the crossing of several routes of transport and communications:

*''Valentia'' had a privileged place in north-south trade through the Rh<U+00F4>ne and at the ''[[Via Agrippa]]''.
*''Valentia'' was part of east-west routes since the different paths, which traversed the plain from the Is<U+00E8>re Valley and the Dr<U+00F4>me ({{Interlanguage link|fr|Voie des Alpes}}), converged on the city. The ''Rh<U+00F4>ne'' was crossed at Valence on a ferry, by [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] or over a bridge.

====The ancient city====
The city of Valence, as many [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] cities, received an orthonormal plan. The orientation of the urban streets network successively followed cadastres "A" inclined N, 12<U+00B0>30'E and "B", inclined N, 23<U+00B0>E, in the Valence plain.<ref name="chouquer-odiot-370"/>

We know the ''[[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]]'' of the city thanks to the discovery of a pavement and a sewer a few metres north of the city hall. The ''[[cardo]]'' of the urban network was the ''[[Via Agrippa]]'' that crossed the city in a straight line from the southern gate of the city to the old gate and Tower of Aion, north of the city, which later became "Tourdeon" (now destroyed).{{cn|date=May 2015}}

It was along the ''Via Agrippa'' that a ''[[Forum (Roman)|forum]]'' was located, probably surrounded by a {{Interlanguage link|fr|civil basilica|Basilique civile|''civil basilica''}}, ''[[curia]]'', a ''[[Roman temple|temple]]'', etc., of which the location is unknown.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

To the south of the presumed forum site, between the ''Rue du Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre'' and ''Rue Vernoux'' the ruins of the ''[[thermae]]'' were discovered. This thermal water supply, and more generally that of the city of ''Valentia'', was thanks to the numerous springs in the vicinity. The site of Valence still presents a dense network of streams and canals born of the overflow of water which escapes in sources at the foot of the terraces, forming, in the east, a curved line from the source of the Treuil up to the Fountain of Malcontents, and near the Rh<U+00F4>ne and the lower town, a quasi-parallel line to the river from the Saint-Pierre source until the descent of the ''Boulevard Gambetta''. Thus, the Chony quarter (in the current commune of [[Bourg-l<U+00E8>s-Valence]]), were found remains of pipes that belonged to the aqueduct that brought water from the source of the Treuil to Valence.

[[File:Evocation de la porte Sud de Valentia.jpg|thumb|right|Evocation of the southern gateway to the city of ''Valentia'' under the early Roman Empire.]]

All around the current [[cathedral]] were discovered fragments of architecture probably belonging to a large [[temple]].

The city had entertainment facilities:

*A [[circus (building)|circus]] whose memory would be preserved in the name of the Cire quarter (<U+00AB>Siry<U+00BB> in the Middle Ages).{{cn|date=May 2015}}
*An [[amphitheatre]], was on the edge of the Rh<U+00F4>ne,{{cn|date=May 2015}} outside of the enclosure{{which|date=May 2015}} or near the New Gate.<ref name="chouquer-odiot-371"/>
*A C<U+00F4>te Sainte-Ursule [[theatre]]: Three surveys have revealed the orchestra, traces of large markets and large wall elements.{{cn|date=May 2015}} It was located at the northern edge of the city.<ref name="chouquer-odiot-371"/>
*An [[Odeon (building)|odeon]] whose curvature would be materialized by the ''Rue du Croissant''.<ref name="chouquer-odiot-371"/> In fact, the foundations of an odeon were found during the construction of the new museum, in the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Place des Ormeaux}} and its outline is materialised on the ground at the entrance to the museum.

The city was surrounded by [[Curtain wall (fortification)|ramparts]] from the early [[Roman Empire]]. This house would put in place between 15 BC and 15 AD. In 1869, excavations to the south of the old town revealed the existence of a monumental gate defended by two protruding towers. The fa<U+00E7>ade, or at least the pillars which were observed during the excavation, was covered with a large piece of sandstone and adorned with a frieze of military trophies: Shields, leggings and reastplates.

Houses settled around the city, outside the city walls.
*To the east of the city of ''Valentia'', not far from the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Voie des Alpes}} (in the direction of [[Die, Dr<U+00F4>me|Die]] and [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]]), in the current ''Rue Faventines''.
*To the west, in the Nonniers quarter, in the commune of [[Guilherand-Granges]] (right bank of the Rh<U+00F4>ne, facing Valence): A bridge or a ferry connecting the banks of the river.

The ancient port was perhaps on the territory of the current commune of Bourg-les-Valence.

Numerous tombs were crowded at the exit of the city, along the tracks: Several burial grounds were discovered in the east and south of the ancient city.

====Late antiquity====
During the first centuries of the Christian era, Valence became an important road junction on maps and routes, and the late [[Roman Empire]], this city retained its privileged position.

However, as early as the 4th century, ''Valentia'' faced many raids but the city stayed, inside its ramparts, with its monumental adornment competing, according to [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (''Histoires'', XV, 11, 14), with [[Arles]] and [[Vienne, Is<U+00E8>re|Vienne]].

At the dawn of the 5th century, the city lived in shelter of the ramparts erected under the late Roman Empire (still a visible construction in the 19th century). The [[Visigoths]] seized Valence in 413 AD; the [[Burgundians]] were masters of the Rh<U+00F4>ne basin at the end of the 5th century; the Valence people fell to the [[Franks|Frankish]] Kingdom in 533 AD. These successive [[Migration Period|invasions]] removed almost all traces of Romanisation.

During this troubled period, the city converted at best its ancient walls: Roman gates were bricked up, thus doing away with the two main axes of the city and lasting restructuring of the urban network. The rural inhabitants settled on small hills of the plain, giving rise to a large number of villages: [[Montoison]], [[Montmeyran]], [[Mont<U+00E9>lier]], [[Montvendre]], [[Mont<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>ger]], etc.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Valence-PorteStRuf.jpg|thumb|right|The old gate of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Abbaye Saint-Ruf de Valence|Abbaye Saint-Ruf de Valence|Saint-Ruf Abbey}}.]]

Around 800, a new Cathedral of Saint-Est<U+00E8>ve (of St. Stephen) was built instead of the [[baptistery]], with a [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] that was oriented to the west. It was constructed symmetrically to the Evangelist Church. It housed numerous relics: Those of saints Apollinaire, Cyprien, Corneille, F<U+00E9>lix, Fortunat, Achill<U+00E9>e and a fragment of the [[True Cross]]. The episcopal district also included housing for the canons, grouped around a court cemetery, and a round church, Notre-Dame-la-Ronde.<ref name="ed96-37">Christian Frachette, <U+00AB> Valence au dixi<U+00E8>me si<U+00E8>cle (879-1029) <U+00BB>, ''<U+00C9>tudes dr<U+00F4>moises'', no.96, d<U+00E9>cembre 1998, p.37.</ref> At the beginning of the 9th century, perhaps before, the Roman wall was raised with walls constructed from [[pebble]]s.<ref>Frachette, opcit, p.37-38.</ref> In 890, the widow of King [[Boso of Provence]] had their son, [[Louis the Blind|Louis III]], crowned King of Provence in Valence.<ref name="ed96-34">Frachette, op. cit., p.34.</ref>

In 1029, the {{Interlanguage link|fr|List of archbishops of Vienne (Is<U+00E8>re)|Liste des archev<U+00EA>ques de Vienne (Is<U+00E8>re)|Archbishop of Vienne}} invested {{interlanguage link|fr|Guigues III de Forez|Guigues III de Forez|Guigues III}} "the Old" of the County of Viennois.<ref name="ed96-34"/> It belonged to the family of the Counts of Albon, which held the region for decades, frequently occupying the county and the {{Interlanguage link|fr|List of bishops of Valence|Liste des <U+00E9>v<U+00EA>ques de Valence|Diocese of Valence}}.<ref name="ed96-35">Frachette, opcit, p.35.</ref> The region still suffered the raids of the [[Saracen]]s at the end of the 9th and the 10th century.<ref>Frachette, opcit, p.35 and 37.</ref>

The Rh<U+00F4>ne was sometimes presented as the border between the Kingdom of France and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] which made Valence part, until the 15th century, but it was especially a link between the countries bordering it. The Diocese of Valence, as the rival principality, the County of Valentinois and Diois, extended on both sides. It was also an important commercial axis, especially for salt, which would benefit the city which guards traces of the name of Rue "Sauni<U+00E8>re", formerly the name of one of the four gates of Valence, the one which gave access to the south.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valence.fr/fr/culture/2000-ans-dhistoire/|title=Valence: 2000 ans d'histoire}}</ref> The city also benefitted from its position at a point of change in the regime of winds in the Rh<U+00F4>ne Valley: In the Middle Ages, vessels ascended the river only by being hauled to the col, by sweat (by men). North of Valence, the rise could be done under sail (but not always). At the end of the 15th century, it was even the capital of hauling along the [[towpath]], because beside this advantage due to the wind, it was a one-day stop from Lyon, and a crossroads into the mountains. Finally, the rise of the Rh<U+00F4>ne was particularly difficult at Valence, which caused forced stops. Several Valentinois were specialised in the brokerage of haulers.<ref>Rossiaud, opcit, p.290.</ref> The haulers pulled either a big boat or boat trains, with teams from a few dozen to several hundred men. Each man drew a mass of about a ton.<ref>Rossiaud, opcit, p.287.</ref> This mode of hauling regressed at the end of the 15th century, to be replaced by hauling by horses, except for local hauling.<ref>Rossiaud, opcit, p.296.</ref>

[[File:Cath<U+00E9>drale de Valence - 2014-09-28- P1940386-P1940389.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Valence Cathedral|Saint-Apollinaire Cathedral]], seen from the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Place des Ormeaux}} in {{Interlanguage link|fr|Vieux Valence}}.]]

The city, safe from the flooding of the river and protected by its ramparts, was a step on the road for pilgrimages to [[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]]. Religious life flourished, the [[Valence Cathedral|Saint-Apollinaire Cathedral]] was built as well as the Abbey of the canons of {{Interlanguage link|fr|Abbaye Saint-Ruf de Valence|Abbaye Saint-Ruf de Valence|Saint-Ruf}}. Two major characters vied for power over the city: The Bishop and the [[Duke of Valentinois|Count of Valentinois]].

Economic growth translated into the development of towns, especially on the side of the Rh<U+00F4>ne: The Rivi<U+00E8>re (Riperia) said today, less poetically, as "Basse-Ville". The new city, north of the former Pomperi gate and Bourg-Saint-Pierre, formed around the Abbey of Saint-Pierre, which spawned the current commune of [[Bourg-l<U+00E8>s-Valence]]. Elsewhere, on the middle terrace, habitat outside-the-walls was associated with religious foundations: The commandery of the Hospitallers, the Tourdeon gate, the Abbey of Saint-F<U+00E9>lix, the Saint-Sulpice gate, the Faventines Templar Commandery, the Benedictine Priory of Saint-Victor in the south near the former ''[[Via Agrippa]]'' and, perhaps, further to the south, a [[Leper colony|leprosarium]] whose memory is retained through the channel of la Maladi<U+00E8>re.

After the disappearance of the County of {{Interlanguage link|fr|Valentinois}}, incorporated into the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Province of Dauphin<U+00E9>|Province du Dauphin<U+00E9>}}, the dauphin {{Interlanguage link|fr|Louis II de Poitiers-Valentinois}} may have imposed homage to the Bishop and Abbot of Saint-Ruf (free Abbot and immuniste): Valence was therefore incorporated into the province of Dauphin<U+00E9>. On the death of Louis II, who was the last count, the Valentinois was sold in 1419 by his heirs, his daughter Louise de Poitiers (widow of {{Interlanguage link|fr|Humbert VII de Thoire}} and Villars) and close relatives to Charles, dauphin and King of France ([[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]]). The County of Valentinois was attached to the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Crown of France|Couronne de France}} in 1424.

[[File:LL 24 - VALENCE - La Gare.jpg|thumb|right|The city was connected to the railway in 1854. [[gare de Valence-Ville|Valence-Ville Station]] is shown here with the statue of {{Interlanguage link|fr|Fran<U+00E7>ois-D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9> Bancel|Fran<U+00E7>ois-D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9> Bancel|Bancel}}, in the 1920s.]]

The second half of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th century were a golden age for the medieval city, materialised by the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Maison des T<U+00EA>tes de Valence|Maison des T<U+00EA>tes de Valence|Maison des T<U+00EA>tes}} and the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Pendentif de Valence}}. Founded on 26 July 1452 by the dauphin Louis, future [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]], the University of Valence grew quickly. Renowned professors from various countries, as [[Jacques Cujas]] forged its reputation by teaching the law, theology, medicine and arts. After his coronation, Louis XI confirmed its preference by mailing the letters patent for the university on 12 October 1461.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=4-ZZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA127|title=Ordonnances des roys de France de la troisi<U+00E8>me race}}</ref> In March 1480, the King still supported his preferred university.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=j3kUAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA538|title=Lettres patentes de Louis XI, Plessis-du-Parc-l<U+00E8>z-Tours, mars 1480 (1479 avant P<U+00E2>ques)}}</ref>

The dauphin Louis made numerous stays in Valence where, as a sign of allegiance, he donated a gate to the city, the Sauni<U+00E8>re gate and a few houses nearby. It made for a "delphinal palace", later occupied by the religious order of the [[Recollects]]. As Louis XI, he allowed a market in the town of Valence, in 1476, during his stay in the city<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=j3kUAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA189|title=Lettres patentes de Louis XI, Valence, mars 1476 (1475 avant P<U+00E2>ques)}}</ref> and confirmed tax privileges for the city of Valence.

This era ended abruptly in 1562 during the occupation of the city by the troops of the Protestant [[Fran<U+00E7>ois de Beaumont, baron des Adrets|Baron des Adrets]]: All the religious buildings of Valence were partially or completely destroyed.

===Early Modern era===
[[File:Valence - Pont suspendu.jpg|thumb|left|The Segiun gateway (1900), built from 1827 replaced the old stone bridge, and then by the current Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Mistral Bridge.]]

[[Fran<U+00E7>ois Rabelais]] studied at Valence in 1532, before settling in Lyon, a great cultural centre where the library trade blossomed.

A strategic point of the Rhone Valley, Valence was a military place since its origin and had 7,100 inhabitants in the 1700s. It was to them to bear the responsibility of housing men of war and it was also to reduce this scourge that a municipal deliberation was offered, in 1714, with the construction of barracks in the current ''Rue Bouffier''.<ref name="Bonaparte et Valence">{{cite web|url=http://www.bonaparte-a-valence.fr/bonaparte_et_valence.html/|title=Bonaparte et Valence}}</ref> a A temporary camp which quickly became inadequate to accommodate 12,000 men and 20,000 Cavalry horses, the city invested 190,000 [[French livre|livres]] for the installation of new barracks in the Rollin quarter, north of the Roman road.

[[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] passed through the town during his [[Charles IX's grand tour of France|royal tour of France]] (1564-1566), accompanied by the [[Cour de France|Court]] and the nobles of the Kingdom: His brother the [[Henry III of France|Duke of Anjou]], [[Henry IV of France|Henri de Navarre]] and the [[Charles de Bourbon (cardinal)|Cardinals of Bourbon]] and [[Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine|Lorraine]].<ref>Guerres de religion, Miquel, p.254</ref>

It was in Valence that the saga of [[Louis Mandrin]] ended in May 1755, the smuggler who challenged the [[Ferme G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale]] and redistributed the proceeds of his theft from it. After spending several days in the city prison, Mandrin was [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]: It was conducted on the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Place des Clercs|Place des Clercs|''Place des Clercs''}} where the scaffold was erected, his death ensued on the [[breaking wheel]]. His body was exposed after his death, during three days, and many people flocked to pay him a last tribute, as his popularity increased. The death of Mandrin on the wheel of Valence marked the end of his actions, but also the beginning of a legend, as the man had marked the minds of his contemporaries.

[[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] was assigned in the city from 1785 to 1786 in the La F<U+00E8>re [[artillery]] regiment. He made many future visits.<ref name="Bonaparte et Valence"/> He would indeed return repeatedly to Valence. It included crossing the city on 12 October 1799, during the return of the expedition to Egypt, and offered to his former landlady who came to welcome him at the posthouse, a cashmere of India (offered to the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament), a compass and a powder spoon (available at the Museum of Valence in 1862). He also met the future Cardinal {{Interlanguage link|fr|Giuseppe Spina|Giuseppe Spina|Spina}}, who would negotiate on behalf of [[Pope Pius VII]] in the Concordat of 1801, on the same day.

After the convening of the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]], agitation and anxiety grew until the [[storming of the Bastille]], news of which reached the region around 20 July, causing hope but also increasing concerns of a [[reactionary]] plot of aristocrats.<ref>Yoichi Uriu, <U+00AB> [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ahrf_0003-4436_1990_num_280_1_1320 Espace et R<U+00E9>volution : enqu<U+00EA>te, grande peur et f<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>rations] <U+00BB>, ''Annales historiques de la R<U+00E9>volution fran<U+00E7>aise''. no.280, 1990, p.154.</ref> The [[Great Fear]] arose in the region of a rumor, and spread by degrees, at a blistering pace according to local networks, putting all the villages in motion for their defence.<ref>Uriu, opcit, p.155.</ref> Once the peak of fear passed, a latent anxiety remained, the village communities realised that in an emergency, they were in fact isolated and practically reduced to their own devices.<ref>Uriu, opcit, p.156-157.</ref> [[National Guard (France)|National guards]] were formed quickly, including in Valence, but communities found it insufficient, and they constituted local federations of mutual assistance, bypassing the old provincial divisions. In the region, it was [[Largenti<U+00E8>re]] which called for a F<U+00EA>te de la F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration on 23 August, [[Romans-sur-Is<U+00E8>re]] in September, [[La Voulte-sur-Rh<U+00F4>ne|La Voulte]] gathered 12,000 National Guardsmen to the ''Champs de l<U+2019><U+00C9>toile'' on 29 November.<ref>Uriu, opcit, p.157-158.</ref> Valence invited the surrounding communities on 31 January and brought together 16,000 guards of 293 communes.<ref>Uriu, opcit, p.158.</ref> The region had other celebrations of federation in the winter and spring, culminating in the [[F<U+00EA>te de la F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration]] of 14 July 1790, celebrated in Paris and simultaneously in 250 cities in France, including Valence.<ref>Uriu, opcit, p.160.</ref>

The university disappeared in 1792 to be reborn at the end of the 20th century.

====Armenian community====
[[Image:M<U+00E9>morial de l'affiche rouge.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial of the Manouchian group of Valence]]

After the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915, many Armenians took refuge in France in the 1920s. In memory of the community, the first arrivals were recruited by Valence employers who went to Marseille to recruit 150 in 1922.<ref name="acam"/> There were 827 Armenians settled in Valence by 1926, and 1,670 in 1931,<ref>P. Garagnon, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rga_0035-1121_1956_num_44_3_1781 La colonie arm<U+00E9>nienne de Valence-sur-Rh<U+00F4>ne], ''Revue de g<U+00E9>ographie alpine'', 1956, Tome 44, n<U+00B0>3, p.524.</ref> from [[Bursa]], [[Malatya]] and [[Elaz<U+0131><U+011F>|Harput]].<ref name="acam"/> If the Armenians were popular among their employers, they encountered the distrust of the Valence people.<ref name="acam"/><ref>Garagnon, opcit, p.538.</ref> It was a group whith a very high proportion of young adults, children and the elderly who suffered most from the genocide and the journey of exile.<ref>Garagnon, opcit, p.524-525.</ref> They were used mainly as labourers, or founded small businesses (for 25% of employees).<ref>Garagnon, opcit, p.525-526.</ref> Very quickly, an "Armenian quarter" was created, between ''Boulevard Vauban'', ''Rue Farnerie'', ''Rue Madier-Montjau'', and the ''Boulevard d'Alsace'', 40% populated by Armenians. The entire old town, with dilapidated buildings, abandoned and inexpensive, was concerned by these facilities.<ref>Garagnon, opcit, p.526 and 533.</ref>

In 1956, the group had 2,500 people, or 6% of the population of Valence, and was the fourth Armenian community in France (after those of Paris, Lyon and Marseille).<ref>Garagnon, opcit, p.523.</ref> The community's very strong identity (with newspapers, cinemas, dance halls, Armenian Sports Union) was dispersed, with the 'Armenian village' on the ''Rue de Fontlozier''.<ref>Garagnon, opcit, p.534.</ref> It showed signs of rapid integration: In 1946, half of the 2,000 Armenians of Valencia opted for French citizenship.<ref>Garagnon, opcit, p.537.</ref>

In 1947, 200 Armenians of Valence took advantage of the offer to return to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] countries, which proved to be a failure. The strong community welcomed new refugees, fleeing Syria (1960s) or the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. Today, 7,500 Valence people belong to this community,<ref name="acam">Krikor Amirzayan, [http://www.acam-france.org/contacts/diaspora-france/rhone.htm Valence, la ville arm<U+00E9>nienne], ''Association des communaut<U+00E9>s arm<U+00E9>niennes'', consult<U+00E9> le 16 d<U+00E9>cembre 2013.</ref> which makes the Armenian community of Valence one of the largest in France: The Armenian National Union is also based in Valence.<ref>Garagnon, opcit, p.535.</ref>

This strong presence is passed into the [[Street or road name|odonymy]]: A street and a square of the old Armenian quarter make reference (with the ''Rue d<U+2019>Arm<U+00E9>nie'' and the ''Place [[Missak Manouchian]]'') and the cultural life of the community is very active, with 28 associations, including the Evangelical Church, the Armenian courts, and the House of Armenian culture.<ref name="acam"/>

====World War II====
After the invasion of Poland by Germany, on 1 September 1939, France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939. Germany invaded France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands on 10 May 1940.

During [[World War II]], Valence suffered several [[Allies of World War II|allied]] aerial bombardments, intended to destroy the bridge over the Rh<U+00F4>ne. On 15 August 1944, bombs destroyed several quarters and buildings in the city, including the hospital, killing 280 people. From the era of the prefecture, there remained only the gate, which has been carefully preserved since. Four days later, on 19 August 1944, a German train loaded with [[nitroglycerin]] exploded, largely destroying the quarter of La Palla and causing 335 casualties among civilians, the military and the resistance fighters. On 2 August 1944, south of Valence, bombings of the railway depot and yard of [[Portes-l<U+00E8>s-Valence]] destroyed 51 locomotives, with 12 victims and 58 wounded among the railway workers and the population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajpn.org/commune-Portes-les-Valence-26252.html|title=Portes-l<U+00E8>s-Valence en 1939-1945}}</ref>

The northern part of Valence, almost completely razed to the ground, was rebuilt and today one finds many administrative buildings in this area such as the {{Interlanguage link|fr|H<U+00F4>tel de pr<U+00E9>fecture de la Dr<U+00F4>me|H<U+00F4>tel de pr<U+00E9>fecture de la Dr<U+00F4>me|Hotel of prefecture of the Dr<U+00F4>me}}, the general [[treasury]], [[social security]], the post office and the police headquarters.

Dr<U+00F4>me was one of the departments where the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] was the most active.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aeri-resistance.com/html/26.php|title=La R<U+00E9>sistance dans la Dr<U+00F4>me}}</ref> In 1943, the Resistance was organised and grew, and many Dr<U+00F4>me people were called and committed themselves to the cause. With the introduction of the [[Service du travail obligatoire|STO]], young men were required to go to work in Germany. Many of them refused this situation and went into hiding in the countryside or joined the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]]. Resistance developed throughout the entire department in small units. The Dr<U+00F4>me terrain was conducive to the installation of camps. The population supported increasing resistance.

==Politics and administration==

===Municipal administration===
[[File:Valence 2006-03-03 006.jpg|thumb|left|The city hall]]
[[File:Nicolas Daragon.jpg|thumb|right|Nicolas Daragon, mayor of Valence since 2014]]

The [[city]] of Valence is a [[territorial collectivity]] administered by a [[City council (France)|municipal council]] which is the deliberative assembly of the [[Communes of France|commune]] and which aims to regulate by its deliberations the business of the municipality. The municipal council elects the [[Mayor (France)|mayor]]. As for any commune whose population is between 60,000 and 79,999 inhabitants, this council is has 49 members (mayor, 14 deputies and 34 municipal councillors) elected by direct universal suffrage for a renewable term of six years.

The current mayor of Valence is Nicolas Daragon, a member of the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] elected in 2014. The current council was elected in April 2014.

The [[Seat of local government|City Hall]] of Valence employs more than 1,700 municipal officers (permanent and non-permanent jobs) representing more than 100 trades and all exercising a public service mission, ranging from the maintenance of roads, maintenance of parks, the management of cultural and sports coaching schools, etc.

Following the [[French municipal elections, 2014|2014 municipal elections]], the composition of the [[City council (France)|municipal council]] of Valence is as follows:

===Cantons===
{{Main|{{Interlanguage link|fr|List of cantons of Valence|Liste des cantons de Valence}}}}

Capital of the department of Dr<U+00F4>me, the city of Valence is divided into four cantons, of which it is [[chef-lieu]].

The cantonal division of Valence has evolved since the creation of the departments in 1790. Established in 1801, the canton of Valence was divided into two in 1964, and then three in 1973 and finally into four in 1984. The cantonal redistricting of 2015 led to the creation of four new cantons each containing a fraction of the commune of Valence and whole communes.

==Population and society==

===Demography===
In 2012, the municipality had 62,481 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known through the population censuses carried out in the town since 1793. From the 21st century, the communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants have a census each year as a result of a sample survey, unlike the other communes which have a real census every five years.<ref group=note>At the beginning of the 21st century, the terms of census have been amended by [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000593100&fastPos=1&fastReqId=2036940488&categorieLien=cid&oldAction=rechTexte Act No. 2002-276 of 27 February 2002], called "grassroots democracy law" on the democracy of proximity and in particular Title V "of census operations", in order, after a power transition period from 2004 to 2008, the annual publication of the legal population of the different French administrative districts. For municipalities with populations greater than 10,000 inhabitants, a sample survey is carried out annually, the entire territory of these municipalities is included at the end of the same period of five years. The first post-legal population from 1999, and fitting in the new system which came into force on 1 January 2009, is the census of 2006.</ref><ref group=note>In the census table, by Wikipedia convention, the principle was retained for subsequent legal populations since 1999 not to display the census populations in the table corresponding to the year 2006, the first published legal population calculated according to the concepts defined in Decree No. 2003-485 of 5 June 2003, and the years corresponding to an exhaustive census survey for municipalities with less than 10,000 inhabitants, and the years 2006, 2011, 2016, etc. For municipalities with more than 10,000, the latest legal population is published by INSEE for all municipalities.</ref>

Vieux Valence [Old Valence] is a quarter in the old city of Valence, based primarily around the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Place des Clercs|Place des Clercs|''Place des Clercs''}} and also including the lower town district. It is expected the 19th century so that the city's ramparts, replaced by boulevards in 1860. Valencia then grows in range around its ancient centre. In this area that formerly comprised the historic centre of the city of Valencia, there are:

[[Valence Cathedral|Saint-Apollinaire Cathedral]] is a [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] cathedral, which was built in the 11th century. It was the Bishop Gontard (1063-1099) who drove construction of this edifice which is now the oldest in the city. Several blocks of stone from the Saint-Apollinaire Cathedral were reused from the Gallo-Roman buildings of the city of ''Valentia''. The [[Valence Cathedral|Cathedral of St. Apollinaris]], which has an architecturally notable [[apse]], and was consecrated in 1095 by pope [[Pope Urban II|Urban II]]. It suffered extensive damage in the [[French Wars of Religion]], but it was restored in the first decade of the 17th century. The porch and the stone tower above it were rebuilt in 1861. The church contains the monument of [[Pope Pius VI|Pius VI]], who died at Valence in 1799. The library and the museum containing Roman antiquities, sculptures, and a picture gallery are housed in the old ecclesiastical seminary.

The {{Interlanguage link|fr|Maison des T<U+00EA>tes de Valence|Maison des T<U+00EA>tes de Valence|Maison des T<U+00EA>tes}}, built between 1528 and 1532 by Antoine de Dorne, Consul in Valence, royal Professor at the University, the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] fa<U+00E7>ade with several heads carved representing the winds, fortune, time and even theology. This House, marking the transition from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] to the Renaissance style, owes its name to the many heads that adorn its facade. The corridor is decorated with busts of [[List of Roman emperors|Roman emperors]]. The building has been classified as a historical monument since 1944.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=REF&VALUE_1=PA00117093|title=Monuments historiques|language=fr|trans-title=Historic monuments|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>

The {{Interlanguage link|fr|Mus<U+00E9>e des beaux-arts de Valence (France)|Mus<U+00E9>e des beaux-arts de Valence (France)|Museum of Fine Arts of Valence}} is the only museum of its kind in [[Dr<U+00F4>me]], its collections bring together paintings, drawings, sculptures, decorative arts from the 16th century to the 20th century. Created in 1850 and installed in the former bishopric since 1911, it houses a hundred drawings by [[Hubert Robert]] with lots of [[sanguine]]. The work to expand the museum (which began in 2009) was completed in December 2013. The new layout of the museum consists of 35 rooms, spread over five floors: On the ground floor are archaeological collections which are continued on the fifth and fourth floors, then going back in time, down to the lower levels. The layout permits easy circulation by stairs and elevators, and privileged with natural lighting, opening many views over the city and the Rh<U+00F4>ne, while highlighting the architecture of the former bishopric.

The {{Interlanguage link|fr|Pendentif de Valence}}, a building of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] inspiration, which is probably the funerary monument of Nicolas Mistral, Canon of the Saint-Apollinaire Cathedral, seems to have been built in 1548, from a stone engraved with an inscription to that effect. This monument was transformed, after the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], into a drinking establishment. It was bought by the city of Valence around 1830 and is part of the first monuments registered national [[Monument historique|historical monuments]] inventory after a visit by [[Prosper M<U+00E9>rim<U+00E9>e]] in Dr<U+00F4>me.

The {{Interlanguage link|fr|Maison du Drapier}}, a 13th-century house, keeps a medieval aspect despite the restorations of the 19th century. It probably, belonged originally to a rich clothier. The ground floor was devoted to artisanal production and trade, while the floors sheltered the housing of the craftsman.

The ''Maison de la Pra'', a 15th-century mansion, property of Claude Fr<U+00E8>re, a rich merchant who was first president of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Parlement du Dauphin<U+00E9>}}. The lantern of the staircase stands on the ancient walls between the Tower of the Cathedral and the belfry of Saint John, in the heart of the old town.

The {{Interlanguage link|fr|Maison Dupr<U+00E9>-Latour}}, dating from the 16th century, has a remarkable staircase tower. The ''Maison Dupr<U+00E9>-Latour'' is a former mansion that was built by the Genas family, traders enriched by the salt trade. In 1760, the building was bought by Fran<U+00E7>ois Dupr<U+00E9>-Latour whose name would remain attached to the building and whose descendants continue to live there. In 1993, the building was transferred to the city and has been classified as an historical monument since 1927.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=REF&VALUE_1=PA00117092|title=Monuments historiques|language=fr|trans-title=Historic monuments|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>

The moorish house known as ''Mauresque <U+00E0> Ferlin'', after the name of its owner, was built in 1858 and of oriental inspiration.

The {{Interlanguage link|fr|<U+00C9>glise Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Valence|<U+00C9>glise Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Valence|Church of Saint-Jean-Baptiste}} (11th century and 12th century) and its 19th-century Romanesque Revival gatehouse. This church of the old town is perched at the highest point of the city, signs of its age. It would be one of the first places of [[Christianity|Christian]] worship then emerging in Valence.

The temple of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Abbaye Saint-Ruf de Valence|Abbaye Saint-Ruf de Valence|Abbaye Saint-Ruf}}, former chapel of a Roman priory. The Order of the Canons Regular of {{Interlanguage link|fr|Ruf d'Avignon|Ruf d'Avignon|Saint Ruf}} was born in Avignon, where a small community of clerics became one of the spearheads of the reform of the clergy in the Rhone valley and beyond. The importance acquired by the canons of Saint-Ruf generated tensions with the cathedral chapter, which led to the transfer of the head of order (i.e. the mother abbey) in Valence.

The ''<U+00E9>glise Notre-Dame'' [Church of Our Lady], located on ''Rue Berthelot''. Built in the mid-nineteenth century, offices there are now led by the [[Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter]] according to the extraordinary form of the [[Tridentine Mass|Roman rite]].

The Italian theatre dates back to 1837. The site is that of the former Saint Mary of the Visitation convent. Initially, the desire was to erect a city hall. After long drawn-out construction decisions, the city took advantage of a windfall from a private initiative for the construction of a theatre. The Italian room was built between 1886 and 1887 by the architect Ange Madona. The domed ceiling is treated in [[trompe-l'<U+0153>il]]; it recalls the Temple of Arts and depicts four genres (drama, comedy, opera and vaudeville). Completely renovated in the 1990s, the theatre of the city is one of the jewels of the 19th century architecture in Valence. It has 390 seats, a rehearsal room, and a dance studio.

The {{Interlanguage link|fr|Abbaye Notre-Dame de Soyons}} is a former abbey of Benedictine women which was founded in 1632 by the transfer of the Abbey of St. John the Evangelist, from the village of [[Soyons]] ([[Ard<U+00E8>che]]) as a result of the Wars of Religion. It was registered as an historical monument from 1926.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=REF&VALUE_1=PA00117084|title=Monuments historiques|language=fr|trans-title=Historic monuments|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>

The city hall, located on the ''Place de la Libert<U+00E9>'' in the heart of the city centre, was inaugurated in 1894. Its architecture is special, because it has a [[Belfry (architecture)|belfry]], a secular steeple symbolising the independence of the city against the Catholic Church, a classical facade and a roof of tiles of different colors. It hosts the activities of the town hall, with the offices of the mayor, city council and administrative services.

The {{Interlanguage link|fr|Centre du patrimoine arm<U+00E9>nien de Valence|Centre du patrimoine arm<U+00E9>nien de Valence|Armenian heritage centre}} is a place of history and memory that addresses the original news around major themes: Migration, the memory of conflicts and the history of peoples and cultures. Indeed, Valence has one of the largest [[Armenia]]n communities in France. The Armenian heritage centre is installed in the former Faculty of Law at the heart of the pedestrian centre of Valence, close to the historic Valence quarter of Armenian origin (concentrated around the ''Rue Bouffier'', ''Rue Armenia'' and ''Rue Belle Image'').

The ''ancienne pr<U+00E9>fecture'', near the ''Place Saint-Jean'', where remains only the monumental entrance gate. The rest was destroyed in a bombing raid during [[World War II]] on 15 August 1944. It has been at this place since the end of the 18th century. Previously, at the abbatial palace of {{Interlanguage link|fr|Abbaye Saint-Ruf de Valence|Abbaye Saint-Ruf de Valence|Saint-Ruf}}.

The {{Interlanguage link|fr|Place des Clercs}} is lined by colorful facades. It is from the 5th century, when the episcopal district was created, that the Place des Clercs began to gain importance. Shops settled, markets took place and did justice. In the [[Middle Ages]] there were two churches: The cathedral from the 11th century and Notre-Dame de la Ronde which was older (a remaining column is currently in the public toilets). The Wars of Religion significantly deteriorated these buildings.

The "c<U+00F4>tes", picturesque mounts of the upper town. There are traces of the walls at the top of the C<U+00F4>te Sainte-Ursule and at the bottom of C<U+00F4>te Sylvante; they served to protect the city from invasions, epidemics or flooding caused by the Rh<U+00F4>ne. They were widely used in medieval times by the people (boatmen, carters, mule, etc.) who used these stairs to go to the small streets and squares of the upper town. The C<U+00F4>te Sainte-Ursule meanwhile was less used; it separated the properties of two monasteries. It is set at the location of the Roman theatre and probably served as an exit. One may also include the C<U+00F4>tes Saint-Martin, Saint-Est<U+00E8>ve, des Chapeliers and la Vo<U+00FB>te.

====In the city====
The "Boulevards de Valence", a wide promenade, traced on the former location of the ramparts and tree-lined with [[Georges-Eug<U+00E8>ne Haussmann|Hausmannian]]-style buildings, which had a renovation from 2004 to 2009.

The [[bandstand]] built in 1860 on the esplanade of the Champ de Mars served as the model the designer {{Interlanguage link|fr|Raymond Peynet}} to immortalize his love, and which carries the name of {{Interlanguage link|fr|Kiosque Peynet|Kiosque Peynet|Peynet kiosk}}. It is classified a historical monument since 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=REF&VALUE_1=PA00117090|title=Monuments historiques|accessdate=5 May 2015}}</ref>

The {{Interlanguage link|fr|Fontaine monumentale|Fontaine monumentale|monumental fountain}}, designed by the architect Eug<U+00E8>ne Poitoux and dating from 1887, is located in the city centre, on the boulevards. In 2005, the fountain was renovated and moved a few metres, in order to better integrate into the perspective of the renovated boulevards and in 2006, a copy of the winged genius, which was destroyed in 1954 by lightning which struck the column, was replaced at the top of the column.

{{Interlanguage link|fr|Parc Jouvet|Parc Jouvet|Jouvet Park}}, a public garden of {{convert|7|ha|acre}} created in 1905, and opened by president [[<U+00C9>mile Loubet]], bears the name of Th<U+00E9>odore Jouvet, donor of the land, and includes more than 700 trees of various species. This park also has a pet shop, a small train, and a rose garden.

[[Gare de Valence-Ville|Valence-Ville]] station, has a fa<U+00E7>ade which was inspired by the [[Petit Trianon]] at Versailles. The passenger building of today, which was comissioned in April 1866, was designed by {{Interlanguage link|fr|Louis-Jules Bouchot}},<ref>{{cite journal|first=Fran<U+00E7>ois|last=Pourpardin|title=Les b<U+00E2>timents voyageurs <U+00E9>difi<U+00E9>s le long de la ligne imp<U+00E9>riale (La Compagnie du PLM : les gares de l'architecte Jules Bouchot)|journal=[[Revue d<U+2019>histoire des chemins de fer]]|issue=38|year=2008|pages=59<U+2013>71|url=http://rhcf.revues.org/404}}</ref> architect of [[Napoleon III]]. The main fa<U+00E7>ade on the ''Rue du Pavillon Central'' has been registered as an [[Monument historique|historic monument]] since 11 October 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=REF&VALUE_1=PA00117088|title=Monuments historiques|accessdate=5 May 2015}}</ref>

The esplanade of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Champ de Mars (Valence)|Champ de Mars (Valence)|Champ de Mars}}, which before the conversion work of 2001 was a car park dotted with plane trees, is today a wide tree-lined esplanade, where one can see beyond the Rh<U+00F4>ne to the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Crussol]], at the forefront of the Ard<U+00E8>che mountains.

The Philolaus water tower (first studies of the sculptor in 1963), built between 1969 and 1971, is located in {{Interlanguage link|fr|Parc Jean-Perdrix|Parc Jean-Perdrix|Jean-Perdrix Park}}, between the quarters of le Plan and Fontbarlettes, east of the city. It consists of two twisted towers with high clean lines, {{convert|52|m}} and {{convert|57|m}} high, which combine functionality and artistic research. In 1981, he received the "prix du quartier de l'Horloge" [prize of the quarter of the clock] for the best work of urban art in the 1970s. The water tower sculpture was distinguished by the label "20th century" in 2003 and was the subject of a stamp in 2013.

====The Valence channels====
A unique ecological and [[natural heritage]] in France, channels accompany Valence since [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]]. The name of Valence comes from three Celtic words: "val" (water), "len" (plain) and "ty" (House) and would mean "water-rich inhabited place".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valence.fr/fr/cadre-de-vie/canaux/|title=Origine celte du nom de Valence}}</ref> At the time these rivers allowed the inhabitants to satisfy many needs and activities: Fishing, irrigation, washing, soaking, driving force for flour mills, oil, fuller and silk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valence.fr/fr/cadre-de-vie/canaux/|title=Les canaux de Valence}}</ref> They are now a place to walk for many inhabitants.

It is in the neighborhoods east of Valence, at the foot of a terrace, the ''terrasse du s<U+00E9>minaire'', that the channels (with a total length of {{convert|17|km}}, or {{convert|40|km}} when counting secondary irrigation channels) originate. Very quickly, the Valence people strove to channel these waters forming unhealthy marshes. In the 13th century, the regulation and the use of the channels was the privilege of the monasteries of Saint-Ruf and Saint-Victor, who decided the location of the mills.

Indeed, the water used for irrigation, drinking water and washhouses, was also a valuable source of energy for the economic development of the era. The main (''Charran'', ''Thon'', ''Moulins'' and ''Malcontents'') cross the city from east to west before joining to form the {{Interlanguage link|fr|<U+00C9>pervi<U+00E8>re (river)|<U+00C9>pervi<U+00E8>re (rivi<U+00E8>re)|Canal de l'<U+00C9>pervi<U+00E8>re}} which then flows into the [[Rh<U+00F4>ne]]. In the 19th century, the channels lost their significance and would even be a little forgotten, hidden by urbanisation, high-rise buildings and roads.

In recent years, the municipality has undertaken a development work of paths, bordered by poplars and willows, along these channels. Green routes have been signposted along the canals of ''des Malcontents'', ''de la Grande Marquise'', ''de Thibert'', '' du Charran'' and ''de Californie''. Channels which still continue to water gardens. The municipality also wants to promote gentle travel along the banks of the channels.
