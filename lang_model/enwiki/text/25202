Out of four conferences,<ref name="Communistcrimes"/> the third took place in the famous [[Tatra Mountains]] spa of [[Zakopane]]<ref name="museum0"/> in Poland, and is the most remembered (the ''Zakopane Conference''). From the Soviet side, several officers of the [[NKVD]] participated in these meetings, and the Germans brought a group of experts from the ''[[Gestapo]]''.

==Prelude==
[[Image:Karte viertepolnischeteilung.png|right|thumb|300px|Eastern Europe in 1939-1940.]]

In 1939, after the signing of the [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]] in August, the [[German invasion of Poland]] on 1 September<ref name="Zaloga0">Zaloga, S.J. (2003) ''Poland 1939'' Osprey ISBN 1 84176 408 6</ref><ref name="History0">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/this_day_in_history/this_day_September_1.php |title=1 September - This Day in History |publisher=Thehistorychannel.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-05}}</ref> and [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasion of Poland]] on 17 September<ref name="Zaloga0"/><ref name="Davies0">Davies, N.

==First Conference==
Little is known about this meeting. It reportedly took place on September 27, 1939 in [[Brzesc nad Bugiem]], while some units of the [[Polish Army]] were still fighting (see: [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Invasion of Poland]]). As both sides correctly expected that Polish resistance would start soon, they discussed ways of dealing with the possible activities of such resistance.<ref name="voskresenie"/>

==Second Conference==
It took place some time at the end of November 1939, probably in [[Przemy<U+015B>l]]<ref name="voskresenie"/> <U+2014> a city which<U+2014>between September 1939 and June 1941<U+2014>was divided into two parts, German and Soviet. Apart from talks of fighting Polish resistance, the Soviets and the Germans discussed ways of exchanging Polish [[POW]]s. Also, first discussions about the [[Occupation of Poland (1939-1945)|occupation of Poland]] were started. Some historians claim this meeting took place in [[Lviv]].<ref name="museum0"/><ref name="Rees0">Rees, Laurence (2008) ''World War Two Behind Closed Doors'' BBC Books ISBN 978-0-56-349335-8</ref> It is also claimed a meeting was held in December.<ref name="museum1"/><ref name="poland0">{{cite web|url=http://www.polandsholocaust.org/1939.html |title=de beste bron van informatie over polands holocaust.

They will suppress in their territories all beginnings of such agitation and inform each other concerning suitable measures for this purpose."]]

==Third Conference==
This one is the best known, and took place in [[Zakopane]],<ref name="Warsaw">{{cite web|url=http://www.warsawuprising.com/paper/jankowski1.htm |title=Warsaw Uprising Witnesses: Dr. Jan Moor-Jankowski |publisher=Warsawuprising.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-05}}</ref> starting on February 20, 1940<ref name="museum1"/> in the villa "Pan Tadeusz", located on the road from Zakopane to [[Bia<U+0142>ka Tatrza<U+0144>ska]]. The German side was represented by [[Adolf Eichmann]] and an official by the name of Zimmermann, who later became chief of the [[Radom District]] of the [[General Government]]. The Soviet delegation was headed by Grigoriy Litvinov and <U+2014>among others<U+2014>[[Rita Zimmerman]] (director of a gold mine in [[Kolyma]]) and a man named Eichmans, creator of an efficient way of killing in the back of the head.<ref name="voskresenie"/>

According to several sources, one of the effects of this conference was the German ''Ausserordentliche Befriedungsaktion'' (see: [[German AB Action operation in Poland]]),<ref name="Crimes0">http://www.mp.gov.si/fileadmin/mp.gov.si/pageuploads/2005/PDF/publikacije/Crimes_committed_by_Totalitarian_Regimes.pdf</ref> elimination of Krakow inteligentia [[Sonderaktion Krakau]] and the Soviet [[Katyn massacre]]<ref name="museum1"/><ref name="Conquest0">Conquest, Robert (1991). ''Stalin: Breaker of Nations'' Phoenix ISBN 1-84212-439-0 Page 229</ref> In his 1991 book ''Stalin: Breaker of Nations'', British historian [[Robert Conquest]] stated: "Terminal horror suffered by so many millions of innocent Jewish, Slavic, and other European peoples as a result of this meeting of evil minds is an indelible stain on the history and integrity of Western civilization, with all of its humanitarian pretensions". Also, professor [[George Watson (academic)|George Watson]] from [[Cambridge University]] concluded in his "Rehearsal for the Holocaust?" Commentary (June 1981) that [[Katyn massacre|the fate]] of the interned Polish officers may have been decided at this conference.<ref name="ibiblio0">[http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/history/marshall/military/wwii/special.studies/katyn.massacre/katynlrc.txt Louis Robert Coatney. The Katyn Massacre]</ref><ref name="commentary1">[https://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/rehearsal-for-the-holocaust--6421?mode=addview George Watson. Rehearsal for the Holocaust?]</ref> This is however disputed by other historians, who point out that there is no documentary evidence confirming any cooperation on that issue, that the existing Soviet documentation actually makes such a cooperation improbable and that it is reasonable to say that Germany did not know about the Katyn massacre until the corpses were found. Specifically, historian [[Oleg Vishlyov]] points out that the alleged third conference in Zakopane in 1940 is not proven by any known German or Soviet documents and its description is only based on Bor-Komorowski's claims.<ref>See e.g. Slawomir Kalbarczyk, "Zbrodnia Katynska po 70 latach: krotki przeglad ustalen historiografii" (in ''Zbrodnia Katynska. W kregu prawdy i klamstwa'', IPN, Warszawa, 2010, pp. 18-19); Witold Wasilewski, "Wsp<U+00F3><U+0142>praca sowiecko-niemiecka a zbrodnia katy<U+0144>ska" in ''Pami<U+0119><U+0107> i Sprawiedliwo<U+015B><U+0107>'', 2009, nr.1.; <U+041E>.<U+0412>. <U+0412><U+0438><U+0448><U+043B><U+0451><U+0432>, ''<U+041D><U+0430><U+043A><U+0430><U+043D><U+0443><U+043D><U+0435> 22 <U+0438><U+044E><U+043D><U+044F> 1941 <U+0433><U+043E><U+0434><U+0430>'', <U+041C>.: <U+041D><U+0430><U+0443><U+043A><U+0430>, 2001, <U+0441>.119-123; N. Lebedeva, A. Cienciala, W. Materski, ''Katyn: a crime without punishment'', Yale University Press, 2007, p. 143.</ref>

==Fourth Conference==
The fourth and last meeting took place in March 1940 in [[Krakow]]<ref name="Stenton0">Stenton, M. ''Radio London and Resistance in Occupied Europe'' Oxford,2000 ISBN 978-0198208433  [http://books.google.com/books?id=iQg3yRz6TYoC&pg=PA277&dq=gestapo-nkvd+conference page 277]</ref> (according to some historians, it was part of the Zakopane Conference). This event was described by General [[Tadeusz B<U+00F3>r-Komorowski]], commander of [[Armia Krajowa]] in his book <U+201C>Armia Podziemna<U+201D> (<U+201C>The Secret Army<U+201D>). In it, he describes how a special delegation of NKVD came to Krakow, which was going to discuss with Gestapo how to act against the Polish resistance. The talks lasted for several weeks.<ref name="Bor0">B<U+00F3>r-Komorowski, T. (1950). ''The Secret Army'' Victor Gollancz Page 46</ref><ref name="eesti">{{cite web|url=http://www.eesti.ca/?op=article&articleid=24922 |title=Nazi-Soviet complicity in Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact especially blatant in NKVD-Gestapo co-operation - EWR |publisher=Eesti.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-05-05}}</ref>

Bor-Komorowski<U+2032>s description is disputed by Russian historian Oleg Vishlyov, who, based on the original Soviet documents, points out that the conference was not between NKVD and ''Gestapo'', but between Soviet and German commissions dealing with refugees. The topic of discussion was refugee exchange. The conference has nothing to do with repressions against Poles or with the Katyn massacre.<ref><U+041E>.<U+0412>. <U+0412><U+0438><U+0448><U+043B><U+0451><U+0432>, ''<U+041D><U+0430><U+043A><U+0430><U+043D><U+0443><U+043D><U+0435> 22 <U+0438><U+044E><U+043D><U+044F> 1941 <U+0433><U+043E><U+0434><U+0430>'', <U+041C>.: <U+041D><U+0430><U+0443><U+043A><U+0430>, 2001, <U+0441>.119-123.</ref> In fact, numerous historians point out that there is no evidence of German-Soviet cooperation in the Katyn massacre.<ref>See e.g. Slawomir Kalbarczyk, "Zbrodnia Katynska po 70 latach: krotki przeglad ustalen historiografii" (in ''Zbrodnia Katynska. W kregu prawdy i klamstwa'', IPN, Warszawa, 2010, pp. 18-19); Witold Wasilewski, "Wsp<U+00F3><U+0142>praca sowiecko-niemiecka a zbrodnia katy<U+0144>ska" in ''Pami<U+0119><U+0107> i Sprawiedliwo<U+015B><U+0107>'', 2009, nr.1.; N.
