==Plot==
While at the Ogdenville Outlet Mall buying a new TV (after [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa Simpson]] wrecks the old one while trying to change the channel), Marge purchases a $90 [[Chanel]] suit at a discount fashion store, and without any special place to wear it, she runs errands around town in it. At the [[Kwik-E-Mart]], she meets an old high school acquaintance, Evelyn Peters, who invites Marge to the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] [[Country Club]]. Marge begins visiting the country club, and works hard to fit in with the snobbish members, finding less time for her children and spending it all socializing and altering her suit to appear like multiple outfits.

Meanwhile, Homer takes a fondness to [[golf]], meeting [[PGA Tour]] professional [[Tom Kite]], who considers Homer to be a natural. When [[Mr. Burns]] discovers Homer showing off his impressive skills in a bathroom at work, he has [[Waylon Smithers]] schedule a match for the two. Burns appears to be an amazing player before it is revealed that Smithers has been cheating on his behalf for decades by secretly placing a ball on the green for each shot. Homer wants to reveal the truth, but is told that Mr. Burns will block the family's Country Club entry if he goes public.

On the eve of the gala ball in which the family will be granted membership in the country club, Marge accidentally destroys the suit, and rushes back to the outlet mall to find another dress. Being unable to find one, she heads to a Chanel store to purchase an expensive replacement. As they approach the country club, she impatiently berates her family, who are hurt by her haughty new perceptions of them. Marge relents and realizes that her desire to fit in has changed her personality and that she was happier being her old self. She decides she would rather go back to the way things were than continue to pursue high social ambitions.

Dietter remembered that it "took on a more serious tone" because they had to keep the parts that were essential to the story and cut the many "throwaway gags".<ref name="Dietter"/> [[Bill Oakley]], the [[show runner]] of ''The Simpsons'' at the time, praised the episode for having a "terrific" story that "really comes together well". Oakley said that he and his partner [[Josh Weinstein]] wanted to have more "emotionally" based episodes this season that still had humor in them. He thought Crittenden did a "good job" at that and he thought the episode "came out well".<ref name="Oakley">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

Marge's dress was modeled on an actual [[Pink Chanel suit of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy|Chanel dress]], and also the type of dresses that former [[First Lady]] [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] used to wear.<ref name="Oakley"/> The show's creator, [[Matt Groening]], was worried that such a detailed dress would look "weird" on a ''Simpsons'' character because they are "simply designed" and their clothing is "very generic".<ref name="Groening">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> He ended up liking the design, though, and Dietter thought it looked "good" on Marge. Oakley also liked the design and thought the cut on Marge was "flattering".<ref name="Oakley"/> The country club women's clothes were changed in every scene, something Dietter thought was hard to do because the animators had to come up with new designs.<ref name="Dietter">{{cite video | people=Dietter, Susie|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', summed it up as follows: "Marge looks great in her Chanel, the golf scenes between Homer and Mr. Burns are brilliant, and there are many true, touching moments as Marge struggles valiantly to improve herself. Yet again, it's tempting for the viewer to urge Marge on and get the hell away from the family."<ref name="BBC"/> DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that he does not know if he "accepts" the episode as being "in character" for Marge. He said that it borrows liberally from ''[[The Flintstones]]'', but he "likes it anyway". Jacobson added that the episode "jabs the idle rich nicely", and he enjoys the golf scenes with Homer. The program succeeds despite a few problems."<ref name=dvdmovieguide>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-12-01|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonseven.shtml|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season (1995)  |publisher=DVD Movie Guide|date=2006-01-05|author=Jacobson, Colin }}</ref> Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Mr. Burns's demand for his tires to be revulcanized at the gas station.
