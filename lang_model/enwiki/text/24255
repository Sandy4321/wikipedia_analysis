{{Politics of the Netherlands}}
The '''Middle Party for City and Country''' (in Dutch: ''Middenpartij voor Stad en Land'', MPSL) was a [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch]] [[political party]] defending the interests of the [[middle class]]. The Middle Party played only a marginal role in Dutch politcs.

==Party History==
[[Image:Middenpartij.jpg|thumb|Election poster from 1929]]
The party was founded by [[Abraham Staalman]] who had previously been member of the liberal [[Liberal State Party]] (LSP) after his own [[Middle Class Party]] had merged into that. Before the elections of 1929 Staalman had founded his own party and had left the LSP parliamentary party.

The Middle Party entered in the [[Dutch general election, 1929|1929 elections]], who held a personality-based campaign around the [[Bussum]] milk industrial and anti-toll campaigner Floris Vos. The Middle Party was able to win one seat in the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]]. The party played a marginal role in parliament. Vos came into conflict with Staalman over his support for a law on mandatory closing times for shops. The party consequently fell apart in parties around Staalman and Vos, who fought legal battles over the ownership of the party's name. Neither party entered in the [[Dutch general election, 1933|1933 election]].

==Ideology & Issues==
The party wanted to increase public wealth by reducing the restrictions for trade, industry and agriculture. The most important issues of the Middle Party were the abolition of trade restriction, especially [[toll roads]], [[import tariff]]s and several levies. The party wanted to reduce government expenditure by reducing the number of [[civil servant]]s and the replacement of [[unemployment benefit]]s by [[public works]] programs.
