'''Renn Dickson Hampden''' ([[1793]] - 23 April 1868), [[England|English]] divine, was born in [[Barbados]], where his father was colonel of militia, in 1793, and was educated at [[Oriel College, Oxford]].

Having taken his B.A. degree with first-class honours in both [[classics]] and [[mathematics]] in 1813, he next year obtained the chancellor's prize for a [[Latin language|Latin]] essay, and shortly afterwards was elected to a fellowship in his college, Keble, Newman and Arnold being among his contemporaries. Having left the university in 1816 he held successively a number of curacies, and in 1827 he published ''Essays on the Philosophical Evidence of Christianity'', followed by a volume of ''Parochial Sermons illustrative of the Importance of the Revelation of God in Jesus Christ'' (1828).

In [[1829]] he returned to Oxford and was [[Bampton Lectures|Bampton lecturer]] in 1832. Notwithstanding a charge of [[Arianism]] now brought against him by the [[Oxford Movement|Tractarian]] party, he in 1833 passed from a tutorship at Oriel to the principalship of [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St Mary's Hall]]. In 1834 he was appointed [[White's Professor of Moral Philosophy]], and despite much university opposition, [[Regius Professor of Divinity]] in 1836. 

Upon the publication of his ''Observations on Religious Dissent'' in August of 1834, in which he defended the right of non-[[Anglicans]] to attend Oxford, [[John Henry Newman]] responded with the ''Elucidations''. Debate via published works and personal acrimony between the two scholars continued for two years.<ref>{{cite book| url= http://books.google.com/books?id=5F0LGNAG5-kC&pg=PA71&dq=Renn+Dickson+Hampden+controversy#v=onepage&q=Renn%20Dickson%20Hampden%20controversy&f=false | publisher= Cambridge University Press | title= Newman and Heresy: The Anglican Years | author= Stephen Thomas}}</ref> After the subsidence of the controversy, he published a ''Lecture on Tradition'', which passed through several editions, and a volume on ''The Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England''.

His nomination by Lord John Russell to the vacant see of Hereford in December 1847 was again the signal for organized opposition; and his consecration in March 1848 took place in spite of a remonstrance by many of the bishops, and the resistance of Dr John Merewether, the [[dean of Hereford]], who voted against the election.

As bishop of Hereford Dr Hampden made no change in his long-formed habits of studious seclusion, and though he showed no special ecclesiastical activity or zeal, the diocese certainly prospered in his charge. Among the more important of his later writings were the articles on [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]] and [[Socrates]], contributed to the eighth edition of the [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]], and afterwards reprinted with additions under the title of ''The Fathers of Greek Philosophy'' (Edinburgh, 1862). In 1866 he had a paralytic seizure, and died in London on the 23rd of April 1868.

His daughter, Henrietta Hampden, published ''Some Memorials of R. D. Hampden'' in 1871.
