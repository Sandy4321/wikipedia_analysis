==Career==
Born the son of John (a button manufacturer in Great Charles Street, Birmingham) and Harriet Chatwin, and educated at [[King Edward's School, Birmingham|King Edward's School]] on [[New Street, Birmingham|New Street]] and [[London University]], he was known by the name Alfred.

From 1866 he worked with his son, Philip Boughton Chatwin ([[P. B. Chatwin]]) (1873 - 1964) who became his partner in 1897.

He was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (FRIBA) on [[30 November]] [[1863]] and member of the [[Royal British Society of Sculptors]] (RBS), [[Royal Society of Arts]] (RSA), and Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|Royal Antiquary Society of Scotland]].
