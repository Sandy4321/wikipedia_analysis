'''Chester Castle''' is in the city of [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  It is sited at the southwest extremity of the area bounded by the [[Chester city walls|city walls]] ({{gbmapping|SJ404657}}).  The castle stands on an eminence overlooking the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]]. In the castle complex are the remaining parts of the medieval castle together with the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] buildings designed by [[Thomas Harrison (architect)|Thomas Harrison]] which were built between 1788 and 1813.  Parts of the neoclassical buildings are used today as [[Crown Courts]] and as a military museum.  The museum and the medieval remains are a tourist attraction.

==History==

The castle was built in 1070 by [[Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester|Hugh Lupus]], the first [[Earl of Chester]].<ref name=ccc>{{citation |url=http://www.chester.gov.uk/tourism_and_leisure-1/culture_and_leisure/grosvenor_museum/information_sheets/chester_castle.aspx |title=Information Sheet: Chester Castle |accessdate=7&nbsp;March 2008 |publisher=[[Chester City Council]] }}</ref>  It is possible that it was built on the site of an earlier [[Saxons|Saxon]] fortification but this has not been confirmed.<ref name=cow>{{citation  |url=http://www.castlewales.com/chester.html |title=Chester Castle |accessdate=7&nbsp;March 2008 |last=Northall |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=2006 |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Castles of Wales |pages= }}</ref>  The original structure would have been a [[motte-and-bailey]] castle with a wooden tower.  In the 12th century the wooden tower was replaced by a square stone tower, the Flag Tower.  During the same century the stone gateway to the inner bailey was built.  This is now known as the Agricola Tower and on its first floor is the chapel of St Mary de Castro.<ref name=ccc/>  In the 13th century, during the reign of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], the walls of an outer bailey were built, the gateway in the Agricola Tower was blocked up and residential accommodation, including a Great Hall, was built along the south wall of the inner bailey.  Later in the century, during the reign of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], a new gateway to the outer bailey was built.  This was flanked by two half-drum towers and had a drawbridge over a moat {{convert|8|m|ft}} deep.  Further additions to the castle at this time included individual chambers for the King and Queen, a new chapel and stables.<ref name=ccc/><ref name=cow/>  Prominent people held as prisoners in the crypt of the Agricola Tower were [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and [[Eleanor Cobham]], wife of [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]].<ref name=richards/>  Outside the outer bailey gate was an area known as the Gloverstone where criminals waiting for execution were handed over to the city authorities.  The Great Hall was rebuilt in the late 1570s.<ref name=ccc/> 

During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] Chester was held by the [[Cavaliers|Royalists]].<ref name=ccc/>  The castle was assaulted by [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] forces in July 1643, and in January and April 1645.<ref>{{citation  | last =Phillips  | first =A.D.M.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =Phillips, C.B.  | title =A New Historical Atlas of Cheshire  | publisher =[[Cheshire County Council]]  | date =2002  | location =Chester   | pages =37 | url =  | doi =  | id =    | isbn =0-904532-46-1 }}</ref>  Together with the rest of the city, it was [[siege|besieged]] between September 1645 and February 1646.<ref name=ccc/>  Following the civil war the castle was used as a prison, a court and a tax office.<ref name=cow/>  In 1687 [[James II of England|James II]] attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in the chapel of St Mary de Castro.<ref name=richards/>  In 1696 Chester [[Mint (coin)|mint]] was established and was managed by [[Edmund Halley]] in a building adjacent to the Half Moon tower.<ref name=cow/>  During the 1745 [[Jacobite rising|Jacobite Rebellion]] a gun emplacement was built on the wall overlooking the river.<ref name=ccc/> 

[[Image:Chester Castle 1747.jpg|280px|thumb|Engraving by [[Samuel and Nathaniel Buck|Buck Brothers]] of Chester Castle in 1747]]
By the later part of the 18th century much of the fabric of the castle had deteriorated and [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]], the prison reformer, was particularly critical of the conditions in the prison.  [[Thomas Harrison (architect)|Thomas Harrison]] was commissioned to design a new prison.  This was completed in 1792 and praised as one of the best constructed prisons in the country.  Harrison then went on to rebuild the medieval Shire Hall in [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style.  He also built two new wings, one to act as [[barracks]], the other as an [[Armory (military)|armoury]], and designed a massive new entrance to the castle site, styled the [[Propylaeum]].  All these buildings are in neoclassical style.<ref name=ccc/>  [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] comments that Harrison's work constitutes "one of the most powerful monuments of the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] in the whole of England".<ref>{{Harvnb|Pevsner and Hubbard|2003|p=157.}}</ref>

In 1925, after being used for 200 years as a warehouse and ammunition store, the crypt and chapel in the Agricola Tower were [[Consecration|reconsecrated]] by the [[Bishop of Chester]] for the use of the [[Cheshire Regiment]].  In 1939 the chapel was refurnished.<ref name=richards>{{citation  | last =Richards | first =Raymond | title =Old Cheshire Churches | publisher =Batsford | date =1947 | location =London | pages =102}}</ref>

The complex is entered from Grosvenor Road through the Propylaeum, a Grade I [[listed building]].  This consists of a massive [[entablature]] supported on widely-spaced (''areostyle'') [[Doric order|Doric columns]], flanked by temple-like lodges.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=452901 |title=Images of England: Propylaea |accessdate=7&nbsp;March 2008 |publisher=[[English Heritage]] }}</ref>  Directly ahead is the former Shire Hall (also listed Grade I) which now houses the [[Crown Court]]s. Its fa<U+00E7>ade has 19 bays, the central seven bays of which project forward and constitute a Doric [[portico]].<ref>{{citation  |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=452903 |title=Images of England: Assize Courts Block |accessdate=7&nbsp;March 2008 |publisher=[[English Heritage]] }}</ref>  To the left is the former barracks block which is now the home of the Cheshire Military Museum.<ref>{{citation  |url=http://www.chester.ac.uk/militarymuseum/ |title=Cheshire Military Museum |accessdate=7&nbsp;March 2008 |publisher=[[University of Chester]] }}</ref>  To the right is the block which was originally an armoury and later an officers' [[mess]].  Both blocks are in neoclassical style and are listed Grade I.<ref>{{citation  |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=452906 |title=Images of England:A Block|accessdate=7&nbsp;March 2008 |publisher=[[English Heritage]] }}</ref><ref>{{citation  |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=452905 |title=Images of England: B Block |accessdate=7&nbsp;March 2008 |publisher=[[English Heritage]] }}</ref>

Further to the right are the remains of the Norman castle.  The Agricola Tower is a Grade I listed building.  It is built in [[sandstone]] [[ashlar]] with a metal roof in three storeys.  The ground floor has a blocked gateway and to the right of the gateway is a slightly projecting stair turret.  Internally, the ground floor consists of a crypt, and the first floor contains the chapel of St Mary Castro.<ref>{{citation  |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=452908 |title=Images of England: Agricola Tower |accessdate=7&nbsp;March 2008|publisher=[[English Heritage]] }}</ref>  The Agricola Tower is also a [[scheduled monument]].<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1100771 |title=Pastscape:Agricola Tower |accessdate= 5&nbsp;April 2009|publisher=[[English Heritage]] }}</ref> The chapel is still consecrated as the regimental chapel of the Cheshire Regiment.  Its ceiling is covered with [[fresco]]s dating from the early part of the 13th century which depict the [[Visitation (Christian)|Visitation]] and [[miracle]]s performed by the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] which were revealed during conservation work in the 1990s.<ref name=ccc/>
