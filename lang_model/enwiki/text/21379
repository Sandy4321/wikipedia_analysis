'''New York State Route 55A''' is a state highway located in [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan]] and [[Ulster County|Ulster]] counties. It is a loop route connected to [[New York State Route 55|NY 55]] at both ends, near Grahamsville in the west and [[Napanoch, New York|Napanoch]] in the east. Inside the loop is [[New York City]]'s [[Rondout Reservoir]], which provides some beautiful scenery from both highways.

==Route description==
NY 55A leaves NY 55 just east of Grahamsville, going at first slightly northeast along the west end of the reservoir. In a mile it turns abruptly to the right once again as the roadway it follows continues as a county road to [[Sundown, New York|Sundown]].

It crosses the mouth of [[Rondout Creek]] on a long bridge over swampy areas where the creek reaches the reservoir. Afterwards it goes into much more wooded land.

It remains close to the reservoir's north shore for the rest of its route, offering many glimpses of the reservoir and access to it for those who have [[boating]] or [[angling|fishing]] permits (Otherwise, access is severely restricted). At the east end of the reservoir, the view to Merriman Dam is better from NY 55A than from NY 55.

Not long afterward, NY 55A ends at NY 55 once again.
