'''Hurricane Gaston''' was a minimal [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricane]] that made landfall in [[South Carolina]] on August 29, 2004. It then crossed [[North Carolina]] and [[Virginia]] before exiting to the northeast and dissipating. The storm killed nine people &mdash; eight of them directly &mdash; and caused $130&nbsp;million (2004&nbsp;USD) in damage. Gaston produced torrential downpours that inundated [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Although originally designated a [[tropical storm]], Gaston was reclassified as a [[hurricane]] when post-storm analysis revealed it had maximum sustained winds of 75&nbsp;mph ([[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1]] hurricane strength).<ref>Franklin, James L.[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2004gaston.shtml NHC Report on Gaston]National Hurricane Center

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Gaston 2004 track.png}}
On August 22, 2004, a cold front&mdash;the same front which eventually spawned [[Tropical Storm Hermine (2004)|Tropical Storm Hermine]]&mdash;moved off the coast of the [[Carolinas]] and drifted southward before stalling on August 24. On August 25, Surface observations indicated that a broad low pressure area developed along the deteriorating frontal boundary. Convection remained sporadic and disorganized, until thunderstorm activity began to increase and the system developed banding structure on August 26. At 1200&nbsp;UTC on August 27, the low organized, and was designated as Tropical Depression Seven while located about {{convert|130|mi|km|abbr=on}} east-southeast of [[Charleston, South Carolina]].<ref name="tcr">{{Cite web|author=James L.

Because steering currents were initially weak, the depression was nearly stationary in movement, although forecasts predicted a ridge to the northeast of the system would gradually steer it to the west. The cyclone was situated over warm ocean waters and contained good anticyclonic flow, leading forecast models to predict at least moderate intensification.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stewart/Beven|title=Tropical Depression 7 Discussion Number 1|year=2004|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-05-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2004/dis/al072004.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref> Later that same day, it gradually drifted southwest and convective banding continued to increase. At 1100&nbsp;UTC on August 28, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gaston.<Ref name="tcr"/> An [[Air Force Reserve]] [[Hurricane Hunters]] [[aircraft]] completed a flight into Gaston, revealing that the intensity was higher than previously reported. At the time, it was believed that Gaston had reached peak intensity of {{convert|70|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, placing it very close to hurricane status.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Franklin|title=Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number 7|year=2004|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-04-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2004/dis/al072004.discus.007.shtml?}}</ref> However, during post-season analysis, it was discovered that Gaston had briefly attained Category&nbsp;1 Hurricane intensity at 1800 UTC on August 28.<ref name="tcr"/> 
[[Image:Ddrain.GIF|thumb|right|Radar image of Gaston after landfall on August 29 (National Weather Service).]]
At 1400 UTC on August 29, Gaston made landfall at [[Awendaw, South Carolina]], between [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] and [[McClellanville]], as a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="tcr"/> The storm quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it continued northward through [[South Carolina]], [[North Carolina]] and [[Virginia]], and it began to gradually move north-northeastward.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Pasch|title=Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number 9|year=2004|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-04-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2004/dis/al072004.discus.009.shtml?}}</ref> At 0000 UTC on August 30, the storm weakened to a tropical depression over northeastern South Carolina.

==Preparations==
On August 27, shortly after the formation of Gaston, tropical storm watches were issued for coastal locations from [[Surf City, North Carolina]] to [[Fernandina Beach, Florida]]. On August 28, a tropical storm warning was put into effect from the [[Savannah River]] to the inlet of the [[Little River]]; shortly after, the tropical storm watch was modified to a hurricane at 0000 UTC on August 29. At 0300 UTC the tropical storm watch that was issued from Surf City, North Carolina to Fernandina Beach, Florida was upgraded to a tropical storm warning, and all other tropical storm watches were upgraded to tropical storm warnings. At 1500 UTC, all hurricane watches and warnings were discontinued and by 0000 UTC on August 30, all advisories were subsequently discontinued.<ref name="tcr"/>

==Aftermath in Richmond==
Much of downtown Richmond was a mess; many buildings in the disaster area were condemned. A story in the ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]'' said, "''The air downtown is ripe with the smell of fresh mud and rotting vegetables.''" <ref>[http://infoweb.newsbank.com.ezproxy.vccs.edu:2048/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&p_docid=104E9FA92E2F21C8&p_docnum=12&p_queryname=2&p_product=NPNB&p_theme=aggregated4&p_nbid=G56P4FECMTEzNTAxODc5My43NTc1OTM6MTo1OjEzMTYw Please Log In<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On August 31, Governor [[Mark Warner]] declared a state of emergency.<ref>[http://www.palmbeachpost.com/storm/content/weather/special/storm/2004/atlantic/gaston/news.html Storm 2004 Hurricane Season: Gaston<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Consumer concerns===
Approximately 2,000 cars and trucks were reported towed from the disaster area following Gaston. Consequently, the flooded-out cars and trucks, known as "flood cars," were sold on used car lots at a cheap price. There were also isolated reports of scamming.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55387-2004Sep27.html The Scam After the Storm? (washingtonpost.com)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Economic impact===
Many small businesses in the Richmond area were hit hard by the flooding brought by Gaston. While some managed to reopen, some closed for longer periods of time or even permanently. After the storm, city officials cordoned off Shockoe Bottom along between 15th and 18th Streets, south of East Broad Street, so building inspectors and crews from the [[Richmond, Virginia#Utilities|Department of Public Utilities]] and [[Dominion Virginia Power]] could ensure that the area's stores, restaurants, warehouses and apartments were safe to enter and that there were no gas leaks.

"''Property insurance by itself probably won't cover damages''," said a spokesman for the [[State Corporation Commission]]. "''However, many businesses in the Bottom have [[flood insurance]], since most lenders would make it a requirement in flood-prone areas...''"

"''The best other businesses can hope for, in the rebuilding process, is federal assistance through grant money and low-interest loans if Richmond is declared a federal disaster area''," he later said.<ref>[http://timesdispatch.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=RTD%2FMGArticle%2FRTD_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1031777660746&path=%21news%21special%21generic4&s=1058750351796]{{Dead link|date=March 2008}}</ref>

The flooding from Gaston also affected [[Virginia Department of Transportation|VDOT]]'s emergency road repair fund. VDOT estimated that repairing the wrecked roads and bridges would cost $10 to $20&nbsp;million, and that did not cover damage to streets and roads that [[Richmond County, Virginia|Richmond]] and [[Henrico County, Virginia|Henrico]] Counties maintain.<ref>[http://timesdispatch.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=RTD%2FMGArticle%2FRTD_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1031777692726&path=%21news%21special%21generic4&s=1058750351796]{{Dead link|date=March 2008}}</ref>

Already stretching its budget thin, VDOT had to set $16&nbsp;million aside for major projects other than snow removal, leaving very little to pay for storm damage. <ref>[http://timesdispatch.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=RTD%2FMGArticle%2FRTD_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1031777692726&path=%21news%21special%21generic4&s=1058750351796]{{Dead link|date=March 2008}}</ref>

===Recovery and criticism===
After the storm, the Richmond city government poured money into reconstruction and expansion of the drainage system and new emergency-notification technology that officials said would make Richmond ready for future storms. Beginning in 2006, the city had spent $1.9&nbsp;million on projects to mitigate the impact of major rainfalls. The city had also stepped up the frequency of its inspections and cleanings of the existing drain system, and has installed a new flash flood warning system.

$8.7&nbsp;million was spent to help the victims of the storm, much of it from [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]]. <ref>[http://www.timesdispatch.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=RTD%2FMGArticle%2FRTD_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1031784713215&path=%21news%21special%21generic4&s=1058750351796]{{Dead link|date=March 2008}}</ref> In Shockoe Bottom, most of the buildings were rebuilt and most of the businesses were back up and running. Some business owners say that the relief came too late <ref>[http://www.timesdispatch.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=RTD%2FMGArticle%2FRTD_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1031781759770&path=%21news%21special%21generic4&s=1058750351796]{{Dead link|date=March 2008}}</ref> "''The city hasn't done anything to 17th Street. It's uglier than when the storm hit''," said one owner of a restaurant that was destroyed in the storm that dropped about a foot of water on downtown Richmond. "''It's still a disaster area.''" {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

This sparked criticism of the city government in response to Hurricane Gaston. Many complained about potholes lining the roads, brick sidewalks that were a mess, and faded crosswalks. Also, because of poor drainage, streets are covered with a thick layer of silt and because of the lack of trash cans, storm debris is everywhere.

Even a year later, some of the damage from Gaston still lingered.

Hundreds of people were asking officials of how to recover their homes and businesses wrecked by Gaston in an area the city hopes will drive its economic growth. People wanted to know if their buildings had been condemned and what that meant and they wanted to know when they could return and whether the mud was toxic. They wanted to know whether to pay that month's rent on a building that may no longer be habitable. Some of their questions were answered while others were left unanswered.

===Lack of retirement===
Despite its effects, the name Gaston was not retired and will be used again in the 2010 season.
