'''''You're Whole''''' is an American satirical television series created by [[Michael Ian Black]] for [[Adult Swim]].
The show parodies [[self-help]] [[infomercial]]s and stars Black as the host, Randall Tyree Mandersohn.
In it, Mandersohn advertises his systems of objects and actions designed to help people with their issues.
It was the production of [[Abominable Pictures]], with which Black originally consulted with the premise of the show in mind.
Meanwhile, [[Michael Showalter]], longtime collaborator of Black, served as the director.

The show originally ran from November 5, 2012 to December 2, 2013, airing two seasons and totaling eight episodes.
Both seasons were broadcast at 4:00&nbsp;a.m. as part of ''DVR Theater'' on Adult Swim.
On air, it was promoted as a series of genuine infomercials.
Critical reception was positive, with many praising Black's performance.
A live performance was held at the 2014 ''[[SF Sketchfest]]'', also positively received.

''You're Whole'' is presented as a parody of [[self-help]] [[infomercial]]s.<ref name="West 2012" />
Each episode is advertised as part of a larger DVD set, consisting of 27 discs.
The show features [[Michael Ian Black]] as the host, Randall Tyree Mandersohn: a "totally blind", volleyball-obsessed, self-help guru.
Along with his wife, Pam ([[Cathy Shim]]), Mandersohn aims to help people using his bizarre, convoluted systems of objects and actions.
The show was directed by [[Michael Showalter]], a longtime collaborator of Black.<ref name="Adams 2012" />
Actor [[Crista Flanagan]] indicated that the second season was filmed as recently as August 2013.<ref name="Flanagan 2013" />

In a June 2014 interview with the ''[[Detroit Metro Times]]'', Brown stated that no further seasons would be produced.
Writing retrospectively the amount of research put into the show, Black stated that he "didn't spend a lot of time thinking about it", as it would have spoiled the "some of the stupidity", joking that "I'm nothing if not stupid".<ref name="Detroit Metro Times 2014" />
[[Abominable Pictures]] producer David Soldinger later wrote that Brown had come to the company with the idea in mind, and that, with their other parody infomercial ''Swords, Knives, Very Sharp Objects and Cutlery'', "it was a happy marriage" between their company and [[Adult Swim]].<ref name="Adams 2015" />

===Live performance===
A live performance of the show was given at the 2014 ''[[SF Sketchfest]]'' on January 31.<ref name="SF Sketchfest 2014" />
In addition to acting, Black and Showalter interlaced it with clips from the show.
Art Siriwatt of ''[[The Daily Californian]]'' observed Showalter to be the "[[Straight man (stock character)|straight man]]" to Black's antics, with both frequently breaking character.
He gave the performance a positive review, writing that "the result was a concise, lighthearted performance that was faithful to the show."<ref name="Siriwatt 2014" />

==Broadcast and reception==
The show premiered on November 5, 2012 on Adult Swim; two seasons have been broadcast, totaling eight episodes.<ref name="Zap2it and TV Guide" />
Advertised as a series of genuine infomercials, both seasons were broadcast at 4&nbsp;a.m., as part of the network's ''DVR Theater'' block.<ref name="Adult Swim Video 2012" />
The early-morning timeslot was chosen since infomercials usually air during such hours.<ref name="Detroit Metro Times 2014" />
The first episode was published on YouTube the day after its premiere.<ref name="West 2012" />
One critic<U+2014>Eliot Glazer of ''[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]''<U+2014>called the early morning time slot "terrible", directing readers toward online distribution.<ref name="Glazer 2012" />
Although the show premiered during a [[graveyard slot]] in U.S. [[dayparting]],<ref name="Nathanson 2013" /> nearly one million viewers (993,000) saw it on air.<ref name="Berman 2012a" />
The second season premiere marked a slight increase in viewers (996,000), while both maintained a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 0.7.<ref name="Pucci 2013a" />

Critical reception was positive, with many reviewers praising Black's performance and the satirizing of American self-help gurus, as conveyed through his casual racism and [[cultural appropriation]] of foreign rituals.<ref name="For ... (a)" /> Erik Adams of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' found that the show conveys itself "in a manner familiar to anyone who's ever killed time before daylight by flipping through their cable package."<ref name="Adams 2012" />
Britt Hayes of ''ScreenCrush'' called the show "absolutely fantastic" and Black's portrayal "spot-on".<ref name="Hayes 2012" /> Similarly, Aisha Harris of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote that Black's performance was "wonderfully committed", while the show "has pretty much every common trope of the self-help craze covered", citing the appropriation of foreign customs for Western audiences as "perhaps the most scathing treatment".<ref name="Harris 2012" />

Meanwhile, Kelly West of ''Television Blend'' highlighted some of the more surreal systems, calling the diet in the premiere episode "a winner".<ref name="West 2012" />
For ''[[Splitsider]]'', Bradford Evans dubbed the show "a more mainstream version"<ref name="Evans 2012" /> of ''[[Paid Programming (TV pilot)|Paid Programming]]'', an unsuccessful pilot that was also pitched as a mock-infomercial.
He found that starring Black, "recognizable as a comedic actor," would lead to its success, whereas the former preferred to use unknown actors instead.<ref name="Evans 2012" />
