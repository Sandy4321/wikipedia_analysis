'''William Henry Hunt''' (June 12, 1823 &ndash; February 27, 1884) was the [[United States Secretary of the Navy]] under President [[James Garfield]] and briefly under President [[Chester A. Arthur]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], Hunt studied law at [[Yale University|Yale]]. He finished his professional training in his brothers' office in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], where he was admitted to the bar in 1844. Hunt opposed [[secession]] and favored the Union cause. He was nevertheless drafted into the [[Confederate Army]] and commissioned [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]]. However, he managed to avoid involvement in military operations until Admiral [[David Farragut]] captured New Orleans.

In March 1876, Hunt was appointed Attorney-General of Louisiana, and in July of that year he was the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate for this office. Both parties claimed victory in the election, but Hunt lost the position when President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] recognized the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] government of the State. As compensation, the President appointed him Associate Judge of the [[United States Court of Claims]], May 15, 1878. He served in this capacity until he became President Garfield's Secretary of the Navy in 1881.

Secretary Hunt rendered invaluable service by reporting that the Navy, grossly neglected after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], was no longer able to protect Americans abroad. He appointed the first Naval Advisory Board which undertook the work of rebuilding the Navy, emasculated by public apathy and lack of funds. After Vice President Arthur succeeded Garfield in the presidency, he retired Hunt from the cabinet by appointing him [[List of United States Ambassadors to Russia|Minister to Russia]] on April 7, 1882. 

Hunt died February 27, 1884, while representing the United States at [[Saint Petersburg]], and is buried at [[Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Oak Hill Cemetery]] in Washington, D.C.

==Namesakes==
Two ships in the [[United States Navy]] have been named [[USS Hunt|USS ''Hunt'']] for him.
