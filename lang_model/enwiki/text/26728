'''Ricketts Glen State Park''' is a [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] on {{convert|13047|acre}} in [[Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Columbia]], [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne]], and [[Sullivan County, Pennsylvania|Sullivan]] counties in [[Pennsylvania]] in the United States. Ricketts Glen is a [[National Natural Landmark]] known for its [[old-growth forest]] and 24&nbsp;[[Waterfalls in Ricketts Glen State Park|named waterfalls]] along [[Kitchen Creek (Pennsylvania)|Kitchen Creek]], which flows down the [[Allegheny Front]] escarpment from the [[Allegheny Plateau]] to the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]]. The park is near the borough of [[Benton, Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Benton]] on [[Pennsylvania Route 118]] and [[Pennsylvania Route 487]], and is in five townships: [[Sugarloaf Township, Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Sugarloaf]] in Columbia County, [[Fairmount Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Fairmount]] and [[Ross Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Ross]] in Luzerne County, and [[Colley Township, Sullivan County, Pennsylvania|Colley]] and [[Davidson Township, Sullivan County, Pennsylvania|Davidson]] in Sullivan County.

Ricketts Glen's land was once home to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. From 1822 to 1827, a [[Toll road|turnpike]] was built along the course of PA 487 in what is now the park, where two [[squatter]]s harvested cherry trees to make [[bed frame]]s from about 1830 to 1860. The park's waterfalls were one of the main attractions for a hotel from 1873 to 1903; the park is named for the hotel's proprietor, [[R. Bruce Ricketts]], who built the trail along the waterfalls.  By the 1890s Ricketts owned or controlled over {{convert|80000|acre|km2 sqmi}} and made his fortune [[clearcutting]] almost all of that land, including much of what is now the park; however he preserved about {{convert|2000|acre}} of virgin forest in the creek's three [[glen]]s. The sawmill was at the village of [[Ricketts, Pennsylvania|Ricketts]], which was mostly north of the park. After his death in 1918, Ricketts' heirs began selling land to the state for [[Pennsylvania State Game Lands]].

Plans to make Ricketts Glen a national park in the 1930s were ended by budget issues and the [[Second World War]]; Pennsylvania began purchasing the land in 1942 and fully opened Ricketts Glen State Park in 1944. The [[Benton Air Force Station]], a [[Cold War]] [[radar]] installation in the park, operated from 1951 to 1975 and still serves as airport radar for nearby [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] and as the [[Red Rock Job Corps Center]]. Improvements since the creation of the state park include a new dam for the {{convert|245|acre|0|sing=on}} Lake Jean, the breaching of two other dams Ricketts built, trail modifications, and a [[fire tower]]. In 1999 [[Hurricane Floyd]] briefly closed the park and downed thousands of trees; helicopter logging protected the ecosystem while harvesting [[lumber]] worth nearly $7&nbsp;million, some of which paid for a new park office in 2001.

The park offers hiking, ten cabins, camping (one of the two camping areas is on a peninsula in the lake), horseback riding, and hunting. Lake Jean is used for swimming, fishing, canoeing and kayaking. In winter there is [[cross-country skiing]], ice fishing on the lake, and [[ice climbing]] on the frozen falls. The Glens Natural Area has eight named waterfalls in Glen Leigh and ten in Ganoga Glen, these come together at Waters Meet; downstream in Ricketts Glen there are four to six named waterfalls. The park has four rock formations from the [[Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]] periods, and is home to a wide variety of plants and animals. It was named an [[Important Bird Area]] by the Pennsylvania [[Audubon Society]] and is an Important Mammal Area too. Ricketts Glen State Park was chosen by the [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]] (DCNR) and its [[Pennsylvania Bureau of State Parks|Bureau of State Parks]] as one of "Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks".<ref name =mustsee>{{cite web| url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/twenty/20parks.aspx | title = Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks | accessdate = August 8, 2007 | publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources}} ''Note'': Despite the title, there are twenty-one parks in the list, with [[Colton Point State Park|Colton Point]] and [[Leonard Harrison State Park]] treated as one.''</ref>

Ricketts Glen State Park is in Pennsylvania, where humans have lived since at least 10000&nbsp;BC. The first settlers in the state were [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]] [[nomad]]ic hunters known from their [[stone tool]]s.<ref name = prehistory>Kent, Smith, McCann, pp. 4, 7<U+2013>11, 85<U+2013>96, 195<U+2013>201.</ref><ref name = indians>Wallace (2005), pp. 4<U+2013>12, 84<U+2013>89, 99<U+2013>105, 145<U+2013>148, 157<U+2013>164.</ref> The [[hunter-gatherer]]s of the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]], which lasted locally from 7000 to 1000&nbsp;BC, used a greater variety of more sophisticated stone artifacts. The [[Woodland period]] marked the gradual transition to semi-permanent villages and [[horticulture]], between 1000&nbsp;BC and 1500&nbsp;AD. Archeological evidence found in the state from this time includes a range of pottery types and styles, [[tumulus|burial mounds]], pipes, bows and arrows, and ornaments.<ref name = prehistory/>

The park is in the [[Susquehanna River]] drainage basin, the earliest recorded inhabitants of which were the [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Susquehannock]]s. They were a [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] society that lived in [[stockade]]d villages of large [[longhouse]]s, but their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the [[Iroquois]], and by 1675&nbsp;they had died out, moved away, or been [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] into other tribes.<ref name = indians/><ref name = donehoo/>

After the demise of the Susquehannocks, the lands of the Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who also lived in longhouses, primarily in what is now the state of [[New York]]. The Iroquois had a strong [[confederation|confederacy]] which gave them power beyond their numbers.<ref name = indians/><ref name=path>Wallace (1987), pp. 66<U+2013>72, 130<U+2013>132.</ref> To fill the void left by the demise of the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle in the Susquehanna watershed, including the [[Shawnee]] and [[Lenape]] (or Delaware).<ref name = indians/><ref name =donehoo>Donehoo, pp. 154<U+2013>155, 215<U+2013>219.</ref>

The [[French and Indian War]] (1754<U+2013>1763) and subsequent colonial expansion encouraged the migration of many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] westward to the [[Ohio River]] basin.<ref name = indians/> On November 5, 1768, the British acquired land, known in Pennsylvania as the New Purchase, from the Iroquois in the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]]; this included what is now Ricketts Glen State Park.<ref>Wallace (2005), p. 159.</ref> After the [[American Revolutionary War]], Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania.<ref>Wallace (2005), pp. 136<U+2013>141.</ref> About 1890 a Native American pot, decorated in the style of "the peoples of the Susquehanna region", was found under a rock ledge on Kitchen Creek by Murray Reynolds, for whom a waterfall is named.<ref>Wren, p. 56, Plate No. 7.</ref>

Ricketts Glen State Park is in five [[Township (Pennsylvania)|townships]] in three counties. After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of [[Northumberland County, Pennsylvania|Northumberland County]], but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in [[Fairmount Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Fairmount Township]], which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in [[Ross Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Ross Township]], which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/counties/pdfs/Luzerne.pdf |title = Luzerne County 3rd class |accessdate = April 6, 2010 | format = PDF | publisher = [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]]}}</ref> The northwest part of the park is in [[Sullivan County, Pennsylvania|Sullivan County]], which was formed in 1847 from [[Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Lycoming County]]; [[Davidson Township, Sullivan County, Pennsylvania|Davidson Township]] was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while [[Colley Township, Sullivan County, Pennsylvania|Colley Township]], which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/counties/pdfs/Sullivan.pdf |title = Sullivan County 8th class |accessdate = April 6, 2010 | format = PDF | publisher = Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission}}</ref><ref name = "petrillo 40"/> A small part of the southwest part of the park is in [[Sugarloaf Township, Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Sugarloaf Township]] in [[Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Columbia County]]; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/counties/pdfs/Columbia.pdf |title = Columbia County 6th class |accessdate = April 6, 2010 | format = PDF | publisher = Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission}}</ref><ref>Richter, pp. 3<U+2013>46.</ref>

A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than {{convert|0.4|mi|1}} northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga [[toll road|Turnpike]], which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of [[Berwick, Pennsylvania|Berwick]] in the south and [[Towanda, Pennsylvania|Towanda]] in the north. The turnpike, which [[Pennsylvania Route 487]] mostly follows through the park, had daily [[stagecoach]] service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.<ref name = "petrillo 40">Petrillo, pp. 40<U+2013>43.</ref><ref name =HABS>Ricketts, pp. 2<U+2013>6.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url =http://www.bentonnews.net/Features/turnpikewilson.htm | title = Sketches from the Susquehanna-Tioga Turnpike | first = Kenneth T. | last = Wilson, Jr. | journal= Carver Magazine |volume= 8 |issue= 1 |date=  Spring, 1990 | accessdate = February 18, 2010 }}</ref>

The earliest settlers in what became the park were two [[squatting|squatters]] who built [[sawmill]]s to make [[bed frame]]s from cherry trees they cut for lumber. One squatter, Jesse Dodson, cut trees from around 1830 to 1860 and built a mill and the dam for what became Lake Rose in 1842. Dodson also built a dam south of Mud Pond, near what became Lake Jean; both dams were on the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek, and each was used to make a "log splash pond".<ref name = "petrillo 68"/><ref name = IBA48/> The other squatter, named Sickler, also built a mill and log dam, at what became Lake Leigh on the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek. Sickler was active from 1838 to about 1860.<ref name = HABS/><ref name = "petrillo 68">Petrillo, p. 68.</ref>

In 1865, a well was drilled at the Dodson mill site, after a Mr. Hadley fraudulently added oil to [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] in what became the park. Hadley, who had hoped that investors would think [[petroleum]] was present, got the [[Wheeler & Wilson]] sewing machine company to invest $40,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|40000|1865|r=-4}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) in his scheme. In the next two years they drilled two wells, one {{convert|2100|ft}} deep at the former Dodson sawmill at Lake Rose and the other {{convert|1900|ft}} deep near the Ricketts mansion. No oil was ever found, and Hadley eventually fled to Canada.<ref name=HABS/><ref>Tomasak, p. 44</ref><ref name = inflation/>

While on a hunting trip on [[Loyalsock Creek]] north of the park in 1850, brothers Elijah and Clemuel Ricketts were frustrated at having to spend the night on a hotel's parlor floor. In 1851 or 1853 they bought {{convert|5000|acre}}, including what is now Lake Ganoga and some of the park, as their own hunting preserve, and built a [[Clemuel Ricketts Mansion|stone house]] on the lake shore by 1852 or 1855.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} The stone house served as their lodge and as a tavern; it was known as "Ricketts Folly" for its isolated location in the wilderness. Clemuel died in 1858 and Elijah bought his share of the land and house. The Ricketts family was not aware of the glens and their waterfalls until about 1865, when they were discovered by two guests from the stone house who went fishing and wandered down Kitchen Creek.<ref name = "petrillo 40"/><ref name=HABS>{{cite web | url = http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=hhdatapage&fileName=pa/pa1200/pa1250/data/hhdatapage.db&recNum=0&itemLink=r?ammem/hh:@FIELD(DOCID+@BAND(@lit(PA1250))) | title = William R.

Elijah's son [[R. Bruce Ricketts|Robert Bruce Ricketts]], for whom the park is named, joined the [[Union Army]] as a private at the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] and rose through the ranks to become a colonel in the artillery. After the war, R. Bruce Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and in 1869 began purchasing the land around the lake from his father. By 1873 he controlled or owned {{convert|66000|acre}}, and eventually this grew to more than {{convert|80000|acre}}, including the glens and waterfalls and most of the park.<ref name =rgsp/><ref name = "petrillo 40"/><ref name = HABS/>

While the stone house had served as a home and inn since its construction, in 1872 R. Bruce Ricketts built a three-story wooden addition north of the house. The addition used lumber from a [[sawmill]] Ricketts and his partners operated from 1872 to 1875, about {{convert|0.5|mi|1}} southeast of the stone house. The North Mountain House hotel opened in 1873; Ricketts' brother Frank, for whom a waterfall is named, managed it from then until 1898. Many of the hotel's guests were Ricketts' friends and relations, who arrived after school let out in June and stayed all summer until school resumed in September. In 1876 and 1877, Ricketts ran the first summer school in the United States at his house and hotel; one of the teachers was [[Joseph Rothrock]], later known as the "Father of Forestry" in Pennsylvania.<ref name = "petrillo 40"/><ref name =HABS/><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/forestry/stateforests/rothhistory.aspx |title = History of the Rothrock State Forest |accessdate = February 5, 2010 |publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources}}</ref>

The waterfalls and Ganoga Lake were the hotel's biggest attractions. By 1875 Ricketts had named the tallest waterfall Ganoga Falls; he eventually named 22 of the waterfalls. Ricketts gave most of them Native American names, and named others for relatives and friends.<ref name = "petrillo 40"/><ref name=HABS/><ref name = bachelder>Bachelder, pp. 186<U+2013>189.</ref><ref>Tomasak, p. 85.</ref> Ricketts renamed Long Pond as Ganoga Lake in 1881.

===Lumber era===

For over 20&nbsp;years, Ricketts was "land poor"; he owed much on the mortgages on his vast land holdings, and there were no good means to transport the estimated {{convert|1400000000|board feet|lk=on}} of lumber from most of his land to sawmills. Large-scale lumber operations of that time floated logs on major streams or used logging railroads, but neither was available to Ricketts.  His small sawmill near the stone house closed by 1875, and he was only able to sell two major tracts of land in his lifetime. In 1872 he sold {{convert|14000|acre}} north of the park to a group of investors that included himself; this deal seems to have been for shares of stock (not cash), and the deed for the sale was not recorded until 1893. Ricketts sold {{convert|13000|acre}} along [[Bowman Creek]], including the easternmost parts of the park, to Albert Lewis in 1876; Lewis hoped to build a branch line of the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] along the creek. In the 1870s and 1880s, Ricketts tried repeatedly and unsuccessfully to find partners and investors who would help him cut the lumber on his land and build a rail line to it.<ref>Petrillo, pp. 43<U+2013>49.</ref>

Finally in 1890, [[Harry Clay Trexler]], J.H. Turrell, Ricketts, and partners formed the Trexler and Turrell Lumber Company and leased {{convert|5000|acre}} of Ricketts' land near Ganoga Lake. The company built a sawmill and lumber town named [[Ricketts, Pennsylvania|Ricketts]] on [[Mehoopany Creek]]. The town, which was in both Sullivan and [[Wyoming County, Pennsylvania|Wyoming]] counties, had 800&nbsp;inhabitants at its peak and extended into the northernmost section of the park. Rail lines were built to the mills at Ricketts, including the Bowman Creek branch of the Lehigh Valley Railroad which opened in 1983, and also provided passenger service to the hotel on Lake Ganoga.<ref>Petrillo, pp. 43<U+2013>49, 68.</ref><ref name = ghosttown>{{cite news| url = http://www.sungazette.com/page/content.detail/id/517582.html?showlayout=0 | title = Ghost town of Ricketts brought back to life by state park educator | first = Jessica | last = Lamey-Welshans | date = October 26, 2008 | work = [[Williamsport Sun-Gazette]] | accessdate = May 5, 2010 }}</ref> According to Petrillo's ''Ghost Towns of North Mountain: Ricketts, Mountain Springs, Stull'': "Ricketts was on the verge of financial disaster for two decades until the Lehigh Valley Railroad was constructed through his lands."<ref>Petrillo, p. 3.</ref>

Trexler and Turrell paid Ricketts $50,000 in both 1890 and 1891, and continued to cut his land and pay him for the timber until 1913. By 1911, the main sawmill at Ricketts could cut {{convert|125000|board feet}} a day and was supported by three locomotives with 62&nbsp;cars on {{convert|22|mi}} of track. Within the park, the area around what became Lake Jean was cut in the 1890s, and Cherry Ridge (east of [[Red Rock Job Corps Center]]) and land around Lake Leigh were the last areas cut by the Ricketts mill. Timber in the east part of the park and along Bowman Creek was cut by Lewis' company, which also used logging railroads and even ran track down the Allegheny Front at Phillips Creek.<ref>Petrillo, pp. 66, 68.</ref><ref>Taber, pp. 344<U+2013>351, 365.</ref> Lewis' firm built a [[splash dam]] on Bowman Creek to help float logs downstream in 1891, then used the lake to [[ice cutting|cut ice]] for refrigeration.

Within a decade of the railroad reaching his lands, Ricketts was out of the hotel business. The North Mountain House hotel was threatened by a forest fire in 1900; the subsequent loss of much of the surrounding old-growth forest led to decreased numbers of hotel guests. Changing tastes may have also played a role in the decline in popularity; the hotel had over 150 guests in August 1878, but only about 70 guests in August 1894.<ref>Tomasak, pp. 88, 323, 326, 328<U+2013>329.</ref> The wooden addition was torn down in 1897 or 1903,{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} and "despite profits, Ricketts became disenchanted with the hotel business and closed his hotel in 1903", though the stone house remained the Ricketts family's summer home.<ref name =nrhp>{{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H000623_01H.pdf | title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Clemuel Ricketts Mansion | accessdate = April 11, 2010 | author = McDonald, Teresa B.

Not all of Ricketts' plans were financially successful; between 1905 and 1907 he built three dams to generate [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] within what became the park, forming Lake Leigh at the site of Sickler's mill, Lake Rose at the site of Dodson's mill, and Lake Jean (which incorporated the natural Mud Pond) north of these.

The state's original plans for the new park included building an inn, an 18-hole golf course and [[country club]], and a winter sports complex for skiing, [[ice boat]]ing, and [[toboggan]]ing, as well as a beach with bathing facilities, cabins, and a tent camping area. Only the last three were actually built, all south of Lake Jean; the Hayfield area north of Lake Jean was to have had the facilities for golf and tennis, and the inn and winter sports complex were to have been atop Cherry Ridge, at an elevation of {{convert|2461|ft}}.<ref name = "tomasak 373">Tomasak, pp. 373<U+2013>374.</ref><ref name ="Cherry Ridge">{{cite web | work = [[Geographic Names Information System]] | publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]] | date = August 2, 1979 | url ={{Gnis3|1171653}} | title = Cherry Ridge | accessdate = July 22, 2010 }}</ref>

A 1947 newspaper article estimated that the new park would have 50,000&nbsp;visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added. Out of concern for greater safety, [[footbridge]]s with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. In the southern end of the new park, the state built the Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls,<ref name = "sun"/> as well as a new parking area for 200&nbsp;cars and a concession stand, both along [[Pennsylvania Route 118]] (PA 118).<ref name = "tomasak 373"/>

The state made other improvements in the park, including replacing or removing all of Ricketts' dams. At Lake Jean it built an earthen dam in 1949<U+2013>1950 to replace Ricketts' 1905 timber dam; the new dam increased the size of Lake Jean to {{convert|245|acre}} and its eastern end now included the former Mud Pond. On April 20, 1958, the 1907 concrete dam at Lake Leigh developed a hole, causing [[Pennsylvania State Police]] to evacuate close to 2,000&nbsp;people from the park. Engineers from the state inspected the dam and made a second breach in the dam near ground level, draining the lake. The resulting flow of water destroyed some of the hiking paths in Glen Leigh and the fish [[fish stocking|stocked]] in the lake wound up in Kitchen Creek. The Lake Jean dam was repaired in 1956. The last of Ricketts' dams, at Lake Rose, was breached in 1959 after remnants of a hurricane filled the lake to capacity. The rest of the 1905 dam was removed in 1969.<ref name = "petrillo 68"/><ref name = "IBA48"/><ref>Tomasak, p. 377.</ref> At Grand View the state built a wooden [[fire tower]] at the site of Ricketts' earlier observation tower, then replaced it with a {{convert|100|ft|adj=on}} steel tower.

Ricketts Glen State Park covers two different [[physiographic province]]s: the [[Allegheny Plateau]] in the north, and the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]] in the south. The boundary between these is a steep [[escarpment]] known as the [[Allegheny Front]], which rises up to {{convert|1200|ft}} above the land to the south. Within the park, Kitchen Creek has its [[Source (river or stream)|headwaters]] on the [[dissected plateau]], then drops approximately {{convert|1000|ft}} down the Allegheny Front in  {{convert|2.25|mi}}. Much of this drop occurs in Glen Leigh and Ganoga Glen, two narrow valleys carved by branches of Kitchen Creek, which come together at Waters Meet. Ricketts Glen lies south of and downstream from Waters Meet, and here the terrain becomes less steep. There are [[Waterfalls in Ricketts Glen State Park|24 named waterfalls]] in the three glens.<ref name= "dcnr map">{{cite map |publisher= Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources |title= Ricketts Glen State Park |url= http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateParks/parks/rickettsglen/rickettsglen_mini.pdf |edition= |date= July 2006 |scale= 1<U+215B> inch = <U+00BD> mile |accessdate=November 14, 2009 | format = PDF }} Note:This is a map on one side giving 22&nbsp;waterfall names and heights (available at the URL cited) and a park guide on the other side.</ref><ref name="rggeology"/><ref name = "brown 50">Brown, pp. 50<U+2013>52.</ref>

The rocks exposed in the park were formed in the [[Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]] periods between 370&nbsp;and 340&nbsp;million years ago, when the land was part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a build-up of [[sediment]] made up primarily of [[clay]], [[sand]] and [[gravel]].
Tremendous pressure caused the formation of the sedimentary rocks that are found in the park and in the Kitchen Creek [[drainage basin]]: [[sandstone]], [[shale]], [[siltstone]], and [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]].<ref name="rggeology"/>

There are four distinct rock formations within Ricketts Glen State Park. The most recent and highest of these is the late [[Mississippian]] [[Mauch Chunk Formation]], composed of "grayish-red shale, siltstone, sandstone, and some conglomerate".<ref name="usgs luzerne">{{cite web | title = Geologic units in Luzerne county, Pennsylvania | url = http://tin.er.usgs.gov/geology/state/fips-unit.php?code=f42079 | date = February 11, 2010 | publisher = United States Geological Survey | accessdate = April 3, 2010}}</ref> This forms the highest points on the Allegheny Plateau and is found north of Lake Jean, forming the land beneath the Red Rocks Job Corps Center and Cherry Ridge to the east. The next formation below this is the Mississippian [[Pocono Formation]], which is buff or gray sandstone with  conglomerate and siltstone inclusions. This forms most of the Allegheny Plateau and underlies the park office, Lake Jean and the former Lakes Rose and Leigh. The boulders of the Midway Crevasse, which the Highland Trail passes through, are Pocono Formation sandstone.<ref name = "rggeology"/><ref name="usgs luzerne"/>

Green vegetation surrounds the falls, with large tree trunks at the base of the falls.|F.L. Ricketts Falls is a wedding cake type waterfall, cascading {{convert|38|ft}} over [[Huntley Mountain Formation]] rock.]]
The third of the rock formations within the park is the [[Huntley Mountain Formation]], from the late Devonian and early [[Mississippian]]. This is made of layers of olive green to gray sandstone and gray to red shale. The Huntley Mountain Formation is relatively hard and erosion resistant. It caps the Allegheny Front and has kept it from eroding as much as the softer [[Catskill Formation]], to the south. The Catskill Formation is the lowest and oldest layer in the park, and is composed of red shale and siltstone up to 370&nbsp;million years old. The Allegheny Front within the park is named North Mountain and [[Red Rock Mountain]], with the latter name coming from an exposed band of Huntley Formation red shale and sandstone visible along [[Pennsylvania Route 487]] (PA 487).<ref name="rggeology"/><ref name = "roadside">Van Diver, pp. 31<U+2013>35, 153<U+2013>155.</ref><ref name="map 61">{{cite web| url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/map61/redrock.pdf | title = Atlas of Preliminary Geologic Quadrangle Maps of Pennsylvania: Red Rock | accessdate = June 8, 2009 | author = Berg, T.

Geologists and the official Ricketts Glen State Park web page classify the falls at Ricketts Glen State Park into two types. [[Wedding cake|Wedding-cake]] falls descend in a series of small steps. Within the park, this type of falls usually flows over thin layers of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone. In [[veil|bridal-veil]] falls, the second type, water falls over a ledge and drops vertically into a [[plunge pool]] in the stream bed below. Within the park, this type of falls flows over Catskill Formation rocks or the red shale and sandstone of the Huntley Formation. In the park, the harder [[caprock]] which forms the ledge from which the bridal-veil falls drops is gray sandstone. The softer red shale below is eroded away by water, sand and gravel to form the plunge pool.<ref name=rgsp/><ref name="rggeology"/> Brown's ''Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers'' uses four types to classify waterfalls: falls, cascade, slide, and chute.<ref name= "brown xiv">Brown, p. xiv</ref>

About 300&nbsp;to 250&nbsp;million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all formed in the [[Alleghenian orogeny]]. This happened long after the [[sedimentary rock]]s in the park were deposited, when the part of [[Gondwana]] that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming [[Pangaea]]. In the years since, up to 5,000&nbsp;feet (1,500&nbsp;m) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor in shaping the land that makes up the park today.<ref name = "rggeology"/><ref name = "roadside"/><ref name = "geology book">Shultz, pp. 372<U+2013>374, 391, 399, 818.</ref>

The effects of glaciation have made Kitchen Creek within the park "unique compared to all other nearby streams that flow down the Allegheny Front", as it is the only one with an "almost continuous series of waterfalls".<ref name="rggeology">{{cite web | url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/parkguides/pg13.pdf | title = Pennsylvania Trail of Geology, Ricketts Glen State Park, Luzerne, Sullivan and Columbia Counties, The Rocks, the Glens and the Falls (Park Guide 13) |author = Braun, Duane D.; Inners, Jon D.|accessdate = November 29, 2009 | publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources |format= PDF}}</ref> Before the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]], Kitchen Creek had a much smaller drainage basin; during the ice age, glaciers covered all of the park except the Grand View outcrop. About 20,000&nbsp;years ago the glaciers retreated to the northeast and [[glacial lake]]s formed. Drainage from the melting glacier and lakes cut a sluiceway, or channel, that diverted the headwaters of [[Bowman Creek|South Branch Bowman Creek]] into the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek. Glacial deposits of debris {{convert|20|to|30|ft}} thick formed a dam blocking water from [[Ganoga Lake]] and what became Lake Jean from draining into Big Run, a tributary of [[Fishing Creek (North Branch Susquehanna River)|Fishing Creek]]. The water was instead diverted into the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek.<ref name ="rggeology"/>

These diversions added about {{convert|7|sqmi}} to the Kitchen Creek drainage basin, increasing it by just over 50&nbsp;percent.<ref name ="rggeology"/><ref>{{cite book  | last = Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection  | coauthors = Bureau of Watershed Management, Division of Water Use Planning  | others = Prepared in Cooperation with the United States Department of the Interior Geological Survey| title = Pennsylvania Gazetteer of Streams | format = PDF  | url = http://www.lycoming.edu/biologydept/petokas/pa%20gazzetter%20of%20streams.pdf | accessdate = December 5, 2009 | year = 2001}}</ref> The result was increased water flow in Kitchen Creek, which has been cutting the falls in the glens since. The gradient or slope of Kitchen Creek was fairly stable for its flow when it had a much smaller drainage basin, as Phillips Creek to the east still does. Kitchen Creek is now too steep for its present amount of water flow, and over time erosion will decrease the creek's slope and make it less steep.<ref name="rggeology"/> There are rocks with [[glacial striation]]s visible within the park.<ref name = pcn>{{cite video | title = PCN Tours Pennsylvania State Parks: Ricketts Glen State Park | url = http://www.pcntv.com/stateparks.html |accessdate = May 29, 2010 | publisher = [[Pennsylvania Cable Network]] | people =Emenheiser, David (Director) | format = DVD | date =  August 7, 2007 }}</ref>

[[Ornithologist]]s and bird watchers have recorded a total of 75&nbsp;species at Ricketts Glen State Park and within the IBA. Several factors contribute to the high total of bird species observed: there is a large area of forest in the park, as well as great habitat diversity. The location of the IBA along the Allegheny Front also contributes to the diverse bird populations.<ref name="IBA48"/> The IBA is said to be the "largest extant forest" in northeastern Pennsylvania and one of the largest forests in the state of Pennsylvania.<ref name="IBA48"/> The North Mountain IBA has officially been adopted by the North Branch Bird Club and is "well-known" by members of the Greater Wyoming Valley Audubon, Valley Forge Audubon, and the Pennsylvania Society for Ornithology.<ref name="IBA48"/>

Ricketts Glen State Park provides a breeding habitat for four species of [[Empidonax|flycatchers]] and two species of [[Seiurus|waterthrushes]]. [[American Bittern]] nest near the park. [[Bald Eagle]] are frequent visitors to the park, and some ornithologists believe they may be nesting there since adult pairs have been observed with their young.<ref name="IBA48"/> The park is a nesting location for three "rare" birds, including two [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] (the [[Northern Goshawk]] and [[Hen Harrier|Northern Harrier]]), and [[Swainson's Thrush]], as well as one "at risk" [[duck]], the [[Green-winged Teal]].<ref name="IBA48"/>

Ricketts Glen State Park has extensive acreage of "interior forest" that is far from open space; several bird species that are area-sensitive are found within these forests in the park, including the [[Black-throated Green Warbler]], [[Red-eyed Vireo]], [[Dark-eyed Junco]] and [[Black-capped Chickadee]]. Two species of [[owl]], [[Barred Owl|Barred]] and [[Northern Saw-whet Owl|Northern Saw-whet]], inhabit the deep forests.<ref name="IBA48"/> The hemlock forests of the glens are home to the [[Louisiana Waterthrush]], [[Acadian Flycatcher]], [[Blackburnian Warbler]], [[Blue-headed Vireo]], [[Magnolia Warbler]], [[Brown Creeper]], [[Golden-crowned Kinglet]] and [[Winter Wren]].<ref name="IBA48"/> [[Wood Thrush]] are found in the lower elevations of the park and are replaced within the ecosystem by [[Hermit Thrush]] at the higher elevations.<ref name="IBA48"/> The [[Canada Warbler]] and [[Black-throated Blue Warbler]] are on several watchlists, but are common within the park. The Canada Warbler inhabits [[blueberry]] thickets with [[White-throated Sparrow]], while the Black-throated Blue Warbler is found in the forests atop the plateau with the [[Least Flycatcher]].<ref name="IBA48"/> [[Common Raven]] are regularly seen soaring over the forests of the park looking for [[carrion]]. [[Canada Goose]] are present in the park and have been classified as a "pest" due to their high numbers and the large amount of fecal waste they leave on the shores of Lake Jean.<ref name="IBA48"/> Ricketts Glen's forests also support populations of  [[Nashville Warbler|Nashville]] and [[Yellow-rumped Warbler]]s, [[Yellow-bellied Sapsucker]], [[Red-breasted Nuthatch]], and [[Purple Finch]].<ref name="IBA48"/>
