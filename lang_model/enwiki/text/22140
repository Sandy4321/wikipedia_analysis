'''U.S. Route 219''' ('''US&nbsp;219''') is a part of the [[U.S. Highway System]] that runs from [[Rich Creek, Virginia]] to [[West Seneca, New York]].  In the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maryland]], the federal highway runs {{convert|48.40|mi|km}} from the [[West Virginia]] state line near [[Red House, Maryland|Red House]] to the [[Pennsylvania]] state line near [[Grantsville, Maryland|Grantsville]].  Known as Garrett Highway for much of its length in Maryland, US&nbsp;219 is the primary north&ndash;south route in [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett County]], connecting [[Interstate 68]] (I-68) and [[Oakland, Maryland|Oakland]].  The federal highway also provides the main access to the resort area of [[Deep Creek Lake]], which includes Maryland's only ski area, [[Wisp Ski Resort]].  US&nbsp;219 is part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] for its entire length in Maryland.<ref name="National Highway System"/>

The part of US&nbsp;219 between Oakland and [[Keyser's Ridge, Maryland|Keyser's Ridge]] was designated as part of the original state road system in 1909 by the Maryland State Roads Commission and constructed in the early 1910s.  Chestnut Ridge Road near Grantsville was upgraded to a modern road in the late 1910s, while the [[Seneca Trail]] south of Oakland was mostly built in the 1920s.  The US&nbsp;219 designation was assigned to Chestnut Ridge Road and Maryland Route 37 (MD&nbsp;37) was assigned to the highway south of Keyser's Ridge when federal and state route numbers were assigned in 1927.  The intersection with [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|US&nbsp;40]] near Grantsville was the southern terminus of US&nbsp;219 until the federal highway was extended through West Virginia in 1935.  US&nbsp;219 was almost completely rebuilt in the 1940s and 1950s, and moved onto I-68 in the mid 1970s.  Future plans call for a bypass of Oakland and construction of freeway north from I-68 to connect with other freeway portions of US&nbsp;219 in Pennsylvania.

==Route description==
US&nbsp;219 enters Maryland in the southwest corner of Garrett County just to the west of [[Backbone Mountain]].<ref name="Google Maps US 219 in MD"/>  The federal highway heads northeast from the West Virginia state line as two-lane Garrett Highway.<ref name="Garrett HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps US 219 in MD"/>  After crossing the [[Youghiogheny River]], US 219 meets [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|US&nbsp;50]] (George Washington Highway) at an intersection with a two-way stop in the hamlet of Red House.<ref name="Garrett HLR"/>  The federal highway turns northwest to intersect Ben Dewitt Road, a shortcut between US&nbsp;219 north and US&nbsp;50 west, then resumes its northeast heading toward [[Gortner, Maryland|Gortner]], where the highway crosses Cherry Creek and passes Mason School Road.<ref name="Google Maps US 219 in MD"/>  US&nbsp;219 turns north and crosses the Little Youghiogheny River and [[CSX Transportation|CSX]]'s [[Mountain Subdivision]] before entering Oakland and meeting the west end of [[Maryland Route 135|MD&nbsp;135]] (Maryland Highway).  The federal highway turns west onto Oak Street, while Ninth Street continues straight along the alignment of the future Oakland Bypass.<ref name="Garrett HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps US 219 in MD"/>  US&nbsp;219 continues west into the [[Oakland Historic District (Oakland, Maryland)|Oakland Historic District]].<ref name="Garrett HLR"/>  At the intersection with [[Maryland Route 39|MD&nbsp;39]] (Oak Street) next to the [[Garrett County Courthouse]], the federal highway turns north onto Third Street.<ref name="Garrett HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps US 219 in MD"/>  US&nbsp;219 leaves the town limits of Oakland and regains the name Garrett Highway north of the [[Walmart|Walmart Supercenter]], where the Oakland Bypass is expected to rejoin the current alignment.<ref name="Garrett HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps US 219 in MD"/>

After leaving Oakland, US&nbsp;219 passes to the east of Mount Nebo and meets the northern end of Sand Flat Road.<ref name="Google Maps US 219 in MD"/>  The federal highway passes Mayhew Inn Road as US&nbsp;219 enters the hamlet of [[Thayerville, Maryland|Thayerville]] and the Deep Creek Lake resort area.<ref name="Garrett HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps US 219 in MD"/>  After passing Glendale Road, which heads east toward [[Deep Creek Lake State Park]] and other destinations on the east side of the lake, the federal highway turns northwest and parallels the west shore of the lake.  After passing Lakeshore Drive, US&nbsp;219 crosses the lake on the Deep Creek Bridge.<ref name="Google Maps US 219 in MD"/>  The federal highway becomes a partially controlled access highway on the hillside above the lake, while Deep Creek Drive, the old alignment of US&nbsp;219, follows the shore and provides access to vacation homes.<ref name="Garrett HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps US 219 in MD"/>  US&nbsp;219 parallels Marsh Run Cove north into a commercial area in the unincorporated village of [[McHenry, Maryland|McHenry]].  In McHenry, the federal highway intersects Mosser Road, which provides access to [[Garrett College]] and [[Garrett County Airport]], and Sang Run Road, which leads to Wisp Ski Resort.  After meeting the northern end of Deep Creek Drive, [[Maryland Route 42|MD&nbsp;42]] (Friendsville Road) splits to the north and the federal highway re-enters rural areas.<ref name="Google Maps US 219 in MD"/>  US&nbsp;219 continues northeast, crossing the South Branch of Bear Creek before entering the town of [[Accident, Maryland|Accident]].<ref name="Garrett HLR"/>  The federal highway is marked as Main Street and intersects Accident Friendsville Road and Accident Bittinger Road, which heads east toward the [[James Drane House]].<ref name="Garrett HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps US 219 in MD"/>

After leaving Accident, US&nbsp;219 encounters an access road to Bear Creek Road and Fish Hatchery Road near the [[Kaese Mill]] before the federal highway crosses the latter road and Bear Creek and begins the ascent to Keyser's Ridge, with the northbound direction gaining a climbing lane.  After passing Northern Garrett High School and a scenic overlook, the federal highway curves to the east and then back north as it approaches the summit.  The climbing lane ends northbound and another climbing lane begins in the southbound direction.<ref name="Google Maps US 219 in MD"/>  Shortly after the descent from the summit, US&nbsp;219 meets I-68 (National Freeway) and US&nbsp;40 at Exit&nbsp;14 of I-68 in Keyser's Ridge.<ref name="Garrett HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps US 219 in MD"/>  US&nbsp;219 exits onto the eastbound direction of the freeway at the [[cloverleaf interchange]], while US&nbsp;40 heads north from the interchange to meet the west end of [[U.S. Route 40 Alternate (Keyser's Ridge&ndash;Cumberland, Maryland)|US&nbsp;40&nbsp;Alternate]] then turn northwest into Pennsylvania.<ref name="Google Maps US 219 in MD"/>  After meeting [[Maryland Route 495|MD&nbsp;495]] at Exit&nbsp;19 in Grantsville, US&nbsp;219 exits north onto Chestnut Ridge Road at Exit&nbsp;22.<ref name="Garrett HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps US 219 in MD"/>  The federal highway intersects US&nbsp;40&nbsp;Alternate (National Pike) in the hamlet of High Point before crossing the Pennsylvania state line, where US&nbsp;219 continues north toward [[Meyersdale, Pennsylvania|Meyersdale]].<ref name="Google Maps US 219 in MD"/>

==History==
In 1909, the Maryland State Roads Commission targeted the pre-existing road from Oakland to the National Turnpike at Keyser's Ridge for upgrade to an all-weather road as part of the original state road system.<ref name="1911 src report"/>  The existing road followed roughly the same alignment as the present US&nbsp;219, with three major deviations: around Deep Creek, where the road crossed Deep Creek to the east of the present Deep Creek Bridge; Hoyes, where the road followed Friendsville Road north to Hoyes, then Hoyes Road east to the present alignment; and north of Accident, where the road turned northeast and used a very curvy alignment to cross Bear Creek and climb the lower slopes of Keyser's Ridge to meet the present road near Northern Garrett High School.<ref name="USGS 1900 Oakland"/><ref name="USGS 1900 Accident"/>  The new highway, known as the State Road, was completed from Oakland to Thayerville in 1910.<ref name="1911 src report"/><ref name="Garrett County History"/>  The segment from Thayerville to McHenry, which followed the pre-existing alignment, was completed in 1913.  The part of the State Road from McHenry to Accident, which bypassed Hoyes, was completed in 1914.  Finally, the section from Accident to Keyser's Ridge, which bypassed the crooked road around Bear Creek, was completed in 1915.<ref name="1915 src report"/>

Once the State Road from Oakland to Keyser's Ridge was completed, attention turned to the south of Oakland.  The existing road, part of the Seneca Trail, approached Oakland from the south at Third Street.<ref name="USGS 1900 Oakland"/>  The new road, constructed from Oakland to Gortner in 1915 and 1916, met the road to Mountain Lake Park next to Southern Garrett High School, then followed Oak Street west into the county seat.<ref name="1915 src report"/><ref name="1919 src report"/>  The road from Gortner to Red House was constructed between 1924 and 1927 and from Red House to the West Virginia state line between 1927 and 1930.<ref name="1927 map"/><ref name="NBI Youghiogheny River"/><ref name="1930 map"/><ref name="1926 src report"/>  Further north, the Chestnut Ridge Road was constructed beginning in 1915.<ref name="1915 src report"/>  The Deep Creek Dam was constructed starting in 1923 and Deep Creek Lake began to fill in January 1925.  The State Road was relocated around Deep Creek Lake and the first Deep Creek Bridge was built in 1924.<ref name="Garrett County Book"/>  In 1927, the year both U.S. Highways and Maryland state highways were assigned numbers, Chestnut Ridge Road was marked as US&nbsp;219 and the State Road was marked as MD&nbsp;37.<ref name="1927 map"/>  In 1935, US&nbsp;219 was extended west along US 40 and then south toward West Virginia, replacing the MD&nbsp;37 designation for its entire length.<ref name="1935 map"/>

After World War II, US&nbsp;219 was reconstructed into its modern form for most of its length.  The segment between Oakland and Thayerville was reconstructed between 1948 and 1950.<ref name="1948 src report"/><ref name="1950 src report"/>  The stretch from Keyser's Ridge to Accident was relocated around 1950.<ref name="1950 src report"/>  The section of US&nbsp;219 between Gortner and Red House was widened between 1950 and 1952.<ref name="1950 src report"/><ref name="1952 src report"/>  The stretch between Thayerville and the Deep Creek Bridge was rebuilt from 1952 to 1955.<ref name="1952 src report"/><ref name="1956 src report"/>  The McHenry to Accident part of US&nbsp;219 was reconstructed starting in 1952.<ref name="1952 src report"/>  Chestnut Ridge Road was relocated around 1956.<ref name="1956 src report"/>  Finally, US&nbsp;219 between Gortner and Oakland was rebuilt between 1957 and 1959, including a relocation at the northern end that included its present intersection with MD&nbsp;135 and a bridge over the B&O Railroad.<ref name="1958 src report"/><ref name="NBI CSX"/>  In the late 1960s, US&nbsp;219 was relocated from the Deep Creek Bridge through McHenry, leaving behind Deep Creek Drive as an old alignment.<ref name="Garrett County Book"/>  After the construction of I-68 in the mid 1970s, US&nbsp;219 was moved to the new freeway between Keyser's Ridge and Chestnut Ridge Road.<ref name="NBI 219 over 68"/><ref name="1980 map"/>  Finally, the present Deep Creek Bridge was completed in 1987, replacing the 1924 structure.<ref name="Garrett County Book"/><ref name="NBI Deep Creek Lake"/>

==Future==
There are two projects planned for US&nbsp;219 in Maryland.  The Oakland Bypass will run from the present intersection of US&nbsp;219 and MD&nbsp;135 on the east edge of the town to US&nbsp;219 north of the Walmart Supercenter.<ref name="Oakland Bypass"/>  There are also plans by Maryland and Pennsylvania to upgrade US&nbsp;219 to a freeway between I-68 east of Grantsville and the existing freeway bypass of Meyersdale.<ref name="Chestnut Ridge Road"/><ref name="US 219 South"/>

==Junction list==
The entire route is in [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett County]].
