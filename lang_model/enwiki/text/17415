"'''Over There'''" is the two-part [[Fringe (season 2)|second season]] [[Season finale|finale]] of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] science fiction drama series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]''. They are the 22nd and 23rd episodes of the season, and the 42nd and 43rd episodes of the series overall. Both parts were written by [[Academy Award]]-winning screenwriter [[Akiva Goldsman]], together with [[showrunner]]s [[Jeff Pinkner]] and [[J. H. Wyman]]. Goldsman also served as director, his first such credit since the [[A New Day in the Old Town|season premiere]].

''Fringe''{{'}}s premise is based on the idea of two [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]], our own and the Other Side, each of which contain various historical [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncrasies]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Strachan|first=Alex|title=''Fringe'': Two Worlds, One Great TV Show |work=[[The Vancouver Sun]] |publisher=Pacific Newspaper Group |location=Canada |date=2010-10-07 |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/worlds+great+show/3636133/story.html |archiveurl=http://www.mail-archive.com/medianews@etskywarn.net/msg09144.html |archivedate=2010-10-08 }}</ref> The two universes began to clash in 1985, after [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Dr. Walter Bishop]] ([[John Noble]]) stole the parallel universe version of his son, [[Peter Bishop|Peter]], following his own son's death.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Peter|episodelink=Peter (Fringe) |series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[David Straiton]] (director), [[Akiva Goldsman]] (story), [[J.

[[FBI]] agent [[Olivia Dunham]] ([[Anna Torv]]) and Walter lead a team of former [[Fringe (TV series)#Premise|Cortexiphan]] test subjects to retrieve him, after discovering that Peter is an unwitting part of Walternate's plans to bring about the destruction of our universe using an ancient [[doomsday device]].

In the finale, the main characters spend the longest amount of time in the parallel universe to date. The writers sought to emphasize the differences between the two worlds: Anna Torv created a unique personality and physical demeanor for her character's [[doppelg<U+00E4>nger]], Fauxlivia; [[DC Comics]] designed special covers based upon some of their classic editions to display in the Other Side. These and other [[popular culture]] differences were noted and appreciated by critics, persuading the writers to add more in the [[Fringe (season 3)|third season]]. The episodes mark the first appearance of recurring character [[Lincoln Lee]] ([[Seth Gabel]]), as well as the return of actor [[Kirk Acevedo]] as Agent [[Charlie Francis (Fringe)|Charlie Francis]]. At the time, guest star [[Leonard Nimoy]]'s appearance as [[William Bell (Fringe)|William Bell]] marked his final commitment to the show.

Alhough originally intended to air on the same night, the two parts were broadcast in the United States a week apart. On its initial airing on May 13, 2010, an estimated 5.99&nbsp;million viewers watched part one. Part two aired on May 20, and was viewed by an estimated audience of 5.68&nbsp;million. Both episodes received overwhelmingly positive reviews, and the season was chosen for a significant number of "best of" lists by various media outlets; many critics praised the second episode's [[cliffhanger]] in particular. The finale was included in most of the categories at ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s voter-driven TV Season Finale Awards, placing first in two. Pinkner, Wyman, and Goldsman submitted both episodes for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series|drama writing]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series|directing]] categories for the [[62nd Primetime Emmy Awards]], and Nimoy submitted his work from the second episode for consideration in the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series]] category; none received a nomination.

==Plot==
===Part one===
[[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Dr. Walter Bishop]] ([[John Noble]]) and [[FBI]] agent [[Olivia Dunham]] ([[Anna Torv]]) discover that [[Peter Bishop]] ([[Joshua Jackson]]) has agreed to return with his real father, dubbed [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)#Walternate|"Walternate"]] (Noble), to [[parallel universe (fiction)|his own universe]] called the Other Side, which runs parallel to ours. One of the mysterious [[List_of_Fringe_characters#The_Observer|Observer]]s ([[Michael Cerveris]]) leaves Olivia a note indicating that Peter is named in a prophecy as the one responsible for the end of the world. To warn Peter of his impending role, the [[Fringe (TV series)#Premise|Fringe Division]] work with biotechnology corporation [[Fringe (TV series)#Premise|Massive Dynamic]] to come up with a way to cross over. They form a plan that takes advantage of Olivia's universe-hopping ability, and recruit three other [[Fringe (TV series)#Premise|Cortexiphan]] test subjects who have unique abilities: [[List of Fringe characters#Nick Lane|Nick Lane]] ([[David Call]]), [[Sally Clark (Fringe)|Sally Clark]] ([[Pascale Hutton]]), and [[List of Fringe characters#James Heath|James Heath]] ([[Omar Metwally]]), two of whom appeared in previous episodes.{{#tag:ref|See:

James dies shortly after arrival, but the rest manage to escape the alternate reality's Fringe Division, who had used their special technology to detect their arrival. It is revealed that Walternate is the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] on the Other Side.

Peter reunites with his real mother, [[Elizabeth Bishop (Fringe)|Elizabeth]] ([[Orla Brady]]), while Walter's team journeys to meet with [[List of Fringe characters#William Bell|William Bell]] ([[Leonard Nimoy]]) at [[Central Park]]. But instead of Bell the alternate Fringe Division appears, and attacks Walter's team. Nick is shot and Sally stays with him; she produces a suicidal fireball that burns both them and the Fringe Division's principal investigator [[List of Fringe characters#Lincoln Lee|Lincoln Lee]] ([[Seth Gabel]]) to ashes. Walter is shot and is taken to the hospital. Olivia follows her alternate counterpart and encounters Bell, who insists he did not betray their location to the Fringe Division and tells her that Walter is in trouble. Walternate is seen in the room housing the doomsday device Peter will be a part of, and leaves with its final component.

===Part two===
Walternate learns of Walter's presence in the hospital and dispatches "Fauxlivia" (Torv) and "Alt-Charlie" ([[Kirk Acevedo]]) to apprehend him, but before their arrival Bell and Olivia liberate Walter and escape. Fauxlivia sees a surveillance shot of Olivia and Walter and decides to confer with Walternate about the doppelg<U+00E4>ngers. During a discussion in his office, Walternate lies to Peter about the doomsday machine's real purpose, claiming it can help to heal both worlds. Fauxlivia meets Peter in Walternate's office and subsequently drives him to his new apartment. Walter and Bell travel to Harvard to collect some equipment necessary for the journey back to their own universe, and Walter reveals his intense dislike for Bell, whom he considers to have been a selfish war profiteer while he himself was locked away for seventeen years. Bell tells Walter that the parallel universe equivalent of himself died in a car accident as a young man. Olivia confronts Fauxlivia, who recognizes that Olivia has feelings for Peter. The women fight, and after rendering Fauxlivia unconscious Olivia assumes her identity. Meanwhile, Peter discovers that the machine is symbiotic and needs a particular human to control it<U+2014>him.

Olivia and an oblivious Charlie visit Peter to take him to a safe location. Olivia knocks out Charlie and reveals herself to Peter, informing him of the machine's real purpose and Walternate's intentions. Peter tells her that he does not belong in either reality, following which Olivia admits her romantic feelings for him and convinces him to leave with her. The couple race to meet Walter and Bell at the Opera House, where Fauxlivia and a team of Fringe Commandos catch up with them. Bell and Olivia hold off the assault while Peter and Walter set up the dimensional device to enable their return home. Lacking a fuel source for the device, Bell sacrifices himself to create a nuclear reaction, using his body's unstable molecular state. Close to death, Bell reveals that he removed Walter's memories at his own request, and he and Walter are reconciled. Olivia, Walter, and Peter return home. Peter tells Walter he will never understand him, but because Walter traveled to another universe twice to save him<U+2014>which has "gotta count for something"<U+2014>he forgives him. Olivia is revealed to be Fauxlivia, infiltrating Our Side, when she arrives at a typewriter communication station to await orders. The Olivia from our world is then seen in a military detention center on the Other Side. Walternate visits and stares at Olivia without speaking before leaving her in the dark, in solitary confinement.

===Writing and filming===
"Over There" was written by [[Academy Award]]-winning screenwriter and frequent ''Fringe'' collaborator [[Akiva Goldsman]], together with [[showrunner]]s [[Jeff Pinkner]] and [[J. H. Wyman]]. Goldsman directed the episodes, his first such credit since the [[A New Day in the Old Town|season premiere]].<ref name=comicbookresources/><ref name=avclub2/> He explained the finale in a January 2010 interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'': "We're trying to do the last two episodes as a singular event, a little bit more movie-like. It's really one big story. We're approaching it like a mini-feature.

Pinkner and Wyman brought back the "Cortexiphan kids", introduced in the first two seasons, because they felt that part of the storyline was really interesting.

The finale introduces parallel-universe versions of familiar characters, including the Fauxlivia version of Olivia Dunham, both played by actress [[Anna Torv]]. One topic of conversation among fans, journalists, and those working on the show was what to call the alternate Olivia to differentiate the two. Names varied, with many using "Fauxlivia", "Bolivia", and/or "Altlivia".<ref>Pinkner et al, 2:35<U+2013>2:40</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b209072_will_olivia_fight_fauxlivia_fringe.html| title = Will Olivia Fight Fauxlivia?

"Over There" marks the first time Olivia meets Fauxlivia. Their meeting was one of the first scenes to be shot; this caused Anna Torv to be anxious about her new character's traits "coming across", as she had not yet developed all her mannerisms for Fauxlivia. While filming the conversation between the two, they did not use a double; Torv memorized the timing and where she should be looking and pointing her gun, and the characters were filmed one at a time.<ref>Pinkner et al, 20:18<U+2013>22:13</ref> Torv commented about the scene, "You're talking to air.

The first part of the finale received generally positive reviews.

Like part one, the second part premiered to positive reviews. IGN's Ramsey Isler wrote that it "changed the whole landscape of the show's main plot arc. Although there were some rough spots in the execution of this story, overall it's one hell of a way to end the season."

He was "kind of torn" on the Peter-Olivia kiss, wished Peter and the doomsday device had been set up more for the third season, and believed the Olivia-Fauxlivia interaction to be "a little strange," as the two went from discussing their respective families to "ass kicking". Isler did praise the fight itself.<ref name=ign2/> Ken Tucker praised the acting and the writers, noting "The fact that the series can accommodate a fan like me only confirms what a well-wrought piece of pop culture ''Fringe'' has become."<ref name=ewreview2>{{cite news|url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2010/05/21/fringe-season-2-episode-23/ |title=''Fringe'' season finale recap: 'Over There, Part 2,' a kiss, a 'death,' and the 'monsters in our skin' |first=Ken|last=Tucker |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=Time Inc.

Andrew Hanson of the ''Los Angeles Times'' felt the second part fulfilled all of the criteria for an incredible season finale: the season's arc had a "pay-off" he "didn't see coming" in the aftermath of Walternate crossing universes to take back Peter; the entire episode was an "event" because it spent more time in the parallel universe than ever before, and it had an "A+ cliffhanger".<ref name=latimes2>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/05/fringe-end-of-a-chapter.html |title=''Fringe'': End of a chapter |first=Andrew |last=Hanson |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=2010-05-21 |accessdate=2011-04-05}}</ref> MTV's ''Fringe'' reviewer Josh Wigler enjoyed the ending, calling it "one heck of a cliffhanger!"<ref name=mtvreview2>{{cite web |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/05/20/fringe-episode-223-over-there-part-2-of-2/ |title=''Fringe'': Episode 2.23, 'Over There, Part 2 of 2' |first=Josh |last=Wigler |work=''[[MTV]]'' |publisher=[[MTV Networks]] ([[Viacom]]) |date=2010-05-20 |accessdate=2011-04-05}}</ref> [[James Poniewozik]] from ''[[Time Magazine]]'' positively compared both parts of the finale to ''[[The X-Files]]'', writing that, unlike that series, ''Fringe''{{'}}s standalone episodes contribute to the overall mythology of the show.
