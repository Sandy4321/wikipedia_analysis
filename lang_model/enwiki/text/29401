"'''Comme j'ai mal'''" (English: "How Much I Suffer") is a [[1995 in music|1995]] song recorded by [[France|French]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Myl<U+00E8>ne Farmer]]. Fourth [[Single (music)|single]] from her fourth album ''[[Anamorphos<U+00E9>e]]'', it was released on 1 July 1996. It was a relative failure: indeed, it failed to reach the top ten in France and was the least-selling single from the album.

==Background==
In June 1996, Farmer continued her concert tour through [[France]] that she had begun on 25 May, while her fourth studio album ''[[Anamorphos<U+00E9>e]]'' was a great success despite the lack of promotion. However, on 15 June, the singer fall at her concert in [[Lyon]] and broke her wrist, forcing her to stop her tour. To make her fans wait, the release of the song "Comme j'ai mal", which was initially scheduled for August, was delayed to July, although no music video was shot yet at the time.<ref>{{cite web |title="Comme j'ai mal" |url=http://www.sans-logique.com/mylene-farmer/discographie/singles/single.php?single=comme-jai-mal |publisher=Sans-logique |language=French |accessdate=1 January 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Myl<U+00E8>ne Farmer - "Comme j'ai mal" - Histoire du single |url=http://www.mylene.net/mylene/d_s_comme-j-ai-mal_histoire.php |publisher=Mylene.net |language=French |accessdate=1 March 2010}}</ref>

The three official remixes made for the various formats were produced by [[Laurent Boutonnat]] and Bertrand Ch<U+00E2>tenet. The song was included in the studio version on the best of album ''[[Les Mots (Myl<U+00E8>ne Farmer album)|Les Mots]]'' in 2001. The song was only performed during the 1996 concerts tour and is available on the ''[[Live <U+00E0> Bercy]]''.

==Lyrics and music==
"Comme j'ai mal" seems to be as "a confession and may be related to the texts of "[[Ainsi soit je... (song)|Ainsi soit je...]]" and "Laisse le vent emporter tout"". Farmer evokes "her pain of living that prevents her from enjoying life"; she also talks about her lucidity and disillusionment and "that leads her to disconnect both physically and psychologically from the real world for a better world that belongs to her".<ref name="Le Dictionnaire, p. 75-78">{{cite book |title=Le Dictionnaire des Chansons de Myl<U+00E8>ne Farmer |first=Beno<U+00EE>t |last=Cachin |year=2006 |publisher=Tournon |pages=75-78 |language=French |isbn=2-35144-000-5}}</ref> With this song, Farmer keeps up with lyrics "evoking death and the escape from reality".<ref>{{cite book |title=L'Int<U+00E9>grale Myl<U+00E8>ne Farmer |first=Erwan |last=Chuberre |year=2007 |publisher=City |page=87 |language=French |isbn=978-2-35288-108-7}}</ref>

==Music video==
The video was produced by [[Marcus Nispel]], who had already directed those of "[[XXL (Myl<U+00E8>ne Farmer song)|XXL]]" and "[[L'Instant X]]", and later that of "[[Souviens-toi du jour]]". He also composed the screenplay with Farmer, and this video is generally regarded as his best. This Requiem Publishing production was filmed in [[Los Angeles]] for two days in August 1996 with a budget of about 80,000 euros. The video was produced twice, because the scenery of the first one was ransacked by [[Black panther|panther]]s that were originally  included in the video.<ref>{{cite book |title=Myl<U+00E8>ne Farmer, ph<U+00E9>nom<U+00E9>nale |last=Chuberre |first=Erwan |year=2008 |publisher=City |language=French |isbn=978-2-35288-176-6 |pages=194-95}}</ref> Only few photographs were taken by the only photographer present at the shooting, Jeff Dahlgren, who has played in the 1992 film ''[[Giorgino]]''. The costumes, make up and hairstyles of Farmer has required several hours of preparation.<ref>{{cite web |title="Comme j'ai mal", music video |url=http://www.mylenefarmeriscalled.net/cjmclip.html |publisher=Mylenefarmeriscalled |language=French |accessdate=1 January 2008}}</ref>

[[Image:Comme j'ai mal (video).jpg|left|220px|thumb|[[Myl<U+00E8>ne Farmer]] converted into a [[butterfly]] in the music video "Comme j'ai mal".]]

The video features Farmer at different stages of her life, and two actors who seem to be her parents. At the beginning, Farmer plays with a [[praying mantis]] in a cupboard. Then a little girl in a dark room opens a box containing many insects that she likes. When her father comes, she hides them in the box. She is then beaten by the latter who also starts to break everything in the room. With her doll and her box, the girl runs to take refuge in her cupboard where she plays with an insect. Then she eats sugar and gets covered with [[honey]] and finds herself in a [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]] in a forest. She begins to leave it, the sticky body with [[wing]]s in the back, very long nails, ruffled hair. She has therefore converted into a [[butterfly]] whose face is that of Farmer. The father cries because he understands that his daughter is gone away.<ref>{{cite book |title=Myl<U+00E8>ne Farmer - La part d'ombre |first=Caroline |last=Bee |coauthors=Antoine Bioy, Benjamin Thiry |year=2005 |publisher=Archipel |page=290 |language=French |isbn=2-84187-790-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title="Comme j'ai mal", music video |url=http://www.sans-logique.com/mylene-farmer/clips/clip.php?clip=comme-jai-mal |publisher=Sans-logique |language=French |accessdate=1 January 2008}}</ref>

The video was broadcast for the first time on television about one month after the single's release. According to French magazine ''Instant-Mag'', this video underlines "the relationship with a father figure". "The girl, scared by her father, who hides in her cupboard, is the representation of a child beaten and mistreated. The most painful is the metaphor of Farmer converted into a [[butterfly]], which has therefore no more than one day to live : allegory of a child injured in search of [[paradise]] ?"<ref>''Instant-Mag'', No. 7, 2001, p. 7</ref>

The music video is included on the videos albums ''[[Music Videos II]]'' and ''[[Music Videos II & III]]''.

==Promotion and chart performances==
Farmer performed the song only in the show ''Tip Top'', broadcast on [[TF1]] on 24 October 1996. At the same time, she also sang "[[La Poup<U+00E9>e qui fait non]]" in [[duet]] with [[Khaled (musician)|Khaled]], which is a song originally composed by [[Michel Polnareff]].<ref>{{cite web |title="Comme j'ai mal", television performances |url=http://www.sans-logique.com/mylene-farmer/discographie/repertoire-des-chansons.php?chanson=comme-jai-mal |publisher=Sans-logique |language=French |accessdate=1 January 2008}}</ref>

"Comme j'ai mal"'s trajectories on the singles charts were rather disappointing in comparison with the previous three singles. In [[France]], the single narrowly failed to enter in the top ten and peaked at number 11 on 10 August 1996, then dropped. It fell off the top 50 after nine weeks.<ref name="Lescharts">{{cite web |title="Comme j'ai mal", French Singles Chart |url=http://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Myl%E8ne+Farmer&titel=Comme+j%27ai+mal&cat=s |publisher=Lescharts |language=French |accessdate=1 January 2008}}</ref> Thus, the song remains the lower-selling single off ''[[Anamorphos<U+00E9>e]]''. On [[Ultratop|Belgian Utratop 40]], "Comme j'ai mal" started at number 36 on 24 August, reached a peak at number 21 the next week, fell quickly and totaled four weeks, which was the shortest running for a single from ''[[Anamorphos<U+00E9>e]]'' in Belgium.<ref name="Ultratop">{{cite web |title="Comme j'ai mal", Belgian (Wallonia) Singles Chart |url=http://www.ultratop.be/fr/showitem.asp?key=62685&cat=s |publisher=Ultratop |language=French |accessdate=3 January 2007}}</ref>
