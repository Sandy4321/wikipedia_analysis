'''''Dig Me Out''''' is the third studio album by the American [[rock music|rock]] band [[Sleater-Kinney]], released on April 8, 1997 by [[Kill Rock Stars]]. The album was produced by [[John Goodmanson]] and recorded from December 1996 to January 1997 at John and Stu's Place in [[Seattle, Washington]]. ''Dig Me Out'' marked the debut of [[Janet Weiss]], who became the band's longest serving and last drummer. The music on the record was influenced by traditional [[rock and roll]] bands, while the lyrics deal with issues of heartbreak and survival.

Two singles were released in support of the album: "One More Hour" and "Little Babies". The title track "Dig Me Out" peaked at number 6 on the [[KEXP-FM|KEXP]] Top 90.3 Album Chart in 1997 without being released as a single. The album received substantial acclaim from [[music journalism|music critics]], who praised the album's energy and [[feminism|feminist]] lyrics. ''Dig Me Out'' is included on several publications' best album lists. In 2003, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it number 272 on its list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].

== Background and recording ==
''Dig Me Out'' is the follow-up to [[Sleater-Kinney]]'s highly acclaimed second album ''[[Call the Doctor]]'', released in 1996 by the [[queercore]] independent record label [[Chainsaw Records]]. ''Call the Doctor'' confirmed the band's reputation as one of the major musical acts from the Pacific Northwest, rebelling against [[gender roles]], [[consumerism]], and [[indie rock]]'s male-dominated hierarchy.<ref name="Allmusic biography"/> After the release of ''Call the Doctor'', drummer [[Janet Weiss]] of [[Quasi]] joined the band. Previously, the band had had a number of temporary drummers, including Misty Farrell, [[Lora Macfarlane]], and Toni Gogin. Weiss would eventually become Sleater-Kinney's longest serving and last drummer.<ref name="Addicted interview 3"/> For its third album, Sleater-Kinney worked again with producer [[John Goodmanson]].<ref name="Addicted interview 2"/> The band left Chainsaw Records and decided to release the album through [[Kill Rock Stars]], another independent record label which singer and guitarist [[Corin Tucker]] thought had better resources to ensure the band's distribution. Goodmanson also remarked that Kill Rock Stars afforded the band a generous amount of studio time for an independent label, stating that ''Call the Doctor'' only took four days to record while ''Dig Me Out'' was recorded over the period of eight days.<ref name="Addicted interview 5"/>

''Dig Me Out'' was written in nearly two months and recorded from December 1996 to January 1997 at John and Stu's Place in [[Seattle, Washington]].<ref name="RS Hot-Rockin' Beats"/><ref name="DMO Booklet"/> During the recording sessions, recording the vocal interplay between Tucker and co-vocalist and guitarist [[Carrie Brownstein]] involved some difficulties. However, the producer took care and prevented favoring one voice over the other. As Goodmanson recalls: "We always used different mikes for the lead vocal and for the second vocal, or different kinds of processing to make those things really distinct. To make it so you can hear both things at once".<ref name="Addicted interview 3"/> Goodmanson also noted that the fact that the band features no bass player was an advantage for the album's production.<ref name="Addicted interview 2"/> He explained: "The awesome thing about having no bass player is you can make the guitars sound as big as you want. Usually you have to clear all that room out for the bass, so you can hear the bass line. With no bass there, you can just go for giant guitar sounds that you wouldn't normally be able to go for".<ref name="Addicted interview 2"/>

== Music and lyrics ==
Musically, ''Dig Me Out'' was considered "rockier" than its predecessor. Weiss' drumming style was influenced by traditional [[rock and roll]] bands such as [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Beatles]], and [[The Kinks]], as well as numerous [[blues rock]] musicians such as [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Billy Boy Arnold]], and [[Bessie Smith]], among others.<ref name="Addicted interview 2"/> Both Tucker and Brownstein remarked that Weiss became an essential part of the band's sound. According to Brownstein, Weiss was "the first drummer that matches [their] energy." Similarly, Tucker commented: "Musically, she's completed our band. She's become the bottom end and the solidness that we've really wanted for our songwriting".<ref name="Addicted interview 2"/> Weiss also provides [[Clapping|hand claps]] and [[tambourine]] in "Turn It On".<ref name="Addicted interview 2"/> The song "Words and Guitar" was said to "[leap] and [skit] with the just-released repression of early [[Talking Heads]]",<ref name="Spin review"/> while "Dance Song '97" was said to "sport [[Devo]]-esque keyboards of a distinctly '80s vintage".<ref name="RS review"/> ''Dig Me Out'' also contains more guitar and vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein than ''Call the Doctor''.<ref name="Addicted interview 4"/> Brownstein pointed out that "If you were to separate our guitar parts I don't necessarily think they would fully stand on their own. Our songs [...] aren't really complete until the other person has put their part over it, and their vocals".<ref name="Addicted interview 4"/>

The lyrical themes on ''Dig Me Out'' deal with issues of heartbreak and survival.<ref name="Addicted interview 1"/> The song "One More Hour" is about the breakup of Tucker and Brownstein's romantic relationship.<ref name="Romantic relationship"/> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine published a controversial article discussing Tucker and Brownstein's personal relationship without their permission.<ref name="RS Hot-Rockin' Beats"/> Brownstein felt that "it was a complete invasion of privacy. My parents didn't know Corin and I were going out. They didn't know I had ever dated a woman before. It was horrible. I was pissed at ''Spin'', really mad. Luckily my parents are great people, but God forbid I would have some family that would disown me over something like that. And I would have totally held ''Spin'' responsible for that."<ref name="RS Hot-Rockin' Beats"/> The song features a lot of vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein. Chris Nelson of ''[[Addicted to Noise]]'' said of the song, "one can almost hear Tucker crying in the studio as she wails, 'I needed it', while behind her Brownstein offers her attempts at consolation".<ref name="Addicted interview 3"/> The album also contains songs that show frustration with society and male dominance.<ref name="Sputnikmusic review"/> The title song "Dig Me Out" exposes a woman in a dominant role, while "Little Babies" is a protest against the traditional maternity role.<ref name="Sputnikmusic review"/> "Buy Her a Candy" deals with a man's attraction towards a woman and features mellow guitar work.<ref name="Sputnikmusic review"/> The last track, "Jenny", is about a girl who commits suicide because of her worthless life as a servant to men.<ref name="Sputnikmusic review"/>

== Release ==
''Dig Me Out'' was released on April 8, 1997 by Kill Rock Stars.<ref name="S-K KRS"/> The album cover is an homage to The Kinks' 1965 album ''[[The Kink Kontroversy]]''.<ref name="Treble"/> After the release, the band went on a tour to promote the album; a performance of "Words and Guitar" at [[El Rey Theatre]], [[Los Angeles]] is featured in the documentary film ''Songs for Cassavetes'' by Justin Mitchell.<ref name="tour"/> As of March 1999, the album has sold around 56,000 copies in the U.S. according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]].<ref name="Album sales"/> Two songs from the album, "One More Hour" and "Little Babies", were released as singles by [[Matador Records]] on June 1, 1998 and September 7, 1998 respectively.<ref name="Allmusic single 1"/><ref name="Allmusic single 2"/> The first single features the song "I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone" from ''Call the Doctor'' as the B-side, while the second single features "I'm Not Waiting", also from their previous album.<ref name="Allmusic single 1"/><ref name="Allmusic single 2"/> The compact disc version of "One More Hour" includes a third song, "Don't Think You Wanna", which was originally released on the band's debut album ''[[Sleater-Kinney (album)|Sleater-Kinney]]''.<ref name="Allmusic single 1"/> The song "Dig Me Out" peaked at number 6 on the [[KEXP-FM|KEXP]] Top 90.3 Album Chart in 1997 without being released as a single.<ref name="KEXP Album Chart"/>
