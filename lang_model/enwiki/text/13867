The '''Trump International Hotel and Tower''', also known as '''Trump Tower Chicago''' and locally as the '''Trump Tower''', is a skyscraper [[condo-hotel]] in downtown [[Chicago]], Illinois. The building, named after real estate developer [[Donald Trump]], was designed by architect [[Adrian Smith (architect)|Adrian Smith]] of [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]]. [[Bovis Lend Lease]] built the 96-story structure, which reached a height of {{convert|1362|ft|m}} including its spire,  its roof [[topping out]] at {{convert|1170|ft|m}}. It is adjacent to the main branch of the [[Chicago River]], with a view of the entry to [[Lake Michigan]] beyond a series of bridges over the river. The building received publicity when the winner of the [[The Apprentice (U.S. Season 1)|first season of ''The Apprentice'']] television show, [[Bill Rancic]], chose to manage the construction of the tower.

Trump announced in 2001 that the skyscraper would become the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|tallest building in the world]], but after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the building plans were scaled back, and its design has undergone several revisions. When topped out in 2009 it became the [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|second-tallest]] building in the United States after Chicago's [[Willis Tower]]. It is expected to be surpassed by the [[1 World Trade Center]] in New York City in the middle of 2013, and by the on-hold [[Chicago Spire]] if completed. Trump Tower surpassed Chicago's [[John Hancock Center]] as the building with the world's highest residence above ground-level and held this title until the completion of the [[Burj Khalifa]].

The design of the building includes, from the ground up, retail space, a parking garage, a hotel, and [[condominium]]s. The 339-room hotel opened for business with limited accommodations and services on January 30, 2008. April 28 of that year marked the grand opening with full accommodation and services.  A restaurant on the 16th floor, named [[Sixteen (Chicago restaurant)|Sixteen]], opened in early 2008 to favorable reviews. The building topped out in late 2008 and construction was completed in 2009.

[[File:DowntownChicagoILatNight.jpg|left|240px|thumb|The site of the tower was occupied by the former Chicago Sun-Times building (left), the [[Wrigley Building]], [[River Plaza]] and [[Tribune Tower]].|alt=skyline of city at night]]
The tower is situated at 401 North Wabash Avenue in the [[River North Gallery District, Near North Side, Chicago|River North Gallery District]], part of the [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of Chicago. The building occupies the site vacated by the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', one of the city's two major newspapers, and its location within the River North Gallery District places it in the neighborhood that has had a high concentration of art galleries since the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB373CF70C2BD27&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Gallery District Boundaries Reach Beyond River North|accessdate=2009-10-05|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Rotzoll, Brenda Warner|date=1992-09-11}}</ref> The site, at the foot of [[Rush Street (Chicago)|Rush Street]], is located on the north side of the [[Chicago River]] just west of the [[Wrigley Building]] and the [[Michigan Avenue Bridge]], and just east of [[Marina City]] and [[330 North Wabash]]  The building is close to numerous [[Chicago landmarks]]; it borders the [[Michigan-Wacker District]], which is a Registered Historic District.<ref name="nrhpdoc">{{cite web|url=http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis/PDFs/200181.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Michigan-Wacker Historic District|date=1978-02-03 |format=PDF |author=Robert Wagner |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2009-05-03}}</ref> Parts of the building are visible throughout the city, and the entire length of the building is visible from Chicago River waterway traffic, as well as from locations to the east along the river, such as the mouth of [[Lake Michigan]], the [[Lake Shore Drive]] Overpass, and the [[Columbus Drive]] Bridge.<ref name=OtAsip/>

The building is across the Chicago River from the [[Chicago Loop]], the city's [[business district]]. It is a block away from the southern end of the [[Magnificent Mile]] portion of [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]]. The restaurant on the 16th floor, which is named [[Sixteen (Chicago restaurant)|Sixteen]], has a clear view of the Chicago River's entrance to Lake Michigan and of the four buildings completed in the 1920s that flank the Michigan Avenue Bridge (Wrigley Building, [[Tribune Tower]], [[333 North Michigan]], and [[360 North Michigan]]).

== Design and architecture ==
The design of the building incorporates three [[Setback (architecture)|setback features]] designed to provide visual continuity with the surrounding skyline,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.som.com//resources/projects/4/9/4/printPreview.html |title= Trump International Hotel & Tower |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070306203550/http://www.som.com/resources/projects/4/9/4/printPreview.html|accessdate=2008-06-09 |archivedate=2007-03-06|publisher=[[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]]}}</ref> each reflecting the height of a nearby building. The first setback, on the east side of the building, aligns with the [[cornice]] line of the Wrigley Building to the east; the second, on the west side, aligns with [[River Plaza]] to the north and with the Marina City Towers to the west. The third setback, on the east side, relates to 330 North Wabash building (formerly known as IBM Plaza).<ref name=B324>Beaver, p. 324.</ref> However, some views distort the alignment of the second setback.{{cref|a}} The setbacks and rounded edges of the building combat [[vortex]] formation which may occur in the "Windy City".<ref name=Ribrfts/>  The body of the building is raised {{convert|30|ft|m}} above the main Wabash entrance and {{convert|70|ft|m}} above the Chicago River.<ref name=1otwtb>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Z7UA73jthg4C&pg=PA216&dq=Trump+Tower+Chicago&ei=rsgZS7KAE5DUNKmTjesK#v=onepage&q=Trump%20Tower%20Chicago&f=false|title=101 of the world's tallest buildings|page=216|publisher=Images Publishing|year=2006|isbn=1864701730|author=Binder, Georges}}</ref>  The building uses clear [[emissivity|low-emissivity]] coated glass and a curved wing-shaped polished stainless steel [[mullion]] system that projects {{convert|9|in|cm}} from the glass line.

=== Legal issues ===
In October 2006, controversy erupted over a {{convert|10|by|4.5|ft|adj=on}} street kiosk at the foot of the Magnificent Mile in front of the Wrigley Building at 410 North Michigan Avenue that advertised Trump Tower a full block away.<ref name=TisfTpks>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-0610190370oct20,0,3273069.story|title=Trim in store for Trump's promotional kiosk sign|accessdate=2008-05-10|date=2006-10-20|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Kamin, Blair}}</ref>  Extensive debate and publicity occurred on the issue of whether such advertising should have been allowed. Two distinct pieces of legislation in 2002 and 2003 by the [[Chicago City Council]] had authorized the kiosk, but sidewalk billboards were not common in Chicago at the time, and their desirability was questioned. Although there were demands from citizens' organizations and the local Alderman [[Burton Natarus]] (who had voted in favor of the legislation) to remove the kiosk, Trump agreed only to remove pricing information from the signage, after a request to remove all advertising from it.<ref name=ThDctdtmohMAha>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-0610270011oct27,0,7209828.story|title=Trump's harrumph: Developer calls to debate the merits of his Michigan Avenue hotel-condo ad|accessdate=2008-05-10|date=2006-10-27|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Kamin, Blair}}</ref>  Originally, one side displayed the geographical information and the other side functioned as a billboard.<ref name=TisfTpks/>

Two earlier business decisions by the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' led to substantial savings of time and money during the Trump Tower's construction. The original 1950s [[sea wall]] was built by the newspaper company to [[bomb shelter|bomb-shelter]] thickness, to withstand a [[Cold War]] attack, and thus did not have to be broken down and rebuilt. Furthermore, the company decided in the 1970s to switch from petroleum-based to soy-based ink, which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant.  This considerably reduces the costs and time for cleaning up the site prior to building.<ref name=ATtrwpu/>

On August 16, 2008, construction crews made the last major concrete pour to top off the Trump tower's concrete core, which was commemorated with an unofficial ceremony. To celebrate the milestone, a yellow tower crane raised a bucket full of concrete and an American flag to the rooftop of the skyscraper.

== Critical review ==
''[[Fodor's]] Chicago 2010'' ranks the hotel as having one of the best spas and one of the best pools in the city. It also ranked the hotel as a Fodor's Choice among Chicago lodging options.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=e1vL7GVGBRAC&pg=PA217&dq=Trump+Tower+Chicago&lr=&ei=0csZS6j7GJDOM4rJgakO#v=onepage&q=Trump%20Tower%20Chicago&f=false|title=Fodor's Chicago 2010|chapter=Best Bets For Chicago Lodging|publisher=[[Fodor's]]|date=November 2009|isbn=9781400008605|page=217}}</ref>  ''Fodor's'' also notes that the hotel has impeccable service and lavish amenities, but also notes that the hotel may be a bit "too decadent", with offerings such as $25 bottles of water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=e1vL7GVGBRAC&pg=PA217&dq=Trump+Tower+Chicago&lr=&ei=0csZS6j7GJDOM4rJgakO#v=onepage&q=Trump%20Tower%20Chicago&f=false|title=Fodor's Chicago 2010|publisher=[[Fodor's]]|date=November 2009|isbn=9781400008605|page=238}}</ref> ''[[Frommer's]] Chicago 2010'' describes the hotel as having the gorgeous views and upscale amenities to provide a place to go to live the life of a wealthy tourist.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7K3TWOqxMQwC&pg=PT81&dq=Trump+Tower+Chicago&lr=&ei=0csZS6j7GJDOM4rJgakO#v=onepage&q=Trump%20Tower%20Chicago&f=false|title=Frommer's Chicago 2010|chapter=The Best Hotel Bets|publisher=[[Frommer's]]|author=Blackwell, Elizabeth Canning|date=November 2009|isbn=0470504684|page=69}}</ref>  The building is praised for its location, which provides as many views along the Chicago River as possible.  Its modern architecture is praised for "contemporary synthesis of adjacent building fabrics and modulations" that preserve the city's architectural heritage and integrate the riverfront setting.<ref name=1otwtb/>
