'''Mary Ann Bickerdyke''' (July 19, 1817 <U+2013> November 8, 1901), also known as '''Mother Bickerdyke,''' was a [[hospital]] administrator for [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldiers during the [[American Civil War]] and a lifelong advocate for veterans.

==Early life==
She was born in [[Knox County, Ohio]], to Hiram Ball and Annie Rodgers Ball.<ref name=deLeeuw>{{cite book|last1=deLeeuw|first1=Ad<U+00E8>le|title=Civil War nurse, Mary Ann Bickerdyke|date=1973|publisher=J.

Together, the Bickerdykes had two sons.<ref name="Schultz, Jane 2004, page 64">Schultz, Jane, ''Women at the Front: Hospital Workers in Civil War America'', Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2004, ISBN 080782867X, page 64.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/289/000179749/|title=Mary Ann Bickerdyke|work=nndb.com}}</ref>

She later moved to [[Galesburg, Illinois]]{{sfn|deLeeuw|1973|p=10}} where she worked as botanic physician and primarily worked with [[alternative medicines]] using herbs and plants.<ref name=Fliege>{{cite book|last1=Fliege|first1=Stu|title=Tales and trails of Illinois|date=2003|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana|isbn=0252070852|pages=91<U+2013>92|ref=harv}}</ref> Bickerdyke began to attend the Congregational Church in Galesberg shortly after she became a widow.{{sfn|Fliege|2003|p=92}}

==During Civil War==

Bickerdyke was described as a determined nurse, who did not let anyone stand in the way of her duties.<ref>Chase, Julia A. Houghton, ''Mary A. Bickerdyke,"Mother".: The Life Story of One Who, as Wife, Mother ...'', Journal Publishing House, 1896, page v.</ref> Her patients, the enlisted soldiers, referred to her as "Mother" Bickerdyke.<ref name="Holland, Mary Gardner 1998, page 34">Holland, Mary Gardner, ''Our Army Nurses: Stories from Women in the Civil War'', Edinborough Press, 1998, 2002, ISBN 1889020044, page 34.</ref><ref>Chase, page v.</ref> When a surgeon questioned her authority to take some action, she replied, "On the authority of Lord God Almighty, have you anything that outranks that?"<ref>{{cite book|last=Livermore|first=Mary|title=My Story of the War|year=1888|chapter=XXIV|url=http://www.ourstory.info/library/1-roots/Livermore/story09.html}}</ref><ref>Chase, pages 21-22.</ref>   In reality, her authority came from her reputation with the Sanitary Commission and her popularity with the enlisted men.<ref>Schultz, Jane, ''Women at the Front: Hospital Workers in Civil War America'', Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2004, ISBN 080782867X, page 119.</ref>

Dr. Woodward, a surgeon with the [[22nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|22nd Illinois Infantry]] and a friend of Bickerdyke's, wrote home about the filthy, chaotic military hospitals at [[Cairo, Illinois]].  The letter was read aloud in their church and Galesburg's citizens collected $500 worth of supplies and selected Bickerdyke to deliver them (no one else would go).{{sfn|deLeeuw|1973|p=11}}<ref name="Tsui 116"/><ref>Chase, pages 9-10.</ref>   After meeting [[Mary Livermore]], she was appointed a field agent for the Northwestern branch of the [[United States Sanitary Commission|Sanitary Commission]].<ref name="Tsui 116"/>  Mary Livermore also helped Bickerdyke find care for her two sons in Beloit, Wisconsin while she was in the field with the army during the later part of the war.  Her sons complained about living in Beloit.<ref name="Schultz, Jane 2004, page 64"/>  She stayed in Cairo as an nurse, and while there, she organized the hospitals and gained Grant's appreciation. Grant endorsed her efforts and detailed soldiers to her hospital train,<ref>Chase, page 26.</ref> and when his army moved down the Mississippi, Bickerdyke went, too, setting up hospitals where they were needed.{{sfn|deLeeuw|1973|pp=12-38}}<ref>Tsui, page 117.</ref>

She later joined a field hospital at [[Fort Donelson]], working alongside [[Mary J. Safford]].<ref name="Holland, Mary Gardner 1998, page 25">Holland, Mary Gardner, ''Our Army Nurses: Stories from Women in the Civil War'', Edinborough Press, 1998, 2002, ISBN 1889020044, page 25.</ref> At [[Fort Donelson]], she realized that laundry services were lacking in the field hospitals.  She packed up the soiled clothes and bedding that had been used by the men, added disinfectants, and sent it on a steamer bound for Pittsburg Landing to be cleaned by the Chicago Sanitary Commission.  She also requested that her colleagues in Chicago send washing machines, portable kettles, and [[Mangle (machine)|mangles]].  She then organized escaped and former slaves to provide laundry services for the hospitals she set up in the field.<ref>Chase,  pages 17-18.</ref>

After serving at Fort Donelson, she was appointed matron at Gayoso Block Hospital in Memphis.<ref>Chase, pages 44-45.</ref>  Gayoso had 900 patients, including 400 Native Americans.<ref>Chase, Julia A. Houghton, ''Mary A. Bickerdyke,"Mother".: The Life Story of One Who, as Wife, Mother ...'', Journal Publishing House, 1896, page 45.</ref>  Like her other hospitals, "Mother" Bickerdyke employed escaped and former slaves at Gayoso.  She had left Gayoso to run errands and returned to find the medical director had sent away the escaped and former slaves who helped her provide care for the hospital's patients.  She left for dinner, but did not return right away.  Rather, she visited [[Stephen A. Hurlbut|General Hurlbut's]] headquarters.  She was given written authority to keep her employees until such time as Hurlbut himself revoked the order.<ref>Chase, pages 47-49.</ref>  She also set about acquiring cows and hens to provide dairy products for the hospital.  General Hurlbut set aside President's Island for their pasture and the escaped and former slaves cared for the animals.<ref>Chase, pages 49-52.</ref>

Bickerdyke also worked closely with [[Eliza Emily Chappell Porter]] of Chicago's Northwestern branch of the [[United States Sanitary Commission]]. She later worked on the first hospital boat. During the war, she became chief of nursing under the command of General [[Ulysses S. Grant]], and served at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]].  When Grant's staff complained about the outspoken, insubordinate female nurse who consistently disregarded the army's red tape and military procedures, Union Gen. [[William T. Sherman]] threw up his hands and exclaimed, "She outranks me. I can't do a thing in the world."<ref>{{cite book|last=De Leeuw|first=Ad<U+00E8>le|title=Nurses who Led the Way|publisher=Whitman|year=1961|page=27|chapter=Cyclone in Calico|oclc=2702953}}</ref>{{sfn|Fliege|2003|p=94}} Sherman acknowledged that she was "one of his best generals"<ref>Holland, Mary Gardner, ''Our Army Nurses: Stories from Women in the Civil War'', Edinborough Press, 1998, 2002, ISBN 1889020044, page 2.</ref><ref>Chase, page 80.</ref> and other officers referred to her as the "Brigadier Commanding Hospitals."<ref>Chase, Julia A. Houghton, ''Mary A. Bickerdyke,"Mother".: The Life Story of One Who, as Wife, Mother ...'', Journal Publishing House, 1896, page 28.</ref>  Sherman was especially fond of this volunteer nurse, who followed the western armies. Bickerdyke set up the field hospital of the [[XV Corps (Union Army)|Fifteenth Army Corps]] for the [[Battle of Missionary Ridge]], where she was the only female attendant for four weeks.<ref>Moore, Frank, ''Women of the War'', Hartford, CT: S. S. Scranton, page 470.</ref>

By the end of the war, with the help of the [[United States Sanitary Commission|U.S. Sanitary Commission]], Mother Bickerdyke had built 300 hospitals and aided the wounded on 19 battlefields including the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and [[Sherman's March to the Sea]].<ref name="Holland, Mary Gardner 1998, page 25"/>  "Mother" Bickerdyke was so loved by the army that the soldiers would cheer her when she appeared.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ah-marybickerdyke.html|title=Mary Bickerdyke - A Civil War Hero|work=legendsofamerica.com}}</ref> At Sherman's request, she rode at the head of the XV Corps in the [[Grand Review of the Armies]] in Washington at the end of the war.<ref name="Holland, Mary Gardner 1998, page 34"/>

==After the War==
After the war ended, Bickerdyke was employed in several domains.  She worked at the Home for the Friendless in Chicago, Illinois in 1866.<ref>Massey, Mary Elizabeth, ''Women in the Civil War'', Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1994, ISBN 0803282133, page 300.</ref><ref>Chase, page 109.</ref>  With the aid of Colonel Charles Hammond who was president of the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad, she helped fifty veterans' families move to [[Salina, Kansas]] as homesteaders.  She ran a hotel there with the aid of General Sherman.  Originally known as the Salina Dining Hall, it came to be called the Bickerdyke House.<ref>Massey, Mary Elizabeth, ''Women in the Civil War'', Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1994, ISBN 0803282133, page 301.</ref><ref>Chase, pages 109-110.</ref>  Later, she became an [[Lawyer|attorney]], helping Union veterans with legal issues including obtaining pensions.{{sfn|deLeeuw|1973|pp=136-140}}<ref>Chase, pages 86-87.</ref>

General Logan helped her get a job in the [[San Francisco]] Mint.<ref>Massey, Mary Elizabeth, ''Women in the Civil War'', Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1994, ISBN 0803282133, page 302.</ref><ref>Chase, page 137.</ref>  She also worked for the [[Salvation Army]] there.<ref name="Chase, page 140">Chase, page 140.</ref>  While in California, she was elected as the first president of Lyon [[Grand Army of the Republic|Women's Relief Corps]], No. 6 of [[Oakland, California]].  She declined, but is on their membership rolls as a charter member.<ref name="Chase, page 140"/>

Bickerdyke received a special [[pension]] of $25 a month from [[United States Congress|Congress]] after Mary Livermore lobbied on her behalf.{{sfn|deLeeuw|1973|p=143}} This special bill was introduced by Representative Long of Massachusetts.  Generals Grant, Sherman, Pope, and Long testified on it.  The bill passed on May 9, 1886.<ref>Chase, pages 102-107.</ref>

Bickerdyke retired to [[Bunker Hill, Kansas]] to live with her son.<ref>Massey, Mary Elizabeth, ''Women in the Civil War'', Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1994, ISBN 0803282133, page 303.</ref>  In 1901, she died peacefully after a minor stroke{{sfn|deLeeuw|1973|pp=148-149}}<ref>Chase, page 142.</ref> and was buried in Galesburg.{{sfn|Fliege|2003|p=94}}

==Legacy==
Clara Barton wrote a poem entitled "The Women Who Went to the Field" which honored Mary Ann Bickerdyke, [[Cornelia Hancock]], [[Dorothea Dix]], [[Mary Livermore]], and [[Annie Etheridge]].<ref>Tsui, Bonnie, ''She Went to the Field: Women Soldiers of the Civil War'', Guilford, CT: TwoDot, 2006, ISBN 9780762743841, page 112 and pages 124-127.</ref>

Statues of her have been erected in [[Galesburg, IL]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thezephyr.com/bick100.htm|title=The Mother Bickerdyke Monument at Galesburg, Illinois|work=thezephyr.com}}</ref> and in [[Mount Vernon, OH]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.remarkableohio.org/HistoricalMarker.aspx?historicalMarkerId=352&fileId=128623|title=Remarkable Ohio|work=remarkableohio.org}}</ref> and a [[hospital ship|hospital boat]] and a [[liberty ship]], the ''[[SS Mary Bickerdyke|Mary Bickerdyke]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kancoll.org/khq/1947/47_2_henderson.htm|title=Ships in World War II Bearing Kansas Names|last=Henderson|first=Harold J.|date=May 1947|accessdate=26 November 2009}}</ref>{{sfn|deLeeuw|1973|p=149}}  were named after her.

More recently, a street has been named after her in Galesburg, IL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tspr.org/post/galesburg-honors-mother-bickerdyke|title=Galesburg Honors "Mother" Bickerdyke|author=T.J. Carson|work=tspr.org}}</ref>
