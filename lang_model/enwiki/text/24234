"'''Stranger in Moscow'''" is the fifth and final single from [[Michael Jackson]]'s album ''[[HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I]]''. The song was released worldwide in November 1996 but was not released in the United States until August 1997. The track was written by Jackson in 1993, at the height of the [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|highly publicized child abuse accusations made against him]], while on [[Dangerous World Tour|tour]] in [[Moscow]].

During his visit to Moscow in September, Jackson came up with the song "Stranger in Moscow" which would be released on his 1995 album ''HIStory''. It was during a time when Jackson felt very alone, far away from his family and friends, yet every night throughout his tours fans would stay by his hotel and support him. The song's [[music video]] depicts the lives of six individuals, including Jackson, who are left isolated and disconnected from the world around them. The imagery in the video has been replicated in television adverts.

Upon its initial release, and years later after the singer's death, the song has garnered some of the best critical praise of Jackson's career. Many former collaborators and critics have gone so far as to say it is  Jackson's best song.

==Context, production and music==

In the book, ''The Many Faces of Michael Jackson'', author Lee Pinkerton, like many other reviewers, noted that ''HIStory'''s album tracks like "Stranger in Moscow", were Jackson's response to recent events in his personal life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pinkerton|first=Lee|title=The Many Faces of Michael Jackson |publisher=Music Sales Distribution |year=1998 |page=34 |isbn=0711967830}}</ref> In 1993, the relationship between Jackson and the press soured entirely when he was accused of [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|child sexual abuse]]. Although never charged with a crime, Jackson was subject to intense media scrutiny while the criminal investigation took place. Complaints about the coverage and media included using sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline,<ref>Campbell (1995), p. 42<U+2013>45</ref> accepting stories of Jackson's alleged criminal activity in return for money,<ref name = "campbell 77-80">Campbell (1995), p. 77<U+2013>80</ref> accepting leaked material from the police investigation in return for money paid,<ref>Campbell (1995), p. 47<U+2013>50</ref> deliberately using pictures of Jackson's appearance at its worst,<ref name = "tara 500-507">Taraborrelli, p. 500<U+2013>507</ref> a lack of objectivity<ref name = "tara 500-507"/> and using headlines that strongly implied Jackson's guilt.<ref name = "tara 500-507"/>

At the time, Jackson said of the media reaction, "I will say I am particularly upset by the handling of the matter by the incredible, terrible mass media. At every opportunity, the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions".<ref name="(find) MJ speaks out">{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n10_v85/ai_14947357?tag=artBody;col1 |title=Michael Jackson speaks: 'I am totally innocent of any wrongdoing.' |work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet.com]] |publisher=[[Johnson Publishing Company]] |date=1994-01-10 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref> The entertainer began taking [[painkiller]]s, [[Valium]], [[Xanax]] and [[Ativan]] to deal with the stress of the allegations made against him.<ref name = "tara 518<U+2013>520">Taraborrelli, p. 518<U+2013>520</ref> A few months after the allegations became news, Jackson had lost approximately 10 pounds (4.5&nbsp;kg) in weight and had stopped eating.<ref name = "tara 514-516">Taraborrelli, p. 514<U+2013>516</ref> Jackson's health had deteriorated to the extent that he canceled the remainder of his [[Dangerous World Tour|''Dangerous'' World Tour]] and went into rehabilitation.<ref name = "campbell 89-93"/><ref name = "tara 524-528"/> Jackson booked the whole fourth floor of the clinic, and was put on a Valium IV to wean him from painkillers.<ref name = "campbell 89-93"/><ref name = "tara 524-528"/><ref name="HIStory review NYT"/> The singer's spokesperson told reporters that Jackson was "barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level".<ref name = "tara 524-528"/> While in the clinic, Jackson took part in group and one-on-one therapy sessions.<ref name = "campbell 89-93">Campbell (1995), p. 89<U+2013>93</ref><ref name = "tara 524-528">Taraborrelli, p. 524<U+2013>528</ref>

When Jackson left the US to go into rehabilitation, the media showed the singer little sympathy. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' held a "Spot the Jacko" contest, offering readers a trip to [[Walt Disney World]] if they could correctly predict where the entertainer would appear next.<ref name = "campbell 89-93"/> A ''[[Daily Express]]'' headline read, "Drug Treatment Star Faces Life on the Run", while a ''[[News of the World]]'' headline accused Jackson of being a [[fugitive]]. These tabloids also falsely alleged that Jackson had traveled to Europe to have [[cosmetic surgery]] that would make him unrecognizable on his return.<ref name = "campbell 89-93"/> [[Geraldo Rivera]] set up a mock trial, with a jury made up of audience members, even though Jackson had not been charged with a crime.<ref>Campbell (1995), p. 104<U+2013>106</ref>

}}
The song was well received amongst critics and music producers. James Hunter of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' commented "[Jackson is] angry, miserable, tortured, inflammatory, furious about what he calls, in 'Stranger in Moscow', a 'swift and sudden fall from grace'...''HIStory'' feels like the work of someone with a bad case of ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'' nostalgia. Occasionally this backward focus works to Jackson's advantage: On 'Stranger in Moscow' he remembers the synth-pop '80s while constructing wracked claims of danger and loneliness that rival any Seattle rocker's p??in{{sic}}".<ref name="RS HIStory">{{cite news|first=James |last=Hunter |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/michaeljackson/albums/album/312830/review/5943497/history_past_present_and_future_book_1 |title=Michael Jackson HIStory |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media LLC]] |date=1995-08-10 |accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref> 

[[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated, "The ballads are lavishly melodic. 'Stranger In Moscow', with odd lyrics like 'Stalin's tomb won't let me be,' has a gorgeous chorus for the repeated question "How does it feel?".<ref name="HIStory review NYT">{{cite web |first=Jon |last=Pareles |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0DD123DF93BA25755C0A963958260&scp=4&sq=HIStory+album+michael+jackson+review&st=nyt |title=Pop View; Michael Jackson Is Angry, Understand? |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=1995-06-18 |accessdate=2008-09-18 }}</ref> Fred Shuster of the ''[[Daily News of Los Angeles]]'' described it as, "a lush, gorgeous minor-key ballad with one of the album's catchiest choruses"<ref name="''Daily News of Los Angeles on HIStory">Fred Shuster, Jackson attempts to rewrite 'history', ''Daily News of Los Angeles'', 1995-06-18</ref> 

[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] noted of ''HIStory'', "Jackson produces some well-crafted pop that ranks with his best material...'Stranger in Moscow' is one of his most haunting ballads.<ref name="ALG HIStory">{{cite web |first=Stephen |last=Erlewine |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r216079|pure_url=yes}} |title=Michael Jackson HIStory Overview |work=[[Allmusic|Allmusic.com]] |publisher=Rovi Corporation |accessdate=2010-01-27}}</ref> Long time collaborator  [[Bruce Swedien]], has described "Stranger in Moscow" as one of the best songs Jackson had ever done.<ref name="mjvisionary"/> Patrick Macdonald of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' described "Stranger in Moscow" as "a pretty ballad interspersed with sounds of rain."<ref name="The Seattle Times on HIStory">{{cite web |first=Patrick |last=Macdonald |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950621&slug=2127467 |title=`History' Lesson: Jackson's Living On Past Glories |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |publisher=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=1995-06-21 |accessdate=2008-11-07 }}</ref> Further praise came in 2005 when it was felt that the song had successfully portrayed "eerie loneliness" and was characterized as beautiful by Josephine Zohny

Chris Willman of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated "'Stranger in Moscow', is a step removed from the focused paranoia of much of the rest of the album, more akin to the deeper, fuzzier dread of a past perennial like '[[Billie Jean]]'. Jackson imagines himself alone and adrift in a psychic Russia, pre-glasnost, hunted by an unseen KGB: 'Here abandoned in my fame / Armageddon of the brain', he sings in the somber, constricted verses, before a sweeping coda kicks up four minutes in and the stalkee suddenly breaks his cool to wail about a desolate, inconsolable loneliness. Here, in this song, is the real genius<U+2014>and probably real personhood<U+2014>of Michael Jackson".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/music/la-archive-history-review-story,0,2144828.story |title=Pop Music Review: Hits and Missives |author=Chris Williams |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |date=1995-06-18 |accessdate=2010-01-27}}</ref>

Rod Temperton, one of Jackson's songwriters from his earlier career, believes that this is his best song.<ref>http://tripatlas.com/Stranger_in_Moscow</ref>

==Music video plot and influence==
[[Image:Michael Jackson Stranger in Moscow screenshot.JPG|thumb|Jackson walking the streets of the city in the music video.]]
The song's [[music video]], directed by Nick Brandt, and shot in Los Angeles, is focused around six unrelated people living in a cityscape while the rest of the world moves around them in slow motion. The first half of the video introduces these figures. They are a man looking down at the city from his bedroom window, a woman sitting alone in a coffee shop, a homeless man lying on the damp street, a lone figure feeding pigeons, a boy ostracized from a game of baseball, and Jackson himself is the sixth figure, seen walking the city streets. Special effects are used to show birds and wasps flying, glass breaking and coffee spilling, all in slow motion.

In the second half of the scenario, heavy rain descends on the city and the citizens try to flee, all again seen in slow motion. From the safety of shelter, the six "strangers" watch everyone's futile attempts to avoid the sudden change in weather. Eventually they decide to go outside, where they look up at the sky and allow the rain to soak them. The video ends with Michael whipping his hair. During this scene, you hear a voice speaking softly in Russian, a reference to Moscow.

Jackson's biographer [[J. Randy Taraborrelli]], has stated that the video is based on Jackson's real life. The singer used to walk alone at night looking for new friends, even at the peak of his musical popularity. The 1980s saw the singer become deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, "Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends&nbsp;...I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home".<ref name="Associated press on HIStory lyrics a decade on"/><ref>Taraborrelli, p. 206</ref>

==Live Performances==
Jackson first performed the song during the [[HIStory World Tour]], which also turned out to be the last live performance of the song. The song was also due to be performed for the [[This Is It (Michael Jackson concerts)|This Is It]] concert series, but the shows were cancelled due to his untimely death.

==Cover versions==
The German electronica group [[Transformer di Roboter]] released a cover version of "Stranger in Moscow" on their MySpace page on January 1, 2002. The bass line of the track was replicated using the iconic [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[Macintosh]] startup chime.
