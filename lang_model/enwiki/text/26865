The '''Queen's Park Oval''' is a [[sports stadium]] in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Privately owned by the [[Queen's Park Cricket Club]], it is currently the largest capacity cricket ground in the [[West Indies]] with seating for about 25,000. It has hosted more [[Test cricket|Test matches]] than any other ground in the Caribbean, and also hosted a number of [[One Day International]] matches, including many [[World Series Cricket]] games and matches of the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. The [[Trinidad and Tobago cricket team]] play most of their home matches at the ground,<ref name="cricpro" /> and it is the home ground of the [[Caribbean Premier League]] team [[Trinidad and Tobago Red Steel]].

Considered one of the most picturesque West Indian cricket venues,<ref name="cricpro" /> the ground first hosted a Test match in February 1930 when [[England cricket team|England]] toured the [[Caribbean]], though it had previously hosted many [[first class cricket|first class]] tours as early as the 1897 tour under [[Lord Hawke]].<ref name="cricpro">{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wc2007/content/ground/59475.html | title=Queen's Park Oval | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref> The pavilion dates back to 1896, though there were extensive renovations in the 1950s and in 2007 prior to the World Cup and following an earthquake.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/279573.html | title=Queen's Park Oval pavilion unveiled | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | date=February 8, 2007 | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/281808.html | title=Earthquake shakes Antigua and Trinidad | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | date=February 27, 2007 | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref> The 'Concrete Stand' was renamed the [[Learie Constantine]] Stand in recognition of that former West Indies cricketer. The first ODI match at the ground was played in March 1983, and the first [[Twenty20 International]] in 2009.<ref name="cricpro" /> 

Besides the main cricket stadium, the facility includes a Gym, indoor and outdoor cricket practice nets, two [[Squash (sport)|squash]] courts and two outdoor [[tennis]] courts. The cricket field has also been used to host several domestic and international [[association football|football]] matches, and several music events.

==History==
===Early years===
[[File:Ranji 1897 page 173 Lord Hawke running out to drive.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Lord Hawke]], who led the earliest first-class tours to the ground.]]
The Queen's Park Oval Cricket Club leased the Queen's Park Oval in 1896, moving there from its first home at the [[Queen's Park Savannah]], where it had existed since its founding in 1891.<ref name="QPCChistory">{{cite web | url=http://www.qpcc.com/content/club-history | title=Queen's Park Cricket Club - A History | publisher=Queen's Park Cricket Club | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> The natural soil at the ground prevented turf wickets from being laid down, so groundsmen quickly laid a pitch of clay, with a wicket made of matting prepared on top.<ref name="cricpro" /> A popular venue due to its capacity (7,000 when first constructed, the highest in the Carribean) the ground was very profitable for the owning cricket club.<ref name="cricpro" /> The first recorded match took place there on January 29, 1897, between [[Lord Hawke]]'s touring party and an XI fronted by the Queen's Park Oval. The match, which was a draw but saw the ground's first century - 119 by [[Plum Warner]] - was not counted as [[First class cricket|first-class]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/135/135035.html | title=Queen's Park v Lord Hawke's XI Lord Hawke's XI in West Indies 1896/97 | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> Only a few days later on February 1, however, the ground's maiden first-class fixture took place between [[Trinidad cricket team|Trinidad]] and the same Lord Hawke's XI. The home team won by 137 runs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4703.html | title=Trinidad v Lord Hawke's XI Lord Hawke's XI in West Indies 1896/97 | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> The fixture repeated itself on February 5, when Trinidad were victorious once more.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4704.html | title=Trinidad v Lord Hawke's XI (Second Match) Lord Hawke's XI in West Indies 1896/97 | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> [[Arthur Priestley]]'s touring eleven then played a Queen's Park XI on February 12, with the game drawn.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/135/135029.html | title=Queen's Park v A Priestley's XI A Priestley's XI in West Indies 1896/97 | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> 

Touring matches such as these were the mainstay of cricket at the ground for the first few years. However in April 1899 Trinidad played a [[Barbados]]-based XI led by [[Arthur Bertram St Hill|Arthur St. Hill]], an early domestic West Indian fixture. By 1900, [[Inter-Colonial Tournament]] matches were taking place, with the final between Barbados and [[British Guiana]] taking place at the Queen's Park Oval.<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval">{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/30/1791_f.html | title=First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> These became more and more frequent in the first decade of the 20th Century, along with more tour games against the invitational XIs of [[Richard Bennett (cricketer)|Richard Bennett]] and [[John Egerton, 4th Earl of Ellesmere|Lord Brackley]].<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" /> The ground hosted the finals of the 1906 and 1910 Inter-Colonial Tournaments.

In 1911 and in 1913 the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] toured the West Indies, with four matches played in total between the MCC and Trinidad at the Queen's Park Oval across both tours. Then, on February 20, 1913, the MCC played a combined [[West Indies cricket team]], who were playing one of their earliest matches as a representative eleven, and only their fourth against an MCC side.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/1/1356/First-Class_Matches.html | title=First-Class Matches Played By West Indies | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> [[Harry Ince]] scored 167 in the West Indian first innings, [[Richard Ollivierre]] took a five-wicket haul and [[Joseph Rogers]] took a six-for as the MCC slid to a heavy defeat. The match was the first between the West Indies and the MCC to have taken place at the Queen's Park Oval.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/8/8939.html | title=West Indies v Marylebone Cricket Club Marylebone Cricket Club in West Indies 1912/13 | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref><ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" /> Though cricket was largely interrupted by the [[First World War]], normal practice resumed with the ground hosting the Inter-Colonial Tournament finals in 1921, 1925 and 1929.<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" />

===Test matches===

On February 1, 1930, the Queen's Park Oval hosted its first Test match. The Second Test of the MCC 1929-30 tour of the West Indies saw England under [[Les Ames]] defeat the West Indies under [[Errol Hunte]] thanks largely to a century by the England captain and a double-century by [[Patsy Hendren]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/13/13366.html | title=West Indies v England Marylebone Cricket Club in West Indies 1929/30 (2nd Test) | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> The Ground also hosted the Second Test of the 1935 tour, which started on January 24. This time the West Indies recorded their first Test match victory at the ground, defeating [[Bob Wyatt]]'s England by 217 runs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/15/15287.html | title=West Indies v England Marylebone Cricket Club in West Indies 1934/35 (2nd Test) | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> In between the Tests the ground had also hosted several of the first-class matches of the tour, as well as continuing to host matches of the Inter-Colonial Tournament, including the 1935 and 1937 finals.<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" />
[[File:Sunny Gavaskar Sahara.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Sunil Gavaskar]] of India, the most successful century-maker for Test matches at the Queen's Park Oval, with the most hundreds (5) and the highest score (220).]]

The outbreak of the [[Second World War]] halted Test cricket at the ground after this 1935 tour, however domestic cricket continued. 1939 represented the last year of the Inter-Colonial Tournament, and throughout the war years the Queen's Park Oval would host several first-class games between Trinidad and either Barbados or British Guiana. International cricket would not return to the ground until 1947 when the MCC returned and played Trinidad twice at the ground in the lead up to the first post-war Test at the Queen's Park Oval on February 11, 1948. England drew with the West Indies - under [[Clyde Walcott]] - despite centuries from both West Indian openers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/18/18372.html | title=West Indies v England Marylebone Cricket Club in West Indies 1947/48 (2nd Test) | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> In 1952 the original pavilion was replaced with a two-tier structure as part of an extensive renovation of the ground.<ref name="cricpro" /> In 1953 [[India cricket team|India]] toured the West Indies and played the First and Third Tests at the ground. The Oval then hosted England once more, on May 17 1954, and the home team scored 681/8d, which remains the highest team score at the ground.<ref name="stats.espncricinfo">{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/team/highest_innings_totals.html?class=1;id=208;type=ground | title=Records / Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad / Test matches / Highest totals | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref> [[Everton Weekes]] scored 206 of the runs, the second of two double centuries scored by him at the Oval, following a knock of 207 during the aforementioned tour by India.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/30/1791/t_Centuries.html | title=Centuries Scored At The Queen's Park Oval | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=22 December 2013}}</ref>This was the final match played on the clay surface with matting laid on top. From hereon after greater effort was made to prepare turf wickets in an attempt to balance batting and bowling at the Oval.<ref name="cricpro" /> Later that year the ground hosted the second Test of an Australian tour.<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" /> Pakistan came in 1957, followed by England two years later and then India once more in 1961. The ground hosted two Tests of the series on each occasion.<ref name="Test Matches Played At The Queen's Park Oval">{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/30/1791_t.html | title=Test Matches Played At The Queen's Park Oval | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref>

From 1958 the [[Beaumont Cup]] was also competed  at the Queen's Park Oval, and from 1964 the [[Regional Four Day Competition]] also began, with the ground hosting Trinidad home games for both competitions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/313447.html | title=First-class domestic competitons | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> Australia returned to the ground in 1965 for the Second and Fifth Tests of the tour. The latter saw a heavy West Indian defeat, however across the series they were victorious 2:1 in what ''[[Wisden]]'' called the "series for the unofficial championship of the world."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155227.html | title=Australia in the West Indies, 1964-65 | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> The West Indian first-class domestic tournament, now renamed the [[Shell Shield]], continued at the ground in the winter of 1965. England under [[Colin Cowdrey]] returned in January 1968 - and during this match at the Queen's Park Oval a generous declaration by [[Gary Sobers]] allowed England to win and level the series - followed by India in 1971.<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" /> On this tour India were victorious, the first time they had ever been so against the West Indies in the Carribean. The score of 220 made by Indian [[Sunil Gavaskar]] at the Queen's Park Oval during the Test match there remains the highest score made by any player at the ground.<ref name="stats.espncricinfo_b">{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_innings.html?class=1;id=208;type=ground | title=Records / Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad / Test matches / High scores | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref> Gavaskar would also make the most centuries made by any player at the ground, scoring five.<ref name="stats.espncricinfo_c">{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_hundreds_career.html?class=1;id=208;type=ground | title=Records / Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad / Test matches / Most hundreds | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref> The bowling analysis of 9/95 by West Indian [[Jack Noreiga]] was also made during the same tour and remains the best bowling analysis at the Queen's Park Oval.<ref name="stats.espncricinfo_e">{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/best_figures_innings.html?class=1;id=208;type=ground | title=Records / Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad / Test matches / Best bowling figures in an innings | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref>
New Zealand returned that winter, followed by an Australian tour over the winter of 1972-73.<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" />

===West Indian ascendency===
[[File:Curtly ambrose2 crop.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Curtly Ambrose]] holds the record for the most wickets taken at the Queen's Park Oval, sixty-six.]]
The West Indian's had begun to experience difficulties in the final years of the 1960s. The Indian defeat  had come on the back of defeats away to Australia and England. Though they played well against Australia on the 1972-73 tour, they lost 2:1.<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" /> In the Fourth Test in [[Guyana]] they fell to a ten-wicket defeat after being dismissed for 109 in their second innings.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63103.html | title=The Frank Worrell Trophy - 4th Test - Test no. 720 - 1972/73 season | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> The utilisation of aggressive fast bowlers such as [[Dennis Lillee]] and [[Jeff Thompson]] had inspired West Indian captain to bring into his team men of similar virtues. In the 1976 Indian tour of the West Indies, the Queen's Park Oval hosted the Second and Third Tests. The West Indians played [[Andy Roberts]] and [[Michael Holding]] in both games, though India played well enough to draw the first and win the second of these fixtures.<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" /> Their victory in the second involved a record 406-run fourth innings to chase the West Indies total down.<ref name="cricpro" />

Meanwhile in domestic cricket, the Beaumont Cup had been renamed the Texaco Cup, and both it and the Shell Shield continued to feature at the Queen's Park Oval.<ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" /> The first [[List-A|one day cricket matches]] had begun in the West Indies, and the Queen's Park Oval hosted its inaugural [[Gillette Cup (West Indies)|Gillette Cup]] match between Tinidad and Tobago and the [[Windward Islands cricket team|Windward Islands]] in February, 1976.<ref name="List-A Matches Played At The Queen's Park Oval">{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/30/1791_a.html | title=List-A Matches Played At The Queen's Park Oval | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> Several of these games would be hosted at the ground each season.

Pakistan toured the West Indies in 1977, by which time the latter were becoming a major force in world cricket. The Second and Fourth Tests were both at the Queen's Park Oval, and the West Indians comfortable took the former thanks to 8/29 by pacer [[Colin Croft]], supported by Roberts and [[Joel Garner]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/36/36873.html | title=West Indies v Pakistan Pakistan in Australia and West Indies 1976/77 (2nd Test) | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> Further success came in 1978 when two Tests against Australia at the ground both saw heavy West Indian victories. The First Test of the series saw Australia routed for 90in their first innings by Garner, Croft and Roberts and a defeat to the hosts by an innings and 106 runs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/37/37893.html | title=West Indies v Australia Australia in West Indies and Bermuda 1977/78 (1st Test) | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> A six-for by [[Vanburn Holder]] in the Fourth Test of the series, also at the Queen's Park Oval, ensured another West Indian victory.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/37/37924.html | title=West Indies v Australia Australia in West Indies and Bermuda 1977/78 (4th Test) | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> With [[World Series Cricket]] commencing a West Indies tour in 1979, the third 'Supertest' was held at the Queen's Park Oval.

Following a return by Pakistan in 1992, England toured the West Indies over the winter of 1993-94. On March 25 the teams met at the Queen's Park Oval and England were reduced to 46 all-out by [[Curtly Ambrose]]. It remains the lowest total made in a Test match at the ground,<ref name="stats.espncricinfo_a">{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/team/lowest_innings_totals.html?class=1;id=208;type=ground | title=Records / Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad / Test matches / Lowest totals | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref> and with sixty-six wickets Ambrose remains the most successful bowler there.<ref name="stats.espncricinfo_d">{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?class=1;id=208;type=ground | title=Records / Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad / Test matches / Most wickets | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref>

===West Indian decline, 2007 World Cup===

By the late 1990s the West Indian team had begun to decline. They were defeated by Australia in a 1994-95 series, the Third Test of which was played at the Queen's Park Oval,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/60/60360.html | title=West Indies v Australia Australia in West Indies and Bermuda 1994/95 (3rd Test) | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> as were two of the ODI matches.<ref name="List-A Matches Played At The Queen's Park Oval" /> The ground hosted two Tests of the 1997-98 tour by England, the second of which in February saw the West Indies defeated by England.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/65/65367.html | title=West Indies v England England in West Indies 1997/98 (3rd Test) | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> The West Indian captain during the match, [[Brian Lara]], would go on to be the leading run scorer at the Queen's Park Oval in ODI matches, as well as hold record for the highest score made there.<ref name="stats.espncricinfo_g">{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?class=2;id=208;type=ground | title=Records / Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad / One-Day Internationals / Most runs | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref><ref name="stats.espncricinfo_h">{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_innings.html?class=2;id=208;type=ground | title=Records / Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad / One-Day Internationals / High scores | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref> The West Indies lost heavily again to Australia at the ground in 1999, by a margin of 312 runs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/67/67341.html | title=West Indies v Australia Australia in West Indies 1998/99 (1st Test) | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> This, the opening Test of the series, set the tone for a five-nil whitewash of the host team by the visiting Australians.

[[File:Queensparkoval.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Two stands and the media centre and the Oval, prior to the 2007 renovations.]]

The West Indies were chosen as hosts for the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]], with the Queen's Park Oval selected as one of the venues. Renovation work commenced immediately to prepare the ground for the matches. These, however, suffered drawbacks. Labour shortages hampered the efforts of the construction workers. Two new stands at the Queen's Park Oval were constructed for the event. Initially the [[International Cricket Council]] expressed concerns that the ground would not be ready in time, with Development Director Don Lockerbie stating that "that the ante had to be upped."<ref name="ICC inspector concerned with progress in Trinidad">{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/279569.html | title=ICC inspector concerned with progress in Trinidad | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | date=February 8, 2007 | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> An earthquake in late February that measured 5.1 on the [[Richter scale]] caused damaged to the fledgling stands.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/281808.html | title=Earthquake shakes Antigua and Trinidad | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | date=February 27, 2007 | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> Work which had due to be completed by December 2006 dragged into the spring of the following year, with opening matches of the competition due to start in March. Nevertheless the new pavillion was unveiled in time for the matches. It featured a "library and museum space on the ground floor, as well as a top class health, spa, gymnasium and restaurant facilities, and an entertainment centre with satellite TV and other comforts." The ground was celebrated as "the only venue in the West Indies, and one of four in the world to host more than 50 Test matches and 51 ODIs" during a ceremony to open the new stands.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/279573.html | title=Queen's Park Oval pavilion unveiled | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | date=February 8, 2007 | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> Once the tournament had gotten underway, several Group B matches were played at the Queen's Park Oval between teams such as [[Bermuda cricket team|Bermuda]], India, [[Bangladesh cricket team|Bangladesh]] and [[Sri Lanka cricket team|Sri Lanka]].

===Post-World Cup years===
[[File:Queen's Park Oval 2004.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stands and the scoreboard at the Oval in 2004.]]
Following the end of the World Cup, the Queen's Park Oval began to feature international cricket only sporadically. Between 2005 and 2008 it did not host a Test match, and it only featured one in 2008 and another - against England - in 2009. It did not host an ODI in 2009, and only had two played at the ground for the entirely of 2008.<ref name="List-A Matches Played At The Queen's Park Oval" /><ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" /> In 2009 it did host its first [[Twenty20 International]], against England as a one-off match on March 15. The hosts defeated England comfortably thanks largely to a score of 59 from 46 balls by [[Ramnaresh Sarwan]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/175/175378.html | title=West Indies v England England in West Indies 2008/09 (Only Twenty20) | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> which leaves him to date the highest scorer and most prolific run-maker at the ground in T20 Internationals.<ref name="stats.espncricinfo_i">{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?class=3;id=208;type=ground | title=Records / Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad / Twenty20 Internationals / Most runs | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref><ref name="stats.espncricinfo_j">{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_innings.html?class=3;id=208;type=ground | title=Records / Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad / Twenty20 Internationals / High scores | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref> 

The ground hosted another Twenty20 International against Zimbabwe in February 2010. Beyond this, however international cricket at the Queen's Park Oval grew more and more infrequent.<ref name="Twenty20 Matches Played At The Queen's Park Oval">{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/30/1791_tt.html | title=Twenty20 Matches Played At The Queen's Park Oval | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> The ground was not allotted any Test matches for the entire of 2011, a decision which prompted a reaction from Trinidad and Tobago Cricket Association President Azim Bassarath, who stated that "we in T&T need to have Test matches here so that our young and developing players can get a taste of the best form of the game."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/494136.html | title=T&T disappointed at not hosting Tests | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | date=December 26, 2010 | accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref> Since 2009 only two Test matches have been played at the stadium, the most recent being in April 2012 against Australia, and there has not been an ODI match played there since June 2011. The ground does continue to host domestic competitions,<ref name="List-A Matches Played At The Queen's Park Oval" /><ref name="First-Class Matches Played On Queen's Park Oval" /> and following the creation of the [[Caribbean Premier League]] it was host to several league matches of the [[2013 Caribbean Premier League|inaugural season]], including the final.
