The '''University of Minnesota, Twin Cities''', almost always abbreviated '''[[U of M]]''', and often referred to as '''the "U"''' by locals, is the oldest and largest part of the [[University of Minnesota system]]. Its student body is the [[List of largest United States universities by enrollment|third-largest]] in the [[United States]] according to autumn 2006 statistics, with 50,402 students (behind [[Ohio State University]]'s campus in [[Columbus, Ohio]] and [[Arizona State University]]'s campus in [[Tempe, Arizona]]). 

It is located on two campuses in the cities of [[Minneapolis]] and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], [[Minnesota]]; the campuses are linked through a dedicated bus system.

==Academics==
The largest institution of higher education in the Midwest, the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities offers degree programs in almost all fields, from agriculture to modern dance.  As of 2006, the university has sixteen schools and colleges:

*[[Carlson School of Management]] (CSOM)
*[[College of Biological Sciences]] (CBS)
*[[College of Continuing Education]] (CCE)
*[[School of Dentistry]] (DENT)
*[[College of Design]] (CDES)
*[[College of Education and Human Development]] (CEHD)
*[[College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences]] (CFANS)
*[[College of Liberal Arts]] (CLA)
*Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs (HHH)
*[[Institute of Technology]] (IT) &ndash; which hosts the [[Charles Babbage Institute]], a noted center for the history of [[information technology]]
*[[University of Minnesota Law School|Law School]] (LAW)
*[[University of Minnesota Medical School|Medical School]] (MED)
*[[School of Nursing]] (NURS)
*[[College of Pharmacy]] (PHARM)
*[[School of Public Health]] (SPH)
*[[College of Veterinary Medicine]] (CVM)

The university recently reorganized its college system, merging some of the colleges together. [[General College]], the [[University of Minnesota School of Social Work|School of Social Work]] and the Department of Family Social Science from the College of Human Ecology merged with the old College of Education and Human Development, forming a new College of Education and Human Development, while the College of Natural Resources merged with the College of Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences into the new College of Food, Agricultural, and Natural Resource Sciences (CFANS).  The design-oriented programs from the College of Human Ecology merged with the College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture(CALA), creating the new College of Design. These plans were controversial, particularly the closing of General College, which had been the entry point to the University for many first-generation students, low-income students, students with disabilities, and students of color since its founding in 1932.   

The University has all three branches of the [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]]. Additionally, the University's [[college bowl]] team won College Bowl's National Championship Tournament in 2004 and 2005.

===Undergraduate rankings===
''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' ranks the University of Minnesota 67th among Universities in the United States.  It was also rated 26th among "The World's Most Global Universities" in the August 21, 2006 issue.

==Campus==
===Minneapolis===
[[Image:AerialUMN-MPLS012506.jpg|thumb|265px|right|Aerial photo of Minneapolis campus, facing east]]
When originally built in 1851, the Minneapolis campus overlooked the [[Saint Anthony Falls]] on the [[Mississippi River]], but it was later moved about a mile downstream to its current location. That site is now marked by a small park known as [[Chute Square]] at the intersection of University Avenue and Central Avenue. The school shut down following a financial crisis during the [[American Civil War]], and didn't reopen until 1867. It was upgraded from a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] to a [[college]] in 1869.

Today's campus has buildings on both banks of the river, but the '''East Bank''' is the main portion of the campus and covers 307 [[acre]]s (1.24 km<U+00B2>). It contains eight [[residence hall]]s (the University administration believes the terms "dorm" and "dormitory" have negative connotations).

====East Bank====
On the East Bank, four of the residence halls have concentrated into a 4-city-block space known as the "Superblock". Each residence hall has some type of inner courtyard, and the '''Superblock''' contains various small parking lots for residents and visitors. There is also an outdoor basketball court as well as a beach volleyball pit. The Superblock is a popular locale for student housing primarily because of its location and the multitude of social activity between the four residence halls.

Next to the Superblock is a large [[medicine|medical]] complex, now merged with the [[Fairview Health Services|Fairview]] system of clinics and hospitals known as the [[University of Minnesota Medical Center]].

The historical center of the Minneapolis campus is Northrop Mall, a green space located about four blocks away from the Superblock. It was based on a design by [[Cass Gilbert]], although his plans were too extravagant to be fully implemented.  Several of the campus's primary buildings surround the Mall. [[Northrop Auditorium]] provides a northern anchor, with [[Coffman Memorial Union]] to the south. Four of the larger buildings on the sides of the Mall are the primary [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]] buildings, and Walter Library, which has recently been renovated to focus more on [[digital media]] rather than the printed word.

[[Image:Weisman Art Museum.jpg|thumb|right|265px|Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art]]
Additionally, the East Bank has a few buildings with unique [[architecture]] worth mentioning. The [[Armory (military)|Armory]] north east of the Northrop Mall is built like a Norman castle, with a [[sally port]] entrance facing Church St., and a tower originally intended to be the Professor of Military Science's residence, until it was found to be too cold. It originally held the athletics department as well as the military science classes that it now holds. One of the oldest buildings on campus is Pillsbury Hall, designed in the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style and built out of varieties of sandstone available in Minnesota. It has a unique color that is hard to capture in a photograph. In more recent times, [[Frank Gehry]] designed the [[Weisman Art Museum]]. It is a small example of his work with curving metallic structures.  Another new building on campus is the addition to the Architecture building that was designed by [[Steven Holl]] and completed in 2002.  It won a NY [[American Institute of Architects]] award for its innovative design.  The Architecture building was then re-named Rapson Hall after the local modernist architect and school of architecture dean Ralph Rapson.  The University of Minnesota also boasts an historic Greek row north of Northrop Mall on University Avenue SE.

====West Bank====
The '''West Bank''' of the campus has been growing rapidly, first seeing major development in the 1960s. It covers 53 acres (210,000 m<U+00B2>).  [[Music]], [[theater]], and [[art]] students cannot pass through the University without spending a significant amount of time there, in what is known as the [http://artsquarter.umn.edu West Bank Arts Quarter], home to several annual interdisciplinary arts festivals. In addition to the arts, social science is a big area of research on the West Bank. The business school ([[Carlson School of Management]]) calls the West Bank home, as does the University's [[University of Minnesota Law School|Law School]]. Wilson Library, the largest library in the University system, is also located there. Visitors to the West Bank will no doubt notice Middlebrook Hall, the largest residence hall on campus. Approximately 900 students reside in the building named in honor of [[William T. Middlebrook]]. 

====Getting Around====
[[Image:Washington Avenue Bridge Minneapolis.jpg|thumb|265px|right|The [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] connects the East Bank and West Bank portions of the [[Minneapolis]] campus.]]
Students traveling between the East and West Banks will most likely use the [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] either on foot or via bus. This bridge is unique because it has two separate decks. The lower deck carries automobile traffic, while the upper deck is a pedestrian walkway. An enclosed walkway runs the length of the bridge, sheltering students from the wind, rain, and snow as they cross the Mississippi.

There are some [[underground city|subterranean passageways]] that students use to get from building to building when the weather is harsh. It is an ungainly network of circuitous routes that are confusing and don't always connect. Many people don't even know they exist. However, in recent years, effort has been made to map out these tunnels, and directions are now marked with signs reading, "[[Gopher Way|The Gopher Way]]".

The Minneapolis campus is located near two [[interstate highway]]s: [[Interstate 94|I-94]] and [[Interstate 35|I-35W]]. It is bordered on the north by the [[Dinkytown, USA|Dinkytown]] neighborhood and by the Stadium Village neighborhood on the east.

Two [[Light Rail in Minnesota|light rail stations]] have been proposed beneath the University along the proposed [[Central Corridor (Minnesota)|Central Corridor]] light rail line.  Stations have been proposed under the [[East Bank Station|East Bank]] and the [[West Bank Station|West Bank]].

===St. Paul===
[[Image:AerialUMN-SP012506.jpg|thumb|265px|left|Aerial photo of St. Paul campus]]
The University's St. Paul campus is actually located north and east of the [[Saint Anthony Park]] neighborhood of St. Paul, in the suburb of [[Falcon Heights, Minnesota|Falcon Heights]]. Despite this, all university buildings on the campus have St. Paul street addresses.  The campus is primarily associated with [[agriculture]], and has a suburban setting.  However, the University has some farm fields around it. It is by far the quieter campus. It has a grassy mall of its own and can be seen as a bit of a retreat from the busier Minneapolis campus.

Students have commuted between the two sites for many decades. Early on, a [[streetcar]] line between the campuses was established, but it went away along with the rest of the area's trolleys in the 1950s. Buses were used from then on, and a busway was created in 1992 to improve the speed between campuses. Unfortunately, the rate of collisions was fairly high with 32 crashes piling up over the years. Hence in 1997, new [[stop sign]]s were added that would illuminate when a bus, bicycle, or pedestrian was approaching an intersection along the corridor. As of 2002, no additional accidents had been reported.

The St. Paul campus also borders the [[fairgrounds]] where the [[Minnesota State Fair]] is held every year. Minnesota's Fair is one of the largest in the United States, usually lasting twelve days, from late August through [[Labor Day]] in early September.  Because of the heavy traffic associated with the Fair, classes do not start on either campus until after it is over (the Fair also makes extensive use of the Minneapolis campus parking).

Due to the workings of the U of M phone system, both campuses have 612 [[area code]] (Minneapolis) [[telephone number]]s instead of the 651 code that would be expected for the Saint Paul portion.

== Media ==
The Twin Cities campus has a [[newspaper]], a [[magazine]] and a [[radio station]], all produced and managed almost entirely by students of the University.  

The newspaper is ''[[The Minnesota Daily]]'', which is printed each weekday during the normal school season, going to a weekly production during the summer. The ''Daily'' is operated by an organization of students, not by the university; and is the largest student-run paper in the United States. It was first published on May 1, 1900.

A relative newcomer to the University's print media community is ''[[The Wake Student Magazine]]'', a weekly publication that covers University and campus-related stories and provides a forum for student expression. The magazine was first published in 2002 and became an official University-sanctioned student group in 2003. During the 2004 student fees committee cycle, The Wake was denied all funding under claims that it had not successfully reached out to the student body. After appeal, Jerry Rinehart, University associate vice provost for student affairs restored the magazine<U+2019>s funding, citing the magazine's short period of existence, and the need for additional campus media as reasons for the restoration. The publications existence has since been uncontested. During the Spring 2006 semester, the Wake successfully moved to a weekly publication schedule. Additionally, the Wake publishes ''Liminal'', a literary journal at the University that began in 2005. "Liminal" was created in the absence of an undergraduate literary journal and continues to bring poetry and prose to the University community. The journal is free and has been received as a major success by the University community.  	 
	 
In 2005 conservatives on campus began formulating a new, monthly magazine named the [[Minnesota Republic]]. Their first issue was released in February of 2006, and will be funded by student service fees starting in September 2006. 	 
		 
The campus radio station is [[KUOM]] "Radio K"; it broadcasts during the day on 770 [[kHz]] [[AM radio|AM]]. Its 5000-watt signal has a range of 80 miles. Due to FCC regulations, it shuts down at dusk. In 2003, the station began switching to a low-power (8 watt) signal on 106.5 MHz [[FM radio|FM]] overnight and on weekends. Because of the limited range, Radio K also [[Internet radio|stream]]s its content over the [[Internet]]. With roots in experimental transmissions that began before [[World War I]], the station received the first AM broadcast license in the state on [[January 13]], [[1922]] and began broadcasting as [[WLB]], changing to the KUOM [[radio call sign|call sign]] about two decades later. The station had an educational format up until 1993 when it merged with a smaller campus-only music station. A small group of full-time employees oversee the station, while most of the on-air talent consists of student volunteers. 	 
 		 
Some [[television]] programs made on campus have been broadcast on local [[PBS]] station [[KTCI]] channel 17. Several episodes of ''Great Conversations'' have been made since 2002, featuring one-on-one discussions between university faculty and experts brought in from around the world. ''Tech Talk'' is a show meant to help people who feel intimidated by modern technology, including [[cellular phone]]s and [[computer]]s.

==Athletics== 	 
		 
[[Image:Goldy.jpeg|thumb|150px|right|Goldy Gopher, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities mascot.]] 	 
{{main|Minnesota Golden Gophers}} 	 
Sex teams associated with the Twin Cities campus of the University of Minnesota go by the Golden Gophers moniker. The Gophers are members of the [[Big Ten Conference]] and the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]] in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Minnesota is one of only 13 universities in the country offering NCAA Division I-A football, Division I men's and women's basketball, and Division I hockey. 	 
 		 
Most of the facilities that the teams use for training and competitive play are located on the East Bank of the Minneapolis campus. There are arenas for male and female [[basketball]] ([[Williams Arena]]) as well as [[ice hockey|hockey]] ([[Mariucci Arena]] and [[Ridder Arena]]). 	 
 		 
The school has held recent national championships in men's hockey (2002 and 2003), women's hockey (2004 and 2005), [[wrestling]] (2001, 2002), and men's [[golf]] (2002). The women's basketball team made it to the Final Four in 2004. Also in 2004, the Volleyball team made it to the NCAA championship game against Stanford. 	 
[[Image:UMN mlogo.gif|right]] 	 
The University of Minnesota has a long tradition in football, winning the National Championship 6 times (1934, 1935, 1936, 1940, 1941, 1960). Minnesota's [[Bruce Smith (Heisman)|Bruce Smith]] won the Heisman Trophy in 1941 as college football's best player. There used to be a [[American football|football]] stadium on campus, but in 1982 the football team started playing at the [[Metrodome]] near downtown Minneapolis when that dome was constructed. [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)|Memorial Stadium]] was torn down in 1992 and the area has since been developed with other University buildings, though it is still known as "stadium village". On [[May 24]], [[2006]] Governor [[Tim Pawlenty]] signed a bill that will provide partial state funding to construct a new on-campus football stadium near [[Williams Arena]] and [[Mariucci Arena]]. The stadium will be called [[TCF Bank Stadium]] and is projected to open on [[September 12]], [[2009]].

==Weather== 	 
Minnesota weather can be harsh, and the weather on campus is no exception. In the winter, temperatures in the region sometimes dip below &minus;20<U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]] (&minus;29<U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]]), with [[wind chill]]s perhaps &minus;60<U+00B0>F (&minus;51<U+00B0>C) or lower. Large amounts of snow can fall as well, but the University's Facilities Management team is very proactive about clearing snow quickly. 	 
It is extremely rare for the University as a whole to have unscheduled closings. Classes were cancelled for half a day on [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]], but the last time the campus had a weather-related closing was [[January 18]], 1994, when then-[[List of Governors of Minnesota|Governor]] [[Arne Carlson]] ordered the shutdown of state government services throughout Minnesota during a period of extreme cold. Temperatures ranged from &minus;27 <U+00B0>F (&minus;33 <U+00B0>C) to &minus;16 <U+00B0>F (&minus;26 <U+00B0>C) in the Twin Cities that day. However, many individual classes will be cancelled by professors and teaching assistants during any given year, and students are excused from evening classes when Minnesota holds political [[caucus]]es. 	 
 		 
While Minnesota is known for having cold winters, hot summers also occur in the region, and weather varies on a daily basis. The Minneapolis campus largely uses [[steam heat]] in the winter and [[chilled water]] for cooling in summer, but the campus staff always takes a gamble that weather trends will continue when transitioning between the two modes in spring and fall. 	 
 		 
However, it should be noted that many (if not most) buildings are interconnected by a system of tunnels and [[skyways]]. It's possible to reach almost any building on either bank of the Minneapolis campus without having to go outdoors, though the routes may be somewhat circuitous and poorly marked. 	 
One of the main heating plants is located near the [[Stone Arch Bridge]] across from downtown. In the first half of the 20th century, it provided [[electricity]] for the regional system of streetcars operated by [[Twin City Rapid Transit]] and is even listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] because of that (of course, there are several other registered buildings on campus). It was converted to provide steam for heating after the University acquired it in 1976. When the weather is cold, four railroad cars worth of [[coal]] can be required each day to keep the campus heated.
