'''American Airlines Flight 1''' was a domestic, scheduled passenger flight from [[Idlewild Airport]], [[New York]] to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] that crashed shortly after take-off on {{date|March 1, 1962}}. All 87 passengers and 8 crew died in the crash. At the time, it was the deadliest accident in the United States. A [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] (CAB) investigation determined that a manufacturing defect in the automatic pilot system led to mechanical failure, which caused the accident. 

A number of notable people lost their lives in the crash, including oilman [[W. Alton Jones]]; Admiral [[Richard Lansing Conolly]], president of [[Long Island University]]; and [[Arnold Kirkeby]], realtor. At the time, Flight 1 was the deadliest aviation accident to occur on US soil. It was the sixth fatal Boeing 707 crash, and, at the time, the deadliest. As of {{date|December 1, 2009}}, American Airlines Flight 1 still services the nonstop [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York JFK]]-[[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles LAX]] route, albeit with a [[Boeing 767]]-223ER.

== Flight ==
The aircraft was a [[Boeing 707]]-123B, U.S. Registry N 7506A. It was manufactured on {{date|February 12, 1959}}, and was delivered to [[American Airlines]] on that same day. At the time of the crash, it had accumulated 8,147 hours of air time during the course of 3 years. Its last periodic inspection had occurred on {{date|January 18, 1962}} at 7,922 hours of air time.<ref name="cab" /> The flight crew consisted of Captain James T. Heist, First Officer Michael Barna, Jr., Second Officer Robert J. Pecor, and Flight Engineer Robert J. Cain. Also aboard were four stewardesses: Shirley Grabow, Lois Kelly, Betty Moore, and Rosalind Stewart.<ref name="cab">{{cite conference

The aircraft received instructions to taxi to [[Idlewild Airport|Idlewild]]'s Runway 31L at 09:54 AM EST, and clearance to proceed to Los Angeles non-stop under [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR) at 10:02 AM EST. Flight 1 became airborne at 10:07 AM EST. Following American Airlines procedures and Departure Control instructions, the aircraft initiated a left-ward turn.<ref name="cab" /> In the course of the turn, the Boeing [[flight dynamics|banked]] too far, flipped 90 degrees, and began an upside-down, nose-first descent in a nearly vertical dive.<ref name="cab" />

Flight 1 crashed into Pumpkin Patch Channel, [[Jamaica Bay]], at 10:08:49.<ref name="cab" /> Passengers aboard a plane bound for [[Albany, New York|Albany]] that took off immediately after Flight 1 could only watch, horrified, as the airliner plunged to its fiery demise.<ref name="time-1962-3-9">{{cite news

== Investigation ==
The aircraft crashed into a remote area of [[marsh]]land on Jamaica Bay used as a wildlife sanctuary.<ref name="review-1962-3-2" /> Upwards of 300 policemen and fire fighters, including 125 detectives attending a narcotics seminar at the Police Academy, as well as [[US Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] helicopters were mobilized to the crash site within half an hour of the crash for rescue operations, only to find that there were no survivors.<ref name="star-1962-3-1" /><ref name="review-1962-3-2" /> The three-alarm fire was under control by 10:50 AM EST, by which point only wreckage remained.<ref name="star-1962-3-1" /> Low tides aided search personnel in their attempts to salvage bodies from the downed aircraft. Only a few bodies remained intact.<ref name="review-1962-3-2" />

Investigators were unable to recover sufficient body tissue to determine whether the crew had been physically incapacitated at the time of the crash.<ref name="cab" /> Toxicology reports conclusively ruled out toxic gases, alcohol and drugs as possible cause for the crash.<ref name="cab" /> Milton Helpern, Chief Medical Examiner, decided that having relatives attempt visual identification of the crash victims was inhumane, and ordered dental and fingerprint comparisons.<ref name="time-1962-3-9" /> In early July, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] announced their investigators believed that a [[split pin|cotter pin]] and a [[bolt]] missing from the rudder mechanism might have caused the crash of Flight 1. Though considered to be a "mechanic's oversight," the FAA nevertheless wired all 707 operators to inform them of the potential danger of the assembly.<ref name="star-1962-6-13">{{cite news |title= Lost Bolt May Have Casued Crash|first= Walter R.|last= Mears|url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9XcQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QIwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6301,5138019|format= PDF|agency= AP|newspaper= The Free-Lance Star|location= Fredericksburg, VA|date= June 13, 1962|page= 8|accessdate= 2009-11-20}} ([http://theflightpath.wordpress.com/2009/11/17/lost-bolt-may-have-caused-crash/ plaintext])</ref>
