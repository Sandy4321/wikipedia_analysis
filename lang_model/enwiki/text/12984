===Interior===
The authors of the ''[[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Buildings of England]]'' series describe the interior as being "impressive" and "dignified".<ref name=pev/>  The [[arcade (architecture)|arcades]] are carried on octagonal [[pier (architecture)|piers]] with [[molding (decorative)|moulded]] [[capital (architecture)|capitals]].<ref name=nhl/>  The piers at the crossing are massive, having been built in preparation for the unbuilt tower.  At the west end of the church, two bays have been converted into a parish room, with a glazed screen between it and the rest of the church.  The stained glass in the east window is a memorial to the Pilkington family; it was made in 1905 by [[Shrigley and Hunt]].<ref name=pev/>  The organ dates from 1900 and was given by William Pilkington.<ref name=nhl/>
