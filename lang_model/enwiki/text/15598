A '''ploughman's lunch''' (abbrev. to '''ploughman's''') is a cold [[meal]] originating in the [[United Kingdom]], commonly served in [[pub]]s. Its core components are [[cheese]], [[Relish|pickle]] and [[bread]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A5649285 | title = In Search of the Ploughman's Lunch | accessdate = 2009-04-29 | date = 2005-11-10 | work = h2g2 (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) - an unconventional guide to Life, The Universe and Everything | publisher = British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) | location = United Kingdom | quote = The ploughman's is a simple meal consisting of the traditional ingredients of cheese, bread, butter and pickles. Every pub chef will have his or her own version of what constitutes a ploughman's and there are many variations, some better than others.}}</ref> The dish can also include such items as [[boiled egg]]s, ham and pickled onions, and is traditionally eaten with beer. As its name suggests, it is more commonly consumed as a midday snack.

Although beer, bread and cheese have been paired in the English diet since antiquity, the origins of the ploughman's lunch as a term regarding a specific meal have been cause for much debate. The term evokes a historic provenance, but the phrase is believed to date no further back than the 1950s, when the Cheese Bureau began promoting the meal in pubs as a way to increase the sales of cheese, which had recently ceased to be rationed. The [[Milk Marketing Board]] promoted the meal nationally throughout the 1960s.

The dish is popular in the United Kingdom, and is considered by some to be a [[cultural icon]] of [[England]], in a similar vein to such iconic dishes as [[roast beef]] and [[Yorkshire pudding]], and [[fish and chips]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/ploughmans-lunch | title = Ploughman's Lunch | accessdate = 2009-04-29 | work = Icon Nominations | publisher = Icons Online | location = Brighton BN1 1DA, United Kingdom | quote = Accompanied by a good old English pint, there is no doubt that this is classic pub fare. ...a Ploughman's Lunch is a treat in the fields, in a country pub or as a DIY lunch at home.}}</ref> More recently the concept has been extended to a "ploughman's sandwich" containing Cheddar cheese, pickle and salad.<ref>[http://www.sainsburys-live-well-for-less.co.uk/recipes-inspiration/recipes/ploughman's-sandwich/ Ploughman's Sandwich | Cheese Pickle Sandwich | Sainsbury's<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Origins and etymology==
[[Pierce the Ploughman's Crede]] (c.1394) mentions the traditional ploughman's meal of bread, cheese and beer.

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) dates the phrase back to at least 1837, in the book ''Memoirs of the life of [[Sir Walter Scott]]'' by [[John Gibson Lockhart|John G. Lockhart]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.oed.com/bbcwordhunt/ploughmans-lunch.html | title = ploughman | accessdate = 2009-04-29 | year = 1989 | work = OED Online, second edition 1989 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford OX2 6DP, United Kingdom | quote = [1837 J. G. LOCKHART Mem. Life W. Scott IV. v. 161 The surprised poet swung forth to join them, with an extemporized sandwich, that looked like a ploughman's luncheon, in his hand.]}}</ref> but this stray early use may have meant merely the sum of its parts, "a lunch for a ploughman". Until recently, the OED's next citation was only from 1970, indicating a long period of time when the expression was virtually unknown.

The July 1956 ''Monthly Bulletin'' of the Brewers' Society describes activities of the Cheese Bureau, which it says <blockquote>exists for the admirable purpose of popularising cheese and, as a corollary, the public house lunch of bread, beer, cheese and pickle. This traditional combination was broken by rationing; the Cheese Bureau hopes, by demonstrating the natural affinity of the two parties, to effect a remarriage".<ref name="zythophile" /></blockquote> This implies that a "traditional combination" of bread, beer, cheese and pickle was popular before [[rationing in the United Kingdom]] (which followed [[World War II]]). Author [[Adrian Bell]] at the time said: "There's a pub quite close to where I live where ... all you need say is, 'Ploughboy's Lunch, Harry, please'. And in a matter of minutes a tray is handed across the counter to you on which is a good square hunk of bread, a lump of butter and a wedge of cheese, and pickled onions, along with your pint of beer".<ref name="zythophile" /> Only one year later, in June 1957, another edition of the same publication referred to a ploughman's lunch using exactly that name, and said that it consisted of "cottage bread, cheese, lettuce, hard-boiled eggs, cold sausages and, of course, beer".<ref name="zythophile" /> The [[Glasgow]] newspaper ''The Bulletin'' from 15 April 1958<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KhtBAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oagMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6436,3828087&hl=en|title=The Minister Who Slept On Slag Heaps| publisher=The Bulletin|date=15 April 1958|quote = It was called a ploghman's lunch and consisted of a chunk of break, butter, cheese and pickles.}}</ref> and ''[[The Times]]'' from 29 April 1958 refer to a ploughman's lunch consisting of bread, cheese and pickle.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.oed.com/bbcwords/ploughman-new.html | title = ploughman (draft revision) | accessdate = 2009-04-29 | year = 2006 | month = 01 | work = OED Online | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford OX2 6DP, United Kingdom | quote = [1958 Times 29 Apr. (Beer in Britain Suppl.) p. xiv/2 In a certain inn to-day you have only to say, 'Ploughboy's Lunch, please,' and for a shilling there is bread and cheese and pickled onions to go with your pint, and make a meal seasoned with gossip, and not solitary amid a multitude.]}}</ref>

In 2005, research by [[Victoria Coren]] and others for the [[Wordhunt]] project<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.oed.com/bbc-series1/list.html#ploughmans | title = ploughman's lunch, Series One Wordhunt list | accessdate = 2009-04-29 | year = 2006 | month = 01 | work = BBC Balderdash & Piffle | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford OX2 6DP, United Kingdom | quote = Wanted: printed evidence before 1970 }}</ref> in conjunction with the first series of ''[[Balderdash and Piffle]]'' on the BBC (first broadcast at the beginning of 2006<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.oed.com/bbc-series1/ | title = Series One | accessdate = 2009-04-29 | work = BBC Balderdash & Piffle | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford OX2 6DP, United Kingdom | quote = The BBC's six-part TV series, Balderdash & Piffle, was broadcast in the UK weekly on BBC2 from Monday 2 January to Monday 6 February 2006, with a follow-up programme on 16 April.}}</ref>) traced the origin of the phrase to 1960. The documentary evidence was minutes of meetings of the English Country Cheese Council, and contemporaneous advertising matter. The BBC concluded that "the Ploughman's Lunch was invented as a marketing ploy to sell British cheese in pubs".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/01_january/20/piffle.shtml | title = Balderdash & Piffle viewers get BBC programme of their own as nation goes word crazy | accessdate = 2009-04-29 | date = 2006-01-20 | work = Press Releases | publisher = British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) | location = United Kingdom | quote = Ploughman's Lunch: The OED had no evidence for this before 1970. With help from Wordhunters, this has now been pushed back to 1960, when documents uncovered at the National Archive from the Milk Marketing Board reveal that the Ploughman's Lunch was invented as a marketing ploy to sell British cheese in pubs.}}</ref>

The 1983 film ''[[The Ploughman's Lunch]]'', from a screenplay by [[Ian McEwan]], has a subtext that is "the way countries and people re-write their own history to suit the needs of the present".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/539903/index.html | title = Ploughman's Lunch, The | accessdate = 2009-04-29 | author = Simon Brown | last = Brown | first = Simon | work = BFI Screenonline | publisher = British Film Institute | location = London W1T 1LN, United Kingdom | quote = The subtext of the film is the way countries and people re-write their own history to suit the needs of the present.}}</ref> The title is a reference to the way the supposed traditional meal was apparently used as way to get people to eat meals in pubs.<ref name="zythophile">{{cite web | url = http://zythophile.wordpress.com/2007/07/16/the-ploughmans-lunch-guilty-or-innocent/ | title = The ploughman's lunch&nbsp;<U+2014> guilty or innocent? | accessdate = 2009-04-29 | author = zythophile | date = 2007-07-16 | publisher = [[WordPress.com]] | quote = Ploughman's Lunch. Traditional English fare. ... In fact it's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs.
