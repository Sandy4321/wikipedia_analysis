'''William Thomas Hamilton''' ([[September 8]], [[1820]]&ndash;[[October 26]], [[1888]]), a member of the [[United States Democratic Party]], was the 38<sup>th</sup> [[Governor of Maryland]] in the [[United States]] from [[1880]] to [[1884]].  He also served in the [[United States Senate]], representing the State of Maryland, from [[1868]]-[[1874]], and in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], representing the [[United States House of Representatives, Maryland District 2|second district]] (1849&ndash;1853) and [[United States House of Representatives, Maryland District 4|fourth district]] (1853&ndash;1855) of Maryland.

==Early life and politics==
Hamilton was born in [[Boonsboro, Maryland]] and received early schooling from a local tutor named John Brown.  He went on to attend Hagerstown Academy, and later [[Washington_and_Jefferson_College|Jefferson College]] in [[Canonsburg, Pennsylvania]] from [[1836]]&ndash;[[1840]].  After college, Hamilton studied law with former Maryland Congressman [[John T. Mason]], and was admitted to the bar in [[1845]].  He then commenced law practice in [[Hagerstown, Maryland]].

In [[1846]], Hamilton was elected to the [[Maryland House of Delegates]], but failed to win re-election in [[1847]].     He was, however, elected as a Democrat to the Thirty-first, Thirty-second, and Thirty-third Congresses, serving from [[March 4]], [[1849]]&ndash;[[March 3]], [[1855]].  While Hamilton was in Congress, even though his district was largely manufacturers and miners, he supported [[tariff]]s but only as a source of revenue for the government.  Other actions while in Congress included his tenure as chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on the District of Columbia|Committee on the District of Columbia]] during the Thirty-third Congress.

From [[1855]] until [[1868]], Hamilton avoided politics and resumed the practice of law and farming in Hagerstown.  During that time, he became widely-known throughout [[Western Maryland]] as an excellent trial lawyer.

==United States Senate==
After his long absence from politics, Hamilton was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate by the General Assembly, and served from [[March 4]], [[1869]], to [[March 3]], [[1875]].  Hamilton was a strong supporter of restoring southern sovereignty following the [[American Civil War]], but voted against the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which granted voting rights to all men regardless of race.

In [[1871]], Hamilton endorsed [[William Pinkney Whyte]] during the [[Governor of Maryland|Maryland governor]] campaign, but regretted the decision thereafter following Whyte's actions as governor.  In [[1874]], Hamilton was abandoned by the state Democratic Party during the nomination process for his senate seat, and was not considered by them for re-election.  Instead, Hamilton ran for governor in [[1875]], but lost his party's nomination to fellow Democrat [[John Lee Carroll]].

==Governor of Maryland==
After failing to receive nomination for governor, Hamilton again stepped away from the political arena, returning to his previous engagements in Western Maryland.  During that time, however, he continued to push persistently for a Democratic nomination as governor of Maryland, which he succeeding in doing in [[1879]].  Hamilton faced future [[United States Postmaster General|U.S. Postmaster General]], Republican [[James Albert Gary]], during the election, and defeated him by more than 22,000 votes.

As governor, Hamilton regularly conflicted with the state legislature, believing they were neglecting the state's economy.  He sought to reduce government waste by abolishing excessive offices and positions, such as the office of Weighers of Grain and Hay, but again the legislature refused to cooperate with his program.  He retired as governor on [[January 8]], [[1884]], retaining popular support throughout the state.  His hostile treatment of the legislature as governor, however, had made the state Democratic party again unreceptive towards him.

Hamilton returned to Hagerstown where he avoided further involvement in state and national politics.  He returned to the practice of law, but also worked to improve the city and county [[public works]], streets, and water supply.  He was maintained a great deal of popularity in Hagerstown and the surrounding areas, and his death following a long battle with illness was widely mourned.  He is buried in [[Rose Hill Cemetery]].
