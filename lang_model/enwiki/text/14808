'''Carbine''' (1885-1914), a [[New Zealand]]-bred [[racehorse]], one of the greatest [[thoroughbred]]s to race in both [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]], was one of five inaugural inductees into both the [[New Zealand Racing Hall of Fame]] and the [[Australian Racing Hall of Fame]]. Records show he was the standout performer in the 19th century and would rank with horses such as [[Phar Lap]] (who was a direct descendant) , [[Bernborough]], and [[Tulloch (horse)|Tulloch]] in the 20th century.

A bay colt by [[Musket (horse)|Musket]] from the Knowsley mare [[Mersey (horse sired by Knowsley)|Mersey]], Carbine started 43 times for 33 wins, six seconds and three thirds -- running out of a place only once due to a split hoof.<ref>[http://www.barnesphotography.com.au/carbine/index.htm Profile of a Champion]</ref> He was unbeaten in five starts as a two year old in [[New Zealand]] before crossing the [[Tasman Sea|Tasman]] to race in Australia where he won nine of 13 starts as a three year old. One highlight was his win in the AJC [[Sydney Cup]] of 2 miles (3.22 km) carrying 12 lb (5.5 kg) over weight-for-age. Despite suffering interference at the half mile post and being buffeted back to last place in the running, Carbine stormed home to win by a head in race record time of 3 min 31 s. As a four and five year old Carbine won 17 of his last 18 races.

His win in the 1890 [[Melbourne Cup]] was remarkable. He set a weight carrying record of 10&nbsp;st 5&nbsp;lb (66&nbsp;kg) when beating a field of 39 starters and setting a new race record time. He carried 53 lb (24 kg) more than the second placed horse, Highborn. On four occasions Carbine won twice on the same day.

At the end of his fifth season Carbine was retired to stud in Australia before being taken to England where he went on to sire [[Spearmint (horse)|Spearmint]], the 1906 [[Epsom Derby]] winner. Spearmint left Spion Kop who also won the derby (in record time). Spion Kop sired Felstead who also won the derby before siring The Buzzard who later stood at stud in Australia. The wheel turned full circle there when two of the Buzzard's offspring, Old Rowley (1940) and Rainbird (1945), both won the Melbourne Cup. Carbine was also the grandsire of [[United States|American]] champion [[Johren]] who won the 1918 [[Belmont Stakes]] and was voted [[Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year|United States Horse of the Year]] honors.  

A notable modern Carbine descendant was the champion New Zealand mare [[Sunline]].

Carbine died on [[June 10]], [[1914]]. Most turf historians would concur that he was the finest combined racehorse-sire to have competed in Australia, judging by his record. 

He is comemorated in the township of Oakey with a life size bronze statue located outside the Jondaryan Council chambers.
