'''Thomas Allen "Tom" Coburn''', M.D. (born [[March 14]], [[1948]]) is a [[Physician|medical doctor]] and a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Oklahoma]].

==Early life and career==
Coburn was born in [[Casper, Wyoming]] to Anita Joy Allen and Orin Wesley Coburn,<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/senators/coburn.htm</ref> and graduated with a B.S. in accounting from [[Oklahoma State University]]. In [[1968]], he married Carolyn Denton; their three daughters are Callie, Katie, and Sarah. Coburn graduated from the [[University of Oklahoma]] Medical School in 1983. He then opened a medical practice in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]], and served as a [[deacon]] in a [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist Church]].

In [[1994]] he ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in Oklahoma's heavily [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[Oklahoma Congressional Districts|2nd Congressional District]], which was based in Muskogee and included 22 counties in northeastern Oklahoma.  Coburn initially expected to face eight-term incumbent [[Mike Synar]].  However, Synar was defeated in a runoff for the Democratic nomination by 71-year-old retired [[principal (school)|principal]], Virgil Cooper. According to ''Breach of Trust'', Coburn and Cooper got along very well and both had a dislike for the liberal Mike Synar.  The general election was very cordial since both men knew Synar would not be returning to Washington regardless of the outcome.  Coburn won by a 52%&ndash;48% margin, becoming the first Republican to represent the district since [[1921]].

==Political career==
===House career===
Coburn was considered one of the "true believers" in the Republican freshman class of 1995, and was one of the most [[conservatism|conservative]] members of the House. For instance, he supported reducing the size of the [[federal budget]] and opposed [[abortion]] and supported the proposed [[V-chip]] legislation. 

Despite representing a heavily Democratic district, Coburn was reelected in [[1996]] (even as [[Bill Clinton]] easily carried the district) and [[1998]] without much difficulty.

While he served in the House, he earned a reputation as a maverick due to his frequent battles with [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Most of these stand-offs stemmed from his belief that the Republican caucus was moving toward the [[political left]] and away from the more conservative "[[Contract With America]]" policy proposals that had placed the Republicans into power in Congress in 1994 for the first time in 40 years.  Specifically, Coburn was concerned that the Contract's [[term limit]]s had not been implemented, and that the Republicans were continuing the excessive federal spending (also called [[pork barrel]] spending) that they had so vigorously opposed when the Democrats were in the majority.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

In [[1997]], Coburn introduced a bill called the [[HIV Prevention Act of 1997]], which would have amended the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Act]]. The bill would have mandated [[HIV test]]ing in some situations, would have allowed [[physician]]s to demand an HIV test before providing medical care, and would have allowed insurance companies to demand an HIV test as a condition of issuing [[health insurance]].<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.1062: Text of HIV Prevention Act], accessed 14 Sept 2006.</ref>

Coburn endorsed conservative activist and former diplomat [[Alan Keyes]] in the 2000 Republican presidential primaries, although he supported [[George W. Bush]] after the nomination was sewn up.  Coburn's congressional district returned to the Democratic fold, as attorney [[Brad Carson]] easily defeated a Republican endorsed by Coburn.  After leaving the House and returning to private [[medicine|medical practice]], Coburn wrote a book in 2003 about his experiences in Congress called ''[[Breach of Trust (book)|Breach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into Insiders]].''  The book detailed Coburn's perspective on the internal Republican Party debates over the "Contract With America" and displayed his disdain for career politicians. Some of the figures he criticized (such as Gingrich) were already out of office at the time of publishing, but others (such as former House Speaker [[Dennis Hastert]]) remained very influential in Congress, which resulted in speculation that some congressional Republicans wanted no part of Coburn's return to politics.

===Senate career===
In [[2004]], Coburn chose to challenge the establishment Republican candidate for the open Senate seat being vacated by [[Don Nickles]].  Former [[Oklahoma City]] Mayor [[Kirk Humphreys]] (the favorite of the state and national Republican establishment) and Corporation Commissioner [[Bob Anthony]] joined the field before Coburn.  However, Coburn easily won the primary with 61% of the vote over Humphreys' 25%.  In the general election, he faced Rep. [[Brad Carson]] (D), who was giving up his seat after only two terms to run for the Senate.  During the Senate campaign, Coburn said that he favored the [[death penalty]] for doctors who perform abortions[http://www.fox23.com/news/state/story.aspx?content_id=BF956298-934E-4B30-B9D3-DC274E134AF4] and that [[homosexuality]] was the biggest threat to America.  He also promised to maintain his medical practice in Muskogee and return there during the weekend as he had while serving in the House.

The election was one of the most closely-watched of the 2004 cycle.  Coburn won by a margin of 53% to Carson's 42%.  While Carson defeated Coburn in the heavily Democratic 2nd District, Coburn swamped Carson in the [[Oklahoma City]] metropolitan area and the closer-in [[Tulsa]] suburbs.  Coburn won the state's two largest counties, [[Tulsa County|Tulsa]] and [[Oklahoma County|Oklahoma]], by a combined 86,000 votes &mdash; more than half of his overall margin of 166,000 votes.

Coburn's Senate voting record is as conservative as his House record.  He received a perfect 100% rating from the [[American Conservative Union]] for the year 2005.

After taking office in January 2005, Coburn, along with fellow conservative Sam Brownback, was selected to serve on the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]].  Coburn is a rare non-attorney on the Judiciary Committee.

In October 2005, Coburn, a staunch fiscal conservative, made several attempts to combat [[pork barrel]] spending in the federal budget. The best-known of these was an amendment to the fiscal 2006 appropriations bill that funds transportation projects [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.03058:]. Coburn's amendment would have transferred funding from the infamous [[Gravina Island Bridge|Bridge to Nowhere]] in [[Alaska]] to rebuild Louisiana's "Twin Spans" bridge, which was devastated by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The amendment was defeated in the Senate, 82-14, after [[Ted Stevens]], the senior senator from Alaska, threatened to resign his office if the amendment was passed. Coburn's actions did result in getting the funds made into a "block grant" to the State of Alaska, which can use the funds for the bridge or other projects.

Coburn is also a member of the [[Fiscal Watch Team]], a group of seven senators led by [[John McCain]], whose stated goal is to combat wasteful government spending.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2005-10-25]]

On [[April 19]], [[2007]], Coburn became the first Republican on the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] to call for the firing of Attorney General [[Alberto Gonzales]] as a result of the [[Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy|controversy]] concerning the dismissal of eight [[United States Attorney|United States Attorneys]].<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2007-04-19]]

====Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006====

The bill would require the full disclosure of all entities or organizations receiving federal funds beginning in fiscal year (FY) 2007 on a website maintained by the [[Office of Management and Budget]]. The bill was signed into law on September 26, 2006.

==Controversies==
===Abortion===
In [[2000]], Coburn sponsored a bill to prevent the [[Food and Drug Administration]] from developing, testing or approving the [[abortifacient]] [[RU-486]].  On July 13, the bill failed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 182 to 187.<ref>{{cite web | accessdate = 2006-07-15
| title = RU-486 Abortion Pill: Developments during 1999 & 2000
| url = http://www.religioustolerance.org/aboru486a.htm }}</ref>  On the issue, Coburn sparked controversy with his remark "I favor the death penalty for abortionists and other people who take life." <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62348-2004Dec13.html]</ref> Coburn also objects to legal abortion in cases of [[rape]], and he has justified his position by noting that his great-grandmother was raped by a sheriff.<ref>{{cite news | last = Quindlen | first = Anna

===Breast implants===
In [[January 2005]], during a Senate Judiciary Committee discussion about [[class-action lawsuit]]s and [[silicone]] [[breast implant]]s, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' quoted Coburn as stating:
{{cquote|You know, I immediately thought about [[silicone]] [[breast implants]] and the legal wrangling and the class-action suits off that.  And I thought I would just share with you what science says today about silicone breast implants. If you have them, you're healthier than if you don't. That is what the ultimate science shows...In fact, there's no science that shows that silicone breast implants are detrimental and, in fact, they make you healthier.<ref>{{cite news | date = [[2005-02-07]]

===Homosexuality===
According to ''[[The American Prospect]],'' during Coburn's [[2004]] senatorial campaign, he quoted a local resident that in the town of [[Coalgate, Oklahoma]], "Lesbianism is so rampant in some of the schools in Southeast Oklahoma that they'll only let one girl go to the bathroom. Now think about it."<ref>{{cite news | last = Pierce

{{cquote|"The [[gay community]] has infiltrated the very centers of power in every area across this country, and they wield extreme power... That agenda is the greatest threat to our freedom that we face today. Why do you think we see the rationalization for abortion and multiple sexual partners? That's a [[gay agenda]]."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2004/09/13/coburn/index.html

===Roberts confirmation hearings===

On [[September 14]], [[2005]], during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee [[John Roberts]], Coburn began his opening statement with a critique of [[Inside the Beltway|Beltway]] partisan politics while, according to news reports, "choking back a sob."<ref name="WP">{{cite news | last = Milbank | first = Dana

| url = http://www.crooksandliars.com/2005/09/14.html#a4950 }}</ref> Coburn then began his questioning by revealing his confusion regarding the various legal terms bandied about during the previous day's hearings. Proceeding to questions regarding both abortion and end-of-life issues, Coburn, who noted that during his tenure as an [[obstetrician]] he had delivered some 4,000 babies, asked Roberts whether the judge agreed with the proposition that "the opposite of being dead is being alive."

{{cquote|You know I'm going somewhere. One of the problems I have is coming up with just the common sense and logic that if brain wave and heartbeat signifies life, the absence of them signifies death, then the presence of them certainly signifies life.
And to say it otherwise, logically is [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]]. And that's how I view a lot of the decisions that have come from the Supreme Court on the issue of abortion.<ref>{{cite news

===''Schindler's List'' television broadcast===
As a congressman in [[1997]], Coburn protested [[NBC]]'s plan to air the [[MPAA film rating system|R-rated]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning [[Holocaust]] drama ''[[Schindler's List]]'' during prime time. Coburn stated that, in airing the movie without editing it for television, TV had been taken "to an all-time low, with full-frontal [[nudity]], [[violence]] and [[profanity]]." He also said the TV broadcast should outrage parents and decent-minded individuals everywhere. Coburn described the airing of ''Schindler's List'' on television as "...irresponsible sexual behavior...I cringe when I realize that there were children all across this nation watching this program." 

Many people disagreed with this statement, including a number of fellow Republican Congressmen who criticized Coburn in their speeches. Coburn later apologized "to all those I have offended" and clarified that he agreed with the movie being aired on television, but insisted it should have been on later in the evening. In apologizing, Coburn said that at that time of the evening there are still large numbers of children watching without parental supervision, and stated that he stood by his message of protecting children from violence, but had expressed it poorly. He also said, "my intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone about saying what I wanted to say."   
    
He later wrote in his book ''Breach of Trust'' that he considered this one of the biggest mistakes in his life and that, while he still feels the material was unsuitable for an 8 p.m. television broadcast, he handled the situation poorly.

===Sterilization controversy=== 

A woman alleged that Coburn [[Sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilized]] her without her consent during an emergency surgery to treat a life-threatening [[ectopic pregnancy]] in 1990. Coburn contends that he had her verbal [[consent]], but he did not obtain written consent. A resulting civil [[malpractice]] suit was filed, but ultimately dismissed with no finding of liability on Coburn's part.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3827/is_200409/ai_n9415889

==Federal budget restraint and earmarks==

Recently, Coburn, along with [[Arizona]] Senator [[John McCain]], has introduced legislation to attempt to reduce overall [[United States federal budget|federal government spending]] by requiring U.S. Senators to vote, individually, on federal budget [[earmarking|earmarks]].  Coburn and McCain recently noted that the practice of members of Congress adding earmarks (and thus, increasing government spending) has risen dramatically over the years, from 121 "earmarks" in 1987 to 15,268 earmarks in 2005, according to the [[Congressional Research Service]].
