"'''The Crunge'''" is a song by [[England|English]] [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Led Zeppelin]] from their 1973 album ''[[Houses of the Holy]]''. It was also released as the [[B-side]] of "[[D'yer Mak'er]]". 

==Overview==
The song evolved out of a [[jam session]] in the studio. [[John Bonham]] started the beat, [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] came in on bass, [[Jimmy Page]] played a funk guitar riff (and a chord sequence that he'd been experimenting with since 1970), and [[Robert Plant]] started singing.<ref name=page93>http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_93.gw Interview with Jimmy Page, ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine, 1993</ref><ref name=Complete>Dave Lewis (1994), ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin'', Omnibus Press, ISBN 0-7119-3528-9.</ref> For the recording of this track, Page played on a [[Stratocaster]] guitar and it is possible to hear him depressing a [[whammy bar]] at the end of each phrase.<ref name=page93>http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_93.gw Interview with Jimmy Page, ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine, 1993</ref>

This song is a play on [[James Brown]]'s style of [[funk]] in the same way that "[[D'yer Mak'er]]" experiments with [[reggae]].<ref name=Complete>Dave Lewis (1994), ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin'', Omnibus Press, ISBN 0-7119-3528-9.</ref> Since most of James Brown's earlier studio recordings were done live with almost no rehearsal time, he often gave directions to the band in-song e.g. "take it to the bridge" - the [[bridge (music)|bridge]] of the song. A band member pays tribute to this at the end by asking "Where's that confounded bridge?" (spoken, just as the song finishes abruptly).

The voices that can be heard talking on the recording just as Bonham's drums begin on the intro are those of Jimmy Page and [[audio engineer]] George Chkianz.<ref name=Complete>Dave Lewis (1994), ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin'', Omnibus Press, ISBN 0-7119-3528-9.</ref>

Prior to 1975, "The Crunge" was only heard live at [[Led Zeppelin concerts]] during the band's "[[Whole Lotta Love]]" medley and their [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1972|1972 tour]] version of "[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]". One example of this arrangement is presented on the live album ''[[How the West Was Won (Led Zeppelin album)|How the West Was Won]]'', where it also appears with "[[Walter's Walk]]" on a 25 minute medley. However, on the [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1975|1975 tour of the United States]] the song was performed almost entirely several times, in the funk jam that would link "Whole Lotta Love" and "[[Black Dog (song)|Black Dog]]" at the end of the concert.

The band's bass player [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] considers this to be one of his favourite Led Zeppelin songs.<ref name=AndyLong>{{cite journal |last=Long |first=Andy |title=Get The Led Out |journal=Global Bass Online  |date=March, 2002 |url=http://www.globalbass.com/archives/mar2002/john_paul_jones.htm |accessdate=2008-03-17 }}</ref>

==Time signatures==

Some of the humor of the song derives from the juxtaposition of James Brown funk against utterly undanceable shifting [[time signature|time signatures]].  One way to count out the song is as follows: <br>

'''Intro measure:''' <br>
1 x 5/8 <br>

'''Part 1:''' <br>
7 x 9/8 (or 4/8 + 5/8) <br>
1 x 8/8 (or 4/8 + 4/8) <br>
'''Part 2:''' <br>
3 x 8/8 <br>
1 x 5/8 <br>
1 x 4/8 <br>
3 x 8/8 <br>
1 x 5/8 <br>
1 x 4/8 <br>
3 x 8/8 <br>
1 x 4/8 <br>
1 x 2/8 <br>

then return to "Part 1", play through pattern two more times, end with roughly <br>

23 x 9/8 (last one ends in the middle of the measure, w/ drums ending on the 5th beat and the synth continuing for a beat or two.)

==Other versions==
Other bands have covered Led Zeppelin's song or played it live:

*The drums at the beginning were sampled by [[New York]] DJs [[Double Dee and Steinski]] for a song called "Lesson 3." In 1989, [[De La Soul]] recorded a song called "The Magic Number," which sampled the section of "Lesson 3" that used the original Led Zeppelin sample. [[Fatboy Slim]] also sampled the drums for his 1996 track [[Going out of My Head]] from [[Better Living Through Chemistry]] from this Zeppelin song.

*The [[Dave Matthews Band]] live jam "[[Anyone Seen the Bridge?]]" was named after a line in this song, due to one of their crew members commenting that it sounded like "The Crunge".

* The [[Joshua Redman]] Elastic band covered "The Crunge" on the 2005 album "Momentum"

* The band [[Camper Van Beethoven]] pays tribute by asking "Where's the bridge?" and quoting "Has anybody seen the bridge?" at the end of their song Joe Stalin's Cadillac.

*[[jam (music)|Jam band]] [[Gov't Mule]]'s 2008 album, ''[[The Haunted Holy House]]'', included a live cover of this song, as well as covers of all other songs from ''Houses of the Holy''.

* The [[Gary Numan]] song "Bridge, What Bridge?" (a b-side on the album [[I,_Assassin]]) is in a similar improvised funk style, and ends with the spoken line "Hey, where is this bridge anyway?".
