The '''Virginia Tech massacre''' was a [[school shooting]] comprised of two separate attacks about two hours apart on [[April 16]], [[2007]], on the [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech]] campus in [[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg]], [[Virginia]], [[United States]].

The incident, which received international media coverage, sparked intense debate about [[gun law]]s, the perpetrator's state of mind,<ref name="Slate Diagnosis" /> [[Journalism ethics and standards|journalism ethics]], the responsibility of college administrations, and other issues. 

Television news organizations that aired portions of the killer's multimedia manifesto were criticized for it by victims' families, Virginia law enforcement officials, and the [[American Psychiatric Association]].<ref name="NBCright">{{cite news | first=Bronwen | last=Maddox | title=Why NBC was right to show those demented ramblings | date=[[2007-04-20]] | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article1680113.ece | work=The Times | accessdate = 2007-04-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release | title =APA Urges Media to Stop Airing Graphic Cho Materials  | publisher = American Psychiatric Association| date = [[April 20]] [[2007]] | url =http://www.psych.org/news_room/press_releases/07-25OpenLetteronChoMaterials.pdf | format =PDF | language =English | accessdate = 2007-04-22 | quote =  }}</ref>

==Attacks==
{{main|Virginia Tech massacre timeline}}
Cho used two firearms during the attacks: a smallbore [[.22 Long Rifle|.22-caliber]] [[Walther P22]] [[Semi-automatic pistol|semi-automatic handgun]] and a [[9 mm caliber|9 mm]] semi-automatic [[Glock 19]] handgun.<ref name=roatimes_nomotive /> The shootings occurred in separate incidents, with the first at West Ambler Johnston Hall and the second at Norris Hall.

===West Ambler Johnston Hall shootings===
Cho was seen near the entrance to [[Virginia Tech campus#Ambler Johnston Hall|West Ambler Johnston Hall]], a [[co-ed]] [[dormitory]] that houses 895 students, about 7 a.m. [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]].<ref name=roatimes_nomotive>[http://www.roanoke.com/vtshootingaccounts/wb/114655 Police: No motive found], ''The Roanoke Times'', [[April 26]] [[2007]]</ref> The hall is normally locked until 10 a.m. and it is not clear how Cho gained entrance to the facility.

Cho shot his first victims around 7:15 a.m. in West Ambler Johnston Hall. A young woman, Emily J. Hilscher of [[Woodville, Virginia|Woodville]], [[Rappahannock County, Virginia|Rappahannock County]], [[Virginia]], and a male [[resident assistant]], Ryan C. Clark of [[Martinez, Georgia|Martinez]], [[Columbia County, Georgia|Columbia County]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], were shot and killed<ref name = "Broder-17virginia"/> in the room Hilscher shared with another student.<ref name=Time>[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1613010,00.html  Witness: The Dormitory Murders]. ''[[Time Magazine]]''. [[20 April]] [[2007]]. Retrieved [[23 April]] [[2007]].</ref> Cho left the scene and soon after mailed a package of writings and video recordings to [[NBC News]]; the package was postmarked 9:01 a.m.<ref name="NBC Package 4-19"/>

===Norris Hall shootings===
About two hours after the initial shootings, Cho entered [[Virginia Tech campus#Norris Hall|Norris Hall]], which houses the [[Virginia Tech colleges#College of Engineering|Engineering Science and Mechanics]] program, and chained the three main entrance doors shut. He went to the second floor and began shooting students and faculty members.<ref name=CNN>{{cite news

Erin Sheehan, an eyewitness and survivor of Norris 207, told reporters that the shooter "peeked in twice" earlier in the lesson and that "it was strange that someone at this point in the semester would be lost, looking for a class." Shortly thereafter, Cho began shooting. Sheehan said that only four students in the German class were able to leave the room on their own, two of them injured.  The rest were dead or more severely wounded.<ref>{{cite news |title=Student Survivors Recount Shooting  |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3048457&page=1 |work= |publisher=ABC |date=2007-04-17 |accessdate = 2007-04-25 }}</ref><ref name="German Instructor Killed">{{cite news | Author= | title = German Teacher Killed at Virginia Massacre | url = http://www.ajc.com/news/content/metro/stories/2007/04/17/0417teacherkilled.html| publisher = Ajc | date = [[2007]]-[[April 16|04-16]] | accessdate = 2007-04-17}}</ref><ref name="Professor among victims of Virginia Tech Massacre">{{cite news | title = Professor among victims of Virginia Tech Massacre | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-victim17apr17,1,295794.story?coll=la-headlines-nation&track=crosspromo| publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = [[April 16]][[2007]] | accessdate = 2007-04-17}}</ref>

The shooter reloaded and fired into the door, but the bullet did not penetrate into the room.

===Victims===
{{main|List of victims of the Virginia Tech massacre}}

Nine students died in an advanced [[hydrology]] class in Room 206. Four students died in an elementary [[German language]] class in Room 207. One student died in a [[solid mechanics]] class in Room 204.<ref name="NYT Diagram"/> Police reports indicate that 25 people were injured; some by Cho's bullets, others when they jumped from second-story windows to escape.<ref name="RT VT injured" />

===Resistance===
Several people tried to help others during the attack, including:
*Professor [[Liviu Librescu]] held the door of his classroom, Room 204, shut while Cho attempted to enter it. Librescu was able to prevent the shooter from entering the classroom until most of his students escaped through the windows, but he died after being shot multiple times through the door. Only one student in his classroom died.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/849070.html Israeli lecturer died shielding Virginia Tech students from gunman], ''[[Haaretz]]'', [[April 17]] [[2007]]</ref><ref name="Baltimore Sun Librescu">{{cite news | first = Doug | last = Donovan | url = http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/bal-students0416,0,803874.story?coll=bal-nationworld-headlines | title = 'I don't think my teacher got out' | publisher = [[Baltimore Sun]] | accessdate = 2007-04-17}}</ref>  Subsequently, a petition was started to rename Norris Hall to Librescu Hall to honor this professor.<ref name="PetitionOnline petition">[http://www.petitiononline.com/04172007/petition.html PetitionOnline petition]</ref>

Virginia Tech canceled classes for the rest of the week, closed Norris Hall for the remainder of the semester, and held an assembly and [[candlelight vigil]] on [[April 17]].<ref name="Vtfront">[http://vt.edu/tragedy/ Tragedy at Virginia Tech], Virginia Tech Website, Retrieved on [[2007]]<U+2013>[[April 17|04<U+2013>17]].</ref> The university offered counseling for students and faculty, and the [[American Red Cross]] dispatched several dozen crisis counselors to [[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg]] to help students.<ref name="Vtfront"/> University officials also allowed students, if they chose, to abbreviate their semester coursework and still receive a grade.<ref>[http://www.vt.edu/tragedy/academic_procedures.php Procedure for the Completion of the Spring 2007 Academic Semester], ''Letter from Dean McNamee to students'', [[April 20]] [[2007]]</ref>

Shortly following the events of April 16, the Virginia Tech Foundation, in conjunction with Hokies United, formed the [http://www.vt.edu/fund/index.php: ''Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund''] (HSMF) to help remember and honor the victims of the tragic events.

This transfer brings each of the 32 funds to at least the level of full endowment, allowing them to operate in [[perpetuity]].

===Campus memorial===
[[Image:Virginia Tech massacre memorial flowers.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Memorial display on the drillfield commemorating the victims]]
In the hours and days following the tragedy, makeshift memorials to those killed or injured began appearing in several locations on the campus. Many people placed flowers and items of remembrance at the base of the Drillfield observation podium in front of [[Virginia Tech campus#Burruss Hall|Burruss Hall]]. Later, members of [http://www.hokiesunited.org.vt.edu/ Hokies United] placed 32 pieces of [[Hokie Stone]], each labeled with the name of a victim, in a [[semicircle]] in front of the Drillfield viewing stand.<ref name="intermediate and permanent memorial">{{cite web | last =Hincker | first =Larry | title =University announces plans for intermediate and permanent memorial to honor victims of April 16 tragedy | publisher =Virginia Tech | date =2007-06-07 | url =http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/story.php?relyear=2007&itemno=333 | accessdate =2007-07-05  }}</ref>

Governor Kaine later created an eight-member panel, including former U.S. homeland security secretary Tom Ridge, to review all aspects of the Virginia Tech massacre, from Cho's medical history to the school's widely criticized delay in warning students of danger and locking down the campus after the bodies of Cho's first two victims were discovered.<ref>{{cite news |

Families of twenty of the victims represented by attorney Thomas J. Fadoul Jr., whose cousin was among those murdered that day, have expressed their mistrust in the commission's ability to be impartial and focus on the question of what more Virginia Tech could have done to prevent the shootings. The families have questioned whether the state can be impartial in investigating a state university. "I believe the panel itself is invalid, because it has a series of inherent conflicts of interest", said Fadoul. The families' requests to have a representative on the panel have been denied.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/22/AR2007062202014.html]</ref>  

The incident also caused Virginia Commonwealth elected officials to re-examine gaps between federal and state gun purchase laws. Within two weeks, Governor Kaine had issued an executive order designed to close those gaps (see ''Gun Politics'', [[#Gun politics debate|below]]).

Also prompted by the incident, the U.S. Congress took action in June 2007. On [[June 13]], [[2007]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a federal gun control law. The bill, passed on [[voice vote]], would improve state reporting to the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System]] to halt gun purchases by criminals, those declared mentally ill, and other people prohibited from possessing firearms. If this law passes the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and is signed by the [[President of the United States|President]], it would become the most important gun control act for over a decade. The [[National Rifle Association]], which supported the bill, insists that this is not a gun control measure since it does not hinder the sale of guns that would otherwise be legal.<ref name="June bill">{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Abrams |title=House Tempers Background Checks for Guns |url=http://www.comcast.net/news/index.jsp?cat=GENERAL&fn=/2007/06/13/688491.html&cvqh=itn_gunlaw |work= |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date= 2007-06-13 |accessdate=2007-06-13 }}</ref>

==Gun politics debate==
{{seealso|Gun politics in the United States}}
The massacre reignited the gun politics debate in the United States, with proponents of [[gun politics|gun control]] legislation arguing that guns are too accessible, citing that Cho, a mentally unsound individual, was able to purchase two [[Semi-automatic self-loading pistol|semi-automatic pistols]]. Proponents of gun rights and the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] argued that Virginia Tech's gun-free "safe zone" policy ensured that none of the students or faculty would be armed and able to stop Cho's rampage. Others argued that coherent and consistent federal and state laws combined with adequate communication between government entities could have prevented Cho from acquiring weapons without compromising Second Amendment rights.
====Background====
Law enforcement officials have described finding a purchase receipt for at least one of the guns used in the assault.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/ny-ustech-main,0,5858464.story?coll=ny-tintboxrelateds-sports|title=Gunman ID'd as student; tests tie same gun to both attacks|publisher=New York Newsday|accessdate = 2007-04-17}}</ref> The shooter had apparently waited one month after buying a [[Walther P22]] pistol before he bought a second pistol, a [[Glock 19]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wdbj7.com/Global/story.asp?S=6388845&nav=S6aK|title=Shooter had guns more than 1 month before Va. shootings |publisher=[[WDBJ|WDBJ-TV]] |accessdate = 2007-04-18}}</ref> Cho used a 15-round ammunition magazine in the Glock.<ref name="wp-2007-04-18">"[http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070418/REPOSITORY/704180366/1013/NEWS03 Guns were easy to come by]."

Retrieved [[April 18]] [[2007]]/</ref> The serial numbers on the weapons were filed off, a felony, but the [[ATF|ATF National Laboratory]] was able to reveal them and performed a firearms trace.<ref name="wp-2007-04-18"/> 

The sale of firearms to [[Permanent residency|permanent residents]] in Virginia is legal as long as the buyer shows proof of residency.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=3048534|title=Shooter Identified as Seung-Hui Cho|publisher=ABC News|accessdate = 2007-04-17}}</ref> Additionally, though, Virginia has a law that limits purchases of handguns to one every 30 days.<ref>Code of Virginia, [http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2<U+2013>308.2C2 <U+00A7>18.2<U+2013>308.2:2(P) (2005)].</ref> [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Federal law]] requires a [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System|criminal background check]] for handgun purchases from licensed firearms dealers, and Virginia checks other databases in addition to the Federally-mandated NICS. A federal law passed in 1968 in response to the assassinations of [[Robert Kennedy]] and [[Martin Luther King]],<ref name="June bill" /> also prohibits those "adjudicated as a mental defective" from buying guns. This exclusion may have been applicable to Cho after a Virginia court declared him to be a danger to himself in late 2005
and sent him for [[Psychotherapy|psychiatric treatment]].<ref name="NYTgun-421">{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Luo |title=U.S. Rules Made Killer Ineligible to Purchase Gun |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/21/us/21guns.html|publisher=New York Times |date=2007-04-21 |accessdate = 2007-04-21 }}</ref> Because of gaps between federal and Virginia state laws, the state did not report Cho's [[legal status]] to the federal National Instant Criminal [[Background check|Background Check]] System.<ref name="NYTgun-421"/> 

Virginia Governor Timothy Kaine addressed this problem on [[April 30]] [[2007]], by issuing an executive order intended to close those reporting gaps.<ref name="VA gun order">{{cite press release

</ref> In June 2007, the U.S. Congress also took up the issue, introducing legislation to improve state reporting to the NICS.

The shootings also renewed debate surrounding Virginia Tech's blanket ban on possession or storage of firearms on campus, even by state-licensed [[Carrying concealed weapon|concealed weapons permit]] holders. In April 2005, a student licensed by the state to carry concealed weapons was discovered possessing a concealed firearm in class. While no criminal charges were filed, a university spokesman said the University had "the right to adhere to and enforce that policy as a common-sense protection of students, staff and faculty as well as guests and visitors."<ref>[http://www.roanoke.com/news/nrv/wb/xp-21770 Virginia Tech's ban on guns may draw legal fire]</ref>

In 2006, a bill intended to prohibit [[Public university|public universities]] in Virginia from preventing students from lawfully carrying a concealed handgun on campus was introduced into the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] by delegate Todd Gilbert. The university opposed the bill, HB 1572, which died in subcommittee in January 2006.<ref name="Roanoke Times gun bill">[http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/wb/xp-50658 Gun bill gets shot down by panel]</ref>

====Political response====
The response to how gun law affected the massacre was divided. The White House issued a statement saying "The president believes that there is [[right to bear arms|a right for people to bear arms]], but that all laws must be followed."<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/04/20070416-1.html Press Briefing] Dana Perino, [[White House]], [[April 16]], [[2007]]</ref> The [[Brady Campaign|Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]] said that it was easy for an individual to get powerful weapons and called for increased gun control measures.<ref name="brady">[http://bradycampaign.org/media/release.php?release=884 News Release: Nation Again Grieves Over A Tragedy Of Monumental Proportions], CNN, [[April 17]]</ref>  Gun rights activist and [[National Rifle Association]] board member [[Ted Nugent]], commenting on CNN, called for an end to gun-free zones and contrasted the Virginia Tech massacre with other incidents in which mass shootings have been ended by law-abiding gun owners.<ref name="nugent">{{cite news |first=Ted |last=Nugent |title=Gun-free zones are recipe for disaster |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/19/commentary.nugent/index.html|publisher=CNN |date=2007-04-20 |accessdate = 2007-04-28 }}</ref>  

Some government officials in other countries joined in the criticism of U.S. gun laws and policies.<ref>[http://news.monstersandcritics.com/usa/features/article_1292565.php/Massacre_sparks_foreign_criticism_of_U.S._gun_culture Massacre sparks foreign criticism of U.S. gun culture], MonstersandCritics.com, accessed [[April 22]] [[2007]]</ref> For example, [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] said that tough Australian legislation introduced after a 1996 [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|mass shooting in Tasmania]] had prevented a problematic [[gun culture]] in Australia.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/17/ap/world/main2697121.shtml U.S. Gun Laws Draw Heat After Massacre], CBS NEWS, accessed [[April 22]] [[2007]]</ref>

In response to the Virginia Tech incident, [[Governor of Texas|Texas Gov.]] [[Rick Perry]] has proposed that licensed gun owners be allowed to carry their weapons anywhere in Texas.<ref>{{cite news | author=Jay Root | title=Perry: Allow concealed handguns anywhere in Texas | url=http://www.star-telegram.com/189/story/86649.html | publisher=Ft.
