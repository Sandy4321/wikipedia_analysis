'''Andrew Cohen''' (b.1955) is an American  [[guru]], [[spiritual teacher]], magazine editor, author, and musician who has developed what he characterizes as a unique path of spiritual transformation, called Evolutionary Enlightenment. He sees himself as working in conjunction with others to bring about a new stage of human [[consciousness]] and [[culture]]. Towards this end, Cohen and his students frequently engage with a variety of spiritual teachers, [[philosophers]], [[activists]], and cultural figures. Many of these encounters, as well as Cohen's writings, are featured in ''[[What Is Enlightenment? (magazine)|What Is Enlightenment?]]'' magazine, which is published quarterly by the international organization he founded, [[EnlightenNext]]. 

==Biography==

Cohen was born in [[New York City]] in 1955. Raised as a [[secular]] [[Jew]], he recounts that his life was changed by a spontaneous experience of "[[cosmic consciousness]]" at the age of sixteen. Haunted by the memory of this event, Cohen abandoned his ambition to become a [[jazz]] [[drummer]] and began a quest to recapture this experience. Studying [[martial arts]], then [[Kriya Yoga]], then [[Buddhism]] from ages 22 to 30, Cohen eventually met the [[Advaita Vedanta]] master [[H. W. L. Poonja]] in 1986.  After spending two weeks with Poonja, and having what he claimed was a deep spiritual awakening, Cohen began to teach, with the initial encouragement of Poonja, until a later philosophical disagreement created a split between the two. <ref name=autobiography>Cohen, Andrew ''Autobiography of An Awakening'', Moksha Press (1992) ISBN 0-9622678-4-8</ref> 

In 1988, Cohen founded EnlightenNext, a nonprofit educational and spiritual network committed to creating a new global culture.  In addition to small groups of students located in various parts of the world, EnlightenNext has public centers in [[New York]], [[Boston]], [[London]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Zurich]], [[Paris]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Tel Aviv]], and [[Rishikesh]], [[India]].  The main center for EnlightenNext is a 220-acre (890,000 m<U+00B2>) retreat venue in [[Lenox, Massachusetts]], where Cohen and his largest body of students currently reside.

Shortly after he began teaching, Cohen began to meet with other spiritual teachers in order to share his experience and engage in dialogue about the nature of spiritual enlightenment. In 1991, he founded the magazine ''What Is Enlightenment?'', in order to share and further this investigation. As editor in chief of ''WIE,'' he believes that "it is on our shoulders to create the future," and sees the magazine and its associated programs as popular forums for dialogue and inquiry regarding the meaning of spiritual life in the [[postmodern]] era. ''WIE'' has developed an international speaker<U+2019>s series called ''Voices from the Edge,'' an online multimedia forum known as ''WIE Unbound,'' and a partnership with the Graduate Institute (TGI) to offer a master<U+2019>s program in Conscious Evolution. In 2006, and again in 2007, the WIE.org website was honored by the [[International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences]] with the [[Webby]] People's Voice Award in the [[Religion]] and [[Spirituality]] category.

In 2000, Cohen became one of the founding members of [[Ken Wilber]]'s [[Integral Institute]].<ref>Integral Institute. [http://in.integralinstitute.org/contributor.aspx?id=4 Who is Andrew Cohen?]</ref> He was a featured speaker at the 2004 [[Parliament of the World's Religions]],<ref>[http://www.cpwr.org/2004Parliament/parliament/programs2.htm 2004 Parliament of the World's Religions: Programs]</ref> and, in 2006, was awarded the Kashi Humanitarian Award.

==Ideas==
Cohen says that his original spiritual teaching, Evolutionary Enlightenment, is unique for placing the traditional realization of enlightenment in the context of cosmic evolution. By awakening to the timeless "Ground of Being," Cohen maintains, human beings can liberate themselves from selfish motives, or ego, and learn to manifest what he calls the "Authentic Self."  This self beyond ego is said to represent humanity at its most wholesome: creative, compassionate, and motivated by an "evolutionary impulse" that is "one with the [[big bang]] itself." According to Cohen, when human beings choose to live as the Authentic Self, they can realize their inseparability from the universe and thereby discover a purpose for living that transcends egoism<U+2014>that is, the "uniquely human" capacity to participate in the evolution of consciousness itself. 

Cohen distinguishes Evolutionary Enlightenment from traditional "personal" enlightenment. In Evolutionary Enlightenment, he teaches, enlightenment is no longer the possession of the individual, but instead becomes the ground of relationship upon which a new culture is created. Cohen argues that the creation of this new consciousness and culture is essential for the survival of the race, and says that it is particularly incumbent upon those individuals who are at the "leading edge" of human development to take this "next step." 

To assist those who wish to evolve in this way, Cohen has developed a comprehensive teaching, the essential elements of which include "The Five Tenets" and "Six Principles" of Evolutionary Enlightenment. An interactive teaching model summarizes the perspective offered by these teachings.<ref> [http://www.andrewcohen.org/teachings/model.asp AndrewCohen.org: Interactive Teaching Model]</ref>

==Music==
In [[2001]], Cohen re-engaged his passion for drumming and formed the jazz-funk-fusion band ''Unfulfilled Desires''. The band plays original compositions and standards, and performs in Europe and the United States. It has released two CDs: ''Enlightened Dog'' (2004) and ''Live at the Iron Horse'' (2002).

==Criticisms==
Some ex-members including his mother view Cohen as a [[Charisma|charismatic]] and manipulative [[cult]] leader.  Dr. Andr<U+00E9> van der Braak's ''Enlightenment Blues: My Years with an American Guru'' alleges that Cohen demanded large cash sums and extreme, unquestioning devotion from his students.<ref name=Braak>van der Braak, Andr<U+00E9> (2003). ''Enlightenment Blues: My Years with an American Guru''. Monkfish Book Publishing. ISBN 0-9726357-1-8</ref>

His mother, Luna Tarlo, wrote a book called ''Mother of God'' about her experience as one of his disciples.  Tarlo argues that Cohen engaged in cruelty, self-aggrandizement and abuse of her and other disciples, and describes what she maintains was her struggle to free herself from his control.<ref name=tarlo>Tarlo, Luna ''The Mother of God'', SCB Distributors (1997) ISBN 1-57027-043-0</ref>

American journalist [[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]] questions "the myth of the totally enlightened guru", specifically in reference to Cohen and others.<ref name=horgan>{{cite web |url=http://www.johnhorgan.org/work27.htm |author=Horgan, John|title=The Myth of the Totally Enlightened Guru |accessdate= |format= |work=}}</ref>

A blog titled ''What Enlightenment!!?'' contains accounts of Andrew Cohen's alleged abuses written by a number of former students from October 2004 to April 2007, when the blog, believed by its editor to have "run its natural course," was closed. 

Anti-guru critic Geoff Falk devotes a chapter of an online book to Cohen.<ref name=falk>{{cite web |url=http://www.strippingthegurus.com/stgsamplechapters/cohen.asp |author=Falk, Geoffrey D|title=Stripping the Gurus, Chapter XXI: Sometimes I Feel Like a God |accessdate= |format= |work=}}</ref>
