'''State Route 282''' (SR 282) is an east&ndash;west [[state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]].  It is a spur from [[California State Route 75|State Route 75]] and connects traffic between the city of [[Coronado, California|Coronado]] and [[Naval Air Station North Island]]. The entire route uses the [[one-way couplet]], with Third Street in the westbound direction and Fourth Street in the eastbound direction. SR 282 was designated in 1968, around the time the [[San Diego<U+2013>Coronado Bridge]] was opened. Attempts to build a tunnel to allow base traffic to bypass the Coronado city streets were rejected by voters in 2010.

SR 282 begins at Alameda Boulevard as a [[one-way couplet]], where McCain Boulevard continues west from the Fourth Street intersection from Alameda Boulevard into [[Naval Air Station North Island]]. Third and Fourth Streets continue through the intersections of J Avenue, I Avenue, Palm Avenue, H Avenue, G Avenue, F Avenue, E Avenue, and D Avenue, passing by homes along the way. Third Street goes by Palm Park, and Fourth Street by Triangle Park; both are at the intersections with Palm Avenue. SR 282 travels slightly southeast towards its terminus at [[SR 75 (CA)|SR 75]] (Orange Avenue), and continues onto SR 75 leading east back to [[San Diego]].<ref name="sdtg">{{cite map|year=2009|title=San Diego County Road Atlas|publisher=Thomas Brothers}}</ref>

==History==
SR 282 was initially designated in 1967 from SR 75 to the Naval Air Station; however, it was not to be official until the [[San Diego<U+2013>Coronado Bridge]] was completed.<ref name="CAstat1967">{{cite CAstat|year=1967|ch=1483}}</ref> However, before the bridge opened, the designation was added in 1968, and the portion of Orange Avenue from the Coronado Ferry landing to Fourth Street was part of SR 282 as well until the bridge opened on August 3, 1969.<ref name="CAstat1968">{{cite CAstat|year=1968|ch=1139}}</ref><ref name=opening>{{cite web|last=Bemundez|first=Yader|title=San Diego - Coronado Bridge|url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/tollbridge/Coronado/Corofacts.html|work=California Department of Transportation|publisher=Caltrans|accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref>

On June 8, 2010, Coronado voters decided against Proposition H, which would have advised the city to undergo further investigation into building a tunnel between the Coronado bridge and the San Diego Naval Base.<ref name=sdutproph>{{cite news|title=Coronado Proposition H fails|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/jun/09/coronado-proposition-h-fails/|accessdate=10 August 2012|newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=09 June 2010}}</ref> This concluded ten years of studies and proposals by the city of Coronado to find a way to reduce traffic to the naval station during rush hour. Critics of the proposal did not believe that the tunnel would resolve the traffic issues.<ref name=sdutvote>{{cite news|last=Z<U+00FA><U+00F1>inga|first=Janine|title=Rhetoric heats up on Coronado tunnel issue|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/may/27/rhetoric-heats-up-on-coronado-tunnel-issue/|accessdate=10 August 2012|newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=27 May 2010}}</ref> Following this, the Coronado City Council voted to abolish the Tunnel Commission.<ref name=endstudy>{{cite news|last=Fry|first=Wendy|title=Council votes to kill study of tunnel|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/jul/16/council-votes-to-kill-study-of-tunnel/|accessdate=10 August 2012|newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=17 July 2010}}</ref>
