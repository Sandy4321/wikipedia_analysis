'''''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell''''' is British writer [[Susanna Clarke|Susanna Clarke's]] first novel; it was published by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] in September 2004 and features illustrations by [[Portia Rosenberg]].

The novel is set in an [[Alternate History|alternate]] 19th-century Britain, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and based on the premise that magic once existed in England and has returned with two magicians: Gilbert Norrell and Jonathan Strange. Written as a [[pastiche]] of nineteenth-century writing styles, the language of the novel hearkens back to [[Jane Austen]] and [[Charles Dickens]], among others. In particular, Clarke's writing combines arch wit with quaintness and describes the supernatural with mundane details. Adjoining the main text are almost 200 footnotes, outlining the backstory and an entire [[Fictional books in the works of Susanna Clarke|fictional corpus of magical scholarship]].

Clarke began writing the novel in 1993, signing-up for a fiction-writing workshop. Through this, she met a group of science-fiction and fantasy writers, including [[Neil Gaiman]], who helped promote her work. She struggled to write the novel for the next ten years and it was not until 2003 that her manuscript was accepted for publication. Bloomsbury was so sure of its success that they printed 250,000 hardcover copies.

Generally well-received by critics, the novel won the 2005 [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] and was longlisted for the 2004 [[Booker Prize|Man Booker Prize]], among other awards.

'''Volume I: Mr Norrell'''<br>
The novel opens in Autumn 1806 in northern England with John Segundus, a theoretical magician, asking the Learned Society of York Magicians why no more magic is done in England; debate ensues, but no answer is forthcoming. A Mr Honeyfoot informs Segundus that there is another magician in [[Yorkshire]], Mr Norrell, who supposedly has an extensive library, which might help them. When they visit Mr Norrell, they are amazed by his extensive collection of books of magic and stunned when he tells them, "Magic is not ended in England. I myself am quite a tolerable practical magician."<ref>Clarke, 16.</ref> Segundus and Honeyfoot inform the York Society of Magicians of this wonderful news, but the members, all of whom are theoretical magicians, are hard-pressed to believe that there is a practical magician in England. They believe all magic died out several hundred years ago. They demand that Mr Norrell prove he can perform magic; Mr Norrell agrees, but only after obtaining a promise from the York magicians that they will cease calling themselves magicians if he succeeds. All but Segundus agree. Norrell successfully proves his skill by making the statues in [[York Minster|York Cathedral]] speak of what they have seen. John Childermass, Mr Norrell's long-time servant, convinces Segundus to write a piece on the event for the London newspapers. 

Segundus's "Appeal to the Friends of English Magic" generates considerable interest in Mr Norrell in London and he moves to London to reinvigorate English magic. He enters London society with the help of two gentlemen about town, Mr Drawlight and Mr Lascelles, whom he meets at a party early during his residence in London. Eventually, Mr Norrell meets Sir Walter Pole, a member of the Cabinet, who he hopes can convince the British government to use magic in its [[Napoleonic Wars|ongoing war]] against [[Napoleon]]; Sir Walter refuses, arguing that "Magic is not respectable, sir. It is not...serious."<ref>Clarke, 79.</ref> However, with the death of Sir Walter's fiance, Emma Wintertowne, circumstances change dramatically. Convinced by Drawlight, that "such an opportunity is hardly likely to occur again",<ref>Clarke, 83.</ref> Mr Norrell decides to bring Sir Walter's fiance back from the dead. Alone with the body, he summons a fairy<U+2014>"the gentleman with thistle-down hair"<ref>Clarke, 88.</ref><U+2014>who makes a bargain with Mr Norrell to bring Emma back to life: half of her life (another 75 years) will be spent with the fairy and half with Sir Walter. Although wary of deceit, Mr Norrell agrees to this proposition and the fairy removes the little finger of her left hand. In return, Sir Walter agrees to help promote magic's use among the Cabinet Ministers; he does not have to do much persuading after news of Emma's resurrection and happy marriage to Sir Walter spreads. Along with performing various illusions for the government to confuse Napoleon's forces, Mr Norrell, at the urging of Drawlight and Lascelles, founds a periodical, ''The Friends of English Magic'', whose purpose is to expound Mr Norrell's views on modern magic. While living in London, Mr Norrell encounters Vinculus, a street-magician, who relates a prophecy about a nameless slave and two magicians in England. Of the two magicians, he says:
{{bquote|''The first shall fear me; the second shall long to behold me;<br>The first shall be governed by thieves and murderers; the second shall conspire at his own destruction;<br>The first shall bury his heart in a dark wood beneath the snow, yet still feel it ache;<br>The second shall see his dearest possession in his enemy's hand;<br>The first shall pass his life alone; he shall be his own gaoler;<br>The second shall tread lonely roads, the storm above his head, seeking a dark tower upon a high hillside.''<ref>Clarke, 131-32.</ref>}}
Mr Norrell dismisses this prophecy. Vinculus soon leaves London; in his travels he encounters Jonathan Strange on the road and recites the same prophecy to him. It is this event that prompts Strange to become a magician.

In January 1808, Lady Pole holds her first dinner party, assisted by Stephen Black, Sir Walter's capable black butler. During this dinner, the other servants do not live up to expectations and Stephen chastises them; each one argues that they were distracted by something strange<U+2014>melancholy music, a figure of a man with silver hair, or the tapping of branches on the window from a forest that was growing up around the house<U+2014>but Stephen and the other guests do not see these things. One night, Stephen hears the ringing of a bell associated with a unknown room in the house. He investigates and meets the gentleman with the thistle-down hair. Believing him a guest of Sir Walter's, Stephen helps him prepare for a ball. The man invites him to a ball in his kingdom of Lost-Hope, which Stephen attends and where he sees Lady Pole. The fairy takes a liking to Stephen and constantly sends him gifts of money and other valuables during the course of the following days and weeks, eventually promising to make him a king. As the weeks pass, Lady Pole lapses from health into lassitude. She sits silently in a chair in her home, rarely speaking; anything she does say seems unconnected and she complains of being tired of dancing. No doctors can cure her and Mr Norrell claims that her problems are not those that magic can solve. The gentleman with the thistle-down hair appears to Mr Norrell and he berates the fairy for "cheating him", claiming that "When you said that you would take half the young lady's life, I thought you would permit her to remain with her friends and family for half seventy-five years. I thought it would appear as if she had simply died." The fairy responds "I never said so."<ref>Clarke, 179.</ref>

Volume II opens with Segundus and Honeyfoot's discovery of Jonathan Strange performing magic; Honeyfoot in particular enthusiastically encourages him to contact Mr Norrell. Strange travels to London and meets with Norrell, but they clash from the outset, disputing the importance of the Raven King to English magic. Strange argues that "without the Raven King there would be no magic and no magicians" while Norrell retorts that the Raven King made war upon England and should be forgotten.<ref>Clarke, 244-45.</ref> Despite their differing opinions and temperaments, Strange asks to be Norrell's pupil and he agrees, however he deliberately keeps some of his books from Strange and refuses to share all of his knowledge. 

While living in London, Lady Pole and Strange's wife, Arabella, become friends; several times Lady Pole attempts to tell Arabella about her forced nights of dancing at the fairy's castle in Lost-Hope, but each time she just narrates an unrelated story instead. Arabella also meets the gentleman with the thistle-down hair at the Poles', but she believes that he is simply a resident. The fairy plots to enchant her, unbeknownst to Strange, although Stephen continually attempts to dissuade him.

The Stranges become a popular couple in London and the Cabinet Ministers find it easier to deal with Strange than Norell. They send him to assist the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] on his [[Peninsular War|Peninsular Campaign]]. For over a year, Strange helps the army; he creates roads, moves towns, and makes dead men speak. After he returns, he unsuccessfully tries to cure [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III's]] madness, but he does manage to save him from enchantment by the gentleman with thistle-down hair, who is determined to remove George III and make Stephen king of England. In June 1815, Strange returns to the army to help defeat Napoleon at the horrifying [[Battle of Waterloo]].

Strange, frustrated at remaining Norrell's pupil after his successful wartime exploits, lashes out by writing a scathing review of a recently published book of magic that outlines Norrell's theories regarding modern magic, but particularly the Raven King. The narrator writes, "Of all the controversial pieces ever published in ''[[Edinburgh Review|The Edinburgh Review]]'', this was the most controversial by far."<ref>Clark, 448.</ref> The English public splits into "Norrellites" and "Strangites"; Norrell and Strange themselves part ways, although not without some regret on both sides. 

Strange leaves London and returns to the North of England and works on writing a book outlining his own theories of magic, ''The History and Practice of English Magic''. A neighbor claims to have seen Arabella wandering around the snowy landscape at night, but Strange dismisses this report. The neighbor returns, insisting he has seen Arabella wandering the heath and Strange discovers she is missing. The entire village searches for her for hours, and then she suddenly reappears, sick and weak. Three days later, she dies. 

'''Volume III: John Uskglass'''

Volume III opens with Childermass experiencing strong magic and seeing visions that are not produced by either Norrell's or Strange's magic. At the same time, Lady Pole attempts to shoot Mr Norrell as he is returning home, but Childermass prevents her, taking the bullet himself. Afterwards, she is taken to live in the country, at a house run by John Segundus. Unlike others, Segundus has an inkling of the magic surrounding her and Stephen. During his travels in the north of England, Stephen meets Vinculus, who recites his prophecy to him: "''the nameless slave shall be a king in a strange country''..."<ref>Clarke, 569.</ref> Stephen and the gentleman with the thistle-down hair discuss this prophecy, Stephen thinking it applies to him and the fairy arguing that it applies to the Raven King.<ref>Clarke, 571.</ref>

By June of 1816, Strange is finished with his book ''The History and Practice of English Magic''. He arranges for [[John Murray]] to publish it and leaves for Europe. While Strange is away, Mr Norrell manages to erase all of the copies of Strange's book. claiming that it is dangerous, and offers to buy Murray off. Murray refuses and Childermass informs him that two intact copies remain: Strange's and Norrell's. Strange settles in [[Venice]] and becomes acquainted with the Greysteel family. The young Flora Greysteel and Strange become fond of each other and Strange's friends believe he may marry again, but in his efforts to raise a fairy, Strange discovers that Arabella is still alive and being held captive in Lost-Hope. To see this fairy, Strange intentionally becomes mad for short amounts of time. The gentleman with the thistle-down hair, who had appeared to Strange, and whom Strange had tricked out Lady Pole's finger, becomes enraged. Strange begins to make every effort to rescue Arabella, writing what appear to has friends as crazed letters from Italy; he is soon surrounded by "eternal night". Flora moves with her family to [[Padua]] and secretes herself inside her home, refusing to leave. In England, people who have never known how to do magic can suddenly perform sophisticated magic and fairy roads which had long disappeared are suddenly opening up.

==Composition and publication==
[[File:Gaiman, Neil (2007).jpg|thumb|left|[[Neil Gaiman]] has helped promote Clarke's work from the beginning of her career, providing this blurb for ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'': "Unquestionably the finest English novel of the fantastic written in the last seventy years."<ref>Clarke, "Praise for ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell''.</ref>]]
Clarke relates that she first thought of the idea behind ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'' while she was spending a year teaching English in [[Bilbao, Spain]]: "I had a kind of waking dream...about a man in 18th century clothes in a place rather like Venice, talking to some English tourists. And I felt strongly that he had some sort of magical background <U+2014> he'd been dabbling in magic, and something had gone badly wrong."<ref name=Grossman>Lev Grossman, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101040816-678627,00.html "Of Magic and Men"], ''Time'' (8 August 2004). Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref>

Clarke began seriously thinking about writing her novel in 1993, after she returned from Spain. She signed up for a five-day fantasy and science-fiction writing workshop, co-taught by [[Colin Greenland]], a science fiction writer and active promoter of science fiction and fantasy. All of the students were expected to have a short story for the workshop, but all Clarke had were "bundles" of material for her novel, so she extracted "The Ladies of Grace Adieu" from it,  a story about "three otherwise respectable women who secretly practice magic...and are discovered by the famous magician of London Jonathan Strange".<ref name=Hodgman>John Hodgman, [http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/01/magazine/01CLARKE.html?ex=1249099200&en=2fea0b3cbfbd17d9&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland "Susanna Clarke's Magic Book"], ''New York Times Magazine'' (1 August 2004). Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref> Greenland was so impressed that, unbeknownst to Clarke, he sent a excerpt to his friend [[Neil Gaiman]], the fantasy writer. Gaiman later said, "It was terrifying from my point of view to read this first short story that had so much assurance...It was like watching someone sit down to play the piano for the first time and she plays a sonata."<ref name=Hodgman/> Gaiman was so impressed that he showed the story to his friend, science-fiction writer and editor [[Patrick Nielsen Hayden]]. Clarke learned of all of this by hearing Hayden offer to publish her story in his anthology ''Starlight 1'', which included pieces by well-regarded science fiction and fantasy writers.<ref name=Hodgman/>

While working on her novel over the next ten years (her day job was editing cookbooks for [[Simon & Schuster]] in [[Cambridge]]<ref name=WGrossman>Wendy Grossman, "Ten years &mdash; but Susanna's book is worth the wait". ''Daily Telegraph'' (London) (7 October 2004). LexisNexis. Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref>), Clarke published stories in ''Starlight 2'' and ''Starlight 3''. According to an article in the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'', her work "was discussed and praised on Internet bulletin boards devoted to fantasy fiction in general and fairy-tale fiction specifically".<ref name=Hodgman/> However, as her acquaintance Wendy Grossman writes, "[f]or much of that time, she had no idea if [her novel] would ever be published or whether it would even be finished."<ref name=WGrossman/> Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, beginning at 5:30 am, but it was a struggle. As Rose explains, "her method of writing compounded the problem as, instead of starting at the beginning and writing in consecutive sentences, she takes fragments of dialogue and description and tries to join them up."<ref name=Rose/> Clarke said she "clung to this method" "because I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning, [the novel] would lack depth, and I would just be skimming the surface of what I could do. But if I had known it was going to take me ten years, I would never have begun. I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year, or the year after next."<ref name=Rose/> Clarke and Greenland also fell in love during this time and moved in together.<ref name=Hodgman/> 

Around 2001, Clarke "had begun to despair": "Colin and I agreed the time was right to find an agent when the whole burden of carrying this huge unfinished book became too heavy for just the two of us."<ref name=Hodgman/> Giles Gordon became her agent and sold the unfinished manuscript to [[Bloomsbury]] in early 2003, after the first two publishers turned it down as unmarketable.<ref name=Rose>Hilary Rose, "Her dark materials".

==Style==
[[File:CassandraAusten-JaneAusten(c.1810)reversed.jpg|thumb|right|Clarke's tone, with its arch wit, has been described as "[[Jane Austen|Austenesque]]".]]
Clarke<U+2019>s style has frequently been described as a [[pastiche]], particularly of nineteenth-century British writers, including [[Charles Dickens]], [[Jane Austen]], and [[George Meredith]].<ref name=Hendrix/><ref name=Brown>Helen Brown, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3623749/Under-her-spell.html "Under her spell"], ''The Telegraph'' (15 September 2004). Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref> Specifically, the novel "brims with minor characters whose vivacity recalls the great caricatures of Dickens, from unctuous social climbers and dithering aristocrats to supercilious rakes and the formidable Duke of Wellington".<ref name=Miller>Laura Miller, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3623749/Under-her-spell.html "When Harry Potter met Jane Austen"], www.salon.com (4 September 2004). Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref> Miller writes that the novel itself is "about a certain literary voice, the eminently civilized voice of early 19th century social comedy", exemplified in the works of Austen.<ref name=Miller/> The novel even uses obsolete spellings<U+2014>''chuse'' for ''choose'' and ''shewed'' for ''showed'', for example<U+2014>to contribute to this feel.<ref name=Maguire>Gregory Maguire, [http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/05/books/review/05MAGUIRE.html?8bu "'Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell': Hogwarts for Grown-ups"], ''New York Times'' (5 September 2004). 5 January 2009.</ref> However, while many reviewers compared Clarke<U+2019>s style to that of Austen, Feeley argues that "the points of resemblance are mostly superficial", noting that "Austen gets down to business briskly, while Clarke engages in a curious narrative strategy of continual deferral and delay".<ref name=Feeley>Gregory Feeley, [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/754gtwvm.asp "The Magic of England"], ''The Weekly Standard'' (18 October 2004). Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref> For example, while Jonathan Strange is mentioned on the first page of the novel, it is only in a footnote, as the author of a book published years after the beginning of the story. He reappears in other footnotes throughout the opening of the novel, but it is not until a quarter of the way through the novel that he appears in the text proper.<ref name=Feeley/>

In ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'', Clarke writes with dry wit infused with an antiquarian coziness. For example, the narrator notes: "It has been remarked (by a lady infinitely cleverer than the present author) how kindly disposed the world in general feels to young people who either die or marry. Imagine then the interest that surrounded Miss Wintertowne! No young lady ever had such advantages before: for she died upon the Tuesday, was raised to life in the early hours of Wednesday morning, and was married upon the Thursday; which some people thought too much excitement for one week." As Faber explains, "here we have all the defining features of Clarke's style simultaneously: the archly Austenesque tone, the somewhat overdone quaintness ("upon the Tuesday"), the winningly matter-of-fact use of the supernatural, and drollness to spare."<ref name=Faber> Michael Faber, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2004/oct/02/featuresreviews.guardianreview20 "It's a kind of magick"], ''The Guardian'' (2 October 2004). Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref> As Maguire notes, she even gently ridicules the novel itself: "He picks up a book and begins to read...but he is not attending to what he reads and he has got to Page 22 before he discovers it is a novel <U+2013> the sort of work which above all others he most despises <U+2013> and he puts it down in disgust." In another place, the narrator remarks "Dear Emma does not waste her energies upon novels like other young women."<ref name=Maguire/>

Clarke's style extends to the novel<U+2019>s 185 footnotes<ref name=Hendrix>Grady Hendrix, [http://www.villagevoice.com/2004-08-24/books/do-you-believe-in-magic/1 "Do You Believe in Magic?"], ''Village Voice'' (24 August 2004). Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref> which constitute a meticulous false history of English magic and, as one critic noted, "a fastidiously false bibliography".<ref name=Hodgman/> At times, the footnotes overtake the pages of the novel proper altogether. Dirda describes these notes as <U+201C>dazzling feats of imaginative scholarship<U+201D>, in which the narrator<U+2019>s anonymous narrator <U+201C>provides elaborate mini-essays, relating anecdotes from the lives of semi-legendary magicians, describing strange books and their contents, speculating upon the early years and later fate of the Raven King<U+201D>.<ref name=Dirda>Michael Dirda, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57806-2004Sep2.html "Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell"], ''Washington Post'' (5 September 2004).

The [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poet]] [[John Keats|John Keats<U+2019>s]] "vision of  enchantment and devastation following upon any dealings with ''faeries''" informs the novel, as the passing reference to the "cold hillside" makes clear.<ref name=Feeley/> The magic in ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'' has been described as "wintry and sinister"<ref name=Miller/> and "a melancholy, macabre thing".<ref name=Grossman/> There are "flocks of black birds, a forest that grows up in the canals of Venice, a countryside of bleak moors that can only be entered through mirrors, a phantom bell that makes people think of everything they have ever lost, a midnight darkness that follows an accursed man everywhere he goes".<ref name=Miller/> The illustrations take on this tenor. As Nisi Shawl writes, "Shadows fill the illustrations by Portia Rosenberg, as apt as [[Edward Gorey]]'s for Dickens' '[[Bleak House]]'."<ref name=Shawl>Nisi Shawl, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/books/2002032328_strange12.html "'Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell': An enchanting blend of mundane and magical in an alternative 1800s"], ''The Seattle Times'' (12 September 2004).

''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'' has been described as a [[fantasy]] novel, an [[alternate history]], an [[historical fiction]] as well as a combination of these. Clarke herself has said that "I think the novel is viewed as something new...blending together a few genres <U+2013> such as fantasy and adventure and pastiche historical <U+2013> plus there's the whole thing about slightly knowing footnotes commenting on the story."<ref name=FreemanInterview/> She notes in an interview that she was particularly influenced by the historical fiction of [[Rosemary Sutcliff]], the fantasy of [[Ursula LeGuin]] and [[Alan Garner]] and loved the works of Austen.<ref name=Hodgman/>

Freeman comments that, like [[Franz Kafka]] and [[Neil Gaiman]], Clarke<U+2019>s fantasy is imbued with [[Literary realism|realism]]. It is the footnotes in particular, he argues, that lend an air of credibility to the narrative; for example, they describe a fictional biography of Jonathan Strange and notes listing where particular paintings in Norrell<U+2019>s house are located.<ref name=FreemanReview>John Freeman, "Magic to do: Faux footnotes, social observation, and wizard rivalry stir the pot in Susanna Clarke's 19th-century tale", ''The Boston Globe'' (3 October 2004). LexisNexis. Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref> This is, in fact, how Clarke herself describes writing her fantasy: "One way of grounding the magic is by putting in lots of stuff about street lamps, carriages and how difficult it is to get good servants."<ref name=Hodgman/> This realism has led other reviewers, such as Shulman, to argue that Clarke<U+2019>s book is more of an historical fiction, akin to the works of [[Patrick O<U+2019>Brian]]. As she explains, <U+201C>Both Clarke's and O'Brian's stories are about a complicated relationship between two men bound together by their profession; both are set during the Napoleonic wars; and they share a dry, melancholy wit and unconventional narrative shape."<ref name=Shulman/> For Shulman, both fantasy and historical fiction must follow rigid rules or else the narrative will break down.

Like her pastiche of literary styles, Clarke draws on many [[Romanticism|Romantic]] literary genres: the [[comedy of manners]], the [[Gothic fiction|Gothic tale]], the [[Fashionable novel|silver-fork novel]], the military adventure, the [[Byronic hero]], and the historical romance of [[Walter Scott]].<ref name=Dirda/> She joins these together with modern genres, such as the fantasy novel, drawing on the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Philip Pullman]], [[T. H. White]], and [[C.S. Lewis]] There are, as Maguire notes, rings of power and books of spells, that originate in these authors' works.<ref name=Maguire/>

==Themes==
===Friendship===
Reviewers focused most frequently on dynamic between Norrell and Strange, arguing that the novel was about their relationship.<ref name=Hendrix/> The two are a "study in contrasts"<ref name=Grossman/>, with Norrell "exceptionally learned but shy and fussy" while Strange is "charming, young, fashionable and romantic".<ref name=Grossman/> As one reviewer remarked, "Clarke could have called the book ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' if the title weren't already taken."<ref name=Grossman/> Clarke offers doubled characters throughout the novel, even "false doubles", such as the relationship between Jonathan Strange and Jonathan Segundus.<ref name=Feeley/>

===Rationalism===
Clarke<U+2019>s novel is one deeply invested in rationalism. As Shulman argues, "Clarke isn't interested in dark lords and good versus evil per se. For her, the dichotomy is between madness and reason" and the fairy world is connected to madness (mad people can see fairies, for example).<ref name=Shulman>Polly Shulman, [http://slate.msn.com/id/2106798 "Fantasy for Grown-ups"], www.slate.com (16 September 2004). Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref> According to Faber, "Clarke is ultimately an arch-rationalist....supernatural aid is a lethal trap,  the search for mystical enlightenment mimics the degradations of drug addiction, a charmed life is a Kafkaesque nightmare".<ref name=Faber/>

===Englishness===
It is not only the style of Clarke's book that marks it out as distinctively English, but also its themes of "vigorous common sense", "firm ethical fiber", "serene reason and self-confidence", drawn from its [[Augustan literature|Augustan literary]] roots. However, the "muddy, bloody, instinctual spirit of the fairies" is also a part of that Englishness, along with "arrogance, provincialism and class prejudice".<ref name=Miller/>

==Reception==
[[File:Susanna Clarke March 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[Susanna Clarke]] went on a 20-city tour to promote her book in 2004.<ref name=FreemanInterview/>]]
Bloomsbury, the company who published the [[Harry Potter]] series, launched "one of the biggest marketing campaigns in publishing history", according ''[[The Observer]]'',  to promote ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell''.<ref name=DSmith>David Smith, "First time novelist weaves <U+00A3>1m magic: Historical tale billed as Harry Potter for adults set to be a world blockbuster", ''The Observer'' (22 February 2004). LexisNexis. Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref> Their campaign included plans for newspaper serializations, deliveries by horse and carriage, and placing "themed teasers" such as period stationery and mock newspapers in US coffeeshops.<ref name=DSmith/> 7,500 advance readers<U+2019> copies were sent out, a limited number wrapped in paper and sealed with wax. These sold for more than $100 each on [[eBay]] in England in the weeks leading up to publication.<ref name=Hodgman/> By 2005, collectors were paying hundreds of pounds for signed copies of a limited print-run edition of the novel.<ref>David Derbyshire, "Book a fortune in advance &mdash; by buying limited editions". ''Daily Telegraph'' (London) (30 April 2005). LexisNexis. Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref>

When the novel was published on 8 September 2004 in the US, it was already at No. 9 on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller list]], rising to No. 3 two weeks later.<ref name=Dawtrey/> Four weeks after its initial publication, the novel was in [[Amazon.com|amazon.com<U+2019>s]] top ten.<ref name=WGrossman/> After the publication of the novel in over 20 countries almost simultaneously, Clarke went on a 20-city tour to promote the book.<ref name=FreemanInterview>John Freeman, "Author interview: Susanna Clarke", ''St. Petersburg Times'' (Florida) (12 September 2004). LexisNexis. Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref> Endorsements from independent booksellers helped the novel sell out its first printing.<ref name=FreemanInterview/>

While the reviews praised Clarke's "deft" handling of the pastiche of styles, many criticized the pacing of the novel, Faber writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that "the plot creaks frightfully in many places and the pace dawdles".<ref name=Faber/> Dirda, in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', agreed with other reviewers who noted that "sex plays virtually no role in the story...[and] one looks in vain for the corruption of the innocent".<ref name=Dirda/> Craig, in her review for the ''[[New Statesman]]'', praised Clarke by saying "this, in other words, is a tale of magic such as might have been written by the young Jane Austen <U+2013> or, perhaps, by the young Mrs Radcliffe, whose Gothic imagination and exuberant delicacy of style set the key." However, she criticized the novel, writing that, "As fantasy, it is deplorable, given that it fails to embrace the essentially anarchic nature of such tales. What is so wonderful about magicians, wizards and all witches other than Morgan le Fay is not just their magical powers, but that they possess these in spite of being low-born. Far from caring about being gentlemen, wizards are the ultimate expression of rank's irrelevance to talent".<ref name=Craig/> Of course, there was far from universal agreement on any of these points. Maguire wrote in the ''[[New York Times]]'' that "What keeps this densely realized confection aloft is that very quality of reverence to the writers of the past. The chief character in ''Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell'' isn't, in fact, either of the magicians: it's the library that they both adore, the books they consult and write and, in a sense, become. Clarke's giddiness comes from finding a way at once to enter the company of her literary heroes, to pay them homage and to add to the literature, to slot this big fat book into our own libraries of spells."<ref name=Maguire/> 

The novel was named to numerous "best of 2004" lists and ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' named it the best novel of 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/bestandworst/2004/books.html |title=Time 2004 Best and Worst Books |accessdate=2008-02-18 |publisher=[[Time]]}}</ref>

===Audio book===
[[Simon Prebble]] recorded the 32-hour audio book of ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'' for [[Audio Renaissance]], which was released in 2004.<ref name=SJH>S.J.H., "Review of ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell''", ''AudioFile'' (Feb/Mar 2005) (subscription required). Retrieved 6 January 2009.</ref>  According to a review in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', Prebble "navigates this production with much assuredness and an array of accents. He understands that the book is, at its core, a comedy of manners. Prebble's full voice is altered to a delicate softness for young ladies of a certain breeding, or tightened to convey the snarkiness often heard in the costive Norrell."<ref>Rochelle O'Gorman, "Invention and Detection, In Tales Thick and 'Thin'". ''The Boston Globe'' (3 April 2005). LexisNexis. Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref> Prebble interrupts the main text to read the footnote, announcing them with the word ''footnote''.
