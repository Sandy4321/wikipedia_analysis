'''''Rolling Stone''''' is a magazine published every two weeks that focuses on politics and popular culture. In 1967, ''Rolling Stone'' was founded in San Francisco, California, by [[Jann Wenner]] <U+2013> who is still the magazine's chief editor <U+2013> and music critic, [[Ralph J. Gleason]].

''Rolling Stone'' was known for its musical coverage and for political reporting by the enigmatic and controversial [[Gonzo journalism|gonzo]] journalist, [[Hunter S. Thompson]]. In the 1990s, the magazine changed its format to appeal to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. This led to criticism that the magazine was emphasizing style over substance.<ref name="samuelfreedman.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.samuelfreedman.com/articles/culture/ust_rolling.html|title=Literary 'Rolling Stone' sells out to male titillation|last=Freedman|first=Samuel G. |date=Date TK, 2002|publisher=''USA Today''|accessdate=February 12, 2009}}</ref>

In recent years, the magazine has resumed its traditional mix of content, including in-depth political stories. It also has expanded content to include coverage of financial and banking issues. As a result, the magazine has seen its circulation increase and its reporters invited as experts to network television programs of note.<ref>Bill Moyers, [http://billmoyers.com/segment/matt-taibbi-and-yves-smith-on-the-follies-of-big-banks-and-government/ ''Matt Taibbi and Yves Smith on the Follies of Big Banks and Government''], June 22, 2012</ref>

==Beginnings==
To get the magazine off the ground, Wenner borrowed $7,500 from his family
members and from the family of his soon-to-be wife, Michell Palmer.<ref name="Wenner's world">{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/people/bc/1999/04/20/wenner/print.html|title=The evolution of Jann Wenner: How the ultimate '60s rock groupie built his fantasy into a media empire|last=Weir|first=David|coauthors=Salon people.com|date=April 20, 1999|work=Wenner's world|publisher=''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' |accessdate=February 12, 2009}}</ref> The first issue carried a cover date of November 9, 1967<ref>{{Cite episode  | title = Pable Pawncasso  | episodelink = List of Pawn Stars episodes#Season 4  | series = Pawn Stars  | serieslink = Pawn Stars

However, the magazine distanced itself from the underground newspapers of the time, such as ''[[Berkeley Barb]]'', embracing more traditional journalistic standards and avoiding the radical politics of the [[underground press]]. In the very first edition of the magazine, Wenner wrote that ''Rolling Stone'' "is not just about the music, but about the things and attitudes that music embraces."

In the 1970s, ''Rolling Stone'' began to make a mark for its political coverage, with the likes of [[Gonzo journalism|gonzo]] journalist [[Hunter S. Thompson]] writing for the magazine's political section. Thompson would first publish his most famous work ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' within the pages of ''Rolling Stone'', where he remained a contributing editor until his death in 2005. In the 1970s, the magazine also helped launch the careers of many prominent authors, including [[Cameron Crowe]], [[Lester Bangs]], [[Joe Klein (journalist)|Joe Klein]], [[Joe Eszterhas]], [[Patti Smith]] and [[P. J. O'Rourke]]. It was at this point that the magazine ran some of its most famous stories, including that of the [[Patty Hearst]] abduction odyssey. One interviewer, speaking for large numbers of his peers, said that he bought his first copy of the magazine upon initial arrival on his college campus, which he described as a "[[rite of passage]]".<ref name="samuelfreedman.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.samuelfreedman.com/articles/culture/ust_rolling.html|title=Literary 'Rolling Stone' sells out to male titillation|last=Freedman|first=Samuel G. |date=Date TK, 2002|publisher=''USA Today''|accessdate=February 12, 2009}}</ref>

During the 1980s the magazine began to shift focus towards being a general "entertainment" magazine. Music was still a dominant topic but there was increasing coverage of celebrities in television, films and the pop culture of the day. The magazine also initiated its annual "Hot Issue" during this time.

The printed format has gone through several changes. The first publications in 1967<U+2013>72, were folded tabloid newspaper format, no staples with black ink text, and a single color highlight that changed each edition. From 1973 on, editions were done on a four-color press with a different newsprint paper size. In 1979, the bar code appeared. In 1980, it became a gloss paper, large format (10<U+2033><U+00D7>12<U+2033>) magazine. As of October 30, 2008 edition, ''Rolling Stone'' is a smaller, standard-format magazine size. (''[[USA Today]]'',{{Issue|date=April 2011}} [[Associated Press]] Anick Jesdanun)

On November 5, 2012, the magazine published its first cover in the Spanish language as recognition to the influence of Latino artists in American culture.

==Criticism==
One major criticism of ''Rolling Stone'' involves its generational bias toward the 1960s and 1970s. One critic referred to the ''Rolling Stone'' list of the "99 Greatest Songs" as an example of "unrepentant [[rockist]] fogeyism".<ref name="Popism">May 9, 2006. Does hating rock make you a music critic? Jody Rosen. Slate. [http://slate.com/id/2141418/ Article charging "RS" with "fogeyism."]</ref> In further response to this issue, rock critic [[Jim DeRogatis]], a former ''Rolling Stone'' editor, published a thorough critique of the magazine's lists in a book called ''Kill Your Idols: A New Generation of Rock Writers Reconsiders the Classics'' (ISBN 1-56980-276-9), which featured differing opinions from many younger critics.<ref>July 4, 2004.

''Rolling Stone'' magazine has been criticized for reconsidering many classic albums that it had previously dismissed and (in recent years) for frequent abuse of the 3.5 star rating. Examples of artists for whom this is the case include, among others, [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[AC/DC]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Weezer]], [[Radiohead]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Outkast]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}. For example, Led Zeppelin was largely written off by ''Rolling Stone'' magazine critics during the band's most active years in the 1970s. However by 2006, a [[Article (publishing)|cover story]] on [[Led Zeppelin]] honored them as "the Heaviest Band of All Time".<ref name="shout">{{cite web|url=http://www.shoutmouth.com/index.php/news/12829 |title=Documentation of attempt to change reviews |publisher=Shoutmouth.com |date= |accessdate=August 18, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070630190730/http://www.shoutmouth.com/index.php/news/12829 |archivedate=June 30, 2007 }}</ref> A critic for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine described a conference at which 1984's ''[[The Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'' was scrutinized. As he described it, "The guide virtually ignored hip-hop and ruthlessly panned heavy metal, the two genres that within a few years would dominate the pop charts. In an auditorium packed with music journalists, you could detect more than a few anxious titters: How many of us will want our record reviews read back to us 20 years hence?"<ref name="Popism">{{cite web|last=Rosen |first=Jody |url=http://slate.com/id/2141418/ |title=Does hating rock make you a music critic? |publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''&nbsp;<U+2013> Slate.com |date=May 9, 2006 |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref> Another example of this bias was that the album ''Nevermind'', by grunge band Nirvana, was given three stars in its original review, despite being placed at No. 17 in "[[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]" list in 2003. Also, when The Beatles' ''[[Let It Be]]'' was released in 1970, the magazine originally gave the album a poor review, yet in 2003, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked it number 86 in the magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6598123/86_let_it_be |title=Search Articles, Artists, Reviews, Videos, Music and Movies |publisher=''Rolling Stone'' |date= |accessdate=October 15, 2010}}</ref>

The hiring of former ''[[FHM]]'' editor Ed Needham further enraged critics who alleged that ''Rolling Stone'' had lost its credibility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://salon.com/ent/feature/2002/06/28/rollingstone/index.html |title=The death of Rolling Stone |publisher=Salon.com |date=June 28, 2002 |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref>

The 2003 ''Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Guitarists of all Time'' article's inclusion of only two female musicians resulted in ''[[Venus Zine]]'' answering with their own list entitled, "The Greatest Female Guitarists of All Time".<ref name="The Greatest Female Guitarists of All Time">{{cite web|last=Thurston |first=Bonnie |url=http://www.venuszine.com/articles/music/2575/The_Greatest_Female_Guitarists_of_All_Time |title=The Greatest Female Guitarists of All Time |publisher=Venus Zine |date= |accessdate=October 15, 2010}}</ref>

The August 2013 ''Rolling Stone'' cover featuring alleged [[Boston Marathon bombings|Boston Marathon]] bomber [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev]] drew widespread criticism that the magazine was "glamorizing terrorism" and that the cover was a "slap in the face to the great city of Boston."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57594141/rolling-stone-cover-featuring-boston-marathon-bombing-suspect-stirs-online-backlash/|title = Rolling Stone cover featuring Boston Marathon bombing suspect stirs online backlash|date = July 17, 2013|publisher = CBS.com}}</ref> The online edition of the article was accompanied by a short editorial which stated that the story "falls within the traditions of journalism and Rolling Stone's long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day."<ref name=reitman>{{cite web|last=Reitman|first=Janet|title=Jahar's World|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/jahars-world-20130717|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=July 24, 2013|date=July 17, 2013}}</ref> The controversial cover photograph which was used by ''Rolling Stone'' had previously featured on the front page of the ''[[New York Times]]'' on May 5, 2013.<ref name=wemple>{{cite web|last=Wemple|first=Erik|title=Rolling Stone's Tsarnaev: Did the New York Times face a backlash?|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/07/17/rolling-stones-tsarnaev-did-the-new-york-times-face-a-backlash/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=July 24, 2013}}</ref>

After years of declining readership, the magazine experienced a major resurgence of interest and relevance with the work of two young journalists in the late 2000s: [[Michael Hastings (journalist)|Michael Hastings]] and [[Matt Taibbi]].

In 2009, Taibbi unleashed a scathing series of acclaimed reporting on the financial meltdown. He famously dubbed Goldman Sachs "The Great Vampire Squid."

Bigger headlines came at the end of June 2010. ''Rolling Stone'' caused a controversy in the [[White House]] by publishing in the July issue an article by journalist [[Michael Hastings (journalist)|Michael Hastings]], entitled, "The Runaway General",<ref>{{cite web|author=By&nbsp;Michael Hastings |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/17390/119236 |title=The Runaway General <U+2013> Stanley McChrystal, Obama's top commander in Afghanistan, has seized control of the war by never taking his eye off the real enemy: The wimps in the White House |publisher=Rollingstone.com |date=June 22, 2010 |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref> quoting criticism of General [[Stanley A.

In 2010, Taibbi documented illegal and fraudulent actions by banks in the foreclosure courts after traveling to Jacksonville, Florida and sitting in on hearings in the courtroom. His article, ''Invasion of the Home Snatchers'' also documented attempts by the judge to intimidate a homeowner fighting foreclosure and the attorney Taibbi accompanied into the court.<ref>Taibbi, Matt, [http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/matt-taibbi-courts-helping-banks-screw-over-homeowners-20101110/ ''Invasion of the Home Snatchers''], ''Rolling Stone'', November 10, 2010</ref><ref>Charney, April, "that day... a stain on Jacksonville" statement, December 14, 2011 ''Occupy Jax advised by foreclosure attorney'', 10:30<U+2013>11:00, YouTube video uploaded December 15, 2011 [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYtbCfIrR3U]</ref>

In January 2012, the magazine ran exclusive excerpts from Hastings' book just prior to publication. The book, ''The Operators: The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America<U+2019>s War in Afghanistan,'' provided a much more expansive look at McChrystal and the culture of senior American military and how they get embroiled in these wars. It has been described as a boozy, sexy account of the misadventures of America's most notorious killers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The book reached Amazon's bestseller list in the first 48 hours of release, and it received generally favorable reviews. Salon's Glenn Greenwald described it as "superb," "brave" and "eye-opening."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/statement-president-rose-garden |title=Michael Hastings on war journalists |publisher=Salon.com |date=January 6, 2012 |accessdate=January 9, 2012}}</ref>

In 2012, financial scandals also continued to rock the world. Taibbi emerged as an expert who could explain the events as they unfolded. His articles garnered him invitations to nationally broadcast television programs.<ref>[http://billmoyers.com/segment/matt-taibbi-and-yves-smith-on-the-follies-of-big-banks-and-government/ June 22, 2012 Bill Moyers Show]</ref><ref>[http://www.capitalismwithoutfailure.com/2012/07/matt-taibbi-eliott-spitzer-and-dennis.html/ July 4, 2012 Viewpoint with Elliot Sputzer]</ref> In a July discussion of the [[Libor]] revelations, Taibbi's coverage<ref>Taibbi, Matt, [http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/taibblog/why-is-nobody-freaking-out-about-the-libor-banking-scandal-20120703#ixzz1zcu88hJ9/ Why is Nobody Freaking Out About the LIBOR Scandal?], ''Rolling Stone'', July 3, 2012</ref> was singled out by Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, Inc., as becoming required reading to remain informed.

==Website==

''Rolling Stone'' has maintained a website for many years, with selected current articles, reviews, blogs, MP3s, and other features such as searchable and free encyclopedic articles about artists, with images and sometimes sound clips of their work. The articles and reviews are sometimes in a revised form from the versions that are published.  There are also selected archival political and cultural articles and entries. The site also at one time had an extensive message board forum. By the late 1990s, the message board forum at the site had developed into a thriving community with a large number of regular members and contributors worldwide. The site was also plagued with numerous [[Troll (Internet)|Internet trolls]] and malicious code-hackers who vandalized the forum substantially.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rsjunior.proboards18.com/index.cgi?board=tribunal&action=display&thread=1085021884&page=19 |title=RS.com Castaways <U+2013> Troll Tribunal |publisher=Rsjunior.proboards18.com |date= |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' abruptly deleted the forum in May 2004. ''Rolling Stone'' began a new, much more limited message board community at their site in late 2005, only to remove it again in 2006. ''Rolling Stone'' also has a page at MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter. In March 2008, the ''Rolling Stone'' website started a new message board section once again, then deleted it in April 2010. The magazine devotes one of its Table of Contents pages to promoting material currently appearing at its website, listing detailed links to the items.

==In popular culture==
* "[[The Cover of the Rolling Stone]]" is a 1973 song satirizing success in the music business. It was first recorded by [[Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show]], who subsequently did get on the cover of the magazine, albeit in caricature rather than a photograph.
* [[George Harrison]]'s 1975 song "[[This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)|This Guitar]]", a lyrical sequel to his [[Beatles]] track "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]", references the magazine in its second verse: "''Learned to get up when I fall / Can even climb'' Rolling Stone ''walls''". The song was written in response to some unduly harsh reviews from ''Rolling Stone'' and other publications for Harrison's 1974 North American tour and the ''[[Dark Horse (George Harrison album)|Dark Horse]]'' album.<ref>Simon Leng, ''While My Guitar Gently Weeps: The Music of George Harrison'', Hal Leonard (Milwaukee, WI, 2006), pp 181<U+2013>82,</ref><ref>Alan Clayson, ''George Harrison'', Sanctuary (London, 2003), p. 350.</ref>
* In [[Stephen King]]'s 1980 novel ''[[Firestarter (novel)|Firestarter]]'', the protagonist chooses ''Rolling Stone'' as an unbiased independent media source, through which she can expose the government agency hunting her.  However, in the [[Firestarter (film)|film adaptation]], the protagonist chooses ''[[The New York Times]]''.
* 1985 film'' [[Perfect (film)|Perfect]]'' depicts [[John Travolta]] as a reporter for ''Rolling Stone'', covering the health club fad of the time. Jann Wenner plays editor-in-chief "Mark Roth".
* 2000 film ''[[Almost Famous]]'' portrayed fictional 15-year-old aspiring rock journalist writing for ''Rolling Stone''. The semi-autobiographical film was written and directed by former ''Rolling Stone'' columnist [[Cameron Crowe]] and featured portrayals of publisher [[Jann Wenner]] ([[Eion Bailey]]), editor [[Ben Fong-Torres]] ([[Terry Chen]]), David Felton ([[Rainn Wilson]]) and others in ''Rolling Stone'''s 1970s San Francisco offices. Wenner also had a cameo in the film as a man reading a newspaper in a taxi.
*2002 song, "[[Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous (song)|Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous]]" by pop punk band [[Good Charlotte]] refer to the excesses of modern celebrities and the influence of the magazine, in the first verse: "''All they do is piss and moan / Inside the Rolling Stone / Talking about how hard life can be''"
