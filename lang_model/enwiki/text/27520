The '''Principality of Liechtenstein''' {{Audio-IPA|en-us-Liechtenstein.ogg|/<U+02C8>l<U+026A>kt<U+0259>nsta<U+026A>n/}} ({{lang-de|F<U+00FC>rstentum Liechtenstein}}, {{Audio-IPA|correct-German-pronunciation-of-Fuerstentum-Liechtenstein.ogg|<U+02C8>f<U+028F><U+0281>st<U+0259>ntu<U+02D0>m <U+02C8>li<U+02D0><U+00E7>t<U+0259>n<U+0283>ta<U+026A>n}}, ''Principality of Liechtenstein'') is a [[Landlocked#Doubly_landlocked_country|doubly landlocked]] [[alpine country|alpine]] [[microstate]] in [[Western Europe]], bordered by [[Switzerland]] to the west and south and by [[Austria]] to the east. Its area is just over 160&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (about 61.7 square miles) and it has an estimated population of 35,000. Its capital is [[Vaduz]], the biggest town is [[Schaan]].

Liechtenstein is the smallest [[German language|German]]-speaking country in the world, and the only alpine country to lie entirely within the Alps. It is also the only German-speaking country not to share a common frontier with Germany. It is a [[constitutional monarchy]] divided into [[Municipalities of Liechtenstein|11 municipalities]]. Much of Liechtenstein's terrain is mountainous, making it a [[winter sport]]s destination. Many cultivated fields and small farms characterize its landscape both in the north (Unterland, ''lower land'') and in the south (Oberland, ''upper land''). The country has a strong financial sector located in the capital, Vaduz, and has been identified as a [[tax haven]]. It is a member of the [[European Free Trade Association]]. Liechtenstein is not part of the [[European Union]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Liechtenstein}}

At one time, the territory was part of the ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Raetia]]. For centuries this territory, geographically removed from European strategic interests, had little impact on European history. Prior to the reign of its current [[dynasty]], the region was [[Enfeoffment|enfeoffed]] to a line of the counts of [[Hohenems]]. 

The [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein dynasty]], from which the principality takes its name, comes from [[Castle Liechtenstein]] in Lower Austria, which the family possessed from at least 1140 until the 13th century, and from 1807 onward. Through the centuries, the dynasty acquired vast tracts of land, predominantly in [[Moravia]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Silesia]], and [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], though these territories were all held in [[Fiefdom|fief]] under other more senior feudal lords, particularly under various lines of the [[Habsburg]] family, whom several Liechtenstein princes served as close advisers. Thus, without any territory held directly under the Imperial throne, the Liechtenstein dynasty was unable to meet a primary requirement to qualify for a seat in the Imperial diet, the [[Reichstag (institution)|''Reichstag'']].

The family yearned for the added power a seat in the Imperial government would bring, and therefore sought to acquire lands that would be ''unmittelbar'', or held without any feudal personage other than the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] himself having rights on the land. After some time, the family was able to arrange the purchase of the minuscule ''Herrschaft'' ("Lordship") of [[Schellenberg]] and county of [[Vaduz]] (in 1699 and 1712 respectively) from the Hohenems. Tiny Schellenberg and Vaduz had exactly the political status required: no feudal lord other than their [[count|comital]] sovereign and the [[Suzerainty|suzerain]] Emperor.

On January 23, 1719, after the lands had been purchased, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], decreed that Vaduz and Schellenberg were united, and elevated the newly-formed territory to the dignity of ''F<U+00FC>rstentum'' (''[[principality]]'') with the name "Liechtenstein" in honour of "[his] true servant, [[Anton Florian of Liechtenstein]]". It was on this date that Liechtenstein became a sovereign member state of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It is a testament to the pure political expediency of the purchases that the Princes of Liechtenstein did not set foot in their new principality for over 120 years.
[[Image:Schlossvaduz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Schloss Vaduz]], overlooking the capital, is still home to the [[Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince of Liechtenstein]]]]

As a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], by 1806 the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was under the control of French emperor [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]]. Napoleon dissolved the Empire and this had broad consequences for Liechtenstein: imperial, legal and political mechanisms broke down. The state ceased to owe obligations to any feudal lord beyond its borders. Modern publications generally (although incorrectly) attribute Liechtenstein's ''sovereignty'' to these events. In reality, its prince merely became [[suzerainty|suzerain]], as well as remaining sovereign lord. From 25 July 1806 when the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] was founded, the Prince of Liechtenstein was a member, in fact a vassal of its hegemon, styled ''protector'', French Emperor Napoleon I, until the dissolution of the Confederation on 19 October 1813.

Soon afterward, Liechtenstein joined the [[German Confederation]] (20 June 1815{{ndash}} 24 August 1866) which was presided over by the [[Emperor of Austria]].

[[Image:Johann I v Liechtenstein.jpg|thumb|left|[[Johann I Josef, Prince of Liechtenstein]]]]
Then, in 1818, [[Johann I Josef, Prince of Liechtenstein|Johann I]] granted the territory a limited constitution. 1818 also saw the first visit of a member of the house of Liechtenstein, Prince Alois; however, the first visit by a sovereign prince would not occur until 1842.

Developments during the 19th century included:
*In 1836, the first factory was opened, making ceramics. 
*In 1861, the Savings and Loans Bank was founded, as was the first cotton-weaving mill.
*Two bridges over the Rhine were built in 1868, and in 1872 a railway line across Liechtenstein was constructed.

Until the end of [[World War I]], Liechtenstein was closely tied first to the [[Austrian Empire]] and later to [[Austria-Hungary]]; the ruling princes continued to derive much of their wealth from estates in the Habsburg territories, and they spent much of their time at their two palaces in Vienna. The economic devastation caused by this war forced the country to conclude a customs and monetary union with its other neighbour, [[Switzerland]]. Liechtenstein's army was disbanded in 1868 for financial reasons. At the time of the dissolution of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], it was argued that Liechtenstein, as a fief of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], was no longer bound to the emerging independent state of [[Austria]], since the latter did not consider itself as the legal successor to the Empire. This is partly contradicted by the [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/coeval coeval] Liechtenstein perception that the dethroned Austro-Hungarian Emperor still maintained an abstract heritage of the Holy Roman Empire.

[[Image:Franz I von Liechtenstein.jpg|thumb|[[Franz I, Prince of Liechtenstein]].]]

In the spring of 1938, just after the annexation of Austria into Greater Nazi Germany, 84 year old [[Franz I of Liechtenstein|Prince Franz I]] abdicated, naming his 31 year old third cousin, [[Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince Franz Joseph]], as his successor. While Prince Franz I claimed that old age was his reason for abdicating, it is believed{{Who|date=August 2009}} that he had no desire to be on the throne if Germany were to gobble up Liechtenstein. His wife, whom he had married in 1929, was a wealthy Jewish woman from Vienna, and local Liechtenstein Nazis had already identified her as their Jewish "problem". Although Liechtenstein had no official Nazi party, a Nazi sympathy movement had been simmering for years within its National Union party.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,759431,00.html Nazi Pressure? - TIME], 11 April 1938.</ref>

During [[World War II]], Liechtenstein remained officially neutral, looking to neighboring Switzerland for assistance and guidance, while family treasures within the war zone were taken to Liechtenstein (and [[London]]) for safekeeping. At the close of the conflict, [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Poland]], acting to seize what they considered to be German possessions, expropriated the entirety of the Liechtenstein dynasty's hereditary lands and possessions in [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], and [[Silesia]] <U+2014> the princes of Liechtenstein lived in [[Vienna]] until the [[Anschluss]] of 1938. The expropriations (subject to modern legal dispute at the [[World Court]]) included over {{convert|1600|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of agricultural and forest land, and several family castles and palaces. Citizens of Liechtenstein were also forbidden to enter Czechoslovakia during the [[Cold War]]. More recently the diplomatic conflict revolving around the controversial post-war [[Bene<U+0161> decrees]] has resulted in Liechtenstein not sharing international relations with the Czech Republic or Slovakia. The issue with Slovakia is yet to be resolved, however, Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic established diplomatic relations on 13 July 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic establish diplomatic relations|url=http://88.82.102.51/fileadmin/_pm.liechtenstein.li/en/090713_PM_Beziehungen_CzFl_en.pdf|format=pdf|publisher=Government Spokesperson<U+2019>s Office, the Principality of Liechtenstein|date=2009-07-13|accessdate=2009-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nav<U+00E1>z<U+00E1>n<U+00ED> diplomatick<U+00FD>ch styk<U+016F> <U+010C>esk<U+00E9> republiky s Kn<U+00ED><U+017E>ectv<U+00ED>m Lichten<U+0161>tejnsko|url=http://www.mzv.cz/jnp/cz/udalosti_a_media/prohlaseni_a_stanoviska/x2009_07_13_lilchtejnstejnsko_navazani_diplomatickych_vztahu.html|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic|language=Czech|date=2009-07-13|accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref><ref>http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/7526/1/</ref>. Liechtenstein gave asylum to about 500 soldiers of the [[First Russian National Army]] (a collaborationist Russian force within the German [[Wehrmacht]]) at the close of World War II; this is commemorated by a [[Russian Monument Liechtenstein|monument]] at the border town of [[Hinterschellenberg]] which is marked on the country's [[tourist]] map. The act of granting asylum was no small matter as the country was poor and had difficulty feeding and caring for such a large group of refugees. Eventually, Argentina agreed to resettle the asylum seekers permanently. In contrast, [[Operation Keelhaul|the British repatriated the Russians]] who had fought for Germany to the USSR, and many of them perished in the [[Gulag]].

In dire financial straits following the war, the Liechtenstein dynasty often resorted to selling family artistic treasures, including the priceless portrait "[[Ginevra de' Benci]]" by Leonardo da Vinci, which was purchased by the [[National Gallery of Art]] of the [[United States]] in 1967. Liechtenstein prospered, however, during the decades following, as it used its low corporate tax rates to draw many companies to the country.

The [[Prince of Liechtenstein]] is the world's sixth wealthiest leader with an estimated wealth of [[United States dollar|USD]] $5 billion.<ref>D. Pendleton, C. Vorasasun, C. von Zeppelin, T.

==Government functions==
[[Image:Regierungsgeb<U+00E4>ude Vaduz, Liechtenstein.jpg|thumb|The Government building in Vaduz.]]
{{Main|Politics of Liechtenstein}}

Liechtenstein's current constitution was adopted in March 2003, replacing the previous 1921 constitution which had established Liechtenstein as a constitutional monarchy headed by the reigning prince of the Princely House of Liechtenstein. A parliamentary system had been established, although the reigning prince retained substantial political authority.

The reigning prince is the head of state and represents Liechtenstein in its international relations (although Switzerland has taken responsibility for much of Liechtenstein's diplomatic relations). The prince may veto laws adopted by parliament. The prince can call [[referendums]], propose new legislation, and dissolve parliament, although dissolution of parliament may be subject to a referendum.

Executive authority is vested in a collegiate government comprising the head of government (prime minister) and four government councilors (ministers). The head of government and the other ministers are appointed by the prince upon the proposal and concurrence of parliament, thus reflecting the partisan balance of parliament. The constitution stipulates that at least two members of the government be chosen from each of the two regions. The members of the government are collectively and individually responsible to parliament; parliament may ask the prince to remove an individual minister or the entire government.

Legislative authority is vested in the unicameral "Landtag" ([[parliament|Liechtenstein Parliament]]) made up of 25 members elected for maximum four-year terms according to a proportional representation formula. Fifteen members are elected from the "Oberland" (Upper Country or region) and ten members are elected from the "Unterland" (Lower Country or region). Parties must receive at least 8% of the national vote to win seats in parliament. Parliament proposes and approves a government, which is formally appointed by the prince. Parliament may also pass votes of no confidence in the entire government or individual members. Additionally, parliament elects from among its members a "Landesausschuss" (National Committee) made up of the president of the parliament and four additional members. The National Committee is charged with performing parliamentary oversight functions. Parliament can call for referendums on proposed legislation. Parliament shares the authority to propose new legislation with the prince and with the requisite number of citizens required for an initiative referendum.

Judicial authority is vested in the Regional Court at Vaduz, the Princely High Court of Appeal at Vaduz, the Princely Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the State Court. The State Court rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution. The State Court has five members elected by parliament.

===New constitution===
In a national referendum in March 2003, nearly two-thirds of the electorate voted in support of Hans-Adam II's proposed new constitution to replace the 1921 one. The proposed constitution was criticised by many, including the [[Council of Europe]], as expanding the powers of the monarchy (continuing the power to veto any law, and allowing the Prince to dismiss the Government or any Minister), and the criticisms were accentuated by a threat by the ruling prince that if the constitution failed, he would, among other things, convert some of the royal property for commercial use. However the royal family and the prince enjoy tremendous public support inside the nation and passing the resolution{{Clarify|date=August 2009}} resulted in a landslide or majority electorate voting in favour.

===Honorary Consuls===
On 1 July 2007, the Liechtenstein Ruling Prince, [[Serene Highness|H.S.H.]] [[Hans-Adam II]], and Liechtenstein's Prime Minister, [[Otmar Hasler]], appointed Dr. [[Bruce S. Allen]] and [[Leodis C. Matthews]], both in the [[United States of America]], as the first two [[Honorary Consul]]s in history for the [[Principality of Liechtenstein]]. The U.S. does not maintain an embassy in Liechtenstein, and it is Switzerland's role to conduct and continue good relations between Switzerland, the U.S and the tiny principality.<ref>[http://www.liechtenstein.li/en/fl-aussenstelle-washington/fl-aussenstelle-aktuell?newsid=15219 Portal of the Principality of Liechtenstein - News & Statements]</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Liechtenstein}}
[[Image:Lichtenstein NASA.png|thumb|Satellite image faintly delineating Liechtenstein - enlarge to full page for clarity.]]
[[Image:Grauspitzen.JPG|thumb|left|[[Grauspitz]], the highest peak in Liechtenstein.]]

Liechtenstein is situated in the Upper [[Rhine]] valley of the European [[Alps]] and is bordered to the east by Austria and to the west by Switzerland. The entire western border of Liechtenstein is formed by the river Rhine. Measured north to south, the country is only about {{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} long. In the east, Liechtenstein rises to higher altitudes: its highest point, the [[Grauspitz]], is {{convert|2599|m|0|abbr=on}}. Despite its Alpine location, prevailing southerly winds make the climate of Liechtenstein comparatively mild. In winter, the mountain slopes are well suited to winter sports.

New [[surveying|surveys]] using more accurate measurements of the country's borders in 2006 have set its area at {{convert|160|km2|3|abbr=on}}, with borders of {{convert|77.9|km|1|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16381664/ "Tiny Liechtenstein gets a little bigger"], 29 December 2006.</ref> Thus, Liechtenstein discovered in 2006 that its borders are {{convert|1.9|km|1|abbr=on}} longer than previously thought.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6215825.stm Liechtenstein redraws Europe map], [[BBC News]], 28 December 2006.</ref>

Liechtenstein is one of only two [[landlocked country#Doubly landlocked_country|doubly landlocked countries]] in the world<ref name="LiechCIA">[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ls.html CIA World Factbook - Liechtenstein].</ref><U+2014>being a landlocked country wholly surrounded by other landlocked countries (the other is [[Uzbekistan]]). Liechtenstein is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|sixth-smallest]] independent nation in the world by land area.

The principality of Liechtenstein is [[Municipalities of Liechtenstein|divided into 11 communes]] called ''Gemeinden'' (singular ''Gemeinde''). The Gemeinden mostly consist only of a single town or village. Five of them ([[Eschen]], [[Gamprin]], [[Mauren]], [[Ruggell]], and [[Schellenberg]]) fall within the electoral district ''Unterland'' (the lower county), and the remainder ([[Balzers]], [[Planken]], [[Schaan]], [[Triesen]], [[Triesenberg]], and [[Vaduz]]) within ''Oberland'' (the upper county).

{{Main|Economy of Liechtenstein}}

Despite or perhaps because of its limited natural resources, Liechtenstein is one of the few countries in the world with more registered companies than citizens; it has developed a prosperous, highly industrialized, free-enterprise economy, and boasts a financial service sector as well as a living standard which compares favourably with those of the urban areas of Liechtenstein's large European neighbours. Relatively low business taxes<U+2014>the maximum tax rate is 20%<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ls.html</ref><U+2014>as well as easy [[Rules of Incorporation]] have induced about 73,700 holding (or so-called 'letter box') companies to establish registered offices in Liechtenstein. This provides about 30% of Liechtenstein's state revenue. Liechtenstein also generates revenue from ''Stiftungen'' ("foundations"), which are financial entities created to increase the privacy of nonresident foreigners' financial holdings. The foundation is registered in the name of a Liechtensteiner, often a lawyer.

Recently, Liechtenstein has shown strong determination to prosecute international money-launderers, and worked to promote the country's image as a legitimate finance center. In February 2008, the country's [[LGT Bank]] was implicated in a [[2008 Liechtenstein tax affair|tax-fraud scandal in Germany]], which strained the ruling family's relationship with the German government. Crown Prince Alois has accused the German government of trafficking in stolen goods. This refers to its $7.3 million purchase of private banking information illegally offered by a former employee of LGT Group.<ref>Wiesmann, Gerrit. "[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4e54e4c4-e1b2-11dc-a302-0000779fd2ac.html Lilliput's giant-slayer]." ''[[The Financial Times]]'', 23 February 2008.</ref><ref>[http://freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2008/02/parasites-priorities.html A Parasite's Priorities], 22 February 2008.</ref> However, the US Senate's subcommittee on tax haven banks said that the LGT bank, which is owned by the royal family, and on whose board they serve, "is a willing partner, and an aider and abettor to clients trying to evade taxes, dodge creditors or defy court orders."<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2008/s2383439.htm</ref>

Liechtenstein participates in a [[customs union]] with [[Switzerland]] and employs the [[Swiss franc]] as national currency. The country imports more than 90% of its energy requirements. Liechtenstein has been a member of the [[European Economic Area]] (an organization serving as a bridge between the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) and the [[European Union]]) since May 1995. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. Since 2002, Liechtenstein's rate of unemployment has doubled, although it stood at only 2.2% in the third quarter of 2004. Currently, there is only one hospital in Liechtenstein, the Liechtensteinisches Landesspital in [[Vaduz]]. The [[GDP]] ([[PPP]]) is $4.16 billion,<ref name="LiechCIA"/> or $118,000 per person. 

Liechtenstein is a large producer of ceramics, and is the world's largest producer of sausage casings and false teeth. Other industries include electronics, textiles, precision instruments, metal manufacturing, power tools, anchors, calculators, pharmaceuticals, and food products. Liechtenstein also produces wheat, barley, corn, potatoes, dairy products, livestock, and wine. Tourism also accounts for a large portion of the country's economy.

Liechtenstein's most recognizable international company and largest employer is [[Hilti]], a manufacturer of [[nailgun|direct fastening systems]] and other high-end [[power tools]]. Liechtenstein is also the home of the [[Curta]] calculator and the principality produces a large portion of the world's false teeth. (Ivoclar Vivadent, [[Schaan]])

==Taxation==
The government of Liechtenstein taxes both personal and business income and principal (wealth). The basic rate of personal income tax is 1.2%. When combined with the additional income tax imposed by the communes, the combined income tax rate is 17.82%.<ref>[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Liechtenstein-TAXATION.html Encyclopedia of the Nations]</ref> An additional income tax of 4.3% is levied on all employees under the country's [[social security]] program. This rate is higher for the self-employed, up to a maximum of 11%, making the maximum income tax rate about 29% in total. Tax on income from employment is collected through monthly withholdings by the employer.

The maximum business income tax rate is 18-20%.<ref name=LiechCIA/>

The basic tax rate on wealth is 0.06% per annum and the combined total rate is 0.89%.

Liechtenstein's gifts and estate taxes vary depending on the relationship the recipient has to the giver and the amount of the inheritance. The tax ranges between 0.5% and 0.75% for spouses and children and 18% to 27% for non-related recipients. The estate tax is progressive (see table opposite).

The rate above is halved if the estate passes to the spouse, children, or parents.<ref>[http://www.lowtax.net/lowtax/html/jlipetx.html Liechtenstein Personal Taxation]</ref>

The [[2008 Liechtenstein tax affair]] is a series of tax investigations in numerous countries whose governments suspect that some of their citizens may have evaded tax obligations by using banks and trusts in Liechtenstein; the affair broke open with the biggest complex of investigations ever initiated for [[tax evasion]] in the [[Federal Republic of Germany]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Skandal gigantischen Ausma<U+00DF>es|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/,tt2m2/wirtschaft/artikel/599/158176/|work=[[S<U+00FC>ddeutsche Zeitung]]|language=German|date=2008-02-15|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> It was also seen as an attempt to put pressure on Liechtenstein, then one of the remaining [[FATF Blacklist|uncooperative tax havens]]{{ndash}} along with [[Andorra]] and [[Monaco]]{{ndash}} as identified by the Paris-based [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] in 2007.<ref name="wsj0219">{{cite news|last=Esterl|first=Mike|coauthors=Simpson, Glenn R., Crawford, David

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Liechtenstein}}

Liechtenstein is the fourth smallest country of Europe, after the [[Vatican City]], [[Monaco]], and [[San Marino]]. Its population is primarily [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]]-speaking [[ethnic Germans]], although its resident population is approximately one third foreign-born, primarily [[German language|German]] speakers from [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]], other [[Switzerland|Swiss]], [[Italians]], and [[Turkish people|Turks]]. Foreign-born people make up two-thirds of the country's workforce. Nationals are referred to by the plural: Liechtensteiners.

The official language is [[German language|German]]; most speak [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]], a [[dialect]] of German that is highly divergent from [[Standard German]] (see [[Middle High German]]), but closely related to those dialects spoken in neighbouring regions such as Vorarlberg, Austria. In [[Triesenberg]], a dialect promoted by the municipality is spoken. According to the 2000 census, 87.9% of the population is [[Christian]], of whom 76% adhere to the [[Roman Catholic]] faith, while about 7% are [[Protestant]]. The religious affiliation of most of the remainder is [[Islam]] 4.8%, undeclared 4.1% and [[no religion]] 2.8%;<ref>[http://www.llv.li/llv-avw-statistik-volkszaehlung-auswertungen Publikationen zur Volksz<U+00E4>hlung 2000 - Amt f<U+00FC>r Volkswirtschaft - Landesverwaltung Liechtenstein]</ref> around 30 [[Jew]]s live in Liechtenstein today.

Liechtensteiners have an average life expectancy at birth of 79.68 years (76.1 years for males; 83.28 years for females). The infant mortality rate is 4.64 deaths per 1,000 live births, according to recent estimates. The literacy rate of Liechtenstein is 100%.<ref name="LiechCIA"/> The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], coordinated by the [[OECD]], currently ranks Liechtenstein's education as the 10th best in the world, being significantly higher than the OECD average.<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf Range of rank on the PISA 2006 science scale]</ref>

==Transport==
[[Image:Ls-map.png|200px|Map of the Principality of Liechtenstein]]
=== Road ===
There are about {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} of paved roadway within Liechtenstein.

=== Rail ===
{{See also|Rail transport in Liechtenstein}}
{{convert|9.5|km|1|abbr=on}} of railway connects Austria and Switzerland through Liechtenstein. The country's railways are administered by the [[<U+00D6>BB|Austrian Federal Railways]] as part of the route between [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]], [[Austria]], and [[Buchs, St. Gallen|Buchs]], [[Switzerland]]. Liechtenstein is nominally within the Austrian Verkehrsverbund Vorarlberg <ref>[http://www.vmobil.at Verkehrsverbund Vorarlberg]</ref> tariff region. 

There are four stations in Liechtenstein, namely Schaan-Vaduz, Forst Hilti, Nendeln, and Schaanwald, served by an irregularly-stopping train service that runs between Feldkirch and Buchs provided by the Austrian Federal Rail Service. While [[EuroCity]] and other long distance international trains also travel along the route, they do not normally stop at the stations within the borders of Liechtenstein.

=== Bus ===
[[Liechtenstein Bus]] is a subsidiary of the [[Postauto|Swiss Postbus system]], but separately run, and connects to the Swiss bus network at [[Buchs, St. Gallen|Buchs]] and at [[Sargans]]. Buses also run to the Austrian town of Feldkirch.

=== Bicycle ===
There are {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=on}} of marked bicycle paths in the country.

=== Air ===
Liechtenstein has no airport; the nearest large airport is [[Z<U+00FC>rich Airport|Z<U+00FC>rich]]. There is a small [[heliport]] at [[Balzers]] in Liechtenstein<ref>[http://www.tsis.ch/heli/heliport/balzers.php Heliport Balzers FL LSXB]</ref><ref>[http://www.heli.li/sites/heliports-balzers-lsxb.php Heliports - Balzers LSXB - Heli-Website von Matthias Vogt]</ref> available for charter helicopter flights.

==Culture==
[[Image:Schlossvaduzvineyards.jpg|thumb|upright|Vineyard on the outskirts of [[Vaduz]].]]
As a result of its small size, Liechtenstein has been strongly affected by external cultural influences, most notably those originating in the southern German-speaking areas of Europe, including [[Austria]], [[Bavaria]], [[Switzerland]], and specifically [[German Tyrol|Tirol]] and Vorarlberg. The ''Historical Society of the Principality of Liechtenstein'' plays a role in preserving the culture and history of the country.

The largest museum is the [[Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein]], an international museum of modern and contemporary art with an important international art collection. The building by the Swiss architects Morger, Degelo and Kerez is a landmark in Vaduz. It was completed in November 2000 and forms a "black box" of tinted concrete and black basalt stone. The museum collection is also the national art collection of Liechtenstein.

The other important museum is the ''Liechtenstein National Museum'' (Liechtensteinisches Landesmuseum) showing permanent exhibition on the cultural and natural history of Liechtenstein as well as special exhibitions. There are also two more museums: a Stamp museum and a Ski museum.

The most famous historical sites are Vaduz Castle, Gutenberg Castle, the Red House and the ruins of Schellenberg.

Music and theatre are an important part of the culture. There are numerous music organizations such as the Liechtenstein Musical Company, the annual Guitar Days and the International Josef Gabriel Rheinberger Society; and two main theatres.

The Private Art Collection of the Prince of Liechtenstein, one of the world's leading private art collections, is shown at the [[Liechtenstein Museum]] in Vienna.

==Sports==
[[Image:Marco B<U+00FC>chel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marco B<U+00FC>chel]], skier.]]
Liechtenstein [[Association football|football]] teams play in the Swiss football leagues. The Liechtenstein Cup allows access for one Liechtenstein team each year to the [[UEFA Europa League]]; [[FC Vaduz]], a team playing in the Swiss [[Axpo Super League]], the first division in Swiss football, is the most successful team in the Cup, and scored their greatest success in the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1996 when they tied and defeated the [[Latvia]]n team [[FC Universitate Riga]] by 1<U+2013>1 and 4<U+2013>2, to go on to a lucrative fixture against [[Paris St Germain]], which they lost 0<U+2013>4 and 0<U+2013>3.

The [[Liechtenstein national football team]] is regarded as an easy target for any team drawn against them; this was the basis for a book about Liechtenstein's unsuccessful qualifying campaign for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] by British author, [[Charlie Connelly]]. In one surprising week during autumn 2004, however, the team managed a 2<U+2013>2 draw with [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], who only a few months earlier had been the losing finalists in the [[2004 European Football Championship|European Championships]]. Four days later, the Liechtenstein team traveled to Luxembourg, where they defeated [[Luxembourg national football team|the home team]] 4-0 in a [[Football World Cup 2006|2006 World Cup]] qualifying match. In the qualification stage of the European Championship 2008, Liechtenstein beat Latvia 1-0, a result which prompted the resignation of the Latvian coach. They went on to beat Iceland 3-0 on October 17, 2007, which is considered one of the most dramatic losses of the Icelandic national football team.

As an [[Alps|alpine]] country, the main sporting opportunity for Liechtensteiners to excel is in winter sports such as [[downhill skiing]]: the country's single ski area is [[Malbun]]. [[Hanni Wenzel]] won two gold medals and one silver medal in the 1980 [[Olympic Winter Games|Winter Olympics]] (she won bronze in 1976), and her brother [[Andreas Wenzel|Andreas]] won one silver medal in 1980 and one bronze medal in 1984 in the Giant Slalom event. With nine medals overall (all in alpine skiing), Liechtenstein has won more Olympic medals ''per capita'' than any other nation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Per Capita Olympic Medal Table|url=http://users.skynet.be/hermandw/olymp/reloly.html|accessdate=2009-01-24}}</ref> It is also the smallest nation to win a medal in any Olympics, Winter or Summer, and the only nation to win a medal in the Winter Games but not in the Summer Games. Other notable skiers from Liechtenstein are [[Marco B<U+00FC>chel]], [[Willi Frommelt]], [[Paul Frommelt]] and [[Ursula Konzett]].

[[Amateur radio]] is a hobby of some nationals and visitors. However, unlike virtually every other sovereign nation, Liechtenstein does not have its own [[ITU Prefix]]. It uses Switzerland's callsign prefixes (typically "HB") followed by a zero.

==Military==
Liechtenstein follows a policy of neutrality and is [[List of countries without armed forces|one of few countries in the world]] that maintains no military. The army was abolished soon after the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in which Liechtenstein fielded an army of 80 men, although they were not involved in any fighting. The demise of the [[German Confederation]] in that war freed Liechtenstein from its international obligation to maintain an army, and parliament seized this opportunity and refused to provide funding for an army. The prince objected, as such a move would leave the country defenseless, but relented on 12 February 1868, and disbanded the force. The last soldier to serve under the colours of Liechtenstein died in 1939 at the age of 95.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beattie|first=David|title=Liechtenstein: A Modern History|location=London|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris]]|year=2004|page=30|isbn=185043459X}}</ref> Order within the country is kept by a small police force.
