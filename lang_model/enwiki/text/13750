'''St Wulfran's Church''', dedicated to [[Wulfram of Sens]], a 7th-century French [[archbishop]],<ref name="Dale205">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p205 }}</ref> is an [[Anglican]] church in [[Ovingdean]], a rural village now within the [[England|English]] city of [[Brighton and Hove]].  Parts of the structure date from the early 12th century, and the church is [[Listed building|listed at Grade I]],<ref name="IoEStWulfran">{{cite web|title=Images of England <U+2014> detailed record, Church of St Wulfran, Greenways (west side), Brighton|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=480790&mode=quick|work=[[Images of England]]|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|year=2007|accessdate=2008-08-31}}</ref> a designation used for buildings "of outstanding architectural or historic interest".

==History==
A church existed in Ovingdean at the time of the [[Domesday Book]],<ref name="Dale205"/> which recorded it as an [[:wikt:ecclesiola|ecclesiola]] ("little church").<ref name="Whitman116">{{cite book |last=Whitman |first=Ken |coauthors=Joyce Whitman |title=Ancient Churches of Sussex |origyear=1994 |publisher=Roedale Books |location=Brighton |isbn=0-9522560-0-2 |pages=p116 }}</ref>  This was rebuilt in the early 12th century, and most sources agree that no trace of the [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Saxon-era]] building remains.<ref name="Dale205"/><ref name="Whitman116"/>  The 12th-century [[chancel]] and [[nave]] form the basis of the present structure.  A tower was added at the west end in the 13th century,<ref name="IoEStWulfran"/> as was an [[aisle]] on the south side (reached by twin archways cut through from the nave).<ref name="Dale205"/>  This aisle no longer exists, and its fate is uncertain; however, ancient scorch marks and discoloured brickwork in the south wall of the nave suggest fire damage by the same French raiders who destroyed neighbouring [[Rottingdean]]'s [[St Margaret's Church, Rottingdean|St Margaret's]] in 1377.  (A stone tablet in the church also makes this claim.)<ref name="Dale205"/><ref name="Whitman116"/>

There were no significant alterations for several centuries after the tower was added, apart from a porch on the south side in the early 19th century, but like many ancient churches in the Brighton area St Wulfran's was subjected to a major restoration in the [[Victorian era]].  This took place from 1865 to 1867, and involved the rebuilding of the chancel arches to form one large central arch flanked by two smaller ones, replacement of all the [[pew]]s, and new panelling and roof timbers in the chancel.<ref name="IoEStWulfran"/><ref name="Dale206">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p206 }}</ref>  These were designed and painted by [[Charles Eamer Kempe]], who had been born in the village and who later became a noted [[stained glass]] designer.  Before his death in 1907, he provided seven windows for the church; he also designed a [[rood screen]] for the chancel, which was carved in the German village of [[Oberammergau]].<ref name="Dale206"/>  (The village, famous for its woodcarving tradition, also supplied an intricately carved [[reredos]] to [[St Martin's Church, Brighton|St Martin's Church]] in Brighton's Round Hill district.)<ref name="Dale140">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p140 }}</ref>  There are other painted and stencilled panels from the 19th century throughout the church, representing various Biblical scenes.  The [[reredos]] was also designed in the late 19th century, and depicts various figures including [[St Richard of Chichester]].<ref name="Dale206"/><ref name="Dale207">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p207 }}</ref>

[[Image:St Wulfran's Church, Ovingdean 12.jpg|thumb|left|View across the churchyard from the southwest, showing the yew tree by the entrance door]]
A chapel was built on the south side in 1907.<ref name="Dale207"/>  One had been planned since the 12th-century rebuild, when an archway intended to lead to it was provided in the wall of the chancel.<ref name="Dale205"/>  A vestry was added in an architecturally complementary style in the mid-1980s.<ref name="IoEStWulfran"/><ref name="Dale207"/><ref name="StW-History"/>

The churchyard surrounds the church on three sides, and is home to an ancient [[Taxus baccata|yew]] tree which may be up to 1,000 years old.<ref name="Dale207"/>  [[William Willett]], a campaigner for [[daylight saving time]], and Brighton-born inventor [[Magnus Volk]]<U+2014>a pioneering [[electrical engineer]] who built an early electric car and the [[Volk's Railway]], the world's oldest surviving electric railway<ref name="VER">{{cite web|title=Welcome to Volk's Electric Railway<U+2014>the official site of the Volk's Electric Railway Association|url=http://volkselectricrailway.co.uk/|accessdate=2008-09-04|publisher=Volk's Electric Railway Association|year=2008|work=Volk's Electric Railway Association website}}</ref><U+2014>are buried in the churchyard.  Members of the Kemp(e) family,<ref group=note>Charles was born with the surname ''Kemp'', but added the ''e'' later.</ref> including Charles Eamer Kempe himself, are also buried there.  Nathaniel Kemp, who built the 18th-century Ovingdean Hall, the main building in the village, and his wife Martha share a tomb on the south side of the church; the tombstone was designed by Charles, who was later buried in the same tomb.<ref name="Dale207"/>  The grave of [[Helena Normanton]], the first woman to practise as a [[barrister]] in the United Kingdom, can also be found.  Resident in Brighton since the age of four, she campaigned for various rights for women, such as advocating the use of [[maiden name]]s professionally and recommending that women save any spare housekeeping money for their own use.  She was also the first benefactor of the nearby [[University of Sussex]].  The Jex-Blake family, who lived in Brighton for a time, have a large, ornate tomb in the churchyard, although their most notable member is not buried there.  [[Sophia Jex-Blake]] is commemorated on the memorial stone, however.  She overcame opposition to train as one of the first female doctors in the United Kingdom, helped to found the [[London School of Medicine for Women|London]] and [[Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women|Edinburgh Schools of Medicine for Women]], and started a women's and children's hospital in Edinburgh.<ref name="StW-Churchyard">{{cite web|title=St Wulfran's churchyard|url=http://www.mybrightonandhove.org.uk/page_id__6599.aspx|accessdate=2008-09-06|publisher=My Brighton and Hove (c/o QueensPark Books)|date=2006-03-22|work=My Brighton and Hove website}}</ref>

The dedication to Wulfram of Sens (in any spelling) is very rare.

==Architecture==
[[Image:St Wulfran's Church, Ovingdean 04.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lychgate]] at the churchyard entrance]]
St Wulfran's Church is built entirely of [[flint]],<ref name="Dale206"/> other than narrow stone [[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]] at the corners of walls.  Although churches incorporating some flint are common in [[Sussex]], St Wulfran's is the only all-flint church in the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]].<ref name="MBaH-Wulfran"/>  The roof was originally [[slate]], but tiles have replaced most of the slate slabs.<ref name="Dale205"/><ref name="IoEStWulfran"/>  The two-stage tower is topped with a shallow pyramid-shaped [[spire]] of a design known as the "Sussex Cap",<ref name="Whitman116"/> and has a circular [[corbel]] of similar height in its southeastern corner.<ref name="IoEStWulfran"/>

There are [[lancet window]]s of various sizes on all sides of the church and in the tower.<ref name="IoEStWulfran"/>  Kempe's stained glass can be found in one of the tower windows, the south chapel, the north wall (three windows) and the south wall (two).<ref name="Dale206"/>  Internally, there are several arches, some with pointed tops and [[chamfer]]ing; in particular, there are three arched entrances to the chapel on the south side, and a blocked entrance to the former south aisle.<ref name="IoEStWulfran"/>

The churchyard is entered on the east side through a steep-roofed [[lychgate]] with recessed seating.  "Holiness unto the Lord" is carved on one of the wooden beams.

==The church today==
St Wulfran's received its Grade I listing on 13 October 1952.<ref name="IoEStWulfran"/>  The [http://www.achurchnearyou.com/parish.php?p=10/109 parish] covers a rural area; Ovingdean village is the only significant area of housing.  It reaches the southern boundary of [[Woodingdean]], the eastern boundary of the [[Whitehawk]] estate and the northern edge of [[Rottingdean]], and incorporates East Brighton Golf Club and surrounding areas of [[South Downs|downland]].

There are two [[Eucharist]]ic services on Sunday mornings and another every Wednesday, and prayer groups and study groups meet at the church monthly.<ref name="StW-What">{{cite web|title=Welcome to St Wulfran's Parish Church|url=http://www.stwulfrans.com/what.php|accessdate=2008-09-04|publisher=St. Wulfran's PCC|year=2005|work=St Wulfran's Church website}}</ref>
