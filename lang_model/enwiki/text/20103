The '''Japan national rugby union team''' (often known as the '''Cherry Blossoms''' or more recently the '''Brave Blossoms''') represent [[Japan]] in international [[rugby union]] competitions. Japan is traditionally the strongest rugby union power in Asia but has both enjoyed and endured mixed results against non-Asian teams over the years. Rugby union in Japan is administered by the [[Japan Rugby Football Union]] (JRFU), which was founded in 1926. They compete annually in the [[Pacific Nations Cup]] and the [[Asian Five Nations]]. They have also participated in every [[Rugby World Cup]] since the tournament began in 1987. However they have only ever won one game at the tournament, against [[Zimbabwe national rugby union team|Zimbabwe]] in [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]].

Rugby was introduced to Japan in 1899 and Japan's first international was a match against a Canadian team in 1932. Notable games for Japan include a victory over the Junior All Blacks in 1968, and a narrow 6<U+2013>3 loss to [[England national rugby union team|England]] in 1971. Famous wins by Japan include a 28<U+2013>24 victory over a Scotland XV in 1989 and a 23-8 victory over Wales in 2013. In the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], Japan drew 12<U+2013>12 against Canada, their second best result in the tournament. In 2011, Japan displayed the extent of its progress in the sport by winning the [[2011 IRB Pacific Nations Cup]], played against [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]], [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]] and [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]].

==History==
{{Main|Rugby union in Japan}}
The first recorded instance of rugby being played in Japan was in 1874, when British sailors staged a game in Yokohama. The sport was introduced to students at Keio University in 1899 by Professor [[Edward Bramwell Clarke]] and [[Tanaka Ginnosuke]]. Japan's first international match took place on 31 January 1932 when a trade delegation from Canada brought the [[Canada national rugby union team]], who were also playing their first game. The Japanese won 9<U+2013>8.

Japan beat the [[Junior All Blacks]] 23<U+2013>19 in 1968 after losing the first four matches on a tour of New Zealand, but they won the last five. The Japanese (coached by [[Waseda University Rugby Football Club|Waseda University]] Professor [[Onishi Tetsunosuke]]) lost by just 3<U+2013>6 to England in Tokyo on 29 September 1971 in the [[RFU]]'s centenary year. The [[1973 Japan rugby union tour of Wales, England and France]] was less successful with the side winning only two of their eleven matches, and losing the international matches against Wales and France. Ten years later Japan gave Wales a fright in losing by a slim five-point margin, 24<U+2013>29, at [[Cardiff Arms Park]] on 2 October 1983.

On 28 May 1989, a strong Japan coached by [[Hiroaki Shukuzawa]] defeated an [[test match (rugby union)|uncapped]] [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]], missing nine British Lions on tour in Australia, for the first time at [[Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium]], 28<U+2013>24. The Japan team included such Kobe Steel stalwarts as centre [[Seiji Hirao]] (captain), and locks [[Atsushi Oyagi]] and [[Toshiyuki Hayashi]] (38 Japan caps and a member of Oxford University's all-time best XV). [[Sinali Latu]] at No. 8 was then a fourth year student at Daito Bunka University, and speedy [[Yoshihito Yoshida]] on the wing (no. 14) was a third year at Meiji University. Scotland missed an incredible seven penalties and refused the kicking tee which was generously offered <U+2013> as a surviving video of the game shows. It was almost the same Japanese team which defeated [[Zimbabwe national rugby union team|Zimbabwe]] in [[1991 Rugby Union World Cup|RWC1991]].

===Under Shogo Mukai (2001<U+2212>2003)===
After Hirao resigned, [[Toshiba Brave Lupus]] coach [[Shogo Mukai]] was appointed in March 2001 to lead Japan up to the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]]. After mixed fortunes in his first two years in charge, Japan put in some impressive performances at the tournament with good efforts against {{nrut|Scotland}} and {{nrut|France}}, nevertheless they still left the tournament having failed to reach their target of winning some matches but still won admirers for their exciting brand of play. Mukai left his post after the tournament to spend more time with his family.

===Under Mitsutake Hagimoto (2004<U+2212>2005)===

After Shogo Mukai left after the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]], the JRFU initially tried to appoint [[Eddie Jones (rugby union)|Eddie Jones]] from his post with {{nrut|Australia}} but were unsuccessful and instead appointed [[Mitsutake Hagimoto]] in March 2004 after he won the inaugural Top League with the [[Kobelco Steelers]]. Under Hagimoto, Japan decided they would not select foreign born players after Mukai had been criticised for playing too many at the World Cup.

Hagimoto's first match in charge was a disappointing draw with {{nrut|Korea}}, but his first few matches in charge after that were promising with wins over {{nrut|Russia}} and {{nrut|Canada}} to win the Super Powers Cup and pushed {{nrut|Italy}} close losing 32<U+2212>19.

However in November 2004, Japan went on a disastrous tour to Europe where they were embarrassingly thrashed 100<U+2212>8 by {{nrut|Scotland}} and 98-0 by {{nrut|Wales}} and also were comfortably defeated by {{nrut|Romania}}. Japan's performances were described as "pathetic", and the squad was called "a joke" with some key players ignored or not given permission to travel.

This disastrous tour forced a rethink from Hagimoto and foreign born players were brought back into the side in 2005, but after losing twice to {{nrut|Ireland}} in June he was sacked and with just 5 wins from 15 matches was the least successful coach for Japan in the professional era.

===Under Jean-Pierre <U+00C9>lissalde (2005<U+2013>2006)===
[[File:Japan v Tonga at Kitakyushu.JPG|right|thumb|Japan play Tonga at [[Honjo stadium]] on 4 June 2006]]

After Hagimoto left his post at the end of June 2005, [[Jean-Pierre <U+00C9>lissalde]] who had been appointed backs coach three months earlier took full charge and became the first foreigner to be the head coach for Japan. His first match in charge was a 44<U+2212>29 win over {{nrut|Spain}} in November 2005.

In 2006, despite a disappointing campaign in the inaugural Pacific Nations Cup in June where Japan lost all their matches, and also lost to heavily to {{nrut|Italy}} 52-6, <U+00C9>lissalde was backed to lead the side to the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. But <U+00C9>lissalde was later sacked in September after he took on a job with [[Aviron Bayonnais|Bayonne]] without consulting the JRFU and then refused to give up his job with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/5384774.stm|title=Elissalde sacked as Japan coach}}</ref> Assistant coach [[Osamu Ota]] took over as caretaker coach for two Rugby World Cup qualifiers in November 2006.

===Under John Kirwan (2007<U+2013>2011)===
[[File:Japan v Australia A IRB Pac Nations 2008 June 8.JPG|right|thumb|Japan plays Australia A on 8 June 2008]]

[[John Kirwan (rugby player)|John Kirwan]] was appointed head coach on in October 2006 after Elissalde was sacked. He initially worked as an advisor to caretaker coach [[Osamu Ota]] before taking over the job completely in 2007.

After starting with large wins over the Asian opposition, Japan only won one of their remaining 10 fixtures in 2007, although in the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] they did gain a draw with a last minute touchline conversion from [[Shotaro Onishi]] against [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]] to end a long losing streak of World Cup matches stretching back to 1991.

Results began to pick up after the 2007 World Cup and Kirwan led Japan up to a high of 13th in the IRB Rankings and to win their first ever [[2011 IRB Pacific Nations Cup|Pacific Nations Cup]] title in 2011 after they beat {{nrut|Fiji}} away for the first ever time in Japan's history.

However despite more positive results in between World Cups, Japan had a disappointing [[2011 Rugby World Cup]], losing 31<U+2212>18 to {{nrut|Tonga}} who they had beaten four consecutive times in a row since 2008, and drawing again to {{nrut|Canada}} who they had beaten 46<U+2212>8 and 27<U+2212>6 in 2009, and Japan left the World Cup winless meaning they still hadn't won a match at the tournament since 1991. Kirwan came under pressure after the tournament and he resigned from his post after his contract came to the end at the end of the year.

The tenure of Kirwan as coach was notable for a large amount of imports he selected. Players who originated from [[New Zealand]] such as [[James Arlidge]], [[Bryce Robins]], [[Shaun Webb]], [[Ryan Nicholas]], [[Luke Thompson (rugby union)|Luke Thompson]] or [[Tonga]] such as [[Alisi Tupuailei]] and [[Sione Vatuvei]] all featured prominently under Kirwan. The large percentage of foreigners in the national team also caused criticism for Kirwan. However despite failing to bring Japan a World Cup win, Kirwan left his post as the most successful Japan coach of the professional era with a win rate of 58.18% from 55 matches.

===Under Eddie Jones (2012<U+2013>)===
Kirwan chose not to renew his contract as head coach when it expired at the end of 2011, and the Japan Rugby Football Union announced that former Australia coach, [[Eddie Jones (rugby union)|Eddie Jones]], would be his successor.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-union/union-news/eddie-jones-appointed-coach-of-japan-20111226-1pa6c.html|title= Eddie Jones appointed coach of Japan|author= |date= December 26, 2011|work= Sydney Morning Herald|publisher= Fairfax Media|accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref>  Jones stated that his intention was to take the Japanese national team into the top 10 on the international rankings, and that they must develop a style of play to allow them to win games against teams such as Scotland and Wales.

Jones made his debut as Japan head coach against [[Kazakhstan national rugby union team|Kazakhstan]]. He had selected a total of 10 uncapped players out of the 22 selected players. They went on to win the match 87<U+2212>0. They then had a big win over [[United Arab Emirates national rugby union team|United Arab Emirates]] where young 18 year old [[Yoshikazu Fujita]] set a new [[Asian Five Nations]] record for the most tries in a single match with a total of 6. This was also Fujita's international debut.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://jrfu.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=694:fujita-in-line-for-historic-debut&catid=39:mens-15-a-side|title= Fujita in line for historic debut|author= JRFU|date= May 2, 2012}}</ref>

In 2013, Jones led Japan to their sixth consecutive championship win in the [[Asian Five Nations]], where Japan achieved a tournament record score of 121<U+2212>0 against the [[Philippines national rugby union team|Philippines]]. In May, the nation lost their opening match of the [[2013 IRB Pacific Nations Cup]] to [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]], followed by a defeat to [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]] in the second round. Following these matches, Japan faced a [[2013 Wales rugby union tour of Japan|2-test series]] against [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] (although due to lions duty 15 players were in Australia) of which the series ended in a 1<U+2212>1 draw. Japan lost narrowly, 18<U+2212>22, in the first test, but won the second test 23<U+2212>8. This was the first time that Japan had recorded a victory over the Welsh.

On 16 October 2013, Jones was hospitalised after having a suspected [[stroke]] and was released from hospital 2 days later on 18 October 2013.<ref name="http://www.abc.net">{{cite web| url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-16/jones-suffers-suspected-stroke/5027204 | title = Eddie Jones hospitalised after Japan rugby coach suffers suspected stroke - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) | accessdate = 2013-10-17 }}</ref><ref name="dailytelegraph">{{cite web| url = http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/rugby/eddie-jones-released-from-intensive-care-after-stroke-but-will-miss-japans-test-with-all-blacks/story-fni2fxyf-1226742788198 | title = Eddie Jones released from intensive care after stroke but will miss Japan's Test with All Blacks | accessdate = 2013-10-18 }}</ref> With the announcement of his release from hosptial, it was announced that Jones will miss Japan's [[2013 end-of-year rugby union tests]] against [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]], [[Gloucester Rugby|Gloucester]], [[Russia national rugby union team|Russia]] and [[Spain national rugby union team|Spain]], and former [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] skills coach and current technical adviser for Japan [[Scott Wisemantel]] will interim coach Japan for their 2013 end-of-year rugby union tests.<ref name="Scott Wisemantel">{{cite web| url = http://www.japonrugby.net/scott-wisemantel-entraineur-par-interim-du-japon.php | accessdate = 2013-10-18 }}</ref>

==Rugby World Cup==
{{Main|Japan at the Rugby World Cup}}

Japan has participated in the [[Rugby World Cup]] since its inception in 1987, and has made appearances in all tournaments thus far. Despite this, they have experienced little success, with just one victory over [[Zimbabwe national rugby union team|Zimbabwe]] in [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]], and two draws with [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]] in [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007]] and 2011. They will be the home team for the [[2019 Rugby World Cup]], which is to be held in Japan.
