'''''Charmbracelet''''' is the ninth studio album by American [[singer-songwriter]] [[Mariah Carey]], released on December&nbsp;3,&nbsp;2002 through [[Island Records]] and [[MonarC Entertainment]]. The album was her first release since her breakdown following the release of her film ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'' (2001) and its [[Glitter (soundtrack)|accompanying soundtrack album]], both of which were critical and commercial failures. Critics described ''Charmbracelet'' as one of her most personal records, following 1997's ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&p_theme=sl&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0FCA5DF4A394B9C3&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Carey Puts on Her 'Charmbracelet', Hits the Road for Rare Tour|last=Johnson|first=Kevin C.|newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]|date=July 31, 2003|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref> Throughout the project, Carey collaborated with several songwriters and producers, including [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]], [[Channel 7 (musician)|7 Aurelius]] and [[Dre & Vidal]].

According to Carey, love is the album's main theme, and the songs combine introspective and personal themes with celebration and fun.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Mariah Carey: The Truth About Her Breakdown|journal=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|publisher=Alpha Media Group|issn=1534-0554|location=[[New York City]]|date=December 25, 2002}}</ref> The album contains a mixture of  [[Pop music|pop]] ballads and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] beats, and the songs incorporate elements of other genres, such as [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[Soul music|soul]]. Compared to ''Glitter'', which featured a variety of sampled melodies from the 1980s, ''Charmbracelet'' has a more [[adult contemporary]] sound. [[Cam'ron]], [[Jay-Z]] and [[Freeway (rapper)|Freeway]] also appear on the album.

Critics gave ''Charmbracelet'' mixed reviews. Many wrote that although the songs were good, none of them stood out enough to make an impact. Some reviewers said that Carey's voice sounded thin, airy and damaged on the album. ''Charmbracelet'' debuted at number three on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, and sold 241,000 copies in its first week. The album peaked within the top 40 in seven countries, and attained top ten positions in Japan and Switzerland.

Three singles were released to promote the album. The lead single, "[[Through the Rain]]" became the most successful, reaching the top ten in Canada, Switzerland, Sweden and Italy and the United Kingdom. In the US, it topped the [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart, but stalled at number 81 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The follow-ups, "Boy (I Need You)" and "Bringin' On the Heartbreak", were not as commercially successful. Carey embarked on the [[Charmbracelet World Tour: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey|Charmbracelet World Tour]], and performed 69 shows in over eight months. She also performed on televised shows and promotional tours like the [[American Music Awards of 2003|30th annual American Music Awards]], ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' and ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.

{{Quote box|quote="Her carefully assembled new album resembles a computer preset in its soulless precision. But there's a reason. This tin ''Charmbracelet'' is a throwback to the soft and fuzzy Mariah the masses succumbed to in the 1990s before she began competing with DMX for street credibility.

Critics considered "Subtle Invitation" to be one of the album's strongest songs because of its "well executed" jazz influence. The song begins with the sounds of people dining, then introduces the strong bassline and drums. Towards the end of the song, Carey belts out the climax. Sarah Rodman from ''[[The Boston Herald]]'' described it as fascinating and wrote, "it sounds as though Carey is singing in falsetto while still in her chest voice."<ref name=boston/> "Clown" drew strong media attention, and its lyrical content led critics to speculate that Carey aimed it at rapper [[Eminem]], who had publicly announced that he had had a relationship with Carey. Rodman said "Clown" was "languidly sinister", with lyrics such as, "I should've left it at 'I like your music too'&nbsp;...&nbsp;You should never have intimated we were lovers / when you know very well we never even touched each other."<ref name=boston>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/250796631.html?dids=250796631:250796631&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Dec+03%2C+2002&author=Sarah+Rodman&pub=Boston+Herald&desc=Carey+hopes+promotion+efforts+work+like+a+charm&pqatl=google|title=Carey Hopes Promotion Efforts Work Like a Charm |last=Rodman |first=Sarah |work=The Boston Globe |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=December 3, 2002 |accessdate=June 13, 2011|subscription=yes}}</ref> Critics compared "I Only Wanted" with "[[My All]]"{{'}}s instrumentation and structure of verse, chorus and guitar solo.

"Sunflowers for Alfred Roy", one of the album's most personal songs, is named after Carey's father; she makes direct reference to him and a moment they shared at his death bed.<ref name=Sanneh/><ref name=ewreview/> The song is backed with a simple piano accompaniment, and Carey recounts a visit with her father in his hospital room: "Strange to feel that proud, strong man / Grip tightly to my hand."<ref name=Sanneh/><ref name=ewreview/>

Upon its release, critics gave ''Charmbracelet'' mixed reviews. The main criticism concerned its content; many reviewers felt that although the songs were good, none stood out enough to make much of an impact on radio or the market. Some critics were concerned about the condition of Carey's voice, which they felt had become thin, airy and damaged when compared to her vocals throughout the early 1990s. Review aggregator [[Metacritic]], which averages professional reviews into a numerical score, gave the album 43/100, indicating "generally mixed or average reviews."<ref name="metac">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/charmbracelet|title=Charmbracelet&nbsp;<U+2013> Mariah Carey|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=February 5, 2011}}</ref> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[Allmusic]] rated the album two out of five stars, and criticized its production and the condition of Carey's voice.<ref name=allmusic/> He wrote, "Whenever she sings, there's a raspy whistle behind her thin voice and she strains to make notes throughout the record&nbsp;...&nbsp;Her voice is damaged, and there's not a moment where it sounds strong or inviting."<ref name=allmusic/> Tom Sinclair of  ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said she was "in fine voice", He wrote that "Through the Rain" sinks in its own sodden sentimentality, as do by-the-numbers efforts like 'Yours' and 'I Only Wanted'{{sp}}", and added that "{{'}}Clown' is a moody number graced with mournful acoustic guitar and a gorgeously nuanced vocal, while 'Sunflowers for Alfred Roy' is a short, sweet song sung to a lovely piano accompaniment". He finished by saying that "too much of ''Charmbracelet'' is mired in middle-of-the-road muck."<ref name=ewreview>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,397173,00.html|title=Mariah Carey: Charmbracelet|last=Sinclair|first=Tom|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Warner|date=December 9, 2002|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>

''Billboard'' editor Michael Paoletta praised Carey's return to her adult contemporary beginnings.<ref name=review/> He said that although Carey might have alienated her hip-hop followers from her previous three albums, her older fans from the 1990s would be more receptive to the material and her new image.<ref name=review/> Kelefa Sanneh from ''The New York Times'' wrote that the album "is generally pleasant, although it's not always exciting, and a few of the collaborations go awry". He called Carey's voice "invariably astonishing", and said that "she can hit high notes that barely sound human", praised her versatility, and wrote that she "also knows how to make a hip-hop hit by holding back and letting the beat shine."<ref name=Sanneh/> Ethan Browne of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' slated the album's whimsical chimes and tinkling keyboards, and wrote, "Was Charmbracelet recorded in a Casio shop? This instrument needs to be stopped."<ref name=pop/>

Rating ''Charmbracelet'' two out of five stars, Barry Walters from ''Rolling Stone'' wrote that none of the songs were bold, that the lack of hooks made the album weak, and said, "Carey needs bold songs that help her use the power and range for which she is famous. Charmbracelet is like a stream of watercolors that bleed into a puddle of brown."<ref name=rsreview/> Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine complimented Carey's mixture of pop and hip-hop melodies, and wrote, "Though there's nothing as immediate as 'Fantasy' or 'My All' here, Charmbracelet is significantly less contrived than 1999's ''Rainbow'' and almost as creatively liberating as ''Butterfly''.<ref name=slantreview/> British columnist Angus Batey, writing for [[Yahoo! Music|Yahoo! Music UK]] called the songs on ''Charmbracelet'' forgettable, and wrote, "She used to take risks, but 'Charmbracelet' is conservative, unadventurous and uninspiring; and, while it's understandable that simply to make another record marks a triumph of sorts, it's impossible to admire Mariah to the degree that her talent ought to merit."<ref name=yahoouk/> John Mulvey from ''[[NME]]'' criticized its content, writing, "Nominally, 'Charmbracelet' is R&B, much like Tony Blair is nominally a socialist&nbsp;...&nbsp;Tragedies, all told, have been worse"<ref name=nme/>
