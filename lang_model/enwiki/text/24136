'''Thorndon''' is a former parliamentary [[New Zealand electorates|electorate]] in the city of [[Wellington]], New Zealand from 1881 to 1890.

==Population centres==
The previous electoral redistribution was undertaken in 1875 for the [[New Zealand general election, 1875<U+2013>76|1875<U+2013>76 election]]. In the six years since, New Zealand's European population had increased by 65%. In the 1881 electoral redistribution, the [[House of Representatives of New Zealand|House of Representatives]] increased the number of European representatives to 91 (up from 84 since the 1875<U+2013>76 election). The number of M<U+0101>ori electorates was held at four. The House further decided that electorates should not have more than one representative, which led to 35 new electorates being formed, including Thorndon, and two electorates that had previously been abolished to be recreated. This necessitated a major disruption to existing boundaries.{{sfn|McRobie |1989 |pp=43<U+2013>48}}

The electorate was based on the inner-city suburb of [[Thorndon, New Zealand|Thorndon]]. The boundaries were defined as follows:<ref name="Representation Act 1881">{{cite web|title=Representation Act 1881(45 VICT 1881 No 14)|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/ra188145v1881n14263/|publisher=New Zealand Legal Information Institute |accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref>

<blockquote>The district is bounded towards the West, North, and East by the limits of the Borough of Wellington, to a point in line with the continuation of Taranaki Street, thence by that line and street to Taranaki Place; towards the South by Taranaki Place, Dixon Street, Woolcombe Street, Mount Street, the road leading to and by Upland Farm, to the boundary of the borough.</blockquote>
