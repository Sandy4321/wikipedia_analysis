"'''Gump Roast'''" is the seventeenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<U+2019> [[The Simpsons (season 13)|thirteenth season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the [[United States]] on April 21, 2002 . In the episode, [[Homer Simpson]] is honored by the townspeople at a Friars' Club Roast, until it is interrupted by [[Kang and Kodos]].<ref>{{harvnb|McCann|2005|pp=46<U+2013>47}}</ref> 

The episode was directed by [[Mark Kirkland]] and was written by [[Dan Castellaneta]] and his wife [[Deb Lacusta]]. The plot idea for the episode came about when ''The Simpsons'' cast members were on hiatus following a payment dispute. This is the fifth and, so far, the last clip show ''The Simpsons'' has produced. Instead, the series implements one "trilogy episode" each season. When it was first broadcast, "Gump Roast" received a 5.7 rating and was watched by 12.2 million viewers, making it the 16th most watched television show of the night. However, following its release on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]], the episode received negative reviews from critics.

==Plot==
[[Homer Simpson]] sits on a park bench holding a box of chocolates, when [[Chief Wiggum]] appears to arrest him for impersonating a movie character. Homer tells Wiggum a story that he is not interested in at first, but becomes more intrigued when Homer uses flashbacks to help him tell the story. The Simpson family then arrives to take Homer to the Friars<U+2019> Club, where he is [[Roast (comedy)|roasted]] by [[Krusty the Clown]] and other prominent citizens of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. Among those roasting him are his son [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], his daughter [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], and his boss [[Mr. Burns]] who tries to warn the people of Springfield of Homer's incompetence which, much to his dismay, they think is a joke. The roasters utilize more clips from previous episodes.

Soon, [[Kang and Kodos]] arrive at the roast and declare that humans are stupid, as demonstrated by more clips. However, when they probe Homer's baby daughter [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]'s brain and see her memories through a monitor, they at first demonstrate what looks like crying with joy. However, they later reveal that they were vomiting from their eyes. Just as they announce destruction of the [[Earth]], Maggie's mind reveals more clips that show Kang and Kodos something on Earth that makes it worth sparing: celebrities. However, they agree to spare the Earth if everyone agrees to give them a place in the People's Choice Awards. The episode ends with the song "They<U+2019>ll Never Stop the Simpsons," which recounts additional past plots, possible future plots, and an apology for airing this clip show.

==Production==
[[Image:Dan Castellaneta cropped.jpg|170px|left|thumb|[[Dan Castellaneta]] (pictured) wrote the episode with his wife [[Deb Lacusta]].]]
"Gump Roast" was co-written by [[Dan Castellaneta]] and his wife [[Deb Lacusta]], while [[Mark Kirkland]] served as director. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April 21, 2002.<ref name="Jean">Jean, Al. (2010). Commentary for "Gump Roast", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The idea for the episode came about when Castellaneta and the other main ''Simspons'' cast members were on hiatus while renegotiating their salaries. During the hiatus, Lacusta and Castellaneta were discussing the film ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' and questioned whether the stories Gump told actually happened, or if he made them up. They then compared the character to Homer, since they are both dimwitted and have "fumbled into" many different situations. Writing ensued, and when the cast members had settled the payment issue, Castellaneta and Lacusta presented the script to [[show runner]] [[Al Jean]], who put the script into production.<ref name="Lacusta">Lacusta, Deb. (2010). Commentary for "Gump Roast", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>

The clip in which Homer skis down a mountain is one of the most used clips during events, according to Jean. One of the plot turns in the episode sees Kang and Kodos interrupting the roast. These characters normally only appear in Halloween episodes, however since "Gump Roast" is a clip show and therefore not in ''The Simpsons'' canon, Kang and Kodos were included in the episode. Since "Gump Roast," there has not been any more clip shows of ''The Simpsons''. Jean stated in the DVD commentary for the episode, that since the show produces a "trilogy episode" (an episode with a different story in each act) each season, making a clip show would be unnecessary.<ref name="Jean" />

==Cultural references==
The opening scene, which shows Homer sitting on a bench holding a box of chocolate, is a reference to the movie ''Forrest Gump''. The song playing at the end of the episode was written by ''Simpsons'' writer [[Matt Selman]] and sung by Castellaneta. It is a parody on the song <U+201C>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]<U+201D> by [[Billy Joel]], and was originally the same length as the song it was based on. However, because the episode was too long, the song had to be cut to its current length.<ref name="Selman">Selman, Matt. (2010). Commentary for "Gump Roast", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The act that [[Ned Flanders]] and [[Reverend Lovejoy]] are performing at the roast is an homage to the [[Smothers Brothers]], who would later appear on ''The Simpsons'' in the episode <U+201C>[[O Brother, Where Bart Thou?]].<U+201D><ref name="Jean" />

Following the home video release of the thirteenth season of ''The Simpsons'', "Gump Roast" received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics. Both Ron Martin of 411Mania and Adam Rayner of Obsessed with Film wrote that the episode's premise is "lazy," and Rayner added that he felt "cheated."<ref name="Obsessedwithfilm">{{cite web|url=http://www.obsessedwithfilm.com/reviews/dvd-review-the-simpsons-season-13.php |title= DVD Review: THE SIMPSONS SEASON 13 |date=September 20, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2011 |last=Raynor|first=Adam|publisher=Obsessed With Film}}</ref><ref name="411mania">{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/movies/dvd_reviews/153026 |title=The Simpsons Season 13 DVD Review |date=September 15, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2011|last=Martin|first=Ron|publisher=411Mania}}</ref> Andre Dellamorte of Collider was negative as well, writing that the episode <U+201C>does a very poor job at justifying its existence."<ref name="collider">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/the-simpsons-thirteenth-season-blu-ray-review/49587/ |title=THE SIMPSONS: Thirteenth Season Blu-ray Review |date=September 17, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2011|last=Dellamorte |first=Andre |publisher=''Collider''}}</ref> The episode's plot was criticized by reviewers; Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict called the plot "lackluster" and added that it "doesn't really make sense<U+2014>and I mean that last part in a bad way!"<ref name="DVDverdict">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsons13bluray.php |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season (Blu-Ray) |date=September 6, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2011|last=Malkowski|first=Jennifer|publisher=''DVD Verdict''}}</ref> Nate Boss of Project-Blu held a similar view, stated that the plot "made no sense" and that the episode as a whole was "complete lameness."<ref name="Project-blu">{{cite web|url=http://project-blu.com/reviews/simpsons13.html |title=The Simpsons: The Thirteenth Season |date=September 8, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2011 |last=Boss|first=Nate|publisher=Project-Blu}}</ref> Some reviewers considered the episode to be the worst of the season.<ref name="DVDverdict" /><ref name="411mania" /><ref name="collider" /> However, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide stated that, even though he thought the episode was "a cheap excuse for a new episode", he found that it "provokes more laughs than many of the other season 13 episodes since it quotes better programs from the past."<ref name="DVDmg">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonthirteen.shtml |title=<nowiki>The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season [Blu-Ray] (2001)</nowiki> |date=September 2, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2011 |last=Jacobsson|first=Colin|publisher=DVD Movie Guide}}</ref> Furthermore, the song at the end of the episode was well-received by Malkowski, who described it as the best moment of the episode.<ref name="DVDverdict" />
