'''Koine''' (from {{lang|grc|<U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+03BD><U+03AE>}} "common", also known as '''[[Alexandria]]n dialect''', '''common Attic''' or '''Hellenistic Greek''') was the common supra-regional form of [[Greek language|Greek]] spoken and written during [[hellenistic era|hellenistic]] and [[Roman empire|Roman]] antiquity. It developed through the spread of Greek following the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in the 4th century BC, and served as the common [[lingua franca]] of much of the Mediterranean region and the Middle East during the following centuries. It was based mainly on [[Attic Greek|Attic]] and related [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] speech forms, with various admixtures brought about through [[dialect levelling]] with other varieties.<ref name="Bubenik">{{cite book|last=Bubenik|first=V.|year=2007|chapter=The rise of Koin<U+00E9>|editor=A.

Literary Koine was the medium of much of post-classical Greek literary and scholarly writing, such as the works of [[Plutarch]] and [[Polybius]].<ref name="Bubenik"/> Koin<U+00E9> is also the language of the Christian [[New Testament]], of the [[Septuagint]] (the 3rd-century BC Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]]), and of most early Christian theological writing by the [[Church Fathers]]. In this context, Koine Greek is also known as "Biblical", "New Testament" or "patristic Greek".<ref>A history of ancient Greek by Maria Chrit<U+0113>, Maria Arapopoulou, Centre for the Greek Language (Thessalonik<U+0113>, Greece) pg 436 ISBN 0-521-83307-8</ref>

== Name ==
The word ''koin<U+0113>'' ({{lang|grc|<U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+03BD><U+03AE>}}) is the Greek word for "common", and is here understood as referring to "the common dialect" ({{lang|grc|<U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+03BD><U+1F74> <U+03B4><U+03B9><U+03AC><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}). The word is pronounced {{IPAc-en|'|k|<U+0254><U+026A>|n|e<U+026A>}} or {{IPAc-en|k|<U+0254><U+026A>|'|n|e<U+026A>}} in English. Its ancient Greek pronunciation would have been {{IPA-grc|koi<U+02C8>ne<U+02D0>}}, Modern Greek {{IPA-el|ci<U+02C8>ni|}}. The term was applied in several different sense by ancient scholars. A school of scholars such as [[Apollonius Dyscolus]] and [[Aelius Herodianus]] maintained the term ''Koine'' to refer to the [[Proto-Greek language]], while others would use it to refer to any vernacular form of Greek speech which differed somewhat from the literary language.<ref name=andriotes>Andriotis, Nikolaos P. ''History of the Greek Language''.</ref> 

When ''Koine'' Greek became a language of literature by the 1st century BC, some people distinguished it into two forms: written (Greek) as the literary post-classical form (which should never be confused with [[Atticism]]), and vernacular as the day to day spoken form.<ref name=andriotes/> Others chose to refer to ''Koine'' as the ''Alexandrian dialect'' ({{lang|grc|<U+1F21> <U+1F08><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03BE><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03AD><U+03C9><U+03BD> <U+03B4><U+03B9><U+03AC><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}) or ''the dialect of [[Alexandria]]'', or even the universal dialect of its time. The former was often used by modern classicists.

== Origins and history ==
[[File:Hellenistic Greek.png|thumb|240px|Dark blue: areas where Greek speakers probably were majoritary. Light blue: areas intensely hellenized{{date needed|date=March 2014}}{{source needed|date=March 2014}}]]

Koine Greek arose as a common dialect within the armies of [[Alexander the Great]].<ref name=andriotes/> Under the leadership of [[Macedon]], their newly formed common dialect was spoken from [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Egypt]] to [[Seleucid Empire|Mesopotamia]].<ref name=andriotes/> Though elements of Koine Greek took shape during the [[Classical Greece|Classical Era]], the post-Classical period of Greek is defined as beginning with the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC, when cultures under [[Hellenistic era|Hellenistic]] sway in turn began to influence the language.
The passage into the next period, known as [[Medieval Greek]], dates from the foundation of [[Constantinople]] by [[Constantine I]] in 330. The post-Classical period of Greek thus refers to the creation and evolution of Koine Greek throughout the entire Hellenistic and Roman eras of history until the start of the Middle Ages.<ref name=andriotes/>

The linguistic roots of the Common Greek dialect had been unclear since ancient times. During the [[Hellenistic]] age, most scholars thought of Koine as the result of the mixture of the four main [[Ancient Greek]] dialects, "{{lang|grc|<U+1F21> <U+1F10><U+03BA> <U+03C4><U+1FF6><U+03BD> <U+03C4><U+03B5><U+03C4><U+03C4><U+03AC><U+03C1><U+03C9><U+03BD> <U+03C3><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+1FF6><U+03C3><U+03B1>}}" (the composition of the Four). This view was supported in the early 20th century by [[Paul Kretschmer]] in his book "Die Entstehung der Koine" (1901), while [[Ulrich Wilamowitz]] and [[Antoine Meillet]], based on the intense Ionic elements of the Koine <U+2014> such as {{lang|grc|<U+03C3><U+03C3>}} instead of {{lang|grc|<U+03C4><U+03C4>}} and {{lang|grc|<U+03C1><U+03C3>}} instead of {{lang|grc|<U+03C1><U+03C1>}} ({{lang|grc|<U+03B8><U+03AC><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03C3><U+03B1> <U+2014> <U+03B8><U+03AC><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03C4><U+03B1>, <U+1F00><U+03C1><U+03C3><U+03B5><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03C2> <U+2014> <U+1F00><U+03C1><U+03C1><U+03B5><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03C2>}}) <U+2014> considered Koine to be a simplified form of [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]].<ref name=andriotes/> 

The final answer which is academically accepted today was given by the Greek linguist [[Georgios Hatzidakis|G. N. Hatzidakis]], who proved that, despite the "composition of the Four", the "stable nucleus" of Koine Greek is Attic. In other words, Koine Greek can be regarded as Attic with the admixture of elements especially from Ionic, but also from other dialects. The degree of importance of the non-Attic linguistic elements on Koine can vary depending on the region of the Hellenistic World.<ref name=andriotes/> 

In that respect, the varieties of Koine spoken in the [[Ionia]]n colonies of [[Asia Minor]] (e.g. [[Pontus]]) would have more intense [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] characteristics than others and those of Laconia and Cyprus would preserve some [[Doric Greek|Doric]] and [[Arcado-Cypriot]] characteristics, respectively etc. The literary Koine of the Hellenistic age resembles Attic in such a degree that it is often mentioned as ''Common Attic''.<ref name=andriotes/>

== Sources ==
The first scholars who studied Koine, both in Alexandrian and contemporary times, were classicists whose prototype had been the literary [[Attic Greek|Attic]] language of the Classical period, and would frown upon any other kind of [[Ancient Greek|Hellenic]] speech. Koine Greek was therefore considered a decayed form of Greek which was not worthy of attention.<ref name=andriotes/> 

The reconsideration on the historical and linguistic importance of Koine Greek began only in the early 19th century, where renowned scholars conducted a series of studies on the evolution of Koine throughout the entire [[Hellenistic]] and Roman period which it covered. The sources used on the studies of Koine have been numerous and of unequal reliability. The most significant ones are the inscriptions of the post-Classical periods and the [[papyrus|papyri]], for being two kinds of texts which have authentic content and can be studied directly.<ref name=andriotes/> 

Other significant sources are the [[Septuagint]], the somewhat literal Greek translation of the [[Old Testament]], and the [[New Testament]]. The teaching of the Testaments was aimed at the most common people, and for that reason they use the most popular language of the era. 

Information can also be derived from some [[Atticism|Atticist]] scholars of the [[Hellenistic]] and Roman periods, who, in order to fight the evolution of the language, published works which compared the supposedly "correct" [[Attic Greek|Attic]] against the "wrong" Koine by citing examples. For example, [[Phrynichus Arabius]] during the 2nd century AD wrote:

Other sources can be based on random findings such as inscriptions on vases written by popular painters, mistakes made by [[Atticism|Atticists]] due to their imperfect knowledge of pure [[Attic Greek|Attic]], or even some surviving Greco-Latin glossaries of the Roman period,<ref name = "Augsburg">[http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost03/Dositheus/dos_col3.html  Augsburg].</ref> e.g.:

Finally, a very important source of information on the ancient Koine is the [[modern Greek]] language with all its dialects and its own ''Koine'' form, which have preserved some of the ancient language's oral linguistic details which the written tradition has lost. For example the [[Pontic language|Pontic]] and [[Cappadocian Greek|Cappadocian]] dialects preserved the ancient pronunciation of {{lang|grc|<U+03B7> as <U+03B5> (<U+03BD><U+03CD><U+03C6><U+03B5>, <U+03C3><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03AD><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C2>, <U+03C4><U+03AF><U+03BC><U+03B5><U+03C3><U+03BF><U+03BD>, <U+03C0><U+03B5><U+03B3><U+03AC><U+03B4><U+03B9>}} etc.), while the [[Tsakonian language|Tsakonic]] preserved the long <U+03B1> instead of <U+03B7> ({{lang|grc|<U+1F01><U+03BC><U+03AD><U+03C1><U+03B1>, <U+1F00><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03C0><U+03AC>, <U+03BB><U+03AF><U+03BC><U+03BD><U+03B1>, <U+03C7><U+03BF><U+03AC>}} etc.) and the other local characteristics of [[Doric Greek|Laconic]].<ref name=andriotes/> 

Dialects from the Southern part of the Greek-speaking regions ([[Dodecanese]], [[Cyprus]] etc.), preserve the pronunciation of the double similar consonants ({{lang|grc|<U+1F04><U+03BB>-<U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03C2>, <U+1F19><U+03BB>-<U+03BB><U+03AC><U+03B4><U+03B1>, <U+03B8><U+03AC><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03C3>-<U+03C3><U+03B1>}}), while others pronounce in many words <U+03C5> as <U+03BF><U+03C5> or preserve ancient double forms ({{lang|grc|<U+03BA><U+03C1><U+03CC><U+03BC><U+03BC><U+03C5><U+03BF><U+03BD> <U+2014> <U+03BA><U+03C1><U+03B5><U+03BC>-<U+03BC><U+03C5><U+03BF><U+03BD>, <U+03C1><U+03AC><U+03BE> <U+2014> <U+03C1><U+03CE><U+03BE>}} etc.). Linguistic phenomena like the above imply that those characteristics survived within Koine, which in turn had countless variations in the Greek-speaking world.<ref name=andriotes/>

== Types ==
[[File:P46.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Papyrus 46]] is one of the oldest extant [[New Testament]] manuscripts in [[Greek language|Greek]], written on [[papyrus]], with its 'most probable date' between 175-225.]]

=== Biblical Koine ===
"Biblical Koine" refers to the varieties of Koine Greek used in the [[Greek Bible (disambiguation)|Greek Bible]] and related texts. Its main sources are:
* The [[Septuagint]], a 3rd-century BC Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|texts not included in the Hebrew Bible]];

* The [[New Testament manuscript|Greek New Testament]], compiled originally in Greek.

==== Septuagint Greek ====
There has been some debate to what degree biblical Greek represents the mainstream of contemporary spoken Koine and to what extent it contains specifically [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[substratum]] features. These could have been induced either through the practice of translating closely from [[Biblical Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] originals, or through the influence of the regional non-standard [[Hellenistic Judaism|Greek spoken by the originally Aramaic-speaking Jews]]. 

Some of the features discussed in this context are the Septuagint's normative absence of the particles <U+03BC><U+03AD><U+03BD> and <U+03B4><U+03AD>, and the use of <U+1F10><U+03B3><U+03AD><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03C4><U+03BF> to denote "it came to pass." Some features of biblical Greek which are thought to have originally been non-standard elements eventually found their way into the main of the Greek language.

==== New Testament Greek ====
The Greek of the New Testament is less distinctively Semitic than that of the Septuagint, partly because it appeared 300 years later and partly because [[Language of the New Testament|it is largely a de novo composition in Greek]], not primarily a translation from [[biblical Hebrew]] and [[biblical Aramaic]].<ref>[[Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare]](1856-1924) ''Grammar of Septuagint Greek''</ref>

=== Patristic Greek ===
The term ''patristic Greek'' is sometimes used for the Greek written by the [[Church Fathers#Greek Fathers|Greek Church Fathers]], the [[Early Christian]] theologians in late antiquity. Christian writers in the earliest time tended to use a simple register of Koin<U+00E9>, relatively close to the spoken language of their time, following the model of the Bible. After the 4th century, when [[State church of the Roman Empire|Christianity became the official state religion of the Roman Empire]], more learned registers of Koin<U+00E9> also came to be used.<ref>Horrocks (1997: ch.5.11.)</ref>

== Differences between Attic and Koine Greek ==
The study of all sources from the six centuries which are symbolically covered by Koine reveals linguistic changes from [[ancient Greek]] on elements of the spoken language including, [[grammar]], [[morphology (linguistics)|word formation]], [[vocabulary]] and [[phonology]] (sound system). 

Most new forms start off as rare and gradually become more frequent until they are established.  As most of the changes between modern and ancient Greek were introduced via Koine, Koine is largely familiar and at least partly intelligible to most writers and speakers of Modern Greek.

=== Differences in grammar ===
{{main|Koine Greek grammar}}

=== Phonology ===
{{Main|Koine Greek phonology|Ancient Greek phonology|Modern Greek phonology}}
During the period generally designated as "Koine" Greek, a great deal of phonological change occurred: at the start of the period, the pronunciation was virtually identical to [[Ancient Greek phonology]], whereas in the end it had much more in common with [[Modern Greek phonology]].

The three most significant changes were the loss of vowel length distinction, the replacement of the pitch accent system by a stress accent system, and the monophthongization of several diphthongs:
*The ancient distinction between long and short vowels was gradually lost, and from the 2nd century BC all vowels were isochronic (all vowels having equal length).<ref name=andriotes/>

*Since the 2nd century BC, the means of accenting words changed from [[Pitch accent|pitch]] to [[Stress (phonology)|stress]], meaning that the accented syllable is not pronounced in a musical tone but louder and/or stronger.<ref name=andriotes/>

*The [[Spiritus asper|aspirate breathing]] ([[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]]), which was already lost in the [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] varieties of [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]] of [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], stopped being pronounced and written in popular texts.<ref name=andriotes/>

*The <U+03B9> in the diphthongs with initial long vowels (<U+1FB1><U+0345>, <U+1FC3>, <U+1FF3>) stopped being pronounced and written in popular texts.<ref name=andriotes/>

*The diphthongs <U+03B1><U+03B9>, <U+03B5><U+03B9>, and <U+03BF><U+03B9> became single vowels. In this manner '<U+03B1><U+03B9>', which had already been converted by the Boeotians into a long <U+03B5> since the 4th century BC and written <U+03B7> (e.g. {{lang|grc|<U+03C0><U+1FC6><U+03C2>, <U+03C7><U+1FC6><U+03C1><U+03B5>, <U+03BC><U+03AD><U+03BC><U+03C6><U+03BF><U+03BC><U+03B7>}}), became in Koine, too, first a long <U+03B5> and then short. The diphthong '<U+03B5><U+03B9>' had already merged with <U+03B9> in the 5th century BC in regions such as [[Argos]] or in the 4th century BC in [[Corinth]] (e.g. {{lang|grc|<U+039B><U+0395><U+0393><U+0399><U+03A3>}}), and it acquired this pronunciation also in Koine. The diphthong '<U+03BF><U+03B9>' acquired the pronunciation of the modern [[French language|French]] 'U' ({{IPAblink|y}}), which lasted until the 10th century AD. The diphthong '<U+03C5><U+03B9>' came to be pronounced {{IPA|[yj]}}, and remained pronounced as a diphthong. The diphthong '<U+03BF><U+03C5>' had already acquired the pronunciation of [[Latin]] 'U' since the 6th century BC and preserved it in modern times.<ref name=andriotes/>

*The diphthongs <U+03B1><U+03C5> and <U+03B5><U+03C5> came to be pronounced [av] and [ev] (via [a<U+03B2>], [e<U+03B2>]), but are partly [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilated]] to [af], [ef] before the [[voiceless consonant]]s <U+03B8>, <U+03BA>, <U+03BE>, <U+03C0>, <U+03C3>, <U+03C4>, <U+03C6>, <U+03C7>, and <U+03C8>.<ref name=andriotes/>

*Simple vowels have preserved their ancient pronunciations, except <U+03B7> which is pronounced as <U+03B9>, and <U+03C5>, which retained the pronunciation {{IPA|[y]}} of modern [[French language|French]] 'U' only until the 10th century AD, and was later also pronounced as <U+03B9>. With those changes in phonology there were common spelling mistakes between <U+03C5> and <U+03BF><U+03B9>, while the sound of <U+03B9> was multiplied ([[iotacism]]).<ref name=andriotes/>

*The consonants also preserved their ancient pronunciations to a great extent, except <U+03B2>, <U+03B3>, <U+03B4>, <U+03C6>, <U+03B8>, <U+03C7> and <U+03B6>. <U+0392>, <U+0393>, <U+0394> (Beta, Gamma, Delta), which were originally pronounced {{IPA|[b, <U+0261>, d]}}, acquired the sounds of ''v, gh,'' and ''dh'' ({{IPA|[v]}} (via {{IPAblink|<U+03B2>}}), {{IPAblink|<U+0263>}}, {{IPAblink|<U+00F0>}}), which they still have today, except when preceded by a nasal consonant (<U+03BC>, <U+03BD>); in that case, they retain their ancient sounds (e.g. {{lang|grc|<U+03B3><U+03B1><U+03BC><U+03B2><U+03C1><U+03CC><U+03C2>}} {{IPA|[<U+0263>ambros]}}, {{lang|grc|<U+03AC><U+03BD><U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03C2>}} {{IPA|[andras]}}, {{lang|grc|<U+03AC><U+03B3><U+03B3><U+03B5><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03C2>}} {{IPA|[a<U+014B><U+0261>elos]}}). The latter three (<U+03A6>, <U+0398>, <U+03A7>), which were initially pronounced as [[Aspirated consonant|aspirates]] ({{IPA|/p<U+02B0>/}}, {{IPA|/t<U+02B0>/}} and {{IPA|/k<U+02B0>/}} respectively), developed into the fricatives {{IPA|[f]}} (via {{IPA|[<U+0278>]}}), {{IPA|[<U+03B8>]}}, and {{IPA|[x]}}. Finally the letter <U+0396>, which is still categorised as a double consonant with <U+03BE> and <U+03C8>, because it was initially pronounced as <U+03C3><U+03B4> (sd), later acquired the sound of Z as it appears in [[Modern English]] and [[Modern Greek|Greek]].<ref name=andriotes/>

==== New Testament Greek phonology ====

The Koine Greek in the table represents a reconstruction of New Testament Koine Greek, deriving to some degree from the dialect spoken in Judaea and Galilaea during the 1st century and similar to the dialect spoken in Alexandria, Egypt. Note the realizations of certain phonemes differ from the more standard Attic dialect of Koine. 

Note the soft fricative "<U+03B2>" in intervocalic position, the  preservation of the aspirated plosive value of "ph", "th" and "kh", the preservation of a distinction between the four front vowels "i", "<U+0113>", "e", and "y" (which is still rounded), and other features.

== Sample Koine texts ==
The following texts show differences from Attic Greek in all aspects - grammar, morphology, vocabulary and can be inferred to show differences in phonology.

The following comments illustrate the phonological development within the period of Koine. The phonetic transcriptions are tentative, and are intended to illustrate two different stages in the reconstructed development, an early conservative variety still relatively close to Classical Attic, and a somewhat later, more progressive variety approaching Modern Greek in some respects.

=== Sample 1 <U+2013> A Roman decree ===
The following excerpt, from a decree of the Roman Senate to the town of Thisbae in [[Boeotia]] in 170 BC, is rendered in a reconstructed pronunciation representing a hypothetical conservative variety of mainland Greek Koin<U+00E9> in the early Hellenistic era.<ref>G. Horrocks (1997), ''Greek: A history of the language and its speakers'', p. 87), cf. also pp. 105-109.</ref> The transcription shows partial, but not yet completed raising of <U+03B7> and <U+03B5><U+03B9>  to /i/, retention of pitch accent, fricativization of <U+03B3> to /j/ {{Clarify|date=June 2009|reason=/j/ is not a fricative, /<U+0263>/ would be, but anyway neither appear in the following IPA transcription, only   /<U+0261>/ does}} but no fricativisation of the other stops as yet, and retention of word-initial /h/ (the [[rough breathing]]).
