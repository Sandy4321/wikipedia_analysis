The Latin [[Botanical name#Binary name|specific epithet]] ''wilsonii'' refers to the 19th century botanist and explorer, [[Ernest Wilson]].<ref> Julia Brittain {{Google books| 6PBHQd-lPWYC|Horticulture - Plant Names Explained: Botanical Terms and Their Meaning|page=212}}</ref><ref name=handbook>{{cite web| first=William | last=Dykes| title=Handbook of Garden Irises | year=2009| url=http://www.beardlessiris.org/reviews/handbook%20of%20garden%20irises%20-%20dykes.pdf |format=pdf |  publisher=beardlessiris.org (The Group for Beardless Irises) | accessdate=1 November 2014}}</ref>

This plant has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]], as well as being a tentatively agreed name.<ref>{{cite web|title=Iris wilsonii |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/9405/Iris-wilsonii/Details |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref>

As Artificial floating islands (AFIs) have been used to help purify water in the restoration of the [[Bejing]] Wetlands. Several plants were studied in 2011, including soft stem bulrush (''[[Scirpus validus]]'' Vahl), spiked loosestrlfe (''[[Lythrum salicaria]]'' Linn.), yellow-flowered iris (Iris wilsonii) and dwarf cattail (''[[Typha minima]]''), to evaluate the chemical and vegetative characteristics of each type of plant.<ref name=artifical/>

In 2012, ''Lythrum salicaria'', ''[[Typha angustifolia]]'' and Iris wilsonii were studied to see which plants were ideal in removing nitrogen and phosphorus in lightly polluted urban landscape water.
All three plants grew well in the polluted water could help to remove some of the pollutants in polluted rivers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chen |first=De Qiang |last2=Liu |first2=Xiao Zhong |last3=Chen |first3=Yi Qun |last4=Maimai Ti |first4=A Bu Du Aini |last5=He |first5=Hao |date=December 2012 |title=Removal of Nitrogen and Phosphorus in Lightly Polluted Urban Landscape River by Aquatic Ornamental Plant |url=http://www.scientific.net/AMR.610-613.1943 |journal=Advanced Materials Research  |volume=610-613  |pages=1943-1949 |doi=10.4028/AMR.610-613.1943 |accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref>

In 2014, Iris wilsonii was tested with ''[[Phragmites australis]]'', ''[[Suaeda salsa]]'', ''[[Artemisia anethifolia]]'' Weber, ''[[Salicornia europaea]]'', and ''[[Spartina anglica]]'', to compare rates of the removal of high concentrations of [[chloride]] in the polluted waters of [[Tianjin City]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Shang |first=KeChun |last2=Liu |first2=XianBin |last3=Chen |first3=XiaoYing  |year=2014 |title=Screening of the salt tolerant plants for high salinity wastewater treatment by the artificial wetland |url=http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20143287371.html;jsessionid=B01918442726285264985248752392B2 |journal=Journal of Agricultural Resources and Environment  |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=74-78  |accessdate=22 December  2014}}</ref>

Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.<ref name=daves/>

==Cultivation==
The Sino-siberian irises all generally have similar cultivation requirements.

==Hybrids and Cultivars==
Most of the irises within the<U+00A0>Sibericae series, can readily hybridize with other members of the series,<ref name=botanical/> including ''Iris forrestii''.<ref name=stebbings/>
It is often used within plant breeding to produce a yellow flowers, instead of white or blue forms (common in the sibericae series).<ref name=handbook/>

Known Iris wilsonii cultivars include 'Major'
Iris wilsonii crosses include; 'Blue Wilson'; 'Cleeton Moon'; 'Cleeton Starburst'; 'Meta'; 'Zeta' <ref name=american/>
