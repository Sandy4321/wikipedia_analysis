'''Mlad<U+00E1> Vo<U+017E>ice''' is a town in the [[South Bohemian Region]] of the [[Czech Republic]] about 17&nbsp;km north-east of [[T<U+00E1>bor]]. 

==History==
[[Image:Kaple v Mlad<U+00E9> Vo<U+017E>ici.JPG|thum|left|280px|Virgin Mary Chapel built on the spot of the former castle|thumb|left|250px]]
The town originated from a settlement around a royal castle built on a hill and is known to have two [[Church (building)|churches]] as early as [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]'s period. According to local resources, the castle was erected by [[Prince]] Spytihn<U+011B>v's order to house [[silver]] from the nearby mines. One of the earliest owners of the town might have been Stanim<U+00ED>r z Vo<U+017E>ice (Ztanimirum de Bazychce), as known from a 1273 written resource. The town then belonged to several [[Dynasty|dynasties]], one of which gave the town its [[coat of arms]]: a tower set on fortification walls with two coats of arms on the sides.

Vo<U+017E>ice goods were probably owned by the royal chamber but were frequently pawned or lent to [[Feudalism|feudal lords]] for services to the [[king]]. One of the first ones was Vil<U+00E9>m of Vo<U+017E>ice who possessed the estate till 1318. From 1318 to 1425 Vo<U+017E>ice was owned by the lords of [[Land<U+0161>tejn]], Janovice, [[Orl<U+00ED>k]], [[Prague]] and Ronov houses.

In March 1420, after the [[Battle of Sudom<U+011B><U+0159>]], Vo<U+017E>ice was occupied by about 2000 [[Equestrianism|horse riders]] led by Mike<U+0161> Div<U+016F><U+010D>ek of [[:w:cs:Z<U+00E1>mek Jemni<U+0161>t<U+011B>|Jemni<U+0161>t<U+011B>]], the master of the [[Kutn<U+00E1> Hora]] mint. On [[Great Friday]] morning, 1420, [[Jan <U+017D>i<U+017E>ka]] attacked the town and set it on fire. Many lords were captured or killed and just those who had escaped to the castle got away with their lives. <U+017D>i<U+017E>ka also seized a lot of horses for his [[army]].

In September 1425 commander Jan Hv<U+011B>zda of V<U+00ED>cemilice aka Bzdinka conquered the castle after 5 weeks' besiegement, had the castle destroyed and the town was attached to [[Vla<U+0161>im]]. Mlad<U+00E1> Vo<U+017E>ice was then owned by many feudal houses, of which P<U+0159>eho<U+0159>ov<U+0161>t<U+00ED> of Kvasejovice had a chapel built on top of a hill from the castle ruins in 1646. In 1678 the estate changed owners for the K<U+00FC>enburgs, who adjoined other smaller possessions in the area and established it a hereditary estate. 

===Community life===
[[Image:Hasi<U+010D>sk<U+00E1> cisterna Tatra.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Mlad<U+00E1> Vo<U+017E>ice [[Fire apparatus|fire brigade engine]]|thumb|left]]
Long before 1848 up to the 1860s [[German language|German]] was spoken among the rich while [[Czech language|Czech]] was only spoken by the common people, who just strived to make a decent living. However, the first signs of community life in Mlad<U+00E1> Vo<U+017E>ice can be observed as early as late 18th and early 19th centuries but the highlight came after the events of 1848, which marked a breakthrough in the Czech national development. After 1860 the town's teachers and clerks, who had arrived after the school enlargement and establishment of a regional office, tax office and financial pension control,  enlivened the town. The ideals of the new national life were also brought to Mlad<U+00E1> Vo<U+017E>ice by students from their schools and cities.

In 1862 the choir ''Vlastislav'' was founded by the patriotic teacher <U+010C>e<U+0148>ek Sedm<U+00ED>k. At that time a ''Reading Club'' strived in the town but later it ceased to exist. Obviously, the national and cultural initiatives came mainly from the immigrant intelligence. For example, the local theatre club established in 1865 was run by educated people including immigrants. 

In 1875, the Voluntary [[Firefighter|Fire Brigade]] was established. It has expanded since, built a large fire brigade garage in 1945 and at present runs four large [[Fire apparatus|fire engines]]. One year later, the ''Vo<U+017E>ice Academics Club'' was founded, focusing especially on re-establishing the [[library]] after the Reading Club and performing plays.
 
The magazine ''Vo<U+017E>i<U+010D>an'' (Vo<U+017E>ice citizen) was issued in 1884 and the young generation published the hand-written magazine ''Pot<U+011B>r'' (Spawn). 1885 was marked by the founding of the gymnastics organization [[Sokol]]. Josef Joachimsthal, the steward of the K<U+00FC>enburg estate, tried hard to bring [[Rail transport|railroad]] to the town from [[T<U+00E1>bor]]. Although negotiations were held until the period of the [[Czechoslovak Republic (1918<U+2013>1938)|Czechoslovak Republic]], they failed and postal bus transport was established instead in 1921, which was taken over by the [[Czechoslovak State Railways]] in  1945 and by <U+010C>SAD company (the Czechoslovak Automibole Transport) in 1949.

===20th century===
[[Image:Z<U+00E1>mek v Mlad<U+00E9> Vo<U+017E>ici.JPG|thumb|right|270px|Z<U+00E1>mek]] 
There used to be a district court in Mlad<U+00E1> Vo<U+017E>ice, a forestry administration office,  a tax office, a gendarme office, a financial pension control, a&nbsp;[[Pharmacy|chemist]], two [[physician]]s, two [[veterinarian]]s and a [[Gelding|gelder]], a [[notary]], two [[lawyer]]s, two taxis, two [[hotel]]s, 6 [[pub]]s with three [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]], and 3 cartmen. There also was an [[almshouse]], a poor hospital, an [[orphanage]], a [[post office]] and the cinema ''Legie'' (Legion) of the Czech [[Czechoslovak Legions|Legionary]] club. There were 4 small [[savings bank]]s and representatives of 4 [[Insurance|insurance companies]]. Mlad<U+00E1> Vo<U+017E>ice held annual markets, monthly markets and [[cattle]] markets, and Thursday piglet markets.

The citizens of Mlad<U+00E1> Vo<U+017E>ice and surroundings were employed mainly on the [[count]] [[farm]], at the [[sawmill]], [[brickyard]], [[brewery]] and [[fish hatchery]], they worked on other farms in the area, local [[distillery|distilleries]] but also in the Vo<U+017E>ice [[quarry]], [[slaughterhouse]], agricultural cooperative and [[granary]], [[gristmill|mill]]s, state [[stud farm]] or were employed in the forest administration. 

After 1918 there were also two [[Service (motor vehicle)|car repair service]]s, a hosiery mill, laundry and pressing shop as well as a steam [[power plant]], which was later taken over by the company Jiho<U+010D>esk<U+00E9> elektr<U+00E1>rny (South Bohemian power plants] in Mydlovary near [[<U+010C>esk<U+00E9> Bud<U+011B>jovice]]. By 1945 there were 74 various craftsmen and 37 various shops in the town. There was also  a small furniture factory and two building companies.

Mlad<U+00E1> Vo<U+017E>ice citizens made a living by cutting wood for households, bringing water from the [[fountain]]s, and picking fruit. In the 19th and early 20th centuries they went to work to the gold mine Roudn<U+00FD>. Apart from the above mentioned jobs they found seasonal and round-the-year ones all over the republic and before around [[Austria<U+2013>Hungary]].

The town and neighbourhood of Mlad<U+00E1> Vo<U+017E>ice was a purely [[agriculture|agricultural]] area till 1945, and the change towards industrialization only began after the liberation. Until 1947 Mlad<U+00E1> Vo<U+017E>ice had been a court district in the political district of [[T<U+00E1>bor]] which occupied an area of 268 km2 and had 17422 inhabitants in 141 villages and remote settlements, associated in 39 political [[municipality|municipalities]]. It had two towns, Mlad<U+00E1> Vo<U+017E>ice and [[:cs:Mili<U+010D><U+00ED>n|Mili<U+010D><U+00ED>n]], and one township [[:cs:Kamberk|Kamberk]] (formerly [[:cs:Zlat<U+00E9> Hory|Zlat<U+00E9> Hory]], before that Kamberk). It ranked among the purest Czech regions by nationality.

Since 1949, after the change in the political and state system, Mlad<U+00E1> Vo<U+017E>ice was included in the newly established district of [[:cs:Votice|Votice]] in [[Central Bohemia|Prague region]]. After the land reorganization of 1960 Mlad<U+00E1> Vo<U+017E>ice fell under the district of [[T<U+00E1>bor]] in [[South Bohemian Region]]. In 1975-1980 small villages and [[Hamlet (place)|hamlets]] were unified with the town of Mlad<U+00E1> Vo<U+017E>ice under one national committee (i.e. town council as used between 1945-1990) but after [[Velvet Revolution|1989]] some of the villages recovered their independence.

*The  '''St. Martin church''' is situated on a reinforced terrace above the main <U+017D>i<U+017E>ka Square. All the church bells were seized in 1942 except for the passing bell; the bell called Jan was returned and blessed as late as 1952<ref name="Vyslou<U+017E>ilov<U+00E1>">Mark<U+00E9>ta Vyslou<U+017E>ilov<U+00E1>, ''Mlad<U+00E1> Vo<U+017E>ice'',  p. 33-42, Praha (2001)</ref> and three new bells, Maria, V<U+00E1>clav and Martin sounding ''Gloria'' in concord, were bought thanks to fund-raising in 1986.

*A chateau was built in the same square between 1570<U+2013>1603. It ows its present [[Baroque]] look to the [[K<U+00FC>enburgs]], who owned it for 250 years. In 1946 the chateau was confiscated and its interiors were used by the [[Koh-I-Noor (company)|Koh-i-Noor]] factory<ref name="Vyslou<U+017E>ilov<U+00E1>"/>. At present the building is closed to the public and its condition is poor, owing mainly to unsuccessful restitutions.

*The Assumption of the Virgin Chapel is situated on top of a hill above the town where the royal castle used to stand. It was built by Kri<U+0161>tof Karel P<U+0159>eho<U+0159>ovsk<U+00FD> z Kvasejovic<ref name="Vyslou<U+017E>ilov<U+00E1>"/>, the owner of the Vo<U+017E>ice estate, in 1646.

*The ruin of the castle [[:cs:<U+0160>elmberk|<U+0160>elmberk]] can be found about 2&nbsp;km north-east of the town. Unfortunately, just the round [[keep]] has been preserved till the present day. It is freely accessible except for the tower, which was made into a museum and [[observation tower]] and can be visited in the opening hours.
