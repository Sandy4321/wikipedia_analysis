==Background==
{{further|Nik Wallenda}}

[[Nik Wallenda]] is American [[Tightrope walking#Styles_of_tightrope_acts|highwire]] artist and member of the famed [[Flying Wallendas]] circus family.  He has been walking the wire since age two and now holds seven world records.  In 2008, he set the record for highest and longest bicycle ride across a tightrope.  In 2012, he became the first person to successfully tightrope walk directly over Niagara Falls.  The feat aired live on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] who, much to the dismay of Wallenda, decided at the last minute that he would have to wear a safety harness for the event.<ref name=Telegraph />

The [[Grand Canyon]] area has played host to a number of high-profile stunts and daredevil feats.  In 1922, Royal Thomas flew a [[Lincoln Standard L.S.5|Lincoln Stanard]] biplane into Grand Canyon National Park, landing just {{convert|50|ft|m}} from the Canyon's edge.  The park did not yet have stunting regulations and the feat was approved by park superintendent Walter Crosby.  In 1980, stuntman [[Dar Robinson]] drove a sportscar over the canyon's edge, parachuting out of the car as it fell.  He did the stunt in [[Hualapai Indian Reservation]] after being denied a permit by the National Park.  In 1999, daredevil [[Robbie Knievel]] jumped a narrow {{convert|228|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} portion of canyon in Hualapai territory on a [[motorcycle]], breaking his own world record for longest jump in the process.  The event aired live on [[Fox News]].  In 2006, [[Bob Burnquist]] skateboarded off a ramp into the canyon, descending to the bottom with a parachute.  In 2011, [[Yves Rossy|Yves "Jetman" Rossy]] used a custom made jet suit to glide above the Hualapai reservation for eight minutes.  He covered a distance of {{convert|5|mi|km}} before parachuting into the canyon.<ref name=NatGeo>{{cite news|title=Grand Canyon Stunts Over the Years|author=Harmony Huskinson|work=National Georgaphic|date=June 21, 2013|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/06/130622-grand-canyon-stunts-wallenda/|accessdate=July 6, 2013}}</ref>

On March 18, 2013, Wallenda announced that he had come to terms with The [[Discovery Channel]] for television rights.<ref name=DailyMail>{{cite news|title=Tightrope daredevil Nik Wallenda will cross the Grand Canyon without a safety harness live on television|date=March 18, 2013|work=Daily Mail|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2295297/Tightrope-daredevil-Nik-Wallenda-set-cross-Grand-Canyon-harness-live-television.html|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref>  ABC also bid for the walk, but was concerned about the show being repetitive with the Niagara walk and was not prepared to pay as much as Discovery.<ref name=wins_bid>{{cite news|title=Discovery Wins Bid to Televise Canyon Crossing|author=Brain Stelter|date=March 18, 2013|work=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/business/media/discovery-wins-bid-to-televise-canyon-crossing.html|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref>  Additionally, Discovery emphasized its international footprint and promised Wallenda that he would not have to wear a safety device.<ref name=wins_bid /> After he came to terms with Discovery, both Wallenda and his network partners had to finalize permits with the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]].  According to a tribal spokesperson, the decision to allow the walk was not taken lightly.  The process included archaeological, biological, and environmental impact studies.<ref name=Forbes />

According to Wallenda, "There's a lot of updrafts and downdrafts, and the winds are hard to predict [in the Canyon]".<ref name=DailyMail /> The air temperature during the walk was expected to exceed {{convert|90|F|C}}, with the steel cable hitting {{convert|100|to|110|F|C}}.<ref name=GC_attempts />  To prepare, Wallenda walked a {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} wire twice daily along the banks of a Sarasota river with fans watching.<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite news|title=Nik Wallenda: The man crossing the Grand Canyon on a tightrope|work=The Telegraph|date=June 20, 2013|author=Jane Mulkerrins|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/10132372/Nik-Wallenda-The-man-crossing-the-Grand-Canyon-on-a-tightrope.html|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref><ref name=gorge />  He practiced with wind machines to simulate wind gusts up to {{convert|91|mph|kph}}.

On June 19, Discovery aired a special episode of ''[[MythBusters]]'' titled "Duct Tape Canyon" to coincide with Wallenda's walk.  On the episode, Wallenda appears to the show's team as a hallucination as they attempt to survive in the desert using only [[duct tape]].<ref>{{cite news|title='MythBusters': Duct Tape And Desert Hallucinations Of Nik Wallenda|work=Huffington Post|author=Maggie Furlong|date=June 19, 2013|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/19/mythbusters-exclusive-duct-tape-canyon_n_3462565.html|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref>

On June 23, 2013, Wallenda highwire walked across the [[Little Colorado River]] Gorge in the Navajo Tribal Park.<ref name=Forbes />  The location was outside [[Grand Canyon National Park]]'s borders, about 40 miles east of the main tourist facilities.<ref name=gorge /><ref name=CSM />   In its official press release, Discovery previewed the feat "Nik Wallenda&nbsp;... will traverse the majestic Grand Canyon".<ref name=PR>{{cite press release|title=Tightrope Legend Nik Wallenda to Cross over Grand Canyon, His Highest Walk Ever|publisher=Discovery Communications|date=March 18, 2013|url=http://press.discovery.com/us/dsc/press-releases/2013/tightrope-legend-nik-wallenda-cross-over-gran-2376/|accessdate=July 3, 2013}}</ref>  Other interpretations of whether or not the location was part of the Grand Canyon varied.

Before the walk started, Wallenda and his family prayed with [[evangelism|evangelist]] and family friend [[Joel Osteen]].<ref name=glory>{{cite news|title=Nik Wallenda walks tightrope near Grand Canyon <U+2018>for the glory of God<U+2019>|author=Elizabeth Tenety|date=June 24, 2013|work=Washington Post|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-faith/wp/2013/06/24/nik-wallenda-walks-tightrope-near-grand-canyon-for-the-glory-of-god/|accessdate=July 2, 2013}}</ref>  He was then helicoptered to an island in the middle of the canyon to start his journey.<ref name=Fogle /> To limit environmental impact, the event was not open to the public.<ref name=Forbes /> Members of the press were required to sign a waiver saying they would not sue for [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] in the event that Wallenda fell. An armed security guard was positioned at the bottom of the canyon to protect his body from animals.<ref name=Fogle>{{cite news|title=Ben Fogle's country travels: Nik Wallenda is my new hero|author=Ben Fogle|date=July 2, 2013|work=The Telegraph|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/outdoors/outdoor-activities/10153053/Ben-Fogles-country-travels-Nik-Wallenda-is-my-new-hero.html|accessdate=July 2, 2013}}</ref>

As the walk began at 7:38pm [[Mountain Daylight Time|MDT]], Wallenda realized the wire had become slippery due to gathered dust.<ref name=Reuters_GC /><ref name=LAT_ratings /> He spat on his hands and rubbed his shoes for better grip. Shortly thereafter, he stopped and crouched down on the wire due to wind gusts. He later stopped a second time to break the bounce of the wire that his walking had induced.<ref name=Reuters_GC /> Throughout the walk, Wallenda could be heard praying, repeatedly saying "Help me to relax, Lord", "God, you<U+2019>re so good. Thank you for this opportunity, Lord", and "Thank you, Jesus."<ref name=glory /> Midway through he said "Thank you Lord. Thank you for calming that cable, God".<ref name=AP_GC /> Wallenda ran the last few steps then jumped off and kissed the ground.<ref name=AP_GC /><ref name=Reuters_GC />  Completing the walk in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, Wallenda became the first person to highwire walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge.<ref name=Reuters_GC />

At {{convert|1500|ft|m}}, the walk was the highest of Wallenda's career, about seven times as high as the Niagara crossing.<ref name=CSM>{{cite news|title=Daredevil Wallenda to take on Grand Canyon <U+2013> without a safety net|author=Mark Guarino|date=June 23, 2013|work=The Christian Science Monitor|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2013/0623/Daredevil-Wallenda-to-take-on-Grand-Canyon-without-a-safety-net|accessdate=June 23, 2013}}</ref> He covered a distance of approximately {{convert|1400|ft|m}} in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, using a {{convert|2|in|cm|adj=on|thick}} wire.<ref name=Telegraph /><ref name=CSM /> He carried a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on|long}} balancing pole weighing {{convert|43|lb|kg}}.<ref name=GC_attempts /> Wallenda said it was important for him to vary his pace throughout the walk to prevent [[resonance]] effects.

Commenting on the walk, a Navajo spokesman said, "We are honored to be a part of this historic event and showcase the beauty that exists on Navajo country," and said he expected the event to boost tourism.<ref name=CSM /> Tribal president [[Ben Shelly]] said he was grateful for the publicity. "It<U+2019>s exposing what a beautiful land we have", he said. "Another nation exists, and it's the Navajo Nation."<ref name=CSM /> However, a group of Navajo and other Native Americans protested the event saying the tribe should not be promoting the risking of human life to promote tourism.<ref name=AP_GC /> The Navajos did not charge for the use of the site, but Discovery did pay for the paving of a new road and parking lot to accommodate spectators.<ref name=CSM />

After the walk, Wallenda said it was more difficult than he had expected and that "it took every bit of me to stay focused".<ref name=Reuters_GC />  He said that dust had accumulated in his contact lenses and called the walk unusually stressful.<ref name=AP_GC /><ref name=Reuters_GC /> Additionally, he said an "optical illusion" made it hard to concentrate.<ref name=glory /> However, he called the view breathtaking, and said the opportunity "was a dream come true."<ref name=Reuters_GC />
