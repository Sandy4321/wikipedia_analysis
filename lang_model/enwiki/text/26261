'''George Franklin Barber''' (July 31, 1854 &ndash; February 17, 1915) was an American architect best known for his residential designs, which he marketed worldwide through a series of mail-order catalogs.  One of the most successful domestic architects of the late [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] period in the United States,<ref name=tomlan1>Michael Tomlan, Introduction to George F. Barber's ''Victorian Cottage Architecture: An American Catalog of Designs, 1891'' (Dover Publications, 2004), pp. v-xvi.</ref>  Barber's plans were used for houses in all 50 U.S. states, and in nations as far away as Japan and the Philippines.<ref name=tomlan1 />  Over four dozen Barber houses are individually listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and several dozen more are listed as part of historic districts.<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|version=2009a}}</ref>

Barber began designing houses in his native [[DeKalb, Illinois]], in the late 1880s, before permanently moving his base to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], in 1888.  His first widely-circulated catalog, ''Cottage Souvenir No. 2'', contained designs and floor plans for fifty-nine houses, mostly in the [[Queen Anne architecture|Queen Anne style]], as well as Barber's architectural philosophy and tips for homebuilders.  Later catalogs contained more [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial]] designs.<ref name=tomlan1 />  By the time his catalog business ended in 1908, Barber had sold upwards of 20,000 plans.<ref name=tomlan1 />

Barber was the father of [[Charles I. Barber]] (1887&ndash;1962), who went on to become a successful architect in his own right, and designed a number of notable buildings in the Knoxville area during the first half of the 20th century.<ref name=tomlan1 />  [[BarberMcMurry]], an architectural firm cofounded by Charles Barber in 1915, still operates in Knoxville.<ref name=bma>[http://www.bma1915.com/company/history.html BarberMcMurry - History].

===Early life and career===
[[File:Charles-bradt-house-gb1.jpg|right|thumb|195px|The Charles E. Bradt House, one of Barber's first designs]]

Barber was born in [[DeKalb, Illinois]], in 1854, the son of Lyman and Cornelia Barrett Barber.<ref name=little /> While still a young child, he moved to Marmaton, Kansas, where he lived on the farm of his sister, Olive, and her husband, William Barrett.<ref name=tomlan1 />  By the 1870s, he owned an adjacent farm, where he raised plants which he advertised as "ornamental nursery stock."<ref name=tomlan1 />  During this period, he learned architecture through mail-order books, namely George Palliser's ''American Cottage Homes'' and technical books published by A.J. Bicknell and Company.<ref name=little>M. Ruth Little (2009). [http://ncarchitects.lib.ncsu.edu/people/P000234 Barber, George F. (1854-1915)], North Carolina Architects and Builders, A Biographical Dictionary. Website maintained by North Carolina State University Libraries. Accessed May 3, 2011.</ref>  In 1884, Barber patented a nail-holding attachment for hammers.<ref name=tomlan1 />

By the mid 1880s, Barber was back in DeKalb, where he produced his first architectural designs working for his brother's construction firm, Barber and Boardman, Contractors and Builders.<ref name=little />  In 1887 or early 1888, Barber published ''The Cottage Souvenir'', crudely produced on punched card stock and tied together with a piece of yarn, which contained 14 house plans (a revised edition published shortly afterward contained 18).<ref name=tomlan1 /><ref name=TNencBM>[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=B006 Barber & McMurry Architects], ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture'', accessed July 18, 2010</ref>  The earliest buildings constructed from Barber's designs include the Charles E. Bradt House (1887) and the Congregational Church (1888), both in DeKalb.<ref name=tomlan1 />  The Bradt house was featured in the March 1888 issue of ''Carpentry and Building''.<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=G3fmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA50&dq=charles+bradt+barber+dekalb+illinois&hl=en&ei=GKy0TcK3O8-WtwejrP3pDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Carpentry and Building]'', Vol. 10 (March 1888), p. 50.

In late 1888, Barber relocated to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], in hopes that the city's mountainous climate would be better for his declining health.<ref name=tomlan1 />  He briefly partnered with [[Minnesota]]-born architect Martin Parmalee, but the partnership proved unsatisfactory.<ref name=tomlan1 />  In 1892, he established a firm with one of his clients, J.C. White, handling the firm's business aspects.<ref name=tomlan1 /> Barber also became a partner in the Edgewood Land Improvement Company, which was developing a suburb east of Knoxville known as Park City (modern [[Parkridge (Knoxville, Tennessee)|Parkridge]]).<ref name=tomlan1 /><ref name=pchd>Ann Bennett, National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form for Park City Historic District, 22 June 1990.</ref>  He designed over a dozen houses for this suburb, including his own house, which still stands at 1635 Washington Avenue, and the W.O. Haworth and F.E. McArthur houses, which also still stand on Washington Avenue, and appeared in some of Barber's catalogs.<ref name=knoxtour>Knox Heritage, [http://www.knoxheritage.org/sites/default/files/KH%20George%20Barber%20Homes%20Tour_web.pdf George Barber Homes Trolley Tour Booklet], 2007.  Retrieved: 1 May 2011.</ref>  

In 1890, Barber published ''The Cottage Souvenir No. 2'', which contained 59 house plans, as well as plans for 2 barns, a chapel, a church, 2 storefronts, and several pavilions.<ref name=tomlan1 />  This catalog and its subsequent revisions led to an explosion in orders for Barber's firm.  Barber houses built during this period include the Jeremiah Nunan House in [[Jacksonville, Oregon]],<ref name=nunan>Marion Ross and Christopher Owens, [http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/OR0072/ Historic American Buildings Survey for Jeremiah Nunan House], 1971.

Hawkins Hart House], 1 October 2010.  Retrieved: 1 May 2011.</ref> all of which still stand and are listed on the National Register.  He also remained active on a local level in Knoxville, with the Romanesque-inspired [[Isaac Ziegler House]] on 4th Avenue,<ref name=ziegler>Joseph Herndon, [http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/TN0093/ Historic American Buildings Survey for Isaac Ziegler House], 1974.  Retrieved: 1 May 2011.</ref> and a house built for his printer, S.B. Newman, which still stands in [[Old North Knoxville]].<ref name=knoxtour />  

Around 1895, Barber parted ways with White and formed a new firm with a new partner, Thomas Kluttz.<ref name=little />  That year, Barber began publishing a magazine, ''American Homes'', which advertised the firm's latest house plans, offered tips on landscaping and interior design, and published a multi-part history of architecture by [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] architect Charles Hite-Smith.<ref name=tomlan1 />  In 1896, the growing firm moved into the Barber-designed French and Roberts Building on [[Gay Street (Knoxville)|Gay Street]], with the firm's thirty draftsmen and twenty secretaries occupying an entire floor.<ref name=tomlan1 />

===Later career===

In the late 1890s and early 1900s, Barber designed a number of elaborate mansions for affluent businessmen, including the home of Carroll Lathrop Post (brother of [[C. W. Post]]) in [[Battle Creek, Michigan]],<ref name=tomlan1 /> the home of tobacco magnate [[R. J. Reynolds]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]],<ref name=little />  the home of People's Bank president N.E. Graham in [[East Brady, Pennsylvania]],<ref name=tomlan1 /> and one of his grandest designs, the $40,000 "Mount Athos" for [[Barboursville, Virginia]], tycoon Walter G. Newman.<ref>Jeff O'Dell, John Salmon, and Randolph Turner, [http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Orange/068-0304_Madison-Barbour_Rural_Historic_District_1989_Final_Nomination.pdf National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form for Madison-Barbour Rural Historic District], December 1989, Section 7, pp. 33-34.  Retrieved: 3 May 2011.</ref>  

In the early 1900s, Barber began to phase out his mail-order business and with the help of his brother, Manley, focused on Knoxville-area building projects.<ref name=little />  He later worked with architects [[R. F. Graf]] and John Ryno.<ref name=pchd /><ref>Ann Bennett, National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form for Stratford, 23 March 2009.</ref>  The publication of ''American Homes'' was moved to New York in 1902, though Barber remained a regular contributor for several years afterward.<ref name=tomlan1 />  The catalog business was suspended in 1908.<ref name=tomlan1 />  Barber died on February 17, 1915, and is interred with his family in Knoxville's Greenwood Cemetery.<ref name=findagrave>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln=barber&GSfn=george+&GSmn=franklin&GSby=1854&GSbyrel=in&GSdyrel=in&GSob=n&GRid=65088536&df=all& George Franklin Barber at Findagrave.com].

The bulk of Barber's business followed the "catalog architecture" model popularized by earlier architects such as Palliser.  Barber's great innovation was his willingness to personalize his designs for individual clients at moderate cost.<ref name=tomlan1 />  As he wrote in his ''Cottage Souvenir No. 2'', "Write to us concerning any changes wanted in plans, and keep writing till you get what you want.  Don't be afraid of writing too often.  We are not easily offended."<ref name=tomlan1 />  Though his firms' records no longer survive, it is believed that he sold as many as 20,000 plans in his career.<ref name=tomlan1 />  Since he frequently modified his designs to fit his clients' needs and specifications, his houses are sometimes difficult to attribute with any certainty.<ref>Ann Bennett, [http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/64500608.pdf Historic and Architectural Resources in Knoxville and Knox County, Tennessee], May 1994, Sec. 7, p. 51.  Retrieved: 2 May 2011.</ref>

In discussing his architectural philosophy, Barber argued that Nature has "faithfully and accurately adhered to the Divine law of harmony,"<ref name=barber1>George F. Barber, ''Victorian Cottage Architecture: An American Catalog of Designs'' (Dover Publications, 2004), pp. 3-7.</ref> and that no place should adhere more closely to the fundamental principles of nature than one's house.<ref name=barber1 />  Barber considered [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]] the most important element in architecture, likening it to [[harmony]] in music, "without which all else is a failure."<ref name=barber1 />  He described ornamentation as the next most important element, as it gives proportion expression.  Lastly was "harmony of form," or the relationship of curved and straight lines to one another.<ref name=barber1 /> 

[[File:RL Covington House.jpg|left|210px|thumb|The Robert Covington House in [[Hazlehurst, Mississippi]], one of Barber's later designs]]

Barber's early designs were modified versions of the Queen Anne style, which Barber liked to enrich with the addition of [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque]] elements.<ref name=tomlan1 />  Barber houses constructed in this period are characterized by features such imposing [[turret]]s, projecting windows, [[veranda]]s flanked by circular pavilions, and Syrian arches.<ref name=tomlan1 />  In the latter half of the 1890s, Barber began to offer more plans in the [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] style.<ref name=tomlan1 />  These were often characterized by projecting [[portico]]s supported by large columns, symmetrical facades, and flat decks with balustrades. Later Barber catalogs contained [[Bungalow]] and [[American Craftsman|Craftsman]] styles, though few of these were built.<ref name=tomlan1 />

Some have suggested that Barber was the first to sell prefabricated houses in crates, but there is no evidence that he was actually engaged in manufacturing.<ref name=tomlan1 />  While he occasionally suppled builders with  manufactured windows, doors, staircases and other components, and that a number of millwork companies advertised in Barber's magazine, it is unclear whether entire houses were sold as kits by anyone prior to 1900.<ref name=tomlan1 />

===Barber houses today===
[[File:John-owings-house-sc1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|The John Owings House in Laurens, South Carolina]]
A revived interest in Barber's work began in the 1970s,<ref name=tomlan1 /> and since then, hundreds of houses built using his plans have been identified.  Over four dozen of these have been individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places for their architecture, and several dozen more have been listed as contributing properties in historic districts.<ref name=nris/>  At least four Barber houses&mdash; the Isaac Ziegler House, the Jeremiah Nunan House, the John Owings House ([[Laurens, South Carolina]]), and Roselawn ([[Natchitoches, Louisiana]])&mdash; have been documented by the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]].<ref name=nunan /><ref name=ziegler /><ref>Nancy Pittenger and Tracy Power, [http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/SC0750/ Historic American Buildings Survey - John Calvin Owings House], 1988.

Retrieved: 1 May 2011.</ref>

Many extant Barber houses are still used as residences, while others house museums, [[bed and breakfasts]], and office space.  Barber houses have provided inspiration for Christmas cards, wall hangings, and at least one dollhouse model.<ref name=tomlan1 />  While most of Barber's work was domestic, several notable non-domestic Barber-designed buildings survive.  These include the Congregational Church (now DeKalb Foursquare Church) in DeKalb, Illinois,<ref name=tomlan1 /> the Raper Building in [[Lexington, North Carolina]],<ref>Uptown Lexington, Inc., [http://www.uptownlexington.com/trails/heritagewalk.pdf Historic Uptown Lexington, North Carolina - A Heritage Tour].
