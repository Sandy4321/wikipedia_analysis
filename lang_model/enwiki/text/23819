The '''2000 Sri Lanka Cyclone''', (IMD designation: '''BOB&nbsp;06''' JTWC designation:'''04B'''), was the strongest [[tropical cyclone]] to strike [[Sri Lanka]] since 1978. The fourth tropical storm and the second severe cyclonic storm of the [[2000 North Indian Ocean cyclone season]], it developed from an area of disturbed weather on December 25, 2000. It moved westward, and quickly strengthened under favorable conditions to reach top wind speeds of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h). The cyclone hit eastern [[Sri Lanka]] at peak strength, then weakened slightly while crossing the island before hitting and dissipating over [[southern India]] on December 28.

The storm was the first cyclone over Sri Lanka with winds of at least hurricane strength since a 110&nbsp;mph (175&nbsp;km/h) cyclone hit in the [[Pre-1980 North Indian Ocean cyclone seasons|1978 season]], as well as the first tropical storm to hit the island since 1992. The storm was also the first December tropical cyclone of hurricane intensity in the [[Bay of Bengal]] since [[1995-1999 North Indian Ocean cyclone seasons|1996]]. It produced heavy rainfall and strong winds, damaging or destroying tens of thousands of houses and leaving up to 500,000 homeless. At least nine people died as a result of the cyclone.<ref name="wsws"/>

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Cyclone 04B 2000 track.png}}
An area of [[atmospheric convection]] developed and persisted on December 21 in the central [[Bay of Bengal]]<ref name="gp"/> forming within an active near-equatorial [[trough (meteorology)|trough]].<ref name="wmo"/> Located within an area of weak vertical [[wind shear]], the system steadily organized, and after initially remaining nearly stationary it began to move slowly westward. Deep convection continued to develop, and on December 23 a mid-level circulation began to form. Later that day, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) issued a [[Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert]]. By the night of the December 23, a low-level circulation developed in the system, located to the south of the deep convection. The disturbance continued to organize,<ref name="gp"/> with the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD) classifying it as a deep depression early on December 24.<ref name="wmo"/> Later that day, the organization of the system degraded slightly, though it quickly reorganized. On December 25, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 04B while it was located about 155&nbsp;miles (250&nbsp;km) east of [[Sri Lanka]]. On the center's first advisory, the tropical storm was drifting west-northwest at 3&nbsp;mph (5&nbsp;km/h) with maximum sustained winds of 45&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="gp">{{cite web|author=Gary Padgett|year=2001|title=December 2000 Global Tropical Cyclone Summary|accessdate=2007-01-04|url=http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2001/summ0012.htm}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, the IMD upgraded the deep depression to a cyclonic storm as a [[eye (cyclone)|central dense overcast]] developed over the center.<ref name="wmo"/>

A [[subtropical ridge]] to the north of the cyclone resulted in it continuing generally westward. Deep convection continued to develop over the center of circulation, and the storm steadily strengthened as [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] improved throughout the circulation.<!--explanation or link for non-hurricane buffs?--> By late on December 25, a [[rainband]] wrapped tightly into the center,<ref name="gp"/> and it intensified into a severe cyclonic storm as it approached the coast of Sri Lanka.<ref name="wmo"/> The next day the cyclone developed an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] as it turned west-southwestward. On December 26, the cyclone made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on near [[Trincomalee]], Sri Lanka. The JTWC assessed the cyclone as attaining peak winds of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="gp"/> However, the IMD estimated the cyclone reached a maximum intensity of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h), making it a very severe cyclonic storm.<ref name="wmo"/> It weakened slightly over land and emerged into the [[Gulf of Mannar]] early on December 27 as a tropical storm. Initially, forecasters predicted it to slowly re-intensify; instead it weakened as its convection degraded in organization and intensity. After turning west-northwestward, the storm struck southern India near [[Kanyakumari district|Kanyakumari]] on December 28 with winds of 45&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;km/h), with minimal convection due to land interaction and increased [[wind shear]].<ref name="gp"/> It rapidly weakened to tropical depression status over land, and its remnants degenerated into a low pressure area after emerging into the eastern [[Arabian Sea]] early on December 29.<ref name="wmo">{{cite web|author=India Meteorological Department|year=2001|title=Summary for Tropical Cyclones in the RSMC New Delhi Area of Responsibility|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=2008-05-25|url=http://ftp.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/pdf/TD1082-TCseason2000.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

Government officials in Sri Lanka issued a last-minute evacuation order for potentially affected areas, though few received the evacuation order. The cyclone hit the eastern and western coastlines with powerful waves, wrecking 25&nbsp;fishing boats in eastern coastal towns and washing away 109 boats near [[Puttalam]].

==Aftermath==

Sri Lanka governmental aid was slow at first, with the media criticizing the government for its initial response. A street protest occurred in [[Trincomalee]] due to lack of aid.<ref name="wsws"/> [[Prime Minister]] [[Ratnasiri Wickremanayake]] organized a meeting of government officials to propose an increase in relief funds. A family of five or more received $5.50 a week (2000&nbsp;USD, (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|5.50|2000|r=2}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD), 500 in 2000&nbsp;[[Sri Lankan rupee|LKR]]) for dry rations, while the families of those who died received $183 (2000&nbsp;USD, (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|183|2000|r=2}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD, {{Formatprice|15000}} 2000&nbsp;LKR) in compensation. The government also gave $122 (2000&nbsp;USD, (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|122|2000|r=2}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD, {{Formatprice|10000}} 2000&nbsp;LKR) to those whose houses were damaged or destroyed,<ref name="wsws"/> and delivered rice rations to those stranded, while state-organized radio broadcasts appealed for donations.<ref name="rw"/>

Within two days of the cyclone striking, the Sri Lankan [[Red Cross]] began an operation with 4,000&nbsp;volunteers to help those most badly affected. The [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] issued a preliminary appeal for $323,000 (2000&nbsp;USD, (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|378000|2000|r=2}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD, ${{Formatprice|525000}} in 2000&nbsp;[[Swiss franc|CHF]]) to assist about 10,000&nbsp;people by making blankets, shelter, food, and kitchen utensils available. To kick-start the operation, the Federation released about $61,000 (2000&nbsp;USD, (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|61000|2000|r=2}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD, ${{Formatprice|100000}} in 2000&nbsp;CHF) within a few hours of the cyclone making landfall.<ref name="rw"/> After about a month, the Red Cross distributed 10 roofing sheets each to 1,720 families, and also sent a set of cooking utensils, bed sheets, and sleeping mats to 3,000&nbsp;families.<ref name="ifrc">{{cite web|author=International Federation of the Red Cross|year=2001|title=Sri Lanka: Cyclone Preliminary Appeal No. 36/00 Situation Report No. 1|publisher=[[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|ReliefWeb]]|accessdate=2007-10-25|url=http://reliefweb.int/w/rwb.nsf/480fa8736b88bbc3c12564f6004c8ad5/56ec3fdad9e3afb7c12569fc004b940a?OpenDocument}}</ref> Relief ended on November 7, 2001, roughly 40&nbsp;weeks after the cyclone struck.<ref name="final">{{cite web|author=International Federation of the Red Cross|year=2001|title=Sri Lanka: Cyclone appeal No. 36/00 final report|accessdate=2007-10-25|url=http://reliefweb.int/w/rwb.nsf/480fa8736b88bbc3c12564f6004c8ad5/e55a3480fec9b72dc1256b02004dff1d?OpenDocument}}</ref>
