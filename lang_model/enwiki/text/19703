=== Compilation Work in Persian Language ===
<!-- Commented out: [[File: Ghalib-Farsi-Kalam-Iran.jpg|300px|thumb |left|<small>Picture of ceremonial function for release of [[Ghalib]]<U+2019>s Persian Poetry Kulliyat-e-Ghalib Farsi sponsored by Iranian Ministry of Arts and Culture in [[Tehran]] - September, 2010.]] --></small>
Two volumes of [[Mirza Ghalib]]'s [[Persian poetry]] Kuliyat-e-Ghalib Farsi were released by Shiv Raman Gaud. Earlier Dr Shahid Mahauli, Director of Ghalib institute in Delhi, Dr SK Taneja and Padmashri Dr KL Zakir shared their views..<ref name="tribuneindia1">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20100324/ttlife1.htm |title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - The Tribune Lifestyle |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-31}}</ref>. Kulliyat-e-Ghalib Farsi, an anthology of Persian poetry of well-known Urdu poet Mirza Asadullal Khan Ghalib was released at [[Maulana Azad National Urdu University]] (MANUU).  Speaking at the occasion, Dr. Abedi said study of Ghalib would be incomplete without his [[Persian poetry]]. <U+201C>Although Ghalib had earned his reputation in [[Urdu Literature]], the  poet of  [[Mughal era]] was more inclined towards Persian and produced high-order poetry in that language<U+201D>  <ref name="tribuneindia1"/>

Ambassadors of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] jointly released Dr Taqi Abedi<U+2019>s well-researched, compiled and published book Kulliyat-e-Ghalib Farsi at a function sponsored by Iranian [[Ministry]] of Arts and Culture in [[Tehran]] on 20 September, 2010. Chairman of Tehran<U+2019>s famous Publishing House, Dr Ameeri has published this book in large number. The book also contains a Foreward by Abedi in Urdu. Two books written by Iran<U+2019>s present expert on [[Ghalib]]<U+2019>s [[Persian poetry]] Muhammad Hasan Haairi have already been published in this country. Speaking on this occasion Dr Taqi Abedi said that with the publication of this book here (in Iran) avenues for popularization and familiarization of Ghalib<U+2019>s poetry in Persian language among the people of [[Iran]] have been paved and people in larger number will be able to read Ghalib<U+2019>s poetry composed by him in Persian language. It may be incidentally mentioned in this connection that Ghalib<U+2019>s [[couplets]] in Persian are in far greater number than in [[Urdu]] which are almost unknown in both [[India]] as well as in [[Pakistan]]. <ref>{{cite web|author=The Milli Gazette |url=http://www.milligazette.com/news/8283-dr-taqi-aabdis-kulliyat-e-ghalib-faarsi-released-in-tehran |title=Dr Taqi Aabdi<U+2019>s Kulliyat-e-Ghalib Faarsi released in Tehran |publisher=Milligazette.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-31}}</ref>.  Besides, He has also compiled Persian poetry by [[Mirza Dabeer]] and Mir [[Anis]].

=== Work on Hindu religion Poets ===
With laborious research, he has the credit of compiling admirable poetic praise by Hindu religion followers Poets as devotees of [[Prophet Muhammad]] and his progeny ( [[Ahl al-Bayt]] ) which may be seen at Dr. Taqi Abedi<U+2019>s official website available in a compiled leaflet as a selected Naats, Marsias, Soaz and Salams by 40 Hindu poets, such as Gopi Nath Aman, Kalidas Gupta Raza and Dalloo Ram Kausari.
In his researched based compilation <U+201C>Roop Kunwar Kumari<U+201D> of female Urdu Poet of Hindu faith and devotee of Ahle-ul-Bayt, published in Multan, Pakistan, presented biographic and poetic details and undiscovered facts about this female poet; Dr. Abedi made it clear that this poet was female and not male, as most of the critiques were confused about the gender of poet.  This anthology is a mini encyclopedia on this female Hindu poet of Urdu Language, highlighting her Marsias because of her expression being steeped in the cultural tradition she had inherited from her faith. She<ref> http://www.dawn.com/news/827152/column-lament-for-a-marsiya-writer </ref> <ref> http://watandost.blogspot.com/2008_12_14_archive.html</ref>  had devised for herself a mode of expression wherein Hindised Bhakti terminology and Persianised expressions of [[Marsia]]'s are seen blending together in a sound way. This blending of the two modes of expression imparts a new flavour to the Marsia and for this reason she stands distinguished among her contemporary writers.
Here are some couplets which speak of her unique style:
{{Cquote|
:::

===== Ali's feet shelter all  ! Ali's loved by the two souls =====
:::

===== No one knows Ali's reality  ! But the Prophet and God Almighty =====
}}

=== Research and compilation on Mir Anis and Mirza Dabeer ===
<U+201C>Kulliyat-e-Anees<U+201D> the book contains 579  [[Rubias]] of the famous Urdu poet [[Mir Anis]] spread over 500 pages. The preface of this book written by Dr. Taqi Abedi spreads over 150 pages. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siasat.com/english/news/dr-taqi-abedi%E2%80%99s-book-release-function-today |title=Dr. Taqi Abedi<U+00E2><U+20AC><U+2122>s book release function today |publisher=Siasat |date= |accessdate=2014-07-31}}</ref>.  He has also published his researched compilation <U+201C>Tajzia-e-Yadgar Marsia:  <ref> Source: Book Review <U+2013> Volume 3 No.6 New Hope Pages 90-91, Issue November-December, 2002 </ref> Besides, the poetry of Mir Anis, Dr. Abedi has also tried to trace the minute details of the life of Anis like his appearance, costume, punctuality, sensitivity, behavior and habits, first and last <U+201C>Majlis<U+201D> (sermons), prayers, illness and death.
[[File: Mir Anis and Mirza Dabeer Competition.jpg|550px|thumb|Center| <small>It pertains to Mujtahid Nazm Mirza Debeer (a poem by [[Dabeer]]) compiled by Dr. Abedi & complimented to Late religious cleric</small>]]
While attended a seminar as an speaker  in  [[Karachi]] Dr. Taqi with reference to  his latest publication on Mirza Dabeer, a collection of the poet's salaams and [[Rubais]] <U+201C>Rubayat-e-Dabeer<U+201D> expressed a notable view:<ref> Source: Feb 25, 2004 - Dawn Features by By Maqbool Ahmad Bhatty - http://www.dawn.com/news/1065655 </ref>
Comparison between the two in literary circles of Mir Anis and Mirza Dabeer is not new. It began perhaps with the publication of <U+201C>Mawazna-i-Anees-o-Dabeer<U+201D>  by [[Shibli Nomani]] around a century back. Leaving aside the issue for a while, let me recall that there was another side of the Mawazna.
:*Mir Anees was born in the year 1802 and died 72 years later in 1874. Mirza Dabeer was born in 1803, a year later than Anees, and died in 1875, also at the age of 72. This chronological closeness is amazing.
:*To return to the comparison theme, two masters had much respect for each other. With their literary and cultural sophistications, they were never disrespectful to one another.
:*But the [[Lucknow]] of those years - a seat of [[culture]] but with an ornate lifestyle and mannerisms - had its meaner side also. As some persons began to admire Anees, others went to support Dabeer. Soon, two rival groups emerged. The masters did not like the development but supporters on either side wanted the controversy to continue, taking much perverse pleasure in deriding and ridiculing each other<U+2019>s hero.

=== Work on Poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz ===
[[File: Book-Name-Faiz-Fahmi.jpg|100px|left|center ]]

:::::* Faiz Fahmi<U+2014> Encyclopaedic work on life & thought of [[Faiz Ahmed Faiz]]
:::::* More than 1400 pages
:::::* 162 articles written on and about Faiz collected from all over the world
:::::* Dr Abedi himself has writeen 40 articles. Includes photographs, paintings & verses of Faiz.

This book <ref> Source: Pakistaniaat: A Journal of Pakistan Studies Vol. 5, No. 1 (2013) Book Review by Dr. Qaisar Abbas, University of North Texas, U.S.A.</ref> <ref> Source:Dr.Syed Taqi Abedi<U+2019>s Faiz Fahmi http://jang.com.pk/thenews/sep2011-weekly/nos-04-09-2011/lit.htm </ref> comprised of 162 [[Article (publishing)|articles]] on various aspects of Faiz by both Dr. Taqi Abedi and other [[scholars]] including [[Gopi Chand Narang]], Shams ur Rahman Faruqi, [[Shan-ul-Haq Haqqee]], Shamim Hanafi, [[Sajjad Zaheer]] , etc . While all articles are worth reading, the 41 articles written by Dr. Abedi stand out for their exploration of many untouched aspects of Faiz. The anthology includes articles of stalwarts of [[Urdu literature]] from across the world including [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Russia]], [[England]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and other countries. Articles of several [[England|English]] and [[Russia]]n [[writers]] such as George Fisher, Alexander Surikov, Lyudmala Vasilyeva and world leaders like [[Yasser Arafat]] also embellish the book. On the sensitive issue of Faiz<U+2019>s [[religion]], Abedi shows that despite his [[Marxist]] inclinations he remained a [[Muslim]] and often drew on [[Islamic]] themes in his [[poetry]], all his life events, including his marriage to Ellis Catherine ([[Alys Faiz]]), were conducted according to Islamic rites . He has also compiled a list of all the books that Faiz had read in his later years. This gives keen insights into the development of his thought. Author admiration of Faiz does not in any way come in his unbiased analysis and is reflected in the chapter dedicated to <U+201C>mistakes in Faiz poetry. In his comparison of Faiz and [[Josh Malihabadi]]  he lists their strengths and weaknesses without falling in the groupist trap of <U+201C>Faiz Bada Ya Josh Bada<U+201D> (big one is Faiz or Josh).

The book also includes five articles by Faiz himself on a variety of topics such as the progressive literary ideology, Josh as a revolutionary poet, films and culture, Beirut under the Israeli attack and his speech at the Lenin Peace Award ceremony. To supplement the exhaustive text Faiz Fahmi comes with scores of rare pictures of Faiz with various luminaries. It also has illustrations of his works by Sadiquain and other prominent artists. This exhaustive work is truly an encyclopaedia and is destined to prove indispensable to anyone planning to understand Faiz.<ref> Source:  http://blogs.thenews.com.pk/blogs/2012/04/faiz-fahmi/  </ref>

Dr. Taqi Abedi in his book <U+201C>Faiz fahmi<U+201D> has brought forward Faiz as a man, but we have hardly studied his poetry, his personality and poetry are both equally important to know. But his poetry is so layered that we can attain a [[PhD]]   degree in his  [[Poems]] <U+201D>. Although some  [[writers]] have said that he almost never used Persian words, this is wrong. Faiz probably used the most Persian words, but despite this, his allegories and his imagery was far easier to understand than was  <U+201C>[[Muhammad Iqbal]]<U+2019> s<U+201D>. He pointed out <U+2018><U+2019>Javednama<U+2019><U+2019> by Iqbal, where the poetry style is highly complex. <U+201C>Faiz also wrote some splendid verses for the  [[Iranians]] in  Persian but they know nothing of it, until the author of <U+201C>Faiz Fahmi<U+201D> introduced these in  [[Tehran]] some time back. We should bring forth our heroes so that others also know of them and their magnificence.<U+201D> in a lecture on his book <U+201C>Faiz Fahmi<U+201D> launch ceremony held at the [[Alhamra Arts Council]], organized in 2011 by [[Lahore Arts Council]], Dr. Taqi Abedi said that today about 1,800 books have been written on Faiz, but if he was a Persian, some 4,000 books would have been written. It was unfortunate that we ourselves never studied and learnt about our own writers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2011/10/05/city/lahore/syed-taqi-abidi%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98faiz-fehmi%E2%80%99-launched/ |title=Syed Taqi Abidi<U+2019>s <U+2018>Faiz Fehmi<U+2019> launched |publisher=Pakistan Today |date= |accessdate=2014-07-31}}</ref>

=== Research on Allama Iqbal ===
[[File:Choon-Marg-Ayed.jpg|150px|left|thumb | <small>Title page of Urdu Language Book  <U+201C>Choon Marg Ayed<U+201D> pertains to [[Muhammad Iqbal]] by [[Iqbal Academy]] </small> ]]

As a keynote speaker at the Annual Day in November, 2010 in the Auditorium of the East-West University, [[Chicago]], writer of <U+201C>Choon Marg Ayed<U+201D> and <U+201C>Iqbal Kay Irfani Zaweye<U+201D>  Dr. Taqi Abedi brought forward that [[Allama Iqbal]]<U+2019>s Javid Nama is at par with such other classic works as [[Saadi]]<U+2019>s [[Gulistan]], Diwan-e-[[Hafez]], [[Firdausi]]<U+2019>s [[Shahnama]] and Rumi<U+2019>s [[Masnavi]].<ref> Source: http://pakistanlink.org/Community/2010/Dec10/17/06.HTM  </ref>

Book  <U+201C>Choon Marg Ayed (Allama Iqbal key Amraz)<U+201D> is the publication of [[Iqbal Academy]] a statutory body of the Government of Pakistan, established through the Iqbal Academy Ordinance No. XXVI of 1962, and a centre of excellence for Iqbal Studies. <ref>  http://www.iap.gov.pk/intro.html </ref> This compilation <ref> http://www.sherosokhan.com/id382.html </ref> by Dr. Taqi Abedi,
Comprised of extracted contents from the various letters written by Allama Iqbal, provides detail of dissimilar [[diseases]] and the tolerance passion faced by [[Muhammad Iqbal]] during his life, is the heart of book and a source addition to [[biographic]] evaluation of  Allama Iqbal. This book also highlights the grip of Dr. Taqi to his professional competency as [[Cardiologist]] and [[Physician]].

In October, 2009, at [[Maulana Azad National Urdu University]] (MANUU), [[Hyderabad]], India, Dr. Taqi Abedi has delivered extension lectures on Allama Iqbal on the chosen topic <U+201C>''Iqbal ka Falsafa-e-Ishq''<U+201D> <ref>    http://www.manuu.ac.in/centerforurdu_events.php </ref>.  This topic may be seen on line as an article  <ref>  In Urdu Language at http://www.drtaqiabedi.com/-/Aritcles/Articles%20-%201.pdf </ref>.  According to academic research of Dr. Taqi, it is revealed  that Iqbal was influenced with [[Maulana Rumi]] in his [[philosophy]] of <U+201C>[[Ishq]]<U+201D>(pure love/devotion above [[materialistic]] love) and used this ''Ishq'' more than thirty times in his poetry with a singular reference to [[Prophet Muhammad]] and [[Almighty]]. This ''Ishq'' classifies that there is no place in [[heart]] if it is inhabited by loved one, making it as a concern of supra [[knowledge]].

== Books written/compiled ==
Researched based writing and compiling from the 8th decade of 20th century, Dr. Taqi Abedi had over 36 books at his credit.  Brief description of his books/compilation/translation is tabulated here under:.<ref> An Old Ref: http://www.adabnuma.org/qalamkar.php?&page=24 </ref>

:*Dr. Taqi Abedi presented  a review of Dabeer<U+2019>s quatrains  at an  International Seminar on <U+201C>Position of Anis and Dabir in Urdu literature<U+201D>  organized by Anis and Dabeer Academy, London on the occasion of bicentennial birthday celebrations of [[Mir Anis]] and [[Mirza Dabeer]].<ref>{{cite web|author=The Milli Gazette, OPI, Pharos Media |url=http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/2003/16-31Dec03-Print-Edition/1612200343a.htm |title=Community News, The Milli Gazette, Vol.4 No.24, MG94 (16-31 Dec 03) |publisher=Milligazette.com |date=2003-12-31 |accessdate=2014-07-31}}</ref>
