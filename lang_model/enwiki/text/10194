The [[Anglican]] '''St Andrew's Church''' is on the outskirts of [[Chew Stoke]], within the English county of [[Somerset]]. The church, parts of which date from the 15th century, is a Grade II* [[listed building]].

The stone church's three-stage tower has six bells, three of which were made by the local [[Bilbie family]], to whom a redundant bell at the back of the church serves as a memorial. The interior of the church is largely [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and includes 156 angels in wood and stone. The churchyard includes graves and memorials to local residents and the base of a 14th-century cross. The remains of the cross from Morteon were moved to Chew Stoke when their original site was flooded during the construction of [[Chew Valley Lake]] in the 1950s.

The Parish of Chew Stoke is within the [[Benefice]] of Chew Stoke with [[Nempnett Thrubwell]] and forms part of the [[Diocese of Bath and Wells]]. Two rectories are associated with the church, one dating from 1529 and both now private residences.

==Architecture==
The church was constructed in the 15th century in the [[perpendicular style]]. The tower remains largely unchanged, but the main body underwent extensive [[Victorian restoration]] and the addition of the north isle in 1862.<ref name=nhlechurch/> The church is built of local red sandstone and limestone topped by lead roofs. It includes a [[nave]], four bay north [[aisle]] and three bay south aisle, [[chancel]] and south chapel.<ref name=nhlechurch/>

The tower, which was built around 1475, has three stages supported by diagonal [[buttress]]es. Its top is surmounted by a paneled [[parapet]] and an ornate crown with an elaborate spirelet over the stair [[turret]], with two tiers of arcading.<ref name="poyntz">{{cite book |last=Poyntz Wright |first=Peter |title=The Parish Church Towers of Somerset, Their construction, craftsmanship and chronology 1350<U+2013>1550 |year=1981 |publisher=Avebury Publishing Company |isbn=0-86127-502-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Pevsner |first=Nikolaus |year=1958 |title=The Buildings of England: North Somerset and Bristol |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=0-300-09640-2}}</ref>

The oldest bell in the tower dates from 1698 and was cast by the [[Bilbie family]] who were [[Bellfounding|bell founders]] and [[clockmaker]]s based initially in the village. The Bilbie family produced more than 1,350 [[Church bell|bells]], which are hung in churches all over the [[West Country]]. Supplies of the [[tin]] and [[copper]] used to make [[bell metal]] were probably obtained from [[brass]] foundries in [[Kelston]] and [[Bristol]]. The metal was melted in a wood-burning furnace to over {{convert|1500|C|F|0}} and then poured into a mould made from [[loam]], or foundry mud, from the [[River Chew]].<ref name="bilbiebook">{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=James |last2=Rice |first2=Roy |last3=Hucker |first3=Ernest |year=1995 |title=Bilbie and the Chew Valley clockmakers: the story of the renowned family of Somerset bellfounder-clockmakers /Clockmakers |publisher=The authors  isbn=0-9526702-0-8 }}</ref> Others in St Andrew's are from the same maker are dated 1718 and 1731.<ref name="bilbiebook"/> The bells were tuned and re-hung into a new frame in 1908 and again in 1996 with a new bell from [[John Taylor & Co|John Taylor's foundry]] in Loughborough replacing the treble. The redundant bell is now on display at the back of the church as a memorial to the Bilbies.<ref name="bilbiebook"/>

There is also a [[stained glass]] window showing a saint with a sword standing on a snake and crossed flags, commemorating those from World War II.<ref>{{cite web | title=Chew Stoke WWII Ref: 7489 | work=United Kingdom National Inventory of Ward Memorials | url=http://www.ukniwm.org.uk/server/show/conMemorial.7489/fromUkniwmSearch/1 | accessdate=19 May 2006}}</ref> Several other stained glass windows date from the [[Victorian era]]. The window in the tower was donated by a London goldsmith named Mattheson to commemorate the rebuilding of the church in 1863. The east window represents events in the life of [[Saint Andrew]].

One of the alters has, in the past, been dedicated to [[Wilgefortis]] a female [[saint]] of popular religious imagination whose legend arose in the 14th century, and whose distinguishing feature is a large beard.<ref name=cooke>{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=Edward|title=The Parish Church of St Andrew.

There are three wooden chests, two of which date from the 20th century, but the oldest is probably from the 16th century and was a "poor man's chest." These were common in English parishes following the decree by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] that each parish provide a strong chest with three keys to keep safe custody of alms for the poor.<ref name=cooke/>

==Old rectory==
[[File:Rectorychewstoke.JPG|thumb|left|The Old Rectory, south front with carvings of shields]]

The village hall is at the end of Church Lane, opposite [[The Rectory, Chew Stoke|The Rectory]] which is believed to have been built in 1529 by the rector, Sir John Barry, (Rector 1524<U+2013>46). It has undergone substantial renovations including the addition of a [[clock tower]] for the Rev. W. P. Wait, which has since been removed and further alterations in about 1876 for Rev. J. Ellershaw. The building has an ornate south front with carvings of shields bearing the coat of arms of the St Loe family, who were once chief landowners in the area, alone or impaled with arms of Fitzpane, Ancell, de la Rivere and Malet. It is Grade II* listed.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rectory |work=Images of England |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=32964 |accessdate=9 May 2006}}</ref> In 1945 it started to be used again as the rectory, for the parish.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hucker |first=Ernest|title=Chew Stoke recalled in old photographs |year=1997 |publisher=Ernest Hucker |pages=45<U+2013>46}}</ref> The parish is within the [[Benefice]] of Chew Stoke with [[Nempnett Thrubwell]] and forms part of the [[Diocese of Bath and Wells]].<ref>{{cite web |title=St Andrew, Chew Stoke |url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/chew-stoke-st-andrew/ |work=A Church Near You |publisher=Church of England |accessdate=16 March 2014}}</ref> The rectory was sold by the church in 2008 and is now a private dwelling.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jennings |first=Anthony |title=The Old Rectory: The Story of the English Parsonage |year=2009 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-8264-2658-1 |page=95 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=SZLyDoO1YA4C&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&dq=rectory+chew+stoke#v=onepage&q=rectory%20chew%20stoke&f=false}}</ref>

==New rectory==
[[File:Oldrectory.JPG|thumb|The new rectory]]
The new rectory was built by the Reverend John Ellershaw in the 1870s. The last rector to occupy it was Lionel St. Clair Waldy from 1907 to 1945. It was then bought by Douglas Wills who donated it and the rectory field to [[Winford]] Hospital as a [[Sanatorium|convalescent home]] for 16 children, and later used as a nurses' home before being sold for private use.<ref name="hucker" /> Primarily an orthopaedic hospital, Winford was built in 1930, and became a part-military and part-civilian hospital. Wards A to D were for civilian use, while wards E to K, added to the hospital in 1940, were for the treatment of service and civilian war casualties.<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC&nbsp;<U+2013> WW2 People's War |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/08/a3816308.shtml |accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref> The hospital closed in 1996, and the rectory is now divided into several residential units.<ref>{{cite web |title=Old Rectory |work=Images of England |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=32963 |accessdate=9 May 2006}}</ref>
