'''David Cutcliffe''' (born September 16, 1954) is the head football coach of the [[Duke University]] [[Duke Blue Devils football|Blue Devils]].  He is best known for coaching [[Super Bowl MVP]] [[Peyton Manning]] at the [[Tennessee Volunteers football|University of Tennessee]], and Manning's younger brother and fellow Super Bowl Champion [[Eli Manning|Eli]] at the [[Ole Miss Rebels football|University of Mississippi]]. Almost all offensive records at both schools were set during Cutcliffe's time as coach.

==Early life==
Cutcliffe was born and raised in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], which played a formative role in his development as a football coach.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://media.www.dukechronicle.com/media/storage/paper884/news/2009/04/09/News/Cutcliffe.Recalls.Tension.From.Past-3704414.shtml|title=Cutcliffe recalls tension from past|first=Ben|last=Cohen|publisher=Duke Chronicle|date=2009-04-09}}</ref> He has two brothers (Charles "Paige" Cutcliffe, and Raymond Eugene "JR." Cutcliffe) and three sisters (Mary Marlyn Cutcliffe Sullivan, Margart Lynn Cutcliffe, and Elizabeth "Buff" Cutcliffe Easterly.)  Cutcliffe attended [[L. Frazier Banks Middle School|Banks High School]] in Birmingham where he played football.  He attended the University of Alabama where he worked as a student assistant on [[Bear Bryant|Bear Bryant's]] Alabama staff.

==Early coaching history==
Cutcliffe's coaching career began as a student assistant to [[Bear Bryant]] at the [[University of Alabama]].  In 1976 he took a job at Banks High School where he served as an assistant and later as the head coach. In 1982, he was hired as a part time coach at the University of Tennessee. A year later, he was promoted to full time status as the tight ends and assistant offensive line coach. By 1990, Cutcliffe was coaching the position he is now well known for, quarterbacks. Cutcliffe was promoted to offensive coordinator in 1993. As coordinator, Cutcliffe helped lead the Vols to two [[Southeastern Conference]] championships and a [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championship]].

==Head coaching==
On December 2, 1998, Cutcliffe was hired as the head football coach at Ole Miss.  Cutcliffe had success at Ole Miss, where he recruited [[Eli Manning]], son of Ole Miss player [[Archie Manning]], to play quarterback.  In 2003, Cutcliffe tied LSU for the West Division title and a win in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic]].

Cutcliffe was fired by Ole Miss's Athletic Director [[Pete Boone]] in December 2004 after his only losing season at Ole Miss. Boone had asked Cutcliffe to provide a detailed plan for improving the program, specifically the defense and recruiting, as well as fire some assistant coaches, but Cutcliffe refused to fire any staff members, and was subsequently fired along with his assistants.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=1936031 Associated Press via ESPN: Coach reportedly refused to ax coordinators]</ref>

==Post Mississippi==
After his stint at Ole Miss, Cutcliffe was hired as the Assistant Head Coach and quarterbacks coach at [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], but health problems forced him to resign before his first season there. In 2005, he underwent successful triple-bypass surgery to correct a 99-percent blocked artery.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://media.www.dukechronicle.com/media/storage/paper884/news/2008/09/22/Football/Leading.With.The.Heart-3444104.shtml|title=Leading with the heart|first=Ben|last=Cohen|publisher=Duke Chronicle|date=2008-09-22}}</ref> After taking a year off he returned to [[Knoxville]] to coach Tennessee again and join his sons, Chris Cutcliffe and Marcus Hilliard, then Tennessee students, on campus (his daughter, Katie Cutcliffe, is a current Tennessee student). After Cutcliffe's successor as offensive coordinator at Tennessee, [[Randy Sanders]], resigned, [[Phillip Fulmer]] rehired Cutcliffe to replace him.

Cutcliffe led a major turnaround of the Tennessee offense during the [[2006 Tennessee Volunteers football team|2006 season]]. Tennessee quarterback [[Erik Ainge]] ranked among the nation's top 25 passers by yardage, and [[Robert Meachem]] had the third-most receiving yards of any player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/statistics/_/year/2006|title=2006 NCAA Football Statistics|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

==Duke University==
Cutcliffe was hired as the head football coach at [[Duke University]] on December 14, 2007,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2007/12/14/1164776-ap-duke-hires-cutcliffe-as-coach|title=AP: Duke Hires Cutcliffe As Coach|first=Joedy|last=McCreary|publisher=Associated Press|date=2007-12-14}}</ref> replacing [[Ted Roof]], who had amassed a 6&ndash;45 win-loss record (3&ndash;33 in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]]) over four-plus years at the school.  Duke has had only three winning seasons in the last 25 years and, before the 2008 season, had not beaten an ACC opponent in over three seasons.<ref name="Dukefootballbooklet">{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/acc/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/duke-37-42.pdf|title=Duke Blue Devils 2004 Football booklet|publisher=Theacc.com|accessdate=2007-06-12}}</ref> 

Cutcliffe immediately began a strength and conditioning program, challenging the team to collectively lose 1,000 [[pound (mass)|pounds]] after finding the team in less than ideal physical shape.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://media.www.dukechronicle.com/media/storage/paper884/news/2008/01/31/Football/Cutcliffes.CutThroat.Conditioning.Challenge-3180261.shtml|title= CUTCLIFFE'S CUT-THROAT CONDITIONING CHALLENGE|first=Will |last=Flaherty|work=Duke Chronicle|date=2008-01-31|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref>

On Saturday, August 30, 2008, David Cutcliffe won his first game as Duke's head coach, defeating the [[James Madison University|James Madison]] [[James Madison Dukes|Dukes]] 31&ndash;7, before a crowd of 32,571, the largest in Wallace Wade Stadium since 1994.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/sports/college/duke/football/story/1200988.html|title=Devils dispose of Dukes|first=A.J.|last=Carr|work=[[News & Observer]]|publisher=McClatchy|date=2008-08-31|accessdate=2008-08-31}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www2.journalnow.com/content/2008/aug/31/duke-opens-season-with-victory-against-jmu-31-7/|title= Duke opens season with victory against JMU 31-7 |first= John|last= Dell |work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|date=2008-08-31|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref> The game marked the introduction of a number of rituals that Cutcliffe hopes to turn into Duke traditions, including the Blue Devil Walk, which parades the players and coaching staff from [[Duke Chapel]], through [[Duke University#West.2C East.2C and Central Campuses|West Campus]] and past [[Cameron Indoor Stadium]] to [[Wallace Wade Stadium]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goduke.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=4200&ATCLID=1572991|title= Cutcliffe Thanks Fans For Attending First Game|first= Michael |last=Tomko|date=2008-08-31|accessdate=2008-08-31|work=GoDuke.com}}</ref> and the "Blue Devil Rock", located in the stadium tunnel and mined from the same quarry used in the construction of Duke's West Campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dukebasketballreport.com/articles/?p=25649|title=Cutcliffe For President! Duke 31, JMU 7|date=2008-08-31|accessdate=2008-08-31|work=DukeBasketBallReport.com}}</ref>

In Cutcliffe's second game, Duke lost to [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]] in a mirror image game of the previous season's matchup, twice falling short of a touchdown deep in Northwestern territory. After the home loss against Northwestern, Duke hosted [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]], prevailing 41&ndash;31. Cutcliffe next led Duke to its first ACC victory since 2004, with a 31&ndash;3 rout of [[Virginia Cavaliers football|Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=282710150|title=Duke capitalizes on five second-half turnovers in rout|accessdate=30 November 2008}}</ref> This was a complete turnaround from the team's 2006 game against UVA, in which the Blue Devils were shut out 37&ndash;0 in Wallace Wade. Duke proceeded to lose to [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] and [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]] before notching its first road win of the season, a 10&ndash;7 victory over SEC opponent [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]]. Next, on the road at [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons football|Wake Forest]], Duke lost a heartbreaker in overtime, 33&ndash;30, missing what would have been a game-winning field goal at the end of regulation. This was another in a string of such painful kicking miscues for the Blue Devils, including a miss at [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|North Carolina]] in the previous season. The next game, Duke went on to lose to [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]], 31&ndash;7, before fighting to a surprisingly close 14&ndash;3 loss to powerhouse [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]] and suffering a disappointing close loss to [[Duke-Carolina rivalry|arch-rival North Carolina]] at season's end.

In January 2010, following [[Lane Kiffin|Lane Kiffin's]] abrupt departure after just one season at the helm of the Tennessee football team, Cutcliffe quickly emerged as a leading candidate to replace Kiffin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=4825513|title=Tennessee Volunteers' search focused on David Cutcliffe, sources say|accessdate=16 January 2010|work=ESPN.com}}</ref> Cutcliffe, however, ultimately rebuffed Tennessee's overtures, remaining at Duke and stating, <U+201C>After much thought and consideration, Karen and I reached the decision that Duke is the place for our family. We have both family members and lifetime friends in the Knoxville community and share a deep respect for the University of Tennessee. Our ties to the school and the Eastern Tennessee area are obvious. But before Tennessee<U+2019>s hiring process comes to a conclusion, I know that Duke University is where we want to coach.<U+201D><ref>{{cite news|url=http://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/cutcliffe-will-stay-at-duke/|title=Cutcliffe will stay at Duke|accessdate=16 January 2010|work=New York Times | first=Ray | last=Glier | date=2010-01-15}}</ref> Cutcliffe's decision was widely lauded as a rare example of commitment and integrity among prominent college football coaches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com/pages/full_story/push?article-Cutcliffe+staying+at+Duke%20&id=5573696&instance=main_article|title=Cutcliffe staying at Duke|accessdate=16 January 2010|work=Durham Herald-Sun}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/ncfnation/post/_/id/18177/cutcliffes-loyalty-rewards-duke-acc|title=Cutcliffe's loyalty rewards Duke, ACC|accessdate=16 January 2010|work=ESPN.com}}</ref>

==QB coaching==
Six quarterbacks whom Cutcliffe coached in college have gone on to play in the [[NFL]]: [[Heath Shuler]], [[Peyton Manning]], [[Eli Manning]],  [[Erik Ainge]], and [[Thaddeus Lewis]]. Cutcliffe also coached [[Colorado Rockies]] [[first baseman]] [[Todd Helton]] while Helton played quarterback at Tennessee.

==Family==
Cutcliffe is married to the former Karen Oran of [[Harriman, Tennessee]].  They have four children: Marcus, Chris, Katie, and Emily.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.goduke.com}}</ref>
