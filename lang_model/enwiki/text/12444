'''Rik Van Steenbergen''' ([[9 September]], [[1924]] &ndash; [[15 May]] [[2003]]) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[racing cyclist]], considered to be one of the best among the great number of successful Belgian cyclists.

==Career==

Van Steenbergen was born in [[Arendonk]] in a poor family. He started cycling as a professional during [[World War II]] in 1942, after being an amateur since he was 14. The next year, he won his first important races, and became Belgian road cycling champion. In 1944, he won the [[Ronde van Vlaanderen]] [[Classic cycle races|Classic]], which he won again two years later. 

During his career, which lasted until 1966, Van Steenbergen won several more classics: [[Paris-Roubaix]], [[Paris-Brussels]] and [[Milan-Sanremo]]. He also won the [[World Road Cycling Championships]] three times (1949, 1956 and 1957), equalling the (still standing) record of [[Alfredo Binda]]. His last world title, a year after his second, was won in front of a home crowd. In addition, he placed third in the first post-war championships in 1946.

Van Steenbergen also excelled on the track, and won 40 [[Six-day racing|Six-day events]], and improved two world records. His track capabilities made him an excellent road sprinter. However, he usually had difficulty climbing, which prevented him from winning major stage races. He nevertheless placed 2nd in the 1951 [[Giro d'Italia]]. Some suggest he could have competed for victory in stage races had he concentrated on them, instead of racing almost every race he could enter. It is estimated Van Steenbergen won slightly fewer than 1000 races, though accounts differ widely.

Van Steenbergen died in [[Antwerp]] after a prolonged sickness at the age of 78. The funeral was in the ''Sint Pauluskerk'' of [[Westmalle]], attended by about 2000 people, including [[Eddy Merckx]], [[Rik van Looy]], [[Roger De Vlaeminck]], [[Walter Godefroot]], [[Johan De Muynck]], [[Lucien van Impe]], [[Freddy Maertens]] and [[Briek Schotte]]. The [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]] president [[Hein Verbruggen]] and Belgian prime minister [[Guy Verhofstadt]] also attended.
