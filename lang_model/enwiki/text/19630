'''''Final Fantasy Legend II''''', originally released in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo title|Sa<U+30FB>Ga 2: Hih<U+014D> Densetsu|Sa<U+30FB>Ga 2: <U+79D8><U+5B9D><U+4F1D><U+8AAC>| lit. SaGa 2: Treasure Legend}}, is a [[console role-playing game|role-playing video game]] developed by [[Square Co.]] for the [[Game Boy]] handheld console as part of their ''[[SaGa (series)|SaGa]]'' series. Initially released in December 1990 for Japanese audiences, the game was translated and released in North America in November 1991 by Square America Co, and again in 1998 by [[Sunsoft]].  Like its predecessor, the English version was re-branded as a ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' title due to the series' popularity in the Western world.  The game's development was headed by lead designer [[Akitoshi Kawazu]], who had worked on the previous title, with a music staff consisting of [[Kenji Ito]] and [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. In 2009, an [[video game remake|enhanced remake]] of the game was announced for the [[Nintendo DS]] featuring three-dimensional graphics, new story elements, and an arranged soundtrack.<ref name="Remake">{{cite web | author=Tanaka, John | date=January 14, 2009 | title=Final Fantasy Legends 2 Set for DS | url=http://uk.ds.ign.com/articles/944/944862p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref>

The game is set in a [[fantasy]] world where the player assumes the role of one of eight different characters of varying race and gender who leaves on a journey to find their lost father and discover the secret of "Magi", a substance created by the gods that holds powerful magic. ''Final Fantasy Legend II'' was largely well-received worldwide during its original release, with readers of Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' voting it the 94th greatest game of all time in a 2006 poll.  

== Gameplay ==
[[Image:Final Fantasy Legend II Screenshot.png|thumb|left|A battle from the original Game Boy version]]
Like ''[[The Final Fantasy Legend]]'', multiple character classes are available; Human, Mutant, Monster, and, new to the series in this installment, Robot.<ref name="IGN"/> Players pick their characters class at the beginning of the game.<ref name="IGN"/> Side characters also join the party at various points in the story.<ref name="IGN"/>

Noticeably, much like second installment of the actual ''Final Fantasy'' series, the playable characters' attributes are dependent on what results from battle. At the end of each battle a character has a chance to gain a stat increase (Strength, Defense, Agility, Mana, HP.) If a character uses a strength based weapon, then they may gain strength, defensive items increase defense points, agility based weapons increase agility, and magic increases mana.  HP seems to level up randomly, as characters who do absolutely nothing in a battle (attack or take damage) potentially can increase in HP. This system does not take into account the strength of the monster that is being engaged.

Potentially, a player could get 99 in all 4 stats and 999 HP before leaving the first world, though this would be incredibly time consuming. Robots and Monsters do not level up in this fashion, however. Monsters grow in strength by eating the meat of fallen monsters, and Robots increase in abilities by equipping armor and weapons with greater power, defense or speed.

== Plot ==
The story in ''Final Fantasy Legend II'' revolves around MAGI, the shards of a shattered statue of the goddess, Isis. The Hero is awakened by his father, who explains he has to leave for a while. He then makes his way through the Hero's open window. Years later, the Hero decides to set out to find his father, and eventually joins a fight involving new gods bent on taking over the world and the Guardians, an organization dedicated to the protection of MAGI and to keep it from falling into the wrong hands.

The player visits twelve distinct worlds, in addition to the Celestial World and the shrine at its center. The goal of the game is to collect the varied pieces of MAGI scattered around each of these worlds. These MAGI pieces can also be equipped by your characters to increase stats or grant special abilities.

== Development ==
''Final Fantasy Legend II'' was developed by [[Square Co.]] in 1990 under its original Japanese title ''Sa<U+30FB>Ga 2: Hih<U+014D> Densetsu''. The project was headed by [[Akitoshi Kawazu]] and Hiromichi Tanaka, who had previously developed the game's predecessor, ''[[The Final Fantasy Legend]]'' one year earlier. The game's music staff was comprised of [[Nobuo Uematsu]], famous for his involvement in the Square's ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, and [[Kenji Ito]] who had composed the music for the previous title.<ref name="IGN"/> Kawazu designed the game to have "a strong presence of randomness" when determining how characters grow and gain new skills from battle, a trait which would carry over to future games in the series.<ref name="1upinterview" />  In December 1991, the game's music would be released by [[NTT Publishing]] on a compilation soundtrack featuring themes from the first three ''Final Fantasy Legend'' games called ''[[Discography of the SaGa series#All Sounds of SaGa|All Sounds of SaGa]]''.<ref name="RPGFan">{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/saga-aso/index.html |title= All Sounds of SaGa | publisher = [[RPGFan]] |author= Gann, Patrick |date = 2001-03-21| accessdate = 2009-03-22}}</ref>  The album's popularity would allow it to be reprinted in December 2004.<ref name="RPGFan" />

In November 1991, the game was translated and released in English by [[Square Co.|Square America]].  Like its predecessor, it was re-branded as a ''Final Fantasy'' title despite having no relation to the series due to the popularity of the franchise in North America.<ref name="Name">{{cite journal |author=Kennedy, Sam and Steinman, Gary |date= August 2001 |title="Milking The Final Fantasy Franchise" |journal=[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]] |issue= 44 |page=99}}</ref>  Due to the popularity of the game, [[Sunsoft|Sunsoft America Corp.]] entered into a deal with Square to obtain the publishing rights to a re-release of the three ''Final Fantasy Legend'' titles, which were made available in July 1998.<ref name="IGN" />  Despite advertising the game as being compatible with Nintendo's [[Game Boy Color]] handheld, the re-released version featured no new enhancements or any increased color palette, and was contained in the same 2-[[megabit]] [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]] as the original.<ref name="IGN" />

=== Nintendo DS version ===
[[Image:saga2ds.jpg|thumb|right|Screenshot from the Nintendo DS remake]]
In January 2009, Japanese magazine ''[[Shonen Jump]]'' announced that a remake of ''Final Fantasy Legend II'' for the [[Nintendo DS]] was being developed and directed by Kawazu himself and would feature fully three-dimensional [[Cel-shaded animation|cel-shaded]] graphics.<ref name="Remake"/> In an interview with ''[[Famitsu]]'' magazine, Kawazu stated that he and his team had been planning a remake of the game ever since they remade ''The Final Fantasy Legend'' for the [[WonderSwan Color]] in 2002, and went ahead with the project now that they felt "the time was right".<ref name="1upinterview">{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3172398 |title= SaGa 2 Producer Discusses DS Remake | publisher = [[1UP.com]] |author= Gifford, Kevin |date = 2009-01-21| accessdate = 2009-03-22}}</ref>  Youichi Yoshimoto, who had previously worked on ''[[Unlimited Saga]]'', was appointed project supervisor, along with Kenji Ito who will be arranging the game's soundtrack.<ref name="official">{{cite web |url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/saga2/ |title= SaGa 2 Hihou Densetsu official website | publisher = [[Square Enix]] |language= Japanese |year = 2009 |accessdate = 2009-03-22}}</ref> Gen Kobayashi, character designer for Square Enix's ''[[The World Ends with You]]'', provides the game's new promotional and character artwork.<ref name="official" />

The remake was produced to add new features but still keep the core story and gameplay of the original, and is designed to retain the Game Boy version's play time of "ten-odd hours" from start to finish, which Kawazu feels is adequate for a handheld role-playing game, stating "This is on a portable system, and for that I think it's better not to have a game you must sit down and play for hours on end, but rather something you can enjoy in small pieces at a time."<ref name="1upinterview" />  Unlike the Game Boy version, battles in the Nintendo DS version no longer occur randomly, and were adjusted to be more like later games in the ''SaGa'' series where enemies appear on the field screen along with the player and are encountered when touched.<ref name="famitsu" /> Also unlike the original, where a character's stat increases through gaining levels was largely randomized, characters now become stronger in a "less opaque" fashion, with more defined growth tables for each playable character.<ref name="famitsu">{{cite journal| journal=[[Famitsu|Weekly Famitsu]] |title= SaGa 2: Akitoshi Kawazu Interview |language= Japanese |date= 2009-01-21 |issue= 1051}}</ref> The game will be released sometime in 2009 to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the ''SaGa'' series.<ref name="1upinterview" />

''Final Fantasy Legend II'' has sold an estimated 850,000 copies in Japan since its release in December 1990.<ref name="famitsu" /> In March 2006, the title was voted the 94th best game of all time by the readers of ''[[Famitsu]]'' magazine as part of its "All Time Top 100" poll.<ref>{{cite web |date= 2006-03-03 |title= Japan Votes on All Time Top 100 |url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/japan-votes-all-time-top-100?page=0%2C1 | publisher=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge Online]] |accessdate=2008-12-13}}</ref>

The game was mostly well-received during its release in North America.  ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' declared it to be superior to its predecessor, calling it "longer and more involving than Square Soft's original Game Boy RPG".<ref name="NP" />  The magazine also found it to be more user-friendly, stating that it "includes features that will make playing more enjoyable for both RPG enthusiasts and beginners", but found it mostly lacking in play control.<ref name="NP" />  During their annual Nintendo Power Awards, ''Final Fantasy Legend II'' was nominated for "Most Challenging Game Boy Game" of 1991.<ref name="NP2">{{cite journal|journal= [[Nintendo Power]] |issue= 34 |page= 96 |title= Nintendo Power Awards '91 - The Nesters! |date= March 1992}}</ref>  In their review of the 1998 re-release, [[IGN]] found that the game had aged when compared to more modern role-playing titles and that "gamers jaded with today's FMVs and polygon graphics may find it hard to get drawn into a game with simple sprite characters."<ref name="IGN" />  Regardless of the game's antiquity, the website still found it to be a solid game with "great character development, a breathtaking score and a solid Role-Playing game engine, there is very little that stands in the way of an RPG gamer and this title," calling it "by far" the best of the ''Final Fantasy Legend'' games.<ref name="IGN" />  The game maintains a 90% average rating on aggregate review website [[GameRankings]] based on two reviews.<ref name="GR" />
