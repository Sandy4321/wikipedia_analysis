'''State Route 362''' ('''SR&nbsp;362''') is a {{convert|32.5|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[State highway (US)|state highway]] located in the west-central part of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. It is mainly a rural route, passing through parts of [[Meriwether County, Georgia|Meriwether]], [[Pike County, Georgia|Pike]], and [[Spalding County, Georgia|Spalding]] [[County (United States)|counties]], connecting the [[Greenville, Georgia|Greenville]] area with [[Griffin, Georgia|Griffin]], via [[Williamson, Georgia|Williamson]].

The roadway had an eastern segment built by the end of 1953. This segment was effectively extended to the west the following year. In 1960, the western segment was built. Before the decade was over, it had been designated as SR&nbsp;362, the Alvaton<U+2013>Hollondale segment was built, and the SR&nbsp;362 designated was extended along the rest of the roadway.

==Route description==
SR&nbsp;362 begins at an [[Intersection (road)|intersection]] with [[U.S. Route 27 Alternate (Georgia)|US&nbsp;27 Alternate]]/[[Georgia State Route 41|SR&nbsp;41]] north of [[Greenville, Georgia|Greenville]], in Meriwether County, and travels to the northeast, through [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] and generally [[rural area]]s of the county. The highway has a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[Georgia State Route 74|SR&nbsp;74]]/[[Georgia State Route 85|SR&nbsp;85]] for about {{convert|1|mi|km}} south-southwest of [[Haralson, Georgia|Haralson]]. SR&nbsp;362 then travels to the east, crossing the [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]] into Pike County. It then curves back to the northeast, crossing into Spalding County before reaching an [[Interchange (road)|interchange]] with [[U.S. Route 19 in Georgia|US&nbsp;19]]/[[U.S. Route 41 in Georgia|US&nbsp;41]]/[[Georgia State Route 3|SR&nbsp;3]] ([[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King Jr.]] Parkway) in [[Griffin, Georgia|Griffin]]. The route continues to the northeast, passing northwest of Municipal Park. Then, it turns right onto West Poplar Street and meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with [[U.S. Route 19 Business (Griffin, Georgia)|US&nbsp;19 Business]]/[[U.S. Route 41 Business (Griffin, Georgia)|US&nbsp;41 Business]]/[[Georgia State Route 155|SR&nbsp;155]] (South Hill Street) in downtown.<ref name="Google"/>

The only part of SR&nbsp;362 that is included as part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]], a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility, is the section east of US&nbsp;19/US&nbsp;41/SR&nbsp;3 in Griffin.<ref name="NHS Georgia">{{cite web|title=National Highway System: Georgia|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/georgia/ga_georgia.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=United States Department of Transportation|date=October 1, 2012|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref>

==History==
The road that would eventually become SR&nbsp;362 was established by the end of 1953. It was the east-northeast segment of a roadway that started in [[Zebulon, Georgia|Zebulon]], traveled to the north-northwest into Williamson, and curved to the east-northeast and entered Griffin.<ref name="GDOT 1952">{{cite map|title=Georgia State Highway System|url=http://www.dot.ga.gov/informationcenter/maps/Documents/StateMaps/1952.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Georgia State Highway Department|date=January 1, 1952|cartography=GSHD|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref><ref name="GDOT 1953">{{cite map|title=Georgia State Highway System|url=http://www.dot.ga.gov/informationcenter/maps/Documents/StateMaps/1953.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Georgia State Highway Department|date=September 1, 1953|cartography=GSHD|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref> By the middle of 1954, another section from the current Kings Bridge Road intersection (in [[Hollonville, Georgia|Hollonville]]) east to Williamson, was added.<ref name="GDOT 1953"/><ref name="GDOT 1954">{{cite map|title=Georgia State Highway System|url=http://www.dot.ga.gov/informationcenter/maps/Documents/StateMaps/1954.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Georgia State Highway Department|date=June 1, 1954|cartography=GSHD|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref>

By the middle of 1960, the section from the current western terminus to the western intersection with SR&nbsp;85 (SR&nbsp;74 hadn't been designated along the highway at that time), just south of Alvaton, was built.<ref name="GDOT 1957">{{cite map|title=Georgia State Highway System|url=http://www.dot.ga.gov/informationcenter/maps/Documents/StateMaps/1957.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Georgia State Highway Department|date=July 1, 1957|cartography=GSHD|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref><ref name="GDOT 1960">{{cite map|title=Georgia State Highway System|url=http://www.dot.ga.gov/informationcenter/maps/Documents/StateMaps/1960_1961.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Georgia State Highway Department|date=June 1, 1960|cartography=GSHD|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref> By 1966, this segment was designated as SR&nbsp;362.<ref name="GDOT 1963">{{cite map|title=Georgia State Highway System|url=http://www.dot.ga.gov/informationcenter/maps/Documents/StateMaps/1963.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Georgia State Highway Department|date=June 1, 1963|cartography=GSHD|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref><ref name="GDOT 1966">{{cite map|title=Georgia State Highway System|url=http://www.dot.ga.gov/informationcenter/maps/Documents/StateMaps/1966.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Georgia State Highway Department|date=January 1, 1966|cartography=GSHD|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref>

In 1967, the portion of roadway from Alvaton to Hollonville was built, thus completing the current length.<ref name="GDOT 1967">{{cite map|title=Georgia State Highway System|url=http://www.dot.ga.gov/informationcenter/maps/Documents/StateMaps/1967.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Georgia State Highway Department|date=January 1, 1967|cartography=GSHD|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref><ref name="GDOT 1968">{{cite map|title=Georgia State Highway System|url=http://www.dot.ga.gov/informationcenter/maps/Documents/StateMaps/1968.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Georgia State Highway Department|date=January 1, 1968|cartography=GSHD|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref> The next year, the entire road was designated as SR&nbsp;362.<ref name="GDOT 1968"/><ref name="GDOT 1969">{{cite map|title=Georgia State Highway System|url=http://www.dot.ga.gov/informationcenter/maps/Documents/StateMaps/1969.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Georgia State Highway Department|date=January 1, 1969|cartography=GSHD|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref>
