"'''Fear Her'''" is the eleventh [[list of Doctor Who serials|episode]] of the [[Doctor Who (series 2)|second series]] of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 24 June 2006. It was written by [[Matthew Graham]] and directed by [[Euros Lyn]].

The episode takes part on the day of the [[Olympic Games#Opening|opening ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, almost exclusively on a fictitious [[cul-de-sac]] named after the British athlete [[Kelly Holmes]]. While originally only intending to visit the ceremony, alien time traveller the [[Tenth Doctor|Doctor]] ([[David Tennant]]) and his [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]) investigate Chloe Webber (Abisola Agbaje), who has the ability to make people disappear by drawing them.

An overcommissioned episode which was brought in to be a low-budget replacement for a script by [[Stephen Fry]] that had been pushed back, "Fear Her" was filmed mainly in the [[Tremorfa]] area of Cardiff at a housing estate. Graham was asked to write an episode primarily for children which would soften the much darker finale that would be broadcast after. The episode was watched by 7.14 million viewers in the UK, and was given an [[Appreciation Index]] of 83. Though Graham received letters from children who enjoyed the episode, it did not generate a positive response from adult fans and critics. 

==Plot==
The [[TARDIS]] materialises on Dame [[Kelly Holmes]] [[Cul-de-sac|Close]] on the day of the opening ceremony of the [[2012 Olympic Games]].  The neighbourhood is preparing for the passing of the Olympic torch-bearer, but the mood has been destroyed by the inexplicable disappearances of several local children.  A council worker, Kel, also mentions that cars have been breaking down momentarily all day. [[Tenth Doctor|The Doctor]] and [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] investigate and realise that the source of the problems is a solitary 12-year old girl, Chloe Webber, who is able to cause people to disappear by drawing them. The Doctor hypnotises Chloe and finds that she is possessed by an immature [[Isolus]], an alien life-form used to travelling through space with a family of billions, which has crashed its pod to Earth due to a solar flare.  The Isolus relates and befriends Chloe, who had a troubled childhood, due to their mutual loneliness. The Isolus has also caused Chloe to draw a life-sized, exaggerated figure of her late, violent father, which briefly has become animated.

The Doctor explains that if they can find the Isolus pod and provide it power, the alien will leave Chloe. A frantic Chloe draws the TARDIS and the Doctor, trapping them both in one of her sketches, forcing Rose to try to find the pod herself. She rationalises that the pod is located on the hottest spot on the street, and is able to dig it up. With Chloe having already caused the entire crowd at the Olympic stadium to disappear and now intent on making everyone in the world disappear, Rose tries to find out how to power the pod. Thanks to visual indications from the Doctor's "picture", Rose understands that she needs to offer the pod heat mixed with emotional strength, which she does by throwing the pod towards the Olympic Torch.  As the missing children start to reappear, Rose realises that so will the [[demon]]-like drawing that Chloe had made of her father. Rose and Chloe's mother are able to calm Chloe enough and the (unseen) monster disappears.

As the torch-bearer approaches the Olympic Stadium, he staggers, but the Doctor completes the run and lights the Olympic Flame, allowing the Isolus to peacefully leave Chloe's body and return home. As the Doctor and Rose walk off to watch the Games, Rose remarks that however hard they attempt, nothing will ever split the two of them up. However, the Doctor becomes uneasy and surmises that [[Army of Ghosts|a storm is approaching]].

===Continuity===
The episode, with its stand-alone nature, has very few links to other episodes: [[Story arcs in Doctor Who#Torchwood|Torchwood]] is again mentioned, on the television by a news announcer.<ref>{{cite web|first=Alan|last=Kistler|url=http://www.newsarama.com/tv/definitive-doctor-who-timeline-2-110504.html|title=The Definitive Doctor Who, Torchwood, Sarah Jane Timeline 2|publisher=Newsrama|date=4 May 2011|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref> The Doctor invokes the [[Shadow Proclamation]] which was an intergalactic code used in "[[Rose (Doctor Who)|Rose]]" to gain an audience with the [[Nestene Consciousness]],<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[Rose (Doctor Who)|Rose]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director [[Keith Boak]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One]] | city = Cardiff | airdate = 26 March 2005}}</ref> and mentions that his dislike of [[cat]]s stems from "being threatened by one in a [[nun]]'s [[wimple]]", which occurred in "[[New Earth]]".<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[New Earth]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director [[James Hawes]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One]] | city = Cardiff | airdate = 15 April 2006}}</ref>

==Production==
===Writing===
The episode was an overcommissioned episode, which replaced a planned but unproduced script by [[Stephen Fry]].<ref name="Sullivan">{{Cite web

Graham stated in 2011 that they "set out to do right from the start" making the episode more aimed at children, rather than adults and older ''Doctor Who'' fans, as the much darker finale would be broadcast following it. Davies specifically asked Graham to write for his seven-year-old son.<ref name="Graham2011">{{cite web|first=Simon|last=Brew| url=http://www.denofgeek.com/television/891987/matthew_graham_interview_on_writing_doctor_who.html|title=Matthew Graham interview: on writing Doctor Who|publisher=Den of Geek|date=18 May 2011|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref> 

Graham originally suggested a story about a man who had the ability to drain Earth of its beauty, but Davies preferred his own idea about the eerie nature of paintings or illustration.<ref name="Sullivan" /> The Isolus was inspired by the villains in the 1978 film ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''.<ref name="Sullivan" /> Early drafts of this episode were titled "Chloe Webber Destroys the Earth", and later, "You're a Bad Girl, Chloe Webber",<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Arnopp | first = Jason | date = 19 July 2006 | title = TV Preview: Fear Her | journal = [[Doctor Who Magazine]]|publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent]]| | issue = 371 | pages = 25}}</ref> with one such draft having the episode take place on another planet.<ref name="insidestory">{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Gary|year=2006|title=Doctor Who: The Inside Story|location=London|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|ISBN=0-563-48639-X|page=230}}</ref> Both of these title were rejected by Davies as they were too long.<ref name="Sullivan" />

===Casting and filming===
[[File:Glanmor's Gap, Millennium Stadium, Cardiff.jpg|thumb|200px|The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff was used for the Olympic Stadium.]]
Dame [[Kelly Holmes]], who was mentioned in the episode, was considered for the part of the torchbearer, but was committed to ''[[Dancing On Ice]]'' at the time.<ref name="Sullivan" /> Nina Sosanya and Abdul Salis had both appeared in the film ''[[Love Actually]]''.<ref name="confidential desktop">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/confidential/index11.shtml|title=Confidential Desktop: Episode 11 - The Fright Stuff|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref> Abisola Agbaje, who portrayed Chloe, was discovered at an after-school drama club,<ref name="confidential desktop"/> where casting director Andy Pryor had done auditions for the part.<ref name="CBBC"/> Agbaje had to play both Cloe's normal character and her character while being possessed by the Isolus, which Agbaje felt was "weird".<ref name="CBBC">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_5090000/newsid_5098400/5098406.stm|title=Q&A: Abisola Agbaje|publisher=[[Newsround]]|date=22 June 2006|accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref> When performing as the Isolus she had to whisper, and an echoe was added in post-production. Agbaje found it "a bit hard to whisper" because she had a husky voice.<ref name="CBBC"/> A hand double for Agbaje drew the pictures, while the series' storyborder Shaun Williams drew the father in the cupboard.<ref name="confidential desktop" />

Due to Fry's script being dropped, production of some episodes of the second series had to be rescheduled, with "Fear Her" being produced alongside "[[The Idiot's Lantern]]". The episode was filmed during late January and early February 2006, with the cold temperatures experienced during filming being explained in the plot as part of the Isolus' [[endothermic]] nature. The majority of the episode, including exterior shots and Chloe's home, was filmed in the [[Tremorfa]] area of Cardiff, with a majority of the remainder filmed in the ''Doctor Who'' studios in [[Newport]].<ref name="Sullivan" /> A storage yard by the [[Rhymney River]] off Newport Road in Cardiff was used for the location the TARDIS lands in.<ref name="locations guide">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/tours/events/pages/doctorwho_s2e11.shtml?1|title=Fear Her Locations Guide|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref> The [[Millennium Stadium]] in Cardiff was used for the Olympic Stadium.<ref name="locations guide" />

==Broadcast and reception==
Overnight UK figures for the first broadcast of "Fear Her" was 6.6 million viewers, with a 39.7% audience share.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/news-archives.php?id=6-2006#newsitemEEVEFpElFEqRfhGYmB|title=Fear Her Overnights, Army of Ghosts Trailer|first=Shaun|last=Lyon|publisher=[[Outpost Gallifrey]]|date=25 June 2006|accessdate=7 April 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070323034233/http://www2.gallifreyone.com/news-archives.php?id=6-2006#newsitemEEVEFpElFEqRfhGYmB <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 23 March 2007}}</ref> Final consolidated ratings rose to 7.1 million.<ref name="Sullivan" /> The episode received an [[Appreciation Index]] of 83.<ref name="DWMComp">{{cite journal |date=9 November 2006 |Title =  |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]: Series Two Companion |issue=14 - Special Edition |pages=|publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent]]}}</ref>

Graham was happy with the episode himself and received letters from "loads of kids" who enjoyed it. When discovering that older fans had reacted negatively, he thought, "Well, it's a shame that they have, but it wasn't meant for them".<ref name="Graham2011" /> [[IGN]]'s Ahsan Haque gave the episode a 5 out of 10 rating, calling it "flat and formulaic" and everything about it was "slightly underwhelming", though he thought what did work was the mother-daughter teamwork at the end. He also noted "annoying self-aggrandizing moments that made no sense and served only to make the episode feel unnecessarily campy", such as the audience disappearing from the stadium and the Doctor carrying the torch. Comparing the episode to "[[The Idiot's Lantern]]" in terms of plot, he felt that the latter was "far more entertaining" and that "Fear Her" lacked originality and humor.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ahsan|last=Haque|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/751/751411p1.html|title=Doctor Who: "Fear Her" Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=18 December 2006|accessdate=11 February 2012}}</ref> Dave Bradley of ''[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]'' awarded "Fear Her" three out of five stars, describing the plot as "ordinary" but thought it was "a decent breather before grander adventures to come". He particularly praised the dialogue and thought "the claustrophobic effect of limiting the action to one household works".<ref>{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Bradley|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2006/06/25/doctor_who_2_11_fear_her/|title=Doctor Who 2.11 Fear Her|work=SFX|date=25 June 2006|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref>

In 2011, ''SFX'' published an article stating arguments for and against the episode. The "Defence" stated that, while some minor roles were played "broadly", Nina Sosanya and Abisola Agbaje were "extremely good", and opined that the unusual things happening in a typical housing estate and the lack of appearance from a monster were effective. The "Prosecution", on the other hand, described it as a "cheap filler" with a "cheesy" finale and called the lack of a monster a "severe disappointment".<ref>{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Golder|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2011/02/26/isn%E2%80%99t-it-about-time-you-gave-doctor-who%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cfear-her%E2%80%9D-another-chance/|title=Isn't It About Time You Gave Doctor Who's "Fear Her" Another Chance?|work=SFX|date=26 February 2011|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref> [[Topless Robot]] named it the third worst Tenth Doctor episode.<ref>{{cite web|first=Rob|last=Bricken|url=http://www.toplessrobot.com/2009/10/the_5_best_and_5_worst_david_tennant_doctor_who_ep.php?page=2|title=The 5 Best (and 5 Worst) David Tennant Doctor Who Episodes|publisher=[[Topless Robot]]|date=5 October 2009|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref> In a poll conducted by ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' in 2009 which asked readers to rank all 200 stories that had been released, "Fear Her" fell at 192 out of 200.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Mighty 200|journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]|publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent]]|issue=413|date=14 October 2009}}</ref>
