==History==
===First season===
{{Main|2008 Indian Premier League}}
[[Image:IPL T20 Chennai vs Kolkata.JPG|thumb|220 px|right|A [[Chennai Super Kings|Chennai]] vs [[Kolkata Knight Riders|Kolkata]] match in progress at the [[M.A. Chidambaram Cricket Stadium]]]]

The inaugural season of the tournament started on 18 April 2008 and lasted for 46 days with 59 matches scheduled, out of which 58 took place and 1 was washed out due to rain. The final was played in DY Patil Stadium, [[Nerul]], Navi Mumbai. Every team played each other both at home and away in a [[round robin]] system. The top four ranking sides progressed to the knockout stage of semi-finals followed by a final. [[Rajasthan Royals]] defeated [[Chennai Super Kings]] in a last ball thriller and emerged as the inaugural IPL champions.

===Second season===
{{Main|2009 Indian Premier League}}

The 2009 season coincided with the [[Indian general election, 2009|general elections]] in India. Owing to concerns regarding players' security, the venue was shifted to [[South Africa]]. The format of the tournament remained the same as the inaugural one. [[Deccan Chargers]], who finished last in the first season, came out as eventual winners defeating the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the final.

=== Third season===
{{Main|2010 Indian Premier League}}

The third season opened in January 2010 with the auction for players. 66 players were on offer but only 11 players were sold. In this season, defending Champions [[Deccan Chargers]] did not play at their preferred home location of [[Hyderabad District, India|Hyderabad]] or [[Visakhapatnam]] due to the ongoing political crisis in the region. The new bases for the champions this season were [[Nagpur]], [[Navi Mumbai]] and [[Cuttack]]. Four teams qualified for the semi-finals. The first semi-final was won by [[Mumbai Indians]] who defeated [[Bangalore Royal Challengers]] by 35 runs. [[Chennai Super Kings]] defeated [[Deccan Chargers]] in the second semi-final. The final was played between Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians. Chennai Super Kings won by a margin of 22 runs.

=== Fourth season===
{{Main|2011 Indian Premier League}}

On 21 March 2010, at Chennai it was announced that 2 new teams from [[Pune]] and [[Kochi, India|Kochi]] will be added to the IPL from next season. This will increase the number of franchises from 8 to 10 and the number of matches from 60 to 94 if the same format is used. However, the bid around the Kochi franchisee turned controversial resulting in the resignation of minister, [[Shashi Tharoor]] from the Central Government and investigations by various departments of the Government of India into the financial dealings of IPL and the other existing franchisees. Later, [[Lalit Modi]] was also removed from IPL chairmanship by BCCI.

== Franchises ==
The winning [[bidding|bidders]] for the eight [[professional sports league organization|franchises]] were announced on 24 January 2008.<ref>[http://cricket.indiatimes.com/The_great_IPL_auction_winners_declared/articleshow/2728231.cms The great IPL auction winners declared - News - News - Indiatimes Cricket<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> While the total base price for auction was US $400 million, the auction fetched US $723.59 million.<ref>[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ipl/content/current/story/333193.html Cricinfo - Big business and Bollywood grab stakes in IPL<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

On 21 March 2010, [[Pune]] and [[Kochi, India|Kochi]] were unveiled as the two new franchises for the fourth edition of the Indian Premier League. The base price was $225 million.  While Pune was bought by Sahara Adventure Sports Group for $370 million, the Kochi franchise was bought by Rendezvous Sports World Limited for $333.3 million. The process was to have been completed on March 7 but was postponed by two weeks after many bidders and the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]] objected to stiff financial clauses.<ref>[http://www.cricinfo.com/ipl2010/content/current/story/452856.html Pune and Kochi unveiled as new IPL franchises]</ref> The second franchise auction fetched total $703 million.

==Player signings==
{{Main|2008 Indian Premier League#Player auctions|2009 Indian Premier League#Pre-season trades and signings|2010 IPL Player Auction}}
 
The first players' auctions were held on 2008. The IPL placed [[Icon Player|icon status]] on a select few marquee Indian players. These players were [[Rahul Dravid]], [[Sachin Tendulkar]], [[Saurav Ganguly]], [[Yuvraj Singh]], and [[Virender Sehwag]]. [[VVS Laxman]] initially named an icon player, later voluntarily opted out of his icon status to give his team (Deccan Chargers) more money to bid for players.<ref>{{cite web|title=IPL players' auction to be held on 20 February
|url=http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/ipl/content/story/335706.html|publisher=Cricinfo}}</ref> For the second season, auctions were also held, but free signings taking place in the off-season by franchises led to calls for a [[draft (sports)|draft]]-like system where the lowest ranked teams would be given a first opportunity to sign players.

== Television rights and sponsorships ==
The IPL is predicted to bring the BCCI income of approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]1.6 billion, over a period of five to ten years.
All of these revenues are directed to a central pool, 40% of which will go to IPL itself, 54% to franchisees and 6% as prize money. The money will be distributed in these proportions until 2017, after which the share of IPL will be 50%, franchisees 45% and prize money 5%.
The IPL signed up [[Kingfisher Airlines]] as the official umpire partner for the series in a [[Indian rupee|Rs.]] 106 crore (approximately <U+00A3>15 million) deal. This deal sees the Kingfisher Airlines brand on all umpires' uniforms and also on the giant screens during [[third umpire]] decisions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/News_By_Industry/Transportation/Airlines__Aviation/Kingfisher_Airlines_named_IPLs_umpire_partner/articleshow/2884409.cms|title=Kingfisher Airlines named IPL's umpire partner|date=20 March 2008|publisher=[[The Economic Times]]|accessdate=2009-05-08}}</ref>

=== Television rights ===
On 15 January 2008 it was announced that a consortium consisting of [[India]]'s [[Sony Entertainment Television (India)|Sony Entertainment Television]] network and [[Singapore]]-based [[World Sport Group]] secured the global broadcasting rights of the Indian Premier League.<ref name = "IPL Broadcast Rights" >{{cite news|title=Sony and World Sports Group bag IPL television rights| url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ipl/content/current/story/330881.html | publisher=Cricinfo|date=2008-01-14| accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref> The record deal has a duration of ten years at a cost of US $1.026 billion. As part of the deal, the consortium will pay the BCCI US $918 million for the television broadcast rights and US $108 million for the promotion of the tournament.<ref>{{cite news|title=Billion dollar rights deal for IPL |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23054747-2722,00.html|publisher=The Australian|date=2008-01-15| accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref>
This deal was challenged in the Bombay High Court by IPL, and got the ruling on its side. After losing the battle in court, [[Sony Entertainment Television (India)|Sony Entertainment Television]] signed a new contract with BCCI with [[Sony Entertainment Television (India)|Sony Entertainment Television]] paying {{INRConvert|8700|c}} for 10 years. One of the reasons for payment of this huge amount is seen as the money required to subsidize IPL's move to South Africa which will be substantially more than the previous IPL. IPL had agreed to subsidize the difference in operating cost between India and South Africa as it decided to move to the African nation after the security concerns raised because of its coincidence with India's general elections. 

20% of these proceeds would go to IPL, 8% as prize money and 72% would be distributed to the franchisees. The money would be distributed in these proportions until 2012, after which the IPL would go public and list its shares (But recently in March 2010, IPL decided not to go public).<ref name="toirights">{{cite news|title=Does the IPL model make sense?|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-2734443,prtpage-1.cms|author=IndranilBasu|publisher=The Times of India|date=2008-01-27|accessdate=2008-03-21}}</ref>

Sony-WSG then re-sold parts of the broadcasting rights geographically to other companies. Below is a summary of the broadcasting rights around the world.

On 4 March 2010 ITV announced it had secured the United Kingdom television rights for the 2010 Indian Premier League. ITV will televise 59 of the 60 IPL matches on its ITV4 free to air channel.<ref>{{cite news|title=ITV to screen IPL in 2010 |url=http://www.itv.com/sport/ipl/default.html|publisher=ITV|date=2010-03-04}}</ref>

The UK-based brand consultancy, Brand Finance, has valued the IPL at {{INRConvert|18500|c}} in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/et-cetera/Stiff-clauses-leave-only-4-in-race-for-IPL-teams/articleshow/5648934.cms|title=Stiff clauses leave only 4 in race for IPL teams|publisher=The Economic Times|accessdate=9 March 2010}}</ref> It was valued at U$2.01 billion in 2009 by the same consultancy.<ref>[http://www.iplt20.com/news_detail.php?id=984&category=news Brand IPL touches the sky]. Iplt20.com</ref>

There are disputed figures for the profitability of the teams. One analyst said that four teams out of the eight made a profit in 2009.<ref>[http://www.livemint.com/2010/02/10235143/IPL-teams-become-hot-commodity.html IPL teams become hot commodity] LiveMint article</ref> While the London Times said that all but [[Kings XI Punjab]] made a profit.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/cricket/article7052966.ece Lalit Modi ambition could create problems for IPL franchises]</ref>

In 2010, the IPL expects to have 80 official merchandising deals. It has signed a deal with [[Switzerland|Swiss]] watchmaker Bandelier to make official watches for the IPL.<ref>[http://www.indiantelevision.com/mam/headlines/y2k10/mar/marmam18.php IPL targets 80 licensing and merchandising deals this year]</ref>

According to a recent study by a UK-based brand valuation consultancy, the brand value of the IPL has more than doubled to USD 4.13 billion (over Rs 18,000 crore) from USD 2.01 billion in 2009.<ref>http://www.iplt20.com/news_detail.php?id=984&category=news</ref>

The franchises have been a part of this growth. Chennai Super Kings, who were ranked fourth last year, has emerged the most valued franchise in 2010. The CSK franchise has moved up the ladder to number one with a valuation of USD 48.4 million. The Kolkata Knight Riders co-owned by Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan comes in second with a valuation of USD 46 million and the Rajasthan Royals, co-owned by Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty comes in third with USD 45.2 million.
The Royal Challengers Bangalore, owned by Vijay Mallya, is ranked fourth with a valuation of USD 41.9 million and is followed by the Mumbai Indians (USD 40.8 million), Delhi Daredevils (USD 40.5 million) and Kings XI Punjab ( USD 36.1 million). The Deccan Chargers are at the base with a valuation of USD 34.4 million.<ref>http://www.iplt20.com/news_detail.php?id=984&category=news</ref>

== Global following ==
{{Refimprovesect|date=March 2010}}
In India, the IPL has become one of the most popular events of the year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtvcricket/showstory.aspx?id=SPOEN20090082651|title=All about the Indian Premier League (IPL)|date=2009-02-05|publisher=[[NDTV]]|accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref>. In the first season, games were played every night (including weekdays) during Indian [[prime-time]] and were broadcast live. The IPL was the most watched TV program in India.

IPL drew positive reactions from the rest of the world also. In [[Pakistan]], the reception was described as "massive". The matches were telecast live in [[GEO Super]].  The matches also generated interest in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Bangladesh]], despite only one Bangladeshi player being involved. The following in the  subcontinental nations was aided by the prime time telecast of the matches as they belong to adjacent time zones.

The [[IPL]] became a big hit in [[South Africa]] due to a large composition of South Asians in their population.Another reason for the success is that the second edition of IPL was hosted at [[South Africa]] drawing massive crowds from the country as well as the other countries in the subcontinent.

The IPL did not garner much interest in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] due to time differences. However, in recent times the IPL has gained a much larger fan-base in these two countries. 

Snap polls indicated that more than 48 million people watched the telecast of the IPL 2008 final between [[Rajasthan Royals]] and [[Chennai Super Kings]], more than 40 million people saw the Rajasthan Royals vs Delhi Daredevils match, whereas the second semi-final between Chennai Super Kings and Kings XI Punjab attracted an audience of 29 million.<ref>[http://www.india-server.com/news/about-24-million-watched-ipl-final-1605.html About 24 Million Watched IPL Final]</ref>

The third season of IPL saw interest rise dramatically in the [[United Kingdom]]. This was, in part, due to TV coverage switching to free to view channel [[ITV4]]. Previous editions of IPL were aired on the now defunct channel [[Setanta]] (pay to view channel), which entered administration in 2009. James Macleod stated, "We are delighted with the viewing figures for the IPL so far. The ratings for ITV4s coverage have been around seven or eight times those achieved by Setanta last year, and we're delighted to be bringing the competition to a wider audience". Lalit Modi, former Chairman and Commissioner of IPL, also expressed immense satisfaction on the way IPL has been accepted by the British audience. "ITV beats Sky Sports over the weekend in number of viewers. This is great going. The ITV numbers are double that of rugby league. This is huge by all imaginations. UK figures for viewership on ITV already 10 times that of last year. This is just fantastic news," he said.<ref>[http://chaisamosa.net/index.php/latest-news/201003252102/ipl-devours-british-tv-ratings/menu-id-363html IPL devours British TV ratings]</ref><ref>[http://www.iplt20.com/news_detail.php?id=958 Record ratings for IPL in the UK].

== Rules ==

There are five ways that a franchise can acquire a player. In the annual auction, buying domestic players, signing uncapped players, through trading and buying replacements.<ref name="Acquiring Players">[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ipl2009/content/current/story/387453.html Slow trading with all eyes on auction], Brief discussion of IPL rules on acquiring players.</ref><ref name="Replacement Players">[http://cricketnext.in.com/news/ipl-lays-down-guidelines-for-replacements/37769-13.html IPL lays down guidelines for replacements], Discusses IPL rules on buying replacement players players.</ref> In the trading window the player can only be traded with his consent. The franchise will have to pay the difference between the old contract price and the new contract price. If the new contract is worth more than the older one then the difference will be shared between the player and the franchise selling the player.<ref name="IPL Trading">[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/374805.html IPL rules when trading players]. Cricinfo.com</ref>

Some of the Team composition rules are:

* Minimum squad strength of 16 players plus one physio and a coach.
* No more than 8 foreign players in the squad and at most 4 in the playing XI.For the 2009 edition franchises are allowed 10 foreign players in the squad. The number allowed in the playing XI remains unchanged at 4.
* As this is domestic cricket so minimum of 8 local players must be included in each squad.
* A minimum of 2 players from the BCCI under-22 pool in each squad.

Some of the differences to international Twenty20 cricket:

* A difference to international cricket is a timeout. It gives the players an opportunity to strategise and take a drink during the strict 2 minutes, 30 seconds time limit. Each team is awarded two timeouts per innings totalling to four timeouts for the whole game. The teams can take the timeout when instructed, but is necessary to take it at the end of 9th and 16th over.
* IPL is also known for having commercials during the game, hence there is no time limit for teams to complete their innings. However, there may be a penalty if the umpires find teams misusing this privilege at their own choice.

The total spending cap for a franchisee in the first player auction was US $5 million. Under-22 players are to be remunerated with a minimum annual salary of US $20,000 while for others it is US $50,000. The most expensive players in the IPL to date are [[Andrew Flintoff]] and [[Kevin Pietersen]] at US $1.55 million each.
