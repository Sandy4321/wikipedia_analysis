The '''thirteenth season''' of '''''[[South Park]]''''', an American animated television comedy series, originally aired in the United States on [[Comedy Central]] between March 11 and November 18, 2009. The season was headed by the series creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], who served as [[executive producer]]s along with Anne Garefino. The season continued to focus on the exploits of protagonists [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] in the fictional [[Colorado]] mountain town of South Park.

The season was the first of three new seasons Parker and Stone agreed to produce for the network under a renewal deal. It consisted of fourteen 22-minute episodes, which aired in two groups of seven episodes separated by a six-month gap. Prior to the season's premiere, all ''South Park'' episodes were made available for free viewing on the official series website, ''South Park Studios''. The thirteenth season was the first to be broadcast in [[High-definition television|high definition]] and in widescreen. Continuing their practice from previous seasons, Parker and Stone wrote and produced each episode within the week before its broadcast date.

The thirteenth season satirized such topics as the [[ACORN 2009 undercover videos controversy|ACORN scandal]], [[Whaling in Japan|Japanese whaling]], [[piracy in Somalia]] and the marketing tactics of the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Company]]. Celebrities were spoofed throughout the season, including the [[Jonas Brothers]], [[Kanye West]], [[Carlos Mencia]], [[Paul Watson]] and [[Glenn Beck]], all of whom publicly responded to their portrayals. The episode "[[Fishsticks (South Park)|Fishsticks]]" attracted particular media attention due to rapper Kanye West's declaration that its jokes about his arrogance were funny but hurt his feelings. "[[The F Word (South Park)|The F Word]]", in which the central characters attempt to change the definition of the word "[[faggot (slang)|fag]]", was especially controversial and prompted complaints from the [[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]]. A broadcast of "[[Pinewood Derby (South Park)|Pinewood Derby]]" in Mexico was pulled, allegedly due to its depiction of [[President of Mexico|Mexican President]] [[Felipe Calder<U+00F3>n]]. "[[Fatbeard]]" was praised by the crew of the [[USS Bainbridge (DDG-96)|USS ''Bainbridge'']], which was involved in the [[Maersk Alabama hijacking|2009 rescue]] of the [[MV Maersk Alabama|MV ''Maersk Alabama'']] from Somalian pirates.

The thirteenth season received mixed reviews: some critics called it one of ''South Park''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s strongest seasons, while others claimed the series was starting to decline in quality. The season maintained the average [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] viewership for the series, around 3&nbsp;million viewers per episode. The episode "[[Margaritaville (South Park)|Margaritaville]]", which satirized the [[Late-2000s recession|global recession]] then affecting much of the industrialized world, won the 2009 [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)|Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)]].

Kyle tries to explain to Cartman that he had no role in writing the joke, but his ego is so big that he subconsciously remembers things incorrectly. Cartman comes to the exact opposite conclusion, believing Jimmy is the one with the twisted ego who is trying to steal credit from him. Meanwhile, comedian [[Carlos Mencia]] claims credit for the joke and rapper [[Kanye West]] is mocked for not understanding it. Convinced he is a genius, West will not allow anyone to explain the joke to him, and in his anger he beats Mencia to death. Later he has an epiphany about his own massive ego, but misinterprets the joke to mean that he is a gay fish, which he embraces by making a music video about it.

The people of Earth were being tested to determine whether they were worthy to join the intergalactic community. Having failed, the Earth is forever isolated from the rest of the universe as punishment.

 |ShortSummary = The boys go on a trip to the water park, where Cartman is distraught to discover that many people from [[minority group]]s are in attendance. Cartman calculates there will be no white people left by the year 2012, which he believes is in accordance with the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]]s' prediction of [[2012 phenomenon|the end of the world]]. Meanwhile, Kyle is disgusted to learn that most people freely urinate in the pools. The park owner refuses to close and evacuate the park after tests show that its water is 98&nbsp;percent urine. Consequently overcome by urine [[tsunami]]s, the park is quarantined. Rescue operations are delayed until an antidote is found for the "pee contamination" that is believed to have turned the survivors inside into mutants. Cartman finds himself in an inflatable raft where he is the only white person, prompting him to think that the 2012 scenario occurred three years early, and that he is the last of his kind. Kyle, who refused to get into the pee-infested water all day, has to drink urine before he can reach an emergency release valve. However, much to his annoyance, they are rescued immediately afterward.

===Development===
''South Park'' was set to expire in 2008, but in August 2007 it was announced the series would be renewed for at least three more seasons, extending it through 2011.  The new seasons, thirteen, [[South Park (season 14)|fourteen]] and fifteen, were each to consist of fourteen episodes. Stone said of the announcement, "Three more years of ''South Park'' will give us the opportunity to offend that many more people."<ref name="IGN0827">{{Cite web |title=South Park Gets Three More Seasons |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=August 27, 2007 |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/816/816143p1.html |accessdate=February 16, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5u4nzdC1W |archivedate=November 7, 2010}}</ref><ref name="CC0827">{{Cite news |title="South Park" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone agree to three-year extension of "South Park" and form comprehensive production and development joint venture with Comedy Central to create South Park Digital Studios |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/press/press_releases/2007/082707_southpark_extension_jv.jhtml |publisher=[[Comedy Central]] |date=August 27, 2007 |accessdate=February 16, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5u4oLPeNb |archivedate=November 7, 2010}}</ref> Parker and Stone also announced they would partner with Comedy Central to create a Los Angeles<U+2013>based digital animation studio called South Park Digital Studios, which would serve as the center for all digital extensions of the ''South Park'' franchise and other animated projects.<ref name="IGN0827" />

Prior to the broadcast of the thirteenth season, Parker and Stone made every episode from the previous twelve seasons of ''South Park'' available for free viewing on the official series website, ''South Park Studios''. New episodes from the thirteenth season were made available for one week after the original airdate, then removed for thirty days, after which they were returned to the site permanently. The episodes were uncensored and ad-supported, so no membership fees were required to view the shows. In a statement, Parker and Stone said, "We got really sick of having to download our own show illegally all the time.

===Writing===
Continuing their practice from previous seasons, Parker and Stone wrote and produced each episode within the week before its broadcast date, although as in previous seasons, only Trey Parker was listed as writer in the end credits. The duo conceived a list of episode ideas at the start of the season, but said they preferred to wait until the last minute to start working. Deadline pressure, they explained, energized them as if they were doing a live show. Stone said of the practice, "We kind of need that [chaos] to work.

{{Quote box |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right |width=220px |align=right | quote  = From knocking celebrities off their high horse, to tackling social issues, to just plain pointing out the ridiculous nature of our every day lives, ''South Park'' Season 13 had more cultural impact than most animated series could ever dream of. Sure, it wasn't always great, and previous seasons have been better, but the series sure is doing well for its age. | source = <U+2014> Ramsley Isler, [[IGN]]<ref name="IGN1125" />}}
Ramsey Isler of [[IGN]] said ''South Park'' continued to be the "best animated comedy show on TV" during its thirteenth season. He said the season had some low points, particularly "Eat, Pray Queef", but that episodes like "The F Word" and "Dances with Smurfs" delivered significant social commentary. Isler described "Fishsticks" as a well-timed, hilarious episode that became a "phenomenon".<ref name="IGN1125">{{Cite web |last=Isler |first=Ramsey |title=South Park: Season 13 Review |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/104/1049514p1.html |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=November 25, 2009 |accessdate=February 18, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5u4sfEDbk |archivedate=November 7, 2010}}</ref> Ben Flanagan of ''The Tuscaloosa News'' said the thirteenth season was one of the strongest yet for ''South Park'', and that the series continued its tradition of entertainingly combining gross-out comedy with social satire.

Not all reviews of the season were positive. [[The A.V. Club|A.V.

===Awards===
Parker and Stone decided to submit "Margaritaville" for an [[Emmy Award]] because they had received a large amount of positive feedback about the episode from adult viewers. Since most Emmy voters are older, they decided "Margaritaville" stood the best chance of winning. Stone joked, "If an Emmy voter were to watch this, they might think the show was smarter than it was, so they might be fooled into voting for us."<ref>{{Cite video | people=[[Matt Stone|Stone, Matt]]| date=November 2010 |title=South Park: The Complete Thirteenth Season: "Margaritaville" |format=Audio commentary |medium=Blu-ray Disc|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|ParamountHome Entertainment]]}}</ref> "Margaritaville" ultimately won the 2009 Emmy Award for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)|Outstanding Animated Program for Programming Less Than One Hour]] against competing nominees ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[American Dad]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |work=[[Emmy Award|Emmys.com]] |date=July 16, 2009 |accessdate=February 20, 2010 |url=http://www.emmys.com/category/nomination-category/outstanding-animated-program-programming-less-one-hour?page=4 |title=Outstanding Animated Program (for programming less than one hour |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5u4svFdGK |archivedate=November 7, 2010)}}</ref> The victory marked the third consecutive Emmy win for ''South Park'', which won in the same category in 2007 for the [[South Park (season 10)|tenth season]] episode "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]", and won the award for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming One Hour or More)|Outstanding Animated Program for Programming One Hour or More]] for the [[South Park (season 11)|eleventh season]] episode "[[Imaginationland Episode I|Imaginationland]]".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tina Fey, Justin Timberlake Among Big Creative Arts Winners |date=September 12, 2009 |publisher=[[Emmy Award|Emmys.com]] |url=http://www.emmys.com/articles/hbo-tops-2009-creative-arts-emmys-nbc-leads-nets |accessdate=February 20, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5u4t17IyX |archivedate=November 7, 2010}}</ref> Parker, Stone, Agnone, Stough, Beard, Howell, Rivinoja, Chatman, Hader and Quincy were all recipients of the Emmy.<ref name="EmmyWinners" />
