'''Wade Walker''' is an American former football player, coach, and university administrator. He played [[college football]] as a [[tackle (American football)|tackle]] at the [[University of Oklahoma]] under head coaches [[Jim Tatum]] and [[Bud Wilkinson]]. Walker was named an all-conference player all four years and a first-team All-American in 1949. He served as the head football coach at [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State]] for six years from 1956 to 1961 and compiled a 22<U+2013>32<U+2013>2 record. He also served as the [[athletic director]] at Mississippi State and Oklahoma.

==College career==
Walker was born in [[Mocksville, North Carolina]],<ref name=four>Harold Keith, [http://books.google.com/books?id=h5Oo09wtdqoC ''47 Straight: The Wilkinson Era at Oklahoma''], p. 22, University of Oklahoma Press, 2003, ISBN 0806135697.</ref> and attended college at the [[University of Oklahoma]]. He played for the [[Oklahoma Sooners football]] team as a [[tackle (American football)|tackle]] from 1946 to 1949,<ref name=ou/> and he served as the team captain for two seasons.<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=jpehWR53e7AC Football Feuds: The Greatest College Football Rivalries]'', p. 70, Globe Pequot, 2007, ISBN 1599210142.</ref> Walker was part of the [[1946 Oklahoma Sooners football team|1946]] recruiting class<U+2014>brought to [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]] by one-year head coach [[Jim Tatum]]<U+2014>that included nine future All-Americans.<ref>[http://www.oufoundation.org/sm/spring08/story.asp?ID=284 The Forgotten Man of Oklahoma Football: Jim Tatum], ''Sooner Magazine'', University of Oklahoma Foundation, Spring 2008.</ref> In 1947, Tatum's former assistant [[Bud Wilkinson]] had taken over as head coach but by midseason the team was struggling with a 2<U+2013>2 record. In an effort to evoke player leadership, he told the team to elect two co-captains to serve the remainder of the season, and they chose Walker and the previous season's honor captain, [[Jim Tyree]].<ref>Keith, p. 29.</ref> In 1948, the [[International News Service]] named Walker as the right tackle on its All-Midlands team.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19481127&id=ErgKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EU4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4819,3472563 Oklahoma Places Six on All-Midlands Team], ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', November 27, 1948.</ref>

In [[1949 Oklahoma Sooners football team|1949]], Walker was named a first-team All-American by the [[Associated Press]], [[American Football Coaches Association]] (as a [[guard (American football)|guard]]), [[Football Writers Association of America]], and [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]].<ref>''ESPN College Football Encyclopedia'', p. 1214, Hyperion: ESPN Books, 2005, ISBN 1-4013-3703-1.</ref> He is one of just three Sooners to have been named an all-conference player each of his four years.<ref name=ou>[http://www.soonersports.com/sports/m-footbl/archive/aa-wade-walker-1949.html All-American: Wade Walker], Oklahoma University, retrieved June 17, 2009.</ref> In ''47 Straight: The Wilkinson Era at Oklahoma'', author Harold Keith describes Walker as a "finesse player" who eschewed hip pads and wore low-top backfield shoes to reduce the weight of his equipment. Teammate and fellow All-American [[Stan West]] said of Walker:<ref name=four/><blockquote>"I had the reputation of being the laziest man of all in our calisthenics drills, but I was chain lightning compared to him. 'Lord,' Wade used to say, 'you get warm enough out here anyhow.'"</blockquote>

In the [[1947 NFL Draft]], Walker was selected in the 22nd round as the 201st overall pick by the [[Chicago Cardinals]].<ref>[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/crd/1947_draft.htm 1947 Chicago Cardinals Draftees], Pro Football Reference, retrieved June 17, 2009.</ref>

==Coaching and administrative career==
In 1950, Walker worked as an assistant football coach at [[NC State Wolfpack football|NC State]].<ref>[http://images.lib.ncsu.edu:8180/luna/servlet/detail/NCSULIB~102~3~100389213~233825:NC-State-football-coach-Wade-Walker?qvq=w4s:/what/Football.+Players,+Q-Z/where/United+States+--+North+Carolina+--+Wake+County+--+Raleigh/;lc:NCSULIB~102~3,NCSULIB~1~1,NCSULIB~2~2,SCDRLUNA-VC~102~3&mi=23&trs=43 NC State football coach Wade Walker], Special Collections Research Center, NCSU Libraries, North Carolina State University, retrieved June 17, 2009.</ref> The following year, Walker served as an assistant football coach with the [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech Red Raiders]] from 1951-1953 prior to his arrival at Mississippi State.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/text/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2010FBmediasupplement.pdf |title=2010 Texas Tech Red Raiders Football Media Guide |publisher=[[Texas Tech University]] |page=68 |location=[[Lubbock, Texas]] |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> Walker was an assistant coach with the Bulldogs from 1954-1955 before serving as [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State]]'s head football coach and athletic director from 1956 to 1961. Walker compiled a 22<U+2013>32<U+2013>2 record over his 6 season tenure.<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/CFHSN/CFHSNv07/CFHSNv07n4a.pdf Charles "Bud" Wilkinson] (PDF), College Football Historical Society Newsletter, Vol. VII, No. II, August 1994.</ref><ref>[http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_year_by_year.php?coachid=2421 Wade Walker Records by Year], College Football Data Warehouse, retrieved June 17, 2009.</ref> The Mississippi State Maroons (now known as the Bulldogs) posted a lackluster 2<U+2013>7<U+2013>1 record in 1959. The following year, Walker's team improved to 5-5, but students and alumni demanded his ouster. University president [[Dean W. Colvard]] relented and fired Walker as football coach, but kept him on as athletic director.<ref name=maroon>Michael B. Ballard, [http://books.google.com/books?id=65J5gDduWJ4C ''Maroon and White: Mississippi State University, 1878-2003''], p. 144, University Press of Mississippi, 2008, ISBN 1578069998.</ref>

In 1963, the [[Mississippi State Bulldogs men's basketball|Mississippi State basketball team]] won the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) championship and advanced to the second round of the [[1963 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]]. They were set to face [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola of Chicago]], an integrated school, but Mississippi state schools had an unwritten prohibition against playing teams with black players. In violation of a court [[injunction]] that prohibited the team from leaving the state, Colvard ordered the athletic department staff, including Walker and head basketball coach [[Babe McCarthy]], across state lines to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. An assistant coach smuggled the team out of the state from a private airfield, and they met Walker and the rest of the staff before flying to Michigan to play Loyola. Mississippi State lost, 61<U+2013>51, but returned home without further incident. Walker said, "There I was, acting like a fugitive and running from the law because I was doing something I believed was right."<ref name=si>[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066745/index.htm Another Blow To Jim Crow], ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', November 18, 1987.</ref>

Mississippi State football fared poorly again in 1966, and Walker and his replacement as head football coach, [[Paul E. Davis]], both resigned.<ref name=maroon/> Walker returned to Oklahoma after 1969 to become the school's athletic director, and he served in that position until 1986.<ref name=ou/> In 1987, Walker had moved to [[La Quinta, California]] and was working for the Landmark Land Company.<ref name=si/>
