'''Offutt Field''' is a multi-purpose athletic field, located in [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania]]. It is currently used by the [[Greensburg-Salem School District]] and [[Seton Hill University]], primarily as a [[American football|football]] field. The stadium was called '''Athletic Park''', until 1928 when Greensburg-Salem renamed it. Despite popular belief, the school named the field after John Offutt, a community leader and school director. The district did not name the field after the Offutt family, who donated the land to the school.<ref name="Name">{{cite news|first=Rich|last=Emert|title=There's a story behind monikers for high school stadiums|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=20050818&id=ZIdIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DXEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6811,5269867|page=EZ8, EZ10|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''|date=August 18, 2005}}</ref> The [[Greensburg Athletic Association]], which was one of the earliest professional football teams, played their home games at the stadium from 1890-1900.

==History==
===Pro football===
The field was the home of the Greensburg Athletic Association, a professional football team during the 1890s.  The field's playing surface once had a stream, known as Jacob's Run, which crossed a corner of the field.<ref name="Creek">{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Van Atta|title=In early 1800s, several companies constructed a network of turnpikes|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'' |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_108714.html|date=December 22, 2002}}</ref> Early-day accounts of football games at Athletic Park noted that the football occasionally went into the creek, and players became heroes with the crowd for plunging into the waters to retrieve the ball.<ref>{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Van Atta|title=Beavers built dam near routes 119 and 30|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]''|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/specialreports/s_507443.html|date=May 13, 2007}}</ref> On October 26, 1895, during a game between Greensburg and the Carnegie Athletic Club of Braddock, once Greensburg scored a [[touchdown]] after only a minute and a half into the game, some spectators at Athletic Park were, according to news reports at time, were <U+201C>so hilarious over the rout that they threw their hats in the air and some went in the creek<U+201D> that ran past a corner of the field.<ref name="PFRA">{{cite journal | title=The History of Pro Football At Greensburg, Pennsylvania (1894-1900) | journal=Coffin Corner | publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association | volume= | issue=Annual | year=1983 | pages=1&ndash;14 | url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/05-An-165.pdf | authors=Van Atta, Robert}}</ref> In 1916, the field level was raised and the creek covered.<ref name="Creek"/> Jacob's Run is a part of [[Jacobs Creek (Pennsylvania)|Jacob's Creek]].<ref name="Jacobs">{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Van Atta|title=Bridge across Jacobs Creek was world's first iron suspension bridge|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]''|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/specialreports/s_71695.html#ixzz1oRNH8cMe|date=May 19, 2002}}</ref>

The field saw a memorable game that ended in a scoreless draw on November 24, 1894, between Greensburg and the [[Jeannette Athletic Club]]. During the first half of the game Greensburg's [[Lawson Fiscus]] got into a violent altercation (which was very common in this era) with an unknown Jeannette player. Several accounts of the incident describe Fiscus kicking the Jeannette player in the face. However the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' reported that Fiscus had tripped the player and "purposely tramped on his neck." Either way, Jeannette immediately  petitioned the referee to expel Fiscus from the game, meanwhile Greensburg defended Fiscus' actions. The arguments continued through to the second half of the game. Finally, either Jeannette or Greensburg stormed off the field in protest and the game was declared a scoreless draw.<ref name="PFRA"/> Another memorable professional game occured at the field on Saturday, October 12, 1895, the Greensburg Athletic Association defeated Western University of Pennsylvania (renamed the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1909), 42-2. In this era of football, it was common for college and professional teams to play each other. During this game it was discovered that Western University's coach gave his players a set of signals, which were commonly used in pre-huddle football days, that had been used by [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] the year before. Two of the key players of the Greensburg team had starred for Penn State the year before, one of which was player-coach [[Charlie Atherton]]. Thus, the team knew what the play was prior to the snap.<ref name="Creek"/>

The field is still used today by professional football teams. Currently the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], of the [[National Football League]] use the field for pre-season scrimmages.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fast Facts About Steelers Training Camp|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]''|url= http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/steelers/s_204813.html|date=July 25, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Mario|last=Sciullo|title=Steelers bring the crowds to Saint Vincent College|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''|url=http://wwww.postgazette.com/pg/09218/988757-55.stm#ixzz1oRlAcqvm|date=August 6, 2009}}</ref>

===Baseball===
In the summer of 1936, the [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[St. Louis Cardinals]], behind [[Pepper Martin]], defeated their Class D [[Pennsylvania State Association]] farm team, the [[Greensburg Red Wings]], 11-0, in front of 1,500 spectators at Offutt Field.<ref>{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Van Atta|title=This Date in History|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]''|date=August 13, 2000}}</ref> In 1937, [[Greensburg Green Sox]] minor league baseball team was instrumental in getting funds for lights at Offutt Field in the city, setting the stage for night high school football, which debuted that fall. <ref>{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Van Atta|title=

===College===
In 2005, Greensburg-Salem School District and Seton Hill College agreed to a 10-year lease in which the College will pay $35,000 to the school district each year for the right to play its home games at Offutt Field. Seton Hill has guaranteed the total amount of the lease, meaning it will be paid to the district even if the college finds another home field during its run.<ref>{{cite news|first=Scott|last=Robertson|title=PG East: Venerable Greensburg stadium gets facelift|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05202/540768-139.stm|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''|date=July 21, 2005}}</ref>

===High school===
The field has been used by Greensburg High School and Salem High School since 1894. The two districts merged in 1960 to form Greensburg-Salem School District. From 1960 until 1993, [[Greensburg Central Catholic High School]] played their home games at the stadium.<ref name="PFRA"/>
