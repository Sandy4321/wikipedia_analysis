==History and classification==
''Phasmagyps'' is known from a single fragmentary fossil bone, the [[holotype]] housed in the paleontology collections of the [[Colorado Museum of Natural History]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]] and given the number 1078.<ref name="Wetmore1927"/>  In 1923 Philip Reinheinter collected the specimen from the [[Weld County]] ''Trigonias'' quarry, possibly a fossilized watering hole.  The quarry worked sedimentary rocks that are positioned approximately {{convert|25|ft|m}} above the contact between the [[Pierre Shale]] and the [[Chadron Formation]], thus dating the fossils to the [[Chadronian|Lower Chadronian]].  The fossil was first studied by the American paleontologist and ornithologist [[Alexander Wetmore]]; his 1927 [[Type (biology)|type description]] of the new genus and species was published in the journal ''Proceedings of the Colorado Museum of Natural History''.  In the description, Wetmore did not give any [[etymology|etymological]] explanations for the genus and species names, though ''phasma'' is Latin and Greek for a phantom or apparition and ''[[Gyps]]'' identifies the genus as a vulture.  The fossil was reexamined in the early 1980s by avian paleontologist [[Storrs L. Olson]]. In a 1985 paper he gives a brief comment on the genus. He stated without going into specific details, that while the fossil is superficially similar to those of Cathartidae members, however it possesses notable features which are different and as such he regarded the position of the genus as problematic.<ref name="Olson1985"/>  In their 2005 description of a Peruvian fossil, Marcelo Stucchi and Steven Emslie noted the disputed nature of ''Phasmagyps'', but maintained the placement in Cathartidae and noted the genus as the oldest member of the family in the Americas.<ref name="Stucchi2005"/>

==Description==
When first described by Wetmore, ''Phasmagyps'' was described as being one third larger than the modern [[Black vulture]], ''Coragyps atratus''.  This is contradicted by James Ducey's 1992 paper which lists ''Phasmagyps'' as being "not much larger then the Black Vulture".<ref name="Ducey1992">{{cite journal |last1=Ducey |first1=J. |year=1992 |title=Fossil Birds of the Nebraska Region |journal= Transactions of the Nebraska Academy of Sciences and Affiliated Societies |volume=XIX |pages=83-96 |url=http://people.uncw.edu/emslies/research/Stucchi%20and%20Emslie%20Condor%202005.pdf}}</ref>  The single known fossil is a partial upper leg bone, specifically the lower section of the right [[tibiotarsus]].  As preserved, the largest diameter of the bone is {{convert|17.9|mm|in}} around the  [[Condyle (anatomy)|outer condyle]], and the width across the condyles is {{convert|14.9|mm|in}}.  The diameter at the smallest area of the preserved bone shaft is {{convert|9.2|mm|in}}.<ref name="Wetmore1927"/>
