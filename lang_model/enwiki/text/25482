The '''Hong Kong Marathon''', sponsored by [[Standard Chartered|Standard Chartered Bank]], is an annual [[marathon]] race held in February or March in [[Hong Kong]]. In addition to the full [[marathon]], a 10&nbsp;km run and a [[half marathon]] are also held. Around 70,000 runners take part each year across all events.

High levels of humidity and a difficult course make finishing times for the Hong Kong Marathon comparatively slower than other large marathons. The course records were both set in 2012 by Ethiopians: [[Dejere Abera]] has the men's record of 2:11:27 hours while [[Misiker Demissie]] holds the women's record of 2:30:12 hours.<ref>Butcher, Pat (2012-02-05).

Hong Kong Marathon was first granted as '''[[IAAF Road Race Label Events|IAAF Bronze Label Road Races]]''' by [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) in Year 2012 race, and it was upgraded as '''IAAF Silver Label Road Races''' in Year 2013 race,<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/competition/calendar/marathon-and-road-races/iaaf-silver-label-road-races IAAF Silver Label Road Races], IAAF Official Website, Retrieved on 2013-02-21</ref> and continued to keep this rating in Year 2014 race.

The Hong Kong Marathon has hosted the [[Asian Marathon Championship]] race on three occasions (2002, 2008 and 2013),<ref name=ARRS/><ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/competition/calendar/area-official-competitions/asian-marathon-championships 14th Asian Marathon Championships], IAAF Official Website, Retrieved on 2013-02-21</ref>

==History==
The race traces its history back to 1981, when it was launched as the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Marathon by the [[Hong Kong Amateur Athletic Association]]. The route was between [[Sheung Shui]] and [[Shenzhen]].<ref name="exhibition">Exhibition on marathon in Victoria Park, February 2008, by the organizer of the Marathon</ref> The race endured organisational difficulties due to a lack of funding and was not held from 1989 to 1991. After two further editions, the race was again suspended from 1994 to 1996.<ref name=ARRS>Civai, Franco (2011-03-11). [http://arrs.net/HP_HKgMa.htm Hong Kong Marathon].

The 1998 marathon established a new course, starting at [[Tsing Ma Bridge]] and ending at the newly finished [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on [[Chek Lap Kok]]. The total entrants increased to 6,000 participants. For 1999, the race was moved to urban areas for the first time, starting in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], ending at [[Sham Shui Po Sports Ground]], with 7,000 participants. The route was altered again in 2000, as it started from [[Hong Kong Cultural Centre]], [[Tsim Sha Tsui]], and ended at the Sham Shui Po Sports Ground. The half-marathon was added, alongside with the already-existing full marathon and 10&nbsp;km race.<ref name="exhibition"/>

[[Image:HK Marathon06.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Hong Kong Marathon in 2006, taken on [[West Kowloon Highway]] at [[Olympic Station]]. Significant air pollution was observed on that day.]]

In 2001 the number of participants exceeded 10,000. The race course started from [[Nathan Road]], then out to [[West Kowloon]], onto [[West Kowloon Highway]], followed by [[Cheung Tsing Tunnel]], [[Tsing Ma Bridge]], [[Ting Kau Bridge]], then going all the way back into [[Western Harbour Crossing]], ending at [[Golden Bauhinia Square|Golden Bauhina Plaza]] in [[Wan Chai North]].<ref name="exhibition"/>

The race was incorporated as one of the four legs of the Standard Chartered-sponsored The [[The Greatest Race on Earth|Greatest Race on Earth]] in 2005.

In 2006 the marathon was held on 12 February, with a prize fund of US$100,000. Almost 40,000 joined the Marathon. Two fainted during the race and one died on 14 February, resulting in the competition's first fatality. Reflecting this, first-aid services were introduced for the 2007 edition, but weather conditions seriously affected the runners. A record-breaking number of 6249 participants took part, 16.7% of whom experienced injury. Hot weather sent 35 participants to hospital, including one young runner who died.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://hk.news.yahoo.com/070304/12/22ybm.html|title=<U+8FEB><U+7206><U+99AC><U+62C9><U+677E> <U+9752><U+5E74><U+4E2D><U+6691><U+5371><U+6B86> 6249<U+4EBA><U+4E0D><U+9069>|publisher=<U+660E><U+5831>|date=2007-03-04}}</ref>

===2008===
In 2008 the marathon was held on 17 February, participated by some 42,000 runners, of which over 30,000 joined the 10&nbsp;km event. (Originally 49,000 had signed up but 7,000 of them did not turn up.)<ref name="mp"/>

The 10&nbsp;km race took place at [[Island Eastern Corridor]] instead of [[Western Harbour Crossing]] like previous years. The race track started from [[City Garden]] in [[North Point]], and ran eastwards until [[Shau Kei Wan]], where it made a U-turn, back along westbound IEC and ended at [[Victoria Park, Hong Kong|Victoria Park]], near the western terminus of the IEC. Due to the proximity of Island Eastern Corridor from residential blocks such as those at City Garden, and also the early starting time of the races (05:10 to 06:40), residents complained about noises as loud as 60[[Decibel|dB]]. The organizer, however, stated that it hopes to use IEC again for the 2009 Marathon, since it successfully alleviated the problem of large numbers of runners rushing into Western Harbour Crossing, which made breathing difficult within the tunnel. The new route was welcomed by the participants, saying that it was better than the old one.<ref name="mp">{{Cite news|title=<U+99AC><U+62C9><U+677E><U+566A><U+97F3><U+8D85><U+6A19><U+5C45><U+6C11><U+6295><U+8A34>|publisher=Ming Pao|date=2008-02-18}}</ref><ref name="att">{{Cite web|url=http://www.asiatraveltips.com/news07/3010-HongKongMarathon.shtml|title=New Route for 2008 Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon|publisher=ASIATravelTips.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=<U+56DB><U+842C><U+4EBA><U+8DD1><U+99AC><U+62C9><U+677E><U+7834><U+7D00><U+9304>|publisher=Sing Tao Daily|date=2008-02-18}}</ref>

The full and half marathon's race tracks remained generally the same, starting from Nathan Road, [[Tsim Sha Tsui]], then going out to [[West Kowloon]] using [[Austin Road]], followed by [[West Kowloon Highway]] and [[Tsing Kwai Highway]], where half-marathoners turn back. Full-marathoners continue through [[Cheung Ching Tunnel]], then do a return trip each on [[Tsing Ma Bridge]] and Ting Kau Bridge. Competitors then ran back all the way to [[West Kowloon]], joining half-marathoners again at [[Kwai Chung]], and into [[Western Harbour Crossing]]. The finishing point, however, was changed to [[Victoria Park, Hong Kong|Victoria Park]] instead of the Golden Bauhina Plaza in [[Wan Chai North]]. This arrangement was welcomed by elite athletes, citing that it would improve their performance. [[Japan]]ese runner [[Koichioro Fukuoka]] won the full marathon in 2:16:50, ending [[Kenya]]'s four year domination of the event.<ref name="mp"/><ref name="att"/><ref>{{Cite news|title=<U+6E23><U+99AC><U+65B0><U+8CFD><U+9053><U+8DD1><U+624B><U+7540><U+6EFF><U+5206> <U+8DD1><U+5165><U+9B27><U+5E02><U+9577><U+76F4><U+8DEF><U+52A9><U+5275><U+4F73><U+7E3E>|publisher=Ming Pao|date=2007-02-28}}</ref>

===2009===
[[File:Hong Kong Marathon 2011 at Lockhart Road.jpg|thumb|Amateur runners on Lockhart Road at the 2011 edition.]]
The race for 2009 took place on 8 February, with the courses for all events remaining the same as the previous year. About 55,000 people enrolled, among which 51,272 runners turned up (of which 31,000 were of the 10&nbsp;km event, 7000 in full marathon), breaking previous records. The prize pool was US$100,000, with the winner getting US$20,000. [[Kenya]]n runner [[Cyprian Kiogora Mwobi]] won the full marathon in 2:14:57, setting a new course record. The women's title was won by [[Winnie Frida Kwamboka Nyansikera]], also Kenyan, in 2:41:25.<ref name="standard2009">{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&art_id=77936&sid=22616450&con_type=3|title=Pain and glory as 51,272 hit the streets|last=Chui|first=Timothy|date=2009-02-09|publisher=The Standard|accessdate=2009-02-16}}</ref><ref name="daily2009">{{Cite news|url=http://www.hkdailynews.com.hk/news.php?id=24428|title=<U+6E23><U+6253><U+99AC><U+62C9><U+677E><U+4EBA><U+6578><U+5275><U+65B0><U+9AD8>|date=2009-01-31|publisher=Hong Kong Daily News|language=Chinese|accessdate=2009-02-16}}</ref>

The finishing rate this year was 98%. The injury count was 394, of which 16 were sent to the hospital (including a case due to a temperature), down from 31 in 2008. 5000 runners requested massage due to [[cramp]]s. Blind students participated in the 10&nbsp;km race with escort by their teachers. The relative humidity that day was high at 60%-85%, making the race less comfortable. The inclination on the course was also a subject of complaint.<ref name="oriental2009_2">{{Cite news|url=http://news.sina.com.hk/cgi-bin/nw/show.cgi/4/1/1/1030169/1.html|title=<U+8DD1><U+99AC><U+62C9><U+677E><U+53D7><U+50B7><U+589E><U+500D><U+534A>|date=2009-02-09|publisher=Oriental Daily News|language=Chinese|accessdate=2009-02-16}}</ref><ref name="rthk2009">{{Cite news|url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/expressnews/20090208/news_20090208_55_558204.htm|title=<U+9999> <U+6E2F> <U+99AC> <U+62C9> <U+677E> 5000 <U+591A> <U+4EBA> <U+62BD> <U+7B4B> 16 <U+4EBA> <U+9001> <U+9662>|date=2009-02-08|publisher=RTHK|language=Chinese|accessdate=2009-02-16}}</ref>

Two runners were found using identical number bibs with the number "4", and this spurred discussion. The number belonged to the Hong Kong delegate, Lau Kwong-man. Several days later, his coach, Ng Fai-yeung, admitted that he took one bib (Lau got two bibs for being an invited runner, one in front and one on rear) from Lau, wore it and accompanied Leung Yuen-fan, another teammate, in the race. The event committee delivered its verdict on 12 February with reference to the scandal, disqualifying Lau and Leung from the race. The HKAAA has considered holding a disciplinary hearing on the matter.<ref name="world2009">{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldjournal.com/wj-hk-news.php?nt_seq_id=1846268|title=<U+99AC><U+62C9><U+677E><U+9020><U+5047> <U+5169><U+9078><U+624B><U+6210><U+7E3E><U+53D6><U+6D88>|date=2009-02-13|publisher=worldjournal.com|language=Chinese|accessdate=2009-02-16}}</ref><ref name="oriental2009">{{Cite news|url=http://news.sina.com.hk/cgi-bin/nw/show.cgi/2/1/1/1033521/1.html|title=<U+5169><U+500B>4<U+865F><U+99AC><U+62C9><U+677E><U+7206><U+9020><U+5047>|date=2009-02-12|publisher=Oriental Daily News|language=Chinese|accessdate=2009-02-16}}</ref>

The 2010 race saw Cyprian Kiogara Mwobi become the first man to defend his title in Hong Kong, and only the second person to do so after [[Yuko Gordon]] won the women's races in 1983 and 1984.<ref name=ARRS/>

At the 2011 edition, held on 20 February, [[Nelson Kirwa Rotich]] won the men's elite race in a time of 2:16.00 hours. However, it was the women's elite race that proved to be the high point of that year's events: young Kenyan runner [[Janet Rono]] failed to gain a position within the invited foreign athletes and she chose to fund her own journey and participation for the event. The move paid off as she won the race in a new women's course record time of 2:33:42, erasing [[Irina Bogachova]]'s ten-year-old mark.<ref>Butcher, Pat (2011-02-20).

The route was modified in the 2012 race to pass through the [[Central Piers]] and the newly reclaimed areas around the [[Tamar site]]. Ethiopians set new course records for both men's and women's races: [[Dejere Abera]] for the men's record with 2:11:27 hours and [[Misiker Demissie]] for the women's record with 2:30:12 hours.
