[[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] '''[[Sir]] Walter Henry Cowan, 1st Baronet''' [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath|KCB]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] & [[Medal bar|Bar]], [[Member of the Royal Victorian Order|MVO]] (11 June 1871 &ndash; 14 February 1956), known as '''Tich Cowan''', was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]] [[admiral]] who saw service in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]; in the latter he was one of the oldest British servicemen on active duty.

==Early days==
Cowan was born in [[Crickhowell]], [[Brecknockshire]], the son of an officer in the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]]. After his father's retirement from the [[British Army|Army]], the family settled in [[Alveston, Warwickshire]], where his father became a [[justice of the peace]].

Cowan never went to school, but entered the Royal Navy in 1884<ref name=lh>[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/locreg/COWAN1.shtml Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives]</ref> at the training ship, [[HMS Prince of Wales (1860)|HMS ''Britannia'']], a classmate to fellow future admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]].

==Early service==
In 1886, as [[Midshipman|Midshipmen]], Cowan and Beatty joined [[HMS Alexandra (1875)|HMS ''Alexandra'']], [[flagship]] of the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]]. Cowan saw service in [[Benin Empire|Benin]] and [[Nigeria]] in 1887.<ref name=lh/> He fell sick and was invalided home after less than a year, but later rejoined the ''Alexandra'', returning with her to Britain in 1889. He then joined [[HMS Volage (1869)|HMS ''Volage'']] in the Training Squadron and was commissioned as a [[Sub-Lieutenant]] in 1890. He was appointed to [[HMS Boadicea (1875)|HMS ''Boadicea'']], flagship of the [[East Indies Station|East India Station]]. In 1892 he was promoted [[Lieutenant]] and became [[First Lieutenant]] of the [[gunboat]] [[HMS Redbreast (1889)|HMS ''Redbreast'']].<ref name=lh/> However, in 1893 he was invalided home with [[dysentery]].

In 1894 he was appointed to the [[light cruiser]] [[HMS Barrosa (1889)|HMS ''Barrosa'']] off [[West Africa]].<ref name=lh/> During this time he participated in a number of expeditions against native and Arab insurgents.<ref name=lh/>

In 1898, he was appointed to the [[destroyer]] [[HMS Boxer (1894)|HMS ''Boxer'']] in the Mediterranean, but only stayed in her for six months before being given command of the [[Nile]] gunboat [[HMS Sultan|HMS ''Sultan'']]. He took part in the Battles of [[Battle of Atbara|Atbara]] and [[Battle of Omdurman|Omdurman]] and then commanded the entire Nile gunboat flotilla during the [[Fashoda Incident]].<ref name=lh/> He received the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) for these actions. 

Cowan then particiated in the [[Second Boer War]], acting as [[aide-de-camp]] to [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]<ref name=lh/> and then to [[Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]].<ref name=lh/>

Returning to England in 1901, he was appointed First Lieutenant of the [[battleship]] [[HMS Prince George (1895)|HMS ''Prince George'']]. In June 1901 he was promoted [[Commander]] at the early age of thirty. He later took command of the destroyer [[HMS Falcon (1899)|HMS ''Falcon'']] and acted as second-in-command of the [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]] destroyer flotilla under [[Roger Keyes]], who was then developing new destroyer tactics. They became fast friends. Cowan commanded several more destroyers, acquiring a widespread reputation as a destroyer captain, and then succeeded Keyes in command of the flotilla. In 1904 he was appointed [[Royal Victorian Order|Member of the Royal Victorian Order]] (MVO). In 1905 he took command of [[HMS Skirmisher (1905)|HMS ''Skirmisher'']] and he was promoted [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] in 1906. He transferred to the [[cruiser]] [[HMS Sapphire (1904)|HMS ''Sapphire'']] in 1907 and in 1908 took command of all destroyers of the [[Channel Fleet]]. In 1909 he transferred to the [[Reserve Fleet]] and in 1910 he became captain of the new light cruiser [[HMS Gloucester (1909)|HMS ''Gloucester'']].

In 1912 he became [[Chief of staff (military)|chief of staff]] to [[John de Robeck]], who was then Flag Officer Patrols.

==World War I==
In 1914, shortly before the outbreak of the [[First World War]], he was given command of the old pre-dreadnought [[HMS Zealandia|HMS ''Zealandia'']].<ref name=lh/> Six months later he took over the 26,270 ton [[HMS Princess Royal (1911)|HMS ''Princess Royal'']]<ref name=lh/> as [[flag captain]] to [[Osmond Brock]]. He commanded her at the [[Battle of Jutland]],<ref name=lh/> where she was badly damaged. He was appointed [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in 1916.

==The Baltic==
In June 1917 Cowan was made [[Commodore (RN)|Commodore]] of the [[1st Light Cruiser Squadron]].<ref name=lh/> In 1918 he was promoted [[Rear-Admiral]], staying in command of the squadron. In January 1919 the squadron was sent to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]].<ref name=lh/> The squadron kept the sea lanes open to the newly independent [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]], enabling them to [[Estonian War of Independence|secure their freedom]]. During the course of this campaign, coastal [[torpedo boat]]s attached to Cowan's command sank two [[Bolshevik]] battleships and one cruiser at [[Kronstadt]] naval base. [[Augustine William Shelton Agar|Augustus Agar]] received the [[Victoria Cross]] for his part in these events. [[Andrew Browne Cunningham]], later Britain's leading [[World War II]] admiral, commanded Cowan's destroyers in this campaign. Cowan's forceful diplomacy ensured a successful mission, for which he was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1919 and created a [[Baronet]], "of the Baltic", in the 1921 New Year Honours.

==Between the Wars==
In 1921, Cowan was appointed to command the  [[British Battlecruiser Squadron|Battlecruiser Squadron]],<ref name=lh/> flying his flag in [[HMS Hood (51)|HMS ''Hood'']]. He was unemployed from 1923 to 1925, although he was promoted [[Vice-Admiral]] in 1923. In 1925 he was appointed [[Flag Officer Scotland, Northern England, Northern Ireland|Commander-in-Chief, Coast of Scotland]]<ref name=lh/> and in 1926 [[North America and West Indies Station|Commander-in-Chief, America and West Indies Station]],<ref name=lh/> holding the command until 1928. He was promoted [[Admiral]] in 1927. His final appointment was as [[First and Principal Naval Aide-de-Camp]] to the King in 1930. He retired in 1931.<ref name=lh/>

==Oldest warrior==
During World War II he was given a job by his old friend Roger Keyes, then head of the [[British Commandos|Commandos]]. Cowan voluntarily took the lower rank of [[Commander]] and went to Scotland in 1941 to train the commandos in small boat handling.<ref name=lh/> He served in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], where he saw action at [[Mechili]] and at the [[Battle of Bir Hakeim]], where he was captured on 27 May 1942,<ref name=lh/> having attached himself to the [[British Indian Army|Indian]] [[18th King Edward VII's Own Cavalry]] (his commando unit having been disbanded). He was fighting an Italian [[tank]] crew single-handedly armed only with a [[revolver]]. He was repatriated in 1943 under an unusual agreement with Italy whereby some 800 Italian seamen interned in neutral [[Saudi Arabia]] from the [[Red Sea]] squadron were exchanged for a similar number of British POWs. An unusual feature was that there was no stipulation about the men<U+2019>s future activities and they were free to return to action so he rejoined the commandos and saw action in [[Italy]] during 1944. He was awarded a bar to his DSO. He retired once more in 1945. After the war he was invited to become Colonel of the 18th King Edward VII's Own and visited India to receive this honour, which he considered the greatest he had received.

==Tribute==
In 2007 the [[Estonian Navy]] named a British-made minehunter of the [[Sandown class minehunter|''Sandown'' class]] the [[EML Admiral Cowan (M313)|''Admiral Cowan'']].<ref>[http://web-static.vm.ee/static/failid/021/ER_39.pdf Estonian Review<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Memorials to the 110 men of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force killed in the [[Baltic]] action of 1919 are now in the Estonian capital [[Tallinn]], the Latvian capital [[Riga]] and [[Portsmouth]] cathedral.
