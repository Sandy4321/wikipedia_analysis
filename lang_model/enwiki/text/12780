==Early years==
Favre was born in [[Gulfport, Mississippi]] to Irvin (b. January 5, 1945 in Pass Christian, Mississippi <U+2013> d. December 21, 2003 in Kiln, Mississippi) and Bonita (b. September 27, 1944 in [[Pass Christian, Mississippi]]) Favre, and raised in the small town of [[Kiln, Mississippi|Kiln]]. Both his parents were schoolteachers in the [[Hancock County School District]]. He is of [[French American|French]] and [[Choctaw]] ancestry; one of his paternal grandparents was a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] affiliated with the Choctaw.<ref name=FavreBackground>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianz.com/News/2004/001648.asp|title=Mississippi Choctaw chief to speak at Brett Favre Day|publisher=Indianz.com|date=May 7, 2004|accessdate=February 8, 2007
}}</ref> He was the second of four children and attended [[Hancock North Central High School]] where he played baseball and football. Favre started for the Hancock North Central baseball team as an eighth-grader and earned five varsity letters. He played [[quarterback]], [[lineman (football)|lineman]], [[Defensive back|strong safety]], [[placekicker]] and [[punter (football position)|punter]] in a primarily [[option offense|option]], run-oriented offense coached by his father, Irvin Favre, who was the head coach of the team.

Irvin Favre said he knew his son had a great arm but also knew that the school was blessed with good [[running back]]s. As a result, in the three years Brett was on the team, his father ran the [[wishbone formation|wishbone]], a run-oriented offense. Favre rarely threw more than five passes in a game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=355010|title=Favre was toughened by brothers, dad|last=D'Amato|first=Gary|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=October 10, 2005|accessdate=February 8, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070929111601/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=355010|archivedate=September 29, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

==College career==
After high school, [[The University of Southern Mississippi|Southern Mississippi]] offered Favre a scholarship (the only one he received). Southern Miss wanted him to play [[defensive back]], but Favre wanted to play quarterback instead. Favre began his freshman year as the seventh-string quarterback and took over the starting position in the [[1987 NCAA Division I-A football season|second half of the third game of the year]] against [[Tulane Green Wave football|Tulane]] on September 19, 1987. Favre, despite suffering a hangover from the night before and vomiting during warm-ups, led the Golden Eagles to a come-from-behind victory with two touchdown passes.<ref name=college/> Favre started ten games during his freshman year and won six of them.

In his junior season, Favre led the [[1989 Southern Miss Golden Eagles football team|Golden Eagles]] to an upset of [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] (then ranked sixth in the nation) on September 2, 1989. Favre capped a six-and-a-half-minute drive with the game-winning touchdown pass with 23 seconds remaining.<ref name=college>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=356600|title=Favre caught on quickly in college|last=D'Amato|first=Gary|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=October 17, 2005|accessdate=February 8, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070929121108/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=356600|archivedate=September 29, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

On July 14, 1990, before the start of Favre's senior year at [[1990 Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles football team|Southern Miss]], he was involved in a near-fatal car accident. When going around a bend a few tenths of a mile from his parents' house, Favre lost control of his car, which flipped three times and came to rest against a tree. It was only after one of his brothers smashed a car window with a golf club that Favre could be evacuated to the hospital. In the [[ambulance]], his mother was sitting with him. "All I kept asking [her] was 'Will I be able to play football again?'" Favre recalled later. Doctors would later remove {{convert|30|in|mm}} of Favre's [[small intestine]]. Six weeks after this incident, on September 8, Favre led Southern Miss to a comeback victory over [[1990 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]. Alabama coach [[Gene Stallings]] said, "You can call it a miracle or a legend or whatever you want to. I just know that on that day, Brett Favre was larger than life."<ref name=FavreTimeline>{{Cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/features/favre/timeline|title=Brett Favre Timeline|last=Traina|first=Jimmy|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=October 5, 2002|accessdate=February 8, 2007}}</ref>

Favre continues to hold various Southern Miss football records. As of the end of the 2010 season, he held the career individual record in the following categories: most plays, most total yards gained, most passing yards gained, most completions made, and most passing attempts made. He had held the record for the most touchdowns scored (52), but it was later tied by quarterback [[Lee Roberts (American football)|Lee Roberts]], who played for the school from 1995<U+2013>98. Favre had 15 games over his career where he compiled more than 200 passing yards, making him the fourth all<U+2013>time school leader in that category. Of those 15 games, five were 300-yard games, the most compiled by any of the school's quarterbacks. Additionally, he was the seasonal leader in total passing and total offense in all four of his seasons at Southern Miss.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/smis/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/08-mediaguide-section7.pdf|title=2008 Southern Miss Football Media Guide|pages=124, 128<U+2013>129, 137|publisher=Southern Miss Athletics|accessdate=July 25, 2008|format=PDF}}</ref>

==Professional career==
===Atlanta Falcons (1991)===
Favre was drafted by the [[Atlanta Falcons]] in the second round, 33rd overall in the [[1991 NFL Draft]].<ref name=favredrafted>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/draft/history/years/1991#round2|title=NFL Draft History <U+2013> 1991|publisher=NFL.com|accessdate=February 16, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070219015929/http://www.nfl.com/draft/history/years/1991#round2|archivedate=February 19, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> On July 19, 1991, Favre agreed to a three-year, [[United States dollar|$]]1.4&nbsp;million contract with a reported signing bonus of $350,000.<ref>"ROUNDUP; Smerlas, Morris Try New Teams", [[Washington Post]], July 19, 1991.</ref> Atlanta coach [[Jerry Glanville]] did not approve of the drafting of Favre, saying it would take a plane crash for him to put Favre into the game.<ref name=JSAtlanta>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=358097|title=Trading places|last=D'Amato|first=Gary|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=October 24, 2005|accessdate=February 8, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070929132210/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=358097|archivedate=September 29, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Favre's first pass in an NFL regular season game resulted in an interception returned for a touchdown. He only attempted four passes in his career at Atlanta, was intercepted twice, and completed none of them. Brett took one other snap, which resulted in a sack for an eleven yard loss.<ref name=nflstats/>

The Green Bay Packers general manager [[Ron Wolf]] traded a first-round pick (19th overall, which would be used for [[Tony Smith (American football)|Tony Smith]]) for Favre during the following offseason. Wolf, while an assistant to the general manager of the [[New York Jets]], had intended to take Favre in the 1991 NFL draft, but Favre was taken by the Falcons on the previous pick.<ref name=JSAtlanta/>

According to the ''[[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]]'' and other sources, during the physical after the trade, Favre was diagnosed with [[avascular necrosis]] of the hip, the same degenerative condition that ended [[Bo Jackson]]'s football career, and doctors recommended his physical be failed, which would nullify the trade. Wolf overruled them.<ref name=failphysical>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=348858|title=What, his hip?

===Green Bay Packers (1992<U+2013>2007)===
Brett Favre played 16 seasons in Green Bay. During his time in Green Bay, Favre was the first NFL player to win three consecutive AP MVP awards. The only player to win four AP MVP Awards is [[Peyton Manning]].<ref name=Favre1997/> He helped the Packers appear in two Super Bowls, winning [[Super Bowl XXXI]].

====Beginnings (1992<U+2013>94)====
In the second game of the [[1992 NFL season|1992 season]], the [[1992 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] played the [[1992 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. The Buccaneers were leading 17<U+2013>0 at halftime when head coach [[Mike Holmgren]] benched starting quarterback [[Don Majkowski]] and Favre played the second half. On his first regular season play as a Packer, Favre threw a pass that was deflected and caught by himself. Favre was tackled and the completion went for <U+2212>7&nbsp;yards. The Packers lost the game 31<U+2013>3, chalking up only 106&nbsp;yards passing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.databasefootball.com/boxscores/gamedata.htm?dy=13&mth=9&yr=1992&tm=TAM&lg=NFL|title=NFL Box Score for 9/13/1992|publisher=Databasefootball.com|accessdate=February 7, 2007}}</ref><ref name=Favre1992>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=359903|title=Favre bursts onto the NFL scene in 1992|last=McGinn|first=Bob|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=October 1, 2005|accessdate=February 8, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070929133201/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=359903|archivedate=September 29, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

In the third game of the 1992 season, Majkowski injured a ligament in his ankle against the [[1992 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]], an injury severe enough that he would be out for four weeks. Favre replaced Majkowski for the remainder of the contest. Favre fumbled four times during the course of the game,<ref name=Favre1992/> a performance poor enough that the crowd chanted for Favre to be removed in favor of another Packers backup quarterback at the time, [[Ty Detmer]].<ref name=FavreBeginning>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasalle.edu/collegian/sports/articles/06/oct11/brett_favre.html|title=La Salle University article on Brett Favre|publisher=Lasalle.edu|accessdate=February 24, 2007}}</ref> However, down 23<U+2013>17 with 1:07 left in the game, the Packers started an offensive series on their own 8 yard line.

Three plays later, Favre threw the game<U+2013>winning touchdown pass to [[Kitrick Taylor]] with 13 seconds remaining.<ref name=Favre1992/>

The next week's game against the [[1992 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] began the longest consecutive starts streak for a quarterback in NFL history. The game ended in a 17<U+2013>3 victory and his [[passer rating]] was 144.6. During the season, Favre helped put together a six-game winning streak for the Packers, the longest winning streak for the club since [[1965 Green Bay Packers season|1965]]. They ended 9<U+2013>7 that season, missing the playoffs on their last game.<ref name=Favre1992/> Favre finished his first season as a Packer with 3,227&nbsp;yards and a quarterback rating of 85.3, helping him to his first [[Pro Bowl]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.databasefootball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=GNB&yr=1992&lg=nfl|title=1992 Green Bay Packers|publisher=Databasefootball.com|accessdate=February 7, 2007}}</ref>

The [[1993 NFL season|following season]] Favre helped the [[1993 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] to their [[1993<U+2013>94 NFL playoffs|first playoff berth]] since [[1982 NFL season|1982]] and was named to his second [[1994 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]]. After the season Favre became a free agent. General manager Ron Wolf negotiated Favre into a five-year, $19&nbsp;million contract.

While being treated for various injuries, Brett Favre developed an addiction to [[vicodin]], which became publicly known when he suffered a seizure during a hospital visit.

In [[Super Bowl XXXI]], Favre completed 14 of 27 passes for 246&nbsp;yards and 2 touchdowns. On the second play of the game, Favre threw a 54-yard touchdown pass to receiver [[Andre Rison]]. Favre also completed an 81-yard touchdown pass to [[Antonio Freeman]] in the second quarter (then a Super Bowl record). Favre rushed for 12&nbsp;yards and another touchdown, as the Packers won Super Bowl XXXI over the [[1996 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], 35<U+2013>21. In their 19 games of the season, the Packers had a turnover ratio of plus 24, and outscored their opponents 100<U+2013>48 in the playoffs.<ref name=Favre1996/>

Favre and the [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] continued their dominance of the NFC during the [[1997 NFL season|next season]]. Favre was named AP co-MVP of the league along with [[Detroit Lions]]' running back [[Barry Sanders]], his third straight award. Also, Green Bay advanced through the [[1997<U+2013>98 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] to the Super Bowl for the second year in a row. After being heavily favored by 13 points, the Packers lost to the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] in [[Super Bowl XXXII]] by the score of 31<U+2013>24 at [[Qualcomm Stadium]] in [[San Diego]], ending the NFC's 13-year Super Bowl winning streak.

====Mid-career (1998<U+2013>2002)====
[[Image:Packvbears.jpg|thumb|Favre, standing, scans the [[Chicago Bears|Bears']] defense during the 2004 season.]]
The Packers lost to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in a wild card playoff game in 1998. Favre had rallied the team with a touchdown pass to [[Antonio Freeman]] with 1:56 remaining in the game to put the Packers up 27<U+2013>23. However, [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] responded with a touchdown of his own to [[Terrell Owens]] with three seconds remaining to end the Packers season.<ref name=Niners>{{Cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/1998/playoffs/news/1999/01/03/49ers_first/|title=Young stuns Packers with amazing TD pass in final seconds|publisher=CNNSI.com|accessdate=January 21, 2010|date=January 4, 1999}}</ref> Favre and the Packers failed for the first time since 1994 to at least reach the NFC championship game.<ref name=NFCChamps>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nfl&id=4837678|title=National Football Conference Champions|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=January 21, 2010}}</ref>

In the regular season finale of 2001, Favre was the target of minor controversy when, in a game against the [[2001 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] at [[Giants Stadium]], he was sacked by the Giants defensive end [[Michael Strahan]]. It was Strahan's lone sack of the game and gave him the NFL's single<U+2013>season sack record of 22.5, which topped [[Mark Gastineau]]'s record of 22 set in 1984.<ref name=Sacksleaderboard>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/history/randf/records/indiv/sacks|title=Record and Fact Book: The Definitive Source for NFL Information|publisher=NFL.com|accessdate=November 15, 2006}}</ref> Some analysts, such as Mike Freeman of ''[[The New York Times]]'', expressed the opinion that Favre allowed himself to be sacked in order to allow Strahan to set the record.<ref name=Freeman>{{Cite journal|title=Pro Football: Inside the NFL; Favre Was Not First To Grant Special Favor.|journal=[[New York Times]]|last=Freeman|first=Mike|date=January 13, 2002|accessdate=July 26, 2007}}</ref>

On March 1, 2001, Favre signed a "lifetime" contract extension, which technically was a 10-year contract extension worth around $100&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.jsonline.com/packer/news/mar01/packers03030201.asp|title=Contract sets Favre for life|publisher=Journal Sentinel Inc|accessdate=November 15, 2006}}</ref>

Favre and the Packers continued posting positive results through the next few seasons. Through the 2004 season, the Packers had the longest streak of non-losing seasons (13) in the NFL, despite an 8<U+2013>8 record under coach [[Ray Rhodes]], a 9<U+2013>7 season under coach [[Mike Sherman]], and no playoff berths in either 1999 or 2000. The streak ended in 2005, with the Packers finishing 4<U+2013>12 overall.

====Later career & personal tragedies (2003<U+2013>06)====
One day after his father died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] or [[stroke]],<ref name=Irvin>{{Cite news|url=http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2003/12/21/2/|title=Favre's Father Dies At 58|last=Jones|first=Al|work=Packers.com|agency=Associated Press|date=December 21, 2003|accessdate=February 8, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060513230437/http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2003/12/21/2/|archivedate=May 13, 2006}}</ref> Favre decided to play in a December 22, 2003, ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game against the [[2003 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]. The Packers traveled to [[Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum|Oakland]] where Favre passed for four touchdowns in the first half and 399 total yards in a 41<U+2013>7 victory over the Raiders on international television (even receiving applause from "[[Raider Nation]]"). He completed 73.3% of his passes and finished the game with a [[passer rating]] of 154.9<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/players/brettfavre/gamelogs?id=FAV540222&season=2003|title=Brett Favre: Game Logs at|publisher=NFL.com|date=|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}</ref> <U+2013> the highest of Favre's career and just 3.4 points shy of perfect.

A notable game in the [[2004 NFL season|2004 season]] in which Favre and the Packers finished 10<U+2013>6 was against the [[2004 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]. During the game, Favre suffered a concussion. He did not receive medical clearance to re-enter the game. Despite the concussion, Favre threw a 28-yard touchdown to [[Javon Walker]] on a fourth down play. Afterwards it was reported that Favre did not remember throwing the touchdown pass.<ref name=Concussion>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/04/sports/football/04packers.html|title=Favre's Concussion Adds to Packers' Woes|work=[[New York Times]]|date=October 4, 2004|accessdate=October 22, 2008|first=Pat|last=Borzi}}</ref>

After the death of his father, a series of events related to Favre's family were reported in the media. In October 2004, ten months after the death of Favre's father, his brother-in-law, Casey Tynes, was killed in an [[all-terrain vehicle]] accident on Favre's [[Mississippi]] property.<ref name=wifeandcousin>{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/packers/2005-10-19-deanna-favre-cover_x.htm|title=Deanna Favre gives Green Bay another reason to cheer|last=Weisman|first=Larry|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 19, 2005|accessdate=February 8, 2007}}</ref>

Soon after in 2004, Favre's wife, [[Deanna Favre]], was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. Following aggressive treatment through 2004, she recovered. She created The Deanna Favre Hope Foundation which supports breast cancer education and women's breast imaging and diagnosis services for all women, including those who are medically underserved.<ref name=wifeandcousin/>

For the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], the [[2005 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]], despite throwing for over 3,000&nbsp;yards for a record 14th consecutive time, Favre had a below average season with only 20 touchdown passes and a league-leading 29 interceptions. The loss of guards [[Marco Rivera]] and [[Mike Wahle]] to [[free agent|free agency]] along with key injuries to [[Javon Walker]], [[Ahman Green]], [[Bubba Franks]], among others, hampered Favre and the team. His passer rating was 70.9, 31st in the NFL and the worst single season rating of his career.<ref name=qbrating>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/statistics?stat=pass&sort=rat&league=nfl&season=2&year=2005|title=NFL Passing Stats 2005|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=December 12, 2006}}</ref> After the disappointing season, many speculated that Favre would retire.<ref name=Retirementspeculation>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2311729|title=Favre says he's leaning toward retirement|publisher=ESPN.com|date=January 30, 2006|accessdate=February 8, 2007}}</ref> However, on April 26, 2006, Favre announced that he would remain with the team for the 2006 season.

In the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]], Favre suffered his first career [[Shutout#American football|shutout]] against the [[2006 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]].

====Milestone season (2007)====
On February 26, 2007, Brett Favre underwent minor arthroscopic ankle surgery in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[Wisconsin]] to remove a buildup of [[bone spur]]s in his left ankle.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sf20070228a1.html|title=Favre has ankle surgery; Garcia shunned|publisher=The Japan Times Online|date=February 28, 2007|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}</ref>

[[Image:09.30.07 favre 421TD.JPG|thumb|Favre broke [[Dan Marino]]'s touchdown pass record on September 30, 2007, at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]]]]
Favre began the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]] trailing in a number of career NFL passing records. On September 16, 2007, Favre and the [[2007 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] defeated the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] to give Favre his record setting 149th win, passing [[John Elway]]. On September 30, Favre threw a 16 yard touchdown pass to [[Greg Jennings]] in a game against the Vikings. This was his 421st NFL touchdown pass, and set a new all time record, surpassing [[Dan Marino]]'s 420.

On November 4, 2007, after the Packers defeated the [[2007 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] 33<U+2013>22, Favre became only the 3rd quarterback to have defeated all thirty-one other current NFL teams.

Favre led the Packers to a 13<U+2013>3 regular season record, the [[NFC North]] championship, and the second seed in the [[2007<U+2013>08 NFL playoffs|NFC playoffs]]. Prior to the Packers' playoff game against the [[2007 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], Favre stated his desire to continue playing football for another season.<ref name=LookingToward>{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/491/story/438623.html|last=Jones|first=Al|title=Favre indicates he's looking toward another season, Sun Herald reports|publisher=The Kansas City Star|work=KansasCity.com|date=January 10, 2008|accessdate=January 10, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080121211816/http://www.kansascity.com/491/story/438623.html|archivedate=January 21, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> In the [[2007<U+2013>08 NFL playoffs|Divisional Playoffs]], Favre threw three touchdowns as the Packers cruised to a 42<U+2013>20 victory over the Seahawks at a snowy Lambeau Field.

Negotiating sub-zero temperatures, Favre amassed 236 passing yards and two touchdowns, but also threw an interception in overtime that set up the Giants' game-winning field goal. Favre's 90-yard touchdown pass to [[Donald Driver]] in the second quarter was the longest pass in Packers playoff history, and it extended Favre's NFL record for consecutive postseason games with a touchdown pass to 18.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=2801200098|title=Manning, Giants head to Super Bowl for rematch with Pats|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}</ref>  Favre stated after the game that he would make a decision more quickly than he has in the past regarding whether he would return for another season.

Favre's milestone 2007 season culminated with his selection to the [[2008 Pro Bowl]] as the starting quarterback for the NFC, but an ankle injury forced him to withdraw.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/26/sportsline/main2519166.shtml|work=CBS News|title=Brett Favre Has Minor Ankle Surgery|date=February 26, 2007}}</ref>

====Retirements and returns (2008)====
Beginning near the end of the 2006 season, word began to surface that Favre was considering retirement. In fact, playing in [[Soldier Field]] against the arch-rival Bears in the season finale, Favre was given a standing ovation in the closing seconds of the Packer victory as a show of respect from Chicago fans to their longtime nemesis. Moments later at the postgame interview, he gave a tearful interview with an [[NBC Sports]] correspondent, where he admitted his future was still questionable. However, after much debate, he returned for 2007, during which his future was once again in doubt and an oft-discussed topic, with many in the media speculating that if the Packers made the Super Bowl, Favre would indeed retire and hand the reins to the unproven but talented [[Aaron Rodgers]], who was drafted two years earlier as Favre's [[heir-apparent]]. Ultimately, the Packers fell in the NFC Championship to the New York Giants (who in turn upset the heavily favored New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII).

On March 4, 2008, Favre formally announced his retirement.<ref>{{Cite document|last=Walker|first=Don|title=Favre retiring, Fox Sports reports|url=http://blogs.jsonline.com/packers/|publisher=[[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]]|date=March 4, 2008|accessdate=March 4, 2008|postscript=<!--None-->|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080216044939/http://blogs.jsonline.com/packers/|archivedate=February 16, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iJ4dh7TkvXFMpdKZU9rITbou7jtwD8V6MH9G0|title=Brett Favre Set to Retire After 17 Years|publisher=Google|agency=Associated Press|date=March 4, 2008}}</ref><ref name=packers.com>{{Cite news|url=http://www.packers.com/news/releases/2008/03/04/1/slim/|title=Statement From Packers General Manager Ted Thompson|date=March 4, 2008}}</ref>  Although Favre stated that he had been willing to play another year, he felt that another season would only be successful if he led his team to another [[Super Bowl]] victory. He added the chances for a Super Bowl win were small, and that he wasn't up for the challenge. At his press conference, Favre openly wept about leaving the NFL. He stated that his decision, regardless of what was being said in the media, had nothing to do with what the Packers did or didn't do. He said, seemingly contradictory to Cook's statements, that his decision to retire was based on the fact that he didn't want to play anymore. He said during the conference, "I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. And that's really what it comes down to."<ref name=packers.com/>

On July 2, 2008, it was reported that Favre was in contact with the Packers about a possible return to the team.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mortensen|first=Chris|title=Favre has 'itch' to ditch retirement, report to camp|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3471189|publisher=ESPN.com|date=July 2, 2008|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}</ref>  On July 11, 2008, Favre sent a letter to the Packers asking for his unconditional release to allow him to play for another NFL team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3483521|title=Favre seeks unconditional release from Packers, sources say|date=July 11, 2008|accessdate=July 11, 2008|publisher=ESPN}}</ref>  Packers general manager [[Ted Thompson]] announced he would not grant Favre an unconditional release<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3484473|title=Packers GM, coach say team won't release Favre despite request|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=July 16, 2008|date=July 13, 2008}}</ref> and reaffirmed the organization's commitment to [[Aaron Rodgers]] as its new quarterback.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/15/AR2008071502113_pf.html|title=Favre Says He's Tempted to Show Up at Packers Camp|first=Chris|last=Jenkins|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> Complicating matters was Favre's unique contract giving him the leverage to void any potential trade by not reporting to the camp of the team he might be traded to if the Packers elect to go that route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d8094bd7a&template=with-video&confirm=true|title=Favre now owns a unique no-trade clause|date=July 15, 2008|accessdate=July 22, 2008|publisher=NFL.com}}</ref>

Favre spoke publicly for the first time about his potential comeback in a July 14, 2008, interview with [[Greta Van Susteren]] on the [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[On the Record with Greta Van Susteren]]''. In the interview, Favre said he was "guilty of retiring early," that he was "never fully committed" to retirement, and that he was pressured by the Packers to make a decision before the [[2008 NFL Draft|NFL Draft]] and the start of the [[Free agent#NFL usage|free agent signing period]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3486775|title=Favre to Fox News: Packers should let me play elsewhere|date=July 14, 2008|accessdate=July 14, 2008|publisher=ESPN}}</ref>  Favre disputed the notion that he doesn't want to play for Green Bay and said that while he understands the organization has decided to move on, they should now allow him to do the same. He made clear that he would not return to the Packers as a backup and reiterated his desire to be released rather than traded, which would allow him the freedom to play for a competitive team.

Favre officially signed with the Minnesota Vikings on August 18, 2009.  He would go on to have a landmark season in which he surpassed former Vikings defensive end [[Jim Marshall (American football)|Jim Marshall]] for consecutive starts at one position, with 291.<ref>[http://ballhype.com/article/favre-sets-starts-record-as-vikings-overtake-lions/]{{Dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref>, became the first quarterback in NFL history to defeat every one of the league's 32 franchises since the NFL first expanded to 32 franchises in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=291005016|title=Green Bay Packers vs. Minnesota Vikings <U+2013> Recap <U+2013> October 05, 2009 <U+2013> ESPN|publisher=Sports.espn.go.com|date=|accessdate=April 3, 2010}}</ref>, surpassed Dan Marino's previous record for four-touchdown games, and was named to his [[2010 Pro Bowl|11th Pro Bowl]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/probowl/story?id=09000d5d8155c2fa&template=with-video-with-comments&confirm=true|title=2010 Pro Bowl rosters|date=December 29, 2009}}</ref>  The Vikings finished 12-4 and advanced to the NFC Championship game, ultimately losing in overtime to the eventual Super Bowl champion [[New Orleans Saints]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60O0DD20100125?type=sportsNews|title=Saints edge Vikings to reach first Super Bowl|date=January 24, 2010|work=Reuters|accessdate=January 24, 2010}}</ref> Despite the loss, Favre set playoff records for pass completions and passing yards previously held by [[Joe Montana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/playoffs/story?id=09000d5d815f22c6&template=with-video-with-comments&confirm=true|title=Favre left limping away from another title game loss; future unclear|date=January 25, 2010|work=NFL.com|accessdate=January 26, 2010}}</ref>

Favre missed the rest of the game and was replaced by [[Tarvaris Jackson]] who led the Vikings to victory despite throwing three interceptions.

On December 13, 2010, due to his sprained shoulder, Brett Favre was marked inactive for the game against the [[New York Giants]] ending his consecutive regular season start streak at 297. Favre started a total of 321 games including post-season appearances. On December 20, 2010 while playing the [[Chicago Bears]] outside at [[TCF Bank Stadium]] due to the collapse of the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]], Favre sustained a [[concussion]] after being sacked by Bears defensive end [[Corey Wootton]]. This would be his final appearance in an NFL game.

On January 2, 2011, Favre was unable to play against the [[Detroit Lions]] in the final game of the regular NFL season due to his inability to pass NFL-mandated post-concussion tests. In a press conference immediately following the game, Favre announced his intention to retire from professional football.

On January 17, 2011, Favre officially filed his retirement papers with the NFL.<ref>{{cite web|last=Marvez|first=Alex|title=Favre turns in retirement paperwork

===Post-NFL career===
Despite another offseason full of rumors of Favre's return, the 2011 NFL season began without Favre on an NFL roster.

A grandson, Parker Brett, was born to Brittany on April 2, 2010.<ref name=FavreBio>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0269442/bio|title=Brett Favre's Biography at IMDB|publisher=IMDB.com|accessdate=April 21, 2007}}</ref>  The NFL has stated that it knew of no other grandfathers among current NFL players.

Favre's mother, Bonita, helps manage his holdings in agriculture and real estate, handle his endorsements and appearances and oversee his charity work.<ref name=BayouFavre>{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E2DB123BF93AA25752C0A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|title=A Bayou Town Catches Favre Fever|publisher=New York Times|date=January 19, 1997|last=Longman|first=Jere|accessdate=January 3, 2008}}</ref> Brett and Bonita Favre released a book in 2004 titled ''Favre'' (ISBN 978-1-59071-036-4) which discusses their personal family and [[Green Bay Packers]] family, including the ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game that followed the death of Brett's father Irvin Favre.<ref name=BonitaFavre>{{cite web|url=http://www.onmilwaukee.com/sports/articles/bonitafavre.html|title=Bonita Favre Tackles Questions About Brett|publisher=OnMilwaukee.com|date=November 9, 2004|last=Gutowski|first=Tim|accessdate=January 3, 2008}}</ref>

Favre established the [[Brett Favre Fourward Foundation]] in 1996. In conjunction with his annual golf tournament, celebrity softball game and fundraising dinners, the foundation has donated more than $2&nbsp;million to charities in his home state of Mississippi as well as to those in his adopted state of Wisconsin.<ref name=FourwardFoundation>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialbrettfavre.com/fourward_foundation/|title=The Brett Favre Fourward Foundation|accessdate=February 7, 2007}}</ref>

The Favre family also owns and operates the Brett Favre's Steakhouse, located in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[Wisconsin]].<ref name=Steakhouse>{{cite web|url=http://www.brettfavressteakhouse.com/|title=Brett Favre's Steakhouse|publisher=Brett Favre's Steakhouse|accessdate=January 3, 2008}}</ref>

Favre made a cameo appearance in the [[1998 in film|1998]] [[romantic comedy film]] ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' as [[Cameron Diaz]]'s character's love interest.

Favre is a spokesperson for many products, including [[Snapper Inc.]], [[Wrangler Jeans]] and [[Sears]]. In the Sears ads, Favre pokes fun at himself for his constant waffling between retirement and continuing his playing career by debating whether or not to buy a plasma screen TV, saying "I'll take it... Nah, I don't know". In another ad he has a conversation with a Blue Crew associate who says of the TV, "some guys just can't make up their minds" to which Favre replies "Yeah, I hate those guys."  In a [[Hyundai]] commercial with a similar theme, he accepts the 2020 NFL MVP award, with fully gray hair, saying "When you're playing at 50, and you're older than the fans, coaches, and owners, well... I should probably retire after this... But I don't know."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=brett+favre+commercial&search_type=&aq=f|title=brett favre commercial|publisher=YouTube|date=|accessdate=April 3, 2010}}</ref>
