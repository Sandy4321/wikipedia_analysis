Coker grew up in Linden, New Jersey and became an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] in Troop 32 of Saint Elizabeth's [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] in Linden on [[January 27]], [[1959]]. His passion for Scouting is one of the things that got him through his 6 1/2 years as a POW in North Vietnam, and he states that it is what got him through his darkest days in the POW camps &ndash; to the point that at times all he could remember was the [[Scout Promise|Scout Oath]], but not even the names of his family members.<ref name="beacon">{{cite book | last = Brinkley | first = Robin | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Lesson In Distinction | edition = The Beacon (supplement) | publisher = The Virginian Pilot | location = Virginia Beach, VA | pages = pp. cover, 12-13 | id = }} Aug 4, 2005</ref><ref name="awardspeech">Award speech by George Thomas Coker accepting his Distinguished Eagle Scout Award, Aug 9, 2005, Norfolk Waterside Marriott, Norfolk, Virginia.</ref> Coker is a former long-time [[scoutmaster]] of Troop 62 in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], where he has lived since the 1970s, and a [[Honors and awards of the Order of the Arrow|Vigil Honor]] member of the [[Order of the Arrow]] (OA).

==Military service==
[[Image:GeorgeCokerMarch1973.jpg|thumb|right|George Thomas Coker shortly after his release from the POW camps in North Vietnam; March 1973.]]
Coker served as a naval aviation officer for 23 years in the U.S. Navy from 1963&ndash;1986. He was serving as a Bombardier&ndash;Navigator of an A-6A Intruder from squadron VA-65 operating from the [[USS Constellation (CV-64)]], when he and his pilot, John H. "Jack" Fellowes, were shot down over North Vietnam on [[August 27]], [[1966]]. He was not released until [[March 4]], [[1973]]. During his captivity, he was, and still is, recognized as a leader of the POW resistance movement. Coker was one of the fiercest resistors of his captors. <ref name="mccain">Senator [[John McCain]]'s letter of endorsement to Coker's Distinguished Eagle Scout nomination, June 1, 2005.</ref> In a scene from the 1997 movie ''Faith of Our Fathers'', a biography of Senator [[John McCain]], McCain's character attempts to memorize the names of fellow POWs.

Coker was considered one of "the baddest of the baddest" of the POWs, a reference to his fierce resistance to his captivity.<ref name="baddest">{{cite web | last = Larson | first = Col.

They swam down the [[Red River (Vietnam)|Red River]], hid in the mud, and were recaptured 12 1/2 hours later.<ref name="escape">{{cite web | last = Coker | first = George Thomas | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =  1977 | url = http://www.pownetwork.org/bios/c/c089.htm | title = POWNet record of George Thomas Coker | format = | work = | publisher = POWNet | accessdate = 22 June | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>  Coker received the [[Navy Cross]] for his action; the citation reads in part:

:''...for extraordinary heroism during an extremely daring escape from a solitary confinement cell while a Prisoner of War in Hanoi, North Vietnam on 12 October 1967. During a period of particularly harsh treatment, Lieutenant Commander Coker and another prisoner executed an escape as a two-man team despite the high risk of brutal reprisal or possible loss of life. That night, after opening the cell door by removing door bolt brackets from inside the room, he proceeded over the wall and through several blocks of housing to the Domer Bridge. Walking under the bridge to the Red River's edge, he swam downstream all night and at sunrise buried himself in a mudbank in an effort to remain concealed. He was later discovered, recaptured, severely beaten for many hours, and banished to solitary confinement for two and a half years.''

Vietnam&ndash;era POWs were released in order of capture. Fellowes and Coker were in the second large release group and were about #123 and #124.<ref name="release">Phone interview between George Thomas Coker and Randy Everette, [[May 5]], [[2005]].</ref> Of their 2,382 days in captivity (6 1/2 years), 2 1/2 years were in solitary confinement and 2 1/2 years in the "Hanoi Hilton". They also spent time in several other POW camps around Hanoi.

Coker's return to his hometown after leaving Vietnam can be seen in the 1974 [[documentary film|documentary]] ''[[Hearts and Minds (film)|Hearts and Minds]]''.
