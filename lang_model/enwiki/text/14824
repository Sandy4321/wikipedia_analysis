The '''Grumman XP-50''' was a land-based development of the shipboard [[XF5F Skyrocket|F5F-1 Skyrocket]] fighter, entered into a [[USAAC]] contest for a twin-engine heavy [[interceptor]]. It was assigned the model number G-46 by the builder, [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman]]. The [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] placed an order for a [[prototype]] on [[25 November]] [[1939]] designating it '''XP-50''', but it lost the competition to the [[P-38 Lightning|XP-38]].

==Design and development==
The XP-50 design was similar to that of the XF5F-1 with modifications to the fuselage nose to house the nose-wheel of the tricycle landing gear and provisions for [[self-sealing fuel tank]]s and pilot armor. The planned armament was two 20&nbsp;mm cannon and two 50&nbsp;caliber (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns.

==Testing==
The first and last flight of the XP-50 was on [[14 May]] [[1941]], falling victim to a turbo-supercharger explosion that destroyed the aircraft.

Based upon experience with the XF5F-1 and the XP-50, Grumman had begun work on a more advanced fighter, designated model G-51. Thus, the A.A.C. decided to replace the XP-50 with the newer design and recommended procurement of two G-51s, designated '''XP-65''', using the original XP-50 expenditure order to cover the development. Consideration was given to combining the Air Corps and Navy requirements into a common design, but the weight and performance penalties inherent in conflicting requirements were considered great enough that separate designs would be needed. But, since the Navy considered Grumman one of its major production sources and that producing two different model aircraft by Grumman would impede manufacture of aircraft types the US Navy needed, it was decided that development of the [[F7F Tigercat|XF7F-1]] would continue, and the [[Grumman XP-65|XP-65]] as a parallel development was abandoned.
