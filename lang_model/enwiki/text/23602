}}'''Muhammad bin Qasim Al-Thaqafi''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''<U+0645><U+062D><U+0645><U+062F> <U+0628><U+0646> <U+0642><U+0627><U+0633><U+0645>''') (c. [[695]]&ndash;[[715]]) was a [[Syrian]] [[Arab]] general who conquered the [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] regions along the [[Indus River|Indus river]] (now a part of [[Pakistan]]). The conquest of Sindh and Punjab began the [[Islamic]] era in [[South Asia]].

== Life and Career ==
'''Muhammad bin Qasim bin Ukail Sakifi''' was born around 695. His father died when he was young, leaving Qasim's mother in charge of his education. [[Umayyad]] governor [[Al-Hajjaj bin Yousef]] was one of Qasim's close relatives, and was instrumental in teaching Qasim about warfare and governing. Qasim is known for his expansion of the Umayyad Caliphate to the east by adding Sindh and parts of Punjab.

Under Hajjaj's patronage, Qasim was made governor of [[Persian Empire|Persia]], where he succeeded in putting down a rebellion. At the age of seventeen, he was sent by [[Caliph]] [[Al-Walid I]] to lead an army towards India into what is today the [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] area of [[Pakistan]]. 
===Umayyad Interest in Sindh===
The primary reason for the Umayyad interest in the region is however viewed as the operation of the ''Mids'' and other who earlier preyed upon [[Sassanid]] and now [[Arab]] shipping from the mouth of the [[Tigris river]] to [[Sri Lanka]]n coast in their ''bawarij'' from [[Kutch]], Debal and [[Kathiawar]].<ref name="wink1"> Wink, pg.164</ref> With the rising importance of commercial traffic along the [[Persian Gulf]] route these cities had to be subjugated to safeguard the increasing important India trade from piracy. Sindh at this time was the wild frontier region of al-Hind inhabited largely by predatory semi-nomadic tribes whose activities disturbed much of the Western [[Indian Ocean]]. Muslim sources insist that it was this persistent insolence of Debal pirates and other lairs which forced the Arabs to subjugate the area to control the seaports and maritime routes of which Sindh was the hinge as well the overland pass-way.<ref> Wink, 51-52</ref> During Hajjaj's governorship the "Mids of Debal" kidnapped Muslim women travelling from Sri Lanka to Arabia providing a [[casus belli]] for the rising power of the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliph]]ate with a chance to gain a foothold in the [[Makran]], [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] and [[Sindh]] regions and put and end to piratical activity.<ref name="wink1"/><ref name="Gier"> Nicholas F. Gier, ''FROM MONGOLS TO MUGHALS: RELIGIOUS VIOLENCE IN INDIA 9TH-18TH CENTURIES'', Presented at the Pacific Northwest Regional Meeting American Academy of Religion, Gonzaga University, May, 2006[http://www.class.uidaho.edu/ngier/mm.htm]</ref>Through conquest, it meant to protect its maritime interests, cut off fleeing both rebel chieftains and Sindhi support to non-Muslim Persians such as in various battles such as [[Nahawand]], [[Jat Regiment|Salasal]] and [[Battle of al-Q<U+0101>disiyyah|Q<U+0101>disiyyah]].

===The Campaign as recounted in the Chach-Nama===
[[Image:QASIM.PNG|thumb|300px|Extent and expansion of [[Abassid]] rule under Muhammad bin Qasim (modern state boundaries shown in red).]]
The [[Chach Nama]] is the oldest chronicle of the [[Muslim conquests|Arab conquest]] of Sindh. It was translated into [[Persian language|Persian]] by Muhammad Ali bin Hamid bin Abu Bakr Kufi in 1216 CE.<ref>[[Common Era]] year is an approximation of the [[Islamic calendar]] date 613 AH.</ref> from an earlier Arabic text believed to have been composed by the Sakif<U+00ED> family, the kinsmen of Muhammad bin Qasim. At one time it was considered to be a [[Romance (genre)|romance]] until [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]]'s observations of it's historical veracity.

Qasim's expedition was the second, the first had failed due to stiffer than anticipated opposition as well as heat, exhaustion and scurvy. 

Qasim was successful, rapidly taking all of Sindh and moving into southern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] up to [[Multan]] with a regiment of 6,000 Syrian soldiers. 

Hajjaj had put more care and planning into this campaign than the first campaign under Badil bin Tuhfa.  Qasim was supported by [[Abdullah Shah Ghazi|Abdulla bin Nahban]]. In [[711]], Qasim first established his base at the Ummayyad controlled Arman Belah ([[Lasbela]]) in [[Makran]] and from there proceeded to assault [[Debal]]. Following the orders of Al-Hajjaj, he exacted a bloody retribution on Debal while freeing the kidnapped pilgrams as well as prisoners from the earlier failed campaign. From Debal he then moved on to Nerun to resupply.<ref> The [[Indus River]] during this time used to flow to the east of Nerun. An earthquake at in the 10th century caused it to change course to what it is currently.</ref>  Here, Nerun's Buddhist governor had acknowledged his city as a tributary of the [[Caliphate]] after the first campaign and opened the gates to their forces. From there, Qasim's armies then moved to capture Siwistan ([[Sehwan]]) and joined into an alliance with various tribal chiefs and secured the surrounding regions.  With his new allies, he captured the fort at Sisam and secured the remaining regions to the west of the Mehran ([[Indus River]]). At this point, the soldiers of the Qasim expedition had to resort to using soaked cotton with vinegar to suck on as a [[prophylaxis]] against scurvy and send for new horses, due to losses by disease and the campaign.

[[Raja Dahir|Dahir]] attempted to prevent Qasim from crossing the [[Indus river]] by moving his forces to its eastern banks.  However, Qasim successfully completed the crossing and defeated an attempt to repel him by Jaisiah, the son of Dahir, around the vicinity of Jitor. He then advanced onward to Raor ([[Nawabshah]]) in 712, where Dahir was defeated and died in battle.

Qasim's forces then marched upon Raor and took it, where it is noted in the Chach Nama that Dahir's wife Bai and some others committed [[Jauhar]]. He then made his way toward [[Mansura (Brahmanabad)|Brahmanabad]] where Jaisiah had invested himself and was gathering troops. Enroute he took the forts at Bahror, which he besieged for two months, and Dahlelah, where he captured Jaisiah's [[wazir]] who then defected to Qasim. When Qasim arrived at Brahmanabad, Jaisiah who had based himself there moved out and Qasim besieged the city for six months. The town was taken when a faction came over to Qasim and opened the gates. Here a report tells of the capture of another of Dahir's wives, Ladi, whom Qasim later married, and of the two daughters of Dahir from a third wife, who were sent on to the [[Khalifa]] as war booty. At Brahmanabad Qasim began to organize the administration of the lands before marching onward to the capital Alor ([[Aror]]), while consolidating his hold on the region and accepting pledges of allegiance, without encountering any significant resistance enroute. Aror was governed by one of Dahir's sons who fled to join his brothers and the city surrendered without much fighting. From here Qasim advanced northward to [[Multan]] and after crossing the [[Beas River]] began to encounter resistance once again from the local rulers at the forts of Golkondah, Sikkah and finally [[Multan]]. Jaisiah after attempting to raise support in [[Rajasthan]] fled to exile in [[Kashmir]]. 

Qasim was preparing to march upon [[Kanauj]] when he received a summons from the [[Khalifa]], thereby ending his campaign.

==Military Strategy==
The military strategy outlined by Hajjaj to Qasim in a letter:<ref name="Derryl1"> Derryl pg. 37-39 </ref>
{{cquote|My ruling is given:Kill anyone belonging to the combatants (''ahl-i-harb''); arrest their sons and daughters for hostages and imprison them. Whoever does not fight against us..grant them ''aman'' (safety) and settle their tribute(''amwal'') as ''dhimmah''.}}

The first Arab concern was to facilitate the conquest of Sindh with the least number of casualties while also trying to preserve the economic infrastructure.<ref name="Derryl1"/> Towns were given two options; submit to Arab authority peacefully or be attacked by force (''anwattan''), with the choice governing the Arab response upon capture.<ref name="Derryl1"/> Capture of towns was then usually accomplished by means of a treaty with a party from among the "enemy", who were then extended special privileges and material rewards.<ref name="Wink"/> There were two types of such treaties, "''Sulh''" or "''ahd-e-wasiq'' (capitulation)" and "''aman'' (surrender/ peace)".<ref name="Wink"/> Upon the capture of towns and fortresses, Qasim performed executions as part of his military strategy, but they were limited to the "''ahl-i-harb (fighting men)''" - whose surviving dependents were also enslaved.<ref name="Wink"/> Hence when resistance was strong, prolonged and intensive resulting in considerable Arab casualties his response was equally intensive; a three day long massacre at Daybul, 6,000 at Rawar, between 6,000 and 26,000 at Brahmanabad, 4,000 at Iskalandah and  6,000 at Multan. Conversely places taken by ''sulh'' such as Armabil, Nirun, Siwistan, Budhiyah, Bet, Sawandi and Aror where resistance was light few if any casualties occurred.<ref name="Derryl2"/> Sulh appeared to be Qasims preferred mode of conquest, accounting for between 63-65% of the towns and tribes recorded by Baladhuri or the Chachnama.<ref name="Derryl2"/> He was even berated by Hajjaj for being too lenient and therefore risked being considered by all as weak.<ref name="Derryl2"/> Pardon or ''aman'' was also granted to the common folk, who were encouraged to coutinue working, while the [[Brahmin]]s and [[Shramana]]'s continued to be employed as administrators.<ref name="Wink"/> While upon express orders of Hajjaj this option was not to be granted any inhabitant of Daybul, Qasim still bestowed it upon certain groups and indivuals.<ref name="Derryl2"/>

===Political Strategy===
After each major phase of his conquest, Qasim stopped to establish law and order in the newly-conquered territory by showing religious tolerance and incorporating the ruling class into his administration.<ref name="Wink"> Wink. pg. 204-206</ref> 
{{sect-stub}}

===Reasons for Success===

He succeeded partly because [[Raja Dahir]] was an unpopular Hindu king that ruled over a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] majority.<ref name="Gier"> Nicholas F. Gier, ''FROM MONGOLS TO MUGHALS: RELIGIOUS VIOLENCE IN INDIA 9TH-18TH CENTURIES'', Presented at the Pacific Northwest Regional Meeting American Academy of Religion, Gonzaga University, May, 2006[http://www.class.uidaho.edu/ngier/mm.htm]</ref> The forces of Muhammad bin Qasim defeated [[Raja Dahir]] in alliance with the lower caste [[Jat]]s and other Buddhist governors. His campaign's success is ascribed to the  support of Buddhists and the lower caste [[Jat]]s, [[Meds (tribe)|Meds]] and [[Bhutto (tribe)|Bhutto]] tribes.<ref> "The fall of Multan laid the Indus valley at the feet of the conqueror. The tribes came in, 'ringing bells and beating drums and dancing,' in token of welcome. The Hindu rulers had oppressed them heavily, and the Jats and Meds and other tribes were on the side of the invaders. The work of conquest, as often happened in India, was thus aided by the disunion of the inhabitants, and jealousies of race and creed conspired to help the Muslims. To such suppliants Mohammad Kasim gave the liberal terms that the Arabs usually offered to all but inveterate foes. He imposed the customary poll-tax, took hostages for good conduct, and spared the people's lands and lives. He even left their shrines undesecrated: 'The temples,' he proclaimed, 'shall be inviolate, like the churches of the Christians, the synagogues of the Jews, and the altars of the Magians.'"

New York, 1970. p. 9-10 </ref>  [[Chach of Alor]] and his kin were regarded as usurpers of the [[Rai Dynasty]]),<ref name="Gier">* Nicholas F. Gier, ''FROM MONGOLS TO MUGHALS: RELIGIOUS VIOLENCE IN INDIA 9TH-18TH CENTURIES'', Presented at the Pacific Northwest Regional Meeting American Academy of Religion, Gonzaga University, May, 2006 [http://www.class.uidaho.edu/ngier/mm.htm], Last accessed September 30 2006</ref> and rebels formed the infantry to his primarily cavalry force that first arrived at Arman Belah. His army at Multan was reported in the Tarikh Masumi at 50,000, of which only 6,000 came with Qasim. 

Along with this were:
# Superior Military equipment ([[siege engines]]<ref>The Chach-nama make special reference to one particular [[catapult]] called "(trans.) the small bride" which required 500 men to operate.</ref> and the [[Mongol bow]])<ref name="Gier"/>
# Troop discipline and leadership <ref name="Gier"/>
# The concept of [[jihad]] as morale booster <ref name="Gier"/>
# A large Buddhist population unhappy with their Hindu rulers <ref name="Gier"/>
# Positive response by Qasim to overtures of surrender and an avoidance of excessive bloodshed and destruction. <ref name="Gier"/>
# Ready support from the lower [[caste]] races; the [[Jat]]s and [[Med]]s formed the [[infantry]] to the predominantly [[cavalry]] army that came with Qasim.<ref name="Gier"/>
# The role played by the belief in prophecy; both of Muslim success, and Dahir's marriage (unconsummated) to his sister which alienated him from others.<ref> The Chach-Nama.

== Administration by Qasim ==

Qasim's task was seen as administrator was to set up an administrative structure for a stable Muslim state that incorporated a newly conquered alien land, inhabited by non-Muslims<ref name="Appleby292"> Appleby. pg. 291-292</ref> He adopted a concilatory policy, resulting in the acceptance of Muslim rule by the natives in return for non-interference in their religious practice.<ref name="Appleby292"/> He established Islamic [[Sharia]] law over the people of the region, however Hindu's were allowed to rule their villages and settle their disputes according to their own laws<ref name="Gier"/> and traditional hierarchical structures such as those of Village Headmen (''Rais''), Chieftains (''dihqans'') were maintained<ref name="Appleby292"/>. A Muslim officer called an ''amil'' was stationed with a troop of cavalry to manage each town; on a heridatary basis <ref name="Appleby292"/>

The <U+201C>[[Chach-Nama]]<U+201D> notes the following as highlights of Qasim<U+2019>s rule:
* He permitted all to practice their religion freely.<ref name="Gier"/><ref name="Mirza"> The Chach-Nama. English translation by Mirza Kalichbeg Fredunbeg. Delhi Reprint, 1979.[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=12701030&ct=3 Online Version last accessed 30 September 2006]</ref>
* Hindus were included in the [[Ahl al Kitab]] <ref name="Gier"/>
* the status of [[Dhimmi]]s (protected people) was conferred upon [[Hindu]]s and [[Buddhist]]s <ref name="Gier"/>

===Taxation===
Everywhere taxes (''mal'') and tribute (''kharaj'') were settled and hostages taken - occasionally this also meant the custodians of temples.<ref name="Wink"/> One-fifth of the slaves and booty taken were sent on to Hajjaj<ref name="Wink"/> as both treasure and to repay the Caliph for his outlay in outfitting the campaign. As a whole, the non-Muslim populations of conquered territories were treated as [[People of the Book]] and granted [[Hindu]], [[Jain]] and [[Buddhist]] religions the freedom to practice their faith in return for payment of the poll tax ([[jizya]]). <ref name="Gier"/> They were then excused from military service or payment of the tax paid by Muslim subjects - [[Zakat]].<ref name="Appleby292"/> The jizya enforced was a graded tax, being heaviest on the elite and lightest on the poor.<ref name="Appleby292"/>

===Incorporation of ruling elite into administration===
During his administration Hindus and Buddhists were inducted into the administration as trusted advisors and governors.<ref name="Gier"/> A Hindu, Kaksa, was the second most important person in his administration.<ref>H. M. Elliot and John Dowson, ''The History of India as Told by Its Own Historians'', (London, 1867-1877), vol. 1, p.  203. "Kaksa took precedence in the army before all the nobles and commanders.  He collected the revenue of the country and the treasury was placed under his seal.  He assisted Muhammad ibn Qasim in all of his undertakings..."</ref> Dahir's prime minister and various chieftains were also incorporated into the administration.<ref>The Chach-Nama. English translation by Mirza Kalichbeg Fredunbeg. Delhi Reprint, 1979. [http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=12701030&ct=3 Online Version last accessed 3 October 2006]</ref>

==Religion==
No mass conversions were attempted.<ref name="Schimmel">Schimmel pg.4</ref> The destruction of temples such as the Sun Temple at Multan<ref name="Schimmel"/> was forbidden and 3% of the government revenue was allocated to the Brahmins.<ref name="Gier"/>

A small minority who converted to Islam and were granted exemption from slavery and the [[jizya]].<ref name="Appleby292"/> Mosques were built, prayers held and coins struck in the name of the Caliph. The people of Sindh were allowed to repair damaged temples and construct new ones.<ref name="Appleby292"/>

An eccelastical office "''sadru-I-Islam al affal"'' was created to oversee the secular governors.<ref name="Appleby292"/> While [[proslytization]] occurred, the social dynamics of Sind were no different from other Muslim regions such as [[Egypt]], where conversion to Islam was slow and took centuries, and generally came from among the ranks of Buddhists.<ref name="Appleby292"/>

== Death ==
Qasim had begun preparations for further expansions when [[Al-Hajjaj bin Yousef]] died, as did Caliph [[Al-Walid I]] who was succeeded by [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik]]. Once Hajjaj, Qasim<U+2019>s father-in-law and a notoriously brutal governor of Iraq died, the new governor took revenge against all who were close to Hajjaj. Hajjaj had pursued a systematic to break [[Umayyad]] power and with them the ''[[Azd]]i'' who under [[Mohalib]] had grown powerful in the eastern regions of the empire also suffered. Sulayman owed political support to opponents of Hajjaj and so recalled both of Hajjaj's successful generals [[Qutaibah bin Muslim]] and Qasim. He also appointed [[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]], once tortured by Hajjaj and a son of Mohalib, as the governor of [[Fars]], [[Kirman]], [[Makran]] and [[Sindh]] who placed Qasim in chains.<ref> Wink, pg. 53</ref>

There are two accounts on the details of fate of Qasim, but both agree that he was recalled by the new caliph Sulayman.<br> 

#The account from the Chach Nama narrates a tale in which the Khalifa had been tricked into ordering Qasims recall by the daughters of [[Raja Dahir]]'s. Upon having been taken captive they were sent on as presents to the Khalifa, whom they convinced into believing that Qasim had violated them before sending them on. As result of this subterfuge Qasim was wrapped in oxen hides and returned to [[Syria]] resulting in his death enroute, from suffocation. This narrative attributes the motive as one securing vengeance for their father's death. Upon discovering this subterfuge the Khalifa is recorded to have been filled with remorse and ordering the sisters be buried alive in a wall.<ref> The Chach-Nama. English translation by Mirza Kalichbeg Fredunbeg. Delhi Reprint, 1979.[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=12701030&ct=24 Online Version Last acceesed 15 May 2007]</ref><ref name="keay185"> Keay, pg. 185 </ref>
# The [[Persian people|Persian]] historian [[Baladhuri]]'s account states that the khalifa was a political enemy of Hajjaj and recalled Qasim after Hajjaj's death and imprisoned him where Qasim is reported to have died at the age of twenty under torture.<ref name="Gier"/><ref name="keay185"/>

==Controversy==
{{Expand-section|date=January 2007}}
The is considerably controversy on the topics of conversion and conquest of Sindh voiced in two antagonistic perspectives have resulted in a polemical debate.<ref name="Derryl2"> Derryl pg.22-29 </ref>
#)''Coercive Conversion'' has been attributed to early British administrator historians such as Elliot and Cousens and Indian nationalists such as Majumdar and Vaidya.<ref name="Derryl2"/> This holds the view that conversion in Arab Sind was necessarily forced as a direct consequence of the presumed violent nature of Islam and explains examples of religious toleration as accommodation due to Arab weakness due to numerical inferiority and Arab killings in various battles and temple destructions as a reflection of religiously motivated intolerance.<ref name="Derryl2"/>
#) To Indian Muslims like Habib and Pakistani Nationalists like Qureishi the conquest was largely and the conversion wholly peaceful.<ref name="Derryl2"/>

Elliot perceived Islam as a religion of "terror, devastation, murder and rapine" where the conquering Arabs were characterized as "ruthless bigots" and "furious zealots" motivated by "plunder and prosletism".<ref name="Derryl2"/> The period of bin-Qasim's rule has been called by  U.T. Thakkur as "The darkest period in Sind history" with the records speaking of massive forced conversions, temple destruction, slaughters and genocides<ref name="Thakkur">Sindhi Culture by U.T. Thakkur, University of Bombay 1959</ref> where the people of Sind, who being described as inherently pacifist at the time had to re-adjust to the conditions of "barbarian inroad".<ref name="Thakkur"/> Descriptions interpreted by Thakkur also entailed "frightful outbreaks of religious bigotry in several places and temples were wantonly desecrated" during bin-Qasim's rule, and that Muslim travelers often extorted resources from Hindus by legal mandate<ref>Sindhi Culture by U.T. Thakkur, University of Bombay 1959 P15</ref> or as attesting to forced conversions imparted on the native Sindhis by bin-Qasim including a systematic depopulation of the region. Some historians strike a middle ground, saying that bin-Qasim was torn between the political expediency of making peace with the Hindus and Buddhists; having to call upon non-Muslims to serve under him as part of his mandate to administer newly conquered land; and orthodoxy by refraining from seeking the co-operation of "infidels". It is contended that bin-Qasim may have struck a middle ground, conferring the status of [[Dhimmi]] upon the native Sindhis and permitting them to participate in his administration, but treating them as "noncitizens" i.e. in the [[Khilafat]], but not of it.<ref name="Appleby292"/>.

== Legacy ==
*Qasim's presence and rule was very brief. His conquest for the [[Umayyad]]s brought [[Sindh]] into the gambit of the Muslim world <ref name="Markovits"> Markovits, Claude ''The Global World of Indian Merchants, 1750-1947: Traders of Sind from Bukhara to Panama'', Cambridge University Press, Jun 22, 2000, ISBN 0-521-62285-9, pg. 34. </ref>

*The next Arab governor died on arrival, and Dahir<U+2019>s son Jaisimha recaptured Brahmanabad and c.720 was granted pardon and inclusion in the administration in return for converting to Islam but soon recanted and split off when the Umayyads were embroiled in a succession crisis. Later [[Junaid Ibn Abdur Rahman al-Marri]] killed Jaisimha and recaptured the territory before his successors once again struggled to hold and keep it. During the [[Abassid]] period c.870 the local [[Amir]]s shook off all allegiance to the caliphs and by the 10th century the region was split into two weak states, [[Mansura (Brahmanabad)|Mansurah]] on the lower Indus and [[Multan]] on the upper Indus; which was soon captured by [[Ismailis]] who set up an independent [[Fatimid]] state and destroyed an old and historic temple in Multan that bin Qasim had protected and built a mosque in its place.<ref name="Gier"/><ref> Keay, pg 186-187</ref> These successor states did not achieve much and shrank in size.
