A '''general election''' will be held in [[Elections in New Zealand|New Zealand]] on November 8, 2008 to determine the composition of the [[49th New Zealand Parliament]], and thus the makeup of the government of [[New Zealand]] for the three years to 2011. Since [[New Zealand general election, 1999|1999]], the [[social democracy|social democratic]] [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] led by [[Helen Clark]] has dominated various, mainly minority, governments (first with the [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance]]; since [[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002]] with the [[New Zealand Progressive Party|Progressive Party]]; and since [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005]] also supported by other parties outside coalition). If Labour can form a government after this election, they will start a fourth consecutive term in office. As at every election since [[New Zealand general election, 1938|1938]], Labour will compete for votes against the centre-right [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], headed on this occasion by [[John Key]]. Labour and National will have to defend their share of the seats in parliament from the threats of other parties, which, by the 2008 election, occupy over a sixth of the seats.

New Zealand uses the [[Mixed Member Proportional]] system to elect a 120 member [[New Zealand Parliament|parliament]]; seventy of the new members will represent geographic communities of roughly 57,000, and the remaining fifty MPs will come from [[party list]]s. New Zealanders regularly cast between a fifth and a third of their votes for parties other than Labour or National (the proportion achieved a high of 37.8 percent in [[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002]]). This, combined with the fact that a party has not won an absolute majority of votes cast since [[New Zealand general election, 1951|1951]], implies a high probability that any major party will have to seek accommodations with "third" parties in order to form a government. The current minority government has fifty seats in the House of Representatives, eleven short of an absolute majority; an agreement with [[New Zealand First]] (seven seats), another agreement with [[United Future New Zealand|United Future]] (two seats), and a third with the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] (six seats) affords the government the [[confidence and supply]] that it needs to remain in office.

==Dates ==
New Zealand elections traditionally occur after September in the third year following the last election; [[snap election]]s occur rarely; the only three elections out of sync in the last sixty years took place in [[New Zealand general election, 1951|1951]], [[New Zealand general election, 1984|1984]] and [[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002]], and the last two came only a few months early. [[constitutional convention (political custom)|Convention]] in New Zealand expects Parliaments to run for a full three years unless the government loses the [[Motion of Confidence|confidence]] of the House, although this has not happened in the modern political era.<!-- Q: when did it last happen? A: In 1911, when the Reform government fell. Thus, outside the modern political era-->

The [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1986|Constitution Act 1986]] defines the term of Parliament as "three years from the day fixed for the return of the writs issued for the last preceding general election of members of the House of Representatives, and no longer." Since the writs for the 2005 election were returned on 6 October 2005,<ref>[[New Zealand Electoral Commission]]: Post-election deadlines - Election '05 [http://www.elections.org.nz/voting/ec-post-election-deadlines.html Source]</ref> the current Parliament will expire on 6 October 2008, making the final possible date for the general election 15 November 2008.

On Friday [[12 September]] [[2008]], Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] announced that the general election would be held on [[8 November]] [[2008]].
The full election timetable is:
* Dissolution of parliament - Friday, 3 October.
* [[Writ of election|Writ day]] - Wednesday, 8 October.
* [[Nomination]]s day - Tuesday, 14 October.
* Election day - Saturday, 8 November.
* Official results declared and writs returned by Saturday, 22 November.
* The [[49th New Zealand Parliament|49th Parliament]] must convene no later than Saturday 3 January 2009.<ref>Clark sets election date: November 8[http://www.stuff.co.nz/4690355a6160.html]</ref>

the Government disclosed its full fiscal situation; it showed that it expected to take $3.1 billion less tax in 2009, forcing the government to borrow $5.9 billion in 2009, rising to $7.3 billion by 2013. This will mean higher costs for KiwiSaver, Working For Families, the 20 hours free early-childhood plan, and higher numbers of people forced onto benefits by any prospective economic downturn. Over the next fiscal year, [[GDP]] is expected to rise by just 0.1%, while median house prices drop by an estimated 10-15%.<ref name="stuff_cullen_speech">

=== "This election is about trust" ===
See also ''[[Electoral Finance Act]]'' and ''[[2005 New Zealand election funding controversy]]''

On calling the 2008 election, Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] declared that it would be about "trust", <ref name="nzh_clark_teiat"> {{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10531965&ref=rss |title=Poll all about trust, says Clark  |date=2008-09-13|accessdate=2008-09-25 |publisher=New Zealand Herald}}</ref> saying that National's recent commitments to preserve Labour party programmes such as [[KiwiSaver]] and [[Kiwibank]] were "insincere". Clark's statement follows on several leaked recordings from the National Party's annual conference in early August where deputy party leader [[Bill English]] was caught saying that the National Party would like to sell Kiwibank "eventually but not now". <ref name="stuff_nzh_english_oops">

Key's troubles increased when John Key was accused of lying about his shareholding in [[Tranz Rail]], by not disclosing nearly half of the shares he and his family trusts owned in the company, even though this presented a clear conflict of interest with Key's role as his party's spokesperson on transport, in which time he asked several questions in the House about the government's plans regarding rail infrastructure. <ref name="tv3_how_many_shares">{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/JohnKeyaccusedoflyingaboutTransrailshares/tabid/419/articleID/72792/Default.aspx?ArticleID=72792 |title=John Key accused of lying about Transrail shares  |date=2008-09-23|accessdate=2008-09-25 |publisher=TV3}}</ref> 

The National Party did not face allegations of secrecy alone: [[New Zealand First]] leader [[Winston Peters]] faced a two-pronged attack on his party's credibility, first over allegations that his party did not declare a $100,000 donation from millionaire ex-patriate property developer [[Owen Glenn]] to cover Winston Peters' legal costs in a challenge to the result in the seat of [[tauranga (NZ electorate)|Tauranga]].  This was referred to a jury of Peters' peers in the form of the powerful House of Representatives [[Privileges Committee]].

This case was referred to the [[Serious Fraud Office (New Zealand)|Serious Fraud Office]] for further investigation; on October 11, New Zealand First was cleared of charges that Peters called a "waste of time"<ref name="stuff_nzf_cleared">{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/vote08/4723109a28477.html|title=Peters cleared but PM keeps his portfolio   |date=2008-10-11|accessdate=2008-10-14 |publisher=stuff.co.nz}}</ref> and on [[October 24]], the New Zealand First party was cleared of any wrong doing by the Electoral Commission, which was investigating donations that the party failed to declare. <ref name="onenews_nzf_cleared">{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/576182/2227446|title=Peters buoyed by donations ruling}}</ref>.

===The Child Discipline Act ===
{{update}}
{{mainarticle|Child Discipline Act}}

The Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993 allows any person to start a petition asking that a [[Referendums in New Zealand|national referendum]] be held. Once the Clerk of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] has approved the referendum question, 10% of registered voters must sign a petition before the authorities can authorise holding such a referendum. A movement exists for a referendum on the controversial [[Child Discipline Act]] of 2007; such referendum could theoretically take place on the same date as the election.<ref name="sst_ref">

as the Prime Minister has stated any referendum will occur using postal voting in 2009{{Fact|date=October 2008}}.

=== Labour's legacy ===
The Labour Party has authored several pieces of social legislation such as a long-term savings scheme called [[KiwiSaver]], a new education policy called [[Schools Plus]] and a family tax-credit scheme called [[Working for Families]]. John Key called the latter "a giant welfare package".<ref name="stuff_nzh_key_wff">
{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10523832&ref=rss |title=Key would now keep Working for Families |date=2008-07-28|accessdate=2008-08-05 |publisher=New Zealand Herald}}
</ref>
At the end of July 2008, Key announced a change in policy from his party, saying that no changes to Working For Families would now take place. Key went on to guarantee state ownership of [[KiwiRail]] (which the Government had re-purchased in mid-2008 after a period of 15 years in private hands) and [[Kiwibank]] for the next term of government.

==Electoral Finance Act==

The ''[[Electoral Finance Act]]'' passed by the Labour government has had a "chilling effect" on political activity this year, according to the [[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Electoral Commission blasts EFA <U+2013> again |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz-election-2008/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501799&objectid=10535383 |agency=NZPA |work=New Zealand Herald |publisher= |date=2008-10-02 |accessdate=2008-11-02 }}</ref>

== Electorates ==
=== Boundary changes ===

The Representation Commission altered many of the boundaries of New Zealand's parliamentary [[New Zealand electorates|electorates]] following the [[New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings|2006 Census]]; the large growth in population between censuses lead to significant boundary changes, particularly in Auckland, the area around Christchurch and the central North Island. In May 2007, the Representation Commission announced the boundary changes <ref name="elect_com">{{cite web| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10437554
|title=Auckland to get an extra seat in Parliament|author=[[New Zealand Herald]] }}
</ref>
to take effect for the next general election, with the boundaries finalised in September 2007. 

The Commission announced the formation of a new electorate in Greater Auckland, bringing the number of geographical constituencies to seventy. The new seat, originally dubbed "[[Howick, New Zealand|Howick]]" (after the Auckland suburb), would have included parts of the existing Pakuranga, Manukau East and Clevedon electorates.  After [[Pakuranga (NZ electorate)| Pakuranga]] electors made strong objections to the proposed changes (which would have seen the inclusion of the population centres [[Panmure]], [[Point England]] and [[Glen Innes]] into the electorate) the Commission largely reverted proposed changes to the boundaries of the [[Pakuranga (NZ electorate)|Pakuranga electorate]]. The Commission opted to alleviate population pressures by moving the Auckland City suburb of [[Otahuhu]] into [[Manukau East (NZ electorate)|Manukau East]]. The revised new seat received the name [[Botany (NZ electorate)| "Botany"]] to reflect its focus on the growing population-centres of [[Botany Downs, New Zealand|Botany Downs]]-[[Dannemora, New Zealand|Dannemora]]. On paper, Botany counts as a safe National seat.

Even though the number of South Island electorates remains fixed, the decline in the population of electorates south of [[Christchurch, New Zealand|Christchurch]] has resulted in the boundaries of electorates from [[Invercargill (New Zealand electorate)| Invercargill]] north to [[Rakaia (New Zealand electorate)| Rakaia shifting]] northwards. The seats of [[Aoraki (NZ electorate)|Aoraki]], [[Otago (NZ electorate)|Otago]], [[Rakaia (NZ electorate)|Rakaia]] and [[Banks Peninsula (NZ electorate)|Banks Peninsula]] all gravitated towards Christchurch. In the process:

* [[Aoraki (NZ electorate)|Aoraki]] received the new name of  [[Rangitata (NZ electorate)|Rangitata]]
* [[Otago (NZ electorate)|Otago]] received the new name of [[Waitaki (NZ electorate)|Waitaki]]
* [[Rakaia (NZ electorate)|Rakaia]] received the new name of [[Selwyn (NZ electorate)|Selwyn]]
* [[Banks Peninsula (NZ electorate)|Banks Peninsula]] received the new name of [[Port Hills (NZ electorate)|Port Hills]]

Other seats in the lower South Island increased dramatically in size.

=== The situation after 2005 ===
In 2005 four MPs won seats with majorities of under a thousand: Labour's [[Darren Hughes]] beat National candidate [[Nathan Guy]] in [[Otaki (NZ electorate)|<U+014C>taki]] by 382 votes (1.00%), and in [[Hamilton West (NZ electorate)|Hamilton West]], [[Martin Gallagher (politician)|Martin Gallagher]] of the Labour Party won an 825 vote majority (2.46%) over National's Tim Macindoe. Both of these seats will see a rematch in 2008. 

The swing to National in the central North Island saw two Bay of Plenty seats produce close results: in [[Rotorua (NZ electorate)|Rotorua]], the sitting Labour MP [[Stephanie Chadwick|Steve Chadwick]] prevailed by just 662 votes (2.17%) over National's  Gil Stehbens, and in [[Tauranga (NZ electorate)|Tauranga]], property developer [[Bob Clarkson]] defeated [[New Zealand First]]'s leader and seven-term MP for Tauranga [[Winston Peters]] by 730 votes (2.02%). In 2008, Chadwick will face diplomat [[Todd McClay]], while National has selected [[Simon Bridges]] to defend their 2005 gain against another challenge from Peters.

Besides the three Labour-held narrow-margin seats mentioned above (Otaki, Hamilton West and Rotorua), National has prospects of gaining [[Taup<U+014D> (NZ electorate)|Taup<U+014D>]], where boundary changes have added the National-leaning town of [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]] and with it nearly 20,000 different voters <U+2014> putting sitting MP [[Mark Burton]]'s 2005 majority of just 1,285 votes (4.43%) at risk. Similarly, the seat of [[West Coast-Tasman (NZ electorate)|West Coast-Tasman]] gave Labour's [[Damien O'Connor]] a majority of 2,154 (6.77%); if National experiences a larger swing in the seat in 2008, O'Connor could end up losing to National candidate and to the current list MP [[Chris Auchinvole]]. 

Part of National's core vote comes from provincial centres. In 1990, when Labour lost power, it lost every seat between the southern fringe of the Auckland urban area and Porirua except [[Palmerston North (NZ electorate)|Palmerston North]]; in 2005, National again won several provincial seats off Labour: 

# [[East Coast (New Zealand electorate)|East Coast]]
# [[Tukituki (New Zealand electorate)|Tukituki]]
# [[Napier (NZ electorate)|Napier]]
# [[Whanganui (NZ electorate)|Whanganui]]
# [[Hamilton East (NZ electorate)|Hamilton East]]
# [[Otago (NZ electorate)|Otago]]
# [[Aoraki (NZ electorate)|Aoraki]]

National also won Tauranga off New Zealand First leader Winston Peters and the lion's share of the ACT and United parties' core votes{{Fact|date=September 2008}} (and in the process gained [[Northcote (NZ electorate)|Northcote]] off Labour).

The newly-drawn seat of [[Botany (NZ electorate)|Botany]] on Auckland's eastern fringe could provide an electoral problem for Labour&mdash; on 4 July 2008, a crowd of mostly Asian marchers numbered in the thousands<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/4606304a6016.html|work=Eastern Courier | title=Clean, green but not safe |date=2008-07-05}}</ref> protested against Labour's record on crime and sentencing and a perceived upswing in anti-Asian crime. Because of the large Asian population in the new seat, such trends give National candidate [[Pansy Wong]] a possible advantage. Boundary changes have also shaken up the electoral landscape of the South Island.<ref name="elect_com">{{cite web| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10437554|title=Auckland to get an extra seat in Parliament|author=[[New Zealand Herald]] }}</ref> Three new seats - [[Selwyn (NZ electorate)|Selwyn]], [[Waitaki (NZ electorate)|Waitaki]] and [[Rangitata (NZ electorate)|Rangitata]], drawn respectively out of Aoraki, Otago and Rakaia, three National-held seats in 2005, could do damage to Labour's chances outside of Christchurch and Dunedin.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} 

On Labour's other flank, the three M<U+0101>ori seats that it held last time against a strong [[M<U+0101>ori Party]] challenge could fall like they did in 1996 when New Zealand First broke Labour's sixty-year stranglehold. [[Nanaia Mahuta]] will again face [[Angeline Greensill]] for the new [[Hauraki-Waikato]] seat, M<U+0101>ori affairs minister [[Parekura Horomia]] faces veteran broadcaster [[Derek Fox (New Zealand)|Derek Fox]] in [[Ikaroa-R<U+0101>whiti]] and incumbent [[Mahara Okeroa]] will face [[Rahui Katene]] in [[Te Tai Tonga]] in what could be a trying year for Labour.

The seats of [[Tauranga (New Zealand electorate)| Tauranga]] and [[Epsom (New Zealand electorate)| Epsom]] may provide particular resonances: unless [[Winston Peters]] re-takes the [[Marginal seat| marginal]] Tauranga, the [[New Zealand First Party]]'s chances of a return to the House probably depend on winning 5% of the party vote <U+2014> a potentially daunting task in the light of current opinion polling. Similarly, the electoral fortunes of the [[ACT New Zealand| ACT Party]] may depend very largely on [[Rodney Hide]] retaining Epsom. (Amongst other parties very aware of the 5% barrier, [[United Future New Zealand| United Future]] appears more secure in the light of [[Peter Dunne]]'s grip on [[<U+014C>hariu]], and the [[New Zealand Progressive Party| Progressive Party]] has a very strong hold via [[Jim Anderton]]'s "[[safe seat]]" of [[Wigram (New Zealand electorate)| Wigram]]. The [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand| Greens]] appear less in danger of slipping below the 5% threshold, and lack an obvious winnable electorate seat.)

== Opinion polling ==

[[Image:NZ opinion polls 2005-2008 new.png|thumb|Poll results for all political parties that have exceeded the 5% [[Mixed member proportional representation|MMP]] threshold.]]

''See: [[Opinion polling for the New Zealand general election, 2008]]''

Having come first in the party vote at the 2005 election by just two percentage points, Labour held a slender lead in aggregate polling through the first half of 2006; a two-point lead in the first half of the year turned into a two-point deficit by May. Preferred Prime Minister polling showed Helen Clark nearly twice as popular as then National Party leader [[Don Brash]].

Things changed in early 2007, when Labour MPs backed Green Party MP Sue Bradford's [[Child Discipline Act|bill amending the Crimes Act]], removing the legal defence of "reasonable force" for parents prosecuted for assaulting their children. By the start of 2007, new National leader [[John Key]] had improved on Brash's preferred Prime Minister rating by ten points, overtaking Clark as preferred Prime Minister in May; at the same time National jumped out to a sizable lead over Labour ranging from between eight and eighteen points, spending most of 2007 and 2008 with numbers around fifty percent.  Labour's popularity slumped, hitting its lowest point in the winter of 2008, before beginning a slow climb into the high thirties in August and September.

As at October 2008, polls have shown a diverse set of projections for election day; some suggesting Labour could form a coalition government, others putting National in control.  Of the "minor" parties, only the Green Party consistently polls over the five-percent threshold, with [[United Future New Zealand|United Future]] and the [[New Zealand Progressive Party|Progressive Party]] frequently failing to register a mention. Both [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]]'s and the [[M<U+0101>ori Party]]'s popularity since 2005 remains steady at around two percent, while [[New Zealand First]] has failed to poll over the threshold since December 2006. In preferred Prime Minister polling, the most recent polls have shown varied results: some giving Clark a slight lead, other giving Key a sturdy margin.

== Prospective coalitions==
Pundits have begun to speculate on the shape of the next government, particularly should no party get an absolute majority of seats in the House. [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] will support a National-led government.<ref name="act_rodneyspeech">
