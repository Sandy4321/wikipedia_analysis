'''Ram<U+00F3>n (Raymond) Ayala''' (born [[February 3]], [[1977]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]), known artistically as '''Daddy Yankee''', is a [[Latin Grammy Award]]-winning [[Puerto Rican]] [[reggaeton]] recording artist. Ayala was born in [[R<U+00ED>o Piedras, Puerto Rico|R<U+00ED>o Piedras]] the largest district of San Juan, where he became interested in music at a young age. In his youth he was interested in baseball, and aspired to become a Major League Baseball player. He was unable to continue this sport when he received an injury to one of his legs, leaving him unable to walk correctly. He then became involved in the [[underground rap]] movement that was in its early stages in Puerto Rico.  After receiving lessons from several artists within the genre, he developed an independent career, first recording in a production titled ''[[Playero 37]]''.  After this he began to produce independent albums.  His first solo album was ''[[No Mercy (Daddy Yankee album)|No Mercy]]''. He subsequently formed a duo with [[Nicky Jam]], and then continued his solo career with the releases of ''[[El Cartel (album)|El Cartel]]'' and ''[[El Cartel II]]''. 

In 2002 ''[[El Cangri.com]]'' became Ayala's first album with international success, receiving coverage in the markets of [[New York]] and [[Miami]]. ''[[Barrio Fino]]'' was released in 2004, and the album received numerous awards, including a [[Premio Lo Nuestro]] and a Latin Billboard, as well as receiving nominations for the Latin Grammy and [[MTV Video Music Awards]]. ''Barrio Fino'' performed well in the sales charts of the [[United States]], [[Latin America]], [[Europe]], and [[Japan]]. On [[June 5]], [[2007]], [[El Cartel Records]] released ''[[El Cartel: The Big Boss]]'', which was ranked as the top-selling album in Latin music genres in 2007.  He promoted the album with an international tour which began in the United States and continued through Latin America, breaking attendance records in [[Ecuador]] and [[Bolivia]]. His performances have appeared on more than 70 albums, including compilations such as ''[[Mas Flow 2]]'' and ''[[Blin Blin Vol. 1]]''.

==Musical career==
===Early career===
Ayala was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and was influenced by several musicians in his family, including his father and some of his mother's relatives.<ref name="amg">{{cite web| last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:axfuxql0ldse~T1| title=Daddy Yankee Biography|  publisher=[[All Music Guide]]| accessdate=2008-01-18}}</ref> During his childhood he practiced singing and focused on lyrical improvisation. Although Ayala first aspired to join the ranks of baseball<U+2019>s Major Leagues, he abandoned this goal after being involved in an accident<U+2014>at age seventeen, he was caught in the crossfire of a [[barrio]] gun battle and received two bullet wounds. One bullet grazed his arm and the other, from an [[AK-47]], hit him in the leg and left him with a permanent limp.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1540229,00.html| title=Party on| publisher=The Guardian| date=[[2005-08-01]]| accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref> Following this incident he became interested in the underground rap movement, which at the time was in an early organizational stage.<ref name="Cultura">{{cite web| url=http://www.prpop.org/biografias/d_bios/DaddyYankee.shtml|  title=Biografias:Daddy Yankee| author=Miguel L<U+00F3>pez Ortiz | publisher=Fundaci<U+00F3>n Nacional para la Cultura Popular |  accessdate=2008-01-05}}</ref> He also took more interest in the events that took place in the neighborhood in which he was raised, a public housing project named Villa Kennedy.<ref name="amg"/> Early in his career he attempted to imitate the style of [[Vico C]]. He went on to emulate other artists in the genre, including [[DJ Playero]], DJ Nelson, and DJ Goldy, taking elements from their styles in order to develop an original style.<ref name="Cultura"/> In doing so, he eventually abandoned the traditional model of rap and become one of the first artists to perform reggaeton.<ref name="Cultura"/> Ayala first recorded with DJ Playero as a featured artist in a production titled ''[[Playero 37]]'', which was released in 1992.<ref name="amg"/>

===Independent productions===
His first album, titled ''[[No Mercy (Daddy Yankee album)|No Mercy]]'', was produced in 1995 when Ayala was eighteen years old.<ref name="amg"/> The production did not sell well, and he continued his work within the genre for the rest of the decade, eventually forming a duo with [[Nicky Jam]]. One of the duo's songs, "Posici<U+00F3>n", was included in the soundtrack of ''One Tough Cop'', a movie directed by [[Bruno Barreto]], that was released in 1998. Beginning in 2000, Ayala began concentrating more on his solo career, releasing albums produced outside studios. The first production he released was titled ''El Cartel'', featuring elements of the [[mixtape]] style.<ref name="amg"/> In 2001 ''El Cartel II'' was released, a direct sequel to the previous production, and influenced by similar genres.

In 2002 ''[[El Cangri.com]]'' was released, and became the first album in Ayala's career to sell well outside Puerto Rico, mostly in the United States.<ref name="amg"/> The album was produced by VI Music, an independent recording studio in Puerto Rico, and was not supported by a major label.<ref name="amg"/> The most successful single from the album was "Latigazo", which received significant play on radio stations in [[New York]] and [[Miami]].<ref name="amg"/> The album reached the #43 on Billboard's Top Latin Albums chart. <ref name="amg"/> Following the release of this disc, Ayala performed at the [[Roberto Clemente Coliseum]] before 12,000 fans.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.terra.com/ocio/articulo/html/oci152057,2.htm| title=Daddy Yankee, Reggaet<U+00F3>n desde Puerto Rico| publisher=Terra| accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref> The following year VI Music produced ''Los Homerun-es''.<ref name="amg"/> The album became the leader in sales in Puerto Rico, during a year in which several other reggaeton artists released significant productions, including Luny Tune's ''Mas Flow'', Don Omar's ''The Last Don'', and Tego Calderon's ''El Abayarde''.<ref name="amg"/> The album's success helped Ayala receive the publicity required for a crossover to the United States market, and marked the last album he released with VI music before signing a contract with [[Universal Records|Universal]].<ref name="amg"/>

===2004<U+2014>2005===
Ayala's next album, ''[[Barrio Fino]]'', was released in July 2004 by [[El Cartel Records]]. It was the most highly anticipated album in the reggaeton community.<ref name="MTV"> {{cite web| url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/yankee_daddy/artist.jhtml?timeline=false#bio| title=Daady Yankee| publisher=MTV| accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref> Ayala had enjoyed [[salsa (music)|salsa music]] since he was young, and this led him to include music of genres besides reggaeton in the album.<ref name="MTV"/> The most prominent of these cross-genre singles was "Melao", in which he performed with [[Andy Monta<U+00F1>ez]].<ref name="MTV"/> The album was described as his most complete, and with it he intended to introduce combinations of reggaeton and other genres to the English-speaking market.<ref name="MTV"/> ''Barrio Fino'' was followed up by an international tour with performances in numerous countries including the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], [[Panama]], [[Honduras]], [[Spain]], [[Colombia]], [[Argentina]], [[Venezuela]], and the United States.<ref name="MTV"/> The album has sold over 500,000 copies in the United States alone and has sold well throughout [[Latin America]] and worldwide.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.latin-artists.com/news.php?id=559&is=1| title=Daddy Yankee Receives Five Gold And Platinum Albums| publisher=latin-artists.com| date=[[2005-03-13]]| accessdate=2008-02-18}}</ref> 

In 2005 Ayala was one of the most recognized reggaeton artists within the music industry, a year where he won several international awards.<ref name="Univision">{{cite web| url=http://www.univision.com/uv/music/1541678/Daddy_Yankee/biografia;jsessionid=5EXMBJUDKMDFACWIAAOCFEYKZAAB0IWC| title=Daddy Yankee: Biograf<U+00ED>a| publisher=Univision| accessdate=2008-01-07}}</ref> The first award of the year was a [[Premio Lo Nuestro]] within the "Latin music" category, which he received for ''Barrio Fino''.<ref name="Univision"/> In this event he performed "[[Gasolina]]" in a performance that was described as "innovative".<ref name="Univision"/> ''Barrio Fino'' also won the "Reggaeton Album of the Year" award in the Latin Billboard that took place on [[April 28]], [[2005]],<ref name="Univision"/> where he performed a mix of three of his songs in a duo with [[P. Diddy]]. The album was promoted throughout [[Latin America]], the [[United States]], and [[Europe]], reaching certified gold in [[Japan]]. Due to the album's success, Ayala received promotional contracts with radio stations and soda companies, including [[Pepsi]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/yankee_daddy/bio.jhtml| title=Daddy Yankee| publisher=CMT.com| accessdate=2008-02-18}}</ref> His single "Gasolina" received the majority of votes cast for the second edition of ''Premios Juventud'', in which it received eight nominations and won seven awards.<ref name="Univision"/> Ayala also made a live presentation during the award ceremony. "Gasolina" received nominations in the Latin Grammy and MTV Video Music Awards.<ref name="Univision"/> 

The successful single, "Gasolina", was covered by artists from different music genres. This led to a controversy when Los Lagos, a Mexican [[banda music|banda]] group did a cover with the original beat but changed the song's lyrics.<ref name="Los Lagos">{{cite web| url= http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?cid=606337| title=Gasolina grupera | author=Nathalia Morales| publisher=Univision| accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref> Ayala's lawyer, Edwin Prado, said that the artist feels that to have his songs covered is an "honor, but it must be done the right way."<ref name="Los Lagos"/> Prior to releasing the banda version of the song, the group's label solicited the copyright permission to perform the single and translate it to a different music style, but did not receive permission to change the lyrics, and legal actions ensued.<ref name="Los Lagos"/>

===2006<U+2014>Present===
On [[April 30]], [[2006]], Ayala was named one of the 100 most influential people by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine.<ref name="TIME">{{cite web| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1187400,00.html| title=Daddy Yankee <nowiki>|</nowiki> TIME| author=Carolina Miranda| publisher=''Time''| date=[[2006-04-30]]| accessdate=2007-05-12}}</ref> The publication cited Ayala's economic success and ability to merchandise his product as reasons for his influence in the music industry.<ref name="TIME"/> During this period, Ayala and William Omar Landr<U+00F3>n (more commonly known by his artistic name [[Don Omar]]) were involved in a rivalry within the genre, dubbed "tiraera".  The rivalry received significant press coverage despite being denied early on by both artists.  It originated with a lyrical conflict between the artists begun by Ayala's comments in a remix single, where he criticized Landron's common usage of the nickname "King of Kings".<ref name="King of kings">{{cite web| url=http://www.malianteo.com/article1163.html| title=Don Omar se va "calle" en tiraera a Daddy Yankee| publisher=Maleanteo.com| accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref> Don Omar responded to this in a song titled "Ahora Son Major", part of his album ''Los Rompediscotecas''.<ref name="King of kings"/>

''El Cartel: The Big Boss'' was released by [[Interscope]] on [[June 5]], [[2007]]. Ayala stated that the album marked a return to his hip-hop roots as opposed to being considered a strictly reggaeton album.<ref name="YANKEE">{{cite web| url=http://www.latinrapper.com/daddy_yankee_interview.html| title=The Boss is Back: Daddy Yankee Returns to his Roots| publisher=LatinRapper.com| date=[[2007-05-22]]| accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref> The album was produced in 2006, and included the  participation of [[will.i.am]], [[Scott Storch]], Tainy Tunes, Neli, and personnel from Ayala's label.
