The '''Ikarus S-49''' was one of the first fighter aircraft produced in [[Yugoslavia]] after [[World War II]] by the [[Ikarbus|Ikarus Aircraft factory]]. It was a conventional, low-wing cantilever monoplane with retractable tailwheel undercarriage and bore a strong resemblance to the [[Yakovlev Yak-9]], although it was in fact a fresh design.

==Development==
After the Resolution of [[Informbiro]] in 1948 and breakup with [[Soviet Union]], Yugoslavia was forced to rely on its domestic military industry. The same constructors that built the [[Rogozarski IK-3]] before the war, engineers [[Kosta Sivcev]], [[Slobodan Zrnic]] and [[Svetozar Popovic]], used existing technical documentation of IK-3 to construct a new fighter aircraft, the  Ikarus S-49. The first prototype of the S-49A flew in the June 1949. The first operational aircraft were delivered to combat units at the beginning of 1950.

The S-49A was of mixed construction, with Soviet built [[Klimov M-105|VK-105]] engines which were no longer available after 1948. Therefore, it was decided to produce a new version of aircraft powered by the similar French [[Hispano-Suiza 12Z]]-17 engine. Because of the bigger and heavier engine, the new aircraft had to be of all metal construction with a much longer nose. While the aircraft was mainly built by Ikarus, the wings and tail were built by the [[SOKO]] factory in [[Mostar]].<ref name="complete fighters">{{cite book |last= Green|first= W |coauthors=Swanborough, G |title= The Complete Book of Fighters |edition= |year= 1994|publisher= Smithmark |isbn= 0-8317-3939-8}}</ref>  The armament remained the same as with Ikarus S-49A and it consisted of one 20&nbsp;mm MG-151 German cannon and two 12.7&nbsp;mm Colt Browning machineguns. In addition, under wing racks for two 50&nbsp;kg bombs or four 127&nbsp;mm [[HVAR]] missiles were added. 

At the beginning of 1952, the new fighter aircraft Ikarus S-49C was introduced into the units of [[SFR Yugoslav Air Force|Yugoslav Air Force]]. About 130 S-49C were produced during the 1950s and they remained in service until 1961.<ref name="complete fighters"/>

* '''S-49A''' - mixed construction and [[Klimov M-105]] engine (45 built)
