The '''Chopin Statue''' is a large bronze statue of [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin]] that now stands in the upper part of [[Warsaw]]'s [[Royal Baths Park| Royal Baths Park aka <U+0141>azienki Park]], adjacent to ''Aleje Ujazdowskie'' ([[Ujazd<U+00F3>w Avenue]]). 

It was designed in 1907 by [[Wac<U+0142>aw Szymanowski]] for its planned erection on the centenary of Chopin's birth in 1910, but its execution was delayed by controversy about the design, then by the outbreak of [[World War I]]. The statue was finally cast and erected in 1926.<ref name="PWN-372"> Encyklopedia powszechna PWN (1976), vol. 4, p. 372.</ref>

During [[World War II]], the statue was destroyed by the [[Occupation of Poland (1939<U+2013>1945)|occupying Germans]] on May 31, 1940.<ref>[http://www.sztuka.net.pl/palio/html.run?_Instance=www.sztuka.net.pl&_PageID=445&newsId=283&callingPageId=487&_CheckSum=754040178 Warszawa - Pomnik Fryderyka Chopina w <U+0141>azienkach Kr<U+00F3>lewskich]</ref><ref>[http://kalendarium.polska.pl/wydarzenia/article.htm?id=274038 Wysadzenie pomnika Chopina w Warszawie przez hitlerowc<U+00F3>w]</ref> According to local legend, the next day a handwritten sign was found at the site which read: "I don<U+2019>t know who destroyed me, but I know why: so that I won<U+2019>t play the funeral march for your leader." 

The original mould for the statue, which had survived the war, made it possible to cast a replica, which was placed at the original site in 1958.<ref name="PWN-372" /> At the statue's base, since 1959, on summer Sunday afternoons are performed free piano recitals of Chopin's compositions. 

The stylized [[willow]] over Chopin's seated figure echoes a pianist's hand and fingers.

A 1:1-scale replica of Szymanowski's statue stands in [[Hamamatsu]], [[Japan]]. There are also preliminary plans to erect another replica along [[Chicago]]'s lakefront, in addition to a different sculpture commemorating the artist in [[Chopin Park (Chicago)|Chopin Park]], for the 200th anniversary of Chopin's birth (2010).<ref>[http://www.chopinmonumentinchicago.com/ Chopin Monument in Chicago]</ref>

Szymanowski's statue was the world's tallest Chopin monument until the unveiling, on March 3, 2007, of the slightly taller, modernistic bronze in [[Shanghai]], [[China]].
