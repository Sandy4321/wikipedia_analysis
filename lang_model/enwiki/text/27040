'''Jayne Mansfield''' (born '''Vera Jayne Palmer'''; [[April 19]], [[1933]]&mdash;[[29 June]] [[1967]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[actor|actress]] and ''[[Playboy]]'' [[centerfold]]. 

One of the leading sex symbols of the 1950s,  like [[Marilyn Monroe]], Mansfield starred in several popular Hollywood films that emphasized her platinum-blonde hair, dramatic hourglass figure, and cleavage-revealing costumes.  She was a recipient of a [[Golden Globe Award]] and a [[Theatre World Award]] for two early screen and stage performances. 

Though Mansfield appeared in several popular Hollywood films, her status in the industry proved fleeting, and she was quickly relegated to low-budget melodramas and comedies. Negative publicity and poor business decisions eventually forced her into regional nightclub appearances before her death in an automobile accident at the age of 34.

==Early life==
Jayne Mansfield, of German and English ancestry, was the only child of Herbert William and Vera (nee Jeffrey) Palmer.<ref> [http://worldconnect.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=gheller&id=I1057 Heller & More: PA, NJ, New England, Cornwall, NW Europe.] ''worldconnect.rootsweb.com'' (4 January 2004).  Retrieved on [[2006-12-13]].</ref> She was born in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania|Bryn Mawr]], [[Pennsylvania]] but spent her early childhood in [[Phillipsburg]], [[New Jersey]]. When she was three years old her father, a lawyer who was in practice with future [[New Jersey]] governor [[Robert B. Meyner]], died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while driving in a [[car]] with his wife and daughter. After his death her mother worked as a school teacher and in [[1939]], when Vera Palmer remarried, the family moved to [[Dallas, Texas]]. Jayne's desire to become an actress developed at an early age. After high school she studied [[drama]] and [[physics]] at [[Southern Methodist University|Southern Methodist University]]. 

In 1950, at age 16, Jayne married [[Paul Mansfield]].  Her acting aspirations were temporarily put on hold with the birth of her first [[child]], Jayne Marie Mansfield, on November 8, 1950. She juggled motherhood and classes at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], then spent a year at [[Camp Gordon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] during her husband's service in the [[Army|United States Army]].  She attended UCLA during the summer of 1953 then went back to Texas for fall quarter at Southern Methodist University. In [[Dallas]] she became a student of actor [[Baruch Lumet]], father of director [[Sidney Lumet]] and  founder of the [[Dallas]] Institute of the Performing Arts. On [[October 22]], [[1953]], she first appeared on stage in a production of [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[Death of a Salesman]]''.

Jayne won several [[beauty contest]]s while living in Texas; these included Miss Photoflash, Miss Magnesium Lamp and Miss Fire Prevention. The one title she turned down was Miss [[Roquefort|Roquefort Cheese]] because she said it "just didn't sound right."{{Fact|date=January 2007}}

==Acting career and celebrity==
Jayne's husband at the time, Paul Mansfield, hoped the birth of their child would discourage her interest in acting. When it did not he agreed to move to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in late 1954 to help further her career.<ref>[http://www.jaynemansfield.com/biography.html Official Jayne Mansfield website], sanctioned by CMG Worldwide, official representatives of Jayne Mansfield estate. Retrieved [[2006-12-31]].</ref>  Between a variety of odd jobs, including candy vendor at a movie theatre, Jayne studied drama at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Her [[film|movie]] [[career]] began with bit parts at [[Warner Brothers]]. She had been signed by the studio after one of its talent scouts discovered her in a production at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]]. Mansfield had small roles in ''[[Female Jungle]]'' ([[1954 in film|1954]]), and in ''[[Pete Kelly's Blues (movie)|Pete Kelly's Blues]]'' (1955) which starred [[Jack Webb]]. 

In 1955 [[Paul Wendkos]] offered her the dramatic role of Gladden in ''[[The Burglar]]'', his film adaptation of [[David Goodis]]' novel. The film was done in [[film noir]] style, and Mansfield appeared alongside [[Dan Duryea]] and [[Martha Vickers]]. ''The Burglar'' was released two years later when Mansfield's fame was at its peak. She was successful in this straight dramatic role, though most of her subsequent film appearances would be either comedic in nature or capitalize on her sex appeal{{Fact|date=January 2007}}. She made two more movies with [[Warner Bros.]], one of which gave her a minor role as Angel O'Hara, a hitman's mistress, opposite [[Edward G. Robinson]] in ''[[Illegal]]'' (1955). 

===Career high===
In 1955, she went to [[New York City|New York]] and appeared in a prominent role in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of [[George Axelrod]]'s [[comedy]] ''[[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (play)|Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?]]''. The New York Times described the "commendable abandon" of her scantily clad rendition of Rita Marlowe in the play, "a platinum-pated movie siren with the wavy contours of [[Marilyn Monroe]].<ref>Atkinson, Brooks. "Theatre: Axelrod's Second Comedy," ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 October 1955, p. 22</ref> 

Mansfield then returned to Hollywood and starred in [[Frank Tashlin]]'s film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'' ([[1956 in film|1956]]). On [[May 3]], [[1956]], she signed a long-term [[contract]] with [[20th-Century Fox]]. She then played a straight dramatic role (albeit as a stripper) in ''[[The Wayward Bus]]'' in 1957. With her role in this film she attempted to move away from her "dumb blonde" image and establish herself as a serious actress. This film was adapted from [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel. The cast included [[Dan Dailey]] and [[Joan Collins]]. The role was a change of pace from Mansfield's stereotyped persona and the film enjoyed reasonable success at the box office. 

She won a [[Golden Globe]] in [[1957]] for ''Most Promising Newcomer - Female'', beating [[Carroll Baker]] and [[Natalie Wood]], for her performance as a "wistful derelict" in ''The Wayward Bus''. It was "generally conceded to have been her best acting," according to [[The New York Times]], in a fitful career hampered by her flamboyant image, squeaky voice ("a soft-voiced coo punctuated with squeals"),<ref>"Jayne Mansfield Dies in New Orleans Car Crash," ''[[The New York Times]], [[30 June]] [[1967]], p. 33</ref> almost comically voluptuous figure, and limited acting range.

She then reprised her role of Rita Marlowe in the [[1957 in film|1957]] movie version of ''[[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?]]'', co-starring [[Tony Randall]] and [[Joan Blondell]]. ''The Girl Can't Help It'' and ''Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?'' were popular successes in their day and are largely considered classics. Her fourth starring role in a Hollywood film was ''Kiss Them for Me'' (1957) in which she received prominent billing alongside [[Cary Grant]]. However, in the film itself she is little more than comedy relief while Grant's character shows a preference for a sleek, demure redhead portrayed by fashion model [[Suzy Parker]]. ''Kiss Them for Me'' was a box-office disappointment and would prove to be her final starring role in a mainstream Hollywood studio film.

===Career decline===
Despite her monumental publicity and public popularity, good roles dried up for Mansfield after 1959, the year after she married [[Mickey Hargitay]], a Hungarian-born [[bodybuilder]] who had been [[Mr. Universe]] 1955. The actress nevertheless kept busy in a series of low-budget films mostly filmed in Europe. These showed off as much of her anatomy as possible, but used little of her acting or comedic talents. Mansfield remained a highly visible personality even with these career setbacks.

Fox tried to cast Mansfield opposite [[Paul Newman]] in his ill-fated first attempt at comedy, ''Rally Round The Flag, Boys'', but the actor preferred her ''Wayward Bus'' co-star [[Joan Collins]].{{Fact|date=January 2007}} Among other unrealized projects, [[Joe Pasternak]] was to produce ''Three Blondes'', a film based on a French novel by Pierre Dassete that (hopefully) would have co-starred Mansfield, [[Lana Turner]] and [[Kim Novak]]. However, the project was dropped before production began{{Fact|date=January 2007}}.

In 1960 Fox loaned her out to appear in two independent gangster thrillers in England. These were ''[[Too Hot to Handle (1960 film)|Too Hot to Handle]]'', which was directed by [[Terence Young]] and co-starred [[Karlheinz B<U+00F6>hm]], and ''The Challenge'', co-starring [[Anthony Quayle]]. Fox also lined up ''[[It Happened in Athens]]''. This Olympic-themed movie was filmed in Greece and would not be released until 1962. Despite receiving top billing in ''It Happened in Athens'', Mansfield was relegated to a colorful, scantily-clad supporting role.

===''Promises! Promises!''===
[[Image:Vbt30j.jpg|thumb|right|Mansfield and [[Tommy Noonan]] in the most repeated nude scene of the movie ''Promises! Promises!'']]
In 1963, the comedian turned producer-screenwriter [[Tommy Noonan]] persuaded Mansfield to become the first mainstream American actress to appear in the nude with a starring role in the film ''[[Promises! Promises!]]''. Photographs of a naked Mansfield on the set were published in ''[[Playboy]].'' In one notorious set of images Mansfield stares at one of her breasts, as does her male secretary and a hair stylist, then grasps it in one hand and lifts it high. The sold-out issue resulted in an obscenity charge for [[Hugh Hefner]] which was later dropped. (In Kenneth Anger's book ''[[Hollywood Babylon|Hollywood Babylon II]]'', a photo from an unknown source reveals a shot from the movie's set in which Mansfield displays prominent pubic hair.) ''[[Promises! Promises!]]'' was banned in Cleveland, but it enjoyed box-office success elsewhere.  Because of the film's success, Jayne landed on the Top 10 list of Box Office Attractions for that year. <ref> ''Jayne Mansfield: A Bio-bibliography by Jocelyn Faris'', p. 10</ref>

===Career end===
By the early [[1960s]] Mansfield's reign in Hollywood was effectively over. One critic summed up her last decade of film vehicles as "one of the most consistently awful in cinema history." The decision to do nude scenes had ruined any chance of her return to mainstream productions. Even Mansfield seemed stunned by her sudden shift in professional status, saying, "Once you were a starlet. Then you're a star. Can you be a starlet again?" 

In 1963 she appeared in the low-budget [[West Germany|West German]] movie ''Homesick for St. Pauli'' with Austrian-born [[schlager]] singer [[Freddy Quinn]]. Mansfield played Evelyne, a sexy American singer who traveling to [[Hamburg]] by ship. She is followed by an [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]-like American pop star played by Quinn. Mansfield sang two German songs in the movie, though her speaking voice was dubbed.

==Outside film==
===Stage work===
{{Expand|date=January 2007}}
'''Theater''': Mansfield acted on stage as well as in film. Aside from her career-making run in ''Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?'' she also appeared in stage productions of ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (musical)#The second production|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'' and ''[[Bus Stop (play)|Bus Stop]]'', which were well reviewed and co-starred Mickey Hargitay.

'''Tour''': In October [[1957]], Jayne Mansfield went on a 16-country tour of [[Europe]] for [[20th-Century Fox]]. She received much attention at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and was presented to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on [[November 4]], after a screening of the movie ''[[Les Girls]]''. "You are looking so beautiful," she said to the Queen, who replied, "Thank you very much indeed. So are you."<ref>"Jayne Mansfield Meets Queen", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 5 November 1957, p. 39</ref>

'''Stage show''': Dissatisfied with her film roles, Mansfield and Hargitay headlined at the Dunes in [[Las Vegas]] in an act called ''The House of Love'', for which the actress earned $35,000 a week. It proved to be such a hit that she extended her stay, and 20th-Century Fox Records subsequently recorded the show for an album called ''Jayne Mansfield Busts Up Las Vegas'', in 1962.

'''Nightclubs''': In [[1967]], the year she died, Mansfield's time was split between nightclub performances and the production of her last film, ''Single Room Furnished'', a low-budget production directed by Cimber. Work on the movie was suspended when the Cimbers' marriage collapsed in the wake of the actress's alcohol abuse, open infidelities, and her claim to Cimber that she had only ever been happy with her former lover, Nelson Sardelli. Mansfield continued her nightclub appearances in the U.S., South America, England, and Asia and became romantically involved with her married divorce lawyer, [[Sam Brody]].

===Television===
{{Expand|date=January 2007}}
Though her roles were becoming increasingly marginalized, Mansfield turned down the plum role of Ginger Grant in the television [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', claiming that the role, which eventually was given to [[Tina Louise]], was beneath her because "I am a movie star." 

Mansfield toured with [[Bob Hope]] for the [[United Service Organizations|USO]] and appeared on numerous television programs, including  ''[[The Jack Benny Show]]'' (where she played the violin), ''[[Steve Allen (comedian)|The Steve Allen Show]]'', ''Down You Go'', ''[[The Match Game]]'' (One rare episode exists with her as a team captain), and ''The [[Jackie Gleason]] Show''. Mansfield's television roles included appearances in ''[[Burke's Law]]'' and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. On returning from New York to Hollywood, she made several television appearances, including several spots as a featured guest star on [[game show]]s.

===Recordings===
{{Expand|date=January 2007}}
[[Image:ShakChaikMe.jpg|thumb|right|Album cover of ''Shakespeare, Tchaikovsky & Me'', 1964]]
In addition to singing in English and German in a number of films, in 1964, Mansfield released a novelty album called ''Jayne Mansfield: Shakespeare, Tchaikovsky & Me'', on which she recited [[Shakespeare]]'s sonnets and poems by [[Marlowe]], [[Browning]], [[Wordsworth]], and others against a background of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s music. The album cover depicted a bouffant-coiffed Mansfield with lips pursed and breasts barely covered by a fur stole, posing between busts of the Russian composer and the Bard of Avon.<ref>[http://www.triad.rr.com/dance/content/jayne.html Welcome to Raymondo's Dance-o-rama.] ''triad.rr.com'' Retrieved on [[2006-12-13]].</ref>

The New York Times described the album as the actress reading "30-odd poems in a husky, urban, baby voice". The paper's reviewer went on to state that "Miss Mansfield is a lady with apparent charms, but reading poetry is not one of them."<ref>Lask, Thomas, "Poetry: Revised Editions", The New York Times, 30 August 1964, page X21</ref>

==Publicity stunts==
{{cquote|Jayne Mansfield is making a career of being a girl.|20px|20px|Walter Winchell, reporter<ref>Strait, p. ??</ref>}} 
By the late 1950s, Mansfield began to generate a great deal of negative publicity due to her repeatedly successful attempts to expose her breasts in carefully staged public "accidents" that today would be euphemistically called "[[wardrobe malfunction]]s". Her bosom was so much a part of her public persona that talk-show host [[Jack Paar]] once welcomed the actress to ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' by saying, "Here they are, Jayne Mansfield" (the line was written for Paar by [[Dick Cavett]]).<ref>"Country Boy", [[Time (magazine)|Time]], [[28 January]] [[1966]]</ref> Early in her career, the prominence of her breasts was considered problematic, leading her to be cut from her first professional assignment, an advertising campaign for [[General Electric]], which depicted several young women in bathing suits relaxing around a pool<ref>Strait, p. 116</ref>.

Mansfield appeared in about 2,500 newspaper photographs between September [[1956]] and May [[1957]], and had about 122,000 lines of newspaper copy written about her during this time. Because of the successful media blitz, Jayne Mansfield was a household name even though few people had seen her perform{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

===Wardrobe malfunctions===
[[Image:Sophia and jayne.jpg|thumb|left|Jayne Mansfield and Sophia Loren at Romanoff's in Beverly Hills]]
In April 1957, her bosom was the feature of a notorious publicity stunt intended to deflect attention from [[Sophia Loren]] during a dinner party in the Italian star's honor. Photographs of the encounter were published around the world. The most famous image showed Loren raising a contemptuous eyebrow at the American actress, who was standing between Loren and her dinner companion, [[Clifton Webb]], leaned over the table and allowed her breasts to spill over her low neckline and expose one nipple.

A similar incident, resulting in the full exposure of both breasts, occurred during a film festival in [[Berlin]], when Mansfield was wearing a low-cut dress and her second husband, Mickey Hargitay, picked her up so she could bite a bunch of grapes hanging overhead at a party; the movement caused her breasts to erupt out of the dress. The photograph of that episode was a [[UPI]] sensation, appearing in newspapers and magazines with the word "censored" hiding the actress's exposed bosom.

The world media was quick to condemn Mansfield's stunts, and one editorial columnist wrote, "We are amused when Miss Mansfield strains to pull in her stomach to fill out her bikini better. But we get angry when career-seeking women, shady ladies, and certain starlets and actresses ... use every opportunity to display their anatomy unasked."<ref>Strait, p. 116</ref>

===Debated measurements===
Mansfield's most celebrated physical attributes would alternate in size due to her pregnancies and breast-feeding five children, and indeed many photos show the actress's bosom appearing smaller than its reputed 40D measurement. During a nightclub tour in [[London]], [[England]] in 1967, her breasts were measured by paparazzi, and they were reported to be 46D.{{Fact|date=January 2007}} The director and producer [[Russ Meyer]] said that Mansfield's reputation for being large-breasted was based on a misconception and due mainly to her visibly large ribcage and the adoption of daring decolletages.

==Comparison to Marilyn Monroe==
[[Image:Jaynemansfield5.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Publicity still  - 20th Century fox]]
{{cquote|I don't know why you people [the press] like to compare me to [[Marilyn Monroe|Marilyn]] or that girl, what's her name, [[Kim Novak]]. Cleavage, of course, helped me a lot to get where I am. I don't know how they got there.|20px|20px|Jayne Mansfield<ref>Strait, p. ??</ref>}}

Another impediment to retaining her position as America's bombshell, especially after the death of [[Marilyn Monroe]], was the fact that, according to The New York Times, Mansfield "suffers from too much publicity and too few roles. She has become rather a caricature &mdash; like [[Mae West]] &mdash; and alienates the segment [of movie-goers] which takes sex seriously."<ref>Glenn, Larry. "Hollywood Lacks a New 'Goddess'", ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[14 December]] [[1962]], p. 5</ref>

By 1962, if the studios held her in low regard as an actress, Mansfield still commanded high prices as a live performer, though she openly yearned to establish a more sophisticated image. She announced that she wanted to study acting in New York, in apparent emulation of Marilyn Monroe's stint with the [[Actors' Studio]]. But her reliance on the racy publicity that had set her path to fame would also prove to be her downfall. Fox didn't renew its contract with her in 1962.

Even with her film roles drying up she was widely considered to be Monroe's primary rival in a crowded field of contenders that included [[Mamie Van Doren]] (whom Mansfield considered her professional nemesis), [[Diana Dors]], [[Cleo Moore]], [[Joi Lansing]], and [[Sheree North]].

Mansfield was married three times, divorced twice, and had five children. The actress reportedly also had affairs and [[sexual encounter]]s with numerous individuals, including [[Claude Terrail]] (the owner of the Paris restaurant [[La Tour d'Argent]]), the Brazilian playboy billionaire [[Jorge Guinle]],<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/21/1064082864024.html He loved them all.] ''theage.com.au'' ([[September 22]], [[2003]]).  Retrieved on [[2006-12-13]].</ref> and [[Robert F. Kennedy]].<ref>Strait, pp. 177-190, 153 - 157</ref> Her rival Monroe had relations with Guinle and Robert's brother [[John F. Kennedy]]. She was accompanied, in her death, by her lawyer and boyfriend at the time, [[Sam Brody]].

She had a brief affair with [[Jan Cremer]], a young Dutch writer who dedicated his autobiographical novel ''I, Jan Cremer'' (1965) to the actress calling the book "a wild and sexy masterpiece".<ref>"Books of the Times", ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[1 November]] [[1965]], p. 39</ref> She also had a well-publicized relationship in 1963 with the singer [[Nelson Sardelli]], whom she said she planned to marry once her divorce from Mickey Hargitay was finalized.<ref>Strait, pp. 167-168, 170, 173-174, 195, 197, 202,  203, 207, 208, and 224-225</ref> 

===Husbands/children===
*'''Paul Mansfield''', whom Jayne secretly married on 28 January 1950. The couple had a public wedding on 10 May 1950 and were divorced on 8 January 1958. During this marriage they had one child, [[Jayne Marie Mansfield]] (8 November 1950&mdash;), who was a [[Playboy]] centerfold in the magazine's [[July]] [[1976]] issue. Two weeks before her mother's death, Jayne Marie, then 16, accused her mother's boyfriend, Sam Brody, of beating her mother.<ref>"Jayne Mansfield Dies in [[New Orleans]] Car Crash", ''[[The New York Times]]'',30 June 1967, p. 33</ref> The girl's statement to officers of the West Los Angeles police department the following morning implicated her mother in encouraging the [[abuse]], and days later, a juvenile-court judge awarded temporary custody of Jayne Marie to a [[great-uncle]], W.W. Pigue.<ref>Strait, pp. 288-289</ref>

*'''[[Mickey Hargitay|Mikl<U+00F3>s Hargitay]]''', an actor and bodybuilder who was [[Mr. Universe]] [[1955]]. He and Jayne married on 13 January 1958 in [[Portuguese Bend]], [[California]] and divorced in [[Juarez]], [[Mexico]] in May 1963. The Mexican divorce was initially declared invalid in California but in August of 1964 Mansfield successfully sued to have it declared legal. She had previously filed for divorce on 4 May 1962 but told reporters "I'm sure we will make it up."<ref>"Miss Mansfield Asks Divorce", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 4 May 1962, p. 25</ref> Their acrimonious divorce had the actress accusing Hargitay of kidnapping one of her children to force a more favorable financial settlement.<ref>Strait, p. 224</ref> During this marriage she had three children&mdash; Mikl<U+00F3>s Jeffrey Palmer Hargitay (21 December 1958&mdash;), Zoltan Anthony Hargitay (1 August 1960&mdash;), and [[Mariska Hargitay|Mariska Magdolina Hargitay]] (called Maria, 24 January 1964&mdash;). Maria eventually became a 2005 Best Drama Actress [[Golden Globe]] award winner and a 2006 Outstanding Lead Drama Actress [[Emmy Award]]-winner; portrays [[Olivia Benson]] on the television show [[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]].

*'''[[Matt Cimber]]''' (''alias'' Matteo Ottaviano, n<U+00E9> Thomas Vitale Ottaviano):  an Italian-born film director. They married on 24 September 1964, separated on 11 July 1965, and filed for divorce on 20 July 1966. <ref>"Jayne Mansfield Asks Divorce", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 21 July 1966, p. 20</ref> Cimber was a director with whom the actress had become involved when he directed her in a widely praised stage production of ''[[Bus Stop (play)|Bus Stop]]'' in [[Yonkers, New York]], which costarred Hargitay. Cimber took over managing her career during their marriage. With him she had one son&mdash; Antonio Raphael Ottaviano (a.k.a. Tony Cimber, 17 October 1965&mdash;).

===The Pink Palace===
{{cquote|I've been identified with pink throughout my career, but I'm not as crazy about it as I've led people to believe. My favorite colors are actually neutrals - black and white - but then who thinks of a movie queen in black and white? Everything has to be in living color.|20px|20px|Jayne Mansfield<ref>Strait, p. ??</ref>}}

In November 1957, shortly before her marriage to Hargitay, Mansfield bought a 40-room [[Mediterranean]]-style mansion formerly owned by [[Rudy Vallee]] at 10100 [[Sunset Boulevard]] in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], which she had painted pink and then called the "Pink Palace." As its name implies, the mansion's interior and exterior color scheme was largely what would become the actress's signature color, with [[cupid]]s surrounded by pink [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lights]], pink furs in the bathrooms, a pink heart-shaped [[bathtub]], and a fountain spurting pink [[champagne (beverage)|champagne]]. Hargitay, who was a plumber and carpenter before he got into [[bodybuilding]], built its famous pink heart-shaped [[swimming pool]]. [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]] bought the Pink Palace in the [[1970s]]. In [[2002]], he sold it to developers, and the house was demolished in November of that year.

==Death==

[[Image:Grave_of_Jayne_Mansfield_2007.jpg|thumb|165px|left|Gravestone, picture taken in 2007]]After an engagement at the Gus Stevens Supper Club in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]], Mansfield, Brody, and their driver, Ronnie Harrison, along with the actress's children Mikl<U+00F3>s, Zoltan, and Mariska, set out in Stevens' [[Buick Electra|1966 Buick Electra 225]] to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], where Mansfield was to appear in an early morning television interview. On [[June 29]], at approximately 2:25 a.m., on [[U.S. Route 90|U.S. Highway 90]], the car, which was reportedly going 80 miles per hour, crashed into the rear of a [[semi-trailer truck|tractor-trailer]] that had slowed down because of a truck spraying [[insecticide|mosquito fogger]]. The children survived with minor injuries, but the adults were killed instantly.<ref>[http://www.walkerpub.com/radio_jaynemansfield.html THE NIGHT JAYNE MANSFIELD DIED, June 29, 1967.] ''walkerpub.com'' Retrieved on [[2006-12-13]].</ref> 

'''Rumors of decapitation:''' Rumors that Mansfield was [[decapitation|decapitated]] have been proven untrue, though she did suffer severe head trauma. This [[urban legend]] was possibly spawned by the appearance in police photographs of what resembles a blonde [[wig]] tangled in the car's smashed windshield. It is believed that this was either a wig that Mansfield was wearing at the time or was her actual hair and scalp.<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/movies/actors/jayne.htm Jayne Mansfield.] ''snopes.com'' (3 January 2001).  Retrieved on [[2006-12-13]].</ref> 

===Funeral===
The actress's funeral was held on [[July 3]], [[1967]], in [[Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania|Pen Argyl]]. The ceremony was officiated by a [[Methodism|Methodist]] minister, though Mansfield, who long tried to convert to [[Catholicism]], had become interested in [[Judaism]] at the end of her life, through her relationship with Sam Brody, though she apparently had not officially converted.<ref>Strait, p. 11</ref> She is interred in Fairview Cemetery, southeast of Pen Argyl.  Her gravestone is a beautiful carved heart which is pink, though it has faded over time.  It reads "WE LIVE TO LOVE YOU MORE EACH DAY".  

'''Estate:''' Shortly after her funeral, Mickey Hargitay sued his former wife's estate for more than $275,000 to support the children, whom he and his third and last wife, Ellen Siano, would raise. Mansfield's youngest child, Tony, was raised by his father, Matt Cimber, whose divorce from the actress was pending when she was killed. In [[1968]], wrongful-death lawsuits were filed on behalf of Jayne Marie Mansfield and Matt Cimber, the former for $4.8 million and the latter for $2.7 million.<ref>"Jayne Mansfield Suit Filed", ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[23 June]] [[1968]], p. 22</ref>
