The '''sixth season''' of the American television medical drama '''''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''''', commenced airing on the [[American Broadcasting Company]] on September 24, 2009, and concluded on May 20, 2010. The season was produced by [[ABC Studios]], in association with Shondaland Production Company and [[Mark Gordon|The Mark Gordon Company]]; the [[showrunner]] being [[Shonda Rhimes]]. Actors [[Ellen Pompeo]], [[Sandra Oh]], [[Katherine Heigl]], and [[Justin Chambers]] reprised their roles as surgical residents [[Meredith Grey]], [[Cristina Yang]], [[Izzie Stevens]], and [[Alex Karev]], respectively. Heigl was released from her contract in the middle of the season, while [[T.R. Knight]] did not appear as [[George O'Malley]], because Knight was released from his contract at the conclusion of [[Grey's Anatomy (season 5)|season five]]. Main cast members [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[Chandra Wilson]], [[James Pickens, Jr.]], [[Sara Ram<U+00ED>rez]], [[Eric Dane]], [[Chyler Leigh]], and [[Kevin McKidd]] also returned, while previous recurring star [[Jessica Capshaw]] was promoted to a series regular, and [[Kim Raver]] was given star billing after the commencement of the season.

The season follows the story of [[surgery|surgical]] [[Internship (medicine)|interns]], [[residency (medicine)|residents]] and their competent mentors, as they experience the difficulties of the competitive careers they have chosen. It is set in the surgical wing of the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, located in [[Seattle, Washington]]. A major storyline of the season is the characters adapting to change, as their beloved co-worker Stevens departed following the breakdown of her marriage, O'Malley died in the season premiere<U+2014>following his being dragged by a bus, and new [[cardiothoracic surgery|cardiothoracic surgeon]] [[Teddy Altman]] is given employment at the hospital. Further storylines include Shepherd being promoted to chief of surgery, Seattle Grace Hospital merging with the neighboring Mercy West<U+2014>introducing several new doctors, and several physicians lives being placed into danger<U+2014>when a grieving deceased patient's husband embarks on a shooting spree at the hospital, seeking revenge for his wife's death. 

The series ended its sixth season with 13.26 million viewers, ranking #17 in terms of ratings, the lowest the series had ever ranked up to then. The season received mixed critical feedback, with the season's early and late development given heavier critical acclaim, in contrast to the middle. The season was one of the least acclaimed in terms of awards and nominations, being the show's only season not to warrant a [[Primetime Emmy]] nomination. Despite the negative aspects of ratings and awards, the season managed to receive a spot on ''[[Movieline]]''{{'s}} top ten list. [[Buena Vista]] released the season onto a DVD box-set, being made available to regions 1, 2, and 4.

"I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked" saw the departure of Stevens, following the breakdown of her marriage with Karev.
