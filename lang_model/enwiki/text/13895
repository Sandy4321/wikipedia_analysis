}}'''Borobudur''' is a [[ninth century]] [[Mahayana Buddhist|Mahayana Buddhist]] monument in [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]]. The monument comprises six square platforms topped by three circular platforms, and is decorated with 2,672 [[relief]] panels and 504 [[Buddhist art|Buddha statues]].<ref name="p35-36">Soekmono (1976), page 35-36.</ref> A main dome is located at the center of the top platform, and is surrounded by seventy-two Buddha statues seated inside perforated [[stupa]].

The monument is both a [[shrine]] to the [[Lord Buddha]] and a place for Buddhist [[pilgrimage]]. The journey for pilgrims begins at the base of the monument and follows a path circumambulating the monument while ascending to the top through the three levels of [[Buddhist cosmology]], namely, ''[[Buddhist cosmology#K.C4.81madh.C4.81tu|Kamadhatu]]'' (the world of desire); ''[[Rupajhana|Rupadhatu]]'' (the world of forms); and ''[[Arupajhana|Arupadhatu]]'' (the world of formless). During the journey, the monument guides the pilgrims through a system of stairways and corridors with 1,460 narrative relief panels on the wall and the [[balustrade]]s.

Evidence suggests Borobudur was abandoned following the [[fourteenth century]] decline of Buddhist and [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hindu]] kingdoms in Java, and the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] conversion to [[Islam]].<ref name="Soekmono4">Soekmono (1976), page 4.</ref> It was rediscovered in [[1814]] by [[Sir Thomas Raffles]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] ruler of Java. Borobudur has since been preserved through several restorations. The largest restoration project was undertaken between 1975 and 1982 by the [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian government]] and [[UNESCO]], following which the monument was listed as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/592|accessdate=2006-12-05|title=Borobudur Temple Compounds|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|work=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}</ref> Borobudur is still used for pilgrimage, where once a year Buddhists in Indonesia celebrate [[Vesak]] at the monument, and Borobudur is Indonesia's single most visited [[tourism in Indonesia|tourist attraction]].<ref>{{cite book  | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Indonesia  | publisher =[[Lonely Planet|Lonely Planet Publications Pty Ltd]]  | date =November 2003  | location =Melbourne  | pages =p.211-215  | url =  | doi =  | id = ISBN 1-74059-154-2}}</ref><ref name="Hampton2004">{{cite journal| author=Mark P.

==Etymology==

In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], temples are known as ''candi'', thus "Borobudur Temple" is locally known as ''Candi Borobudur''. The term ''candi'' is also used more loosely to describe any ancient structure, for example, gates and bathing structures. The origins of the name ''Borobudur'' however are unclear,<ref name="Soekmono13">Soekmono (1976), page 13.</ref> although the original names of most ancient Indonesian temples are no longer known.<ref name="Soekmono13"/> The name 'Borobudur' was first written in the [[Sir Thomas Raffles]] book on Java history.<ref name="Raffles1814">{{cite book|title=The History of Java|author=Thomas Stamford Raffles|authorlink=Sir Thomas Raffles|date=1817|edition=1978|id=ISBN 0-19-580347-7|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> Raffles wrote about a monument called ''borobudur'', but there are no older documents suggesting the same name.<ref name="Soekmono13">Soekmono (1976), page 13.</ref> The only [[old Javanese]] manuscript that hints at the monument as a holy Buddhist sanctuary is [[Nagarakertagama]], written by [[Mpu Prapanca]] in [[1365]].<ref name="moens"/>

The name 'Bore-Budur', and thus 'BoroBudur', is thought to have been written by Raffles in [[English language|English]] grammar to mean the nearby village of Bore; most ''candi'' are named after a nearby village.  If it followed [[Javanese language]], the monument should have been named 'BudurBoro'. Raffles also suggested that 'Budur' might correspond to the modern Javanese word ''Buda'' ('ancient') - i.e., 'ancient Boro'.<ref name="Soekmono13"/> However, another archaeologist suggests the second component of the name ('Budur') comes from Javanese term ''bhudhara'' (or mountain).<ref name="casparis"/>

== Location ==
[[Image:Borobudur-Pawon-Mendut.png|thumb|right|300px|Location of Borobudur-Pawon-Mendut in one straight line.]]
Approximately {{km to mi|40}} northwest of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], Borobudur is located in an elevated area between two twin volcanoes, [[Mount Sundoro|Sundoro]]-[[Mount Sumbing|Sumbing]] and [[Mount Merbabu|Merbabu]]-[[Mount Merapi|Merapi]], and two rivers, the Progo and the Elo. According to local myth, the area known as [[Kedu Plain]] is a Javanese [[List of Sacred Places in Java|'sacred' place]] and has been dubbed 'the garden of Java' due to its high [[soil fertility|agricultural fertility]].<ref name="p1">Soekmono (1976), page 1.</ref> Besides Borobudur, there are other [[Buddhist temple|Buddhist]] and [[Hindu temple|Hindu]] temples in the area, including the [[Prambanan|Prambanan temples compound]]. During the restoration in the early 1900s, it was discovered that three Buddhist temples in the region, Borobudur, [[Pawon]] and [[Mendut]], are lined in one straight line position.<ref name="krom">{{cite book|author=N. J. Krom| title=Borobudur, Archaelogical Description| date=1927| publisher=Nijhoff| location=The Hague| url=http://www.borobudur.tv/mendut_borobudur.htm| accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref> It might be accidental, but the temples' alignment is in conjunction with a native [[Folklore|folk tale]] that a long time ago, there was a brick-paved road from Borobodur to Mendut with walls on both sides. The three temples (Borobodur&ndash;Pawon&ndash;Mendut) have similar architecture and ornamentation derived from the same time period, which suggests that ritual relationship between the three temples, in order to have formed a sacred unity, must have existed although exact ritual process is yet unknown.<ref name="moens">{{cite journal| title=Barabudur, Mendut en Pawon en hun onderlinge samenhang (''Barabudur, Mendut and Pawon and their mutual relationship'') |author=J.

Unlike other temples, which were built on a flat surface, Borobudur was built on a bedrock hill, {{m to ft|265|abbr=yes}} [[above sea level]] and {{m to ft|15|abbr=yes}} above the floor of the dried-out paleolake.<ref name="Murwanto">{{cite journal|author=Murwanto, H.; Gunnell, Y; Suharsono, S.; Sutikno, S. and Lavigne, F|title=Borobudur monument (Java, Indonesia) stood by a natural lake: chronostratigraphic evidence and historical implications|journal=The Holocene|volume14|issue=3|date=2004|pages=459&ndash;463|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683604hl721rr}}</ref> The lake's existence was the subject of intense discussion among archaeologists in the [[twentieth century]]; Borobudur was thought to have been built on a lake shore or even floated on a lake. In 1931, a Dutch artist and a scholar of Hindu and Buddhist architecture, W.O.J. Nieuwenkamp, developed a theory that Kedu Plain was once a lake and Borobudur initially represented a [[lotus flower]] floating on the lake.<ref name="casparis">J.G. de Casparis, "The Dual Nature of Barabudur", in G<U+00F3>mez and Woodward (1981), page 70 and 83.</ref> Lotus flowers are found in almost every Buddhist work of art, often serving as a throne for buddhas and base for stupas. The architecture of Borobudur itself suggests a lotus depiction, in which Buddha postures in Borobudur symbolize the [[Lotus Sutra]], mostly found in many [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] (a school of Buddhism widely spread in the [[east Asia]] region) texts. Three circular platforms on the top are also thought to represent a lotus leaf.<ref name="Murwanto"/> Nieuwenkamp's theory, however, was contested by many archaeologists because the natural environment surrounding the monument is a dry land.

Geologists, on the other hand, support Nieuwenkamp's view, pointing out [[clay]] sediments found near the site.<ref>R.W. van Bemmelen (1949). ''The geology of Indonesia, general geology of Indonesia and adjacent archipelago, vol 1A'', The Hague, Government Printing Office, Martinus Nijhoff. cited in Murwanto (2004).</ref> A study of [[stratigraphy]], sediment and [[pollen]] samples conducted in 2000 supports the existence of a paleolake environment near Borobudur,<ref name="Murwanto"/> which tends to confirm Nieuwenkamp's theory. The lake area fluctuated with time and the study also proves that Borobudur was near the lake shore circa [[thirteenth century|thirteenth]] and [[fourteenth century]]. River flows and [[Volcano|volcanic activities]] shape the surrounding landscape, including the lake. One of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia, Mount Merapi, is in the direct vicinity of Borobudur and has been very active since the [[Pleistocene]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Newhall C.G., Bronto S., Alloway B., Banks N.G., Bahar I., del Marmol M.A., Hadisantono R.D., Holcomb R.T., McGeehin J., Miksic J.N., Rubin M., Sayudi S.D., Sukhyar R., Andreastuti S., Tilling R.I., Torley R., Trimble D., and Wirakusumah A.D.| title= 10,000 Years of explosive eruptions of Merapi Volcano, Central Java: archaeological and modern implications| journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research| volume=100| issue=1| date=2000| pages=9&ndash;50| url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0377-0273(00)00132-3}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Construction ===
[[Image:Borobudur monks 1.jpg|thumb|right|Buddhist pilgrims meditate on the top platform.]]

There is no written record of who built Borobudur or of its intended purpose.<ref name="Soekmono9">Soekmono (1976), page 9.</ref> The construction time has been estimated by comparison between [[stone carving|carved]] reliefs on the temple's hidden foot and the [[inscription]]s commonly used in royal charters during the eight and ninth centuries.  Borobudur was likely founded around [[800 AD]].<ref name="Soekmono9"/> This corresponds to the period between 760&ndash;830&nbsp;AD, the peak of the [[Sailendra|Sailendra dynasty]] in central Java,<ref>Miksic (1990)</ref>, when it was under the influence of the [[Srivijaya|Srivijayan Empire]]. The construction has been estimated to have taken 75 years and been completed during the reign of [[Samaratungga]] in 825.<ref name="Dumarcay">Dumar<U+00E7>ay (1991).</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula| author=Paul Michel Munoz| publisher=Didier Millet| date=2007| id= ISBN 9814155675| pages=p.143| location=Singapore}}</ref>

There is confusion between [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] rulers in [[Java]] around that time. The Sailendras were known as ardent followers of Lord Buddha, though stone inscriptions found at Sojomerto suggest they may have been Hindus.<ref name="Dumarcay"/> It was during this time that many Hindu and Buddhist monuments were built on the plains and mountain around the Kedu Plain. The Buddhist monuments, including Borobudur, were erected around the same time as the Hindu [[Shiva]] [[Prambanan]] temple compound. In 732 AD, the Shivaite King [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]] commissioned a Hindu Shiva ''lingga'' sanctuary to be built on the Ukir hill, only 10&nbsp;km (6.2&nbsp;miles) east of Borobudur.<ref name="holing">{{cite journal |journal=Indonesia |title=In Search of "Ho-Ling" |author=W.

Construction of Buddhist temples, including Borobudur, at that time was possible because Sanjaya's immediate successor, [[Rakai Panangkaran]], granted his permission to the Buddhist followers to build such temples.<ref name="meulen">{{cite journal |journal=Indonesia |title=King Sa<U+00F1>jaya and His Successors |author=W.

=== Abandonment === 
[[Image:Borobudur stupas.jpg|right|thumb|Borobudur stupas overlooking a shadowy mountain of Java. For centuries, it has been deserted.]]
Borobudur lay hidden for centuries under layers of [[volcanic ash]] and jungle growth. The facts behind its abandonment remain a mystery. It is not known when active use of the monument and Buddhist pilgrimage to it ceased.  Somewhere between 928 and 1006, the center of power moved to [[East Java]] region and series of volcanic eruptions took place; it is not certain whether the latter influenced the former but several sources mention this as the most likely period of abandonment.<ref name="Soekmono4"/><ref name="Murwanto"/> Soekmono (1976) also mentions the popular belief that the temples were disbanded when the population converted to [[Islam]] in the [[15th century|fifteenth century]].<ref name="Soekmono4"/> 

The monument was not forgotten completely, though folk stories gradually shifted from its past glory into more [[superstitious]] beliefs associated with bad luck and misery. Two [[Javanese historical texts|old Javanese chronicles]] (''babad'') from the eighteenth century mention cases of bad luck associated with the monument. According to the ''Babad Tanah Jawi'' (or the History of Java), the monument was a fatal factor for a rebel who revolted against the king of [[Mataram]] in 1709.<ref name="Soekmono4">Soekmono (1976), page 4.</ref> The hill was besieged and the insurgents were defeated and sentenced to death by the king. In the ''Babad Mataram'' (or the History of the Mataram Kingdom), the monument was associated with the misfortune of the crown prince of the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]] in 1757.<ref name="p5">Soekmono (1976), page 5.</ref> In spite of a taboo against visiting the monument, "he took what is written as ''the knight who was captured in a cage'' (a statue in one of the perforated stupas)". Upon returning to his palace, he fell ill and died one day later.

=== Rediscovery ===
[[Image:Stupa Borobudur.jpg|right|thumb|Borobudur's main stupa, which is empty and has created a mystery during the discovery period.]]
Following the [[Anglo-Dutch Java War]], Java was under British administration from 1811 to 1816. The appointed governor was Lieutenant [[Governor-General]] [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]], who took great interest in the history of Java. He collected Javanese antiques and made notes through contacts with local inhabitants during his tour throughout the island. On an inspection tour to [[Semarang]] in 1814, he was informed about a big monument deep in a jungle near the village of Bumisegoro.<ref name="p5"/> He was not able to make the discovery himself and sent H.C. Cornelius, a Dutch engineer, to investigate.

In two months, Cornelius and his 200 men cut down trees, burned down vegetation and dug away the earth to reveal the monument. Due to the danger of collapse, he could not unearth all galleries. He reported his findings to Raffles including various drawings. Although the discovery is only mentioned by a few sentences, Raffles has been credited with the monument's recovery who had brought it to the world's attention.<ref name="Raffles1814"/> 

Hartmann, a Dutch administrator of the Kedu region, continued Cornelius' work and in 1835 the whole complex was finally unearthed. His interest in Borobudur was more personal than official. Hartmann did not write any reports of his activities; in particular, the alleged story that he discovered the large statue of Buddha in the main stupa.<ref name="p6">Soekmono (1976), page 6.</ref> In 1842, Hartmann investigated the main dome although what he discovered remains unknown as the main stupa remains empty.

[[Image:Borobudur photograph by van kinsbergen.jpg|right|thumb|The first photograph of Borobudur by [[Isidore van Kinsbergen]] (1873) after the monument was cleared up.]]
The [[Dutch East Indies]] government then commissioned F.C. Wilsen, a Dutch engineering official, who studied the monument and drew hundreds of relief sketches. J.F.G. Brumund was also appointed to make a detailed study of the monument, which was completed in 1859. The government intended to publish an article based on Brumund study supplemented by Wilsen's drawings, but Brumund refused to cooperate. The government then commissioned another scholar, C. Leemans, who compiled a [[monograph]] based on Brumund's and Wilsen's sources. In 1873, the first monograph of the detailed study of Borobudur was published, followed by its French translation a year later.<ref name="p6"/> The first photograph of the monument was taken in 1873 by a Dutch-[[Flemish people|Flemish]] engraver, [[Isidore van Kinsbergen]].<ref name="p42">Soekmono (1976), page 42.</ref>

Appreciation of the site developed slowly, and it served for some time largely as a source of souvenirs and income for "souvenir hunters" and thieves. In 1882, the chief inspector of cultural artifacts recommended that Borobudur be entirely disassembled with the relocation of reliefs into museums due to the unstable condition of the monument.<ref name="p42"/> As a result, the government appointed Groenveldt, an [[archeologist]], to undertake a thorough investigation of the site and to assess the actual condition of the complex; his report found that these fears were unjustified and recommended it be left intact.

===Contemporary events===
[[Image:Borobudur Tourism.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Tourists in Borobudur.]]
Following the major 1973 renovation funded by [[UNESCO]],<ref name="1973restoration"/> Borobudur is once again used as a [[place of worship]] and pilgrimage. Once a year, during the [[full moon]] in May or June, [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Buddhists in Indonesia]] observe [[Vesak]] ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Waisak'') day commemorating the birth, death, and the time when [[Gautama Buddha|Siddh<U+0101>rtha Gautama]] attained the highest wisdom to become the Buddha Shakyamuni.

== Architecture == 
[[Image:Borobudur Ground Plan.png|thumb|right|Borobudur ground plan]]
Borobudur is built as a single large [[stupa]], and when viewed from above takes the form of a giant [[Vajrayana|tantric Buddhist]] ''[[mandala]]'', simultaneously representing the Buddhist cosmology and the nature of mind.<ref>{{cite conference|author=A. Wayman| title=Reflections on the Theory of Barabadur as a Mandala| | booktitle=Barabudu History and Significance of a Buddhist Monument| publisher=Asian Humanities Press| location=Berkeley| date=1981}}</ref> The foundation is a square, approximately {{m to ft|118}} on each side. It has nine platforms, of which the lower six are [[Square (geometry)|square]] and the upper three are [[Circle|circular]]. The upper platform features seventy-two small stupas surrounding one large central stupa. Each stupa is bell-shaped and pierced by numerous decorative openings. Statues of the [[Buddha]] sit inside the pierced enclosures.

Approximately {{m3 to ft3|55000}} of stones were taken from neighbouring rivers to build the monument.<ref name="Soekmono16"/> The stone was cut to size, transported to the site and laid without [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]].  Knobs, indentations and [[Dovetail joint|dovetails]] were used to form joints between stones. [[Relief]]s were created ''[[in-situ]]'' after the building had been completed.
The monument is equipped with a good [[drainage]] system to cater for the area's high [[Precipitation (meteorology)|stormwater]] run-off. To avoid innundation, 100 spouts are provided at each corner with a unique carved [[gargoyle]]s (''makaras'').

[[Image:Borobudur spout.jpg|thumb|left|A carved spout (''makara'') for water drainage.]]
Borobudur differs markedly with the general design of other structures built for this purpose. Instead of building on a flat surface, Borobudur is built on a natural hill. The building technique is, however, similar to other temples in Java. With no inner space as in other temples and its general design similar to the shape of [[pyramid]], Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a ''stupa'', instead of a temple.<ref name="Soekmono16">Soekmono (1976), page 16.</ref> A ''stupa'' is intended as a [[shrine]] for the Lord Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of [[deity]] and have inner spaces for worship. The complexity of the monument's meticulous design suggests Borobudur is in fact a temple. Congregational worship in Borobudur is performed by means of pilgrimage. Pilgrims were guided by the system of staircases and corridors ascending to the top platform. Each platform represents one stage of [[Four stages of enlightenment|enlightment]]. The path that guides pilgrims was designed with the symbolism of sacred knowledge according to the [[Buddhist cosmology|Buddhism cosmology]].<ref name="Ferschin2004">{{cite conference|title=Architecture as Information Space|booktitle=8th Int.

A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of Borobudur.<ref name="Atmadi1988"/> The identical ratio formula was further found in the nearby Buddhist temples of Pawon and Mendhut. Archeologists conjectured the purpose of the ratio formula and the ''tala'' dimension has calendrical, astronomical and cosmological themes, as of the case in other Buddhist temple of [[Angkor Wat]] in [[Cambodia]].<ref name="Long"/>

[[Image:Borobudur mural.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A narrow corridor with reliefs on the wall.]]
The main vertical structure can be divided into three groups: base (or foot), body, and top, which resembles the three major division of a human body.<ref name="Long"/> The base is a 123x123&nbsp;m<U+00B2> square in size and {{m to ft|4}} high of walls.<ref name="Soekmono16"/> The body is composed of five square platforms each with diminishing heights. The first terrace is set back {{m to ft|7}} from the edge of the base. The other terraces are set back by {{m to ft|2}}, leaving a narrow corridor at each stage. The top consists of 3 circular platforms, with each stage supporting a row of perforated ''[[stupa]]s'', arranged in [[Concentric|concentric circles]]. There is one main dome at the center; the top of which is the highest point of the monument ({{m to ft|35}} above ground level). Access to the upper part is through stairways at the centre of each side with a number of gates, watched by a total of 32 lion statues. The main entrance is at the eastern side, the location of the first narrative reliefs. On the slopes of the hill, there are also stairways linking the monument to the low-lying plain.

The three monument's division symbolizes three stages of mental preparation towards the ultimate goal according to the Buddhism cosmology, namely ''[[Buddhist cosmology#K.C4.81madh.C4.81tu|Kamadhatu]]'' (the world of desires), ''[[Rupajhana|Rupadhatu]]'' (the world of forms), and finally ''[[Arupajhana|Arupadhatu]]'' (the formless world).<ref>{{cite web|author=Tartakov, Gary Michael|work=Lecture notes for Asian Art and Architecture: Art & Design 382/582|publisher=Iowa State University|title=Lecture 17: Sherman Lee<U+2019>s History of Far Eastern Art (Indonesia and Cambodja)|url=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~tart/arth382/lecture17.html|accessdate=2006-05-21}}</ref> ''Kamadhatu'' is represented by the base, ''Rupadhatu'' by the five square platforms (the body), and ''Arupadhatu'' by the three circular platforms and the large topmost stupa. The architectural features between three stages have methaporical differences. For instance, square and detailed decorations in the ''Rupadhatu'' disappear into plainless circular platforms in the ''Arupadhatu'' to represent how the world of forms - where men are still attached with forms and names - changes into the world of the formless.<ref>Soekmono (1976), page 17.</ref>

In 1885, a hidden structure under the base was accidentally discovered.<ref name="kompas">{{cite news|publisher=[[Kompas]]|title=Borobudur Pernah Salah Design?|language=Indonesian|url=http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0004/07/dikbud/boro09.htm|date=7 April 2000|accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref> The "hidden foot" contains reliefs, 160 of which are narrative describing the real ''Kamadhatu''.

Borobudur contains approximately 2,670 individual [[bas relief]]s (1,460 narrative and 1,212 decorative panels), which cover the [[facades|fa<U+00E7>ades]] and [[balustrade]]s. The total relief surface is {{m2 to ft2|2500}} and they are distributed at the hidden foot (''Kamadhatu'') and the five square platforms (''Rupadhatu'').<ref name="p20"/>

The narrative panels, which tell the story of [[Sudhana]] and Manohara,<ref>{{cite journal|last= Jaini|first=P.S.|title=The Story of Sudhana and Manohara: An Analysis of the Texts and the Borobudur Reliefs|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|volume=29|issue=3|date=1966|pages=533&ndash;558|id=ISSN 0041977X|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0041-977X%281966%2929%3A3%3C533%3ATSOSAM%3E2.0.CO%3B2-V}}</ref> are grouped into 11 series encircled the monument with the total length of {{m to ft|3000}}. The hidden foot contains the first series with 160 narrative panels and the remaining 10 series are distributed throughout walls and balustrades in four galleries starting from the eastern entrance stairway to the left. Narrative panels on the wall read from right to left, while on the balustrade read from left to right. This conforms with ''[[pradaksina]]'', the ritual of circumambulation performed by [[pilgrim]]s who move in a clockwise direction while keeping the [[sanctuary]] to their right.<ref  name="p21">Soekmono (1976), page 21.</ref> 

The hidden foot depicts the story of the [[Karma in Buddhism|karma law]]. The walls of the first gallery have two superimposed series of reliefs; each consists of 120 panels. The upper part depicts the [[Gautama Buddha|biography of Buddha]], while the lower part of the wall and also balustrades in the first and the second galleries tell the story of Buddha's former lives.<ref  name="p20">Soekmono (1976), page 20.</ref> The remaining panels are devoted to Sudhana's further wandering about his search; terminated by his attainment of the [[Perfection of Wisdom|Perfect Wisdom]].

; The law of karma (Karmavibhangga)

The 160 hidden panels do not form a continuous story, but each panel provides one complete illustration of [[Causality|cause and effect]].<ref  name="p20"/> There are depictions of blameworthy activities, from gossip to murder, with their corresponding punishments. There are also praiseworthy activities, that include [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] and pilgrimage to sanctuaries, and their subsequent rewards. The pains of hell and the pleasure of heaven are also illustrated. There are scenes of daily life, complete with the full panorama of ''[[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]]'' (the endless cycle of birth and death).

; The birth of Buddha (Lalitavistara)
[[Image:Borobudur relief 3.jpg|thumb|right|One relief on a corridor wall.]]
{{see also|The birth of Buddha (Lalitavistara)}}

The story starts from the glorious descent of the [[Buddha|Lord Buddha]] from the [[Tushita]] heaven, and ends with his first sermon in the Deer Park near [[Benares]].<ref name="p21"/> The relief shows the birth of Buddha as [[Gautama Buddha|Prince Siddharta]], son of [[Suddhodana|King Suddhodana]] and [[Queen Maya]] of [[Kapilavastu]] (in present-day [[Nepal]]).

The story is preceded by 27 panels showing various preparations, in heavens and on earth, to welcome the final incarnation of [[Bodhisattva]].<ref name="p21"/> Before descending from Tushita heaven, Bodhisattva entrusted his crown to his successor, the future [[Maitreya|Buddha Maitreya]]. He descended on earth in the shape of [[white elephant]]s with six [[tusk]]s, penetrated to Queen Maya's right womb. Queen Maya had a dream of this event, which was interpreted that his son would become either a sovereign or a Buddha.

While Queen Maya felt that it was the time to give the birth, she went to the [[Lumbini]] park outside the Kapilavastu city. She stood under a [[plaksa]] tree, holding one branch with her right hand and she gave birth to a son, Prince Siddharta. The story on the panels continues until the prince became Buddha.

[[Image:Borobodur2.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A detailed carved relief stone.]]

; Prince Siddharta story (Jataka) and other legendary persons (Avadana)

[[Jataka]]s are stories about the Buddha before he was born as Prince Siddharta.<ref name="Soekmono26">Soekmono (1976), page 26.</ref> [[Avadana]]s are similar with jatakas, but the main figure is not Bodhisattva himself. The saintly deeds in avadanas are attributed to other legendary persons. Jatakas and avadanas are treated in one and the same series in the reliefs of Borobudur.

The first 20 lower panels in the first gallery on the wall depict the ''Sudhanakumaravadana'' or the saintly deeds of [[Sudhana]]. The first 135 upper panels in the same gallery on the balustrades are devoted to the 34 legends of the ''[[Jatakamala]]''.<ref name="Soekmono29">Soekmono (1976), page 29.</ref> The remaining 237 panels depict stories from other sources, as do for the lower series and panels in the second gallery. Some jatakas stories are depicted twice, for example the story of King Sibhi ([[Rama]]'s forefather).

; Sudhana search of the Ultimate Truth (Gandavyuha)

Gandavyuha is the story told in the final chapter of the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]] about [[Sudhana]]'s tireless wandering in search of the Highest Perfect Wisdom. It covers two galleries (third and fourth) and also half of the second gallery; comprising in total of 460 panels.<ref name="Soekmono32">Soekmono (1976), page 32.</ref> The principal figure of the story, the youth Sudhana, son of an extremely rich merchant, appears on the 16th panel. The preceding 15 panels form a [[prologue]] to the story of the miracles during Buddha's ''[[samadhi]]'' in the [[Jetavana|Garden of Jeta]] at [[Sravasti]].

During his search, Sudhana visited no less than 30 teachers but none of them had satisfied him completely. He was then instructed by [[Manjusri]] to meet the monk Megasri, where he was given the first doctrine. Sudhana journey continues to meet (in the following order) Supratisthita, the physician Megha (Spirit of Knowledge), the banker Muktaka, the monk Saradhvaja, the [[upasaka|upasika]] Asa (Spirit of Supreme Enlightment), Bhismottaranirghosa, the [[Brahmin]] Jayosmayatna, Princess Maitrayani, the monk Sudarsana, a boy called Indriyesvara, the upasika Prabhuta, the banker Ratnachuda, [[Anala|King Anala]], the god [[Shiva|Siva Mahadeva]], [[Queen Maya]], [[Maitreya|Bodhisattva Maitreya]] and then back to Manjusri. Each meeting has given Sudhana a specific doctrine, knowledge and wisdom. These meetings are shown in the third gallery.

After the last meeting with Manjusri, Sudhana went to the residence of [[Samantabhadra|Bodhisattva Samantabhadra]]; depicted in the fourth gallery. The entire series of the fourth gallery is devoted to the teaching of Samantabhadra. The narrative panels finally end with the Sudhana's achievement of the Supreme Knowledge and the Ultimate Truth.<ref name="p35">Soekmono (1976), page 35.</ref>

== Buddha statues ==
[[Image:Borobudur-perfect-buddha.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A Buddha statue with the hand position of ''[[Dharmachakra|dharmachakra mudra]]'' (turning the Wheels of the Law).]]

Apart from the story of [[Buddhist cosmology]] carved in stones, Borobudur has many statues of Buddha. The cross-legged statues are seated in a [[lotus position]] and distributed on the five square platforms (the ''Rupadhatu'' level) as well as on the top platform (the ''Arupadhatu'' level). 

The Buddha statues are in niches at the ''Rupadhatu'' level, arranged in rows on the outer sides of the balustrades, the number of statues decreasing as platforms progressively diminish to the upper level. The first balustrades have 104 niches, the second 104, the third 88, the fourth 72 and the fifth 64. In total, there are 432 Buddha status at the ''Rupadhatu'' level.<ref name="p35-36">Soekmono (1976), page 35-36.</ref> At the ''Arupadhatu'' level (or the three circular platforms), Buddha statues are placed inside perforated [[stupa]]s. The first circular platform has 32 stupas, the second 24 and the third 16, that add up to 72 stupas.<ref name="p35-36"/> Of the original 504 Buddha statues, over 300 are damaged (mostly headless) and 43 are missing (since the monument's discovery, heads have been stolen as collector's items, mostly by Western museums).<ref>{{cite journal| title=Acquisition |journal=Critical Inquiry |author=Hiram W. Woodward Jr. |volume=6 |issue=2 |date=1979 |pages=291&mdash;303}}</ref>

[[Image:Headless Buddha.jpg|right|thumb|A headless Buddha statue inside a stupa.]]
At glance, all Buddha statues are equal, but there is a subtle difference between them in the ''[[mudra]]s'' or the position of the hands. There are five groups of ''mudra'': North, East, South, West and Zenith, which represent the five cardinal compass according to [[Mahayana]]. The first four balustrades have the first four ''mudras'': North, East, South and West, of which Buddha statues that face one compass direction has the corresponding ''mudra''. Buddha statues at the fifth balustrades and inside the 72 stupas on the top platform have the same ''mudra'': [[Zenith]]. Each ''mudra'' represent one of the [[Five Dhyani Buddhas]]; each has its own symbolism.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Twilight Language: Explorations in Buddhist Meditation and Symbolism|author= Roderick S. Bucknell and Martin Stuart-Fox|publisher= Routledge|location=UK|date=1995|id=ISBN 0700702342}}</ref> They are ''Abhaya mudra'' for [[Amoghasiddhi]] (north), ''Vara mudra'' for [[Ratnasambhava]] (south), ''Dhyana mudra'' for [[Amitabha]] (west), ''Bhumisparsa mudra'' for [[Aksobhya]] (east) and ''[[Dharmachakra|Dharmachakra mudra]]''  for [[Vairochana]] (zenith).

==Restoration==
[[Image:Borobudur restoration.png|thumb|right|250px|Embedding [[concrete]] and [[Polyvinyl chloride|pvc]] [[Pipe (material)|pipe]] to improve Borobudur's drainage system during the 1973 restoration.]]
Borobudur attracted attention in 1885, when Yzerman, the Chairman of the Archaeological Society in Yogyakarta, made a discovery about the ''hidden foot''.<ref name="kompas"/> Photographs that reveal reliefs on the hidden foot were made in 1890&ndash;1891.<ref name="p43">Soekmono (1976), page 43.</ref> The discovery has led the [[Dutch East Indies]] government to take a necessary step to safeguard the monument. In 1900, the government set up a commission consisted of three officials to assess the monument: Brandes, an [[Art history|art historian]], Theodoor van Erp, a [[Royal Netherlands Army|Dutch army]] engineer officer, and Van de Kamer, a construction engineer from the Department of Public Works.

In 1902, the commission submitted a threefold plan of proposal to the government. First, the immediate dangers should be avoided by resetting the corners, removing stones that endangers the adjacent parts, strengthening the first balustrades and restoring several niches, archways, stupas and the main dome. Second, fencing off the courtyards, providing proper maintenance and improving drainage by restoring floors and spouts. Third, all loose stones should be removed, cleared up the monument up to the first balustrades, removed disfigured stones and restored the main dome. The total cost was estimated at that time around 48,800 [[Dutch guilder]]s.

The restoration then was carried out between 1907&ndash;1911, using the principles of [[anastylosis]] and led by Theodor van Erp.<ref name="unesco2004">{{cite press release|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|title=UNESCO experts mission to Prambanan and Borobudur Heritage Sites|date=31 August 2004}}</ref> The first seven months of his restoration was excavating the grounds around the monument to find missing Buddha heads and panel stones. Van Erp dismantled and rebuilt the upper three circular platforms and stupas. Along the way, Van Erp discovered more things to improve the monument that he submitted another proposal that was agreed with the additional cost of 34,600 guilders. At first glance Borobudur had been restored to its old glory.

Due to the limited budget, the restoration had been primarily focused on cleaning the sculptures, but Van Erp did not solve the drainage problem. Within fifteen years, the gallery walls were sagging and the reliefs showed signs of new cracks and deterioration.<ref name="unesco2004"/> Van Erp used concrete from which [[alkali salt]]s and [[calcium hydroxide]] leached and were transported into the rest of the construction. This has caused some problems that a further thorough renovation is urgently needed.

Small restorations have been performed since then, but not for a complete protection. In the late 1960s, the [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian government]] had requested a major renovation to protect the monument to the international community. In 1973, a master plan to restore Borobudur was created.<ref name="1973restoration">{{cite journal|title=The Restoration and Conservation Project of Borobudur Temple, Indonesia. Planning: Research: Design|author=Caesar Voute|journal=Studies in Conservation|volume=18|issue=3|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1505654|date=1973|pages=113&ndash;130}}</ref> The Indonesian government and [[UNESCO]] then undertook the complete overhaul of the monument in a big restoration project between 1975&ndash;1982.<ref name="unesco2004"/> The foundation was stabilized and all 1,460 panels were cleaned. The restoration involved the dismantling of the five square platforms and improved the drainage by embedding water channels into the monument. Both impermeable and filter layers were added. This colossal project involved around 600 people to restore the monument and cost in total of [[USD|US$]] 6,901,243.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|title=Cultural heritage and partnership; 1999|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001163/116321Eo.pdf|accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref> After the renovation was finished, UNESCO listed Borobudur as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/592|accessdate=2006-12-05|title=Borobudur Temple Compounds|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|work=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}</ref>
