'''Athanassios Spyridon Fokas''' ({{lang-el|<U+0391><U+03B8><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03AC><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+03A3><U+03C0><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03B4><U+03C9><U+03BD> <U+03A6><U+03C9><U+03BA><U+03AC><U+03C2>}}; b. June 30, 1952) is a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[mathematician]], known for work in the field of [[integrability conditions for differential systems|integrable]] [[nonlinear]] [[partial differential equations]]. 

==Biography==

Fokas earned a BS in [[Aeronautics]] from [[Imperial College]] in 1975 and a PhD in [[Applied mathematics]] from [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] in 1979. His dissertation, ''Invariants, Lie-Backlund Operators and Backlund Transformations'', was written under the direction of [[Paco Lagerstrom]]. Fokas subsequently attended [[University of Miami]] School of Medicine, earning an MD in 1986.

After medical school, Fokas was appointed Professor and Chair of the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at [[Clarkson University]] in 1986. From there, he moved to [[Imperial College]] in 1996 to become chair of Applied Mathematics. He has been a Professor of Mathematics at [[University of Cambridge]] and Chair in Nonlinear Mathematical Science since 2002. He was elected a Member of the Academy of Athens in 2004 and a professorial fellow of [[Clare Hall, Cambridge]] in 2005.

Fokas received the [[Naylor Prize]] from the [[London Mathematical Society]] in 2000.<ref>[http://www.lms.ac.uk/activities/prizes_com/pastwinners.html Prize winners.] [[London Mathematical Society]]. Accessed July 19, 2010  </ref>

Fokas is married to Regina Fokas and they have three children: Alexander, Anastassia, and Ioanna.

==Work==

Broadly speaking, Fokas' work is concentrated in applied mathematics and mathematical physics. He has examined a large class of [[partial differential equations]], both linear and non-linear, and especially including [[Boundary value problem|boundary value problems]]. Much of his work has naturally extended to applied areas, such as [[fluid mechanics]], [[medical imaging]], and [[protein folding]]. His body of work has been published in over 150 peer-reviewed journal articles and he is listed as highly-cited researcher in mathematics in the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] citation database.
