'''Marcus Aurelius Valerius Maximianus Herculius''' (''ca''. 250&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;''ca''. July 310<ref name="BNNE32"/>), commonly referred to as '''Maximian''', was [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] (junior [[Roman Emperor]]) from July 285<ref name="CAESDATEa"/><ref name="CAESDATEb"/>  and [[Augustus (title)|Augustus]] (senior Roman Emperor) from [[April 1]] [[286]]<ref name="AUGDATE"/> to [[May 1]] [[305]].<ref name="BNE4"/> He shared the latter title with his co-emperor and superior, [[Diocletian]], whose political brain complemented Maximian's military brawn. Maximian established his residence at [[Trier]] but spent most of his time on campaign. In the late summer of 285, he suppressed rebels in Gaul known as the [[Bagaudae]]. From 285 to 288, he fought against Germanic tribes along the Rhine frontier. Together with Diocletian, he ran a [[scorched earth]] campaign deep into the territory of the [[Alamanni]] tribes in 288, temporarily relieving the Rhenish provinces from the threat of Germanic invasion.

The man he appointed to police the [[English Channel|Channel]] shores, [[Carausius]], rebelled in 286, causing the secession of Britain and northwestern Gaul. Maximian failed to oust Carausius, and his invasion fleet was destroyed by storms in 289 or 290. Maximan's subordinate, [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]], campaigned against Carausius' successor, [[Allectus]], while Maximian held the Rhenish frontier. The rebel leader was ousted in 296, and Maximian moved south to combat [[Moor]]ish pirates in Iberia and [[Berber]] incursions in [[Mauretania]]. When these campaigns concluded in 298, he departed for Italy, where he lived in comfort until 305. At Diocletian's behest, Maximian abdicated on [[May 1]] [[305]], gave the Augustan office to Constantius, and retired to southern Italy.

In late 306, Maximian took the title of Augustus again and aided his son [[Maxentius]]' rebellion in Italy. In April 307, he attempted to depose his son, but failed and fled to the court of Constantius' successor, [[Constantine I|Constantine]], in Trier. At the Council of [[Carnuntum]] in November 308, Diocletian and his successor, [[Galerius]], forced Maximian to renounce his imperial claim again. In early 310, Maximian attempted to seize Constantine's title while the emperor was on campaign on the Rhine. Few supported him, and he was captured by Constantine in Marseille. Maximian committed suicide in the summer of 310 on Constantine's orders. During Constantine's war with Maxentius, Maximian's image was purged from all public places. However, after Constantine ousted and killed Maxentius, Maximian's image was rehabilitated, and he was deified.

==Early life==

Maximian was born near [[Sirmium]] ([[Sremska Mitrovica]], [[Serbia]]) in the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Pannonia]], around 250 into a family of shopkeepers.<ref>''Epitome de Caesaribus'' 40.10, quoted in Barnes, ''New Empire'', 32; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 32; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 30; Williams, 43&ndash;44.</ref> Beyond that, the ancient sources contain vague allusions to [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] as his homeland,<ref>Victor, ''Liber de Caesaribus'' 39.26, quoted in Barnes, ''New Empire'', 32.</ref> to his Pannonian virtues,<ref>''Panegrici Latini'' 10(2).2.2ff, quoted in Barnes, ''New Empire'', 32.</ref> and to his harsh upbringing along the war-torn [[Danube]] frontier.<ref>''Panegrici Latini'' 10(2).2.4, quoted in Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 44&ndash;45.</ref> Maximian joined the army, serving with [[Diocletian]] under the emperors [[Aurelian]] (r. 270&ndash;275) and [[Probus]] (r. 276&ndash;282). He probably participated in the Mesopotamian campaign of [[Carus]] in 283 and attended Diocletian's election as emperor on [[November 20]] [[284]] at [[Nicomedia]].<ref>Barnes, ''New Empire'', 32&ndash;33; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 30.</ref> Maximian's swift appointment by Diocletian as Caesar is taken by the writer Stephen Williams and historian [[Timothy Barnes]] to mean that the two men were longterm allies, that their respective roles were pre-agreed and that Maximian had probably supported Diocletian during his campaign against [[Carinus]] (r. 283&ndash;285) but there is no direct evidence for this.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Williams, 43&ndash;44.</ref>

With his great energy, firm aggressive character and disinclination to rebel, Maximian was an appealing candidate for imperial office. The fourth-century historian [[Aurelius Victor]] described Maximian as "a colleague trustworthy in friendship, if somewhat boorish, and of great military talents".<ref>Victor, ''Liber de Caesaribus'' 39, quoted in Williams, 44.</ref> Despite his other qualities, Maximian was uneducated and preferred action to thought. The panegyrist of 289, after comparing his actions to [[Scipio Africanus]]' victories over [[Hannibal]] during the [[Second Punic War]], suggested that Maximian has never heard of them.<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 10(2), quoted in Williams, 44.</ref> His ambitions were purely military; he left politics to Diocletian.<ref>Williams, 44.</ref> The [[Christian]] [[Rhetoric|rhetor]] [[Lactantius]] suggested that Maximian shared Diocletian's basic attitudes but was less puritanical in his tastes, and took advantage of the sensual opportunities his position as emperor offered.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 13.</ref> Lactantius charged that Maximian defiled senator's daughters and traveled with young virgins to satisfy his unending lust, though Lactantius' credibility is undermined by his hostility towards pagans.<ref>Lactantius, ''DMP'' 8, quoted in Williams, 44.</ref>

Maximian had two children with his [[Syria]]n wife, [[Eutropia]]: Maxentius and [[Fausta]]. There is no direct evidence in the ancient sources for their birthdates. Modern estimates of Maxentius' birth year have varied from circa 277 to circa 287, and most date Fausta's birth to circa 298.<ref>Barnes, ''New Empire'', 34. Barnes dates Maxentius' birth to circa 283, when Maximian was in Syria, and Fausta's birth to 289 or 290 (Barnes, ''New Empire'', 34).</ref> [[Flavia Maximiana Theodora|Theodora]], the wife of [[Constantius Chlorus]], is often called Maximian's stepdaughter by ancient sources, leading to claims by [[Otto Seeck]] and Ernest Stein that she was born from an earlier marriage between Eutropia and Afranius Hannibalianus.<ref>Aurelius Victor, ''de Caesaribus'' 39.25; Eutropius, ''Breviaria'' 9.22; Jerome, ''Chronicle'' 225<sup>g</sup>; ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' 39.2, 40.12, quoted in Barnes, ''New Empire'', 33; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 33.</ref> Barnes challenges this view, saying that all "stepdaughter" sources derive their information from the partially unreliable work of history ''[[Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte|Kaisergeschichte]]'', while other, more reliable sources, refer to her as Maximian's natural daughter.<ref>''Origo Constantini'' 2; Philostorgius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 2.16<sup>a</sup>, quoted in Barnes, ''New Empire'', 33. See also ''Panegyrici Latini'' 10(2)11.4.</ref> Barnes concludes that Theodora was born no later than circa 275 to an unnamed earlier wife of Maximian, possibly one of Hannibalianus' daughters.<ref>Barnes, ''New Empire'', 33&ndash;34.</ref>

==Appointment as Caesar==

<!-- I'd be happier if the reasons why came first but I can't think of a neat way of doing this at the moment.-->
At [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]], [[Italy]]) in July 285,<ref>The event has been dated to both [[July 21]] (Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 4) and [[July 25]] (Potter, 280&ndash;81).</ref> Diocletian proclaimed Maximian as his co-ruler, or [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]].<ref>Bleckmann; Corcoran, "Before Constantine", 40.</ref> The reasons for this decision are complex. With conflict in every province of the empire, from Gaul to Syria, from Egypt to the lower Danube, Diocletian needed a lieutenant to manage his heavy workload.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 30; Southern, 136.</ref> Historian Stephen Williams suggests that Diocletian considered himself a mediocre general and needed a man like Maximian to do most of his fighting.<ref>Williams, 45.</ref>

Next, Diocletian was vulnerable in that he had no sons <U+2013> just a daughter, Valeria <U+2013> who could never succeed him. He was forced therefore to seek a co-ruler from outside his family and that co-ruler had to be someone he trusted.<ref>Potter, 280; Southern, 136; Williams, 43.</ref> (The historian William Seston has argued that Diocletian, like heirless emperors before him, adopted Maximian as his ''filius Augusti'' ("Augustan son") upon his appointment to the office. Some agree, but the historian [[Frank Kolb]] has stated that arguments for the adoption are based on misreadings of the papyrological evidence.<ref>Odahl, 42&ndash;43; Southern, 136, 331; 
Williams, 45.</ref>)

Finally, Diocletian knew that single rule was dangerous and that precedent existed for dual rulership. Despite their military prowess, both sole-emperors Aurelian and Probus had been easily removed from power.<ref name="P280">Potter, 280.</ref> In contrast, just a few years earlier, the emperor Carus and his sons had ruled jointly, albeit not for long. Even the first emperor, [[Augustus]], (r. 27 BC&ndash;AD 19), had shared power with his colleagues and more formal offices of co-emperor had existed from [[Marcus Aurelius]] (r. 161&ndash;180) on.<ref>Corcoran, "Before Constantine", 40.</ref> 

The dual system evidently worked well. About 287, the two rulers' relationship was re-defined in religious terms, with Diocletian assuming the title ''Iovius'' and Maximian ''Herculius''.<ref>Corcoran, "Before Constantine", 40; Liebeschuetz, ''Continuity and Change'', 235&ndash;52, 240<U+2013>43; Odahl, 43&ndash;44; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 32&ndash;33.</ref> The titles were pregnant with symbolism: Diocletian-[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]] had the dominant role of planning and commanding; Maximian-[[Hercules]] the [[hero]]ic role of completing assigned tasks.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 11&ndash;12; Corcoran, "Before Constantine", 40; Odahl, 43; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 32&ndash;33, 39, 42&ndash;52; Southern, 136&ndash;37; Williams, 58&ndash;59.</ref> Yet despite the symbolism, the emperors were "gods" in the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] tradition (although they may have been hailed as such in Imperial panegyrics). Instead, they were the gods' instruments, imposing the gods' will on earth.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 11.</ref> Once the rituals were over, Maximian assumed control of the government of the West and dispatched to Gaul to fight the rebels known as [[Bagaudae]] while Diocletian returned to the East.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Southern, 137; Williams, 45&ndash;46.</ref>

==Early campaigns in Gaul and Germany==
The Bagaudae of Gaul are obscure figures, appearing fleetingly in the ancient sources, with their 285 uprising being their first appearance.<ref>Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 29.</ref> The fourth-century historian [[Eutropius]] described them as rural people under the leadership of [[Aelianus (rebel)|Amandus and Aelianus]], while Aurelius Victor called them bandits.<ref>Eutropius, ''Brev''. 9.20; Aurelius Victor, ''de Caesaribus'', 39.17, quoted in Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 29&ndash;30.</ref> The historian David S. Potter suggests that they were more than peasants, seeking either Gallic political autonomy or reinstatement of the recently deposed Carus (a native of [[Gallia Narbonensis]], in what would become southern [[France]]): in this case, they would be defecting imperial troops, not brigands.<ref>Potter, 281&ndash;82.</ref> Although poorly equipped, led and trained <U+2013> and therefore a poor match for Roman legions <U+2013> Diocletian certainly considered the Bagaudae sufficient threat to merit an emperor to counter them.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 10; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 30; Southern, 137; Williams, 45&ndash;46.</ref>

Maximian traveled to Gaul, engaging the Bagaudae late in the summer of 285.<ref>Barnes, ''New Empire'', 57.</ref> Details of the campaign are sparse and provide no tactical detail: the historical sources dwell only on Maximian's virtues and victories. The 289 [[Panegyrici Latini|panegyric]] to Maximian records that the rebels were defeated with a blend of harshness and leniency.<ref name="S137">Southern, 137.</ref> As the campaign was against the empire's own citizens, and therefore distasteful, it went unrecorded in [[Victory title|titles]] and official [[Roman triumph|triumphs]]. Indeed, Maximian's panegyrist declares: "I pass quickly over this episode, for I see in your magnanimity you would rather forget this victory than celebrate it."<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 10(2), quoted in Williams, 46; Southern, 137.</ref> By the end of the year, the revolt had significantly abated, and Maximian moved the bulk of his forces to the Rhine frontier, heralding a period of stability.<ref>Southern, 139&ndash;138; Williams, 46.</ref>

Maximian did not put down the Bagaudae swiftly enough to avoid a Germanic reaction. In the autumn of 285, two barbarian armies <U+2013> one of [[Burgundians]] and [[Alamanni]], the other of Chaibones and [[Heruli]] <U+2013> forded the Rhine and entered Gaul.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 57; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 31.</ref> The first army was left to die of disease and hunger, while Maximian intercepted and defeated the second.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6.</ref> He then established a Rhine headquarters in preparation for future campaigns,<ref>Williams, 46.</ref> either at Moguntiacum ([[Mainz]], [[Germany]]), Augusta Treverorum ([[Trier]], Germany), or Colonia Agrippina ([[Cologne]], Germany).<ref>Potter, 282&ndash;83. Potter and Barnes (''New Empire'', 56) favor Trier; Williams (''Diocletian'', 46) favors Mainz.</ref>

==Carausius==
{{seealso|Carausius|Carausian Revolt}}
[[Image:romanantefix.jpg<U+200E>|thumb|right|A Roman [[Ante-fixae|antefix]] roof tile showing the badge and standard of [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix]], one of the legions that joined Carausius' rebellion]]
Although most of Gaul was pacified, regions bordering the [[English Channel]] still suffered from [[Franks|Frankish]] and [[Saxons|Saxon]] [[piracy]]. The emperors Probus and Carinus had begun to fortify the [[Saxon Shore]], but much remained to be done.<ref>Southern, 138; Williams, 46.</ref> For example, there is no archaeological evidence of naval bases at [[Dover]] and [[Boulogne]] during 270<U+2013>285.<ref>Potter, 284.</ref> In response to the pirate problem, Maximian appointed [[Carausius|Mausaeus Carausius]], a [[Menapii|Menapian]] from [[Germania Inferior]] (southern and western [[Netherlands]]) to command the Channel and to clear it of raiders.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 57.</ref> Carausius did well and, by the end of 285, was capturing pirate ships in great numbers.<ref>Southern, 138; Williams, 46&ndash;47.</ref>

Maximian soon heard that Carausius was waiting until the pirates had finished plundering before attacking and that their booty was going into Carausius' pockets instead of to the population at large or into the imperial treasury.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 6&ndash;7; Potter, 283&ndash;84; Southern, 137&ndash;41; Williams, 47.</ref> Maximian ordered Carausius' arrest and execution, prompting him to flee the continent to Britain. Carausius' support among the British was strong, and at least two British legions ([[Legio II Augusta|II Augusta]] and [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|XX Valeria Victrix]]) defected to him, as did some or all of a legion near Boulogne (probably [[Legio XXX Ulpia Victrix|XXX Ulpia Victrix]]).<ref>Potter, 284; Southern, 139&ndash;40; Williams, 47. Most of the information for the legions under Carausius' control comes from his coinage. Strangely, [[Legio VI Victrix]] from [[Eboracum]] ([[York]], United Kingdom), which, for geographical regions, should have been included in the legions Carausius had control over, generally is not (Southern, 332). The ''Panegyrici Latini'' 8(4)12.1 admits one continental legion joined him, probably the XXX Ulpia Victrix (Potter, 650).</ref> Carausius quickly eliminated the few remaining loyalists in his army and declared himself Augustus.<ref name="W47">Williams, 47.</ref>

Maximian could do little about the revolt. He had no fleet <U+2013> he had given it to Casausius <U+2013> and was busy quelling the [[Heruli]] and the Franks. Meanwhile, Carausius strengthened his position by enlarging his fleet, enlisting Frankish mercenaries, and paying his troops well.<ref name="W47"/> By the autumn of 286, Britain, much of northwestern Gaul, and the entire Channel coast, was under his control.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7; Southern, 140.</ref> Casausius declared himself head of an independent British state, an ''Imperium Britanniarum'' and issued coin of a markedly higher purity than that of Maximian and Diocletian, earning the support of British and Gallic merchants.<ref>Williams, 47&ndash;48.</ref> Even Maximian's troops were vulnerable to Carausius' influence and wealth.<ref>Potter, 284; Williams, 61&ndash;62.</ref>

==Maximian appointed Augustus==

Spurred by the crisis with Carausius, on [[April 1]] [[286]],<ref name="AUGDATE"/> Maximian took the title of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7; Bleckmann; Corcoran, "Before Constantine", 40; Potter, 282; Southern, 141&ndash;42; Williams, 48.</ref> This gave him the same status as Carausius <U+2013> so the clash was between two Augusti, rather than between an Augustus and a Caesar <U+2013> and, in imperial propaganda, Maximian was proclaimed Diocletian's brother, his equal in authority and prestige.<ref>Williams, 48.</ref> Diocletian could not have been present at Maximian's appointment,<ref>Potter, 282, 649. Diocletian would have been somewhere between [[Byzantium]] ([[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]), where he is attested for [[March 22]] [[286]] and [[Tiberias]], where he is attested from [[May 31]] [[286]] through [[August 31]] (Barnes, ''New Empire'', 50&ndash;51; Potter, 282, 649).</ref> causing Seeck to suggest that Maximian usurped the title and was only later recognized by Diocletian in hopes of avoiding civil war. This suggestion has not won much support, and the historian William Leadbetter has recently refuted it.<ref>Potter, 282, 649.</ref> Despite the physical distance between the emperors, Diocletian trusted Maximian enough to invest him with imperial powers, and Maximian still respected Diocletian enough to act in accordance with his will.<ref>Potter, 282; Williams, 49.</ref>

In theory, the Roman Empire was not divided by the dual imperium. Though divisions did take place &ndash; each emperor had his own court, army, and official residences &ndash; these were matters of practicality, not substance. Imperial propaganda from 287 on insists on a singular and indivisible Rome, a ''patrimonium indivisum''.<ref>Potter, 283; Williams, 49, 65.</ref> As the panegyrist of 289 declares to Maximian: "So it is that this great empire is a communal possession for both of you, without any discord, nor would we endure there to be any dispute between you, but plainly you hold the state in equal measure as once those two [[Heracleidae]], the [[Kings of Sparta|Spartan Kings]], had done."<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 10(2)9.4, quoted in Potter, 283.</ref> Legal rulings were given and imperial celebrations took place in both emperors' names; the same coins were issued in both parts of the empire.<ref>Potter, 283; Williams, 49, 65.</ref> Diocletian sometimes issued commands to Maximian's province of Africa; Maximian could presumably do the same for Diocletian's territory.<ref>Potter, 283.</ref>

==Campaigns against Rhenish tribes==
===Campaigns in 286 and 287===

Maximian realized that he could not immediately suppress Carausius and campaigned instead against Rhenish tribes.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7; Corcoran, "Before Constantine", 40.</ref> These tribes were probably greater threats to Gallic peace than Carausius in any case and included many supporters of Carausius.<ref>Southern, 141; Williams, 50.</ref> Although Maximian had many enemies along the river, they were more often in dispute with each other than in combat with the empire.<ref name="W50">Williams, 50.</ref> Few clear dates survive for Maximian's campaigns on the Rhine beyond a general range of 285 to 288.<ref>Southern, 142. Barnes' ''New Empire'' records five dates for the period: the first, [[February 10]] [[286]] at Milan (''Codex Justinianus'' 8.53(54).6; ''Fragmenta Vaticana'' 282); [[June 21]] [[286]] at Mainz (''Fragmenta Vaticana'' 271); [[January 1]] [[287]] Trier or Cologne or Mainz (date of consular assumption, ''Panegyrici Latini'' 10(2).6.2 ff.); and 287, his "expedition across the Rhine" (''Panegyrici Latini'' 10(2).7.1ff.) (Barnes, ''New Empire'', 57).</ref> 
While receiving the consular ''fasces'' on [[January 1]] [[287]], Maximian was interrupted by news of a barbarian raid. Doffing his toga and donning his armor, he marched against the barbarians and, although they were not entirely dispersed, he celebrated a victory in Gaul later that year.<ref name="BCE7"/>

Maximian believed the Burgundian and Alemanni tribes of the [[Moselle]]-[[Vosges]] region to be the greatest threat, so he targeted them first. He campaigned using [[scorched earth]] tactics, laying waste to their land and reducing their numbers through famine and disease. After the Burgundians and Alemanni, Maximian moved against the weaker Heruli and Chaibones. He cornered and defeated them in a single battle. He fought in person, riding along the battle line until the Germanic forces broke. Roman forces pursued the fleeing tribal armies and routed them. With his enemies from starvation,<ref name="W50"/> Maximian launched a great invasion across the Rhine.<ref>Barnes, ''New Empire'', 57; Williams, 50.</ref> He moved deep into Germanic territory, bringing destruction to his enemies' homelands,<ref name="W50"/> and demonstrating the superiority of Roman arms.<ref name="BCE7"/> By the winter of 287, he had the advantage and the Rhenish lands were free of Germanic tribesmen.<ref name="W50"/>

===Joint campaign against the Alamanni===
The following spring, as Maximian made preparations for dealing with Carausius, Diocletian returned from the East.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7; Southern, 142&ndash;43; Williams, 50.</ref> The emperors met that year, but neither date nor place is known with certainty.<ref>Barnes, ''New Empire'', 57; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 31.</ref> They probably agreed on a joint campaign against the Alamanni and a naval expedition against Carausius.<ref>Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 31; Southern, 142&ndash;43; Williams, 50. Barnes (''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7) dates the meeting to after the campaign against the Alamanni.</ref>

Later in the year, Maximian led a surprise invasion of the [[Agri Decumates]] &ndash; a region between the upper Rhine and upper Danube deep within Alamanni territory &ndash; while Diocletian invaded Germany via [[Raetia]]. Both emperors burned crops and food supplies as they went, destroying the Germans' means of sustenance.<ref>Southern, 142&ndash;43; Williams, 50.</ref> They added large swathes of territory to the empire and allowed Maximian's build-up to proceed without further disturbance.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7; Corcoran, "Before Constantine", 40; Southern, 143; Williams, 50.</ref> In the aftermath of the war, towns along the Rhine were rebuilt, bridgeheads created on the eastern banks at such places as Mainz and Cologne, and a military frontier was established, comprising forts, roads, and fortified towns. A military highway through Tornacum ([[Tournai]], [[Belgium]]), Bavacum ([[Bavay]], France), Atuatuca Tungrorum ([[Tongeren]], Belgium), Mosae Trajectum ([[Maastricht]], Netherlands), and Cologne connected points along the frontier.<ref name="W5051">Williams, 50&ndash;51.</ref>

===Constantius, Gennobaudes, and resettlement===

In early 288, Maximian appointed his praetorian prefect [[Constantius Chlorus|Flavius Constantius]], husband of Maximian's daughter [[Flavia Maximiana Theodora|Theodora]], to lead a campaign against Carausius' Frankish allies. These Franks controlled the Rhine [[estuary|estuaries]], thwarting sea-attacks against Carausius. Constantius moved north through their territory, wreaking havoc, and reaching the [[North Sea]]. The Franks sued for peace and in the subsequent settlement Maximian reinstated the deposed Frankish king Gennobaudes.<ref name="BCE7"/> Gennobaudes became Maximian's vassal and, with lesser Frankish chiefs in turn swearing loyalty to Gennobaudes, Roman regional dominance was assured.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7; Williams, 51.</ref> 

Maximian allowed a settlement of [[Frisians]], [[Salian Franks]], [[Chamavi]] and other tribes along a strip of Roman territory, either between the Rhine and [[Waal (river)|Waal]] rivers from Noviomagus ([[Nijmegen]], Netherlands) to Traiectum ([[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], Netherlands)<ref name="W5051"/> or near Trier.<ref name="BCE7">Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7.</ref> These tribes were allowed to settle only on condition they acknowledged Roman dominance. Their presence, providing a ready pool of manpower and preventing the settlement of other Frankish tribes, gave Maximian a buffer along the northern Rhine and reduced his need to garrison the region.<ref name="W5051"/>

==Later campaigns in Britain and Gaul==
===Failed expedition against Carausius===
[[Image:Antoninianus Carausius leg4-RIC 0069v.jpg|thumb|right|[[Carausius]], rebel emperor of [[Roman Britain]]]]
By 289, Maximian was prepared to invade Carausius' Britain but, for some reason, the plan failed. Maximian's panegyrist of 289 was optimistic about the campaign's prospects; but the panegyrist of 291 made no mention of it.<ref>Southern, 143.</ref> Constantius' panegyrist suggested that his fleet was lost to a storm,<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 8(5)12.2; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 7, 288; Potter, 284&ndash;85, 650; Southern, 143; Williams, 55.</ref> but this might simply have been to diminish the embarrassment of defeat.<ref>Southern, 143; Williams, 55.</ref> Diocletian curtailed his Eastern province tour soon after, perhaps on learning of Maximian's failure.<ref>Potter, 285; Southern, 144.</ref> Diocletian returned in haste to the West, reaching Emesa by [[May 10]] [[290]],<ref>''Codex Justinianus'' 9.41.9; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 51; Potter, 285, 650.</ref> and Sirmium on the Danube by [[July 1]] [[290]].<ref>''Codex Justinianus'' 6.30.6; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 52; Potter, 285, 650.</ref>

Diocletian met Maximian in Milan either in late December 290 or January 291.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8; Potter, 285.</ref> Crowds gathered to witness the emperors descend on the city and the emperors devoted much time to public pageantry.<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 11(3)10, quoted in Williams, 57.</ref> Potter, among others, has surmised that the ceremonies were arranged to demonstrate Diocletian's continuing support for his faltering colleague. The rulers discussed matters of politics and war in secret,<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8; Potter, 285, 288; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 69.</ref> and they may have considered the idea of expanding the imperial college to include four emperors (the [[Tetrarchy]]).<ref>Potter, 285; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 69.</ref> Meanwhile, a deputation from the Roman Senate met with the rulers and renewed their infrequent contact with the imperial office.<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 11(3)2.4, 8.1, 11.3&ndash;4, 12.2; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8, 288; Potter, 285, 650.</ref> The emperors would not meet again until 303.<ref>Potter, 285.</ref>

Following Maximian's failure to invade in 289, an uneasy truce with Carausius began. Maximian tolerated Carausius' rule in Britain and on the continent but refused to grant the secessionist state formal legitimacy. For his part, Carausius was content with his territories beyond the Continental coast of Gaul.<ref>Williams, 55&ndash;56, 62.</ref> However, Diocletian would not long put up with such an affront to his dignity. Faced with Carausius' secession and further challenges on the Egyptian, Syrian, and Danubian borders, he realized that two emperors were insufficient to manage the empire.<ref>Williams, 62&ndash;64.</ref> On [[March 1]] [[293]] at Milan, Maximian appointed Constantius to the office of Caesar.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8&ndash;9; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 4, 36&ndash;37; Potter, 288; Southern, 146; Williams, 64&ndash;65.</ref> On either the same day or a month later, Diocletian did the same for [[Galerius]], thus establishing the "Tetrarchy", or "rule of four".<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8&ndash;9; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 4, 38; Potter, 288; Southern, 146; Williams, 64&ndash;65.</ref> Constantius was made to understand that he must succeed where Maximian had failed and defeat Carausius.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8, 15; Williams, 71.</ref>

===Campaign against Allectus===
[[Image:Quinarius Allectus galley-RIC 0128.2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Allectus]], Carausius' successor]]
Constantius met expectations quickly and efficiently, and by 293 had expelled Carausian forces from northern Gaul. In the same year, 
Casausius was assassinated and replaced by his treasurer, [[Allectus]].<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 15; Potter, 288; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 99; Southern, 149&ndash;50; Williams, 71&ndash;72.</ref> Constantius marched up the coast to the Rhine and Scheldt estuaries where he was victorious over Carausius' Frankish allies, taking the title ''Germanicus maximus''.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 15&ndash;16; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 255.</ref> His sights now set on Britain, Constantius spent the following years building an invasion fleet.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 15&ndash;16; Southern, 150.</ref> Maximian, still in Italy after the appointment of Constantius, was appraised of the invasion plans and, in the summer of 296, returned to Gaul.<ref>Barnes, ''New Empire'', 58&ndash;59.</ref> There, he held the Rhenish frontiers against Carausius' Frankish allies while Constantius launched his invasion of Britain.<ref>Barnes, ''New Empire'', 59; Southern, 150; Williams, 73.</ref> Allectus was killed on the [[North Downs]] in battle with Constantius' praetorian prefect, [[Julius Asclepiodotus|Asclepiodotus]]. Constantius himself had landed near [[Dubris]] (Dover) and marched on [[Roman London|Londinium]] ([[London]]), whose citizens greeted him as a liberator.<ref>Southern, 150; Williams, 73&ndash;74; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 16.</ref>

==Campaigns in North Africa==
With Constantius' victorious return, Maximian was able to focus on the conflict in [[Mauretania]] ([[Northwest Africa]]).<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 16; Southern, 150; Williams, 75.</ref> As Roman authority weakened during the third century, nomadic [[Berber]] tribes harassed settlements in the region with increasingly severe consequences. In 289, the governor of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]] (roughly modern [[Algeria]]) gained a temporary respite by pitting a small army against the Bavares and [[Quinquegentiani]], but the raiders soon returned. In 296, Maximian raised an army, from [[Praetorian Guard|Praetorian cohorts]], [[Aquileia]]n, Egyptian, and Danubian legionaries, Gallic and German [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]], and [[Thrace|Thracian]] recruits, advancing through Spain that autumn.<ref name="W75">Williams, 75.</ref><ref>Barnes, ''New Empire'', 59.</ref> He may have defended the region against raiding [[Moors]]<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 16.</ref> before crossing the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] into [[Mauretania Tingitana]] (roughly modern [[Morocco]]) to protect the area from Frankish pirates.<ref name="W75"/>

By March 297, Maximian had begun a bloody offensive against the Berbers. The campaign was lengthy, and Maximian spent the winter of 297&ndash;298 resting in [[Carthage]] before returning to the field.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 16; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 59.</ref> Not content to drive them back into their homelands in the [[Atlas Mountains]] &ndash; from which they could continue to wage war &ndash; Maximian ventured deep into Berber territory. The terrain was unfavorable, and the Berbers were skilled at [[guerrilla warfare]], but Maximian pressed on. Apparently wishing to inflict as much punishment as possible on the tribes, he devastated previously secure land, killed as many as he could, and drove the remainder back into the [[Sahara]].<ref name="W75"/> His campaign was concluded by the spring of 298 and, on [[March 10]], he made a triumphal entry into Carthage.<ref>Barnes, ''New Empire'', 59; Williams, 75.</ref> Inscriptions there record the people's gratitude to Maximian, hailing him &ndash; as Constantius had been on his entry to London &ndash; as ''redditor lucis aeternae'' ("restorer of the eternal light").<ref name="W75"/> Maximian returned to Italy in 299 to celebrate another triumph in Rome.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 16; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 59.</ref>

==Leisure and retirement==
After his Mauretanian campaign, Maximian returned to the north of Italy, living a life of leisure in palaces in Milan and Aquilea, and leaving warfare to his subordinate Constantius.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 16; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 56.</ref> Maximian was more aggressive in his relationship with the Senate than Constantius, and Lactantius contends that he terrorized senators, to the point of falsely charging and subsequently executing several, including the prefect of Rome in 301/2.<ref>Lactantius, ''DMP'' 8.4; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 16.</ref> In contrast, Constantius kept up good relations with the senatorial aristocracy and spent his time in active defense of the empire. He took up arms against the Franks in 300 or 301 and in 302 &ndash; while Maximian was resting in Italy &ndash; continued to campaign against Germanic tribes on the Upper Rhine.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 16.</ref>

Maximian was only disturbed from his rest in 303 by Diocletian's ''vicennalia'', the 20-year anniversary of his reign, in Rome. Some evidence suggests that it was on then that Diocletian exacted a promise from Maximian to retire together, passing their titles as Augusti to the Caesars Constantius and Galerius.<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 7(6)15.16; Lactantius ''DMP'' 20.4; Potter, 340; Southern, 152, 336.</ref> Presumably Maximian's son Maxentius and Constantius' son Constantine &ndash; children raised in Nicomedia together &ndash; would then become the new Caesars. While Maximian might not have wished to retire, Diocletian was still in control and there was little resistance. Before retirement, Maximian would receive one final moment of glory by officiating at the [[Secular Games]] in 304.<ref>Potter, 340.</ref>

On [[May 1]], [[305]], in separate ceremonies in Milan and Nicomedia, Diocletian and Maximian retired simultaneously. The succession did not go not entirely to Maximian's liking: perhaps because of Galerius' influence, [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] and [[Maximinus]] were appointed Caesar, thus excluding Maxentius. Both the newly appointed Caesars had had long military careers and were close to Galerius: Severus was his nephew and Maximinus a former army comrade.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25&ndash;27; Williams, 191.</ref> Maximian quickly soured to the new tetrarchy, which saw Galerius assume the dominant position Diocletian once held.  Although Maximian led the ceremony that proclaimed Severus Caesar, within two years he was sufficiently dissatisfied to support his son's rebellion against the new regime.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25&ndash;27; Potter, 341&ndash;42.</ref> Diocletian retired to the expansive [[Diocletian's Palace|palace]] he had built in his homeland, Dalmatia near Salona on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]. Maximian retired to villas in [[Campania]] or [[Lucania]], where he lived a life of ease and luxury.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27; Southern, 152.</ref> Although far from the political centers of the empire, Diocletian and Maximian remained close enough to stay in regular contact.<ref>Southern, 152.</ref>

==Maxentius' rebellion==
After the death of Constantius on [[July 25]] [[306]], Constantine assumed the title of Augustus. This displeased Galerius, who instead offered Constantine the title of Caesar, which Constantine accepted. The title of Augustus then went to Severus.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27<U+2013>28; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 5; Lenski, 61<U+2013>62; Odahl, 78<U+2013>79.</ref> Maxentius was jealous of Constantine's power, and on [[October 28]] [[306]], he persuaded a cohort of imperial guardsmen to declare him emperor. Uncomfortable with sole leadership, Maxentius sent a set of imperial robes to Maximian and saluted him as "Augustus for the second time", offering him theoretic equal rule but less actual power and a lower rank.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 30<U+2013>32.</ref> 

Galerius refused to recognize Maxentius and sent Severus with an army to Rome to depose him. As many of Severus' soldiers had served under Maximian, and had taken Maxentius' bribes, most of the army defected to Maxentius. Severus fled to [[Ravenna]], which Maximian besieged. The city was strongly fortified so Maximian offered terms, which Severus accepted. Maximian then seized Severus and took him under guard to a public villa in southern Rome, where he was kept as a hostage. In the autumn of 307, Galerius led a second force against Maxentius but he again failed to take Rome, and retreated north with his army mostly intact.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 30&ndash;31; Elliott, 41&ndash;42; Lenski, 62&ndash;63; Odahl, 86&ndash;87; Potter, 348&ndash;49.</ref>

[[Image:Maxentius02 pushkin.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Dresden bust of Maxentius]]
While Maxentius built up Rome's defenses, Maximian made his way to Gaul to negotiate with Constantine. A deal was struck in which Contantine would marry Maximian's younger daughter [[Fausta]] and be elevated to Augustan rank in Maxentius' secessionist regime.  In return, Constantine would reaffirm the old family alliance between Maximian and Constantius, and support Maxentius' cause in Italy but would remain neutral in the war with Galerius. The deal was sealed with a double ceremony in Trier in the late summer of 307, at which Constantine married Fausta and was declared Augustus by Maximian.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 31; Lenski, 64; Odahl, 87&ndash;88; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15&ndash;16.</ref><!-- Recasting may might require redistribution of refs.--> 

Maximian returned to Rome in the winter of 307&ndash;8 but soon fell out with his son and in the spring of 308 challenged his right to rule before an assembly of Roman soldiers. He spoke of Rome's sickly government, disparaged Maxentius for having weakened it, and ripped the imperial toga from Maxentius' shoulders. He expected the soldiers to recognize him but they sided with Maxentius, and Maximian was forced to leave Italy in disgrace.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 32; Lenski, 64; Odahl, 89, 93.</ref>

On [[November 11]] [[308]], to resolve the political instability, Galerius called Diocletian (out of retirement) and Maximian to a general council meeting at the military city of [[Carnuntum]] on the upper Danube. There, Maximian was forced again to abdicate again and Constantine was again demoted to Caesar. [[Licinius]], a loyal military companion to Galerius, was appointed Augustus of the West.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 32&ndash;34; Elliott, 42&ndash;43; Lenski, 65; Odahl, 90&ndash;91; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 17; Potter, 349&ndash;50; Treadgold, 29.</ref> In early 309 Maximian returned to the court of Constantine in Gaul, the only court that would still accept him.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 32.</ref>

==Rebellion against Constantine==
In 310, Maximian rebelled against Constantine while the emperor was on campaign against the Franks. Maximian had been sent south to Arles with part of Constantine's army to defend against attacks by Maxentius in southern Gaul. In Arles, Maximian announced that Constantine was dead and took up the [[Tyrian purple|imperial purple]]. In spite offering bribes to any who would support him as emperor, most of Constantine's army remained loyal, and Maximian was compelled to leave. Constantine soon heard of the rebellion, abandoned his campaign against the Franks, and moved quickly to southern Gaul, where he confronted the fleeing Maximian at Massilia ([[Marseille]]). The town was better able to withstand a long siege than Arles, but it made little difference as loyal citizens opened the rear gates to Constantine. Maximian was captured, reproved for his crimes, and stripped of his title for the third and last time. Constantine granted Maximian some clemency but strongly encouraged his suicide. In July 310, Maximian hanged himself.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 34&ndash;35; Elliott, 43; Lenski, 65&ndash;66; Odahl, 93; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 17; Potter, 352.</ref> 

Despite the earlier rupture in relations, after Maximian's suicide Maxentius presented himself as his father's devoted son.<ref>Elliott, 43; Lenski, 68; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 20.</ref> He minted coins bearing his father's deified image and proclaimed his desire to avenge his death.<ref>Barnes, ''New Empire'', 34; Elliott, 45; Lenski, 68.</ref>

Constantine initially presented the suicide as an unfortunate family tragedy. By 311, however, he was spreading another version. According to this, after Constantine had pardoned him, Maximian planned to murder Constantine in his sleep. Fausta learned of the plot and warned Constantine, who put a [[eunuch]] in his own place in bed. Maximian was apprehended when he killed the eunuch and was offered suicide, which he accepted.<ref>Lactantius, ''DMP'' 30.1; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 40&ndash;41, 305.</ref> In addition to the propaganda, Constantine instituted a ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' on Maximian, destroying all inscriptions referring to him and eliminating any public work bearing his image.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Lenski, 68.</ref>

Constantine defeated Maxentius at the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] on [[October 28]] [[312]]. Maxentius died, and Italy came under Constantine's rule.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 42&ndash;44.</ref> Eutropia swore on oath that Maxentius was not Maximian's son, and Maximian's memory was rehabilitated. His [[apotheosis]] under Maxentius was declared null and void, and he was re-consecrated as a god, probably in 317. He began appearing on Constantine's coinage as ''divus'', or divine, by 318, together with the deified Constantius and [[Claudius II|Claudius Gothicus]].<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 47; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 35.</ref> The three were hailed as Constantine's forbears. They were called "the best of emperors".<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 47.</ref> Through his daughters Fausta and Flavia, Maximian was grandfather or great-grandfather to every reigning emperor from 337 to 363.<ref>Barnes, ''New Empire'', 265&ndash;66.</ref>
