'''''Doomsday''''' is a 2008 British science fiction film written and directed by [[Neil Marshall]]. The film takes place in the future. [[Scotland]] has been quarantined because of a deadly virus. When the virus is found in [[London]], political leaders send a team led by Major Eden Sinclair ([[Rhona Mitra]]) to Scotland to find a possible cure.  Sinclair's team runs into two types of  survivors: marauders and medieval knights. ''Doomsday'' was conceived by Marshall based on the idea of futuristic soldiers facing medieval knights.  In producing the film, he drew from various cinema, including ''[[Mad Max]]'' and ''[[Escape from New York]]''.

Marshall had a budget three times the size of his previous two films, ''[[The Descent]]'' and ''[[Dog Soldiers (film)|Dog Soldiers]]'', and the director filmed the larger-scale ''Doomsday'' in Scotland and [[South Africa]]. The film was released on 14 March 2008 in the United States and Canada and in the United Kingdom on 9 May 2008.  ''Doomsday'' did not perform well at the box office, and critics gave the film mixed reviews.

== Plot ==
In 2008, the Reaper virus infects Scotland, so the country is walled off by the British government. A Scottish woman begs retreating soldiers to take her injured little girl with them. Her daughter has an eye injury but is healthy otherwise. The mother gives her daughter an envelope just as the soldiers' helicopter lifts off. 

The quarantine is deemed a success, with the remaining Scottish population and the virus apparently dying off. Decades later, though, the virus reappears in London. Prime Minister Hatcher and his righthand man Canaris share with domestic security chief Bill Nelson news of survivors in Scotland, and they believe a cure may exist. They order him to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr Kane, who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses Major Eden Sinclair, the little girl now grown up, to lead the team. She has a cybernetic eye that can be removed and used remotely for weapon aiming and video playback.

North of the wall, while searching for any survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a gang. Some team members are killed, while Sinclair and Dr Talbot are captured. Sergeant Norton and Dr Stirling manage to escape the attack. Sinclair is interrogated and tortured by the gang's leader, Sol. Dr Talbot is barbecued alive and eaten by the cannibalistic gang. During the "feast", Sinclair escapes from her cell and discovers Kane's daughter, Cally, in the next cell. Freed by Sinclair, Cally leads her to a waiting train manned by her friend Joshua, while Norton and Stirling meet up with them while they escape. They take the train into the mountains and take a shortcut through a hidden underground military facility, to the castle where Kane and his followers live. They are surrounded by Kane's medieval soldiers, Joshua is killed, and everyone else surrenders. Kane tells Sinclair that the survivors are naturally immune and that he has been warring with Sol, who is actually his son. There is no cure. Sinclair defeats Kane's executioner, Telamon, in an open arena and her teammates help her escape. They retreat to the underground facility and find a Bentley in storage to drive back to the quarantine wall and home, although Norton is killed covering their escape.

In London, political leaders plan to seal off the "hot spot" where the virus is spreading. Canaris convinces Hatcher to let the infected die off before sharing any cure found by Sinclair's team. That way the population would be controllable if there is a future infection. Although the government leaders are isolated, an infected man gets past security and infects Hatcher. Knowing that he has no future, Hatcher commits suicide and Canaris takes over as Acting Prime Minister. 

In Scotland, Sinclair, Cally, and Stirling are in a high speed car chase with Sol's gang. Sol attempts to hijack the Bentley, but while he is clinging to the roof Sinclair ploughs the car through a bus, decapitating him. Using a satellite phone, Sinclair calls in a government gunship and hands over the cure: Cally, whose immune blood can be replicated into a vaccine. Canaris, who came with the gunship, shares his plan to withhold the cure for political reasons and invites Sinclair back to London. 

She chooses to stay and goes to find her old home, using the address on the old envelope her mother had left her. Nelson meets her there since she gave him the envelope before she left. Sinclair shows Nelson the video of her conversation with Canaris, recorded with her cybernetic eye. Nelson takes it back to London and has it aired, exposing Canaris' plan to hold back the cure.  Sinclair returns to the location where she and her team were first attacked by Sol's gang and holds up Sol's severed head. She is cheered as their new leader.

== Production ==
=== Conception ===
Director [[Neil Marshall]] lived near the ruins of [[Hadrian's Wall]], a Roman fortification built to defend England against Scotland's tribes. The director fantasised about what conditions would make the Wall to be rebuilt and imagined a lethal virus would work. Marshall had also visualised a mixture of medieval and futuristic elements: "I had this vision of these futuristic soldiers with high-tech weaponry and body armour and helmets<U+2014>clearly from the future<U+2014>facing a medieval knight on horseback." The director favoured the English/Scottish border as the location for a rebuilt wall, finding the location more plausible than a lengthy boundary between the United States and Canada. Additionally, Scotland was the home to multiple castles, which fit Marshall's medieval aspect.<ref name=cfq>{{cite news | first=Steve | last=Biodrowski | url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/03/07/interview-neil-marshall-directs-doomsday | title=Interview: Neil Marshall Directs "Doomsday" | work=Cinefantastique.com | publisher=[[Cinefantastique]] | date=2008-03-07 | accessdate=2008-03-15 }}</ref>

The lethal virus in ''Doomsday'' differs from contemporary films like ''[[28 Days Later]]'' and ''[[28 Weeks Later]]'' by being an authentic plague that actually decimates the population, instead of infecting people so they become aggressive cannibals or zombies. Marshall intended the virus as the backdrop to the story, having survivors scavenge for themselves and set up a primitive society. The director drew from tribal history around the world to design the society. Though the survivors are depicted as brutal, Marshall sought to have "shades of gray" by characterising some people in England as selfishly manipulative.<ref name=cfq/>

The director intended ''Doomsday'' as a tribute to post-apocalyptic films from the 1970s and 1980s, explaining, "Right from the start, I wanted my film to be an homage to these sorts of movies, and deliberately so. I wanted to make a movie for a new generation of audience that hadn't seen those movies in the cinema<U+2014>hadn't seen them at all maybe<U+2014>and to give them the same thrill that I got from watching them. But kind of contemporise it, pump up the action and the blood and guts." Cinematic influences on ''Doomsday'' include:<ref name=picks>{{cite news | first=Rich | last=Cline | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/doomsday/news/1726180/ | title=Neil Marshall's 10 Post-Apocalyptic Picks | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc | date=2008-05-06 | accessdate=2008-05-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080524080452/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/doomsday/ |archivedate = May 24, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

*''[[Mad Max]]'' (1979), ''[[Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior|The Road Warrior]]'' (1981), and ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'' (1985): Marshall drew inspiration from the punk style of the films and also shaped Rhona Mitra's character after [[Max Rockatansky]] as a police officer with a history.<ref name=picks/>
*''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981): The director drew from the concepts of gang warfare and the experience of being walled-in.  Rhona Mitra's character has an eye patch like [[Snake Plissken]], though the director sought to create a plot point for the eye of Mitra's character to reinforce its inclusion.<ref name=picks/>

*''[[No Blade of Grass (film)|No Blade of Grass]]'' (1970): Marshall perceived the film as a predecessor to ''28 Days Later'' and ''28 Weeks Later'', though he sought to make ''Doomsday'' less straight-faced.<ref name=picks/>
*''[[The Omega Man]]'' (1971): The director was inspired by the "empty city" notion of the film and drew upon its dark and gritty nature.<ref name=picks/>
*''[[A Boy and His Dog]]'' (1974): Marshall created a homage to the 1974 film's ending by including a scene of a human being cooked in ''Doomsday''.<ref name=picks/>

*''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' (2000): Like in ''Gladiator'', Marshall sought to put Mitra's character through a trial by combat.<ref name=picks/>
*''[[Children of Men]]'' (2006): With the film coming out during the development of ''Doomsday'', the director realised the similarity of the premises and sought to make his film "more bloody and more fun".<ref name=picks/>

A massive car chase scene was filmed for ''Doomsday'', described by Marshall to be one part ''Mad Max'', one part ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968), and one part "something else entirely different".<ref name=first>{{cite news | first=Alex | last=Billington | url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/07/28/neil-marshalls-doomsday-trailer-debut-at-comic-con-posters/ | title=Neil Marshall's Doomsday Trailer Debut at Comic-Con + Posters | work=FirstShowing.net | publisher=First Showing, LLC | date=2007-07-28 | accessdate=2007-07-30 }}</ref> Marshall had seen the [[Aston Martin DBS V12]] used in the James Bond film ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006) and sought to implement a similarly "sexy" car.

=== Visual effects ===
[[File:Doomsday Bentley.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=A black car flies through the air out of the side of a graffiti-covered bus that is exploding.|The Bentley was filmed crashing through the bus without use of pyrotechnics due to fire hazards, and visual effects were later added to show the explosion.]]
The visual effects for ''Doomsday'' stemmed from the 1980s stunt-based films, involving approximately 275 visual effects shots.  While filmmakers did not seek innovative visual effects, they worked with budget restrictions by creating set extensions.  With most shots taking place in daylight, the extensions involved matte paint and 2D and 3D solutions.  The visual effects crew visited Scotland to take reference photos so scenes that were filmed in Cape Town, South Africa could instead have Scottish backgrounds.  Several challenges for the visual effects crew included the illustration of cow overpopulation in line with a decimated human population and the convincing creation of the rebuilt Hadrian Wall in different lights and from different distances.  The most challenging visual effects shot in ''Doomsday'' was the close-up in which a main character is burned alive.  The shot required multiple enhancements and implementations of burning wardrobe, burning pigskin, and smoke and fire elements to look authentic.<ref name=vfxworld>{{cite news | first=Thomas J. | last=McLean | url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&format=rss&id=3578 | title=''Doomsday'': A VFX Cure for the Reaper Virus | work=VFXWorld.com | publisher=AWN, Inc | date=2008-03-14 | accessdate=2008-05-20 }}</ref>

Neil Marshall's car chase sequence also involved the use of visual effects.  A scene in which the Bentley crashes through a bus was intended to implement pyrotechnics, but fire marshals in the South African nature reserve, the filming location for the scene, forbade their use due to dry conditions.  A miniature mock-up was created and visual effects were applied so the filming of the mock-up would overlay the filming of the actual scene without pyrotechnics.  Other visual effects that were created were the Thames flood plain and a remote Scottish castle. A popular effect with the visual effects crew was the "rabbit explosion" scene, depicting a rabbit being shot by guns on automatic sensors.  The crew sought to expand the singular shot, but Neil Marshall sought to focus on one shot to emphasize its comic nature and avoid drawing unnecessary sympathy from audiences.<ref name=vfxworld/>

=== Music ===
Marshall originally intended to include 1980s [[synthesizer|synth]] music in his film, but he found it difficult to combine the music with the intense action. Instead, composer [[Tyler Bates]] composed a score using heavy orchestra music.<ref name=sayer/> The film also included songs from the bands [[Adam and the Ants]], [[Fine Young Cannibals]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]], and [[Kasabian]].<ref name=credits/>  The song "[[Two Tribes]]" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood was the only song to remain in the film from the first draft of the screenplay. "[[Spellbound (Siouxsie and the Banshees song)|Spellbound]]" by Siouxsie and the Banshees was a favorite song by the director, who sought to include it.  Marshall also hoped to include the song "Into the Light" by the Banshees, but it was left out due to the producer disliking it and the cost being too high to license it.<ref>{{cite news | first=Tim | last=Masters | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7390688.stm | title= Talking Shop: Neil Marshall | work=[[BBC News Online]] | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=2008-05-09 | accessdate=2008-05-20 }}</ref>

Rowat said, "In his previous films, Marshall made something out of nothing. Here he does the opposite."  The critic acknowledged the attempted homages and the B-movie approach but thought that "there has to be something more".<ref>{{cite news | first=Alison | last=Rowat | title=A hackneyed horror hits the wall Seeing Glasgow on the big screen is Doomsday's only thrill | url= http://www.theherald.co.uk/goingout/top/display.var.2254790.0.A_hackneyed_horror_hits_the_wall.php| work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] | publisher=[[Newsquest]] | date=2008-05-08|accessdate= 2008-08-02 }}</ref>  Steve Pratt of ''[[The Northern Echo]]'' weighed in, "As a writer, Marshall leaves gaping holes in the plot while as a director he knows how to extract maximum punch from car chases, beatings and fights without stinting on the gore as body parts are lopped off with alarming frequency and bodies squashed to a bloody pulp."<ref>{{cite news | first=Steve | last=Pratt | title=Enjoyable doom and gloom | work=[[The Northern Echo]] | publisher=[[Newsquest]] | date=2008-05-08 }}</ref>  Philip Key of the ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]'' described the film, "''Doomsday'' is a badly thought-out science fiction saga which leaves more questions than answers."<ref>{{cite news | first=Philip | last=Key | title=Doomed to fail | url= http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-life-features/liverpool-arts/2008/05/09/doomed-to-fail-64375-20883841/| work=[[Liverpool Daily Post]] | publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]] | date=2008-05-09 |accessdate= 2008-08-02}}</ref>

Alonso Duralde of [[MSNBC]] described ''Doomsday'': "It's ridiculous, derivative, confusingly edited and laden with gore, but it's the kind of over-the-top grindhouse epic that wears down your defenses and eventually makes you just go with it." Duralde believed that Mitra's character would have qualified as a "memorable fierce chick" if the film was not so silly.<ref>{{cite news | first=Alonso | last=Duralde | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23638065/ | title='Doomsday' is ridiculous and entertaining | work=[[MSNBC]] | publisher=[[NBC Universal]], [[Microsoft]] | date=2008-03-14 | accessdate=2008-03-14 }}</ref>  David Hiltbrand of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' rated ''Doomsday'' at 2.5 out of 4 stars and thought that the film was better paced than most fantasy-action films, patiently building up its action scenes to the major "fireworks" where other films would normally be exhausted early on.<ref>{{cite news | first=David | last=Hiltbrand | url=http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/movies/story/531782.html  | title=Doomsday | work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Holdings LLC]] | date=2008-03-13 | accessdate=2008-03-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080404201759/http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/movies/story/531782.html |archivedate = 2008-04-04}}</ref>

Reviewer [[James Berardinelli]] found the production of ''Doomsday'' to be a mess, complaining, "The action sequences might be more tense if they weren't obfuscated by rapid-fire editing, and the backstory is muddled and not all that interesting." Berardinelli also believed the attempted development of parallel storylines to be too much for the film, weakening the eventual payoff.<ref>{{cite news | first=James | last=Berardinelli | url=http://www.reelviews.net/movies/d/doomsday.html | title=Doomsday | work=ReelViews.net | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-03-15 }}</ref> Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said Neil Marshall's "flair for visceral action" made up for ''Doomsday'''s lack of originality and that the film barely had a dull moment. He added, "There's no question that ''Doomsday'' does what it does with vigor, high technical prowess and just enough humor to avoid turning ridiculous." Harvey considered the conclusion relatively weak, and found the quality of the acting satisfactory for the genre, while reserving praise for the "stellar" work of the stunt personnel.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Dennis | last=Harvey | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117936510.html | title=Doomsday Review | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] | date=2008-03-14 | accessdate=2008-03-15 }}</ref>  Peter Hartlaub of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' also praised the film's stunts, noting that it was reminiscent of "the beauty of the exploitation film era".  Hartlaub said of the effect, "Hire a couple of great stuntmen and a halfway sober cinematographer, and you didn't even need a screenwriter."<ref>{{cite news | first=Peter | last=Hartlaub | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/21/DDBM10P2FI.DTL |title=Stuntmen - accept no substitutes | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | publisher=[[Hearst Communications]] | date=2008-05-21 }}</ref>

Matt Zoller Seitz of ''[[The New York Times]]'' saw Rhona Mitra's character as a mere impersonation of [[Snake Plissken]] and considered the film's major supporting characters to be "lifeless". Seitz described his discontent over the lack of innovation in the director's attempted homages of older films: "''Doomsday'' is frenetic, loud, wildly imprecise and so derivative that it doesn<U+2019>t so much seem to reference its antecedents as try on their famous images like a child playing dress-up."<ref>{{cite news | first=Matt Zoller | last=Seitz | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/15/movies/15doom.html?bl&ex=1205726400&en=5a8aba53a3148fae&ei=5087%0A | title=Confronting a Killer Epidemic That Wouldn't Die | work=[[The New York Times]] | publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] | date=2008-03-15 | accessdate=2008-03-15 }}</ref>

=== Scottish reception ===
Scotland's tourism agency [[VisitScotland]] welcomed ''Doomsday'', hoping that the film would attract tourism by marketing Scotland to the rest of the world.  The country's national body for film and television, [[Scottish Screen]], had contributed <U+00A3>300,000 to the production of ''Doomsday'', which provided economic benefits for the cast and crew that dwelled in Scotland.  A spokesperson from Scottish Screen anticipated, "It's likely to also attract a big audience who will see the extent to which Scotland can provide a flexible and diverse backdrop to all genres of film."<ref name=cannibal>{{cite news | first=Thomas | last=Quinn | url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2276515,00.html | title=Cannibal tale set to boost tourist trade | work=[[The Guardian]] | publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] | date=2008-04-27 | accessdate=2008-04-28 }}</ref>

In contrast, several parties have expressed concern that ''Doomsday'' presents negativity in England's latent view of Scotland based on their history.  [[Angus MacNeil]], member of the [[Scottish National Party]], said of the film's impact: "The complimentary part is that people are thinking about Scotland as we are moving more and more towards independence. But the film depicts a country that is still the plaything of London. It is decisions made in London that has led to it becoming a quarantine zone."<ref name=cannibal/>

''Doomsday'' was not nominated nor considered as a possible contender at the [[BAFTA Scotland]] awards despite being one of the largest productions in Scotland in recent memory; {{nowrap|<U+00A3>2 million}} was spent on local services.  Director Neil Marshall applied for membership with the organisation to add "fresh blood", but ''Doomsday'' was not mentioned during jury deliberations.  According to a spokesperson from the organisation, the film was not formally submitted for consideration, and no one directly invited the filmmakers to discuss a possible entry.  Several of BAFTA Scotland's jury members believed that the criteria and procedures for a Scottish film were unclear and could have been more formalised.<ref>{{cite news | last=Pendreigh | first=Brian | url=http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.2461513.0.filmed_in_scotland_loved_by_fans_snubbed_by_bafta.php | title=Filmed in Scotland, loved by fans ... snubbed by BAFTA | work=[[Sunday Herald]] | date=18&nbsp;October 2008 | accessdate=18&nbsp;November 2008 }}</ref>

IGN called the commentary "a pretty straight-up behind-the-scenes take on the movie and a bit over-congratulatory".
