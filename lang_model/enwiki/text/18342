'''Kurt Werth''' (September 21, 1896- August 25, 1983) was a German born illustrator of children<U+2019>s books.

Werth was born September 21, 1896 in [[Leipzig, Germany]].  He studied at the [[State Academy for the Graphic Arts]] in Leipzig beginning in 1913.  He studied there for two years before being drafted into the German army.  After his two years of service he returned to the Academy.  His professor was influenced by [[Cezanne]], although the public wasn't yet aware of the new trend of cubism in art. At the Academy, Werth studied the new graphic techniques and tried them out as illustrations of literary works. After graduating, Werth began to illustrate books, the first being Shakespeare's [[Troilus and Cressida]] which was well-received. <ref>[http://www.lib.usm.edu/~degrum/html/research/findaids/werth.htm USM de Grummond Collection - KURT WERTH PAPERS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Werth moved to [[Munich|Munich, Germany]] after graduating, to draw satirical cartoons for various Munich magazines.  In 1928, he and his wife Margaret, a Jewish German, moved to [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany]] so that she could become part of the City Theater. In Berlin, Werth continued to draw satirical cartoons for Berlin magazines. 

With [[Hitler]]'s increasing power, the magazines folded, and Margaret Werth, who was Jewish, was not allowed to work. In the 1939 the Werths immigrated to the United States where Werth found employment illustrating a Sunday column in the [[New York Times magazine]].<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://nwda-db.wsulibs.wsu.edu/findaid/ark:/80444/xv63283 Guide to the Kurt Werth Papers 1896-1983<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Werth began drawing political cartoons for a wide number of U.S. magazines with a political bent once the U.S. became involved in [[World War II]].  After the war Werth began to illustrate children<U+2019>s books.  One of his first attempts was [[Rosalys Hall]]'s ''The Merry Miller.''  This attempt lead to many other offers for illustrating work.  

Werth became a United States citizen in 1947.<ref>http://special.lib.umn.edu/findaid/xml/CLRC-1716.xml</ref>

Werth states, "As a German I was certainly influenced by the tradition of exact and thorough training in drawing. This goes back to Durer and even farther." He attempts to illustrate children's books in a "modern style." "Books have to be illustrated in our times. They should show the style of our times. Not all of them do it." <ref name=autogenerated1 />

Kurt Werth died in [[New York City]] on August 25, 1983.
