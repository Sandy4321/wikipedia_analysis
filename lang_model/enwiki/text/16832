"'''There's No Place Like Home, Parts 1, 2 & 3'''" is the [[season finale]] of the [[American Broadcasting Company]]'s [[Lost (season 4)|fourth season]] of the [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]] [[Dramatic programming|drama]] [[Television program|television series]] ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', consisting of the 12th through 14th [[List of Lost episodes|episodes]]. They are also the 84th through 86th episodes of the show overall. The three constituent episodes were split into two broadcasts; "Part 1" first aired on May 15, 2008 and "Part 2", serving as the two-hour season finale of the fourth season, first aired on May 29, 2008 on ABC in the United States and on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] in Canada.<ref name=PR1>{{cite web|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Medianet|date=2008-04-14|url=http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=041408_22|title= ABC Announces Special Two-Hour Finales of "Grey's Anatomy" and "Lost"|accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> The episodes were written by executive producers/[[show runner]]s [[Carlton Cuse]] and [[Damon Lindelof]]; "Part 1" was directed by co-executive producer [[Stephen Williams (director)|Stephen Williams]], while executive producer [[Jack Bender]] directed "Part 2".<ref name=PR2>{{cite web|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Medianet|date=2008-05-12|url=http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=051208_14|title= As the Face-Off Between the Survivors and Freighter People Continues, the Oceanic Six Find Themselves Closer to Rescue|accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref>{{ref label|note01|A|^}} The title is a reference to ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.

The narrative takes place in late December 2004, 100 days after the crash of Oceanic Flight 815. The survivors of the crash team up with the [[Others (Lost)|Others]], natives of the island where the plane crashed, to confront the mercenaries from the freighter ''Kahana'', who have come to the island. Following this, some of the survivors escape the island and [[Ben Linus]] ([[Michael Emerson]]) moves the island. Flashforwards show the first actions of the [[Oceanic Six]], those who are rescued, after returning home in January 2005, and their lives in late 2007. The cliffhanger from the previous season finale, "[[Through the Looking Glass (Lost)|Through the Looking Glass]]," is resolved by revealing [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]] ([[Terry O'Quinn]]) to be dead and in the coffin that [[Jack Shephard]] ([[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]]) visits in that episode.

Production and broadcast of the fourth season were interrupted by the [[2007<U+2013>2008 Writers Guild of America strike]] and following its resolution, the writers were unable to compress the remainder of season four into the five allotted episodes and the season finale was extended by one hour. Subsequently, the production schedule was compressed and post-production work was completed in three weeks, instead of the usual two months.

The second part was watched by 12 million Americans, making ''Lost'' the most watched show of the week, for the first time in the show's history.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Medianet|date=2008-06-03|url=http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=060308_05|title= Primetime Ratings Report|accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref> Both parts were met with critical acclaim. Matthew Fox's acting in his flashforward scenes was praised, as was [[Michael Giacchino]]'s musical score. The latter part of the episode was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for editing, but did not win.

==Plot==
===Part 1===
In flashforwards to January 2005, the Oceanic Six<U+2014>Jack Shephard, [[Kate Austen]] ([[Evangeline Lilly]]), [[Sayid Jarrah]] ([[Naveen Andrews]]), [[Sun-Hwa Kwon]] ([[Yunjin Kim]]), [[Hugo "Hurley" Reyes]] ([[Jorge Garcia]]) and [[Claire Littleton]]'s ([[Emilie de Ravin]]) infant, [[Characters of Lost#Oceanic Six|Aaron]]<U+2014>arrive in [[Honolulu]], where Hurley and Sun are reunited with their parents; Jack with his mother; and Sayid with his girlfriend, [[Characters of Lost#Minor recurring off-island characters|Nadia Jaseem]] ([[Andrea Gabriel]]). In the ensuing [[media circus]], a [[press conference]] is held, where they lie about everything that has happened on the island, going as far as saying that they are the only living survivors of the plane crash. Sometime later, Hurley's dad ([[Cheech Marin]]) gives Hurley his newly rebuilt 1970s [[Camaro]], at a surprise birthday party. Hurley, however, becomes panicked and runs away when he notices that the car's [[odometer]] displays [[Mythology of Lost#The Numbers|the Numbers]]. In [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], Sun visits her father and informs him that she used the money from her [[settlement (litigation)|settlement]] with [[Oceanic Airlines]] to buy a controlling interest in his company because she blames him for her husband's, [[Jin-Soo Kwon]] ([[Daniel Dae Kim]]), death. In the final flashforward, Jack eulogizes his deceased father, [[Christian Shephard]] ([[John Terry (actor)|John Terry]]). After the ceremony, [[Characters_of_Lost#Other_recurring_off-island_characters|Carole Littleton]] (Susan Duerden), Claire's mother, reveals to him that Claire is his [[Sibling#Half_sibling|half-sister]].<ref name=tnplh1>[[Damon Lindelof|Lindelof, Damon]] (writer) & [[Carlton Cuse|Cuse, Carlton]] (writer) & [[Stephen Williams (director)|Williams, Stephen]] (director).

On December 30, 2004, following the events of "[[Cabin Fever (Lost)|Cabin Fever]]", Jack and Kate follow the tracking signal on the phone given to them by [[Characters of Lost#Other Kahana crew members|Frank Lapidus]] ([[Jeff Fahey]]), who dropped it onto the survivors' beach from a helicopter. They encounter [[James "Sawyer" Ford]] ([[Josh Holloway]]), Aaron and [[Miles Straume]] ([[Ken Leung]]); Kate returns to the beach with Miles and Aaron. Jack and Sawyer meet up with Lapidus at the helicopter, but decide to rescue Hurley, who is with Ben, the mercenaries' target, before leaving for the freighter. Meanwhile, Sayid arrives at the beach on the freighter's [[Zodiac Group|Zodiac]] boat and informs the survivors that they must go to the freighter as soon as possible because the mercenaries' secondary objective is to kill everyone on the island. He and Kate go after Jack and Sawyer, but are captured by [[Characters of Lost#The Others|Richard Alpert]] ([[Nestor Carbonell]]) and the rest of the Others.

Sun, Jin, and Aaron arrive at the boat, only to discover a bomb, consisting of a large amount of [[C-4 (explosive)|C4]] explosives, on board.<ref name=tnplh1/>

Meanwhile, in their quest to move the island, Ben, Locke and Hurley arrive at the [[Dharma Initiative#Station 6: The Orchid|Dharma Initiative Orchid station]], which is disguised as a greenhouse. Ben sends Locke to the real part of the station and surrenders himself to [[Martin Keamy]] ([[Kevin Durand]]) and the other mercenaries from the ''Kahana'', who had previously arrived. A final montage shows the Oceanic Six and Ben in their respective predicaments.<ref name=tnplh1/>

===Part 2===
On the island, Jack and Sawyer meet up with Hurley and Locke at the Orchid station. Jack and Locke once more argue about the nature of the island; Locke implores him to lie about the island once he and the other survivors leave. At the helicopter, Kate, Sayid, and the Others free Ben by ambushing and killing the mercenaries, except Keamy, who feigns death. In return, the Others allow Kate, Sayid and the other survivors to leave the island on the helicopter. Ben returns to the Orchid, where he gets in a hidden elevator with Locke.<ref name=tnplh2>[[Carlton Cuse|Cuse, Carlton]] (writer) & [[Damon Lindelof|Lindelof, Damon]] (writer) & [[Jack Bender|Bender, Jack]] (director).

Inside the underground part of the Orchid station, Ben puts every metal item he can find into a small compartment at the back of the room, while Locke watches the orientation video for the Orchid. On the tape, [[Characters of Lost#Dharma Initiative members|Pierre Chang]] ([[Fran<U+00E7>ois Chau]]) begins to discuss [[time travel]] involving "negatively charged [[exotic matter]]" when the [[VCR]] malfunctions and the tape rewinds itself. Shortly, Keamy arrives and tells Locke that if he (Keamy) dies, the C4 on the freighter will detonate, due to a remote trigger linked to a [[heart rate monitor]] he is wearing. Regardless, Ben kills Keamy with no remorse or sympathy for those on the boat, in order to avenge his adopted daughter [[Alex (Lost)|Alex]] ([[Tania Raymonde]]), whom Keamy executed. Ben seals and then activates power to the compartment he had loaded with metal items, blowing a hole in the back of it. Ben, now wearing a parka, tells Locke that whoever moves the island is forced to leave it and never come back; Ben must do it so that Locke can stay and lead the Others. Locke then goes to the Others, who welcome him home. Ben climbs through the hole and down a rocky tunnel beyond it into a frozen chamber, cutting his arm in the process.  He then turns a very large metal wheel. As he completes the rotation, an eerie sound and white-yellow light soon envelop the entire island. Ben disappears, only to reappear several months later in the [[Sahara Desert]] (as seen in "[[The Shape of Things to Come (Lost)|The Shape of Things to Come]]").<ref name=tnplh2/><ref>[[Brian K.

Jack, Kate, Sayid, Sawyer, Hurley, and Frank Lapidus leave the island on the helicopter, but discover a fuel leak on board. In order to lighten the helicopter, Sawyer jumps out after whispering something in Kate's ear and kissing her. The helicopter makes it to the ''Kahana'' in the nick of time; they refuel it, fix the leak, pick up [[Desmond Hume]] ([[Henry Ian Cusick]]), Sun and Aaron and leave seconds before the C4 detonates.

The status of Jin, who is still on the boat, is left uncertain as a [[cliffhanger]]. Sawyer swims back to the island and laments the destruction of the boat with [[Juliet Burke]] ([[Elizabeth Mitchell]]). The people on the helicopter decide to return to the island, but as they approach, they see the island vanish in the white-yellow light. With nowhere to land, the helicopter runs out of fuel and the survivors are forced to ditch into the ocean. They drift in a rescue raft for several hours, where Hurley suggests that Locke succeeded in moving the island, but Jack disagrees. At night, the survivors are rescued by [[Characters of Lost#Minor recurring off-island characters|Penny Widmore]] ([[Sonya Walger]]), Desmond's girlfriend, with whom he is finally reunited. Jack then convinces the other survivors that they must lie about their experiences on the island, to protect those left behind. In keeping with the faked wreckage of Flight 815 found in the [[Java Trench]], the Oceanic Six are dropped off near the island of [[Sumba]], where they are found by local villagers.<ref name=tnplh2/>

In flashforwards to late 2007, following those in "[[Through the Looking Glass (Lost)|Through the Looking Glass]]", Jack, Kate and [[Walt Lloyd]] ([[Malcolm David Kelley]]) all recount stories of being approached by Jeremy Bentham, the dead man in the coffin. Kate has a dream in which Claire tells her not to bring Aaron back to the island. In [[London]], [[England]], Sun confronts [[Charles Widmore]] ([[Alan Dale]]), Penny's father, who sent the ''Kahana'' to the island, and tells him that they have common interests involving the island. After finding out that Bentham is dead, Sayid breaks into the mental hospital where Hurley is staying and convinces him to go "somewhere safe". Jack returns to the funeral parlor, where he is confronted by Ben, who says that the island will not allow Jack to return without everyone else who left joining him. This includes Jeremy Bentham, who is finally revealed to be John Locke.<ref name=tnplh2/>

==Production==
===Cast===
[[File:Harold Perrineau, Jr.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This episode features the last appearance of Harold Perrineau as a main cast member.]]
The episode features the last appearance of actor Harold Perrineau, whose character Michael dies in an explosion, as a main cast member. The character of Michael was absent for the entire [[Lost (season 3)|third season]] of ''Lost'' and returned midway through the fourth season in "[[Ji Yeon]]." Perrineau was disappointed that he was brought back to the show only to be killed and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son, Walt, saying, "there are all these questions about how [the writers] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child. It plays into a really big, weird stereotype and, being a black person myself, that wasn't so interesting."<ref name=HPinterview/> The fate of Jin, who is also on the freighter when it explodes, is left uncertain. Actor Daniel Dae Kim was arrested for [[Driving under the influence|driving under the influence of alcohol]], which prompted speculation about his future on the series, due to co-stars [[Michelle Rodriguez]] ([[Ana Lucia Cortez|Ana-Lucia Cortez]]) and [[Cynthia Watros]] ([[Libby (Lost)|Libby]]) leaving ''Lost'' after DUI arrests.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2007/Oct/25/br/br5701984326.html|title='Lost' actor Daniel Dae Kim accused of DUI <U+2014> video|first=Dave|last=Dondoneau|publisher=The Honolulu Advertiser|accessdate=2008-03-20|date=2007-10-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/lost/lost-daniel-dae-kim-arrested-f-13016.aspx|title=Lost: Daniel Dae Kim Arrested for DUI|first=Oscar|last=Dahl|publisher=[[BuddyTV]]|date=2007-10-25|accessdate=2008-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=534ece8b-4d03-4477-b06b-73697236f98c|title=Lost Curse Strikes Again!

Kelley's character, Walt, was "benched" for the majority of the second and third seasons because the actor's growth was disproportionate to the amount of time that has passed on the island. The writers got the idea to show him in flashforwards in his older form while writing "Through the Looking Glass".<ref name=commentary>[[Carlton Cuse|Cuse, Carlton]] & [[Damon Lindelof|Lindelof, Damon]], "There's No Place Like Home, Part 2".

===Writing===
Throughout season four, Jack and Locke have argued about the true nature of the island, i.e. whether it has supernatural powers and whether Oceanic Flight 815 crashing is part of the survivors' destiny. Upon witnessing the island vanish at the end of this episode, Jack finally realizes that Locke was right.<ref name=commentary/> Jack then takes Locke's advice and convinces the other survivors that they must lie about the island once they are rescued. This is further emphasized by the fact that the same music is played during Jack and Locke's conversation and when the survivors encounter Penny's boat. Lindelof has also stated that Sawyer's message to Kate in the helicopter is a "critical plot point" in that it ultimately leads to the end of Jack and Kate's relationship once they return home (as seen in "[[Something Nice Back Home]]").<ref name=commentary/> In terms of plot structure, the main action scene of the episode, where the Others and the survivors confront the mercenaries, was deliberately placed at the beginning of "Part 2" so that the remainder of the episode could focus on character development. Furthermore, all of the present time plotlines are interconnected by the C4 bomb on the freighter, even though the writers themselves have called the use of the bomb as a plot device "ridiculous". It was necessary, however, in order to keep both Michael and Jin from leaving the freighter with the other survivors.<ref name=commentary/>

[[File:Lindelof y Cuse.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Writers Damon Lindelof (left) and Carlton Cuse (right) were unable to shorten the script and the finale was extended by an hour.]]
The final scenes of the episode, particularly Ben turning the wheel, Penny and Desmond's reunion and the last shot of Locke in the coffin were kept secret, in order to prevent spoilers from leaking. The phrase "Frozen Donkey Wheel" was coined to describe not only the wheel that Ben turns, but also the final scene in which Locke is shown to be in the coffin. Only six people knew that Locke was in the coffin<U+2014>actors Matthew Fox, Michael Emerson and Terry O'Quinn; writers Lindelof and Cuse and Jack Bender, the director.<ref name=commentary/>

After the resolution of the strike, Lindelof said that the effect of the strike on the fourth season would be minimal and the season's story arc would be completed as originally intended.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b4116_return_of_mother_life_oh_yeah_lost.html|title= The Return of ''Mother'', ''Life'' and, Oh Yeah, ''Lost''|author=[[Kristin Dos Santos|Dos Santos, Kristin]]|publisher=[[E!]] Online|date=February 13, 2008|accessdate=November 24, 2008}}</ref> However, the first draft of the second part of "There's No Place Like Home," was 85 pages long, approximately 30 pages longer than a typical one hour ''Lost'' script. Lindelof and Cuse found that they could not compress the second half of the season finale into one episode and actually wanted to expand it.

===Filming===
[[File:Tower_bridge_2_cz.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Scenes were filmed [[Filming location|on location]] in [[London]] near [[Tower Bridge]].]]
"There's No Place Like Home: Part 2" was filmed in approximately three and a half weeks; filming concluded three weeks before airing.<ref name=commentary/> Scenes set on the exterior of the freighter were shot on an actual freighter named ''Kahana''. Several actors and crew members stayed aboard the freighter while filming "There's No Place Like Home", as well as other episodes of the fourth season. Director Jack Bender and several others became [[seasickness|seasick]] after only spending a short time onboard. The helicopter featured in several scenes never actually took off from or landed on the ''Kahana'' because the rotors were too large and would hit the boat if used.<ref name=commentary/> Instead, the rotors were added using digital effects and the helicopter was raised and lowered by a crane onto the deck of the freighter while it was docked. Filming took place during this and the footage was intercut with scenes of Michael dealing with the bomb; thus the helicopter is never seen landing on the freighter.<ref>"Offshore Shoot".
