'''''All Guts, No Glory''''' is the fourth full-length album by [[death metal]] band [[Exhumed (band)|Exhumed]], and the first since their 2010 reformation.  [[Popmatters]] celebrated the album as capable of "reminding you why Exhumed were and will continue to be revered as the gods of gore-themed death metal."<ref name=Popmatters />

==Background==
In an interview conducted shortly after announcing that Exhumed would reform, founding member Matt Harvey remarked that "After a few years off and away from the death metal scene, I feel rejuvenated and ready to hack, maim and kill once again. I wanted this to be a continuation of what the band was doing and was on its way to doing, not a reunion or some weird nostalgia thing."<ref name=GSA>{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Chris|title=Exhumed Reform, Prepare To Crush Heads|url=http://gunshyassassin.com/news/exhumed-reform-prepare-to-crush-heads/|publisher=Gun Shy Assassin|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref> 

In 2010, the band recorded ''All Guts, No Glory''. The album line up was Matt Harvey on guitars and high vocals, Leon del Muerte on bass and low vocals, Wes Caley on guitar and Danny Walker on drums.  The musical approach taken on ''All Guts, No Glory'' was, according to Harvey, intentionally based on the band members' favoured elements of previous Exhumed records: "We all agreed that the period of Exhumed we liked the best was ''Slaughtercult'' and wanted to mix that with the technicality and melody of ''Anatomy''."<ref name=MU>{{cite web|last=Reviled|first=Joe|title=Gore Metal Gods Exhumed are Back from the Grave with a Reinvigorated Hunger for Blood and Guts Supremacy|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/interviews/details.cfm?newsid=70447|publisher=[http://www.metalunderground.com Metal Underground]|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref>

''All Guts, No Glory'' has been generally well-received, with most critics observing that the album has stepped away from the technicality of the previous studio album, ''Anatomy is Destiny.''  Allmusic wrote that "while not returning to the band's gore-grind demo era of yore, (''All Guts, No Glory'') is a more stripped-to-the-bone and go-straight-for-the-entrails outing than 2003's ''Anatomy Is Destiny''.<ref name=allmusic />  However, Metal Underground wrote that the album is not a simple return to the looser performance of ''Gore Metal'', noting that "the music is dense and overwhelming, but precise, revelling purely in the blood-soaked insanity."<ref name=MetalUndergound />
