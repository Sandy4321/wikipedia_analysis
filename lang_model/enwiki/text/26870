The '''Marble Collegiate Church''', founded in 1628, is one of the oldest continuous [[Protestant]] congregations in [[North America]]. The congregation, which  is part of the [[Reformed Church in America]], is now located at 272 [[Fifth Avenue]] at the corner of [[29th Street (Manhattan)|West 29th Street]] in the [[NoMad]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. It was built in 1851-54 and was designed by [[Samuel A. Warner]] in [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival style]] with [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic trim]]. The facade is covered in [[Tuckahoe marble]],<ref name=nycland>{{cite nycland}}, p.80</ref> for which the church, originally called the Fifth Avenue Church, was renamed in 1906.<ref name=fromatoz>{{cite fromatoz}}, p.140</ref>

The building was designated a [[List of New York City Landmarks|New York City landmark]] in 1967,<ref name=nycland /> and in 1980 was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The church congregation was founded in 1628 as the [[Middle Dutch Church (New York City)|Collegiate Reformed Protestant Dutch Church]] and was affiliated with the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], a [[Calvinist]] church in the [[Netherlands]]. During its first 150 years, Marble shared its ministers with the other Collegiate congregations as they developed in the city. This pooling of pastoral ministry was abandoned in 1871. The name "Collegiate" remains as part of the heritage of the four such churches in New York City today, and they participate in an administrative unit that oversees physical properties and investments held in common. The other congregations are [[New Middle Collegiate Church (New York City)|Middle Collegiate]], [[West End Collegiate Church|West End Collegiate]], and [[Middle Dutch Church (New York City)#1909 Fort Washington Church|Fort Washington Collegiate]].

Dr. [[Norman Vincent Peale]], the noted author of ''[[The Power of Positive Thinking]]'' served as senior minister from 1932-1984. Under his ministry Marble's influence reached national levels and became known as "America's Hometown Church." On November 19, 1961, [[Lucille Ball]] married her second husband [[Gary Morton]] in the church.<ref name="Pictures-28">{{cite book |title= Lucy: A Life in Pictures|last= Frew|first= Tim|year= 2001|format= Trade paperback|origyear=1996|edition= First paperback|publisher= [[Barnes & Noble|Barnes & Noble Books]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 0-7607-2866-6|pages=28<U+2013>29}}</ref> Following Peale's fifty-two year ministry, Dr. Arthur Caliandro served 25 years as the fifth senior minister of Marble Church. In all, he served 42 years on the pastoral staff. During Caliandro's tenure, MarbleVision, the media ministry of Marble Church was founded, its first woman minister was ordained, and the first women elders received. In addition, the church added its first new [[stained-glass window]] in almost 100 years. In 2009, Dr. Michael B. Brown, former pastor of Centenary [[United Methodist]] Church in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, succeeded Dr. Caliandro as senior minister.
