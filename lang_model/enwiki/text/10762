A leader of the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and of the [[Progressivism|Progressive Movement]], he was a [[List of Governors of New York|Governor of New York]] and a professional [[historian]], [[naturalist]], [[explorer]], [[author]], and [[soldier]]. He is most famous for his personality: his energy, his vast range of interests and achievements, his model of masculinity, and his "cowboy" persona. [[Teddy bear]]s are named after him.

As [[United States Department of the Navy|Assistant Secretary]] of the [[United States Navy|Navy]], Roosevelt prepared for and advocated war with [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in 1898. He organized and helped command the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry Regiment &mdash; the [[Rough Riders]] &mdash; during the [[Spanish-American War]]. Returning to New York as a war hero, he was elected governor. An avid writer, his 35 books include works on outdoor life, natural history, the [[American frontier]], political history, naval history, and his autobiography.<ref name="booklist">{{cite web |last = Gable Ph.D.|first = Dr. John Allen |authorlink = |coauthors = |year = |url = http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/research/biblioworks.htm

In 1901, as [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], the 42-year-old Roosevelt succeeded President [[William McKinley]] after [[William McKinley assassination|McKinley's assassination]] by [[anarchist]] [[Leon Czolgosz]]. He is the youngest person to become President.<ref>[[John F. Kennedy]] is the youngest person to be ''elected'' President.  Roosevelt was not elected until 1904, when he was 46.</ref> He was a [[Progressive Era|Progressive]] reformer who sought to move the dominant Republican Party into the Progressive camp. He distrusted wealthy businessmen and dissolved forty [[monopoly|monopolistic]] corporations as a "[[trust-busting|trust buster]]". He was clear, however, to show he did not disagree with [[trust (law)|trusts]] and [[capitalism]] in principle but was only against corrupt, illegal practices. His "[[Square Deal]]" promised a fair shake for both the average citizen (through regulation of railroad rates and [[Pure Food and Drug Act|pure food and drugs]]) and the businessmen. He was the first U.S. president to call for [[universal health care]] and [[national health insurance]].<ref>[http://www.healthinsurance.info/issues-and-advocacy/National-Health-Care.HTM National Health Care], HealthInsurance.info</ref><ref>Chris Farrell, [http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jan2006/nf20060123_1965_db013.htm It's Time to Cure Health Care], BusinessWeek</ref> As an outdoorsman, he promoted the [[conservation movement]], emphasizing efficient use of natural resources. After 1906 he attacked big business and suggested the courts were biased against [[labor union]]s. In 1910, he broke with his friend and anointed successor [[William Howard Taft]], but lost the Republican nomination to Taft and ran in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1912|1912 election]] on his own one-time [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Bull Moose]] ticket. He beat Taft in the popular vote and pulled so many Progressives out of the Republican Party that Democrat [[Woodrow Wilson]] won in 1912, and the [[American conservatism|conservative]] faction took control of the Republican Party for the next two decades.

Roosevelt negotiated for the U.S. to take control of the [[Panama Canal]] and its construction in 1904; he felt the Canal's completion was his most important and historically significant international achievement. He was the first American to be awarded the [[Nobel Prize]], winning its [[Nobel Peace Prize|Peace Prize]] in 1906, for negotiating the peace in the [[Russo-Japanese War]].

Historian [[Thomas A. Bailey|Thomas Bailey]], who disagreed with Roosevelt's policies, nevertheless concluded, "Roosevelt was a great personality, a great activist, a great preacher of the moralities, a great controversialist, a great showman. He dominated his era as he dominated conversations....the masses loved him; he proved to be a great popular idol and a great vote getter."<ref>{{cite book |last = Bailey|first = Thomas A.|authorlink = |coauthors = |year = 1966|title =Presidential Greatness|publisher = Appleton-Century Crofts|location = New York |id = |pages= 308}}</ref> His image stands alongside [[George Washington|Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] and [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] on [[Mount Rushmore]].

==Childhood, education and personal life==
[[Image:TR Age 11 Paris.jpg|thumb|right|Theodore Roosevelt at age 11]]
Theodore Roosevelt was born in a [[Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site|four-story brownstone at 28 East 20th Street]]{{Dubious}}, in the modern-day [[Gramercy, New York|Gramercy]] section of [[New York City]], the second of four children of [[Theodore Roosevelt, Sr.]] (1831<U+2013>1877) and [[Martha Bulloch|Mittie Bulloch]] (1834<U+2013>1884). He had an elder sister [[Bamie Roosevelt|Anna]], nicknamed "Bamie" as a child and "Bye" as an adult for being always on the go, and two younger siblings<U+2014>his brother [[Elliott Roosevelt I|Elliott]] (the father of [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]) and his sister [[Corinne Roosevelt Robinson|Corinne]] (grandmother of [[newspaper]] columnists [[Joseph Alsop|Joseph]] and [[Stewart Alsop]]). 

The Roosevelts had been in New York since the mid-17th century and had grown with the emerging New York commerce class after the [[American Revolution]]. Roosevelt was born into a wealthy family; by the 19th century, the family had grown in wealth, power and influence from the profits of several businesses including hardware and plate-glass importing. The family was strongly [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] in its political affiliation until the mid-1850s, then joined the new [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. Theodore's father, known in the family as "Thee", was a New York City [[philanthropy|philanthropist]], merchant, and partner in the family glass-importing firm Roosevelt and Son. He was a prominent supporter of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] effort during the [[American Civil War]]. His mother Mittie Bulloch was a Southern belle from a [[slavery in the United States|slave]]-owning family in [[Savannah, Georgia]] and had quiet [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathies. Mittie's brother, Theodore's uncle, [[James Dunwoody Bulloch]], was a [[United States Navy]] officer who became a Confederate admiral and naval procurement agent in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. Another uncle, [[Irvine Bulloch]], was a midshipman on the Confederate raider [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']]; both remained in England after the war.<ref>Pringle (1931) p. 11</ref> From his grandparents' home, a young Roosevelt witnessed Abraham Lincoln's funeral procession in New York.

Sickly and [[asthma]]tic as a youngster, Roosevelt had to sleep propped up in bed or slouching in a chair during much of his early childhood, and had frequent ailments. Despite his illnesses, he was a hyperactive and often mischievous young man. His lifelong interest in [[zoology]] was formed at age seven upon seeing a dead [[Pinniped|seal]] at a local market. After obtaining the seal's head, the young Roosevelt and two of his cousins formed what they called the "Roosevelt Museum of Natural History". Learning the rudiments of [[taxidermy]], he filled his makeshift museum with many animals that he killed or caught, studied, and prepared for display. At age nine, he codified his observation of insects with a paper titled "The Natural History of Insects".<ref name="environment">[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/tr/envir.html "TR's Legacy<U+2014>The Environment"]. Retrieved [[March 6]] [[2006]].</ref>

To combat his poor physical condition, his father compelled the young Roosevelt to take up exercise. To deal with bullies, Roosevelt started [[boxing]] lessons.<ref>Thayer, William Roscoe (1919). [http://www.bartleby.com/170/ ''Theodore Roosevelt: An Intimate Biography''], Chapter I, p. 20. Bartleby.com.</ref> Two trips abroad had a permanent impact: family tours of Europe in 1869 and 1870, and of the [[Middle East]] 1872 to 1873.

Theodore Sr. had a tremendous influence on his son. Of him Roosevelt wrote, "My father, Theodore Roosevelt, was the best man I ever knew. He combined strength and courage with gentleness, tenderness, and great unselfishness. He would not tolerate in us children selfishness or cruelty, idleness, cowardice, or untruthfulness."<ref>Roosevelt, Theodore (1913). ''Theodore Roosevelt: An Autobiography'', Chapter I, p. 13. </ref> Roosevelt's sister{{Clarifyme}} later wrote, "He told me frequently that he never took any serious step or made any vital decision for his country without thinking first what position his father would have taken."<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/26_t_roosevelt/filmmore/filmscript.html "The Film & More: Program Transcript Part One"].

Young "Teedie"<!-- Note to editors: Yes, he was called "Teedie." This is not a typo. This is sourced, please do not alter it. -->, as he was nicknamed as a child, (the nickname "Teddy" was from his first wife, Alice Hathaway Lee, and he later harbored an intense dislike for it) was mostly home schooled by tutors and his parents. A leading biographer says: "The most obvious drawback to the home schooling Roosevelt received was uneven coverage of the various areas of human knowledge." He was solid in geography (thanks to his careful observations on all his travels) and very well read in history, strong in [[biology]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]], but deficient in [[mathematics]], [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].<ref> Brands ''T. R.'' p. 49<U+2013>50</ref> He matriculated at [[Harvard College]] in 1876, graduating [[magna cum laude]]. His father's death in 1878 was a tremendous blow, but Roosevelt redoubled his activities. He did well in [[science]], [[philosophy]] and [[rhetoric]] courses but fared poorly in Latin and Greek. He studied biology with great interest and indeed was already an accomplished naturalist and published [[ornithology|ornithologist]]. He had a [[eidetic memory|photographic memory]] and developed a life-long habit of devouring books, memorizing every detail.<ref>Brands p. 62</ref> He was an eloquent conversationalist who, throughout his life, sought out the company of the smartest people. He could multitask in extraordinary fashion, dictating letters to one secretary and memoranda to another, while browsing through a new book.

While at Harvard, Roosevelt was active in rowing, boxing and the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] fraternity. He also edited a student magazine. He was runner-up in the Harvard boxing championship, losing to [[C.S. Hanks]]. The sportsmanship he showed in that fight was long remembered. Upon graduating from Harvard, he underwent a physical examination and his doctor advised him that due to serious heart problems, he should find a desk job and avoid strenuous activity. He chose to embrace strenuous life instead.<ref>''The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt'' by Edmund Morris.</ref>

He graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and ''magna cum laude'' (22nd of 177) from Harvard in 1880, and entered [[Columbia Law School]]. When offered a chance to run for [[New York Assembly]]man in 1881, he dropped out of law school to pursue his new goal of entering public life.<ref>Brands, pp 123<U+2013>29</ref>
                           
[[Image:TR NY State Assemblyman 1883.jpg|thumb|left|Roosevelt as NY State Assemblyman, 1883 photo]]

Roosevelt was a [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] activist during his years in the Assembly, writing more bills than any other New York state legislator. Already a major player in state politics, he attended the [[Republican National Convention]] in 1884 and fought alongside the [[Mugwump]] reformers; they lost to the [[Stalwart (politics)|Stalwart]] faction that nominated [[James G. Blaine]]. Refusing to join other Mugwumps in supporting Democrat [[Grover Cleveland]], the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] nominee, he debated with his friend [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] the plusses and minuses of staying loyal or straying. When asked by a reporter whether he would support Blaine, he replied, "That question I decline to answer. It is a subject I do not care to talk about."<ref>"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt," by Edmund Morris, pg 267.</ref> Upon leaving the convention, he complained "[[off the record]]" to a reporter about Blaine's nomination. But, in probably the most crucial moment of his young political career, he resisted the very instinct to bolt from the Party that would overwhelm his political sense in 1912. In an account of the Convention, another reporter quoted him as saying that he would give "hearty support to any decent Democrat." He would later take great (and to some historical critics such as Henry Pringle, rather disingenuous) pains to distance himself from his own earlier comment, indicating that while he made it, it had not been made "for publication."<ref>"Theodore Roosevelt, A Biography, by Henry Pringle", pg 61</ref>

====First marriage====
[[Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt|Alice Hathaway Lee]] ([[July 29]] [[1861]] in [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts]] <U+2013> [[February 14]] [[1884]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York]]) was the first wife of Theodore Roosevelt and mother of their only child together, [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth|Alice Lee Roosevelt]]. Alice Roosevelt died of an undiagnosed case of [[Bright's disease]] two days after Alice Lee was born. Theodore Roosevelt's mother Mittie died of [[typhoid fever]] in the same house on the same day. After the simultaneous deaths of his mother and wife, Roosevelt left his daughter in the care of his sister in New York and moved out to [[Dakota Territory]].

====Life in Badlands====
[[Image:TR Buckskin Tiffany Knife.jpg|thumb|Theodore Roosevelt as [[Badlands]] hunter in 1885. New York studio photo.]]

Roosevelt built a second ranch, which he named Elk Horn, thirty-five miles (56 km) north of the boomtown of [[Medora, North Dakota]]. On the banks of the [[Little Missouri River (North Dakota)|Little Missouri]], Roosevelt learned to ride, rope, and hunt. He rebuilt his life and began writing about frontier life for Eastern magazines. As a deputy sheriff, Roosevelt hunted down three outlaws who stole his river boat and were escaping north with it up the Little Missouri. Capturing them, he decided against hanging them, and sending his foreman back by boat, he took the thieves back overland for trial in [[Dickinson, North Dakota|Dickinson]], guarding them forty hours without sleep and reading [[Tolstoy]] to keep himself awake. When he ran out of his own books, he read a [[dime novel|dime store western]] that one of the thieves was carrying.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}  

While working on a tough project aimed at hunting down a group of relentless horse thieves, Roosevelt came across the famous [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[South Dakota]] [[Sheriff]] [[Seth Bullock]]. The two would remain friends for life. (Morris, Rise of, 241<U+2013>245, 247<U+2013>250)

After the uniquely severe U.S. [[winter of 1886-1887]] wiped out his herd of cattle and his $60,000 investment (together with those of his competitors), he returned to the East, where in 1885 he had built [[Sagamore Hill]] in [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay]], [[New York]]. It would be his home and estate until his death. Roosevelt ran as the Republican candidate for mayor of New York City in 1886 as "The Cowboy of the Dakotas"; he came in third.

====Second marriage====
Following the election, he went to [[London]] in 1886 and married his childhood sweetheart, [[Edith Roosevelt|Edith Kermit Carow]].<ref>Thayer, Chapter V, pp. 4, 6.</ref> They honeymooned in Europe, and Roosevelt led a party to the summit of [[Mont Blanc]], a feat which resulted in his induction into the [[British Royal Society]].<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica, 1910 Edition, Topic: Theodore Roosevelt </ref> They had five children: [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.|Theodore Jr.]], [[Kermit Roosevelt|Kermit]], [[Ethel Roosevelt Derby|Ethel Carow]], [[Archibald Roosevelt|Archibald Bulloch]] "Archie", and [[Quentin Roosevelt|Quentin]].<ref> Although Roosevelt's father was also named Theodore Roosevelt, he died while the future president was still childless and unmarried, so the future President Roosevelt took the suffix of Sr. and subsequently named his son Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. Because Roosevelt was still alive when his grandson and namesake was born, his grandson was named [[Theodore Roosevelt III]], and the president's son retained the Jr. after his father's death.</ref>

====Historian====
Roosevelt's definitive 1882 book ''The Naval War of 1812'' was standard history for two generations. Roosevelt undertook extensive and original research, computing British and American [[man-of-war]] [[broadside]] throw weights.<ref>See [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/9104.html ''The Naval War of 1812''], via Project Gutenberg. </ref> However, his biographies of ''[[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]]'' (1887) and ''[[Gouverneur Morris]]'' (1888) are considered hastily-written and superficial.<ref>Pringle (1931) p 116 </ref> His four-volume history of the frontier titled ''The Winning of the West'' (1889<U+2013>1896) had a notable impact on [[historiography]], as it presented a highly original version of the [[frontier thesis]] elaborated upon by his friend [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] in 1893.

Roosevelt argued the frontier conditions created a new [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]: the American people that replaced the "scattered savage tribes, whose life was but a few degrees less meaningless, squalid, and ferocious than that of the wild beasts with whom they held joint ownership." He believed, "the conquest and settlement by the whites of the Indian lands was necessary to the greatness of the race and to the well-being of civilized mankind." His many articles in upscale magazines provided a much-needed income. He was later chosen president of the [[American Historical Association]].

====Views on race====
In ''The Winning of the West'' (1889<U+2013>1896), Roosevelt's frontier thesis stressed a racial struggle between "civilization" (white, especially [[Germanic]] peoples) and supposed savagery (of people of color). Excerpts: 

# "The settler and pioneer have at bottom had justice on their side; this great continent could not have been kept as nothing but a game preserve for squalid savages."
# "The most ultimately righteous of all wars is a war with savages."
# "American and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]], [[Boer]] and [[Zulu]], [[Cossack]] and [[Tartar]], [[P<U+0101>keh<U+0101>|New Zealander]] and [[Maori]], <U+2014> in each case the victor, horrible though many of his deeds are, has laid deep the foundations for the future greatness of a mighty people."
# "..it is of incalculable importance that America, [[Australia]], and [[Siberia]] should pass out of the hands of their red, black, and yellow aboriginal owners, and become the heritage of the dominant world races."
# "The world would have halted had it not been for the Teutonic conquests in alien lands; but the victories of [[Muslim|Moslem]] over [[Christian]] have always proved a curse in the end. Nothing but sheer evil has come from the victories of Turk and Tartar."

In [[Brownsville, Texas]], racial tensions were high between white townsfolk and black infantrymen stationed at Fort Brown. Two white townspeople were murdered and the townsfolk blamed the infantrymen. Roosevelt immediately dishonorably discharged all soldiers in the three all black companies (that fought alongside Roosevelt in the Spanish American War) due to their "conspiracy of silence." Further investigations in the 1970s found they were not involved and they were pardoned by President Nixon.

Some notable events in Theodore Roosevelt's life include:

*Inviting African American reformer [[Booker T. Washington]] to a dinner at the [[White House]], an action which caused outrage among many newspapers in the [[Southern United States|South]], which objected to "mixing of the races on social occasions."

*Appointed the Collector of the Port of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] post to an African-American, Dr. William D. Crum, and when he was urged to withdraw the appointment, wrote the following:

:''I do not intend to appoint any unfit man to office. So far as I legitimately can, I shall always endeavor to pay regard to the wishes and feelings of the people of each locality; but I cannot consent to take the position that the doorway of hope - the door of opportunity - is to be shut upon any man, no matter how worthy, purely upon the grounds of race or color. Such an attitude would, according to my contentions, be fundamentally wrong.''

*Defended the [[Postmaster]] of [[Indianola, Mississippi]], Minnie D. Cox. She was an African-American, and on that basis alone she was threatened with mob violence and was forced to resign. Roosevelt took action by closing the post office there, ignoring her resignation, and still paying her what she was due as if nothing had happened.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/Civil%20Rights.htm#AfricanAmer|title=TR & Civil Rights|author=Theodore Roosevelt Association}}</ref>

===Return to public life===
[[Image:tr nyc police commissioner.jpg|thumb|right|New York City Police Commissioner 1896]] 

In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1888|1888 presidential election]], Roosevelt campaigned in the Midwest for [[Benjamin Harrison]]. President Harrison appointed Roosevelt to the [[United States Civil Service Commission]], where he served until 1895.<ref>Thayer, ch. VI, pp. 1<U+2013>2.</ref> In his term, he vigorously fought the [[spoils system|spoilsmen]] and demanded the enforcement of civil service laws. In spite of Roosevelt's support for Harrison's reelection bid in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1892|presidential election of 1892]], the eventual winner, [[Grover Cleveland]] (a [[Bourbon Democrat]]), reappointed him to the same post. {{Fact|date=October 2007}}

Roosevelt became president of the board of [[New York City Police Commissioner]]s in 1895. During the two years he held this post, Roosevelt radically reformed the police department. The police force was reputed as one of the most corrupt in America. The NYPD's history division records that Roosevelt was "an iron-willed leader of unimpeachable honesty, (who) brought a reforming zeal to the New York City Police Commission in 1895."<ref>Andrews, William, "The Early Years: The Challenge of Public Order - 1845 to 1870", [http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/3100/retro.html - New York City Police Department History Site].

During his tenure, a Municipal Lodging House was established by the Board of Charities, and Roosevelt required officers to register with the Board. He also had telephones installed in station houses. Always an energetic man, he made a habit of walking officers' beats late at night and early in the morning to make sure they were on duty.<ref>Brands ch 11</ref> He became caught up in public disagreements with commissioner Parker, who sought to negate or delay the promotion of many officers put forward by Roosevelt. {{Fact|date=October 2007}}

====Assistant Secretary of the Navy====
[[Image:Roosevelt T 1897 02928.jpg|250px|thumb|Assistant Secretary of the Navy Roosevelt (front center) at the Naval War College, c. 1897]]

Roosevelt had always been fascinated by naval history. Urged by Roosevelt's close friend, Congressman [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], President [[William McKinley]] appointed a delighted Roosevelt to the post of [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] in 1897. (Because of the inactivity of [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[John D. Long]] at the time, this basically gave Roosevelt control over the department.) Roosevelt was instrumental in preparing the Navy for the [[Spanish-American War]]<ref>Brands ch 12</ref> and was an enthusiastic proponent of testing the U.S. military in battle, at one point stating "I should welcome almost any war, for I think this country needs one".<ref name="PBS1">{{cite web |last = |first =  |authorlink = |coauthors = |year = |url = http://www.pbs.org/crucible/tl7.html |title = April 16, 1897: T.

====War in Cuba====
{{Main|Battle of San Juan Hill}}
[[Image:TR San Juan Hill 1898.jpg|250px|thumb|Colonel Roosevelt and the [[Rough Riders]] after capturing San Juan Hill]]

Upon the 1898 [[Declaration of War]] launching the Spanish-American War, Roosevelt resigned from the Navy Department. With the aid of U.S. Army Colonel [[Leonard Wood]], Roosevelt found volunteers from [[cowboy]]s from the Western territories to [[Ivy League]] friends from New York, forming the [[Rough Riders|First U.S. Volunteer Cavalry Regiment]]. The newspapers called them the "Rough Riders." [[Image:Theodore Rooseveltnewtry.jpg|150px|thumb|Col. Theodore Roosevelt]]
Originally Roosevelt held the rank of [[Lieutenant Colonel]] and served under Colonel Wood, but after Wood was promoted to [[Brigadier General]] of Volunteer Forces, Roosevelt was promoted to Colonel and given command of the Regiment.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}. 
 
Under his leadership, the Rough Riders became famous for dual charges up [[Kettle Hill]] and [[Battle of San Juan Hill|San Juan Hill]] on [[July 1]],[[1898]] (the battle was named after the latter "hill," which was the shoulder of a ridge known as San Juan Heights). Out of all the Rough Riders, Roosevelt was the only one with a horse, and used it to ride back and forth between rifle pits at the forefront of the advance up Kettle Hill; an advance which he urged in absence of any orders from superiors. However, he was forced to walk up the last part of Kettle Hill on foot, due to barbed wire entanglement and after his horse, Little Texas, became tired.

For his actions, Roosevelt was nominated for the [[Medal of Honor]] which was subsequently disapproved. It has been widely speculated this disapproval was because of Roosevelt's outspoken comments on the handling of the war. In September 1997, Congressman [[Rick Lazio]], representing the 2nd District of New York, sent two award recommendations to the U.S. Army Military Awards Branch. These recommendations, addressed to Brigadier General Earl Simms, the Army's Adjutant General, and Master Sergeant Gary Soots, Chief of Authorizations, would prove successful in garnering the much sought after award.<ref>Soots Letter</ref> Roosevelt was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in 2001 for his actions.<ref>Brands ch 13</ref> He was the first and, as of [[2008]], the only President of the United States to be awarded with America's highest military honor, and the only person in history to receive both his nation's highest honor for military valor and the world's foremost prize for peace.<ref name=MedalofHonor>{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-25

[[Image:TR-Cowboy.JPG|175px|left|thumb|Chicago newspaper sees cowboy-TR campaigning for governor]]

After his return to civilian life, Roosevelt preferred to be known as "Colonel Roosevelt" or "The Colonel." As a moniker, "Teddy" remained much more popular with the general public; however, political friends and others working closely with Roosevelt customarily addressed him by his rank.

====Governor and Vice President====
On leaving the Army, Roosevelt was elected governor of New York in 1898 as a Republican. He made such a concerted effort to root out corruption and "[[machine politics]]" that Republican boss [[Thomas C. Platt|Thomas Collier Platt]] forced him on McKinley as a running mate in [[United States presidential election, 1900|the 1900 election]], against the wishes of McKinley's manager, Senator [[Mark Hanna]]. Roosevelt was a powerful campaign asset for the Republican ticket, which defeated [[William Jennings Bryan]] in a landslide based on restoration of prosperity at home and a successful war and new prestige abroad. Bryan stumped for [[Free Silver]] again, but McKinley's promise of prosperity through the [[gold standard]], high tariffs, and the restoration of business confidence enlarged his margin of victory. Bryan had strongly supported the war against Spain, but denounced the annexation of the [[Philippines]] as imperialism that would spoil America's innocence. Roosevelt countered with many speeches that argued it was best for the Filipinos to have stability, and the Americans to have a proud place in the world. Roosevelt's six months as Vice President (March to September 1901) were uneventful.<ref>Brands ch 14<U+2013>15</ref> On [[September 2]] [[1901]], at the [[Minnesota State Fair]], Roosevelt first used in a public speech a saying that would later be universally associated with him: "[[Big Stick Diplomacy|Speak softly and carry a big stick, and you will go far."]]

==Presidency 1901<U+2013>1909==
{{main|Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt}}
[[Image:TR Inaugurationsketch.jpg|thumb|right|Nashville Tennessee News sketch of Theodore Roosevelt inauguration minus the customary Bible. Inauguration photos were not allowed after a rival photographer unceremoniously knocked down another's camera.]]
At the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in [[Buffalo, New York]], on [[September 6]] [[1901]], [[William McKinley|President McKinley]] was shot by [[Leon Czolgosz]] (Zol-gash). Roosevelt had been mountain climbing with his family when he heard the news. He rushed to Buffalo, but after being assured the President would recover, he went on a planned family camping and hiking trip to [[Mount Marcy]]. In the mountains, a runner notified him McKinley was on his death bed. Roosevelt pondered with his wife, Edith, how best to respond, not wanting to show up in Buffalo and wait on McKinley's death. Roosevelt was rushed by a series of stagecoaches to North Creek train station. At the station, Roosevelt was handed a telegram that said President McKinley died at 2:30 AM that morning. Roosevelt continued by train from North Creek to Buffalo. He arrived in Buffalo later that day, accepting an invitation to stay at the home of [[Ansley Wilcox]], a prominent lawyer and friend since the early 1880s when they had both worked closely with New York State Governor [[Grover Cleveland]] on civil service reform.
 
Roosevelt took the oath of office in the [[Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site|Ansley Wilcox House]] at Buffalo, borrowing Wilcox's morning coat. Roosevelt did not swear on a [[Bible]],<ref name="oath">{{cite web |last = |first =  |authorlink = |coauthors = |year = |url = http://usinfo.state.gov/special/inauguration/inauguration_oath.html |title = The Oath of Office |format = |work = |publisher = USInfo.State.gov|accessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref> in contrast to the usual tradition of US presidents.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/pihtml/pibible.html Bibles and Scripture Passages Used by Presidents in Taking the Oath of Office].

Roosevelt did so, but after winning election in [[U.S. presidential election, 1904|1904]], he moved to the political left, stretching his ties to the Republican Party's conservative leaders.<ref>Brands ch 16</ref>

====Anthracite coal strike of 1902====
{{main|Coal Strike of 1902}}

A national emergency was averted in 1902 when Roosevelt found a compromise to the anthracite coal strike by the [[United Mine Workers of America]] that threatened the heating supplies of most urban homes. Roosevelt called the mine owners and the labor leaders to the White House and negotiated a compromise. Miners were on strike for 163 days before it ended; they were granted a 10% pay increase and a 9-hour day (from the previous 10 hours), but the union was not officially recognized, and the price of coal went up.<ref>Brands ch 17</ref>

====Square Deal and regulation of industry====
[[Image:PuckCartoonTeddyRooseveltAsInfantHercules05231906.jpg#Summary|thumb|right|250px|Grappling with [[Standard Oil]] in [[Puck (magazine)|Puck]] magazine]]
Roosevelt promised to continue McKinley's program, and at first he worked closely with McKinley's men. His 20,000-word address to the [[United States Congress|Congress]] in December 1901 asked Congress to curb the power of [[trust (19th century)|trust]]s "within reasonable limits." They did not act but Roosevelt did, issuing 44 lawsuits against major corporations; he was called the "[[Trust Buster|trust-buster]]".

Roosevelt firmly believed: "The Government must in increasing degree supervise and regulate the workings of the railways engaged in interstate commerce." Inaction was a danger, he argued: "Such increased supervision is the only alternative to an increase of the present evils on the one hand or a still more radical policy on the other."<ref>Annual Message December 1904</ref> 

His biggest success was passage of the [[Hepburn Act]] of 1906, the provisions of which were to be regulated by the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC). The most important provision of the Act gave the ICC the power to replace existing rates with "just-and-reasonable" maximum rates, with the ICC to define what was just and reasonable. Anti-rebate provisions were toughened, free passes were outlawed, and the penalties for violation were increased. Finally, the ICC gained the power to prescribe a uniform system of accounting, require standardized reports, and inspect railroad accounts. The Act made ICC orders binding; that is, the railroads had to either obey or contest the ICC orders in federal court. To speed the process, appeals from the [[United States District Court|district courts]] would go directly to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].

In response to public clamor (and due to the uproar cause by [[Upton Sinclair]]'s book ''[[The Jungle]]''), Roosevelt pushed Congress to pass the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] of 1906, as well as the [[Meat Inspection Act]] of 1906. These laws provided for labeling of foods and drugs, inspection of livestock and mandated sanitary conditions at meatpacking plants. Congress replaced Roosevelt's proposals with a version supported by the major meatpackers who worried about the overseas markets, and did not want small unsanitary plants undercutting their domestic market.<ref>Blum 1980 pp 43<U+2013>44</ref>

[[Image:Militarist.JPG|thumb|left|Democrats attack Roosevelt as militarist and ineffective in this 1904 election cartoon.]]

====Election in 1904====
{{main|United States presidential election, 1904}}
Theodore Roosevelt was the fifth Vice President to succeed to the office of President, but the first to win election in his own right. ([[Millard Fillmore]] ran and lost on a third-party ticket four years after leaving office, and [[Chester Arthur]] was denied nomination by his party in 1884). After Senator [[Mark Hanna]], McKinley's old campaign manager, died in February 1904, there was no one in the Republican Party to oppose Roosevelt, and he easily won the nomination. When an effort to draft former president [[Grover Cleveland]] failed, the Democrats were without a candidate and finally settled on obscure New York judge [[Alton B. Parker]]. The outcome was never in doubt. Roosevelt crushed Parker 56%-38% in the popular vote and 336-140 in the [[Electoral College]], sweeping the country outside the perennially Democratic [[Solid South]]. Socialist [[Eugene Debs]] got 3%. The night of the election, after his victory was clear, Roosevelt promised not to run again in 1908. He later regretted that promise, as it compelled him to leave the White House at the age of only fifty, at the height of his popularity.

====Conservationist====
[[Image:TR & Pinchot 1907.jpg|thumb|left|Roosevelt worked closely with early conservationists such as [[Gifford Pinchot]], pictured above, with whom he organized the first National Governors Conservation Conference at the White House in 1908]]
Roosevelt was the first American president to consider the long-term needs for efficient conservation of national resources, winning the support of fellow hunters and fishermen to bolster his political base. He was the last trained observer to ever see a [[passenger pigeon]], and on [[March 14]] [[1903]], Roosevelt created the first National Bird Preserve, (the beginning of the Wildlife Refuge system) on Pelican Island, [[Florida]]. He recognized the imminent extinction of the [[American Bison]] and co-founded the [[American Bison Society]] (with [[William Temple Hornaday]]) in 1905. Roosevelt worked with the major figures of the [[conservation movement]], especially his chief adviser on the matter, [[Gifford Pinchot]]. Roosevelt urged Congress to establish the [[United States Forest Service]] (1905), to manage government forest lands, and he appointed Gifford Pinchot to head the service. Roosevelt set aside more land for [[national park]]s and [[nature preserve]]s than all of his predecessors combined, 194 million acres (785,000 km<U+00B2>). In all, by 1909, the Roosevelt administration had created an unprecedented 42 million acres (170,000 km<U+00B2>) of [[national forest]]s, 53 [[national wildlife refuge]]s and 18 areas of "special interest", including the [[Grand Canyon]]. The [[Theodore Roosevelt National Park]] in the [[Badlands]] commemorates his conservationist philosophy. [[Image:Muir and Roosevelt restored.jpg|thumb|Roosevelt and Muir]] In 1903, Roosevelt toured the [[Yosemite Valley]] with [[John Muir]], founder of the [[Sierra Club]], but Roosevelt believed in the more efficient use of natural resources by corporations like lumber companies unlike Muir. In 1907, with Congress about to block him, Roosevelt hurried to designate 16 million acres (65,000 km<U+00B2>) of new national forests. In May 1908, he sponsored the [[Conference of Governors]] held in the White House, with a focus on the most efficient planning, analysis and use of water, forests and other natural resources. Roosevelt explained, "There is an intimate relation between our streams and the development and conservation of all the other great permanent sources of wealth." During his presidency, Roosevelt promoted the nascent conservation movement in essays for ''[[Outdoor Life]]'' magazine. To Roosevelt, conservation meant more and better usage and less waste, and a long-term perspective.<!-- ref>In 2006, a group of American high school students developed a 10 minute video on Roosevelt's conservation legacy with the help of Roosevelt scholar [[Edward Renehan]] and Roosevelt descendant [[Tweed Roosevelt]]. See{{cite web|title=American High School Students, "Theodore Roosevelt: Conserving America's Future" ''YouTUBE Presentation on Theodore Roosevelt and Conservation, [[YouTube]] ([[April 23]] [[2006]]) Online Edition |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxf9eYWiaM|accessdate=2006-10-11}}</ref> Commented out because it's a YouTube link used as a ref, it's original research, and really it's not a reference. But maybe someone else will think differently. -->{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

Roosevelt's conservationist leanings also impelled him to preserve national sites of scientific, particularly [[archaeology|archaeological]], interest. The 1906 passage of the [[Antiquities Act]] gave him a tool for creating [[U.S. National Monument|national monuments]] by presidential proclamation, without requiring Congressional approval for each monument on an item-by-item basis. The language of the Antiquities Act specifically called for the preservation of "historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest," and was primarily construed by its creator, Congressman [[James F. Lacey]] (assisted by the prominent archaeologist [[Edgar Lee Hewett]]), as targeting the prehistoric ruins of the American Southwest. Roosevelt, however, applied a typically broad interpretation to the Act, and the first national monument he proclaimed, [[Devils Tower National Monument]] in [[Wyoming]], was preserved for reasons tied more to [[geology]] than archaeology.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

Roosevelt's conservationism caused him to forbid having a [[Christmas tree]] in the [[White House]]. He was reportedly upset when he found a small tree his son had been hiding. After learning about the commercial farming of Christmas trees, where no [[Old growth forest|virgin forests]] were cut down to supply the demand during the Christmas holiday, he relented and allowed his family to have a tree each season.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

===Foreign policy===
In [[Cuba]], the [[Philippines]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[Panama Canal Zone]], Roosevelt used the Army's medical service, under [[Walter Reed]] and [[William C. Gorgas]], to eliminate the [[yellow fever]] and install a new regime of public health. The Philippines saw the U.S. Army for the first time using a systematic doctrine of counter-insurgency. Despite the ad hoc nature of the force deployed by Roosevelt the Army was able to end the insurgency by 1902. 

[[Image:Panam2.JPG|thumb|Roosevelt builds the canal&mdash;and shovels dirt on Colombia.]]

Roosevelt dramatically increased the size of the navy, forming the [[Great White Fleet]], which toured the world in 1907. This display was  designed to impress the [[Japan]]ese. However, the ships were almost forced to return because of the inadequacy of American ports in the Pacific.<ref>See Edward S Miller,''War Plan Orange'' (Annapolis, 1991) </ref> Roosevelt also added the [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], which stated that the United States and only the United States could intervene in [[Latin America]]n affairs when corruption of governments made it necessary. Roosevelt's foreign policy is often referred to as the "Big Stick" policy which was mainly in respect to Roosevelt's ideas of negotiation.

Roosevelt gained international praise for helping negotiate the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. Roosevelt later arbitrated a dispute between [[France]] and [[German Empire|Germany]] over the division of [[Morocco]]. Some historians have argued these latter two actions helped in a small way to avert a [[world war]].<ref>The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia (2005).

=====Panama Canal=====
{{main|Panama Canal}}
Roosevelt's most famous foreign policy initiative, following the [[Hay-Pauncefote Treaty]], was the construction of the [[Panama Canal]], which upon its completion shortened the route of freighters between [[San Francisco, California]] and [[New York City]] by 8,000 miles (13,000 km).

[[Colombia]] first proposed the canal in their country as opposed to rival [[Nicaragua]], and Colombia signed a treaty for an agreed-upon sum. At the time, [[Panama]] was a province of Colombia. According to the treaty, in 1902, the U.S. was to buy out the equipment and excavations from France, which had been attempting to build a canal since 1881. While the Colombian negotiating team had signed the treaty, ratification by the Colombian Senate became problematic. The Colombian Senate balked at the price and asked for ten million dollars over the original agreed upon price. When the U.S. refused to re-negotiate the price, the Colombian politicians proposed cutting the original French company that started the project out of the deal and giving that difference to Colombia.

Roosevelt decided in 1903 to support Panamanian separation from Colombia. On [[November 3]], the Republic of Panama was created, with its constitution written in advance by the United States. Shortly thereafter, the U.S. signed a protection treaty with Panama. And after the signing of the treaty, a man named [[Nathan Johnson Forest]] assisted Panama with the initial planning phases for the canal. The U.S. then paid ten million to secure rights to build on, and control, the Canal Zone. Construction began in 1904 and was completed in 1914.

It took a long time to build the Panama Canal because of the rampant spread of tropical diseases. Over 200 workers died of yellow fever and [[malaria]], spread by mosquitoes. Roosevelt initiated work on clearing swamps and other areas in which the insects bred. As the health threat finally receded, this greatly facilitated the construction of the Canal.

=====The Great White Fleet=====
{{main|Great White Fleet}}
[[Image:Tr great white fleet tr addresses us conneticut feb 1909.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Roosevelt (on the 12" gun turret at right) addresses the crew of USS ''Connecticut'' (BB18) in Hampton Roads, Virginia, upon her return from the Fleet's cruise.]] 
As Roosevelt's administration drew to a close, the president dispatched a fleet consisting of four US Navy [[battleship]] squadrons and their escorts, on a world-wide voyage of [[circumnavigation]] from [[December 16]] [[1907]] to [[February 22]] [[1909]]. With their hulls painted white (except for the beautiful gilded scrollwork) and red, white, and blue banners on their bows, these ships would come to be known as the [[Great White Fleet]].  Roosevelt wanted to demonstrate to his country and the world that the US Navy was capable of operating in a global theater, particularly in the Pacific. This was extraordinarily important at a time when tensions were slowly growing between the United States and Japan. The latter had recently shown its navy's competence in defeating the [[Russian Empire|Russians]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]], and the US Navy fleet in the west was relatively small. As a mark of the mission's success, the [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]] battleships only later came to be known as the "Great White Fleet."

When the ''real'' Great White Fleet sailed into [[Yokohama]], Japan, the Japanese went to extraordinary lengths to show that their country desired peace with the US. Thousands of Japanese school children waved American flags, purchased by the government, as they greeted the Navy brass coming ashore. In February 1909, the fleet returned home to Hampton Roads, Virginia, and Roosevelt was there to witness the triumphant return. His appearance indicated that he saw the fleet's long voyage as a fitting finish for his administration. Roosevelt said to the officers of the Fleet, "Other nations may do what you have done, but they'll have to follow you." This parting act of [[grand strategy]] by Roosevelt greatly expanded the respect for, as well as the role of, the United States in the international arena. However, the visit of the Great White Fleet to [[Tokyo]] also encouraged Japanese militarists. They had always argued for an even more aggressive Japanese ship building and naval expansion program, and the recent show of force by the U.S. convinced enough of their countrymen that they were right. In a real sense, this set in motion the chain of events leading to the U.S. and Japan confronting each other 30 years later - during [[World War II]].

====Roosevelt puts Lincoln on the penny====
[[Image:United States penny, obverse, 2002.jpg|thumb|100px|right|A Lincoln cent]]
Roosevelt thought [[Coins of the United States dollar|American coins]] and currency were common and uninspiring. He had the opportunity to pose for a young [[Lithuania]]n-born sculptor, [[Victor David Brenner]], who since arriving nineteen years earlier in the United States had become one of the nation's premier medalists. Roosevelt had learned of Brenner's talents in a settlement house on New York City's [[Lower East Side]] and was immediately impressed with a bas-relief that Brenner had made of Lincoln, based on the early [[American Civil War|Civil War]] era photographer [[Mathew Brady]]'s photograph. Roosevelt, who considered Lincoln the savior of the Union and the greatest Republican President and who also considered himself Lincoln's political heir, ordered the new [[Lincoln cent|Lincoln penny]] to be based on Brenner's work and that it be ready just in time to commemorate Lincoln<U+2019>s 100th birthday in 1909. The likeness of President Lincoln on the obverse of the coin is an adaptation of a plaque Brenner executed several years earlier and which had come to the attention of President Roosevelt in New York.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/opinion/11margolick.html Penny Foolish - New York Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The new Lincoln penny replaced the [[Indian Head cent]].

===Life in the White House===
Roosevelt took Cabinet members and friends on long, fast-paced hikes, boxed in the state rooms of the White House, romped with his children, and read voraciously.<ref name="lion">Hanson, David C.

[[Image:TRSpelling.JPG|thumb|Roosevelt shoots holes in the dictionary as the ghosts of Chaucer, Shakespeare and Dr Johnson moan.]]
During his presidency, Roosevelt tried but did not succeed to advance the cause of [[simplified spelling]]. He tried to force the federal government to adopt the system, sending an order to the Public Printer to use the system in all public federal documents. The order was obeyed, and among the documents thus printed was the President's special message regarding the Panama Canal.

The reform annoyed the public, forcing him to rescind the order. Literary critic [[Brander Matthews]], a friend of Roosevelt and one of the chief advocates of the reform, remonstrated with him for abandoning the effort. Roosevelt replied on [[December 16]]: "I could not by fighting have kept the new spelling in, and it was evidently worse than useless to go into an undignified contest when I was beaten. Do you know that the one word as to which I thought the new spelling was wrong &mdash; thru &mdash; was more responsible than anything else for our discomfiture?" Next summer Roosevelt was watching a naval review when a newspaper launch marked "Pres Bot" chugged ostentatiously by. The President waved and laughed with delight.<ref>Pringle 465<U+2013>7</ref>

Roosevelt's oldest daughter, [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth|Alice]], was a controversial character during his stay in the White House. When friends asked if he could rein in his elder daughter, Roosevelt said, "I can be President of the United States, or I can control Alice. I cannot possibly do both."<ref name="lion"/> In turn, Alice said of him that he always wanted to be "the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral."<ref>Some sources attribute this quote to one of Roosevelt's sons instead. Thayer, Chapter XIII, p. 7.</ref>

Roosevelt's contribution to the White House was the construction of the original [[West Wing]], which he had built to free up the second floor rooms in the residence that formerly housed the president's staff. He and Edith also had the entire house renovated and restored to the [[federal style]], tearing out the Victorian furnishings and details (including [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|Tiffany]] windows) that had been installed over the previous three decades.

====African safari====
[[Image:Roosevelt safari elephant.jpg|thumb|Roosevelt standing next to a dead elephant during a safari]]
In March 1909, shortly after the end of his second term, Roosevelt left New York for a [[safari]] in [[East Africa|east]] and [[central Africa]]. Roosevelt's party landed in [[Mombasa]], [[British East Africa]] (now [[Kenya]]), traveled to the [[Belgian Congo]] (now [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) before following the [[Nile]] up to [[Khartoum]] in modern [[Sudan]]. Financed by [[Andrew Carnegie]] and by his own proposed writings, Roosevelt's party hunted for specimens for the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and for the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York. The group included scientists from the Smithsonian and was led by the legendary hunter-tracker R.J. Cunninghame and was joined from time to time by [[Frederick Selous]], the famous big game hunter and explorer.  Among other items, Roosevelt brought with him four tons of salt for perserving animal hides, a lucky rabbit's foot given to him by boxer [[John L. Sullivan]], an elephant-rifle donated by a group of 56 admiring Britons, and the famous Pigskin Library, a collection of classics bound in pig leather and transported in a single reinforced trunk.

All told, Roosevelt and his companions killed or trapped over 11,397 animals, from [[insect]]s and [[Mole (animal)|moles]] to [[hippopotamus]]es and [[elephant]]s. 512 of the animals were big game animals, including six rare [[White Rhinoceros|white rhinos]]. 262 of these were consumed by the expedition. Tons of salted animals and their skins were shipped to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]; the quantity was so large that it took years to [[taxidermy|mount]] them all, and the Smithsonian was able to share many duplicate animals with other [[museum]]s. 

Regarding the large number of animals taken, Roosevelt said, "I can be condemned only if the existence of the [[National Museum of Natural History|National Museum]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and all similar zoological institutions are to be condemned."<ref>O'Toole, Patricia (2005) ''When Trumpets Call'', p. 67, Simon and Schuster, ISBN 0-684-86477-0 </ref> However, although the safari was ostensibly conducted in the name of [[science]], there was another, quite large element to it as well. In addition to many native peoples and local leaders, interaction with renowned professional hunters and land owning families made the safari as much a political and social event, as it was a hunting excursion. Roosevelt wrote a detailed account of the adventure in the book "African Game Trails", where he describes the excitement of the chase, the people he met, and the [[flora]] and [[fauna]] he collected in the name of science.

===Republican Party rift===
Roosevelt certified [[William Howard Taft]] to be a genuine "progressive" in [[U.S. presidential election, 1908|1908]], when Roosevelt pushed through the nomination of his Secretary of War for the Presidency. Taft easily defeated three-time candidate [[William Jennings Bryan]]. Taft had a different progressivism, one that stressed the rule of law and preferred that judges rather than administrators or politicians make the basic decisions about fairness. Taft usually proved a less adroit politician than Roosevelt and lacked the energy and personal magnetism, not to mention the publicity devices, the dedicated supporters, and the broad base of public support that made Roosevelt so formidable. When Roosevelt realized that lowering the tariff would risk severe tensions inside the Republican Party&mdash;pitting producers (manufacturers and farmers) against merchants and consumers&mdash;he stopped talking about the issue. Taft ignored the risks and tackled the tariff boldly, on the one hand encouraging reformers to fight for lower rates, and then cutting deals with conservative leaders that kept overall rates high. The resulting [[Payne-Aldrich tariff]] of 1909 was too high for most reformers, but instead of blaming this on Senator [[Nelson Aldrich]] and big business, Taft took credit, calling it the best tariff ever. Again he had managed to alienate all sides. While the crisis was building inside the Party, Roosevelt was touring Africa and Europe, so as to allow Taft to be his own man.<ref>Thayer, Chapter XXI, p. 10.</ref>
[[Image:TAFT1909.JPG|204px|thumb|left|1909 cartoon: TR hands his policies to the care of Taft while [[William Loeb]] carries the "Big Stick"]]
Unlike Roosevelt, Taft never attacked business or businessmen in his rhetoric. However, he was attentive to the law, so he launched 90 antitrust suits, including one against the largest corporation, U.S. Steel, for an acquisition that Roosevelt had personally approved. Consequently, Taft lost the support of antitrust reformers (who disliked his conservative rhetoric), of big business (which disliked his actions), and of Roosevelt, who felt humiliated by his prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>. The left wing of the Republican Party began agitating against Taft. Senator [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert LaFollette]] of [[Wisconsin]] created the National Progressive Republican League (precursor to the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)]]) to defeat the power of political bossism at the state level and to replace Taft at the national level. More trouble came when Taft fired [[Gifford Pinchot]], a leading conservationist and close ally of Roosevelt. Pinchot alleged that Taft's Secretary of Interior [[Richard Ballinger]] was in league with big timber interests. Conservationists sided with Pinchot, and Taft alienated yet another vocal constituency. 

Roosevelt, back from Europe, unexpectedly launched an attack on the federal courts, which deeply upset Taft. Roosevelt was attacking both the judiciary and the deep faith Republicans had in their judges (most of whom had been appointed by McKinley, Roosevelt or Taft.) In the 1910 Congressional elections, Democrats swept to power, and Taft's reelection in 1912 was increasingly in doubt. In 1911, Taft responded with a vigorous stumping tour that allowed him to sign up most of the party leaders long before Roosevelt announced.

===Election of 1912===
{{Main|U.S. presidential election, 1912|Progressive Party 1912 (United States)}}
[[Image:Old-friend.JPG|thumb|The battle between Taft and Roosevelt bitterly split the Republican Party; Taft's people dominated the party until 1936.]]

====Republican Primaries====
Late in 1911, Roosevelt finally broke with Taft and LaFollette and announced himself as a candidate for the Republican nomination. But Roosevelt had delayed too long, and Taft had already won the support of most party leaders in the country. Because of LaFollette's nervous breakdown on the campaign trail before Roosevelt's entry, most of LaFollette's supporters went over to Roosevelt, the new progressive Republican candidate.

Roosevelt, stepping up his attack on judges, carried nine of the states with preferential primaries, LaFollette took two, and Taft only one. The 1912 Primaries represented the first extensive use of the Presidential Primary, a reform achievement of the progressive movement. However, these primary elections, while demonstrating Roosevelt's popularity with the electorate, were in no ways as important as primaries are today. First of all, there were fewer states where the common voter was given a forum to express himself, such as a primary.  Many more states selected convention delegates either at party conventions, or in caucuses, which were not as open as today's caucuses.  So while the man in the street still adored Roosevelt, most professional Republican politicians were supporting Taft, and they proved difficult to upset in non-primary states. 

====Formation of the Bull Moose Party====
At the [[Republican Convention]] in [[Chicago]], despite being the incumbent, Taft's victory was not immediately assured.  But after two weeks, Roosevelt, realizing he would not be able to win the nomination outright, asked his followers to leave the convention hall.  They moved to the [[Auditorium Building, Chicago|Auditorium Theatre]], and then Roosevelt, along with key allies such as [[Pinchot]] and [[Albert Beveridge]] created the [[Progressive Party 1912 (United States)|Progressive Party]], structuring it as a permanent organization that would field complete tickets at the presidential and state level. It was popularly known as the "[[Bull Moose Party]]," which got its name after Roosevelt told reporters, "I'm as fit as a bull moose."<ref>Carl M. Cannon, ''The Pursuit of Happiness in Times of War'', Rowman & Littlefield: 2003, p. 142. ISBN 0742525929.</ref> At the convention Roosevelt cried out, "We stand at [[Armageddon]] and we battle for the Lord." Roosevelt's platform echoed his 1907<U+2013>08 proposals, calling for vigorous government intervention to protect the people from the selfish interests.<ref>Thayer, Chapter XXII, pp. 25&ndash;31.</ref>

====Assassination Attempt====
[[Image:TR Assissination Bullet Damage.jpg|thumb|left|The bullet-damaged speech and eyeglass case on display at the Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace]]
[[Image:Mercy Hospital.jpg|thumb|[[Mercy Hospital and Medical Center|Mercy Hospital]]: 2537 S. [[Prairie Avenue]] (1910) <small>(where  Roosevelt went after [[1912-10-14]] shooting)</small>]]
While Roosevelt was campaigning in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], on [[October 14]], [[1912]], a saloonkeeper named [[John Schrank]] shot him, but the bullet lodged in his chest only after penetrating both his steel eyeglass case and passing through a thick (50 pages) single-folded copy of the speech he was carrying in his jacket.<ref>[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/artifacts/archives/001692.asp Wisconsin Historical Society]</ref> Roosevelt, as an experienced hunter and anatomist, correctly decided that since he wasn't coughing blood the bullet had not completely penetrated the chest wall to his lung, and so declined suggestions he go to the hospital immediately. Instead, he delivered his scheduled speech with blood seeping into his shirt.<ref>[http://www.doctorzebra.com/prez/z_x26a_g.htm Medical History of American Presidents]</ref> He spoke for ninety minutes. His opening comments to the gathered crowd were, "I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot; but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose."<ref>[http://www.historybuff.com/library/refteddy.html Excerpt from the [[Detroit Free Press]]], at Historybuff.com</ref> Afterwards, probes and X-ray showed that the bullet had traversed three inches (76 mm)  of tissue and lodged in Roosevelt's chest muscle but did not penetrate the [[pleura]], and it would be more dangerous to attempt to remove the bullet than to leave it in place.  Roosevelt carried it with him until he died.<ref>[http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/timeline.htm Roosevelt Timeline]</ref>

Due to the bullet wound, Roosevelt was taken off the campaign trail in the final weeks of the race (which ended election day, November 5). Though the other two campaigners stopped their own campaigns in the week Roosevelt was in the hospital, they resumed it once he was released. The overall effect of the shooting was uncertain. Roosevelt for many reasons failed to move enough Republicans in his direction. He did win 4.1 million votes (27%), compared to Taft's 3.5 million (23%). However, Wilson's 6.3 million votes (42%) were enough to garner 435 electoral votes. Roosevelt had 88 electoral votes to Taft's 8 electoral votes.  (This meant that Taft became the only incumbent President in history to actually come in ''third'' place in an attempt to be re-elected.)  But [[Pennsylvania]] was Roosevelt's only [[Eastern United States|Eastern]] state; in the [[Midwest]] he carried [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]] and [[South Dakota]]; in the [[Western United States|West]], [[California]] and [[Washington]]; he did not win any Southern states. Although he lost, he won more votes than former presidents [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[Millard Fillmore]] who also ran again and also lost. More important, he pulled so many progressives out of the Republican party that it took on a much more conservative cast for the next generation.

===1913<U+2013>1914 South American Expedition===
[[Image:River-doubt-team.jpg|right|thumb|The initial party. From left to right (seated): [[John Augustine Zahm|Father Zahm]], [[C<U+00E2>ndido Rondon|Rondon]], [[Kermit Roosevelt|Kermit]], Cherrie, Miller, four Brazilians, Roosevelt, Fiala. Only Roosevelt, Kermit, Cherrie, Rondon and the Brazilians traveled down the River of Doubt.]]
Roosevelt's popular book ''Through the Brazilian Wilderness'' describes his expedition into the [[Brazil]]ian jungle in 1913 as a member of the [[Roosevelt-Rondon Scientific Expedition]] co-named after its leader, [[Brazil]]ian explorer [[C<U+00E2>ndido Rondon]]. The book describes all of the scientific discovery, scenic tropical vistas and exotic flora, fauna and wild life experienced on the expedition. A friend, Father [[John Augustine Zahm]], had searched for new adventures and found them in the forests of South America. After a briefing of several of his own expeditions, he convinced Roosevelt to commit to such an expedition in 1912. To finance the expedition, Roosevelt received support from the [[American Museum of Natural History]], promising to bring back many new animal specimens. Once in South America, a new far more ambitious goal was added: to find the headwaters of the Rio da Duvida, the [[River of Doubt]], and trace it north to the Madeira and thence to the [[Amazon River]]. It was later renamed [[Rio Roosevelt]] (Rio Teodoro today, 640 km long) in honor of the former President. Roosevelt's crew consisted of his 24-year-old son Kermit, Colonel [[C<U+00E2>ndido Rondon]], a naturalist sent by the [[American Museum of Natural History]] named George K. Cherrie, Brazilian Lieutenant Joao Lyra, team physician Dr. Jos<U+00E9> Antonio Cajazeira, and sixteen highly skilled paddlers (called camaradas in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]). The initial expedition started, probably unwisely, on [[December 9]], [[1913]], at the height of the rainy season. The trip down the River of Doubt started on [[February 27]], [[1914]]. 

[[Image:TR & Rondon River of Doubt in Canoe 1913.jpg|thumb|left|Roosevelt, wearing sun helmet, barely survived an expedition in 1913 into the Amazonian rain forest to trace the River of Doubt later named the [[Rio Roosevelt]].]]
During the trip down the river, Roosevelt contracted [[malaria]] and a serious infection resulting from a minor leg wound. These illnesses so weakened Roosevelt that, by six weeks into the expedition, he had to be attended day and night by the expedition's physician, Dr. Cajazeira, and his son, Kermit. By this time, Roosevelt considered his own condition a threat to the survival of the others. At one point, Kermit had to talk him out of his wish to be left behind so as not to slow down the expedition, now with only a few weeks rations left. Roosevelt was having chest pains when he tried to walk, his temperature soared to 103 <U+00B0>F (39 <U+00B0>C), and at times he was delirious.  He had lost over fifty pounds (20 kg). Without the constant support of his son, Kermit, Dr. Cajazeira, and the continued leadership of Colonel Rondon, Roosevelt would likely have perished.  Despite his concern for Roosevelt, Rondon had been slowing down the pace of the expedition by his dedication to his own map-making and other geographical goals that demanded regular stops to fix the expedition's position via sun-based survey.

Upon his return to New York, friends and family were startled by Roosevelt's physical appearance and fatigue. Roosevelt wrote to a friend that the trip had cut his life short by ten years. He might not have really known just how accurate that analysis would prove to be, because the effects of the South America expedition had so greatly weakened him that they significantly contributed to his declining health. For the rest of his life, he would be plagued by flareups of malaria and leg inflammations so severe that they would require hospitalization.<ref name="lion"/><ref>Thayer, Chapter XXIII, pp. 4<U+2013>7.</ref> 

When Roosevelt had recovered enough of his strength, he found that he had a new battle on his hands. In professional circles, there was doubt about his claims of having discovered and navigated a completely uncharted river over 625 miles (1,000 km) long. Roosevelt would have to defend himself and win international recognition of the expedition's newly-named [[Rio Roosevelt]]. Toward this end, Roosevelt went to Washington, D.C., and spoke at a standing-room-only convention to defend his claims. His official report and its defense silenced the critics, and he was able to triumphantly return to his home in [[Oyster Bay]].

Despite his weakened condition and slow recovery from his South America expedition, Roosevelt continued to write with passion on subjects ranging from foreign policy to the importance of the national park system. As an editor of ''Outlook'' magazine, he had weekly access to a large, educated national audience. In all, Roosevelt wrote about 18 books (each in several editions), including his ''Autobiography'', ''Rough Riders'' and ''History of the Naval War of 1812'', ranching, explorations, and wildlife. His most ambitious book was the 4 volume narrative ''The Winning of the West,'' which attempted to connect the origin of a new "race" of Americans (i.e. what he considered the present population of the United States to be) to the frontier conditions their ancestors endured in throughout the 17th, 18th, and early 19th centuries.

===Later years and death===
{{see also|Roosevelt's World War I volunteers}}
Roosevelt angrily complained about the foreign policy of President Wilson, calling it "weak." This caused him to develop an intense dislike for Woodrow Wilson. When [[World War I]] began in 1914, Roosevelt strongly supported the [[Allies of World War I]] and demanded a harsher policy against [[Germany]], especially regarding submarine warfare. In 1916, he campaigned energetically for [[Charles Evans Hughes]] and repeatedly denounced Irish-Americans and German-Americans who Roosevelt said were unpatriotic because they put the interest of Ireland and Germany ahead of America's by supporting neutrality. He insisted one had to be 100% American, not a "[[hyphenated American]]" who juggled multiple loyalties. When the U.S. entered the war in 1917, Roosevelt sought to raise a volunteer infantry division, but Wilson refused.<ref>Brands 781<U+2013>4; Cramer, C.H. ''Newton D. Baker'' (1961) 110<U+2013>113</ref>

Roosevelt's attacks on Wilson helped the Republicans win control of Congress in the off-year elections of 1918. Roosevelt was popular enough to seriously contest the 1920 Republican nomination, but his health was broken by 1918, because of the lingering malaria. His son [[Quentin Roosevelt|Quentin]], a daring pilot with the American forces in France, was shot down behind German lines in 1918. Quentin was his youngest son and probably the most liked by him. It is said the death of his son distressed him so much that Roosevelt never recovered from his loss.<ref>Dalton, (2002)p 507</ref>

Despite his debilitating diseases, Roosevelt remained active to the end of his life. He was an enthusiastic proponent of the [[Scouting]] movement. The [[Boy Scouts of America]] gave him the title of '''Chief Scout Citizen''', the only person to hold such title. One early Scout leader said, "The two things that gave Scouting great impetus and made it very popular were the uniform and Teddy Roosevelt's jingoism."<ref>Larson, Keith (2006).

Roosevelt intensely disliked being called "Teddy," and was quick to point out this fact to those who used the nickname, though it would become widely used by newspapers during his political career. He attended the [[Madison Square Presbyterian Church]] until the age of 16. Later in life, when Roosevelt lived at Oyster Bay he attended an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] church with his wife. While in Washington he attended services at [[Grace Reformed Church]].<ref>[http://www.adherents.com/people/pr/Theodore_Roosevelt.html "The Religious Affiliation of Theodore Roosevelt U.S. President"]. Retrieved [[March 7]] [[2006]].</ref> As President he firmly believed in the [[separation of church and state]] and thought it unwise to have ''[[In God We Trust]]'' on currency, because he thought it sacrilegious to put the name of the Deity on something so common as money.<ref>Reynolds, Ralph C.

Retrieved [[March 7]] [[2006]].</ref> He was also a [[Freemason]], and regularly attended the Matinecock Lodge's meetings. He once said that "One of the things that so greatly attracted me to Masonry that I hailed the chance of becoming a Mason was that it really did act up to what we, as a government, are pledged to &mdash; namely to treat each man on his merit as a man."<ref>Matinecock Masonic Historical Society.

Roosevelt had a lifelong interest in pursuing what he called, in an 1899 speech, "[[The Strenuous Life|the strenuous life]]." To this end, he exercised regularly and took up boxing, tennis, hiking, rowing, polo, and horseback riding. As governor of New York, he boxed with sparring partners several times a week, a practice he regularly continued as President until one blow detached his left retina, leaving him blind in that eye (a fact not made public until many years later). Thereafter, he practiced [[jujutsu]] and continued his habit of [[skinny-dipping]] in the [[Potomac River]] during winter.<ref>Thayer, Chapter XVII, pp. 22&ndash;24.</ref><ref>Shaw, K.B. & Maiden, David (2006).

[[Image:MtRushmore TR close.jpg|thumb|left|Roosevelt's face on [[Mt. Rushmore]]]]

For his gallantry at San Juan Hill, Roosevelt's commanders recommended him for the [[Medal of Honor]], but his subsequent telegrams to the War Department complaining about the delays in returning American troops from [[Cuba]] doomed his chances. In the late 1990s, Roosevelt's supporters again took up the flag on his behalf and overcame opposition from elements within the U.S. Army and the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]. On [[January 16]], [[2001]], President [[Bill Clinton]] awarded Theodore Roosevelt the Medal of Honor posthumously for his charge up San Juan Hill, Cuba, during the Spanish-American War. Roosevelt's eldest son, Brigadier General [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.]], received the Medal of Honor for heroism at the [[Battle of Normandy]] in 1944. The Roosevelts thus became one of only two father-son pairs to receive this honor.

Roosevelt's legacy includes several other important commemorations.  Roosevelt was included with [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]] at the [[Mount Rushmore|Mount Rushmore Memorial]], designed in 1927.  The [[United States Navy]] named two ships for Roosevelt: the [[USS Theodore Roosevelt (SSBN-600)]], a submarine was in commission from 1961 to 1982; and the [[USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71)]], an aircraft carrier that has been on active duty in the Atlantic Fleet since 1986.

The [[Theodore Roosevelt Association|Roosevelt Memorial Association]] (later the [[Theodore Roosevelt Association]]) or "TRA", was founded in 1920 to preserve Roosevelt's legacy. The Association preserved [[Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site|TR's birthplace]], "[[Sagamore Hill]]" home, papers, and video film. 

Among the schools, neighborhoods, and streets named in Roosevelt's honor are [[Roosevelt High School (Seattle)|Roosevelt High School]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], the surrounding [[Roosevelt, Seattle, Washington|Roosevelt neighborhood]], the district's main arterial, Roosevelt Way N.E., and Roosevelt Middle School in [[Eugene, Oregon]].

Overall, historians credit Roosevelt for changing the nation's political system by permanently placing the presidency at center stage and making character as important as the issues. His notable accomplishments include trust-busting and conservationism.  However, he has been criticized for his interventionist and imperialist approach to nations he considered "uncivilized". Even so, history and legend have been kind to him. His friend, historian [[Henry Adams]], proclaimed, "Roosevelt, more than any other living man ....showed the singular primitive quality that belongs to ultimate matter &mdash; the quality that mediaeval theology assigned to God &mdash; he was pure act." Historians typically rank Roosevelt among the top five presidents.<ref>The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia (2005).

===Popular culture===
Roosevelt's 1901 saying "Speak Softly and Carry a Big Stick" is still being occasionally quoted by politicians and columnists in different countries - not only in English but also in translation to various other languages. For example, following the [[Second Lebanon War]] of August 2006, opponents of [[Israel]]i Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] accused him of "''Speaking loudly and carrying a small stick''". 

The well-known [[Nicaragua]]n poet [[Rub<U+00E9>n Dar<U+00ED>o]] published in 1905 a poem entitled ''A Roosevelt (To Roosevelt)''<ref> http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Rub%C3%A9n_Dar%C3%ADo </ref> which was included in ''Cantos de Vida y Esperanza (Songs of Life and Hope)''

As a charismatic President often considered larger than life, Roosevelt has appeared in numerous fiction books, television shows, films, and other media of popular culture. Roosevelt was played by [[Robin Williams]] in the box office hit ''[[Night at the Museum]]'' (2006) and its upcoming sequel. 

[[Image:TheodoreRooseveltTeddyBear.jpg|thumb|right|"Drawing the Line in Mississippi," referring to Roosevelt's sparing the bear, by Clifford Berryman, 1902. ''The Washington Post'' political cartoon that spawned the Teddy bear name.]]

Filmmaker [[John Milius]] also directed two films in which Roosevelt was a central character: ''[[The Wind and the Lion]]'' (1975) in which he was played by [[Brian Keith]]; and ''[[Rough Riders (film)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997) in which he was played by [[Tom Berenger]]. Keith's performance is widely considered to be the definitive screen depiction of Roosevelt.

Roosevelt's lasting popular legacy, however, is the stuffed toy bears<U+2014>[[teddy bears]]<U+2014>named after him following an incident on a hunting trip in 1902. Roosevelt famously refused to kill a captured [[American black bear|black bear]] simply for the sake of making a kill. Bears and later bear cubs became closely associated with Roosevelt in political cartoons thereafter.<ref>[http://inventors.about.com/od/tstartinventions/a/Teddy_Bear.htm "History of the Teddy Bear"]. Retrieved [[March 7]] [[2006]].</ref>

On [[June 26]], [[2006]], Roosevelt, once again, made the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine with the lead story, "The Making of America<U+2014>Theodore Roosevelt<U+2014>The 20th Century Express": "At home and abroad, Theodore Roosevelt was the locomotive President, the man who drew his flourishing nation into the future."<ref name="natfut">{{cite web |last = |first =  |authorlink = |coauthors = |year =2006 |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1207820,00.html

The [[Washington Nationals]] major league baseball team has a fan tradition called the [[Presidents Race]]. In it four caricatures of presidents Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt race against each other. A running gag has been Theodore Roosevelt's inability to win a single Presidents Race.

==Media==
Theodore Roosevelt was one of the first presidents whose voice was recorded for posterity. Several of his recorded speeches survive.<ref>[http://www.lib.msu.edu/vincent/presidents/index.htm Vincent Voice Library] at [[Michigan State University]]. Retrieved September 23, 2007.</ref>
