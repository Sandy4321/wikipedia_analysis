The '''Cossonay<U+2013>Gare<U+2013>Ville funicular''' ({{lang-fr|Funiculaire Cossonay<U+2013>Gare<U+2013>Ville}}) is a [[funicular railway]] connecting the town of [[Cossonay]] in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] canton of [[Vaud]] with [[Cossonay railway station]], on the line from [[Lausanne]] to [[Vallorbe]] and [[Yverdon-les-Bains]]. The lower funicular station is called Cossonay-Gare, but is in the village of Penthalaz. The upper station, some {{convert|130|m}} above, is named Cossonay-Ville .<ref name=funimag>{{cite web | url = http://www.funimag.com/suisse/cossonay01.htm | title = CG - Cossonay Gare-Ville | publisher = Funimag | accessdate = 2011-10-13}}</ref>

The line was opened in 1897, and was initially operated as a water counterbalance funicular. In 1969, the line was automated, still as a water counterbalance funicular. In 1982, the line was rebuilt and converted to electric operation, with new cabins and stations.<ref name=funimag/> Another renewal is under way in 2012/13 and a replacement bus operates the connection.<ref>[http://www.fahrplanfelder.ch/en/welcome/ Official timetable of Switzerland] 2013, timetable number 2003</ref>

== Operation ==
The ''Compagnie du Chemin de fer Funiculaire de la Gare <U+00E0> la Ville de Cossonay '', after a name change in 2003 ''Funiculaire de la Gare <U+00E0> la Ville de Cossonay SA'', was founded in 1892. In 2010 the company was merged<ref>[http://www.rc2.vd.ch/registres/hrcintapp-pub/externalCompanyReport.action?companyOfrcId13=CH-550-0100600-2&ofrcLanguage=1 Registre du Commerce du Canton de Vaud]</ref> into the [[Transports de la r<U+00E9>gion Morges-Bi<U+00E8>re-Cossonay]], which had assumed operation already before, but then on behalf of the original owner company. The funicular is completely automatic and has the following parameters:<ref name=funimag/><ref name=liftdb>{{cite web | title = Cossonay - Gare<U+2013>Ville | url = http://www.seilbahntechnik.net/en/lifts/3955/datas.htm | publisher =  Lift-World.info | accessdate = 2011-08-08}}</ref>
