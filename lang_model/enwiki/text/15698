'''Suffolk Downs''', a [[thoroughbred]] [[race track]] in [[East Boston, Massachusetts]], [[United States]] opened in 1935. Famous horses that have raced at this track include [[Seabiscuit]], [[Whirlaway]], [[Funny Cide]] and [[Cigar (horse)|Cigar]]. The [[MassCap]] is held there, as well at the annual [[Hot dog day#Boston Hot Dog Safari|Hot Dog Safari]]. The track is a one-mile dirt oval with a seven-furlong inner turf track.

==History==
The track was founded in 1935 after [[pari-mutuel]] wagering was legalized in [[Massachusetts]]. The first MassCap was held that year. The track raced through [[World War II]]. On 18 August 1966,<ref name=moskowitz>{{cite web

In 1992, this was resolved when a deal was brokered between Suffolk Downs and [[Rockingham Park]]. In 1995 the Massachusetts Handicap returned from a six-year hiatus with a victory by Cigar.  The track is conveniently accessed by public transportation via the [[Suffolk Downs (MBTA station)|Suffolk Downs MBTA subway station]] on the [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]]. In 2007, the track had an influx of new ownership, vowing to improve the success and future of Suffolk Downs.

In 2008, Suffolk Downs became the first race track in the country to implement a zero-tolerance policy toward those who slaughter horses.  The policy states that if a horse from Suffolk Downs is sold for slaughter, the trainer and owner of that horse will be barred from the grounds for life.
