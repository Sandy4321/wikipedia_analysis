'''Illarion Ivanovich Ivanov-Schitz''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0418><U+043B><U+043B><U+0430><U+0440><U+0438><U+043E><U+043D> <U+0418><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+0418><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432>-<U+0428><U+0438><U+0446>}}, 1865 - 1937) was a [[Russia]]n [[architect]], notable for developing a unique personal style, blending [[Vienna Secession]] school of [[Otto Wagner]] with [[Greek Revival]] features. His career peaked in [[1902]]-[[1912]] with such buildings as the Morozov Hospital, Merchant Club ([[Lenkom Theatre]]), Moscow Savings Bank and the public buildings in [[Miusskaya Square]]. He was one of the few architects born in [[1860s]] who integrated in [[Soviet]] establishment, earning [[Order of Lenin]] for various resort projects and rebuilding interiors of [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] in [[1930s]].

==Biography==
====Education====

Ivanov-Schitz graduated [[Saint Petersburg]] Institute of Civil Engineers ([[1883]]-[[1888]]) with golden medal; after a brief tour of [[Europe]], he relocated to Moscow, joining the firm of [[Max Hoppener]] and later working for the City of Moscow. Another visit to Europe, in [[1893]], exposed him to [[Otto Wagner]] and his circle that would become [[Vienna Secession]] in [[1897]].

====Early career====

His first materialized design, co-signed by [[Vladimir Sherwood]] (Jr.), has been a [[1889]] apartment building at 32, [[Tverskaya Street]] (destroyed). Early own works, like the orphanage in [[Devichye Pole]] ([[1893]], now housing Embassy of [[Vietnam]]), belong to traditional 19th century [[eclecticism]] and do not stand out among hundreds of similar buildings. Over the first decade of his career, Ivanov-Schitz gradually migrated into [[Greek Revival]]. Collaboration with [[Lev Kekushev]] on his railroad projects and public buildings also exposed Ivanov-Schitz to practical application of Kekushev's Belgian variety of [[Art Nouveau]].

====Mature works====

In [[1898]]-[[1900]] he completed his first landmark building, an office block on the corner of [[Kuznetsky Most]] and [[Petrovka Street]] ([http://mosmodern.race.ru/d005.html]). This building, dominated with vertical ribs, was a clear departure from eclecticism. Despite citations from Greek legacy, it was regarded as unusually modern for his period; professionals called it "A Greek sort of Wagner" (Nachokina, p.223).

Around [[1902]]-[[1903]], he formulated his own style, a modest blend of Secession and Greek revival. Unlike the extravagant Belgian [[Art Nouveau]] practiced by Kekushev, Ivanov's art appealed equally to financial institutions and charities; in fact, most of his works belong to these two groups of clients:
* [[1900]]-[[1905]] Morozov Hospital
* [[1902]]-[[1903]] Moscow Savings Bank
* [[1903]]-[[1906]] Abrikosov's Nursery in [[Miusskaya Square]] [http://mosmodern.race.ru/o004.html]
* [[1903]]-[[1906]] Vvedensky People's House (destroyed, present-day Zhuravlev Square)

After the revolution of [[1905]], his buildings become more rationalist, yet they clearly belong to the same style:
* [[1907]]-[[1908]] Merchant Club (present-day Lenkom Theatre) 
* [[1910]]-[[1912]] Shanyavsky University in [[Miusskaya Square]] 
* [[1910]]-[[1914]] Courses for the Women in [[Devichye Pole]] 

====Soviet period====

In [[1908]]-[[1928]] Ivanov-Schitz was officially employed as the architect of [[Botkin Hospital]] in Moscow. He continued active construction work, engaged in various consultancied for the [[Bolshevik]]s and blended well into the new establishment. In [[1922]]-[[1925]], when most architects were unemployed, he had real construction jobs, expanding apartment buildings in [[Tverskoy Boulevard]] and the Eye Hospital on the [[Garden Ring]].

In [[1930s]], Ivanov-Schitz was a lead architect for the Medical-Sanitary Board (<U+041B><U+0435><U+0447><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D><U+0443><U+043F><U+0440>), a state institution that catered for the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] elite. He completed various high-profile resorts in [[Sochi]] and [[Barvikha]] and was allowed to rebuild the halls of [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] so it could seat the assemblies of [[Supreme Soviet]]; in [[1990s]], his alterations were torn down and the Palace rebuilt to the original plans of [[Konstantin Thon]].

Illarion Ivanov-Schitz, recipient of [[Order of Lenin]], died in [[1937]] and was buried with honours at [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow.
