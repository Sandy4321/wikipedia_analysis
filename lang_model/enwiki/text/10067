The song is a duet with [[soul music|soul]] singer [[Chaka Khan]]. The song received a full [[Music download|digital download]] single release on 8 March 2010<ref>[http://www.beverleyknight.com/news/new-tour-dates-new-single.html BeverleyKnight.com - New Dates....New Single]</ref>. There are two versions of the song, the album version and the radio edit, which halves verse one of the song.

On 10 February 2010, the radio edit of the single was added to the [[BBC Radio 2]] playlist, entering on the B-list. On 24 February 2010, it was announced that "Soul Survivor" had climbed to the Radio 2 A-list, Knight's first single to be placed there since the single "[[After You (song)|After You]]" was released in 2007 <ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/music/playlist/next-week/ BBC - Radio 2 - Playlist]</ref>.

==Background and Production==

"Soul Survivor" was co-written by Knight, [[Guy Chambers]] and Chaka Khan with production by Kevin Bacon and Jonathan Quarmby <ref>[http://uk.real.com/music/blog/2009/07/17/beverley-knight-interview-free-download Real Interview]</ref>. The song was originally written with [[Tina Turner]] in mind, as a testament to her longevity. However, upon recording it Beverley loved it so much that she decided to keep it and record it with Chaka Khan. Knight says "We both see ourselves as soul survivors, we have rode through the ups and downs of our musical careers, and we are both still here and loving it" <ref>[http://www.beverleyknight.com/news/track-by-track-in-bevs-own-words.html Track-by-track in Bev's own words - Soul Survivor]</ref>.

Knight also commented:

<blockquote>
"When me and Guy first wrote this song I recorded it alone initially, but I knew there was another dimension to it - and Chaka was that dimension! She's incredible. Everyone knows there are ebbs and flows in a career in the music industry. That's what this song is about. People fall in and out of favour all the time. The thing that gets you through is the love of what you do." <ref>[http://www.beverleyknight.com/news/soul-survivor-the-brand-new-single.html Soul Survivor! The Brand New Single]</ref>.
</blockquote>

==Critical reception==

In a review of "100%", David Quantick of the [[BBC]] stated:

<blockquote>
And the stand-out moment, Soul Survivor, is built to resemble the Big Song from an 80s movie (so much that it even has big chunky synths and the presence of the great Chaka Khan) before working its way through most genres of soul (there<U+2019>s even a great Fauxtown bridge).<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/gnqv BBC - Music - Review of Beverley Knight - 100%]</ref>
</blockquote>

The music video for "Soul Survivor" premiered on Knight's [[YouTube]] page on 3 February 2010. It is a live performance video taken from the [[Sheffield]] date of her ''100% UK Tour''.
