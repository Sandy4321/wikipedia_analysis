==Early life==
Iginla was born in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], July 1, 1977.

In addition to hockey, Iginla played [[baseball]] as a young man and was the [[catcher]] on the Canadian National Junior team.<ref name="Blaze1129" />  He grew up admiring other black hockey players, including [[Edmonton Oilers]] [[goaltender]] [[Grant Fuhr]].  Emulating Fuhr, Iginla played goaltender in his first two years of organized hockey before switching to the [[Winger (hockey)|right wing]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Amber |first=David |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?id=2205382 |title=Facing Off: Q&A with Jarome Iginla |publisher=ESPN |date=2005-10-28 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref>  He played his entire minor hockey career in St. Albert, leading the [[Alberta Midget Hockey League]] in scoring as a 15-year-old with 87&nbsp;points for the St. Albert Midget Raiders in 1992<U+2013>93.<ref name="Blaze1129" />

==Junior career==
Iginla played three years with the [[Kamloops Blazers]] of the [[Western Hockey League]] (WHL).  As a 16-year-old in [[1993<U+2013>94 WHL season|1993<U+2013>94]], he recorded six goals and 29&nbsp;points in 48 regular season games before playing an additional 19 in the playoffs.<ref name="LOH">{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=10613 |title=Player Profile<U+2014>Jarome Iginla |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref>  The Blazers captured both the [[Ed Chynoweth Cup|league title]] and the [[1994 Memorial Cup|1994]] [[Memorial Cup]], Canada's national junior championship.<ref>{{Cite book|editor=Flett, Cory and Watts, Jessie|title=2008<U+2013>09 WHL Guide|publisher=Western Hockey League|page=206}}</ref>  In reference to the Blazers' dominance of the league at the time (they had won their third WHL title in five seasons), Iginla described the expectations of success as being similar to those placed the [[Montreal Canadiens]], the NHL's most successful franchise: "When you put on a Blazers jersey, it's like putting on the Canadiens'.

The [[Dallas Stars]] selected Iginla with their first round selection, 11th overall, in the [[1995 NHL Entry Draft]]; however, on December 20, 1995, they traded him to the [[Calgary Flames]], along with [[Corey Millen]], for forward [[Joe Nieuwendyk]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Flames bank on future |work=Calgary Herald |date=1995-12-21 |page=C1}}</ref>

==NHL career==
[[Image:Iginla warming up.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Iginla warming up before a game in March 2006.]]
Iginla made his NHL debut in the [[1996 Stanley Cup Playoffs]], as he was signed to a contract and flown to Calgary immediately after his junior season ended in Kamloops.  He appeared in two games for the Flames in their series against the [[Chicago Blackhawks]].  In doing so, he became the first 18-year-old to play for the Flames since [[Dan Quinn]] in 1983.<ref>{{cite news |title='Iguana' enjoys heat |last=Board |first=Mike |work=Calgary Herald |date=1996-04-22 |page=D3}}</ref>  In his first NHL game, Iginla assisted on a [[Theoren Fleury]] goal to record his first point;<ref>{{cite news |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=A quick learner |work=Calgary Herald |date=1996-04-23 |page=D1}}</ref> he scored his first goal in his second game.<ref>{{cite news |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Heartbreak |work=Calgary Herald |date=1996-04-24 |page=C1}}</ref>  He remained with the Flames, and played his first NHL season in [[1996<U+2013>97 NHL season|1996<U+2013>97]].  He earned a spot on that year's [[NHL All-Rookie Team]] and finished as the runner-up to [[Bryan Berard]] in voting for the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] as rookie of the year after leading all first-year players in scoring with 50&nbsp;points.<ref name="0809MediaGuide">{{cite book |title=2008<U+2013>09 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean |pages=59<U+2013>61 |url=http://downloads.flames.nhl.com/other/2008CalgaryFlamesMediaGuide_web.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

By his third season, [[1998<U+2013>99 NHL season|1998<U+2013>99]], Iginla led the Flames in goals with 28.<ref name="0809MediaGuide" />  His success complicated negotiations for a new contract, as he and the Flames struggled to agree on a new deal following the season.  Hoping to help resolve the contract impasse, he agreed to attend training camp without a contract, and purchased his own insurance as the team would not have been responsible financially if he suffered an injury.  He remained without a contract at the start of the [[1999<U+2013>2000 NHL season|1999<U+2013>00 season]] and missed the first three games as a holdout before signing a deal worth [[United States dollar|US$]]4.9 million, plus bonuses.<ref name="0809MediaGuide" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Board |first=Mike |title=Iginla signs 3-year deal |work=Calgary Herald |date=1999-10-09 |page=E1}}</ref>  He finished the year with career highs in goals (29) and points (63).

After participating in Canada's Olympic summer camp before the season, Iginla again set new personal highs in [[2001<U+2013>02 NHL season|2001<U+2013>02]] when he registered 52&nbsp;goals and 96&nbsp;points. This season elevated Iginla to superstar status.<ref>{{cite web |last=Allen |first=Kevin |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/columns/allen/2002-03-05-allen.htm |title=Iginla ready to break the bank |work=USA Today |date=2002-03-05 |accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref>  He earned the [[Art Ross Trophy|Art Ross]] and [[Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy|Maurice Richard]] trophies as the NHL's leading point and goal scorer, respectively.<ref name="0809MediaGuide" />  He was also awarded the [[Lester B.

The Hart Trophy voting proved to be controversial: Iginla tied Canadiens goaltender [[Jos<U+00E9> Th<U+00E9>odore]] in voting points, but received fewer first place votes than Th<U+00E9>odore.<ref>{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Cecil |title=Breaking the Ice: The Black Experience in Professional Hockey |publisher=Insomniac Press |year=2003 |ISBN=1-894663-58-6 |page=20}}</ref> However, one voter, rumoured to be from [[Quebec]]<U+2014>Th<U+00E9>odore and the Canadiens' home province<U+2014>inexplicably left Iginla off his ballot.

Iginla first represented Canada at the 1994 [[Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament|Nations Cup]], an unsanctioned tournament for players under the age of 18.  He led Canada in scoring with five goals and nine points as it won the gold medal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hockeycanada.ca/4/2/2/0/index1.shtml |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060514092829/http://www.hockeycanada.ca/4/2/2/0/index1.shtml |title=La Copa Mexico 1994 |publisher=Hockey Canada |archivedate=2006-05-14 |accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref>  Two years later, he joined the [[Canada men's national junior ice hockey team|national junior team]] at the [[1996 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]].

He was named an all-star and the tournament's top forward.<ref name="TSN-WJHC" /><ref name="Blaze1129" />  One year later, Iginla played in his first tournament with the [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|senior team]], competing at the [[1997 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|1997 World Championships]] as a 19-year-old, the youngest player on the team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hockeycanada.ca/index.php/ci_id/4722/la_id/1.htm |title=1997 IIHF World Championship |publisher=Hockey Canada |accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref>  He recorded two goals and three assists in 11&nbsp;games as Canada won the gold medal.<ref name="LOH" />

An invitation to join Team Canada at the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]] helped Iginla emerge as a star player.  He scored two goals in the gold medal game, a 5<U+2013>2 victory over the [[United States men's national ice hockey team|United States]], as Canada won its first Olympic gold medal in 50&nbsp;years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2002/ice_hockey/news/2002/02/24/usa_canada_ap/ |title=Stand on guard for thee |publisher=CNN Sports Illustrated |date=2002-02-24 |accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref> He also represented Canada at the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]], playing on a line with [[Joe Sakic]] and [[Mario Lemieux]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1877692 |title=Brodeur nabs first shutout of World Cup |publisher=ESPN |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2009-01-02}}</ref> where Canada again won the gold medal.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lapointe |first=Joe |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/15/sports/hockey/15hockey.html?pagewanted=print&position= |title=Canada's Cup Victory May End Up Half Empty |work=The New York Times |date=2004-09-15 |accessdate=2009-01-02}}</ref>

==Playing style==
[[File:Iginla v Lecavalier.JPG|thumb|left|Iginla faces off against [[Vincent Lecavalier]].]]
Iginla is considered to be one of the NHL's pre-eminent [[Power forward (ice hockey)|power forwards]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Nichols |first=Chris |url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/2008/09/18/nichols_power_forwards/ |title=NHL Power Brokers |publisher=Rogers Sportsnet |date=2008-09-18 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref>  Upon entering the league, he tried to emulate players like [[Brendan Shanahan]] and [[Keith Tkachuk]], hoping to match their combination of finesse and physicality.<ref name="Impact" />  He is one of the most consistent scorers in the league; between 1998 and 2008, only [[Jarom<U+00ED>r J<U+00E1>gr]] scored more NHL goals than Iginla.<ref name="Consistency">{{cite web |last=Cruikshank |first=Scott |url=http://www2.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/sports/story.html?id=7f057796-13e3-4995-b54c-5a5028b0d108 |title=Iginla's scoring consistency amazes most |work=Saskatoon Star-Phoenix |date=2008-01-04 |accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref> Even so, scouting reports have argued that Iginla's lack of speed makes it easier for opponents to isolate him and restrict his ability to move if his teammates rely on him too much to lead the offence.<ref name="TSN2004Bio">{{cite news |last=Yorio |first=Kara |title=Scouting Report: Jarome Iginla, RW, Calgary Flames |work=The Sporting News |date=2004-03-15 |volume=228 |issue=11 |page=61}}</ref>

The abuse he faced at the hands of opponents early in his NHL career prompted Iginla's coaches to work at developing his physical play.  While he was not enthusiastic about fighting, Iginla accepted then head coach [[Brian Sutter]]'s arguments that he needed to adopt a more aggressive style to improve as a player.  Iginla is most effective when he has room to manoeuvre, and to create that space, he had to intimidate his opponents.<ref>{{cite news |last=Maki |first=Allan |title=Sutter tries to light flame under Iginla |work=Globe and Mail |date=1998-10-16 |page=S5}}</ref>  The lessons Iginla learned have carried throughout his career.   "You've got a power forward who does it all," said [[Craig Conroy]]. "I mean, he'll fight, and hit, and score goals.  Maybe it's not the end-to-end rushes, but he does all those little things that win games and get things done."<ref name="Avery">{{cite web |last=Hall |first=Vicki |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/sports/story.html?id=717c5c54-855e-42cd-9d43-d02fba8080bc |title=Avery takes jab at Iginla |work=Calgary Herald |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref> His opponents also respect his play.  [[Rob Blake]] said that while Iginla is not known for fancy play, "he'll run you over. Or he'll fight somebody. And then he'll score a goal. He does pretty much everything you'd want a guy to do."<ref name="Consistency" />

Iginla has recorded several [[Gordie Howe hat trick]]s.<ref name="0809MediaGuide" /> His fights, including on with Tampa Bay star [[Vincent Lecavalier]] in the [[2004 Stanley Cup Finals]], have had a motivating effect on his play and that of his teammates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs2004/news/story?id=1812373 |title=Calgary wins with intensity, goaltending |publisher=ESPN |date=2004-05-30 |accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref>  Iginla has suffered injuries as a result of his fighting, including a broken hand from a 2003 fight with [[Bill Guerin]] of the [[Dallas Stars]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Maki |first=Allan |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/article734282.ece |title=Iginla says fight not to blame for injured knee |work=Globe and Mail |accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref>  His physical style of play also leads to a greater risk of persistent injuries and [[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalties]].<ref name="TSN2004Bio" />

He commands the respect of his peers, and has been known to stand up to the coaching staff to defend a fellow player.  Former teammate [[Andrew Ference]] once described following Iginla as like "following a friend".<ref name="Consistency" /> Preferring to lead by example, Iginla is not regarded as a vocal captain.  He likes to speak with players individually, and tries to ensure that all of his teammates are comfortable.<ref name="Captain" />  He was named a finalist for the [[Mark Messier Leadership Award]] in 2009, along with [[Sidney Crosby]] and [[Zdeno Ch<U+00E1>ra]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/sports/story.html?id=1654916 |title=Iginla, Chara, Crosby up for leadership award |work=National Post |date=2009-06-03 |accessdate=2009-06-03}}</ref>

== Off the ice ==
Iginla married his high school sweetheart, Kara, and the couple has three children: Jade, Tij and Joe.  They had been dating since they were in the eighth grade.<ref name="Blaze1129" />  He has two brothers, Jason and Stephen, and two sisters, Theresa and Elizabeth.<ref>{{cite book |last=Elicksen |first=Debbie |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=xiekI_Yuph8C&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&dq=Jarome+Iginla+NHL+diversity&source=bl&ots=clt-QxOlW8&sig=Eti3ubLyIf3VKZrZUQbVFSeaBBg&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPA6,M1 |title=Positive Sports |publisher=Freelance Communications |date=2003 |page=90 |ISBN=0973023732}}</ref>  He is an avid golfer and a regular participant in the Calgary Flames Celebrity Charity Golf Classic.<ref name="Blaze1129" />

He is well known for his kind-hearted nature.  Former Flames general manager [[Craig Button]] described Iginla as being grounded: "he doesn't carry himself with any attitude or arrogance. He's confident in his abilities. He's self-assured. He's genuine. He's a better person than he is a player, and we all know what kind of player he is."<ref>{{cite web |last=Ross |first=Sherry |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2002/10/06/2002-10-06_fanning_the_flames__jarome_i.html |title=Jarome Iginla becoming hottest ticket in Canada |work=New York Daily News |date=2002-10-06 |accessdate=2009-01-02}}</ref>  In 2002, while in [[Salt Lake City]] for the [[2002 Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympic Games]], Iginla struck up a conversation with four Calgarians sitting next to his table, and found out they were sleeping in their car outside of the hotel. He excused himself from the conversation, and booked them accommodations at his own expense at the hotel his family was staying in.<ref>{{cite web |last=Francis |first=Eric |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Columnists/Francis/2007/11/30/4697730-sun.html |title=Iggy's Salt of the Earth |work=Calgary Sun |date=2007-11-03 |accessdate=2009-01-02}}</ref>

In 2000, he began donating $1,000 per goal he scored to [[KidSport]], a figure he doubled to $2,000 in 2005.  From 2000 through to the end of the 2008 season he donated $430,000 from this initiative.<ref name="Blaze1129" />
