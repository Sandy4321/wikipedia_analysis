'''Montreal West''' (French: '''Montr<U+00E9>al-Ouest''') is a town in southwestern [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] on the [[Island of Montreal]]. On [[January 1]], [[2002]] it, along with its neighboring suburbs of [[C<U+00F4>te Saint-Luc, Quebec|C<U+00F4>te Saint-Luc]] and [[Hampstead, Quebec|Hampstead]], was merged into a borough of the City of [[Montreal]] to be known as [[C<U+00F4>te-Saint-Luc<U+2014>Hampstead<U+2014>Montr<U+00E9>al-Ouest]], though 97% of the town population voted against the merger. The population voted on [[June 20]], [[2004]] to demerge and Montreal West was re-established as a town on [[January 1]], [[2006]].

Also known as "MoWest", Montreal West is a small, close-knit suburban community made up primarily of single family dwellings. The town is largely composed of young families, and has a total population of 5 332 (As of 2005). The town itself takes up 1.6 km<U+00B2>. About 85% of the population of Montreal West use English as their first language.

Montreal West is notable for having Quebec's highest rated Anglophone public high school, [[Royal West Academy]] (ranked 39th overall in 2005 by the Fraser Institute).  The town is also the home of Canada's oldest amateur [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] Opera Company, the Montreal West Operatic Society. Clay tennis courts, the Montreal West Curling Club, a swimming pool, and an indoor ice rink are also highlights of the town.

==Events==
===[[Canada Day]]===
Canada Day is the largest community event of the year in Montreal West.  Residents organize a parade route that mainly runs down the main street of Westminster and ends at Strathern Park.  Floats represented in the parade include organizations and clubs located in town, as well as some created personally by residents.
[[Image:MoWestCanadaDay.JPG|thumb|left|160px|The Montreal West Canada Day Parade making its way along Westminster Avenue]]
[[Image:MoWestRemembranceDay.JPG|thumb|right|170px|A Remembrance Day ceremony in Montreal West]]
In some years, there have been water fights between sidelined residents and members of the parade (mainly the swimming pool float).  Water fights during these years have seen [[water balloon]]s and [[super soaker]] water guns, as well as the odd hose drawn from a house.  Organizers have tried to minimize these activities in recent years so as not to detract from the parade itself, with varying success.

Following the parade, residents converge on Strathern Park for a giant picnic/BBQ.  Many children's games and activities go on at the park, as well as in the nearby Percival park.  The final event of the evening is the fireworks, which take place around 10pm at Hodgson Field.

===[[F<U+00EA>te Nationale du Qu<U+00E9>bec]]===
Annually on June 24th there is a picnic at Davies Park, featuring music performed by [[French-speaking Quebecer|Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois]] musicians. In the late evening, a large bonfire is held in the centre of the park.

===[[Garbage Bowl]]===
The Garbage Bowl is a yearly tradition held every January 1st, where men from Montreal West separate into two teams, the Northern Combines and the Southern Bombers, and play a football game in the frigid weather.  Since 1950, the teams have suited up in pajamas with proceeds from donations, food, and commemorative pins going to charity.
