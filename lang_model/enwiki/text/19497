'''''Reasonable Doubt''''' is the debut album of [[East Coast hip hop|East Coast]] [[rapper]] [[Jay-Z]], released June 25, 1996 on [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] in the United States and on [[Northwestside Records]] in the United Kingdom. The album features production by [[DJ Premier]], [[Ski (producer)|Ski]] and [[Clark Kent (producer)|Clark Kent]], and guest vocals by [[Memphis Bleek]], [[Sauce Money]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] It peaked at #23 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], received [[RIAA certification|platinum]] status in 2002,<ref name="riaa">{{cite web  | url = http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=Reasonable%20Doubt&artist=&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25 | title = RIAA Platinum and Gold Searchable Database  | publisher = [[Recording Industry Association of America]] | accessdate = July 22 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> and sold 1.4 million copies as of 2006.<ref name="billboard">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002650778|title=Jay-Z Brings Life To "Reasonable Doubt"|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=2006-06-08|accessdate=2007-06-22}}</ref> Four singles were released, the most popular being "[[Ain't No Nigga]]" and "[[Can't Knock the Hustle]]".

==Conception==
===Background===
Shawn Carter grew up in [[Brooklyn]]'s [[Marcy Houses]], a New York housing [[Public housing in the United States and Canada|project]]. Shawn's father abandoned the family when he was 11, the first of many traumas that led him to write raps.<ref name="VH1">{{cite web  | url = http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/driven/63742/episode_about.jhtml | title = Driven: About the Episode  | publisher = [[VH1]] | accessdate = July 19 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> In his neighborhood, Carter was known as "Jazzy", a nickname that developed into his stage name, "Jay-Z". The moniker is a homage to his musical mentor [[Jaz-O]] and to the [[J/Z (New York City Subway service)|J-Z subway lines]] that stop by [[Marcy Avenue (BMT Jamaica Line)|Marcy Avenue]].
Fellow Brooklynite Jazz-O gave Jay-Z his first break by recruiting him on the 1989 song "Hawaiian Sophie". Jay-Z appeared on two more Jaz-O songs in the next year, but when Jaz-O was dropped from his label [[EMI]], Jay-Z began supporting himself by dealing drugs.<ref name="VH1" /> He continued to pursue a rap career, however, and appeared on two songs from Original Flavor's 1993 album ''[[Beyond Flavor]]''. Jay-Z then caught [[Big Daddy Kane]]'s attention and began touring with him; they collaborated on Kane's 1994 [[posse cut]] "Show & Prove" along with [[Wu-Tang Clan]]'s [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]], Wu-Tang affiliate [[Shyheim]], [[Sauce Money]] & Scoob Lover.<ref name="VH1"/> Sauce Money appears on the song "Bring It On". 

Despite the exposure he received from Kane, Jay-Z was still without a record deal. He began selling tapes from his car with help from friend [[Damon Dash]].<ref name="Yahoo">{{cite web | last = Hunter | first = Asondra | url = http://music.yahoo.com/read/interview/12048673 | title = Rockin' On A Roc-A-Fella at Yahoo! Music  | publisher = Music.Yahoo.com| accessdate = July 19 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> The success of his street-level marketing led to a deal with Payday Records, which released his first solo single, "[[In My Lifetime (song)|In My Lifetime]]" and its [[B-side]] "I Can't Get wid Dat". In an unconventional move, Jay-Z then spurned the record contract he had long sought and left Payday Records to form his own label, [[Roc-A-Fella Records]], with Damon Dash and Kareem "Biggs" Burke. Jay-Z later explained that he thought he could do a better job of marketing his records on his own:

{{quote|[Payday] eventually signed me to a deal, but were acting shady the whole time, like they didn't know how to work a record or something," says Jay. "The things that they were setting up for me I could have done myself. They had me traveling places to do instores, and my product wasn't even available in the store. We shot one video, but when the time came for me to do the video for the second single, I had to be cut out. They gave me the money and I started my own company. There was a little arguing back and forth, but our conflict finally got resolved. The bottom line was they wasn't doing their job, so I had to get out of there.<ref name="Yahoo" />}}

Jay-Z rented a small, cheap office for Roc-A-Fella Records on John Street in one of the "dreariest parts of the busiest city in the world".<ref name="Yahoo" /> Jay-Z and his compatriots thought of their low-rent headquarters as a "starting point" that would eventually lead them to Manhattan.<ref name="Yahoo" /> In 1995 and early 1996, Jay-Z appeared on records by [[Big L]] and [[Mic Geronimo]], further raising his profile. At this point, he was still considered an "[[underground hip hop|underground]]"<ref name="VH1News">{{cite web | last = Reid | first = Shaheem | url = http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1535110/20060626/jay_z.jhtml | title = Jay-Z Rolls Out Classics, Big Surprises At Reasonable Doubt 10th Anniversary Show  | publisher = [[VH1]] | accessdate = July 21 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> rapper with a "new jack" style.<ref name="raprev">{{cite web|last=Juon|first= Steve|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/BTTL_reasonabledoubt.html|title=Reasonable Doubt Review|publisher=RapReviews.com|date=2001-12-12|accessdate=2007-06-22}}</ref>

===Recording sessions===
''Reasonable Doubt'' was recorded in [[the Bronx]]'s [[D&D Studios]] and [[Audio mixing|mixed]] at Platinum Island, but its beats were formed elsewhere. [[Knobody]] produced "[[Can't Knock the Hustle]]" at his mother's home in 1994 and [[Ski (producer)|Ski]] produced "[[Feelin' It]]" and "Politics as Usual" while recording with [[Camp Lo]].<ref name="xxl">{{cite web|url=http://xxlmag.com/online/?p=2477|title=The Making of Reasonable Doubt Told U So|work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL Magazine]]|date=2006-06-23|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> The recording sessions were generally dominated by competition; Ski and [[Clark Kent (producer)|Clark Kent]] created similar beats for "Politics as Usual", but Ski submitted his to Jay-Z first causing his to appear on the album.<ref name="xxl" /> "Brooklyn's Finest" was a competitive, though friendly battle between Jay-Z and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] in which Jay-Z tried proving that he is of Biggie's caliber, while Biggie tried brushing his rhymes off as insignificant.<ref name="xxl" /> Although the rappers had already met on the set for the "[[Dead Presidents (song)|Dead Presidents]]" music video, they discovered that neither write down their rhymes while recording.<ref name="xxl" /> The recording of "Brooklyn's Finest" spanned two months and moved from D&D Studios to Giant Studios where the Clark Kent-sung chorus was recorded.<ref name="xxl" /> The studio sessions affected Jay-Z mentally: as he told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', "The studio was like a [[psychiatrist]]'s couch for me".<ref name="RS500" />

==Music==
===Lyrical content===
''Reasonable Doubt'' is generally classified as [[Mafioso rap]] because of Jay-Z's prevalent references to crime within his songs. David Drake of ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' considers the lyrics to be characterized by "gritty [[Literary realism|realism]]".<ref name="stylus">{{cite web|last=Drake|first=David|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/dead-prez/rbg-revolutionary-but-gangsta.htm|title=RBG (Revolutionary But Gangsta) Review|work=[[Stylus Magazine]]|date=2004-04-28|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> Aside from the lyrical showcase on "22 Two's", the discussion of relationship infidelities on "[[Ain't No Nigga]]" and braggadocios rhymes on "Brooklyn' Finest", the album's subject matter exclusively deals with Jay-Z's past criminal lifestyle. [[Allmusic]]'s Steve Huey describes him as a "a street hustler from the projects who rapped about what he knew<U+2014>and he was very, very good at it...detailing his experiences on the streets with disarming honesty".<ref name="AMG" /> Multiple aspects of this lifestyle are explored: "Can't Knock the Hustle" details Jay-Z's hustling talent, "Cashmere Thoughts" and "Dead Presidents II" explain his financial goals and other tracks like "D'evils" and "Regrets" detail how hustling negatively affects the mind. Huey summarizes the album's subject matter saying:

{{quote|He's cocky bordering on arrogant, but playful and witty, and exudes an effortless, unaffected cool throughout. And even if he's rapping about rising to the top instead of being there, his material obsessions are already apparent [...] the album's defining cut might [...] be the brief "22 Two's," which not only demonstrates Jay-Z's extraordinary talent as a pure freestyle rapper, but also preaches a subtle message through its club hostess: Bad behavior gets in the way of making money. Perhaps that's why Jay-Z waxes reflective, not enthusiastic, about the darker side of the streets.<ref name="AMG" />}}

===Production===
The beats on ''Reasonable Doubt'' were provided by already established [[East Coast hip hop]] producers, including [[DJ Premier]], [[DJ Clark Kent|Clark Kent]] and [[Ski (producer)|Ski]]. The production relies on [[soul music|soul]], [[funk]] and [[jazz]] [[sampling (music)|samples]] of artists such as [[Isaac Hayes]], the [[Ohio Players]] and [[Ahmad Jamal]]. The [[refrain]]s of a few songs contain vocal samples of rappers including [[Nas]], [[Fat Joe]] and [[Snoop Dogg]]. [[Allmusic]]'s Steve Birchmeier describes this production style as representing "the pre-[[Gangsta rap|gangsta]] era, a foregone era when samples fueled the beats and [[turntablism]] supplied the hooks" which "sets ''Reasonable Doubt'' apart from Jay-Z's later work".<ref name="AMG2">{{cite web | last = Birchmeier | first = Jason | url = http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:3nfwxqtjldte | title = Reasonable Doubt (Clean) Review  | publisher = [[Allmusic]] | accessdate = July 21 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>

"Can't Knock the Hustle" contains a "silky smooth"<ref name="ign">{{cite web|author=Spence D.|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/458/458784p1.html|title=Reasonable Doubt Review|publisher=[[IGN|IGN.com]]|date=2003-11-10|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> atmospheric beat layered with hard-hitting programmed drums and a [[xylophone]] loop. "Politics as Usual" has an [[Rhythm & Blues|R&B]] sound with its softer drums and sample of "Hurry Up This Way Again" by [[The Stylistics]].<ref name="ign" /> "Brooklyn's Finest" contrasts heavily with the first two tracks; it features an upbeat [[Honky tonk#Honky tonk music|honky tonk]] piano loop and smooth drums sampled from "Ecstasy" by the [[Ohio Players]]. "Dead Presidents" contains a down tempo beat composed of three samples: the drums from "[[Oh My God (A Tribe Called Quest song)|Oh My God]] (remix)" by [[A Tribe Called Quest]], the melody and piano loop from "A Garden of Peace" by [[Lonnie Liston Smith]] and a vocal sample from "[[The World Is Yours (song)|The World Is Yours]]" by [[Nas]]. According to [[IGN]]'s Spence D., "Ski brings back the stripped down piano fill style lending the track a late night jazz vibe" on "Feelin' It".<ref name="ign" /> "D'evils" features a downtrodden piano loop sampled from [[Allen Toussaint]]'s "Go Back Home" and vocal samples from [[LL Cool J]]'s "[[I Shot Ya]] (remix)" and [[Snoop Dogg]]'s "Murder Was the Case". "22 Two's" has a "mournful jazz inclined groove" that prominently features [[string instrument]]s.<ref name="ign" />

"Can I Live" samples [[Isaac Hayes]]' cover of "[[The Look of Love (1967 song)|The Look of Love]]" creating a slow beat with a mix of [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], [[Brass instrument|brass]] and string instruments. "Ain't No Nigga" contains a quick funky beat that samples the melody and drums from "Seven Minutes of Funk" by The Whole Darn Family. "Friend or Foe" follows with a slower funky beat that contains heavy use of brass and a programmed drum loop. "Coming of Age" contains a Clark Kent-produced beat that samples the melody and drums from "Inside You" by [[Eddie Henderson (musician)]].<ref name="ign" /> "Cashmere Thoughts" samples the guitar loop from [[Hamilton Bohannon|Bohannon]]'s "Save Their Souls" and adds claps and other sound effects. "Bring It On" contains a down tempo slow beat that features a string instrument loop and programmed drums. "Regrets" is driven by a jazzy sample from "It's So Easy Loving You" by [[Earl Klugh]] and [[Hubert Laws]], as well its heavy triangle use and acoustic guitar loop.

==Singles==
Four singles<U+2014>"Dead Presidents", "Ain't No Nigga", "Can't Knock the Hustle" and "Feelin' It"<U+2014>were released in promotion of ''Reasonable Doubt''. "Dead Presidents" features lyrics about illegally acquiring money and a somber [[Ski (producer)|Ski]]-produced beat that samples [[Lonnie Liston Smith]]'s "A Garden of Peace". Its chorus, sampled from [[Nas]]' "The World Is Yours",<ref name="skiinterview">{{cite web|last=Hatfield|first=Quinton|url=http://www.hhnlive.com/features/more/188|title=Roc-A-Biz: Ski Beatz|publisher=HNNLive.com|date=2007-01-07|accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref> illustrates the song's lyrical [[thesis]] and was cited throughout the [[Nas vs. Jay-Z feud]]. "Dead Presidents" is the only single that did not chart, but it was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref name="riaa" /> "Dead Presidents II" appears on ''Reasonable Doubt'', while the original appears on a single and on a music video directed by Abdul Malik Abbott. "Dead Presidents II" has the same beat and chorus as the original, but its lyrics are different.

The second single, "Ain't No Nigga", features female rapper [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]]. The song details a love relationship between Jay-Z and the materialistic Foxy Brown. The chorus [[interpolation (music)|interpolates]] "[[Ain't No Woman (Like the One I've Got)]]" by [[The Four Tops]]. The funky [[Big Jaz]]-produced beat sounds like [[EPMD]]'s "It's My Thing" because both tracks sample "Seven Minutes of Funk" by The Whole Darn Family. "Ain't No Nigga" was the most commercially successful single, reaching #50 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and #1 on the [[Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales]].<ref name="AMGchart">{{cite web | url = http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:hjftxqrgldhe~T51 | title = Jay-Z: Billboard Singles| publisher = [[Allmusic]] | accessdate = July 20 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> Abdul Malik Abbot directed the song's music video.

"Can't Knock the Hustle", the third single, features soulful singing by [[Mary J. Blige]]. The song features Jay-Z bragging about the lifestyle he created by becoming a successful hustler. Produced by [[Knobody]], the beat samples "Much Too Much" by [[Marcus Miller]] and "Fool's Paradise" by [[Meli'sa Morgan]]. It reached #73 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 making it the second most successful single on the album,<ref name="AMGchart" /> but it also reached #30 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] making it the most successful single in the United Kingdom.<ref name="EveryHit">{{cite web | url = http://www.everyhit.com/searchsec.php | title = UK Top 40 Hit Database: Jay-Z Singles | publisher = EveryHit.com | accessdate = July 20 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> A high budget music video directed by [[Hype Williams]] was made for "Can't Knock the Hustle".

The fourth and final single is the jazzy "Feelin' It". Guest singer Mecca sings the song's chorus and Jay-Z provides three verses about his lifestyle as a hustler. The song's [[piano]]-led beat is produced by Ski, who samples "Pastures" by [[jazz]] musician [[Ahmad Jamal]]. "Feelin' It" is the third most commercially successful single, reaching #79 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name="AMGchart" /> A low budget music video directed by Alan Ferguson was created for "Feelin' It".

==Reception==
''Reasonable Doubt'' peaked at #23 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], a rank lower than Jay-Z's future studio albums,<ref name="AMGchartalbum">{{cite web | url = http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:hjftxqrgldhe~T5 | title = Jay-Z: Billboard Albums | publisher = [[Allmusic]] | accessdate = July 22 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> and it was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] on February 7, 2002.<ref name="riaa" /> The album received positive reviews from music critics. [[Allmusic]] awarded it five stars,<ref name="AMG" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked it B+<ref name="ew">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2c%2c293565%2c00.html|title=Music Capsule Review|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1996-08-02|accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref> and ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' gave it four mics, but later changed it to a full five mic rating. In 1998, it was listed one of The Source's 100 Best Rap Albums.<ref name="source" /> It also ranks on top albums lists by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' (2003's "[[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]"),<ref name="RS500" /> ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' (2003's "500 CDs You Must Own Before You Die"),<ref name="acclaimed" /> ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' (2004's "51 Albums Representing a Generation, a Sound and a Movement")<ref name="acclaimed" /> and ''[[Hip Hop Connection]]'' (2006's "The 100 Greatest Rap Albums 1995-2005").<ref name="acclaimed" />

Lyrically, the album is praised for its honest and visual depictions of a hustler's life. Journalist [[Dream Hampton]] explains Jay-Z's lyrics saying: "MC's had definitely touched, you know, on hustling. But Jay, talks about what it can do to a person's inner peace, and what it can do to their mind".<ref name="VH1" /> Allmusic's Steve Huey explains that the lyrical appeal lies within Jay's "effortless, unaffected cool" flow, "disarming honesty", and his knack for "writing some of the most acrobatic rhymes heard in quite some time".<ref name="AMG" /> Huey writes that this lyrical depth "helps ''Reasonable Doubt'' rank as one of the finest albums of [[East Coast hip hop#The East Coast Renaissance|New York's hip-hop renaissance]] of the '90s".<ref name="AMG" /> Fellow Allmusic writer Jason Birchmeier claims that Jay-Z's lyrics are "candidly professional, but it's the producers more so than Jay-Z himself that make this album so untouchable".<ref name="AMG2" /> Birchmeier remarks that the album "boasts an amazing roster of producers", and Steve Juon agrees describing Ski, Clark Kent and DJ Premier as "the best beatmakers in rap".<ref name="raprev" /> Juon also recognizes the album's lyrical strength and describes the album's reception saying:

{{quote|[[This is not only the definitive album from [[Izzo (H.O.V.A.)|H to the Izzo's]] catalogue, it's one of the ten most important rap records of the entire 1990's. It's possible to live without having heard it - but after you do, you'll wonder how you ever managed without it. Even nearly six years later, this album stands up to the best production and strongest lyricism coming out of any rap around the globe. If an album could be said to have made corny MC's into Jay-Z haters, this is the one.<ref name="raprev" />}}

==Significance==
===Subsequent Jay-Z albums===
Despite being the lowest charting Jay-Z album,<ref name="AMGchartalbum" /> it is generally considered his best record.<ref name="AMGBio" /> It differs from his future albums in its lack of "[[Crossover (music)|pop-crossover]]" songs and chart topping hits.<ref name="AMGBio" /> Also, future Jay-Z albums were mainly produced by [[The Hitmen (production team)|The Hitmen]], [[Timbaland]] and [[Swizz Beatz]]. Shaheem Reid of [[MTV]] explains, "''Reasonable Doubt'' might not have the radio hits or club bangers of many of his other albums, but it may be Jay at his most lyrical<U+2014>and certainly at his most honest, according to him".<ref name="VH1News" /> Jay-Z continued many themes from ''Reasonable Doubt'' on future albums; his second album ''[[In My Lifetime, Vol. 1]]'' featured a song named "Friend or Foe '98" that continues the story from "Friend or Foe" and features similar DJ Premier production. Jay-Z's third album ''[[Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life]]'' contains a track named "Coming of Age (Da Sequel)". It features Memphis Bleek as does the original "Coming of Age", but it is produced by Swizz Beatz and its story changes drastically. Jay-Z feels that recreating ''Reasonable Doubt'' is challenging because he was living a different lifestyle with a completely different state of mind as he wrote the album.<ref name="VH1News" /><ref name="skiinterview" /><ref name="pfork">{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/18838-the-black-album|title=The Black Album Review|work=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=2003-11-17||accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref> Ian Cohen of ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' states its significance in context of Jay-Z's other major albums, ''[[The Blueprint]]'' and ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|The Black Album]]'': "''Reasonable Doubt'' was the come-up, ''The Blueprint'' was the comeback, and ''The Black Album'' may not have found him at his strongest lyrically, but it gained gravitas from meta-awareness and introspection".<ref name="stylus3">{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Ian|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/jay-z/kingdom-come.htm|title=Kingdom Come Review|work=[[Stylus Magazine]]|date=2006-11-22|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref>

===Mafioso rap/hip hop music===
Less than two years before ''Reasonable Doubt''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release, three popular [[Mafioso rap]] albums were released: [[Raekwon]]'s ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]]'', [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]]'s ''[[Doe or Die]]'' and Nas' ''[[It Was Written]]''. Jay-Z then burst on to the scene with his debut album that further popularized a genre in which drinking [[Cristal (champagne)|Cristal]], driving [[Lexus]] automobiles and living out the plots of films like ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' was commonplace.<ref name="clarion">{{cite web|url=http://media.www.theclariononline.com/media/storage/paper353/news/2007/04/11/Ae/HipHop.Generations.Defining.Albums-2844579.shtml|title=Hip-hop Generations: Defining Albums - A&E|work=The Clarion|date=2007-04-11|accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref> ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' writer Evan McGarvey claims that hustler rap group [[The Clipse]] try emulating Jay-Z's ''Reasonable Doubt'' sound on their 2006 song "We Got It for Cheap".<ref name="stylus4">{{cite web|last=McGarvey|first=Evan|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/clipse/hell-hath-no-fury.htm|title=Hell Hath No Fury Review|work=[[Stylus Magazine]]|date=2006-11-27|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref>

Jay-Z's influence also extended to hip hop music in general. On the title track from [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]]'s 2005 album ''[[The Documentary]]'', he references ''Reasonable Doubt'' as a classic album. [[Jean Grae]] also references the album on her 2004 song "Not like Me" by claiming that she would argue whether ''Reasonable Doubt'' or Nas' ''[[Illmatic]]'' is a better album. The album's vocals have been sampled on multiple occasions: [[Chubb Rock]]'s "Survive", Termanology's "Watch How It Go Down", [[Apathy (rapper)|Apathy]]'s "9 to 5" and [[Mary J. Blige]]'s "Round and Round" contains samples from "D'evils" and [[De La Soul]]'s "[[Shopping Bags (She Got from You)]]" contains samples from "Brooklyn's Finest". It is often "considered one of hip-hop's landmark albums" according to [[Pitchfork Media]]'s Ryan Schreiber.<ref name="pfork" /> It is compared to The Notorious B.I.G.'s ''[[Ready to Die]]'' and Nas' ''Illmatic'' as a classic album.<ref name="AMG" /><ref name="stylus2">{{cite web|last=McGarvey|first=Evan|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/lil-wayne/da-drought-3.htm|title=Da Drought 3 Review|work=[[Stylus Magazine]]|date=2007-05-10|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref><ref name="village">{{cite web|last=Breihan|first=Tom|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/blogs/statusainthood/archives/2006/06/jayzs_reasonabl_1.php|title=Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt Anniversary Show at Radio City: Really That Good|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=2006-06-26|accessdate=2008-02-09}}</ref>

==10 Year Anniversary Concert==
In 2006, Jay-Z performed the songs from ''Reasonable Doubt'' at the [[Radio City Music Hall]] to celebrate its ten-year anniversary. The concert's band included [[The Roots]]' drummer [[Questlove]], the Illadelphonics, a 50-piece orchestra dubbed The Hustla's Symphony and [[Just Blaze]], the performance's [[disc jockey]].<ref name="VH1News" /> It featured vocals from all original album guests except [[Mary J. Blige]], The Notorious B.I.G. and [[Jaz-O]]. [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]] replaced Mary J. Blige for "Can't Knock the Hustle", Jay-Z rapped The Notorious B.I.G.'s verses on "Brooklyn's Finest" and Jaz-O's verse was left out of "Bring It On". While Blige was preparing for her [[The Breakthrough|Breakthrough Tour]] and The Notorious B.I.G. had died nine years before the concert, Jaz-O did not perform because of his feud with Jay-Z.<ref name="VH1News" /> Jay-Z added a verse to "22 Two's" in which he says variations of the words "for/four" 44 times over the beat of "[[Can I Kick It?]]" by [[A Tribe Called Quest]]. Other alterations include Jay-Z changing a lyrical mention of [[Cristal (champagne)|Cristal]] to [[Dom P<U+00E9>rignon (wine)|Dom P<U+00E9>rignon]] and Jay-Z's band "spruc[ing] up tracks like 'Regrets' to add more energy".<ref name="VH1News" /> Celebrities including [[Alicia Keys]], [[Young Jeezy]], [[Jadakiss]], [[Chris Tucker]], [[Lebron James]] and [[Carmelo Anthony]] attended the concert. Three thousand tickets were put on sale; all were sold within two minutes according to Roc-A-Fella Records' website.<ref name="pitchforkmedia">{{cite web|last=Humphreys|first=Quanah|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/36899-jay-z-to-play-ireasonable-doubti-anniversary-gig|title=Jay-Z to Play Reasonable Doubt Anniversary Gig|work=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=2006-06-13|accessdate=2007-06-22}}</ref>
