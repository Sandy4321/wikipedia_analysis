The '''Megaconference''', founded and organized by [[Robert S. Dixon]], is an annual large-scale, multi-site conferencing event bringing together participants to promote, discuss, and test all aspects of IP-based H.323. Participants connect to the event simultaneously through a system of distributed [[H.323]], [[session initiation protocol]] (SIP), and other compatible [[Multipoint Control Unit]]s (MCUs), located around the world that cascade together to create the largest forum in the field of Internet [[videoconferencing]].<ref>https://www.oar.net/press/megaconference_vii_set_december_1</ref>

==History==
The first Megaconference debuted in October 1999 during the [[Internet2]] fall conference in [[Seattle]], where participants presented songs, dances and skits to 60 linked sites.<ref>http://www.h323forum.org/news/RADVISION-ViDeNet_project.pdf</ref>

[[Ohio State University]] and the [[Ohio Supercomputer Center]] (OSC) provide the hardware and the technical support for the Megaconference, including Multipoint Control coordination and network operations. The Megaconference runs on the Internet2 Commons network, which sits on the OSC network. OSC Networking provides the 24/7 Global H.323 [[network operations center]] (NOC) for testing, network operations, engineering and support for the Megaconference.

==Participation==
Anyone using H.323 or compatible videoconferencing equipment is able to participate or submit a proposal for <U+201C>interactions<U+201D> or interactive presentation that must involve at least a total of two locations.<ref>http://archive.osc.edu/press/releases/2006/megacon.shtml</ref> Presentation topics range from how groups use Internet videoconferencing in real-world situations for teaching, learning, and sharing knowledge and information. Observers may also watch a live stream or recorded version of the event.

==Spin-offs==

===Megaconference, Jr.===
In 2004, '''Megaconference, Jr''' became the first global web-based videoconference for students in kindergarten to grade twelve. Student teams organize and coordinate the event, as well as provide troubleshooting for technical requirements.<ref>Fratt, L. (2004). Megaconference Jr. = Mega Success. District Administration, 40(7), 12</ref>

===Gigaconference===
Debuting in 2005, the '''Gigaconference''' showcases the use of high-end, high-performance videoconferencing equipment. Participating sites give presentations on topics like animated videos, musical performances, classroom teaching experiences, and remote medical collaboration. Unlike the Megaconference, participants require a connection speed of at least 1 [[Megabit]] per second, in addition to 4 [[Common Intermediate Format|CIF]] resolution, or 30 frames per second or higher.<ref>http://archive.osc.edu/press/releases/2005/gigaconference.shtml</ref>
