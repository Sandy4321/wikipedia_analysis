"'''Lisa the Vegetarian'''" is the fifth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''{{'}} [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on October 15, 1995. In the episode, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] decides to stop eating meat after bonding with a lamb at a petting zoo. Her schoolmates and family members ridicule her for her beliefs, but with the help of [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]], [[Paul McCartney|Paul]], and [[Linda McCartney]], she commits to [[vegetarianism]].

Directed by [[Mark Kirkland]], "Lisa the Vegetarian" is the first full-length episode [[David X. Cohen]] wrote for ''The Simpsons''. [[David Mirkin]], the [[show runner]] at the time, supported the episode in part because he had just become a vegetarian himself. [[Dan Castellaneta]], the voice of Homer Simpson, is also a vegetarian. Former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] Paul McCartney and his then wife Linda McCartney guest star in the episode. Paul McCartney's condition for appearing was that Lisa would remain a vegetarian for the rest of the series. The episode makes several references to McCartney's musical career, and his song "[[Maybe I'm Amazed]]" plays during the [[closing credits]].

"Lisa the Vegetarian" was watched by 14.6 million viewers<ref>{{cite news |title=Nielsen ratings |work=[[USA Today]] |author=USA Today|page=D3 |date=October 18, 1995}}</ref> and finished 47th in the ratings for the week of October 9<U+2013>15, 1995, with a 9.0 [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]]. It was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. The episode received generally positive reviews from television critics. It has won two awards, an [[Environmental Media Awards|Environmental Media Award]] and a [[Genesis Awards|Genesis Award]], for highlighting environmental and animal issues.

==Plot==
The [[Simpson family]] visits a petting zoo, where [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] is enraptured by a cute lamb. That night, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] serves [[meat chop|lamb chops]] for dinner, but Lisa is troubled by the connection between the dish and its living counterpart, and announces that she will no longer eat meat. In response, her brother [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and her father [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] mock her relentlessly. Reaction at school is no better; when Lisa requests a vegetarian alternative to the cafeteria food, [[Principal Skinner]] labels her an "agitator." The students are then forced to watch a Meat Council [[propaganda film]], starring [[Troy McClure]], which criticizes vegetarianism. Lisa is unimpressed by the film, but her classmates tease her.

Homer and Bart continue to give Lisa a hard time at home, particularly since Homer is ready to host a [[barbecue]], complete with roast pig. Bart and Homer even form a [[conga line]] and sing, "You don't win friends with salad!" On the day of the barbecue, Lisa makes [[gazpacho]] for all the guests as an alternative to meat, but the partygoers laugh in her face. Enraged and deeply hurt, she climbs aboard a riding mower and drives away with the roast pig in tow. Homer and Bart chase her, but she pushes the pig off a slope and they are too late. The pig rolls through bushes, into a river, and is shot into the air by a dam [[spillway]]'s suction.

At home, Homer scolds Lisa for ruining his party, and she rebukes him for serving a meat-based dish. They fight and she leaves the house, not wanting to live in a house with a "prehistoric carnivore." As Lisa walks along, she decides that she can no longer fight the pressure to eat meat, prompting her to grab a hot dog from the grill at the [[Kwik-E-Mart]] and take a bite. However, Apu, himself a [[Veganism|vegan]], reveals that she has eaten a [[tofu]] dog. Apu takes Lisa through a secret passageway to the Kwik-E-Mart roof, where they meet Paul and Linda McCartney. The McCartneys explain that they are old friends of Apu from Paul's days in India, and discuss their interest in animal rights. After a brief discussion, Lisa is committed once more to vegetarianism, but she realizes that she should tolerate those who disagree with her views. Inspired, Lisa begins to return home and finds Homer frantically searching for her. She apologizes to Homer, admitting she had no right to ruin his barbecue; he forgives her and offers her a "[[Piggy-back (transportation)|veggie back]]" ride home. The final credits play over the still airborne roast pig.

Cohen could not concentrate on his task because he was waiting for lunch, and on the back of the script he scribbled, "Lisa becomes a vegetarian?" Cohen showed the note to ''Simpsons'' writer [[Brent Forrester]], who liked the idea.<ref name="Cohen"/> Show runner [[David Mirkin]] then approved the story when Cohen pitched it to him. Mirkin had just become a vegetarian himself, and later noted that many of Lisa's experiences in the episode were based on his own.<ref name="Mirkin"/>

Writer [[Bill Oakley]] suggested the episode's barbecue scenes.<ref name="Cohen"/> Cohen's first draft contained a more philosophical argument between Lisa and Homer about eating meat, but Oakley told Cohen that the story needed something more specific to serve as the basis of Homer and Lisa's dispute.<ref name="Cohen"/> [[George Meyer]], a writer known among the ''Simpsons'' staff for his "bizarre physical jokes",<ref name="Mirkin"/> contributed the idea of the barbecue pig getting caught in the spillway and flying into the air.<ref name="Mirkin"/>

===Voice acting===
At the time the episode was being written, Paul McCartney was the only living member of [[The Beatles]] who had never appeared on ''The Simpsons''. [[John Lennon]] died before the show was created, but [[Ringo Starr]] and [[George Harrison]] had guest starred in 1991 ("[[Brush with Greatness]]") and 1993 ("[[Homer's Barbershop Quartet]]"), respectively.<ref name="Mirkin"/><ref name="dailynewsny2">{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1995/10/14/1995-10-14_television.html |title=Television |date=October 14, 1995 |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |author=Bianculli, David |accessdate=2008-12-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/HWMin/9509/09-29/index.html |title=The Hollywood Minute |last=Michael |first=Dennis |date=September 29, 1995 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=2008-12-27}}</ref> The ''Simpsons'' staff wanted to bring McCartney onto the show, and David Mirkin thought "Lisa the Vegetarian" would be an attractive story, since McCartney is a vegetarian himself.<ref name="Mirkin"/> McCartney agreed to appear, but requested that Lisa remain a vegetarian for the rest of the series, rather than revert to meat-eating in the next episode.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.videtteonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=26259:joel-cohen-discusses-the-ins-and-outs-of- |title=Joel Cohen discusses the ins and outs of "The Simpsons" |last=Tomlin |first=Hannah |date=December 2, 2008 |work=[[The Daily Vidette]] |accessdate=2008-12-27}}</ref><ref name="NZ">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sideswipe/news/article.cfm?c_id=702&objectid=10593582 |title=Sideswipe: McCartney keeps Lisa vegetarian |date=August 28, 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref><ref name="erin"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8449416.stm |title=The Simpsons: 10 classic episodes |date=2010-01-14 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2010-01-14}}</ref> The ''Simpsons'' staff promised that she would remain a vegetarian,<ref name="NZ"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117961291.html?categoryid=14&cs=1 |title='Simpsons' chat closes Paley fest |last=Schneider |first=Michael |date=March 16, 2007 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref> resulting in one of the few permanent character changes made in the show.<ref name="Groening">Groening, Matt.

===Directing and animating===
The episode was directed by [[Mark Kirkland]],<ref name="BBC"/> who was intrigued by the story because he had not seen many television episodes about vegetarianism.<ref name="Kirkland"/> The designs for Paul and Linda McCartney are unusual for ''The Simpsons'' in that the characters have brown and blue irises, respectively. Most ''Simpsons'' characters simply have black spots in the centers of their eyes.<ref name="Kirkland"/>

In one scene of the episode, Homer sprays two bottles of lighter fluid onto his grill, causing viewers to anticipate an explosion when Homer throws a match on it. When he does release the match, however, the grill barely ignites. A similar scene appears in an older episode of ''The Simpsons'', "[[Treehouse of Horror]]", although in that episode, Homer uses a single bottle of lighter fluid and causes an explosion. Mirkin enjoyed the joke enough to reuse parts of it in "Lisa the Vegetarian", adding new twists to further enhance the comedic effect.<ref name="Mirkin"/> The old sketches from the "Treehouse of Horror" episode were used to help the animators animate the scene.<ref name="Kirkland">Kirkland, Mark. (2005). Commentary for "Lisa the Vegetarian", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>

==Cultural references==
The episode features several references to The Beatles and [[Paul McCartney (solo)|McCartney's solo career]].<ref name="Mirkin"/> For instance, McCartney tells Lisa that playing his 1970 song "[[Maybe I'm Amazed]]" backwards will reveal a secret recipe for lentil soup.<ref name="BBC"/> A modified version of the song plays in the final scene, then over the closing credits of the episode;<ref name="Groening"/> when played backwards, McCartney can be heard reciting the recipe in the song. Mirkin had McCartney record the recipe, which was later added in reverse over the original song.<ref name="Mirkin"/> McCartney thought it was "very funny" that the staff wanted to "send up the whole cult thing" of [[backmasking]] on the Beatles' songs. "A secret lentil soup recipe seemed a nice parody of that," he said.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/nov/29/paul-mccartney-the-fireman-interview |title=Percy Thrillington, Magritte & me |last=Odell |first=Michael |date=November 29, 2008 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2008-12-27 |location=London}}</ref> One of the backwards snippets says, "Oh, and by the way, I'm alive,"<ref name="Mirkin"/> a reference to the [[Paul is dead]] theory.<ref name="BBC"/><ref name="Mirkin"/>

When Lisa, Apu, and the McCartneys gather on the Kwik-E-Mart roof, Apu tells Lisa, "I learned long ago to tolerate others rather than forcing my beliefs on them. You know, you can influence people without badgering them always. It's like Paul's song, 'Live and Let Live'." Paul corrects Apu and says the song's title is actually "[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]".<ref name="book"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://archive.rollingstone.com/Desktop?s=2002112840#/20021128/56 |title=Springfield, Rock City |last=Nawrocki |first=Tom |date=November 28, 2002 |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=2008-12-07}} {{Subscription required}}</ref> In the same scene, Apu refers to himself as the "[[fifth Beatle]]",<ref name="matthew"/> and Linda alludes to a line in the Beatles' 1969 song "[[Octopus's Garden]]".<ref name="BBC">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season7/page5.shtml |title=Lisa the Vegetarian |accessdate=2008-11-30 |author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |year=2000 |publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref><ref name="blender"/> The McCartneys later ask Lisa if she would like to hear a song, and Apu sings part of "[[Sgt.

===Critical reviews===

He thought it was "absolutely hilarious", and praised Kirkland for his animation. Mirkin also enjoyed the use of Apu in the episode, because Apu shows Lisa that "the way to get people to change is through tolerance and understanding."<ref name="Mirkin"/> Groening considers the joke in which the family forms a conga line one of the "high-points" in the history of ''The Simpsons''.<ref name="Groening"/>

Television critics praised "Lisa the Vegetarian" for its humor. John Serba of the ''[[Grand Rapids Press]]'' named it his favorite episode, "because the tale of Lisa's conversion to vegetarianism has more humorous scenes per square inch than any other episode."<ref>{{cite news |title='Simpsons' fans can watch, cheer for and quote 'em with the best |last=Serba |first=John |date=November 3, 2002 |work=[[Grand Rapids Press]] |page=F2}}</ref> The ''Ventura County Reporter''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Matthew Singer thought it was "overflowing with great individual scenes", particularly Troy McClure's Meat Council propaganda video, which he said "may be the funniest isolated segment in the history of the show."<ref name="matthew"/> [[MSNBC]]'s Patrick Enright, who listed the episode as his second favorite of the series, highlighted the "You don't win friends with salad!" song as "one of those archetypal ''Simpsons'' moments, one in which the writers hit a joke so long that it goes from funny to unfunny and back to funny again."<ref>{{cite web |first=Patrick |last=Enwright |title=D<U+2019>Oh!

Reviewers of the episode have also praised it for its character development. Todd Gilchrist of [[IGN]] said he thinks the key to ''The Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> longevity is its "sentimental but not gooey" approach to storytelling and character development. He took "Lisa the Vegetarian" as an example and said: "Lisa sabotages Homer's barbecue, which results in an unceremonious death for his prize pig. But rather than simply punctuating the episode with an iconic image of the porker soaring through the air, the writers actually develop a story into which the joke fits. The comedic effect is actually intensified because we care about the characters, are invested in the story, and primed for a great gag."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/676/676342p1.html |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season |last=Gilchrist |first=Todd |date=December 15, 2005 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref> The ''[[Niagara Gazette]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Phil Dzikiy said that "the character development and storytelling is perfect", noting that the episode was "equally hilarious, touching and satirical".<ref name="Dzikiy"/>
