'''Mount Elkins''', also known as '''J<U+00F6>kelen''' (which means "The Glacier" in Russian) is a dark, steep-sided [[mountain]] with three major peaks, the highest 2,300 metres above sea level. This peak is located in the [[Napier Mountains]], in [[Enderby Land]]. Enderby Land is part of the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]], in [[East Antarctica]].

== Location ==
Some notable geographic features in the general vicinity of Mount Elkins include [[Cape Batterbee]] (92 km to the north), the [[Young Nunataks]] (7.4 km to the south), [[Sortoppen Nunatak]] (30 km to the east), the [[Newman Nunataks]] (26 km to the west), [[Mount McMaster]] (97 km to the west), and [[Mount Kjerringa]] (57 km to the northeast). The nearest permanently inhabited place is [[Mawson Station]], an Australian research station to the southeast. [[Molodyozhnaya Station]], a former Soviet research station which was mothballed in 1989, is located to the southwest of Mount Elkins. There are plans to reopen Molodyozhnaya Station in 2008.

Mount Elkins is the highest peak in the Napier Mountains. It is the second highest peak in the [[Enderby Land Coast Ranges]], behind [[Mount McMaster]], whose summit lies at 2830 metres above sea level. It is the third highest peak in the [[Wilkes Land Coast Ranges]], which are the parent range of the Enderby Land Coast Ranges. It is the 27th highest peak in the [[East Antarctica Ranges]], which are the parent range of the Wilkes Land Coast Ranges.

== History ==
Mount Elkins was first mapped by Norwegian cartographers from aerial photographs taken by the [[Lars Christensen]] Expedition, 1936-37, and named at that time J<U+00F6>kelen (The Glacier). It was remapped by [[ANARE]] from aerial photographs taken from an ANARE aircraft in 1956. The Napier Mountains were first visited by an ANARE survey party from Mawson Station in 1960. The survey party was led by [[Syd Kirkby]], and included [[Terence James Elkins]]. The mountain was named after Terence James Elkins, ionospheric physicist with ANARE at Mawson Station in 1960.

== Geology & Orogeny ==
Mount Elkins is a classic example of Napier [[orogeny]]. The oldest [[crustal]] components found to date in the Napier Complex appear to be of [[igneous]] derivation; some of the [[zircons]] collected from its [[orthogneiss]]es are among the [[oldest rock]] specimens found on Earth. The orogenic events which resulted in the formation of the Napier Complex (including Mount Elkins) have been dated to the [[Archaean]] [[eon]]. More specifically, the oldest tectonothermal event is currently believed to have occurred approximately 2837 <U+00B1> 15 million years ago, using SHRIMPU<U+2013>Pb zircon [[Dating methodology (archaeology)|dating methodology]].<ref>http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1047/ea/of2007-1047ea187.pdf ''New Evidence for the Early Archean Evolution of Aker Peaks Napier Mountains Enderby Land (East Antarctica)'', by B. V. Belyatsky et al., USGS Open-File Report 2007-1047</ref> 

Napier orogeny is characterized by high-grade metamorphism and [[plate tectonics]]. Billions of years of [[erosion]] and [[tectonic]] deformation have exposed the [[metamorphic rock]] core of these mountains.

== Significance to Mountain Climbers ==
The three largest mountain ranges in Antarctica are the [[Transantarctic Mountains]], the [[West Antarctica Ranges]], and the [[East Antarctica Ranges]]. The East Antarctica Ranges, located on the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]], have 29 known peaks whose summits reach or exceed 2000 metres above sea level. These peaks are collectively referred to as the [[East Antarctic two-thousanders]]. With its summit at 2300 meters above sea level, Mount Elkins ranks 27th on this list, but because of its remoteness it has not become a popular target for [[peak bagging]].
