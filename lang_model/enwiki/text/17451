In the ''Dead or Alive'' back story, [[List of Dead or Alive characters#Raidou|Raidou]] raped Ayame, [[Kasumi (Dead or Alive)|Kasumi]]'s mother and wife of Shiden, leader of the {{nihongo|Mugen Tenshin|<U+9727><U+5E7B><U+5929><U+795E><U+6D41>|Mugen Tenshin-ry<U+016B>|lit. "Mist Phantom Heavenly Deity Style"}} ninja clan, resulting in the conception and birth of Ayane. Ayane is overshadowed by her half-sister Kasumi and bears jealousy and hatred towards her<ref name=man/> and her privileged upbringing. The Mugen Tenshin villagers allowed Ayane to stay, but disliked and looked down on her. Since they were children, Ayane has secretly admired her half-brother [[List of Dead or Alive characters#Hayate/Ein|Hayate]] as a way of increasing her self-esteem. Hayate is portrayed as fond of her in return. Ayame's ire focusses on Raidou (alongside Kasumi) who both created and ruined her life.<ref name=x2/><ref name=doa4/> Ayane's envy towards Kasumi is similar to the hatred Raidou had towards Shiden, Kasumi's father.

Depicted as quiet and reserved, Ayane has honed her skills in an attempt to make others see her as more than a "demon child". With the death of her former master [[List of Dead or Alive characters#Genra/Omega|Genra]] at the end of ''[[Dead or Alive 3|DOA3]]'', Ayane becomes the strongest ninja of the {{nihongo|Hajin Mon|<U+8987><U+795E><U+9580>||lit.

Ayane wears a variety of mostly purple and black female ninja suits and other attires (including a schoolgirl uniform<ref>[http://uk.dreamcast.ign.com/articles/076/076275p1.html Dead or Alive 2 Schoolgirl Outfits Revealed], IGN, March 8, 2000</ref> and a [[Carnival of Venice]]-style costume),<ref>Mike Fahey, [http://kotaku.com/#!5404197/ninja-gaiden-sigma-2-gets-fashionable-dlc Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Gets Fashionable DLC], Kotaku, November 13, 2009</ref> often coming with a [[miniskirt]] or [[tunic]] and often featuring a butterfly motif.

Ayane is the youngest female character in the series, being introduced at the age of only 16. She stands at 5'2" and weighs 104 lbs, with a bust size of 93&nbsp;cm (37"),<ref name=girls/> and has one of the most distinctive appearances out of ''DOA'' girls because of her unusually-colored purple hair and red eyes.

====''Dead or Alive''====
Ayane was introduced as a [[player character]] in the 1998 [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] port of ''[[Dead or Alive (video game)|Dead or Alive]]'',<ref>[http://www.1up.com/features/retroactive-dead-alive-series Retro/Active - Dead or Alive Series], 1UP.com</ref> in which she is an opponent character in the practice and tournament modes (this also in the prior [[Sega Saturn]] version) as well as an [[Unlockable (gaming)|unlockable]] secret character.<ref>Jason Rybka, [http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/psone/tp/DeadorAlive-PS1.htm Dead or Alive Cheats - PlayStation (PS1)], About.com</ref> In the original ''DOA'', Ayane has had neither a written background nor in-game plot-line (according to the later [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], Ayane was sent to secretly follow Kasumi)<ref name=story>[http://teamninja-studio.com/doa5/uk/story.html Dead or Alive 5 Official Site: The story so far...], Team Ninja</ref>. In ''[[Dead or Alive 2]]'' (1999), Ayane joins in the Dead or Alive World Combat Championship as an assassin in pursuit of her half-sister Kasumi, a runaway [[shinobi]] who has left the Mugen Tenshin behind and been branded a "traitor" to their clan.<ref name=man/> Ayane encounters and rescues an [[amnesia]]c Hayate, who goes by the name "[[List of Dead or Alive characters#Hayate/Ein|Ein]]". When confronting [[List of Dead or Alive characters#Helena Douglas|Helena]], Ayane is accused of murdering Helena's mother [[List of Dead or Alive characters#Maria|Maria]], but the assassin is later revealed to be [[List of Dead or Alive characters#Christie|Christie]].

In ''[[Dead or Alive 3]]'' (2001), the leader of the Mugen Tenshin's Hajin Mon sect (also written as Hajinmon)<ref name=man/> and Ayane's former teacher and beloved foster parent, Genra, has disappeared. Ayane, now the most powerful member and ''de facto'' leader of Hajin Mon, learns that Genra has been turned into a puppet by the DOATEC and its sinister Omega Project and realises that fate commands her to put Genra out of his misery.<ref>[http://uk.xbox.gamespy.com/xbox/dead-or-alive-3/guide/page_20.html Dead or Alive 3 - xbox - Walkthrough and Guide  - Page 20], GameSpy</ref> Achieving this, she emerges as official winner of the third DOA championship.

In ''[[Dead or Alive 4]]'' (2005), Ayane has pledged her life to her half-brother and Mugen Tenshin clan leader Hayate, in his cause to destroy the DOATEC for the suffering the company has caused the ninja clans.  Ayane has a threefold stake in this plot: she wants revenge for Raidou being changed into a monster, for Hayate being brainwashed in their attempt to realize Project Epsilon, and for the manipulation and death of Genra. At the end of the game, Ayane uses her ''ninpo'' ("ninja arts") spell to blow up the DOATEC Tri-Tower.<ref>Ayane's ending FMV in ''Dead or Alive 4'' ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlUllWSV2U4 video])</ref>

Ayane follows Kasumi upon Hayate's orders, and later discovers that she is in fact really an Alpha clone. They learn from Helena that [[List of Dead or Alive characters#Victor Donovan|Victor Donovan]] and his new organization, MIST, plans to sell his Alpha clones as super soldiers to various countries around the world. They infiltrate the oil rig platform where Helena believes MIST's secret laboratory is hidden. After Ayane and Hayate kill Kasumi's clone, they infiltrate the lab, but Hayate is captured by [[List of Dead or Alive characters#Rig|Rig]] and Ayane is forced to flee. After Ryu summons the real Kasumi to battle and Hayate is rescued, they destroy the laboratory and Alpha-152.

Besides the main ''DOA'' series, Ayane appears as one of the player characters in the beach volleyball spin-off games ''[[Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball]]'' (2003), ''[[Dead or Alive Xtreme 2]]'' (2006) and ''[[Dead or Alive Paradise]]'' (2010), pursuing Kasumi.<ref name=x2/> ''Dead or Alive: Cronus'', the series' prequel project which was intended to tell the story of Kasumi's and Ayane's childhoods and explore "the innocence and cruelty of children,"<ref>[http://www.computerandvideogames.com/101075/tecmo-speaks-out-on-dead-or-alive-cronus/ Xbox News: Tecmo speaks out on Dead Or Alive: Cronus], ComputerAndVideoGames.com, 4 February 2004</ref> was officially cancelled in 2010 after Itagaki left Team Ninja and Tecmo.<ref> JC Fletcher, [http://www.joystiq.com/2010/11/05/team-ninjas-dead-or-alive-code-cronus-and-project-progressive/ Team Ninja's Dead or Alive: Code Cronus and Project Progressive canceled], Joystiq, November 5, 2010</ref>

====Gameplay====
According to [[Prima Games]]' official guide for ''Dead or Alive Ultimate'', if one likes "fast, unpredictable characters, there's simply no one better than Ayane." She "is fun to play, and she is usable at just about any level of play, from beginner to expert, due to unorthodox fighting method and speed" as well as "devastating holds and throws." It stated Ayane may not be favored by those who prefer "huge, over-the-top moves", but for a "more patient sort, there's probably no better character in the game."<ref name=prima1>Eric Mylonas, ''Dead or Alive Ultimate (Prima Official Game Guide)'', Prima Games 2004 (p. 72)</ref> According to [[GameSpy]]{{'}}s guide by Andrew Alfonso, Ayane's key moves include her high kick<U+2014>which is "a lot" better than Kasumi's<U+2014>with another move so powerful "it's almost unfair to use it." She is more effective with her back turned towards her opponent, despite the fact that the characters cannot block when facing away from an enemy.<ref>Andrew Alfonso, [http://uk.xbox.gamespy.com/xbox/dead-or-alive-ultimate/guide/page_31.html Dead or Alive Ultimate - xbox - Walkthrough and Guide - Page 31], GameSpy, January 24, 2004</ref> According to GameSpy's guide to ''Dead or Alive 3'' by the same author, Ayane is a very unpredictable and quick attacker, even more than in the previous games in the series, and should be played primarily for her backwards position, hers being the best such stance of all the characters in the game. Ayane's speed and deceiving attacks make her a "pretty good" partner for slower fighters for tag team battles, but her primary partners are the other ninja characters.<ref>Andrew Alfonso, [http://uk.xbox.gamespy.com/xbox/dead-or-alive-3/guide/page_20.html Dead or Alive 3 - xbox - Walkthrough and Guide - Page 20], GameSpy, January 15, 2001</ref>

According to Prima's official guide for ''Dead or Alive 4'', while in the previous ''DOA'' games Ayane has been "one of the easiest characters to use and was very difficult to fight against", in this game she "now requires much more skill in high-level players, as her best attack as nowhere as dominant as they were in the past." She was rated overall 7/10.<ref>Bryan Dawson, ''Dead or Alive 4 (Prima Official Game Guide)'', Prima Games 2006 (p. 61)</ref> According to [[GameSpot]]'s guide for ''DOA4'' by Matthew Rorie, Ayane is "one of the more devious characters" of the game, "capable of devastating speed and some ingenious little fake-out animations", but she requires "a lot more practice than is apparent at first glance."<ref>Matthew Rorie, [http://www.gamespot.com/features/dead-or-alive-4-walkthrough-6142341/?page=9 Dead or Alive 4 Walkthrough - Page 9 - Game Guides], GameSpot</ref> In GameSpy's guide, David McCutcheon wrote that "widely regarded as the [[Ken Masters|Ken]]/[[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]] of the ''Dead or Alive'' series, Ayane can be both incredibly cheap and remarkably skilled," as "rolling and spinning will work wonders for your countering effects" and one "can juggle enemies to endless amounts of pain."<ref>David McCutcheon, [http://uk.xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/dead-or-alive-4/guide/page_14.html Dead or Alive 4 - xbox360 - Walkthrough and Guide - Page 14], GameSpy, January 24, 2006</ref> Ayane's move set in an early version of ''Dead or Alive 5'' seems almost identical to this in ''DOA4'',<ref>Sebastian Haley, [http://venturebeat.com/2011/12/09/team-ninja-studio-head-talks-dlc-costumes-and-tekken-vs-dead-or-alive/ Team Ninja studio head talks DLC costumes and Tekken vs. Dead or Alive], VentureBeat, December 9, 2011</ref><ref>David Hinkle, [http://www.joystiq.com/2011/12/10/beautiful-brawling-in-dead-or-alive-5/ Beautiful brawling in Dead or Alive 5], Joystiq, December 10, 2011</ref> but she has some new moves.<ref name=tm/> In ''Dead or Alive 5'', "her mastery of ever-changing moves means her opponents never know what is coming."<ref name=tm>[http://teamninja-studio.com/doa5/uk/chara02.html Dead or Alive Official Site: Ayane, The Killer Kunoichi], Team Ninja</ref>

In the ''DOA Extreme'' and ''Paradise'' beach volleyball games, Ayane has excellent technique and jump abilities, at the cost of poor defence, power and speed.<ref name=x2>''Dead or Alive Xtreme 2'' manual, page 10</ref> As such, she is most effective as a supporting player. In ''Ninja Gaiden <U+03A3> 2'', Ayane's attacks (many of her Fuma Kodachi [[Combo (video gaming)|combos]] resemble her combos from ''Dead or Alive'') and finishing moves are far faster than these of Ryu, but the player has to learn to dodge much more as she has worse blocking abilities.<ref>[http://resolution-magazine.co.uk/content/hands-on-ninja-gaiden-sigma-2/ Hands-on | Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2], Resolution Magazine, June 27, 2009</ref> According to Prima's official guide for this game, Ayane's short range and limited attack power "make her the worst choice of the three new characters for almost every mission" and "her only saving graces" are a powerful ninpo spell and deadly Flash [[Kunai]] projectiles. In addition, the CPU-controlled character "doesn't seem to know what to do in any situation."<ref>Bryan Dawson, ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2: Prima Official Guide'', Prima Games 2009 (p. 28, 51)</ref>

===In film===
[[File:Natassia_Malthe_as_Ayane_DOA.jpg|thumb|left|[[Natassia Malthe]]'s role in the film ''[[DOA: Dead or Alive]]'' was mostly poorly received, including criticism from [[Tomonobu Itagaki]]]]

In the live-action film ''[[DOA: Dead or Alive]]'', Ayane is a ninja assassin and Kasumi's former servant who is dedicated to seeking and killing her, as Kasumi is considered an outcast to the clan. Ayane first confronts Kasumi before she flees the temple, then several times on the island. She has romantic feelings towards Hayate (she is not his half-sister in the movie, and neither she is Kasumi's),<ref>Alexander Villafania, [http://technology.inquirer.net/infotech/infotech/view/20070202-47162/Movie_review%3A_The_girls_of_Dead_or_Alive Movie review: The girls of Dead or Alive], ''Philippine Daily Inquirer'', 2 February 2007</ref> and initially believes him to be dead. Ayane fails to kill Kasumi but finds Hayate and aids him against DOATEC. During the film's finale, she saves him from a potentially fatal fall.<ref>SpoonyOne, [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/spoonyone/reviews/32644-doa-dead-or-alive DOA: Dead or Alive], That Guy With The Glasses, 1 October 2011</ref>

====Portrayal====
Ayane was controversially portrayed by [[Natassia Malthe]], a half-[[Norwegians|Norwegian]] half-[[Filipino people|Filipina]] actress who was also much older than Ayane is portrayed in the games. Malthe's Ayane uses a Japanese long sword and also wields two longs swords in the various promotional images in and out of character.<ref>[http://uk.ign.com/images/stars/natassia-malthe-914678 Natassia Malthe Pictures, Photos, Images], IGN</ref> Tomonobu Itagaki later said he "wanted to have Japanese actresses portray Kasumi and Ayane" but the film's director [[Corey Yuen]] "believed strongly in his casting choices." Itagaki said he would have chosen [[Aya Ueto]] to play Ayane.<ref>[http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/706/706037p1.html E3 2006: Tomonobu Itagaki Interview], IGN, May 8, 2006</ref>

On the other hand, Ayane's portrayal by Natassia Malthe in the film ''DOA: Dead or Alive'' was panned by fans and critics alike (even as, prior to the premiere, IGN stated that "''DOA'' is HOT... and Nastassia Malthe proves it"<ref>[http://uk.stars.ign.com/articles/790/790831p1.html DOA: Dead or Alive Babe of the Day: Ayane], IGN, May 22, 2007</ref>).

===Controversy===
Some criticised the visual allure of the character, up to allegations of [[sexual objectification]].<ref>Amanda Greenslade, ''Fantasy Women: The Literary Roots of Phallocentrism in Modern Fantasy Computer Games''</ref> In 2009, GamesRadar ranked the series of Team Ninja's controversial ''Sigma 2'' commercials designed to draw attention to the fact that the "notoriously big-breasted" Ayane was a playable character (one of which was called by [[Destructoid]] "the best and worst thing to have ever been created")<ref>Jim Sterling, [http://www.destructoid.com/ninja-gaiden-sigma-2-boob-jiggle-commercial-is-amazing-148833.phtml Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 'boob jiggle' commercial is amazing], Destructoid, 09.16.2009</ref> as the fourth most blatantly [[sexism|sexist]] game advertisement ever, adding: "God forbid a moment goes by where any part of her body might be covered up."<ref>Joe Newman, [http://www.gamesradar.com/top-7-blatantly-sexist-game-advertisements/ Top 7...

As with Kasumi's, Ayane's age was not listed in the Western versions of the games<ref name=babes/> to avoid backlash regarding characters portrayed as [[Age of consent|underage]]; according to Itagaki, Ayane's age in ''Ninja Gaiden'' would "cause problems with the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]]."<ref name=masked/> Nevertheless, some outlets raised this issue and questioned the extent of [[Adolescence|adolescent]] Ayane's [[sexualization]] in the games (in ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2'' players were even given control over the movement of her breasts through use of the [[Sixaxis]] game controller).<ref name=motion/><ref name=sterling/> Destructoid's Jim Sterling has voiced concern about how a supposedly 14-year-old character (Ayane's ''NG Sigma 2'' age) has such "huge busters", as well as joking he was "worried that this now means I'm a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]]."<ref name=new>Jim Sterling, [http://www.destructoid.com/ng-sigma-2-14-year-old-has-huge-boobs-new-face-137912.phtml NG Sigma 2: 14-year-old has huge boobs, new face], Destructoid, 06.29.2009</ref>

In 2011, [[Nintendo|Nintendo of Europe]] decided to not distribute ''Dead or Alive: Dimensions'' in Sweden (this also meant the game would not be released in Norway and Denmark),<ref>[http://ds.mmgn.com/News/Dead-or-Alive-3DS-canceled-in-Sweden-ove Dead or Alive 3DS canceled in Sweden over...child porn laws?], MMGN, 25/05/2011</ref> apparently because of a local [[child pornography]] law encompassing drawn and animated characters (and despite the age of consent in Sweden being only 15).<ref>Brian Ashcraft, [http://kotaku.com/5803881/report-dead-or-alive-dimensions-is-kiddy-porn-in-sweden Report: Dead or Alive: Dimensions Is Kiddy Porn in Sweden?], Kotaku, May 20, 2011</ref> Reacting to it, Sterling (writing for [[GameFront]]) called her a "big-eyed lump of grade-A jailbait" and added "Would it murder the fantasy of the fanbase if the girl was canonically 21, despite still looking like an eleven-year-old hormone pill addict? [...] It would have the added benefit of narratives that are far more sensible <U+2014> having Ayane as an accomplished ninja at sixteen just doesn<U+2019>t make much sense."<ref name=sterling>Jim Sterling, [http://www.gamefront.com/japan-and-its-sexy-sexy-children/ Japan and its Sexy, Sexy Children ], GameFront, May 23, 2011</ref> [[ABC News]] mistakenly used GamesRadar's joke image of Ayane "with the newly-attached pterodactyl head and wings of ''[[Metroid]]'' boss [[Ridley (Metroid)|Ridley]]" as an illustration for their article while reporting on this story.<ref>Justin Towell, [http://www.gamesradar.com/abc-news-uses-our-ridiculous-big-boobed-pterodactyl-joke-as-serious-doa-screenshot/ ABC News uses our ridiculous big-boobed pterodactyl joke as serious DoA screenshot], GamesRadar, June 1, 2011</ref>
