[[Constitution of Algeria|Constitutionally]], it is defined as an [[Islam]]ic, [[Arab]], and [[Amazigh]] (Berber) country. The name Algeria is derived from the name of the city of [[Algiers]], from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''al-jaz<U+0101><U+2019>ir'', which translates as ''the islands'', referring to the four islands which lie off that city's coast until becoming part of the mainland in 1525; ''al-jaz<U+0101><U+2019>ir'' is itself short for the older name ''jaz<U+0101><U+2019>ir ban<U+012B> mazghann<U+0101>'', "the islands of (the tribe) Bani Mazghanna", used by early medieval geographers such as [[al-Idrisi]] and [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]].

==History==
{{main|History of Algeria}}

Algeria has been inhabited by [[Berber]]s (or Imazighen) since at least [[10,000 BC]]. From 1000 BC onwards, the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] became an influence on them, establishing settlements along the coast. Berber kingdoms began to emerge, most notably [[Numidia]], seizing the opportunity offered by the [[Punic Wars]] to become independent of Carthage only to be taken over soon after by the [[Roman Republic]] in 200 BC. As the western [[Roman Empire]] collapsed, the Berbers became independent again in much of the area, while the [[Vandals]] took over parts of the area until later expelled by the generals of the [[Byzantine Emperor]], [[Justinian I]]. The [[Byzantine Empire]] then retained a precarious grip on the east of the country until the coming of the [[Arab]]s in the 8th century.

[[Image:Roman Arch of Trajan at Thamugadi (Timgad), Algeria 04966r.jpg|thumb|left|Roman arch of Trajan at Thamugadi (Timgad), Algeria]]
After some decades of fierce resistance under leaders such as [[Kusayla]] and [[Kahina]], the Berbers adopted [[Islam]] ''en masse'', but almost immediately expelled the [[Caliphate]] from Algeria, establishing an [[Ibadi]] state under the [[Rustamid]]s. Having converted the [[Kutama]] of [[Kabylie]] to its cause, the [[Shia]] [[Fatimid]]s overthrew the Rustamids, and conquered Egypt. They left Algeria and Tunisia to their [[Zirid]] vassals; when the latter rebelled and adopted [[Sunni]]sm, they sent in a populous [[Arab]] tribe, the [[Banu Hilal]], to weaken them, thus incidentally initiating the [[Arabization]] of the countryside. The [[Almoravid]]s and [[Almohad]]s, Berber dynasties from the west founded by religious reformers, brought a period of relative peace and development; however, with the Almohads' collapse, Algeria became a battleground for their three [[successor state]]s, the Algerian [[Zayyanid]]s, Tunisian [[Hafsid]]s, and Moroccan [[Marinid]]s. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, [[Spain]] started attacking and taking over many coastal cities, prompting some to seek help from the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Algeria was brought into the Ottoman Empire by [[Khair ad Din|Khair ad-Din]] and his brother [[Aruj]], who established Algeria's modern boundaries in the north and made its coast a base for the [[Privateer|corsairs]]; their privateering peaked in Algiers in the 1600s. Piracy on American vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]] with the [[United States]]. On the pretext of a slight to their consul, the [[France|French]] invaded Algiers in 1830; however, intense resistance from such personalities as [[Emir Abdelkader]], [[Ahmed Bey]] and [[Lalla Fatma N'Soumer|Fatma N'Soumer]] made for a slow conquest of Algeria, not technically completed until the early 1900s when the last [[Tuareg]] were conquered.
[[Image:Constantine Algerien 002.jpg|thumb|left|Constantine, Algeria 1840]]

Meanwhile, however, the French made Algeria an integral part of France, a status that would end only with the collapse of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. Tens of thousands of settlers from France, Italy, Spain, and Malta moved in to farm the Algerian coastal plain and occupy the most prized parts of Algeria's cities, benefiting from the French government's confiscation of communally held land, and the application of modern agriculture techniques that increased the amount of arable land. People of European descent in Algeria (the so-called ''[[pied-noir|pieds-noirs]]''), as well as the native Algerian Jews, became full French citizens starting from the end of the 19th century; by contrast, the vast majority of Muslim Algerians (even veterans of the French army) received neither French citizenship nor the right to vote. Algeria's social fabric was stretched to breaking point during this period: literacy plummeted[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-365.html], while land confiscation uprooted much of the population. However, the population increased steadily[http://www.library.uu.nl/wesp/populstat/Africa/algeriac.htm].

In 1954, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) launched the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] [[Algerian War of Independence]]; after nearly a decade of urban and rural warfare, they succeeded in pushing France out in 1962. Most of the 1,025,000 ''[[pied-noir|pieds-noirs]]'', as well as 91,000 ''[[harki]]s'' (pro-French Muslim Algerians serving in the French Army), together forming about 10% of the population of Algeria in 1962, fled Algeria for France in just a few months in the middle of that year.

[[Image:TheBattleofAlgiers.png|thumb|right|''[[The Battle of Algiers]]'' is a movie about the [[Algerian War of Independence]].]]
Algeria's first president, the FLN leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], was overthrown by his former ally and defense minister, [[Houari Boum<U+00E9>di<U+00E8>nne]] in 1965. Under Ben Bella the government had already become increasingly socialist and dictatorial, and this trend continued throughout Boumedienne's government; however, Boumedienne relied much more heavily on the army, and reduced the sole legal party to a merely symbolic role. Agriculture was collectivised, and a massive industrialization drive launched. Oil extraction facilities were nationalized and this increased the state's wealth, especially after the 1973 oil crisis, but the Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, bringing hardship when the price collapsed in the 1980s. In foreign policy Algeria was a member and leader of the 'non-aligned' nations. A dispute with Morocco over the [[Western Sahara]] nearly led to war. Dissent was rarely tolerated, and the state's control over the media and the outlawing of political parties other than the FLN was cemented in the repressive constitution of 1976. Boum<U+00E9>dienne died in 1978, but the rule of his successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], was little more open. The state took on a strongly bureaucratic character and corruption was widespread.

The modernization drive brought considerable demographic changes to Algeria. Village traditions underwent significant change as urbanization increased, new industries emerged, agriculture was substantially reduced, and education, a rarity in colonial times, was extended nationwide, raising the literacy rate from less than 10% to over 60%. Improvements in healthcare led to a dramatic increase in the birthrate (7-8 children per mother) which had two consequences: a very youthful population, and a housing crisis. The new generation struggled to relate to the cultural obsession with the war years and two conflicting protest movements developed: left-wingers, including Berber identity movements, and Islamic 'int<U+00E9>gristes'. Both protested against one-party rule but also clashed with each other in universities and on the streets during the 1980s. Mass protests from both camps in autumn 1988 forced Benjedid to concede the end of one-party rule, and elections were announced for 1991.

In December 1991, the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] won the [[Algerian National Assembly elections, 1991|first round]] of the country's first multiparty elections. The military then canceled the second round, forced then-president Bendjedid to resign, and banned the Islamic Salvation Front. The ensuing conflict engulfed Algeria in the violent [[Algerian Civil War]]. More than 100,000 people were killed, often in unprovoked massacres of civilians. The question of who was responsible for these massacres remains controversial among academic observers; many were claimed by the [[Armed Islamic Group]]. After 1998, the war waned, and by 2002 the main guerrilla groups had either been destroyed or surrendered, taking advantage of an amnesty program, though sporadic fighting continued in some areas. Elections resumed in 1995, and on [[27 April]] 1999, after a series of short-term leaders representing the military, [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], the current president, was elected.<ref>[http://www.arab.de/arabinfo/algehis.htm Arabic German Consulting] www.arab.de (accessed [[04 April]], 2006)</ref> The issue of Berber language and identity increased in significance, particularly after the extensive [[Kabyle]] protests of 2001 and the near-total boycott of local elections in [[Kabylie]]; the government responded with concessions including naming of [[Tamazight]] (Berber) as a national language and teaching it in schools.
Much of Algeria is now recovering, developing into an emerging economy.  The high prices of oil & gas are being used by the new government to improve the county's infrastructure and specially improve industry and agriculture land.  Recent overseas investment in Algeria has increased.

==Politics==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Algeria}}
The head of state is the [[President of Algeria|President of the Republic]], who is elected to a 5-year term, renewable once. Algeria has [[universal suffrage]]. The President is the head of the Council of Ministers and of the High Security Council. He appoints the [[Prime Minister of Algeria|Prime Minister]] who is also the head of government. The Prime Minister appoints the Council of Ministers.

The Algerian [[parliament]] is bicameral, consisting of a lower chamber, the National People's Assembly (APN), with 380 members and an upper chamber, the Council of Nation, with 144 members. The APN is elected every 5 years.

Throughout the 1960s, Algeria supported many independence movements in sub-Saharan Africa, and was a leader in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. While it shares much of its history and cultural heritage with neighbouring [[Morocco]], the two countries have had somewhat hostile relations with each other ever since Algeria's independence. This is due to two reasons: Morocco's [[Greater Morocco|disputed claim to portions of western Algeria]] (which led to the [[Sand war]] in 1963), and Algeria's support for the [[Polisario]], an armed group of [[Sahrawi]] [[refugee]]s seeking [[independence]] for the Moroccan-ruled [[Western Sahara]], which it hosts within its borders in the city of [[Tindouf]]. Tensions between Algeria and Morocco, as well as issues relating to the [[Algerian Civil War]], have put great obstacles in the way of tightening the [[Maghreb Arab Union]], nominally established in 1989 but with little practical weight, with its coastal neighbors.<ref>[http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/990219/1999021906.html Bin Ali calls for reactivating Arab Maghreb Union, Tunisia-Maghreb, Politics, 2/19/1999] www.arabicnews.com (accessed [[04 April]], 2006) </ref>

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Algeria}}

{{MapLibrary|Algeria sat.jpg|Algeria|200px|Geographic map of Algeria.}}

[[Image:Hoggar3.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Ahaggar Mountains|Hoggar]] Mountains]]

Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are few good harbours. The area just south of the coast, known as the [[Tell]], is fertile. Further south is the [[Atlas mountains|Atlas mountain]] range and the [[Sahara]] desert. [[Algiers]], [[Oran]] and [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] are the main cities.

Algeria's [[climate]] is arid and hot, although the coastal climate is mild, and the winters in the mountainous areas can be severe. Algeria is prone to [[sirocco]], a hot dust- and sand-laden wind especially common in summer.<ref name=cia/>

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Algeria}}

[[Image:Algernuit.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Algiers]] is the capital and economic hub of Algeria.]]
The fossil fuels energy sector is the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], and over 95% of export earnings. It ranks 14th in [[Petroleum]] reserves, containing 11.8 billion barrels of proven oil reserves with estimates suggesting that the actual amount is even more.<ref name=eia/> The Energy Information Administration reported that in 2005, Algeria had 160 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of proven [[natural gas]] reserves, the 8th largest in the world.

Algeria<U+2019>s financial and economic indicators improved during the mid-1990s, in part because of policy reforms supported by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[debt]] rescheduling from the [[Paris Club]]. Algeria<U+2019>s finances in 2000 and 2001 benefited from an increase in [[oil]] prices and the government<U+2019>s tight fiscal policy, leading to a large increase in the trade surplus, record highs in foreign exchange reserves, and reduction in [[foreign debt]]. The government's continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic [[investment]] outside the energy sector has had little success in reducing high [[unemployment]] and improving living standards. In 2001, the government signed an Association Treaty with the [[European Union]] that will eventually lower tariffs and increase trade. In March 2006, [[Russia]] agreed to erase $4.74 billion of Algeria's [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era debt during a visit by [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] to the country, the first by a Russian leader in half a century. In return, president [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] agreed to buy $7.5 billion worth of combat planes, air-defence systems and other arms from Russia, according to the head of Russia's state arms exporter [[Rosoboronexport]].

Algeria also decided in 2006 to pay off its full $8bn (<U+00A3>4.3bn) debt to the [[Paris Club]] group of rich creditor nations before schedule. This will reduce the Algerian foreign debt to less than $5bn in the end of 2006. The [[Paris Club]] said the move reflected Algeria's economic recovery in recent years. Rich in oil and gas, it has benefited from high energy prices.<ref> {{cite news | title=Russia agrees Algeria arms deal, writes off debt | publisher=Reuters | date=[[March 11]] [[2006]] | url=http://za.today.reuters.com/news/NewsArticle.aspx?type=businessNews&storyID=2006-03-11T082958Z_01_BAN130523_RTRIDST_0_OZABS-ECONOMY-RUSSIA-ALGERIA-20060311.XML}} </ref><ref> {{fr}} {{cite news | title=La Russie efface la dette alg<U+00E9>rienne | publisher=Radio France International | date=[[March 10]] [[2006]] | url=http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/075/article_42379.asp}} </ref>

==Demographics==
[[Image:Algiers coast.jpg|thumb|[[Algiers]] coast]]
{{main|Demographics of Algeria}}

About 70% of Algerians live in the northern, coastal area; the minority who inhabit the [[Sahara desert]] are mainly concentrated in [[oasis|oases]], although some 1.5 million remain [[nomad]]ic or partly nomadic.

Ninety-nine percent of the population is classified ethnically as [[Arab]]/[[Berber]], and religiously as [[Muslim]]; other religions are restricted to extremely small groups, mainly of foreigners. Europeans account for less than 1%.<ref name=cia/>

During the colonial period there was a large European (primarily French) [[pied-noir]] population, concentrated on the coast and forming a majority in certain cities. Almost all of this population left during or immediately after Independence from France.

Most Algerians are Arab by language and identity, and of mixed Berber-Arab ancestry.<ref name=cia/> The Berbers inhabited Algeria before the arrival of Arab tribes during the expansion of Islam, in the 7th century. The issue of ethnicity and language is sensitive after many years of government marginalization of Berber (or Imazighen, as some prefer) culture. Today, the Arab-Berber issue is often a case of self-identification or identification through language and culture, rather than a racial or ethnic distinction. The 20% or so of the population who self-identify as Berbers, and primarily speak [[Berber languages]] (also termed [[Tamazight]]), are divided into several ethnic groups, notably [[Kabyle]] (the largest) in the mountainous north-central area, [[Chaoui]] in the eastern [[Atlas Mountains]], [[Mozabite]]s in the [[M'zab]] valley, and [[Tuareg]] in the far south.

==Language==
{{main|Languages of Algeria}}

Algeria's largest and official [[language]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], is spoken natively in [[dialect]]al form ("[[Algerian Arabic|Darja]]") by some 80% of the population, and, as in the entire [[Arab world]], used in the [[Modern Standard Arabic]] variant in the [[News media|media]] and on official occasions. Some 20% of the population, identified as [[Berber]]s or [[Imazighen]], are native speakers not of Arabic, but of some dialect of [[Tamazight]]. Many Algerians are however fluent in both languages to some degree. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] remains Algeria's only [[official language]], although [[Tamazight]] has recently been recognized as a [[national language]] alongside it. The [[Ethnologue]] counts 18 living languages within Algeria, splitting both Arabic and Tamazight into several different languages, as well as mentioning the unrelated [[Korandje language]].<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=DZ Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Online version: http://www.ethnologue.com/] (accessed [[04 April]], 2006) </ref>

The language issue is politically sensitive, particularly for the Berber [[minority]], which has been disadvantaged by state-sanctioned [[Arabization]]. Language politics and Arabization have partly been a reaction to the fact that 130 years of [[France|French]] [[colonialism|colonization]] had left both the state [[bureaucracy]] and much of the educated upper class completely [[Francophone]], as well as being motivated by the [[Arab nationalism]] promoted by successive Algerian governments.

[[French language|French]] is still the most widely studied [[foreign language]], and widely spoken (distantly followed by [[English language|English]]), but very rare as a [[native language]]. Since [[independence]], the government has pursued a policy of linguistic Arabization of [[education]] and bureaucracy, with some success, although many [[university]] courses continue to be taught in French.

==Culture==
[[Image:Algiers mosque.jpg|thumb|[[Mosque]] in Algiers]]
{{main|Culture of Algeria}}

Modern Algerian literature, split between Arabic and French, has been strongly influenced by the country's recent history. [[List of Algerian writers|Famous novelists]] of the 20th century include [[Mohammed Dib]], [[Albert Camus]], and [[Kateb Yacine]], while [[Assia Djebar]] is widely translated. Important novelists of the 1980s included [[Rachid Mimouni]], later vice-president of Amnesty International, and [[Tahar Djaout]], murdered by an [[Islamist]] group in 1993 for his secularist views.<ref>[http://www.frenchpubagency.com/?fuseaction=people.main&pid=517 Tahar Djaout] French Publishers' Agency and France Edition, Inc. (accessed [[04 April]], 2006) </ref> As early as Roman times, [[Apuleius]], born in [[Mdaourouch]], was native to what would become Algeria.

In philosophy and the humanities, [[Malek Bennabi]] and [[Frantz Fanon]] are noted for their thoughts on [[decolonization]], while [[Augustine of Hippo]] was born in [[Tagaste]] (about 60 miles from the present day city of [[Annaba]]), and [[Ibn Khaldun]], though born in [[Tunis]], wrote the [[Muqaddima]] while staying in Algeria.

Algerian culture has been strongly influenced by [[Islam in Algeria|Islam]], the main religion. The works of the [[Sanusi]] family in pre-colonial times, and of Emir [[Abdelkader]] and Sheikh [[Ben Badis]] in colonial times, are widely noted.

The [[Music of Algeria|Algerian musical]] genre best known abroad is [[ra<U+00EF>]], a pop-flavored, opinionated take on folk music, featuring international stars such as [[Khaled (musician)|Khaled]] and [[Cheb Mami]]. However, in Algeria itself the older, highly verbal [[chaabi]] style remains more popular, with such stars as [[El Hadj El Anka]] or [[Dahmane El Harrachi]], while the tuneful melodies of [[Kabyle]] music, exemplified by [[Idir]], [[Ait Menguellet]], or [[Loun<U+00E8>s Matoub]], have a wide audience. For more classical tastes, [[Andalusian classical music|Andalusi music]], brought from [[Al-Andalus]] by [[Morisco]] refugees, is preserved in many older coastal towns.
