The '''Podhale dialect''' ({{lang-pl|gwara podhala<U+0144>ska}}) is a [[subdialect]] (''gwara'') spoken by the [[Gorals]], or the highlanders living in the [[Tatra Mountains]]. The dialect, itself a part of the larger [[Lesser Polish dialect]]al group, is characterized as [[Proto-Slavic]] from the Eastern [[Lechitic]], Old [[Polish language|Polish]] area, superimposed by [[Slovak language|Slovak]]. {{fact|date=June 2012}}

In other words, the language is of Polish origin, but has been influenced by Slovak in recent centuries. The language contains Polish, Vlach and Slovak vocabulary, as well as unique words and words that are peculiar to the Carpathian language area ([[Carpathism]]s).{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s 1900 novel ''The Teutonic Knights'', the author had his characters speak a variety of medieval Polish which he recreated by utilizing many of the archaic expressions then still common among the highlanders of Podhale.{{fact|date=June 2012}}
