"'''Let Yourself Go'''" is a song by American [[punk rock]] band [[Green Day]]. Written by [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] and produced by [[Rob Cavallo]] and the band for their ninth studio album, ''[[<U+00A1>Uno!]]'', the song was released as the third single from the album on September 5, 2012. However, the "official live video" of the song was revealed on August 1, 2012. 

The song was described to be "more punk" than that of the band's previous two singles "[[Oh Love]]" and "[[Kill the DJ]]", and was compared to their 1990's material, such as ''[[Dookie]]'' and ''[[Insomniac (Green Day album)|Insomniac]]''. Its theme was described as "the kind of pop-smart here's-my-fucking-problem miniatures". It received positive critical reception and charted at #2 at [[UK Rock Chart]] and #19 at US [[Alternative Rock]]. "Let Yourself Go" was played at secret shows of the band and at the [[2012 MTV Video Music Awards]].

[[David Fricke]] of the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in a review of ''<U+00A1>Uno!'' compared the theme of the song with "Stay the Night", another song on the album, stating; "'Stay the Night' and 'Let Yourself Go' are the kind of pop-smart here's-my-fucking-problem miniatures Armstrong was writing like second nature when he, [[Mike Dirnt|Dirnt]] and [[Tr<U+00E9> Cool|Cool]] were too young to drink (legally) where they gigged. But Armstrong is 40 now, married and a dad, and a lot of this ruckus sounds designed to drown out the time bombs ticking in his head and the maddening static outside".<ref>{{cite web|last=Fricke|first=David|title=Green Day|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/uno-20120913|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|accessdate=September 17, 2012}}</ref>
