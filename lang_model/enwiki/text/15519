Smith]] as the Director of State and Federal Relations in [[Washington, D.C.]] Pendleton was also a deputy commissioner for the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife. He served as executive assistant to the commissioner of the Board of Public Welfare. He was a lobbyist for the [[Beneficial Corporation]]<ref name=obit>{{cite web|url=http://www.cemetery.state.tx.us/pub/user_form.asp?pers_id=2916|title=Randall George Pendleton obituary|publisher=cemetery.state.tx.us|accessdate=December 17, 2010}}</ref> and in that capacity worked for passage of the November 4, 1997 state constitutional amendment allowing home-equity lending in Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/homeeqty03/|title=Home Equity Lending Gaps in Texas|publisher=window.state.tx.us|accessdate=December 17, 2010}}</ref> Pendleton was a board member of the Austin Club.<ref name=obit/>

Pendleton served in District 73 from 1967<U+2013>1969; in District 75, 1961<U+2013>1966. He tendered his resignation to accept the appointment in Washington, effective June 30, 1969.

In 1972, Pendleton returned to the political arena to run, unsuccessfully, against the long-term incumbent [[Robert S. Calvert]] for [[Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts]], who won the last of his two-year terms. Pendleton accused Calvert of having mishandled [[sales tax]] collections, a situation which led to declining state revenues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth82447/m1/2/|title=''The Bartlett Tribune and News'', Bartlett, Texas|publisher=texashistory.unt.eud|accessdate=December 17, 2010}}</ref> Two years later, Calvert withdrew from the Democratic primary when faced with the strong challenge of [[Bob Bullock]], a former [[Texas Secretary of State]] who would serve as comptroller from 1975<U+2013>1991, when he became [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas]].

He was survived by his wife of fifty-two years, the former Frances Ann Guillet (born 1936), the daughter of  the former Bernice Guillet (1908<U+2013>1997) and Henry F.
