{{Long Island}}
Long Island's [[commuter town]]s are well known for supplying skilled labor to more urban places, but its four counties have their own factories, offices, schools and other workplaces, employing more workers than commute to distant jobs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

== Affluence ==
The counties of [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] have long been renowned for their affluence and high standard of living. This affluence is especially pervasive among the hamlets and villages on the [[North Shore (Long Island)|North Shore of Long Island]], the extreme eastern South Shore (home to [[the Hamptons]]) and several wealthy pockets along the South Shore further west. However, nearly all of Long Island (especially Nassau County and western Suffolk County) is quite expensive to live on by national standards.

Long Island is home to some of the most expensive [[mansion]]s in the country. In 2005, the most expensive residence in the country was '''Three Ponds''' in [[Bridgehampton, New York|Bridgehampton]].<ref>{{cite web | title=The Most Expensive Homes in America <U+2014> Special Edition <U+2014> Yahoo! Finance|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/special/exphomes05_article1.html|accessdate=December 5, 2005 }}</ref>  Several of the nation's largest private residences are also on Long Island, including financier [[Ira Rennert|Ira Rennert's]], '''Fair Field''', in the Hampton's hamlet of [[Sagaponack, New York|Sagaponack]] and the country's second largest home, [[Oheka Castle]].  Long Island is home to the luxury communities of [[the Hamptons]], [[Cold Spring Harbor, New York|Cold Spring Harbor]], Dix Hills, Centerport, Babylon Village, Huntington Bay, and  [[Lloyd Harbor, New York|Lloyd Harbor]] in Suffolk County, and [[Hewlett Bay Park, New York|Hewlett Bay Park]], [[Cove Neck, New York|Cove Neck]], [[Oyster Bay Cove, New York|Oyster Bay Cove]], [[Laurel Hollow, New York|Laurel Hollow]], Sands Point, Roslyn, Glen Head, Brookville, Muttontown, Syosset, Woodbury, Jericho,  [[Hewlett Harbor, New York|Hewlett Harbor]], and [[Manhasset, New York|Manhasset]] in Nassau County.

== Aviation industry ==
Long Island industry has long benefited from its proximity to New York City. During the 1930s, the island developed an aviation industry, and until about 1990 was considered one of the aviation centers of the United States, with companies such as [[Grumman Aircraft]] having their headquarters and factories in the [[Bethpage, New York|Bethpage]] area. [[Grumman]] was long a major supplier of warplanes for the [[U.S. Navy]] and the [[Marine Corps]], as seen in many movies. Prominent WW-II Grumman aircraft included the [[F4F Wildcat|F4F ''Wildcat'']] and [[F6F Hellcat|F6F ''Hellcat'']] fighters, and the [[TBF Avenger|TBF ''Avenger'']] bomber.  Grumman was also prominent in the US space program, being the producer of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Apollo Lunar Excursion Module]].

In their early decades, aerospace-related companies were concentrated on Long Island, especially in eastern Nassau County in the Bethpage area. Over the years, the industry also diversified to other locations. The [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry Gyroscope]] company did very well during WW-II as military demand skyrocketed; it specialized in high technology devices such as [[gyrocompass]]es, [[analog computer]]-controlled bombsights, airborne [[radar]] systems, and automated take-off and landing systems. These became jumping-off points into the multibillion-dollar annually [[avionics]] business. During the [[Cold War]] decade of the 1950s, part of Sperry Gyroscope was moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. This was to try to preserve parts of this vital defense company in the event of [[nuclear warfare]]. Both on Long Island and in Arizona, Sperry continued to excel in [[avionics]], and it also provided avionics systems for such [[NASA]] programs as the [[Space Shuttle]].

The [[Cradle of Aviation Museum]] illustrates and celebrates Long Island aviation.

== Science and engineering ==

Long Island has played a prominent role in scientific research and in engineering. It was the home of the [[Grumman Aircraft]] factories where all the [[Apollo program]] [[Lunar Module]] spacecraft were built; and it still is the home of the [[Brookhaven National Laboratories]] in [[nuclear physics]] and [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] research. All of this makes Long Island one of the leading high-technology areas in the world.

Late in the 20th century companies such as [[Sperry Rand]] and [[CA, Inc.|Computer Associates]], headquartered in [[Islandia, New York|Islandia]], made Long Island a center for the computer industry. [[Gentiva Health Services]], a national provider of home health and pharmacy services, also is headquartered in Long Island.

Long Island was home to the first Trans-Atlantic radio broadcast, from [[Rocky Point, New York]] to Paris, France.

== Agriculture ==

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Vinyard Map.jpg|thumb|right|200px|<center>Long Island East -end Vinyard Map]] -->
Long Island, NY is rich in farming history and features many produce farms located on both the North Shore and South Shores. Because the western and central regions of the island are now largely devoted to residential use, the East End of the island is now the primary agricultural area of Long Island.

East End [[farm]]s and farmers' markets are the major providers of Long Island's remaining supplies of locally grown [[fruit]]s, [[berry|berries]], [[vegetable]]s, [[poultry]], and [[dairy products]].  Some farms offer pick-your-own [[peach]]es, [[apple]]s, and [[pumpkin]]s.
[http://www.citidexli.com/6294.htm]  This has become a traditional spring, summer, and fall outing for many Long Island residents.  [http://longisland.about.com/od/seasonalevents/a/u_pick_it.htm] The island also still has a considerable area and resources even in Nassau County devoted to landscaping horticulture.

===Long Island wine===
In little over quarter of a century the Long Island [[wine]] industry has grown from one vineyard to {{convert|3000|acre|km2}} of vines in thirty wineries. The island's maritime climate, geography and soil characteristics provide good winegrowing conditions.

The Long Island [[Long Island AVA|wine region]] formally encompasses all of Nassau County and Suffolk County, but most island [[vineyards]] are located on the North and South Forks.  Some of the vineyards can grow [[varietal|Euopean varietal grapes]], while others concentrate on hybrid grapes that are better-adapted to North American conditions of climate and pest resistance.[http://www.liwines.com/default.ihtml?page=theregion]

== News and media ==

== Tourism ==

Tourism thrives primarily in the summer and on the East End because of the natural beauty, parks and beaches in Long Island. The [[North Fork, Suffolk County, New York|North fork]] on the east end of Suffolk County is known for fishing villages, quaint towns, ferries to [[Connecticut]] and other neighbors, and for wineries. The [[South Fork, Suffolk County, New York|South fork]] has similar [[tourist attraction]]s including golf, equestrian, boating, surfing, and fine dining in [[the Hamptons]] and Montauk. [[Patchogue]] is also host to the Patchogue Theatre for the Performing Arts, which is also the official home theater of the [http://www.atlanticwinds.org/ Atlantic Wind Symphony].
[[Image:Long Island Sunrise; Quogue.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Sunrise in Quogue.]]
Villages are significant additional [[tourist attraction]] for the Island. Some tourism is local Long Islanders simply visiting nearby friendly villages. Examples of well developed villages that attract surrounding communities are Huntington Village, Northport Village, Islip Hamlet, Port Jefferson Village, Sayville, & Cold Spring Harbor in Suffolk County. Roslyn Village, [[Great Neck]], The City of Long Beach, The City of Glen Cove, Massapequa Park and Rockville Centre, [[Garden City, New York|Garden City]] are popular Nassau County Villages. The [http://www.discoverlongisland.com Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau] provides information about tourism on Long Island.

== Other industries ==

[[Fishing]] continues to be an important industry, especially at [[Northport, New York|Northport]] and [[Montauk, New York|Montauk]].

Since World War II, Long Island has become increasingly suburban and, in some areas, fully urbanized. [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]] was only the first of many new suburbs, and businesses followed residential development eastward.

Long Island is home to the East Coast's largest industrial park, the Hauppauge Industrial Park. The park has over 1,300 companies, and employs over 55,000 Long Islanders. Companies in the park and abroad are represented by the [[Hauppauge Industrial Association]].

A growing entertainment industry presence can also be found on the Island. Most recently producer [[Mitchell Kriegman]] established [[Wainscott Studios]] in [[Water Mill, New York|Water Mill]] where the [[PBS]] children's show, <U+201C>[[It's a Big Big World]]<U+201D>, is shot.
