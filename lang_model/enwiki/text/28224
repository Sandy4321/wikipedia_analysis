"'''Day of the Jackanapes'''" is the thirteenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 12)|twelfth season]]. It first aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the [[United States]] on February&nbsp;18,&nbsp;2001. In the episode, [[Krusty]] announces his retirement due to interference from network executives and the growing popularity of the game show ''Me Wantee''. But when Krusty reveals to [[Sideshow Bob]] that all of the episodes featuring him have been erased, Sideshow Bob uses Bart to try and murder Krusty during his farewell show.

"Day of the Jackanapes" was written by [[Al Jean]] and directed by [[Michael Marcantel]] and features recurring guest star [[Kelsey Grammer]] as [[Sideshow Bob]], as well as [[Gary Coleman]] as himself. It features references to [[Johnny Carson]], ''[[Bookends]]'' and ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', among other things. It would also feature a parody of the song "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]", but because the series' staff were not able to clear the rights for the song in time for the episode's broadcast, the song remained unreleased until 2007. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 9 million viewers, finishing in 34th place in the ratings the week it aired. Following its broadcast, the episode received positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
When the popular game show ''Me Wantee!'' steals ratings from ''The [[Krusty the Clown]] Show'', Krusty, annoyed with the network executives, announces that he will quit showbusiness for good. During an interview with [[List of recurring characters from The Simpsons#Kent Brockman|Kent Brockman]], he says he is tired of doing his show, and admits to taping ''[[Judge Judy]]'' over all his old shows featuring [[Sideshow Bob]]. Upon hearing this on TV, Bob vows revenge and plots to kill Krusty. Bob is released from prison and applies for a job at [[Springfield Elementary School|Springfield Elementary]] as an assistant janitor. However, [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]] decides to make him the morning announcer. Over the announcements, he asks [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] to meet him in the abandoned tool shed. Sideshow Bob bounds Bart, then [[Hypnosis|hypnotizes]] and programs him to smash a statue of Krusty at a local Krusty Burger location. 

The next night on Krusty's farewell special, Krusty describes the history of his career, Bob straps Bart with explosives in order to kill Krusty. Bart attempts to hug Krusty, thereby setting off the explosives, but before he can, Krusty talks to the audience about how he regrets mistreating Sideshow Bob, holding himself responsible of turning Bob into a ruthless criminal. (from season 1's episode Krusty gets busted) Krusty even goes far by singing a song on behalf of Bob, stating how very remorseful he is of mistreating him. Upon witnessing this, Bob is touched and develops a change of heart, but does not have time to stop his original plan from being carried out. Luckily, Krusty's trained chimp [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Mr. Teeny|Mr. Teeny]] sees the life-threatening explosives, which he throws into the network executives' office, killing all the executives, though they would later reanimate themselves like the [[T-1000]] from ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day|Terminator 2]]''. Bart comes out of his hypnotic state and he and his family serve dinner with Krusty, Bob and Sideshow Mel in a restaurant. Although Krusty and Bob reconcile, police decide to execute Bob by [[guillotine]] for his plot of attempted murder, although he argues with [[Chief Wiggum]] that he should have a trial for it at least.

==Production==
The first draft of "Day of the Jackanapes" was written by current showrunner [[Al Jean]]. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Jean said that he had always wanted to write an episode about Sideshow Bob, and that "Day of the Jackanapes" would be a good way to have the character return. He also said that the writers wanted to work with [[Kelsey Grammer]], who portrays Sideshow Bob, again. "Of all the guest stars we've had who've been great, he's right up there as the very best", he said.<ref name="Jean">Jean, Al. (2009). Commentary for "Day of the Jackanapes", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Still, the writers had trouble with coming up with a story for Sideshow Bob since they had already explored several aspects of the character before. "It's just that we've done so many angles of whether he's, he's good, he's reformed and then his brother came to town..." executive producer and former showrunner [[Mike Scully]] said about the difficulty of writing episodes about Sideshow Bob.<ref name="Scully" />

At the beginning of the episode, Krusty is shown being pestered by network executives who comment on every choice he makes. He announces his departure from the ''Krusty the Klown Show'' after the executives give him notes during filming of a sketch. At the end of the episode, Mr Teeny is uncertain of where he should throw the plastic explosives that Bart wore. When he sees the two executives discussing in a room, he throws it onto them. Instead of dying of the explosion however, the pieces of the executives reconstitute into what Jean describes as a "super-executive". These sequences were inspired by Jean's dissatisfaction with some network executives, who he felt took control over a television series he was working on before he returned to ''The Simpsons'' in 1999. "I had just worked on a show on another network [...] we had a show where there were a lot of notes from executives", Jean said of the inspiration for the scenes.<ref name="Jean" /> The episode would originally have a different ending, but it was changed to its current iteration after the writers did not find the original ending humorous enough. When recording the DVD commentary however, Jean said that he was a bit dissatisfied with the new ending. "I think we did leave it a little hanging", he said.<ref name="Jean" />

During one of the recording sessions for the episode, ''The Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> staff recorded "Hullaba Lula", a version of the 1946 song "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" with Grammer as Sideshow Bob on vocals. The song would originally be used in the episode, but the staff were not able to clear the rights for the song in time.<ref name="Jean" /> It was therefore removed from the episode altogether, and remained unreleased until September 17, 2007, when it was included as a bonus track on the [[soundtrack album]] ''[[The Simpsons: Testify]]''. Aside from Grammer, the episode also features American actor [[Gary Coleman]] as himself.<ref name="Selman">Selman, Matt. (2009).

==Cultural references==
The plot of "Day of the Jackanapes" is based on the 1959 political thriller novel ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]''.<ref name="Jean" /> Before filming an episode of his show, Krusty is stopped by the two network executives, who attempt to explain to him why the sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' worked as a series.<ref name="Long">Long, Tim.

The name of the studio is based on [[Desilu Productions|Desilu Studios]], a television company based in [[Los Angeles]]. In an interview with Kent Brockman, Krusty says that he taped over all episodes of his show that Sideshow Bob was in with episodes of the [[Judge show|reality court show]] ''[[Judge Judy]]''. This is a reference to how [[NBC]] reused tapes of early episodes of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' to film new programs.<ref name="Jean" />

At one point in his last show, Krusty performs while sitting on a stool, a reference to television host [[Johnny Carson]]'s last appearance on ''The Tonight Show''. While watching Krusty's final show, Sideshow Bob holds a bag of [[Kettle Chips]] and says "Kettle Chips, the perfect side dish for revenge." Because of this scene, the writing staff received several bags of Kettle Chips from Kettle Foods, according to Jean. When asking for Sideshow Bob's forgiveness, Krusty sings a song to the tune of "[[Mandy (song)|Mandy]]" by [[Barry Manilow]]. The picture behind him is based on the cover of ''[[Bookends]]'' by [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. After having exploded, the two network executives reform into a "super-executive". The scene is a reference to the 1991 science fiction action film ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''.<ref name="Jean" /> At the end of the episode, Krusty and Sideshow Bob reconcile in a restaurant.
