'''Leslie O'Brien 'Chuck' Fleetwood-Smith''' (born [[March 30]], [[1908]], [[Stawell, Victoria]], died [[March 16]], [[1971]], [[Fitzroy, Victoria]]) was an [[Australia]]n [[cricket]]er who played in 10 [[Test cricket|Tests]] from 1935 to 1938. 

Fleetwood-Smith holds the unenviable record of having the most expensive innings bowling figures in Test cricket history: playing against [[English cricket team|England]] at [[The Oval]] in 1938, he finished with the somewhat startling [[bowling analysis|analysis]] of 87-11-298-1.

Fleetwood-Smith, played in 10 Test matches for Australia between 1935 and 1938, taking 42 wickets. A left-arm spin bowler, he often exploited the googly and the "chinaman" with effect. In all first-class cricket his record was 597 wickets, average 22.00. "Chuck", as he was known, first toured England in 1934 when he obtained 119 wickets (including three in four deliveries against Oxford University) at 18.06 runs each, yet couldn't win a Test place in front of two of Australia's greatest ever spin bowlers, Clarrie Grimmett and Bill O'Reilly.

However, in 1936-37, following a reasonably successful tour of South Africa where he made his test debut, he was a key player in Australia's retention of the Ashes. After the loss of the first two Tests (which he didn't play) to "Gubby" Allen's England team, Australia recovered to win the last three Tests, a unique performance in Test match history. Fleetwood-Smith's great moment came in the fourth Test at Melbourne with match figures of 10 for 239 runs. On the tour of England in 1938, he played in four Tests, at Leeds taking match figures of 7 for 107 and partnering O'Reilly (10 for 122) as the major factor in the victory which decided the rubber.

The final match of the series at The Oval, his last Test appearance, Fleetwood-Smith suffered a record flogging as the Australian bowlers conceded a world record score of 903. England's Len Hutton scored a record-breaking 364 as England won by the overwhelming margin of an innings and 579 runs. Fleetwood-Smith's analysis was one wicket for 298 runs from 87 overs.

For Victoria, Fleetwood-Smith captured 246 wickets at 24.56 apiece in 40 Sheffield Shield matches, and twice took nine wickets in an innings - for 36 runs against Tasmania in 1932-33 and for 135 runs against South Australia five seasons later. Later in life, Fleetwood-Smith's life spiralled out of control and he was homeless and alcoholic, living on the streets of central Melbourne. Friends rallied to help him and he stopped drinking, returning to live with his formerly estranged wife in the last two years of his life.
