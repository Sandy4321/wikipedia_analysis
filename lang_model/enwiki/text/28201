'''Copper''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|k|<U+0252>|p|<U+0259>r}} {{respell|KOP|<U+0259>r}}) is a [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Cu''' (from {{lang-la|cuprum}}) and [[atomic number]] 29. It is a [[ductility|ductile]] metal with very high [[thermal conductivity|thermal]] and [[electrical conductivity]]. Pure copper is soft and malleable; an exposed surface has a reddish-orange tarnish. It is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, a building material, and a constituent of various metal [[alloy]]s.

The metal and [[list of copper alloys|its alloys]] have been used for thousands of years. In the Roman era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus, hence the origin of the name of the metal as ''<U+0441>yprium'' (metal of Cyprus), later shortened to ''<U+0441>uprum''. Its compounds are commonly encountered as copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to minerals such as [[turquoise]] and have been widely used historically as pigments. Architectural structures built with copper corrode to give green [[verdigris]]. [[Decorative art]] prominently features copper, both by itself and as part of pigments.

Copper(II) ions are water-soluble, where they function at low concentration as [[bacteriostatic agent|bacteriostatic substances]], [[fungicide]]s, and wood preservatives. In sufficient amounts, they are poisonous to higher organisms; at lower concentrations it is an essential trace [[nutrient]] to all [[higher plant]] and animal life. The main areas where copper is found in animals are tissues, liver, muscle and bone.

===Chemical===
[[File:Copper wire comparison.JPG|left|thumb|Unoxidized copper wire (left) and oxidized copper wire (right).]]

Copper forms a rich variety of compounds with [[oxidation state]]s +1 and +2, which are often called ''cuprous'' and ''cupric'', respectively.<ref name="Holleman"/> It does not react with water, but it slowly reacts with atmospheric oxygen forming a layer of brown-black copper oxide. In contrast to the oxidation of iron by wet air, this oxide layer stops the further, bulk corrosion. A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper constructions, such as the [[Statue of Liberty]], the largest copper statue in the world build using [[repouss<U+00E9> and chasing]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Copper.org: Education: Statue of Liberty: Reclothing the First Lady of Metals <U+2013> Repair Concerns|url=http://www.copper.org/education/liberty/liberty_reclothed1.html|work=Copper.org|accessdate=11 April 2011}}</ref> [[Hydrogen sulfide]]s and [[sulfide]]s react with copper to form various [[copper sulfide]]s on the surface.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of copper}}
There are 29 [[isotope]]s of copper. <sup>63</sup>Cu and <sup>65</sup>Cu are stable, with <sup>63</sup>Cu comprising approximately 69% of naturally occurring copper; they both have a [[spin (physics)|spin]] of 3/2.<ref name="nubase">{{cite journal|title=Nubase2003 Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=729|page=3|publisher=Atomic Mass Data Center|year=2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|author=Audi, G}}</ref> The other isotopes are [[radioactivity|radioactive]], with the most stable being <sup>67</sup>Cu with a [[half-life]] of 61.83&nbsp;hours.<ref name="nubase"/> Seven [[nuclear isomer|metastable isotopes]] have been characterized, with <sup>68m</sup>Cu the longest-lived with a half-life of 3.8 minutes.

===Occurrence===
Copper can be found as either [[native copper]] or as part of minerals.

Most copper is mined or [[copper extraction techniques|extracted]] as copper sulfides from large [[open pit mine]]s in [[porphyry copper]] deposits that contain 0.4 to 1.0% copper. Examples include [[Chuquicamata]] in Chile, [[Bingham Canyon Mine]] in Utah, United States and [[El Chino Mine]] in New Mexico, United States. According to the [[British Geological Survey]], in 2005, Chile was the top mine producer of copper with at least one-third world share followed by the United States, Indonesia and Peru.<ref name=CRC/> The amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available is barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/103/5/1209.full|title=Metal stocks and sustainability|journal=PNAS|year=2006|volume=103|issue=5|pages=1209<U+2013>1214|first1=R.

===Reserves===
Copper has been in use at least 10,000 years, but more than 95% of all copper ever mined and [[smelting|smelted]] has been extracted since 1900. As with many natural resources, the total amount of copper on Earth is vast (around 10<sup>14</sup> tons just in the top kilometer of Earth's crust, or about 5 million years worth at the current rate of extraction). However, only a tiny fraction of these reserves is economically viable, given present-day prices and technologies. Various estimates of existing copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 years to 60 years, depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brown, Lester|title=Plan B 2.0: Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble|publisher=New York: W.W.

The price of copper has historically been unstable,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=Christopher|title=The Rise of Big Business in the World, Copper Industry 1870-1930|journal=Economic History Review|year=1986|month=August|volume=39|series=2|issue=3|pages=392-410|id={{JSTOR|2596347}}}}</ref> and it quintupled from the 60-year low of US$0.60/lb (US$1.32/kg) in June 1999 to US$3.75 per pound (US$8.27/kg) in May 2006.

===Methods===
The concentration of copper in ores averages only 0.6%, and most commercial ores are sulfides, especially chalcopyrite (CuFeS<sub>2</sub>) and to a lesser extent chalcocite (Cu<sub>2</sub>S).<ref name=G&E/> These minerals are concentrated from [[comminution|crushed]] ores to the level of 10-15% copper by [[froth flotation]] or [[bioleaching]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Watling|first=H. R.|title=The bioleaching of sulphide minerals with emphasis on copper sulphides <U+2014> A review|journal=Hydrometallurgy|year=2006|month=October|volume=84|issue=1, 2|pages=81<U+2013>108|url=http://infolib.hua.edu.vn/Fulltext/ChuyenDe/ChuyenDe07/CDe53/59.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Heating this material with silica in [[flash smelting]] removes much of the iron as slag. The process exploits the greater ease of converting iron sulfides into its oxides, which in turn react with the silica to form the silicate slag, which floats on top of the heated mass. The resulting ''copper matte'' consisting of Cu<sub>2</sub>S is then [[roasting (metallurgy)|roasted]] to convert all sulfides into oxides:<ref name=G&E>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd}}</ref>
:2 Cu<sub>2</sub>S + 3 O<sub>2</sub>  <U+2192> 2 Cu<sub>2</sub>O + 2 SO<sub>2</sub>
The cuprous oxide is converted to ''blister'' copper upon heating:
:2 Cu<sub>2</sub>O <U+2192> 4 Cu + O<sub>2</sub>
This step exploits the relatively easy reduction of copper oxides to copper metal.  Natural gas is blown across the blister to remove most of the remaining oxygen and [[electrorefining]] is performed on the resulting material to produce pure copper:<ref>{{cite book|last=Samans|first=Carl|title=Engineering metals and their alloys|year=1949|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|oclc=716492542}}</ref> 
:Cu<sup>2+</sup> + 2 e<sup><U+2013></sup> <U+2192> Cu

===Recycling===
Copper, like aluminium, is 100% recyclable without any loss of quality whether in a raw state or contained in a manufactured product. In volume, copper is the third most recycled metal after iron and aluminium. It is estimated that 80% of the copper ever mined is still in use today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copperinfo.com/environment/recycling.html|title=International Copper Association}}</ref>

The process of recycling copper follows roughly the same steps as is used to extract copper, but requires fewer steps. High purity scrap copper is melted in a furnace and then [[redox|reduced]] and cast into [[semi-finished casting products#Billet|billet]]s and [[ingot]]s; lower purity scrap is refined by electroplating in a bath of sulfuric acid.<ref>[http://www.copper.org/publications/newsletters/innovations/1998/06/recycle_overview.html "Overview of Recycled Copper" ''Copper.org''.]</ref>

===Binary compounds===
As for other elements, the simplest compounds of copper are binary compounds, i.e. those containing only two elements.  The principal ones are the oxides, sulfides and [[halide]]s. Both [[copper(I) oxide|cuprous]] and [[copper(II) oxide|cupric oxides]] are known. Among the numerous [[copper sulfide]]s, important examples include [[copper(I) sulfide]] and [[copper monosulfide|copper(II) sulfide]].

The cuprous halides with [[copper(I) chloride|chlorine]], [[copper(I) bromide|bromine]], and [[copper(I) iodide|iodine]] are known, as are the cupric halides with [[copper(II) fluoride|fluorine]], [[copper(II) chloride|chlorine]], and [[copper(II) bromide|bromine]]. Attempts to prepare copper(II) iodide give cuprous iodide and iodine.<ref name="Holleman">{{cite book |last1=Holleman |first1=A.

===Coordination chemistry===
[[File:Tetramminkupfer(II)-sulfat-Monohydrat Kristalle.png|thumb|left|Copper(II) gives a deep blue coloration in the presence of ammonia ligands. The one used here is [[tetramminecopper(II) sulfate]].]]
Copper, like all metals, forms [[coordination complex]]es with [[ligand]]s. In aqueous solution, copper(II) exists as [Cu(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>. This complex exhibits the fastest water exchange rate (speed of water ligands attaching and detaching) for any transition [[metal aquo complex]].   Adding an aqueous [[sodium hydroxide]] causes the precipitation of light blue solid [[copper(II) hydroxide]]. A simplified equation is:
:Cu<sup>2+</sup> + 2 OH<sup><U+2212></sup> <U+2192> Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>
An [[ammonia solution|aqueous ammonia]] causes the same precipitate to form. Upon adding excess ammonia, the precipitate dissolves, forming [[Schweizer's reagent|tetraamminecopper(II)]]:
:Cu(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> + 4 NH<sub>3</sub> <U+2192> [Cu(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + 2 OH<sup><U+2212></sup>
Many other [[oxyanion]]s form complexes; these include [[copper(II) acetate]], [[copper(II) nitrate]], and [[copper(II) carbonate]]. [[Copper(II) sulfate]] forms a blue crystalline penta[[hydrate]], which is the most familiar copper compound in the laboratory. It is used in a [[fungicide]] called the [[Bordeaux mixture]].<ref name="Boux">{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=cItuoO9zSjkC&pg=PA623|page = 623|chapter = Nonsystematic (Contact) Fungicides|title = Ullmann's Agrochemicals|isbn = 9783527316045|author1 = Wiley-Vch,|date = 2007-04-02}}</ref>

[[Polyol]]s, compounds containing more than one alcohol [[functional group]], generally interact with cupric salts. For example, copper salts are used to test for [[reducing sugars]]. Specifically, using [[Benedict's reagent]] and [[Fehling's solution]] the presence of the sugar is signaled by a color change from blue Cu(II) to reddish copper(I) oxide.<ref>Ralph L.

===Bronze Age===
{{Main|Bronze Age}}
Alloying of copper with zinc or tin to make brass and bronze was practiced soon after the discovery of copper. Bronze artifacts from [[Sumer|Sumerian]] cities and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] artifacts of copper and bronze alloys date to 3000 BC.<ref name=hist>{{cite book|pages = 13;48<U+2013>66|title = Encyclopaedia of the History of Technology|author = McNeil, Ian |publisher = Routledge|year = 2002|location = London ; New York|isbn = 0203192117}}</ref> The [[Bronze Age]] was from 2500 BC to 600 BC when usage of bronze was widespread in Europe; the transition between the [[Neolithic]] period and the Bronze Age is termed the [[Chalcolithic]] period (copper-stone), with copper tools being used with stone tools. Brass was known to the Greeks, but became a significant supplement to bronze during the Roman Empire.<ref name=hist/>

===Antiquity and Middle Ages===
[[File:Venus symbol.svg|thumb|left|100px|In [[alchemy]] the symbol for copper, perhaps a stylized mirror, was also the symbol for the goddess and planet [[Venus]].]]
[[File:TimnaChalcolithicMine.JPG|thumb|Chalcolithic copper mine in [[Timna Valley]], [[Negev Desert]], Israel.]]

In Greece, copper was known by the name ''chalkos'' (<U+03C7><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03C2>). It was an important resource for the Romans, Greeks and other ancient peoples. In Roman times, it was known as ''aes Cyprium'', ''aes'' being the generic Latin term for copper alloys and ''Cyprium'' from [[Cyprus]], where much copper was mined. The phrase was simplified to ''cuprum'', hence the English ''copper''. [[Aphrodite]] and [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] represented copper in mythology and alchemy, due to its lustrous beauty, its ancient use in producing mirrors, and its association with Cyprus, which was sacred to the goddess. The seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients were associated with the seven metals known in antiquity, and Venus was assigned to copper.<ref>{{cite journal|title = The Nomenclature of Copper and its Alloys|author = Rickard, T.

Britain's first use of brass occurred around the 3rd<U+2013>2nd century BC. In North America, copper mining began with marginal workings by Native Americans. Native copper is known to have been extracted from sites on [[Isle Royale]] with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600.<ref>{{cite journal|title = The State of Our Knowledge About Ancient Copper Mining in Michigan|journal = The Michigan Archaeologist|volume = 41|pages = 119|author = Martin, Susan R. |year = 1995|url = http://www.ramtops.co.uk/copper.html|issue =2<U+2013>3}}</ref> Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD; it proceeded at a much slower rate on other continents. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production did not start until the early 20th century.

The cultural role of copper has been important, particularly in currency. Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money. At first, the copper itself was valued, but gradually the shape and look of the copper became more important. [[Julius Caesar]] had his own coins made from brass, while [[Augustus|Octavianus Augustus Caesar]]'s coins were made from Cu-Pb-Sn alloys. With an estimated annual output of around 15,000 t, [[Roman metallurgy|Roman copper mining and smelting activities]] reached a scale unsurpassed until the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]]; the [[Roman province|provinces]] most intensely mined were those of [[Hispania]], [[Cyprus]] and in Central Europe.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1126/science.272.5259.246|title = History of Ancient Copper Smelting Pollution During Roman and Medieval Times Recorded in Greenland Ice|pages = 246<U+2013>249 (247f.)|year = 1996|last1 = Hong|first1 = S.|last2 = Candelone|first2 = J.-P.|issue = 5259|last3 = Patterson|first3 = C.

===Modern period===
[[File:AngleseyCopperStream.jpg|right|thumb|160px|A copper saturated stream running from the disused [[Parys Mountain]] mines]]
The [[Great Copper Mountain]] was a mine in Falun, Sweden, that operated from the 10th century to 1992. It produced two thirds of Europe's copper demand in the 17th century and helped fund many of Sweden's wars during that time.<ref>{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=4yp-x3TzDnEC&pg=PA60|pages = 60|title = Mining in World History|isbn = 9781861891730|author1 = Lynch, Martin|date = 2004-04-15}}</ref> It was referred to as the nation's treasury; Sweden had a [[History of copper currency in Sweden|copper backed currency]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Gold: prices, facts, figures and research: A brief history of money|url=http://www.galmarley.com/FAQs_pages/monetary_history_faqs.htm#Scandinavian%20copper%20money|accessdate=22 April 2011}}</ref>

The uses of copper in art were not limited to currency: it was used by [[Renaissance]] sculptors, in pre-photographic technology known as the [[daguerreotype]], and the Statue of Liberty. [[Copper plating]] and [[copper sheathing]] for ships' hulls was widespread; the ships of Christopher Columbus were among the earliest to have this feature.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Copper History|url = http://www.copperinfo.com/aboutcopper/history.html|accessdate = 2008-09-04}}</ref> The [[Norddeutsche Affinerie]] in Hamburg was the first modern [[electroplating]] plant starting its production in 1876.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1002/adem.200400403|title = Process Optimization in Copper Electrorefining|year = 2004|author = Stelter, M.|journal = Advanced Engineering Materials|volume = 6|issue = 7|page=558|last2 = Bombach|first2 = H.}}</ref> The German scientist [[Gottfried Osann]] invented [[powder metallurgy]] in 1830 while determining the metal's atomic mass; around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element (e.g. tin) to copper would affect bell tones.

The [[Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries]], formed in 1967 with Chile, Peru, Zaire and Zambia, played a similar role for copper as [[OPEC]] does for oil. It never achieved the same influence, particularly because the second-largest producer, the United States, was never a member; it was dissolved in 1988.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Karen A.

==Applications==
[[File:Kupferfittings 4062.jpg|thumb|Assorted copper fittings]]
2% of copper supply is used for production of compounds; the main applications are nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture. The rest of it is used as the metal,<ref name="Boux"/> but is often too soft for use. Therefore, it is incorporated in alloys, examples being brass and bronze.<ref name="Applications for Copper">{{cite web|title = Copper|publisher = American Elements|year = 2008|url = http://www.americanelements.com/cu.html|accessdate = 2008-07-12}}</ref> [[Machining]] is possible, although it is usually necessary to use an alloy for intricate parts to get good machinability characteristics.

===Electronics and related devices===
[[File:Busbars.jpg|thumb|left|Copper electrical [[busbar]]s distributing power to a large building]]
Copper's electrical properties are exploited in [[copper wire]]s and devices such as [[electromagnet]]s. [[Integrated circuit]]s and [[printed circuit board]]s increasingly feature copper in place of aluminium because of its superior electrical conductivity; [[heat sink]]s and [[heat exchanger]]s use copper as a result of its superior heat dissipation capacity to aluminium. [[Vacuum tube]]s, [[cathode ray tube]]s, and the [[magnetron]]s in microwave ovens use copper, as do [[Waveguide|wave guide]]s for microwave radiation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Accelerator: Waveguides (SLAC VVC)|url=http://www2.slac.stanford.edu/vvc/accelerators/waveguide.html|work=SLAC Virtual Visitor Center|accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref>

===Architecture and industry===
[[File:Minneapolis City Hall.jpg|thumb|Copper roof on the [[Minneapolis City Hall]], coated with [[patina]]]]
[[File:Copper utensils Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Old copper utensils in a Jerusalem restaurant]]
Due to the waterproof nature of copper, it has been used as the [[Metal roof|roofing]] material of many buildings since ancient times. The green colour on these buildings is due to a long-term chemical reaction: copper is first oxidised to copper(II) oxide, then to cuprous and cupric sulfide and finally to copper(II) carbonate, also called verdigris, which is highly corrosion-resistant.<ref>{{cite web|last = Berg|first = Jan|title = Why did we paint the library's roof?|url = http://www.deforest.lib.wi.us/FAQS.htm|accessdate = 2007-09-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070625065039/http://www.deforest.lib.wi.us/FAQS.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-25}}</ref> The copper used in this application is phosphorus deoxidized copper (Cu-DHP).<ref>[[ASTM]] B 152, ''Standard Specification for Copper Sheet, Strip, Plate, and Rolled Bar.''</ref>

===Copper in alloys===
{{See also|List of copper alloys}}
Numerous [[copper alloys]] exist, many with important uses. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc; cupronickel is an alloy of copper and nickel. Bronze usually refers to copper-tin alloys but can refer to any alloy of copper such as [[aluminium bronze]]. Copper is one of the most important constituents of [[carat (purity)|carat]] silver and gold alloys and carat solders used in the jewelry industry, modifying the color, hardness and melting point of the resulting alloys.<ref name=goldalloys>{{cite web|url = http://www.utilisegold.com/jewellery_technology/colours/colour_alloys/|accessdate = 2009-06-06|title = Gold Jewellery Alloys|publisher = World Gold Council}}</ref>

===Antibiofouling applications===
Copper has long been used as a [[biostatic]] surface to line parts of ships to protect against [[barnacle]]s and [[mussel]]s. It was originally used pure, but has since been superseded by [[Muntz metal]]. Bacteria will not grow on a copper surface because it is biostatic. Similarly, as discussed in [[copper alloys in aquaculture]], copper alloys have become important netting materials in the [[aquaculture]] industry for the fact that they are [[antimicrobial]] and prevent [[biofouling]] even in extreme conditions<ref name="autogenerated1995">Edding, Mario E., Flores, Hector, and Miranda, Claudio, (1995), Experimental Usage of Copper-Nickel Alloy Mesh in Mariculture.

===Other uses===
Copper compounds in liquid form are used as a wood preservative, particularly in treating original portion of structures during restoration of damage due to [[dry rot]]. Together with zinc, copper wires may be placed over non-conductive roofing materials to discourage the growth of moss. Textile fibers use copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics,<ref>{{cite web|title = Antimicrobial Products that Shield Against Bacteria and Fungi|publisher = Cupron, Inc.|year = 2008|url = http://www.cupron.com/|accessdate = 2008-07-13}}</ref> as do [[ceramic glaze]]s, [[stained glass]] and [[musical instrument]]s. Electroplating commonly uses copper as a base for other metals such as nickel. Copper is also commonly found in jewellery and folklore states that copper bracelets relieve [[arthritis]] symptoms, though this is not proven.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=W. R.|last2=Keats|first2=D.

{{Main|Copper toxicity}}

Ingesting too much copper - for example from food cooked with copper cookware - can cause health problems. The reason is that free copper is a generator of [[reactive oxygen species]] that can damage [[DNA]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Yunbo|last2=Trush|first2=Michael|last3=Yager|first3=James|title=DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species originating from a copper-dependent oxidation of the 2-hydroxy catechol of estradiol|journal=Carcinogenesis|year=1994|volume=15|issue=7|pages=1421-1427|doi=10.1093/carcin/15.7.1421}}</ref> Specific examples of this include [[Wilson's disease]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]], with symptoms including [[vomiting]], [[jaundice]] and [[cirrhosis]], of which the last has been linked to boiling milk in copper cookware. The [[Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy]] states that a genetic defect is associated with this cirrhosis;<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec01/ch005/ch005c.html?qt=copper%20and%20milk&alt=sh|title = Merck Manuals <U+2013> Online Medical Library: Copper|publisher = Merck|date = November 2005|accessdate = 2008-07-19}}</ref> the toxicity can be treated with heavy metal chelating agents like [[dimercaprol]]. Since copper is actively excreted by the body, chronic copper toxicity in humans without the genetic defect in handling copper has not been demonstrated;<ref name="copper.org"/> gram quantities of copper salts taken in suicide attempts have produced acute copper toxicity in humans. Equivalent amounts of copper salts (30&nbsp;mg/kg) are toxic in animals.<ref>{{cite web|title = Pesticide Information Profile for Copper Sulfate|url = http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/carbaryl-dicrotophos/copper-sulfate-ext.html|publisher = Cornell University|accessdate=2008-07-10}}</ref>
