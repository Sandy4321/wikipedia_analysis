'''Lavaca Bay''' is a northwestern extension of the [[Matagorda Bay]] system found mostly in [[Calhoun County, Texas|Calhoun County]], Texas, United States. The ports of [[Port Lavaca, Texas|Port Lavaca]] and [[Point Comfort, Texas|Point Comfort]] have been established on the bay, and are the main areas of human habitation. [[Linnville, Calhoun County, Texas|Linnville]] was located on the bay until its abandonment after the [[Great Raid of 1840]], and the major port of [[Indianola, Texas|Indianola]] was found near the confluence with the main Matagorda Bay, until the town's final destruction following the massive [[1886 Indianola hurricane|hurricane of 1886]].<ref name="handbook"/> Smaller communities include [[Olivia, Texas|Olivia]], [[Alamo Beach, Texas|Alamo Beach]] and [[Magnolia Beach, Texas|Magnolia Beach]]. Lavaca Bay is approximately {{convert|82|mi|km|sigfig=2}} northeast of [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]], about {{convert|121|mi|km|sigfig=2}} southwest of [[Houston]], and {{convert|145|mi|km|sigfig=2}} southeast of [[San Antonio]].

The bay is noted for its [[superfund]] site, caused by mercury pollution from the heavy industry in Point Comfort (specifically [[Alcoa]]), across the bay from the largest settlement of Port Lavaca. Although fishing has declined in recent years due to fears of contamination, the bay supports a large finfish population, and the efforts of environmental organizations and the federal government have pressured Alcoa to reduce the polluted areas. 

==History==
Lavaca Bay was formed when the sea level rose following the last ice age, flooding the Lavaca River-Garcitas Creek basin.<ref name="huser">{{cite book|last=Huser|first=Verne|title=Rivers of Texas|date=2004-03|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|location=College Station, Texas|isbn=9781585443697|page=199}}</ref> The name comes from the Spanish adaptation of the French ''vache'' or cow, given to the area by French explorer [[Ren<U+00E9>-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] for the sightings of [[Plains Bison]], which were once common near the bay and the creeks that feed it. It is believed La Salle established his [[French colonization of Texas|Fort St. Louis colony]] near the bay on Garcitas Creek.<ref name="handbook">{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/LL/rrl3.html|title=Lavaca Bay|last=Leatherwood|first=Art|date=May 30, 2010|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=June 19, 2010}}</ref> The first sizable human settlement on the bay shore was at the town of New Port, established in 1831 by Irish merchant [[John J. Linn]] as part of [[De Le<U+00F3>n's colony]]. The site was later renamed Linnville, and grew to a population of 200 by 1839. It was described as "a place of considerable business" in ''Sketches of Texas in 1840'', and was used extensively during the early years of the [[Republic of Texas]]. Future [[Mayor of San Antonio|San Antonio Mayor]] [[Samuel Maverick]] owned a warehouse in the town, along with many other prominent Texans. The town was destroyed during the [[Great Raid of 1840]], orchestrated by the [[Comanche]] Indians, and was later abandoned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/LL/hvl58.html|title=Linnville, Texas|last=Roell|first=Craig H.|date=May 30, 2010|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref> 

[[Port Lavaca, Texas|Port Lavaca]] or Labaca, developed after the abandonment of Linnville. It grew substantially following the destruction of Indianola, and became a prominent shipping location and national leader in [[Shrimp fishery|shrimp production]].<ref name="Lavaca">{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/PP/hep7.html|title=Port Lavaca, Texas|last=Maywald|first=Lonnie Ficklen|date=March 31, 2010|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=June 19, 2010}}</ref> Across the bay and currently connected by [[Texas State Highway 35]], the town of [[Point Comfort, Texas|Point Comfort]] is found.

Lavaca Bay is the largest extension of the Matagorda Bay system, and includes its own extensions of Chocolate Bay to the southwest, Cox Bay to the east, and Keller Bay to the southeast. The [[Lavaca River]] as well as [[Garcitas Creek]] and [[Venado Creek]] supply the bay with freshwater from the north. Channels have been dredged to connect the bay to the [[Intracoastal Waterway]], which runs to the south.<ref name="handbook"/> On average, the bay is about {{convert|4|ft|m|0}} in depth.<ref name="untapped"/>

Unlike most of the Matagorda Bay system, Lavaca Bay has a mostly muddy bottom with large amounts of oyster reefs and spoils islands formed by the dredging of several canals. The shores are lined with grassy bluffs and a thick cover of trees.<ref name="untapped"/> The Lavaca River enters near the Port Lavaca Causeway as it traverses Lavaca Bay from Port Lavaca to Point Comfort at the center of the bay, which is also its narrowest width.<ref name="topo">{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/|title=Topographic Maps|work=Digital-Topo-Maps.com|publisher=Google|accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref> The river flows {{convert|115|mi|km|sigfig=2}} southeast from its source in northeast [[Gonzales County, Texas|Gonzales County]], draining approximately {{convert|2280|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} into Lavaca Bay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/LL/rnl2.html|title=Lavaca River|last=Carroll|first=Jeff|date=May 30, 2010|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref> South of the Port Lavaca Causeway in Point Comfort, on the bay's eastern shore, a heavy industrial sector is located, which lines the coast to Cox Bay, which extends to the east. South of Cox Bay is the larger Keller Bay extension, which extends the bay to its easternmost point near Olivia. Below the extension, is a narrow peninsula, bounded by Matagorda Bay to the south, which extends west to mouth of Lavaca Bay. Across the mouth on the western shore, past the Matagorda Ship Channel, which runs through the middle of the bay to Point Comfort, the town of Magnolia Beach is found. To the northwest is the town of Alamo Beach, located on Gailinipper Point, from which a major oyster reef begins across the bay to Point Comfort. The point is located on the northeastern extreme of a headland that juts to the north, forming Chocolate Bay to the west. Port Lavaca is found north of Chocolate Bay, back at the Port Lavaca Causeway. North of the causeway is a large circular extension, forming the northern boundary of the Lavaca Bay. The northwestern extreme is formed by Garcitas Cove,<ref name="topo"/> fed by Garcitas Creek, which flows {{convert|48|mi|km|sigfig=2}} from its source in [[DeWitt County, Texas|DeWitt County]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/GG/rbg9.html|title=Garcitas Creek|last=Roell|first=Craig H.|date=May 30, 2010|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref> To the east is Venado Creek, which converges with the bay, northwest of the mouth of the Lavaca River.<ref name="topo"/>

==Ecosystem==
[[File:Restoration of Lavaca Bay, Texas.jpg|thumb|Additional salt marsh added to the bay.]]
Lavaca Bay hosts a wide range of finfish including [[Black drum]], [[Flounder]], [[Redfish]], [[Sheepshead]] and [[Speckled trout]],<ref name="huser"/> however it suffers from [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] pollution. An [[Alcoa]] plant in Point Comfort dumped an estimated {{convert|67|lb|kg|sigfig=2}} of mercury into the bay per day in the 1960s, affecting {{convert|64|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}.<ref name="untapped"/> A mercury [[superfund]] was established at the site, and the processing of oysters and [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]] in certain locations was prohibited.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sansom|first1=Andrew|last2=Armitano|first2=Emily R.|last3=Wassenich|first3=Tom|title=Water in Texas: An Introduction|date=August 1, 2008|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, Texas|isbn=9780292718098|pages=128}}</ref> A study revealed that the bay's [[detritus]] is more than ten times as contaminated as nearby Keller Bay.<ref>{{cite book|last=Neff|first=Jerry M.|title=Bioaccumulation in Marine Organisms: Effect of Contaminants from Oil Well Produced Water|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier|location=San Diego, California|isbn=9780080437163|pages=118<U+2013>119}}</ref>  

The pollution issue is a main concern of citizens of Calhoun County, and has attracted demonstrations against industry in Point Comfort.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Diane|last2=Ausubel|first2=Kenny|title=An Unreasonable Woman: A True Story of Shrimpers, Politicos, Polluters, And the Fight for Seadrift, Texas|date=August 21, 2006|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=White River Junction, Vermont|isbn=9781933392271|pages=10}}</ref> However, Alcoa has worked with state and federal officials, spending $110&nbsp;million to reduce the size of the superfund site, as part of a 2005 settlement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/newsmedia/releases/?req=20070402b|title=Lavaca Bay Restoration Credited to Government-Industry Partnership|date=April 2, 2007|publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife|accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref> Cooperation aims to create 70 additional acres of salt marsh and 11 acres of oyster reef habitat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/topic_subtopic_entry.php?RECORD_KEY%28entry_subtopic_topic%29=entry_id,subtopic_id,topic_id&entry_id(entry_subtopic_topic)=396&subtopic_id(entry_subtopic_topic)=20&topic_id(entry_subtopic_topic)=4|title=Restoration in Lavaca Bay, Texas|date=October 13, 2006|work=Natural Resource Restoration|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=May 13, 2011}}</ref>

Locals have estimated that the only area still affected by contamination is just offshore from the Alcoa plant. Signs warning boaters of the water's toxicity are found at the site. The stigma attached to the bay due to reports of pollution has discouraged fishing, enabling a healthy population to develop.<ref name="untapped">{{cite web|url=http://gulffishing.com/092_Untapped_Lavaca.html|title=Untapped Lavaca Bay|last=Tomek|first=Kyle|work=Gulf Coast Fisherman|publisher=Harold Wells Gulf Coast Fisherman, Inc.|accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref>

==Industry==
[[File:Point comfort.jpg|thumb|Industry in Point Comfort]]
Industry is heavy along the bay, with an abundance of natural gas and oil wells at all corners. Natural gas was discovered at the site in 1934, and oil was discovered the next year. Point Comfort is home to several industrial plants along the shore, including Alcoa, [[Union Carbide]], [[Du Pont]], and [[Formosa]], which contribute to the local economies. Despite the restrictions on the bay that prevent the production of fish and shellfish along the superfund site, seafood harvesting is a major industry. However, it is not as prominent as it was in the 1920s, when Port Lavaca led the nation in shrimp production, leading to the construction of a quick-freezing plant.<ref name="Lavaca"/> Today, [[shrimping]] is only allowed south of the Port Lavaca Causeway, due to the north's classification as a nursery location.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/publications/annual/fish/shrimpreg/|title=Recreational Fishing: Shrimp Regulations|publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife Department|accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref> Shellfish production is allowed in Keller Bay and Lavaca Bay south of Point Comfort, but is restricted along the eastern and northern coast and Chocolate Bay, and is conditionally approved in the remaining locations, including along the shore of Port Lavaca.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/seafood/MapsPDF/ShellfishClassificationMaps/Lavaca809.pdf|title=Classification of Shellfish Harvesting Areas of Lavaca Bay|date=November 1, 2009|publisher=Texas Department of State Health Services Seafood and Aquatic Life Group|accessdate=August 2, 2010}}</ref> A small tourism industry also fuels economic growth, spurred by the Port Lavaca State Fishing Pier found alongside the Port Lavaca Causeway. The pier once served as the causeway across the bay but was replaced in the 1960s and converted into a fishing pier of {{convert|3200|ft|m|sigfig=2}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/PP/ggp2.html|title=Port Lavaca State Fishing Pier|last=Long|first=Christopher|date=May 30, 2010|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=August 2, 2010}}</ref> billed as the longest in the world.<ref name="untapped"/>
