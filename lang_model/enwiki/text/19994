The '''Toronto Transit Commission''' ('''TTC''') is a [[public transport]] authority that operates [[bus]]es, [[streetcars]], [[Subway (rail)|subway]]s, and [[rapid transit]] lines in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. The TTC operates 149 surface transit routes, of which 148 routes make 243 connections with a subway or rapid transit station during weekday rush hours. In 2006, the TTC carried 444,544,000 passengers, 3,229,000 passengers daily (2,033,000 revenue passengers). The TTC employed 10,930 personnel in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/pdf/operatingstatistics2006.pdf|title=TTC Operating Statistics|year=2006|publisher=TTC|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref>

==Overview==
The TTC operates the third most heavily-used urban mass transit system in [[North America]] (after [[New York City]]'s [[New York City Transit Authority]] and the [[Mexico City Metro]]).<ref name=TTCstats>{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1122072619227_40/?hub=CTVNewsAt11|title=Toronto transit chief says searches unlikely|date=2005-07-24|accessdate=2007-02-03|Publisher=[[CTV.ca]]|first=Robert|Last=Fife}}</ref> [[As of 2004]], there are three subway lines and one rapid transit line (see [[Toronto subway and RT]]) with a total of 69 stations, as well as 149 connecting "surface" routes (buses and streetcars).  The average daily ridership exceeds 2.46 million passengers: 1,197,000 through bus, 328,700 by streetcar, 35,300 by intermediate rail, and 901,400 by subway.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.apta.com/research/stats/ridership/riderep/documents/06q4can.pdf|title=APTA Transit Ridership Report|pages=33|publisher=American Public Transit Association|year=2006}}</ref>  The TTC also provides door-to-door services for persons with physical disabilities known as [[WheelTrans]].  An approximate 4,500 trips are made through this service daily.  Colloquially, the subway cars were known as "red rockets" (nickname originally given to Gloucester Subway cars painted bright red - now retired); hence the use of "Ride the Rocket" in advertising material for the TTC (which uses the phrase to advertise the entire system), and the use of the word "Rocket" in the names of some express buses. The entire system is also promoted as "The Better Way".

==History==
{{main|History of the Toronto Transit Commission}}
Privately operated transit services in Toronto began in 1849. In later years, a few routes were operated by the city, but it was 1921 when the city took over all routes and formed the '''[[Toronto Transportation Commission]]''' to operate them.  During this period service was mainly provided by streetcars. In 1954, the TTC adopted its present name, opened its first subway line, and greatly expanded its service area to cover the newly formed municipality of [[Metropolitan Toronto]] (which eventually became the [[megacity#Canadian usage of Megacity|enlarged city]] of Toronto). The system has evolved to feature a wide network of bus routes with the subway lines as the backbone.

===2007 budget crisis===
{{Current-section|date=July 2007}}
Toronto's City Council has decided that the city will not introduce new taxes worth an estimated [[CAD$]]356 million annually.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/article/237779|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|title=Cuts, fare hikes menace TTC|date=2007-07-19|accessdate=2007-07-21|first=Jim|last=Byers}}</ref> In order to address the city's budget shortfall, the municipal government has indicated that every civic department needs to cut their budgets. The TTC will have to reduce the 2007 budget by CAD$30 million, and remove CAD$100 million in 2008. TTC chair Adam Giambrone called an emergency meeting on [[July 19]], [[2007]] to discuss how to implement the cuts. Possible changes could include the closure of the Sheppard Subway by the beginning of 2008, and the elimination of 21 bus routes with the lowest riderships (including 26 Dupont and 67 Pharmacy). New bus purchases would have to be put off and service improvements mothballed.

==Transit modes==

The TTC currently operates an extensive network of [[Rapid transit|subways]], [[streetcar]]s, [[light rail]] vehicles, [[paratransit]] buses and standard [[bus]]es in Toronto:

===Subway/RT system (1954-present)===
[[Image:St George Toronto Subway.jpg|thumb|right|200px|St. George subway station, Yonge-University-Spadina platform.]]
{{main|Toronto subway and RT}}
The Toronto subway/RT system consists of the [[Yonge-University-Spadina (TTC)|Yonge-University-Spadina Line]], a U-shaped line started in 1954 and last extended in 1996; the [[Bloor-Danforth (TTC)|Bloor-Danforth Line]], an east-west line started in 1966 and last extended in 1980; the [[Scarborough RT (TTC)|Scarborough RT]], a partly elevated [[light rail]] line built in [[1985]] which continues from the Bloor-Danforth Line's eastern terminus; and the [[Sheppard (TTC)|Sheppard Line]], opened in 2002. The three subway lines use the same technology, while the Scarborough RT has many differences.

Plans were made for a streetcar subway along Queen Street, which were upgraded to a full subway in 1964, from the Humber loop to Greenwood, curving north to connect to the Bloor-Danforth Subway. All that ever materialized of this line was an incomplete east-west station structure under Queen station at Yonge, which remains in existence today. The Queen Subway plan was cancelled in 1974 in favour of new lines in [[North York, Ontario|North York]].

In the mid-1990s, work began on an [[Eglinton West subway]] line, but the project was cancelled before significant progress was made. Construction of this line is no longer a priority for the TTC, but this line was recently re-visited in the proposed expansion as part underground LRT running in the central part of the line (between Keele and Laird Rd.) with the remainder a  surface LRT route which would span almost the entire length of the city from the Airport to Scarborough. 

A current focus for the TTC's rapid-transit expansion is a short extension bringing the western branch of the Yonge-University-Spadina Line north-west to [[York University]], [[Steeles Avenue]] and [[Vaughan Corporate Centre]] in [[Regional Municipality of York, Ontario|York Region]]. The Government of Ontario announced on March 23, 2006, that it will provide $670 million for this extension, about one-third of the expected cost. Another is the eastward extension of the Sheppard Line into [[Scarborough, Ontario|Scarborough]]. Recently, there has also been debate over the fate of the [[Scarborough RT]]. A solution is a near top priority as the line is currently overcrowded, and will soon require much investment to keep it running past 2015.

In September [[2006]], [[Toronto City Council]] approved a contract for 234 cars from [[Bombardier Transportation]]. There are also plans for the Yonge subway to be operated on a 24-hour basis.

===Streetcars (1861-present)===
[[Image:Ttc-streetcar.jpg|thumb|200px|A TTC streetcar on Dundas Street.]]
{{main|Toronto streetcar system}}
Toronto's streetcar system is one of the few in North America still operating along classic lines and has been operating since the mid-19th century with ([[horsecar]] service starting in 1861 and electric since 1892). Streetcar service dates back to the [[Toronto Street Railways]] horse-drawn cars and continues today with the current electric cars. New TTC routes since the 1940s have generally been operated by other modes, and the less-busy streetcar routes have also been converted. Streetcar routes are now focused on the downtown area, with none running farther north than [[St. Clair Avenue]], about 5 [[kilometre|km]] from [[Lake Ontario]]. A massive expansion of the streetcar network (as "Light Rapid Transit" on private rights-of-way) was proposed by the City of Toronto and the TTC on March 16, 2007, in the [[Transit City]] report.

===Buses (1921-present) and trolley coaches (1922-1925, 1947-1993)===
[[Image:DSC01311.JPG|thumb|Orion Bus Industries Orion VII]]
{{main|Toronto buses and trolley buses}}
Buses are a large part of TTC operations today, but before about 1960, they played a minor role compared to streetcars. Buses began to operate in the city in [[1921]] and became necessary for areas without streetcar service. After an earlier experiment in the [[1920]]s, [[trolley bus]]es were used on a number of routes starting in 1947, but all trolley bus routes were converted to bus operation between 1991 and 1993. The TTC always used the term trolley coach to refer to its trackless electric vehicles.

====Gray Coach (1927-1990)====
{{main|Gray Coach}}
Gray Coach Lines was a suburban and regional inter-city bus operator founded in 1927 by the TTC. Gray Coach used inter-urban coaches to link Toronto to points throughout Southern Ontario. In addition, Gray Coach operated tour buses in association with [[Gray Line Worldwide|Gray Line Tours]]. The main terminal was the [[Toronto Bus Terminal|Metropolitan Toronto Bus Terminal]] on Elizabeth Street, downtown. In 1954, Gray Coach expanded further when it acquired suburban routes from independent bus operators not merged with the TTC as it expanded to cover Metro Toronto. By the 1980s, Gray Coach faced fierce competition in the inter-urban service in the GTA. The TTC sold Gray Coach Lines in 1990.

===Wheelchair-accessible services (1975-present)===
[[Image:WheelTransBus.jpg|thumb|200px|A Wheel-Trans [[Overland ELF]] 9777  on a scheduled stop at Dufferin Mall in Toronto, Ontario.]]
{{main|Wheel-Trans|TTC accessibility}}

The TTC also runs [[Wheel-Trans]], a para-transit service for the physically disabled with special low-floor buses designed to accommodate wheelchairs and to make boarding easier for ambulatory customers with limited mobility. Since the 1990s, the TTC has focused in providing accessible services on conventional bus routes, the RT and subway.

===Ferry service (1927-1962)===
{{main|Toronto Island Ferry Services}}
The ferry service to the [[Toronto Islands]] was operated by the TTC from 1927 until 1962, when it was transferred to the Metro Parks and Culture department. Since 1998, the ferry service is run by [[Toronto Parks and Recreation]].

The city is studying plans to re-introduce ferry service by the TTC. The plan would see ferry service from Etobicoke and Scarborough into the downtown. Terminals would be located near the current city ferry docks, at Scarborough's Bluffer's Park and at Humber Bay Park. Two ferries would be required on the routes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/article/232632|title=TTC looks at speedy ferries|first=Jen|last=Gerson|accessdate=2007-07-21|date=2007-07-05|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]}}</ref>

==Operations and other information==
Most TTC operations are based either at the William McBrien building (TTC headquarters and MDP Office) at 1900 Yonge Street (over Davisville subway station), or at the Hillcrest complex (TTC's Transit Control office) located at Bathurst and Davenport Streets.

===Connections===

The TTC makes connections with other transit agencies at terminals in [[Toronto]]:

* [[York Region Transit]], including [[Viva (bus rapid transit)]]
* [[Mississauga Transit]]
* [[Brampton Transit]]
* [[Durham Region Transit]]
* [[GO Transit]]
* [[VIA Rail]], including [[Amtrak]]
* [[Greyhound Canada]]

===Terminals===
Most TTC surface routes terminate at loops, side streets or subway station complexes. The TTC system is one of the few mass transit systems in Canada where many surface routes can be accessed inside a paid-fare zone common to other routes or subway lines. This feature allows boarding via the back doors at terminals, reduces the usage of paper transfers, and the need of operators to check for proof-of-payment. However, many bus and streetcar terminals can be easily (illegally) accessed via the street, permitting fare evasion.  If the [[TTC Special Constable Services]] or [[Toronto Police]] officers caught the offenders, they are likely to face a $500.00 fine.

There are some larger loops at terminal buildings other than subway stations:

* Humber Loop
* Neville Park Loop
* Long Branch Loop (adjacent to [[Long Branch GO Station]])
* [[Rouge Hill (GO Station)]]

===Fares===
{{main|Toronto Transit Commission fares}}
The TTC fare system accepts cash, tickets, tokens, and transit passes. Current adult fares are $2.75 for a single trip, or $2.10 each for five trips using tickets or tokens. Passes are available by the day, week, or month, with a 12-month subscription option. Transfers are free (for trips in one direction), and this has has encouraged a grid system in changing routes is made easy for the passenger.

The provincial Minister of Transportation has announced plans to introduce the [[Presto card]], a unified [[smartcard]]-based payment system for the entire [[Greater Toronto Area]] similar to the [[Octopus Card]] used in [[Hong Kong]]. Union station will be first station to use the card in [[2007]] and four other stations (Don Mills, Downsview, Finch and Islington) by [[2010]].

===Schedules and information===
Before the use of the TTC website, TTC patrons were able to obtain route information from various sources: 
* Paper schedules and system maps from drivers and collector booths
* Fax number to obtain schedules and maps
* TimeLine: Most stops had a phone number to obtain the schedule for the select route. This system was removed in 1998 due to [[Year 2000 problem|Year 2000]] constraints. Route information is now accessed by InfoPost, TTC Info number 416-393-INFO or online at [http://www.ttc.ca www.ttc.ca] (this replaced the old numbers 481-4252 and 481-4544 in the 1980s). Some stops now display a time schedule for the particular route. 

* "What's On" and "Rocket Rider/TTC Customer News" pamphlets located on most vehicles

Transit Information Centres: 
* TTC Head Office - Davisville Station 1900 Yonge St.
* TTC Info Centre Bloor-Yonge Station - closed
* Metro Toronto Convention Centre - closed

Additional TTC information is circulated by:
* ''What's ON''
* polecards posted as bus and streetcar stops, as well as subway collector booth windows

===Shelters===
The shelters used by the systems are split between [[CBS Outdoor]] (formerly [[Viacom]] Media) (with ads) and [[Toronto Transportation]]. A total of 4,100 shelters are managed by Toronto Transportation and most from the former transportation departments of the municipalities that make up the [[City of Toronto]].

===Advertising===
Advertising is commonplace and prominent in all TTC vehicles and locations. In fact, some subway stops are periodically entirely "repainted" on the inside using large plastic decals, to the wishes of a paying corporate advertiser; this is also done with individual buses and all cars in a particular subway train. In 2005, the TTC began installing video screens in subway stations to display advertising, news, weather, and safety information.  This project is run by Toronto based [[ONESTOP Media Group]]. The agency contracted to post ads on the TTC is [[CBS Outdoor]]. However, the amount of money the TTC receives for allowing advertising on its property is very small. For the year ending 2003, the TTC received 2.3% of its revenue from advertising, or almost $17 million.

The TTC sells a line of merchandise through Legacy Sportswear, which is available online or at their store "TTC Transit Stuff" at the Union subway station. When Matt Blackett, publisher of ''[[Spacing Magazine]]'', approached the TTC in 2005 with an idea to sell buttons, each of which represented the colour scheme and design of a particular subway station, the TTC declined.  Blackett went on to manufacture the buttons himself.  Dubbed "the civic pride fashion statement of the year" by the ''[[National Post]]'', the buttons were a success, selling tens of thousands.

===Communications===
The TTC utilizes several types of voice and data communications.  There are three main systems.  The first is the system used by Operations, Security and Maintenance.  This system operates on five [[UHF]] conventional frequencies.  Channels 1, 3, 4 and 5 are used for day to day operations, while Channel 2 is reserved for the [[Wheel-Trans]] service.

Buses and streetcars use the CIS (Communications and Information System) system.  This system is spread out city wide with transmit facilities throughout the city.  Each bus and streetcar has a TRUMP set onboard.  This is attached to a transponder receiver which allows CIS operators to track the location of the vehicle using [[Signposts]].  The TRUMP also allows the operators and CIS operators to send and receive text messages for such things as short turns and route adjustments.  There is also the option of voice communications between the operator and the CIS operator.  There is also a built in emergency option, whereby a vehicle operator presses a red alarm.  This instantly notifies the CIS operator and enables a "hot mic", which allows the CIS operator to monitor all the activity on the bus.  The CIS system was conceived in the late 1970s and was fully implemented in 1991.  

The third system is used by the subway system.  This is called the Wayside system.  Replacing the old devices which communicated by the third rail are new UHF MPT-1327 [[Trunking]] radio sets.  The Subway system is divided into 3 separate systems, each representing it's respective subway line.  This new trunking system allows Transit Control to communicate directly with a single train, a zone encompassing several trains, or the entire line.  The Scarborough RT is not included in this system.  They continue to use a single channel UHF system, much the same as the system used by operations staff.

All of these systems can be monitored by a [[scanner]] capable of the UHF Low band (406-430MHz).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/spare/0018.shtml|publisher=Transit Toronto|title=TTC radio - some background information|first=John|last=Lennox|date=2006-11-10|accessdate=2007-07-21|}}</ref>  Numeric codes are also announced through the radio and/or the overhead paging system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5007.shtml|title=Subway/RT P.A. Code Numbers|accessdate=2007-07-21|date=2006-11-10|publisher=Transit Toronto}}</ref>

===Safety systems===
Safety features provided by the TTC include:
* Request Stop Program on surface routes (9 p.m.-5 a.m.) (excluding streetcar routes); female passengers travelling alone can request the driver to stop at points between bus stops (no such service is currently offered for male passengers).  The program was started in 1991, due largely in part to the activities of serial killer [[Paul Bernardo]] (also known as "the Scarborough Rapist").
* Designated Waiting Areas (DWA) on subway and RT platforms; these are well lit, have intercoms, and are at the location where the guard car stops 
* Yellow Passenger Assistance Alarm strips on subway and RT cars since the early 1980s  
* Approximately 800 cameras monitoring activities on the subway system and several cameras on some buses.
* TTC Special Constables
* Underground Alert messages displayed on the subway platform video screens to notify passengers about criminals.

===Auctions===
Each year the TTC auctions off items left on vehicles and not claimed. They are sold in lots, rather than individually. In 2005, the TTC launched an online auction via [[EBay|ebay Canada]] and Rite Auction Services.

===Underground Alert system===
On [[June 12]] [[2007]], the TTC in partnership with the Toronto Crime Stoppers and [[ONESTOP Media Group]] have launched a new Underground Alert system at the [[Toronto Police]] Headquarters.  The new '''Underground Alert''' system will post pictures and details of wanted suspects on the screens in stations throughout the subway system. Subway passengers will be enouraged to call police if they have any information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.222tips.com/index.php?pt=news&sec=4&sub=1076|title=Toronto Crime Stoppers Launches 'UNDERGROUND ALERT'|date=2007-06-12|publisher=Toronto Crime Stoppers|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/1800222tips|title=Toronto Crime Stoppers|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=2007-01-29|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_11933.aspx|publisher=CityNews.ca|title=Wanted Criminals To Show Up On Subway Monitors|accessdate=2007-07-21|date=2007-06-12}}</ref>

===Amber Alert system===
In addition to the new Underground Alert system, the TTC already airs the [[Amber Alert]] messages on approximately 100 subway platform video screens at over 60 subway stations along with Amber Alert messages heard on the public address systems in subway trains and subway platforms and displayed on TTC buses. When an Amber Alert is activated, all TTC operators are notified by their C.B. radio, and make an announcement that an Amber Alert has been activated, and put up the Amber Alert signs on TTC buses.  New subway trains coming out in 2009 will have Amber Alert messages displayed on the ticker and on the public address systems.

==Personnel==
Most of the Toronto Transit Commission's staff are members of the [[Amalgamated Transit Union]] Local 113. Total membership (2005) is approximately 8,000 members.

Unionized transit workers in Toronto began with: 
* Amalgamated Association of Street Railway Employees of America in 1892  
* Division 30 of the Amalgamated Association of Street and Railway Employees of America in 1893 
* Division 113 Chartered - Amalgamated Association of Street Railway Employees of America in 1899 
* Amalgamated Association of Street and Railway Employees of America in 1903 
* Amalgamated Transit Union in 1964 
* Local 113 of the Amalgamated Association of Street, Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees of America in 1952

Other than drivers and supervisors, the TTC also employs support staff to keep the system running: 
* cleaners to keep stations, bus shelters and other TTC property clean 
* garbage staff to pick up trash on vehicles and in stations
* clearing TTC roadways during winter months 
* engineers and support staff inspecting subway systems 
* mechanics that maintain all the commission vehicles 
* blacksmiths to make special parts of the TTC

===Memorial===

TTC employees who have lost their lives in the line of duty:

* Jimmy Trajceski - murder 1995
* Tony Almeida - accident 2007

===TTC strikes===
TTC strikes have affected TTC service on various occasions: [http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/history.htm]

* 1952: Strike shuts down TTC service for 19 days
* 1970: Strike, 12 days
* 1974: Strike, 23 days
* 1978: Strike, 8 days
* 1989: Labour disruption, 41 days.  [While technically not a strike, service was significantly disrupted during this period.]
* 1991: Strike, 8 days
* [[19 April]] [[1999]]: Strike closed TTC service for two days, ending when a labour agreement was reached. [http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/coupler/1199/review.htm]
* [[May 29]], [[2006]]: The TTC was shut down for one day as a result of a [[2006 TTC wildcat strike|labour dispute]]. Unionized workers began picketing TTC sites on the morning of [[May 29]] in response to a dispute over shift changes for unionized TTC employees due to the unionized workers feeling that management had broken the Collective Agreement between the management and the union. The TTC shut down transit services. The TTC called it an illegal strike, but the union said it was a lockout. The Ontario Labour Relations Board declared it an illegal strike and ordered employees back to work. The union agreed to have its employees return to work and services began to resume at 3 p.m. on [[May 29]], [[2006]]. It was later made public that only the support staff had walked out; TTC management had requested that the drivers and collectors not cross the picket lines to avoid disputes.

===Uniforms===
Most TTC staff wear uniforms consisting of a light blue shirt with TTC crest (long and short sleeves) and grey slacks. Other garments include maroon jackets with grey accents (an attempt to introduce blue jackets in place of the familiar maroon ones in the 1990s failed), dark navy sweater vests, and golf-style shirts, and grey shorts are worn according to weather. Hats are generally worn by senior staff, namely supervisors, these hats are familiar to those worn by police officers or salvation army members. Staff tend to wear [[tuque|toques]] during the winter months. Some vehicle operators wear a blue baseball cap with white lettering "TTC". Some of the maintenance staff wear dark blue or green coveralls with TTC crest along with an orange fluorescent jacket with a large yellow X with  the "TTC" lettering on the back. 
  
Prior to the current design, the uniform consisted of a light brown shirt and medium brown slacks and blazers.

===Honour Guard===
The TTC Honour Guard represents the TTC at city ceremonies and police funerals. Members wear caps, white shirts, blue blazers with Honour Guard crests and grey pants. The unit was formed in 1994 from TTC Operations supervisory ranks following the funeral for Toronto Police Constable Todd Baylis. The unit had 19 members as of 2001.

===Special Constables===
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:TTC Security Badge.JPG|100px]] -->
A contingent of over 88 Special Constables patrol TTC properties. They have the same powers as the [[Toronto Police Service]] to enforce:

*[[Canadian Criminal Code|Criminal Code]]
*[[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]]
*[[Immigration and Refugee Protection Act]]
*[[Trespass to Property Act of Ontario]]
*[[Liquor Licence Act (Ontario)|Liquor Licence Act]]
*Child and Family Services Act of Ontario
*Section 17 of the [[Mental Health Act of Ontario]].
 
In addition, they can also issue fines to persons in violation of [[TTC By-Law 1]]. 

Constables have three designations: 

*Subway Patrol 
*Mobile Patrol
*Criminal Investigations.
 
Subway Patrol members are visible in the subway system: they mostly patrol on foot, while the Mobile Patrol members are visible on TTC vehicles and TTC property.
