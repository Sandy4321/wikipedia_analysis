==Gameplay==

''Mario Power Tennis'' features variations of tennis games consisting of characters, courts, and scenarios based on the [[Mario series]]. The range of courts include the standard three [[Tennis courts#types of tennis courts|types of tennis court]], but consist predominantly of those themed upon games in the ''Mario'' series, known as "Gimmick" courts. As well as adopting the style aesthetically, these feature thematic elements that influence how the match will be played on that surface, such as the ghosts in the ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' court, which hinder movement when the character comes into physical contact with them.<ref name="Gamespot review"/> Although standard tennis is available in the game, variants of the game can be played which adopt different rules and methods of victory. "Ring Shot" involves the player earning points by hitting the ball through rings of varying sizes, with the number of points dependent on the difficulty of the shot.<ref>''Mario Power Tennis'' Instruction Booklet, pg.21</ref> The player acquires the points whenever a winning shot is made adhering to standard rules; the match is won once the predetermined number of points is equalled or surpassed. A similar mode, "Item Battle", involves the characters using items based on the ''Mario'' universe to interfere with each other's game and gain an advantage.<ref>''Mario Power Tennis'' Instruction Booklet, pg.20</ref>

The central mode of the game is "Tournament mode", which comprises a set of events with accumulating difficulty. These must be finished successfully to unlock playable characters. This can be completed either in "doubles" or "singles", and is divided into "Gimmick" courts and standard courts.<ref name="Eurogamer review"/> An alternative to these are "Special Games", which involves the player trying to meet a tennis-related objective on a "Gimmick" court. These come in multiple forms, incorporating themes from past Nintendo games, such as "Tic-Tac-Glow", which requires the player to hit balls of water to liberate [[Super Mario Sunshine#Shine sprites|shine sprites]] trapped in dirt,<ref>''Mario Power Tennis'' Instruction Booklet, pg.23</ref> a reference to ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. ''Power Tennis'' supports four-player multiplayer, which can be accessed during "Exhibition mode",<ref name="Eurogamer review"/> the standard mode of play where the player can choose his or her opponents and the conditions of the match. Such options include the difficulty of the opponent, the court used, and the number of games and sets required to win the match.

''Power Tennis'' features [[Mario Tennis (series)#Playable characters|18 playable characters]], all of whom derive from the ''Mario'' franchise. Many characters, such as [[Wario]], had already appeared in the game's predecessor and several other ''Mario'' [[spin-offs]], while this was the first appearance for [[Wiggler]] as a playable characters. All of the characters are categorised into six groups that reflect their playing style: all-around, technical, power, speed, defensive, and tricky.<ref>''Mario Power Tennis'' Instruction Booklet, pg.29-33</ref> Inherent in each character is also a set of two unique moves known as "power shots", with one being offensive and the other defensive.<ref name="Gamespot review"/> These powerful moves, which are accompanied with an animation each time they are triggered, incorporate the character's specific qualities. They can only be triggered occasionally in the match, but will usually result in defending or scoring a point, depending on the type of shot chosen. Generic tennis moves, such as slices, dropshots and lobs can be applied any time in the match.<ref name="Gamespot review"/>

==Development==
''Power Tennis'' was developed by [[Camelot Software Planning]], with a team consisting of approximately 30 people, headed by Hiroyuki and Shugo Takahashi.<ref name="IGN interview">{{cite web|url=http://uk.cube.ign.com/articles/570/570491p1.html|title=Camelot talks Mario Power Tennis|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2004-12-02|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref> The game was first unveiled in a 2002 issue of the Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'',<ref name=Unveiled>{{cite web|url=http://uk.cube.ign.com/articles/355/355026p1.html|title=Mario Tennis and golf announced|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2002-03-06|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref> and was later presented at the [[E3]] conference of 2004. Before release, the brothers discussed multiple developmental processes in an interview with ''Famitsu''. Apparently, Camelot had been working on a previous GameCube version of ''Mario Tennis'', but discontinued the project and began again using ideas and technology used for ''[[Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour]]'', which was being developed simultaneously with the game.<ref name="IGN interview">{{cite web|url=http://uk.cube.ign.com/articles/570/570491p1.html|title=Camelot talks Mario Power Tennis|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2004-12-02|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref> Shugo Takahasi noted that the original would have been more serious and contained deeper gameplay, but with fewer "Mario-esque" gimmicks. Also accounting for the delay of release was a willingness to not update the graphics only, which Hiroyuki stated would be "unacceptable for a Mario game". Due to the success of its predecessor, the brothers felt pressure to make a game that was original, and would not appear too similar to its predecessor on first sight.<ref name=Interview>{{cite web|url=http://uk.cube.ign.com/articles/533/533525p1.html|title=Mario Power Tennis info|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2004-07-26|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref> Nintendo released a questionnaire regarding players' habits and preferences in relation to tennis as a part of their ''Who Are You?'' campaign.<ref name=quiz>{{cite web|url=http://uk.cube.ign.com/articles/561/561049p1.html|title=Mario Power Tennis quiz|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2004-10-27|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref>

Following release, IGN interviewed Hiroyuki Takahasi regarding the development of the game. Takahasi revealed that Camelot had received co-operation from Nintendo in relation to voice acting and animation, which Takahashi stated as "contributing quite a bit to the improvement of the game's graphics". Takahashi proceeded to explain why the [[Role-playing game]] elements that were present in ''[[Mario Tennis (handheld game)|Mario Tennis]]'' were excluded from ''Power Tennis'', stating that he felt they were more suitable for the "deep single-player experience" present in portable consoles. Regarding the themed courts in the game, he explained that the concepts were conceived during long brainstorming sessions, with courts selected that would both remind gamers of older ''Mario'' games and introduce new gamers to ''Mario'' games they may not have played. When questioned about difficulties noting the game, Takahashi noted the effort used in making the opening sequences, developing the special games, and animations, which caused problems with meeting the schedule. Although there was speculation about online capabilities before release,<ref name="Online?">{{cite web|url=http://uk.cube.ign.com/articles/526/526108p1.html|title=Mario Tennis connected|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2004-07-24|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref> Takahashi refrained from making the game online-compatible due to fear of [[lagging]] problems, stating  "I don't think you can play a tennis game online under the current Internet environment and feel satisfied".<ref name="IGN interview">{{cite web|url=http://uk.cube.ign.com/articles/570/570491p1.html|title=Camelot talks Mario Power Tennis|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2004-12-02|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref>

The gameplay features introduced to the game received a mixed response. IGN noted that the "Special Games" varied in quality between different games, with Casamassina commenting that "they certainly don't make or break the experience."<ref name="IGN review"/> The game's "Powers Shots" was also met with an ambivalent reaction&mdash;the shot themselves were praised for adding strategy and character, although GameSpot's Ryan Davis commenting that "it would have been nice if you could just skip past the animations and keep the wild moves".<ref name="Gamespot review"/> In general, the game's multiplayer was more popular than single-player, with the "predictable and basic" [[artificial intelligence]] contributing to a low difficulty level at times.<ref name="Eurogamer review"/> GameSpy noted how the number of options and variables enhanced the multiplayer experience, and commented that "The game is very good on its own, but it excels when you bring friends into the mix."<ref name="GameSpy review"/> The mechanics of the tennis gameplay was also popular, with reviewers lauding the game's accessibility as well as its depth relating to the variety of shots available and how the position of the character affects the contact with the ball.<ref name="IGN review"/><ref name="Gamespot review"/>
