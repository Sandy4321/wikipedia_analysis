'''Bernard Fanning''' (Bernard Joseph Fanning, born 15 August 1969 in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]) is a [[musician]] and [[singer-songwriter]]. He is best known as the [[vocalist|lead singer]] and frontman of Australian [[alternative rock]] [[rock band|band]] [[Powderfinger]] since 1989.

Born and raised in [[Toowong, Queensland|Toowong]], Brisbane, Fanning was taught the piano by his mother at an early age. At the age of 15, while attending [[St. Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace]], Fanning began writing music, and upon graduating from St. Joseph's, moved on to the [[University of Queensland]], where he studied journalism for a short time. He would go on to drop out to pursue a music career, after meeting [[Ian Haug]] in an economics class. Fanning joined Haug, [[John Collins (musician)|John Collins]], and [[Steven Bishop]], who had recently formed Powderfinger, and took the role of lead singer. After Bishop left and guitarist [[Darren Milton]] joined, the band would release five [[studio album]]s in fifteen years and achieve mainstream success in Australia. During Powderfinger's hiatus in 2005, Fanning began his solo music career with the studio album ''[[Tea & Sympathy]]''. Powderfinger then reunited in 2007 and released two more albums before disbanning the group in late 2010.

While Powderfinger's style focuses on alternative rock, Fanning's solo music is generally described as a mixture of [[blues]] and [[acoustic folk]]. A multi-instrumentalist, Fanning plays guitar, piano, keyboards and harmonica, both when performing solo and also with Powderfinger. Often speaking out against Australian [[Politics in Australia|political figures]], Fanning has donated much of his time to philanthropic causes. He is an advocate for Aboriginal affairs in Australia.

== Early life ==
Fanning was born in [[Brisbane]] on 15 August 1969. He was raised, alongside two brothers and a sister, in the inner Brisbane suburb of [[Toowong, Queensland|Toowong]].<ref name=WhiteWithOne>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/10/20/1129775894691.html?page=2|title=White with one|publisher=''[[The Age]]''|author=Murfett, Andrew|date=October 22, 2005|accessdate=2008-02-18}}</ref> The death of one of Fanning's brothers to [[cancer]] would be the inspiration for ''[[Vulture Street]]'''s "[[Since You've Been Gone (Powderfinger song)|Since You've Been Gone]]".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/10/1057783275797.html|title=Powderfinger, Vulture Street|date=6 November 2003|publisher=''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''|accessdate=2008-02-18|author=Zuel, Bernard}}</ref> Fanning's mother began teaching him to play piano as a young child, although his siblings were not interested in music.<ref name=rolling>{{cite news|title=Powderfinger - Band of the Year|date=April 2001|author=Apter, Jeff|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''}}</ref>

Fanning attended [[St. Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace]] and began writing his own music at the age of 15. Fanning has described these early works as "terrible",<ref name=WhiteWithOne /> but notes that he enjoyed writing and arranging them.<ref name=WhiteWithOne /> After graduating from St Joseph's, Fanning entered the [[University of Queensland]] to study [[journalism]], however he was equally interested in pursuing a music career. He left university at the age of 19 to pursue a music career.<ref>{{cite news|title=At Home With Momentum Bernard Fanning|author=Holmes, Peter|publisher=''[[The Sun-Herald]]''|date=4 July 1999}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl19.htm --></ref>

== Music career ==
=== Powderfinger era (1989&ndash;2004) ===
{{seealso|Powderfinger#History}}
Fanning first met Powderfinger [[guitarist]] [[Ian Haug]] in a University of Queensland economics class in 1989.<ref name=WhiteWithOne /> At the time of the meeting, Haug had recently formed Powderfinger with high school friends [[John Collins (musician)|John Collins]] and [[Steven Bishop]], who would become the band's foundational [[bass guitarist]] and [[drummer]], respectively. Haug was the lead guitarist and [[lead singer]]. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman.<ref name=HSBios>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/bios/bios.htm#Bernard%20Fanning |title=Bernard Fanning|publisher=Hindley Site|work=Biographies|accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref><ref name="h2g2">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A695531|title=Powderfinger - The Band|accessdate=2007-12-31|date=February 13, 2002|publisher=[[h2g2]]}}</ref> Haug stated that "It was a big thing to convince the others that we needed a singer. They were like, 'You're OK,' and I was like, 'No I'm not. We can do better than that.'"<ref>{{cite news|title=Out Of The Blue|author=Wooldridge, Simon|publisher=''JUICE''|date=March 1997}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/article5.htm --></ref>

In 1992, current guitarist [[Darren Middleton]] was invited to join Powderfinger by Fanning and Haug, after they were impressed by his work in Brisbane band Pirate.<ref name="rockd">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist,6959.sm;jsessionid=EAFDD28E94BFB39BE30184BC24855E3D.rd1 |title=Powderfinger biography|accessdate=2007-12-31|date=September 25, 2006|publisher=RockDetector|author=Sharpe-Young, Gary}}</ref> Middleton accepted the offer and became the fifth member, joining [[Jon Coghill]] who had replaced Bishop as drummer. The lineup of Fanning, Middleton, Haug, Collins, and Coghill has since remained unchanged.<ref name=h2g2 /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/bios/bios.htm#Darren%20Middleton |title=Darren Middleton|publisher=Hindley Site|work=Biographies|accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref>

Throughout the late 1990s, Powderfinger rose to prominence throughout Australia, receiving several accolades and achieving highly successful record and concert ticket sales. As the most vocal and prominent member of the band, the popularity for the group elevated Fanning as a powerful individual in the public view of the Australian music industry.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Odyssey Files|author=Hunter, Chelsea|publisher=''X-Press Magazine''|date=October 2000}}</ref> Fanning was called upon by film-maker [[Gregor Jordan]] in 2003 to perform the folk song "Moreton Bay" (named after the [[Moreton Bay|bay of the same name]] in the Brisbane area) and his own original composition "Shelter for My Soul" in Jordan's film ''[[Ned Kelly (2003 film)|Ned Kelly]]''. Fanning then enlisted Jordan to film Powderfinger's first live DVD, ''[[These Days: Live in Concert]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Primed for P2K Tour |author=Pascuzzi, Carmine|year=1999}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl22.htm --></ref>

=== Solo venture (2004&ndash;2006) ===
{{seealso|Tea & Sympathy}}
On 31 October 2005, Fanning released his debut solo album entitled ''[[Tea & Sympathy]]''.<ref name=AMOTnS>{{cite web|url=http://www.amo.org.au/release.asp?id=7506|title=Tea & Sympathy - Bernard Fanning|publisher=[[Australian Music Online]]|accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref> The album debuted at #1 on the Australian [[ARIA Albums chart]], and spent 58&nbsp;weeks in the top&nbsp;50. It peaked at #11 during its 18-week stay on the [[New Zealand]] [[RIANZ|albums chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Bernard+Fanning&titel=Tea+%26+Sympathy&cat=a |title=Bernard Fanning - Tea & Sympathy|publisher=australian-charts.com|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref>

''Tea & Sympathy'' comprised songs Fanning had written in his time with Powderfinger, as well as new content written after the band went on hiatus. Most of the writing was done in what Fanning described as a "creative burst" between March and May 2005.<ref name=AMOTnS /> Much of the inspiration for the work on the album came from Fanning's reaction to the death of his brother in 2002, and to the ending of a 12-year relationship with his girlfriend.<ref name="Divola, Barry">{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/bernard-fanning/2006/10/12/1160246251381.html |title=Solo success doesn't make Bernard Fanning a loner.|publisher=''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''|author=Divola, Barry|date=12 October 2006|accessdate=2008-03-07}}</ref> The majority of the album was recorded at [[Real World Studios]] with [[Tchad Blake]] in June 2005, except for "Not Finished Just Yet", "Believe", "Wash Me Clean", and "Hope & Validation", which were recorded at Fanning's Brisbane home. Fanning was supported by Brisbane musicians [[Jerry Marotta]], [[Keith Duffy (bassist)|Keith Duffy]], and John Bedggood, who also formed part of his live band. The album was developed in a relaxed manner, with Fanning stating, "We had a ball putting the songs together."<ref name=AMOTnS />

Three singles were released from the album. The most successful of these was the lead single, "[[Wish You Well]]", shortly followed by "[[Songbird (Bernard Fanning song)|Songbird]]". These releases were only sold as [[music download|digital download]] singles. The third single from the album, "[[Watch Over Me (song)|Watch Over Me]]", was the only to be released as a CD single and achieved minor success on the Australian singles chart. It entered the chart on 9 July 2006 at #16, and spent eight weeks in the top 50.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?key=251268&cat=s |title=Bernard Fanning - Watch Over Me|publisher=australian-charts.com|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> On 26 January 2006, "Wish You Well" was voted #1 for the [[Triple J Hottest 100]], [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2005|2005]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100/history/2005.htm|title=Hottest 100 - History - 2005|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|work=[[Triple J]]|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Following "Watch Over Me", Fanning digitally released a fourth single "[[Weekend of Mystery]]", which was not officially on the album, except for those who purchased the album from the [[iTunes store]]. Fanning also took home the award for Best Music Video at the 2006 ARIA Awards for the iconic 'Wish You Well' clip.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movideo.com/videooftheday/clipdate_desc/853/Bernard-Fanning-Wish-You-Well |title=Movideo- Video of the Day. |publisher=Movideo |accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>

On 2 December 2005, Fanning announced a nationwide [[Which Way Home Concert Tour]], named after the song on the album of the same name. Fanning played seven shows between 25 February and 10 March 2006, in all of Australia's major [[List of Australian capital cities|capital cities]]. He was supported by [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] band [[The Panics]] and Brisbane singer Andrew Morris.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dew-process.com/artists-newsfull.cfm?id=3&artist=1 |title=Bernard Fanning announces Which Way Home?

[[Image:Bernard Fanning London 2007.jpg|thumb|Bernard performing with Powderfinger at London's Hammersmith Apollo, on 6 December 2007]]
{{seealso|Powderfinger}}
Throughout 2006, Fanning had hinted towards [[Powderfinger]] ceasing their hiatus to release a sixth studio album. Recorded in [[Los Angeles]], ''[[Dream Days at the Hotel Existence]]'' was released on 2 June 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s1898994.htm |title=New Powderfinger Album Details |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|work=[[Triple J]]|date=April 17, 2007|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> The title of the album came from a chapter of ''[[Brooklyn Follies]]'' by [[Paul Auster]], a book that Fanning had read during recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://channelv.com.au/V/Article.aspx?id=1004 |title=Powderfinger's new LP, Dream Days at the Hotel Existence is out June 2, 2007. |publisher=[[Channel V]]|accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref> The album debuted at #1 on the Australian [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] Albums chart.<ref name="aus-charts">{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/search.asp?search=Powderfinger&cat=a|title=Powderfinger albums|publisher=australian-charts.com|accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref>

Powderfinger toured around Australia and New Zealand with [[Silverchair]] on the [[Across the Great Divide tour]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,22029471-5005368,00.html |title=Across the Great Divide|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|work=[[PerthNow]]|date=7 July 2007|accessdate=2008-03-03}}</ref> The tour's aim was to promote the efforts of [[Reconciliation Australia]] to reduce the 17-year life expectancy gap between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Australians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reconcile.org.au/music/media/ReconciliationAustralia.pdf |title=Across the Great Divide for Reconcile.org.au|publisher=[[Reconciliation Australia]]|format=[[PDF]]|accessdate=2008-03-03}}</ref> Fanning said of the tour, "The idea is to show both bands are behind the idea of reconciliation."<ref name=DunnBT>{{cite web|url= http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/music/in-concert--rock-and-reconciliation/2007/06/12/1181414306040.html |title=In concert - rock and reconciliation|date=June 13, 2007|publisher=[[Brisbane Times]]|author=Dunn, Emily |accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref>

==Style, technique, and influences==
Fanning has been described as having a strong vocal range when singing, but has stated that he is not highly confident in his voice. In a 1998 interview, Fanning said, "I don't think I have the perfect voice or anything",<ref name=TP? /> and stated that delivering the message of the song was more important than "showing off [his] chops".<ref name=TP? /> He noted he was not interested in singing for the purpose of singing alone, but rather because he enjoyed getting the purpose of the song across.<ref name=TP?>{{cite news |title=Talkin' Politics?|work=Beat|author=Johnson, Neala |date=December 1998}}</ref> Fanning has stated: "For me, writing songs comes from anywhere", drawing inspiration from his experiences.<ref name=TnSCST />

In his work on ''[[Tea & Sympathy]]'', Fanning noted less of a collaborative song style, referring to his inability to play [[guitar solo]]s as causing different elements to become a focus of the songs. In an interview, he said, "I wasn't relying on solos to be big features because I simply can't play them."<ref name=TnSCST /> Fanning explained that the shorter length of songs was due to him not having "four other people" to back him up when producing independently.<ref name=TnSCST>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=983 |title=Bernard Fanning stirs up "Tea & Sympathy"|month=October | year=2006|author=Baker, Brian|publisher=Country Standard Time|accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref>

==Political and moral stances==
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:left; width:30%; float:left; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">For me, reconciliation is not about casting blame, financial compensation or bringing shame on anyone. It is about accepting there have been wrongdoings in the past that have left Aborigines here in a position of distinct disadvantage.<p style="text-align: right;"><U+2014>Bernard Fanning<ref name=SMAde /></blockquote>
Fanning has stated that although political messages may be common throughout his and Powderfinger's music, it is not the central focus when writing songs: "A balance has to be struck in a lot of ways, in the sense that primarily I'm a musician. I'm not a political commentator. So if I write a song that has political content, then hopefully that song is a good enough song to make it onto my record. And if it's not, then that's just a song that I've written. So I don't think it necessarily needs to be that you're definitively trying to make a political statement."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2006/s1777061.htm |title=Midnight Oil calls for more protest songs|author=Kruger, Paula |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=2008-02-17|date=October 31, 2006}}</ref> He has stated that he has no interest in "doing a '[[Peter Garrett]]'", who entered politics after a successful [[Midnight Oil]] career.<ref name=nine>{{cite web|url=http://video.msn.com/dw.aspx?mkt=en-au&brand=ninemsn&from=truveo&vid=3d38ac55-1b5b-4047-a0ce-411e5d087805|title=Roast a Rock Star: Powderfinger|publisher=[[ninemsn]]|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref>

On 8 July 2007, Fanning wrote a piece for [[Adelaide]]'s ''[[Sunday Mail (Adelaide)|Sunday Mail]]'', telling of his recent trip to [[Uluru]]. In the piece, he criticised those who [[Uluru#Climbing|climbed]] the rock, stating that he was "appalled that kids were being taught to disrespect the wishes of Aboriginal people on their own land".<ref name=SMAde /> Upon returning from Uluru, Fanning wrote "[[Black Tears]]", which intended to "document a relationship gone wrong".<ref name=SMAde /> In his piece, Fanning also criticised the 17-year life expectancy gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians, and encouraged all to join a conversation on reconciliation.<ref name=SMAde>{{cite news|title=Reconciling the head and heart |author=Fanning, Bernard|publisher=''[[Sunday Mail (Adelaide)|Sunday Mail]]''|date=8 July 2007}}<!-- http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Peripitus/Sandbox&oldid=196510043 --></ref>

Fanning takes a [[left wing politics|left-leaning]] political stance, although he claims he is not fond of discussing the issue. Rather, he attempts to discuss the issues through his songs; "I approach writing a song about something like [Aboriginal affairs] the same way I would approach writing a song about a relationship, because it's something that I feel strongly about."<ref name=DomPost /> However, he has occasionally stated his views on social and political issues, giving ''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]'' his stance on Aboriginal affairs in light of the Across the Great Divide tour;
{{cquote|1=The trial of the policeman that was charged has gone ahead and he was acquitted. In terms of that issue, that's out of the way, but the whole idea of Aboriginal people in custody dying is certainly not out of the way. And Aboriginal people being treated like shit in Australia is certainly not out of the way either.<ref name=DomPost>{{cite news|title=The politics of rock|publisher=''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]''|date=12 October 2007|author=Kelly, Andrew}}<!-- http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Peripitus/Sandbox&oldid=196509704 --></ref>}}

==Personal life==
Fanning has performed numerous philanthropic tasks independently and with Powderfinger. The band played at the 2005 [[WaveAid]] concert to raise money for victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2005/01/29/1291579.htm |title=Thousands to turn out for Wave Aid|publisher=[[abc.net.au]]|date=29 January 2005|accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref> and the [[Across the Great Divide tour]] in 2007 to promote the efforts of [[Reconciliation Australia]].<ref name=DunnBT /> Fanning has contributed to charities including "A Just Australia" and Youngcare Australia, and donates his time to [[youth detention center|youth detention centres]] in Brisbane by running songwriting workshops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockus.com.au/current/news/0605/07.html |title=Bernard Fanning announces support for YoungCare|publisher=''Rockus Online Magazine''|date=6 May 2006|accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/queensland/stories/s1495126.htm|title=Musician Bernard Fanning|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=November 1, 2005|author=Fidler, Richard et al.|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> In an uncharacteristic outburst, Fanning once referred to fellow Australian artist [[Ben Lee]] as "a precocious little c--t", after Lee made the comment that he was "the saviour of Australian music".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thescene.com.au/Music/Features/-Ben-Lee/ |title=''Ben Lee''.|publisher=''[[The Scene]]''|author=Weaver, Andrew|date=20 September 2007|accessdate=2008-03-07}}</ref> Fanning later apologised for the comment.<ref name="Divola, Barry" />
