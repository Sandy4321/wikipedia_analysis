==History==
State Route 116 was first added to the state highway system in 1931, consisting of the current alignment but extending farther to the west through Moroni to the forest boundary at Maple Canyon.<ref name="116 resolution 1931">{{cite UTSR law|year=1931|quote=(116) From Mt. Pleasant westerly via Moroni to forest boundary at Maple canyon.}}</ref> In 1933, the route was extended further west to the forks of Maple Canyon.<ref name="116 resolution 1933">{{cite UTSR law|year=1933|chapter=30|quote=Route 118. From route 11 between Central and Elsinore south to Monroe, thence westerly to Joseph on route 11.}}</ref> The route was subsequently truncated at its western end, relinquishing the roadway west of Moroni back to local jurisdiction, resulting in the present-day alignment.
