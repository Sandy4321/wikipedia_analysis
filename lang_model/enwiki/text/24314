The '''Chichester Range''' is a range in the [[Pilbara]] region of [[Western Australia]].
The range rises abruptly from the coastal plain and is composed of rolling hills, escarpments, jagged peaks, gorges and winding tree-lined watercourses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/hotproperty/property/national-parks/millstream-chichester-national-park.html|title=Department of Environment and Conservation - Parkfinder|year=2009|accessdate=2009-04-23}}</ref>

The range is best described as an [[escarpment]] with a height of {{convert|350|m|ft|0|lk=on}} forming a [[tableland]] behind that slope gently to the South until it runs into the Hamersley Range. The steep escarpment is defined by a jumble of weathered [[basalt]]s and [[granophyre]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/component/option,com_docman/Itemid,1/gid,1932/task,doc_download/|title=Millstream-Chichester National Park and Mungaroona Range Nature Reserve - Draft Management Plan|year=2007|accessdate=2009-04-23}}</ref>

Geologically the range is made up of a mixture sandstone and igneous rocks and is part of the Pilbara Craton.

The area was named by the explorer [[Francis Thomas Gregory]] in 1861 after the British Undersecratry Chichester Samuel Fortescue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://editorial.australiangeographic.com/journal/index_journal.aspx?ID=132|title=Australian Geographic - Springs Eternal|year=2009|accessdate=2009-04-23}}</ref>

The [[Indigenous Australians|traditional owners]] of the area are the Bailgu or Palyku peoples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausanthrop.net/resources/ausanthrop_db/detail.php?id_search=30|title=AusAnthrop Australian Aboriginal tribal database|year=2009|accessdate=2009-04-23}}</ref>

The range is the basis of two major river basins; the [[Fortescue River|Fortescue]] Basin and the Port Hedland coast Basin.
The Port Hedland Coast Basin is the catchment area for many rivers including the [[Harding River]], [[Sherlock River (Western Australia)|Sherlock River]], [[Yule River]] and [[Shaw River]].
