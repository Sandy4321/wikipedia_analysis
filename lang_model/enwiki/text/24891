'''Jamsehdpur''' {{audio|Jamshedpur.ogg|pronunciation}} (<U+091C><U+092E><U+0936><U+0947><U+0926><U+092A><U+0942><U+0930> in [[Devanagari]]) is a city located in the state of [[Jharkand]] in [[India]] founded by the late [[Jamshedji Tata|Jamshedji Nusserwanji Tata]] as Sakchi. In [[1919]] [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] named it '''Jamshedpur''', in honour of its founder, whose birthday is celebrated on [[3rd March]] as Founder's Day. J. N. Tata had written to his son Dorabji Tata about his vision of a great city in the area. 

Early development work was undertaken by Durrell & Co, a [[civil engineering]] firm run by [[Lawrence Samuel Durrell]], the father of the naturalist [[Gerald Durrell]] (who was born here) and the novelist [[Lawrence Durrell]].  Commissioned by the Tata family in 1920, Durrell was responsible for building a tinplate mill, a brick-making plant, an office building, a hospital and over four hundred workers<U+2019> houses.  Located in the [[East Singhbhum]] district of [[Jharkhand]] on the [[Chota Nagpur Plateau|Chota Nagpur]] [[plateau]], Jamshedpur is surrounded by the beautiful [[Dalma Hills]], and the rivers [[Subarnrekha]] and [[Kharkhai]] border the North & West of the city, respectively.

Jamshedpur is home to the first private Iron and Steel company of India, [[Tata Steel]], and is commonly called "Tata" as a result of the company's significant presence. The areas surrounding Jamshedpur are rich in minerals, including [[iron ore]], [[coal]], [[manganese]] and [[Lime (mineral)|lime]]. Some of these areas are Jamadoba, [[Noamundi]] and West Bokaro.

The city recently won international acclaim when it was selected for the 2004 Global Compact City award from the UN in India, beating other contenders such as Bangalore, Pune and Chandigarh, amongst others. A true testimony indeed to its robust infrastructure, cosmopolitan outlook and strong industry.

It is a modern, industrial city; the main industries being [[iron]] and [[steel]], truck manufacturing, tinplate production, cement and other small and medium scale industries revolving around these products. The largest factory is that of [[Tata Steel]] (the erstwhile TISCO), and it is situated almost at the center of the city. The other major factory in the city is [[Tata Motors]] (previously called The Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (TELCO)- as once upon time railway locomotives used to be manufactured here - hence the name), which manufactures heavy vehicles & construction/earth moving equipment. Tata Tinplate (the erstwhile Tinplate Co. of India Ltd.) manufactures tinplate. It was originally a British company built in Golmuri, later on taken over by Tata. Most of the Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are located just outside Jamshedpur, in the Adityapur Industrial Estate.

Jamshedpur is host to one of the best business schools in India - [[XLRI]] which is known for its Personnel Management & Industrial Relations program.

Life in the city is comfortable, with all areas having 24 hours running water and electricity. Facilities are maintained by Jamshedpur Utilities and Services Company Limited (JUSCO), a 100% owned subsidiary of [[Tata Steel]]. However, areas not maintained by JUSCO experience intermittent power cuts, bad roads and government apathy. Jamshedpur is also called the Steel City. It is one of the greenest cities of India.

The conversational language is Hindi, though the city itself is cosmopolitan in nature. The main ethnic groups are Biharis, Adivasis and Bengalis, however there are a large number of Punjabis, Oriyas and South Indians as well. The major festivals are Deepavali, Holi, Durga Puja (Dussehra), Id-ul-fitr. Adivasis celebrate 'Tusu', Biharis celebrate Chhat and Bengalis celebrate Durga Puja.
