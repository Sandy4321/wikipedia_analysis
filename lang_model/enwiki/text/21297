'''Alfred George Fripp''' (13 June 1914&nbsp;<U+2013>3 January 2013), known as '''"Alfie"''' or '''"Bill"''',<ref name="Indep"/><ref name="DailyMail"/> was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Air Force]] [[squadron leader]] who was a [[flight sergeant]] during the [[Second World War]].<ref name="BBCge" >{{citation|month=25 March|year=2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7962707.stm|title='Great Escape'|journal=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=10 January 2013|ref=harv|last=Staff}}</ref> He was shot down by the [[Luftwaffe]] in 1939 and held in twelve different [[prisoner of war]] camps, including [[Stalag Luft III]], later the site of the "[[Stalag Luft III escape|The Great Escape]]".  As the last of the "39ers" (those taken prisoner in the first year of the war), he was the oldest surviving and longest serving British POW.<ref name="Indep"/><ref name="BBCDorset" >{{citation|month=3 January|year=2013|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-20899976|title=Alfie Fripp, prisoner of war at Stalag Luft III, dies aged 98|journal=BBC News Dorset|accessdate=9 January 2013|ref=harv}}</ref>

==Early life==

Fripp was born in [[Alverstoke]] ([[Hampshire]], [[England]]){{cn|date=January 2013}}<!--surely, there's more known about his early life: his parents' names, where he was raised and educated, etc.--> on 13&nbsp;June 1914.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert | last=Fripp | title=Robert Fripp's Diary: Friday, 13th June 2008|publisher=[[Discipline Global Mobile]]|url=http://www.dgmlive.com|month=13 June|year=2008|accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref> He was raised in [[Wimborne Minster|Wimborne]] (Dorset England).<ref name="Echo"/>

== Royal Air Force career ==
[[File:HarrySagan2.jpg|thumb|leftalt=Tunnel Harry is now a memorial, which is marked stones naming prisoners who escaped and were murdered in a war crime ordered by Hitler.|As a POW, Fripp provided maps and tools for tunnelling the great escape from [[Stalag Luft III]].]]

Fripp's father was a regular in the [[Royal Marines]] and, from the age of twelve, Fripp had planned to become an [[Artificer Sergeant Major|artificer]] apprentice in the [[Royal Navy]]. He failed the medical exam, however, as he was almost four inches shorter than the requirement. When he learned the Royal Air&nbsp;Force was recruiting apprentices of all heights, he took the RAF entrance exam to become an electrical apprentice.<ref name="GE"/> Fripp enlisted in the RAF on 30 September 1930 at [[RAF Halton]], and in 1932 transferred to training for [[Radio|wireless]] operators. He joined [[No.&nbsp;57 Squadron RAF]] in 1939.<ref name="GE"/> Three days after the declaration of war on 3 September 1939, just before 57 Squadron was called to duty, Fripp married Vera Violet Allen.<ref name="GE"/>

==Prisoner of war==
On 13 October 1939, while on a reconnaissance mission as an [[Air observer|observer]], the [[Bristol Blenheim]] aircraft he was in was shot at, pursued, and forced into an emergency landing in Germany. Fripp and the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Mike Casey,<ref name="Indep"/> were captured, along with the third airman, all of whom emerged with bruises and scrapes.<ref name="Airman" /> From 1939 until 1945, Fripp was a [[prisoner of war]].<ref name="Indep"/>  On 25 October Fripp wrote a letter to his wife from  [[Stalag VII-A|Kriegs Gefanger, Stalag]] in [[Moosburg]], Germany; Fripp assured his wife of his well-being and suggested that Germany might be a nice place to visit for their honeymoon.<ref name="Airman" >{{cite news|year=1939|url=https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/402551_2357585639644_1734169800_n.jpg|last=Staff|first=|title=Airman to bride: I am safe|journal=(Newspaper clipping)|publisher=|location=|id=Alfie George Fripp on facebook|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref > He and six other airmen were allowed to record thirty-second Christmas messages to their families, which were broadcast on shortwave radio from Berlin; Fripp sent greetings to his mother and told his wife, "Although I shall not be at home with you in person, I shall be with you in spirit." His wife was staying at his mother's home in [[Wimborne Minster|Wimborne]].<ref name="Radio" >{{cite news|url=https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/399785_2406255816368_651748094_n.jpg|last=Staff|first=|title=R.A.F.

Fripp was imprisoned at Stalag Luft III, the site of an escape attempt by an international group of prisoners of war in March 1944. A fictionalised version of the escape was depicted in the 1963 film, ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]''.<ref name="Indep"/> Before the escape, Fripp collected parcels from the [[Red Cross]], some of which contained maps and equipment such as radio parts. While Fripp was collecting the parcels, he occasionally "liberated" tools, such as steel files and wire cutters, which were used to dig the tunnel.<ref name="DailyMail"/> Fripp was moved to another [[stalag]] two months before the escape. His pilot, Casey, escaped from Stalag Luft III, but he was recaptured and [[Stalag Luft III murders|murdered (along with forty-nine other escaped prisoners)]] on the orders of [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref name="GE"/>

Fripp was held in eleven other prison camps, in which he often served as a representative of the Red Cross. At the end of the war, he and other POWs were forced into "[[The March (1945)|The Long March]]" from Poland to Germany, as German forces retreated before the [[Red Army|Army of the Soviet Union]].<ref name="Indep"/>

Fripp continued to serve in the RAF until 1969 and attained the rank of [[Squadron Leader]].<ref name="Indep"/>
