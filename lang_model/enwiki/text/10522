'''Louis Riel''' ([[October 22]], [[1844]] &ndash; [[November 16]], [[1885]]) was a [[Politics of Canada|Canadian politician]], a founder of the province of [[Manitoba]], and leader of the [[M<U+00E9>tis people (Canada)|M<U+00E9>tis]] people of the [[Canadian prairies]].<ref>{{cite web  | publisher =A database of materials held by the University of Saskatchewan Libraries and the University Archives

Macdonald]] that sought to preserve M<U+00E9>tis rights and culture as their homelands in the Northwest came progressively under the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[sphere of influence]].

The first such resistance was the [[Red River Rebellion]] of 1869&ndash;1870.<ref name="martyr">{{cite web

While a [[fugitive]], he was elected three times to the [[Canadian House of Commons]], although he never assumed his seat. During these years, he was frustrated by having to remain in exile despite his growing belief that he was a [[Divine right|divinely chosen]] leader and prophet, a belief which would later resurface and influence his actions. He married in 1881 while in [[exile]] in [[Montana]], and fathered three children. He became a naturalized American citizen and was actively involved in the Republican party.

Riel returned to what is now the province of [[Saskatchewan]] to represent M<U+00E9>tis grievances to the [[Canadian government]]. This resistance escalated into a military confrontation known as the [[North-West Rebellion]] of 1885. It ended in his arrest, [[Jury trial|trial]], and eventual [[Capital punishment|execution]] on a charge of [[Treason Act 1351|high treason]]. Riel was viewed sympathetically in [[francophone]] regions of Canada, and his execution had a lasting influence on relations between the province of [[Quebec]] and [[English language|English-speaking]] Canada. Whether seen as a [[Canadian Confederation|Father of Confederation]] or a traitor, he remains one of the most complex, controversial, and ultimately tragic figures in the [[history of Canada]].<ref name="LouisRielCE">{{cite web

==Early life==
[[Image:YoungLouisRiel.gif|thumb|150px|left|Louis Riel, age 14]]
The [[Red River Colony|Red River Settlement]] was a community in [[Rupert's Land]] nominally administered by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC), and largely inhabited by [[First Nations]] tribes and the [[M<U+00E9>tis people (Canada)|M<U+00E9>tis]], an [[ethnic group]] of [[Mixed race|mixed]] [[Cree]], [[Ojibwa]]y, [[Saulteaux]], [[French Canadian]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], and [[English people|English]] descent.<ref>{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-09-23 }}</ref> Sayer's eventual release as a result of agitations by Louis Sr.'s group is credited with ending the monopoly, and the name Riel was therefore well known in the Red River. His mother was the daughter of [[Jean-Baptiste Lagimodi<U+00E8>re]] and [[Marie-Anne Gaboury]], one of the earliest white families to settle in the Red River Settlement in 1812. The Riels were noted for their devout Catholicism and strong family ties.

He was first educated by [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[priest]]s at [[Saint Boniface, Manitoba|St. Boniface]]. At age 13 he came to the attention of [[Alexandre Tach<U+00E9>]], the [[suffragan Bishop]] of St. Boniface, who was eagerly promoting the priesthood for talented young M<U+00E9>tis. In 1858 Tach<U+00E9> arranged for Riel to attend the [[Seminary#Youth seminaries|Petit S<U+00E9>minaire]] of the [[Coll<U+00E8>ge de Montr<U+00E9>al]] in [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal]], [[Quebec]] under the direction of the [[Society of Saint-Sulpice|Sulpician order]].<ref>{{cite web

Following news of his father's premature death in 1864, Riel lost interest in the priesthood and he withdrew from the college in March 1865. For a time he continued his studies as a day student in the [[convent]] of the [[Grey Nuns]], but was soon asked to leave following breaches of discipline. He remained in Montreal for a period, living at the home of his aunt, Lucie Riel. Impoverished by the death of his father, Riel took employment as a law clerk in the Montreal office of [[Rodolphe Laflamme]].{{Failed verification|date=October 2007}}<ref>{{cite web

Compounding this disappointment, Riel found legal work unpleasant, and perhaps as early as 1866 he had resolved to leave Quebec. He is believed to have worked odd jobs in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] while staying with poet [[Louis-Honor<U+00E9> Fr<U+00E9>chette]], and was then for a time employed as a clerk in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], [[Minnesota]] prior to returning to the Red River on [[July 26]], [[1868]].

==Red River Rebellion==
{{main|Red River Rebellion}}
The majority population of the Red River had historically been M<U+00E9>tis and [[First Nations]] people. But upon his return, Riel found that religious, nationalistic, and racial tensions were being exacerbated by an influx of [[Anglophone]] [[Protestant]] settlers from Ontario. The political situation was also uncertain, as ongoing negotiations for the transfer of Rupert's Land from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) to Canada had not addressed the political terms of transfer. Finally, despite warnings to the [[John A. Macdonald|Macdonald]] government from Bishop Tach<U+00E9> and the HBC governor [[William Mactavish]] that any such activity would precipitate unrest, the Canadian minister of public works, [[William McDougall (politician)|William McDougall]], ordered a survey of the area.{{Verify credibility|date=October 2007}}{{Failed verification|date=October 2007}}<ref>{{cite web

=== Riel emerges as a leader ===
In late August, Riel denounced the survey in a speech, and on [[October 11]] [[1869]], the survey's work was disrupted by a group of M<U+00E9>tis that included Riel. This group organized itself as the "M<U+00E9>tis National Committee" on [[October 16]], with Riel as secretary and [[John Bruce (Canada)|John Bruce]] as president.<ref>{{cite web

Nevertheless, the non-bilingual McDougall was appointed the [[lieutenant governor]]-designate, and attempted to enter the settlement on [[November 2]]. McDougall's party was turned back near the American border, and on the same day, M<U+00E9>tis led by Riel seized [[Fort Garry]].<ref>{{cite web

On [[November 6]], Riel invited Anglophones to attend a convention alongside M<U+00E9>tis representatives to discuss a course of action, and on [[December 1]] he proposed to this convention a list of rights to be demanded as a condition of union. Much of the settlement came to accept the M<U+00E9>tis point of view, but a passionately pro-Canadian minority began organizing in opposition.

Riel ordered Schultz's home surrounded, and the outnumbered Canadians soon surrendered and were imprisoned in [[Upper Fort Garry]].

=== Provisional government ===

Smith assured large audiences of the Government's goodwill in meetings on [[January 19]] and [[January 20]], leading Riel to propose the formation of a new convention split evenly between French and English settlers to consider Smith's instructions. On [[February 7]], a new list of rights was presented to the Ottawa delegation, and Smith and Riel agreed to send representatives to Ottawa to engage in direct negotiations on that basis.

=== Canadian resistance and the execution of Scott ===
Despite the apparent progress on the political front, the Canadian party continued to plot against the provisional government. However, they suffered a setback on [[February 17]], when 48 men, including Boulton and [[Thomas Scott (Orangeman)|Thomas Scott]], were apprehended near Fort Garry.

After repeatedly quarreling with his guards, they insisted that Scott be tried for [[insubordination]]. At his trial, he was found guilty of defying the authority of the provisional government and was sentenced to death. Riel was repeatedly entreated to commute the sentence, but Donald Smith reported that Riel responded to his pleas by saying:

=== Creation of Manitoba and the Wolseley expedition ===
The delegates representing the provisional government departed for Ottawa in March. Although they initially met with legal difficulties arising from the execution of Scott, they were soon able to enter into direct talks with Macdonald and [[George-<U+00C9>tienne Cartier]]. An agreement enshrining the demands in the list of rights was quickly reached, and this formed the basis for the [[Manitoba Act]] of [[May 12]], [[1870]],{{Verify credibility|date=October 2007}}<ref>{{cite web

As a means of exercising Canadian authority in the settlement and dissuading [[Manifest destiny|American expansionists]], a Canadian [[Wolseley Expedition|military expedition]] under [[Colonel]] [[Garnet Wolseley]] was dispatched to the Red River.<ref>{{cite web

The arrival of the expedition on [[August 20]] marked the effective end of the [[Red River Rebellion]].

However the results of the first provincial election in December 1870 were promising for Riel, as many of his supporters came to power. Nevertheless, stress and financial troubles precipitated a serious illness<U+2014>perhaps a harbinger of his future mental afflictions<U+2014>that prevented his return to Manitoba until May 1871. [[Image:LouisRielPortrait.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Louis Riel circa 1875]]The settlement now faced another threat, this time from cross-border [[Fenian Brotherhood|Fenian]] raids coordinated by his former associate [[William Bernard O'Donoghue]].<ref>{{cite web

Companies of armed horsemen were raised, including one led by Riel. When Archibald reviewed the troops in St. Boniface, he made the significant gesture of publicly shaking Riel's hand, signaling that a rapprochement had been effected. But this was not to be<U+2014>when this news reached Ontario, Mair and members of the [[Canada First]] movement whipped up a significant resurgence of anti-Riel (and anti-Archibald) sentiment. With Federal elections coming in 1872, Macdonald could ill afford further rift in Quebec-Ontario relations. He therefore quietly arranged for Tach<U+00E9> to offer Riel what amounted to a bribe of [[Canadian dollars|$]]1,000 to enter voluntary exile. This was supplemented by an additional [[Pound Sterling|<U+00A3>]]600 from Smith for the care of Riel's family. Riel accepted, arriving in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] on [[March 2]] [[1872]]. However, by late June Riel was back in Manitoba and was soon convinced to run as a member of [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]] for the electoral district of [[Provencher (electoral district)|Provencher]]. However, following the early September defeat of Cartier in his home riding in Quebec, Riel stood aside so that Cartier<U+2014>on record as being in favour of amnesty for Riel<U+2014>might secure a seat. Cartier won by acclamation, but Riel's hopes for a swift resolution to the amnesty question were dashed following Cartier's death on [[May 20]], [[1873]]. In the ensuing by-election in October 1873, Riel ran unopposed, although he had once again fled, a warrant having been issued for his arrest in September. L<U+00E9>pine was not so lucky; he was captured and faced trial. Riel made his way to Montreal and, fearing arrest or [[assassination]], vacillated as to whether he should attempt to take up his seat in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]]<U+2014>[[Edward Blake]], the [[Premier of Ontario]], had announced a bounty of $5,000 for his arrest.<ref>{{cite web | title =Louis Riel (1844<U+2013>1885): Biography Louis Riel, M<U+00E9>tis leader | url = http://www.museevirtuel.ca/Exhibitions/Batoche/docs/proof_en_riel_bio.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-09-23 }}</ref> Famously, Riel was the only [[Member of Parliament]] who was not present for the great [[Pacific Scandal]] debate of 1873 that led to the resignation of the Macdonald government in November. [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] leader [[Alexander Mackenzie]] became the interim [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], and a general election was held in January 1874. Although the Liberals under Mackenzie formed the new government, Riel easily retained his seat. Formally, Riel had to sign a register book at least once upon being elected, and he did so under disguise in late January. He was nevertheless stricken from the rolls following a motion supported by Schultz, who had become the member for the electoral district of [[Lisgar (electoral district)|Lisgar]].<ref>{{cite web

Undeterred, Riel prevailed once again in the resulting by-election, and although once again expelled, his symbolic point had been made and public opinion in Quebec was strongly tipped in his favour.

=== Exile and mental illness ===
During this period, Riel had been staying near [[Plattsburgh (town), New York|Plattsburgh]], [[New York]] in the French-Canadian village of Keesville. It was here that he received news of L<U+00E9>pine's fate: following his trial for the murder of Scott, which had begun on [[October 13]] [[1874]], L<U+00E9>pine was found guilty and sentenced to death. This sparked outrage in the sympathetic Quebec press, and calls for amnesty for both L<U+00E9>pine and Riel were renewed. This presented a severe political difficulty for Mackenzie, who was hopelessly caught between the demands of Quebec and Ontario. However, a solution was forthcoming when, acting on his own initiative, the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]] commuted L<U+00E9>pine's sentence in January 1875. This opened the door for Mackenzie to secure from parliament an amnesty for Riel, on that the condition that he remain in exile for five years.<ref name="LouisRielCE"/>

Spurred on by a sympathetic Roman Catholic priest in Quebec, he was increasingly influenced by his belief that he was a divinely chosen leader of the M<U+00E9>tis.

But with insufficient means to propose marriage, Riel returned to the west, hoping that she might follow. However, she decided that she would be unsuited to prairie life, and their correspondence soon ended.

=== Montana and family life ===
In the fall of 1878, Riel returned to St. Paul, and briefly visited his friends and family. This was a time of rapid change for the M<U+00E9>tis of the Red River<U+2014>the [[American Bison|buffalo]] on which they depended were becoming increasingly scarce, the influx of settlers was ever-increasing, and lots of land were sold to unscrupulous land speculators. Like other Red River M<U+00E9>tis who had left Manitoba, Riel headed further west in order to start a new life. Travelling to the [[Montana Territory]], he became a trader and interpreter in the area surrounding [[Fort Benton, Montana|Fort Benton]]. Observing rampant [[alcoholism]] and its detrimental impact on the Native American and M<U+00E9>tis people, he engaged in an unsuccessful attempt to curtail the [[whisky]] trade. In 1881, he married Marguerite Monet ''dit'' Bellehumeur (1861&ndash;1886),<ref>{{cite web

They were to have three children: Jean-Louis (1882&ndash;1908); Marie-Ang<U+00E9>lique (1883&ndash;1897); and a boy that was born and died on [[October 21]], [[1885]], less than one month before Riel was hanged.

Riel soon became involved in the politics of Montana, and in 1882, actively campaigned on behalf of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He brought a suit against a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] for rigging a vote, but was then himself accused of fraudulently inducing [[British subject]]s to take part in the election. In response, Riel applied for [[United States]] citizenship and was [[naturalized]] on [[March 16]], [[1883]]. With two young children, he had by 1884 settled down and was teaching school at the St. Peter's [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] mission in the [[Sun River]] district of Montana.

== The North-West Rebellion ==
{{main|North-West Rebellion}}

=== Grievances in the Saskatchewan territory ===
Following the Red River Rebellion, M<U+00E9>tis travelled west and settled in the [[Saskatchewan Valley]], especially along the south branch of the river in the country surrounding the Saint-Laurent mission (near modern [[Grandin, Saskatchewan]]). But by the 1880s, it had become clear that westward migration was no panacea for the troubles of the M<U+00E9>tis and the plains Indians. The rapid collapse of the buffalo herd was causing near starvation among the [[Plains Cree]] and [[Blackfoot]] [[First Nations]]. This was exacerbated by a reduction in government assistance in 1883, and by a general failure of Ottawa to live up to its treaty obligations. The M<U+00E9>tis were likewise obliged to give up the hunt and take up agriculture<U+2014>but this transition was accompanied by complex issues surrounding land claims similar to those that had previously arisen in Manitoba. Moreover, settlers from Europe and the eastern provinces were also moving into the Saskatchewan territories, and they too had complaints related to the administration of the territories. Virtually all parties therefore had grievances, and by 1884 English settlers, [[Anglo-M<U+00E9>tis]] and M<U+00E9>tis communities were holding meetings and petitioning a largely unresponsive government for redress. In the electoral district of [[Lorne (N.W.T. electoral district)|Lorne]], a meeting of the south branch M<U+00E9>tis was held in the village of [[Batoche, Saskatchewan|Batoche]] on [[March 24]], and thirty representatives voted to ask Riel to return and represent their cause. On [[May 6]] a joint "Settler's Union" meeting was attended by both the M<U+00E9>tis and English-speaking representatives from [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]], including [[William Henry Jackson]],<Ref>{{cite web

Riel also intended to use the new position of influence to pursue his own land claims in Manitoba. The party departed [[June 4]], and arrived back at Batoche on [[July 5]]. Upon his arrival M<U+00E9>tis and English settlers alike formed an initially favourable impression of Riel following a series of speeches in which he advocated moderation and a reasoned approach. During June 1884, the Plains Cree leaders [[Big Bear]]<ref>{{Citation

However, the Indian's grievances were quite different from those of the settlers, and nothing was then resolved. Inspired by Riel, Honor<U+00E9> Jackson and representatives of other communities set about drafting a petition, and Jackson on [[July 28]] released a manifesto detailing grievances and the settler's objectives. A joint English-M<U+00E9>tis central committee with Jackson acting as secretary worked to reconcile proposals from different communities. In the interim, Riel's support began to waver. As Riel's religious pronouncements became increasingly removed from Roman Catholicism, the clergy began to distance themselves, and father [[Alexis Andr<U+00E9>]] cautioned Riel against mixing religion and politics. Also, in response to bribes by territorial [[lieutenant-governor]] and Indian commissioner [[Edgar Dewdney]],<ref>{{cite web

Nevertheless, the work continued, and on [[December 16]] Riel forwarded the committee's petition to the government, along with the suggestion that delegates be sent to Ottawa to engage in direct negotiation. Receipt of the petition was acknowledged by [[Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau]], Macdonald's Secretary of State, although Macdonald himself would later deny having ever seen it.

=== Break with the church ===
While Riel awaited news from Ottawa he considered returning to Montana, but had by February resolved to stay. In the absence of a productive course of action, Riel began to engage in obsessive prayer, and was, in fact, experiencing a significant relapse of his mental agitations. This led to a deterioration in his relationship with the Catholic hierarchy, as he publicly espoused an increasingly [[Christian heresy|heretical]] doctrine. On [[February 11]], [[1885]], a response to the petition was received. The government proposed to take a census of the North-West Territories, and to form a commission to investigate grievances. This angered the M<U+00E9>tis, who interpreted this as a mere delaying tactic<U+2014>a faction emerged that favoured taking up arms at once. This was not supported by the Church, the majority of the English-speaking community, or, indeed, by the M<U+00E9>tis faction supporting local leader [[Charles Nolin]].<ref>{{Citation

In the church at Saint-Laurent on [[March 15]], Riel disrupted a sermon to argue for this position, following which he was barred from receiving the [[sacrament]]s, and increasingly frequently discussed his "divine revelations". But disenchanted with the status quo, and swayed by Riel's charisma and eloquent rhetoric, M<U+00E9>tis remained loyal to Riel, despite his proclamations that [[Bishop]] [[Ignace Bourget]]<ref>{{cite web

=== Open rebellion ===
On [[March 18]] it became known that the [[North-West Mounted Police]] garrison at Battleford was being reinforced. Although only 100 men had been sent in response to warnings from father [[Alexis Andr<U+00E9>]] and NWMP superintendent [[Leif Newry Fitzroy Crozier|L.N.F. Crozier]], a rumour soon began to circulate that 500 heavily armed troops were advancing on the territory. M<U+00E9>tis patience was exhausted, and Riel's followers seized arms, took hostages, and cut the telegraph lines between Batoche and Battleford. A provisional government was declared at Batoche on [[March 19]], with Riel<ref>{{cite web

The situation was becoming critical, and on [[March 23]] Dewdney sent a telegraph to Macdonald indicating that military intervention might be necessary. Scouting near Duck Lake on [[March 26]], a force led by Gabriel Dumont unexpectedly chanced upon a party from Fort Carlton. In the ensuing [[Battle of Duck Lake]], the police were routed, and the Indians also rose up once the news became known. The die was cast for a violent outcome, and the [[North-West Rebellion]] was begun in earnest.

[[Image:Louis Riel imprisoned in Middleton's Camp.jpg|thumb|left|Louis Riel imprisoned in Middleton's camp at Batoche, [[May 16]], [[1885]]]]
Riel had counted on the Canadian government being unable to effectively respond to another uprising in the distant [[North-West Territories]], thereby forcing them to accept political negotiation. This was essentially the same strategy that had worked to such great effect during the 1870 rebellion. But in that instance, the first troops did not arrive until three months after Riel seized control. However, Riel had completely overlooked the significance of the nascent [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. Despite major gaps in railway construction, the first Canadian regular and militia units, under the command of [[Major-General]] [[Frederick Dobson Middleton]], arrived in Duck Lake less than two weeks after Riel had made his demands.
Knowing that he could not defeat the Canadians in direct confrontation, Dumont had hoped to force the Canadians to negotiate by engaging in a long-drawn out campaign of [[guerrilla warfare]]; Dumont realised a modest success along these lines at the [[Battle of Fish Creek]] on [[April 24]], [[1885]].<ref>{{cite web

== Trial for treason ==
{{main|Trial of Louis Riel}}
Several individuals closely tied to the government requested that the trial be held in Winnipeg in July 1885. There are historians who contend that the trial was moved to Regina due to concerns with the possibility of an ethnically mixed and sympathetic jury.  [[Tom Flanagan (political scientist)|Tom Flanagan]] states that an amendment of the [[North-West Territories Act]] (which dropped the provision that trials with crimes punishable by death should be tried in Manitoba) meant that the trial could be convened within the North-West Territories and did not have to be held in Winnipeg. [[Image:RielAtTrial.jpg|thumb|300px|Louis Riel testifies at his trial]]
Prime Minister Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] ordered the trial to be convened in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], where Riel was tried before a jury of six [[England|English]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] Protestants, all from the area surrounding the city. The trial began on [[July 28]], [[1885]], and lasted only five days.<ref name="martyr"/>

Riel delivered two long speeches during his trial, defending his own actions and affirming the rights of the M<U+00E9>tis people. He rejected his lawyer's attempt to argue that he was [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]], asserting,

The jury found him guilty but recommended mercy; nonetheless, Judge [[Hugh Richardson (magistrate)|Hugh Richardson]] sentenced him to death, with the date of his execution initially set for [[September 18]], [[1885]].<ref name="trial"> Fifty years later one of the jurors, Edwin Brooks, said that Riel was tried for treason but hanged for the execution of Thomas Scott.

== Execution ==
Prior to his execution, Riel was reconciled with the Catholic church, and assigned Father Andr<U+00E9> as his spiritual advisor. He was also given writing materials so that he could employ his time in prison to write a book. <!--I do not believe that was the intent - even his mail was read --> Boulton writes in his memoirs that, as the date of his execution approached, Riel regretted his opposition to the defence of insanity and vainly attempted to provide evidence that he was not sane. After requests for a retrial and an appeal to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in England were denied, Louis Riel was [[hanging|hanged]] for treason on [[November 16]], [[1885]].<ref>{{cite web

[[Image:LouisRielTombstone.jpg|right|thumb|Riel's tombstone at the St. Boniface Cathedral]]
Boulton writes of Riel's final moments,

{{cquote|<U+2026> P<U+00E8>re Andr<U+00E9>, after explaining to Riel that the end was at hand, asked him if he was at peace with men. Riel answered ''"Yes."'' The next question was, ''"Do you forgive all your enemies?"'' ''"Yes."'' Riel then asked him if he might speak. Father Andr<U+00E9> advised him not to do so. He then received the kiss of peace from both the priests, and Father Andr<U+00E9> exclaimed in French, ''"Alors, allez au ciel!"'' meaning "so, to heaven!"

<U+2026> [Riel's] last words were to say good-bye to Dr. Jukes and thank him for his kindness, and just before the white cap was pulled over his face he said, ''"Remerciez, Madame Forget."'' meaning "thank, Ms. Forget".

The cap was pulled down, and while he was praying the trap was pulled. Death was not instantaneous. Louis Riel's pulse ceased four minutes after the trap-door fell and during that time the rope around his neck slowly strangled and choked him to death. The body was to have been interred inside the gallows' enclosure, and the grave was commenced, but an order came from the Lieutenant-Governor to hand the body over to Sheriff Chapleau which was accordingly done that night.}}

Sir John A. Macdonald, who was instrumental in upholding Riel's sentence, is famously quoted as saying

{{cquote|He shall hang though every dog in Quebec bark in his favour.<ref>{{cite web

Louis Riel was eventually hanged on November 16, 1885.

Following the execution, Riel's body was returned to his mother's home in [[St. Vital, Manitoba|St. Vital]], where it lay in state. On [[December 12]], [[1885]], his remains were laid in the churchyard of the [[Saint-Boniface Cathedral]] following the performance of a [[requiem mass]].

==Legacy==
=== Political ===
The Saskatchewan M<U+00E9>tis' requested land grants were all provided by the government by the end of 1887, and the government resurveyed the M<U+00E9>tis river lots in accordance with their wishes. The M<U+00E9>tis did not understand the long term value of their new land, however, and it was soon bought by speculators who later turned huge profits from it. Riel's worst fears were realised<U+2014>following the failed rebellion, the French language and Roman Catholic religion faced increasing marginalisation in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as exemplified by the controversy surrounding the [[Manitoba Schools Question]]. The M<U+00E9>tis themselves were increasingly forced to live on undesirable land or in the shadow of [[Indian reserve]]s (as they did not themselves have treaty status). Saskatchewan did not attain provincehood until 1905.

Riel's execution and Macdonald's refusal to commute his sentence caused lasting upset in Quebec, and led to a fundamental alteration in the Canadian political order. In Quebec, [[Honor<U+00E9> Mercier]]<Ref>{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-09-24 }}</ref> exploited discontent over Riel's execution to reconstitute the [[Parti National]]. This party, which promoted [[Quebec nationalism]], won a majority in the [[1886 Quebec election]] by winning a number of seats formerly controlled by the [[Quebec Conservative Party]]. The [[Canadian federal election, 1887|federal election of 1887]] likewise saw significant gains by the federal Liberals, again at the expense of the Conservatives. This led to the victory of the Liberal party under Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1896|federal election of 1896]], which in turn set the stage for the domination of Canadian federal politics by the Liberal party in the 20th century. That Riel's name still has resonance in Canadian politics was evidenced on [[November 16]], [[1994]], when [[Suzanne Tremblay]], a [[Bloc Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois]] member of parliament, introduced [[Private Member's Bill|private members' bill]] C-228, "An Act to revoke the conviction of Louis David Riel".<ref>{{cite web

=== Riel reconsidered ===
The formerly widespread perception of Louis Riel as an insane traitor, especially outside of the M<U+00E9>tis and [[French Canadian]] community, weakened considerably since the late 20th century. Riel is regarded as a hero who stood up for his people in the face of a [[racist]] government, and those who question his sanity still view him as an essentially honourable figure. Riel nevertheless presents an enigma, although as historian [[J.M.S. Careless]] has observed, it is possible that Riel was both a murderer and a hero. It is also possible that his rash decision to execute Scott drastically altered the history of his people. For example, shortly after the Red River Rebellion the Canadian government began a programme that speculators and other non-M<U+00E9>tis exploited to dispossess the M<U+00E9>tis of their land; had Scott not been executed, the government might well have supervised the program more rigorously, given the prior good relations between Canada and the M<U+00E9>tis. M<U+00E9>tis scholars have noted that Riel is a more important figure to non-M<U+00E9>tis than to M<U+00E9>tis, perhaps because he is often the only M<U+00E9>tis figure most non-M<U+00E9>tis are aware of. Scholars such as [[Thomas Flanagan (political scientist)|Thomas Flanagan]] have pointed out certain parallels between Riel's following during the North-West Rebellion and [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] [[cult]]s. Others have embraced his image as a revolutionary<U+2014>in the 1960s, the Quebec terrorist group, the [[Front de lib<U+00E9>ration du Qu<U+00E9>bec]], went so far as to adopt the name "Louis Riel" for one of its [[terrorist cell]]s.

An act to revoke the conviction of Louis Riel was introduced to the House of Commons, however the motion lacked unanimous consent from the House and was dropped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/riel/revokeconv.html|title=Act to revoke the conviction of Louis Riel}}</ref>

It was unveiled in 1970 and stood on the grounds of the [[Legislative Assembly of Manitoba]] for 23 years. After much outcry (especially from the M<U+00E9>tis community) that the statue was an undignified misrepresentation, the statue was removed and placed at the [[Coll<U+00E8>ge universitaire de Saint-Boniface]]. It was replaced in 1994 with a statue designed by [[Miguel Joyal]] depicting Riel as a dignified statesman. A statue of Riel on the grounds of the Saskatchewan legislative building in Regina was installed and later removed for similar reasons.

In numerous communities in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and even in Ontario, Riel is commemorated in the names of streets, schools, and other buildings (such as the Louis Riel School Division in Winnipeg). The student centre and campus pub at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in Saskatoon are named after Riel.<ref>{{cite web

On [[September 25]], [[2007]], it was announced that Manitoba is likely to establish a statutory holiday on the third Monday in February as [[Louis Riel Day]], beginning in 2008. The act was passed September 26, 2007 in the Manitoba legislature.<ref>{{cite news |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Manitoba's new holiday: Louis Riel Day Day|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2007/09/25/stat-holiday.html |work= |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=2007-09-25 |accessdate= 2007-09-25 }}</ref>

An [[opera]] about Riel entitled ''Louis Riel'' was commissioned for [[Canadian Centennial|Canada's centennial]] celebrations in 1967. It was an opera in three acts, written by [[Harry Somers]], with an English and French [[libretto]] by [[Mavor Moore]] and [[Jacques Languirand]]. The [[Canadian Opera Company]] produced and performed the first run of the opera in September and October, 1967.<ref>{{cite web

From the late 1960s until the early 1990s, the city of [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Saskatoon]] hosted "Louis Riel Day", a summer celebration that included a relay race that combined running, backpack carrying, [[canoeing]], hill climbing, and [[horseback riding]] along the [[South Saskatchewan River]] in the city's downtown core. Traditionally, the event also included a [[cabbage roll]] eating contest and [[tug-of-war]] competition, as well as live musical performances. Although not affiliated with the Saskatoon Exhibition, for years Louis Riel Day was scheduled for the day prior to the start of the fair, and as such came to be considered the Exhibition's unofficial kick-off (the scheduling of the two events was separated in later years). The event was discontinued when major sponsors pulled out.

In 1994 a Canadian [[rock band]] adopted the name [[Exovedate (band)|Exovedate]], the name given by Riel to his council in 1885. [[Billy Childish]] wrote a song entitled "Louis Riel", which has been performed by [[Thee Headcoats]], [[Thee Headcoatees]] and [[Blackhands]].

On [[October 22]], [[2003]], the Canadian news channel [[CBC Newsworld]] and its French-language equivalent, [[R<U+00E9>seau de l'information]], staged a simulated retrial of Riel. Viewers were invited to enter a verdict on the trial over the internet, and more than 10,000 votes were received<U+2014>87% of which were "not guilty". The results of this straw poll led to renewed calls for Riel's posthumous [[pardon]]. Also on the basis of a public poll, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC's]] ''[[The Greatest Canadian|Greatest Canadian]]'' project ranked Riel as the 11th "Greatest Canadian".

In 2006, the [[CBC Radio]] program ''[[As It Happens]]'' aired a piece on a lost poem written by Riel very shortly before his death.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radioshows/AS_IT_HAPPENS/20061116.shtml|title=CBC Radio Show Program Logs<U+2014>November 16, 2006|accessdate= 2007-09-28 }}</ref>
