'''Gnawa music''' is a mixture of  [[Africa]]n, [[Berber]], and [[Arab|Arabic]] religious songs and rhythms. It combines music and [[acrobatic]] dancing. The music is both a prayer and a celebration of life. Though much of the influences that formed this music can be traced back to [[sub-Sahara]]n Africa, and specifically, the Western [[sahel]], it is mainly concentrated in [[north Africa]], mainly [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]]. (See [[Gnawa]] for more details)

==Music==
[[Image:InstrumentsG.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The 3 main instruments (from left to right): "Krakebs", "Tbel", and "Guembri"]]

In a Gnawa song, one phrase or a few lines are repeated over and over throughout a particular song though the song may last a long time. In fact, a song may last several hours non-stop. 

The melodic language of the stringed instrument is closely related to their vocal music and to their speech patterns, as is the case in much [[African music]]. It is a language that emphasizes on the tonic and fifth, with quavering pitch-play, especially pitch-flattening, around the third, the fifth, and sometimes the seventh. This is the language of the [[blues]]. 

Gnawas have venerable stringed-instrument traditions involving both bowed [[lute]]s like the gogo and plucked lutes like the ''guembri'' <U+0686><U+0645><U+0628><U+0631><U+064A> (also called ''hag'houge'' <U+0647><U+062C><U+0647><U+0648><U+0647>) (a three-stringed bass instrument). The Gnawas also use large drums called ''tbel'' (Arabic: <U+0637><U+0628><U+0644> ) and ''[[krakebs]]'' (large iron castanets; Arabic:  <U+0642><U+0631><U+0627><U+0642><U+0628>) in their ritual music. The gnawa hag'houge has strong historical and musical links to West African lutes like the Hausa halam, a direct ancestor of the [[banjo]]. 

Gnawa ''hag'houge'' players use a technique which [[19th century]] [[United States|American]] [[minstrel]] [[banjo]] instruction manuals identify as "brushless drop-thumb frailing". The "brushless" part means the fingers do not brush several [[Vibrating cord|strings]] at once to make [[Chord (music)|chords]]. Instead, the thumb drops repeatedly in a hypnotically rhythmic pattern against the freely-vibrating bass string producing a throbbing drone, while the first two or three fingers of the same (right) hand pick out, often percussive patterns in a drum-like, almost telegraphic manner.

==Rituals==
[[Image:Gnawa6.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Performing a "Lila"]]
Gnawas perform a complex liturgy, called ''lila'' or ''derdeba''. The ceremony recreates the first sacrifice and the genesis of the universe by the evocation of the seven main manifestations of the divine demiurgic activity. It calls the seven saints and supernatural entities (''mluk'', Arabic: <U+0645><U+0644><U+0648><U+0643>) represented by seven colors, as a prismatic decomposition of the original light/energy. The ''derdeba'' is jointly animated by a ''ma<U+00E2>lem'' (the master musician) at the head of his troop and by woman-conspicuous who is in charge of the accessories and clothing necessary to the ritual.

During the ceremony, the conspicuous one governs the accessories and clothing ritual necessary.  On the other hand, the ''ma<U+00E2>lem'', using the ''guembri'' and by burning [[incense]], calls the [[Saint|saints]] and the [[supernatural]] entities to present themselves in order to take possession of the followers who will devote themselves to fright.

Inside the brotherhood, each group (''zriba''; Arabic: <U+0632><U+0631><U+064A><U+0628><U+0629>) gets together with an initiation (''moqadma''; Arabic: <U+0645><U+0642><U+062F><U+0645><U+0629>), the priestess that leads the ecstatic dance called the ''jedba'' (Arabic: <U+062C><U+062F><U+0628><U+0629>), and with the ''ma<U+00E2>lem'', the master of the ''guembri'', who is accompanied by several players of ''krakebs''.

Preceded by an animal sacrifice, that assures the maintenance of the presents, the night-ritual starts with the opening and the consecration of the space, the ''a<U+00E2>da'' ( "habit" or traditional form; Arabic: <U+0639><U+0627><U+062F><U+0629>), when the gnawa musicians perform a swirling acrobatic dance, playing the ''krakebs''. 

The ''mluk'' (''melk'' in its singular form) are abstract entities that gather a number of similar ''[[jinn]]'' (genie spirits). The participants enter a trance state (''jedba'') in which they may perform spectacular dances. It is by means of these dances that participants negotiate their relationships with the ''mluk'' either placating them if they have been offended or strengthening an existing relationship.  The ''mluk'' are evoked by seven musical patterns, seven melodic and rhythmic cells, who set up the seven suites that form the repertoire of dance and music of the gnawa ritual. During these seven suites, are burned seven different types of incense and the dancers are covered by veils of seven different colours. 

Each one of the seven ''mluk'' is accompanied by many "characters" identifiable by the music and by the footsteps of the dance. Each '''mluk''' is accompanied by its specific colour, incense, rhythm and dance. These entities, treated like "presences" (called ''hadra'', Arabic: <U+062D><U+0636><U+0631><U+0629>) that the consciousness meets in the ecstatic space and time, are related with mental complexes, human characters and behaviors. The aim of the ritual is to reintegrate and to balance the main powers of the [[human body]], made by the same energy that supports the perceptible phenomenons and the divine creative activity.
  
Later, the ''guembri'' opens the ''treq'' ("path," Arabic: <U+0637><U+0631><U+064A><U+0642>), the strictly encoded sequence of the ritual repertoire of music, dances, colors and incenses, that guide in the ecstatic trip across the realms of the seven mluk, until the renaissance in the common world, at the first lights of dawn. 

Almost all Moroccan brotherhoods, such as the [[Issawas]] or the [[Hmatchas]], relate their spiritual authority to a saint. The ceremonies begin by reciting that saint's written works or spiritual prescriptions (''hizb'', Arabic: <U+062D><U+0632><U+0628>) in Arabic. In this way, they assert their role as the spiritual descendants of the founder, giving themselves the authority to perform the ritual. Gnawa, whose ancestors were neither literate nor speakers of Arabic, begin the ''lila'' by bringing back, through song and dance their origins, the experiences of their slave ancestors, and ultimately redemption.

==Gnawa music today==

During the last few decades, gnawa music has been modernizing itself and thus becoming more profane. However, there are still many ''lilas'' organized privately and thus conserving its stautus of being a spiritual music.

Within the framework of the [[Gnaoua World Music Festival]] of [[Essaouira]] ("Gnaoua and Musiques of the World"), the gnawas play in a profane context where there is no more religious or therapeutic dimension. The art is brought back to the musical expression of their culture which they share with other musicians coming from the four corners of the world.

With that, gnawa music is taking a new dimension by fusing its core spiritual music with similar genres like [[jazz]], blues, [[reggae]], [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]]. Every summer (4 days in June), the Festival welcomes famous musicians that come to participate, exchange and mix their own music with the gnawa music creating one of the best jam sessions on the planet. Since its debut in [[1998]], and entirely free to the public, the audience of the festival has grown from 20,000 visitors to 200,000 in [[2004]] including 10,000 visitors from around the world. 

Past participants have included [[Randy Weston]], [[Adam Rudolph]], The Wailers, [[Pharoah Sanders]], [[Keziah Jones]], [[Omar Sosa]], [[Doudou N'Diaye Rose]], and the [[Italy|Italian]] trumpet player [[Paolo Fresu]].

There are also projects like "The Sudani Project" which is a jazz/gnawa dialogue activated in the collaboration of saxophonist/composer Patrick Brennan, Gnawi ma<U+00E2>lem Najib Sudani, and drummer/percussionist/vocalist Nirankar Khalsa. "The ''krakebs'' and the ''guembri'', being metal and gut bass strings, are parallels to the [[cymbal]] and bass in the [[jazz]] sound. I liked the kind of [[polyrhythmic]] relationship between them, and that's part of what I began to incorporate into my own writing, multilevelled rhythm being one of my favorite orchestral preoccupations. And, the gnawa "bass" is so melodic and up front," Brennan commented.

Since a few years, new young musicians, from different backgrounds and nationalities, started to form modern gnawa bands. "Gnawa Diffusion" from France and "Gnawa Impulse" from Germany are examples. They offer a rich mix of musical and cultural backgrounds, fusing their individual influences into a collective sound. They have woven elements of [[rapping|rap]], reggae, jazz and [[Ra<U+00EF>|rai]] into a vibrant musical patchwork.
