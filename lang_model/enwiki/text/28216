A '''shooter''' (or '''shot''') is a one- to four-ounce [[alcoholic beverage]]. It may consist of one type of [[alcohol]] or a [[cocktail]] of different alcohols, often mixed with other beverages. Shooters can be shaken, stirred, blended, layered, or simply poured. [[Shot glass]]es or [[sherry glass]]es are the usual [[drinkware]] from which shooters are served.

A shooter is most commonly served at a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]. Some [[bartender]]s may have their own signature shooter. Shooters, like most cocktails, may vary in their ingredients from bartender to bartender, and from region to region. Two creations may share the same name, but taste very different from each other due to differences in how the drink is prepared. Shooters are often drunk quickly and with groups of people while celebrating.

The names of shooters are quite varied and may incorporate [[vulgar]]ities for shock value (e.g., ''[[Cocksucking Cowboy]]'') and word of mouth exposure. Names are commonly drawn from [[Popular culture|pop culture]], [[Brand|brand names]] (e.g., ''Galliano Hot Shot''), [[people]], [[history]] (e.g., ''[[Carbomb (beer mix)|Irish Car Bomb]]''), taste (e.g., ''[[Cement mixer]]''), or perceived effect (e.g., ''[[Snakebite (beer cocktail)|Snake Bite]]'').

Another type of shooter uses a lowball glass and a shot glass. The shot glass is placed inside the lowball and each are filled. The center shot typically holds the 'stronger' of the two beverages. Disposable Bomb Cups have become popular. These plastic disposable cups have built-in shot glasses in the center. Examples of shots poured in this type of cup: Jag-Bomb; Ricky Bobby.
