'''Albert Alexander Murphree''' (April 29, 1870 &ndash; December 20, 1927) was an American university professor and administrator.  Murphree was a native of [[Alabama]], and became a mathematics instructor after earning his bachelor's degree.  He later served as the third president of Florida State College (later renamed [[Florida State University]]) located in [[Tallahassee, Florida]], from 1897 to 1909, and the second president of the [[University of Florida]] located in [[Gainesville, Florida]], from 1909 to 1927.  Murphree is the only person to have been the president of both of Florida's major state universities, the University of Florida<ref>The [[University of Florida]] was first known as the "University of the State of Florida," and its creation was the result of the 1905 consolidation of four predecessor institutions, including the [[History of the University of Florida|University of Florida at Lake City]] (formerly known as Florida Agricultural College until 1903), the [[History of the University of Florida|East Florida Seminary]] in Gainesville, the [[History of the University of Florida|St. Petersburg Normal and Industrial School]], and the [[History of the University of Florida|South Florida Military College]] in Bartow.  The school's official name was shortened to the "University of Florida" in 1909.</ref> and Florida State University,<ref>[[Florida State University]] was first known as the [[History of Florida State University|West Florida Seminary]] from its founding until 1901, then as [[History of Florida State University|Florida State College]] from 1901 to 1905, as the [[History of Florida State University|Florida Female College]] from 1905 to 1909, and from 1909 to 1947 as the [[History of Florida State University|Florida State College for Women]].  Adding to the confusing succession of names, the [[Florida Legislature]] granted the West Florida Seminary the right to call itself the "University of Florida" from 1885 to 1903, although it is unclear how widely used this title was, given that the school continued to call itself the West Florida Seminary and then Florida State College throughout this period.  Aspiring to refashion Florida Agricultural College into a more comprehensive university, the legislature renamed it the "University of Florida," a name which it used exclusively from 1903 to 1905.  As a result of the Buckman Act, Florida Agricultural College was abolished and its academic programs merged into the new University of the State of Florida in 1905.</ref> and he played an important role in the consolidation, growth and ultimate success of both institutions.

== Early life and education ==

Murphree was born near Chepultepec, Alabama in 1870.<ref name=armstrong2022>Orland Kay Armstrong, [http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/ufdc/?m=hd15J&i=76093  ''The Life and Work of Dr. A.A. Murphree''], The Record Company, St. Augustine, Florida, pp. 20&ndash;22 (1928).  Retrieved February 14, 2010.</ref>  His father was Jesee Ellis Murphree, a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] veteran; his mother was Emily Helen Cornelius.<ref>Armstrong, ''Life and Work'', p. 19.</ref>  His parents raised him in a family of ten children in [[Walnut Grove, Alabama]], where he attended community schools and a local two-year college.<ref>Armstrong, ''Life and Work'', pp. 20&ndash;23.</ref>  He graduated from the [[University of Nashville]] with a bachelor's degree in 1894,<ref>Armstrong, ''Life and Work'', p. 23.  Early biographies of Murphree and early histories of the University of Florida often refer to Murphree as "Dr. Murphree," and he was apparently addressed as such by his later students.  The highest academic degree he completed was a master's, but [[Rollins College]] and the [[University of Alabama]] conferred upon him honorary doctor of laws degrees.</ref> and taught mathematics at several high schools and small colleges in Alabama, Tennessee and Texas.<ref>Armstrong, ''Life and Work'', pp. 23&ndash;24.</ref>  In 1895, he became a mathematics instructor at the [[History of Florida State University|West Florida Seminary]] (now known as Florida State University) in Tallahassee, Florida,<ref>Armstrong, ''Life and Work'', p. 25.</ref> and two years later, its board of trustees appointed him as the seminary's third president in 1897, at the age of 27.<ref>Armstrong, ''Life and Work'', p. 27.</ref>  Later, Murphree married Jennie Henderson, the daughter of one of the seminary's trustees.<ref>Armstrong, ''Life and Work'', pp. 26&ndash;27.</ref>  He subsequently started and completed the academic work for a [[master's degree]] while serving as president of the seminary.

== Professor and university president ==

In 1905, several prominent political backers advanced Murphree's name to be the first president of the new [[University of Florida|University of the State of Florida]], which was the newly consolidated men's university and [[land-grant college]] created by the [[Florida Legislature]]'s passage of the [[Henry Holland Buckman|Buckman Act]].  Instead, the [[Florida Board of Control]] selected [[Andrew Sledd]], then the president of the [[History of the University of Florida|University of Florida in Lake City]], to be the first president of the new men's university.  Murphree continued to serve as the president of Florida State College, which became the all-female Florida Female College under the Buckman Act.  From 1905 to 1909, Murphree emphasized greater academic expectations for his female students, while upgrading and expanding the college's [[curriculum]] to meet modern university standards.<ref>Florida State University, [http://ocean.fsu.edu/~nancy/lawton/history.htm  Florida State University&ndash;&ndash;Women and Science at FSU].  Retrieved on July 2, 2007.</ref>  In 1909, Murphree convinced the legislature to change the name of the college to the Florida State College for Women.

When the first president of the University of Florida, Andrew Sledd, was not re-appointed for the 1909&ndash;1910 school year because of a conflict over what some political figures believed were inflexible admissions standards that were impeding the growth of the university, Murphree's name was once again advanced as a replacement.<ref>Carl Van Ness, "Florida's Sledd Affair: Andrew Sledd and the Fight for Higher Education in Florida," ''Florida Historical Quarterly'', vol. 87, no. 3, pp. 343&ndash;351 (2009).</ref>  This time, the Board of Control voted unanimously to approve his appointment.<ref>Van Ness, "Florida's Sledd Affair," p. 348.</ref>  Murphree assumed his new duties during the summer of 1909, and worked diligently with his predecessor to ensure a smooth transition that capitalized on previous successes.<ref>Van Ness, "Florida's Sledd Affair," pp. 349&ndash;350.</ref>  In a surprise to some of his previous political supporters, Murphree endorsed Sledd's admissions standards, and thereafter actually tightened the requirements for entry again in 1912.<ref>Van Ness, "Florida's Sledd Affair," p. 350.  Murphree wrote to the ''[[Savannah Morning News]]'', "I shall not cater to the peoples' whim for numbers, but shall maintain the same high standards of scholarship upheld by Dr. Sledd and his able faculty."  He also subsequently retained the entire faculty selected by his predecessor.</ref>

Beginning in 1910, Murphree reorganized the university's administration into four academic colleges: the [[University of Florida College of Liberal Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]], the [[University of Florida College of Law|College of Law]], the [[University of Florida College of Agricultural and Life Sciences|College of Agriculture]], and the [[University of Florida College of Engineering|College of Engineering]], as well as the Graduate School.<ref name=pastpresidents>University of Florida, Past Presidents, [http://www.president.ufl.edu/pastPres/murphree.htm  Albert A. Murphree (1909&ndash;1927)].  Retrieved February 14, 2010.</ref>  Murphree took particular interest in the "School of Graduate Studies," and the university awarded its first master's degree in 1910.<ref>Armstrong, ''Life and Work'', p. 52.  Retrieved February 14, 2010.</ref>  He later oversaw the addition of the [[University of Florida College of Education|College of Education]] in 1912, the [[University of Florida College of Pharmacy|School of Pharmacy]] in 1924, the [[University of Florida College of Design, Construction and Planning|School of Architecture]] in 1925, and the [[Warrington College of Business|College of Commerce and Journalism]] in 1927.<ref>Armstrong, ''Life and Work'', pp. 51, 74&ndash;75.</ref>  During Murphree's term, he oversaw the construction of ten new major buildings, including such historical landmarks as [[Flint Hall (Gainesville, Florida)|Flint Hall]] (Science Department), [[Floyd Hall (Gainesville, Florida)|Floyd Hall]] (College of Agriculture), [[Peabody Hall (Gainesville, Florida)|Peabody Hall]] (College of Education), the [[University Auditorium (Gainesville, Florida)|University Auditorium]], and the new University Library (now known as [[Library East (Gainesville, Florida)|Smathers Library East]]).<ref>Armstrong, ''Life and Work'', p. 51.</ref>  The University of Florida's enrollment grew from 186 students in 1909 to over 2,000 in 1927.<ref name=armstrong12>Armstrong, ''Life and Work'', p. 12.</ref>

Murphree is reported to have taken pride in knowing every Florida student by name.<ref name=floridafoundation>University of Florida Foundation, Named UF Facilities, [http://www.uff.ufl.edu/Facilities/facilities.asp?id=4  Albert A. Murphree Hall].  Retrieved February 14, 2010.</ref>  Under Murphree, student leaders formed the [[Florida Blue Key]] leadership society in 1923, the university celebrated its first [[homecoming]] parade in 1924, and students organized the first [[Gator Growl]] pep rally and variety show in 1925.<ref>Julian M. Pleasants, ''Gator Tales: An Oral History of the University of Florida'', University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, p. 26 (2006).</ref>

While president of Florida, Murphree became a friend of [[William Jennings Bryan]], the former congressman from [[Nebraska]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominee for President in 1896, 1900 and 1908.<ref name=proctorbryan2-3>Samuel Proctor, "[http://fulltext6.fcla.edu/DLData/CF/CF00000039/CF00154113/39_1/39no1.pdf  William Jennings Bryan and the University of Florida]," ''Florida Historical Quarterly'', vol. 39, pp. 2&ndash;3 (1960).</ref>  Bryan established a winter residence in [[Miami, Florida]] in 1912, and became a full-time Florida resident in 1921.<ref>Proctor, "William Jennings Bryan," p. 1.</ref>  Bryan was a frequent speaker throughout Florida, and first met Murphree at a speech at the university in 1916.<ref name=proctorbryan2-3/>  As a result of his friendship with Murphree, Bryan volunteered to be the fund-raising drive chairman for the construction of the university's new Florida Union building (now known as [[Dauer Hall]]).<ref>Proctor, "William Jennings Bryan," pp. 4&ndash;8.</ref>

Murphree's name was floated as a possible gubernatorial candidate on several occasions, but he disavowed any interest in elected office.<ref name=armstrong15>Armstrong, ''Life and Work'', p. 15.</ref>  Without consulting Murphree in advance, on January 13, 1924, William Jennings Bryan announced his candidacy to be a delegate to the 1924 [[Democratic National Convention]], where, if elected, he would nominate Murphree as the party's candidate for [[President of the United States]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1924|1924 election]].<ref name=proctorbryan12>Proctor, "William Jennings Bryan," p. 12.</ref>  Bryan campaigned vigorously despite Murphree's steadfast refusal to do so as a candidate.<ref name=proctorbryan1214>Proctor, "William Jennings Bryan," pp. 12&ndash;14.</ref>   Murphree stated that he was flattered by Bryan's effort, but "Nobody expects a [[Southern United States|Southern]] man to be nominated President, much less a Florida man."<ref name=armstrong15/>  Florida newspapers urged Murphree to run, but few others took his candidacy seriously.<ref name=proctorbryan1214/>  Bryan was elected as a delegate to the Democratic Convention, pledged to support Murphree's nomination, but Bryan was greeted by boos and jeers at the convention because of his nomination of Murphree.<ref name=proctorbryan14>Proctor, "William Jennings Bryan," p. 14.</ref>  Bryan later told Senator [[J. Thomas Heflin]] that his reception by his fellow convention delegates was the most humiliating of his life.<ref name=proctorbryan14/>

Murphree was elected president of the [[Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities|National Association of State Universities]] in 1927.<ref name=armstrong12/>

== Death and legacy ==

Murphree died unexpectedly in his sleep, at the age of 57, in Gainesville on December 20, 1927.<ref name=armstrong1314>Armstrong, ''Life and Work'', pp. 13&ndash;14.</ref>  His wife Jennie had died four years earlier.<ref>Armstrong, ''Life and Work'', p. 14.</ref>  Murphree and his wife were survived by four children&ndash;&ndash;two sons, John A.H.

Murphree, who was the second choice to be the first president of the University of Florida, served longer as the second leader of the university than all but one of its other ten presidents.<ref>Pleasants, ''Gator Tales'', pp. 14, 27, 34.  The third president, [[John J. Tigert]], served for nineteen years, one year longer than Murphree.</ref>  While he was not the founding president, Murphree built upon the solid academic standards, faculty choices and planning of his predecessor, Andrew Sledd, and greatly expanded and improved upon them; he imposed the university's modern organizational structure and was responsible for the beginnings of many of its traditions.<ref>Pleasants, ''Gator Tales'', pp. 14&ndash;27.</ref>

After his death, Murphree was widely praised on the editorial pages of newspapers throughout the state and region.<ref name=armstrong161172>''See, generally'', Armstrong, ''Life and Work'', pp. 161&ndash;172.</ref>  He was credited with helping the University of Florida grow from a small state college into a rapidly expanding regional university in his eighteen years as its president.<ref name=armstrong161172/>

The two universities that Murphree nurtured in their infancy continued to grow and prosper after his death.  In 2008, Florida State University had a total enrollment of over 41,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional students; the University of Florida enrolled over 51,000 total students.  In a little over one hundred years, the two national research universities, in whose early expansion and improvement Murphree had played a fundamental role, had grown to take their places among the twenty largest single-campus universities in the [[United States]], the University of Florida among the five largest.<ref name=aboutuf>University of Florida, [http://www.ufl.edu/aboutUF/  About UF].
