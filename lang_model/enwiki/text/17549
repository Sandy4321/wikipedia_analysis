|'''Makruk''', starting position.
}}
'''Makruk''' (thai <U+0E2B><U+0E21><U+0E32><U+0E01><U+0E23><U+0E38><U+0E01>) (or '''Thai chess''') is a [[board game]] descended from the [[6th century]] [[India]]n game of [[chaturanga]] or a close relative thereof, and therefore related to [[chess]]. It is regarded as the most similar living game to this common ancestor of all chess variants.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Harold James Ruthven Murray|Murray, H.J.R.]] | title=[[A History of Chess]]

The name ''makruk'' is expressed with a low-shaking tone while saying ''mak'' and a high-level tone when saying ''ruk''. Makruk is popular in [[Thailand]] and [[Cambodia]]. In these countries the game is more popular than chess. There are around two million [[Thai people|Thais]] who can play Makruk, of which about 5000 also play chess.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[David Pritchard (chess writer)|Pritchard, D.]] | title=Popular Chess Variants

According to [[Vladimir Kramnik]], ''Makruk Thai is more strategic than international chess. You have to plan your operations with total care since Makruk Thai can be compared to an anticipated endgame of International Chess.''<ref>[http://www.chessvariants.org/oriental.dir/thaikramnik.html Kramnik plays Makruk Thai] by Dr. Ren<U+00E9> Gralla.</ref>

== Rules ==

=== Pieces ===
* The Pawn (called ''biia'', a cowrie shell formerly used for money - thai <U+0E40><U+0E1A><U+0E35><U+0E49><U+0E22>) moves and captures like a pawn in chess, but cannot move two steps on the first move and cannot capture [[en passant]].  A pawn that reaches the 6th rank is always promoted to a queen (met).
* The Rook (called ''reuua'', boat - thai <U+0E40><U+0E23><U+0E37><U+0E2D>) moves like a rook in Western chess: any number of steps horizontally or vertically.
* The Knight (called ''maa'', horse - thai <U+0E21><U+0E49><U+0E32>) moves like a knight in Western chess: 2 steps in one direction and then 1 step perpendicular to that movement. It jumps over any pieces in the way.
* The Bishop (called ''khohn'' - thai <U+0E42><U+0E04><U+0E19>) moves one step in any diagonal direction or one step forward (like the [[Shogi#Silver general|silver general]] in [[Shogi]]).
* The Queen (called ''met'' or minister <U+0E40><U+0E21><U+0E47><U+0E14>) moves one step in any diagonal direction (as the ''Fers'' in [[Shatranj]]).
* The King (called ''khoon'', the lowest rank of the ancient Thai civil nobility - thai <U+0E02><U+0E38><U+0E19>) moves like a king in Western chess - 1 step in any direction.  The game ends when the king is checkmated.

In starting position, pawns are placed on the 3rd and 6th ranks. Queens are placed at the right side of Kings. Pawns promote to Queens when they  reach the 6th rank. There is no castling, as in Western chess.

=== Counting rules ===

When neither side has any pawns the game must be completed within a certain number of moves or it is declared a draw. When a piece is captured the count starts again from scratch only if it is the last piece of one side in the game.<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:cambodian_chess.jpg|right|framed|Cambodian chess being played on a Phnom Penh street]] -->

* When neither side has any pawns left, mate must be achieved in 64 moves. The disadvantaged player does the counting, and may at any time choose to stop counting. If the disadvantaged side checkmates the advantage side and did not stop counting, the game is declared a draw.

When the last piece (that is not the King) of the disadvantaged side is captured, the count is restarted and the stronger side is now given a count value based on the pieces it has left: 

* At least two rooks: 8 moves
* At least one rook: 16 moves
* At least two bishops: 22 moves
* At least two knights: 32 moves
* At least one bishop: 44 moves
* At least one knight: 64 moves
* Only queens left: 64 moves

From these starting values, subtract 1 for each piece on the board. The resulting number is how many moves the stronger side has to win, otherwise the game becomes a draw. Once the players have reached this point, the count does not restart unless one side had stopped counting and would like to start counting again.

For example, if white has two rooks and a knight against a lone black king, he has 3 moves to checkmate his opponent (the given value of 8 minus the total number of pieces, 5). If black captures a white rook, the ''count does not restart''. Many players don't understand the rules and would restart.
