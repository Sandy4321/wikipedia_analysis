==History==

===Origin===
Compass Group has its origins in a company which was founded by Jack Bateman in 1941 as ''Factory Canteens Limited'' and which subsequently became known as ''Bateman Catering''.<ref name="caterer">{{cite web|url=http://www.caterersearch.com/Companies/33936/compass-group.html|title=Compass Group Timeline|publisher=Caterer Search|accessdate=9 March 2014}}</ref> Bateman Catering and ''Midland Catering'' were acquired by [[Grand Metropolitan]] in 1967 and 1968 respectively<ref name="caterer"/><ref name=cc83>{{cite web|url=http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1983/fulltext/174c06.pdf |title=Competition Commission Report 1983 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref> and a management buy-out from Grand Metropolitan followed in 1987 when the Compass Group was formed.<ref name="caterer" /><ref name=cc83/>

===Public listing===
Compass Group was first listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] in 1988.<ref name="caterer" /> Eurest, one of the company's US subsidiaries, was launched in the [[United States|USA]] in 1996 to provide [[dining]] services to local, regional and national companies within the business and industry markets, including employee dining centers, on-site [[catering]], vending, executive dining rooms, and other managed services.<ref name="compass-usa.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.compass-usa.com|title=Compass USA|accessdate=9 March 2014}}</ref>

===Corporate growth===
Compass Group purchased [[Morrison Management Specialists]] and then merged with [[Granada plc]] as part of a planned strategy to separate the media and catering interests of the latter. The two companies demerged in February 2001 to form Compass plc and [[Granada plc|Granada Media]].<ref name="caterer" /> It had become the world's biggest catering firm by 2005.<ref name="guardian2006"/>

Compass Group then sold its roadside and travel catering businesses for a combined <U+00A3>1.82&nbsp;billion in April 2006 .<ref name="caterer" /> The transaction included the sale of 43 [[Moto Hospitality|Moto]] motorway service areas to Australia's [[Macquarie Bank]] for an estimated <U+00A3>600&nbsp;million.<ref name="caterer" /> Compass's Select Service Partners (SSP) travel concessions business was sold to companies controlled by private equity firm [[EQT Partners]], for an estimated <U+00A3>1.2&nbsp;billion.<ref name="caterer" />

Compass Group PLC made further acquisitions in 2009, including Kimco and Lackmans in the USA, Plural in Germany and the retail franchises for several McColls retail site leases in the UK.<ref name="prelims" />

===Association with UN and Armed Forces===
Compass Group's subsidiary ESS became a UN-registered food vendor in 2000 and then won contracts to supply UN peace-keepers operating in Sudan, East Timor, Liberia, Burundi, Eritrea, Lebanon, Cyprus and Syria.<ref name="guardian2006">{{cite web|author=Add answer |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2006/oct/16/money.internationalnews |title=Compass settles UN catering lawsuits &#124; Business &#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2006-10-16 |accessdate=2013-06-01}}</ref><ref name="guardian2006"/> The company bought [[Morrison Management Specialists]] in 2000 and in July of that year the company merged with [[Granada plc]] as part of a strategy to separate the media and catering interests of the latter. The two companies demerged in February 2001 to form Compass plc and [[Granada plc|Granada Media]].<ref name="caterer" />

ESS was contracted by the U.S. Marine Corps, the 82nd Airborne Division, the British Ministry of Defence, the Coalition Provisional Authority, along with the major defense contractors Fluor, RMS, Bechtel, and most notably [[Kellogg, Brown and Root|KBR]] (a subsidiary of [[Halliburton]]) under the [[U.S. Army]] troop support contract called LOGCAP III to provide dining and construction services at desert bases and encampments in Kuwait.<ref name=waxman>[http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070207112222-87567.pdf Waxman's statement]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref> and Iraq<ref name=waxman/> from the start of operations in 2003 to 2006.<ref name=waxman/>

===Reorganization===
In 2011, Morrison Management Specialist was re-organised into three sectors (Morrison Healthcare, Morrison Senior Living, Touchpoint Support Services). Then in 2013 the Czech branch of Eurest was listed as one of the <U+201C>100 Best Czech Companies<U+201D> in 2013.<ref name="eurest1">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurest.cz/index.php |title=Eurest |publisher=Eurest.cz |date= |accessdate=2013-06-01}}</ref> The company also acquired Integrated Cleaning Management in 2013.<ref name="integratedcleaningmanagement1">{{cite web|url=http://www.integratedcleaningmanagement.com/ |title=Specialist Provider of Cleaning Services: Retail, Leisure, Hotel & Commercial |publisher=Integrated Cleaning Management |date= |accessdate=2013-06-01}}</ref>

==Criticisms of Compass Group==

===2005 United Nations misconduct incident===

ESS became a UN-registered food vendor in 2000 and then went on to win contracts to supply UN peacekeepers operating in Sudan, East Timor, Liberia, Burundi, Eritrea, Lebanon, Cyprus and Syria.<ref name="guardian2006"/>

In 2005, subsidiary [[Eurest Support Services]] won contracts to provide food to UN peacekeepers in [[Liberia]], valued at $237 million.<ref name="guardian2006"/><ref name="fox">{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,184495,00.html |title=UN Procurement Scandal: how far did the inside information travel? |publisher=Fox News |date=10 February 2006 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/un_documents.pdf |title=The stolen secret documents |date= |format=PDF |accessdate=18 April 2011 |work=Fox News}}</ref>

The investigation was conducted by law firm [[Freshfields]] and accountants [[Ernst & Young]] and overseen and ultimately by the chairman of Compass<U+2019> audit committee, Steve Lucas.<ref name="autogenerated2006"/><ref name="seawright2006"/>

The UN suspended Compass in October 2005 after allegations of contract bidding irregularities.

In a separate UN investigation into the [[oil-for-food program]] hand found that Mr Yakovlev was guilty of fraudulent conduct.

After its own <U+00A3>5m,<ref name="guardian2006"/> three-month internal investigation, Compass had declared it had discovered "serious irregularities" in its UN business, but that these were limited to "only a few individuals" who were dismissed: Peter R. Harris,<ref name="guardian2006"/> Andy Seiwert and Doug Kerr.<ref name="fox"/> Mr Harris, who by then was the head of the group's British, Middle East and African division at this point.<ref name="guardian2006"/> While Compass refused to make public its investigation,<ref name="fox"/> CEO [[Michael Bailey (businessman)|Michael Bailey]] stepped down in June 2006. The subsidiary [[Eurest Support Services]] was soon restructured and reformed along a new business model.<ref name="autogenerated2006"/>

The corruption allegations were also referred to the UK's Serious Fraud Office<ref name="autogenerated2006"/> a criminal investigation by US federal prosecutors<ref name="guardian2006"/> and wider investigations into UN procurement by both the Southern District Court of New York, the US Congress and the UN.<ref name="seawright2006"/> Compass had agreed by October 2006 to pay to up to <U+00A3>40m to settle 2 lawsuits brought against it for allegedly bribing a UN official to win catering contracts.<ref name="guardian2006"/> Compass Group did not admit any legal liability and paid a confidential settlement in the region of <U+00A3>40m.<ref name="guardian2006"/>

The chief executive of Compass Group, Richard Cousins, was quoted as saying: "We believe it is in the best interests of the business and shareholders, and good management, to avoid the uncertainties and costs associated with prolonged litigation. My focus is on the future and this settlement is a major step in putting the matter behind us."<ref name="guardian2006"/>

===Canadian Prisons===
The supplier of food to 7 of Ontario's correctional facilities, Eurest Dining Services, informed the Halton Regional Health Department that some samples taken during routine surveillance had tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes on November 21, 2008. Dr. David Williams, Ontario's acting chief medical officer of health later commented on the issue.<ref name="compass-usa.com"/><ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref name="eurest-usa.com"/>
