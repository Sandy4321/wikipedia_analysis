'''Mary Victoria Curzon, Baroness Curzon of Kedleston''', [[Order of the Crown of India|CI]] ([[27 May]] [[1870]] &ndash; [[18 July]] [[1906]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States|American]] [[Peerage|peeress]] who, by virtue of her marriage to [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon of Kedleston]], [[Viceroy of India]], long held the highest political rank gained by any American woman, Vicereine of India.

==In America==
'''Mary Victoria Leiter''' was born in [[Chicago]], the daughter of [[Levi Leiter]], the wealthy co-founder of Field and Leiter [[dry goods]] business and later partner in the [[Marshall Fields]] retail empire. Her family moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] in [[1881]] and entered the exclusive circle of official society there. They lived for several years in the former home of [[James G. Blaine]] on [[Dupont Circle]]. She was taught dancing, singing, music and art at home by tutors and learned [[French language]] from her French governess. A [[Columbia University]] professor taught her history, arithmetic and chemistry. Travel and prolonged residence abroad cultivated her powers of observation and breadth of mental vision at an early age. Her poise and finish made her charming to those with mature and brilliant intellect.
 
Mary was a striking six feet tall presence with a curving figure. She had large grey eyes set in an oval face, glossy chestnut-brown hair drawn back into a loose knot at the nape of her neck, and delicate hands and feet.
 
Her [[Debutante|debut]] was in winter of [[1888]]. She was regarded an equal in beauty and breeding, and frequently the peer in manner and intellect, of daughters of better known and longer established families in eastern U.S. society. Prior to her marriage, her closest friend [[Frances Folsom Cleveland]] was six years her senior and the wife of a much older President [[Grover Cleveland]].<ref>De Courcy Anne (2003) "''The Viceroy's Daughters: The Lives of the Curzon Sisters''", Harper Collins, 464 pages, ISBN 0-06-093557-X, [http://books.google.com/books?id=ju0AEj7kUegC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=peacock+dress+curzon&source=web&ots=vu8c5pA-8E&sig=-5Iu2TjhxTaUTBdWUPwYt5JKCno 61 page Google Abstract](biography) retrieved from Google 3/14/2007</ref>

The U.S. Ambassador to the [[Court of St. James's]], Thomas F. Bayard, introduced Mary to London Society in [[1894]]. She met a young man, [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Curzon]], a 35-year-old [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Member of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] who had been representing Southport District for eight years and was heir to the [[Viscount Scarsdale|Barony of Scarsdale]]. The position he had made for himself through his own talents was of more interest to her however, than his eventual inheritance. The high reputation of his writings on the political questions in the East particularly attracted her admiration.

Mary Leiter and George Curzon were married on [[22 April]] [[1895]] at St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington D.C. by Bishop Talbot assisted by the Rev. Dr. Mackay Smith, the pastor of the church. She played an important role in the reelection of her husband to Parliament that autumn and many thought that his success was due more to the winning smiles and irresistible charm of his wife than to his own speeches. They had 3 daughters, [[Mary Curzon, 2nd Baroness Ravensdale|Mary Irene]] (later [[Lady Ravensdale]]), in [[1896]], [[Lady Cynthia Mosley|Cynthia Blanche]] (first wife of [[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley]]), on [[23 August]] [[1898]], lastly,  [[Alexandra Naldera Curzon|Alexandra Naldera]], on April 20, 1904 (wife of [[Edward Dudley Metcalfe|Edward "Fruity" Metcalfe]], the best friend, best man and equerry of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]]); best known as ''Baba'' Metcalfe.

Her husband accepted the position of [[Viceroy of India]] and was elevated to the [[Peerage of Ireland]] as Baron Curzon of Kedleston in the summer of [[1898]] at age 39. On [[30 December]] they arrived in [[Bombay]] to the greetings of royal salutes and great excitement. She instantly made an impression of beauty and respect that soon spread all over India. They were greeted in [[Calcutta]] a few days later with great enthusiasm. It was estimated that over one hundred thousand people witnessed the magnificent spectacle of their reception at [[Raj Bhavan (West Bengal)|Government House]]. The Indian poet, [[Ram Sharma]] referred to her in his welcome address to Lord Curzon of Kedleston, as:
<center> "''A rose of roses bright<br />
A vision of embodied light.''"</center>
Another declared her to be:

In [[1901]]  the "''Lady Curzon''", a hybrid (''R. macrantha x R. rugosa Rubra'') variety of [[Rosa rugosa]] rose with soft iridescent pink/violet shade 10 [[centimeter|cm]] flowers and a sweet scent, was first raised by Turner.<ref>Pro artists, Roses/Lady Curzon[http://www.proartists.com/roses/A-UUDET%20SIVUT/UUDET%20RUGOSAT-K-M/ladycurzon-pieni.html Roses/Lady Curzon]</ref>
 
In [[1902]] Lord Curzon organized the [[Delhi Durbar]] to celebrate the coronation of [[King Edward VII]],  "''the grandest pageant in history''", which created a tremendous sensation. At the state ball Mary wore an extravagant coronation gown, by the [[House of Worth]] of [[Paris]], known as the [[peacock]] dress, stitched of gold cloth embroidered with peacock feathers with an emerald in each eye and many precious and semi-precious stones sewn into the fabric. The skirt was trimmed with white roses and the bodice with lace. She glittered with diamonds, pearls and precious stones: a huge diamond necklace and a large broach of diamonds and pearls. She wore a tiara crown with a pearl tipping each of it's high diamond points. As she walked through the hall the crowd was breathless.<ref>Time Magazine, "''Curzon's Will"'', Monday, Aug. 03, 1925[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,720617,00.html?promoid=googlep]</ref><ref>Finding Aids to Official Records of the Smithsonian Institution, Accession 87-156, National Portrait Gallery, Office of Exhibitions, Exhibition Records, 1975-1979 , Mary, Lady Curzon: Portrait of Mary Victoria Leiter, Baroness Curzon of Kedelston (Lady A.

Lord and Lady Curzon were loudly criticised for the huge expense of this extravagant event and their own personal lifestyle, but their defenders pointed out that no money went out of the country. It all came out of
the pockets of the rich and was paid into the hands of the poor. What the government and the native princes and nobles expended in their splendid displays was paid to working people who needed it, and by throwing this large amount into circulation the entire country was benefited.
 
Lady Curzon designed the exquisetly rich and beautiful coronation robe of [[Queen Alexandra]] of England,  from gold fabric woven and embroidered in the same factory in [[Chandni Chauk]] Delhi where she ordered all the
material for her own state gowns. The factory owner said that she had the rarest taste of any woman he knew, and that she was the best dressed woman in the world--an opinion shared by other good judges.

Lady Curzon was an invaluable commercial agent for the manufacturers of the higher class of fabrics and art objects in India. She made many of them fashionable in Calcutta and other Indian cities and in London, Paris and the capitals of Europe. She placed orders for her friends and strangers. She assisted the silk weavers, embroiderers and other artists to adapt their designs, patterns and fabrics to the requirements of modern
fashions. She wore Indian fabrics. She kept several of the best artists in India busy with orders and soon saw the results of her efforts revive skilled arts that were almost forgotten.

Lady curzon was tutored in [[Urdu language|Urdu]] by the [[Mohyal]] patriarch Bakhshi Ram Dass Chhibber.<ref>General Mohyal Sabha, 2005-06, A-9, Qutab Institutional Area, New Delhi-110067, "''MEMBERS OF MOHYALS''"

Progressive medical reforms were initiated by English women in India under the leadership of the [[Hariot Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava|Marchioness of Dufferin]] and Lady Curzon by supplying women doctors and hospitals for women. There is a Lady Curzon Hospital in [[Bangalore]].

On 04 November [[1902]] Lady Curzon wrote from Viceroy's Camp, Simla to [[Lady Randolph Churchill]] advising her on the appropriate headgear to wear in Delhi, saying that she is looking forward to seeing her and that she will not need an ayah in addition to her maid.<ref>Churchill College, CHURCHILL ARCHIVES CENTRE, CHAR 28/66/36 retrieved 3/23/2007[http://www-archives.chu.cam.ac.uk/perl/search?text=%22lady+curzon%22&text_class=smart&text_kw0_sel=UKAT%3A%3APersonnel&text_kw0_must=on&text_kw1_sel=&text_kw1_must=on&text_kw2_sel=&text_kw2_must=on&text_kw3_sel=&text_kw3_must=on&text_kw4_sel=&text_kw4_must=on&start_date_day=&start_date_month=&start_date_year=&end_date_day=&end_date_month=&end_date_year=&Submit=Submit]</ref>  

In [[1903]] she sailed on a yacht from [[Karachi]] for a tour of the [[Persian Gulf]] with Lord Curzon, [[Ignatius Valentine Chirol]], young [[Winston Churchill]] and other notable guests.
  
In 1904, Lady Curzon traveled by train with Lord Curzon to [[Dhaka]] and toured the [[Shahbagh]] area in a fleet of Dechamp Tonneau- model 1902 cars. (photo: Fritz Kapp)

Lady Curzon learned about the [[one-horned rhinoceros|Great One-horned Rhinoceros]] of Kaziranga from her tea-planter friends and wanted to see them. In the winter of [[1904]] she visited the Kaziranga area,<ref>[http://www.kaziranga100.com Kaziranga] accessed on February 23, 2007</ref> and saw some of their [[hoof]] marks but was disappointed not to see any rhinoceros. It was told that the noted [[Assam]]ese animal tracker [[Balaram Hazarika]] showed Lady Curzon around Kaziranga and impressed upon her the urgency of its [[conservation ethic|conservation]].<ref name = "bbc">Subir Bhaumik, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/south_asia/4274927.stm Kaziranga's centenary celebrations], BBC News, South Asia, 18 February, 2005 </ref> Concerned about the dwindling numbers of rhinos, she asked her husband to take necessary action to save the rhinoceros, which he did. The Kaziranga Proposed [[Reserved forests of India|Reserve Forest]] was thus created. This was later developed into the [[Kaziranga National Park]].

Lady Curzon was never able to give Curzon the son and heir he desperately desired. Her demanding social responsibilities, tropical climate, a prolonged near fatal infection following [[miscarriage]], and [[Gynaecology|fertility]]-related [[surgery]] eroded her health. Convalescent trips to England failed to heal her. When they returned to England after Curzon's resignation in August [[1905]], her health was failing. She died July 18, [[1906]] at home in [[Carlton House Terrace|Carlton House Terrace #1]], Westminster, [[London]], 36 years old.<ref>RootsWeb.com, ID: I526875, Mary Victoria Leiter, retrieved 3/17/2007 [http://worldconnect.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=420angel&id=I526875]</ref><ref>Maximilian Genealogy Master Database, Mary Victoria LEITER, 2000[http://www.peterwestern.f9.co.uk/maximilia/pafg1237.htm]</ref>
