{{nihongo|'''Georgia'''|<U+30B8><U+30E7><U+30FC><U+30B8><U+30A2>|J<U+014D>jia}} is the name of a popular brand of [[coffee]]-flavored beverages sold by [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. It was launched in 1975 by Coca-Cola (Japan) Company, a [[Japan]]ese subsidiary of the company. It has since expanded to markets in [[Singapore]], [[India]] and [[Bahrain]]. Georgia enjoys the most success in Japan, where it is the highest-grossing coffee beverage. It is also the highest-grossing beverage by Coca-Cola (Japan) Company. As of 2007, in Japan, Georgia's sales double the sales of [[Coca-Cola]].<ref>[http://www.ccwh.co.jp/pdf/ir/presentation/ccwh/ks_h19q4.pdf Coca-Cola West Japan] IR report (in Japanese), 2007.</ref> Georgia is one of many brands of [[Japanese Canned Coffee]]. Ironically, despite being produced by the [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]-based Coca-Cola company, Georgia coffee is not sold within Georgia. This is due to the fact that there is simply no market for canned coffee in the United States.

Although there are many seasonal blends, Coca-Cola makes Original, Mocha Kilamanjaro, and Emerald Mountain Blend year-round. The coffee can be enjoyed as a cold or hot beverage.

Here is a sample list of the Georgia blends:
* Georgia Coffee Original

In [[PlayStation Home]], the [[PlayStation 3]]'s online community-based service, Coca-Cola has placed a vending machine in Home that takes users to a space called the "Georgia Break Station". The vending machine also distributes original avatar items and presents, along with "C-pons", digital coupons that can be used to get real drinks from real vending machines. This is to promote Coca-Cola's Georgia series of canned coffee. The space is a lounge for users to sit and chat with two in-lounge avatars that talk about the Georgia coffee. It will be available from September 7, 2009 to December 15, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2009/09/06/coca_cola_home/|title=Coca Cola Ties Up with Home|publisher=andriasang.com}}</ref>
