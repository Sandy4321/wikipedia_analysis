'''The Zodiac Killer''' was a [[serial killer]] who operated in [[Northern California]] for ten months in the late [[1960s]].  He coined his name in a series of taunting letters he sent to the press until 1974. His letters included four [[cryptogram]]s or [[ciphers]], three of which have yet to be solved.

The Zodiac murdered five known victims in [[Benicia, California|Benicia]], [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]], [[Lake Berryessa]], and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] between [[December]] [[1968]] and [[October]] [[1969]].  Four men and three women between the ages of 16 and 29 were targeted.  Others have been inconclusively proposed to be Zodiac victims as well.

The killer's identity remains unknown.  The [[San Francisco Police Department]] marked the case "inactive" in [[April]] [[2004]] and reopened it some time before [[March]] [[2007]].  The case remains open in other jurisdictions as well.

== The victims ==
=== Canonical ===
Although the Zodiac claimed in letters to newspapers that he murdered as many as 37 people, investigators agree on only seven [[canonical]] victims, two of whom survived.  They are:

* '''David Arthur Faraday''', 17, and '''Betty Lou Jensen''', 16: Shot and killed on [[December 20]], [[1968]] on Lake Herman Road just within the city limits of [[Benicia, California|Benicia]].
* '''Michael Renault Mageau''', 19, and '''Darlene Elizabeth Ferrin''', 22: Shot on [[July 4]], [[1969]] at Blue Rock Springs Golf Course parking lot on the outskirts of [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]]; Darlene was [[Dead on arrival|DOA]] at Kaiser Foundation Hospital, while Michael survived.
* '''Bryan Calvin Hartnell''', 20, and '''Cecelia Ann Shepard''', 22: Stabbed on [[September 27]], [[1969]] on what is today locally referred to as "Zodiac Island" at [[Lake Berryessa]] in [[Napa County, California|Napa County]]; Hartnell survived six stab wounds to the back, but Shepard died of her injuries two days later at Queen of the Valley Hospital in Napa.<ref>{{cite web | title=Cecelia Ann Shepard and Bryan Calvin Hartnell information at Zodiackiller.com | publisher=ZodiacKiller.com | url=http://zodiackiller.com/ShepardHartnell.html | accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref>
* '''Paul Lee Stine''', 29: Shot and killed on [[October 11]], [[1969]] in [[Presidio Heights]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].

=== Suspected ===
Many others have been identified as potential Zodiac victims, although evidence is inconclusive and none are universally accepted as Zodiac victims. The more well-known suspected victims are:

* '''Robert Domingos''', 18, and '''Linda Edwards''', 17: Shot and killed on [[June 4]], [[1963]], at a beach near [[Lompoc, California]].  Edwards and Domingos were named as possible Zodiac victims due to the specific similarities between their attack and the Zodiac's attack at Lake Berryessa.
* '''Cheri Jo Bates''', 18: Stabbed to death and nearly [[decapitate]]d on [[October 30]], [[1966]], at [[Riverside Community College]] in [[Riverside, California]].  Bates' possible connection to the Zodiac only came to light four years after her murder when ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reporter [[Paul Avery]] received a tip regarding similarities between the Zodiac killings and the circumstances surrounding Bates' death.
* '''Kathleen Johns''', 22: Abducted on [[March 22]], [[1970]], on Highway 132 by I-580, west of [[Modesto, California]].  Johns escaped from the car of a man who drove her and her infant daughter around on the backroads between Stockton and Patterson for some three hours. After escaping to the police station in Patterson, she saw the Zodiac's wanted poster and identified him as her kidnapper.
* '''Donna Lass''', 25: Last seen [[September 26]], [[1970]], in [[South Lake Tahoe, California]].  A  [[postcard]] with an ad from Forest Pines condominiums (near Incline Village at Lake Tahoe) pasted on the back was received at the ''Chronicle'' on [[March 22]], [[1971]], and has been interpreted by some as the Zodiac claiming Lass' disappearance as a victim, despite an incorrect count (in his [[July 26]] [[1970]] letter, the Zodiac was already claiming 13 victims; Lass should have been the fourteenth, not the twelfth, as the Pines card suggests). The postcard has not been conclusively linked to the Zodiac nor has Lass' body been found.  There was no official investigation conducted due to jurisdictional disagreements between the South Lake Tahoe Police and the Sheriff's Department, and it is unknown whether a crime was even committed.

== Timeline ==

=== Lake Herman Road ===

The Zodiac Killer came to police attention for the apparently random murders of '''Betty Lou Jensen''' and '''David Faraday''' on [[December 20]], [[1968]], just inside the [[Benicia, California]] city limits.

The couple were on their first date and had planned to attend a Christmas concert at Hogan High, which was just a few blocks from Jensen's home, but instead decided to visit a friend and stopped at a local restaurant. 

At approximately 10:15 pm, Faraday and Jensen parked in a gravel turnout on Lake Herman Road. Shortly after 11 pm, the Zodiac pulled into the turnout and parked beside them. At least one witness drove by moments later and saw both cars, but did not see anyone inside either vehicle. Moments later he heard what seemed to be a gunshot, but was not sure since his radio was on. 

The Zodiac shot Faraday once in the head and Jensen five times in the back as she ran away. Their bodies were found minutes later by Stella Borges, who lived nearby. She alerted Captain Daniel Pitta and Officer William T. Warner. Detective Sergeant Les Lundblad of the Solano County Sheriff's Department investigated the crime, but no solid leads developed.

=== Blue Rock Springs ===

'''Darlene Ferrin''' and '''Michael Mageau''' were shot around midnight on [[July 4]] - [[July 5]], [[1969]], at the Blue Rock Springs Golf Course parking lot in [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]], four miles from the Lake Herman Road murder site.  While they sat in Ferrin's car, another car drove into the lot and parked beside them, drove away almost immediately, then returned about 10 minutes later.  The Zodiac parked behind them to prevent  escape and approached the passenger side door with a flashlight, which he used to blind them.  He then shot them with a [[9mm Luger]] handgun.

At 12:40 am on [[July 5]], [[1969]], a man anonymously called the Vallejo Police Department to report and claim responsibility for the attack.  He also took credit for the murders of Jensen and Faraday six and a half months earlier. The police traced the call to a phone booth at a gas station at Springs and Tuolumne, about three tenths of a mile from Ferrin's home and only a few blocks from the Vallejo Sheriff's Department.<ref>{{cite web | title= Vallejo | publisher=AOL | url=http://members.aol.com/Jakewark/vallejo.html | accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref>

Ferrin was pronounced dead at the hospital.  Mageau survived the attack despite being shot in the face, neck and chest.  

Ferrin was a waitress at Terry's Waffle House in Vallejo. In a [[Zodiac (book)|popular book]] about the case published 17 years after the crime, an unsubstantiated{{fact|date=May 2007}} story circulated that the Zodiac was an admirer and regular customer of Ferrin's.  The book claimed that she knew he was responsible for the Lake Herman Road (and perhaps other) murders, and that he killed her either to prevent her from reporting him to the police or because she was [[blackmail]]ing him in exchange for her silence.  These allegations are unsupported and can be traced directly to the low-budget 1971 movie, ''The Zodiac Killer'', the 1979 novel ''The Zodiac Killer'' by Jerry Weissman, and a [[May 4]] [[1981]] story by Bill Wallace that appeared in the ''Chronicle''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Ferrin-Mageau Related Information | publisher=The Zodiac/Manson Collection | url=http://www.zodiacmurders.com/ferrin_mageau_related.html | accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Zodiac killer theories | publisher=Cannonfire | url=http://cannonfire.blogspot.com/2005/04/zodiac-killer-theories.html | date=2007-04-20 | accessdate=2007-04-27 |first= Joseph}}</ref> Detectives John Lynch and Ed Rust of the Vallejo Police Department initially investigated the crime.  Detective Jack Mulanax took over the case in the 1970s.

=== The Zodiac letters begin ===
[[Image:Zodiac-logo.jpg|thumb|The crosshair-like symbol used by the Zodiac Killer in signing his letters.]]
On [[August 1]] [[1969]], three letters prepared by Zodiac were received at the ''Vallejo Times-Herald'', the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', and the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''.  The nearly identically written letters took credit for the three murders and also included one third of a cryptogram with a total of 360 characters which he claimed contained his identity. Zodiac demanded they be printed on the front page or he would go on a rampage and kill a dozen people that weekend.  The threatened murders did not happen, and all three parts were eventually published.  

On [[August 4]] [[1969]], another letter was received at the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' with the salutation, "Dear Editor This is the Zodiac speaking".  The letter was in response to Chief Stiltz of Vallejo asking him to provide more details to prove he was really the killer of Faraday, Jensen and Ferrin.

On [[August 8]] [[1969]], Donald and Bettye Harden of [[Salinas, California]] cracked the cryptogram, which did not contain Zodiac's name.  The message read (including misspellings):

{{cquote|''I LIKE KILLING PEOPLE BECAUSE IT IS SO MUCH FUN IT IS MORE FUN THAN KILLING WILD GAME IN THE FORREST BECAUSE MAN IS THE MOST DANGEROUS ANAMAL OF ALL TO KILL SOMETHING GIVES ME THE MOST THRILLING EXPERENCE IT IS EVEN BETTER THAN GETTING YOUR ROCKS OFF WITH A GIRL THE BEST PART OF IT IS THAT WHEN I DIE I WILL BE REBORN IN PARADICE AND ALL THE I HAVE KILLED WILL BECOME MY SLAVES I WILL NOT GIVE YOU MY NAME BECAUSE YOU WILL TRY TO SLOI DOWN OR STOP MY COLLECTING OF SLAVES FOR MY AFTERLIFE EBEORIETEMETHHPITI''}}

The meaning of the final eighteen symbols was not determined. In the [[television program]] [[Unsolved Mysteries]], it is suggested that the final eighteen symbols are the Zodiac killer signing his letter with the name [[Theodore J. Kaczynski]].

=== Lake Berryessa ===

On [[September 27]] [[1969]], '''Bryan Hartnell''' and '''Cecelia Shepard''' were picnicking on the shores of [[Lake Berryessa]], on a small island connected by a sand spit to Twin Oak Ridge. A man approached them wearing a black executioner's type hood with clip-on sunglasses over the eye-holes and a bib-like device on his chest that had a white 3"x3" cross-circle symbol on it. He approached them with a gun Hartnell believed to be a [[.45]].  The hooded man claimed to be an escaped convict from [[Deer Lodge, Montana]], where he killed a guard and stole a car, and explained that he needed their car and money to go to [[Mexico]]. He had brought precut lengths of plastic clothesline and told Shepard to tie up Hartnell, before tying her up.  The Zodiac checked and tightened Hartnell's bonds after discovering she bound him loosely.  Hartnell initially believed it to be a weird robbery, but Zodiac drew a knife and stabbed them both, then hiked the 500 yards back up to Knoxville Road, drew the cross circle symbol on Hartnell's car door, and wrote beneath it: '''Vallejo 12-20-68, 7-4-69, Sept 27-69-6:30 by knife.'''

At 7:40 p.m., the man called the [[Napa County, California|Napa County]] Sheriff's office from a [[pay telephone]] to report his crime.  The phone was found still off the hook minutes later at the Napa Car Wash on Main Street in [[Napa, California|Napa]] by KVON radio reporter Pat Stanley,<ref name="Pat Stanley">{{cite web | title= Zodiac on the line ... | publisher=The Napa Valley Register | url=http://www.napavalleyregister.com/articles/2007/02/18/news/local/iq_3812957.txt  | accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> only a few blocks from the sheriff's  office and 27 miles from the crime scene. Detectives were able to lift fresh [[fingerprint]]s from the telephone but were never able to match them to a suspect.

A man and his son who were fishing in a nearby cove had discovered the victims after hearing their screams for help and summoned help by contacting park rangers.  Napa County Sheriff Deputies Dave Collins and Ray Land were the first law enforcement officers to arrive at the scene of the assault.<ref>{{cite web | title=Online exclusive: In the wake, of the Zodiac | publisher=The Napa Valley Register | url=[http://www.napavalleyregister.com/articles/2007/02/18/news/local/iq_3823497.txt | accessdate=2007-05-10 | last=Dorgan | fast=Marsha}}</ref> Both officers were quite some distance from the crime scene when they were dispatched to the scene. Collins was on patrol in the [[Vichy Springs, California|Vichy Springs]] area about 20 miles away while Land was in [[St. Helena, California|St. Helena]]. Cecelia Shepard was conscious when Collins arrived and  gave him a detailed description of the attacker. Hartnell and Shepard were taken to Queen of the Valley Hospital in Napa by ambulance. Shepard lapsed into a coma during transport to the hospital and never regained consciousness.  She died two days later, but Hartnell survived to recount his tale <ref>L. Pierce Carson.

=== Presidio Heights ===
On [[October 11]], [[1969]], a man entered '''Paul Stine''''s cab at the intersection of Mason and Geary Streets in [[San Francisco]] and requested to be taken to Washington and Maple Streets in [[Neighborhoods in San Francisco, California#Presidio Heights|Presidio Heights]]. For reasons unknown, Stine drove one block further to Cherry Street; the man shot him once in the head with a 9mm, then took his wallet and car keys and tore off his shirt tail.  He was observed by three teenagers across the street at 9:55 pm, who called the police as the crime was in progress.  They observed the man wiping the cab down, and then walking away towards the Presidio, one block to the north.  The police arrived minutes later, and the teen witnesses explained that the killer was still nearby.

Two blocks from the crime scene, officer Don Fouke, also responding to the call, observed a white man walking along the sidewalk then stepping onto a stairway leading up to the front yard of one of the homes on the north side of the street; the encounter lasted only five to ten seconds.  His partner, Eric Zelms, did not see the man.  The radio dispatch had alerted them to look for a black and not a white suspect, so they had no reason to talk to the man and drove past him without stopping; the mix up in descriptions remains unexplained to this day.  When they reached Cherry, Fouke was informed that they were in fact looking for a white suspect; Fouke realized they must have passed the killer. Fouke concluded that the Zodiac had resumed his original route and escaped into the [[Presidio_of_San_Francisco|Presidio]], so they entered the base to look for him but the killer had vanished.  A search ensued, but nothing was found. The three teen witnesses worked with a police artist to prepare a composite of Stine's killer, and a few days later returned to produce a second composite.  The Zodiac was estimated to be 35-45 years of age.  Detectives Bill Armstrong and [[Dave Toschi]] were assigned to the case. The San Francisco Police Department eventually investigated an estimated 2,500 suspects over a period of years.<ref>Drake, Rossiter.  [http://www.examiner.com/a-593956~Author_believes_he_knows_Zodiac_Killer_s_identity.html Author believes he knows Zodiac Killer's identity]; [[San Francisco Examiner]]; [[2007-03-01]]; accessed [[2007-03-07]].</ref>

On [[October 14]] [[1969]], the ''Chronicle'' received yet another letter from the Zodiac, this time containing a swatch of Paul Stine's shirt tail as proof he was the killer; it also included a threat about shooting school children.  It was only then that the police knew who they were looking for a few nights before in Presidio Heights.

At 2:00 am on [[October 22]] [[1969]], someone claiming to be the Zodiac called [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] PD demanding that one of two prominent lawyers, [[F. Lee Bailey]] or [[Melvin Belli]], appear on [[Jim Dunbar]]'s television talk show in the morning.  Bailey was not available, but Belli appeared on the show.  Dunbar appealed to the viewers to keep the lines open, and eventually, someone claiming to be the Zodiac called several times and said his name was Sam.  Belli agreed to meet with him in Daly City, but the suspect never showed up. Police officers who had heard the Zodiac listened to "Sam"'s voice and agreed that he was not the Zodiac.  Subsequent calls the suspect made to Belli were traced to the Napa State Hospital, where it was learned that "Sam" was a mental patient.

On [[November 8]], [[1969]], the Zodiac mailed a card with another cryptogram consisting of 340 characters. On [[November 9]], [[1969]], he mailed a seven-page letter in which he claimed that two policemen stopped and actually spoke with him three minutes after he shot Stine.  Excerpts from the letter were published in the ''Chronicle'' on November 12, including the Zodiac's claim; that same day, Don Fouke wrote a memo explaining what had happened that night. The 340 character cipher has never been decoded.<ref name="340z">{{cite web|url=http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/chris/z/340explain.html|title=Alphabet of the 340 Character Zodiac Cypher|author=Chris McCarthy}}</ref> Many possible "solutions" have been suggested, but cannot be accepted since they do away with codemaking conventions.

On [[December 20]], [[1969]], the Zodiac mailed a letter to Belli and included yet another swatch of Stine's shirt; the Zodiac claimed he wanted Belli to help him.

=== Modesto ===

On the night of [[March 22]], [[1970]], '''Kathleen Johns''' was driving from [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] to [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]] to visit her mother. She was seven months pregnant and had her '''10-month-old daughter''' beside her. While heading west on Highway 132 near [[Modesto, California|Modesto]], a car behind her began honking and flashing its lights.  She pulled off the road and stopped. The man in the car parked behind her, stated her right rear tire was wobbling, and offered to tighten the lugs. After finishing his work, the man drove off, and when Johns pulled forward the wheel came off the car. The man stopped, backed up, and offered to drive her to the nearest gas station for help. She and her daughter climbed into his car. They drove past several service stations but the man did not stop. For some three hours he drove them up and down the backroads around [[Tracy, California|Tracy]], and when she asked why he was not stopping, he would change the subject.<ref name="JOHNSREPORT">[http://www.zodiackiller.com/JohnsReport.html Police report]</ref>

When the driver stopped at an intersection, Johns jumped out with her daughter and hid in a field.  He came out to look for her, but when a truck driver spotted the scene Johns' abductor drove off. Johns hitched a ride to the police station in [[Patterson, California|Patterson]]. As she gave her statement to the sergeant on duty, she noticed the police composite of Paul Stine's killer and recognized him as the man who abducted her and her child. The sergeant had Johns wait in nearby Mil's Restaurant in the dark.  Her car was eventually found &mdash; torched and gutted.

There are many conflicting accounts of the Johns abduction. Most claim he threatened to kill her and her daughter while driving them around, but at least one police report disputes that.<ref name="JOHNSREPORT"/>  Johns' account to Paul Avery of the ''Chronicle'' indicates her abductor left his car and searched for her in the dark with a flashlight; however, in the two reports she made to the police, she stated he did not leave the vehicle.<ref name="HIGHWAY">[http://members.aol.com/Jakewark/132.html This Is The Zodiac Speaking/Highway 132]</ref> Some accounts state Johns' vehicle was moved then torched, while others contend it was  located where she'd left it.<ref name="HIGHWAY"/> The various discrepancies among Johns' accounts over the years have led many researchers to question if she was an actual Zodiac victim.<ref>[http://www.zodiackiller.com/Johns.html Johns profile]</ref>

=== Further communications ===

The Zodiac continued to communicate with authorities for the remainder of 1970 via letters and greeting cards to the press. In a letter postmarked [[April 20]], [[1970]], the Zodiac wrote, "My name is [blank]," followed by a 13-character cipher.<ref>[http://zodiackiller.com/MyNameIsLetter.html "My Name Is" letter]; accessed [[2007-03-08]]</ref>  The Zodiac went on to state that he was not responsible for the recent bombing of a police station in San Francisco (referring to the [[February 18]], [[1970]], death of Sgt. Brian McDonnell at Park Station in [[Golden Gate Park]])<ref name="BLOODY">Zamorra, Jim Herron.  [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/01/27/MNG9DNQ8TQ1.DTL 1967-71 -- a bloody period for S.F. police].  [[San Francisco Chronicle]]; [[2007-01-27]]; accessed [[2007-03-07]]</ref> but added "there is more glory to killing a cop than a cid [''sic''] because a cop can shoot back."  The letter included a diagram of a bomb the Zodiac claimed he would use to blow up a school bus. At the bottom of the diagram, he had written: "[[Image:Zodiac-logo.jpg|45px]] = 10, SFPD = 0".<ref>[http://www.zodiackiller.com/MyNameIsLetter.html "My Name Is" letter]</ref>

Zodiac sent a greeting card postmarked [[April 28]], [[1970]], to the ''Chronicle''.  Written on the card was, "I hope you enjoy yourselves when I have my BLAST," followed by the Zodiac's cross circle signature.  On the back of the card, the Zodiac threatened to use his bus bomb soon unless the newspaper published the full details he wrote.  He also wanted to start seeing people wearing "some nice Zodiac butons" [''sic'']."<ref>[http://www.zodiackiller.com/DragonCard.html Dragon card letter]</ref>

In a letter postmarked [[June 26]], [[1970]], the Zodiac stated he was upset he did not see people wearing Zodiac buttons. He wrote, "I shot a man sitting in a parked car with a .38." <ref>[http://www.zodiackiller.com/ZButtonLetter.html Button letter]</ref> It has been proposed the Zodiac was referring to the murder of Sgt Richard Radetich a week earlier, on June 19.  At 5:25 AM, Radetich was writing a parking ticket in his squad car when an assailant shot him in the head with a .38-caliber pistol.  Radetich died 15 hours later.  SFPD denies the Zodiac murderer was involved in this murder. It remains unsolved.<ref NAME="BLOODY"/>

Included with the letter was a [[Phillips 66]] map of the San Francisco Bay Area.  On the image of [[Mount Diablo]], the Zodiac had drawn a crossed-circle similar to that he had included in previous correspondence.  At the top of the crossed circle, he placed a zero, and then a three, six, and a nine, so the annotation resembled a clock face.  The accompanying instructions stated that the zero was <U+201C>to be set to Mag. N."<ref>[http://www.zodiackiller.com/ZMap.html Zodiac map letter]</ref>  The letter also included a 32-letter cipher that the killer claimed would, in conjunction with the code, lead to the location of a bomb he had buried and set to go off in the autumn.  (The bomb was never located).  The killer had signed the note with "[[Image:Zodiac-logo.jpg|45px]] = 12, SFPD = 0".

In a letter to the ''Chronicle'' postmarked [[July 24]], [[1970]], the Zodiac took credit for the Kathleen Johns abduction, four months after the incident.<ref>[http://www.zodiackiller.com/JohnsLetter.html Zodiac Johns letter]</ref>

In his [[July 26]], [[1970]] letter, the Zodiac paraphrased a song from ''[[The Mikado]]'', adding his own lyrics about making a "little list" of the ways he planned to [[torture]] his "slaves" in "paradice."  The letter was signed with a large, exaggerated cross circle symbol and a new score: "[[Image:Zodiac-logo.jpg|45px]] = 13, SFPD = 0".<ref>[http://www.zodiackiller.com/Mikado1.html Zodiac Mikado letter]</ref>  A final note at the bottom of the letter stated, "P.S. The Mt. Diablo code concerns Radians + # inches along the radians." <ref>[http://www.zodiackiller.com/Mikado5.html Zodiac Mikado letter, cont.]</ref> In [[1981]], a close examination of the radian hint by Zodiac researcher [[Gareth Penn]] led to the discovery that a [[radian]] angle, when placed over the map per Zodiac's instructions, pointed to the locations of two Zodiac attacks. <ref>Rowlett, Curt, ''Labyrinth13: True Tales of the Occult, Crime & Conspiracy'', Chapter 9, ''The Z Files: Labyrinth13 Examines the Zodiac Murders'', ''The Rhyme of the Radian'', pp. 64-68.

=== Riverside ===

On [[October 27]], [[1970]], ''Chronicle'' reporter Paul Avery (who had been covering the Zodiac case) received a [[Halloween]] card signed with a letter 'Z' and the Zodiac's cross circle symbol.  Handwritten on the card was the note "Peek-a-boo, you are doomed."  The threat was taken seriously and received a front page story on the ''Chronicle''.  Soon after, Avery received an anonymous letter alerting him to the similarities between the Zodiac's activities and the unsolved murder of '''Cheri Jo Bates''', which had occurred four years earlier at the city college in [[Riverside, California]] in the [[Los Angeles]] area, more than 400 miles south of San Francisco.  He reported his findings in the ''Chronicle'' on [[November 16]], [[1970]].

On [[October 30]], [[1966]], Bates spent the evening at the campus library annex until it closed at 9:00 pm.  Neighbors reported they heard a scream around 10:30 pm.  Bates was found dead the next morning a short distance from the library between two abandoned houses slated to be demolished for campus renovations.  The wires in her [[Volkswagen]]'s [[distributor cap]] had been pulled out.  She was brutally beaten and stabbed to death.  A man's Timex watch with a torn wristband was found nearby. The watch had stopped at 12:24, but it is believed the attack occurred much earlier.  Also discovered were the prints of a military-style shoe.<ref>[http://www.zodiackiller.com/Bates.html Cheri Jo Bates information]</ref>

[[Image:Zodiac Killer - first letter.jpg|thumb|The Confession]]
A month later, on [[November 29]] [[1966]], nearly identical typewritten letters were mailed to the Riverside police and the ''Riverside Press-Enterprise''.  Titled "The Confession", the author claimed responsibility for the Bates murder, providing details of the crime not released to the public, and warned that Bates "is not the first and she will not be the last."

In [[December]], [[1966]], a poem was discovered carved into the bottom side of a desktop in the Riverside City College library.  Titled "Sick of living/unwilling to die", the poem's language and handwriting resembled those of the Zodiac's letters.  It was signed with what were assumed to be the initials "rh".  Sherwood Morrill, California's top Questioned Documents examiner, expressed his opinion that the poem was written by the Zodiac.

On [[April 30]], [[1967]] &mdash; the six-month anniversary of Bates' murder &mdash; Bates' father Joseph, the ''Press-Enterprise'', and the Riverside police all received nearly identical letters.  In handwritten scrawl, the ''Press-Enterprise'' and police copies read "Bates had to die there will be more," with a small scribble at the bottom that resembled the letter 'Z'.  Joseph Bates' copy read "She had to die there will be more" without a 'Z' <U+201C>signature<U+201D>.

On [[March 13]], [[1971]], nearly four months after Paul Avery's first article on Bates, the Zodiac mailed a letter to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.  In it he credited the police instead of Avery for discovering his "Riverside activity, but they are only finding the easy ones, there are a hell of a lot more down there."<ref>[http://members.aol.com/Jakewark/connect.html L.A. Times 1971 Zodiac letter]</ref>

The connection between Cheri Jo Bates, Riverside, and the Zodiac remains uncertain.  The Riverside Police Department maintains that the Bates homicide was not committed by the Zodiac, but did concede some of the Bates letters may have been his work to falsely claim credit.<ref>Zimmerman, Janet.

=== Lake Tahoe ===

On [[March 22]] [[1971]], a postcard to the ''Chronicle'' addressed to "Paul Averly" -- intended for Paul Avery and believed to be from the Zodiac -- appeared to take credit for the disappearance of '''[[Donna Lass]]''' from [[South Lake Tahoe, California]] on [[September 26]], [[1970]].  Made from a [[collage]] of advertisements and magazine lettering, it featured a scene from an ad for Forest Pines and the text "[[Sierra Club]]," "Sought Victim 12," "peek through the pines," "pass Lake Tahoe areas," and "around in the snow."  Zodiac's cross circle symbol was in the place of the usual return address.<ref>[http://www.zodiackiller.com/PinesCard.html Zodiac postcard]</ref>

Lass was a nurse at the [[Sahara Tahoe]] hotel and casino.  She worked until approximately 2:00 am on [[September 26]], treating her last patient at 1:40 am, and was not seen leaving her office.  The next morning, her work uniform and shoes were found in a paper bag in her office inexplicably soiled with dirt.  Her car was found at her apartment complex, and her apartment was spotless.<ref name="LASS">[http://www.zodiackiller.com/mba/opzv/96.html Message board containing email from former Lake Tahoe police oficer]</ref> Later that day both her employer and her landlord received phone calls from an unknown male who falsely claimed Lass had to leave town due to a family emergency.<ref>[http://www.zodiackiller.com/Lass.html Lass information]</ref> The police and sheriffs' office initially treated Lass' disappearance as a missing persons investigation, suspecting she simply left on her own.<ref name="LASS"/> Lass was never found.  What appeared to be a grave site was discovered near the Claire Tappan Lodge in [[Norden]], California on Sierra Club property, but excavation yielded only a pair of sunglasses.<ref>[http://www.zodiacmurders.com/victim_lass.html Lass profile]</ref>

=== Santa Barbara ===

In a ''Vallejo Times-Herald'' story that appeared on [[November 13]], [[1972]], Santa Barbara Sheriff's Detective Bill Baker (ret.) theorized that the murders of a young couple in [[Santa Barbara County]] may have been the work of the Zodiac.

On [[June 4]], [[1963]] (five and a half years prior to the Zodiac's first known murders on Lake Herman Road), high-school senior '''Robert Domingos''' and fianc<U+00E9>e '''Linda Edwards''' were shot to death on a beach near [[Lompoc, California]], having skipped school that day for "[[Senior Skip Day|Senior Ditch Day]]". Police believed that the assailant attempted to bind the victims, but when they freed themselves attempting to flee, he shot them repeatedly in the back and chest with a .22-caliber weapon. He then placed their bodies in a small nearby shack and tried, unsuccessfully, to burn it down.<ref name="SBMURDER">[http://www.zodiacmurders.com/victim_sb_murders.html Santa Barbara murders]</ref>

Some believe that the murders of Domingos and Edwards are the work of the Zodiac because of similarities between this case and the Zodiac's attack at Lake Berryessa.<ref name="SBMURDER"/>

=== The final letters ===

After the "Pines" card, the Zodiac remained silent for nearly three years, after which the ''Chronicle'' received a letter from the Zodiac, postmarked [[January 29]], [[1974]], praising ''[[The Exorcist]]'' as "the best saterical [sic] comidy [sic]" that he had ever seen. The letter included a snippet of verse from ''[[The Mikado]]'' and an unusual symbol at the bottom that has gone unexplained by researchers.  Zodiac concluded the letter with a new score, "Me = 37, SFPD = 0".<ref>[http://www.zodiackiller.com/ExorcistLetter.html Zodiac Exorcist letter]</ref>

The ''Chronicle'' received another letter postmarked [[February 14]], [[1974]], informing the editor that the initials for the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] spelled out an [[Old Norse]] word meaning "kill."<ref>[http://members.aol.com/Jakewark/SLA.html SLA Letter]</ref> The handwriting was not authenticated as the Zodiac's, however.

Another letter received by the ''Chronicle'', postmarked [[May 8]], [[1974]], featured a complaint that the movie ''[[Badlands_(film)|Badlands]]'' was "murder-glorification" and asked the paper to cut its advertisements. Signed only "A citizen", the handwriting, tone, and surface irony are all similar to prior Zodiac communications.<ref>[http://www.zodiackiller.com/CitizenLetter.html Citizen Letter]</ref>

The ''Chronicle'' received an anonymous letter postmarked [[July 8]], [[1974]], complaining about one of its columnists, Marco Spinelli.  The letter was signed "the Red Phantom (red with rage)". The Zodiac's authorship of this letter is debated.<ref>[http://www.zodiackiller.com/RedPhantomLetter.html Red Phantom letter]</ref>

Another four years passed without communication <U+2014> purported or verified <U+2014> from the Zodiac. A letter of [[April 24]], [[1978]], was initially deemed authentic, but was declared by three other experts to be a hoax less than three months later. In recent years, however, the letter has been deemed in some quarters as authentic. Toschi, the SFPD homicide detective who had been on the case since the Stine murder, was thought to have forged the letter, since author [[Armistead Maupin]] thought it similar to "fan mail" he received in 1976 that he believed was authored by Toschi. While he admitted writing the fan mail, Toschi denied forging the Zodiac letter and was eventually cleared of any charges. The authenticity of the letter remains in question.

On [[March 3]], [[2007]], it was reported that an [[American Greetings]] [[Christmas card]] sent to the ''Chronicle'' postmarked 1990 in [[Eureka, California|Eureka]] had been recently discovered in their photo files by editorial assistant Daniel King.<ref>Williams, Lance.  [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/03/03/MNG37OETI71.DTL&hw=zodiac+christmas+card&sn=001&sc=1000 Zodiac's written clues fascinate document expert].  [[San Francisco Chronicle]], [[March 3]] [[2007]].  Accessed [[March 15]] [[2007]].</ref>  Inside the envelope with the card was a photocopy of two [[United States Post Office|U.S. Postal]] keys on a magnet keychain.  The handwriting on the envelope resembles Zodiac's print, but was declared inauthentic by forensic document examiner Lloyd Cunningham.  Not all Zodiac experts, however, agree with Cunningham's analysis.<ref>Freedman, Rich. [http://www.timesheraldonline.com/todaysnews/ci_5355609~Zodiac:_Did_killer_send_card_in_1990?

Accessed [[March 16]] [[2007]].</ref>  There is no return address on the envelope nor is his crossed-circle signature to be found.  The card itself is unmarked.<ref>[http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/eurekaenvelopelarge.jpg Christmas card envelope]; [http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/eurekacard1large.jpg Christmas card front]; [http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/eurekacard2large.jpg Christmas card interior]; [http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/xerox.jpg Photocopy of Christmas card keys and pencil].  Accessed [[March 15]] [[2007]].</ref>  The ''Chronicle'' turned over all the material to the Vallejo Police Department for further analysis.

== Current status ==

The last SFPD investigators of the case were Homicide Detail Inspectors Michael N. Maloney and Kelly Carroll. They were the first to submit [[DNA]] evidence from Zodiac's letters for analysis, which resulted in a partial genetic profile.  DNA testing seems to have conclusively ruled out their lead suspect, Arthur Leigh Allen,<ref>Weiss, Mike; [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/10/15/MN47255.DTL&hw=zodiac+case+dna&sn=006&sc=687 DNA seems to clear only Zodiac suspect]; [[San Francisco Chronicle]]; [[2002-10-12]]; accessed [[2007-02-28]]</ref> and later Mike Rodelli's suspect, a prominent San Francisco businessman who lived near Paul Stine's murder scene.<ref name="CLOSED">Goodyear, Charles; [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/04/07/MNG8N61MGI1.DTL&hw=zodiac+case&sn=002&sc=830 Files shut on Zodiac's deadly trail]; [[San Francisco Chronicle]]; [[2004-04-07]]; accessed [[2007-02-28]]</ref>  

The SFPD marked the case "inactive" in [[April]] [[2004]], citing caseload pressure and resource demands.<ref NAME="CLOSED"/>  They reopened the case some time before [[March]] [[2007]] and returned evidence to Vallejo police for additional DNA testing.<ref>Goldman-Hall, Jason; [http://www.examiner.com/a-594611~Police_still_keep_Zodiac_Killer_s_case_open.html Police still keep Zodiac Killer's case open]; [[San Francisco Examiner]]; [[2007-03-01]]; accessed [[2007-03-04]]</ref>  The case remains open in other jurisdictions as well.
   

==Arthur Leigh Allen==
Though many people have been suspected of being Zodiac through the years, only one, Arthur Leigh Allen ([[December 18]], [[1933]] - [[August 26]], [[1992]]) was seriously investigated. In July 1971, a friend of Allen's reported his suspicions about him to the [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]] Police Department, and the report was forwarded to the [[San Francisco Police Department|SFPD]].<ref name="JAKE"/> When questioned later, Allen claimed without prompting that the bloody knives he had in his car the day of the Lake Berryessa attack had been used to kill chickens; and when asked if he had read ''[[The Most Dangerous Game]]'', he replied affirmatively and said it had made an impression on him.<ref name="JAKE">Wark, Jake, [http://members.aol.com/Jakewark/allen.html The Case Against Arthur Leigh Allen]; 2001, accessed on [[2007-03-01]]</ref> (This interested the police, as the 408-character cipher appears to reference that short story).

Allen was the only suspect in the case whom police had enough evidence against to execute not just one, but three [[search warrant]]s: on September 14, 1972; February 14, 1991; and August 28, 1992, two days after he died.<ref name="JAKE">http://members.aol.com/Jakewark/allen.html</ref><ref>Voight, Tom, [http://www.zodiackiller.com/AllenFile.html The Arthur Leigh Allen File]; 2003; accessed on [[2007-03-01]]</ref> Allen denied his guilt in interviews, but there was much [[circumstantial evidence]] against him.<ref name="CLINT">[http://www.se7en-x.com/zodiac/bio.htm Zodiac case overview by Clint Vander Klok]; accessed on [[2007-03-01]]</ref><ref>[http://www.olesin.50megs.com/zodiac/allen.htm Suspect profile of Arthur Leigh Allen]; accessed on [[2007-03-01]]</ref>

Police found no physical evidence to prove that Allen was the Zodiac Killer, and the Vallejo Police Department chose not to press charges against Allen, even though he was a convicted [[sex offender]], and weapons and explosive components were found in his home following the 1991 search.<ref name="CLINT"/> Ultimately, Allen's handwriting did not match the Zodiac's, his fingerprints did not match those suspected to be Zodiac's, no concrete evidence linking him to the Zodiac killings was ever found, and recent DNA testing on suspected Zodiac letters in 2002 did not provide a match.<ref>Matthias Gaffni, [http://timesheraldonline.com/ci_5280766 Vallejo police send three letters for DNA testing]; [[Times-Herald]]; [[2007-02-22]]; accessed [[2007-03-01]]</ref><ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0210/27/sm.30.html CNN Interview With Kelly Carroll]; Aired [[2002-10-27]]; accessed [[2007-03-01]]</ref> However, neither Vallejo nor SFPD ruled Allen out after the test results.<ref>Matthias Gafni, [http://www.timesheraldonline.com/ci_5288950 Ex-coach, teammate recall Zodiac suspect]; [[Times-Herald]]; [[2007-02-23]]; accessed [[2007-03-01]]</ref>
