{{History of Slovakia}}

The '''Principality of Nitra''',{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=279}}{{sfn|Marsina|1997|p = 15}}{{sfn|Kirschbaum|1996|p=25}} ({{lang-sk|Nitrianske knie<U+017E>atstvo}}; {{lang-hu|nyitrai fejedelems<U+00E9>g}}),{{sfn|Angi|1997|p = 360}} also known as the '''Duchy of Nitra''',{{sfn|Luka<U+010D>ka|2011|p=30}}{{sfn|Steinh<U+00FC>bel|2011|p=15}} was a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] polity encompassing a group of settlements that developed in the 9th century around [[Nitra]] in present-day [[Slovakia]]. Its history remains uncertain{{sfn|Alexander|2005|p=288}} because of a lack of contemporary sources. The territory's status is subject to scholarly debate; some modern historians describe it as an independent polity that was annexed either around 833 or 870 by [[Great Moravia]] while others say that from its inception it was part of Great Moravia. No final list of the princes or dukes of Nitra has been agreed upon by historians.

The [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin]] caused the fall of Great Moravia in the early 900s and the occupation of the lowlands of present-day Slovakia. The local population survived the Hungarian conquest. Although most Slovak historians believe that some noble families continued their landholding after the disintegration of Great Moravia, other historians are less certain.

The history of the wider region of Nitra in the 10th and 11th centuries is also disputed. The region is thought to have formed a separate political unit{{spaced ndash}}the so-called "Nitra appanage duchy"{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=278}}{{spaced ndash}}until 1108. Historian J<U+00E1>n Steinh<U+00FC>bel writes that "Nitra was an autonomous duchy, a clear political entity, which laid the territorial and historical foundation of Slovakia".{{sfn|Steinh<U+00FC>bel|2011|p=29}} According to a concurrent theory, the Nitra region was fully incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], although it was sometimes administered as part of the so-called ''[[Duchy (Kingdom of Hungary)|ducatus]]'' or "duchy"{{spaced ndash}}which encompassed one-third of the kingdom{{spaced ndash}}by non-ruling members of the royal [[<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d dynasty]].

==Background==
Modern-day Slovakia was dominated for centuries by [[Germanic peoples]], including the [[Quadi]] and the [[Longobards]] or Lombards, who were there until the middle of the sixth century.{{sfn|Steinh<U+00FC>bel|2011|pp=16-18}} A new [[material culture]] characterized by handmade pottery, cremation burials and small, square, sunken huts that typically featured a corner stone oven appeared in the plains along the [[Middle Danube]] around that time.{{sfn|Barford|2001|pp=38-39, 63-64}}{{sfn|Steinh<U+00FC>bel|2011|p=15}} The new culture, with its "spartan and egalitarian" nature, sharply differed from the earlier [[archaeological culture]]s of Central Europe.{{sfn|Barford|2001|pp=44, 63-64}} According to Barford, a report by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[Procopius]] is the first certain reference to [[Early Slavs|Early Slav]] groups inhabiting parts of present-day Slovakia.{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=56}} Procopius wrote that an exiled Lombard prince named Hildigis mustered an army, "taking with him not only those of the Lombards who had followed him, but also many of the [[Sclaveni]]"<ref>''Procopius: History of the Wars'' (7.35.19.), pp.&nbsp;461<U+2013>463.</ref> in the 540s.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=55}}{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=56}}

The nomadic [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]], who arrived from the [[Eurasian steppes]], invaded the [[Carpathian Basin]] and subjected the local inhabitants in the second half of the sixth century.{{sfn|Barford|2001|pp = 56-57}}{{sfn|Kirschbaum|1996|p = 18}} Thereafter, Slavic groups inhabiting areas around the core regions of the [[Avar Khaganate]] paid tribute to the Avars.{{sfn|Urba<U+0144>czyk|2005|p = 144}} The khaganate experienced a series of internal conflicts in the 630s.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p = 76}} According to the ''[[Chronicle of Fredegar]]'', the "Slavs who are known as Wends" rebelled against the Avars and elected a [[Franks|Frankish]] trader named [[Samo]] as their king in the early seventh century.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p = 77}} Samo's realm, which emerged in the northern or northwestern regions of the Carpathian Basin, existed for more than three decades.{{sfn|Urba<U+0144>czyk|2005|p = 144}}{{sfn|Kirschbaum|1996|p = 19}}{{sfn|Barford|2001|p = 79}} It disintegrated soon after its founder's death and Avar control of the region was restored.{{sfn|Kirschbaum|1996|p = 19}}

The Avar Khaganate collapsed around 803 as a result of several successful military campaigns launched by the [[Carolingian Empire|Franks]] against it.{{sfn|Urba<U+0144>czyk|2005|p = 144}}{{sfn|Steinh<U+00FC>bel|2011|p = 16}} The fall of the Khaganate contributed to the rise of new polities among the Slavs in the region.{{sfn|Steinh<U+00FC>bel|2011|p = 16}}{{sfn|Urba<U+0144>czyk|2005|p = 145}} The shift in political control was accompanied by changes in military strategy and equipment. According to Curta, swords and other items of the "[[Blatnica-Mikul<U+010D>ice horizon]]" show "a shift from the [[Cavalry tactics#Riding and fighting on horseback#Tactics of light and medium cavalry using bows|mounted combat tactics typical of nomadic warfare]] to heavy cavalry equipment",{{sfn|Curta|2006|p = 130}} and the development of a local elite in the regions to the north of the river [[Danube]] and the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] in the early 800s.{{sfn|Urba<U+0144>czyk|2005|p = 145}}

The main source of information about the polity now known as the Principality of Nitra is the ''[[Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum|Conversion of the Bavarians and Carantanians]]'', a document dated to approximately 870.{{sfn|Angi|1997|p = 360}}{{sfn|Bowlus|2009|p=318}}{{sfn|Kirschbaum|1996|p=319}} The manuscripts state that "one Pribina", who had been "driven across the Danube by [[Mojmir I|Mojmir]], duke of the Moravians",{{sfn|Wolfram|1979|p=50}} fled to Ratpot, [[March of Pannonia|Markgrave of Pannonia]] (c. 833<U+2013>856) in [[East Francia]] around 833.{{sfn|Kirschbaum|1996|p=25}}{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=19}} Ratpot introduced him to King [[Louis the German]], who ordered that Pribina should be "instructed in the faith and baptized".{{sfn|Wolfram|1979|p=50}}{{sfn|Bowlus|2009|p=318}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=133}}{{sfn|Kirschbaum|1996|pp=25-26}} According to a sentence in three of the eleven extant manuscripts of the ''Conversion'', Archbishop [[Adalram|Adalram of Salzburg]] (r. 821<U+2013>836) consecrated a church for Pribina "on his estate at a place over the Danube called Nitrava"{{sfn|Wolfram|1979|p=50}} at an unspecified date.{{sfn|Bowlus|2009|p=318}} Modern historians debate whether this sentence was part of the original text or was only a marginal note which was interpolated into the main text in the 12th century.{{sfn|Bowlus|2009|p=327}}{{sfn|T<U+0159>e<U+0161>t<U+00ED>k|2010|pp=113<U+2013>114}} 

Modern historians have not accepted a uniform interpretation of the cited texts.

Luka<U+010D>ka describes this polity as the "first demonstrable Slavic state north of the middle Danube".{{sfn|Luka<U+010D>ka|2011|p=30}} Barford writes that Pribina "was apparently prince of Nitra".{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=298}} According to Marsina, it "can hardly be unambiguously decided whether Pribina was prince of a greater tribe or of two or three smaller joined tribes".{{sfn|Marsina|1997|p=18}} He adds that Pribina may have belonged to the second or third generation of the heads of this polity, which emerged in the valleys of the rivers [[Hron]], Nitra, and [[V<U+00E1>h]].{{sfn|Marsina|1997|p=19}} Luka<U+010D>ka says that Pribina had a retinue and that most its members "certainly descended from the former tribal aristocracy" but some of them "could have come from the free strata of the mass of the people".{{sfn|Luka<U+010D>ka|2011|p=30}}

According to Vlasto, Pribina was Duke Mojmir of Moravia's lieutenant in Nitra and his attempts to achieve independence led to his exile.{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=24}} Vlasto identifies an early medieval church{{spaced ndash}}the remains of which were unearthed on St Martin's Hill in Nitra{{spaced ndash}}as the church which was consecrated by Archbishop Adalram in Pribina's Nitrava, according to the ''Conversion''.{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=24}} Bowlus and P<U+00FC>sp<U+00F6>ki Nagy refute the identification of Pribina's Nitrava with Nitra.{{sfn|Bowlus|2009|pp=322-325}}{{sfn|P<U+00FC>sp<U+00F6>ki Nagy|1978|pp = 20-21}} Scholars who write that Pribina was an independent ruler also say that his principality was united with Moravia after he was exiled from his homeland in around 833.{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=279}}{{sfn|Kirschbaum|1996|p=25}}{{sfn|Sz<U+0151>ke|1994|p=559}}{{sfn|Steinh<U+00FC>bel|2011|p=16}}{{sfn|Luka<U+010D>ka|2011|p=31}}{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=218}} Kirschbaum{{sfn|Kirschbaum|1996|p=25}} and  Steinh<U+00FC>bel{{sfn|Steinh<U+00FC>bel|2011|p=16}} add that the forced unification of the two principalities{{spaced ndash}}Mojmir's Moravia and Pribina's Nitra{{spaced ndash}}under Mojmir gave rise to the empire of Great Moravia. Marsina writes that the inhabitants of Pribina's principality who "definitely were aware of their difference from the Moravian Slavs" preserved their "specific consciousness" even within Great Moravia, which contributed to the development of the common consciousness of the ancestors of the Slovak people.{{sfn|Marsina|1997|p=19}}

According to them, a young member of the [[House of Mojmir]] or the heir to the throne administered Nitra and its region. They identify the ''regnum'' or "territory"<ref>''The Annals of Fulda'' (year 869), p. 60.</ref> of [[Svatopluk I|Svatopluk]], who was a nephew of Duke [[Rastislav]] of Moravia, with the Principality of Nitra.{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=20}}{{sfn|Kirschbaum|1996|p=28}} Svatopluk's ''regnum'' is first mentioned in the year 869 in the ''[[Annals of Fulda]]''.{{sfn|Bowlus|2009|p=324}} Marsina writes that it is probable that Svatopluk annexed the [[Spi<U+0161>]] and [[Gemer]] regions, which according to him were inhabited by "Slavs closely related to the Nitra Slavs".{{sfn|Marsina|1997|p=19}}

A letter of [[Pope John VIII]] reveals that Svatopluk{{spaced ndash}}who in 870 became the sole ruler of Great Moravia{{spaced ndash}}urged the Holy See to ordain a [[Swabia]]n monk named [[Wiching]] as a bishop.{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=21}}{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=74}} The pope granted Svatopluk's request and consecrated Wiching as the first bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nitra|Diocese of Nitra]] ''(sancta ecclesia Nitrensis)''{{sfn|Sz<U+0151>ke|1994|p=559}} in 880.{{sfn|Bowlus|2009|p=325}}{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=74}} The new bishop was subordinated to Archbishop [[Saint Methodius of Thessaloniki|Methodius]], who with his brother Constantine{{spaced ndash}}the future [[Saint Cyril the Philosopher]]{{spaced ndash}}introduced the liturgy officiated in [[Old Church Slavonic]] into Great Moravia.{{sfn|Kirschbaum|2007|pp=87, 192, 308}} Bishop Wiching, who was a staunch supporter of the Latin rite, opposed the use of vernacular in liturgy.{{sfn|Kirschbaum|2007|p=308}} He played a pre-eminent role in the ban on the liturgical use of Old Church Slavonic and the persecution of Methodius's disciplines after the latter's death in 885.{{sfn|Kirschbaum|1996|p=33}}

According to Marsina, the establishment of the first [[suffragan bishop]]ric in Great Moravia with a [[Episcopal see|see]] in Nitra shows that the Nitra region "was regarded as a distinctive unit almost 50 years after its occupation" around 833.{{sfn|Marsina|1997|p=19}} According to a letter that Archbishop [[Dietmar I, Archbishop of Salzburg|Theotmar of Salzburg]] and his suffragans wrote around 900, the pope sent Wiching "to a newly baptized people" whom Svatopluk "had defeated in war and converted from paganism to Christianity".{{sfn|Bowlus|2009|p=325}} Based on this letter, Bowlus{{spaced ndash}}in contrast with the traditional view{{spaced ndash}}writes that Nitra was annexed by Great Moravia around 870.{{sfn|Bowlus|2009|pp=325-327}}

Duke G<U+00E9>za and King Solomon closely cooperated in the next years in fighting the Cumans and other enemies of the Kingdom of Hungary.{{sfn|Kosztolnyik|1981|p = 82}} For example, after the Czechs plundered the region of [[Tren<U+010D><U+00ED>n]], the King and the Duke invaded Bohemia and "laid waste with fire and sword almost the whole of Bohemia",<ref>''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 71.101), p. 118.</ref> according to the ''Illuminated Chronicle''.{{sfn|Kosztolnyik|1981|p = 82}} Relations between the king and his cousins deteriorated in the early 1070s.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p= 31}} Solomon invaded the territories east of the Tisza and defeated G<U+00E9>za at [[Kemej]] in February 1074.{{sfn|Steinh<U+00FC>bel|2011|p= 28}} However, in the decisive [[Battle of Mogyor<U+00F3>d|battle at Mogyor<U+00F3>d]] on 14 March 1074, Duke G<U+00E9>za defeated the king, who was forced to seek shelter in the kingdom's westernmost regions.{{sfn|Steinh<U+00FC>bel|2011|p= 28}} The ''Illuminated Chronicle'' says that during the battle, Duke G<U+00E9>za "with the troops from Nitria was stationed in the centre", while his brother Ladislaus "stood on the left flank"<ref>''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 84.121), p. 124.</ref> with the troops from [[Bihar County|Bihar]] (in present-day Romania) during the battle.{{sfn|Steinh<U+00FC>bel|2011|p= 28}} G<U+00E9>za was crowned king of Hungary, but Solomon continued to oppose him in the castles of [[Mosonmagyar<U+00F3>v<U+00E1>r|Moson]] and [[Pressburg]] (Bratislava, Slovakia).{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=27}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp= 32-33}} G<U+00E9>za granted his former duchy to his brother, Ladislaus.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p= 32}}{{sfn|Steinh<U+00FC>bel|2011|p= 28}}
