'''''Owl and Weasel''''' was a newsletter published in [[London]], England, by [[Games Workshop]] for [[Board Game|board gamers]], [[role-playing game]]rs and [[War Game|war gamers]]. It was published from February 1975 until April 1977, running 25 issues, and was edited by [[Steve Jackson (UK)|Steve Jackson]] and [[Ian Livingstone]]. It was superseded by ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'', which is published on a monthly basis {{As of|2008|lc=on}}.<ref>[http://uk.games-workshop.com/whitedwarf/who-are/ Games-Workshop.com]</ref>

The reasoning behind such a "cultishly-monikered"<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/fiction/article2151571.ece Timesonline.co.uk]</ref> choice of title has been stated to be a mystery by the co-editors, although [[anthropomorphism]] may have been a factor.<ref name="IL2">[http://www.eidosinteractive.co.uk/ian_livingstone/biography/part2.html Eidosinteractive.co.uk]</ref> Belatedly, in a 2009 interview Steve Jackson stated that "it represented the characteristics you need to be a good games player: wise like an owl and crafty like a weasel",<ref>[http://www.viceland.com/int/v16n12/htdocs/steve-jackson-ian-livingstone-283.php?page=1 Interview with Vice Magazine]</ref> although this explanation had not been given in any previous editorial or interview.

==History==
The publication was initially launched to run alongside their own business of producing hand-crafted wooden board games.  Because of this, there was a clear stated interest in print regarding "progressive games" including [[computer gaming]] and abstract games. The magazine issued a clear message for British producers to challenge the major game producing countries of the United States and Germany in what was, at the time, a relatively "traditional" marketplace.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Jackson | first = Steve | authorlink = Steve Jackson (UK) | title = Introducing... | journal =Owl and Weasel | issue = 1 | pages = 1 | publisher = Games Workshop | date = February 1975 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate =  }}</ref> Copies of early issues were also sent speculatively to anyone within the industry in order to help generate business and nurture longer-term connections and partnerships.<ref name="IL2"/>

[[Image:Owl and Weasel 6.gif|thumb|left|Owl and Weasel #6: [[Dungeons & Dragons]] special issue]]
The sixth issue, a key point in Games Workshop's early history, was released as a ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' special - a first in the UK - and issues #11 and #23 doubled as programmes for their early [[Games Day]]s, leading to coverage in [[The Times]] both of these events and of their magazine.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times|section=The Times Diary|articlename=Play time|day_of_week=Mon|date=December 22, 1975|page_number=10|issue=59584|column=G}}</ref><ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times|section=Shopping|articlename=The games big people play|day_of_week=Tue|date=December 14, 1976|page_number=16|issue=59886|column=C}}</ref>

The editors had expected that the publication would run on beyond issue #25 (in #23, for Games Day II, results for a competition were to be announced in #27),<ref>{{cite journal | last =  | first = | authorlink =  | title = Games at Games Day  | journal =Owl and Weasel | issue = 23 | pages = 3 | publisher = Games Workshop | date = February 1977 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate =  }}</ref> but it was soon after decided that a more professional image was required in order to move the company into a new "phase", in line with what [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] had carried out the previous year (when TSR transitioned their first periodical, ''The Strategic Review'', into the "glossy" [[roleplaying]] and [[wargaming]] magazines, [[Dragon (magazine)|''The Dragon'']] and ''Little Wars'').<ref>[http://www.eidosinteractive.co.uk/ian_livingstone/biography/part4.html Eidosinteractive.co.uk]</ref>

Although ''Owl and Weasel'''s circulation would be considered tiny by modern day standards (having only exceeded 200 "nicely", including 80 direct sales through hobby shops, by early 1976),<ref>{{cite journal | last =  | first = | authorlink =  | title = Editorial  | journal =Owl and Weasel | issue = 13 | pages = 2 | publisher = Games Workshop | date = February 1976 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate =  }}</ref> its influence in expanding what were previously niche hobbies into the general British marketplace dominated by traditional games was considerable, and it played a key role in setting up Games Workshop for an extended period of rapid growth.<ref>[http://synworld.t0.or.at/level2/gaming_reader/kulturellecodes/livingstone.htm OR.at]</ref><ref>[http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=145055 Computerandvideogames.com]</ref>

==Content==
The first few issues covered mostly traditional games and wargaming as well as running [[postal gaming|postal games]], attempting to create a games club and providing an alternative source for games news with a scope set deliberately as wide as possible.  Later issues provided coverage of fantasy and roleplaying games in general.

In the beginning, promotion of Games Workshop's own hand-crafted games boards was supplemented by reselling of [[wargaming|wargames]] and small press games.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Livingstone | first = Ian | authorlink = Ian Livingstone | title = Editorial  | journal =Owl and Weasel | issue = 3 | pages = 2 | publisher = Games Workshop | date = April 1975 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate =  }}</ref> Marketing of fantasy and science fiction games was expanded first by an exclusive deal with [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] in mid-1975 and further following the return of Livingstone and Jackson from [[Gen Con|GenCon IX]] in August 1976. There they had signed-up additional exclusive European distribution rights for many American publishers which were still at an early stage of their development&mdash;in part owing to the apparent lack of any other European companies at that convention.<ref name="sfx">[http://www.sfx.co.uk/page/sfx?entry=ian_livingstone_and_steve_jackson SFX.co.uk]</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Laws R.D.| year=2007| chapter=The Last of the Lake Geneva Years: 1975-1977| title=40 Years of Gen Con| publisher=Atlas Games| location=St. Paul, MN| isbn=1-58978-097-3 }}</ref> Traditional boardgames such as [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] and [[Scrabble]], whilst continuing to be covered in news items even after this expansion, were never sold through the pages of the magazine.

Although D&D, as the first modern-day commercial roleplaying game, had been introduced to Britain no later than Autumn 1974,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Buckell | first = Graham | authorlink =  | title = Letters  | journal =Owl and Weasel | issue = 7 | pages = 10 | publisher = Games Workshop | date = Aug 1975 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate =  }}</ref> such playing groups and societies as existed within the country were still on a local basis by 1975 or early 1976, sometimes co-existing with traditional wargaming societies. The aforementioned exclusive deal with TSR thus gave Games Workshop increased impetus to promote their flagship product by the creation of a nationwide D&D society which was carried out through the pages of ''Owl and Weasel''. The society was first proposed in issue #9, but did not commence until issue #12.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Livingstone| first = Ian | authorlink = Ian Livingstone | title = Letters  | journal =Owl and Weasel | issue = 12 | pages = 10 | publisher = Games Workshop | date = February 1975 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate =  }}</ref> This further increased the roleplaying content of the publication which had previously included variant rules and short essays on rules and gameplay. Although D&D society members provided tournaments for conventions such as Games Day, this arrangement was not run in as formal a manner as carried out, much later, by TSR's [[RPGA]].

In addition to promoting early postal D&D gaming,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Jackson| first = Steve | authorlink = Steve Jackson (UK) | title = History in the Making!  | journal =Owl and Weasel | issue = 8 | pages = 1 | publisher = Games Workshop | date = Sep 1975 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate =  }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Buckell| first = Graham | authorlink =  | title = Adventures in Dungeonland : Postal D&D  | journal =Owl and Weasel | issue = 20 | pages = 9 | publisher = Games Workshop | date = Nov 1976 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate =  }}</ref> other postal fantasy games were co-ordinated by veteran [[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]] aficionado [[Don Turnbull]], later of [[TSR, Inc.|TSR (UK)]], who had recently been the inaugural inductee to the [[Origins Game Fair|Origins]] Hall of Fame (for his work on postal gaming, having started the first British postal diplomacy magazine in 1969).<ref name="sfx"/><ref>[http://www.originsgamefair.com/about_us/history Originesgamefair.com]</ref> Further articles on game mechanics by Turnbull were accompanied by contributions from other well-known hobbyists such as Hartley Patterson and American, [[Lew Pulsipher]], as well as introducing new names whose works continued to be printed in Games Workshop's subsequent publication, ''White Dwarf''.

==Editors==
Editorial responsibilities were shared between [[Steve Jackson (UK)|Steve Jackson]] and [[Ian Livingstone]] on an issue-by-issue basis. Although the first couple of issues were edited by Jackson, later numbers were more usually edited by Livingstone. This trend continued through until he became the lead editor for the first 74 issues of ''White Dwarf''.
