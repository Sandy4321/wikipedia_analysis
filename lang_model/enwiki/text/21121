[[Image:Cyclol_reaction.png|thumb|350px|right|Figure 1: In the classic cyclol reaction, two peptide groups are linked by a N-C<U+2019> bond, converting the carbonyl oxygen into a hydoxyl group.  Although this reaction occurs in a few cyclic peptides, it is disfavored by [[free energy]], mainly because it eliminates the [[resonance stabilization]] of the [[peptide bond]].  This reaction was the basis of [[Dorothy Maud Wrinch|Dorothy Wrinch's]] cyclol model of proteins.]]
 
The '''cyclol hypothesis''' was the first [[tertiary structure|structural model]] of a [[protein folding|folded]], [[globular protein|globular]] [[protein]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Tiselius | first = A | authorlink = Arne Tiselius | year = 1939 | title = The Chemistry of Proteins and Amino Acids | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 8 | pages = 155&ndash;184}}</ref>  It was developed by [[Dorothy Maud Wrinch|Dorothy Wrinch]] in the late 1930's, and was based on three assumptions.  Firstly, the hypothesis assumes that two [[peptide bond|peptide groups]] can be crosslinked by a '''cyclol reaction''' (Figure 1); these crosslinks are ''covalent'' analogs of ''non-covalent'' [[hydrogen bond]]s between peptide groups.  These reactions have been observed in the [[ergoline|ergopeptides]] and other compounds.  Secondly, it assumes that, under some conditions, amino acids will naturally make the maximum possible number of cyclol crosslinks, resulting in '''cyclol molecules''' (Figure 2) and '''cyclol fabrics''' (Figure 3).  These cyclol molecules and fabrics have never been observed.  Finally, the hypothesis assumes that globular proteins have a [[tertiary structure]] corresponding to [[Platonic solid]]s and [[semiregular polyhedron|semiregular polyhedra]] formed of cyclol fabrics with no free edges.  Such "closed cyclol" molecules have also not been observed.

Although incorrect as a model for the [[protein structure|structure of globular proteins]], several elements of the cyclol model were later verified, such as the cyclol reaction itself and the hypothesis that [[hydrophobic interaction]]s are chiefly responsible for [[protein folding]].  The cyclol hypothesis stimulated many scientists to research questions in protein structure and chemistry, and was a precursor of the more accurate models hypothesized for the [[DNA|DNA double helix]] and [[secondary structure|protein secondary structure]].  The proposal and testing of the cyclol model also provides an excellent illustration of [[empirical]] [[falsifiability]] acting as part of the [[scientific method]].

==Historical context==

By the mid-1930's, [[analytical ultracentrifugation]] studies by [[Theodor Svedberg]] had shown that proteins had a well-defined chemical structure, and were not aggregations of small molecules.<ref name="svedberg_1929">{{cite journal | last = Svedberg | first = T | authorlink = Theodor Svedberg | year = 1929 | title = Mass and size of protein molecules | journal = Nature | volume = 123 | pages = 871}}</ref>  The same studies appeared to show that the molecular weight of proteins fell into a few well-defined classes related by integers,<ref name="svedberg_1934">{{cite journal | last = Svedberg | first = T | authorlink = Theodor Svedberg | year = 1934 | title = Sedimentation of molecules in centrifugal fields | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 14 | pages = 1&ndash;15}}</ref> such as ''M<sub>w</sub> = 2<sup>p</sup>3<sup>q</sup>''&nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|Da]], where ''p'' and ''q'' are nonnegative integers.<ref name="bergmann_niemann_1937">{{cite journal| last = Bergmann | first = M | coauthors = Niemann C | year = 1937 | title = On the structure of proteins: cattle hemoglobin, egg albumin, cattle fibrin, and gelatin | journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 118 | pages = 301&ndash;314}}</ref>  However, it was difficult to determine the exact molecular weight and number of amino acids in a protein.  Svedberg had also shown that a change in solution conditions could cause a protein to disassemble into small subunits, now known as a change in [[quaternary structure]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Svedberg | first = T | authorlink = Theodor Svedberg | year = 1930 | title = The pH Stability Regions of Proteins | journal = Transactions of the Faraday Society | volume = 26 | pages = 741&ndash;744}}</ref>  

The [[primary structure|chemical structure]] of [[protein]]s was still under debate at that time.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Fruton | first = JS | year = 1979 | title = Early theories of protein structure | journal = Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. | volume = 325 | pages = 1&ndash;18}}</ref>  The most accepted (and ultimately correct) hypothesis was that proteins are linear [[polypeptide]]s, i.e., unbranched [[polymer]]s of [[amino acid]]s linked by [[peptide bond]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hofmeister | first = F | authorlink = Franz Hofmeister | year = 1902 | title = <U+00DC>ber Bau und Gruppierung der Eiweissk<U+00F6>rper | journal = Ergebnisse der Physiologie | volume = 1 | pages = 759&ndash;802}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Fischer | first = E | authorlink = Emil Fischer | year = 1902 | title = <U+00DC>ber die Hydrolyse der Proteinstoffe | journal = Chemiker Zeitung | volume = 26 | pages = 939-940}}</ref>  However, a typical protein is remarkably long &mdash; hundreds of [[amino acid|amino-acid residues]] &mdash; and several distinguished scientists were unsure whether such long, linear [[macromolecule]]s could be stable in solution.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Fischer | first = E | authorlink = Emil Fischer | year = 1913 | title = Synthese von Depsiden, Flechtenstoffen und Gerbstoffen | journal = Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft | volume = 46 | pages = 3253&ndash;3289}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = S<U+00F8>rensen | first = SPL | authorlink = S.

Hence, alternative chemical models of proteins were considered, such as the diketopiperazine hypothesis of [[Emil Abderhalden]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Abderhalden | first = E | authorlink = Emil Abderhalden | year = 1924 | title = Diketopiperazines | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 12 | pages = 716}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Abderhalden | first = E | authorlink = Emil Abderhalden | coauthors = Komm E | year = 1924 | title = <U+00DC>ber die Anhydridstruktur der Proteine | journal = Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r physiologische Chemie | volume = 139 | pages = 181&ndash;204}}</ref> However, no alternative model had yet explained why proteins yield only amino acids and peptides upon hydrolysis and proteolysis.  As clarified by [[Kaj Ulrik Linderstrom-Lang|Linderstr<U+00F8>m-Lang]],<ref>{{cite journal | last = Linderstr<U+00F8>m-Lang | first = K | authorlink = Kaj Ulrik Linderstrom-Lang | coauthors = Hotchkiss RD, Johansen G | year = 1938 | title = Peptide Bonds in Globular Proteins | journal = Nature | volume = 142 | pages = 996}}</ref> these proteolysis data showed that [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured proteins]] were polypeptides, but no data had yet been obtained about the structure of folded proteins; thus, denaturation could involve a chemical change that converted folded proteins into polypeptides.

The process of [[protein]] [[denaturation]] (as distinguished from [[coagulation]]) had been discovered in 1910 by [[Harriette Chick]] and [[Charles James Martin|Charles Martin]],<ref>{{cite journal| last = Chick | first = H | authorlink = Harriette Chick | coauthors = [[Charles James Martin|Martin CJ]] | year = 1910 | title = On the "Heat" Coagulation of Proteins | journal = Journal of Physiology | volume = 40 | pages = 404&ndash;430}}<br />{{cite journal| last = Chick | first = H | authorlink = Harriette Chick | coauthors = [[Charles James Martin|Martin CJ]] | year = 1911 | title = On the "Heat" Coagulation of Proteins.

[[X-ray crystallography]] had just begun as a discipline in 1911, and had advanced relatively rapidly from simple salt crystals to crystals of complex molecules such as [[cholesterol]].  However, even the smallest proteins have over 1000 atoms, which makes determining their structure far more complex.  In 1934, [[Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin]] had taken crystallographic data on the structure of the small protein, [[insulin]], although the structure of that and other proteins were not solved until the late 1960's.  However, pioneering [[X-ray]] [[fiber diffraction]] data had been collected in the early 1930's for many natural [[fibrous protein]]s such as wool and hair by [[William Astbury]], who proposed rudimentary models of [[secondary structure]] elements such as the [[alpha helix]] and the [[beta sheet]].  

Since [[protein structure]] was so poorly understood in the 1930's, the physical interactions responsible for stabilizing that structure were likewise unknown.  [[William Astbury|Astbury]] hypothesized that the structure of [[fibrous protein]]s was stabilized by [[hydrogen bond]]s in [[beta sheet|<U+03B2>-sheet]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Astbury | first = WT | authorlink = William Astbury | year = 1931 | coauthors = Woods HJ | title = The Molecular Weight of Proteins | journal = Nature | volume = 127 | pages = 663&ndash;665 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last = Astbury | first = WT | authorlink = William Astbury | year = 1933 | title = Some Problems in the X-Ray Analysis of the Structure of Animal Hairs and Other Protein Fibres | journal = Transactions of the Faraday Society | volume = 29 | pages = 193&ndash;211}}</ref>  The idea that [[globular protein]]s are also stabilized by hydrogen bonds was proposed by [[Dorothy Jordan Lloyd]]<ref name="jordan_lloyd_1932">{{cite journal | last = Jordan Lloyd | first = D | authorlink = Dorothy Jordan Lloyd | year = 1932 | title = Colloidal Structure and its Biological Significance | journal = Biological Review | volume = 7 | pages = 254&ndash;273}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Jordan Lloyd | first = D | authorlink = Dorothy Jordan Lloyd | coauthors = Marriott | year = 1933 | title = Title unknown | journal = Transactions of the Faraday Society | volume = 29 | pages = 1228}}</ref> in 1932, and championed later by [[Alfred Mirsky]] and [[Linus Pauling]].<ref name="mirsky_pauling_1936" />  At a 1933 lecture by Astbury to the Oxford Junior Scientific Society, physicist [[Frederick Charles Frank|Frederick Frank]] suggested that the fibrous protein <U+03B1>-keratin might be stabilized by an alternative mechanism, namely, ''covalent'' crosslinking of the [[peptide bond]]s by the cyclol reaction above.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Astbury | first = WT | authorlink = William Astbury | year = 1936 | title = Unknown title | journal = Journal of the Textile Institute | volume = 27 | pages = 282&ndash;? }}</ref>  The cyclol crosslink draws the two peptide groups close together; the N and C atoms are separated by ~1.5&nbsp;[[Angstrom|<U+00C5>]], whereas they are separated by ~3&nbsp;[[Angstrom|<U+00C5>]] in a typical [[hydrogen bond]].  The idea intrigued [[J. D. Bernal]], who suggested it to the mathematician [[Dorothy Maud Wrinch|Dorothy Wrinch]] as possibly useful in understanding protein structure.

==Basic theory==

[[Image:Cyclol_6_molecule.png|thumb|right|300px|Figure 2: The alanine cyclol-6 molecule proposed by [[Dorothy Maud Wrinch|Dorothy Wrinch]] is a cyclic hexapeptide in which three [[peptide bond|peptide groups]] are fused by cyclol reactions into a central ring.  The three outer (unfused) peptide groups are not planar, but have dihedral angle <U+03C9>=60<U+00B0>.  The three red atoms in the central ring represent the hydroxyl groups formed by the cyclol reactions, whereas the three outer red atoms represent the oxygens of carbonyl groups.  The inner oxygen atoms are separated by only 2.45&nbsp;[[Angstrom|<U+00C5>]], which is extremely close even for [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen-bonded]] [[atom]]s.  This hypothetical molecule has not been observed in Nature.]]

[[Dorothy Maud Wrinch|Wrinch]] developed this suggestion into a full-fledged model of [[protein structure]].  The basic cyclol model was laid out in her first paper (1936).<ref>{{cite journal| last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | title = The Pattern of Proteins | year = 1936 | journal = Nature | volume = 137 | pages = 411&ndash;412}}</ref>  She noted the possibility that [[polypeptide]]s might cyclize to form closed rings ([[cyclic peptide|true]]) and that these rings might form internal crosslinks through the cyclol reaction (also true, although rare).  Assuming that the cyclol form of the [[peptide bond]] could be more stable than the amide form, Wrinch concluded that certain cyclic [[peptide]]s would naturally make the maximal number of cyclol bonds (such as '''cyclol 6''', Figure 2).  Such cyclol molecules would have hexagonal symmetry, if the [[chemical bond]]s were taken as having the same length, roughly 1.5&nbsp;[[Angstrom|<U+00C5>]]; for comparison, the N-C and C-C bonds have the lengths 1.42&nbsp;[[Angstrom|<U+00C5>]] and 1.54&nbsp;[[Angstrom|<U+00C5>]], respectively.  

These rings can be extended indefinitely to form a '''cyclol fabric''' (Figure 3).  Such fabrics exhibit a long-range, quasi-crystalline order that Wrinch felt was likely in proteins, since they must pack hundreds of residues densely.  Another interesting feature of such molecules and fabrics is that their [[amino acid|amino-acid]] side chains point axially upwards from only face; the opposite face has no side chains.  Thus, one face is completely independent of the [[primary sequence]] of the [[peptide]], which Wrinch conjectured might account for sequence-independent properties of proteins.  

In her initial article, Wrinch stated clearly that the cyclol model was merely a ''working hypothesis'', a potentially valid model of proteins that would have to be checked.  Her goals in this article and its successors were to propose a well-defined testable model, to work out the consequences of its assumptions and to make predictions that could be tested experimentally.  In these goals, she succeeded; however, within a few years, experiments and further modeling showed that the cyclol hypothesis was untenable as a model for globular proteins.

==Stabilizing energies==

[[Image:Cyclol_fabric_stick_CBside.png|thumb|left|350px|Figure 3: Stick model of the alanine cyclol fabric proposed by [[Dorothy Maud Wrinch|Dorothy Wrinch]].  The cyclol fabric is conceptually similar to a [[beta sheet]], but more uniform and laterally denser.  The fabric has large "lacunae" arranged in a hexagonal pattern, in which three C<sup><U+03B2></sup> atoms (shown in green) and three H<sup><U+03B1></sup> atoms (shown in white) converge on a (relatively) empty spot in the fabric.  The two sides of the fabric are not equivalent; all the C<sup><U+03B2></sup> atoms emerge from the same side, which is the "upper" side here. The red atoms represent hydroxyl groups (not carbonyl groups) and emerge (in sets of three) from both sides of the fabric; the blue atoms represent nitrogen.  This hypothetical structure has not been observed in Nature.]]

In two tandem Letters to the Editor (1936),<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1936 | title = Energy of Formation of 'Cyclol' Molecules | journal = Nature | volume = 138 | pages = 241&ndash;242}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Frank | first = FC | authorlink = Frederick Charles Frank | year = 1936 | title = Energy of Formation of 'Cyclol' Molecules | journal = Nature | volume = 138 | pages = 242}}</ref> Wrinch and Frank addressed the question of whether the cyclol form of the peptide group was indeed more stable than the amide form.  A relatively simple calculation showed that the cyclol form is significantly ''less'' stable than the amide form.  Therefore, the cyclol model would have to be abandoned unless a compensating source of energy could be identified.  Initially, Frank proposed that the cyclol form might be stabilized by better interactions with the surrounding solvent; later, Wrinch and [[Irving Langmuir]] hypothesized that hydrophobic association of nonpolar sidechains provides stabilizing energy to overcome the energetic cost of the cyclol reactions.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Langmuir | first = I | authorlink = Irving Langmuir | coauthors = [[Dorothy Maud Wrinch|Wrinch DM]] | year = 1939 | title = Nature of the Cyclol Bond | journal = Nature | volume = 143 | pages = 49&ndash;52}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Langmuir | first = I | authorlink = Irving Langmuir | year = 1939 | title = The Structure of Proteins | journal = Proceedings of the Physical Society of London | volume = 51 | pages = 592&ndash;612}}</ref>  

The lability of the cyclol bond was seen as an ''advantage'' of the model, since it provided a natural explanation for the properties of [[denaturation]]; reversion of cyclol bonds to their more stable amide form would open up the structure and allows those bonds to be attacked by [[protease]]s, consistent with experiment.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1938 | title = On the Hydration and Denaturation of Proteins | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume = 25 | pages = 705&ndash;739}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1936 | title = Hydration and Denaturation of Proteins | journal = Nature | volume = 142 | pages = 260}}</ref>  Early studies showed that proteins [[denaturation|denatured]] by [[pressure]] are often in a different state than the same proteins denatured by high [[temperature]], which was interpreted as possibly supporting the cyclol model of denaturation.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Dow | first = RB | coauthors = Matthews JE, Jr. and Thorp WTS | year = 1940 | title = The Effect of High Pressure Treatment on the Physiological Activity of Insulin | journal = American Journal of Physiology | volume = 131 | pages = 382&ndash;387}}</ref>

The Langmuir-Wrinch hypothesis of hydrophobic stabilization shared in the downfall of the cyclol model, owing mainly to the influence of [[Linus Pauling]], who favored the hypothesis that protein structure was stabilized by [[hydrogen bond]]s.  Another twenty years had to pass before hydrophobic interactions were recognized as the chief driving force in protein folding.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Kauzmann | first = W | authorlink = Walter Kauzmann | year = 1959 | title = Some Factors in the Interpretation of Protein Denaturation | journal = Advances in Protein Chemistry | volume = 14 | pages = 1&ndash;63}}</ref>

==Steric complementarity==

In her third paper on cyclols (1936), <ref>{{cite journal| last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | title = Structure of Proteins and of Certain Physiologically Active Compounds | year = 1936 | journal = Nature | volume = 138 | pages = 651&ndash;652}}</ref> Wrinch noted that many "physiologically active" substances such as [[steroid]]s are composed of fused hexagonal rings of carbon atoms and, thus, might be [[steric complementarity|sterically complementary]] to the face of cyclol molecules without the [[amino acid|amino-acid]] side chains.  Wrinch proposed that steric complementarity was one of chief factors in determining whether a small molecule would bind to a protein.  

Wrinch speculated that proteins are responsible for the synthesis of all biological molecules.  Noting that cells digest their proteins only under extreme starvation conditions, Wrinch further speculated that life could not exist without proteins.

==Hybrid models==

From the beginning, the cyclol reaction was considered as a covalent analog of the [[hydrogen bond]].  Therefore, it was natural to consider hybrid models with both types of bonds.  This was the subject of Wrinch's fourth paper on the cyclol model (1936),<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | coauthors = [[Dorothy Jordan Lloyd|Jordan Lloyd D]] | year = 1936 | title = The Hydrogen Bond and the Structure of Proteins | journal = Nature | volume = 138 | pages = 758&ndash;759}}</ref> written together with [[Dorothy Jordan Lloyd]], who first proposed that globular proteins are stabilized by hydrogen bonds.<ref name="jordan_lloyd_1932" />  A follow-up paper was written in 1937 that referenced other researchers on hydrogen bonding in proteins, such as [[Maurice Loyal Huggins]] and [[Linus Pauling]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1937 | title = Nature of the Linkage in Proteins | journal = Nature | volume = 139 | pages = 718}}</ref>

Wrinch also wrote a paper with [[William Astbury]], noting the possibility of a keto-enol isomerization of the >C<sup><U+03B1></sup>H<sup><U+03B1></sup> and an amide carbonyl group >C=O, producing a crosslink >C<sup><U+03B1></sup>-C(OH<sup><U+03B1></sup>)< and again converting the oxygen to a hydroxyl group.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Astbury | first = WT | authorlink = William Astbury | coauthors = [[Dorothy Maud Wrinch|Wrinch DM]] | year = 1937 | title = The Hydrogen Bond and the Structure of Proteins | journal = Nature | volume = 139 | pages = 798}}</ref>  Such reactions could yield five-membered rings, whereas the classic cyclol hypothesis produces six-membered rings.  This keto-enol crosslink hypothesis was not developed much further.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = D | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | title = The Fabric Theory of Protein Structure | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume = 30 | pages = 64&ndash;67}}</ref>

==Space-enclosing fabrics==

[[Image:Cyclol_C1_molecule_lacuna.png|thumb|right|350px|Figure 4: Stick model of the cyclol C<sub>1</sub> protein structure proposed by [[Dorothy Maud Wrinch|Dorothy Wrinch]].  The molecule is a truncated tetrahedron composed of four planar cyclol fabrics, each surrounding one lacuna (48 residues), and joined together pairwise by four residues along each edge (two residues at each corner).  Thus, this molecule has 72 [[amino acid|amino-acid]] residues altogether.   It is viewed here "face-on", i.e., looking into the lacuna of one cyclol fabric.  The side chains (taken here as alanine) all point into the interior of this "cage-like" structure.  This hypothetical structure has not been observed in Nature.]]

In her fifth paper on cyclols (1937),<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1937 | title = The Cyclol Theory and the 'Globular' Proteins | journal = Nature | volume = 139 | pages = 972&ndash;973}}</ref> Wrinch identified the conditions under which two planar cyclol fabrics could be joined to make an angle between their planes while respecting the chemical bond angles.  She identified a mathematical simplification, in which the non-planar six-membered rings of atoms can be represented by planar "median hexagon"s made from the midpoints of the chemical bonds.  This "median hexagon" representation made it easy to see that the cyclol fabric planes can be joined correctly if the [[dihedral angle]] between the planes equals the tetrahedral bond angle <U+03B4> = arccos(-1/3) <U+2248> 109.47<U+00B0>.  

A large variety of closed polyhedra meeting this criterion can be constructed, of which the simplest are the [[truncated tetrahedron]], the [[truncated octahedron]], and the [[octahedron]], which are [[Platonic solid]]s or [[semiregular polyhedron|semiregular polyhedra]].  Considering the first series of "closed cyclols" (those modeled on the truncated tetrahedron), Wrinch showed that their number of amino acids [[quadratic growth|increased quadratically]] as 72''n''<sup>2</sup>, where ''n'' is the index of the closed cyclol ''C<sub>n</sub>''.  Thus, the ''C<sub>1</sub>'' cyclol has 72 residues, the ''C<sub>2</sub>'' cyclol has 288 residues, etc.  Preliminary experimental support for this prediction came from Bergmann and Niemann,<ref name="bergmann_niemann_1937" /> whose amino-acid analyses suggested that proteins were comprised of integer multiples of 288 [[amino acid|amino-acid]] residues (''n''=2).  More generally, the cyclol model of globular proteins accounted for the early [[analytical ultracentrifugation]] results of [[Theodor Svedberg]], which suggested that the [[molecular weight]]s of proteins fell into a few classes related by integers.<ref name="svedberg_1929" /><ref name="svedberg_1934" />

The cyclol model was consistent with the general properties then attributed to folded proteins.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1947 | title = The Native Protein | journal = Science | volume = 106 | pages = 73&ndash;76}}</ref>  (1) Centrifugation studies had shown that folded proteins were significantly denser than water (~1.4&nbsp;[[gram|g]]/[[liter|mL]]) and, thus, tightly packed; Wrinch assumed that dense packing should imply ''regular'' packing.  (2) Despite their large size, some proteins crystallize readily into symmetric crystals, consistent with the idea of symmetric faces that match up upon association.  (3) Proteins bind metal ions; since metal-binding sites must have specific bond geometries (e.g., octahedral), it was plausible to assume that the entire protein also had similarly crystalline geometry.  (4) As described above, the cyclol model provided a simple ''chemical'' explanation of [[denaturation]] and the difficulty of cleaving folded proteins with proteases. (5) Proteins were assumed to be responsible for the synthesis of all biological molecules, including other proteins.  Wrinch noted that a fixed, uniform structure would be useful for proteins in templating their own synthesis, analogous to the [[James D. Watson|Watson]]-[[Francis Crick]] concept of DNA templating its own replication.  Given that many biological molecules such as [[carbohydrate|sugars]] and [[sterol]]s have a hexagonal structure, it was plausible to assume that their synthesizing proteins likewise had a hexagonal structure.

Wrinch summarized her model and the supporting molecular-weight experimental data in three review articles.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1937 | title = On the Pattern of Proteins | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society | volume = A160 | pages = 59&ndash;86}}<br />{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1937 | title = The Cyclol Hypothesis and the "Globular" Proteins | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society | volume = A161 | pages = 505&ndash;524}}<br />{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1938 | title = On the Molecular Weights of the Globular Proteins | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume = 26 | pages = 313&ndash;332}}</ref>

==Predicted protein structures==

Having proposed a model of globular proteins, Wrinch investigated whether it was consistent with the available structural data.  She hypothesized that bovine tuberculin protein (523) was a ''C<sub>1</sub>'' closed cyclol consisting of 72 residues<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1939 | title = The Tuberculin Protein TBU-Bovine (523) | journal = Nature | volume = 144 | pages = 77}}</ref> and that the digestive [[enzyme]] [[pepsin]] was a ''C<sub>2</sub>'' closed cyclol of 288 residues.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1937 | title = On the structure of pepsin | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume = 24 | pages = 940}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1938 | title = Structure of Pepsin | journal = Nature | volume = 142 | pages = 217}}</ref>  These residue-number predictions were difficult to verify, since the methods then available to measure the mass of [[protein]]s were inaccurate, such as [[analytical ultracentrifugation]] and chemical methods.

Wrinch also predicted that [[insulin]] was a ''C<sub>2</sub>'' closed cyclol consisting of 288 residues.  Limited X-ray crystallographic data were available for [[insulin]] which Wrinch interpreted as "confirming" her model.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1937 | title = On the Structure of Insulin | journal = Science | volume = 85 | pages = 566&ndash;567}}<br />{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1937 | title = On the Structure of Insulin | journal = Transactions of the Faraday Society | volume = 33 | pages = 1368&ndash;1380}}<br />{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch |  year = 1938 | title = The Structure of the Insulin Molecule | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 60 | pages = 2005&ndash;2006}}<br />{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch |  year = 1938 | title = The Structure of the Insulin Molecule | journal = Science | volume = 88 | pages = 148&ndash;149}}<br />{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | coauthors = [[Irving Langmuir|Langmuir I]] |  year = 1938 | title = The Structure of the Insulin Molecule | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 60 | pages = 2247&ndash;2255}}<br />{{cite journal | last = Langmuir | first = I | authorlink = Irving Langmuir | coauthors = [[Dorothy Maud Wrinch|Wrinch DM]] | year = 1939 | title = A Note on the Structure of Insulin | journal = Proceedings of the Physical Society of London | volume = 51 | pages = 613&ndash;624}}</ref>  However, this interpretation drew rather severe criticism for being premature.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Bragg | first = WL | authorlink = William Lawrence Bragg |  year = 1939 | title = Patterson Diagrams in Crystal Analysis | journal = Nature | volume = 143 | pages = 73&ndash;74}}<br />{{cite journal | last = Bernal | first = JD | authorlink = J.

Finally, proteins were known to contain [[proline]] in significant quantities (typically 5%); since proline lacks the amide hydrogen and its nitrogen already forms three covalent bonds, proline seems incapable of the cyclol reaction and of being incorporated into a cyclol fabric.  An encyclopedic summary of the chemical and structural evidence against the cyclol model was given by Pauling and Niemann.<ref name = "pauling_niemann_1939">{{cite journal | last = Pauling | first = L | authorlink = Linus Pauling | coauthors = Niemann C | year = 1939 | title = The Structure of Proteins | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 61 | pages = 1860&ndash;1867|doi =10.1021/ja01876a065}}</ref>  Moreover, a supporting piece of evidence &mdash; the result that all proteins contain an integer multiple of 288 [[amino acid|amino-acid]] residues<ref name="bergmann_niemann_1937" /> &mdash; was likewise shown to be incorrect in 1939.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hotchkiss | first = RD | year = 1939 | title = The Determination of Peptide Bonds in Crystalline Lactoglobulin | journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 131 | pages = 387&ndash;395}}</ref>

Wrinch replied to the steric-clash, free-energy, chemical and residue-number criticisms of the cyclol model.  On steric clashes, she noted that small deformations of the bond angles and bond lengths would allow these steric clashes to be relieved, or at least reduced to a reasonable level.<ref name="Wrinch_JACS_1941">{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1941 | title = The Geometrical Attack on Protein Structure | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 63 | pages = 330&ndash;33}}</ref>  She noted that distances between non-bonded groups within a single molecule can be shorter than expected from their [[van der Waals radius|van der Waals radii]], e.g., the 2.93&nbsp;[[Angstrom|<U+00C5>]] distance between methyl groups in hexamethylbenzene.  Regarding the free-energy penalty for the cyclol reaction, Wrinch disagreed with Pauling's calculations and stated that too little was known of intramolecular energies to rule out the cyclol model on that basis alone.<ref name="Wrinch_JACS_1941" />  In reply to the chemical criticisms, Wrinch suggested that the model compounds and simple bimolecular reactions studied need not pertain to the cyclol model, and that steric hindrance may have prevented the surface hydroxyl groups from reacting.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1940 | title = The Cyclol Hypothesis | journal = Nature | volume = 145 | pages = 669&ndash;670}}</ref>  On the residue-number criticism, Wrinch extended her model to allow for other numbers of residues.  In particular, she produced a "minimal" closed cyclol of only 48 residues,<ref name="wrinch_science_1948">{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1948 | title = The Native Proteins as Polycondensations of Amino Acids | journal = Science | volume = 107 | pages = 445&ndash;446}}</ref> and, on that (incorrect) basis, may have been the first to suggest that the [[insulin]] monomer had a molecular weight of roughly 6000&nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|Da]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1948 | title = Skeletal Units in Protein Crystals | journal = Science | volume = 115 | pages = 356&ndash;357}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1948 | title = Molecules of the Insulin Structure | journal = Science | volume = 116 | pages = 562&ndash;564}}</ref> 

Therefore, she maintained that the cyclol model of globular proteins was still potentially viable<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1939 | title = The Structure of the Globular Proteins | journal = Nature | volume = 143 | pages = 482&ndash;483}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1939 | title = The Cyclol Theory and the Structure of Insulin | journal = Nature | volume = 143 | pages = 763&ndash;764}}</ref> and even proposed the cyclol fabric as a component of the [[cytoskeleton]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wrinch | first = DM | authorlink = Dorothy Maud Wrinch | year = 1939 | title = Native Proteins, Flexible Frameworks and Cytoplasmic Organization | journal = Nature | volume = 150 | pages = 270&ndash;271}}</ref>  However, most protein scientists ceased to believe in it and Wrinch turned her scientific attention to mathematical problems in [[X-ray crystallography]], to which she contributed significantly.  One exception was physicist Gladys Anslow, Wrinch's colleague at [[Smith College]], who studied the [[ultraviolet]] [[absorption]] spectra of proteins and peptides in the 1940's and allowed for the possibility of cyclols in interpreting her results.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Anslow | first = GA  | year = 1942 | title = Bond Energies in Some Protein Fabrics and Side Chains | journal = Physical Review | volume = 61 | pages = 547}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Anslow | first = GA  | year = 1945 | title = Ultraviolet Spectra of Biologically Important Molecules | journal = Journal of Applied Physics | volume = 16 | pages = 41&ndash;49}}</ref>  As the [[primary structure|sequence]] of [[insulin]] began to be determined by [[Frederick Sanger]], Anslow published a three-dimensional cyclol model with sidechains,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Anslow | first = GA |  year = 1953 | title = The Sites of the Amino-Acid Residues on a Cyclol Model of Insulin | journal = Journal of Chemical Physics | volume = 21 | pages = 2083&ndash;2084}}</ref> based on the backbone of Wrinch's  1948 "minimal cyclol" model.<ref name="wrinch_science_1948" />

The downfall of the overall cyclol model generally led to a rejection of its elements; one notable exception was [[J. D. Bernal]]'s short-lived acceptance of the Langmuir-Wrinch hypothesis that [[protein folding]] is driven by hydrophobic association.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Bernal | first = JD | authorlink = J. D.

Clarification of the modern terminology is appropriate.  The classic cyclol reaction is the addition of the NH amine of a [[peptide bond|peptide group]] to the C=O carbonyl group of another; the resulting compound is now called an '''azacyclol'''.  By analogy, an '''oxacyclol''' is formed when an OH hydroxyl group is added to a peptidyl carbonyl group.  Likewise, a '''thiacyclol''' is formed by adding an SH thiol moiety to a peptidyl carbonyl group.<ref name="Wieland1991">Wieland T and Bodanszky M, ''The World of Peptides'', Springer Verlag, pp.193-198.

==Illustration of the scientific method==

The cyclol model of protein structure is an excellent example of [[empirical]] [[falsifiability]] acting as part of the [[scientific method]].  An original [[hypothesis]] is made that accounts for unexplained experimental observations; the consequences of this hypothesis are worked out, leading to predictions that are tested by experiment.  In this case, the key hypothesis was that the cyclol form of the peptide group could be favored over the amide form.  This hypothesis led to the predictions of the cyclol-6 molecule and the cyclol fabric, which in turn suggested the model of semi-regular polyhedra for globular proteins.  A key testable prediction was that a folded protein's carbonyl groups should be largely converted to hydroxyl groups; however, spectroscopic and chemical experiments showed that this prediction was incorrect.  The cyclol model also predicts a high lateral density of amino acids in folded proteins and in films that does not agree with experiment.  Hence, the cyclol model could be rejected and the search begun for new hypotheses of [[protein structure]], such as the models of the [[alpha helix]] proposed in the 1940's and 1950's.    

It is sometimes argued that the cyclol hypothesis should never have been advanced,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Kauzmann | first = W | authorlink = Walter Kauzmann | year = 1993 | title = Reminiscences from a life in protein physical chemistry | journal = Protein Science | volume = 2 | pages = 671&ndash;691}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Tanford | first = C | authorlink = Charles Tanford | coauthors = Reynolds J | year = 2001 | title = Nature's robots: A history of proteins | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford}}</ref> because of its ''a priori'' flaws, e.g., its steric clashes, its inability to accommodate [[proline]] and the high [[free energy]] disfavoring the cyclol reaction itself.  Although such flaws rendered the cyclol hypothesis ''implausible'', they did not make it ''impossible''.  The cyclol model was the first well-defined structure proposed for globular proteins, and too little was then known of intramolecular forces and protein structure to reject it immediately. It neatly explained several general properties of proteins and accounted for then-anomalous experimental observations.  Although generally incorrect, some elements of the cyclol theory were eventually  verified, such as the cyclol reactions and the role of [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic interactions]] in [[protein folding]].  A useful comparison is the [[Bohr model]] of the [[hydrogen]] [[atom]], which was considered implausible from its inception, even by its creator,<ref>{{cite book | last = Pais | first = A | authorlink = Abraham Pais | year = 1986 | title = Inward Bound: Of Matter and Forces in the Physical World | publisher = Oxford University Press}}<br />{{cite journal | last = Bohr | first = N | authorlink = Niels Bohr | title=[http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Bohr/Bohr-1913a.html On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules (Part 1 of 3)] | journl=Philosophical Magazine | year=1913 | volume=26 | pages=1&ndash;25}}<br />{{cite journal | last = Bohr | first = N | authorlink = Niels Bohr | title=On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules, Part II Systems Containing Only a Single Nucleus | journal=Philosophical Magazine | year=1913 | volume=26 | pages=476-502}}<br />{{cite journal | last = Bohr | first = N | authorlink = Niels Bohr | title=On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules, Part III | journal=Philosophical Magazine | year=1913 | volume=26 | pages=857-875}}<br />{{cite journal | last = Bohr | first = N | authorlink = Niels Bohr | title=The spectra of helium and hydrogen | journal=Nature | year=1914 | volume=92 | pages=231-232}}</ref> yet led the way to the ultimately correct theory of [[quantum mechanics]].  Similarly, [[Linus Pauling]] proposed a well-defined model of [[DNA]]<ref>{{cite journal | last = Pauling | first = L | authorlink = Linus Pauling | coauthors = Corey RB | year = 1953 | title = A proposed structure for the nucleic acids | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Science | volume = 39 | pages = 84&ndash;97}}</ref> that was likewise implausible yet thought-provoking to other investigators.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Franklin | first = RE | authorlink = Rosalind Franklin | coauthors = [[Raymond Gosling|Gosling R]] | year = 1953 | title = Molecular configuration of sodium thymonucleate | journal = Nature | volume = 171 | pages = 740-741}}</ref><ref name = "watson_crick_1953">{{cite journal | last = Watson | first = JD | authorlink = James D. Watson | coauthors = [[Francis Crick|Crick F]] | year = 1953 | title = Molecular structure of nucleic acids: A structure for deoxyribonucleic acid | journal = Nature | volume = 171 | pages = 737-738}}</ref> The cyclol story is an example of where an area of science progressed by formulating a well-defined hypothesis, testing it and eliminating it as incorrect.

Conversely, the cyclol model is an excellent example of an incorrect scientific theory of great [[symmetry]] and [[beauty]], two qualities that can be regarded as signs of "obviously true" scientific theories.  For example, the [[James D. Watson|Watson]]-[[Francis Crick|Crick]] [[double helix]] model of [[DNA]]<ref name="watson_crick_1953" /> is sometimes said to "obvious" because of its plausible [[hydrogen bond]]ing and symmetry; nevertheless, other, less symmetrical structures of DNA are favored under different conditions.<ref>{{cite book | last = Saenger | first = W | year = 1988 | title = Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure | publisher = Springer Verlag}}</ref>  Similarly, the beautiful theory of [[general relativity]] was considered by  [[Albert Einstein]] as not needing experimental verification; yet even this theory will require revision for consistency with [[quantum field theory]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Pais | first = A. | authorlink = Abraham Pais | year = 1982 | title = Subtle is the Lord: The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein | publisher = Oxford University Press }}</ref>  The example of the cyclol model illustrates that all scientific theories, even the most beautiful and symmetrical, must be tested by experiment and that no theory is obviously true ''a priori'', only more plausible.
