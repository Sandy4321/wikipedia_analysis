'''Saint Paulus of Verdun''' (576-648) was a [[bishop]] of [[Bishopric of Verdun|Verdun]] in the [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] region of France from 630<ref name=OSVS>Matthew Bunson and Margaret Bunson. ''Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Saints.'' Second Edition. Our Sunday Visitor, 2014. p. 651.</ref> until his death in 647 or 648.

Paulus was the son of a wealthy family &ndash; his name suggests that he was part of the old [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] aristocracy. According to [[St Augustine's Abbey, Ramsgate|St Augustine Abbey]]'s ''Book of Saints,'' Paulus is said to have been the brother of Saint [[Germanus of Paris]].<ref>The Benedictine Monks of [[St Augustine's Abbey, Ramsgate]] (Comp.). ''THE BOOK OF SAINTS: A Dictionary of Servants of God Canonised by the Catholic Church: Extracted from the Roman and Other Martyrologies.'' London: A & C Black. Ltd., 1921. p. 211.</ref> 

He became a [[Anchorite|hermit]] and spent time on Paulsberg (lat: ''Mons Cebenna'')  across the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] from [[Trier]], in the [[Vosges|Vosges mountains]]. 

Later he joined the [[Tholey Abbey|monastery at Tholey]] in what is now [[Saarland]].  There he had charge of the school and is said to have become the second [[abbot]]. His tenure as abbot continued from 626 to 643/647.<ref>{{de icon}} ''[http://www.abtei-tholey.de/geschichte_abtliste.html Abtliste: Paulus (Bischof von Verdun)].''

He was named the [[Bishopric of Verdun|bishop of Verdun]] about 630 by King [[Dagobert I]].<ref name=OSVS/> According to his biography he was made bishop against his will due to the influence of one of his students, [[Adalgisel Grimo]]. Reportedly he found the diocese in a very poor financial state and was aided by gifts from Adalgisel and the Frankish King of [[Austrasia]].<ref name=DCB>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=William|last2=Wace|first2=Henry|title=A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines, vol 4|year=1887|publisher=Little, Brown & Company|page=271|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=e3DYAAAAMAAJ&lpg=PA271&ots=50FfMfG6-0&dq=paulus%20of%20verdun&pg=PA271#v=onepage&q=paulus%20of%20verdun&f=false}}</ref>

After his death Paulus was buried in the church of St. Saturninus in Verdun, which he had built and which was later renamed St. Paul's after him.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paulus von Verdun|url=http://www.heiligenlexikon.de/BiographienP/Paulus_von_Verdun.htm|work=<U+00D6>kumenisches Heiligenlexikon|accessdate=April 25, 2013}}</ref>

Paulus's remains were later [[Translation (relic)|translated]] to a new monastery that was founded by Bishop Viefrid from 970-973 and was dedicated to him. The [[:fr:Abbaye Saint-Paul de Verdun|Abbey of Saint-Paul de Verdun]] was originally occupied by [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictines]], but in 1135 by [[Premonstratensians]], and was finally destroyed in 1552.<ref>Goyau, Georges.

==Legend==
According to a legend related by Bertarius of Verdun, one day Paulus was working in the bakery in the Abbey of Tholey when the oven malfunctioned.  He feared that the bread would not be ready in time for meals, so he climbed into the burning oven in full habit, cleaned it with his hood, arranged the loaves to be baked, and later emerged from the oven with the fully baked loaves.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dilon|first=John|title=Feasts and Saints of the Day: Feb. 8|url=https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=medieval-religion;100f1d8c.1202|accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Bertarius Virdunensis|title=Historia brevis episcoporum Virdunensium|year=916|url=http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000871_00044.html}}</ref>

Because of this legend, Paulus became the patron saint of bakers and pastry chefs of Verdun.  On his feast day the "bread of Saint Paul" was distributed annually on the streets of Verdun. 

The ''[[Roman Martyrology]]'' states that he was renowned for [[Thaumaturgy|miracles]].<ref>''[[:iarchive:romanmartyrology00cathuoft|The Roman Martyrology]].'' Transl. by the Archbishop of Baltimore.

==Monuments==
The [[:fr:Abbaye Saint-Paul de Verdun|Abbey of Saint-Paul de Verdun]] that was founded by Bishop Viefrid from 970-973 was dedicated to him.

In addition, the ''"Paul-Cross"'' was erected in stone a few kilometers from Verdun, at a place called "Le Rozelier". The bishop represented there was recognizable as Saint Paulus from the bread rolls that he is holding. The plaque on this monuments reads (in capital letters): 

<blockquote>"Les moines de Tholey emport<U+00E8>rent dans leur abbaye sarroise le corps de saint Paul, <U+00E9>v<U+00EA>que de Verdun, ancien moine de Tholey (fin de ixe si<U+00E8>cle), afin de le soustraire <U+00E0> l'invasion normande.

The abbey of Saint-Vanne de Verdun established a priory there in the 12th century.
