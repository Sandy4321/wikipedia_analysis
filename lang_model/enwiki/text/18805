'''Dian Fossey'''  ({{IPAc-en|d|a<U+026A>|<U+02C8>|<U+00E6>|n|_|<U+02C8>|f|<U+0252>|s|i}}; January 16, 1932 <U+2013> c. December 26, 1985)<!--full dates in infobox, per MOS--> was an American [[Ethology|zoologist]] who undertook an extensive study of [[gorilla]] groups over a period of 18 years. She studied them daily in the mountain forests of [[Rwanda]], initially encouraged to work there by famous [[anthropologist]] [[Louis Leakey]]. Her 1983 book, ''[[Gorillas in the Mist (book)|Gorillas in the Mist]]'', combines her scientific study of the [[mountain gorilla]] at [[Karisoke Research Center]] with her own personal story. Fossey was murdered in 1985; the case remains open.<ref>Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume 5: Completing the Twentieth Century by Susan Ware and Stacy Braukman P. 221, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study - (2004) ISBN 0-674-01488-X</ref>

Called one of the foremost primatologists in the world while she was alive, Fossey, along with [[Jane Goodall]] and [[Birut<U+0117> Galdikas]], were the so-called [[The Trimates|Trimates]], a group of three prominent researchers on primates (Fossey on gorillas; Goodall on chimpanzees; and Galdikas on orangutans) sent by Leakey to study great apes in their natural environments.<ref name="NYT 5.1.81">{{Cite news|last=Robertson|first=Nan|year=1981|month=May|title=Three Who Have Chosen a Life in the Wild|periodical=[[The New York Times]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/01/style/three-who-have-chosen-a-life-in-the-wild.html|department=B|page=4}}</ref><ref name="nytimes 7.15.90">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/15/books/some-primates-weren-t-to-be-trusted.html?scp=1&sq=galdikas%20fossey%20goodall&st=cse|title=Some Primates Weren't Meant To Be Trusted|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2010-07-08 | first1=Delta | last1=Willis | date=July 15, 1990}}</ref>

==Life and career==
Dian Fossey was born in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] to George E. Fossey III, an insurance agent, and Kathryn "Kitty" (Kidd) Fossey, a fashion model.<ref name=webster>{{cite web|url=http://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/fossey.html|title=Dian Fossey|publisher=Webster.edu|accessdate=2009-12-14}}</ref> Her father was a [[US Navy]] sailor.

Her father tried to keep in contact, but her mother discouraged it, and all contact was subsequently lost.<ref name=webster/> Dian<U+2019>s stepfather, Richard Price, never took in Dian as his own child.

Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 28 Feb. 2013.</ref> Her love for animals began with her first pet goldfish and continued throughout her entire life.<ref name="name" /> At age six, she began [[Equestrianism|horse riding]], earning a letter from her school; by her graduation in 1954, Fossey had established herself as an [[Equestrianism|equestrienne]]. 

===Education===
Educated at [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell High School]], following the guidance of her stepfather she enrolled in a business course at the [[College of Marin]]. However, spending her summer on a ranch in [[Montana]] at age 19 rekindled her love of animals, and she enrolled in a pre-[[veterinary]] course in biology at the [[University of California, Davis]]. In defiance to her stepfather<U+2019>s wishes that she attend a business school, Dian desired to spend her professional life working with animals. As a consequence, Dian<U+2019>s parents failed to give her any substantial amount of financial support throughout her adult life.<ref name="name" /> She supported herself by working as a clerk at [[White Front]] (a department store), doing other clerking and laboratory work, and labouring as a [[machinist]] in a factory. 

Although Fossey had always been an exemplary student, she had difficulties with base sciences including [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], and failed her second year of the program. She transferred to [[San Jose State University|San Jose State College]] to study [[occupational therapy]], receiving her [[bachelor's degree]] in 1954. Initially following her college major, Fossey began a career in [[occupational therapy]]. She interned at various hospitals in California and worked with [[tuberculosis]] patients.<ref name=GFDFL>{{cite web|url=http://www.gorillafund.org/dian_fossey/dian_fossey_life.php|title=Dian Fossey Life|publisher=Gorilla Fund|accessdate=2009-12-14}}</ref> Dian Fossey spent the beginning part of her career as an occupational therapist at [[Kosair Crippled Children<U+2019>s Hospital]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] in 1956. She directed the occupational therapy department there. 

Her shy and reserved personality allowed her to work well with the children at the hospital.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Kenneth|title=The Scribener Encyclopedia|year=1998|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|pages=294<U+2013>296}}</ref> She continued to work there, and eventually another worker allowed her to live with and become part of their family. Fossey lived on a farm and worked with the livestock on a daily basis. Whilst there she experienced an inclusive family atmosphere that was missing for most of her life, through the Henry family who owned the farm.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives|year=1998|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|page=294|editor=Kenneth T.

Jackson, Karen Markoe, and Arnold Markoe</ref>

===Interest in Africa===
Fossey became friends with Mary White "Gaynee" Henry, secretary to the chief administrator at the hospital and wife of one of the doctors, Michael J. Henry.<ref name=webster/>  Fossey turned down an offer to join the couple on an African tour due to lack of finances,<ref name=webster/> but in 1963 she borrowed $8,000 (one year's salary), and went on a seven-week visit to Africa.<ref name=innominate/>

In September 1963, she arrived in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]].<ref name=GFDFL/> While there, she met actor [[William Holden]], owner of [[Treetops Hotel]],<ref name=innominate/> who introduced her to her safari guide, John Alexander.<ref name=innominate/> Alexander became her guide for the next seven weeks through Kenya, [[Tanzania]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. Alexander's route included visits to [[Tsavo]], Africa<U+2019>s largest national park, the saline lake of [[Manyara]], famous for attracting giant flocks of [[flamingo]]s, and the [[Ngorongoro]] Crater, well known for its abundant wildlife.<ref name=GFDFL/> The final two sites for her visit were [[Olduvai Gorge]] in Tanzania (the archeological site of [[Louis Leakey|Louis]] and [[Mary Leakey]]); and Mt. Mikeno in Congo, where in 1959, American zoologist [[George Schaller]] had carried out a yearlong pioneering study of the mountain gorilla. At Olduvai Gorge, Fossey met Leakey and his wife while they were examining the area for [[hominid]] [[fossil]]s. Leakey talked to Fossey about the work of [[Jane Goodall]] and the importance of long-term research of the great apes.<ref name=GFDFL/> Although she had broken her ankle while visiting the Leakeys,<ref name=GFDFL/> by October 16, Fossey was staying in Walter Baumgartel's small hotel in [[Uganda]], the Travellers Rest. Baumgartel, an advocate of gorilla conservation, was among the first to see the benefits that tourism could bring to the area, and he introduced Fossey to Kenyan wildlife photographers [[Joan Root|Joan]] and [[Alan Root]]. The couple agreed to allow Fossey and Alexander to camp behind their own camp, and it was during these few days that Fossey first encountered wild mountain gorillas.<ref name=GFDFL/> After staying with friends in Rhodesia, Fossey returned home to Louisville to repay her loans. She published three articles in ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'' newspaper, detailing her visit to Africa.<ref name=innominate/><ref name=GFDFL/>

===Research in the Congo===
When Leakey made an appearance in Louisville while on a nationwide lecture tour, Fossey took the color supplements that had appeared about her African trip in ''The Courier-Journal'' to show to Leakey, who remembered her and her interest in mountain gorillas. Three years after the original safari, Leakey suggested that Fossey could undertake a long-term study of the gorillas in the same manner as [[Jane Goodall]] had with chimpanzees in Tanzania.<ref name=farley/>

After studying [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and auditing a class on primatology during the eight months it took to get her visa and funding, Fossey arrived in Nairobi in December 1966. With the help of Joan Root and Leakey, Fossey acquired the necessary provisions and an old canvas-topped [[Land Rover]] which she named <U+201C>Lily.<U+201D>  On the way to the Congo, Fossey visited the [[Gombe Stream National Park|Gombe Stream Research Centre]] to meet Goodall and observe her research methods with chimpanzees.<ref name=GFDFL/> Accompanied by photographer Alan Root, who helped her obtain work permits for the [[Virunga mountains]], Fossey began her field study at [[Kabara]], in the Congo in early 1967, in the same meadow where Schaller had made his camp seven years earlier.<ref name="Montgomery136">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|p=136}}</ref>  Root taught her basic gorilla tracking, and his tracker Sanwekwe later helped in Fossey's camp. Living in tents on mainly tinned produce, once a month Fossey would hike down the mountain to <U+201C>Lily<U+201D> and make the two-hour drive to the village of [[Kikumba]] to restock.<ref name=GFDFL/>

Fossey identified three distinct groups in her study area, but could not get close to them. She eventually found that mimicking their actions and making grunting sounds assured them, together with submissive behaviour and eating of the local celery plant.<ref name="Montgomery136"/> She later attributed her success with habituating gorillas to her experience working as an occupational therapist with autistic children.<ref name=farley/> Like George Schaller, Fossey relied greatly on individual <U+201C>noseprints<U+201D> for identification, initially via sketching and later by camera.<ref name=GFDFL/>

Fossey had arrived in the Congo in locally turbulent times. Known as the [[Belgian Congo]] until its independence in June 1960, unrest and rebellion plagued the new government until 1965, when Lieutenant General [[Joseph-D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9> Mobutu]], by then commander-in-chief of the national army, seized control of the country and declared himself president for five years during what is now called the [[Congo Crisis]]. During the political upheaval, a rebellion and battles took place in the [[Kivu]] Province. On July 9, 1967, soldiers arrived at the camp to escort Fossey and her research workers down, and she was interned at [[Rumangabo]] for two weeks. Fossey eventually escaped through bribery to Walter Baumg<U+00E4>rtel's Travellers Rest Hotel in [[Kisoro]], where her escort was arrested by the Ugandan military.<ref name=GFDFL/><ref>[http://www.gorillafund.org/dian_fossey/ About Dian Fossey - Info about the Life of Dian Fossey - DFGFI<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Advised by the Ugandan authorities not to return to Congo, after meeting Leakey in Nairobi, Fossey agreed with him against US Embassy advice to restart her study on the Rwandan side of the Virungas.<ref name=GFDFL/> In Rwanda, Fossey had met local American expatriate [[Rosamond Carr]], who introduced her to [[Belgium|Belgian]] local Alyette DeMunck; DeMunck had a local's knowledge of Rwanda and offered to find Fossey a suitable site for study.<ref name=GFDFL/>

==Conservation work in Rwanda==
On September 24, 1967, Fossey founded the [[Karisoke]] Research Center, a remote [[rainforest]] camp nestled in [[Ruhengeri]] province in the saddle of two volcanoes. For the research center's name, Fossey used <U+201C>Kari<U+201D> for the first four letters of Mt. Karisimbi that overlooked her camp from the south, and <U+201C>soke<U+201D> for the last four letters of Mt. Visoke, the slopes of which rose to the north, directly behind camp.<ref name=GFDFL/> Established {{convert|3000|m|ft}} up Mount Visoke, the defined study area covered {{convert|25|km2|mi2}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/07/archive/fossey-gorillas-1981/dian-fossey-text/2|title=Dian Fossey text|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=2009-12-14}}</ref> She became known by locals as Nyirmachabelli, roughly translated as "The woman who lives alone on the mountain."<ref name="Montgomery130">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|p=130}}</ref>

Unlike the gorillas from the Congo side of the Virungas, the Karisoke area gorillas had never been partially habituated by Schaller's study; they knew humans only as poachers, and it took longer for Fossey to be able to study the Karisoke gorillas at a close distance.<ref name="Montgomery138">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|p=138}}</ref>

Many research students left after not being able to handle the cold, dark, and extremely muddy conditions around Karisoke on the slopes of the Virunga Volcanoes, where paths usually have to be cut through six-foot-tall grass with a machete.<ref name="Montgomery131">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|pp=131<U+2013>2}}</ref>

===Opposition to poaching===
While [[poaching]] had been illegal in the national park of the [[Virunga Volcanoes]] in Rwanda since the 1920s, the law was rarely enforced by park conservators, who were often bribed by poachers and paid a salary less than Fossey's own African staff.<ref name="farley"/> On three occasions, Fossey wrote that she witnessed the aftermath of the capture of infant gorillas at the behest of the park conservators for zoos; since gorillas will fight to the death to protect their young, the kidnappings would often result in up to 10 adult gorillas' deaths.<ref name="farley"/>
Through the Digit Fund, Fossey financed patrols to destroy poachers' traps in the Karisoke study area. In four months in 1979, the Fossey patrol consisting of four African staffers destroyed 987 poachers' traps in the research area's vicinity.<ref name="Mowat223">{{Harvnb|Mowat|p=223}}</ref> The official Rwandan national park guards, consisting of 24 staffers, did not eradicate any poachers' traps during the same period.<ref name="Mowat223"/> In the eastern portion of the park not patrolled by Fossey, poachers virtually eradicated all the park's [[elephant]]s for ivory and killed more than a dozen gorillas.<ref name="Mowat223"/>

Dr. Fossey helped in the arrest of several poachers, some of whom served or are serving long prison sentences.<ref name="Mowat174"/>

In 1978, Fossey attempted to prevent the export of two young gorillas, Coco and Pucker, from Rwanda to the [[Cologne Zoological Garden|zoo]] in [[Cologne, Germany]]. During the capture of the infants at the behest of the Cologne Zoo and Rwandan park conservator, 20 adult gorillas had been killed.<ref name="Mowat74">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=74<U+2013>8}}</ref> The infant gorillas were given to Fossey by the park conservator of the [[Virunga Volcanoes]] for treatment of injuries suffered during their capture and captivity. With considerable effort, she restored them to some approximation of health. Over Fossey's objections, the gorillas were shipped to Cologne, where they lived nine years in captivity, both dying in the same month.<ref name="farley"/> She viewed the holding of animals in "prison" ([[zoo]]s) for the entertainment of people as unethical.<ref name="fossey">Fossey, Dian : ''Gorillas in the Mist''. 1983</ref>

While gorillas from fringe groups on the mountains that were not part of Fossey's study had often been found poached five to ten at a time, and had spurred Fossey to conduct her own anti-poaching patrols, Fossey's study groups had not been direct victims of poaching until Fossey's favored gorilla Digit was killed in 1978. Later that year, the [[Silverback#Group_life|silverback]] of Digit's Group 4, named for Fossey's Uncle Bert, was shot in the heart while trying to save his son, Kweli, from being seized by poachers cooperating with the Rwandan park conservator.<ref name="Mowat187">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=187<U+2013>190}}</ref> Kweli's mother, Macho, was also killed in the raid, but Kweli was not captured due to Uncle Bert's intervention; however, three-year-old Kweli died slowly and painfully of [[gangrene]], from being brushed by a poacher's bullet.<ref name="fossey"/><ref name="Mowat187"/>

According to Fossey's letters, ORTPN (the Rwandan national park system), the [[World Wildlife Fund]], [[African Wildlife Foundation]], Fauna Preservation Society, the Mountain Gorilla Project and some of her former students tried to wrest control of the Karisoke research center from her for the purpose of tourism, by portraying her as unstable. In her last two years, Fossey claims not to have lost any gorillas to poachers; however, the Mountain Gorilla Project, which was supposed to patrol the [[Mount Sabyinyo]] area, tried to cover up gorilla deaths caused by poaching and diseases transmitted through tourists. Nevertheless, these organizations received most of the public donations directed towards gorilla conservation.<ref name="farley"/> The public often believed their money would go to Fossey, who was struggling to finance her anti-poaching and bushmeat hunting patrols, while organizations collecting in her name put it into tourism projects and as she put it "to pay the airfare of so-called conservationists who will never go on anti-poaching patrols in their life." Fossey described the differing two philosophies as her own "active conservation" or the international conservation groups' "theoretical conservation."<ref name="Mowat174"/>

===Opposition to tourism===
Dian Fossey strongly opposed tourism, as gorillas are very susceptible to diseases by humans like the flu for which they have no immunity. Dian Fossey reported several cases in which gorillas died because of diseases spread by tourists. She also viewed tourism as an interference into their natural wild behaviour.<ref name="farley"/> Fossey also criticised tourist programs, often paid for by international conservation organisations, for interfering with both her research and the peace of the mountain gorillas' habitat.<ref name="Mowat174">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=174<U+2013>5}}</ref>
Today, however, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International recognizes the importance of tourism in helping to create a stable and sustainable local community dedicated to protecting the gorillas and their habitat. <ref>http://gorillafund.org/travel?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=travel&utm_campaign=homepagetravel</ref>

===Preservation of habitat===
Fossey is responsible for the revision of a European Community project that converted parkland into [[pyrethrum]] farms. Thanks to her efforts, the park boundary was lowered from the 3,000-meter line to the 2,500-meter line.<ref name="farley"/>

===Digit Fund===
{{Main|Digit Fund}}
Sometime during the day on [[New Year's Eve]] 1977, Fossey's favourite gorilla, Digit, was killed by poachers. As the sentry of study group 4, he defended the group against six poachers and their dogs, who ran across the gorilla study group while checking [[antelope]] traplines. Digit took five spear wounds in ferocious self-defence and managed to kill one of the poachers' dogs, allowing the other 13 members of his group to escape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/07/archive/fossey-gorillas-1981/dian-fossey-text/5|title=Dian Fossey text - P5|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=2009-12-14}}</ref> Digit was decapitated, and his hands cut off for ashtrays, for the price of $20. After his mutilated body was discovered by research assistant [[Ian Redmond]], Fossey's group captured one of the killers. He revealed the names of his five accomplices, three of whom were later imprisoned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/07/archive/fossey-gorillas-1981/dian-fossey-text/6|title=Dian Fossey text - P6|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=2009-12-14}}</ref>

Fossey subsequently created the [[Digit Fund]] (now the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International in the USA)<ref>This organisation is unaffiliated with the Gorilla Organization in the UK, which uses Dian's name although it no longer funded her work after Digit's death.</ref> to raise money for anti-poaching patrols.<ref name="fossey"/> In addition, a consortium of international gorilla funds arose to accept donations in light of Digit's death and increased attention on poaching.<ref name="Mowat187"/> Fossey mostly opposed the efforts of the international organisations, which she felt inefficiently directed their funds towards more equipment for Rwandan park officials, some of whom were alleged to have ordered some of the gorilla poachings in the first place.<ref name="Mowat187"/>

The deaths of some of her most studied gorillas caused Fossey to devote more of her attention to preventing poaching and less on scientific publishing and research.<ref name="Mowat187"/> Fossey became more intense in protecting the gorillas and began to employ more direct tactics: she and her staff cut animal traps almost as soon as they were set; frightened, captured and humiliated the poachers; held their cattle for ransom; burned their hunting camps and even mats from their houses.<ref name=innominate/> Fossey also constantly challenged the local officials to enforce the law and assist her.

==Personal life==
During her African safari, Fossey met Alexie Forrester, the brother of an African she had been dating in Louisville; Fossey and Forrester later became engaged. In her later years, Fossey became involved with ''National Geographic'' photographer [[Bob Campbell (photographer)|Bob Campbell]] after a year of working together at Karisoke, with Campbell promising to leave his wife.<ref name=innominate/> Eventually the pair grew apart through her dedication to the gorillas and Karisoke, along with his need to work further afield and his marriage.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In 1970, during her time in Cambridge to get her Ph.D., she discovered she was pregnant and had an abortion, later commenting that "you can't be a cover girl for ''National Geographic'' magazine and be pregnant."<ref name=innominate/> Fossey had other relationships throughout the years and always had a love for children.<ref name="nytimes 7.15.90"/> Since Fossey would rescue any abused or abandoned animal she saw in Africa or near Karisoke, she acquired a menagerie in the camp, including a monkey who lived in her cabin, Kima, and a dog, Cindy. Fossey held Christmas parties every year for her researchers, staffers, and their families, and she developed a genuine friendship with [[Jane Goodall]].<ref name="Mowat269">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=269}}</ref>

Fossey had been plagued by lung problems from an early age, and later in her life, Fossey suffered from advanced [[emphysema]] brought on by years of heavy [[health effects of tobacco|cigarette smoking]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Gorillas' Protector on the Hunt for Poachers |author= |newspaper=The Palm Beach Post |date=October 24, 1985 |page=B8 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VBEjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=O84FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1038%2C1557499 |quote=A tall Californian, Fossey has emphysema.

==Death==
Fossey was discovered murdered in the bedroom of her cabin in [[Virunga Mountains]], [[Rwanda]], in late December 1985. She was discovered {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} away from a hole that her assailant(s) had apparently cut in the wall of the cabin. 

She was presumably in the act of loading her weapon when she was murdered, but had picked the wrong type of ammunition during the struggle; the cabin was littered with broken glass and overturned furniture. Robbery was not believed to be the motive for the crime, as Fossey's valuables were still in the cabin: thousands of dollars in cash, travelers' checks, and photo equipment remained untouched. 

The last entry in her diary read:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dian-fossey.com/|title=Dian Fossey|publisher=dian-fossey.com|accessdate=2009-12-14}}</ref>
{{bq|quote=When you realize the value of all life, you dwell less on what is past and concentrate more on the preservation of the future.}}

Fossey is buried at Karisoke,<ref name=Darkness>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirasalak.com/Darkness.html |title=PLACES OF DARKNESS: AFRICA'S MOUNTAIN GORILLAS |last=Salak |first=Kira |publisher=National Geographic Adventure }}</ref><ref name=DarknessPhotos>{{cite web |url= http://www.kirasalak.com/PhotosRwandaGorillas.html |title=Photos from "PLACES OF DARKNESS: AFRICA'S MOUNTAIN GORILLAS" |last=Salak |first=Kira |publisher=National Geographic Adventure}}</ref> in a site that she herself had constructed for her deceased gorilla friends. She was buried in the gorilla graveyard next to Digit, and near many gorillas killed by poachers. Memorial services were also held in New York, Washington, and California.<ref name="Montgomery162">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|pp=162<U+2013>3}}</ref>

After Fossey's death, her entire staff, including Rwelekana, a tracker she had fired months before, were arrested. All but Rwelekana, who was later found dead in prison, supposedly having hanged himself, were released.<ref name="farley"/> Rwandan courts later tried and convicted Wayne McGuire, Fossey<U+2019>s last research assistant at Karisoke, for her murder. McGuire was convicted ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' after he had returned to the United States following the murder, and because no [[extradition]] treaty exists between the U.S. and Rwanda, McGuire, whose guilt is still widely questioned, will not serve his sentence unless he returns to Rwanda<U+2019>s jurisdiction. <ref name="farley"/>  

Fossey's will stated that all of her money (including proceeds from the film ''[[Gorillas in the Mist]]'') should go to the Digit Fund to finance anti-poaching patrols. However, her mother Kitty Price challenged the will and was successful.<ref name="farley"/>

===Speculation===
On the night of Fossey's murder, a metal sheeting from her bedroom was removed at the only place of the bedroom where it would not have been obstructed by her furniture, which supports the case that the murder was committed by someone who was familiar with the cabin and her day-to-day activities. The sheeting of her cabin, which was normally securely locked at night, might also have been removed after the murder to make it appear as if the killing was the work of outsiders.

[[Farley Mowat]]'s biography of Fossey, ''[[Woman in the Mists]]'' (New York, NY: Warner Books, 1987), suggests that it is unlikely that she was killed by poachers. According to Mowat, it is unlikely that a stranger could have entered her cabin by cutting a hole and then going to her living-room to get the panga, giving Fossey time to escape; the number of untouched valuables also makes it unlikely to have been the act of a poor poacher. According to the book, poachers would have been more likely to kill her in the forest, with little risk to themselves. Mowat hence believes that she was killed by those who viewed her as an impediment to the touristic and financial exploitation of the gorillas. According to Linda Melvern in her book ''Conspiracy to Murder'', [[Protais Zigiranyirazo]], Pr<U+00E9>fet of [[Ruhengeri]], animal trader and Rwanda's ex-president's brother-in-law, could also have been "implicated in the murder of Dian Fossey in 1985." Quoting Nick Gordon, author of a book about Fossey's death, "Another reason why she might have been murdered is that she knew too much about the illegal trafficking by Rwanda's ruling clique." Protais Zigiranyirazo also had strong financial interests in gorilla tourism.

Many of the organizations that opposed Fossey, including ORTPN (the Rwandan tourism office) and other wildlife organizations, used and continue to use her name for their financial gain up to this day.<ref name="farley"/> Weeks before her death, ORTPN refused to renew her visa, and pressure on Fossey was mounting. However, Fossey managed to obtain a special two-year visa through Augustin Nduwayezu, a benevolent Secretary-General in charge of immigration.<ref name="farley"/> Mowat believes that the extension of her visa amounted to a de facto death warrant.

==Controversy==
Six months before her murder, AP East Africa Correspondent Barry Shlachter quoted Fossey in one of her last interviews as saying that she was habituating gorillas only to whites because blacks were the poachers. {{Cn|date=April 2013}} They said Rwandans whom she suspected of poaching had been stripped and beaten with stinging nettles by Fossey, who removed their [[Animism|animist]] amulets, set fire to one villager's home and kidnapped their child, holding the little girl hostage for days. {{Cn|date=April 2013}} This extreme case of Dian's vengeance, combined with reports of the torture of poachers, triggered real concern from conservationists and Rwandan officials about Fossey<U+2019>s mental stability and responsibility as a research center director. {{Cn|date=April 2013}} After her murder, Fossey's ''National Geographic'' editor, Mary Smith, told Shlachter that the famed gorilla expert on visits to the United States would "load up on firecrackers, cheap toys and magic tricks as part of her method to mystify the (Africans) -- hold them at bay."<ref>Shlachter, Barry. "A Neighborhood Feud? The strange life and gruesome death of Dian Fossey, July 8, 1986, ''Boston Phoenix''</ref>

Writing in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in 2002, [[Tunku Varadarajan]] described Fossey at the end of her life as colourful, controversial, and "a racist alcoholic who regarded her gorillas as better than the African people who lived around them."<ref name=innominate/><ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1015200880517583680.html?mod=googlewsj Giants of the Jungle]</ref>

==Scientific achievements {{Anchor|Scientific and Conservational Achievements}}==

Fossey made discoveries about gorillas including how females transfer from group to group over the decades, gorilla vocalization, hierarchies and social relationships among groups, rare infanticide, gorilla diet, and how gorillas recycle nutrients.<ref name="Montgomery149">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|p=149}}</ref> Fossey's research was funded by the Wilkie Foundation and the Leakey Home, with primary funding from the [[National Geographic Society]].<ref name="Mowat200">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=200<U+2013>1}}</ref>

===Cornell University and autobiography===
By 1980, Fossey, who had obtained her PhD at [[Cambridge University]] in the UK, was recognized as the world's leading authority on the physiology and behaviour of mountain gorillas, defining gorillas as being "dignified, highly social, gentle giants, with individual personalities, and strong family relationships."<ref name=webster/>

Fossey lectured as professor at Cornell University in 1981-1983. Her bestselling book ''[[Gorillas in the Mist]]'' was praised by [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]], the Dutch ethologist and ornithologist who won the 1973 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]. Her book remains the best-selling book about gorillas.<ref name="farley">Mowat, Farley. ''Woman in the Mists: The Story of Dian Fossey and the Mountain Gorillas of Africa''. Warner Books, 1987.</ref>

==Legacy==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2012}}
After her death, Fossey's Digit Fund in the U.S. was renamed the [[Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International]]. The [[Karisoke Research Center]] is operated by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International, and continues the daily gorilla monitoring and protection that she started.

One of Fossey's friends, Shirley McGreal, continues to work for the protection of primates through the work of her [[International Primate Protection League]] (IPPL) one of the few wildlife organizations that according to Fossey effectively promotes "active conservation".

Between Fossey's death until the 1994 [[Rwanda genocide]], Karisoke was directed by former students, some of whom had opposed her.<ref name="farley"/>  During the genocide and subsequent period of insecurity, the camp was completely [[looting|looted]] and destroyed. Today only remnants remain of her cabin. During the [[civil war]] the [[Virunga parks]] were filled with refugees and illegal logging destroyed vast areas.

Today, the Rwandan people have realized the importance of the mountain gorillas and their natural habitat. They have adapted the traditional household baby naming ceremony [[Kwita Izina]] - into the Baby Gorilla Naming Ceremony in which each baby gorilla is given a name by invited guests and celebrities at an annual, internationally famous event under the patronage of the President.

===Books===
Mowat's ''Virunga'', whose British and U.S. editions are called ''[[Woman in the Mists]]: The Story of Dian Fossey and the Mountain Gorillas of Africa'', was the first book-length biography of Fossey, and it serves as an insightful counterweight to the many omissions in Fossey's own story, being derived from Fossey's actual letters and entries in her journals.

A new book published in 2005 by [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] in the [[United States]] and [[Palazzo Editions]] in the [[United Kingdom]] as ''[[No One Loved Gorillas More]]'', written by [[Camilla de la Bedoyere]]. ''Dreams: The Legacy of Dian Fossey'' was published, written by the investigative journalist Georgianne Nienaber. This fictional account is a romanticized fantasy of Fossey's story told as if in her own words from beyond the grave.

More recently, the [[Kentucky Opera]] Visions Program, in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], has written an [[opera]] about Fossey. The [[opera]], entitled ''Nyiramachabelli'', premiered on May 23, 2006.

[[Harold Hayes]]' book ''[[The Dark Romance of Dian Fossey]]'' was published in 1989 after extensive interviews with people who lived and worked with Fossey. Haye's revealing book shows Fossey candidly, flaws and all, in a less romanticized light than previous accounts, including details about her abuse of alcohol and problematic relationships with people. The film ''Gorillas in the Mist'' was based on Hayes' 1987 article in ''Life'' magazine, as cited in the film's credits, instead of Fossey's self-edited autobiography by that title.

Fossey is also prominently featured in a book by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' journalist [[Alex Shoumatoff]] called ''African Madness'', in which the author expands on Fossey's controversial behaviors, implying that Fossey provoked her own murder by way of her private and public inflammatory interactions with people.

====''Gorillas in the Mist''====
[[Universal Studios]] bought the film rights to ''[[Gorillas in the Mist (book)|Gorillas in the Mist]]'' from Fossey in 1985, and [[Warner Bros. Studios]] bought the rights to the Hayes article, despite its having been severely criticized by [[Rosamond Carr]]. As a result of a legal battle between the two studios, a co-production was arranged.

Portions of ''Gorillas in the Mist'' and the Hayes article were adapted for ''[[Gorillas in the Mist|Gorillas in the Mist: The Story of Dian Fossey]]'', starring [[Sigourney Weaver]]. The book covers Fossey's scientific career in great detail and omits material on her personal life, such as her affair with photographer [[Robert M Campbell|Bob Campbell]]. In the film, the affair with Campbell (played by [[Bryan Brown]]) forms a major subplot.

The Hayes article preceding the movie portrayed Fossey as a woman obsessed with gorillas, who would stop at nothing to protect them. The film includes scenes of Fossey's ruthless dealings with poachers, including a scene in which she sets fire to a poacher's home.

====''All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace'' ====
In the 2011 BBC documentary ''[[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (television documentary series)|All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace]]'', [[Adam Curtis]] uses Fossey as a symbol of the ideology of [[ecology]], a balance of nature and western post-colonial political exploits in Africa.

===="Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom: Reunion With the Gorillas"====
This episode of the groundbreaking wildlife series, aired in 1984, features footage of Dr. Fossey interacting with the great apes in the Viruna Mountains after being away from them for about three years.  The documentary-style video is narrated by Dian Fossey and Marlin Perkins.  She shares some of her observations and personal experiences, concerning the gorillas in the band she had spent so much time learning to understand. This video can be viewed on YouTube.
