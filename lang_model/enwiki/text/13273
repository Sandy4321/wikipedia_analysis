"'''E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)'''" or "'''E-I-E-I- D'oh'''" is the fifth episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 11)|11th season]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It originally aired in the [[United States|U.S.]] on November 7, 1999. This episode is the last to air in the AABF ([[The Simpsons (season 10)|tenth season]]) production line.

==Plot==
The Simpsons go to a [[movie theater]] to see ''The Poke of Zorro''. Afterwards, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], imitating Zorro, frightens [[Snake Jailbird|Snake]] away by challenging him to a [[duel]] by slapping him with a glove when he insults [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]; he then starts to use his dueling glove to get anything he wants from people. First up is [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] for calling him heavyset, but after a slap, he gives Homer a free beer. Thus begins a short montage to the tune of "Glove Slap" (a parody of [[The B-52s]]' song "[[Love Shack]]"). When a gun-toting Southern [[colonel (title)|colonel]] (whose voice is similar to [[Foghorn Leghorn]]'s) at the [[Kwik-E-Mart]] actually "accepts" Homer's challenge, Homer finds himself bound to a duel at [[dawn]] (scheduled for 6:20 in the morning) the following day. The colonel and his wife set up camp outside the house in his [[Recreational vehicle|RV]] (which bears bumper stickers like "Honk if You Demand Satisfaction"), awaiting the duel.

With Homer fearing for his life, the family sneak out (Homer clinging to an old Christmas tree) and search for a temporary home. Along the way they spy [[Jimmy Carter]]'s Habitat for Humanity. Homer calls Carter a lazy bum, who responds by pulling off his glove to slap him, as Homer has been doing (the house is for [[Cletus Spuckler|Cletus]]' family). They find [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]]'s [[Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy|old farmhouse]] on Rural Route 9 outside of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], where they decide to live and, despite the [[Arable land|land]]'s poor reputation for growing crops, Homer becomes a farmer.

Homer calls [[Lenny Leonard|Lenny]] and requests that he send [[plutonium]] to make the [[Crop (agriculture)|crops]] grow "real big, real fast." They do eventually grow, but since Homer had accidentally mixed the tomato seeds with the tobacco seeds, he decides to call the tomato-cross with tobacco, Tomacco. Homer and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] set up a stall, Homer providing tomacco and Marge, fresh-baked [[Mincemeat|mincemeat pie]]. While the pies do not sell well, the tomacco is such a success that executives from [[List of products in The Simpsons#Laramie Cigarettes|Laramie Cigarettes]] offer to buy the rights to Tomacco for $150 million.

[[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] protests that the Simpsons cannot accept the tobacco executives' money (<U+201C>They make billions off of the suffering and deaths of others!<U+201D>), but Homer misinterprets this statement, and rejects the offer as insulting, demanding $150 billion for tomacco, which they (ostensibly) refuse to pay. Dumped back at the farmhouse, the family sees tomacco-addicted animals from other farms eating their crops. Homer saves the last plant, but when the rest of the animals attack the house, he tosses it into the air, and it lands right in the hands of a Laramie executive. The Laramie executives' [[helicopter]] leaves, but a tomacco-addicted [[domestic sheep|sheep]] has sneaked on board and creates mayhem, causing the helicopter to fly out of control and crash, destroying the final tomacco plant and killing the executives (the sheep inexplicably survives). With all the tomacco crops gone, the Simpsons return to Springfield, forgetting that the Colonel is still waiting for them. Now that there is no getting out of the duel, the Colonel shoots Homer in the arm, but Homer says he will only go to the hospital after he tries some of Marge's pie, and he promptly digs into one.

*The title is a reference to E-I-E-I-O of "[[Old McDonald Had a Farm]]".
*The "Glove Slap" song is a parody of the song "[[Love Shack]]". [[The B-52's]] sang both the original and the amended version used in the episode.
*The [[Buzz Cola]] advertisement shown before the movie is a parody of ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', directed by [[Steven Spielberg]].
*The movie the Simpsons see, ''The Poke of Zorro'', is a parody of ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]''.
*Other films that are playing in the cinema that are parodies of other movies are: ''[[My Dinner With Andre|My Dinner With]] [[Jar Jar Binks|Jar-Jar]]'', ''[[Mars Needs Women|Mars Needs Towels]]'', ''[[That 70s Show|That 70's Movie]]'', ''[[Shakespeare in Love|Shakespeare in Heat]]'', ''[[Rocky IV|Facepuncher IV]]'', and  ''[[Das Boot|Das Booty Call]]''.
*[[Meryl Streep]] and [[Victoria Beckham|Posh Spice]] appear in the credits of the Zorro film cast as "Stupid [[Nun]]" and "Wise Nun" respectively. [[Anthony Hopkins]]', [[James Earl Jones]]' and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]]'s names also appear in the credits; Jones appears credited as "Magic Taco".
*The farmer using an elephant to measure the height of his stalks of corn is in reference to a song in the musical ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', wherein the corn "is as high an elephant's eye".
*The Simpsons farming [[Musical montage|montage]] music is the theme song from ''[[Green Acres]]''.
*When the Southern colonel shows up at the Simpsons' house to duel, he says "Sir, I say sir!" much like cartoon character [[Foghorn Leghorn]]. He also has a similar accent.
*When Marge chastises Homer about the use of plutonium to make the crops grow, Homer refers back to the "colossal man" and the "giant grasshoppers" as justification for his actions. The "colossal man" refers directly to ''[[The Amazing Colossal Man]]'' while the "giant grasshoppers" is probably an allusion to ''[[Beginning of the End]]''. Both films are creations of film-maker [[Bert I. Gordon]], infamous for making B-grade movies revolving around common small organisms growing to mammoth proportions usually due to radiation exposure.
*At one part, Homer tells Marge, "Sometimes you have to break the rules to free your heart." She responds, "You got that from a movie poster." This, in fact, was the tagline to the film ''[[How Stella Got Her Groove Back]]''.
*When the ''Poke of Zorro'' credits roll, the producers are noted wishing to thank:
**The [[National Film Board]] of [[Canada]]
**The [[Philadelphia Flyers]]
**The makers of <U+201C>[[Lip balm|Whip Balm]]<U+201D>
**[[Bob Guccione]]
