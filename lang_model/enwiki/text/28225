The '''Manihiki Plateau''' is an [[oceanic plateau]] in the southwest [[Pacific Ocean]]. The Manihiki Plateau was formed by volcanic activity 125 to 120 million years ago during the mid-[[Cretaceous]] period at a [[triple junction]] plate boundary called the [[Tongareva triple junction]].<ref>[http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/30/1/67 Mid-Cretaceous tectonic evolution of the Tongareva triple junction in the southwestern Pacific Basin]</ref>
