Because of the extensive damage resulting from the hurricane, where the Hornets would play for the 2005-06 season came into question. Although the New Orleans Arena suffered only slight damage, the flooding surrounding the area made it impossible to use.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-09/02/content_474577.htm|title=NBA seeks relocation for New Orleans Hornets|date=September 2, 2005|work=China Daily|accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> With the [[training camp]] scheduled to begin on October 4, the team announced that the first three weeks of camp would be held at the [[Air Force Academy]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]], instead of their usual location, [[Alario Center]] in [[Westwego, Louisiana|Westwego]].<ref name="September 2, 2005">{{cite news

By September 10, the prospect of securing a Baton Rouge location to host the Hornets was fading as a result of the facilities being utilized for hurricane related relief operations.
