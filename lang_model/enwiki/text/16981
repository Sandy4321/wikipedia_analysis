The structure and substance of the Constitution were heavily influenced by constitutions of [[Western world|Western powers]] and by the nation's experiences during the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet era]]. While much of the Constitution establishes the government's functions and powers, an entire section details rights and freedoms granted to citizens and residents. The Constitution has been amended twice since the original adoption, in 1996 and in 2004. In the amendments [[referendum|approved by the Belarusian populace]], the power of the [[President of Belarus|presidency]] over the government was increased and the [[term limit]]s for the presidency were eliminated.

== Preamble ==
In the [[preamble]] of the Constitution, Belarus assumes the responsibility of its destiny as a member of the international community. To execute this responsibility, the government will show ''"adherence to values common to all mankind, founding ourselves on our inalienable right to self-determination,"'' which is ''"supported by the centuries-long history of development of Belarusian statehood."'' Belarus also pledges to honor the rights and freedoms of its citizens and to maintain a stable government that is run by the people based on the rule of law.<ref>Webportal of the President of the Republic of Belarus [http://www.president.gov.by/en/press10669.html Preamble of the Constitution]. Published 1994, amended in 1996. Retrieved [[May 01]], [[2007]].</ref>

== Section One ==
Section one of the Constitution sets up the governmental framework and establishes that the government is run by the people of Belarus. The government, which has been declared a multi-party representative democracy, would form its own foreign policy and is willing to defend these rights when necessary. This section also established that the state will protect the rights and freedoms of its citizens, but contains the proviso that a citizen of Belarus ''"bears a responsibility towards the State to discharge unwaveringly the duties imposed upon him by the Constitution."''<ref name="s1">Webportal of the President of the Republic of Belarus [http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19329.html Section One of the Constitution]. Published 1994, amended in 1996. Retrieved [[June 07]], [[2007]].</ref>

The government itself has a system of [[checks and balances]] for each branch of the government, but all of the branches are to be independent from influence from the other branches. The government is authorized to pass laws conforming with the provisions of the Constitution, by which it is expected to abide. If the laws do not conform with the Constitution, then they can be declared void. The laws themselves are subject to international law and Belarus is willing to ''"recognize the supremacy of the universally acknowledged principles of international law and ensure that its laws comply with such principles."''<ref name="s1"/>

The land area of Belarus is divided into discrete regions, called [[oblast]]s. The oblasts are further divided into districts which are in turn subdivided into cities. The Constitution also allows for special regions to be created, which are to be controlled by legislation. Citizens of Belarus are also promised protection and sponsorship, regardless of whether they are inside Belarusian borders or in a foreign country. With special exceptions, [[stateless person|those who do not have a nationality]] and foreigners are granted equal status as citizens of Belarus. Belarus also has the power to grant [[Political asylum|asylum]] to those who have been subject to persecution due to their ethnic background, political ideology or religious affiliation.<ref name="s1"/>

The Constitution also establishes [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] as the official languages of the country, pledges [[Neutral country|neutrality]] and non-[[nuclear proliferation]], adopts national symbols, and establishes [[Minsk]] as the capital (Minsk was previously the capital of the [[Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic]]).<ref name="s1"/>

== Section Two ==
Section two deals with rights that are granted to the citizens by the government. These basic rights, which include the "right to a dignified standard of living, including appropriate food, clothing, housing and likewise a continuous improvement of necessary living conditions", and protecting them will be the top goal of the government. These rights are granted to all citizens of Belarus, regardless of any factor, and everyone will be treated the same under Belarusian law. However, these rights can be removed for national security reasons or if Belarus is under a [[state of emergency]]. No one is allowed to "enjoy advantages and privileges that are contrary to the law."<ref name="s2">Webportal of the President of the Republic of Belarus [http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19330.html Section Two of the Constitution]. Published 1994, amended in 1996. Retrieved [[June 07]], [[2007]].</ref> The state of the emergency, which can be called by the President of Belarus according to Article 84, has to be approved by the Council of the Republic within three days of its announcement, according to Article 98.<ref name="s4"/>

The Constitution provides that life is a right, and that the government will protect the lives of its citizens against other citizens who wish to harm them or their property. The Constitution also allows for the [[death penalty]] to be exercised for grave crimes, but only in accordance with national law. If citizens are arrested, they are granted [[due process]] of law and do not have to testify against themselves or their family members. Citizens are also given the right to vote, housing, compensation for their share of work, and have the ability to move wherever they wish inside Belarus, and have the right to protest against the government.<ref name="s2"/>

== Section Three ==
Section three is divided in two chapters dealing with the process on how elections are organized and run. The first chapter deals with the Belarusian electoral system and the second chapter details the organization of national [[referendum]]s.<ref name="s3">Webportal of the President of the Republic of Belarus [http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19331.html Section Three of the Constitution]. Published 1994, amended in 1996. Retrieved [[June 07]], [[2007]].</ref>

In Belarus, the right to vote in elections and [[plebiscite]]s is extended to those who are above the age of eighteen. During elections and plebiscites, a citizen has an option to vote or not without any consequences from the government. There are two methods that will prevent a citizen from voting that are described in the Constitution. The first method is a court issues an order stating that the citizen does not have the mental capacity to understand and to cast a ballot. The second method is that a person being held in detention or confined in a prison during an election cannot cast a ballot. The Constitution does not state about the [[voting right]]s of those who have served their prison terms or how to gain the rights back.<ref name="s3"/>

National referendums, also called the plebiscite, are elections that citizens can determine if a specific legal text can become official law or not. In order for this to take place, the following can either happen: the President wishes to hold one, both houses of the National Assembly request to hold one or the citizens petition it. If the [[National Assembly of the Republic of Belarus|National Assembly]] calls for the plebiscite, a majority is needed in both chambers in order for it to be official. If the citizens request a plebiscite, they must gather 430,000 signatures from across the country from eligible voters. The additional requirement is that over 30,000 people from each region must sign the petition, including the capital of Minsk. Once either condition is met, the President has to issue a decree setting the date of the national plebiscite. The plebiscite takes place less than three months after the decree was signed. Local cities can hold their own plebiscites if ten percent of the local population ask for it.<ref name="s3"/>

== Section Four ==
Section four, which is divided into four chapters, deals with the functions of the [[Belarusian Government]], mainly the [[President of Belarus|President]] of the Republic of Belarus, the [[Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus|Council of Ministers]], the [[Parliament of Belarus]] and the courts. While he is elected by the Belarusian people, the president must not be a member of a political party when he or she assumes office. Official duties are also listed in the Constitution, such as the president being the Commander in Chief of the [[Military of Belarus|Belarusian Armed Forces]]. The section also deals with situations where the president cannot continue his duties or if he dies in office.<ref name="s4">Webportal of the President of the Republic of Belarus [http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19332.html Section Four of the Constitution]. Published 1994, amended in 1996. Retrieved [[June 07]], [[2007]].</ref>

The Parliament of Belarus, which is called the [[National Assembly of the Republic of Belarus|National Assembly]], has its powers and duties listed in Chapter Four. The National Assembly itself is divided into two houses, the lower [[House of Representatives of Belarus|House of Representatives]] and the upper [[Council of the Republic of Belarus|Council of the Republic]]. While each house has its own rules on how members are selected, members decide on the various bills that could become Belarusian law and also approve the nominations of cabinet heads that are chosen by the President.<ref name="s4"/>

The [[Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus]] is the body of officials that are heads of various ministries of the Belarusian government. Each member is appointed by the President, but each must be approved by the National Assembly, and stay on until his time as a minister is over or the president has been replaced. The council is headed by the [[List of Belarusian Prime Ministers|Prime Minister]].<ref name="s4"/>

The [[Constitutional Court of the Republic of Belarus]] is the highest court in Belarus. While other courts deal with issues of civil or criminal matter, the Constitutional Court deals with matters involving the Constitution and the legality of certain laws passed by the Government. The court has the powers to declare any law unconstitutional. From April until May 2007, the Constitutional Court reviewed 101 laws and decrees; they were deemed to be constitutional.<ref>Constitutional Court of the Republic of Belarus http://ncpi.gov.by/ConstSud/eng/ General Provisions and History]. Published [[May 21]], [[2007]]. Retrieved [[July 24]], [[2007]]</ref> The court that deals with criminal law matters is the [[Supreme Court of Belarus]].<ref name="s4"/>

== Section Five ==
Section five permits the formation of local governments. Local governments are selected by the local population and they have the power to administer local affairs, such as budgets, social services, economic development and collect taxes. The heads of the local governments can also be appointed and dismissed by the president.<ref name="s5">Webportal of the President of the Republic of Belarus [http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19333.html Section Five of the Constitution]. Published 1994, amended in 1996. Retrieved [[June 07]], [[2007]].</ref>

== Section Six ==
The office and duties of the prosecutor general (Procurator General in the official translation) and the State Supervisory Committee are listed in section six. The prosecutor general, and his appointed assistant prosecutors, are tasked with the even implementation of national, regional and local laws on all sectors of government and public society. The prosecutor general is appointed by the president, with permission from the Council of the Republic.<ref name="s6">Webportal of the President of the Republic of Belarus [http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19334.html Section Six of the Constitution]. Published 1994, amended in 1996. [[June 07]], [[2007]].</ref>

The State Supervisory Committee is tasked with monitoring the national budget, implement the president's economic policy and regulate the use of government property. Just like with the prosecutor general, the State Supervisory Committee is appointed by the president.<ref name="s6"/>

== Section Seven ==
The [[fiscal policy|fiscal]] responsibilities of Belarus are stated in this section. A national budget must be created, along with budgets for the local regions and cities. The money used in the national budget is acquired from taxes, fines and payments made to Belarus by foreign governments. At the end of a [[fiscal year]], the National Assembly must review the budget for the next fiscal year within a time frame of five months. After the review and passing of the national budget, it is published for public viewing. Local budgets follow the same procedures. The [[National Bank of the Republic of Belarus]] is the state bank of Belarus and is the office responsible for issuing the national currency, the [[Belarusian ruble]].<ref>Webportal of the President of the Republic of Belarus [http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19335.html Section Seven of the Constitution]. Published 1994, amended in 1996. Retrieved [[June 07]], [[2007]].</ref>

== Section Eight ==
Section eight deals with the enforcement and changing of the Constitution. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land, so all laws and edicts cannot conflict with the Constitution. If that does happen, the Constitution will apply. If the Constitution is not in conflict, but a law and a decree is, the law would be enforced.<ref name="s8">Webportal of the President of the Republic of Belarus [http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19336.html Section Eight of the Constitution]. Published 1994, amended in 1996. Retrieved [[June 07]], [[2007]].</ref>

To amend the Constitution, two things can happen before the [[National Assembly of the Republic of Belarus|National Assembly]] can consider the measure. The first option is for the president to suggest the change; the second option is for 150,000 eligible voters can send a petition to the National Assembly. To discuss the amendments, both chambers of the National assembly must spend a time frame of at least three months. Only two conditions can prevent a discussion to take place, a state of emergency or if there is less than six months in the current term of the House of Representatives. In order for the amendments to become a reality either two-thirds of both chambers of the National Assembly must approve of the measure or a simple majority of the voting population of Belarus in a national referendum. The only restriction is that sections one, two, four and eight can only be changed by national referendum.<ref name="s8"/> Rules for conducting the national referendum are enumerated in Chapters 22 through 25 of the Electoral Code of the Republic Belarus.<ref>Law of the Republic of Belarus [http://www.law.by/work/EnglPortal.nsf/6e1a652fbefce34ac2256d910056d559/913b1cd1d5b908b2c2256dc0004a698c?OpenDocument Electoral Code of the Republic of Belarus].

== Section Nine ==
The ninth, and last section, of the Constitution deals with laws passed before 1994. If the laws that are passed before the adoption of the Constitution do not have any legal conflicts, they are still enforced. All changes to the Constitution will come into effect when formally issued by the President, unless specified otherwise. With the passage of the Constitution in 1994, the law "On the Procedure Governing the Entry into Force of the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus" ceased to be enforced. The present leadership of Belarus can continue to serve until their term of service has been completed. When the Constitution is enforced, the national government is allowed to exercise their charged duties. Unless otherwise stated in Article 143, Part 3, the national leadership must form state governmental bodies two months after the Constitution goes into effect.<ref>Webportal of the President of the Republic of Belarus [http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19337.html Section Nine of the Constitution].

== Amendments ==
=== 1996 ===
The first calls for constitutional reform came in 1996, when it turned out the balance in the Belarusian government was shifting towards the unicameral Supreme Soviet.<ref name="houseby"/> In this amendment voted by [[referendum]] a number of significant changes were made to the Constitution, usually in order to strengthen the grip on power of the president.<ref>Human Rights Watch [http://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/belarus/Belrus99-04.htm Republic of Belarus - Background]. Published in 1999. Retrieved [[June 07]], [[2007]].</ref> Amongst the changes made are the following:

1- The [[Supreme Soviet]], the [[unicameral]] parliament of Belarus, was abolished. The Supreme Soviet was replaced by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of Belarus|National Assembly]], a [[bicameral]] parliament;<ref name="cnn96">CNN [http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/26/belarus/index.html Belarus president convenes new parliament].

2- The term of President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] was extended from 1999 until 2001.<ref name="cnn96"/>

During the referendum, 84% of the approximately 7.5 million voters agreed with the amendments.<ref>CNN [http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/24/belarus/ Belarus president poised for victory in constitution re-write].

The expanded roles allowed the Council of Ministers to deal with issues related to development of economic, social and political spheres within Belarus.<ref name="houseby"/> This was, however, not the first and only call to dissolve the Supreme Soviet. In 1991 and 1992, after the August coup in Moscow by senior [[CPSU]] officials, democratic forces in the government wanted to dissolve the body permanently. The members of the Belarusian Popular Front pressed for a referendum, and despite achieving the number of signatures required by law at the time, the Supreme Soviet vetoed the measure.<ref name="byind"/>

=== 2004 ===
In this referendum the term limits for the presidency were lifted meaning that President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] was able to run for a third term, whereas previously the Constitution stated that a president was limited to two terms.<ref>[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/law/icl/bo00000_.html Constitution of Belarus (1994)].

Both referendums were severely critisized by the political opposition inside of the Belarus as well as by the international observers (OSCE). They state that both referendums were non-transparent, and that the real results were not published. Observers were not allowed to see the process of counting ballots. The results of Lukasheko's 2006 reelection were challenged by the political opposition for the same reasons.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}
