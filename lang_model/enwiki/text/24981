'''WWT Slimbridge''' is a [[wetland]] reserve managed by the [[Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust]] (a UK charity) at [[Slimbridge]], [[Gloucestershire]], England. Slimbridge is halfway between Bristol and [[Gloucester]] on the estuary of the river [[Severn]]. The reserve was the first WWT centre to be opened, on 10 November 1946, thanks to the vision of artist and [[naturalist]] Sir [[Peter Scott]]. The United Kingdom now has eight other WWT sites.

The reserve exists to care for and study [[ducks]], [[geese]] and [[swan]]s of the world. To cater for bird and duck watchers, sixteen hides overlook the fields, streams and lakes bordering the River Severn and the [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]]. 

WWT Slimbridge is also the home of WWT Consulting, a subsidiary business of the Trust that provides clients with wetland consultancy services.

==Visitor Centre==
The Sloane Observation Tower gives far-reaching views to the [[Cotswolds|Cotswold]] escarpment in the east and the River Severn and [[Forest of Dean]] in the West. The centre has a shop, restaurant, art gallery and Tropical House.

==Site==
The site is 3 square kilometres of reserve, of which 500,000 square metres is landscaped and can be visited by the public.

The number of ducks, geese and [[swan]]s is greatest in winter, with large flocks of [[White-fronted Goose|White-fronted Geese]], sometimes with a rare [[Lesser White-fronted Goose]] amongst them. [[Bewick's Swan]]s are a feature of Slimbridge in winter, arriving from northern [[Russia]] to enjoy the milder climate of southern England. Their behaviour has been studied intensely at Slimbridge. The pattern on each bird's [[beak]] is unique and is recorded in small paintings from front and side views (rather like "[[mug shot]]s") to aid recognition. Birds are also given names (for example, Maud, [[The Major]], Ethel, Rudy and Aristotle). Other winter visitors are [[bird of prey|birds of prey]] such as [[Peregrine Falcon|Peregrine]] and [[Merlin (bird)|Merlin]], as well as wading birds and songbirds. 

During [[Queen Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]]'s 1950 tour of Canada, she was promised a [[Dominion]] gift of [[Trumpeter swan]]s, by arrangement of British conservationist [[Peter Scott (conservationist)|Peter Scot]] who was head of the Severn Wildlife Trust in Britain (now the WWT).<ref name=stowe14>[[Leland Stowe]] (1957).

Chapter 14: "The Saga of the Trumpeter Swans", pg.162-178.</ref> Canadian officials discovered the only swans tame enough to capture were at Lonesome Lake in [[British Columbia]] as they had been fed for decades by conservationist [[Ralph Edwards (homesteader)|Ralph Edwards]].<ref name=stowe14/> In 1952, with the help of Ralph and his daughter Trudy, five were captured and flown to England, the first time Trumpeter swans had ever flown across the Atlantic (although in the 19th century swans had been brought by ship to European zoos).<ref name=stowe14/> One later died, and the remaining four thrived at WWT Slimbridge.<ref name=stowe14/> The Queen in later years became Patron to the WWT, and Prince Charles the WWT President.<ref>[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ZO0oHhN9LcoJ:www.wwt.org.uk/news/all-news/2011/04/general-news/wwt-names-bewicks-swan-pair-william-and-kate-after-royal-couple/ "WWT names Bewick<U+2019>s swan pair William and Kate after royal couple"], WWT, 28 April 2011</ref>

An early success story in the 1950s was the saving of the [[Nene]] (or Hawaiian Goose) from [[extinction]]. Breeding at Slimbridge was successful and there are still Nene geese at Slimbridge today. However, initial reintroduction into the wild in [[Hawaii]] was unsuccessful since the Nene's natural environment was not protected from [[predator]]s introduced by man. Once the Nene's habitat was protected, reintroduction became successful.

A bust of founder Sir [[Peter Scott]] by Jacqueline Shackleton<ref>http://www.flickr.com/photos/35209608@N07/5147731241/</ref> was completed in 1986 and on display in the grounds. His wife Lady [[Philippa Scott]] sat for [[Jon Edgar]] as part of his Environmental Series of heads, and a bronze was unveiled in the visitor centre in December 2011. A sculpture by [[Kathleen Scott]], Peter Scott's mother, is also on display<ref>http://www.clevr.com/pano/326</ref> in the grounds.
