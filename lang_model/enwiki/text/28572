'''John Halsey''' (d. 1708) was a colonial American privateer and a later pirate who was active in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans during the early 17th century. Although much of his life and career is unknown, he is recorded by [[Daniel Defoe]] in ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'' which states ''"He was brave in his Person, courteous to all his Prisoners, lived beloved, and died regretted by his own People.   His Grave was made in a garden of watermelons, and fenced in with Palisades to prevent his being rooted up by wild Hogs."''

Born in [[Boston]], Halsey became a privateer in the service of [[Great Britain]] commanding of the 10-gun brigintine ''Charles'' during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], or [[Queen Anne's War]] as it was known in the American colonies, and raided French fishing fleets in [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] and later sailed to [[Fayal]] in the [[Azores]] and the to the [[Canary Islands]] where he attacked Spanish ship en route to [[Barcelona]] shipping during 1704. During the voyage, several of his men deserted as he put his lieutenant ashore at [[Cape Verde]] however they were subsequently returned to Halsey by the Portuguese governor recognising his commission. 

However, as his [[letter of marque]] expired the following year, he turned to piracy and sailed to Madagascar. As he made his way through the [[Cape of Good Hope]], he picked up several castaway sailors of the lost ''Degrave'' formerly under the command of Captain Young as he put into [[Augustine Bay]] for water, wood and other provisions. Leaving Augustine, he sailed for the [[Red Sea]] in search of Moorish treasure ships the Great Mogul and operated in the Indian Ocean throughout the year with some success.  

In late 1706, he and his gunner were charged cowardace and relieved of command by his crew after refusing to order an attack on a larger Dutch ship, hesitant to attack a European vessal. The crew, who presumed the ship to be a lone merchantman, went forward with their the attack and as they approched their intended victim, the Dutch ship turned to reveal its sixty guns and fired a warning shot towards the ''Charles'', which injured a crew member manning the wheel as well as unstripping the swivel gun and severely damaging the topsail. The attack by the Dutch caught many of the crew off guard casing many to flee into the hold. Although suffering heavy damage, the ''Charles'' was able to escape and Halsey was reinstated as commander shortly afterwards. 

Seizing two coastal traders off the [[Nicobar Islands]] in February 1707, he sailed to the [[Straits of Malacca]] fared poorly due to the low morale of the crew following the incident of the Dutch ship.   

Returning to [[Madagascar]], Halsey recruited additional men including his Quartermaster [[Nathaniel North]]. Setting sail for [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]], he encountered a British squadron consisting of five warships shorly after entering the [[Red Sea]] in August 1707. Despite a combined 62 guns, Halsey chose to engage the British fleet and, after forcing the largest to flee, the remaining warships scattered with Halsey capturing two of the warships, along with <U+00A3>50,000 in money and cargo. 

Following his return to Madagascar in January 1708, his entire fleet was virtually desroyed in a [[hurricane]] and died of a fever soon after.
