'''Apollo''' is a fictional character, a comic book superhero who first appeared in the ''[[Stormwatch (comics)|Stormwatch]]'' series, but is best known for his role in ''[[The Authority]]''. While visually distinct, Apollo is cast in the mold of the [[Superman]] archetype.

Apollo is notable for being one of the few [[homosexuality|gay]] superheroes in print. He's married to fellow The Authority member [[Midnighter]] and both have adopted [[Jenny Quantum]].

==Stormwatch==
Apollo was a former U.S. soldier and the leader of a black ops [[Stormwatch]] team so secret that no-one but the first Weatherman, [[Henry Bendix]], knew of its existence. Apollo was a normal human, bio-engineered by Bendix to have fantastic abilities including super-strength, heat vision, and a high degree of invulnerability. Apollo derives his power from solar energy, and becomes vulnerable to attack when that energy is depleted.

Of the seven-member team, only Apollo and [[Midnighter|The Midnighter]], Apollo's future husband, survived. Due to circumstances surrounding the mission, they went rogue and spent the next five years undercover fighting for a finer world in the alleyways of America. 

After Bendix's fall in 1998, Christine Trelane discovered files hinting at the existence of Apollo and The Midnighter. Jackson King, formerly [[Battalion (comics)|Battalion]], now the new Weatherman, ordered them found, not being sure if they were heroes or villains. Apollo and Midnighter were after weapons made in the "Nevada Garden", a leftover of the first [[Engineer (comics)|Engineer]]. He ordered [[Fahrenheit (comics)|Fahrenheit]] and [[Hellstrike]] to tag them with fetishes so they could be transported into [[SkyWatch]]. Apollo and Midnighter first attacked the Stormwatch team, believing them under Bendix's orders. However, they ceased the attack once they were told Bendix was dead. With King's help, they destroyed the Nevada Garden, and Trelane gave them new lives away from Stormwatch.

This story is available in the Stormwatch graphic novel '''A Finer World'''.

==The Authority==

'''Authority Vol 1'''

In 1999, [[Jenny Sparks]] convinced both Apollo and The Midnighter to come out of retirement to join a new team, dubbed [[The Authority]]. The Authority distinguished itself from other super-human teams in that it answered to no governing body or external authority, such as the UN. Rather, for the first time, these were super-humans fighting for a finer world on their own initiative. 

Apollo and Midnighter's relationship was revealed in ''The Authority'' # 8, written by Warren Ellis. For the portrayal of Apollo and Midnighter, The Authority received a [[GLAAD]] award.

On December 31, 1999, Jennifer Sparks died. Her spirit was reincarnated in an infant girl born the next day in Singapore. As soon as the child is identified a bloody battle breaks out between competing forces--including The Authority--for control of the child, code-named [[Jenny Quantum|Jennifer Quantum]]. Apollo was severely beaten in the course of the battle. In one of the more controversial scenes in the Millar run it is implied the beating is followed by a [[rape]] at the hands of ''The Commander'', a villain who is himself a [[Captain America]] pastiche (''The Authority'' #14). The rape is followed by a scene of revenge in which it is implied that The Midnighter gores The Commander with a jackhammer. This rape-revenge cycle was to be repeated in the [[The Authority|'''Transfer of Power''']] storyline.

Apollo and Midnighter were married and adopted Jenny at the end of Millar's run. From this point on, Apollo is referred to as The Midnighter's husband, and vice versa.

'''Authority Vol 2.'''

Apollo was mainly neglected as a character during this run, although the Engineer does reveal to Apollo that she once had sex with The Doctor, something she has never told her lover, Jack Hawksmoor.

This also marks the appearance of the infamous canopied four-poster bed. In the most intimate scene between Apollo and The Midnighter yet, the pair wake at dawn in their bed on the Carrier.

'''Human on the Inside'''

The U.S. President orders an assault on The Authority which results in doubts, depression, and human foibles overcoming them. The Midnighter kisses another man, but when he confesses this to Apollo, Apollo becomes enraged and strikes him, sending The Midnighter through a wall. This is the first time that Apollo and The Midnighter have become physically violent with each other.

'''Authority: Coup D'Etat and Authority: Revolution'''

Following a deadly mistake by US leaders, Authority team leader Jack Hawksmoor decides that the time has come to remove the US executive branch and run the country their way. The takeover goes smoothly, but the occupation does not go as planned. Shadowy forces intervene to destroy the Authority and put corporate interests back in power. 

In Authority: Coup D'Etat, Apollo and Midnighter are sent to raid the base of Stormwatch: Team Achilles, but they find it booby-trapped. After narrowly escaping with their lives, their next mission is to eliminate the US military's super-human training camp. Midnighter returns with the declaration that the program was "Not so special."

In Authority: Revolution, The Midnighter receives a revelation about the future which compels him to leave The Authority, permanently. He leaves Apollo and Jenny Quantum without an explanation and returns to the underground. Following a humiliating nuclear incident in Washington, DC, Hawksmoor resigns as President of the US and announces elections. The Authority disbands. From 2005 to 2008, Apollo raises Jenny alone in San Francisco, under the watchful eye of the US Government.

When Jenny is eight years old, a series of events propels her to take matters into her own hands and rebuild the team. She causes herself to jump in age to fourteen years, precipitating a verbal confrontation with her father, Apollo. With Apollo's support, she sets about to round up the surviving members of The Authority, including The Midnighter. In a painful moment between Jenny, Apollo, and Midnighter, Jenny tells Midnighter that she is "the product of a broken home."

In the battle that follows, Henry Bendix reveals that he has gained control over The Midnighter through a Trojan Horse strategy which delivered nanites into Midnighter's body. The Midnighter then fights Apollo and Jenny. Midnighter tells Apollo that he must kill him if he gets the chance, but Apollo refuses. Midnighter, with the aid of a device stolen from Dr. Krigstein's laboratory, defeats Apollo in battle, but Jenny is able to engage Midnighter long enough so that the Engineer can remove the mind-control implants and restore Midnighter.

==Powers==
Apollo's powers include super-strength, flight, and near invulnerability (he has been able to enter a [[lava]] flow to deactivate a [[volcano]]). His eyes are constructed to concentrate solar energy into laser like blasts, literally concentrated sunlight. Apollo can also release his solar energy from other parts of his body (hands, mouth, etc) or in an omni-directional flare, but these moves are taxing. He can fly as well, at least fast enough to circle the globe in just under 30 seconds.

Like Superman, Apollo's powers are dependent on the Sun. Unlike Superman however, his powers are far more directly dependent on the sun. Whereas Superman's abilities are somewhat more 'internal', needing only exposure or access to sunlight to activate, Apollo's body behaves much more directly like a battery, which discharges and recharges. His body was altered to store and convert solar energy to power his abilities, which disappear or weaken if his solar reserves are low. Conversely, his powers also increase the more energy he has absorbed. Apollo can drain himself through overuse of his powers since living on the Carrier does not provide him with a constant exposure to solar energy. However, even when drained he will be able to fly(barely) after 20 seconds in direct sunlight, though it would take him 2 hours to be at full charge. This can be somewhat circumvented by transporting (using the Carrier's 'Door' system) into close proximity to the sun. This is in contrast to Superman, who can never "run out" of power. He may weaken, but it's in the same vein as an athlete who has exhausted himself, rather than a car that has literally no fuel left to function. He is still nearly invulnerable, and very strong. Apollo will die if he completely depletes his solar stores, and his strength/resilience drop accordingly when weakened to the point where hes essentially normal. But, this can't happen to Superman.

Apollo has shown that at full charge he is possibly stronger, and more durable than Superman. He often walks directly on the surface of the sun for quick recharging, or to just be alone. 

He can survive in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] environments indefinitely (he flies in space, even all the way to the moon and into deep space), by the simple method of not breathing, as his body is entirely sustained by his solar energy. He also does not require food or drink. Although naturally he still does both. 

Apollo has been described a number of times as a [[Mister Majestic|Majestic]]-Class superhuman.
