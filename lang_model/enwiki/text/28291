[[Image:Bremner statue.jpg|thumb|right|135px|The statue of [[Billy Bremner]], who played for [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] between [[1959 in football (soccer)|1959]] to [[1978 in football (soccer)|1976]] and captained them to cup success in [[1968 Football League Cup Final|1968]] and [[1972 FA Cup Final|1972]].]]
This is a '''list of seasons played by Leeds United Association Football Club''' in English and European [[association football|football]]. It covers the period from the club's inaugural season in [[1919 in association football|1919]], following the demise of [[Leeds City F.C.|Leeds City]] earlier that year, to the end of the last completed season. It details the club's achievements in all major competitions, together with the top scorers and the average attendances for each season. Details of the abandoned [[1939-40 in English football|1939&ndash;40 season]] and unofficial [[World War II|Second World War]] leagues are not included.

[[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] were founded in October 1919, taking the place in the [[Midland Football League|Midland League]] vacated by Leeds City Reserves, and were elected to [[The Football League]] for the [[1920-21 in English football|1920&ndash;21 season]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mightyleeds.co.uk/seasons/192021.htm |title=Review of 1920&ndash;21 Back in the big time |work=The Mighty Mighty Whites. The definitive history of Leeds United |accessdate=2008-01-14 }}</ref> They won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title four years later to gain [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the top tier of English football, but had to wait almost 50 years before winning any major [[Silverware (sport)|silverware]], with success in the [[1968 Football League Cup Final]] accompanied by success in Europe in the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1967-68|final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]]. The following season brought league success when Leeds won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] championship. Their success continued into the 1970s with victory in the [[1972 FA Cup Final]], another league title in the [[1973-74 in English football|1973&ndash;74 season]] and runners-up in the [[1975 European Cup Final]]. A third league title in the [[1991-92 in English football|1991&ndash;92 season]], and a semi-final appearance in the [[UEFA Champions League]] in [[UEFA Champions League 2000-01|2001]], preceded a period of turbulence which culminated in relegation to [[Football League One|League One]] in the [[2006-07 in English football|2006&ndash;07 season]]. They dropped out of the top two tiers of English football for the first time in their history in a season that saw them deducted ten points for going into [[Administration (insolvency)|administration]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/6625751.stm |title=Relegated Leeds in administration |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2008-01-14 }}</ref>
