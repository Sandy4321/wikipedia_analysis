'''Werner M<U+00F6>lders''' (18&nbsp; March 1913 <U+2013> 22&nbsp;November 1941) was a German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' pilot. He was the leading German [[flying ace|fighter ace]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]; in [[World War II|World War&nbsp;II]], he became the first pilot in aviation history to claim 100 aerial victories<U+2014>that is, 100 aerial combat encounters resulting in the destruction of the enemy aircraft. The highly decorated M<U+00F6>lders was instrumental in the development of new fighter tactics which led to the [[finger-four]] formation. He died in the crash of an airplane in which he was a passenger.

M<U+00F6>lders joined the ''Luftwaffe'' in 1934 at age 21. In 1938, he volunteered for service in the ''[[Condor Legion]]'', which supported General [[Francisco Franco]]'s Nationalist [[Falange]] in the Spanish Civil War, and shot down 15 aircraft.<ref name="Obermaier page34">Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 34.</ref>  In World War II, he lost two wingmen in the [[Battle of France]] and the [[Battle of Britain]], but shot down 53 enemy aircraft. With his tally standing at 68 victories, M<U+00F6>lders and his unit, the [[Jagdgeschwader 51]] (JG 51), were transferred to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]] in June 1941 for the opening of ''[[Operation Barbarossa]]''. By the end of 22&nbsp;June 1941, the first day of ''Barbarossa'', he had added another four victories to his tally; a week later, he surpassed [[Manfred von Richthofen]]'s 1918&nbsp;record of 80&nbsp;victories.

Prevented from flying further combat missions for propaganda reasons, at the age of 28 M<U+00F6>lders was promoted to ''[[Oberst]]'', and appointed [[Inspector of Fighters|Inspector General of Fighters]].  He was inspecting the ''Luftwaffe'' units in the [[Crimea]] when he was ordered to Berlin to attend the state funeral of [[Ernst Udet]], the [[World War I]] flying ace. On the flight to Berlin, the [[Heinkel He 111]] in which he was travelling as a passenger encountered a heavy thunderstorm during which one of the aircraft's engines failed. While attempting to land, the Heinkel crashed at [[Breslau]], killing M<U+00F6>lders and two others. The German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' of the ''[[Third Reich]]'' and the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] both honoured him by naming two fighter wings, a destroyer and barracks after him.  In the 1970s&ndash;1990s, he became part of a broader discussion in Germany over remembering the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] and honouring decorated soldiers of the Third Reich.

==Childhood, education and early career==
M<U+00F6>lders was born on 18&nbsp;March 1913&nbsp;in [[Gelsenkirchen]], the son of teacher Viktor M<U+00F6>lders and his wife Annemarie, n<U+00E9>e Riedel. He was the third of four children, with an older sister, Annemarie, an older brother, Hans, and a younger brother, Victor.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 44.</ref> After his father, a [[Military reserve force|Reserve]] ''[[Leutnant]]'' in the King's 145th Infantry Regiment, was [[killed in action]] on 2&nbsp;March 1915 in the [[Forest of Argonne|Argonne Forest]] in France, his mother moved the family into her parents' house in [[Brandenburg an der Havel]].<ref name="Obermaier page31">Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 31.</ref> 

In Brandenburg, M<U+00F6>lders found a father figure in [[Chaplain]] Erich Klawitter, who instilled firm religious beliefs in him.<ref name="Obermaier page10">Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 10.</ref> From 1919&nbsp;to 1931, M<U+00F6>lders attended, first, the [[Grundschule|elementary school]] and then the Saldria-[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]], or secondary school. At school he discovered his love for water sports, especially [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]]. He joined two rowing clubs, first the ''Saldria-Brandenburg'' and later the ''Brandenburger Ruderclub'', and enjoyed success at rowing-[[regatta]]s. He was also a  member of the ''Bund Neudeutschland in der katholischen Jugendbewegung'', a [[Catholic]] youth organisation.<ref name="Obermaier page10"/> M<U+00F6>lders graduated from school in early 1931&nbsp;with the ''[[Abitur]]'' (diploma) and expressed a desire to become an officer in the armed forces.<ref name="Obermaier page31"/>

M<U+00F6>lders joined the II./2 infantry regiment of the [[Reichswehr]] in [[Allenstein]], [[Eastern Prussia]] on 1&nbsp;April 1931, serving as an officer cadet in the infantry. He attained the rank of ''[[Fahnenjunker]]''-''[[Gefreiter]]'' on 1&nbsp;October 1931, rising to ''Fahnenjunker''-''[[Unteroffizier]]'' on 1 April 1932.<ref name="Obermaier page31"/> After completing his basic military training in October 1932, he transferred to the [[Kriegsschule|Military School]] [[Dresden]]. On 1&nbsp;June 1933, he successfully completed his training in Dresden and was promoted to [[F<U+00E4>hnrich|ensign]].<ref name="Obermaier page31"/> He again was transferred, this time to the 1st Prussian Pioneer Battalion (Infantry Regiment 2) at the [[Pioneer (military)|Pioneer]] School in [[Munich]]. During his training years, M<U+00F6>lders made his first attempt to fulfil his dream of flying and volunteered for pilot training, but was declared unfit for flying. He tried again and was given conditional permission (''bedingt tauglich''&mdash;with constraints) to begin flight training.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 11.</ref>

After his promotion to ''[[Oberf<U+00E4>hnrich]]'' on 1&nbsp;February 1934, M<U+00F6>lders began his pilot training at the ''Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule'' (German transport flying school) in [[Cottbus]], lasting from 6&nbsp;February 1934 to 31&nbsp;December 1934.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 11, 32.</ref> On 1 March 1934, he was promoted to ''[[Leutnant]]'' and assigned to the recently established ''[[Luftwaffe]]''. In the early stages of his pilot training, he suffered continually from [[nausea]] and vomiting, but he eventually overcame these problems and finished the course at the top of his class. The next phase of his military pilot's training was from 1&nbsp;January 1935 to 30&nbsp;June 1935 at the combat flying school in [[Tutow]] and the fighter pilot school at [[Schlei<U+00DF>heim]] near [[Munich]]. He received the newly created [[Aviator badge#Germany|Pilot's Badge of the Luftwaffe]] on 21&nbsp;May 1935.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 11, 32, 66.</ref> 

On 1&nbsp;July 1935, ''Leutnant'' M<U+00F6>lders was posted to ''Fliegergruppe Schwerin'' (I./JG 162&nbsp;"Immelmann"). On 7&nbsp;March 1936, during the [[remilitarisation of the Rhineland]], M<U+00F6>lders and his squadron (''[[Staffel]]'') flew from [[Lippstadt]] across the [[Ruhrgebiet|Ruhr region]]; his unit was the first to arrive in [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]]. During this period, M<U+00F6>lders met Luise Baldauf, whom he was to marry a few years later, shortly before his death. On 20&nbsp;April 1936, [[Adolf Hitler]]'s birthday, numerous promotions were handed out, and M<U+00F6>lders advanced to ''[[Oberleutnant]]'', effective as of 1&nbsp;April 1936. At the same time, he became leader of the fighter training squadron of the 2nd Group of [[Jagdgeschwader 134]] "Horst Wessel". This group was under the command of ''[[Major]]'' [[Theo Osterkamp]], who became another of M<U+00F6>lders' early mentors. M<U+00F6>lders was appointed squadron leader (''[[Staffelkapit<U+00E4>n]]'') of the 1st squadron of [[Jagdgeschwader 334]] on 15&nbsp;March 1937 and served as an instructor in [[Wiesbaden]].<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 11&ndash;12, 32.</ref>

==Condor Legion==
In 1936, the Germans sent a ''Luftwaffe'' force, the [[Condor Legion]], to assist the [[Falange|Falangists]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. M<U+00F6>lders volunteered for service, and arrived by sea in [[Cadiz]] on 14&nbsp;April 1938. He was assigned to the 3rd squadron of [[Jagdgruppe 88]] (J 88) commanded by ''Oberleutnant'' [[Adolf Galland]]. The unit, stationed at the [[Valencia (province)|Valencia]]-[[Ebro]] front, was equipped with the [[Heinkel He 51]], but later switched to the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Messerschmitt Bf 109 B-2]].<!-- The He 51s were turned over to the 4th squadron, commanded by ''Hauptmann'' Eberhard d'Elsa, and continued in service until the end of the Spanish Civil War.--> M<U+00F6>lders assumed command of the squadron on 24&nbsp;May 1938, when Galland returned to Germany.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 12.</ref> He claimed his first aerial victory, shooting down a [[Polikarpov I-15]] "Curtiss" near [[Algar]], on 15&nbsp;July 1938.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 13.</ref> Over the remaining months of the year, M<U+00F6>lders became the leading ace of the Condor Legion, shooting down fifteen aircraft in Spain: two I-15&nbsp;"Chato" ("Curtiss" to the Germans), twelve I-16&nbsp;"Rata" and one [[Tupolev SB|Tupolev SB-2]] (one "Rata" claimed on 23&nbsp;September 1938&nbsp;was not confirmed).<ref name="Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 40">Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 40.</ref>

For the entire formation to execute a 90-degree right-hand turn, plane 2&nbsp;is the first plane to make the turn, rising and passing over the flight paths of planes 1, 3&nbsp;and 4. The flight path of plane 1&nbsp;is next to curve right, passing over the flight paths of planes 3&nbsp;and 4. Then the flight path of plane 3&nbsp;curves right at a 90<U+00B0> angle, passing over the path of plane 4, which is the last to turn right. Once all four planes have completed the turn, plane 2&nbsp;is to the right of plane 1, which has plane 3&nbsp;on its left, followed by plane 4&nbsp;on the far left of the formation.]]
In recognition of his exceptional performance as a commander and fighter pilot, M<U+00F6>lders was promoted to ''[[Hauptmann]]'' ([[Captain (land)|captain]]) on 18 October 1938, effective as of 1 October 1938. He claimed his 14th and final confirmed aerial victory of the conflict by downing a [[Polikarpov I-16]] "Rata" near Mola on 3 November 1938<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 12, 32.</ref> and returned to Germany on 5 December 1938.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 14, 33, 40.</ref> From 6 December 1938 until March 1939, M<U+00F6>lders was a member of the 1st group of [[Jagdgeschwader 133]] (JG 133) and held a staff position with the [[Inspector of Fighters]] at the ''[[Reichsluftfahrtministerium]]'' (Imperial Air Ministry) in Berlin. His task was to devise new fighter pilot tactics.  In March 1939 he was given command as ''[[Staffelkapit<U+00E4>n]]'' of 1./JG 133, taking over command from ''Oberleutnant'' [[Hubertus von Bonin]]. JG 133 was later renamed [[Jagdgeschwader 53]] ''Pik As'' (''Ace of Spades'').<ref name="Obermaier page33"/><ref>Prien 1997, p. 30.</ref><ref group="Notes">For an explanation of ''Luftwaffe'' unit designations see [[Luftwaffe Organisation|Organisation of the Luftwaffe during World War II]].</ref>

For his achievements in Spain, M<U+00F6>lders was honoured with the Spanish ''Medalla de la Campa<U+00F1>a'' and ''[[Medalla Militar]]'' on 4 May 1939 and the German [[Spanish Cross|Spanish Cross in Gold with Swords and Diamonds]] (''Spanienkreuz in Gold mit Schwertern und Brillanten'') on 6 June 1939.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 33, 89.</ref> The Condor Legion officially returned to Germany on 6 June 1939 and troops marched through Berlin to the [[Lustgarten]], where the fallen were honoured. A formal state [[banquet]] for the most highly decorated soldiers was held in the marble gallery of the [[Reich Chancellery]]. M<U+00F6>lders was seated at table 1, with ''[[General der Flieger]]'' [[Hugo Sperrle]], General Don Antonio Aranda, General [[Gonzalo Queipo de Llano]], ''Oberst'' [[Walter Warlimont]], ''Oberstleutnant'' von Donat, ''Leutnant'' [[Reinhard Seiler]] and ''Oberfeldwebel'' Ignatz Prestele.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 88&ndash;92.</ref>

===Tactical innovations===
With other airmen in Spain, M<U+00F6>lders developed the formation known as the "[[finger-four]]".<ref name="Spick p15" /> This improved the all-round field of vision and combat flexibility of a [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] ([[Luftwaffe Organisation#Schwarm, Rotte and Kette|''Schwarm'']]), enhanced mutual protection, and encouraged pilot initiative. In the "finger-four", the aircraft assumed positions corresponding to the fingertips of an outstretched hand. The fighters flew in two elements (''Rotten'') of two aircraft each; two ''Rotten'' (four aircraft) made up a ''Schwarm'' (swarm).<ref name="Spick p15" />

M<U+00F6>lders is often credited with inventing the cross-over turn.<ref name="Spick p15">Spick 1996, p. 15.</ref> An early version of the manoeuvre, as used by a [[V formation|"Vic"]] of five aircraft (a tight formation forming the letter "V"), appeared in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) Training Manual of 1922, and the manoeuvre may even date back to 1918. However, it had fallen into disuse due to the difficulty of performing it in a multi-aircraft formation with the contemporary spacing of less than {{convert|100|ft|m}} between aircraft. The wide lateral separation of {{convert|1800|ft|m}} introduced by J 88 both necessitated such a turning manoeuvre, to enable a swarm to turn as a unit, and minimised the risk of midair collisions previously associated with it.<ref name="Spick p15">Spick 1996, p. 15.</ref>

==World War II==
===Phoney War and the Battle of France===
At the outbreak of [[World War II]] on 1 September 1939, M<U+00F6>lders' ''Staffel'' was stationed in the west protecting Germany's border in the [[Moselle River|Mosel]]-[[Saar (protectorate)|Saar]]-[[Palatinate (region)|Pfalz]] region.<ref>Obermaier and Held, p. 14.</ref> On 8 September 1939, M<U+00F6>lders' plane suffered an engine failure; he crash-landed, flipping the aircraft over and injuring his back. The injury kept him out of combat for several days.<ref>Prien 1997, p. 40.</ref> He returned to flying on 19 September. The following day, he shot down his first aircraft of the war, a [[P-36 Hawk|Curtiss P-36]] over the [[Tripoint|three borders area]], earning the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class.<ref name="Obermaier page33"/><ref>Prien 1997, p. 44.</ref> 

On 26&nbsp;September 1939 JG 53 was ordered to form its ''III. Gruppe''. M<U+00F6>lders  relinquished command  of 1./JG 53 to ''Oberleutnant'' [[Hans-Karl Mayer]] and organized the formation of III./JG 53 at [[Wiesbaden]]-[[Erbenheim]]; within two weeks, ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' M<U+00F6>lders  reported that the ''Gruppe'' was conditionally operational with 40 pilots and 48 aircraft.<ref>Prien 1997, pp. 50&ndash;51.</ref>

By the time the [[Phoney War]] ended and Operation Case Yellow (''Fall Gelb'', the invasion of France and the [[Low Countries]] on 10&nbsp;May 1940) opened the [[Battle of France]], M<U+00F6>lders' tally of aerial victories on the western front had increased to nine. This number included one [[Bristol Blenheim]], two [[P-36 Hawk|"Curtiss" P-36 Hawks]], two [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]]s and four [[Hawker Hurricane]]s.<ref name="Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 40"/> On 14&nbsp;May, while engaging enemy bombers over [[Battle of Sedan (1940)|Sedan]], M<U+00F6>lders was shot down, but bailed out to safety.<ref>Hooton 2007, p. 65.</ref> He claimed his 19th and 20th victories on 27 May 1940, downing two "Curtiss" {{convert|15|km|mi}} southwest of [[Amiens]]. Subsequently, he became the first fighter pilot to be awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes'') and on 29 May 1940 was honourably mentioned in the ''[[Wehrmachtbericht]]'' radio report, the first of eleven such mentions.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 16.</ref>

On 5&nbsp;June 1940, on his 133rd combat mission of the war, engaging in aerial combat for the 32nd time, M<U+00F6>lders was shot down near [[Compi<U+00E8>gne]] at about 18:40 by [[sous lieutenant]] Ren<U+00E9> Pomier-Layrargues, flying a [[French Air Force]] [[Dewoitine D.520]].<ref>Hooton 2007, p. 65</ref> M<U+00F6>lders was taken prisoner but liberated three weeks later upon the armistice with France.<ref name="Obermaier page33"/> While in French captivity, M<U+00F6>lders asked to shake hands with the pilot who had shot him down, and learned that Pomier-Layrargues had been [[killed in action]] 30&nbsp;minutes after their encounter. His initial experience in French captivity was harsh; he sustained abrasions to his face and his Knight's Cross was stolen from him. A French officer, ''Capitaine'' Giron, intervened, ensured he was treated fairly, and returned the stolen medal. When a French soldier was later sentenced to death by the Germans for beating M<U+00F6>lders, M<U+00F6>lders approached [[Hermann G<U+00F6>ring]] and requested clemency, which was granted.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 16&ndash;18, 33.</ref>

Returning to Germany, M<U+00F6>lders was promoted to ''[[Major]]'' on 19&nbsp;July 1940&nbsp;and took command of [[Jagdgeschwader 51|Fighter Wing 51]] (JG 51) from the recently promoted ''[[Generalmajor]]'' [[Theo Osterkamp]] the following day.<ref>Aders and Held 1993, p. 62.</ref> M<U+00F6>lders flew his first combat sortie with JG 51&nbsp;on 28&nbsp;July, attacking a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] flown by [[Flying Officer]] Lovell.<ref name="Obermaier and Held p19"/> On this mission, according to legend, M<U+00F6>lders was hit in a dogfight over [[Dover]] by the South African ace [[Sailor Malan]], sustaining three splinter wounds in the lower leg, one in the knee and one in the left foot. ''Oberleutnant'' [[Richard Leppla]] shot down the pursuing Spitfire, and M<U+00F6>lders was able to make an emergency landing at [[Wissant]], France.<ref>Aders and Held p63</ref><ref>Kaplan 2007, p. 56.</ref> Recent research suggests M<U+00F6>lders was actually wounded in combat by [[Flight Lieutenant]] J.L. Webster&mdash;who was killed in action on 5&nbsp;September 1940&mdash;in a Spitfire of [[No. 41 Squadron RAF|41 Squadron]].<ref name="Obermaier and Held p19">Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 19.</ref><ref>Shores and Williams, p. 622.</ref> His wounds, although not serious, kept M<U+00F6>lders from further operational flying for a month. ''Generalmajor'' Osterkamp briefly led the'' Geschwader'' again during M<U+00F6>lders' convalescence. M<U+00F6>lders returned to the ''Geschwader'' on 7&nbsp;August 1940, without medical clearance for combat, to participate in [[Operation Eagle Attack]] (code name ''Adlertag''). [[Adolf Hitler]] had issued F<U+00FC>hrer Directive no. 17&nbsp;(''Weisung Nr.'' 17) on 1&nbsp;August 1940; the strategic objective was to engage and defeat the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) so as to achieve [[air superiority]] in preparation for [[Operation Sealion]] (''Unternehmen Seel<U+00F6>we''), the proposed amphibious invasion of Great Britain.<ref>Aders and Held p. 63.</ref>

M<U+00F6>lders returned to approved operational flying status and flew his next two combat missions on 28&nbsp;August 1940. His aide and wingman, ''Oberleutnant'' Kircheis, was shot down and taken [[prisoner of war]] during one of these missions; ''Oberleutnant'' Georg Claus took his place.<ref>Aders and Held 1993, p. 67.</ref> M<U+00F6>lders claimed two Hurricanes on 31 August and was mentioned again in the ''[[Wehrmachtbericht]]''.<ref>Obermaier and Held p. 19.</ref> ''Oberleutnant'' Victor M<U+00F6>lders, his younger brother, who had been appointed ''Staffelkapit<U+00E4>n'' of the 2./JG 51&nbsp;on 11&nbsp;September, was shot down and taken prisoner of war on 5 October 1940.<ref>Aders and Held 1993, pp. 69, 71.</ref> Two Spitfires of the [[No. 92 Squadron RAF]] shot down near [[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness]] on 20&nbsp;September increased M<U+00F6>lders' tally of aerial victories to 40. He was the first fighter pilot to reach this number and was awarded the 2nd [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves (mit Eichenlaub)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub'') of the war on 21&nbsp;September 1941. The award was presented by Adolf Hitler on 23&nbsp;September in the new ''[[Reichskanzlei]]'' in Berlin.  After the award ceremony, Hermann G<U+00F6>ring invited M<U+00F6>lders to his hunting lodge in the [[Rominter Heide]].<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 19&ndash;20, 34, 122.</ref>

M<U+00F6>lders returned to his unit by the end of September and continued to win aerial victories. On 11&nbsp;October M<U+00F6>lders claimed his 43rd victory.

In June 1941, JG 51&nbsp;and the majority of the ''Luftwaffe'' were transferred to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]] in preparation of [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]]. In the first day of combat operations on 22&nbsp;June 1941, M<U+00F6>lders shot down three [[Tupolev SB]] bombers and one "Curtis" Hawk, earning him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern''). M<U+00F6>lders was only the second German soldier to receive this award: [[Adolf Galland]], Fighter Squadron Commodore (''Geschwaderkommodore'') of [[Jagdgeschwader 26|Fighter Squadron 26]], had received one the day before.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 21, 41.</ref> The award was presented by Adolf Hitler on 3 July 1941 in the ''[[Wolfsschanze]]'' [[F<U+00FC>hrerhauptquartier|Hitler's Headquarters]] in [[Rastenburg]]. On 30&nbsp;June, M<U+00F6>lders had become the highest-scoring fighter pilot in the history of aerial warfare after downing five Soviet bombers<ref>Bergstr<U+00F6>m 2007, p. 27.</ref> and bringing his tally to 82, two more than the record set in [[World War I]] by the "Red Baron", [[Manfred von Richthofen]].<ref>Weal 2001, p. 22.</ref> 

On 12&nbsp;July 1941, JG 51&nbsp;under the leadership of M<U+00F6>lders reported that it had destroyed 500&nbsp;Soviet aircraft since the beginning of hostilities against the Soviets on 22&nbsp;June, and had suffered 3 casualties. That day, JG 51&nbsp;also reported its 1,200th aerial victory of the war, the credit going to ''Hauptmann'' Leppla.<ref>Aders and Held 1993, p. 91.</ref> Three days later, on 15&nbsp;July 1941, M<U+00F6>lders surpassed the ''[[100 (number)|C]]'' mark, claiming victories number 100&nbsp;and 101, and celebrated with a [[Aileron roll|victory roll]] over the airfield.<ref>Weal 2001, p. 18.</ref>   The following day he received news that he had been awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten'').<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 21, 35.</ref> M<U+00F6>lders was the first of 27&nbsp;German soldiers to receive this award. The diamonds added to the Knight's Cross were introduced officially on 28&nbsp;September 1941, more than two months after M<U+00F6>lders earned the award. M<U+00F6>lders was promoted to ''[[Oberst]]'' on 20&nbsp;July 1941, effective immediately, and banned from further combat flying. Surrendering command of JG 51&nbsp;to ''Major'' [[Friedrich Beckh]] he was transferred to the [[Reichsluftfahrtministerium|Imperial Air Ministry]], a temporary position he held until 6&nbsp;August 1941. M<U+00F6>lders was summoned to the ''Wolfsschanze'' again, where he received the Diamonds from Adolf Hitler on 26&nbsp;July 1941. On 7&nbsp;August 1941, he was appointed [[Inspector of Fighters]] (''Inspekteur der Jagdflieger'').<ref name="Obermaier&Held p35"/>

===High Command===
An ''[[Oberst]]'' at 28, M<U+00F6>lders was appointed [[Inspector of Fighters|Inspector General of Fighters]], a post responsible for deciding the ongoing tactical and operational doctrine of the ''Luftwaffe'''s fighter strategies. Returning to Russia in September 1941, he set up a command post at Chaplinka airfield, from where he flew in his personal [[Fieseler Fi 156]] ''Storch'' (stork) on tours of the [[Jagdwaffe]] and personally directed German fighter operations.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 188&ndash;189</ref>

M<U+00F6>lders also flew unofficially on missions, and actively commanded his old unit, JG 51, for several more months. On 9&nbsp;August 1941, he took Herbert Kaiser on a "teaching" mission against a formation of [[Ilyushin Il-2|Il-2 ''Stormoviks'']]. M<U+00F6>lders showed Kaiser how to shoot them down, hitting one behind the cockpit, where a fuel tank was located. The machine crashed. Kaiser then repeated what he had seen, and shot down two more.<ref>Weal 2001, p. 29.</ref> Within the next two months it is suggested M<U+00F6>lders unofficially shot down around another 30&nbsp;Soviet aircraft. At least six of M<U+00F6>lders' unofficial victories are recorded in his fellow pilots' private log books.<ref>Weal 2007, p. 11.</ref>

===Death===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2006-0127, Grab Werner M<U+00F6>lders.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Werner M<U+00F6>lders' original grave marker, 1941|alt=Black-and-white photograph of a wooden cross on a grave, bearing the inscription "Oberst Werner M<U+00F6>lders, 18. 3. 1913 <U+2013> 22. 11. 1944." The name Werner M<U+00F6>lders is in large letters. Trees are seen in the background; the area in front of the cross is covered with low-growing plants bearing flowers.]]
On 22&nbsp;November 1941, M<U+00F6>lders traveled as a passenger in a [[Heinkel He 111]] of [[Kampfgeschwader 27]] "Boelcke" from the [[Crimea]] to Germany to attend the funeral of his superior, [[Ernst Udet]]. Attempting to land at [[Breslau]] during a thunderstorm, the aircraft crashed. M<U+00F6>lders, pilot ''Oberleutnant'' Kolbe and flight engineer ''Oberfeldwebel'' Hobbie were killed. ''Major'' Dr. Wenzel and radio operator ''Oberfeldwebel'' Tenz survived the crash landing. Dr. Wenzel sustained a broken arm and leg as well as a concussion, and Tenz a broken ankle. M<U+00F6>lders' fatal injuries included a broken back and a crushed ribcage. Accident investigators then and since have speculated whether M<U+00F6>lders would have survived the crash if he had used his seat belt.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 23.</ref>

M<U+00F6>lders was given a state funeral in Berlin on 28&nbsp;November 1941. His coffin was laid out in the honour court of the [[Reichsluftfahrtministerium|Imperial Air Ministry]]. The [[guard of honour]] consisted of [[Johannes Schalk]], [[G<U+00FC>nther L<U+00FC>tzow]], [[Walter Oesau]], [[Joachim M<U+00FC>ncheberg]], [[Adolf Galland]], [[Wolfgang Falck]], [[Herbert Kaminski]] and [[Karl-Gottfried Nordmann]]. M<U+00F6>lders was buried next to [[Ernst Udet]] and [[Manfred von Richthofen]] at the ''[[Invalidenfriedhof Cemetery|Invalidenfriedhof]]'' in Berlin. The [[88 mm gun|8.8 cm flak]] in Berlin [[Tiergarten]] fired a [[21-gun salute|salute]]; [[Hermann G<U+00F6>ring]] gave the [[eulogy]].<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 200&ndash;206.</ref>

==Personal life and character==

M<U+00F6>lders was known for his strength of character.  His men nicknamed him "Vati" (Pappy), in recognition of his paternal attitude toward them, and the care he took of their well-being.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 14.</ref>  He was a devoutly religious individual who demanded that all Allied aviators captured by those under his command be treated civilly, and often would invite captured pilots to dine with him.<ref name="Weal 2006, p. 120">Weal 2006, p. 120.</ref>
  
M<U+00F6>lders married Luise Baldauf, n<U+00E9>e Thurner, the widow of a friend who had been killed in active service, on 13&nbsp;September 1941.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 22.</ref>  Erich Klawitter, M<U+00F6>lders' childhood mentor, performed the religious ceremony in [[K<U+00F6>nigstein im Taunus|Falkenstein]], [[Taunus]]. Witnesses to the wedding included ''Leutnant'' Erwin Fleig and ''Oberleutnant'' Hartmann Grasser. The marriage produced a posthumous daughter, Verena.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 35, 180&ndash;182, 209.</ref> 

Third Reich authorities disapproved of his choice of a [[Catholic marriage]] ceremony, performed by Klawitter. Klawitter had been barred from membership in the Reichskulturkammer ([[Art of the Third Reich#Creation of the Reichskulturkammer|Reich Culture Chamber]]) and was considered politically unreliable after a 1936&nbsp;breach of the [[Pulpit Law]], a remnant of the 1870s [[Kulturkampf]] that barred Catholics from criticizing the state from the pulpit.<ref>Hagena 2008, p. 54.</ref>

==Legacy==
 
Werner M<U+00F6>lders' old unit, ''Jagdgeschwader 51'', was christened "M<U+00F6>lders" in his honour, on 22&nbsp;November 1941, only hours after his death. Its members were entitled to wear the "M<U+00F6>lders" [[cuff title|cuffband]].<ref name="Obermaier&Held p35">Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 35.</ref>  His death, however, was also put to other uses.  Shortly after M<U+00F6>lders died, the British [[Intelligence agency]] dropped a [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]] over Germany. The so called ''M<U+00F6>ldersbrief'' (M<U+00F6>lders-letter) was a copy of correspondence supposedly written by M<U+00F6>lders to the [[Provost (religion)|provost]] of [[Schwerin]]. In this letter, he expressed his strong belief in [[Catholicism]] and stated that, especially in the face of death, many supporters of National Socialism still find strength and courage with Catholicism.<ref name="Hagena p67">Hagena 2008, p. 67.</ref>

M<U+00F6>lders' premature death, just shortly after Udet's own suicide, was too great an opportunity for [[Sefton Delmer]], the chief of the British [[black propaganda]] in the [[Political Warfare Executive]] (PWE), to ignore. His idea was to use M<U+00F6>lders' popularity in Germany, distributing a letter thus creating the assumption that M<U+00F6>lders strong belief led him to oppose the NS-regime in Germany. The letter was extremely well conceived. It did not bluntly call for opposition against the state. It never even mentioned the National Socialists by name but rather used metaphors like "the godless". Nevertheless every German reader knew what was meant.<ref>Hagena 2008, pp. 67&ndash;68.</ref>

The letter caused a stir in the upper echelons of the NS-regime. In his diaries, [[Joseph Goebbels]] assumed that someone in the German Catholic church organization wrote, and distributed, the letter. A bounty of 100,000 [[Reichsmark]], posted by the F<U+00FC>hrer himself, revealed no clues to its origins. Even the strongest repressive actions could not hinder the distribution of the letter.<ref name="Hagena p67"/>

===Post-war honors===

Above the inscription, there is a small Christian cross and a terracotta bowl with flowers towards the right-hand edge of the slab.]]
The ''Invalidenfriedhof'', where M<U+00F6>lders is buried, lay in [[East Berlin]] and in 1975&nbsp;[[East German]] officials ordered all the graves leveled. After the 1990&nbsp;[[German reunification]], M<U+00F6>lders' grave was rebuilt and rechristened on 11&nbsp;October 1991 by M<U+00F6>lders' school friend and ''Domherr'' of the [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral]], Heribert Rosal. The ceremony was witnessed by guests from the United States, Great Britain, Austria, Spain and Hungary.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 206.</ref><ref>Hagena 2008, p. 119.</ref> 

After the war, on 13&nbsp;April 1968, a [[destroyer]] of the ''[[Bundesmarine]]'' (Federal German Navy) was christened ''[[M<U+00F6>lders (D186)|M<U+00F6>lders]]'' in [[Bath, Maine]] (USA). It was in service between 1969 and 2003. As of 24&nbsp;June 2005, it is the central attraction at the Navy Museum in Wilhelmshaven.<ref name="Obermaier&Held p35"/>  On 9&nbsp;November 1972, a base of a Battalion of the 34th Signal Regiment of the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' (Federal German Army) in [[Visselh<U+00F6>vede]] received the name "M<U+00F6>lders".<ref name="Obermaier&Held p36">Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 36.</ref>  Most recently, the Fighter Wing 74 ([[Jagdgeschwader 74]]), stationed in [[Neuburg an der Donau]], received the name "M<U+00F6>lders" in 1973. Fighter Ace ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' [[G<U+00FC>nther Rall]] presented the cuffbands.<ref>Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 214&ndash;218.</ref>

===Reversal of Honors: Report by the Office for Military History and its consequences===
M<U+00F6>lders' career and legacy offer an example of the challenges posed in placing the heroism of the German armed forces in the post-war cultural, political and social setting.  In 1998, on the occasion of the 61st Anniversary of the bombing of the Spanish town of [[Guernica (town)|Guernica]] during the Spanish Civil War, the [[Bundestag|German Parliament]] decided that members of the Condor Legion, such as M<U+00F6>lders, should "no longer be honoured".<ref name="Obermaier&Held p36"/><ref>Hagena 2008, p. 8.</ref>  In 2005, the German Ministry of Defence (''[[Bundesministerium der Verteidigung]]'') decided to remove the name "M<U+00F6>lders" from the JG 74. The decision was confirmed  on 11&nbsp;March 2005&nbsp;by the Federal Minister of Defence [[Peter Struck]], and at 10:00&nbsp;the flags and cufftitles were removed.<ref>Hagena 2008, p. 132.</ref>    

M<U+00F6>lders' supporters challenged the ruling, and pointed out that M<U+00F6>lders had been posted to Spain well after the [[bombing of Guernica]].<ref name="Weal 2006, p. 120"/> They pointed to his equivocal political attitude towards National Socialism and his unequivocal moral commitment to Catholicism.  Not only did he have a Catholic ''religious'' marriage ceremony but Klawitter, regarded by the Third Reich as politically "unreliable," had performed the ceremony.  Furthermore, M<U+00F6>lders had joined the Catholic youth organisation ''Bund Neudeutschland'' ''(Union for New Germany)'' on 1&nbsp;October 1925&nbsp;and had been a youth leader of the organization from 1929&nbsp;to 1931. The Third Reich clearly had considered the  ''Bund Neudeutschland'' as a threat:  The ''[[V<U+00F6>lkischer Beobachter]]'' (''The People's Observer'', the official newspaper of the party) had reported on 26&nbsp;January 1938&nbsp;that  the ''Bund'' had been outlawed for its proven subversive activities against the Reich, based on the ''Verordnung des Reichspr<U+00E4>sidenten zum Schutz von Volk und Staat'' (''Imperial Presidential Decree for the Protection of People and State'') of 28&nbsp;February 1933.<ref>Hagena 2008, p. 56.</ref> Despite petitions from politicians and high-ranking active and retired servicemen, among them [[Horst Seehofer]], [[G<U+00FC>nther Rall]] and [[J<U+00F6>rg Kuebart]], the [[German Armed Forces Military History Research Office|Office for Military History]] (MGFA) noted that M<U+00F6>lders' membership in the ''Bund Neudeutschland'' did not provide sufficient evidence of his having been critical of the regime, but rather showed the contrary and  concluded that it was questionable whether M<U+00F6>lders had distanced himself enough from National Socialism before his death in 1941.  Consequently, the decision remained in force.<ref>Hagena 2008, p. 138.</ref><ref>Kaplan 2007, p. 51.</ref>

Other evidence has surfaced illustrating both M<U+00F6>lders' ambiguous relationship with the National Socialist regime. M<U+00F6>lders may have been in contact with [[bishop]] [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]], who was highly critical of the NS-regime. Von Galen publicly criticized the regime for the [[Gestapo|Gestapo's]] tactics and the deportation and [[euthanasia]] of the mentally ill. According to the diary kept by Heinrich Portmann, von Galen's secretary and chaplain, M<U+00F6>lders threatened to return his awards if von Galen's euthanasia accusation turned out to be true. Furthermore, Portmann stated that Hitler had asked M<U+00F6>lders during the presentation of the Diamonds to the Knight's Cross if there was anything he wished for. M<U+00F6>lders reportedly responded, "Please leave the bishop of M<U+00FC>nster alone." Hitler assured him that "Yes, nothing will happen to the bishop of M<U+00FC>nster." The MGFA concluded in 2005&nbsp;that this story was most likely false. The MGFA revised its position again on 28&nbsp;June 2007, concluding that there had been contact between M<U+00F6>lders and von Galen.<ref>Hagena 2008, pp. 60&ndash;64.</ref>

Evidence also demonstrates M<U+00F6>lders' propensity to value friendships over political expediency. According to Viktor M<U+00F6>lders, his brother had saved Georg K<U+00FC>ch<U+2014>one of Werner M<U+00F6>lders' closest friends, who had been classified as a [[Mischling|half-Jew]] by the [[Nuremberg Laws]]<U+2014>from death in the concentration camps. M<U+00F6>lders' and K<U+00FC>ch's friendship dated to their school days at the Saldria-Gymnasium in Brandenburg an der Havel. K<U+00FC>ch's mother, Alice n<U+00E9>e Siegel, was of Jewish birth.<ref>Hagena 2008, p. 73.</ref> K<U+00FC>ch's father, Richard K<U+00FC>ch, owned and operated a [[pharmacy]] in Brandenburg. Georg, himself a pharmacy student, was expelled from university under the Nuremberg Laws, just two semesters shy of his graduation. In 1940, Richard K<U+00FC>ch fell ill, and owning and operating the pharmacy became a bureaucratic problem for the family. Georg K<U+00FC>ch contacted his friend M<U+00F6>lders in mid-February 1941, asking for help. Werner M<U+00F6>lders immediately responded to K<U+00FC>ch on 16&nbsp;February 1941, stating that he had taken care of the matter and asking K<U+00FC>ch not to pursue the issue on his own. When Richard K<U+00FC>ch died in June 1941, his wife was able to sell the pharmacy for fair market value. Normally, since she was Jewish, it would have been confiscated.  She also remained exempt from wearing the detested [[yellow badge]] until late 1943. She was then taken to the [[Theresienstadt]] concentration camp, where she worked as a cook. Georg K<U+00FC>ch, Alice K<U+00FC>ch, and Georg's sister Friedel survived the [[Holocaust]]. Friedel K<U+00FC>ch repeatedly stated that Werner M<U+00F6>lders had been responsible for protecting the family; the mantle of his protection had persisted beyond his death.<ref>Hagena 2008, 74&ndash;83.</ref>  The [[German Armed Forces Military History Research Office|MGFA]] ruled this assertion "highly speculative," and did not investigate further.<ref>Hagena 2008, p. 72.</ref>
