'''John Baeder''' (born December 24, 1938 in South Bend, Indiana) is an American painter closely associated with the [[Photorealism|Photorealist movement]]. He is best known for his detailed paintings of American [[Roadside attraction|roadside]] diners and eateries.

==Early life==

John Baeder was born in 1938 in [[South Bend, Indiana]], but was raised in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The interest in small towns across America began when he was young by photographing old cars and other relics with a [[Brownie (camera)|Baby Brownie camera]].<ref>Virginia Anne Bonito, ''Get Real: Contemporary American Realism from the Seavest Collection'', 10-15.</ref> While attending [[Auburn University]] in the late 1950s, he made frequent trips between [[Atlanta]] and [[Alabama]], which drew his attention to rural landscapes and roadside diners.

==Early years==

He started working as an [[Art director|art director]] in Atlanta for a branch of a New York [[Advertising agency|advertising agency]] in 1960, and subsequently moved to [[New York City]] in 1964. He went on to have a successful career in advertising through the early 1970s, while continuing to paint, draw and photograph on his own time.<ref>''Pleasant Journeys and Good Eats along the Way: A Retrospective Exhibition of Paintings by John Baeder'', The Morris Museum of Art. Traditional Fine Arts Organization. http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/7aa/7aa929.htm.</ref>

One of his ad agency offices in New York City was located near the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. The museum<U+2019>s photograph department became a source of inspiration for him, especially the work of artists such as [[Berenice Abbott]], [[Walker Evans]], [[Ben Shahn]], and other photographers of the [[Farm Security Administration]]. In the late 1960<U+2019>s he also started collecting postcards of roadside America such as diners, gas stations, campsites, and motels.<ref>Virginia Anne Bonito, ''Get Real: Contemporary American Realism from the Seavest Collection'', 10-15.</ref>

==Artistic career==

Baeder left the advertising field in 1972 to pursue his artistic career full-time. The same year, [[OK Harris Gallery]] in New York began exhibiting his artworks.<ref>Steven Heller, "Why Does John Baeder Paint Diners?" The design Observer Group, http://observatory.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=11647.</ref>

Since then, he has had more than thirty solo exhibitions at art galleries such as OK Harris Gallery in New York; Modernism Gallery in San Francisco, Thomas Paul Fine Art in Los Angeles and Cumberland Gallery in Nashville, as well as a traveling retrospective exhibition titled <U+201C>Pleasant Journeys and Good Eats along The Way,<U+201D><ref>Donald Kuspit, introduction to ''Pleasant Journeys And Good Eats Along The Way: A Retrospective Exhibition Of Paintings By John Baeder'', ed. Jay Williams.</ref> which started at the [[Morris Museum of Art]] in [[Augusta, Georgia]] in December 2007.<ref><U+201C>Past Exhibitions,<U+201D> Morris Museum of Art, http://www.themorris.org/pastexhibitions.html#2007.</ref> 

His work includes oil paintings, watercolors and photographs and can be found in the permanent collections of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], the [[Cooper-Hewitt Museum]], the [[Norton Museum of Art]], the [[Denver Art Museum]], the [[Milwaukee Art Museum]], the [[High Museum of Art]], the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], the [[Yale University Art Gallery]] and the Morris Museum of Art among others. 

According to John Arthur<ref>John Arthur is an independent curator, writer, and art advisor. He has been acknowledged internationally as a leading authority on contemporary American realism and figurative art.</ref>, <U+201C>John Baeder is much more than a painter of diners. He is a knowledgeable and deeply committed chronicler of that rapidly disappearing facet of American vernacular architecture that has played such a unique role in our social and cultural history.<U+201D><ref>John Arthur, foreword to ''Diners; Revised and Updated'', by John Baeder and Vincent Scully</ref>
Baeder is the recipient of the Tennessee Governor<U+2019>s Distinguished Artist Award in 2009.<ref><U+201C>Arts Tennessee Winter/Spring 2009 Newsletter,<U+201D> Tennessee Arts Commission, http://www.arts.state.tn.us/artsTN/artstnwinter2009.pdf, 6.</ref>

He lives and works in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].
