The '''Marshalsea''' was one of the five prisons in [[Southwark]], [[London]].

Marshalsea Prison was originally the prison of the [[Marshalsea Court]]. It is not known when the original prison building, near present-day Mermaid Court, was built, but it was attacked during the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381. It declined in importance and in 1729 was housing some 300 debtors; 70 years later it was vacant and in such poor repair that it was later demolished.

The second Marshalsea Prison was built on the site of another former prison, the White Lion, just north of [[St George's, Southwark]] on [[Borough High Street]], and opened in 1811. However, its history was shortlived; it closed in 1842 when an Act of Parliament reduced the incidence of imprisonment for debt. As a [[debtor's prison]] though, the Marshalsea became notorious as the place where [[Charles Dickens]]' father was imprisoned for debt; it also features as a location in Dickens' books ''[[Little Dorrit]]'' and ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]''.

Most of the prison was finally demolished in [[1849]], but some buildings were used by an ironmonger, and later as a printing house: the Marshalsea Press. Some parts survived until the 1970s.
