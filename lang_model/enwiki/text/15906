'''''Saw VI''''' is a 2009 horror film and sequel to ''[[Saw V]]''.  It was directed by [[Kevin Greutert]] and written by [[Patrick Melton]] and [[Marcus Dunstan]], and produced by [[Mark Burg]] and [[Oren Koules]]. It is the sixth installment of the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' film series]].  It stars [[Tobin Bell]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Betsy Russell]], [[Mark Rolston]], [[Peter Outerbridge]] and [[Shawnee Smith]].  Greutert, who served as the editor for all the previous ''Saw'', made his directorial debut with ''Saw VI''. Melton and  Dunstan, the writers for both ''[[Saw IV]]'' and ''[[Saw V|V]]'', returned to write the screenplay. [[Charlie Clouser]], who provided the score for all previous ''Saw'' films, also returned to compose the score for the film. 

''Saw VI'' concludes the second trilogy of the series that focused on the posthumous effects of the [[Jigsaw Killer]] and the progression of his successor, [[Mark Hoffman (Saw)|Mark Hoffman]]. In the film, Hoffman sets up a new trap for an insurance executive, [[List of Saw characters#William Easton|William Easton]] while the FBI trails the last living Jigsaw accomplice suspect, [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]]. The film's plot has a heavy emphasis on the 2009 economic struggle of the U.S. government attempting to regulate [[healthcare in the United States|healthcare]]. 

''Saw VI'' was the first film to receive a [[Motion picture rating system#Spain|Pel<U+00ED>cula X]] rating in Spain for violence (this rating is usually reserved for [[Pornographic film|pornographic films]]), restricting screenings to eight select theaters in that country. The film was released on October 23, 2009, in North America, which followed the tradition of being released the Friday before [[Halloween]]; it also followed tradition of being released in [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]] a day earlier.

==Plot==
[[List of Saw characters#Simone and Eddie|Simone]] ([[Tanedra Howard]]) and [[List of Saw characters#Simone and Eddie|Eddie]]  (Marty Moreau), two [[Predatory lending|predatory lenders]], wake up in a room with a caged-in scale in the center, wearing head harnesses. They must tip a scale with some part of their own body to live. Simone chops her left arm off and tips the scale in her favor, saving herself. [[Mark Hoffman (Saw)|Lieutenant Mark Hoffman]] ([[Costas Mandylor]]) is called to the scene by [[List of Saw characters#Dan Erickson|Dan Erickson]] ([[Mark Rolston]]), who found [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm's]] fingerprints around the room. Erickson also shows him that [[List of Saw characters#Lindsey Perez|Lindsey Perez]] ([[Athena Karkanis]]) is alive. [[Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]] ([[Betsy Russell]]) meets with Hoffman at her clinic; he informs her that he is taking control of the games, and Jill hands him five envelopes <!-- This is shown in the theatrical version, the Director's Cut does not show how many envelopes she gives him. WikiProject Film goes by the theatrical version. --> received in the box left to her from [[Jigsaw Killer|Jigsaw]]'s ([[Tobin Bell]]) [[Will (law)|will]].

[[List of Saw characters#William Easton|William Easton]] ([[Peter Outerbridge]]), executive of a health insurance cooperation, talks with his company's attorney, [[List of Saw characters#Debbie|Debbie]] (Caroline Cave) about [[List of Saw characters#Harold Abbott|Harold]] ([[George Newbern]]), whose insurance policy was revoked after a discrepancy was found on his application and who later died from his illness.  Later that night, William is kidnapped from his office and placed in a trap, with a large [[vise]] enclosing his torso, and a [[oxygen mask]] covering his face. [[List of Saw characters#Hank|Hank]] ([[Gerry Mendicino]]), his janitor and a smoker, is in the same situation across from him. Hank is killed when he fails to hold his breath longer. In the second test, [[Billy (Saw)|Jigsaw's puppet]] informs William that he must choose to save either his file clerk [[List of Saw characters#Allen|Allen]] (Shawn Ahmed) or his secretary [[List of Saw characters#Addy|Addy]] (Janelle Hutchison), and let the other die.  In the end, William chooses to save Addy, and Allen is hanged by a [[barbed wire]] [[noose]] when his platform retracts. His third test takes place in a large boiler room.  Debbie stands at the bottom of a caged-in maze with a device on her chest set to fire a spear through her head.  At the end of the maze, she discovers through X-ray films that the key has been implanted in William's side, and attacks him with a circular saw, but fails to before the timer runs out and kills her. In his final test, William finds his [[List of Saw characters#Carousel Room Victims|six staff members]] chained to a spinning [[carousel]] with a shotgun pointed towards each person, but he can only choose to save two of the six by pushing buttons in a device that will drive spikes into his hand and divert the shotgun upward. He reluctantly chooses to save Emily and Shelby.

Meanwhile, Erickson and Perez inform Hoffman that abnormalities were found in Strahm's fingerprints, and that the scrambled voice from the [[List of Saw characters#Seth Baxter|Seth Baxter]] tape did not match Jigsaw's. They lead Hoffman to the site where the voice is being unscrambled by a technician. The moment Hoffman's voice is unscrambled from the tape, he kills all three of them and sets the room ablaze, using Strahm's hand to plant his fingerprints. [[List of Saw characters#Tara and Brent Abbott|Tara and Brent]] ([[Shauna MacDonald]] and [[Devon Bostick]]) wake up in one locked cage, while reporter [[List of Saw characters#Pamela Jenkins|Pamela Jenkins]] (Samantha Lemole) wakes up in another.  When Hoffman returns to the observation room, he finds a letter that Jill has placed on the desk, which he himself had written to blackmail [[Amanda Young]] ([[Shawnee Smith]]), while Jill enters suddenly and [[Electric shock|shock]]s him, while William simultaneously reaches the end of his path, finding himself between the two cages. It is shown that he and Pamela are brother and sister, while Tara and Brent are the family of Harold Abbott. Now they can choose to either kill William or set him free using a marked switch next to the tank.  Brent shifts the switch to "Die", and a platform of needles swings into William's back, pumping [[hydrofluoric acid]] into his body and killing him. Jill straps Hoffman to the chair and places a modified "Reverse Bear-Trap" on his head. She leaves Hoffman with a 45 second timer; he escapes the chair by breaking his hand, and manages pull his head free with one side of his mouth ripped open.

Greutert explained that the traps in ''Saw VI'' would take a more violent and personal approach than previous films.  When compared to ''Saw IV'' and ''V'' where most of the traps were set in big rooms and involved more people at one time, he stated that the traps or "games" in ''Saw VI'' would be more personal to the victims and would be more one-on-one with the trap.<ref name="B-D Chats With the Cast and Crew"/> David Armstrong thinks visually, it might be his favorite saying, "We're kind of pulling back a little bit in the color palette. It's going to be more suggestive and not so vibrant, in your face like III and IV. It's more neutral and shows natural flesh tones. On SAW V, I pulled back a little bit and on this one, I pulled back even more."<ref name="B-D Chats With the Cast and Crew"/> Also, the film has traps that pit victims against each other, similar to the [[mausoleum]] scene from ''Saw IV''.<ref name="convo with filmmakers"/>

[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said that "''Saw VI'' is the thinnest, draggiest, and most tediously preachy of the ''Saw'' films. It's the first one that's more or less consumed by backstory <U+2014> which is to say, it's one of those hollow franchise placeholders in which far too many fragments from the previous sequels keep popping up in flashbacks." He went on to write "If your goal is to do a quick study for a round of ''Saw [[Trivial Pursuit]]'', then this may be the movie for you. If you're looking to be jolted into fear or queasy laughter, skip this sequel and hope that the producers get their sick act together next time."<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20315066,00.html| author=[[Owen Gleiberman|Gleiberman, Owen]] | title=Saw VI Review (2009) | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | publisher=[[Time Warner]] | date=October 23, 2009 <!-- | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5n3nUcWjW | archivedate=January 25, 2010 -->}}</ref> Rob Nelson of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote "Squeezing another pint of blood from its torture-porn corpus, Lionsgate slays again with "Saw VI," a film so frighteningly familiar it could well be called "Saw It Already." At least the requisite moralism is more playful than pious in this edition," but went on to praise first time director Kevin Greutert's directing stating "Presumably owing to director Kevin Greutert's work as editor of all five previous "Saw" pics, the film's juggling of chronology is the franchise's best -- "downright slick," as Jigsaw would say."<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117941442.html?categoryid=3478&cs=1 | author=[http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=bio&peopleID=3812 Nelson, Rob]| title=Saw VI Movie Review | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] | date=October 23, 2009 | accessdate=December 8, 2009 <!-- | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5n3nfI0IX | archivedate=January 25, 2010 -->}}</ref>
Robert Abele of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote "But, really, do reformers and victims of callous health insurers really want a guy with a penchant for elaborately constructed death panels of his own to be their advocate? Elsewhere, the usual critiques apply: terrible acting, zero suspense, laughable logic and the promise of another one next year. How can we get this policy canceled?"<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-saw23-2009oct24,0,7260800.story | last=Abele | first=Robert | title='Saw VI' takes a stab at healthcare reform | work=Los Angeles Times | publisher=Tribune Company | date=October 24, 2009 | accessdate=December 8, 2009 <!-- | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5n3nmSFh6 | archivedate=January 25, 2010 -->}}</ref>

Christopher Monfette of [[IGN|IGN Movies]] rated ''Saw VI'' three out of five and wrote that "while ''Saw VI'' certainly offers a redemption for the series and the promise of a coming power struggle for Jigsaw's legacy, ''Saw VII'' will no doubt mark the time to either shake things up or watch this franchise get the ax".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/103/1038167p1.html | title=Saw VI Review at IGN | last=Monfette | first=Christopher | work=IGN Entertainment | publisher=News Corporation |  | date=October 23, 2009 | accessdate=December 8, 2009 <!-- | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5n3nq7AAS | archivedate=January 25, 2010 -->}}</ref>  Kim Newman of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' gave ''Saw VI'' 3 out of 5, stating "''Saw VI'' gets back to ''Saw'' basics in gripping, gruesome manner."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=136589 | title=Review of Saw VI | last=Newman | first=Kim | work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]] | date=October 25, 2009 | accessdate=December 8, 2009 <!-- | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5n3o1Itnw  | archivedate=January 25, 2010 -->}}</ref> Blake French of [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC Filmcritic]] gave ''Saw VI'' three and a half out of 5, stating "Director Kevin Greutert hasn't helmed a lot of films in the past, but he did edit all of the previous ''Saw''s.
