==History==
===Early years===
Fall Out Boy was formed in early 2001 by friends Joe Trohman and Pete Wentz. The two had played in various bands in the Chicago area. They decided they wanted to start a band that was similar to bands they listened to growing up such as [[Green Day]], [[Descendents (band)|Descendents]], and [[The Smiths]].
Trohman met high schooler Patrick Stump in a Borders Bookstore.<ref>{{cite web |title=Joe Trohman |work=[[TV.com]] |date=[[September 19]] [[2006]] |url=http://www.tv.com/joe-trohman/person/412087/biography.html |accessdate = 2007-08-03}}</ref> Trohman introduced himself to Stump when he overheard him talking about the band [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]], in which they shared a mutual interest.<ref name=PSJournal>{{cite web |last=Stump |first=Patrick |title=Patrick Stump's Journal |work=GreatestCities.com (Cached version) |url=http://64.233.169.104/search?q=cache:MdcS9zYvylIJ:www.greatestcities.com/users/xpatrickx/ |accessdate = 2007-08-03}}</ref> Stump auditioned as a drummer, but as soon as his vocal range was discovered, he became the lead singer.<ref>{{cite video | people = Fall Out Boy (2004) | title = My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue | medium = DVD | publisher = Fueled By Ramen | date = 2004 }}</ref> Two other Chicago musicians were recruited; T.J.

According to a recent interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', the band already has an album's worth of material ready to put out, but has yet to record.<ref>Graff, Gary ([[October 22]] [[2007]]).

There'll be some weird stuff, but at the end of the day, it's probably just gonna be a pop record." Also, according to Wentz's journal on the group's website, the album is going to be "raprock", although this was likely a joke.<ref>[http://www.falloutboyrock.com/falloutboy/blog_detail.php?uf_item_id=2-1644882&uf_system_id=2 Fall Out Boy's Website]</ref>

On [[January 14]], [[2008]], [[MTV]] interviewed [[Pete Wentz]] about the ''[[Infinity on High]]'' follow-up album. Wentz revealed the album has [[folk music|folk]] styles, but it is not essentially a folk album.

On [[March 18]], it was revealed that Fall Out Boy would play a show in [[Antarctica]] to go into the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the only band to play a concert on all seven continents in less than nine months. The band played a [[March 23]] show in [[Santiago, Chile]] in [[South America]],<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1583605/20080318/fall_out_boy.jhtml "Fall Out Boy To Play Antarctica For World Record" - MTV]</ref> but the group found that weather conditions would not permit them to play in Antarctica.

In May 2008, [[Pete Wentz]] announced that he would be hosting [[FNMTV]], a new show on [[MTV]]. The title, originally "F'N MTV, "was later changed to "FNMTV" and a premiere date of June 13, 2008 was set.  Wentz did an interview with [[AbsolutePunk.net]] in early June and explained that "FNMTV" would consist of music video world premieres, live performances "with no lip syncing", interactive audience participation, and vintage videos.  "It's going to be only world premieres, so it's going to be the first time you ever see the video on TV. For example, this Snoop Dogg video is a country song that he did with Willie Nelson, and that's the first time that anyone's going to see it on TV," he explained.<ref>{{cite web | last=Pascarella | first=Tony | title=Pete Wentz Interview | work=Absolutepunk.net | date=2008-06-06 | url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=331771| accessdate = June 11 | accessyear=2008}}</ref>

On [[June 24]], [[2008]] in an interview with MTV news, Pete Wentz stated that the band has about 3 or 4 songs which are just ideas as of now.  Wentz said "It's early, but the ideas we've got right now, they're really guitar-riff-heavy. A lot of other bands, like AC/DC or the White Stripes, you know their songs by the opening guitar riff, so basically, I want our record to be like an AC/DC album or a White Stripes album. I want to make sure the bloggers say that. Actually, I'm just kidding about that. Well, I was kidding about the White Stripes part. Not AC/DC."  It was also announced that the producer of the album would be Neal Avron, in whose house the band is currently working on new material.  Wentz said that they plan to start recording this summer and hope to release the album before the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=761952|title=Fall Out Boy: Guitar Heroes?|date=2008-06-24|publisher=FMBQ|accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref>

Currently, [[Patrick Stump]] is in post-production on a short film co-produced by Paul Klinke and Tobin Nageotte of [[thirtysevenclick]]. The film is titled [["Moustachette"]] and stars Stump and [[Ryan Key]] of the band [[Yellowcard]]. Stump wrote, directed, and executive produced. <ref>http://www.patrickstump.com</ref> The plot centers around illegal penguin poaching in South America. <ref>http://www.buzznet.com/groups/icanhazmustache/forum/topics/309591/the-moustachette/</ref> It's rumored the production went wildly over budget and schedule due to problems with the filtration system on the penguin set. Patrick also held the role of Marty Dreshler in an episode of [[Law and Order]] entitled "Darkness." He was not compensated for his appearance on the show.

Also, the band has collaborated with rapper [[T.I.]] for his upcoming album, on a song called "Out in the Cold." Pete Wentz noted of the song, something from ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''. After hearing about the chance to do a collaboration with someone like T.I., we thought, 'How amazing would it be to send him something with strings and a Danny Elfman-like intro that Patrick came up with?' Lyrically you can take it as [being about] a friend, a lover, or even a fan."<ref>Thompson, Paul.

Pete Wentz was interviewed for a retrospective article in ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' when The Get Up Kids disbanded in 2005, and stated that "Fall Out Boy would not be a band if it were not for the Get Up Kids."<ref>"Say Goodnight, Mean Goodbye: The Oral History of [[The Get Up Kids]]" [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|''Alternative Press'']] issue #204.<!-- Where's the date of publication, the page number(s) and author? --></ref> Fall Out Boy's main songwriters are Patrick Stump (melody) and Pete Wentz (lyrics), though they traditionally credit the whole band as songwriters. Their albums ''[[Take This To Your Grave]]'' and ''[[From Under The Cork Tree]]'' are both said to have [[pop punk]] as well as [[punk rock]] sounds and influences,<ref>{{citeweb |last=Loftus |first=Johnny |title=Take This To Your Grave |work=[[Allmusic]] |url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:dzfyxq8ald6e |accessdate = July 20 |accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref name=Cork>{{cite web |last=Loftus |first=Johnny |title=From Under The Cork Tree |work=[[Allmusic]] |url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:0xfexq9sldje |accessdate = July 20 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> and their latest work, ''[[Infinity On High]]'', features a wide range of styles and instrumentation, including orchestral and choral arrangements ("[[Thnks fr th Mmrs]]", "[[You're Crashing, But You're No Wave]]") and a slower piano ballad ("[[Golden (song)|Golden]]"). The band has shown signs of experimentation, working with [[hip hop]] producers and artists, including [[Timbaland]], [[Lil Wayne]] and [[Kanye West]], and have also been influenced by [[R&B]] music.{{fact|date=May 2008}} In general, the group has direct ties to melodic [[pop music]], with Patrick Stump becoming a producer aside from his work with the band, and they also are closely connected to [[hardcore punk]], as evident in their use of throat vocals and their prior involvement in the underground Chicago music scene.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web | last=Loftus | first=Johnny | title=Biography: Fall Out Boy | work= Allmusic| url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kzfexqw0ldte~T1 | date=2007 | accessdate = May 11 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Moreover, a central part of Fall Out Boy's sound is rooted in the band's lyrics, mainly penned by bassist Pete Wentz, who commonly uses irony and other literary devices to narrate personal experience and stories.<ref name=Cork />
