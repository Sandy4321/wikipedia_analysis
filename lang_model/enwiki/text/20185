'''Timothy Scott Baker''' (born September 19, 1981) is an American professional [[baseball]] [[starting pitcher]] who is a free agent. He stands {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m}} tall and weighs {{convert|215|lb|kg}}. He has played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[Minnesota Twins]], [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. He bats and throws right-handed.

Baker grew up in [[Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]], and attended [[Oklahoma State University - Stillwater|Oklahoma State University]]. He was drafted by the [[Minnesota Twins]] in the second round of the [[2003 Major League Baseball Draft|2003 amateur entry draft]] and reached the Major Leagues in 2005. In 2006, he made their [[starting rotation]] out of [[Spring Training]] but struggled and was sent to the minor leagues for most of the rest of the season. Beginning 2007 in the minors, he was called up in May and nearly threw a [[perfect game]] on August 31. He went 11&ndash;4 in 2008 and posted a 3.45 [[earned run average]] (ERA). In 2009, Baker logged a career-high 200 innings and started the [[American League]] (AL) tiebreaker game against the [[Detroit Tigers]] which the Twins won to advance to the postseason. He had a 12&ndash;9 record in 2010 but battled injuries towards the end of the year and was left out of the Twins' postseason rotation. Injuries limited Baker in 2011 again, but he was the only Twins' pitcher to post a winning record. He missed 2012 after undergoing [[Tommy John surgery]]; this injury also caused him to miss most of 2013, which he spent with the [[Chicago Cubs]]. He began 2014 in the minor leagues but was later added to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]' roster.

==High school/college years==
Baker was born September 19, 1981, in [[Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]]. He attended [[Captain Shreve High School]] in Shreveport, graduating in 2000. He was selected to the All-State team his senior year and played college baseball at [[Oklahoma State University - Stillwater|Oklahoma State University]]. In the 2001 season, he was named a [[Louisville Slugger]] Freshman All-American. In the 2003 season, he was named second team All-Big 12.<ref name="MLB">{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=435044 |title=Scott Baker Stats, Video Highlights, Photos, Bio |work=[[MLB.com]] |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref>

==Major league career==

===Minnesota Twins===

====2005 season====
Baker was called up on May 3, 2005, following an injury to [[Kyle Lohse]]; Twins' manager [[Ron Gardenhire]] said he might be used to start if Lohse did not continue to improve.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sheldon |first=Mark |url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050503&content_id=1037013&vkey=news_min&fext=.jsp&c_id=min |title=Notes: Lohse tests sore shoulder |work=[[MLB.com|Twins.MLB.com]] |date=May 3, 2005 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref> Baker did not wind up starting, making his Major League debut by pitching one scoreless inning out of the [[bullpen]] in an 8-1 victory over the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] on May 7.<ref>{{cite web |last=Simonetti |first=Thomas |url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050507&content_id=1041798&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=min |title=Twins' fifth-inning tug unravels Kazmir |work=[[MLB.com|Twins.MLB.com]] |date=May 7, 2005 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref> That was his only appearance before he was returned to Rochester on May 11.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sheldon |first=Mark |url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050511&content_id=1046461&vkey=news_min&fext=.jsp&c_id=min |title=Notes: Baker enjoyed big league taste |work=[[MLB.com|Twins.MLB.com]] |date=May 11, 2005 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref>   He was recalled again in July to make a start in place of [[Brad Radke]], who was nursing an injury.<ref>{{cite web |last=Tang |first=Gerald |url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050703&content_id=1113693&vkey=news_min&fext=.jsp&c_id=min |title=Notes: Baker ready for first MLB start |work=[[MLB.com|Twins.MLB.com]] |date=July 3, 2005 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref> On July 5, he made his first Major League start by going five innings while giving up just two runs on five hits and striking out five; however, he took the loss in a 2-1 defeat against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]]. Gardenhire had praise for him, saying after the game, "We think we have a quality Major Leaguer ready to go, ready to pitch in the Major Leagues. He kind of proved that theory again tonight."<ref>{{cite web |last=Sheldon |first=Mark |url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050705&content_id=1117174&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=min |title=Twins can't whip up support for Baker |work=[[MLB.com|Twins.MLB.com]] |date=July 6, 2005 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref>  A few weeks later, on July 23, Baker had his first career win in Detroit with a 5-2 victory over the [[Detroit Tigers|Tigers]]. He started and pitched seven strong innings, allowing just two runs, but was sent back to Rochester immediately after the game as part of a premeditated plan.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sheldon |first=Mark |url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050723&content_id=1141898&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=min |title=Twins' bats wake up for Baker in nightcap |work=[[MLB.com|Twins.MLB.com]] |date=July 23, 2005 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref>

Baker split time in 2005 between the Twins and Rochester. On August 29, he returned to the Twins starting rotation for the remainder of the year, making seven consecutive starts to close the season as he replaced the struggling [[Joe Mays]] in the rotation.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sheldon |first=Mark |url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050829&content_id=1188708&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=min |title=Baker sifts through Royals in opener |work=[[MLB.com|Twins.MLB.com]] |date=August 30, 2005 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref>  Baker finished his rookie year with a record of 3-3 and an ERA of 3.35.<ref name="MLB"/>

====2006 season====
Baker beat out [[Francisco Liriano]] to earn the Twins' No. 5 starting spot out of [[Spring Training]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Thesier |first=Kelly |url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060328&content_id=1364993&vkey=spt2006news&fext=.jsp&c_id=min |title=Notes: Baker looks to be No. 5 starter |work=[[MLB.com|Twins.MLB.com]] |date=March 28, 2006 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref> But he struggled with his command, unable to keep the ball down, and did not live up to the expectations following his rookie season. The 2&ndash;5 start with a 6.06 ERA caused Baker to be demoted to Rochester on June 1.<ref>{{cite web |last=Thesier |first=Kelly |url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060601&content_id=1483469&vkey=news_min&fext=.jsp&c_id=min |title=Notes: Baker optioned to Triple-A |work=[[MLB.com|Twins.MLB.com]] |date=June 1, 2006 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref>

Baker ended up spending nearly the entire second half with the Rochester Red Wings, making only a handful of starts after the demotion. While the Twins played great baseball after a 25-33 start by winning the division on the last game of the regular season, Baker's season was a major disappointment. He finished the year with a 5-8 record and a 6.37 ERA in 83.1 innings, with two of the wins coming against the [[New York Yankees]]. Baker did not make the Twins' postseason roster.<ref name="MLB"/>

====2007 season====
Baker failed to legitimately contend for the Twins' rotation in 2007, opening the season with Rochester.<ref>{{cite web |last=Thesier |first=Kelly |url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070324&content_id=1857928&vkey=spt2007news&fext=.jsp&c_id=min |title=Pitching choices abound this year |work=[[MLB.com|Twins.MLB.com]] |date=March 25, 2007 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref> But in May, the Twins removed [[Sidney Ponson]] from the rotation, giving Baker a chance to start again. In his first start of the season, on May 19, he pitched into the ninth inning, allowing two runs in a 5&ndash;2 victory over the [[Milwaukee Brewers]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Thesier |first=Kelly |url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070519&content_id=1974367&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=min |title=Twins boost Baker to beat Brewers |work=[[MLB.com|Twins.MLB.com]] |date=May 19, 2007 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref> On July 26, after scuffling in several starts, he struck out a career-high nine hitters over seven innings in a 12-inning, 2&ndash;1 victory over the [[Toronto Blue Jays]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Thesier |first=Kelly |url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070626&content_id=2051094&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=min |title=Cirillo delivers in a pinch |work=[[MLB.com|Twins.MLB.com]] |date=June 27, 2007 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref> He pitched a [[complete game]] on July 1, allowing only a home run to [[Marcus Thames]], but that run was the only run of the game in a 1&ndash;0 loss to Detroit.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kirby |first=Tim |url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070701&content_id=2061896&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=min |title=Baker outdueled in loss to Tigers |work=[[MLB.com|Twins.MLB.com]] |date=July 2, 2007 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref> He threw eight shutout innings on August 5, earning the victory in a 1&ndash;0 win over the [[Cleveland Indians]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Parker |first=Leslie |url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070805&content_id=2131395&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=min |title=Baker shuts down Tribe at the Dome |work=[[MLB.com|Twins.MLB.com]] |date=August 5, 2007 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref> On August 31, 2007, Baker took a [[perfect game]] into the ninth inning against the [[Kansas City Royals]] at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] during the second game of a doubleheader, but lost his bid for perfection when he issued a [[base on balls|walk]] to the first batter he faced in the ninth, [[John Buck (baseball)|John Buck]]. The second hitter after Buck that he faced, [[Mike Sweeney]], hit a single, ending Baker's bid for a [[no-hitter]]. Baker finished the game by beating the Royals 5-0 allowing just one hit and completing his second complete game of his career.<ref>{{cite web |last=Parker |first=Leslie |url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070831&content_id=2181574&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=min |title=Baker spins one-hitter after near no-no |work=[[MLB.com|Twins.MLB.com]] |date=September 1, 2007 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref> In 24 games, 23 of which were starts, Baker had a 9&ndash;9 record, a 4.26 ERA, and 102 strikeouts in {{frac|143|2|3}} innings.<ref name="MLB"/>

====2008 season====
Baker was limited to two games in 2008 Spring Training by a strained lat muscle and the flu, but he again made the Twins' rotation.<ref>{{cite web |last=Thesier |first=Kelly |url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080330&content_id=2467119&vkey=news_min&fext=.jsp&c_id=min |title=Baker rotation-bound with flying colors |work=[[MLB.com|Twins.MLB.com]] |date=March 30, 2008 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref> He won his first two starts of the season, April 4 and April 9. From May 7 to June 5, he was on the [[disabled list]] (DL) with a strained right groin, the first DL stint of his career.<ref name="MLB"/> On June 15, 2008, Baker became the first Minnesota Twins pitcher to ever throw four strikeouts in the same inning. In the 3rd inning against the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], Baker struck out [[Ryan Braun]], then struck out [[Prince Fielder]], but the ball bounced away from catcher [[Mike Redmond]], so Fielder went to first base. Baker then proceeded to strike out [[Russell Branyan]] and [[Mike Cameron]]. The last pitcher to record such a feat was [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] pitcher [[Brad Penny]], who did it on September 23, 2006 against the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3444963 |title=Baker first Twin to strike out four (Brewers) in single inning |accessdate=February 10, 2009|agency=Associated Press |date=June 15, 2008|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref>

====2009 season====
Baker was expected to be the Twins' [[Opening Day]] starter, but he opened the 2009 season on the disabled list with right shoulder stiffness and struggled in his return, posting a 9.15 ERA in his first four starts.<ref name="MLB"/><ref name="2008 Baker"/> On May 3, he appeared to be improving when he no-hit the Royals through six innings, but he gave up five runs in the seventh inning of that game.

==Pitching style==
Through the 2011 season, Baker threw six pitches: a [[four-seam fastball]], his lead pitch (89<U+2013>94&nbsp;mph); a [[two-seam fastball]] (88<U+2013>93&nbsp;mph); a [[cut fastball]] (mid 80s); a [[slider]] (low 80s); a [[curveball]] (79<U+2013>81&nbsp;mph); and a [[changeup]] (low 80s). His repertoire against right-handed hitters is mostly four-seamer/slider, while against lefties he throws the two-seamer, as well. The cutter, curveball, and changeup are infrequent offerings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brooksbaseball.net/player_cards/player_card.php?player=435044|title=Brooks Baseball <U+00B7> Home of the PitchFX Tool - Player Card: Scott Baker|publisher=Brooks Baseball|accessdate=November 27, 2012}}</ref>

Since Baker's return in 2013, his average fastball velocity has dropped to the high eighties, and he has been reluctant to throw the curveball, not using it at all in 2014 as of June 4.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=6176&position=P |title=Scott Baker |work=Fangraphs |accessdate=June 4, 2014}}</ref>

Baker has been a good control pitcher throughout his career, finishing in the top 10 in the American League in [[strikeout-to-walk ratio]] ratio three times.<ref name="reference">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bakersc02.shtml|title=Scott Baker Statistics and History|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=27 November 2012}}</ref> He has the fourth-best strikeout-to-walk ratio in the history of the Twins, including their time as the [[Washington Senators (1901<U+2013>1960)|Washington Senators]], at 3.438 (behind Slowey's 4.702, [[Jim Merritt]]'s 3.904, and [[Johan Santana]]'s 3.794); he also has the eighth-best [[strikeouts per 9 innings pitched]] number in Twins' history (7.234).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/MIN/leaders_pitch.shtml |title=Minnesota Twins Top 10 Pitching Leaders |work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |accessdate=June 4, 2014}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Baker is known for being soft-spoken.<ref>{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Kelsie |url=http://www.twincities.com/sports/ci_6776960 |title=Stressful weeks come to an almost perfect end |work=TwinCities.com |date=September 1, 2007 |accessdate=June 4, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Neal III|first=La Velle E.|url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/blogs/154472845.html|title=Twins-Tigers: First pitch scheduled for 1:30 p.m. |work=startribune.com |deadurl=no |date=May 26, 2012 |accessdate=August 12, 2012}}</ref> Since a "young age," Baker has been a Christian. He says, "I can't tell you how much I appreciated my parents for [bringing me to church]" and that he is "eternally grateful." He especially enjoys Paul's letters to the churches, saying, "It gives you hope... insight... peace in our daily lives."<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Scott Baker |year=2008 |title=Scott Baker talking about his faith  |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwNhSVRLxzE |medium=video |accessdate=June 4, 2014 |publisher=YouTube}}</ref>
