{{History of Scotland}}

'''Romanticism in Scotland''' was a complex artistic, literary and intellectual movement that developed between the late eighteenth and the early nineteenth centuries. It was part of the wider European [[Romantic movement]], which was partly a reaction against the [[Age of Enlightenment]], emphasising individual, national and emotional responses, moving beyond [[Renaissance]] and [[Classicist]] models, particularly to the Middle Ages. 

In the arts Romanticism manifested itself in literature and drama in the adoption of the mythical bard [[Ossian]], the exploration of national poetry in the work of [[Robert Burns]] and in the historical novels of [[Walter Scott]]. Scott also had a major impact on the development of a national Scottish drama. Art was heavily influenced by Ossian and a new view of the Highlands as the location of a wild and dramatic landscape. Scott had a profound impact on architecture through his re-building of [[Abbotsford House]] in the early nineteenth century, which set off the boom in the [[Scots Baronial]] revival. In music, Burns was part of an attempt to produce a canon of Scottish song, which resulted in a cross fertilisation of Scottish and continental classical music, with romantic music becoming dominant in Scotland into the twentieth century. 

Intellectually Scott and figures like [[Thomas Carlyle]] played a part in the development of historiography and the idea of the historical imagination. Romanticism also had an impact on science, particularly the life sciences, geology, optics and astronomy, giving Scotland a prominence in these areas that continued into the late nineteenth century. Scottish philosophy was dominated by [[Scottish Common Sense Realism]], which shared some characteristics with Romanticism and was a major influence on the development of [[Transcendentalism]]. Scott also played a major part in defining Scottish and British politics, helping to create a romanticised view of Scotland and the Highlands that fundamentally changed Scottish national identity.

Romanticism began to subside as a movement in the 1830s, but it continued to have a significant impact in areas such as music until the early twentieth century. It also had a lasting impact on the nature of Scottish identity and outside perceptions of Scotland.

Romanticism was a complex artistic, literary, and intellectual movement that originated in the second half of the eighteenth century in western Europe, and gained strength during and after the [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial]] and [[French Revolution]]s.<ref name=Chandler1971p4>A. Chandler, ''A Dream of Order: the Medieval Ideal in Nineteenth-Century English Literature'' (London: Taylor & Francis, 1971), p. 4.</ref> It was partly a revolt against the political norms of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] which rationalised nature, and was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature,<ref name=Chandler1971p4/> but had a major impact on historiography,<ref>David Levin, ''History as Romantic Art: Bancroft, Prescott, and Parkman'' (1967).</ref> philosophy<ref>S.

Romanticism has been seen as "the revival of the life and thought of the Middle Ages", reaching beyond [[Rationalism|rational]] and [[Classicism|Classicist]] models to elevate medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived to be authentically medieval, in an attempt to escape the confines of population growth, urban sprawl and industrialism, embracing the exotic, unfamiliar and distant.<ref>R. R. Agrawal, ''The Medieval Revival and its Influence on the Romantic Movement'' (Abhinav, 1990), p. 1.</ref> It is also associated with political revolutions, beginning with those in [[American Revolution|Americana]] and [[French Revolution|France]] and movements for independence, particularly in [[History of Poland (1795<U+2013>1918)|Poland]], [[Peninsular War|Spain]] and [[Greek War of Independence|Greece]]. It is often thought to incorporate an emotional assertion of the self and of individual experience along with a sense of the infinite, [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] and [[Sublime (literary)|sublime]]. In art there was a stress on imagination, landscape and a spiritual correspondence with nature. It has been described by [[Margaret Drabble]] as "an unending revolt against classical form, conservative morality, authoritarian government, personal insincerity, and human moderation".<ref name=Drabble/>

Although after [[Acts of Union 1707|union with England]] in 1707 Scotland increasingly adopted English language and wider cultural norms, its literature developed a distinct national identity and began to enjoy an international reputation. [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] (1686<U+2013>1758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the [[Habbie stanza]] as a [[poetic form]].<ref>J. Buchan, ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), ISBN 0-06-055888-1, p. 311.</ref> [[James Macpherson]] (1736<U+2013>96) was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation. Claiming to have found poetry written by the ancient bard [[Ossian]], he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] [[Epic poetry|epics]]. ''Fingal'', written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its appreciation of natural beauty and treatment of the ancient legend has been credited more than any single work with bringing about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German, literature, through its influence on [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].<ref>J. Buchan, ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), ISBN 0-06-055888-1, p. 163.</ref> It was also popularised in France by figures that included [[Napoleon]].<ref>H.

[[Robert Burns]] (1759<U+2013>96) and [[Walter Scott]] (1771<U+2013>1832) were highly influenced by the Ossian cycle. Burns, an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is widely regarded as the [[national poet]] of Scotland and a major influence on the Romantic movement. His poem (and song) "[[Auld Lang Syne]]" is often sung at [[Hogmanay]] (the last day of the year), and "[[Scots Wha Hae]]" served for a long time as an unofficial [[national anthem]] of the country.<ref>L.

Scotland was also the location of two of the most important literary magazines of the era, ''[[The Edinburgh Review]]'' (founded in 1802) and ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' (founded in 1817), which had a major impact on the development of British literature and drama in the era of Romanticism.<ref>A.

[[File:Theatre Royal, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Theatre Royal, Edinburgh]], as it was from 1769<U+2013>1830]]
Scottish "national drama" emerged in the early 1800s, as plays with specifically Scottish themes began to dominate the Scottish stage. Theatres had been discouraged by the [[Church of Scotland]] and fears of Jacobite assemblies. In the later eighteenth century, many plays were written for and performed by small amateur companies and were not published and so most have been lost. Towards the end of the century there were "[[closet dramas]]", primarily designed to be read, rather than performed, including work by Scott, Hogg, Galt and [[Joanna Baillie]] (1762<U+2013>1851), often influenced by the ballad tradition and [[Gothic literature|Gothic]] Romanticism.<ref name=Brown2007pp229-30>I.

The Scottish national drama that emerged in the early nineteenth century was largely historical in nature and based around a core of adaptations of Scott's Waverley novels.<ref name=Brown2007pp229-30/> The existing repertoire of Scottish-themed plays included Shakespeare's ''[[Macbeth (play)|Macbeth]]'' (c. 1605), [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Maria Stuart]]'' (1800), [[John Home]]'s ''[[Douglas (play)|Douglas]]'' (1756) and Ramsay's ''[[The Gentle Shepherd]]'' (1725), with the last two being the most popular plays among amateur groups. Ballets with Scottish themes included ''Jockey and Jenny'' and ''Love in the Highlands''.<ref name=Brown2007p231>I.

Also adapted for the stage were ''[[Guy Mannering]]'', ''[[The Bride of Lammermoor]]'' and ''[[The Abbot]]''. These highly popular plays saw the social range and size of the audience for theatre expand and helped shape theatre-going practices in Scotland for the rest of the century.<ref name=Brown2007p231/>

The Ossian cycle itself became a common subject for Scottish artists, and works based on its themes were created by figures such as [[Alexander Runciman]] (1736<U+2013>85) and [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]] (1744<U+2013>96).<ref name=Chilvers2009p554>I.

K. Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain, 1530 to 1790'' (Yale University Press, fifth edn., 1994), ISBN 0300058330, p. 293.</ref>

The impact of Romanticism can also be seen in the works of late eighteenth and early nineteenth century artists such as [[Henry Raeburn]] (1756<U+2013>1823), [[Alexander Nasmyth]] (1758<U+2013>1840) and John Knox (1778<U+2013>1845). Raeburn was the most significant artist of the period to pursue his entire career in Scotland. He was born in Edinburgh and returned there after a trip to Italy in 1786. He is most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, going beyond the aristocracy to lawyers, doctors, professors, writers and ministers,<ref name=Campbell2003pp142-3/> adding elements of Romanticism to the tradition of Reynolds.<ref>C.

==Architecture==
{{Main|Scots Baronial}}
The Gothic revival in architecture has been seen as an expression of Romanticism, and according to Alvin Jackson, the Scots baronial style was "a Caledonian reading of the gothic".<ref>A. Jackson, ''The Two Unions: Ireland, Scotland, and the Survival of the United Kingdom, 1707<U+2013>2007'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), ISBN 019959399X, p. 152.</ref> Some of the earliest evidence of a revival in Gothic architecture are from Scotland. [[Inveraray Castle]], constructed from 1746 with design input from William Adam, incorporates [[turret]]s into a conventional [[Palladian architecture|Palladian-style]] house. His son Robert Adam's houses in this style include [[Mellerstain]] and [[Wedderburn Castle|Wedderburn]] in Berwickshire and Seton House in East Lothian. The trend is most clearly seen at [[Culzean Castle]], Ayrshire, remodelled by Robert from 1777.<ref>I. D. Whyte and K. A.

[[File:Abbotsford07.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abbotsford House]], re-built for [[Walter Scott]], helped to launch the [[Scots Baronial]] revival.]]
Important for the re-adoption of the Scots Baronial in the early nineteenth century was [[Abbotsford House]], the residence of Scott. Re-built for him from 1816, it became a model for the revival of the style. Common features borrowed from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century houses included [[battlements|battlemented]] gateways, [[crow-stepped gable]]s, pointed turrets and [[machicolations]]. The style was popular across Scotland and was applied to many relatively modest dwellings by architects such as [[William Burn]] (1789<U+2013>1870), [[David Bryce]] (1803<U+2013>1876),<ref name=Hull2006p154>L.

In ecclesiastical architecture, a style similar to that developed in England was adopted. Important figures in this movement included [[Frederick Thomas Pilkington]] (1832<U+2013>98), who developed a new style of church building which accorded with the fashionable [[Gothic Revival architecture|High Gothic]], but which adapted it for the worship needs of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]].

By 1880, his practice was designing some of the most prestigious public and private buildings in Scotland, such as the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]]; the Dome of Old College, Medical Faculty and McEwan Hall, [[Edinburgh University]]; the [[Central Hotel (Glasgow)|Central Hotel]] at [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central station]]; the [[Catholic Apostolic Church]] in Edinburgh; and [[Mount Stuart House]] on the Isle of Bute.<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p552>M.

He collected Scottish songs and obtained musical arrangements from the best European composers, who included [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. Burns was employed in editing the lyrics. ''A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs'' was published in five volumes between 1799 and 1818. It helped make Scottish songs part of the European cannon of classical music,<ref>D. A.

Perhaps the most influential composer of the first half of the nineteenth century was the German [[Felix Mendelssohn]], who visited Britain ten times, for a total of twenty months, from 1829. Scotland inspired two of his most famous works, the overture ''[[Hebrides Overture|Fingal's Cave]]'' (also known as the ''Hebrides Overture'') and the ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Mendelssohn)|Scottish Symphony]]'' (Symphony No. 3). On his last visit to England in 1847, he conducted his own ''Scottish Symphony'' with the Philharmonic Orchestra before Queen Victoria and [[Prince Albert]].<ref>D.

In contrast to Enlightenment histories, which have been seen as attempting to draw general lessons about humanity from history, the German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] in his ''Ideas upon Philosophy and the History of Mankind'' (1784), set out the concept of ''[[Volksgeist]]'', a unique national spirit that drove historical change. As a result, a key element in the impact of Romanticism on intellectual life was the production of national histories.<ref>G. J.

An important element in the emergence of a Scottish national history was an interest in antiquarianism, with figures like [[John Pinkerton]] (1758<U+2013>1826) collecting sources such as ballads, coins, medals, songs and artefacts.<ref name=Kidd2003p251/> Enlightenment historians had tended to react with embarrassment to Scottish history, particularly the feudalism of the Middle Ages and the religious intolerance of the Reformation.

[[File:Thomas Carlyle daguerreotype, 1848.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Thomas Carlyle]], a major figure in Romantic historical writing]]
Among the most significant intellectual figures associated with Romanticism was [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1795<U+2013>1881), born in Scotland and later a resident of London.

Romantic writers often reacted against the [[empiricism]] of Enlightenment historical writing, putting forward the figure of the "poet-historian" who would mediate between the sources of history and the reader, using insight to create more than chronicles of facts. For this reason, Romantic historians such as [[Jacques Nicolas Augustin Thierry|Thierry]] saw Walter Scott, who had spent considerable effort uncovering new documents and sources for his novels, as an authority in historical writing.<ref>S.

Romanticism has also been seen as having an impact on scientific enquiry. Romantic attitudes to science varied, from distrust of the scientific enterprise to endorsing a non-mechanical science that rejected the mathematicised and the abstract theorising associated with Newton. Major trends in continental science associated with Romanticism include ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'', developed by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]] (1775<U+2013>1854), which focused on the necessity of reuniting man with nature,<ref>M. Bossi and S. Poggi, eds., ''Romanticism in Science: Science in Europe, 1790<U+2013>1840'' (Springer, 2010), ISBN 9048142849, p. 31.</ref> and [[Humboldtian science]], based on the work of [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769<U+2013>1859). As defined by Susan Cannon, this form of inquiry placed a stress on observation, accurate scientific instruments and new conceptual tools; disregarded the boundaries between different disciplines; and emphasised working in nature rather than the artificial laboratory.<ref name=Helirbon2003p386>J. L. Heilbron, ''The Oxford Companion To the History of Modern Science'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), ISBN 0195112296, p. 386.</ref> Privileging observation above calculation, Romantic scientists were often attracted to the areas where investigation, rather than calculation and theory, was most important, particularly the life sciences, geology, optics and astronomy.<ref name=Burns2003pxviii>W.

James Allard identifies the origins of Scottish "Romantic medicine" in the work of Enlightenment figures, particularly the brothers [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William]] (1718<U+2013>83) and [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] (1728<U+2013>93), who were, respectively, the leading anatomist and surgeon of their day and in the role of Edinburgh as a major centre of medical teaching and research.<ref name=Allardpp379-80>J.

Brown argued in ''Elementa Medicinae'' (1780) that life is an essential "vital energy" or "excitability" and that disease is either the excessive or diminished redistribution of the normal intensity of the human organ, which became known as [[Brunonian system of medicine|Brunonianism]].

The University of Edinburgh was also a major supplier of surgeons for the royal navy, and [[Robert Jameson]] (1774<U+2013>1854), Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh, ensured that a large number of these were surgeon-naturalists, who were vital in the Humboldtian and imperial enterprise of investigating nature throughout the world.<ref name=Helirbon2003p386/><ref>J.

[[File:George IV in kilt, by Wilkie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]]'s flattering portrait of the [[kilt]]ed [[King George IV]]]]
In the aftermath of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] risings, a movement to restore [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] King [[James II of England]] to the throne, the British government enacted a series of laws that attempted to speed the process of the destruction of the clan system. Measures included a ban on the bearing of arms, the wearing of tartan and limitations on the activities of the Episcopalian Church. Most of the legislation was repealed by the end of the eighteenth century as the Jacobite threat subsided. 

Soon after, there was a process of the rehabilitation of highland culture. Tartan had already been adopted for highland regiments in the British army, which poor highlanders joined in large numbers until the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815, but by the nineteenth century it had largely been abandoned by the ordinary people of the region. In the 1820s, tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe.<ref>J. L.

==Philosophy==
{{Main|Scottish Common Sense Realism}}
The dominant school of philosophy in Scotland in the late eighteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth century is known as Common Sense Realism. It argued that there are certain concepts, such as our existence, the existence of solid objects and some basic moral "first principles", that are intrinsic to our make-up and from which all subsequent arguments and systems of morality must be derived. It can be seen as an attempt to reconcile the new scientific developments of the Enlightenment with religious belief.<ref name=Gutjhar2011p39>Paul C. Gutjahr, ''Charles Hodge: Guardian of American Orthodoxy'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), ISBN 0199740429), p. 39.</ref> The origins of these arguments are in a reaction to the [[scepticism]] that became dominant in the Enlightenment, particularly that articulated by Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]] (1711<U+2013>76). This branch of thinking was first formulated by [[Thomas Reid]] (1710<U+2013>96) in his ''An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense'' (1764).<ref>E. J. Wilson and P. H. Reill, ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' (Infobase Publishing, 2nd edn., 2004), ISBN 0816053359, pp. 499<U+2013>501.</ref> It was popularised in Scotland by figures including [[Dugald Stewart]] (1753<U+2013>1828) and in England by James Beattie. Stewart's students included Walter Scott, Walter Chambers and Thomas Brown,<ref name=Redekop2004>B. W. Redekop, "Reid's influence in Britain, Germany, France and America", in T. Cuneo and R. van Woudenberg, eds, ''The Cambridge Companion to Thomas Reid'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), ISBN 0521012082, pp. 313<U+2013>40.</ref> and this branch of thought would later be a major influence on Charles Darwin.<ref>C. Loring Brace, ''Evolution In An Anthropological View'' (Rowman & Littlefield, 2000), ISBN 0742502635, p. 51.</ref> [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]] (1788<U+2013>1856) attempted to combine Reid's approach with the philosophy of Kant.<ref>J. Skorupski, ''The Cambridge Companion to Mill'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), ISBN 0521422116, p. 143.</ref>

[[File:DugaldStewart.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Dugald Stewart]], a major figure in the popularisation of [[Scottish Common Sense Realism|Common Sense Realism]]]]
Common Sense Realism not only dominated Scottish thought but also had a major impact in France,<ref>A. Hook, "The French taste for Scottish Romantic literature", in D. Dawson and P. Mor<U+00E8>re, eds, ''Scotland and France in the Enlightenment'' (Bucknell University Press, 2004), ISBN 0838755267, p. 93.</ref> the United States, Germany and other countries. [[Victor Cousin]] (1792<U+2013>1867) was the most important proponent in France, becoming Minster of Education and incorporating the philosophy into the curriculum.<ref name=Redekop2004/> In Germany the emphasis on careful observation influenced Humboldt's ideas about science and was a major factor in the development of [[German Idealism]].<ref>M. Kuehn, ''Scottish Common Sense in Germany, 1768<U+2013>1800: A Contribution to the History of Critical Philosophy'' (McGill-Queens, 1987), ISBN 0773510095, pp. 144 and 166.</ref> [[James McCosh]] (1811<U+2013>94) brought Common Sense Realism directly from Scotland to North American in 1868 when he became president of [[Princeton University]], which soon became a stronghold of the movement. [[Noah Porter]] (1811<U+2013>92) taught Common Sense Realism to generations of students at [[University of Yale|Yale]].<ref name=Redekop2004/> As a result, it would be a major influence on the development of one of the most important offshoots of Romanticism in New England, [[Transcendentalism]], particularly in the writing of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803<U+2013>82).<ref name=Redekop2004/>

==Decline==
In literature, Romanticism is often thought to have ended in the 1830s,<ref>P. Poplawski, ''English Literature in Context'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008), ISBN 0521839920, p. 306.</ref><ref>J. P. Klancher, ''A Concise Companion to the Romantic Age'' (Oxford: John Wiley & Sons, 2009), ISBN 0631233555, p. 1.</ref> with a few commentators, like [[Margaret Drabble]], describing it as over by 1848.<ref name=Drabble>M. Drabble, ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, fifth edn., 1985), pp. 842<U+2013>3.</ref> Romanticism continued much longer in some places and areas of endeavour, particularly in music, where it has been dated from 1820 to 1910.<ref>M. Hinson, ''Anthology of Romantic Piano Music'' (Alfred Music Publishing, 2002), ISBN 0739024094, p. 4.</ref> The death of Scott in 1832 has been seen as marking the end of the great romantic generation,<ref>G. E. Paul Gillespie, ''Romantic Drama'' (John Benjamins, 1994), ISBN 1556196008, p. 32.</ref> and Scottish literature and culture in general lost some of its international prominence from this point. Scott's reputation as a writer also went into decline in the late nineteenth century, only recovering in the twentieth.<ref>I. Duncan, "Walter Scott" in D. S. Kastan, ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature, Volume 1'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), ISBN 0195169212, p. 462.</ref> Economic and social change, particularly the better communications brought by the railways, decreased the ability of Edinburgh to function as an alternative cultural capital to London, with its publishing industry moving to London.<ref>I. Duncan, ''Scott's Shadow: The Novel in Romantic Edinburgh'' (Princeton University Press, 2007), ISBN 0691043833, p. 306.</ref> Lack of opportunities in politics and letters led many talented Scots to leave for England and elsewhere. The sentimental [[Kailyard]] tradition of [[J. M. Barrie]] and [[George MacDonald]], of those that continued to pursue Scottish topics at the end of the nineteenth century, was seen by [[Tom Nairn]] as  "sub-romantic".<ref>A. Blaikie, ''The Scots Imagination and Modern Memory'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), ISBN 0748617868, pp. 111<U+2013>12.</ref> 

[[File:McTaggart, The Storm.jpg|thumb|right|[[William McTaggart]]'s ''The Storm'', 1890, incorporating elements of Impressionism into the Scottish landscape tradition]]
In art, the tradition of Scottish landscape painting continued into the later nineteenth century, but Romanticism gave way to influences including French [[Impressionism]], [[Post-Impressionism]] and eventually [[Modernism]].<ref>F. Fowle, "Patterns of taste: Scottish collectors and the making of cultural identity in the late nineteenth century", in F. Cullen, J. Morrison, eds, ''A Shared Legacy: Essays On Irish And Scottish Art And Visual Culture British Art and Visual Culture Since 1750, New Readings'' (Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2005), ISBN 0754606449, pp. 181<U+2013>2.</ref> The Scots baronial style continued to be popular until the end of the nineteenth century, when other styles began to dominate.<ref>J. Gifford, ''Perth and Kinross'' (Yale University Press, 2007), ISBN 0300109229, p. 83.</ref> Although Romanticism persisted in music much longer than in almost every area, it fell out of fashion in the twentieth century and anti-Romantic currents in Britain virtually buried Victorian and Edwardian music not written by [[Edward Elgar]] or [[Arthur Sullivan]].<ref name=Stevenson/> The idea of the historical imagination was replaced with the source-based empiricism championed by Ranke.<ref>T. S. Martin, ''Green History: The Future of the Past'' (University Press of America, 2000), ISBN 0761816100, p. 85.</ref> Marinel Ash has noted that after the death of Scott, Scottish national history lost its momentum, and the Scottish literati stopped writing Scottish histories. [[Colin Kidd]] has observed a change of attitudes to historical writing and suggests that this was one reason for a lack of the development of political nationalism.<ref name=Ichijo2004pp3-4/> In science, the rapid expansion of knowledge increased a tendency towards specialisation and professionalism and a decline of the polymath "man of letters" and amateurs that had dominated Romantic science.<ref>A. Walton Litz, ''Modernism and the New Criticism'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), ISBN 0521300126, p. 378.</ref> Common Sense Realism began to decline in Britain in the face of the English [[empiricism]] outlined by [[John Stuart Mill]] in his ''An Examination of Sir William Hamilton's Philosophy'' (1865).<ref>Walter A. Elwell, ed., ''Evangelical Dictionary of Theology'' (Baker Academic, 2nd edn., 2001), ISBN 0801020751, p. 1079.</ref>

==Influence==
[[File:Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy 1848.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The young [[Leo Tolstoy]], one of the many writers directly influenced by Scottish Romanticism]]
Scotland can make a claim to have begun the Romantic movement with writers like Macpherson and Burns.<ref>G. Carruthers and A. Rawesin "Introduction: romancing the Celt", in G. Carruthers and A. Rawes, eds, ''English Romanticism and the Celtic World'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), ISBN 052181085X, p. 6.</ref> In Scott it produced a figure of international fame and influence, whose virtual invention of the historical novel would be picked up by writers across the world, including [[Alexandre Dumas]] and [[Honor<U+00E9> de Balzac]] in France, [[Leo Tolstoy]] in Russia and [[Alessandro Manzoni]] in Italy.<ref>P. Melville Logan, O. George, S. Hegeman and E. Kristal, ''The Encyclopedia of the Novel, Volume 1'' (Oxford: John Wiley & Sons, 2011), ISBN 1405161841, p. 384.</ref> The tradition of Scottish landscape painting had a major impact on art in Britain and elsewhere through figures like [[J. M. W. Turner]], who took part in the emerging Scottish "grand tour".<ref name=Szasz200p136>F. M. Szasz, ''Scots in the North American West, 1790<U+2013>1917'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 2000), ISBN 0806132531, p. 136.</ref> The Scottish baronial style influenced buildings in England and was taken by Scots to North America,<ref>B.

Apel, ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (Harvard University Press, 2nd edn., 1969), ISBN 0674375017, p. 760.</ref> 

The idea of history as a force and the romantic concept of revolution were highly influential on transcendentalists like Emerson, and through them on American literature in general.<ref name=Aneskoetal2006pp7-9/> Romantic science maintained the prominence and reputation that Scotland had begun to obtain in the Enlightenment and helped in the development of many emerging fields of investigation, including geology and biology. According to Robert D. Purington, "to some the nineteenth century seems to be the century of Scottish science".<ref>Robert D. Purrington, ''Physics in the Nineteenth Century'' (Rutgers University Press, 1997), ISBN 0813524423, p. 14.</ref> Politically the initial function of Romanticism as pursued by Scott and others helped to diffuse some of the tension created by Scotland's place in the Union, but it also helped to ensure the survival of a common and distinct Scottish national identity that would play a major part in Scottish life and emerge as a significant factor in Scottish politics from the second half of the twentieth century.<ref>N. Davidson, ''The Origins of Scottish Nationhood'' (Pluto Press, 2000), ISBN 0745316085, pp. 162<U+2013>3 and 200-1.</ref> Externally, modern images of Scotland worldwide, its landscape, culture, sciences and arts, are still largely defined by those created and popularised by Romanticism.<ref>G.
