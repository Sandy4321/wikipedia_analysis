On January 21, 1968, a [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] '''[[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]]''' carrying four [[hydrogen bomb]]s '''crashed into the frozen ocean''' in [[North Star Bay]], [[Greenland]] '''near [[Thule Air Base]]'''. An escalating cabin fire had forced the crew to eject from the aircraft. The nuclear payload ruptured and was dispersed during the subsequent explosion and fire atop the ice, resulting in widespread [[radioactive contamination]]. Controversially, the components of only three of the four bombs could be accounted for after the cleanup operation had been completed.

On [[January 21]], [[1968]], a [[United States Air Force]] [[B-52 Stratofortress#B-52G|B-52G Stratofortress]] from the 380th Strategic Bomb Wing at [[Plattsburgh Air Force Base]], New York had been conducting a routine "Chrome Dome" airborne alert flight over [[Baffin Bay]]<ref name="StatusReport">{{cite web|url=http://www.thulesagen.dk/thuledoc/0075943.pdf|title=B-52 Crash at Thule Air Base|date=1968-01-22|accessdate=2008-11-13|publisher=[[United States Atomic Energy Commission]]}}</ref>.  The purpose of the Chrome Dome missions was to fly a nuclear-armed B-52 above Greenland at all times, so that [[Strategic Air Command]] would still have communications and defensive capability in the event of the [[Ballistic Missile Early Warning System]] at [[Thule Air Base]] being knocked out by a Soviet [[first strike]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MYzNtetBpFwC|title=Worst Cases|author=Lee Ben Clarke|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2006|isbn=0226108597|accessdate=2008-11-16}}</ref>

The B-52 was about six hours into its mission and orbiting at high altitude about {{convert|42|mi|km}} from Thule Air Base when a fire broke out in the navigator's compartment.<ref name="StatusReport"/> Normal crew complement was six, but this mission carried a seventh officer, possibly for navigation training purposes.  Co-pilot Leonard Svitenko had gone for a rest before the fire, giving up his seat to the seventh man, D'Mario.  The pilot, Haug, tried to divert to the nearest air field, Thule Air Base, nearly 10 minutes away. Within five minutes the crew realized the fire, in the aft section of the lower deck, was out of control when electrical power was lost and smoke filled the cockpit to the point that instruments could no longer be read.<ref name="InterimReport">{{cite report|url=http://www.thulesagen.dk/thuledoc/0106883.pdf|title=AEC Observers' Interim Report of Thule Accident|date=1968-02-26|accessdate=2008-11-13|publisher=[[United States Atomic Energy Commission]]}}</ref><ref name="ForeignRelations">{{cite web|title=Foreign Relations of the United States 1964-1968, Volume XII, Western Europe: Denmark |url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/frus/johnsonlb/xii/2199.htm |publisher=[[United States Department of State]]|accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref> As the situation worsened, the pilot declared an emergency and the crew prepared to abandon the aircraft, awaiting the word for when they were over land. Once D'Mario confirmed they were directly over the lights of Thule Air Base, the four crewmen ejected, followed shortly thereafter by Haug and D'Mario.  The pilotless aircraft initially continued northwards before turning 180&nbsp;degress to the left and crashing into sea ice in [[North Star Bay]], about {{convert|7.5|mi|km}} West of Thule Air Base.  The conventional high explosive components of four [[B28 nuclear bomb|B28FI model hydrogen bombs]] detonated on impact, spreading [[radioactive contamination|radioactive material]] over a large area, although a nuclear explosion was not triggered.  The extreme heat generated as 225,000 pounds of unused aviation fuel burned for the next 5 to 6 hours melted the ice sheet, causing some wreckage and munitions to sink to the [[ocean floor]].  Of the six who ejected safely, one remained lost on the ice for nearly 24 hours and suffered hypothermia as a consequence.  Svitenko, probably trapped by the fire, did not survive.  An aerial survey of the crash site immediately afterwards showed only six engines, a tire and some small debris on the surface of the ice.<ref name="StatusReport"/>

The Danes and Americans immediately launched a huge joint clean up operation named "Project Crested Ice" (informally known as "Dr Freezelove"<ref name="ColdWar">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JSyv24u7iVEC|title=The Cold War|author=Jussi M.

Components that were not immediately destroyed in the explosion and fire were widely scattered in a {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} by {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}} area.<ref name="ProjectCrestedIce">{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA283578&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf|publisher=[[United States Navy]]|title=Project Crested Ice|author=Captain Robert E McElwee|accessdate=2008-11-14}}</ref> Parts of the bomb bay were found {{convert|2|mi|km}} north of the impact area, indicating that the aircraft had started to break up before impact.<ref name="BrokenArrow">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gi7HARO8vTcC |pages=232 |title=Broken Arrow - The Declassified History of U.S. Nuclear Weapons Accidents |author=James C.

Crites|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|date=2003-03-26|accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref>  The radioactive contaminants from the bombs were [[plutonium]], [[uranium]] and [[americium]].  Contaminated material that initially floated on the water under the ice was frozen into it as the ice sheet expanded through the winter.  

A base camp, named "Camp Hunziker"<ref name="ProjectCrestedIce"/>, was immediately created at the crash site, which included a heliport, igloos, generators and communications facilities. A "zero line" was established by 25 January, delineating the contaminated area, and was subsequently used to control decontamination of personnel and vehicles.  Two ice roads to Thule were constructed.  Later the camp would include a large prefabricated building, two ski-mounted buildings, several huts, a decontamination trailer and a latrine.  The onsite facilities allowed for 24-hour operations at the crash site.<ref name="BrokenArrow"/>

Weather conditions at the site were extreme, with an average temperature of {{convert|-40|F|C}}, at times dropping to {{convert|-80|F|C}}, and accompanied by winds of up to {{convert|85|mph|km/h}}.  Battery-operated instruments worked for limited periods of time in the cold, requiring their operators to modify them so that they could carry the battery packs under their coats to extend their usage.<ref name="ProjectCrestedIce"/>  There was no light at all until 24 January when twilight started; on 10 February, the sun appeared briefly for the first time.<ref name="BrokenArrow"/>  

Various cleanup options were considered, before it was decided to remove the contaminated ice and wreckage to the United States for disposal.<ref name="IceInvestigations"/> Debris from the weapons was sent to the [[Pantex]] plant for evaluation<ref name="InterimReport"/>; the contaminated ice was collected and shipped to South Carolina in large steel tanks.

[[Image:Mk 28 F1 Thermonuclear Bomb.jpg|thumb|left|B28FI Thermonuclear bomb]]
The Pentagon stated at the time that all four bombs were destroyed. However, declassified documents obtained in 2008 under the US [[Freedom of Information Act]] (parts of which remain classified) reveal that, within weeks of the incident, investigators piecing together the fragments realized that only three of the weapons could be accounted for.<ref name="Mystery">{{cite news |first=Gordon |last=Corera |title=Mystery of lost US nuclear bomb |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7720049.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2008-11-10 |accessdate=2008-11-10}}</ref>  Even by the end of January 1968, one of the declassified documents talks of a blackened section of ice which had refrozen with shroud lines from a weapon parachute.  "Speculate something melted through the ice such as burning [[Python primary|primary]] or secondary,"<ref name="Mystery"/> (the primary or secondary referring to [[Teller-Ulam design|parts of the weapon]]).  

[[Image:Submersible named Star III in front of Scripps Institution of Oceanography.JPG|thumb|right|Star III submersible]]
By April, a decision had been taken to send a Star III mini-submarine to the base to look for the lost bomb, which had the serial number 78252.<ref>{{cite web|date=1968-03-18|accessdate=2008-11-15|url=http://www.thulesagen.dk/thuledoc/0106985.pdf|title=B-52 Crash at Thule Air Base|publisher=[[United States Atomic Energy Commission]]}}</ref>  (A similar submarine search off the coast of Spain two years earlier had led to another weapon being recovered following a [[Palomares hydrogen bombs incident|B-52 crash off Palomares]], Spain on January 17, 1966.)  The real purpose of the underwater search at Thule was deliberately hidden from Danish officials.  One document from July 1968 reads: "Fact that this operation includes search for object or missing weapon part is to be treated as Confidential [[Classified information|NOFORN]]",<ref name="Mystery"/> meaning not to be disclosed to any foreign country. "For discussion with Danes, this operation should be referred to as a survey, repeat survey of bottom under impact point,"<ref name="Mystery"/> it continued.  Further indications of an ongoing underwater search for a missing bomb are apparent in an interim report by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] in September 1968, which stated "It was further speculated that the missing ''<deleted>'', in view of its ballistic characteristics, may have come to rest beyond the observed concentration of heavy debris."<ref name="StatusReport10"/> 

The underwater search was beset by technical problems and eventually abandoned.  Diagrams and notes included in the declassified documents make clear it was not possible to search the entire area where debris from the crash had spread.  Components of recovered weapons show four bomb reservoirs, one complete [[Teller-Ulam design|secondary]], and parts equalling two secondaries were recovered on the sea ice (parts equalling one secondary were not accounted for).<ref>{{cite journal|journal=USAF Nuclear Safety|volume=Vol. 60, Part 1|date=Jul-Aug 1968}}</ref> Additionally, the underwater search had revealed a weapon cable fairing, polar cap, and a one by three foot section of the warhead ballistic case.<ref name="StatusReport10">{{cite report|title=Thule Status Report|date=1968-09-10|url=http://www.thulesagen.dk/thuledoc/0107059.pdf|publisher=[[United States Atomic Energy Commission]]|accessdate=2008-11-18}}</ref>. 

The BBC tracked down a number of officials who were involved in dealing with the aftermath of the incident.  One was William H. Chambers, a former nuclear weapons designer at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory]], who once ran a team dealing with accidents, including the Thule crash.  He explained the logic behind the decision to abandon the search as follows<ref name="Mystery"/>:  {{cquote|There was disappointment in what you might call a failure to return all of the components...it would be very difficult for anyone else to recover classified pieces if we couldn<U+2019>t find them.}}

By the time the operation concluded, a team of 700 specialised personnel from both countries, including over 70 US government agencies, had worked for nine months to clean up the site,<ref name="ColdWar"/><ref name="OnThisDay">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/28/newsid_2506000/2506207.stm|title=1968: Radiation alert following B-52 crash|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> often without adequate protective clothing or decontamination measures.  In total, more than 550,000 US gallons (2,082 kilolitres) of contaminated liquid, as well as thirty tanks of miscellaneous material, some of it contaminated, was collected in a holding area known as the Tank Farm.<ref name="StatusReport10"/>  Operation Crested Ice ended on [[13 September]] [[1968]] when the last tank was loaded onto a ship bound for the United States.<ref name="Eriksson"/>

==Aftermath==
[[Image:ThuleRadiationCheck.jpg|thumb|right|A monitor checks a pump operator for radiation contamination during Operation Crested Ice]]
The incident was the subject of much controversy at the time and in the following 40 years. Danish authorities had discovered in 1965 that the Americans were storing nuclear weapons at Thule against their wishes.  The accident was therefore seen as a breach of [[Denmark|Denmark's]] [[nuclear free zone]] policy and caused some diplomatic friction, especially as it happened the day before [[Danish parliamentary election, 1968|parliamentary elections in Denmark]].<ref name="LimitsOfSafety">{{cite book|title=The Limits of Safety|author=Scott Douglas Sagan|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4pV_wbOnphsC|isbn=0691021015|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995|accessdate=2008-11-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://cndyorks.gn.apc.org/yspace/articles/greenland3.htm|title=Greenlanders Wary of a New Role in U.S. Defenses|author=James Brooke|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2000-09-18|accessdate=2008-11-11}}</ref>  The accident also signalled the end of the "Chrome Dome" airborne alert system, which had become untenable from political and economic points of view.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U0zIt5KPEbQC|title=B-52 Stratofortress Units in Combat 1955-73|author=Jon Lake, Mark Styling|isbn=1841766070|year=2004|publisher=Osprey Publishing|accessdate=2008-11-14}}</ref> Years later in 2000, reports started to surface in the Danish press that, contrary to earlier assurances to Denmark, one of the bombs had not been recovered.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/878907.stm|title=Nuclear bomb 'lost near Greenland'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2000-08-13|accessdate-2008-11-14|author=Jon Leyne|accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref>  In 2008, the BBC obtained recently declassified documents under the [[freedom of information legislation|freedom of information act]] confirming that the fourth weapon had not been found.<ref name="Mystery"/>

The clean-up efforts resulted in law suits filed by relief workers in later years, many of whom were affected by the radiation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7720466.stm|title=Radioactive legacy of 'lost bomb'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2008-11-10|accessdate=2008-11-15|author=Gordon Corera}}</ref>  Unlike their military counterparts, the Danish civilians involved in the clean up operation claim that their health was not monitored in subsequent years for signs of [[radiation sickness]], prompting the Thule workers' association in 2007 to threaten to take their government to the [[European Court of Justice]].<ref name="ECJ">{{cite news|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6647421.stm|title=Denmark challenged over B52 crash|date=2007-05-11|accessdate=2008-11-18|author= Stephen Mulvey}}</ref>

Radiation site monitoring has been carried out periodically, particularly in the marine environment, which the local [[Inuit]]s rely upon as a food source.  A 1997 international expedition (mainly Danish and Finnish scientists) carried out a comprehensive sediment sampling program in the Bylot Sound.<ref name="Eriksson"/>  The main conclusions of that expedition, were; that plutonium is not transported from the contaminated sediments into the surface water in this shelf sea, the debris has been efficiently buried in the sediment to great depth as a result of biological activity and transfer of plutonium to [[benthic zone|benthic]] biota is low.  The fission material in the weapons involved in the accident mostly consisted of [[Uranium 235]] (about 4 times more in mass than [[Plutonium 239]]). The expedition concluded that there are at least two different source terms for the Thule accident debris. Furthermore, research indicates that uranium is leaching from the particles faster than plutonium and americium.<ref name="Eriksson">{{cite paper|author=Mats Eriksson|title=PhD thesis|publisher=[[Lund University]]|date=April 2002|location=Ris<U+00F8> National Laboratory, Roskilde, Denmark|accessdate=2008-11-15|url=http://www.risoe.dk/rispubl/NUK/nukpdf/ris-r-1321.pdf}}</ref>
