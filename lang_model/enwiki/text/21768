<onlyinclude>[[Image:Congas.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Conga]] drums are a common part of Caribbean music across much of the area]]
This is a '''list of [[drum]]s''' used in the [[Caribbean music]] [[music area|area]], including the islands of the [[Caribbean Sea]], as well as the musics of [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[French Guiana]], [[Bahamas]], and [[Bermuda]]. It only includes drums that are indigenous to the local music area or are a vital and long-standing part of local culture. It does not include drums that are, for example, a part of Western style orchestras, nor does it include [[trap set]]s and other common drums used in popular music recordings of many genres across the world. Drums can be classified and described using a number of criteria, including the production of sound and the shape of the instrument. The presence of a cloth, fabric or skin head, the number of heads, and the constituent materials are also used to distinguish between different kinds of drums. Similar drums within a culture may be divided based on their manner of use, performance methods and rhythms, intended context, audience or performer, or details of the instruments' manufacture, such as its precise size or the technique used to lace the head onto the body of the drum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cnx.org/content/m11896/latest/|work=Connexions|author=Catherine Schmidt-Jones|title=Classifying Musical Instruments: Membranophones|accessdate=January 22|accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/LinguaLinks/Anthropology/ExpnddEthnmsclgyCtgrCltrlMtrls/mMembranophones.htm|title=534m Membranophones|work=SIL|accessdate=January 4|accessyear=2007}}</ref>
