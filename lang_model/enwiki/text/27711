'''Aaron Burr, Jr.''' ([[6 February]] [[1756]] &ndash; [[14 September]] [[1836]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[politician]], [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] hero and [[adventurer]]. He served as the third [[Vice President of the United States]] under [[Thomas Jefferson]] (1801&ndash;1805).

A formative member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]] with a political base in [[New York]], Burr served in the [[New York State Assembly]] (1784&ndash;1785, 1798&ndash;1801), as [[New York State Attorney General]] (1789&ndash;1791), [[United States Senator]] (1791-1797), and for one term as Vice President of the United States (1801&ndash;1805) under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Thomas Jefferson]].  A [[U.S. presidential election, 1800|candidate for President in 1800]], Burr tied Jefferson with 73 electoral votes, making him eligible for one of the Nation's two highest offices and sending the election into the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].  After 36 ballots, Jefferson was elected President and Burr elected Vice President. As Vice President, Burr was [[President of the Senate]], and in such role, presided over the [[Impeachment|impeachment trial]] of [[Samuel Chase]].

During an unsuccessful campaign for election to [[Governor of New York]] in 1804, Burr was often referred to in published articles written by [[Alexander Hamilton]] (1755-1804), a long-time political rival and son-in-law of [[Philip Schuyler]], the first U.S. Senator from New York who Burr defeated in his bid for re-election in 1791. Taking umbrage at remarks made by Hamilton at a dinner party and Hamilton's subsequent failure to account for the remarks, [[Burr-Hamilton duel|Burr challenged Hamilton]] to a [[duel]] on [[11 July]] [[1804]], at the [[Weehawken, New Jersey|Heights of Weehawken]] in [[New Jersey]] at which he mortally wounded Hamilton. Arguably the most famous [[Duelling|duel]] in U.S. history, it had immense political ramifications. Burr, who survived the duel, was indicted for murder in both New York and New Jersey (though these charges were either later dismissed or resulted in acquittal), and the harsh criticism and animosity directed towards him brought about an end to his political career in the East, though he remained a popular figure in the West and South. Further, Hamilton's untimely death would fatally weaken the fledging remnants of the [[Federalist Party]], which, combined with the death of [[George Washington]] (1732-1799) five years earlier, was left without a strong leader.

After Burr left the Vice Presidency at the end of his term in 1805, he journeyed into what was then the U.S. West, particularly the [[Ohio River|Ohio River Valley]] area and the lands acquired in the [[Louisiana Purchase]].  While historians are uncertain as to Burr's particular activities, he was accused in turns of having committed [[treason]], of a conspiracy to steal Louisiana Purchase lands away from the United States and crown himself a King or Emperor, or of an attempt to declare an illegal war against [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish possessions]] in [[Mexico]]).  He did go so far as to form his own regiment or at least 200 men.  Burr was arrested in 1807 and brought to trial on charges of treason, for which he was acquitted.  After several years in self-imposed [[exile]] in Europe, Burr returned to practicing law in [[New York City]] and lived a largely reclusive existence until his death.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Burr was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]], to the Rev. [[Aaron Burr, Sr.]], who was a presbyterian minister and the second president of the [[College of New Jersey]], now [[Princeton University]]; his mother, [[Ester Edwards]], was the daughter of [[Jonathan Edwards (theology)|Jonathan Edwards]], the famous [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[theology|theologian]]. The Edwards also had a daughter, Sarah, who married an officer in Washington's Revolutionary Army, Sir Solomon Tarbox.  Aaron and his sister are of near if not exclusive [[English people|English]] ancestry <ref>[http://wc.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=PED&db=:792533&id=I84256338 wc.rootsweb.com]</ref>.

In 1772, he received his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] in theology at [[Princeton University]], but changed his career path two years later and began the study of law in the celebrated law school conducted by [[Tapping Reeve]], at [[Litchfield, Connecticut]]. His studies were put on hold while he served during the Revolutionary War, under Gens. [[Benedict Arnold]], George Washington (for two weeks), and [[Israel Putnam]].

===Military service===
During the Revolutionary War, Aaron Burr took part in General Benedict Arnold's [[invasion of Canada (1775)|expedition into Canada]] in 1775, an arduous trek of over 500 miles in winter. Upon arriving before the [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|Battle of Quebec]], Burr was sent up the St. Lawrence River to make contact with General [[Richard Montgomery]], who had taken Montreal, and escorted him to Quebec. Montgomery promoted Burr to captain and made him an [[aide-de-camp]]. Although Montgomery was killed while attempting to capture the city of Quebec during a fierce snow storm on 31 December 1775, Burr distinguished himself with brave actions against the British.

His courage made him a national hero and earned him a place on Washington's staff in [[Manhattan]], but he quit after two weeks because he wanted to return to the field. Never hesitant to voice his opinions, Burr may have set Washington against him. Washington referred to him as "a man of no talents... one who could not spell a sentence of common English"<ref>Melton, p. 29</ref> (however, rumors that Washington then distrusted Burr have never been substantiated). General Israel Putnam took Burr under his wing, and by his vigilance in the retreat from lower Manhattan to Harlem, Burr saved an entire [[brigade]] from capture. 

Alexander Hamilton was an officer of this group. In a stark departure from common practice, Washington failed to commend Burr's actions in the next day's General Orders (the fastest way to obtain a promotion in rank). Although Burr was already a nationally-known hero, he never received a commendation. According to Burr's stepbrother [[Matthew Ogden]], Burr was infuriated by the incident, which may have led to the eventual estrangement between him and Washington. (Source: "Burr," Lomask, '82 and Shachner, "Aaron Burr," '37).

On becoming [[lieutenant colonel]] in July 1777, Burr assumed virtual leadership of [[Malcolm's Additional Continental Regiment]] under Colonel William Malcolm.  Some 300 strong, their devotion to Burr was resolute.  They successfully fought off continual nighttime raids into central New Jersey by English troops sailing over from Manhattan, crushing those forces for good. During the harsh winter encampment at [[Valley Forge]], he was put in charge of a small contingent guarding the "Gulph," an isolated pass commanding the approach to the camp, and necessarily the first point that would be attacked. Burr was chosen to enforce discipline there, successfully defeating a mutiny by some of the troops.

On [[June 28]], [[1778]] at the [[Battle of Monmouth]], his regiment was decimated by British artillery, and Burr suffered a [[heat stroke|stroke]] in the terrible heat from which he would never quite recover. In January 1779, Burr was assigned to the command of the lines of [[Westchester County]], a region between the British post at [[Kingsbridge, Bronx, New York|Kingsbridge]] and that of the U.S. about {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} to the north. In this district there was much turbulence and plundering by the lawless elements of both [[Whig (American Revolution)|Whigs]] and [[Tories]], and by bands of ill-disciplined soldiers from both armies. Burr established a thorough patrol system, rigorously enforced [[martial law]], and quickly restored order. 

He resigned from the [[Continental Army]] in March 1779 on account of ill health, renewing his study of [[law]]. He was assigned by General Washington to perform occasional intelligence missions for Continental generals such as [[Arthur St. Clair]] and on [[July 5]], [[1779]] he rallied a group of [[Yale University|Yale]] students at [[New Haven]] along with Capt. [[James Hillhouse]] and the [[Second Connecticut Governors Foot Guard]] in a skirmish with the British at the West River. The British advance was repulsed, having to enter New Haven from [[Hamden, Connecticut|Hamden]]. 

Despite this brief interlude, Burr was able to finish his studies and was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]] at [[Albany, New York|Albany]] in 1782. He began to practice in New York City after its evacuation by the British in the following year.  He lived in Richmond Hill, an area just outside of Greenwich Village.

===Marriage===
That same year, Burr married [[Theodosia Bartow Prevost]], the widow of James Marcus Prevost (see [[The Hermitage (New Jersey)|The Hermitage]]), a British army officer who had died in the [[West Indies]] during the Revolutionary War. They moved to New York City, where Burr's reputation as a brilliant trial lawyer was well-known. They had two daughters who survived birth, only one of whom grew to adulthood, and was named after her mother. The marriage lasted until the elder Theodosia's death from stomach cancer twelve years later. Born in 1783, his daughter [[Theodosia Burr Alston|Theodosia]], became widely known for her education and accomplishments. She married [[Joseph Alston]] of [[South Carolina]] in 1801, and bore a son who died of fever at ten years of age. She died either due to [[piracy]] or in a [[shipwreck]] off the [[Carolinas]] in the winter of 1812 or early 1813. 

In 1833, at age 77, Burr married again, this time to [[Eliza Bowen Jumel]], the extremely wealthy widow of [[Stephen Jumel]]. When she realized her fortune was dwindling from her husband's [[land speculation]], they separated after only four months.

===Legal and early political career===
Burr served in the New York State Assembly from 1784 to 1785, but became seriously involved in politics in 1789, when [[George Clinton (politician)|George Clinton]] appointed him New York State Attorney General. He was commissioner of Revolutionary War claims in 1791, and that same year was elected to the [[United States Senate]] over the incubent, General Philip Schuyler, and served there until 1797. 

While Burr and Jefferson served during the Washington administration, the Federal Government was resident in [[Philadelphia]]. They both roomed for a time at the boarding house of a Mrs. Payne. Her daughter [[Dolley Madison|Dolley]], an attractive young widow, was introduced by Burr to [[James Madison]], whom she subsequently married. 

Although Hamilton and Burr had long been on good personal terms, often dining with one another, Burr's defeat of General Schuyler, Hamilton's father-in-law probably drove the first major wedge into their friendship. Nevertheless, their relationship took a decade to reach a status of enmity.     

As a U.S. Senator, Burr was not a favorite in President George Washington's eyes. He sought to write an official Revolutionary history, but Washington blocked his access to the [[National Archives|archives]], possibly because the former colonel had been a noted critic of his leadership, and possibly because he regarded Burr as a schemer. Washington also passed over Burr for the ministry to [[France]]. After being appointed commanding general of U.S. forces by President [[John Adams]] in 1798, Washington turned down Burr's application for a [[brigadier general]]'s commission during the [[Quasi-War]] with France. Adams wrote, "By all that I have known and heard, Colonel Burr is a brave and able officer, but the question is whether he has not equal talents at intrigue."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=MZQ8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA124&dq=by+all+that+i+have+known+and+heard+colonel+burr+is+a+brave+and+able+officer+but+the+question+is+whether+he+has+not+equal+talents+at+intrigue&ei=J3QNR7C9KJyS7QLX89CuBg|title= The Works of John Adams, Second President of the United States: With a Life ...|accessdate= 2007-10-11}}</ref>  Hamilton, who by then despised Burr, still had Washington's ear at this time. Earlier, Burr had told Hamilton that "he despised Washington as a man of no talents and one who could not spell a sentence of common English."  However, Washington's wartime strategies may have colored Burr's opinion of the General. (Sources:  Schachner; Lomask.)

</blockquote>
Bored with the inactivity of the new U.S. Senate, Burr ran for and was elected to the [[New York state legislature]], serving from 1798 through 1801. During John Adams's term as President, [[political parties|national parties]] became clearly defined. Burr loosely associated himself with the Democratic-Republicans, though he had moderate [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist]] allies, such as Sen. [[Jonathan Dayton]] of New Jersey. Burr quickly became a key player in New York politics, more powerful in time than Hamilton, largely because of the [[Tammany Society]], later to become the infamous [[Tammany Hall]], which Burr converted from a social club into a [[political machine]] to help Jefferson reach the Presidency. In 1799, Burr founded the Bank of the Manhattan Company, which in later years evolved into the [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] and later [[JPMorgan Chase]]. Of the 16 states' electoral votes, only seven states were for the Jeffersonians, but Federalist New York had an electoral vote coming up before the election.  Burr fielded a slate for Jefferson (Hamilton fielded the other for the Federalists) and won.  This led to ultimate victory for Jefferson and drove another wedge between Hamilton and Burr.  Burr became Vice President.  

During the [[French Revolution]], French diplomat [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand]], in need of sanctuary to escape the Terror, stayed in Burr's home in New York City but also spent much time at Hamilton's house. When Burr, after the Hamilton duel and treason trial, traveled Europe in an attempt to recoup his fortunes, [[Talleyrand]] refused him entrance into France. Talleyrand was an ardent admirer of Alexander Hamilton and had even once written: "I consider Napoleon, Fox, and Hamilton, the three greatest men of our epoch, and if I were forced to decide between the three, I would give without hesitation the first place to Hamilton. He had divined Europe."

===Vice Presidency===
Because of his influence in New York city and the New York legislature, Burr was asked by Jefferson and Madison to help the Jeffersonians in the election of 1800. Burr sponsored a bill through the New York Assembly that established a water utility company that also allowed the Democratic-Republicans to create a bank for Jefferson's campaign. Another crucial move was Burr's success in getting his slate of New York City and nearby Electors to win election, thus defeating the Federalist slate, which was chosen and backed by Alexander Hamilton, who lost. This event drove a further wedge between the former friends.

Burr is known as the father of modern political campaigning.  He enlisted the help of members of Tammany Hall, a social club, and won the election. He was then placed on the Democratic-Republican presidential ticket in the 1800 election with Jefferson. At the time, [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] chose the members of the [[U.S. Electoral College]], and New York was crucial to Jefferson. Though Jefferson did win New York, he and Burr tied for the presidency with 73 electoral votes each.

It was well understood that the party intended that Jefferson should be president and Burr vice president, but the responsibility for the final choice belonged to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The attempts of a powerful faction among the Federalists to secure the election of Burr failed, partly due to opposition by Alexander Hamilton and partly due to Burr himself, who did little to obtain votes in his own favor. He wrote to Jefferson underscoring his promise to be vice president, and again during the voting stalemate in the Congress wrote again that he would give it up entirely if Jefferson so demanded. Ultimately, the election devolved to the point where it took 36 [[ballot]]s before [[James A. Bayard]], a [[Delaware]] Federalist, submitted a blank vote. Federalist abstentions in the [[Vermont]] and [[Maryland]] delegations led to Jefferson's election as President, and Burr<U+2019>s moderate Federalist supporters conceded his defeat.

Upon confirmation of Jefferson<U+2019>s election, Burr became Vice President of the United States, but despite his letters and his shunning of any political activity during the balloting (he never left Albany) he lost Jefferson's trust after that, and was effectively shut out of party matters. Some historians conjecture that the reason for this was Burr's casual regard for politics, and that he didn't act aggressively enough during the election tie. Jefferson was tight-lipped in private about Burr, so his reasons are still not entirely clear. However, Burr's even-handed fairness and his judicial manner as President of the Senate were praised even by his bitterest enemies, and he fostered some time-honored traditions in regard to that office. Historian Forrest MacDonald has credited Burr's judicial manner in presiding over the impeachment trial of Justice Samuel Chase with helping to preserve the principle of judicial independence that was established by [[Marbury v. Madison]] in 1803.

===Duel with Alexander Hamilton===
[[Image:Hamilton-burr-duel.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Alexander Hamilton]] fights his fatal duel with Vice President Aaron Burr.]]
{{main|Burr-Hamilton duel}}

When it became clear that Jefferson would drop Burr from his ticket in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1804|1804 election]], the Vice President ran for the governorship of New York instead. Burr lost the election, and blamed his loss on a personal smear campaign believed to have been orchestrated by his own party rivals, including New York governor [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]]. Hamilton also opposed Burr, due to his (still controversial) belief that Burr had entertained a Federalist secession movement in New York. But Hamilton exceeded himself at one political dinner, where he said that he could express a "still more despicable opinion" of Burr. After a letter regarding the incident written by Dr. [[Charles Cooper|Charles D. Cooper]] circulated in a local newspaper, Burr sought an explanation from Hamilton.

Hamilton had written so many letters, and made so many private tirades against Burr, that he claimed that he could not reliably comment on Cooper's statement.  Instead Hamilton responded casually by educating Burr on the many possible meanings of despicable, enraging and embarrassing Burr. Burr then demanded that Hamilton recant or deny anything he might have said regarding Burr<U+2019>s character over the past 15 years, but Hamilton, having already been disgraced by the [[Maria Reynolds]] scandal and ever mindful of his own reputation and honor, did not. Burr responded by challenging Hamilton to personal combat under the ''[[code duello]]'', the formalized rules of dueling. Both men had been involved in duels (though most never reached the dueling field) in the past (for Hamilton 21, for Burr 1), and Hamilton's eldest son, Philip, had died in a duel in 1801.

Although still quite common, dueling had been outlawed in New York and was legal in New Jersey, but Hamilton and Burr were not citizens of New Jersey, so on July 11 1804, the enemies met outside of Weehawken, New Jersey, and Hamilton was mortally wounded. There has been some controversy as to the claims of Burr's and Hamilton's seconds; while one party indicates Hamilton never fired, the other claims a 3 to 4 second interval between the first shot and the second shot.[http://www.thedailystar.com/opinion/columns/2004/07/10/ham.html]  Hamilton's shot missed Burr, but Burr's shot was fatal. The bullet entered Hamilton's [[human abdomen|abdomen]] above his right [[hip (anatomy)|hip]], piercing Hamilton's [[liver]] and [[vertebral column|spine]]. Hamilton was evacuated to Manhattan where he lay in the house of a friend, receiving visitors until he died the following day. Burr was later charged with multiple crimes, including [[murder]], in New York and New Jersey, but was never tried in either jurisdiction. He fled to South Carolina, where his daughter lived with her family, but soon returned to Philadelphia and then on to Washington to complete his term as Vice President. As leader of the Senate he presided over the impeachment (trial) of Samuel Chase. It was written by one Senator that Burr had conducted the proceedings with the "impartiality of an angel and the rigor of a devil." Burr's heartfelt farewell in March 1805 moved some of his harshest critics in the Senate to tears.  Unfortunately, except for short quotes and descriptions of the address, which defended America's system of government, it was never recorded in full.

===Conspiracy and trial===
Burr had leased 40,000 acres (160 km<U+00B2>) of land in the Texas part of Mexico, in the "Bastrop" lands from the Spanish government.  His "conspiracy," he always avowed, was that if he settled there with a large group of (armed) "farmers" and war broke out, he would have an army with which to fight and claim land for himself, thus recouping his fortunes. However, that war in Texas didn't occur until 1836, the year of Burr's death.  

In 1805, General [[James Wilkinson]], chosen by Jefferson to be the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army at New Orleans and Governor of the Louisiana Territory, actually was a traitor. (It was revealed years later that at the time he was a spy, secretly in the pay of the Kingdom of Spain.) Wilkinson had his own reasons for aiding the so-called Burr conspiracy. As Territorial Governor, he could have seized power for himself, as he had attempted in earlier plots in Kentucky. Ignorant of the General's treason, Burr enlisted Wilkinson and others to his plan in a reconnaissance mission to the West in April 1805.

Another member of the Burr conspiracy was the Anglo-Irish aristocrat [[Harman Blennerhassett]]. After marrying his niece, Blennerhassett had been forced out of [[Ireland]]. He came to live as a quasi-[[feudal]] lord, owning [[Blennerhassett Island|an island now bearing his name]] in the Ohio River. Highly educated, Blennerhassett maintained a scientific laboratory and an impressive villa on the island. It was there that he met Burr and agreed to help finance the ambitions of Burr's group.

Like many of his countrymen, including Jefferson, Burr anticipated a war with Spain, a distinct possibility if someone other than Wilkinson commanded U.S. troops on the Louisiana border. In case of a war declaration, [[Andrew Jackson]] stood ready to help Colonel Burr, who had already purchased the land shares in [[Texas]]. Burr's expedition of perhaps eighty men carried modest arms for hunting, and no war ''[[materiel]]'' ever came to light, even when Blennerhassett Island was seized by [[Virginia]] [[militia]] (the island was just off shore from modern [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]]).  

After a near-incident with Spanish forces at [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], Wilkinson decided he could best serve his conflicting interests by betraying Burr's plans to President Jefferson and his Spanish paymasters. Jefferson's passivity throughout most of 1806 remains baffling to this day, but he finally issued a proclamation for Burr's arrest, declaring him a traitor even before an indictment. Burr read this in a newspaper in the [[Orleans Territory]] on [[January 10]], [[1807]].    Jefferson's warrant put Federal agents on his trail. He turned himself in to the Federal authorities twice. Two judges found his actions legal and released him. But Jefferson's warrant followed Burr, who then fled for [[History of Florida#Second Spanish Rule|Spanish Florida]]; he was intercepted in the vicinity of the [[Missouri Territory|Missouri]] and [[Alabama Territory|Alabama]] Territories on [[February 19]], [[1807]] and confined to [[Fort Stoddert]] after being arrested on charges of [[treason]].

Burr was treated well at Fort Stoddert.  For example, in the evening of [[February 20]], [[1807]], Burr appeared at the dinner table, and was introduced to Frances Gaines, the wife of the commandant [[Edmund  P. Gaines]] and the daughter of [[Harry Toulmin (Judge)|Judge Harry Toulmin]], the man responsible for the legal arrest of Burr. Frances and Burr played chess that evening and continued this entertainment during his confinement at the fort.

Burr's secret correspondence with [[Anthony Merry]] and the [[Carlos Mart<U+00ED>nez de Irujo y Tac<U+00F3>n|Marquis of Casa Yrujo]], the British and Spanish ministers at Washington, was eventually revealed. It had been, it would seem, to secure money and to conceal his real designs, which were probably to overthrow Spanish power in the Southwest, and perhaps to found a dynasty in what would have become former Mexican territory. This seems to have been a [[misdemeanor]], based on the [[Neutrality Act]] passed to block filibuster expeditions like those questionable enterprises of [[George Rogers Clark]] and [[William Blount]]. But Jefferson sought the highest charges against Burr, even though his informant, Wilkinson, was notoriously corrupt. It seems that both Jefferson and Burr gravely misjudged Wilkinson's character - Jefferson had personally put him in charge of the Army at New Orleans.  

In 1807, on a charge of treason, Burr was brought to trial before the United States [[Circuit Court]] at [[Richmond, Virginia]]. His defense lawyers were [[John Wickham (1763)|John Wickham]] and [[Luther Martin]].  Burr was arraigned four times for treason before a grand jury indicted him.  This is surprising, because the only physical evidence presented to the Grand Jury was Wilkinson's so-called letter from Burr, proposing stealing land in the Louisiana Purchase.  During the Jury's examination it was discovered that the letter was in Wilkinson's own handwriting - a "copy," he said, because he had "lost" the original.  The Grand Jury threw the letter out, and the news made a laughingstock of the General for the rest of the proceedings.  The trial, presided over by [[Chief Justice of the United States]] [[John Marshall]], began on [[August 3]]. 

[[Article Three of the United States Constitution#Section 3: Treason|Article 3, Section 3 of the United States Constitution]] requires that treason either be admitted in open court, or proved by an overt act witnessed by two people. Since no two witnesses came forward, Burr was acquitted on [[September 1]], in spite of the fact that the full force of the political influence of the Jefferson administration had been thrown against him.  Immediately afterward, he was tried on a more appropriate misdemeanor charge, but was again acquitted.

The trial was a major test of the Constitution.  It was carefully watched drama ([[Henry Adams]] gives a full account) as Thomas Jefferson wanted a conviction.  He challenged the authority of the Supreme Court and its Chief Justice John Marshall - an Adams appointee who clashed with Jefferson over judicial appointments that were signed up to the last minute of Adam's single term as president.  Thomas Jefferson believed that Aaron Burr's treason was obvious, and warranted a conviction.  (Burr had run off and declared himself "Emperor of Mexico") The actual case hinged on whether Aaron Burr was present at certain events at certain times and in certain capacities.  Thomas Jefferson used all of his influence to get Marshall to move to conviction, but Marshall was not swayed.

===Later life===
By this point all of Burr's hopes for a political comeback had been dashed, and he fled America and his creditors for [[Europe]], where he tried to regain his fortunes. He lived abroad from 1808 to 1812, passing most of his time in [[England]] where he occupied a house on Craven Street in London.  He became a good friend, even confidant, of the English [[Utilitarian]] philosopher, [[Jeremy Bentham]], even residing at Bentham's home on occasion.  He also spent time in [[Scotland]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], and France.  Ever hopeful, he solicited funding for renewing his plans for Mexico, but was rebuffed. He was ordered out of England and [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] refused to receive him -- although one of his ministers held an interview concerning Burr's aims for Spanish Florida or British possessions in the Caribbean.  After returning from Europe, Burr used the surname "Edwards," his mother's maiden name, for a while to avoid creditors.

===Death===
Burr suffered a debilitating stroke in 1834, which rendered him immobile.  In 1836, Burr died in Port Richmond, [[Staten Island]]. He is buried in [[Princeton Cemetery]] near his father and grandfather in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].

==Character==
According to his detractors, Burr could be unscrupulous, insincere, devious and amoral. In fact, towards his friends and family, he was a moral and  virtuous man, including his tenure in the Senate, pleasing in his manners and generous to a fault. 

He and his first wife would be called Feminists today.  He believed women to be intellectually equal to men, and hung a portrait of [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] over his mantle. The Burr's daughter, Theodosia, was taught dance, music, several languages and learned to shoot from horseback. Until her death at sea in 1813, she remained devoted to her father. Not only did Burr advocate education for women, upon his election to the New York State Legislature, he submitted a bill to allow women to vote.

In  her ''Autobiography of Jane Fairfield'', the wife of the struggling poet [[Sumner Lincoln Fairfield]] relates how their friend Burr saved the lives of her two children, who were left with their grandmother in New York while the parents were in Boston.  The grandmother was unable to provide adequate food or heat for the children and was in fear for their very lives. She sought out Burr, as the only one that might be able and willing to help her. Burr "wept and replied, 'Though I am poor and have not a dollar, the children of such a mother shall not suffer while I have a watch.' He hastened on this godlike errand, and quickly returned, having pawned the article for  twenty dollars, which he gave to make comfortable my precious babies." (Fairfield. p. 89) In his later years in New York, he practiced estate law and provided money and education for several children, earning their lifelong affection.

Although he proved irresistible to many women, few historians doubt Burr's devotion to his first wife while she lived. He was profligate in his personal finances, and gave lip service to [[abolitionism]] even though he owned one or two slaves for a time.  [[John Quincy Adams]] (who  was a great admirer of Jefferson ) said after the former Vice President's death, "Burr's life, take it all together, was such as in any country of sound morals his friends would be desirous of burying in quiet oblivion."  This was his own opinion: his father, President John Adams, was an admirer and frequent defender of Burr, as were many other prominent U.S. citizens of the time, despite the duel and the treason trial. Burr has been compared to other animated legal characters such as Daniel Webster, Johnny Cochran, or Caleb Buck.

In public and in private, Burr's behavior, even by his political foes, was labled as considerate and gracious. He was often commended as a great listener. Although much took place in Mr. Burr's life, he is remembered by many only for the deadly duel with Mr. Hamilton. However, his trial resulted in changing the definition for acts of treason in the Constitution, and his establishment of guides and rules for the first Senate impeachment trial set a high moral bar for behavior and procedures in that chamber, many of which are followed today. Finally, his silence and refusal to engage in defending himself from his political critics either in legislatures or in the press, plus the fact that most of his personal papers disappeared with his daughter, have left an air of mystery over his reputation. One must read his copious correspondence, such as it is, to gain more insight into the man.

{{s-ref|Clinton was a presidential candidate in 1792 and Burr was a presidential candidate in both 1796 and 1800.  Prior to the passage of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] in 1804, each presidential elector would cast two ballots; the highest vote-getter would become President and the runner-up would become Vice President.  Thus, in 1792, with George Washington as the prohibitive favorite to be elected President, the Democratic-Republican Party fielded George Clinton with the intention that he be elected Vice President.  Similarly, in both 1796 and 1800, the Democratic-Republican Party fielded two candidates, Burr and Thomas Jefferson, with the intention that Jefferson be elected President and Burr be elected Vice President.}}
