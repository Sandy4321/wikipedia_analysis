'''''Priwall''''' was a four-masted [[steel]]-[[hull (watercraft)|hulled]] [[barque]] with [[Royal (sail)|royal sails]] over double [[topsail|top]] and [[topgallant sail]]s.<ref name=Priwall/> The [[windjammer]] was ordered by the [[F. Laeisz]] shipping company of [[Hamburg]] and launched at the [[Blohm & Voss]] yard, Hamburg, on 23 June 1917. After delays arising from a shortage of materials during and after [[First World War]], she was completed on 6 March 1920.<ref name=Priwall2>{{cite web|url=http://www.bruzelius.info/Nautica/Ships/Fourmast_ships/Priwall%281917%29.html |title=Priwall |publisher=Lars Bruzelius |accessdate=17 February 2010}}</ref>  ''Priwall'' was used on the [[nitrate]] trade route to the west coast of South America; she also made several voyages from South Australia<U+2019>s [[Spencer Gulf]] grain ports to Europe.<ref name=Priwall/> Her [[code Letters]] were RWLN;<ref name=Priwall30/> in 1934 they were changed to DIRQ.<ref name=Priwall34>{{cite web|url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=34a0742.pdf |title=LLOYD'S REGISTER, NAVIRES A VOILES |publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref>

==History and performance==
While still at the builders, ''Priwall'' (with other German merchant vessels) was identified in 1919 for confiscation by the Allies as [[World War I reparations]].<ref name= "Carter, p. 120"/> However, due to the incomplete state of the ship, delivery to the Allies was not enforced and thus allowed the Laeisz company to finish construction <U+2013> and, after outfitting, to operate the ship as intended, carrying general cargo outbound and nitrate or grain to Europe.<ref name= "Carter, p. 120">{{harvnb|Carter|2004|p=120}}</ref>

''Priwall'' was one of the [[Flying P-Liner]]s that enhanced the reputation of her owners.  As with all Laeisz ships, ''Priwall'' was well maintained, and the company<U+2019>s captains were known as fine steersmen and bold sailors.<ref>Randier, Jean. ''Men and Ships around Cape Horn 1616-1939''.  New York: David McKay Company, Inc. 1969, p. 341</ref> During a 1932 voyage on [[Christmas Day]], the ship covered {{convert|384|nmi|km}} in 24 hours (an average speed of {{convert|16|kn|km/h}}).<ref name=Priwall2/> In 1935, she 'won' the [[Grain race|Great Grain Race]] by sailing from [[Port Victoria, South Australia|Port Victoria]] to [[Cobh|Queenstown]] in 91 days. In 1938, ''Priwall'' recorded the fastest ever ''westward'' rounding of [[Cape Horn]]<ref>"Rounding the Horn" is traditionally understood to involve sailing the roughly one thousand miles from [[50th parallel south|50 degrees south]] on one coast of South America to 50 degrees south on the other coast, the two benchmark latitudes of a Horn run</ref> by a commercial sailing ship in five days and fourteen hours under Captain Adolf Hauth.<ref>Stark, Willam F. ''The Last Time Around Cape Horn. The Historic 1949 Voyage of the Windjammer [[Pamir (ship)|Pamir]]''. New York: Carroll & Graf Publishers. 2003; p. 147  ISBN 0-7867-1233-3</ref><ref name= "Drumm p. 94">{{harvnb|Drumm|2001|p=94}}</ref><ref name=Stamp>{{cite web|url=http://web.me.com/myronpm/Topics/html/kaphoorn.htm |title=Cape Horn |publisher=Bjoern Moritz |accessdate=17 February 2010}}</ref> 

Her final voyage under Laeisz ownership commenced on 23 May 1939 at Hamburg, bound for [[Valparaiso]].<ref name= "Parrott p. 24">{{harvnb|Parrott|2004|p=24}}</ref>  During the voyage, on a rare mid-ocean meeting in the South Atlantic, ''Priwall'' passed by the [[Finland|Finnish]] barque ''[[Lawhill]]'' en route from South Australia to Europe with a cargo of grain; ''Priwall'' also sighted the liner {{SS|Cap Arcona||2}}. The ship rounded Cape Horn on 21 July in the gale-force winds of the southern winter as the last commercial windjammer completing this east-to-west passage, and reached the sheltered anchorage of [[Corral, Chile|Corral]], Chile. There the crew maneuvered the mizzen upper top yard to the foremast to replace its broken upper top yard. Continuing on to [[Talcahuano]] to off-load freight, she finally arrived at Valparaiso on 3 September 1939. ''Priwall'' was then interned at Valparaiso at the onset of the [[Second World War]].<ref name=Jurgens/> In 1941, to avoid potential seizure by the Allies, the ship was deeded as a gift to the Republic of Chile in a ceremony attended by the Governor of Valpara<U+00ED>so, Mr. Alfredo Rodr<U+00ED>guez Mac-Iver. Renamed ''Lautaro'', she was used as a cargo carrying [[training ship]] by the [[Chilean Navy]]. On 28 February 1945, while loading nitrate, she caught fire off the Peruvian coast and was destroyed.<ref name=Priwall2/>
