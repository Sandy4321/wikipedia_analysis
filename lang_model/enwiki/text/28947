{{nihongo|'''''Wolf's Rain'''''|<U+30A6><U+30EB><U+30D5><U+30BA><U+30EC><U+30A4><U+30F3>|Urufuzu Rein}} is an [[anime]] series created by [[writer]] and [[story editor]] [[Keiko Nobumoto]] and produced by [[BONES (studio)|BONES Studio]].  The series was directed by [[Tensai Okamura]] and featured character designs by Toshihiro Kawamoto with a soundtrack produced and arranged by [[Yoko Kanno]].  It focuses on the journey of four lone wolves who cross paths while following the scent of the Lunar Flowers.  They form a pack and decide to seek out the Flower Maiden in order to open the way to Paradise.  Along the way, they must avoid a fanatical wolf hunter and the nobles who wish to use the Flower Maiden to create their own Paradise. 

''Wolf's Rain'' spans twenty-six television episodes and four [[original video animation]] (OVA) episodes, with each episode running approximately twenty-four minutes.  The series was originally broadcast in Japan on [[Fuji TV]] and the anime [[communications satellite|CS]] television network, [[Animax]].  The complete thirty episode series is licensed for [[Region 1]] release by [[Bandai Entertainment]], in [[Region 2]] (Europe) by [[Beez Entertainment]] and in [[Region 4]] by [[Madman Entertainment]].  The series was adapted into a short <nowiki>two-</nowiki>[[tank<U+014D>bon|volume]] [[manga]] series written by Keiko Nobumoto and illustrated by Toshitsugu Iida.  The manga, which was released while the series was airing, is a retelling of the story rather than a straight adaptation. It was originally serialized in ''[[Magazine Z]]'' and has been released in [[North America]] by [[Viz Media]].

The anime series was well received in Japan, being the third ranked anime series in its time slot while airing on Fuji TV.  The Bandai Entertainment English language release sold well in North America.  It helped Bandai gain the 2004 Anime Company of the Year award from industry news company ICv2 in the ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga.  The manga adaptation was selected as one of their top ten anime products of 2005 and sold well in North America.  Reviewers of the series gave it high marks for characterization, visual presentation, and its soundtrack, while disparaging the existence of four recapitulation episodes in the middle of the series. The manga adaptation also sold well in North America and received good reviews, though reviewers felt its short length resulted in a rushed plot and neglected supporting characters.

==Plot==
According to an old legend, when the end of the world comes, Paradise will appear, however, only wolves will have access to it.  Although wolves are believed to have been hunted to extinction nearly two hundred years ago, they still exist, surviving by taking human form.<ref name="Ep1">{{cite episode |title=City Of Howls |series=Wolf's Rain |episodelink=List of Wolf's Rain episodes |number=1 }}</ref> Freeze City is a northern human city in a world where the majority of people live in poverty and hardship. 

[[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Kiba|Kiba]], an injured lone white wolf, goes to Freeze City following the scent of the Lunar Flower, which is the key to opening Paradise.  There he encounters [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Tsume|Tsume]], [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Hige|Hige]], and [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Toboe|Toboe]], three other wolves who were drawn to Freeze City by the scent of the Lunar Flower and are now living in the city.  The wolves encounter [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Quent Yaiden|Quent Yaiden]], a former Sheriff of Kyrios, obsessed with hunting down wolves, and his dog [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Blue|Blue]].  [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Cheza|Cheza]], the Flower Maiden who is destined to lead the wolves to Paradise, is being studied at a laboratory under the care of [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Cher Degr<U+00E9>|Cher Degr<U+00E9>]].  She is awakened by the smell of wolf's blood.  As Kiba and Hige approach the lab to find her, she is stolen away by [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Lord Darcia the Third|Lord Darcia the Third]], whose people created Cheza.

With the Flower Maiden gone, the wolves have no reason to stay in the city. Despite some initial misgivings and suspicions, they decide to stay together and follow Kiba in his search for the Flower Maiden and Paradise. As they pursue Cheza, the wolves travel through various cities and the remnants of former habitations. Cher joins the city's army to try to recover Cheza, while Cher's ex-husband [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Hubb Lebowski|Hubb Lebowski]] searches desperately for Cher, and Quent continues his relentless pursuit of the wolves.  When Blue eventually encounters Cheza, it awakens her wolf blood from dormancy and causes her to leave Quent and take on her own human illusion. She joins Kiba's pack and travels with them for a while, developing a relationship with Hige. After she becomes separated from the pack, she travels with Cher, while Hubb finds himself traveling with Quent, who is now searching for Blue as well as the wolves.

The wolves and the humans come together in Jaguara's city, where the captured Cheza is being held.  In attempting to rescue the abducted Cheza, Kiba, Tsume, and Toboe are captured.  Tsume and Toboe are thrown into a dungeon with Hubb while [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Jaguara|Jaguara]] attempts to use Kiba's blood to force Paradise to open.  Blue and Cher also make their way into the Keep, as does Quent.  Darcia interrupts the ceremony as Kiba and the other wolves break free and rush to free the Flower Maiden.  Darcia kills Jaguara and battles Kiba as Jaguara's keep collapses around them.  The wolves and the humans barely escape with their lives, and Quent is gravely wounded saving Blue from falling debris.

The wolves, now accompanied by Cheza, Cher, Hubb, and Quent, continue trying to make their way to Paradise, pursued by the now [[Insanity|insane]] Darcia.  A combination of environmental factors and Darcia's hostility cause most of the characters to die, leaving only Kiba, Cheza, and Darcia alive at the place where Paradise can be opened.  Darcia is killed when he attempts to enter Paradise, and Cheza's body disintegrates into seeds.  Fatally wounded, Kiba concludes that his quest has failed, but as he lays dying, rain begins to fall and Cheza's seeds grow into thousands of lunar flowers. 

At the series' close, Toboe, Tsume, Hige, and Kiba are in their human forms in a modern city.  Kiba, walking down a busy sidewalk, begins running towards a lunar flower lying in a puddle in an alley.

===Changes in manga adaptation===
The two-volume manga adaptation includes some of the core events of the anime series with few changes, but as a whole the manga veers greatly from its anime inspiration.  Many events from the anime do not occur in the manga, and some of the events from the anime that are presented in the manga are completely different in terms of dialogue, chronological sequence, and final outcomes.<ref name="Manga1" />  In particular, the second volume tells an almost completely different story, with Darcia recruiting Blue to help him open the door to Paradise with her blood.  The wolves must go to Darcia's keep, rather than Jaguara's, in order to free Cheza, with Kiba missing but appearing at the end to make the final rescue effort.  At the end of the manga, the four wolves and Cheza are sitting on a rock as the clouds break and sunlight streams through for the first time.  The world rejoices the end of the [[Ice Age]] and rumors that Paradise has been found abound.<ref name="Manga2">{{cite book |title=Wolf's Rain, Volume 2 |last=Nobumoto |first=Keiko |authorlink=Keiko Nobumoto |year=2005-02-01 |publisher=Viz Media| series=Wolf's Rain |isbn=1-59116-718-3}}</ref>

In the manga, most of the characters are similar in appearance and personality to their anime counterparts, but some characters seen in the anime do not appear in the manga, including the Nobles Lord Orkham and Lady Jaguara.<ref name="Manga1" /><ref name="Manga2" />

The character designs are equally striking: in their human form, the wolves wear contemporary outfits, making them the most accessible of all characters."|Carlo Santos|''Anime News Network''<ref name="ANNSeriesReview">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/wolf's-rain/dvd-1-7 | title=Wolf's Rain DVD 1-7 - Review | accessdate=2007-12-29 |date=2006-03-06 | author=Carlos Santos | publisher=Anime News Network }}</ref>}}

The main criticism voiced about the series tends to be aimed at episodes fifteen through eighteen which are four back-to-back recapitulation episodes that interrupted the series midway through its original airing.<ref name="ANNSeriesReview" /><ref name="AoDSeriesReview" />  While the episode had a few new bits of dialog and the occasional new scene, they are primarily made up of flashbacks that "contribute precious little to the otherwise interesting narrative."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/Wolfs-Rain-Recollections-Vol-4/dp/B000641YQO | title=Wolf's Rain - Recollections | accessdate=2007-12-29 |date=2006-03-06 | author=Charles Solomon, Editorial Reviewer | publisher=Amazon.com }}</ref> Reviewers of the [[Region 1]] DVD volume containing the four episodes recommended it be left unbought and skipped as a waste of money.  Bandai's release of the episodes was also considered an improvement over the Japanese release of the series which had the recapitulation episodes spread over two DVDs requiring them to be bought to get the new episodes on the same volumes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/3481.php | title=Wolf's Rain Vol. #4 (of 7) | accessdate=2007-12-29 |date=2004-12-13 | author=Chris Beveridge | publisher=AnimeOnDVD.com }}</ref><ref name="AoDSeriesReview">{{cite web |url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/3823.php | title=Wolf's Rain Vol. #7 (of 7) | accessdate=2007-12-29 |date=2004-04-13 | author=Chris Beveridge | publisher=AnimeOnDVD.com }}</ref>  Other critics have complained that while the show had an original and innovative storyline with beautiful visuals and appealing characters, the episodes themselves were poorly paced, undeveloped, and plagued with plot holes.<ref name="ANN_AskJohn" /> 

Yoko Kanno's soundtrack for the series has also been hailed for its beauty and the way it adds to the series' emotional impact.<ref name="ANNReview">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/wolf's-rain | title=Wolf's Rain - Review | accessdate=2007-12-29 |date=2004-03-12 | publisher=Anime News Network }}</ref><ref name="ANNSeriesReview" />  The instrumental tracks were found to mirror the show's tone perfectly, evoking feelings of sorrow and loss.  According to one reviewer, the soundtrack "...shows [Kanno's] skills as both composer and pianist..." and is "...a treat to hear."<ref name="AFMusicReview" /> Kanno's work in the series was nominated for an [[Annie Award]] in the "Music in an Animated Television Production" category in 2006.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://annieawards.com/32ndannieawardwinners.htm | title=32nd Annual Annie Award Nominees and Winners | date=2006-07-28 | publisher=AnnieAwards.com}}</ref>

The Wolf's Rain manga adaptation has also enjoyed success in the North American market, with the second volume being the ninth best selling graphic novel on the [[Nielsen BookScan]] list for February 13, 2007.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/6457.html | title=D.N.Angel Tops BookScan List | accessdate=2007-12-29 |date=2005-02-18 | publisher=ICv2 }}</ref>  It was considered a "major manga hit" among manga series adapted from an anime series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/8360.html | title='Onegai Twins' Manga From DrMaster | accessdate=2007-12-29 |date=2006-03-14 | publisher=ICv2 |quote=Both the Please Teacher and the Onegai Twins manga were adapted from popular anime series, a reversal of the usual pattern in Japan where a popular manga typically inspires an anime adaptation, but this anime-to-manga method has produced some major manga hits in the U.S. such as the ''Cowboy Bebop'', ''Wolf's Rain'', and ''Samurai Champloo'' manga series, all of which were based on anime.}}</ref>  While critics praised the artwork, some felt the short length resulted in a rushed story line that made it hard to connect to any of the characters and left the impression that supporting characters, Cher, Hubb and Quent, were included "just to have them included".<ref name="AnnMangaReview">{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/right-turn-only/2004-11-08 | title=Right Turn Only | accessdate=2007-12-30 |date=2004-11-08 |first=Liann |last=Cooper | publisher=Anime News Network }}</ref> Others partially agreed, both praising the "snappy pacing" while also considering it the primary downfall of the series.<ref name="AnnMangaReview GN1">{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/wolf's-rain-gn-1 | title=Wolf's Rain GN 1 Review | accessdate=2008-03-28 |date=2004-11-18 |first=Carlos |last=Santos | publisher=Anime News Network }}</ref>
