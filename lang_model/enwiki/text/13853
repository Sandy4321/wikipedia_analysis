'''''God of War''''' is a six-issue [[American comic book]] [[limited series]] set in the ''[[God of War (series)|God of War]]'' universe. The series was written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and illustrated by Andrea Sorrentino, with the cover art for each issue by [[Andy Park (comics)|Andy Park]], artist of the [[video game]] series. ''God of War'' was published by [[WildStorm]] until the company shut down in December 2010, leaving the final issue to be published by WildStorm's parent company, [[DC Comics]]. The series' launch coincided with the release of the video game ''[[God of War III]]'' in March 2010. The final issue was released in January 2011 and a collected edition released in March 2011.

The limited series chronicles the adventures of [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]], the protagonist of the video game series, and focuses on Kratos' past<U+2014>the period before upcoming game, ''[[God of War: Ascension|Ascension]]''<U+2014>and present<U+2014>the time between games ''[[God of War (video game)|God of War]]'' and ''[[God of War: Ghost of Sparta|Ghost of Sparta]]''<U+2014>quest for the Ambrosia of [[Asclepius]]. The two stories are told simultaneously, with Kratos first attempting to save his dying daughter, Calliope, and years later seeking to destroy the Ambrosia to prevent the resurrection of the former God of War, [[Ares]]. 

The series received mixed reviews. Wolfman's writing was praised and regarded as a good prequel to the video game series. Although the cover arts by Park were well received, the interior artwork by Sorrentino was criticized, being described as "muddy" by several reviewers.

==Publication history==
Announced at the 2009 [[Comic-Con International]], the series was scheduled to debut in October of that year, but was eventually delayed to coincide with the launch of ''[[God of War III]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heroesworldblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/god-of-war-comic-delayed.html|title=God of War comic&nbsp;<U+2013> delayed|date=November 25, 2009|author=coolasice|publisher=Heroes World Blog|accessdate=2012-09-17}}</ref> Scott A. Steinberg, Vice President of Product Marketing at [[Sony Computer Entertainment America|SCEA]] stated: "we are thrilled to work with the world's largest comic book publisher to bring one of our most beloved PlayStation franchises...to comic book fans." In an interview with [[IGN]], the series writer, Marv Wolfman, stated that when he heard rumor of the series, he "put [in his] name right away and kept pushing" to be chosen as the writer as ''God of War'' is one of his favorite video games. Wolfman stated that he had already played the first two games, so there was no research to be done and "it's because [he] loved the game that [he] wanted to do the comic." Wolfman also received copies of the scripts for all the games to ensure his work was as accurate as possible. Wolfman also stated that he worked very closely with [[SCE Santa Monica Studio|Sony Santa Monica]]<U+2014>the developer of the video games<U+2014>and he used the comic to tie in directly to the story they created. He said that Santa Monica ensured the mythology was consistent while revealing new facts about Kratos' past.<ref>{{cite web |first=Richard |last=George |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/100/1003469p1.html |title=The God of War is Summoned |publisher=[[News Corporation]]|work=[[IGN]] |date=July 14, 2009 |accessdate=2010-01-02 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Ekstrom |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/070925-sdcc-WildStorm.html |title=SDCC 09: WildStorm Panel: New Teams, New Books, New Storm |publisher=TechMediaNetwork|work=[[Newsarama]] |date=July 26, 2009 |accessdate=2010-01-02 }}</ref> 

In an interview with [[Comic Book Resources]], Wolfman stated that Santa Monica suggested using two different time periods, with events in the past affecting the present. Wolfman also introduced new characters, including Kratos' wife<U+2014>whom appeared in the games but was never named. He stated the final script was a combination of his ideas and Santa Monica's character-appropriate dialogue.<ref name="CBR">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25383|title=Wolfman and Sorrentino Declare (God of) War|date=March 24, 2010|last=LeTendre|first=Brian|publisher=Boiling Point Productions|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=2012-09-17}}</ref>

The series artist, Andrea Sorrentino, stated "...it was clear from the start that for this project Sony and DC [Comics] wanted something a bit different from a 'classical' comic. So I just took my usual style and added to it something new, like new colors from the videogame palette." She stated that the games have very epic and strong images, and that it was easy to adapt her style to Wolfman's writing as he "did really good work showing both dramatic and epic scenes." Sorrentino also stated that she tried to give a chromatic importance to each scene, adding hot colors (red or orange or brown) in action scenes and cold ones (green or light blue) in others so that readers could immediately have emotional feedback.<ref name="CBR"/>

The series was released on a bi-monthly schedule, with a new issue releasing every two months from March 2010 until January 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/comics/god-of-war|title=God of War Comics|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2012-09-17}}</ref> In March 2011, the series was collected into a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]].<ref>{{cite book|title=God of War|url=http://books.google.co.ve/books?id=IbehSgAACAAJ|isbn=1-4012-2972-7|date=March 22, 2011|publisher=DC Comics|author=Marv Wolfman|pages=144|accessdate=2012-10-17}}</ref>

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
As with the video games, the comic book series is set in an alternate version of [[Ancient Greece]], populated by the gods and other beings present in [[Greek mythology]]. The story itself is split between two chapters in the video game chronology: a period in the past prior to ''[[God of War: Ascension|Ascension]]'', and a period between ''[[God of War (video game)|God of War]]'' and ''[[God of War: Ghost of Sparta|Ghost of Sparta]]'' that represents the present. For the majority of the series, the story narrates the events of the past via flashback with occasional focus on present events. In both, protagonist [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] traverses Ancient Greece and the [[Aegean Sea]] on a quest for the Ambrosia of [[Asclepius]].

===Characters===
{{main|List of God of War characters}}
As an extension of the video game series, the continuing protagonist is Kratos. The story references two periods in the character's life: his boyhood training and past life in the Spartan Army as the unwitting champion of the God of War, [[Ares]]; and the present, in which he has assumed the god's role after [[God of War (video game)|defeating Ares]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|artist=Sorrentino, Andrea|letterer=Temofonte, Saida|editor=[[Ben Abernathy|Abernathy, Ben]]|title=God of War|issue=#1|date=March 2010|publisher=[[WildStorm]]|page=5|panel=1}}</ref>

===Plot===
The story is set after Kratos' defeat of the former God of War, Ares.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|artist=Sorrentino, Andrea|letterer=Temofonte, Saida|editor=[[Ben Abernathy|Abernathy, Ben]]|title=God of War|issue=#1|date=March 2010|publisher=[[WildStorm]]|page=1|panel=1}}</ref> Kratos, as the new God of War, is on a quest to destroy the legendary Ambrosia of [[Asclepius]], an [[elixir]] with magical healing properties that he once found when he was a soldier in Sparta. During his quest, Kratos has flashbacks to this time, searching for the Ambrosia to save his new-born daughter, Calliope, then a sufferer of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. Given until the next full moon, General Kratos travels with a host of Spartans to find the Ambrosia. During this period, Kratos also takes counsel from Captain Nikos, Kratos' then-superior in the Spartan army who instructs him about the Spartan code of honor. Nikos eventually passes on the rank of Captain to Kratos when he sacrifices himself to save Kratos.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|artist=Sorrentino, Andrea|letterer=Temofonte, Saida|editor=[[Ben Abernathy|Abernathy, Ben]]|title=God of War|issue=#4|date=September 2010|publisher=[[WildStorm]]|page=6|panel=3}}</ref>

Several of the Olympian Gods<U+2014>Artemis, Hades, Helios, Hermes, and Poseidon respectively<U+2014>decide to enter into a wager with Ares. Each will choose a champion who is in search of the Ambrosia, with each champion having their own reasons for needing it. The god whose champion is successful will receive statues erected in [[Greece]] in honor of the god, or the equivalent (e.g. Hades wishes to have a statue in a newly constructed temple that will overpower [[Pandora]]'s Temple).<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|artist=Sorrentino, Andrea|letterer=Temofonte, Saida|editor=[[Ben Abernathy|Abernathy, Ben]]|title=God of War|issue=#1|date=March 2010|publisher=[[WildStorm]]|page=15|panel=1}}</ref>

Kratos kills two of the champions<U+2014>Herodius and Pothia<U+2014>and repels attacks by various monsters sent by the gods to thwart him, although a desperate Hades kills Nikos, who sacrifices himself for Kratos. Danaus is killed by Alrik, with the barbarian retaining his head to possess his magical ability.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|artist=Sorrentino, Andrea|letterer=Temofonte, Saida|editor=[[Ben Abernathy|Abernathy, Ben]]|title=God of War|issue=#3|date=July 2010|publisher=[[WildStorm]]|page=17|panel=1}}</ref> Kratos locates the "Tree of Life", the source of the Ambrosia located on a small island, and confronts Cereyon. After being almost burned alive, Kratos drowns his foe and successfully retrieves the Ambrosia, but on leaving, he and his Spartan troops are ambushed by Alrik's horde of barbarians.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|artist=Sorrentino, Andrea|letterer=Temofonte, Saida|editor=[[Ben Abernathy|Abernathy, Ben]]|title=God of War|issue=#4|date=September 2010|publisher=[[WildStorm]]|page=18|panel=5}}</ref>When Hades observes the Spartans defeating the Barbarians, the god attempts to have the Spartans dragged to Underworld. Alrik uses the head of Danaus to summon [[roc (mythology)|roc]]s to attack Kratos as he flies away on a roc with the stolen Ambrosia. Kratos pursues Alrik on a captured roc, knowing that although his men will be taken to the Underworld, they will be honored in Sparta for their sacrifice. Alrik and Kratos battle, with Alrik critically wounding Kratos. The Spartan, however, is subsequently healed by the powers of the Ambrosia, which sprayed him during battle.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|artist=Sorrentino, Andrea|letterer=Temofonte, Saida|editor=[[Ben Abernathy|Abernathy, Ben]]|title=God of War|issue=#5|date=November 2010|publisher=[[WildStorm]]|page=16|panel=3}}</ref>

Kratos gains control of the head of Danaus and uses its power against Alrik, who is torn apart by rocs. Having also been covered with the Ambrosia, Alrik is revived only to be killed once again until the Ambrosia is spent. Kratos then escapes and returns to Sparta with the Ambrosia, saving his daughter, and giving the King of Sparta the rest of the elixir. Kratos is then officially awarded the rank of Captain in the Spartan army.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|artist=Sorrentino, Andrea|letterer=Temofonte, Saida|editor=[[Ben Abernathy|Abernathy, Ben]]|title=God of War|issue=#6|date=January 2011|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|page=14|panel=6}}</ref> Bitter at having lost the wager, Hades resurrects Alrik, who becomes King after his father dies and swears vengeance against Kratos.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|artist=Sorrentino, Andrea|letterer=Temofonte, Saida|editor=[[Ben Abernathy|Abernathy, Ben]]|title=God of War|issue=#6|date=January 2011|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|page=16|panel=5}}</ref>

In the present, Kratos overcomes several obstacles in his quest to find the Ambrosia, including defeating a giant [[spider]],<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|artist=Sorrentino, Andrea|letterer=Temofonte, Saida|editor=[[Ben Abernathy|Abernathy, Ben]]|title=God of War|issue=#3|date=July 2010|publisher=[[WildStorm]]|page=7|panel=1}}</ref> ignoring Athena's pleas to stop his quest, and overcoming the reanimated corpses of Captain Nikos and his men<U+2014>a final attempt by Hades to stop the Spartan.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|artist=Sorrentino, Andrea|letterer=Temofonte, Saida|editor=[[Ben Abernathy|Abernathy, Ben]]|title=God of War|issue=#3|date=July 2010|publisher=[[WildStorm]]|page=21|panel=5}}</ref> On returning to the island, Kratos discovers that the island itself is in fact one of the Chaos Giants, Gyges. An outraged Gyges explains that Kratos thwarted the Giant's plans: having intended to use the elixir to resurrect his brothers [[Hekatonkheires|Briareus]] and [[Hekatonkheires|Cottus]] and then reclaim the world. Kratos' fiery battle with Cereyon inadvertently burned off the one hundred arms of the fifty-headed Gyges, with Kratos then stealing the Ambrosia. Now lacking arms and unable to reach the Ambrosia, Gyges was forced to wait for Kratos' return. During the battle with Gyges, Kratos reveals that he seeks to destroy the elixir to prevent the worshippers of the slain god Ares from resurrecting their master. Kratos uses the Fire of Apollo to destroy both the Tree of Life and Gyges.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|artist=Sorrentino, Andrea|letterer=Temofonte, Saida|editor=[[Ben Abernathy|Abernathy, Ben]]|title=God of War|issue=#6|date=January 2011|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|page=20|panel=3}}</ref>

==Reception==
[[File:GoWcomic art.jpg|thumb|right|Andrea Sorrentino's artwork from ''God of War'' #3: described as "muddy."]]
The ''God of War'' comic series received mixed reviews. Mike Murphy of Platform Nation stated that although the comic series serves as a good prequel to the video game series, "the story is bogged down by horrible art...[it's] muddy, confusing, and consistently pulls you out of the story as you try to figure out just what is going on from panel to panel." Rating it 5 out of 10, Murphy said that he "can<U+2019>t give this one a pass, even to the hardcore ''God of War'' fans" who should "skip it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.platformnation.com/2011/05/23/god-of-war-review-comic/|title=God of War Review (Comic)|date=May 23, 2011|last=Murphy|first=Mike|publisher=Platform Nation|accessdate=2012-10-02}}</ref>

[[GameSpot]] stated that the art appears "moody," but also regarded it as "muddy...with a heavy digital assist from Photoshop." Although the effects were sometimes "stunning," other times they were "distracting, or even chuckle-inducing." Despite the criticism over the art, GameSpot claimed that it is "distinctive, and lends the story a very specific tone." They claimed that "It matches the world of ''God of War'' well enough,...the same way Kratos' anger overshadows any possible storytelling subtlety in the [video game] series."<ref name="GSandCV"/> [[Comic Vine]] claimed that "The idea here screams comic books," however, the "results were a mixed offering." The reviewer stated that the idea for Kratos finding the Ambrosia to save Calliope was a "perfect comic book incentive," however, things started to "fall apart" when the distinction between the present and the past became unclear.<ref name="GSandCV">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/are-game-based-comics-worth-reading-6377803/?page=4|title=Are game-based comics worth reading?|date=May 22, 2012|author=Staff|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2012-10-03}}</ref>
