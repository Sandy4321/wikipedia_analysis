'''Crime in Portugal''' is characterized by relatively low levels of [[gun violence]] and [[homicide]], compared to other [[developed country|developed countries]]. [[Crime]] statistics are compiled annually by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] Ministry of Internal Administration and the [[Pol<U+00ED>cia de Seguran<U+00E7>a P<U+00FA>blica]] which represents crimes reported to the [[police]].

The country's overall crime rate is reflected through Index crimes, which include [[homicide]], forcible [[rape]], [[robbery]], [[assault]], classified as [[violent crime]]s. Property crimes include [[burglary]], [[larceny]]/[[theft]], [[motor vehicle theft]], and [[arson]]. Statistics for index offenses are generally available for both the country as a whole and by region. The crime rate is measured by the number of crimes being reported per 100,000 people.  While the crime rate had risen in the 1990s, bringing it to a constant all-time high during much of this period, it still is relatively low compared to other developed countries, and has decreased in the 2000s. However, violent crime have risen during the same period.<ref>{{pt icon}} "''Portugal surge em terceiro lugar no ranking dos pa<U+00ED>ses da Uni<U+00E3>o Europeia (UE) onde mais aumentou o n<U+00FA>mero de crimes violentos e de roubos na d<U+00E9>cada de 1995 a 2005.''", Lic<U+00ED>nio Lima, [http://dn.sapo.pt/2007/11/27/sociedade/crescem_o_roubo_e_crime_violento.html Crescem o roubo e crime violento], [[Di<U+00E1>rio de Not<U+00ED>cias]] (27th November 2007) </ref><ref>[http://www.policiajudiciaria.pt/htm/dados_estat/dist_global.htm Distribui<U+00E7><U+00E3>o da evolu<U+00E7><U+00E3>o global - Todos os Departamentos], [[Pol<U+00ED>cia de Seguran<U+00E7>a P<U+00FA>blica]]</ref><ref>"The greatest rises were in France, Greece and Portugal (16%),...", [http://www.crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk/statistics30.htm International Review of Crime Statistics], International Review of Crime Statistics</ref>

==Overview==
Portugal has a relatively low rate of [[violent crime]]; however, [[petty crime]] is a reality in some areas. Ordinary citizens may become targets of pickpockets and purse snatchers at crowded popular tourist sites, restaurants, or on public transportation in the largest cities, in particular Lisbon and Porto metropolitan areas. While thieves may operate anywhere, the largest number of reports of theft received by the authorities usually are from the heavily populated areas and major tourist destinations.<ref name= "US dep state">[http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1002.html US Department of State, TRAVEL.STATE.GOV - Portugal], [[US Department of State]]</ref>

Portugal's largest metropolitan areas of [[Lisbon Metropolitan Area|Lisbon]] and [[Porto Metropolitan Area|Porto]] are the main sources of both petty crime and violent crime.

*[[Greater Lisbon]]: Thefts have been reported in tourist locations in the Greater Lisbon area in such tourist places like the towns of [[Sintra]], [[Cascais]], and [[Mafra]]. Some places were known for its bad reputation. Casal Ventoso, a neighborhood of [[Lisbon]] where drug traffickers and drug users used to gather, was demolished as a solution. [[Amadora]] the municipality where Buraca and the feared Cova da Moura neighborhood is located, a stopping point of many of the displaced people of the former Casal Ventoso, and Marvila, a parish in eastern Lisbon municipality, as well as some areas of the municipalities of [[Odivelas]], [[Loures]] and [[Vila Franca de Xira]] around the Portuguese capital, have an higher incidence of crime. Automobile break-ins sometimes occur in parking areas at tourist attractions and near restaurants. There are reports of organized crime and gangs.

*[[Greater Porto]]: There have been reports of theft and violent crime in the area. Some places such as train stations, the Ribeira neighborhood in [[Porto]], as well as some areas of [[Gondomar, Portugal|Gondomar]] and [[Valongo]] municipalities have been specially problematic. There are reports of organized crime and gangs.

*[[Algarve]]: There are no reports of organized crime or gangs, however, pick pocketing, while infrequent and purse snatching, may occur.

*[[Azores]] (archipelago): Pick pocketing and purse snatching are not common occurrences in the Azores. There are no reports of organized crime or gangs. 

*[[Madeira]] (archipelago): Pick pocketing, while infrequent, may occur in some areas of [[Funchal]].

Crime was a major source of discontent, and sentiment that Portugal was becoming increasingly unsafe since the country turned a destination to several thousand emigrants from diverse locations around the globe (in particular from Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Brazil and the former Portuguese territories in Africa - the PALOP countries) after 1990, led to the dismissal of Internal Administration Minister [[Fernando Gomes]] (a former mayor of the city of Porto) in the early 2000s on the heels of gang violence that made headlines.<ref>{{pt icon}} Ricardo Dias Felner, "''Com o sindicalismo encaminhado, e Coelho promovido para a pasta do Equipamento, o ministro Fernando Gomes acabaria por ser v<U+00ED>tima (para al<U+00E9>m do caso Barrancos, com calend<U+00E1>rio ciclicamente previs<U+00ED>vel) da dramatiza<U+00E7><U+00E3>o de um outro fen<U+00F3>meno determinante no MAI: o aumento da criminalidade, violenta, juvenil e grupal, e do sentimento de inseguran<U+00E7>a.

In addition, with the development and modernization of the [[Economy of Portugal|economy]] within the [[globalization]] process, [[corporate crime]], [[financial crime]] and [[corruption]] are heavily punished and increasingly important issues.

==Victims==
Victims of a crime, must report to the nearest police department. The national telephone emergency number is the [[1-1-2|112]], which is used in the entire [[European Union]]. The law enforcement system assists the victim to find appropriate medical care, contact family members or friends and explain how further legal procedures could be used. Although the investigation and prosecution of the crime is the responsibility of local authorities which include main police forces such as the [[Pol<U+00ED>cia Judici<U+00E1>ria]] (criminal investigation police), the [[Pol<U+00ED>cia de Seguran<U+00E7>a P<U+00FA>blica]] (regular urban police), and the [[Guarda Nacional Republicana]] (gendarmerie), officers can help the victim to understand the criminal justice process and to find an attorney if needed. Portugal has a crime victim's assistance program, administered through an organization known by its acronym, "APAV" ([[Associa<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Portuguesa de Apoio <U+00E0> V<U+00ED>tima]]).<ref name= "US dep state"/>

==Criminal penalties==
Persons violating [[Law of Portugal|Portugal's laws]], even unknowingly, may be arrested or imprisoned. In the 19th century, Portugal was one of the first countries in the world to abolish [[death penalty]]. Maximum jail sentences are limited to 25 years. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Portugal are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Engaging in sexual conduct with children or using or disseminating child pornography in Portugal is a crime. A foreign citizen is subject to Portugal's laws and regulations, which sometimes differ significantly from those in the foreign citizen's country.<ref name= "US dep state"/>
