The '''Hue chemical attacks''' occurred on June 3, 1963 when soldiers of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) poured liquid chemicals from tear gas grenades onto the heads of praying [[Buddhist]]s in [[Hu<U+1EBF>]], [[South Vietnam]]. The Buddhists were protesting against religious discrimination by the regime of the [[Roman Catholic]] President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]]. The attacks caused 67 people to be hospitalised for blistering of the skin and respiratory ailments. The protests were part of the [[Buddhist crisis]], during which the Buddhist majority in South Vietnam campaigned for religious equality after [[Hue Vesak shootings|eight people were killed by government forces]] while defying a ban that prevented them from flying the [[Buddhist flag]] on [[Vesak]]. The incident prompted the [[United States]] to privately threaten to withdraw support for Diem's government and when the Americans finally reduced aid a few months later, the army took it as a green light for a coup. 

An inquiry determined that the chemical used in the attack was a liquid component from old French [[tear gas]] grenades that failed to vapourise as they should have done. The findings exonerated the ARVN soldiers from charges that they had used [[poison gas|poison]] or [[mustard gas]]. However, the outcry over the attack had already forced Diem to appoint a panel of three cabinet ministers to meet with Buddhist leaders for negotiations regarding religious equality. The talks led to the signing of the [[Joint Communique]], but the policy changes it provided were not implemented and widespread protests continued, leading to the [[Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|assassination of Diem]] in a [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|military coup]].

As a member of the [[Roman Catholicism in Vietnam|Catholic Vietnamese]] minority, he pursued pro-Catholic policies that antagonized many Buddhists.

[[Image:Flag of Buddhism.svg|left|thumb|The Buddhist flag]]
On May 7, 1963, government officials invoked a rarely enforced 1958 law known as Decree Number 10 to prohibit the display of religious flags, forbidding Buddhists from flying their [[Buddhist flag|flag]] on [[Vesak]], the birthday of [[Gautama Buddha]]. The application of the law caused indignation among Buddhists in the lead-up to the most important religious festival of the year, as Catholics had been allowed to display Vatican flags a week earlier at a celebration for Diem's brother, Archbishop [[Ngo Dinh Thuc]].<Ref>Hammer, pp. 103&ndash;105.</ref><Ref>Jacobs, p. 142.</ref> On May 8, 1963, in Hu<U+1EBF>, a crowd of Buddhists protested against the ban on Vesak, which the police and army broke up by opening fire and throwing grenades at the demonstrators, leaving eight dead.<Ref>Jacobs, p. 143.</ref><Ref>Hammer, pp. 113&ndash;114.</ref>

Diem's denial of governmental responsibility for the incident&mdash;he instead blamed members of the [[Vietcong]] insurgency&mdash;led to growing discontent among the Buddhist majority. The incident spurred a protest movement by Buddhists against the [[religious discrimination]] of Diem's Roman Catholic-dominated regime. The dispute came to be known as the Buddhist crisis, and it provoked widespread and large-scale civil disobedience throughout South Vietnam, persisting throughout May. The objective of the protests was to have Decree Number 10 repealed, and to force the implementation of religious equality.<Ref>Jacobs, pp. 144&ndash;147.</ref><ref>Jones, pp. 252&ndash;260.</ref> At the time, the United States, the main backer of South Vietnam in the midst of the [[Cold War]], had 16,000 military advisors in the country to assist the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] in the [[Vietnam War|war against the Vietcong insurgency]], who sought to reunify Vietnam under communist rule. Washington wanted the dispute to be resolved quickly so that it would not dampen public morale and detract from the fight against the Vietcong.<Ref>Jacobs, pp. 100&ndash;102.</ref><ref>Karnow, pp. 305&ndash;312, 423.</ref>

== Incident ==

On June 3, Buddhists held another series of protests across the country. In the morning, attention focused on the capital [[Saigon]], where approximately 500 Buddhist laypeople, mostly youths, protested in front of the Government Delegate's office while 300 troops stood by. The crowd and a government official equipped with a loudspeaker exchanged taunts and accusations. When the official claimed that Vietcong were among the crowd and attempting to cause trouble, the troops aimed their firearms at the protestors.<Ref name=j2612/> When the crowd responded by taunting the soldiers as "stupid killers",<Ref name=j2612/> the troops [[bayonet#Commonwealth armies|fixed bayonets to their guns]] and put on gas masks before charging the protestors and throwing tear gas grenades at them. Some of the demonstrators ran away, while others remained stationary and began praying. Deaths and injuries were averted when a Buddhist leader urged the protestors to either retreat to a pagoda and receive medical treatment for the tear gas or to go home. When the entrance to the pagoda was blocked with barbed wire, some protestors simply sat on the ground and continued praying. After a standoff lasting almost three hours, troops wearing gas masks forcibly dispersed the crowd.<Ref name="j2612">Jones, pp. 261&ndash;262.</ref>

The situation was worse in Hu<U+1EBF>, where Diem had banned demonstrations and ordered his forces to arrest those who engaged in civil disobedience.<Ref name=j2634/><ref name=h136>Hammer, p. 136.</ref> At 1&nbsp;pm, some 1,500 protestors attempted to march towards [[Tu Dam Pagoda]] in Hu<U+1EBF> for a rally,<Ref name=j2634/> having gathered at Ben Ngu bridge near the [[Perfume River]].<Ref name=h136/> A confrontation ensued when the protestors attempted to cross the bridge. Six waves of ARVN tear gas and attack dogs failed to disperse the crowd.<Ref name=j2634/><Ref name=h136/><Ref name=j145/> Government officials stood on trucks, using loudspeakers to call out above the noise, urging the Buddhists&mdash;primarily high school and university students who had arrived on bicycles&mdash;to disperse. The announcements were met by jeers when the government spokesperson blamed the unrest on the Vietcong.<Ref name=j2612/> The worst incident occurred at 6:30&nbsp;pm, when the military personnel at the scene dispersed the crowd by emptying vials of brownish-red liquid on the heads of praying protestors, resulting in 67 Buddhists being hospitalised for chemical injuries.<ref name=j2612/><ref name=j145>Jacobs, p. 145.</ref> The symptoms consisted of severe blistering of the skin and respiratory ailments. The crowd responded angrily to what they suspected was the use of poison gas, and the incident became a public relations disaster for Diem.<Ref name=j2612/><ref name="j2634"/>

== Reaction and investigation ==

By midnight, tensions were high as a curfew and martial law were enacted.<Ref name=j2612/>  Rumours circulated that three people had died, and ''[[Newsweek]]'' reported that police had lobbed [[blister gas]] into the crowd. Reports citing reliable sources claimed that Diem was planning a military showdown against the Buddhists.<Ref name=j2612/><ref name="j2634">Jones, pp. 263&ndash;264.</ref> US consul John Helble suspected that the ARVN troops had used tear gas,<ref name=h136/> and in a report to the American embassy in Saigon, he noted that "possibly another type of gas which caused skin blisters" was used.<Ref name=j2612/> Helble reported that the substance, although unidentified, had raised concerns by the [[US State Department]] that poison gas was used because the symptoms were not consistent with standard tear gas.<Ref name=j2612/> If this were the case, Helble concluded that the United States should tell Diem that his regime must condemn the actions of the troops and punish the culprits.<Ref name=j2612/> If Diem did not, the United States should threaten to publicly condemn and distance itself from Saigon.<ref name="j2612"/> With the US also decrying the use of troops against civilian protests, the South Vietnamese government complained that unlike their Saigon counterparts, the Hu<U+1EBF> police were not trained in riot control. Diem's authorities requested that the Americans airlift 350 military police from [[Vung Tau]] in the far south to quell the protests in Hu<U+1EBF>, but the Americans refused.<ref name="j2634"/>

[[William Trueheart]], who was in charge of the US embassy in Saigon while Ambassador [[Frederick Nolting]] was on holiday, confronted Secretary of State [[Nguyen Dinh Thuan]] about the allegations of blister gas usage the next day. Thuan appeared to be astounded and asked Trueheart what blister gas was. Trueheart explained that the symptoms of the victims were consistent with those of [[mustard gas]] and passed on the US threat to denounce the regime for the chemical attacks.<Ref name=j2634/><Ref name=h136/> As a result, Thuan started an inquiry into the usage of chemical weapons on the protestors. The investigation went on to exonerate the Diem regime of the most serious allegations of using poison or mustard gas. Before the president was deposed in November, the inquiry's report declared that only tear gas was used, and that the liquified components of the grenades were poured onto the protestors after they had failed to vapourise as they were designed to. A further commission chaired by General [[Tran Van Don]] prior to February 1964 concluded that the tear gas was left behind by French colonial forces in the 1950s.<Ref name=j2634/> 

The tear gas used came in glass containers in the form of a liquid that was transformed into gaseous vapour upon activation by acid. The injuries were attributed to the acid failing to activate the liquid into gaseous form. US Army chemists in [[Maryland]] confirmed that the tear gas had come from canisters dating back to French [[World War I]] stocks.<Ref name=j2634/> During World War I, France had used tear gas containing a mixture of [[chloroacetone]] and [[ethyl bromoacetate]] against German troops at [[Ypres]] on the [[Western Front]],<Ref>Verwey, pp. 33&ndash;34.</ref> which was known to strongly irritate [[mucous membrane]]s.<ref>Verwey, p. 165.</ref> Chloroacetone turns brown-orange when exposed to light,<ref name=ipcs>{{cite web | url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics0760.htm | title=  Chloroacetone | accessdate = 2008-06-06 | publisher =  International Programme on Chemical Safety}}</ref><ref name=ohsa>{{cite web | url = http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthguidelines/chloroacetone/recognition.html | title= Occupational Safety and Health Guideline for Chloroacetone | accessdate = 2008-06-06 | publisher = U.S. Department of Labor - Occupational Safety & Health Administration}}</ref> while ethyl bromoacetate is a yellow liquid at tropical outdoor temperatures.<Ref>{{cite web|title= Ethyl 2-bromoacetate|url=http://chemicalland21.com/specialtychem/finechem/ETHYL%202-BROMOACETATE.htm |publisher=Chemical Land |accessdate=2009-03-29}}</ref> Both have similar colours to the liquid used on the demonstrators.<Ref>{{OrgSynth | author = Natelson, S.; Gottfried, S. | title = Ethyl Bromoacetate | collvol = 3 | collvolpages = 381 | year = 1955 | prep = cv3p0381}}</ref> Some varieties of French tear gas also contained [[phosgene oxime]]<ref>Verwey, p. 35. In chemical warfare terminology, [[phosgene]] is often used when [[phosgene oxime]] (a choking agent) is meant.</ref> or [[hydrogen cyanide]].<ref>Price, pp. 54&ndash;56.</ref> These two chemicals can be fatal, but none of the protestors in this incident died.<ref name=j145/>

== Repercussions ==

Diem responded to the controversy of the chemicals by agreeing to have formal talks with the Buddhist leaders. He appointed a three-member Interministerial Committee, which comprised Vice President [[Nguyen Ngoc Tho]] as chairman, Thuan and Interior Minister [[Bui Van Luong]].<Ref name=j2634/><Ref name=h136/> Despite continuing protests, including public [[self-immolation]]s by monks such as [[Thich Quang Duc]], a [[Joint Communique]] resulting from the discussions was signed in mid-June, which promised to end the Buddhist crisis. However, the Joint Communique was not implemented and the situation continued to deteriorate, particularly after the Ngo family ordered South Vietnam's [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces|Special Forces]] to [[Xa Loi Pagoda raids|attack Buddhist pagodas across the country]] on August 21. The US condemned the raids, and began to cut aid to the Special Forces, which was effectively a private Ngo family army, in addition to other government programs that were closely identified with the ruling clan. Regarding such gestures as a green light, and safe in the knowledge that the US would not intervene in Diem's defence, the army staged a [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|successful coup]] in November, resulting in the [[Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|assassination of the president]]. The removal of Diem resulted in a period of political instability, as a series of military juntas deposed one another. This led to a deterioration in the military situation as the communist [[Vietcong]] made substantial gains against the ARVN, prompting the US to deploy hundreds of thousands of combat troops in 1965, escalating the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Jacobs, pp. 150&ndash;170.</ref>
