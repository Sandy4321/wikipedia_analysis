The '''jaguarundi''' (''Puma yagouaroundi'') is a medium-sized wild [[felidae|cat]] that ranges from southern [[Texas]] in the [[United States]] south to [[South America]]. It has a total length of 88<U+2013>128 cm (35<U+2013>50 inches) and a weight of up to 9.1 kg (20 lbs).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/Arizona/Documents/Redbook/Jaguarundi%20RB.pdf |title=Jaguarundi (Felis yagouaroundi tolteca) |publisher=[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] |accessdate=2009-01-01 |format=[[PDF]]}}</ref> It has short legs and an appearance somewhat like an [[otter]]; the ears are short and rounded. For this reason, these animals are sometimes referred to as "otter cats." The coat is unspotted, uniform in colour, and varying from blackish to brownish grey (grey phase) or from foxy red to chestnut (red phase).

==Etymology and naming==
The two [[Color phase|colour phases]] were once thought to represent two distinct species; the grey one called ''jaguarundi'', and the red one called ''eyra''. However, these are the same species and both colour phases may be found in the same litter. Its coat has no markings except for spots at birth. In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''leoncillo'', which means ''little [[lion]]''. Other Spanish common names for the jaguarundi include: "gato colorado", "gato moro", "le<U+00F3>n brenero", "[[onza]]", and "tigrillo".<ref name="IUCN">{{IUCN2008 |assessors=Caso, A.; Lopez-Gonzalez, C.; Payan, E.; Eizirik, E.; de Oliveira, T.; Leite-Pitman, R.; Kelly, M.; and Valderrama, C. |year=2008 |id=9948 |title=Puma yagouaroundi |downloaded=1 January 2009}} Database entry includes justification for why this species is of least concern</ref>

==Taxonomy and evolution==
This cat is closely related to the much larger and heavier [[cougar]] as evident by its similar genetic structure and [[chromosome]] count; both species are in the genus ''[[Puma (genus)|Puma]]'' although it is sometimes classified under a separate genus, ''Herpailurus'' and until recently, both cats were classified under the genus ''[[Felis]]''.

According to a 2006 [[Genomics|genomic]] study of Felidae, an ancestor of today's  ''[[Leopardus]]'', ''[[Lynx]]'', ''[[Puma (genus)|Puma]]'', ''[[Prionailurus]]'', and ''[[Felis]]'' lineages migrated across the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]] into the [[Americas]] approximately 8 to 8.5 million years ago. The lineages subsequently diverged in that order.<ref name="Johnson2006">{{cite journal |first= W.E. |last=Johnson |coauthors=Eizirik, E.; Pecon-Slattery, J.; Murphy, W.J.; Antunes, A.; Teeling, E.; and O'Brien, S.J. |date=6 January 2006 |number=5757 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5757/73 |title=The Late Miocene radiation of modern Felidae: A genetic assessment |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=311 |issue=5757 |pages=73<U+2013>77 |doi=10.1126/science.1122277 |accessdate=2007-06-04 |pmid=16400146}}</ref> 

Studies have indicated that the cougar and jaguarundi are next most closely related to the modern [[cheetah]] of [[Africa]] and western [[Asia]],<ref name="Johnson2006"/><ref name="Culver">{{cite journal |first=M. |last=Culver |coauthors=Johnson, W.E., Pecon-Slattery, J., O'Brein, S.J. |year=2000 |title=Genomic Ancestry of the American Puma |journal=[[Journal of Heredity]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=186<U+2013>97 |url=http://www.coryi.org/Florida_panther/Miscellaneous_Panther_Material/Genomic%20ancestry%20of%20the%20American%20puma.pdf |format = PDF |doi=10.1093/jhered/91.3.186 |pmid=10833043}}</ref> but the relationship is unresolved. It has been suggested that ancestors of the cheetah diverged from the ''Puma'' lineage in the Americas and migrated back to Asia and Africa,<ref name="Johnson2006"/><ref name="Culver"/> while other research suggests the cheetah diverged in the [[Old World]] itself.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ross |last=Barnett |coauthors=Ian Barnes; Matthew J.

==Habitat==
Its habitat is lowland brush areas close to a source of running water. It occasionally inhabits dense tropical areas as well. It is [[crepuscular]] or [[nocturnal]], depending on location. This cat is comfortable in trees, but prefers to hunt on the ground. It preys upon [[fish]], small [[mammal]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[bird]]s.

==Reproduction==
The litter consists of one to four kittens. They are raised socially after a 70-day [[gestation]]. The kittens become mature at approximately 2 years of age.

==Conservation==
This cat is not particularly sought after for its [[fur]], but it is suffering decline due to loss of habitat. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has expressed concern that the presence of the Jaguarundi in South Texas may be imperiled due to loss of the cat's native habitat.<ref>http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/landwater/land/habitats/southtx_plain/endangered_species/</ref>

The jaguarundi has been sighted around the [[Guiana Space Centre]] in [[French Guiana]].<ref>[http://www.cnes.fr/html/_1016_1020_2964_.php Centre Spatial Guyanais - Un floril<U+00E8>ge de faune sauvage au CSG<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
