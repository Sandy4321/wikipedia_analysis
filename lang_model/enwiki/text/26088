{{afc comment|1=I really hesitated to decline this article - but it needs just a little more work. Your sources and inline citing of the references are very good, no problem there. Layout is also good, although what is that "Dryland company slogan =" doing above the infobox?<br />
I think the problem is more with the tone and focus of the article - it reads rather too favourably and not neutrally enough, and in my view there are too many direct quotations (probably contributing to the somewhat promotional tone) and not enough straight text written by you as the contributor. I am also a little concerned (but not enough by itself to prevent me from accepting the article) with the focus: the article is on Dryland, but quite a lot of the content is about Hunt. With a subject only a year old, this is understandable, but background material about Foxtons or Hunt himself should be limited to their respective articles except where it directly impacts on Drylands.<br />
Please feel free to discuss these issues with me directly on my talk page. If you feel you have addressed them, you can also ask me to have another look at the article immediately, rather than go through the AfC queue again.

'''Dryland''' is a British business members club co-founded by the UK property entrepreneur [[Jon Hunt]] and his daughter Emma. The first Dryland opened on London's [[Kensington High Street]] at the end of 2011, offering luxury work space.  

==History==
Media interest in Dryland has centred around the firm being one of the first public forays for its publicity-shy founder, Jon Hunt, since he sold [[Foxtons]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Foxtons sale nets founder <U+00A3>370m|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/may/21/privateequity|newspaper=Guardian|date=May 21, 2007|quote=The founder of London's largest estate agency Foxtons today sold the business to a private equity firm in a deal believed to have netted him a windfall of around <U+00A3>370m.

==Concept==

Dryland is notable for being the first "premium offering" in the serviced offices sector, providing members with luxury features such as a chauffeur-driven [[Maserati]], private dining courtesy of in-house chefs, and a concierge service.<ref>{{cite web|last=Monaghan|first=Angela|title=Jon Hunt Targets Luxury Offices for Spolit Businessmen|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/constructionandproperty/9624218/Jon-Hunt-targets-luxury-offices-for-spoilt-businessman.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|accessdate=3 December 2012|quote="Foxton founder Jon Hunt's latest venture has added a luxury sparkle to the traditional serviced offices model with chauffeur-driven Maseratis, in-house chefs, and networking events."}}</ref> The ''[[Financial Times]]'' has described Dryland as providing "...the atmosphere of a private members club and the hospitality of a five-star hotel."<ref>{{cite web|last=Freedman|first=Lisa|title=Best addressed|url=http://howtospendit.ft.com/property/9291-best-addressed|work=Financial Times How To Spend It|publisher=Pearson|accessdate=10 October 2012|date=SEPTEMBER 26 2012|quote=[Hunt's] noticed that, however generous your living quarters, working at home is not everyone<U+2019>s cup of tea.}}</ref> Dryland is also unusual among serviced office providers for its location in a high-end residential area not traditionally associated with office space.

==Locations==
The first Dryland club opened on [[Kensington High Street]] at the end of 2011. The Hunts plan to expand the concept to up to 20 Drylands in other central London neighbourhoods associated with high-income residents. Holborn, the City, [[Clerkenwell]], [[Soho]], and [[Covent Garden]] have been mentioned as possibilities.<ref>{{cite web|last=Davidson|first=Andrew|title=Notting Hill estate agent returns to his old manor|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/Companies/article863793.ece|work=The Sunday Times|publisher=News International|accessdate=10 October 2012|date=29 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Packard|first=Simon|title=Foxtons Sale Fuels Hunt<U+2019>s Move Into London Luxury Workspace|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-30/foxtons-sale-fuels-hunt-s-move-into-london-luxury-office-suites.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=26 July 2012|date=31st May 2012|month=May|year=2012|quote=Dryland seeks to combine prime office and business-lounge facilities with a luxury hotel-style service...the first club has a cafe, library and terrace as well as a conference center and meeting rooms.}}</ref>
