The '''MTA Bus Company''' ('''MTA Bus''' for short), a subsidiary of the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority (New York)|Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], is a public benefit corporation created to operate those bus routes formerly operated by private companies in the [[New York City]] area. The privately operated bus routes were taken over on a staggered schedule, beginning with [[Liberty Lines Express]] in January 2005 and ending with [[Triboro Coach|Triboro Coach Corp.]] in February 2006. The legal name of the corporation is the '''MTA Bus Company'''. There exist preliminary plans for the company to also take over bus operations of [[MTA New York City Transit|New York City Transit]] and [[MTA Long Island Bus|Long Island Bus]].[http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/capconstr/about.htm]

MTA Bus started to operate the former [[Liberty Lines Express]] bus routes on [[January 3]], [[2005]],  [[Queens Surface Corporation]] bus routes on [[February 27]], [[2005]], [[New York Bus Service]] bus routes on [[July 1]], [[2005]],  [[Command Bus Company]] bus routes on  [[December 5]], [[2005]], [[Green Bus Lines]] bus routes on [[January 9]], [[2006]] and [[Jamaica Buses]] bus routes on [[January 30]], [[2006]]. [[Triboro Coach|Triboro Coach Corporation]], the final remaining company, ceased operating and its routes have been operated by MTA Bus since [[February 20]], [[2006]].

Less than half of the MTA Bus fleet is still in the colors of the previous operators; however, repainting of these buses into standard MTA livery is in progress.
