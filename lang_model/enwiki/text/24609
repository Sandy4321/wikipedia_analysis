'''''Pennatomys nivalis''''' is an extinct [[Oryzomyini|oryzomyine]] rodent from the islands of [[Saint Eustatius]], [[Saint Kitts]], and [[Nevis]] in the [[Lesser Antilles]]. The only species in the genus '''''Pennatomys''''', it is known from skeletal remains found in [[Amerindian]] archeological sites on all three islands, with dates ranging from 790<U+2013>520 [[BCE]] to 900<U+2013>1200 CE. No live specimens are known, but there are several historical records of rodents from Saint Kitts and Nevis that could conceivably refer to ''Pennatomys''. The animal apparently belongs to a group within the [[tribe (taxonomy)|tribe]] Oryzomyini that includes many other island-dwelling species.

''Pennatomys nivalis'' was a medium-sized species without many distinctive adaptations. The [[nasal bone]]s were short and blunt-ended. The [[zygomatic plate]], a bony plate at the side of the skull, was broad. The bony [[palate]] was long and flat. The root of the lower [[incisor]] was housed in a bony protuberance, the [[capsular process]]. The [[molar (tooth)|molars]] were low-crowned and possess accessory crests such as [[mesoloph]]s. The upper molars all had three roots.

==Taxonomy==
[[Oryzomyini]], also known as rice rats, is a diverse grouping of North, Central, and South American rodents within the family [[Cricetidae]]. Remains of extinct rice rats are known throughout the Lesser Antilles, but the systematic relationships among those animals are poorly understood, and many species remain unnamed.<ref>Turvey et al., 2010, pp. 748<U+2013>500</ref> Rice rat fossils were first recorded from [[Saint Kitts]] in 1907 by archeologist C.W. Branch<ref>Branch, 1907, p. 332</ref> and were later found in abundance in [[Amerindian]] archeological sites on nearby [[Nevis]] and [[Saint Eustatius]].<ref name=Tea750>Turvey et al., 2010, p. 750</ref> The rice rat of these islands was formally described and named as ''Pennatomys nivalis'' in a 2010 article by zoologist Samuel Turvey and coworkers. The [[name of a biological genus|generic name]], ''Pennatomys'', combines the Latin ''pennatus'' "winged" with ''-mys'' "mouse", a standard element in the names of rodent genera, and honors archeologist [[Elizabeth Wing]].<ref name=Tea758>Turvey et al., 2010, p. 758</ref> The [[specific name]], ''nivalis'', is Latin for "snowy" and refers to Nevis. This island's name derives from the Spanish ''Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de las Nieves'' "Our Lady of the Snows", a reference to the clouds (mistaken for snow) that surround the island's central peak.<ref name=Tea761>Turvey et al., 2010, p. 761</ref>

[[Cladistics|Cladistic]] analysis of [[morphology (anatomy)|morphological]] characters suggest that ''Pennatomys'' is most closely related to a [[clade]], the ''Nectomys'' subclade, that includes members of ''[[Aegialomys]]'', ''[[Amphinectomys]]'', ''[[Nectomys]]'', ''[[Sigmodontomys]]'', ''[[Melanomys]]'', ''[[Megalomys]]'' (another Antillean rice rat), and possibly ''[[Nesoryzomys]]''. However, the exact position of ''Pennatomys'' was poorly resolved because of missing data.<ref name=Tea765>Turvey et al., 2010, p. 765</ref> Turvey and colleagues placed ''P.&nbsp;nivalis'' as the only member of its own genus because of its distinctive characters and the absence of evidence for close relationships with any other oryzomyine genus.<ref name=Tea763>Turvey et al., 2010, p. 763</ref> ''Pennatomys'' probably belongs to a subgroup of Oryzomyini known as "[[Oryzomyini#clade D|clade D]]". This clade contains a number of species only occurring on islands<U+2014>including members of ''Aegialomys'', ''Megalomys'', ''Nesoryzomys'', ''[[Noronhomys]]'', ''[[Oryzomys]]'', and ''Pennatomys''. Turvey and colleagues suggested that this is related to the high proportion of [[semiaquatic]] species in clade D<U+2014>most other oryzomyines are forest dwellers.<ref>Turvey et al., 2010, p. 766</ref> As a whole, Oryzomyini includes over a hundred species in about thirty genera.<ref>Weksler, 2006, pp.&nbsp;1, 10; Weksler et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;1, table&nbsp;1</ref> It is one of several tribes within the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family [[Cricetidae]], which encompasses hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents, distributed chiefly in Eurasia and the Americas.<ref>Musser and Carleton, 2005, ''passim''</ref>

==Description==
A medium-sized oryzomyine,<ref name=Teat2>Turvey et al., 2010, table&nbsp;2</ref> ''Pennatomys'' is known from a number of skeletal remains, many of which are fragmentary. Both skull and [[postcranial]] bones are represented.<ref>Turvey et al., 2010, pp. 760<U+2013>761</ref> Although there are no unusual adaptations in the known material, the animal possesses a combination of characteristics that distinguish it from all other known oryzomyines.<ref name=Tea759/> The skull is known only from fragments. The [[nasal bone]]s extend back to a point before or slightly behind the point where the [[maxilla]]ry, [[frontal bone|frontal]], and [[lacrimal bone]]s meet, and have a blunt back margin. The nasals extend slightly further back than the [[premaxilla]]ries.<ref name=Tea761/> The lacrimals [[articulation (anatomy)|articulate]] with both the frontals and the maxillaries, a trait that distinguishes ''Pennatomys'' from its closest relatives (which have lacrimals articulating mainly with the frontals).<ref name=Tea760/> The [[interorbital region]] of the skull bears weak crests at its sides. The [[zygomatic plate]], a bony plate at the side of the skull, is broad and its back margin is located in front of the first upper [[molar (tooth)|molar]] (M1). The [[incisive foramina]], openings in the bony [[palate]], extend back to a point next to the front root of M1. The palate itself is long and flat, extending beyond the third upper molars (M3). In the [[mandible (anatomy)|mandible]] (lower jaw), there is a [[capsular process]]<U+2014>a protuberance at the back of the jawbone that houses the root of the lower [[incisor]]. Below the molars, the upper and lower [[masseteric ridges]] (crests which support some of the chewing muscles) are sometimes conjoined towards the front, and they extend forward to a point below the first lower molar (m1).<ref name=Tea761>Turvey et al., 2010, p. 761</ref> The conjoined crests are one of the [[synapomorphic]] (shared-derived) characters of the ''Nectomys'' subclade.<ref name=Tea760/>

The maxillary toothrows are parallel to each other. The molars are [[bunodont]] (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests) and [[brachyodont]] (low-crowned) and have the inter-cusp valleys on the labial (outer) sides closed by a [[Cingulum (tooth)|cingulum]] (shelf). The valleys on the labial and lingual (inner) sides of the molars meet at the midlines.<ref name=Tea761/> Each of the upper molars has three roots<ref name=Tea762/><U+2014>unlike in most of the closest relatives of ''Pennatomys'', there is no additional labial root on M1.<ref name=Tea760/> The m1 has four roots<U+2014>two large roots at the front and back and two smaller ones in the middle. There are three roots under m2, two at the front and one at the back, and two under m3, at the front and back.<ref name=Tea762>Turvey et al., 2010, p. 762</ref> Upper toothrow length ranges from 5.6 to 6.7&nbsp;mm and lower toothrow length is 5.9 to 7.4&nbsp;mm.<ref name=Teat3>Turvey et al., 2010, table&nbsp;3</ref>

On M1, the [[anterocone]] (the cusp at the front of the tooth) is not divided into smaller cuspules. The connection between the [[protocone]] and the [[paracone]], the major cusps immediately after the anterocone, is located relatively far toward the front. Behind the paracone, the [[mesoloph]] accessory crest is present. On M2, there is no [[protoflexus]] (an indentation in front of the protocone, which on this tooth is the frontmost cusp) and the valley between the paracone and the mesoloph, the [[mesoflexus]], is not divided into two pieces by a paracone<U+2013>mesoloph connection.<ref name=Tea758/> These traits are both characteristic of the ''Nectomys'' subclade.<ref name=Tea760>Turvey et al., 2010, p. 760</ref> The mesoloph is present on M3, but the [[posteroloph]], a crest at the back of the tooth, is absent or [[vestigial]], as is the [[hypoflexus]] (the valley between the protocone and the cusp behind it, the [[hypocone]]).<ref name=Tea758>Turvey et al., 2010, p. 758</ref> The absence or near-absence of the posteroloph is a distinctive trait that differentiates ''Pennatomys'' from related oryzomyines.<ref name=Tea760/>

The [[anteroconid]] on m1 (the frontmost cusp, corresponding to the anterocone) contains an internal hollow, an anteromedian fossettid.<ref name=Tea758/> There is an [[ectolophid]], an accessory crest in the valley between the [[protoconid]] (the cusp on the labial side, behind the anteroconid) and the [[hypoconid]] (the cusp behind the protoconid, at the back labial corner of the tooth).<ref>Turvey et al., 2010, pp. 758<U+2013>759</ref> On the other side of the tooth, the [[mesolophid]] (another accessory crest) is also present. On each of the lower molars, an [[anterolabial cingulum]] (a shelf on the front labial corner) is present.<ref name=Tea759>Turvey et al., 2010, p. 759</ref> On m2 and m3, an [[anterolophid]] is present<U+2014>a crest in front of the [[metaconid]] (the cusp on the front lingual corner of the tooth).<ref name=Teat2/>

==Range and history==
Remains of ''Pennatomys nivalis'' come from several Amerindian archeological sites on each of the three islands where it has been found. The oldest site is [[Hichmans' Shell Heap]] on Nevis, which is from the Archaic age and is dated to 790 to 520&nbsp;[[BCE]]. The youngest, [[Sulphur Ghaut]] (900<U+2013>1200 CE), is also on Nevis, and is from the post-[[Saladoid]] period. Other sites on Nevis include [[Hichmans]] (Saladoid, 100 BCE <U+2013> 600 CE), [[Indian Castle]] (post-Saladoid, 650<U+2013>880 CE), and [[Coconut Walk]] (post-Saladoid, no absolute dates known). The only site on Saint Eustatius is the Saladoid and post-Saladoid site [[Golden Rock (archeological site)|Golden Rock]] (80 BCE <U+2013> 980 CE). Each of the three sites yielding ''Pennatomys'' on Saint Kitts is from the post-Saladoid period: [[Sugar Factory]] (700<U+2013>1000 CE), [[Bloody Point]] (660<U+2013>1115 CE), and [[Cayon]] (undated).<ref name=Tea750/>

Unambiguous historical records of ''Pennatomys'' are lacking, but there are some references to Saint Kitts and Nevis rodents that may relate to it. [[George Percy]] reported on the presence of "great store of Conies"{{#tag:ref|"Con(e)y" is an archaic word for "rabbit" that may also refer to other small mammals, like [[hyrax]]es, [[pika]]s, and guinea pigs.<ref>[http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/40913 coney | coney, ''n.''] Oxford English Dictionary. Downloaded January 3, 2011.</ref>|group="Note"}} on Nevis around 1606, probably a reference to the [[Dasyprocta|agoutis]] (''Dasyprocta'') that have been [[introduced species|introduced]] throughout the Lesser Antilles.<ref>Turvey et al., 2010, pp. 763<U+2013>764</ref> There are references from 1631 and 1720 to people eating rats on Saint Kitts and Nevis, respectively, but these may well have been introduced [[black rat]]s (''Rattus rattus''), not ''Pennatomys''. There are anecdotal records of unusual rats on Nevis up to recent times; these were reportedly eaten by the islanders until the 1930s.<ref name=Tea764>Turvey et al., 2010, p. 764</ref> The extinction of the Antillean rice rats, including ''Pennatomys'', may have resulted from the introduction of exotic animals such as the black rat and the [[small Asian mongoose]] (''Herpestes auropunctatus'') to the Lesser Antilles.<ref name=Tea767>Turvey et al., 2010, p. 767</ref>

There are no known morphological differences between the three island populations, but Turvey and colleagues found that animals from Nevis were slightly smaller than those from the two other islands. Such a difference in size might be related to the fact that Saint Kitts is larger than Nevis, in accordance with the trend that animals become larger on larger islands. However, Turvey and colleagues also observed that their Saint Kitts material consisted of older individuals than those from Nevis; thus, the size difference may result from differences in the mode of exploitation by Amerindians.<ref name=Tea763/>
