'''Marzb<U+0101>n''', or '''Marzp<U+0101>n'''{{sfn|Hoyland|2011|p=46}} ([[Middle Persian]] transliteration: mrzwpn, derived from ''marz'' "border, boundary" and the suffix ''-p<U+0101>n'' "guardian"; [[Modern Persian]]: {{lang|fa|<U+0645><U+0631><U+0632><U+0628><U+0627><U+0646>}} ''Marzb<U+0101>n'') were a class of [[margrave]]s, warden of the marches, and by extension military commanders,{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=503}} in charge of border provinces of the [[Parthian Empire]] (247 BC<U+2013>224 AD) and mostly [[Sasanian Empire]] (224<U+2013>651 AD) of [[Persia]].

==Etymology==
The Persian word ''marz'' is derived from [[Avestan]] ''mar<U+0259>za'' "frontier, border"; ''p<U+0101>n/p<U+0101>na'' is cognate with [[Avestan]] and [[Old Persian]] ''pat'' "protector". The word was borrowed from New Persian into Arabic as {{lang|ar|<U+0645><U+0631><U+0632><U+0628><U+0627><U+0646>}} ''marzub<U+0101>n'' (plural {{lang|ar|<U+0645><U+0631><U+0627><U+0632><U+0628><U+0629>}} ''mar<U+0101>ziba''). Al-Marzubani ({{lang|ar|<U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+0631><U+0632><U+0628><U+0627><U+0646><U+064A>}}) has been used as a ''[[Nisbat (onomastics)|nisba]]'' (family title) for some Iranian families whose ancestor was a marzb<U+0101>n. The prominent Islamic scholar [[Ab<U+016B> <U+1E24>an<U+012B>fa|Abu Hanifa]], whose formal name is given in Islamic sources as Nu'man ibn Thabit ibn Zuta ''ibn Marzub<U+0101>n'' ({{lang|ar|<U+0646><U+0639><U+0645><U+0627><U+0646> <U+0628><U+0646> <U+062B><U+0627><U+0628><U+062A> <U+0628><U+0646> <U+0632><U+0648><U+0637><U+0627> <U+0628><U+0646> <U+0645><U+0631><U+0632><U+0628><U+0627><U+0646>}}), was descended from the marzb<U+0101>ns of [[Kabul, Afghanistan|Kabul]], where his father came from.

==History==
The ranks tradition (primarly of ''v<U+0101>spuhr<U+0101>n'' and ''<U+0101>z<U+0101>d<U+0101>n'') can be traced to the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (550<U+2013>330 BC),{{sfn|Frye|1984|p=316}}{{sfn|Farrokh|2012|p=6}} but due to lack of sources even in the [[Parthian Empire]] (247 BC <U+2013> 224 AD) the existence of a proper classification of ranks is unknown,{{sfn|Wieseh<U+00F6>fer|2001|p=138-139}}{{sfn|Frye|1984|p=316, 224}} in comparison to the Sasanian royal inscriptions from the 3rd century AD when the aristocracy was divided into four or five ranks;{{sfn|Wieseh<U+00F6>fer|2001|p=138-139}}{{sfn|Frye|1984|p=316}} ''[[Shah|<U+0161>ahrd<U+0101>r<U+0101>n]]'' (kings, landholders), ''v<U+0101>spuhr<U+0101>n'' (princes; the [[Seven Parthian clans|seven great noble families]]{{sfn|Frye|1984|p=316}}), ''[[Wuzurgan|wuzurg<U+0101>n]]'' (magnates; "great ones"{{sfn|Frye|1984|p=316}}), smaller nobility ''[[Military of the Sasanian Empire#Azadan nobility|<U+0101>z<U+0101>d<U+0101>n]]'' (feudal nobles; freemen), and the lower bureaucracy ''dibir<U+0101>n'' (scribes).{{sfn|Frye|1984|p=316}} The Sasanian military organization was more sophisticated than the inherited Parthian system.{{sfn|Farrokh|2012|p=6}} The caste system wasn't rigid as in India, but the ruling officiers were mostly from ''wuzurg<U+0101>n'' caste.{{sfn|Frye|1984|p=316}}{{sfn|Nicolle|1996|p=10}} There's a possibility that the ''marzb<U+0101>ns'' also originated from the ''<U+0101>z<U+0101>d<U+0101>n'', which mostly were lords of villages (''dihq<U+0101>n<U+0101>n''), supplied the cavalry with young riders (''asb<U+0101>r<U+0101>n''), or were bodyguards and security forces with titles ''bandag<U+0101>n'', ''ayy<U+0101>r<U+0101>n'' or ''j<U+0101>nb<U+0101>z<U+0101>n'', all signifying association with the king.{{sfn|Zakeri|1995|p=11}}

The title ''marzb<U+0101>n'' can be dated to the Parthian Empire, where in the frontier areas such as [[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Nisa]] are found titles ''mrzwpn'' (marzban), probably an officier in charge of the frontier troops, and''dyzpty'', an officier in charge of a fort.{{sfn|Frye|1984|p=224}} Some scholars consider that ''marzb<U+0101>ns'' existed during the reign of [[Darius I]] (550<U+2013>486 BC) of the Achaemenid Empire.{{sfn|Briant|2015}} There is some uncertainty for the exact relationship between titles ''marzb<U+0101>n'', ''[[Spahbed|sp<U+0101>hbed]]'', ''[[Kanarang|kan<U+0101>rang]]'', ''p<U+0101>yg<U+014D>sb<U+0101>n'' (Parthian ''ptykwspn'', Sasanian ''paygosp<U+0101>n'' or ''padhosp<U+0101>n''{{sfn|Frye|1984|p=224}}) and ''istandar''.{{sfn|Farrokh|2012|p=8}}{{sfn|Gyselen|2004}} The historical sources blur the distinction between the ''marzb<U+0101>n'' and ''sp<U+0101>hbed'' (army general or military governor), implying ''marzb<U+0101>n'' was a military title strictly limited to the frontier marches and provinces.{{sfn|Farrokh|2012|p=8}} The least clear is the distinction with ''kan<U+0101>rang'', apparently an East-Iranian derivation of ''marzb<U+0101>n'' in the province [[Abarshahr]] in [[Central Asia]].{{sfn|Farrokh|2012|p=8}} The ''p<U+0101>yg<U+014D>sb<U+0101>n'', meaning "guardian of the district",{{sfn|Gyselen|2004}} is an uncertain title,{{sfn|Frye|1984|p=224}} seemingly provincial military commanders or governors, while the ''marzb<U+0101>n'' meant "guardian of the borders, provinces".{{sfn|Farrokh|2012|p=8}}{{sfn|Gyselen|2004}} Perhaps the ''p<U+0101>yg<U+014D>sb<U+0101>n'' lacked civilian duties.{{sfn|Nicolle|1996|p=13}} The ''istandar'' was the governor of an ''istan'' (province or district within a province).{{sfn|Farrokh|2012|p=8}}

The primary sources imply the ''marzb<U+0101>n'' was a provincional function practiced for a single or multiple provinces,<ref>{{citation |author=G. Gropp |title=Einige neuentdeckte Inschriften aus sasanidischer Zeit |publisher=W. Hinz, Altiranische Funde und Forschungen |place=[[Berlin]] |year=1969 |pages=229-262}}</ref><ref>{{citation |first=Prods O. |last=Skjaervo |author-link=Prods Oktor Skjaervo |title=The Sassanian Inscription of Paikuli III/1-2 |place=[[Wiesbaden]] |year=1983 |pages=38-39}}</ref> but there is no evidence for a "quarter of the empire", as [[Al-Masudi]] entitled [[Shahrbaraz|<U+0160>ahrwar<U+0101>z]] (629 AD).{{sfn|Gyselen|2004}} The rank of ''marzb<U+0101>n'', like most imperial administration, was mostly patrimonial, and was passed down through a single family for generations. The ''Marzb<U+0101>ns'' of greatest seniority were permitted a silver throne, while ''marzb<U+0101>ns'' of the most strategic border provinces, such as the province of Armenia, were allowed a golden throne.{{sfn|Nicolle|1996|p=10}} In military campaigns the regional ''marzb<U+0101>ns'' could be regarded as field marshals, while lesser ''sp<U+0101>hbeds'' could command a field army.{{sfn|Nicolle|1996|p=14}} 

The function of ''marzb<U+0101>n'' changed over the years, with smaller territorial units being part of the civil administration.{{sfn|Nicolle|1996|p=13}} In the early years the main ''marzb<U+0101>n'' regions were [[Persian Armenia|Armenia]], [[Beth Aramaye]] in [[Iraq]], [[Fars Province|Fars]], [[Kerman Province|Kerman]], [[Isfahan Province|Isfahan]], [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]], [[Tabaristan]], [[Nishapur County|Nishapur]], [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], and [[Sistan]] in [[Iran]], [[Bahrain]] in [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], [[Herat Province|Herat]] in [[Afghanistan]], [[Merv|Marw]] and [[Serakhs]] in [[Turkmenistan]], several mentioned belonging to the [[Greater Khorasan]].{{sfn|Nicolle|1996|p=12-13}} Some regions enjoyed considerable autonomy while other were militarily more important, for example the Azerbaijan facing the Caucaus was special military frontier.{{sfn|Nicolle|1996|p=12}}

Marzbans were granted the administration of the border provinces and were responsible for maintaining the security of the [[trade routes]], fighting the encroaching nomadic tribes such as [[Bedouin|Bedouin Arab]]s, [[White Hun]]s and [[Oghuz Turks]], and holding the first line of defense against settled enemies such as [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]].{{sfn|Nicolle|1996|p=53}} During the reign of [[Khosrau I]] (531<U+2013>579 AD) were held [[Khosrau I#Military reforms|military reforms]] by which were created four frontier regions (Khorasan, Azerbaijan, Fars, Iraq) with ''sp<U+0101>hbed'' in charge, sometimes still called as ''marzb<U+0101>n'', but now generally considered for more central provinces.{{sfn|Nicolle|1996|p=51-53}} Also, the previous gentry rank ''dihq<U+0101>n<U+0101>n'' was moulded into influentral "nobility of service" which became the backbone of the Sasanian state.{{sfn|Nicolle|1996|p=53, 55}} However, this measures of centralization caused the transfer of the power to the military (the ''dihq<U+0101>n<U+0101>n'' gradually became more independent from the government, while the four large ''sp<U+0101>hbeds'' territories quasi-independent fiefs), and led to the eventual disintegration of the Empire.{{sfn|Nicolle|1996|p=55}}

The Sasanian social, administrative and military structure and system was inherited by Medieval Islamic civilization,{{sfn|Nicolle|1996|p=13}} however, the ''marzb<U+0101>ns'' steadly disappeared depending on the region, as such in Iraq diminishd and were replaced by Muslim warriors ''muq<U+0101>tila'', while in Khorasan still had special privileges.{{sfn|Zakeri|1995|p=11, 110}} In generally were replaced by the title ''dihq<U+0101>n<U+0101>n''.{{sfn|Zakeri|1995|p=11, 110}}
