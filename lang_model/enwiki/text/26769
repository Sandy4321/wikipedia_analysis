'''John Georges "Buck" Boucher''' (August 19, 1896 <U+2013> October 17, 1960) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[professional]] [[ice hockey]] [[defenceman]] who played for the [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]], [[Montreal Maroons]], and [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] in the [[National Hockey League]]. Born in [[Ottawa, Ontario|Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Buck was one of six brothers. His brothers [[Frank Boucher|Frank]], [[Robert Boucher|Bobby]] and [[Billy Boucher|Billy]] all played in the NHL. Their father Tom Boucher, played rugby football, winning the Canadian championship in 1894, 1896, 1897 and 1901. Boucher started his professional athletic career in football as halfback for the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] of the [[Canadian Football League]]. After three years of football he switched to hockey.

==Personal life==
Georges was one of six sons born to Tom Boucher and Annie Carroll. His paternal grandfather, Antoine Boucher was French while his other grandparents were Irish in descent. His brothers [[Billy Boucher|Billy]], [[Robert Boucher|Bob]] and [[Frank Boucher|Frank]]  would also become professional ice hockey players. There were two other brothers, Carroll and Joseph, and two sisters, Irene and Lily. Their father played rugby football, winning the Canadian championship in 1894, 1896, 1897 and 1901.

Buck's son, Sgt. Frank Boucher, was the head coach of Canada's [[Ice hockey at the 1948 Winter Olympics|1948 Olympic]] gold medal winning ice hockey team - the [[Ottawa RCAF Flyers]].<ref>http://www.classicauctions.net/Default.aspx?tabid=263&auctionid=17&lotid=134</ref><ref>http://www.tsn.ca/olympics/feature/?fid=10268</ref>

==Hockey career==
He played as an amateur with the Ottawa Aberdeens and the New Edinburghs and Royal Canadians of the Ottawa City Hockey League teams. He started play with the Senators, then of the NHA, in 1915. At the time, he played as a forward.

Boucher would soon switch to play as a defenceman where he would gain fame as an excellent stick handler. He would play with stars such as [[Eddie Gerard]], [[Horrace Merrill]], [[Sprague Cleghorn]], [[Lionel Hitchman]] and [[King Clancy]].

Boucher helped lead the Senators to four [[Stanley Cup]]s between 1920 and 1927.  He played in the NHL from 1917 to 1932, scoring 117 goals and 87 recorded assists in 449 games. An extremely tough customer, he also had 838 penalty minutes, including 115 in just 44 games in 1926<U+2013>27. At his retirement in 1932 he ranked 11th among NHL career points leaders.

He would go on to coach in the NHL in Ottawa, Boston, St. Louis and Chicago. He would coach the [[Ottawa Senators (senior hockey)|Ottawa Senators]] of the [[Quebec Hockey League]] to the Allan Cup in 1949.

He suffered from [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]] for six years and was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1960, just three weeks before he died.
