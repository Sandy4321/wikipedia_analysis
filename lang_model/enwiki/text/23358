"'''Because You Left'''" is the television [[season premiere]] of the [[American Broadcasting Company]]'s [[Lost (season 5)|fifth season]] of the [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]] [[Dramatic programming|drama]] [[Television program|television series]] ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''. The episode is the 87th episode of the show overall, and was written by [[executive producers]]/[[show runner]]s [[Damon Lindelof]] and [[Carlton Cuse]] and directed by co-executive producer [[Stephen Williams (director)|Stephen Wiliams]].  It first aired on January 21, 2009 on ABC in the United States and was [[simulcast]] on [[A (TV system)|A]] in Canada. It aired immediately after a [[clip-show]] that recaps the first four seasons and aired back-to-back with the next episode, "[[The Lie (Lost)|The Lie]]".

In 2007, [[Jack Shephard]] and [[Benjamin Linus]] start their quest to reunite the "Oceanic 6". [[Hugo "Hurley" Reyes]] and [[Sayid Jarrah]] are ambushed at their safehouse. [[Sun-Hwa Kwon]] is confronted by [[Charles Widmore]]. [[Kate Austen]] and [[Characters_of_Lost#Aaron|Aaron Littleton]] flee from their home after being ordered to submit a maternity test. At the island, [[James "Sawyer" Ford]], [[Daniel Faraday]], [[Juliet Burke]], [[Charlotte Lewis (Lost)|Charlotte Lewis]], [[Miles Straume]], [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]] and the other survivors of Oceanic 815 left on the island erratically jump through time upon the island's move. "Because You Left" averaged 11.347 million viewers in the United States, and received good reviews, praising the writing and the unraveling of new elements.

==Plot==
The episode begins in the late 1970s, when the [[Dharma Initiative]] has begun to build stations on the island. [[Characters of Lost#Island inhabitants and arrivals|Dr. Pierre Chang]] ([[Fran<U+00E7>ois Chau]])<!-- DO NOT add whom he identifies himself as. It is not needed in this particular episode summary. --> begins to film the orientation film for the [[Dharma Initiative#Station 2: The Arrow|Arrow Station]], when he is informed of an incident at the construction site of the [[Dharma Initiative#Station 6: The Orchid|Orchid Station]]. Upon arriving there, he realizes that the workers have found the "unlimited" energy source that the Dharma Initiative has been looking for, which will enable them to manipulate time. As he leaves the station, he bumps into [[Daniel Faraday]] ([[Jeremy Davies (actor)|Jeremy Davies]]), who is dressed as a Dharma construction worker.

On December 30, 2004, following the island being moved in "[[There's No Place Like Home]]", the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815, the freighter team, and [[Juliet Burke]] ([[Elizabeth Mitchell]]) begin to erratically jump through time, while the [[Others (Lost)|Others]] are unaffected. The first jump takes them to the day when the [[Deus Ex Machina (Lost)|Beechcraft]] carrying [[Mr. Eko]]'s brother crashes onto the island. [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]] is shot in the leg by [[Ethan Rom]] ([[William Mapother]]), who has not yet met him and therefore does not recognize him. Meanwhile, [[James "Sawyer" Ford]] ([[Josh Holloway]]), Juliet and the freighter team head to the [[Dharma Initiative#Station 3: The Swan|Swan Station]] in order to determine when they are. A second jump brings the group forward in time to after the destruction of the station, saving Locke from Ethan in the process. When pressed for an explanation by Sawyer, Daniel Faraday likens the experience to a record skipping. Locke is approached by [[Richard Alpert (Lost)|Richard Alpert]] ([[Nestor Carbonell]]), who recognizes Locke and treats his wound. He informs Locke that they will be strangers at their next meeting, and thus gives him a compass to get his younger self to trust Locke. He explains that the only way to stop the erratic movements through time is to bring back everyone who has left the island, and to do that Locke will have to die. At the Swan station, which is now intact, Sawyer tries to contact [[Desmond Hume]] ([[Henry Ian Cusick]]), who is inside. Daniel asserts that the past can not be changed, and since Desmond didn't know Sawyer already when they first met (later in Desmond's timeline), Sawyer cannot be successful. No one answers, and everyone heads back to the beach. Daniel stays behind and knocks again, and Desmond emerges dressed in a [[hazmat suit]], thus belying Daniel's original assertion. Daniel tells him that if Desmond's future self and the survivors of 815 make it off the island on the helicopter then he should go to [[Oxford University]] and find Daniel's mother, in order to help the survivors. Another jump occurs just before Daniel can give his mother's name.

In 2007, back in Los Angeles, two lawyers visit [[Kate Austen]] ([[Evangeline Lilly]]). They deliver a court order for a maternity test for her and [[Characters of Lost#Aaron Littleton|Aaron]], [[Claire Littleton]]'s ([[Emilie de Ravin]]) son, whom Kate is raising as her own, but refuse to reveal their client's identity. In [[London]] while en route to [[Los Angeles]], [[Sun-Hwa Kwon]] ([[Yunjin Kim]]) is confronted by [[Charles Widmore]] ([[Alan Dale]]) at the airport. She tells him that she wants to kill [[Benjamin Linus]] ([[Michael Emerson]]), a desire they seem to have in common. Following [[Hugo "Hurley" Reyes]]'s ([[Jorge Garcia]]) breakout of a mental institution, he and [[Sayid Jarrah]] ([[Naveen Andrews]]) go to a safehouse, which has been infiltrated by two armed men. Sayid kills the men, but not before one of them shoots him with two potent drugged darts, knocking him unconscious.   Meanwhile, Ben and [[Jack Shephard]] ([[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]]) have left the funeral parlor with Locke's body. They discover that Hurley has broken out, hindering Ben's plan to reunite the [[There's No Place Like Home#Part 2|Oceanic Six]]. On a boat in an unknown location, Desmond wakes up, having remembered what Daniel told him, and sets off for Oxford.

Reviews were positive. James Poniewozik of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' thought that "Because You Left" provided a good balance of characterization and mythology and commended the character of Faraday, partially "because a perfectly-cast Jeremy Davies has turned him into a likeable, flawed, brusque, slightly-in-over-his-head nebbish-god."<ref>Poniewozik, James, (January 21, 2009) "[http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2009/01/21/lost-watch-you-cant-make-a-record-if-you-cant-make-a-record-if-you-cant Lostwatch: You Can't Make a Record If, You Can't Make a Record If, You Can't<U+2026>]", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.

She concluded that the premiere is "quite good" (three and a half out of four stars) with "a lot to like", specifically the expanded screen time for Faraday; however, Ryan expressed difficulty in understanding the use of time (travel) in the show and felt that one to two more viewings were warranted for her to give a better review of that aspect.<ref>Ryan, Maureen, (December 30, 2008) "[http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2008/12/lost-abc-sawy-1.html Time Bandits: The Season Premiere of ''Lost'' (Just a Few Thoughts and Links)]", ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]''.
