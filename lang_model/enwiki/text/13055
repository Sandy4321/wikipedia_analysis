The '''Blackwall Tunnel''' is a pair of road [[tunnel]]s underneath the [[River Thames]] in east [[London]], [[England]] linking the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] with the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich]], and part of the [[A102 road]]. The northern portal lies just south of the East India Dock Road ([[A13 road (England)|A13]]) in [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]];{{Ref|A|A}} the southern entrances are just south of [[The O2 (London)|The O<sub>2</sub>]] on the [[Greenwich Peninsula]].{{Ref|B|B}} The road is managed by [[Transport for London]] (TfL).

The tunnel was originally opened as a single bore in 1897 by the then [[Prince of Wales]], as a major transport project to improve commerce and trade in London's [[East End]], and supported a mix of foot, cycle, horse-drawn and vehicular traffic. By the 1930s, capacity was becoming inadequate, and consequently a second bore opened in 1967, handling southbound traffic while the earlier 19th century tunnel handled northbound.

The northern approach takes traffic from the [[A12 road (England)|A12]] and the southern approach takes traffic from the [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]], making the tunnel crossing a key link for both local and longer-distance traffic between the north and south sides of the river. It forms part of a key route into [[Central London]] from [[South East (London sub region)|South East London]] and [[Kent]] and was the easternmost all-day crossing for vehicles before the opening of the [[Dartford Crossing|Dartford Tunnel]] in 1963. It remains the easternmost free fixed road crossing of the Thames, and regularly suffers congestion, to the extent that tidal flow schemes were in place from 1978 until controversially removed in 2007. Proposals to solve the traffic problems have included building a third bore, constructing alternative crossings of the Thames such as the now cancelled [[Thames Gateway Bridge]] or the [[Silvertown Link]], and providing better traffic management, particularly for heavy goods vehicles.

The tunnels are no longer open to pedestrians, cyclists or other non-motorised traffic,<ref name="pedban"/> and the northbound tunnel has a {{convert|4.0|m|ft|adj=on}} height limit. One bus route runs through the tunnels.

==History==
===Old tunnel===
[[File:Section of the Blackwall Tunnel.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A framing section of the Blackwall Tunnel being constructed at the Thames Ironworks around 1895.]]
A tunnel in the Blackwall area was originally proposed in the 1880s. According to Robert Webster, then MP for St Pancras East, a tunnel would "be very useful to the East End of London, a district representing in trade and commerce a population greater than the combined populations of Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham."<ref name="webster1887">{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1887/aug/08/committee#S3V0318P0_18870808_HOC_414|title=Commons Sitting - Committee|publisher=[[Hansard]]|date=8 August 1887|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> By this time, all road bridges in London east of the ferry at [[Chiswick]] were toll-free, but these were of little use to the two fifths of London's population that lived to the east of [[London Bridge]]. The Thames Tunnel (Blackwall) Act was created in August 1887, which provided the legal framework necessary to construct the tunnel.<ref name="britishhistory"/><ref name="webster1887"/> The initial proposal, made by [[Sir Joseph Bazalgette]], called for three parallel tunnels, two for vehicular traffic and one for foot,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Blackwall Tunnel|journal=Scientific American: Supplement|volume=44|publisher=Munn and Company|date=1897}}</ref> with an expected completion date of works within seven years. It was originally commissioned by the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] but, just before the contract was due to start, responsibility passed to the [[London County Council]] (LCC) when the former body was abolished in 1889 and Bazalgette's work on the tunnel ended.<ref name="smith"/>

===New tunnel===
[[Image:Blackwall tunnel towers 1.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The northern ventilation towers for the new Blackwall tunnel. (February 2006)]]
Due to the increasing popularity in motor traffic in the early 20th century, the capacity of the original tunnel was soon perceived as inadequate. In 1930, John Mills, MP for [[Dartford (UK Parliament constituency)|Dartford]], remarked that [[heavy goods vehicle|HGV]]s delivering from [[Essex]] to [[Kent]] could not practically use any crossing of the Thames downstream of the tunnel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1930/mar/10/dartford-and-purfleet-thames-tunnel-bill#S5CV0236P0_19300310_HOC_403|title=Dartford and Purfleet Thames Tunnel Bill|date=10 March 1930|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> The LCC obtained an act to construct a new tunnel in 1938, but work did not start due to the outbreak of [[World War II]] and did not resume until 1958, when preliminary work on the northern approach road started.<ref name="smith"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1957/may/15/blackwall-tunnel#S5CV0570P0_19570515_CWA_37|title=Blackwall Tunnel|publisher=[[Hansard]]|date=15 May 1957|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> By this time, traffic had got progressively worse. In 1960, [[Richard Marsh, Baron Marsh|Richard Marsh]], MP for [[Greenwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Greenwich]] complained that traffic could spend 30 to 45 minutes stuck in tunnel traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1960/apr/29/road-safety-bill#S5CV0622P0_19600429_HOC_103|title=Road Safety Bill|publisher=[[Hansard]]|author=[[Richard Marsh, Baron Marsh|Richard Marsh]]|date=29 April 1960|accessdate=28 June 2013}}</ref>

The new eastern tunnel itself, {{convert|28|ft|2|in|m|disp=flip}} in diameter, was accepted into the roads programme in March 1959, and construction started in March 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1966/nov/22/blackwall-tunnel#S5CV0736P0_19661122_CWA_168|title=Blackwall Tunnel|author=[[Stephen Swingler]]|date=22 November 1966|publisher=[[Hansard]]|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> It was opened on 2 August 1967 by [[Desmond Plummer]], Leader of the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC).<ref name=Autocar196708>{{cite journal| authorlink = Maurice Smith (Ed)|title = News and Views| journal = [[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume =  127 (nbr 3730)| pages = page 50|date = date 10 August 1967 }}</ref> It was wider and usable by vehicles up to {{convert|4.72|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

In contrast with the Victorian northbound tunnel, the eastern tunnel had no sharp bends and emergency telephones were provided. Its distinctive ventilation towers were designed in 1964 by GLC architect [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]].<ref name="urbandesign"/><ref name="smith"/>

In the late 1960s, proposals were made to connect the tunnel with a free-flow, grade separated motorway system as part of the [[London Ringways]] project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1969/jul/23/motorways-eltham#S5CV0787P0_19690723_HOC_601|title=Motorways (Eltham)|date=23 July 1969|publisher=[[Hansard]]|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> Aside from the construction of the A102(M) Blackwall Tunnel approach roads, opened in 1973,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1973/dec/20/motorways#S5CV0866P0_19731220_CWA_288|title=Motorways|author=John Peyton|date=20 December 1973|publisher=[[Hansard]]|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ciht.org.uk/motorway/a102mbtapp.htm|title=A102(M).

===Provisional IRA bombing===
On 18 January 1979, an anonymous caller to the [[Press Association]] informed them that the [[Provisional IRA]] had planted a bomb in the tunnel that was scheduled to detonate at midnight. While the [[Metropolitan Police]] were searching the tunnel, the bomb detonated at 12:40am, causing an explosion in a gasholder near the southern exit. This resulted in a fire on another gasholder approximately an hour later. No injuries were reported. Home secretary [[Merlyn Rees]] hoped "the House will join me in condeming these attacks and will support the Government in their determination not to be swayed by such methods."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1979/jan/18/bomb-incidents#S5CV0960P0_19790118_HOC_278|title=Bomb Incidents|date=18 January 1979|publisher=[[Hansard]]|author=[[Merlyn Rees]]|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1979/jan/18/bomb-incidents#S5LV0397P0_19790118_HOL_217|title=Bomb Incidents|date=18 January 1979|author=Terence Boston, Lord Boston of Faversham|publisher=[[Hansard]]|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> A Belfast man was subsequently jailed for 17 years in May 1983 for his role in the bombing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19830527&id=psRAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9qUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3979,5587070|title=IRA bomber jailed for 17 years|publisher=[[Glasgow Herald]]|date=27 May 1983|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref>

==Nearest alternative crossings==
The nearest alternative road crossings are the [[Rotherhithe Tunnel]] {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on|0}} to the west, [[Tower Bridge]] {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|0}} to the west, and the [[Dartford Crossing]] {{convert|16|mi|km|abbr=on|0}} to the east. The [[Woolwich Free Ferry]] is {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on|0}} to the east, but is closed overnight, often reduced to one boat in operation, or completely closed at weekends, and cannot be relied upon as an alternative road crossing.

Underground railway links include the [[Jubilee line]] from [[North Greenwich tube station|North Greenwich]] (TfL) to [[Canning Town station|Canning Town]] on the east and [[Canary Wharf tube station|Canary Wharf]] on the west. The [[Docklands Light Railway]] also passes under the Thames between [[Island Gardens DLR station|Island Gardens]] at the southern end of the [[Isle of Dogs]] and [[Cutty Sark DLR station|Cutty Sark]] in the centre of [[Greenwich]].

Horse-drawn traffic was partially banned from the tunnel during peak hours in July 1939<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1939/jul/05/blackwall-tunnel-traffic-delays#S5CV0349P0_19390705_CWA_118|title=Blackwall Tunnel (Traffic Delays)|publisher=[[Hansard]]|date=5 July 1939|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> and completely banned in August 1947.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/38037/pages/3683|title=London Traffic Act 1924|publisher=[[London Gazette]]|date=1 August 1947|accessdate=28 June 2013}}</ref> Pedestrians have been banned from using the Blackwall Tunnels since May 1969,<ref name=pedban>{{citation|date=23 May 1969|title=East London Advertiser|page=5}}</ref> but pedestrians and cyclists may also use the foot tunnels at [[Greenwich foot tunnel|Greenwich]] (close to Island Gardens and Cutty Sark stations) and [[Woolwich foot tunnel|Woolwich]] (close to the Woolwich Ferry).

The northbound Blackwall Tunnel is a traffic [[Bottleneck#Traffic|bottleneck]] with [[Traffic congestion|tailback]]s.<ref name="bbc20070419">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6570775.stm |title=Tidal flow system ends in tunnel |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-04-19 |accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref> A TfL study in 2009 revealed that the {{convert|1.7|km|miles|disp=flip|adj=on}} approach to the northbound tunnel took around 19 minutes in rush hour traffic, or a delay of approximately 11 minutes per kilometre.<ref name="tfl20090708">{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/Item06-EastLondonRiverCrossings.pdf|title=Update on East London Crossings Review|publisher=[[Transport for London]]|page=2|date=8 July 2009|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> To relieve the congestion, a [[Reversible lane|tidal flow]] system was introduced in 1978, allowing northbound traffic to use the eastern tunnel.<ref name="bbc20070419"/> The congestion is not limited to weekday rush hours. There is often congestion with tailbacks at the weekends, especially on Sunday evenings.
Due to its sharp turns with restricted headroom, high-sided vehicles can only use the left-hand lane of the western tunnel, so it was not possible to reverse the tidal flow in the evening. On 20 April 2007 the morning tidal flow was discontinued, after reports by TfL and the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] (MPS) of an increase in dangerous motoring behaviour; these blamed poor driving, such as overtaking, for the decrease in safety during counterflow operations.<ref name="bbc20070419" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/4919.aspx TfL news |title=Transport at a glance |publisher=Transport for London |date=2007-04-19 |accessdate=2007-11-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930184316/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/4919.aspx <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}</ref> The decision to end the counterflow was controversial, particularly as TfL and the MPS had been considering it since 2005, without properly informing affected borough councils, and an indepedent committee was set up to evaluate the decision.<ref name="latc">{{cite web|url=http://legacy.london.gov.uk/assembly/reports/transport/blackwall-tunnel-rpt.pdf|title=The London Assembly Transport Committee's review of the decision to end the peak hours tidal flow in the Blackwall tunnel|publisher=[[Transport for London]]|page=13|date=July 2007|accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref> The ending of the counterflow system has brought protests from users of the tunnel and those experiencing increased congestion due to the change.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6637817.stm |title=Calls for tunnel lane to reopen |date=2007-05-09 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref>

In November 2007, the [[Mayor of London]], [[Ken Livingstone]] responded to complaints from Greenwich Council about congestion in the area, with the possibility of setting up a small [[London congestion charge|congestion charging zone]].

In 2010, the southbound tunnel was affected by planned closures for maintenance from 10 pm to 5 am, Thursday to Sunday inclusive,<ref name="bbc2010205">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8500000/8500274.stm|title=Blackwall Tunnel disruption until December 2012|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=5 February 2010|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> and over a number of whole weekends.<ref name=closures/> The tunnel was only closed six full weekends instead of the planned ten,<ref name="nce"/> but it is still being regularly closed to traffic for maintenance as of March 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/roadusers/Weekly_tunnel_maintenance_closure_schedule_6Mar13.pdf|title=Weekly tunnel maintenance closure schedule|publisher=[[Transport for London]]|date=6 March 2013|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> 

The tunnel also suffers regular problems with strikes from over-height traffic, and vehicles running out of fuel.<ref name="tfl20110204"/> On 10 December 1996, a man drove a Mercedes truck supporting a crane towards the southbound tunnel, ignored warnings that his vehicle was over-height, and struck a gantry, breaking a steel reinforcement frame in the process. The entire tunnel was immediately closed, not only to retrieve the vehicle, but perform additional safety checks. Because the [[Limehouse Link tunnel]], which runs near to the north end of the Blackwall Tunnel, and the [[Queen Elizabeth II Bridge]], part of the Dartford Crossing, were also closed on the same day, the accident caused one of the worst traffic jams in the capital.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=705nF7ZUklkC&pg=PT289&dq=blackwall+tunnel&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_j_VUfDFJ9Ka0AXN-oHABw&ved=0CDIQuwUwADgU|page=302|title=Autopia: Cars and Culture|last=Woollen|first=Peter|last2=Kerr|first2=Joe|publisher=Reaktion books|year=2002|isbn=978-1-86189-132-7}}</ref> In February 2011, TfL reported that the tunnel had been closed 1,200 times in the previous year for a total of 157 hours,<ref name="tfl20110204"/> while ''New Civil Engineer'' magazine claimed it shut 1,448 times in 2010.<ref name="nce">{{cite web|url=http://www.nce.co.uk/news/transport/blackwall-tunnel-upgrade-set-for-early-completion/8622119.article|title=Blackwall Tunnel upgrade set for early completion|date=4 November 2011|publisher=New Civil Engineer|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> To try and prevent closures of this nature, an LED noticeboard was set up in the northbound approach, counting the number of breakdowns and accidents per month occurring inside the tunnel.<ref name="tfl20110204">{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/static/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/18143.html|title=TfL urges drivers to 'check before they travel' through the Blackwall Tunnel|publisher=[[Transport for London]]|date=04 February 2011|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref>

==Future==
[[File:Blackwall Tunnel Third Bore Map.jpg|thumb|left|An option to construct a third bore of the tunnel was proposed in the 1990s, and was depicted in some maps.]]
The continual congestion and requirements for closures and refurbishments are unlikely to change, as the Blackwall Tunnel remains the only major road crossing of the Thames in east London for the short-term future. The proposed [[Thames Gateway Bridge]], a new crossing between the Woolwich Ferry and the Dartford Crossing, was cancelled by [[Boris Johnson]] when he replaced Livingstone as mayor in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/nov/06/travelandtransport-carbonemissions|title=Boris scraps new Bridge|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 November 2008|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> 

A third bore of the tunnel, replacing the old Victorian northbound bore, was proposed by Transport Secretary [[Cecil Parkinson]] in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1989/dec/14/traffic-london|publisher=[[Hansard]]|author=[[Cecil Parkinson]]|title=Traffic (London)|date=14 December 1989}}</ref> but had yet to see any progress towards construction over a decade later.<ref>{{cite book|title=Jubilee Line Extension: From Concept to Completion|last=Mitchell|first=Bob|publisher=Thomas Telford|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7277-3028-2|page=60}}</ref> This option is not currently favoured by TfL due to technical problems with construction and engineering, difficulty tying in with the existing road network, and concern about increased traffic on the A12.<ref name="tfl20090708"/>

Other schemes proposed by TfL that would allow tunnel traffic to cross the Thames elsewhere are the [[Silvertown Tunnel]] between [[Silvertown]] and the [[Greenwich Peninsula]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/rivercrossings/cc90b4dd|title=The Silvertown Tunnel (a road tunnel between the Greenwich Peninsula and Silvertown)|publisher=[[Transport for London]]|date=1 February 2013|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> and the [[Gallions Reach Ferry]] between [[Beckton]] and [[Thamesmead]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/rivercrossings/4763e746|title=The Gallions Reach Ferry (a ferry between Thamesmead and Beckton)|date=1 February 2013|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref>
