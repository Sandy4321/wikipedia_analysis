'''Christopher M. Bell''' (1974-December 25, 2009) was a [[disability studies]] scholar working in the area of [[HIV/AIDS]], race and ethnicity. He was the former president of the [[Society for Disability Studies]] and contributed to national discussions about race, ethnicity and disability studies. His posthumously published anthology, ''Blackness and Disability: Critical Examinations and Cultural Interventions'', grew from his early critique of disability studies as a "white discipline" that ignored the racial dimensions of studying disability.<ref>Bell, Christopher M.
