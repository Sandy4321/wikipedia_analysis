==Historical droughts==
[[File:Canal San Carlos.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[San Carlos Canal]] in picture begun to be built in 1772 in response to years of drought.]]

===Drought of 1770<U+2013>1782===
The 1770<U+2013>1782 period was one of general drought in Central Chile with a total of three non-consecutive years of extreme drought.<ref name=astaburuaga/> In 1772 vineyards and cropfields along [[Mapocho River]] in Santiago could not be irrigated.<ref name=Urru67-68>Urrutia & Lanza 1993, pp. 67-68.</ref> This drought led the authorities to begin the construction of the long-planned [[San Carlos Canal]] in 1772 to deviate waters from [[Maipo River]] to Mapocho River.<ref name=Urru67-68/>

===Drought of 1924===
In 1924 a drought spread between [[Coquimbo Region|Coquimbo]] and [[Maule Region]].<ref name=Urru201-203>Urrutia & Lanza 1993, pp. 201-203.</ref> In [[Coquimbo Region]] (at the time known as ''Province of Coquimbo'') 70% of the wheat from non-irrigated land was lost while in irrigated areas the harvest loss was of 20%.<ref name=Urru201-203/> The price of railroad transport of livestock to places south of [[Curic<U+00F3>]] was lowered by 40% as there was hardly any grass or plant buds for livestock to eat in [[Norte Chico, Chile|Norte Chico]].<ref name=Urru201-203/>

Rural people in Coquimbo Region flocked around the towns of [[Illapel]], [[Combarbal<U+00E1>]] and [[Ovalle]].<ref name=Urru67-68/> Later the intendant of Coquimbo claimed that about hundred people had left the province as result of the drought.<ref name=Urru201-203/>

===Great Drought of 1968<U+2013>1969===
The drought faced by Chile between 1968 and 1969, known as the Great Drought of 1968, was one of the largest rainfall deficits in the country during the twentieth century, only comparable to the drought of 1924.<ref>{{citation|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0002/000227/022757so.pdf|author=Esp<U+00ED>ldora, Basilio|title=Algunos antecedentes hidrol<U+00F3>gicos de la sequ<U+00ED>a en Chile|work=Acta del Seminario Regional sobre Hidrolog<U+00ED>a de Sequ<U+00ED>as|year=1972|pages=181<U+2013>184|accessdate=2011-02-14}}</ref> The drought had its origin in the low amounts of precipitation the fell in 1967.<ref name=Urru337-340>Urrutia & Lanza 1993, pp. 337-340.</ref> The area affected by the drought spanned from [[Atacama Region]] in the north to [[<U+00D1>uble Province]] in the south.<ref name=eugenio>{{Citation

The drought created huge losses for cultivations of potato, rice, maize, beans. Fruit trees and vineyards were also affected.<ref name=Urru337-340/> 100 thousand cattle and 1 million sheep died because of the drought. Milk, meat and wool output declined.<ref name=Urru337-340/> By September 1969 only 250 thousand goats remained from an earlier population of 650.000.<ref name=Urru337-340/>

Through rural [[Norte Chico, Chile|Norte Chico]] many farmers and communities came to lack water even for human consumption.<ref name=Urru337-340/> In 1969 farmers received support of several financial institutions and state agencies including tax exemptions and a [[line of credit]] to buy [[forage]].<ref name=Urru337-340/>

In Central the typical river flow increase in December did not happen in 1968.<ref name=eugenio/> Chile many farmers decided to not cultivate in early summer due to this and the known fact there was almost no snow in Andes.<ref name=eugenio/> Later in summer the rivers did grew due to [[glacier]] [[ablation]] a causing many farmers to repent albeit it was too late to cultivate.<ref name=eugenio/>

The decline in hydroelectrical power generation (The hydroelectrical deficit was of 200 [[gigawatt|GW]]) was partly compensated by having the thermoelectrical plants of [[Ventanas Power Plant|Ventanas]], Renca and Laguna Verda function at maximum capacity.<ref name=Urru337-340/> To supply the thermoelectrical plants with coal the production and stock of [[Lota-Schwager]] was not enough and government authorized the import of 50 thousand tons of coal from the [[United States]], [[Poland]], [[France]] and [[Germany]].<ref name=Urru337-340/>

In the [[hydrological year]] of 1969<U+2013>1970 the area affected by the drought disminished from previously spanning the latitudes of 27<U+2013>37<U+00B0> S to 27<U+2013>33<U+00B0> S.<ref name=eugenio/>

===Drought of 1998<U+2013>1999===
Beginning in December 1996 the [[El Ni<U+00F1>o]] phenomemnon affected Chile during 14 months until 1998.<ref name=Puentes>{{Citation
