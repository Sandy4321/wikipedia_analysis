{{Otheruses4|the clock escapement mechanism|other uses|Verge (disambiguation)}}

The '''verge''' (or '''crown wheel''') '''escapement''' is the earliest known type of [[escapement]]; the mechanism in a mechanical [[clock]] that controls its rate by advancing the gear train at regular intervals or 'ticks'.  Its origin is unknown.  Verge escapements were used from the 14th century until about 1800 in clocks and [[pocketwatch]]es.

Its invention is important in the [[history of technology]], because it made possible the development of all-mechanical clocks.  This caused a shift from measuring time by [[Continuous function|continuous]] processes, such as the flow of liquid in [[water clocks]], to repetitive, [[oscillatory]] processes, such as the swing of [[pendulum]]s, which had the potential to be more accurate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Marrison|first=Warren|title=The Evolution of the Quartz Crystal Clock|journal=Bell System Technical Journal|date=1948|volume=27|pages=510-588|url=http://www.ieee-uffc.org/freqcontrol/marrison/Marrison.html|accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref><ref name="Cipolla2004">{{cite book|last=Cipolla|first=Carlo M.|title=Clocks and Culture, 1300 to 1700|date=2004|publisher=W.W.

In China, escapements were employed in a water-powered celestial globe built by [[Yi Xing]] in 725 CE and [[Su Song]]'s astronomical clock-tower in 1088.  These were not true mechanical escapements, since the time was still measured by flowing water<ref>{{cite book|last=Whitrow|first=J.

The first hard evidence of the verge escapement dates from 14th century Europe, where its invention led to the development of the first all-mechanical clocks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Escapement|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica online|date=2007|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9032979/escapement#5666.hook|accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref><ref>White 1966, p.119</ref><ref name="Cipolla2004"/>  Starting in the 1200s, large tower clocks began appearing in town squares and cathedrals.  They kept time by using the verge escapement to drive a horizontal bar with weights on the ends called the '''foliot''', a primitive type of [[balance wheel]], to oscillate back and forth.  The rate of the clock could be adjusted by sliding the weights in or out on the foliot bar.  

There is speculation that [[Villard de Honnecourt]] invented the verge escapement in 1237 with an illustration of a questionable device.<ref>{{cite web|title=Machines: Saw, Trap, Hoist, and Automata|work=Bib.

The name verge comes from the Latin ''virga'', stick or rod.

[[Image:Early_Pendulum_Clock_Christian_Huygens.jpg|thumb|One of the first verge pendulum clocks built by Christian Huygens, inventor of the pendulum. From ''Opera Varia'',vol.1 1724.  In a pendulum clock, the verge escapement is turned 90 degrees so that the crown wheel faces up (top).]]

==Verge pendulum clocks==
Most of the gross inaccuracy of verge and foliot clocks was not due to the escapement itself, but to the foliot oscillator.  The invention of the [[pendulum]] around 1656 suddenly increased the accuracy of the verge clock from hours a day to minutes a day .  Most clocks were rebuilt with their foliots replaced by pendulums,<ref>{{cite web | title=Big Clocks | publisher=Science Museum, UK | date=2007 | url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/the_wells_cathedral_clock.aspx?page=2 | accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref><ref>Milham 1945, p.144</ref> to the extent that it is difficult to find original verge and foliot clocks intact today.  A similar increase in accuracy in verge [[watches]] followed the introduction of the [[balance spring]] in 1658.

==How it works==
The verge escapement consists of a wheel shaped like a crown, with sawtooth-shaped teeth protruding axially to the front.  In front of it is a vertical rod, the verge, with two metal plates, the pallets, that engage the teeth at opposite sides of the crown wheel.  The balance wheel (or the pendulum) is attached to the verge.  The pallets are positioned so only one catches the teeth at a time.  As the clock<U+2019>s gears turn the crown wheel, it pushes the first pallet, rotating the verge in one direction, and rotating the second pallet into the path of the teeth, until the tooth pushes past the first pallet.  Then a tooth on the wheel<U+2019>s opposite side catches the second pallet, rotating the verge back the other direction, and the cycle repeats.  The result is to change the rotary motion of the wheel to an oscillating motion of the verge.  Each stroke of the foliot or pendulum thus advances the wheel train of the clock, moving the hands forward at a constant rate. 

The crown wheel must have an odd number of teeth for the escapement to function.  The usual angle between the pallets was 90<U+00B0> to 105<U+00B0>, resulting in a foliot or pendulum swing of around 80<U+00B0> to 100<U+00B0>.  The French used larger pallet angles, upwards of 115<U+00B0>,  which reduced recoil (below), but required the verge to be located so near the crown wheel that the teeth fell on the pallets very near the axis, reducing initial leverage and increasing friction, thus requiring lighter balance wheels.<ref>{{cite book|last=Britten|first=Frederick J.|title=The Watch and Clock Maker's Handbook, 9th Ed.|date=1896|publisher=E.F. & N. Spon|location=London|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5SYJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA392}}, p.391-392</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Glasgow | first=David | title=Watch and Clock Making | date=1885 | publisher=Cassel & Co. |location=London| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9wUFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA124}}, p.124-126</ref>

==Disadvantages==
As might be expected from its early invention, the verge is the most inaccurate of the widely-used escapements.  It suffers from these problems: 
* Verge clocks are sensitive to changes in the drive force; they slow down as the [[mainspring]] unwinds.  This is called lack of [[Isochronous|isochronism]].  It was much worse in verge and foliot clocks due to the lack of a balance spring, but is a problem in all verge movements.  In fact, the common method of adjusting the rate of early verge watches was to alter the force of the mainspring.<ref>{{cite web | last=Perez | first=Carlos | date=2001 | title=Artifacts of the Golden Age, part 1 |work=Carlos's Journal | publisher=TimeZone | url=http://www.timezone.com/library/cjrml/cjrml0006 | accessdate=2007-06-06}}.  Narrative history of watches, by antique watch aficionado, on watch collector's website.</ref>  The cause of this problem is that the verge is a ''frictional'' type escapement.  The crown wheel teeth are always pushing on the pallets, driving the pendulum (or balance wheel) throughout its cycle; it is never allowed to swing freely.   All later verge watches and some clocks had [[Fusee (part of clock)|fusee]]s to equalize the force of the mainspring.  
* It is a ''recoil'' type escapement, meaning that the force of the pendulum causes the wheel train to move backward during part of its cycle.  This increases friction and wear, resulting in inaccuracy.  One way to tell whether a watch has a verge escapement is to observe the second hand closely; if it moves backward a little during each beat, the watch is a verge.
* In pendulum clocks, the wide pendulum swing angles of 80<U+00B0>-100<U+00B0> required by the verge cause an additional lack of isochronism due to [[Pendulum|circular error]].
* Wide pendulum swings also require a lot of power to keep it going, increasing wear.<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/mvhw/anchor.html Headrick 2002]</ref>  So verge pendulum clocks had lighter bobs, which reduced accuracy.

==Decline==
Verge escapements were used in virtually all clocks and [[watches]] for 400 years.  Then the increase in accuracy due to the introduction of the pendulum and balance spring in the mid 1600s focused attention on error caused by the escapement.  In the 17th and 18th century wave of horological innovation that followed, the verge was superseded by better escapements.  

In pendulum clocks, it was replaced by the [[anchor escapement]], invented in 1671.  By locating the pallets farther from the axis of rotation, the anchor escapement reduced the pendulum swing from around 100<U+00B0> in verge clocks to 4<U+00B0>-6<U+00B0>.  In addition to eliminating circular error, this allowed room in the clock case for longer and slower pendulums, reducing wear.<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/mvhw/anchor.html Headrick 2002], pp.21</ref>  In England the anchor escapement took over, but the French continued to use verge escapements until about 1800.  Many verge clocks were rebuilt with anchor escapements.

In [[pocketwatch]]es, besides its inaccuracy, the vertical orientation of the crown wheel and the need for a bulky [[Fusee (part of clock)|fusee]] made the verge movement unfashionably thick.  French watchmakers adopted the thinner [[Escapement#Cylinder escapement|cylinder escapement]], invented in 1695.  In England, high end watches went to the [[Escapement#Duplex escapement|duplex escapement]], developed in 1782, but inexpensive verge fusee watches continued to be produced until the early 1800s, when the [[lever escapement]] took over.<ref>[http://www.timezone.com/library/cjrml/cjrml0006  Perez 2001], pp.8</ref><ref>[http://www.secondtimeround.com/history.html#1600 Second Time Around 2007]</ref> 

Although the verge is not known for accuracy, it is capable of it.  The first successful [[marine chronometer]]s, H4 and H5, made by [[John Harrison]] in 1759 and 1770, used verge escapements with ruby pallets.<ref>[http://www.timezone.com/library/cjrml/cjrml0006  Perez 2001], pp.11</ref><ref>[http://www.geocities.com/mvhw/anchor.html Headrick 2002], pp.2</ref>  In trials they were accurate to within a fifth of a second per day.<ref>{{cite web | date=2002 | title=A Walk Through Time, part 3: A Revolution in Timekeeping | publisher=NIST | url=http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/revol.html | accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref>

Today the verge is seen only in antique timepieces.  Many original bracket clocks have their Victorian-era anchor escapement conversions undone and the original style of verge escapement restored.  Clockmakers call this a ''verge reconversion''.
