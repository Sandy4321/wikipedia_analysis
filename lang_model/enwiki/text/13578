'''''Melica patagonica''''' is a species of [[grass]] in the [[Poaceae]] family that is endemic to [[South America]].<ref name=kew>{{cite web|url= http://www.kew.org/data/grasses-db/www/imp06170.htm|author=W.D.

==Description==
The species is [[perennial plant|perennial]], caespitose and clumped while [[culm (plant)|culms]] are decumbent and are {{convert|20|<U+2013>|40|cm}} long. The leaf-sheaths are scabrous, tubular, are closed on one end and are [[glabrousness|glabrous]] on surface. The leaf-blades are convolute, filiform, and are {{convert|4|-|6|mm}} long by {{convert|1|mm}} wide. They also have scabrous margins and pubescent surface. The [[panicle]] is open, linear and is {{convert|6|<U+2013>|14|cm}} long. The axis of the panicle is dominant while the main panicle [[branch]]es are appressed.<ref name=kew/>

Spikelets are elliptic, solitary, are {{convert|5.5|-|6.5|mm}} long and have fertile spikelets that are [[pedicel (botany)|pediceled]]. The pedicels are ciliate, curved,  filiform, and hairy above. The spikelets have 1-2 fertile florets which are  diminished at the apex while the sterile florets are barren, cuneate, and [[Sessility (zoology)|clumped]] with both its [[rhachilla]] and its floret [[callus]] being pubescent. Both the upper and lower [[chaff|glumes]] are keelless, membranous and are of the same size as spikelets. Their other features are different; Lower glume is elliptic with an acute apex while the upper one is lanceolate, and have obtuse apex.<ref name=kew/> 

The species' [[lemma (botany)|lemma]] have ciliated and hairy margins with obtuse apex. The hairs are {{convert|0.8|<U+2013>|1|mm}} long while the fertile lemma is chartaceous, lanceolate, and is {{convert|4.5|<U+2013>|5.5|mm}} long by {{convert|2|mm}} wide. Its [[palea (botany)|palea]] have ciliolated keels and emarginated apex. It is also oblanceolate, {{convert|3.5|<U+2013>|4|mm}} long and is 2 [[leaf vein|veined]]. Flowers are fleshy, oblong, truncate and are {{convert|0.2|<U+2013>|0.3|mm}} long. They also grow together, and have 3 [[stamen|anther]]s that are {{convert|1|-|1.5|mm}} long. The [[fruit]]s have [[caryopsis]] with additional pericarp and linear [[hilum (biology)|hilum]]. They also are ellipsoid and {{convert|2.5|<U+2013>|2.8|mm}} long.<ref name=kew/>

==Ecology==
Its [[flower]]ing time is from October to December.<ref name=Torres>{{cite journal |author=Torres, A.M.|year=1980|title=Revision de las especies Argentinas del genero Melica L. (Gramineae)|publisher=Opera Lilloana|volume=29|pages=1<U+2013>113}}</ref>
