The '''Gotha Go 242''' was a [[military glider|transport glider]] used by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' during [[World War II]].  It was an upgrade over the [[DFS 230]] in both cargo/troop capacity and flight characteristics.  Though it saw limited action, it appeared in multiple variants. 

==Development==
The Go 242 was designed by [[Albert Kalkert]] in response to a ''[[Reichsluftfahrtministerium]]'' (RLM) requirement for a heavy transport glider to replace the [[DFS 230]] then in service. The requirement was for a glider capable of carrying 20 fully laden troops or the equivalent cargo.

The aircraft was a high-wing [[monoplane]] with a simple square-section [[fuselage]] ending in clamshell doors used to load cargo. The empennage was mounted on twin booms linked by a tailplane. The fuselage was formed of steel tubing covered with [[aircraft dope|doped]] fabric. The flight characteristics of the design were better than those of the DFS 230.

Cargo versions of the glider featured a hinged rear fuselage loading ramp that could accommodate a small vehicle such as a ''[[K<U+00FC>belwagen]]'' or loads of similar size and weight.

The glider was tested with rockets for overloaded take offs, a rack of four 48&nbsp;kg (106&nbsp;lb) [[Rheinmetall]] 109-502 rockets mounted on the rear of the cargo compartment. A second rocket called the "R Device" was also used with the glider - it was a liquid-fuel [[Heinkel]] rocket engine R I-203 (HWK 109-500A) which was mounted beneath the wing on either side of the body and was ejected after takeoff, parachuting down to be recycled.

Two prototypes flew in [[1941 in aviation|1941]] and the type quickly entered production. A total of 1,528 were built, 133 of which were converted to the [[Gotha Go 244|Go 244]], with two 500&nbsp;kW (700&nbsp;hp) [[Gnome-Rhone]] engines fitted to forward extensions of the tail booms.

==Operational history==
In service, Go 242s were towed into the air by [[Heinkel He 111]]s or [[Junkers Ju 52]]s, and were occasionally fitted with [[JATO|RATO]] equipment. Most saw service in the [[Mediterranean]], [[North Africa]] and [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87D-2]]s had strengthened rear fuselage and combined tailwheel and hook for towing the Go 242.

A few gliders, the Go 242 C-1 variant, were constructed with a [[flying boat]]-style hull allowing water landings. It was proposed that some carry a small [[catamaran]] assault boat with a {{convert|1200|kg|lb|abbr=on}} explosive charge suspended between its hulls. The proposed mission profile was for the pilot to land near an enemy ship and transfer to the assault boat, setting off at high speed for the enemy ship and locking the controls before bailing out.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Paul|coauthor=Roger Ford|title=Germany's secret weapons in World War II|publisher=Zenith Imprint|date=2000|isbn=0-7603-0847-0}}</ref>
