'''Christopher St Lawrence, 2nd Baron Howth''' ( died 1462 or 1465 ) was an Anglo-Irish nobleman, a key figure in fifteenth-century  Irish politics, and one of the strongest supporters in [[Ireland]] of the [[House of York]]. His [[tomb]] can still be seen in the family chapel in St. Mary's Church, [[Howth]].

==Background==
He was the son of Christopher (or Stephen) St Lawrence, 1st [[Baron Howth]], and his wife  Eleanor, daughter of Sir Robert Holywood of [[Artane, Dublin|Artane]].<ref>Pine, L.G. ''The New Extinct Peerage 1884-1971'' London 1972 p.150</ref> As is often the case with  [[Anglo-Irish]] titles the date of its creation is difficult to determine, since a  "lordship"  or [[Irish feudal barony]] did not necessarily imply a [[peerage]]. It is generally thought that the Crown recognised the elder Christopher as a hereditary [[baron]] around 1425, but Elrington Ball suggests that it was the younger Christopher who was recognised as the first hereditary peer about 1461.<ref>Ball F. Elrington  ''History of Dublin'' Vol.5 1917 Dublin Alexander Thom and Co. p.49</ref>

==As Lord of Howth==
He succeeded  to his father's estates and title in 1430, or according to some accounts in 1435, and did [[homage (medieval)|homage]] to the Crown for his lands in 1437.<ref>Ball, p.49</ref>

He was a man of strong and decided character, and from the start of his career showed a determination to assert his power  over the peninsula of [[Howth]], and to maintain all  rights and claims  which belonged  to the St Lawrence family. When a twelve-foot [[grampus (genus)|grampus]] ([[Risso's Dolphin]]) was stranded at Howth the Crown tried to claim it as [[royal fish]], but  Howth resisted, claiming that since time immemorial every grampus and [[porpoise]] found on the peninsula was the property of the Lord of Howth.<ref>Ball, p.49</ref>

He was the patron of Richard Ingram, an early [[mining]] explorer, and at a  meeting of the Privy Council in 1450 was himself granted the right to search within his lordship for [[lead]] and [[tin]], and if any was found to take the profits for three years. He quarreled with some of the  citizens of [[Wicklow]] over the ownership of [[salt]] which he alleged they had seized unlawfully and had them [[outlawed]];  he also used his influence to have the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] pass legislation to exempt some of his lands from taxation.<ref>Ball, p.50</ref>

==In public life==
Despite his determination to protect his own rights, Howth did not neglect public affairs. He was [[knighted]] before 1442 and became a member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]] in 1450, and from that date played a crucial part in the defence of Dublin.<ref>Ball, p.50</ref> In 1455 he was given the power to exact tolls on all those using [[Howth]] harbour to defray the costs of protecting shipping from "French, Bretons, Scots and other nations". He was also charged with strengthening the bridges at [[Lucan]] and [[Kilmainham]]. The same year he sat on  a commission to inquire into the alleged failure of the [[Sheriff of County Dublin]]  to adequately defend the county, and in 1458 he  sat on another commission to inquire into the conduct of the Walsh family of [[Carrickmines]], whose loyalty to the Crown was suspect.<ref>Ball, p.50</ref>

==Yorkist cause==
When [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]] arrived in Ireland  as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]] in 1449, Lord Howth quickly became one of his strongest allies.<ref>Ball, p.51</ref> He returned with the Duke to England, and remained loyal to him  after the setback to his fortunes which followed  the [[Battle of Ludford Bridge]] in 1459. On Richard's return to Ireland later the same year, Howth was one of his key supporters in the Parliament he  called.  Howth  was appointed to several offices, including Constable of [[Dublin Castle]]. The legislation suggests that he was  intending to  accompany Richard  again to England, as Richard proepared  to claim the English throne from the rival [[House of Lancaster]], but there is no evidence that he was present at the disastrous [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460, where Richard was killed.

The setback to the [[Yorkist]]  cause was only temporary, and was followed by their triumph in the spring of 1461. Richard's son, the victorious King  [[Edward IV]],  confirmed Howth as Constable of Dublin, and reognised his right to sit in the [[Irish House of Lords]].<ref>Ball p.51</ref> He and  his family flourished under the House of York, although later generations were to shift their allegiance to the [[House of Tudor]], who were  by then relatives by marria

There is some confusion over the year of his death; his tomb indicates 1462 but some sources give 1464 or 1465.<ref>Pine, p.150</ref>

==Family==
He married before 1435 Anne Plunkett of Ratoath, a relative of the 1st [[Baron Killeen]].<ref>Pine p.150</ref> She survived him and remarried Anthony Percy, but is buried with her first husband. They had at least six children:
*[[Robert St Lawrence, 3rd Baron Howth]]
*William, [[Admiral]]  of Ireland
*Thomas
*Almeric, Clerk of the Rolls
*Lionel, [[precentor]] of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]]
*[[Walter St. Lawrence]], [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]].

==Character==
Ball describes him as a man of "great qualities":  capable, courageous and determined.<ref>Ball, pp.49-50</ref>
