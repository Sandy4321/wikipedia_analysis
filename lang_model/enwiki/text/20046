'''John McMahon''' (1841 <U+2013> 1912) was an [[United States|American]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] who specialized in [[collar-and-elbow]] wrestling. He competed from 1861 to 1891, traveling throughout the United States and [[Canada]] to face the top wrestlers of the day. He competed in several styles of wrestling, and his biggest rivalry was with Colonel J.H. McLaughlin. Toward the end of his career, he performed in wrestling matches for traveling circuses.

==Career==
Born in Vermont in 1841, McMahon began his professional wrestling career in [[Port Henry, New York]] in June 1861. He won the match, which began an undefeated streak that lasted until 1878.<ref name=man>{{cite web|title=John McMahon|work=Journal of Manly Arts|last=Hewitt|first=Mark S.|url=http://ejmas.com/jmanly/articles/2002/jmanlyart_hewitt_0602.htm|date=June 2002|accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref> Although he favored the collar-and-elbow wrestling practiced in Ireland, the country of his ancestry,<ref name=man/> he also competed in matches that involved [[catch wrestling]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1880-1899|work=NYProWrestling|url=http://www.nyprowrestling.com/results/1880.html|accessdate=2009-05-03}}</ref> McMahon served in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] army during the [[American Civil War]], during which he gained notoriety as a wrestler.<ref name=vt/>

On July 22, 1873, McMahon defeated Thomas Copeland to become recognized as the champion of the United States and Canada. The following month, he also defeated Albert Ellis, who was billed as the champion of England.<ref name=man/> Because McMahon outweighed his opponent by 60 pounds, the match was contested under Cornwall and Devon rules, which required both men to wear short jackets.<ref name=nyt1>{{cite web|title=Wrestling Extraordinary|work=The New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9A02E1DD1239EF34BC4053DFBE668388669FDE|accessdate=2009-05-03|date=1873-08-08}}</ref> His rivalry with Ellis continued, and the pair faced each other twice more. One bout was declared a [[Tie (draw)|draw]] because of a disputed call by the referee.<ref name=man/><ref name=nyt1/> McMahon won the third and final match between the two.<ref name=man/> McMahon also traveled to the Western United States in search of competitors. In 1877, he defeated Harry Thurston in a match held in a lumberyard in California. He was also sent to [[Virginia City, Nevada]] to help a gambler who had lost a large sum of money to "Dakota Bill" Tompkins. Without revealing his identity, McMahon arranged a match with Tompkins, a local championship wrestler. McMahon's friends bet money on McMahon, who defeated Tompkins in a best-of-five match.<ref name=man/>

McMahon wrestled James Farwell in January 1878; Falwell won a controversial victory to retain his status as champion of the Pacific Coast. After McMahon's main rival, Colonel J.H. McLaughlin, retired, McMahon ceased to compete as well. The two had never faced each other, but there was a dispute as to who would win if such a match took place. McMahon returned to Virginia City to open a saloon. In October of that year, McLaughlin offered a bet that nobody would be able to defeat Robert Wright, one of his trainees. McMahon accepted the bet, defeated Wright, and arranged a match against McLaughlin. He defeated McLaughlin in a best-of-three match on November 23, 1878. A rematch took place, which McLaughlin won. The third and final contest between the two took place in March 1879 and ended in a draw.<ref name=man/> On May 12 of that year, McMahon defeated Professor William Miller in a best-of-three match before a crowd of over 2000 spectators in [[Madison Square#Madison Square Garden|Gilmore's Garden]] in New York.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wrestling at Gilmore's|work=The New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E0CE1DD133EE63BBC4B52DFB3668382669FDE|accessdate=2009-05-03|date=1879-05-13}}</ref>

In August 1879, McMahon faced his second cousin once removed,<ref name=nyt3/> James Owens, in the St. James Opera House on [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] in New York City. McMahon lost the first fall but won the next two to claim victory in the match.<ref>{{cite web|title=Two Wrestlers at Work|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=950CE4DA133EE73BBC4F53DFBE668382669FDE|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-05-03|date=1879-08-07}}</ref> They faced each other again on July 16, 1880 for the collar-and-elbow world championship.

In the mid-1880s, McMahon traveled internationally to compete and won titles in Australia and Argentina. In 1884, he defeated John Tedford in England to win the world collar-and-elbow wrestling championship.<ref name=vt/>

In his later career, McMahon faced such wrestlers as [[Sorakichi Matsuda]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Japanese Professional Wrestling Pioneer: Sorakichi Matsuda|work=InYo: Journal of Alternative Perspectives|first=Joseph R.|last=Svinth|url=http://ejmas.com/jalt/jaltart_Svinth1_1100.htm|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref> Captain James C. Daly and Gus Lambert.<ref name=man/> He also faced [[William Muldoon]], now a member of the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum|Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]]. One match between the two, which took place on March 22, 1881, featured a best-of-three-falls rule, in which the wrestlers would competed in Muldoon's favored Greco-Roman style, followed by the collar-and-elbow style preferred by McMahon. Each competitor won the fall in their preferred style, which led to a catch-as-catch-can match to determine the winner. The match did not take place, however, as the men were unable to agree to the outfits that would be worn during the match; as a result, the contest was declared a draw.<ref name=nyt2>{{cite web|title=A Much Mixed Affair|work=The New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E07E0DE163AEF33A25750C2A9659C94609FD7CF|accessdate=2009-05-03|date=1881-03-23}}</ref> One of McMahon's final series of matches was against Henry Moses Dufur. Their first match was declared a draw after neither competitor was able to throw the other within six hours. Although the wrestlers were willing to continue, the lease on the hall had expired and the match was ended at 2:45 in the morning.<ref>{{cite web|title=Good Profits in Wrestling|work=The New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E07E4DE153BE033A2575BC1A9659C94619FD7CF|accessdate=2009-05-03}}</ref> McMahon lost the second contest, but he defeated Dufur for the world collar-and-elbow championship in their final encounter.<ref name=man/>

McMahon also wrestled in traveling circuses. He was part of [[Adam Forepaugh]]'s Circus,<ref name=man/> and he competed for [[P.T. Barnum]]'s circus for over two years. With the latter group, he wrestled over 300 pre-arranged matches against Ed Decker.<ref>{{cite book|page=29|title=Wrestling to Rasslin': Ancient Sport to American Spectacle|publisher=Popular Press|date=2004|isbn=0879723246|first=Gerald W.|last=Morton|coauthors=George M.
