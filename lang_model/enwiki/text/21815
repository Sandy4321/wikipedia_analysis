The son of [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Absalom Willis Robertson|A.

He unsuccessfully campaigned to become the [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican Party]]'s nominee in the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mediamatters.org/issues_topics/people/patrobertson |title=Pat Robertson |publisher=[[Media Matters for America]] |accessdate=2007-03-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070320132805/http://mediamatters.org/issues_topics/people/patrobertson |archivedate = March 20, 2007}}</ref> As a result of his seeking political office, he no longer serves in an official role for any church.

==Life and career==
===Family===
Robertson was born in [[Lexington, Virginia]], into a prominent political family. His parents were [[Absalom Willis Robertson]], a conservative [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]], and his wife Gladys Churchill ([[n<U+00E9>e]] Willis). He married Adelia "Dede" Elmer on August 26, 1954. His family includes four children, among them [[Gordon P. Robertson]] and Tim Robertson and, as of mid-2005, 14 grandchildren. 

At a young age, Robertson was nicknamed ''Pat'' by his six-year-old brother, Willis Robertson, Jr., who enjoyed patting him on the cheeks when he was a baby while saying "pat, pat, pat". As he got older, Robertson thought about which first name he would like people to use. He considered "Marion" to be effeminate, and "M. Gordon" to be affected, so he opted for his childhood nickname "Pat".<ref name="davidjohnmarley" /> His strong awareness for the importance of names in the creation of a public image showed itself again during his presidential run when he threatened to sue [[NBC]] news for calling him a "television evangelist", which later became "televangelist", at a time when [[Jimmy Swaggart]] and [[Jim Bakker]] were objects of scandal.

===Education and military service===
When he was eleven, Robertson was enrolled in the preparatory [[McDonogh School]] outside [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. From 1940 until 1946 he attended [[The McCallie School]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. He graduated with honors and enrolled at [[Washington and Lee University]], where he majored in history. The claim that he was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] is not substantiated by the Phi Beta Kappa membership directory.<ref>Phi Beta Kappa Membership Directory, Vol 1. 2000.</ref> He also joined [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity. Robertson has said, "Although I worked hard at my studies, my real major centered around lovely young ladies who attended the nearby girls schools."<ref>[http://www.patrobertson.com/education/ "Education"], The Official Site of Pat Robertson.</ref> 

In 1948, the [[Conscription|draft]] was reinstated and Robertson was given the option of joining the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] or being drafted into the army; he opted for the first.

In his words, "We did long, grueling marches to toughen the men, plus refresher training in firearms and bayonet combat." In the same year, he transferred to [[Korea]], "I ended up at the headquarters command of the First Marine Division," says Robertson. "The Division was in combat in the hot and dusty, then bitterly cold portion of [[North Korea]] just above the 38th Parallel later identified as the 'Punchbowl' and 'Heartbreak Ridge.' For that service in the [[Korean War]], the Marine Corps awarded me three battle stars for 'action against the enemy.'"<ref>[http://www.patrobertson.com/militaryservice/ "Military Service"], The Official Site of Pat Robertson.</ref>

However, former [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] Congressman [[Pete McCloskey|Paul "Pete" McCloskey, Jr.]], who served with Robertson in Korea, wrote a public letter which said that Robertson was actually spared combat duty when his powerful father, a U.S. Senator, intervened on his behalf, and that Robertson spent most of his time in an office in [[Japan]]. According to McCloskey, his time in the service was not in combat but as the "liquor officer" responsible for keeping the officers' clubs supplied with liquor. Robertson filed a $35 million [[libel]] suit against McCloskey in 1986.<ref>{{cite news|title=Evangelist sues over combat story|work=The Globe and Mail. |location=Toronto, Ont.|date=October 23, 1986|page=A.16}}</ref> He dropped the case in 1988, before it came to trial and paid McCloskey's court costs.<ref>{{cite news|title=ROBERTSON'S LIBEL SUIT BY JUDGE EX-CONGRESSMAN RULED THE LEGAL VICTOR|work=Philadelphia Daily News|date=March 7, 1988|page=14}}</ref>

Robertson was promoted to First Lieutenant in 1952 upon his return to the United States. He then went on to receive a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree from [[Yale University Law School]] in 1955. However, he failed to pass the bar exam,<ref>[http://www.patrobertson.com/SpiritualJourney/SomethingMissing.asp "Spiritual Journey"], The Official Site of Pat Robertson.</ref> shortly thereafter underwent his religious conversion, and decided against pursuing a career in law. Instead, Robertson attended the [[New York Theological Seminary]], and was awarded a [[Master of Divinity]] degree in 1959.

===Religious career===
In 1956 Robertson found his faith through [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[missionary]] Cornelius Vanderbreggen, who impressed Robertson both by his lifestyle and his message. Vanderbreggen quoted [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] (3:5, 6), "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths", which Robertson considers to be the "guiding principle" of his life. He was ordained as a minister of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] in 1961.

In 1960, Robertson established the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]. He started it by buying a small [[UHF]] station in nearby [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]]. Later in 1977 he purchased a local access cable channel in the Hampton Roads area and called it CBN. Originally he went door-to-door in Virginia Beach, Hampton Roads, and other surrounding areas asking Christians to buy cable boxes so that they could receive his new channel. He also canvassed local churches in the Virginia Beach area to do the same, and solicited donations through public speaking engagements at local churches and on CBN. One of his friends, John Giminez, the pastor of Rock Church Virginia Beach, was influential in helping Robertson establish CBN with donations, as well as offering the services of volunteers from his church.

CBN is now seen in 180 countries and broadcast in 71 languages. He founded the CBN Cable Network, which was renamed the CBN Family Channel in 1988 and later simply the [[Family Channel]]. When the Family Channel became too profitable for Robertson to keep it under the CBN umbrella without endangering CBN's nonprofit status, he formed [[International Family Entertainment Inc.]] in 1990 with the Family Channel as its main subsidiary. Robertson sold the Family Channel to the [[News Corporation]] in 1997, which renamed it Fox Family. A condition of the sale was that the station would continue airing Robertson's television program, ''[[The 700 Club]]'', twice a day in perpetuity, regardless of any changes of ownership. The channel is now owned by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and run as "[[ABC Family]]". On December 3, 2007, Robertson resigned as chief executive of CBN; he was succeeded by his son, [[Gordon P. Robertson|Gordon]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Web Site Design and Hosting by LogicalSolutions.net <U+2013> An Internet Marketing Company |url=http://www.splc.org/newsflash.asp?id=1655&year |title=Student Press Law Center <U+2013> News Flashes |publisher=Splc.org |date=2007-10-18 |accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref>

Robertson founded CBN University in 1977 on CBN's Virginia Beach campus. It was renamed [[Regent University]] in 1989. Robertson serves as its [[chancellor]]. He is also founder and president of the [[American Center for Law and Justice]], a public interest law firm that defends Christians whose [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights have allegedly been violated. The law firm, headquartered in the same building that houses Regent's [[law school]], focuses on "[[pro-family]], pro-liberty and [[pro-life]]" cases nationwide.

Robertson is also an advocate of Christian [[dominionism]] &mdash; the idea that Christians have a right to rule.<ref name="Goldberg2006">Goldberg, Michelle. 2006. Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism. 1st ed. W. W. Norton.</ref>

In 1994, he was a signer of the document [[Evangelicals and Catholics Together]].

Pat Robertson was a fundraiser for the [[Nicaraguan Contra]]s. In March 1986, he told ''Israeli Foreign Affairs'' that [[South Africa]] was a major contributor to the [[Reagan administration]]'s efforts to help the anti-[[Sandinista]] forces.<ref>Marshall, Jonathan; Scott, Peter Dale; and Hunter, Jane. "The Iran-Contra Connection" Black Rose Books. Montreal & New York. 1987.</ref>

===1988 presidential bid===
{{see also|United States presidential election, 1988}}

In September 1986, Robertson announced his intention to seek the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] nomination for [[President of the United States]]. Robertson said he would pursue the nomination only if three million people signed up to volunteer for his campaign by September 1987. Three million responded, and by the time Robertson announced he would be running in September 1987, he also had raised millions of dollars for his campaign fund. He surrendered his ministerial credentials and turned leadership of CBN over to his son, Tim. His campaign, however, against incumbent [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[George H. W. Bush]], was seen as a long shot. 

Robertson ran on a standard [[American conservatism|conservative]] platform. Among his policies, he wanted to ban [[pornography]], reform the education system,<!--eliminate [[Conrail]] and [[Amtrak]], and --> and eliminate departments such as the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]. He also supported a [[Amendments to the Constitution of the United States|constitutional amendment]] requiring a [[Balanced Budget Amendment|balanced federal budget]].

Robertson's campaign got off to a strong second-place finish in the [[Iowa caucus]], ahead of Bush.<ref>[http://iowapresidentialpolitics.com/caucus_info/bergenaswinebrenner.html "About the caucuses: Meaningful test"], Johan Bergenas, Iowa Presidential Politics.com.</ref> He did poorly in the subsequent [[New Hampshire primary]], however, and was unable to be competitive once the multiple-state primaries began. Robertson ended his campaign before the primaries were finished. His best finish was in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], winning the majority of caucus delegates.<ref>[http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/story/273555.html "Primary versus caucus fight rolls on among state politicians"], Niki Sullivan, Tacoma News Tribune.</ref><ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2D81539F93AA35750C0A96E948260 " Bush routs Dole in primaries"], Michale Oreskes, New York Times.</ref> He later spoke at the [[1988 Republican National Convention]] in [[New Orleans]] and told his remaining supporters to cast their votes for Bush, who ended up winning the nomination and the election. He then returned to CBN and has remained there as a religious broadcaster.

===Books===
{{Main|The New World Order (Robertson)}}

[[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] professor of theology Ephraim Radner accuses Robertson of espousing [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] beliefs in the book:

{{bquote|In his published writings, especially his 1991 book ''[[The New World Order (Robertson)|The New World Order]]'', Pat Robertson has propagated theories about a worldwide [[Jewish]] conspiracy.

===Business interests===
Robertson is the founder and chairman of [[Christian Broadcasting Network|The Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) Inc.]], and founder of [[International Family Entertainment Inc.]], [[Regent University]], [[Operation Blessing]] International Relief and Development Corporation, [[American Center for Law and Justice]], The Flying Hospital, Inc. and several other organizations and broadcast entities. Robertson was the founder and co-chairman of [[International Family Entertainment Inc.]] (IFE). 

Formed in 1990, IFE produced and distributed family entertainment and information programming worldwide. IFE's principal business was The Family Channel, a satellite delivered cable-television network with 63 million U.S. subscribers. IFE, a publicly held company listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], was sold in 1997 to [[Fox Kids]] Worldwide, Inc. for $1.9 billion, whereupon it was renamed [[Fox Family Channel]]. [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] acquired FFC in 2001 and its name was changed again, to [[ABC Family]].

Robertson is a global businessman with media holdings in [[Asia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Africa]]. He struck a deal with [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]-based [[General Nutrition Center]] to produce and market a weight-loss shake he created and promoted on ''The 700 Club''.

In 1999, Robertson entered into a joint venture with the [[Bank of Scotland]] to provide financial services in the United States. However, the move was met with criticism in the UK due to Robertson's views on [[homosexuality]]. Robertson commented that <U+201C>In Europe, the big word is tolerance. You tolerate everything. Homosexuals are riding high in the media ... And in Scotland, you can't believe how strong the homosexuals are." Shortly afterward, the Bank of Scotland canceled the venture.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/361736.stm |title=The Company File &#124; Bank drops evangelist |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-06-05 |accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/gay-jibe-may-lead-to-bank-boycott-1097726.html |title=Gay jibe may lead to bank boycott |publisher=The Independent |date=1999-06-03 |accessdate=2010-02-01 | location=London | first=Mary | last=Braid}}</ref>

Robertson's extensive business interests have earned him a net worth estimated between $200 million and $1 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/news/pat_quotes/palst.htm |title=Palast investigates Pat Robertson |publisher=Sullivan-county.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref>

A fan of [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing]], Robertson paid $520,000 for a colt he named Mr. Pat. Trained by [[John C. Kimmel|John Kimmel]], Mr. Pat was not a successful runner. He was nominated for, but did not run in, the 2000 [[Kentucky Derby]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thoroughbredtimes.com/racing-news/2002/February/10/Complete-list-of-Triple-Crown-nominees.aspx |title=Complete list of Triple Crown nominees |publisher=Thoroughbred Times |date=2002-02-10 |accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pedigreequery.com/mr+pat |title=Mr Pat Horse Pedigree |publisher=Pedigreequery.com |date=2007-04-30 |accessdate=2010-01-15}}</ref>

According to a June 2, 1999, article in ''[[The Virginian-Pilot]]'',<ref>Sizemore, Bill.  "Robertson, Liberian Leader Hope to Strike Gold in Coastal Africa."  ''The Virginian-Pilot''.  2 June 1999.  ( Copy found at [http://groups.google.com/group/misc.activism.progressive/browse_thread/thread/dca03c4012450e0c/f230a667e3ff73d5].) Charles Taylor...</ref> Robertson had extensive business dealings with [[Liberia]]n president [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]]. According to the article, Taylor gave Robertson the rights to mine for [[diamonds]] in Liberia's mineral-rich countryside. According to two [[Operation Blessing]] pilots who reported this incident to the state of [[Virginia]] for investigation in 1994, Robertson used his Operation Blessing planes to haul diamond-mining equipment to Robertson's mines in Liberia, despite the fact that Robertson was telling his ''700 Club'' viewers that the planes were sending relief supplies to the victims of the [[genocide]] in [[Rwanda]]. In response to Taylor's alleged [[crimes against humanity]], the [[United States Congress]] passed a bill In November 2003 that offered two million dollars for his capture. Robertson accused President [[George W. Bush]] of "undermining a Christian, [[Baptist]] president to bring in [[Muslim]] rebels to take over the country."  At the time Taylor was harboring [[Al Qaeda]] operatives who were funding their operations through the illegal diamond trade.<ref name='nationrobertson'>{{cite news | first=Max | last=Blumenthal | coauthors= | title= Pat Robertson's Katrina Cash | date=2005-09-07 | publisher= | url =http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050919/blumenthal | work =The Nation Online | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-19 | language = }}</ref>
On February 4, 2010, at his [[war crimes]] trial in [[the Hague]], Taylor testified that Robertson was his main political ally in the U.S., and that he had volunteered to make Liberia's case before U.S. administration officials in exchange for concessions to Robertson's Freedom Gold, Ltd., to which Taylor gave a contract to mine gold in southeast Liberia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://turtlebay.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/02/05/charles_taylor_pat_robertson_was_my_man_in_washington |title=Charles Taylor: Pat Robertson was my man in Washington &#124; Turtle Bay |publisher=Turtlebay.foreignpolicy.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref> In 2010, a spokesman for Robertson said that the company's arrangements &mdash; in which the Liberian government got a 10 percent equity interest in the company and Liberians could purchase at least 15 percent of the shares after the exploration period &mdash; was similar to many American companies doing business in Africa at the time.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/pat-robertsons-gold-deal-african-dictator/story?id=9749341 |title= Prosecutor: Pat Robertson Had Gold Deal with African Dictator; Prosecutors in Human Rights Trial Allege Pat Robertson Lobbied George Bush on Behalf of Liberian Warlord Charles Taylor |work=ABC News |date=February 4, 2010 |author=Anna Schecter }}</ref>

==Political activism==
After his unsuccessful presidential campaign, Robertson started the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]], a 1.7 million member [[Christian right]] organization that campaigned mostly for conservative candidates.<ref name="davidjohnmarley" /> It was sued by the [[Federal Election Commission]] "for coordinating its activities with Republican candidates for office in 1990, 1992 and 1994 and failing to report its expenditures"<ref>[http://www.au.org/site/News2?JServSessionIdr005=ao8o141u41.app7b&abbr=pr&page=NewsArticle&id=6105&news_iv_ctrl=1523 "In Closed-Door Session with Christian Coalition State Leaders, Pat Robertson Unveils Plan to Control GOP Presidential Nomination"], September 18, 1997, Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</ref>

In 1994, the Coalition was fined for "improperly [aiding] then Representative [[Newt Gingrich]] (R-[[Georgia (U.S. state)|GA]]) and [[Oliver North]], who was then the Republican Senate nominee in Virginia."<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_22_116/ai_55670890 "Christian Coalition wins on voter guides <U+2014> allowed to distribute guides, but can not support candidates"], Rns, ''Christian Century'', August 11, 1999.</ref> Robertson left the Coalition in 2001.

Robertson has been a governing member of the [[Council for National Policy]] (CNP): Board of Governors 1982, President Executive Committee 1985<U+2013>86, member, 1984, 1988, 1998.<ref>See also Barbara A.

On November 7, 2007, Robertson announced that he was endorsing [[Rudy Giuliani]] to be the Republican nominee in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8SOUT000&show_article=1&lst=1 |title=Pat Robertson Backs Giuliani's Bid |publisher=Breitbart.com |date=2007-11-07 |accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref>

While usually associated with the [[political right]], Pat Robertson has recently begun endorsing environmental causes. He appears in a commercial with [[Al Sharpton]], joking about this, and urging people to join the We can Solve it Campaign against [[global warming]].<ref>[http://www.wecansolveit.org/page/s/unlikelyalliance?source=Ad.com&subsource=SharptonandRobertson728X90 ]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}</ref>

In January 2009, on a broadcast of ''The 700 Club'', Robertson stated that he is "adamantly opposed" to the division of [[Jerusalem]] between [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]]. He also stated that [[Armageddon]] is "not going to be fought at [[Megiddo]]" but will be the "battle of Jerusalem," when "the forces of all nations come together and try to take Jerusalem away from the Jews. Jews are not going to give up Jerusalem &mdash; they shouldn't &mdash; and the rest of the world is going to insist they give it up." Robertson added that Jerusalem is a "spiritual symbol that must not be given away" because "[[Jesus Christ]] the [[Messiah]] will come down to the part of Jerusalem that the [[Arab]]s want," and that's "not good."<ref>[http://jta.org/news/article/2009/02/03/1002739/robertson-armageddon-will-be-battle-over-jerusalem Robertson sees Armageddon in Jerusalem struggle] by Eric Fingerhut, Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), February 3, 2009.</ref>

The week of [[September 11th attacks|September 11, 2001]], Robertson discussed the terror attacks with [[Jerry Falwell]], who said that "the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] has to take a lot of blame for this" in addition to "the [[pagan]]s, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays, and the [[lesbian]]s [who have] helped [the terror attacks of September 11th] happen."

Less than two weeks after [[Hurricane Katrina]] killed 1,836 people, Robertson implied on the September 12th broadcast of ''The 700 Club'' that the storm was God's punishment in response to America's abortion policy. He suggested that September 11 and the disaster in New Orleans "could... be connected in some way".<ref>{{cite news

On November 9, 2009, Robertson said that Islam is "a violent political system bent on the overthrow of the governments of the world and world domination." He went on to elaborate that "you're dealing with not a religion, you're dealing with a political system, and I think we should treat it as such, and treat its adherents as such as we would members of the [[communist party]], members of some [[fascist]] group."<ref>{{cite web|last=Hamby |first=Peter |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/11/18/mcdonnell-won%E2%80%99t-disavow-robertson%E2%80%99s-islam-remarks/ |title=McDonnell won<U+2019>t disavow Robertson<U+2019>s Islam remarks |publisher=CNN |date=2009-11-18 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}</ref>

==Predictions==
Several times near [[New Year]], Robertson has announced that God told him several truths or events that would happen in the following year. "I have a relatively good track record," he said. "Sometimes I miss."<ref>{{cite web|author=11:53 p.m. ET |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16442877/ |title=Pat Robertson warns of terrorist attack in <U+2019>07 <U+2013><U+2013> Life <U+2013> MSNBC.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-01-02 |accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref>

===1982: Doomsday===
In late 1976, Robertson predicted that the end of the world was coming in October or November 1982. In a May 1980 broadcast of ''The 700 Club'' he stated, "I guarantee you by the end of 1982 there is going to be a judgment on the world."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abhota.info/end3.htm |title=Doomsday: 1971<U+2013>1997 |publisher=Abhota.info |date= |accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref>

===2006: Pacific Northwestern tsunami===
In May 2006, Robertson declared that storms and possibly a [[tsunami]] would hit America's coastline sometime in 2006. Robertson supposedly received this revelation from God during an annual personal prayer retreat in January. The claim was repeated four times on ''The 700 Club''. 

On May 8, 2006, Robertson said, "If I heard the Lord right about 2006, the coasts of America will be lashed by storms." On May 17, 2006, he elaborated, "There well may be something as bad as a tsunami in the [[Pacific Northwest]]." <ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003004452_pat19.html "God is warning of big storms, Robertson says"], May 19, 2006, The Associated Press.</ref> While this claim didn't garner the same level of controversy as some of his other statements, it was generally received with mild amusement by the Pacific Northwest media. The [[History Channel]]'s initial airing of its new series, ''[[Mega Disasters]]'', debut episode "West Coast Tsunami", was broadcast the first week of May.

===2007: Terror attack===
On the January 2, 2007, broadcast of ''The 700 Club'', Robertson said that [[God]] spoke to him and told him that "mass killings" were to come during 2007, due to a [[terrorist]] attack on the United States.  He added, "The Lord didn't say [[nuclear terrorism|nuclear]]. But I do believe it will be something like that."<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16442877/ "Pat Robertson warns of terrorist attack in 2007"], January 2, 2007, MSNBC.com.</ref> When a terrorist attack failed to happen in 2007, Robertson said, in January 2008, "All I can think is that somehow the people of God prayed and God in his mercy spared us."<ref name = "FoxNews-Predicts"/>

===2008: Worldwide violence and American recession===
On the January 2, 2008, episode of ''The 700 Club'', Pat Robertson predicted that 2008 would be a year of worldwide violence. He also predicted that a [[recession]] would occur in the United States that would be followed by a [[stock market crash]] by 2010.<ref name = "FoxNews-Predicts">{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,319728,00.html |title=Pat Robertson Predicts Worldwide Violence, U.S. Recession in 2008 |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=2008-01-02 |accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref>  However, there was a decrease in overall deaths for the period,<ref>[http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=PopDiv&f=variableID%3A65 UNdata: Crude death rate (per 1,000 population)]</ref> and the American economy had already entered a recession in 2007, with increased household debt<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12637090 |title=The End of the Affair |publisher=Economist |date=October 30, 2008 |accessdate=February 27, 2009}}</ref> and the collapse of financial institutions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html|title=Agency's <U+2019>04 Rule Let Banks Pile Up New Debt, and Risk | work=The New York Times | first=Stephen | last=Labaton | date=October 3, 2008 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref>

===2008: Mideast meltdown===
In October 2008 Robertson posted a press release on the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] Conflict speculating that the conflict is a [[Russia]]n ploy to enter the [[Middle East]], and that instability caused by a predicted pre-emptive strike by [[Israel]] on [[Iran]] would result in [[Syria]]'s and Iran's launching nuclear strikes on other targets. He also said that if the [[United States]] were to oppose Russia's expansion, nuclear strikes on American soil are also pending. "We will suffer grave economic damage, but will not engage in military action to stop the conflict.  However, we may not be spared nuclear strikes against coastal cities. In conclusion, it is my opinion that we have between 75 and 120 days before the Middle East starts spinning out of control." <ref name = "An Urgent Call To Prayer Regarding Georgia">{{cite web|url=http://www.patrobertson.com/pressreleases/PatRobertsonRegardingGeorgia.asp |title=Robertson predicts Mideast disaster and nuclear strikes on America during or shortly after American Election |publisher=Patrobertson.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref>

===2009: Economic chaos and recovery===
On the January 1, 2009, broadcast of ''The 700 Club'', Robertson said, "If I'm hearing [God] right, gold will go to about $1900 dollars an ounce and oil to $300 a barrel."  He also suggested that Americans would broadly accept [[socialism]].  Despite these predictions, he also said that economically, "things are getting ready to turn around."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=85243 |title=Pat Robertson: God says U.S. will accept socialism |publisher=Wnd.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>
