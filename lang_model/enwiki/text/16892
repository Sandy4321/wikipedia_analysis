The '''Radhanites''' (also '''Radanites''', [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] sing. '''<U+05E8><U+05D3><U+05D4><U+05E0><U+05D9>''' ''Radhani'', pl. '''<U+05E8><U+05D3><U+05D4><U+05E0><U+05D9><U+05DD>''' ''Radhanim''; [[Arabic language|Arabic]] '''<U+0627><U+0644><U+0631><U+0630><U+0646><U+064A><U+0629>''' ''ar-Ra<U+00F0>aniyya'') were [[medieval]] [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[merchant]]s. Whether the term, which is used by only a limited number of primary sources, refers to a specific [[guild]], or a [[clan]], or is a generic term for Jewish merchants in the trans-[[Eurasia]]n trade network is unclear. Jewish merchants dominated [[trade]] between the [[Christendom|Christian]] and [[Islamic world]]s during the [[early Middle Ages]] (approx. 600<U+2013>1000 CE). Many trade routes previously established under the [[Roman Empire]] continued to function during that period largely through their efforts. Their trade network covered much of [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]] and parts of [[India]] and [[China]].

==Etymology==
Several etymologies have been suggested for the word "Radhanite". Many scholars, including [[Barbier de Meynard]] and [[Moshe Gil]], believe it refers to a district in [[Mesopotamia]] called "the land of Radhan" in Arabic and Hebrew texts of the period.{{ref|gil1}} Others maintain that their center was the city of [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] (Rhages) in northern [[Persia]].{{ref|rhages}} [[Cecil Roth]]  and [[Claude Cahen]], among others, make the same claim about the [[Rh<U+00F4>ne River]] valley in [[France]], which is ''Rhodanus'' in [[Latin]].  The latter claim that the center of Radhanite activity was probably in France as all of their trade routes began there.{{ref|France}}  Still others maintain that the name derives from the [[Persian language|Persian]] terms ''rah'' "way, path" and  ''d<U+0101>n'' "one who knows", meaning "one who knows the way".{{ref|gil2}} English-language (or Western) sources added the suffix ''-ite'' to the term, as is done with [[ethnonym]]s or names derived from place names.

==Activities==
The activities of the Radhanites are documented by Ab<U+016B> l-Qasim Ubaid Allah [[ibn Khordadbeh]], the Director of Posts and Police (spymaster and postman) for the province of [[Jibal]] under the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mu'tamid]] (ruled 869<U+2013>885 CE), when he wrote ''Kitab al-Masalik wal-Mamalik'' ("The [[Book of Roads and Kingdoms (ibn Khordadbeh)|Book of Roads and Kingdoms]]"), probably around 870. Ibn Khordadbeh described the Radhanites as sophisticated and multilingual. He outlined four main trade routes utilized by the Radhanites in their journeys. All four began in the Rh<U+00F4>ne Valley of France and terminated in [[China]]. The commodities carried by the Radhanites were primarily those which combined small bulk and high demand, including [[spice]]s, [[perfume]]s, [[jewelry]], and [[silk]]. They are also described as transporting [[oil]]s, [[incense]], [[steel]] weapons, [[fur]]s, and [[slavery|slaves]] (in particular, ''[[Saqaliba|Saq<U+0101>liba]]'').

: ''These merchants speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Byzantine Greek language|Roman]], {{ref|Roman}} the [[Old French|Frank]], {{ref|Frankish}} [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Slavic languages|Slav]] languages. They journey from West to East, from East to West, partly on land, partly by sea. They transport from the West [[eunuch]]s, female slaves, boys, [[silk|brocade]], [[beaver|castor]], [[marten]] and other furs, and [[sword]]s. They take ship from Firanja ''(France{{ref|France}})'', on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Western Sea]], and make for Farama ''([[Pelusium]])''. There they load their goods on [[camel]]-back and [[camel train|go by land]] to al-Kolzum ''([[Suez]])'', a distance of twenty-five ''farsakhs'' ''([[parasang]]s)''. They embark in the [[Red Sea|East Sea]] and sail from al-Kolzum to al-Jar ''(port of [[Medina]])'' and [[Jeddah|al-Jeddah]], then they go to [[Sindh|Sind]], [[India]], and [[China]]. On their return from China they carry back [[musk]], [[aloe]]s, [[camphor]], [[cinnamon]], and other products of the Eastern countries to al-Kolzum and bring them back to Farama, where they again embark on the Western Sea. Some make sail for [[Constantinople]] to sell their goods to the [[Byzantine Empire|Romans]]; others go to the palace of the [[Kings of the Franks|King of the Franks]] to place their goods. Sometimes these Jew merchants, when embarking from the land of the [[Franks]], on the Western Sea, make for [[Antioch]] ''(at the head of the [[Orontes River]])''; thence by land to al-Jabia ''([[al-Hanaya]] on the bank of the [[Euphrates River|Euphrates]])'', where they arrive after three days<U+2019> march.  There they embark on the Euphrates and reach [[Baghdad]], whence they sail down the [[Tigris River|Tigris]], to [[al-Obolla]]. From al-Obolla they sail for [[Oman]], [[Sind]], [[Republic of India|Hind]], and China<U+2026>''

: ''These different journeys can also be made by land. The merchants that start from Spain or France go to [[Sus al-Aksa]] ''(in [[Morocco]])'' and then to [[Tangier]], whence they walk to [[Kairouan]] and the capital of [[Egypt]]. Thence they go to ar-[[Ramla]], visit [[Damascus]], al-[[Kufa]], Baghdad, and al-[[Basra]], cross [[Ahwaz]], [[Fars]], [[Kirman]], Sind, Hind, and arrive in China. ''
:''Sometimes, also, they take the route behind [[Rome]]{{ref|rome}} and, passing through the country of the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], arrive at [[Khamlij|Khamlidj]], the capital of the [[Khazars]]. They embark on the [[Caspian Sea|Jorjan Sea]], arrive at [[Balkh]], betake themselves from there across the [[Oxus River|Oxus]], and continue their journey toward [[Yurt]], [[Uyghur people|Toghuzghuz]], and from there to China.''{{ref|Khordadbeh}}

==Historical significance==
[[Image:Menare.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A caravan of [[dromedaries]] in [[Algeria]]. Much of the Radhanites' overland trade between Tangier and Mesopotamia would have been transported by camel.]]

During the [[Early Middle Ages]] the [[Islam]]ic policies of the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] and the Christian kingdoms of [[Europe]] often banned each others' merchants from entering their ports.{{ref|ban}} [[Corsairs]] of both sides raided the shipping of their adversaries at will. The Radhanites functioned as neutral go-betweens, keeping open the lines of communication and trade between the lands of the old [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Far East]]. As a result of the revenue they brought, Jewish merchants enjoyed significant privileges under the early [[Carolingians]] in France and throughout the Muslim world, a fact that greatly vexed the local Church authorities. 

While most trade between Europe and East Asia had historically been conducted via Persian and [[Central Asia]]n intermediaries, the Radhanites were among the first to establish a trade network which stretched from Western Europe to Eastern Asia.{{ref|network}} More remarkable still, they engaged in this trade regularly and over an extended period of time, centuries before [[Marco Polo]] and [[ibn Battuta]] brought their tales of travel in the [[Orient]] to the Christians and the Muslims, respectively. Indeed, ibn Battuta is believed to have travelled with the Muslim traders who travelled to the Orient on routes similar to those used by the Radhanites.

While traditionally many historians believed that the art of Chinese [[paper]]-making had been transmitted to Europe via Arab merchants who got the secret from [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] taken at [[Battle of Talas|Talas]], some believe that Jewish merchants such as the Radhanites were instrumental in bringing paper-making west.{{ref|paper}} [[Joseph of Spain]], possibly a Radhanite, is credited by some sources with introducing the so-called [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]] from India to Europe.{{ref|Joseph}} Historically, Jewish communities used [[letters of credit]] to transport large quantities of money without the risk of theft from at least classical times.{{ref|Josephus}} This system was developed and put into force on an unprecedented scale by medieval Jewish merchants such as the Radhanites; if so, they may be counted among the precursors to the [[bank]]s that arose during the [[late Middle Ages]] and [[early modern period]].{{ref|credit}}

Some scholars believe that the Radhanites may have played a role in the conversion of the [[Khazars]] to Judaism.{{ref|Khaz}} In addition, they may have helped establish Jewish communities at various points along their trade routes, and were probably involved in the early Jewish settlement of [[Eastern Europe]], Central Asia, China and India.

[[Image:Dhow.jpg|right|thumbnail|280px|Much of the Radhanites' [[Indian Ocean]] trade would have been carried out through coastal cargo ships such as this [[dhow]].]]

Besides ibn Khordadbeh, the Radhanites are mentioned by name only by a handful of sources. [[Ibn al-Faqih]]'s early tenth century ''[[Kitab al-Buldan]]'' ("Book of the Countries") mentions them, but much of ibn al-Faqih's information was derived from ibn Khordadbeh's work. ''Sefer ha-Dinim'', a Hebrew account of the travels of [[Yehuda ben Meir]] of [[Mainz]], named [[Przemy<U+015B>l]] and [[Kiev]] as trading sites along the Radhanite route. In the early twelfth century, a French-Jewish trader named [[Yitzhak Dorbelo]] wrote that he travelled with Radhanite merchants to [[Poland]].{{ref|late}}

==The end of the Radhanite age==
The fall of the [[Tang Dynasty]] of [[China]] in 908 and the destruction of the [[Khazars|Khazar]] [[Khagan]]ate some sixty years later led to widespread chaos in Inner [[Eurasia]], the [[Caucasus]] and China. Trade routes became unstable and unsafe, a situation exacerbated by [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] invasions of Persia and the [[Middle East]], and the [[Silk Road]] largely collapsed for centuries. Moreover, the fragmentation of the [[Dar al-Islam|Islamic world]] (and to a lesser extent, [[Christendom]]) into small states provided more opportunities for non-Jews to enter the market. This period saw the rise of the [[mercantile]] [[Italy|Italian]] [[city-states]], especially [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Pisa]], and [[Amalfi]], who viewed the Radhanites as unwanted competitors. 

The economy of Europe was profoundly affected by the disappearance of the Radhanites. For example, documentary evidence indicates that many [[spice]]s in regular use during the early Middle Ages completely disappeared from European tables in the 900s. Jews had previously, in large parts of Western Europe, enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the spice trade.{{ref|spice}}

# {{note|Roman}} That is, the language of the [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Byzantine Greek language|Greek]].
# {{note|Frankish}} It is unclear to what specific language Ibn Khordadbeh refers. The word ''"Firanj"'' can be used to mean "[[Franks|Frank]]" and thus most likely the language referred to is either the [[Vulgar Latin]] dialect that ultimately evolved into [[French language|French]] or the [[Germanic language]] originally spoken by the Franks, called [[Old Frankish language|Old Frankish]] by linguists. However, in the Middle Ages ''Firanj'' was a generic term used by Arabs (and Eastern Christians) for Western Europeans generally. It is possible that Ibn Khordadbeh uses "Frank" as a counterpoint to "Roman" ([[Byzantine Greek language|Byzantine Greek]]), indicating that the Radhanites spoke the languages of both Eastern and Western Christians.
