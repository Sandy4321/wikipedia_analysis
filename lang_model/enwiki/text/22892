This is perhaps the main reason why the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous Pashtuns]] still follow Pashtunwali codes, which is a basic common law of the land or "code of life".

Pashtunwali rules are accepted in Afghanistan and Pakistan (mainly in and around the [[Pashtunistan]] region), including by some of the Pashtun communities around the world. Some non-Pashtun Afghans and others have also adopted its [[ideology]] or practices for their own benefit. On the other hand, many urbanized Pashtuns tend to ignore the rules of Pashtunwali most of the time. Passed by generation to generation, the Pashtunwali rules guide both individual and communal conducts. It is socially practiced by the majority of the Pashtuns and helps to promote [[Pashtunization]].<ref name="Banting"/>{{Quote|Ideal Pukhtun behaviour approximates the features Pukhtunwali, the code of the Pukhtuns, which includes the following traditional features: courage (tora), revenge (badal), hospitality (melmestia), generosity to a defeated...<ref>Maliha Zulfacar, Afghan Immigrants in the USA and Germany: A Comparative Analysis of the Use of Ethnic Social Capital (Kulturelle Identithat Und Politische Selbstbestimmung in Der) (Paperback) (February 1, 1999). pg.33.

=== Main principles ===

Some useful words that signify individual or collective Pashtun tribal functions are given below in the [[Pashto language]]. Although there could be many principles involved the following nine form the major components of Pashtunwali.

#'''[[Melmastia]] (hospitality)''' - Showing hospitality and profound respect to all visitors, regardless of distinctions of race, religion, national affiliation as well as economic status and doing so without any hope of remuneration or favour. Pashtuns will go to great extents to show their hospitality.<ref name="Banting" /><ref>Rob Schultheis, Hunting Bin Laden: How Al-Qaeda Is Winning the War on Terror (2008), p. 14.</ref><ref>Rizwan Hussain, Pakistan and the emergence of Islamic militancy in Afghanistan (2005), p. 221.</ref>
#'''[[Nanawatai]] (asylum)''' - Derived from the verb meaning ''to go in'', this is used for protection given to a person who requests protection against his/her enemies. The people are protected at all costs, in many cases even people running from the law must be given refuge until the situation is clarified.<ref name="Banting" /> It can also be used when the vanquished party is prepared to go in to the house of the victors and ask for their forgiveness. (It is a peculiar form of "chivalrous" surrender, in which an enemy seeks "sanctuary" at his enemy's house). A more famous example of this code is of Navy Petty Officer First Class (PO1) [[Marcus Luttrell]], the sole surviving member of a [[US Navy SEAL]] team that was ambushed by Taliban fighters. PO1 Luttrell evaded the enemy for days before stumbling upon members of the Sabray tribe who realized the wounded SEAL needed assistance. He was taken to the village and protected by the tribal chief, who even sent word to nearby US forces of PO1 Luttrell's location.
#'''[[Badal]] (justice)''' - To seek justice or [[Vendetta|take revenge]] against the wrongdoer. This applies to injustices committed yesterday or 1000 years ago if the wrongdoer still exists. Justice in Pashtun lore needs elaborating: even a mere taunt (or "Paighor") is regarded as an insult - which can only usually be redressed by shedding of the taunter's blood (and if he isn't available, then his next closest male relation). This in turn leads to a blood feud that can last generations and involve whole tribes with the loss of hundreds of lives. Normally blood feuds in this all male dominated setup are then settled in a number of ways.<ref name="Banting" />
#'''[[Tureh]] (bravery)''' - A Pashtun must defend his land/property, family and women from incursions wherever he or she might reside. A Pashtun should always stand brave against tyranny and he should always be able to defend his property, family, women and the honour of his name. Death can follow if anyone mistreats these traits.<ref name="Banting" />
#'''[[Sabat]] (loyalty)''' - Loyalty must be paid to one's family, friends, and tribe members. Loyalty is a must and a Pashtun can never become disloyal as this would be utterly shameful towards themselves and their families.
#'''[[Imandari]] (righteousness)''' - A Pashtun must always strive towards thinking good thoughts, speaking good words and doing other good deeds. Pashtuns must behave respectfully towards all creations including people, animals and the environment around them. Pollution of the environment or its destruction is against the Pashtunwali.<ref name="Banting" />
#'''[[Isteqamat]]''' - Trust in [[God]] (known as "[[Allah]]" in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and "[[Allah|Khudai-ta-Allah]]"  in Pashto).<ref name="Banting" /> The notion of trusting in the one [[Creator]] generally comports to [[Islam]]ic idea of belief in only one God (''[[tawheed]]'').
#'''[[Ghayrat]] (self honour or dignity)''' - Pashtuns must maintain their human dignity. Honour has great importance in Pashtun society and most other codes of life are aimed towards the preservation of one's honour or pride. They must respect themselves and others in order to be able to do so, especially those they do not know. Respect begins at home, among family members and relatives.<ref name="Banting" />
#'''[[Namus]] (Honor of women)''' - A Pashtun must defend the honor of Pashtun women at all costs and must protect them from vocal and physical harm.<ref name="Banting" />
