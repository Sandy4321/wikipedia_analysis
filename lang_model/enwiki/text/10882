'''Dwight Hicks''' (born April 5, 1956) is a former professional [[American football]] player who played [[defensive back]] for the [[Toronto Argonauts]] in 1978, the [[San Francisco 49ers]] from 1979 to 1985, and for the [[Indianapolis Colts]] in 1986.

==High school and college==
Hicks played [[high school football]] at [[Pennsauken High School]] in [[Pennsauken Township, New Jersey]], where he led the football team  to a 9-1 record in 1972 and a #2 ranking in South Jersey by the ''[[Courier-Post]]''.<ref>Benevento, Don. [http://www.courierpostonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071016/VARSITY/710160397/1020/RSS04 "Together again: Pennsauken coach, player enter Hall"], ''[[Courier-Post]]'', October 16, 2007. Accessed December 18, 2007. "One of those relationships exists between Vince McAneney, the legendary former football football coach at Pennsauken High School, and Dwight Hicks, one of the school's most accomplished players."</ref> Before his pro career, Hicks played for the [[University of Michigan]].

==Professional football career==
Hicks started his professional football career with the CFL Toronto Argonauts in 1978 playing 3 games as defensive back and punt returner.

A four-time [[Pro Bowl]] selection from 1981 to 1984, Hicks was a key player on the 49ers dynasty in the 1980s, assisting his team to NFL Championship wins in [[Super Bowl XVI]] and [[Super Bowl XIX]].  In the 1981 season, Hicks led the NFL in interceptions (9) and return yards (239), and went on to make a big impact in the Super Bowl against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]].  After the 49ers lost a fumble on the opening kickoff, the Bengals had a great scoring opportunity and drove to San Francisco 5-yard line.  However, Hicks made a clutch interception to prevent the Bengals from scoring.  His interception set up a 49ers touchdown on their ensuing drive and helped San Francisco build up a 20-0 lead at halftime, eventually winning the game 26-21.

Hicks arrived with the 49ers merely by happenstance. Hicks was one of a bevy of defensive backs used by the 49ers during the 1979 and 1980 NFL seasons. Before being signed by the 49ers, [[John Facenda]] noted in a team highlight film that Hicks was "Managing a health food store" in Detroit. Hicks, who was interviewed for the [[America's Game]] episode focusing on the 49ers [[Super Bowl XIX]] champions, notes that Facenda was wrong. Hicks was simply working in the stock room of a health food store at the time of his signing. Only 25 years old, Hicks found himself suddenly the veteran leader of the 49ers secondary in the 1981 season, when the 49ers decided to rebuild their defensive backfield through the draft. Playing in only his second full season, Hicks was considered the leader of a secondary that also featured rookies [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Eric Wright]] and [[Carlton Williamson]]. The young, but hard-hitting secondary would affectionately be known as "Dwight Hicks and his Hot Licks".{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Despite this lack of experience, the 49ers defense ranked among the best in the NFL and spurred the 49ers on to a surprising victory in [[Super Bowl XVI]].

Hicks was the Defensive Captain of the 49ers team that won [[Super Bowl XIX]] following the 1984 NFL season. Following a last-minute defeat to the Washington Redskins in the [[1983<U+2013>84 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: Washington Redskins 24, San Francisco 49ers 21|1983 NFC Championship Game]], Hicks delivered an impassioned speech to his crestfallen teammates, asking them to "Remember the feeling." Buoyed by Hicks' speech, the 1984 49ers rampaged through the season, finishing with a 15-1 record and breezing through the playoffs en route to a 38-16 victory over the [[Miami Dolphins]] in the Super Bowl. Hicks, along with his defensive backfield mates Lott, Wright and Williamson, were all selected to the Pro Bowl that season, only the second time in NFL History that a single team's entire secondary was afforded the honor in a single season (the first being the 1976 Pittsburgh Steelers' secondary of Mel Blount, JT Thomas, Glen Edwards and Mike Wagner, all whom were named to and played in the 1977 Pro Bowl.)

In his eight NFL seasons, Hicks recorded 32 interceptions, 602 interception return yards, 14 fumble recoveries, 112 fumble return yards, and 4 touchdowns (3 interceptions, 1 fumble return).  He also gained 461 yards returning kickoffs and punts. His single CFL season with the Argonauts, he had 2 interceptions or zero returns yards.

After his football career, Hicks went on to become a popular [[character actor]] in films such as ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'', ''[[Jack (1996 film)|Jack]]'', ''[[Armageddon (film)|Armageddon]]'', and ''[[In the Mix (film)|In the Mix]]''. He also made appearances on various television shows, including ''[[How I Met Your Mother (TV Series)]]'',''[[ Castle (TV Series)]], ''[[Body of Proof (TV Series)]]'', ''[[Cold Case (TV Series)]]'', ''[[The Practice]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' and ''[[The O.C.]]''. He also co-hosted ''The Point After'', a local San Francisco TV program that aired immediately after 49ers Sunday broadcasts on KTVU.

Hicks married Dana Woods in October 2004.
