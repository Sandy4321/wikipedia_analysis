'''Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham'''<ref>There is no hyphen between the two surnames (as is the Scottish fashion) which were first joined together by Don Roberto's great-great-grandfather, [[Robert Graham of Gartmore]], in 1796 when he inherited the Cunninghame estate of Finlaystone in Renfrewshire from his cousin John, 15th and last Earl of Glencairn.</ref> ([[London]], 24 May 1852 &ndash; [[Buenos Aires]], 20 March 1936) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[politician]], [[writer]], [[journalist]] and [[adventurer]]. He was a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP); the first-ever [[socialist]] member of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]; a founder, and the first president, of the [[Scottish Labour Party (1888-1893)]]; a founder of the [[National Party of Scotland]] in 1928; and the first president of the [[Scottish National Party]] in 1934.

==Youth==
Cunninghame Graham was the eldest son of [[Major]] William Bontine <ref>The entail of Nicol Bontine of Ardoch disponing the estate to his cousin Robert Graham of Gartmore stated that the holder of Gartmore could not also hold Ardoch at the same time and required the holder of Ardoch to assume the name Bontine.  This led to the eldest son assuming the name Bontine during his father's lifetime and reverting to Cunninghame Graham with the Bontine as an additional forename upon succeeding to Gartmore.  Major Bontine, due to his illness, never reverted to Cunninghame Graham. The practice has become almost impossible in modern times though the current head of the Cunninghame Graham family, William Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham of Gartmore assumed the Bontine into the middle of his name upon the death of his father in 1996.</ref> of the Renfrew Militia and formerly a Cornet in the [[Scots Greys]] with whom he served in Ireland. His mother was Hon Anne Elizabeth Elphinstone-Fleeming, daughter of [[Admiral]] [[Charles Elphinstone-Fleeming]] of Cumbernauld <ref>She was thus a niece of both John, 12th Lord Elphinstone and Hon [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]], Governor of [[Bombay]] and author of an early History of [[India]]. Her brother [[John Elphinstone-Fleeming]], became the 14th [[Lord Elphinstone]] in 1860.</ref> and a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[noblewoman]] Do<U+00F1>a Catalina Paulina Alessandro de Jim<U+00E9>nez, (who, reputedly, along with her 2nd husband Admiral James Katon), heavily influenced Cunninghame Graham's upbringing. Thus the first language Cunninghame Graham learnt was his mother's maternal tongue, [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. He spent most of his childhood on the family [[Estate (house)|estate]] of [[Finlaystone]] in [[Renfrewshire]] and Ardoch in [[Dunbartonshire]], Scotland, with his younger brothers Charles and Malise.<ref>http://www.FinlaystoneHouse.com/history.htm</ref>

After being educated at [[Harrow School|Harrow]] [[Public school (UK)|public school]] in [[England]], Robert finished his education in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] before moving to [[Argentina]] to make his fortune [[cattle ranch]]ing. He became known as a great adventurer and [[gaucho]] there, and was affectionately known as '''Don Roberto'''. He also travelled in [[Morocco]] disguised as a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[sheikh]], prospected for [[gold]] in [[Spain]], befriended [[Buffalo Bill]] in [[Texas]], and taught fencing in [[Mexico City]], having travelled there by wagon train from San Antonio de Bexar with his young bride ''sic'' "Gabrielle Chidiock de la Balmondiere" a supposed half French half Chilean poet.<ref>In 1986, some 80 years after her death, it was discovered that she was really Caroline Horsfall (the daughter of a Ripon Doctor), who had repeatedly run away to the stage.  She and Don Roberto had, with the obvious connivance of his mother, the redoubtable Hon. Anne Elizabeth Bontine (a society hostess of some note), concocted a whole new identity for her to make her more acceptable to the family's social set.</ref>

==Convert to socialism==
After the death of his father in 1883 he reverted to the Cunninghame Graham surname. He returned to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and became interested in politics. He attended [[socialist]] meetings where he heard and met [[William Morris]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[H. M. Hyndman]], [[Keir Hardie]] and [[John Burns]]. Despite his wealthy origins, Graham was converted to socialism and he began to speak at public meetings. He was an impressive orator and was especially good at dealing with hecklers.

==Liberal Party MP==
Although a socialist, in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|1886 general election]] he stood as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] candididate at [[North West Lanarkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North West Lanarkshire]]. His election programme was extremely radical and called for:

*the abolition of the [[House of Lords]]
*[[universal suffrage]]
*the [[nationalisation]] of land, mines and other industries
*free school meals
*[[disestablishment]] of the [[Church of England]]
*Scottish [[Home Rule]]
*the establishment of an eight-hour-day

Supported by [[Liberalism|liberals]] and socialists, Graham defeated the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist Party]] candidate by 322 votes.  He had stood against the same candidate at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 general election]], in which he was defeated by over 1100 votes.

Robert Cunninghame Graham refused to accept the conventions of the [[British House of Commons]]. On September 12, 1887 he was suspended from parliament for making what was called a "disrespectful reference" to the [[House of Lords]]. He was the first MP ever to be suspended from the House of Commons for [[profanity|swearing]]; the word was [[damn]].  

Graham's main concerns in the House of Commons were the plight of the [[unemployed]] and the preservation of [[civil liberties]]. He complained about attempts in 1886 and 1887 by the police to prevent public meetings and [[free speech]]. He attended the protest demonstration in [[Trafalgar Square]] on November 13, 1887 that was broken up by the police and became known as [[Bloody Sunday 1887|Bloody Sunday]]. Graham was badly beaten during his arrest and taken to Bow Street Police Station, where his uncle, Col William Hope VC, attempted to post bail. Both Cunninghame Graham, who was defended by [[H. H. Asquith]], and [[John Burns]] were found guilty for their involvement in the demonstration and sentenced to six weeks imprisonment. 

When Graham was released from [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville prison]] he continued his campaign to improve the rights of working people and to curb their economic exploitation. He was suspended from the House of Commons in December, 1888 for protesting about the working conditions of chain makers.  His response to the Speaker of the House, "I never withdraw" was later used by [[George Bernard Shaw]] in "Arms and the Man".<ref>Notes to Captain Brassbound's Conversion: Sources of the Play, G B Shaw, August 1900</ref>

==Scottish independence and the Scottish Labour Party==
Graham was a strong supporter of [[Scottish independence]] and in 1886 had helped establish the [[Scottish Home Rule Association]], and while in the House of Commons made several attempts to persuade fellow MPs of the desirability of a [[Scottish parliament]]. On one occasion Graham joked that he wanted a "national parliament with the pleasure of knowing that the taxes were wasted in [[Edinburgh]] instead of [[London]]." 

While in the House of Commons Graham became increasingly more radical and went on to found the [[Scottish Labour Party (1888-1893)|Scottish Labour Party]] with [[Keir Hardie]]. Graham left the Liberal Party in 1892 to contest the general election in a new constituency as a Labour candidate.

He supported workers in their industrial disputes and was actively involved with [[Annie Besant]] and the Matchgirls Strike and the [[London Dock Strike of 1889|1889 Dockers' Strike]]. In July 1889 he attended the [[Marxist]] Congress of the [[Second International (politics)|Second International]] in Paris with James Keir Hardie, William Morris, [[Eleanor Marx]] and [[Edward Aveling]]. The following year he made a speech in [[Calais]] that was considered by the authorities to be so revolutionary that he was arrested and expelled from [[France]].

Graham was a supporter of the [[eight hour day]] and made several attempts to introduce a Bill on the subject. He made some progress with this in the summer of 1892 but he was unable to persuade the Conservative and Unionist government, headed by [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], to allocate time for the Bill to be fully debated. 

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1892|1892 general election]] Graham stood as the [[Scottish Parliamentary Labour Party]] candidate for [[Glasgow Camlachie (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Camlachie]]. He was defeated and this brought his parliamentary career to an end. He remained active in political circles though, and helped his colleague Keir Hardie establish the [[Independent Labour Party]] and to enter parliament as the MP for West Ham.

Graham retained a strong belief in Scottish home rule. He played an active part in the establishment of the [[National Party of Scotland]] (NPS) in 1928 and was elected the first ever president of the Scottish National Party in 1934. He was several times the [[Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association]] candidate for the [[Rector (academia)|Lord Rectorship]] of the [[University of Glasgow]], which he lost by only sixty-six votes in 1928 to [[Stanley Baldwin]] the then [[Prime Minister]].

==Author==
During his life Graham had a large number of books and articles published. Subject matter included history, biography, poetry, essays, politics, travel and seventeen collections of short stories or literary sketches. Titles include ''Father Archangel of Scotland'' (1896 in conjunction with his wife Gabriella),''Thirteen Stories'' (1900), ''Success'' (1902), ''Scottish Stories'' (1914) "Brought Forward" (1916) and ''Hope'' (1917) and ''Mirages'' (1936).  Biographies included: ''Hernando de Soto'' (1903),''Doughty Deeds'' (1925), a biography of his great-great-grandfather, [[Robert Graham of Gartmore]] and Portrait of a Dictator (1933). His great-niece and biographer, Jean, Lady Polwarth,<ref>Under her maiden name Jean Cunninghame Graham she published in 2004 a biography entitled ''Gaucho Laird'' based on his letters and writings</ref> published a collection of his short stories (or sketches) entitled  ''Beattock for Moffatt and the Best of Cunninghame Graham'' (1979) and Alexander Maitland added his selection under the title ''Tales of Horsemen'' (1981). Professor John Walker published collections of Cunninghame Graham's South American Sketches (1978), Scottish Sketches (1982) and North American Sketches (1986) and Kennedy & Boyd are republishing the stories and sketches in five volumes.  In 1988 The Century Travellers reprinted his ''Mogreb-el-Acksa'' (1898) and ''A Vanished Arcadia'' (1901), the latter being, in part, the inspiration for the award-winning film ''[[The Mission (1986 film)|The Mission]]''.  More recently The Long Riders Guild Press have reprinted his equestrian travel works in their Cunninghame Graham Collection and Kessinger Publishing have reprinted some 16 titles to date.  

He helped [[Joseph Conrad]], whom he had introduced to his publisher [[Edward Garnett]] at [[Gerald Duckworth and Company|Duckworth]] with research for ''[[Nostromo]]''.  Other literary friends included, [[Ford Madox Ford]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[W. H. Hudson]], [[George Bernard Shaw]] (who openly admits his debt to Graham for "[[Captain Brassbound's Conversion]]" as well as a key line in "[[Arms and the Man]]") and [[G. K. Chesterton]], who proclaimed him "The Prince of Preface Writers" and famously declared in his autobiography that while Cunninghame Graham would never be allowed to be Prime Minister, he instead "achieved the adventure of being Cunninghame Graham", which Shaw described as "an achievement so fantastic that it would never be believed in a romance."

==Cunninghame Graham in Art==
Cunninghame Graham was a staunch supporter of the artists of his day and a popular subject. He sat for artists such as Sir [[William Rothenstein]], who painted Don Roberto as ''The Fencer'';<ref>In the Dunedin Art Gallery, New Zealand</ref> Sir [[John Lavery]] whose famous ''Don Roberto: Commander for the King of Aragon in the Two Sicilies'' for many years graced the cover of the Penguin Books edition of Conrad's Nostromo <ref>In Glasgow City Art Gallery</ref> and whose equestrian portrait of Don Roberto on his favourite horse ''Pampa'';<ref>In the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Buenos Aires</ref> G. P. Jacomb-Hood who painted his official portrait on entering parliament,<ref>Now in the possession of W R B Cunninghame Graham of Gartmore</ref> who along with Whistler were personal friends. [[George Washington Lambert]] painted him in oil with his horse Pinto and [[James McBey]] portrayed him in old age. There are also busts by Weiss and [[Jacob Epstein]]. The Dumbarton born artist, [[William Strang]], used Cunninghame Graham as the model for his series of etchings of Don Quixote.  It is unsurprising that he was at the mercy of cartoonists such as [[Tom Merry]] who portrayed him in prison garb and caricaturists such as Max and Spy.

== Final Years==

Robert Cunninghame Graham remained sprightly and rode daily even in his 80s.  He continued to write, and held the office of President of the Scottish Branch of the P.E.N. Club,<ref>His friends [[John Galsworthy]] and [[H.G. Wells]] were the English and International Presidents respectively</ref> and involve himself in politics.  He died from pneumonia on March 20, 1936 in the Plaza Hotel in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina following a visit to the birthplace of his friend [[William Henry Hudson|William Hudson]]. He lay in state in the Casa del Teatro <ref>Formerly the Cervantes Theatre</ref> and received a countrywide tribute led by the President of the Republic <ref>There is a street in Buenos Aires named in his honour (R. Cunningham Graham)as is the hamlet of Don Roberto in the Province of Entre Rios.</ref>  before his body was shipped home to be buried beside his wife in the ruined [[Augustinian]] [[Inchmahome Priory|Priory]] on the island of [[Inchmahome]], [[Lake of Menteith]], [[Stirling]]. The following year, June 1937, a monument, the [[Cunninghame Graham Memorial]], was unveiled at [[Castlehill, Dumbarton|Castlehill]], [[Dumbarton]], near the family home at [[Ardoch, Dunbartonshire|Ardoch]]. Later it was moved to [[Gartmore]], closer to the principal Graham estate, which he had been forced to sell in 1901 to the shipping magnate and founder of the Clan Line, [[Sir Charles Cayzer, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Cayzer, Bt]].  His estates at Ardoch passed to his nephew, Captain (later Admiral Sir) [[Angus Cunninghame Graham]], the only son of his brother Cdr. Charles Elphinstone-Fleeming Cunninghame Graham, MVO.
