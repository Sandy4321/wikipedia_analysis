'''New York State Route&nbsp;108''' ('''NY&nbsp;108''') is a {{convert|1.72|mi|2|sing=on}} long north<U+2013>south [[state highway]] located on the [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] side of the Suffolk<U+2013>[[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] county line on [[Long Island]], [[New York]], in the United States. It is a spur route connecting [[New York State Route 25A|NY&nbsp;25A]] in [[Cold Spring Harbor, New York|Cold Spring Harbor]] to the [[Cold Spring Harbor (LIRR station)|Cold Spring Harbor station]] on the [[Long Island Rail Road]]'s [[Port Jefferson Branch]] by way of Harbor Road. State maintenance of Harbor Road terminates at the Nassau County line, and the road continues into Nassau County as Woodbury Road ([[County Route 12 (Nassau County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;12]] or CR&nbsp;12, an [[unsigned highway|unsigned]] route). NY&nbsp;108, assigned in the early 1930s, is the shortest state highway on Long Island.

==Route description==
[[File:New York State Route 108's southern terminus and County Route&nbsp;11's missigned terminus.jpg|left|thumb|Route&nbsp;108 at its southern terminus in Cold Spring Harbor facing westbound on County Route&nbsp;11]]
NY&nbsp;108 begins at the [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] line in the community of [[Cold Spring Harbor, New York|Cold Spring Harbor]], where it connects to Woodbury Road (unsigned [[County Route 12 (Nassau County, New York)|CR&nbsp;12]]), and immediately intersects [[County Route 11 (Suffolk County, New York)|CR&nbsp;11]] (Pulaski Road). The road, named Harbor Road, passes to the north of the [[Long Island Rail Road]]'s [[Cold Spring Harbor (LIRR station)|Cold Spring Harbor station]] and runs along the Nassau&ndash;Suffolk county line. The route heads northward through a small residential neighborhood. At the intersection with Stillwell Lane, NY&nbsp;108 southbound crosses into Nassau County, but soon curves away back into Suffolk. Soon after, the two-lane road continues into [[Trail View State Park]], where the route becomes desolate, passing two local ponds. A short distance later, NY&nbsp;108 enters a small region of houses and intersects with Lawrence Hill Road. At the intersection with Lawrence Hill, NY&nbsp;108 turns westward and terminates at an intersection with [[New York State Route 25A|NY&nbsp;25A]] (North Hempstead Turnpike) in Cold Spring Harbor.<ref name="bing">{{bing maps |title=overview map of NY 108 |accessdate=December 24, 2009 |url=http://www.maps.bing.com/maps/?FORM=Z9LH7#JmNwPTQwLjg0NzMzMDI0MjM5NTM5NH4tNzMuNDU3MTA5NDQzODQzMzYmbHZsPTE0JnN0eT1yJnJ0cD1wb3MuNDAuODU4NDAxMDYwMTA0MzdfLTczLjQ2MTkwOTU5MjE1MTY0X1NSJTIwMjVBJTJDJTIwQ29sZCUyMFNwcmluZyUyMEhhcmJvciUyQyUyME5ZJTIwMTE3MjRfX19lX35wb3MuNDAuODM3MzAwNzkyMzM2NDY0Xy03My40NTIzMDkyOTU1MzUwOV9MaXJyLUNvbGQlMjBTcHJpbmclMjBIYXJib3IlMkMlMjBOWV9fX2VfJnJ0b3A9MH4wfjB+}}</ref>

==History==
Harbor Road was improved to state highway standards as part of a project contracted out by the state of [[New York]] on September&nbsp;4, 1919. A total of {{convert|5.86|mi}} of highway were rebuilt as part of the $205,500 project (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|205500|1921|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}), including the westernmost {{convert|4.5|mi}} of modern [[New York State Route 25A|NY&nbsp;25A]] in [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]]. The roads reconstructed as part of the project were added to the state highway system on January&nbsp;11, 1921, as [[unsigned highway|unsigned]] State Highway&nbsp;1525 (SH&nbsp;1525).<ref name="1922book">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lhlbAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA78 |author=State of New York Commission of Highways |title=Tables Giving Detailed Information and Present Status of All State, County and Federal Aid Highways |year=1922 |publisher=J.
