'''Andrew Boyens''' (born 18 September 1983 in [[Dunedin]]) is a [[New Zealand]] [[Association football|footballer]] who currently plays for [[New York Red Bulls]] in [[Major League Soccer]], and has represented [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] at international level.<ref name="aapp" />

==Career==
===College===
Boyens started his playing career in New Zealand, playing for [[Otago University]] and amateur club [[Dunedin Technical]] before transferring to [[University of New Mexico]] in 2004, where he was named a [[Division I First-Team All-American (soccer)|first-team All-American]] in 2006.

===Professional===
After briefly playing for [[Otago United]] in the [[New Zealand Football Championship]], Boyens was drafted in the first round of the [[2007 MLS SuperDraft]] by [[Toronto FC]]. He scored his first MLS goal off a corner in a 2-1 win over the [[Colorado Rapids]] on June 2, 2007. He was released by Toronto FC on April 14, 2008.

Boyens went on trial at [[Red Bull New York]] in April 2008<ref>[http://www.soccerbyives.net/soccer_by_ives/2008/04/red-bulls-upd-5.html Soccer By Ives: Red Bulls Update: Reyna, Freeman and Richards train, Boyens trials and Leitch looks to rebound<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, and signed with the team on May 5, 2008.<ref>[http://www.soccerbyives.net/soccer_by_ives/2008/05/red-bulls-sign.html Soccer By Ives: Red Bulls sign Andrew Boyens<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He appeared in 19 matches during the MLS regular season. After an up and down season Boyens' solid play in central defense helped the Red Bulls pull off a surprising first-round upset in the MLS playoffs, defeating defending champion [[Houston Dynamo]] 4-1 on aggregate.

===International===

Boyens was included in the [[New Zealand national soccer team|New Zealand]] squad for a series of matches against [[Malaysia]] in February 2006, but did not play in any of them. He made his national team debut in an unofficial friendly later that year, when he came on as a substitute during [[New Zealand national soccer team|New Zealand]]<U+2019>s 5-1 loss to Spanish club [[Sevilla FC]] on August 15.

Boyens' first official international appearance came in May 2007, when New Zealand drew with [[Wales]] 2-2.<ref name="aapp">{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatenzsoccer.com/NZRepSoccer/id1708.htm|title=A-International Appearances - Overall|author=|publisher=The Ultimate New Zealand Soccer Website|date=|accessdate=2008-07-25}}</ref> [[The Observer]] noted that the defensive back two pairing of Boyens and [[Ben Sigmund]] were "''boasting 10 minutes international experience between them''". 

He was named in the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]] New Zealand squad, and gifted [[David Villa]] Spain's fifth goal when he "air shot" a routine clearance during Spain's 5-0 rout over New Zealand on Sunday June 14.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oceaniafootball.com/ofcnewsdetails/new-zealand---all-whites-name-squad-for-fifa-confederations-cup|title=New Zealand - All Whites name Confederations Cup squad|author=|publisher=Oceania Football confederation|date=7 May 2009|accessdate=}}</ref>
