[[Image:FlagofAssyria.svg|thumb|300px|The flag of the Assyrian independence movement.]]
'''Assyrian independence''' is a [[political movement]] and [[ideology]] that supports the creation of an [[Assyrian homeland]] for the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]-speaking [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Assyrian people]] in Northern [[Iraq]].  The issue of Assyrian independence has been brought up many times throughout the course of history from the end of [[World War I]] to the present-day [[Iraq War]].  Traditionally, the Assyrian-inhabited area of Iraq is located in the [[Ninawa Governorate|Ninawa]]-[[Mosul]] region in Northern Iraq where the biblical Assyrian capital of [[Nineveh]] was located <ref>Minorities in the Middle East: a history of struggle and self-expression By Mordechai Nisan</ref>.  This area eventually became known as the "Assyrian Triangle." <ref>The Origins of War: From the Stone Age to Alexander the Great By Arther Ferrill - Page 70</ref>

==World War I and genocide==
{{main|Assyrian Genocide}}
Before [[World War I]], about half of the Assyrian population lived in what is today [[Turkey]], specifally the [[Hakkari]] region.  In 1914, [[Young Turks]] began to systemically target Christians of [[Asia Minor]] with events such as the [[Assyrian Genocide]].  In the beginning, key Assyrian nationalist leaders and religious figures were wiped out of communities, where as at one point the [[Patriarch]] of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] was only 12 years old ([[Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII]].) <ref>The Forgotten Genocide: Eastern Christians, the Last Assyrians By S<U+00E9>bastien de Courtois</ref>

The [[Ottoman Empire]] declared war against the [[Allies]] and the [[Britain|British]] On October of 1914. For geographic reasons, it was important for the [[United Kingdom|British]] to gain the support of the [[Assyrians]]. 

Because of large oil fields, Britain wanted to insure that the [[Mosul]] region would be part of the new colonized Iraq instead of the future state of [[Turkey]].  The [[Assyrians]] promised loyalty to the British in return for an independent state in the future.  After the invasion of Mosul by Young Turks, the Assyrian army led by general [[Agha Petros]], fought intensively against the Turks and pushed them out of the region, leading to Britain<U+2019>s control of the region. The battles are described in detail by [http://www.assyrianlevies.com/gpage1.html surviving letters] of Petros and Britain officials. 

By the end of 1922, no sufficient Assyrian population was left in Turkey and a small population 
left in Iran.  Many fled southward to join native Assyrians in the Nineveh plains.

The Assyro-Chaldean National Council stated in a December 4, 1922, memorandum that the total death toll is unknown, but it estimates that about 275,000 "Assyro-Chaldeans" died between 1914<U+2013>1918.<ref name = "Yacoub">Joseph Yacoub, La question assyro-chald<U+00E9>enne, les Puissances europ<U+00E9>ennes et la SDN (1908<U+2013>1938), 4 vol., th<U+00E8>se Lyon, 1985, p. 156.</ref>

==Conferences and treaties==
===Paris Peace Conference===

In 1919, the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] Bishop Mor Afram Barsom wrote a letter on behalf of the Assyrians to the [[League of Nations]]. (See the [http://www.bethsuryoyo.com/images/Articles/AframBarsom/AfBarsom7.html original letter] and a [http://www.bethsuryoyo.com/images/Articles/AframBarsom/AfBarsom6.html revised clearer version].)

In the letter the Bishop wrote that 90,000 Assyrians had been massacred by the Turks. He also said  that the Assyrian people were against the proposed autonomy of the Kurds. The letter convinced France to allow Assyrian representation during the upcoming peace conference. <ref>The Paris Peace Conference, 1919: Peace Without Victory?</ref>

[[Image:Assyrianfighter.JPG|thumb|Assyrian fighter during the 1890s belonging to the [[Tyari]] tribe.]]
Three Assyrian groups were scheduled to participate in the Peace Conference: Assyrian delegates from the [[United States]], [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]].

The Assyrian group from Iran arrived in France first. The British, having no authority in Iran and fearing the presence of a group which it could not control, forced the Iranian Assyrian delegation  to leave Paris and not participate.

Then the Assyrian delegates from the United States arrived. Their demands included the establishment of an Assyrian independent territory which would include Northern Bet-Nahren, beginning at the lower [[Zab River]] [[Diyarbak<U+0131>r|Diyar Bakir]] and extending to the Armenian mountains, and that the territory would be under the protection of the [[superpowers]].

U.S delegate Rev. Joel Werda in his petition concluded;

{{cquote|We have the most conclusive proofs to show that the Assyrians were urged by the official representatives of Great Britain, France and Russia, to enter into the war on the side of the Allies . . . with the most solemn promises of being given a free state.  The Assyrians, therefore, having risked the very existence of their nation, and having made such appalling sacrifices upon the altar of freedom, demand that these promises of the Allied governments now be honorably redeemed <ref>Balfour to FO, Paris, 31.7.1919</ref>.}}

Great Britain and the U.S. delegates denied this petition, explaining that the U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] had strong reservations concerning any plans to divide Turkey. The American Assyrian delegation returned from the conference empty handed.

The Assyrian delegates from Iraq, after many delays by the British authorities, were approved to travel to Paris on July 21st on one condition, that they pass through [[London]], [[England]] first.  Surma Khanim, the head of the delegation was kept in London until the conference of France finished its deliberations. His demands had been to allow the Assyrians to return to [[Hakkari Province|Hakk<U+00E2>ri]], that they be accorded equal rights, that all Assyrian prisoners be released, and that the individuals responsible for the atrocities committed against the Assyrians be punished.

=== Treaty of S<U+00E8>vres===
This treaty, signed on August 10, 1920, between Great Britain, Allies and Turkey, laid the foundations for the new Turkish frontier after World War I <ref>the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] and the Associated Powers were the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Italy]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] (Principal Allied Powers), [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Belgium]], [[Democratic Republic of Armenia|Armenia]], [[Kingdom of Hejaz|the Hejaz]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslavia)]] and [[Czechoslovakia|Czecho-Slovakia]]</ref>. Assyrians were not permitted by Great Britain to participate in these deliberations under the rule that the Assyrians were not an equal power with the rest of the participants.  But the Assyrian issue was discussed and the plan was to contain full safeguards for the protection of the Assyro-Chaldeans and other racial or religious minorities under articles 62, 63, 140, 141, 142, 147, 148, 149, and 150. As a result of this treaty, [[Mosul]] (Nineveh) was given to Iraq while France was guaranteed 25% of Mosul's oil production.

Article 62 of the Treaty states:

{{cquote|... this plan must provide complete guarantees as to the protection of the Assyro-Chaldeans and other ethnic or religious minorities in this area.  To this end, a commission made up of British, French, [[Italy|Italian]], [[Iran|Persian]] and [[Kurd]]ish representatives will visit the area so as to determine what adjustments, if any, should be made to the Turkish frontier wherever it coincides with Persian frontier as laid down in this treaty.}}

===Treaty of Lausanne===
[[Image:OaklandTribune 1922.jpg|thumb|300px|''Assyro-Chaldean soldiers who are ready to fight for independence'' - [[Oakland Tribune]], February 11, 1923]]
November 20, 1922
The [[Treaty of Lausanne]], signed on July 24, 1923, between the Allied powers and Turkey, was composed after Turkey requested that the issue of [[Mosul]] (Nineveh) be re-examined.  Assyrians once again were not allowed to participate as Great Britain stood in the way, but again they were promised that their rights will be protected. It is worth mentioning that Agha Petros, General of the Assyrian Army, attended the opening ceremonies.  The United States stood with Great Britain in these deliberations, the latter promising 20% of the oil industry business  be awarded to American companies.  Turkey lost its appeal to win Mosul (Nineveh) back based on Great Britain's claims that this region will be saved for the future settlement of the Kurdish and Assyrian people, but no final agreement was reached. <ref>The Legal Regime of the Turkish Straits By Nihan Unlu, Nihan <U+00DC>nl<U+00FC> - Page 32</ref>

Article 39 of the treaty states:

{{cquote|There will be no official restriction on any Turkish citizen<U+2019>s right to use any language he wishes, whether in private, in commercial dealings, in matter of religion, in print or at a public gathering. Regardless of the existence of an official language, appropriate facilities will be provided for any non-Turkish-speaking citizen of Turkey to use his own language before the court.}}

===The Constantinople Conference===
The Constantinople Conference was between Great Britain and Turkey, May 21, 1924
The Assyrians were told that Britain is "fighting" their case for them and that there is no need for them to attend.  A letter on behalf of the Assyrians and their settlement was written under the direction of Sir Henry Conway Dobbs, the British High Commissioner in Iraq, under "Statement of Proposals for the Settlement of the Assyrian People in Iraq", in that regard. <ref>Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide - Page 149 by Bat Yeor, Miriam Kochan, David Littman</ref>

The government of Turkey claimed Mosul (Nineveh) as part of Turkey, and Fet<U+2019>hi Beg declared that the Assyrians, who he referred to as Nestorians, are welcome to live in their previous lands in Turkey where they will find freedom.  Sir Percy Cox, stated that Mosul (Nineveh) belongs to Iraq and that the Christian Assyrians need protection from Turkey.

This was part of his statement:

{{cquote|...His Majesty<U+2019>s Government has decided to endeavor to secure a good treaty frontier, which will at the same time admit of the establishment of the Assyrians in a compact community within the limits of the territory in respect of which His Majesty<U+2019>s Government hold a mandate under the authority of the League of Nations, if not in every case in their ancestral habitation, at all events in suitable adjacent districts.  This policy for the settlement of the Assyrians has the full sympathy and support of the Iraqi Government, which is prepared for its part, to give the necessary cooperation for giving effect thereto.}}<ref>[http://www.nineveh.com/whoarewe.htm Assyrians information Nineveh]</ref>

No agreement was reached at the end.  Turkey then massed its troops on the border to occupy the Mosul (Nineveh) Province by force.  The Assyrian Levy Force of 2000 was sent north to protect Iraq, since the Iraqi army at this time was unfit to undertake such task.  The Assyrian force was largely responsible for the annexation of Mosul (Nineveh) to Iraq rather than to Turkey, as an official of the League of Nations stated.

==Recommendation of League of Nations==
June 16, 1925
The Commission presented its findings. It recommended that the Assyrian people receive full protection if they were to return to Turkey, that they be given their freedom, and that they receive reimbursements for all their loses during  World War I. <Ref> League of Nations Documents and Serial Publications, 1919-1946 [microformguides.gale.com/Data/Download/3028000R.pdf]</ref> The Commission further recommended  the Patriarch, Mar Eshai Shimunbe, be given full authority over his people.

These recommendations were not approved. It was finally decided that the issue be referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague, an integral part of the charter of the League of Nations. This court was later replaced by the International Court of Justice after the birth of the United Nations.

===The Hague September===
In 1925 the Permanent Court of International Justice took over the disputed border line issue and in December 1925, adopted a resolution which refused the idea of the Assyrian's return to Hakk<U+00E2>ri and gave that region to Turkey, while giving Mosul (Nineveh) to Iraq and settling on a border line almost matching the same status quo line which was called the Brussels Line. Further, it recommended the continuation of the British mandate on [[Iraq]] for another 25 years to safeguard the Assyrian interests. <ref>Recueil des cours - Page 39 by Hague Academy of International Law</ref>

===Assyrian human rights ===
On November 11, 1927, the [[Assyrians]] continued to protest  their mistreatment and continued to send letters to the League of Nations, requesting a report from both the governments of [[Britain]] and Iraq about the situation.  The Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague did not accept the reports of Britain and [[Iraq]] and requested that both countries to fulfill their obligations towards the Assyrians. At the same time some [[Assyrians]] are not considered full citizens of the country. In 1992-93 all [[Assyrian]] teachers and professors who had previous Ottoman nationality were forced to retire. One family was deported to Istanbul, [[Turkey]]. During the Iran-Iraq war, some Assyrians whose families originated from Assyrian villages in Iran were facing difficult times. <ref>[http://www.aina.org/reports/ahrr.htm Assyrian Human Rights Report]</ref>

==British Treaties and Assyrian Petitions==
[[Image:Assyriatriangle.JPG|thumb|250ppx|The Assyrian triangle]]
[[Britain]] dropped the earlier established recommendations by the Mandate Commission on the grounds that those recommendations should be directed to the [[Turkish]] Government and not the Iraqi government, Assyrians from the Hakk<U+00E2>ri and Tur Abdin originally, escaped and have no intentions of returning to Turkey.  Hence, they should occupy the land the Iraqi government has provided for them.

Several treaties were signed and ratified between Britain and Iraq in the next two years in what seemed to be Britain<U+2019>s preparations to clear the way for Iraq to enter the League of Nations.

Three petitions were received by the Mandate Commission stressing the fears of the Assyrians regarding the termination of the Mandate; they were dated in September [[1931]], [[October 20]], 1931 and [[October 23]], 1931.  One was rejected by Sir Francis Humphrys on the grounds that it was submitted by a person not qualified to represent the Assyrians. Humphrys still pledged the moral responsibility of Great Britain to the future attitude of the Iraqi government.

The October 23, 1931 petition was submitted by His Holiness Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII, in Mosul (Nineveh), asking for permission to allow the Assyrians to leave Iraq before the end of the Mandate, stating that it would be impossible for the Assyrians to live in Iraq.  This decision was reached at with the agreement of all the Assyrian leaders and when responses to this petition were delayed, the [[Assyrians]] decided to take action and planned for a general <U+2018>cessation of service<U+2019> by all the Levies.

The Mandate Commission reviewed the Assyrian petition and was still not satisfied with Britain and Iraq<U+2019>s assurances of protection of Minorities.  Worth mentioning here that Sir Humphrys was accused by his own fellow British officials to fabricate lies in regards to the Iraqi government<U+2019>s sentiments about the Assyrians.

The Mandate Commission gave its recommendations, stating that they are concerned about the Christians, and accordingly, average people were given the right to submit any petitions to the League of Nations, directly, in the future.

In partial compliance with requests of the petition, the Iraqi government set up a further land-finding committee.   It discovered but little land both cultivable and available.  In fact, they found malaria-ridden, swampy lands, and in their usual obnoxious style, recommended expenditure on an irrigation scheme to produce more.  Hundreds upon hundreds of Assyrians died with malaria in those lands.

The Council of the League of Nations accepted the recommendations and Iraq issued a declaration guaranteeing the protection of minorities on May 30, 1932.

Accordingly Iraq was accepted in the League of Nations on [[October 3]], 1932.<ref>The Admission of Iraq to Membership in the League of Nations

==The Assyrian massacre in Iraq==
{{main|Simele massacre}}
The Assyrian national question was taken to Geneva by the Assyrian Patriarch [[Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII]] again when he addressed the Permanent Mandate Commission meeting and urged the Council to fulfill its obligations toward the Assyrian Nation.  The League yet again granted the Assyrians their rights of homogenous community in Iraq with a local autonomy. 

Mar Eshai Shimum was quoted in the meeting: 
:"If the (British) mandaite is lifted without effective guarantees for our protection in the future, our extermination would follow"

After the establishment of the kingdom of Iraq in 1932, an Assyrian uprising followed through the following year, refusing to sign a declaration of loyalty to King Faisal and agree not to thwart the scheme of the League of Nations for the settlement of the Assyrians, was deported by the order of the government on [[August 18]], 1933 and deprived of Iraqi nationality.

The failed uprising led to the massacre of 3,000 Assyrians throughout northern Iraq. 
The biggest massacre was in the village of [[Sumail|Simele]]. Eyewitness wrote numerous books about the events. <ref>Assyrians of Eastern Massachusetts - Page 66 by Sargon Donabed, Ninos Donabed</ref>

The Levies alarmed by this and the imminent withdrawal of British troops, decide upon a concentration of all Assyrians in the [[Amadia]] area for security. All Assyrian officers jointly presented a manifesto on the [[July 16]] to the commanding officer requesting discharge within 30 days. The other ranks also followed the lead of their officers. The British feared if this were allowed to happen they would loose all authority in Iraq. To buy time, they decided to allow discharge over a four month period. A British battalion was flown in from Egypt when discharges commenced. After negotiations with Assyrian leaders, the Levies withdrew their request and the British battalion was withdrawn. In all 296 were discharged. No Iraqi was held responsible for the massacre. A large number of Assyrians began to flee Iraq and find safety in Syria, under French control at the time.  The Transport and machine gun Assyrian companies ceased to exist as separate units, both being divided between the two Assyrian battalions. Kirkuk was occupied by a platoon from the 2nd battalion to guard the Wireless and other RAF stores.  
Due to the events of 1933, Assyrians mark [[August 7]] as their martyrs day.

==Mar Eshai Shimun in Geneva with Yousuf Malik==
After the Simele massacre the Council of the League of Nations was absolutely sure that the Assyrian issue was still an unsolved problem.  The Assyrian Patriarch requested the League to form an Assyrian and Kurdish enclave in the north of the province of Mosul (Nineveh) under a special administration.  The Patriarch reminded the Council about the plan originally suggested by Lord Curzon, the British Foreign Minister, on [[December 17]] 1919.   

In Iraq Rashid Ali Al-Gailani, the Iraqi Prime Minister, announced that the Assyrians should find a new home outside Iraq and promised that the Iraqi government was willing to make very generous contributions to cover any expenses of such settlement.   On [[October 13]] 1933, the League of Nations appointed a committee of six of its members to look into this possibility.  

On [[October 24]], the Assyrians submitted another petition by Yousuf Malik, an Assyrian Nationalist from Iraq who was exiled to [[Lebanon]] and who moved between [[Cyprus]], [[Beirut]] and [[Damascus]] exposing what was going on inside Iraq and the British games.  This petition gives the details of many cases of oppression against the Assyrians in Iraq, details on hardships from government officials, and the facts about the Semele massacre.

From October 1933 to June 1935 the committee of six looked into many options, they covered [[Brazil]], [[British Guiana]], [[Niger]] and they all failed.  A further suggestion that the British [[Red Cross]] might send a relief party to Mosul (Nineveh) was also objected to, apparently on the grounds that this would discourage the activities of the Iraqi Crescent, which has not carried out any relief work among the Assyrians. In September 1935, the plan of settling of some of the Assyrians in the Khabour and Ghab areas in Syria was approved.  History shows that the plan was never followed up so it too has failed.

Things did not change for the Assyrians in Iraq until the outbreak of World War II, when the Iraqis revolted under Rashid Ali Al-Gailani who sided himself with Germany and wanted to force the British out of Iraq completely.  The faith of the British existence in Iraq hanged in the hands of the 1500 Assyrian Levis ability to hold the British Air Force Base in Habbaniya against the Rebels of over 60,000 Arab tribesmen and regular troops who surrounded the base. 

The Battle of Habbaniya is well described in the book, "[[The Golden Carpet]]" by [[Somerset De Chair]], a British intelligence officer served in Iraq during W.W.II.

==Possibility for Assyrian independence in the post-World War II era==

With the end of [[World War II]] and with the eventual creation of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in [[1948]], the call for an Assyrian homeland grew greater.

===Mar Eshai Shimun at the United Nations===

[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.svg|25x15px]]
The [[United Nations]] was born in [[San Francisco]] (replacing the [[League of Nations]]).

The [[Assyria]]n Patriarch, [[Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII]], was there to present the [[Assyria]]n petition to the new world body of peace and was accompanied by two members of the [[Assyria]]n National Federation.  In this petition the Assyrian tragedy was explained from World War I until the end of World War II.

Several petitions from the Patriarch in 1945 and 1946 were sent to the Secretary General of the United Nations to look into the Assyrian National Question.  A letter from the UN General Secretary # 1100-1-4/MEJ dated Oct. 7, 1946 was received by Mar Shimun stating that he had referred the Patriarch<U+2019>s petition to the Commission on Human Rights.

===Petition to the UN General Secretary about Assyrian Massacres in Iran===

A petition concerning the Assyrian Massacres in Iran was filed again by [[Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII]], Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East.  Mar Eshai struggled for over a half century at the League of Nations, then the [[United Nations]].  None of his petitions were taken seriously. <ref>The League of Nations in Retrospect: Proceedings of the Symposium - Page 376 by United Nations Library - 1983</ref>

==Assyrians in the Republic of Iraq==
Inspired by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], officers from the Nineteenth Brigade known as "Free Officers", under the leadership of Brigadier [[Abdul-Karim Qassem]] and Colonel [[Abdul Salam Arif]] overthrew the Hashimite monarchy on [[14 July]] [[1958]].  

The overthrow of Iraq's monarchy instilled new hope for the Assyrian cause.  However, this hope was short-lived. Qassem was assassinated in February [[1963]], throwing Iraq into a period of political uncertainty.  Out of the chaos emerged the [[Baath Party|Ba'ath Party]] who promptly took control of Iraq's government.  

The Ba'athist brought promise to Iraq and the Assyrian cause when the new government recognized the cultural rights of Syriac-speaking citizens (Assyrians, Chaldeans and members of the East Syrian Church) in [[1972]]. Syriac was to be the language used at all primary schools where the majority of pupils spoke that language in addition to Arabic. Syriac was also to be taught at intermediate and secondary schools where the majority of students spoke that language in addition to Arabic. Special programs in Syriac were to be broadcast on public radio and television and three Syriac-language magazines were to be published. An Association of Syriac-Speaking Authors and Writers was also been established. <ref>[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/CERD.C.240.Add.3.En?OpenDocument Twelfth periodic reports of States parties due in 1993 : Iraq. 14/06/96, Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (the Iraqi government's point of view]</ref>

Still, no autonomy was granted to the Assyrians.  However, movements towards autonomy and independence remained active.  In [[1968]] a new [[Assyrian flag]] was introduced and adopted by the Assyrian Congress in [[Teheran]]. In [[1977]] the Assyrian Provisional Government, headquartered from the [[Assyrian diaspora]] in the [[United States]] in [[Chicago]], chartered a constitution for an Autonomous Assyrian State.  The Assyrians now had their goal set and would maintain it.

However, when [[Saddam Hussein]] rose to power, things began to change for the Assyrians in Iraq.  Assyrians were deprived of their cultural and national rights while at the same time the Ba'athist regime tried to co-opt their history.  The 1972 proclomation was reversed and Hussein began a strict campaign of [[Arabization]] on any non-Arabs in Iraq, including Assyrians as well as other groups such as Kurds, Iraqi Turkmen, and Armenians.  During the [[Iran-Iraq War]], many Assyrians were recruited to the armies of both sides. This resulted in Assyrians in Iraq killing Assyrians in Iran.  It was estimated that 60,000 Assyrians were killed during the conflict.

When Hussein first assumed power, the Assyrian population in Iraq numbered 2 million to 2.5 million.  Due to both persecution by his regime and subsequent emigration to [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], and [[Lebanon]], that number began to decline drastically.

==Post-Ba'thist Iraq==
[[Image:Autonomy2003.JPG|thumb|250ppx|Firas Jatou's results of his teams study of remaining Assyrian villages]]

With the fall of Saddam Hussein and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], no reliable census figures exist on the Assyrians in Iraq (as they do not for Kurds or [[Iraqi Turkmen]]), though the number of Assyrians is estimated to be approximately 800,000.  

The [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] (or ADM) was one of the smaller political parties that emerged in the social chaos of the occupation. Its officials say that while members of the ADM also took part in the liberation of the key oil cities of Kirkuk and Mosul in the north, the Assyrians were not invited to join the steering committee that was charged with defining Iraq's future. The ethnic make-up of the [[Iraq Interim Governing Council]] briefly (September 2003 - June 2004) guiding Iraq after the invasion included a single Assyrian Christian, [[Younadem Kana]], a leader of the Assyrian Democratic Movement and an opponent of Saddam Hussein since [[1979]].  

Today, the Western media has a strong tendency to acknowledge only three major groups in Iraq: Sunni Arabs, Shi'a Arabs and Kurds. The [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish Autonomous Region]] has claimed that it has been instrumental in the renovation and support of Assyrian churches and schools.

===Assyrian Convention Addresses Assyrian Autonomy===
[[Image:Assyrianfighters80.JPG|thumb|250ppx|Assyrian militia loyal to [[Assyrian Democratic Movement|ADM]], in the 1980s.]]

The panel discussion entitled "Focus on Iraq" on August 30 featured Assyrian politicans and activist from Iraq and the U.S., which was held in Chicago. 
Mr. Willis Fautre's (from [[Human Rights Without Frontiers]]) model, two overlapping forms of federalism are envisioned.  First, the nation would have separate administrative "regions," each with its own parliament; a form of territorial federalism.  Each community (Assyrians, Turkman, Arabs, and Kurds) would also have their own parliament representing their communities throughout the country; a form of community federalism.  The community parliament would have full autonomy in religion, culture, schools, agriculture, energy, and protection of monuments.  The unity of the federal government would be guaranteed by a bicameral system with a House of Representatives elected directly by the people and a Senate appointed by the various communities.  For legislation affecting linguistic, cultural, or religious rights, both houses of parliament would have to pass the bill.  In addition, though, in the community-based Senate, a super-majority (e.g. 2/3) vote would be needed in addition to a simple majority of every represented community.  In such a way, each community would enjoy virtual veto power in matters of language, culture, and religion.

The proposal for an Assyrian self-administered zone established in the environs of Mosul, extending to Dohuk in the north and Fesh Khabur to the northwest has gained increasing appeal among Assyrian activists, intellectuals, and political leaders. The current political challenges facing Assyrians in the newly developing Iraq include rising Islamic pressure, gross under representation of Assyrians, and a sometimes callous misrepresentation of Assyrians simply as a Christian minority without reference to the Assyrian political, cultural, and nationalist platform.  As Mr. Jatou reflected, the increasing Islamic fervor as well as other challenges in Iraq necessitate the establishment of an administrative area for Assyrians and Yezidis.

===Current situation===
[[Image:Assyrianadministartedareasuggestion2005.jpg|thumb|250ppx|Assyrians make up the majority in two counties today in Iraq]]
The first of the many Church bombings that were to come, occurred on the morning of August 4, 2003, that left 19 worshippers dead.

As the attacks on Assyrians continue to escalate, with the 20th Church bombed and the death toll of the Assyrians climbing in 2004, demands by Assyrian politicians for an autonomous safe haven reached at an all-time high. A meeting took place in the [[British House of Commons]] to discuss the subject.

A meeting  was organized by the Labour MP [[Stephen Pound]], in conjunction with the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] and the Jubilee Campaign, a Christian human-rights group. 
Mr. Pound demands were: 
<ol>
<li> Support an autonomous administrative region as a safe haven 
<li> Support the infrastructure of the region 
<li> Oppose <U+201C>the active and passive ethnic cleansing<U+201D> of <U+201C>the only indigenous people of Iraq<U+201D> 
</ol>
Mr Pound argued, <U+201C>The fate of the Chaldo-Assyrians in Iraq will define the socio-political structure of the Middle East.<U+201D>

The then [[Prime Minister of Iraq]], [[Iyad Allawi]], said he was considering the plan, but nothing 
resulted as he lost his position in the January 2005 elections.

On November 30, 2005, Iraq's Foreign Minister [[Hoshiyar Zebari]] supported the idea of an Assyrian administrative region by saying "They (Assyrians) are free to organize a province or regional government. It should not be just because we have Kurdistan, but should be organized around an area. If they can do it in three provinces or even one it should and can be done." <ref>http://www.zindamagazine.com/html/archives/2005/11.30.05/index_wed.php</ref>
