A '''waterspout''' is an intense columnar [[vortex]] (usually appearing as a [[funnel]]-shaped [[cloud]]) that occurs over a [[body of water]] and is connected to a [[cumuliform cloud]]. In the common form, it is a non-[[supercell]] [[tornado]] over water. While it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts,<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> stronger versions spawned by [[mesocyclone]]s do occur.  Contrary to popular belief that waterspouts suck up water, the water seen in the main funnel cloud is actually water droplets formed by condensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/637532/waterspout|author=Encyclopedia Britannica|title=Waterspout|date=2009|accessdate=2009-08-28}}</ref> While many waterspouts form in the tropics, locations at higher latitude within temperate zones also report waterspouts, such as [[Europe]] and the [[Great Lakes]].  Although rare, waterspouts have been observed in connection with [[lake-effect snow]] [[rainband|precipitation bands]].  Waterspouts have a five-part life cycle: formation of a dark spot on the water surface, spiral pattern on the water surface, formation of a spray ring, development of the visible condensation funnel, and ultimately decay.

== Formation ==
[[Image:Three waterspouts Kijkduin.jpg|thumb|Waterspouts seen from the beach at Kijkduin near [[The Hague]], the [[Netherlands]] on August 27, 2006.]]
Waterspouts exist on a microscale, where their environment is less than two kilometers in width. Their bigger cloud that develops them can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus, or as great as a [[supercell]]. While some waterspouts are strong (tornadic) like their land-based counterparts, most are much weaker and caused by different atmospheric dynamics.  They normally develop in moisture-laden environments as their parent clouds are in the process of development, and it is theorized that they spin up as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal shear near the surface, and then stretch upwards to the cloud once the low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus or thunderstorm.  Weak tornadoes, known as [[landspout]]s, have been shown to develop in a similar manner.<ref name="Choy">{{cite web

== Types ==
=== Non-tornadic ===
[[Image:Waterspout noaa00307.jpg|thumb|A pair of waterspouts off the Bahamas]]
Waterspouts that are not associated with a rotating updraft of a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]], are known as "non-tornadic" or "fair-weather waterspouts", and are by far the most common type.  Fair-weather waterspouts occur in coastal waters and are associated with dark, flat-bottomed, developing convective [[cumulus]] towers.  Waterspouts of this type rapidly develop and dissipate, having life cycles shorter than 20&nbsp;minutes.<ref name="Choy"/>  They usually rate no higher than EF0 on the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]], generally exhibiting [[wind]]s of less than 30&nbsp;m/s (67&nbsp;mph).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mkx/?n=threat-definitions-waterspouts|title=Threat Definitions for Waterspouts|publisher=[[National Weather Service]] Central Region Headuqaters|author=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office, Milwaukee/Sullivan, WI|date=2008-04-30|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref>  They are most frequently seen in tropical and sub-tropical climates, with upwards of 400 per year observed in the [[Florida Keys]].<ref name="NWS"/> They typically move slowly, if at all, since the cloud they are attached to is horizontally static, being formed by vertical [[convection|convective action]] instead of the subduction/adduction interaction between colliding [[weather front|fronts]]. <ref name="NWS">{{cite web

=== Tornadic ===
"Tornadic waterspouts", also accurately referred to as "tornadoes over water", are formed from [[mesocyclone|mesocyclonic action]] in a manner essentially identical to traditional land-based tornadoes in connection with [[severe thunderstorm]]s, but simply occurring over water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mlb/ghwo/waterspout_levels.html|title=Graphical Hazardous Weather Outlook: Waterspout Threat|author=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office, [[Melbourne, Florida]]|accessdate=2009-06-21|date=2007-01-25|publisher=Southern Region Headquarters}}</ref>  A tornado which travels from land to a body of water would also be considered a tornadic waterspout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1175%2F1520-0434(2000)015%3C0122%3ATJPCFT%3E2.0.CO%3B2|title=The 12 July 1995 Pinellas County, Florida, Tornado/Waterspout|work=Weather and Forecasting, vol. 15, issue 1|date=February 2000|pages=122-134|author=Waylon G.

Golden|accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref>  Since the vast majority of mesocyclonic thunderstorms occur in land-locked areas of the [[United States]], true tornadic waterspouts are correspondingly rarer than their fair-weather counterparts.  However, some areas, such as the [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic]], [[Aegean sea|Aegean]] and [[Ionian sea]]s, tornadic waterspouts can make up half of the total number.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V95-4M0S2X8-2&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=9ea47b38d28775af204fdb15a4af79d9|title=Waterspouts of the Adriatic, Ionian and Aegean Sea and their meteorological environment|work=Journal of Atmospheric Research, vol. 83, issues 2-4|pages=542-557|author=Michalis V.

==Deterioration==

{{sectstub}}

Nothing has been written here yet about the longevity of any type landspout, about its deterioration or destruction and whether any techniques have been developed or are employed to cause the deterioration, destruction or deflection of waterspouts, especially where they can move onto the coast and maybe turn into tornadoes.

=== Snowspout === <!-- Ancor for other articles -->
A ''winter waterspout'', also known as a ''snow devil'', an ''icespout'', an ''ice devil'', a ''snonado'', or a ''snowspout'', is an extremely rare instance of a waterspout forming under the base of a [[snow squall]].<ref>{{cite web

</ref> The term "winter waterspout" is used to differentiate between the common warm season waterspout and this rare winter season event.  Very little is known about this phenomenon and only six known pictures of this event exist to date, four of which were taken in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].  There are a couple of critical criteria for the formation of a winter waterspout.  Extremely cold temperatures need to be present over a body of warm water enough to produce [[fog]] resembling [[steam]] above the water's surface; this requires a 19<U+00B0>&nbsp;C (34<U+00B0>&nbsp;F) temperature difference between the water and the invading surface air mass.  Like the more efficient [[lake-effect snow]] events, winds focusing down the axis of long lakes enhance wind convergence and likely enhance their development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/btv/events/15Jan2009/overview.shtml|title=15 January 2009: Lake Champlain Sea Smoke, Steam Devils, and Waterspout: Chapters IV and V|author=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office, [[Burlington, Vermont]]|publisher=Eastern Region Headquarters|date=2009-02-03|accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref>

Though the majority occur in the [[tropics]], they can seasonally appear in temperate areas throughout the world, and are common across the western coast of Europe as well as the British Isles and several areas of the Mediterranean and Baltic Sea. They are not restricted to saltwater; many have been reported on lakes and rivers including the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[St. Lawrence River]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080723/montreal_waterspout_080723/20080723?hub=TopStories|title=Rare waterspout forms in Montreal during storm|author=Canadian Television News Staff|date=2008-07-23|accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref> Waterspouts are fairly common on the Great Lakes during late summer and early fall, with a record 66+ waterspouts reported over just a seven day period in 2003. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vos.noaa.gov/MWL/dec_04/waterspout.shtml|title=The Great Waterspout Outbreak of 2003|author=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=2009-12-04|accessdate=2009-08-06}}</ref> They are more frequent within 100&nbsp;kilometers (60&nbsp;mi) from the coast than farther out at sea.  Waterspouts are common along the southeast U.S. coast, especially off southern [[Florida]] and the [[Florida Keys|Keys]] and can happen over seas, bays, and lakes worldwide.  Approximately 160 waterspouts are currently reported per year across Europe, with the Netherlands reporting the most at 60, followed by Spain and Italy at 25, and the United Kingdom at 15.  They are most common in late summer.  In the Northern Hemisphere, September has been pinpointed as the prime month of formation.

==Life cycle==
There are five stages to the waterspout life cycle.  Initially, a prominent circular, light-colored disk appears on the surface of the water, surrounded by a larger dark area of indeterminate shape.  After the formation of these colored disks on the water, a pattern of light and dark-colored spiral bands develop from the dark spot on the water surface.  Then, a dense [[annulus]] of sea spray, called a cascade, appears around the dark spot with what appears to be an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]].  Eventually, the waterspout becomes a visible funnel from the water surface to the overhead cloud.  The spray vortex can rise to a height of several hundred feet or more and often creates a visible wake and an associated wave train as it moves.  Eventually, the funnel and spray vortex begin to dissipate as the inflow of warm air into the vortex weakens, ending the waterspout's life cycle.<ref name="Bruce">{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/apx/science/les/les.php|title=Waterspouts|author=Bruce B.

== Nautical threat ==

Waterspouts have long been recognized as serious marine hazards.  Stronger waterspouts are usually quite dangerous, posing threats to ships, planes, helicopters, and swimmers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1438173/Water-spout-hit-helicopter.html|title=Water Spout Hit Helicopter|author=Auslan Cramb|work=The Telegraph|date=2003-08-07|accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref> It is recommended to keep a considerable distance from these phenomena, and to always be on alert through weather reports. The United States [[National Weather Service]] will often issue [[Severe weather terminology#Severe local storms|special marine warnings]] when waterspouts are likely or have been sighted over coastal waters, or [[tornado warning]]s when waterspouts are expected to move onshore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.weather.gov/mlb/ghwo/waterspout_rules.html|title=Graphical Hazardous Weather Outlook: Waterspout Threat|author=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast office, [[Melbourne, Florida]]|publisher=Southern Region Headquarters|date=2007-01-25|accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref>
