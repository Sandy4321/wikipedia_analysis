'''Jagdgeschwader 300''' ('''JG 300''') was a [[Luftwaffe]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]-[[Wing (air force unit)|wing]] of [[World War II]]. JG 300 was formed on June 26, 1943 in [[Deelen]] as Stab/'''Versuchskommando Herrmann''', from July 18, 1943 as Stab/'''JG Herrmann''', and then finally redesignated on August 20, 1943 to Stab/JG 300. Its first ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' was [[Oberstleutnant]] [[Hajo Herrmann]].

==Genesis and ''Wilde Sau''==
JG 300 had its origins in April 1943, when Major [[Hajo Herrmann|"Hajo" Herrmann]], a decorated bomber pilot advocated the use of single-seat day fighters in a night fighting role to combat the [[Royal Air Force]]'s (RAF) escalating Night Bomber Offensive. He suggested that single seat fighters could operate in the bombers' general target area using the light of target indicators, massed searchlights and the fires on the ground to spot their targets. These operations were trialed over Berlin during May and June 1943 and codenamed '[[Wilde Sau (Luftwaffe night fighter tactics)|Wilde Sau]]'.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}<!-- whole paragraph but last sentence in particular as the Bomber Command say the tactic was first used over Cologne on 3/4 July-->

Recruiting a group of experienced bomber pilots and former instructors with the requisite blind-flying experience, a test unit was set up on June 26, 1943 in [[Deelen]] as Stab/'''Versuchskommando Herrmann''' to test Herrmann's theory. Standard [[Focke-Wulf|Fw 190-A]]'s and [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109-G]]'s were used, initially 'borrowed' from their parent day units, principally [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)|Jagdgeschwader 1]] and [[Jagdgeschwader 11]].<ref>'Eagle's Wings' Hajo Herrmann,1991</ref>

Jagdgeschwader 300 employed the Wilde Sau tactic in single engine fighters for the first time on the night of 3/4 July 1943 when 653 RAF aircraft attacked Cologne's industrial area on the east bank of the [[Rhine]]. The German fighters, taking advantage of the illumination from searchlights, target indicator flares and ground fires claimed 12 aircraft shot down, but had to share their claims with the [[Anti-Aircraft Artillery|anti-aircraft batteries]] who also claimed the downings. To avoid losses to [[friendly fire]], anti-aircraft batteries were ordered to restrict the height of their flak barrage and the fighters operated above that pre-agreed ceiling.<ref name=Bomber-Command-Jul-43>[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/ RAF History <U+2013> Bomber Command 60th Anniversary],  [http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/jul43.html Campaign Diary: July 1943]. Accessed 21 July 2008</ref>

The test unit expanded into JG 300, its I. Gruppe officially formed  on August 20, 1943. Sister units [[JG 301]] and [[JG 302]] were also formed on similar lines at this time, collectively brought together as [[30th Fighter Division (Germany)|30. Jagd-Division]] under Herrmann's command. Special variants of the Bf 109 were later adapted for this night fighter duty; the Bf 109 G-6(N) and Bf 109 G-6(Y). The former was fitted with the [[Naxos radar detector|FuG 350 "Naxos Z"]] passive homing detector and the latter with the "Y" interception radio system. Initially however these single seat fighters used no radar or radio aids whatsoever.<ref name="Aders">'History of the German Night Fighter Force', G. Aders, 1979</ref>

Although 30. Jagd-Division was initially far from a fully established Jagdgeschwader the formation process was rapidly sped up with [[RAF Bomber Command]] deployment in July 1943 of 'Window'; radar-jamming tin-foil strips which had rendered the [[Kammhuber Line|Luftwaffe radar control system]] ineffective. JG 300 and its sister units were the only real interim counter measure while Luftwaffe radar research technology strove to overcome this jamming.<ref name="Aders"/>

JG 300's night operations met with considerable success initially. Its first formal defensive operation on 27/28 July 1943 saw the unit claim four of the 17 bombers downed that night for one loss.<ref>'The Other Battle'; Hinchcliffe, page 157</ref> Some 13 (out of a ''Nachtjagd'' total of 56 claimed) bombers were claimed shot down by JG 300 on the night of 24 August,<ref>'Luftwaffe night fighter combat claims, 1939-1945' ; J.Foreman, S.W. Parry page 106</ref> while a further 12 were claimed downed on 27<U+2013>28 August. 10 (from a total of 47) were claimed 1 September, and another 18 on 5<U+2013>6 September.<ref>'Luftwaffe night fighter combat claims, 1939-1945' ; J.Foreman, S.W. Parry page 110</ref> 

However, the number of night accidents involving single-seat fighters caused by poor weather conditions in the winter of 1943 led to unsustainable losses in pilots and aircraft.
Thus by the end of 1943 JG 300 fielded 3 Fw 190 A-6 (Stab), 14 Bf 109 G-6 (I Gruppe), 4 Fw 190 A-6 (II Gruppe) and 1 Bf 109 G-6 (III Gruppe).<ref name="ReferenceA">Aders</ref>
On 1 January 1944 parts of the I./JG 300 was detached and used to form 1./[[Nachtjagdgruppe 10]]. By early 1944 the Nachtjagdgeschwaders has been equipped with the advanced and "window-proof" [[Lichtenstein radar|Lichtenstein SN-2]] VHF airborne radar, and thus JG 300 gradually evolved into a standard day fighter unit, flying operations against the USAAF 8th and 15th Air Forces over Western Europe as a part of Reichsverteidigung ([[Defense of the Reich]]).<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Night operations were still sometimes flown, as on the 24/25 March 1944, when I. and II./JG 300 claimed 7 RAF bombers of one loss. By this time Oblt. [[Klaus Bretschneider]] of 5./JG 300 had, as a <U+201C>Wilde Sau<U+201D> night fighter, claimed 14 night victories during 20 combats<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

By May 1944, JG 300 at last had numbers approaching a full establishment of aircraft, with I./JG 300 having 42 (14 operative) Bf 109 G-6 at [[Bonn]] Hangelar; II./JG 300 stationed at [[Dortmund]] with 25 (13) Fw 190 A-6 and III./ JG 300 with 46 (25 operative) Bf 109 G-6 at [[Wiesbaden]]/Erbenheim. Major [[Walther Dahl]] was appointed Kommodore of JG 300 on 27 June.<ref>http://www.luftwaffe.cz/dahl.html</ref>

JG 300 lost several of its top aces in the summer of 1944. On 28 July 1944, Oblt. Ernst-Erich Hirschfeld (24 claims, 9 at night) of 5. JG 300 was shot down and killed in his Fw 190 A-8 near [[Erfurt]], as was Leut. Gerhard B<U+00E4>rsdorf (7 claims) who collided with his wing man. On 29 July 1944, ''Oberfeldwebel'' [[Hermann Wischnewski]] (26 claims) of I./JG 300 shot down two B-17 bombers and a P-51 fighter but then shot down himself and badly injured.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}<!-- whole paragraph -->

==Sturmgruppen==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-674-7765-17, Bei Alikendorf, abgeschossene B 24.jpg|thumb|right|shot Downed Consolidated [[B-24 Liberator]] of the [[492d Bombardment Group]] after an aerial battle at [[Oschersleben]] on 7 July 1944]]
In the summer of 1944 ''Sturmgruppe'' units were raised, equipped with [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190 operational history#The Sturmb<U+00F6>cke|heavily armoured and armed FW 190 fighters]], and charged with breaking up the massed ranks of USAAF daylight bombers. Initially manned by volunteers, each pilot was trained to close with the enemy and engage in extremely short-range combat, attacking from the front and the rear in tight arrowhead formations, even to contemplate deliberately [[Aerial ramming|ramming]] enemy bombers when circumstances permitted.

II./ JG 300 became such a ''Sturmgruppe'' unit at this time and, equipped with the Focke-Wulf 190 A-8/R2 or R8 with two [[MK 108 cannon|MK 108]] 30mm cannon, and two [[MG 151 cannon|MG 151/20]] 20mm cannon, enjoyed initial success in downing bombers, but also suffered heavy losses to the massed fighter escorts. From June 1944 until the end of October 1944 II gruppe suffered some 73 killed, 2 missing, and 32 wounded.

On 7 July 1944 a force of 1,129 [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es and [[B-24 Liberator]]s of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) [[Eighth Air Force]] set out from England to bomb aircraft factories in the [[Leipzig]] area and the synthetic oil plants at [[Boehlen]], [[Leuna]]-Merseburg and L<U+00FC>tzkendorf. This formation was intercepted by a German ''Gefechtsverband'' comprising IV.(Sturm) ''Gruppe'' [[Jagdgeschwader 3]], escorted by two ''Gruppen'' of Bf 109s from JG 300 led by Major [[Walther Dahl]]. Dahl drove the attack to point-blank range behind the Liberators of the 492nd Bomb Group before opening fire,  which at the time was temporarily without fighter cover. Within about a minute the entire squadron of twelve B-24s had been annihilated. The USAAF 2nd Air Division lost 28 Liberators that day, the majority to the Sturmgruppe attack. IV./JG 3 lost nine fighters shot down and three more suffered damage and made crash landings; five of the unit's pilots were killed.<ref>Weal 1996, p. 78.</ref>

[[File:Ellgaard, Ich ramme 1944.jpg|thumb|left|A 1944 drawing by [[Helmuth Ellgaard]] illustrating "ramming"]]
USAAF escort fighters were increasingly effective. On 11 September 1944 II.(Sturm)/JG 300 lost 13 Fw 190s to P-51 Mustangs, with 10 pilots killed and two wounded. They claimed nine Mustangs, actual Mustang losses was just one 339th Fighter Group P-51, damaged by Flak and shot down by an Me 262. I./JG 300, flying top cover lost 13 Bf 109s without claiming a kill. One pilot was killed and one wounded.<ref>Caldwell & Muller 2007, p. 233.</ref>
Major [[Alfred Lindenberger]], (a forty-seven-year-old Prussian World War I ace with 12 victories) was posted to II./JG 300 in June 1944 and was made ''Gruppenkommandeur'' later in 1944. On 28 September 1944 he was shot down by P-51s and wounded. Owing to his age and inexperience with modern fighters he flew most sorties as a wingman. Lindenberger claimed two US four-engined bombers on 17 December 1944.

As the year progressed the ''30 Jagddivision'' was broken up, as JG 301 left for [[Ploesti]] in Romania while JG 302 flew combat over Hungary and Austria. Only JG 300 remained in the Reich. Major Dahl was dismissed from his command of JG 300 by [[Hermann G<U+00F6>ring]] on 30 November 1944 for refusal to launch what he considered a suicidal interception mission.

During the Ardennes offensive in late 1944 JG 300 was one of the few units remaining on [[Defense of the Reich|Reich defence]] duties with most other fighter units sent to support attacking ground forces.
The Geschwader took heavy losses in late 1944, particularly on 17 December when 100 aircraft of JG 300 intercepted USAAF bombers, claiming 33 shot down but losing 43 of their own number.
Many of the pilots killed were irreplaceable ''Experten'', including on 24 December 1944, the Staffelkapit<U+00E4>n of 5./JG 300  Oblt [[Klaus Bretschneider]] who was shot down by 357th FG P-51s (who claimed 28 fighters for 2 losses).

On 14 January 1945 a mixed formation of JG 300 and JG 301 were attacked by USAAF escort fighters during an interception against the USAAF 3rd Air Division bombing oil targets over central Germany. The two Geschwaders claimed 18 B-17s, 7 P-51s and one P-47 downed, although the mixed formation lost 89 aircraft with 52 killed and 18 wounded. (JG 300 lost 51 fighters, with 32 pilots killed and 10 wounded).The 357th Fighter Group claimed over 50 kills, and the 56th FG and the 20th FG also claimed victories. 

On 14 February 1945 operations against the USAAF bomber streams by JG 300 and JG 301 led to I. and III./JG 300 losing 3 Bf 109s and II./JG 300 losing 6 Fw 190s.
