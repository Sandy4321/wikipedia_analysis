"'''New Inside'''" is a song by American singer [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]], released as the lead single from her third studio album ''[[New Inside]]'' in 1990.<ref name="discogs1">{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Tiffany-New-Inside/master/74335 |title=Tiffany&nbsp;<U+2013> New Inside at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>

==Background==
"New Inside" was written by [[Phillip Damien]] and [[Donnie Wahlberg]] of the New Kids, under the name Dennis Cheese. Damien solely produced the song whilst Cheese was also credited with the rap of the track. The song, like the ''New Inside'' album, marked a change of musical direction for Tiffany, as an attempt to move away from pop by embracing a tougher urban contemporary R&B sound.<ref>{{cite web|last=Henderson |first=Alex |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/new-inside-mw0000309448 |title=New Inside&nbsp;<U+2013> Tiffany : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> The song failed to enter the American charts, whilst also failing to make an impression elsewhere except Japan where the song peaked at #18, and stayed in the Top 100 for a total of nine weeks. Originally the song debuted at #82 and was last seen on the chart in early December 1990 at #90.<ref name="j-wave1">{{cite web|url=http://www.j-wave.co.jp/original/tokiohot100/cgi-bin/top100.cgi |title=J-WAVE WEBSITE : TOKIO HOT100 |publisher=J-wave.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsort.info/music/v7vx4w.htm |title=Song artist 888&nbsp;<U+2013> Tiffany |publisher=Tsort.info |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>

In America, the ''New Inside'' album and single was not the commercial success hoped. The title song managed to gain a minor amount of airplay in some areas and reached some local radio stations' request-based countdowns thanks to the efforts of fans, who were starting to get organized on bulletin board systems and online services.

In a 2012 article based on Tiffany by Audio Video Revolution, the singer spoke about the title track and the message behind the album/song, stating ''"When New Kids On The Block started opening for me on the first round of the tour, I think that opened my eyes a lot, too, because I saw so much how they would nurture their ideas rather than squash them. Sometimes their ideas were outlandish and it was, "We will get there, but we're not there now. But that's a good idea a year from now." A lot of people around me made me feel silly to be saying things, or just didn't listen. So I kind of knew that wasn't going to work in a long-term career. When I finally started working on the New Inside project and "New Inside" itself, that's exactly what the song is about. Of course, we made it about a love relationship, but the song is really more about busting down those walls, changing things, being open-minded, pushing yourself a little bit and being a little "new inside."''<ref>{{cite web|last=Eakin |first=Marah |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/tiffany-on-i-think-were-alone-now-being-the-queen,84041/ |title=Tiffany on "I Think We<U+2019>re Alone Now," being the queen of the mall, and dubstep &#124; Mall Week &#124; Set List |publisher=The A.V.
