{{Expand section|at least geographical coverage and standard of the passenger services|date=June 2008}}

The main passenger services of TrainOSE are regular ({{lang-el|<U+039A><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+03BD><U+03AE> <U+03B1><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03BE><U+03BF><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+03C7><U+03AF><U+03B1>}}, ''common train''), express trains ({{lang-el|<U+03A4><U+03B1><U+03C7><U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03B1>}} and <U+03A4><U+03B1><U+03C7><U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03B1> <U+03A0><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C4><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03B9><U+03CC><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03C2>), Intercity and Intercity Express trains. Regular service is the slowest, with trains making frequent stops; however, at smaller railway halts they often stop only if there are passengers embarking or disembarking. It should be noted that there is also a large number of railway halts that do not have any passenger services anymore, even if the stops still exist in the network documents. Regular service is also the cheapest available. Express trains are faster trains, making fewer stops, but do not necessarily offer more comfortable accomodation. In some, but not all, express trains a moderately priced supplement ticket is required. Intercity and Intercity Express trains are the fastest and also the most expensive; the needed supplement in IC and ICE trains typically doubled or tripled the base fare respectively, but nowadays this is dertermined more by the different competing forms of transport, mainly air transport. Car transport, sleeping cars and couchettes are available on some trains on the main line from Athens to Thessaloniki and further north as well as for the now defunct Thessaloniki-Istanbul train.

Generally train numbers indicate the type of the train: regular trains (and also Proastiakos suburban trains and some <U+2018>special<U+2019> trains) have 4-digit train numbers, express trains have 3-digit train numbers and Intercity and Intercity Express trains have 2-digit train numbers, often preceded by the symbols IC or ICE.

The following table shows the situation in March 2011, pending publication of an updated timetable. Numbers indicate trains on each direction on weekdays (Monday-Firday) excluding public holidays.

===''Proastiakos'' suburban service===
{{Main| Proastiakos}}

[[Proastiakos]] ({{lang-el|<U+03A0><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03B1><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03C2>}}, meaning just "suburban") is the suburban service of TrainOSE in the Athens and Thessaloniki areas. Proastiakos was initially an independent subsidiary within the OSE group, but has since been merged with TrainOSE S.A. The network infrastructure, even if partly purpose-built for the suburban service, is part of the national railway network of OSE, and as such available also for other types of services, even freight.

Proastiakos is a relatively new development: the first service opened for 2004 Athens Olympic Games between Athens International Airport "El. Venizelos" and Athens via Neratziotissa station, close to the Olympic Stadium. Lines currently served include the 'main corridor' Piraeus<U+2013>Athens<U+2013>[[Acharnai Railway Center]] (<U+03A3><U+03B9><U+03B4><U+03B7><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03BC><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03CC> <U+039A><U+03AD><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+03BF> <U+0391><U+03C7><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03BD><U+03CE><U+03BD>, SKA), SKA<U+2013>Athens International Airport, SKA<U+2013>Corinth<U+2013>Kiato, and Thessaloniki<U+2013>Larissa.

[[Image:20070606-Piraeus-Desiro GTW.jpg|thumb|Proastiakos suburban trains at Piraeus railway station]]

Only the Ano Liossia<U+2013>Airport section is currently electified; therefore, EMUs can be used on this service, limiting direct services from Airport past Ano Liosia. Neratziotissa station has connection with the ISAP trains. Plakentias station has connection with Metro line&nbsp;three. The line and stations from Plakentias station to the Airport are also served by Metro line&nbsp;three trains. At Athens Central ''Larissa'' station, there is connection with Metro line&nbsp;two. Proastiakos service from Athens to Kiato, being the only passenger train service from Athens to Peloponnese connecting with the Peloponnese metre gauge network, has a somewhat wider role than a pure suburban service.

The rolling stock used on the electrified Neratziotissa<U+2013>Airport and Thessaloniki<U+2013>Larissa lines consists of Class&nbsp;460  [[Siemens Desiro]] EMUs. On non-electrified sections Stadler GTW&nbsp;2/6 DMUs and MAN-2000 DMUs are used. Occasionally, even class&nbsp;520 InterCity trainsets have been used to run Proastiakos services.

Currently, due to construction works of the infrastructure, there's no direct service from Athens/Piraeus to Athens International Airport. Services are running between Airport<U+2013>Ano Liosia and Piraeus-Athens-Ano Liosia-Kiato. This makes the small Ano Liosia station the temporary 'hub' where the Proastiakos services to different destinations interconnect.

On the Thessaloniki<U+2013>Larissa line, there are currently 12 trains per day in each direction.

===Freight rail===
As of February 2011 the current regular freight services consist of:
* A night service from Agios Ioannis Rentis to Thessaloniki yard
* A night service from Thessaloniki yard to Agios Ioannis Rentis
* A nigth service from Agios Ioannis Rentis to Agioi Anargyroi container unloading facility and back

Other irregular national and international freight services exist as well.

==International Services==
[[Image:Bahnhof Pithion Z<U+00FC>ge.jpg|thumb | right | A [[Turkish State Railways|TCCD]] passenger train next to a greek freight train at Pythio station, where OSE's network connects to that of TCDD (2007)]]
All international passenger services have been suspended since February 2011. The Greek railway system connects with the railways of the neighbouring countries as follows: with the railways of Bulgaria at Promahonas (Koulata) and at [[Ormenion]], with the railways of Turkey near [[Pythio]], and with the railways of the Republic of Macedonia at Idomeni. 

The passenger services from Greece to neighbouring countries were, on December 2010:

* Thessaloniki <U+2013> Istanbul ([[Dostluk/Filia Express]])
* Thessaloniki <U+2013> Sofia <U+2013> Bucharest
* Thessaloniki <U+2013> Idomeni <U+2013> Skopje <U+2013> Belgrade
* Athens <U+2013> Sofia
