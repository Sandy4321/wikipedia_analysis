"'''Missing My Baby'''" is a song released by American recording artist [[Selena]] on her third studio album ''[[Entre a Mi Mundo]]'' (1992). It was composed by [[A.B. Quintanilla III]]<U+2014>her brother and principal record producer, whose intention was to showcase Selena's diverse musical abilities. Selena included it on the album to help her [[crossover (music)|cross over]] into the English-speaking market. Critics praised her emotive enunciation in the song. A posthumous music video made for [[VH1]] was released in 1998 to promote her triple box-set ''[[Anthology (Selena album)|Anthology]]'' (1998).

"Missing My Baby" is a mid-tempo [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[ballad]] influenced by [[urban music|urban]] and [[soul music]]. The lyrics describe the love felt by the narrator, who reminisces of rhapsodic events she has shared with her lover. In some parts of the song, the narrator experiences loneliness and anguish because of the absence of her boyfriend. Although never intended to be released as a single, the track peaked at number 22 on the US [[Rhythmic Top 40]] chart in 1995.
