{{Reformation}}
The '''Protestant Reformation''' was the [[schism (religion)|schism]] within [[Western Christianity]] initiated by [[John Wycliffe]], [[Jan Hus]], [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]], and other early [[Protestants]]. It was sparked by the 1517 posting of Luther's [[Ninety-Five Theses]]. The efforts of the self-described "reformers", who objected to ("protested") the doctrines, rituals, leadership, and [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] structure of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], led to the creation of new national Protestant churches. The Reformation was precipitated by earlier events within Europe, such as the [[Black Death]] and the [[Western Schism]], which eroded people's faith in the Catholic Church and the [[Papacy]] that governed it. This, as well as many other factors, such as the spread of [[Renaissance]] ideas, the spread of the [[printing press]], and the fall of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], contributed to the creation of Protestantism.

The Roman Catholic Church responded with a [[Counter-Reformation]] initiated by the [[Council of Trent]] and spearheaded by the new order of the [[Society of Jesus|Society of Jesus (Jesuits)]] specifically organised to counter the Protestant movement. In general, [[Northern Europe]], with the exception of most of Ireland, turned Protestant. [[Southern Europe]] remained Roman Catholic, while [[Central Europe]] was a site of fierce conflict, escalating to full-scale war.{{sfn|Cameron|2012}}

The first of the new churches was the [[Unitas Fratrum]] ([[Unity of the Brethren]]) dating their origins to [[Jan Hus]] in the early 15th century. The largest of the new churches were the [[Lutherans]] (mostly in Germany, the [[Baltics]] and Scandinavia) and the [[Reformed churches]] (mostly in Germany, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Scotland). There were many smaller bodies such as the [[Free Christians]], as well.

Although there had been a reformation movement significantly predating Luther, the most common dating of the Protestant Reformation begins in 1517, when Luther published ''[[The Ninety-Five Theses]]'', and concludes in 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] that ended years of [[European wars of religion|European religious wars]].{{sfn|Cameron|2012}}

==Religious situation in Europe==
The Reformation began as an attempt to reform the Roman Catholic Church, by priests who opposed what they perceived as false doctrines and ecclesiastic malpractice<U+2014>especially the teaching and the sale of indulgences or the abuses thereof, and simony, the selling and buying of clerical offices<U+2014>that the reformers saw as evidence of the systemic corruption of the Church's Roman Catholic Church [[hierarchy]], which included the Pope.

In Germany, reformation ideals developed in 1517-1521 when [[Martin Luther]] expressed doubts over the legitimacy of indulgences and the ''[[plenitudo potestatis]]'' of the pope.

Martin Luther's spiritual predecessors included [[John Wycliffe]] and [[Jan Hus]], who likewise had attempted to reform the Roman Catholic Church. The Reformation is often dated to 31 October 1517, [[All Hallows' Eve]], in Wittenberg, [[Saxony]], where Luther nailed his ''[[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences]]'' to the door of the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|Castle Church]]. The theses debated and criticised the Church and the Pope, but concentrated upon the selling of indulgences and doctrinal policies about [[Purgatory#Protestantism|purgatory]], [[Particular judgment#Reformation concepts|particular judgment]], and the authority of the Pope. He would later in the period 1517-1521 write works on the Catholic devotion to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], the intercession of and devotion to the saints, the sacraments, mandatory clerical celibacy, monasticism, further on the authority of the Pope, the ecclesiastical Ban (Law), Censure and Excommunication, the [[To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation|prerogatives of secular rulers in religious matters]], [[On the Freedom of a Christian|the relationship between Christianity and the Law]], Good Works, and [[On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church|the sacraments]]. In the event, other religious reformers, such as Ulrich Zwingli, soon followed Martin Luther's example.

The [[Protestant reformers|reformers]] soon disagreed among themselves and divided their movement according to [[doctrine|doctrinal differences]]<U+2014>first between Luther and Zwingli, later between Luther and [[John Calvin]]<U+2014>resulting in the establishment of different and rival [[Christian denomination|Denominations]], such as the Lutheran, the Reformed, the Puritans, and the Presbyterian. Elsewhere, the religious reformation causes, processes, and effects were different; Anglicanism arose in England with the [[English Reformation]], and most Protestant denominations derive from the Germanic denominations. The reformers also accelerated the development of the Counter-Reformation by the Catholic Church.

== History and origins ==
Protestant churches, such as the [[Unitas Fratrum]] ([[Unity of the Brethren]]), [[Moravian Church]] (Bohemian Brethren) date their origins to [[Jan Hus]] in the early 15th century. As it was led by a Bohemian noble majority, and recognised, for a time, by the Basel Compacts, the Hussite Reformation was Europe's first "[[Magisterial Reformation]]" because the ruling magistrates supported them; unlike the "[[Radical Reformation]]", which the State did not support. One hundred years later, in Germany the protests erupted simultaneously, whilst under threat of [[Islamic]] [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman wars in Europe|invasion]] [[#Footnotes|<U+00B9>]], which especially distracted the German princes responsible for military defence.
[[Mainline Protestants]] generally date their doctrinal separation from the Roman Catholic Church to the 16th century.

===Earlier schisms===
Unrest due to the [[Western Schism|Great Schism of Western Christianity]] (1378<U+2013>1416) excited wars between princes, uprisings among the peasants, and widespread concern over corruption in the church. New perspectives came from John Wycliffe at [[Oxford University]], then from Jan Hus at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]]. Hus objected to some of the practices of the Roman Catholic Church and wanted to return the church in [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] to early [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]-inspired practices: [[Mass (liturgy)|liturgy]] in the language of the people (i.e. Czech), having lay people receive [[Communion rite|communion]] in both kinds (bread ''and'' wine - that is, in Latin, [[Utraquist|communio sub utraque specie]]), married priests, and eliminating [[indulgences]] and the idea of [[Purgatory]]. Hus rejected indulgences and adopted a doctrine of [[Sola fide|justification by grace through faith alone]]. The Roman Catholic Church officially concluded this debate at the [[Council of Constance]] (1414<U+2013>1417). The conclave condemned Hus, who was executed by burning in spite of a promise of safe-conduct. Wycliffe was posthumously burned as a heretic.<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=vuES0JdltfcC&pg=PA54&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Luther: man between God and the Devil]''". Heiko Augustinus Oberman, Eileen Walliser-Schwarzbart (2006). [[Yale University Press]]. p.54<U+2013>55. ISBN 0-300-10313-1</ref>

The Council of Constance confirmed and strengthened the traditional medieval conception of church and empire. It did not address the national tensions, or the theological tensions stirred up during the previous century. The council could not prevent [[Schism (religion)|schism]] and the [[Hussite Wars]] in Bohemia.<ref>"http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Hussites Hussites]". [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]].</ref>

[[Sixtus IV]] (1471<U+2013>1484) established the practice of selling indulgences to be applied to the dead, thereby establishing a new stream of revenue with agents across Europe.<ref>James Patrick, ''Renaissance and Reformation'' (2007) p 1231</ref> [[Pope Alexander VI]] (1492<U+2013>1503) was one of the most controversial of the [[Renaissance]] Popes. He fathered seven children, including [[Lucrezia Borgia|Lucrezia]] and [[Cesare Borgia]], by at least two mistresses.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6909589.stm Fresco fragment revives Papal scandal]". BBC News. 21 July 2007.</ref> Fourteen years after his death, the corruption of the papacy that Pope Alexander VI exemplified<U+2014>particularly the sale of indulgences<U+2014>prompted Luther to write ''The Ninety-Five Theses'', which he nailed to the door of a church at Wittenberg in Saxony.

=== 16th century ===
[[File:Martin Luther by Lucas Cranach der <U+00C4>ltere.jpeg|thumb|[[Martin Luther]], shown in a portrait by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], initiated the Protestant Reformation in 1517]]
The protests against the corruption emanating from Rome began in earnest when Luther, an Augustinian monk at the university of Wittenberg, called in 1517 for a reopening of the debate on the sale of indulgences and the authority to absolve sin and remit one from purgatory. The Reformation was born of Luther's dual declaration <U+2013> first, the discovering of Jesus and salvation by faith alone; and second, identifying the Papacy as the Antichrist. The reformers were unanimous in agreement and this understanding of prophecy furnished importance to their deeds. It was the rallying point and the battle cry that made the Reformation nearly unassailable.<ref>{{cite book|last=Froom|first=LeRoy|title=The Prophetic Faith of our Fathers| volume= 2| year=1928|pages=243<U+2013>244|ref=harv}}</ref> The Reformers made heavy use of inexpensive pamphlets (using the relatively new [[printing press]] invented by [[Johannes Gutenberg]]) so there was swift movement of both ideas and documents, including ''[[The Ninety-Five Theses]]''.

Parallel to events in Germany, a movement began in [[History of Switzerland|Switzerland]] under the leadership of [[Ulrich Zwingli]]. These two movements quickly agreed on most issues, but some unresolved differences kept them separate. Some followers of Zwingli believed that the Reformation was too conservative, and moved independently toward more radical positions, some of which survive among modern day [[Anabaptist]]s. Other Protestant movements grew up along lines of mysticism or [[humanism]], sometimes breaking from Rome or from the Protestants, or forming outside of the churches.

[[File:95Thesen.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Martin Luther's [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]]]]
After this first stage of the Reformation, following the [[excommunication]] of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the Pope, the work and writings of [[John Calvin]] were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland, [[History of Scotland|Scotland]], Hungary, Germany and elsewhere.

The Reformation foundations engaged with [[Augustinians|Augustinianism]]. Both Luther and Calvin thought along lines linked with the theological teachings of [[Augustine of Hippo]]. The Augustinianism of the Reformers struggled against [[Pelagianism]], a heresy that they perceived in the Roman Catholic Church of their day. In the course of this religious upheaval, the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1524<U+2013>1525 swept through the Bavarian, [[Thuringia]]n and [[Swabia]]n principalities, including the [[Black Company]] of [[Florian Geier]], a knight from [[Giebelstadt]] who joined the peasants in the general outrage against the Roman Catholic hierarchy.  Luther, however, condemned the revolt, thus contributing to its eventual defeat. Some 100,000 peasants were killed.<ref>"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/448217/Peasants-War Peasants<U+2019> War (German History)]". Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica.</ref>

Even though Luther and Calvin had very similar theological teachings, the relationship between their followers turned quickly to conflict. Frenchman [[Michel de Montaigne]] told a story of a Lutheran pastor who declared over dinner that he would rather hear a hundred masses than take part in one of Calvin's sacraments.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=iRBEAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA571#v=onepage&q=&f=false The Complete Works of Michel de Montaigne]</ref><ref>The journal of Montaigne's travels in Italy by way of Switzerland and Germany in 1580 and 1581; translated by W.G. Waters, John Murray, London, 1903</ref>

The political separation of the [[Church of England]] from Rome under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], beginning in 1529 and completed in 1536, brought England alongside this broad Reformed movement. However, religious changes in the English national church proceeded more conservatively than elsewhere in Europe. Reformers in the Church of England accepted Protestant doctrine but the structure of the church ministry remained, and the Church alternated, for centuries, between sympathies for older traditions and radical Protestantism represented by the puritans, progressively forging a compromise between adherence to ancient tradition and Protestantism. In the Victorian period [[John Henry Newman]] reinterpreted this as the establishment of a ''[[via media]]''.

====Literacy====
[[File:Lutherbibel.jpg|thumb|right|Matin Luther's 1534 [[Luther Bible|Bible]] translated into German]]
The Reformation was a triumph of literacy and the new printing press.{{sfn|Cameron|2012}} Luther's translation of the Bible into German was a decisive moment in the spread of literacy, and stimulated as well the printing and distribution of religious books and pamphlets. From 1517 onward, religious pamphlets flooded Germany and much of Europe.<ref name="Mark">Mark U. Edwards, Jr., ''Printing, Propaganda, and Martin Luther'' (1994)</ref>

By 1530, over 10,000 publications are known, with a total of ten million copies. The Reformation was thus a media revolution. Luther strengthened his attacks on Rome by depicting a "good" against "bad" church. From there, it became clear that print could be used for propaganda in the Reformation for particular agendas. Reform writers used pre-Reformation styles, clich<U+00E9>s, and stereotypes and changed items as needed for their own purposes.<ref name="Mark" /> Especially effective were writings in German, including Luther's translation of the Bible, his ''Small Catechism'' for parents teaching their children, and his ''Larger Catechism,'' for pastors.<ref>See texts at [http://www.projectwittenberg.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/wittenberg-luther.html#sw-hymn English translation]</ref>

Using the German vernacular they expressed the Apostles' Creed in simpler, more personal, Trinitarian language. Illustrations in the German Bible and in many tracts popularised Luther's ideas. [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] (1472<U+2013>1553), the great painter patronised by the electors of Wittenberg, was a close friend of Luther, and illustrated Luther's theology for a popular audience. He dramatised Luther's views on the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, while remaining mindful of Luther's careful distinctions about proper and improper uses of visual imagery.<ref>Christoph Weimer, "Luther and Cranach on Justification in Word and Image."

====Zwingli====
[[File:Ulrich Zwingli.jpg|thumb|left|Ulrich Zwingli]]
{{main|Huldrych Zwingli}}
Parallel to events in Germany, a movement began in the [[Swiss Confederation]] under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli. Zwingli was a scholar and preacher who moved to [[Zurich]] <U+2013> the then-leading city state <U+2013> in 1518, a year after Martin Luther began the Reformation in Germany with his [[95 Theses]]. Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology, as the recently introduced [[printing press]] spread ideas rapidly from place to place, some unresolved differences kept them separate. A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism. Although [[Zwinglianism]] does hold uncanny resemblance to Lutheranism (it even had its own equivalent of the [[95 Theses]], called the [[67 Conclusions]]), historians have been unable to prove that Zwingli had any contact with Luther's publications before 1520, and Zwingli himself maintained that he had prevented himself from reading them. The German Prince [[Philip of Hesse]] saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther, seeing strength in a united Protestant front. A meeting was held in his castle in 1529, now known as the [[Colloquy of Marburg]], which has become infamous for its complete failure. The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine. Although Luther preached [[consubstantiation]] in the [[Eucharist]] over [[transubstantiation]], he believed in the spiritual presence of Christ at the mass. Zwingli believed that the mass was only representative and memorial <U+2013> Christ was not present. Luther became so angry that he famously carved into the meeting table '[[Hoc Est Corpus Meum]]' <U+2013> a Biblical quotation from the [[Last Supper]] meaning 'this is my body'. Some followers of Zwingli believed that the Reformation was too conservative, and moved independently toward more radical positions, some of which survive among modern day [[Anabaptist]]s. One famous incident illustrating this was when radical Zwinglians fried and ate sausages during Lent in Zurich city square by way of protest against the Church teaching of [[good works]]. Other Protestant movements grew up along lines of mysticism or humanism ([[cf.]] [[Erasmus]]), sometimes breaking from Rome or from the Protestants, or forming outside of the churches.

==== John Calvin ====
[[File:Calvin 1562.jpg|thumb|John Calvin at 53 in an engraving by [[Ren<U+00E9> Boyvin]].]]
{{main|John Calvin}}

Following the [[excommunication]] of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the Pope, the work and writings of John Calvin were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland, [[Scotland]], Hungary, Germany and elsewhere. After the expulsion of its Bishop in 1526, and the unsuccessful attempts of the Berne reformer Guillaume (William) Farel, Calvin was asked to use the organisational skill he had gathered as a student of law to discipline the 'fallen city' of Geneva. His 'Ordinances' of 1541 involved a collaboration of Church affairs with the City council and consistory to bring morality to all areas of life. After the establishment of the Geneva academy in 1559, Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement, providing refuge for Protestant exiles from all over Europe and educating them as Calvinist missionaries. These missionaries dispersed Calvinism widely, and formed the French Huguenots in Calvin's own lifetime, as well as causing the conversion of Scotland under the leadership of the cantankerous John Knox in 1560.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rick Cornish|title=5 Minute Church Historian: Maximum Truth in Minimum Time|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=29gkOq9OhNwC&pg=PT118|year=2010|publisher=NavPress|page=118}}</ref> The faith continued to spread after Calvin's death in 1563 and reached as far as Constantinople by the start of the 17th century.

The Reformation foundations engaged with [[Augustinians|Augustinianism]]. Both Luther and Calvin thought along lines linked with the theological teachings of [[Augustine of Hippo]]. The Augustinianism of the Reformers struggled against [[Pelagianism]], a heresy that they perceived in the Roman Catholic Church of their day. Unfortunately, since Calvin and Luther disagreed strongly on certain matters of theology (such as double-predestination and Holy Communion), the relationship between Lutherans and Calvinists was one of conflict.

=== Scandinavia ===
:''See also: [[Reformation in Denmark-Norway and Holstein]], [[Religion in Iceland#The Reformation|Reformation in Iceland]], [[Religion in Norway#From Reformation to 1964|Reformation in Norway]], [[Religion in Sweden#Protestant Reformation|Reformation in Sweden]]''

All of [[Scandinavia]] ultimately adopted Lutheranism over the course of the 16th century, as the monarchs of [[Denmark]] (who also ruled [[Norway]] and [[Iceland]]) and [[Sweden]] (who also ruled [[Finland]]) converted to that faith.

In Sweden, the Reformation was spearheaded by [[Gustav Vasa]], elected king in 1523. Friction with the pope over the latter's interference in Swedish ecclesiastical affairs led to the discontinuance of any official connection between Sweden and the papacy from 1523.<ref name="Gilbert-12">[http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/12.html Chapter 12 The Reformation In Germany And Scandinavia], Renaissance and Reformation by William Gilbert.</ref> Four years later, at the Diet of V<U+00E4>ster<U+00E5>s, the king succeeded in forcing the diet to accept his dominion over the national church. The king was given possession of all church property, church appointments required royal approval, the clergy were subject to the civil law, and the "pure Word of God" was to be preached in the churches and taught in the schools<U+2014>effectively granting official sanction to Lutheran ideas.<ref name="Gilbert-12" />

Under the reign of [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]] (1523<U+2013>33), Denmark remained officially Roman Catholic. But though Frederick initially pledged to persecute Lutherans, he soon adopted a policy of protecting Lutheran preachers and reformers, of whom the most famous was [[Hans Tausen]].<ref name="Gilbert-12" /> During his reign, Lutheranism made significant inroads among the Danish population. Frederick's son, Christian, was openly Lutheran, which prevented his election to the throne upon his father's death. In 1536, the authority of the Roman Catholic bishops was terminated by national assembly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eldrbarry.net/heidel/scanref.pdf|title=The Scandinavian Reformers|accessdate=2009-05-30}}</ref> The next year, following his victory in the [[Count's War]], he became king as [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] and continued the [[Reformation in Denmark-Norway and Holstein|reformation of the state church]] with assistance of [[Johannes Bugenhagen]].

=== England ===
{{main|English Reformation}}

[[File:Darnley stage 3.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], Queen of England and Ireland.]]

==== Church of England ====
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
The separation of the [[Church of England]] (or Anglican Church) from Rome under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], beginning in 1529 and completed in 1537, brought England alongside this broad Reformation movement; however, religious changes in the English national church proceeded more conservatively than elsewhere in Europe. Reformers in the Church of England alternated, for centuries, between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles, gradually developing into a tradition considered a middle way (''[[via media]]'') between the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions.

The [[English Reformation]] followed a different course from the Reformation in continental Europe. There had long been a strong strain of anti-clericalism and England had already given rise to the [[Lollard]] movement of [[John Wycliffe]], which played an important part in inspiring the [[Hussite]]s in [[Bohemia]]. Lollardy was suppressed and became an underground movement, so the extent of its influence in the 1520s is difficult to assess. The different character of the English Reformation came rather from the fact that it was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII.

Henry had once been a sincere Roman Catholic and had even authored a book strongly criticising Luther, but he later found it expedient and profitable to break with the Papacy. His wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]], bore him only a single child that survived infancy, [[Mary I of England|Mary]]. As England had recently gone through a lengthy dynastic conflict (''see [[Wars of the Roses]]''), Henry feared that his lack of a male heir might jeopardise his descendants' claim to the throne. However, Pope [[Clement VII]], concentrating more on Charles V's sack of Rome, denied his request for an annulment. Had Clement granted the annulment and therefore admitted that his predecessor, [[Julius II]], had erred, Clement would have given support to the Lutheran assertion that Popes replaced their own judgment for the will of God.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

King Henry decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome. In 1534, the [[Act of Supremacy]] made Henry the [[Supreme Head]] of the Church of England. Between 1535 and 1540, under [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]], the policy known as the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] was put into effect. The veneration of some [[saint]]s, certain pilgrimages and some pilgrim shrines were also attacked. Huge amounts of church land and property passed into the hands of the Crown and ultimately into those of the nobility and gentry. The vested interest thus created made for a powerful force in support of the dissolutions.

There were some notable opponents to the [[Henrician Reformation]], such as [[St. Thomas More]] and Bishop [[St. John Fisher]], who were executed for their opposition. There was also a growing party of reformers who were imbued with the Zwinglian and Calvinistic doctrines now current on the Continent. When Henry died he was succeeded by his Protestant son [[Edward VI]], who, through his empowered councillors (with the King being only nine years old at his succession and not yet sixteen at his death) the Duke of Somerset and the Duke of Northumberland, ordered the destruction of images in churches, and the closing of the [[chantry|chantries]]. Under Edward VI the reform of the [[Church of England]] was established unequivocally in doctrinal terms.

Yet, at a popular level, religion in England was still in a state of flux. Following a brief Roman Catholic restoration during the reign of [[Mary I of England|Mary]] 1553<U+2013>1558, a loose consensus developed during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], though this point is one of considerable debate among historians. Yet it is this "[[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]]" which largely formed [[Anglicanism]] into a distinctive church tradition. The compromise was uneasy and was capable of veering between extreme [[Calvinism]] on the one hand and Roman Catholicism on the other, but compared to the bloody and chaotic state of affairs in contemporary France, it was relatively successful until the Puritan Revolution or [[English Civil War]] in the 17th century.

==== Puritan movement ====
{{main|Puritan|English Civil War}}
{{refimprove section|date=February 2013}}
The success of the [[Counter-Reformation]] on the Continent and the growth of a [[Puritan]] party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarised the [[Elizabethan Age]], although it was not until the '40s that England underwent religious strife comparable to what its neighbours had suffered some generations before.

The early ''Puritan movement'' (late 16th<U+2013>17th centuries) was [[Reformed]] or [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and was a movement for reform in the [[Church of England]]. Its origins lay in the discontent with the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]]. The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe, especially [[Geneva]]. The Puritans objected to ornaments and ritual in the churches as [[idolatry|idolatrous]] (vestments, surplices, organs, genuflection), which they castigated as "[[Papist|popish]] pomp and rags". (See [[Vestments controversy]].) They also objected to ecclesiastical courts. They refused to endorse completely all of the ritual directions and formulas of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''; the imposition of its liturgical order by legal force and inspection sharpened Puritanism into a definite opposition movement.

The later Puritan movement were often referred to as [[dissenters]] and [[nonconformist]]s and eventually led to the formation of various [[reformed]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]].

The most famous and well-known emigration to [[United States|America]] was the migration of the Puritan separatists from the Anglican Church of England, who fled first to [[Holland]], and then later to America, to establish the English colony of [[Massachusetts]] in [[New England]], which later became one of the original [[United States]].

These Puritan separatists were also known as "the [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]]". After establishing a colony at [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]] (which became part of the colony of [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts]]) in 1620, the Puritan pilgrims received a charter from the [[King of England]] that legitimised their colony, allowing them to do trade and commerce with merchants in England, in accordance with the principles of [[mercantilism]]. This successful, though initially quite difficult, colony marked the beginning of the Protestant presence in America (the earlier French, Spanish and Portuguese settlements had been Roman Catholic), and became a kind of oasis of spiritual and [[economic freedom]], to which persecuted Protestants and other minorities from the British Isles and Europe (and later, from all over the world) fled to for peace, freedom and opportunity. The Pilgrims of [[New England]] disapproved of [[Christmas]] and celebration was outlawed in [[Boston]] from 1659 to 1681. The ban was revoked in 1681 by [[Sir Edmund Andros]], who also revoked a Puritan ban against festivities on Saturday night. Despite the removal of the ban, it wouldn't be until the middle of the 19th century that Christmas would become a popular holiday in the Boston region.<ref>{{cite web|last=Danko|first=C|title=Once Upon A Time, When Christmas Was Banned...|url=http://www.apuritansmind.com/puritan-worship/christmas-and-the-regulative-principle/once-upon-a-time-when-christmas-was-banned-by-c-danko/|work=A Puritan's mind|accessdate=1 October 2012|quote=In fact, it wasn't until the mid-1800s that celebrating Christmas became fashionable in the Boston region.}}</ref>

The original intent of the colonists was to establish spiritual Puritanism, which had been denied to them in England and the rest of Europe, to engage in peaceful commerce with England and the native [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], and to Christianize the peoples of the [[Americas]].

=== Scotland ===
{{main|Reformation in Scotland}}
{{see also|John Knox}}
[[File:John Knox preaching.JPG|thumb|Knox preaching. Detail from a stained glass window in [[St. Giles' Cathedral|St. Giles]], Edinburgh]]
The Reformation in Scotland's case culminated ecclesiastically in the establishment of a church along [[Reformed theology|reformed]] lines, and politically in the triumph of [[England|English]] influence over that of [[France]]. [[John Knox]] is regarded as the leader of the Scottish reformation

The [[Scottish Reformation Parliament|Reformation Parliament]] of 1560 repudiated the pope's authority by the [[Papal Jurisdiction Act 1560]], forbade the celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] and approved a [[Protestant]] [[Confession of Faith]]. It was made possible by a revolution against [[France|French]] hegemony under the regime of the [[regent]] [[Mary of Guise]], who had governed Scotland in the name of her absent daughter [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] (then also [[Queen consort|Queen]] of France).

The Scottish reformation decisively shaped the [[Church of Scotland]]<ref>Article 1, of the [[Articles Declaratory of the Constitution of the Church of Scotland]] 1921 states 'The Church of Scotland adheres to the Scottish reformation'.</ref> and, through it, all other [[Presbyterian]] churches worldwide.

A spiritual revival also broke out among Roman Catholics soon after Martin Luther's actions, and led to the [[Covenanter|Scottish Covenanters' movement]], the precursor to [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Presbyterianism]]. This movement spread, and greatly influenced the formation of [[Puritan]]ism among the [[Anglican Church]] in [[England]]. The Scottish covenanters were persecuted by the Roman Catholic Church. This persecution by the Catholics drove some of the Protestant covenanter leadership out of Scotland, and into [[France]] and later, [[Switzerland]].

=== France ===
{{main|Huguenot|Reformed Church of France|French Wars of Religion}}
[[File:Cardinal de Richelieu.jpg|thumb|170px|Although a Roman Catholic clergyman himself, [[Cardinal Richelieu]] allied France with Protestant states.]]
Protestantism also spread into France, where the Protestants were [[nickname]]d ''[[Huguenots]]'', and this eventually led to decades of civil warfare.

Though he was not personally interested in religious reform, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1515<U+2013>47) initially maintained an attitude of tolerance, arising from his interest in the [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist]] movement. This changed in 1534 with the [[Affair of the Placards]]. In this act, Protestants denounced the [[Catholic Mass]] in placards that appeared across France, even reaching the royal apartments. The issue of religious faith having been thrown into the arena of politics, Francis was prompted to view the movement as a threat to the kingdom's stability. This led to the first major phase of anti-Protestant persecution in France, in which the ''[[Chambre Ardente]]'' ("Burning Chamber") was established within the [[Parlement of Paris]] to deal with the rise in prosecutions for heresy. Several thousand French Protestants fled the country during this time, most notably [[John Calvin]], who settled in [[Geneva]].

Calvin continued to take an interest in the religious affairs of his native land and, from his base in Geneva, beyond the reach of the French king, regularly trained pastors to lead congregations in France. Despite heavy persecution by [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], the [[Reformed Church of France]], largely [[Calvinist]] in direction, made steady progress across large sections of the nation, in the urban [[bourgeoisie]] and parts of the [[aristocracy]], appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment.
[[File:Francois Dubois 001.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Bartholomew's Day massacre]], Painting by [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Dubois]] (born about 1529, Amiens, Picardy)]]
French Protestantism, though its appeal increased under persecution, came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the noble conversions of the 1550s. This had the effect of creating the preconditions for a series of destructive and intermittent conflicts, known as the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. The civil wars were helped along by the sudden death of [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] in 1559, which began a prolonged period of weakness for the French crown. [[Wiktionary:atrocity|Atrocity]] and outrage became the defining characteristic of the time, illustrated at its most intense in the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of August 1572, when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France.<ref>[http://home.eckerd.edu/~oberhot/paris-siege-stbarth.htm Paris and the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre: August 24, 1572]</ref> The wars only concluded when [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], himself a former Huguenot, issued the [[Edict of Nantes]], promising official toleration of the Protestant minority, but under highly restricted conditions. Roman Catholicism remained the official state religion, and the fortunes of French Protestants gradually declined over the next century, culminating in Louis XIV's [[Edict of Fontainebleau]]<U+2014>which revoked the Edict of Nantes and made Roman Catholicism the sole legal religion of France. In response to the Edict of Fontainebleau, [[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg]] declared the [[Edict of Potsdam]], giving free passage to Huguenot refugees, and tax-free status to them for ten years.

In the late 17th century, many Huguenots fled to England, the Netherlands, Prussia, Switzerland, and the English and Dutch overseas colonies. A significant community in France remained in the [[C<U+00E9>vennes]] region. A separate Protestant community, of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] faith, existed in the newly conquered province of [[Alsace]], its status not affected by the Edict of Fontainebleau.

=== Netherlands ===
{{main|History of religion in the Netherlands}}

The Reformation in the Netherlands, unlike in many other countries, was not initiated by the rulers of the [[Seventeen Provinces]], but instead by multiple popular movements, which in turn were bolstered by the arrival of Protestant refugees from other parts of the continent. While the [[Anabaptist]] movement enjoyed popularity in the region in the early decades of the Reformation, Calvinism, in the form of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], became the dominant Protestant faith in the country from the 1560s onward.

Harsh persecution of Protestants by the Spanish government of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] contributed to a desire for independence in the provinces, which led to the [[Eighty Years' War]] and eventually, the separation of the largely Protestant [[Dutch Republic]] from the Roman Catholic-dominated [[Southern Netherlands]] (present-day [[Belgium]]).

=== Hungary ===

Much of the population of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] adopted Protestantism during the 16th century. After the 1526 [[Battle of Moh<U+00E1>cs]], the Hungarian people were disillusioned by the ability of the government to protect them and turned to the faith they felt would infuse them with the strength necessary to resist the invader.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} They found this in the teaching of the Protestant reformers such as [[Martin Luther]]. The spread of Protestantism in the country was aided by its large ethnic German minority, which could understand and translate the [[Martin Luther (resources)|writings of Martin Luther]]. While Lutheranism gained a foothold among the German- and Slovak-speaking populations, [[Calvinism]] became widely accepted among ethnic Hungarians.<ref>Revesz, Imre, History of the Hungarian Reformed Church, Knight, George A.F. ed., [[Hungarian Reformed Federation of America]] (Washington, D.C.: 1956).</ref>

In the more independent northwest the rulers and priests, protected now by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], which had taken the field to fight the Turks, defended the old Roman Catholic faith. They dragged the Protestants to prison and the stake wherever they could. Such strong measures only fanned the flames of protest, however.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Leaders of the Protestants included Matthias Biro Devai, Michael Sztarai, and Stephen Kis Szegedi.

Protestants likely formed a majority of Hungary's population at the close of the 16th century, but [[Counter-Reformation]] efforts in the 17th century reconverted a majority of the kingdom to Roman Catholicism.<ref>[http://www.eldrbarry.net/heidel/eeurorsc.htm The Forgotten Reformations in Eastern Europe <U+2013> Resources<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A significant Protestant minority remained, most of it adhering to the Calvinist faith.

In 1558 the [[Transylvania]]n [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] of [[Turda]] declared free practice of both the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] religions, but prohibited [[Calvinism]]. Ten years later, in 1568, the Diet extended this freedom, declaring that "It is not allowed to anybody to intimidate anybody with captivity or expelling for his religion". Four religions ([[Unitarianism]] became official in 1583, following the faith of the only Unitarian King [[John II Sigismund Z<U+00E1>polya]] 1541-1571) were declared as accepted (recepta) religions, while [[Orthodox Christianity]] was "tolerated" (though the building of stone Orthodox churches was forbidden).
During the [[Thirty Years' War]], Royal (Habsburg) Hungary joined the Roman Catholic side, until Transylvania joined the Protestant side.

There were a series of other successful and unsuccessful anti-Habsburg (requiring equal rights and freedom for all Christian religions) uprisings between 1604 and 1711; the uprisings were usually organised from Transylvania. The constrained Habsburg Counter-Reformation efforts in the 17th century reconverted the majority of the kingdom to Roman Catholicism.

===Ireland===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
{{main|Reformation in Ireland}}
The Reformation in Ireland was a movement for the reform of religious life and institutions that was introduced into Ireland by the English administration at the behest of King Henry VIII of England. His desire for an annulment of his marriage was known as the [[King's Great Matter]]. Ultimately [[Pope Clement VII]] refused the petition; consequently it became necessary for the King to assert his lordship over the Roman Catholic Church in his realm to give legal effect to his wishes. The [[English Parliament]] confirmed the King's supremacy over the Church in the Kingdom of England. This challenge to [[Papal supremacy]] resulted in a breach with the Roman Catholic Church. By 1541, the [[Irish Parliament]] had agreed to the change in status of the country from that of a [[Lordship of Ireland|Lordship]] to that of [[Kingdom of Ireland]].

Unlike similar movements for religious reform on the continent of Europe, the various phases of the English Reformation as it developed in Ireland were largely driven by changes in government policy, to which public opinion in England gradually accommodated itself. However, a number of factors complicated the adoption of the religious innovations in Ireland; the majority of the population there adhered to the Roman Catholic Church. However in the city of [[Dublin]] the reformation took hold under the auspices of [[George Browne (Archbishop of Dublin)]].

=== Italy ===
{{main|Reformation in Italy}}
The Reformation spread to the [[Italy|Italian states]] in the 1520s, and quickly collapsed at the beginning of the 17th century. Its development was hindered by the Inquisition and also popular disdain.<ref name=riforma1>{{it icon}} [http://www.riforma.net/storia/storia41-riformainitalia.htm La Riforma in Italia] (accessed 21.06.2010)</ref> In Italy the Reformation exerted almost no lasting influence, except for strengthening the Roman Catholic Church, unlike the essential impact it had on other European countries ([[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[Bohemia]], [[Hungary]], and [[Transylvania]] among others).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Many Italians were outstanding activists of the European Reformation, mainly in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (e.g. [[Giorgio Biandrata]], [[Bernardino Ochino]], Giovanni Alciato, Giovanni Battista Cetis, [[Fausto Sozzini]], [[Francesco Stancaro]] and [[Giovanni Valentino Gentile]]) who propagated [[Nontrinitarianism]] there and were chief instigators of the movement of [[Polish Brethren]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In 1532 the [[Waldensians]] adhered to the Reformation, adopting the Calvinist theology. So, their [[Waldensian Church|Church]], survived in the [[Western Alps]] through many persecutions, has been for centuries the only Protestant Church in Italy.

In Italy the Biblical Unitarian Movement powered by the ideas of Sozzini and others<ref name="cf. SocinianismServetus">cf. [[Socinianism]] [[Servetus]]</ref> is represented today by the churches associated with the [[Christian Church in Italy]].<ref>cf.

From the analysis of documents that you can find on the official site of the CCI,<ref name="Sito-CCI">[http://www.chiesadifrosinone.it Chiesa Cristiana di Frosinone], Una delle Chiese o gruppi associati alla CCI.</ref><ref name="Chiesa Cristiana in Italia">[http://www.chiesacristianainitalia.it Chiesa Cristiana in Italia]</ref> it is clear that the doctrinal position of this Christian confession of faith is therefore akin to the so-called Biblical Unitarian movement<ref name="Christadelphians">[[Christadelphians]]</ref><ref name="Socinianism">[[Socinianism]]</ref><ref name="Polish Brethren">[[Polish Brethren]]</ref> and on the other hand, far from that of [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] who, although they have the same origin in 1500 AD, through the centuries have suffered the influence of many non-biblical ideas (cf. [[Universalism]]).
The Christian Church in Italy has significant similarities with the Biblical Unitarian movement, although it maintains a cautious position on some doctrinal points. Wilbur wrote about the Unitarian Movement: "The religious movement whose history we are endeavoring to trace...became fully developed in thought and polity in only four countries, one after another, namely Poland, Transylvania, England and America. But in each of these it showed, along with certain individual characteristics, a general spirit, a common point of view, and a doctrinal pattern that tempt one to regard them as all outgrowths of a single movement which passed from one to another; for nothing could be more natural than to presume that these common features implied a common ancestry. Yet such is not the fact, for in each of these four lands the movement, instead of having originated elsewhere, and been translated only after attaining mature growth, appears to have sprung independently and directly from its own native roots, and to have been influenced by other and similar movements only after it had already developed an independent life and character of its own.".<ref>Earl Morse Wilbur, A History of Unitarianism, vol. 2 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1952), p. 166.</ref> From the analysis of documents that you can find on the official site of the CCI,<ref name="Sito-CCI"/><ref name="Chiesa Cristiana in Italia"/> it is clear that the doctrinal position of this Christian confession of faith is therefore akin to the so-called Biblical Unitarian movement <ref name="Christadelphians"/><ref name="Socinianism"/><ref name="Polish Brethren"/> and on the other hand, far from that of [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] who, although they have the same origin in 1500 AD, through the centuries, have suffered the influence of many non-biblical ideas (cf.

Robinson, The Unitarians and the Universalists, Greenwood Press, 1985, pp. 3, 17).</ref>

=== Polish <U+2013> Lithuanian Commonwealth ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
In the first half of the 16th century, the enormous [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was a country of many creeds, but Roman Catholic Church remained the dominating religion. Reformation reached Poland in the 1520s, and quickly gained popularity among mostly German-speaking inhabitants of such major cities, as [[Gda<U+0144>sk]], [[Toru<U+0144>]] and [[Elbl<U+0105>g]]. In [[Koenigsberg]], in 1530, Polish-language edition of [[Luther's Small Catechism]] was published. The [[Duchy of Prussia]], which was a Polish [[fief]], emerged as key center of the movement, with numerous publishing houses issuing not only Bibles, but also catechisms, in German, Polish and Lithuanian.

[[Lutheranism]] gained popularity in northern part of the country, while [[Calvinism]] caught the interest of [[szlachta]], mainly in [[Lesser Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Several publishing houses were opened in Lesser Poland in mid-16th century, in such locations, as [[S<U+0142>omniki]] and [[Rak<U+00F3>w, Kielce County|Rak<U+00F3>w]]. At that time, [[Mennonite]]s and [[Unity of the Brethren|Czech Brothers]] came to Poland, with the latter ones settling mostly in [[Greater Poland]], around [[Leszno]]. In 1565, [[Polish Brethren]] appeared as yet another reformation movement.

The 16th century Commonwealth was unique in Europe, because of widespread tolerance, confirmed by the [[Warsaw Confederation]]. In 1563, the [[Brest Bible]] was published (see also [[Bible translations into Polish]]). The period of tolerance ended during the reign of King [[Sigismund III Vasa]], who was under strong influence of [[Piotr Skarga]] and other [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]. After the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]], and other wars of the mid-17th century, in which all enemies of Poland were either Protestant or Orthodox Christians, the attitude of Poles changed. [[Counter-Reformation]] prevailed, in 1658 Polish Brethren were forced to leave the country, and in 1666, the [[Sejm]] banned [[apostasy]] from Catholicism to any other religion, under punishment of death. Finally, in 1717, the [[Silent Sejm]] banned non-Catholics from becoming deputies of the Parliament.

Among most important Protestants of the Commonwealth, there are such names, as [[Miko<U+0142>aj Rej]], [[Marcin Czechowic]], [[Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski]] and [[Symon Budny]].

===Slovene Lands===

[[Jurij Dalmatin]], another important Slovene Lutheran minister, writer and translator, is most notable for the complete [[translation]] of the [[Bible]] into [[Slovene language|Slovene]], his most important achievement. He allegedly wrote it to a large extent at [[Turjak Castle]] under the protection of the [[Carniolan honey bee|Carniolan]] governor, Herbard VIII von Auersperg (Slovene: Hervard Turja<U+0161>ki), and Herbard's son Christoph von Auersperg, who are said to have provided for the translator Dalmatin a "Wartburg"-type sanctuary as had been offered to [[Martin Luther]] by Frederick the Wise, the Elector of Saxony. This, however, is refuted as pure legend.

The original title of Damatin's 1584 Bible translation was ''Bibilija, tu je vse svetu pismu stariga inu noviga testamenta, slovenski tolma<U+010D>ena skuzi Jurija Dalmatina'' (''The Bible: That Is, the Entire Holy Scripture of the Old and the New Testament, Translated into Slovene by Jurij Dalmatin''). The translation set the norm for the Slovene [[standard language]] (with later innovations in vocabulary) until the first half of the 19th century. He was also the author of several religious books, such as the 1584 ''Kar<U+0161>anske lepe molitve'' (''Beautiful Christian Prayers''), the 1585 ''Ta kratki w<U+00FC>rtember<U+0161>ki katekizmus'' (''The Short W<U+00FC>rttemberg Catechism'', and ''Agenda'' published in 1589.

== Conclusion and legacy ==

The Reformation led to a [[European wars of religion|series of religious wars]] that culminated in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618<U+2013>1648), which devastated much of [[Early Modern history of Germany|Germany]], killing between 25 and 40% of its population.<ref>"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics#ref=ref310375 History of Europe <U+2013> Demographics]". Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica.</ref> From 1618 to 1648 the Roman Catholic [[House of Habsburg]] and its allies fought against the Protestant princes of Germany, supported at various times by [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[France]]. The Habsburgs, who ruled [[Spain]], [[Austria]], [[Slovene Lands]], the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and much of [[Germany]] and [[Italy]], were staunch defenders of the Roman Catholic Church. Some historians believe that the era of the Reformation came to a close when Roman Catholic France allied itself, first in secret and later on the battlefields, with Protestant states against the Habsburg dynasty.{{sfn|Simon|1966|pp=120-121}} For the first time since the days of Luther, political and national convictions again outweighed religious convictions in Europe.

The main tenets of the [[Peace of Westphalia]], which ended the Thirty Years' War, were:

* All parties would now recognise the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555, by which each prince would have the right to determine the religion of his own state, the options being Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, and now Calvinism (the principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'')<ref name="westphal">[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/westphal.htm The Avalon Project: Treaty of Westphalia]</ref>
* Christians living in principalities where their denomination was ''not'' the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will.<ref name="westphal" />

The treaty also effectively ended the Pope's pan-European political power. Fully aware of the loss, [[Pope Innocent X]] declared the treaty "null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all times." European sovereigns, Roman Catholic and Protestant alike, ignored his verdict.<ref name="Simon-120-121">{{cite book |first=Edith |last=Simon |title=Great Ages of Man: The Reformation |pages=120<U+2013>121 |publisher=Time-Life Books |year=1966 |isbn=0-662-27820-8}}</ref>

However, this treaty did not mean that the Reformation concluded. It would be about another century (ca. 1750) before the Reformation could truly be considered to have ended. Meanwhile, other reform movements continued to spring up, even within the Reformation churches. One such movement was [[Pietism]], which impacted the Low Countries (hence the Reformed churches), Germany (hence also Lutheranism), and Great Britain, which lead to a split in Lutheranism and which brought about the creation of some new churches (most notably the [[Moravian Church]] and [[Methodism]]). In turn, Pietism would branch out into a "normative" form and [[Radical Pietism]].

Further impact on the Reformation came from the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and its preponderance of [[Rationalism]]. This would lead to redefined roles for religion, eventually relegating it to second-class status.
