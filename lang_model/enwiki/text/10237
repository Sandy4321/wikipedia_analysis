'''King's Highway 12''', commonly referred to as '''Highway 12''', is a [[Highways in Ontario|provincially maintained highway]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]]. The highway connects the eastern end of the [[Greater Toronto Area]] (GTA) with [[Kawartha Lakes]] (via [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway&nbsp;7]]), [[Orillia]] and [[Midland, Ontario|Midland]]. It forms a part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] system from north of [[Sunderland, Ontario|Sunderland]] to [[Coldwater, Ontario|Coldwater]]. Highway 12 connects several small towns along its {{convert|146|km|abbr=on}} route, and [[bypass (road)|bypasses]] a short distance from many others. The rural portions of the highway feature a posted speed limit of {{convert|80|km/h|abbr=on}}, often dropping to {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}} through built-up areas. The entire route is patrolled by the [[Ontario Provincial Police]].

Highway 12 was first established in 1920 between [[Ontario Highway 2|Highway 2]] in Whitby and [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]]. The section running east from Sutherland became part of Highway 7 before route numbering came into effect in 1925. Highway 12 was then routed through [[Beaverton, Ontario|Beaverton]] and around the eastern and northern shores of [[Lake Simcoe]] to Orillia and later to Midland. The section south of Brooklin was transferred to the [[Regional Municipality of Durham]] in mid-1997 and redesignated as [[Durham Regional Highway 12]].

just south of the community of [[Brooklin, Ontario|Brooklin]] in the town of [[Whitby, Ontario|Whitby]].<ref name="km" /><!-- The MTO mileage logs notes Spencer Street, which is 300 metres south of the signs denoting the start of Highway 12 -->
It travels north and joins with [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway 7]] on the southern edge of Brooklin. Highway 7 runs west to [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], and is signed [[concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with Highway 12 for {{convert|39.1|km|abbr=on}} north of this point. North of Sunderland, Highway 7 separates and travels east to Lindsay; and Highway 12 becomes part of the Central Ontario Route of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] at this location.<ref name="2010 mapart" />

The highway then follows the eastern and northern shores of [[Lake Simcoe]], bypassing [[Beaverton, Ontario|Beaverton]] and curving to the northwest towards Orillia. It bypasses Orillia, and shares routing with [[Ontario Highway 11 (Ontario)|Highway 11]] northwards for about two kilometres between [[interchange (road)|interchanges]] 131 and 133. At the latter interchange, Highway 12 then heads northwest towards [[Coldwater, Ontario|Coldwater]], where it routes onto [[Ontario Highway 400|Highway&nbsp;400]] between interchanges 141 and 147.<ref name="2010 mapart" />

At [[Waubaushene, Ontario|Waubaushene]], the Trans-Canada Highway follows Highway 400 north to [[Parry Sound, Ontario|Parry Sound]] and [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], while Highway 12 continues west towards [[Tay, Ontario|Victoria Harbour]], [[Port McNicoll, Ontario|Port McNicoll]], and the [[Martyrs' Shrine]].<ref name="2010 mapart" /> The highway ends at a junction with Highway 93 at the western town limits of Midland.<ref name="km" />

== History ==
[[File:Beginning of 12 future 407.png|thumb|right|The southern terminus of Highway&nbsp;12 lies immediately south of [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway&nbsp;7]]. This is also the future location of an interchange with [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway&nbsp;407 East]].<ref name="future407" />]]
The oldest portion of Highway&nbsp;12 was originally known as the Coldwater Portage and later the Coldwater Road, connecting the modern sites of Orillia and Coldwater by a {{convert|14|mi|abbr=on}} trail. [[Upper Canada]] Governor [[John Colborne]] surveyed the portage in 1830 and ordered it to be widened for wagon use. As the area was settled and an increasing need for land connection with the south arose, a new road was proposed from Whitby to Sturgeon Bay. In February 1843, the residents formally petitioned the government to construct the route. The Sturgeon Bay Road, from Coldwater to Sturgeon Bay, was opened as a rough wagon road in 1844. The Atherley Narrows, separating Lake Simcoe from Lake Couchiching, were surveyed in the early 1840s and the first causeway and bridge constructed in the years that followed. The portion of the route between Whitby and Orillia, however, was still under construction during the second half of the decade.<ref>{{cite book

The route followed the present&ndash;day Highway 12 from Whitby to Sunderland, then travelled east to Lindsay.<ref name="Shragge74" />

Highway assumptions carried out on June&nbsp;22 and July&nbsp;2, 1927, extended Highway&nbsp;7 east from Brampton to Peterborough. In doing so, it became [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with Highway&nbsp;12 between Whitby and Sunderland. The route of Highway 12 between Sunderland and Lindsay was renumbered as part of Highway 7 at this time. Highway 12 was later extended north to Orillia, via Beaverton. This was accomplished through two assumptions. on August&nbsp;17, the majority of the route through [[Brock, Ontario|Brock]], [[Thorah, Ontario|Thorah]] and [[Mara, Ontario|Mara]] Townships was assumed. Several more miles were assumed on December&nbsp;28, 1927, extending Highway&nbsp;12 as far as Orillia.<ref>{{cite report

The majority of the route paralleled an existing railway that was constructed over a native [[portage]].

Highway&nbsp;12 remained unaltered for several decades, until the mid 1960s, when the Beaverton Bypass was constructed. On November&nbsp;4, 1966, the {{convert|10.3|km|abbr=on}} bypass opened,<ref>{{cite book

The highway again remained unchanged for several decades, until a short portion of the southern end of the highway was decommissioned in the late 1990s. On April&nbsp;1, 1997, the portions of Highway&nbsp;12 south of Brooklin were transferred to the [[Regional Municipality of Durham]], which subsequently redesignated the road as [[Durham Regional Highway 12]].<ref name="downloaded">{{cite report
