'''Birkenhead Public Library''' (''Te Whare Matauranga o Birkenhead'' in [[M<U+0101>ori language|M<U+0101>ori]]) is part of the [[North Shore Libraries]] system on [[Auckland]]'s [[North Shore]]. Founded in 1949 it predominantly serves the areas of [[Birkenhead, New Zealand|Birkenhead]], Beachhaven, Birkdale, Kauri Park, Chelsea, and Birkenhead East, a population of about 26,000, including six [[primary school]]s, two [[intermediate school|intermediate]], and two [[secondary education|colleges]].<ref>Fisher, Muriel and Hilder, Wenman. (1969). ''Birkenhead: the kauri suburb,'' Birkenhead: Birkenhead Borough Council, p. 101.</ref><ref>Statistics New Zealand. (2006). [http://xtabs.stats.govt.nz/eng/statsbyarea/area_main.asp?rc=02&ta=005 ''Community Profiles''] accessed Feb 2007.</ref>

Typical of small [[public library|public libraries]] in [[New Zealand]] it is able to provide an extensive range of modern library [[Public library#Services offered|resources and services]] through its integration into a wider urban network, and through its association with the [[National Library of New Zealand|National Library]]; while nevertheless retaining its own distinct, local connections such as the [http://www.shorelibraries.govt.nz/Collections/Birkenhead/ChelseaArchives.php Archives Collection] of the [[Chelsea Sugar Refinery]].

Though small Birkenhead Public has a significant history. It was the first public library to be founded in North Shore City, the first to offer [[dial-up access]] to the New Zealand [[Bibliographic]] Network, and a leading proponent of full weekend services.<ref>Graham, Rata. (1992). ''Birkenhead Library: a history, ''Birkenhead: North Shore Libraries, pp. 1-3.</ref><ref>"Computer links Birkenhead to library network," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Jan 28, 1986, p. 3.</ref>

Currently, Birkenhead Public is located in temporary quarters in the Birkenhead Leisure Centre, while the dispute over the location and design of its new building is resolved.<ref>Watson, Ben. "Waiting game for reserve appeal," ''North Shore Times'', Jun 9, 2006, p. 6.</ref>

==History==
The history of Birkenhead Public Library is characterized by four transformations which have occurred at approximately twenty year intervals since its founding in 1949. Three of these transformations involved new buildings; while the other involved [[Consolidation (business)|amalgamation]] into the wider North Shore Libraries system. There has also been an unintended interim period when the library was based at the Leisure Centre.

===Founding of the Library===
At the turn of the twentieth century, apart from "[[subscription libraries]]" the only library in Birkenhead was run by the Zion Hill [[Methodist]] Church. In 1901, the Birkenhead [[Borough Council]] had resolved that its legal and finance committee should consider building a public one, but little eventuated.<ref>Fisher, Muriel and Hilder, Wenman. (1969). ''Birkenhead: the kauri suburb,'' Birkenhead: Birkenhead Borough Council, p. 102.</ref><ref> Haddon, Kathy. (1993). ''Birkenhead: the way we were'', Birkenhead: North Shore City Council, p. 45.</ref>

[[Public library#Funding problem|Funding]] proved to be the issue. A subsidy of <U+00A3>100 was sought from the government in 1904 for a building "not to exceed a total of <U+00A3>600;"<ref>Fisher, Muriel and Hilder, Wenman. (1969). ''Birkenhead: the kauri suburb,'' Birkenhead: Birkenhead Borough Council, p. 101.</ref> yet in 1934 the ''[[Auckland Star]]'' could still report on dissent at a Birkenhead Borough Council meeting. When John MacDonald spoke out that <U+201C>It is a poor town that has no public library<U+201D> the then mayor, George Mills, retorted "that it would be an easy matter to start a library if the ratepayers provided the money."<ref>"News of the Day: Library for Birkenhead," ''The Auckland Star'', May, 31 1934, in ''Extracts from the Birkenhead City Council scrapbook'', compiled by Colleen Christie, p. 2.</ref>

Yet, in 1949, the Free Birkenhead Public Library was established in the basement of the Council Chambers, opening on November 14. It was a modest beginning, bolstered by support from the National Library. There was an initial budget of <U+00A3>500. The library began with a collection of around 1500 items, "swelled by about another twenty books a month."<ref>"The last word in library service," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Apr 26, 1968, p. 6.</ref><ref>Reed, Kim. "Reserve zone change on the books," ''North Shore Times'', Sep 29, 2005, p. 3.</ref>

===The Civic Reserve Library===
[[Image:BirkenheadLibrary2005.jpg|thumb|260px|right|<small>Front entrance. The library was on the ground floor, with a [[mezzanine]] balcony along one side.</small>]]
After the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] was opened in 1959 the Birkenhead area became much more accessible.<ref> Titchener, Paul. (1982). 'The naming of Birkenhead,' ''Beginnings'' vol. 6, p. 36</ref><ref>Christie, Colleen. (1989) ''Birkenhead: a brief account,'' Birkenhead: Birkenhead Public Library, p. 3.</ref> By the mid 1960s issues each year had increased dramatically by nearly a hundred thousand items.<ref>Fisher, Muriel and Hilder, Wenman. (1969). ''Birkenhead: the kauri suburb'', Birkenhead: Birkenhead Borough Council, p. 101.</ref>

Nora Bourke, the Chairman of the Library Committee, felt the existing building was limited and with mayor Cyril Crocombe began making plans for a much larger building. This was to be a purpose-built construction modelled on the [[Glen Innes, New Zealand|Glen Innes]] Library. 

On 20 April 1968 the new building was officially opened by the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor General]] [[Arthur Porritt]].<ref>"New page in Birkenhead history," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Apr 26, 1968, p. 4</ref><ref>Christie, Colleen. (1988). ''Back then: oral history interviews from the Birkenhead Public Library collection'', vol 3, pp. 23-25.</ref> In his speech the mayor declared "the library will attract students from all over the North Shore... and it will make Birkenhead the cultural centre of Auckland city's north harbour."<ref>"New page in Birkenhead history," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Apr 26, 1968, p. 4.</ref> Certainly it became well-established. For thirty-seven years this was to remain the location of the Birkenhead Public Library, and in 1979 the [[park|reserve]] was renamed after the first librarian, Eleanor - "Nell" - Fisher.<ref>Reed, Kim. "Reserve zone change on the books," ''North Shore Times'', Sep 29, 2005, p. 3.</ref>

In 1992 issues topped 300,000 items.<ref>Graham, Rata. (1992). ''Birkenhead library: a history'', Birkenhead: North Shore Libraries, p. 8.</ref> By 2003 usage of the library had increased still further, to such an extent that it was noticeably affecting service delivery.<ref>"Birkenhead Library gets $1m expansion," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Aug 23, 2001, p. 11.</ref> Over 500 people a day were entering the library and new members were growing at a rate of 150 per month. Finding room to add new material to the existing stock of some 67,500 items was becoming increasingly difficult.<ref>"Library list of woes make sad reading," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Jun 10, 2003, p. 1.</ref>

[[Image:BirkenheadLibraryInside2005.jpg|thumb|240px|left|<small>Interior of the library, showing about a third of the collection.</small>]]
Another important factor driving the need for change was the absence of enough space for various community groups, such as primary schools and students,<ref>"Birkenhead Library gets $1m expansion," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Aug 23, 2001, p. 11.</ref> [[Book discussion club|bookclubs]],<ref>"Booktalk group," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', May 20, 2003.</ref> and author events.<ref>"Handbooks presented to librarian," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', May 14, 2003.</ref> In terms of a modern technological infrastructure, the old building simply couldn't cope. The City Librarian, Geoff Chamberlain, recognised that it had become "the least attractive of the city's libraries." Sharron Cleghorn, the [[project manager]], saw the need for a place "people would want to visit."<ref>"Library list of woes make sad reading," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Jun 10, 2003, p. 1.</ref> By the end of the 1990s some sort of addition to the library was being actively considered.

===Amalgamation===
[[Image:NorthShoreLibrariesAmalgamation.jpg|thumb|right|220px|<small>North Shore Libraries at amalgamation.</small>]]
The 1980s saw an increase in the depth and variety of services offered. A [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford van]]<ref>Graham, Rata. (1992). ''Birkenhead Library: A history'', Birkenhead: North Shore Libraries, pp. 1-2.</ref> was used to start a [[mobile library]] service in 1982, and the library began opening on Saturdays in 1983. In 1986, children<U+2019>s [[multimedia]] items were offered for the first time, and the New Zealand Bibliographic Network link was established. Soon after [[compact disc]]s were made available; while in 1987 the library began opening on Sundays. So service was now provided over the entire week, a first in New Zealand.<ref>Graham, Rata. (1992). ''Birkenhead Library: A history'', Birkenhead: North Shore Libraries, pp. 2-5.</ref> 

Notable too in the late eighties, was the processing of books to create "[[MARC standards|machine readable codes]],"<ref>Graham, Rata. (1992). ''Birkenhead Library: A history,'' Birkenhead: North Shore Libraries, p. 3.</ref> which saw the catalogue shifted from [[card catalogue|card]] to [[microfiche]].<ref>''North Shore Times Advertiser'', "Computer links Birkenhead to library network," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Jan 28, 1986, p. 3.</ref> Borrowers were now directly registered onto the computer, and a new [[integrated library system|computer management system]] went live, "the most sophisticated...in the world."<ref>Graham, Rata. (1992). ''Birkenhead Library: A history'', Birkenhead: North Shore Libraries, p. 4.</ref> This was a forerunner of the greater computerisation ahead, including the introduction of [[self-issue machines]] in 1995 (pictured), internet access in 1996 and a widening range of [[Bibliographic database|electronic resources]] from 2002.<ref>"New system for library," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', 12 Dec 1995, p. 3.</ref><ref>"Library surfs the internet," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Sep 19, 1996, p. 38.</ref><ref>Carmichael, Nikki. "The world's at your fingertips via libraries," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', May 3, 2002.</ref>

[[Image:BirkenheadLibrary SelfIssueMachine.jpg|thumb|left|<small>Welcome to the self-issue machine. First introduced to Birkenhead Library in 1995, this is a later version.</small>]]
However, perhaps the most significant event of the eighties was [[Birkenhead, New Zealand|amalgamation]] of the Birkenhead and Northcote Boroughs, and the subsequent merging of the local libraries into the North Shore Libraries system in 1989 (pictured).<ref>Norsburgh, Megan. "Supercity swears in its mayors and councillors," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Oct 31, 1989, p. 3.</ref> Staff were redeployed and regional development was initiated. A new division, [[library technical services|Technical Services]], became fully operational at [[Takapuna]]. A Children<U+2019>s Services Co-ordinator was appointed, and the computer management system established the year before was improved to allow [[OPAC|universal access]] to the six libraries<U+2019> holdings.<ref>Graham, Rata. (1992). ''Birkenhead Library: A history'', Birkenhead: North Shore Libraries, p. 5</ref><ref>Christie, Colleen. (1989) ''Birkenhead: A brief account'', Birkenhead: Birkenhead Public Library, p. 4.</ref><ref>"Library celebrates seven day service," ''North Shore Times'', 17 May 2005, p. 11.</ref>

This convergence has continued to this day with the advent of the "eLGAR" conglomerate, the Libraries of the Greater [[Auckland Region]].<ref>The [http://www.elgar.govt.nz/screens/mainmenu2.html eLGAR website] is simply the grouping of all the constituents catalogues. However, in December 2007 they started the [http://elgarpo.blogspot.com/ eLGAR Blog] which aims to be more informative.</ref> Birkenhead Library (as part of the North Shore Libraries system) began a public rollout of the eLGAR Smarter System on [[June 16]] [[2005]].<ref> Bethell, Michelle.

On [[May 1]] [[2000]], a [[time capsule]] was buried out in front of the library, by the Birkenhead [[war memorial]]. It contained various items such as maps, driver's licences, shopping receipts, and old library cards from the 1960s and 1970s. Blessed by a [[kaumatua]] from Awataha [[Marae]] it was planned to be dug up in one hundred years. On the plaque are quoted the opening two lines from [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem [[Burnt Norton]].<ref>Le Bas, Natalia. 'Historic moment in time," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', May 9, 2000, p. 11.</ref>

===The Leisure Centre Library===
[[Image:BkhLibraryInteriorSouth.jpg|thumb|275px|right|<small>Library in Leisure Centre, facing south.</small>]]
In 2005 the library was shifted to a converted basketball court in the Birkenhead Leisure Centre in Mahara Avenue (pictured).  Other alternative sites had been considered, but most were found to be either inappropriate or too expensive.<ref>[http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/your_council/agendas_minutes/community-services-parks/csp-min-090904.pdf ''Report of a meeting: Community Services & Parks Committee''], North Shore City Council, Sep 9, 2004.</ref> With limited space available for services the Plunkett, CAB and council Area Office had to find alternative premises.<ref>"Area office on the move," ''North Shore Times'', Apr 5, 2005, p. 12</ref><ref>"CAB moves ranks while library is demolished," ''North Shore Times'',May 31, 2005, p. 34.</ref> In fact only 50% to 60% of the library's own stock could be accommodated.<ref>[http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/your_council/agendas_minutes/community-services-parks/csp-min-090904.pdf ''Report of a meeting: Community Services & Parks Committee''], North Shore City Council, Sep 9, 2004.</ref> 

$175,000 was budgeted for the fitout of the basketball court,<ref>[http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/your_council/agendas_minutes/community-services-parks/2005/CSP-min-140405.pdf ''Report of a meeting: Community Services & Parks Committee''], North Shore City Council, Apr 14, 2005.</ref> and included such things as improved lighting, car park access, and funding for a passenger lift to allow for disabled patrons.<ref>[http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/your_council/agendas_minutes/community-services-parks/csp-min-301104.pdf ''Report of a meeting: Community Services & Parks Committee''], North Shore City Council, Nov 30, 2004.</ref><ref>[http://www.shorelibraries.govt.nz/Locations/Birkenhead/ Birkenhead Library webpage], North Shore Libraries.

However, in the event, the library remained at this temporary location for a number of years.<ref>See [[Birkenhead_Public_Library#Controversy_over_the_new_building|Controversy over the new building]]</ref> 
[[Image:BkhLibraryInteriorNorth.jpg|thumb|275px|left|<small>Library in Leisure Centre, facing north.</small>]]
The Leisure Centre is located in the Birkenhead War Memorial Park, which contains various other buildings and amenities such as sports clubs, sports grounds, a swimming pool and a skatepark. In the areas adjacent to the library there were problems associated with youth drinking and graffiti, and other undesirable behaviour.<ref>[http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/your_council/agendas_minutes/2006/Community-board/Birkenhead-Northcote/BNC-Com-brd-mins-August08-06.pdf ''Minutes of a meeting of the Birkenhead-Northcote Community Board Community Services Committee''], North Shore City Council, Aug 8, 2006.</ref> The carpark was chained off,<ref>[http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/your_council/agendas_minutes/2006/Community-board/Birkenhead-Northcote/Birkenhead-northcote-csp-comm-mins-Sept-12-2006.pdf ''Minutes of a meeting of the Birkenhead-Northcote Community Board Community Services Committe''], North Shore City Council, Sep 6, 2006.</ref> and an alcohol ban was sought.<ref>[http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/your_council/agendas_minutes/2007/Community-boards/Birkenhead-Northcote/Birkenhead-Northcote-community-services-committee-mins-May-8-2007.pdf ''Minutes of a meeting of the Birkenhead-Northcote Community Board Community Services Committe''], North Shore City Council, May 8, 2006.</ref> In 2007, the War Memorial Park was identified as a "crime hotspot."<ref>[http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/your_council/agendas_minutes/2007/CSP/Community-services-parks-mins-June-14-2007.pdf ''Report of a meeting: Community Services & Parks Committee''], North Shore City Council, Jun 14, 2007.</ref> Meanwhile, patronage of the library since relocation had dropped by 35%.<ref>Reed, Kim.

===The Modern Community Library===
[[Image:SignofNewBirkeheadLibrary.jpg|thumb|200px|right|<small>One of several Council signs around the Nell Fisher reserve. Note also, the artist's impression of the first version of the new library.</small>]]
Brendan Rawson, from the Architecture Office <ref>http://www.archoffice.co.nz</ref> in [[Ponsonby, New Zealand|Ponsonby]], was retained in 2004 to design a building that would create the much needed [[public space]]; and in addition, reflect the heritage of the area.<ref>This is the first recorded meeting. [http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/your_council/agendas_minutes/community-services-parks/csp-min-120804.pdf ''Report of a meeting: Community Services & Parks Committee''], North Shore City Council, Aug 12, 13, 24, 2004.</ref> Initial concepts took advantage of the considerable potential for views, and incorporated extensive additional landscaping, from more trees to poppies.<ref>'[http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/your_council/agendas_minutes/community-services-parks/csp-min-301104.pdf 'Report of a meeting: Community Services & Parks Committee''], North Shore City Council, Nov 30, 2004.</ref> The first completed design, (pictured), evoked the [[kauri]] that were once endemic to the region.<ref>Reed, Kim. "Deadline looms for library plan feedback," ''North Shore Times'', Feb 22, 2005, p. 11.</ref> Shadow-patterns of branches etched on the windows were reminiscent of the trees in the reserve, one of which was itself a kauri, planted in 1987 to commemorate environmentalist Bill Fisher.<ref>"Kauri tree planted in reserve," ''North Shore Times Advertiser,'' Aug 11, 1987, p. 17.</ref> There was also to be a cafe on the second floor and a drive-thru at basement level for dropping off returns. This version was planned to be two metres higher than the previous building, with 1200 m<sup>2</sup> of floorspace set aside for the library.

Put out to public scrutiny there was some negative feedback. Peter White, a local resident, was critical of the design, calling the building "strange...full of different angles." Community board member Tony Holman wanted more thought put into the heritage aspects, though he did not specify any details. The [[Birkenhead Library#Support groups|Friends of the Library]], on the other hand, were unanimous in their praise.<ref>Reed, Kim. "Deadline looms for library plan feedback," ''North Shore Times'', Feb 22, 2005, p. 11.</ref>

Another important aspect of the design was that it would also be a [[Sustainable architecture|sustainable building]]. This commitment to the environment is an increasingly significant part of [[North Shore City Council]]'s approach to [[urban development]], especially through the [[Resource Management Act]] and the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].<ref>North Shore City Council. [http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/your_council/about_council.htm "About North Shore City Council"], ''North Shore City Council'', undated. Accessed Jan 2, 2007; North Shore City Council.

Accessed Jan 2, 2007.</ref> The library design incorporated several notable features, including the maximisation of [[Lighting#Energy consumption|natural light]], the use of [[recycling|recyclable material]], including reuse of [[grey water]], and a [[Sustainable architecture#Heating.2C Ventilation and Cooling System Efficiency|natural ventilation and cooling system]] to limit [[Low-energy house|energy costs]].<ref>Reed, Kim. "Deadline looms for library plan feedback," ''North Shore Times'', Feb 22, 2005, p. 11.</ref> 

After the Environment Court decision (see below) this design underwent some modification.

==Controversy over the new building==
In preparation for a new community library complex the old building was demolished in May 2005. The library service was temporarily relocated to a basketball court in the Birkenhead [[Leisure Centre]]. It was expected to be there for eighteen months.  However, the project was then delayed for several years; and is now not expected to be finished until 2009.

===Cost of delays===
[[Image:ViewBirkenheadLibrarysite.jpg|thumb|300px|right|<small>View from Birkenhead Library site. The library building is sited further forward, approximately on the brown patch of mown grass. Proposed levels would have given public access to even more expansive views encompassing the [[Hauraki Gulf]], [[Sky Tower]], and [[Mt Eden]] etc.</small>]]
The initial focus of the library project was on upgrading the existing quarters. For this purpose the North Shore City Council allocated $1 million in its 2001 draft [[District Plan|annual plan]], to be spread over two years. This would have allowed for the incorporation of the lobby into the floorplan, and the shifting of various facilities into better positions, such as bringing the [[Citizens Advice Bureau]] downstairs and reconfiguring the second level to take a [[Learning Resource Centre|computer and homework centre]]. Sharron Cleghorn, the project manager, also hoped to provide a public reading room to take advantage of the "spectacular views" (pictured).<ref>"Birkenhead Library gets $1m expansion," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Aug 23, 2001, p. 11.</ref> 

When the second floor was built on top of the library in the early 1970s it initially housed the Council Area Office,<ref>White & White Ltd. ''North Shore City Council Birkenhead building feasibility study''. Tauranga: White & White Ltd, 2000, p. 4.</ref> though it was conceived even then that it would eventually be used as a library space.<ref>Christie, Colleen. (1988). ''Back then: oral history interviews from the Birkenhead Public Library collection'', Birkenhead: Birkenhead City Council, vol 3, p. 25.</ref> However, investigations in 1999 by engineers revealed that the second level floor was too weak to support the weight of books without significant strengthening, which would be expensive to undertake. As well, the existing building was showing increasing signs of deterioration, particularly a leaking ceiling. While it could be repaired, maintenance over time would negate the short-term cost advantage of doing so. Thus, the option of a completely new building was brought under consideration.<ref>"Library list of woes make sad reading," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Jun 10, 2003, p. 1.</ref><ref>Le Bas, Natalie. "Manager supports new library for Birkenhead," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Mar 28, 2002, p. 28;</ref>

In 2000 a feasibility study considered four options: demolition, refurbishment, ground floor extensions, or extensions to both levels. Demolition and reconstruction was estimated at $3.3 million, cheaper than extending both floors at $3.7m, though nearly twice the cost of refurbishment. The study noted that the site comprised five lots whose exact boundaries were unclear. It also acknowledged the demolition and reconstruction option would require a land use consent application, as the new building would exceed height and coverage restrictions.<ref>White & White Ltd. ''North Shore City Council Birkenhead building feasibility study''. Tauranga: White & White Ltd, 2000, p. 3.</ref>

In March 2002 the City Librarian Geoff Chamberlain presented that report to the council, with the first option being the preferred choice by the library services. It would increase the size of the building to 1600 m<sup>2</sup>, 1200 m<sup>2</sup> of which would be devoted to the library itself, with the additional space being used for the Council Area Office and the Citizens Advice Bureau.<ref>Le Bas, Natalie. "Manager supports new library for Birkenhead," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Mar 28, 2002, p. 28.</ref>

A year later, in June 2003, demolition and reconstruction was the confirmed preference. Costs were projected for the next year's draft annual plan. This included a $100,000 in the first year for design and planning, $900,000 in the next, and $4.5 million for the building itself.<ref>"A new library on the books," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Jun 19, 2003, p. 1.</ref> By mid 2004 the concept had been finalised, and the detailed design was being worked on for presentation to the community boards, and for public consultation.<ref>''North Shore Times'', "Library work set to start," ''North Shore Times'', Jul 16, 2004, p. 3.</ref>

On [[February 23]] [[2005]] public submissions closed, and a fitout of the temporary site in the Leisure Centre was begun.<ref>"Deadline looms for library plan feedback," ''North Shore Times'', Feb 22, 2005, p. 11.</ref> Total cost for the new library was now expected to be $6.5 million,<ref>[http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/your_council/news_releases/releases-05/April/Libraries_bigger_than_books.htm "Libraries bigger than books"], North Shore City Council, Apr 18, 2005.</ref> then $7.3 million.<ref>Lotter, Michelle. "Library delays cost $2.2m," ''North Shore Times'', Dec 6, 2007.</ref> The project was then delayed, requiring a change to the district plan (see below). In late 2005, the Council Community Services General Manager, Loretta Burnett, stated: "There will be additional costs associated with a plan change but they are modest in comparison."<ref>Reed, Kim. "Reserve zone change on the books," ''North Shore Times'', Sep 29, 2005, p. 3.</ref> However, subsequent further delays have lifted the cost to the region of $9.25 to $9.5 million as of the end of 2007, with a budget shortfall of $2.75 million.<ref>Lotter, Michelle.

===Resource consent issue===
[[Image:FootprintofFirstVersionNewBirkenheadLibrary.jpg|thumb|right|250px|<small>Footprint of the first version of the new library (blue line), in comparison to the old library and Plunkett building.</small>]]
The Council had lodged a resource consent application for the new building in December 2004, but did not wait for it to be confirmed before demolishing the existing building in May-June  the next year.  According to a 2006 examination of the project management, Council assumed there was little risk of the application being declined.<ref>White, Jean. "Report criticises library process," ''North Shore Times'', Mar 16, 2006, p. 3.</ref> However, an amended Council report by planner Ian Jefferis revealed that the building was to occupy 15% more of the reserve than expected (pictured).<ref>Reed, Kim. "Fears that Council breaching own rules," ''North Shore Times'', Jun 30, 2005, p. 1.</ref> Speaking after his appeal in 2007, Bill Abrahams, owner of Rawene Chambers located opposite the library site (pictured below), said that this lack of a consent was "the crux of the matter."<ref>Reed, Kim. "Library hit by more delays," ''North Shore Times'', Mar 27, 2007, p. 2.</ref>

Some residents claimed they had not been properly consulted. Abrahams felt he should've been consulted because the design blocked his views.<ref>Reed, Kim. "Library hit by more delays," ''North Shore Times'', Mar 27, 2007, p. 2.</ref> The Council disputed that there had been no consultation. The Strategic projects manager, Simon Guillemin, pointed out that there had been a number of public meetings and press releases. He also said there had also been consultation with the Birkenhead Town Centre Association and the Friends of the Library.<ref>Reed, Kim. "Fears that Council breaching own rules," ''North Shore Times'', Jun 30, 2005, p. 1.</ref>

Yet in June, independent commissioners declined [[resource consent]]. Reasons cited included concern about the impact on the existing environment, traffic flow, and the building's proposed size, which violated the zoning requirements.<ref>Reed, Kim.

As part of their later application on rezoning the Council submitted a report on the prevailing winds, which suggested the land would be unsuitable as open space.<ref>"Wind Assessment of Nell Fisher Reserve, Birkenhead."

Three-quarters of those who made submissions on the rezoning supported the change, including [[Robert Muldoon#Thea Muldoon|Thea Muldoon]].

Milne, who had made proposals as far back as 1989, proffered a wide variety of alternative plans for a far more elaborate community centre.  These involved road closures, adding new roads, and leasing or selling his land on 15 and 17 Rawene Road, or going into partnership using his buildings.  There was, however, little support for his ideas.<ref>Willis, Liz. "Library objector presents own plan," ''North Shore Times'', Oct 4, 2005, p. 2</ref><ref>Lynch, Haley. "Library debate hots up," ''North Shore Times'', Oct 11, 2005, p. 2</ref> In October 2005 he sent an email to Community Services & Parks Committee claiming his proposals had been misrepresented.  He accused those doing the assessment reports of "yet more incompetence" and threatened to contest the rezoning "fiercely.. every step of the way."

[[Image:RezoningBirkenheadLibrarysite.jpg|thumb|right|300px| <small>Zoning at the library site, before and after the commissioners' decision.</small>]]
In June 2006 the three independent commissioners approved the rezoning of the district plan (pictured).<ref>North Shore City Council, [http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/your_council/news_releases/Releases-2006/June/Library-to-be-built-on-Nell-Fisher-Reserve.htm "Library to be built on Nell Fisher reserve"], Jun 1, 2006.</ref><ref>"Birkenhead Library gets rezoning nod," ''The Aucklander'', Jun 7, 2006, p. 7.</ref> Their decision acknowledged the significance of historical precedent. In other words, the fact that there had been a library on the site for over thirty years was "notable" with regards to the usage the land was now put to. Also important was the appropriateness of the site in comparison to other options. Previous reports in 2003 and 2005 had considered the existing site was the best choice; while the Highbury Centre Plan of 2006 indicated that there had been extensive close consultation with the community over two years, which in a general sense was pertinent to the usage of the contested land. The commissioners concurred, and the library site became formalised as part of a Special Purpose 9 zone, which allows for the continued operation of community facilities. They noted too, that it is this zoning which underlies other North Shore Libraries, such as the ones at Takapuna and Glenfield.<ref>North Shore City Council. ''North Shore City district plan (operative in part) decisions on submissions and further submissions in respect of plan change 14 : re-zone Nell Fisher Reserve, Birkenhead''. Takapuna: North Shore, 2006.</ref>

The commissioners also reconfigured the Recreation 2 boundary, to cut through the middle plot. This was done to safeguard the treed area, and to ensure a  better balance between the reserve and the building complex. They emphasised the need for integration, both physical and visual, between the two zones to encourage usage of the recreation area.

It was expected then that the library project would be further delayed by two years.<ref>Watson, Ben.

</ref> However, Abraham Holdings, owner of the Rawene Chambers, located opposite the library's former site (pictured), lodged a last-minute appeal with the [[Environment Court]], claiming, among other things, concern over the impact on the historic value of the reserve.

After three months deliberation the Environment Court approved the building of a new library on the old site, but reaffirmed the rezoning commissioners' restrictions, notably the restriction on height which dropped the maximum from 11 m to 9 m, and the constraints on the footprint (pictured). The Council agreed, "keen to keep the planning process as straight-forward as possible." Bill Abraham, of Abraham Holdings, claimed "people in years to come will be grateful for all the park space that has been kept."<ref>Reed, Kim.

While the exact future of Birkenhead Library is uncertain a survey conducted by the [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for Northcote [[Jonathan Coleman (politician)|Jonathan Coleman]] in October 2006 showed there was still widespread public support for the return of the library to its old site.<ref>Willis, Liz.

==Staff structure==
In the beginning volunteers were crucial to the running of the library. Savings in wages were considered instrumental in allowing the purchase of more books and also allowed money to be set aside for future planned extensions to the building.<ref>"Birkenhead library: progress with new venture," ''North Shore Times'', Sep 14, 1940, p. 5.</ref><ref>"Birkenhead Public Library: annual report," ''North Shore Times'', Jun 13, 1951, p. 5.</ref> In 1949 the number of volunteers was recorded at twenty-eight. They included the town clerk and a councilor, Percy Hurn, as well others who had given freely of their expertise such as Duthie from the Auckland Public library,<ref>"Birkenhead library: opening ceremony," ''North Shore Times'', Nov 30, 1949, p. 3.</ref> a passing instructor from the Country Library service,<ref>"Birkenhead library," ''North Shore Times'', Oct 26, 1949, p. 7.</ref> and those pulled in to read to the kids during the school holidays.<ref>Christie, Colleen. (1988). ''Back then: oral history interviews from the Birkenhead Public Library collection'', Birkenhead: Birkenhead City Council, vol. 1, p. 49 & vol. 2, p. 49.</ref> Among this "band of honorary assistants" a Mrs Gaidener, Mr Slovey and Mr Odd came in for particular acknowledgement.<ref>quote from "Birkenhead Public Library: annual report," ''North Shore Times'', Jun 13, 1951, p. 5.</ref><ref>"Birkenhead library: interesting statistics," ''North Shore Times'', Oct 11, 1950, p. 3.</ref> At the opening of the new library building nearly twenty years later the mayor paid tribute to all the original volunteers.<ref>"New page in Birkenhead history," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Apr 26, 1968, p. 6.</ref>

By 1950 the Borough Council was looking to formally employ someone for <U+00A3>100 a year. Joan Foggin and John Wilson were the first paid staff,<ref>Fisher, Muriel and Hilder, Wenman. (1969). ''Birkenhead: the kauri suburb'', Birkenhead: Birkenhead Borough Council, p. 102.</ref> while Eleanor Fisher, already working in the library became the first full-time staff member in 1952. She remained the in-charge librarian until her retirement nineteen years later.<ref>"Joined library for three months - stayed two decades," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Feb 23, 1971, p. 12.</ref> By 1955 there was a part-time library assistant as well;<ref>"Library report records issue of 35,000 books," ''North Shore Times'', Nov 23, 1955, p. 2.</ref> and soon a fulltime junior was being considered.<ref>"Birkenhead public library report," ''North Shore Advertiser'', May 27, 1959, p. 3.</ref> Growth in library use and opening hours continued,<ref>"Birkenhead Public Library," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Apr 26, 1968, p. 6.</ref><ref>North Shore Libraries. ''Annual Reports: 1990-1992 & 1998/1999'', Takapuna, North Shore City Council.</ref> so that by 1968 there were 3 fulltimers and a part-timer to help on Friday nights.<ref>"Birkenhead Librarian's reports to Borough Council, ''North Shore Times'', Apr 26, 1961, p. 7.</ref><ref>"New page in Birkenhead history," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Apr 26, 1968, p. 5.</ref>
Staffing peaked in 1986 with 11.5 [[full time equivalent]]s, and was subsequently reduced to 8.67.<ref>Graham, Rata. Birkenhead library: a history, Birkenhead: North Shore Libraries, p. 8.</ref> This includes staff spread over seven days, and reflects the high preponderance of part-timers typical of the industry. The decrease in staff occurred despite the onset of Sunday openings and the increase in door-count and issues because, at least in part, amalgamation allowed the centralisation of many departments, such as cataloguing.<ref>Graham, Rata. Birkenhead library: a history, Birkenhead: North Shore Libraries, p. 5.</ref> The onset of computers has also increased efficiency, even to the near complete automation of some services, such as circulation through self-issue machines, which recorded 40% of items borrowed within their first months of installation at Birkenhead in 1995.<ref>North Shore Libraries. ''Annual report 1995/1996'', Takapuna, North Shore City Council.</ref>

The current staff structure is headed by a Community Librarian, with two main senior positions: an Information Services Librarian and a Children and Young Adults Librarian, both of which are full-time positions. Other senior roles include the Weekend Supervisors. The main bulk of staff continues to be Library Assistants, with 1-2 being fulltime. There are also a number of shelvers, generally students.<ref>North Shore Libraries. ''Annual reports: 1990-2000'', Takapuna, North Shore City Council.</ref> Other occasional staff have included a librarian on exchange from England,<ref>"Trip of a lifetime," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Feb 16, 1989, p. 9.</ref> and various volunteers, such as a Taskforce Green worker helping with a rebarcoding project,<ref>North Shore Libraries. ''Annual reports: 1990-2000'', Takapuna, North Shore City Council.</ref> and a student doing a Duke of Edinburgh award.<ref>"Library celebrates," North Shore Times Advertiser, Sep 7, 1988, p. 27.</ref>

==Services==
Services include children's programmes, reference, interloans, internet access, printer-copier, and housebound deliveries.

===Children's programmes===
[[Image:BirkenheadLibrary RaakauReadingTree.jpg|thumb|right|250px|<small>Raakau Reading Tree</small>]]
Children's programmes were in place from early on. Eleanor Fisher persuaded local residents to come in and read to kids during school holidays. Storytime went for an hour once a week, and up to 50 kids attended.<ref>Christie, Colleen. (1988). ''Back then: oral history interviews from the Birkenhead Public Library collection'', Birkenhead: Birkenhead City Council, vol 1, p. 105.</ref> Class visits by local schools started in 1954, and became a regular feature.<ref>"Birkenhead Public Library: annual report on progress," ''North Shore Times'', Jul 21, 1954, p. 1.</ref><ref>"Library story hour in January," ''North Shore Advertiser'', Dec 21, 1960, p. 4.</ref> Outside of this collaboration with schools the library offered reading programmes, such as "Go Bush" and later, as part of the North Shore Libraries, the Rakaau Reader scheme. This encouraged reading by setting targets coupled with incentives and visible marks of achievement, such as green, silver, then gold leaves on the Raakau tree (pictured).<ref>"Learning the love of books," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Feb 2, 1999, p. 5.</ref><ref>[http://www.shorelibraries.govt.nz/Kids/Rakau/ Raakau], North Shore Libraries. Accessed Dec 20, 2007.</ref>

From this the library became more involved in the provision of a wider range of holiday activities, like puppet shows and hands-on arts and crafts, such as making hats or murals or cake decorations. On one occasion these were so well subscribed the library held them down the road in the All Saints Church hall.<ref>"Birkenhead Children's Librarian retires," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Nov 25, 1980, p. 29.</ref> There were events too on such occasions as the library's 50th celebration, and Halloween.<ref>"Events mark library's 50th anniversary," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Feb 2, 1999, p. 9.</ref><ref>"Goosebumps party haunting experience," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', May 22, 1997, p. 2.</ref>

There have been regular appearances by authors, illustrators, storytellers and various speakers, and celebrities from Judy Bailey to Edith the Elf. Others include storyteller Lynne Kriegler, illustrators Trevor Pye, Margaret Beames, Robyn Belton, and Judy Lambert, and writers Lino Nelisi, Tom Bradley, and Jean Bennett, as well as Irish storyteller Nigel De Burca, and two of the Aunties.<ref>North Shore Libraries. ''Annual reports: 1990-2000'', Takapuna, North Shore City Council.</ref> They were often invited as part of various book festivals, such as the Children's Aim Book Award.<ref>"Kids take part in book festival," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Apr 18 1995 p. 11.</ref> Competitions to select favourite reads further raised awareness and use of the books.<ref>"Party and competition for children," ''3 Bs Bulletin'', Apr 11, 1996, p. 5.</ref>

Lapsit for preschoolers with their parents was an innovation launched by then Chief Librarian Rata Graham in 1992. These were half-hour sessions of mostly music and song, as well as stories and finger puppetry.<ref>Graham, Rata. (1992). ''Birkenhead library: a history'', Birkenhead: North Shore Libraries, p. 7.</ref> Lapsit proved so popular it was extended to twice a week in 1999.<ref>North Shore Libraries. ''Annual Review: 1999/2000'', Takapuna, North Shore City Council.</ref> It was the precursor to "Rhymetime" now standardised across the entire North Shore Libraries system, a programme specifically designed to encourage active socialisation and the development of reading skills, through the focus on rhythm and rhyme.<ref>[http://www.shorelibraries.govt.nz/Kids/Lapsit.php Rhymetime], North Shore Libraries.

Currently Adult, Young Adults, Junior, and Large Print collections are subdivided in the traditional manner, into fiction and nonfiction areas with the latter arranged according to the [[Dewey decimal system]]. Media other than books are generally collated as separate collections or subdivisions. There are exceptions, such as language material which is collated in the nonfiction 400s. Junior material is separated into the widest range of categories, from board books up through various reading-ages, such as picture books, readers, and various levels of chapter books.<ref>[http://www.elgar.govt.nz/search~S6/ Catalogue], North Shore Libraries.

==Public space==
[[Image:BirkenheadLibraryChildrensSpace.jpg|thumb|250px|right|<small>Public space in the Children's section of the current Birkenhead Library in the Leisure Centre.</small>]]
The library has also tried to provide public space for various activities, such as study and leisure reading, though its history is marked by a struggle to do this consistently. The lack of space meant the popularity of the original library was something of an embarrassment.<ref>"Birkenhead library," ''North Shore Times'', Sep 12, 1951, p. 5.</ref> The 1968 building was more spacious, especially after later alterations. 1973 saw the addition of the mezzanine floor;<ref>White & White Ltd. North Shore City Council ''Birkenhead building feasibility study''. Tauranga: White & White Ltd, 2000, p. 4.</ref> and 1993, the addition of a Young Adult room, as well as a Large Print lounge.<ref>"More space for library at Birkenhead," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Nov 11, 1993, p. 36.</ref> However, there was little room for much expansion, which led to the curtailment of some service development.<ref>Graham, Rata. (1992). ''Birkenhead Library: A history'', Birkenhead: North Shore Libraries, p. 9.</ref> This was one of the reasons for the new building project started in 2005.<ref>"Birkenhead Library gets $1m expansion," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Aug 23, 2001, p. 11.</ref> The current temporary location in the Leisure Centre, offers two tables in the magazine-newspaper-computer area, along with a few sofa chairs. The Children's section also has some seating (pictured).

==Mobile library==
===Origins===
Located in central Highbury the library is about seven miles (11 km) distant from the more remote areas of Beachhaven and Birkdale. As a consequence, from the mid-1960s there was a persistent call to establish a more convenient branch location. Petitioned by residents the Borough Council considered the possibility of setting up something in the Beachhaven hall on a temporary basis, to see if it would take. They asked the then Chief Librarian Ann Clegg to prepare a report looking into the details.<ref>"Library," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Nov 29, 1977, p. 5.</ref>

Her conclusion that a branch was an expensive option, and that it would made more sense to expand the existing library aggrieved locals. They felt her assertion that there was not enough demand by "serious readers" was a misrepresentation of the community's ability and very real need; while the three councillors who'd campaigned on a promise of getting something done, proclaimed the report biased. The Beachhaven Residents and Ratepayers Association started a petition and gathered 700 signatures. There were angry letters in the paper.<ref>"Storm over library," ''North Shore Times Adverstiser'', Apr 11, 1978, p. 7.</ref><ref>[Letters to the editor], ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Apr 20, 1978, p. 14.</ref>

In the event Birkenhead bought the mobile van off Takapuna in 1982.<ref>"Birkenhead Borough Council has purchased TCC mobile van," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', May 13, 1983, p. 5.</ref> This was a 1949 Bedford chassis with a purpose-built body that had already been in service for 35 years, much of it as the first mobile library in Auckland.<ref>"Van features in window display," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Aug 6, 1985, p. 7.</ref> In fact, as part of the Takapuna City Council in 1977 it had been contracted to visit the outer Birkenhead area once a week. This was reminiscent of the Country Library van, a national service which used to visit Birkenhead Library itself several times a year during an earlier era.<ref>"Birkenhead Public Library: annual report," ''North Shore Times'', Jun 13, 1951, p. 5.</ref>

===Years of service===
With its purchase Birkenhead greatly expanded the mobile service. Capable of stocking up to 2000 items the van now went out five days a week with a full range of items from adult fiction, to magazines, picture books and puzzles, constantly reinvigorated from the main library. As well, it provided a community noticeboard. The van stopped at a different place each day, generally staying between 10am and 4:30pm, closing only for lunch and tea-breaks.<ref>"Library help for Birkenhead people," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', May 13, 1982, p. 5.</ref> This was a length of time commensurate with weekend services. Within a few years though the more common practice was adopted of spending less time at a greater variety of locations.<ref>"Van features in window display," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Aug 6, 1985, p. 7.</ref>

Initially there were two staff to cope with the influx of registrations, but the sole position was quickly established with Cynthia McKenzie as Birkenhead's first Mobile Librarian.<ref>[Mobile], ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Jun 10, 1982, p. 3.</ref> Over its decade of existence the Mobile had half a dozen different librarians, who had to cope with double de-clutching, a leaking roof and stifling heat, as well as the usual duties of a librarian.<ref>"Sharron Cleghorn loves her library," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Sep 5, 1987, p. 1.</ref><ref>"Cooling system in mobile makes library uncomfortable," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', May 10, 1988, p. 11.</ref>

===Retirement===
Issues dropped,<ref>"Mobile library use drops," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Jun 18, 1986, p. 8.</ref> and in 1988 the service was reduced from 5 to 2 days a week,<ref>"Mobile library service halved," ''Shore News'', Jul 10, 1991, p. 1.</ref> in part perhaps due to increasing mechanical difficulties. The once famously reliable van had problems with its radiator ensuring it had to be constantly stopped and attended by the last Mobile Librarian, Malcolm Fletcher. Then it blew a head gasket.<ref>"Bookworms bemoan van's passing," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Jul 16, 1991, p. 3.</ref> With the onset of amalgamation of Birkenhead into the wider North Shore Libraries it was superseded by the system Mobile anyway, and the Bedford was eventually retired in 1992. Not wanted by [[Motat]] or the Devenport Museum it eventually went to the North Shore Vintage Car Club.<ref>"Wheels move slowly on mobile van," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Sep 7, 1991, p. 3.</ref> Over its eleven years of operation it had issued over 163 thousand items.<ref>North Shore Libraries. ''Annual report: 1990/1991'', Takapuna, North Shore City Council.</ref>

==Webpage development==
The North Shore Libraries catalogue was launched onto the [[History of the internet|Internet]] in June 1995.<ref>North Shore Libraries. ''Annual report 1995/1996'', Takapuna, North Shore City Council.</ref> Shortly afterwards the branches began to demonstrate general internet usage to the public, then to rollout access.<ref>"Surfing in the library," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Jun 21, 1996, p. ?.</ref><ref>"Library surfs the internet," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Sep 19, 1996, p. 38.</ref><ref>"Libraries internet access," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Jun 12, 1997.</ref> By May 1996 Birkenhead was having daily demonstrations.<ref>North Shore Libraries.

[[Image:Bkh-library-webpage-c1999.jpg|right|thumb|250px|<small>The Birkenhead Library webpage c1999. Patterned [[Computer wallpaper|wallpaper]] was a common background feature used on early websites.</small>]]
Birkenhead Library's own subsidiary webpage was already well established then, before its subsequent recording on the Internet Archive (pictured).<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20001217000300/www.shorelibraries.govt.nz/birkenhead.htm North Shore Libraries: Birkenhead (last updated July 2000)], Internet Archive, Mar 30, 2001.</ref> It was sited two clicks in from the main page. There was a photo, and the predominant green of the layout matched the official Council colour used in its logo. From this static front a number of subpages could be accessed. These detailed basic facts about the library, such as location, opening hours, and staff contact details. This was to remain unchanged for about five years, apart from minor alterations, such as the inclusion of a branch phone number prominently displayed on the frontpage, and updates to reflect changes in staffing.

===White with columns 2003-2008===
[[Image:Bkh-library-webpage-c2003.jpg|thumb|right|250px|<small>Birkenhead Library webpage c2003. Note the attempt to portray the branch's indivdual identity, while also incorporating it into the overall North Shore Library design.</small>]]
In 2003 a more elaborate three-column style was adopted (pictured).<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20030822052635/www.shorelibraries.govt.nz/Locations/Birkenhead/ North Shore Libraries: Birkenhead (undated)], Internet Archive, Oct 7, 2003.</ref> This marked a shift from Datacom's maintenance to the work of Mike Copley and Trine Romlund hired specifically to build a more functional and professional-looking website for the entire North Shore Libraries. They used [[PHP]] templates.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20030811073049/www.shorelibraries.govt.nz/credits.php North Shore Libraries: Credits (undated)], Internet Archives, Oct 7, 2003. PHP mentioned in pagesource.</ref> Features included a range of photo thumbs illustrating aspects of the library and its services, and a brief note on the history of the library. Three significantly detailed related pages were also added: Birkenhead Local History Books for Sale, Birkenhead Library Collections and Services, and its subpage on the Chelsea Archives.

This remained the style and predominant content of the Birkenhead Library webpage into 2008.<ref>[http://www.shorelibraries.govt.nz/Locations/Birkenhead/ Birkenhead Library webpage (current)], North Shore Libraries. This is the current page link, so may not remain relevant to footnote for long.

The Internet Archive records generally becomes available after six months. </ref> Only some minor details changed, such as the link from the North Shore Libraries main page reduced from three to two clicks with the utilisation of drop-down menus; and an increased cross-linking of hyperlinks throughout the North Shore Libraries website.

===Current display===
The Birkenhead webpage was not updated to reflect the library's shift in location to the Leisure Centre until October 2005, despite the fact that the previous building was demolished in May.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20050924155124/www.shorelibraries.govt.nz/Locations/Birkenhead/ North Shore Libraries: Birkenhead (undated)], Internet Archive, Oct 25, 2005.</ref> This was indicative of the contrast between the branch pages and the North Shore Libraries website as a whole. The former remained more or less as static markers; while the presentation of the latter became increasingly dynamic. In this interim period, for examples, there had also been a shift to an entirely new computer system and a national election. Coverage of both of these events was restricted to the main North Shore Libraries website.<ref> [http://web.archive.org/web/20050630011851/http://www.shorelibraries.govt.nz/ North Shore Libraries: Our smart new catalogue (undated)], Internet Archive, Jun 30, 2005.</ref><ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20050822123710/http://www.shorelibraries.govt.nz/ North Shore Libraries: Election 05 (undated)], Internet Archive, Aug 22, 2005.</ref> Similarly, localised versions of system-wide activitites, such as children's lapsits and author visits, have been collated into the main Kids and Events sections. Recently the occasional newsletter about the ongoing development of the new library has been displayed on Birkenhead Library's frontpage.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070429212824/www.shorelibraries.govt.nz/Locations/Birkenhead/ North Shore Libraries: Birkenhead Library and Civic Centre update April 2007], Internet Archive, Jun 8, 2007.</ref> However, these have not had unique [[url]]s; and are replaced as they are updated, rather than archived.

==Artwork and exhibitions==
The library has purchased or had donated a variety of artworks:

*Two bound folios of [[Charles Goldie]] prints and watercolour prints of [[Charles Heaphy]]. Donated in 1981 and 1983 respectively by Bob & Norma Inward, valued at $750 each.<ref>"Gift of Charles Heaphy's work to Birkenhead library," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Jun 2, 1983, p. 1.</ref>
*Bush walk painting. Presented by the Birkenhead Licencing Trust, valued at $1500. Also "some pottery" and a leatherbound album of the 1988 Birkenhead centenary.<ref>"Farwell to the council, and 'xmas' for library," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Oct 5, 1989, p. 9.</ref>
*"Sands of Time in Piha," painting by Michelle Stuart. Donated by Birkenhead Licensing Trust.<ref>"More space for library at Birkenhead," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Nov 11, 1993, p. 36.</ref>

Done by students from Birkenhead College.<ref>"Pupils help to brighten library," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Jul 4, 1989, p. 31.</ref>

There have also been a number of exhibitions, often work of local artists. These were usually presented on the mezzanine floor of the Civic Reserve library. The first exhibition was a display of books in 1955. Subjects ranged from "poetry to sheep mustering," and included works by William Satchell and [[Katherine Mansfield]]. The oldest item was a bible in [[Maori]] published in 1840.<ref>"88 books covering 100 years of publishing," ''North Shore Times'', Sep 29, 1955, p. 5.</ref> During the North Shore Arts Festival of 1966 there was an exhibition devoted exclusively to Maori books, sculpture and painting.<ref>"Maori poet to read at Birkenhead," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Dec 22, 1966, p. 3.</ref>

Other exhibitions include paintings by Pauline Thompson, Linda Mcneur-Wismer, Betty Eddington, and Susan Durrant, pottery by Peter Collis and Peter Shearer, prints by Julienne Francis, glass sculptures by Carl Houser, and copperwork by Andrew Campbell. A fabric art collection by locals was instigated by Rata Graham and displayed as part of the library's centenary celebrations.<ref>North Shore Libraries.

==Support groups==
Birkenhead library has had a number of support groups. Volunteers were instrumental in staffing the library in the early days;<ref>"Mayor lauds library's many helpers," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Nov 9 1967, p. 3.</ref> while the Birkenhead [[Rotary Club]] took down the old council quarters in preparation for the new 1968 building.<ref>Fisher, Muriel and Hilder, Wenman. (1969). Birkenhead: the kauri suburb, Birkenhead: Birkenhead Borough Council, p. 101.</ref> They also donated money to set up the Reference Collection; and later, in 1982, they started the first collection of talking books.<ref>"Birkenhead Rotary Club completed project..," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Jul 1, 1969, p. 16.</ref><ref>"Collection established," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Jun 29, 1982, p. 4.</ref> Similarly, the Plunkett club of 1980 raised $200 to buy 35 [[LP album|LP]] recordings of children's fairytales, songs and rhymes.<ref>"Fairytales on record," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Mar 13, 1980, p. 2.</ref>

The [[Friends of Libraries|Friends]] of Birkenhead Library were established in November 1990, under the patronage of [[Keith Sinclair]], and continued under [[Thea Muldoon]] from 1994.<ref>North Shore Libraries. ''Annual report: 1990/1991'', Takapuna, North Shore City Council.</ref><ref>North Shore Libraries. ''Annual report: 1993/1994'', Takapuna, North Shore City Council.</ref> They have advocated strongly for the library, most recently on behalf of the new building, drumming up support through meetings with the Community Board and in the local paper.<ref>"Pressure goes on library plans," ''North Shore Times'', Mar 11, 2004 p. 5.</ref><ref>Wright, Adrienne (Chairwoman, Friends of Birkenhead Library). "Letter to editor: Friendly words," ''North Shore Times'', Mar 23, 2006, p. 7.</ref> Along with Plunkett they spoke up for the library at the Environment Court hearing.<ref>Reed, Kim. "Library hit by more delays," ''North Shore Times'', Mar 27, 2007, p. 2.</ref> The Friends have also raised monies for various equipment, such as listening posts and the library's first camera, a [[Pentax]].<ref>North Shore Libraries. ''Annual report: 1994/1995'', Takapuna, North Shore City Council.</ref> Speakers at their events have been diverse and have included historian [[Claudia Orange]], writers Muriel Fisher, Sheridan Keith, and Rosemary Menzies, as well as [[Ann Hartley]], a former mayor, Jenny Kirk, a former councillor, and Sergio Gulyaev, a Russian astronomer.<ref>North Shore Libraries. ''Annual reports: 1990-2000'', Takapuna, North Shore City Council.</ref>

==Usage statistics==
Published statistics extend to 2000, with most detail being recorded for the 1990s when Annual Reports were written for each branch. These statistics give an indication of usage of the library by a variety of measures including membership, issues (yearly and monthly), door count, stock size and number of reference queries.<ref>North Shore Libraries. ''Annual reports: 1990-2000'', Takapuna, North Shore City Council. Note, when a figure for a year is cited this refers to a financial year "as at 31 March or 30 June." (See Annual Report 1990/1991). Monthly figures were also collated into semesters (4 month periods), then quarters (3 month periods).</ref>

===Membership===
No statistical correlation has been done with population growth, though the latter has been cited generally in connection with library usage. Also there has been some records of membership numbers in and of themselves, as well as a proportion of the total population. So, for example, in 1971 there were 8,752 members of a borough population of 15,825. That this meant over half the population were members was duly noted.<ref>"Library in demand," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Jun 15, 1971, p. 22.</ref> However, by 1992 the population had increased to 31,860, while membership had only risen to 13,162.<ref>Graham, Rata. (1992). ''Birkenhead Library: A history'', Birkenhead: North Shore Libraries, p. 8.</ref> By 2003 there were 150 new registrations a month.<ref>"Library list of woes make sad reading," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Jun 10, 2003, p. 1.</ref>
[[Image:AnnualIssuesBirkenheadLibrary.jpg|thumb|right|350px|<small>Annual issues at Birkenhead Library 1950-2000.</small>]]
===Issues===
From the library's inception issues have risen steadily with minor fluctuations, from a little over 8,000 items in 1950 to over 300,000 at the turn of the century (pictured). To date the peak recorded year of the published data has been 1998. In 1957 when issues dropped for the first time, this was attributed to the opening of the Northcote Library.<ref>"Decline in library book issues," ''North Shore Times'', Nov 21, 1956, p. 1.</ref> Similarly, while the Civic Reserve building was being constructed the library was relocated to a temporary shop site and the subsequent fall off in 1968 was attributed to this.<ref>"Fewer books issued at Birkenhead," ''North Shore Times Advertiser'', Feb 22, 1968, p. 8.</ref> Other trends visible from the graph include a dip in the 1970s and a rise in the 1990s. Data on the impact of the shift to the Leisure Centre has not been made publicly available yet.

Over its decade of existence the Birkenhead Mobile Library issued nearly 15,000 items a year. At one point, 1984, 24,128 items, equivalent to more than 10% of the building's issue; though on average about half that. On the other hand, Birkenhead as a subset of the whole North Shore Libraries system, has averaged 16% of the total issues.<ref>Figures derived from tables in North Shore Libraries. ''Annual reports: 1990-2000'', Takapuna, North Shore City Council.</ref> This figure excludes those early years when there were no other libraries on the North Shore, but includes the introduction of branches at Takapuna, Northcote, Devonport, East Coast Bays, Glenfield, and the system Mobile, as well as the start and cessation of Birkenhead's Mobile, the impact of amalgamation, and the shift to and from various buildings.
