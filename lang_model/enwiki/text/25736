== Writing and production ==
Lopez and her fellow writer [[Cory Rooney]] who she works closely with came up with the song "Cari<U+00F1>o" during early studio recording sessions for ''J.Lo''. However, it took "forever" to develop, according to Lopez who stated: "I couldn't write it, Cory couldn't write it. We had other people try to write it. No one could write this damn song".<ref name="feat" /> Eventually, multiple people were brought in to contribute to the song's lyrics, including Manny Benito, Neal Creque, Jose Sanchez, Frank Rodriguez and Guillermo Edghill, Jr.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jennifer Lopez <U+2013> Cari<U+00F1>o|url=http://www.spanishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Jennifer+Lopez&titel=Cari%F1o&cat=s|publisher=[[Spanish Record Charts{{!}}Spanish Music Charts]].
