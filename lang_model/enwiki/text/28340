'''Jason Randolph Scheff''' (born April 16, 1962 in [[San Diego, California]]) is an American [[bassist]], singer and songwriter. Since 1985 he has been the bassist and singer for the veteran [[pop music|pop]]-[[rock music|rock]] band [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3885/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Chicago|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|publisher=[[All Media Guide|AMG]]|accessdate=17 May 2010}}</ref> He is the oldest son of well-known session bassist [[Jerry Scheff]], who toured for several years with [[Elvis Presley]]. His brothers Darin and Lauren Scheff are also professional songwriters.

Scheff was a member of the Class of 1980 at San Diego's [[Point Loma High School]] and started his professional musical career in 1982 as a member of a Los Angeles based rock band named Keane (not to be confused with the British band of the same name).

At age 23, Jason joined Chicago in mid-1985 when [[Peter Cetera]] left to pursue a solo career. His ability to closely duplicate Cetera's vocal parts on Chicago hits allowed the band to continue its touring/recording efforts without a hitch; he debuted on lead vocals on their 1986 single "[[25 or 6 to 4]]," a new version of their 1970 hit, and then followed up with lead vocals on the hit single "[[Will You Still Love Me? (Chicago song)|Will You Still Love Me?]]" Besides performing the band's classic material, Scheff has composed several original songs for the band, including their 1989 Top 10 single "[[What Kind Of Man Would I Be?]]." Scheff also cowrote the song "Heart Of Mine" with [[Bobby Caldwell]] and Dennis Matkosky. The song became a big hit for [[Boz Scaggs]] in 1988. It was included in the 1988 Boz Scaggs album "[[Other Roads]]" and the collection [[Hits! (Boz Scaggs album)|Hits!]]. In 2005, Scheff and Chicago founding member [[Robert Lamm]] convinced the band to record ''[[Chicago XXX]]'', their first collection of new material since 1991's ''[[Twenty 1]]''. Scheff also enlisted [[Rascal Flatts]] vocalist/bassist [[Jay DeMarcus]] to serve as producer for the new album, which was released on March 21, 2006. Scheff co-wrote seven of the 12 songs on the CD.

Scheff, along with co-writers [[Peter Wolf]] and [[Ina Wolf]], wrote a song in the early 1990s called "[[Bigger Than Elvis]]," for what was intended to be Chicago's 22nd album. This song is about Jason Scheff's father, [[Jerry Scheff]], and describes Jason's memories growing up watching his father play for [[Elvis Presley]] on TV (although he also played with [[Elvis Costello]]), and thinking that his father was the big star. "Elvis was just a guy in a suit," Jason said during the 2003 concert on [[A&E Network|A&E]]'s Live by Request. The album however, was rejected by [[Warner Brothers]] in 1993, and sat unreleased until 2008 when Rhino released it as ''[[Chicago XXXII: Stone of Sisyphus]]''.

Scheff has also enjoyed some limited success as a solo artist, releasing a CD entitled ''[[Chauncy (album)|Chauncy]]'' in 1996, as well as several duets released only in [[Japan]].

In 2005, Scheff (credited as Jason Chefe),<ref name=Discogs>{{cite news |url= http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jason+Scheff?anv=Jason+Chefe&filter_anv=1 | work=Discogs | title=Jason Scheff Discography|accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref> appeared on the [[Pink Floyd]] tribute album ''[[Back Against the Wall]]'', performing lead vocals and bass on the track "[[Run Like Hell]]", together with [[Dweezil Zappa]] (lead guitar), [[Tony Kaye (musician)|Tony Kaye]] (keyboard solo), [[Aynsley Dunbar]] (drums), [[Bob Kulick]] (electric guitar), [[Billy Sherwood]] (keyboards).

In late 2006, Scheff joined indie supergroup [[L.E.O.]] to create the album ''[[Alpacas Orgling]]'', a tribute to [[Jeff Lynne]] and the [[Electric Light Orchestra]]. ''Alpacas Orgling'' was released in October 2006, to generally positive reviews.

As of November 2007, Scheff began broadcasting his vocals and music work over the internet via [http://www.ustream.tv/channel/scheffy-show Ustream.tv.]

In 2009 Jason, along with founding member of Chicago [[Robert Lamm]] were the executive producer's of [[Zosia Karbowiak]] Solo CD "S.I.N.G."
