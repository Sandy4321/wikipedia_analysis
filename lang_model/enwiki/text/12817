'''Brian Charles Lara''' (born [[May 2]], [[1969]]) ([[List of nicknames used in cricket|nicknamed]] "The Prince of Port-of-Spain" or simply "The Prince") is a record-breaking [[West Indian cricket team|West Indian]] [[cricketer]] who is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen ever. Lara is the current captain of the West Indies team, has several times topped the [[Test cricket|Test]] batting [[LG ICC cricket ratings|rankings]] and as of December 2006 holds two of the most prestigious World Records for batting in Tests: [[List of Test cricket triple centuries|highest individual innings]] and the all-time leading run scorer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Batting/BattingCareerRuns.asp?Stat=5000 |title=Test Batting Statistics}}</ref> He also holds the record for the highest individual score in first class cricket.

==Early life==

Lara was born in [[Cantaro]], [[Santa Cruz, Trinidad and Tobago|Santa Cruz]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], the 10th of 11 children.

Lara's father Bunty and one of his older sisters Agnes Cyrus enrolled him in the local Harvard Coaching Clinic at the age of six for weekly coaching sessions on Sundays. As a result, Lara had a very early education in correct batting technique.

Lara's first school was St. Joseph's Roman Catholic primary. He then went to San Juan secondary, but played no cricket there. A year later, at fourteen years old, he moved on to Fatima College. Lara moved in with his future fellow Trinidadian Test player [[Michael Carew]] in Woodbrook, [[Port of Spain]] (a 20 minute drive from Santa Cruz). Michael's father [[Joey Carew]] worked with him on his cricketing and personal career development. Michael got Lara his first job at [[House of Angostura|Angostura Ltd.]] in the marketing department. Lara played in Trinidad and Tobago junior soccer and table tennis sides but Lara believed that cricket was his path to success, saying{{Fact|date=February 2007}} that he wanted to emulate his idols [[Gordon Greenidge]], [[Viv Richards]] and [[Roy Fredericks]].

Lara began his cricket career while at school at Fatima College. Aged 14, he amassed 745 runs in the schoolboys' league, with an average of 126.16 per innings, which earned him selection for the Trinidad national under-16 team. 

When he was 15 years old, he played in his first West Indian under 19 youth tournament and that same year, Lara represented West Indies in Under-19 cricket.

==Early cricket career==
1987 was a breakthrough year for Lara, when he broke the West Indies youth batting record{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. 

In January, [[1988]], Lara made his first-class debut for [[Trinidad and Tobago cricket team|Trinidad and Tobago]] in the [[Red Stripe Cup]] against [[Barbadian cricket team|Barbados]]. The Bajan attack contained [[Joel Garner]] and [[Malcolm Marshall]], two recent "greats" of West Indies teams. Lara made 92. 

Later in the same year, he captained the West Indies team in Australia for the Bicentennial Youth World Cup and later that year, his innings of 182 as captain of the West Indies under 23 XI against the touring Indian team elevated his reputation even further.

His first selection for the full West Indies team followed in due course, but unfortunately coincided with the death of his father and Lara withdrew from the team. In 1989, he captained a West Indies B Team in Zimbabwe and scored 145. 

In 1990, at the age of 20, Lara became Trinidad and Tobago's youngest ever captain, leading them that season to victory in the one-day Geddes Grant Shield. It was also in 1990 that he made his belated Test debut for West Indies against Pakistan, scoring 44 and 6.

==Career==
Lara holds several world records for high scoring. He has the highest individual score in both [[first-class cricket]] (501 [[not out]] for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]] in 1994) and Test cricket (400 not out for the West Indies against [[English cricket team|England]] in 2004). He also holds the record for the highest total number of runs in a Test career, after overtaking [[Allan Border]] in November 2005. He is the only man to have reclaimed the Test record score, having scored 375 against England in 1994, a record that stood until [[Matthew Hayden]]'s 380 against [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]] in 2003. His 400 not out also made him the second player after [[Donald Bradman|Don Bradman]] to score two Test triple-centuries, and the second after [[Bill Ponsford]] to score two first-class quadruple-centuries. He has scored nine double centuries in Test cricket, second only to Bradman's twelve.

Lara captained the West Indies from [[1997]] to [[1999]]. He was reappointed as captain against the touring [[Australian cricket team|Australians]] in [[2003]], and struck 110 in his first Test match back in charge, showing signs of him returning to his best. In September 2004, West Indies won the ICC Champions Trophy in England under his captaincy. Lester Armogan was an inspiration to him as a youth. He helped shape his career and helped him become a man. The passing of his mentor has devastated him, but he knows "Unlce Les" is watching{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

In March 2005, Lara declined selection for the West Indies team because of a dispute over his personal [[Cable & Wireless (Caribbean)|Cable & Wireless]] sponsorship deal, which clashed with the Cricket Board's main sponsor, [[Digicel]]. Six other players were involved in this dispute, including stars [[Chris Gayle|Christopher Gayle]], [[Ramnaresh Sarwan]], and [[Dwayne Bravo]]. Lara says{{Fact|date=February 2007}} he declined selection in a stand of solidarity, when these players were dropped because of their sponsorship deals. The issue was resolved after the first Test of the series against the touring [[South African cricket team|South African team]]. 

Lara returned to the team for the second Test (and scored a huge first innings score of 196), but in the process lost his captaincy indefinitely to the newly-appointed [[Shivnarine Chanderpaul]]. In the next Test, against the same opponents, he scored a 176 in the first innings. After a one day series against South Africa, he scored his first Test century against the visiting Pakistanis in the first Test at [[Kensington Oval]], [[Bridgetown]], [[Barbados]].

On [[April 26]] [[2006]] Lara was reappointed the captain of the West Indies cricket team for the third time. This followed the resignation of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who had been captain for thirteen months - in which the West Indies won just one of the 14 Test matches they had competed. In May 2006, Lara led the West Indies to successful One-Day series victories against Zimbabwe and India. Lara's team played Australia in the final for the ICC Champions Trophy and lost.

On [[16 December]] [[2006]] he became the first player for the West Indies to pass 10,000 One Day International runs.<ref>{{Citeweb|url=http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Batting/BattingCareerRuns_ODI.asp?Stat=5000 |title= ODI Batting Statistics}}</ref>.  and along with [[Sachin Tendulkar]] one of only two players to do so in both forms of the game.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===Highlights===
[[Image:Brian Lara Graph.png|right|thumb|350px|Brian Lara's career performance graph.]]
*Lara struck 277 runs against [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] in [[Sydney Cricket Ground|Sydney]], his '''maiden Test [[Century (cricket)|century]]''', the fourth highest maiden Test century by any batsman [http://www.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/TESTS/BATTING/HIGHEST_MAIDEN_TONS.html], the highest individual score in all Tests between the two teams and the fourth-highest century ever recorded against Australia by any Test batsman.
*He became the '''first man to score seven centuries in eight [[First-class cricket|first-class]] innings''', the first being the record 375 against [[English cricket team|England]] and the last being the record 501 not out against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]].
*After [[Matthew Hayden]] had eclipsed his '''Test record for highest individual score''' 375 by five runs in [[2003]], he '''reclaimed''' the record scoring 400 not out in [[2004]] against England. With these innings he became the second player to score two Test triple centuries, the second player to score two career quadruple centuries, the only player to achieve both these milestones, and regained the distinction of being the holder of both the record first-class individual innings and the record Test individual innings.
*He is the '''all-time leading run scorer in Test cricket''', a record he attained on [[26 November]] [[2005]]. [http://www.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/TESTS/BATTING/TEST_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html]
*In the same innings, he became the second batsman to score 1000 Test runs in five different years, four days after Matthew Hayden first set the record.
* He was the fastest batsmen to score 10,000 (with [[Sachin Tendulkar]]) and 11,000 Test runs, in terms of number of innings. [http://www.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/TESTS/BATTING/FASTEST_CAREER_TEST_RUNS/]
*He has (as of 21 November [[2006]]) scored 34 centuries; joint second on the all-time list behind [[Sachin Tendulkar]].
** He has the '''most centuries for a West Indian''' and second most for all Test cricket [http://www.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/TESTS/BATTING/LEADING_BATSMEN_TEST_100S.html]
** Nine of his centuries are double centuries (surpassed only by [[Donald Bradman]] [http://usa.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/TESTS/BATTING/LEADING_BATSMEN_TEST_200S.html]) 
** Two of them are triple-centuries (matched only by Bradman [http://www.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/TESTS/BATTING/LEADING_BATSMEN_TEST_300S.html]). 
** He has scored '''centuries against all Test-playing nations'''. He achieved this feat in 2005 by scoring his first Test century against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] at the [[Kensington Oval]] in Bridgetown, Barbados.
*He became only the sixth batsman to speed from 0 to a 100 in one session, doing so against Pakistan on [[21 November]] [[2006]].  [http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/TESTS/BATTING/100_BEFORE_LUNCH.html]
*Lara has '''scored an astonishing 20% of his team runs''' [http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ausvwi/content/story/227320.html], a feat surpassed only by Bradman (23%) and [[George Headley]] (21%). Lara scored 688 runs (42% of team output, a record for a series of three or more Tests, and the second highest aggregate runs in history for a three-Test series) in the 2001-02 tour of [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]] [http://www.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/TESTS/BATTING/HI_AGG_RUNS_IN_SERIES.html].
*He also scored a century and a double century in the third Test in that same Sri Lanka tour, a feat repeated only five other times in Test cricket history [http://www.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/TESTS/BATTING/100_EACH_INNS_TEST.html].
*Lara holds the '''world record of scoring most runs in a single [[over (cricket)|over]]''' (28 runs against left-arm spinner RJ Peterson of [[South African cricket team|South Africa]]) in Test cricket [http://www.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/TESTS/BATTING/TEST_BAT_MOST_RUNS_OVER.html]. He also scored 26 runs in a single over off the bowling of Danish Kaneria at [[Multan|Multan Cricket Stadium ]] on [[21 November]] [[2006]].  
*He scored the ninth fastest Test century, doing so off 77 balls against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] on 21 November 2006. [http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/TESTS/BATTING/FASTEST_TEST_100S_50S.html]
*With 162 catches, He is second all-time in the category of most catches in a career by a non-Wicketkeeper, behind [[Mark Waugh]]. [http://www.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/TESTS/FIELDING/CATCHES_CAREER.html].
*In 1994, he was awarded the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Overseas Personality]] Award. In 1995, he was chosen as one of the [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]].
*Comfortably [[batting average|averaging]] over 50 per innings (the benchmark for batting greatness in Test cricket), Lara has been ranked the '''number one batsman in Test cricket''' in the [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] Cricket Ratings several times.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pwcratings.com |title=PricewaterhouseCoopers}}</ref>.
*Lara has played some of his best innings in recent years. [[Wisden]] published a [[Wisden 100|top 100 list]] in July 2001, a distillation of the best performances from 1,552 Tests, 54,494 innings and 29,730 bowling performances. Three innings by Lara were placed in the top 15 (the most for any batsman in that range).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2001/jul/30bat100.htm |publisher=rediff.com |work=Cricket channel |title=Top 100 Batsmen of all time}}</ref> His heroic 153 not out in [[Bridgetown, Barbados]], during West Indies' 2-2 home series draw against Australia in *[[1998]]-1999 was deemed the second greatest Test innings ever played, behind Bradman's 270 against England in the Third Test of the [[1936]]-[[1937]] series at [[Melbourne cricket ground|Melbourne]]. On [[13 October]], 2003, PricewaterhouseCoopers Ratings team published a list of top innings since 1990 under their own methodology. Lara's 213 against Australia in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] in 1999 came out to be the top innings. His 375 was placed 8th and his three other innings, including the 153 not out, were not far behind.

===Batting average===
Over 54 an innings and in [[One-day International]]s he averages over 41 an innings at a strike rate (number of runs scored per 100 balls) of close to 80. The following four graphs show his Test batting average over the years in four chronological sections:

==Personal life==
Lara is the father of an eight-year-old daughter called Sydney whom he had with Trinidadian model [[Leasel Rovedas]]. Sydney is so named as a tribute to one of Lara's favourite grounds, the Sydney Cricket Ground, where Lara scored his first Test century- the highly acclaimed 277 in the 1992-93 season.

==Trivia==
* In a 1994 Bradman Foundation charity match, Lara was dismissed by Australian women's cricket team all-rounder, [[Zoe Goss]].
* At the time that Lara made his historic 501 not out against Durham, he was sponsored by one of Levis' rivals.
* Lara loves carnival, Chinese and Italian food, and is known to be a practical joker.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
