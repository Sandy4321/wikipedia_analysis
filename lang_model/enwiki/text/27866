"'''La La'''" is a song by American singer [[Ashlee Simpson]] from her 2004 album, ''[[Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album)|Autobiography]]''. Two weeks after it became available as a digital download in mid-August 2004, it rose to No.&nbsp;37 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot Digital Tracks.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WxMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA75 |page=75 |date=August 28, 2004 |journal=Billboard |title=Billboard Hot 100 Airplay |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |volume=116 |number=35 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref> In the U.S., it began its run as the album's third and final single on radio and television in November 2004; in the United Kingdom (where it was the second single), a CD single was released in January 2005. The song's video was in heavy rotation on [[MTV]] by December 2004.<ref>{{cite journal |page=47 |date=December 18, 2004 |journal=Billboard |title=Billboard Video Monitor |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |volume=113 |number=51|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> In March 2005 the single was certified Gold, and in August the video was nominated for Best Pop Video on the [[MTV Video Music Awards]].

Simpson performed "La La" multiple times on television in 2004. On January 4, 2005, Simpson performed the song live at the halftime show of the [[Orange Bowl]] football game in Miami, Florida. She sang off-key, and after singing the last line, the stadium audience booed her.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/10/ashlee-simpson-snl-10-years-later/381800/ |title=The Fall of the House of Simpson |date=October 24, 2014 |last=O'Keefe |first=Kevin |journal=The Atlantic }}</ref> Critics compared this poor performance to Simpson's revealing miscue on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' October 23, 2004, in which she had intended to perform "Autobiography" but the earlier recording of "Pieces of Me" was heard instead, showing that Simpson had been lip-syncing.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1014196,00.html |title=Ashlee Simpson Booed at Orange Bowl Show |date=January 5, 2005 |last=Silverman |first=Stephen M. |work=People |publisher=Time, Inc.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/orange-bowl-boos-ashlee-simpson/ |title=Orange Bowl Boos Ashlee Simpson |date=January 6, 2005 |work=CBS News |last=Holguin |first=Jaime}}</ref> Simpson explained the poor performance of "La La" was the result of an equipment failure, with her [[in-ear monitors]] not working.<ref name="Orange">{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1495731/ashlee-simpson-shrugs-off-orange-bowl-booing/ |title=Ashlee Simpson Shrugs Off Orange Bowl Booing |date=January 11, 2005 |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |work=MTV News}}</ref>

==Song information==
"La La", the fourth track on ''Autobiography'', was written by Ashlee Simpson, [[Kara DioGuardi]], and [[John Shanks]], the producer of the album. Jeff Rothschild played drums on the track, Shanks played guitars and bass, and Simpson and DioGuardi did background vocals.<ref>''Autobiography'' liner notes.</ref> The track is three minutes and 42 seconds long.

The song was not initially planned as the album's third single. In October 2004 it was announced that its title track, "Autobiography", would be the third single; however, on October 29, it was announced on Simpson's official website that "Autobiography" would be replaced as the third single by "La La",<ref>[http://www.ashleesimpsonmusic.com/news/default.aspx?dt=10-01-2004 ""La La" to Be Next Single"], AshleeSimpsonMusic.com news, October 29, 2004.</ref> following Simpson's [[Ashlee Simpson#Saturday Night Live incident|''Saturday Night Live'' incident]].

Following its release as a single in the UK on January 24, 2005, "La La" debuted at number 11 before falling; it spent four weeks in the top 40.<ref>[http://www.clanhosts.com/chart/songinfo.php?id=574 "La La" chart positions], Chart Stats - UK Singles & Albums Chart Statistics.</ref> In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], it debuted at number 18 on that country's chart in late January and stayed there in the next week. In February, the song debuted at number 10 on the Australian singles chart (where it stayed for four weeks) and at number 98 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the U.S., where it eventually rose to number 86; by comparison, Simpson's first single, "[[Pieces of Me]]", had reached number 5 on the Hot 100 a few months earlier, and her second single, "[[Shadow (Ashlee Simpson song)|Shadow]]", had reached number 57. Despite this relatively low chart peak, "La La" was credited with helping boost the sales of ''Autobiography'', which rose on the charts from number 42 to number 33 (with a 61% sales increase) in one week in December 2004, soon after the single's debut.<ref>Press release, [http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/12-15-2004/0002634075&EDATE= "Ashlee Simpson Set for Early '05 Headlining Tour; Debut Album Up 61% From Last Week on Strength of New Single & Video"], PRNewswire.com, December 15, 2004.</ref> The single was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in late March 2005;<ref>RIAA.com.</ref> in Australia it was also accredited as a gold single.<ref>[http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-singles-2005.htm ARIA Charts - Accreditations - 2005 Singles], Aria.com.au.</ref>

"La La" was used as the backing music for a ThermaSilk [[shampoo]] commercial. It was also covered in the rhythm-based 2006 [[Nintendo DS]] game ''[[Elite Beat Agents]]''.

==Description==
"La La" is the most rock-oriented track on ''Autobiography'', and was described in a [[BBC]] review of the album as "energetic".<ref name=Kerrison>Roger Kerrison, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/6zxm/ ''Autobiography'' album review], BBC, September 30, 2004.</ref> Another review called it a "punk inspired, fast beat, screaming anthem".<ref>Bianca Butler, [http://youthradio.org/music/040908_ashlee.shtml ''Autobiography'' album review], Youthradio.</ref> Reactions to the song have been mixed, however: [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]] called the song "insipid" in its review of the album,<ref>''Autobiography'' album review, ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', August 2, 2004, page 41.</ref> and [[Allmusic]] said that Simpson was "trying way too hard to be sexy."<ref>Stephen Thomas Erlewine,  [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r700389|pure_url=yes}} ''Autobiography'' album review], Allmusic.</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said the song casts Simpson "as a barely legal temptress", and said "ironic or not, it's creepy."<ref>Peter Relic, [http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ashleesimpson/albums/album/6222372/rid/6294697/ ''Autobiography'' album review], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', August 5, 2004.</ref> ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' was more positive, saying that "La La" (in which it said Simpson was a "frisky bad girl") was one of the songs that could "keep ''Autobiography'' on the charts in the foreseeable future."<ref>''Autobiography'' album review, ''Billboard'', August 7, 2004.</ref> The abovementioned BBC review named the song as one of those on the album that it regarded positively,<ref name=Kerrison/> and another review said Simpson "summons a credible pop-punk sound" on "La La".<ref>[http://www.infoabouthollywood.com/view/news/3/?PHPSESSID=8f03f23f7392d93d51e718bbc9225fc9 "Fresh cuts"], Info About News, August 1, 2004.</ref>

The lyrics to the song are quite sexual, with "la la" being used as a [[euphemism]] for [[sexual intercourse|sex]] and a reference to Simpson dressing up as a [[French maid]] included; however, Simpson has described the lyrics as tongue-in-cheek: "It was one of those songs where every silly thing that was sexual that I could think of I put into the song."<ref>Chaunce Hayden, "Ashlee Simpson Sings Her Way to Number One!", ''Steppin' Out'', August 4<U+2013>10, 2004, pages 24<U+2013>25, 52<U+2013>53, 62<U+2013>63. Interview.</ref>

In one interview, Simpson said of the song:

{{cquote|Another song, 'La La' is flirty and very sexy. It's very tongue in cheek; it can be interpreted in all different ways. It's about sexual fantasies. There's a lot of sarcasm in that song. It's something every girl thinks about, so I decided to make a joke about it. It's one of the songs you can dance around to. Actually, I wrote it because I was singing la la and it was kind of a little dance that I was doing around the room. I didn't have a song on my record that was like sexy. So I thought, I'm a girl and I'm feminine and I can be sexy, so here it goes."<ref>[http://www.therecordmag.com/sep2004/ashlee.htm Interview with Ashlee Simpson], ''The Record Music Magazine'', September 2004.</ref>}}

==Music video and television performances==
Performances of "La La" featured twice in the first season of ''[[The Ashlee Simpson Show]]'', Simpson's [[reality television|reality show]], which aired in the U.S. on MTV from mid-June to early August 2004: she performed the song during her first live show in episode six, and again at the end of episode seven.

The music video for "La La", directed by [[Joseph Kahn]],<ref>Jennifer Vineyard, [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1493535/20041108/story.jhtml "Ashlee Simpson Parties Until The Break Of Dawn In New Video"], MTV News, November 8, 2004.</ref> was filmed over two days, November 11<U+2013>12, 2004.<ref name="Making">''Making the Video'', "La La", first aired November 23, 2004.</ref> It debuted on [[America Online|AOL]]'s "First View" on November 22 and on MTV's ''[[Making the Video]]'' on November 23;<ref>[http://www.tv.com/making-the-video/la-la/episode/379153/summary.html Page for the ''Making the Video'' "La La" episode], TV.com.</ref> the making of the video was also featured in episode three of the second season of ''The Ashlee Simpson Show'',<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/onair/dyn/ashlee/episode.jhtml?episodeID=86161 Episode 203: "Ashlee Turns 20"], MTV.com episode guide for ''The Ashlee Simpson Show.</ref> which aired in February 2005. Following the video's premiere, "La La" debuted at number ten on the ''TRL'' countdown on December 1, 2004; it subsequently reached number six, its peak, on its third day on the countdown. It remained on the countdown for nine days.<ref>[http://www.popfusion.net/records/recaparchive/2004_12.html TRL Archives - December 2004], Popfusion.net.</ref>

The video takes place in a [[suburb]]an setting and was filmed in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. Simpson is seen singing the song, dancing on top of a car, in front of a [[doughnut|donut]] shop, and laying on a couch playing ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3]]'' and ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4]]'' on [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], all during daylight. The video continues with a raucous late-night party around a swimming pool, which gets broken up by the police, and then Simpson and the crowd head to a [[laundromat]], where the wild partying continues. Simpson's two best friends, Lauren and Stephanie, appear alongside her in the video. Simpson compared the video to the 1982 movie ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''.<ref name="Making"/> On ''The Ashlee Simpson Show'', during the filming of the video there is a scene in which Simpson licks a couch cushion (while rolling around on it for sexual imagery), but, as she explains, it was taken out of the video because it was "a little much".

Simpson promoted the song with a number of television performances in December 2004 and January 2005 (see list below), with several UK performances in January. One of her U.S. performances, at the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] [[American football|football]] game [[halftime show]] in early January (her first time performing in a stadium), was memorable for the harsh reception the song received from the audience, with "a discernible chorus of boos" after she finished singing, according to the Associated Press. Simpson was the last of three performances during the halftime show, and she later said that there were technical problems and that she couldn't hear herself properly, making the performance more difficult for her. The cause of the booing she received has been variously attributed to a backlash against her because of her ''SNL'' incident the previous October, to the poor quality of her singing, and to the fact that the crowd was generally not in the same age bracket as her usual fans. Simpson herself said "maybe they were booing at me, maybe they were booing at the halftime show 'cause the whole thing sucked," and also said that it may have been because of the team she was supporting; "I can't make everybody happy", she said.<ref name="Orange"/> Simpson also had to change the lyrics to "La La" because of concern that they were too sexual for the show; for instance, a reference to "[[lemonade]]" replaced "French maid".

In April 2005, [[New Zealand]]'s children TV Show "What Now?" held a weekly music video poll with the song "La La" being one of the three candidates. The song was competing against "[[1, 2 Step]]" by [[Ciara]] and [[Missy Elliott]] and "[[Let Me Love You]]" by [[Mario (entertainer)|Mario]]. "La La" won the poll narrowly beating Mario who was second by a few votes. "1, 2 Step" came third.

On November 1, 2005, when Simpson was a guest on [[MuchMusic]]'s ''[[MuchOnDemand]]'' in [[Canada]], "La La" received the most votes from viewers out of three of Simpson's videos and was played. Simpson correctly guessed that "La La" would win.<ref>[http://www.muchmusic.com/tv/transcripts/index.asp?artist=1043&tranID=574 MuchOnDemand transcript], November 1, 2005.</ref>
