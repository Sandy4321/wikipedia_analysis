'''Nikola Tesla''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: {{lang|sr|<U+041D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+0430> <U+0422><U+0435><U+0441><U+043B><U+0430>}}) (10 July 1856 &ndash; 7 January 1943) was an [[inventor]] and a [[mechanical engineer|mechanical]] and [[electrical engineer]]. Born in [[Smiljan]], [[Croatian Krajina]], [[Austrian Empire]], he was an ethnic [[Serbs|Serb]] subject of the [[Austrian Empire]] and later became an [[American citizen]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5167054.stm BBC News "Electrical pioneer Tesla honoured"]</ref> Tesla is best known for many revolutionary contributions in the field of [[electricity and magnetism]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Contemporary biographers of Tesla have regarded him as "''The Father of Physics''", "''The man who invented the twentieth century''"<ref name="book">{{cite book | last=Lomas | first=Robert | title=The Man who Invented the Twentieth Century | location=London| publisher=Headline | year=1999  | isbn=0747275882 }}</ref> and "the [[patron saint]] of modern electricity."<ref>Seifer, "Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla," book synopsis</ref>  

After his demonstration of [[wireless communication]] ([[radio]]) in 1894 and after being the victor in the "[[War of Currents]]", he was widely respected as one of the greatest electrical engineers who worked in America.<ref>[http://news.suc.org/people/tesla/index.html Serbian Unity Congress | 150 Years of Nikola Tesla]</ref> Much of his early work pioneered modern electrical engineering and many of his discoveries were of groundbreaking importance.

The [[SI]] unit measuring [[magnetic flux density]] or [[magnetic]] induction (commonly known as the [[magnetic field]] '''B'''), the [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]], was named in his honour (at the ''Conf<U+00E9>rence G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale des Poids et Mesures'', [[Paris]], 1960).

Aside from his work on [[electromagnetism]] and [[electromechanical]] [[engineering]], Tesla is said to have contributed in varying degrees to the establishment of [[robotics]], [[remote control]], [[radar]] and computer science, and to the expansion of [[ballistics]], [[nuclear physics]],<ref>Cheney, Margaret, "Tesla: Man Out of Time", 1979.

Tesla is honored in [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]], as well as in the [[Czech Republic]]. He was awarded the highest order of the [[Order of the White Lion|White Lion]] by [[Czechoslovakia]]. Because of this, he is alternately considered a luminary in the field of science and one of the symbols of personified pride for eastern Europe.

==Biography==
===Early years===
[[Image:Nikola Tesla Memorial Center.JPG|thumb|200px|Nikola Tesla's birth house and statue in [[Smiljan]]]]

Tesla was born to Serbian parents in the village of [[Smiljan]] near [[Gospi<U+0107>]], in the [[Lika]] region of the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]]. According to legend, he was born precisely at midnight during an [[electrical storm]].

His baptism certificate reports that he was born on 28 June <small>([[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]] 10 July)</small>, 1856, and [[infant baptism|christened]] by the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] priest Toma Oklobd<U+017E>ija. His father was Rev. Milutin Tesla, a priest in the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] Metropolitanate of [[Sremski Karlovci]]. Milutin was born on 19 February 1819 in the village of Raduc, county Medak in Lika, Austrian Empire, as son of Nikola Tesla (b. 1789 in the military frontier, settled after his service in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in Gospic in 1815) and Ana Kalini<U+0107>, from the famous frontier [[Kalinic]] family. Tesla's family asserted its last name as such in Lika. His paternal origin is thought to be of the Dragani<U+0107> family from the  [[Tara River (Montenegro)|Tara]] valley area below the geographical entity known as [[Old Vlach]], from one of the local [[Serb clans]]; however genealogical research{{Fact|date=June 2008}} shows that Nikola is from the Herzegovinian noble [[Komnenovi<U+0107>]] (modern-day [[Old Herzegovina]] in Montenegro), from its [[Orlovi<U+0107>]] subgroup that traces its origin from medieval nobleman [[Pavle Orlovic]]<ref>{{cite book | author=Obrad Mi<U+0107>ov Samard<U+017E>i<U+0107>,  "Porijeklo Samard<U+017E>i<U+0107>a i ostalih bratstava roda Orlovi<U+0107>a", Mostar 1992.}}</ref> that bore [[Prince Lazar]]'s banner at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389. His mother was <U+0110>uka Mandi<U+0107>, herself a daughter of a [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] priest. She came from a family domiciled in Lika and [[Banija]], but with deeper origins to [[Kosovo]]. She was talented in making home craft tools. She memorized many [[Serbian epic poetry|Serbian epic poems]], but never learned to read.<ref>Seifer, "Wizard" p.&nbsp;7</ref> His godfather, Jovan Drenovac, was a captain in the army protecting the [[Military Frontier]].

Nikola was the fourth of five children, having one older brother (Dane, who was killed in a [[Equestrianism|horse-riding]] accident when Nikola was five) and three sisters (Milka, Angelina and Marica).<ref name="cheney-uth-glenn-99">Margaret Cheney, Robert Uth, and Jim Glenn, "Tesla, Master of Lightning". Barnes & Noble Publishing, 1999. ISBN .</ref>{{rp|3}} His family moved to [[Gospi<U+0107>]] in 1862. Tesla went to school in [[Karlovac]]. He finished a four year term in the span of three years.<ref>Walker, E. H. (1900).

[[Image:Tesla young.jpg|thumb|left|c.1879 at age 23]]

Tesla then studied [[electrical engineering]] at the [[Graz University of Technology|Austrian Polytechnic]] in [[Graz]] (1875). While there, he studied the uses of alternating current. Some sources say he received Baccalaureate degrees from the university at Graz.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Wysock |first= W.C. |coauthors= J.F. Corum, J.M. Hardesty and K.L.

He went to [[Maribor]], [[Slovenia]], where he was first employed as an assistant engineer for a year. He suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] during this time. Tesla was later persuaded by his father to attend the [[Charles University in Prague|Charles-Ferdinand University]] in [[Prague]], which he attended for the summer term of 1880. Here he was influenced by [[Ernst Mach]]. However after his father died he left the university, having completed only one term.<ref name="seifer-96">{{cite book |last= Seifer |first= Marc |title= Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla; Biography of a Genius |publisher= Carol Publishing Group |date= 1996 |location= Secaucus, NJ |id= ISBN}}</ref>

Tesla engaged in reading many works, memorizing complete books, supposedly having a [[photographic memory]].<ref name="cheney-79">{{cite book |last= Cheney |first= Margaret |title= Tesla: Man Out of Time |origyear= 1979 |url= http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN&id=ti2Jt7XarzMC |accessdate=  |year= 2001 |publisher= [[Simon and Schuster]] |isbn=  }}</ref> Tesla related in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was stricken with illness time and time again. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by hallucinations. Much of the time the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; just by hearing the name of an item, he would involuntarily envision it in realistic detail. Modern-day [[synesthesia|synesthetes]] report similar symptoms. Tesla would visualise an invention in his brain in precise form before moving to the construction stage; a technique sometimes known as [[picture thinking]]. Tesla also often had flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life; this began to happen during childhood.<ref name="cheney-79" />

====Hungary and France====
In 1881, he moved to [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], to work under [[Tivadar Pusk<U+00E1>s]] in a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] company,<ref>James Grant Wilson, John Fiske, ''Appleton's Cyclop<U+00E6>dia of American Biography''. P.&nbsp;261.</ref>
the National [[Telephone company|Telephone Company]]. There, he met Neboj<U+0161>a Petrovi<U+0107>, a young inventor from Austria. Although their encounter was brief, they did work on a project together using twin turbines to create continual power. On the opening of the [[telephone]] exchange in Budapest, 1881, Tesla became the chief electrician to the company, and was later engineer for the country's first telephone system. He also developed a device that, according to some, was a [[telephone]] [[repeater]] or [[amplifier]], but according to others could have been the first [[loudspeaker]].<ref>"''[http://www.tfcbooks.com/teslafaq/q&a_040.htm Did Tesla really invent the loudspeaker?]''". [[21st century|Twenty First Century]] Books, Breckenridge, CO.</ref>
In 1882 he moved to [[Paris]], France, to work as an engineer for the ''Continental Edison Company'', designing improvements to electric equipment. In the same year, Tesla conceived the [[induction motor]] and began developing various devices that use [[rotating magnetic field]]s for which he received patents in 1888.

Soon thereafter, Tesla hastened from Paris to his mother's side as she lay dying, arriving hours before her death in April, 1882.<ref>{{cite book

Her last words to him were: "You've arrived, Nid<U+017E>o, my pride." After her death, Tesla fell ill. He spent two to three weeks recuperating in Gospi<U+0107> and the village of ''Tomingaj'' near [[Gra<U+010D>ac]], his mother's birthplace.

====United States====
On 6 June 1884, Tesla first arrived in the US in [[New York City]].<ref>"Master of Lightning" by [[Public Broadcasting Service]]. [http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ Website]</ref>
He had little besides a letter of recommendation from [[Charles Batchelor]], his manager in his previous job. In the letter of recommendation to [[Thomas Edison]], Charles Batchelor wrote, "I know two great men and you are one of them; the other is this young man." Edison hired Tesla to work for his ''Edison Machine Works''. Tesla's work for Edison began with simple electrical engineering and quickly progressed to solving the company's most difficult problems. Tesla was offered the task of a complete redesign of the Edison company's [[direct current]] [[electrical generator|generators]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Tesla Says Edison was an Empiricist.

During 1885, when Tesla inquired about the payment on the work, Edison replied to him, "Tesla, you don't understand our American humor" and reneged on his promise.<ref> Clifford A.

With Tesla's salary of US$18 per week, the bonus would have amounted to over 53 years pay. The amount was equal to the initial capital of the company. Tesla resigned when he was refused a raise to US$25 per week.<ref>Jonnes,"Empire of light" p. 110</ref>

Tesla eventually found himself digging ditches for a short period of time <U+2013> coincidentally for the Edison company. Edison had also never wanted to hear about Tesla's AC polyphase designs, believing that DC electricity was the future. Tesla focused intently on his AC polyphase system, even while digging ditches.<ref name="cheney-79" />

===Middle years===
In 1886, Tesla formed his own company, ''[[Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing]]''. The initial financial [[investor]]s disagreed with Tesla on his plan for an alternating current motor and eventually relieved him of his duties at the company. Tesla worked in [[New York]] as a common laborer from 1886 to 1887 to feed himself and raise capital for his next project. In 1887, he constructed the initial [[brush (electric)|brushless]] alternating current [[induction motor]], which he demonstrated to the ''American Institute of Electrical Engineers'' (now [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]]) in 1888. In the same year, he developed the principles of his [[Tesla coil]] and began working with [[George Westinghouse]] at [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company's]] [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] labs. Westinghouse listened to his ideas for polyphase systems which would allow transmission of alternating current electricity over long distances.

In April of 1887, Tesla began investigating what would later be called [[X-ray]]s using his own single node [[vacuum tube]]s (similar to his patent {{US patent||#514,170}}). This device differed from other early X-ray tubes in that they had no target electrode. The modern term for the phenomenon produced by this device is ''[[bremsstrahlung]]'' (or ''braking radiation''). We now know that this device operated by emitting [[electron]]s from the single electrode through a combination of [[field emission]] and [[thermionic emission]]. Once liberated, electrons are strongly repelled by the high [[electric field]] near the electrode during negative voltage peaks from the oscillating HV output of the Tesla Coil, generating X-rays as they collide with the glass envelope. He also used [[Geissler tube]]s. By 1892, Tesla became aware of what [[Wilhelm R<U+00F6>ntgen]] later identified as effects of X-rays.

In the early research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the "instrument will [... enable one to] generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus".<ref>N. Tesla, "High frequency oscillators for electro-therapeutic and other purposes". ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=0ulmMIkNisnAACpaud&id=bUo7vYNkbKQC Proceedings of the American Electro-Therapeutic Association]'', American Electro-Therapeutic Association. Page&nbsp;25.</ref>
He also commented on the hazards of working with his circuit and single node X-ray producing devices. Of his many notes in the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. One of the options for the cause, which is not in conformity with conventional X-ray production, was that the [[ozone]] generated rather than the radiation was responsible. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not due to the Roentgen rays, but the ozone generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, [[Nitrous acid]]. Tesla held that these were in fact [[longitudinal wave]]s, such as those produced in [[waves in plasma]]. In a plasma or a confined space, there can exist waves which are either longitudinal or transverse, or a mixture of both. There are known examples of this and these plasma waves can occur in the situation of [[force-free magnetic field]]s.<ref>Griffiths, David J. ''Introduction to Electrodynamics''   and Jackson, John D. ''Classical Electrodynamics''</ref><ref>N. Tesla, "High frequency oscillators for electro-therapeutic and other purposes". ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=0ulmMIkNisnAACpaud&id=bUo7vYNkbKQC Proceedings of the American Electro-Therapeutic Association]'', American Electro-Therapeutic Association. Page&nbsp;16.</ref> His hypotheses and experiments were confirmed by others.<ref> George Frederick Shrady, Thomas Lathrop Stedman, ''Medical Record'', 1897. [http://books.google.com/books?id=Jx4CAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA288&lr=&as_brr=1#PPA287,M1 Page 287].</ref>

Tesla continued research in the field and, later, observed an assistant severely "burnt" by X-rays in his lab. He performed several experiments prior to [[Wilhelm Conrad R<U+00F6>ntgen|Roentgen's]] discovery (including [[photograph]]ing the bones of his hand; later, he sent these images to Roentgen) but didn't make his findings widely known; much of his research was lost in the 5th Avenue lab fire of March 1895.

A "world system" for "the transmission of electrical energy without wires" that depends upon the electrical conductivity was proposed in which transmission in various natural media with current that passes between the two point are used to power devices. In a practical wireless energy transmission system using this principle, a high-power ultraviolet beam might be used to form a vertical ionized channel in the air directly above the transmitter-receiver stations. The same concept is used in virtual [[lightning rod]]s, the [[electrolaser]] [[electroshock weapon]],<ref>[http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA A Survey of Laser Lightning Rod Techniques] - Barnes, Arnold A., Jr. ; Berthel, Robert O.</ref>

Tesla demonstrated "the transmission of electrical energy without wires" that depends upon electrical conductivity as early as 1891. The ''[[Tesla effect]]'' (named in honor of Tesla) is the archaic term for an application of this type of electrical conduction (that is, the movement of energy through space and matter; not just the production of voltage across a conductor).<ref>Norrie, H. S., "Induction Coils: How to make, use, and repair them". Norman H. Schneider, 1907, New York. 4th edition.</ref><ref name="cheney-79" />{{rp|174}}

[[Image:TeslaWirelessPower1891 adjusted.png|thumb|left|333px|[[Wireless energy transfer|Wireless transmission of power and energy]] demonstration during his high frequency and potential lecture of 1891.]]

On 30 July 1891, he became a [[Naturalization|naturalized citizen]] of the United States at the age of 35. Tesla established his 35 South [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] laboratory in New York during this same year. Later, Tesla would establish his Houston Street laboratory in New York at 46 E. [[Houston Street]]. There, at one point while conducting [[mechanical resonance]] experiments with electro-mechanical oscillators he generated a resonance of several surrounding buildings but, due to the frequencies involved, not his own building, causing complaints to the police. As the speed grew he hit the [[Resonance|resonant frequency]] of his own building and belatedly realizing the danger he was forced to apply a [[Sledgehammer|sledge hammer]] to terminate the experiment, just as the astonished police arrived.<ref>O'Neill, "Prodigal Genius" pp&nbsp;162-164</ref>
He also lit vacuum tubes wirelessly at both of the New York locations, providing evidence for the potential of [[Wireless energy transfer|wireless power transmission]].<ref>Krumme, Katherine, ''[http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/dept/Courses/E-24/E-24Projects/Krumme1.pdf Mark Twain and Nikola Tesla: Thunder and Lightning]''. 4 December 2000 ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]])</ref>
Some of Tesla's closest friends were artists. He befriended ''[[The Century Magazine|Century Magazine]]'' editor [[Robert Underwood Johnson]], who adapted several Serbian poems of [[Jovan Jovanovic Zmaj|Jovan Jovanovi<U+0107> Zmaj]] (which Tesla translated). Also during this time, Tesla was influenced by the [[Vedanta|Vedic philosophy]] teachings of the [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref>Grotz, Toby, "''[http://arizonaenergy.org/CommunityEnergy/INFLUENCE%20OF%20VEDIC%20ON%20TESLA'S%20UNDERSTANDING%20OF%20FREE%20ENERGY.htm The Influence of Vedic Philosophy on Nikola Tesla's Understanding of Free Energy]''".</ref>

When Tesla was 36 years old, the first patents concerning the polyphase power system were granted. He continued research of the system and rotating magnetic field principles. Tesla served, from 1892 to 1894, as the vice president of the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]], the forerunner (along with the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]]) of the modern-day [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]]. From 1893 to 1895, he investigated [[high frequency]] alternating currents. He generated AC of one million [[volt]]s using a conical Tesla coil and investigated the ''[[skin effect]]'' in [[Electrical conductor|conductors]], designed tuned circuits, invented a machine for inducing sleep, cordless [[gas discharge]] lamps, and transmitted [[Electrical energy|electromagnetic energy]] without wires, building the first [[transmitter|radio transmitter]]. In [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], Tesla made a demonstration related to [[radio]] communication in 1893. Addressing the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] and the [[National Electric Light Association]], he described and demonstrated in detail its principles. Tesla's demonstrations were written about widely through various media outlets. Tesla also investigated harvesting [[Cosmic background radiation|energy that is present throughout space]]. He believed that it was just merely a question of time when men will succeed in attaching their machinery to the very wheelwork of nature, stating:
{{cquote|Ere many generations pass, our machinery will be driven by a power obtainable at any point of the universe.|30px|30px|"Experiments With Alternate Currents Of High Potential And High Frequency" (February 1892)}}

At the 1893 [[World's Fair]], the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]], an international exposition was held which for the first time devoted a building to electrical exhibits. It was a historic event as Tesla and [[George Westinghouse]] introduced visitors to [[AC power]] by using it to illuminate the Exposition. On display were Tesla's [[fluorescent lamp]]s and single node bulbs. An observer noted: 
{{quote|Within the room was suspended two hard-rubber plates covered with tin foil. These were about fifteen feet apart, and served as terminals of the wires leading from the transformers. When the current was turned on, the vacuum bulbs or tubes, which had no wires connected to them, but lay on a table between the suspended plates, or which might be held in the hand in almost any part of the room, were made luminous. These were the same experiments and the same apparatus shown by Mr. Tesla in London about two years ago, where they produced so much wonder and astonishment.<ref>John Patrick Barrett, ''Electricity at the Columbian Exposition''. R.R. Donnelley  1894 (World's Columbian Exposition, 1893, Chicago, Ill.) Page 168-169</ref>}}
Tesla also explained the principles of the rotating magnetic field and [[induction motor]] by demonstrating how to make an egg made of [[copper]] stand on end in his demonstration of the device he constructed known as the "''[[Tesla's Egg of Columbus|Egg of Columbus]]''".

[[Image:US390721.png|thumb|left|200px|Nikola Tesla's AC [[dynamo]] used to generate AC which is used to transport [[electricity]] across great distances. It is contained in {{US patent||US}}.]]
Also in the late 1880s, Tesla and Edison became adversaries in part due to Edison's promotion of direct current (DC) for [[electric power]] distribution over the more efficient alternating current advocated by Tesla and Westinghouse. Until Tesla invented the induction motor, AC's advantages for long distance [[high voltage]] transmission were counterbalanced by the inability to operate motors on AC. As a result of the "[[War of Currents]]," Edison and Westinghouse went nearly bankrupt, so in 1897, Tesla released Westinghouse from contract, providing Westinghouse a break from Tesla's patent royalties. Also in 1897, Tesla researched [[Particle radiation|radiation]] which led to setting up the basic formulation of [[cosmic ray]]s.<ref>Waser, Andr<U+00E9>, "''Nikola Tesla<U+2019>s Radiations and the Cosmic Rays''".</ref>

When Tesla was forty-one years old, he filed the first basic radio patent ({{US patent|645,576}}). A year later, he demonstrated a [[radio control|radio-controlled]] boat to the US military, believing that the military would want things such as radio-controlled [[torpedo]]es. Tesla had developed the "''Art of [[Telautomatics]]''", a form of [[robotics]], as well as the technology of remote control.<ref>Tesla, Nikola, "''[http://www.teslaplay.com/autobody.htm My Inventions]''", Electrical Experimenter magazine, Feb, June, and Oct, 1919. ISBN (teslaplay.comversion; [http://www.rastko.org.yu/istorija/tesla/ntesla-autobiography.html also the version at rastko.org])</ref> In 1898, a radio-controlled boat was demonstrated to the public during an electrical exhibition at [[Madison Square Garden]]. These devices had an innovative [[coherer]] and a series of [[logic gate]]s. Tesla called his boat a "teleautomaton" and said of it, "You see there the first of a race of robots, mechanical men which will do the laborious work of the human race."<ref>Jonnes, Jill. ''Empires of Light'' ISBN . Page&nbsp;355, referencing O'Neill, John J., ''Prodigal Genius: The Life of Nikola Tesla'' (New York: David McKay, 1944), p.&nbsp;167.</ref> Radio remote control remained a novelty until the 1960s. In the same year, Tesla devised an "electric igniter" or [[spark plug]] for [[Internal combustion engine|Internal combustion]] gasoline engines. He gained {{US patent|609,250}}, "Electrical Igniter for Gas Engines", on this [[ignition system|mechanical ignition system]]. Tesla lived in the former Gerlach Hotel, renamed The Radio Wave building, at 49 W 27th St. (between Broadway and Sixth Avenue), [[Lower Manhattan]], before the end of the century where he conducted the radio wave experiments. A [[commemorative plaque]] was placed on the building in 1977 to honor his work.

====Colorado Springs====
{{main|Magnifying transmitter}}

The arcs are about 7&nbsp;meters (23&nbsp;ft) long. (Tesla's notes identify this as a [[multiple exposure]] photograph.)]]
[[Image:TeslaWirelessLightsCS.png|right|thumb|250px|An experiment in Colorado Springs. This bank of lights is receiving power from a distant transmitter]]
In 1899, Tesla decided to move and began research in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], where he would have room for his high-voltage, high-frequency experiments. Upon his arrival he told reporters that he was conducting [[wireless telegraphy]] experiments transmitting signals from [[Pikes Peak]] to Paris. Tesla's diary contains explanations of his experiments concerning the [[ionosphere]] and the ground's [[telluric current]]s via [[transverse wave]]s and [[longitudinal wave]]s.<ref>Tesla, Nikola, "The True Wireless". ''Electrical Experimenter'', May 1919. ([http://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art06.html also at pbs.org])</ref>
At his lab, Tesla proved that the earth was a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], and he produced artificial [[lightning]] (with discharges consisting of millions of volts, and up to 135&nbsp;feet long).<ref>Gillispie, Charles Coulston, "''Dictionary of Scientific Biography''"; ''Tesla, Nikola''. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. ISBN</ref>
Tesla also investigated [[atmospheric electricity]], observing lightning signals via his receivers. Reproductions of Tesla's receivers and coherer circuits show an unpredicted level of complexity (e.g., [[Distributed element model|distributed]] [[Q factor|high-Q]] [[Helix|helical]] [[cavity resonator|resonators]], [[radio frequency]] [[feedback]], crude [[heterodyne]] effects, and [[Regenerative circuit|regeneration techniques]]).<ref>Corum, K. L., J. F. Corum, and A. H. Aidinejad, "''Atmospheric Fields, Tesla's Receivers and Regenerative Detectors''". 1994.</ref>
Tesla stated that he observed [[stationary wave]]s during this time.<ref>Corum, K. L., J. F. Corum, "''Nikola Tesla, Lightning Observations, and Stationary Waves''". 1994.</ref>

Tesla researched ways to [[Wireless energy transfer|transmit power and energy wirelessly]] over long distances (via transverse waves, to a lesser extent, and, more readily, longitudinal waves). He transmitted extremely low frequencies through the ground as well as between the earth's surface and the [[Kennelly-Heaviside layer]]. He received patents on wireless transceivers that developed standing waves by this method. In his experiments, he made mathematical calculations and computations based on his experiments and discovered that the resonant frequency of the Earth was approximately 8 Hertz (Hz). In the 1950s, researchers confirmed that the resonant frequency of the Earth's ionospheric cavity was in this range (later named the [[Schumann resonance]]).

[[Image:TeslaWirelessIllustration.png|left|99px|thumb|Colorado Springs experiment where grounded tuned coil is in resonance with distant transmitter; Light is glowing near the bottom.]]
In Colorado, Tesla carried out various long distance power transmission experiments. ''Tesla effect'' is the application of a type of electrical conduction (that is, the movement of energy through space and matter; not just the production of voltage across a conductor).  Through [[longitudinal wave]]s, Tesla transferred energy to receiving devices. He sent electrostatic forces through natural media across a conductor situated in the changing magnetic flux and transferred power to a conducting receiving device (such as Tesla's wireless bulbs). 

In the Colorado Springs lab, Tesla observed unusual signals that he later thought may have been evidence of [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] radio communications coming from [[Venus]] or [[Mars]].<ref>Tesla, Nikola, "''[http://earlyradiohistory.us/1901talk.htm Talking with Planets]''". Collier's Weekly, 19 February 1901. (EarlyRadioHistory.us)</ref>
He noticed repetitive signals from his receiver which were substantially different from the signals he had noted from storms and earth noise. Specifically, he later recalled that the signals appeared in groups of one, two, three, and four clicks together. Tesla had mentioned before this event and many times after that he thought his inventions could be used to [[Teslascope#Talking with planets|talk with other planets]]. There have even been claims that he invented a "''[[Teslascope]]''" for just such a purpose. It is debatable what type of signals Tesla received or whether he picked up anything at all. Research has suggested that Tesla may have had a misunderstanding of the new technology he was working with,<ref>{{cite book| last =Spencer| first =John| title =The UFO Encyclopedia| publisher =[[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]]| date =1991| location =New York| isbn = | oclc =  }}</ref>
or that the signals Tesla observed may have simply been an observation of a non-terrestrial natural radio source such as the [[Jupiter|Jovian]] [[Jupiter's magnetosphere|plasma torus]] signals.<ref>{{cite book| last =Corum| first =Kenneth L.| coauthors =James F. Corum| title =Nikola Tesla and the electrical signals of planetary origin| date =1996| pages =14|oclc = }}</ref>

Tesla left [[Colorado Springs]] on 7 January 1900. The lab was torn down and its contents sold to pay debts. The Colorado experiments prepared Tesla for his next project, the establishment of a [[wireless power transmission]] facility that would be known as Wardenclyffe. Tesla was granted {{US patent|685,012}} for the means of increasing the intensity of electrical oscillations. The [[United States Patent Office]] classification system currently assigns this patent to the primary Class 178/43 ("telegraphy/space induction"), although the other applicable classes include 505/825 ("low temperature superconductivity-related apparatus").

===Later years===
[[Image:BrochureWardenclyffe .PNG|thumb|The [[Wardenclyffe Tower]]'' facility.]]
In 1900, with US$150,000 (51&nbsp;% from [[J. Pierpont Morgan]]), Tesla began planning the ''[[Wardenclyffe Tower]]'' facility. In June 1902, Tesla's lab operations were moved to Wardenclyffe from Houston Street. The tower was finally dismantled for scrap during [[World War I]]. Newspapers of the time labeled Wardenclyffe "Tesla's million-dollar folly". In 1904, the US [[Patent office|Patent Office]] reversed its decision and awarded [[Guglielmo Marconi]] the patent for radio, and Tesla began his fight to re-acquire the radio patent. On his 50th birthday in 1906, Tesla demonstrated his 200&nbsp;[[horsepower|hp]] (150&nbsp;kW) 16,000&nbsp;rpm [[tesla turbine|bladeless turbine]]. During 1910&ndash;1911 at the ''Waterside Power Station'' in New York, several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100&ndash;5000&nbsp;hp.

Since the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was awarded to [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] for radio in 1909, [[Thomas Edison]] and Tesla were mentioned as potential laureates to share the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize of 1915]] in a press dispatch, leading to one of several [[Nobel Prize controversies]]. Some sources have claimed that due to their animosity toward each other neither was given the award, despite their enormous scientific contributions, and that each sought to minimize the other one's achievements and right to win the award, that both refused to ever accept the award if the other received it first, and that both rejected any possibility of sharing it.<ref> O'Neill, "Prodigal Genius" pp&nbsp;228-229</ref>
In the following events after the rumors, neither Tesla nor Edison won the prize (although Edison did receive one of 38 possible bids in 1915, and Tesla did receive one bid out of 38 in 1937).<ref>Seifer, "Wizard" pp&nbsp;378-380</ref>
Earlier, Tesla alone was rumored to have been nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize of 1912]]. The rumored nomination was primarily for his experiments with tuned circuits using high-voltage high-frequency resonant transformers.

In 1915, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Marconi attempting, unsuccessfully, to obtain a court injunction against Marconi's claims. After Wardenclyffe, Tesla built the [[Telefunken]] Wireless Station in Sayville, Long Island. Some of what he wanted to achieve at Wardenclyffe was accomplished with the Telefunken Wireless. In 1917, the facility was seized and torn down by the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], because it was suspected that it could be used by German spies.

Before [[World War I]], Tesla looked overseas for investors to fund his research. When the war started, Tesla lost the funding he was receiving from his patents in European countries. After the war ended, Tesla made predictions regarding the relevant issues of the post-World War I environment, in a printed article (20 December 1914). Tesla believed that the [[League of Nations]] was not a remedy for the times and issues. Tesla started to exhibit pronounced symptoms of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] in the years following. He became obsessed with the number three; he often felt compelled to walk around a block three times before entering a building, demanded a stack of three folded cloth napkins beside his plate at every meal, etc. The nature of OCD was little understood at the time and no treatments were available, so his symptoms were considered by some to be evidence of partial insanity, and this undoubtedly hurt what was left of his reputation.

At this time, he was staying at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], renting in an arrangement for deferred payments. Eventually, the Wardenclyffe deed was turned over to [[George Boldt]], proprietor of the Waldorf-Astoria, to pay a US$20,000 debt. In 1917, around the time that the Wardenclyffe Tower was demolished by Boldt to make the land a more viable real estate asset, Tesla received [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers|AIEE's]] highest honor, the [[Edison Medal]].

Tesla, in August 1917, first established principles regarding frequency and power level for the first primitive [[RADAR]] units.<ref>Page, R.M., "''The Early History of RADAR''", Proceedings of the IRE, Volume 50, Number 5, May, 1962, (special 50th Anniversary Issue).</ref>
In 1934, [[<U+00C9>mile Girardeau]], working with the first French RADAR systems, stated he was building RADAR systems "conceived according to the principles stated by Tesla". By the 1920s, Tesla was reportedly negotiating with the United Kingdom government about a ray system. Tesla had also stated that efforts had been made to steal the so called "death ray". It is suggested that the removal of the [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] government ended negotiations.

On Tesla's seventy-fifth birthday in 1931, [[Time magazine]] put him on its cover. The cover caption noted his contribution to [[Electricity generation|electrical power generation]]. Tesla received his last patent in 1928 for an apparatus for [[Aviation|aerial transportation]] which was the first instance of [[Vertical take-off and landing|VTOL]] [[aircraft]]. By the end of 1931, Tesla released "''On Future Motive Power''" which covered an [[ocean thermal energy conversion]] system. In 1934, Tesla wrote to consul Jankovi<U+0107> of his homeland. The letter contained a message of gratitude to [[Mihajlo Pupin]] who had initiated a donation scheme by which American companies could support Tesla. Tesla refused the assistance, choosing instead to live on a modest pension received from Yugoslavia, and to continue his research.

In 1936, Tesla wrote in a telegram to [[Vladko Ma<U+010D>ek]]: "I'm equally proud of my Serbian origin and my Croatian homeland. Long live all Yugoslavs."<ref>http://www.teslasociety.com/teslavillage.htm ''Tesla'' telegram to Vladko Ma<U+010D>ek</ref>

====Field theories====
When he was eighty-one, Tesla stated he had completed a "dynamic theory of gravity". He stated that it was "worked out in all details" and that he hoped to soon give it to the world.<ref>[http://www.tesla.hu/tesla/articles/19370710.doc Prepared Statement by Nikola Tesla] downloadable from www.tesla.hu</ref>
The theory was never published. At the time of his announcement, it was considered by the scientific establishment to exceed the bounds of reason. Some believe that Tesla never fully developed the [[Unified Field Theory]].

The bulk of the theory was developed between 1892 and 1894, during the period that he was conducting experiments with [[high frequency]] and high [[potential]] electromagnetism and patenting devices for their utilization. It was completed, according to Tesla, by the end of the 1930s. Tesla's theory explained gravity using [[electrodynamics]] consisting of [[transverse wave]]s (to a lesser extent) and [[longitudinal wave]]s (for the majority). Reminiscent of [[Mach's principle]], Tesla stated in 1925 that:

[[Image:Teslathinker.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Nikola Tesla, with [[Roger Joseph Boscovich|Ru<U+0111>er Bo<U+0161>kovi<U+0107>]]'s book ''Theoria Philosophiae Naturalis'', sits in front of the spiral coil of his high-frequency transformer at East Houston Street, New York.]]
{{cquote|There is no thing endowed with life&mdash;from man, who is enslaving the elements, to the nimblest creature&mdash;in all this world that does not sway in its turn. Whenever action is born from force, though it be infinitesimal, the cosmic balance is upset and the universal motion results.}}

Tesla was critical of Einstein's relativity work, calling it:
{{cquote|...[a] magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors. The theory is like a beggar clothed in purple whom ignorant people take for a king&nbsp;... its exponents are brilliant men but they are metaphysicists rather than scientists&nbsp;...<ref>New York Times, 11 July 1935, p&nbsp;23, c.8</ref>}}

Tesla also argued:

{{cquote|I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.<ref>[[New York Herald Tribune]], 11 September 1932</ref>}}

Tesla also believed that much of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[Theory of relativity|relativity theory]] had already been proposed by [[Ru<U+0111>er Bo<U+0161>kovi<U+0107>]], stating in an unpublished interview: {{cquote|...the relativity theory, by the way, is much older than its present proponents. It was advanced over 200 years ago by my illustrious countryman Ru<U+0111>er Bo<U+0161>kovi<U+0107>, the great philosopher, who, not withstanding other and multifold obligations, wrote a thousand volumes of excellent literature on a vast variety of subjects. Bo<U+0161>kovi<U+0107> dealt with relativity, including the so-called time-space continuum&nbsp;...'.<ref>1936 unpublished interview, quoted in Anderson, L, ed. Nikola Tesla: Lecture Before the New York Academy of Sciences: The Streams of Lenard and Roentgen and Novel Apparatus for Their Production, 6 April 1897, reconstructed 1994</ref>}}

====Directed-energy weapon====
Later in life, Tesla made remarkable claims concerning a "[[teleforce]]" weapon.<ref>"Tesla's Ray". Time, 23 July 1934.</ref>  The press called it a "peace ray" or [[death ray]].<ref>"Tesla, at 78, Bares New 'Death-Beam"', New York Times, 11 July 1934.</ref><ref> "Tesla Invents Peace Ray". New York Sun, 10 July 1934.</ref>
In total, the components and methods included:<ref>"Death-Ray Machine Described", New York Sun, 11 July 1934.</ref><ref> "A Machine to End War". Feb. 1935.</ref>
*An apparatus for producing manifestations of energy in free air instead of in a [[Vacuum|high vacuum]] as in the past. This, according to Tesla in 1934, was accomplished.
*A mechanism for generating tremendous electrical force. This, according to Tesla, was also accomplished.
*A means of intensifying and amplifying the force developed by the second mechanism.
*A new method for producing a tremendous electrical repelling force. This would be the projector, or gun, of the invention.

Tesla worked on plans for a [[directed-energy weapon]] from the early 1900s until his death. In 1937, Tesla composed a treatise entitled "''The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media''" concerning [[charged particle beam]]s.<ref>Seifer, Marc J., "Wizard, the Life and Times of Nikola Tesla". ISBN (HC) p.&nbsp;454</ref>
Tesla published the document in an attempt to expound on the technical description of a "[[superweapon]] that would put an end to all war". This treatise of the [[particle beam]] is currently in the [[Nikola Tesla Museum]] archive in [[Belgrade]]. It described an open ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allowed particles to exit, a method of charging particles to millions of volts, and a method of creating and directing nondispersive particle streams (through [[electrostatic]] repulsion).<ref>Seifer, "Wizard" p.&nbsp;454</ref>

His records indicate that it was based on a narrow stream of [[Superatom|atomic clusters]] of liquid [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[tungsten]] accelerated via high voltage (by means akin to his [[Magnifying transmitter|magnifying transformer]]). Tesla gave the following description concerning the ''[[Charged particle beam|particle gun]]'''s operation:
{{cquote|[The nozzle would] send concentrated beams of particles through the free air, of such tremendous energy that they will bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 200 miles from a defending nation's border and will cause armies to drop dead in their tracks.<ref>"Beam to Kill Army at 200 Miles, Tesla's Claim on 78th Birthday". New York Times, 11 July 1934.</ref>}} The weapon could be used against ground based infantry or for antiaircraft purposes.<ref>"'Death Ray' for Planes". New York Times, 22 September 1940.</ref>
Tesla tried to interest the [[United States Department of Defense|US War Department]] in the device.<ref>"Aerial Defense 'Death-Beam' Offered to U. S. By Tesla" 12 July 1940</ref>
He also offered this invention to European countries.<ref>O'Neill, John J., "[http://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art12.html Tesla Tries To Prevent World War II]". (unpublished Chapter 34 of Prodigal Genius) (PBS)</ref>
None of the governments purchased a contract to build the device. He was unable to act on his plans.<ref> Velox, [http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id= Particle beam weapon]. everything2.com</ref>

====Theoretical inventions====
Tesla began to theorize about electricity and magnetism's power to warp, or rather change, [[space]] and [[time]] and the procedure by which man could forcibly control this power. Near the end of his life, Tesla was fascinated with the idea of light as both a [[Elementary particle|particle]] and a [[wave]], a fundamental proposition already incorporated into [[quantum physics]]. This field of inquiry led to the idea of creating a "wall of light" by manipulating [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] in a certain pattern. This mysterious wall of light would enable time, space, gravity and matter to be altered at will, and engendered an array of Tesla proposals that seem to leap straight out of [[science fiction]], including [[anti-gravity]] airships, [[teleportation]], and [[time travel]]. The single strangest invention Tesla ever proposed was probably the "thought photography" machine. He reasoned that a thought formed in the mind created a corresponding image in the retina, and the electrical data of this neural transmission could be read and recorded in a machine. The stored information could then be processed through an artificial [[optic nerve]] and played back as visual patterns on a viewscreen.

Another of Tesla's theorized inventions is commonly referred to as ''[[Tesla's Flying Machine]]'', which appears to resemble an [[ionocraft|ion-propelled aircraft]]. Tesla claimed that one of his life goals was to create a flying machine that would run without the use of an airplane engine, wings, [[ailerons]], [[propellers]], or an onboard fuel source. Initially, Tesla pondered about the idea of a flying craft that would fly using an electric motor powered by grounded base stations. As time progressed, Tesla suggested that perhaps such an aircraft could be run entirely electro-mechanically. The theorized appearance would typically take the form of a cigar or saucer.

===Personal life===
Tesla was fluent in many languages. Along with [[Serbian]], he spoke seven other languages: [[Czech language|Czech]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Latin]].

Tesla may have suffered from [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]],<ref>[http://www.kerryr.net/pioneers/tesla.htm Kerryr.net]</ref>
and had many unusual quirks and phobias. He did things in threes, and was adamant about staying in a hotel room with a number divisible by three. Tesla was also noted to be physically revolted by jewelry, notably pearl earrings. He was fastidious about cleanliness and hygiene, and was by all accounts [[mysophobia|mysophobic]]. He greatly disliked touching round objects as well as [[Hair|human hair]] other than his own.

Tesla was obsessed with pigeons, ordering special seeds for the pigeons he fed in [[Central Park]] and even bringing some into his hotel room with him. Tesla was an animal-lover, often reflecting contentedly about a childhood cat, "The Magnificent Macak". Tesla never married. He was [[celibacy|celibate]] and claimed that his chastity was very helpful to his scientific abilities.<ref name="cheney-79" />  Nonetheless there have been numerous accounts of women vying for Tesla's affection, even some madly in love with him. Tesla, though polite, behaved rather ambivalently to these women in the romantic sense.

Tesla was prone to alienating himself and was generally soft-spoken. However, when he did engage in a social life, many people spoke very positively and admiringly of him. Robert Underwood Johnson described him as attaining a "distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity, and force". His loyal secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, wrote: "his genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his soul". Tesla's friend Hawthorne wrote that "seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer who was also a poet, a philosopher, an appreciator of fine music, a linguist, and a connoisseur of food and drink".

Nevertheless, Tesla displayed the occasional cruel streak; he openly expressed his disgust for overweight people, once firing a secretary because of her weight.<ref name="cheney-79" />{{rp|110}} He was quick to criticize others' clothing as well, demanding a subordinate to go home and change her dress on several occasions.<ref name="cheney-79" /> 

Tesla was widely known for his great showmanship, presenting his innovations and demonstrations to the public as an artform, almost like a magician. This seems to conflict with his observed reclusiveness; Tesla was a complicated figure. He refused to hold conventions without his [[Tesla coil]] blasting electricity throughout the room, despite the audience often being terrified, though he assured them everything was perfectly safe.

[[Image:Twain in Tesla's Lab.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mark Twain]] in Tesla's lab, spring 1894]]

In middle age, Tesla became very close friends with [[Mark Twain]]. They spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere.

Tesla remained bitter in the aftermath of his incident with Edison. The day after Edison died the ''[[New York Times]]'' contained extensive coverage of Edison's life, with the only negative opinion coming from Tesla, who was quoted as saying: {{quote|He had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene &nbsp;... His method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 per cent of the labor. But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor's instinct and practical American sense.}} Shortly before he died, Edison said that his biggest mistake had been in trying to develop directed current, rather than the vastly superior alternating current system that Tesla had put within his grasp.<ref name="cheney-uth-glenn-99" />{{rp|19}}

Tesla was good friends with [[Robert Underwood Johnson]]. He had amicable relations with [[Francis Marion Crawford]], [[Stanford White]], Fritz Lowenstein, George Scherff, and Kenneth Swezey. Tesla made his first million at the age of forty, but gave away nearly all his royalties on future innovations. Tesla was rather financially inept, but he was almost entirely unconcerned with [[Wealth|material wealth]]. He ripped up a [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse]] contract that would have made him the world's first billionaire, in part because of the implications it would have on his future vision of free power, and in part because it would run Westinghouse out of business, and Tesla had no desire to deal with the creditors.

Tesla lived the last ten years of his life in a two-room suite on the 33rd floor of the [[Hotel New Yorker]], room 3327. There, near the end of his life, when Tesla was slipping into what many consider an altered [[Mental health|state of mind]], he would claim to be visited by a specific white pigeon daily. Several biographers note that Tesla viewed the death of the pigeon as a "final blow" to himself and his work.

Tesla believed that [[war]] could not be avoided until the cause for its recurrence was removed, but was opposed to wars in general.<ref>Secor, H. Winfield, "''[http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/.htm Tesla's views on Electricity and the War]''", Electrical Experimenter, Volume 5, Number 4, August, 1917.</ref>
He sought to reduce distance, such as in communication for better understanding, transportation, and transmission of energy, as a means to ensure friendly [[international relations]].<ref>"''[http://www.tesla.hu/tesla/articles/.doc Giant Eye to See Round the World]''" Albany Telegram, 25 February 1923 (doc).</ref>

Like many of his era, Tesla, a life-long bachelor, became a proponent of a self-imposed selective breeding version of [[eugenics]]. In a 1937 interview, he stated:
{{quote|... man's new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature. The only method compatible with our notions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct .... The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. A century from now it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal.<ref>Viereck, George Sylvester, and Nikola Tesla, "''[http://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art11.html A Machine to End War] - A Famous Inventor, Picturing Life 100 Years from Now, Reveals an Astounding Scientific Venture Which He Believes Will Change the Course of History''". Liberty, February 1937.</ref>}}
In 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward [[gender equality]], indicated that humanity's future would be run by "Queen Bees". He believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future.<ref>Kennedy, John B., "''[http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1926-01-30.htm When woman is boss], An interview with Nikola Tesla''". [[Collier's Weekly|Colliers]], 30 January 1926.</ref>

In his later years Tesla became a [[vegetarian]]. In an article for ''[[Century Illustrated Magazine]]'' he wrote: "It is certainly preferable to raise vegetables, and I think, therefore, that [[vegetarianism]] is a commendable departure from the established barbarous habit." Tesla argued that it is wrong to eat uneconomic meat when large numbers of people are starving; he also believed that plant food was "superior to it [meat] in regard to both mechanical and mental performance". He also argued that animal slaughter was "wanton and cruel".<ref>Nikola Tesla, "''[http://www.tfcbooks.com/TESLA/1900-06-00.htm The Problem of Increasing Human Energy]''". [[Century Illustrated Magazine]], June 1900.</ref>

In his final years he suffered from extreme sensitivity to light, sound and other influences.<ref>O'Neill, "Prodigal Genius" (extract at [http://www.electrosensitivity.org Electrosensitivity.org - Q&A])</ref>

====Death====
[[Image:Teslabust adjusted.jpg|thumb|Bust of Tesla by [[Ivan Me<U+0161>trovi<U+0107>]], 1952, in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]]]

Tesla died of [[heart failure]] alone in room 3327 of the [[New Yorker Hotel]], some time between the evening of 5 January and the morning of 8 January 1943, at the age of 86.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Nikola Tesla Dies. Prolific Inventor. Alternating Power Current's Developer Found Dead in Hotel Suite Here. Claimed a 'Death Beam'. He Insisted the Invention Could Annihilate an Army of 1,000,000 at Once. |url= |quote= |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=8 January 1943, Friday |accessdate= }}</ref> Despite having sold his AC electricity patents, Tesla was destitute and died with significant debts. Later that year the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] upheld Tesla's patent number,<ref>{{US patent|645,576}}</ref> in effect recognizing him as the inventor of radio.

Immediately after Tesla's death became known, the government's [[Alien Property Custodian]] office took possession of his papers and property, despite his [[United States nationality law|US citizenship]]. His safe at the hotel was also opened. At the time of his death, Tesla had been continuing his work on the [[teleforce]] weapon, or death ray, that he had unsuccessfully marketed to the US War Department. It appears that his proposed death ray was related to his research into [[ball lightning]] and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], and was imagined as a [[particle beam weapon]]. The US government did not find a prototype of the device in the safe. After the FBI was contacted by the War Department, his papers were declared to be [[Classified information|top secret]]. The so-called "peace ray" constitutes a part of some conspiracy theories as a means of destruction. The personal effects were seized on the advice of presidential advisers; [[J. Edgar Hoover]] declared the case most secret, because of the nature of Tesla's inventions and patents.<ref>Hoover, John Edgar, et al., [http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/tesla.htm FOIA FBI files], 1943.</ref>
One document states that "[he] is reported to have some 80&nbsp;trunks in different places containing transcripts and plans having to do with his experiments [...]". [[Charlotte Muzar]] reported that there were several "missing" papers and property.

Tesla's family and the Yugoslav embassy struggled with the American authorities to gain these items after his death due to the potential significance of some of his research. Eventually, his nephew, Sava Kosanovi<U+010B>, won possession of some of his personal effects, which are now housed in the [[Nikola Tesla Museum]] in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].<ref>[http://www.tesla-museum.org/ Nikola Tesla Museum]</ref>
Tesla's funeral took place on 12 January 1943, at the [[Cathedral of Saint John the Divine]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. His body was cremated and his ashes taken to [[Belgrade]], [[SFRJ|Yugoslavia]] in 1957. The urn was placed in the Nikola Tesla Museum, where it resides to this day.

==Legacy and honours==
[[Image:Tesla statue at niagara falls.jpg|thumb|200px|Statue of Nikola Tesla in [[Niagara Falls State Park]] on [[Goat Island (New York)|Goat Island, New York]]]]
Tesla did not like posing for portraits, doing so only once for princess [[Vilma Lwoff-Parlaghy]].<ref> The portrait survived in the collection of Ludwig Nissen, Brooklyn, see: Klaus Lengsfeld: Sammlung Ludwig Nissen : Husum 1855 - 1924 New York; Dokumentation d. Kunstsammlung Ludwig Nissens anl<U+00E4>ssl. d. Ausstellung zu seinem 125. Geburtstag im Nissenhaus zu Husum, 1980, 169&nbsp;Pages. (= Schriften des Nordfriesischen Museums Ludwig-Nissen-Haus, Nr. 16)</ref> His wish was to have a sculpture made by his close friend [[Ivan Me<U+0161>trovi<U+0107>]], who was at that time in United States, but he died before getting a chance to see it. Me<U+0161>trovi<U+0107> made a bronze bust (1952) that is held in the Nikola Tesla Museum in [[Belgrade]] and a statue (1955/56) placed at the [[Ru<U+0111>er Bo<U+0161>kovi<U+0107>]] Institute in [[Zagreb]]. This statue was moved to Nikola Tesla Street in Zagreb's city centre on the 150th anniversary of Tesla's birth, with the [[Ru<U+0111>er Bo<U+0161>kovi<U+0107> Institute]] to receive a duplicate.
In 1976, a bronze statue of Tesla was placed at [[Niagara Falls, New York]]. A similar statue was also erected in his hometown of Gospi<U+0107> in 1986.

The [[SI]] unit [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] (T) for measuring [[magnetic flux density]] or magnetic induction (commonly known as the [[magnetic field]] '''B''') was named in Tesla<U+2019>s honour at the ''Conf<U+00E9>rence G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale des Poids et Mesures'', [[Paris]] in 1960. The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) of which Tesla had been vice president also created an award in recognition of Tesla. Called the IEEE Nikola Tesla Award, it is given to individuals or a team that has made outstanding contributions to the generation or utilization of electric power, and is considered the most prestigious award in the area of electric power.<ref>IEEE, "''[http://www.ieee.org/portal/site/mainsite/menuitem.818c0c39e85ef176fb2275875bac26c8/index.jsp?&pName=corp_level1&path=about/awards/sums&file=tesla.xml&xsl=generic.xsl IEEE Nikola Tesla Award]''. 01 April 2005.</ref>
The [[Tesla (crater)|Tesla crater]] on the far side of the Moon and the [[minor planet]] [[2244 Tesla]] are also named after him.

[[Image:20CSD Coin Tesla.jpg|thumb|left|20 Serbian dinar coin minted in 2006]]

Tesla was featured on several [[Yugoslav dinar|Yugoslav-]] and [[Serbian dinar]] notes and coinage. The largest [[Power station|power plant]] complex in Serbia, the [[TPP Nikola Tesla]] is named in his honour. On 10 July 2006 the biggest airport in Serbia ([[Belgrade]]) was renamed [[Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport]] in honor of Tesla<U+2019>s 150th birthday.

[[Tesla (company)]] was a large, state-owned electrotechnical conglomerate in the former Czechoslovakia. It was renamed in Tesla's honour from previous Electra on 7 March 1946. Some of its subsidiaries still trade in Czech Republic.

An [[Battery electric vehicle|electric car]] company, [[Tesla Motors]], named their company in tribute to Tesla. Their website states: ''The namesake of our [[Tesla Roadster]] is the genius Nikola Tesla'' [...] ''We<U+2018>re confident that if he were alive today, Nikola Tesla would look over our car and nod his head with both understanding and approval.''<ref>[http://www.teslamotors.com/learn_more/why_tesla.php Why the Name "Tesla"?], [[Tesla Motors]], Inc., 2006</ref>

The Croatian subsidiary of [[Ericsson]] is also named '[[Ericsson Nikola Tesla]] d.d'. ('Nikola Tesla' was a phone hardware company in [[Zagreb]] before Ericsson bought it in the 1990s) in honour of Tesla's pioneering work in wireless communication.

The year 2006 was celebrated by [[UNESCO]] as the ''150th anniversary of the birth of Nikola Tesla, scientist )'', as well as being proclaimed by the governments of [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]] to be the ''Year of Tesla''. On this anniversary, 10 July 2006, the renovated village of Smiljan (which had been demolished during the wars of the 1990s) was opened to the public along with Tesla's house (as a memorial museum) and a new multimedia center dedicated to the life and work of Tesla. The [[Parish church|parochial church]] of St. Peter and Paul, where Tesla's father had held services, was renovated as well. The museum and multimedia center are filled with replicas of Tesla's work. The museum has collected almost all of the papers ever published by, and about, Tesla; most of these provided by Ljubo Vujovic from the Tesla Memorial Society.
in New York. Alongside Tesla's house, a monument created by sculptor [[Mile Blazevic]] has been erected. In the nearby city of Gospi<U+0107>, on the same date as the reopening of the renovated village and museums, a [[higher education]] school named Nikola Tesla was opened, and a replica of the statue of Tesla made by [[Frano Krsinic]] (the original is in [[Belgrade]]) was presented.

In the years after, many of his innovations, theories and claims have been used, at times unsuitably and controversially, to support various fringe theories that are regarded as unscientific. Most of Tesla's own work conformed with the principles and methods accepted by science, but his extravagant personality and sometimes unrealistic claims, combined with his unquestionable genius, have made him a popular figure among fringe theorists and believers in conspiracies about "[[Occult|hidden knowledge]]". Some conspiracy theorists even in his time believed that he was actually an angelic being from Venus sent to Earth to reveal scientific knowledge to humanity.<ref name="cheney-79" /> This belief is maintained in present times by followers of [[Nuwaubianism]].

===Monuments===
A monument to Tesla was established at Niagara Falls, New York, USA. This monument is a copy of a monument standing in front of the Belgrade University Faculty of Electrical Engineering.  Another monument to Tesla, featuring him standing on a portion of an alternator, was established at [[Queen Victoria Park]] in Niagara Falls, [[Ontario, Canada]].<ref>[http://www.teslasociety.com/les.htm Tesla Memorial Society of New York | Tesla Monument in Canada]</ref>  The monument was officially unveiled on Sunday, 9 July 2006 on the 150th anniversary of Tesla's birth. The monument was sponsored by St. George Serbian Church, [[Niagara Falls]], and designed by Les Drysdale of [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. Mr. Drysdale's design was the winning design from an international competition.  Tesla's most famous statue is the one erected on 23 May 1879 at Sycamore Peak showing him and Dr. Brian S. Whitecross. Belgrade International Airport is called "Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport".<ref>[http://www.airport-belgrade.co.yu link ]</ref>
