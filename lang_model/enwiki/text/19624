'''Roberto Clemente Walker''' ([[August 18]], [[1934]] &ndash; [[December 31]], [[1972]]) was a professional baseball player and a former [[Major League Baseball]] [[right fielder]]. Clemente was born in [[Carolina, Puerto Rico|Carolina]], [[Puerto Rico]], the youngest of seven children. On [[November 14]], [[1964]], he married Vera Zabala at San Fernando Church in Carolina. The couple had three children: Roberto Jr., Luis Roberto and Enrique Roberto. He began his professional career playing with the [[Santurce Crabbers (baseball)|Santurce Crabbers]] in the [[Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League]] (LBBPR). While he was playing in Puerto Rico, the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] offered him a contract to play with the [[Montreal Royals]]. Clemente accepted the offer and was active with the team until he was drafted by the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the Major League Baseball draft that took place on [[November 22]], [[1954]].

Clemente played eighteen seasons in Major League Baseball from [[1955 in sports|1955]] to [[1972 in sports|1972]], all with Pittsburgh. He was awarded the [[National League]]<U+2019>s [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] in 1966. During the course of his career, Clemente was selected to participate in the league's All Star Game on twelve occasions. He won twelve [[Gold Glove Awards]] and led the league in scoring during four different seasons. He was involved in charity work both in Puerto Rico and other Latin American countries, often delivering baseball equipment and food to them. He died in an [[Aviation accidents and incidents|aviation accident]] on [[December 31]], [[1972]], while en route to deliver aid to earthquake victims in [[Nicaragua]]. His [[body]] was never recovered.  He was elected to the [[United States Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] posthumously in [[1973 in sports|1973]], thus becoming the first Latin American to be selected and the and the only current Hall of Famer whose mandatory five year waiting period was waived since it was instituted in [[1954 in sports|1954]].

==Early life==
Roberto was born in [[Carolina, Puerto Rico]], to Melchor Clemente and Luisa Walker. He was the youngest of seven siblings, having five brothers and one sister. During his childhood, Don Melchor worked as foreman of the sugar crops located in the municipality.<ref>{{cite book|quote=Roberto<U+2019>s father, Don Melchor Clemente, worked as foreman in the sugar fields.|author=Paul Rober Walker |title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente |year=1988 |publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company |location=United States |language=English |isbn= 0-15-307557-0|pages=3 |chapter=The way of the Jibaro}}</ref>  The family<U+2019>s resources were limited and Roberto had to work to earn money; this work included delivering milk cans to the family<U+2019>s neighbors. Clemente demonstrated interest in baseball early in his life and would often play against neighboring [[barrio]]s. He studied in Vizcarondo High School, a public school located in Carolina. During his first year in high school, he was recruited by Roberto Marin to play [[softball]] with the Sello Rojo team; Marin had taken interest in Clemente when he saw him playing baseball in Barrio San Anton.<ref>{{cite book|quote=For the next two years, Roberto played for the Sello Rojo softball team.|author=Paul Rober Walker |title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente |year=1988 |publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company |location=United States |language=English |isbn= 0-15-307557-0|pages=20 |chapter=Where Are You Going, Momen?}}</ref>  He was with the team two years, playing shortstop. Clemente joined Puerto Rico<U+2019>s amateur league when he was sixteen years old; while there, he played for the Ferdinand Juncos team, which represented the municipality of [[Juncos, Puerto Rico|Juncos]].<ref>{{cite book|quote=When he was sixteen, he played for the Ferdinand Juncos team in the Puerto Rican amateur league.|author=Paul Rober Walker |title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente |year=1988 |publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company |location=United States |language=English |isbn= 0-15-307557-0|pages=20 |chapter=Where Are You Going, Momen?}}</ref>

== Baseball career==
Clemente<U+2019>s professional career began when Pedr<U+00ED>n Zorilla offered him a contract with the [[Santurce Crabbers (baseball)|Santurce Crabbers]] of the [[Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League|LBBPR]].<ref>{{cite book|quote=<U+201C>Well, Marin,<U+201D> said se<U+00F1>or Zorilla, <U+201C>we can give him $400 bonus and maybe $ 40.00 a week until he learns to wear a uniform.<U+201D> |author=Paul Rober Walker |title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente |year=1988 |publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company |location=United States |language=English |isbn= 0-15-307557-0|pages=25 |chapter=Tell the Man I Will Sign}}</ref>  He was a bench player during his first campaign, but was promoted to the team<U+2019>s starting lineup the following season. During this season he hit .288 as the team<U+2019>s leadoff hitter. While Clemente was playing in the LBBPR, the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] offered him a contract with the team<U+2019>s [[Triple-A]] subsidiary.<ref>{{cite book|quote=<U+201C>Roberto,<U+201D> said Pedrin Zorilla, <U+201C>I have spoken with Mr. Campanis.

The climate and language differences affected Clemente early on, but he received the assistance of his teammate Joe Black, who was able to speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. In 1954, Clyde Sukeforth, a scout for the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], noticed that Clemente was being used as a bench player for the team and discussed the possibility of drafting Clemente to the Pirates with the team<U+2019>s manager Max Macon.<ref>{{cite book|quote=<U+201C>I noticed you haven<U+2019>t been playing Clemente much.<U+201D> Sukeforth smiled across the dinner table at Max Macon.

==Pittsburgh Pirates==
Clemente debuted with the Pittsburgh Pirates on [[April 17]], [[1955]] in the first of a double header against the Brooklyn Dodgers.<ref>{{cite book| quote=It was Sunday, April 17, 1955, and the Pittsburgh Pirates were playing the first game of a double-header against the Brooklyn Dodgers.[...] For Roberto Clemente it was his first time at bat in the major leagues.|author=Paul Rober Walker |title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente |year=1988 |publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company |location=United States |language= |isbn= 0-15-307557-0|pages= |chapter=I play like Roberto Clemente}}</ref> At the beginning of his time with the Pirates, he experienced frustration because of racial tension between himself, the local media, and even some of his teammates.<ref>{{cite book|quote=Even on his own team, some of the players made fun of him and called him a <U+201C>nigger.<U+201D> Roberto grew furious at their insults.|author=Paul Rober Walker |title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente |year=1988 |publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company |location=United States |language= |isbn= 0-15-307557-0|pages= |chapter=I play like Roberto Clemente}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| quote=There were other insults as well.

During the middle of the season, Clemente was involved in a car accident; this caused him to miss several games with an injury in his lower back.<ref>{{cite book| quote=To make matters worse, Roberto had to sit out many games because of pain in his lower back.

He finished his rookie season with an [[Batting average|average]] of .255, despite confronting trouble hitting certain types of pitches.<ref>{{cite book| quote=Roberto continued to struggle at the plate through-out his rookie season, finally finishing with a .255 average.|author=Paul Rober Walker |title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente |year=1988 |publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company |location=United States |language= |isbn= 0-15-307557-0|pages= |chapter=I play like Roberto Clemente}}</ref> His defensive skills, however, were highlighted during this season.<ref>{{cite book| quote=In the outfield, however, he quickly established himself as a outstanding performer.|author=Paul Rober Walker |title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente |year=1988 |publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company |location=United States |language= |isbn= 0-15-307557-0|pages= |chapter=I play like Roberto Clemente}}</ref>
						
During the off season, Clemente played with the Santurce Crabbers in the Puerto Rican baseball winter league, where he was already considered a star.<ref>{{cite book| quote=Once again he was playing for the Santurce Crabbers.

===The 1960s===
The Pirates experienced several difficult seasons through the 1950s, although they did manage their first winning season since [[1948 in sports|1948]] in 1959. During the winter season of 1958-59, Clemente didn't play winter baseball in Puerto Rico; instead, he served in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserves]]. He spent six months in his  military commitment at [[Parris Island]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Camp LeJeune]] in [[North Carolina]]. In Camp Lejeune, he served as an [[infantryman]]. The rigorous training program helped Clemente physically. He added strength by gaining ten pounds and said his back troubles had disappeared. 

He remained in the reserves until September of 1964.<ref>{{cite book| title=Clemente to Start Six-Month Marine Corps Hitch, Oct. 4,| publisher=The Sporting News| date=September 24, 1958| pages=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=Buc Flyhawk Now Marine Rookie| publisher=The Sporting News| date=November 19, 1958| pages=13}}</ref><ref name="Marine">{{cite web| url=http://www.usmc-mccs.org/sports/hof/2003-clemente.cfm| title=Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame: Roberto Clemente| accessdate=2007-12-17}}</ref> Early in the [[1960 in sports|1960]] season, Clemente led the league, batting an average of .353 and scoring [[Run batted in|Runs Batted In]] (RBIs) in twenty-five out of twenty-seven games.<ref>{{cite book|quote=In May, while the Pirates were fighting the San Fransisco Giants for first place, Roberto drove in 25 runs in 27 games.

In August, he was inactive for five games as a result of a injury on his chin; he received this injury when his head impacted a concrete wall while he was trying to catch a hard line hit that reached the park's outer wall. Following this accident, he was transported to a local hospital, where the doctors stitched his chin; this prohibited him from playing until the injury was healed.<ref>{{cite book|quote=Roberto was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. The doctors stitched up his jaw and he sat out the next five games waiting for it to heal|author=Paul Rober Walker |title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente |year=1988 |publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company |location=United States |language=English |isbn= 0-15-307557-0|pages=64 |chapter=Beat 'Em, Bucs!}}</ref> The Pirates compiled a 95-59 record during the regular season, winning the National League pennant, and defeated the [[New York Yankees]] in a seven-game [[1960 World Series|World Series]].

During the 1961 spring training, Clemente tried to modify his batting technique by using a heavier bat in order to slow the speed of his swing, following advice from Pirates' batting coach [[George Sisler]].<ref>{{cite book|quote=Now, in the spring of 1961, he made another improvement. He began using a heavier bat to slow down his swing and make better contact with the ball.|author=Paul Rober Walker |title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente |year=1988 |publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company |location=United States |language=English |isbn= 0-15-307557-0|pages=74 |chapter=Beat 'Em, Bucs!}}</ref> During the 1961 season, Clemente was selected as the starting right fielder for the National League in the All-Star game. In this game, he batted a triple on his first at-bat and scored the team's first run. With the American League ahead 4-3 in the tenth inning, Clemente hit a double that gave the National League a decisive 5-4 win.<ref>{{cite book|quote=Then he brought his bat around and smashed a line drive to right field.

Following the season, he traveled to Puerto Rico along with [[Orlando Cepeda]], who was a native of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]]. When both players arrived, they were received by 18,000 people, who were celebrating that this was the first season in which both leagues in Major League Baseball were led in batting average by Puerto Rican players.<ref>{{cite book|quote=When the plane landed, Roberto and Cepeda received a hero's welcome.

During the course of the winter league, Clemente was injured and only participated as a pinch hitter in the league's All-Star game.  He experienced a complication on his injury during the course of this game and underwent surgery shortly after being carried off of the playing field.<ref>{{cite book|quote=The injury had not affected his swing, and he smashed a hard line drive to right field. But as he limped to first base, his leg collapsed beneath him. He was rushed to the hospital, and a few days later, the doctors cut open his leg to drain a pool of blood in his thigh.|author=Paul Rober Walker |title=Pride of Puerto Rico: The life of Roberto Clemente |year=1988 |publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company |location=United States |language=English |isbn= 0-15-307557-0|pages=85 |chapter=It Is My Life}}</ref> 

This condition limited his role with the Pirates in the first half of the 1965 season, during which he batted an average of .257. He was inactive for several games during this stage of the campaign before being fully active; when he returned to the starting lineup, he hit in thirty-three out of thirty-four games and his average improved to .340.<ref>{{cite book|quote=Clemente was back and so were the Pirates.

===The 1970s===
The 1970 season was the last one that the Pittsburgh Pirates played in [[Forbes Field]] before moving to [[Three Rivers Stadium]]; for Clemente, abandoning this stadium was a emotional situation. The Pirates' final game at Forbes Field took place on [[June 28]], [[1970]]. That day, Clemente noted that it was hard to play in a different field, saying, "I spent half my life there".<ref>{{cite book|quote=On June 28, 1970, the Pittsburgh Pirates played their last game at Forbes Field.

During the 1970 campaign, Clemente compiled an average of .352; the Pirates won the [[National League East]] but were subsequently eliminated by the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. In the offseason, Clemente experienced some tense situations while he was working as manager of the Senators and when his father, Melchor Clemente, experienced medical problems and was subjected to a surgery.<ref>{{cite book|quote=That winter, Roberto had other concerns as well.

In the 1971 season, the Pirates won the National League and faced the Baltimore Orioles in the [[1971 World Series|World Series]]. Baltimore had won 100 games and swept the [[American League Championship Series]], both for the third consecutive year, and were the defending World Series champions. The Orioles won the first two games in the series, but Pittsburgh won the championship in seven games. This marked the second occasion that Clemente had won a World Series with the Pirates. Over the course of the series, Clemente batted a .414 average (12 hits in 29 [[at bat|at-bats]]), performed well defensively, and scored a solo home run in the deciding 2-1 seventh game victory.<ref name="ESPN 2"/> Following the conclusion of the season, he received the World Series Most Valuable Player award.

Clemente spent much of his time during the off-season involved in charity work. When [[Managua]], the capital city of [[Nicaragua]], was affected by a massive earthquake on [[December 23]], [[1972]], Clemente (who had been visiting Managua three weeks before the quake) immediately set to work arranging emergency relief flights.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/kids/dreamteam/robertoclemente.html| title=White House Dream Team: Roberto Walker Clemente| publisher=White House| accessdate=2007-12-09}}</ref> He soon learned, however, that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt officials of the [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle|Somoza]] government, never reaching victims of the quake.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://archivo.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2004/diciembre/11-diciembre-2004/nacional/nacional-20041211-15.html| title=El vuelo solidario y temerario de Clemente| publisher=El Nuevo Diario| accessdate=2007-12-09}}</ref> 

Clemente decided to accompany the fourth relief flight, hoping that his presence would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors.<ref name=Gale">{{cite web| url=http://www.galegroup.com/free_resources/chh/bio/clemente_r.htm| title=Hispanic Heritage: Roberto Clemente| publisher=Gale Gengage Learning| accessdate=2007-12-09}}</ref> The airplane he chartered for a New Year's Eve flight had a history of mechanical problems and sub-par flight personnel, and it was overloaded by 5,000 pounds. It crashed into the ocean off the coast of [[Isla Verde, Puerto Rico]] immediately after takeoff on [[December 31]], [[1972]].<ref name="Latino Legends">{{cite web| url=http://www.latinosportslegends.com/clemente.htm| title=Roberto Clemente| publisher=Latino Legends in Sports| accessdate=2007-12-09}}</ref> A few days after the crash, the body of the pilot and part of the fuselage of the plane were found. An empty flight case apparently belonging to Clemente was the only personal item recovered from the plane. Teammate [[Manny Sanguillen]], a catcher and Clemente's best friend, was the only member of the Pirates not to attend Roberto's funeral.  He chose instead to dive into the waters where Clemente's plane had crashed in an effort to find his teammate.  Clemente's body was never recovered.<ref name="Latino Legends"/>

At the time of his death, Clemente had established several records within the Pittsburgh Pirates, including pocessing the record for most triples scored in a single game with three and the record for most hits in two consecutive games with ten. <ref>{{cite web| url=http://pittsburgh.pirates.mlb.com/pit/history/single_game_records.jsp| title=Pirates Single Game Records| publisher=Piittsburgh Pirates| accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref> As well as achieving other accomplishments that were unparalleled at the moment. These include tying the record for most [[Gold Glove Award]]s won among outfielders with twelve, which he shares with [[Willie Mays]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://baseball-almanac.com/awards/aw_ggnl.shtml| title=Gold Glove National League Outfielders| publisher=Baseball Almanac| accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref>  He also became the only player to have ever scored a [[Walk-off home run|walk-off]] [[Home run#Inside-the-park home run|inside-the-park]] [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://leftfield.homestead.com/roberto_clemente.html| title=Roberto Clemente Presente!| publisher=leftfield.com|accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref> In addition, he was one of four players to have ten or more Gold Gloves and a lifetime batting average of over .300.
