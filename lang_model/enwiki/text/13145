The '''Thunderbird Motel''' is an [[Native_Americans_in_the_United_States|Indian]]-themed motel that was built in 1962 along [[Interstate 494]] and 24th Ave. in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]], a suburb of [[Minneapolis]]. It is an example of [[post-war]] [[Americana]]. The hotel is a part of the [[Ramada]] franchise.

==History==
The motel was built at a time of rapid expansion in this area of south [[metropolitan]] Minneapolis. Interstate 494 had just been put in, and the area was growing. With the construction of 
[[Metropolitan Stadium]] in 1955, and the moving of the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]] to [[Minnesota]] by [[Calvin Griffith]] in 1961, the motel was primed to handle [[city]] business, [[airport]] travelers, and [[suburban]] business.
In late 2005, the hotel was purchased

==Early competition==
The motel competed primarily with the [[Holiday Inn]], with its famous [[Great Sign]], which was erected in 1961 at the intersection of Interstate 494 and 34th Ave. S, one mile east of the Thunderbird. It stands to this day, although significantly altered.

The Thunderbird also competed with the [[Howard Johnson's|Howard Johnson]] motel and restaurant, which was the first of its kind in [[Minnesota]], built in 1963 at the corner of Interstate 494 and [[Highway 100 (Minnesota)|Mn 100]], five miles west of the Thunderbird. It, unfortunately, was demolished in the year 2000.

==Exterior==
The exterior of the Thunderbird is notable for its post-war architecture, including [[faux]] stone, tall white columns, and colorful [[brick]]. The exterior features several examples of the Thunderbird logo, most notable on its famous sign, which has stood since its opening. It features two arrows criss-crossing the sign, with the logo at the top and the marquee below. Standing adjacent to the sign and just as tall is a [[synthetic]] [[totem pole]], with many characters and levels. Both signs stand facing Interstate 494. The exterior also featured a giant fiberglass statue of an Indian, hand raised in salute. There is also a smaller metallic Indian statue and a cannon. The grounds of the motel also have a unique outdoor [[swimming pool|pool]] featuring the motel logo; it is surrounded by the motel. Both statues  were removed in the early spring of 2006, and as of November 2006 the exterior signs now bear the Mall of America logo in place of the old Thunderbird logo.

==Interior==
The inside of the motel features many common architectural trends of the 1960s, with a [[suspended ceiling]], can lighting, and faux stone. The motel features numerous genuine and artificial Indian artifacts, and unique light fixtures that look like [[teepee]]s but actually act as lights. The many artifacts include a stuffed [[wolf]], [[tomahawk]]s, and [[pictures]]. The motel has many amenities, such as the Bow and Arrow Coffee Shop, the Totem Pole Dining Room, and the Pow-Wow Cocktail Lounge, as well as an indoor pool.

The [[motel]] also features "The Hall of Tribes", a mini-museum in the motel with rooms of the museum dedicated to different tribes. Some [[tribe]]s represented include the [[Winnebago]], the [[Miami]], and the [[Dakota]].

==Convention Center==
The Thunderbird features a 32,000 sq. ft. convention center which includes three large halls which at times can be divided into smaller rooms by the way of automatic and manual airwalls. Each of the individual rooms are named after Native American tribes. For example, the largest room ("Hall of Tribes") includes rooms named [[Chippewa]], [[Ojibwa|Cherokee]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Pawnee]]. Another banquet hall can be divided into the "East [[Menominee|Menomonie]]", "West Menomonie" and [[Miami tribe|Miami]] rooms (the combination of which makes up "The 3 'M's"). The third banquet hall can be split into three rooms named [[Shoshone]], [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] and [[Yakama|Yakima]].

==As a historic landmark==
The Thunderbird represents a carefree time after the war, when young families were in search of fun and entertainment. The Thunderbird is an example of a [[retro]], independently owned motel that featured the amenities expected at the time and has carried on to the present day with few changes to the feel of the motel.

==Trivia==
*According to the 1964 [[Minnesota Twins]] program, the Thunderbird Motel is "Just a Homerun From [[Metropolitan Stadium]]", and featured Dick Clausen at the [[piano]] and [[organ (music)|organ]].
