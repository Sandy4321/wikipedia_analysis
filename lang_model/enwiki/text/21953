'''''Ready''''' is the third [[studio album]] by American [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Trey Songz]]. The album, his first studio release since 2007's ''[[Trey Day]]'', was released by Songbook and [[Atlantic Records]] on August 31, 2009 in the United States. Production for the album began in 2008 and continued until 2009, featuring contributions from Songz's mentor [[Troy Taylor (producer)|Troy Taylor]], [[Bryan-Michael Cox]], [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]], and [[Los Da Mystro]], among others. 

The album received generally positive reviews from critics. Reviews positively compared ''Ready'' to the work of [[R. Kelly]], but criticized the album's inconsistency. It debuted at number three on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and peaked at number two on the U.S. [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart, selling 131,000 copies in its first week. The album was later certified [[RIAA certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), becoming Songz's first certified album.

Five singles released from ''Ready'' achieved chart success, including the top ten [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] hit "[[Say Aah]]", and the top five [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] hits "[[Neighbors Know My Name]]" and "[[I Invented Sex]]", the latter of which topped the chart. Songz promoted ''Ready'' in a number of live appearances, including co-heading the 106 & Live tour, sponsored by ''[[106 & Park]]'', and serving as a support act on [[Jay-Z]]'s [[The Blueprint 3 Tour]]. ''Ready'' earned Songz a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Best Contemporary R&B Album]] at the [[52nd Grammy Awards]]; however, it lost to [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]]' ''[[I Am...Sasha Fierce]]''.

==Production and development==
When Songz began recording for ''Ready'', the purpose of the album was to crossover and increase his exposure on radio. The album's lead single, "I Need a Girl", was released to connect to mainstream radio. Songz said that "[it] was a very radio-geared record which would do great and play on radio heavily during whatever time. It wasn't a record I expected to last forever, or one I was even excited about singing, but it was a record I knew would do well." Speaking of the following singles, Songz thought that "I Invented Sex" would be a "career-defining record, and I knew 'Say Aah' would be a monster club record."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.expressnightout.com/content/2010/09/trey-songz-monica-passion-pain-pleasure-dar-constitution-hall.php |title=Songz For Hot Summer Nightz: Trey Songz, ''Passion, Pain & Pleasure,'' at DAR Constitution Hall |author=Hadadi, Roxana |date=2010-09-02 |work=[[Express (newspaper)|Express]] |accessdate=2010-09-05}} </ref>

Speaking on his collaborations with the producers, Songz said that on ''Ready'', "we're breaking down every song, every hook, every chorus, every bridge, and we're making sure every song is the best song it could be. This album isn't just going to be a compilation of songs, but a classic body of work."<ref name="Billboardfeature">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/#/news/trey-songz-ready-to-grow-up-on-third-album-1003999310.story|title=Trey Songz 'Ready' To Grow Up On Third Album|first=Mariel|last=Concepcion|date=2009-07-31|accessdate=2010-07-04|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.}}</ref> The album originally contained three guest features, [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]], [[Gucci Mane]] and [[Soulja Boy Tell 'Em]].<ref name="Billboardfeature"/> Songz wanted to keep the amount of features very limited, and stated that "anybody else I add is going to be very special".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagodefender.com/article-4614-singer-trey-songz-is-ready-to-get-back-to-business.html |title=Singer Trey Songz is 'Ready' to get back to business |author=Vaughn, Shamontiel L. |date=2009-05-22 |work=[[Chicago Defender]] |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> [[Fabolous]] was later added as a guest feature on "Say Aah".

Songz said that compared to his previous albums, "this album is very adult, very easygoing and very sexy [...] My first album was very adult-like, but in a different, more soulful, sample-driven kind of way, and my second one was more contemporary and trendy." To reflect his transition into adulthood and the changes in his music, Songz changed his appearance by cutting of his trademark braids.<ref name="Billboardfeature"/> Songz also began dressing in more sophisticated attire, trading in sneakers and T-shirts for vests, tailored pants, and "tasteful" shoes.<ref name="Aparticle"/> On the appearance change, Songz's mentor, producer, and the head of Songbook Entertainment, [[Troy Taylor (producer)|Troy Taylor]] said, "Trey's from the streets, he's a [[Ghetto|hood]] kid. He wasn't glamorous and (didn't have) the finer things in life growing up, [...] He didn't want to lose his [[Credibility|street-ism]], [...] As he grew into it I think he began to realize, 'Wait a minute, this ain't that bad after all,' and then he got the ladies' opinions."<ref name="Aparticle">{{cite web|url=http://www.treysongz.com/news/ap-rb-crooner-trey-songz-is-ready-for-the-world/|title=AP: R&B crooner Trey Songz is ready for the world|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[Atlantic Records]]/Trey Songz.com|accessdate=2010-07-04|date=2010-01-22}}</ref>

The album was originally set to be released on June 30, 2009; however, Songz delayed the date to September 1, 2009 so that he could return to the studio and finish the album. The release date was then moved up one day to August 31, 2009, in order for the album's work to be considered for the [[2010 Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treysongz.com/news/trey-songz-interview-with-gowherehiphopcom/|title=Trey Songz Interview With GoWhereHipHop.com|date=2009-08-27|accessdate=2010-07-05|publisher=TreySongz.com, [[Atlantic Records]]}}</ref>

After ''Ready''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s success, Songz explained that the album was a result of his growth and new-found maturity.<ref name="Definitive">{{cite web|url=http://www.singersroom.com/news/5451/Trey-Songz-Calls-Ready-Definitive-Album|title=Trey Songz Calls Ready 'Definitive' Album|publisher=Singersroom|date=2010-03-07|accessdate=2010-07-05}}</ref> Commenting about the success of his singles, Songz stated that "they're very strong records and they're not just radio records. They're records that embody the person I am as well as the artist I am. I think they're more definitive of who I am than any other album I've had. I've grown as an artist. I've been doing this for awhile now. As I've matured, I've learned how to exude that of which I want to be felt. I've learned what my fans want from me and things of that nature."<ref name="Definitive"/>

Despite viewing it imperfect and noting Songz had not mastered the balancing act "between being a horny boy and ladies' man", Mark Edward Nero of [[About.com]] said it was the best album of Songz's career, commenting, "Trey takes a big step toward establishing himself as an A-list singer."<ref name="Aboutreview"/> Nero also commended consistent vocals as a plus, and complimented the eclecticity of the songs, saying no tracks are unlistenable.<ref name="Aboutreview"/> Tyler Lewis of [[PopMatters]] said that Songz continued his tradition of inconsistent albums, commenting that the album's best is when it departs from the [[R.
