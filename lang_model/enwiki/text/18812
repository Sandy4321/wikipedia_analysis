'''Dane Charles Iorg''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|<U+0254>r|d<U+0292>}} {{respell|ORJ|'}}; born May 11, 1950 in [[Eureka, California]]) is a retired [[Major League Baseball]] [[infielder]] and [[outfielder]]. He played for ten seasons (1977<U+2013>1986) for four teams, including eight seasons for the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Iorg earned the game-winning hit in game six of the 1985 World Series. His brother [[Garth Iorg|Garth]] also played in the major leagues.

==Career==
Iorg debuted with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in April 1977, but by that June the club traded him along with outfielder [[Rick Bosetti]] and pitcher [[Tom Underwood]] to the St. Louis Cardinals for outfielder [[Bake McBride]] and pitcher Steve Waterbury.

During the strike-shortened 1981 season, he led the Cardinals in [[Run batted in|RBIs]] with 61 and with a .327 batting-average.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Jim Tommey and Kip Ingle|year=1987|title=St. Louis Cardinals 1987 Media Guide|publisher=St. Louis National Baseball Club|pages=153}}</ref> He is the brother of former third basemen [[Garth Iorg]]; both graduated from Arcata High School in [[Arcata, California]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/i/iorgda01.shtml|title=Dane Iorg|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> and they played against each other in the [[1985 American League Championship Series]].

In the [[1982 World Series]], Iorg played for the Cardinals, primarily as their World Series [[designated hitter]] (the entire 1982 World Series was played under American League rules) and batted .529 with 9 hits in 17 at-bats as the Cardinals defeated the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] in seven games. On July 15, 1984, the Cardinals sold Iorg to the [[Kansas City Royals]].

Iorg is perhaps best known for his game-winning hit in game 6 of the [[1985 World Series]] as a member of the [[Kansas City Royals]] against his old team, St. Louis. The hit came during one of only two at-bats that Iorg received during the series. The Cardinals had led the series three games to two prior to game six; the game is remembered for first-base umpire [[Don Denkinger]]'s controversial "safe" call of Royals hitter [[Jorge Orta]] on a ground ball to lead off the bottom of the ninth. Iorg batted later in the inning with one out and the bases loaded. The Royals trailed, 1<U+2013>0, until Iorg's single allowed [[Onix Concepci<U+00F3>n]] and [[Jim Sundberg]] to score. The Royals went on to win game 7, 11<U+2013>0, and give Kansas City their only [[1985 World Series|World Series]] championship.
