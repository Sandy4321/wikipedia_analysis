'''Joe Logan Diffie''' (born December 28, 1958 in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]) is an American [[country music]] singer known for his ballads and [[novelty song]]s. Between 1990 and 2004, Diffie charted thirty-five cuts on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, including five number one singles: his debut release "[[Home (Joe Diffie song)|Home]]", "[[If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets)]]", "[[Third Rock from the Sun (song)|Third Rock from the Sun]]", "[[Pickup Man]]" (his longest-lasting number one, at four weeks) and "[[Bigger Than the Beatles]]". In addition to these cuts, he has twelve other top ten singles and ten other top 40 hits on the same chart. He also co-wrote singles for [[Holly Dunn]], [[Tim McGraw]] and [[Jo Dee Messina]].

Diffie recorded for [[Epic Records]] from 1990 to 2000, releasing seven studio albums, a Christmas album and a greatest hits package under the Epic label. He also released one studio album each through [[Monument Records]], [[Broken Bow Records]] and [[Rounder Records]]. Among his albums, 1993's ''[[Honky Tonk Attitude]]'' and 1994's ''[[Third Rock from the Sun]]'' are [[music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]; 1992's ''[[Regular Joe]]'' and 1996's ''[[Life's So Funny]]'' are both certified gold. His most recent album, ''[[Homecoming: The Bluegrass Album]]'', was released in late 2010 through Rounder.

==Early life==
Joe Diffie was born into a musical family in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in 1958.<ref name="allmusic"/> His first musical performance came at age four, when he performed in his aunt's [[country music]] band.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1589|pure_url=yes}} |title=Joe Diffie biography |accessdate=19 July 2010 |last=Huey |first=Steve |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Diffie's father played guitar and banjo, and his mother sang. Following in his mother's footsteps, Diffie began to sing at an early age, often listening to the albums in his father's record collection. Diffie has said that his "Mom and Dad claimed that [he] could sing harmony when [he] was three years old."<ref name="stambler">{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Irwin|last2=Landon|first2=Grelun|title=Country Music: The Encyclopedia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d18K8QWcEo8C&pg=PA133&dq=%22joe+diffie%22&hl=en&ei=wwVFTKb4CpSInQfIgMG8Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=%22joe%20diffie%22&f=false|year=2000|publisher=MacMillan|pages=133<U+2013>135}}</ref> His family moved to [[San Antonio, Texas]] while he was in the first grade, and subsequently to [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington state]] where he attended fourth and fifth grades. Later, he moved to [[Wisconsin]] for the years he was in sixth grade through his second year of high school, and back to Oklahoma where he attended high school in the town of [[Velma, Oklahoma|Velma]]. In his last two years in high school, Diffie played football, baseball and golf in addition to running track; in his senior year he was recognized as Best All-Around Male Athlete.<ref name="stambler" />

After graduating, he attended [[Cameron University]] in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]]. Although he initially earned credits toward medical school, he decided against a medical profession after marrying for the first time in 1977, and ultimately dropped out before graduation.<ref name="stambler" /> Diffie first worked in oil fields, then drove a truck that pumped cement out of oil wells in [[Alice, Texas]], before he moved back to Duncan to work in a [[foundry]]. During this period, he worked as a musician on the side, first in a gospel group called Higher Purpose, and then in a bluegrass band called Special Edition.<ref name="stambler" /> Diffie then built a recording studio, began touring with Special Edition in adjacent states, and sent [[demo (music)|demo]] recordings to publishers in [[Nashville]]. [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]] recorded Diffie's "Love on the Rocks", and [[Randy Travis]] put one of Diffie's songs on hold but ultimately did not record it.<ref name="allmusic" /><ref name="stambler" />

After the foundry closed, Diffie declared bankruptcy and sold the studio out of financial necessity. He also divorced his wife, who left with their two children. Diffie spent several months in a state of depression before deciding to move to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name="stambler"/> There, he took a job at [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7ccdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tVgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4695,2267203&dq=joe-diffie&hl=en|title=Diffie Turns Lost Job into New Career|date=13 January 1991|work=[[The Victoria Advocate]]|accessdate=20 July 2010}}</ref> While at Gibson, he contacted a songwriter and recorded more demos, including songs that would later be recorded by [[Ricky Van Shelton]], [[Billy Dean]], [[Alabama (band)|Alabama]], [[Triumph (band)|Triumph]] and [[The Forester Sisters]].<ref name="opry">{{cite web|url=http://www.opry.com/artists/d/Diffie_Joe.html|title=Opry Member: Joe Diffie|work=Opry.com|accessdate=27 July 2010}}</ref> By mid-1989, he quit working at the company in order to record demos full-time. Diffie also met Debbie, who would later become his second wife. That same year, Diffie was contacted by Bob Montgomery, then vice president of [[A&R]] at [[Epic Records]], who said that he wanted to sign Diffie to a contract with the label, but had to put the singer on hold for a year.<ref name="stambler" /> In the meantime, [[Holly Dunn]] released "[[There Goes My Heart Again]]", which Diffie co-wrote and sang the backing vocals.<ref name="allmusic" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UDkgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5WMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7060,6118723&dq=joe-diffie&hl=en|title=Joe Diffie's Loss Was Joe Diffie's Gain|last=Sharpe|first=Jerry|date=24 November 1990|work=[[The Pittsburgh Press]]|accessdate=20 July 2010}}</ref> Following this song's chart success, Diffie signed with Epic in early 1990.<ref name="whitburn" />

The first was a Christmas project titled ''[[Mr. Christmas (album)|Mr. Christmas]]'', which comprised covers of traditional Christmas songs as well as newly-written songs. One of these original songs, "LeRoy the Redneck Reindeer", was issued as a Christmas single late in the year, peaking at number 33 upon its initial release and re-entering the country music charts for the next two years based on Christmas airplay.<ref name="whitburn" /> Of this album, [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] said, "it's pleasant, but it's not particularly distinguished."<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r229321|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Mr. Christmas'' review|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|work=Allmusic|accessdate=20 July 2010}}</ref>

This move was due to a corporate decision that Epic had too many artists and Monument had too few.<ref name="diffieworld">{{cite journal|last=Waddell|first=Ray|date=27 October 2001|title=Diffie's 'World' View on Monument|journal=Billboard|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kBEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA13&dq=%22joe+diffie%22&hl=en&ei=zwFFTMePKKDhnQeTyq2_Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22joe%20diffie%22&f=false}}</ref> Cook and Wilson also produced his only album for Monument, which was titled ''[[In Another World]]''. Regarding this album, Diffie told ''Billboard'' that its material had a common theme of love, and that he wanted to create a more contemporary sound through the production.<ref name="diffieworld" /> The album's [[In Another World (song)|title track]] peaked at number ten on the country charts and number 66 on the Hot 100. Only one other single was released from the album: "This Pretender" (co-written by [[Rascal Flatts]] lead singer [[Gary LeVox]]), which failed to make the country music Top 40.<ref name="whitburn" />

''In Another World'' received mixed reviews. ''[[Country Weekly]]'' reviewer wrote that Diffie "deals with adult emotions" and described the title track as "a shimmering ballad perfect for his expressive tenor."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.countryweekly.com/reviews/85|title=''In Another World'' review|last=Marymont|first=Mark|date=19 February 2002|work=[[Country Weekly]]|accessdate=21 July 2010}}</ref> William Ruhlmann called the album "sturdy formula country",<ref name="another" /> and Jeffrey B. Remz of ''Country Standard Time'' said that he "easily interpret[s]" the songs but "doesn't seem to be doing anything too dramatically different."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=1420|title=''In Another World'' review|last=Remz|first=Jeffrey B.|work=Country Standard Time|accessdate=21 July 2010}}</ref> After Monument closed its Nashville branch, Diffie began touring with [[Mark Chesnutt]] and [[Tracy Lawrence]] on the Rockin' Roadhouse Tour, which began in 2002.<ref name="cmt1" /> That same year, Diffie was inducted into the [[Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame]].<ref name="opry" />

Diffie signed to the independent [[Broken Bow Records]] in 2003. His only album for the label was ''[[Tougher Than Nails]]'', which he and Wilson produced with [[Buddy Cannon]]. It included five songs that Diffie co-wrote, as well as a duet with George Jones entitled "What Would Waylon Do".<ref name="cmt1">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1489563/joe-diffie-resurfaces-with-tougher-than-nails.jhtml |title=Joe Diffie Resurfaces With "Tougher Than Nails" |accessdate=19 July 2010 |work=[[CMT]].com}}</ref> ''Tougher Than Nails'' produced a Top 20 hit in its title track, followed by "If I Could Only Bring You Back", which peaked at number 50 and spent only eight weeks on the charts. This latter song was also his last charting single.<ref name="whitburn" /> Erlewine said of the album's content, "there's nothing new, but there doesn't need to be",<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r690464|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Tougher Than Nails'' review|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|work=Allmusic|accessdate=21 July 2010}}</ref> and ''Country Standard Time'' said that the album "shows that he's still got the talent that took him to stardom in the first place."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=1419|title=''Tougher Than Nails'' review|last=Weisberger|first=Jon|work=Country Standard Time|accessdate=21 July 2010}}</ref>

In 2005, [[Jo Dee Messina]] released "[[My Give a Damn's Busted]]", which Diffie co-wrote and originally recorded on ''In Another World''. Her version of the song, included on her album ''[[Delicious Surprise]]'', was a number one single that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/234448 |title=Success Floods Messina Via "My Give a Damn's Busted" |accessdate=19 July 2010 |work=[[Broadcast Music Incorporated]]}}</ref>

==Musical styles==
Steve Huey of Allmusic wrote that Diffie "lent his traditional sensibilities to humorous, rock-tinged novelties and plaintive ballads."<ref name="allmusic" /> His early albums for Epic mostly consisted of ballads, but starting with ''Honky Tonk Attitude'', he began to include more up-tempo and novelty numbers.<ref name="allmusic" /> Starting with ''A Night to Remember'', Diffie returned to a more ballad-oriented sound; Mike Kraski, then the senior vice president of sales for Sony Music Nashville, thought that the albums before it had over-emphasized his novelty releases.<ref name="night" />

Alanna Nash regularly compared Diffie's voice to that of George Jones. In her review of ''A Thousand Winding Roads'', she contrasted the album with [[Mark Chesnutt]]'s debut ''[[Too Cold at Home]]'' by saying, "While Chesnutt merely takes his inspiration from Jones, Diffie mimics Jones' delivery&nbsp;... But now that he's making records himself, [his vocal imitation] drops him to the rear of the pack, as a stylist with little style of his own."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20199859,00.html|title=''Too Cold at Home''/''A Thousand Winding Roads'' review|last=Nash|first=Alanna|date=17 December 1990|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=20 July 2010}}</ref> She thought that Diffie began to move away from his George Jones influences on ''A Night to Remember''.<ref name="ewnight">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273462,00.html|title=''A Night to Remember'' review|last=Nash|first=Alanna|date=21 May 1999|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=21 July 2010}}</ref> William Ruhlmann wrote that Diffie "has put together a decade-plus career in country largely on his ability to succeed" in "scour[ing] Nashville publishers for ten good compositions in the established style", and that he was an "adequate but undistinguished singer."<ref name="another">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r558459|pure_url=yes}}|title=''In Another World'' review|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|work=Allmusic|accessdate=21 July 2010}}</ref> Similarly, Wilcox described Diffie as having "the vocal chops to sound like just about anyone" and thought that none of his Epic material showed any musical identity.<ref name="the9513"/>

Diffie has been married three times. His first wife was Janise Parker, whom he married while in college. The couple divorced in 1986 and had two children: Parker and Kara.<ref name="people">{{cite journal|last=Sanz|first=Cynthia|date=26 April 1993|title=The Difference in Diffie|journal=[[People (magazine)|People]]|volume=39|issue=16|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20110245,00.html}}</ref> Parker later worked as Diffie's on-road manager in the mid-2000s,<ref name="ledger" /> and in mid-2010, he and Kara auditioned for ''[[American Idol]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theboot.com/2010/07/16/joe-diffie-american-idol/|title=Joe Diffie's Kids Try Out for 'American Idol'|last=Hughes|first=Donna|date=16 July 2010|work=The Boot|accessdate=27 July 2010}}</ref> Two years after divorcing Janise, Diffie married Debbie Jones, a nurse technician.
