{{spanish name 2|S<U+00E1>nchez|M<U+00E1>rquez}}
'''Hugo S<U+00E1>nchez M<U+00E1>rquez''' (July 11, 1958), popularly  nicknamed '''''Pentapichichi''''', or '''''Hugol''''', is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Association football|football]] [[coach (sport)|coach]] and former [[striker]]. He played for four European [[football club|clubs]], including [[Real Madrid]]. Sanchez is considered the first highly talented Mexican player. He was also a member of the [[Mexico national football team|Mexico national team]], and participated in three [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]].


As a coach, he won two championships as head coach of the club [[Pumas de la UNAM]] and briefly with [[Club Necaxa]], both teams in the [[Primera Divisi<U+00F3>n de M<U+00E9>xico|Mexican Primera Divisi<U+00F3>n]]. He also had a sixteen-month stint with the [[Mexico national football team|Mexican national team]], but was fired on [[March 31|March 31, 2008]].<ref>{{Cite document |last= |first= |title=Hugo Sanchez fired as coach of Mexico|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/31/sports/SOC-Mexico-Sanchez-Fired.php|accessdate=2008-03-31 |publisher= [[International Herald Tribune]] |postscript= <!--None-->}}</ref> Hugo Sanchez has signed up to start coaching again, now in Europe, for [[UD Almer<U+00ED>a]] [http://www.udalmeriasad.com/udalmeria/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1773&Itemid=59] from the Spanish First Division starting December 29, in an attempt to save the team from descending to the 2nd Division by the Summer. He has succeeded in keeping [[UD Almeria]] free from relegation from [[La Liga]] for the 2009-2010 season.

In 1999, the [[IFFHS]] voted him the 26th best [[football(soccer)|footballer]] of the 20th Century, and the best [[football (soccer)|footballer]] from the [[CONCACAF]] region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/iffhs-century.html#cnpoy | author=Stokkermans, Karel | publisher=[[RSSSF]] | title=IFFHS' Century Elections | accessdate=2006-12-17}}</ref>

== Early career ==
As a teenager, S<U+00E1>nchez played for the [[Mexico national football team]] in the [[1976 Summer Olympics]]. Having already played in over 80 international games, S<U+00E1>nchez signed as a youth player at the age of 18 for [[UNAM Pumas]], a professional team representing Mexico's National University, where he completed a degree in Dentistry while keeping up his football career. That year, UNAM managed to get its first championship in the [[Primera Divisi<U+00F3>n de M<U+00E9>xico|Mexican Football League]]. Two years later, he became top-scorer in the league with 26 goals. In 1979, UNAM agreed to exchange players during the off-seasons with the [[San Diego Sockers (NASL)|San Diego Sockers]] of the [[North American Soccer League]] (NASL). The NASL played during the summer and the Mexican League played during the fall, winter and spring. UNAM loaned S<U+00E1>nchez to the Sockers in both 1979 and 1980 where he became a dominant striker for the Sockers, averaging nearly a goal a game.

S<U+00E1>nchez' five seasons with UNAM were the team's golden years. In his last season with the team, Hugo and UNAM won its second championship and the [[CONCACAF Champions Cup]].

==Career ==
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Hugosanchez1.jpg|thumb|left|Hugo S<U+00E1>nchez.]] -->
After five successful seasons in Mexico, with 99 goals to his name, S<U+00E1>nchez drew the attention of several Spanish sides, and signed with [[Atl<U+00E9>tico Madrid]] in 1981. He turned down an offer to play for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal FC]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} It took him a while to find his feet in [[La Liga]], but by the 1984-85 season he was scoring regularly with a team that won the [[Copa del Rey]], finished in second place in the [[Spanish League]] and won the [[Spanish Super Copa]]. That year Hugo also won his first [[Pichichi trophy]] for being the most prolific scorer in the league.

At the high-point of his career, he signed for [[Real Madrid]] in 1985 and played with players such as [[Jos<U+00E9> Antonio Camacho|Camacho]], [[Emilio Butrague<U+00F1>o|Butrague<U+00F1>o]], [[Rafael Gordillo|Gordillo]], [[Bernd Schuster|Schuster]], [[Jorge Valdano|Valdano]] and [[Jos<U+00E9> Miguel Gonz<U+00E1>lez Mart<U+00ED>n|M<U+00ED>chel]]. This team won five consecutive league titles (from 1985-86 to 1989-90), the ''Copa del Rey'' in 1989, and the [[UEFA Cup]] in 1986. During those five years, S<U+00E1>nchez garnered four consecutive Pichichi trophies (the only player in Spain's football history to achieve this without sharing the trophy on any season), scoring 207 goals in 283 games. He scored 27 or more goals in four consecutive seasons between 1986 and 1990, including 38 goals in the 1989-90 season, tying the single-season record set in 1951 by [[Telmo Zarra]] and earning the [[European Golden Boot]] award to the best scorer in Europe. Overall, he scored 47 goals in 45 European Cup games.

In 1992, S<U+00E1>nchez returned to his native Mexico for a season, before playing for a variety of clubs in Spain, [[Austria]] and the USA (he played for the [[FC Dallas|Dallas Burn]] in the inaugural year of [[Major League Soccer]], becoming one of two people, along with [[Roy Wegerle]], to play outdoor football in both the [[North American Soccer League|NASL]] and [[Major League Soccer|MLS]]). He finished his career playing for [[Atl<U+00E9>tico Celaya]] with Butrague<U+00F1>o and M<U+00ED>chel, his old colleagues from Real Madrid.

==International career==
In comparison to his "domestic" club success, S<U+00E1>nchez did not have a successful international career with the Mexican national team. He played 60 matches and scored 29 goals for the [[Mexico national football team|Mexican national team]], but his years as a Mexican international coincided with a difficult period for the nation's football. Mexico did not participate in the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] of [[1982 World Cup|1982]] and [[1990 World Cup|1990]], in which S<U+00E1>nchez would have most likely been part of the Mexican squad. He scored one goal in eight appearances in the three World Cups in which he competed and was never selected for the [[FIFA World Cup awards#All-Star Team|"Best XI"]] World Cup squads. S<U+00E1>nchez's brash personality is often cited as the reason he did not play many games at the 1994 World Cup, purportedly as a result of internecine frictions between Hugo and the [[Federaci<U+00F3>n Mexicana de F<U+00FA>tbol Asociaci<U+00F3>n|Mexican Football Federation (FMF)]].{{citation needed|date=January 2007}}

== Retirement ==
S<U+00E1>nchez retired from Spanish football on May 29, 1997, playing with Real Madrid at the [[Santiago Bernab<U+00E9>u stadium]]<U+2014>the stadium that witnessed most of his glory throughout his career. His last official game was in the 1998 World Cup preliminaries where he just touched the ball as a symbol of his retirement.

=== Legacy ===
His trademark was to perform a celebratory somersault after each goal he scored, honoring his sister, who was a gymnast and participated in the Montreal Olympics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?cid=719108|author=Andal<U+00F3>, Paula |title=Hugo S<U+00E1>nchez, con alas en los pies|publisher=Univision|accessdate=2007-07-04|language=Spanish}}</ref> He is also known for acrobatic goals, some involving his trademark windmill kick, a product of his own early training in gymnastics.{{citation needed|date=January 2007}} To date, he has been the most successful Mexican football player by far to have played anywhere, in terms of years played, goalscoring, and achievements.

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Hugosanchez2.jpg|thumb|Hugo S<U+00E1>nchez with the [[UD Almer<U+00ED>a|Almeria]] in 2009.]] -->
In the year 2000, [[UNAM Pumas]]  was having a terrible championship. A new manager was needed, someone who could take the lead of one of the most important clubs in Mexico. The designated manager was Hugo S<U+00E1>nchez, idol and figure for UNAM's followers. So, in March, he signed for a 2 years contract with his most "beloved team". Although the very good campaign made by the team for that tournament, many differences became evident with the president of the club Javier Jim<U+00E9>nez Espri<U+00FA>, which resulted in his distitution in August of the same year. "I'll be back when Jimenez Espriu is out. I know I'm right and I know I'll be back," were his words as he left the team.

One year passed and Jimenez Espriu resigned as the club's president. The new president, Luis Regueiro, knew exactly who was going to be the next coach for the team, so in November 2001, S<U+00E1>nchez was again signed as head coach of all UNAM's teams and given all the confidence of the new broad.

His labor was long and well planned, as for two years he forged a very competitive team. In 2003, the results were evident, and the Pumas were one of the best teams in the league, but the championship was still missing. Falling twice in semifinals all was set to the New Age Golden Year, 2004.

S<U+00E1>nchez Pumas won everything they played in 2004: Clausura 2004, Apertura 2004, Champion of Champions 2004 and Santiago Bernabeu's Cup. Also he is the only manager in the history to lead a Mexican team to two championships in a row in the [[Primera Divisi<U+00F3>n de M<U+00E9>xico|Mexican first division]] in the new "short tournament" format (South American format).

However, by the end of 2004 things weren't as good as it might seem. The Clausura 2004 tournament was won taking advantage of the competition format, as they only made the minimum points during the league to qualify to the playoffs. For the next tournament Pumas was the worst team of the tournament and in Winter 2005 Pumas was having the worst year of its history. The club needed a change and S<U+00E1>nchez decided to resign in November 2005.

There are many speculations about why he resigned. The most well known was that the future didn't seem too optimistic. He stated "If you think I'm the problem, I leave now that there is time, before the team is in danger of descending".

After this turns of events, S<U+00E1>nchez took some vacations and went to Spain to offer his services. Getafe almost signed him but economic differences got in the way. In 2006, Club Necaxa, another Mexican team, signed him as a head coach, but this was very quickly finished as he was called as Mexican National Team coach.

After briefly managing [[Club Necaxa]], S<U+00E1>nchez was named head coach of the [[Mexico national football team|Mexico national team]], with the commitment of leading Mexico through the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|qualification process]] for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] finals in [[South Africa]].

During his coaching career especially, S<U+00E1>nchez has been known for his volatile temperament and willingness to speak candidly, often expressing strong emotions and opinions, a trait that engenders equally emotional and strong responses from those he criticizes. He has a long-standing feud between with former Mexican National Coach, [[Ricardo Lavolpe]].

S<U+00E1>nchez's first match as Mexico coach was a 2-0 loss to the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] in Phoenix, Arizona before Mexican fans in February, 2007. S<U+00E1>nchez recorded his first coaching victory against [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]] (3-1) in front of 67,000 "Tri" fans in San Diego at Qualcomm Stadium. Hugo's first game in Mexico took place against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in Monterrey, Mexico on March 25, 2007, which Mexico won 2-1. A few days later on March 28, 2007, Mexico defeated [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] 4-2 in Oakland, California at McAfee Coliseum.

In June, 2007 S<U+00E1>nchez coached Mexico in the [[2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2007 edition]] of the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup|Gold Cup]], his first official competition. After struggling in the first stages of the tournament, M<U+00E9>xico reached the final June 24, 2007 and lost it against to the US (2-1).

On June 27, 2007, in the opening game of the [[Copa Am<U+00E9>rica 2007]] held in Venezuela, S<U+00E1>nchez led the Mexican National Team to a stunning 2-0 win over 5-time world champions, [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] Hugo's  first major victory as a coach.  After glancing through the first round of the tournament, Hugo led the team to reach the semi-finals and battle against the Argentine squad, losing with a solid 3-0. Finally Mexico ended 3rd place of the competition by beating Uruguay 3-1.

In August 2007, S<U+00E1>nchez announced that Mexico would permanently, or at least in his time coaching the team, drop their famous green home kit, replacing it with their white away kit, meaning that their new away kit would be red. For this decision, S<U+00E1>nchez was subject of a lot of criticism. The two main arguments against him were that the decision was breaking a long-standing Mexican tradition, yet the strongest critics suggested that he should devote more time to the strategy and training of the Mexican team rather than entertaining himself with superfluous features of the sport.

In March 2008, S<U+00E1>nchez had some very upsetting results , including draws with [[Australia national football team|Australia]] and [[Finland national football team|Finland]] {{citation needed|date=March 2008}}, and a loss at home in [[Quer<U+00E9>taro]] against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]]'s U-23 team. The bad results continued in the CONCACAF Olympic Qualification, with a tie with Canada and a loss with Guatemala. Finally, his only victory coming against Haiti with a 5-1 score. However due to goal difference Mexico was eliminated from the Pre Olympic qualifying tournament. The elimination was a hard beat against the soccer in his country, particularly to the owners of the Mexican soccer clubs, who had supported him both economically and sportily by providing the resources and allowing the players to be separated from their teams for nearly a month, while the Mexican season was up.

Many analysts claim that S<U+00E1>nchez's first year as the national coach has resulted in a Mexican team with poor soccer variants, null collective game, tactic stiffness, and lack of strategy. A significant proportion of the press agree that this situation has reached a point of no return with the U-23 elimination from the Pre Olympic tournament. Hugo also made the decision to change the jersey color of the Mexican National team from green to white, due to his feelings on green being a color that blends into the grass.  On March 31, Hugo Sanchez was fired from the Mexican team via a 16-2 vote from the main leaders of the sixteen First Division Club Owners.
