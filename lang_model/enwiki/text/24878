'''[[Aneurysm]] of the [[aortic sinus]]''', also known as the [[sinus of Valsalva]], is comparatively rare.  When present, it is usually in either the right (65-85%) or in the noncoronary (10-30%) sinus, rarely in the left (< 5%) sinus.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==Causes==
This type of aneurysm is typically [[birth defects|congenital]] and may be associated with [[heart defects]].  It is sometimes associated with [[Marfan syndrome]] or [[Loeys-Dietz syndrome]], but may also result from [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[syphilis]], [[cystic medial necrosis]], chest injury, or infective [[endocarditis]].

==Presentation==
If unruptured, this type aneurysm may be asymptomatic and therefore go undetected until symptoms appear or [[medical imaging]] is performed for other reasons. A ruptured aneurysm typically leads to an aortocardiac shunt and progressively worsening heart failure. <ref>Gray's anatomy, 1902 ed.</ref>

An aneurysm of the aortic sinus may rupture due to [[infective endocarditis]] involving the aortic wall and tertiary-stage [[syphilis]].

The manifestations appear depending on the site where the sinus has ruptured. For example, if the sinus ruptures in a low pressure area like the right atrium or right ventricle then a continuous type of [[murmur]] is heard. The murmur is located in the left parasternal region mainly confined to the lower sternum. It is also accompanied by a superficial thrill. A ruptured Sinus of Valsalva abscess represents a surgical emergency.

==Treatment==
Medical therapy of [[aneurysm]] of the [[aortic sinus]] includes [[blood pressure]] control through the use of drugs, such as [[beta blockers]].

Another approach is surgical repair.<ref name="pmid11423277">{{cite journal |author=Vural KM, Sener E, Ta<U+015F>demir O, Bayazit K |title=Approach to sinus of Valsalva aneurysms: a review of 53 cases |journal=Eur J Cardiothorac Surg |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=71<U+2013>6 |year=2001 |month=July |pmid=11423277 |doi= 10.1016/S1010-7940(01)00758-8|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1010794001007588}}</ref>  The determination to perform surgery is usually based upon the diameter of the aortic root (with 5 centimeters being a rule of thumb - a normal size is 2-3 centimeters) and the rate of increase in its size (as determined through repeated [[echocardiography]]).
