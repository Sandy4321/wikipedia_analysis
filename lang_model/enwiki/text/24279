'''Stanley Marcus''' ([[April 20]], [[1905]] &ndash; [[January 22]], [[2002]]) was an early president (1950<U+2013>1972) and later chairman of the board (1972<U+2013>1976) of the luxury retailer [[Neiman Marcus]] in [[Dallas, Texas]]. The [[Advertising Hall of Fame]] notes: "Stanley Marcus was among the most important figures in the history of American retail merchandising and marketing. Through his many innovations, he transformed a local Dallas clothing store into an international brand synonymous with high style, fashion and gracious service."<ref name="aaf">[http://www.advertisinghalloffame.org/members/member_bio.php?memid=702&uflag=m&uyear= Stanley Marcus, Advertising Hall of Fame]</ref> 

==Personal life and early career==
Marcus was born the son of Herbert Marcus, Sr., who later became a co-founder of the original Neiman Marcus store with his sister, Carrie Neiman. Stanley was the first of four sons born to Herbert, Sr., and his wife, the former Minnie Lichtenstein; the pregnancy indirectly led to the eventual founding of Neiman-Marcus, as Herbert Sr. did not feel the raise he was offered by [[Sanger-Harris|Sanger's]] was sufficient to support a family and thus left the store where he was employed to strike out on his own.<ref name="stay">Rose G. Biderman. ''They Came to Stay: The Story of the Jews of Dallas 1870-1997.'' 2002, Eakin Press. (ISBN 1-57168-648-7)</ref> Returning from two years spent in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], establishing a successful sales-promotion business, the Marcuses and Neimans used the $25,000 made in the sale of that business to establish their store at the corner of Elm and Murphy.

One of Stanley Marcus's first jobs was with the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' as a salesman, bringing him into the family's business tradition from a young age. When he began his university, it was at [[Amherst College]], but left due to restrictions that prevented [[Judaism|Jews]] from joining clubs or [[fraternity|fraternities]].<ref name="reeves">Richard Reeves, [http://www.uexpress.com/richardreeves/index.html?uc_full_date=20020124 "Stanley Marcus Was a Great American"] (column), [[Universal Press Syndicate]], [[January 24]], [[2002]] (retrieved Nov. 6, 2006)</ref> After receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A. degree]] from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1925, he began his career at the retailer that same year as a simple stockboy organizing [[inventory]], but upon beginning in sales, quickly outstripped other sales staff.<ref name="timesells">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,895187,00.html "The Man Who Sells Everything"], ''TIME'', [[December 26]], [[1960]]</ref> He went back to study at [[Harvard Business School]] in 1926 and became a member of the historically Jewish fraternity [[Zeta Beta Tau]]. He married the former Mary "Billie" Cantrell in 1932; Mrs. Marcus initially worked in the N-M Sports Shop department until she retired in 1936 after the birth of their first child, Jerrie, followed two years later by twins Richard and Wendy.<ref name="stay">Biderman p. 58</ref>

Marcus was responsible for a number of innovations at the Dallas retailer. He created the annual Neiman-Marcus Award for Distinguished Service in Fashion, beginning in 1938, which led to the Neiman-Marcus Exposition, a fall fashion show held annually from 1938 to 1970, then periodically thereafter.<ref name="stay">p. 59</ref> He then introduced weekly fashion shows &mdash; the first [[United States|American]] ''[[haute couture]]'' boutique to do so<ref name="timeline">[http://www.texasmonthly.com/2002-03-01/webextra5.php Stanley Marcus Timeline] ''Texas Monthly'', March 2002</ref> &mdash; and made his the first department store to host concurrent art exhibitions not at some off-site museum, but at the store itself.<ref name="Schack">William Schack, "Neiman-Marcus of Texas" (article), ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine, 24:3, 212-222, September 1957.</ref>In 1939, he established the annual Christmas Catalogue, which in 1951 offered the first of its extravagant "His & Hers Gifts," starting with a matching pair of [[vicu<U+00F1>a]] coats, and going on to include matching bathtubs, a pair of [[Beechcraft]] airplanes, "[[Noah's Ark]]" (including pairs of animals), camels, and live tigers.<ref name="Schack">Commentary</ref><ref name="aaf">Hall of Fame</ref><ref name="nmoverview">[http://www.neimanmarcus.com/store/service/company_overview.jhtml;jsessionid=MJTBGRZOT1KBECQAAKHRABY Historical Timeline], from Neiman Marcus Online</ref><ref name="timesells">2nd ref</ref>

For all his professional emphasis on glitz and glamour, he made another, very different mark on the American fashion industry when he was asked to join the War Production Board in [[Washington, D.C.]] on [[December 27]], [[1941]], less than three weeks after the United States entered [[World War II]]. Ineligible for military service due to his age, he instead helped the war effort by championing the conservation of scarce resources normally devoted to fashion trends. He encouraged men to wear drooping socks (to save much-needed [[rubber]]<ref name="reeves">Reeves, socks</ref>) and devised regulations for the manufacture of women's and children's clothing that would enable the nation to divert more [[textile]] resources to uniforms and other war-related needs: 
{{cquote|''We settled on certain prohibitions, such as lengths, sleeve fullness, patch pockets, ensembles, sweeps of skirts, widths of belts and depth of hems. ... The restrictions we put into effect froze the fashion silhouette. It effectively prevented any change of skirt length downward and it blocked any extreme new sleeve or collar development, which might have encouraged women to discard existing clothes.''|40px|40px|Stanley Marcus<ref name="halkias">Article by Maria Halkias, ''The Dallas Morning News'', [[December 25]],[[2001]]</ref>|}}

==Taking the helm==
In 1950, with the death of Herbert Marcus, Sr., Stanley Marcus was elected president and [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of the company, with Carrie Neiman as [[chairman of the board]]. Neiman died in 1953.

Marcus began yet another N-M tradition, the "International [[Fortnight]]," in 1957 as a way to attract customers in the lull between the fall fashion rush and the [[Christmas]] shopping crunch. The idea was inspired by seeing a store in [[Stockholm, Sweden]] that was having a [[France]]-themed sales promotion, leading Marcus to propose to the French government a sponsorship of an even more elaborate event in his own store. The initial Fortnight included concurrent events of art, symphonic music, and film at other locations around Dallas, with an [[Air France]] jet bringing "writers, painters, government officials, models, and industry leaders." (Biderman, p. 60)<ref name="stay">p. 60, Biderman</ref> In the years following, the Fortnight focused on various other countries and added related food service as well as items from the relevant country in every department, ending in 1986 with the [[Australia|Australian]] Fortnight.

In 1969, Marcus recommended to the board of directors that the company merge with Broadway-Hale of California in order to have enough capital to expand. Neiman's subsequently became a subsidiary of [[Carter Hawley Hale Stores|Carter-Hawley Hale, Inc.]], and Marcus accepted a position as corporate executive vice president and director of CHH.<ref name="biderman">Biderman, p. 61</ref><ref name="images">[http://www.imagesfashion.com/back/feb/internationalnews.htm Retail Pioneer Stanley Marcus Passes Away]</ref> During his time as leader of the store, he had doubled annual profits and nearly tripled annual sales. He retired as Chairman Emeritus in 1975.<ref name="bernice">[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r107:E05FE2-0062: "Tribute to Mr. Stanley Marcus -- Hon. [[Eddie Bernice Johnson]]"], U.S. House of Representatives, February 5, 2002</ref><ref name="nmoverview">Historical Timeline</ref>

==Later life==
In addition to writing an early column for a Dallas periodical, Marcus was the author of multiple [[retailing]]-oriented books, including ''Minding the Store'', ''Quest for the Best'', and ''His & Hers: The Fantasy World of the Neiman Marcus Catalogue''. He was a close friend of other writers, including [[Jane Trahey]], an author and longtime advertising [[copy (written)|copywriter]] who at one time worked for Neiman Marcus, and historian [[David McCullough]]. A television presenter for the public broadcasting program ''[[American Experience]]'', McCullough said he once asked Stanley Marcus &mdash; "one of the wisest men I know" &mdash; what single problem or aspect of American life, if given a magic wand, he would change, to which Marcus replied, "I'd try to do something about television." When asked why, he explained, "Because," he said, "If you could do something about television, think how far you could go to solve all the other problems."<ref name="mccull">[http://www.current.org/why/why713m.shtml "After all we<U+2019>ve done, think how much more we can do"], ''Current'', July 21, 1997</ref>

Marcus was an avid art collector, as well as amassing a collection of [[mask]]s from around the world. In 2002, the [[Sotheby's]] auction house mounted a sale of works from his estate, calling Marcus "an insightful and forward-looking collector and a generous lender whose contributions to exhibitions helped bring notice to the world of Latin American Art during the 40s, 50s and 60s."<ref name="Sothebys">[http://www.shareholder.com/bid/news/20020805-87212.cfm Sotheby's To Offer Property From The Estate Of Stanley Marcus Fall 2002]</ref> The auction house also noted that Marcus had begun collecting at age five (influenced by his parents), but had found his interest in good design vastly deepened by a 1925 graduation trip to Europe, where he visited a famed international exhibition of decorative arts and thus was introduced to the earliest works of [[Art Deco]]. The Marcus collections included significant works by [[Mexico|Mexican]] artists [[Rufino Tamayo]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[Diego Rivera]], and Rivera's lesser-known friend and colleague [[Antonio Ru<U+00ED>z]]; the American sculptor [[Alexander Calder]], and American painter [[Georgia O'Keeffe]]. Marcus was friends with Rivera and Tamayo &mdash; playing a major role in bringing one of Tamayo's [[mural]]s to the [[Dallas Museum of Art]] &mdash; and one of the first board members of the O'Keeffe museum, which honored him at the time of his death with a paid notice in ''The New York Times'' that stated "Stanley's generous support, leadership, enthusiasm, friendship and keen artistic judgment were instrumental in the Museum's inception and success. We shall miss him greatly."<ref name="okeeffeobit">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D71E3BF937A15752C0A9649C8B63 Marcus, Stanley], ''The New York Times'', January 24, 2002</ref>

[[Southern Methodist University]] hosts a Stanley Marcus collection at its DeGolyer Library in Dallas, including photographs, correspondence, and clippings. The library also houses a collection of more than 5,000 miniature books donated by Marcus.
