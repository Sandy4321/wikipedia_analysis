'''Theoren Wallace "Theo" Fleury''' (born June 29, 1968) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] former professional [[ice hockey]] player for the [[Calgary Flames]], [[Colorado Avalanche]], [[New York Rangers]] and [[Chicago Blackhawks]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), [[Tappara]] of Finland's [[SM-liiga]], and the [[Belfast Giants]] of Great Britain's [[Elite Ice Hockey League]]. He was drafted by the Flames in the 8th round, 166th overall, at the [[1987 NHL Entry Draft]] and played over [[List of National Hockey League players with 1000 games played|1,000 games]] in the NHL between 1989 and 2003.  

One of the smallest players of his generation, Fleury played a physical style that often led to altercations. As a [[junior ice hockey|junior]], he was at the centre of the infamous [[Punch-up in Piestany]], a brawl that resulted in the disqualification of Canada and the Soviet Union from the [[1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]]. Once considered unlikely to play in the NHL due to his size, Fleury scored over [[List of National Hockey League players with 1000 points|1,000 points]] in his career and won the [[Stanley Cup]] in [[1989 Stanley Cup Finals|1989]] with the Flames. He twice represented Canada at the [[Winter Olympics]], winning a gold medal in [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002]].  Throughout his career he battled drug and alcohol addictions that ultimately forced him out of the NHL in [[2002<U+2013>03 NHL season|2003]]. He played one season in the British Elite Ice Hockey League in [[2005<U+2013>06 EIHL season|2005<U+2013>06]], and made two attempts to win the [[Allan Cup]]. After an unsuccessful NHL comeback attempt with the Flames, he retired in 2009.

Outside of hockey, Fleury overcame his addictions, operated a concrete business in Calgary with his family, and filmed a [[television pilot|pilot]] for a [[reality television]] show based around it. He marketed his own brand of clothing, which led him to play two professional [[baseball]] games for the [[Calgary Vipers]] of the [[Golden Baseball League]].  In 1995 he was diagnosed with [[Crohn's disease]], and his annual charity golf tournament has helped raise more than $1&nbsp;million for the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada. Fleury co-wrote ''[[Playing with Fire (Autobiography)|Playing with Fire]]'', an autobiography released in October 2009, in which he made allegations that he had been sexually abused by former coach [[Graham James (ice hockey)|Graham James]].

==Early life==
Fleury was born on June 29, 1968, in [[Oxbow, Saskatchewan|Oxbow]], [[Saskatchewan]], Canada, the first of Wally and Donna Fleury's three sons.  Wally was a hockey player whose dreams of a professional career ended when he broke his leg playing baseball in the summer of 1963; the injury helped fuel a drinking problem.<ref>{{harvnb|Malcolm|1997|pp=27<U+2013>28}}</ref>  Donna was a quiet, religious woman who battled drug addiction for many years.<ref name="Fire6">{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=6}}</ref>  Fleury is of [[M<U+00E9>tis]] heritage, as his grandmother Mary was [[Cree]].<ref name="Fire6" />  The Fleurys lived in [[Williams Lake, British Columbia]] for four years, a period that saw Theo's brother Ted born in 1970, before settling in [[Russell, Manitoba]] by 1973, the year his youngest brother Travis was born.<ref>{{harvnb|Malcolm|1997|p=29}}</ref>  Wally worked as a truck driver and maintenance worker at the arena in Russell.<ref name="Fire35">{{harvnb|Malcolm|1997|pp=35<U+2013>37}}</ref>

Always one of the smallest children in his class and without stable supervision at home, Fleury adopted an aggressive posture and later described himself as a bully.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=7}}</ref>  He turned to hockey as an outlet when he borrowed an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first game at the age of five.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=9}}</ref>  From that point on, he played hockey at every opportunity, often accompanying his father to the arena in Russell in the pre-dawn hours. He was described by his teachers as a determined youth, who would repeat any activity he failed at until he got it right.<ref name="Fire35" />

Although his mother was a [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]], Fleury was [[Roman Catholic]]. He attended mass from age 6 to 12, serving as an altar boy until the church's priest died of a heart attack, depriving Fleury of one of his earliest positive influences.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|pp=11<U+2013>12}}</ref>  Always lacking money and a stable home, Fleury received support from the community, in particular the Peltz family in Russell, who ensured that he and his brothers were fed and bought them new clothes when required.<ref name="Fleury19">{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=19}}</ref>  In January 1982, Fleury's dreams of playing in the NHL nearly ended at the age of 13 when, during a game, he suffered a deep cut under his arm that severed his [[brachial artery]].  He missed nearly a year of contact hockey as a result.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|pp=14<U+2013>17}}</ref>  Five months after the incident, the community raised money to send him to the [[Andy Murray (ice hockey)|Andy Murray]] Hockey School in [[Brandon, Manitoba]].<ref>{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=18}}</ref>  It was there that Fleury met [[Graham James (ice hockey)|Graham James]], who was working as a scout for the [[Winnipeg Warriors]] of the [[Western Hockey League]] (WHL).  James told Fleury that he had the skill to play in the NHL despite his size, and promised to recruit him to play junior hockey for the Warriors when he was old enough.<ref name="Fleury19" />

==Playing career==
===Junior===
Fleury began his junior career in 1983<U+2013>84 as a 15&nbsp;year&nbsp;old with the [[St. James Canadians]] of the [[Manitoba Junior Hockey League]], scoring 33&nbsp;[[goal (ice hockey)|goals]] and 64&nbsp;[[point (ice hockey)|points]] in 22&nbsp;games.<ref name="LOHFleury">{{citation |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=10485 |title=Player profile <U+2013> Theoren Fleury |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2009-09-19}}</ref> In [[1984<U+2013>85 WHL season|1984<U+2013>85]] he moved to the [[Moose Jaw Warriors]], who had just relocated from Winnipeg, and scored 29&nbsp;goals and 75&nbsp;points in 71&nbsp;games as a 16&nbsp;year&nbsp;old. He improved his totals in each of his four years in the WHL, culminating with a 68-goal, 92-[[assist (ice hockey)|assist]] season in [[1987<U+2013>88 WHL season|1987<U+2013>88]].<ref name="LOHFleury" /> Fleury's 160&nbsp;points tied him for the league lead with [[Joe Sakic]], and the two players shared the [[Bob Clarke Trophy]] as the WHL's top scorers.<ref>{{harvnb|Flett|2009|pp=40<U+2013>41}}</ref>  Fleury's 92&nbsp;assists and 160&nbsp;points remain team records; he also holds the Warriors' career records for goals (201), assists (271) and points (472).<ref>{{harvnb|Flett|2009|p=83}}</ref>  {{asof|2010}}, he remains 10th all-time in WHL scoring.<ref name="Fire50">{{Harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=83}}</ref>

He found that the best way to protect himself was to intimidate his opponents by playing a physical game,<ref>{{Harvnb|Fleury|2009|pp=97<U+2013>98}}</ref> which he said led to many retaliatory penalties and several arguments with his coaches.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=102}}</ref>  He recorded 235&nbsp;[[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalties in minutes]] in his final year of junior, nearly 100 more than any of the other top 10 WHL scorers.<ref>{{harvnb|Flett|2009|p=173}}</ref>  Fleury retained this style of play throughout his hockey career, routinely surprising opponents who felt their size was an advantage.<ref>{{citation |last=Johnson |first=George |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/Back+saddle/1990696/story.html |title=Back in the saddle |work=Calgary Herald |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2009-11-01 |ref=}}</ref>

Fleury twice represented [[Canada men's national junior ice hockey team|Canada]] at the [[IIHF World U20 Championship|World Junior Hockey Championships]].  He first joined the team for the [[1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|1987 tournament]] in [[Pie<U+0161><U+0165>any]], [[Czechoslovakia]].  The tournament is best remembered for the "[[Punch-up in Piestany]]" on January 4, 1987, an infamous [[bench-clearing brawl]] between the Canadians and the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]]. Fleury scored the first goal of the game and, as part of his celebration, used his stick to mimic firing a [[machine gun]] at the Soviet bench, a move that was criticized by Canadian officials.<ref>{{Harvnb|Joyce|2006|p=126}}</ref> The brawl began early in the second period with Canada leading 4<U+2013>2 when [[Pavel Kostichkin]] slashed Fleury, leading to a fight between the two. It quickly escalated into a [[line brawl]] involving all skaters on the ice, after which the Soviet players left their bench, followed closely by the Canadians.<ref name="cbcarchives">{{citation |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/clips/12742/ |title=The Punch-up in Piestany |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2008-09-19}}</ref> Both teams were disqualified from the tournament, costing Fleury and the Canadians a medal <U+2013> potentially the gold.<ref>{{Harvnb|Joyce|2006|p=148}}</ref>

The [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] suspended all players involved in the brawl from participating in international tournaments for 18&nbsp;months, though the bans were later reduced to 6&nbsp;months on appeal.  This reduction allowed Fleury to participate in the [[1988 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|1988 tournament]] in [[Moscow]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Joyce|2006|p=215}}</ref>  He was named captain,<ref name="Fire50" /> finished second in team scoring with eight points in seven games, and was named a tournament all-star as Canada won the gold medal.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.tsn.ca/World_jrs/feature/?fid=987 |title=WJHC history (gold) <U+2013> 1988 |publisher=The Sports Network |accessdate=2009-09-19}}</ref>

Although he scored 129 points for the Warriors in [[1986<U+2013>87 WHL season|1986<U+2013>87]],<ref name="LOHFleury" /> Fleury's small stature led many teams to doubt that he could play in the NHL.<ref name="HeraldTimeline">{{citation |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/hockey/calgary-flames/Theoren+Fleury+timeline/1872226/story.html |title=Theoren Fleury: A timeline |work=Calgary Herald |date=2009-08-08 |accessdate=2009-09-19}}</ref> The [[Calgary Flames]] drafted him in the 8th round, 166th overall, of the [[1987 NHL Entry Draft]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=128}}</ref> Upon completing his junior season in 1988, Fleury signed his first professional contract, worth [[Canadian Dollar|C$]]415,000, and joined the Flames' [[International Hockey League (1945<U+2013>2001)|International Hockey League]] (IHL) affiliate, the [[Salt Lake Golden Eagles]].<ref name="Fire50" />  He scored seven points in two regular season games, then 16 more in eight playoff games as the Eagles won the [[Turner Cup]] championship.<ref name="LOHFleury" />

After improving to 33&nbsp;goals in his first full season, Fleury broke out in [[1990<U+2013>91 NHL season|1990<U+2013>91]], scoring [[List of NHL players with 50 goal seasons|51 goals]] and [[List of NHL players with 100 point seasons|104 points]] to lead the Flames offensively.<ref>{{harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=150}}</ref> He played in the [[42nd National Hockey League All-Star Game|1991 All-Star Game]],<ref name="MediaGuide All-Star">{{harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=24}}</ref> scoring a goal in an 11<U+2013>5 victory by the [[Campbell Conference]] over the [[Wales Conference]].

Fleury fell back to 33&nbsp;goals in [[1991<U+2013>92 NHL season|1991<U+2013>92]] as the Flames missed the playoffs.<ref>{{harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=149}}</ref> That season, he made his [[43rd National Hockey League All-Star Game|second All-Star Game]] appearance, recording a goal for the Campbell Conference.

The [[1994<U+2013>95 NHL lockout]] reduced the season to 48 games from 84.  During the lockout, Fleury played for [[Tappara]] in Finland's top league, the [[SM-liiga]].  He recorded 17 points in ten games before the NHL's labour dispute was resolved, bringing him back to Calgary.<ref name="LOHFleury" />  Late in the season, Fleury recorded two goals and an assist against the Oilers on March 31, 1995, to surpass 500&nbsp;career points.<ref name="TradeTimeline" />

Lacking a contract prior to the [[1995<U+2013>96 NHL season|1995<U+2013>96 season]], Fleury staged a brief hold-out during training camp before signing a five-year, $12&nbsp;million deal with the Flames. He agreed to take less money than he could have received on the open market out of loyalty to the franchise that had given him his NHL opportunity.<ref>{{citation |last=Board |first=Mike |title=Loyalty over Loonies |work=Calgary Herald |date=1995-09-23 |page=E1 |ref=}}</ref> He missed much of the pre-season with a stomach ailment, but joined the team for the season opener.<ref>{{citation |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Fleury pencils himself into lineup |work=Calgary Herald |date=1995-10-04 |page=C1 |ref=}}</ref>  Although he felt like somebody was "stabbing a knife in [his] gut every five minutes", Fleury had played every game for the Flames when he revealed in December 1995 that he had been diagnosed with [[Crohn's Disease]] and doctors had finally found the correct medication to control it.<ref>{{citation |last=Maki |first=Allan |title=Fleury battling Crohn's |work=Calgary Herald |date=1995-12-28 |page=C7}}</ref>  Despite the ailment, Fleury led the team in goals, assists and points,<ref>{{harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=145}}</ref> and played in his third [[46th National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], serving as Calgary's only representative.<ref name="MediaGuide All-Star" />

When [[Joe Nieuwendyk]] refused to report to the Flames prior to the 1995 season, they named Fleury interim captain.  The title was made permanent when Nieuwendyk was traded in December.<ref name="TradeTimeline" />  Fleury was reluctant to assume the captaincy, but did so out of loyalty to the team and because there was nobody else capable of taking on the role.<ref>{{citation |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Fleury steps down as Flames' captain |work=Calgary Herald |date=1997-07-03 |page=E3 |ref=}}</ref>  He relinquished it two seasons later after deciding that it was harming his play and affecting his relationship with his teammates and coach [[Pierre Pag<U+00E9>]].<ref name="NYTCaptain">{{citation |last=Lapointe |first=Joe |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/28/sports/hockey-wearing-hockey-s-badge-leadership-captain-s-c-carries-much-influence-ice.html |title=Wearing hockey's badge of leadership |work=New York Times |date=1997-09-28 |accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref>

Fleury feared that Jennifer's frustration with his drug use would cost him the relationship, and, with her help, quit drugs and drinking on September 18, 2005.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|pp=303<U+2013>304}}</ref>  They were married one year later and have a daughter, Skylah.<ref>{{citation |last=Francis |first=Eric |url=http://www.calgarysun.com/sports/columnists/eric_francis/2009/09/17/10951351-sun.html |title='She's my winger' |work=Calgary Sun |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2009-09-23 |ref=}}</ref>  Fleury also has a son and daughter, Beaux and Tatym, from his relationship with his first wife, Veronica,<ref>{{citation |last=Dellapina |first=John |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2001/11/22/2001-11-22_the_family_man___after_nearl.html |title=The family man |work=New York Daily News |date=2001-11-22 |accessdate=2009-09-23}}</ref> and a son, Josh, born in 1987 to his high school girlfriend, Shannon.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=34}}</ref>

In 1994, Fleury joined a group that involved his former junior coach, [[Graham James (ice hockey)|Graham James]], fellow NHL player [[Joe Sakic]], and professional wrestler [[Bret Hart]] as a minority owner of the expansion [[Calgary Hitmen]] of the [[Western Hockey League]].<ref>{{citation |last=Tucker |first=Larry |title=Method to this madness |work=Calgary Herald |date=1994-06-24 |page=62}}</ref>  He sold his share of the team to the Flames in 1997 in the aftermath of James' conviction for sexually abusing [[Sheldon Kennedy]] and another player.<ref>{{citation |last=Board |first=Mike |title=Flames take shot at owning Hitmen |work=Calgary Herald |date=1997-06-14 |page=E1 |ref=}}</ref>  After returning from Northern Ireland, he operated Fleury's Concrete Coatings, a concrete sealing business he started with his wife Jennifer and brother Travis, until it closed in 2009.<ref>{{citation |last=Francis |first=Eric |url=http://www.calgarysun.com/sports/columnists/eric_francis/2009/09/11/10835541-sun.html |title=Talk of Theo signing heats up |work=Calgary Sun |date=2009-09-11 |accessdate=2009-10-31}}</ref> He filmed a [[pilot episode]] in 2007 for a reality TV series based on his concrete business called ''Theoren Fleury: Rock Solid'': "We want to show people that if you have a dream, anything is possible with a little ambition," Fleury said of the show.<ref>{{citation |last=Doody |first=Kelly | url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/MediaNews/2007/12/15/4726246-sun.html | title=Rogers bash lives up to Christmas billing |work=Calgary Sun |date=2007-12-15 | accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref>  It was not picked up by any network

The 2008 launch of clothing line "FAKE" (Fleury's Artistic Kustom Enterprises) led him to approach the [[Calgary Vipers]] of the [[Golden Baseball League]] in the hope of convincing them to use his brand of practice jerseys.  The conversation led to talk of Fleury playing a game for the Vipers as a publicity stunt.<ref>{{citation |last=McIntyre |first=Heather | url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/sports/story.html?id=c370a204-3c51-4353-a1f6-d80a37091886 | title=Fleury will be a Viper for a day | work=Calgary Herald |date=2008-05-23 | accessdate=2009-10-31}}</ref>  He made his professional baseball debut on August 9, 2008 at the age of 40, hitting a [[single (baseball)|single]] in a [[pinch hitter|pinch-hit]] appearance against the [[Yuma Scorpions]].

"I've had so many things happen in my life already that I sometimes surprise myself with the things I've done, the things I've accomplished.

Fleury has organized or participated in numerous charitable causes.  He launched a hockey school in the mid 1990s that ran for seven years in Calgary and another eight in Russell, and donated the proceeds to minor hockey associations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fleury|2009|pp=116<U+2013>118}}</ref> Following his diagnosis with [[Crohn's Disease]] in 1995, Fleury joined with the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada to host an annual golf tournament in Calgary.

===Autobiography===
With the help of [[Kirstie McLellan Day]], Fleury wrote his autobiography, ''[[Playing with Fire (Autobiography)|Playing with Fire]]'', which was released on October 16, 2009. In it, he alleged that he was sexually abused by Graham James over a period of two years. While he stated he "doesn't want to become the poster boy for abuse by James", Fleury hoped that speaking out might make it easier for other childhood sexual abuse victims to come forward.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2009/10/09/sp-fleury-tell-all.html |title=Fleury tell-all book chronicles sexual abuse |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2009-10-09 |accessdate=2009-10-10}}</ref>  He blamed the abuse for turning him into a "raging, alcoholic lunatic",<ref>{{citation |last=Maki |first=Allan |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/fleury-opens-up-about-sexual-abuse/article1319778/ |title=Fleury opens up about sexual abuse |work=The Globe and Mail |date=2009-10-10 |accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref> and claimed to have placed a loaded gun in his mouth and contemplated suicide in 2004.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/health/Fleury+pondered+suicide+autobiography+reveals/2098274/story.html |title=Fleury pondered suicide, autobiography reveals |work=Calgary Herald |date=2009-10-14 |accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref>  He revealed that he had spent most of his income on alcohol, drugs, gambling and women.<ref>{{citation |last=MacIntyre |first=Iain |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/sports/Smarter+fitter+sober+Fleury+playing+with+fire+again/2018822/story.html |title=Smarter, fitter and sober Fleury playing with fire again |work=Vancouver Sun |date=2009-09-22 |accessdate=2009-11-01}}</ref> Fleury also claimed that he failed 13 consecutive drug tests while playing for the Rangers, but that the league did not want to suspend him because he was a leading scorer.  The league disputed this, and stated that its substance abuse program functioned appropriately.<ref>{{citation |last=Klein |first=Jeff Z. |url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/wednesdays-news-of-hockey-91409-nhl-answers-fleurys-drug-test-allegations/ |title=N.H.L. answers Fleury's drug test allegations |work=New York Times |date-2009-10-14 |accessdate=2009-10-20 | date=2009-10-14}}</ref>

''Playing With Fire'' became the top seller on [[Amazon.com|Amazon.ca]] within a week of its release, and Fleury stated that he had been contacted by several sexual abuse victims who were motivated by his book to seek help.<ref name="CFCNinterview">{{citation |url=http://calgary.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20091019/CGY_fleury_theo_091017/20091019/?hub=CalgaryHome |title=Fleury's book helping others |publisher=CTV Calgary |date=2009-10-19 |accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref>  He also revealed that he was contemplating a criminal complaint against James,<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/alberta/story/2009/10/14/sp-fleury-allegations-official.html |title=Fleury may press charges against James |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2009-10-14 |accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref> and had begun volunteering with an organization dedicated to helping male sexual abuse victims.<ref name="CFCNinterview" />  Fleury was surprised that his story became the top selling non-fiction book in Canada; without help, he and his wife were unable to keep up with the mail they were receiving.<ref>{{citation |last=MacLeod |first=Meredith |url=http://www.thespec.com/News/Business/article/663459 |title=Ice and fire: hockey star Fleury inspires as author, role model |work=Hamilton Spectator |date=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2009-11-01}}</ref>  It is the second book about Fleury's life, following ''Fury'', released in 1997, which did not discuss many of the problems he was facing at the time.<ref>{{citation |last=Johnson |first=George |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/sports/story.html?id=2004931 |title=Fleury no longer playing with fire |work=National Post |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2009-11-01 |ref=}}</ref>
