The '''timeline of [[children's rights]] in the [[United Kingdom]]''' includes a variety of events that are both [[political]] and [[grassroots]] in nature. The first [[Child Abuse|child cruelty]] case in Britain was brought by the [[NSPCC|RSPCA]], which was founded in 1822. The court charge list in the trial described the affected child as "a small animal" because at the time there were no laws in Britain to protect children from mistreatment. The case was successful.<ref>[http://www.rspca.org.uk/servlet/Satellite?pagename=RSPCA/RSPCARedirect&pg=about_the_rspca&marker=1&articleId=996827934749 "About the RSPCA - History"] RSPCA.

The UK government maintains a position that [[UNCRC]] is not legally enforceable and is hence 'aspirational' only, although a 2003 [[ECHR]] ruling states that, "The human rights of children and the standards to which all governments must aspire in realising these rights for all children are set out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child."<ref>Extract from ''Sahin v Germany'', Grand Chamber judgment of the ECHR, 8/7/03 as quoted in [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200304/jtselect/jtrights/161/16112.htm "4.

The UNCRC defines children, for the purposes of the Convention, as persons under the age 18, unless domestic legislation provides otherwise. In that spirit, this timeline includes as children all those below the UK age of majority, which was 21 until 1971, when it was reduced to 18. Although the [[Crown Dependencies]] [[Isle of Man]], [[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]] are not formally part of the UK, their close relationship with the UK through both [[the Crown]] and governmental and parliamentary liaison makes it relevant to include in this timeline some references to matters in those dependencies.

| Early History
|
| The care of [[Orphanage|orphans]] was particularly commended to bishops and monasteries during the Middle Ages. Many orphanages practised some form of "binding-out" in which children, as soon as they were old enough, were given as apprentices to households to ensure their support and their learning an occupation. [[Common law]] maintaining the [[King's peace]] was administered by the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)]] dealing with civil cases between [[Party (law)|parties]] by ordering the fine of debts and seizure of the goods of outlaws. Following the [[Peasants' Revolt]], British [[constables]] were authorised under a [[Origins of the Poor Law system|1383 statute]] to collar [[Vagabond (person)|vagabond]]s and force them to show their means of support; if they could not, the penalty was gaol. Under a 1494 statute, vagabonds could be sentenced to the stocks for three days and nights[http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/Law.htm#48Geo3c96]; in 1530, whipping was added. The assumption was that vagabonds were unlicenced beggars.

| [[Scotland]] 
| The national [[Church of Scotland]] set out a programme for spiritual reform, setting the principle of a [[History of education|school teacher]] for every parish church and [[free education]]. This was provided for by an Act of the [[Parliament of Scotland]], passed in 1633, which introduced a tax to pay for this programme.<ref>[http://www.rps.ac.uk/ Records of the Parliament of Scotland] official website.

| 1601   
| Elizabethan [[Poor Law]]   
| The Poor Law was the social security system operating in England and Wales from the 16th century until the establishment of the Welfare State in the 20th century. The [[Impotent poor]] was a classification of poverty used to refer to those poor considered deserving of poor relief; a [[Vagrancy|vagrant]] was a person who could work, but preferred not to. The law did not distinguish between the impotent poor and the criminal, so both received the same punishments. The law provided for "the putting out of children to be apprentices".

| 17th Century
| 
| Where an unmarried mother concealed the death of her baby, she was presumed guilty of [[infanticide]] unless she could prove that the baby was born dead (this requirement that the defendant prove her innocence was a reversal of the normal practice of requiring the prosecution to prove the defendant's guilt). Women were acquitted of this charge if they could demonstrate that they had prepared for the birth of the baby, for example by acquiring some kind of bedding.<ref>[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/oldbailey/history/crime/crimes.html#infanticide Crimes tried at the Old Bailey.] Retrieved 23 August 2008

| [[Bastard]]y 
| In 1732, a woman pregnant with a "[[bastard]]" was required to declare the fact and to name the father. 
In 1733, the putative father became responsible for maintaining his illegitimate child; failing to do so could result in gaol. The parish would then support the mother and child, until the father agreed to do so, whereupon he would reimburse the parish <U+2014> although this rarely happened. 
In 1744, a bastard took the [[settlement]] of its mother (under the [[Poor Law]], a person's place of origin or later established residence, being the Parish responsible for the person if destitute) regardless of where the child was actually born. Previously, a bastard took settlement from its place of birth. The mother was to be publicly whipped.<ref>Higginbotham, P.

On reception they were sent to [[wet nurse]]s in the countryside, where they stayed until they were about four or five years old. At sixteen girls were generally [[apprenticed]] as [[servants]] for four years; at fourteen, boys became apprentices in varying occupations for seven years.<ref>[http://www.victorianlondon.org/health/foundlinghospital.htm "Victorian London - Health and Hygiene - Hospitals - Foundling Hospital"].

|-
| 1779
| The [[Penitentiary Act]]
| Drafted by [[Prison reform]]er [[John Howard]], the Act introduced state prisons as an alternative to the death penalty or transportation. The prison population had risen after the US Declaration of Independence, because the American Colonies had been used as the destination for transported criminals. Howard's 1777 report had identified appalling conditions in most of the prisons he inspected. The [[Howard League for Penal Reform]] emerged as a result, publishing in 2006 the findings of an independent inquiry by Lord Carlile of Berriew QC into physical restraint, solitary confinement and forcible strip searching of children in prisons, secure training centres and local authority secure children's homes. <ref>http://www.howardleague.org/index.php?id=youngpeople</ref>
|-
| 1795
| [[Speenhamland system]]
| An amendment to the Poor Law, named after a meeting at the Pelican Inn in Speenhamland, Berkshire, where the local [[magistrates]] or ''[[squire]]archy'' devised the system as a means to alleviate hardship caused by a spike in grain prices. Families were paid extra to top up wages to a set level, which varied according to the number of children and the price of bread. For example if bread was 1s 2d a loaf, the wages of a family with two children was topped up to 8s 6d. If bread rose to 1s 8d the wages were topped up to 11s 0d. The system aggravated the underlying causes of poverty, allowing employers (often farmers) to pay below subsistence wages, because the parish made up the difference to keep their workers alive. Low incomes remained unchanged and the poor rate contributors subsidised the farmers, so that landowners sought other means of dealing with the poor eg the [[workhouse]]. The Poor Law Commissioners' Report of 1834 called the Speenhamland System a "universal system of pauperism."

| The workhouse system was set up in England and Wales under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, although many individual houses existed before this legislation. Inmates entered and left as they liked and would receive free food and accommodation. However, workhouse life was made as harsh and degrading as possible so that only the truly destitute would apply. Accounts of the [[Andover_workhouse_scandal|terrible conditions]] in [[The_Huddersfield_workhouse_scandal_(1848)|some workhouses]] include references to women who would not speak and children who refused to play.

| [[Mettray Penal Colony]] 
| In Mettray, north of the city of Tours, France a private reformatory, without walls, was opened by penal reformer Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric-Auguste Demetz in 1840 for the rehabilitation of young males aged between 6 and 21. At that time children and teenagers were routinely imprisoned with adults. Boys who were mostly deprived, disadvantaged or adandoned children, many of whom had committed only [[Summary offence]]s or [[petty crime]], were housed. Their heads were shaved, they wore uniforms, and up to age 12 spent most of the day studying arithmetic, writing and reading. Older boys had one hour of classes, with the rest of the day spent working. [[Reformatory Schools]] were modelled on Mettray, and the [[Borstal]] system, established in 1905, separated adolescents from adult prisoners. In the ''twentieth century'' Mettray became the focus for [[Michel Foucault]] because of its various systems and expressions of power and led Foucault to suggest that Mettray began the descent into modern penal theories and their inherent power structures.<ref>Foucault, Michel Discipline and Punish London: Penguin Books 1977 p 293</ref>
|-
| 1847
| [[Juvenile Offenders Act]] 
| The Act allowed children under the age of fourteen to be tried summarily before two magistrates, speeding up the process of trial for children, and removing it from the publicity of the higher courts. The age limit was raised to sixteen in 1850. 
|-
| 1854
| Reformatory Schools
| [[Mary Carpenter]]'s research and lobbying contributed to the [[Youthful Offenders Act 1854]] and the [[Reformatory Schools (Scotland) Act 1854]]. These enabled voluntary schools to be certified as efficient by the Inspector of Prisons, and allowed courts to send them convicted juvenile offenders under 16 for a period of 2 to 5 years, instead of prison. Parents were required to contribute to the cost. Carpenter's 1851 publication ''Reformatory Schools for the Children of the Perishing and Dangerous Classes and for Juvenile Offenders'' was the first to coin the term 'Dangerous Classes' with respect to the lower classes, and the perceived propensity to criminality, of poor people.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

| 1857
| [[Industrial School]]s
| The [[Industrial Schools Act 1857]] allowed magistrates to send disorderly children to a residential industrial school, resolving the problems of [[juvenile delinquency]] by removing poor and neglected children from their home environment into a boarding school. An 1876 Act led to non-residential day schools of a similar kind. In 1986 Professor Sir Leon Radzinowitz noted the practice of [[Economic conscription]], where, <U+2018>there was a network of 208 schools: 43 reformatories, 132 industrial schools, 21 day industrial schools and 12 truant schools<U+2019> by the eve of the First World War, alongside a negligible education system for the poor. <ref>http://isbndb.com/d/book/the_emergence_of_penal_policy_in_victorian_and_edwardian_eng.html</ref>

The Act first introduced and enforced [[Compulsory education|compulsory school attendance]] between the ages of 5 and 12, with [[school board]]s set up to ensure that children attended school; although exemptions were made for illness and travelling distance. The [[London School Board]] was highly influential and launched a number of political careers.

The system of operation was broadly as follows: infants and younger girls and boys are chiefly "boarded out" in rural districts; girls above 14 years of age are sent to 'industrial training homes' to be taught useful domestic occupations; boys above 17 years old are first tested in labour homes and then placed in employment at home, sent to sea or emigrated; boys between 13 - 17 years old were trained for trades for which they may be mentally or physically fitted.

| Following campaigning by the [[National Education League]] the [[Elementary Education Act 1880]] made schooling compulsory until the age of ten and also established attendance officers to enforce attendance, so that parents who objected to compulsory education, arguing they needed children to earn a wage, could be fined for keeping their children out of school.

Superseded by the [[National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939]] enacted immediately by Parliament on 3 September 1939 - the date of declaration of war on Germany. Liability to full-time conscription was enforced on all males between 18 and 41.

The [[Children Act 1948]] finally brought together responsibility for children without adequate parents, formerly dealt with under the [[Poor Law]], and responsibility for delinquent children in Remand Homes+, formerly under the aegis of Local Education Authorities, with the  requirement for every County and County Borough to establish a Children's Committee and appoint a Children's Officer. This has been the basis on which social workers have acted on behalf of children ever since. <ref>http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4412917.ece Letter to The Times by Lady Allen of Hurtwood, followed, by the Report of the Care of Children Committee, chaired by Dame Myra Curtis, prompted The Children Act 1948.

Detention Centres, under the Prison Department of the Home Office, were later introduced for [[Summary offence|miscreants]], designed to [[Common law|administer]] a "short sharp shock" to older teenagers through drilling, physical jerks, military-style discipline, and cold showers before dawn.

| One of the most serious riots in the 20th century fuelled by racial and social discord, brought black and white youth into violent confrontation with thousands of police. Further riots ensued that year throughout Britain. The [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_parliament/3631579.stm Scarman report] detailed a loss of confidence and mistrust in the police and their methods of policing after liason arrangements between police, community and local authority had collapsed. Recommendations for policing reforms were introduced in 1984. However, the 1999 enquiry into teenager [[Stephen Lawrence]]'s murder found that Scarman's recommendations had been ignored, and concluded that the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] was "institutionally racist".

During police investigations into Ms Taylor's concerns in 1986-87, the authorities constructed a "wall of disbelief" from the outset. An inquiry ordered by the Home Secretary in 1996 into quality of care and standards of education, found both to be below acceptable levels in all the homes investigated.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/16/2/00/1 Questions and answers that surround a catalogue of abuse against children | UK news | The Guardian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Provisions apply to all children under 18.It was very wide-ranging and covered all paid childcarers outside the parental home for under-8's, adoption and fostering, and many aspects of family law including divorce.

| Concerns about children in residential care led to the commissioning of 10 public enquiries between 1990 and 1996, including the Utting report (1991) and the [[Lord Warner|Warner]] report (1992), which exposed large-scale institutional abuse of children and young people. Sir William Utting CBE was Chief Inspector of Social Services during the period when some of the worst cases of abuse happened. Asked why safeguarding steps were not taken when he was directly responsible for overseeing Social Services, he replied: "...the crude answer to that question would be ignorance. There were tremendous pressures, I think, on everybody in the system at that time to deny that those of us working in the system and accepted by the community as being 'devoted to the interests of children' were in fact exploiting them and abusing them. So there was a period of ignorance and...denial and then the ...process of the revelation of these awful things that had gone on for a long time."<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmselect/cmhealth/319/31914.htm House of Commons - Health - Second Report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

| UK Government
| The [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] abolished the distinction in England and Wales with regard to [[Defense of infancy|criminal responsibility]] between young persons aged at least 14 and children aged between 10 and 14. Hitherto, a child over 10 but under 14 was deemed in law to be ''doli incapax'', i.e. incapable of crime, unless the prosecution could satisfy the court that a particular child was in fact of such maturity, education and social development as to rebut that presumption. (Children under 10 in England and Wales remain ''doli incapax'', as they have been since the minimum age for criminal responsibility was raised from 8 to to 10 under the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1963]]; power under the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 to raise the minimum age from 10 to 14 has never been implemented. In Scotland the mimimum age remains at 8, but the presumption of ''doli incapax'' also remains). Describing Youth Courts as the 'secret garden' of the legal system, Home Secretary [[Jack Straw]] established the Youth Justice system, with [[Restorative Justice]] premised as the key underlying principle for resolving youth crime. <ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2006/oct/22/youthjustice.prisons Judge admits: Britain's youth courts 'in chaos' | Society | The Observer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The campaign derived from the USA's so-called [[Megan's Law]], operating in honour of murder victim Megan Kanka and allowing publication of a sex offender's photograph and address.
