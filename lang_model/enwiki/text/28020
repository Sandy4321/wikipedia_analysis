'''William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield''', [[Serjeant-at-law|SL]], [[Privy Council of Great Britain|PC]] (2 March 1705 &ndash; 20 March 1793) was a British [[barrister]], politician and judge noted for his reform of [[English law]]. Born to Scottish nobility, he was educated in [[Perth, Scotland]] before moving to London at the age of 13 to take up a place at [[Westminster School]]. He was accepted into [[Christ Church, Oxford]], in May 1723, and graduated four years later. Returning to London from Oxford, he was [[called to the Bar]] by [[Lincoln's Inn]] on 23 November 1730, and quickly gained a reputation as an excellent barrister.

He became involved in politics in 1742, beginning with his election as a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Boroughbridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Boroughbridge]], and appointment as [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]]. In the absence of a strong [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], he became the main spokesman for the government in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and was noted for his "great powers of eloquence" and described as "beyond comparison the best speaker" in the House of Commons.<ref name="hew13"/> With the promotion of [[Dudley Ryder (judge)|Sir Dudley Ryder]] to [[Lord Chief Justice]] in 1754, he became Attorney General, and when Ryder unexpectedly died several months later, he took his place as Chief Justice.

As Lord Chief Justice, Mansfield modernised both [[English law]] and the English courts system; he sped up the system for submitting [[Motion (legal)|motions]] and reformed the way judgments were given, in order to reduce the cost in time and money for the parties. For his work in ''[[Carter v Boehm]]'' and ''[[Pillans v Van Mierop]]'', he has been called the founder of English commercial law. He is perhaps best known for his judgment in [[Somersett's Case]], where he held that [[slavery]] was unlawful in England (although this did not end slave trafficking altogether).

==Early life and education==
William Murray was born on 2 March 1705, at [[Scone Palace]] in [[Perthshire]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], the fourth son of the [[David Murray, 5th Viscount of Stormont|5th Viscount of Stormont]] and his wife, Margaret, [[n<U+00E9>e]] Scott,<ref name="west">{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/william-murray,-lord-mansfield|title=William Murray, Lord Mansfield|publisher=[[Westminster Abbey]]|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref> and one of eleven children in total.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.wlu.edu/faculty/history/brockenbrough/mansfield.htm|title=William Murray (Lord Mansfield) 1705<U+2013>1793|publisher=[[Washington and Lee University]]|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref><ref name="shaw1">Shaw (1926) p.2</ref> Both his parents were strong supporters of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause,<ref name="hew1">Heward (1979) p.2</ref><ref name="p1">Plunkett (1956) p.248</ref> and his older brother [[James Murray (Jacobite)|James]] followed "[[James Francis Edward Stuart|The Old Pretender]]" into exile.<ref name="fif1">Fifoot (1936) p.27</ref> The Jacobite sympathies of Murray's family were glossed over by contemporaries, who even claimed that he had been educated at [[King Edward VI School (Lichfield)|Lichfield Grammar School]] with many other members of the English judiciary.<ref name="fif1"/> This was incorrect, and Murray was in fact educated at [[Perth Grammar School]],<ref name="shaw1"/> where he was taught [[Latin language|Latin]], English grammar, and essay writing skills.<ref name="hew1"/><ref name="foss1"/> He later said that this gave him a great advantage at university, as those students educated in England had been taught Greek and Latin, but not how to write properly in English.<ref name="hew2">Heward (1979) p.3</ref> While at Perth Grammar School, it became apparent that Murray was particularly intelligent, and in 1718, his father and older brother [[James Murray (Jacobite)|James]] decided to send him to [[Westminster School]], as James knew the Dean, [[Francis Atterbury]].<ref name="hew2"/> The distance from Perth to London was around {{convert|400|mi|km}}, and the journey took Murray 54 days.<ref name="cr1">Heward (1979) p.4</ref> Murray flourished at Westminster, and was made a [[King's Scholar]] on 21 May 1719.<ref name="cr1"/>

After an examination in May 1723, Murray was accepted into [[Christ Church, Oxford]], having scored higher in the examination than any other King's Scholar that year.<ref name="foss1"/><ref name="hew3">Heward (1979) p.7</ref> He was admitted as a [[commoner]] on 15 June 1723, and [[Matriculation|matriculated]] on 18 June; the records say that he came from [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] rather than Perth, because the person recording the names of the new students was unable to understand his Scottish accent.<ref name="hew3"/> James was a [[barrister]] in Scotland, and his family decided that a career as a barrister would be best for Murray. The Scottish [[Bar association|Bar]] at the time was overcrowded, which made it difficult for a young barrister to build a reputation, yet qualifying for the English Bar was extremely expensive.<ref name="hew4">Heward (1979) p.8</ref> Thanks to the patronage of [[Thomas Foley, 1st Baron Foley (1673<U+2013>1733)|Thomas Foley, 1st Baron Foley]], who gave Murray <U+00A3>200 a year to live on, Murray could afford to study at the bar, and became a member of [[Lincoln's Inn]] on 23 April 1724.<ref name="p1"/><ref name="hew4"/>

After [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] died on 11 June 1727, Murray entered and won a competition to write a Latin poem titled "The Death of the King".<ref name="hew5">Heward (1979) p.9</ref> His actions were seen as a show of support for the [[House of Hanover]] and the political ''[[status quo]]'', something odd considering the strong [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] sympathies of his family.<ref name="hew5"/> He probably did this because, having no private income, he wished to secure patronage to help him advance politically.<ref name="hew5"/> Another entrant was [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]], who was a constant rival to Murray until Pitt's death in 1778.<ref name="fif2">Fifoot (1936) p.28</ref> There is very little information about Murray's time at Oxford; it is known that he studied ancient and modern history, became fluent in French and gained a good understanding of [[Roman Law]].<ref name="hew6">Heward (1979) p.10</ref> He also became fluent in Latin, translating [[Cicero]]'s works into English and then back into Latin.<ref name="fif2"/> He gained his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1727, and travelled to London to train as a barrister.<ref name="hew6"/>

==At the English Bar==
Murray's first contact when he moved to London was William Hamilton, a Scottish-born barrister who was said to be the first Scot to practise at the English Bar, and one of the few people who was qualified to act as a barrister in both England and Scotland.<ref name="hew7">Heward (1979) p.12</ref> Hamilton had been one of Murray's sponsors when he joined Lincoln's Inn in 1724, and when Murray came to London, Hamilton helped find him a set of [[chambers (law)|chambers]] at No. 1 Old Square.<ref name="hew7"/><ref>Fifoot (1936) p.29</ref> At this time, there was no formal legal education, and the only requirement for a person to be [[called to the Bar]] was for him to have eaten five dinners a term at Lincoln's Inn, and to have read the first sentence of a paper prepared for him by the steward.<ref name="hew8">Heward (1979) p.13</ref> Thus, most of Murray's practical training came from reading the papers in Hamilton's chambers and listening to [[Robert Raymond, 1st Baron Raymond|Lord Raymond]] speak in court,<ref name="hew8"/> along with tutoring by [[Thomas Denison]] on how to write [[Special pleader|special pleadings]].<ref name="fif3"/> Murray also studied various texts, including the French ''Ordinance de la Marine'' (a predecessor to the [[Napoleonic code|Napoleonic Commercial Code]]), the works of [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]] and [[Thomas de Littleton|Littleton]] and "crabbed and uncouth compositions" on [[municipal law]].<ref name="fif3">Fifoot (1936) p.29</ref> 

Murray was called to the Bar on 23 November 1730, taking a set of chambers at 5 King's Bench Walk.<ref name="hew8"/> He was introduced to [[Alexander Pope]] around this time, and through his friendship with Pope met members of the aristocracy, some of whom later became his clients, including [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough]].<ref name="hew8"/> Pope also taught him [[orator]]y, something which helped him enormously in court.<ref name="hew8"/> His first two cases were in the English Court of Sessions in 1733, where he was lead by [[Charles Talbot, 1st Baron Talbot|Charles Talbot]] and opposed by [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke|Philip Yorke]].<ref name="fif4"/> The support of Talbot and Yorke allowed him to gain a respectable practice in the [[Court of Chancery]].<ref name="fif4">Fifoot (1936) p.34</ref> 

The 1707 [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] had merged the [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland]] into one national entity, but they retained separate legal systems. However, the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] became the highest court of appeal in both English and Scottish law, and as a result, 1707 Scottish cases on appeal from the [[Court of Session (Scotland)|Court of Session]] were sent there. To deal with these cases, a barrister had to be familiar with both [[Scottish Law|Scottish]] and [[English law]], and Murray found his niche, acting in Scottish cases in the House of Lords as early as 1733.<ref name="p2">Plunkett (1956) p.249</ref><ref name="hew9">Heward (1979) p.14</ref> His work in ''Moncrieff v Moncrieff'' in 1734 established Murray as a brilliant young barrister praised for his performance by Lords [[William Cowper, 1st Earl Cowper|Cowper]] and [[Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield|Parker]].<ref name="hew9"/> After ''Moncrieff'', Murray was involved in almost every case in the House of Lords, whether it had been appealed from a Scottish court or not.<ref name="hew9"/><ref name="foss2">Foss (1870) p.470</ref>
[[File:IMG 6721.JPG|thumb|right|Elizabeth Finch, wife of William Murray]]
In 1737, Murray acted as Counsel for the [[City of Edinburgh]] in the aftermath of the death of [[Captain John Porteous]]. In Edinburgh, it was traditional for criminals sentenced to death to be allowed to visit a church near the city jail the Sunday before the execution. Two criminals named Wilson and Robertson took this as an opportunity to escape, and although Wilson did not make it out of the church, Robertson escaped completely.<ref name="hew10">Heward (1979) p.15</ref> Wilson had been a smuggler who supplied his fellow citizens with goods, and because of this and the unpopularity of the city guard, public opinion was firmly on his side. Porteous was the captain of the Edinburgh city guard, and angry with Wilson's attempt to escape and aware of the possibility of an attempt to free him. Porteous ordered a guard of 80 men to be placed around the gallows for Wilson's execution.<ref name="hew10"/> When a man attempted to cut Wilson's body down after the execution Porteous ordered his troops to fire on the crowd, and seven people were killed.<ref name="hew10"/> Porteous was initially sentenced to death for murder, and when the execution was delayed, a mob of citizens rushed the city jail and [[lynched]] him.<ref name="hew10"/>

As a result a bill was proposed in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that sought to punish the City of Edinburgh for the behaviour of its citizens by [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchising]] the city.<ref name="hew11">Heward (1979) p.20</ref> Murray represented the City in both the House of Commons and the [[House of Lords]], and eventually whittled down the bill so much that by the time it was voted on it was simply a proposal to fine the city and disqualify the [[Provost (civil)|Provost]].<ref name="hew11"/> In exchange for his work the citizens of Edinburgh gave him the [[Freedom of the City]] and a diamond, which is still in the possession of his family.<ref name="foss2"/><ref name="hew11"/> Murray's reputation continued to grow; in 1738, he was involved in 11 of the 16 cases heard in the House of Lords, and in 1739 and 1740 he acted as legal counsel in 30 cases there.<ref>Heward (1979) p.23</ref>

On 20 September 1738, he married Lady Elizabeth Finch, the daughter of [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham]], at [[Raby Castle]] in [[Durham]].<ref name="hew12">Heward (1979) p.24</ref> Her sister Mary was married to [[Thomas Watson-Wentworth, 1st Marquess of Rockingham]], and Murray's connection with the Marquess was to have a significant impact on his future career.<ref name="hew12"/> After a short holiday, Murray returned to his work as a barrister.<ref name="hew12"/>

==Member of Parliament==
Murray had repeatedly refused to become a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]], saying he had no interest in politics.<ref name="hew13">Heward (1979) p.30</ref> In 1742, however, the government of [[Robert Walpole|Sir Robert Walpole]] fell, and Murray's father-in-law, the Earl of Nottingham, became [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] in the new [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]. With this added political influence, Murray hoped to be appointed to a government office, and when [[John Strange (English politician)|Sir John Strange]] resigned as [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]], Murray was made a Member of Parliament for [[Boroughbridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Boroughbridge]] on 15 December 1742 and immediately succeeded Strange as Solicitor General.<ref name="p2"/><ref name="hew13"/> Although the Solicitor General was the lowest legal appointment, a successful one could be appointed [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], and by custom, the Attorney General was allowed to become [[Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench]] if a vacancy arose.<ref name="hew13"/> Although many barristers were not good politicians, Murray became a successful Member of Parliament, and one noted for his oratorical skills and logical arguments.<ref name="hew13"/><ref name="foss2"/> 

In 1745, Murray defended the actions of the government in hiring 16,000 [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanoverian]] troops to help fight in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].<ref name="hew14">Heward (1979) p.31</ref> His argument (that it was the prerogative of the King to decide how a war should be fought, and he should not be second-guessed by politicians with no experience of warfare) defeated the motion to cease employing the Hanoverian troops by 231 votes to 181.<ref name="hew14"/> Murray became popular with both the government and [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] as a result, and in the absence of a strong Attorney General, Murray spoke for the government in most matters.<ref name="hew14"/> In 1747, he helped [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke|Lord Hardwicke]] write and pass an act to abolish the old hereditary positions in Scotland.<ref name="hew14"/> In 1751 he drafted the government response to an attempt by the King of [[Prussia]] to frustrate neutral shipping, which [[William Scott, 1st Baron Stowell|Lord Stowell]] called "the foundation of the modern law of neutrality", and [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] described it as a "r<U+00E9>sponse sans <U+00E9>plique" (response without a reply).<ref name="fif5">Fifoot (1936) p.37</ref>

The death of [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Frederick]], the heir to the British throne on 20 March 1751, caused constitutional chaos; George II wished to appoint his favourite son [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland]], as Regent (since the heir apparent, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], was only a child), while the public favoured the child's mother [[Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha|Princess Augusta]].<ref name="hew15">Heward (1979) p.33</ref> In an attempt to reach a compromise the government introduced a bill to Parliament declaring that Augusta was to be a regent along with a council of others, and that George would become the heir when he reached maturity.<ref name="hew15"/> Murray made a speech supporting the government's proposal, but despite this, Parliament was not convinced that a council was necessary.<ref name="hew15"/>

On 6 March 1754, the Prime Minister [[Henry Pelham]] died, and this necessitated a [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] reshuffle. The [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], [[Dudley Ryder (judge)|Sir Dudley Ryder]], became [[Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench]], and Murray became Attorney General in his place.<ref name="foss2"/><ref name="p2"/><ref name="hew16">Heward (1979) p.40</ref> A few months later the [[Master of the Rolls]] died, and Murray was asked to replace him; he declined, however, as he "did not want to leave His Majesty's service".<ref name="hew16"/> After Ryder died unexpectedly on 25 May 1756, however, Murray could not turn down the opportunity, and immediately applied to replace him as Lord Chief Justice.<ref name="p2"/><ref name="hew16"/>

He was accepted, and although his appointment delighted Murray, the government was very concerned at the loss of a good Attorney General.<ref name="hew17">Heward (1979) p.42</ref> In an attempt to persuade him to stay, the new Prime Minister, the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Duke of Newcastle]] offered him the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], in addition to the position of Attorney General, an extra <U+00A3>6,000 a year, and a pension, and finally attempted to blackmail him by saying that if he accepted the office of Lord Chief Justice, the government would refuse to grant him a [[peerage]].<ref name="hew17"/> It was customary for all Lord Chief Justices to be given a peerage, and Murray responded by saying that in that situation he would refuse to become either Lord Chief Justice or Attorney General.<ref name="hew17"/> Newcastle gave in, and promised to allow him to become Lord Chief Justice and to recommend him for a peerage.<ref name="hew17"/>

This was seen as an excellent result by Murray, who had no interest in politics except as a stepping stone to become a member of the judiciary.<ref name="fif5"/> Murray was not suited to politics, as he was far too calculating and independent of thought to accept any one party's doctrine.<ref name="fif6">Fifoot (1936) p.38</ref> His Scottish and Jacobite roots also allowed for endless insinuation and controversy&mdash;in 1753 he was accused by the Bishop of Gloucester of "having drunk the health of the [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Old Pretender]] on his knees".<ref name="fif6"/> Although the story was proven to be false it embarrassed Murray, and was used to taunt him as late as 1770.<ref name="fif6"/> His rivalry with [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] highlighted his unsuitability for politics - unlike other politicians such as [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke|Philip Yorke]] and [[Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow|Edward Thurlow]] he did not have the temperament to resist "the vehemence of Pitt's invective".<ref name="fif6"/> It was widely felt that he could have become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] after the death of [[Henry Pelham]], but it would have "set [his genius] in a false environment", and he declined all opportunities to return to politics except as Lord Chief Justice.<ref>Fifoot (1936) p.38</ref>

==Lord Chief Justice==
[[File:Mansfield Old.jpg|thumb|left|Murray in his official robes as Lord Chief Justice]]
Anyone wishing to become a judge was required to be a [[Serjeant-at-law]], which Murray was not; as such, he left [[Lincoln's Inn]] to join [[Serjeant's Inn]].<ref name="hew18">Heward (1979) p.45</ref> He qualified as a Serjeant-at-law on 8 November 1756, and was sworn in as Lord Chief Justice at the house of the [[Lord Chancellor]] that evening.<ref name="hew18"/> Immediately afterwards he was created Baron Mansfield.<ref name="hew18"/> On 19 November, he was sworn in as a [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Counsellor]].<ref name="odnb">{{cite web|url=http://oxforddnb.com/view/article/19655?docPos=6|title=Oxford DNB article: Murray, William (subscription needed)|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2009-03-02}}</ref> He suspended his duties temporarily on 5 April 1757, when he was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], due to an old custom which said that the Lord Chief Justice took the position when it was empty. He only served until 8 April, and there is no evidence of his performing anything more than the standard day-to-day duties.<ref name="hew18"/> He became a cabinet minister in 1757, still serving as Lord Chief Justice, and stayed until 1765.<ref>Fifoot (1936) p.40</ref>

===Reform===
Mansfield first sat in court on 11 November 1756, and at the time had "a very low estimate of the Common Law of England which he was to administer".<ref>Lowry (1973) p.605</ref> The legal system had been put together in the period immediately after the [[Norman conquest of England]], and was completely unsuited to the 18th century, when Britain was "the greatest manufacturing and commercial country in the world".<ref>Lowry (1973) p.606</ref> Mansfield immediately began to reform the way the law and courts worked, and one of his first acts as Lord Chief Justice was to change the system for submitting [[Motion (legal)|motions]].<ref name="hew19">Heward (1979) p.46</ref> Every day the court was in session, all barristers were invited to submit motions, in order of their seniority as barristers.<ref name="hew19"/> Because they were allowed to submit as many motions as they wanted, by the time junior [[barrister]]s were allowed to submit, their motions it was normally the end of the day.<ref name="hew19"/> This meant that almost all the work went to the senior barristers, who were so overworked that they often did not have time to prepare properly before going to court.<ref name="hew19"/> In addition it meant that work for junior barristers was scarce, hindering their careers.<ref name="hew19"/> Mansfield changed the system so that barristers were only allowed to submit one motion a day, and that if not all barristers had been heard by the end of the day, they would continue where they left off the next morning.<ref name="hew19"/>

At the time it was also traditional for all judgments to be [[Reserved decision|reserved]].<ref name="hew19"/> Although in a small number of cases this was useful, in the majority of cases it simply made coming to court more expensive and wasted time.<ref name="hew19"/> As soon as Mansfield became Lord Chief Justice he changed the rules so that unless the court had doubts over the evidence presented to them, a judgment was to be made immediately.<ref name="hew19"/> This had a far-reaching effect on the English courts, and judges from the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] and [[High Court of Justice]] now only give reserved judgments in a minority of cases.<ref>Heward (1979) p.47</ref> His reforms led to the Court of King's Bench becoming one of the most active courts, at the expense of the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], which was described as the "sleepy hollow".<ref>Baker (2002) p.50</ref>

===Mercantile law changes===
In the eighteenth century, English [[commercial law|merchant law]] was still based on the ''[[Lex mercatoria]]'', a medieval series of customs and principles used to regulate trading.<ref name="hew20">Heward (1979) p.99</ref> Other countries in Europe had reformed and modernised their law, and the result of this was that English merchant law was about a century behind the merchant law of other European countries.<ref name="hew20"/> A merchant was, by his very nature, international, and the inconsistencies between English law and the law of other nations made business difficult.<ref name="hew20"/>

Mansfield made a great effort to bring English merchant law up to the same standards as that of other European nations, defining his position by saying that "the daily negotiations and property of merchants ought not to depend on subtleties and niceties, but upon rules easily learned and easily retained because they are dictates of common sense drawn from the truth of the case".<ref name="hew21">Heward (1979) p.101</ref> In most European countries, the principle was that a merchant was bound by his promises, not just his signed legal documents, while English lawyers maintained that a merchant could only be legally bound by documents that he signed.<ref name="hew21"/> The European principle was based on the assumption of good faith on the part of the merchants, or ''[[uberrima fides]]'', something completely lacking in English law.<ref name="hew21"/> In ''[[Carter v Boehm]]'' [[Oxford Standard for Citation Of Legal Authorities|[1766] 3 Burr 1905]] Mansfield got a chance to reform the law relating to the assumption of good faith. Carter was the Governor of [[Fort Marlborough]] (now [[Bengkulu]]), which was built by the [[British East India Company]] in [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]].<ref name="hew22">Heward (1979) p.102</ref> He took out an insurance policy with Boehm against the fort's being taken by a foreign enemy.<ref name="hew22"/> A witness called Captain Tryon testified that Carter knew the fort was built to resist attacks from natives but not European enemies, and the French were likely to attack. The French did attack, and Boehm refused to fulfil the insurance claim.<ref name="hew22"/>

Mansfield decided in favour of Boehm, saying that Carter had failed his duty of ''uberrima fides''. In his judgment Mansfield said that:<blockquote>
Insurance is a contract based upon speculation. The special facts, upon which the contingent chance is to be computed, lie most commonly in the knowledge of the insured only; the underwriter trusts to his representation and proceeds upon the confidence that he does not keep back any circumstance in his knowledge, to mislead the underwriter into a belief that the circumstance does not exist, and to induce him to estimate the risque as if it did not exist. Good faith forbids either party by concealing what he privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary.<ref name="hew23">Heward (1979) p.103</ref></blockquote> This was an attempt by Mansfield to introduce the assumption of good faith into English law,<ref name="hew23"/> and although it failed for the most part (as most areas of English commercial law no longer use ''uberrima fides'') it is still used in insurance contracts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldjudgmt/jd010118/manife-1.htm|title=House of Lords - Manifest Shipping Company Limited v.

In the earlier case of ''[[Pillans v Van Mierop|Pillans & Rose v Van Mierop & Hopkins]]'' [1765] 3 Burr 1663, Mansfield had attempted to challenge the doctrine of [[Consideration in English law|Consideration]].<ref name="hew24">Heward (1979) p.104</ref> In English law, Consideration is a vital part of the contract; without valid consideration, almost any contract is void.<ref>McKendrick (2007) p.87</ref> However Mansfield argued in his judgment that it should only be treated as evidence of a contract, not as a vital element.<ref name="hew24"/> Mansfield failed to make clear that he was referring only to consideration in commercial contracts, not general contracts, and as a result his judgment read that consideration was not required for ''any'' contract.<ref name="hew24"/> His judgment has been much criticised by legal academics,<ref name="hew24"/> and was effectively overruled by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''Rann v Hughes'' [1778] 7 T. R. 350. 

Mansfield also enforced a previous judgement of the Court of King's Bench made in 1645, in which they allowed a special jury of merchants to sit in cases involving commercial law.<ref name="law1">Lowry (1973) p.609</ref> He built up a special corps of these jurymen, some of whom such as [[Edward Vaux]] became noted experts on commercial law, and "Lord Mansfield's jurymen" acted as an effective liaison between the merchants and the courts.<ref name="law1"/> Mansfield was personally a supporter of [[free trade]] who was heavily influenced by [[Roman law]] and ancient Roman and Greek writers such as [[Cicero]] and [[Xenophon]].<ref name="law1"/>

===Copyright law===
Mansfield made another notable judgment in ''[[Millar v Taylor]]'' [1769] KB, in relation to copyright law.<ref name="hew25"/> [[Andrew Millar]] was a bookseller who in 1729 had purchased the publishing rights to [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]]'s poem "The Seasons". After the term of the exclusive rights granted under the [[Statute of Anne]] expired, Robert Taylor began publishing his own competing publication, which contained Thomson's poem. Mansfield, sitting with three other judges, concluded that despite the Statute of Anne there was a perpetual [[common law copyright]], and therefore that no works can ever be considered [[public domain]].<ref name="hew25">Heward (1979) p.105</ref> This was a massive victory for booksellers and publishers, as it meant that they could effectively make it impossible for new companies to compete, as in the absence of new texts there was nothing they could print.<ref name="hew25"/> Mansfield's judgment was finally overruled by the House of Lords in ''[[Donaldson v Beckett]]'' in 1774.<ref name="hew25"/> Mansfield's judgment has been criticised as being unusually short-sighted because he failed to see that while his decision was correct for that particular case, the precedent it would set would create an unfair monopoly for the booksellers and publishers.<ref name="hew25"/> This was one of only a small number of cases in which Mansfield was overruled; in his entire career only six of his judgments were overturned by a higher court.<ref name="penn">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.upenn.edu/about/history/medallions/mansfield/index.html|title=History of Penn Law - medallions and inscriptions|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref> Mansfield's judgement here has been seen as part of a wider agenda; along with other legal figures such as [[William Blackstone|Sir William Blackstone]] he was personally in favour of a perpetual copyright.<ref>Cornish (2009) p.9</ref>

===Junius===
In 1695 Parliament failed to renew the [[Licensing Order of 1643|Licensing Acts]], and as a result, the press were free to print material attacking the government.<ref name="hew26">Heward (1979) p.125</ref> Although there were eight attempts to force a new Licensing Act through Parliament between 1697 and 1713, none of them succeeded.<ref name="hew26"/> Despite the freedom of the press from censorship by the government, the judiciary held a different view, and regularly tried people for [[seditious libel]] if they printed material attacking the government.<ref>Heward (1979) p.126</ref> From 21 November 1768, letters written by a man under the pseudonym of [[Junius]] were published in the ''[[Public Advertiser]]'', a London newspaper run by [[Henry Sampson Woodfall]].<ref name="hew27">Heward (1979) p.127</ref> In them, Junius attacked many political leaders, including [[John Manners, Marquess of Granby|Lord Granby]] and Mansfield. His letters were wildly popular, and the circulation of the ''Public Advertiser'' doubled in just five months.<ref name="hew27"/>

On 19 December 1769, Junius wrote a letter attacking the King, and incensed at this, the government ordered several people to be arrested and tried for seditious libel, including Woodfall for publishing the letters, [[John Almon]] for selling them, and John Miller for republishing them.<ref name="hew27"/> Almon's case was heard at [[Westminster Hall]] by Mansfield and a jury on 2 June 1770, and he was found guilty. Woodfall was tried on 13 June 1770, by Mansfield and a jury. While Mansfield believed that the language used was libellous the jury, disagreed, and held that he was "guilty of printing and publishing only", and innocent of seditious libel.<ref name="hew28">Heward (1979) p.128</ref> Miller was tried on 13 July 1770, and after six hours of discussion the jury found him innocent.<ref name="hew28"/> As a result of these two trials, it became clear that no jury would convict a printer for printing these letters, leaving Junius free to continue sending his letters.<ref name="hew28"/>

On 14 November 1770, a letter by Junius directed at Mansfield was published by the Public Advertiser and the ''[[London Evening Post]]'', a newspaper run by John Miller.<ref name="hew29">Heward (1979) p.129</ref> In it, Junius attacked Mansfield, first for being Scottish, then for being a lapsed [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]], and finally for attempting to suppress the freedom of the press.<ref name="hew29"/> Although the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], [[William de Grey, 1st Baron Walsingham|William de Grey]], advised that the publishers should again be prosecuted, Mansfield disagreed, saying that if they failed to respond to Junius, he would become bored and stop writing.<ref name="hew29"/> Mansfield was evidently correct, because other than a letter printed on 5 October 1771, Junius ceased to write at the beginning of 1772.<ref name="hew29"/>

===Somersett's Case===
[[Image:FrancisHargrave.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Hargrave]], who represented James Somersett in this case]]
Mansfield is best known for his judgment in [[Somersett's Case]] on the legality of keeping [[slave]]s.<ref name="hew30">Heward (1979) p.139</ref><ref name="foss3"/> The English had been involved in the slave trade since 1553, and by 1768, ships registered in Liverpool, Bristol and London carried more than half the slaves shipped in the world.<ref name="hew30"/> [[James Somersett]] was a slave owned by Charles Stewart, an American customs officer who sailed to Britain for business, landing on 10 November 1769.<ref name="hew30"/> A few days later Somersett attempted to escape. He was recaptured in November and imprisoned on the ship ''Ann and Mary'', owned by Captain John Knowles and bound for the British colony of [[Jamaica]].<ref name="hew30"/> However, three people claiming to be Somersett's godparents, John Marlow, Thomas Walkin and Elizabeth Cade, made an application before the Court of King's Bench for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and Captain Knowles was ordered to produce Somersett before the Court of King's Bench, which would determine whether his imprisonment was legal.<ref name="hew30"/>

Mansfield ordered a hearing for 22 January 1772. In fact, following an adjournment, it was not until 7 February 1772, that the case was heard.<ref name="hew30"/> In the meantime, the case had attracted a great deal of attention in the press, and members of the public were forthcoming with donations to fund lawyers for both sides of the argument.<ref name="hew31">Heward (1979) p.140</ref> An activist layman, [[Granville Sharp]], who continually sought test cases against the legal justifications for slavery, was Somersett's real backer, and when the case was heard, no fewer than five advocates appeared for the slave, speaking at three separate hearings between February and May.<ref name="hew31"/> These lawyers included [[William Davy]] [[Serjeant-at-law|SL]], [[John Glynn]] SL,<ref name="vc1">Van Cleve (2006) p.2</ref> [[James Mansfield]] and [[Francis Hargrave]], who was later to become a noted barrister based on his work in this case.<ref name="hew31"/> Charles Stewart was represented by [[John Dunning, 1st Baron Ashburton|John Dunning]] and [[James Wallace (MP)|James Wallace]].<ref name="vc1"/>

On behalf of Somersett, it was argued that while colonial laws might permit slavery, neither the common law of England, nor any law made by [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] recognised the existence of slavery, and slavery was therefore illegal.<ref name="hew31"/> Moreover, English contract law did not allow for any person to enslave himself, nor could any contract be binding without the person's consent. The arguments thus focused on legal details rather than humanitarian principles.<ref name="hew31"/> In actual fact, a law passed in 1765 said that all lands, forts and slaves owned by the Africa Company were a property of the Crown, which could be interpreted to mean that the Crown accepted slavery.<ref name="hew31"/> When the two lawyers for Charles Stewart put their case, they argued that a contract for the sale of a slave was recognised in England, and therefore the existence of slaves must be legally valid.<ref name="hew31"/>

After the attorneys for both sides had given their arguments Mansfield called a recess, saying that "[the case] required ... [a] consultation ... among the twelve Judges".<ref>Van Cleve (2006) p.3</ref> Finally, on 22 June 1772 Mansfield gave his judgment, which ruled that a master could not carry his slave out of England by force, and concluded:

<blockquote>
The state of slavery is of such a nature, that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political; but only positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory: it's so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from a decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.<ref name="hew32">Heward (1979) p.141</ref>
</blockquote>

This was not an end to slavery, as this only abolished it in England and Wales, not in the rest of the [[British Empire]].<ref name="hew32"/> As a result of Mansfield's decision between 14,000 and 15,000 slaves were immediately freed, some of whom remained with their masters as paid employees.<ref name="hew32"/> The decision was apparently not immediately followed; Africans were still hunted and kidnapped in London, Liverpool and Bristol to be sold elsewhere, and Mansfield was so uncertain about how it would be applied that he specified in his will that his "[[mulatto]]" great-niece [[Dido Elizabeth Belle]] was to be considered a free woman.<ref name="hew32"/> In addition there are advertisements from the time showing that slaves were still bought and sold in England, and Mansfield himself referred to slaves in his judgment in a later case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/rights/slave_free.htm|title=The National Archives - Exhibitions - Black presence - rights|publisher=[[The National Archives]]|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref> Although slavery was not completely abolished in the British Empire until 1834, Mansfield's decision is considered to have been a significant step in recognising the illegality of slavery.<ref name="hew32"/>

==House of Lords==
After the formation of the [[Fox-North Coalition]], Mansfield agreed to act as [[Speaker of the House of Lords]], taking up his post in February 1783.<ref name="hew33">Heward (1979) p.162</ref> The main item of debate during the Coalition Ministry was the [[East India Bill]], which provoked bitter arguments in both the [[House of Lords]] and [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].<ref name="hew33"/> In an attempt to speed up the process of passing the bill, Mansfield left his position as Speaker to debate directly on 15 December; when this failed to help he returned to the [[Woolsack]] the next day.<ref name="hew33"/> The failure of the bill caused the government to be immediately dismissed, and Mansfield left his position on 23 December 1783.<ref name="hew33"/>

Mansfield had been made Earl of Mansfield, in the County of Nottingham, on 31 October 1776. He attended the Lords as Lord Speaker, and the last record of him attending (other than his presence at the state opening of Parliament on 23 March 1784)<ref name="hew34">Heward (1979) p.163</ref> was in December 1783.<ref>Fifoot (1936) p.46</ref>

==Retirement==
[[File:1stLordKenyon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lloyd Kenyon, 1st Baron Kenyon|Lloyd Kenyon]], who succeeded Murray as Lord Chief Justice]]
Despite failing health, Mansfield refused to officially leave his post as Lord Chief Justice because [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] was opposed to the appointment of Mansfield's prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> [[Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet|Francis Buller]] to the position after Mansfield resigned.<ref name="odnb"/><ref name="foss4">Foss (1870) p.472</ref> The government of the time instead suggested [[Lloyd Kenyon, 1st Baron Kenyon|Lloyd Kenyon]] as a possible successor, and Mansfield clung to office until 1788, (despite not sitting in court for two years) in the hope that the government would fall before he was forced to retire.<ref name="hew35">Heward (1979) p.166</ref> This was not to be, and on 3 June, he wrote a letter of resignation effective the next day.<ref name="p2"/><ref name="hew35"/>

After his retirement, Mansfield spent the remainder of his life at [[Kenwood House]].<ref name="hew36">Heward (1979) p.168</ref> Most of this time was spent maintaining the grounds, although in the summer, groups of [[barrister]]s would visit him and inform him of the goings-on at court.<ref name="hew36"/> On 1 August 1792 he was made Earl of Mansfield, in the County of [[Middlesex]].<ref>Heward (1979) p.161</ref> On 10 March 1793, he complained of feeling sleepy, and although he recovered the next day, by 12 March, he was again complaining of a need for sleep.<ref name="hew36"/> He went to bed early and remained asleep until 18 March, when he finally died.<ref name="hew36"/> His body was buried in the North [[Transept]] of [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref name="west"/> Mansfield left a large amount of money after his death, including land worth <U+00A3>26,000. He gave <U+00A3>2,000 to [[Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet|Francis Buller]].<ref>Fifoot (1936) p.50</ref> In 1801 a monument to him was made out of marble by [[John Flaxman]]; it shows Murray flanked by the personifications of [[Wisdom]] and [[Lady Justice|Justice]],<ref name="west"/> with an inscription that reads:

{{Quote|"'''Here Murray long enough his country<U+2019>s pride is now no more than [[Cicero|Tully]] or than [[Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon|Hyde]]'. Foretold by [[Alexander Pope|Ar. Pope]] and fulfilled in the year 1793 when William Earl of Mansfield died full of years and of honours: of honours he declined many: those which he accepted were the following: he was appointed Solicitor General 1742, Attorney General 1754, Lord Chief Justice and Baron Mansfield 1756, Earl of Mansfield 1776. From the love which he bore to the place of his early education, he desired to be buried in this cathedral (privately) and would have forbidden that instance of human vanity, the erecting a monument to his memory, but a sum which with the interest has amounted to two thousand five hundred pounds was left for that purpose by A.Bailey Esqr. of Lyon<U+2019>s Inn, which at least well meant mark of esteem he had no previous knowledge or suspicion of and had no power to prevent being executed. He was the fourth son of David, fifth Viscount Stormont, and married the Lady Elizabeth Finch, daughter to Daniel, Earl of Nottingham by whom he had no issue. Born at Scone 2nd March 1704. Died at Kenwood 20th March 1793.''"<ref name="west"/>
}}

==Legacy==
[[English law]] saw significant changes during Mansfield's career.<ref name="hew37">Heward (1979) p.170</ref> As Lord Chief Justice, Mansfield had done much to reform the way the courts worked, making it easier for people to gain access to legal aid, and also making the process much less expensive.<ref name="hew37"/> He was also noted for his insistence that [[equity (law)|equity]] should be applied by all courts, not just the [[Court of Chancery]], a view that provoked much disagreement during his lifetime, but which was eventually confirmed by Parliament in the [[Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873]], which allowed all courts to take cases of equity.<ref name="hew37"/> He also established the principle that rather than blindly following precedent, judges should seek to find loopholes in rules that were no longer applicable, something that later received the support of [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], who said, "It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is more revolting still if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past."<ref name="hew38">Heward (1979) p.171</ref> He made his judgements on the principle that "as the usages of society alter, the law must adapt itself to the various situations of mankind", leading [[John Baker (legal historian)|John Baker]] to describe him as "one of the boldest of judicial spirits".<ref>Baker (2002) p.200</ref>

[[Image:BullerFrancis.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Sir [[Francis Buller]], who Mansfield tried to make [[Lord Chief Justice]] after his retirement.]]
His most important contributions were to commercial, merchant and common law.<ref name="hew38"/> Mansfield spent much time bringing the law of England on par with that of other countries, particularly in cases such as ''[[Pillans v Van Mierop|Pillans & Rose v Van Mierop & Hopkins]]'' [1765] 3 Burr 1663, and ''[[Carter v Boehm]]'' [1766] 3 Burr 1905.<ref name="hew38"/> As a result of his work, he was described by a later judge as "the founder of the commercial law of this country".<ref name="hew25"/><ref name="foss3">Foss (1870) p.471</ref>

He was, however, criticised for his resistance to the [[freedom of the press]] and his refusal to go against the King,<ref name="odnb"/> as well as for his blatant [[nepotism]] which was highlighted in his attempts to have [[Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet|Francis Buller]] made [[Lord Chief Justice]] after his retirement.<ref name="foss1"/> He was also criticised as a politician for his support of a government antagonistic to the colonies; in 1829 [[John Quincy Adams]] described him as "more responsible for the [[American Revolution|Revolution]] than any other man".<ref>Waterman (1934) p.552</ref> Scholars such as [[John Chipman Gray]] have questioned his reputation as a universally successful judge, saying that "the reputation of Lord Mansfield as a commercial lawyer should not blind us to the fact that he was not equally great in the law of [[real property]]".<ref>Waterman (1934) p.557</ref>

Opinion over Mansfield's intention in his ruling in [[Somerset's Case]] is mixed, with the current prevailing view being that he did not actually intend to free the slaves.<ref>Van Cleve (2006) p.1</ref> The judgment was particularly narrow, as it only ruled that a master could not carry his slave out of England by force, not that slaves who came to England were emancipated. This is seen as particularly telling because this was the primary argument of Davy and Hargrave.<ref name="vc2">Van Cleve (2006) p.4</ref> If Murray had wanted to emancipate the slaves completely there were various bits of judicial precedent he could have based his decision on, such as ''Smith v Gould'' or ''Shanley v Harvey'', but he did not.<ref name="vc2"/> Various comments he made before and during the case also suggest that complete emancipation was not his intent; when opening the case he wrote "the setting 14,000 or
15,000 men at once free loose by a solemn opinion, is much disagreeable in the effect it threatens<U+201D>, which [[Alan Watson]] interprets, along with Murray's attempts at putting off the case by holding multiple sessions, as indicative of his reluctance to make a decision for fear of economic consequences.<ref>Watson (2006) p.3</ref> Various comments he made to Thomas Hutchinson in private letters, along with his comments about the ''Somersett'' decision in ''R. v Inhabitants of Thames Ditton'' also suggest that emancipation was not his aim.<ref>Van Ceve (2006) p.6</ref>

==Character==
Mansfield was noted at the [[Barristers in England and Wales|Bar]], in Parliament, and while sitting as a judge, for his eloquence and skill as a speaker; in particular [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]] described him as "beyond comparison the best speaker" in the House of Commons.<ref name="hew13"/> He was also a hard worker; he would sometimes do court paperwork himself, as well as do his judicial duties, in an attempt to speed up the legal process.<ref name="hew39">Heward (1979) p.178</ref> He was summarised by [[Gareth Jones (lawyer)|Gareth Jones]] as "Conservative, urbane, silver-tongued, energetic, cultivated and well read; a highly imaginative lawyer who looked to reason and was not overawed by the legacy of the past".<ref>Jones (198) p.374</ref> [[Edmund Burke]], a contemporary, said that "he had some superiors in force, some equals in persuasion; but in ''insinuation'' he was without a rival. He excelled in the statement of a case. This, of itself, was worth the argument of any other man".<ref>Fifoot (1936) p.33</ref> The comment by [[Samuel Johnson]] that "Much may be made of a [Scotsman], if he be caught young" was directed at Mansfield,<ref>Jones (198) p.373</ref> and Johnson also described him as "more than a mere lawyer", while [[Edward Coke]], who is considered one of the most important lawyers in the history of English law, was "only a lawyer".<ref>Jones (198) p.375</ref> Due to his reputation as a barrister [[Lincoln's Inn]] offer a series of scholarship for the [[Bar Vocational Course]] named the Lord Mansfield Scholarship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/article5309424.ece|title=Inns of Court Scholarships|date=8 December 2008|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref>

Unlike other barristers, Mansfield was noted for always keeping a cool head and being "prudent to the point of timidity".<ref name="fif5"/> He was criticised for being "moderate and dispassionate", unlike more aggressive barristers such as [[Edward Coke]]; when asked about this he replied that "I would not have made Sir Edward Coke's speech to gain all Sir Edward Coke's estates and all his reputation".<ref name="fif5"/> There are conflicting reports about his temperament and attitude as a judge; [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] described him as "a very bad judge, proud, haughty to the Bar and hasty in his determinations", and [[Charles Yorke]] said he was "offensive and unpopular".<ref name="fif7">Fifoot (1936) p.48</ref> Both opinions are suspect, however; Pitt's because he was a constant rival to Mansfield and Yorke's because he was attempting to beat Mansfield to the position of [[Lord Chancellor]] at the time.<ref name="fif7"/> [[Edward Foss]] said that "there has never been a judge more venerated by his contemporaries, nor whose memory is regarded with greater respect and affection", and described him as "the great oracle of law".<ref name="foss1">Foss (1870) p.469</ref> He has been called "the legal genius of his genaration",<ref name="les"/> and compared favourably with [[Joseph Story]], a judge of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] noted for his brilliance.<ref name="les">Leslie (1957) p.279</ref> Other Americans such as Julian S. Waterman, the founder of the [[University of Arkansas School of Law]], described him as "not only the greatest common law judge but the greatest judge in Anglo-American legal history", while Joseph Story himself said that Mansfield "broke down the narrow barrier of the common law, redeemed it from feudal selfishness and barbarity" and that "he was one of those great men raised up by Providence, at a fortunate moment, to effect a salutary revolution in the world".<ref>Waterman (1934) p.549</ref>
