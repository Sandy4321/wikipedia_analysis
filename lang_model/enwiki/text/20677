The '''Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway''' {{reporting mark|ATSF}}, often abbreviated as '''Santa Fe''', was one of the largest [[List of United States railroads|railroads in the United States]]. The company was first chartered in February, [[1859]]. Although the railway was named in part for the capital of [[New Mexico]], its main line never reached there as the terrain made it too difficult to lay the necessary tracks ([[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] was ultimately served by a [[branch line]] from [[Lamy, New Mexico]]). The Santa Fe's first tracks reached the [[Kansas]]/[[Colorado]] state line in [[1873]], and connected to [[Pueblo, Colorado]] in [[1876]]. In order to help fuel the railroad's profitability, the Santa Fe set up [[real estate]] offices and sold [[farm]] land from the land grants that the railroad was awarded by [[United States Congress|Congress]]; these new farms would create a demand for transportation (both freight and passenger service) that was, quite conveniently, offered by the Santa Fe.

Ever the innovator, Santa Fe was one of the pioneers in intermodal freight service, an enterprise that (at one time or another) included a tugboat fleet and an airline, the short-lived '''Santa Fe Skyway'''. A bus line allowed the company to extend passenger transportation service to areas not accessible by rail, and ferry boats on the San Francisco Bay allowed travellers to complete their westward journeys all the way to the Pacific Ocean. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway officially ceased operations on December 31, 1996 when it merged with the [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] to form the [[Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway]].

==History==
[[Image:Cyrus K Holliday.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Cyrus K. Holliday]], the first president of the railroad.]]
===Startup and initial growth===
The railroad's charter, written single-handedly by [[Cyrus K. Holliday]] in January [[1859]], was approved by the state's governor on [[February 11]] of that year as the '''Atchison and Topeka Railroad Company''' for the purpose of building a rail line from [[Topeka, Kansas]], to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], and then on to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. On [[May 3]], [[1863]], two years after Kansas gained statehood, the railroad changed names to more closely match the aspirations of its founder to the '''Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad'''. The railroad broke ground in Topeka on [[October 30]], [[1868]] and started building westward where one of the first construction tasks was to cross the [[Kaw River]]. The first section of track opened on [[April 26]], [[1869]] (less than a month prior to completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]) with special trains between Topeka and [[Pauline, Kansas|Pauline]]. The distance was only 6 [[mile]]s (10 [[kilometre|km]]), but the ''[[Wakarusa Creek Picnic Special]]'' train took passengers over the route for celebration in Pauline.

[[Image:Santa Fe Route.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Santa Fe trademark in the late 1800s incorporated the [[United Kingdom|British]] lion out of respect for the country's financial assistance in building the railroad to California.]]
Crews continued working westward, reaching [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]] on [[September 5]] [[1872]]. With this connection, the Santa Fe was able to compete for [[cattle]] transportation with the [[Kansas Pacific Railway]]. Construction continued, and the Santa Fe opened the last section of track between Topeka and the [[Colorado]]/[[Kansas]] border on [[December 23]] [[1873]]. The Santa Fe's tracks reached [[Pueblo, Colorado]] on [[March 1]] [[1876]]. Serving Pueblo opened a number of new freight opportunities for the railroad as it now could haul [[coal]] from Colorado eastward.(<small>Early history</small>)[http://www.kancoll.org/khq/1968/68_2_snell+wilson.htm]

Building across Kansas and eastern Colorado may have been technologically simple as there weren't many large natural obstacles in the way (certainly not as many as the railroad was about to encounter further west), but the Santa Fe found it almost economically impossible because of the sparse population in the area. To combat this problem, the Santa Fe set up [[real estate]] offices in the area and vigorously promoted settlement across Kansas on the land that was granted to the railroad by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1863. The Santa Fe offered discounted passenger fares to anyone who travelled west on the railroad to inspect the land; if the land was subsequently purchased by the traveller, the railroad applied the passenger's ticket price toward the sale of the land. Now that the railroad had built across the plains and had a customer base providing income for the firm, it was time to turn its attention toward the difficult terrain of the [[Rocky Mountains]].

===Crossing the Rockies===
[[Image:Royal gorge.jpg|Royal Gorge|thumb|250px|right|The D&RG mainline through the Royal Gorge in 1881.]]
[[Leadville, Colorado|Leadville]] was the most productive of all of the Colorado mining regions. Mining in the area began in 1859, first for gold and then two decades later for silver. Several of the Santa Fe's board of directors (along with President [[William Barstow Strong|Strong]]) sought to capitalize on the need to supply the mining towns of Colorado and northern New Mexico with food, equipment, and other supplies. To that end, Santa Fe sought to extend its route westward from [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]] along the [[Arkansas River]], and through the [[Royal Gorge]] in 1877. Royal Gorge was a bottleneck along the Arkansas too narrow for both the Santa Fe and the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]] to pass through, and there was no other reasonable access to the South Park area; thus, a race ensued to build rail access through the Gorge. Physical confrontations led to two years of armed conflict, essentially low-level guerrilla warfare between the two companies that came to be known as the [[Royal Gorge Railroad War]]. Federal intervention prompted an out-of-court settlement on [[February 2]], [[1880]] in the form of the so-called "Treaty of Boston" wherein the D&RG was allowed to complete its line and lease it for use by the Santa Fe. The D&RG paid an estimated $1.4 million to Santa Fe for its work within the Gorge and agreed not to extend its line to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], while the AT&SF agreed to forgo its planned routes to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and Leadville.

Also looking to the south, an initial outlay of $20,000 was authorized on [[February 26]], [[1878]] for the construction of a rail line south from [[Trinidad, Colorado|Trinidad]] in order to "''..seize and hold [[Raton Pass]]''." The location of the route was nearly as crucial to the venture's success as was the actual track construction. W. R. "Ray" Morley, a former civil engineer for the  (D&RG) hired by the AT&SF in 1877, was given his first assignment to secretly plot a route through the pass (it was feared that any activity in the area would lead the D&RG to construct a narrow gauge line over the Pass). Additionally, Strong learned that the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] (SP) had introduced legislation to block the Santa Fe's entry into New Mexico. Undaunted, Strong obtained a charter for the [[New Mexico and Southern Pacific Railroad Company]] and immediately sent A. A. Robinson to Raton Pass. From February to December of 1878 work crews struggled to build the line between [[La Junta, Colorado|La Junta]] and Raton, and the first Santa Fe train entered New Mexico on [[December 7]].

===Facing the competition===
{{sectstub}}
[[Image:ATSF 1890s passenger train.jpg|325px|thumb|An AT&SF [[passenger train]] in operation, ''circa'' [[1895]].]]
While construction over the Rockies was slow and difficult due to the logistics involved, in some instances armed conflicts with competitors arose (such as with the D&RG in [[Colorado]] and [[New Mexico]], and &mdash; after capturing the Raton Pass &mdash; the SP in [[Arizona]] and [[California]], as exemplified in the "[[frog war]]" between SP and Santa Fe subsidiary the [[California Southern Railroad]] at [[Colton, California]] in September of 1883). The troubles for the railroad went far beyond skirmishes with rival railroads, however. In the late 1880s, [[George C. Magoun]], who had worked his way to become Chairman of the Board of Directors for the railroad, was progressively losing his own health. In 1889 the railroad's stock price, which was closely linked in the public's eye with the successes of the railroad's chairman, fell from nearly [[United States dollar|$]]140 per share to around $20 per share. Magoun's health continued to deteriorate along with the stock price and Magoun died on [[December 20]], [[1893]]. The Santa Fe entered receivership three days later on [[December 23]] [[1893]], with [[Joseph Reinhart|J. W. Reinhart]], [[John J. McCook]] and [[Joseph C. Wilson (ATSF)|Joseph C. Wilson]] appointed as receivers.

===The failed SPSF merger===
{{main|Southern Pacific Santa Fe Railroad}}

The '''Southern Pacific Santa Fe Railroad (SPSF)''' was a proposed merger between the parent companies of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] and Santa Fe railroads announced on [[December 23]], [[1983]]. As a part of the joining of the two firms, all of the rail and non-rail assets owned by [[Santa Fe Industries]] and the Southern Pacific Transportation Company was placed under the control of a holding company, the '''Santa Fe<U+2013>Southern Pacific Corporation'''. The merger was subsequently denied by the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC) on the basis that it would create too many duplicate routes. 

The companies were so confident that the merger would be approved they began repainting locomotives and non-revenue rolling stock in a new unified paint scheme. After the ICC's denial, railfans joked that SPSF really stood for "Shouldn't Paint So Fast". While the Southern Pacific was sold off, all of the California real estate holdings were consolidated in a new company, [[Catellus Development Corporation]], making it the State's largest private land owner. Some time later, Catellus would purchase the [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific Railroad's]] interest in the [[Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal]] (LAUPT).

===Merger into BNSF===
{{main|BNSF Railway}}
On [[December 31]], [[1996]] the ATSF merged with the [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] to form the [[Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway]]. Some of the challenges resulting from the joining of the two companies included the establishment of a common dispatching system, the unionization of Santa Fe's non-union dispatchers, and incorporating the Santa Fe's train identification codes throughout.

==Passenger train service==
[[Image:Santa Fe passenger timetable cover, Nov 29 1942.jpg|thumb|300px|The cover of the railroad's [[November 29]] [[1942]] passenger [[timetable]]. Vignettes of the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people were common in Santa Fe advertising.]]

The Santa Fe was widely known for its [[passenger train]] service in the first half of the [[20th century]]. The Santa Fe introduced many innovations in passenger rail travel, among these the "Pleasure [[Dome car|Domes]]" of the ''[[Super Chief]]'' (billed as the "''...only dome car[s] between Chicago and Los Angeles''" when they were introduced in [[1951]]) and the "Big Dome"-Lounge cars and [[double-decker]] "Hi-Level" cars of the ''[[El Capitan (passenger train)|El Capitan]]'', which entered revenue service in [[1954]]. The Santa Fe was among the first railroads to add dining cars to its passenger train consists in [[1891]], following the examples of the [[Northern Pacific Railroad|Northern Pacific]] and [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] Railroads. Dining along the Santa Fe was often a memorable experience, whether it be on-board in a [[dining car]], or at one of the many [[Harvey House]] restaurants that were strategically located throughout the system.

In general, the same train name was used for both directions of a particular train. The exceptions to this rule included the ''Chicagoan'' and ''Kansas Cityan'' trains (both names referred to the same service, but the ''Chicagoan'' was the eastbound version, while the ''Kansas Cityan'' was the westbound version), and the ''Eastern Express'' and ''West Texas Express''. All of the Santa Fe's trains that terminated in Chicago did so at [[Dearborn Station (Chicago)|Dearborn Station]]. Trains terminating in Los Angeles arrived at Santa Fe's [[La Grande Station]] until May, [[1939]], when the Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal ([[LAUPT]]) was opened.

To reach smaller communities, the railroad often operated Rail Diesel Cars ([[RDC]]s) for communities on the railroad, and bus connections were provided throughout the system via [[Trailways Transportation System|Santa Fe Trailways]] buses to other locations. These smaller trains generally were not named, only the train numbers were used to differentiate services.

The ubiquitous passenger service inspired the title of the 1946 [[Academy-Award]]-winning [[Johnny Mercer]] tune "[[On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe]]."

===One-time and special trains===
Occasionally, a special train was chartered to make a high-profile run over the Santa Fe's track. These specials were not included in the railroad's regular revenue service lineup, but were intended as one-time (and usually one-way) traversals of the railroad. Some of the more notable specials include:
* ''[[Cheney Special]]'': [[Colton, California]] <U+2014> Chicago, Illinois (a one-time train that ran in [[1895]] on behalf of B.P. Cheney, a director of the Santa Fe).
* ''[[Clark Special]]'': [[Winslow, Arizona]] <U+2014> Chicago, Illinois (a one-time train that ran in [[1904]] on behalf of Charles W. Clarke, the son of then Arizona senator William Andrew Clark).
* [[Image:ATSF Scott Special 1905.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A promotional brochure for the Santa Fe Railway's ''Scott Special'' passenger train.]]''[[David B. Jones Special]]'': [[Lake Forest, Illinois]] <U+2014> Los Angeles, California (a one-time, record-breaking train that ran in [[1923]] on behalf of the president of the [[Mineral Point Zinc Company]]).

===Diesel locomotives, passenger===

[[Image:ATSF Chief 1926.png|thumb|150px|right|The 1926 ''Chief'' "drumhead" logo.]]
Santa Fe's first set of diesel-electric passenger locomotives was placed in service on the ''[[Super Chief]]'' in [[1936]], and consisted of a pair of blunt-nosed units ([[EMD 1800 hp B-B]]) designated as Nos. 1 and 1A. The upper portion of the sides and ends of the units were painted '''gold''', while the lower section was a '''dark olive green''' color; an olive stripe also ran along the sides and widened as it crossed the front of the locomotive. 

Riveted to the sides of the units were metal plaques bearing a large "Indian Head" [[logo]], which owed its origin to the [[1926]] ''[[Chief (passenger train)|Chief]]'' "[[drumhead (sign)|drumhead]]" logo. "'''''Super Chief'''''" was emblazoned on a plaque located on the front. The rooftop was '''light slate gray''', rimmed by a '''red''' pinstripe. This unique combination of colors was referred to as the ''Golden Olive'' paint scheme [http://www.divisionpoint.com/photos/AT&SF_1spot/DP-3004-1Apilot.jpg] [http://www.divisionpoint.com/photos/AT&SF_1spot/DP-3004-1Apilotdetail.jpg]. Before entering service, [[Sterling McDonald]]<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] "Styling Department" augmented the look with the addition of red and blue striping along both the sides and ends of the units in order to enhance their appearance.

In a little over a year the EMD E1 (a new and improved streamlined locomotive) would be pulling ''Super Chief'' and other passenger consists, resplendent in the now-famous ''Warbonnet'' paint scheme devised by [[Leland Knickerbocker]] of the GM "Art and Color Section." Reminiscent of a [[North American Indians|Native American]] ceremonial [[headgear|headdress]], the scheme consisted of a '''red''' "bonnet" which wrapped around the front of the unit, that was bordered by a '''yellow''' stripe and '''black''' pinstripe. The extent of the bonnet varied according to the locomotive model, and was largely determined by the shape and length of the carbody. The remainder of the unit was either painted '''silver''' or was composed of stainless steel panels. 

All units wore a nose emblem consisting of an elongated yellow "Circle and Cross" emblem with integral "tabs" on the nose and the sides, outlined and accented with black pinstripes, with variances according to the locomotive model. "'''SANTA FE'''" was displayed on the horizontal limb of the cross in black, [[Art Deco]]-style lettering. This emblem has come to be known as the "cigar band" due to its uncanny resemblance to the same. On all but the "[http://www.northeast.railfan.net/images/tr_sf90.jpg Erie-built]" units (which were essentially run as a demonstrator set), U28CGs, U30CGs, and FP45s, a three-part yellow and black stripe ran up the nose behind the band.

A "Circle and Cross" motif (consisting of a yellow field, with red quadrants, outlined in black) was painted around the side windows on "as-delivered" E1 units. Similar designs were added to E3s, E6s, the [http://abpr2.railfan.net/november05/11-26-05/AT+SF50atArgentineKS5-18-57AlChione+ScanColl.jpg DL109/110] locomotive set, and ATSF 1A after it was rebuilt and repainted. The sides of the units typically bore the words "'''SANTA FE'''" in black, 5"<U+2013> or 9"<U+2013>high extra extended Railroad Roman letters, as well as the "Indian Head" logo [http://www.railpictures.net/viewphoto.php?id=113871] [http://www.railpictures.net/viewphoto.php?id=113864], with a few notable exceptions.

In later years, Santa Fe adapted the scheme to its gas-electric "[[Doodlebug#Railroads|doodlebug]]" units [http://www.railpictures.net/viewphoto.php?id=97719]. The standard for all of Santa Fe's passenger locomotives, the ''Warbonnet'' is considered by many to be the most recognized corporate logo in the railroad industry. Early in the Amtrak Era, Santa Fe embarked on a program to paint over the red bonnet on its F units that were still engaged in hauling passenger consists with '''yellow''' (also called ''Yellowbonnets'') or '''dark blue''' (nicknamed ''Bluebonnets'') as it no longer wanted to project the image of a passenger carrier.

===Diesel locomotives, freight===
[[Image:ATSF FT 144.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Santa Fe FT locomotive set #144LABC, wearing the blue and yellow ''Cat Whiskers'' paint scheme, pass near [[Belen, New Mexico]] in January of 1947.]]
[[Image:ATSF box logo blue.png|thumb|150px|right|Santa Fe's blue and white "box" logo adorned many of the railroads early diesel locomotives. A dark blue logo on a yellow background was adopted in 1960 and retained until [[1974]].]]
[[Diesel locomotive]]s used as switchers between [[1934]] and [[1960]] were painted black, with just a thin white or silver horizontal accent stripe (the sills were painted similarly). The letters "'''A.T.& S.F.'''" were applied in a small font centered on the sides of the unit, as was the standard blue and white "'''Santa Fe'''" box logo. After [[World War II]], diagonal white or silver stripes were added to the ends and cab sides to increase the visibility at grade crossings (typically referred to as the ''Zebra Stripe'' scheme). "'''A.T.& S.F.'''" was now placed along the sides of the unit just above the accent stripe, with the blue and white "'''Santa Fe'''" box logo below.

Due to the lack of abundant water sources in the American desert, the Santa Fe was among the first railroads to receive large numbers of streamlined diesel locomotives for use in freight service, this in the form of the [[EMD FT]]. For the first group of FTs delivered between December, [[1940]] and March, 1943 (#100<U+2013>#119) the railroad selected a color scheme consisting of dark blue accented by a pale yellow stripe up the nose, and pale yellow highlights around the cab and along the mesh and framing of openings in the sides of the engine compartment; a thin, red stripe separated the blue areas from the yellow. 

Because of a labor dispute with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, who insisted that every cab in a diesel-electric locomotive consist must be manned, FT sets #101-#105 were delivered in A-B-B-B sets, instead of the A-B-B-A sets used by the rest of the Santa Fe's FTs.  The Santa Fe quickly prevailed in this labor dispute, and FT sets #106 on were delivered as A-B-B-A sets.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The words "'''SANTA FE'''" were applied in yellow in a 5"<U+2013>high extended font, and centered on the nose was the "'''Santa Fe'''" box logo (initially consisting of a blue cross, circle, and square painted on a solid [[bronze]] sheet, but subsequently changed to baked steel sheets painted bronze with the blue identifying elements applied on top). Three thin, pale yellow stripes (known as ''Cat Whiskers'') around the cab sides. In January, [[1951]] Santa Fe revised the scheme to consist of three yellow stripes running up the nose, and the addition of a blue and yellow ''Cigar Band'' (similar in size and shape to that applied to passenger units); the blue background and elongated yellow "'''SANTA FE'''" lettering were retained.

The years [[1960]] to [[1972]] saw non-streamlined freight locomotives sporting the ''Billboard'' color scheme (sometimes referred to as the ''Pinstripe'' scheme) wherein the units were predominantly dark blue with yellow ends and trim, with a single yellow accent pinstripe. The words "'''Santa Fe'''" were applied in yellow in a large serif font (logotype) to the sides of the locomotive below the accent stripe (save for [[classification yard|yard]] [[switcher]]s which displayed the "'''SANTA FE'''" in small yellow letters above the accent stripe, somewhat akin to the ''Zebra Stripe'' arrangement).

From [[1972]] to [[1996]], and even on into the BNSF era, the company adopted a new paint scheme often known among railfans as the ''Yellowbonnet'' which placed more yellow on the locomotives (reminiscent of the company's retired ''Warbonnet'' scheme), the goal again to ensure higher visibility at grade crossings. The truck assemblies, previously colored black, now received silver paint.

In June, [[1989]] Santa Fe resurrected the ''Warbonnet'' and applied the scheme in a modified fashion to two [[EMD FP45]] units, #5992 and #5998 (this time, displaying "'''Santa Fe'''" in large, "billboard"-style red letters across the side). The units were re-designated as #101 and #102 and reentered service on [[July 4]], [[1989]] as part of the new "Super Fleet" (the first Santa Fe units to be so decorated for freight service). The six remaining FP45 units were thereafter similarly repainted and renumbered. From that point forward, all new locomotives wore the red and silver, and many retained this scheme after the [[BNSF Railway|Burlington Northern Santa Fe]] merger, some with "'''BNSF'''" displayed across their sides.

For the initial deliveries of factory new "Super Fleet" equipment, the Santa Fe took delivery of the [[EMD GP60M]], [[EMD GP60B|GP60B]] and [[GE Dash 8-40BW|General Electric B40-8W]], which made the Santa Fe the only US [[Class I railroad]] to operate 4-axle (B-B) freight locomotives equipped with the [[North American Safety Cab]].  These units were intended for high-speed intermodal service, but towards the final days of the Santa Fe, could be found working local trains and [[branchline]] assignments.

Several experimental and commemorative paint schemes emerged during the Santa Fe's diesel era. One combination was developed and partially implemented in anticipation of a merger between the parent companies of the Santa Fe and [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] (SP) railroads in [[1984]]. The red, yellow, and black paint scheme (with large red block letters "SF" on the sides and ends of the units) of the proposed [[Southern Pacific Santa Fe Railroad]] (SPSF) has come to be somewhat derisively known among [[railfan]]s as the ''Kodachrome'' livery due to the similarity in colors to the boxes containing slide film sold by the [[Eastman Kodak Company]] under the same name ([[Kodachrome]] film was one of the preferred brands in use by railfans). A common joke among railfans is that "SPSF" really stands for "''Shouldn't Paint So Fast''." Though the merger application was subsequently denied by the [[Interstate Commerce Commission|ICC]], locomotives bearing this color scheme can still be found occasionally in lease service.

==Ferry service==
[[Image:CHS.1794.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Santa Fe's ''San Pablo'' ferry plies the waters of [[San Francisco Bay]] in the early 20th century.]]
The Santa Fe maintained and operated a fleet of three passenger [[ferry]] boats (the ''San Pablo'', the ''San Pedro'', and the ''Ocean Wave'') that connected Oakland with San Francisco by water. The ships traveled the eight miles between the San Francisco Ferry Terminal and the railroad's [[Richmond, California|Point Richmond]] terminal across the Bay. The service was originally established as a continuation of the company's named passenger train runs such as the ''Angel'' and the ''Saint''. The larger two ships (the ''San Pablo'' and the ''San Pedro'') carried [[Fred Harvey Company]] dining facilities. 

The rival [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] owned the world's largest [[Ferries of San Francisco Bay|ferry fleet]] (which was subsidized by other railroad activities), at its peak carrying 40 million passengers and 60 million vehicles annually aboard 43 vessels. Santa Fe discontinued ferry service in 1933 due to the effects of the [[Great Depression]]; the construction of the [[San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge]] initiated the slow decline in demand for SP's ferry service, which was eventually discontinued as well.
