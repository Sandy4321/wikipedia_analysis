'''Youngstown-Warren Air Reserve Station''' {{Airport codes|YNG|KYNG}} is a military facility located in [[Vienna Center, Ohio]], 11 miles north of [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]] and 10 miles east of [[Warren, Ohio|Warren]], in [[Trumbull County, Ohio|Trumbull County]], [[Ohio]], in the [[United States]]. The installation is located at [[Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport]].  The host wing for the installation is the [[910th Airlift Wing]] (910 AW), an [[Air Force Reserve Command]] ([[AFRC]]) unit operationally gained by the [[Air Mobility Command]] (AMC).

== Mission ==
Youngstown ARS is located at the [[Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport]]. Its primary mission is to serve as home of the [[910th Airlift Wing]], and its twelve (12) [[C-130 Hercules|C-130H Hercules]] aircraft operated by two (2) C-130 squadrons. The 910 AW is a unique organization in the Air Force in that a portion of the wing's mission is devoted to the Department of Defense's only fixed-wing aerial spray mission.

== Staffing ==
The 910 AW has nearly 1,450 military personnel &mdash; approximately 300 Air Reserve Technician (ART) personnel, augmented by approximately 1,150 "traditional" part-time Air Force Reservists and 150 full-time civilians. The installation also hosts a Navy Operational Support Center and a collocated Marine Corps Reserve Center that are home to nearly 400 Navy and Marine Corps Reservists.<ref>[http://www.youngstown.afrc.af.mil/questions  Youngstown ARB Fact Sheet]</ref>

== History ==
The history of Youngstown ARS dates to the early 1950s when it was originally opened as '''Youngstown Air Force Base'''.  Beginning in 1951, the [[Air Defense Command]] (ADC) began negotiations with the local community to construct an Air Force Base to defend the north-central United States.  Negotiations were finalized and the new base was dedicated on 11 August 1952.<ref>[http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/106/114.xml USAFHRA Document 01106114]</ref>  The housekeeping unit of the $10 million air defense base was the 88th Air Base Squadron with the ADC 86th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron being the operational unit flying [[F-84|F-84C Thunderjets]]. Assigned to ADC's [[Central Air Defense Force]], the 86th would remain at Youngstown until 1960, eventually upgrading to the [[F-102 Delta Dagger]].<ref>USAF Aerospace Defense Command publication, The Interceptor, January 1979 (Volume 21, Number 1).</ref> On 18 August 1955, the [[30th Air Division]], [[79th Medical Wing|79th Fighter Group (Air Defense)]] was assigned.<ref>[http://www.afhra.af.mil/organizationalrecords USAFHRA Organizational Records]</ref><ref>79th Fighter Group in Maurer, Maurer (1983). Air Force Combat Units Of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History. ISBN 0892010924.</ref>

On 26 May 1952, the [[Air Force Reserve]]'s 26th Fighter-Bomber Squadron was assigned to Youngstown.  Formerly a Troop Carrier Squadron, the unit had been activated during the [[Korean War]] and after being inactivated, was assigned to Youngstown as a reserve [[T-33 Shooting Star]] squadron.<ref>Airborne Troop Carriers, Turner Publishing Company, 1991. ISBN 1563110407</ref> The 26th FBS received [[F-86|F-86H Sabres]] in 1958, but shortly afterward was inactivated and redesignated as the 757th Troop Carrier Squadron.  The F-86s that had been received, but never flown while they were going through acceptance checks, and the T-33s, which were flying, were taken out and replaced by [[C-119 Flying Boxcar]]s<ref>[http://dspace.maag.ysu.edu:8080/dspace/bitstream/1989/902/2/OH72.pdf Reserve History in Youngstown Ohio]</ref>

In 1959, the need for active duty Air Defense Command bases and regular Air Force fighter-interceptor operations were diminishing and the intent to scale back operations at Youngstown AFB was announced on October 28, 1959.  The Air Force transferred command of Youngstown AFB to [[Continental Air Command]] (ConAC) (now the [[Air Force Reserve Command]]) on 1 March 1960 and the 79th Fighter Group was inactivated that date.<ref>[http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/435/777.xml USAFHRA Document 00435777]</ref><ref>[http://www.youngstown.afrc.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3412  Youngstown AFRC Factsheet]</ref><ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/youngstown.htm Global Security.org]</ref>

As Youngstown-Warren ARS, the installation has 59 operational buildings, primarily aviation maintenance, training and administrative facilities. While there are dormitories for temporary lodging, there is no permanent housing on the installation.

The current host wing, the 910th Airlift Wing (910 AW) traces its lineage at Youngstown to 1963 when it was established as the 910th Troop Carrier Group flying the [[C-119 Flying Boxcar]].  1969. The group later trained as a forward air control/tactical air support group from 1970<U+2013>1971, as an air support special operations group from 1971<U+2013>1973, and as a fighter group from 1973<U+2013>1981, during which time it operated the [[A-37 Dragonfly]] and [[U-3 Blue Canoe]] and was operationally gained by the [[Tactical Air Command]] ([[TAC]]). It converted to an airlift mission in 1981 and received its first C-130 aircraft 27 March 1981, at which point it became the 910th Tactical Airlift Group and operationally gained by the [[Military Airlift Command]] ([[Military Airlift Command|MAC]]).

In January 1992, the 910 TAG became the only full-time, fixed-wing aerial spray unit in the Department of Defense.  In June of that year, as part of an Air Force-wide reorganization, MAC was disestablished and the unit was renamed the 910th Airlift Group, operationally-gained by the newly established [[Air Mobility Command]] (AMC).

In 1994, the Air Force Reserve became a separate Major Command (MAJCOM) in the Air Force organizational structure as [[Air Force Reserve Command]] ([[AFRC]]).  Per AFRC direction, the unit was renamed the 910th Airlift Wing (910 AW) while still retaining its operational relationship with AMC.
