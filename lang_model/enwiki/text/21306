The '''Mohonk Mountain House''' is a historic and distinguished American [[resort]] hotel located atop the [[Shawangunk Ridge]] in [[Ulster County, New York]]. Its prominent location in the town of [[New Paltz]] is just beyond the southern border of the [[Catskill Mountains]] on the western side of the [[Hudson River]].  Two important policy conferences of domestic and international significance have taken place at this renowned hotel.

== History ==
The historic resort sits directly on the shore of [[Lake Mohonk]], which is half of a [[mile]] (800 [[meter|m]]) long and 60 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (20 [[meter|m]]) deep. The main structure, which was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1986, was built by [[Quaker]] twin brothers [[Albert Smiley|Albert]] and [[Alfred Smiley]] between [[1879]] and [[1910]].  It has 266 guest rooms, including 28 tower rooms, an indoor pool and [[destination spa|spa]], and an outdoor ice-skating rink for winter use.  The picturesque setting of the resort on the lake was once featured in an original picture print by [[Currier & Ives]].  Mohonk means "lake in the sky" in the native American Indian language.

The property today has continued since [[1869]] to be owned and operated by descendants of the Smiley brothers. It consists of 2,200 [[acre]]s (8.9 km<U+00B2>) and much of it is beautifully landscaped with meadows and manicured gardens.  The property adjoins 6,400 acres (26 km<U+00B2>) of the [[Mohonk Preserve]], which is crisscrossed by 85 miles (140 km) of hiking trails and carriage roads. The Smiley Family conveyed portions of their property into the Preserve; they have received awards for the stewardship of their land and their early environmental awareness. A reciprocal agreement allows Preserve members and day visitors to visit the resort grounds, and there is a network of well-maintained trails that visitors can follow in all seasons.

== Recreation and other activities ==
Resort guests may ride horseback, go boating on the lake, play tennis, croquet, and shuffleboard, tour a historic barn and greenhouse, take carriage rides, swim or fish in the lake, receive spa treatments, visit the fitness center, play golf, listen to concerts and lectures, hike on mountain trails, or stroll through formal gardens and a maze. Winter activities include snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, and ice-skating. Many of the recreational activities are provided as part of the room rate. The resort is open year-round.

A library in the main building provides a setting to relax after outdoor activities, and books written by regular Mohonk guests can be found there. The hotel also has a gift shop and special rooms to view television and the internet. Supervised children's activities are available for adults who want privacy or free time to explore the resort on their own. 

All overnight guests at The Mohonk Mountain House are on the "Full American Plan."  Three meals and afternoon tea are provided daily as part of the room rate. Guests checking into the resort are first offered tea and cookies in the late afternoon, followed by dinner, and breakfast the next morning. Check out time is 2:00 p.m. after lunch is finished. The main dining room provides guests with a magnificent view to the north of the [[Catskill Mountains]]. In the summer a lunch buffet is also available at the outdoor "Granary" perched on a cliff overlooking Lake Mohonk. Day guests are permitted to make advance reservations to purchase meals in the hotel or to spend the day hiking in the hotel's grounds and the Mohonk Preserve.

== Notable guests and important conferences held at Mohonk ==
The Mohonk Mountain House has hosted many famous visitors over the years, such as industrialist [[John D. Rockefeller]], naturalist [[John Burroughs]], industrialist [[Andrew Carnegie]], and American presidents [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[William Howard Taft]], [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], and [[Chester A. Arthur]].  Former First Lady [[Julia Grant]] and religious leaders such as Rabbi [[Louis Finkelstein]], Reverend [[Ralph W. Sockman]], and [[`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>]], the eldest son of [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith]] founder [[Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h]], have also stayed there.

From 1883 to 1916 annual conferences took place at Mohonk Mountain House, sponsored by Albert Smiley, to improve the living standards of native American Indian populations.  These meetings brought together government representatives of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and the House and Senate committees on Indian Affairs, as well as educators, philanthropists, and Indian leaders to discuss the formulation of policy. The 22,000 records from the 34 conference reports are now at the library of [[Haverford College]] for researchers and students of American history.

The hotel also hosted the [[Lake Mohonk Conference on International Arbitration]] between 1895 and 1916, which was highly instrumental in creating the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in [[The Hague]], Netherlands. Those conference papers were donated by the Smiley Family to [[Swarthmore College]] for future research.

== Publicity ==
The Mountain House was featured on The Today Show on September 28, 2006 for a teambuilding adventure for Meredith Vieira and Ann Curry.

In recent years the Mohonk Mountain House has been featured on [[The Travel Channel]] and the television program "America's Castles" on the [[A&E Network]], among other programs. The resort was the setting of a 1994 feature film, ''[[The Road to Wellville]]'', starring [[Anthony Hopkins]] and [[Matthew Broderick]]. Perhaps the best publicity for the resort over the years, however, has been word-of-mouth.
