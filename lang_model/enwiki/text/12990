'''USS ''De Soto''''' was a fast wooden-[[hull (watercraft)|hulled]] sidewheel steamship that saw service as a [[U.S. Navy]] [[gunboat]] during the [[American Civil War]]. 

''De Soto'' was originally a privately-owned vessel, built for passenger service between [[New York City|New York]] and [[New Orleans]]. With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, she was purchased by the Navy, commissioned as USS ''De Soto'', and sent to assist with the blockade of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] ports. ''De Soto''{{'}}s speed made her an effective pursuit ship, and she would capture or bring about the destruction of a total of eighteen [[blockade runner]]s during the war.  

In the postwar period, ''De Soto'' continued to serve with the Navy, mostly in [[South America]]n waters, until resold to her original owners in 1868 for resumption of service as a passenger ship. She caught fire and was burned to the waterline in December 1870. 

==Construction and design==

''De Soto'' was built by Lawrence & Foulks of [[Brooklyn, New York]] in 1859 for Livingston, Crocheron & Co., which ran a line of passenger steamships between New York and New Orleans.<ref name=morrison_p456+note>Morrison, p. 456. Morrison states that the ship was completed in May 1860, but this is clearly an error as a number of voyages made by the ship in 1859 are documented in ''The New York Times''.</ref> At 1,675 tons and 253 feet in length, ''De Soto'' was quite a large steamer for her time, and considered a fine example of her type.<ref name=morrison_p456>Morrison, p. 456.</ref> She was named after [[Hernando De Soto]], a [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer and [[conquistador]].<ref name=danfs/> 

''De Soto'' was powered by a 65-inch [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], 11-foot [[stroke (engine)|stroke]] [[marine steam engine#Walking beam|vertical beam]] engine,<ref name=baughman_p244>Baughman, p. 244.</ref> built by the [[Morgan Iron Works]] of New York.<ref name=baughman_p244/><ref name=morrison_p456/> The engine, which drove a pair of 30-foot<ref name=baughman_p244/> sidewheels,<ref name=morrison_p456/><ref name=danfs/> was capable of delivering up to 14 mph (12 knots)&mdash;a high speed for the time, which would soon make ''De Soto'' a favorite with the travelling public and which would later prove invaluable for pursuing [[blockade runner]]s during the Civil War.<ref name=danfs>[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/d2/de_soto-i.htm ''De Soto''], ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]''.</ref> The ship had a single, raked [[smokestack]] forward of the engine, and two masts, one fore and one aft&mdash;the fore mast [[square rigging|square rigged]]&mdash;to provide auxiliary sail power.<ref name=nhc_photos>See the Eric Heyl watercolor at the Naval Historical Center's [http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-d/desoto.htm photo page] for USS De Soto.</ref>

==Commercial service, 1859&ndash;61== 

''De Soto'' appears to have entered service in August 1859,<ref name=nyt_25aug1859>[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B02E1D81F31EE34BC4D51DFBE668382649FDE "Movements Of Ocean Steamers"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1859-08-25.</ref> carrying mail, passengers and [[specie]] between New York and New Orleans, with an intermediate stop at [[Havana, Cuba]]. She would maintain a regular service on this route, making a round trip about once a month,<ref name=google>See [http://news.google.com/archivesearch?as_user_ldate=1859&as_user_hdate=1861&q=steamer+de+soto&num=100&as_price=p0&scoring=a&hl=en&ned=au&q=steamer+de+soto&lnav=od&btnG=Go Google News Archive search], for "steamer De Soto" from 1859 to 1861. Note that there was also a ''De Soto'' running between the United Kingdom and the U.S. in this period; this was a different vessel.</ref> until shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861.<ref name=morrison_p456/> 

The ship made a fast passage of less than four days from Havana to New York in April 1860, at an average speed of around 14 mph. By this time she had already earned a reputation as a "fast and popular steamship".<ref name=nyt_20apr1860>[http://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/20/news/news-of-the-day.html "News Of The Day"], ''The New York Times'', 1860-04-20.</ref> Another fast run, again at an average speed of about 14 mph, was made in June following.<ref name=nyt_20jun1860>[http://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/20/news/from-havana-negroes-landed-a-cargo-captured-the-sugar-market.html "From Havana"], ''The New York Times'', 1860-06-20.</ref>  

In addition to her passengers and cargo, ''De Soto'', like other steamships of the era, also acted as a conduit for news between the various ports. Most of the news conveyed by ''De Soto'' was of a mundane character&mdash;for example, reports of activity on the Havana sugar market&mdash;but sometimes it was of more interest. In October 1860 for instance, ''De Soto'' reported the interception at [[Sierra Morena, Cuba]] of an illegal slave ship carrying 800 [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]]. The captain and crew of the slave ship were detained by local authorities, but about 400 of the slaves had already been dispersed ashore and could not be retrieved.<ref name=nyt_13oct1860>[http://www.nytimes.com/1860/10/13/news/havana-arrival-de-soto-cargo-slaves-landed-american-screw-steamer-city-norfolk.html "From Havana - Arrival Of The De Soto"], ''The New York Times'', 1860-10-13.</ref> 

''De Soto'' became one of the last steamships to engage in trade between the North and the breakaway Southern states when she departed New York for New Orleans on April 23, 1861, eleven days after the outbreak of the Civil War. The Confederacy however missed the opportunity to seize the vessel, and she returned safely to New York.<ref name=morrison_p456/> On 6 May, ''De Soto'' departed New York for Havana once again, but on this occasion it was "not considered prudent" for the ship to continue on to New Orleans.<ref name=nyt_21may1861>[http://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/21/news/havana-arrival-de-soto-mercantile-intelligence-niagara-huntsville-cruising-for.html?pagewanted=1 "News From Havana - Arrival of the De Soto"], ''The New York Times'', 1861-05-21.</ref>  

''De Soto'' made one further voyage to Havana in June.<ref name=nyt_6jun1861>[http://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/06/news/from-havana-mercantile-intelligence-the-light-on-cape-hatteras-extinguished.html "From Havana"], ''The New York Times'', 1861-06-06.</ref> On 21 August 1861, she was purchased for the sum of $161,250<ref name=documents_p478>''Documents'', p. 478.</ref> by the U.S. Navy for conversion into a gunboat.<ref name=danfs/>

==American Civil War, 1861&ndash;65== 

===Gulf Blockading Squadron===  

At the [[New York Navy Yard]], ''De Soto'' was fitted out for naval service, including the installation of a [[artillery battery|battery]] consisting of one 30-pounder [[Parrott rifle]] and eight 32-pound guns. She was then commissioned as USS ''De Soto'', with Commander William M. Walker placed in command.<ref name=danfs/> 

The steamer put to sea on 19 November with ordnance stores for [[Fort Pickens, Florida]], and vessels in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], arriving off Southwest Pass, [[Mississippi River]], after 11 December. Joining the [[Gulf Blockading Squadron]] at that time, ''De Soto'' patrolled for Confederate [[blockade runners]] near [[Barataria Bay]]. Given the sometimes light winds of the Gulf and inshore waters, the vessel's shallow [[draft (hull)|draft]] and steam power gave ''De Soto'' an advantage over her mainly sail-powered prey. Cmdr. Walker's first month in the region began poorly, however, when his ship collided with the [[France|French]] war steamer ''Milan'', then adrift off South West Pass, Mississippi River. Although damage to ''De Soto'' was slight, the ''Milan'' was disabled and thus needed a tow into the Union anchorage.<ref name=danfs/> 

In spite of this initial mishap, ''De Soto''{{'}}s first capture did not take long, as she and a [[bluejacket]]-crewed [[lugger]] took [[schooner]] ''Major Barbour'' off [[Isles Derni<U+00E8>res]], [[Louisiana]] on 28 January 1862. Cmdr. Walker's crew discovered 8 barrels of [[gunpowder]] and 198 cases of gunpowder, [[nitrate]]s, [[sulfur]], and [[percussion caps]] in the blockade runner. On 8 February, the steamer caught the small schooner ''Star'' out of [[Bayou Lafourche]], taking her four-man crew prisoner.<ref name=danfs/>

===Western Blockading Squadron===   

Upon Rear Admiral [[David G. Farragut]]'s arrival at [[Key West, Florida]], in steam [[sloop-of-war]] [[USS Hartford (1858)|''Hartford'']] in late February, the Gulf Blockading Squadron was split into parts, the Eastern and Western Gulf Blockading Squadrons. ''De Soto'' came under the command of the Western Blockading Squadron at that time, although she did not change her patrol station at [[Barataria, Louisiana]]. As the steamer continued [[blockade]] operations through the spring, ''De Soto'' also served as a mobile storeship, carrying extra bread and [[Ammunition#Ordnance ammunition|ordnance]] supplies. She remained there until early July, when she made a quick run up the Mississippi River, carrying letters and passengers to the warships participating in the siege of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. Returning down river, ''De Soto'' sailed southeast along the coast of [[Texas]], patrolling off [[Sabine Pass]], the [[Brazos River]] and [[Brazos Island|Brazos Santiago]] at the mouth of the [[Rio Grande River]].<ref name=danfs/>

===Repair and refit===  

Three months of hot weather and lack of maintenance facilities took a toll on ''De Soto's'' [[boilers]] and she returned to New Orleans, Louisiana, for temporary repairs in early October. A backlog of work and lack of funds forced Rear Adm. David Farragut to send ''De Soto'' north, however, and the steamer arrived at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] only on 18 November. Two months of repair work followed, during which time Cmdr. Walker was promoted to Captain.<ref name=danfs/> At this time, ''De Soto''{{'}}s battery was also changed, to one 11-inch [[Dahlgren gun|Dahlgren]], one 30-pounder Parrot rifle, six 32-pound rifles and two 12-pound [[smoothbore]]s.<ref name=heyl_p129/> 

''De Soto'' stood down the [[Delaware River]] on 3 February 1863 and, after stops at Havana, Cuba and [[Santo Domingo]], arrived back at Key West, Florida on the 15th.<ref name=danfs/>

===Eastern Gulf Blockade===  

Assigned to the [[Eastern Gulf Blockading Squadron]] under Rear Admiral [[Theodorus Bailey (US Navy officer)|Theodorus Bailey]], ''De Soto'' spent March and April fruitlessly cruising for [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']] in the Gulf of Mexico. As one of the few fast steamers in Bailey's command, ''De Soto'' possessed a speed advantage over most of her blockade running prey. This was demonstrated on 24 April, when ''De Soto'' sailors boarded and seized two sloops, ''Jane Adelie'' and ''Bright'', sixteen hours out of [[Mobile, Alabama]], and each laden with [[King Cotton|cotton]]. Two schooners, ''General Prim'' and ''Rapid'', were then taken the very next day, and they too carried cotton. All four prizes were sent to Key West for adjudication. On 27 April, ''De Soto'' continued the run of good luck, seizing the British schooner ''Clarita'' enroute from Havana, Cuba to Matamoras.<ref name=danfs/> 

Patrolling north and west of the [[Dry Tortugas|Tortugas]], the warship then captured the schooner ''Sea Bird'' on 14 May. Three days later, ''De Soto'' pursued the smoke of an unknown steamer and, after an 18-hour chase, forced her to stop in open water well south of [[Mobile Bay]]. Before ''De Soto's'' boats could board, however, the enemy steamer's crew set fires and abandoned ship, sinking what turned out to be Confederate steamer ''Cuba'' beneath the waves. ''De Soto'' continued her fast pace of operations the next day, capturing schooner ''Mississippian'' on 19 May before finally returning to Key West for repairs.<ref name=danfs/> 
[[ File:USS Ossipee (1861).jpg | thumb | left | The screw steamer {{USS|Ossipee|1861|6}}. In June 1863, ''Ossipee'' lost a race with ''De Soto'' for the capture of a Confederate steamer. | alt=USS Ossipee. The ship lies at anchor in what appears to be an otherwise deserted bay. A low, dark shoreline covered with trees is behind the ship in the middle distance. Ossipee has three masts, but her short, broad smokestack cannot be seen at all because of the dark shoreline behind. The vessel looks to be a natural wood color, excepting two narrow white stripes running the length of the hull, one a little below the main deck and one along the waterline, which is clearly visible. A row of what looks like gunports can be seen just below the upper white line. The ship has a rounded stern and a pronounced clipper bow. The vessel is in the process of lowering a boat, which is hovering just above the sea near the ship's bow. ]]   
Returning to sea in mid-June, ''De Soto's'' luck held and she captured schooner ''Lady Maria'' north of [[Tampa Bay]] on 6 July, laden with 104 bales of cotton. On the 18th, while cruising near Mobile Bay, ''De Soto'' spotted a steamer and closed and took the steamer ''James Battle'', laden with [[rosin]] and cotton. At that point, two screw steamers from the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, [[USS Aroostook (1861)|''Aroostook'']] and [[USS Ossipee (1861)|''Ossipee'']], closed with some disappointment, as they had been chasing the [[blockade runner]]. Later that same evening, as ''De Soto'' and ''Ossipee'' independently chased a second steamer, Capt. Walker closed and took ''William Bagley'' before the other Union ship could do so. Those actions by ''De Soto'', which put Capt. Jonathan P. Gillis of the ''Ossipee'' in mind of "a voracious aquatic bird," led to a dispute over [[prize (law)|prize]] claims. The controversy was resolved later in the month when Rear Admiral Bailey and Rear Admiral David G. Farragut, commander of the Western Gulf Blockading Squadron, agreed to split prize shares.<ref name=danfs/> 

''De Soto'' continued her patrols in the Gulf of Mexico into the month of August, braving the sweltering heat to board and inspect coastal and seaborne traffic. The steamer ''Alice Vivian'' was seized on 16 August, as she had no papers, and the steamer ''Nita'' was taken the next day for the same reason. During this month, wear and tear on the steamer's boilers began to show and, despite attempts at repair, ''De Soto'' steadily lost speed. On 12 September, following a nine hour chase under steam and sail, the Union ship finally took the blockade runner ''Montgomery'', a chase Capt. Walker claimed should have taken one fourth the time if the boilers were in good order. Tinkering helped build up steam pressure to a point, and ''De Soto'' managed to chase down the screw steamer ''Leviathan'' on 22 September.<ref name=danfs/> 

Returning to Key West in late October, ''De Soto'' received minor repairs and re-coaled. Capt. Walker was relieved of command in early November by Capt. Gustavus H. Scott, before spending the next six weeks patrolling off N. E. Providence Channel. After coaling at Key West in early January 1864, ''De Soto'' patrolled off Mobile Bay, where she chased and captured steamer ''Cumberland'' on 5 February. The "Anglo-rebel" steamer had loaded arms, ammunition and 100 barrels of gunpowder at Havana in late 1863 and was trying to slip into Mobile when taken. ''De Soto'' proceeded to Havana in late February, for dry docking and repairs to her hull, before taking up a patrol station off the east coast of [[Florida]] in mid-March. A month later, she was back in Key West for coaling and repairs before returning to her familiar hunting grounds southeast of Mobile Bay.<ref name=danfs/>

===Yellow fever outbreak===  

Sometime in April or May, ''De Soto's'' crew began coming down with [[yellow fever]] and the steamer was sent north in early June, arriving at [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], on 16 June. As per normal practice, the warship was decommissioned that same day and the crew [[quarantine]]d until the fever burned out. On 12 January 1865, ''De Soto'' was sent to [[Baltimore, Maryland]] for the installation of new boilers. She was still there when the war ended on 9 April 1865.<ref name=danfs/>

==Postwar naval service, 1865&ndash;68== 
===North Atlantic Squadron===  

''De Soto'' was recommissioned at Baltimore on 12 August 1865, with Captain Walker placed back in command. The steamer stood out for [[Norfolk, Virginia]], on 7 September and joined the newly organized North Atlantic Squadron, whose cruising ground covered the [[Atlantic Ocean]] south to the [[West Indies]] and the Gulf of Mexico.<ref name=danfs/>

===Haiti rebellion===  

At this time, "revolutionists" in [[Haiti]] were fighting the government of [[Fabre Geffrard|President Geffrard]] from a base at [[Cape Haiten]], and ''De Soto'' steamed to that port to safeguard Americans residing in that area. On 19 October, following a confrontation between the rebel steamer ''Providence'' and HMS ''Bulldog'', revolutionaries in the port seized refugees out of the British [[Consulate]], which was viewed as a "gross outrage against the British flag." On 23 October, despite Capt. Walker's attempts at mediation, HMS ''Bulldog'' attacked both the fort guarding the harbor and batteries in town. While so doing, the [[Royal Navy]] steamer ran hard aground inside the harbor. She continued to fire, however, and her cannon sank ''Providence'' and destroyed many buildings ashore. Being in cold iron, ''De Soto'' could not immediately move, but Capt. Walker did send his boats ashore to take off foreigners. A short while later, Captain Wake in HMS ''Bulldog'' asked for towing assistance, which Capt. Walker denied, though ''De Soto's'' boats did take off the sick and wounded. Following a boiler explosion, and unable to get off the reef, the British blew up their warship and withdrew from the harbor in their boats.<ref name=danfs/> 

''De Soto'' withdrew the next day as well, carrying the wounded British sailors to [[Jamaica]] before putting in to [[Port-au-Prince]], to debark the many foreign refugees picked up at Cape Haiten. After consultations with the American Consul, Capt. Walker took ''De Soto'' back to Cape Haiten on 7 November. There, he negotiated with a British squadron under Captain Macguire in HMS ''Galatea'' in the hopes of averting a retaliatory bombardment of the town, particularly as the Americans feared such an act would provoke widespread unrest and attacks on foreigners throughout Haiti. These talks failed and on 9 November, the British squadron bombarded the town in conjunction with an attack by President Geffrard's forces. With the defensive works destroyed and the town falling to government forces, the rebel leaders took refuge on ''De Soto''. Capt. Walker then carried them to Monte Christo in the [[Dominican Republic]]. ''De Soto'' returned to Cape Haiten to keep an eye on events until 13 December when she sailed for home, arriving in [[Hampton Roads]] on 19 December.<ref name=danfs/>

===Later South American service===

Benath the waistcoat he is wearing a white shirt, with what looks like a high starched collar, wrapped with what may be a broad bow tie, the same dark color as his uniform. He is bald, with tufts of black hair above his ears, and a mostly grey beard and moustache. He gazes at the camera with a steady and composed look. ]] 
Three days later, ''De Soto'' stood up the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the [[Potomac River]] to the [[Washington Navy Yard]], where she picked up letters for the West Indies. Steaming south on 1 January 1866, the warship stopped at Santo Domingo, Port-au-Prince and Havana before returning to [[Washington, D.C.]], on the 28th. She remained there until 19 March when she proceeded down river and into the Bay, reaching Hampton Roads on the 23d. On 10th April the warship was placed under the command of Captain [[Charles S. Boggs]].<ref name=danfs/> 

As the revolutionary disturbances in, and friction between, Haiti and the Dominican Republic continued apace, ''De Soto'' returned to the West Indies in June, arriving at Port-au-Prince on the 19th. The steamer also patrolled in the Gulf of Mexico, with an eye on the unsettled conditions in [[Mexico]], where a [[guerilla war]] raged against the French occupation of the country. ''De Soto'' remained in the region through the rest of the year before returning to Hampton Roads in the spring of 1867.<ref name=danfs/>

===Earthquake and tsunami===  

Following a repair period at the [[Norfolk Navy Yard]], ''De Soto'' conducted a cruise to New Orleans in May and June, putting in at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 21 June. She stood down on the Delaware River five weeks later, this time sailing to Mexico. Off [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Vera Cruz, Mexico]], on 17 September, the steamer watched the last of the French occupation end before sailing to [[Pensacola, Florida]], for repairs in mid-October. ''De Soto'' proceeded south along the [[Florida]] coast on 22 October, stopping at Tampa Bay and Key West before arriving at [[St. Thomas, Virgin Islands]], on 17 November. The ship, in company with sidewheel steamer {{USS|Susquehanna|1847|2}} and screw sloop-of-war {{USS|Monongahela|1862|2}}, was there as part of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]]'s plan to purchase the [[Danish West Indies]]. The day after ''De Soto's'' arrival, however, a magnitude 7.5 [[earthquake]] struck the region and a [[tsunami]] swept the steamer from her moorings and threw the ship onto a wharf. Luckily, the next wave lifted the ship and carried her back to deep water. With her bottom damaged and leaking badly, ''De Soto's'' sailors and carpenters spent the next ten days pumping water and repairing the hull. On 5 December, the steamer sailed north with the Danish Commissioner on board and the ship arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on the 17th.<ref name=danfs/>

===Final naval mission===  

After completing more substantial repairs over the winter, ''De Soto'' sailed to [[Venezuela]] on 3 March 1868, to secure the release of crewmen from the whaling schooner ''Hannah Grant'', who had been captured on the peninsula of Paraguano. At [[Cura<U+00E7>ao]], Capt. Boggs learned that the crew had already been released, but he remained in Venezuelan waters in support of the American minister during interviews with the Venezuelan vice-president and other officials of the Republic.<ref name=danfs/> 

''De Soto'' steamed to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] on 28 August, and then proceeded to the New York Navy Yard in early September. There she was decommissioned on 11 September 1868.<ref name=danfs/>

==Return to commercial service, 1868&ndash;70==    

On 30 September 1868, ''De Soto'' was resold to her original owners, now known as Livingston, Fox & Co. After a thorough reconditioning,<ref name=heyl_p129/> she was returned to service as a commercial steamship, operating on her old route between New York and New Orleans with a port of call at Havana.<ref name=morrison_p460>Morrison, p. 460.</ref> She maintained a monthly service on this route for another two years.<ref name=googlesearch_1868to1870>[http://news.google.com/archivesearch?as_user_ldate=1868&as_user_hdate=1870&q=steamer+de+soto&num=100&as_price=p0&scoring=a&hl=en&ned=au&q=steamer+de+soto&lnav=od&btnG=Go Google News Archive search] for "steamer De Soto" from 1868 to 1870.</ref> 

On 25 December 1870, ''De Soto'' cleared New Orleans for New York but collided with a [[towboat]] and was forced to return to dock for repairs. On 31 December, she set out for New York again, with a cargo of 988 bales of cotton, 200 hogsheads of sugar, 1000 barrels of [[molasses]] and sundries. After travelling only 27 miles, a fire broke out onboard and the steamer was beached at McCalls Flat, where she burned to the waterline.
