'''Outram Secondary School''', abbreviated as '''OSS''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: '''<U+6B27><U+5357><U+4E2D><U+5B66>''', [[Pinyin]]: '''O<U+016B> N<U+00E1>n Zh<U+014D>ng Xu<U+00E9>''') is a [[government]] [[school]] in [[Singapore]]. Founded in 1906 as Outram Road School, then Outram School by [[gazette]] notification, Outram Secondary School is one of the oldest schools in Singapore. It is reputed for being the only school offering a [[Commerce|commercial]] education in the 60s and 70s. It is also the first government school in Singapore to own a [[swimming pool]].  The current principal of Outram Secondary School is Madam Choy Wai Yin.

==History==
[[Image:Oldschool.jpg|right|200 px]]
=== Prior to 1874 ===

Before 1874, in response to a need to provide the opportunity of learning English through the medium of the mother tongue of the various races, two schools were built in Singapore, one at Cross Street and other at Kampong Glam.

=== Establishment of school ===

As the numbers in the school at Cross Street grew, there was a plan to establish a training school to meet demands. But for some unknown reasons, this plan did not materialise. A new school, Outram Road School, built at Outram Road, was formally opened by the Governor of Singapore, Sir John Anderson on 26th February 1906. By Gazette notification in 1939 the word "Road" was deleted and the school was known as Outram School.

=== Early history from 1906 ===

Outram School functioned as a Primary School. Acting as a feeder school, Pearl's Hill Standard One proceeded to Standard Two at Outram. Likewise, Outram was the feeder school to [[Raffles Institution]]. The working arrangement between Pearl's Hill School and Outram School continued up to January 1953 whereas the working agreement between Outram and [[Raffles Institution]] ceased with the fall of Singapore in February [[1942]]. After the war, Outram boys competed with other Government Primary School pupils in securing places in Government Secondary Schools.

=== Lost records (1906 to 1942) ===

Under the orders of the Education Department, Mr SG Mohamed Ghows, who was Outram's Principal in 1941, sent all Outram School's records to the Pasir Panjang English School for safe keeping. Subsequently, this school suffered a direct hit during the [[World War II]] and with it went all Outram's past records, from [[1906]] to [[1942]].

=== Conversion into a secondary school in 1954 ===

On 1st January [[1954]], Outram ceased to be a purely [[Primary School]] and was converted to a four year Secondary Commercial School with a four year secondary school course leading to the School Certificate of Commercial Education of the London Chamber of Commerce. With the conversion, the school motto was changed from "ON TO SUCCESS" to "LABOR OMNIA VINCIT" <U+2013> Labour Conquers All. The School's crest was also changed. 

=== Significant events from 1954 to present ===

Three cheers for Outram School.<br>

=== The School Badge ===

[[Image:SchoolBadge.jpg|frame|Outram Secondary School's Badge]]
The new school badge was introduced in [[1958]]. Initiated by [[C.A. Peterson]], the design of the school badge was registered with the [[College of Arms]], UK. Shaped Like a shield, it had a book and two clasps on the top, the coat of the arms of the city of [[Singapore]] on the left and three broad bands of red, blue and yellow, the colour of the school on the right. The original colours of the School were red and blue, but since the celebration of the golden Anniversary, yellow had been incorporated.

''The Book'' - Academic learning, the principle aim of the school; to instruct, to impart knowledge, to teach and to learn.<br>
''The Lion'' - Our association with [[Singapore]], the [[Lion City]].<br>
''The Castle'' - A tower of learning; a place where all can study (work); a self-contained unit; a place where unity, cooperation and teamwork produce a community (tower) of strength.<br>

The LION and the CASTLE together symbolize Outram as one of the centre of learning in [[Singapore]].

== School Advisory Committee ==

The School Advisory Committee (SAC) of Outram Secondary School not only promotes closer relationship between the community and the school, it also takes an active interest in student and staff welfare and encourages students' extracurricular activities aimed at all round development.

Members of the committee have organised various fund-raising events such as Swimathons and Funfairs to raise funds for school activities and improvement projects.

The committee is responsible in building the Swimming Pool and Squash Complex. The SAC encourages student participation in water sports. An evidence of this strong support is when SAC sponsored our water-polo team on an overseas trip for being first in an inter-school competition. The committee gives the Outstanding Student Award to the best all-rounder on Annual Speech Day Celebrations to inspire students to strive towards excellence. It also sponsors annual staff dinners in which the Chairman generously presents souvenirs to long-serving teachers and non-teaching staff in appreciation of their loyalty and service.

== Parent-Teacher Association ==

The Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) of Outram Secondary School helps to promote co-operation and understanding between parents and the Principal and teachers for the welfare of the pupils. It provides opportunities for discussion and explanation of matters relating to the education of the pupils and encourages social interaction between parents and teachers. In Outram, the PTA has been deeply involved in promoting pupil welfare. Annually, it gives a scholarship award to the top 'O' level student and bursaries to needy pupils. It encourages pupils to read by presenting shields to champion reading classes. It also inspires excellence in sports by donating a challenge trophy for the champion house for the annual cross country championship.

Every year, the PTA hosts the Secondary One Orientation to familiarise new pupils and parents with the school and its facilities. It organises gatherings for teachers and parents to discuss pupils' progress. It also organises talks for parents as well. 

== Old Outramian's Association ==

The Old Outramians' Association (OOA) serves as a link between past students and the school. It enables past students to gather and interact, preserving and renewing old friendships, and provides an opportunity for past students to give something back to the school which has nurtured them.

Old boys are role models and a source of inspiration to present pupils to strive towards success. Above all, they help to instill in pupils the sense of loyalty and pride for the school.

Like the SAC and PTA, the Old Outramians' Association encourages excellence in ECA and academic performance by giving awards to outstanding students on Speech Day Celebrations. It has helped to raise funds for the school by organising charity dinners, a golf championship and a film premiere. The OOA has also offered the use of the OOA Room, a facility fully funded by the OOA, to the school as a Pupil Activity Centre - a "home away from home" or after-care centre for the latchkey pupils.
