Most Chatino communities have public services, and there are [[runway]]s for airports in many [[municipality|municipalities]]. Federal bilingual schools, high schools, and ''[[telesecundaria]]s'' (distance education programs for secondary and high school students) have been established.

The traditional authorities of this people are organized in a system based on civil and religious roles, in which advice from elders is treated as the greatest authority. They believe in the Holy Grandmother, the Holy Father Sun, the Holy Mother Earth, and the Holy Mother Moon. In addition, they worship the deities of water, wind, rain, the mountain, and fire.
