'''''Alexander''''' is a [[real-time strategy]] game created by [[GSC Game World]] (creators of ''[[Cossacks: European Wars]]'' and ''[[Cossacks II: Napoleonic Wars]]'') and published by Ubisoft, based on the 2004 [[Alexander (film)|film]] of the same name. Its gameplay is akin to that of Cossacks, with elements of the [[Age of Empires series]] and ''[[Age of Mythology]]'' visible.

==Reaction==
When the game was released, it was praised for features such as "large battles give you a realistic feel of warfare". However the game was criticized for poor pathfinding, weak AI and poor voice acting. The [[GameSpot]] review said "There are numerous spelling errors, shoddy writing (some archers are described as being the "same as the other archers"), technical issues, and occasionally horrible controls. All this seems to indicate that the game was rushed to meet a deadline that would coincide with the movie's release, which is unfortunate because the developer, GSC Game World, has produced good strategy titles in the past." Like the movie it was based on, opinions on the game varies. GameSpot gave it a 5.2 out of 10 while [[IGN]] gave a 7.0 out of 10.
