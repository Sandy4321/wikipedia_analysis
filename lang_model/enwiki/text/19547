'''George I, King of the Hellenes''' (Greek: '''<U+0393><U+03B5><U+03CE><U+03C1><U+03B3><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2> A', <U+0392><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03CD><U+03C2> <U+03C4><U+03C9><U+03BD> <U+0395><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03AE><U+03BD><U+03C9><U+03BD>''') ([[December 24]], [[1845]] &ndash; [[March 18]], [[1913]]) was [[King of the Hellenes]] ([[Greece]]) from 1863 to 1913. As the first monarch of the new Greek dynasty, his 50-year reign (the longest in modern Greek history) was characterized by territorial gain and political coming-of-age as Greece established her place in pre-war Europe.

==Birth and early life==
He was born in [[Copenhagen]], the second son of King [[Christian IX of Denmark]] and [[Louise of Hesse|Queen Louise of Denmark]]. Until his accession in Greece, he was known as Prince Vilhelm (namesake of his paternal and maternal grandfathers, "William" in English). He was brother to [[Alexandra of Denmark]] ([[Queen consort]] of King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom]]) and [[Maria Fyodorovna]], consort of [[Alexander III of Russia]]. He began his career in the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Royal Danish Navy|navy]], and was elected King of the Hellenes on [[March 30]] [[1863]]([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]) following the deposition of King [[Otto of Greece|Otto]]. Ironically, he ascended a royal throne before his father.

George was part of a group of European royals of his day descended from several [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Emperors]]; see [[Byzantine descent of Danish royals of Greece]].

==Another candidate for the Crown==
George was not the first choice of the Greek people. Upon the overthrow of Otto, the Greek people had rejected his brother [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Leopold]], the [[heir presumptive]], while adhering to the concept of a monarchy. Many Greeks seeking closer ties to the preeminent world power, [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] rallied around [[Queen Victoria]]'s second son, [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred]]. British Foreign Minister [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] believed that the Greeks were "panting for increase in territory",<ref>John Van der Kiste, ''Kings of the Hellenes''; Sutton Publishing, 1994; ISBN 0-7509-2147-1 p.4</ref> hoping for a gift of the [[Ionian Islands]]. The [[London Conference of 1832]] prohibited any of the Great Powers' ruling families from accepting the crown, and, in any event, Queen Victoria was adamantly opposed. The Greeks nevertheless insisted on holding a plebiscite in which over 95% of the 240 000 votes went for Prince Alfred.<ref>Richard Clogg, ''A Short History of Modern Greece'' (Cambridge University Press, 1979) p.82</ref> There were 93 votes for a republic and 6 for a Greek.<ref>Edward S Forster, ''A Short History of Modern Greece 1821-1956 3rd edition'' (Methuen and Co., London, 1958) p.17</ref> King Otto received one vote.<ref>Van der Kiste, p.5</ref>

Eventually the Greeks and Great Powers winnowed their choice to Prince William of Denmark. There were two significant differences from the elevation of his predecessor: he was elected unanimously by the Greek Assembly, rather than imposed on the people by foreign powers and he was proclaimed 'King of the Hellenes' instead of King of Greece.<ref>C M Woodhouse, ''The Story of Modern Greece'' (Faber and Faber, London, 1968) p.170</ref>

At his enthronement in [[Copenhagen]] attended by a delegation of Greeks led by First Admiral and Prime Minister [[Kanaris]] it was announced that the British government would cede the [[Ionian Islands]] to Greece in honor of the new monarch.<ref>''The Times (London)'' 8 June 1863 p.12 col.C</ref> 
==Early reign (1863-1870)==
The new seventeen-year old king arrived in Athens on [[30 October]] [[1863]].<ref>Forster, p.18</ref> He was determined not to make the mistakes of his predecessor, so he quickly learned [[Greek language|Greek]] in addition to his native [[Danish language|Danish]]. He adopted the motto, "My strength is the love of my people." The new king was seen frequently and informally in the streets of Athens, where his predecessor had only appeared in pomp. King George found the palace in a state of disarray after the hasty departure of King Otto and took to putting it right and updating the 40 year old building. He also sought to ensure that he was not seen as too influenced by his Danish advisers, ultimately sending his uncle [[Julius of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl<U+00FC>cksburg|Julius of Glucksburg]] back to Denmark with the words, "I will not allow any interference with the conduct of my government."<ref>''The Times (London)'' 14 February 1865 p.10 col.C</ref>

Politically, the new king took steps to bring the protracted constitutional deliberations of the Assembly to conclusion. On [[October 19]] [[1864]] he sent a demand, countersigned by Kanaris, to the Assembly explaining that he had accepted the crown on the understanding that a new constitution would be finalised, and that if it was not he would feel himself at "perfect liberty to adopt such measures as the disappointment of my hopes may suggest."<ref>Royal Message to the National Assembly, 6 October 1864</ref> It was unclear from the wording whether he meant to return to [[Denmark]] or impose a constitution, but as either event was undesirable the Assembly soon came to an agreement.

On [[November 28]], [[1864]] he took the oath to defend the new [[Greek Constitution of 1864|Constitution]] which created a unicameral Assembly (''Vouli'') with representatives elected by direct, secret, universal male suffrage, a first in modern Europe. A constitutional monarchy was set up with George always deferring to the legitimate authority of the elected officials whilst not unaware of the corruption present in elections, and the difficulty of ruling a mostly illiterate population.<ref>John Campbell and Philip Sherrard, ''Modern Greece'' (Ernest Benn, London, 1968) p.99</ref> Between 1864 and 1910 there were twenty-one general elections and seventy different governments.<ref>Woodhouse, p.172</ref>

Maintaining a strong relationship with his brother-in-law, [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]] (eventually King Edward VII of the UK), King George sought his help in defusing the recurring issue of [[Crete]], an overwhelmingly Greek island which remained under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control. Since the reign of Otto, this desire to unite Greek lands in one nation had been a sore spot with [[Great Britain]] and [[France]], which had embarrassed Otto by occupying the main port [[Piraeus]] to dissuade Greek [[irredentism]] during the [[Crimean War]]. <ref>Woodhouse, p.167</ref> When the Cretans rose in rebellion in [[1866]], the Prince of Wales sought the Foreign Secretary [[Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]]'s support in intervening in Crete on behalf of Greece.<ref>Van der Kiste, p.23</ref> Ultimately, the Great Powers did not intervene and the Ottomans put down the rebellion.

==Establishing a dynasty==
During a trip to [[Russia]] to meet with his sister [[Maria Fyodorovna]], consort to [[Alexander III of Russia]], he met [[Olga Konstantinovna of Russia]], a direct [[matrilineal]] descendant of Empress [[Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera]], who was just 16 when they married on [[October 27]], [[1867]]([[Gregorian calendar]]) at [[St Petersburg]]. They had eight children:

* [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] ([[1868]]-[[1923]])
* [[Prince George of Greece|George]] ([[1869]]-[[1957]]), High Commissioner of [[Crete]]
* [[Alexandra Georgievna of Greece|Alexandra]] ([[1870]]-[[1891]]), married [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich]] of Russia (son of [[Alexander II of Russia]]). Mother of [[Dmitri Pavlovich Romanov]], assassin of [[Grigori Rasputin]].
* [[Prince Nicholas of Greece|Nicholas]] ([[1872]]-[[1938]]), father of [[Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark]] and [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent]].
* [[Princess Maria Georgievna of Greece|Marie]] ([[1876]]-[[1940]]), married first [[Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia]] and second Admiral [[Perikles Ioannidis]].
* Olga ([[1881]]), died aged three months
* [[Prince Andrew of Greece|Andrew]] ([[1882]]-[[1944]]), father of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].
* [[Prince Christopher of Greece|Christopher]] ([[1888]]-[[1940]]), father of [[Prince Michael of Greece]].

When alone with his wife, he usually conversed in [[German language|German]]. Their children were taught [[English language|English]] by their nannies, and when talking with his children he therefore spoke mainly English.<ref>Forster, p.74</ref> Intent on not letting his subjects know of his missing his native land, he discreetly maintained a dairy at his palace at [[Tatoi]], which was managed by his former countrymen from Denmark as a bucolic reminder of his homeland.<ref>Van der Kiste, p.37</ref> Queen Olga was far less careful in her expression of apostasy from her native Russia, often visiting Russian ships at anchor in [[Piraeus]] two or three times before they weighed anchor.<ref>Van der Kiste, p.39</ref>

The king was related by marriage to the rulers of Great Britain, Russia and Prussia, maintaining a particularly strong attachment to the Prince and Princess of Wales, who visited Athens in [[1869]]. Their visit occurred despite continued lawlessness which culminated in the murder of a party of British and Italian tourists, which included the [[first cousin]] of [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon]] and the brother-in-law of [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon]], [[Lord President of the Council]].<ref>The King of the Hellenes to the Prince of Wales, April 1870. In: ''Letters of Queen Victoria 1870-1878'' (John Murray, London, 1926) vol.II p.16</ref><ref>The four murdered men were Mr. Frederick Vyner, Mr. Lloyd (an engineer), British diplomat Mr. E. H. C. Herbert, and Italian diplomat Count de Boyl.</ref> George's relationships with the other ruling houses would assist the king and his small country but also often put them at the center of national political struggles in Europe.

==Territorial expansion (1871-1881)==
Throughout the 1870s Greece kept pressure on the Ottoman Empire seeking territorial expansion into [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]]. The [[Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877-1878 provided the first potential alliance for the Greek kingdom. George<U+2019>s sister [[Dagmar of Denmark|Dagmar]] was the daughter-in-law of the Russian [[Tsar]] and she sought to have Greece join the war. The French and British refused to countenance such an act, and Greece remained neutral. At the [[Congress of Berlin]] convened in [[1878]] to determine peace terms for the Russo-Turkish War, Greece staked a claim to Crete, Epirus and Thessaly.

[[Image:5dracme1874front.jpg|thumb|left|100px|George I on the 1874 5-[[drachma]] coin]]
The borders still were not finalized in June [[1880]] when a proposal very favorable to Greece which included [[Mount Olympus]] and [[Ioannina]] was offered by the British and French. When the Ottoman Turks strenuously objected, Prime Minister [[Charilaos Trikoupis]] made the mistake of threatening a mobilization of the Greek Army. A coincident change of government in France led to disputes amongst the Great Powers and, despite British support for a more pro-Greek settlement, the Turks subsequently granted Greece all of Thessaly but only the part of Epirus around [[Arta]]. When the government of Trikoupis fell, the new Prime Minister, [[Alexandros Koumoundouros]] reluctantly accepted the new boundaries.<ref name="woodhouse">Woodhouse, p.181</ref>

==National progress (1882-1900)==
[[Image:King George 1st of Greece Journal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|King George I of Hellenes on the front page of the french newspaper [[Le Petit Journal|''"Le Petit Journal"'']]]]

While Trikoupis followed a policy of retrenchment within the established borders of the Greek state, having learned a valuable lesson about the viccisitudes of the Great Powers, his main opponents, the [[National Party (Greece)|National Party]] led by [[Theodoros Deligiannis|Theodoros Deliyannis]], sought to inflame the anti-Turkish feelings of the Greeks at every opportunity. The next opportunity arose when in [[1885]] [[Bulgaria|Bulgarians]] rose in revolt of their Turkish overlords and declared themselves independent. Deliyannis rode to victory over Trikoupis in elections that year saying that if the Bulgarians could defy the [[Treaty of Berlin]], so should the Greeks. Deliyannis mobilized the Greek Army and the British [[Royal Navy]] blockaded Greece. Ironically, the Admiral in charge of the blockade was Prince Alfred who had been the first choice of the Greeks to be their king in [[1863]],<ref name="woodhouse" /> and the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] at the time was the [[Marquess of Ripon]] whose brother-in-law had been murdered in Greece 16 years before.<ref>Van der Kiste, p.35</ref> This was not the last time that King George would discover that his family ties would not always be to his advantage. Deliyannis was forced to demobilize and Trikoupis regained the premiership. Between [[1882]] and [[1897]] Trikoupis and Deliyannis would alternate the premiership as their fortunes rose and fell.

Greece in the last decades of the [[19th Century]] was increasingly prosperous and developing a sense of its role on the European stage. In [[1893]] the [[Corinth Canal]] was built by a French company cutting the sea journey from the Adriatic to [[Piraeus]] by 150 miles. In [[1896]] the [[Olympic Games]] were revived in Athens and the Opening Ceremony presided over by the King. When [[Spiridon Louis]] a shepherd from just outside Athens ran into the [[Panathinaiko]] Stadium to win the Marathon event, the Crown Prince ran down onto the field to run the last thousand yards beside the Greek gold medalist, while the King stood and applauded.<ref>Van der Kiste, p.54-55</ref>

The popular desire to unite all Greeks within the territory of their kingdom ([[Megali Idea]]) was never far below the surface and another revolt against Turkish rule in Crete erupted again. In January [[1897]], King George sent his son, [[Prince George of Greece|Prince George]] to take possession of Crete. The Greeks refused an Ottoman offer of an autonomous administration and Deliyannis mobilized for war. The Great Powers refused the expansion of Greece and on [[February 25]], [[1897]] announced that Crete would be under an autonomous administration and ordered the Greek and Ottoman Turk militias to withdraw. The Turks agreed, but Prime Minister Deliyannis refused and dispatched 1500 volunteers to Crete. Whilst the Great Powers announced a blockade, Greek troops crossed the [[Macedonian]] border and the [[Sultan]] declared [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|war]]. Announcement that Greece was finally at war with the Turks was greeted by delirious displays of patriotism and spontaneous parades in honor of the king in Athens. Volunteers by the thousands streamed north to join the forces under the command of [[Constantine I of Greece|Crown Prince Constantine]].

The war went badly for the ill-prepared Greeks, the only saving grace being the swiftness with which the Greek Army was overrun. By the end of April 1897 the war was lost. The worst consequences of defeat for the Greeks were mitigated by the intervention of the king's relatives in Britain and Russia; nevertheless, the Greeks were forced to give up Crete to international administration, and agree to minor territorial concessions in favor of the Turks and an indemnity of 4,000,000 Turkish pounds.<ref>Clogg, p.94</ref>

The jubilation with which Greeks had hailed their king at the beginning of the war was reversed in defeat. For a time he considered abdication. It was not until the king faced down an assassination attempt in February [[1898]] with great bravery that his subjects again held their monarch in high esteem.

Later that year after continued unrest in Crete, which included the murder of the British vice-consul<ref>Forster, p.33</ref>, the Great Powers proposed making [[Prince George of Greece]] Governor-General of Crete under the suzerainty of the Sultan, thus effectively putting Greece in day-to-day control of Crete for the first time in modern history.

==Later reign (1901-1913)==
The death of Britain's Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] in [[1901]], left King George as the second-longest reigning monarch in Europe.<ref>Van der Kiste, p.63</ref> His always-cordial relations with the new [[King Edward VII]] continued to tie Greece to Britain. This was abundantly important in Britain's support of the King's son, George as Governor-General of Crete. Nevertheless, George resigned in [[1906]] after a leader in the Cretan Assembly, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] campaigned to have him removed. As a response to the [[Young Turk Revolution]] of [[1908]], Venizelos<U+2019>s power base was further strengthened and on [[8 October]] [[1908]] the Cretan Assembly passed a resolution in favour of union despite both the reservations of the Athens government<ref>Campbell and Sherrard, p.109-110</ref> and the objections of the Great Powers.<ref>Forster, p.44</ref> The muted reaction of the Athens Government to the news from Crete led to an unsettled state of affairs on the mainland. A group of military officers formed a military league [[Stratiotikos Syndesmos]] that demanded that the Royal family be stripped of their military commissions. To save the king the embarrassment of removing his sons from their commissions, they resigned them. The military league attempted a coup d'etat called the [[Goudi Pronunciamento]] and the king insisted on supporting the duly elected parliament in response. Eventually, the military league joined forces with Venizelos in calling for a National Assembly to revise the constitution. King George gave way and new elections to the revising assembly were held. After some political maneuvering, Venizelos became Prime Minister of a minority government. Just a month later Venizelos called new elections at which he won a colossal majority after most of the opposition parties declined to take part.

Venizelos and the King were united in their belief that the nation required a strong army to repair the damage of the humiliating defeat of 1897. Crown Prince Constantine was reinstated as Inspector-General of the army, and later Commander-in-Chief. Under his and Venizelos<U+2019>s close supervision the military was retrained and equipped with French and British help and new ships ordered for the [[Hellenic Navy|navy]]. Meanwhile, through diplomatic means, Venizelos had united the Christian countries of the Balkans in opposition to the ailing Ottoman Empire.

On [[October 8]], [[1912]] [[Montenegro]] declared war on Turkey followed quickly, after ultimata, by [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]] and Greece in what was known as the [[First Balkan War]]. This campaign was the polar opposite of [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|1897]]. The well-trained Greek forces, 200,000 strong, won victory after victory. On [[9 November]] [[1912]], Greek forces rode into [[Salonika]], just a few hours ahead of a Bulgarian division. Followed by the Crown Prince and Venizelos in a parade a few days later, King George rode in triumph through the streets of the second largest Greek city. 

Just as he did in Athens, the King went about [[Salonika]] without any meaningful protection force. While out on an afternoon walk near the White Tower on [[March 18]] [[1913]], he was shot at close range in the back by [[psychopath]]  [[socialist]]-[[anarchist]] [[Alexandros Schinas]].<ref>''The Times (London)'' 19 March 1913 p.6</ref> The Greek government denied any political motive for the assassination, saying that Schinas was an alcoholic vagrant.<ref>''The Times (London)'' 20 March 1913 p.6</ref> Schinas was tortured in prison and six weeks later fell to his death from a police station window.

For five days the coffin of the King draped in Danish and Greek flags lay in the [[Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens|Metropolis]] in Athens before his body was committed to the tomb at his palace in [[Tatoi]]. Unlike his father, the new King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]] was to prove less willing to accept the advice of ministers, or that of the three protecting powers ([[Great Britain]], [[France]] and [[Russia]]).
