'''Merck & Co., Inc.''' ({{nyse|MRK}}), [[Doing business as|dba]] '''Merck Sharp & Dohme''', '''MSD''' outside the United States and Canada, is one of the largest [[pharmaceutical companies]] in the world. [[Merck headquarters]] is located in [[Whitehouse Station]], [[New Jersey]]. The company was established in 1891 as the United States subsidiary of the German company now known as [[Merck KGaA]]. Merck & Co. was confiscated by the US government during [[World War I]] and subsequently established as an independent American company. It is currently one of the World's seven largest pharmaceutical companies by [[market capitalization]] and revenue.

The company describes itself as "a global research-driven pharmaceutical company" that "discovers, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of innovative products to improve human and [[animal health]], directly and through its joint ventures".

Merck also publishes [[The Merck Manuals]], a series of medical reference books for physicians, nurses, and technicians. These include the ''[[Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy]]'', the world's best-selling medical textbook, and the ''[[Merck Index]]'', a compendium of chemical compounds.

In 2011 the company received the "Facility of the Year"-Award for the integration of its global clinical supplies manufacturing, packing, and warehouse building in [[Summit, New Jersey|Summit]], [[New Jersey]], [[USA]].

==History==
Merck & Co. traces its origins to Friedrich Jacob Merck, who purchased a drug store in [[Darmstadt]], Germany, in 1668, and also to Emanuel Merck, who took over the store several generations later in 1816. Emanuel and his successors gradually built up a [[chemical]]-[[pharmaceutical]] [[factory]] that produced raw materials for pharmaceutical and other preparations.

In 1891, George Merck emigrated to the United States and set up Merck & Co. in New York as the US arm of the family partnership, E. Merck (named for Emanuel Merck), which is now [[Merck KGaA]]. In keeping with a national wartime policy, Merck & Co. was confiscated in 1917 and re-established as an independent American company. Until the end of [[World War II]], the company was led by [[George W. Merck]].  Today, the US company has about 51,000 (S&P NetAdvantage) employees in 120 countries with 31 factories worldwide. It is one of the world's seven largest pharmaceutical companies, exceeding the size of its German ancestor, which currently employs 41,000 people in 67 countries.

In 1965 Merck acquired [[Charles Frosst|Charles E. Frosst]] Ltd. of [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal]] (founded 1899) and created Merck-Frosst Canada, Inc., as its Canadian subsidiary and pharmaceutical research facility. Merck closed this facility in July 2010,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thestar.com/business/article/833712--montreal-plant-among-17-closed-by-drugmaker-merck | location=Toronto | work=The Star | title=Montreal plant among 17 closed by drugmaker Merck | date=July 8, 2010}}</ref> and the company was renamed '''Merck Canada''' in 2011.

In 2005, [[CEO]] [[Raymond Gilmartin]] retired following Merck's voluntary worldwide withdrawal of [[Vioxx]]. Former president of manufacturing [[Richard Clark (pharmacologist)|Richard Clark]] was named CEO and company [[president]].  Clark retired in October 2011 and Kenneth Frazier became CEO.

In November 2009, Merck announced that it would merge with competitor [[Schering-Plough]] in a US$41 billion deal.<ref>

==Case histories==
===Vioxx===
In 1999, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved Vioxx (known generically as [[rofecoxib]]), a Merck product for treating [[arthritis]].  Vioxx was stronger than existing medications, while easier on the stomach than established [[anti-inflammatory]] drugs such as [[naproxen]].  Vioxx became one of the most prescribed drugs in history.  According to internal e-mail traffic released at a later lawsuit, Merck had a list of doctors critical of Vioxx to be "neutralised" or "discredited." "We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live," wrote an employee. Also alleged were intimidation of researchers and impingement upon [[academic freedom]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/drug-company-drew-up-doctor-hit-list/story-fna7dq6e-1225693586492 |title=Vioxx maker Merck and Co drew up doctor hit list |last=Rout |first=Milanda |work=The Australian |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref>

Thereafter, studies by Merck and by others found an increased risk of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] associated with [[Vioxx]] use when compared with naproxen. There was no indication of this risk in the original [[placebo]]-controlled safety trials, and it was possible that the effect was more related to naproxen decreasing the risk of heart attacks than one of Vioxx increasing the risk. Merck adjusted the labeling of Vioxx to reflect possible cardiovascular risks in 2002.

On September 23, 2004, Merck received information about results from a [[clinical trial]] it was conducting that included findings of increased risk of heart attacks among Vioxx users who had been using the medication for over eighteen months.<ref>[http://finance.senate.gov/press/Gpress/2004/prg101504.pdf Finance.senate.gov]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>  On September 28, 2004, Merck notified the FDA that it was voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx from the market, and it publicly announced the withdrawal on [[September 30]]. The FDA has since recommended that Vioxx be put back on the market, but with a more prominent warning regarding cardiovascular risks on its label.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

On November 5, 2004 the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' published the results of its analysis of the available studies.  It concluded that "the unacceptable cardiovascular risks of Vioxx (rofecoxib) were evident as early as 2000..."<ref>[http://thelancet.com/journal/vol364/iss9446/full/llan.364.9446.early_online_publication.31178.1 Elsevier]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>  The journal's editors criticized Merck for having kept the drug on the market as long as it did before withdrawing it, and also criticized the FDA for its failure of regulatory oversight.

About 50,000 people have sued Merck claiming that they or their family members have suffered medical problems such as heart attacks or strokes after taking Vioxx.<ref name="NYT">[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/business/30drug.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&oref=slogin Courts Reject Two Major Vioxx Verdicts], ''[[The New York Times]], May 30, 2008</ref>  In 2005, Merck was found liable in the first case that went to trial and the plaintiff was awarded $253.4 million in damages; however, the judgement was subsequently reduced to $20 million and then, upon appeal, the verdict was reversed in 2008.<ref name="NYT"/>  In November 2007, Merck proposed to pay $4.85 billion to settle most of the pending Vioxx lawsuits.<ref>[http://news.idsk.com/viewer/story.php?CLIENT=INFOMAILER&NEWSID=lex-4R3Y-VNP0-TX31-W141 Merck proposes $4.85B Vioxx settlement]</ref><ref>{{Cite news

This proposed settlement is generally viewed by industry analysts and investors as a victory for Merck, considering that original estimates of Merck's liability reached as high as $50 billion. As of mid-2008, plaintiffs have prevailed in only three of the twenty cases that have reached juries, all with relatively small awards.<ref name="NYT"/>

On May 20, 2008, Merck was found liable for using deceptive marketing tactics to promote [[Vioxx]] and 30 states will split the $58 million settlement.  The amount is the largest multi-state settlement against a pharmaceutical company.<ref>[http://ktar.com/?nid=6&sid=842595&r=1   Arizona gets $2.3 Million from Vioxx Settlement] [[KTAR-FM|92.3 KTAR]] Retrieved on May 19, 2008</ref> All its new television pain-advertisements must be vetted by the Food and Drug Administration and changed or delayed upon request until 2018.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/21/business/21vioxx.html?_r=1&ref=business&oref=slogin Merck Agrees to Settlement Over Vioxx Ads], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 20, 2008]</ref>

===Mectizan===
In 1987, Merck & Co. began a program with [[UNICEF]] to donate its new drug [[Mectizan]] to "all that need it for as long as needed"<ref>[http://www.unicefusa.org/news/news-from-the-field/merck-pia.html Merck supports the worldwide fight against river blindness], [[UNICEF]]</ref> in an effort to combat [[Onchocerciasis]], also known as river blindness, primarily in Africa. Up to that point, the [[World Health Organization]] had fought the disease through the use of insecticides to lower the population of its primary vector, the [[Black Fly]].<ref>[http://www.stanford.edu/class/humbio103/ParaSites2005/Ivermectin/History.htm Ivermectin History], [[Stanford]], 2005</ref> However, when studies in the 1980s showed how effective the drug was at treating and preventing the disease, the WHO agreed to use it instead of its previous strategies. Merck's involvement is considered a key factor in the success against the disease all over the world,<ref>[http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol17no1/171heal1.htm Onchocerciasis: Africa's victory over river blindness.], Africa Recovery, Vol.17 #1 (May 2003), page 6 </ref> and the decision to donate the entirety of the drug to all those in need of it is used{{By whom|date=February 2012}} as a case study in corporate ethics today.

===Cordaptive===
On September 4, 2007, Merck & Co. introduced the experimental [[drug]] Cordaptive, which can both raise [[High density lipoprotein|HDL]] and lower [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] (combining an extended-release form of the B [[vitamin]] [[niacin]] with [[laropiprant]], a novel compound intended to inhibit [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] or redness of the face). Cordaptive caused 18% drop in levels of LDL-C00, a 26% drop in [[triglycerides]], and a 20% increase in  HDL-C. Merck's cholesterol statin drug Zocor has seen sales plunge since its patent expired in 2006.  In addition, Merck and partner Schering-Plough Corp. jointly market two other cholesterol drugs, [[Zetia]] and [[Vytorin]].<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070905/ap_on_he_me/merck_cholesterol_drug;_ylt=AgPQAmpTjrkSAQAwhr69xPis0NUE Yahoo.com, Merck niacin drug controls cholesterol]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>

On April 24, 2008, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) has recommended approval of the combination, to be marketed in Europe as Tredaptive.<ref>[http://www.merck.com/newsroom/press_releases/research_and_development/2008_0424.html   Merck & Co., Inc. press release - Two Merck Medicines Recommended for Approval in the European Union] Retrieved on April 30, 2008.</ref>

On April 28, 2008, the FDA issued a "not approvable" letter for Cordaptive.

===Phony medical journal===
From 2002 through 2005 the Australian affiliate of Merck sponsored the eight issues of a medical journal, the ''[[Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine]]'', published by [[Elsevier]]. Although it gave the appearance of being an independent peer-reviewed journal, without any indication that Merck had paid for it, the journal actually reprinted articles that originally appeared in other publications and that were favorable to Merck. The misleading publication came to light in 2009 during a personal injury lawsuit filed over Vioxx; 9 of 29 articles in the journal's second issue referred positively to Vioxx.<ref>{{cite news |author= Singer N |title= Merck paid for medical 'journal' without disclosure |work= The New York Times |date=2009-05-13 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/business/14vioxxside.html |accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref> In 2009, the CEO of Elsevier's Health Sciences Division, Michael Hansen, admitted that the practice was "unacceptable".<ref>{{cite press release

 | quote = It has recently come to my attention that from 2000 to 2005, our Australia office published a series of sponsored article compilation publications, on behalf of pharmaceutical clients, that were made to look like journals and lacked the proper disclosures. This was an unacceptable practice, and we regret that it took place.

===Medicaid overbilling===
A US Justice Department fraud investigation began in 2000 when allegations were brought in two separate lawsuits filed by whistleblowers under the [[False Claims Act]].<ref name="wapo"/> They alleged that Merck failed to pay proper rebates to [[Medicaid]] and other health care programs and paid illegal remuneration to health care providers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2008/February/08_civ_094.html |title=Merck to Pay More than $650 Million to Resolve Claims of Fraudulent Price Reporting and Kickbacks|publisher=US Department of Justice|date=2008-02-07 |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref> On February 7, 2008 Merck agreed to pay more than $650 million to settle charges that it routinely overbilled Medicaid for its most popular medicines. The federal government received more than $360 million, and 49 states and Washington, DC, over $290 million. One whistleblower received a $68 million reward.<ref name="wapo">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/07/AR2008020701336.html|title=Merck to Pay $650 Million In Medicaid Settlement|last=Johnson|first=Carrie|date=February 8, 2008|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=8 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmalot.com/2008/02/merck-to-pay-650m-over-medicaid-fraud/ |first=Ed|last= Silverman|title=Merck To Pay $670 Million Over Medicaid Fraud |publisher=Pharmalot.com |date=2008-02-07 |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref> Merck made the settlement without an admission of liability or wrongdoing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.merck.com/newsroom/news-release-archive/corporate/2008_0207.html|title=Merck Resolves Federal and State Investigations Related to Certain Past Pricing And Certain Past Sales and Marketing Activities|date=February 7, 2008|publisher=Merck|accessdate=8 February 2010}}</ref>

===Environmental record===
Merck & Co. once used [[methylene chloride]], an animal carcinogen on the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s list of pollutants, as an ingredient in some of its pharmaceuticals. Merck chemists and engineers subsequently replaced the compound with others having fewer negative environmental effects. Merck has also modified its equipment to protect the environment, installing a distributed control system that coordinates chemical reactions more efficiently and expedites manufacturing by 50 percent, eliminating the need for the disposal and storage of harmful waste. Biological oxygen demand has also been reduced.<ref>http://www.p2pays.org/ref%5C01/00155.pdf</ref>

In 1991, Merck's Kelco subsidiary was responsible for 1/3 of the [[volatile organic compound]] (VOC) emission pollution in the San Diego area. Ground level ozone was causing lung tissue damage by exposure to harmful bacteria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sdearthtimes.com/et1096/et1096s5.html |title=ET 10/96: Repairing a legacy of pollution by Kelco |publisher=Sdearthtimes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref>

In 1996 Merck paid $1.8 million for polluting the air. New machines were installed to reduce smog emissions by {{convert|680000|lb|abbr=on}} a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/016bcfb1deb9fecd85256aca005d74df/e96f05f182d3254b852570d8005e1207!OpenDocument |title=U.S. settles $1.8 million pollution case with Merck and Monsanto &#124; Newsroom &#124; US EPA |publisher=Yosemite.epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref>
