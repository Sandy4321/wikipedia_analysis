'''Mary Anning''' (21&nbsp;May 1799 <U+2013> 9&nbsp;March 1847) was a British [[fossil collector]], [[Fossil trade|dealer]] and [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] who became known around the world for a number of important finds she made in the [[Jurassic]] age marine fossil beds at [[Lyme Regis]] where she lived.<ref>Dennis Dean writes that Anning pronounced her name "Annin" (see {{harvnb|Dean|1999|p=58}}), and when she wrote it down for [[Carl Gustav Carus]], an aide to King [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]], she wrote "Annins" (see {{harvnb|Carus|1846|p=197}}).</ref> Her work contributed to the fundamental changes in scientific thinking about prehistoric life and the history of the earth that occurred in the early 19th century.

Anning searched for fossils in the area's [[Blue Lias]] cliffs, particularly during the winter months when landslides exposed new fossils that had to be collected quickly, before they were lost to the sea. It was dangerous work, and she nearly lost her life in 1833 during a landslide that killed her dog Tray. Her discoveries included the first [[ichthyosaur]] skeleton to be correctly identified, which she and her brother Joseph found when she was just twelve years old; the first two [[plesiosaur]] skeletons ever found; the first [[pterosaur]] skeleton located outside Germany; and some important fish fossils. Her observations played a key role in the discoveries that [[belemnoidea|belemnite]] fossils contained fossilised [[ink sac]]s, and that [[coprolite]]s, known as [[bezoar]] stones at the time, were fossilised faeces. When geologist [[Henry De la Beche]] painted ''[[Duria Antiquior]]'', the first widely circulated pictorial representation of a scene from prehistoric life derived from fossil reconstructions, he based it largely on fossils Anning had found, and sold prints of it for her benefit.

Anning's gender and social class prevented her from fully participating in the scientific community of 19th-century Britain<U+2014>dominated as it was by wealthy [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] gentlemen. She struggled financially for much of her life. Her family were poor, and as religious [[English Dissenters|dissenters]] were subject to legal discrimination. Her father, a cabinetmaker, died when she was eleven. She became well known in geological circles in Britain, Europe, and America, and was consulted on issues of anatomy as well as about collecting fossils. However, as a woman she was not eligible to join the [[Geological Society of London]], and she did not always receive full credit for her scientific contributions. Indeed she wrote in a letter: "The world has used me so unkindly, I fear it has made me suspicious of everyone."<ref name=Dickens/> The only scientific writing of hers published in her lifetime appeared in the ''[[Journal of Natural History|Magazine of Natural History]]'' in 1839, an extract from a letter which Anning had written to the magazine's editor questioning one of its claims.<ref name="Torrens1995">{{harvnb|Torrens|1995}}</ref> After her death her unusual life story attracted increasing interest. [[Charles Dickens]] wrote of her in 1865 that "[t]he carpenter's daughter has won a name for herself, and has deserved to win it."<ref name=Dickens/> In 2010 the [[Royal Society]] included Anning in a list of the ten British women who have most influenced the history of science.<ref name="mostInfluential"/>

==Life and career==
===Childhood===
[[File:Lyme Regis - Dorset dot.png|thumb|left|100px|alt=Map of the UK|[[Lyme Regis]], Dorset]] 
Anning was born in the southern coastal English town of [[Lyme Regis]] in Dorset. Her father, Richard, was a cabinetmaker who supplemented his income by mining the coastal cliff-side fossil beds near the town, and selling his finds to tourists. He married Mary Moore, known as Molly, on 8 August 1793 in [[Blandford Forum|Blandford]]. The couple moved to Lyme and lived in a house built on the town<U+2019>s bridge, and attended the Dissenter chapel on Coombe Street whose worshippers initially called themselves independents and later became known as [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]]. [[Shelley Emling]] writes that the family lived so close to the sea that the same storms that swept along the cliffs to reveal the fossils sometimes flooded the Annings' home, on one occasion forcing them to crawl out of an upstairs bedroom window to avoid being drowned.<ref name=Emling11/>

The table on which she displayed her fossils sat right outside the window to the cellar workshop seen to the right of the stairs.|alt2=Sketch of house with two large front windows on either side of a front door and next to the steps leading up from the street to the door are two partially open cellar doors.}}

Richard and Molly had ten children in all. The first child was born in 1794, and was named Mary. She was followed by Martha, who died almost at once; Joseph in 1796; and Henry in 1798, who died in infancy. In December that year the oldest child, then four years old, died after her clothes caught fire, possibly while adding wood shavings to the fire. The incident was reported in the ''[[Bath Chronicle]]'' on 27 December 1798: "A child, four years of age of Mr. R. Anning, a cabinetmaker of Lyme, was left by the mother for about five minutes ... in a room where there some shavings ... The girl's clothes caught fire and she was so dreadfully burnt as to cause her death." When another daughter was born just five months later, she was named Mary after her dead sister. At least four more children were born after her<U+2014>Henry, 1801; Percival, 1803; Elizabeth, 1804; and Richard, 1809<U+2014>but they all died within a couple of years, and only Mary and Joseph survived to adulthood.<ref name=Emling11>{{harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=11<U+2013>14}}</ref>

On 19 August 1800, when Anning was 15 months old, an event occurred that became part of local lore. She was being held by a neighbour, Elizabeth Haskings, who was standing with two other women under an elm tree watching an equestrian show being put on by a travelling company of horsemen, when lightning struck the tree. The three women were killed, but onlookers rushed the infant home where she was revived in a bath of hot water.<ref>{{harvnb|Cadbury|2000|pp=5<U+2013>6}}</ref> A local doctor declared her survival miraculous, and her family said that she had been a sickly baby before the event, but that subsequently she seemed to blossom. For years afterwards members of her community would attribute the child's curiosity, intelligence, and lively personality to the incident.<ref>{{harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=14<U+2013>16}}</ref> 

Her education was extremely limited. She was able to attend a Congregationalist Sunday school where she learned to read and write. Congregationalist doctrine, unlike that of the Church of England at the time, emphasised the importance of education for the poor. Her prized possession was a bound volume of the ''Dissenters' Theological Magazine and Review'', in which the family's pastor, the Reverend James Wheaton, had published two essays, one insisting that God had created the world in six days, the other urging dissenters to study the new science of geology.<ref>{{harvnb|Emling|2009|p=26}}</ref>

===Fossils as a family business===
{{see|Jurassic coast|List of fossil sites}}
[[Image:Blue lias cliffs at Lyme Regis.jpg|left|thumb|210px|alt=Cliff wall with layers of rock next to a rocky beach|[[Blue Lias]] cliffs, Lyme Regis]]
[[File:Golden Cap from Charmouth beach.jpg|left|thumb|210px|alt=Cliffs in the distance, seashore in the foreground|The Jurassic coast at [[Charmouth]], Dorset, where the Annings made some of their finds.]]

By the late 18th century Lyme Regis had become a popular seaside resort, especially after 1792 when the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] made travel to the European mainland dangerous for the English gentry, and increasing numbers of wealthy and middle class tourists were arriving there.<ref>{{harvnb|Cadbury|2000|p=4}}</ref> Even before Mary's time locals supplemented their income by selling them what were called 'curios'. These were fossils with colourful local names like 'snake-stones' (ammonites), 'devil's fingers' (belemnites), and 'verteberries' (vertebrae) to which were sometimes attributed medicinal and mystical properties.<ref>{{harvnb|Cadbury|2000|pp=6<U+2013>8}}</ref> Fossil collecting was in vogue in the late 18th and early 19th century, at first as a pastime, but gradually transforming into a science as the importance of fossils to geology and biology was understood. The source of the fossils was the coastal cliffs that surround Lyme, part of a geological formation known as the [[Blue Lias]]. The formation consists of alternating layers of [[limestone]] and [[shale]], laid down as sediment on a shallow seabed early in the Jurassic period (about 210<U+2013>195&nbsp;million years ago), and is one of the richest fossil locations in Britain.<ref>{{harvnb|McGowan|2001|pp=11<U+2013>12}}</ref> The cliffs could be dangerously unstable, especially in winter when rain caused landslides. It was precisely during the winter months that collectors were drawn to the cliffs because the landslides often exposed new fossils.<ref name="McGowan14-21"/> 

Their father, Richard, took Mary and Joseph on fossil-hunting expeditions to make extra money for the family, setting their discoveries out on a table outside their home to sell to tourists. It was a difficult time for England's poor. The French Revolutionary Wars and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] that followed them caused food shortages, the price of wheat almost tripled between 1792 and 1812, but wages for the working class remained almost unchanged. In Dorset the rising price of bread caused political unrest, even riots, and at one point Richard Anning was involved in organising a protest against food shortages.<ref>{{harvnb|Cadbury|2000|pp=4<U+2013>5}}</ref> In addition the family's religious views as dissenters<U+2014>not followers of the Church of England<U+2014>attracted further discrimination. Dissenters were not allowed into university or the army, and were excluded by law from several professions.<ref name=Emling11/> When the father died in November 1810 at age 44<U+2014>he had been suffering from [[tuberculosis]] and injuries he suffered from a fall off a cliff<U+2014> he left the family with no savings and a significant amount of debt, forcing them to apply for [[Poor Relief Act 1662|parish relief]].<ref>{{harvnb|Cadbury|2000|p=9}}</ref> They continued collecting and selling fossils together, and set up a table of curiosities near the coach stop at a local inn. Although the stories about Anning tend to focus on her successes, Dennis Dean writes that her mother and brother were astute collectors too, and her parents had sold significant fossils before the father's death.<ref name=Dean58>{{harvnb|Dean|1999|p=58ff}}</ref>
[[File:AnningIchthyosaurSkull.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=drawing of side view of a long thin skull with needle like teeth, and a large eye socket|Drawing from an 1814 paper by [[Sir Everard Home, 1st Baronet|Everard Home]] showing the ''[[Ichthyosaurus platyodon]]'' skull found by Joseph in 1811.]] 
Their first well-known find started in 1811, when Mary was just 12 years old. Joseph dug up a 4-foot [[ichthyosaur]] skull. Mary found the rest of the skeleton a few months later, Henry Hoste Henley of Sandringham, Norfolk, who was lord of the manor of Colway, near Lyme Regis, paid the family about <U+00A3>23 for it,<ref name=Sharpe15>Sharpe and McCartney, 1998, p. 15.</ref> and in turn sold it to [[William Bullock (collector)|William Bullock]], a well-known collector who displayed it at London. There it generated considerable interest, because at a time when most people in England still believed in the [[Genesis creation narrative|Biblical account of creation]], which implied that the earth was only a few thousand years old,<ref name ="acadamy_of_sci"/> it raised questions about the history of living things and of the earth itself. It was sold at auction in May 1819 as "Crocodile in a Fossil State" to [[Charles Konig]], of the [[British Museum]], who had already suggested the name ''Ichthyosaurus'' for it, for <U+00A3>45 and five shillings.<ref name=Howe12>{{harvnb|Howe|Sharpe|Torrens|1981|p=12}}</ref>
 
Mary's mother Molly initially ran the business after Richard's death even if it is unclear how much actual fossil collecting she did, and as late as 1821 she wrote to the British Museum to request payment for a specimen. Joseph's time was increasingly taken up by his apprenticeship to an [[upholsterer]], but he remained active in the fossil business at least until 1825. By that time Mary had assumed the leading role in the family business.<ref name="Torrens1995"/>

===Birch auction===
One of the family's keenest customers was Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch, later Bosvile, a wealthy collector from Lincolnshire who bought several specimens from them. In 1820 Birch became disturbed by the family's poverty. Having made no major discoveries for a year, they were at the point of having to sell their furniture to pay the rent, and so he decided to auction on their behalf the fossils he had purchased from them. He wrote to the palaeontologist [[Gideon Mantell]] on 5 March that year to say that the sale was "for the benefit of the poor woman and her son and daughter at Lyme, who have in truth found almost ''all'' the fine things which have been submitted to scientific investigation ... I may never again possess what I am about to part with, yet in doing it I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that the money will be well applied." The auction was held at Bullocks in London on 15 May 1820, and raised <U+00A3>400, over <U+00A3>26,000 in 2010. How much of that was given to the Annings is not known, but it seems to have placed the family on a steadier financial footing, and with buyers arriving from Paris and Vienna, the three-day event raised the family's profile within the geological community.<ref name=Dean58/>

===Fossil shop and growing expertise in risky occupation===
Anning continued to support herself selling fossils. Her primary stock in trade consisted of invertebrate fossils such as [[ammonite]] and [[belemnoidea|belemnite]] shells, which were common in the area and sold for a few shillings. [[Vertebrate]] fossils, such as ichthyosaur skeletons, sold for more but were much rarer.<ref name="McGowan14-21">{{harvnb|McGowan|2001|pp=14<U+2013>21}}</ref> Collecting them was dangerous winter work. In 1823, an article in ''The Bristol Mirror'' said of her: [[Image:Mary Anning.jpg|thumb|left|220px|alt=Sketch of woman in heavy clothing with top hat holding a rock hammer and looking down at a sandy beach|Sketch of Mary Anning at work by Henry De la Beche]]

{{Quotation|This persevering female has for years gone daily in search of fossil remains of importance at every tide, for many miles under the hanging cliffs at Lyme, whose fallen masses are her immediate object, as they alone contain these valuable relics of a former world, which must be snatched at the moment of their fall, at the continual risk of being crushed by the half suspended fragments they leave behind, or be left to be destroyed by the returning tide:{{ndash}} to her exertions we owe nearly all the fine specimens of Ichthyosauri of the great collections&nbsp;...<ref name="Torrens1995"/>}}

The risks of her profession were illustrated when on October 1833 she barely avoided being killed by a landslide that buried her black-and-white terrier, Tray, her constant companion when she went collecting.<ref name="McGowan14-21"/> She wrote to a friend, Charlotte Murchison, in November that year: "Perhaps you will laugh when I say that the death of my old faithful dog has quite upset me, the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment before my eyes, and close to my feet ... it was but a moment between me and the same fate."<ref>{{harvnb|Goodhue|2004|p=84}}</ref> 

As Anning continued to make important finds her reputation grew. On 10 December 1823, she found the first complete ''[[Plesiosaurus]]'', and in 1828 the first British example of the flying reptiles known as [[pterosaur]]s, called a flying dragon when it was displayed at the British Museum, followed by a ''[[Squaloraja]]'' fish skeleton in 1829.<ref name=TorrensODNB/> Despite her limited education, she read as much of the scientific literature as she could obtain, and often laboriously hand-copied papers borrowed from others. Palaeontologist Christopher McGowan examined a copy she made of an 1824 paper by [[William Daniel Conybeare|William Conybeare]] on marine reptile fossils and noted that the copy included several pages of detailed technical illustrations that he was hard pressed to tell apart from the original.<ref name="McGowan14-21"/> She also dissected modern animals including both fish and [[cuttlefish]] to better understand the anatomy of some of the fossils with which she was working. Lady Harriet Silvester, the widow of the former Recorder of the City of London, visited Lyme in 1824, and described Anning in her diary:
[[File:Mary Anning Plesiosaurus.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Drawing of partially complete skeleton of creature with long thin neck, small skull, and paddles|Letter and drawing from Mary Anning announcing the discovery of a fossil animal now known as ''Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus'', 26&nbsp;December 1823]]
{{Quotation|The extraordinary thing in this young woman is that she has made herself so thoroughly acquainted with the science that the moment she finds any bones she knows to what tribe they belong. She fixes the bones on a frame with cement and then makes drawings and has them engraved... It is certainly a wonderful instance of divine favour<U+2014>that this poor, ignorant girl should be so blessed, for by reading and application she has arrived to that degree of knowledge as to be in the habit of writing and talking with professors and other clever men on the subject, and they all acknowledge that she understands more of the science than anyone else in this kingdom.<ref name="UCMP">{{cite web|title=Mary Anning|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/anning.html|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology|accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref>}}

In 1826, at the age of 27, Anning managed to save enough money to purchase a home with a glass store-front window for her shop, Anning's Fossil Depot. The business had become important enough that the move was covered in the local paper, which noted that the shop had a fine ichthyosaur skeleton on display. Many geologists and fossil collectors from Europe and America visited Anning at Lyme, including the geologist [[George William Featherstonhaugh]], who called Anning a "very clever funny Creature,"<ref>{{harvnb|Berkeley|Berkeley|1988|p=66}}</ref> and who purchased fossils from her for the newly opened [[New York Academy of Sciences|New York Lyceum of Natural History]] in 1827. King [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]] visited her shop in 1844 and purchased an ichthyosaur skeleton for his extensive natural history collection.<ref>{{harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=98<U+2013>99, 190<U+2013>191}}</ref> The king's physician and aide, [[Carl Gustav Carus]], wrote in his journal:

{{Quotation|We had alighted from the carriage and were proceeding on foot, when we fell in with a shop in which the most remarkable petrifications and fossil remains<U+2014>the head of an ''Ichthyosaurus''<U+2014>beautiful ammonites, etc. were exhibited in the window. We entered and found the small shop and adjoining chamber completely filled with fossil productions of the coast ... I found in the shop a large slab of blackish clay, in which a perfect ''Ichthyosaurus'' of at least six feet, was embedded. This specimen would have been a great acquisition for many of the cabinets of natural history on the Continent, and I consider the price demanded, <U+00A3>15 sterling, as very moderate.<ref name=Carus/>}}

Carus asked Anning to write her name and address in his pocketbook for future reference<U+2014>she wrote it as "Mary Annins"<U+2014>and when she handed it back to him she told him: "I am well known throughout the whole of Europe."<ref name=Carus>{{harvnb|Carus|1846|p=197}} 
*also see {{harvnb|Gordon|1894|p=115}}</ref> As time passed, Anning's confidence in her knowledge grew, and in 1839 she wrote to the ''[[Journal of Natural History|Magazine of Natural History]]'' to question the claim made by an article that a recently discovered fossil of the prehistoric shark ''[[Hybodus]]'' represented a new genus, as she had discovered many years ago the existence of fossil sharks with both straight and hooked teeth.<ref>{{harvnb|Emling|2009|p=172}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Anning|first=Mary|title=Extract of a letter from Miss Anning |url=http://books.google.com/?id=epY5AAAAcAAJ&lpg=PA605&dq=%22Mary%20Anning%22%20Hybodus%20Natural%20History&pg=PA605#v=onepage&q=|journal=The Magazine of Natural History|volume=3|page=605|year=1839}}</ref> The extract from the letter that the magazine printed was the only writing of Anning's published in the scientific literature during her lifetime.<ref name="Torrens1995"/> Some personal letters written by her, such as her correspondence with Frances Augusta Bell, were also published while she was alive.<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|1825|pp=131<U+2013>133, 172<U+2013>173}}</ref>

===Interactions with the scientific community===
As a working-class woman, Anning was an outsider to the scientific community. At the time in Britain women were not allowed to vote (neither were men too poor to meet the property requirement), hold public office or attend university, and the newly formed but increasingly influential [[Geological Society of London]] did not allow women to become members, or even attend meetings as guests.<ref>{{harvnb|Emling|2009|p=40}}</ref> The only occupations generally open to working-class women were farm labour, domestic service, and work in the newly opening factories.<ref name="McGowan14-21"/>

Although Anning knew more about fossils and geology than many of the wealthy fossilists she sold to, it was always the gentlemen geologists who published the scientific descriptions of the specimens she found, often neglecting to mention her name. She became resentful of this.<ref name="McGowan14-21"/> Anna Pinney, a young woman who sometimes accompanied Anning while she collected, wrote: "She says the world has used her ill ... these men of learning have sucked her brains, and made a great deal of publishing works, of which she furnished the contents, while she derived none of the advantages."<ref>{{harvnb|McGowan|2001|pp=203<U+2013>204}}</ref> Torrens writes that these slights to Anning were part of a larger pattern of ignoring the contributions of working-class people in early-19th-century scientific literature. Often a fossil would be found by a quarryman, construction worker, or road worker who would sell it to a wealthy collector, and it was the latter who was credited if the find was of scientific interest.<ref name="Torrens1995"/>

Along with purchasing specimens, many geologists visited her to collect fossils or discuss anatomy and classification. Henry De la Beche and Anning became friends as teenagers following his move to Lyme, and he, Mary, and sometimes Mary's brother Joseph, went fossil-hunting together. De la Beche and Anning kept in touch as he became one of Britain's leading geologists.<ref name=Emling35>{{harvnb|Emling|2009|p=35}}</ref> [[William Buckland]], who lectured on geology at the University of Oxford, often visited Lyme on his Christmas vacations and was frequently seen hunting for fossils with Anning.<ref>{{harvnb|McGowan|2001|pp=26<U+2013>27}}
*{{harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=53<U+2013>56}}</ref> It was to him she made what would prove to be the scientifically important suggestion that the strange conical objects known as bezoar stones were really the fossilised faeces of ichthyosaurs or plesiosaurs. Buckland would name the objects [[coprolites]].<ref name="Rudwick154"/> In 1839 Buckland, Conybeare, and [[Richard Owen]] visited Lyme together so that Anning could lead them all on a fossil-collecting excursion.<ref>{{harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=173<U+2013>176}}</ref> She also sometimes assisted [[Thomas Hawkins (geologist)|Thomas Hawkins]] with his efforts to collect ichthyosaur fossils at Lyme in the 1830s. She was aware of his penchant to "enhance" the fossils he collected. She wrote: "he is such an enthusiast that he makes things as he imagines they ought to be; and not as they are really found...".<ref>{{harvnb|McGowan|2001|p=131}}</ref> A few years later there was a public scandal when it was discovered that Hawkins had inserted fake bones to make some ichthyosaur skeletons seem more complete, and later sold them to the government for the British Museum's collection without the appraisers knowing about the additions.<ref>{{harvnb|McGowan|2001|pp=133<U+2013>148}}</ref> The Swiss palaeontologist [[Louis Agassiz]] visited Lyme in 1834 and worked with Anning to obtain and study fish fossils found in the region. He was so impressed by her and her friend [[Elizabeth Philpot]] that he wrote in his journal: "Miss Philpot and Mary Anning have been able to show me with utter certainty which are the icthyodorulites dorsal fins of sharks that correspond to different types." He thanked both of them for their help in his book, ''Studies of Fossil Fish''.<ref name=Emling169/>

Another leading British geologist, [[Roderick Murchison]], did some of his first field work in southwest England, including Lyme, accompanied by his wife Charlotte. Murchison wrote that they decided Charlotte should stay behind in Lyme for a few weeks to "become a good practical fossilist, by working with the celebrated Mary Anning of that place...". Charlotte and Anning became lifelong friends and correspondents. Charlotte, who travelled widely and met many prominent geologists through her work with her husband, helped Anning build her network of customers throughout Europe, and Anning stayed with the Murchisons when she visited London in 1829. Anning's correspondents included [[Charles Lyell]], who wrote her to ask her opinion on how the sea was affecting the coastal cliffs around Lyme, and [[Adam Sedgwick]]<U+2014>one of her earliest customers<U+2014>who taught geology at the University of Cambridge and who numbered [[Charles Darwin]] among his students. [[Gideon Mantell]], discoverer of the dinosaur [[Iguanodon]], also visited her at her shop.<ref>{{harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=99<U+2013>101, 124<U+2013>125, 171}}</ref>

===Financial difficulties and change in church affiliation===

By 1830, because of difficult economic conditions in Britain that reduced the demand for fossils, coupled with long gaps between major finds, Anning was having financial problems again. Her friend the geologist Henry De la Beche assisted her by commissioning [[George Johann Scharf|Georg Scharf]] to make a lithographic print based on De la Beche's watercolour painting ''[[Duria Antiquior]]'' portraying life in prehistoric Dorset that was largely based on fossils Anning had found. De la Beche sold copies of the print to his fellow geologists and other wealthy friends and donated the proceeds to her. It became the first such scene from what later became known as [[deep time]] to be widely circulated.<ref>{{harvnb|Rudwick|1992|pp=42<U+2013>47}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=139<U+2013>145}}</ref> In December 1830 she finally made another major find, a skeleton of a new type of plesiosaur, which sold for <U+00A3>200.<ref name="Emling143">{{harvnb|Emling|2009|p=143}}</ref>

It was around this time that she switched from attending the local Congregational church, where she had been baptised, and in which she and her family had always been active members, to the Anglican church. It was prompted in part by a decline in Congregational attendance that began in 1828 when its popular pastor, John Gleed, a fellow fossil collector, left for the United States to campaign against slavery, to be replaced by the less likeable Ebenezer Smith. The greater social respectability of the established church, in which some of Anning's gentleman geologist customers such as Buckland, Conybeare and Sedgwick were ordained clergy, was also a factor. Anning, who was devoutly religious, actively supported her new church as she had her old.<ref name="Emling143"/>

She suffered another serious financial setback in 1835 when she lost most of her life savings, about <U+00A3>300, in a bad investment. Sources differ somewhat on what exactly went wrong. [[Deborah Cadbury]] says that she invested with a conman who swindled her and disappeared with the money,<ref>{{harvnb|Cadbury|2000|p=231}}</ref> but Shelley Emling writes that is not clear whether the man ran off with the money or whether he died suddenly leaving Anning with no way to recover the investment. Concerned about her financial situation, her old friend William Buckland persuaded the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]] and the British government to award her an annuity, known as a civil list pension, in return for her many contributions to the science of geology. The <U+00A3>25 annual pension gave her a certain amount of financial security.<ref>{{harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=171<U+2013>172}}</ref>

===Illness and death===
[[File:MaryAnningGravestone.jpg|thumb|160px|alt=Photo of upright gravestone|Gravestone of Anning and her brother Joseph in St Michael's churchyard.]]
Anning died from breast cancer at the age of 47 on 9 March 1847. Her work had tailed off during the last few years of her life because of her illness, and as some townspeople misinterpreted the effects of the increasing doses of [[laudanum]] she was taking for the pain, there had been gossip in Lyme that she had a drinking problem.<ref>{{harvnb|Brice|2001}}</ref> However, the regard she was held in by the geological community was shown in 1846 when, upon learning of her cancer diagnosis, the Geological Society raised money from its members to help with her expenses, and the council of the newly created [[Dorset County Museum]] made her an honorary member.<ref name="Torrens1995"/> She was buried on 15 March in the churchyard of [[Lyme Regis#The Church|St. Michael's]], the local parish church.<ref name=TorrensODNB>{{harvnb|Torrens|2008}}</ref> Members of the Geological Society contributed to a stained-glass window in her memory, unveiled in 1850. It depicts the six corporate ''[[works of Mercy|acts of mercy]]''<U+2014>feeding the hungry, giving drink to the thirsty, clothing the naked, sheltering the homeless, visiting prisoners and the sick, and the inscription reads: "This window is sacred to the memory of Mary Anning of this parish, who died 9 March AD 1847 and is erected by the vicar and some members of the Geological Society of London in commemoration of her usefulness in furthering the science of geology, as also of her benevolence of heart and integrity of life."<ref>{{harvnb|McGowan|2001|pp=200<U+2013>201}}</ref>

[[File:MaryAnningWindow.jpg|thumb|left|160px|alt=Photo of colourful stained class window showing human figures|Mary Anning's Window, St Michael's Church.]]
After her death, Henry De la Beche, president of the Geological Society, wrote a eulogy that he read to a meeting of the society and published in its quarterly transactions, the first such eulogy given for a woman. They were an honour normally only accorded fellows of the society, which did not admit women until 1904. The eulogy began: 
{{Quotation|I cannot close this notice of our losses by death without advertising to that of one, who though not placed among even the easier classes of society, but one who had to earn her daily bread by her labour, yet contributed by her talents and untiring researches in no small degree to our knowledge of the great [[Enalio-Saurians]], and other forms of organic life entombed in the vicinity of Lyme Regis ..."<ref>{{citation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YR0RAAAAIAAJ&pg=PR24&dq=I+cannot+close+this+notice+of+our+losses+by+death%22&hl=en&ei=n-iYTN2kCYrZnAfEsOjXDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=I%20cannot%20close%20this%20notice%20of%20our%20losses%20by%20death%22&f=false|title=Anniversary Address of the President|journal=The Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London|volume=4|year=1848|page=xxv}}</ref>}}

[[Charles Dickens]] wrote an article about her life in February 1865 in his literary magazine ''[[All the Year Round]]'' that emphasised the difficulties she had overcome, especially the scepticism of her fellow townspeople. He ended the article with: "The carpenter's daughter has won a name for herself, and has deserved to win it."<ref name=Dickens>{{harvnb|Dickens|1865|pp=60<U+2013>63}}</ref>

==Major discoveries==
===Ichthyosaurs===
[[File:Anning 1st ichthyosaur skeleton.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Rib, vertebrae, and pelvic bones in a stone matrix|Drawing of part of the skeletal remains of ''Temnodontosaurus platyodon'', the first ichthyosaur found by Anning from Everard Home's 1814 paper.]]

Anning's first famous discovery was made shortly after her father's death. In 1811 (some sources say 1810 or 1809) her brother Joseph found a 4&nbsp;ft (1.3m) skull, but failed to locate the rest of the animal.<ref name="Torrens1995" /> After Joseph told her to look between the cliffs at Lyme Regis and Charmouth, Mary found the skeleton<U+2014>17 feet long in all (5.2m)<U+2014>a few months later. The family hired workmen to dig it out in November that year, an event covered by the local press on 9 November, who identified the fossil as a crocodile.<ref name="Howe12"/>

Other ichthyosaur remains had been discovered in years past at Lyme and elsewhere, but the specimen found by the Annings was the first to come to the attention of scientific circles in London. It was purchased by the lord of a local manor,<ref name=Sharpe15/> who passed it to [[William Bullock (collector)|William Bullock]] for public display in London<ref name="Torrens1995"/> where it created a sensation. At a time when most people in England still believed in the [[Genesis creation narrative|Biblical account of creation]], which implied the earth was only a few thousand years old, and that species did not evolve or become extinct,<ref name ="acadamy_of_sci">[http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/otherPages/extinction.php "Fossils and Extinction"], The Academy of Natural Sciences. Retrieved 23 September 2010.</ref> the find raised questions in scientific and religious circles about what the new science of geology was revealing about ancient life and the history of the earth. Its notoriety increased when [[Sir Everard Home, 1st Baronet|Sir Everard Home]] wrote a series of six papers, starting in 1814, describing it for the Royal Society. The papers never mentioned who had collected the fossil, and in the first one he mistakenly credited the painstaking cleaning and preparation of the fossil performed by Anning to the staff at Bullock<U+2019>s museum.<ref name="Home1814">{{harvnb|Home|1814}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=33<U+2013>41}}</ref> Perplexed by the creature, Home kept changing his mind about its classification, first thinking it was a kind of fish, then thinking it might have some kind of affinity with the [[platypus|duck-billed platypus]] (only recently known to science); finally in 1819 he reasoned it might be a kind of intermediate form between salamanders and lizards, which lead him to propose naming it Proteo-Saurus.<ref name="Rudwick26-30">{{harvnb|Rudwick|2008|pp=26<U+2013>30}}</ref><ref name="Home1819">{{harvnb|Home|1819}}</ref> By then Charles Konig, an assistant curator of the British Museum, had already suggested the name ''Ichthyosaurus'' (fish lizard) for the specimen and that name stuck. Konig purchased the skeleton for the museum in 1819.<ref name="Rudwick26-30"/> The skull of the specimen is still in the possession of the Natural History Museum in London, but at some point it became separated from the rest of the skeleton, the location of which is not known.<ref>{{harvnb|Cadbury|2000|p=324}}</ref>  

Anning found several other ichthyosaur fossils between 1815 and 1819, including almost complete skeletons of varying sizes. In 1821 [[William Conybeare]] and [[Henry De la Beche]], both members of the Geological Society of London, collaborated on a paper that analysed in detail the specimens found by Anning and others. They concluded that ichthyosaurs were a previously unknown kind of marine reptile, and based on differences in tooth structure they concluded that there had been at least three species.<ref name="Rudwick26-30"/><ref name="Conybeare1821">{{harvnb|De la Beche|Conybeare|1821}}</ref> Also in 1821, Anning found the 20&nbsp;ft (6&nbsp;m) skeleton from which the species ''Ichthyosaurus platydon'' (now ''[[Temnodontosaurus platyodon]]'') would be named.<ref>{{harvnb|Cadbury|2000|p=101}}</ref> In the 1980s it was determined that the first ichthyosaur specimen found by Joseph and Mary Anning was also a member of ''Temnodontosaurus platyodon''.<ref>{{harvnb|McGowan|2001|p=210}}</ref>

===Plesiosaurs===
[[File:Anning plesiosaur 1823.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Drawing of partially complete skeleton of creature with long thin neck, small skull, and paddles|Drawing published in the Transactions of the Geological Society of the nearly complete ''Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus'' skeleton found by Anning in 1823.]]
Her next major discovery was a partial skeleton of a new type of marine reptile in the winter of 1820<U+2013>1821, the first of its kind to be found. William Conybeare named it ''Plesiosaurus'' (near lizard) because he thought it more like modern reptiles than the ichthyosaur had been, and he described it in the same 1821 paper he co-authored with Henry De la Beche on ichthyosaur anatomy. The paper thanked the man who bought the skeleton from Anning for giving Conybeare access to it, but does not mention the woman who discovered and prepared it.<ref name="Conybeare1821"/><ref>{{harvnb|McGowan|2001|pp=23<U+2013>26}}</ref>
The fossil was subsequently described as ''Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus'' and is the [[type (biology)|type specimen]] ([[holotype]]) of the species, which itself is the type species of the [[genus]]. In 1823 she discovered a second even more complete plesiosaur skeleton (the first one had been missing the skull). When Conybeare presented his analysis of plesiosaur anatomy to a meeting of the Geological Society in 1824, he again failed to mention Anning by name, even though she had collected both skeletons and had made the sketch of the second skeleton he used in his presentation. Conybeare's presentation was made at the same meeting at which William Buckland described the dinosaur ''[[Megalosaurus]]'' and the combination created a sensation in scientific circles.<ref>{{harvnb|McGowan|2001|p=75}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Conybeare|1824}}</ref>

{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Macrocephalus.jpg|image2=Anning plesiosaur.jpg|width=150|alt1=Photo of cast of skeleton of creatue with long curved neck, and paddles|caption1=Cast of "Plesiosaurus" ''macrocephalus'' found by Mary Anning in 1830, [[Mus<U+00E9>um national d'histoire naturelle]], Paris.|caption2=Skeleton of the "Plesiosaurus" ''macrocephalus'' given above as drawn by [[William Buckland]].|alt2=drawing of skeleton of creatue with long curved neck, and paddles}}
Conybeare's presentation followed the resolution of a controversy over the legitimacy of one of the fossils. The fact that the plesiosaur's long neck had an unprecedented 35 vertebrae raised the suspicions of the eminent French anatomist [[Georges Cuvier]] when he reviewed Anning's drawings of the second skeleton, and he wrote to Conybeare suggesting the possibility the find was a fake produced by combining fossil bones from different kinds of animals. Fraud was far from unknown among early 19th century fossil collectors, and if the controversy had not been resolved promptly the accusation could have seriously damaged Anning's ability to sell fossils to other geologists. Cuvier's accusation had resulted in a special meeting of the Geological Society earlier in 1824, which after some debate had concluded the skeleton was legitimate. Cuvier later admitted he had acted in haste and was mistaken.<ref>{{harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=81<U+2013>83}}</ref>

Anning discovered yet another important and nearly complete plesiosaur skeleton in 1830. It was named ''Plesiosaurus macrocephalus'' by William Buckland and described in an 1840 paper by [[Richard Owen]].<ref name="Torrens1995"/> Once again Owen mentioned the wealthy gentleman who had purchased the fossil and made it available for examination, but not the woman who had discovered and prepared it.<ref name="Emling143"/>

===Fossil fish and pterosaur===
[[Image:Anning Dimorphodon.jpg|thumb|left|alt=sketch|Joseph Anning's sketch of the ''Dimorphodon macronyx'' found by his sister, drawn with belemnite ink]] 
Anning found what a contemporary newspaper article called an "unrivalled specimen" of ''[[Dapedium|Dapedium politum]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Anonymous|1828}}</ref> This was a ray-finned fish, which would be described in 1828. In December of that same year she made an important find consisting of the partial skeleton of a [[pterosaur]]. In 1829 William Buckland described it as ''Pterodactylus macronyx'' (later renamed ''[[Dimorphodon]] macronyx'' by Richard Owen), and unlike many other such occasions, Buckland credited Anning with the discovery in his paper. It was the first pterosaur skeleton found outside Germany, and it created a public sensation when displayed at the British Museum. In December 1829 she found a fossil fish, ''[[Squaloraja]]'', which attracted attention because it had characteristics intermediate between sharks and [[Batoidea|rays]].<ref name="Torrens1995"/>

===Invertebrates and trace fossils===
Vertebrate fossil finds, especially of marine reptiles, made Anning's reputation, but she made numerous other contributions to early palaeontology. In 1826 she discovered what appeared to be a chamber containing dried ink inside a [[belemnoidea|belemnite]] fossil. She showed it to her friend Elizabeth Philpot who was able to revivify the ink and use it to illustrate some of her own ichthyosaur fossils, and other local artists were soon doing the same as more such fossilised ink chambers were discovered. Anning noted how closely the fossilised chambers resembled the ink sacs of modern [[squid]] and [[cuttlefish|cuttle fish]], which she had dissected to better understand the anatomy of fossil [[cephalopod]]s, and this led William Buckland to publish the conclusion that Jurassic belemnites had used ink for defence just as many modern cephalopods do.<ref>{{harvnb|McGowan|2001|p=20}}
*{{harvnb|Emling|2009|p=109}}</ref> It was also Anning who noticed that the oddly shaped fossils then known as "bezoar stones" were sometimes found in the abdominal region of ichthyosaur skeletons. She also noted that if such stones were broken open they often contained fossilised fish bones and scales, and sometimes bones from small ichthyosaurs. Anning suspected the stones were fossilised faeces and suggested so to Buckland in 1824. After further investigation and comparison with similar fossils found in other places Buckland published that conclusion in 1829 and named them [[coprolites]]. In contrast to the finding of the plesiosaur skeletons a few years earlier, for which she was not credited, when Buckland presented his findings on coprolites to the Geological Society he mentioned Anning by name, and praised her skill and industry in helping to solve the mystery.<ref name="Torrens1995"/><ref>{{harvnb|Rudwick|2008|pp=154<U+2013>155}}</ref>

==Impact and legacy==
[[File:Duria Antiquior.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Watercolour of prehistoric animals and plants living in the sea and on the nearby shore; foreground figures include pterosaurs fighting in the air above the sea and an ichthyosaur byting into the long neck of a plesiosaur.|The geologist [[Henry De la Beche]] painted the influential watercolour ''[[Duria Antiquior]]'' in 1830 based largely on fossils found by Anning.<ref name="Rudwick154"/>]]
 
Anning's discoveries became key pieces of evidence for [[extinction]]. Georges Cuvier had argued for the reality of extinction in the late 1790s based on his analysis of fossils of [[mammal]]s such as [[mammoth]]s. Nevertheless, until the early 1820s it was still believed by many scientifically literate people that animals did not become extinct<U+2014>in part because they felt that extinction would imply that God's creation had been imperfect; any oddities found were explained away as belonging to animals still living somewhere in an unexplored region of the earth. The bizarre nature of the fossils found by Anning, some like the [[plesiosaur]] so unlike any known living creature, struck a major blow against this idea.<ref>{{harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=48<U+2013>50, 88}}</ref>

The ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and [[pterosaur]] she found, along with the first [[dinosaur]] fossils which were discovered by [[Gideon Mantell]] and William Buckland during the same period, showed that during previous eras the earth was inhabited by creatures very different from those living today, and provided important support for another controversial suggestion of Cuvier's: that there had been an "[[Mesozoic|age of reptiles]]" when reptiles rather than mammals had been the dominant form of animal life. These discoveries also played a key role in the development in the 1820s of a new discipline of geohistorical analysis within geology that sought to understand the history of the earth by using evidence from fossils to reconstruct extinct organisms and the environments they lived in; this discipline eventually came to be called palaeontology.<ref>{{harvnb|Rudwick|2008|pp=57<U+2013>58, 72}}</ref> Illustrations of scenes from deep time (now known as [[paleoart]]), such as Henry De la Beche's ground-breaking painting ''Duria Antiquior'', helped convince people that it was possible to understand life in the distant past. De la Beche had been inspired to create the painting by a vivid description of the [[food chain]] of the [[early Jurassic|lias]] by William Buckland based on analysis of coprolites. The study of coprolites, pioneered by Buckland and Anning, would prove to be a valuable tool for understanding ancient ecosystems.<ref name="Rudwick154">{{harvnb|Rudwick|2008|pp=154<U+2013>158}}</ref>

Throughout the 20th century, beginning with H.A. Forde and his ''The Heroine of Lyme Regis: The Story of Mary Anning the Celebrated Geologist'' (1925), a number of writers saw Anning's life as inspirational. She was even the basis of Terry Sullivan's 1908 tongue twister, "She sells seashells," according to P.J. McCartney in ''Henry de la Beche'' (1978):<ref>{{citation|last=Appleby|first=Valerie|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tFH9VRMkiwMC&pg=PA714&dq=%22Mary+Anning%22+%22Geological+Society+of+London%22&hl=en&ei=pOWaTO2UIsr9nAeq-bTxDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=29&ved=0CMIBEOgBMBw#v=onepage&q=%22Mary%20Anning%22%20%22Geological%20Society%20of%20London%22&f=false|title=Ladies with hammers|journal=New Scientist|issue=29 November|year=1979|page=714}}</ref>
[[Image:Mary Anning by B. J. Donne.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=portrait of woman with bonnet, rock hammer, and small dog|Posthumous painting of Anning by B. J. Donne from 1847, based on the 1842 portrait]]

{{Quotation|<poem>She sells seashells on the seashore

Much of the material written about her was aimed at children, and tended to focus on her childhood and early career. Much of it was also highly romanticised and not always historically accurate. She has been referenced in several historical novels, most notably in ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1969) by [[John Fowles]], who was critical of the fact that no British scientist had named a species after her in her lifetime.<ref name="Torrens1995"/> As her biographer, Shelley Emling, noted, this contrasted with some of the prominent geologists who had used her finds, such as Buckland and [[Roderick Murchison]], who ended up with multiple fossil species named after them. The only person to name a species after her during her lifetime was the Swiss-American naturalist Louis Agassiz who named two fossil fish species after her<U+2014>''[[Acrodus anningiae]]'', and ''Belenostomus anningiae''<U+2014>and another after her friend [[Elizabeth Philpot]] in the early 1840s. Agassiz was grateful for the help the women had given him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834.<ref name="Emling169">{{harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=169<U+2013>170}}</ref> Other species, including the [[Ostracod]] Cytherelloidea anningi, and two genera, the [[Therapsida|therapsid]] reptile genus Anningia and the [[Bivalvia|bivalve]] mollusc genus Anningella, were named in her honour after her death.<ref name="Torrens1995"/><ref>{{citation|title=Encyclopedia of Paleontology|contribution=ANNING, MARY |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/routpaleont/anning_mary|format=CREDO subscription required|year=1999}}</ref> 

In 1999, on the 200th anniversary of her birth, an international meeting of historians, palaeontologists, fossil collectors and others interested in Anning's life was held in Lyme Regis.<ref>{{harvnb|McGowan|2001|p=203}}</ref> In 2005 the [[Natural History Museum]] added her, alongside scientists such as [[Carl Linnaeus]], [[Dorothea Bate]], and [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], as one of the gallery characters it uses to patrol its display cases.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Anning Session|publisher=Natural History Museum|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/education/school-activities/gallery-characters/mary-anning-session/index.html|accessdate=11 April 2010}}
