===Auditions===
The main auditions were held in 3 cities:  [[Manila]], on June 3 at the [[Philippine International Convention Center]]; [[Davao City]], on June 23 at the Waterfront Insular Hotel; and [[Cebu City]], on July 4 at Bigfoot Entertainment<U+2019>s International Academy of Film and Television. 

Fast-track screenings were also held at satellite venues in [[SM Supermalls]] located in key cities such as [[Baguio City]], [[Lucena City]], [[Batangas City]], [[Iloilo City]], and [[Cagayan de Oro City]] in May and June. Several fast-track auditions were also done in cities without an SM Mall such as [[Dagupan City]], [[Ilagan, Isabela]], [[Tacloban City]], and [[Zamboanga City]]. Applicants were asked to fill up necessary forms and to perform two songs before a set of judges, usually from the local radio and music industries.  Successful applicants of the Fast-Tracks were given a pass for the audition proper. ABC and its media partners [[Radio Mindanao Network]] and [[Manila Broadcasting Company]] provided free transportation, food and lodging to those who passed the main auditions.

A total of 169 aspirants received the Gold Pass from the three main judges.  119 were from Luzon and Metro Manila, while 17 and 33 were from Davao and Cebu respectively.  However, according to an article in Philippine Daily Inquirer, three Gold Passers backed out before the Theater Rounds. The reasons for backing out range from family problems to accepting an overseas job offer. <ref>[http://showbizandstyle.inq7.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=12460 Idol begins today], [[INQ7.net]], July 30, 2006 issue</ref> The remaining contenders battled it out during the Theater Eliminations that were held in Cultural Center of the Philippines from August 1 to 3. They were billeted at the [[Bayview Park Hotel]], where the provincial Gold Passers arrived via first-class in [[Super Ferry]], while the Luzon contenders were picked-up in selected SM Malls. It was from the Theater Eliminations that the "Top 24" finalists were selected.

Initially, the program was scheduled to begin on July 29, 2006, but ABC moved it to July 30, 2006 (a Sunday) to strengthen its Sunday line-up, when other local stations have talk shows and game shows on that day. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

====Rejected====
This is a list of notable contestants who were rejected at the auditions:

<!--Do not add contestants whose auditions were not televised. They will be added later when these contestants are became "televised"-->
{{hidden begin|header=List of notable auditioners who failed|ta2=left|ta1=left}}
*'''Ann Margarette Betia''' - Cayabyab questioned her performance of "Fallin'" as too much of [[Alicia Keys]].  She walks out crying, saying to the camera that if she won't become the ''Philippine Idol'', she will become the [[American Idol]].  Auditioned in Manila.
*'''Christopher Lumbab''' - he danced as he enters the audition room.  After singing his piece, his happy face suddenly shed tears, lamenting about how he lost his job because he skipped a day just to audition.  Although the judges did not made him through the next round, he tried to lift his spirits by dancing as he exited the room.  Auditioned in Cebu.
*'''Janrie Saplad''' - he tried to [[breakdance]] while singing [[The Calling]]'s "Wherever You Will Go".  Cayabyab asked who his choreographer was so he could kill him.  Auditioned in Cebu.
*'''Jawomar "Charlie" Maligayo''' - in his interview he "want(s) to dedicated" his audition to Holly, [[Hilary Duff]], [[Cueshe]], and the whole [[Cavite State University]].  Upon audition, he gave letters to the judges and [[selective mutism|refused to talk]] until he is instructed to sing.  His rendition of [[Selena]]'s "Dreaming Of You" did not get the judges' nod.  Auditioned in Manila.
*'''Jonard Moneva''' - a truck driver who is also an aspiring songwriter.  He sang one of his [[novelty song|novelty]] compositions about [[heartache]] and [[suicide]] for the judges, but Corrales advised him to pursue a career in Cebuano songwriting instead.  Auditioned in Cebu.
*'''Josemaria Seno''' - works as a production assistant for [[International Academy for Film and Television]] which is the venue for the Cebu Auditions.  His snap-happy rendition of "The Way You Look Tonight" prompted Cayabyab to stand up and instructed him to stand still as he sang.  There it was realized that his voice had flat notes.  After ejection, he claimed that it is "inebitabol" for him to be famous.
*'''Julieto Alquizar''' - made an ironically bad version of [[Simple Plan]]'s "[[Perfect (Simple Plan song)|Perfect]]" and begged to the judges in vain to give him another chance until he was whisked away by security personnel. Auditioned in Davao.
*'''Justice Regondola''' - credited as the first ever person to audition on the show as evidenced by his number 00001. Auditioned in Manila.
*'''Kyrley Sumagaysay''' - came from far-flung [[Zamboanga del Sur]] with nothing more than [[Philippine peso|P]]1,300 (around US$25).  Although her voice has potential, the judges decided that she is not Idol material.  The dramatic shots of her interview (such as staring at the sunset, or wind blowing on her face as she exits the venue) became a highlight. Auditioned in Cebu.
*'''Michelle Ortuoste''' - this [[Sultan Kudarat]] native tried to impress the judges by singing an operatic [[do-re-mi]] as she entered the audition room of Cebu.  She gave an opera rendition of [[The Lord's Prayer]], but failed to impress the judges. Auditioned in Cebu.
*'''Neil Simpson Antiquesa''' - his version of [[Beyonc<U+00E9>]]'s "Swing Low Sweet Chariot" led Magalona to conclude that Neil's voice sounded like a cross between a bird and a goat. Auditioned in Davao.
*'''Rolando Lim''' - messed up the lyrics of [[Gloria Estefan]]'s "Conga", prompting Magalona to sing "no way, no way" to the said tune. Auditioned in Manila.
*'''Winston Ko''' - a vocal impersonator who made a good impression of singer [[Jaya]], but his interpretation of [[Lani Misalucha]]'s "Bukas Na Lang Kita Mamahalin" (English:  I Will Just Love You Tomorrow) was so awful, Cayabyab did not know what the song is.  Auditioned in Davao. {{hidden end}}

====Notable events====
*On the first week, no contestants were eliminated, due to disrupted telephone and mobile phone services in many areas in Luzon caused by [[2006 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Xangsane (Milenyo)|Typhoon Milenyo]]. In the results show, the finalists still went through the scare of the familiar elimination routine: Agoncillo called 3 contestants to the area dubbed the "Hot Spot" before revealing that no one would be eliminated and that all votes would be carried over to the succeeding week. The reason this was done was that there were no official results at all to be announced to the public, according to sources from the network; the votes were not yet counted at the time. <ref> [http://www.mb.com.ph/ENTR2006100476213.html <U+2018>Idol<U+2019> eliminations moved to next Saturday] Manila Bulletin 10/4/06 Issue, Entertainment Section.</ref> ABC-5 Director for Creative and Entertainment Production Perci Intalan also clarified that the three finalists who were put in the "Hot Spot" (production had arbitrarily selected Marcelo, Cruz and Mateo) were not necessarily the bottom three. Intalan said, "We were not allowed to announce who the bottom three were because the votes will be carried over next week and it might affect the voting if people know who the bottom three were." <ref> [http://www.malaya.com.ph/oct05/ente1.htm Idol Results Shocking!] Malaya Newspaper 10/5/06 Issue, Entertainment Section.</ref>

*On the second week, two contenders were eliminated in view of the preceding week's non-eliminations.

*On the fourth week, no one was eliminated once again due to reports of disrupted voting (among [[Sun Cellular]] and [[Smart Communications|Smart]] subscribers). All votes amassed for this week were carried over to Week 5. Through the rest of the results night, each of the judges picked one finalist to give an encore performance: Cornejo picked Cruz, Corrales chose Marcelo, and Cayabyab picked Magdangal.

*Starting on the fifth week, performance nights were held on Sundays while elimination nights are on Mondays, as opposed to the previous setup of Saturday performances and Sunday eliminations. Also, voting time was shortened to 2 hours (from 22 hours).  This change was adopted (partly due to public clamor) to pattern the voting from ''[[American Idol]]'', which limits voting to a window of two hours after performance night.  On results night, two contenders were eliminated in light of the prior week's non-eliminations.

*On the seventh week, each finalist sang a song chosen for them by a fellow Idol based on these assigned pairings: Magdangal and Nieto, Marcelo and Mendoza, Chavez and Dingle. After the night's performances, Mo Twister expressed with certainty that Dingle would be eliminated the next night, the guest judge wagering that he would go to work in a dress for a week if his prediction proved wrong. Dingle was indeed eliminated the following night. 

*On the eighth week, each of the remaining 5 contestants performed two songs.  This was the reason cited for a thirty-minute extension for voting during that night.

*On the 9th week, the remaining 4 finalists gave "mini-concerts", each performing 2 song numbers with a short spiel to the audience in between.  On results night, Agoncillo initially called Marcelo and Nieto to the Hot Spot, then sent Nieto back and retained Marcelo.  Agoncillo then posed to Marcelo the scripted question of whom she thought should accompany her to the Hot Spot. When Marcelo picked Mendoza, Agoncillo confirmed the correctness of her choice, then immediately went on to reveal that Mendoza was the one eliminated.

*The tenth week was a special week to profile the final three finalists Marcelo, Magdangal, and Nieto.

====Finale====
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:2v1q3dk.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Mau Marcelo]] reprising her winning song "Try It on My Own" after being declared the first Philippine Idol.]] -->
On December 9, 2006, show held its performance night finale at the [[Araneta Coliseum]] dubbed ''The Big 3 at the Big Dome''. As denoted, the final group contained three finalists (Magdangal, Marcelo, and Nieto) rather than a final two and they each performed three songs, one personally chosen by the contesant, one by the judges and one by Sony BMG. Agoncillo hosted the performance night alone; he was then joined the next night by Heart Evangelista.

The next night at the same venue, the star-studded results show was held, headlined by Magdangal, Marcelo, and Nieto together with the rest of the Final 12. The show also included performances from [[Cuesh<U+00E9>]], [[Aiza Seguerra]], the [[SexBomb Girls]], [[G Toengi]], [[Hajji Alejandro]], and [[Gary Valenciano]], as well as resident judges [[Francis Magalona]] and [[Pilita Corrales]]. [[Ryan Cayabyab]] also performed his compositions by joining the finalists through his [[piano]] accompaniment. 

In what can be regarded as the climax of the show, the Final 12 and resident judges Corrales and Cayabyab performed a medley of songs composed by Cayabyab, including an original one which he made with finalist Miguel Mendoza entitled "Here I Am".

[[Mau Marcelo]] was voted as the first Philippine Idol, amassing about 35.26% of the vote. The vote was a hotly contested one with the runners-up earning about 33.84% and 30.90% of the votes. It was not revealed, however,  which runner-up garnered which percentage, but they each received PHP250,000. Aside from the title, Marcelo also earned a contract with Sony BMG, a management contract with an agency of [[Fremantle Media]]'s choice, a PHP1,000,000 non-exclusive contract with ABC, and a cash prize of PHP1,000,000.

===Post-''Idol''===
Runner-up [[Gian Magdangal]] is confirmed to have signed a non-exclusive contract to [[GMA 7|GMA]] network and is a regular on Sunday noon-time variety show [[SOP (Sobrang Okey Pare)]] starting [[January 7]], [[2007]]. Aside from the public announcement, Magdangal himself confirmed it on his [[Yahoo! Groups]] site. <ref> [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/philidol_gian/message/270 Gian Magdangal's Official Yahoo! Group]</ref> However, a stipulation in Magdangal's contract states that he is not supposed to mention "Philippine Idol" in any of his appearances on [[GMA 7|GMA]] Network, and this has been noticeable since his first appearance.  His current stint in GMA made him the first and only network talent among the Philippine Idol contestants as of the moment. <ref> [http://www.pep.ph/articles/news/11942.htm "SOP" lets go of co-hosts for major revamp] </ref>

On the other hand, winner Mau Marcelo still remains as the finalist with a recording contract with the [[Sony|Sony BMG]] company with the release of her new album entitled ''On My Own'' which also is the carrier track in the CD. She had also appeared on the ABS-CBN show ''[[ASAP (Variety Show)|ASAP '07]]'' alongside [[Sarah Geronimo]], [[Rachelle Ann Go]], [[Frenchie Dy]], and [[Yeng Constantino]], all winners of singing competitions themselves (''[[Star for a Night]]'', ''[[Search for a Star]]'', ''[[Star in a Million]]'', and ''Pinoy Dream Academy'').

Meanwhile, Drae Yba<U+00F1>ez was featured in the February 6, 2007 edition of the ABS-CBN late evening news program ''[[Bandila (TV program)|Bandila]]''. ''Philippine Idol'' was not explicitly mentioned in the report; rather, it focused on his charity work.

==Kakaibang Idol==
On September 23, 2006, a special edition was held for the contestants with the most notable auditions who didn't make the performance rounds and from the elimination round. The special edition was called the search for "Kakaibang Idol" (a very different Idol) because the seven auditioners' takes made an impact among viewers of the show. The following (in order of performance in the show), along with nicknames, are:
 
{{hidden begin|header=List of Kakaibang Idol contestants|ta2=left|ta1=left}}
*'''Jhonalene "Jhona" Sison''' - a band vocalist who wore an all-green [[anim<U+00E9>]]-inspired outfit and sang a pompous version of the ''[[Voltes V]]'' theme (<U+30DC><U+30EB><U+30C6><U+30B9><U+FF36><U+306E><U+3046><U+305F>, "Voltes V no Uta" by [[Mitsuko Horie]], Columbia Yurikago-kai, and [[Koorogi '73]]) before giving a song the judges could understand ("Moonraker" by [[Shirley Bassey]]). Auditioned in Manila and passed, but was eliminated halfway through the theater rounds.
*'''John Jerrico "Jeck" Perey''' - gave the judges and host some [[hula dance|hula]] lessons before he gave his low-toned, yet original performance of [[Josh Groban]]'s "Broken Vow". Auditioned in Manila and passed, but was eliminated at some point in the theater rounds.
*'''Lalaine Enriquez''' - wore black while giving an energetic performance of "Babae Po Ako ('Di Ako Bakla)" (I'm a Girl, I'm Not Gay) by [[Tuesday Vargas]]. Auditioned in Manila and passed, but was eliminated during the theater rounds.
*'''Leonard Ocampo''' - wore his "lucky" trench coat, but ended up pleading to the judges, especially an infuriated Cayabyab, for another chance because of his mediocre version of [[VST & Co.]]'s "Sumayaw, Sumunod" ("Dance and Follow"). Auditioned in Manila, but failed (as already implied). His trench coat get-up made him one of the contenders.
*'''Sheryll Ann "Shane" Romulo''' - She sang a very choreographed version of "Huwag Mo Akong Ligawan (Kuya, 'Wag Po)" ("Don't Date With Me (Master, Don't!)"; "Kuya," literally "elder brother," can mean a maid's male employer in this sense) which actually sounded like she had just breathed [[helium]]. Auditioned in Manila, but failed; it was shown only in parts. She was later picked because of the sheer hilarity of the audition.
*'''Win John Dacay''' - his mouthful rendition of "Joyful, Joyful" was masked by his sudden dance moves and frequent [[split (gymnastics)|splits]]. Auditioned in Cebu, but failed. He was even being compared to entertainer [[Mystica (singer)|Mystica]] because of his splits.
*'''Kenneth Paul "Yova" Alonzo''' - a male [[transexual]] whose nickname is derived from "Yobab", which is ''baboy'' or "pig" spelled backwards.  He auditioned wearing a purple parachute dress; impressed the judges with his soulful yet controlled rendition of [[Whitney Houston]]'s "Why Does It Hurt So Bad". Auditioned in Cebu and passed, but was shut out of the top 24. He was still chosen to be compete for the "Kakaibang Idol" edition for his resiliency in singing despite the ambiguity of his gender. {{hidden end}}

[[Image:0730214220 1.jpg|right|thumb|Kakaibang Idol contender Jhonalene Sison, also known as Anime Girl, during her Manila Auditions.]]

The songs that they each used during the auditions were the same ones which they performed that night except for Perey who performed [[Lara Fabian]]'s version of "Broken Vow" (he used the "his name" lyric rather than the "her name" lyric in Groban's version). Also, most of the performances were accompanied by back-up dancers, something the semi-finalists' performances never had.

The twelve finalists were present that night, but they only performed at the beginning and end of the show. Likewise, Magalona, Corrales, and Cayabyab took a back seat, appearing in clips taking their "time off" and near the end of the show. Taking over jury duties that night were comedic performers [[Ethel Booba]], [[Arnell Ignacio]], and [[Tuesday Vargas]].

Although that night was a breather night for the finalists, voting was still active, involving viewers to pick the performer who should be proclaimed "Kakaibang Idol." The next night, with the presence of the finalists, Magalona, Corrales, and Cayabyab, Yova Alonzo was chosen by the viewers as "Kakaibang Idol."

==''I <U+2665> Philippine Idol: Exclusive''==

[[Image:0902001822 0.jpg|right|thumb|Teaser ad of ''Philippine Idol Exclusive'''s teaser which shows Heart Evangelista]]
'''''I <U+2665> Philippine Idol: Exclusive''''', originally ''Philippine Idol: Exclusive'', is a thirty-minute daily program that features updates, news and behind-the-scene footages of the show. Since its premiere on August 14, 2006, a male voice talent (who also voices the plugs for ABC programs) has been facilitating the program, with appearances by Jmie Mempin who is also a production associate of ''Philippine Idol''.

Actress [[Heart Evangelista]] took over the show on [[September 4]], [[2006]]. Accordingly, ''Philippine Idol: Exclusive'' was  renamed ''I Love Philippine Idol: Exclusive'' with the heart shape reflecting the new host.<ref>{{cite news | first=Marinel R. | last=Cruz | pages=F-1 | title=Heart is 'Idol' host, too | date=September 3, 2006 | publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer | url=http://showbizandstyle.inq7.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=18645}}</ref>

==Controversies==
===Auditions===
A fast-track audition that was to be held at SM City Sta. Mesa was cancelled leading to complaints from hopefuls and parents.  After several hours of waiting, a representative of ABC-5 arrived and relocated each of the 160 frustrated applicants to other scheduled Fast-Track auditions. <ref>[http://news.inq7.net/entertainment/index.php?index=1&story_id=77267 <U+2018>''Philippine Idol''<U+2019> organizers no-show at mall audition], [[INQ7.net]], May 28, 2006 issue</ref>

Several Filipinos living in Mindanao reacted negatively to what the ''Philippine Idol'' judges said after a low Gold Pass turnout at the Davao Main Auditions, with Corrales (a [[Cebuano people|Cebuana]] herself) was quoted as: "Davao is not the place to look for an Idol.  All the good ones are in Cebu." <ref>[http://showbizandstyle.inq7.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=7118 No 'Idols' Here], [[INQ7.net]], June 28, 2006 issue</ref> Corrales later clarified in the Wildcard Round that she said such a statement because of the low turnout in the Davao auditions and the even lower Gold Pass output; she further said that "Davao's best talents" might probably have already auditioned in Manila.

===ABS-CBN's talent piracy===
Another controversy came out when ABC confirmed that a Gold Passer (later identified in the show's official website as Czarina Rosales <ref>[http://www.philippineidol.com/articles/features1_0806.html ''Philippine Idol'', The Journey Has Just Begun], [http://www.philippineidol.com ''Philippine Idol'' Official Website Features]</ref>) was pirated by [[ABS-CBN]]'s ''[[Pinoy Dream Academy]]'', the Philippine franchise of ''[[Star Academy]]''. Sources said that some employees of ABS-CBN even approached a judge to <U+201C>just let (some of) the contestants go.<U+201D> <ref>[http://showbizandstyle.inq7.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=13803 ABC-5 Confirms Talent 'Piracy'], [[INQ7.net]], August 7, 2006 issue</ref>

This came after news that ABS-CBN wanted to co-produce ''Philippine Idol'' with ABC, but was denied.<ref>[http://news.inq7.net/common/print.php?index=1&story_id=74107&site_id=23 Was ABS-CBN eyeing <U+2018>Idol<U+2019> co-prod deal with ABC 5?] [http://www.inq7.net INQ7.net]. Published, April 30, 2006; accessed August 13, 2006.</ref>

However, ABS-CBN, through a letter sent to the [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]], the newspaper that published the said report, denied the allegations, saying that they successfully staged competitions without poaching contestants from other contests and would fully respect a contestant's choice in which competition one would join.<ref>[http://showbizandstyle.inq7.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=14947 Feedback], p.F3, Philippine Daily Inquirer,

In the aftermath of the "talent piracy" issue, ABC sent a formal letter of complaint to ABS-CBN, alleging that three Gold Passers of Philippine Idol became contestants of rival Pinoy Dream Academy.  ABS-CBN did not comment on the letter, as neither of the three talents questioned became a finalist of that show.<ref>{{cite news | title=Heart, Host ng Philippine Idol Exclusive! | date=September 2, 2006 | publisher=Pilipino Star Ngayon}} (Article written in Tagalog language; no online version)</ref>

===Vote padding===
Upon the announcement of the Top 4 Male finalists, many viewers of the show had negative reactions regarding its format. Some were shocked, some disappointed, and others were left complaining. Apparently, two of the contestants that were favored by the judges based on their performances failed to make the cut. Instead, two others who had rather bad reviews from the jurors took the spot. Thus, many critics concluded that Philippine Idol is just another "popularity contest" rather than a singing competition. One of the judges, Ryan Cayabyab, mentioned that people should not be "kampante" or complacent regarding any of the contestants status on the show. Instead, he advised them to keep on voting for their favorites because of the show's factors such as its uncertainty. <ref> [http://www.philippineidol.com/features/features0906_3.html Philippine Idol Fans, Not Happy With The Voting Results] Philippine Idol Official Website </ref> This criticism about the show being a mere "popularity contest" was also reflected during the Women's Semi-finals, as talent critics believed that two contenders that failed the cut should had have made the Top 4. The critics also noted that the viewers did not take heed to the judges' remarks about the contender's performance. <ref>[http://www.yehey.com/entertainment/music/article.aspx?c=136&id=131902 Popularity reigns on Philippine Idol] Yehey! Entertainment </ref> Columnist Nestor U. Torre of the [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] stated in his article about the format that the results revealed that viewers were not yet knowledgeable or objective enough to pick the first Idol and he also pointed the compromised voting on "subjective campaigns" from some of the semi-finalists' backers.<ref>{{cite news | first=Nestor U. | last=Torre | title=Text votes compromise search for best on <U+2018>Philippine Idol<U+2019> | date=September 9, 2006 | publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer | page=F1 | url=http://showbizandstyle.inq7.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=19953}}</ref> Torre would later use the reason of the other finalists' "vote-generating machines" in a later article against the show's mainly SMS-based voting system in his column.<ref>{{cite news | first=Nestor U. | last=Torre | title=Viewfinder: Images on my TV screen | date=October 2, 2006 | publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer | page=F1 | url=http://showbizandstyle.inq7.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=24349}}</ref> 

This fear can be supported on a report published by the [[Manila Bulletin]] about some contestants buying their way to the top, eliminating Yba<U+00F1>ez and Lazaro-Bainbrige. Cayabyab divulged that he didn't expect the way people voted and would see if that trend will continue in the next week. He admitted however that it was all part of the game.<ref>{{cite news | first=Kaye | last=Villagomez | title=Are <U+2018>Idol<U+2019> contestants buying their way to the top? | date=October 11, 2006 | publisher=Manila Bulletin | url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2006/10/11/ENTR2006101176707.htm}}</ref>

During the Results Show of the Wildcard Round, Mau Marcelo jokingly said that Philippine Idol is "not a singing contest" but rather as "pagandahan" (beauty contest), which received a thunderous applause and laughter (especially from Cayabyab).  Her statement was interpreted by fans in two ways: as a way of venting out her frustrations in the voting process; or as a means of sarcasm (she, along with the judges, was disappointed because of the top 8 result).  In a later interview at I <U+2665> Philippine Idol: Exclusive!, she said that she did not mean anything. And instead of being criticized by the voting public, she was supported by the majority thus making her part of the Top 12. Marcelo later apologized on the Finale's post-results show press conference.<ref>[http://showbizandstyle.inq7.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=37689 Lucena singer chosen first "Philippine Idol"] by Marinel Cruz, Delfin Mallari Jr. [[INQ7.net INQ7.net]].
