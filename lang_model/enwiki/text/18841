== The 2011 Israeli Social Justice Protests ==

=== Background ===

{{Main|2011 Israeli housing protests}}

The '''2011 Israeli social justice protests''' ({{lang-he|<U+05DE><U+05D7><U+05D0><U+05EA> <U+05E6><U+05D3><U+05E7> <U+05D7><U+05D1><U+05E8><U+05EA><U+05D9>}}), [[#Naming|which are also referred to by various other names in the media]], are a series of ongoing demonstrations in [[Israel]] beginning in July 2011 involving hundreds of thousands of protesters from a variety of [[socio-economic]] and religious backgrounds opposing the continuing rise in the [[cost of living]] (particularly housing) and the deterioration of public services such as health and education. A common rallying cry at the demonstrations was the chant; "The people demand social justice!".

As the protests expanded during [[August 2011]], the demonstrations began to also focus on other related issues relating to the social order and power structure in Israel. 

The housing protests which sparked the first demonstrations began as a result of a [[Facebook]] protest group that initially led hundreds of people to establish [[tents]] in the [[Rothschild Boulevard]] in the center of [[Tel Aviv]], an act which soon gained momentum, media attention and began a public discourse in Israel regarding the [[Israel's housing bubble|high cost of housing]] and living expenses. Soon afterwards, the protests spread to many other major [[cities in Israel]] as thousands of Israeli protesters began establishing tents in the middle of central streets in major cities as a means of protest. As part of the protests, several mass demonstrations have been held across the country, in which hundreds of thousands of people have participated.

A major focus of the protests have been what organizers have termed ''[[social justice]]''. Part of the movement is about changing the social order, and the economic system. Calls to topple the government were made by some parts of the protests.<ref name="Sheafer">{{cite news|title=Scale of social justice protests surprises experts |url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=233324|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|author=Melanie Lidman|date=11 August 2011|accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> Criticism of the protests includes accusations of a political agenda rather than a social one with revelations of funding from specific left-wing individuals and organizations like [[S.
