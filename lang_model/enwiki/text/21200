'''Dwayne Douglas Johnson'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Ge-La/Johnson-Dwayne-The-Rock.html|title=Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson Biography|accessdate=2008-04-13|publisher=Notable Biographies}}</ref> (born [[May 2]], [[1972]]),<ref name="filmreference"/> better known by his former [[ring name]] '''The Rock''', and occasionally credited as '''Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson''', is an [[United States|American]] [[actor]] and former [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]].<ref name="wwebio"/> Johnson was also a collegiate football player, and in 1991, he was part of the Miami Hurricanes' [[NCAA Division I-A national football champions|national championship]] team. He later played for the [[Calgary Stampeders]] in the [[Canadian Football League]], but was cut two months into the season. This led to his decision to become a professional wrestler, like his grandfather, [[Peter Maivia]] and his father [[Rocky Johnson]].

He gained mainstream fame as a standout in [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE), then known as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), from 1996 to 2004. Johnson was quickly given a push in WWE, first as "Rocky Maivia", and then as "The Rock", a member of the [[Nation of Domination]]. Two years after he joined the WWF, Johnson won the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]], and became one of the most popular wrestlers within the company for his engaging interviews. Since 2001, he has focused on an acting career, though he still makes occasional WWE appearances for promotional purposes. His last in-ring appearance was at [[WrestleMania XX]] in 2004. 

Johnson was a nine-time world champion in his career, including a record-setting seven-time WWE Champion; his last reign was as [[Undisputed Championship|WWE Undisputed Champion]] in 2002. He also won the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] twice and is a former five-time [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Champion]]. He also was the winner of the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|2000 Royal Rumble]].

Johnson is also an actor, with his first leading role coming in 2001, in ''[[The Scorpion King]]''. For this film, he received the highest salary for an actor in his first starring role, earning [[United States dollar|$]]5.5 million. He has since starred in movies such as ''[[Be Cool]]'' and ''[[The Game Plan (film)|The Game Plan]]''. In 2008, he was nominated for Best Movie Actor at the [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards|Kid's Choice Awards]] for his role in ''The Game Plan''.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Dwayne Johnson, the son of Ata ([[married and maiden names|n<U+00E9>e]] Maivia) and  [[professional wrestler]] [[Rocky Johnson|"Soulman" Rocky Johnson]], was born in [[Hayward, California]].<ref name="filmreference">{{cite web | url = http://www.filmreference.com/film/3/Dwayne-Johnson.html | title = Dwayne Johnson Biography (1972-) | accessdate = 2008-04-13 | publisher = Film Reference}}</ref> His maternal grandfather, "High Chief" [[Peter Maivia]], was also a professional wrestler.

He went to such schools as [[President William McKinley High School]] in [[Hawaii]].

Johnson graduated from the University of Miami in 1995 with a degree in [[criminology]].<ref name="islandconnections" />

Johnson continued his football career in 1995, joining the [[Calgary Stampeders]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] after being passed over by the NFL, but he was cut two months into the season.<ref name="calgarystampeders">{{cite web | url = http://calsun.canoe.ca/Sports/Football/2007/09/24/4521230-sun.html | title = Sticking to the Gameplan | accessdate =2007-09-27 | author = Tim Baines}}</ref>

Miami plans to rename the Hurricanes' locker room in Johnson's honor.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.comcast.net/entertainment/index.jsp?cat=ENTERTAINMENT&fn=/2007/10/02/778132.html | title=`The Rock' Gives $1M to Miami Football | accessdate=2007-10-02 }}</ref>

=== Personal life ===
Johnson married Dany Garcia on [[May 3]] [[1997]], a day after his 25th birthday.<ref name="split" /> His best man at the wedding was fellow wrestler and long-time family friend [[Tonga Fifita|Tonga "Haku" Fifita]]. Johnson and his wife have a daughter, Simone Alexandra, born [[August 14]] [[2001]].<ref name="split" /> On [[June 1]] [[2007]], Johnson and Garcia announced that they would splitting up after 10 years of marriage. They indicated that their parting was amicable and that they would spend the rest of their lives together as best friends.<ref name="split">{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20041195,00.html|title=Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson & Wife Split Up|author=Julie Jordan|publisher=People.com|accessdate=2007-06-04|date=[[June 1]] [[2007]]}}</ref>

In 2000, Johnson delivered a speech at the [[2000 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]].<ref name="wwebio" /> Because his mother, Ata Maivia, had royal blood, Samoan [[Malietoa Tanumafili II|King Malietoa Tanumafili II]] bestowed Johnson with the noble title of ''Seiuli'' during his visit to Samoa in July 2004.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rock<U+2019>s Royal Homecoming|url=http://www.pacificmagazine.net/issue/2004/10/01/the-rocks-royal-homecoming|accessdate=2008-05-13|publisher=Pacific Magazine}}</ref> He is a supporter of the [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoan national rugby team]], as the team's website during the run-up to the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] showed him holding a personalized Manu Samoa jersey with "The Rock" emblazoned on the back.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manusamoa.com.ws/|title=Manu Samoa|accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref>

== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment ==
=== Training and Rocky Maivia (1996) ===
Along with his father and grandfather, several members of Johnson's family are current and former professional wrestlers, including his uncles, the [[Wild Samoans]] (Afa and Sika Anoa'i) and cousins, such as [[Solofa Fatu|Rikishi]], [[Matt Anoa'i|Rosey]], and [[Eddie Fatu|Umaga]].<ref name="m&cbio"/> When he declared his intention to join the family business, his father resisted, but agreed to train his son himself, warning him that he would not go easy on him.<ref name="islandconnections"/> With help from veteran wrestler [[Pat Patterson]], Johnson had several tryout matches with WWE in 1996; he defeated [[Steve Lombardi|The Brooklyn Brawler]] at a house show, and lost the others to [[Chris Candido]] and [[Owen Hart]].<ref name="m&cbio"/>  Impressed by his talent and charisma, Johnson was signed to a deal after a short stint for "seasoning" in [[Jerry Lawler]]'s [[United States Wrestling Association]], where he wrestled under the ring name "Flex Kavana".<ref name="OWOW"/> While there, he won the [[USWA World Tag Team Championship]] twice with Bart Sawyer in the summer of 1996.<ref name="OWOW"/><ref name="uswatag"/>

Johnson made his WWF debut as Rocky Maivia, which combined his father and grandfather's ring names; Johnson was initially reluctant to the idea, but was persuaded to go ahead with the name by Vince McMahon and Jim Ross.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rock|first=The|coauthors=Layden, Joe|title =The Rock Says...|publisher=Harper Collins Publishers Inc.|date=2000|location=Chapter 10, "Rocky Maivia"|pages=146|isbn=0-06-039298-3}}</ref> In addition to tacking on the nickname "The Blue Chipper," the WWF played up his connection to his father and grandfather, calling him the company's first third-generation wrestler.<ref name="wwebio"/>

Johnson, who was first portrayed as a clean-cut [[List of professional wrestling slang#B|babyface]], was pushed heavily from the start despite his lack of in-ring experience. He debuted at [[Survivor Series (1996)|Survivor Series]] in November 1996 and was the sole survivor,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1996/results/|title=Survivor Series 1996 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> and he won the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] from [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] on ''[[WWE Raw|RAW]]'' on [[February 13]] [[1997]], after only three months in the company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997/raw021397|title=WWF Thursday RAW: February 13, 1997|publisher=The Other Arena|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322532|title=Rocky Maivia's first Intercontinental Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> Fans, however, quickly grew sick of the one-dimensional good guy character, thanks in part to the exploded popularity of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]].<ref name="slam"/> As a result, a regular occurrence during Johnson's matches was the fans' angry chants of ''"Die Rocky Die!"'' and ''"Rocky Sucks!"''<ref name="slam"/><ref name="OWOW">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/r/rock.html|title=The Rock Profile|accessdate=2008-04-13|publisher=Online World Of Wrestling}}</ref>

=== Nation of Domination and feuding with DX (1997<U+2013>1998) ===
{{main|Nation of Domination}}
After losing the Intercontinental Championship to Owen Hart on the April 28, 1997 edition of ''RAW is WAR'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997/raw042897|title=WWF RAW: April 28, 1997|publisher=The Other Arena|accessdate=2008-03-18}}</ref> and returning from an injury, Johnson was allowed to [[List of professional wrestling slang#T|turn]] [[List of professional wrestling slang#H|heel]]. He joined the Nation of Domination with Faarooq, D'Lo Brown and Kama, using the nickname "'The Rock' Rocky Maivia," which was quickly shortened to just "The Rock."<ref name="nation">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/n/nation-of-domination.html|title=Nation of Domination Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> During that time, Johnson attacked and insulted the fans in his [[Promo (professional wrestling)|promos]]. In sharp contrast to the overly positive persona of Rocky Maivia, The Rock was a charismatic bully, eventually driving out the group leader, [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]] in February 1998.<ref name="nation"/> The Rock also referred to himself in the [[Grammatical person|third person]], starting many sentences with ''"The Rock says..."''<ref name="nation"/>

Johnson was soon recognized for cutting arguably the best promos in the industry. In his 2000 autobiography, Johnson attributed this skill to his exceptional performance in [[speech communication]]s classes at Miami, in which he earned "A" grades. At [[In Your House#In Your House 19: D-Generation X|In Your House: D-Generation X]], Austin defeated The Rock in less than six minutes to retain the Intercontinental title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/inyourhouse19.html|title=In Your House 19: D-Generation X results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> The following night on ''RAW is WAR'', Austin was ordered by [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]] to forfeit the WWF Intercontinental Championship, which Austin handed over to The Rock before hitting the [[Stunner (professional wrestling)|Stone Cold Stunner]] on him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997/raw120897|title=WWF RAW: December 8, 1997|publisher=The Other Arena|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322552|title=The Rock's second Intercontinental Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> Rock spent the end of 1997 and the beginning of 1998 feuding with both Austin and [[Ken Shamrock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/198811511/results/|title=Royal Rumble 1998 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm14/results/|title=WrestleMania XIV official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-03-19|}}</ref>

Johnson next feuded with Faarooq, who was angry at The Rock for usurping his position. The two had a title match at [[Over the Edge: In Your House|Over the Edge]], where Rock retained the Intercontinental belt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/inyourhouse22.html|title=In Your House 22: Over the Edge 1998 results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> The Rock then moved into a feud with [[Triple H]] and [[D-Generation X]]. Nation members fought DX while The Rock fought Triple H over the Intercontinental Championship. They first had a [[Professional wrestling match types|two out of three falls match]] at [[WWF Fully Loaded#1998|Fully Loaded]] for Rock's title, where Rock retained the belt in controversial fashion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/inyourhouse23.html|title=In Your House 23: Fully Loaded 1998 results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> This led to a [[ladder match]] at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]] where Rock lost the belt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam07/history/1998/results/|title=SummerSlam 1998 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> At [[Breakdown: In Your House|Breakdown]], Rock defeated Ken Shamrock and [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat]] [[List of professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]] to become the #1 contender to the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] before feuding with fellow Nation member [[Mark Henry]], effectively disbanding the Nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/breakdown98.html|title=In Your House 24: Breakdown 1998 results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/judgementday98.html|title=In Your House 25: Judgment Day 1998 results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref>

=== The Corporation (1998-1999) ===
{{main|The Corporation (professional wrestling)|l1=The Corporation}}
Johnson's popularity as The Rock propelled him to the WWF Championship. The Rock began to conduct many entertaining interviews, and thus he [[List of professional wrestling slang#G|got over]] with the fans. Fan reaction effectively [[List of professional wrestling slang#T|turned]] him [[List of professional wrestling slang#F|face]], and he began to feud with Mr. McMahon, who said he has a ''"problem with the people"'' and thus he should target the "People's Champion" (as The Rock claimed himself to be). A double-turn occurred at [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], when The Rock defeated the then-[[List of professional wrestling slang#H|heel]] Mankind in the finals of the "Deadly Game" tournament<ref name="rock1wwe"/> for the vacant [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]],<ref name="Survivor Series - Rock vs Mankind">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1998/mainevent/|title=The Rock def. Mankind to become new WWE Champion|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> to become the first world heavyweight champion of African American descent in WWF history and the youngest WWF Champion at the time. At the end of the match, The Rock applied a [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]] on Mankind. As he did this, [[Montreal Screwjob|McMahon called for the bell to be rung]] and then ordered for The Rock to be declared the winner.<ref name="Survivor Series - Rock vs Mankind"/><ref name="rock1wwe">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/3044541401|title=The Rock's first WWE Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref>

With the plan coming to fruition, The Rock turned heel again and sided with Vince McMahon and [[Shane McMahon]] as the crown jewel of The Corporation [[List of professional wrestling slang#S|stable]]<ref name="rock1wwe"/>. This was also a start of a double turn, as Mankind was kicked out of The Corporation and made a face turn.<ref name="corporation">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/c/corporation.html|title=The Corporation Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> Later, The Rock had his own pay-per view [[In Your House#In Your House 26: Rock Bottom|Rock Bottom: In Your House]] where he had a rematch against Mankind for the WWF Championship. Mankind won by submission but Mr. McMahon said that since The Rock did not tap out that The Rock would retain his title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/rockbottom98.html|title=In Your House 26: Rock Bottom results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref><ref name="corporation"/> The Rock began a feud with Mankind over the WWF Championship, during which the title changed hands back and forth between the two, first during the main event of the [[January 4]] [[1999]] edition of ''RAW is WAR'', when Mankind defeated The Rock with the help of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1999/raw010499|title=Monday Night RAW: January 4, 1999|publisher=The Other Arena|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> The Rock captured his second WWF Championship in an [["I Quit" Match]] at [[Royal Rumble (1999)|Royal Rumble]] in early 1999,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881143/results/|title=Royal Rumble 1999 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/3044541412|title=The Rock's second WWE Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> when a pre-recorded sample of Mankind saying ''"I quit"'' from an interview segment was played over the sound system. This latest reign did not last long, however. In a match that counter-programmed the [[Super Bowl]] halftime show on [[January 31]] [[1999]], Mankind pinned The Rock using a [[forklift]] in an [[List of professional wrestling match types#Empty Arena match|Empty Arena Match]] where the competitors used everything from bags of popcorn to garbage to punish each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/99.htm|title=WWF results, 1999|publisher=Angelfire|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> This feud lasted until February 15 edition of ''RAW is WAR'', where The Rock won his third WWF Championship in a ladder match after [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]] chokeslammed Mankind off a ladder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1999/raw021599|title=Monday Night RAW: February 15, 1999|publisher=The Other Arena|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/30445414121|title=The Rock's third WWE Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref>

With Mankind out of the way, The Rock had to defend his WWF Championship at [[WrestleMania XV]], but lost the belt to Austin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm15/mainevent/|title=Stone Cold vs. The Rock for the WWE Championship|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> Rock lost the title rematch to Austin at [[WWE Backlash#1999|Backlash: In Your House]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/backlash/history/backlash1999/mainevent/|title=WWE Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin def.

Rock eventually made his second face turn after being betrayed by Shane McMahon and established a feud with [[The Undertaker]], Triple H and the [[Corporate Ministry]]. During this feud, he sometimes found himself fighting alongside Steve Austin.

=== The Rock 'n' Sock Connection (1999) ===

Later on, still as a face, besides feuding with Triple H, The Rock also feuded with [[Monty Sopp|Mr. Ass]] over the summer of 1999, including a "Kiss My Ass" match at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam07/history/1999/results/|title=SummerSlam 1999 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> In the fall of the same year, The Rock found himself in several singles and tag championship opportunities.

The team was also involved in a segment which occurred on ''RAW is WAR'' called ''"This Is Your Life,"'' in which Mankind brought out people from The Rock's past, such as his high school girlfriend and gym teacher.

=== Feuds for the WWF Championship (2000<U+2013>2001) ===
At [[Royal Rumble (2000)|Royal Rumble]] in early 2000, The Rock entered in the [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble match]] and lasted until he and [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]] were the final two men. In the final moment of the match, The Big Show was seemingly going to dump The Rock over the top rope in a running [[powerslam]]-like position, but when they got to the apron The Rock reversed the throw, sending the Big Show to the outside floor and then came back up.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/198811411/mainevent/|title=The Rock (No. 24) wins the Royal Rumble Match|accessdate=2008-03-20 |publisher=WWE}}</ref> The Rock's feet, however, hit the floor first, although those watching the event did not see that. The Big Show attempted to prove that The Rock's feet, not his, touched the ground first. He provided video footage showing that he was the rightful winner. Despite that, the decision that The Rock had won the Rumble match could not be reversed, so a number one contender's match for the WWF Championship at [[WWE No Way Out#2000|No Way Out]] was held, which saw the Big Show come out on top after [[Shane McMahon]] interfered, knocking The Rock in the head with a steel chair as he attempted to finish off his opponent with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Elbow drop|People's Elbow]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2000/results/|title=No Way Out 2000 official results|accessdate=2008-03-20 |publisher=WWE}}</ref> The Rock later defeated The Big Show on [[March 13]] [[2000]] edition of ''RAW is WAR'' to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at [[WrestleMania 2000]] in a [[List of professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Fatal Four-Way Elimination match]] where The Big Show and Mick Foley competed, as well.<ref name="raw00">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/2000.html|title=Raw 2000 results|accessdate=2008-03-20 |publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref><ref name="wrestlemania00">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm16/results/|title=WrestleMania 2000 official results|accessdate=2008-03-20|publisher=WWE}}</ref> Each competitor had a McMahon in their corner; for Triple H, his on-screen wife and then off-screen girlfriend [[Stephanie McMahon]]; for Mick Foley, the matriarch [[Linda McMahon]]; for The Rock, Vince McMahon; and in Big Show's corner, Shane McMahon.<ref name="wrestlemania00"/><ref name="wrestlemania00event">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm16/mainevent/|title=Triple H w/ Stephanie McMahon vs. Mick Foley w/ Linda McMahon vs. Big Show w/ Shane McMahon vs. The Rock w/ Mr. McMahon|accessdate=2008-03-20|publisher=WWE}}</ref> Triple H retained the title when Vince turned on The Rock, giving him two chair shots, allowing Triple H to pin The Rock for the three-count.<ref name="wrestlemania00event"/><ref name="oww-wrestlemania00">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlemania2000.html|title=WrestleMania 2000 results|accessdate=2008-03-20|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>

Over the next couple of months The Rock feuded with Triple H over the WWF Championship.

In 2001, The Rock continued his feud with Angle over the WWF Championship and eventually settled it at [[WWE No Way Out#2001|No Way Out]].
