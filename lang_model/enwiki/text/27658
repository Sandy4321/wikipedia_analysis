'''''Werribee Open Range Zoo''''' is a [[zoo]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[Australia]], focusing on displaying Australian and African animals. It is part of the Zoological Parks and Gardens Board which also includes [[Melbourne Zoo]] and [[Healesville Sanctuary]], and is located on the [[Werribee River]] in [[Werribee Park]], adjacent to the Werribee Mansion. It was originally agistment land to the Melbourne Zoo.

Once visitors have entered the Open Range Zoo, they can book for and take a bus which runs according to the expected demand - usually at least every twenty minutes on weekends and public holidays. The safari tour normally lasts an hour and takes up to 72 people, not including the guide. Photos are encouraged, but drinking, eating and smoking are not allowed on the bus. The safari tour begins with the loading of the bus near the Meerkat Bistro and Function Centre.

After seeing Australian animals, like the [[emu]], the [[brolga]] and the [[pelican]], the first savannah animal on the tour is the [[hippo]]. The tour goes on to the animals of the grassland, like [[zebra]], [[waterbuck]], [[giraffe]], [[ostrich]], and [[rhinoceros]], as well as the [[camel]] and the [[oryx]]. The animals are kept 'open range,' and often young are not released until they have bonded with the mother.

There is also a simulated African village, with many educational and entertaining features, including a mock scenario of an African ranger and his adventures tracking lions, and an interactive soundscape walk with simulated lion sounds surrounding the walker. As well as the safari tour, there are two independent trails that visitors may follow: the Pula Reserve Walking Trail (800 metres/approximately 40 minutes) which focuses on African animals, including lions and meerkats, and the Volcanic Plains Walk (500 metres/approximately 30 minutes), which focuses on Australian animals, like the wallaby and kangaroo.

Educational institutions may use the Learning Centre and the zoo's educational programs to further reinforce the learning experience. Various programs are offered, and teach more about the history and geography of animals in their environments. The Learning Centre is close to the entry of the park, as are the toilets and first aid.

In addition to the standard safari tour, visitors can also book various 'specialty' tours, including open vehicle and canoe safaris, as well as close encounters with lions or rhinos. Due to their popularity, it is recommended that visitors considering these tours phone in advance to make a booking.

Werribee Open Range Zoo has also an animal/adoption sponsorship program which is used for gifts and other altruistic purposes.
