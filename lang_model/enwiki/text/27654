{{History of Singapore}}

The '''Sook Ching massacre''' ({{zh|c=<U+8085><U+6E05><U+5927><U+5C60><U+6BBA>}}) was a systematic [[extermination]] of perceived hostile elements among the [[Chinese in Singapore]] by the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese military]] during the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore]], after the [[United Kingdom|British]] colony [[Battle of Singapore|surrendered]] on 15 February 1942 during the [[Second World War]]. Sook Ching was later extended to include [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] [[British Malaya|Malayans]] as well. The massacre took place from 18 February to 4 March 1942 at various places in the region.

The term ''Sook Ching'' ({{lang|zh|<U+8085><U+6E05>}}) means "a purge through cleansing" in Chinese and it was referred to as the ''Kaky<U+014D>shukusei'' ({{lang|ja|<U+83EF><U+50D1><U+7C9B><U+6E05>}}), or "purging of Chinese") by the Japanese. The Japanese also referred to it as the ''Shingap<U+014D>ru Daikensh<U+014D>'' ({{lang|ja|<U+30B7><U+30F3><U+30AC><U+30DD><U+30FC><U+30EB><U+5927><U+691C><U+8A3C>}}), lit. "great inspection of Singapore".

Although the term "Sook Ching" appeared as early as 1946, it was not commonly used in the Chinese [[Newspaper|press]] or other publications until the 1980s. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The National Heritage Board of Singapore uses this term in its publications.<ref>[http://www.s1942.org.sg/s1942/moff/exhibition1.htm Memories At Old Ford Factory - National Archives of Singapore, National Heritage Board]</ref><ref name="Sook Ching Centre">[http://heritagetrails.sg/content/586/Sook_Ching_Centre.html Sook Ching Centre]</ref>

Today, the memories and reflections of those who lived through these dark war years have been captured at exhibition galleries in Memories at Old Ford Factory, the site of the former Ford Motor Factory where the British surrendered to the Japanese on 15 February 1942.<ref>[http://www.a2o.com.sg/a2o/public/html/publication.jsp Access to Archives Online - Our Recent Publications]</ref>

The current Japanese term for the massacre is ''Shingap<U+014D>ru Kaky<U+014D>gyakusatsujiken'' ({{lang|ja|<U+30B7><U+30F3><U+30AC><U+30DD><U+30FC><U+30EB><U+83EF><U+50D1><U+8650><U+6BBA><U+4E8B><U+4EF6>}}), literally "(the) Singapore Chinese massacre".

There is no dispute in scholarly circles that the massacre took place. However, Japanese and Singaporean sources disagree about the death toll. According to [[Hirofumi Hayashi]] (see next section), the [[Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] "accepted that the Japanese military had carried out mass killings in Singapore...During negotiations with Singapore, the Japanese government rejected demands for reparations but agreed to make a <U+201C>gesture of atonement<U+201D> by providing funds in other ways."  

==Massacre Planned Before Japanese Occupation==

[[Hayashi Hirofumi]] is professor of politics at [[Kanto-Gakuin University]] and the Co-Director of the Center for Research and Documentation on Japan<U+2019>s War Responsibility. He writes that the massacre was planned before-hand, and that "the Chinese in Singapore were regarded as anti-Japanese even before the Japanese military landed." It is also clear from the passage below that the massacre was to be extended also to the Chinese in Malaya.

<blockquote>
It is important to note that the purge was planned before Japanese troops landed in Singapore. The military government section of the 25th Army had already drawn up a plan entitled, "Implementation Guideline for Manipulating Overseas Chinese" on or around 28 December 1941.[9] This guideline stated that anyone who failed to obey or cooperate with the occupation authorities should be eliminated. It is clear that the headquarters of the 25th Army had decided on a harsh policy toward the Chinese population of Singapore and Malaya from the beginning of the war. According to Onishi Satoru,[10] the Kempeitai officer in charge of the Jalan Besar screening centre, Kempeitai commander Oishi Masayuki was instructed by the chief of staff, Suzuki Sosaku, at Keluang, Johor, to prepare for a purge following the capture of Singapore. Although the exact date of this instruction is not known, the Army headquarters was stationed in Keluang from 28 January to 4 February 1942...

Clearly, then, the Singapore Massacre was not the conduct of a few evil people, but was consistent with approaches honed and applied in the course of a long period of Japanese aggression against China and subsequently applied to other Asian countries. To sum up the points developed above, the Japanese military, in particular the 25th Army, made use of the purge to remove prospective anti-Japanese elements and to threaten local Chinese and others in order to swiftly impose military administration.

==Definition of target group==
After the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese military]] occupied Singapore, they were aware that the local [[ethnic Chinese]] held strong loyalty to either their former colonial master [[United Kingdom|Britain]] or the Republic of [[History of the Republic of China|China]]. Some wealthy Chinese had been financing the Chinese [[National Revolutionary Army]] led by [[Chiang Kai-Shek]] in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] through a series of fund-raising [[propagandist]] events. The Japanese military authorities, led by General [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]], decided on a policy of "eliminating" those who harboured strong [[anti-Japanese sentiment]]s.

The Japanese military authorities defined the following as "undesirables":{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
*Activists in the [[China Relief Fund]].
*Wealthy men who had contributed generously to the Fund.
*Adherents of [[Tan Kah Kee]], leader of the [[Nanyang National Salvation Movement]].
*[[Hainan]]ese, perceived to be [[communist]]s.
*China-born Chinese who came to Malaya after the Second Sino-Japanese War.
*Men with [[tattoo]]s, perceived to be [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]] members (Chinese gangsters)
*Chinese who joined the [[Dalforce|Singapore Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army]].
*Civil servants and those who were likely to sympathise with the British, such as [[Justice of the Peace|Justices of the Peace]], and members of the [[Legislative Council]].
*People who possessed arms and were likely to disrupt public security.

Gen. Yamashita instructed the ''[[Syonan]]'' garrison to cooperate with the ''Syonan [[Kempeitai]]'', the Japanese [[military police]] to "punish hostile Chinese severely".

==The massacre==
===The "screening"===
After the fall of Singapore, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Masayuki Oishi]], commander of No. 2 Field Kempeitai, set up his headquarters in the YMCA Building at [[Stamford Road]] as the Kempeitai East District Branch. The Kempeitai prison was in [[Outram, Singapore|Outram]] with branches in Stamford Road, [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]] and the [[South Bridge Road|Central Police Station]]. A residence at the intersection of [[Smith Street, Singapore|Smith Street]] and [[New Bridge Road]] formed the Kempeitai West District Branch.

Under Lieutenant-Colonel Oishi's command were 200 regular Kempeitai officers and another 1000 auxiliaries who were mostly young and rough peasant soldiers. Singapore was divided into sectors with each sector under the control of an officer. The Japanese set up designated "screening centers" all over Singapore to gather and "screen" all Chinese males between the ages of 18 and 50.<ref name="s1942.org.sg">[http://www.s1942.org.sg/s1942/dir_defence7.htm Japanese Occupation - Massacre of Chinese Populace]</ref><ref name="youtube.com">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQvvNdxSTgw&feature=related Discovery Channel programme - History Of Singapore <U+65B0><U+52A0><U+5761><U+7684><U+6B77><U+53F2> (II) Part 2]</ref>
Those who were thought to be "anti-Japanese" would be eliminated. Sometimes, women and children were also sent for inspection as well.

The following passage is from an article from the National Heritage Board: 
<blockquote>
The inspection methods were indiscriminate and non-standardised.  Sometimes, hooded informants identified suspected anti-Japanese Chinese; other times, Japanese officers singled out <U+201C>suspicious<U+201D> characters at their whim and fancy.  Those who survived the inspection walked with <U+201C>examined<U+201D> stamped on their faces, arms or clothing; others were issued a certificate.  The unfortunate ones were taken to remote places like Changi and Punggol, and unceremoniously killed in batches.<ref name="Sook Ching Centre"/>
</blockquote>

According to the ''A Country Study: Singapore'' published by the Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress:

<blockquote>
All Chinese males from ages eighteen to fifty were required to report to registration camps for screening. The Japanese or military police arrested those alleged to be anti-Japanese, meaning those who were singled out by informers or who were teachers, journalists, intellectuals, or even former servants of the British. Some were imprisoned, but most were executed.<ref>http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+sg0027) Singapore -
Shonan: Light of the South</ref>
</blockquote>

The ones who passed the "screening" <ref name="s1942.org.sg"/> would receive a piece of paper bearing the word "Examined" or have a square ink mark stamped on their arms or shirts. Those who failed would be stamped with triangular marks instead.  They would be separated from the others and packed into trucks near the centers and sent to the killing sites.

===The killings===
There were several sites for the killings, the most notable ones being [[Changi Beach Park]], [[Punggol]] Beach and [[Sentosa]] (or [[Pulau Blakang Mati]]). The Punggol Beach Massacre cost the lives of 300 to 400 Chinese, who were shot at Punggol Beach on 28 February 1942 by the [[Hojo Kempei]] firing squad. The victims were some of the 1000 Chinese males detained by the Japanese after a door-to-door search along Upper [[Serangoon]] Road. Several of these men had [[tattoo]]s, a sign that they could be [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]] members.

The current site of the popular Changi Beach Park was the site of one of the most brutal killings in Singapore's history. On 20 February 1942, 66 Chinese males were lined up along the edge of the sea and shot by the military police. The beach was the first of the killing sites of the Sook Ching massacre, with another one at [[Tanah Merah]]. Another site was Berhala Reping at Sentosa Beach (now [[Serapong Golf Course]] after [[land reclamation]]). Surrendered [[United Kingdom|British]] gunners awaiting Japanese internment buried some 300 bullet-ridden corpses washed up on the shore of Sentosa. They were civilians who were transported from the docks at [[Tanjong Pagar]] to be killed at sea nearby.

In a quarterly newsletter, the National Heritage Board of Singapore published the account of the life story of a survivor named Chia Chew Soo whose father, uncles, aunts, brothers and sisters were bayoneted one by one by Japanese soldiers in Simpang Village.<ref>[http://www.nhb.gov.sg/resources/Online_Newsletter/heritageVol9Issue2.pdf Newsletter of the National Heritage Board April - June 2003 p.5 Memories of War - National Archives of Singapore]</ref> 
This is a strong testimony that many killings by the Japanese were indiscriminate.

=== Extension to Malaya ===
At the behest of Lieutenant-Colonel [[Tsuji Masanobu]], the Japanese High Command's Chief of Planning and Operations, Sook Ching was extended to the rest of Malaya, particularly [[Penang]]. However, in these rural areas the population was less concentrated and hence the Japanese lacked sufficient time and manpower to conduct a full "screening" of the Chinese population. The Japanese still proceeded with a widespread indiscriminate massacre of the Chinese population though.<ref>''Lords of the Rim'' by Sterling Seagrove</ref><ref>''Southeast Asian culture and heritage in a globalising world: diverging identities in a dynamic region Heritage, culture, and identity'' eds. Brian J. Shaw, Giok Ling Ooi. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2009. Chapter 6 "Nation-Building, Identity And War Commenmoration Spaces In Malaysia And Singapore", article by Kevin Blackburn, pp.93-111</ref> The killings ceased on 3 March.

== Death toll ==
The figures of the death toll vary. Official Japanese statistics show fewer than 5000 while the Singaporean Chinese community claims the numbers to be around 100,000. [[Lee Kuan Yew]], the founding Prime Minister who ruled Singapore from 1959 to 1990, said in a Discovery Channel programme that the estimated death toll was, "Somewhere between 50,000 to 100,000 young men, Chinese".<ref name="youtube.com"/>

In an interview on 6 July 2009 with [[National Geographic]], Lee Kuan Yew said: <blockquote>I was a Chinese male, tall and the Japanese were going for people like me because Singapore had been the centre for the collection of ethnic Chinese donations to Chongqing to fight the Japanese. So they were out to punish us. They slaughtered 50,000 - perhaps as high as 90,000 but verifiable numbers would be about 50,000. But for a stroke of fortune, I would have been one of them..<Ref>[http://www.news.gov.sg/public/sgpc/en/media_releases/agencies/pmo/transcript/T-20091228-1 TRANSCRIPT OF MINISTER MENTOR LEE KUAN YEW<U+2019>S INTERVIEW WITH MARK JACOBSON FROM NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC ON 6 JULY 2009 (FOR NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE JAN 2010 EDITION)]</Ref></blockquote>
Hirofumi Hayashi in another paper says that the death toll "needs further investigation".
<blockquote>
According to the diary of the Singapore garrison commander, Major General Kawamura Saburo, the total number reported to him as killed by the various Kempeitai section commanders on 23 February was five thousand(14). This was the third day of mop-up operations when executions were mostly finished. It is said in Singapore that the total number killed was forty or fifty thousand; this point needs further investigations.[http://www32.ocn.ne.jp/~modernh/eng01.htm]
</blockquote>
Having witnessed the brutality of the Japanese, Lee made the following comments: "But they also showed a meanness and viciousness towards their enemies equal to the Huns'. Genghis Khan and his hordes could not have been more merciless. I have no doubts about whether the two atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were necessary. Without them, hundreds of thousands of civilians in Malaya and Singapore, and millions in Japan itself, would have perished.<ref>Lee Kuan Yew. The Singapore Story: Memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew. Singapore: Times, 1998. [59-60]</ref>

According to Chalmers Johnson, the Japanese slaughtered as many as 30 million Filipinos, Malays, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Indonesians and Burmese, at least 23 million of them ethnic Chinese, in Asia.<ref>[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n22/chalmers-johnson/the-looting-of-asia London Review of Books - ''The Looting of Asia'', Chalmers Johnson]</ref>

==Aftermath==
[[File:Sook Ching Centre site.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The Sook Ching Centre site memorial stands at [[Hong Lim Complex]] in [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown.]]]]

In 1947, after the Japanese surrender, the British authorities in Singapore held a [[war crime]]s trial for the perpetrators of the Sook Ching Massacre. Seven Japanese officers - Lieutenant-General [[Takuma Nishimura]], Lieutenant-General [[Saburo Kawamura]], Lieutenant-Colonel [[Masayuki Oishi]], Lieutenant-Colonel [[Yoshitaka Yokata]], Major [[Tomotatsu Jo]], Major [[Satoru Onishi]] and Captain [[Haruji Hisamatsu]] were charged with the execution of the massacre. 

Kawamura and Oishi received the death penalty while the other five received [[life imprisonment|life sentences]] (Nishimura was later convicted for his role in the [[Parit Sulong massacre]] by an Australian military court and was sentenced to death). The court accepted the defence statement of "just following orders" by those put on trial. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. The death convicts were hanged on 26 June 1947. The British authorities allowed only six members of the victims' families to witness the executions of Kawamura and Oishi despite calls for the hangings to be made public {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.

When Singapore gained full self-government from British colonial government in 1959, waves of [[anti-Japanese sentiment]]s brewed within the Chinese community and they demanded reparations and an apology from Japan. The British colonial government had demanded only war reparations from Japan for damage caused to British property during the war before Singapore's independence. The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japanese Foreign Ministry]] denied Singapore's request for an apology and reparations in 1963, stating that the issue of war reparations with the British had already been settled in the [[San Francisco Treaty]] in 1951 and hence with Singapore as well, which was then still a British colony. 

Singapore's [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] responded by saying that the British colonial government did not represent the voice of Singaporeans. In September 1963, the Chinese community staged a boycott of Japanese goods but it lasted only seven days. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} With Singapore's full independence from [[Malaysia]] on 9 August 1965, the [[Government of Singapore]] made another request to Japan for reparations and an apology. On 25 October 1966, Japan agreed to pay $50 million in compensation, half of which as a grant and the other half as a loan. Japan did not make an official apology.

The remains of the victims of the Sook Ching Massacre have been unearthed by locals decades after the massacre. The most recent finding was in late 1997, when a man looking for [[earthworm]]s to use as fishing [[bait (luring substance)|bait]] found a skull, two gold teeth, an arm and a leg. The massacre sites of Sentosa, Changi and Punggol were marked as heritage sites by the [[National Monuments of Singapore]] in 1995 to commemorate the end of the Japanese Occupation.<ref>[http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/war/headline/slaugther.html SINGAPORE'S Slaughter beach<!-- Bot generated title --> (First published in The New Paper, Feb 10, 1998)]</ref>

==Historical Destiny of Singapore==
The massacre and its post-war judicial handling by the colonial British administration incensed the Chinese community. The Discovery Channel programme commented about its historic impact on local Chinese: "They felt the Japanese spilling of so much Chinese blood on Singapore soil has given them the moral claim to the island that hasn't existed before the war".  [[Lee Kuan Yew]] said on the Discovery Channel programme, "It was the catastrophic consequences of the war that changed the mindset, that my generation decided that, 'No...this doesn't make sense. We should be able to run this [island] as well as the British did, if not better.'"<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sej2FlPMZ3I&feature=related Discovery Channel programme - History Of Singapore <U+65B0><U+52A0><U+5761><U+7684><U+6B77><U+53F2> (II) Part 3]</ref> "The Asiatics had looked to them for leadership, and they had failed them." <ref>Lee Kuan Yew. The Singapore Story: Memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew. Singapore: Times, 1998</ref>

Germaine Foo-Tan writes in an article carried on the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) website:<ref>[http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/world_war2/v07n08_history.html.print.html?Status=1 1945 - The End of Japanese Occupation]</ref>

<blockquote>
While the speedy defeat of the British in Singapore was a shocking revelation to the local population, and the period of the Japanese Occupation arguably the darkest time for Singapore, these precipitated the development of political consciousness with an urgency not felt before. The British defeat and the fall of what was regarded as an invincible fortress rocked the faith of the local population in the ability of the British to protect them. Coupled with the secret and sudden evacuation of British soldiers, women and children from Penang, there was the uneasy realisation that the colonial masters could not be relied upon to defend the locals. The Japanese slogan "Asia for Asians" awoke many to be realities of colonial rule, that "however kind the masters were, the Asians were still second class in their own country"(5). Slowly, the local population became more aware of the need to have a bigger say in charting their destinies. The post-war years witnessed a political awakening and growing nationalistic feelings among the populace which in turn paved the way for the emergence of political parties and demands for self-rule in the 1950s and 1960s. 

The war and the Japanese Occupation will always remain etched in our memories that just as we must ourselves defend our homeland, only we can chart our own future.
