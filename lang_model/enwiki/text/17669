The '''Herreshoff Marine Museum''', located in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]], USA, is a maritime museum dedicated to the history of the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company, [[yachting]], and the [[America's Cup]].  The Herreshoff Manufacturing Company (1878-1945) was most notable for producing sailing yachts, including eight [[America's Cup]] defenders, and steam-powered vessels.

The museum, situated near [[Narragansett Bay]] on the grounds where the manufacturing company once stood, has a collection of over sixty boats including [[Nathanael Greene Herreshoff]]'s ''Clara'', built in 1887, [[Harold Vanderbilt]]'s ''Trivia'', and the 1992 IACC yacht, ''Defiant''.   The [[Nathanael Greene Herreshoff]] Model Room contains over 500 yacht and [[steam yacht]] models and the Rebecca Chase Herreshoff Library holds a collection of books and manuscripts related to the company, the Herreshoff family, and yachting.   The museum also hosts symposia related to yacht design and operates a sailing school.

==History==
The museum was founded in 1971 by A. Sidney DeWolf Herreshoff and Rebecca Chase Herreshoff to preserve the accomplishments of the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company.  In 1992, founded by [[Halsey Chase Herreshoff]] and [[Edward duMoulin]], the museum launched the [[America's Cup Hall of Fame]] to honor outstanding individuals of the America's Cup yacht race.

==Works==
Among other works, the company built [[Doris (Sailing yacht)]], which is listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=nris>{{NRISref|version=2009a}}</ref>
