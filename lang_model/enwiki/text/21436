The '''''American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine''''' is a biweekly [[peer-reviewed]] [[medical journal]] published in two yearly volumes by the [[American Thoracic Society]], commonly referred to as the "Blue journal".

It is one of three journals published by the American Thoracic Society, along with the ''[[American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology]]'' and the ''[[Annals of the American Thoracic Society]]''.

== Contents ==
The journal covers the [[pathophysiology]] and treatment of diseases that affect the [[respiratory system]]. The journal also publishes [[review article]]s in several forms. The "State of the Art" review is a treatise usually covering a broad field that brings bench research to the bedside. Shorter reviews are published as "Critical Care Perspectives" or "Pulmonary Perspectives." These are generally focused on a more limited area and advance a concerted opinion about care for a specific process. "Concise Clinical Reviews" provide an evidence-based synthesis of the literature pertaining to topics of fundamental importance to the practice of [[Pulmonology|pulmonary]], [[Intensive care medicine|critical care]], and sleep medicine. Images providing advances or unusual contributions to the field are published as "Images in Pulmonary, Critical Care, Sleep Medicine and the Sciences."

Recently the journal has included debates of a topical nature on issues of importance in pulmonary and critical care medicine and to the membership of the American Thoracic Society. Other recent changes have included incorporating works from the field of critical care medicine and the extension of the editorial governing body of journal policy to colleagues outside of the United States.

== History ==
The journal was established in March 1917 as the ''American Review of Tuberculosis''.<ref name=CASSI/> Since then there have been several title changes. In 1953 a subtitle was added, "''A Journal of Pulmonary Diseases''." In 1955 the title became the ''American Review of Tuberculosis and Pulmonary Diseases'', and in 1959 the ''American Review of Respiratory Diseases'' (the final "s" was dropped in 1966).<ref name=CASSI/> The journal obtained its current title in 1994.<ref name=CASSI/> 

The journal was established by the National Tuberculosis Association (which became the [[American Lung Association]] (ALA)) which published the journal from 1917 until 1994 when the medical section of the ALA, the American Thoracic Society became the publisher.<ref name=LC>{{cite web |url=http://lccn.loc.gov/94641388 |title= ''American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine'' |work=Library of Congress Catalog |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |format= |accessdate=2014-12-27}}</ref>
