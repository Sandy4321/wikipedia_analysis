The '''United States Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine''' (USARIEM) is the [[United States Army|U.S Army]]<U+2019>s main institution and facility for military [[environmental medicine]] and [[exercise physiology]] research. It is located at [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick, MA]] within the [[U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center]] (SSC) installation, but is a subordinate lab of the [[United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command|U. S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command]] (USAMRMC), headquartered at [[Fort Detrick]], MD, USA. 

==Mission==

USARIEM<U+2019>s ''Mission Statement'' mandates that the Institute:

{{Quotation|'''''Protect, Sustain and Enhance the Health and Performance of Warfighters through Basic and Applied Research in Environmental (Heat, Cold and Altitude) and Occupational Medicine.'''''|}}

Research programs focus on the ''servicemember'' (acclimation; body size; gender; race; age; health; hydration; nutrition; fitness; and sleep status), the ''environment'' (temperature; wind; humidity; and altitude), and the ''mission'' (work<U+2014>intensity, duration, and type; clothing and equipment; and medications).

==History==

USARIEM traces its institutional lineage back to 1927 and the [[Harvard Fatigue Laboratory]]. That facility fostered two institutions that ultimately merged. The first was the [[Climatic Research Laboratory]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence, MA]] (1943<U+2013>54), which relocated to Natick in 1954 under the new name of the [[Environmental Protection Research Division]] (EPRD) of the U.S. Army<U+2019>s [[Quartermaster Research and Engineering Command]]. The second was the [[Armored Medical Research Laboratory]] (AMRL) at [[Fort Knox]], KY (1942<U+2013>61) elements of which joined with the EPRD in 1961 to constitute the present USARIEM facility and organization.

==Products and capabilities==
USARIEM<U+2019>s basic and applied research capabilities are focused upon biomedical evaluations, health hazard assessments, countermeasures development and a rapid response to a diverse range of environmental threats and problems. Products include individual soldier equipment and rations; guidelines pertaining to training policy and [[preventive medicine]]; and performance monitoring strategies and predictive algorithms.

==Research Divisions==

Research divisions within USARIEM consist of '''Biophysics and Biomedical Modeling''' (develops biomedical models to simulate effects of heat, cold, high altitude, hydration, nutritional status and clothing systems and equipment), '''Military Performance''' (researches performance enhancements (physical, cognitive, behavioral, psychomotor) in military occupational tasks), '''Military Nutrition''' (researches nutritional issues, including new rations, affecting servicemembers), and '''Thermal and Mountain Medicine''' (researches physical and cognitive work capabilities and medical problems associated with high altitude military operations).

==Facilities==

USARIEM maintains several unique or highly specialized facilities:
