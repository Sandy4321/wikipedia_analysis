'''(Christian) Ludwig Schuncke''' (21 December 1810{{spaced ndash}}7 December 1834) was a German pianist and composer, and close friend of [[Robert Schumann]].  His early promise was eclipsed by his death from [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 23.

He was generally known as '''Ludwig''', and that name also appears as '''Louis''' in some references.  His surname appears as either '''Schuncke''' or '''Schunke'''.

==Biography==
Ludwig Schuncke was born in [[Kassel]] in 1810.  His father and first teacher Johann Gottfried Schuncke (1777<U+2013>1840), and his uncle Johann Michael Schuncke (1778-1821), were both professional horn players.<ref name=ruskin>[http://ruskincooper.com/wp-content/themes/starkers/docs/schuncke_article.doc RuskinCooper.com]</ref>

He demonstrated his talents very early, and they were encouraged.  In March 1822, aged only 11, he performed [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Hummel)|Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 85]], under the direction of [[Louis Spohr]]. He then went on a concert tour of Germany. [[Carl Maria von Weber]] expressed his approval of Schuncke<U+2019>s early compositions.<ref name=ruskin/>

In 1828, he was one of the four pianists who played [[Henri Bertini]]'s transcription of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Seventh Symphony]] for eight hands, the others being Bertini himself, [[Franz Liszt]] and Sowinsky.<ref>[http://www.lvbeethoven.com/Bio/BiographyContemporary_HenriBertini.html Beethoven's Contemporaries]</ref>

He went to [[Paris]] for study, where his main teachers were [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner]], [[Anton Reicha]] and [[Henri Herz]],<ref name=naxos>[http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.550715&catNum=550715&filetype=About%20this%20Recording&language=English Naxos]</ref> and where he also had friendships with people such as [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Sigismond Thalberg]] and [[Johann Peter Pixis]]. In Paris, he made his living by demonstrating Duport pianos, and he also lived in Duport's household.<ref name=ruskin/>  After completing his studies, he returned to Germany.  In [[Stuttgart]], he made the acquaintance of [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin]] after hearing him perform his [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Chopin)|Piano Concerto No. 1 in E minor]]. Schuncke dedicated his Capriccio in C minor, Op.10, to Chopin.<ref name=ruskin/> He then moved to [[Vienna]], [[Prague]] and [[Dresden]], appearing in concert,<ref>Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed. 1954, Vol VII, p. 640</ref> before finally settling in [[Leipzig]] in December 1833.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=MQdciNQVkXsC&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43&dq=Ludwig+Schunke&source=bl&ots=QURgekiCoo&sig=9g43EdeV5LxI3hONVDaVyFVaMUg&hl=en&ei=F1r5TKi9GIzorQerzeWuBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CC8Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&q=Ludwig%20Schunke&f=false Nancy B Reich, Clara Schumann: The Artist and the Woman]</ref> He lived in a boarding house and his room was next door to that of [[Robert Schumann]],<ref>[http://www.classicalarchives.com/work/492004.html#tvf=tracks&tv=about Classical Archives]</ref> whose very close friend he became. Schuncke was one of the co-founders of the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Musik]]'',<ref>[http://www.ripm.org/journal_info.php5?ABB=NZM RIPM]</ref> and one of its early contributors, under the pseudonym "Jonathan".<ref>[http://www.unomaha.edu/esc/2007Proceedings/Miller_Eusebius.pdf Marie C Miller, Eusebius and Florestan]</ref><ref name=change/> He was also a member of Schumann's ''Davidsbund''.<ref name=naxos/>

[[Image:Ludwig_Schunke_1834.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The only portrait of Ludwig Schuncke, done on his deathbed]] He appeared as soloist at the Leipzig [[Gewandhaus]] on 27 January 1834.<ref name=oster>[http://www.corno.de/webshop/Horn-Piano/rom048.html?XTCsid=d62927b5dba6a23549c05bcc944142ac Robert Ostermeyer Musikedition]</ref>  In one article, Schumann favourably compared the playing of the emerging Franz Liszt to that of Ludwig Schuncke.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=koSQAjlxeOIC&pg=PA163&lpg=PA163&dq=Ludwig+Schuncke&source=bl&ots=PETCfxkZJg&sig=BNiaMhWc_JNXFDX3ud33Xp0PVLU&hl=en&ei=gW75TKy0DcirrAfIq53CBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCYQ6AEwBTgy#v=onepage&q=Ludwig%20Schuncke&f=false Dana Andrew Gooley, The virtuoso Liszt]</ref>

Schuncke dedicated his ''Grande Sonate in G minor'', Op. 3, to Schumann, who greatly admired the work,<ref name=ruskin/> and in turn dedicated his [[Toccata (Schumann)|Toccata in C major]], Op.&nbsp;7, to Schuncke on its publication in 1834.   In a letter dated 4 September 1834, Schumann wrote that his whole wealth could be summed up in three names: [[Henriette Voigt]], [[Ernestine von Fricken]] and Ludwig Schuncke.<ref>[https://www.schubertiademusic.com/details/multiple_catalogs:yes/desc:Schumann,+Robert.+(1810+-+1856). Schubertiade Music]</ref>

Schumann's [[Carnaval (Schumann)|''Carnaval'']], Op. 9, had its origin in a set of variations on a ''Sehnsuchtswalzer'' by [[Franz Schubert]].  The catalyst for the variations may have been a work for piano and orchestra on the same theme by Schuncke (his Op. 14).  Schumann felt that Schuncke's heroic treatment was an inappropriate reflection of the tender nature of the Schubert piece, so he set out to approach his variations in a more intimate way, for piano solo.  He worked on the piece in 1833 and 1834.  The work was never completed, however, but he did re-use the opening 24 measures for the opening of ''Carnaval''.<ref>[http://www.andreasboyde.com/english/project_schumann_e.html Andreas Boyde]</ref>

Schuncke helped Schumann through his crisis of 1833-34, in which he had a serious depressive illness leading to a suicide attempt, and his brother and sister-in-law both died.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=s6XH8mOtfwcC&pg=PA812&lpg=PA812&dq=Ludwig+Schunke&source=bl&ots=Up0-y1ztjT&sig=GvKlrrdZrxk5z5HIbRxQjO5nkvI&hl=en&ei=9lr5TKzZCMPxrQewxtC7Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBgQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=Ludwig%20Schunke&f=false Don Michael Randel, Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music]</ref>  Schumann in turn nursed Schuncke through his own final illness.<ref name=naxos/>  Ludwig Schuncke died on 7 December 1834, two weeks before his 24th birthday, of [[tuberculosis]].  He is buried on the old Johannesfriedhof in Leipzig.<ref name=oster/>  Schumann forever after kept Schuncke's death bed portrait in his own study, in a gallery of pictures hung above his piano.<ref name=change>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=hYBAFG01FOsC&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=Ludwig+Schunke&source=bl&ots=smsCOnXJEt&sig=j_ketWdA-_EDJ83TJqhg9CUpYRw&hl=en&ei=umT5TNzBLo3QrQf3w7i8Bw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CC4Q6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&q=Ludwig%20Schunke&f=false Alessandra Comini, The Changing Image of Beethoven]</ref>

==Schuncke's music==
Although their approaches sometimes differed, Schuncke and Schumann influenced each other to a significant degree.  This can be seen in the following example, where an excerpt from Schuncke's ''Grande Sonate'' in G minor could easily be played alongside an except from Schumann's [[Piano Concerto (Schumann)|Piano Concerto in A minor]].

==Recorded legacy==
[[Jozef De Beenhouwer]] was the first to perform Schuncke's ''Grande Sonate in G minor'', Op. 3, which has also been recorded by [[Mario Patuzzi]] and [[Gregor Weichert]].  (His name is shown on Patuzzi's and Weichert's albums as "Christian L. Schunke"<ref>[http://www.classicalarchives.com/album/8007144620271.html Classical Archives]</ref> and "Louis Schuncke"<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=schuncke-works-for-piano-w15303|pure_url=yes}} AllMusic]</ref> respectively.)

His song ''Gretchen am Spinnrad'' is also recorded.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=schumann-sammlung-von-musik-stcken-alter-und-neuer-zeit-w258384|pure_url=yes}} AllMusic]</ref>
