[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson''' ('''Frank''') '''Bladin''', [[Companion of the Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&nbsp;August 1898 <U+2013> 2&nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1920. Bladin transferred from the [[Australian Army|Army]] to the Air Force in 1923, and learned to fly at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Point Cook]], Victoria. He held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed "Dad" in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.<ref name="Stephens pp. 145-146">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 145&ndash;146</ref>

Ranked [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] at the outbreak of World War&nbsp;II, by September 1941 Bladin had been raised to temporary [[air commodore]]. He became [[Air Officer Commanding]] North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942<U+2013>43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory. Personally leading [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, he earned the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to [[No.&nbsp;38 Group RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[mentioned in despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Promoted acting [[air vice marshal]] in 1946, Bladin was among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF. His roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], Sub-Lieutenant [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 192</ref> During 1925&ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 Flying Training School]], Point Cook.<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 234</ref> Having been promoted to [[flight lieutenant]], he married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]], New South Wales, on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.<ref name="SMH"/><ref>Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p. 97</ref> 

Bladin was posted to Britain in 1929 to attend [[RAF Staff College, Andover]], and wrote an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly'', one of the few published pieces of work on air power produced by RAAF officers in the pre-war years.<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 445</ref> Promoted to [[squadron leader]], he took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.<ref name="Units">RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 2&ndash;5</ref> Bladin found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, "had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangars and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous". He proceeded to change this, deploying the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]], where he "borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice" over a two-week period commencing in late November 1935.<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 190&ndash;191</ref> After completing his tenure with No.&nbsp;1 Squadron in December,<ref name="Units"/> Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&nbsp;1 Flying Training School.

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of World War&nbsp;II was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted to [[group captain]] in June, he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[air commodore]] the following month.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="High Fliers"/> By 1&nbsp;January 1942, Bladin was serving as Assistant Chief of the Air Staff (Operations), charged with readying air bases and putting into effect plans for the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]].<ref name="Gillison p. 298">Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 298]</ref><ref name="RAAF in SWPA">Stephens, ''The RAAF in the Southwest Pacific Area'', pp. 29&ndash;31</ref>  He took over as Air Officer Commanding North-Western Area (AOC NWA) on 25&nbsp;March that year.<ref name="Gillison pp. 554-559">Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 554&ndash;559]</ref> Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].<ref name="Stephens pp. 145-146"/> He also had to restore morale following the [[bombing of Darwin]] on 19&nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.<ref name="Stephens pp. 145-146"/><ref name="Gillison pp. 554-559"/> Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields so that he could disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, "the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war", and earned distinction as the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.<ref name="Stephens pp. 145-146"/> The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortresses]] on [[Sulawesi|Celebes]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied bombers managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese fighters during their return to base.<ref name="ADB"/> Bladin's award was recommended in September, and promulgated in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&nbsp;November 1944.<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

By December 1942, Bladin's strength in NWA consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] light bombers, and [[Vultee A-31 Vengeance|A-31 Vengeance]] dive bombers. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchell]] medium bombers and USAAF [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberator]] heavy bombers.<ref name="Gillison pp. 649-651">Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 649&ndash;651]</ref> As Japanese air raids continued into 1943, Bladin placed his bombers inland, and his fighters close to the coast where they could intercept the raiders.<ref>Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/03.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 43]</ref> Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&nbsp;January 1943,<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=on 24 April 2009}}</ref> he stepped up offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.<ref name="Stephens pp. 145-146"/> He often employed his own judgement in the selection of targets, as detailed directives from superior headquarters were not always forthcoming.<ref name="RAAF in SWPA"/> On 27&nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]], which destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].<ref name="Gillison pp. 649-651"/> A [[Raid on Darwin (2 May 1943)|major engagement over Darwin]] on 2&nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires crashing and several others making forced landings, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqu<U+00E9> concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' "heavy losses" and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the "alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots". He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based; four enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground.<ref name="Odgers pp. 46-50">Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/03.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 46&ndash;50]</ref> 

On 17&nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.<ref name="Odgers pp. 59-60">Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 59&ndash;60]</ref> The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.<ref name="Odgers p. 61">Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 61]</ref> When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was "well organised, keen and in good shape".<ref name="Odgers p. 104">Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 104]</ref> Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of [[No. 38 Group RAF|No.&nbsp;38 Group RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the Allied invasion of France.<ref name="Herington pp. 14-15">Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp. 14&ndash;15]</ref> He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]], and was [[mentioned in despatches]] two days later.<ref name="High Fliers"/><ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=on 24 April 2009}}</ref> Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|Second Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]] in October 1944.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="High Fliers"/> On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC [[RAAF Command]], the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with directives from the Air Board, the RAAF's controlling body, but in the end the Australian government made no change to command arrangements.<ref>Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp. 154&ndash;159</ref>

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947.|alt=Man in dark military uniform with peaked cap inspecting troops at a parade]]
The RAF had planned to deploy an airborne formation, No.&nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre and requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command, but this was cancelled with the end of hostilities in August 1945. His next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]], Japan, in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to Lieutenant General [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin not only for his operational command and staff experience in the RAAF and the RAF during World War&nbsp;II, but for his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having a background that was confined to the Air Force alone.<ref name="Stephens pp. 212-213">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 212&ndash;213</ref> Promoted acting [[air vice marshal]] on 1&nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="Stephens pp. 212-213"/>  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later Air Chief Marshal Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 5</ref> In June 1947, he was appointed Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].<ref name="Going Solo">Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 69&ndash;70</ref> His acting rank of air vice marshal was made substantive on 1&nbsp;October 1948.<ref name="ADB"/><ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 24&ndash;25</ref> As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at [[RAAF Bradfield Park|Bradfield Park]] on Sydney's [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]], namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Subsequently known as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered "complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack".<ref name="Going Solo"/>

Bladin became Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24&nbsp;November 1948; this position gave him a seat on the Air Board, which consisted of the RAAF's most senior officers and was chaired by the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]. He succeeded Joe Hewitt, and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 76, 118, 500</ref><ref>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 185</ref> RAAF Staff College was opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, providing an advanced defence course aimed at squadron leaders and wing commanders; various international facilities were also utilised to further officers' education.<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 142&ndash;144</ref> In October, Bladin became involved in the push for a Junior Equipment and Administrative Training Scheme to offer apprenticeships to clerical and supply staff, which was established two years later.<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''From the Ground Up'', pp. 91&ndash;95</ref> He was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=on 24 April 2009}}</ref> In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, he sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 120</ref> Over the following year, in response to increased demands for aircrew to meet Australia's commitments to the [[Malayan Emergency]] and the [[Korean War]], pilot training was broken out from a single all-encompassing course at No.&nbsp;1 Flying Training School (No.&nbsp;1 FTS) in Point Cook, Victoria, into separate courses at the newly formed [[No. 1 Initial Flying Training School RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 Initial Flying Training School]] at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], Queensland, [[No. 1 Basic Flying Training School RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School]] at [[Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School (re-formed from No.&nbsp;1 FTS) at Point Cook.<ref>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 199</ref>

In the early 1960s he helped raise funds for building the [[Anzac]] Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier.
