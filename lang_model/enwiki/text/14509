'''''The CIA and September 11''''' ([[German language|German]]: '''''Die CIA und der 11. September''''') is a controversial 2003 book by  [[Andreas von B<U+00FC>low]], a former state-secretary in the [[Germany|German]] [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Defence]] and an [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] member of the [[German parliament]] from 1969 to 1994. The book has enjoyed considerable commercial success in Germany, where it is published by [[Piper Verlag]], and has sold over 100,000 copies. However, it has faced allegations ranging from absurdity and fostering [[anti-Americanism]], to [[anti-Semitism]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}, while the quality of its [[Journalism sourcing|sourcing]] and the timing of its publication have given rise to debate within the German publishing industry.

The book's core hypotheses lack any basis{{Fact|date=February 2007}} in peer-reviewed research and are not supported by the majority of the German public.

The book suggests that the 9/11 attacks were self-inflicted: a [[covert operation]] aimed at influencing domestic opinion and to persuade Americans to support the [[2001 war in Afghanistan|invasions of Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|of Iraq]]. It is written in a speculative style, laden with terms such as "could", "might", "maybe" and "if",<ref name = Telegraph> [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/11/20/wbulo20.xml&sSheet=/news/2003/11/20/ixworld.html "German Sept 11 theory stokes anti-US feeling"], [[Kate Connolly]], [[November 20]] [[2003]], ''[[telegraph.co.uk]]'' (URL accessed [[6 April]], [[2006]])</ref> and does not directly accuse the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] of direct responsibility for the attacks.<ref name=FAZ>"September 11 conspiracy claims find large readership", [[Michael Gavin]], [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], [[September 5]], [[2003]]</ref> It does, however, attempt to demolish the "conventional" account of the 9/11 attacks, and while it does not build up a substantive account to replace it, it leaves insinuations and rumours to suggest possibilities. For instance, while it is argued that such well-organized attacks could only occur with "the support of the intelligence agencies", the exact details of that support are left unspecified. The book suggests that no plane crashed into the [[Pentagon]] and none in [[Pennsylvania]] on 9/11, and that the alleged mobile phone calls on flight 93 were not real. <ref name = Telegraph />

It states that the theory of [[Organizers of the September 11, 2001 attacks|the Arab hijackers]] was created by the CIA, and that these Arabs may not even have been aware that the planes were going to crash. Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the possibility that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites observations in support of the theory that the [[collapse of the World Trade Center]] might have been due to explosives. Von B<U+00FC>low does not believe that [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[al-Qaeda]] are responsible for the 9/11 attacks. <ref name = FAZ />

The book argues that the [[Israel]]i [[intelligence service]], [[Mossad]], may have been somehow involved and may have warned Israelis to avoid the [[World Trade Center|Twin Towers]] in the days preceding 9/11. This suspicion is supported by the claim that only one Israeli died in the attacks.<ref name=Spiegel> [http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/spiegel/0,1518,265160-4,00.html "Panoply of the Absurd"], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', [[September 8]], [[2003]], English translation by Christopher Sultan (URL accessed [[6 April]], [[2006]])</ref>

==Publication==
The book caused a storm at the 2003 [[Frankfurt Book Fair]], together with a number of other German books on the "real story" behind the 9/11 attacks, following the success of [[Thierry Meyssan]]'s ''[[9/11: The Big Lie]]'' in [[France]]. Other best-selling books included [[Mathias Br<U+00F6>ckers]]'s ''Conspiracies, Conspiracy Theories and the Secrets of September 11th'' and [[Gerhard Wisnewski]]'s ''Operation 9/11'' (ISBN 3-426-77671-5), but ''The CIA and September 11'' became the best known.

The 271 page book has had a vast [[print run]] in Germany, with more than 100,000 copies being sold,<ref name = Telegraph /> and became a number three best-seller on the ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' [[non-fiction]] chart.<ref> [http://www.germany.info/relaunch/info/publications/week/2003/030912/misc1.html  "Bestsellers <U+2014> a look at what Germany is reading"], the week of [[September 12]], [[2003]], published by the [[German Embassy in Washington, D.C.]], and [http://www.germany.info/relaunch/info/publications/week/2003/030926/misc2.html the same] for the week of [[September 26]], [[2003]]. By the week of [[October 10]], [[2003]] the book had [http://www.germany.info/relaunch/info/publications/week/2003/031010/misc3.html dropped out of the top 10.] (URLs accessed [[6 April]], [[2006]])</ref>

Reprinted in ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[September 22]], [[2003]], as "9/11? It Never Happened"
</ref>

Piper Verlag is considered a reputable publisher.<ref name=Theil /> The editor of Piper Verlag, [[Klaus Stadler]], contended in an interview with ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'' that: {{cquote|We told ourselves that we would take it seriously, but we do not feel obligated to independently check each and every detail ... And my own personal position is that Mr. von B<U+00FC>low poses a number of very interesting and important questions. The answers to these questions should be weighed by responsible readers, who should take time to consider them. We don't want to patronize people.}}

The release coincided with widespread skepticism among the German public about the honesty and motivation of the [[George W. Bush administration]], to the extent that a [[Forsa]] survey published in ''[[Die Zeit]]'' in July 2003 found that nineteen percent of Germans (rising to thirty one percent among under 30s) believed that elements within the United States government were behind the 9/11 attacks.<ref>''[[Die Zeit]]'', [[July 23]], [[2003]] (in [[German language|German]]). The results of the poll are repeated in the English-language ''Telegraph'', ''Deutche Welle'' and ''Newsweek'' references.</ref> This provided fertile ground for ''The CIA and September 11'', which sold strongly: von B<U+00FC>low eclipsed the sales of writers who clung to a "conventional" interpretation of the 9/11 attacks, such as the intelligence expert [[Oliver Schrom]].<ref name = Theil />

==Response==
The work has been described as supporting or fostering [[anti-Americanism]].<ref name=Telegraph /><ref name=Theil /> However, in an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', von B<U+00FC>low denied that his book was contributing to anti-American sentiment in Germany:
{{cquote|I'm not in the least anti-American ... I'm just part of a growing momentum against Bush and his chess power-politics. I feel sorry for those who are being sucked in by his ideas.<ref name =Telegraph />}}

The book has also been attacked for the quality of its journalism and research.<ref name=DW /> The author admitted that much of the material came from the [[Internet]]. ''The CIA and September 11'' was one of the subjects of a cover story in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in September 2003, along with Gerhard Wisnewski's tv documentary ''Aktenzeichen 11.9. ungel<U+00F6>st'' and the books ''Conspiracies, Conspiracy Theories and the Secrets of September 11th'' (Br<U+00F6>ckers) and ''Operation 9/11'' (Wisnewski).<ref name=Spiegel /> The article, entitled "Panoply of the Absurd", sharply criticizes von B<U+00FC>low's reliance on Internet research. 

An example of this is the claim that at least six of the suspected hijackers named in the aftermath of the attacks turned up alive. ''Der Spiegel'' offers an explanation for this apparent mystery: [[BBC News]] used as a source the ''[[Arab News]]'', an English-language [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] newspaper, which in turn had compiled reports from Arabic newspapers, of people who obviously had nothing to do with the attacks but happened to share the same names with some of the suspected hijackers. No photographs of the suspected hijackers had been released at this point in time, and thus a few cases of mistaken identity occurred. In one instance, a man with the name of [[Saeed al-Ghamdi|Said al-Ghamdi]] had given an interview to ''[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]'' newspaper in [[Tunis]], outraged that he had been portrayed by [[CNN]] as one of the hijackers. CNN had broadcast his photograph after doing research on their own and finding a Saudi "Said al-Ghamdi" who had received flight training in the United States. CNN had found the wrong suspect, which only became clear once the [[FBI]] officially released the photographs of the suspected hijackers. 

The article in ''Der Spiegel'' accuses von B<U+00FC>low of accepting without due scrutiny any fragment that fits his suspicions of foul play, and describes him as a "dreamer". It also attacks von B<U+00FC>low for his acceptance of what is often described as [[urban legend]]s surrounding the attacks. One of the claims in the book is that only one Israeli citizen died in the WTC attack (this was reported in the New York Times on [[September 22]] [[2001]], but the Israeli [[Consulate]] later asserted that seven Israelis were among the dead in the WTC - it is unclear how many of those were cases of dual citizenship). 

A report by the [[American Jewish Committee]] accused the book, along with other so-called 9/11 conspiracy literature of 2003, of perpetuating myths and stereotyping Jews as criminal and conspiratorial.<ref> [http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/wistrich.pdf "European Anti-Semitism Reinvents Itself"], [[Robert S. Wistrich]], [[American Jewish Committee]], 2005 (URL accessed [[6 April]], [[2005]])</ref> The [[Anti-Defamation League]] has found evidence of B<U+00FC>low being cited by anti-Semitic publications and websites keen to link Mossad to the 9/11 attacks. <ref name = ADL> [http://www.adl.org/anti_semitism/9-11conspiracytheories.pdf "Unraveling Anti-Semitic 9/11 Conspiracy Theories"], [[Anti-Defamation League]], published by [[Gorowitz Institute]], 2003 (URL accessed [[6 April]], [[2006]])</ref>

In a prominently placed tv interview [http://www.daserste.de/maischberger/sendung_dyn~uid,n32rikt9zmixyy2s2upzauys~cm.asp ("Menschen bei Maischberger" - ARD, 9.9.2003)], Andreas von B<U+00FC>low said it was a "Medienmasche" (media scam) to accuse him of anti-Semitism. He denied that he ever said or believed anything about "Jews" being warned of the attacks (one of the urban legends). He said such claims were nonsense. He confirmed, however, that in his opinion a number of indications exist which point to some sort of connection between the Israeli Mossad and the act and perpetrators of 9/11.<ref name = Arbeiterfotografie> [http://www.arbeiterfotografie.com/galerie/kein-krieg/hintergrund/index-rezension-0010.html "Interview transcript, in German"], published by "Arbeiterfotografie" (German journal), 2003. Quote von B<U+00FC>low: "Es geht eigentlich darum, ob ein Mossad-Element in dieser ganzen Geschichte da ist. Der Mossad mu<U+00DF> hervorragend informiert gewesen sein." (What this controversy is all about is whether the Mossad is part of the story. The Mossad had to have had excellent information).</ref>
