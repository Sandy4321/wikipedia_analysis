The "Bus Uncle" title for the video was coined by members of an Internet forum in reference to the older man in the video. In Hong Kong, it is common to [[fictive kinship|refer to an older man as "Uncle"]] (<U+963F><U+53D4>), hence the English translation "The Bus Uncle". The name is also a reference to [[Football (soccer)|football]] commentator [[Lam Sheung Yee]] (<U+6797><U+5C1A><U+7FA9>), who is nicknamed "Uncle" and whose voice resembles that of the older man.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Lam's name appears as part of the title of the original video.<ref name="original-youtube"/> Contrary to reports in Western media,<ref name="WP">{{cite news

In June 2006, TVB television made a parody of the Bus Uncle video in promoting its coverage of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], featuring its sports commentator Lam Sheung Yee (<U+6797><U+5C1A><U+7FA9>), whose voice resembles Chan's, on a bus playing the role of the Bus Uncle. In the advertisement, a passenger sitting behind Lam Sheung Yee (played by Lam Man Chung) questions whether Lam Sheung Yee feels pressured for his responsibilities in the upcoming World Cup, which would be his last TV appearance before retirement. Turning around, Lam replies that there is no pressure and emphasises the issue (i.e. the viewers' demand for World Cup coverage) has been resolved.

In addition, [[sitcom]]s of [[Asia Television Limited|ATV]] and TVB imitated the video in argument scenes. In episode 67 of the TVB sitcom ''[[Welcome to the House]] (<U+9AD8><U+670B><U+6EFF><U+5EA7>)'', the young bespectacled main character tried to stop a man from talking too loudly on the [[mobile phone]] in the cinema. As a result, he was harshly rebuked by the man. Once his family knew about the incident from a video uploaded on the [[Internet]], they taught the character to be more assertive and not to allow himself to be bullied.

Journalism professor and Internet expert Anthony Fung Ying-him also attributed the popularity of the low-resolution video of a "trivial event" to the emotional climate of the city.<ref name="explode" /> While other viral videos are favoured by specific [[demographics]], this one spread widely due to its universal<ref name="alongfor" /> expression of "the true feelings of ordinary people."<ref name="CNNrp" />

On the other hand, Ho Kwok Leung, an applied social science lecturer at the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]], held that attention surrounding the video reflected the boring lives of [[Hong Kong people]]. With few interesting topics to discuss, they savour the pleasure of spreading information to a vast audience and the creation of [[Internet meme]]s. Furthermore, the banning of the use of some video catchphrases in certain schools made the incident more appealing. This lifestyle, according to Leung, is fertile ground for the cultivation of a "video clip culture".<ref>{{cite news

===Civic awareness concerns===
[[Image:Bus No Phone.jpg|thumb|right|Bus passengers are advised to lower their voices while talking on their mobile phones in Hong Kong.|alt=cartoon with comic-legend saying 'speak softly']]
Ah Nong (<U+963F><U+6FC3>), a popular [[writer|literary figure]] and [[artist]] in Hong Kong, believed that the incident highlighted the [[apathy]] of the common Hong Kong people. He emphasised that during the heated exchange between Chan and Ho, not a single [[bystander]] came to Ho's aid. He recalled an incident a few years back where he confronted a man smoking on the lower deck of a bus and was scolded for the rest of the journey. He said it was useless to complain to the bus driver who would not bother to waste his time, let alone the other passengers. Ah Nong argued that in such a society, a person can be accused of wrongdoing despite good intentions.<ref>{{cite news

There was support for Ho's desire for a lower volume as well as sympathy for the stress felt by the "Bus Uncle."<ref name="Person of the Year" /> Others maintained that Chan's actions were atypical of etiquette in Hong Kong.<ref name="WSJ" /> Apple Tse Ho Yi, minister of the Hong Kong Christian Service, carried out a survey of 506 students over the age of 12 following the incident. Of the respondents who claim they regularly encountered people speaking loudly on the phone on buses, only 47 percent said they would intervene by talking to the phone user or alerting the driver. Reasons for inaction include fear, apathy and inability to solve the problem. On civic awareness, the majority of the respondents did not consider chatting loudly on the phone to be wrong. Tse concluded that the current generation of Hong Kong young people have poor civic awareness, and it is natural that disputes often occur due to inconsideration.<ref name="survey">{{cite news

She attributed this phenomenon to the television screens found in many vehicles and trains, which broadcast programmes at high volumes. She suggested that the government should provide better civic education for the public to make them more considerate of others. When it comes to schools which banned the usage of catch phrases like "I'm stressed!" Ng stated that teachers must be able to distinguish whether the students really face pressure or are simply following the trend, and provide guidance if necessary.<ref name = "Problem"/>

===Criticism of media ethics===
[[Image:HK Newspapers.jpg|thumb|Hong Kong newspapers have been criticised for their sensationalist techniques.|alt=3 newspapers on a desk top]]
Some denied that any social insight could be gleaned from the video clip, arguing that the frenzy was artificially created by sensationalist newspapers in order to boost circulation and profits. Clement So York-kee, Director of the [[Journalism school|School of Journalism]] at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], warned that methods to uncover the incident between Chan and Ho "did not seem to ... [involve the] traditional practice of news reporting."<ref name=alongfor>{{cite news

In late May 2006, a group of journalists and photographers initiated and followed Chan's second meeting with Ho. After Ho's refusal, they brought Bus Uncle to a dinner and karaoke session.<ref name="MM" /> Although the session was widely reported, many believed it was artificially created news and unworthy of front-page attention.<ref>{{cite news

''Ta Kung Pao'' stated that the Bus Uncle incident tested the professionalism of the Hong Kong mass media, its editorial noting that Chan sought remuneration for interviews and made many extraordinary claims about himself which were published without verification. The editorial concluded by advising journalists not to fabricate news, but instead to emphasise the verifiability of stories and consider carefully whether an incident is newsworthy.<ref>{{cite news

Others held that the frenzy was not the product of a media conspiracy, but rather a reflection of the public's curiosity and Hong Kong's competitive consumer-driven media market.<ref name=alongfor/> The situation also allowed camera phone marketers to highlight the potential comedic value and draw attention away from privacy concerns.<ref name="MM">{{cite news
