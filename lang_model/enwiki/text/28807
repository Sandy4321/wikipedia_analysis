'''William IV''' (William Henry) ([[21 August]] [[1765]] &ndash; [[20 June]] [[1837]]) was King of the [[United Kingdom]] and of [[Hanover (state)|Hanover]] from [[26 June]] [[1830]] until his death. William, the third son of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and younger brother and successor of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]], was the penultimate monarch of the [[House of Hanover]]. During his youth, he served in the [[Royal Navy]]; he was afterwards nicknamed the Sailor King. His reign was one of several reforms: the [[poor law]] updated, municipal government democratised, child labour restricted and slavery abolished throughout the [[British Empire]]. The most important reform legislation of William IV's reign was the [[Reform Act 1832]], which refashioned the British electoral system. William did not meddle in politics as much as either his brother or his father, though he did prove to be the last monarch to appoint a Prime Minister contrary to the will of Parliament (in 1834). 

==Early life==
William was born on [[21 August]] [[1765]] at [[Buckingham Palace|Buckingham House]], the son of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]]. He had two elder brothers ([[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince George, Prince of Wales]] and [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York]]), and was not expected to inherit the Crown. He was baptized in the Great Council Chamber of [[St James's Palace]] on [[18 September]] [[1765]] and his godparents were the [[Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh|Duke of Gloucester]], [[Prince Henry Frederick, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn|Prince Henry]] and [[Princess Augusta Charlotte of Wales|Princess Augusta Charlotte]].

At the age of thirteen, he joined the [[Royal Navy]] as a midshipman, and was present at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]] in 1780. He served in [[New York]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]]. While the prince was there, [[George Washington]] approved a plot to kidnap the prince, writing "The spirit of enterprise so conspicuous in your plan for surprising in their quarters and bringing off the Prince William Henry and Admiral Digby merits applause, and you have my authority to make the attempt in any manner, and at such a time, as your judgment may direct.  I am fully persuaded, that it is unnecessary to caution you against offering insult or indignity to the person of the Prince...."  The plot did not come to fruition; the British heard of it and doubled the prince's guard.

William became a [[Lieutenant]] in 1785 and a [[Captain]] the following year. In 1786, he was stationed in the [[West Indies]].  [[Horatio Nelson]] wrote of William, "In his professional line, he is superior to two-thirds, I am sure, of the [Naval] list; and in attention to orders, and respect to his superior officer, I hardly know his equal."

William sought to be made a [[Duke]] like his elder brothers, and to receive a similar Parliamentary grant; but his father was reluctant.  To put pressure on him, William threatened to run for the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] for the constituency of [[Totnes]] in [[Devon]].  Defeated, George III created him [[Duke of Clarence|Duke of Clarence and St Andrews and Earl of Munster]] on May 16, 1789, supposedly saying, "I well know it is one more vote added to the opposition."

==Duke of Clarence==
The newly created Duke ceased his active service in the Royal Navy in 1790. He was promoted to [[Admiral|Rear-Admiral]] upon retirement. When the [[United Kingdom]] declared war on [[France]] in 1793, he was anxious to serve his country, but was not put in command of a ship. Instead, he spent time in the [[House of Lords]], where he defended the exorbitant spending of his brother, the Prince of Wales, who had applied to Parliament for a grant for relief of his debts. He also spoke in favour of slavery (which, although it had virtually died out in the United Kingdom, still existed in the British colonies); he used his experience in the West Indies to defend his positions.

After he left the Royal Navy, the Duke of Clarence had a long affair with an Irish actress, [[Dorothy Jordan|Dorothea Bland]], better known by her stage name, Mrs Jordan. From 1791, the couple had ten illegitimate children, who were given the surname "FitzClarence." The affair would last for twenty years before ending in 1811. In that same year, Clarence was appointed [[Admiral of the Fleet]]. When [[Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales|Princess Charlotte]], his niece by the Prince Regent died in childbirth in 1817, the King was left with twelve children--and no legitimate grandchildren.  The race was on among the Royal Dukes to marry and produce an heir.  On [[13 July]] [[1818]], he married [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Princess Adelaide]], daughter of the [[Saxe-Meiningen|Duke of Saxe-Meiningen]], a woman half his age. Though he had been able to father at least ten illegitimate children by Mrs Jordan, Clarence had only two short-lived children by his wife: [[Princess Charlotte of Clarence|Charlotte Augusta Louisa]] (who died on [[21 March]] [[1819]], the day of her birth{{fn|1}}) and [[Princess Elizabeth of Clarence|Elizabeth Georgina Adelaide]] ([[20 December]] [[1820]] - [[4 March]] [[1821]]). The couple also had stillborn twin sons, on [[23 April]] [[1822]].

Clarence's elder brother, the Prince of Wales, had been [[Prince Regent]] since 1811 because of the mental illness of their father, King George III. In 1820, the king died, leaving the Crown to the Prince Regent, who became King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. As the new King was estranged from his wife and had no surviving legitimate children, the Duke of Clarence was second in the line of succession to the Throne, preceded by his brother, Frederick, Duke of York. When the Duke of York died in 1827, Clarence, then more than sixty years old, became heir presumptive. Later that year, George IV appointed Clarence to the office of [[Lord High Admiral]], which had been in commission (that is, exercised by a board rather than by a single individual) since 1709. While in office, Clarence attempted to take independent control of naval affairs, although the law required him to act, under most circumstances, on the advice of at least two members of his Council. The King, through the Prime Minister, requested his resignation in 1828; the Duke of Clarence complied.

Despite the difficulties which the Duke experienced, he did considerable good as Lord High Admiral, abolishing the [[cat o' nine tails]] for most offences other than [[mutiny]] and requiring regular reports of the condition and preparedness of each ship.  He commissioned the first steam warship and advocated for more.  William's biographer, Phillip Ziegler, points out that holding the office permitted William to make mistakes and learn from them--a process that might have been far more costly had he done so as King.

==The Reform Crisis==
[[Image:William iv england.JPG|left|frame|William IV]]
{{House of Hanover|william4}}
When George IV died in 1830 without surviving legitimate issue, the Duke of Clarence ascended the Throne, aged 64, as William IV - the oldest man ever to assume the throne. Unlike his extravagant brother, William was unassuming, discouraging pomp and ceremony. In contrast to George IV, who tended to spend most of his time in [[Windsor Castle]], William was known, especially early in his reign, to walk, unaccompanied, through London or Brighton.  Until the Reform Crisis eroded his standing, he was very popular among the people.

At the beginning of William IV's reign, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] was Prime Minister. During the general election of 1830 (the death of the monarch then required fresh elections), however, Wellington's [[Tory|Tories]] lost to the [[British Whig Party|Whig Party]] under [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey]]. When he became Prime Minister, Lord Grey immediately announced that he would attempt to reform an electoral system that had seen few changes since the fifteenth century. The inconsistencies in the system were great; for example, large towns such as [[Manchester]] and [[Birmingham]] elected no members, whilst minuscule boroughs such as [[Old Sarum (UK Parliament constituency)|Old Sarum]] (with seven voters) elected two members of Parliament each. Often, the small boroughs&mdash;also known as [[rotten borough]]s and [[pocket borough]]s&mdash;were "owned" by great aristocrats, whose "nominees" would invariably be elected by the constituents.

As monarch, William IV played an important role in the Reform Crisis. When the House of Commons defeated the First Reform Bill in 1831, Lord Grey's ministry urged an immediate dissolution of Parliament and a new general election. At first, William hesitated to exercise the power to dissolve Parliament, elections having just been held the year before. He was, however, irritated by the conduct of the Opposition, which formally requested the passage of an Address, or resolution, in the House of Lords, against dissolution. Regarding the Opposition's motion as an attack on his power, William IV went in person to the House of Lords, where debate on the Address was raging, and [[prorogation|prorogued]] Parliament. Had he sent [[Lords Commissioners|commissioners]] on his behalf, as was (and still is) normally done, they would have had to await the end of the debate, whereas the arrival of the monarch ended all debate.  This forced new elections for the House of Commons, which yielded a great victory for the reformers. But although the House of Commons was clearly in favour of parliamentary reform, the [[House of Lords]] remained implacably opposed to it. After the rejection of the Second Reform Bill (1831) by the Upper House, people across the country began to agitate for reform; some grew violent, participating in several "Reform Riots". The nation saw a political crisis greater than any since the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688.

In the face of popular excitement, the Grey ministry refused to accept defeat in the House of Lords, and re-introduced the Bill. It passed easily in the House of Commons, but was once again faced with difficulties in the House of Lords. Bowing to popular pressure, the Lords did not reject the bill outright, but were prepared to change its basic character through amendments. Frustrated by the Lords' recalcitrance, Grey suggested that the King "swamp" the House of Lords by creating a sufficient number of new peers to ensure the passage of the Reform Bill. 

When William IV refused, citing the difficulties with a permanent expansion of the Peerage, Grey and his fellow ministers resigned. The King attempted to restore the Duke of Wellington to office, but first heard of an official resolution of the House of Commons requesting Grey's return. On the Duke of Wellington's advice, the King agreed to reappoint Grey's ministry. The King also agreed to create new peers if the House of Lords continued to pose difficulties, but did not have to resort to such an extraordinary course of action when the bill's opponents agreed to abstain. Consequently, Parliament passed the bill, which became the Reform Act 1832. Parliament proceeded to other reforms, including the abolition of slavery throughout the British Empire and the restriction of child labour, but William IV had little to do with their passage.

==Later life==
[[image:william4coin.jpg|frame|left|Half-Crown of William IV, 1836. The inscription reads GULIELMUS IIII D(ei) G(ratia) BRITANNIAR REX F(idei) D(efensor) (William IV by the Grace of God King of the Britons, Defender of the Faith)]]
For the remainder of his reign, William interfered actively in politics only once, in 1834; when he became the last Sovereign to choose a Prime Minister contrary to the will of Parliament. Two years after the passage of the Reform Act of 1832, the ministry had become unpopular and also lost the King's support due to its support for the reform of the [[Church of Ireland]]. In 1834, Lord Grey resigned; one of the Whigs in his cabinet, [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne]], replaced him. The Melbourne administration, for the most part, included the same members as the Grey administration; though disliked by many in the country, it retained an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons. Some members of the Government, however, were obnoxious to the King.

In October 1834, the [[Leader of the House of Commons]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[John Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer|John Charles Spencer, Viscount Althorp]], inherited a peerage, thus removing him from the House of Commons to the Lords. Because of this, he was forced to relinquish his posts&mdash;traditionally, a member of the House of Lords could hold neither post. All agreed that this required a partial reconstruction of the Cabinet, but William IV claimed that the ministry had been weakened beyond repair. He used the removal of Lord Althorp&mdash;not from the Government, but from one House to the other&mdash;as the pretext for the dismissal of the entire ministry.

With Lord Melbourne gone, William IV chose to entrust power to a Tory, [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]]. Since Peel was then in Italy, the Duke of Wellington was provisionally appointed Prime Minister. When Peel returned and assumed leadership of the ministry for himself, he saw the impossibility of governing because of the large Whig majority in the House of Commons. Consequently, the King dissolved Parliament and forced fresh elections. Although the Tories won more seats than the previous election, they were still in the minority. Peel remained in office for a few months, but resigned after a series of parliamentary defeats. Lord Melbourne was restored to the Prime Minister's office, remaining there for the rest of William's reign.

While William was King of Hanover as well as the United Kingdom, he never visited Hanover as King.  His brother, the Duke of Cambridge, acted as regent throughout his reign.  In 1833 Hanover was given a constitution which gave political power to the middle class, and some limited power to the lower classes.  The Constitution also expanded the power of the parliament of Hanover.  The constitution was revoked after William's death by the new king, William's brother, [[Ernest Augustus I of Hanover|HRH Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland]] on the grounds that his consent, as [[heir presumptive]] to the Hanoverian throne, had not been asked.

William IV died from [[congestive heart failure|heart failure]] in 1837 in [[Windsor Castle]], where he was buried. As he had no living legitimate issue, the Crown of the United Kingdom passed to his eighteen-year-old niece, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|HRH Princess Victoria of Kent]]. Under the [[Salic Law]], a woman could not rule Hanover; thus, the Hanoverian Crown went to William IV's brother, [[Ernest Augustus I of Hanover|HRH Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland]]. William's death thus ended the personal union of Britain and Hanover, which had persisted since 1714.  Although William IV had no legitimate children, and is, therefore, not the direct ancestor of the later monarchs of the United Kingdom, he has many descendants through his illegitimate family with [[Dorothy Jordan|Mrs Jordan]], including the man elected as leader of the Conservative Party in 2005, [[David Cameron]], [[Adam Hart-Davis]] and [[Oliver Reed]].

William's reign was short, but eventful. The ascendancy of the House of Commons and the corresponding decline of the House of Lords was marked by the Reform Crisis, during which the threat of flooding the Upper House with peers was used effectively for the first time by a ministry. The weakening of the House of Lords continued during the nineteenth century, and culminated during the twentieth century with the passage of the [[Parliament Act|Parliament Act 1911]]. The same threat which had been used during the Reform Crisis&mdash;the threat to flood the House of Lords by creating several new peers&mdash;was used to procure the passage of the Parliament Act.

The reduction in the influence of the Crown was clearly indicated by the events of William's reign, especially the dismissal of the Melbourne ministry. The crisis relating to Melbourne's dismissal also indicated the reduction in the King's influence with the people. During the reign of George III, the King could have dismissed one ministry, appointed another, dissolved Parliament, and expected the people to vote in favour of the new administration. Such was the result of a dissolution in 1784, after the dismissal of the [[Coalition Ministry]]; such was the result of a dissolution in 1807, after the dismissal of [[William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville]]. But when William IV dismissed the Melbourne ministry, the Tories under Sir Robert Peel were not able to win the ensuing elections. Thus, the King's ability to influence the opinion of the people, and therefore generally dictate national policy, had been reduced. None of William's successors has attempted to remove a ministry and appoint another against the wishes of Parliament.
