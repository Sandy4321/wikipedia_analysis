'''Betty Jane Bierce''', better known by her [[stage name]] '''Jane "Poni" Adams''' (born August 7, 1921), was an [[United States|American]] actress in [[radio]], [[film]]s, and [[television]] in the 1940s and 1950s.

== Acting career ==
Adams was born in [[San Antonio, Texas]], and received a full scholarship to [[Juilliard]], which she turned down to spend years studying at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]]. From there, she got her start on [[Lux Radio Theatre]] and then with the [[Harry Conover Modeling Agency]], where she was given her nickname "Poni". (This was supposedly due to her love of [[horses]], but in reality it was to provide her with a more memorable stage name.) She returned to using her real name in 1945. 

She is best known for her role as Nina in 1945's ''[[House of Dracula]]'', but she also has the distinction of acting in early adaptations of both major [[DC Comics]] franchises: [[Batman]], where she played [[Vicki Vale]] in the second Batman serial, ''[[Batman and Robin (serial)|Batman and Robin]]'', and also a character in the first [[Superman]] television series.

== Personal life ==
Her first husband was a [[United States Navy]] [[Aviator|pilot]] who died during [[World War II]]. In 1945 she married [[Thomas K. Turnage]], a decorated Major General with the Army who served in the [[Korean War]] and earned the [[Distinguished Service Medal (Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] and [[Bronze Star]]. He later served as the last administrator for the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] before the VA became a cabinet department during [[Ronald Reagan]]'s presidential term.

They had two children.
