==Biography==
===Early life===
Garner was born in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], to Patricia Ann English, a [[teacher]], and Billy Jack Garner, a [[chemical engineer]] who worked for [[Union Carbide]]; she is the middle child between two sisters, Melissa Garner Wylie and Susannah Garner Carpenter. Her family is [[Methodist]].<ref>http://www.celebspin.com/ben-affleckn-and-jennifer-garners-daughter-baptized/</ref> At three years old, Garner began taking ballet lessons which she continued throughout her youth. Although she admitted that she loved dancing, she never had ambitions to become a classical ballerina.<ref>Murray, R, [http://movies.about.com/cs/13goingon30/a/garner13041204_2.htm Interview with Jennifer Garner]. ''[[About.com]]''. April 12, 2004. Retrieved on December 12, 2006.</ref> When she was four years old, her father's job with [[Union Carbide]] relocated her family to [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]], [[West Virginia]], where Garner resided until her [[college]] years.<ref name=AllMovieGuide>All Movie Guide, [http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=230436&mod=bio Jennifer Garner]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved on December 12, 2006.</ref>

In 1990, Garner graduated from [[George Washington High School (Charleston, West Virginia)|George Washington High School]] in Charleston, where she played the [[saxophone]]. She then enrolled at [[Denison University]] to study [[chemistry]]. Upon realizing that she enjoyed stage acting more than [[science]], Garner changed her major to [[drama]]. Garner graduated from Denison in [[1994]] and hoped to continue her drama education at [[Yale University]]. However, keen for experience, she visited a friend in [[New York City]] in [[1995]] and decided to take her chances in [[theatre]].

===Career===
In New York City, Garner earned $150 a week as an [[understudy]] in a play. She was then cast in her first television role, a part in the [[television movie|made-for-television]] movie, ''Zoya'', based on the [[Danielle Steel]] novel. Her next acting jobs were in two short-lived [[television]] series, ''Significant Others'' and ''[[Time of Your Life (TV series)|Time of Your Life]]'', as well as in two [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]] movies, including the 1997 film, ''Rose Hill'', based on the best selling book ''For The Roses'' by [[Julie Garwood]]. In 1996, she appeared in an episode of the [[NBC]] drama ''[[Law & Order]]''. She played a college student who was engaged in an affair with Det. [[Rey Curtis]]. Subsequently, Garner moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], and got a job as a hostess at a restaurant before being cast as Hannah Bibb on the [[WB Television Network|WB]] series, ''[[Felicity]]''. On the set, she met her first husband, [[Scott Foley]]. Garner played his character's girlfriend. In 1999 she played a small role in the episode "Pool" of the TV series ''[[The Pretender (TV series)|The Pretender]]''. In [[2000 in film|2000]], Garner appeared in the comedy ''[[Dude, Where's My Car?]]'', playing [[Ashton Kutcher]]'s girlfriend. In [[2001 in film|2001]], she appeared as a nurse in the big-budget epic ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'', co-starring with [[Kate Beckinsale]] and Garner's next husband [[Ben Affleck]] .

Later in 2001, [[J. J. Abrams]] (who produced ''Felicity'') approached Garner about starring in a new show he was working on for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Garner auditioned for and was cast in the role of [[Sydney Bristow]] in the spy drama ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]''. The series became a success and Garner won the award for "Best Actress in a Television Series - Drama" at the [[January 2002]] [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]]. ''Alias'' had just begun a few months beforehand, and Garner won the award with only half the season's episodes aired. The series was successful, concluding in May 2006 after a fifth, abbreviated season (due to Garner's pregnancy, a development that was written into the storyline of the fifth season). Garner's salary for the show began at $45,000 an episode, rising to $150,000 per episode by the series' end. During the show's run, Garner received four consecutive Golden Globe nominations for her lead performance. She also received four consecutive [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations for "Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series". Garner won the "Actor Award" from the [[Screen Actors Guild]] in 2005. In [[March 2005]], Garner directed the fourth-season ''Alias'' episode, "In Dreams," which aired in May. Garner received producer credit during the series' final season.

After the initial success of ''Alias'', Garner returned to her film career with a small role in the [[Steven Spielberg]] film ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', and starred alongside [[Ben Affleck]] as [[Elektra Natchios]] in the action movie ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'', an adaptation of the [[comic book]]. She reprised her role as "Elektra" in the 2005 spin-off to ''Daredevil'', entitled ''[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]''. Garner showed her comedic side in the romantic comedy ''[[13 Going on 30]]'', which was a financial success and established her as a leading feature film actress. Garner is known for performing her own stunts, and in [[January 2005]] was forced to bow out of some publicity duties for ''Elektra'', due to what was first thought to have been a viral infection but was revealed to be the effects of nerve damage to her back, caused by a stunt during the filming of the fourth season of ''Alias''.<ref>Susman, G, "[http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,1014529_1%7C%7C524946%7C0_0_,00.html Spy vs. Spine]". ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. January 6, 2005. Retrieved on December 12, 2006.</ref>
		 
Garner entered the ''[[Forbes]]''' "Power 100" list of celebrities in 2005 at 70th place.<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/lists/2005/53/Rank_3.html The Celebrity 100]. ''[[Forbes]]''.

Retrieved on December 12, 2006.</ref> During the 2006 [[Academy Awards]] ceremony, Garner stumbled on her flowing dress (designed by [[Michael Kors]]) as she came onto the stage to present the award for [[Academy Award for Sound Editing|Sound Editing]]. She did not fall, but lost her balance, and jokingly commented, "I do my own stunts!"

Garner's current film is the romantic comedy ''[[Catch and Release (film)|Catch and Release]]''. She also did voice work for the [[2006 in film|2006]] version of ''[[Charlotte's Web (2006 film)|Charlotte's Web]]''. Garner has formed a production company named [[Vandalia Films]], which will produce its first film in [[2007]]. She will produce the company's upcoming films ''Sabbatical'' and ''[[Be with You (film)|Be with You]]''. Garner takes her first role as part of an ensemble in ''[[The Kingdom (film)|The Kingdom]]'' alongside [[Jamie Foxx]] and [[Jason Bateman]]. Box office analysts have commented the choice was smart on Garner's part, as her other projects with her as the sole lead are risky gambles.  Garner was set to star in [[Zach Braff]]'s directorial feature of ''[[Open Hearts (2007 film)|Open Hearts]]'' but backed out of the project so she could spend more time with her family.

It has been reported by ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' and other media outlets that Garner has been cast to appear in the [[Jason Reitman]]-directed comedy/drama feature ''Juno'', which begins filming in [[February 2007]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]].<ref>http://comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=18491</ref><ref>http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117957729.html?categoryid=13&cs=1</ref>
