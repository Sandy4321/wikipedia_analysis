'''Lignum vitae''' is a trade [[wood]], also called '''guayacan''' or '''guaiacum''',<ref>OED entry</ref> and in parts of Europe known as '''pockholz''', from trees of the genus ''[[Guaiacum]]''. The trees are indigenous to the Caribbean and the northern coast of South America and have been an important export crop to Europe since the beginning of the 16th century. The wood was once very important for applications requiring a material with its extraordinary combination of [[Strength of materials|strength]], [[toughness]], and [[density]]. It is also the national tree of the Bahamas and the Jamaican national flower.<ref>{{Citation|title=National Symbols of Jamaica

The wood is obtained chiefly from ''[[Guaiacum officinale]]'' and ''[[Guaiacum sanctum]]'', both small, slow growing trees. All species of the genus ''Guaiacum'' are now listed in Appendix II of [[CITES]] (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) as potentially [[endangered species]]. Demand for the wood has been reduced by modern [[materials science]], which has led to [[polymer]], [[alloy]]s and [[composite material]]s that can take lignum vitae's place.

==Name==
"Lignum vitae" is [[Latin]] for "wood of life", and derives its name from its medicinal uses; lignum vitae resin has been used to treat a variety of medical conditions from [[cough]]s to [[arthritis]], and chips of the wood can also be used to brew a [[tea]]. Other names for lignum vitae include '''[[palo santo]]''' (Spanish for "holy wood") and "bastard greenheart" (not to be confused with true Greenheart ''[[Chlorocardium rodiei]]'', a popular wood in shipbuilding, cabinetry, and [[woodturning]] but a completely different timber); lignum vitae is also one of the numerous hard, dense woods loosely referred to as '''[[ironwood]]'''.

==Description==
Lignum vitae is hard and durable, and is also the densest wood traded (density: 1.23 g/cm<sup>3</sup> <ref>{{Citation|title=density heaviest wood <U+2013> WolframAlpha

  }}</ref>); it will easily sink in [[water]]. On the [[Janka hardness test|Janka Scale of Hardness]], which measures hardness of woods, lignum vitae ranks highest of the trade woods, with a Janka hardness of 4500&nbsp;[[Janka hardness test|lbf]] (compared with [[African Blackwood]] at 2940&nbsp;lbf, [[Hickory]] at 1820&nbsp;lbf, [[Northern Red Oak|red oak]] at 1290&nbsp;lbf, [[Pinus classification|Yellow Pine]] at 690&nbsp;lbf, and [[Balsa]] at 325&nbsp;lbf).

Various other hardwoods may also be called lignum vitae and should not be confused with it. The best-known come from ''[[Bulnesia arborea]]'' and ''[[Bulnesia sarmientoi]]'' (in the same [[Larreoideae|subfamily]] as ''Guaiacum'') and are known as [[Bulnesia|Verawood]] or [[Argentina|Argentine]] lignum vitae; they are somewhat similar in appearance and working qualities as genuine lignum vitae. Some hardwoods from [[Australasia]] (e.g., ''[[Vitex lignum-vitae]]'' and some species of ''[[Acacia]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus]]'') are also referred to as lignum vitae.

==Uses==
Due to the density of the wood, [[bail (cricket)|cricket bails]], in particular "heavy bails" used in windy conditions, are sometimes made of lignum vitae.  It is also sometimes used to make [[Bowls|lawn bowls]], [[croquet]] mallets, and [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]] balls.   The wood also has seen widespread historical usage in [[Mortar and pestle|mortars and pestles]] and for wood carvers' mallets.

It was the traditional wood used for the British police [[Baton (law enforcement)|truncheon]] until recently, due to its density (and strength), combined with the relative softness of wood compared to metal, thereby tending to bruise or stun rather than simply cut the skin.

The [[belaying pin]]s and [[deadeye]]s aboard [[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']] and many other sailing ships were made from lignum vitae. Due to its density and natural oils, they rarely require replacement, despite the severity of typical marine weathering conditions. The [[sheave]]s of [[block (sailing)|block]]s on sailing vessels were made of lignum vitae until the introduction of modern synthetics.

Due to lignum vitae's toughness, it can also be used as a [[lapping|lap]] in the process of cutting gems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The wood is covered with powdered industrial diamond, attached to a spindle, and used to smooth rough surfaces of gems.

Master clockmaker [[John Harrison]] used lignum vitae in the bearings and gears of his [[pendulum clock]]s and his first three [[marine chronometer]]s (all of which were large clocks rather than watches), since the wood is self-lubricating. The use of lignum vitae eliminates the need for horological [[lubricating oil]]; 18th-century horological oil would get gummy and reduce the accuracy of a timepiece under unfavourable conditions (including those that prevail at sea).

For the same reason it was widely used in water-lubricated shaft bearings for ships and hydro-electric power plants,<ref>[http://www.wenatcheeworld.com/news/2014/aug/08/rare-tour-of-rock-island-dam-takes-visitors-below-the-columbia/]</ref> and in the [[stave bearing|stern-tube bearing]]s of ship propellers <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=ytwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA156&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HR6mT6nEIsb5ggf8ovSZAQ&ved=0CDoQ6AEwATgy#v=onepage&q&f=true "Fitting Ships With Wooden Bearings"]. ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', April 1952, pp. 156<U+2013>157</ref> until the 1960s saw the introduction of sealed [[white metal]] [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]]. According to the San Francisco Maritime National Park Association website, the shaft bearings on the WWII submarine {{USS|Pampanito|SS-383}} were made of this wood.<ref>{{Citation

Also, the bearings in the original 1920s turbines of the [[Conowingo Dam#Construction and hydroelectric power generation|Conowingo hydroelectric plant]] on the lower [[Susquehanna River]] were made from lignum vitae.  The shaft bearings on the horizontal turbines at the Pointe du Bois generating station in Manitoba are made from lignum vitae. Other hydroelectric plant turbine bearings, many of them still in service, were fabricated with lignum vitae and are too numerous to list here.<ref>Discussions with various utilities operating these plants, beginning with an affiliate of the Nebraska Public Power District in 1976.  In 1976, NPPD affiliates were still using lignum vitae when turbine bearing replacements were needed.  Some of those replacements are likely to still be in service.  Lignum vitae bearings are also found in larger units at several dams in the Pacific Northwest.</ref>

The [[United Railroads of San Francisco]] (an ancestor of the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]]) began installing lignum vitae insulators to support heavy feeder wires for their trolley system in 1904.  The reason for the adoption of lignum vitae was its ability to withstand the high stress at high temperature, a problem posed by heavy cables turning corners heated by high current overloads.  Many of these insulators survived the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]] and fires, despite temperatures high enough to soften the iron poles and melt the copper cables.<ref>S. L.

According to [[T. H. White]]'s version of the [[King Arthur]] story ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', lignum vitae, from which the wand of [[Merlin]] is made, has magical powers.

[[Gabriel Garc<U+00ED>a M<U+00E1>rquez]]'s novel ''[[Love in the Time of Cholera]]'' includes a bathtub made of this wood in one of the main characters' homes. His novel ''[[Chronicle of a Death Foretold]]'' also refers to the use of this wood in making a cane for the blind Poncio Vicario.

American folksinger [[Pete Seeger]] fashioned the neck of his trademark banjo from lignum vitae.

In [[Charles Dickens]]' novel [[Bleak House]], one of the characters, Matthew Bagnet is referred to as lignum vitae, "... in compliment to the extreme hardness and toughness of his physiognomy."
