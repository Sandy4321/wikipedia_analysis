The '''Burr<U+2013>Hamilton duel''' was a [[duel]] between two prominent [[Politics of the United States|American politicians]], the former [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] and sitting [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Aaron Burr]], on July 11, 1804.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/jul11.html|title=Today in History: July 11|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref> At [[Weehawken, New Jersey|Weehawken]] in [[New Jersey]], Burr shot and mortally wounded Hamilton. Hamilton was carried to the home of William Bayard on the [[Manhattan]] shore, where he died at 2:00 p.m. the next day.

==Background==

[[Image:Schuyler.jpg|thumb|right|[[Philip Schuyler]], Hamilton's father-in-law, lost his Senate seat to Burr]]
One of the most famous personal conflicts in [[History of the United States|American history]], the Burr<U+2013>Hamilton duel arose from a long-standing political and personal bitterness that had developed between both men over a course of several years. Tensions reached a bursting point with Hamilton's journalistic defamation of Burr's character during the 1804 [[Governor of New York|New York gubernatorial race]] in which Burr was a candidate. Fought at a time when the practice of dueling was being outlawed in the northern United States, the duel had immense political ramifications. Burr, who survived the duel, was [[indictment|indicted]] for [[murder]] in both [[New York]] and [[New Jersey]], though these charges were either later dismissed or resulted in [[acquittal]]. The harsh criticism and animosity directed toward him following the duel brought an end to his political career. The [[Federalist Party]], already weakened by the defeat of [[John Adams]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1800|Presidential Election of 1800]], was further weakened by Hamilton's death.

The duel was the final skirmish of a long conflict between [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]] and Federalists. The conflict began in 1791 when Burr captured a Senate seat from [[Philip Schuyler]], Hamilton's father-in-law, who would have supported Federalist policies. (Hamilton was [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] at the time.) When the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] deadlocked in the [[United States presidential election, 1800|election of 1800]], Hamilton's maneuvering in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] caused [[Thomas Jefferson]] to be named President and Burr Vice President. In 1800, the ''[[Philadelphia Aurora]]'' printed extracts from a pamphlet Hamilton had earlier published, "Letter from Alexander Hamilton, Concerning the Public Conduct and Character of [[John Adams]], Esq. President of the United States," a document highly critical of Adams,<ref>Marcus, Maeva, and James R. Perry. ''The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789<U+2013>1800.'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1985  ([http://books.google.com/books?id=2PEjLba7EYAC&lpg=PA903&ots=d0IgmO1Nce&dq=Aurora%20published%20%22The%20Public%20Conduct%20and%20Character%20of%20John%20Adams%2C%20Esq.%2C%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States&pg=PA903#v=onepage&q=Aurora%20published%20%22The%20Public%20Conduct%20and%20Character%20of%20John%20Adams,%20Esq.,%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States&f=false Google Books link])</ref> which had actually been authored by Hamilton but intended only for private circulation. Some have claimed that Burr leaked the document, but there is no clear evidence for this, nor that Hamilton held him responsible.

[[Image:Morgan-Lewis.jpg|thumb|right|[[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]], endorsed by Hamilton, defeated Burr in the 1804 New York Gubernatorial election]]
When it became clear that Jefferson would drop Burr from his ticket in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1804|1804 election]], the Vice President ran for the [[Governor of New York|governorship of New York]] instead. Hamilton campaigned vigorously against Burr, who was running as an independent, causing him to lose to [[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]], a Democratic-Republican endorsed by Hamilton.

Both men had been involved in duels in the past. Hamilton had been a principal in 10 shot-less duels{{Clarify|date=June 2009}} prior to his fatal encounter with Burr, including duels with [[William Gordon (New Hampshire politician)|William Gordon]] (1779), [[Aedanus Burke]] (1790), [[John Francis Mercer]] (1792<U+2013>1793), [[James Nicholson (naval officer)|James Nicholson]] (1795), [[James Monroe]] (1797), and Ebenezer Purdy/[[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] (1804). He also served as a second to [[John Laurens]] in a 1779 duel with [[Charles Lee (general)|General Charles Lee]] and legal client John Auldjo in a 1787 duel with [[William Pierce (politician)|William Pierce]].<ref>Freeman, 1996, p. 294-295.</ref> In addition, Hamilton claimed to have had one previous honor dispute with Burr;<ref>Nathaniel Pendleton to Van Ness. June 26, 1804. ''Hamilton Papers'', 26:270.</ref> Burr claimed there were two.<ref>Burr to Charles Biddle. July 18, 2004. ''Papers of Aaron Burr'', 2: 887.</ref>

Additionally, Hamilton's son, [[Philip Hamilton|Philip]], was killed in a November 23, 1801 duel with [[George I. Eacker]] initiated after Philip and his friend Richard Price partook in "[[Hooliganism|hooliganish]]" behavior in Eacker's box at the [[Park Theatre (Manhattan, New York)|Park Theatre]]. This was in response to a speech, critical of Hamilton, that Eacker had made on July 3, 1801. Philip and his friend both challenged Eacker to duels when he called them "damned rascals."<ref>Fleming, 1999, p. 7-9.</ref> After Price's duel (also at Weehawken) resulted in nothing more than four missed shots, Hamilton advised his son to ''[[delope]]'' (throw away his fire). However, after both Philip and Eacker stood shotless for a minute after the command "present", Philip leveled his pistol, causing Eacker to fire, mortally wounding Philip and sending his shot awry. This duel is often cited as having a tremendous psychological impact on Hamilton in the context of the Hamilton-Burr duel.<ref>Id.</ref>

===Election of 1800===
Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton first came into public opposition during the famed [[United States presidential election, 1800|election of 1800]]. In the election, Aaron Burr ran as Vice-President on the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] ticket with [[Thomas Jefferson]] against [[John Adams]] (the incumbent [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]]). [[Electoral college]] rules at the time gave each elector two votes for president, with the candidate receiving the second most votes becoming vice president. The Democratic-Republican Party therefore planned to have 72 of their 73 electors vote for both Jefferson and Burr, with the remaining elector voting only for Jefferson. However, the electors failed to execute this plan, so Burr and Jefferson tied with 73 votes each. As mandated by the United States Constitution in the event of no candidate winning a majority, the election was moved to the [[United States House of Representatives]], which was controlled by the Federalists, many of whom were loath to vote for Jefferson. Hamilton, however, regarded Burr as far more dangerous than Jefferson and used all his influence to ensure Jefferson's election. On the 36th ballot, the House of Representatives gave Jefferson the presidency, with Burr becoming vice president.

===Charles Cooper's letter===
{{Wikisourcehas|original texts related to|[[wikisource:Hamilton-Burr duel correspondences|Hamilton-Burr duel correspondences]]}}
On April 24, 1804, a vitriolic letter originally sent from [[Charles D. Cooper]] to [[Philip Schuyler]], Hamilton's father-in-law<ref>Cooper to Philip Schuyler. ''Hamilton Papers''. April 23, 1804. 26: 246.</ref> was published in the ''Albany Register'' in the context of opposing Burr's candidacy.<ref>Cooper, Charles D. April 24, 1804. Albany Register.</ref> It claimed to describe "a still more despicable opinion which General Hamilton has expressed of Mr. Burr" at a political dinner. In a letter delivered by William P. Van Ness, Burr demanded "a prompt and unqualified acknowledgment or denial of the use of any expression which would warrant the assertion of Dr. Cooper". Hamilton's reply on May 20 indicated that he could not be held responsible for Cooper's interpretation of his words. Burr's reply on May 21, also delivered by Van Ness, stated that "political opposition can never absolve gentlemen from the necessity of a rigid adherence to the laws of honor and the rules of decorum".<ref name="Winfield 216">Winfield, 1874, p. 216.</ref> Hamilton replied that he had "no other answer to give than that which has already been given". This letter was delivered to Nathaniel Pendleton on May 22 but did not reach Burr until May 25.<ref name="Winfield 216" /> The delay was due to negotiation between Pendleton and Van Ness in which Pendleton submitted the following paper:

{{quote|General Hamilton says he cannot imagine what Dr. Cooper may have alluded, unless it were to a conversation at Mr. Taylor's, in Albany, last winter (at which he and General Hamilton were present). General Hamilton cannot recollect distinctly the particulars of that conversation, so as to undertake to repeat them, without running the risk of varying or omitting what might be deemed important circumstances. The expressions are entirely forgotten, and the specific ideas imperfectly remembered; but to the best of his recollection it consisted of comments on the political principles and views of Colonel Burr, and the results that might be expected from them in the event of his election as Governor, without reference to any particular instance of past conduct or private character.<ref>Winfield, 1875, p. 216-217.</ref>}}

The delivery of Hamilton's second letter, a second paper submitted by Pendleton further offered "in relation to any other language or conversation or language of General Hamilton which Colonel Burr will specify, a prompt or frank avowal or denial will be given." This offer was not accepted and a challenge was formally offered by Burr and accepted by Hamilton.<ref>Winfield, 1875, p. 217.</ref>

Many subsequent historians have considered the causes of the duel to be flimsy and have thus either characterized Hamilton as "suicidal", Burr as "malicious and murderous," or both.<ref>Freeman, 1996, p. 290.</ref>

==The duel==
[[Image:Hamilton-Burr pistols.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Wogdon & Barton|Wogdon]] pistols used in the duel]]
In the early morning hours of July 11, 1804, Burr and Hamilton departed by separate boats from [[Manhattan]] and rowed across the [[Hudson River]] to a spot known as the [[Weehawken, New Jersey|Heights of Weehawken]] in [[New Jersey]], a popular dueling ground below the towering cliffs of the [[New Jersey Palisades|Palisades]].<ref>Buescher, John. "[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24404 Burr-Hamilton Duel]." [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org]. Accessed 11 July 2011.</ref> Hamilton and Burr agreed to take the duel to Weehawken because although dueling had been prohibited in both states, New York more aggressively prosecuted the crime (the same site was used for 18 known duels between 1700 and 1845).<ref>Demontreux, 2004, p. 3.</ref> In an attempt to prevent the participants from being prosecuted, procedures were implemented to give all witnesses [[plausible deniability]]. For example, the pistols were transported to the island in a [[wikt:portmanteau|portmanteau]], enabling the rowers (who also stood with their backs to the duelists) to say under oath that they had not seen any pistols.<ref>Chernow, p. 700.</ref>

Burr, [[William Peter Van Ness|William P. Van Ness]] (his second), Matthew L. Davis, and another (often identified as [[Samuel Swartwout]]) plus their rowers reached the site first at half past six, whereupon Burr and Van Ness started to clear the underbrush from the dueling ground. Hamilton, [[Nathaniel Pendleton|Judge Nathaniel Pendleton]] (his second), and [[David Hosack|Dr. David Hosack]] arrived a few minutes before seven. Lots were cast for the choice of position and which second should start the duel, both of which were won by Hamilton's second who chose the upper edge of the ledge (which faced the city) for Hamilton.<ref name="Winfield 219">Winfield, 1874, p. 219.</ref> However, according to historian and author [[Joseph Ellis]], since Hamilton had been challenged, he had choice of both weapon and position. Under this account, it was Hamilton himself who chose the upstream or north side position.<ref name="Ellis 24">Ellis, Joseph. Founding Brothers. p. 24</ref>

All first-hand accounts of the duel agree that two shots were fired; however, Hamilton and Burr's seconds disagreed on the intervening time between the shots. It was common for both principals in a duel to fire a shot at the ground to exemplify courage, and then the duel could come to an end. Hamilton apparently fired first, and into the air, though it is not clear whether this was intentional, much less that Burr perceived him to be "[[delope|throwing away his fire]]" (as it did not follow the standard protocol). Burr returned fire and hit Hamilton in the lower abdomen above the right hip. The [[Musket#Ammunition|musket ball]] ricocheted off Hamilton's second or third [[False ribs|false rib]]<U+2014>fracturing it<U+2014>and caused considerable damage to his internal organs, particularly his [[liver]] and [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] before becoming lodged in his first or second [[lumbar vertebra]]. According to Pendleton's account, Hamilton collapsed immediately, dropping the pistol involuntarily, and Burr moved toward Hamilton in a speechless manner (which Pendleton deemed to be indicative of regret) before being hustled away behind an umbrella by Van Ness because Hosack and the rowers were already approaching.<ref>Winfield, 1874, p. 219-220.</ref>

It is entirely uncertain which principal fired first, as both seconds' backs were to the duel in accordance with the pre-arranged regulations of the duel (and also so the men could later testify that they "saw no fire"). After much research to determine the actual events of the duel, Pulitzer-prize winning historian Joseph J. Ellis gives his best guess:
{{quote|Hamilton did fire his weapon intentionally, and he fired first. But he aimed to miss Burr, sending his ball into the tree above and behind Burr's location. In so doing, he did not withhold his shot, but he did waste it, thereby honoring his pre-duel pledge. Meanwhile, Burr, who did not know about the pledge, did know that a projectile from Hamilton's gun had whizzed past him and crashed into the tree to his rear. According to the principles of the [[code duello]], Burr was perfectly justified in taking deadly aim at Hamilton and firing to kill.

But did he?...What is possible, but beyond the reach of the available evidence, is that Burr really missed his target, too, that his own fatal shot, in fact, was accidental. <ref name="Ellis 30">Ellis, Joseph. Founding Brothers. p. 30-31</ref>
}}

===Dr. David Hosack's account===
Dr. [[David Hosack]], the physician, wrote his account on August 17, about one month after the duel had taken place. Hosack testified that he had only seen Hamilton and the two seconds disappear "into the wood", heard two shots, and rushed to find a wounded Hamilton when his name was called. Hosack also testified that he had not seen Burr, who had been hidden behind an umbrella by Van Ness, his second.<ref>''William P. Van Ness vs. The People''. 1805.</ref> In a letter to [[William Coleman (editor)|William Coleman]], Dr. Hosack gives a very clear picture of the events:

{{quote|When called to him upon his receiving the fatal wound, I found him half sitting on the ground, supported in the arms of Mr. Pendleton. His countenance of death I shall never forget. He had at that instant just strength to say, 'This is a [[mortal wound]], doctor;' when he sunk away, and became to all appearance lifeless. I immediately stripped up his clothes, and soon, alas I ascertained that the direction of the ball must have been through some vital part. His pulses were not to be felt, his respiration was entirely suspended, and, upon laying my hand on his heart and perceiving no motion there, I considered him as irrecoverably gone. I, however, observed to Mr. Pendleton, that the only chance for his reviving was immediately to get him upon the water. We therefore lifted him up, and carried him out of the wood to the margin of the bank, where the bargemen aided us in conveying him into the boat, which immediately put off. During all this time I could not discover the least symptom of returning life. I now rubbed his face, lips, and temples with spirits of [[hartshorn]], applied it to his neck and breast, and to the wrists and palms of his hands, and endeavoured to pour some into his mouth.<ref name="Hosack Coleman">Dr. David Hosack to William Coleman, August 17, 1804</ref>}}

Dr. Hosack goes on to say that in a few minutes Hamilton had revived, either from the hartshorn or fresh air. Hosack finishes his letter:

{{quote|Soon after recovering his sight, he happened to cast his eye upon the case of pistols, and observing the one that he had had in his hand lying on the outside, he said, "Take care of that pistol; it is undischarged, and still cocked; it may go off and do harm. Pendleton knows " (attempting to turn his head towards him) 'that I did not intend to fire at him.' 'Yes,' said Mr. Pendleton, understanding his wish, 'I have already made Dr. Hosack acquainted with your determination as to that' He then closed his eyes and remained calm, without any disposition to speak; nor did he say much afterward, except in reply to my questions. He asked me once or twice how I found his pulse; and he informed me that his lower extremities had lost all feeling, manifesting to me that he entertained no hopes that he should long survive.<ref name="Hosack Coleman" />}}

===Statement to the press===
Pendleton and Van Ness issued a press statement about the events of the duel. The statement printed out the agreed upon dueling rules and events that transpired, that being given the order to present, both participants were free to open fire. After first fire had been given, the opposite's second would count to three and the opponent would fire, or sacrifice his shot.<ref name="URL">{{Ru icon}} [http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/B/hamilton/hamil43.htm From Revolution to Reconstruction: Biographies: A. Hamilton -document<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Pendleton and Van Ness disagree as to who fired the first shot, but concur that both men had fired "within a few seconds of each other" (as they must have: neither Pendleton nor Van Ness mention counting down).<ref name="URL" />

In Pendleton's amended version of the statement, he and a friend went to the site of the duel the day after Hamilton's death to discover where Hamilton's shot went. The statement reads: {{quote|They [Mr. Pendleton and an accomplice] ascertained that the ball passed through the limb of a cedar tree, at an elevation of about twelve feet and a half, perpendicularly from the ground, between thirteen and fourteen feet from the mark on which General Hamilton stood, and about four feet wide of the direct line between him and Col. Burr, on the right side; he having fallen on the left.<ref name="ReferenceA">Nathaniel Pendleton's Amended Version of His and William P. Ness's Statement of July 11, 1804</ref>}}

===Hamilton's intentions===
In ''Statement on Impending Duel with Aaron Burr'', a letter that Hamilton wrote the night before the duel,<ref>The letter is not dated, but the consensus among Hamilton's contemporaries (including Burr) and historians suggests it was written July 10, 1804, the night before the duel. See: Freeman, 1996, note 1.</ref> Hamilton stated that he was "strongly opposed to the practice of dueling" for both religious and practical reasons and continued to state:

{{quote|I have resolved, if our interview is conducted in the usual manner, and it pleases God to give me the opportunity, to reserve and throw away my first fire, and I have thoughts even of reserving my second fire.<ref>Hamilton, 1804, 26:278.</ref>}}

When Burr later learned of this, he responded: "Contemptible, if true."<ref>Joseph Wheelan, ''Jefferson's Vendetta: The Pursuit of Aaron Burr and the Judiciary'', New York, Carroll & Graf Publishers, 2005, ISBN 0786714379, p. 90</ref>

In addition, after being mortally wounded, Hamilton, upon regaining consciousness told Dr. Hosack that his gun was still loaded and that "Pendleton knows I did not mean to fire at Col. Burr the first time". This is evidence for the theory that Hamilton intended not to fire, honoring his pre-duel pledge, and only fired accidentally upon being hit.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

However, 20th century historians have debated to what extent Hamilton's statements and letter represent his true beliefs, and how much of this was a deliberate attempt to ruin Burr once and for all should worse come to worst and Hamilton fall. An example of this may be seen in what some historians have considered to be deliberate attempts to provoke Burr on the dueling ground, specifically that:

{{quote|Hamilton performed a series of deliberately provocative actions to ensure a lethal outcome. As they were taking their places, he asked that the proceedings stop, adjusted his spectacles, and slowly, repeatedly, sighted along his pistol to test his aim.<ref>Ogeden, 1979, p. 60.</ref>}}


This, along with Hamilton's conspicuous choice of dueling pistols (the same pair which had once shot a button off Aaron Burr's coat some five years earlier during a duel with Hamilton's brother-in-law), has caused many historians in recent years to re-examine the circumstances of the engagement and Hamilton's true intentions on the morning of the 11th of July.

===Burr's intentions===
Burr had a reputation for being a poor shot, but there is little doubt that he had every intention of seeking full satisfaction from Hamilton by blood.<ref>Winfield. 1874. p. 220.</ref> The afternoon after the duel, Burr was quoted as boasting that had his vision not been impaired by the morning [[mist]], he would have shot Hamilton in the [[heart]].<ref>''N.Y. Spectator''. July 28, 1824.</ref> According to the account of [[Jeremy Bentham]], who met with Burr in 1808 in England (four years after the fact), Burr claimed to have been certain of his ability to kill Hamilton, and Bentham concluded that Burr was "little better than a murderer."<ref>Sabine. 1857. p. 212.</ref>

Towards the end of his life, Burr remarked: "Had I read [[Laurence Sterne|Sterne]] more and [[Voltaire]] less, I should have known the world was wide enough for Hamilton and me."<ref>[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1975/5/1975_5_45.shtml AmericanHeritage.com / The Fateful Encounter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

There is, however, much evidence in Burr's defense. Had Hamilton apologized for his "despicable opinion of Mr. Burr",<ref>[http://www.wright.edu/studentorgs/pat/doc/burrhamilton.pdf Steven C. Smith. My Friend Hamilton-Whom I Shot]</ref> all would have been forgotten. However neither principal could avoid the confrontation honorably and thus each was forced into a duel: Burr to regain his honor and Hamilton to sustain his.<ref>Joanne B. Freedman. Dueling as Politics: Reinterpreting the Burr-Hamilton Duel</ref>

Furthermore, Burr was unsure of Hamilton's intentions (as historians still are today). Seeing Hamilton fire into the brush above his head, Burr could not be sure if Hamilton had thrown his shot or simply missed his target. According to the principles of the ''[[code duello]]'' Burr was entirely justified in taking aim at Hamilton. Furthermore, it is not clear that Burr did more than react to hearing Hamilton fire, before he had any time to realize where the shot went.

===The pistols===
Others have attributed Hamilton's apparent misfire to the design of the [[Wogdon & Barton|Wogdon]] [[duelling pistol]]s (both of which survive today), which incorporated a hair-trigger feature that could be pre-set by the user. According to [[Louisiana State University]] history professors Andrew Burstein and Nancy Isenberg, "Hamilton brought the pistols, which had a larger barrel than regular dueling pistols, and a secret hair-trigger, and were therefore much more deadly."<ref name=Salon>Burstein, Andrew and Isenberg, Nancy (2011-01-04) [http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/01/04/burstein_isenberg_bachmann_bur/index.html What Michele Bachmann doesn't know about history], ''[[Salon.com]]''</ref> They conclude that "Hamilton gave himself an unfair advantage in their duel, and got the worst of it anyway."<ref name=Salon/>

Only Hamilton, familiar with the weapons, would have known about and been able to use the hair-trigger. However, when asked by Pendleton before the duel if he would use the "hair-spring", Hamilton reportedly replied "not this time."<ref name="Winfield 219" /> The "hair-spring" feature gave an advantage because it reduced the time required to fire the pistol, being more sensitive to the movement of the trigger finger.

The pistols belonged to Hamilton's brother-in-law [[John Barker Church]], who was a business partner of both Hamilton and Burr. Later legend claimed that these pistols were the same ones used in a 1799 duel between Church and Burr, in which neither man was injured.<ref>Alexander Hamilton, by Ron Chernow</ref> Aaron Burr, however, claimed in his memoirs that he supplied the duelling pistols for his duel with Church, and that they belonged to him.<ref>Memoirs of Aaron Burr, by Matthew L. Davis.</ref> Hamilton biographer [[Ron Chernow]] accepts Burr's version of the story.<ref>Alexander Hamilton, by Ron Chernow, p.590</ref>

In 1801, Hamilton's son Philip used the Church weapons in the duel in which he died. The pistols reposed at Church's estate [[Belvidere (Belmont, New York)|Belvidere]] until the late 19th century.<ref name="nrhpinv_ny">{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=236|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Belvidere|date=August 1971|accessdate=2009-06-14 |author=Robert Bromeley and Mrs. Patrick W.

Morgan Chase & Co.|JPMorgan Chase & Co]].

For the [[United States Bicentennial]] anniversary in 1976, Chase Manhattan allowed the pistols to be removed and loaned to the U.S. Bicentennial Society of Richmond. A subsequent article in the Smithsonian magazine claimed that close examination of the pistols had revealed a secret hair trigger.<ref>[http://www.aaronburrassociation.org/Smithsonian.htm Pistols shed light on famed duel] (Smithsonian magazine, November 1976)</ref>
However, for the preceding twenty years English duelling pistols had been customarily fitted with hair triggers, which were known as set triggers.  Duelling pistols made by Robert Wogdon were no exception. They cannot therefore be said to have had 'secret' hair triggers.<ref>The British Duelling Pistol, John Atkinson, Arms and Armour Press, 1978</ref>

==Aftermath==
A mortally wounded Hamilton died the following day and was buried in the [[Trinity Churchyard Cemetery]] in Manhattan (Hamilton was an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]]). [[Gouverneur Morris]], a political ally of Hamilton's, gave the eulogy at his funeral and established a private fund to support his widow and children.

Burr was charged with murder in [[New York]] and [[New Jersey]], but neither charge reached trial. In [[Bergen County, New Jersey]], a [[grand jury]] indicted Burr for [[murder]] in November 1804<ref>Buescher, John. "[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24404 Burr-Hamilton Duel]." [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org]. Accessed 11 July 2011.</ref>, but the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] quashed the indictment on a motion from Colonel Ogden.<ref>''Centinel of Freedom''. November 24, 1807, cited in Winfield, 1874, p. 220.</ref> Burr fled to [[South Carolina]], where his daughter lived with her family, but soon returned to [[Washington, D.C.]] to complete his term of service as Vice President. He presided over the [[Samuel Chase#Impeachment|Samuel Chase impeachment trial]] "with the dignity and impartiality of an angel and the rigor of a devil."{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Burr's heartfelt farewell speech in March 1805 moved some of his harshest critics in the Senate to tears.<ref>[http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Indicted_Vice_President_Bids_Senate_Farewell.htm U.S. Senate: Art & History Home > Historical Minutes > 1801<U+2013>1850 > Indicted Vice President Bids Senate Farewell<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
[[Image:Hamiltonmonumentmap.jpg|thumb|left|An 1841 map showing the location of a Hamilton Monument.]]

With his political career apparently over, Burr went west, where he became involved in "filibuster" plans, which some later claimed were intended to establish a new independent empire carved out of the [[Louisiana territory]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} [[James Wilkinson|General James Wilkinson]], who had worked with Burr, later had a change of heart and betrayed their plans to [[Thomas Jefferson|President Jefferson]]. Another man Burr allegedly tried to recruit, [[William Eaton]], accused Burr in letters to Jefferson, resulting in Burr's [[Burr conspiracy|arrest and trial for treason]]. Although he was acquitted of all charges, Burr's reputation was further damaged and he spent the following years in Europe. He finally returned to [[New York City]] in 1812, where he resumed his law practice and spent the remainder of his life in relative obscurity.

===Monuments===
[[File:HamiltonRestingRock.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Boulder where Hamilton may have rested.]]
[[File:HamiltonBust.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Bust from 1935.]]
The first memorial to the duel was constructed in 1806 by the [[Saint Andrew Society]], of which Hamilton was formerly a member. A 14 foot [[marble]] [[cenotaph]], consisting of an [[obelisk]] topped by a flaming urn and a plaque with a quote from [[Horace]] surrounded by an iron fence, was constructed approximately where Hamilton was believed to have fallen.<ref>Demontreux, 2004, p. 3-4.</ref> Duels continued to be fought at the site and the marble was slowly vandalized and removed for souvenirs, leaving nothing remaining by 1820. The memorial's plaque survived, turning up in a junk store and finding its way to the [[New York Historical Society]] in [[Manhattan]], where it still resides.<ref>Demontreux, 2004, p. 4.</ref>

From 1820 to 1857, the site was marked by two stones with the names Hamilton and Burr placed where they were thought to have stood during the duel. When a road from [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] to [[Fort Lee, New Jersey|Fort Lee]] was built through the site in 1858, an inscription on a boulder where a mortally wounded Hamilton was thought to have rested<U+2014>one of the many pieces of [[graffiti]] left by visitors<U+2014>was all that remained. No primary accounts of the duel confirm the boulder anecdote. In 1870, [[railroad]] tracks were built directly through the site, and the boulder was hauled to the top of the Palisades, where it remains today.<ref>Demontreux, 2004, p. 5.</ref> In 1894, an iron fence was built around the boulder, supplemented by a bust of Hamilton and a plaque. The bust was thrown over the cliff on October 14, 1934 by vandals and the head was never recovered; a new bust was installed on July 12, 1935.<ref>Demontreux, 2004, p. 6.</ref>

The plaque was stolen by vandals in the 1980s and an abbreviated version of the text was inscribed on the indentation left in the boulder, which remained until the 1990s when a granite pedestal was added in front of the boulder and the bust was moved to the top of the pedestal. New markers were added on July 11, 2004, the 200th anniversary of the duel.<ref>Demontreux, 2004, p. 7-9.</ref>

===Anti-dueling movement in New York state===
In the months and years following the duel, a movement started to end the practice. [[Eliphalet Nott]], the pastor at an Albany church attended by Hamilton's father-in-law, [[Philip Schuyler]], gave a sermon that was soon reprinted, "A Discourse, Delivered in the North Dutch Church, in the City of Albany, Occasioned by the Ever to be Lamented Death of General Alexander Hamilton, July 29, 1804'. In 1806, [[Lyman Beecher]] delivered an anti-dueling sermon, later reprinted in 1809 by the Anti-Dueling Association of New York. The covers and some pages of both pamphlets:

==Popular culture==
The first television commercial in the "[[Got Milk?]]" advertising campaign referred comically to the duel as the subject of a Trivia question: "Who shot Alexander Hamilton in that famous duel?"<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-88599730.html Encyclopedia.com: PR Newswire "Classic GOT MILK? TV Spot <U+2013> 'Aaron Burr' <U+2013> is back on air]</ref> asked by a DJ on the radio of someone who was working at a museum which contained an extensive display concerning the event, and many items from the duel itself. He answers the question correctly, but because his mouth is full of peanut butter and he has no milk to wash it down, his answer is unintelligible.<ref>[http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2009/aaron-burr-got-milk/ Aaron Burr Got Milk? at the Inspiration Room]</ref><ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806EEDE113BF930A1575AC0A9619C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=3 NY Times: How Do You Say 'Got Milk' En Espa<U+00F1>ol?]</ref>

In 2005, a viral rap music video "[[Lazy Sunday]]" released as an [[SNL Digital Short]] contained the line "It's all about the Hamiltons" ([[United States ten-dollar bill|$10 bills]]) as a spoof on the 1998 Puff Daddy hit single "[[It's All about the Benjamins]]" ([[United States one hundred-dollar bill|$100 bills]]). A subsequent line in the song then stated, "You can call us Aaron Burr from the way we're dropping Hamiltons", comically drawing a tie between extravagant spending to the outcome of the historic duel.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/27/arts/television/27samb.html Instant Notoriety for a Rap Video From Saturday Night Live <U+2013> New York Times]</ref>

In 2006, an improv comedic group called "Code Duello" started live performances in [[Boston]] with a half-hour act focused on the duel.<ref>[http://www.codeduelloimprov.com/newphotovideo.htmln Code Duello: Hamilton & Burr]</ref>

Then in 2008, the story of the duel was again comedically told, this time in an [[Upright Citizens Brigade]] video starring [[Michael Cera]] as Hamilton, presenting the "[[Delope#Notable uses|delope]]" version of the story where Hamilton is said to have purposely aimed away from Burr.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/01/24/junos-michael-cera-reenac_n_83145.html Juno's Michael Cera Re-Enacts Historical Duel Between Alexander Hamilton And Aaron Burr]</ref>
