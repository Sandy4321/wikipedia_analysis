'''Yukon''' ({{IPAEng|<U+02C8>ju<U+02D0>k<U+0252>n}}) is the westernmost and smallest of [[Canada|Canada's]] three [[Territories of Canada|territories]]. It was named after the [[Yukon River]], Yukon meaning "Great River" in [[Gwich<U+2019>in language|Gwich<U+2019>in]].

The name Yukon Territory may also be used, although this usage is disputed by residents of the territory. The federal government's most recent update of the ''Yukon Act'' in 2003 confirmed Yukon, rather than Yukon Territory, as the current usage standard.<ref>[http://www.canlii.org/ca/sta/y-2.01/ CanLII - Federal - S.C. 2002, c. 7]</ref>

At 5,959 metres (19,551 ft), the Yukon's [[Mount Logan]], in [[Kluane National Park and Reserve]], is the highest mountain in Canada and the second highest of [[North America]] (after [[Mount McKinley]]).

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of the Yukon}}
[[Image:yukonwikimap.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Map of the Yukon.]]
The very sparsely populated territory abounds with snow-melt lakes and perennial white-capped mountains. Although the climate is Arctic and subarctic and very dry, with long, cold winters, the long sunshine hours in short summer allow hardy crops and vegetables, along with a profusion of flowers and fruit to blossom.

The territory is the approximate shape of a right triangle, bordering the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alaska]] to the west, the [[Northwest Territories]] to the east and [[British Columbia]] to the south. Its northern coast is on the [[Beaufort Sea]]. Its ragged eastern boundary mostly follows the [[Drainage divide|divide]] between the Yukon Basin and the [[Mackenzie River]] [[drainage basin]] to the east in the Mackenzie mountains. Its capital is [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]].

Canada's highest point, Mount Logan ({{convert|5959|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=/}}), is found in the territory's southwest. Mount Logan and a large part of the Yukon's southwest are in [[Kluane National Park and Reserve]], a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]. Other national parks include [[Ivvavik National Park]] and [[Vuntut National Park]] in the north. 

Most of the territory is in the watershed of its namesake, the Yukon River. The southern Yukon is dotted with a large number of large, long and narrow glacier-fed alpine lakes, most of which flow into the Yukon River system. The larger lakes include [[Teslin Lake]], [[Atlin Lake]], [[Tagish Lake]], [[Marsh Lake]], [[Lake Laberge]], [[Kusawa Lake]], and [[Kluane Lake]]. [[Lake Bennett (British Columbia)|Lake Bennett, B.C.,]] on the Klondike Gold Rush trail is a lake flowing into Nares Lake, with the greater part of its area within the Yukon.

Other watersheds include the Mackenzie River and the [[Alsek River|Alsek]]-[[Tatshenshini River|Tatshenshini]], as well as a number of rivers flowing directly into the Beaufort Sea. The two main Yukon rivers flowing into the Mackenzie in the Northwest Territories are the [[Liard River]] in the southeast and the [[Peel River (Canada)|Peel River]] and its tributaries in the northeast.

The capital, Whitehorse, is also the largest city, with about two-thirds of the population; the second largest is [[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson City]], (pop. 1,250) which was the capital until 1952.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Yukon}}
[[Image:Dempster1.jpg|thumb|left|Richardson Mountains in the background]]
Long before the arrival of Europeans, central and northern Yukon escaped [[Glacier|glaciation]] as it was part of Beringia ([[Bering land bridge]]). Remains of human inhabitation were found near [[Old Crow, Yukon|Old Crow]] appearing to be the oldest in North America. Around AD 800, the [[volcano|volcanic]] eruption of [[Mount Churchill]] near the [[Alaska]] border blanketed southern Yukon with a layer of [[Volcanic ash|ash]] which can  still be seen along the [[Klondike Highway]]. Coastal and interior [[First Nations]] already had extensive trading networks and European incursions into the area only began early in the 19th century with the [[fur trade]], followed by [[Missionary|missionaries]] and the [[Russian-American telegraph|Western Union Telegraph Expedition]]. By the latter end of the 19th century gold miners were trickling in on rumours of gold, creating a population increase justifying the setting up of a police force, just in time for 1897's start of the [[Klondike Gold Rush]]. The increased population coming with the gold rush led to the separation of the Yukon district from the Northwest Territories and the formation of the separate Yukon Territory.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Yukon}}

=== Ethnicity ===
According to the [[Canada 2001 Census|2001 Canadian census]],<ref>[http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo26l.htm Population by selected ethnic origins, by province and territory (2001 Census) (Yukon Territory)]</ref> the largest ethnic group in Yukon is [[English people|English]] (27.1%), followed by [[First Nations]] (22.3%), [[Scottish people|Scottish]] (21.9%), [[Irish people|Irish]] (19.1%), [[German people|German]] (14.3%), and [[French people|French]] (13.4%) - although over a quarter of all respondents also identified their ethnicity as "Canadian."

==Economy==
The Yukon's historical major industry has been [[mining]] ([[lead]], [[zinc]], [[silver]], [[gold]], [[asbestos]] and [[copper]]). The government acquired the land from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1870 and split it from the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1898 to fill the need for local government created by the population influx of the gold rush. 

Thousands of these prospectors flooded the territory, creating a colourful period recorded by authors such as [[Robert W. Service]] and [[Jack London]]. The memory of this period and the early days of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], as well as the territory's scenic wonders and outdoor recreation opportunities, makes [[tourism]] the second most important industry. 

Manufacturing, including furniture, clothing, and handicrafts, follows in importance, along with [[hydroelectricity]]. The traditional industries of [[Animal trapping|trapping]] and [[fishing]] have declined. Today, the government sector is by far the biggest employer in the territory, directly employing approximately 5,000 out of a labour force of 12,500.

=== Tourism ===
[[Image:33.Yukonsign.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Yukon Sign]]
Yukon's tourism motto is "Larger than life".<ref>[http://www.travelyukon.com/en/ Travel Yukon]</ref> The Yukon's major appeal is its nearly pristine nature. Tourism relies heavily on this, and there are many organised [[outfitter]]s and [[guide]]s available to [[Hunting|hunters]] and [[Fisherman|anglers]] and nature lovers of all sorts. Sports enthusiasts can paddle lakes and rivers with [[canoe]]s and [[kayak]]s, ride or walk endless trails, [[ski]] or [[snowboard]] in an organized setting or access the [[backcountry skiing|backcountry]] by air or [[snowmobile]], climb the highest peaks of North America or take a family hike up smaller mountains, or try [[ice climbing]] and [[dog sled]]ding.

The Yukon also has a wide array of cultural and sporting events and infrastructures that attract [[artist]]s, participants and tourists from all parts of the world ([[Yukon International Storytelling Festival]], Frostbite Music Festival,<ref>[http://www.frostbitefest.ca/ Frostbite Music Festival]</ref> Dawson Music Festival,<ref>[http://www.dcmf.com Dawson Music Festival]</ref> [[Yukon Quest]], Sourdough Rendezvous, the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre,<ref>[http://www.beringia.com/ Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre]</ref> Northern Lights Centre,<ref>[http://www.northernlightscentre.ca/ Northern Lights Centre]</ref> Klondike Gold Rush memorials and activities, "[[Takhini Hot Springs]]", and the Whitehorse fish ladder.<ref>[http://www.yukonenergy.ca/services/facilities/fishway/ Whitehorse fish ladder]</ref>

There are many opportunities to experience pre-colonial lifestyles by learning about Yukon's First Nations.<ref>[http://www.yfnta.org/ Yukon First Nation Tourist Association]</ref> Wildlife and nature observation is exceptional and a wide variety of large [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[fish]] are easily accessible, whether or not within Yukon's many territorial<ref>[http://environmentyukon.gov.yk.ca/parksconservation/yukonparks.php Territorial Parks]</ref> [[park]]s (Herschel Island Qikiqtaruk Territorial Park,<ref>[http://environmentyukon.gov.yk.ca/parksconservation/HerschelIslandQikiqtaruk.php Herschel Island Qikiqtaruk Territorial Park]</ref> Tombstone Territorial Park,<ref>[http://environmentyukon.gov.yk.ca/parksconservation/tombstonepark.php Tombstone Territorial Park]</ref> Fishing Branch Ni'iinlii'njik Park,<ref>[http://environmentyukon.gov.yk.ca/parksconservation/FishingBranch.php Fishing Branch Ni'iinlii'njik Park]</ref> Coal River Springs Territorial Park<ref>[http://environmentyukon.gov.yk.ca/parksconservation/CoalRiverSprings.php Coal River Springs Territorial Park]</ref>) and [[National Parks of Canada|national parks]] ([[Kluane National Park and Reserve]], [[Vuntut National Park]], [[Ivvavik National Park]]) and [[Nature reserve|reserves]], or nearby [[Liard River Hot Springs Provincial Park]] in [[British Columbia]].

On the long cold clear nights of winter, nature provides the ultimate natural spectacle in the form of [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora borealis]].

==Transportation== 

Before modern forms of transportation, the rivers and mountain passes were the main transportation routes for the coastal [[Tlingit]] people trading with the Athabascans of which the [[Chilkoot Pass]] and [[Dalton Trail]], as well as the first Europeans.

From the Gold Rush until the 1950s, riverboats plied the Yukon River, mostly between Whitehorse and Dawson City, with some making their way further to Alaska and over to the [[Bering Sea]], and other tributaries of Yukon River such as the [[Stewart River]]. Most of the riverboats were owned by the British-Yukon Navigation Company, an arm of the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]], which also operated a [[narrow gauge railway]] between [[Skagway, Alaska]], and Whitehorse. The railway ceased operation in the 1980s with the first closure of the [[Faro, Yukon|Faro]] mine. It is now run during the summer months for the tourism season, with operations as far as [[Carcross, Yukon|Carcross]].

Today, major land routes include the [[Alaska Highway]], the [[Klondike Highway]] (between Skagway and Dawson City), the [[Haines Highway]] (between [[Haines, Alaska]], and [[Haines Junction, Yukon|Haines Junction]]), and the [[Dempster Highway]] (linking [[Inuvik, Northwest Territories]] to the Klondike Highway), all paved except for the Dempster. Other highways with less traffic include the "[[Robert Campbell Highway]]" linking [[Carmacks, Yukon|Carmacks]] (on the Klondike Highway) to [[Watson Lake, Yukon|Watson Lake]] (Alaska Highway) via Faro and [[Ross River, Yukon|Ross River]], and the "[[Silver Trail]]" linking the old silver mining communities of [[Mayo, Yukon|Mayo]], [[Elsa, Yukon|Elsa]] and [[Keno City, Yukon|Keno City]] to the Klondike Highway at the Stewart River bridge. Air travel is the only way to reach the far north community of Old Crow.

[[Whitehorse International Airport]] serves as the air transport infrastructure hub, with direct flights to [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], and [[Frankfurt]] (summer months). Every Yukon community is served by an [[List of airports in the Yukon|airport]]. The communities of Dawson City, Old Crow, and Inuvik, have regular passenger service through [[Air North]]. Air charter businesses exist primarily to serve the tourism and mining exploration industries.

==Government and politics==
[[Image:Chief Isaac of Han.jpg|thumb|Chief Isaac of the Han, Yukon Territory, ca. 1898]]
In the 19th century, Yukon was a segment of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]-administered [[North-Western Territory]] and then the Canadian-administered Northwest Territories. It only obtained a recognizable local government in 1895 when it became a separate [[Districts of the Northwest Territories|district of the Northwest Territories]].<ref>Coates and Morrison, p.74</ref> In 1898, it was made a separate territory with its own commissioner and appointed Territorial Council.<ref>Coates and Morrison, p.103</ref>

Prior to 1979, the territory was administered by the [[Commissioner#Canadian territories|commissioner]] who is appointed by the federal [[Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (Canada)|Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development]]. The commissioner used to chair and had a role in appointing the territory's ''Executive Council'' and had a day to day role in governing the territory. The elected ''Territorial Council'' had a purely advisory role. In 1979, a significant degree of power was [[Devolution|devolved]] from the federal government and commissioner to the territorial legislature which, in that year, adopted a party system of [[responsible government]]. This was done through a letter from [[Jake Epp]], the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development rather than through formal legislation.

The ''Yukon Act'', passed on [[April 1]], [[2003]], formalised the powers of the Yukon government and devolved additional powers to the territorial government (e.g., control over land and natural resources). As of 2003, other than criminal prosecutions, the Yukon government has much of the same powers as provincial governments, and the other two territories are looking to obtaining the same powers. Today the role of commissioner is analogous to that of a provincial [[lieutenant governor]]; however, unlike lieutenant-governors, commissioners are not formal representatives of the [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen]] but are employees of the federal government. 

In preparation for [[responsible government]], political parties were organised and ran candidates to the [[Yukon Legislative Assembly]] for the first time in 1978. The [[Yukon Party|Progressive Conservatives]] won these elections and formed the first party government of Yukon in January 1979. The [[Yukon New Democratic Party]] (NDP) formed the government from 1985 to 1992 under [[Tony Penikett]] and again from 1996 under [[Piers McDonald]] until being defeated in 2000. The conservatives returned to power in 1992 under [[John Ostashek]] after having renamed themselves the [[Yukon Party]]. The [[Yukon Liberal Party|Liberal]] government of [[Pat Duncan]] was defeated in elections in November 2002, with [[Dennis Fentie]] of the Yukon Party forming the government as [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]]. 

Although there has been discussion in the past about Yukon becoming Canada's 11th province, it is generally felt that its population base is too sparse for this to occur at present.

At the federal level, the territory is presently represented in the [[Parliament of Canada]] by a single [[Member of Parliament]] and one [[Senate of Canada|senator]]. Canadian territories' members of Parliament are full and equal voting representatives and residents of the territory enjoy the same rights as other Canadian citizens. One Yukon Member of Parliament &mdash; [[Erik Nielsen]] &mdash; was the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Canada|Deputy Prime Minister]] under the government of [[Brian Mulroney]], while another &mdash; [[Audrey McLaughlin]] &mdash; was the leader of the federal [[New Democratic Party]].

Yukon was one of nine jurisdictions in Canada to offer [[same-sex marriage in Yukon|same-sex marriage]] before the passage of Canada's [[Civil Marriage Act]].

===Federal government representation===
In the [[Canadian House of Commons]], Yukon is represented by [[Larry Bagnell]], representing the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]]. Mr. Bagnell was first elected to the House of Commons in 2000. Previous Members of Parliament include [[Louise Hardy]] (NDP, 1997-2000), [[Audrey McLaughlin]] (NDP, 1987-1997), Erik Nielsen ([[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]], 1957-1987), [[James Aubrey Simmons]] (Liberal, 1949-1957). 

Yukon has been represented by two Senators since the position was created in 1975. The [[Senate of Canada]] position is currently vacant (since December 2006). It was last filled by [[Ione Christensen]], representing the Liberal Party. Appointed to the Senate in 1999 by Prime Minister [[Jean Chr<U+00E9>tien]], Mrs. Christensen resigned in December 2006 to help her ailing husband. From 1975 to 1999, [[Paul Lucier]] (Liberal) served as Senator for the Yukon. Lucier was appointed by Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]].

===First Nations governments===
Much of the population of the territory is [[First Nations]]. An [[Yukon Land Claims|umbrella land claim agreement]] representing 7,000 members of fourteen different First Nations was signed with the federal government in 1992. Each of the individual First Nations then has to negotiate a specific land claim and a self-government agreement. As of December 2005, eleven of the 14 First Nations had a signed agreement. The fourteen First Nation governments are:

The territory once had an [[Inuit]] settlement, located on [[Herschel Island]] off the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] coast. This settlement was dismantled in 1987 and its inhabitants relocated to the neighboring Northwest Territories. As a result of the [[Inuvialuit]] [[Inuvialuit Final Agreement|Final Agreement]], the island is now a territorial park and is known officially as [[Qikiqtaruk Territorial Park]], Qikiqtaruk being the name of the island in [[Inuvialuktun]]. There are also 14 First Nations that speak 8 different languages.
