'''Menedemus''' ({{lang-el|<U+039C><U+03B5><U+03BD><U+03AD><U+03B4><U+03B7><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}), lived [[3rd century BC]], was a [[Cynic]] philosopher, and a pupil of the [[Epicurean]] [[Colotes|Colotes of Lampsacus]].<ref name="diog1">Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, vi.</ref> [[Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius]] states that he used to go about garbed as a [[Erinyes|Fury]], proclaiming himself a sort of spy from [[Hades]]:
<blockquote>He assumed the garb of a [[Erinyes|Fury]], and went about saying that he had come from [[Hades]] to take notice of all who did wrong, in order that he might descend there again and make his report to the deities who live in that country. And this was his dress: a tunic of a dark colour reaching to his feet, and a purple girdle round his waist, an Arcadian hat on his head with the twelve signs of the [[zodiac]] embroidered on it, [[Buskin|tragic buskins]], a preposterously long beard, and an ashen staff in his hand.<ref name="diog1"/></blockquote>

However, [[Wilhelm Cr<U+00F6>nert]] argued<ref>Cr<U+00F6>nert, W., ''Kolotes and Menedemos'', Munich (1906).</ref> that this story is actually derived from one of the satires (the ''Necromancy'') of [[Menippus]],<ref>Note also that the [[Suda]] relates this Fury story about Menippus, not Menedemus.</ref> and that parallels to this story can be found in the dialogues of [[Lucian]] which are based on those of Menippus.

The claim that Menedemus was originally a pupil of [[Colotes|Colotes of Lampsacus]], on the other hand, may be true. Two [[papyri]] from [[Herculaneum]] show that Menedemus criticized Colotes on [[Epicurean]] opinions concerning [[poetry]].<ref>Herculaneum Papyri, 208, 1082.</ref>
