The second '''USS ''Bazely'' (DE-2)''' was a [[lend lease]] [[destroyer escort]] in the [[United States Navy]]. She served in the [[Royal Navy]] as '''HMS ''Bazely'' (K311)'''. She was named for [[John Bazely]].

''Bazely'' was laid down on 5 April 1942 by the [[Boston Navy Yard]] and launched on 27 June 1942. Allocated to the Royal Navy under lend lease on 18 February 1943, ''Bazely'' given the pendant number K311. She earned battle honors in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] between 1943 and 1945 and in the [[Arctic Ocean]] in 1945. During her wartime career under the White Ensign, she figured prominently in the destruction of three [[Germany|German]] [[submarine]]s. She teamed with {{HMS|Blackwood|K347}} and {{HMS|Drury|K316}} on 23 November 1943 to sink [[Unterseeboot 648|''U-648'']] and, together with ''Blackwood'' sank [[Unterseeboot 600|''U-600'']] on 25 November. Her third and last "kill" came on 21 April 1945, shortly before the end of the war in [[Europe]], when she cooperated with ''Drury'' and {{HMS|Bentinck|K314}} to destroy [[Unterseeboot 636|''U-636'']].

The Royal Navy returned ''Bazely'' to American hands on 20 August 1945 at [[Chatham, England]]. Manned by officers and men from the frigate {{USS|Surprise|PG-63}}, that had been turned over to the Royal Navy after service in the U.S. Navy under reverse lend lease, the former [[Captain class frigate|''Captain''-class]] [[frigate]] was commissioned as ''Bazely'' (DE 2) at 0810 the day of her return (20 August 1945). Lt. Lester H. Watson, USNR, in command

After having embarking 39 passengers, ''Bazely'' got underway eight days later for the first leg of her homeward voyage. The next morning, she stood out of [[The Downs]] and sailed in Task Group (TG) 21.3, one of ten former British DE's being returned to the country of their origin. She reached the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]] on the evening of 8 September 1945, and remained there, inactive save for shifting berths and unloading ammunition at [[Fort Mifflin]], through mid October. On the afternoon of 22 October 1945, ''Bazely'' was decommissioned. Her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy list]] on 16 November 1945, and the navy yard completed breaking her up by 28 May 1946.
