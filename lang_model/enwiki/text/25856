'''''Stripped''''' is the fourth [[studio album]] by American recording artist [[Christina Aguilera]], released on October 25, 2002 by [[RCA Records]]. Looking to transition from the [[teen pop]] styles of [[Christina Aguilera (album)|her self-titled debut album]] (1999), Aguilera took creative control over her next album project, both musically and lyrically. She also changed her public image and established her new [[alter ego]], "Xtina". Musically, its music incorporates [[pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] with influences from many different genres, including [[soul music|soul]], [[metal music|metal]], [[rock music|rock]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[Latin music|Latin]]. Lyrically, most of the songs from the album discuss the theme of self-respect, while a few other songs talk about [[sexual intercourse|sex]] and [[feminism]]. As [[executive producer]], Aguilera enlisted many new collaborators for the album.

Upon its release, ''Stripped'' received generally mixed reviews from music critics, most of them criticized its lack of musical focus, while some of them called it an album for grown-ups. However, the album received multiple [[Grammy Award]] nominations, including one won. Commercially, ''Stripped'' debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 330,000 copies. Consequently, it was certified [[RIAA certification|quadruple platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for shipping over 4.3 million copies in the region alone. The album also charted within the top five of charts in Canada, Europe, the Netherlands, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It was Aguilera's best-performing album in the UK, becoming the 29th best-selling album of the 2000s decade there with 1,850,852 copies sold. As of June 2006, ''Stripped'' had sold over 12 million copies worldwide.  

Five [[single (music)|singles]] were released from the album. The lead single, "[[Dirrty]]", was met with mixed reviews from critics due to its sound and criticism due to its sexual music video. The follow-up, "[[Beautiful (Christina Aguilera song)|Beautiful]]", was praised by critics and garnered chart success worldwide. The third single, "[[Fighter (song)|Fighter]]", became Aguilera's third top-ten hit worldwide from ''Stripped''. The two last singles from ''Stripped'' were "[[Can't Hold Us Down]]" and "[[The Voice Within]]", which performed moderately on charts. Aguilera performed several songs from ''Stripped'' live during a number of shows, notably during the [[2002 MTV Europe Music Awards]], the [[American Music Awards of 2003]], and the [[2003 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Two concert tours were held to promote the album, The [[Justified and Stripped Tour]] (2003) and [[The Stripped Tour]] (2003).

==Concept==
===Background===
[[File:Alicia Keys 2011.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Alicia Keys]] ''(pictured)'' was one of the producers on ''Stripped''.]]
Following the release of her [[Christina Aguilera (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1999, Aguilera had achieved major success with four worldwide hits, including "[[Genie in a Bottle]]" and "[[What a Girl Wants (Christina Aguilera song)|What a Girl Wants]]".<ref name="USAToday"/> Following that, she continued to garner major success with "[[Lady Marmalade#Moulin Rouge! cover|Lady Marmalade]]" (2001), a cover of [[LaBelle]] which features [[Lil' Kim]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] and [[M<U+00FD>a]].<ref name="USAToday"/> Despite the international success, Aguilera was unsatisfied with the music and image that her management, [[Steve Kurtz]], had created for her, having been marketed as a [[bubblegum pop]] singer because of the genre's financial lure.<ref name="puppet">{{cite news|last=Stitzel|first=Kim|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/a/aguilera_christina/news_feature_feb_02/|title=Christina Aguilera: Not Your Puppet|work=''[[MTV News]]''|publisher=[[Viacom]]|year=2002|accessdate=January 29, 2009}}</ref> She mentioned plans for her next album to have more musical and lyrical depth.<ref name="USAToday">{{cite news|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 24, 2002|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2002-10-23-christina-aguilera_x.htm|title=Aguilera's image is 'Stripped'|accessdate=July 3, 2009|first=Gardner|last=Elysa|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]}}</ref> By late 2000, Aguilera decided not to continue the contact with Kurtz.<ref name="USAToday"/> After terminating Kurtz's services, [[Irving Azoff]] was hired as her new manager.<ref name="USAToday"/> Following the managerial shakeup, Aguilera decided to create her new style of music on the following album. She also used her new [[alter ego]], "Xtina".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/christina_aguilera/0,,,00.html|title=Christina Aguilera: Five Fun Facts|work=People|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=May 25, 2013}}</ref> She also changed her public appearance and persona, with her hair dyed black and nude photographs on magazine covers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/474045/christina-aguileras-top-10-biggest-career-moments?page=0%2C2|title=Christina Aguilera's Top 10 Biggest Career Moments|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=November 21, 2012|accessdate=August 23, 2013|first=Jason|last=Lipshutz}}</ref>

Aguilera further commented about the event with ''[[USA Today]]'', "When you're part of a pop phenomenon, you have so many opinions shoved down your throat. People try to tell you what you should do, how you should act, what you should wear, who you should be with. At the time things started happening for me, it was popular to be the squeaky-clean, cookie-cutter pop singer. But that role didn't speak to me, because it's so boring and superficial".<ref name="USAToday"/> About the conception of ''Stripped'', Aguilera said to MTV News,<ref name="mtv.com"/>

<blockquote>I feel like it is a new beginning, a re-introduction of myself as a new artist in a way, because for the first time people are really seeing and getting to know how I really am. I got a chance to show of all these colors and textures of my love of music and of my vocal range. Coming off of the height of being a part of such a big pop-craze phenomenon, that imagery of that cookie-cutter sweetheart, without it being me, I just had to take it all down and get it away from me. And that is why I actually named the album Stripped, because it is about being emotionally stripped down and pretty bare to open my soul and heart.</blockquote>

===Recording===
In late 2000, Aguilera started to record her then-upcoming material.<ref name="USAToday"/> The recording sessions took place in studios around [[California]] and [[New York City]], including [[Electric Lady Studios]] in New York, [[The Enterprise Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]], [[Conway Recording Studios]], [[Record Plant Studios|The Record Plant]] and [[NRG Recording Studios]] in [[Hollywood]].<ref name="Notes"/> According to Aguilera, the recording sessions were much longer than she thought.<ref name="USAToday"/> She further explained that lots of thing came up during that time, including her first break-up with her first boyfriend Jorge Santos.<ref name="USAToday"/> Aguilera also believed that the lyrics of ''Stripped'' were so personal, and her vocals "represent a rawer, more bare-bones approach as well, with less of the ostentatious riffing that has miffed critics in the past".<ref name="USAToday"/> She stated, "I did the vocal gymnastics thing because it was fun. That's why I like blues, too, because you can experiment more with that side of your voice. But I thought the lyrics on this record are so personal, deep and good that I wanted to make them stand out more than what I could do with my voice technically".<ref name="USAToday"/> 

On her new album, entitled ''Stripped'', Aguilera enlisted a wide range of [[songwriters]] and [[music producers|producers]], notably [[Alicia Keys]], [[Scott Storch]], and [[Linda Perry]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite news|last=Reid |first=Shaheem |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1455399/aguilera-alicia-keys-team-up-on-track.jhtml |title=Christina Aguilera, Alicia Keys Party Up For 'Impossible'|work=''MTV News''|publisher=Viacom|date=June 25, 2002 |accessdate=March 24, 2011}}</ref><ref name="mtv.com">{{cite news|last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458433/christina-talks-stripped.jhtml |title=Christina Stands Up For The Ladies, Discusses Father's Abuse |work=''MTV News''|publisher=Viacom |date=October 31, 2002 |accessdate=March 24, 2011}}</ref> Perry was one of the biggest influences to Aguilera during the making of the album.<ref name="mtv.com"/> The singer stated, "She taught me that imperfections are good and should be kept because it comes from the heart.
