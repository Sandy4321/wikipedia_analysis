Dnipropetrovsk is the [[Capital (political)|administrative centre]] of the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]].

Within the Dnipropetrovsk Metropolitan area the population is about 1,004,000<ref>[[United Nations]] Department of Economic and Social Affairs, [http://esa.un.org/wup2009/unup/index.asp?panel=2 World Urbanization Prospects (2009 revision)], (United Nations, 2010), Table A.12.

A vital industrial centre of Ukraine, Dnipropetrovsk was one of the key centres of the [[Nuclear power|nuclear]], [[Arms industry|arms]], and [[Soviet space program|space]] industries of the [[Soviet Union]]. In particular, it is home to the [[Yuzhmash]], a major space and [[ballistic missile]] design bureau and manufacturer. Because of its military industry, Dnipropetrovsk was a [[closed city]]<ref>A [[closed city]] does not allow foreigners inside without official permission.</ref> until the 1990s.

Dnipropetrovsk is a powerhouse of Ukraine's business and politics as the native city for many country's top-importance figures. Ukraine's politics is still defined by the legacy of [[Leonid Kuchma]], [[Pavlo Lazarenko]] and [[Yuliya Tymoshenko]] whose intermingled careers started in Dnipropetrovsk.

==Nomenclature==

Over time, Dnipropetrovsk has been known by a number of names:

*Yekaterinoslav 1776<U+2013>1782, reestablished 1783<U+2013>1797
*Novorossiysk 1797<U+2013>1802
*Yekaterinoslav 1802<U+2013>1918
*Katerynoslav / Yekaterinoslav 1918<U+2013>1926
*Dnipropetrovsk / Dnepropetrovsk 1926<U+2013>1992
*Dnipropetrovsk 1992<U+2013>present

It is also referred to as ''Katerynoslav'', also ''Catharinoslav'' on maps of the nineteenth century.<ref>[http://www.arhivtime.ru/karta/karta_arhiv/image_arhiv/01/1820.jpg English map of 1820]</ref>

In some [[English language|Anglophone]] media the city was also known as the Rocket City.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Rock-Roll-Rocket-City-Dniepropetrovsk/dp/0801895502 Zhuk, S. ''Rock and Roll in the Rocket City: The West, Identity, and Ideology in Soviet Dniepropetrovsk, 1960-1985'']. "Woodrow Wilson Center Press with Johns Hopkins University Press". 2010</ref>

In 1918, the [[Central Council of Ukraine]] proposed to change the name of the city to ''Sicheslav''; however, it was never officially fulfilled.

==Geography==
[[File:Dniepropetrowsk z lotu ptaka.jpg|left|thumb|An aerial view of Dnipropetrovsk. The [[Dnieper River]], city's left and right banks, and a number of bridges can be seen.]]
The city is built mainly upon the both banks of the Dnieper, at its confluence with the [[Samara River (Dnieper)|Samara River]]. In the loop of a major meander, the Dnieper changes its course from the north west to continue southerly and later south-westerly through Ukraine, ultimately passing [[Kherson]], where it finally flows into the [[Black Sea]]. The city's location always provided significant opportunities for the advancement of agriculture, mainly due to the natural irrigation provided by the river and the resulting fertile soils. {{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The area the city is built on is mainly devoid of hills and other geographical features. Being mainly flat, the land is easy to use, which explains why the city has been able to grow to such a great extent over the past 200 years. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  Whilst most residential, commercial, and industrial districts of the city are along the less marshy south bank of the river, some residential, commercial, and industrial areas have developed on the previously less-hospitable northern bank. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Nowadays both the north and south banks play home to a range of industrial enterprises and manufacturing plants. The airport is located about {{convert|15|km|2|abbr=on}} south-easterly of the city.

The centre of the city is constructed on the right bank which is part of the [[Dnieper Upland]], while the left bank is part of the [[Dnieper Lowland]]. The old town is situated atop of a hill that is formed as a result of the river's change of course to the south. The change of river's direction is caused by its proximity to the [[Azov Upland]] located southeast of the city.

One of the city's streets, Prospekt Karla Marksa, links the two major architectural ensembles of the city and constitutes an important thoroughfare through the centre, which along with various suburban radial road systems, provides some of the area's most vital transport links for both suburban and inter-urban travel.

===Climate===

During the summer, Dnipropetrovsk is very warm (average day temperature in July is {{convert|24|to|28|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, even hot sometimes {{convert|32|to|36|C|F|0|abbr=on}}. Temperatures as high as {{convert|36|<U+00B0>C|0}} have been recorded in May. Winter is not so cold (average day temperature in January is {{convert|-4|to|0|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, but when there is no snow and the wind blows hard, it feels extremely cold. A mix of snow and rain happens usually in December.

The best time for visiting the city is in late spring <U+2014> late April and May, and early in autumn: September, October, when the city's trees turn yellow. Other times are mainly dry with a few showers.<ref>''See also:'' [http://www.klimadiagramme.de/Europa/dnepropetrovsk.html klimadiagramme.de] <U+2014> Climate in Dnipropetrovsk URL accessed on 20 March 2007</ref>

==History==

===Ancient times===

After the last [[Ice Age]] (10,000 years ago) the settling of the Prydniprovia area began more intensely.  In c.3500<U+2013>2700 BC the first farmers lived here (people of the so-called [[Cucuteni culture|Cucuteni-Trypillia culture]]). {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The [[Cimmerians]], ancient equestrian nomads who bred cattle, occupied the North Pontic steppe zone including Prydniprovye; their culture and civilization flourished between about 1000 and 800 BC. The [[Cimmerians]] were driven out by the nomadic [[Scythians]] (700 BC), who in turn were overcome by the [[Sarmatians]] from the East (200 BC). {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The mighty, broad [[Dnieper River]] (Greeks called it the [[Borysthenes]], 'Borysphen' in local pronunciation) with its picturesque islands and peaceful backwaters, lush flood-meadows and shadowy oak woods stretches along river valleys and ravines. Abundant game and fish in local forests and waters are a result of good climate and vast fertile land. All this attracted hunters, fishers, cattle-breeders and land-tillers to these parts. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In the 3rd and 4th century, about {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of the modern city, the village of [[Bashmachka]] ([[:uk:<U+0411><U+0430><U+0448><U+043C><U+0430><U+0447><U+043A><U+0430>|<U+0411><U+0430><U+0448><U+043C><U+0430><U+0447><U+043A><U+0430>]]) was one of the centres of the Goths. A little later their place was taken by first the Huns, the Avars, the Bulgars, and the Magyars. After them the Slavs began to settle in the area. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===The middle ages===
[[File:Polovtsy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Kipchaks|Kipchak]] statues near the Historical Museum, Karla Marksa Prospekt]]

A monastery was founded by [[Byzantine]] monks on [[Monastyrsky Island]], probably in the 9th century ([[870 AD]]).  The Dnipropetrovsk area was ruled by a steppe nomadic people called the [[Cumans]] or Kipchaks who ruled this area until the [[Mongol invasions]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}  The [[Tatar]]s destroyed the monastery in 1240.<ref name="dp">{{cite web|author=Tue, 12 March 201307:51 |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/eng/guide/?pageid=240 |title=Welcome to Dnipropetrovsk! <U+00BB> City Guide - Dnipropetrovsk |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>

At the beginning of the 15th century, [[Tatar]] tribes inhabiting the right bank of the Dnieper were driven away by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].  Unfortunately, by the mid-15th century, the [[Nogais|Nogai]] (who lived north of the [[Sea of Azov]]) and the [[Crimean Khanate]] invaded these lands. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crimean Khanate agreed to a border along the Dnieper, and further east along the [[Samara River]], i.e. through what is today the city of Dnipropetrovsk. It was in this time that there appeared a new force <U+2013> the free people <U+2013> [[Cossacks]]. They later became known as [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] (Zaporizhia <U+2013> the lands south of Prydniprovye, translate as "The Land Beyond the Weirs [Rapids]").  This was a period of raids and fighting causing considerable devastation and [[depopulation]] in that area; the area became known as [[Wild Fields|the 'Wilderness' (Russian <U+0414><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+0435> <U+043F><U+043E><U+043B><U+0435>)]] (Ukrainian [[:uk:<U+0414><U+0438><U+043A><U+0435> <U+041F><U+043E><U+043B><U+0435>|<U+0414><U+0438><U+043A><U+0435> <U+041F><U+043E><U+043B><U+0435>]]).

Under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] of 1654, the territory became part of the [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian Empire]]. For practical purposes, the Prydniprovye lands remained a self-governing border area until the destruction of the [[Zaporizhian Sich]] in 1775.

The Zaporozhian village of ''Polovytsia'' was founded in the late-1760s, between the settlements of Stari (Old) and Novi (New) Kodaky. It was located at the present centre of the city to the West to district of Central Terminal and the ''Ozyorka'' farmers market.<ref name = eugene/>

The city that is now called Dnipropetrovsk was founded as part of the expansion of the [[Russian Empire]] into the lands North of the [[Black Sea]], known as the [[Novorossiya|Novorossiysk gubernia]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} The city was originally known as ''Yekaterinoslav'', which translates in English to "The glory of Yekaterina" ([[Catherine the Great]]). It became the administrative centre of the [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]].

[[Cossacks|Cossack]] and Russian armies fought against the [[Ottoman Empire]] for control of this area in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768<U+2013>1774)]]. The [[Treaty of K<U+00FC><U+00E7><U+00FC>k Kaynarca]] ended this war in July 1774; and in May 1775 the Russian army destroyed the [[Zaporozhian Host|Zaporozhian Sich]], thus eliminating the political independence of Cossacks. In 1774 [[Grigori Aleksandrovich Potemkin|Prince Grigori Potemkin]] was appointed governor of Novorossiysk gubernia, and after the destruction of the Zaporozhian Sich, he started founding cities in the region and encouraging foreign settlers. The city of ''Yekaterinoslav'' was founded in 1776, not in the current location, but at the confluence of the [[Samara River (Dnieper)|River Samara]] with the River Kil'chen' at Loshakivka, north of the Dnieper. By 1782, the city population was 2,194. However the site had been badly chosen because spring waters were transforming the city into a bog.<ref name = eugene>[http://www.eugene.com.ua/dnepr.html www.eugene.com.ua Dnepropetrovsk History]</ref> The settlement was later renamed Novomoskovsk.<ref name="ReferenceA">S. S. Montefiore: Prince of Princes <U+2013> The Life of Potemkin</ref>
In 1783, ''Yekaterinoslav'' was refounded on its current site, on the south bank of the Dnieper, near the Zaporozhian village of ''Polovytsia''. The population of ''Yekaterinoslav-Kil'chen''' were (according to some sources) transferred to the new site. Potemkin's plans for the city were extremely ambitious. It was to be about {{convert|30|by|25|km|0|abbr=on}} in size, and included:<ref name = eugene/>

* [[Transfiguration Cathedral, Dnipropetrovsk|Transfiguration Cathedral]] (the claim that it was intended as the largest in the world probably results from confusing Potemkin's reference to San Paulo-fuori-le-mura in Rome with St Peter's Basilica.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>)
* The Potemkin palace
* A magnificent university (never built)
* A botanical garden on Monastyrskyi Island
* Wide straight avenues through the city.
[[File:Ekaterinoslav.jpg|thumb|left|Yekaterinoslav, Main Post Office]]
The site for the Potemkin palace was bought from retired Cossack yesaul (colonel) Lazar' Globa, who owned much of the land near the city. Part of Lazar' Globa's gardens still exist and are now called Globa Park.<ref name = eugene/>

A combination of Russian red tape, defective workmanship, and theft resulted in what was built being less than originally planned. Construction stopped after the death of Potemkin and his sponsor, Empress Catherine. Plans were reconsidered and scaled back. The size of the cathedral was reduced, and it was completed in 1835. From 1797 to 1802 the city was called ''Novorossiysk''.<ref name = eugene/><ref name=Abelyak>[http://lgi.osi.hu/ethnic/csdb/doc/Abelyak.doc Belyakov, Alexander, ''Processes of integration among ethnic and displaced Germans in Ukraine (a comparative analysis with integrative experience in Germany)]</ref>

Despite the bridging of the Dnieper in 1796 and the growth of trade in the early 19th century, ''Yekaterinoslav'' remained small until the 1880s, when the railway was built and industrialization of the city began.<ref name=ukrainetrek>[http://ukrainetrek.com/Dnepropetrovsk_city.shtml Ukrainetrek Dnepropetrovsk (City)]</ref> The boom was caused by two men:  [[John Hughes (businessman)|John Hughes]], a Welsh businessman who built an iron works at what is now [[Donetsk]] in 1869<U+2013>72, and developed the Donetsk coal deposits.;<ref name = eugene/> and Alexandr Pol', a Ukrainian who accidentally discovered the [[Kryvyi Rih]] iron ores in 1866, during archaeological research.<ref name = eugene/>

The Donetsk coal was necessary for smelting pig-iron from the Kryvyi Rih ore, producing a need for railway to connect Donetsk with Kryvyi Rih. Permission to build the railway was given in 1881, and it opened in 1884. The railway crossed the Dnieper at ''Yekaterinoslav''. The city grew quickly; new suburbs appeared: Amur, Nyzhnodniprovsk and the factory areas developed. In 1897, ''Yekaterinoslav'' became the third city in the Russian Empire to have electric trams. The Higher Mining School opened in 1899, and by 1913 it had grown into the Mining Institute.<ref name = eugene/>

Russian defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905 resulted in revolts against the Tsar in many places including ''Yekaterinoslav''. Tens of people were killed and hundreds wounded. There was a wave of anti-Semitic attacks.<ref name = eugene/>

From 1902 to 1933, the famous historian of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], [[Dmytro Yavornytsky]], was Director of the Dnipropetrovsk Museum, which was later named after him. Before his death in 1940, Yavornytsky wrote a ''History of the City of Yekaterinoslav'', which lay in manuscript for many years. It was only published in 1989 as a result of the [[perestroika|Gorbachev reforms]].

{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
After the Russian [[February revolution]] in 1917 Yekaterinoslav became a city within autonomy of [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] under [[Tsentralna Rada]] government. In November 1917 the [[Bolshevik]]s led a rebellion and got power for a short time. The city experienced occupation of German and Austrian-Hungarian armies that were allies of Ukrainian [[Hetman]] [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]] and helped him to keep authority in the country.

In the time of the Ukrainian [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] government, with its dictator [[Symon Petlura]], the city had periods of uncertain power. At times the [[anarchist]]s of [[Nestor Makhno]] held the city, and at others [[Anton Ivanovich Denikin|Denikin]]'s [[Volunteer Army]]. Military operations of the [[Red Army]], which came in from the North, captured the city in 1919, and despite attempts by Russian General [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|Wrangel]] in 1920, he was unable to reach Yekaterinoslav. The War ended the following year.

During the past century, the economic activity of the city has defined its [[political]] importance. Dnipropetrovsk and the surrounding [[oblast]] are the birthplace of the "Dnipropetrovsk Faction", an influential informal political group inside the [[CPSU]], members of which were the industrial and party elite.  [[Leonid Brezhnev]], a native of the nearby city of [[Dniprodzerzhyns'k]] and later the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party General Secretary]], assured members of this group of a prominent place in Soviet society and politics.

In December 1945, thousands of German [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] began construction and built the first sections and shops in the new factory.  This was the foundation of the Dnipropetrovsk Automobile Factory. In 1947 and 1948 this factory produced the first cars and special military [[automobile]]s. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In 1954 the administration of this automobile factory opened a secret design office with the name <U+201C>Southern<U+201D> (konstruktorskoe biuro Yuzhnoe <U+2013> in Russian) to construct military [[missile]]s and rocket engines. Hundreds of talented physicists, engineers and machine designers moved from Moscow and other large cities in the Soviet Union to Dnipropetrovsk to join this <U+201C>Southern<U+201D> design office. In 1965, the secret Plant #586 was transferred to the Ministry of General Machine-Building of the USSR. The next year this plant officially changed its name into <U+201C>the Southern Machine-building Factory<U+201D> (Yuzhnyi mashino-stroitel<U+2019>nyi zavod) or in abbreviated Russian, simply [[Yuzhmash]]. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The first <U+201C>General Constructor<U+201D> and head of the <U+201C>Southern<U+201D> design office was [[Mikhail Yangel]], a prominent scientist and outstanding designer of space rockets, who managed not only the design office, but the entire factory from 1954 to 1971. Yangel designed the first powerful rockets and space military equipment for the [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Soviet Ministry of Defense]]. Moscow sent specialists and invested money into Yangel and his colleagues<U+2019> projects. Yangel collaborated with talented engineers who later became the leaders of military production in Dnipropetrovsk and the official directors of Yuzhmash. Two close collaborators of Yangel and of his successor V. Utkin (1971<U+2013>1990) were the Yuzhmash directors [[Leonid Smirnov (politician)|Leonid Smirnov]] (1952<U+2013>1961) and Aleksandr Makarov (1961<U+2013>1986). {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In 1951 the Southern Machine-building Factory began manufacturing and testing new military rockets for the battlefield. The range of these first missiles was only {{convert|270|km|0|abbr=off}}. By 1959 Soviet scientists and engineers developed new technology, and as a result, the <U+201C>Southern<U+201D> design office (KBYu <U+2013> as abbreviated in Russian) started a new machine-building project making [[ballistic missile]]s. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Under the leadership of Yangel, KBYu produced such powerful rocket engines that the range of these ballistic missiles was practically without limits. During the 1960s, these powerful rocket engines were used as launch vehicles for the first Soviet space ships. During Makarov<U+2019>s directorship, Yuzhmash designed and manufactured four generations of missile complexes of different types. These included space launch vehicles [[Kosmos (rocket family)|Kosmos]], [[Tsyklon-2]], [[Tsyklon-3]] and [[Zenit (rocket family)|Zenit]]. Under the leadership of Yangel<U+2019>s successor, V. Utkin, the KBYu created a unique space-rocket system called Energia-Buran. Yuzhmash engineers manufactured 400 technical devices that were launched in artificial satellites ([[Sputnik]]s). For the first time in the world space industry, the Dnipropetrovsk missile plant organised the serial production of space Sputniks. By the 1980s, this plant manufactured 67 different types of space ships, 12 space research complexes and 4 defense space rocket systems. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

These systems were used not only for purely military purposes by the Ministry of Defense, but also for astronomic research, for global radio and television network and for ecological monitoring. Yuzhmash initiated and sponsored the international space program of socialist countries, called [[Interkosmos]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

On the eve of the collapse of the Soviet Union, KBYu had 9 regular and corresponding members of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]], 33 full professors and 290 scientists holding a Ph.D. They awarded scientific degrees and presided over a prestigious graduate school at KBYu, which attracted talented students of physics from all over the USSR. More than 50,000 people worked at Yuzhmash. At the end of the 1950s, Yuzhmash became the main Soviet design and manufacturing centre for different types of missile complexes. The Soviet Ministry of Defense included Yuzhmash in its strategic plans. The military rocket systems manufactured in Dnipropetrovsk became the major component of the newly born Soviet Missile Forces of Strategic Purpose. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

According to contemporaries, Yuzhmash was separate entity inside the Soviet state. After a long period of competition with the Moscow centre of rocket construction of V. Chelomei (a successor of Koroliov) Yuzhmash rocket designs won in 1969. Since that time leaders of the Soviet military industrial complex preferred Yuzhmash rocket models. By the end of the 1970s, this plant became the major centre for designing, constructing, manufacturing, testing and deploying strategic and space missile complexes in the Soviet Union. The general designer and director of Yuzhmash supervised the work of numerous research institutes, design centres and factories all over the Soviet Union from Moscow, [[Leningrad]] and [[Kiev]], to [[Voronezh]] and [[Yerevan]]. The Soviet state provided billions of Soviet [[ruble]]s to finance Yuzhmash projects.

Officially, Yuzhmash manufactured agricultural tractors and special kitchen equipment for everyday needs, such as mincing-machines or juicers for peaceful Soviet households. In official reports for the general audience there was no information about the production of rockets or spaceships. However, hundreds of thousands of workers and engineers in the city of Dnipropetrovsk worked in this plant and members of their families (up to 60% of the city population!) knew about the <U+201C>real production<U+201D> of Yuzhmash.  This missile plant became a significant factor in the arms race of the Cold War.  This is why the Soviet government approved of the KGB<U+2019>s secrecy about Yuzhmash and its products. According to the Soviet government<U+2019>s decision, the city of Dnipropetrovsk was officially closed to foreign visitors in 1959. No citizen of a foreign country (even of the socialist ones) was allowed to visit the city or district of Dnipropetrovsk. After the late 1950s ordinary Soviet people called Dnipropetrovsk <U+201C>the rocket closed city.<U+201D>

Only during [[perestroika]] was Dnipropetrovsk opened to foreigners again in 1987. (see in detail in Sergei I. Zhuk, Rock and Roll in the Rocket City: The West, Identity, and Ideology in Soviet Dniepropetrovsk, 1960-1985 (Baltimore, MD: the Johns Hopkins University Press & Washington, D.C.: Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 2010), 18-28.

Journeys from Kryviy Rih took up to six hours in special railway carriages with grated windows.  Some prisoners had to do this 14 or 15 times.  After complaints by the ombudsman (Nina Karpacheva) the head of the State prison department of Ukraine (Vladimir Levochkin) arranged that finances were given for the provision of women cells in Dnipropetrovsk Preliminary Prison, making the lives of the 15,000 unconvicted women-detainees easier from August 2000.<ref>[http://www.khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1085176391 ''Kievskie vedomosti'', 14 August 2000.]</ref>

Dnipropetrovsk is a primarily industrial city of around one million people; in being such it has developed into a large urban centre over the past few centuries to become, today, Ukraine's third-largest city.

[[File:Sviato-Preobrazhenskyi Cathedral.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The Transfiguration Cathedral was one of the first structures built in Dnipropetrovsk.]]
Immediately after its foundation Dnipropetrovsk, or as it was then known Yekaterinoslav, began to develop exclusively on the right bank of the Dnieper River. At first the city developed radially from the central point provided by the Transfiguration Cathedral. Neo-classical structures of brick and stone construction were preferred and the city began to take on the appearance of a typical European city of the era. Of these buildings many have been retained in the city's older Zhovtnevy Raion (district).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=52 |title=<U+0418><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+044F> <U+0414><U+043D><U+0435><U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+043F><U+0435><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430> <U+0438> <U+041F><U+0440><U+0438><U+0434><U+043D><U+0435><U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+044C><U+044F> |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref> Amongst the most important buildings of this era are the Transfiguration Cathedral, and a number of buildings in the area surrounding Karla Marksa Prospekt.

Over the next few decades, until the October Revolution in 1917 the city did not change much in appearance and the predominant architectural style remained that of neo-classicism. Notable buildings built in the era preceding the Bolshevik's rise to power and the establishment of communist Ukraine and later its absorption into the [[Soviet Union]], include the main building of the [[National Mining University of Ukraine|National Mining University]], which was built in 1899-1901,<ref>{{cite web|author=<U+0412><U+0442>, 12 <U+043C><U+0430><U+0440><U+0442><U+0430> 201307:51 |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/out/attractions/oneplace/?place_id=932 |title=<U+041D><U+0430><U+0446><U+0438><U+043E><U+043D><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+0413><U+043E><U+0440><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+0423><U+043D><U+0438><U+0432><U+0435><U+0440><U+0441><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435><U+0442> - <U+0414><U+043D><U+0435><U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+043F><U+0435><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A> |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref> the art-nouveau inspired building of the city's former Duma,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dneprotur.ucoz.com/photo/retrophotos/old_dnepropetrovsk/city_council/27-0-46 |title=<U+0413><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+0434><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430><U+044F> <U+0414><U+0443><U+043C><U+0430> - <U+0421><U+0442><U+0430><U+0440><U+044B><U+0439> <U+0414><U+043D><U+0435><U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+043F><U+0435><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A> - <U+0420><U+0435><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0444><U+043E><U+0442><U+043E> - <U+0424><U+043E><U+0442><U+043E><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+0431><U+043E><U+043C><U+044B> - <U+041F><U+0430><U+043C><U+044F><U+0442><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+0438>, <U+0430><U+0440><U+0445><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435><U+043A><U+0442><U+0443><U+0440><U+0430>, <U+0438><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+044F>, <U+0442><U+0443><U+0440><U+0438><U+0437><U+043C> |publisher=Dneprotur.ucoz.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref> the Dnipropetrovsk National Historical Museum, and the Mechnikov Regional Hospital.

Once the bolsheviks had taken power in Dnipropetrovsk the city was gradually purged of tsarist-era monuments and monumental architecture was stripped of Imperial coats of arms and other non-socialist symbolism.

After the death of Stalin and appointment of [[Khrushchev]], a Ukrainian, as party secretary, the industrialisation of Dnipropetrovsk became even more profound, with the Southern (Yuzhne) Missile and Rocket factory being set up in the city. However, this was not the only development and many other factories, especially metallurgical and heavy-manufacturing plants, were set up in the city.<ref name=gorod.dp.ua-68>{{cite web|url=http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=68 |title=<U+0418><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+044F> <U+0414><U+043D><U+0435><U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+043F><U+0435><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430> <U+0438> <U+041F><U+0440><U+0438><U+0434><U+043D><U+0435><U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+044C><U+044F> |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref> At this point Dnipropetrovsk became one of the most important manufacturing cities in the Soviet Union, producing many goods from small articles like screws and vacuum cleaners to aircraft engine pieces and ballistic missiles. As a result of all this industrialisation the city's inner suburbs became increasingly polluted and were gradually given over to large, unsightly industrial enterprises. At the same time the estensive development of the city's left bank and western suburbs as new residential areas began.<ref name=gorod.dp.ua-68/> The low-rise tenant houses of the Khrushchev era ([[Khrushchyovka]]s) gave way to the construction of high-rise prefabricated apartment blocks (similar to German [[Plattenbau]]s). In 1976 in line with the city's 1926 renaming a large monumental statue of [[Grigoriy Petrovsky]] was placed on the square in front of the city's station.<ref>[http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=67] <U+0412> 1976 <U+0433>. <U+0430><U+0440><U+0445><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435><U+043A><U+0442><U+0443><U+0440><U+043D><U+043E>-<U+0445><U+0443><U+0434><U+043E><U+0436><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+0430><U+044F> <U+043A><U+043E><U+043C><U+043F><U+043E><U+0437><U+0438><U+0446><U+0438><U+044F> <U+043F><U+0440><U+0438><U+0432><U+043E><U+043A><U+0437><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+043D><U+043E><U+0439> <U+043F><U+043B><U+043E><U+0449><U+0430><U+0434><U+0438> <U+0431><U+044B><U+043B><U+0430> <U+0437><U+0430><U+0432><U+0435><U+0440><U+0448><U+0435><U+043D><U+0430> <U+043F><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+043A><U+043E><U+0439> <U+043F><U+0430><U+043C><U+044F><U+0442><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+0430> <U+0413>. <U+0418>. <U+041F><U+0435><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+043C><U+0443></ref>

To this day the city is characterised by its mix of architectural styles, with much of the city's centre consisting of pre-revolutionary buildings in a variety of styles, stalinist buildings and constructivist architecture, whilst residential districts are, more often than not, made up of aesthetically simple, technically outdated mid-rise and high-rise housing stock from the Soviet era. Despite this, the city does have a large number of 'private sectors' were the tradition of building and maintaining individual detached housing has continued to this day. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Since the independence of Ukraine in 1991 and the economic development that followed, a number of large commercial and business centres have been built in the city's outskirts.

=== Attractions===
[[File:Taras Shevchenko Park (Entrance).jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to the [[Taras Shevchenko]] Park in Dnipropetrovsk.]]
The city has a variety of theatres (plus an Opera) and museums of interest to tourists. There are also several parks, restaurants and beaches.

The major streets of the city were renamed in honour of Marxist heroes during the Soviet era. The central thoroughfare is known as Karla Marksa Prospekt, a, wide and long boulevard that stretches east to west through the centre of the city. It was founded in the 18th century and parts of its buildings are the actual decoration of the city. In the heart of the city is ''Zhovtneva'' [October] Square, which includes the majestic cathedral founded by order of [[Catherine the Great]] in 1787. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

On the square, there are some remarkable buildings: the Museum of History, Diorama "Battle for the Dnieper River ([[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]])", and also the  park in which one can rest in the hot summer. Walking down the hill to the [[Dnieper River]], one arrives in the large [[Taras Shevchenko]] Park (which is on the right bank of the river) and on [[Monastyrsky Island]]. This island is one of the most interesting places in the city. In the 9th century, the Byzantine monks based a monastery here. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

A few areas retain their historical character: all of Central Avenue, some street-blocks on the main hill (the Nagorna part) between Pushkin Prospekt and Embankment, and sections near Globa (formerly known as [[Chkalov]] park until it was recently renamed) and Shevchenko parks have been untouched for 150 years. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The Dnieper River keeps the climate mild. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} It is visible from many points in Dnipropetrovsk. From any of the three hills in the city, one can see a  view of the river, islands, parks, outskirts, river banks and other hills.

There was no need to build skyscrapers in the city in Soviet times. The major industries preferred to locate their offices close to their factories and away from the centre of town. Most new office buildings are built in the same architectural style as the old buildings. A number, however, display more modern aesthetics, and some blend the two styles.

===Sport===
[[File:Dnipro Arena.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Dnipro Arena]] in Dnipropetrovsk]]
The city also houses the [[Ukrainian Premier League]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club, [[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]]. This club, commonly seen as representing the city at large, holds a record for being the only Soviet team to win the USSR Federation Cup twice; since independence they have gone on to win the [[Ukrainian Championship]] once and the Ukrainian League Cup three times. Despite Dnipro's dominance, a number of other teams also call Dnipropetrovsk their home, these include, amongst others, FC Lokomotyv Dnipropetrovsk and FC Spartak Dnipropetrovsk, both of which have large fan bases in the city. On a national/international stage however, no team from the city has met with the same level of success experienced by FC Dnipro.

Recently the city built a new soccer stadium; the [[Dnipro Arena]] has a capacity of 31,003 people and was built as a replacement for Dnipro's old stadium, [[Stadium Meteor]]. The [[Dnipro Arena]] hosted the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] qualification game between [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[England national football team|England]] on 10 October 2009.The Dnipro Arena was initially chosen as one of the Ukrainian venues for their joint Euro 2012 bid with Poland. However it was dropped from the list in May 2009 as the capacity fell short of the minimum 33,000 seats required by [[UEFA]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/feedarticle/8499613 Kiev and Donetsk likely for Euro 2012, others uncertain]</ref><ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5it8f_MOzCKu2hxVHUUXwOvzetMIw UEFA names four Polish Euro 2012 host cities, one in Ukraine]</ref>

[[File:NGU Dnepropetrovsk.jpg|right|thumb|The National Mining University, one of the city's oldest higher educational institutions, is housed in a large neo-classical building located on Karla Marksa Prospekt.]]
Dnipropetrovsk is a major educational centre in Ukraine and is home to two of Ukraine's top-ten universities; the [[Dnipropetrovsk National University]] and [[National Mining University of Ukraine|National Mining University]].

In 2003 158 schools of all varieties were registered as operating in Dnipropetrovsk. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}} As was later recorded in 2010, around 80,000 pupils between the ages of six and nineteen study in schools in the city (of which there were, by 1 September 2010, 164). Of this figure almost 9,000 pupils were in their first year of compulsory education.

Currently the city has 173 kindergartens, 39 of which are within educational establishments, and in which around 30 000 children are educated. There are also 5 orphanages in the city, and in 1992 the first judicial lyceum in Ukraine was founded in Dnipropetrovsk.

In 2006 Dnipropetrovsk hosted the All-Ukrainian Olympiad in Information Technology; in 2008, that for Mathematics, and in 2009 the semi-final of the All-Ukrainian Olympiad in Programming for the Eastern Region. In the same year as the latter took place, the youth group 'Eksperiment', an organisation promoting increased cultural awareness amongst Ukrainians, was founded in the city.

=== Higher education ===
Dnipropetrovsk currently has 14 state-run higher educational institutions, and a large number of private institutions.

==Transportation==

=== Local transportation===
[[File:Dnepropetrovsk 0173s.JPG|thumb|left|Marshall [[Rodion Malinovsky|Malinovsky]] Street on the left bank of the Dnieper looking west. The arch is part of the railway [[Merefa]]-[[Kherson]] bridge, which crosses [[Monastyrsky Island]].]]

The main forms of public transport used in Dnipropetrovsk are trams, buses, electric [[trolley bus]]es and [[marshrutka]]s<U+2014>private [[minibuses]]. In addition to this there are a large number of taxi firms operating in the city, and many residents have private cars.

The city's municipal roads also suffer from the same funding problems as the trams, with many of them in a very poor technical state. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}} It is not uncommon to find very large potholes and crumbling surfaces on many of Dnipropetrovsk's smaller roads. Major roads and highways are of better quality. In recent years the situation has, however, been improving, with a number of new used trams bought from the German cities of Dresden and Magdeburg,<ref>{{cite web|author=<U+0432><U+0442>, 12 <U+043C><U+0430><U+0440><U+0442><U+0430> 201307:52 |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/news/60242 |title=<U+041A> <U+043D><U+0430><U+043C> <U+043F><U+0440><U+0438><U+0432><U+0435><U+0437><U+043B><U+0438> <U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+044B><U+0435> <U+0441><U+0442><U+0430><U+0440><U+044B><U+0435> <U+0442><U+0440><U+0430><U+043C><U+0432><U+0430><U+0438> - <U+0414><U+043D><U+0435><U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+043F><U+0435><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A> |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |date=2011-01-19 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref> and a number of roads, including Schmidt Street and Moskovsky Street being reconstructed with modern road-building techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://34.ua/news/economic/transport/roads/85-remont-dorog-v-dnepropetrovske-na-16-avgusta-2011-goda.html |title=<U+0420><U+0435><U+043C><U+043E><U+043D><U+0442> <U+0434><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+0433> <U+0432> <U+0414><U+043D><U+0435><U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+043F><U+0435><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+0435> <U+043D><U+0430> 16 <U+0430><U+0432><U+0433><U+0443><U+0441><U+0442><U+0430> 2011 <U+0433><U+043E><U+0434><U+0430> |publisher=34.ua |date=2011-08-15 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>

[[File:Map of Dnipropetrovsk Metro.png|thumb|225px|A scheme of the [[Dnipropetrovsk Metro]] system in the city.]]
Dnipropetrovsk also has a [[Dnipropetrovsk Metro|metro system]], opened in 1995, which consists of one line and 6 stations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/metro/eng/|title=Metro|accessdate=25 March 2008}}</ref> Work on other stations was abandoned when the city ran out of money for this project; two of these abandoned building works are in the central portion of Karla Marksa Prospekt. Completion of the next two stations is necessary to make the municipal subway system profitable. At the present time the completion date is unknown. As of 2011 the central portion of the city's metro line has seen renewed construction efforts and the metro has been transferred to municipal ownership in the hope that this will help it secure a loan from the European Bank for Development and Reconstruction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/115437/ |title=Dnipropetrovsk Metropoliten in municipal ownership now |publisher=Kyivpost.com |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref> <U+00A0>Current plans envision the three station section from Teatralna, through Tsentralna, to Muzeina completed by 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mignews.com.ua/ru/articles/90597.html |title=<U+041C><U+0435><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E> <U+0432> <U+0414><U+043D><U+0435><U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+043F><U+0435><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+0435> <U+0434><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+044F><U+0442> <U+0432> 2015 <U+0433><U+043E><U+0434><U+0443> - <U+0414><U+043D><U+0435><U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+043F><U+0435><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A> |publisher=MIGnews.com.ua |date=2011-10-25 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>

===Suburban transportation===
[[File:Central bridge Dnipropetrovsk from GOROD.DP.UA .jpg|thumb|left|Bridges linking the city's right and left banks are heavily used.]]
Dnipropetrovsk has some highways crossing through the city. The most popular routes are from [[Kiev]], [[Donetsk]], [[Kharkiv]] and [[Zaporizhia]]. Transit through the city is also available. As of 2011 the city is also seeing construction of a southern urban bypass, which will allow automobile traffic to proceed around the city centre. This is expected to both improve air quality and reduce transport issues from heavy freight lorries that pass through the city centre. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The largest bus station in eastern Ukraine is located in Dnipropetrovsk, from where bus routes are available to all over the country, including some international routes to [[Russia]], [[Poland]], [[Germany]], [[Moldova]] and [[Turkey]]. It is located near the city's central railway station.

In the summertime, there are some routes available by [[hydrofoil]]s on the [[Dnieper River]], whilst various tourist ships on their way down the river, (Kiev<U+2013>Kherson<U+2013>Odessa) tend to make a stop in the city. Dnipropetrovsk's river port is located close to the area surrounding the central railway station, on the banks of the river. It is a good example of constructivist architecture from the late period of the Soviet Union. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Railways===
The city is a large railway junction, with many daily trains running to and from [[Eastern Europe]] and on domestic routes within Ukraine. There are two railway terminals, "Dnipropetrovsk Glavnij" (main station)and "Dnipropetrovsk Yuzhnyi" (south station).

Two express passenger services run each day between [[Kiev]] and Dnipropetrovsk under the name 'Capital Express'. Other daytime services include suburban trains to towns and villages in the surrounding [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]]. Most long-distance trains tend to run at night to reduce the amount of daytime hours spent travelling by each passenger.

Domestic connections exist between Dnipropetrovsk and [[Kiev]], [[Lviv]], [[Simferopol]], [[Odessa]], [[Ivano-Frankivsk]], [[Truskavets]], [[Donetsk]], [[Kharkiv]] and many other smaller Ukrainian cities, whilst international destinations include, amongst others, [[Minsk]] in Belarus, [[Moscow]]'s [[Kursky Rail Terminal|Kursky Station]] and [[Saint Petersburg]]'s [[Vitebsky Rail Terminal|Vitebsky Station]] in Russia, [[Baku]] - the capital of Azerbaijan, and the Bulgarian seaside resort of [[Varna]].

===Air travel===
The city is served by an [[Dnipropetrovsk International Airport]] {{airport codes|DNK}} and is connected to European and Middle Eastern cities with daily flights.
