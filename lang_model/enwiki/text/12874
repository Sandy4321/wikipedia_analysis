[[File:Covent Garden Opera House.jpg|thumbnail|The Royal Opera House, home of the Royal Opera]]
'''The Royal Opera''' is an opera company based in central London, resident at the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]]. Along with the [[English National Opera]], it is one of the two principal opera companies in London. Founded in 1946 as the Covent Garden Opera Company, it was known by that title until 1968. Since its inception it has shared the Royal Opera House with the dance company now known as the [[Royal Ballet]].

When the company was formed its policy was to perform all works in English, but since the late 1950s most operas have been given in the original language. From the outset the company has comprised a mixture of British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] singers and international guest stars; fostering the careers of performers from within the company was a consistent policy of the early years. Among the many guest performers have been [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]], [[Hans Hotter]], [[Kirsten Flagstad]], [[Birgit Nilsson]], [[Maria Callas]], [[Pl<U+00E1>cido Domingo]] and [[Luciano Pavarotti]]. Among those who have risen to international prominence from the ranks of the company are [[Joan Sutherland]], [[Geraint Evans]], [[Kiri Te Kanawa]] and [[Jon Vickers]]. 

The company's growth under the management of [[David Webster (opera manager)|David Webster]] from modest beginnings to parity with the greatest opera houses was recognised by the grant of the title the Royal Opera in 1968. Under Webster's successor, [[John Tooley]], the Royal Opera prospered, but after his retirement in 1988, there followed a period of instability and the closure of the Royal Opera House for rebuilding and restoration between 1997 and 1999. In the 21st century stability was regained. The company has had six music directors since its inception, [[Karl Rankl]], [[Rafael Kubelik]], [[Georg Solti]], [[Colin Davis]], [[Bernard Haitink]] and [[Antonio Pappano]].

==History==
===Background===
{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FDF0F0 |salign=right| quote =  Between the two World Wars the provision of opera in Great Britain was variable in quality and quantity. At Covent Garden annual international seasons were organised ''ad hoc''. English seasons were even less regular, and poorly supported by the public. ... The Grand Season was largely a social occasion and in practice tended not to include British artists. Artistic achievement was always limited by the paucity of rehearsals that could be called for visiting stars.| source = Lords [[Arnold Goodman, Baron Goodman|Goodman]] and [[George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood|Harewood]]<br>''Report on Opera and Ballet in the United Kingdom'', 1969 <ref>Goodman and Harewood, p. 9</ref>|align=right| width=33%}}
Before the Second World War, various syndicates or individual [[impresario]]s had presented short seasons of opera at Covent Garden, sung in the original language, with star singers and conductors. Pre-war opera was described by the historian Montague Haltrecht as "international, dressy and exclusive".<ref>Haltrecht, p.18</ref> During the war, the Royal Opera House was leased by its owners, Covent Garden Properties Ltd, to [[Mecca Leisure Group|Mecca Ballrooms]] who used it profitably as a dance hall.<ref>Haltrecht, p. 51</ref> Towards the end of the war, the owners approached the music publishers [[Boosey & Hawkes|Boosey and Hawkes]] to see if they were interested in taking a lease of the building and staging opera (and ballet) once more. Boosey and Hawkes took a lease, and granted a sub-lease at generous terms to a not-for-profit charitable trust established to run the operation.<ref>Haltrecht, pp. 52 and 58</ref> The chairman of the trust was [[John Maynard Keynes|Lord Keynes]].{{#tag:ref|The other members were [[Kenneth Clark|Sir Kenneth Clark]], [[Stanley Marchant|Sir Stanley Marchant]], [[William Walton]] and, from Boosey and Hawkes, Leslie Boosey and Ralph Hawkes.<ref>"Covent Garden Opera and Ballet", ''The Times'', 20 July 1944, p. 6</ref><ref>Haltrecht, p. 57</ref>|group= n}}

There was some pressure for a return to the pre-war regime of starry international seasons.<ref>Haltrech, p. 52</ref> [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]], who had presented many Covent Garden seasons between 1910 and 1939 confidently expected to do so again after the war.<ref>Jefferson, 190<U+2013>192</ref> However, Boosey and Hawkes, and [[David Webster (opera manager)|David Webster]], whom they appointed as chief executive of the Covent Garden company,{{#tag:ref|Webster used the job title "general administrator" throughout his tenure at Covent Garden.<ref>Haltrecht, p. 307</ref>|group= n}} were committed to presenting opera all year round, in English with a resident company.<ref name=t46>"Opera in English <U+2013> A New Policy for Covent Garden <U+2013> Mr. Rankl Appointed Musical Director", ''The Times'', 17 June 1946, p. 8</ref><ref name=h54>Haltrecht, pp. 54<U+2013>56</ref> It was widely assumed that this aim would be met by inviting the existing [[English National Opera|Sadler's Wells Opera Company]] to become resident at the Royal Opera House.<ref name=h54/> Webster successfully extended just such an invitation to the [[Royal Ballet|Sadler's Wells Ballet Company]], but he regarded the sister opera company as "parochial".<ref>Haltrecht, p. 58</ref> He was determined to set up a new opera company of his own.<ref name=h54/> The British government had recently begun to give funds to subsidise the arts, and Webster negotiated an ''ad hoc'' grant of <U+00A3>60,000 and an annual subsidy of <U+00A3>25,000, enabling him to proceed.<ref>Haltrecht, p. 64</ref>

===Beginnings===
Webster's first priority was to appoint a musical director to build the company from scratch. He negotiated with [[Bruno Walter]] and [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goossens]], but neither of those conductors was willing to consider an opera company with no leading international stars.<ref>Haltrecht, p. 78</ref> Webster appointed a little-known Austrian, [[Karl Rankl]], to the post.<ref>Haltrecht, p. 79</ref> Before the war, Rankl had acquired considerable experience in charge of opera companies in Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia.<ref>Howes, Frank. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/22889 "Rankl, Karl,"] ''Grove Music Online'' Oxford Music Online, accessed 26 August 2011 {{subscription}}</ref> He accepted Webster's invitation to assemble and train the principals and chorus of a new opera company as well as a permanent orchestra to play for both the opera and the ballet.<ref name=t46/>

The new company made its debut in a joint presentation, together with the Sadler's Wells Ballet Company, of [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]'s ''[[The Fairy Queen]]'' on 31 July 1946.<ref>"Royal Opera House <U+2013> The Fairy Queen", ''The Times'', 1 August 1951, p. 8</ref> The first production by the opera company alone was ''[[Carmen]]'', on 14 January 1947.

All the members of the cast for the production were from Britain or the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].{{#tag:ref|The principals were [[Edith Coates]] as Carmen, with [[Kenneth Neate]], [[Dennis Noble]], Muriel Rae, [[David Franklin (broadcaster)|David Franklin]], [[Grahame Clifford]], Audrey Bowman and [[Constance Shacklock]].<ref name=carmen/>|group= n}} Later in the season, one of England's few pre-war international opera stars, [[Eva Turner]], appeared as [[Turandot]].<ref>"The Royal Opera <U+2013> Turandot", ''The Times'', 30 May 1947, p. 6</ref> For the company's second season, eminent  singers from continental Europe were recruited, including [[Ljuba Welitsch]], [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]], [[Paolo Silveri]], [[Rudolf Schock]] and [[Set Svanholm]].<ref>"Covent Garden Opera", ''The Times'', 7 September 1948, p. 6</ref> Other international stars who were willing to re-learn their roles in English for the company in its early years included [[Kirsten Flagstad]] and [[Hans Hotter]] for ''[[Die Walk<U+00FC>re|The Valkyrie]]''.<ref>"'The Valkyrie' in English", ''The Times'', 3 March 1948, p. 8</ref> Nevertheless, even as early as 1948, the opera in English policy was weakening; the company was obliged to present some Wagner performances in German to recruit leading exponents of the main roles.<ref>"Opera in English <U+2013> Long-Term Policy", ''The Times'', 3 December 1948, p. 7</ref> At first Rankl conducted all the productions; he was dismayed when eminent guest conductors including Beecham, [[Clemens Krauss]] and [[Erich Kleiber]] were later invited for prestige productions,{{#tag:ref| Rankl was resistant to allowing any outsiders to conduct his company, although he allocated performances of works he did not like to his staff conductors, [[Peter Gellhorn]] and [[Reginald Goodall]].<ref>Gilbert and Shir, p.74</ref>|group= n}} and by 1951 Rankl felt that he was no longer valued, and announced his resignation.<ref>Haltrecht, p. 150</ref> In Haltrecht's view, the company built up from nothing by Rankl had outgrown him.<ref>Haltrecht, p. 152</ref>

In the early years, the company sought to be innovative and widely accessible. Ticket prices were kept down: in the 1949 season 530 seats were available for each performance at [[Half crown (British coin)|half a crown]] (12<U+00BD> pence in decimal terms; <U+00A3>3.29 in terms of 2009 retail prices).<ref>{{cite web|last=Williamson |first=Samuel H. |title=Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1830 to Present|url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/ |publisher=MeasuringWorth |year=2009}}</ref> In addition to the standard operatic repertory, the company pioneered works by modern British composers such as [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], [[Arthur Bliss|Bliss]], and, later, [[William Walton|Walton]]. The young stage director [[Peter Brook]] was put in charge of productions, bringing a fresh and sometimes controversial approach to stagings.<ref name=sutcliffe>Sutcliffe, Tom.

===1950s===
After Rankl's departure the company engaged a series of guest conductors while Webster sought a new musical director. His preferred candidates, Kleiber, [[John Barbirolli]], [[Josef Krips]], Britten and [[Rudolf Kempe]], were among the guests but none would take the permanent post.<ref>Haltrecht, pp. 185<U+2013>190</ref> It was not until 1954 that Webster found a replacement for Rankl in [[Rafael Kubelik]].<ref>Haltrecht, p. 191</ref> Kubelik announced immediately that he was in favour of continuing the policy of singing in the vernacular: "Everything that the composer has written should be understood by the audience; and that is not possible if the opera is sung in a language with which they are not familiar".{{#tag:ref|Kubelik added that some operas are untranslatable, notably those of Wagner.<ref>"Mr. Kubelik on Opera at Covent Garden", ''The Times'', 30 September 1955, p. 3</ref>|group= n}} This provoked a public onslaught by Beecham, who continued to maintain that it was impossible to produce more than a handful of English-speaking opera stars, and that importing singers from continental Europe was the only way to achieve first-rate results.<ref>Beecham, Sir Thomas.

Despite Beecham's views, by the mid-1950s the Covent Garden company included many British and Commonwealth singers who were already or were soon to be much sought after by overseas opera houses.<ref name=temp>Temperley.

This meant that, while continuing to develop the British artists, it was felt impossible to reach the highest international level by using only British artists or singing only in English".<ref>Goodman and Harewood, p. 10</ref> Guest singers from mainland Europe in the 1950s included [[Maria Callas]], [[Boris Christoff]], [[Victoria de los <U+00C1>ngeles]], [[Tito Gobbi]] and [[Birgit Nilsson]].<ref>Drogheda et al, p. 143 (Callas), Haltrecht, pp. 134<U+2013>135 (Christoff), "The Royal Opera <U+2013> 'Manon'", ''The Times'', 6 December 1950, p. 8 (de los <U+00C1>ngeles), Haltrecht, pp.  281<U+2013>282 (Gobbi) and p. 227(Nilsson)</ref>

The verdict of the public on whether operas should be given in translation or the original was clear. In 1959, the opera house stated in its annual report, "[T]he percentage attendance at all opera in English was 72 per cent; attendance at the special productions marked by higher prices was 91 per cent <U+2026> it is 'international' productions with highly priced seats that reduce our losses".<ref>"Covent Garden States the Case for its Present Operatic Policy", ''The Times'', 9 December 1959, p. 4</ref> The opera in English policy was never formally renounced. On this subject, [[Peter Heyworth]] wrote in ''[[The Observer]]'' in 1960 that Covent Garden had "quickly learned the secret that underlies the genius of British institutions for undisturbed change: it continued to pay lip service to a policy that it increasingly ignored".<ref>Heyworth, Peter. "The State of Covent Garden", ''The Observer'', 24 July 1960, p. 25</ref>

By the end of the 1950s, Covent Garden was generally regarded as approaching the excellence of the world's greatest opera companies.<ref name=h237>Haltrecht, p. 237</ref> Its sister ballet company had achieved international recognition and was granted a royal charter in 1956, changing its title to "the Royal Ballet"; the opera company was close to reaching similar eminence.<ref name=h237/> Two landmark productions greatly enhanced its reputation. In 1957, Covent Garden presented the first substantially complete professional staging at any opera house of [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s vast opera ''[[Les Troyens|The Trojans]]'', directed by [[John Gielgud]] and conducted by Kubelik.<ref>Rosenthal, p. 669</ref> ''The Times'' commented, "It has never been a success; but it is now".<ref>"'The Trojans' at Covent Garden", ''The Times'', 7 June 1957, p. 3.</ref>  The second celebrated production of the late 1950s was in 1958, marking the present theatre's centenary: a production by [[Luchino Visconti]] of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Don Carlos]]'', with Vickers, Gobbi, Christoff, [[Gr<U+00E9> Brouwenstijn]] and  [[Fedora Barbieri]], conducted by [[Carlo Maria Giulini]].<ref>Haltrecht, p. 235</ref> The work was then a rarity,{{#tag:ref|The last Covent Garden performances had been given by Beecham in 1933.<ref name=iln>"An Outstanding International Cast in a Special Production: Verdi's 'Don Carlos' at Covent Garden", ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 17 May 1958, p. 838</ref>|group= n}} and had hitherto been widely regarded as impossible to stage satisfactorily, but Visconti's production was a triumph.<ref name=iln/><ref>Haltrecht, p. 236</ref>

===1960s===
[[File:Sir George Solti Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|upright|right|175px|Georg Solti, musical director 1961<U+2013>71]]{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#F3F0FD |salign=right| quote =  [Solti] announced his intention of making Covent Garden 'quite simply, the best opera house in the world', and in the opinion of many he succeeded.| source = ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' <ref>Jacobs, Arthur and Jos<U+00E9> A.

Kubelik did not renew his contract when it expired, and from 1958 there was an interregnum until 1961, when [[Georg Solti]] was appointed musical director. With his previous experience in charge of the [[Bavarian State Opera|Munich]] and [[Opern- und Schauspielhaus Frankfurt|Frankfurt]] opera houses, Solti was at first uncertain that Covent Garden, not yet consistently reaching the top international level, was a post he wanted. Bruno Walter persuaded him otherwise, and he took up the musical directorship in August 1961.<ref>Haltrecht, p. 264</ref>  The press gave him a cautious welcome, but there was some concern about a drift away from the company's original policies: 
{{quote|[A] recent shift in policy towards engaging eminent singers and conductors from abroad, which is a reversion to what has been at once traditional and fatal to the establishment of a permanent organization, a kind of diffused grand season, has endangered the good work of the past fifteen years. ...

Solti, however, was an advocate of opera in the vernacular,<ref name=what>"What Sort of Opera for Covent Garden?", ''The Times'', 9 December 1960, p. 18</ref>{{#tag:ref|Lebrecht asserts that Solti was opposed to opera in English, but cites no evidence in support of the statement.<ref>Lebrecht, pp. 228<U+2013>229</ref>|group= n}} and promoted the development of British and Commonwealth singers in the company, frequently casting them in his recordings and important productions in preference to overseas artists.<ref>Haltrecht, p. 295</ref> Among those who came to prominence during the decade were [[Gwyneth Jones (soprano)|Gwyneth Jones]] and [[Peter Glossop]].<ref name=gramobit>[[Alan Blyth|Blyth, Alan]].

The company's repertory in the 1960s combined the standard operatic works and less familiar pieces. The five composers whose works were given most frequently were Verdi, [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], Wagner, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Richard Strauss]]; the next most performed composer was Britten.<ref name=goodman57>Goodman and Harewood, p. 57</ref> Rarities performed in the 1960s included operas by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and [[Leo<U+0161> Jan<U+00E1><U+010D>ek|Jan<U+00E1><U+010D>ek]], (neither composer's works being as common in the opera house then as now), and works by [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]], [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]] and [[Michael Tippett|Tippett]]. There was also a celebrated production of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Moses und Aron|Moses and Aaron]]'' in the 1965<U+2013>66 and 1966<U+2013>67 seasons.<ref>Goodman and Harewood, pp. 57<U+2013>59</ref> In the mainstream repertoire, a highlight of the decade was [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s production of ''[[Tosca]]'' in 1964 with Callas, [[Renato Cioni]] and Gobbi.<ref>Haltrecht, p. 281</ref> Among the guest conductors who appeared at Covent Garden during the 1960s were [[Otto Klemperer]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Claudio Abbado]] and [[Colin Davis]].<ref>Drogheda et al, p. 151 (Klemperer), "Boulez at Covent Garden", ''The Times'', 15 October 1969 (Boulez), "Strong cast for Garden Carlos", ''The Times'', 20 June 1968, p. 9 (Abbado), and Haltrecht, p. 301 (Davis)</ref> Guest singers included [[Jussi Bj<U+00F6>rling]], [[Mirella Freni]], [[Sena Jurinac]], [[Irmgard Seefried]] and [[Astrid Varnay]].<ref>"Bj<U+00F6>rling in Boh<U+00E8>me", ''The Times'' 11 March 1960, p. 15 (Bj<U+00F6>rling), "Gemlike Freni Against a Shabby Setting", ''The Times'' 9 June 1965, p. 16 (Freni), "Miss Jurinac as Mimi", ''The Times'' 29 April 1963 (Jurinac), "Outstanding Octavian", ''The Times'' 3 October 1962, p. 12 (Seefried), and "Covent Garden's new opera plan", ''The Times'', 20 June 1967, p. 6 (Varnay)</ref>

The company made occasional appearances away from the Royal Opera House. Touring within Britain was limited to the centres with large enough theatres to accommodate the company's productions,<ref>Haltrecht, p. 198</ref> but in 1964, the company made its first appearance at [[the Proms]] in London, in a concert performance of ''[[Otello]]''.<ref>"Covent Garden Otello at the Proms", ''The Times'', 7 August 1964, p. 14</ref> Thereafter an annual appearance at the Proms was a regular feature of the company's schedule for many years.<ref>Goodman and Harewood, p. 11</ref> In 1970, Solti led the company to Germany, where they gave ''Don Carlos'', ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' and a new work by [[Richard Rodney Bennett]]. All but two of the principals were British. The public in Munich and Berlin were, according to the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', "beside themselves with enthusiasm".<ref>Quoted in Lebrecht, p. 281</ref>

In 1968, on the recommendation of the [[Home Secretary]], [[James Callaghan]], the [[Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]] conferred the title "the Royal Opera" on the company. It was the third stage company in the UK to be so honoured, following the Royal Ballet and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]].<ref>"The Royal Opera", ''The Times'', 24 October 1968, p. 3</ref>

===1970 to 1986===
[[File:Colindavis1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Colin Davis, musical director, 1971<U+2013>86]]
Webster retired in June 1970. The music critic Charles Osborne wrote, "When he retired, he handed over to his successor an organization of which any opera house in the world might be proud. No memorial could be more appropriate".<ref>Osborne, Charles. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/957050 "David Webster",] ''The Musical Times'', 1 July 1971, p. 694 {{subscription}}</ref> The successor was Webster's former assistant, [[John Tooley]].<ref>Donaldson, p. 148</ref> One of Webster's last important decisions had been to recommend to the board that Colin Davis should be invited to take over as musical director when Solti left in 1971. It was announced in advance that Davis would work in tandem with [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]], appointed director of productions. Peter Brook had briefly held that title in the company's early days,<ref>Gilbert and Shir, pp. 83<U+2013>89</ref> but in general the managerial structure of the opera company differed markedly from that of the ballet. The latter had always had its own director, subordinate to the chief executive of the opera house but with, in practice, a great degree of autonomy.<ref name=knight>"The Knight at the Opera", ''The Times'', 24 November 1980, p. 16</ref> The opera company was generally run by the chief executive of the opera house and the musical director of the opera company.<ref name=knight/><ref>Boursnell and Thubron, p. 54</ref> Appointing a substantial theatrical figure such as Hall was an important departure.<ref>Haltrecht, p. 301</ref> Hall, however, changed his mind, and did not take up the appointment, going instead to run the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]].<ref>Waymark, Peter. "Peter Hall will not take Royal Opera job", ''The Times'', 8 July 1971, p. 1, and Haltrecht, p. 301</ref> His defection, and the departure to [[Opera Australia|Australian Opera]] of the staff conductor [[Edward Downes]], a noted Verdi expert, left the company weakened on both production and musical sides.<ref name=g460/>

Like his predecessors, Davis experienced hostility from sections of the audience in his early days in charge.<ref name=levin/> His first production after taking over was a well-received ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]'', in which [[Kiri Te Kanawa]] achieved immediate stardom,<ref>Donaldson, p. 156</ref> but booing was heard at a "disastrous" ''[[Nabucco]]'' in 1971,<ref name=canning/> and his conducting of Wagner's ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' was at first compared unfavourably with that of his predecessor.<ref name=canning/> The Covent Garden board briefly considered replacing him, but was dissuaded by its chairman, [[Charles Moore, 11th Earl of Drogheda|Lord Drogheda]].<ref name=g460>Gilbert and Shir, p. 460</ref> Davis's Mozart was generally admired; he received much praise for reviving the little-known ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'' in 1974.<ref name=g460/> Among his other successes were ''The Trojans'' and ''[[Benvenuto Cellini (opera)|Benvenuto Cellini]]''.<ref name=canning/> 

Under Davis, the opera house introduced Prom performances, giving, as [[Bernard Levin]] wrote, "an opportunity for those (particularly the young, of course) who could not normally afford the price of stalls tickets to sample the view from the posher quarters at the trifling cost of <U+00A3>3 and a willingness to sit on the floor".<ref name=levin/> Davis conducted more than 30 operas during his 15-year tenure,<ref name=cdgrove>[[Andrew Porter (music critic)|Porter, Andrew]] and [[Alan Blyth]].

===1987 to 2002===
[[File:London Barbican Hall LSO Haitink-crop.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Bernard Haitink, music director 1985 to 2002]]
To succeed Davis, the Covent Garden board chose [[Bernard Haitink]], who was then the musical director of the [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne Festival]]. He was highly regarded for the excellence of his performances, though his repertory was not large.<ref name=bh/> In particular, he was not known as an interpreter of the Italian opera repertoire (and conducted no Puccini and only three Verdi works during his music directorship at Covent Garden.)<ref name=bh/> His tenure began well; a cycle of the Mozart [[Lorenzo Da Ponte|Da Ponte]] operas directed by [[Johannes Schaaf]] was a success, and although a ''Ring'' cycle with the Russian director [[Yuri Lyubimov]] could not be completed, a substitute staging of the cycle directed by [[G<U+00F6>tz Friedrich]] was well received.<ref name=bh>Clements, Andrew. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2002/jun/21/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures?INTCMP=SRCH "A great musician - but that was not enough",] ''The Guardian'', 21 June 2002</ref> Musically and dramatically the company prospered into the 1990s. A 1993 production of ''[[Die Meistersinger von N<U+00FC>rnberg|Die Meistersinger]]'' conducted by Haitink and starring John Tomlinson, [[Thomas Allen (baritone)|Thomas Allen]], [[Gosta Winbergh]] and [[Nancy Gustafson]], was widely admired,<ref>Seckerson, Edward.

For some time, purely musical considerations were overshadowed by practical and managerial crises at the Royal Opera House. Sir John Tooley retired as general director in 1988, and his post was given to the television executive [[Jeremy Isaacs]]. Tooley later forsook his customary reticence and pronounced the Isaacs period a disaster, citing poor management that failed to control inflated manning levels with a consequent steep rise in costs and ticket prices.<ref name=fay>Fay, Stephen. [http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:TND1&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=132051AB1A2FE738&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=102CDD40F14C6BDA "Book review: Torn curtain - Never Mind the Moon by Jeremy Isaacs",] ''The Independent on Sunday'', 21 November 1999 </ref> The uneasy relations between Isaacs and his colleagues, notably Haitink, were also damaging.<ref name=fay/> Tooley concluded that under Isaacs "Covent Garden had become a place of corporate entertainment, no longer a theatre primarily for opera and ballet lovers".<ref name=fay/> Isaacs was widely blamed for the poor public relations arising from the 1996 [[BBC]] television series ''The House'', in which cameras were permitted to film the day-to-day backstage life of the opera and ballet companies and the running of the theatre. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' commented, "For years, the Opera House was a byword for mismanagement and chaos. Its innermost workings were exposed to public ridicule by the BBC fly-on-the-wall series ''The House''".<ref>Thomas, David. [http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:DSTC&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=104D6E7A2B016008&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=102CDD40F14C6BDA "All's well in Tony's house <U+2013> Where chaos and darkness once reigned, all now seems sweetness and light <U+2013> and profit".] ''The Daily Telegraph'', 29 August 2004</ref>

The most disruptive event of the decade for both the opera and the ballet companies was the closure of the Royal Opera House between 1997 and 1999 for major rebuilding. ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' asserted that Isaacs "hopelessly mismanaged the closure of the Opera House during its redevelopment".<ref name=fay/> Isaacs, the paper states, turned down the chance of a temporary move to the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] almost next door to the opera house, pinning his hopes on a proposed new temporary building on London's [[South Bank]].<ref name=fay/> That scheme was refused planning permission, leaving the opera and ballet companies homeless. Isaacs resigned in December 1996, nine months before the expiry of his contract.<ref name=fay/> Haitink, dismayed by events, threatened to leave, but was persuaded to stay and keep the opera company going in a series of temporary homes in London theatres and concert halls.<ref name=bh/> A semi-staged ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] gained superlative reviews and won many new admirers for Haitink and the company, whose members included Tomlinson, [[Anne Evans]] and [[Hildegard Behrens]].{{#tag:ref| In the arts pages of ''[[The Financial Times]]'', Andrew Clark wrote, "It played to the highest number of people that Wagner's tetralogy has probably ever witnessed at a single sitting. Tickets were sold out weeks in advance, with 20 per cent costing a mere <U+00A3>7.50 for each of the four evenings. The set, a narrow promontory in front of the orchestra, must have been the cheapest in Ring history. The all-black costumes can't have cost much either <U+2013> and yet the performances pulsated with human drama".<ref>Clark, Andrew.

After Isaacs left, there was a period of managerial instability, with three chief executives in three years. Isaacs's successor, [[Genista McIntosh]], resigned in May 1997 after five months, citing ill-health.<ref>Lebrecht, pp. 417<U+2013>419</ref> Her post was filled by [[Mary Allen]], who moved into the job from the [[Arts Council of England|Arts Council]].

[[File:Antonio Pappano.JPG|thumb|left|[[Antonio Pappano]] (right), music director since 2002]]
Following years of disruption and conflict, stability was restored to the opera house and its two companies after the appointment of a new chief executive in May 2001, [[Tony Hall, Baron Hall of Birkenhead|Tony Hall]], formerly a senior executive at the BBC. The following year the young conductor [[Antonio Pappano]] succeeded Haitink as music director of the Royal Opera. As at 2011, both Hall and Pappano remain in post.
