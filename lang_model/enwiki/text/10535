'''''Fantasia''''' is a 1940 American [[animated film]] produced by [[Walt Disney]] and released by [[Walt Disney Productions]]. With story direction by [[Joe Grant]] and [[Dick Huemer]], and production supervision by [[Ben Sharpsteen]], it is the third feature in the [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Disney animated features canon]]. The film consists of eight animated segments set to pieces of classical music conducted by [[Leopold Stokowski]]; seven of which are performed by the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]. Music critic and composer [[Deems Taylor]] acts as the film's [[Master of Ceremonies]], who introduces each segment in live action interstitial scenes.

Disney settled on the film's concept as work neared completion on ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'', an elaborate ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' short designed as a comeback role for [[Mickey Mouse]], who had declined in popularity. As production costs grew higher than what it could earn, he decided to include the short in a feature-length film with other segments set to classical pieces. The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with [[Fantasound]], a pioneering sound reproduction system that made ''Fantasia'' the first commercial film shown in [[stereophonic sound]].

''Fantasia'' was first released in [[roadshow theatrical release|theatrical roadshow engagements]] held in thirteen U.S. cities from November 13, 1940. It received mixed critical reaction and was unable to make a profit due to World War II cutting off the profitable European market, the film's high production costs, and the expense of leasing theatres and installing the Fantasound equipment for the roadshow presentations.  The film was subsequently reissued multiple times with its original footage and audio being deleted, modified, or restored in each version. As of 2012, ''Fantasia'' has grossed $76.4 million in domestic revenue and is the 22nd highest-grossing film of all time in the U.S. when [[inflation adjustment|adjusted for inflation]]. Walt's nephew [[Roy E. Disney]] co-produced a sequel released in 1999 titled ''[[Fantasia 2000]]''. Today the film is widely acclaimed, and in 1998 the [[American Film Institute]] ranked it as the 58th greatest American film in their [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years...100 Movies]] and the 5th greatest animated film in their [[AFI's 10 Top 10|10 Top 10]] list.

== Program ==
[[File:Fantasia theatrical trailer.png|thumb|right|Title screen in the original theatrical trailer]]
''Fantasia'' opens with live action scenes of members of an orchestra gathering against a blue background and tuning their instruments in half-light, half-shadow. Master of ceremonies [[Deems Taylor]] enters the stage (also in half-light, half-shadow) and introduces the program.

* ''[[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565|Toccata and Fugue in D Minor]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. Live-action shots of the orchestra illuminated in blue and gold, backed by [[superimposed]] shadows, fade into [[abstract art|abstract]] patterns. Animated lines, shapes and cloud formations reflect the sound and rhythms of the music.<ref>Culhane, p. 35</ref>
* ''[[The Nutcracker|Nutcracker Suite]]'' by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]. Selections from the ballet suite underscore scenes depicting the changing of the seasons from summer to autumn to winter. A variety of dances are presented with fairies, fish, flowers, mushrooms, and leaves, including "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy", "Chinese Dance", "Dance of the Flutes", "Arabian Dance", "Russian Dance" and "Waltz of the Flowers".<ref>Culhane, p. 45</ref>
* ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' by [[Paul Dukas]]. Based on [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s 1797 poem "[[Der Zauberlehrling]]". [[Mickey Mouse]], the young apprentice of the sorcerer Yen Sid, attempts some of his master's magic tricks but doesn't know how to control them.<ref>Culhane, p. 79</ref>
* ''[[The Rite of Spring|Rite of Spring]]'' by [[Igor Stravinsky]]. A visual history of the Earth's beginnings is depicted to selected sections of the ballet score. The sequence progresses from the planet's formation to the first living creatures, followed by the reign and extinction of the dinosaurs.<ref>Culhane, p. 107</ref>
* Intermission/''Meet the Soundtrack'': The orchestra musicians depart and the ''Fantasia'' title card is revealed. After the intermission there is a brief [[jam session]] of jazz music led by a clarinettist as the orchestra members return. Then a humorously stylized demonstration of how sound is rendered on film is shown. An animated sound track "character", initially a straight white line, changes into different shapes and colors based on the sounds played.<ref>Culhane, pp. 128<U+2013>132</ref>
* ''[[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|The Pastoral Symphony]]'' by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. A mythical [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] world of centaurs, cupids, fauns and other figures from [[classical mythology]] is portrayed to Beethoven's music. A gathering for a festival to honor [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], the god of wine, is interrupted by [[Zeus]], who creates a storm and throws lightning bolts at the attendees.<ref>Culhane, p. 133</ref>
* ''[[Dance of the Hours]]'' by [[Amilcare Ponchielli]]. A comic ballet in four sections: Madame Upanova and her ostriches (Morning); Hyacinth Hippo and her servants (Afternoon); Elephanchine and her bubble-blowing elephant troupe (Evening); and Ben Ali Gator and his troop of alligators (Night). The finale finds all of the characters dancing together until their palace collapses.<ref>Culhane, p. 161</ref>
* ''[[Night on Bald Mountain]]'' by [[Modest Mussorgsky]] and ''[[Ave Maria (Schubert)|Ave Maria]]'' by [[Franz Schubert]]. At midnight the devil [[Chernobog|Chernabog]] summons evil spirits and restless souls from their graves. The spirits dance and fly through the air until driven back by the sound of an [[Angelus bell]] as night fades into dawn. A chorus is heard singing ''Ave Maria'' as a line of robed monks is depicted walking with lighted torches through a forest and into the ruins of a cathedral.<ref>Culhane, p. 181</ref>

== Production ==

=== Origins ===
[[File:Leopold Stokowski LOC 26447u.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Leopold Stokowski]] conducted the film's score.]]
In 1936, [[Walt Disney]] felt that the Disney studio's star character [[Mickey Mouse]] needed a boost in popularity. He decided to feature the mouse in ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'', a deluxe cartoon short based on the [[Der Zauberlehrling|poem]] written by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and set to the [[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|orchestral piece]] by [[Paul Dukas]] inspired by the original tale.<ref name=la1990>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-26/news/tv-552_1_walt-disney|first=Charles|last=Solomon|title=Fantastic 'Fantasia' - Disney Channel Takes a Look at Walt's Great Experiment in Animation|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 26, 1990|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}</ref> The concept of matching animation to classical music was used as early as 1928 in Disney's cartoon series, the ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'', but he wanted to go beyond the usual slapstick, and produce shorts where "sheer fantasy unfolds&nbsp;... action controlled by a musical pattern has great charm in the realm of unreality."<ref>Culhane, p. 13</ref><ref>Barrier 2003, p. 242</ref> Upon receiving the rights to use the music by the end of July 1937,<ref name=cul80-84>Culhane, pp. 80<U+2013>84</ref> Disney considered using a well-known conductor to record the music for added prestige. He happened to meet [[Leopold Stokowski]], conductor of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] since 1912, at [[Chasen's]] restaurant in [[Hollywood]], and talked about his plans for the short. Stokowski recalled that he did "like the music"; was happy to collaborate on the project, and offered to conduct the piece at no cost.<ref name=millimeter>{{Cite news|last=Smith|first=David R.|date=February 1976|title=The Sorcerer's Apprentice: Birthplace of Fantasia|work=Millimeter Magazine|pages=18<U+2013>20, 22, 24, 64<U+2013>67}}</ref>

Following their meeting, Disney's New York representative ran into Stokowski on a train headed for the East Coast. In writing to Disney, he reported that Stokowski was "really serious in his offer to do the music for nothing. He had some very interesting ideas on instrumental coloring, which would be perfect for an animation medium".<ref name=millimeter/> In his excited response dated October 26, 1937, Disney wrote that he felt "all steamed up over the idea of Stokowski working with us&nbsp;... The union of Stokowski and his music, together with the best of our medium, would be the means of a success and should lead to a new style of motion picture presentation."<ref name=pel235 /> He had already begun working on a story outline, and wished to use "the finest men&nbsp;... from color&nbsp;... down to animators"<ref name=fammuseumfant /> on the short. ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' was to be promoted as a "special" and rented to theatres as a unique film, outside of the [[Mickey Mouse film series|Mickey Mouse cartoon series]].<ref name=millimeter/><ref>Barrier 2003, p. 243</ref>

[[File:Deems Taylor portrait by Carl Van Vechten.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Deems Taylor]] was the film's [[Master of Ceremonies]], who introduced each segment in live action interstitial scenes.]]
An agreement signed by Disney and Stokowski on December 16, 1937 allowed the conductor to "select and employ a complete symphony orchestra" for the recording.<ref name=orchvsdisney93 /> Disney hired a stage at the [[Culver Studios]] in California for the session. It began at midnight on January 9, 1938, and lasted for three hours using eighty-five Hollywood musicians.<ref name=cul15-16 /> As production costs of ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' climbed to $125,000, it became clearer to Disney and his brother [[Roy O. Disney|Roy]], who managed the studio's finances, that the short could never earn such a sum back on its own.<ref name=la1990 /> Roy wanted his brother to keep any additional costs on the film to a minimum. He said, "because of its very experimental and unprecedented nature&nbsp;... we have no idea what can be expected from such a production."<ref name=millimeter/> [[Ben Sharpsteen]], a production supervisor on ''Fantasia'', noted that its budget was three to four times greater than the usual ''Silly Symphony'', but Disney "saw this trouble in the form of an opportunity. This was the birth of a new concept, a group of separate numbers<U+2014>regardless of their running time<U+2014>put together in a single presentation. It turned out to be a concert<U+2014>something novel and of high quality."<ref name=cul18 />

Ideas to produce a complete feature film were pursued in February 1938, when inquiries were made to extend Stokowski's contract.<ref name=cul18>Culhane, p. 18</ref> In August, Disney asked Stokowski's representative to have him return to the studios to select material for the new film, which was initially titled ''The Concert Feature''.<ref name=millimeter/> The pair further thought of presenting the film with an on-screen host to introduce each number in the program. Both had heard composer and music critic [[Deems Taylor]] provide intermission commentary during radio broadcasts of the [[New York Philharmonic]], and agreed he would be most suitable for the role.<ref name=pel235>Pegolotti, p. 235</ref> Disney did contact Taylor about the project, but by then work on ''[[Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Bambi]]'', and development on his new [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Burbank studio]] kept him too busy to work on the new feature.<ref>Pegolotti, p. 233</ref> In a change of plans, Taylor was asked during a call on September 3, 1938, leave to come to the studios as soon as possible. He left [[New York City]] for [[Los Angeles]] by train two days later for a month's visit.<ref name=pel235 />

=== Development ===
Taylor arrived at the studio one day after a series of meetings began to select the musical pieces for ''The Concert Feature''. Disney made story writers [[Joe Grant]] and [[Dick Huemer]] gather a preliminary selection of music and along with Stokowski, Taylor, and the heads of various departments, discussed their ideas.<ref name=cul18 /> Each meeting was recorded verbatim by stenographers with participants being given a copy of the entire conversation for review. As selections were considered, a recording of the piece was located and played back at the next gathering.<ref name=pel236>Pegolotti, p. 236</ref> Disney did not contribute much to early discussions; he admitted that his knowledge of music was instinctive and untrained.<ref name=allan96>Allan, p. 96</ref> In one meeting, he inquired about a piece "on which we might build something of a prehistoric theme&nbsp;... with animals".<ref>Pegolotti, p. 237</ref> The group was considering ''[[The Firebird]]'' by Igor Stravinsky, but Taylor noted that his "''Le Sacre du printemps'' would be something on that order", to which Disney replied upon hearing a recording, "This is marvelous! It would be perfect for prehistoric animals. There would be something terrific in dinosaurs, flying lizards, and prehistoric monsters. There could be beauty in the settings."<ref name=culhanenytimes1990>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/14/books/l-disney-stravinsky-and-the-sock-232890.html?scp=62&sq=fantasia+disney&st=nyt |title= Disney, Stravinsky and 'The Sock' |work=The New York Times |first=John |last=Culhane |date=January 14, 1990 |accessdate=January 21, 2011}}</ref>

Numerous choices were discarded as talks continued, including ''Moto Perpetuo'' by [[Niccol<U+00F2> Paganini]] with "shots of dynamos, cogs, pistons" and "whirling wheels" to show the production of a collar button. Other deleted material included ''[[Prelude in G minor (Rachmaninoff)|Prelude in G minor]]'' and ''[[The Seasons (Tchaikovsky)|Troika]]'' by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], and a rendition of "The Song of the Flea" by Mussorgsky, which was to be sung by [[Lawrence Tibbett]].<ref name=allan97>Allan, p. 97</ref> On September 29, 1938, around sixty of Disney's artists gathered for a two-and-a-half hour piano concert while he provided a running commentary about the new musical feature. A rough version of ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' was also shown that, according to one attendee, had the crowd applauding and cheering "until their hands were red."<ref name=gab308>Gabler, p. 308</ref> The final pieces were chosen the following morning, which included ''Toccata and Fugue in D minor'', ''[[Cydalise et le Ch<U+00E8>vre-pied]]'' by [[Gabriel Piern<U+00E9>]], ''The Nutcracker Suite'', ''Night on Bald Mountain'', ''Ave Maria'', ''Dance of the Hours'', ''[[Suite bergamasque|Clair de Lune]]'' by [[Claude Debussy]], ''The Rite of Spring'' and ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice''.<ref name=gab308 /> Disney had already begun working out the details for the segments, and showed greater enthusiasm and eagerness as opposed to his anxiety while starting on ''Pinocchio''.<ref name=barr03-247>Barrier 2003, p. 247</ref>

''Clair de Lune'' was soon removed from the ''Fantasia'' program, but Disney and his writers encountered problems of setting a concrete story to ''Cydalise''. Its opening march, "The Entry of the Little Fauns", attracted Disney to the piece which at first provided suitable depictions of fauns he wanted. On January 5, 1939, following a search for a stronger piece to fit the mythological theme, the piece was replaced with sections of Beethoven's sixth symphony.<ref name=bar03-p252-3>Barrier 2003, pp. 252<U+2013>253</ref> Stokowski disagreed with the switch, believing that Disney's "idea of mythology&nbsp;... is not quite what this symphony is about". He was also concerned about the reception from classical music enthusiasts who would criticize Disney for venturing too far from the composer's intent.<ref>Gabler, pp. 317<U+2013>318</ref> Taylor on the other hand welcomed the change, describing it as "a stunning one", and saw "no possible objection to it".<ref name=culhanebook134>Culhane, p. 134</ref>

The new feature continued to be known as ''The Concert Feature'' or ''Musical Feature'' as late as November 1938. Hal Horne, a publicist for Disney's film distributor [[RKO Radio Pictures]], wished for a different title, and gave the suggestion ''Filmharmonic Concert''. [[Stuart Buchanan]] then held a contest at the studio for a title that produced almost 1,800 suggestions including ''Bach to Stravinsky and Bach'' and ''Highbrowski by Stokowski''. Still, the favorite among the film's supervisors was ''Fantasia'', an early working title that had even grown on Horne, "It isn't the word alone but the meaning we read into it."<ref>Gabler, p. 316</ref> From the beginning of its development, Disney expressed the greater importance of music in ''Fantasia'' compared to his past work: "In our ordinary stuff, our music is always under action, but on this&nbsp;... we're supposed to be picturing this music<U+2014>not the music fitting our story."<ref>Barrier 2003, p. 248</ref> Disney had hoped that the film would bring classical music to people that, including himself, had "walked out on this kind of stuff."<ref name=latimesmagic1990>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-07/entertainment/ca-3186_1_walt-disney |title= It Wasn't Always Magic |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Charles |last=Solomon |date=October 7, 1990 |accessdate=January 21, 2011}}</ref>

=== Design and animation ===
[[File:Disney taylor stokowski.jpg|right|thumb|Disney acting out a scene in ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' for Taylor and Stokowski.]]
Animation on ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' began on January 21, 1938 when [[James Algar]], the director of the segment, assigned animator [[Preston Blair]] to work on the scene when Mickey Mouse wakes from his dream.<ref name=cul22 /> Each of the seven hundred members of staff at the time received a synopsis of Goethe's 1797 poem ''[[Der Zauberlehrling]]'', and were encouraged to complete a twenty-question form that requested their ideas on what action might take place.<ref name=cul80-84 /><ref name=cul15-16 /> Layout artist Tom Codrick created what Dick Huemer described as "brilliantly colored thumbnails" from preliminary storyboard sketches using [[gouache|gouache paints]], which featured bolder use of color and lighting than any previous Disney short.<ref>Barrier 2003, p. 251</ref> Mickey was redesigned by animator [[Fred Moore (animator)|Fred Moore]] who added pupils to his eyes for the first time to achieve greater ranges of expression.<ref name=cul80-84 /><ref name=chic1990>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-09-23/entertainment/9003190603_1_leopold-stokowski-silly-symphony-classical-music |title= The Fantasy Of Disney's 'Fantasia' - 50 Years Later, It's Still A Classical Masterpiece |first=Dick |last=Adler |work=Chicago Tribune |date=September 23, 1990 |accessdate=January 17, 2011}}</ref> Most of the segment was shot in live action, including a scene where a [[UCLA]] athlete was asked to run and jump across one of the studio's sound stages with barrels in the way, which was used for reference when Mickey traverses through water.<ref>Barrier 2003, p. 244</ref>

Disney had been interested in producing abstract animation since he saw ''A Color Box'' by [[Len Lye]] from 1935. He explained the work done in the ''Toccata and Fugue'' was "no sudden idea&nbsp;... they were something we had nursed along several years but we never had a chance to try".<ref name=cul36-38>Culhane, pp. 36<U+2013>38</ref> Preliminary designs included those from effects animator [[Cy Young]], who produced drawings influenced by the patterns on the edge of a piece of sound film.<ref name=bar03-p252-3 /> In late 1938 Disney hired [[Oskar Fischinger]], a German artist who had produced numerous abstract animated films, including some with classical music, to work with Young. Upon review of three [[leica reel]]s produced by the two, Disney rejected all three. According to Huemer all Fishinger "did was little triangles and designs&nbsp;... it didn't come off at all. Too dinky, Walt said."<ref>Barrier 2003, p. 254</ref> Fischinger, like Disney, was used to having full control over his work and was not used to working in a group. Feeling his designs were too abstract for a mass audience,<ref name=la1990 /> Fishinger left the studio in apparent despair, before the segment was completed, in October 1939.<ref>Culhane, pp. 42<U+2013>43</ref> Disney had plans to make the ''Toccata and Fugue'' an experimental three-dimensional film, with audiences being given cardboard [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic frames]] with their souvenir programs, but this idea was abandoned.<ref name=cul36-38 />

In ''The Nutcracker Suite'', animator [[Art Babbitt]] is said to have credited [[The Three Stooges]] as a guide for animating the dancing mushrooms in the ''Chinese Dance'' routine. He drew with a music score pinned to his desk to work out the choreography so he could relate the action to the melody and the counterpoint, "those nasty little notes underneath&nbsp;... so something has to be related to that".<ref>Culhane, pp. 53<U+2013>54</ref> The studio filmed professional dancers Joyce Coles and Marjorie Belcher wearing ballet skirts that resembled shapes of blossoms that were to sit above water for ''Dance of the Flutes''. An Arabian dancer was also brought in to study the movements for the goldfish in ''Arab Dance''.<ref>Culhane, p. 61</ref>

An early concept for ''The Rite of Spring'' was to extend the story to the age of mammals and the first humans and the discovery of fire and man's triumph. [[John Hubley]], the segment's art director, explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from [[Creationism|creationists]], who promised to make trouble should he connect [[evolution]] with humans.<ref>Culhane, p. 126</ref> To gain a better understanding of the history of the planet the studio received guidance from [[Roy Chapman Andrews]], the director of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], English biologist [[Julian Huxley]], paleontologist [[Barnum Brown]], and astronomer [[Edwin Hubble]].<ref name=fammuseumfant>{{cite web|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/exhibits/articles/fantasia/index.html| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061128022950/http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/exhibits/articles/fantasia/index.html|archivedate=November 28, 2006|title=Fantasia|author=Holliss, Richard| publisher=Disney.com|accessdate=October 28, 2011}}</ref><ref name=cul120-121 /> Animators studied comets and [[nebulae]] at the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]], and observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio.<ref name=time1940>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,777534-1,00.html |title= Music: Disney's Cinesymphony |work=Time Magazine |date=November 18, 1940 |accessdate=February 12, 2011}}</ref> The camera was kept at a low position throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs.<ref name=cul120-121>Culhane, pp. 120<U+2013>121</ref>

According to [[Ward Kimball]], the animators were "extremely specific on touchy issues". In the making of ''The Pastoral Symphony'' Greek mythological segment, the female centaurs were originally drawn bare-breasted, but the Hays office insisted that they discreetly hung garlands around the necks.<ref name="Pinsky36">Pinsky, p. 36</ref> The male centaurs were also toned down to appear less intimidating to the audience. Originally black female centaurs "braided 'pickaninny' hair, shining the hooves and grooming the tails of white centaurs" appeared in the film, but this was cut out years later for racial prejudicial reasons (see Controversies).<ref name="Pinsky36"/> 

For inspiration on the routines in ''Dance of the Hours'', animators studied real life ballet performers including [[Marge Champion]] and [[Irina Baronova]].<ref name=chic1990 /> Animator [[John Hench]] was assigned to work on the segment, but resisted as he knew little about ballet. Disney then gave Hench season tickets to the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]] with backstage access so he could learn more about it.<ref name=denwill136>Denney and Williams, p. 136</ref> [[B<U+00E9>la Lugosi]], best known for his role in ''[[Dracula (1931 film)|Dracula]]'', was brought in to provide reference poses for Chernabog. As animator [[Bill Tytla]] disliked the results, he used colleague [[Wilfred Jackson]] to pose shirtless which gave him the images he needed.<ref name=la1990 /> According to R. D. Feild's ''The Art of Walt Disney'', in order to draw Hyacinth, the hippo prima ballerina, a black woman weighing over 200 pounds was brought onto the live-action stage and her movements were recorded by cameramen, recording the "least quiver of her flesh, noticing those parts of her anatomy that were subjected to the greatest stress and strain".<ref name="Pinsky36"/>  There were ideas of releasing scents throughout the theater during ''Fantasia'', including the smell of [[incense]] during ''Ave Maria''.<ref>Barrier 2003, p. 246</ref> 

Over one thousand artists and technicians were used in the making of ''Fantasia'',<ref name=vhs1991>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=Ya0fAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2tYEAAAAIBAJ&dq=fantasia&pg=1148%2C8087297 |title='Fantasia' marks anniversary with video |work= The Southeast Missourian |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |date= October 29, 1991 |first=David |last=Hente}}</ref> which features more than 500 animated characters.<ref name=mont1943>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=z30tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-JgFAAAAIBAJ&dq=fantasia%20500%20characters&pg=5791%2C1440462 |title='Fantasia' returning in complete version |work= The Montreal Gazette |date=May 8, 1943 |accessdate= February 12, 2011}}</ref> Segments were color-keyed scene by scene so the colors in a single shot would harmonize between proceeding and following ones.<ref name=cul150>Culhane, p. 150</ref> Before a segment's narrative pattern was complete, an overall color scheme was designed to the general mood of the music, and patterned to correspond with the development of the subject matter.<ref name=cul150/> The studio's character model department would also sculpt three-dimensional clay models so the animators could view their subject from all angles.<ref name=cul22>Culhane, p. 22</ref>

==== Recording ====
[[File:Phila AcademyofMusicl03.JPG|thumb|right|The film's score was recorded at the Philadelphia Academy of Music.]]
Disney wanted to experiment in more sophisticated [[sound recording and reproduction]] techniques for ''Fantasia''. "Music emerging from [[monaural|one speaker]] behind the screen sounds thin, tinkly and strainy. We wanted to reproduce such beautiful masterpieces&nbsp;... so that audiences would feel as though they were standing at the podium with Stokowski".<ref name=popscience>Andrew R.

==== Fantasound ====
The Disney brothers contacted [[David Sarnoff]] of RCA regarding the manufacture of a new system that would "create the illusion that the actual symphony orchestra is playing in the theater." Sarnoff backed out at first due to financial reasons, but agreed in July 1939 to make the equipment so long as the Disneys could hold down the estimated $200,000 in costs.<ref>Gabler, pp. 328<U+2013>329</ref> Though it was not exactly known how to achieve their goal, engineers at Disney and RCA investigated many ideas and tests made with various equipment setups.<ref name=tel38-40 /> The collaboration led to the development of [[Fantasound]], a pioneering [[stereophonic sound|stereophonic]] [[surround sound]] system which innovated some processes widely used today, including simultaneous [[multi-track recording]], [[overdubbing]], and [[noise reduction]].<ref name=shepherd />

Fantasound employed two projectors running at the same time. With one containing the picture film with a mono soundtrack for backup purposes, the other ran a sound film that was mixed from the eight tracks recorded at the Academy to four: three of which contained the audio for the left, center, and right stage speakers respectively, while the fourth became a control track with amplitude and frequency tones that drove [[variable-gain amplifier]]s to control the volume of the three audio tracks.<ref name=tel38-40 /> In addition were three "house" speakers placed on the left, right, and center of the auditorium that derived from the left and right stage channels which acted as [[surround channels]].<ref name=shepherd /> As the original recording was captured at almost peak modulation to increase [[signal-to-noise ratio]], the control track was used to restore the dynamics to where Stokowski thought they should be. For this, a tone-operated gain-adjusting device was built to control the levels of each of the three audio tracks through the amplifiers.<ref name=shepherd />

The illusion of sound traveling across the speakers was achieved with a device named the "[[Panning (audio)|pan pot]]", which directed the predetermined movement of each audio channel with the control track. Mixing of the soundtrack required six people to operate the various pan pots in real time, while Stokowski directed each level and pan change which was marked on his musical score. To monitor the recording levels at lower frequencies, Disney ordered eight three-color [[oscillators]] from the newly established [[Hewlett-Packard]] company,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,146906,00.html |title= Timeline: History of Hewlett-Packard |publisher= Fox News |date=February 9, 2005 |accessdate=January 18, 2011}}</ref> a predecessor from [[VU meter]]s used today. Between the individual takes, prints, and remakes, approximately three million feet of sound film was used in the production of ''Fantasia''.<ref name=popscience /> Almost a fifth of the film's budget was spent on its recording techniques.<ref>Gelder, pp. 87<U+2013>90</ref>{{-}}

[[File:Promises Promises at Broadway Theatre.JPG|right|thumb|The film's first roadshow opened at the Broadway Theatre in New York City on November 13, 1940.]]
RKO balked at the idea of distributing ''Fantasia'', which it described as a "longhair musical",<ref>Thomas 1994, p. 161</ref> and believed its duration of two hours and five minutes plus intermission was too long for a general release.<ref>Grant, p. 178</ref><ref name=dvdreleasehistory>"Re-Release Schedule" feature from ''The Fantasia Legacy'' DVD. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment (2000)</ref> It relaxed its exclusive distribution contract with Disney, who wanted a more prestigious exhibit in the form of a limited-run [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow attraction]]. A total of thirteen roadshows were held across the United States; each involving two daily screenings with seat reservations booked in advance at higher prices and a fifteen-minute intermission. Disney hired film salesman Irving Ludwig to manage the first eleven engagements,<ref>Gabler, p. 340</ref> who was given specific instructions regarding each aspect of the film's presentation, including the setup of outside theater marquees and curtain and lighting cues. Patrons were taken to their seats by staff hired and trained by Disney,<ref name=makingofdvd>''The Making of Fantasia'' documentary from ''The Fantasia Anthology'' DVD set.

Disney allowed RKO to handle the general release of ''Fantasia'', but fought their decision to have the film cut. He gave in as the studio needed as much income as possible to remedy its finances, but refused to cut it himself, "You can get anybody you want to edit it&nbsp;... I can't do it."<ref name=thom-162>Thomas 1994, p. 162</ref> With no input from Disney, musical director [[Edward H.

RKO reissued ''Fantasia'' once more on September 1, 1946, with the animated sequences complete and the scenes of Taylor, Stokowski, and the orchestra restored but shortened. Its running time was restored to one hour and fifty-five minutes.

By 1955 the original sound negatives began to deteriorate, though a four-track copy had survived in good condition. Using the remaining Fantasound system at the studio, a three-track stereo copy was transferred across telephone wires onto magnetic film at an RCA facility in Hollywood.<ref name=goldmark88/> This copy was used when ''Fantasia'' was reissued in stereo by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]] in SuperScope, a derivative of the [[anamorphosis|anamorphic]] widescreen [[CinemaScope]] format, on February 7, 1956.<ref name=dvdreleasehistory /> The projector featured an automatic control mechanism designed by Disney engineers that was coupled to a variable anamorphic lens, which allowed the picture to switch between its [[Academy ratio|Academy standard]] [[aspect ratio]] of 1.33:1 to the wide ratio of 2.35:1 in twenty seconds without a break in the film. This was achieved by placing the cues that controlled the mechanism on a separate track in addition to the three audio channels.

On February 20, 1963, ''Fantasia'' was re-released in both standard and SuperScope versions with stereo sound, though existing records are unclear.

''Fantasia'' began to make a profit from its $2.28 million budget after its return to theaters on December 17, 1969.<ref name=goldmark88/><ref name=dvdreleasehistory /> The film was promoted with a psychedelic-styled advertising campaign, and it became popular among teenagers and college students who were reported to have taken drugs for a [[psychedelic experience]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=cc0bAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WFAEAAAAIBAJ&dq=fantasia&pg=7439%2C1680455 |title= Revisited 'Fantasia' still thrills |work= The Pittsburgh Press |first= Kaspar |last= Monahan |accessdate=March 6, 2011 |date= April 5, 1970 }}</ref> Animator [[Ollie Johnston]] recalled that young people "thought we were on a trip when we made it&nbsp;... every time we'd go to talk to a school or something, they'd ask us what we were on."<ref name=herald1990 /> The release is also noted for the controversial [[#Controversies|removal]] of four scenes from ''The Pastoral Symphony'' over racial stereotyping. ''Fantasia'' was issued on a regular basis, typically for exhibition in art houses in college towns, until the mid-1970s.<ref name=dvdreleasehistory />

The film was reissued nationwide once more on April 15, 1977, this time with simulated stereo sound.<ref name=goldmark88/><ref name=cul30-31/> This edit featured the RKO distribution logo being replaced with that of Buena Vista Distribution, since RKO had not been part of a release since 1946.

For the 1982 and 1985 releases Disney presented ''Fantasia'' with a completely new soundtrack recorded in [[Dolby Stereo]]. First released on April 2, 1982<ref name=dvdreleasehistory /> this version of the film marked the first time a film's soundtrack had been digitally re-recorded in its entirety. To replace Stokowski's recordings, the noted film conductor [[Irwin Kostal]] was engaged.

For its fiftieth anniversary, ''Fantasia'' returned to 550 theaters nationwide on October 5, 1990 in its traditional 1946 version including the live action scenes with Taylor and the original Stokowski score. The film underwent a two-year restoration process which began after a six-month search to piece together the original negatives that had been in storage since 1946.

''Fantasia'' has received three home video releases. The first, featuring the 1990 restored theatrical version, was released on [[VHS]] and [[laser disc]] on November 1, 1991 as part of the "[[Walt Disney Classics]]" line. The 50-day release prompted 9.25 million advance orders for cassettes and a record 200,000 for discs, doubling the figure of the previous record. The "Deluxe Edition" package included the film, a "making of" feature, a commemorative [[lithograph]], a 16-page booklet, a two-disc soundtrack of the Stokowski score and a certificate of authenticity signed by [[Roy E.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
'''Initial release'''
[[File:Cathay Circle Theater.jpg|thumb|right|The film premiered at the [[Carthay Circle Theatre]] on January 30, 1940.]]
''Fantasia'' garnered significant critical acclaim at the time of release and was seen by some critics as a masterpiece.<ref name="LAT1941">{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2011/01/fantasia-acclaimed-as-film-masterpiece.html|title='Fantasia' Acclaimed as Film Masterpiece|publisher=''Los Angeles Times''|date=January 30, 1941|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}</ref> The premiere at the [[Carthay Circle Theatre]] was a grand affair, attracting some 5000 people, including [[Shirley Temple]], [[Cecil B. DeMille]], [[Forrest Tucker]], [[James Cagney]], [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]], James Murphy, [[Edgar Bergen]],  and many other notables in the film industry.<ref name="LAT1941"/> Among those at the film's premiere was film critic Edwin Schallert of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' who considered the film to be a magnificent achievement in film which would go down in film history as a landmark film, noting the rapturous applause the film received by the audience during the various interludes. He stated that ''Fantastia'' was "caviar to the general, ambrosia and nectar for the intelligentsia" and considered the film to be "courageous beyond relief".<ref name="LAT1941"/> Music critic of the newpaper, Isabel Morse Jones, was highly praising of the soundtrack to the film, believing it to be a "dream of a symphony concert", an "enormously varied concert of pictorial ideas, of abstract music by acknowledged composers, of performers Leopold Stokowski and orchestra players of Hollywood and Philadelphia, and, for the vast majority, new and wonderful sound effects".<ref name="LAT1941"/> [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', also at the premiere, noted that "motion-picture history was made last night&nbsp;... ''Fantasia'' dumps conventional formulas overboard and reveals the scope of films for imaginative excursion&nbsp;... ''Fantasia''&nbsp;... is simply terrific."<ref name=cul30-31 /> Peyton Boswell, an editor at ''Art Digest'', called it "an aesthetic experience never to be forgotten".<ref name=gold87 /> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine described the premiere as "stranger and more wonderful than any of Hollywood's" and the experience of Fantasound "as if the hearer were in the midst of the music. As the music sweeps to a climax, it froths over the proscenium arch, boils into the rear of the theatre, all but prances up and down the aisles."<ref name=time1940 /> ''[[Dance Magazine]]'' devoted its lead story to the film, saying that "the most extraordinary thing about ''Fantasia'' is, to a dancer or balletomane, not the miraculous musical recording, the range of color, or the fountainous integrity of the Disney collaborators, but quite simply the perfection of its dancing."<ref name=cul30-31 /> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also hailed ''Fantasia'', calling it "a successful experiment to lift the relationship from the plane of popular, mass entertainment to the higher strata of appeal to lovers of classical music."<ref name=varity1940>{{Cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790827/|title=Fantasia|work=Variety|date=November 12, 1940|first=John|last=C. Flinn Sr.|accessdate=November 9, 2011}}</ref> ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' assigned three writers to cover the film's Chicago premiere: society columnist Harriet Pribble; film critic Mae Tinee; and music critic Edward Barry. Pribble left amazed at the "brilliantly-attired audience", while Tinee felt the film was "beautiful&nbsp;... but it is also bewildering. It is stupendous. It is colossal. It is an overwhelmingly ambitious orgy of color, sound, and imagination. " Barry was pleased with the "program of good music well performed&nbsp;... and beautifully recorded" and felt "pleasantly distracted" from the music to what was shown on the screen.<ref name="tribune85"/> In a breakdown of reviews from both film and music critics, Disney author Paul Anderson found 33% to be "very positive", 22% both "positive" and "positive and negative", and 11% negative.<ref>Gabler, p. 342</ref>

Those who adopted a more negative view at the time of the film's release were mostly music critics who resisted the idea of presenting classical music with visual images, arguing that doing so would rob the musical pieces of their integrity. Composer and music critic [[Virgil Thomson]] praised Fantasound which he thought offered "good transmission of music", but disliked the "musical taste" of Stokowski, with exception to ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' and ''The Rite of Spring''.<ref name=cul30-31 /> [[Olin Downes]] of ''The New York Times'' too hailed the quality of sound that Fantasound presented, but said, "much of ''Fantasia'' distracted from or directly injured the scores."<ref name=cul30-31 /> Film critic [[Pauline Kael]] dismissed parts of ''Fantasia'' as "grotesquely [[kitsch]]y".<ref>Ward, p. 52</ref> Some parents resisted paying the higher roadshow prices for their children, and several complained that the ''Night on Bald Mountain'' segment had frightened them.<ref name=thom-162 /> There were also a few negative reactions that were more political in nature, especially since the film's release happened at a time when [[Nazi Germany]] reigned supreme in Europe. One review of the film in this manner, written by [[Dorothy Thompson]] for ''The New York Herald Tribune'' on November 25, 1940, was especially harsh. Thompson claimed that she "left the theater in a condition bordering on nervous breakdown," because the film was a "remarkable nightmare." Thompson went on to compare the film to rampant Nazism, which she described as "the abuse of power" and "the perverted betrayal of the best instincts." Thompson also claimed that the film depicted nature as being "titanic" while man was only "a moving lichen on the stone of time." She concluded that the film was "cruel", "brutal and brutalizing", and a negative "caricature of the Decline of the West". In fact, Thompson claimed that she was so distraught by the film that she even walked out of it before she saw the two last segments, ''Night on Bald Mountain'' and ''Ave Maria'', because she did not want to be subject to any more of the film's "brutalization".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Minority Report|first=Dorothy|last=Thompson|date=November 25, 1940|newspaper=The New York Herald Tribune|publisher=New York Tribune Inc.}}</ref>

'''Current criticism'''

''Fantasia'' holds a 96% "fresh" rating based on a sample of 50 reviews, with an average score of 8.6 out of 10 on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], a website which [[Review aggregator|aggregates film reviews]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fantasia/ |title=Fantasia (1940) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref> Its consensus<U+2014>"A landmark in animation and a huge influence on the medium of [[music video]], Disney's ''Fantasia'' is a relentlessly inventive blend of the classics with phantasmagorical images". ''[[TV Guide]]'' awarded the film four stars, calling it "the most ambitious animated feature ever to come out of the Disney studios", noting how the film "integrates famous works of classical music with wildly uneven but extraordinarily imaginative visuals that run the gamut from dancing hippos to the purely abstract".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/fantasia/review/114346|title=Fantasia|publisher=''TV Guide''|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' rated the film four stars out of four, and noted that throughout ''Fantasia'', "Disney pushes the edges of the envelope".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19901005/REVIEWS/10050304/1023 |title=Fantasia |publisher= RogerEbert.com |work=Chicago Sun-Times |first= Roger |last=Ebert |accessdate=February 28, 2011 |date= October 5, 1990 }}</ref> However, ''Empire'' magazine only rated it 2 stars out of 5 (poor), concluding "this is a very patchy affair - while some of the animated pieces work, others come across as downright insane".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/review.asp?FID=967|title=Fantasia|publisher=''Empire''|accessdate=February, 28 2014}}</ref> Perucci Ferraiuolo in his book ''Disney and the Bible: A Scriptural Critique of the Magic Kingdom'' considers the final sequence of the film, with Chernabog as the embodiment of Satan to be the "complete antithesis of the God of the Bible", dismissing the film as "an almost total glorification of witchcraft, sorcery and Satanism set to classical music." <ref>Pinsky, p. 38</ref> Remarks have also been made about ''Fantasia'' not being a children's film. Mark I. Pinksy considers ''Fantasia'' to the be one of the more problematic of Disney's animated features in that it was intended as much as for adults as children and not what people had come to expect.<ref>Pinsky, p. 33</ref>

=== Controversies ===
In the late 1960s, four shots from ''The Pastoral Symphony'' were removed that depicted two characters in a racially-stereotyped manner.

In May 1992, the Philadelphia Orchestra Association filed a lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company and [[Buena Vista Home Video]].

== Additional material ==
Disney had wanted ''Fantasia'' to be an ongoing project, with a new edition being released every few years.<ref name="Pegolotti, p. 249">Pegolotti, p. 249.</ref> His plan was to substitute one of the original segments with a new one as it was complete, so the viewer would always see a new version of the film.<ref name=15facts /> From January to August 1941, story material was developed based on additional pieces, including ''[[Ride of the Valkyries]]'' by [[Richard Wagner]], ''[[The Swan of Tuonela]]'' by [[Jean Sibelius]], ''[[Invitation to the Dance (Weber)|Invitation to the Dance]]'' by [[Carl Maria von Weber]], ''[[Flight of the Bumblebee]]'' by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]],<ref name=la1990 /><ref name=15facts /> which was later adapted into the ''Bumble Boogie'' segment in ''[[Melody Time]]'' (1948), and there was even consideration for a segment inspired by the Polka and Fugue from ''[[Schwanda the Bagpiper]]'' by [[Jarom<U+00ED>r Weinberger]]. The film's disappointing initial box office performance and the USA's entry into World War II brought an end to these plans.<ref>{{cite web|author=By Michael - February 8th, 2011 |url=http://progresscityusa.com/2011/02/08/future-fantasias-1940/#more-4854 |title=Future Fantasias, 1940 &#124; Progress City, U.S.A. |publisher=Progress City, U.S.A. |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2011-08-14}}</ref> Taylor had prepared introductions for ''[[The Firebird]]'' by Stravinsky, ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La Mer]]'' by [[Claude Debussy]], ''Adventures in a Perambulator'' by [[John Alden Carpenter]], ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'' by [[Richard Strauss]], and ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' by Mussorgsky "to have them for the future in case we decided to make any one of them".<ref name="Pegolotti, p. 249"/><ref>Pegolotti, p. 382</ref>

''Clair de Lune'' was another segment that was part of the film's original program. After being completely animated, it was cut out of the final film to shorten its already long running time. The segment featured two [[egrets]] flying through the [[Everglades]] on a moonlit night. The sequence was later edited and re-scored for the ''Blue Bayou'' segment in ''[[Make Mine Music]]'' (1946). A [[workprint]] of the original was discovered and ''Clair de Lune'' was restored in 1992, complete with the original soundtrack of Stokowski with the Philadelphia Orchestra. It was included as a bonus feature in ''The Fantasia Anthology'' DVD in 2000.<ref name=2000dvd/>

In 1980, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that animators [[Wolfgang Reitherman]] and Mel Shaw had begun work on ''Musicana'', "an ambitious concept mixing jazz, classical music, myths, modern art and more, following the old ''Fantasia'' format".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Warga|first=Wayne|title=Disney Films: Chasing the Changing Times|work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 26, 1980}}</ref> Animation historian Charles Solomon wrote that development took place between 1982 and 1983, which combined "ethnic tales from around the world with the music of the various countries".
