'''''The Heat''''' is the third studio album by American recording artist [[Toni Braxton]]. Released in the United States on April 25, 2000 by [[LaFace Records]], the album marked Braxton's departure from her [[ballad]]s in favor of a more [[urban contemporary|urban]] sound. Most of the songs (including the nearly instrumental "The Art of Love") were written and produced by Braxton and her husband Keri Lewis (a former member of [[Mint Condition]]), two ballads were penned by [[Diane Warren]], and collaborations featured rappers [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Lisa Lopes|Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes]].

''The Heat'' opened at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart selling 194,448 units its first week. It was certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) on October 13, 2000, with sales of over 2.2 million copies within the U.S. Additionally, the album was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Album|Best R&B Album]] at the [[43rd Grammy Awards|2001 Grammy Awards]], while lead single "[[He Wasn't Man Enough]]" won for [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance|Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]] and was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]].

== Background ==
The album's first single, "[[He Wasn't Man Enough]]", was written and produced by [[Rodney Jerkins]]. It's faster than Braxton's usual fare, featuring Jerkins' taut beats and harp. In the song, she warns a female friend not to marry a man the singer knows all too well. The title track "The Heat" was co-written by [[Keri Lewis]] and was described as "an infectious mid-tempo groove."<ref name="popmatters"/> "[[Spanish Guitar (song)|Spanish Guitar]]" was written by [[Diane Warren]] and it's a "latin-ballad". It was described as an "[[Un-Break My Heart]]" clone.<ref name="popmatters"/> The fourth track "[[Just Be a Man About It]]" is a telephone breakup song, with Toni once again questioning the status of a partner<U+2019>s manhood and [[Dr. Dre]] playing the wayward lover breaking the news to her. "Gimme Some" features [[Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes]] and it's an [[R&B]]/summer "jerky funker" track. "I'm Still Breathing" is another song written by [[Diane Warren]] and it was criticized for being an "overly dramatic" ballad.

The seventh track "Fairy Tale" was co-written and produced by [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]] and it's an "acoustic piece". The eighth track "The Art of Love" features no discernible lyrics and lets her play [[Barry White]], "luxuriating orgasmically over undulating rhythms" and "delivers only sighs, moans and pillow talk." The speedy rhythms of "Speaking in Tongues" reflect the character's neurotic thinking. The song is a sensual affair with warm harmonies. The tenth track "[[Maybe (Toni Braxton song)|Maybe]]" has rapid-fire lyrics, informed by [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]] vocal rhythms and was considered a "lacklustre", while the eleventh track "You've Been Wrong" was considered "plodding". The twelfth and final track "Never Just For a Ring" finds Braxton questioning her lovers lack of fidelity the song features the embittered choral hook <U+201C>Why?, when?, where?, how?, who?, what?", made you go off and do this crazy thing.
