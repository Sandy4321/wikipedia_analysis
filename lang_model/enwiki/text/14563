'''Sir William Robert Patrick "Robin" Knox-Johnston''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve|RD and bar]] (born 17 March 1939) is an English sailor. In 1968 he became the first man to perform a single-handed non-stop [[circumnavigation]] of the [[globe]] and was the second winner of the [[Jules Verne Trophy]] (together with [[Peter Blake (yachtsman)|Sir Peter Blake]]). For this he was awarded with Blake the [[International Sailing Federation|ISAF]] Yachtsman of the Year award. In 2006 he became at 67 the oldest yachtsman to complete a round the world solo voyage in the [[VELUX 5 Oceans Race]].

==Life==

===Early life===
He was born in [[Putney]] in [[London]] and was educated at the [[Berkhamsted School|Berkhamsted Boys school]]. From 1957 to 1965 he served in the [[British Merchant Navy|Merchant Navy]] and the [[Royal Naval Reserve]]. In 1965 he sailed his William Atkins design ketch ''[[Suhaili]]'' from [[Mumbai|Bombay]] to [[England]]. Due to a lack of money he had to interrupt his voyage for work in [[South Africa]] and was only able to complete it in 1967.   In 1968 he was the third of 9 sailors who attempted to achieve a solo non-stop circumnavigation of the world in the Sunday Times Golden Globe race, and the only one to complete the voyage.<ref>{{cite book| author=Robin Knox-Johnston| title=A World of My Own| publisher=Cassell & Co Ltd| year=1969 | isbn=0-304-93473-9| oclc=76958}}</ref>

===Family===
In 1962 he married Suzanne (Sue), whom he had known from the age of 8 and they had one daughter, Sara, who was born in Bombay whilst he was at sea. She left him when he proposed taking her and the child back to England in his new boat ''Suhaili'', and they were divorced in 1967.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robin Knox Johnston|title=Force of Nature|year=2007}}</ref> However, in 1972 they remarried and now have five grandchildren. She died in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.robinknox-johnston.co.uk|title = Sir Robin Knox-Johnston|accessdate =2009-06-02}}</ref>

==Circumnavigation of the Earth==
[[Image:GoldenGlobeRaceRoute.png|right|250px|left|The route of the '''Golden Globe Race'''.]]
On 14 June 1968  Robin Knox-Johnston left [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in his 32-foot (9.8-meter) boat ''Suhaili'', one of the smallest boats to enter the [[Sunday Times Golden Globe Race]]. Despite losing his self-steering gear off Australia, he rounded [[Cape Horn]] on 17 January 1969, 20 days before his closest competitor [[Bernard Moitessier]], who subsequently abandoned the race and sailed on to Tahiti. The other seven competitors dropped out at various stages, leaving Knox-Johnston to win the race and become officially the first man to circumnavigate the globe non-stop and single-handed on 22 April 1969, the day he returned to Falmouth. Knox-Johnston donated his prize money for fastest competitor to the family of [[Donald Crowhurst]], who committed suicide after attempting to fake a round the world voyage.

In recognition of his achievement, he was created a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]].

===Further exploits===
In 1970 (with Leslie Williams) and in 1974 (with Gerry Boxall) Robin Knox-Johnston won the two-handed Round Britain Race. Robin Knox-Johnston, Les Williams and their crew, which [[Peter Blake (yachtsman)|Peter Blake]] was also part of, took [[line honours]] of the 1971 Cape Town to Rio Race. Les Williams and Robin Knox-Johnston jointly skippered (Peter Blake crewmember again) maxi yacht [[Condor of Bermuda|Heath's Condor]] in the 1977 [[Whitbread Round the World Race]]. They took the line honours in the second and fourth leg, the ones which Robin Knox-Johnston skippered.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Robin Knox-Johnston and Peter Blake (who both acted as co-skippers) won the [[Jules Verne Trophy]] for the fastest circumnavigation in 1994. Their time was 74 days 22 hours 18 minutes and 22 seconds. It was their second attempt to win this prize after their first one in 1992 had to be aborted when their [[catamaran]] ''Enza'' hit an object which tore a hole in the starboard hull.

From 1992 to 2001 he was President of the [[Sail Training Association]]. During his tenure the money was collected to replace the STA<U+2019>s vessels ''Sir Winston Churchill'' and ''Malcolm Miller'' by the new, larger [[brig]]s ''[[ Prince William (ship)|Prince William]]'' and ''[[Stavros S Niarchos (ship)|Stavros S. Niarchos]]''. He was trustee of the [[National Maritime Museum]] at [[Greenwich]] from 1992 to 2002 and still is trustee of the National Maritime Museum&nbsp;<U+2013> [[Cornwall]] at Falmouth, where ''Suhaili'' is berthed today. The yacht has been refitted and took part in the Round the Island Race in June 2005.

He was created a [[knight bachelor]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|author = Sir Robin Knox-Johnston|url = http://www.robinknox-johnston.co.uk/da/20074|title = Sir Robin Knox-Johnston's CV|accessdate =2007-08-24}}</ref>

In 1996 Robin established the first [[Clipper Round the World Yacht Race]] and has since worked with the Clipper Ventures company as Chairman to progress the race to higher levels every year.<ref>{{cite web|author = Sir Robin Knox-Johnston|url = http://www.clipperroundtheworld.com/index.php/the_hatch/sir_robins_blog/|title = Sir Robin Knox-Johnston's Blog|accessdate =2007-08-24}}</ref> It is perhaps his greatest achievement to have introduced so many people to competitive sailing via their involvement in Clipper Ventures.

He completed his second solo circumnavigation of the world in the yacht ''SAGA Insurance ''on 4 May 2007, finishing in 4th place in the [[VELUX 5 Oceans Race]].<ref>{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/6623703.stm|title = Sailing legend crosses the line|publisher = BBC|date =2007-05-04|accessdate =2007-08-24}}</ref> At 68 he was the oldest competitor in the race.<ref>{{cite news|author = John Elliott|url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2168656.html|title = Old man of sea Knox-Johnston takes on world|work = The Sunday Times|date =2006-05-07|accessdate =2006-07-02}}</ref>

In late 2008/early 2009 he took part in a new BBC program called ''Top Dogs: Adventures in War, Sea and Ice''. The program sees him unite with fellow British legends Sir [[Ranulph Fiennes]], the adventurer, and [[John Simpson (journalist)|John Simpson]], the BBC World Affairs Editor. The team go on three trips, each experiencing each other's adventure field. The first episode, aired on 27 March 2009, saw Robin, [[Ranulph Fiennes|Fiennes]] and [[John Simpson (journalist)|Simpson]] go on a potentially very dangerous news-gathering trip to Afghanistan. The team reported from the legendary [[Khyber Pass]] and infamous [[Tora Bora]] mountain complex. The three also undertake a voyage around [[Cape Horn]] and an expedition hauling sledges across the deep-frozen [[Frobisher Bay]] in the far north of Canada.

Having served two years as President of The [[Cruising Association]], Sir Robin is now the association's patron.
