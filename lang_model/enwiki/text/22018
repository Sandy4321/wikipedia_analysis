'''Dex One Corporation''' was an American marketing company providing online, mobile and print search marketing via their DexKnows.com website, print [[yellow pages]] [[Telephone directory|directories]] and pay-per-click ad networks in the U.S.

In April 2013 Dex One merged with [[SuperMedia]], and the combined company now does business as [[Dex Media]].

==History==
Dex One Corporation was formed in February 2010.  It was previously the R. H. Donnelley Company, which was founded in 1886 by Reuben H. Donnelley, son of [[RR Donnelley]] founder Richard R. Donnelley, as The Chicago Directory Company. Donnelley primarily contracted with The Chicago Telephone Company to publish telephone directories for Chicago Telephone customers. In 1906, however, Donnelley would venture outside [[Chicago]], contracting with [[Bell System]] firms such as [[New York Telephone]], [[Wisconsin Telephone]], and [[Cincinnati Bell|Cincinnati Suburban Telephone Co.]]

In 1917, The Reuben H. Donnelley Company was incorporated and moved to [[New York City]], retaining some offices in [[Chicago]]. In 1925, Donnelley died, leaving behind his company which continued to contract with the [[Bell System]] to publish telephone directories.

In 1961, [[Dun & Bradstreet|Dun & Bradstreet Corp]] merged with R.H. Donnelley becoming a wholly owned subsidiary.

===Partnerships===
Following its merger with [[Dun & Bradstreet|D&B]], the company began a series of partnerships with several telephone companies to publish directories. Around this time, competition started with other phone companies to provide directories.

From 1980 to 1985, R.H. Donnelley began a partnership with United Telephone ([[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]]), called Uni-Don, to publish telephone directories to customers in central [[Florida]].

In 1986, it contracted with [[NYNEX]] to become its directory sales agent. The same year, R.H. Donnelley started publishing directories in [[Delaware]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Pennsylvania]] in competition with [[Bell Atlantic]], although a lot of these areas were later sold off to [[Yellow Book (directory)|Yellow Book]].

In 1988, it formed Cen-Don with Centel (now part of [[CenturyLink]]) to publish telephone directories in [[Florida]], [[Illinois]], [[Iowa]], [[Minnesota]], [[Nevada]], [[North Carolina]], [[Ohio]], and [[Virginia]]. Venture One was formed with [[Southwestern Bell Corporation]], which published directories in competition with [[Bell Atlantic]] in [[Baltimore, MD]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]

In 1990, DonTech was formed with [[Ameritech]] to publish telephone directories in Illinois and northwest [[Indiana]].

===Public offering===
On July 1, 1998, [[Dun & Bradstreet|D&B]] spun off R. H. Donnelley into a separate, publicly traded company beginning to trade on the [[NYSE]] under the "RHD" symbol.

In 2002, R.H. Donnelley acquired Sprint Directory Publishing, the publishing unit of [[Sprint Nextel Corporation|Sprint Corp]].

R.H. Donnelley Publishing & Advertising, Inc., the division of [[R. H. Donnelley]] that publishes directories under the EMBARQ Yellow Pages name, was acquired from the [[Sprint Corporation]] in 2003 as Sprint Publishing & Advertising, Inc., Directories America, Inc. and Centel Directories, LLC.

In 2004, R.H. Donnelley acquired the directory publishing business of [[SBC Communications]] in [[Illinois]] and northwest [[Indiana]], along with the SBC interest in DonTech. As a result, R.H. Donnelley gained a 50-year licensing agreement to use the SBC Yellow Pages name on all directories published for SBC Illinois customers. Following the [[AT&T]] merger, the directories were known as "AT&T Yellow Pages published by R.H. Donnelley".

In 2006, following its spinoff from [[Sprint Nextel]], R.H. Donnelley directories in former Sprint areas became the [[Embarq]] Yellow Pages.

In 2006, R.H. Donnelley completed its acquisition of [[Dex Media (Dex One)|Dex Media]], which had been spun off from [[Qwest]] in 2002-2003. Following the acquisition, R.H. Donnelley became the third largest directory publisher in the [[United States]].

In January 2007, R.H. Donnelley bought Local Launch Search Marketing<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.locallaunch.com |title=Yellow Pages Online, Phone Book & Business Directory &#124; DexKnows |publisher=Locallaunch.com |date=2012-09-21 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref> to add strength to its online marketing division for its yellow pages.

In July 2007, R.H. Donnelley bought [[Business.com]].<ref name="BusAcq">{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=74700&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1031378|accessdate=2007-10-17|title=R.H. Donnelley to Acquire Business.com Inc.|publisher=Phx.corporate-ir.net}}</ref>

On December 31, 2008, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) suspended trading of R.H. Donnelley because the company's market capitalization was less than $25 million for 30 consecutive trading days, which failed to meet the Exchange's listing standards. As a result of this suspension, R.H. Donnelley began trading its common stock over-the-counter (OTC) on the [[Pink Sheets LLC|Pink Sheets]] beginning on January 2, 2009, under the symbol "RHDC".<ref name="Delist">{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=74700&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1240022|accessdate=2009-01-16|title=R.H. Donnelley Stock to Trade Over the Counter}}</ref>

In June 2009, R.H. Donnelley Corporation and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://domainnamewire.com/2009/06/02/businesscom-owner-files-for-bankruptcy/|title=Business.com Owner Files for Bankruptcy|work=Domain Name Wire|date=June 2, 2009|accessdate=2009-06-18}}</ref>  In February 2010, R.H. Donnelley Corporation emerged from bankruptcy as Dex One Corporation.

On February 1, 2010, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) started trading 50 million Dex One Corporation shares under the "DEXO" ticker symbol.

==Today==
{{Advert|date=May 2013}}
Dex One Corporation is a leading marketing services company that helps local businesses reach their potential customers. Locally based marketing consultants offer personalized marketing consulting services and exposure across a broad network of local marketing products, including print, online and mobile yellow pages and search solutions, as well as major search engines.

The company cut over 500 jobs in 2011 as revenues decreased, hurt mainly by a 20 percent yearly decline in print directory sales. However, online ad bookings jumped 29 percent in third quarter 2011 and 34 percent in fourth quarter 2011, compared to a year earlier. The company hired sales people who knew how to effectively take advantage of online capabilities, though that area would not make up for the slowdown for print directories.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.newsobserver.com/business/investors-are-encouraged-as-dex-cuts-costs|title=Investors are encouraged as Dex cuts costs|last=Ranii|first=David|work=[[News & Observer]]|date=2012-03-01|accessdate=2012-03-02}}</ref>

==Merger with SuperMedia==
On August 21, 2012, Dex One and [[SuperMedia]] announced a stock for stock merger transaction. The merger closed on April 30, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ir.supermedia.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=205085&p=RssLanding&cat=news&id=1813317 |title=Dex One and SuperMedia Complete Merger, Move Forward Together as Dex Media|publisher=http://ir.supermedia.com/|accessdate=2013-05-01}}</ref> The new company is called Dex Media (not to be confused with the original [[Dex Media (Dex One)|Dex Media]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://my.supermedia.com/CammsServlet/pressrelease/12868.pdf |title=DEX ONE AND SUPERMEDIA WILL COMBINE TO CREATE A NATIONAL PROVIDER OF SOCIAL, LOCAL AND MOBILE MARKETING SOLUTIONS|publisher=My.supermedia.com|accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref>

The merger reunites directory operations formerly part of [[Ameritech]] in [[Illinois]], [[Verizon]], and [[Qwest]], all of which haven't been under common ownership since the [[Bell System divestiture]] in 1983.
