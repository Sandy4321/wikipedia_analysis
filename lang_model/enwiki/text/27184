The '''Algeciras campaign''' (sometimes known as the '''Battle''' or '''Battles of Algeciras''') was an attempt by a French naval squadron from [[Toulon]] under Contre-Admiral [[Charles Linois]] to join a French and Spanish fleet at [[Cadiz]] during June and July 1801 during the [[French Revolutionary War]] prior to a planned operation against either [[Egypt]] or [[Portugal]]. To reach Cadiz, the French squadron had to pass the British naval base at [[Gibraltar]], which housed the squadron tasked with [[blockade|blockading]] the Spanish port under Rear-Admiral [[Sir James Saumarez]]. After a successful voyage between Toulon and Gibraltar, in which a number of British vessels were captured, the squadron anchored at [[Algeciras]], a fortified port city within sight of Gibraltar across [[Algeciras Bay]]. On 6 July 1801, Saumarez attacked the anchored squadron, in the [[First Battle of Algeciras]]. Although severe damage was inflicted on all three French [[ships of the line]], none could be successfully captured and the British were forced to withdraw without [[HMS Hannibal (1786)|HMS ''Hannibal'']], which had grounded and was subsequently seized by the French.

In the aftermath of the first battle, both sides set about making urgent repairs and calling up reinforcements. On 9 July a fleet of five Spanish and one French ship of the line and several frigates arrived from Cadiz to safely escort Linois's squadron to the Spanish port, and the British at Gibraltar redoubled their efforts to restore their squadron to fighting service. In the evening of 12 July the French and Spanish fleet sailed from Algeciras, and the British force followed them, catching the trailing ships in the [[Second Battle of Algeciras]] and opening fire at 11:20. A confused night action followed, in which the British ship [[HMS Superb (1798)|HMS ''Superb'']] cut through the disorganised allied rearguard, followed by the rest of Saumarez's force. In the confusion one French ship was captured, a Spanish [[frigate]] sank and two huge 112-gun Spanish [[first rate]]s collided and exploded, killing as many as 1,700 men. The following morning the French ship [[French ship Formidable (1795)|''Formidable'']] was came under attack at the rear of the combined squadron, but successfully drove off pursuit and reached Cadiz safely.

Ultimately the French and Spanish fleets were successful in their aim of uniting at Cadiz, albeit after heavy losses, but they were still under blockade and in no position to realise either the Egyptian or Portuguese plans. The two battles, "generally regarded as a single linked battle",<ref name="NM408">Mostert, p. 408</ref> proved decisive in cementing British control of the Mediterranean Sea and condemning the French army in Egypt to defeat, totally unsupported by reinforcements from the French Navy.

==Background==
On 1 August 1798, a British fleet surprised and almost completely destroyed the French Mediterranean Fleet at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in the aftermath of the successful French invasion of [[Egypt]]. This immediately reversed the strategic situation in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], eliminating the French fleet based at [[Toulon]] as a significant threat and granting the British and their allies in the [[War of the Second Coalition]] naval dominance in the region.<ref name="RG58">Gardiner, p. 58</ref> Over the next three years, British and allied squadrons enforced [[blockade]]s against all significant French and Spanish naval bases in the region, including [[Alexandria]], [[Corfu]] and [[Malta]] but particularly the significant harbours at Toulon and [[Cadiz]]. This drastically limited the movement of French troops and military materials across the Mediterranean, with the result that Malta and Corfu were captured and the army in Egypt was steadily reduced in size and effectiveness.<ref name="RG16">Gardiner, p. 16</ref>

In January 1801, in an attempt to increase the size of the French Mediterranean Fleet and to reinforce the beleaguered Egyptian garrison, [[First Consul]] [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] ordered a squadron of seven [[ships of the line]] to sail from [[Brest, France|Brest]] on the [[Atlantic]] coast to the Mediterranean under Rear-Admiral [[Honor<U+00E9> Ganteaume]].<ref name="WJ87">James, p. 87</ref> The squadron made three unsuccessful attempts to reach Egypt, eventually retiring to Toulon in late July 1801. During the final effort, [[Ganteaume's expeditions of 1801|Ganteaume's squadron]] sailed from Toulon on 27 April 1801 with instructions to briefly secure local naval supremacy around [[Elba]] to allow a seabourne invasion to go ahead, before travelling on into the Eastern Mediterranean.<ref name="RW158">Woodman, p. 158</ref> During these operations, Ganteaume discovered that several ships in his force were dangerously undermanned, and therefore decided to consolidate his crews and send three ships of the line, [[French ship Formidable (1795)|''Formidable'']], [[French ship Indomptable (1789)|''Indomptable'']] and [[French ship Tyrannicide (1793)|''Desaix'']], and the [[frigate]] [[French frigate Cr<U+00E9>ole|''Cr<U+00E9>ole'']] back to Toulon.<ref name="WJ93">James, p. 93</ref>

The presence of this force at Toulon enabled the French to plan a secondary operation using Ganteaume's new arrivals. A deal had been brokered earlier in the year between Bonaparte and [[Charles IV of Spain]] for the Spanish government to provide six ships of the line from the Cadiz fleet to the [[French Navy]].<ref name="RW161"/> Orders were given that the new squadron at Cadiz was to be joined by the three ships of the line detached from Ganteaume's squadron, as well as the frigate [[French frigate Muiron|''Muiron'']] under the overall command of Rear-Admiral [[Charles Linois]].<ref name="WLC459"/> This force of nine French ships, accompanied by six promised vessels from the Spanish fleet, was then to fulfil one of two mooted plans: the first was a large scale attack on [[Lisbon]]. Portugal and Spain were engaged in the [[War of the Oranges]] and Lisbon was a major British trading port: the French admiral [[Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen-Tr<U+00E9>marec|Kerguelen]] had estimated some years earlier that an attack there could seize as much as "2 millions" of British goods and shipping.<ref name="WJ112"/> The other planned operation, adopted following the end of the War of the Oranges on 2 June, was for the force to resupply Egypt using soldiers stationed at Italian ports.<ref name="WJ112">James, p. 112</ref> To facilitate the transfer of the Spanish ships to French control, Napoleon ordered Contre-Admiral [[Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley]] to sail to Cadiz. Le Pelley arrived at the Spanish port on 13 June in the frigates [[French frigate Libre (1796)|''Libre'']] and [[French frigate Indienne (1796)|''Indienne'']] with sailors to begin manning the newly purchased ships and Commodore [[Julien le Ray]] to command them. His arrival was noted by the British blockade squadron off Cadiz under Rear-Admiral [[Sir James Saumarez]], a veteran of the [[Battle of the Nile]] and one of [[Horatio Nelson|Lord Nelson]]'s famous "[[Nelsonic Band of Brothers|Band of Brothers]]":<ref name="ODNBSaumarez">{{cite journal |last= Sainsbury|first= A.

==Linois's voyage==

{{see also|Order of Battle in the Algeciras campaign}}
Linois sailed from Toulon on 13 June 1801 with three ships of the line and one frigate carrying 1,560 soldiers under Brigadier-General Devaux.<ref name="WLC458">Clowes, p. 458</ref> Ganteaume's earlier expedition was still in the Eastern Mediterranean, and so the British blockade force under [[Sir John Borlase Warren]] detailed to watch Toulon was instead off Malta hoping to intercept Ganteaume on his return.<ref name="WJ113">James, p. 113</ref> Therefore the only British ships on hand when Linois emerged from the port were a few frigates, which were easily chased away by the larger warships of the French squadron. Linois's passage was slow, facing winds from the southwest that delayed his squadron so that by the 30 June they were only off [[Cabo de Gata-N<U+00ED>jar Natural Park|Cape de Gata]] in the [[Alboran Sea]]. On 1 July they were spotted from Gibraltar, although the only warship there was the 14-gun [[HMS Calp<U+00E9> (1800)|HMS ''Calp<U+00E9>'']] under Captain [[George Heneage Dundas]] which was unable to influence their advance. Instead, Captain Dundas ordered Lieutenant Richard Janvarin to take a boat and communicate with the Cadiz blockade force of seven ships of the line, under Saumarez.<ref name="WLC459">Clowes, p. 459</ref>

Linois passed Gibraltar on 3 July and during the night discovered the 14-gun [[brig]] [[HMS Speedy (1782)|HMS ''Speedy'']] a short distance ahead. Linois's squadron had captured a number of merchant vessels during their voyage but this was their first warship, and although it was no match for size, ''Speedy'' was an infamous vessel under the command of Captain [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]]. Cochrane had spent the last year raiding the Spanish coast with great success, taking or destroying more than 50 ships including the celebrated [[Action of 6 May 1801]] in which Cochrane had attacked and captured the far larger Spanish [[privateer]] [[frigate]] [[Spanish frigate El Gamo|''Gamo'']] off [[Barcelona]].<ref name="ODNBCochrane">{{cite journal |last= Lambert|first= Andrew|authorlink= Andrew Lambert  |coauthors= |year= |month= |title=Cochrane, Thomas|journal=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], {{ODNBsub}} |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5757 |accessdate=13 September 2010 |quote= }}</ref> Cochrane's initial belief that the strange ships were Spanish treasure vessels caused him to bring ''Speedy'' closer to the ships and by the time he realised his error escape was impossible.<ref name="RLA92">Adkins, p. 92</ref> Rather than surrender however, Cochrane threw all of his guns and excessive weight overboard and manoeuvered his ship to avoid coming into range of the French [[broadside]]s. He then attempted to cut directly between the approaching ''Formidable'' and ''Desaix'', the small target avoiding the concentrated fire of the French ships and pulling into open water. At this, Commodore [[Jean-Anne Christy-Palli<U+00E8>re]] on ''Desaix'' swung his ship about and pursued, several shots damaging ''Speedy''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sails and rigging. As ''Speedy'' slowed, ''Desaix'' overtook the small brig and fired a full broadside at close range.<ref name="RH58">Harvey, p. 58</ref> This was fired as the French ship was on the uproll and therefore missed the deck entirely and failed to cause a single casualty. It did however tear away the remaining rigging and sails, leaving ''Speedy'' unmanageable. Rather than suffer another broadside, Cochrane surrendered his ship and was taken aboard ''Desaix'', where Christy-Palli<U+00E8>re acknowledged his brave defence by refusing to accept Cochrane's surrendered sword with the words "I will not accept the sword of an officer who has for so many hours struggled against impossibility".<ref name="RH59">Harvey, p. 59</ref> From Cochrane, Linois learned of Saumarez's presence ahead of him and, knowing that his presence would have been reported by the garrison at Gibraltar,<ref name="JM32">Musteen, p. 32</ref> his squadron returned eastwards around Cabrita Point and came to anchor at [[Algeciras]], a fortified Spanish port which lay directly opposite and within sight of Gibraltar across [[Algeciras Bay]] on the 4 July.<ref name="RW161">Woodman, p. 161</ref>

Off Cadiz, the squadron under Saumarez was notified of Linois's arrival by Lieutenant Janvarin at 02:00 on 5 July and immediately turned back towards Gibraltar, [[tack (sailing)|tacking]] against the wind. The frigate [[HMS Thames (1758)|HMS ''Thames'']] was detached and sent {{convert|18|nmi|km}} westwards to the mouth of the [[Guadalquivir River]] to collect [[HMS Superb (1798)|HMS ''Superb'']] under Captain [[Richard Goodwin Keats]], which was blockading the river with the small brig [[HMS Pasley|HMS ''Pasley'']].<ref name="WLC460">Clowes, p. 460</ref> Keats did follow Saumarez back to Algeciras, and was in distantly in sight when the battle commenced, but on hearing an inaccurate report from an American merchant ship that Linois had escaped the bay and was at sea once more, Keats reasoned that the French must be returning to Toulon and that he would be in a better position returning to the blockade of Cadiz than attempting to join Saumarez's chase.<ref name="WJ124">James, p. 124</ref> The [[lugger]] [[HMS Plymouth|HMS ''Plymouth'']] was also detached to Lisbon with despatches for the [[Admiralty]] informing them of Saumarez's intentions.<ref name="JM33"/> The British admiral, knowing that Linois was still anchored in the bay, intended to descend on Algeciras immediately but was beset by a series of calm spells that prevented his squadron from doing more than slowly drifting eastwards away from ''Superb'' and towards Algeciras. It was not until the morning of 6 July therefore that Saumarez was in a position to attack the anchored French squadron.<ref name="NM404">Mostert, p. 404</ref> In anticipation of Saumarez's arrival, Linois had formed his squadron into a strong defensive position, the three ships of the line anchored in a line north to south across in shallow waters off the mouth of Algeciras harbour, protected by Spanish forts at either extremity and around the town itself, where ''Murion'' was anchored in shallower water. Linois led the line himself in ''Formidable'', but despatched parties from the crews of the ships of the line to augment the Spanish defences.<ref name="NM404"/>

==First Battle of Algeciras==

{{main|First Battle of Algeciras}}
At 07:00, Saumarez ordered his squadron to advance into the bay without delay and engage the French directly, the attack to be led by Captain [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Samuel Hood]] in HMS ''Venerable''. Hood was delayed by light winds however, and the first ship into action was [[HMS Pomp<U+00E9>e (1793)|HMS ''Pomp<U+00E9>e'']] under Captain [[Charles Sterling (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Sterling]], which attacked the anchored French ships in succession before anchoring close to ''Formidable''.<ref name="WJ115">James, p. 115</ref> ''Pomp<U+00E9>e'' was followed by [[HMS Audacious (1785)|HMS ''Audacious'']], Saumarez's flagship [[HMS Caesar (1793)|HMS ''Caesar'']] and [[HMS Hannibal (1786)|HMS ''Hannibal'']], with ''Venerable'' and  [[HMS Spencer (1800)|HMS ''Spencer'']] participating at a greater distance due to the unreliable wind.<ref name="WLC461">Clowes, p. 461</ref> By 10:00 both squadrons were fully engaged except for ''Pomp<U+00E9>e'' at the head of the British line which had been caught by a current and swung so that the ship's bow was facing ''Formidable''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[broadside]], allowing Linois to [[raking fire|rake]] the British ship.<ref name="WJ116">James, p. 116</ref> Seeing the danger Sterling was in, Saumarez ordered Captain [[Solomon Ferris (Royal Navy officer)|Solomon Ferris]] to take ''Hannibal'' around the head of the French line and rake ''Formidable''. in the light wind, Ferris took almost an hour to reach the head of the lines, but as he turned inshore, ''Hannibal'' grounded on a shoal directly under the guns of the Spanish fort at ''Torre de Almirante''.<ref name="WLC463">Clowes, p. 463</ref>

Saumarez ordered his squadron's boats to assist ''Hannibal'' and ''Pomp<U+00E9>e'', both of which were trapped under heavy fire and unable to effectively respond.<ref name="WLC463"/> As he did so, Linois ordered his ships to cut their anchor cables and drift into the shallows, away from the becalmed British squadron. ''Formidable'' successfully completed the manoeuvre, but both ''Desaix'' and ''Indomptable'' grounded inshore, where they were exposed to heavy fire from Saumarez's ships, which had also cut their cables in an effort to close with their opponents.<ref name="WJ117">James, p. 117</ref> At 13:35 however, Saumarez recognised that his squadron was in danger of grounding directly under the fire of the Spanish batteries. With the squadron's boats either sunk or employed towing ''Pomp<U+00E9>e'' back to Gibraltar, there was no possibility of launching an [[amphibious operation]] against the Spanish forts and Saumarez reluctantly called the attack off, the remainder of the squadron retiring to Gibratar but leaving the stranded ''Hannibal'' in Algeciras Bay.<ref name="RG89">Gardiner, p. 89</ref>

''Hannibal'' had been exposed to the combined French and Spanish fire for four hours, and had lost two masts and more than 140 men killed and wounded. In an effort to preserve the lives of his crew, Ferris ordered his men to shelter below decks, but at 14:00 fires broke out on the ship and Ferris, isolated by Saumarez's withdrawal, surrendered his ship.<ref name="NM405">Mostert, p. 405</ref> French boarding parties extinguished the fires and rehung the struck [[Union Flag]] upside down to signify that ''Hannibal'' had surrendered. However, in the Royal Navy an inverted flag is a [[signal of distress]], and at least one British ship's boat was captured while attempting to bring assistance to Ferris before the misunderstanding was realised.<ref name="WLC464">Clowes, p. 464</ref>

The French victory had come at a heavy cost: more than 160 men were killed and 300 wounded and all three French ships had been severely damaged.{{Cref2|Note A}} Among the dead were the captains of both ''Formidable'' and ''Indomptable'', although Linois was unhurt.<ref name="WLC465">Clowes, p. 465</ref> The Spanish had suffered eleven men killed and five [[gunboats]] had been destroyed. The batteries and town had also been badly damaged in the fighting.<ref name="WJ119">James, p. 119</ref> British losses were also heavy, with more than 130 killed and more than 230 wounded, most of which had been lost on ''Hannibal'' and ''Pomp<U+00E9>e''. In addition to the loss of ''Hannibal'', ''Pomp<U+00E9>e'' was severely damaged and the remainder of the British squadron all required urgent repairs.<ref name="WLC464"/>

==Interlude==
Immediately following the battle, Linois used overland messangers to request the assistance of the Spanish fleet at Cadiz under Admiral [[Jose de Mazarredo y Salazar|Jose de Mazzaredo]].<ref name="RG91">Gardiner, p. 91</ref> Linois and Saumarez also embarked on a program of refitting and repairing their damaged squadrons in preparation for a resumption of the action. At Gibraltar, the wounded were transferred to the naval hospital and the dead buried in the gravesite later to be known as [[Trafalgar Cemetery]].<ref name="JM41">Musteen, p. 41</ref> Saumarez ordered that the most damaged of the surviving ships, ''Pomp<U+00E9>e'' and ''Caesar'', be laid up in dock and their crews distributed among the remaining ships to ensure that they could be repaired as rapidly as possible, a situation made necessary in part due to the seizure of many of Gibraltar's shipwrights in Algeciras Bay when they were sent to aid ''Hannibal'' in the last stages of the battle.<ref name="NM406">Mostert, p. 406</ref> The entire squadron needed extensive repairs, their requirements met by Captain [[Alexander Ball]], naval commissioner at Gibraltar.<ref name="JM43">Musteen, p. 43</ref> Captain [[Jahleel Brenton]] of ''Caesar'' protested this order and Saumarez permitted him to continue with repairs: ''Caesar''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s crew worked all day and in regular shifts throughout the night for the next week to ensure that when Saumarez sailed again, ''Caesar'' sailed with him, the crew having replaced the ship's damaged masts in just four days.<ref name="WJ125">James, p. 125</ref> Saumarez also sent a boat under a [[flag of truce]] in to Algeciras to arrange for the repatriation under [[parole]] of Ferris and his officers. Following a brief correspondence between Linois and the British admiral, the captured British officers, including Ferris and Cochrane, were sent to Gibraltar, later joined by the wounded British sailors captured on ''Hannibal''.<ref name="WJ122">James, p. 122</ref> Ferris was immediately sent to Britain on [[HMS Plymouth (1786)|HMS ''Plymouth'']] with despatches, to await the [[court-martial]] for the loss of his ship.<ref name="JM45">Musteen, p. 45</ref> He and his officers were completely exonerated.<ref name="WJ123">James, p. 123</ref>

Linois also began a programme of refloating and making extensive repairs to his ships, including the captured ''Hannibal'', which he renamed ''Annibal''. [[Jury masts]] were set up on the battered hulk, although such extensive repairs were required that when Linois sailed a week later the ship was still only just seaworthy, and was sent back to Algeciras.<ref name="WJ126">James, p. 126</ref> In Cadiz, despite Spanish hesitation, the messages from Linois coupled with strong representations from le Pelley prompted Mazzaredo to order a squadron to sea on the morning of 9 July, commanded by Vice-Admiral Don [[Juan Joaquin de Moreno]] and including two very large [[first rate]] ships of the line: [[Spanish ship Real Carlos|''Real Carlos'']] and [[Spanish ship San Hermengildo|''San Hermengildo'']], each mustering 112 guns.<ref name="WLC466">Clowes, p. 466</ref> The remainder of the squadron consisted of a 96-gun Spanish ship, an 80-gun Spanish ship, a 74-gun Spanish ship as well as the 74-gun ship [[French ship Saint Antoine (1800)|''Saint Antoine'']], which a few days earlier had been the Spanish ''San Antonio''. The first of the purchased ships of the line to be commissioned into the French Navy, ''Saint Antonine''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s crew was drawn from the men brought to Cadiz on the frigates ''Libre'' and ''Indienne'', supplemented by a number of Spanish sailors and commanded by Commodore Le Ray. Accompanying the squadron were the frigates ''Libre'', the Spanish [[Spanish frigate Sabina|''Sabina'']] and the French [[lugger]] [[French ship Vautour|''Vautour'']].<ref name="WJ126"/>

The departure of this combined squadron was observed by Captain Keats on ''Superb'', which after returning to Cadiz had retained station off the port with HMS ''Thames'' and HMS ''Pasley''. ''Thames'' was inshore searching a sezied American merchant ship, and witnessed the emergence of the squadron, retreating before four ships of the line that approached the British frigate. ''Superb'' was sighted shortly afterwards and also retreated before a ship of the line and two frigates, reconstituting his small squadron in the wake of Moreno's force.<ref name="JM42">Musteen, p. 42</ref> Keats immediately sent ''Pasley'' ahead to Gibraltar to warn Saumarez, the brig arriving at 15:00 closely followed by the main body of the combined squadron, from which ''Saint Antoine'' had detached during the departure from Cadiz and was following behind, shadowed by ''Superb''.<ref name="WLC466"/> Moreno's squadron anchored in Algeciras Bay, out of reach of the British batteries on Gibraltar and waited there for Linois to complete his repairs, ''Saint Antoine'' joining the squadron on the morning of 10 July.<ref name="RG92">Gardiner, p. 92</ref> Keats then brought his ships into Gibraltar, where efforts to repair the squadron were increased, with the knowledge that Moreno would soon be sailing to Cadiz with Linois squadron.<ref name="NM406"/> Saumarez, concerned by the size of the combined squadron, sent urgent messages to the Mediterranean Fleet under [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|Lord Keith]] in the Eastern Mediterranean requesting support in the belief that Moreno would be delayed at least two weeks due to the condition of Linois's ships.<ref name="JM43"/> Saumarez was wrong: Moreno planned to convoy the battered squadron the short distance to Cadiz as soon as they were seaworthy.

==Second battle of Algeciras==
{{main|Second Battle of Algeciras}}
[[File:La Marine-Pacini-118.png|thumb|HMS ''Superb'' sails silently off the Spanish fleet at Algeciras Bay, while the ''Hermenegildo'' and ''Real Carlos'' explode in the background after mistakenly firing on one other. Drawing by [[Antoine L<U+00E9>on Morel-Fatio]].]]
On the morning of 12 July the combined French and Spanish squadron put to sea, followed closely by the British squadron. Both sides took most of the day to assemble, hampered by light winds and damaged warships, but at 19:00 Moreno gave orders for his squadron to make all sail westwards towards the open ocean and Cadiz. Saumarez followed, but at 20:40, with night drawing in and the wind picking up, he instructed Keats to take ''Superb'', the fastest ship in his squadron, ahead and engage the rearguard of Moreno's force.<ref name="RW161">Woodman, p. 161</ref> At 23:20, Keats discovered the ''Real Carlos'' and pulled alongside, firing three broadsides into the Spanish ship that started a severe fire. ''Superb'' then pushed on towards ''Saint Antoine'' while ''Real Carlos'' drifted in darkness and confusion, encountering ''San Hermengildo'', the Spanish ships mistaking one another for an enemy and opening fire. ''Real Carlos'' then drifted into ''San Hermengildo'', the huge ships tangling together and the fire spreading from one to another until both were blazing wrecks in the darkness. They both exploded at 00:15 on 13 July, killing more than 1,700 men.<ref name="RG93">Gardiner, p. 93</ref> At some stage during the night, the independently sailing Spanish frigate [[Spanish frigate Perla|''Perla'']] sailed through the battle and was fatally damaged in the crossfire, sinking the next morning.<ref name="WJ354">James, p. 354</ref>

Keats meanwhile had engaged and defeated ''Saint Antoine'', forcing the wounded Commodore [[Julien le Ray]] to surrender following an action that had lasted just half an hour. Casualties on ''Saint Antoine'' were heavy, although ''Superb'' had just 15 men wounded. The rest of the British squadron, following up in the darkness, mistook ''Saint Antoine'' as being still active, and all fired on the ship as they passed, intending to catch the remainder of Moreno's squadron as it sailed northwest along the Spanish coastline.<ref name="WJ128">James, p. 128</ref> At 04:00 the ''Formidable'', now under the command of Captain [[Amable Troude]], was seen to the north in [[Conil de la Frontera|Conil Bay]] near [[Cape Trafalgar]] and Saumarez sent ''Venerable'' to chase the French ship, Hood accompanied by ''Thames'' under Captain [[Aiskew Hollis]]. At 05:15, ''Venerable'' came within range and a close action soon followed, Hood ordering Hollis to bring his ship close to Troude's stern and open up a raking fire. ''Formidable'' had the better of the action however and at 06:45, with casualties mounting, Hood's mainmast collapsed over the side.<ref name="WLC468">Clowes, p. 468</ref> 

[[File:Beau fait d'armes du capitaine Troude 3895.jpg|thumb|''Beau fait d'armes du capitaine Troude'', [[Alfred Morel-Fatio]]|alt=]]
Taking advantage of the disability to the British ship, Troude pulled ''Formidable'' ahead in light winds, slowly rejoining the main squadron under Moreno, which was holding station off Cadiz harbour.<ref name="WJ129">James, p. 129</ref> As ''Formidable'' moved away, the remaining masts on ''Venerable'' collapsed and the ship grounded off [[Islote de Sancti Petri|Sancti Petri]]. There was concern in the British squadron that Moreno might counter attack the disabled ship, but the arrival on the horizon of ''Audacious'' and ''Superb'' persuaded the Spanish admiral to withdraw into Cadiz.<ref name="RG93"/> Hood was able to refloat ''Venerable'' on 13 July and the ship was towed back to Gibraltar with the prize ''Saint Antoine''. Saumarez left three ships to maintain the blockade at Cadiz, returning the situation off the port to that before the battle.<ref name="WJ130">James, p. 130</ref>

==Aftermath==
In France the campaign was represented as a victory, as Linois genuine achievements at Algeciras were followed by exaggerated reports of Troude's defence in Conil Bay in which the second battle was represented as a significant success against a more numerous British force. Undoubtedly Troude had shown skill and bravery in the engagement, but his subsequent reputation was largely built on the strength of a report sent to [[Paris]] by Dumanoir le Pelley on the strength of a letter written by Captain Troude. In the letter, he claimed that he had fought not only ''Venerable'' and ''Thames'', but also ''Caesar'' and ''Spencer'' (misidentified in the report as ''Superb'').<ref name="WJ131">James, p. 131</ref> Stating that he had not only driven all of these ships off, but that he had also completely destroyed ''Venerable'' by driving the ship ashore. Troude was subsequently promoted and highly praised, holding a number of important active commands in the French Navy.<ref name="WLC469">Clowes, p. 469</ref> In Spain, the outcome of the campaign infuriated the Spanish government and contributed to the souring of the Franco-Spanish alliance. The Spanish demanded that the Spanish forces then stationed at [[Brest, France|Brest]] on the French Atlantic coast return to Spanish waters, and Spanish pressure on Portugal was relaxed. This weakening of the Franco-Spanish axis was a significant factor in the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in early 1802 that brought the French Revolutionary Wars to a close.<ref name="NR472">Rodger, p. 472</ref>

Saumarez was lauded in Britain, the success of the second action mitigating the initial defeat. He was awarded the thanks of both [[Houses of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Houses of Parliament]] and made a [[Knight of the Bath]] with a pension of <U+00A3>1,200 annually (the equivalent of <U+00A3>{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1200|1801|r=-3}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}.<ref name="WJ130"/> Nearly five decades later, the second battle (although not the first) was among the actions recognised by the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]], awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.<ref name="LG4">{{LondonGazette|issue=20939|startpage=236|endpage=245|date=26 January 1849|accessdate=6 April 2012}}</ref> The campaign later played a prominent part in the novels [[Master and Commander]] by [[Patrick O'Brian]] and ''Touch and Go'' by [[C. Northcote Parkinson]].<ref>[[O'Brian, Patrick]], ''[[Master and Commander]]'', 1969, Harper Collins, ISBN 0006499155</ref><ref>[[C. Northcote Parkinson|Parkinson, C. Northcote]], ''Touch and Go'', 1978, Littlehampton Books, ISBN 0417024606</ref> In British histories the campaign is usually considered as a single linked battle, with the overall outcome favourable to the British force despite the failure to prevent Linois linking with Cadiz and the loss of ''Hannibal''.<ref name="NM408">Mostert, p. 408</ref> The severe losses inflicted on the Spanish fleet at Cadiz and the reinstatement of the blockade meant that the French plan to reinforce the army trapped in Egypt was a total failure, the garrison there surrendering in September after a hard-fought campaign against British and Ottoman forces.<ref name="NM409">Mostert, p. 409</ref> It also emphasised British dominance at sea by this stage of the war, reiterating that no force could sail from a French or allied port without detection and interception by the Royal Navy.<ref name="WLC470">Clowes, p. 470</ref>
