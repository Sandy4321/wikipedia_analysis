:''This article is about '''Alan Kotok''' who was associate chair of [[W3C]]. '''Alan B. Kotok''' who is the managing editor of Science Careers is also called Alan Kotok.''

'''Alan Kotok''' (November 9, 1941 <U+2013> May 26, 2006) was an [[United States|American]] [[computer scientist]]. He and his classmates at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) are remembered as the first true [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]]s in the book ''[[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]]'' by Steven Levy. He was an only child who skipped two grades before college where he became a member of the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]]. He married Judith McCoy, a choir director and piano teacher.

While studying at MIT, he helped develop what is sometimes called the first [[video game]] (''[[Spacewar!]]''). With his teacher [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] and other classmates, Kotok constructed the program that played in the first chess match between computer programs ([[Kotok-McCarthy]]). As a member of MIT's first freshman programming class, he wrote some of the first [[software]].

He became important to [[computer engineering]] through [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (known as Digital or DEC) where he worked for over three decades and where he was the chief architect of the [[PDP-10]] family of computers. Later at Digital, he created the company's Internet Business Group which originated several forms of Web-based technology. Kotok is known for his contributions to the [[Internet]]  and [[World Wide Web]] through his work at the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), which he and Digital helped to found, and where he served as associate chairman.

Kotok, with classmates [[Elwyn Berlekamp]],  Michael Lieberman, Charles Niessen and Wagner, began to develop McCarthy's [[IBM 704]] chess-playing program in 1959. Kotok describes their work in MIT Artificial Intelligence Project Memo 41 and in his bachelor's thesis. By the time "the chess group" graduated in 1962, their program played chess "comparable to an amateur with about 100 games experience" on an [[IBM 7090]].<ref name="AIM41">{{cite web | last=Kotok | first=Alan | title=MIT Artificial Intelligence Memo 41 | date=undated, XHTML December 3, 2004 | url=http://www.kotok.org/AI_Memo_41.html | publisher=MIT CSAIL | accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref><ref name=thesis>{{cite paper | last=Kotok | first=Alan | title=A Chess Playing Program for the IBM 7090 Computer | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

===Spacewar!===
{{main|Spacewar!}}
[[Image:Spacewar and controller.png|right|thumb|A control box for ''Spacewar!'' and T-Square]]
Martin Graetz, [[Steve Russell|Stephen Russell]] and Wayne Wiitanen conceived the computer game ''[[Spacewar!]]'' while working at [[Harvard University]] in 1961. Inspired by [[Marvin Minsky]]'s ''Three Position Display'' (which they called the ''Minskytron''), they had the first version running, with help from their MIT classmates Dan Edwards, Kotok, Stephen D. Piner, Samson and Saunders, by early 1962. Coded by Russell, ''Spacewar!'' was one of the earliest [[Interactive#Computer science|interactive]] computer games<ref name="Graetz">{{cite web | last=Graetz | first=J.

Kotok did not write any of the ''Spacewar!'' code, but he did travel to Digital to obtain a sine-cosine routine that Russell needed.<ref name="DigitalLibrary">{{cite web | author=Digital Equipment Corporation | title=Sine-cosine Routine | date=31 December 1962 | publisher=Computer History Museum | url=http://www.computerhistory.org/pdp-1/index.php?f=showitem&id=22.11 | accessdate=2006-07-20}}</ref> Graetz credited Kotok and Saunders with building the [[game controllers]] that allowed two people to play side by side.<ref name="Graetz"/>

===Software===
[[Edward Fredkin]], at one time at [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman|BBN Technologies (BBN)]] (Digital's first customer for the PDP-1), McCarthy, Russell, Samson, Kotok and [[Harlan Anderson]] met in May 2006 for a panel to celebrate the Computer History Museum's restoration of a PDP-1 (with [[Gordon Bell]] on tape).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Computer History Museum|title=PDP-1 Restoration Project|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/pdp-1/|accessdate=2009-01-23}}</ref> Their presentations illustrated the contributions of TX-0 and PDP-1 users to early [[software]].
* Piner wrote [[Expensive Typewriter]] which enabled the group to operate the TX-0 and PDP-1 directly.
* Wagner wrote [[Expensive Desk Calculator]].
* On a second PDP-1 in the physics department, Daniel L. Murphy wrote the [[Text Editor and Corrector|Text Editor and Corrector (TECO)]] text editor, later used to implement [[Emacs]].
* Samson wrote the type-justifying program known as [[TJ-2]], an early page layout program, and implemented the [[War (card game)|War]] card game.
* Collaboration on computing waveforms with Dennis on the TX-0 led to Samson writing the [[Harmony Compiler]] with which PDP-1 users coded music.
* Kotok and Samson worked together on [[T-Square (software)|T-Square]], a drafting program that used a ''Spacewar!'' controller to move the cursor.<ref name=CHMMouse/>
* Gross and Kotok built the [[digital audio]] program [[Expensive Tape Recorder]].

Early PDP-1 users wrote [[Computer software#System.2C programming and application software|programming software]] including an [[Assembly language#Assembler|assembler]] translated from the TX-0 over one weekend in 1961.<ref name=CHMMouse/> Kotok later wrote an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] for the [[Lisp programming language]] in TECO macros.<ref name=CHMMouse/>

Kotok and his classmates are described as the first true hackers in the book ''[[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]]'' by [[Steven Levy]].<ref name=Levybook />

==Digital: 1962<U+2013>1996==
After graduating from MIT, Kotok started at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] as one of the company's first few dozen employees; in his 34-year career with the company, he held senior engineering positions in storage, telecommunications and software.<ref name=W3CAlumni /><ref name=Marquard />

He began in 1962 by writing a [[Fortran]] [[compiler]] for the [[PDP-4]], before contributing to the development of the [[PDP-5]] instruction set.<ref name=oralhistory/> Under Harlan Anderson (Vice President of Engineering), principal architect [[Gordon Bell]] led a team, including Kotok as an assistant logic designer,  which developed the first commercial [[time-sharing]] computer, the [[PDP-6]], designed and delivered in 1963<U+2013>1964.<ref name=Marquard /> Aiming at a scientific market, Digital machines had a 36-bit word length to accommodate [[artificial intelligence]] work in Lisp and to compete with [[IBM]] [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computers.<ref name=Twenty>{{cite web | title=Twenty Years of 36-bit Computing with Digital 1964-1984 | date=1984 | url=http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/20yrs/index.html | publisher=Digital Equipment Corporation

Kotok expanded his areas of expertise from engineering into teaching and business: following a suggestion of Berlekamp, he taught logic design at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] during the 1975<U+2013>1976 academic year; he also obtained a master's degree in business administration from [[Clark University]] in 1978,<ref name=CV>{{cite paper | last=Kotok | first=Alan | title=Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Summary Sheet | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology}}</ref> which prepared him for later work at Digital and W3C.
