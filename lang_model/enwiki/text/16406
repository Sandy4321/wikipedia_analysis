From its origin in southwestern [[Tibet]] as the [[Yarlung Zangbo River|Yarlung Tsangpo River]], it flows across southern Tibet to break through the [[Himalayas]] in great gorges and into [[Arunachal Pradesh]] ([[India]]) where it is known as [[Dihang]].<ref name="eosweb">{{cite web|url=http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/HPDOCS/misr/misr_html/yarlang_tsangpo.html|title=Yarlung Tsangpo River in China|publisher=Atmospheric Data Science Center|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref>  It flows southwest through the Assam Valley as Brahmaputra and south through [[Bangladesh]] as the [[Jamuna River|Jamuna]] (not to be mistaken with [[Yamuna River|Yamuna]] of [[India]]). There it merges with the [[Ganges River|Ganges]] to form a vast delta, the [[Sunderbans]]. About 1,800 miles (2,900&nbsp;km) long, the river is an important source for [[irrigation]] and transportation. Its upper course was long unknown, and its identity with the Yarlung Tsangpo was only established by exploration in 1884-86.  This river is often called Tsangpo-Brahmaputra river. The average depth of river is {{convert|124|ft|m}} and maximum depth is {{convert|380|ft|m}}.
In Bangladesh the river merges with the Ganges and splits into two: the Padma and Meghna River. While most rivers on the Indian subcontinent have female names, this river has a rare male name, as it means "son of [[Brahma]]" in [[Sanskrit]] (putra means "son").

The Brahmaputra is navigable for most of its length. The lower part reaches are sacred to [[Hinduism|Hindus]]. The river is prone to catastrophic flooding in spring when the Himalayan snows melt. It is also one of the few rivers in the [[world]] that exhibit a [[tidal bore]].

==River course==
===Tibet===

The [[Yarlung Tsangpo River (Tibet)|Yarlung Tsangpo]] originates in the ''Jima Yangzong'' glacier<ref>''[http://www.100gogo.com/canyon.htm The New Largest Canyon in the World]'' from [http://www.100gogo.com 100gogo.com]''</ref> near [[Mount Kailash]] in the northern Himalayas.  It then flows east for about {{convert|1700|km}}, at an average height of {{convert|4000|m|ft}}, and is thus the highest of the major rivers in the world.  At its easternmost point, it bends around [[Mt. Namcha Barwa]], and forms the [[Yarlung Tsangpo Canyon]] which is considered the deepest in the world.<ref>''[http://www.canyonsworldwide.com/tibet/mainframe2.html Canyonlands of Tibet and Central Asia]'', from [http://www.canyonsworldwide.com canyonsworldwide.com].</ref>

===Assam and adjoining region===
[[File:Brahmaputra system.png|thumb|right|400px|Map showing part of its course and tributaries in northeastern India and Bangladesh]]
As the river enters [[Arunachal Pradesh]], it is called ''Siang'' and makes a very rapid descent from its original height in Tibet, and finally appears in the plains, where it is called ''Dihang''.  It flows for about {{convert|35|km}} and is joined by two other major rivers: [[Dibang Valley district|Dibang]] and [[Lohit River|Lohit]].  From this point of confluence, the river becomes very wide and is called Brahmaputra. It is joined in [[Sonitpur|Sonitpur District]] by the Jia Bhoreli (named the [[Kameng River]] where it flows from [[Arunachal Pradesh]]) and flows through the entire state  of [[Assam]].  In Assam the river is sometimes as wide as {{convert|10|km}}.  Between [[Dibrugarh district|Dibrugarh]] and [[Lakhimpur district]]s the river divides into two channels---the northern ''Kherkutia'' channel and the southern Brahmaputra channel.  The two channels join again about {{convert|100|km}} downstream forming the [[Majuli]] island.  At [[Guwahati]] near the  ancient pilgrimage center of [[Hajo (India)|Hajo]], the Brahmaputra cuts through the rocks of the Shillong Plateau, and is at its narrowest at {{convert|1|km|yd}} bank-to-bank.  Because the Brahmaputra is the narrowest at this point the [[Battle of Saraighat]] was fought here. The first rail-cum-road bridge across the Brahmaputra was opened to traffic in April 1962 at Saraighat.  

The environment of the Brahmaputra floodplains in Assam have been described as the [[Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests]] [[ecoregion]]. When compared to the other major rivers in India, the Brahmaputra is less polluted but it has its own problems: petroleum refining units contribute most of the industrial pollution load into the basin along with other medium and small industries. The main problem facing the river basin is that of constant flooding. Floods have been occurring more often in recent years with deforestation, and other human activities being the major causes.

===Bangladesh===
[[Image:Bangladesh LOC 1996 map.jpg|right|240px|thumb|A Map showing major rivers in Bangladesh including both branches of Brahmaputra - [[Jamuna River|Jamuna]] and lower Brahmaputra.]]
[[Image:Brahmaputra River SPOT 1125.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Brahmaputra river seen from a [[Spot satellite]]]]
In [[Bangladesh]], the Brahmaputra splits into two branches: the much larger branch continues due south as the [[Jamuna River|Jamuna]] (''{{translit-Bengali2|Jomuna}}'') and flows into the Lower [[Ganges River|Ganges]], locally called [[Padma River|Padma]] (''{{translit-Bengali2|P<U+00F4>dda}}''), while the older branch curves southeast as the lower Brahmaputra (''{{translit-Bengali2|Bromhoputro}}'') and flows into the [[Meghna River|Meghna]]. Both paths eventually reconverge near [[Chandpur District|Chandpur]] in  Bangladesh and flow out into the Bay of Bengal. However, Before 250 years ago it was the actual [[Brahmaputra]] river in Bangladesh passes through the [[Jamalpur]] and [[Mymensingh]] district,a serious earthquake led its in present flow.  Fed by the waters of the [[Ganges River|Ganges]] and Brahmaputra, this river system forms the [[Ganges Delta]], the largest [[river delta]] in the [[world]] {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.

==Flooding==
During the monsoon season (June-October), floods are a common occurrence. Deforestation in the Brahmaputra watershed has resulted in increased siltation levels, flash floods, and soil erosion in critical downstream habitat, such as the [[Kaziranga National Park]] in middle Assam. Occasionally, massive flooding causes huge losses to crops, life and property. Periodic flooding is a natural phenomenon which is ecologically important because it helps maintain the lowland grasslands and associated wildlife. Periodic floods also deposit fresh alluvium replenishing the fertile soil of the Brahmaputra River Valley. Thus flooding, agriculture, and agricultural practices are closely connected.<ref>Das, D.C. 2000. Agricultural Landuse and Productivity Pattern in Lower Brahmaputra valley (1970-71 and 1994-95).

Migration and Home Gardens in the Brahmaputra Valley, Assam, India. Journal of Ecological Anthropology 9: 20-34.</ref>

==Transportation and navigation==
Until Indian independence in 1947, the Brahmaputra was used as a major waterway.  In the 1990s, the stretch between [[Sadiya]] and [[Dhubri]] in India was declared as National Waterway No.2., and it provides facilities for goods transportation.  Recent years have seen a modest spurt in the growth of river cruises with the introduction of the cruise ship, "Charaidew," by Assam Bengal Navigation.

==Cooperation on the Brahmaputra==
The waters of the River Brahmaputra are shared by [[China]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]]. In the 1990s and 2000s, there was repeated speculation about China building a [[dam]] at the Great Bend, with a view to divert the waters to the North of the country. This was denied by the Chinese government for many years<ref name="economictimes">[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/China-admits-to-Brahmaputra-project/articleshow/5842624.cms China admits to Brahmaputra project] - [[The Economic Times]], 22 Apr 2010</ref>. At the Kathmandu Workshop of [[Strategic Foresight Group]] in August 2009 on Water Security in the Himalayan Region, which on a rare occasion brought together leading hydrologists from the Basin countries, the Chinese scientists argued that it was not feasible for China to undertake such a diversion.<ref>[http://asiasecurity.macfound.org/images/uploads/news_attachments/Kathmandu_Workshop_Report.pdf  MacArthur Foundation, Asian Security Initiative]</ref> However on 22 April 2010, China confirmed that it was indeed building a [[hydroelectric dam]] on the Brahmaputra at [[Zhangmu]]<ref name="economictimes"/>, but assured India that the project would not have any significant effect on the downstream flow to India.<ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/chinese-dam-will-not-impact-flow-of-brahmaputra-krishna/609953/ Chinese dam will not impact flow of Brahmaputra: Krishna] - [[The Indian Express]], 22 Apr 2010</ref><ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Chinese-dam-will-not-impact-Brahmaputra-Krishna/articleshow/5843654.cms Chinese dam will not impact Brahmaputra: Krishna] - [[Times of India]], 22 Apr 2010</ref>

In a meeting of scientists at Dhaka at 2010, 25 leading experts from the Basin countries issued a Dhaka Declaration on Water Security <ref>[http://nation.ittefaq.com/issues/2010/01/17/news0350.htm  The New Nation, Bangladesh, 17th January 2010]</ref> calling for exchange of information in low flow period, and other means of collaboration. Even though the UN Convention on Trans-boundary Water of 1997 does not prevent any of the Basin countries from building a dam, Customary Law offers relief to the lower riparian countries. Also, there is potential for China, India and Bangladesh to develop hydroelectricity projects and transboundary water navigation.

==Mythology==

There are many mythological stories on Brahmaputra. But the most popular and sacred one is about the river's birth in 'K<U+0101>lik<U+0101> Pur<U+0101>na'. It describes how [[Parashurama]], one of the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu, got rid of his sin of murdering his own mother with an axe (or Parish) by taking bath in this sacred river. On strict order from his father Jamadagni (who had suspected his wife Renuka of adultery), Parashur<U+0101>m had to murder his own mother by severing her head with an axe. As a result of this nefarious act, the axe got stuck to his hand and he was unable to take it off his hand. On advice from sages, he started on a pilgrimage and ultimately reached the place, which is presently known as Parashur<U+0101>m Kunda (about 25&nbsp;km north of Tezu in [[Lomita district]] in Arun<U+0101>chal Pradesh). The story says that the mighty river was then confined to a Kind (or Kunda) or a small lake surrounded by hills. Parashur<U+0101>m cut down the hills on one side to release the sacred water for the benefit of the common people. By this act, Parashur<U+0101>m<U+2019>s axe came out of his hand to his great relief and he knew that he had been exonerated from his sin.

In another story, Sh<U+0101>ntanu, a famous ancient sage began a long meditation in an ashram in Kailash Manasaravor area along with his beautiful wife Amodha. Amodha was so beautiful that Lord Brahma himself became enchanted by the beauty of Amodha and requested her to make love with him. But Amodha did not accept Brahma<U+2019>s proposal. However, by that time Lord Brahma had become so excited that his semen discharged at that place. When Sh<U+0101>ntanu came to know about this, he inseminated Brahma<U+2019>s semen in the womb of Amodha. Subsequently, Amodha gave birth to a son and he was called Brahmaputra (literally "Brahma's son"). The tank near the ashram of sage Shantanu is known as the [[Brahmkund]]. Another speculation is that because Brahmaputra is the largest river in India, it carries a male name, which is odd, because the holiest river in India, the [[Ganga]], is named after a goddess.<ref>http://www.nih.ernet.in/nih_rbis/basin%20maps/brahmaputra_about.htm</ref>.

There is another story which speaks of the Brahmaputra being an instrument of the Trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, or the Divine Triad, in carrying the legacy of a mythical prophet named Pranadhesh. He had been influential in certain areas along the river's banks, and his teachings gave rise to some concepts that still persist to this day. Pranadhesh had a wife named Bamhuri, whose love for him was so strong that she conceived a child without physical consumation. The child, Pranashad, grew into a fine young boy, and legend has it that his father became jealous of Pranashad's love for his mother Bamhuri. Eventually, Pranadhesh's jealousy reached its peak when Bamhuri's love for him faded, such was her obsession with their only son. In a fit of rage, he confronted Pranashad alone on the banks of the Brahmaputra. A fight ensued, and Pranadhesh grabbed the boy and hurled him into the boiling river. Such was his shame, that the next day he leapt into the river in the same spot where his only son had disappeared from view. Some say his plaintive cries for Pranashad may be heard in the still of the late evening.
