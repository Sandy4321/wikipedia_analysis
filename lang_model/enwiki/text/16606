She replaced [[Mogens Lykketoft]] as party chair after the [[Danish parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary election]]. She led her party through the [[Danish parliamentary election, 2007|2007 parliamentary election]], which was won by the opposing centre-right alliance.  Following the [[Danish parliamentary election, 2011|September 2011 parliamentary election]], she was appointed Prime Minister by [[Queen Margrethe II]] after two weeks of negotiations about the platform of a new government with the other opposition parties.

==Early life, education and personal background==
Helle Thorning-Schmidt was born in [[R<U+00F8>dovre]] to Holger Thorning-Schmidt, a lecturer in mathematics and national economics at the [[University of Copenhagen]], and his wife Grete. Her parents were both [[political conservative|politically conservative]]<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10010163 |title=Profil: Helle Thorning-Schmidt <U+2013> VG Nett om Danmark |publisher=Vg.no |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> and she grew up in the Copenhagen suburb of [[Ish<U+00F8>j]]. She attended Ish<U+00F8>j Gymnasium, from which she graduated in 1985. Her parents divorced when she was 10 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vejleamtsfolkeblad.dk/artikel/196111:Navne--Helle-Thorning-har-mistet-sin-far |title=Vejle Amts Folkeblad <U+2013> Navne <U+2013> Helle Thorning har mistet sin far |publisher=Vejleamtsfolkeblad.dk |date=2010-01-25 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>

She also holds a master's degree in [[European studies]] specialising in policy and public administration from the [[College of Europe]], a university in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]], where she studied from 1992 to 1993 (she is an alumna of the [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] [[College of Europe#Promotions|promotion]]). At the time, Denmark had a quota of one student at this prestigious institution, administered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Thorning-Schmidt was selected.<ref>{{cite web|author=Olav Hergel |url=http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1394870/portraet-helle-thorning-schmidt-den-foerste-af-danmark/ |title=Portr<U+00E6>t: Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Den F<U+00F8>rste af Danmark |language={{da icon}} |publisher=Politiken.dk |date= |accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref> In addition to her native Danish, she speaks fluent English and French.

She married [[Stephen Kinnock]] in 1996, and is thus the daughter-in-law of [[Neil Kinnock, Baron Kinnock]], former leader of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and European Commissioner, and [[Glenys Kinnock, Baroness Kinnock of Holyhead]], former British Minister for Europe. She met her husband while they were both attending the [[College of Europe]] in Belgium. They have two daughters, Johanna and Camilla. Helle lives in Copenhagen with their children, while her husband currently resides in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]], where he works as a director for the [[World Economic Forum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14944749 |title=BBC News - Profile: Danish PM-elect Helle Thorning-Schmidt |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2010-08-03 |accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref>

She became a Social Democrat during her studies in Belgium and joined the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Danish Social Democrats]] in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.information.dk/277877 |title=Det bliver i hvert fald en moderne velf<U+00E6>rdsdansker |publisher=information.dk |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>

==Member of the European Parliament 1999<U+2013>2004==
In [[European Parliament election, 1999 (Denmark)|1999]], Thorning-Schmidt was elected to the [[European Parliament]] as a member of the [[Party of European Socialists]]. During the five-year term, she was a member of the Employment and Social Committee and the Constitutional Committee of the [[European Parliament]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} She co-founded the Campaign for Parliament Reform (CPR).{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Member of Folketing==
In the [[2005 Danish parliamentary election]] Thorning-Schmidt was elected to the [[Folketing]].<ref name="FT CV"/>

===Leader of the Social Democrats in opposition===
After the defeat in the [[2005 Danish parliamentary election|2005 election]], in which the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] lost five seats and failed to regain the majority it lost in the [[2001 Danish parliamentary election|2001 election]] former [[Finance Minister of Denmark|Minister of Finance]] and party leader [[Mogens Lykketoft]] resigned his post, taking responsibility for the poor election results. In his speech of resignation on election night, 8 February 2005, he called for a leadership election in order to determine who should lead the party into the next election.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Thorning-Schmidt campaigned for the party leadership as a moderate candidate and was elected by the party members on 12 April 2005, ahead of the other candidate, [[Frank Jensen]].

She led the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] in the 2007 election, in which her party suffered modest losses and was forced into a third term in opposition. The party was also unable to regain its position as the largest party in the [[Folketing]].

She was against holding a referendum on the [[Treaty of Lisbon|European Reform Treaty]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7060654.stm Denmark announces snap elections], [[BBC News]] 24 October 2007</ref> During her [[2007 Danish parliamentary election|2007 campaign]] she promised to relax restrictions on asylum seekers and immigrants.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7087474.stm Danes in poll tussle over migrants], BBC News 13 November 2007</ref> She also opposed tax cuts announced by [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]], instead she would like to see more money spent on welfare. The party also campaigned on a platform of combating increased inequalities in society, and fighting global warming by making 45% of Denmark's energy from renewable sources by 2025.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/nov/09/gwladysfouche1 Denmark: A political guide], [[The Guardian]] 9 November 2007</ref>

Although her party again lost two seats in the 2007 election (now 45 seats), her leadership wasn't questioned by her party.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

According to a June 2008 opinion poll carried out by [[Gallup poll|Gallup]], the opposition centre-left was on 49.8% compared to 49.6% to the centre-right. This would leave the centre-left on 88 seats, two short of a majority, discounting the [[Faroe Island]] and [[Greenland]] seats.<ref>[http://www.bt.dk/politik/oppositionen-gaar-paa-ferie-med-flertal Oppositionen g<U+00E5>r p<U+00E5> ferie med flertal <U+2013> Politik<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Since late 2009 the opposition has enjoyed large majorities in the polls, and according to polls carried out in January 2011 the opposition leads the governing coalition under [[Lars L<U+00F8>kke Rasmussen]] with 5<U+2013>7 points and the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] leading [[Liberal Party (Denmark)|Venstre]] with 7<U+2013>10 points which would make the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] the largest party by far in the [[Folketing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://borsen.dk/nyheder/politik/artikel/1/199773/vaelgerne_straffer_pia_kjaersgaard.html |title=V<U+00E6>lgerne straffer Pia Kj<U+00E6>rsgaard |publisher=Borsen.dk |date=2011-01-21 |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>

Both [[Margrethe Vestager]] ([[Danish Social Liberal Party|Social Liberal Party]]) and [[Villy S<U+00F8>vndal]] ([[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]]) have pledged their support to Thorning-Schmidt after a potential election victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://borsen.dk/nyheder/politik/artikel/1/143035/vestager_peger_paa_helle_thorning.html |title=Vestager peger p<U+00E5> Helle Thorning |publisher=Borsen.dk |date=2008-10-20 |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> Since the [[2007 Danish parliamentary election|last election]] Helle Thorning-Schmidt started working towards forming a [[centre-left]] government coalition consisting of the [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]] and the [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Social Liberal Party]] with parliamentary support from the small [[Red-Green Alliance (Denmark)|Red-Green Alliance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.dk/politik/roed-dominans |title=R<U+00F8>d dominans <U+2013> Politik |publisher=BT.dk |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik/2010/12/02/232622.htm |title=Greens: Markant r<U+00F8>dt flertal <U+2013> dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik |publisher=Dr.dk |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>

===Appointment as Prime Minister===
{{See also|Danish parliamentary election, 2011|Cabinet of Helle Thorning-Schmidt}}
In the [[Danish parliamentary election, 2011|2011 parliamentary election]], she was relected to parliament. Although the ruling [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal Party]] became the largest party and gained a seat and the Social Democrats lost a seat, the opposition parties combined obtained more seats than the government coalition. Prime Minister [[Lars L<U+00F8>kke Rasmussen]] formally tendered his resignation to Queen Margrethe on 16 September 2011. Rasmussen's cabinet remained in office as a [[caretaker government]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Marie Hjortdal |url=http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1394823/loekke-gaar-af---nu-begynder-spillet-om-magten/ |title=L<U+00F8>kke g<U+00E5>r af <U+2013> nu begynder spillet om magten |language={{da icon}} |publisher=Politiken.dk |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> until 3 October, when Helle Thorning-Schmidt was appointed Prime Minister by the Queen following negotiations with the other opposition parties.

==Prime Minister of Denmark==
Helle Thorning-Schmidt officially began her first term as Prime Minister on 3 October 2011, after having presented her cabinet to the Queen and having received her official appointment.{{cn|date=October 2011}} Thorning-Schmidt presided over the successful conclusion of [[NATO]]'s [[Operation Unified Protector|strike missions]] in [[Libya]], to which Denmark was a contributor, less than three weeks after taking office.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/nato-to-decide-friday-to-end-the-aerial-campaign-over-libya-diplomats-say/2011/10/20/gIQAlpk10L_story.html|agency=The Washington Post|title=NATO: to decide Friday to end the aerial campaign over Libya, diplomats say|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref>

==Controversy==

The [[SKAT (tax agency)|Danish tax authorities (SKAT)]] and the police have investigated reports that Thorning-Schmidt's husband, Stephen Kinnock, was guilty of [[tax evasion]]. Kinnock had declared that he was not a resident of Denmark and thus not subject to Danish taxes, while at the same time Thorning-Schmidt had declared, in an application for dispensation for Kinnock to own property in Denmark, that he resided in Denmark "every weekend of the year from Friday through Monday".<ref name=BBC>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-10856352 Danish politics rocked over Kinnock tax status], BBC News 3 August 2010</ref>  Thorning-Schmidt attributed the discrepancy to a "big and sloppy error".<ref name=BBC/> On 16 September 2010, Danish tax authorities acquitted the couple and the charges of tax evasion were dropped.<ref>[http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1061397/revisor-skat-frikender-thorning-i-skattesag/ Revisor: Skat frikender Thorning i skattesag], [[Politiken]] 16 September 2010</ref>

In September 2011 the 2010 decision from SKAT surfaced in the Danish newspaper ''[[B.T. (tabloid)|B.T.]]'' It turned out that Thorning-Schmidt from 2000 to 2008 had made use of tax deductions applicable to her husband, even though he was not subject to Danish taxes and had no income in Denmark. The mistake was corrected by SKAT for the three years from 2006 to 2008, and Thorning-Schmidt paid  the amount she had saved due to the error. She was however not required to pay the amounts saved for the six years from 2000 to 2005, because of the statutory time limit for liability in such cases.<ref>[http://www.bt.dk/politik/thorning-fik-uberettiget-fradrag-i-seks-aar/ Thorning fik uberettiget fradrag i seks <U+00E5>r], [[B.T. (tabloid)|B.T.]] 17 September 2011</ref>
