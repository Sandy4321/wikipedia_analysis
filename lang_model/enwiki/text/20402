'''Philip and Son''' (also '''Philip & Son''') was a [[Shipbuilding|shipbuilder]] in Sandquay, [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]], [[Devon]], England.  Operating from 1858 until the late 1990s, it was Dartmouth's last industrial [[shipyard]].<ref name="Walter2009">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2009/02/25/dartmouth_shipyard_feature.shtml|title=Town's historic shipyard memories recorded|last=Walter|first=Louise |date=March 3, 2009|publisher=''[[BBC]]''|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref>

==Early history==
William Kelly began modernizing Dartmouth's Sandquay yard in the 1800s. George Philip (d. November 1874, aged 61 years) left [[Aberdeen]] for Dartmouth in 1854, becoming Kelly's [[Construction foreman |foreman]] [[Shipbuilding|shipwright]], and managing three [[slipway]]s at Sandquay.<ref name="Shipbuilding1939">{{cite book|title=Shipbuilding and Shipping Record|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5rQ-AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=January 1939|page=205}}</ref> With Kelly's retirement in 1858, Philip took over the yard. Shortly afterwards, Philip's son Alexander (nickname, Alec; d. 1899) entered the business.<ref name="Blackhurst" /> In 1874, Alexander inherited the yard. In the 1880s and 1890s, Philip & Son collaborated with [[Simpson, Strickland and Company]] of [[Noss Shipyard]] on recreational craft production.<ref name="JamiesonStarkey1998">{{cite book|last1=Jamieson|first1=Alan G.|last2=Starkey|first2=David|title=Exploiting The Sea: Aspects of Britain's Maritime Economy since 1870|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IoGEWqjb9iUC&pg=PA30|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=1 January 1998|publisher=University of Exeter Press|isbn=978-0-85989-533-0|pages=30<U+2013>}}</ref> 

Alexander left the yard to his sons, George Nowell Philip and John Nowell Philip.<ref name="Blackhurst">{{cite journal|last=Blackhurst|first=Derek |title=George Philip and Son Ltd, Shipbuilders and the Commissioners of Irish Lights |journal=Beam Magazines|publisher=Commissioners of Irish Lights|volume=20}}</ref> G.N. Philip became managing director, and was assisted by his brother, J.N. Philip and his brother-in-law, John Jules Sautter (d. 1951). In 1905, the business became a [[limited liability company]]. Its 1908 advertisement in ''International Marine Engineering'' stated that the company produced steam and sailing yachts; passenger and cargo steamers; tugs, steam and motor launches; admiralty [[Launch (boat)|launches]] and [[Pinnace (ship's boat)|pinacces]]; as well as all classes of main and auxiliary machinery and boilers.<ref name="International1908">{{cite book|title=International Marine Engineering|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OG7mAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA561|accessdate=4 November 2012|edition=Public domain|year=1908|publisher=Simmons-Boardman Publishing Company|pages=561<U+2013>}}</ref>

Philip & Son took over Noss Works from Simpson, Strickland in 1918,<ref name="Smart2000">{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:0zwP5okTKMgJ:www.dartmouth-history.org.uk/content_images/upload/Noss_History.pdf+&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiVc_5eU85ykLeTzp419tDuBu0QtUARX7MPeVM1m3DQhI5vRs4s4pYL6MjPUq5TVFSkU0Gew2hBwhBMlLNVxOJQkMCsuEYI4K_Jbab6gf_tESrhwYr7ywrLMoQRFJOf2fm5N5V6&sig=AHIEtbQw606pJd000eyZkLpEtJmCBeLAnA|title=THE SHORT HISTORY OF THE NOSS SHIPYARD IN THE 19TH.CENTURY|last=Smart|first=Ivor H.|date=2000|work=Reproduced from <U+201C>Maritime Southwest 13<U+201D> - 2000 - THE DARTMOUTH HARBOUR PAPERS|publisher=Dartmouth History Research Group|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref> and within two years, they opened a machine shop at Noss. During these years, Philip & Son specialized in the construction of [[tugboat]]s, first in wood and later steel. By 1923, [[Swan Hunter|Swan, Hunter and Wigham Richardson, Ltd.]] had a controlling share in Philip and Son, Ltd.<ref name="TheShipbuilder1923">{{cite book|title=The Shipbuilder and Marine Engine-builder|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TNTNAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 November 2012|edition=Public domain|date=January 1923|publisher=Shipbuilder Press|page=204}}</ref> In the mid-1920s, the shipyard began construction of coastal tankers, ferries and excursion boats, while in the next decade, in addition to ships, boats, and barges, the company produced kits for overseas assembly of small crafts. In 1934, after the death of G. N. Philip, Sautter became the company's Managing Director.<ref name="International1958" /> It became a [[public limited company]] in 1937.<ref name="Blackhurst" /> During World War II, the yard mainly repaired existing crafts, but it did produce a number of small military crafts. During a bombing of Dartmouth, the yard was hit and several men were killed. The company managed to operate, however, even after the attack. Sautter retired in 1947 after working for Philip & son for almost half a century.<ref name="Shipbuilding1951">{{cite book|title=Shipbuilding and Shipping Record|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2bE-AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=January 1951|page=369}}</ref>

==Later years==
The building program prospered in the years after the war. In 1950, the directors were T. Wilton (Chairman), J. A. Philip (Managing), H. G. Philip, J. J. Sautter, and G. M. Turnbull.<ref name="Iron1950">{{cite book|title=Iron and steel directory|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2KwEAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 November 2012|year=1950|publisher=L. Cassier Co.|page=74}}</ref> In the 1950s, it built coasters, tankers, ferries, tugs, as well as cargo and passenger ships for foreign concerns. John Alexander Philip (b. 1896) (Shipyard Manager, 1923-42; Director, 1930; Assistant Managing Director, 1942-47; Managing Director, 1947) became Chairman in 1957.<ref name="International1958">{{cite book|title=International Shipping & Shipbuilding Directory|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H_oYAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=4 November 2012|year=1958|publisher=Shipping World & Shipbuilder|page=211}}</ref> The shipyard and subsidiary companies experienced a change in 1965 and in 1969.<ref name="Blackhurst" /> By 1981, the company's specializations had turned to repairing ships, steel fabriation, and marine engineering.<ref name="Hemery1982">{{cite book|last=Hemery|first=Eric|title=Historic Dart|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XfQgAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 November 2012|year=1982|publisher=David & Charles|isbn=978-0-7153-8142-7|page=231}}</ref> Ship and boat building were discontinued in October 1999.<ref name="Blackhurst" /> The shipyard site is currently owned by Noss Marina Limited, which operates a [[marina]].
