'''Whitton Bridge Pasture''' is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI) in the unitary authority of [[Stockton-on-Tees (borough)|Stockton-on-Tees]], [[England]]. At 3.18&nbsp;hectares (7.9&nbsp;acres) it lies to the south of [[Whitton, County Durham|Whitton]] village and north west of [[Stockton-on-Tees]]. SSSIs are chosen by [[Natural England]] with Whitton Bridge Pasture being designated in 2004 because of its biological interest. It is one of 18 SSSIs in the [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Cleveland|Cleveland area of search]].

The biological interest is focussed on the [[species diversity|species rich]] [[Mesotrophic grasslands in the British National Vegetation Classification system|mesotrophic grassland]], found across the site, which is actively maintained through [[grazing]]. The species present are predominantly [[grasses]], while [[herbs]] and [[Orchids]] are also found. The area has been classified as [[British NVC community MG5|MG5]] under the [[British National Vegetation Classification]] due to the species composition. The site is small and isolated and therefore requires careful management to avoid damage from potentially threatening activity on neighbouring land.

==Reason for notification==
SSSIs are designated by [[Natural England]], previously [[English Nature]], which uses the [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|1974-1996 county system]]. This means there is no grouping of SSSIs by [[Stockton-on-Tees (borough)|Stockton-on-Tees]] unitary authority, or [[County Durham]] which is the relevant [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]]. As such Whitton Bridge Pasture is one of 18 SSSIs in the [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Cleveland|Cleveland area of search]].<ref>{{cite web | title=SSSIs in Cleveland area of search | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/sssi/searchresults.cfm?sssi_name=&frmcounty=1007 | work=English Nature | accessdate=2007-01-31}}</ref>

Whitton Bridge Pasture is nationally important for its [[Species richness|species-rich]] [[grassland]] which is unimproved by fertilisers. This type of grassland<U+2014>once common in the [[Tees]] lowland<U+2014>is becoming increasingly rare with its associated species also becoming scarce. Whitton Bridge Pasture is one of only two remaining examples of this habitat in the Tees lowland area. The other example is [[Briarcroft Pasture]] an SSSI approximately 3&nbsp;km to the south, which was designated at the same time but is significantly smaller.<ref name="briarcroft">{{cite web | title=Briarcroft Pasture citation sheet| url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/2000475.pdf | work=English Nature | accessdate=2007-01-31}}</ref><ref name="2004 report"/>

Under the [[British National Vegetation Classification]] (NVC) Whitton Bridge Pasture is considered as [[Mesotrophic grasslands in the British National Vegetation Classification system|mesotrophic grassland]] because it represents well-drained and permanent pasture. In particular it is considered the [[British NVC community MG5|MG5 community]] due to the species present. MG5 is widespread in many lowland areas in England, Wales and Scotland, being particularly centred in the [[Midlands]].<ref name="book">{{cite book |editor=[[John S. Rodwell]] |title=British Plant Communities Volume 3: Grasslands and montane communities |pages=p. 63 |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn= 0-521-62719-2 }}</ref> Whitton Bridge Pasture is predominantly [[Terminology used in connection with the British National Vegetation Classification|subcommunity]] [[British NVC community MG5#Subcommunities|MG5c]] (''Danthonia decumbens''), however subcommunity [[British NVC community MG5#Subcommunities|MG5a]] (''Lathyrus pratensis'') is present with a substantially different species composition.<ref name="citation sheet"/>

Located north-west of the town [[Stockton-on-Tees]] and 500 meters south of the village of [[Whitton, County Durham|Whitton]], it is a small site of 3.18 hectares (7.9&nbsp;acres) lying between a sewage works and Whitton [[Stream|Beck]]. Topographically the site slopes north towards the stream from a height of 40&nbsp;m to under 30&nbsp;m.<ref>{{cite web | title=Site map| url=http://www.natureonthemap.org.uk/map.aspx?map=sssi&feature=2000474,sssi,HYPERLINK,LABEL | work=Nature on the Map | accessdate=2007-01-31}}</ref> The underlying [[geology]] of Whitton Bridge Pasture is responsible for shaping the species-rich community found on the surface. [[till|Glacial tills]] and [[sands]] are the prominent geological features resulting in a relatively base-poor soil, characteristic of glacial drift geology. The soils of MG5c (''Danthonia decumbens'') subcommunity are typically acidic.<ref name="briarcroft"/><ref name="citation sheet"/>

Because Whitton Bridge Pasture is located in [[North East England]] it experiences a climate that is different from the [[UK]] average.<ref>{{cite web | title=East and North East England average climate| url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/areal/england_e_&_ne.html | work=Met Office | accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref> The North East receives on average 370&nbsp;mm less [[rainfall]] than the UK over a year. Similarly the North East has roughly 129 days each year with more than 1&nbsp;mm of rainfall, this is over 25 days less than UK average. Despite these differences the temperature is similar for both the North East and the UK, although the North East does have fewer days with air frost and more hours of sunshine per year.<ref>{{cite web | title=UK average climate| url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/areal/uk.html | work=Met Office | accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Durham average climate| url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/sites/durham.html | work=Met Office | accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref>

===Biotic===
The majority of the site is made up of species-rich grassland (subcommunity MG5c), which comprises three dominant species of [[grass]] and several other grass species at lower abundances. The dominant species are [[Festuca|Red Fescue]] (''Festuca rubra''), [[Agrostis|Common Bent]] (''Agrostis capillaris'') and [[Yorkshire Fog]] (''Holcus lanatus''). The less abundant species of grass include, [[Crested Dog<U+2019>s-tail]] (''Cynosurus cristatus''), [[Danthonia|Heath-grass]] (''Danthonia decumbens'') and [[Cocksfoot]] (''Dactylis glomerata''). The subcommunity also has many broad-leaved herbs including [[Centaurea|Common Knapweed]] (''Centaurea nigra''), [[Tormentil]] (''Potentilla erecta''), [[Succisa|Devils-bit scabious]] (''Succisa pratensis'') and [[Betony]] (''Stachys officinalis'').<ref name="citation sheet"/>

A second subcommunity (MG5a) is present and is characterised by the [[legume]] [[Meadow vetchling]] (''Lathyrus pratensis''). Other species present in this subcommunity include [[Salad burnet]] (''Sanguisorba minor''), [[Quaking grass]] (''Briza media''), [[Conopodium majus|Pignut]] (''Conopodium majus'') and the [[Orchid]] species: [[Common Twayblade]] (''Listera ovata'') and [[Early Purple Orchid]] (''Orchis mascula''). The subcommunity also contains [[Hordeum|Meadow barley]] (''Hordeum secalinum''), a [[perennial plant|perennial]] grass, which is a characteristic species of the Tees Lowland.<ref name="citation sheet">{{cite web | title=Whitton Bridge Pasture citation sheet| url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/2000474.pdf | work=English Nature | accessdate=2006-02-02}}</ref>

The two subcommunities of MG5, characterised by species rich grassland form a belt across the site, however they do not cover the whole site. Towards the north there is a community dominated by [[False oat-grass]] (''Arrhenatherum elatius''). The False Oat-grass is a [[Terminology used in connection with the British National Vegetation Classification|constant species]] in the [[British NVC community MG1|MG1]] and [[British NVC community MG2|MG2]] communities of the British NVC and is therefore not typical of an MG5 community.<ref>{{cite book |editor=[[John S. Rodwell]] |title=British Plant Communities Volume 3: Grasslands and montane communities |pages=p. 514 |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn= 0-521-62719-2 }}</ref> At Whitton Bridge Pasture it is growing on [[alluvial]] soils located at the northern edge of the site which have most likely been formed by Whitton Beck just north of the site. A number of [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] at the site are associated with flushes of the [[Carex|Pale sedge]] (''Carex pallescens'') which form small populations.<ref name="citation sheet"/>

==Management==
[[Image:Meadow vetchling 800.jpg|thumb|right|[[Meadow vetchling]] is a characteristic species of subcommunity MG5c at Whitton Bridge Pasture.]]
Natural England's role is to advise and help the owners manage Whitton Bridge Pasture effectively. To achieve this Natural England provides guidelines for each SSSI. Species-rich grassland, such as that found at Whitton Bridge, requires careful management for it to retain its high [[species diversity]]. This means many activities are not allowed at the site including: [[ploughing]], [[drainage]] and the use of [[fertilisers]], [[pesticides]] or [[herbicides]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Prohibited actions | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/sssi/old/OLD2000474.pdf | work=English Nature | accessdate=2007-01-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Managing SSSIs | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/sssi/management.cfm | work=English Nature | accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref>

Management of the site does require moderate grazing during the summer and autumn to help maintain the species diversity. This is because grazing removes each year's new growth which helps stop the site becoming dominated by [[r/K selection theory|vigorously growing]] grasses. Such grasses would allow a build up of [[Plant litter|dead organic matter]], which together with the increased growth, would reduce the growth of less vigorous species. The overall effect of this would be a reduction in species diversity, which was one of the reasons for the SSSI designation. Trampling can be of benefit because it breaks up accumulated dead organic matter.<ref name="VAM">{{cite web | title=Views about management | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/sssi/sitedocuments.cfm?type=vam&sssi_id=2000474 | work=English Nature | format = Word document | accessdate=2007-01-31}}</ref>

The small and isolated nature of the site makes it susceptible to damage from the surrounding area. For example [[herbicides]], thought to be generally damaging for the species richness, could get onto the site from the drift of spray from surrounding fields. To help combat this the maintenance of mature [[hedge (barrier)|hedgerows]] around the perimeter is encouraged.<ref name="VAM"/> As of 2006 the condition of Whitton Bridge Pasture is described as favourable.<ref name="2006 report">{{cite web | title=Stockton-on-Tees Borough annual monitoring report 2005/2006 | url=http://www.egenda.stockton.gov.uk/aksstockton/images/att1131.doc | work=Stockton-on-Tees Borough council | format= Word document | accessdate=2007-02-03}}</ref> This description means that the land is being adequately conserved and any conservation objectives are being met, however that there is scope for enhancement of the site.<ref>{{cite web | title=SSSI glossary | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/sssi/glossary.cfm | work= English Nature | accessdate=2007-02-03}}</ref> The condition of the site was also described as favourable in 2004 and 2005 assessments.<ref name="2004 report">{{cite web | title=Stockton-on-Tees Borough annual monitoring report 2004/2005 | url=http://www.stockton.gov.uk/resources/environment/planning/newsystem/amr_0405.pdf | work=Stockton-on-Tees Borough council | accessdate=2007-02-03}}</ref> In the future it is hoped that the grazing regime will become more regularised and will be of high priority.<ref>{{cite web | title=Condition of SSSI units | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/sssi/reportAction.cfm?report=sdrt13&category=S&reference=2000474 | work=English Nature | accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref>
