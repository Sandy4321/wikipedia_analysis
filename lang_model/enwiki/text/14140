'''Robert Howe''' (1732 <U+2013> December 14, 1786) was a [[Continental Army]] general from [[North Carolina]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  Born the descendant of a prominent [[Moore family (Carolinas)|family]] in North Carolina,  Howe was one of only five generals from North Carolina to serve in the Continental Army and was the sole North Carolina general to be promoted to the rank of Major General.  Howe also played a role in the colonial and state governments of North Carolina, serving in the legislative bodies of both.

Howe served in the colonial militia during the [[French and Indian War]], and commanded [[Fort Johnston (North Carolina)|Fort Johnston]] at the mouth of the Cape Fear River.  Howe also served as a colonel of Royal Governor [[William Tryon]]'s artillery during the [[War of the Regulation]].  At the outset of the Revolutionary War, Howe was promoted to Brigadier General, and was heavily involved in actions in the [[Departments of the Continental Army#Southern Department|Southern Department]], commanding the Continental Army and [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] militia forces to defeat in the [[Capture of Savannah|First Battle of Savannah]].  

Howe's career as a military commander was contentious and highlighted primarily by conflict with political and military leaders in Georgia and South Carolina. These confrontations, combined with Howe's reputation as a womanizer among those who disfavored him, eventually led to Howe being stripped of his command of the Southern Department.  He was then sent to New York, where he served under General [[George Washington]] in the [[Hudson Highlands]], although Howe did not have a successful or significant career in that theater.  He sat as a senior officer on the court-martial board that sentenced British officer [[John Andr<U+00E9>]], a co-conspirator of [[Benedict Arnold]], to death. Howe also played a role in putting down several late-war mutinies by members of the [[Pennsylvania Line|Pennsylvania]] and [[New Jersey Line|New Jersey]] Lines in New Jersey and [[Philadelphia]], and returned home to North Carolina in 1783.  Howe again became active in the politics of North Carolina, but died in December 1786 en route to a session of the [[North Carolina House of Representatives|North Carolina House of Commons]].

==Early life and family==
[[File:Collet Map excerpt showing Wilmington and Brunswick.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A map of the Cape Fear River showing Wilmington and Brunswick Town in 1770|A portion of John Collet's 1770 map of North Carolina depicting the environs of the lower Cape Fear, including Howe's plantation at top right, located near Barren Inlet]]
Howe was born in 1732 to Job Howe (also spelled "Howes"), who was the grandson of [[List of colonial governors of South Carolina|colonial Governor]] [[James Moore (South Carolina politician)|James Moore]], who presided over the southern portion of the [[Province of Carolina]], as well as a descendant of Governor [[John Yeamans]].{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  Howe's mother may have been Job's first wife Martha, who was the daughter of colonial North Carolina jurist Frederick Jones.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=5|ps=, but see {{harvnb|Ashe|1892|p=496}}, where Jane, Job's third wife, is attributed as his mother, and {{harvnb|Rankin|1988|p=218}}, where Howe's mother is called Sarah}}  Job Howe's ancestors had been planters and political figures in South Carolina during the late 17th and early 18th centuries.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=2<U+2013>3}}  Prior to Howe's birth, his family left [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] to settle on the banks of the [[Cape Fear River]] in the [[Province of North Carolina]].{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  Howe's father was a member of the extended Moore family, formerly of South Carolina, who settled the lower Cape Fear River, and collectively owned more than {{convert|80,000|acre|ha sqmi|lk=on}} of farmland on it by the 1730s.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=4}} Job Howe died in 1748, leaving his estate (and the wealth of his parents) to Robert.{{sfn|Ashe|1892|p=496}}  Robert had two brothers and two sisters, all of whom were mentioned in Job's will.{{sfn|Bellamy|1903|p=3}}

As a young boy, Howe may have been sent to England to obtain an education,{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}} although several sources doubt that Howe actually traveled to England.<ref name="Marker" />{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=5}}  At some point between 1751{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=5}} and 1754, after completing his education, Howe married Sarah Grange,{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}} herself an heiress to a large fortune.{{sfn|Ashe|1892|p=496}}  Howe went on to father an unknown number of both legitimate and illegitimate children, including a son, Robert, two daughters, Mary and Ann, and up to four additional daughters of unknown parentage.  Howe was widely considered a womanizer by contemporaries, and he became estranged from Grange by 1772, at which point the two separated.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  In the year of their formal separation, Howe recorded a deed for the support of his wife.{{sfn|Bellamy|1903|p=4}}  

Howe inherited a large amount of assets from his grandmother, and, upon the death of his father, became the owner of "Howe's Point", a rice plantation near Barren Inlet, which is today located on the mainland directly across from [[Figure Eight Island]].  Howe also owned a plantation called "Mount Misery" in what was then [[Bladen County, North Carolina|Bladen County]].  His grandmother had provided Howe with slaves and money with which Howe was intended to build his fortune.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=5<U+2013>6}}  Loyalist sympathizer and diarist Janet Schaw would describe Howe prior to the revolution as:

{{bq|1=...&nbsp;very like a Gentleman, much more so indeed than any thing I have seen in the Country. He is deemed a horrid animal, a sort of a woman-eater that devours every thing that comes in his way, and that no woman can withstand him. But be not in pain for your friend, I do assure you they overrate his merits, and as I am certain it would be in the power of mortal women to withstand him, so am I convinced he is not so voracious as he is represented.{{sfn|Schaw|1921|p=167}}}}

==Colonial political and military service==
In about 1755, Howe captained a militia company in Bladen County, and was appointed a justice of the peace for that county in 1756.  Howe was elected to the [[North Carolina General Assembly#History|colonial Assembly]] from Bladen County in 1760 and served until 1762.  In 1764, the Assembly created [[Brunswick County, North Carolina|Brunswick County]], and Howe was both appointed its justice of the peace and re<U+2013>elected to the Assembly from the new county in the years of its creation.  Howe would go on to be re-elected six more times from Brunswick County.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  In 1765, Howe worked with other colonial leaders such as [[Hugh Waddell (general)|Hugh Waddell]], [[Abner Nash]], and [[Cornelius Harnett]] to found the Wilmington Sons of Liberty organization, which was active in protesting the [[Stamp Act 1765]], which taxed most printed materials.{{sfn|Lefler|Powell|1973|p=244}}  At the time, the members of the Sons of Liberty did not consider their resistance to be rebellion, as it was based on the idea that government officials who performed acts in opposition to the will of the people were not acting with full authority.{{sfn|Kars|2002|p=112}}  After the resolution of the Stamp Act Crisis, Howe was made an officer of the provincial exchequer.{{sfn|Ashe|1892|p=497}}  Despite the Cape Fear River area being the epicenter of Stamp Act protests in North Carolina, Howe took no substantial part in the active confrontations with [[List of colonial governors of North Carolina|Governor]] [[William Tryon]], due in large part to their personal friendship and the patronage provided by the Governor for Howe's political ambitions.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=13, 14}}

During the [[French and Indian War]], Howe served alongside provincial soldiers from [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]].  In 1766, he was commissioned as a [[captain (United States)|captain]] of militia, and was given command of [[Fort Johnston (North Carolina)|Fort Johnston]] (located at the entrance of the Cape Fear River in present<U+2013>day [[Southport, North Carolina]]).  Howe served in this capacity between 1766 and 1767, and again between 1769 and 1773.  In the 1768 session of the colonial assembly, Howe played a prominent role by introducing a bill to remedy a currency shortage in the colony which led to many colonists having difficulty in repaying private debts.  His bill would have led to the acceptance of commodities as legal tender in the province, but it was not passed.{{sfn|Kars|2002|p=165}}  The Regulator movement was in part based on the grievances farmers in the North Carolina backcountry had in repaying debts for taxes and to private creditors, which Howe's 1768 bill had attempted to address.{{sfn|Kars|2002|p=161}}  

Despite his efforts to reform the province's policies, Howe was made a colonel of artillery by Governor Tryon and served under the Governor against the armed [[Piedmont (United States)|piedmont]] protesters during the [[War of the Regulation]].{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  Howe was among the Governor's entourage when he confronted the Regulators in [[Hillsborough, North Carolina|Hillsborough]] in 1768, and in 1771, at the [[Battle of Alamance]], Howe served in a dual role as a commander of artillery and [[quartermaster general]].{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=15<U+2013>16}}  In early 1773, when [[Josiah Quincy II]] visited North Carolina to foster cooperation between Southern activists and those in Boston, he investigated the causes of the War of the Regulation (to which he had been sympathetic).  Howe served as Quincy's guide, and with the assistance of Cornelius Harnett and [[William Hooper]], convinced Quincy that the Regulator movement had been unjustified and wrong to take up arms against Tryon.{{sfn|Kars|2002|p=209}}  Quincy found Howe to be a "most happy compound of the man of sense, the sword, the Senate, and the buck&nbsp;... a favorite of the man of sense and the female world", continuing to say that "[Howe] has faults and vice <U+2014> but alas who is without them."{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=18}}  More importantly, however, Quincy's visit with Howe, Hooper, and Harnett engendered a desire among those present to open up inter-colonial lines of communication in order to coordinate responses to future impositions by the British government.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=7}}

Howe's private fortunes were never stable, and between 1766 and 1775, Howe was forced to mortgage land and sold slaves to generate funds.  In 1770, Howe was able to purchase Kendal Plantation on the Cape Fear River, a {{convert|400|acre|ha sqmi|lk=off}} rice plantation, but in 1775, Howe mortgaged it for around <U+20A4>214.  While the causes of Howe's financial misfortunes are unknown, several contemporary critics held that the cause was Howe's need to keep up appearances among the ruling elite, while [[Josiah Martin]], Tryon's successor as Royal Governor, believed Howe's misfortunes were evidence of his potential for malfeasance with the public money.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=6<U+2013>7}}  Howe, as a legislator and public official, had a poor working relationship with Martin, and Martin deprived him of his appointed offices <U+2014> the captaincy of Fort Johnston and his position with the provincial exchequer <U+2014> shortly after the new governor's arrival.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|p=16}}  A legislative confrontation in 1770 over the Provincial Assembly's attempts to pass a law authorizing [[Attachment (law)|attachment]] of real property in North Carolina owned by persons living in England placed Howe in direct confrontation with Martin, who preferred a requirement that colonial subjects seek relief from courts in England rather than in North Carolina.{{sfn|Bennett|Lennon|1991|pp=16<U+2013>17}}

==Revolutionary political and militia service==
In December 1773, the North Carolina colonial assembly created a [[Committee of correspondence]], to which Howe, as well as [[Richard Caswell]], [[John Harvey (North Carolina politician)|John Harvey]], [[John Ashe (general)|John Ashe]], [[Joseph Hewes]], and [[Samuel Johnston]] were appointed.  That committee was tasked with corresponding with other colonies to coordinate plans of resistance to British attempts to tax or otherwise burden the colonists.{{sfn|Lefler|Powell|1973|pp=257<U+2013>258}}  Beginning in 1774, Howe was a member of the [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] and Brunswick County [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committees of Safety]], and in August of that year, served as a member of a committee that organized the collection of corn, flour, and pork to be sent to Boston.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  At the time, the [[Port of Boston]] had been closed by one of the [[Intolerable Acts]], specifically the [[Boston Port Act]], which was in reaction to the [[Boston Tea Party]] and other protests against the [[Tea Act]].{{sfn|Lefler|Powell|1973|pp=258<U+2013>259}}  

Also in 1774, Howe penned several documents expressing what would become known as [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] or "whig" sympathies, including an address demanding reforms from Royal Governor Josiah Martin.{{sfn|Ashe|1892|p=497}}  On April 7, 1775, Howe delivered an address to the colonial assembly formally rebuffing Governor Martin's demands that the extra-legal [[North Carolina Provincial Congress#Second Provincial Congress|Second Provincial Congress]] be dissolved.  Howe's response as adopted by the assembly led to Martin proroguing the colonial assembly.{{sfn|Bellamy|1903|pp=6<U+2013>7}} When in 1775 Howe received news of the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], the first military engagements of the American Revolutionary War, he began to drill the local militia, using the unusual combination of drums and fiddles.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=11}}  On July 15, 1775, Howe led 500 militiamen from [[Brunswick Town, North Carolina|Brunswick Town]] on a raid on the governor's mansion with the intent of kidnapping Governor Martin.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  The plot failed when Governor Martin made an early-morning escape from Fort Johnston to flee to the HMS ''Cruizer''{{sfn|Lefler|Powell|1973|p=270}} on the morning of July 19.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  Howe ordered the militia to put the fort's structures to the torch, starting with the home of its commanding officer and Howe's successor, Captain John Collet, who had previously been accused of corruption by the Committee of Safety.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|pp=14<U+2013>15}}  After fleeing, Martin made a proclamation on August 8, 1775 that attributed the growing unrest in North Carolina to what he termed "'the basest and most scandalous Seditious and inflammatory falsehoods'" propagated by the Committee of Safety in Wilmington.{{sfn|Lefler|Powell|1973|p=271}}  

During the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress#Fourth Provincial Congress|Fourth North Carolina Provincial Congress]] in 1776, Howe was noted to have proclaimed that "'Independence seems to be the word.  I know not one of the dissenting voice.'"{{sfn|Lefler|Powell|1973|p=280}}

==Continental Army service==

===Burning of Norfolk===

On September 1, 1775, the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress#Third Provincial Congress|Third North Carolina Provincial Congress]] appointed Howe to lead the newly created [[Second North Carolina Regiment]] of the [[Continental Army]] as its colonel.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|pp=16<U+2013>17}}  Howe, of his own initiative, brought his North Carolina troops into Virginia, arriving shortly after the [[Battle of Great Bridge]].{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=24}}  The North Carolinian then occupied [[Norfolk, Virginia]], which had recently been abandoned by Loyalist forces, and assumed command of the various North Carolina and Virginia units there.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  The region around Norfolk was being occupied by British forces under the command of [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore]], the last [[List of colonial governors of Virginia|Royal Governor]] of the Colony of Virginia.{{sfn|Ashe|1892|p=497}}

Howe, as senior officer (chosen over the more junior [[William Woodford]] of Virginia),{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}} engaged in contentious negotiations over access to supplies with the captains of British ships, now overcrowded with Loyalist refugees, anchored in the Norfolk harbor.  The situation deteriorated, and [[Burning of Norfolk|Norfolk was burned]] on January 1, 1776, in an action started by British marines and a bombardment by Royal navy vessels, and completed by Patriot forces.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|pp=25<U+2013>26}}  The fire raged on for two more days, and Howe ordered most of the buildings that remained standing to be burnt before withdrawing to further render the location useless to the British.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=26}}  During Howe's time in command at Norfolk, Woodford described the North Carolinian as a "brave, prudent & spirited commander".{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  On December 22, 1775, Howe was formally thanked by the [[Virginia Conventions|Virginia Convention]], and on April 27, 1776, he received the same honor from the Fourth North Carolina Provincial Congress.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}

===Charleston, 1776<U+2013>1777===
In March 1776, Howe was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General by the [[Continental Congress#Second Continental Congress|Second Continental Congress]] along with fellow North Carolinian [[James Moore (Continental Army officer)|James Moore]].{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  Howe and Moore were two of five North Carolinians to be given a general's commission in the Continental Army.{{sfn|Clark|1906|p=196}}  Both new generals were ordered to South Carolina, although the presence of the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy]] under the command of General [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]] at the mouth of the Cape Fear River delayed Moore's descent.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  When Clinton arrived off the coast of North Carolina, he issued a proclamation offering a pardon to anyone who had taken up arms against the crown with the explicit exception of Howe and fellow revolutionary Cornelius Harnett,{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}} then serving as President of the North Carolina Provincial Council, the executive body in the revolutionary state.{{sfn|Whitaker|1908|pp=1<U+2013>2}}  Howe's plantation was destroyed by the British during their maneuvers around Wilmington.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}

Upon arriving in Charleston, Howe acted as an [[adjutant]] to Major General [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], who had been appointed Commander of the [[Departments of the Continental Army#Southern Department|Southern Department]] of the Continental Army.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=72}}  Howe directly commanded the [[South Carolina]] militia during the [[Battle of Sullivan's Island|First Siege of Charleston]] in June 1776,{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}} and was assigned command over the defenses of the city proper.{{sfn|O'Kelley|2004|p=124}}  Lee was recalled to the North to assist General [[George Washington]], and in his absence, James Moore was appointed Commander of the Southern Department.  With Moore's death on April 15, 1777, Howe assumed command of the Southern Department.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  Howe was left in command of Charleston and [[Savannah, Georgia]] in Lee's absence, and in September 1776, he became embroiled in a controversy involving the provincial assembly of South Carolina allowing its officers to recruit soldiers from North Carolina's continental line units.  Howe pleaded with the Provincial Congress of North Carolina to allow South Carolina to recruit within the former state's borders because of the greater number of white males in that state.  Eventually, North Carolina acceded to that request but only after ordering Howe to reclaim the North Carolinians who had been poached by the South Carolinians. The South Carolina Council took offense and demanded that Howe pay the recruitment bonuses for the men if he wished to have them back.  Howe attempted a short incursion into [[British West Florida]] under orders from Lee, but due to logistical problems and disease, he was forced to abandon those plans.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=80}}

===Florida, political conflict, and Gadsden duel, 1777<U+2013>1778===
[[File:Portrait of Christopher Gadsden.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A black and white portrait of Christopher Gadsden, standing in civilian dress with a cane|Christopher Gadsden, with whom Howe dueled in 1778, depicted in a prewar painting by [[Jeremiah Theus]]]]
Howe's style of command was quick to cause discontent, and on August 20, 1777, the South Carolina Assembly protested against Howe's right to command soldiers within the borders of South Carolina.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|pp=218<U+2013>219}}  He was nonetheless promoted to the rank of [[Major General]] on October 20, 1777,{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}} the only North Carolinian to reach that rank in the Continental Army.{{sfn|Clark|1906|p=196}}  In 1778, he was ordered to act on a plan developed by General Charles Lee to assault British West Florida <U+2013> a plan that Howe actually disfavored.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  On June 29, 1778, Howe captured [[Fort Tonyn]] on the [[St. Marys River (Florida<U+2013>Georgia)|St. Marys River]], which formed the border between Georgia and Florida.  Georgia Governor [[John Houstoun]], who refused to give up command of his militia to the Continental Army general, had several of his militia members arrested when they attempted to assist Howe.{{sfn|O'Kelley|2004|p=199}}  To make matters worse, when South Carolina militia units arrived in Georgia under the command of Colonel Andrew Williamson, their commander also refused to allow Howe to command that state's militia units.{{sfn|O'Kelley|2004|p=200}}  Shortly after this minor incursion, the British were reinforced and pressed toward Savannah.{{sfn|Ashe|1892|p=497}}  By July 14, 1778, Howe was forced to pull his units back north, and returned to Charleston.{{sfn|O'Kelley|2004|200}}  

Howe's squabbles with local political and militia leaders were not his sole difficulties.  On August 30, 1778, Howe engaged in a [[Duelling pistol|pistol]] [[duel]] with [[Christopher Gadsden]] of South Carolina over an offense Gadsden perceived stemming from his resignation in 1777 while under Howe's command.  This controversy, like many in which Howe was involved, centered on the conflict between the Continental Army and state governments' desires to retain local control over their officers and soldiers.{{sfn|Bellamy|1903|pp=9<U+2013>10}}  Gadsden responded to the perceived offense by drafting and circulating a letter attacking Howe's intelligence, ability as a commander, and questioning Howe's legal authority to issue orders to South Carolina Continentals.  Howe took offense, and demanded satisfaction from Gadsden on August 17, 1778.{{sfn|Godbold, Jr.|Woody|1982|pp=184<U+2013>185}}  On August 30, [[Colonel Charles Pinckney]], father of South Carolina Governor [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]], served as Howe's [[Duel#Offense and satisfaction|second]], while Colonel Barnard Elliot served as second to Gadsden.{{sfn|Godbold, Jr.|Woody|1982|p=186}}  Howe missed his shot at eight paces,{{sfn|Rankin|1988|pp=218<U+2013>219}} although the [[Musket ball#Ammunition|ball]] grazed Gadsden's ear.{{sfn|Ashe|1892|p=497}}  Gadsden shot second during the duel, and intentionally fired above his own left shoulder, and demanded Howe fire again, a demand Howe refused.{{sfn|Godbold, Jr.|Woody|1982|p=186}}  At the conclusion of the duel, the participants made amends, and parted ways.  This affair did not end privately, however, as the ''South Carolinian and American Gazette'' published a full story covering the duel on September 3, 1778, and in the same month, the ill-fated Major [[John Andr<U+00E9>]], a future co-conspirator to [[Benedict Arnold]], published an 18-stanza satirical poem set to the tune of [[Yankee Doodle]].{{sfn|Bellamy|1903|pp=10<U+2013>12}}

===Removal from command and Savannah, 1778===
[[File:SavannahCapture1778.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A map published in 1891 depicting the Battle of Savannah|An 1891 copy of a 1778 map depicting the First Battle of Savannah]]
In addition to Howe's political conflicts, rumors circulated in South Carolina concerning Howe's alleged dalliances with a female.  Due to this disruption and Howe's history of contentious relationships, the Continental Congress removed Howe from command of the Southern Department on September 25, 1778, replacing him with Major General [[Benjamin Lincoln]].{{sfn|Rankin|1988|pp=218<U+2013>219}}  Howe remained with the Southern army, and commanded it from Savannah.  While awaiting Lincoln's arrival in Savannah with reinforcements, Howe set up defenses around that city in order to defend against what was believed to be an imminent attack.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  Governor Houstoun sparred again with Howe, refusing to grant him more than meager militia support in anticipation of the British attack.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}   

During the [[Capture of Savannah|First Battle of Savannah]] on December 29, 1778, the British landed near the city, and under the command of [[Archibald Campbell (British Army officer)|Archibald Campbell]], managed to flank the army commanded by Howe, which was drawn up in the open for battle, by taking a path through a marshy area Howe believed was impassable.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=191}}  Howe had previously ordered a scout to look for any paths through the swamp, but Campbell's route, which was shown to the British commander by a slave, remained unknown to the Patriots.{{sfn|O'Kelley|2004|pp=220<U+2013>221}}  The militia under Howe's command fled instantly, and more than 500 Patriots and Continental Army soldiers were killed or captured.{{sfn|Rankin|1971|p=191}}  The ensuing defeat caused the loss of Savannah to the British, for which Howe received much blame.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=218}}  On January 3, 1779, Howe formally relinquished his command to Lincoln.{{sfn|O'Kelley|2004|p=222}}  At a later [[court-martial]] requested by Georgia's government, over which Baron [[Johann de Kalb]] presided, Howe was acquitted of wrongdoing with "the Highest Honor".{{sfn|Ashe|1892|p=498}}

===Hudson Valley and Pennsylvania, 1779<U+2013>1783===

After Lincoln's arrival, Howe was ordered to join the Continental Army in the North, which he rejoined on May 19, 1779.  Suffering from injuries caused by a fall, Howe was unable to undertake any duties for a month after his arrival.  On June 18, 1779, shortly after the [[Battle of Stony Point]], Howe was ordered to assist General [[Israel Putnam]] in assaulting a British fortification at Verplanck's Point, which sat across the [[Hudson River]] from Stony Point.  Howe was charged with commanding the artillery barrage of that position.  Howe was given very few field pieces with little entrenching tools, provisions, and ammunition, and as such, he advised Washington that an assault would be unfeasible.  Howe called off the siege of Verplanck's Point with Washington's consent,{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=219}} but later historians noted Howe's inability to take the British fortifications damaged his career and prevented him from holding any further major commands.{{sfn|Babits|Howard|2004|p=112}}

After Stony Point, Howe was assigned as commandant of the Continental Army [[Fort Clinton (West Point)|fortifications]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]], which he commanded immediately prior to Benedict Arnold's conspiracy to turn over control of that stronghold to the British.  Howe remained active in the [[Departments of the Continental Army#Highlands Department|upper Hudson River valley]] during the remainder of the war and served on the [[John Andr<U+00E9>#Trial and execution|court-martial board]] that convicted Arnold's co-conspirator, Major John Andr<U+00E9>, of espionage and sentenced him to death. In 1781, Howe assisted in putting down the remaining participants in the [[Pennsylvania Line Mutiny]].{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=219}}  Washington ordered Howe to surround the camp and arrange for the court-martial and execution of two of its ringleaders.  Again in 1783, Howe was called on to put down the [[Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783]], which had caused the Continental Congress to flee Philadelphia.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=219}}

==Post<U+2013>war career and death==
In 1783 after putting down the second Pennsylvania mutiny, Howe returned to his North Carolina plantation, Kendal, which was located upriver from [[Orton Plantation]].  Ostensibly a planter during this time, Howe returned frequently to Philadelphia between 1784 and 1785.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=219}}  In 1783, Howe became an original member of the North Carolina [[Society of the Cincinnati]] and was a signatory to its "Institution", or charter.{{sfn|Davis|Bellas|1896|p=81}} During 1785, Howe was appointed by the [[Congress of the Confederation]] to establish treaties with several western [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribes.{{sfn|Ashe|1892|p=498}}  In 1786, he was elected a member of the [[North Carolina House of Representatives|North Carolina House of Commons]].{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=219}}  On his way to a meeting of the legislative body, Howe fell ill, dying on December 14, 1786 in Bladen County.{{sfn|Rankin|1988|pp=218<U+2013>219}}<ref name="Marker" />{{sfn|Ashe|1892|pp=415<U+2013>416|ps=, citing an otherwise unsupported claim that he died in November 1785}}

==Legacy==
Howe has been remembered primarily in a negative light based on his lack of military successes and reputation, although North Carolina historian Hugh Rankin noted in a biographical sketch that "his opportunities came at times when he did not have proper field strength to gain favorable recognition."{{sfn|Rankin|1988|p=219}}  During the 1903 session of the [[United States House of Representatives]], Congressman [[John Dillard Bellamy]] introduced a bill to erect an equestrian statue of Howe in Wilmington in order to commemorate the General's service; this bill was not passed.<ref name="Star News">{{cite news|title=Revolutionary hero born in Brunswick County|author=|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&dat=19780702&id=NtROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KxMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7155,464678|newspaper=Wilmington Star<U+2013>News|date=July 2, 1978|accessdate=March 10, 2013}} Note that the article incorrectly cites the date as 1908.</ref>{{sfn|Bellamy|1903|pp=1<U+2013>2|ps=, note the correct date of 1903}}  In 1940 the State of North Carolina cast and erected a highway [[historical marker]] to commemorate Howe's service. The marker stands on North Carolina Highway 133 in [[Belville, North Carolina]].<ref name="Marker" />
