The '''2013 United States debt-ceiling debate''' is part of an ongoing political debate in the [[United States Congress]] about the [[National debt of the United States|national debt]] and [[United States debt ceiling|debt ceiling]].

==Background==
{{Main|United States debt ceiling}}
Following the passing in early January 2013 of the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]] to avert the projected [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]], political debate shifted to the debt ceiling.<ref name="hook1">{{cite news|last=Hook|first=Janet|title=Fiscal-Cliff Focus Moves to House|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323320404578215373352793876.html|accessdate=January 1, 2013|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 1, 2013|author2=Hughes, Siobhan}}</ref> The ceiling is a limit set by Congress on the amount that the government can borrow for public spending and was set at $16.4 trillion in 2011.<ref name=Kurtz>{{cite news |title=Bernanke: Get rid of the debt ceiling |author=Annalyn Kurtz |url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/01/14/news/economy/bernanke-debt-ceiling/ |work=CNN Money |date=January 15, 2013 |accessdate=January 16, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Felsenthal>{{cite news |title=Obama digs in heels, refuses to negotiate debt ceiling |author=Mark Felsenthal |coauthors=Matt Spetalnick |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/15/us-usa-obama-debt-idUSBRE90D0UK20130115 |work=Reuters |date=January 15, 2013 |accessdate=January 16, 2013}}</ref> The debt ceiling was technically reached on December 31, 2012, and extraordinary measures were taken by the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] to enable spending to continue.<ref name=Puzzanghera>{{cite news |title=Fitch warns that debt-limit delay could hurt U.S. credit rating |author=Jim Puzzanghera |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-fitch-ratings-debt-limit-credit-u.s.-20130115,0,4766520.story |work=LA Times |date=January 15, 2013 |accessdate=January 16, 2013}}</ref> If the United States does not raise its debt ceiling by 17 October, the government would have $30 billion to continue to spend its bills, plus incoming revenue. <ref name="bloomberg">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-10/republicans-enter-talks-with-obama-on-debt-limit-increase.html</ref> This is estimated to last from between 22 October and 31 October. <ref name="bloomberg" />

On January 15, 2013, [[Fitch Group|Fitch Ratings]] warned that delays in raising the debt ceiling could result in a formal review of the credit rating of the U.S., potentially leading to it being downgraded from AAA. Fitch cautioned that a downgrade could also result from the absence of a plan to bring down the deficit in the medium term.<ref name="Puzzanghera"/>

==Debate==
In a press conference held on January 14, 2013, President Obama stated that not raising the debt ceiling would cause delays in payments including benefits and government employees' salaries and lead to default on government debt.<ref name=Lee/> President Obama urged Congress to raise the debt ceiling without conditions to avoid a default by the United States on government debt. Raising the debt ceiling was also supported by [[Ben Bernanke]], chairman of the Federal Reserve.

Republican Speaker of the House, [[John Boehner]] and the Senate Republican minority leader, [[Mitch McConnell]] as well as other Republicans argued that the debt ceiling should not be raised unless spending is cut by an amount equal to or greater than the debt ceiling increase.<ref name=Calmes>{{cite news |title=Obama and G.O.P.

Several Democratic House members, including [[Peter Welch]], proposed removing the debt ceiling altogether. This proposal found support from some economists such as Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]]. A survey of 38 economists found that 84% agreed that a separate debt ceiling that is periodically increased could lead to uncertainty and poor fiscal outcomes.<ref name=PuzzangheraLee>{{cite news |title=Scrap the debt limit, some lawmakers and economists say |author=Jim Puzzanghera |coauthors=Don Lee |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-no-debt-limit-20130123,0,3187040.story |work=LA Times |date=January 22, 2013 |accessdate=January 23, 2013}}</ref>

==Debt ceiling suspension==
In mid-January, [[Paul Ryan]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on the Budget|House Budget Committee]], floated the idea of a short-term debt ceiling increase. He argued that giving Treasury enough borrowing power to postpone default until mid-March would allow Republicans to gain an advantage over Obama and Democrats in debt ceiling negotiations. This advantage would be due to the fact that postponing default until mid-March would allow for a triple deadline to be in March: the [[Budget sequestration of 2013|sequester]] on March 1, the default in the middle of the month, and the expiration of the current [[continuing resolution]] and the resulting federal government shutdown on March 27. This was supposed to provide extra pressure on the Senate and the President to work out a deal with the Republican-led House.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-34222_162-57564551-10391739/ryan-floats-short-term-debt-limit-increase-idea/ |title=Ryan floats short-term debt limit increase idea |deadurl=no |accessdate=July 9, 2013}}</ref>

Shortly after that, the House learned that the Senate had not passed an independent budget plan since April 2009. House Republicans quickly came up with an idea that would suspend the debt ceiling enough to allow time for both chambers of Congress to pass a budget.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

On February 4, 2013, President Obama signed into law the "[[No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013]]", which suspended the U.S. debt ceiling through May 18, 2013. The bill was passed in the Senate one week previously by a vote of 64-34, with all no votes from Republican senators,<ref>Business Insider: [http://www.businessinsider.com/senate-debt-ceiling-vote-2013-1 SENATE PASSES DEBT CEILING BILL]</ref> who were critical of the lack of spending cuts that accompanied an increase in the limit. In the House, the bill passed the week before by a vote of 285-144,<ref>Business Insider: [http://www.businessinsider.com/house-debt-ceiling-vote-no-budget-no-pay-2013-1 HOUSE PASSES DEBT CEILING BILL]</ref> with both parties voting in favor.<ref name=LoGiurato>{{cite news |title=Obama Signs The Debt Ceiling Bill, Ending The Debt-Limit Fight Until At Least August |author=Brett LoGiurato |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-signs-debt-ceiling-bill-spending-cuts-taxes-2013-2 |work=Business Insider |date=February 4, 2013 |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> In the House a provision was attached by Republican representatives that mandates the temporary withholding of pay to members of Congress if they do not produce a budget plan by April 15.

==Developments during suspension==
{{main|2014 United States federal budget|Budget sequestration in 2013}}
On March 1, the [[Budget sequestration in 2013|sequester]], cutting $1.2 trillion over the next decade, went into effect after the parties failed to reach a deal.

On March 21, the House passed a FY 2014 budget that would balance the United States budget in 2023. This compared to their 2013 budget, which balanced in 2035, and their 2012 budget, which balanced in 2063. It passed the House on a mostly party-line 221-207 vote. However, later that day, the Senate voted 59-40 to reject the House Republican budget.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/21/house-passes-gop-budget-bill/ |title=House passes GOP budget plan promising deep cuts, but Senate votes plan down |deadurl=no |accessdate=July 9, 2013}}</ref>

On March 23, the Senate passed its own 2014 budget on a 50-49 vote. The House refused to hold a vote on the Senate budget.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&session=1&vote=00092 |title=U.S. Senate: Legislation &amp; Records Home &gt; Votes &gt; Roll Call Vote |deadurl=no |accessdate=July 9, 2013}}</ref>

Throughout March and April, there were several developments that reduced the sequester's impact. The bill that extended the government's continuing resolution to September 30 lessened the sequester's effect on defense, and later bills removed furloughs for air traffic control and food service industries.

==Debt ceiling reached again==
On May 19, the debt ceiling was reinstated at just under $16.7 trillion to reflect borrowing during the suspension period. As there was no provision made for continuing commitments, Treasury began applying extraordinary measures once again. Despite earlier estimates of late July, Treasury announced that default would not happen "until sometime after [[Labor Day]]". Other organizations, including the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO), projected exhaustion of the extraordinary measures in October or possibly November.<ref name="Debt ceiling">{{cite web |last1=Sahad|first1=Jeanne |url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/16/news/economy/debt-ceiling/index.html |title=Debt ceiling: Treasury starts juggling act |deadurl=no |accessdate=July 9, 2013}}</ref> On August 26, 2013, Treasury informed Congress that if the debt ceiling was not raised in time, the United States would be forced to default on its debt sometime in mid-October. On September 25, Treasury announced that extraordinary measures would be exhausted no later than October 17, leaving Treasury with about $30 billion in cash, plus incoming revenue, but no ability to borrow money. The CBO has estimated that the exact date on which Treasury will have to begin prioritizing/delaying bills and/or actually defaulting on some obligations will fall between October 22 and November 1.

==October 2013 debt ceiling debate==
Obama and Republicans have disagreed on the terms of raising the nation's debt limit, and even as to whether the debt limit should even be a subject of negotiation.

House Republicans have described a number of policies they wanted to enact before they would agree to increasing the debt ceiling beyond October 2013:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/house-republicans-draft-their-debt-ceiling-playbook-20130707 |title=House Republicans Draft Their Debt-Ceiling Playbook |deadurl=no |accessdate=August 27, 2013}}</ref>

:* Long term debt ceiling increase (allowing Treasury to borrow for the rest of Obama's term): privatize [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and/or [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].
:* Medium term debt ceiling increase (allowing Treasury to borrow until sometime in 2015): cut food stamps, use the [[United States Chained Consumer Price Index|chained consumer price index]] (CPI), tax reform, agree to enact block-grant Medicaid or a large raise in the retirement age.
:* Short term debt ceiling increase (postponing default until sometime in the first half of 2014): means testing of Social Security, a small raise in the retirement age or ending agricultural subsidies.

Obama, in turn, has asserted that the [[Budget sequestration in 2013|sequestration cuts of 2013]] already represent a budget compromise, and that he does not intend to negotiate further on the issue of debt repayment. However, the president has said that he would be wiling to negotiate on almost any issue after a clean bill to reopen the government and increase the debt ceiling has been passed.<ref name="Reuters">[http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/16/us-usa-economy-obama-idUSBRE98F0OA20130916 Obama says he will not negotiate with Congress on debt ceiling], Steve Holland and Mark Felsenthal, [[Reuters]], 16 September 2013</ref>

In September 2013<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/29/us-usa-fiscal-idUSBRE98N11220130929|title=House Republicans defy Obama on funding bill; government shutdown nears|deadurl=no |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref> the House of Representatives drafted a bill that would postpone default for approximately twelve months from its passage. The bill also included a one-year delay in implementation of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], a requirement for both houses of congress to vote on tax reform plans by the end of 2013, and a fast-track process to begin construction of the [[Keystone XL Pipeline]]. However, the bill was not voted on by the House or Senate due to some members of the House Republican caucus believing that the bill did not make deep enough spending cuts to be worthy of Republican support.

The US Government went into a [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|partial shutdown on October 1, 2013]], with about 800,000 federal employees being put on temporary leave. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew reiterated that the debt ceiling would need to be raised by October 17th.<ref>News.com.au: [http://www.news.com.au/business/markets/what-happens-if-the-us-government-shuts-down/story-e6frfm30-1226730724779 What happens if the US government shuts down?]</ref>

In early October of 2013, the House drafted a bill that would raise the debt ceiling without conditions through November 22nd, but keep the partial government shutdown in place. If the bill passes both houses of Congress, the president is expected to sign it. Some Republicans and Democrats in the Senate are considering attaching a continuing resolution and a repeal of a medical device tax within the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] to the House bill.<ref name="PaulKane">[https://twitter.com/pkcapitol/status/388372594208305152 Cornyn and Collins say Senate Rs want to amend the House R debt limit hike, figure a way to attach CR component.
