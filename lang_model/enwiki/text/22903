'''No. 90 (Composite) Wing''' was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] that operated during the early years of the [[Malayan Emergency]]. Its purpose was to serve as an umbrella organisation for the RAAF units deployed in the conflict, [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 (Bomber) Squadron]], flying [[Avro Lincoln]]s, and [[No. 38 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;38 (Transport) Squadron]], flying [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakotas]].  The wing was established in July 1950 and headquartered at [[Changi Air Base|Changi]], on the east coast of Singapore.  No.&nbsp;1 Squadron operated from [[Tengah Air Base|Tengah]], in Singapore's west. No.&nbsp;38 Squadron was based at Changi and, from April 1951 to February 1952, at [[Kuala Lumpur]] in central Malaya.  Following No.&nbsp;38 Squadron's departure in November 1952, No.&nbsp;90 Wing was disbanded, leaving No.&nbsp;1 Squadron to carry on as the sole RAAF unit in the campaign until its withdrawal to Australia in July 1958.

==History==
===Origins and formation===
In response to the British Government's request for assistance in combating communist insurgents during the [[Malayan Emergency]], Australia determined in April 1950 that it could commit a [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] of eight [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakota]] transports and a [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] of four to six [[Avro Lincoln]] heavy bombers. Soon afterwards, the Federal Government formally announced its decision to send the Dakotas; on 27&nbsp;June, it confirmed the commitment of six Lincolns.<ref name="Solo246">Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 246<U+2013>247</ref> [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 (Bomber) Squadron]], operating the Lincolns, would be detached from the control of [[No. 82 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;82 Wing]] at [[RAAF Base Amberley|RAAF Station Amberley]], Queensland, and be based at [[Tengah Air Base|Tengah airfield]] in the west of Singapore. [[No. 38 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;38 (Transport) Squadron]], operating Dakotas, would be detached from [[No. 86 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;86 Wing]] at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales, and be based at [[Changi Air Base|Changi]], in Singapore's east.<ref name="Solo246"/><ref name="Examiner">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52812622 |title=RAAF wing takes over a new important job |newspaper=[[The Examiner (Tasmania)|''The Examiner'']] |location=Launceston, Tasmania |date=20 April 1951 |accessdate=on 15 April 2013 |page=2 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}</ref> The transport commitment was made possible by the recent return of ten Australian Dakota crews from service in the [[Berlin Airlift]].<ref name="Solo246"/><ref>Odgers, ''Diggers'', pp. 334<U+2013>335</ref>

Operationally, the RAAF squadrons were to be under the control of [[Far East Air Force (Royal Air Force)|RAF Air Headquarters Malaya]] (later No.&nbsp;224 Group RAF).<ref name="Solo246"/> However the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], was mindful of repeating the experience of World War&nbsp;II, when RAAF units and personnel based in Britain had been absorbed by the [[Royal Air Force]], rather than operating as a national force and being led by high-ranking Australian officers. He therefore decided that Nos.&nbsp;1 and 38 Squadrons should be formed into a "composite" organisation (i.e. one made up of disparate elements such as bomber, fighter, and [[reconnaissance]] units) and administered by an overarching RAAF headquarters.<ref>Helson, ''The Private Air Marshal'', pp. 224, 338</ref><ref name="APDC10Jul50">{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=196|title=No 90 Wing formed at Singapore| publisher =Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=on 15 April 2013}}</ref> No.&nbsp;90 (Composite) Wing was duly established at Richmond on 10&nbsp;July 1950, under the command of [[Group Captain]] Paddy Heffernan.<ref name="Solo246"/><ref name="APDC10Jul50"/>

===Operations and disbandment===

No.&nbsp;38 Squadron's Dakotas began arriving at Changi on 19&nbsp;June 1950, and No.&nbsp;1 Squadron's Lincolns at Tengah on 16&nbsp;July.<ref name="Examiner"/> No.&nbsp;90 Wing staff departed Richmond by air and established headquarters at Changi on 22&nbsp;July.<ref name="APDC10Jul50"/><ref name="Roylance">Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 122</ref> The Dakotas had flown their first mission the previous day; the Lincolns undertook their first operations on 26&nbsp;July.<ref name="Examiner"/> Nos.&nbsp;1 and 38 Squadrons performed their own routine maintenance, with aircraft rotating back to Australia for major work.<ref name="Examiner"/> The Lincolns generally conducted [[area bombing]] missions, as well as strikes against pinpoint targets. Not having to contend with [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]], the Lincolns operated mainly by day. After completing a bomb run, they would make another pass over the target to strafe with machine guns and 20&nbsp;mm cannon. The Lincolns were considered well suited to the campaign, owing to their range and ability to fly at low speeds to search for targets, as well as their fire power and heavy bomb load. Although the original purpose of the bombing campaign was to kill as many insurgents as possible, the impracticality of achieving this in operations over dense jungle resulted in a shift towards harassing and demoralising the communists, driving them out of their bases and into areas held by ground troops.<ref>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 247<U+2013>248</ref>

The Dakotas were tasked with airlifting cargo, [[Very Important Person|VIPs]], troops and casualties, as well as supply drops to friendly forces and aerial despatch of propaganda leaflets.<ref name="Solo246"/> On other missions they acted as [[Pathfinder (RAF)|pathfinders]] for No.&nbsp;1 Squadron, dropping smoke canisters on suspected communist hideouts that the Lincolns following above and behind would attempt to bomb.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50042500 |title=With the RAAF "Biscuit Bombers" in Malaya|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane|date=30 November 1950 |accessdate=on 15 April 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>  No.&nbsp;38 Squadron's operations ranged throughout Malaya and into Borneo, the Philippines, Japan and Korea; transport requirements in the latter areas led to a reduction in No.&nbsp;90 Wing's strength when four of the Dakotas were transferred to [[Iwakuni, Yamaguchi|Iwakuni]], Japan, in November 1950.<ref name="Solo246"/><ref name="Examiner"/> That month, Group Captain Frank Headlam was appointed to take over command of No.&nbsp;90 Wing from Heffernan.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2807473 |title=New RAAF CO in Malaya |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |location=Canberra |date=10 November 1950 |accessdate=on 15 April 2013 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> In April 1951, No.&nbsp;38 Squadron's four remaining Dakotas relocated to [[Kuala Lumpur]] in central Malaya, where they  undertook supply drops in concert with [[No. 41 Squadron RNZAF]].<ref name="Solo249">Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 249</ref>  [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] R.F.M.

The first aircraft he took off had to turn back owing to engine failure. The second completed the mission but had lost brake power when the time came to land; the crew was able to slow the aircraft on the runway by trailing a parachute from the rear turret as they touched down.<ref>Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', pp. 59<U+2013>60</ref>

No. 38 Squadron relocated to its former base at Changi in February 1952. Having airlifted more than 17,000 passengers and evacuated over 300 injured troops, the squadron departed for Australia on 1&nbsp;December and rejoined No.&nbsp;86 Wing at Richmond ten days later.<ref>Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', pp. 51<U+2013>52</ref> Following this withdrawal, No.&nbsp;90 Wing was disbanded at Changi, and No.&nbsp;1 Squadron became the only  Australian flying unit in Malaya.<ref>Dennis; Grey, ''Emergency and Confrontation'', p. 33</ref> It continued the bombing campaign against the communists until it was withdrawn to Australia in July 1958, having flown almost 4,000 sorties in its eight years of operation and dropped over 14,000 tonnes of bombs<U+2014>85 per cent of the total delivered by Commonwealth forces during the Emergency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=336|title=No 1 Squadron returned from Malaya| publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=on 15 April 2013}}</ref><ref>Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', p. 71</ref>
