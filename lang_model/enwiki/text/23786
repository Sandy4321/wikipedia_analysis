The '''Seuna''', '''Sevuna''' or '''Yadavas of Devagiri''' ({{lang-kn|<U+0CB8><U+0CC7><U+0CB5><U+0CC1><U+0CA3><U+0CB0><U+0CC1>}}, {{lang-mr|<U+0926><U+0947><U+0935><U+0917><U+093F><U+0930><U+0940><U+091A><U+0947> <U+092F><U+093E><U+0926><U+0935>}}) ([[850]]<U+2013>[[1334]]) was an [[India]]n dynasty, which at its peak ruled a kingdom stretching from the [[Tungabhadra]] to the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] rivers, including present-day [[Maharashtra]], [[north Karnataka]] and parts of [[Madhya Pradesh]], from its capital at Devagiri (present-day [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Daulatabad]] in Maharashtra). The Yadavas initially ruled as feudatories of the [[Western Chalukyas]]. Around the middle of the 12th century, they declared independence and established rule that reached its peak under Singhana II.

== Etymology ==

The Seuna dynasty claimed descent from the [[Yadu|Yadava]]s and therefore, its kings are often referred to as the "Yadavas of Devgiri". The correct name of the [[dynasty]], however, is Seuna or Sevuna.<ref name="ref_India_A_History_John_Keay">{{cite book

== Origin ==

Scholars are divided regarding the origin of the Suena dynasty.

=== Yaduvanshi origin ===

The Seuna dynasty claimed descent from the [[Chandravanshi]] [[Yadava]]s (Yaduvanshis) of north India.<ref>Chapter 8, "''Yadavas Through the Ages''" J.N.S.Yadav (1992)</ref><ref>Robin James Moore. ''Tradition and Politics in South Asia''. 1979. Vikas Publishing House.</ref> According to verse 21 of ''Vratakhand'' (a Sanskrit work by Hemadri), the Seunas were originally from [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] and later moved to [[Dv<U+0101>rak<U+0101>|Dwaraka]]. Hemdari calls them ''Krishnakulotpanna'' (i.e., descendants of Lord [[Krishna]]).<ref name="vaidya">Madhyayugin Bharat (Marathi translation of Medieval India) written and published by Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya, p.468.</ref> The Marathi saint [[Dnyaneshwar]] describes them as ''yadukulvansh tilak''. Some Seuna inscriptions call them ''Dvaravatipuravaradhishvaras'' ("masters of Dvaravati or Dwaraka"). Several modern researchers, such as Dr. Kolarkar, also believe that Yadavas came from North India.<ref name="kolarkar">Marathyancha Itihaas by Dr. S.G Kolarkar, p.4, Shri Mangesh Prakashan, Nagpur.</ref>

The remains of [[Khandesh]] (the historical stronghold of [[Yaduvanshi Ahirs]]) are popularly believed to be of [[Gawli]] Raj, which archaeologically belongs to the Yadavas of Devgiri. For this reason, the historian [[Reginald Edward Enthoven]] believed that the Yadavas of Devagiri could have been [[Abhira]]s.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=FoT6gPrbTp8C&pg=PA59&dq=The+tribes+and+castes+of+Bombay,+Volume+1&ei=wSxHS-_UDYiGlQSI8fz5DQ&cd=1#v=onepage&q=gauli&f=false The tribes and castes of Bombay, Volume 1 By Reginald Edward Enthoven], page 25.</ref>

There is a belief that Deoghur or Doulatabad was built in AD 1203 by a [[Dhangar]] or herdsman who, acquiring by some unusual good fortune vast wealth, was named by his brother shepherds Raja Ram and soon after assumed the rank of a Raja.<ref name="India p 355">The Asiatic journal and monthly register for British and foreign India, published in 1827, p 355.</ref>

=== Maratha origin ===

According to scholars such as Prof. George Moraes,<ref>{{cite web

A stone inscription found at Anjaneri, near [[Nashik]], suggests that a minor branch of the Yadava family ruled a small district, with Anjaneri as its chief city. The inscription indicates that a ruler called Seunadeva, belonging to the Yadava family, called himself ''Mahasamanta'' and made a grant to a [[Jain]] temple.<ref name="Nasik_district_Gazetteer">{{cite web

[[Jijabai]] (the mother of [[Shivaji]], who founded the [[Maratha Empire]]) belonged to the clan of ''jadhava''s of [[Sindkhed Raja]], who also claimed descent from the Yadavas.

Many Seuna rulers had Kannada names and titles such as "Dhadiyappa", "Bhillama", "Rajugi", "Vadugi" and "Vasugi", and "Kaliya Ballala". Some kings had names like "Singhana"  and "Mallugi", which were also used by the Southern [[Kalachuri]] dynasty. Records show that one of the early rulers, Seunachandra II, had a Kannada title, ''Sellavidega''. The Seunas had very close matrimonial relationships with royal Kannada families throughout their rule.<ref name="ref_Concise_History_Of_Karnataka"/> Bhillama II was married to Lachchiyavve, who was from a [[Rashtrakuta]] descendant family in Karnataka. Vaddiga was married to Vaddiyavve, daughter of Rashtrakuta chieftain Dhorappa. Wives of Vesugi and Bhillama III were [[Chalukya]] princesess.

However, there are opinions that these are only Kannada sounding names given by the people from that area. Their original Sanskrit names were different. 

Over five hundred inscriptions belonging to the Seuna dynasty have been found in Karnataka, the oldest being of the rule of Bhillama II. Most of these are in [[Kannada language]] and script. Others are in the Kannada language but use [[Devanagari]] script.<ref name="ref_Concise_History_Of_Karnataka"/> The Seuna coins from the early part of their rule have Kannada legends. Scholars such as Dr. O. P. Varma believe that Kannada was a court language, used along with Marathi and Sanskrit.<ref>Onkar Prasad Verma. ''Yadavas and their Times''. Vidarbha Samshodhana Mandal, Nagpur. 1938</ref>

During the rule of the Seunas, ruling chieftains who were related to the Seuna kings were from Kannada-speaking families, like the Seunas of Masavadi in present day [[Dharwad]]. Dr. A. V. Narasimha Murthy opined that during the later part of the [[Rashtrakuta]] rule from [[Manyakheta]], Seuna chieftains were despatched from the Karnataka region to rule near Nasik.<ref name="ref_The_Sevunas_of_Devagiri"/>
However, no such traces could be found in current Kshatriya clan near this area.

== History ==
=== Feudatory ===

[[File:Devagirifort.jpg|thumb|250px|Devagiri fort-The capital of Yadavas]]

Seunas were once the [[vassal|feudatories]] of the [[Rashtrakuta]]s and then of the [[Western Chalukya]]s.<ref name="ref_India_A_History_John_Keay"/> The founder of the Suena dynasty was Dridhaprahara, the son of Subahu. According to Vratakhanda, his capital was Shrinagara. However, an early inscription suggests that Chandradityapura (modern [[Chandor]] in the [[Nasik]] district) was the capital.<ref name="Nasik_district_Gazetteer">{{cite web

The name Seuna comes from Dridhaprahara's son, Seunachandra, who originally ruled a region called ''Seunadesha'' (present-day [[Khandesh]]). Bhillama II, a later ruler in the dynasty, assisted [[Tailapa III]] in his war with the [[Paramara]] king Munja. Seunachandra II helped [[Vikramaditya VI]] in gaining his throne.

=== Bhillama V ===

Bhillama V ([[1173]]<U+2013>[[1192]]), son of Mallugi, established the sovereign Seuna kingdom. He took over the Chalukya capital of [[Basavakalyan|Kalyani]] in 1190 and founded Devagiri (now [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Daulatabad]]) as the capital of the Yadava dynasty.

The Seunas were bordered by aggressive neighbours on all sides: [[Paramara]] [[Rajput]]s of [[Malwa]] in the north, [[Kakatiya dynasty]] in the east, [[Hoysala]]s in the south and [[Solanki]] [[Rajput]]s of [[Gujarat]] in the west. As a precaution, they built their citadel at Devagiri. The citadel was situated on a hill rising 183 meters<ref name="ref_Mathew_Bannet_Dictionary">{{cite book

}}. ''The quoted pages can be read at [http://books.google.com/ Google Book Search].''</ref> (300 meters according to John Keay<ref name="ref_India_A_History_John_Keay"/>). The hill was enclosed by three lines of walls, each of which was defended by [[moat]]s and [[turret]]s. The outermost wall had a circumference of 4.4&nbsp;km.

=== Singhana II ===

Singhana II [[1200]]<U+2013>[[1247]] C.E. is considered the greatest ruler of the Yadava dynasty. During his rule the kingdom expanded from [[Narmada River|Narmada]] to [[Tungabhadra]], reaching its zenith at the expense of [[Hoysalas]] in the south, [[Kakatiya dynasty]] in the east, [[Paramara]]s and [[Chalukya]]s in the north.<ref name="brit">"Y<U+0101>dava Dynasty" Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica.

He founded the town Shinghanapur (or Singhanapur). He was a great patron of learning and literature. He established the college of astronomy to study the work of celebrated astronomer [[Bhaskaracharya]].

The [[Sangita Ratnakara]], an authoritative [[Sanskrit]] work on [[Music of India|Indian music]] was written by [[Sharngadeva]] (or Shrangadeva) during Singhana II's reign.<ref name="ref_Gurinder_Singh_Mann_Sikh">{{cite book

=== Ramachandra ===

There is a belief that Devgiri or Doulatabad was built in 1203 AD by a [[Dhangar]] or herdsman who acquiring by some unusual good fortune vast wealth was named by his brother shepherds Raja Ram and soon after assumed the rank of a Raja.<ref name="India pg 355">The Asiatic journal and monthly register for British and foreign India, pg 355. Published in 1827.</ref>

Ramachandra (or Ramadevarava or Raja Ram), the grandson of Singhana II, ruled from 1271 to 1309 CE.

[[Hemadri]] (or [[Hemadpant]]) was Ramachandra's ''Shrikaranadhipa'' (Chief Minister). He compiled the encyclopedic Sanskrit work ''Chaturvarga Chintamani''. He is said to have built many temples in a style known after him <U+2013> ''Hemadapanti''.<ref name="palkhi">{{cite book

In 1294, [[Ala-ud-din Khalji]] captured Devagiri. Khalji restored it to Ramachandra in return for his promise of payment of a high [[ransom]] and an annual tribute.<ref name="ref_Mathew_Bannet_Dictionary"/> However, this was not paid and the Seuna kingdom's arrears to the [[Khalji dynasty]] kept mounting. In 1307, Khalji sent an army commanded by [[Malik Kafur]] to Devagiri. Ramachandra was taken to Delhi. Khalji reinstated Ramachandra in return for a promise to help Khalji subdue the Hindu kingdoms in [[South India]]. In 1309, Malik Kafur mounted an assault on the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] from Devagiri.<ref name="ref_India_A_History_John_Keay"/>

Alauddin Khilji invaded Devagiri once when he was the crown prince. Alauddin Khilji once again invaded Devagiri in 1306. The invincible Malik Kafur was on the spearhead of the army. He was accompanied with Khwaja Haji. The governors of Malwa and Gujarat were ordered to help Malik Kafur. The huge army conquered Devagiri almost without a battle. Alauddin Khilji appointed Raja Ramchandra the governor of Devagiri. He was given the title "Rai Rayan" (king of kings).

=== Fall of the kingdom ===

Ramachandra's successor Singhana III challenged the supremacy of Khalji, who sent Malik Kafur to recapture Devagiri in 1310. Singhana III was killed in the ensuing battle<ref>{{cite book

Bhillama V's son, Jaitrapal (or Jaitugi) had Mukundaraja, the author of ''Paramamrita'' and ''Vivekasindhu'' as his spiritual teacher.<ref name="ref_Gurinder_Singh_Mann_Sikh"/> ''Paramamrita'' is considered the first systematic attempt to explain the [[Vedanta|Vendantic]] principles in Marathi. ''Vivekasindhu'' is another exposition of Vedantic principles.  Mukundaraja's earliest works were completed in 1190 C.E. and Mahimabhatta wrote ''Lilacharita'' in [[1238]].

The famous Marathi saint-poet [[Dnyaneshwar]] wrote ''[[Dnyaneshwari]]'', a commentary on the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' in [[1290]], during Ramachandra's rule.

=== Kannada ===

Many scholars believe Kannada was one of the court languages during early Seuna times,{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} as is evident from a number of Kannada-language inscriptions (see, [[#Origin|Origin]] section). Kamalabhava, patronised by Bhillama V wrote ''Santhishwarapurana''. Achanna composed ''Varadhamanapurana'' in [[1198]]. Amugideva, patronised by Singhana II, composed many ''[[Vachanas]]'' or devotional songs. Chaundarasa of [[Pandharapur]] wrote ''Dashakumara Charite''.

=== Sanskrit ===

The Sanskrit literary works created during the Seuna period include:

* ''Chaturvarga Chintamani'' by Hemadri
* ''Suktimuthavali'' by Jalhana
* ''Hammiramadhana'' by Jayasimha Suri
* ''Karnakutuhala'' and ''Siddhanta Shiromani'' by [[Bhaskaracharya]]
* Anantadeva's commentaries on [[Varahamihira]]'s ''Brijajjataka'' and [[Brahmagupta]]'s ''Brihatsputa siddhanta''
* Haripaladeva's ''Sangeetasudhakara'', a treatise on [[Indian Classical Music]], which bifurcates Indian classical music as [[Hindustani Music]] and [[Carnatic Music]] for the first time, acknowledging the [[Muslim]] influence on Indian music.<ref>{{cite web
