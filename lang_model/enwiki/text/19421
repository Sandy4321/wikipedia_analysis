==Life==
Banks was originally apprenticed to his uncle William Hutoft. Banks seems to have occupied Hutoft's premises on Catherine Street in  [[Salisbury]] upon Hutoft's demise in 1747 until Banks' own in 1795.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skinnerinc.com/news/blog/english-violins-benjamin-banks/|title=English Violins of the Eighteenth Century: Benjamin Banks of Salisbury|accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref>  From 1757 until the late 1760s Banks was primarily interested in the [[keyboard instrument]] construction. He had a close association with Longman and Broderip in London who seemed to have been an outlet for his violins (these examples are stamped with the Longman name). The instruments were based on the Amati and Stainer form, the [[cello]]s being particularly sought after. Such instruments were often branded 'Banks' - externally and on the inner linings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dilworth|first=John|title=The Brompton's Book of Violin and Bow Makers|year=2012|publisher=Usk Publishing|isbn=9780957349902|url=http://www.amati.com}}</ref>

Banks's business was carried on after his death by his two sons, James and Henry, who subsequently moved to Liverpool.
