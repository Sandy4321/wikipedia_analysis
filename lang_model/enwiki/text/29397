'''''Dalton Transactions''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] publishing [[original research|original (primary) research]] and [[literature review|review articles]] on all aspects of the chemistry of [[Inorganic chemistry|inorganic]], [[bioinorganic]], and [[organometallic]] compounds. ''Dalton Transactions'' is published weekly by the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]].  The journal takes its name from the [[English people|English]] chemist, [[John Dalton]], best known for his work in the development of modern [[atomic theory]].

The [[editor-in-chief]] of ''Dalton Transactions'' is Jamie Humphrey. According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has a 2009 [[impact factor]] of 4.081. This ranks ''Dalton Transactions'' 7<sup>th</sup> out of 44 listed journals in the Chemistry, Inorganic & Nuclear category. <ref>[[Journal_Citation_Reports|Journal Citation Reports, 2010]]</ref>

== History ==
The journal began publication under the name [[Journal of the Chemical Society|''Journal of the Chemical Society A: Inorganic, Physical, Theoretical'']] in 1966.  In 1972, this journal was divided into three separate journals: ''Journal of the Chemical Society, Dalton Transactions'' (covering inorganic and organometallic chemistry)''[[Faraday Transactions|; Journal of the Chemical Society, Faraday Transactions 1: Physical Chemistry in Condensed Phases]]''; and ''[[Faraday Transactions|Journal of the Chemical Society, Faraday Transactions 2: Molecular and Chemical Physics]]''. ''Journal of the Chemical Society, Dalton Transactions'' was then renamed in 2003 to ''Dalton Transactions''. In January 2000, ''Dalton Transactions'' incorporated ''Acta Chemica Scandinavica''.

== Subject coverage ==
''Dalton Transactions'' publishes articles on all aspects of the chemistry of [[Inorganic_chemistry|inorganic]] and [[organometallic]] compounds, including [[bioinorganic]], biological inorganic,  and [[Solid state chemistry|solid-state]] inorganic chemistry; the application of physicochemical techniques to the study of their structures, properties, and reactions, including [[chemical_ kinetics|kinetics]] and mechanisms; [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] and characterisation of new inorganic [[Materials science|materials]]; [[Homogeneous catalysis|homogeneous]] and [[heterogeneous catalysis]]; new or improved experimental techniques and syntheses.

== Article types ==
''Dalton Transactions'' publishes the following types of articles: Research Papers (original scientific work); Communications (preliminary accounts that merit urgent publication); Perspectives (invited personal accounts or critical analyses of specialist areas); and Frontiers (intended to highlight emerging topics, particularly at the interface of inorganic chemistry with other disciplines, and are <U+2018>forward-looking<U+2019> in nature).

== Dalton Discussions ==
Dalton Discussions are scientific meetings that provide a forum for the exchange of views and newly acquired results in focused areas of inorganic chemistry. The papers, which are associated with the oral presentations at the meeting, are published in a special issue of ''Dalton Transactions'', which constitutes a permanent record of the meeting. The meetings are usually held annually.
