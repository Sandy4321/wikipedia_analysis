'''Kenneth R. Shadrick''' (August 4, 1931<U+2014>July 5, 1950) was a [[soldier]] in the [[United States Army]] at the onset of the [[Korean War]]. Shadrick was widely reported as the first American soldier [[killed in action]] in the war, dying at the [[Battle of Osan]]. Shadrick received national attention after his death, but subsequent reports indicate he may not have actually been the first casualty of the war.<ref name="WVA">{{citation|url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/wvmemory/vets/shadrickkenneth/shadrickkenneth.html |title=Kenneth Shadrick Biography |publisher=West Virginia Division of Culture and History |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-08-05 |last=Baston |first=Constance}}</ref>

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Kenneth Shadrick was born on August 4, 1919 in [[Harlan County, Kentucky]]. He was the third of 10 children born to Theodore Shadrick, who was a [[coal miner]], and Lucille Shadrick. Growing up during the [[Great Depression]], Kenneth Shadrick moved with his family to [[Wyoming, West Virginia]], then to an outlying county called Skin Fork, {{convert|20|mi}} away, looking for coal mining jobs. Throughout his childhood, Shadrick was described by his family as an avid reader who enjoyed, among a variety of things, [[westerns]] and [[magazines]].<ref name="WVA"/> He also enjoyed riding his bike and, occasionally, hunting.<ref name="Time"/>

Shadrick enrolled in [[Pineville High School (West Virginia)|Pineville High School]] in 1947 and was an "A" student. During his [[sophomore]] year in 1948, Shadrick developed an interest in [[American Football]]. Though he was small for his age, Shadrick managed to land a spot on the school's football team. His father donated {{currency|5|USD}} so Shadrick could buy a [[Jersey (clothing)|team uniform]], but it was subsequently stolen from his locker in October of 1948.<ref name="WVA"/> The incident upset Shadrick so much he reportedly dropped out of school that day, refusing to return.<ref name="Time"/> One month later, Shadrick and a friend decided to enlist in the [[United States Army]].<ref name="WVA"/>

On November 10, 1948, Shadrick left for [[basic training|basic combat training]] at [[Fort Knox, Kentucky]]. As he was 17 years old at the time, Shadrick had to convince his parents to papers allowing him to [[enlist]]. Shadrick completed this training in February of 1949, and sailed for [[Japan]] to join the [[34th Infantry Regiment (United States)|34th Infantry Regiment]], [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]] for [[Occupation of Japan|Post-World War II occupation duties]]. Shadrick spent a year on [[Kyushu Island]] with the division.<ref name="WVA"/> According to his family, Shadrick enjoyed his tour in Japan at first, but by June of 1950 he was growing tired of being there.<ref name="Time"/>

=== Outbreak of war ===
{{mainarticle|Korean War}}
On the night of June 25, 1950, 10 divisions of the [[North Korean People's Army]] launched a full-scale invasion on the nation's neighbor to the south, the [[Republic of Korea]]. Advancing with 89,000 men in six columns, the North Koreans caught the [[Republic of Korea Army|South Korean Army]] by surprise, resulting in a disastrous rout for the South Koreans who were disorganized, ill-equipped, and unprepared for war.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=1}}</ref> Numerically superior, North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance, pushing steadily down the peninsula against the South Koreans who could muster just 38,000 men to the front-line to oppose them.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=2}}</ref> The majority of the South Korean forces retreated in the face of the invasion, and by June 28 the North Koreans had captured the capital [[Seoul]], and forced the government and its shattered forces to withdraw further southwards.<ref>{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=2}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the [[United Nations Security Council]] voted to send assistance to the collapsing country and United States President [[Harry S. Truman]] subsequently ordered ground troops into the nation.<ref name="Var3">{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=3}}</ref> However, U.S. forces in the [[Far East]] had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II, five years earlier, and Shadrick's division was the closest to the conflict. Under the command of [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[William F. Dean]], the division was under strength and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Yet in spite of these deficiencies the division was ordered into South Korea, tasked with taking the initial "shock" of the North Korean advances until the rest of the Eighth Army could arrive and establish a defense.<ref name="Var3"/><ref>{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=14}}</ref> 

The plan was to airlift one battalion of the 24th Infantry Division into South Korea via [[C-54 Skymaster]] transport aircraft and quickly block advancing North Korean forces while the remainder of the division was transported on ships. The [[21st Infantry Regiment (United States)|21st Infantry Regiment]] was identified as the most combat-ready of the 24th Infantry Division's three regiments, and the 21st Infantry's 1st Battalion was selected because its commander, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Charles B. Smith, was the most experienced, having commanded a battalion at the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] during World War II.<ref name="USAJ">{{cite web|url=http://www.usarj.army.mil/history/tfsmith.aspx |title=Task Force Smith Informational Paper |publisher=[[United States Army Japan]] |accessdate=2009-11-29}}</ref> On July 5, [[Task Force Smith]] engaged North Korean forces at the [[Battle of Osan]], delaying over 5,000 North Korean infantry for seven hours before being routed and forced back.<ref name="Var4">{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=4}}</ref> 

During that time, the [[34th Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 34th Infantry Regiment]] set up a line between the villages of [[Pyongtaek]] and [[Ansong]], {{convert|10|mi|km}} south of Osan, to fight the next delaying action against the advancing North Korean forces.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=62}}</ref> The 34th Infantry Regiment was similarly unprepared for a fight.<ref name="Fehr74">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=74}}</ref> At this time, Shadrick was part of an [[M9A1 Bazooka]] team with 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry.<ref name="WVA"/>

=== Death ===
{{mainarticle|Battle of Pyongtaek}}
[[File:Osan Bazooka Team.jpg|alt=Two soldiers standing in brush, one aiming a bazooka|thumb|Shadrick (right) looks on as another soldier fires a bazooka, moments before his death.]]
About 90 minutes after Task Force Smith began its withdrawal from the Battle of Osan, the 34th Infantry sent Shadrick as part of a small scouting force northward to the village of Sojong-ni, {{convert|5|mi}} south of Osan.<ref name="WVA"/> The small force, under command of Lieutenant Charles E. Payne, consisted mostly of bazooka teams and infantry, and came to a graveyard in the village where it halted.<ref name="Apple78">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=78}}</ref> There, they spotted a North Korean [[T-34/85]] tank on a road to the north. Shadrick and the other bazooka operators began firing on the tank from long range at around 1600.<ref name="WVA"/> With them at the time was Sergeant Charles R. Turnbull, a US Army [[combat photographer]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/photographs/view.php?id=25072 |title=First casualty of the Korean War |publisher=[[Truman Presidential Library]] |date=2007 |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref> Turnbull asked Shadrick to time a bazooka shot so its flash could be caught in Turnbull's photograph, and Shadrick complied.<ref name="WVA"/><ref name="Apple78"/> He made the shot and counted to three before getting out of his covered area to see where the shot went, when machine gun fire from the T-34 struck Shadrick in the chest and arm, mortally wounding him. Shadrick died moments later.<ref name="Time"/>

The patrol retreated without destroying the tank, taking Shadrick's body with them. The force returned to the 34th Infantry Command post in Pyongtaek to report to [[US Brigadier General|Brigadier General]] George B. Barth and [[US Colonel|Colonel]] Harold B. Ayres, who were commanding the operation. Also present was [[Marguerite Higgins]], a [[war correspondent]] for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''. Higgins subsequently reported Shadrick's death, referring to him as the first American killed in Korea.<ref name="Apple78"/>

Shadrick's family heard of his death from a neighbor who had heard in on a radio broadcast, and the news from the Army came several days later. The family was immediately inundated with well-wishing locals and reporters, and it was revealed Shadrick's father had not even known where Korea was.<ref name="Time"/> Shadrick's body was returned to the United States, and on June 17, 1951 a funeral was held in [[Beckley, West Virginia]] which was attended by hundreds of local residents.<ref name="WVA"/> The funeral was set to coencide with the anniversary of the start of the war and Shadrick's death. His flag-draped casket was escorted down the streets of the town on a [[horse-drawn carriage]].<ref name="Life">{{cite journal |title=A Peace Move|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=m04EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=%22Kenneth+Shadrick%22&source=bl&ots=QZHAPB4QDZ&sig=E_T3krVo3bmj3nlgbFrM8Y_pn9A&hl=en&ei=XfE_TtucDsrIsQLe9JzgCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&q=%22Kenneth%20Shadrick%22&f=false |date=July 9, 1951 |journal=[[Life Magazine]] Vol. 31 No. 2 |issn=0024-3019}}</ref> Shadrick was then buried at the [[American Legion]] Cemetery.<ref name="WVA"/>

=== Misidentification ===
Higgins' account of Shadrick's death was widely published.<ref name="Har270">{{harvnb|Harrity|2005|p=270}}</ref> ''[[TIME Magazine]]'' published a story about Shadrick's death on July 17, 1950, citing Shadrick as the first "reported" death in Korea.<ref name="Time">{{citation|title=The 8 O'clock Broadcast |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,934948,00.html |publisher=[[TIME Magazine]] |date=July 17, 1950 |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref> ''[[Life Magazine]]'' reported Shadrick for up to a year as the first US soldier to die in the war.<ref name="Life"/> Publications have continued to report Shadrick as the first US infantryman killed in the war,<ref>{{harvnb|Harrity|2005|p=43}}</ref> and the claim was made as recently as July 4, 2011 in the [[Huntington, West Virginia]] local newspaper, ''[[The Herald-Dispatch]]''.<ref>{{citation|title=This Week in West Virginia History |url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/news/x2067712/This-week-in-West-Virginia-History |publisher=''[[The Herald-Dispatch]]'' |date=July 4, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref>

American Legion Post 133 erected a monument to Shadrick at the [[Wyoming County, West Virginia]] courthouse. The monument cites Shadrick's unit, date of death, and notes him as the "first casualty of the Korean conflict" with an [[epitaph]] that reads, "He stands first in the unbroken line of patriots who have dared to die that freedom might live, grow and increase its blessings. Freedom lives and through it he lives <U+2014> in a way that humbles the undertakings of most men."<ref>{{harvnb|Robinson|2005|p=49}}</ref> It is one of several memorials to local residents who served in the military.<ref>{{harvnb|Robinson|2005|p=41}}</ref>

Subsequent publications shed doubt on the accuracy of these claims. Eyewitness accounts at the Battle of Osan point to the first death as a machine gunner in the [[21st Infantry Regiment (United States)|21st Infantry Regiment]], who had been killed around 0830 that morning when a different T-34 tank was disabled at the battle and one of the crewmembers attacked with a [[PPSh-41|PPSh-41 "Burp Gun"]]. However, in the subsequent confusion of the battle, many of the wounded and dead troops were left behind at the battle, and a large number were also captured. Consequently, the identity of this soldier remains a mystery, and sources that disagree on Shadrick's death as the first of the Korean War do not know who actually holds that claim.<ref name="Har270"/><ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=69}}</ref>
