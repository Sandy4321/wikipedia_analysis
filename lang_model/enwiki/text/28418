==Life==
She was born '''Sheila Martin Doherty''' at [[New Westminster, British Columbia]]. She grew up on the grounds of the provincial [[mental hospital]] where her father, Dr. Charles Edward Doherty, was the superintendent until his death in 1922.<ref name=jrank>Frank Davey, "[http://www.jrank.org/literature/pages/8873/Sheila-Watson.html Sheila Watson Biography]," Encyclopedia of Literature, 8873, Web, Apr. 22, 2011.</ref>

After studying at Vancouver's Convent of the Sacred Heart, Sheila Doherty finished her university studies at the [[University of British Columbia]], where she received her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1931 and [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1933. She then worked as an elementary and high school teacher throughout [[British Columbia]] &ndash; including two years in [[Dog Creek, British Columbia|Dog Creek]] (1935<U+2013>1937), which served as a basis for her first novel, ''Deep Hollow Creek.''<ref name=jrank/> She married [[Canadian poetry|Canadian poet]] [[Wilfred Watson]] in 1941.<ref name=athabasca/>

Sheila Watson taught at Moulton Ladies College in Toronto between 1946 and 1948. From 1948 to 1950 she was a sessional lecturer at the [[University of British Columbia]].<ref name=jrank/>

Watson wrote ''The Double Hook'' between 1952 and 1954 in Calgary and revised it during a year-long stay in Paris,<ref name=mcmaster/> from 1955 to 1956.<ref name=wilfred>"[http://archive1.macs.ualberta.ca/FindingAids/WilfredWatson/WWatson.html Biography of Wilfred Watson]," Wilfred Watson Fonds Finding Aid, UAlberta.ca, Web, Apr. 22, 2011.</ref> 
She was unable to find a publisher. "[[T.S. Eliot]] at [[Faber & Faber]], [[C. Day Lewis]] at [[Chatto & Windus]], and [[Rupert Hart-Davis]] all turned it down."<ref name=mcmaster/>

In 1957 Watson began doctoral studies at the [[University of Toronto]], writing her thesis on [[Wyndham Lewis]] under the direction of [[Marshall McLuhan]]. Her doctoral dissertation, ''Wyndham Lewis and Expressionism'' was finally completed in 1965.<ref name=athabasca/> By then, though, Watson was already well known in Canadian academe.

In 1959 ''The Double Hook'' was published, and instantly recognized as a modern classic. "All 3,000 copies of the initial print run were sold. Supporters such as ... McLuhan, as well as [[Yale]] formalist [[Cleanth Brooks]], saw it as a literary landmark ushering the Canadian novel out of its regional confines. Professor Fred Salter ... called it 'the most brilliant piece of fiction ever written in Canada'."<ref name=mcmaster>"John Rendell Smith, "[http://hpcanpub.mcmaster.ca/case-study/how-sheila-watson-s-double-hook-caught How Sheila Watson<U+2019>s The Double Hook Caught On],' Historical Perspectives on Canadian Publishing, McMasterU.ca, Web, Apr. 22, 2011.</ref>

The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] approached Watson to option the film rights to ''The Double Hook.'' However, because they would not give her veto rights over the script, she turned them down.<ref name=mcmaster/>

In 1961, Watson was hired as a professor of English at the [[University of Alberta]]. "In [[Edmonton]] the Watsons became part of an active circle of writers and established the literary magazine,''The White Pelican'' in 1970 along with [[Douglas Barbour]], [[Stephen Scobie]], [[John Orrell]], [[Dorothy Livesay]], and artist Norman Yates."<ref name=athabasca>"[http://canadian-writers.athabascau.ca/english/writers/swatson/swatson.php Sheila Watson]," English-Canadian Writers, AthabascaU.ca, Web, Apr. 22, 2011.</ref> Watson remained the founding editor of the ''White Pelican'' for its brief existence (1971<U+2013>1975).<ref name=scobie/> White Pelican Publications published ''Lions at her Face,'' the first book by [[Miriam Mandel]], which won the Governor General's Award in [[1973 Governor General's Awards|1973]].

In 1984 Watson edited the ''Collected Poems of Miriam Mandel.''<ref name=biblio>"[http://canadian-writers.athabascau.ca/english/writers/swatson/biblio_by.php Bibliography of Works by Sheila Watson]," English-Canadian Writers, AthabascaU.ca, Web, Apr. 22, 2011.</ref>
Watson retired in 1975. In 1976, she and her husband moved to Nanaimo, where they died in 1998.<ref name=athabasca/>

==Writing==
{{Main|The Double Hook}}

Watson is best known for her modernist [[novel]] '''''The Double Hook''''' (1959), which is considered "a seminal work in the development of contemporary [[Canadian literature]]."<ref name=fonds/> "''[[The Double Hook]]'' presents in concise, [[symbol]]ic terms a drama of social disintegration and [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]], set in an isolated BC community....  These themes are presented in a style which itself balances on a "double hook": it is simultaneously local and universal, realistic and symbolic."<ref name=scobie/>

Watson has said the "double hook" of her title refers to the idea <U+201C>that when you fish for the glory you catch the darkness too. That if you hook twice the glory you hook twice the fear.<U+201D><ref name=mcmaster/> She explained that her novel is "about how people are driven, how if they have no art, how if they have no tradition, how if they have no ritual, they are driven in one of 2 ways, either towards violence or towards insensibility - if they have no mediating rituals which manifest themselves in what I suppose we call art forms."<ref name=scobie/>

In 1992 Watson published a novel, '''''Deep Hollow Creek''''', which she had written in the 1930s. It was shortlisted that year for the [[Governor General's Award]]. "''Deep Hollow Creek'' treats many of the same themes" as ''The Double Hook'' "in a manner which is more direct and conventional, but no less elliptical and challenging. It is fascinating to imagine the ways in which Canadian fiction might have been transformed if this startling and brilliant novel had been published at the time of its first composition."<ref name=scobie/>

In the 1950s Watson published three interlinked stories, and a fourth in 1970, dealing with the family of [[Sophocles]]' [[Oedipus]] in a contemporary, realistic setting. The most critically discussed of these is "[http://books.google.ca/books?id=7utOftgVgJ4C&pg=PA241#v=onepage&q&f=false Antigone]", a setting of the story of [[Creon]] and [[Antigone]] in the wilds of British Columbia.

==Recognition==
Watson was awarded the [[Royal Society of Canada]]'s [[Lorne Pierce Medal]] in 1984.<ref name=scobie/>

The third epigraph of Canadian novelist [[Margaret Atwood]]'s 2000 novel ''[[The Blind Assassin]]'' reads:
{{cquote|The word is a flame burning in a dark glass. &ndash; ''Sheila Watson''}}
According to Nathalie Cooke, this is from ''Deep Hollow Creek'', and it announces Atwood's third dominant theme, the power of the word itself.
