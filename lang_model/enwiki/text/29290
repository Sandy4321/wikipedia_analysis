'''Eurydice''' (in [[Greek language|Greek]] '''E<U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03C5><U+03B4><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03B7>''') was the daughter of [[Antipater]] and the wife of [[Ptolemy I Soter]], who was thought to be the son of [[Lagus]], a [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] nobleman, or the illegitimate son of [[Philip II of Macedon]] (which, if true, would have made Ptolomy half-brother to [[Alexander the Great]]). The period of her marriage is not mentioned by any ancient writer, but it is probable that it took place shortly after the [[Treaty of Triparadisus|partition of Triparadisus]], and the appointment of Antipater to the [[regent|regency]] in [[321 BC]]. 

She was the mother of three sons: [[Ptolemy Keraunos]], [[Meleager (king)|Meleager]], who succeeded his brother on the throne of [[Macedon]]ia and a third child, whose name is unknown, who was put to death by [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], who was the illegitimate son of Ptolemy I Soter and Bernice. Eurydice also had two daughters; Ptolemais, who married [[Demetrius I of Macedon]]{{r|plut1_32_46}} (who was also married to Eurydice's sister [[Phila (daughter of Antipater)|Phila]], and [[Lysandra]], the wife of [[Agathocles (son of Lysimachus)|Agathocles]],who was the son of [[Lysimachus]] and [[Nicaea of Macedon|Nicaea]].{{r|paus_1.9}} <ref>Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan.

ISBN 0-500-05128-3</ref><ref>[http://www.tyndalehouse.com/Egypt/ptolemies/eurydice_fr.htm Eurydice] by Chris Bennett</ref> Ptolemy I Soter, according to the customs of the day, had several [[concubine]]s and latterly neglected Euydice for [[Berenice I of Egypt|Berenice]]{{r|plut2_4}}.  It was probably from resentment on this account, and for the preference shown to the children of Berenice, that she withdrew from the court of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. In [[287 BC]] she was residing at [[Miletus]], where she welcomed [[Demetrius I of Macedon]], and gave him her daughter for marriage. This was great offense to Ptolemy I Soter as he and Demetrius were political enemies, having fought wars against each other, and Demetrius having conquered and captured much of Ptolemy's [[sovereignty|sovereign]].{{r|plut1_46}}
