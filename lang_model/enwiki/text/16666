The '''Ashton Court Festival''' was an outdoor [[music festival]] held annually in the grounds of [[Ashton Court]], just outside [[Bristol]], [[England]], in mid-July. The festival was a weekend event which featured a variety of local bands and national headliners. As it was mainly aimed at local residents, the festival was not widely promoted, nor were there overnight camping facilities.

Starting as a small one day festival in 1974, the festival grew during succeeding years, being claimed as Britain's largest free festival, until changes brought in by [[Licensing Act 2003|government legislation]] meant that compulsory fees and security fencing had to be introduced. After problems brought on by a temporary move to [[Hengrove#Hengrove Park|Hengrove Park]] in 2001, due to the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|foot and mouth crisis]], and a washout in 2007, the organisers declared bankruptcy in 2007.

The main stage was placed at the bottom of the slope and the second stage in a natural [[amphitheatre]] near the entrance to the clearing. There was also a dance tent, marquees for [[world music]], [[acoustic instrument|acoustic]] acts and [[performing arts]], and the "Blackout" tent for experimental music and video, as well as a children's area and funfair rides. In 2007, the festival's last year, the site was moved to Smythe's field in front of Ashton Court Mansion.<ref>{{cite web

Although locals have long referred to the festival as the "Ashton Court Festival", before 2004 it was officially called the '''Bristol Community Festival'''. During the late 1980s, the Ashton Court event was only one element of a two-week-long, city-wide festival. Since then it became increasingly popular, and for several years it was claimed to be Britain's biggest free festival;<ref name="EP2003" /> however, the "suggested minimum donation" for entry become a gradually increasing compulsory entry fee. From 2007, children (aged 10 - 16) also had to pay an entry fee, while under 10s remained free (previously all children got in free), and a new discounted weekend ticket became available. The festival was typically attended by over 60,000 people annually.<ref name="EP2003" />

In 2001 the Bristol Community Festival temporarily relocated to [[Hengrove Park]] in the south of the city. [[Ashton Court]] Estate, which includes a [[deer]] park, was closed as a [[quarantine]] measure due to the [[2001 UK foot and mouth crisis|outbreak]] of [[foot and mouth disease]] that affected the [[United Kingdom]] that year. The move caused a massive drop in attendance and a heavy financial loss, leading to debts which hung over the organisation.<ref>{{cite news

 |title=Bright future for Ashton Court Festival  |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |last=Staff |date=26 July 2002 |accessdate=3 May 2010 }}</ref> This, along with changes to licensing laws and tightening health and safety requirements, led to a more commercial style of organisation, with a compulsory entrance fee and a strict security presence around the [[perimeter fence]]. This attracted criticism from some locals who felt that the "community" nature of the festival had been lost. Even so, the festival continued to be run by volunteers on a not-for-profit basis.

The festival's music policy always focused on local acts, but since the late 1990s there was a move towards attracting national acts to headline the festival. Major acts at Ashton Court in recent years include:<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.p4ft.co.uk/bcf.htm |title=Bristol Community Festival - Ashton Court Festival - Line ups 1994 - 2007 |work=p4ft.co.uk |accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref>

In 2003 the weight and vibrations of crowds returning from the Ashton Court Festival and the [[Bristol International Balloon Fiesta]] put such a great strain on the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]] that the Bridge Trustees decided to close the bridge to all traffic, including pedestrians, for the entirety of the festival and most of the Balloon Fiesta in 2004 and 2005.<ref>{{cite news  |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/3894167.stm |title=Hundreds queue for festival buses |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=18 July 2004 |last=Staff |accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref> 

In December 2006 it was announced that the festival was in financial crisis and there was uncertainty over whether the 2007 festival would take place.<ref name="BBC-cash">{{cite news

 |title=City festival needs public cash|date=20 December 2006|last=Staff
 |work=BBC News|publisher=Bristol |accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref> The festival planning went ahead with support and donations from a number of Bristol businesses. In June 2007 it was announced that alcohol would not be allowed to be taken on site, but would be available to purchase from official bars within the arena. Also, that everyone attending the festival would be searched on the way in. This announcement caused much controversy.<ref>{{cite web

The 2007 festival was cancelled on the second day due to torrential rain, which made the site inaccessible to emergency vehicles. "The health and safety of our audience is what is important," said organiser Steve Hunt.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/6899427.stm |title=BBC NEWS | England | Bristol | Rain forces festival cancellation |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=15 July 2007|last=Staff |accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref> Over 80 bands were due to perform that day including [[Damon Albarn]]'s The Good, the Bad and the Queen. This cancellation increased the pressure on the already strained finances of the festival.  On Friday 20 July 2007 Bristol Community Festival Ltd, the not-for-profit company which organised the event, announced that it had started the process of winding up the company due to unsustainable financial losses.<ref name="BBC-Festivalend">{{cite news

==Legacy==
Following the end of Bristol Community Festival, other groups emerged hoping to continue with some sort of summer festival in Bristol.<ref name="BBC-Festivalend" /> Bristol Music Festival became the Bristol Festival and has so far successfully put on two summer festivals, albeit in the city centre.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thebristolfestival.org/about-us
