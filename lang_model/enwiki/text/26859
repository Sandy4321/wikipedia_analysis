==History==
=== Beginnings ===
[[Billy Bob Thornton]], credited on the band's material as 'W. R. Thornton', has remarked that "I never intended to become a movie star... It happened accidentally. I appreciate it because I'm able to make a good living for my family, but other than that, it seems like a job to me. Music is what I love."<ref name=style/> Before his acting career started, he played in [[cover band]]s for [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] and [[ZZ Top]]. He released a record with a band called "Hot Lanta" in 1974.<ref name=real>{{cite news | url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/entertainment/stories.nsf/peopleinthenews/story/1CA10626AFF7618686257491000FBC80?OpenDocument | title=Billy Bob Thornton rocks, for real | publisher=San Antonio Express-News | author= Jim Beal Jr.| date=2008-07-26}}</ref> He also worked as a [[roadie]] with [[the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], [[Johnny Paycheck]], and [[Blood, Sweat, and Tears]].<ref name=return>{{cite news|url=http://www.spinner.com/2008/06/02/billy-bob-thornton-returns-to-music-with-the-boxmasters/|title=Billy Bob Thornton Returns to Music With the Boxmasters|first=David |late=Chiu|publisher=[[Spinner.com]]|date=June, 2 2008}}</ref> Over his acting career, he released four solo albums from 2001 to 2007.<ref name=mod>[http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/ent-life/billy_bob_and_the_boxmasters_bring_modbilly_to_beaumont_friday_03-19-2009.html Billy Bob and the Boxmasters bring modbilly to Beaumont Friday].

He got the idea for creating The Boxmasters after listening to the [[Chad and Jeremy]] [[folk pop]] [[hit record|hit]] 'Yesterday's Gone', which he thought could be made into a great [[hillbilly music|hillbilly]] [[cover (music)|cover]]. He then thought about going further by taking [[British Invasion]] [[pop music|pop songs]] and turning them into Americanized [[hillbilly music|hillbilly]]/[[country music|country]] songs. According to [[Billy Bob Thornton|Thornton]], his music has been infulenced by [[Mike Nesmith]], [[the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], [[the Byrds]], and [[Gram Parsons]].<ref name=style/>

Thornton brought in sound engineer J.D. Andrew to help with his album "Beautiful Door." After [[Jam session|jamming]] together and finding a common sound, they started to record some of their material. Andrew had known Mike Butler "for six or seven years" and called him up to play guitar for them. According to Andrew, after the trio played together, he remarked that "Shoot, this sounds like a band." The three came up with the name "Boxmasters" after a piece of [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[slang]], which they later described by saying "remember the bad boy in high school who got all the girls and left a trail of broken hearts ... and more?"<ref name=mod/> Thornton had also briefly played in [[country music|country]] star [[Porter Wagoner]]'s similarly-titled band 'The Wagonmasters'.<ref>[http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1594027/billy-bob-thornton-crosses-musical-boundaries-with-boxmasters.jhtml Billy Bob Thornton Crosses Musical Boundaries With Boxmasters].

=== Career ===
The band started in [[Bellflower, California]] in 2007. During its early days, the band played several live shows in the [[California]] area, as well as in [[Tecate, Mexico]].<ref name=style/><ref name=all>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:hcfwxzt5ldae~T1|title=The Boxmasters|publisher= [[Allmusic.com]]|accessdate= April 12, 2009|last= True|first=Chris}}</ref> Their eponymous first [[album]] ''The Boxmasters'' was released on June 10, 2008 with [[Vanguard Records]]. It received a mostly poor review from [[Allmusic.com]], which stated that "The Boxmasters might work live because there will be visuals; but merely as a listening exercise, it's best taken in small doses so the novelty doesn't wear off." The review also alleged that "Thornton can't drum to save his life, and he can't sing".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:dnfexzrjld6e|title=The Boxmasters - The Boxmasters|publisher= [[Allmusic.com]]|accessdate= April 12, 2009|last= Jurek|first=Thom}}</ref>

The group resumed [[tour (music)|touring]] in July 2008.<ref name=return/> From 2008 to 2009, the group played in [[Canada]] and in the [[United States]] alongside [[musicians]] Bradley Davis on [[mandolin]], [[guitar]], and [[vocalist|vocals]], [[Teddy Andreadis]] on [[harmonica]] and [[organ (music)|organ]], and Mike Bruce on [[drums]].<ref name=all/> The band released their second album, ''Christmas Cheer'', in November 11, 2008, also through [[Vanguard Records]]. [[Allmusic.com]] gave another critical review, calling the music "an acquired taste".<ref>{{web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:gxfwxz9kldae|title=The Boxmasters - Christmas Cheer|publisher= [[Allmusic.com]]|accessdate= April 12, 2009|last= Jurek|first=Thom}}</ref>

The band released, through Vanguard as well, ''Modbilly'' on April 21, 2009. ''[[Houston Press]]'' praised the album, saying that it "confirms that Billy Bob Thornton's writing talents aren't confined to his Oscar-winning screenplays."<ref>[http://blogs.houstonpress.com/rocks/2009/04/listening_room_whats_been_tick.php Listening Room: What's Been Tickling Our Earholes Lately].

''[[Prefix (disambiguation)|Prefix]]''. Published April 22, 2009.</ref>

The group has [[cover (music)|covered]] [[the Beatles]], [[the Who]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Turtles]], and [[Mott the Hoople]] in its unique style. It also plays original songs, mostly written or co-written by Thornton based on the "[[white trash]]" figures he had seen in his [[Arkansas]] [[Billy_Bob_Thornton#Early_life|childhood]]. ''[[The Montreal Gazette]]'' has called his original material "at turns dark and funny, with world-class hooks".<ref name=style/> The members play while wearing well-dressed '[[Mod_(lifestyle)#Fashion|Mod]]' outfits such as [[tailor]]ed black [[Suit (clothing)|suits]], white shirts, and narrow black [[neckties]].<ref name=sour/>

Aside from playing, Thornton has said that he plans on creating [[comic books]] based on him and other band members. Plots would involve the band coming to the aid of townspeople as they tour. He said, "We're not sure what our superpowers are going to be yet".<ref>[http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/billy-bob-thornton-becomes-a-boxmaster-158289 Billy Bob Thornton becomes a Boxmaster].

==Touring and controversy==
In April 2009, the band was scheduled to tour across [[Canada]], [[opening act|opening]] for [[country music]] veterans [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Ray Price]].<ref name=style/><ref name=sour/> On April 8, the band appeared on the national [[CBC Radio One]] program ''[[Q (radio show)|Q]]'', hosted by [[Jian Ghomeshi]]. During the first half of the interview, Thornton sounded nervous and confused, giving erratic answers, such as "I don't know" when asked how long the band had been together. When asked about his musical tastes and influences as a child, he gave his longest answer, but it was about his favorite magazine ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]''. He also stated that he had "instructed" the shows producers to not ask any questions about his career as a screenwriter and actor.<ref>[http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2009/04/09/Thornton-obnoxious-in-CBC-interview/UPI-76871239285658/ Thornton obnoxious in CBC interview].

Ghomeshi, in introducing the band, mentioned the acting credentials of Thornton, but never based his questions to Thornton about his show business career. Thornton, who was visibly upset, then complained about Canadians in general to a national radio audience since they didn't get up and move or throw things at each other, referring to Canadians to being like '[[mashed potatoes]] without the [[gravy]].' This caused an outpouring of criticism from across Canada and around the world for the star's behavior.<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6067668.ece Billy Bob Thornton does a Joaquin Phoenix on Canadian radio], [[Times Online]], April 9, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/04/08/billy-bob-thornton-attempts-to-outdo-joaquin-phoenix-in-cbc-interview/ Billy Bob Thornton Attempts To Outdo Joaquin Phoenix In CBC Interview] By Daniel Kreps.

The following night, the band opened for [[Willie Nelson]] at [[Toronto]]'s prestigious [[Massey Hall]]. A series of boos and catcalls erupted mid-set, with people in the audience yelling "here comes the gravy!" when Thornton unsuccessfully tried to explain he liked Canadians but not the popular CBC radio host.<ref>[http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/616601 Billy Bob not done with the barbs].

Thornton said that band members had come down with the "[[flu|the flu]]". Willie Nelson's publicist had no comment.<ref name=ends>[http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/616913 Billy Bob ends Canadian tour]. ''[[Toronto Star]]''. Published April 10, 2009.</ref>

The band resumed touring in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] on April 14.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/arts/music/13arts-THORNTONSBAN_BRF.html?ref=arts Thornton<U+2019>s Band Calls in Sick].

Published April 12, 2009.</ref> In the aftermath of the controversy, Thornton appeared on '''[[Jimmy_Kimmel#Jimmy_Kimmel_Live.21|Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''' and he said, "The fact that that was news was astounding to me... But it gave humpbacked geeks all over the world something to do for a couple of days." He added that he only wants to be perceived as a musician in the context of the band, remarking that "I'm just in their band, I'm just one of those guys".<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20274222,00.html?xid=rss-topheadlines VIDEO: Billy Bob Thornton 'Astounded' by Interview Fallout].
