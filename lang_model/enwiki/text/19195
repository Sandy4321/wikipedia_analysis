'''Aufwuchs''' is a term used to cover the small animals and plants that encrust hard substrates, such as rocks, in aquatic environments. The name comes from [[German_language|German]] and means a growth. In both marine and freshwater environments, [[alga]]e, particularly [[green alga]]e and [[diatom]]s make up the dominant component of aufwuchs communities. Small [[crustacean]]s, [[rotifer]]s, and [[protozoa]]ns are also commonly found in fresh water and the sea, but [[insects|insect larvae]], [[Oligochaeta|oligochaetes]] and [[tardigrade]]s are peculiar to freshwater aufwuchs faunas.

Many aquatic animals feed extensively on aufwuchs. The [[mbuna]] [[cichlid]]s from [[Lake Malawi]] are particularly well known examples of fish adapted for feeding on aufwuchs. Examples include ''[[Labeotropheus trewavasae]]'' and ''[[Pseudotropheus zebra]]''. They have scraper-like teeth that allow them to rasp the aufwuchs from rocks [http://malawicichlids.com/mw01100.htm#aufw]. In marine communities, aufwuchs is an important source of food for animals such as [[limpet]]s and [[sea urchin]]s.
