== History ==

The company was founded by German pilot instructor Bernd Walter, who still is the owner and [[CEO]] of LGW, at [[Dortmund]] Wickede Airport in [[1980]]. At the outset the small company offered flights to German [[North Sea]] islands, sightseeing-flights and flight-training with a single [[Cessna 206|Cessna U 206 "Stationair"]]. In [[1988]] LGW expanded with buying a [[Britten-Norman Islander]] for the [[North Sea]] flights. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

After [[German reunification]] LGW was one of the first German airlines which started flights from [[West Germany]] to the former [[German Democratic Republic]]. LGW connected with [[Cessna 404]] Dortmund with [[Berlin]], [[Erfurt]] and other cities in former [[East Germany]]. As of [[1992]] the fleet was replaced by [[Dornier Do 228]]. In the meantime LGW took up new routes (e.g. from/to [[Hanover]], [[Paderborn]]/[[Lippstadt]] or [[Rostock]]/[[Laage]]) and has become one of the biggest [[European regional airlines|regional airlines]] in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. In recent years LGW took over many routes, which was left by other [[airlines]], e.g. the route Dortmund-[[Nuremberg]] (in 2002, ex. [[Eurowings]]), Dortmund-[[Stuttgart]] (in 2003, ex. [[European Air Express]]) and Dortmund-[[Tempelhof International Airport|Berlin-Tempelhof]] (in 2004, ex. [[City Air Germany]]). {{Fact|date=February 2007}}
