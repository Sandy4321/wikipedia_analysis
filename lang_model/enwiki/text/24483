'''Wales Millennium Centre''' ({{lang-cy|Canolfan Mileniwm Cymru}}) is an [[arts centre]] located in the [[Cardiff Bay]] area of [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]]. The site covers a total area of {{convert|4.7|acre}}.<ref name="Sell" /> Phase 1 of the building was opened during the weekend of the 26&ndash;28 November 2004 and phase 2 opened on 22 January 2009 with an inaugural concert. The centre has hosted performances of [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[dance]], [[comedy]] and [[musical theater|musicals]]. 

The venue, which also has a nickname locally as the ''Armadillo'',<ref name="Torchwood"/><ref name="Armadillo">{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4041707.stm |publisher= [[BBC]]|title= Have Your Say - Wales Millennium Centre |accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref> comprises one large theatre and two smaller halls. It also includes shops, bars and restaurants. The Centre is home to the national opera, dance, theatre and literature companies of Wales, as well as the national orchestra. In total, the Centre has eight arts organisations in residence.<ref name="Tenants"/>  
The main theatre, the Donald Gordon Theatre, holds 1,897 people, the BBC Hoddinott Hall holds 350 people and the Weston Studio Theatre holds 250 people.<ref name="Function">{{cite web |url= http://www.wmc.org.uk/index.cfm?UUID=A4D665A5-AAD6-393C-45B96FD2745D3D47 |publisher= Wales Millennium Centre|title=Function rooms|accessdate=2008-03-04}}</ref> 

In 2001 [[David Rowe-Beddoe, Baron Rowe-Beddoe|Lord Rowe-Beddoe]] was appointed the Chairman of Wales Millennium Centre, which is a [[company limited by guarantee]], and he remains in this post today. [[Michael Checkland|Sir Michael Checkland]] is also a Board member.

== Background ==
=== Cardiff Bay Opera House ===
{{main|Cardiff Bay Opera House}}

The Centre is the successor to a previous project on the site, the Cardiff Bay Opera House. This was a plan, supported by the [[Cardiff Bay Development Corporation]], to construct a permanent home for the [[Welsh National Opera]].<ref name="Airlines">{{cite web |url= http://americanairlines.wcities.com/en/guide/entertainment/7/guide.html  |publisher=[[American Airlines]] |title= Entertainment |accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref>  However, the project failed to win financial support from the [[Millennium Commission]], the body which distributed funds from the UK [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]].   

==== International competition ====
An international design competition was established by the Cardiff Bay Opera House Trust to decide on the architect for the project. The competition would eventually be in two rounds. The first round of the competition attracted 268 international competitors.<ref name="Observer">{{cite web |url= http://arts.guardian.co.uk/art/architecture/story/0,,2263977,00.html |publisher= [[Guardian Media Group]] |title= Zaha Hadid |accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref> The list of architectural practices that took part in the competition included [[Itsuko Hasegawa]], [[Mario Botta]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Rafael Moneo]], Manfredi Nicoletti, Pietro Marcozzi Architect, Rusli Associates, [[Percy Thomas|Percy Thomas Partnership]] and [[Greg Lynn|Greg Lynn FORM]].<ref name="Building">{{cite web |url= http://www.bdonline.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=3089962|publisher=Building Design|title=Diva Zaha steals the show in Cardiff Bay |accessdate=2008-03-04}}</ref><ref name="Pietro">{{cite web |url= http://www.pietromarcozzi.it/scheda%20cardiff.htm  |publisher= www.pietromarcozzi.it |title= International Architectural Competition Cardiff Bay Opera House |accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref><ref name="Greg">{{cite web |url= http://www.basilisk.com/C/CARDIFF_608.html |publisher= BASILISK |title= Cardiff Bay Opera House |accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref><ref name="Rusli Associates">{{cite web |url= http://www.rusli.com/cdfAxo.html |publisher= Rusli Associates |title= Cardiff Bay Opera House, Wales, United Kingdom 1994 |accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref>  It was won by Iraq-born architect [[Zaha Hadid]]. Her [[avant-garde]] design was radical glass structure that surrounded the main theatre. However, her design was so radical that [[Nicholas Edwards, Baron Crickhowell|Lord Crickhowell]] as chair of the Cardiff Bay Opera House Trust, asked Hadid to submit her design again along with [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster + Partners]] and Manfredi Nicoletti, who were asked to submit revised designs, for a second round of competition.<ref name="Net">{{cite web |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960114/ai_n9636266 |publisher= [[CNET Networks]], Inc. |title= A monumental spot of local trouble |accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref>  But she won this round too.<ref name="Building" />

==== Aftermath ====
The decision by Millennium Commission to reject the bid for [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|lottery money]] was announced on 22 December 1995.<ref name="Times" />  Many claim that the bid failed because of the widespread unpopularity of the Millennium Commission's support for the [[Royal Opera House]] in [[London]], which was seen as elitist.<ref name="Nicholas">{{cite web |url= http://www.metropolismag.com/html/content_0498/ap98carf.htm |publisher= METROPOLIS |title= Opera House Lottery: Zaha Hadid and the Cardiff Bay Project by Nicholas Crickhowell |accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref>  Others say that the project was destroyed by conservatism and provincialism in relation to the modern architecture, and by [[Cardiff Council]]'s support for the [[Millennium Stadium]].

[[Virginia Bottomley]], [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport|Secretary of State for National Heritage]], announced in a news conference that the project was flawed by uncertainties in the building's financing and construction, which made it the project too risky. Lord Crickhowell interrupted that news conference to denounce the rejection. He said the decision was "...shocking and incomprehensible...If this had been a project in London, it would be getting backing...You can understand the annoyance of people in Wales that we can't get the kind of vitally important projects that London seems to be allowed."<ref name="Times">{{cite web |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DEED91539F936A15751C1A963958260 |publisher= [[New York Times]] |title= Britain Rejects Welsh Opera's Plea for Financing|accessdate=2008-03-04}}</ref>

=== Origins of Wales Millennium Centre ===
After the Cardiff Bay Opera House project was rejected, a new project was conceived that included more than opera and was felt to be a better reflection of Welsh culture. The change of name symbolised this, but the project still had to overcome many hurdles. Funding from the [[Welsh Assembly]] and Millennium Commission took years to obtain. Cardiff Council had to buy the land after the previous owners, Grosvenor Waterside ([[Associated British Ports Holdings|Associated British Ports]] property division) threatened to built a retail centre there due to the delays.<ref name="Sell">{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1002523.stm |publisher=[[BBC]] |title= Plans to sell Millennium Centre site|accessdate=2008-03-04}}</ref><ref name="Saved">{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/945475.stm |publisher= [[BBC]] |title= Wales Millennium Centre site 'saved' |accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref>  Further boosts were given by large donations from South African businessman [[Donald Gordon (South African businessman)|Donald Gordon]] and a loan from the international bank, [[HSBC]]. The GB<U+00A3>20 million donation from Donald Gordon was split evenly between the Royal Opera House and Wales Millennium Centre and was spread over five years. This is believed to be the largest single private donation ever made to the arts in the UK.<ref name="Gordon">{{cite web |url= http://www.donaldgordon.org/projects/royalop.htm |publisher= Donald Gordon Foundation

== Phase 1 &ndash; Donald Gordon Theatre and Weston Studio Theatre ==
[[Image:1999 sketches of WMC.jpg|thumb|The 1999 sketch of the Wales Millennium Centre by Jonathan Adams]] 

In addition to the two main theatres of the Donald Gordon Theatre and Weston Studio Theatre, the {{convert|37000|m2|adj=on}} phase 1 of the Wales Millennium Centre also has six function rooms: the Victor Salvi Room, the David Morgan Room, the Sony Room, the Seligman Room, the Japan Room and Function Room 6.<ref name="Function" /> The [[Urdd Gobaith Cymru]] houses a 140-bed hostel, as well as performance and teaching space. The Urdd Hall has 153 retractable seats and is under the control of the Urdd Gobaith Cymru.<ref name="Centre">{{cite web |url= http://www.wmc.org.uk/index.cfm?UUID=198213CE-F3AF-D847-31B23075815D1592|publisher= Wales Millennium Centre |title= Theatrical Productions |accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref>

The building also includes rehearsal rooms, orchestral facilities for the Welsh National Opera, dance studios for Diversions, called The Dance House, and the Blue Room, with seating for up to 100. 

The [[foyer]] has three bars; the Penderyn Awen Foyer Bar on level 2, the Horizons Foyer Bar on level 4, and the Stones Foyer Bar on level 5.<ref name="Bar">{{cite web |url= http://www.wmc.org.uk/index.cfm?UUID=D16F0F2B-65B8-F208-57361988A23573A3|publisher= Wales Millennium Centre |title= Eat, drink, shop|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> Gilby's @ the Bay, which is a restaurant, is also situated in the foyer, along Crema, which is a coffee shop, Hufen, which is an Ice cream parlour and One, which is a wine bar.<ref name="Bar"/> Free performances also take place during the day in the foyer on the Glanfa Stage.<ref name="Stage">{{cite web |url= http://www.wmc.org.uk/index.cfm?alias=events|publisher= Wales Millennium Centre |title= Enjoy free performances|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref>

=== Design and construction ===
The Centre was designed by Jonathan Adams, of local architects, Capita [[Percy Thomas]], with [[Arup|Arup Acoustics]] providing the acoustic design. His first concept drawings were made in the early 1998,<ref name="Adams">{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/wmc/pages/jonathan_adams.shtml |publisher= [[BBC Wales]] |title= Building for the Nation|accessdate=2008-03-13}}</ref> by 1999 his design was starting to look more like the building it is today.  
[[Image:Wales Millennium Centre and Senedd under construction.jpg|thumb|left|During construction of phase 1]] 

Construction began on 25 February 2002, the main contractor being [[Sir Robert McAlpine]] Ltd<ref name="McAlpine">{{cite web |url= http://www.newswales.co.uk/index.php?section=Culture&F=1&id=5348
|publisher=goholidays.net|title=Work starts on Wales Millennium Centre |accessdate=2008-02-07}}</ref> and Kelsey Roofing Industries Ltd being the roofing contractor.<ref name="Kelsey">{{cite web |url= http://www.whitbybird.com/projects/project.asp?id=344 |publisher=Ramboll Whitbybird Limited |title=Wales Millennium Centre roof windload analysis |accessdate=2008-02-07}}</ref>  Carr and Angier were the theatre consultants.<ref name="Design"/>  Other contractors included Stent (foundations), [[Swansea Metropolitan University|Swansea Institute]] (glass), GH James Cyf ([[stonemasonry]]), Rimex ([[stainless steel]]), [[Alfred McAlpine]] (slate), Coed Cymru (wood), Ann Catrin Evans ([[door furniture]]), Amber Hiscott ([[etching]]s on glass walls).<ref name="Design"/>  

The architect's concept of the building was to design a building that expressed "Welshness" and that was instantly recognisable.<ref name="Design">{{cite web |url= http://www.designbuild-network.com/projects/wales/|publisher=SPG Media Limited |title=Wales Millennium Centre |accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref>  The building was designed to reflect the many different parts of Wales with local Welsh materials that dominate its history; slate, metal, wood and glass.<ref name="Materials">{{cite web |url= http://www.wmc.org.uk/index.cfm?UUID=D18D5819-65B8-F208-5507AC05466044E0|publisher=Wales Millennium Centre |title=Vision - Unmistakably Welsh and internationally outstanding |accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref>  All the materials used come from [[Wales]] and was built from 1,350 [[metric tonne|tonnes]] of Welsh slate, 300,000 [[concrete]] blocks, a million metres of electric cable.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite web |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2004/nov/27/arts.artsnews |publisher= [[The Guardian]] |title= Arts opening is moment of national pride for Wales |accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref>

==== Slate ====
[[Image:Slate detail on Wales Millennium Centre.jpg|thumb|[[Slate]]:<br>Multi-coloured layers of slate]]

The exterior of the building is clad in multi-coloured [[slate]] collected from Welsh slate quarries. Narrow windows are built into the layers of slate to give the impression of rock [[Stratum|strata]] they depict the different stone layers in sea cliffs. The purple slate came from the [[Penrhyn Quarry]], the blue from [[Cwt y Bugail Quarry]], the green from the [[Nantlle Valley]], the grey from [[Llechwedd quarry]], and the black from the [[Braichgoch Slate Mine|Corris Quarry]].<ref name="Design"/>

<blockquote>
<p>
I always loved going to [[Ogmore-by-Sea|Ogmore]] and [[Southerndown]]. I thought the cliffs there looked like a building anyway. A building capable of withstanding the roughest weather for hundreds of years. The older they get, the better they look. I wondered if it would be possible to make a building which had the same qualities as these magnificent cliffs. To do that I needed a lot of stone. Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks; it takes a long time to make and costs a fortune. But in [[north Wales]] the historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that no-one wants. This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two hundred years but which wasn<U+2019>t good enough to make roof slates. Over 90% was thrown away. But it was ideal for making walls like the one I had in mind...<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wmc.org.uk/index.cfm?UUID=149683CE-9891-66AE-205150D73736DC50|publisher= Wales Millennium Centre |title= Stone |accessdate=2009-03-02}}</ref>

==== Metal ====
[[Image:Metal WMC 02.jpg|thumb|Metal:<br>[[Copper oxide]] coated sheet steel]]

The Centre's main feature, the bronze coloured dome, which covers the Donald Gordon Theatre, is clad in steel that was treated with [[Copper(I) oxide|copper oxide]]. It was designed to withstand the weather conditions on the Cardiff Bay waterfront and will look better with age. The architect, Jonathan Adams, decided not to use copper and aluminium as they would both change colour with age and weather conditions.<ref name="Design"/>

<blockquote>
<p>We all know that steel making has been important to [[south Wales]], just as slate making has changed the landscape of the north. We have to use a special type of steel that won<U+2019>t go rusty near to the salt-laden, maritime air of Cardiff Bay. This stainless steel will be made near to [[Pontypool]]. For the Wales Millennium Centre I thought it was important that the materials should have a "natural" texture, and that they should be instantly recognisable to anyone seeing them, even from a distance. For this reason I felt it was important that the steel of the shell should have the rough grain and the riveted pattern that we think of as more typical of old industrial structures, such as those that used to be commonplace around the landscape of the industrial south.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wmc.org.uk/index.cfm?UUID=15263D53-B634-D71B-B78F0C0F2E64AF9D

==== Wood ====
[[File:Inside The Millennium Centre Cardiff.jpg|thumb|[[Wood]]:<br>Used on the balconies in the foyer]]

Both inside and outside the building, including the main [[Donald Gordon]] theatre, the balconies and the rear of the building, is dominated by bands of hardwood lining the walls.<ref name="Design"/>

<blockquote>
<p>Like the exterior of the building, the principal internal spaces are designed to make the best use of natural materials in their natural state. The structure and detail of the concourse galleries echo the form of the exterior, with the curving strata formed in native hardwoods. [[Oak]], [[Ash tree|ash]], [[beech]], [[Acer pseudoplatanus|sycamore]], [[alder]], [[birch]], [[chestnut]] and [[cherry]] woods from renewable sources in [[Mid Wales|mid-Wales]] will be used together in proportions that reflect their relative availability from the forest. The design of the [[concourse]] galleries is intended to evoke the image of the edge of the forest, partly as a counterpoint to the coastal nature of the exterior, and partly because the edge of the forest in folklore and mythology represents a line between the real world and the magical world, a line which resembles the front edge of the theatre stage. The form of trees is created by the interweaving curvature of the gallery edges, and by the random positioning of the supporting columns.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wmc.org.uk/index.cfm?UUID=14A58368-9A8E-3D72-8CAD89BF4D2D456F |publisher= Wales Millennium Centre |title= Wood |accessdate=2009-03-02}}</ref></p>

<p><U+2014>Jonathan Adams</p>
</blockquote>

==== Glass ====
[[Image:WMC Window.jpg|thumb|Glass:<br>Bands of glass from the inside]]

[[Glass]] was used to incorporate into the bands of slate. The glass is {{convert|15|cm|adj=on}} thick and was cut and installed by the Architectural Glass Department at Swansea Institute. Glass is used not in the contemporary British architectural style of the glass curtain.<ref name="Design"/>

Jonathan Adams said, "The glass veins in the external walls of the Wales Millennium Centre make use of conventional glass in a unique way: the sheets of glass are stacked together and fused in a kiln to form solid blocks."<ref name="Glass">{{cite web |url= http://www.wmc.org.uk/index.cfm?UUID=1536CE3B-0C36-72E7-43CCDFD61CF8AA74 |publisher= Wales Millennium Centre |title= Glass |accessdate=2009-03-02}}</ref>

==== Calligraphy ====
Inscribed on the front of the dome, above the main entrance, are two poetic lines, written by Welsh poet [[Gwyneth Lewis]]. The [[Welsh language|Welsh]] version is ''Creu Gwir fel gwydr o ffwrnais [[awen]]'', which means "Creating truth like glass from the furnace of inspiration". The English is ''In These Stones Horizons Sing''. The lettering is formed by windows in the upstairs bar areas and are internally illuminated at night.<ref name="Design"/>
[[Image:Inside the Millennium Centre (2).jpg|thumb|[[Calligraphy]]:<br>The front windows from the inside]]

<blockquote>
<p>The idea of this monumental inscription comes from [[Roman architecture|Roman classical architecture]]. The Romans brought [[Christianity]] to these islands, along with the custom of engraving stone. The form of the [[Celtic cross]] embodies the cross-fertilisation of indigenous and Roman cultures, from which the Welsh nation first emerged. The monumental inscription is a familiar feature of Roman architecture. The inscription over the entrance of the Wales Millennium Centre is a revival of this classical tradition, and also a recognition of the formative influence of Roman culture upon our nation. We<U+2019>re lucky to have two languages; one that we share with half the world and one which belongs just to us. Words in songs, stories and poems have helped to make Wales the proud country that it is.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wmc.org.uk/index.cfm?UUID=154129E7-E320-2A9C-343919F93494A7AE |publisher= Wales Millennium Centre |title= Calligraphy |accessdate=2009-03-02}}</ref></p>

<p><U+2014>Jonathan Adams</p>
</blockquote>

===== Creu Gwir Fel Gwydr O Ffwrnais Awen =====
Of the [[Epigraphy|inscription]], Gwyneth Lewis said:

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted the words to reflect the architecture of the building. Its copper dome reminded me of the [[Furnace#Industrial process furnaces|furnaces]] from Wales's industrial heritage and also Ceridwen's cauldron, from which the early poet Taliesin received his inspiration ('awen'). [[Awen]] suggests both poetic inspiration and the general creative vision by which people and societies form their aspirations.<ref name="Horizons" /></p>

[[Image:In These Stones WMC.jpg|thumb|300px|<center>''Creu Gwir Fel Gwydr O Ffwrnais Awen''<br>and ''In These Stones Horizons Sing'']]

===== In These Stones Horizons Sing =====
Of the inscription, Gwyneth Lewis said: 

<blockquote>
<p>It was important to me that the English words on the building should not simply be a translation of the Welsh, that they should have their own message. The strata of the slate frontage of the Wales Millennium Centre reminded me of the horizons just beyond [[Penarth Head]]. The sea has, traditionally, been for Cardiff the means by which the Welsh export their best to the world and the route by which the world comes to Cardiff. The stones inside the theatre literally sing with opera, musicals and orchestral music, and I wanted to convey the sense of an international space created by the art of music.<ref name="Horizons">{{cite web |url=http://www.gwynethlewis.com/millenniumcentre.shtml |publisher=www.gwynethlewis.com |title=In These Stones Horizons Sing|accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref></p>

"[[In These Stones Horizons Sing]]" is also an [[orchestra]]l work, which was composed by [[Karl Jenkins]], and commissioned by the Wales Millennium Centre for the opening of the Centre on 29 November 2004.

=== Opening weekend celebrations ===
The building was officially opened on the weekend of the 26, 27 and 28 November 2004. The ceremony was organised by [[Bryn Terfel]], the creative director of the whole opening weekend.<ref name="Theatre">{{cite web |url= http://www.theatre-wales.co.uk/news/newsdetail.asp?newsID=1197 |publisher= Theatre in Wales|title= The opening of the Wales Millennium Centre|accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref>   

==== Day 1 &ndash; 26 November 2004 ====
[[File:Wales Millennium Centre plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque to commemorate the opening of the Wales Millennium Centre]]  

The day started with a speech from Lord Rowe-Beddoe, chairman of Wales Millennium Centre, who declared to the crowd that the proceedings were underway.<ref name="Theatre" />  This was followed by a speech from [[Rhodri Morgan]], the [[First Minister for Wales|First Minister]], who stressed that the new arts centre belonged to the whole nation, that it was for all of the people of Wales and not just for the elite.<ref name="Theatre" />

The building was opened by Janet Thickpenny, a young mother from [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]], who was chosen because her on her 40th birthday coincided with that of the opening day.<ref name="Key">{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4046535.stm |publisher= [[BBC News]] |title= Arts lovers' key role in opening |accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref> A human chain delivered the symbolic key, designed and cast by Ann Catrin Evans, to Janet with a fanfare from the National Youth Brass Band of Wales to a [[Karl Jenkins]] specially commissioned work ''[[In These Stones Horizons Sing]]'' and the Centre was open.<ref name="Theatre" />

The evening celebrations began with ''Cymru for the World'', which celebrated the achievements of five leading Welsh artists; [[Gwyneth Jones (soprano)|Gwyneth Jones]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Si<U+00E2>n Phillips]] and the late [[Alun Hoddinott]] and [[Richard Burton]], represented by his daughter [[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]]. This included tributes from [[Robert Hardy]], [[Jonathan Pryce]], [[Derek Jacobi]], [[Nana Mouskouri]], [[Catrin Finch]], [[Ruth Madoc]] and [[Ian McKellen]].<ref name="Theatre" /><ref name="Beginning">{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4047799.stm |publisher= [[BBC News]] |title= Beginning at the beginning |accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref>   

Bryn Terfel started off with a short speech and introduced the Wales Millennium Centre singers and dancers, who in hard hats and donkey jackets sang and danced the story of the construction of the building. They were later joined by all 322 participants in a chorus,<ref name="Theatre" /> including Gwyn Hughes Jones, Bryn Terfel and [[Dennis O'Neill]] sang a duet from [[Les p<U+00EA>cheurs de perles|''Pearl Fishers'']]. [[Diversions the Dance Company of Wales|Diversions]] performed a new ballet based on one of [[Alun Hoddinott]]<U+2019>s works. The Welsh National Opera performed ''[[La Traviata]]'', in their new home. The evening ranged across all musical types from popular to classical.<ref name="Theatre" />

==== Day 2 &ndash; 27 November 2004 ====
The second day was an open door for the public to explore the Centre with a continuous stream of hundreds of people filling through the building from early morning until the fireworks display out in the [[Roald Dahl Plass]].<ref name="Theatre" /> 

==== Day 3 &ndash; 28 November 2004 ====
The final day of the opening weekend began with the arrival of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]], and the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] who met [[First Minister]] [[Rhodri Morgan]] and Lord Rowe-Beddoe, and marked the event by unveiling a plaque.<ref name="Theatre" /> [[Philip Madoc]], Si<U+00E2>n Phillips, [[Gaby Roslin]], [[Michael Ball (singer)|Michael Ball]], [[Charlotte Church]], [[Catrin Finch]] and [[Only Men Aloud!]] were among the artists that entertained the audience during the first act. The second act was opened by the Welsh National Opera and later the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Kirov Ballet]] and [[Cirque <U+00C9>loize]] entertained the audience.<ref name="Theatre" /> Bryn Terfel ended the celebrations.<ref name="Theatre" />

===Design and construction===

The original plans for the Centre were that it would have a concert hall,<ref name="Concert">{{cite web |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article5619811.ece |publisher= [[The Times]]|title= Hoddinott Hall is new patriotic music venue |accessdate=2009-01-31 | location=London}}</ref> however the final design of phase 1 did not include one. Space though had been left for a concert hall to be built in the future when phase 1 of the Centre was opened in 2004, and construction on phase 2 was then due to begin early in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.capitasymonds.co.uk/ournews/article.asp?newsid=805|publisher= [[Capita Symonds]] |title= Official opening of the Wales Millennium Centre|accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref> However, construction of phase 2 did not actually begin until April 2007.<ref name="Keys"/> Phase 2 was designed to fit into the Centre<U+2019>s curved slate frontage, with an upper part constructed from timber.<ref name="Concert"/>

[[File:Hoddinott doors WMC 001.jpg|thumb|left|The entrance to the BBC Hoddinott Hall from within the Wales Millennium Centre]]  

Phase 2 of the Centre was designed by the then newly qualified Tim Green and Keith Vince of Capita Architecture, formerly called Capita Percy Thomas and now part of [[Capita Symonds]], with Arup Acoustics again providing the acoustic design.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.capitasymonds.co.uk/ournews/article.asp?newsid=2529|publisher=[[Capita Symonds]] |title= BBC National Orchestra gets new home |accessdate=2009-01-09}}</ref> The main contractor was again Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd,<ref name="Capita">{{cite web |url= http://www.capitasymonds.co.uk/ournews/article.asp?newsid=1939 |publisher=[[Capita Symonds]] |title= Work underway on WMC's new addition |accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref> with MJN Colston Ltd responsible for the design and installation of all the mechanical, electrical and public health services in the building.<ref name="Colston"/> Other [[subcontractor]]s on the project included [[URS Corp.|URS Corporation]], [[Davis Langdon]] and Hulley & Kirkwood.<ref name="Kirkwood">{{cite web |url=http://www.hulley.co.uk/index.cfm/display_page/hotel_sport_leisure_leisure/control_contentType/case_study_category/display_open/case_study_417|publisher= Hulley & Kirkwood |title= Project Title: C Bay (Recording & Rehearsal Concert Hall)|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref>

Tim Green said of the building that the exterior of the building was designed to be in keeping with the existing Wales Millennium Centre, while the interior had a theme all of its own. "The concept behind the design of the interior of Hoddinott Hall was that of a traditional Welsh chapel."<ref name="Chapel">{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/southeastwales/hi/people_and_places/music/newsid_7837000/7837902.stm |publisher=[[BBC]] |title= In pictures: BBC Hoddinott Hall (picture 5)|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> "The timber treatment at low level is very reminiscent of Victorian chapels and the masonry above.

During the design and construction period, the project name for phase 2 was C Bay.<ref name="Colston">{{cite web |url= http://www.mjncolston.co.uk/projects/view/23 |publisher= MJN Colston |title= C Bay, Cardiff|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref><ref name="Kirkwood"/> Construction of phase 2 began in April 2007,<ref name="Keys">{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7610978.stm|publisher= [[BBC]]|title= Orchestra gets keys to new home |accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> and ended when the keys to the building were handed over at an official ceremony in September 2008,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sir-robert-mcalpine.com/news/?id=6066|publisher= [[Sir Robert McAlpine]] |title= Orchestra's New Home Complete |accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> and the beginning of the fitting out of the BBC Hoddinott Hall by [[BBC Wales]].<ref name="Arup">{{cite web |url= http://www.arup.com/unitedkingdom/newsitem.cfm?pageid=12137|publisher= [[Arup]] |title= New BBC concert hall broadcasts inaugural performance |accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref>

It was part of the Opening Festival which took place between 22 January and 1 February 2009.<ref name="Festival">{{cite web |url= http://www.ccc-acw.org.uk/viewnews.asp?id=997&css=print|publisher= [[Arts Council of Wales]] |title= BBC National Orchestra of Wales Announce Opening at New Venue.|accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref>  The concert was performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and was conducted by [[Thierry Fischer]].

The total cost of phase 1 of the project was GB<U+00A3>106.2 million. The [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] Millennium Fund provided <U+00A3>31.7 million, a further GB<U+00A3>37 million came from The [[National Assembly for Wales]] and <U+00A3>10.4 million was donated by the [[Arts Council of Wales]].<ref name="Design"/> In addition a private investor, South African businessman Donald Gordon donated <U+00A3>20 million to be shared equally between the [[Royal Opera House]] and the Wales Millennium Centre. The Centre also received a <U+00A3>13.5 million loan from HSBC. The remaining funds for the project came from a major sponsorship deal with the [[Principality Building Society]].<ref name="Design"/>  Today the Centre has many corporations and public bodies who provide sponsorship to the Centre.<ref name="Sponsors">{{cite web |url= http://www.wmc.org.uk/index.cfm?UUID=33E2B321-FE01-A618-89F20905EC15B80A  |publisher= Wales Millennium Centre|title=Corporate Support |accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref>

The National Assembly for Wales announced on 6 November 2007 that it was to pay off the outstanding loan of <U+00A3>13.5 million from HSBC and also increase the annual funding. From April 2008, the National Assembly for Wales have given a grant to the Wales Millennium Centre with GB<U+00A3>3.5 million per annum for 3 years.<ref name="Government">{{cite web |url= http://wales.gov.uk/topics/cultureandsport/arts/WMC/?lang=en |publisher= [[Welsh Assembly Government]] |title= Wales Millennium Centre |accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref>  This would only repay the capital debt and not any ongoing operating loss as the Centre remains profitable. The money used to pay the debt came from unallocated funds from the Assembly's previous budget and it was said by the Minister for Heritage, [[Rhodri Glyn Thomas]], that the new money allocation would not come at the expense of other art projects from other parts of Wales.<ref name="Loan">{{cite web |url=http://wales.gov.uk/about/cabinet/cabinetstatements/2007/wmc/?lang=en |publisher=[[Welsh Assembly Government]]|title=The Wales Millennium Centre, Rhodri Glyn Thomas, the Minister for Heritage|accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref>

The cost of phase 2 of the project was approximately <U+00A3>18 million, however the BBC does not own the building, they have leased it for 25 years from the Lime Property Fund, which is a subsidiary of [[Aviva Investors]].<ref name="Cost"/> The building was built by Concert Bay Ltd, which is a subsidiary of Sir Robert McAlpine Enterprises Ltd who co-funded the scheme along with Lime Property Fund.<ref name="Colston"/><ref name="Aviva">{{cite web |url= http://www.aviva.com/index.asp?PageID=55&category=aviva&year=Latest&newsid=3735|publisher= [[Aviva]] |title= UK: Lime Fund acquires Bath University student accommodation |accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> 

In November 2006, Wales Millennium Centre announced that they would begin a two phase rebranding project. The project was won by a local Cardiff company, Sweet. The first phase of the project involved a new corporate logo, the second phase included the complete redesign of other marketing tools, such as brochures and advertisements.<ref name="Sweet">{{cite web |url= http://www.sweetcreative.co.uk/news2.html|publisher= www.sweetcreative.co.uk|title= 01-04-07 Wales Millennium Centre
