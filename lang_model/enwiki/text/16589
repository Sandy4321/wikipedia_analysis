==Career==
===Club career===

Valencia started his career at [[Club Deportivo El Nacional|CD El Nacional]], and earned a transfer to [[Spain|Spanish]], [[La Liga]] club [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] in 2005 after his fine debut for his [[Ecuador national football team|national side]] against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]]. However, he was loaned to [[Recreativo de Huelva]] as he attempted to adjust to European football,  helping them climb [[La Liga]] during the 2005&ndash;06 season.

On [[1 August]] [[2006]] it was reported in the British Press that Valencia could be coming to the [[Premier League]], and suggested [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]<ref name="Sunday's gossip column (July 23, 2006)">{{cite news

Wigan manager [[Paul Jewell]] had this to say about his new signing: "Antonio is something new for Wigan. As with most South Americans, he has skill in abundance and combines it with electric pace and a very high work rate. He has played in Europe for a season, and I'm convinced he has the attributes to make a success of the Premiership. He is something different and I feel he is going to bring an exciting new dimension to our squad."<ref name="Wigan snap up Ecuador's Valencia">{{cite news | title = Wigan snap up Ecuador's Valencia| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wigan_athletic/5243610.stm | publisher = BBC Sport| date = [[2006-08-03]] | accessdate = 2007-04-01}}</ref> 

On [[19 August]] [[2006]] Valencia made his debut for Wigan, starting on the right wing in a 2&ndash;1 loss to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. On [[21 October]] [[2006]] Valencia scored his first goal for Wigan, scoring against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] to seal a 4&ndash;0 victory. 

In summer of [[2007]] new Wigan manager [[Chris Hutchings]] announced that Valencia had been signed on for another year. On [[18 January]] [[2008]] he joined permanently for an undisclosed fee, signing a three and a half year contract.<ref>{{cite news

Valencia's excellent form for his club lead him to be linked with a move to English giants [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Liverpool F.C.]] in summer 2008.<ref>{{cite news | title= Ferguson knows top four targets | url= http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/article1050423.ece | publisher=[[The Sun]] | date= [[2008-04-17]] | accessdate= 2008-04-17}}</ref>

===International career===
Valencia's first international cap was in a qualifier against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]]. [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] won 5&ndash;2, with Valencia scoring 2 goals. He started in Ecuador's warm-up friendlies and played in Ecuador's World Cup campaign, which included wins against [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]], where Valencia provided a cross leading to [[Carlos Tenorio]]'s 8th minute goal.
 
As a reward to his fine display, Valencia was chosen as a nominee for FIFA's ideal 11 team, which recognises the top stars for every position in the [[World Cup]]. He was also shortlisted as one of the six potential candidates for the [[FIFA World Cup awards|Gillette Best Young Player]] award.<ref>{{cite news | title= Six Gillette Best Young Player nominees chosen | url= http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/news/newsid=24742.html#six+gillette+best+young+player+nominees+chosen | date= [[2006-07-04]] | accessdate= 2008-03-21}}</ref> A point of controversy has been that in the opening stages of the knockout rounds of [[2006 FIFA World Cup|Germany 06]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]] winger [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] led the poll in votes, but soon after the [[England national football team|England]] vs [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] quarterfinal match which Portugal won, Valencia began to dominate the poll standings. This is largely due to a email campaign by the English to vote for Valencia, who quickly surpassed Ronaldo in terms of votes.<ref>{{cite news | title=Supporters 'hijack' Ronaldo vote | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/5153870.stm | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | date=[[2006-07-06]] | accessdate=2008-04-25}}</ref> Although it was [[Lukas Podolski]] who was selected for the award, Valencia received the most votes in the official poll. Despite this incident, this sealed Valencia's status as a rising star for both club and country.

On [[27 June]] [[2007]] he scored against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] during [[Copa America 2007]].
