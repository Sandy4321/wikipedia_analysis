The '''Como Railway Bridge''' carries the [[Illawarra railway line]] across the [[Georges River]] between the [[Sydney]] suburbs of [[Oatley, New South Wales|Oatley]] and [[Como, New South Wales|Como]].

==First bridge==
The original Como Railway Bridge opened on 26 December 1885 as part of the extension of the [[Illawarra railway line]] from [[Hurstville railway station|Hurstville]] to [[Sutherland railway station|Sutherland]]. It was a single track [[lattice truss bridge]] designed by [[John Whitton]], the Chief Engineer of the [[New South Wales Government Railways]]. The double tracks converged to a single [[gauntlet track]] on the bridge, which enabled trains to cross in either direction without [[Railroad switch|points]]. When the rest of the line was duplicated, it became a major bottleneck.<ref name=NSWEnvironment&Heritage>[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4801834 Meadowbank (Georges River) Underbridge] NSW Environment & Heritage</ref><ref name=SydneyWater>[http://www.sydneywater.com.au/SW/water-the-environment/what-we-re-doing/Heritage-search/heritage-detail/index.htm?heritageid=4576032&FromPage=searchresults Como Railway Bridge] Sydney Water</ref>

Between 1935 and 1942, the [[Sydney Water|Metropolitan Water Sewerage & Drainage Board]] built two 60 centimetre diameter pipelines to pump water from the recently completed [[Woronora Dam]] to the reservoir at [[Penshurst, New South Wales|Penshurst]]. The pipeline was supported on new steel outriggers cantilevered from the main girders.<ref name=SydneyWater/>

==Second bridge==
To relieve the bottleneck, a new double track reinforced concrete bridge immediately to the west opened on 27 November 1972. The original bridge reopened as a cycleway on 15 December 1985.<ref name=NSWEnvironment&Heritage/><ref name=SydneyWater/><ref>[http://off.oatleypark.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oatley-como-walkway.pdf Establishing the Oatley-Como Bikeway/Walkway] Oatley Flora & Fauna Conservation Society</ref>
