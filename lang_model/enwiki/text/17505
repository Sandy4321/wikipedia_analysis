'''7796 J<U+00E1>racimrman''' {{IPA|['ja:ra<U+02A6><U+026A>mr<U+0329>man]}} (sometimes spelt as Jaracimrman) is an [[asteroid]] orbiting in the [[asteroid belt|main belt]] of asteroids between [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. It belongs among the IIa family of asteroids. It cannot approach the [[Earth]] nearer than 197 million [[Kilometre|km]].

== The discovery ==
The asteroid was discovered on the [[Kle<U+0165> Observatory]] ([[Czech Republic]]) on [[16 January]] [[1996]] by [[Zden<U+011B>k Moravec]] and was designated 1996 BG. It was observed until April 1996 and then in June and July 1997. It was discovered to be a lost asteroid which had previously been observed twice: at the [[Brera Astronomical Observatory|Brera-Merate Observatory]] in northern [[Italy]] on [[12 December]] [[1973]] and at [[Mount Stromlo Observatory]] (near [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]) on [[8 July|8]] and [[9 July]] [[1990]].

In [[1997]] its [[orbit]] was determined more precisely by a number of other observatories and thus it could be numbered as asteroid 7796. It became the 312th numbered asteroid discovered at the Kle<U+0165> Observatory, and Moravec suggested to name it after the fictional Czech genius [[J<U+00E1>ra Cimrman]].

The citation accompanying the suggestion said: "Named for J<U+00E1>ra Cimrman, a fictitious Czech genius. An analogue to [[Leonardo da Vinci]], he was a playwright, composer, poet, painter, versatile scientist, inventor, polar explorer, sportsman, first man on the moon, etc. Although his name is not mentioned in any encyclopedia, his work is explored at the J<U+00E1>ra Cimrman Theatre in [[Prague]]. This theatre is headed by the famous cimrmanologists [[Zden<U+011B>k Sv<U+011B>r<U+00E1>k|Z. Sv<U+011B>r<U+00E1>k]] and [[Ladislav Smoljak|L. Smoljak]], who endorsed the name proposal." [http://www.klet.org/names/view.php3?astnum=7796]

The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] Committee on Small Body Nomenclature approved this name in [[1998]].

== Physical characteristics ==
On the basis of its [[absolute magnitude]] in the visible [[light spectrum]] and [[albedo]] the [[diameter]] of the asteroid 7796 J<U+00E1>racimrman can be estimated 12.54 km. Since astronomers do not have the spectral data on the asteroid, neither its chemical nor mineralogical composition is known.
