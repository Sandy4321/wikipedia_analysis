'''''And the Mountains Echoed''''' is the third [[novel]] by Afghan-American author [[Khaled Hosseini]]. Published in 2013 by [[Riverhead Books]], it deviates from Hosseini's style in his first two works through his choice to avoid focusing on any one character. Rather, the book is written similarly to a collection of short stories, with each of the nine chapters being told from the perspective of a different character. The book's foundation is built on the relationship between ten-year-old Abdullah and his three-year-old sister Pari and their father's decision to sell her to a childless couple in Kabul, an event that ties the various narratives together.

Hosseini stated his intentions to make the characters more complex and morally ambiguous. Continuing the familial theme established in his previous novels, ''[[The Kite Runner]]'' and ''[[A Thousand Splendid Suns]]'', ''And the Mountains Echoed'' centers on the rapport between siblings. Besides Abdullah and Pari, Hosseini introduced two other sibling and sibling-like relationships<U+2014>the children's stepmother Parwana and her disabled sister Masooma and an Afghan-American doctor named Idris and his cousin Timur.

As it was Hosseini's first novel to be published in six years, ''And the Mountains Echoed'' was reportedly in high demand.<ref name="Medley">{{cite news|last=Medley|first=Mark|title=Relative unease: Khaled Hosseini discusses And The Mountains Echoed|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2013/05/29/khaled-hosseini/|work=[[National Post]]|date=May 13, 2013|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref> It received favorable pre-publication reviews and was anticipated as another strong success, reaching the top 10 on [[Amazon.com]] before its release<ref name="Italie">{{cite news|last=Italie|first=Hillel|title=Khaled Hosseini on his new novel "And the Mountains Echoed"|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_23356303/khaled-hosseini-his-new-novel-and-mountains-echoed|work=[[Denver Post]]|date=June 2, 2013|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref> and later becoming a bestseller.<ref>{{cite news|title='And the Mountains Echoed' is a local best-seller|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/books/2021322949_localbestsell07xml.html|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=July 7, 2013|accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref> Five months after the publication of ''And the Mountains Echoed'', it was reported that three million copies had been sold.<ref name="Dawn">{{cite news|title=Khaled Hosseini condemns Western 'fortress mentality'|url=http://dawn.com/news/1050351/khaled-hosseini-condemns-western-fortress-mentality|publisher=[[Dawn.com]]|date=October 19, 2013|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref>

== Composition and publication ==
[[File:George and Laura Bush with Khaled Hosseini in 2007 detail2.JPG|left|thumb|upright|[[Khaled Hosseini]], 2007]]
Khaled Hosseini was born in Afghanistan but left the country in 1976 at the age of 11, eventually moving to the United States where he worked as a doctor. He wrote his first novel, ''[[The Kite Runner]]'', in 2003 and became a full-time writer a year and a half later. He published his second book, ''[[A Thousand Splendid Suns]]'', in 2007. Both novels were successful, and by the time of his third publication they had together sold over 38 million copies across 70 countries.<ref name="Jain">{{cite news|last=Jain|first=Saudamini|title=Khaled Hosseini and his new book And The Mountains Echoed|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Brunch/Brunch-Stories/Khaled-Hosseini-and-his-new-book-And-The-Mountains-Echoed/Article1-1066161.aspx|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=May 26, 2013|accessdate=August 25, 2013}}</ref>

Hosseini first began to consider the plot of ''And the Mountains Echoed'' during a 2007 trip to Afghanistan with the [[UN Refugee Agency]]. While there, he heard stories from several village elders about the deaths of young, impoverished children during the winters, which gave the foundation for the fundamental event of the novel: a parent's choice to sell a child to prevent this from occurring.<ref name="Jain"/> "The novel began very, very small, and it began with a single image in my head that I simply could not shed," he relayed. "It was the image of a man walking across the desert and he's pulling a little Radio Flyer red wagon, and in it there's a little girl about 3 years old, and there's a boy walking behind him, and these three people are walking across the desert."<ref name="NPR">{{cite news|title=Siblings' Separation Haunts In 'Kite Runner' Author's Latest|url=http://www.npr.org/2013/05/19/184191561/siblings-separation-haunts-in-kite-runner-authors-latest|work=[[NPR]]|date=May 19, 2013|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref> Hosseini originally planned for it to be written in a linear fashion similar to his previous novels, but, during the writing process, it was expanded to cover a series of interconnected stories surrounding a large number of characters not directly related to each other. Comparing the process to a tree, he stated that story "just branched out" and "got bigger and bigger as it went along".<ref name="Merschel">{{cite news|last=Merschel|first=Michael|title=Khaled Hosseini struggled with 'And the Mountains Echoed'|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/books/20130607-khaled-hosseini-struggled-with-and-the-mountains-echoed.ece|work=[[Dallas News]]|date=June 7, 2013|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref>

The novel begins, then, with this single act of desperation, of sacrifice, an act that ruptures the family and ultimately becomes the tree trunk from which the novel's many branches spread out."

As is his pattern, Hosseini drew on his early experiences in Afghanistan to create the foundation of the book.<ref name="Merschel"/> He states that his travels to Afghanistan later in life also influenced his writing, albeit involuntarily. For example, during a 2009 visit he met two young sisters in a remote village outside Kabul. The older one, who he estimated to be around six years old, acted as a mother figure to the younger girl. Hosseini stated that their bond formed the foundation of the relationship between Abdullah and Pari in the novel.<ref name="Wrenn">{{cite news|last=Martin Wrenn|first=Jill|title=Khaled Hosseini on parenthood and political asylum|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/24/living/hosseini-mountains-echoed-refugee|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=June 24, 2013|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref>

''And the Mountains Echoed'' became the first to not deal directly with the Taliban, which featured prominently in both of his previous works. Though Hosseini did not consciously decide to avoid that topic, he stated that he was glad that he had moved away from it in order to keep the storyline fresh.<ref name="Jain"/> The characters' struggles were largely personal and unrelated to the political turmoil in Afghanistan. Hosseini added, "I hope a day will come when we write about Afghanistan, where we can speak about Afghanistan in a context outside of the wars and the struggles of the last 30 years. In some way I think this book is an attempt to do that."<ref name="NPR"/>

== Plot ==
The novel opens in the year 1952. Saboor, an impoverished farmer from the fictional village of Shadbagh, decides to sell his three-year-old daughter Pari to a wealthy, childless couple in Kabul. The choice devastates his ten-year-old son, Abdullah, who raised Pari following their mother's death in childbirth.

Subsequent chapters expound on how the arrangement came to be: the children's stepmother, Parwana, grew up as the less-favored child to her beautiful twin sister Masooma. One day, in a flash of jealously, she caused Masooma to suffer a debilitating injury that resulted in [[paraplegia]]. Parwana subsequently spent several years caring for her sister until the latter asked her to help her commit suicide and to then marry Saboor. Their older brother, Nabi, left to work for Mr. Wahdati, a wealthy man in Kabul, and became infatuated with his wife, Nila. After Nila expressed dismay about her inability to have children, Nabi arranged for Pari to be sold to the couple.

In the ensuing years, Abdullah leaves Afghanistan and Mr. Wahdati suffers a stroke, prompting Nila to take Pari and move to Paris, France. Nabi, while assuming the role of Wahdati's primary caregiver, finds a number of sketchbooks in Wahdati's closet filled with pictures of him drawn before the stroke. Unnerved by the discovery of his employer's apparent obsession with him, he resolves to leave but decides against it after he is unable to find someone suitable to take over for him. Nabi subsequently spends the next 50 years working for Mr. Wahdati before ultimately assisting in the latter's suicide.

Wahdati's neighbors, meanwhile, move to the United States with their children after the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Soviet invasion]]. Cousins Idris and Timur return to Afghanistan over two decades later in 2003 to reclaim their family's property. While there, Timur makes a great show of publicly distributing money to street beggars while Idris privately bonds with Roshi, an Afghan girl who suffers from a horrific injury and whose family was murdered by her uncle. Idris at first promises to arrange for Roshi to undergo the operations needed for her recovery but distances himself from her and Afghanistan on returning to the States. Several years later, Idris comes across Roshi signing copies of her bestselling memoir, which she has dedicated to her adoptive mother and Timur, who paid for her surgery.

Nila, now living in Paris, is unhappy for much of her life, taking up a number of lovers and beginning to refer to the plain and practical Pari as her "punishment". She commits suicide in 1974 after giving a detailed interview about her early life. Pari suspects that she is not Nila's biological daughter and plans a trip to Afghanistan to explore her heritage. However, she postpones it indefinitely after marrying and becoming pregnant. After having three children and being widowed at the age of 48, she receives a posthumous letter from Nabi in 2010 detailing the circumstances of her adoption by the Wahdatis.

Later chapters focus on Adel, a boy learning that his father is a war criminal and that his house is built on the land that previously belonged to Saboor, and Markos, a Greek aid worker in Afghanistan and acquaintance of Nabi. In the final chapter, narrated by Abdullah's daughter, Abdullah and Pari are reunited in California. However, he is suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]] and is unable to remember her.

Khaled Hosseini chose to tell the story in a "fragmented and fluid" form;<ref name="Smith"/> each of the nine chapters is told from a different character's perspective, and each narrative provides an interconnection with the others'. ''Los Angeles Times'' critic Wendy Smith compared this style to the classic ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.<ref name="Smith"/>

*'''Abdullah''' is an Afghan growing up in the fictional village of Shadbagh. After his father's choice to sell his younger sister to a couple in Kabul, he resolves to leave Afghanistan, travelling to Pakistan and eventually the United States. He opens an Afghan restaurant there and has a daughter, whom he names after his sister. Following his wife's death, Abdullah is diagnosed with Alzheimer's and is later unable to remember his sister after being reunited with her.

*'''Pari''' is Abdullah's younger sister who, at the age of three, is sold by her father to the wealthy Wahdati couple in Kabul. She and Abdullah are portrayed as having an unusually close relationship during her early years, though she forgets him along with the rest of her biological family following her adoption. She spends her adolescence and adulthood in France following her adoptive father's stroke and eventually becomes aware of her history through a posthumous letter from her uncle Nabi, who had arranged for her to be sold as a child. When she is finally reunited with Abdullah, he is unable to remember her due to his Alzheimer's. "I could see that if the reunion were to occur, it would occur on these terms and it wouldn't be the reunion we'd expect and perhaps the one we want," Hosseini explained.<ref name="Hoby"/>

*'''Nila Wahdati''' is a young Afghan woman renowned for her sexually charged poetry who is married off to a wealthy Kabul businessman. According to Hosseini, many aspects of her character were derived from women he encountered during parties his parents hosted in Kabul in the 1970s, many of whom he recalls as "beautiful, very outspoken, temperamental...drinking freely, smoking".<ref name="Hoby"/> At some point prior to the beginning of the story, she was apparently sterilized while undergoing treatment for an illness, leading her to buy Pari as an adopted daughter. Described as unusually beautiful and discontent, she later relocates to Paris following her husband's stroke and eventually commits suicide. Hosseini explained that he was unconcerned with making Nila likable<U+2014>"I just wanted her to be real <U+2013> full of anger and ambition and insight and frailty and narcissism."<ref name="Hoby"/>

*'''Parwana''' is the stepmother of Abdullah and Pari. She grew up in Shadbagh with her brother, Nabi, and twin sister, Masooma. Parwana is ill-favored for most of her life as opposed to the strikingly beautiful Masooma. This eventually results in what Rafia Zakaria describes as a "poignant tale of a plain twin whose single act of vengeance, of pushing her pretty sister off a swing results in a lifelong moral burden".<ref name="Zakaria"/> Masooma's accident leaves her paralyzed, leaving Parwana tortured by guilt and forced to care for her from then on.<ref name="Zakaria"/> After several years, Masooma persuades Parwana to leave her in the desert to die and marry Saboor, Abdullah and Pari's father.

*'''Nabi''' is the older brother of Parwana and Masooma. Despite being "a character who slips beneath the notice of many of the novel's noisier characters",<ref name="Brown"/> he organizes the event that serves as the primary plot of the story: the adoption of Pari.

*'''Amra Ademovic''' is a [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] nurse working in a hospital in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban. She cares for and later adopts Roshi, a critically wounded Afghan orphan. Amra, according to Hosseini, was created to represent the foreign aid workers serving in Afghanistan. While visiting the country in 2003, he had encountered a number of people who had left comfortable lifestyles to help provide relief aid, and he had wanted to pay tribute to them through the portrayal of Amra.<ref name="Pera">{{cite news|last=Pera|first=Mariam|title=Khaled Hosseini Discusses Unforeseen Consequences|url=http://www.americanlibrariesmagazine.org/blog/khaled-hosseini-discusses-unforeseen-consequences|work=American Libraries Magazine|date=July 3, 2013|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref> Hosseini described the character as one of his favorites<ref name="Pera"/> and said, "She has seen humanity at its worst, having worked in war zones most of her career, and yet she has retained great capacity for compassion and mercy.

*'''Idris''' is an Afghan-American doctor who left Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion. He later returns to Afghanistan, along with his narcissistic and childish cousin Timur, in 2003 to reclaim their family's land. While there, Idris meets Roshi and befriends her, moved by her tragic story. Hosseini stated that Idris' experience as an Afghan expatriate was partly based on his own. "He was a vehicle to describe what it's like to be an Afghan in exile, to return to see how divergent my experience was from other Afghans," Hosseini said.<ref name="Pera"/> Idris begins to set up plans to pay for her surgery in America, but upon returning home, he loses that drive. It is later revealed Timur pays for Roshi's surgery.

His childhood best friend, Thalia, suffered from severe facial disfigurement after being [[Dog attack|attacked by a dog]] and undergoing a botched surgery. This motivated Markos to become a surgeon and work in various developing countries, including Afghanistan.

*'''Adel''' is the son of a wealthy war criminal who has turned Shadbagh into "Shadbagh-e-Nau" or "New Shadbagh". Adel is raised is an isolated mansion with the belief that his father is a hero, witnessing him donate money and fund the building of schools.

Khaled Hosseini considers loss, memory, and familial love to be the primary themes of ''And the Mountains Echoed''. The separation of the two siblings, Abdullah and Pari, is "the heart of the book".<ref name="NPR"/> Both subsequently become "victims of the passage of time": Abdullah, who is older and remembers Pari, agonizes over her loss for most of his life, while Pari is younger and able to forget her brother after losing him. However, by the end of the book, Pari remembers Abdullah and locates him in the United States only to discover that he is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and has forgotten her. Hosseini stated, "The question is raised a number of times about whether memory is a blessing <U+2014> something that safeguards in all the things that are dear to you <U+2014> or is memory a curse <U+2014> something that makes you relive the most painful parts of your life, the toil, the struggle, the sorrows."<ref name="NPR"/> Thus, the combination of these events make ''And the Mountains Echoed'' "kind of like a fairytale turned on its head".<ref name="Hoby">{{cite news|last=Hoby|first=Hermione|title=Khaled Hosseini: 'If I could go back now, I'd take The Kite Runner apart'|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/01/khaled-hosseini-kite-runner-interview|work=The Guardian|date=May 31, 2013|accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref>

Rafia Zakaria, a director for [[Amnesty International USA]], wrote that the themes of guilt, gratitude, and dependence also feature prominently. She used the backstory of Parwana, Abdullah and Pari's stepmother, and her sister Masooma as an example: "We find a poignant tale of a plain twin whose single act of vengeance, of pushing her pretty sister off a swing results in a lifelong moral burden.

Alexander Linklater from ''The Guardian'' wrote, "From the moment the realisation dawns that Saboor is going to give Pari to the wife of a wealthy man in Kabul, Hosseini saturates the various layers and characters of his novel with a yearning for the moment that brother and sister will reunite."<ref>{{cite news|last=Linklater|first=Alexander|title=And the Mountains Echoed by Khaled Hosseini <U+2013> review|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/26/mountains-echoed-khaled-hosseini-review|work=The Guardian|date=May 25, 2013|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}</ref> Soniah Kamal of ''Atlanta Arts'' was particularly favorable towards Amra, the Bosnian aid worker who cares for and adopts Roshi, as she "stuns with her hope in humanity no matter what callousness she has witnessed".<ref name="Kamal"/> ''[[USA Today]]'' critic Kevin Nance found the story of Abdullah and Pari "devastating" but thought the large cast of characters, "including some introduced fairly late in the proceedings, when the reader just wants to return to the core cast", was excessive.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nance|first=Kevin|title=And the Mountains Echoed|url=http://books.usatoday.com/book/hosseini-peaks-again-with-wide-ranging-%E2%80%98mountains/r851515|work=USA Today|date=May 21, 2013|accessdate=September 4, 2013}}</ref>

The structure of the book drew mixed reactions, with ''[[Toronto Star]]'s'' Kim Hughs describing it as "the novel's most defining feature and its most exasperating conceit". She believed that Pari was meant to be the protagonist of the story but that the shifting focus on the numerous other personalities left her "barely [squeaking] through the clutter".<ref>{{cite news|first=Kim|last=Hughes|title=And the Mountains Echoed by Khaled Hosseini: Review|url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/books/2013/05/16/and_the_mountains_echoed_by_khaled_hosseini_review.html|work=The Star|date=May 16, 2013|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}</ref> ''The Independent's'' Arifa Akbar stated, "The changing points of view and leaps in time can confuse and confine, leaving characters clearly defined but lacking depth. Decades gallop by and it is as if the story of these interconnected, cross -enerational lives will simply go on echoing the original crime of Abdullah and Pari's separation."<ref>{{cite news|first=Arifa|last=Akbar|title=And the Mountains Echoed, By Khaled Hosseini; A Fort of Nine Towers, By Qais Akbar Omar|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/and-the-mountains-echoed-by-khaled-hosseinia-fort-of-nine-towers-by-qais-akbar-omar-8637927.html|work=[[The Independent newspaper|The Independent]]|date=May 31, 2013|accessdate=August 25, 2013}}</ref> [[Michiko Kakutani]] from ''[[The New York Times]]'' thought the novella-like storytelling was handled well and wrote, "Khaled Hosseini's new novel, ''And the Mountains Echoed,'' may have the most awkward title in his body of work, but it's his most assured and emotionally gripping story yet, more fluent and ambitious than ''The Kite Runner'' (2003), more narratively complex than ''A Thousand Splendid Suns'' (2007)."<ref name="Kakutani">{{cite news|first=Michiko|last=Kakutani|title=Siblings Haunted by the Past, and by Afghanistan's Cycle of Misery|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/books/and-the-mountains-echoed-by-khaled-hosseini.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 20, 2013|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}</ref> Kamal agreed, saying that the structure was "exquisitely crafted".<ref name="Kamal">{{cite news|first=Soniah|last=Kamal|title=Review: Khaled Hosseini finds light amid darkness in masterful "And the Mountains Echoed"|url=http://www.artsatl.com/2013/06/review-khaled-hosseinis-knockout-and-mountains-echoed-explores-personal-accountability-choices-determine-lives/|work=Atlanta Arts|date=June 5, 2013|accessdate=August 25, 2013}}</ref> ''Scoop Empire'''s Sherine El Banhawy added that the focus on multiple characters allowed to readers to gain a better understanding of the diversities of Afghan culture.<ref>{{cite news|first=Sherine|last=El Banhawy|title=And the Mountains Echoed|url=http://www.scoopempire.com/post/2013/06/20/Review-And-the-Mountains-Echoed.aspx|work=Scoop Empire|date=June 20, 2013|accessdate=August 25, 2013}}</ref>
