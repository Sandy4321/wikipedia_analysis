A '''Parry arc''' is a rare [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]], an [[optical phenomenon]] which occasionally appears over a [[22<U+00B0> halo]] together with a [[upper tangent arc]].

== Discovery ==
The halo was first described by Sir [[William Edward Parry]] (1790-1855) in 1820 during one of his Arctic expeditions in search for the [[Northwest Passage]].  On April 8, under harsh conditions while his two ships were trapped by ice forcing him to winter over at [[Melville Island, Canada|Melville Island]] in the northern [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]], he made a drawing of the phenomenon.  The drawing accurately renders the [[parhelic circle]], a [[22<U+00B0> halo]], a pair of [[sun dog]]s, a [[lower tangent arc]], a [[46<U+00B0> halo]], and a [[circumzenithal arc]].  He did, however, get the [[upper tangent arc]] slightly wrong.  On the other hand, he added two arcs extending laterally from the bases of the 46<U+00B0> halo, for long interpreted as incorrectly drawn [[infralateral arc]]s, but, as thing were, probably correctly drawn [[subhelic arc]]s. (both produced by the same crystal orientation but with light passing through different faces of the crystals.)<ref name="atoptics-Parry-1820">Cowley, ''Parry 1820''</ref>

== Formation ==
Parry arcs are generated by double-oriented [[hexagon]]al [[column crystal]]s, i.e. a so called '''Parry orientation''', where both the central main axis of the prism and the top and bottom prism side faces are oriented horizontally.  This orientation is responsible for several rare haloes.  Parry arcs are the result of light passing through two side faces forming a 60<U+00B0> angle.  The shape of Parry arcs changes with the elevation of the sun and are subsequently called upper or lower arcs to indicate they are found above or under the sun, and sunvex or suncave depending on their orientation.<ref name="atoptics-parry-arc">Cowley, ''Parry Arcs''</ref><ref name="meteoros-parry">Arbeitskreis Meteore, ''Parry Arc''</ref>  Parry arcs can be confused with either [[upper tangent arc]]s, [[Lowitz arc]]s, and any of the odd radius halos produced by [[pyramidal crystal]]s.
