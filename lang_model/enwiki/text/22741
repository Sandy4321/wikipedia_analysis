This is a '''discography for the Smoking Popes''', a [[pop punk]] band from [[Lake in the Hills, Illinois]]. The [[Smoking Popes]] have released four [[studio albums]], a [[compilation album]], two [[live albums]], four [[extended play]]s (EPs), and seven [[single (music)|singles]]. The group was founded in 1991 by [[Mike Felumlee]] ([[drum]]s) and brothers Matt ([[bass guitar]]), Eli ([[guitar]]), and [[Josh Caterer]] (guitar, vocals). After releasing three independent EPs, the Popes signed with local [[punk rock]] [[record label]] [[Johann's Face Records]]. Johann's Face issued a fourth EP and the Popes' first two studio albums<U+2014>''[[Get Fired]]'' and ''[[Born to Quit]]''.

[[EMI]] subsidiary [[Capitol Records]] signed the band and re-released ''Born to Quit'' in 1995, yielding a minor hit on punk rock radio stations with "Need You Around".<ref name="Kot">{{citenews|last=Kot|first=Greg|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thesmokingpopes/albums/album/239881/review/5943882/born_to_quit|title=The Smoking Popes: Born to Quit (review)|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|date=1995-08-24|accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref> The Smoking Popes released their third album through Capitol in 1997 and broke up the following year. To fulfill their contract with Capitol Records, the band recorded an album of cover songs, which was rejected for release by the label.<ref name="party">{{cite web|last=DiGravina|first=Greg|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:hvfrxqe0ldfe|title=The Party's Over (review)|publisher=[[All Music Guide]]|accessdate=2008-05-10}}</ref> The Popes were dormant until they reunited in late 2005. The band played a reunion show on [[November 11]], [[2005]], recording and releasing the concert through Felumlee's [[Double Zero Records]]. They are currently working on a fourth studio album for [[Flameshovel Records]].<ref name="New">{{citeweb|last=Murphy|first=Hayley|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/49134-smoking-popes-idowni-with-flameshovel-for-new-lp|title=Smoking Popes Down With Flameshovel for New LP|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=2008-03-05|accessdate=2008-05-10}}</ref>
