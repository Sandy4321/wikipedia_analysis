'''State Route 161''' (SR-161) is a {{convert|3.084|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[state highway]], designated as a rural major connector, completely within [[Millard County, Utah|Millard County]] in central [[Utah]]. The highway connects [[I-70 (UT)|Interstate 70]] (I-70) to [[I-15 (UT)|I-15]] while providing service to historic [[Cove Fort, Utah|Cove Fort]]. The route was once part of [[U.S. Route 91]] (US-91), but was renumbered to SR-161 in the 1970s, in parallel with the construction of I-70.

==Route description==
Located entirely in southeastern [[Millard County, Utah|Millard County]],<ref name="millard map">{{cite map |publisher=Utah Department of Transportation |title=General Highway Map&nbsp;<U+2014> Millard County |url=http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/f?p=100:pg:295315469568359600::::V,T:,364 |year=2005 |page=6 |accessdate=2008-09-30}}</ref> SR-161 starts at a [[diamond interchange]] with the westernmost exit on [[Interstate 70 in Utah|I-70]] before it terminates at [[Interstate 15 in Utah|I-15]]. The road continues northward until it reaches the historic [[Cove Fort]] and the associated visitors center. On the eastern side of the highway is a [[Utah Department of Transportation]] (UDOT) maintenance center. SR-161 starts to make a gentle turn to the northeast, passing a [[filling station]], which also serves as a [[rest area]] as part of a [[public<U+2013>private partnership]] between UDOT and the owners of the station.<ref name="reference-161" /> The highway intersects I-15 and comes to an end at a [[cattle grid|cattle guard]] on Black Rock Road northwest of the interchange with I-15.<ref name="gmaps">{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&saddr=38.615772,-112.612106&daddr=UT-161&hl=en&geocode=%3BFXXITAIdqRhK-Q&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=0&sz=18&sll=38.61589,-112.612267&sspn=0.001622,0.003964&ie=UTF8&ll=38.602249,-112.600765&spn=0.051917,0.175781&t=h&z=13 |title=SR-161 Overview |accessdate=2008-09-30}}</ref>

In 2007, a [[AADT|daily average]] of 455 cars traveled along SR-161, representing only a slight growth from previous years; in 2006, the average was 450 and in 2005, 415).<ref name="AADT 2007-Car">{{cite web|url=http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/uconowner.gf?n=2363711025498494585|format=PDF|title=Traffic on Utah Highways - 2007|date=2008-07-02|publisher=Utah Department of Transportation|pages=|accessdate=2008-09-30}}</ref> Thirty five percent of this traffic was composed of trucks.<ref name="AADT 2007-Truck">{{cite web|url=http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/uconowner.gf?n=2363733707060508179|format=PDF|title=Truck Traffic on Utah Highways - 2007|date=2008-07-02|publisher=Utah Department of Transportation|pages=|accessdate=2008-09-30}}</ref> The average traffic measurement is collected at a point on SR-161 between Cove Fort and the interchange with I-15.

==History==
The SR-161 designation has been used two other times for other state routes. The first route, which was formed in 1933, connected US-50/US-89/US-91 (now [[US-89 (UT)|US-89]]) to [[Utah State Route 68|SR-68]] in [[Bluffdale, Utah|Bluffdale]] until the route was decommissioned in 1953. From May 8, 1961 to February 14, 1964, the route number was [[Utah State Route 161 (1961-1964)|used for a road]] from US-91 to [[Interstate 15 in Utah|I-15]] in the city of [[Beaver, Utah|Beaver]].<ref name="resolutions-161" />

The parallel [[T-beam]] bridges that carry I-15 over SR-161 at its northern terminus were constructed in 1966 along with the construction of I-15 though the area.<ref name="nbi-15">{{cite web|url=http://nationalbridges.com|title=++++++++0D+745 |year=2009|work=National Bridge Inventory|publisher=[[United States Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> The bridges carrying I-70 over SR-161 were constructed in 1973.<ref name="nbi-70a">{{cite web|url=http://nationalbridges.com|title=++++++++2F+193 |year=2009|work=National Bridge Inventory|publisher=United States Department of Transportation|accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref><ref name="nbi-70b">{{cite web|url=http://nationalbridges.com|title=++++++++4F+193 |year=2009|work=National Bridge Inventory|publisher=United States Department of Transportation|accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref>

The current route, codified into Utah law in 1965 and designated on signage following the decommissioning of US-91 in the 1970s, was partially a former alignment of US-91. Once I-70 was completed the {{convert|1.07|mi|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} long segment of US-91 as well as the roadway to the north was designated SR-161 by the Utah State Department of Highways. No significant changes have been made to the roadway except for its legal definition.<ref name="resolutions-161">{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.utah.gov/main/uconowner.gf?n=200609190933291|title=Route 161|date=November 2007|work=[http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/f?p=100:pg:3977778294530221:::1:T,V:1348 Highway Resolutions]|publisher=Utah Department of Transportation|accessdate=2008-09-30|format=PDF}}</ref> SR-161 serves the important function of providing access to the contracted rest area as well as the historic Cove Fort. Currently no new projects are scheduled for SR-161, either through the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] or the UDOT Statewide Transportation Improvement Program.<ref name="udot-stip">{{cite web|url=http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/f?p=100:pg:0:::1:T,V:40,|title=Statewide Transportation Improvement Program |publisher=Utah Department of Transportation|accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref><ref name="udot-arra">{{cite web|url=http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/f?p=100:pg:0:::1:T,V:2288|title=The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act|publisher=Utah Department of Transportation|accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref>
