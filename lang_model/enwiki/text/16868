'''Myrtis''' is the name given by archaeologists to an 11-year-old girl from [[ancient Athens]], whose remains were discovered in 1994<U+2013>95 in a [[mass grave]] during work to build the metro station at [[Kerameikos]], [[Greece]].<ref name="ana-mpa">{{cite web|url=http://www.ana-mpa.gr/anaweb/user/showplain?maindoc=9054577&maindocimg=8619299&service=144 |title='Myrtis' exhibition at National Archaeological Museum|publisher =ANA-MPA|date= 4/8/2011 | accessdate =8 April 2011}}</ref> The name was chosen from common ancient Greek names.<ref name= "Case Report">{{cite web|url=http://www.angle.org/doi/pdf/10.2319/012710-58.1|title=Facial reconstruction of an 11-year-old female resident of 430 BC Athens| author = Manolis J.

==Reconstruction==
[[File:Myrtis skull.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Myrtis' skull]]
Human skeletal evidence from [[Classical Greece]] is scarce, as most burials at that time were preceded by [[cremation]].  Before Myrtis, no attempt to reconstruct an Ancient Greek layperson's face has been recorded.<ref name ="Case Report"/>

Myrtis' skull was in an unusually good condition and Greek [[orthodontics]] professor Manolis Papagrigorakis requested help from Swedish specialists to recreate her facial features. A special scanner was employed for the non-invasive acquisition of high-resolution anatomic data of Myrtis' skull.  The volume of the skull was determined at 446 cm<sup>3</sup>.  Following scanning, an exact replica of her skull was created, which became the basis for subsequent [[forensic facial reconstruction]]. The reconstruction process followed the so-called "Manchester method": the facial tissues were laid from the skull surface outward by using depth marker pegs to determine thickness. The shape, size and position of the eyes, ears, nose and mouth were determined through the features of the underlying skeletal tissues. 20 different muscles were sculpted.  The thickness of the facial tissues were evaluated according to average values taken from corresponding reference tables for age, gender and race.<ref name= "Case Report"/> The mouth width and the lip thickness were estimated by the pattern and the skeletal [[craniofacial]] attributes of the associated area.<ref name="Case Report"/> Myrtis' reconstructed face was given brown eyes and brown hair, but the true colors of these can only be determined by [[DNA analysis]].<ref name="ana-mpa"/> The hairstyle she was given follows the fashion of the time.

==Dental condition==
A class II skeletal and [[dental malocclusion]] was observed in Myrtis' remains.<ref name="PubMed2">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18193954|title=Dental status and orthodontic treatment needs of an 11-year-old female resident of Athens, 430 BC|publisher =[[PubMed]]|accessdate=8 April 2011}}</ref> Other reported dental issues are the [[ectopic]] labial eruption of the [[Maxilla|maxillary]] [[Canine tooth|canines]] mesially to their retained deciduous predecessors, the ectopic distally directed eruption of a lower first [[premolar]] and a unilaterally missing lower third [[Molar (tooth)|molar]].<ref name="PubMed2"/>
