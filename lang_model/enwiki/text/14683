The '''1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens''' ([[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] = 5, 0.3&nbsp;cu&nbsp;mi, 1.2&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> of material erupted) was a major [[catastrophe|catastrophic]] [[volcano|volcanic eruption]]. The eruption was the most significant to occur in the lower 48 [[U.S. state]]s in recorded history, exceeding the destructive power and volume of material released by the 1915 eruption of [[California]]'s [[Lassen Peak]]. The eruption was preceded by a two-month-long series of [[earthquake]]s and [[steam]]-venting episodes, caused by an injection of [[magma]] at shallow depth below the mountain which created a huge bulge and a fracture system on [[Mount St. Helens]]' north slope. An earthquake at 8:32&nbsp;a.m. on [[May 18]], [[1980]], caused the entire weakened north face to slide away, suddenly exposing the partly molten, gas- and [[steam]]-rich [[rock (geology)|rock]] in the [[volcano]] to lower pressure. The rock responded by exploding into a very hot mix of pulverized [[lava]] and older rock that sped toward [[Spirit Lake (Washington)|Spirit Lake]] so fast that it quickly passed the avalanching north face.

A [[volcanic ash]] column rose high into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and deposited ash in eleven U.S. states. At the same time, snow, ice, and several entire [[glacier]]s on the mountain melted, forming a series of large [[lahar]]s (volcanic [[mudslide]]s) that reached as far as the [[Columbia River]]. Less severe outbursts continued into the next day only to be followed by other large but not as destructive eruptions later in 1980. By the time the ash settled, 57 people (including innkeeper [[Harry Truman (volcano victim)|Harry Truman]] and geologist [[David A. Johnston]]) and thousands of animals were dead, hundreds of [[square mile]]s  reduced to wasteland, over a billion [[U.S. dollar]]s in damage had occurred, and the once-graceful face of Mount St. Helens was scarred with a huge crater opened on the north side of the mountain.  The area was later preserved, as it was, in the [[Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument]].

At 12:36&nbsp;p.m. on [[March 27]], at least one but possibly two nearly simultaneous [[phreatic eruption]]s (exploding [[groundwater]]-derived [[steam]]) ejected smashed rock from within the old summit [[Volcanic crater|crater]], excavating a new crater 250&nbsp;feet (76&nbsp;m) wide<ref name="FMW88-202"/> and sending an ash column about 7,000&nbsp;feet (2,100&nbsp;m) into the air.<ref name="PrecursorMar22-28"/> By this date, a 16,000-foot-long (4900&nbsp;m), east-trending fracture system had also developed across the summit area.<ref name="FMW88-204">Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'' (1988), page 204</ref> This was followed by more earthquake storms and a series of steam explosions that sent ash 10,000 to 11,000&nbsp;feet (3,050 to 3,350&nbsp;m) above their vent.<ref name="FMW88-202"/> Most of this ash fell within 3 to 12&nbsp;miles (5 to 19&nbsp;km) from its vent but some was carried as far as 150&nbsp;miles (240&nbsp;km) south to [[Bend, Oregon]], and 285&nbsp;miles (459&nbsp;km) east to [[Spokane, Washington]].<ref name="FMW88-203">Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'' (1988), page 203</ref>

A second, new crater and a blue flame were observed on [[March 29]].<ref name="FMW88-203"/> The flame danced to and from the two craters and was probably created by burning gases.

By [[April 7]] the now combined crater was 1,700&nbsp;feet (520&nbsp;m) long, 1,200&nbsp;feet (365&nbsp;m) wide and 500&nbsp;feet (150&nbsp;m) deep.<ref name="PrecursorApr5-11">{{cite web |url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/May18/MSHThisWeek/45411/45411.htm  |year=2001|title=Mount St. Helens Precursory Activity: April 5<U+2013>11, 1980 |accessdate=2007-05-26 |publisher=United States Geological Survey }}</ref> A [[USGS]] team determined in the last week of April that a 1.5-mile-diameter (2.4&nbsp;km) section of St. Helens' north face was displaced out at least 270&nbsp;feet (82&nbsp;m).<ref name="FMW88-204"/> For the rest of April and early May this bulge grew 5 to 6&nbsp;feet per day (1.5 to 1.8&nbsp;m), and by mid-May it extended more than 400&nbsp;feet (120&nbsp;m) north.<ref name="FMW88-204"/> As the bulge moved northward, the summit area behind it progressively sank, forming a complex, down-dropped block called a [[graben]]. Geologists announced on [[April 30]] that sliding of the bulge area was the greatest immediate danger and that such a [[landslide]] might spark an eruption. These changes in the volcano's shape were related to the overall deformation that increased the volume of the mountain by 0.03&nbsp;cubic miles (0.1&nbsp;km<U+00B3>) by mid-May.<ref name="Reawakening">{{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/msh//reawakening.html |year=1997 |title=Reawakening and Initial Activity |accessdate=2007-05-31 |publisher=United States Geological Survey }}</ref> This volume increase presumably corresponded to the volume of magma that pushed into the volcano and deformed its surface. Because the intruded magma remained below ground and was not directly visible, it was called a [[cryptodome]], in contrast to a true [[lava dome]] exposed at the surface.

[[Image:St Helens April 27, 1980 showing bulge.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Photo showing the bulge on [[April 27]].]]
On [[May 7]], eruptions similar to those in March and April resumed, and over the next days the bulge approached its maximum size.<ref name="PrecursorMay3-9">{{cite web |url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/May18/MSHThisWeek/5359/5359.htm |year=2001|title=Mount St. Helens Precursory Activity: May 3<U+2013>9, 1980 |accessdate=2007-05-26 |publisher=United States Geological Survey }}</ref> All activity until this point was confined to the 350-year-old summit dome and did not involve any new [[magma]].

At 7&nbsp;a.m. on [[May 18]], USGS [[volcanology|volcanologist]] [[David A. Johnston]], who had Saturday night duty at an observation post about 6&nbsp;miles (10&nbsp;km) north of the mountain, radioed in the results of some [[laser]]-beam measurements he had made moments earlier.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> Mount St. Helens' activity that day did not show any change from the pattern of the preceding month. The rate of bulge movement, [[sulfur dioxide]] emission, and ground temperature readings did not reveal any unusual changes that might have indicated a catastrophic eruption.

Without warning, at 8:32&nbsp;a.m., a magnitude&nbsp;5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope triggered that part of the mountain to slide,<ref name="FMW88-205">Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'' (1988), page 205</ref> approximately 7<U+2013>20&nbsp;seconds (about 10&nbsp;seconds seems most reasonable) after the shock.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> One of the largest landslides in recorded history, the slide traveled at 110 to 155&nbsp;miles per hour (175 to 250&nbsp;km/h) and moved across Spirit Lake's west arm; part of it hit a 1,150-foot-high (350&nbsp;m) ridge about 6&nbsp;miles (9.5&nbsp;km) north.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> Some of the slide spilled over the ridge, but most of it moved 13&nbsp;miles (21&nbsp;km) down the North Fork [[Toutle River]],<!-- FMW205 gives 17 miles --> filling its valley up to 600&nbsp;feet (180&nbsp;m) deep with avalanche debris.<ref name="FMW88-205"/> An area of about 24&nbsp;square miles (62&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) was covered, and the total volume of the deposit was about 0.7&nbsp;cubic miles (2.9&nbsp;km<U+00B3>).<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/>

Most of St. Helens' former north side became a rubble deposit 17&nbsp;miles (27&nbsp;km) long, averaging 150&nbsp;feet (46&nbsp;m) thick; the slide was thickest at one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) below Spirit Lake and thinnest at its western margin.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> All the water in Spirit Lake was temporarily displaced by the landslide, sending 600-foot-high (180&nbsp;m) waves crashing into a ridge north of the lake,<ref name="FMW88-209"/> adding 295&nbsp;feet (90&nbsp;m) of new avalanche debris above the old lakebed, and raising its surface level by about 200&nbsp;feet (60&nbsp;m).<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> As the water moved back into its [[drainage basin|basin]], it pulled with it thousands of trees felled by a super-heated wall of volcanic gas and searing ash and rock that overtook the landslide seconds before (see below).

== Pyroclastic flows ==
=== Initial lateral blast ===
[[Image:Computer animation showing May 18, 1980 St Helens landslide.png|thumb|left|Computer graphic showing the [[May 18]] landslide (green) being overtaken by the initial pyroclastic flow (red).]]
The landslide suddenly exposed the dacite magma in St. Helens' neck to much lower pressure causing the gas-charged, partially molten rock and high-pressure steam above it to explode a few seconds after the slide started. [[Explosion]]s burst through the trailing part of the landslide, blasting rock debris northward. The resulting blast laterally directed the [[pyroclastic flow]] of very hot volcanic gases, ash and [[pumice]] from new lava, and pulverized old rock hugged the ground while initially moving at 220&nbsp;mph (350&nbsp;km/h) but quickly accelerating to 670&nbsp;mph (1080&nbsp;km/h) (it may have briefly passed the [[speed of sound]]).<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/><ref name="FMW88-205"/>

Pyroclastic flow material passed up the moving avalanche and spread outward, devastating a fan-shaped area 23&nbsp;miles (37&nbsp;km) across and 19&nbsp;miles (30&nbsp;km) long.<ref name="FMW88-205"/> In all, about 230&nbsp;[[square mile]]s (600&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of forest were knocked down<ref name="FMW88-205"/> within an 8-mile (13&nbsp;km) inner-fan area, and extreme heat killed trees miles beyond the blow-down zone. At its vent the lateral blast probably did not last longer than about 30&nbsp;seconds, but the northward radiating and expanding blast cloud continued for about another minute.

Superheated flow material flashed water in Spirit Lake and North Fork Toutle River to steam, creating a larger, secondary explosion that was heard as far away as [[British Columbia]],<ref name="FMW88-206">Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'' (1988), page 206</ref> [[Montana]], [[Idaho]], and [[Northern California]]. Yet many areas closer to the eruption ([[Portland, Oregon]], for example) did not hear the blast. This so-called "quiet zone" extended radially a few tens of miles from the volcano and was created due to the complex response of the eruption's [[sound]] waves to differences in temperature and air motion of the atmospheric layers and, to a lesser extent, local [[topography]].<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/>

=== Lateral blast result ===
Everyone in the quiet zone could see the huge ash cloud that was sent skyward from St. Helens' northern foot. The near-supersonic lateral blast, loaded with volcanic debris, caused devastation as far as 19&nbsp;miles (30&nbsp;km) from the volcano. The area affected by the blast can be subdivided into three roughly concentric zones:<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/>
#''Direct blast zone'', the innermost zone, averaged about 8&nbsp;miles (13&nbsp;km) in radius, an area in which virtually everything, natural or artificial, was obliterated or carried away.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> For this reason, this zone also has been called the "tree-removal zone." The flow of the material carried by the blast was not deflected by topographic features in this zone.
#''Channelized blast zone'', an intermediate zone, extended out to distances as far as 19&nbsp;miles (30&nbsp;km) from the volcano, an area in which the flow flattened everything in its path and was channeled to some extent by topography.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> In this zone, the force and direction of the blast are strikingly demonstrated by the parallel alignment of toppled large trees, broken off at the base of the trunk as if they were blades of grass mown by a [[scythe]]. This zone was also known as the "tree-down zone."
#''Seared zone'', also called the "standing dead" zone, the outermost fringe of the impacted area, a zone in which trees remained standing but were singed brown by the hot [[gas]]es of the blast.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> Later studies indicated that one-third of the 0.045&nbsp;cubic miles (188,000,000&nbsp;m<U+00B3>) of material in the flow was new lava, and the rest was fragmented, older rock.<ref name="FMW88-206"/>

[[Image:Reid Blackburn's car after May 18, 1980 St. Helens eruption.jpg|thumb|Photographer Reid Blackburn's car after the eruption.]]
By the time this pyroclastic flow hit its first human victims, it was still as hot as 360 <U+00B0>C (680 <U+00B0>F) and filled with suffocating gas and flying angular material.<ref name="FMW88-206">Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'' (1988), page 206</ref> Most of the 57 people known to have died in that day's eruption succumbed to [[asphyxiation]] while several died from burns.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> Lodge owner [[Harry Truman (volcano victim)|Harry Truman]] was buried under hundreds of feet (tens of meters) of avalanche material. Volcanologist [[David A. Johnston]] was one of those killed, as was [[Reid Blackburn]], a ''[[National Geographic]]'' photographer.

=== Later flows ===
Subsequent outpourings of pyroclastic material from the breach left by the landslide consisted mainly of new magmatic debris rather than fragments of preexisting volcanic rocks. The resulting deposits formed a fan-like pattern of overlapping sheets, tongues, and lobes. At least 17 separate pyroclastic flows occurred during the [[May 18]] eruption, and their aggregate volume was about&nbsp;0.05 cubic miles (208,000,000&nbsp;m<U+00B3>).<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/>

The flow deposits were still at about 300 <U+00B0>C to 420 <U+00B0>C (570 <U+00B0>F to 785 <U+00B0>F) two weeks after they erupted.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> Secondary steam-blast eruptions fed by this heat created pits on the northern margin of the pyroclastic-flow deposits, at the south shore of Spirit Lake, and along the upper part of the North Fork Toutle River. These steam-blast explosions continued sporadically for weeks or months after the emplacement of pyroclastic flows, and at least one occurred about a year later, on [[May 16]], [[1981]].<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/>

== Ash column grows ==
[[Image:St Helens May 18, 1980 showing ash column.jpg|thumb|left|Photo of the lower part of the [[May 18]] ash column.]]
As the avalanche and initial pyroclastic flow were still advancing, a huge ash column grew to a height of 12&nbsp;miles (19&nbsp;km) above the expanding crater in less than 10&nbsp;minutes and spewed [[tephra]] into the [[stratosphere]] for 10 straight hours.<ref name="FMW88-206"/> Near the volcano, the swirling ash particles in the atmosphere generated [[lightning]], which in turn started many [[forest fire]]s. During this time, parts of the now-[[Mushroom cloud|mushroom]]-shaped ash-cloud column collapsed, sending additional pyroclastic flows speeding down St. Helens' flanks. Later, slower flows came directly from the new north-facing crater and consisted of glowing pumice bombs and very hot pumiceous ash. Some of these hot flows covered ice or water which flashed to steam, creating craters up to 65&nbsp;feet (20&nbsp;m) in diameter and sending ash as much as 6,500&nbsp;feet (1980&nbsp;m) into the air.<ref name="FMW88-208">Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'' (1988), page 208</ref>

[[Image:1980 St. Helens ashmap.png|thumb|Map of ash distribution.]]
Strong high-[[altitude]] wind carried much of this material east-northeasterly from the volcano at an average speed of about 60&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h). By 9:45&nbsp;a.m. it had reached [[Yakima, Washington]], 90&nbsp;miles (145&nbsp;km) away, and by 11:45&nbsp;a.m. it was over [[Spokane, Washington]].<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/><!-- FMW206 gives 10:10am and and 2pm --> A total of 4 to 5&nbsp;inches (100 to 130&nbsp;mm) of ash fell on Yakima, and areas as far east as Spokane were plunged into darkness by noon where visibility was reduced to 10&nbsp;feet (3&nbsp;m) and half an inch (13&nbsp;mm) of ash fell.<ref name="FMW88-206"/> Continuing east, St. Helens' ash fell in the western part of [[Yellowstone National Park]] by 10:15&nbsp;p.m. and was seen on the ground in [[Denver, Colorado]], the next day.<ref name="FMW88-206"/> In time ash fall from this eruption was reported as far away as [[Minnesota]] and [[Oklahoma]], and some of the ash drifted around the globe within about 2&nbsp;weeks.

During the nine hours of vigorous eruptive activity, about 540&nbsp;million&nbsp;tons of ash fell over an area of more than 22,000&nbsp;square miles (60,000&nbsp;km<U+00B2>).<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> The total volume of the ash before its compaction by [[rain]]fall was about 0.3&nbsp;cubic miles (1.3&nbsp;km<U+00B3>).<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> The volume of the uncompacted ash is equivalent to about 0.05&nbsp;mile<U+00B3> (208,000,000&nbsp;m<U+00B3>) of solid rock, or only about 7% of the amount of material that slid off in the debris avalanche.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> By around 5:30&nbsp;p.m. on [[May 18]], the vertical ash column declined in stature, but less severe outbursts continued through the night and for several days.<ref name="FMW88-210"/>

== Mudslides flow downstream ==
[[Image:Mudline from 1980 St Helens lahars next to Muddy River.jpg|thumb|left|Mudline next to Muddy River from the 1980 [[lahar]]s.]]
The hot, exploding material also broke apart and melted nearly all of the mountain's [[glacier]]s along with most of the overlying snow. As in many previous St. Helens' eruptions, this created huge [[lahar]]s (volcanic [[mudflow]]s) and muddy floods that affected three of the four stream drainage systems on the mountain,<ref name="FMW88-208"/> and which started to move as early as 8:50 a.m.<ref name="FMW88-209">Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'' (1988), page 209</ref> Lahars traveled as fast as 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h) while still high on the volcano but progressively slowed to about 3&nbsp;mph (5&nbsp;km/h) on the flatter and wider parts of rivers.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> Mudflows from the southern and eastern flanks had the consistency of wet concrete as they raced down Muddy River, Pine Creek, and Smith Creek to their confluence at the [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]]. Bridges were taken out at the mouth of Pine Creek and the head of Swift Reservoir, which rose 2.6&nbsp;feet (0.8&nbsp;m)<ref name="FMW88-208"/> by noon to accommodate the nearly 18&nbsp;million&nbsp;cubic yards (13&nbsp;million&nbsp;m<U+00B3>) of additional water, mud, and debris.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/>

Glacier and snow melt mixed with tephra on the volcano's northeast slope to create much larger lahars. These mudflows traveled down the north and south forks of the Toutle River and joined at the confluence of the Toutle forks and the [[Cowlitz River]] near [[Castle Rock, Washington]], at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. Ninety minutes after the eruption, the first mudflow had moved 27&nbsp;river miles (43&nbsp;km) upstream where observers at [[Weyerhaeuser]]'s Camp Baker saw a 12-foot-high (3.7&nbsp;m) wall of muddy water and debris pass.<ref name="FMW88-209"/> Near the confluence of the Toutle's north and south forks at [[Silver Lake]], a record [[flood stage]] of 23.5&nbsp;feet (7.2&nbsp;m) was recorded.<ref name="FMW88-209"/>

A large but slower-moving mudflow with a mortar-like consistency was mobilized in early afternoon at the head of the Toutle River north fork. By 2:30&nbsp;p.m. the massive mudflow had destroyed Camp Baker,<ref name="FMW88-209"/> and in the following hours seven bridges were carried away. Part of the flow backed up for 2.5&nbsp;miles (4&nbsp;km) soon after entering the Cowlitz River but most continued downstream. After traveling 17&nbsp;miles (27&nbsp;km) more, an estimated 3.9&nbsp;million&nbsp;cubic yards (3.0&nbsp;million&nbsp;m<U+00B3>) of material were injected into the [[Columbia River]], reducing the river's depth by 25&nbsp;feet (7.6&nbsp;m) for a four-mile (6&nbsp;km) stretch.<ref name="FMW88-209"/> The resulting 13-foot (4&nbsp;m) river depth temporarily closed the busy channel to [[ocean]]-going [[freighter]]s, costing [[Portland, Oregon]] an estimated five million [[US dollar]]s.<ref name="FMW88-210">Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'' (1988), page 210</ref> Ultimately more than 65&nbsp;million&nbsp;cubic yards (50&nbsp;million&nbsp;m<U+00B3>) of sediment were dumped along the lower Cowlitz and Columbia Rivers.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/>

U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] surveyed the damage and stated it looked more desolate than a [[moon]]scape. A film crew was dropped by helicopter on St. Helens on [[May 23]] to document the destruction. Their [[compass]]es, however, spun in circles and they quickly became lost. A second eruption occurred the next day (see below), but the crew survived and were rescued two days after that.

In all, St. Helens released an amount of [[energy]] equivalent to 27,000&nbsp;[[Little Boy|Hiroshima]]-sized [[nuclear weapon]]s and ejected more than 1&nbsp;[[cubic mile]] (4&nbsp;km<U+00B3>) of material.<ref name="FMW88-211">Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'' (1988), page 211</ref> A quarter of that volume was fresh lava in the form of ash, pumice, and volcanic bombs while the rest was fragmented, older [[rock (geology)|rock]].<ref name="FMW88-211"/> The removal of the north side of the mountain (13% of the cone's volume) reduced St. Helens' height by about 1,313&nbsp;feet (400&nbsp;m) and left a crater 1 to 2&nbsp;miles (2 to 3&nbsp;km) wide and 2,100&nbsp;feet (640&nbsp;m) deep with its north end open in a huge breach.<ref name="FMW88-211"/>

[[Image:St Helens in September 1980.jpg|thumb|right|St. Helens in September 1980.]]
More than 4&nbsp;billion&nbsp;[[board feet]] (14.6&nbsp;km<U+00B3>) of [[timber]] were damaged or destroyed, mainly by the lateral blast.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/><!-- FMW206 gives "about a billion" --> At least 25% of the destroyed timber was salvaged after September 1980. Downwind of the volcano, in areas of thick ash accumulation, many agricultural crops, such as wheat, apples, potatoes, and [[alfalfa]], were destroyed. As many as 1,500 [[elk]] and 5,000 [[deer]] were killed, and an estimated 12 million<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> [[Chinook salmon|Chinook]] and [[Coho salmon|Coho]] [[salmon]] fingerlings died when their hatcheries were destroyed. Another estimated 40,000 young [[salmon]] were lost when they swam through [[turbine]] blades of [[hydroelectric]] generators due to the need to have low [[lake|reservoirs]] levels along the Lewis River to accommodate possible mudflows and [[flood]] waters.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/>

=== Digging out ===
The ash fall created some temporary but major problems with [[transportation]], [[sewage]] disposal, and [[water treatment]] systems. Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. [[Interstate 90]] from [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] to [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] was closed for a week and a half.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> Air travel was disrupted for a few days to 2&nbsp;weeks as several airports in eastern Washington shut down due to ash accumulation and poor visibility. Over a thousand commercial flights were canceled following airport closures.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for [[internal-combustion engine]]s and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters, and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused [[short circuit]]s in electrical transformers, which in turn caused power [[blackout]]s.

Removing and disposing of the ash was a monumental task for some eastern Washington communities. State and Federal agencies estimated that over 2.4&nbsp;million&nbsp;cubic yards (1.8&nbsp;million&nbsp;m<U+00B3>) of ash&nbsp;&mdash; equivalent to about 900,000&nbsp;tons in weight&nbsp;&mdash; were removed from highways and airports in Washington.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> Ash removal cost $2.2&nbsp;million and took 10&nbsp;weeks in Yakima.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> The need to remove ash quickly from transport routes and civil works dictated the selection of some disposal sites. Some cities used old quarries and existing sanitary [[landfill]]s; others created dumpsites wherever expedient. To minimize wind reworking of ash dumps, the surfaces of some disposal sites have since been covered with topsoil and seeded with grass.

=== Cost ===
[[Image:Home destroyed by 1980 St Helens eruption1.jpg|thumb|One of the 200 homes destroyed by the eruption.]]
Early estimates of the cost of the eruption ranged from [[U.S. dollar|US$]]2<U+2013>3&nbsp;[[1000000000 (number)|billion]].<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> A refined estimate of $1.1&nbsp;billion was determined in a study by the [[International Trade Commission]] at the request of the [[United States Congress]].<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> A supplemental appropriation of $951&nbsp;million for disaster relief was voted by Congress, of which the largest share went to the [[Small Business Administration]], [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], and the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]].<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/>

There were also indirect and intangible costs of the eruption. [[Unemployment]] in the immediate region of Mount St. Helens rose tenfold in the weeks immediately following the eruption, and then returned to nearly normal once timber salvaging and ash-cleanup operations were underway. Only a small percentage of residents left the region because of lost jobs owing to the eruption.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/> Several months after [[May 18]], a few residents reported suffering [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] and [[emotion]]al problems, even though they had coped successfully during the crisis. Counties in the region requested funding for mental health programs to assist such people.

Initial public reaction to the [[May 18]] eruption nearly dealt a crippling blow to [[tourism]], an important industry in Washington. Not only was tourism down in the Mount St. Helens<U+2013>[[Gifford Pinchot National Forest]] area, but conventions, meetings, and social gatherings also were canceled or postponed at cities and resorts elsewhere in Washington and neighboring [[Oregon]] not affected by the eruption. The adverse effect on tourism and conventioneering, however, proved only temporary. Mount St. Helens, perhaps because of its reawakening, has regained its appeal for tourists. The [[National Forest Service]] and the State of Washington opened visitor centers and provided access for people to view the volcano's devastation.<ref name="TillingPastClimactic"/>

== Later eruptions ==
{{Further|[[2004 and later volcanic activity of Mount St. Helens]]}}
St. Helens produced five more explosive eruptions between May and October 1980. Through early 1990, a total of at least 21 periods of eruptive activity had occurred. The volcano remains active, with smaller, dome-building eruptions continuing into 2007.

[[Image:St Helens July 22, 1980 eruption.jpg|thumb|Eruption on [[July 22]] [[1980]].]]
An eruption occurred on [[May 25]] [[1980]] at 2:30&nbsp;a.m. that sent an ash column 9&nbsp;miles (14&nbsp;km) into the atmosphere.<ref name="FMW88-211"/> The eruption was preceded by a sudden increase in earthquake activity and occurred during a [[rain]] storm. Erratic [[wind]] from the storm carried ash from the eruption to the south and west, lightly dusting large parts of western Washington and [[Oregon]]. Pyroclastic flows exited the northern breach and covered avalanche debris, lahars, and other pyroclastic flows deposited by the [[May 18]] eruption.<ref name="FMW88-211"/>

At 7:05&nbsp;p.m. on [[June 12]], a plume of ash billowed 2.5&nbsp;miles (4&nbsp;km) above the volcano. At 9:09&nbsp;p.m. a much stronger explosion sent an ash column about 10&nbsp;miles (16&nbsp;km) skyward.<ref name="FMW88-212">Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'' (1988), page 212</ref> A [[dacite]] dome then oozed into existence on the crater floor, growing to a height of 200&nbsp;feet (60&nbsp;m) and a width of 1,200&nbsp;feet (370&nbsp;m) within a week.<ref name="FMW88-212"/>

A series of large explosions on [[July 22]] broke more than a month of relative quiet. The July eruptive episode was preceded by several days of measurable expansion of the summit area, heightened earthquake activity, and changed emission rates of [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. The first hit at 5:14&nbsp;p.m. as an ash column shot 10&nbsp;miles (16&nbsp;km) and was followed by a faster blast at 6:25&nbsp;p.m. that pushed the ash column above its previous maximum height in just 7.5&nbsp;minutes.<ref name="FMW88-212"/> The final explosion started at 7:01&nbsp;p.m. and continued for over two hours.<ref name="FMW88-212"/> When the relatively small amount of ash settled over eastern Washington, the dome built in June was gone.<ref name="FMW88-213">Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'' (1988), page 213</ref>

[[Image:St Helens dome on October 24, 1980.jpg|thumb|left|The growing third dome on [[October 24]] [[1980]].]]
Seismic activity and gas emission steadily increased in early August, and on [[August 7]] at 4:26&nbsp;p.m., an ash cloud slowly expanded 8 miles (13&nbsp;km) into the sky.<ref name="FMW88-213"/> Small pyroclastic flows were sent through the northern breach and weaker outpouring of ash rose from the crater. This continued until 10:32&nbsp;p.m. when a second large blast sent ash high into the air.<ref name="FMW88-213"/> A second dacite dome filled this vent a few days later.

Two months of repose were ended by an eruption lasting from [[October 16]] to [[October 18]]. This event obliterated the second dome, sent ash 10&nbsp;miles (16&nbsp;km) in the air and created small, red-hot [[pyroclastic]] flows.<ref name="FMW88-213"/> A third dome began to form within 30&nbsp;minutes after the final explosion on [[October 18]], and within a few days, it was about 900&nbsp;feet (270&nbsp;m) wide and 130&nbsp;feet (40&nbsp;m) high. In spite of the dome growth next to it, [[Tulutson Glacier|a new glacier]] formed rapidly inside the crater.

All of the post-1980 eruptions were quiet dome-building events, beginning with the [[December 27]], [[1980]], to [[January 3]], [[1981]], episode. By 1987 the third dome had grown to be more than 3,000&nbsp;feet (900&nbsp;m) wide and 800&nbsp;feet (240&nbsp;m) high.<ref name="FMW88-213"/> At that rate, assuming additional destructive eruptions do not occur, St. Helens' summit would be restored to its previous height sometime in the mid to late 22nd century. 

Further eruptions occurred over a few months during 1989<U+2013>1991, and the mountain became active again in late 2004.
