'''B<U+00E9>la the Blind''' ({{lang-hu|Vak B<U+00E9>la}}; {{lang-hr|Bela Slijepi}}; {{lang-sk|Belo Slep<U+00FD>}}; {{circa}} 1109&nbsp;<U+2013> 13 February 1141) was [[King of Hungary]] and [[King of Croatia|Croatia]] from 1131. He was blinded along with his rebellious father [[<U+00C1>lmos, Duke of Croatia|<U+00C1>lmos]] on the order of <U+00C1>lmos's brother, King [[Coloman of Hungary]]. B<U+00E9>la grew up in monasteries during the reign of Coloman's son [[Stephen II of Hungary|Stephen II]]. The childless king arranged B<U+00E9>la's marriage with [[Helena of Rascia]], who would become her husband's co-ruler throughout his reign.

B<U+00E9>la was crowned king at least two months after the death of Stephen II, implying that his accession to the throne did not happen without opposition. Two violent purges were carried out among the partisans of his predecessors to strengthen B<U+00E9>la's rule. King Coloman's alleged son [[Boris Kalamanos|Boris]] tried to dethrone B<U+00E9>la but the king and his allies defeated the pretender's troops in 1132. In the second half of B<U+00E9>la's reign, Hungary adopted an active foreign policy. [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Split, Croatia|Split]] seem to have accepted B<U+00E9>la's suzerainty around 1136.
