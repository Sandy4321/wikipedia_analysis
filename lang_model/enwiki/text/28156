'''USS ''Connecticut'' (BB-18)''', the fourth [[United States Navy]] ship to be named after the [[Connecticut|fifth state]], was the [[lead ship]] of the six {{Sclass|Connecticut|battleship}}s. Due to the [[Royal Navy]]'s commissioning of {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} seven months earlier, ''Connecticut'' was obsolete before she was commissioned; thus, she was the last lead ship of any class of [[pre-dreadnought]] battleship commissioned by the United States Navy.

''Connecticut'' served as a [[flagship]] for the [[Jamestown Exposition]], which commemorated the 300th anniversary of the founding of the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] colony. She later sailed with the [[Great White Fleet]] on a circumnavigation of the Earth to showcase the United States Navy's growing fleet of [[Blue-water navy|blue-water]]-capable ships. After completing her service with the Great White Fleet, ''Connecticut'' participated in several flag-waving exercises intended to protect American citizens abroad until she was pressed into service as a troop transport at the end of [[World War I]] to expedite the return of [[American Expeditionary Force]]s from France.

For the remainder of her career, ''Connecticut'' sailed to various places in both the Atlantic and Pacific while training newer recruits to the Navy. However, the provisions of the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]] stipulated that many of the older battleships, ''Connecticut'' among them, would have to be disposed of, so she was decommissioned on 1 March 1922 and sold for scrap on 1 November 1923.

== Design ==
[[File:12-45 mk5 Connecticut gun pic.jpg|thumb|left|One of the bow 12-inch main guns being installed on 31 January 1908]]

The design that evolved into the {{Sclass|Connecticut|battleship|2}} was conceived on 6 March 1901 when [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[John Davis Long]] asked the Board on Construction for a study of future battleship designs. When this was completed, different bureaus supported different designs. The Board on Construction favored a ship on which {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} and {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} guns would be replaced by twenty-four newly designed {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}} guns, which were the most powerful guns with shells that could be handled by one person.<ref name=note group=A>The shell for the 7-inch guns weighed {{convert|165|lb|kg}}, whereas a shell for the 6-inch gun weighed about {{convert|100|lb|kg}}, and the shell for the 8-inch gun weighed about {{convert|250|lb|kg}}. These 250-pound shells could only be moved by "power or several men", making the 7-inch gun "the largest [gun] capable of really rapid fire in the context of existing technology".</ref> In addition, the ship would mount twenty-four {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} anti-[[torpedo boat]] guns.<ref>Friedman (1985), p. 43</ref> The main armor would be thinner because armor would be distributed throughout the ship. <!--whaaat? Also, {{convert|19|knots|mph}}--> The Board's favored design would result in a ship weighing 15,560&nbsp;tons [[displacement (ship)|displacement]]. The [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]], however, proposed a modified {{Sclass|Virginia|battleship|2}} with sixteen 8-inch guns, twelve in turrets and four in [[casemate]]s; the casemate guns were later eliminated, leaving twelve 8-inch, twelve 6-inch, and eight 3-inch guns on a ship of 15,860&nbsp;tons. This design was later rejected because the reduction in anti-torpedo boat guns was too drastic.<ref name="Friedman44"/>

Although one of the two designs had been rejected, the debate did not end. In November, the Board decided on a different plan, with eight 8-inch guns mounted in four waist turrets and twelve 7-inch guns. This arrangement was chosen because the 8-inch gun could penetrate medium armor on battleships, and the 7-inch gun was capable of rapid fire.<ref name=note group=A/> The new design also had heavier armor and a thicker belt than the first design. Two ships of this plan, ''Connecticut'' and {{USS|Louisiana|BB-19|2}}, were authorized on 1 July 1902, and three more were added on 2 March 1903: {{USS|Vermont|BB-20|2}}, {{USS|Kansas|BB-21|2}}, and {{USS|Minnesota|BB-22|2}}.<ref name="Friedman44"/><ref group=A>{{USS|New Hampshire|BB-25|2}} was authorized on 27 April 1904. The reason for the long gap were the two {{Sclass|Mississippi|battleship|2}}s that were built between ''Minnesota'' and ''New Hampshire''. This class was the result of trying to "prune back the growth of battleship size and cost" by a "congressionally limited displacement". However, as they had to cut down the ''Connecticut'' design by a little less than 20%, the designs were not very successful, and those ships were sold about six years after being commissioned.

Three attempts to sabotage the ship were discovered in 1904.

''Connecticut'' sailed out of New York for the first time on 15 December 1906, becoming the first ship in the U.S. Navy to ever go to sea without a [[sea trial]].<ref>{{Cite news | date = 16 December 1906 | title = The Connecticut sails on her maiden trip | work= The New York Times | page = 13 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9401EEDE1731E733A25755C1A9649D946797D6CF | format = pdf | accessdate = 5 February 2009 | dateformat = dmy}}</ref> She first journeyed south to the [[Virginia Capes]], where she conducted a variety of training exercises; this was followed by [[Shakedown (testing)|shakedown training]] and battle practice off Cuba and Puerto Rico.<ref name="Albertson36">Albertson (2007), p. 36</ref> During the cruise, she participated in a search for the missing steamer ''Ponce''.<ref>{{Cite news | date = 9 February 1907 | title = Still without tidings of steamship Ponce | work= The New York Times | page = 16 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A02E1DA153EE033A2575AC0A9679C946697D6CF | format = pdf | accessdate = 5 February 2009 | dateformat = dmy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | date = 11 January 1907 | title = Hope for Ponce grows with Maracas delay | work= The New York Times | page = 16 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9500E4D61130E233A25752C1A9679C946697D6CF | format = pdf | accessdate = 5 February 2009 | dateformat = dmy}}</ref><ref group=A>''Ponce'' was eventually found and towed back to port by a German freighter; the seven passengers were taken off by the Quebec liner ''Bermudian''.

This apparent attempt at a cover-up was enough for the [[United States Congress]] to consider an official inquiry into the matter.<ref>{{Cite news | date = 6 February 1907 | title = Connecticut's plates driven upward by reef | work= The New York Times | page = 5 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=990DEFD7153EE033A25755C0A9649C946697D6CF | format = pdf | accessdate = 5 February 2009 | dateformat = dmy}}</ref>

On 21 March, the Navy announced that Swift would be [[court-martial]]ed for "through negligence, causing a vessel to run upon a rock" and "neglect of duty in regard to the above".<ref>{{Cite news | date = 21 March 1907 | title = Court-martial for Swift| work= The New York Times | page = 5 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E0CE4DB123EE033A25752C2A9659C946697D6CF | format = pdf | accessdate = 5 February 2009 | dateformat = dmy}}</ref> Along with the officer of the deck at the time of the accident, Lt.

Four cruisers from Argentina, ''San Martin'', ''Buenos Ayres'', ''9 De Julio'', and ''Pueyrredon'', all under the command of Admiral Hipolito Oliva, sailed {{convert|300|nmi|km}} to salute the American ships on their way to Chile. The fleet arrived at Punta Arenas on 1 February and spent five days in the town of 14,000.<ref>Albertson (2007), p. 44</ref> Heading north, they followed the coastline of Chile, passing in review of Chilean President [[Pedro Montt]] on 14 February outside of [[Valpara<U+00ED>so]], and they were escorted to [[Callao]] in Peru by the cruiser [[BAP Coronel Bolognesi (1906)|''Coronel Bolognesi'']] on 19 and 20 February.<ref>Albertson (2007), pp. 44&ndash;45</ref> Peru's president, [[Jos<U+00E9> Pardo y Barreda|Jos<U+00E9> Pardo]], came on board ''Connecticut'' during this time, as Rear Admiral Evans was quite ill and could not go ashore.<ref>Albertson (2007), p. 45</ref> After taking on coal, the ships steamed for Mexico on 29 February, passing in review of the cruiser [[BAP Almirante Grau (1907)|''Almirante Grau'']], which had Pardo embarked, before leaving.<ref name="Albertson46">Albertson (2007), p. 46</ref>

Arriving in Mexico on 20 March, the fleet underwent three weeks of target practice. Rear Admiral Evans was relieved of command during this time, as he was completely bedridden and in constant pain, so on 30 March ''Connecticut'' set sail north at full speed. She was met two days later by the schooner {{USS|Yankton|1893|2}}, which took the admiral to a hospital. ''Connecticut'' traveled back south to rejoin the fleet,<ref name="Albertson46"/> and Rear Admiral [[Charles M. Thomas]] took Evans's place on ''Connecticut'' as the commander of the fleet, which continued its journey north, bound for [[California]].<ref name="Albertson47">Albertson (2007), p. 47</ref>

On 5 May, Evans returned to ''Connecticut'' in time for the fleet's sailing through the [[Golden Gate]] on 6 May,<ref name="Albertson47"/> although he was still in pain.<ref name="Albertson48">Albertson (2007), p. 48</ref> Over one million people watched the forty-two-ship fleet sail into the bay.<ref group=A>The Great White Fleet was joined by various Pacific Fleet warships and a torpedo boat flotilla for their entrance into the harbor, making the conglomerate of ships the "most powerful concentration of naval might yet gathered in the Western Hemisphere".

Leaving Hawaii on 22 July, the ships next stopped at [[Auckland]], [[Sydney]], and [[Melbourne]]. High seas and winds hampered the ships for part of the voyage to New Zealand, but they arrived on 9 August; festivities, parades, balls, and games were staples of the visits to each city.<ref>Albertson (2007), pp. 52&ndash;56</ref> The highlight of the austral visit was a parade of 12,000 U.S. Navy, [[Royal Navy]], and [[Commonwealth]] naval and military personnel in front of 250,000 people.<ref>Albertson (2007), p. 54</ref>

After stopping at [[Manila]] in the Philippines, the fleet set course for [[Yokohama]], Japan. They encountered a typhoon on the way on 12 October, but no ships were lost; the fleet was only delayed 24&nbsp;hours.<ref>Albertson (2007), pp. 57&ndash;58</ref> After three Japanese [[men-of-war]] and six merchantmen escorted the Americans in, festivities began.

After port calls were concluded, the ships headed for [[Gibraltar]], where they found a conglomerate of warships from many different nations awaiting them "with decks manned and horns blaring": the battleships {{HMS|Albemarle|1901|2}} and {{HMS|Albion|1898|2}} with the cruiser {{HMS|Devonshire|1904|2}} and the Second Cruiser Squadron represented Great Britain's [[Royal Navy]], battleships [[Russian battleship Tsesarevich|''Tsesarevich'']] and [[Russian battleship Slava|''Slava'']] with cruisers [[Russian cruiser Boygatyr|''Bogatyr'']] and [[Russian cruiser Oleg|''Oleg'']] represented the [[Imperial Russian Navy]], and various gunboats represented France and the Netherlands. After coaling for five days, the ships got under way and left for home on 6 February 1909.<ref>Albertson (2007), pp. 63&ndash;64</ref>

After weathering a few storms, the ships met nine of their fellow U.S. Navy ships five days out of Hampton Roads: four battleships ({{USS|Maine|BB-10|2}}, {{USS|Mississippi|BB-23|2}}, {{USS|Idaho|BB-24|2}}, and {{USS|New Hampshire|BB-25|2}}&mdash;the only sister of ''Connecticut'' to not make the cruise, two armored cruisers, and three scout cruisers.<ref>Albertson (2007), pp. 64&ndash;65</ref> ''Connecticut'' then led all of these warships around Tail-of-the-Horseshoe Lightship on 22 February to pass in review of President Roosevelt, who was then on the presidential yacht anchored off [[Old Point Comfort]], ending a {{convert|46729|nmi|km|adj=on}} trip. Roosevelt boarded the ship after she anchored and gave a short speech, saying, "You've done the trick. Other nations may do as you have done, but they'll follow you."<ref>Albertson (2007), pp. 65&ndash;66</ref>

== Prewar ==
Following her return from the world cruise, ''Connecticut'' continued to serve as flagship of the Atlantic Fleet, interrupted only by a March 1909 overhaul at the New York Navy Yard.<ref>Albertson (2007), p. 66</ref> After rejoining the fleet, she cruised the East Coast from her base at [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. Throughout the rest of 1909, the battleship conducted training and participated in ceremonial observances, such as the [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]].<ref name=DANFS/><ref>Albertson (2007), pp. 66&ndash;67</ref> In early January 1910, ''Connecticut'' left for Cuban waters and stayed there until late March when she returned to New York for a refit.<ref name="Albertson67">Albertson (2007), p. 67</ref> After several months conducting maneuvers and battle practice off the [[New England]] coast, she left for Europe on 2 November to go on a midshipman training cruise.<ref name="Albertson67"/> She arrived in [[Isle of Portland|Portland]], England, on 15 November and was present during the 1 December birthday celebration of [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]], the [[queen mother]]. ''Connecticut'' next visited [[Cherbourg]], France, where she welcomed visitors from the town and also hosted commander-in-chief of the [[French Navy]] ''Vice-Amiral'' [[Laurent Marin-Darbel]], and a delegation of his officers. While there, a boat crew from ''Connecticut'' engaged a crew from the French battleship {{ship|French battleship|Charles Martel|1893|2}} in a rowing race; ''Connecticut''{{'}}s crew won by twelve lengths. ''Connecticut'' departed French waters for [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]], Cuba, on 30 December,<ref name="Albertson68">Albertson (2007), p. 68</ref> and stayed there until 17 March, when she departed for Hampton Roads.<ref>Albertson (2007), pp. 68&ndash;69</ref>

[[File:USS Connecticut (BB 8) Dressed with flags.jpg|thumb|left|''Connecticut'' saluting the presidential yacht {{USS|Mayflower|PY-1|2}} during the Presidential Fleet Review in 1911]]

''Connecticut'' was the leader of the ships that passed in review during the Presidential Fleet Review in New York on 2 November; she then remained in New York until 12 January 1912, when she returned to Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay. During a March overhaul at the [[Philadelphia Naval Yard]], the battleship relinquished her role as flagship to the armored cruiser {{USS|Washington|ACR-11|2}}. After the overhaul's completion, ''Connecticut'''s activities through the end of 1912 included practicing with torpedoes in [[Fort Pond Bay]], conducting fleet maneuvers, and battle practice off [[Block Island]] and the Virginia Capes.<ref name="Albertson69">Albertson (2007), p. 69</ref> Stopping in New York, ''Connecticut'' conducted training exercises in Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay from 13 February to 20 March and once again became the Atlantic Fleet flagship for a brief and final time when she served in the interim as Rear Admiral [[Charles J.

On 22 June 1912, ''Connecticut'' departed Mexican waters for Philadelphia, where she was dry docked for three months of repairs. Upon their completion, ''Connecticut'' conducted gunnery practice off the Virginia Capes. On 23 October, ''Connecticut'' became the flagship of the Fourth Battleship Division. After the division passed in review before Secretary of the Navy [[George von Lengerke Meyer]]<!--

On 29 May 1914, while still in Mexico, ''Connecticut'' relinquished the duty of flagship to {{USS|Minnesota|BB-22|2}}, but remained in Mexico until 2 July, when she left for [[Havana]]. Arriving there on 8 July, ''Connecticut'' embarked [[Madison R. Smith]], the U.S. minister to Haiti, and took him to [[Port-au-Prince]], arriving five days later. ''Connecticut'' remained in Haiti for a month, then left for Philadelphia on 8 August and arrived there on 14 August.<ref name="Albertson71"/>

''Connecticut'' then went to [[Maine]] and the Virginia Capes for battle practice, after which she went into the Philadelphia Naval Yard for an overhaul. After more than fifteen weeks, ''Connecticut'' emerged on 15 January 1915 and steamed south to Cuba, where she conducted training exercises before returning to Philadelphia. She remained there until 31 July, when she embarked 433 men from the Second Regiment, First Brigade, of the [[United States Marine Corps]] for transport to Port-au-Prince, where they were put ashore on 5 August as part of the [[United States occupation of Haiti|U.S. occupation of Haiti]]. ''Connecticut'' delivered supplies to amphibious troops in [[Cap-Ha<U+00EF>tien]] on 5 September and remained near Haiti for the next few months, supporting landing parties ashore, including detachments of Marines and sailors from ''Connecticut'' under the command of Major [[Smedley Butler]]. After departing Haiti, ''Connecticut'' arrived in Philadelphia on 15 December and was placed into the [[United States Navy reserve fleets|Atlantic reserve fleet]].<ref name="Albertson72">Albertson (2007), p. 72</ref>

== World War I and post-war service ==
As part of the U.S. response to Germany's [[unrestricted submarine warfare (February 1915)|unrestricted submarine warfare]], ''Connecticut'' was recommissioned on 3 October 1916. Two days later, Admiral [[Herbert O. Dunn]] made her the flagship of the Fifth Battleship Division, transferring his flag from ''Minnesota''.<ref name="Albertson73">Albertson (2007), p. 73</ref> ''Connecticut'' operated along the East Coast and in the Caribbean until the United States entered [[World War I]] on 6 April 1917.<ref name=DANFS/><ref>See: [[s:Woodrow Wilson Urges Congress to Declare War on Germany|Woodrow Wilson Urges Congress to Declare War on Germany]]&mdash;text of a speech given by Wilson before Congress</ref> For the duration of the war, ''Connecticut'' was based in [[York River, Virginia]].<ref name="overview" /> More than 1,000 trainees<U+2014>midshipmen and gun crews for merchant ships<U+2014>took part in exercises on her while she sailed in [[Chesapeake Bay]] and off the Virginia Capes.<ref name=DANFS/><ref name="Albertson73"/>

At the close of the war, ''Connecticut'' was assigned to the [[Cruiser and Transport Force]] for transport duty, and between 6 January and 22 June 1919 she made four voyages to return troops from France.<!-- number of voyages, unit assignment --><ref name=Gleaves-250>Gleaves (1921), pp. 250<U+2013>51</ref><ref name=Alb-73-74>Albertson (2007), p. 73&ndash;74</ref><!-- balance of details --> On 6 January, she left Hampton Roads for [[Brest, France]], where she embarked 1,000 troops.

These men were delivered to Hampton Roads on 24 March. After two months, ''Connecticut'' made another run overseas: following a short period of liberty in Paris for her crew, she embarked 891 men variously from the 502nd Army Engineers, a medical detachment, and the Red Cross. They were dropped off in [[Newport News]] on 22 June.<ref name="Albertson74">Albertson (2007), p. 74</ref> On 23 June 1919, after having returned over 4,800 men,<ref name=Gleaves-250 /> ''Connecticut'' was reassigned as flagship of the Second Battleship Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet,<ref name=DANFS/> under the command of Vice Admiral [[Hilary P. Jones]].<ref name="Albertson74"/>

[[File:USS Connecticut (BB 8) 1920.jpg|thumb|left|''Connecticut'' photographed in 1920]]

While based in Philadelphia for the next eleven months, ''Connecticut'' trained midshipmen. On 2 May 1920, 200 midshipmen boarded the ship for a training cruise. In company with the other battleships of her squadron, ''Connecticut'' sailed to the Caribbean and through the Panama Canal in order to visit four ports-of-call: Honolulu, Seattle, San Francisco, and [[San Pedro Bay (California)|San Pedro Bay]] (Los Angeles and [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]). After visiting all four, the squadron made their way back through the canal and headed for home. However, the port engine of ''Connecticut'' gave out three days after transiting the canal, requiring ''New Hampshire'' to tow the battleship into Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay. The pair arrived on 28 August.<ref name="Albertson74"/> The midshipmen were debarked there,<ref name="Albertson75">Albertson (2007), p. 75</ref> and Vice Admiral Jones transferred his flag from ''Connecticut'' to his new flagship, {{USS|Kansas|BB-21|2}}.<ref name="Albertson74"/> The Navy repair ship {{USS|Prometheus|AR-3|2}} was dispatched from New York on 1 September to tow ''Connecticut'' to Philadelphia;<ref>{{cite DANFS | title = Prometheus | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/p12/prometheus-ii.htm | accessdate=3 February 2009 |dateformat=dmy |link = off}}</ref> they arrived at the Navy Yard there on 11 September.<ref name="Albertson75"/>

On 21 March 1921, ''Connecticut'' again became the flagship of the Second Battleship Squadron when Rear Admiral [[Charles Frederick Hughes]] took command. The ships of the squadron departed Philadelphia on 7 April to perform maneuvers and training exercises off Cuba, though they returned to take part in the Presidential Review in Hampton Roads on 28 April. After participating in [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]] celebrations on [[Memorial Day]], ''Connecticut'' and her squadmates departed on a midshipman cruise which took them to Europe. On 28 June, ''Connecticut'' hosted a Norwegian delegation that included [[King of Norway|King]] [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]], [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime Minister]] [[Otto Blehr]], the Minister of Defence, and the First Sea Lord of the [[Norwegian Navy]]. After arriving in Portugal on 21 July, the battleship hosted the Civil Governor of the Province of Lisbon and the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Portuguese Navy]]. Six days later ''Connecticut'' hosted the Portuguese president, [[Ant<U+00F3>nio Jos<U+00E9> de Almeida]].<ref name="Albertson75"/> The battleship squadron departed for Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay on 29 July and, after arrival there, remained for gunnery practice and exercises. ''Connecticut'', leaving the rest of the squadron, departed for Annapolis and disembarked her midshipmen on 30 August, then proceded to Philadelphia.<ref name="Albertson76">Albertson (2007), p. 76</ref>

''Connecticut'' departed Philadelphia for California on 4 October for duty with the Pacific Fleet. After touching at San Diego on the 27th, she arrived on 28 October at [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]], where Rear Admiral [[Herman Osman Stickney|H.O. Stickney]] designated her the flagship of Pacific Fleet Training.<ref name="Albertson76">Albertson (2007), p. 76</ref> For the next few months, ''Connecticut'' cruised along the West Coast, taking part in exercises and commemorations.<ref name=DANFS/> Under the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], which set tonnage limits for its signatory nations, the Navy designated ''Connecticut'' for scrapping. Getting under way for her final voyage on 11 December, she made a five-day journey to the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]],<ref name="Albertson76"/> where she was decommissioned on 1 March 1923.<ref name=DANFS/><ref>Albertson (2007), p. 76&ndash;77</ref> On 1 November,<ref name=DANFS/> the ex-''Connecticut'' was sold for scrap to Walter W.
