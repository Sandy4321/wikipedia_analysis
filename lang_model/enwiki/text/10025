{{Politics of the European Union mini}}

The '''European Parliament''' ('''Europarl''' or '''EP''') is the [[direct election|directly elected]] [[parliament]]ary institution of the [[European Union]] (EU). Together with the [[Council of the European Union]] (the Council), it forms the [[bicameral]] [[Institutions of the European Union#Legislature|legislative branch]] of the [[Institutions of the European Union|Union's institutions]] and has been described as one of the most powerful legislatures in the world.<ref name="Farrell Powerful"/> The Parliament and Council form the highest legislative body within the Union. However their powers as such are limited to the competencies conferred upon the [[European Community]] by [[Member State of the European Union|member states]]. Hence the institution has little control over [[policy]] areas held by the states and within the other two of the [[three pillars of the European Union]]. The Parliament is composed of 736 MEPs ([[Member of the European Parliament]]), who serve the second largest [[Liberal democracy|democratic]] [[Constituency|electorate]] in the world (after [[India]]) and the largest trans-national democratic electorate in the world (375 million eligible voters in 2009).<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/07/AR2009060702402.html The Washington Post, June 8, 2009</ref><ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jun/07/eu-elections-social-democrats The Guardian, Monday 8 June 2009</ref>

It has been directly elected every five years by [[universal suffrage]] since 1979. Although the European Parliament has legislative power that such bodies as those above do not possess, it does not have [[legislative initiative]], as most [[National parliaments of the European Union|national EU parliaments]] do<ref name="Parliament's powers"/> However, it does have ''de facto'' capacity for [[legislative initiative]] (see [[#Powers and functions|Powers and functions]] below).<ref name="Pot initative"/> While it is the "first institution" of the European Union (mentioned first in the [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]], having ceremonial precedence over all authority at European level),<ref name="Protocol"/> the Council has greater powers over legislation than the Parliament where [[European Union legislative procedure|codecision procedure]] (equal rights of amendment and rejection) does not apply. It has, however, had control over the [[Budget of the European Union|EU budget]] (minus agriculture) since the 1970s and has a veto over the appointment of the [[European Commission]].<ref name="Parliament's powers"/>

The European Parliament has two meeting places, namely the [[Seat of the European Parliament in Strasbourg|Louise Weiss building]] in [[Strasbourg]], France, which serves for twelve four-day [[plenary session]]s per year and is the official seat, and the [[Espace L<U+00E9>opold]] ({{lang-nl|Leopoldruimte}}) complex in [[Brussels]], Belgium, the larger of the two, which serves for [[Committees of the European Parliament|committee]] meetings, [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political groups]] and complementary plenary sessions. The cost of having all MEPs and their staff moving several times a year from one place to another is of concern to some. The [[Secretariat of the European Parliament]], the Parliament's administrative body, [[European Parliament in Luxembourg|is based in Luxembourg]].<ref name="Consolidated Treaty">{{cite web|title = Consolidated versions of the treaty on European Union and of the treaty establishing the European Community|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)|Eur-lex]]|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref><ref name="Wallstr<U+00F6>m Blog">{{cite web|last = Wallstr<U+00F6>m | first = Margot|authorlink=Margot Wallstr<U+00F6>m|title = My blog: Denmark, Latvia, Strasbourg|date=2006-05-24|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]]|url=http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/wallstrom/denmark_latvia_strasbourg/|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>

The [[President of the European Parliament]] (its [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]]) is currently [[Jerzy Buzek]] ([[European Peoples Party|EPP]]), elected in July 2009. He presides over a multi-party chamber, the two largest groups being the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) and the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]] (S&D). The last Union-wide elections were the [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 Parliamentary Elections]].

==History==
{{see|History of the European Union}}
The Parliament, like the other institutions, was not designed in its current form when it first met on 10 September 1952. One of the oldest common institutions, it began as the "Common Assembly" of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC). It was a consultative assembly of 78 [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarians]] drawn from the national [[parliament]]s of member states (see [[dual mandate]]), having no legislative powers.<ref name="ENA History">{{cite web|title = European Parliament|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3998|accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = EPP-ED Chronology<U+2014>1951<U+2013>1960|publisher=[[European People's Party]]|url=http://www.epp-ed.eu/group/en/chronology02.asp|accessdate = 2007-07-05}}</ref> This change since its foundation was highlighted by Professor David Farrell<!--don't link, not a football player--> of the [[University of Manchester]];<ref name="Farrell Powerful">{{cite web|title = Professor Farrell: "The EP is now one of the most powerful legislatures in the world"|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20070615IPR07837|date=[[2007-06-18]]|accessdate = 2007-07-05}}</ref>
{{cquote|For much of its life, the European Parliament could have been justly labelled a 'multi-lingual talking shop'. But this is no longer the case: the EP is now one of the most powerful legislatures in the world both in terms of its legislative and executive oversight powers.}}

Its development since its foundation is testament to the evolution of the Union's structures without one clear "master plan". Some such as Tom Reid<!--Do not link, Wikipedia Tom Reid is an ice hockey player--> of the [[Washington Post]] said of the Union, "nobody would have deliberately designed a government as complex and as redundant as the EU".<ref>{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Tom|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The United States of Europe|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|year=2004|location=London|pages=272|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=0-141-02317-1}}</ref> Even the Parliament's [[Location of European Union institutions#European Parliament|two seats]], which have switched several times, is a result of various agreements or lack of agreements.<ref name="ENA History"/>

===Consultative assembly===
The body was not mentioned in the original [[Schuman Declaration]], it was assumed or hoped that difficulties with the British would be resolved to allow the Council of Europe's Assembly to perform the task. A separate Assembly was introduced during negotiations on the Treaty as an institution which would counterbalance and monitor the [[Executive (government)|executive]] while providing democratic legitimacy.<ref name="ENA History"/> The wording of the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|ECSC Treaty]] demonstrated the leaders desire for more than a normal consultative assembly by using the term "representatives of the people" and allowed for direct election. Its early importance was highlighted when the Assembly was given the task of drawing up the draft treaty to establish a [[European Political Community]]. In this the "[[Ad Hoc]]" Assembly was established on 13 September 1952<ref name="AEIpolitical_union_draft_treaty_1">[http://aei.pitt.edu/991/01/political_union_draft_treaty_1.pdf Ad Hoc Assembly, Information and Official Documents of the Constitutional Committee, October 1952 to April 1953] from the [[Archive of European Integration]]. Retrieved [[2008-10-29]].</ref> with extra members but after the failure of the proposed [[European Defence Community]] the project was dropped.<ref name="ENA COMP">{{cite web|title = Composition of the European Parliament|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3999 |accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref>

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F023908-0002, Stra<U+00DF>burg, Tagung des Europarates.jpg|thumb|left|The first meeting room of the Common Assembly in Strasbourg]]

Despite this the [[European Economic Community]] and [[Euratom]] were established in 1958 by the [[Treaties of Rome]]. The Common Assembly was shared by all three communities (which had separate [[Executive (government)|executives]]) and it renamed itself the "European Parliamentary Assembly". The three communities [[Merger Treaty|merged]] in 1967 and the body was renamed to the current "European Parliament" in 1962.<ref name="ENA History"/> In 1970 the Parliament was granted power over areas of the [[Budget of the European Union|Community's budget]], which were expanded to the whole budget in 1975.<ref name="ENA Budget">{{cite web|title = Power of the purse of the European Parliament|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=4009 |accessdate = 2007-10-11}}</ref> Under the Rome Treaties, the Parliament should have become elected. However the Council was required to agree a uniform voting system before hand, which it failed to do. The Parliament threatened to take the Council to the [[European Court of Justice]] leading to a compromise whereby the Council would agree to elections, but the issue of voting systems would be put off till a later date.<ref name="Hoskyns">{{cite book| last = Hoskyns | first = Catherine | coauthors = Michael Newman | title = Democratizing the European Union: Issues for the twenty-first Century (Perspectives on Democratization | publisher = [[Manchester University Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0719056666 }}</ref>

[[File:Flag of the European Parliament 1973-1983.svg|thumb|The emblem of Parliament until 1983]]

===Elected Parliament===
In 1979, its members were [[Elections in the European Union|directly elected]] for the [[European Parliament election, 1979|first time]]. This set it apart from similar institutions such as those of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] or [[Pan-African Parliament]] which are appointed.<ref name="ENA History"/><ref>{{cite web|title = Framework|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?Link=/AboutUs/APCE_framework.htm|publisher = [[Council of Europe]]|accessdate = 2007-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title =Overview of the Pan-African Parliament|publisher = [[Pan-African Parliament]]|url=http://www.pan-africanparliament.org/AboutPAP_Overview.aspx|accessdate = 2007-07-05}}</ref> After that first election, the parliament held its first session on 11 July 1979, electing [[Simone Veil]] MEP as its President. Veil was also the first female President of the Parliament since it was formed as the Common Assembly.<ref>{{cite web|title = The history of the European Parliament|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eplive/expert/shotlist_page/20070314SHL04223/default_fr.htm|accessdate = 2007-07-05}}</ref>

As an elected body, the Parliament began to draft proposals addressing the functioning of the Union. For example in 1984, inspired by its previous work on the Political Community, it drafted the "draft Treaty establishing the European Union" (also known as the 'Spinelli Plan' after its rapporteur [[Altiero Spinelli]] MEP). Although it was not adopted, many ideas were later implemented by other treaties.<ref name="ENA TEU">{{cite web|title = The European Parliament's proposals|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=6536 |accessdate = 2007-10-11}}</ref> Furthermore the Parliament began holding votes on proposed [[President of the European Commission|Commission Presidents]] from the 1980s, before it was given any formal right to veto.<ref name="Commission Appointment">{{cite web|last = European Parliament Website|title = Oversight over the Commission and Council|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+PRESS+BI-20041022-1+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|accessdate = 2007-07-01 }}</ref>

[[File:Raadvaneuropa.jpg|thumb|left|Strasbourg hemicycle until 1999]]

Since the election the membership of the European Parliament has simply expanded whenever new nations have joined (the membership was also adjusted upwards in 1994 after [[German reunification]]). Following this the [[Treaty of Nice]] imposed a cap on the number of members to be elected, 732.<ref name="ENA History"/>

Like the other institutions, the Parliament's [[Seat (legal entity)|seat]] was not yet fixed. The provisional arrangements placed Parliament in [[Strasbourg]], while the Commission and Council had their seats in Brussels. In 1985 the Parliament, wishing to be closer to these institutions, built a second chamber in Brussels and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the [[European Council]] in 1992. It stated the Parliament would retain its formal seat in Strasbourg, where twelve sessions a year would be held, but with all other parliamentary activity in Brussels. This two seat arrangement was contested by Parliament but was later enshrined in the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]]. To this day the [[Location of European Union institutions|institution's locations]] are a source of contention.<ref name="ENA seats">{{cite web|first=|title=The seats of the institutions of the European Union|date=|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=20822|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref>

===Recent history===
[[File:Jos<U+00E9> Manuel Barroso MEDEF FULL.jpg|thumb|In 2004, Parliament forced [[President Barroso]] to change his proposed Commission team.]]
The Parliament had been gaining more powers from successive treaties, namely through the extension of [[codecision procedure]],<ref name="ENA legis">{{cite web|first=|title=Power to legislate of the European Parliament|date=|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=4008|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|accessdate=2007-10-11}}</ref> and in 1999, the Parliament forced the resignation of the [[Santer Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|last = Topan|first=Angelina|title = The resignation of the Santer-Commission: the impact of 'trust' and 'reputation' |date=2002-09-30|publisher=European Integration Online Papers|url=http://eiop.or.at/eiop/pdf/2002-014.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> The Parliament had refused to approve the [[Budget of the European Union|Community budget]] over allegations of fraud and mis-management in the Commission. The two main parties took on a government-opposition dynamic for the first time during the crisis which ended in the Commission resigning en masse, the first of any forced resignation, in the face of an impending censure from the Parliament.<ref name="Ringe"/>

In 2004, following the largest trans-national election in history, despite the [[European Council]] choosing a President from the largest political group (the EPP), the Parliament again exerted pressure on the Commission. During the Parliament's hearings of the proposed [[European Commissioner|Commissioners]] MEPs raised doubts about some nominees with the [[Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs|Civil liberties committee]] rejecting [[Rocco Buttiglione]] from the post of [[European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security|Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security]] over his views on [[homosexuality]]. That was the first time the Parliament had ever voted against an incoming Commissioner and despite Barroso's insistence upon Buttiglione the Parliament forced Buttiglione to be withdrawn. A number of other Commissioners also had to be withdrawn or reassigned before Parliament allowed the [[Barroso Commission]] to take office.<ref name="IHT Butt"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Tobais|first=Troll|title =<U+201C>We have to democratise procedures<U+201D>|date=2004-11-02|publisher=Caf<U+00E9> Babel|url=http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=T&Id=2620|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>

In addition to the extension of codecision, the Parliament's democratic mandate has given it greater control over legislation against the other institutions. In voting on the [[Bolkestein directive]] in 2006, the Parliament voted by a large majority for over 400 amendments that changed the fundamental principle of the law. The ''[[Financial Times]]'' described it in the following terms:<ref name="FT CIO">{{cite web|title = How the European parliament got serious|date=2006-02-23|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/56b6d760-a412-11da-83cc-0000779e2340.html|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>
{{cquote|The European parliament has suddenly come into its own. It marks another shift in power between the three central EU institutions. Last week's vote suggests that the directly elected MEPs, in spite of their multitude of ideological, national and historical allegiances, have started to coalesce as a serious and effective EU institution, just as enlargement has greatly complicated negotiations inside both the Council and Commission.}}

In 2007, for the first time, [[European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security|Justice Commissioner]] [[Franco Frattini]] included Parliament in talks on the second [[Schengen Information System]] even though MEPs only needed to be consulted on parts of the package. After that experiment, Frattini indicated he would like to include Parliament in all justice and criminal matters, informally pre-empting the new powers they could gain as part of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]].<ref name="Frattini 2009">{{cite web|last = Beunderman |first=Mark|title = Frattini seeks to apply new EU treaty rules before 2009|publisher=EU Observer|date=2007-11-09|url=http://euobserver.com/9/25117|accessdate = 2007-11-09 }}</ref>

==Powers and functions==
[[File:EP Strasbourg hemicycle l-gal.jpg|thumb|The Parliament's hemicycle (debating chamber) in Strasbourg]]
The Parliament and Council are essentially two chambers in the [[bicameral]] [[legislative branch]] of the European Union, with legislative power being officially distributed equally between both [[Chambers of parliament|chambers]]. However there are some differences from [[National parliaments of the European Union|national legislatures]]; for example, neither the Parliament nor the Council have the power of [[legislative initiative]] (except for the fact that the Council has the power in some [[intergovernmental]] matters). In [[European Community|Community matters]], this is a power uniquely reserved for the European Commission (the [[Executive (government)|executive]]). Meaning that while Parliament can amend and reject [[legislation]], to make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] before anything can become [[law]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Fact Sheets 1.3.8 The Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/1_3_8_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-14 }}</ref> However, the value of such a power is questioned, noting that only 15% of such initiatives in national parliaments become law due to the lack of executive support.<ref name="Kreppel">{{cite web|first= Amie|last= Kreppel|title = Understanding the European Parliament from a Federalist Perspective: The Legislatures of the USA and EU Compared|publisher=Center for European Studies, [[University of Florida]]|year=2006|url=http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/kreppel/COMFEDFINAL.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2008-09-26}}</ref> Yet it has been argued by former [[President of the European Parliament|Parliament President]] [[Hans-Gert P<U+00F6>ttering]] that as the Parliament does have the right to ask the Commission to draft such legislation, and as the Commission is following Parliament's proposals more and more Parliament does have a ''[[de facto]]'' right of legislative initiative.<ref name="Pot initative">{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Matt|date=2008-06-24|title = P<U+00F6>ttering defends parliament's role at EU summits|publisher=The Parliament Magazine|url=http://www.theparliament.com/latestnews/news-article/newsarticle/poettering-defends-parliaments-role-at-eu-summits/|accessdate = 2008-06-25 }}</ref>

The Parliament also has a great deal of indirect influence, through [[European Union law#Institutional acts|non-binding resolutions]] and [[Committees of the European Parliament|committee hearings]], as a "pan-European [[soapbox]]" with the ear of [[Brussels and the European Union#Centre of activity|thousands of Brussels-based journalists]]. There is also an indirect effect on [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|foreign policy]]; the Parliament must approve all development grants, including those overseas. For example, the support for [[Iraq War|post-war Iraq]] reconstruction, or incentives for the cessation of [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iranian nuclear development]], must be supported by the Parliament. Parliamentary support was also required for the [[transatlantic]] passenger data-sharing deal with the [[United States]].<ref name="Rockwell">{{cite book | last = Schnabel | first = Rockwell | coauthors = Francis Rocca | title = The Next Superpower?: the Rise of Europe and its Challenge to the United States | publisher = [[Rowman & Littlefield]] Publishers | year = 2005 | location = Oxford | pages = 111 | isbn = 978-0742545489 }}</ref>

===Legislative procedure===
With each new treaty, the powers of the Parliament have expanded. Its powers have been primarily defined through the [[European Union legislative procedure|Union's legislative procedures]]. The method which has slowly become the dominant procedure (about three-quarters of policy areas) is the [[Codecision procedure]], where powers are essentially equal between Parliament and Council.<ref name="Parliament's powers"/> Codecision provides an equal footing between the two bodies. Under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council. They then send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a "common position". That proposal may either be approved or further amendments may be tabled by the Parliament. If the Council does not approve these, then a "Conciliation Committee" is formed. The Committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a common position. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament, again by an [[absolute majority]].<ref name="Parliament's powers">{{cite web|title = Parliament's powers and procedures|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&id=46|accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref><ref name="decision making">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Decision-making in the European Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://www.europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref> This is also aided by Parliament's mandate as the only directly democratic institution, which has given it leeway to have greater control over legislation than other institutions, for example over its changes to the Bolkestein directive in 2006.<ref name="FT CIO"/>

Other procedures include: [[Cooperation procedure|Cooperation]], meaning the Council can overrule the Parliament if it is unanimous; [[Consultation procedure|Consultation]], which require just consultation of the Parliament; and [[Assent procedure]], where the Parliament has a veto. The Commission and Council, or just Commission, can also act completely independently of the Parliament, but the use of these procedures are very limited. The procedure also depends upon which type of [[European Union law#Institutional acts|institutional act]] is being used.<ref name="Parliament's powers"/> The strongest act is a [[Regulation (European Union)|regulation]], an [[Act of Parliament|act]] or [[Statutory law|law]] which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are [[Directive (European Union)|directives]] which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve. They do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A [[European Union decision|decision]] is an instrument which is focused at a particular person/group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue [[European Union recommendation|recommendations and opinions]] which are merely non-binding, declarations.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Community legal instruments|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/community_legal_instruments_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref> There is a further document which does not follow normal procedures, this is a "written declaration" which is similar to an [[early day motion]] used in the [[Westminster system]]. It is a document proposed by up to five MEPs on a matter within the EU's activities used to launch a debate on that subject. Having been posted outside the entrance to the hemicycle, members can sign the declaration and if a majority do so it is forwarded to the President and announced to the plenary before being forwarded to the other institutions and formally noted in the minutes.<ref name="EP WD">{{cite web|title = Written declarations|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/plenary/writtenDecl.do|accessdate = 2007-11-01}}</ref>

===Budget===
The legislative branch officially holds the Union's budgetary authority, powers gained through the [[Budgetary treaties of the European Communities|Budgetary Treaties]] of the 1970s. The [[European Union Budget|EU's budget]] is divided into compulsory and non-compulsory spending. Compulsory spending is that resulting from [[Treaties of the European Union|EU treaties]] (including [[Common Agricultural Policy|agriculture]]) and international agreements; the rest is non-compulsory. While the Council has the last word on compulsory spending, the Parliament has the last word on non-compulsory spending.<ref name="budgetary power">{{cite web|title = Budgetary power|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&pageRank=5&language=EN|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref><ref name="budget decided">{{cite web|title = How is the budget decided?|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/budget/budget_glance/how_decided_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>

The institutions draw up budget estimates and the Commission consolidates them into a draft budget. Both the Council and the Parliament can amend the budget with the Parliament adopting or rejecting the budget at its second reading. The signature of the Parliament's president is required before the budget becomes law.<ref name="budgetary power"/><ref name="budget decided"/>

The Parliament is also responsible for discharging the implementation of previous budgets, on the basis of the annual report of the [[European Court of Auditors]]. It has refused to approve the budget only twice, in 1984 and in 1998. On the latter occasion it led to the resignation of the [[Santer Commission]].<ref name="Hoskyns"/><ref name="budget background">{{cite web | title=Budgetary control: 1996 discharge raises issue of confidence in the Commission  | publisher =[[Europa (web portal)]]| year=1999  | url =http://www.europarl.europa.eu/election/bilan/en/pf1901en.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-15 }}</ref>

===Control of the executive===
Unlike most EU states, which usually operate [[parliamentary system]]s, there is a [[separation of powers]] between the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and legislative which makes the European Parliament more akin to the [[United States Congress]] than an EU state legislature.<ref name="Kreppel"/> The [[President of the European Commission]] is proposed by the Council (in practice by the [[European Council]]) and that proposal has to be approved by the Parliament (by a simple majority), essentially giving the Parliament a veto, but not a right to propose, the head of the executive. Following the approval of the Commission President, the members of the Commission are proposed by the President in accord with the member-states. Each Commissioner comes before a relevant parliamentary committee hearing covering the proposed portfolio. They are then, as a body, approved or rejected by the Parliament.<ref name="Commission Oversight">{{cite web|title = Oversight over the Commission and Council|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&pageRank=9&language=EN|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref><ref name="Commission Appointment">{{cite web|title = Background Information: Election of the European Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+PRESS+BI-20041022-1+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|accessdate = 2007-07-01 }}</ref> In practice, the Parliament has never voted against a President or his Commission, but it did seem likely when the Barroso Commission was put forward. The resulting pressure forced the proposal to be withdrawn and changed to be more acceptable to parliament.<ref name="IHT Butt">{{cite web|last =Bowley|first=Graham|title =Buttiglione affair highlights evolving role of Parliament : Questions arise on democracy at the EU| publisher =[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=2004-10-18|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/18/brussels_ed3_.php|accessdate = 2007-07-01}}</ref> That pressure was seen as an important sign by some of the evolving nature of the Parliament and its ability to make the Commission accountable, rather than being a rubber stamp for candidates. Furthermore, in voting on the Commission, MEPs also voted along party lines, rather than national lines, despite frequent pressure from national governments on their MEPs. This cohesion and willingness to use the Parliament's power ensured greater attention from national leaders, other institutions and the public<U+2014>who previously gave the lowest ever turnout for the Parliament's elections.<ref>{{cite web|last =Murray|first=Alasdair|title =Three cheers for EU democracy| publisher =[[Centre for European Reform]]|year=2004|url=http://www.cer.org.uk/articles/39_murray.html|accessdate = 2007-07-07}}</ref>

The Parliament also has the power to [[censure]] the Commission if they have a two-thirds majority which will force the resignation of the entire Commission from office. As with approval, this power has never been used but it was threatened to the [[Santer Commission]], who subsequently [[Santer Commission#Resignation|resigned of their own accord]]. There are a few other controls, such as: the requirement of Commission to submit reports to the Parliament and answer questions from MEPs; the requirement of the President-in-office of the [[European Council]] to present their programme at the start of their [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|presidency]]; the right of MEPs to make proposals for legislation and policy to the Commission and Council; and the right to question members of those institutions (e.g. "Commission [[Question Time]]" every Tuesday).<ref name="Commission Appointment"/><ref name="Commission Oversight"/> At present, MEPs may ask a question on any topic whatsoever, but in July 2008 MEPs voted to limit questions to those within the EU's mandate and ban offensive or personal questions.<ref name="EUO rise">{{cite web|last=Mahony|first=Honor|title=New rules to make it harder for MEPs to form political groups|url=http://euobserver.com/9/26468|date=[[2008-07-09]]|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|accessdate=2008-07-10}}</ref>

===Supervisory powers===
The Parliament also has other powers of general supervision, mainly granted by the [[Maastricht Treaty]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Maastricht Treaty 15 years on: birth of the "European Union"|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|date=2007-02-07|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/story_page/008-2784-036-02-06-901-20070206STO02783-2007-05-02-2007/default_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-07-06}}</ref> The Parliament has the power to set up a Committee of Inquiry, for example over mad cow disease or CIA detention flights<U+2014>the former led to the creation of the [[European Medicines Agency|European veterinary agency]]. The Parliament can call other institutions to answer questions and if necessary to take them to [[Court of Justice of the European Communities|court]] if they break EU law or treaties.<ref name="supervisory">{{cite web|title = Supervisory power|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&pageRank=8&language=EN|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> Furthermore it has powers over the appointment of the members of the [[Court of Auditors]]<ref>{{cite web|title =Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament. Rule 101: Appointment of the Members of the Court of Auditors|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20070101+RULE-101+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN&navigationBar=YES|accessdate = 2007-07-07}}</ref> and the president and executive board of the [[European Central Bank]]. The [[List of Presidents of the European Central Bank|ECB president]] is also obliged to present an annual report to the parliament.<ref name="supervisory"/>

The [[European Ombudsman]] is elected by the Parliament, who deals with public complaints against all institutions.<ref name="supervisory"/> Petitions can also be brought forward by any [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizen]] on a matter within the EU's sphere of activities. The [[Committee on Petitions]] hears cases, some 1500 each year, sometimes presented by the citizen themselves at the Parliament. While the Parliament attempts to resolve the issue as a mediator they do resort to legal proceedings if it is necessary to resolve the citizens dispute.<ref name="petitions">{{cite web|last=Rickards|first=Mark|title = MEPs get taste of people power|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2007-11-03|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7075573.stm|accessdate = 2007-11-03 }}</ref>

==Members==
{{main|Member of the European Parliament}}
{{National apportionment of MEPs}}
The [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarians]] are known in [[English language|English]] as Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). They are elected every 5 years by [[universal suffrage|universal adult suffrage]] and sit according to political allegiance; about a third are women. Prior to 1979 they were appointed by their national parliaments.<ref name="ENA composition">{{cite web|title = Composition of the European Parliament|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3999 |accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref><ref name="EP Members">{{cite web|title = Members|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=45&pageRank=3 |accessdate = 2007-10-27}}</ref>

As [[Apportionment in the European Parliament|states are allocated seats]] according to population, the maximum number of MEPs is 736. However, enlargements may lead to this number being exceeded until the following election, for example between 2007 and 2009 due to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria<ref name="ENA composition"/><ref>{{cite web|title = Parliament all set for enlargement|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/highlights/en/302.html|accessdate = 2007-06-14 }}</ref> however the rules are due to be changed under the Treaty of Lisbon. Under Lisbon, there would be 751 members (however, as the President cannot vote while in the chair there would only be 750 voting members at any one time).<ref name="EUO Lisbon">{{cite web|last=Goldirova|first=Renata|title =EU agrees new 'Treaty of Lisbon'|date=2007-10-19|publisher=EU Observer|url=http://euobserver.com/9/25001|accessdate = 2007-11-19}}</ref> In addition, the maximum number of seats allocated to a state would be lowered to ninety-six, from the current ninety-nine, and the minimum number of seats would be raised to six, from the current five. These seats are distributed according to "[[degressive proportionality]]", meaning that the larger the state, the more citizens that are represented per MEP. It is intended that the new system, including revising the seating well in advance of elections, can avoid political [[horse trading (political)|horse trading]] when the numbers have to be revised.<ref>{{cite web|title = Distribution of EP seats: Constitutional Affairs Committee approvals proposal|date=2007-10-02|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/001-11037-274-10-40-901-20071001IPR11035-01-10-2007-2007-false/default_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-10-07}}</ref>

At present, members receive the same salary as members of their national parliament. However as of 2009 a new members statute will come into force which gives all members an equal monthly pay of 7,000 [[euro]] each, subject to a community [[tax]] and can also be taxed nationally. MEPs would [[Retirement|retire]] at 63 and receive the whole of their [[pension]] from the Parliament. Travelling expenses would also be given based on actual cost rather than a flat rate as is the case now.<ref name="Glossary Statute">{{cite web|title = Statute for Members of the European Parliament|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/mep_status_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-10-27}}</ref> In addition to their pay, members are granted a number of privileges and [[Diplomatic immunity|immunities]]. To ensure their free movement to and from the Parliament, they are accorded by their own states the facilities accorded to senior [[official]]s travelling abroad and by other state governments the facilities of visiting [[Diplomat#Diplomats and diplomatic missions|foreign representative]]s. When in their own state they have all the immunities accorded to national parliamentarians, and in other states they have immunity from [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]] and [[Criminal procedure|legal proceedings]]. However immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found committing a criminal offence and the Parliament also has the right to strip a member of their immunity.<ref name="LEX Prot">{{cite web|title = 7.

===Political groups===
{{main|Political groups of the European Parliament}}{{clr}}
{{Political groups of the European Parliament (7th)}}
MEPs in Parliament are organised into seven different [[parliamentary group]]s, including over thirty non-attached members known as ''[[non-inscrits]]''. The two largest groups are the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) and the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Socialists & Democrats]] (S&D). These two groups have dominated the Parliament for much of its life, continuously holding between 50 and 70 percent of the seats together. No single group has ever held a majority in Parliament.<ref name="Kreppel">{{cite web|last = Kreppel|first=Amie|title = The European Parliament and Supranational Party System|publisher =[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2002|url=http://193.60.94.203/97805218/06251/sample/9780521806251ws.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> As a result of being broad alliances of national parties, European groups parties are very decentralised and hence have more in common with parties in the United States than EU states.<ref name="Kreppel"/>

Groups are often based around a single [[European political party]] such as the [[Party of European Socialists|socialist group]] (prior to 2009). However they can, like the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe|liberal group]], include more than one European party as well as national parties and independents.<ref>{{cite web|title = Party Politics in the EU|publisher = civitas.org.uk|url=http://www.civitas.org.uk/eufacts/download/CIT.3.EU%20Political%20Parties.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> For a group to be recognised, it needs 25 MEPs from seven different countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=European Parliament increases threshold to form a political group|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/009-33698-189-07-28-901-20080708IPR33697-07-07-2008-2008-false/default_en.htm|date=[[2008-07-09]]|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|accessdate=2008-07-10}}</ref> Once recognised groups receive financial subsidies from the parliament and guaranteed seats on Committees, creating an incentive for the formation of groups.

===Grand coalition===
Given that the Parliament does not form the government in the traditional sense of a Parliamentary system, its politics have developed along more consensual lines rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions. Indeed for much of its life it has been dominated by a [[grand coalition]] of the People's Party and Socialist Party. The two major parties tend to co-operate to find a compromise between their two groups leading to proposals endorsed by huge majorities.<ref>{{cite web|last=Settembri|first=Pierpaolo|title = Is the European Parliament competitive or consensual ... "and why bother"?|url=http://www.fedtrust.co.uk/admin/uploads/FedT_workshop_Settembri.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Federal Trust|date=2007-02-02|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> However there have been some occasions where real party politics have emerged, for example over the [[Santer Commission#Budget controversy|resignation of the Santer Commission]];<ref name = "Ringe"/>

When the initial allegations against the Commission emerged, they were directed primarily against [[<U+00C9>dith Cresson]] and [[Manuel Mar<U+00ED>n]], both socialist members. When the parliament was considering refusing to discharge the [[Budget of the European Union|Community budget]], [[President of the European Commission|President]] [[Jacques Santer]] stated that a no vote would be tantamount to a [[vote of no confidence]]. The Socialist group supported the Commission and saw the issue as an attempt by the EPP to discredit their party ahead of the 1999 elections. Socialist leader, [[Pauline Green]] MEP, attempted a vote of confidence and the EPP put forward counter motions. During this period the two parties took on similar roles to a [[government]]-[[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] dynamic, with the Socialists supporting the executive and EPP renouncing its previous coalition support and voting it down.<ref name="Ringe"/> Politicisation such as this has been increasing, in 2007 Simon Hix of the [[London School of Economics]] noted that;<ref name="Farrell Powerful"/>
{{cquote|Our work also shows that politics in the European Parliament is becoming increasingly based around party and ideology. Voting is increasingly split along left-right lines, and the cohesion of the party groups has risen dramatically, particularly in the fourth and fifth parliaments. So there are likely to be policy implications here too.}}

During the fifth term, 1999 to 2004, there was a break in the grand coalition resulting in a centre-right coalition between the Liberal and People's parties.<ref name="Watson interview">{{cite web|title = Interview: Graham Watson, leader of group of Liberal Democrat MEPs |url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/elections/interview-graham-watson-leader-group-liberal-democrat-meps/article-128543|publisher=Euractiv|date=[[2004-06-15]]|accessdate=2007-11-01}}</ref> This was reflected in the Presidency of the Parliament with the terms being shared between the EPP and the ELDR, rather than the EPP and Socialists.<ref>{{cite web|title = European Parliament elects new president |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/398892.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=1999-07-20|accessdate=2007-11-01}}</ref> In the following term the liberal group grew to hold 88 seats, the largest number of seats held by any third party in Parliament.<ref name="ALDE formed">{{cite web|title=The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is born|date=2004-07-14|publisher=Graham Watson MEP website|url=http://www.grahamwatsonmep.org/news/000017/the_alliance_of_liberals_and_democrats_for_europe_is_born.html|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref>

Elections have taken place, directly in every member-state, every five years since 1979. As of 2009 there have been seven. Occasionally, when a nation joins mid-term, a [[by-election]] will be held to elect their representatives. This has happened four times, most recently when Romania and Bulgaria joined in 2007 (see below). Elections take place across several days according to local custom and, aside from having to be proportional, the [[electoral system]] is chosen by the member-state. This includes allocation of [[European Parliament constituency|sub-national constituencies]]; while most members have a national list, some, like the UK and France, divide their allocation between regions. Seats are allocated to member-states according to their population, with no state having more than 99, but no fewer than 5, in order to maintain proportionality.<ref>{{cite web|title = The European Parliament: electoral procedures|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/facts/1_3_4_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>

The most recent Union-wide elections to the European Parliament were the [[European Parliament election, 2009|European elections of 2009]], held in June of that year. They were the largest simultaneous transnational elections ever held anywhere in the world, since nearly 380 million citizens were eligible to vote. The proportion of MEPs elected in 2004 who were female was 30.2%; in 1979 it was just 16.5%. There are a number of proposals to "dress up" the elections to attract greater public attention to them. These include most notably the idea of linking them more closely to the Commission presidency. This would be by having political parties running with candidates for the job, so the largest party would essentially be forming the government, as in the [[parliamentary system]] of government.<ref>{{cite web|last=Spongenberg|first=Helena|title=EU wants to dress up 2009 elections on TV|date=2007-02-26|publisher=EU Observer|url=http://www.euobserver.com/9/23566|accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref><ref name="Palmer">{{cite web|last = Palmer|first=John|title = Size shouldn't matter|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2007-01-10|url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/john_palmer/2007/01/good_rather_than_bad_not_b_ig.html|accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}</ref><ref name="EUO Political">{{cite web|last = Mahony |first=Honor|title = European politics to get more political|publisher=EU Observer|date=2007-06-27|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24370|accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}</ref> This was attempted in 2004, however only the [[European Green Party]], which was the first true pan-European party to be established with a common campaign,<ref name="Green First">{{cite web|title =European Greens Found European Greens|date=2004-02-23|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1119463,00.html|format=|accessdate = 2008-01-30 }}</ref> proposed a candidate for the post of President: [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]].<ref name="Epin">{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Kirsty|title =Nearing Compromise as Convention goes into Final Week?|publisher=EPIN|url=http://www.epin.org/pdf/comment_Hughes2_june03.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2008-01-30 }}</ref> Meanwhile, the closest any other party had come in that election was when the People's Party mentioned four or five people they'd like to be President.<ref name = "Euractiv elect deficit"/> In 2009, the incumbent President Barroso was formally nominated by the EPP, yet the Socialists were unable to agree on a candidate; in party due to national socialist leaders backing Barroso leading to their only being one declared candidate (whose party formed the largest group regardless).<ref>{{cite web|title =Socialists agree to disagree on Barroso|date=2009-06-19|publisher=EurActiv|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/future-eu/socialists-agree-disagree-barroso/article-183319|format=|accessdate = 2009-07-14 }}</ref>

==Proceedings==
[[File:2007 07 16 parlament europejski bruksela 40.JPG|thumb|right|The hemicycle in Brussels]]
Each year the activities of the Parliament cycle between committee weeks where reports are discussed in committees and interparliamentary delegations meet, political group weeks for members to discuss work within their political groups and session weeks where members spend 3<U+00BD> days in [[Strasbourg]] for part-sessions. In addition six 2-day part-sessions are organised in [[Brussels]] throughout the year. Four weeks are allocated as constituency week to allow members to do exclusively constituency work. Finally there are no meetings planned during the summer weeks.<ref>{{cite web|title = European Parliament 2007 calendar of activities|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/general/cal2007.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> The Parliament has the power to meet without being convened by another authority. Its meetings are partly controlled by the treaties but are otherwise up to Parliament according to its own "Rules of Procedure" (the regulations governing the parliament).<ref>{{cite web|title = Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament.

During sessions, members may speak after being called on by the President, with a time limit of one minute. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates.<ref>{{cite web|title = Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament.

That is when each MEP in turn is called by name, in alphabetical order, to state their support or opposition: it is only used for certain important votes or when a political group of approximately one fifth of all MEPs requests it, but the number of roll-call votes has increased with time. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example when the President is elected).<ref>{{cite web|title = How do MEPs vote?|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20060628STO09319&secondRef=0|date=[[2006-06-28]]|accessdate = 2007-07-06 }}</ref><ref>Hix &amp;al (see [[#Further reading|further reading]] below), <U+00A7>1.4 ("The dataset: roll-call votes in the European Parliament"), p.29<U+2013>30.</ref> All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the [[Official Journal of the European Union]] and can be accessed online.<ref>{{cite web|title = The different types of document available on Europarl|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/guide/search/docsearch_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-07-07 }}</ref>

Members are arranged in a [[Hemicycle (chamber)|hemicycle]] according to their political groups who are ordered mainly by left to right, but some smaller groups are placed towards the outer ring of the Parliament. All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for translation and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the groups sit on the front benches at the centre, and in the very centre is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining half of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff sit. Further benches are provided between the sides of this area and the MEPs, these are taken up by the Council on the far left and the Commission on the far right. Both the Brussels and Strasbourg hemicycle roughly follow this layout with only minor differences.<ref>{{cite web|title = Brussels seating plan|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sce/data/fast_access/doc//PLAN_BRX_30%20JAN_2008.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> With access to the chamber limited, entrance is controlled by ushers who aid MEPs in the chamber (for example in delivering documents). The ushers also act as a form of police in enforcing the President, for example in ejecting an MEP who is disrupting the session (although this is rare). The first head of protocol in the Parliament was French, so many of the duties in the Parliament are based on the French model first developed following the [[French Revolution]]. The 180 ushers are highly visible in the Parliament, dressed in black [[Tailcoat|tails]] and wearing a silver chain, and are recruited in the same manner as the [[EPSO|European civil service]]. The President is allocated a personal usher.<ref>{{cite web|title = The European Parliament Ushers|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20051017FCS01532&secondRef=0|accessdate = 2007-06-21 }}</ref>

===President and organisation===
{{main|President of the European Parliament}}
[[File:Jerzy Buzek.jpg|thumb|President [[Jerzy Buzek]], the first President of an EU institution to come from Eastern Europe.]]
The President, currently [[Jerzy Buzek]] MEP of the EPP, is essentially the [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]] of the Parliament. He or she presides over the plenary when it is in session and the President's signature is required for all acts adopted by co-decision, including the EU budget. The President is also responsible for representing the Parliament externally, including in legal matters, and for the application of the rules of procedure. He or she is elected for two-and-a-half-year terms, meaning two elections per parliamentary term.<ref>{{cite web|title = Duties of the President|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20040720+RULE-019+DOC+XML+V0//EN&navigationBar=YES|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Functions|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/defaulten_mac.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-15 }}</ref>

In most countries, the protocol of the [[head of state]] comes before all others, however in the EU the Parliament is listed as the first institution, and hence the protocol of its President comes before any other European, or national, protocol. The gifts given to numerous visiting dignitaries depends upon the President. President [[Josep Borrell]] MEP of Spain gave his counterparts a crystal cup created by an artist from Barcelona which had engraved upon it parts of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]] among other things.<ref name="Protocol">{{cite web|title = Parliament's Protocol Service |date=2006-07-28|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20060728FCS09980&secondRef=0|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|accessdate = 2007-10-28 }}</ref>

A number of notable figures have been President of the Parliament and its predecessors. The first President was [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] MEP<ref>Though the history of Parliament sometimes excludes the early Common Assembly, so the first President would be [[Robert Schuman]] (another founding father) in those circumstances.</ref>, one of the [[Founding fathers of the European Union|founding fathers of the Union]]. Other founding fathers include [[Alcide de Gasperi]] MEP and [[Robert Schuman]] MEP. The two female Presidents were [[Simone Veil]] MEP in 1979 (first President of the elected Parliament) and [[Nicole Fontaine]] MEP in 1999, both Frenchwomen.<ref>{{cite web|title = Former E.P.

During the election of a President, the previous President (or, if unable to, one of the previous Vice-Presidents) presides over the chamber.<ref name="LeP">{{cite web|title=MEPs move to deny extremist Jean-Marie Le Pen platform

Below the President, there are 14 [[President of the European Parliament#Vice-Presidents|Vice-Presidents]] who chair debates when the President is not in the chamber. There are a number of other bodies and posts responsible for the running of parliament besides these speakers. The two main bodies are the [[Bureau (European Parliament)|Bureau]], which is responsible for budgetary and administration issues, and the [[Conference of Presidents]] which is a governing body composed of the presidents of each of the parliament's political groups. Looking after the financial and administrative interests of members are six [[Quaestor (European Parliament)|Quaestors]].

===Committees and delegations===
{{main|Committees of the European Parliament}}
[[File:EuroparliamentCROPPED.jpg|thumb|Parliament building in Brussels, where the committees meet]]
The Parliament has 20 [[Standing Committee]]s consisting of 28 to 86 MEPs each (reflecting the political makeup of the whole Parliament) including a [[Chair (official)|chair]], a bureau and secretariat. They meet twice a month in public to draw up, amend to adopt legislative proposals and reports to be presented to the plenary.<ref name="Organised">{{cite web|title = How the Parliament is Organised|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&id=45|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> The [[rapporteur]]s for a committee are supposed to present the view of the committee, although notably this has not always been the case. In the events leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission, the rapporteur went against the [[Committee on Budgetary Control|Budgetary Control Committee's]] narrow vote to discharge the budget, and urged the Parliament to reject it.<ref name="Ringe">{{cite web  | last =Ringer  | first =Nils F.  | title =The Santer Commission Resignation Crisis  | publisher =[[University of Pittsburgh]]  | month =February | year =2003  | url =http://aei.pitt.edu/2919/01/156.pdf  | format =PDF  | accessdate = 2007-10-07 }}</ref>

Committees can also set up sub-committees (e.g. the [[Subcommittee on Human Rights]]) and temporary committees to deal with a specific topic (e.g. on [[extraordinary rendition]]). The chairs of the Committees co-ordinate their work through the "[[Committees of the European Parliament#Conference Chairmen|Conference of Committee Chairmen]]".<ref name="Organised"/> When co-decision was introduced it increased the Parliaments powers in a number of areas, but most notably those covered by the [[Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety]]. Previously this committee was considered by MEPs as a "[[Cinderella]] committee", however as it gained a new importance, it became more professional and rigorous attracting more and more attention to its work.<ref name="Hoskyns"/>

[[File:Committee Room of the European Parliament in Brussels.jpg|thumb|left|A Committee room in the Parliament]]

The nature of the committees differ from their national counterparts as, although smaller in comparison to those of the [[United States Congressional committee|United States Congress]], the European Parliament's committees are unusually large by European standards with between eight and twelve dedicated members of staff and three to four support staff. Considerable administration, archives and research resources are also at the disposal of the whole Parliament when needed.<ref name="Kreppel"/>

[[Committees of the European Parliament#Delegations|Delegations of the Parliament]] are formed in a similar manner and are responsible for relations with Parliaments outside the EU. There are 34 delegations made up of around 15 MEPs, chairpersons of the delegations also cooperate in a conference like the committee chairs do. They include "Interparliamentary delegations" (maintain relations with Parliament outside the EU), "joint parliamentary committees" (maintaining relations with parliaments of states which are candidates or associates of the EU), the  delegation to the [[ACP EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly]] and the delegation to the [[Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly]].<ref name="Organised"/> MEPs also participate in other international activities such as the [[Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly]], the [[Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue]] and through [[Election monitoring|election observation]] in third countries.<ref>{{cite web|title =European Parliament: In Detail|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/expert.do?language=EN|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|accessdate = 2007-07-09 }}</ref>

===Translation and interpreting===
[[File:2007 07 16 parlament europejski bruksela 47.JPG|thumb|Interpreting booths in the hemicycle simultaneously translate debates between 23 languages]]
Speakers in the European Parliament are entitled to speak in any of the [[Languages of the European Union|EU's 23 official languages]], ranging from [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] to [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Simultaneous interpreting is offered in all plenary sessions, and all final texts of legislation are translated. With twenty-three languages, the European Parliament is the most multilingual parliament in the world<ref>{{cite web|title = Press Release: Irish language arrives in European Parliament|date=2007-01-11|publisher=European Parliament Irish Office|url=http://www.europarl.ie/news_press_release_2_2007.html|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> and the biggest employer of interpreters in the world (employing 350 full time and 400 free-lancers when there is higher demand).<ref name="Interpreters">{{cite web|title = The European Parliament's Interpreters.|date=2006-04-12|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20060403FCS06935&secondRef=0|accessdate = 2007-06-21}}</ref> Citizens may also address the Parliament in [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Catalan language|Catalan/Valencian]] and [[Galician language|Galician]].<ref>{{cite web|title = The European Parliament allows the written communication of citizens in Basques in Basque, Catalan and Galician.|year=2006|publisher=Ciemen|url=http://www.ciemen.org/mercator/notidetail.cfm?IDA=897&lg=gb|accessdate = 2007-06-21}}</ref>

Usually a language is translated from a foreign tongue into a translator's native tongue. Due to the large number of languages, some being minor ones, since 1995 translation is sometimes done the opposite way, out of a translator's native tongue (the "retour" system). In addition, a speech in a minor language may be translated via a third language for lack of interpreters ("relay" interpreting)&nbsp;<U+2014>for example, when translating [[Estonian language|Estonian]] into [[Maltese language|Maltese]].<ref name="Interpreters"/> Interpreters need to be proficient in two other Union languages besides their native language. Due to the complexity of the issues, translation is not word for word. Instead, interpreters have to convey the political meaning of a speech, regardless of their own views. This requires detailed understanding of the politics and terms of the Parliament, involving a great deal of preparation beforehand (e.g. reading the documents in question). Difficulty can often arise when MEPs use colourful language, jokes and word play or speak too fast.<ref name="Interpreters"/>

While some see speaking their native language as an important part of their identity, and can speak more fluently in debates, the translation and the cost of it has been criticised by some. A 2006 report by [[Alexander Stubb]] MEP highlighted that by only using [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]] costs could be reduced from [[Euro|<U+20AC>]]118,000 per day (for 21 languages then<U+2014>[[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] having not yet been included) to <U+20AC>8,900 per day.<ref>{{cite web|title = In European Parliament, debate<U+2014>in 21 languages<U+2014>can be pricey|date=2006-09-12|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0912/p05s01-woeu.html|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> Although many see the ideal single language as being English due to its widespread usage, there is a campaign to make French the single tongue for all legal texts, due to the view that it is more clear and precise for legal purposes. Although this would not directly affect translation in the plenary, it would shift the balance towards French when discussing draft legislation.<ref>{{cite web|title = Campaign to make French sole legal language in EU|date=2007-02-07|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/07/europe/EU-GEN-EU-French.php|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>

==Seat==
{{see|Location of European Union institutions|Espace L<U+00E9>opold|Seat of the European Parliament in Strasbourg}}
[[File:Institutions europeennes IMG 4307.jpg|thumb|The cost of two seats has been a cause of controversy (the Strasbourg building)]]
The Parliament is based in three different cities with numerous buildings. A protocol attached to the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] requires that 12 plenary sessions be held in [[Strasbourg]] (none in August but two in September), which is the Parliament's official seat, while extra part sessions as well as committee meetings are held in [[Brussels]]. [[Luxembourg]] [[European Parliament in Luxembourg|hosts the]] [[Secretariat of the European Parliament]].<ref name="Consolidated Treaty"/> The European Parliament is the only assembly in the world with more than one meeting place and also one of the few that cannot decide its own location.<ref name="Strange">{{cite web|last=Alvaro|first=Alexander|title=Europe's strangest migrants|date=2006-07-06|publisher=Caf<U+00E9> Babel|url=http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=A&Id=1906|accessdate=2007-11-01}}</ref>

The Strasbourg seat is seen as a symbol of reconciliation between France and Germany, the  Strasbourg region having been fought over by the two countries in the past. However it is questioned over the cost of having two seats for the parliament. While Strasbourg is the official seat, and sits alongside the [[Council of Europe]] (with which the "mutual cooperation" is being continuously "fostered"),<ref>{{cite web|title = The Council of Europe and the European Union sign an agreement to foster mutual cooperation|date=2007-05-23|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=PR331(2007)&Language=lanEnglish&Ver=original&BackColorInternet=F5CA75&BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&BackColorLogged=A9BACE&ShowBanner=no&Target=_self|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> [[Brussels and the European Union|Brussels is home to nearly all other major EU institutions]], with the majority of Parliament's work already being carried out there.

Critics have described the two-seat arrangement as a "travelling circus",<ref name="Seat Green">{{cite web|first=|title=Greens condemn EU parliament's 'traveling circus'|date=2007-04-26|url=http://www.4ecotips.com/eco/article_show.php?aid=1222&id=280|publisher=4ecotips|accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref> and there is a strong movement to establish Brussels as the sole seat. This is due to the fact that the other political institutions (the Commission, Council and European Council) are located there, and hence Brussels is treated as the '[[Capital (political)|capital]]' of the EU. This movement has received strong backing through numerous figures, including the Commission First-Vice President who stated that "something that was once a very positive symbol of the EU reuniting France and Germany has now become a negative symbol<U+2014>of wasting money, bureaucracy and the insanity of the Brussels institutions".<ref name="Wallstr<U+00F6>m Blog"/> The [[European Green Party|Green party]] has also noted the environmental cost in a study led by [[Jean Lambert]] MEP and [[Caroline Lucas]] MEP; in addition to the extra 200 million euro spent on the extra seat, there are over 20,268&nbsp;tonnes of additional carbon dioxide, undermining any environmental stance of the institution and the Union.<ref name="Seat Green"/> The campaign is further backed by a million-strong online petition started by [[Cecilia Malmstr<U+00F6>m]] MEP.<ref>{{cite web|last = Malmstr<U+00F6>m | first = Cecilia|authorlink=Cecilia Malmstr<U+00F6>m|title = OneSeat.eu|url=http://www.oneseat.eu/|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> In 2006 there were allegations of irregularity in the charges made by the city of Strasbourg on buildings the Parliament rented which harmed the city's image further.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kroeger|first=Alix|title=EU and Strasbourg in rent row|date=2006-04-27|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4952228.stm|accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref> A poll of MEPs also found 89% of the respondents (39%) wanting a single seat, and 81% preferring Brussels.<ref>{{cite web|title = Euro MPs want to scrap Strasbourg base: poll|date=2007-06-13|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news_live/1181757615.41|publisher=EU Business|accessdate = 2007-06-22 }}</ref> Another, more academic, survey found 68% support.<ref name="Farrell Powerful"/> However, as Parliament's seat is fixed by the treaties, it can only be changed by the Council unanimously, meaning it could be vetoed by a single country:<ref name="Strange"/> notably, France.

==Future of the Parliament==
{{see|Special working group on parliamentary reform|Treaty of Lisbon}}
The [[Treaty of Lisbon]], currently in stalled [[ratification]], largely retains the reforms outlined in the rejected [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|Constitutional Treaty]].<ref>{{cite web|last =[[European Council]]|title = Brussels European Council 21/22 June 2007: Presidency Conclusions |date=2007-06-22|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/ec/94932.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-22 }}</ref> Overall, powers would be increased. For example, nearly all policy areas would fall under co-decision procedure (now called the "ordinary legislative procedure") meaning that the Parliament would have practically equal powers to those of the Council (now officially the Council of Ministers). In the remaining minority of areas in which the powers remain unequal, the Council must consult the Parliament and/or seek its approval on the legislation. The Parliament also gains greater powers over the entirety of the EU budget, not just non-compulsory expenditure, through the ordinary legislative procedure. In terms of the composition of the Parliament there would be little change, however the minimum number of seats would be increased from 5 to 6 and the maximum number would be reduced from 99 to 96. There would also be basic rules on the distribution of seats in the Parliament, rather than them being negotiated at each enlargement. Decisions about the composition of the Parliament are currently made by the Council, this would remain so but the decision would be made based on a proposal from the Parliament itself.<ref name="Constitution info">{{cite web|title = The Union's institutions: The European Parliament|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/parliament_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}</ref><ref name="Reform Draft Open">{{cite web|title =Draft treaty modifying the treaty on the European Union and the treaty establishing the European community|date=2007-07-24|publisher=[[Open Europe]]|url=http://www.openeurope.org.uk/research/translation.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-07-28 }}</ref>

The European Council would be bound to take into account the latest elections when proposing the Commission President, something that they willingly did after the 2004 election. As currently, the Parliament's consent is needed for the President to take office, however the Treaty of Lisbon now uses the word "elect" rather than "approve" to refer to this procedure. This is an area however in which the Council of Ministers plays no part.<ref name="Constitution info"/><ref name="Reform Draft Open"/> It will remain to be seen whether calling it an election will spur political groups to use their power and mandate to propose their own candidate rather than accept that of the European Council, similar to the situation in [[constitutional monarchies]] where the [[head of state]] has the power to choose the [[head of government]] but is ''de facto'' limited into accepting the candidate of the victorious party in parliament. There have been suggestions that the parliament's political groups may propose their own candidates before the 2009 election.<ref name="Palmer"/><ref name="FU Leadership">{{cite web|title=Leadership of the EU|publisher=[[Federal Union]]|url=http://www.federalunion.org.uk/europe/democracyleadership.shtml|accessdate = 2007-08-27 }}</ref> No major party proposed a candidate in 2004 with the fractious nature of the European-level parties being, in part, why a single candidate has not been proposed. However there are plans to strengthen the political parties before the elections<ref name="EUO Political"/><ref name="Euractiv elect deficit">{{cite web|title =The EP elections: Deepening the democratic deficit|publisher=Euractiv|date=2004-06-16|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/future-eu/ep-elections-deepening-democratic-deficit/article-128495|accessdate = 2007-07-27 }}</ref> and the [[European Green Party]], the first to have a common campaign, did manage to put forward a candidate.<ref name="Epin"/> In 2007, [[Franco Frattini]] indicated he would like to act as though the treaty was already in force, in respects to the Parliament's powers over justice and criminal matters, in order to inject more democracy and ensure the Parliament had over sight on forthcoming legislation Frattini did not wish to delay until 2009.<ref name="Frattini 2009"/>

In addition to the institutional reforms brought by the Treaty of Lisbon, in 2007 the President set up the [[Special working group on parliamentary reform]] to improve the efficiency and image of the Parliament. Some ideas include livening up the plenary sessions and a State of the Union debate.<ref name="SWGOPR">{{cite web|title = Improving the public perception and efficiency of the work of the European Parliament&nbsp;<U+2014> mandate for a working group on reform of the Parliament|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|date=2007-02-15|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20070215IPR03201|accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}</ref> One of the group's key reform ideas, extra debates on topical issues, was rejected by MEPs<ref>{{cite web|last=Kubosova|first=Lucia|title=MEPs turn down modernising reform|publisher=EU Observer|date=2007-07-12|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24472|accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref> causing [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe|liberal]] leader [[Graham Watson]] MEP to withdraw from the reform group.<ref name="Leaders Plenary"/> However MEPs did back a proposal for greater use of the [[European symbols]], following their rejection in the Treaty of Lisbon. It was suggested the Parliament take the ''[[avant-garde]]'' in using the symbols as it had done in adopting the flag in 1983, which was three years before the Communities as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|last=Beunderman|first=Mark|title=MEPs defy member states on EU symbols|publisher=EU Observer|date=2007-07-11|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24464|accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=The European Flag|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]|date=|url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/About_Coe/flag.asp|accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref> An interim report was presented in September 2007 and proposed cutting down time allocated for guest speakers and non-legislative documents. In 2006, 92 "own initiative" reports (commenting rather than legislating) were tables and 22% of debating time was spent debating such reports, while only 18% was spent on legislative bills. The group is due to produce a final report in July 2008, and put the recommendations into practice by the 2009 elections<ref name="SWGOPR"/> however Watson has stated that he doubts the left-right coalition in Parliament can pass the proposals due to opposition from more conservative members. Other members such as the co-chair of [[Independence and Democracy|ID]], [[Jens-Peter Bonde]] MEP, had wanted more radical proposals. Bonde did however vote for the report, stating that "it is psychologically important to show that we want to become a more political parliament."<ref name="Leaders Plenary">{{cite web|last=Kubosova|first=Lucia|title=MEPs want to see fewer heads of state in plenary|publisher=EU Observer|date=2007-09-20|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24801|accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref>
