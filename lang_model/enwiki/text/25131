'''Paul Bernard Krichell''' (December 19, 1882 <U+2013> June 4, 1957) was a [[Major League Baseball]] [[catcher]] who played two seasons for the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]] in the [[American League]]. He is known for being the head scout for the [[New York Yankees]] for 37 years until his death. Krichell's talent evaluations and signings were a key reason for the Yankees' dynasty from the [[Murderer's Row]] teams of the 1920s to the 1950s teams led by [[Casey Stengel]].<ref name=dynasty>{{cite book |title=Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?|first=Bill|last=James|authorlink=Bill James|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=0684800888 |page=217}}</ref>

After an unsuccessful career as a backup catcher and [[coach (baseball)|coach]], Krichell was signed as a [[Scout (sport)|scout]] by Yankees manager [[Ed Barrow]] in 1920. Considered to be one of the greatest scouts in baseball history, he signed over 200 players who later played professional baseball.<ref name=mainsource>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MiwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27&dq=Paul+Krichell&cd=1#v=onepage&q=Paul%20Krichell&f=false|accessdate=February 4, 2009|date=July 1957|pages=27<U+2013>39|title=36 Years as a Yankee|first=Dave|last=Caremer|publisher=Baseball Digest}}</ref> His discoveries included future [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]rs [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Hank Greenberg]], [[Phil Rizzuto]], [[Bill Dickey]],<ref name=Dickey>{{cite book |title=The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|first=Bill|last=James|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=0684806975 |page=256}}</ref> [[Whitey Ford]], and [[Tony Lazzeri]].

==Early life==
Krichell was born in [[New York City]], the son of a [[Germans|German]] cabinetmaker.<ref name=mainsource/> He grew up in [[The Bronx]] near [[Yankee Stadium]], and was the youngest of nine siblings.<ref name=mainsource/> He started out as a catcher with the [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining, New York]] club in the [[Hudson River League]]'s inaugural season in 1903.<ref name=obit/> He first played for [[Ed Barrow]] in 1910, when Barrow became manager of the [[Montreal Royals]]. With the Royals, Krichell also played [[third baseman|third base]].<ref name="Barrowsource">{{cite book |title=Ed Barrow: The Bulldog Who Built the Yankees' First Dynasty|first=Daniel R.|last=Levitt|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=9780803229747|page=75}}</ref>

==Playing career==
The [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]] signed Krichell in 1911. He was used as a backup catcher during his career. During the 1911 season, he played in 28 games, collecting a [[batting average]] of .232 with 19 [[hit (baseball)|hits]] and 8 [[RBI|runs batted in]] on 82 [[at bats]].<ref name=stats>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/krichpa01.shtml|accessdate=February 4, 2009|title=Paul Krichell|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> The following year, he played in 59 games while sharing catching duties with [[Jim Stephens]]. In 161 [[at-bat]]s, Krichell had 35 hits, amassing a .217 batting average.<ref name=stats/> His [[fielding (baseball)|fielding]] was among the worst in the league for catchers, with a [[fielding percentage]] of .943 that season.<ref name=stats/> 

During a 1912 game, [[Ty Cobb]] stole [[Baseball field#Second base|second]], [[Baseball field#Third base|third]], and [[home plate]] in the same inning against Krichell.<ref name="mainbooksource">{{cite book|title=Luckiest man: the Life and Death of Lou Gehrig|first=Jonathan|last=Eig|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=0743245911 |pages=38<U+2013>40}}</ref> In a later game, Krichell was injured when Cobb [[List of baseball jargon (S)#spike|spiked]] him using his [[Cleat (shoe)|cleats]] during a play at home plate. Cobb spiked Krichell in his arm, almost detaching it from his shoulder and effectively ending his major league career.<ref name="careerended">{{cite book|title=My Life in Baseball: The True Record |first=Ty|last=Cobb|authorlink=Ty Cobb|coauthors=Al Stump|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803263597|page=94}}</ref>

==Managing career==
The Browns released Krichell after the 1912 season. He recovered from his injury, and played six seasons in the minor leagues. He became the manager for the [[Eastern League (baseball, 1916<U+2013>32)|Eastern League]]'s [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] club from 1917 to 1918.<ref name="Levitt: pg. 188">Levitt: pg. 188</ref> He resigned on June 27, 1918, after two wins were taken from him because he used a player not under contract.<ref name=resigned>{{cite news|title=Yanks's Lose in 9th, Fall Back on Race|page=10|newspaper=Hartford Courant|date=June 18, 1918|accessdate=February 11, 2009}}</ref> During the offseason, Krichell became a [[Bar (establishment)|saloon]] owner, popular with players in the Bronx.<ref name=saloon>{{cite book|title=Baseball's greatest pitchers|first=Thomas|last=Meany|publisher=A.S.

==Scouting career==
[[File:Gehrig cropped.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Krichell's most significant signing for the Yankees was of [[Lou Gehrig]], when he was a player at [[Columbia University]].|alt=A photo of a man in his baseball uniform. smiling.]]
Before the 1921 season, Barrow became the new [[general manager]] of the [[New York Yankees]]. He requested that Krichell come to the Yankees as well and to become a full-time [[scout (sports)|scout]]. At the time, the Yankees had a two-man scouting rotation, and Barrow thought Krichell was the right man to upgrade the scouting staff.<ref name=mainsource/> The first player Krichell signed was [[Hinkey Haines]], an [[outfielder]] from [[Penn State University]].<ref name=obit/> He signed [[catcher]] [[Benny Bengough]] from Buffalo of the [[International League]],<ref name=mainsource/> and [[Charlie Caldwell]], a [[Princeton University]] graduate. A pitcher who only appeared in three games in his major league career, Caldwell was used mainly as a batting practice pitcher. During one of these practices, he hit [[Wally Pipp]] in the head with a high fastball, fracturing his skull.<ref>Eig: pg. 66</ref> That led the way for [[Lou Gehrig]] to take over Pipp's place in the starting lineup.<ref>Eig: pg. 67</ref>

===Discovery of Gehrig===
Early in the [[1923 New York Yankees season|1923 season]], Krichell traveled from [[spring training]] in [[New Orleans]] to [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] for a [[Columbia University]] <U+2013> [[Rutgers University]] baseball game.<ref name="Eig: pg. 38">Eig: pg. 38</ref> He ended up on the same train with [[Andy Coakley]], the manager for the Columbia University squad that day.<ref name="Eig: pg. 39">Eig: pg. 39</ref> Coakley started talking with Krichell about [[Lou Gehrig]], a left-handed pitcher on his squad who could also hit.<ref name=obit/><ref name="Eig: pg. 39"/> Gehrig hit two home runs in three at-bats that day.<ref name="Eig: pg. 39"/> After the game, Krichell spoke with Barrow, saying that he found the "next [[Babe Ruth]]".<ref name="Frommer: pg. 44">Frommer: pg. 44</ref> Skeptical, Barrow sent Krichell to watch Columbia's next game against [[New York University]].<ref name="Eig: pg. 39"/> Gehrig hit a home run that reportedly went out of the park.<ref>Eig: pg. 40</ref>  After the game, Gehrig, on Krichell's urging, signed for $2,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000|1923|2010|r=-4}}}} in 2010) for the rest of the 1923 season, and a $1,500 bonus (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1500|1923|2010|r=-4}}}} in 2010).<ref name="Frommer: pg. 44"/> Krichell also persuaded Gehrig to give up [[pitcher|pitching]] and focus on being a hitter.<ref name=sign>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1125378/index.htm|accessdate=February 4, 2010|date=April 12, 1982|title=Scouts Stay Persona Non Grata To Baseball's Hall Of Fame Committee|first=Ivan|last=Maisel|publisher=Sports Illustrated}}</ref>

On June 11, 1923, Krichell and Coakley decided to meet Gehrig in [[Yankee Stadium]] for his first day with the team.<ref>Eig: pg. 41</ref> Gehrig did batting practice with the Yankees, while Krichell informed manager [[Miller Huggins]] about the player.<ref>Eig: pg. 44</ref> Huggins sent Gehrig to the [[Hartford Senators]], where after a hot start in Hartford, Gehrig went though a long slump and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], leading him to consider quitting baseball.<ref>Eig: pg. 48</ref> Upon hearing this, Krichell was sent to Hartford to speak with Gehrig. During a steak dinner, he found out that Gehrig was drinking. He told Gehrig that the best players slump from time to time, and gave batting advice to Gehrig, including one of [[Ty Cobb]]'s batting tricks.<ref>Eig: pg. 49</ref> Gehrig started hitting again, and he eventually joined the Yankees.

==Later signings==
While Krichell was working on getting Lou Gehrig signed, he was watching [[Jimmie Foxx]] and [[Mickey Cochrane]] play in the [[Eastern Shore League]], and was planning to sign both of them when Barrow telegramed from New York, saying that a minor leaguer had refused to report to the [[Minneapolis Millers]], and the team was going to lose $10,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1924|2010|r=-4}}}} in 2010).<ref name=mainsource/> By the time the situation with the minor leaguer (who never advanced to the Majors) was taken care of, Foxx and Cochrane were signed by the [[Philadelphia Athletics]].<ref name=mainsource/>

[[File:Babe Ruth2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Krichell was with [[Babe Ruth]], when Ruth had the "bellyache heard around the world". Krichell's fast timing to take him to the hospital potentially saved Ruth's life.|alt=A black and white photo of a man posting in front of the camera. He is wearing his uniform, holding a baseball bat. He is slightly looking away from the camera with a serious stare. An autograph of the subject is also seen in the middle of the picture.]]
Before the [[1925 New York Yankees season]] began, [[Babe Ruth]] collapsed at an [[Asheville, North Carolina]] train station. [[Miller Huggins]] assigned Krichell to drive Ruth to the nearest hospital, potentially saving Ruth's life.<ref name="illness">{{cite book |title=The Life and times of Babe Ruth|first=Leigh|last=Montville|publisher=DoubleDay Books|isbn=0-385-51437-8|pages=202}}</ref> He got in a train to New York with Ruth, who had emergency surgery for a "intestinal abscess" that left him hospitalized for six weeks.<ref name=Ruthsick>{{cite news |title=Touching Base.

Krichell went to [[Hartford, Connecticut]] to sign [[shortstop]] [[Leo Durocher]] for a $7,500 bonus (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7500|1925|2010|r=-4}}}} in 2010).<ref name=Durocher>{{cite book |title=Branch Rickey: Baseball's Ferocious Gentleman|first=Lee|last=Lowenfish|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=9780803224537|page=225}}</ref> While finishing arrangements with Durocher, Krichell received a call from Barrow to go to [[Salt Lake City]] to watch a young second baseman named [[Tony Lazzeri]]. During the previous season, Lazzeri, who had [[epilepsy]],<ref name=epileptic>{{cite book |title=Baseball Dynasties: The Greatest Teams of All Time |first=Rob|last=Neyer|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|isbn=0393048942|page=95}}</ref> hit 60 [[home run]]s and batted in over 200 runs for the [[Salt Lake Bees]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]].<ref>Frommer: pg. 49</ref> The Bees were asking for $50,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1925|2010|r=-4}}}} in 2010), while several scouts saw him only worth a tenth of that.<ref name=mainsource/> The [[Chicago Cubs]] were given a first look for a discounted rate, but passed on the offer.<ref name=mainsource/> Krichell saw a promising player in Lazzeri and convinced Barrow to buy him from the Bees.<ref name=mainsource/> Around the same time, he helped acquire shortstop [[Mark Koenig]] from the [[Minneapolis Millers]].<ref>Gallagher: pg. 123</ref> With these signings, Krichell helped build the [[1927 New York Yankees season|1927 New York Yankees team]], considered by many to be the greatest team ever assembled.<ref>Gallagher: pg. 5</ref> Krichell signed four starters from the squad, including three-fourths of its [[infield]] and [[Mike Gazella]], its main backup, who signed for $500 in 1923 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500|1923|2010|r=-4}}}} in 2010).<ref>Frommer: pg. 56</ref> The Yankees swept the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in four games to win the [[1927 World Series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1927_WS.shtml|title=1927 World Series - New York Yankees Over Pittsburgh Pirates (4-0)|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdat2010-05-08}}</ref>

Krichell signed [[Billy Werber]] from [[Duke University]] to practice for the [[1927 New York Yankees season|1927 season]].<ref name=Werber>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2008-06-14-oldest-ballplayer_N.htm|accessdate=February 4, 2010|date=June 14, 2008|title=Oldest living ex-major leaguer has stories to tell|first=Mike|last=Cranston|publisher=USA Today}}</ref> He left the team after a month, but re-signed when he graduated from Duke in 1930. During that time, Werber was involved in one of the worst deals for a player from the era. Krichell was in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] when Barrow assigned him to travel to [[Durham, North Carolina]] to negotiate with the [[Durham Bulls]] for a outfielder named [[Dusty Cooke]].<ref name=mainsource/> Neither Krichell nor Barrow had seen Cooke; however, he was believed to be a great hitter, though Cooke had hardly played for the Bulls.<ref name=mainsource/> The Yankees signed him for $15,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|15000|1930|2010|r=-4}}}} in 2010), beating the [[Cleveland Indians]]' offer of $12,500 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|12500|1930|2010|r=-4}}}} in 2010) and a player to be named.<ref name=mainsource/> Cooke turned out to be a injury-prone [[fourth outfielder|backup outfielder]], and the Yankees gave up on both players. After the [[1933 New York Yankees season|1933 season]], the two were sent to the [[Boston Red Sox]] for cash considerations.<ref name=mainsource/>

In the summer of 1929, he discovered [[Hank Greenberg]] while on a scouting trip though [[Massachusetts]]. Krichell thought he just discovered the next [[Lou Gehrig]].<ref name="Eig: pg. 133">Eig: pg. 133</ref> Krichell offered Greenberg a $10,000 contract (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1929|2010|r=-4}}}} in 2010) on the spot, knowing his ability, and also knowing that the Yankees were looking for [[Jewish]] players in order to build their Jewish fanbase.<ref name="Eig: pg. 133"/> Greenberg talked to his father before making the deal, but declined it because he knew he would not get a chance to play with Gehrig already the [[first baseman]].<ref>Eig: pg. 134</ref> Krichell referred Greenberg to the [[Detroit Tigers]], who offered him a contract.

===1930s===
In the early 1930s, Krichell focused on [[Ivy League]] pitchers, saying that he preferred signing pitchers who knew how to think.<ref name=mainsource/> He signed [[Charlie Devens]] from [[Harvard University]], who Krichell said could have been great had he continued to play baseball.<ref name=mainsource/> He scouted pitcher [[Johnny Broaca]] from [[Yale University]], who seemed to be heading to stardom, [[win (baseball)|winning]] 12 games in his first three seasons with the Yankees, until suddenly retiring to become a professional [[boxing|boxer]].<ref>Gallagher: pg. 38</ref> 

Krichell signed pitcher [[Marius Russo]] from [[Long Island University]] in 1935.<ref name=Russo>{{cite book |title=Pride of October: What It Was to Be Young and a Yankee|first=Bill|last=Madden|publisher=Warner Books|isbn=0446692697|page=26}}</ref> Russo was placed in a [[semi-professional]] team by a local scout who worked with Krichell.<ref name="Madden: pg. 27">Madden: pg. 27</ref> When he deemed Russo was ready, he signed with the Yankees for $750.<ref name="Madden: pg. 27"/> He twice became a 14-game winner, and was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] in 1941 before hurting his arm. Krichell also signed [[Hank Borowy]] from [[Fordham University]] for $8,500, later the [[ace (baseball)|ace]] for the Yankees during the [[World War II|wartime era]].<ref name=mainsource/> He discovered [[Johnny Allen (baseball)|Johnny Allen]] by a chance encounter. Allen worked as a desk clerk for a [[Sanford, North Carolina]] hotel. He recognized Krichell as a scout, told him that he was a pitcher, and that he wanted to try out. Krichell agreed, and was impressed by Allen's ability, signing him to a minor league contract.<ref name="Allen">{{cite book |title=The Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia|first=Russell|last=Schneider|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC.|isbn=0803263597|page=128}}</ref>

Aside from his Ivy League pitcher focus, Krichell also signed several position players. He signed [[Charlie Keller]], who was a highly touted prospect playing for the [[University of Maryland]]. In order to get Keller to sign, Krichell managed to stay and have dinner with his family.<ref name=mainsource/> Krichell signed [[shortstop]] [[Phil Rizzuto]] to a contract in 1937. Rizzuto previously tried out with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]], but was dismissed by them for being too small.<ref>Gallagher: pg. 342</ref> Krichell decided to look at the infielder despite this, and was impressed by the way Rizzuto turned [[double play]]s; his technique reminded Krichell of [[Leo Durocher]], one of his favorite players.<ref name=mainsource/> He signed Rizzuto for $75 a month (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|75|1937|2010|r=-4}}}} in 2010) and sent him to the Yankees' farm club in [[Bassett, Virginia]].<ref>Madden: pg. 4</ref>

===1940s<U+2013>1950s===
Krichell's next target was [[second baseman]] [[Snuffy Stirnweiss]] from the [[University of North Carolina]]. First, he tried to convince Stirnweiss to bypass [[american football|football]] for baseball. Stirnweiss refused, but his father's death soon after his college graduation left him as the sole supporter of his mother and younger brother.<ref name=snuffy>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BS4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA4&dq=paul+krichell&cd=3#v=onepage&q=paul%20krichell&f=false|accessdate=February 9, 2009|date=Jan 1948|page=4|title=Bronx Express:Snuffy Stirnweiss|first=Charles|last=Dexter|publisher=Baseball Digest}}</ref> Krichell signed Stirnweiss to a contract soon afterwards.

In a mass tryout for the Yankees team, Krichell scouted first baseman [[Whitey Ford]]. Krichell told Ford that he had a strong arm, and recommended that he develop a [[curveball]] to try pitching.<ref name=Ford>{{cite book |title=Before the Glory: 20 Baseball Heroes Talk about Growing Up and Turning Hard ...|first=Billy|last=Staples|publisher=Health Communications Inc.|isbn=0757306268 |pages=306<U+2013>308}}</ref> With his new curveball, Ford helped his team win the New York City [[sandlot ball]] championship, and was signed by Krichell for $7,000 in 1947 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7000|1947|2010|r=-4}}}} in 2010).<ref name=Ford/> Ford later became ace of the Yankees for most of the 1950s and 1960s, and a Baseball Hall of Famer.

Krichell played a factor in signing future All-Star [[Tommy Byrne (baseball)|Tommy Byrne]].<ref name="Staples: pg. 45">Staples: pg. 45</ref> He was referred by one of his scouts, [[Gene McCann]], to see Byrne pitch for [[Wake Forest University]].<ref name="Staples: pg. 45"/> Impressed with what he saw, Krichell signed him for $10,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1940|2010|r=-4}}}} in 2010).<ref>Staples: pg. 46</ref> He also signed [[Red Rolfe]], [[Johnny Murphy]], and [[Vic Raschi]].<ref name=obit/> 

Krichell supervised the expansion of the New York Yankees scouting staff from two men to more than twenty part-time scouts by 1957.<ref name=obit/> Among the scouts he hired for the Yankees were former players [[Babe Herman]], [[Atley Donald]], [[Jake Flowers]] and [[Johnny Neun]].<ref name=scoutshehired>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1128989/2/index.htm|accessdate=February 4, 2010|date=September 20, 1954|title=New York Yankee Organization|first=Robert|last=Shaplen|publisher=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> As he hired more scouts, Krichell reduced his job capacity, becoming the chief scout, and the regional scout for the [[New England]] area.<ref name=scoutshehired/>

==Final days==
In 1954, Krichell was honored by the [[Baseball Writers Association of America]] with the William J. Slocum Memorial Award. Named after the former head sportswriter of the [[New York Journal American]] and president of the BBWAA, the award honored his longevity in baseball.<ref name=obit/> 

The final two players Krichell signed were two [[Bonus Rule|bonus babies]]: [[Tom Carroll (infielder)|Tom Carroll]], from [[Notre Dame University]]; and [[Frank Leja]], an 18 year old first baseman. Krichell advised the Yankees staff to sign Carroll for $30,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|30000|1954|2010|r=-4}}}} in 2010).<ref name=obit/> Leja, Krichell thought, could be the next Gehrig, but both flopped.<ref>Gallagher: pg. 250</ref> By the time he retired, he was the most experienced employee still working for the Yankees.<ref name=obit/>

Krichell died on June 4, 1957 at his home in the [[Bronx]] after a lengthy illness.<ref name=obit/> He had surgery for [[Crohn's disease]] in 1955 after losing 60 pounds in 60 days.<ref name=mainsource/> His wife of 50 years, Mary, died earlier in the year.<ref name=obit/> He had one daughter, Katherine, and several grandchildren at the time of his death.<ref name=obit/>

==Scouting style==
When he first started his scouting career, Krichell followed the example of early baseball scouts. He traveled with the Yankees for [[spring training]] to view his signees playing baseball. When the Yankees traveled north to begin their season, Krichell usually followed.<ref name="Eig: pg. 38"/> He also scouted the local newspapers to look for games in which potential prospects were playing.<ref name="Eig: pg. 39"/> 

His style of scouting was used as an example by future scouts to evaluate players. He usually ignored the obvious tools such as [[batting (baseball)|ability to hit]], his size, speed, and [[human power]], saying that "any dope" could see it.<ref name=mainsource/> When he scouted a future player, his top priority was to check if the subject could handle the pressure of playing [[Major League Baseball]].<ref name="handle">{{cite book |title=American Baseball: From the Commissioners to Continental Expansion, Volume II|first=David|last=Quentin Voigt|publisher=Penn State University Press|isbn=0271003308|page=177}}</ref> When he got word of a possible prospect, he went to see the player in action. If he liked what he saw, he talked to the player and his family about his goals and motive for playing the game.<ref name=mainsource/> He decided whether the player was ready for the Yankees or one of their [[farm team]]s to use. He tended to take a risk with players passed by other teams.<ref name="teams">{{cite book |title=Management Wisdom from the New York Yankees' Dynasty |first=Lance A.|last=Berger|coauthors=Dorothy R. Berger|publisher=Wiley Publishers|isbn=0471715549|page=99}}</ref> He let a player's weaknesses slide if the rest of their skills were up to par, such as the case with [[Tony Lazzeri]], who was a poor [[fielding (baseball)|fielder]].<ref name=mainsource/> Krichell also was one of the first that noticed that being smart mattered in a game filled with uneducated people. Most of his signings were college graduates who Krichell believed thought better to win.<ref name="thinksbetter">{{cite book|title=A Farewell to Heroes|first=Frank|last=Graham|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|isbn=0809324911 |page=141}}</ref>

Other times, Krichell collected some of the best [[amateur baseball in the United States|prospects]] in an area, normally 300 or more, and put them through a grueling four-day workout. It normally consisted of a workout in the morning and a full game in the afternoon.<ref>Madden. pg. 5</ref> There, Krichell and his staff sorted though players they believed could become useful in the organization, and dropped those they thought were not motivated for the game.
