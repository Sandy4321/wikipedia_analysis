'''Michael John Milton''', [[Order of Australia|OAM]] (born 21 March 1973, [[Canberra]]) is an Australian [[Winter Paralympics|Winter Paralympic]] [[skiing|skier]] and [[cyclist]]. He lost a [[human leg|leg]] to [[bone cancer]] when he was nine years old. He grew up into a skiing family, and after losing his leg he was determined to be able to ski again. 

==Career==
At the age of 14, he competed in the [[1988 Winter Paralympics]] in [[Innsbruck]], Austria. There he achieved a 12th in the [[Slalom skiing|slalom]], an 11th in the [[Giant Slalom]] and an 18th in the [[downhill]]. In the [[1992 Winter Paralympics]] in Albertville, France, Michael picked up gold medal in the Slalom, which was the first winter Olympic gold for Australia, Winter Paralympics or Winter Olympics. He also got silver in the [[Super G]]. From there on he got a medal in every event he competed in at every Winter Paralympics. At the [[2002 Winter Paralympics]], he won every skiing event. 

Since then, the rules for his category have changed. From 2006 onwards, his category included anyone who could stand, whereas previously it had been people with only one leg. The [[2006 Winter Paralympics]] were his last. In his career he has won 11 Paralympics medals (6 gold, 3 silver and 2 bronze). His appearance at the 2006 Winter Paralympics was his fifth and final one, after which he focused more fully on [[speed skiing]]. 

In April 2005, he was the first person with a disability to break the 200 kilometres per hour mark with a speed of 210.4 km/h.  He then aimed to beat the Australian open record of 212.26 km/h, set in 1997 by able-bodied athlete Nick Kirshner. <ref name="AlpineNewsEarly2006">"Michael Milton - is there anything this man can't do?" - Australian Alpine News, Early Season 2006.</ref> On 19 April, 2006, he became the fastest Australian speed skier - able-bodied or disabled - after setting a world record at 213.65km/h in France.

On 12 July 2007, it was announced on ''Sports Tonight'' that Michael has been diagnosed with oesophagal cancer. He had a six centimetre tumour removed from his throat and is now in remission. Less than a year later, he was selected for the [[2008 Summer Paralympics|Beijing Paralympics]], his first [[Summer Paralympics]], as a cyclist.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://news.theage.com.au/sport/ski-star-milton-to-cycle-in-beijing-20080606-2mnj.html | title=Ski Star Milton to cycle in Beijing | publisher=The Age | accessdate=2008-06-07 }}</ref>
