'''Arequipa''' is the capital and largest city of the [[Arequipa Province|province of Arequipa]] and the seat of the Constitutional Court.   Also known as the White City, it is the second most populous city in [[Peru]], with 844,407 inhabitants according to INEI projections.<ref name="proyeccion2012INEI">{{cite web |url=http://www.inei.gob.pe/web/NotaPrensa/Attach/14584.pdf |format=pdf |title=Poblaci<U+00F3>n oficial 2012 |language=Spanish |deadurl=no |accessdate=13 December 2012}}</ref>

Arequipa is an important commercial center of Peru<ref name="chanfreau40p">Chanfreau, p. 40</ref> and is the second most industrialized city in the country.<ref name="export17p">Mincetur. "Export Investment Guide", p. 17</ref> Its industrial activity includes manufacturing and the exporting of high quality wool. The city has close trade ties with [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Brazil]].

The city was founded on the 15th of August, 1540, under the name of 'Villa Hermosa de Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de la Asunci<U+00F3>n" in the name of the Marquis Don [[Francisco Pizarro]].  In the Royal Decree of September 22, 1541, King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of Spain ordered that it be called the "City of Arequipa."

In the Colonial period it became important for its economic role<ref name="chanfreau40p"/> and it was noted for its faithfulness to the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Crown]].;<ref name="linares115p">Linares M<U+00E1>laga, p. 115.</ref>

In the Republican history of Peru the city acquired greater prominence in politics,<ref name="ponce53p"/> being the focus of popular rebellions.  Many Peruvian intellectual, political, and religious figures became prominent in this era.  During this time it was awarded the title of "Heroica ciudad de los libres de Arequipa".<ref name="neira438p"/>

Its historic center is spread over an area of 332 hectares<ref name="compendio80p">Provincial Municipality of Arequipa. "Compendium of rules of the historic center of Arequipa", p. 80.</ref> and is a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site.<ref name="unesco">{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1016 |title=Historical Centre of the City of Arequipa |accessdate=4 August 2009 |author=UNESCO |date=30 November 2000}}</ref> Its historic  heritage, along with its many scenic and cultural sites, make the city a national and international tourist destination.

== Place names ==
The name of the city is the Spanish version of the name of the valley in which the city was founded.  Based on etymology and traditions, there are various tales that attempt to explain the origins of the name.

One folkloric tradition states that the [[Inca]] [[Mayta C<U+00E1>pac|Mayta Capac]] received a petition from his subjects to reach the valley of the River Chili. They asked him for permission to stay in the region.  They marveled at the beauty of the landscape and the mild climate. The Inca answered ''"qhipay Ari"'' (Quechua: ''"Yes, stay"),''.<ref name="garayar51p">{{harv|Garayar|p=51|2004|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>
[[File:Bas<U+00ED>lica Catedral de Arequipa.jpg|thumb|340px|right|View of the main square of the city of Arequipa, located in the heart of the historic center of Arequipa and founding centre of it. From left to right are the Municipality of El Portal, Portal de San Agustin, the portals of the cathedral and the Basilica Cathedral of Arequipa.]]
Padre [[Blas Valera]] and [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]] suggested that the name of the city came from an ancient [[Aymara language|Aymara]] word, "ari qquepan", meaning "trumpet sound".  It referred to the sound made from blowing into the empty conch-like shell of a sea snail.<ref name="palma30p">{{harv|Palma|1893|p=29|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>

Another possible etymological source<ref name="Etimologia">[http://www.saludarequipa.gob.pe/epidemiologia/ASIS/Asis2004/ASIS%20PRIMERA%20PARTE%202004.pdf Toponymy "Arequipa"]</ref> comes from the [[Aymara language|Aymara]] language with the phrase " qhipaya ari "or" Ariq qipa 'ari (acute, sharp or pointed) and qhipaya (behind), which translates to "behind the peak," referring to the nearby volcano, El Misti.

=== Names and qualifications ===
Arequipa was one of the cities of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] that was more intense flattery<ref name="historia">[http://sisbib.unmsm.edu.pe/BibVirtual/libros/Literatura/melgar/en_arequipa.htm History and legend, Mariano Melgar]</ref> Among the various praise found for the city in literature is a reference in the play "[[La Galatea]]" by Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, which mentions that the Spanish poet Diego Rivera Martinez, having been to Arequipa, refers to the city<ref name="historia"/> with the phrase "In Arequipa, eternal spring".<ref>Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra. La Galatea, The song of Calliope, Madrid (1585), the reference to Martinez de Ribera, in 66 and 67 octaves.</ref>

It also highlights the various distinctions awarded by the Spanish Crown, which where the titles of City, Coat of Arms, Very Noble and Loyal, Faithful, and treatment of Excellence.<ref name="neira226p">{{harv|Neira|p=226|1990|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>

'''Very noble and very loyal'''

'''Faithful'''

The ruling classes and city leaders rallied always faithful and loyal to the Spanish crown the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in the eighteenth century, upon the different movements and rebellions indigenous and mestizo, Arequipa retained its political balance. The Tupac Amaru II uprising facing the city with a column of troops assembled at their expense, helped destroy the siege of the city La Paz,<ref name="neira227p">{{harv|Neira|p=227|1990|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> which earned it the epithet of "Restorative province of Collao <U+00BB>. For these services the King Carlos IV, a royal decree issued in the city of San Lorenzo on 5 December 1805 in which orders and intitul<U+00E9> be called Faithful.<ref name="neira228p"/>

'''Excellence'''

By royal decree issued in the city of Madrid, on 16 November 1818, is granted to the city to treat its Cabildo excellence. This distinction was granted following reports submitted by Don Hip<U+00F3>lito Unanue, deputy of the province of Arequipa and the Municipality of the city, Arequipa involvement in advocacy produces real when lifting the city La Paz in 1809.<ref name="neira228p">{{harv|Neira|p=228|1990|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>

'''Heroic City of the free'''

In the Republican era, a decree issued by General Orbegoso ordered that the department and its capital city be denominated "Department of Law" and "heroic city of free Arequipa".<ref name="neira438p">{{harv|Neira|p=438|1990|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> General Orbegoso installed his government from the 13 January 1835 in the city of Arequipa, and consequently General [[Felipe Santiago Salaverry]] named himself Supreme Chief of the Republic, with the pretext that the country was leaderless, i.e. without President, as Orbegoso was outside the capital.<ref>[http://www.congreso.gob.pe/museo/mensajes/a-Mensaje-1835-1.pdf Decree assuming command of the Republic General Felipe Santiago Salaverry, February 25, 1835] .</ref>

Salaverry's new government was recognized in various parts of the country, except for southern Peru, which continued to obey Orbegoso. A general amnesty decree, given by Salaverry in May 1835 and the call to Congress to meet in [[Jauja]], were signs that command of the country had been concentrated in the hands of Salaverry, but despite these actions Arequipa remained the only part of the country to abide by the authority of Orbegoso, who had installed his government there and whose recognition was given this name.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}<!-- Dead link<ref name="sede1"/>-->

== Symbols ==

=== Coat of arms ===
Almost a year after the founding of the town, King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] elevated it to the rank of [[city]] by a royal decree on 22 December 1540, awarding it a coat of arms, on which a mythical animal carries a banner with the inscription ''Karlos V'' or ''Del Rey,''<ref name="palma30p"/> as described by [[Ricardo Palma]] traditionalist ''Peruvian Traditions''  in his book, in which he explains the location of the components in the shield, based on a reporter's knowledge of heraldry. In the tradition of ''"The godson of providence"'',  it is explained as quoted:

{{blockquote|<U+00AB>Nada entendido en her<U+00E1>ldica el dem<U+00F3>crata que esto escribe, ati<U+00E9>nese a la explicaci<U+00F3>n que sobre tal alegor<U+00ED>a da un cronista. Dice que la inscripci<U+00F3>n de la bandera expresa la posesi<U+00F3>n que el rey tom<U+00F3> de Arequipa y que al colocar aqu<U+00E9>lla, no bajo los pies, sino en la mano del grifo, quiso el monarca manifestar su aprecio por la ciudad, no pis<U+00E1>ndola como a vasalla, sino d<U+00E1>ndole la mano como a favorecida. Si hay quien lo explique mejor, que levante el dedo.<U+00BB>|'''Ricardo Palma''', ''Tradiciones Peruanas''<ref name=palma30p/>}}

=== Flag ===
The crimson flag of the city has been the subject of debate among historians. In 1940 scientific publications Mostajo historians such as Francis and Victor M. Barriga firmly confirmed the crimson color of the banner, as opposed to the blue argued by historian Victor Benavente. This matches the color used in sports activities in the city.<ref name="galdos246p">{{harv|Gald<U+00F3>s Rodr<U+00ED>guez|p=246|1997|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> On 2 September Dr. Mostajo sent a letter to the Mayor of the City to put forward their views regarding the color of the Banner of Arequipa, basing their claims on the '''Act of the oath of King Carlos III''  ''"on''  11 August 1788. On 23 September of the same year, Father Victor M. Barriga published an important document in the Catholic newspaper ''El Deber''  that contains a description of the royal standard of Arequipa found in the ''"Act of 3 September 1789".''<ref name="neira354p">{{harv|Neira|p=354|1990|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>

Both documents state that the standard color is crimson and that its origins date back to the colonial flag of the city, which is described as cited:<ref name="neira356p">{{harv|Neira|p=356|1990|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>

=== Anthem ===
The anthem of the city is called ''the fourth centenary anthem,''  written by Emilio Pardo Valley with music Aurelio Diaz Espinoza, who won the 1939 contest called by the city council for the creation of the music and lyrics of the anthem. The award was given in 1940, since which the hymn has been sung at all civic events held in the city.<ref name="himno">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com.pe/books?id=YDplAAAAMAAJ |title=Arequipa: su pasado, presente y futuro |accessdate=17 September 2009 |author=Adela Pardo Gamez de Belaunde |date=20 February 2002 |format=PDF |language=Spanish}}</ref>

== Politics ==
During the colonial period, Arequipa never had an important official status, but played an outstanding economic role. Indeed, early on it took advantage of his situation at the crossroads on the silver road in colonial times and the wool road after independence. This privileged position allowed it to accumulate administrative, commercial and industrial power, and benefit local social classes committed to the future of the city.<ref name="chanfreau40p"/> Thus Arequipa has played an important role in the emergence of the political parties and political trends that have played a central role in Peru. Unlike most cities, Arequipa brought not only significant political figures and national policy,<ref name="cotler97p">{{harv|Cotler|2009|p=97|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> but was also the scene of several important political movements that achieved national effect.<ref name="cotler93p">{{harv|Cotler|2009|p =93|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>

From the 1820s until the end of the decade he forged a transitional society in Peru,<ref name="ponce51p">{{harv| Ponce|1960|p=51|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> also economic pillars on which the city based its support <U+2013> the manufacture of wool and Railway South <U+2013> begin to decline and for this and other reasons, Arequipa begins to produce a number of political leaders shaped by a growing middle class of professionals, intellectuals and technocrats, who will participate in the defense of the legal and economic stability.<ref name="bethell402p"/> At this stage, during which the city acquires a significant population increase, and on the other prominent political participation, becoming the country's second city, and as a city in continued defiance against Lima.<ref name="ponce53p">{{harv| Ponce|1960|p=53|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>

In this transition period intellectual groups emerge as the "Group Coven" movement whose demands were limited to political decentralization disassociating claims related to social justice and economic reform, such as land reform, and failed in an abrupt end as a result of the [[Great Depression|Great Depression.]]<ref name="love6p">{{harv|Love|1995|p=6|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> Prominent leaders also arise, Victor Andres Belaunde and [[Jos<U+00E9> Bustamante y Rivero|Jos<U+00E9> Luis Bustamante y Rivero]], leaving his mark as a strong-willed constitutionalists in early 1930, and from 1945 to 1948 [[Jos<U+00E9> Bustamante y Rivero|Jos<U+00E9> Luis Bustamante y Rivero]] who served as president of Peru.<ref name="bethell402p">{{harv|Bethell|1991|p=402|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>

In 1950 the lawyer Francisco Mostajo (prominent liberal Arequipa since 1901) is leading a revolution against Odria Arequipa, ''Arequipa''  in 1956, Fernando Belaunde Terry manages to get a large block of voting middle class in 1962 and 1963 and [[Popular Action (Peru)|Popular Action]] Belaunde Terry with the support of another party originally from Arequipa, Christian Democrats, had such strong support that was enough to win the presidency of Peru.

With a third of the electorate was allied with APRA, the lobby of Arequipa and its supporters in Lima and other parts of the country became invincible in 1945, after the ideologies clearly differ from these center-right Democrats with APRA, quickly and permanently alliance collapsed.

=== Political trend ===
The starting point of the political path followed by Arequipa is marked by the new national bourgeoisie, which appears to challenge the existing bourgeois elite in Peru, where there was a significant and growing stratum of people in Peru with professional, administrative and trade.<ref name="bethell401p">{{harv|Bethell|1991|p=401|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>

Since the 1900s the rebellious spirit Arequipa, reborn from the pen of a group of intellectuals, a new generation of liberal anticlericalism characterized by a very Catholic society and opposition to economic and political centralization of the country,<ref name="guillemete5p">{{harv|Guillemette|2010|p=5|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> this opposition Arequipa to the political and economic centralization of the country naturally led to a constitutional position in the 1930s and the subsequent adoption of ideologies Christian Democrats in the 1940s and 1950s. Lawyers and projected a strong church influence in politics Arequipa, as well as the middle class gained further declined participation to economic prosperity in the south of the country.<ref name="bethell402p"/>

These new interests take political structure more clearly inside the country whose strongest political structure was the city of Arequipa, and their potential strengths of this national election that was reflected by strength in the candidacy of Fernando Belaunde Terry in the 1956 presidential elections. The southern region, dominated by the city of Arequipa has a long history of separatism and the Republic of Peru, Arequipa and the upper class of the twentieth century has preserved a distinctive regional identity.<ref name="bethell402p"/>

Throughout history Arequipa policy have led to many uprisings that earned the city the adjective of "The Lion of the South".<ref name="leondelsur">{{cite web |url=http://linda-arequipa.com/historia-de-arequipa/levantamientos-y-revoluciones/ |title=History of Arequipa |accessdate=5 February 2010 |author=Linda Arequipa |year=2007}}</ref>  According to Leslie Bethell Cambridge University "if Arequipa was the capital of liberalism the other regions of Peru promoted their own interests only through their ideology'.<ref name="bethell403p">{{harv|Bethell|1991|p=403|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> other authors conclude that revolutions were not developed under personal interests or politicians that incentivized, but by passion for law and justice, for his religious faith and his honor.<ref name="leondelsur"/>

Leslie Bethell emphasizes the importance of revolutions of Arequipa stating:
{{quote|:<U+00AB>None of the numerous ''aprista'' insurrections in the three decades, including that in Trujillo in 1932, secured as much political leverage as these three Arequipa-based movements.<U+00BB>

: <U+00AB>Ninguna de las numerosas insurrecciones apristas en las tres d<U+00E9>cadas, incluyendo la de Trujillo en 1932, han garantizado una gran influencia pol<U+00ED>tica como estos tres movimientos surgidos en Arequipa.<U+00BB>|Leslie Bethell, ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: Latin America since 1930''<ref name=bethell403p/>}}

This revolutionary fame known among Peruvians still won it through numerous rebellions where almost all revolutions, some with national impact, armed themselves to defend local autonomy, compared to a centralizing capital more and more taking up arms in the revolutions following:<ref name="guillemete3p">{{harv|Guillemette|2010|p=3|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>

=== Seat of the Constitutional Court ===
[[File:Grau Bridge, Zemanat, Arequipa.jpg|thumb|320px|Grau Bridge View from the district of Selva Alegre.]]
{{main|Constitutional Court of Peru}}

The Constitutional Court is the highest authority and control interpretation of the Constitution. It is autonomous and independent of other constitutional bodies. Subject only to the Constitution and the Organic Law. The court has seven judges elected by the Congress with the favorable vote of at least two thirds of the legal number of members for a period of five years.

The city is the ''"Legal Capital of Peru"''  and ''"Official Headquarters of the Constitutional Court",''<ref name=coaguila4p>{{harv|Coaguila Valdivia|p=4|2010|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> as a result of a project decentralist the first vice presidential candidate, Manuel Seoane Corrales, who proposed the initiative of the city of Arequipa was the headquarters of the Superior Court of Justice, which would make the city was the Legal Capital of Peru. Due to the military coup that began in Peru, the initiative was in the air, to be reborn after the election of the Constituent Assembly in 1978. This time, the initiative did not succeed due to the high opposition, but later concluded that Arequipa would host the then "Constitutional Court", as stated in Article 304 <U+00BA> of the Constitution of Peru, 1979: ''"The Constitutional Court is based in the city of Arequipa ".''<ref name="juridica04">{{cite web |url= http://www.mariorommelarce.com/portal/la-tradicion-juridica-de-arequipa/ |title=La tradici<U+00F3>n jur<U+00ED>dica de Arequipa |accessdate=3 August 2012 |last=Rommel Arce |first=Mario}}</ref>

Later, by the Constitution of 1993, created the "Constitutional Court", which, according to its Charter, is based in Arequipa, although under Regulation Regulatory Constitutional Court.<ref name="tribunal2p">Regulation Regulatory Constitutional Court, p. 2.</ref>

=== Administrative division ===
The city is bounded by the district lines that comprise his constituency, the figure for the same population of the city is not adjusted to the total population of the districts that could be partially or fully recitals within the city, as RENIEC entities considered that the city is divided into 15 administrative districts, coordinated by the provincial municipality, which in turn are subdivided into [[district]]s,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reniec.gob.pe/portal/html/estadistica/images/GG08_PobElec_Ciudad_Arequipa.pdf |title=Distritos de Arequipa |editor=RENIEC |accessdate=11 July 2012}}</ref> however INEI uses other methodologies for the delimitation of the city.

[[File:Anntarah, Campo Redondo, Arequipa.JPG|thumb|Boutique in Piazza Campo Redondo]]
The metropolitan area is to head to the city and consists of 19 districts with metropolitan category,<ref name="muni23p2012">{{harv|Garc<U+00ED>a de los Reyes Arquitectos y Asociados|2012b|p=|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> extends over a surface of {{convert|305798|acres|0|abbr=off}} of which {{convert|10142|acres|0|abbr=on}} are distinctly urban.<ref name="muni36p2012a">{{harv|Garc<U+00ED>a de los Reyes Arquitectos y Asociados|2012a|p=36|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> A metropolitan level unemployment level reaches the level of 8%,<ref name="muni23p2012"/> in contrast to 5% unemployment in the city.<ref name="america2011"/>

== History ==

=== Prehispanic ===

Until shortly before the rise of the Inca Empire existed in what is now the city some nomads living conglomerates engaged in activities such as [[hunting]], [[fishing]] and [[Hunter<U+2013>gatherer|gathering]], developing some animals [[Domestication|domesticated]] llamas and starting mainly [[Sedentism|sedentary]] and emerging practices [[Agriculture|agriculture.]] Eventually, after migration processes within the region were established early settlements, many with connections to the sea, giving rise to the first communication channels thereby increasing the accessibility of the territory.<ref name="galdos13p"/>

During this time he built major irrigation canals or ditches in the Chili River Valley, which allowed cultivate the plains and terraces developed on the flanks of the slopes of the river. The ace Chimbe Yarabayas and settled in the city's current settlement, which together with communities and Cabanas Collaguas developed an agrarian economy in the desert.<ref name="galdos13p">{{harv|Gald<U+00F3>s Rodr<U+00ED>guez|p=13|1997|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>

===Arrival of the Incas===

When the Inca Huayna Capac came to the plain of the River Chili, founded no city, the Inca prepared to put their [[mitimaes]] control, intelligence and strength of border enclaves before expanding inland villages. To monitor and Chumbivilcas Yanaguaras intended to Chillques, for the same mission with the Callapas Collaguas and on the east of Chili, populated by Yarabaya and Copoatas, the mission fell to the Chichas.<ref name="galdos14p"/>

The task of putting mitimaes in the Inca Empire, was not related to the founding of a town, which has a connotation Hispanic Andean. That's what happened in Arequipa, as it did in Chuquisaca Huayna Capac (Charcas, of Upper Peru), where it created a people, but replaced by mitimaes natives, which was not done in the valley of the Chili.<ref name="galdos14p">{{harv|Gald<U+00F3>s Rodr<U+00ED>guez|p=14|1997|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> From a Hispanic view shows chronicling [[Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler)|Garcilaso de la Vega]], described as historically inaccurate,<ref name="galdos15p">{{harv|Gald<U+00F3>s Rodr<U+00ED>guez|p=15|1997|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> and describes that around 1170 the [[Sapa Inca|Inca]] [[Huayna Capac]] stopped with his army in the wilderness Chili River valley, which he called ''Arizona qquepay'' expression meaning "let's stay here", said Inca lands distributed among three thousand families, who founded the villages or towns of Yanahuara Caima, Tiabaya Paucarpata Socabaya Characato Chiguata and others.<ref name="garayar50p">{{harv|Garayar|p=50|2004|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>

=== Colonial era ===
Arequipa was founded on 15 August 1540 by [[Garc<U+00ED> Manuel de Carbajal|Garci Manuel de Carbajal]] in the Chili River valley as "Villa de la Asunci<U+00F3>n de Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora del Valle Hermoso de Arequipa" in an area occupied by some Indian villages.<ref name="<U+00AB>arellano257p<U+00BB>">{{harv|Arellano|sp=s<U+00ED>|p=257|1988}}</ref> Once carried out the necessary foundation to distribute the lots, for Pizarro, the Cabildo and the Dominican Order assigned for each extension a plot which covers a whole block to a plot of the founders apple quarter, and the main church a plot of half a block from the rest of solar neighbors by the passage of the Cathedral.

The city at the time of the foundation council already had a set, because the foundation of the town is given following the transfer of the Villa Hermosa de Camana, whose name was partially retained and replaced by Viila Hermosa de Arequipa,<ref name="neira244p">{{harv|Neira|p=244|1990|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> until [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of Germany and I of Spain raises it to the town to city status by Royal Decree dated [[Fuensalida]], on 22 September 1541.<ref name="cornejob35p">{{harv|Cornejo Bouroncle|1952|p=16|sp=s<U+00ED>|}}</ref> The efforts of the transfer were made by Garci Manuel de Carbajal, who was established as the political authority to make the foundation of the new town and choose the new ruler, a position he fell on Don Juan de la Torre.<ref name="neira246p">{{harv|Neira|p=246|1990|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>

The council was responsible for choosing the competent authorities who assumed office on New Year's Day, nominating the mayors, the attorney, the superintendent of the City, the faithful executor, Holders of assets of deceased hospital administrator and visitor apothecary. This political order is broken in times of civil wars, because the task of designation was made by the rebel groups benefiting its adherents.<ref name="neira247p">{{harv|Neira|p=247|1990|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> Since 1853 by order of Viceroy Mart<U+00ED>n Enr<U+00ED>quez de Almanza application starts balloting system and under this system a mayor is elected "neighborhood" and other "soldiers", who were later replaced by the mayor 'neighborhood' and ' of citizens".<ref name="neira247p"/>

At the counter, the treasurer and the royal officials Hacendaria box city, by decree of Philip II, are given the power to hold the office of alderman simultaneously, producing discord overlap of responsibilities and power. To avoid conflicts of jurisdiction, it is decided that alferazgo charges and council would sell perpetual becoming, this system was valid until the time of independence.<ref name="neira248p">{{harv|Neira|p=248|1990|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>

The former public works carried out in the city is listed on the Main Church, the Town Hall, the Chili River Bridge and the monastery of Our Lady of Grace.<ref name="neira256p">{{harv|Neira|p=256|1990|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> In 1609, by request submitted to [[Pope Paul V]] on 20 July 1609 and agreed in Bula 6 January 1612 authorizes the demarcation of the bishopric of Arequipa.

=== Independence ===
In the city lived [[Peruvian War of Independence|independence]] as all provinces of Peru, in civil war. Because of its geography and location had special circumstances, for example when [[Mateo Pumacahua|Pumacahua]] revolution and rebel troops entered briefly Arequipa was a moment of euphoria but then left the city, and remained in Arequipa colonial power until the Battle Ayacucho, not that Arequipa was against independence, but was fighting a civil war.<ref name="gadea1p">{{cite web |publisher=Universidad Cat<U+00F3>lica de Santa Mar<U+00ED>a |title=<U+00BF>Por qu<U+00E9> el Per<U+00FA> es independiente? |url=http://www.ucsm.edu.pe/arequipa/peru6.htm |accessdate=8 November 2012|work=Arequipa al d<U+00ED>a |date=23 August 2006 |language=Spanish |last=Gadea Aburto |first=Sa<U+00FA>l |editor=Arequipa al d<U+00ED>a}}</ref>

The colonial authorities were flexible address concerns freethinker of Arequipa is an example of this is the foundation of the Science and Arts Academy Lauretana on 10 December 1821, directed by Evaristo Gomez Sanchez, who was in turn the first printing department. Just built the Academy, its principal members [[Francisco Xavier de Luna Pizarro]], Aparicio G<U+00F3>mez S<U+00E1>nchez, Francisco de Paula Gonzalez Vigil, Gaulberto Valdivia, Manuel Amat y Leon and Juan de Dios Salazar, took sides in favor of emancipation.

The Bridge historian says there doubt as to which if signed first knew or Ica, the first act of independence but most said that the council was the first to do it I knew throughout Peru in April 1820.<ref name="History of Peru">History of Peru. Lexus Publishers 2000. ISBN 9972-625-35-4</ref> The historian Agustin de la Puente says a historical phenomenon happened in the stage of emancipation and independence:

{{blockquote|<U+00AB>Ese es un fen<U+00F3>meno curioso, en el sur comenzaron las revoluciones precursoras con T<U+00FA>pac Amaru, pero el sur qued<U+00F3> en poder del rey hasta m<U+00E1>s tarde.

==== Fidelismo ====
One aspect that distinguished from other areas of Arequipa and Lima [[Peru]] was particularly explicit public commitment of the city to the Spanish crown and monitoring directries closed from the kings of Spain phenomenon called ''fidelismo''  and had as remarkable defenders Francisco de Paula Quiroz, Mariano de Rivero, Nicol<U+00E1>s Fern<U+00E1>ndez, and Jos<U+00E9> Miguel de Lastarria,<ref name="garayar54p">{{harv|Garayar|p=54|2004|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> this attitude reason for the city in 1805 received the title of ''Faithful'' by Royal Charter.<ref name="caceres127p">{{harv|C<U+00E1>ceres-P<U+00E9>faur|2006|p=127|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>

Since its founding Spanish and over three centuries, the city was inhabited by mostly Spanish origin, which manifests and was recognized as a faithful follower of [[Spain]], a reason that contributed to maintaining and strengthening the Fidelismo was obviously the social structure and the prevalence of Spanish, sustained by high society and representative elements.<ref name=caceres128p>{{harv|C<U+00E1>ceres-P<U+00E9>faur|2006|sp=s<U+00ED>|p=128}}</ref> Another factor was the geographical because its location was not likely to be influenced by current or libertarian movements, and geography influenced them to disassociate Arequipa to the big Aboriginal.<ref name="caceres128p"/>

=== Republican Era ===
[[File:BCP Building Arequipa.jpg|thumb|250px|Main Office with eclectic architecture of Banco de Credito del Peru (BCP)]]
After independence, the territory corresponding to the Municipality of Arequipa department was appointed by decree of 26 May 1822. The Congress of 1826 and 1827 were as Constitutional President to Arequipa and "Lauretano<U+00BB> Javier de Luna Pizarro. During the government of [[Sim<U+00F3>n Bol<U+00ED>var|Bolivar]], after the victory of [[Battle of Ayacucho|Ayacucho]], the city was a bustling counter the spread of the dictatorial powers of the Liberator. The lawyers arequipe<U+00F1>os Domingo Tristan, Benito Lazo, Gualberto Valdivia publicly opposed the constitution and sharp Bolivarian lifetime. The result of the activity of the Academy Lauretana was the foundation of the National College of American Independence and the National University of San Agustin created in 1827.

In 1835 he moved his government [[Luis Jos<U+00E9> de Orbegoso|generally Orbegoso]] from Lima to Arequipa,{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}<!-- Dead link<ref name="sede1"/>--> and sought support from then President [[Andr<U+00E9>s de Santa Cruz]] Bolivia against the claims of [[Agust<U+00ED>n Gamarra|Gamarra]] and [[Felipe Santiago Salaverry|Salaverry.]] Deciding battles between troops and Salaverry Confederation were in Uchumayo, near the city of Arequipa, on 4 February 1836, where he defeated Salaverry, and Socabaya, three days later, on 7 February, beating [[Andr<U+00E9>s de Santa Cruz|Santa Cruz.]]<ref name="garayar56p">{{harv|Garayar|p=56|2004|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> On 18 February 1836, Salaverry and his top aides were shot in the main square of the city.<ref name="rivap">{{harv |de la Riva Ag<U+00FC>ero|sp=s<U+00ED>|p=|1858}}</ref>

After expressing their rejection of the [[Peru<U+2013>Bolivian Confederation|Confederation]], Chile sent under General [[Ventura Blanco Encalada]] a military expedition that reached the territory arequipe<U+00F1>o 12 October 1837.<ref name="pardo34p">{{harv|Pardo y Aliaga|p=34|sp=s<U+00ED>|2007}}</ref> Before going into battle were negotiations that allowed signing a peace treaty in Paucarpata, adjacent to the city district, on 17 November, between the Chilean military chief Gen. Quiroz, of the Confederation. Chile did not endorse the treaty and sent a second expedition under [[Manuel Bulnes Pinto|General Bulnes]], the following year, in support of [[Ram<U+00F3>n Castilla]] and other Peruvian military leaders opposed to Santa Cruz.<ref name="pinguioXp">{{harv|Mongui<U+00F3>|sp=s<U+00ED>|1968|p=}}</ref>

In the following years the city hosted insurrectionary successive military coups. On 20 February 1843, there was proclaimed as the supreme head of the Republic General [[Manuel Ignacio de Vivanco]], whose ambitions ended with the Battle of Carmen Alto on 22 July 1844. On 14 April 1854 from Arequipa insiri<U+00F3> as interim president General [[Ram<U+00F3>n Castilla|Ramon Castilla]], who managed to take power. Against this de facto government, on 1 November 1856 took up arms again in Arequipa, [[Manuel Ignacio de Vivanco|General Vivanco.]] After failing his military expeditions to [[Lima]] and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], had to return to Arequipa in late 1857 to organize its defense. The forces commanded by [[Miguel de San Rom<U+00E1>n]] Vivanco faced in the battle of Paucarpata on 29 June 1857.<ref name="garayar57p">{{harv|Garayar|p=57|2004|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>

==== War with Chile ====

{{main|War of the Pacific}}
Lizardo Montero arrived in Arequipa on 31 August 1882, declaring the capital of Peru. Also, Montero convened a National Congress on 28 April 1883.<ref name=neira532p>{{harv|Neira|p=532|1990|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>

Montero's government had a "National Congress" installed on 22 April 1883 in the cloisters of the College Independence and National University of San Agustin, a military support consists of all males 20 to 60 years<ref name="mcevoy222p">{{harv|Mc Evoy|p=222|sp=s<U+00ED>|1997}}</ref> that formed an army of 4,000 men and 8,000 National Guardsmen to 10 000<ref name="bulnes285p">{{harv|Bulnes|p=285|sp=s<U+00ED>|1996}}</ref> and an important financial support based on quotas and taxes erogacione both the economic elite and the various southern agricultural districts.<ref name="mcevoy222p"/>

However, Peru's Arequipa forces revolted against the authority of Lizardo Montero. On 25 October 1883, a popular uprising overthrew the government and military of [[Lizardo Montero Flores]] who retired in Arequipa to [[La Paz, Honduras|La Paz]], bringing Chilean troops under Jose Velasquez occupied the city on 29 October, this being delivered by the diplomatic corps of the city.

==== Twentieth and twenty-first centuries ====
Reached the twentieth century, the city was the scene of military coups on 22 August 1930, when the commander [[Luis Miguel S<U+00E1>nchez Cerro|Luis S<U+00E1>nchez Cerro]] was proclaimed Supreme Head and forced the resignation to President Augusto B. Leguia, and 27 October 1948, when General [[Manuel A. Odr<U+00ED>a|Manuel A. Odria]] formed a joint government and ousted President [[Jos<U+00E9> Bustamante y Rivero|Jos<U+00E9> Luis Bustamante y Rivero.]]

The city was also the scene of brave civic protests against arbitrariness.<ref name="Atlas">{{cite book |last=GARAYAR |first=Carlos |title=Atlas del Per<U+00FA> <U+2013> Arequipa |year=2003 |work=Lima: PEISA|id=992-40-315-7}}</ref> The two most important were against the [[Manuel A.

The city's economic development was favored by the railroad Arequipa [[Islay]] built by [[Henry Meiggs|Henry Meiggs.]] This was linked to the railway linking Arequipa, [[Cusco|Cuzco]] and [[Juliaca|Juliaca.]] The first telegraph system in the region, which connected [[Mollendo]], Arequipa and Vitor, was established in 1908. Drinking water was supplied to the city with an aqueduct leading Yumina mineral waters, opened in 1914. In 1931 he built roads Yura Arequipa-Puno and Arequipa. In Chili to {{convert|78|km|0|abbr=off}} from the city and 4300 masl dam was built to irrigate El Fraile 3000 ha in the plains of La Joya. This hardworking engineering work was completed in 1938. In 1940 he inaugurated the modern Alfredo Rodriguez Ballon Airport.

In the mid-nineteenth century, the expansion of international demand helped reorganize the landlords and warlords colonial exploitation of indigenous peasants in Puno through the expansion of large estates while a circle of Arequipa controlled the marketing and processing wool at the expense of rural communities.<ref name="cotler20p">{{harv|Cotler|2009|p =20|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref>

The momentum of this market, broader than deep, Arequipa is built from the second half of the nineteenth century as a city of middle classes, merchants, artisans, professionals, home to an elite regional macro in modern business city located.<ref name="cotler27p">{{harv|Cotler|2009|p =27|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> In time, the elite arequipe<U+00F1>a happens to collect, process and export wool, producing, acquiring lands medium farmers or indigenous highland and developing an operating system supported by income.

=== Climate ===

The climate of the city is predominantly dry in [[winter]], [[autumn]] and spring due to atmospheric moisture, is also due to [[Semi-arid climate|semiarid]] effective precipitation and [[Temperateness|tempered]] by the thermal condition.<ref name="Clima">[http://www.conam.gob.pe/documentos/Novedades/aire/Arequipa.pdf Climate Patterns]</ref> It lacks the rigors of winter and summers overwhelming the coast, a situation that ensures the presence of a vital sun and a clear sky<ref name="gutierrez17p"/> with 300 days of sunshine a year and a record 4000 hours of sun exposure to years justifying the nickname "City of the eternal blue sky 'funded. Throughout the year presents temperatures do not rise to {{convert|25|<U+00B0>C|0}} and rarely drop below {{convert|10|<U+00B0>C|0}}. The wet season lasts from December to March and is reflected by the presence of clouds in the afternoon and low rainfall. In winter (June, July), the weather gets a little cooler and the temperature drops to an average of {{convert|10|<U+00B0>C|0}}, but the dry climate helps to feel the cold less intensely.

The average relative humidity is 46%, with an average high of 70% in the summer season and a minimum average of 27% during the seasons of autumn, winter and spring, according to data from the weather station Goyeneche Hospital.<ref name="conam21p"/>

The winds are influenced by a system of local winds and the passage of frontal systems of low atmospheric pressure, which are conditioned by the topographical surrounding the valley where the city is. The occurrence of winds occurs mainly in the evening and early morning, mountain breezes are having a north-east direction and in the course of a day dominated by valley breezes with a South-West direction. The wind velocity along the day fluctuating between 1.5 m / s and 2.5 m / s.<ref name="conam21-22p">National Environmental Council. "To clear the air", pp. 21<U+2013>22.</ref>

Because of this, there is no doubt that the former "Villa Hermosa de Arequipa" he intended to occupy the regional capital. The city became a connecting link between Cuzco, ponds and the ocean. And in fact the city of Arequipa in the exploitation phase of silver in Potosi, has since become "'a major logistics hub." The urban setting near the present district of San Lazaro, where was erected the first chapel of the city occupied an area of 850 x 875 meters.<ref name="diagnostico12p"/>

The square foundation, located three blocks from the river and occupied an eccentric position in the founding and checkerboard patterns as Hispanic was the focal point of the city. Apples was occupied by four or eight lots, and were distributed according to their importance in the new neighborhood. With the passage of time some religious institutions came to occupy a block as the case of the Convent of Santa Catalina and San Francisco Monastery.<ref name="diagnostico12p"/>

=== Republican Era ===
In the Republican era shows a growth process similar to the colonial era, where the urban area has grown at the expense of the countryside, a process that has worsened in recent decades. The city also experienced an expansion to the east of what is now called historic, new avenues were plotted as Parra Boulevard and Twentieth Century Avenue, was established wooded neighborhood of El Vallecito, where he built the first shawls to the 1940s,<ref name="vallecito">{{cite web |url=http://www.mariorommelarce.com/portal/?p=439 |title=Los Barrios: Su histor<U+00ED>a, costumbre y tradiciones |accessdate=28 October 2009 |author=Mario Rommel Arce}}</ref> and the city extended into Yanahuara, poor people came to occupy the districts of Miraflores, Barrio Obrero, Jacinto Ibanez.

[[File:Av La Marina Arequipa.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Bridge Road Interchange Consuelo Qui<U+00F1>ones or located at the intersections of Avenue and Avenida La Marina Qui<U+00F1>ones, is part of the modernization and consolidation of the first ring road.]]

Urban architecture is extended with new construction, and moved the market town located in the Plaza de Armas to the park Duhamel and later to its present location at the Convent of the Order of St. Camillus agonizing Parents, between 1905 and 1910 Goyeneche Hospital was built, also built bridges linking the city center with the district as the bridge Yanahuara Real. By the year 1940, the first project was proposed expansion and urban facilities. This plan envisaged the creation of a ring of houses greater than existing growth plan consolidating regarding radial and concentric paths regarding land use, neighborhoods were enabled Cuarto Centenario and Selva Alegre.<ref name="diagnostico14p">Provincial Municipality of Arequipa. "Diagnosis of the historic center of Arequipa", p. 14.</ref> He was also given a boost to urban facilities with the construction of the Municipal Theatre, the Hotel de Turistas, the Municipal Library, the Athenaeum Theatre, American Independence College, Campus of the Universidad Nacional de San Agustin.<ref name="diagnostico14p"/>

Until the late 1950s there were two factors that substantially changed the trends of urban growth, the earthquakes in the years of 1958 and 1960 and the drought plateau, which accelerated peripheral growth.<ref name="diagnostico15p">Provincial Municipality of Arequipa. "Diagnosis of the historic center of Arequipa", p. 15.</ref>

This period starts with greater force the displacement of resident population sectors, there is a shift in the industry that was located in the Barrio del Solar and El Barrio Obrero<ref name="diagnostico24p">Provincial Municipality of Arequipa. "Diagnosis of the historic center of Arequipa", p. 24.</ref> following the creation of the industrial park, causing a process outsourcing of the city center towards commercial activities primarily in the informal sector.<ref name="diagnostico6p">Provincial Municipality of Arequipa. "Diagnosis of the historic center of Arequipa", p. 6.</ref> An example of this exodus is the displacement of some educational institutions that previously were located in the city center as the National University of San Agustin in the year of 1962 and residential sectors to consolidate the periphery to the center of the city as a dynamic central business district.<ref name="diagnostico15p"/>

== Economics. ==

Since Arequipa is predominantly urban, industry, commerce and construction taking place in the capital of the department have a central role in the future of the town. However, the presence of fertile valleys and high Andes allows agricultural activity has great importance for the development of the city: a central axis of the demands arequipe<U+00F1>as is building irrigation to improve their productivity. Finally, in recent times, the mining industry has entered a stage of modernity, has ceased to be only artisanal or small business to include large-scale mining, as in the case of Cerro Verde,<ref name="cotler96p">{{harv|Cotler|2009|p =96|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> established in 1993 in the Arequipa.<ref name="centrum">Centrum.

The houses, usually made in [[ashlar]], are characterized by semi-circular arches and vaulted ceilings. Ashlar structures always have thick walls: 1 to 1.5 meters for rooms, 2 meters for churches. Through the use of lime mortar, the walls are shown homogeneous image that is reinforced with brick vaults or ashlar that are justified in the rarity of the wood.<ref name="diagnostico40p">Provincial Municipality of Arequipa.

The architecture in the historic center is characterized by the prominence of ashlar, the use of which begins in the last third of the s. XVI. This volcanic stone, white or pink exceptionally soft, lightweight, and weatherproof, emerged as a seismic structural solution. The ashlar was unable to take the early years, except for the covers of the main church and some houses. The original city was built with adobe, masonry, sticks and straw roofs or mud pie. Houses of this type were made until the nineteenth century and were common in the eighteenth century, some remain in the original district of San Lazaro. Later came the brick and tile houses with tile found in the Monastery of Santa Catalina. The cataclysm of 1582 settled these systems and raised the earthquake reconstruction. Then came the ashlar as prime structural solution.<ref name="diagnostico18p">Provincial Municipality of Arequipa. "Diagnosis of the historic center of Arequipa", p. 18.</ref>

== Sports ==

Among the scenarios that the city has for the practice of football we mention the Universidad Nacional San Agustin Stadium, the [[Estadio Mariano Melgar|Mariano Melgar Stadium]], the stadium and the sticks Umacollo Stadium.

=== Soccer ===
The most popular sport is football in Arequipa, this sport is represented by the FBC Melgar club football, which participates in the Peruvian [[Peruvian Primera Divisi<U+00F3>n|First Division]] football, and who in 1981 was the first champion from the Peruvian interior.<ref name="almanaque2002">{{cite book |authorlink= http://www.inei.gob.pe |title=Almanaque de Arequipa 2002 |url=  |editor=INEI |page=169}}<!--|accessdate=3 August 2012--></ref> Among the historical clubs play football classic arequipe<U+00F1>o among them are:

== Culture ==
Arequipa culture is marked by the regionalist character of its inhabitants, Arequipa, unlike other big cities Peruvian mestizo and indigenous features has been highlighted as a "Spanish island in a sea indigenous" is the wellspring of juxtaposed positions, as a result the Arequipa regional profiles are more clearly defined than in the rest of Peru, while both culturally and geographically is described as a cultural and natural oasis<ref name="love4p">{{harv|Love|1995|p=4|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref> and is reaffirmed by the Ventura Travada documentation:

{{blockquote|<U+00AB>El n<U+00FA>mero de gentes de esta ciudad es apenas 30.000... los negros, mulatos y otros apenas llegan a 6000, todos los dem<U+00E1>s son espa<U+00F1>oles, muchos de ellos de conocida nobleza, porque esta ciudad es de las que sobresalen en el reino de gente espa<U+00F1>ola cuya sangre procuran no degenerar, celebrando muchos casamientos con espa<U+00F1>oles llamados huampos.

}}

Unlike other regional sentiments, Arequipa regionalist sentiment was connected to the fight with centralism:

{{blockquote|<U+00AB>En contraste con otros regionalismos peruanos, especialmente el del Cusco con su singular legado de haber sido la capital del Imperio Incaico, el sentimiento regionalista arequipe<U+00F1>o estaba conectado a la lucha contra la pol<U+00ED>tica centralista de crear un Estado moderno, alternativa cre<U+00ED>ble para el centralismo lime<U+00F1>o.

There are elements that have shaped the culture around Arequipa, a hallmark. His proud [[Regionalism (international relations)|regionalism]], expressed in numerous insurrections or revolutions that have earned him the nickname "City caudillo" or phrases like consecrate Jorge Basadre, "Arequipa is the gun pointed at the heart of Lima ', referring to the antagonism between both cities.<ref name="guillemete3p"/>

=== Dialect ===
An element of culture is its arequipe<U+00F1>a Castilian dialect that incorporates a distinctive rhythmic way of speaking, which usually prolong the last vowel of the final word in each sentence. The Castilian of Arequipa, also incorporates several Quechua words, besides the use of the [[Voseo|voseo.]]

==== Voseo ====
[[File:Mapa - Paises voseantes.png|thumb|285px|[419] [420] [421] [422]]]
All sources are agreed to the province of Arequipa as the representative area of the Peruvian voseo,<ref name="guajardo15p">{{harv|Guajardo Castro|2009|p=15|sp=s<U+00ED>}}</ref><ref name="carricaburo36p">{{harv|Carricaburo|1997|p=36|sp=si}}</ref> in general in Peru, the voseo is seen in rural areas bordering voseo areas except in Arequipa, where vosean speaking rural and urban areas,<ref name="voseoRAE">{{cite web |url=http://www.rae.es/dpd/?key=voseo |title=Diccionario Panhisp<U+00E1>nico de Dudas |accessdate=2 February 2009 |author=Real Academia Espa<U+00F1>ola de la Lengua |date=October |year=2005}}</ref> is to use archaic and recession, plus the use of single use of ''you,''  in Arequipa are used voseantes Chilean verb endings.<ref name="voseoRAE"/>

==== The loncco ====
It is a rural dialect of the city, has been largely lost due to migration from other provinces and the standardization of Castilian by the media in the capital, however, always in schools competitions are promoted lonccos poems.

{{Quote box|border=1px|align=left|quote=<poem style="margin-left: 4px">
Dicen que los Lonccos somos rudos y vulgares,

pero nunca nos quitaran nuestro modo de hablar.

The identity of Arequipa literature is linked to the early nineteenth-century libertarians. [[Mariano Melgar]] is, in that sense, a compulsory reference, as to the quality of his lyrics, his example and his vital attention to the themes and modes land drew the line that would guide the creative writing in his hometown. In the mid-nineteenth century, the poetic voices from Benito Bonifaz, Manuel Castillo, Jos<U+00E9> Mariano Llosa, Ignacio Gamio, among others, gave prestige to the letters Arequipa. Later that century, the novel George, the son of the village (1892), Maria Nieves and Bustamante, on the line of Victor Hugo, in the opinion of Luis Alberto Sanchez, gave us in his interesting 'Introduction', some signs preciosistas White City.

Poetry is heading towards the teaching of [[Manuel Gonz<U+00E1>lez Prada]] vibrant, and there are poems full of ideas and concepts Jorge Polar, philosopher and jurist, author of Arequipa. Description and social studies (1891), whose statement: "Years Arequipa has fought bravely to win free institutions for the Fatherland. Not born in vain at the foot of a volcano ", summarizes the feeling that inaugurated [[Mariano Melgar]] and that in one way or another, is present in Arequipa literature of the nineteenth and much of the twentieth, and the romantic voice of Francisco Mostajo, popular leader, who openly criticized the prevailing tone and advocated without success, the vital airs of modernism in its statements to the wind, 1908.

The twentieth century imposes rhythm and casually characteristic of youth. In this area appears Group The Coven, with distinctly modernist aspirations. Their representatives make up a generation varied, but a common concern for change. They are in their ranks: Percy Gibson, Cesar Rodriguez Atahualpa, and Renato Federico Morales Ag<U+00FC>ero Well Rivera. This group Arequipa, sort of "col<U+00F3>nidos" (Col<U+00F3>nida group of Lima, founded by [[Abraham Valdelomar]] in the decade of 10), to which are added the poets featured Alberto Guillen and Alberto Hidalgo latter a vanguard that has not yet received the recognition it deserves, assumes a freer language, away from the prevailing rhetoric and romantic. His affiliation would be closer to some avant-garde notions.

The gathering is organized in the halls, and the talents of the poets of the time are not indexed for arequipe<U+00F1>o masterfully, but [[Abraham Valdelomar|Valdelomar Abraham]], who evokes an evening of 1910 in the article "The throne of the sun. Notes of a journey." The Conde de Lemos highlights in it to Percy Gibson author of the verses of the famous waltz Melgar, who put music Benigno Ballon, who invites Col<U+00F3>nida write in the journal.

In this Gibson he published the poem "Democratic Gospel":

{{Quote box|border=1px|align=left|quote=<poem style="margin-left: 4px">

For its part, the paradoxes Tower (1926), Cesar Rodriguez Atahualpa, which pays homage to his homeland, as well as his "Song of Arequipa" (1918), set the tone of the regionalist pride to which we have referred at the beginning. This group accounted mamuel happened that Gallego Sanz, brothers Jorge and Xavier Bacacorzo and Guillermo Mercado (1904<U+2013>1983), the latter poet who started within indigenismo and published, among other books, Golden Soul (1925) A chullo of poems (1928) and Song of Sachaca (1940). The prose had its greatest exponent in the first half of the twentieth century, in the figure of Augusto Morales Aguirre (1888<U+2013>1957), who left as proof of his masterly novel The People of the sun (the first is around 1924), which managed continental resonance. His works include Dream Flower (1906) and Prayer (1913), poems, and Justice of Huayna Capac (1919), novel.

Scholar and journalist, Aguirre Morales worked in newspapers and Universal Chronicle. Among his contemporaries are Juan Manuel Osorio and Juan Manuel Polar. Later, Arequipa also produce a noted literary critic, internationally recognized, Enrique Cornejo Quea (1936<U+2013>1996) who applied the concept so sharply of "diversity" in American literary studies. Born in Arequipa in 1931, Oswaldo Reynoso released in 1961, "The innocent stories", and in 1964, the novel "In October there are no miracles, who have had multiple reprints. Owner of a poetic prose breath, then posted The beetle and man "(1970)", In search of Aladdin "(1993) and" The eunuchs immortal "(1995). But undoubtedly the most renowned Arequipa in the field of letters is [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (1936), [[Anexo:Premio Nobel de Literatura|Nobel Prize for Literature in 2010]] and author among other texts ''of the Hero''  (1964), ''The Green House''  (1966), ''The War of the End of the World'' (1981), ''The Feast of the Goat'' (2000) and inspired by the life of [[Flora Tristan]], ''The Paradise on the other corner'' (2003).
