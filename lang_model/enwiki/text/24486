===World Wrestling Federation===

==Personal life==
It is a common misconception that she is the daughter of professional wrestler Stan Mykietowich.<ref name=hof>{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBios/mcintyre.html|title=Canadian Hall of Fame: Velvet McIntyre|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2008-11-02}}</ref> Growing up, she had three brothers with whom she wrestled.<ref name=mem/>

McIntyre wore wrestling boots for the first four years of her career, but she later wrestled bare foot when someone took one of her boots as a joke, and she was forced to wrestle without them.<ref name=mem/> Wrestling barefoot later became one of her trademarks, as well as her high flying wrestling maneuvers.<ref name=mem/>

She retired from wrestling in 1998 after discovering she was pregnant, and she later gave birth to twins.<ref name=mem/><ref name=hof/> In her spare time, McIntyre makes and sells crafts.<ref name=mem/>
