'''''Pinnacle of Bedlam''''' is the seventh studio album by American [[death metal]] band [[Suffocation (band)|Suffocation]].  It is the band's first full length record since ''[[Pierced from Within]]'' to not feature [[Mike Smith (drummer)|Mike Smith]] (although he makes a guest appearance on the final track), instead the album features returning drummer [[Dave Culross]], making this his first full length record with Suffocation and his first release overall with the band since 1998's ''[[Despise the Sun]]''.  Track 10, 'Beginning of Sorrow', is a re-recording of the track of the same name from the album ''[[Breeding the Spawn]]''.

A limited edition release of the CD included a DVD containing the 75-minute documentary ''The Making of Pinnacle of Bedlam''.

In its first week the album sold about 3,200 copies and landed at the 152 position on the Billboard 200.
