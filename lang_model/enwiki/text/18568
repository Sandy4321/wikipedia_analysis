'''Marsha Blackburn''' (born [[June 6]], [[1952]] in [[Laurel, Mississippi]]) is a [[Tennessee]] [[politician]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], she represents [[Tennessee's 7th congressional district]], which stretches from the suburbs of [[Nashville]] to the suburbs of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. She is frequently mentioned as a possible Vice Presidential candidate for the GOP in 2008.

==Early career==
She graduated from [[Mississippi State University]] where she also spent a few summers working with the [[Southwestern Company]]. Blackburn now lives in [[Brentwood, Tennessee|Brentwood]], a suburb of Nashville. It is located in [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], the state's richest county and, since the 1980s, a Republican stronghold. A [[Mississippi]] native, she began her political career in 1977 as a founding member of the Williamson County Young Republicans. She served as chairwoman of the Williamson County Republican Party from 1989 to 1991.

Blackburn's elective political career began in 1992, when she won the Republican nomination for the 6th District, which at the time included her home in Brentwood. She lost by 16 points (under 3400 votes) to longtime congressman [[Bart Gordon]]. In 1995, she was appointed chairwoman of the Tennessee Film, Entertainment and Music Commission. She won elective office for the first time in 1998, when she was elected to the [[Tennessee State Senate]], representing Williamson County and a sliver of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]]. She led efforts to prevent the passage of a state [[income tax]] championed by Governor [[Don Sundquist]].

==House career==
Redistricting after the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]] moved Blackburn's home from the 6th District into the 7th District. In 2002, incumbent Congressman [[Ed Bryant]] decided to run for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] seat being vacated by [[Fred Thompson]]. Blackburn entered the Republican primary. The primary was watched very closely in Tennessee Republican circles. The 7th is considered the state's most Republican district outside the state's traditional Republican heartland, [[East Tennessee]]. Republicans had held the 7th since 1972 by margins rivaling those usually scored by East Tennessee Republicans. If possible, the 7th became even more Republican with the addition of Williamson County. It was virtually taken for granted that whoever won the Republican primary would be the district's next representative.

Of the four serious candidates, Blackburn was the only one from the Nashville suburbs, while the other three were all from Memphis and its suburbs. The three Memphians split the vote in that area, allowing Blackburn to win the primary by 20 points. Blackburn's primary win was tantamount to election in November. She was the fourth woman elected to Congress from Tennessee, but the first not to serve as a stand-in for her husband. ([[Irene Baker|Irene Bailey Baker]] and [[Louise Reece]] had served as [[caretaker government#Caretakers|caretaker]]s after their husbands died in office, and [[Marilyn Lloyd]] replaced her husband on the ballot when he died after the primary election.)

She was unopposed for reelection in 2004, which is somewhat unusual for a freshman member of Congress, even from a district as heavily Republican as the 7th. But ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'''s September 2004 [http://www.washingtonian.com/inwashington/bwcongress.html|''Best and Worst of Congress''], obtained from a survey of Congressional aides, identified Blackburn as one of the three best freshman members.

Blackburn is a staunch fiscal and social conservative, which is not surprising given the nature of her district. She is regarded as something of a "rising star" in Republican circles and is considered by some to have appreciably more influence than is typical of a three-term legislator. Despite this, she was defeated in November 2007 for the position of Republican Conference chairman. Some had speculated she would run for [[Bill Frist]]'s [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seat in 2006; however, she chose to run for a third House term. Unlike most female Representatives, she prefers to be called "Congressman Blackburn."

Given the 7th's strong Republican tilt, it is not likely that Blackburn will face substantive opposition in the near future. However, she is frequently mentioned as a possible candidate for governor in [[2010]].

According to her campaign website, Blackburn has received the following honors:
*[[National Journal]] described Blackburn as a "freshman to watch" and a "top House conservative" in 2003 and 2004.
*[[Americans for Tax Reform]] called Blackburn a "taxpayer hero" in 2003.
*The [[Family Research Council]] gave Blackburn the "true blue" award for the first half of the 108th Congress.
*[[National Right to Life Committee|National Right to Life]] praised Blackburn for supporting the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act.

==2008 Presidential election==
Congressman Blackburn initially backed former [[Massachusetts]] Governor [[Mitt Romney]]'s [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2008|presidential campaign]], joining his campaign as a senior advisor.<ref>http://www.mittromney.com/News/Press-Releases/Two_New_Senior_Advisers "Governor Mitt Romney Announces Two New Senior Advisers"</ref> On [[May 25]], [[2007]], Blackburn resigned her position in the Romney campaign and endorsed former Senator [[Fred Thompson]] for President.<ref>http://www.commercialappeal.com/mca/politics/article/0,1426,MCA_1496_5555307,00.html "Blackburn endorses Fred Thompson"</ref>

==Iraq Soldier Controversy==
On September 24, 2007, Blackburn was interviewed on Tucker, the news show of Tucker Carlson, which was being hosted by guest host David Shuster[http://www.memphisflyer.com/memphis/Content?oid=oid%3A33919]. When asked about her outrage behind the MoveOn.org Petraeus ad campaign, Blackburn accused the New York Times of "betraying the public trust". Using the public trust issue as a segue, Shuster then asked her for the name of the last soldier from her congressional district to be killed in Iraq. She was unable to answer.

Shuster afterward issued an on-air apology stating Jeremy Bohannon, the soldier Shuster claimed to be the last soldier from her district to be killed in Iraq, was not one of Rep. Blackburn's constituents [http://newsbusters.org/static/2007/08/2007-09-26MSNBCShuster.wmv], rather a constituent of Rep. [[John S. Tanner]][http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2007/sep/28/e28gotcha/].
