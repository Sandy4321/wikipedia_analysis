'''<U+00C9>owyn''' ([[Third Age|T.A.]] 2995 <U+2013> [[Fourth Age|F.A.]] ?), a '''[[Shieldmaiden]] of [[Rohan]]''', is a character in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[fantasy]] universe of [[Middle-earth]] who appears in his most famous work, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. She is also known as the '''Lady of the Shield-arm''', '''White Lady of Rohan''', and is later titled '''Lady of [[Ithilien]]''', also known as '''Lady of [[Emyn Arnen]]'''. Although she never carries the title of a princess, she is the sister of a Rohan king and the wife of a N<U+00FA>men<U+00F3>rean prince. <U+00C9>owyn was very beautiful; she was tall, slim, and graceful, with golden hair.  In temperament she was idealistic, spirited, brave, high-minded, and  lonely. 

==Portrayal in the books==
{{spoiler}}
In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' <U+00C9>owyn, Lady of Rohan, a daughter of the [[House of Eorl]] and the niece of King [[Th<U+00E9>oden]] of [[Rohan]], is introduced in [[Meduseld]], the king's hall at [[Edoras]]. She was the daughter of [[Th<U+00E9>odwyn]] (sister to Th<U+00E9>oden) and [[<U+00C9>omund]], and the sister of [[<U+00C9>omer]]. Frustrated by unrequited love for [[Aragorn]] and longing for the glory of battle, she disguised herself as a man, and under the alias of '''Dernhelm''', traveled with the Riders of Rohan to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] outside the White City of [[Minas Tirith]] in [[Gondor]], carrying with her [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], who was also ordered to remain.  Th<U+00E9>oden in fact named her as the ruler of [[Rohan]] in his and [[<U+00C9>omer]]'s absence when they went to attack the invading forces at [[Minas Tirith]] if they failed during the battle, when the Doorward [[H<U+00E1>ma]] recommended that "The House of Eorl" rule (Th<U+00E9>oden first only thought of male members), said that he and <U+00C9>omer are the last of the House, but H<U+00E1>ma points out <U+00C9>owyn, saying of her:

<blockquote>'' "There is <U+00C9>owyn, daughter of <U+00C9>omund, his sister. She is fearless and high-hearted. All love her. Let her be as lord to the Eorlingas, while we are gone."'' <U+2014>[[H<U+00E1>ma]]</blockquote>

During the battle of the [[Pelennor Fields]], she fought by King Th<U+00E9>oden; when he was injured by the [[Witch-king of Angmar]], Lord of the [[Nazg<U+00FB>l]], she and Merry scrambled to help him. Confronting the Witch-king, who boasted that "no living man may hinder me," she removed her helmet, exposing her long blond hair and declaring, 

:''"No living man am I! You look upon a woman."''

Just as [[Macduff (thane)|MacDuff]] disconcerted [[Macbeth]] by revealing he was not "of woman born", <U+00C9>owyn found the loophole in the 1,000-year-old [[prophecy]] by the Elf-lord [[Glorfindel]], foretelling that the Witch-king would not be slain by a man.

<U+00C9>owyn slew the Witch-king after Merry stabbed him behind the knee. Strictly speaking, Merry is also "no man," being a [[Hobbit]]. However, the stab behind the knee likely would not have been fatal, even if it did break the bonds that "bent his unseen sinews to his will."  The consensus is that Merry's stab made the Witch-King vulnerable while Eowyn's slash actually resulted in death. She was granted the title "Lady of the Shield-arm" after the Battle in recognition of her triumph over the Witch-king.

<U+00C9>owyn was severely injured in this fight, and because of the poisonous effect of the Black Breath of the Nazg<U+00FB>l and her hopeless love for Aragorn, she faced near-certain death and was brought up to the [[Houses of Healing]]. However, she was treated in time by Aragorn, to whom she had earlier been strongly attracted,  during his brief rest in [[Minas Tirith]]. Since she did not yet recover completely, she could not join Aragorn's army on its way to [[Mordor]] for the last confront with the enemy's army. However, while recuperating in the Houses of Healing, she met [[Faramir]], with whom she fell in love.  

After the demise of [[Sauron]], the happily-wedded couple settled in [[Ithilien]], of which Faramir was made the ruling Prince by King Aragorn. <U+00C9>owyn was known as the Lady of Ithilien. <U+00C9>owyn's brother <U+00C9>omer became the King of Rohan. Faramir and <U+00C9>owyn had at least one son (likely Elboron), and their grandson was [[Barahir]], who wrote ''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]'' in the [[Fourth Age]].  The date of Eowyn's death is nowhere recorded.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
[[Image:Eowyn_dragon.PNG|left|thumb|frame|<U+00C9>owyn faces down the Witch-king's [[fell beast]] in the film of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film)|The Return of the King]]''.]] 
The voice of <U+00C9>owyn was provided by [[Nellie Bellflower]] in the [[1980]] [[Rankin/Bass]] animated version of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'', and by Elin Jenkins in [[BBC Radio]]'s [[1981]] [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio adaptation)|serialisation]].

<U+00C9>owyn also appears briefly in [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s 1978 adaptation but does not have any dialogue.

In [[Peter Jackson]]'s films ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)|The Two Towers]]'' ([[2002 in film|2002]]) and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film)|The Return of the King]]'' ([[2003 in film|2003]]), <U+00C9>owyn is played by [[Miranda Otto]].  She was apparently promised to [[Gr<U+00ED>ma]] by [[Saruman]] in payment for being the wizard's spy in the royal court (as in the book). In the extended edition of ''The Two Towers,'' <U+00C9>owyn is shown discovering, to her astonishment, that Aragorn is a long-lived [[D<U+00FA>nedain|D<U+00FA>nadan]].

In the original theatrical release of ''Return of the King'', <U+00C9>owyn's injuries after fighting the Witch-king are less severe than in the novel: she is conscious but hurt, as opposed to unconscious. In scenes added in the Extended Edition of the film, she '''is''' near death:  her brother finds her and grieves, and later we see her being healed by Aragorn.

While she does disguise herself in the film to ride into battle, she never takes on the name "Dernhelm," and the audience is always aware of her true identity. The production team stated that while in a book it was easy to disguise Eowyn's identity, in the medium of cinema the audience could visually tell that it was her and it would have strained the credibility of the scenes to try to make it a secret, as well as make Merry look foolish.)

==Trivia==
*<U+00C9>owyn means "horse lover" or "friend of horses" in [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] (the language Tolkien used to represent [[Rohirric]]). [[Ehwaz|Eoh]]- meaning "horse" and -[[Wynn|wyn]] meaning "joy". A corresponding Greek name would be ''[[Philippa]]''.
*The first syllable of Lady <U+00C9>owyn's name sounds like "eh-ah," with the "ah" just barely pronounced. As in [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]], the y in the second syllable is the same sound as the German letter ''<U+00FC>'' or the French ''u''. The actors in the [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|Lord of the Rings movie trilogy]] consistently pronounce her name as well as the names of [[<U+00C9>omer]] and [[Th<U+00E9>oden]] in a manner inconsistent with most reconstructions of [[Old English language|Old English]] pronunciation.
<!-- The name <U+00C9>owyn comes from an old Welsh name, <U+00D8>wyn. It has been slightly altered to sound like A-O-win.  Contrary to what others may believe, <U+00C9>owyn is pronounced properly in the recent Peter Jackson adaptation of the Books by J. R. R. Tolkien. Many names in The Lord of the Rings and other related works are adapted from ancient names in ancient mythology. My name is <U+00C9>owyn, and it means "Horse friend". The prefix <U+00C9>o- meaning 'horse' and the suffix -wyn meaning 'friend.'
