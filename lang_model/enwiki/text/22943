:''Not to be confused with the [[East and West Junction Railway]], or [[East and West Yorkshire Junction Railway]]''
The '''York, Hull and East and West Yorkshire Junction Railway''' was a proposed railway line, promoted in the mid 1840s, intended to connect York to the East Riding of Yorkshire.

The line was not built, instead an alternative proposal, the  [[York and North Midland Railway]]'s [[York to Beverley Line|York to Beverley line]] gained parliamentary approval in 1846, and was opened in two sections in 1847 and 1865.

==History==
The railway line, proposed during the [[Railway Mania]], planned to connect to the proposed ''[[Leeds and York Railway]]'' at York, and serve destinations in the eastern [[Vale of York]] and [[East Riding of Yorkshire]]. From York the line was to run east to [[Pocklington]], [[Market Weighton]], and [[Beverley]], then to the new East Docks ([[Victoria Dock, Hull|Victoria Dock]]) in [[Kingston upon Hull]]. Branches from the line were planned to [[Selby]], [[Driffield]], and [[Hornsea]].{{sfn|Tomlinson|1915|pp=464-466}}{{sfn|York and North Midland Railway Company|1849|loc=114, cols.1-2}}

The ''York, Hull and East and West Yorkshire Junction Railway Company'' was provisionally registered in 1845,<ref>{{citation|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7hRcAAAAQAAJ&pg=PR56#v=onepage&q&f=false| title = Report of the Registrar of Joint-Stock Companies to the Committee of Privy Council for Trade| year = 1845}}</ref> and the line, together with the [[Leeds and York Railway]] was supported by the [[Manchester and Leeds Railway]].{{sfn|Tomlinson|1915|pp=464-466}} 

The route invaded an area which at that time was exclusively served by the [[York and North Midland Railway]] (Y&NMR), and passed through an area which had already been surveyed for a railway by the Y&NMR.{{sfn|Tomlinson|1915|pp=464-466}} In an attempt to preserve its [[monopoly]] the Y&NMR developed a scheme for a line between Selby to Driffield and put bills for both the York-Market Weighton-Beverley, and Selby-Market-Weighton lines before parliament in 1845/6,{{sfn|Hoole|1986|p=53}}<ref>{{citation| journal = The London Gazette| date = 29 November 1845| issue = 20545| pages = 6659|title= York and North Midland Railway. East Riding Branches| url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/20545/page/6659}}</ref> also bringing forward a line to Hornsea and a branch in Hull to the new docks.{{sfn|York and North Midland Railway Company|1849|loc=114, cols.1-2}} The York and Hull company also initiated its bill in 1845, with the line from York to Hull, and its branches to Hornsea, Driffield and Selby.<ref>[[#lg1845|London Gazette]] (15 Nov 1845)</ref>

The Y&NMR's parliamentary proposals were successful, resulting in the ''''York and North Midland Rly. (East Riding Branches) [No.1] Act'' of 1846,{{#tag:ref|'''York and North Midland Rly. (East Riding Branches) [No.1] Act, 1846 (Cap. 65)''' ; An Act for enabling the ''York and North Midland'' Railway to make certain branch Railways in the East Riding of the county of ''York''; and for other purposes.''<ref name="use">{{citation| url =http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ywHKfmez9ggC&pg=RA1-PA92#v=onepage&q&f=false| work = The British Almanac of the Society for the diffusion of useful Knowledge| year = 1847| chapter = 4.
