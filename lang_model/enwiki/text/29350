'''Robert Storm Petersen''' ([[19 September]] [[1882]]<U+2013>[[6 March]] [[1949]]) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[cartoonist]], [[writer]], [[animator]], [[illustrator]], [[painting|painter]] and [[humorist]]. He is known almost exclusively by his [[pen name]] '''Storm P'''.

==Biography==
He was the son of a butcher and grew up in [[Copenhagen]] in a lower middle class/worker<U+2019>s milieu whose [[jargon]] is felt in much of his writings. After an interrupted study on the Academy of Art, he worked as a free-lance painter, illustrator and [[cabaret]] entertainer. Already during [[World War I]] he was a well-known artist, and from about 1920 onward he was almost a national <U+201C>institution<U+201D> as a humorist, partly because of his versatile interests. He was for many years connected to the Copenhagen newspaper <U+201C>Berlingske Tidende<U+201D> as a comic writer and cartoonist.

As a humorist, Storm P. is related to British and [[United States|American]] humour, with a strong touch of craziness and absurdity. However, he is less marked by total nonsense than, for instance, [[Lewis Carroll]]. Often his starting point is a plain Copenhagen jargon, combined with a Danish down-to-earth homespun [[philosophy]] and all kinds of cosy fun and comedy; the <U+201C>little<U+201D> man<U+2019>s unimpressed comments on a crazy world.

Though normally loved by most of his countrymen, Storm P. has also been criticised for being too toothless, cosy and [[petit bourgeois]]. In spite of his social background and interest of poor milieus, he very seldom shows deeper social criticism or [[revolutionary]] opinions; the dramatic age in which he lived left rather small stamps on his work. On the other hand he was no staunch giggler; many of his paintings deal with death, sorrow and [[macabre]] themes. Though not a revolutionary, he has indeed painted the victims of social injustice and misery, often with a strong touch of [[compassion]]. [[Melancholy]] and fear are not unknown to him, but his official appearance was an optimistic one.

1977 a "Storm P. Museum" was opened. In 1982 he was [[List of people on stamps of Denmark|featured on a Danish stamp]].

==Drawings and paintings==
Storm P. left about 60,000 drawings and 100 paintings of varied quality. His drawings are very often illustrated jokes, or series of a theme besides artist sketches. Among his favourite themes are the [[vagabond]]s - who are portrayed as grotesquely dressed-up petty philosophers - and the [[circus]] milieu that he regarded with much warmth. He is best known for his [[Storm P machines]], which are comic drawings of machines that perform very simple tasks through an unnecessarily complex series of actions. Other cartoonists who are known for similar machine drawings are [[Rube Goldberg]] and [[Heath Robinson]]. Besides that, he illustrated many books, often written by congenial authors--among others [[Mark Twain]], [[Jerome K. Jerome]] and [[G. K. Chesterton]].

As a painter he is clearly influed by names like [[Edvard Munch]] and [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], but often with an independent [[Na<U+00EF>ve art|naivist]] touch. Later on, [[Paul Klee]] and [[Wassili Kandinsky]] seem to have been an inspiration in spite of his often outspoken ridiculing of modern art. Among his many themes are exterieurs from [[Paris]], from prostitution milieus and nature scenes. ''La Morgue'' (1906) and ''Kultur'' (1908, <U+201C>Culture<U+201D>) are two of his most well known paintings.

==The Author==
As an '''author''' he wrote many [[short-stories]] and tales, often parodies on detective stories or melodramas, small cosy snap-shots from the Copenhagen lower middle class milieu, crazy tales or, especially, <U+201C>[[monologues]]<U+201D> put into the mouth of bums, artists, etc. Special kinds of tales were the monologues put into the mouth of his own dog (the ''Grog, My Dog-tales'' 1926-1935), in which he let the dog reflect on life, death and daily life, sometimes with a light touch of sadness and pity within the humour.

==Comics==
Storm P is also well known in Denmark as the author of a number of [[comics]] (titles in [[Danish language|Danish]]):

* ''[[De tre sm<U+00E5> m<U+00E6>nd og nummermanden]]'' (The three little Men and the Number Man) 1913-1923 is a play with situations: three little men making mad pranks leading to success or failure, all accompanied by an even smaller man who delivers the numbers of the strip.
*''[[En underlig Mand]]'' ("A strange Man") from the 1930s was an [[absurd]] strip cartoon about a man who reacts illogically and solves problems in an unexpected way.
* ''[[Peter og Ping]]'' ("Peter and Ping"), 1922-1949 was his greatest success, a comic strip about a small citizen and his friend (or adopted son) Ping, a speaking penguin. Their experiences in [[Copenhagen]], spiced by Ping<U+2019>s absurd expressions and jokes, were extremely popular and even led to the foundation of a Ping Club for [[children]]. It also caused some international attention and was sold to [[Great Britain]]. 
* ''[[Dagens flue]] ''("The Daily Fly") that started in 1939 were drawings illustrating humorous philosophical jokes which often contained a deeper meaning.

==The Actor==
Finally, Storm P. played a minor role in acting. As a free-lance actor he had several roles in early Danish [[silent movies]], and later on occasionally acted in comedies on theatres to supplement his work as an entertainer. As a curiosity, it might be mentioned that he created the first Danish [[animated cartoon]] (with the Three Little Men) in 1920. As a decorator he delivered scenery to ballets and plays.

==Quotes==
*Life is a circus: you go in, bend, run around, bend again and leave.
*<U+2013> What is your opinion of the world situation? <U+2013> Nothing, something got in my eye.
* There is something fishy about art that needs to be explained.
* We human beings are strange creatures <U+2013> we have to go underground because we have invented the aeroplane. (1939)
