'''George Robert "Bob" Newhart''' (born [[September 5]], [[1929]] in [[Oak Park, Illinois]]) is a Golden Globe Award-winning, Grammy Award-winning [[United States|American]] [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] and [[actor]].

== Early life ==
Bob Newhart was born in [[Oak Park, Illinois]]  to George David Newhart and Julia Pauline Burns, both of whom were devout [[Catholics]]. A sister, M. Joan Newhart, is a Roman Catholic nun.  Newhart is of Irish and German descent. 

Newhart attended [[St. Ignatius College Prep]] and graduated in [[1952]] from [[Loyola University Chicago]] with a business degree.  He was drafted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], and served stateside during the [[Korean War]] until discharged in [[1954]].

== Early career ==
After the war he got a job as an [[accountant]] for [[United States Gypsum]]. He later claimed that his motto, "That's close enough," shows he didn't have the temperament to be an accountant. He also claimed to have been a clerk in the [[unemployment]] office who made $60 a week but who quit upon learning weekly unemployment benefits were $55 a week and "they only had to come in to the office one day a week to collect it." In [[1958]] he became an advertising [[copywriter]] for [[Fred A. Niles]], a major independent film and television producer in Chicago.  It was at the company that he and a coworker would entertain each other in long telephone calls which they would record then send to a radio station as audition tapes.  When his coworker ended his participation, Newhart continued the recordings alone, developing the [[shtick]] which was to serve him well for decades. In addition to his various standup bits, he incorporated that shtick into his television series at appropriate times.

== Stand-up comedy albums ==
The auditions led to his break-through recording contract. A disc jockey at the radio station -- Dan Sorkin, who later became the announcer-sidekick on his NBC series -- introduced Newhart to the head of talent at [[Warner Bros. Records]], which signed him only a year after the label was formed, based solely on those recordings. He expanded his material into a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up routine]] which he began to perform at nightclubs.  

Newhart became famous mostly on the strength of his audio releases, in which he became the world's first solo "straight man."  This is a seeming contradiction in terms--by definition, a straight man is the counterpart of a more loony comedic partner. Newhart's routine, however, was simply to portray one end of a phone call, playing the straightest of comedic straight men and implying what he was hearing on the other end of the phone. 

Newhart told a 2005 interviewer for [[PBS]]'s ''[[American Experience]]'' that his favorite standup routine is "Abe Lincoln vs. Madison Avenue," in which a slick promoter has to deal with the reluctance of the eccentric President to agree to efforts to boost his image. The routine was suggested to Newhart by a Chicago TV director and future comedian -- [[Bill Daily]], who would be Newhart's castmate on the 1970s ''Bob Newhart Show'' for [[CBS]].

Newhart was known for using an intentional stammer, in service of his unique combination of politeness and disbelief at what he was supposedly hearing.

His [[1960]] comedy album, ''[[The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart]]'', went straight to number one on the charts, beating [[Elvis Presley]] and the cast album of ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. ''Button Down Mind'' received the [[Grammy Awards of 1961|1961 Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]].  Newhart also won [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]], and his quickly-released follow-on album, ''The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back'', won [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album|Best Comedy Performance - Spoken Word]] that same year.

Subsequent comedy albums include ''Behind the Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart'' (1961), ''The Button-Down Mind on TV'' (1962), ''Bob Newhart Faces Bob Newhart (1964)'', ''The Windmills Are Weakening'' (1965), ''This Is It'' (1967), ''Best of Bob Newhart'' (1971), and ''Very Funny Bob Newhart'' (1973).  

Years later he released ''Bob Newhart Off the Record'' (1992), ''The Button-Down Concert'' (1997) and ''Something Like This'' (2001), an anthology of his 1960s Warner Bros. albums.

== Television ==
Newhart's success in stand-up led to his own [[NBC]] [[variety show]] in [[1961 in television|1961]], ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''. The show lasted a single season, yet earned Newhart an [[Emmy Award]] nomination and a [[Peabody Award]]. The Peabody Board cited him as:
:a person whose gentle satire and wry and irreverent wit waft a breath of fresh and bracing air through the stale and stuffy electronic corridors. A merry marauder, who looks less like [[Saint George#The legend of George and the Dragon|St. George]] than a choirboy, Newhart has wounded, if not slain, many of the dragons that stalk our society. In a troubled and apprehensive world, Newhart has proved once again that laughter is the best medicine.

In the mid-[[1960s]], Newhart appeared on ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' 24 times, and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' eight times. He appeared in a [[1963 in television|1963 episode]] of ''[[List of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour episodes|The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]''.

Newhart guest hosted ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' 87 times, and hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' twice, in [[1980 in television|1980]] and again in [[1995 in television|1995]]. 

=== Sitcoms ===
Newhart's most notable exposure on television came from two long running programs centering around him. From [[1972]] to [[1978]], Newhart starred in the popular ''[[The Bob Newhart Show|Bob Newhart Show]]'' on [[CBS]] in which he played a Chicago psychologist and husband of Emily, played by co-star [[Suzanne Pleshette]]. In [[1982]], Newhart returned to primetime with a new sitcom, ''[[Newhart]]'', on [[CBS]], co-starring [[Mary Frann]].  

The two shows have a connection: when ''[[Newhart]]'' went off the air in [[1990]], it ended with a scene (met by screams of laughter from the studio audience) in which Newhart wakes up in bed with his wife from "The Bob Newhart Show".  He realizes (in a satire of a famous plot element in the TV series ''[[Dallas (TV series)|Dallas]]'' a few years earlier) that the entire ''Newhart'' series was a nightmare provoked by "eating too much Japanese food before going to bed," as the final ''Newhart'' episode had him selling his country inn to Japanese investors. Recalling Mary Frann's buxom figure and her choice of clothing, Bob closes the segment and the series by telling Emily, "You should really wear more sweaters." before the typical closing notes of the old ''Bob Newhart Show'' theme played over the fadeout.

In [[1992]], Newhart returned to television with a series called ''Bob'', about a [[cartoonist]]. An ensemble cast included a pre-''[[Friends]]'' [[Lisa Kudrow]], but the show did not develop a strong audience and was off the air two years later. 

In [[1997]], Newhart returned again with ''[[George and Leo]]'' on [[CBS]] with [[Judd Hirsch]] and [[Jason Bateman]]; the show was canceled during its first season.

=== Other appearances ===
In 2001, Bob made an appearance on MAD TV (Season 6), playing a psychiatrist who yells "Stop it!" in a very memorable skit.

His other television work includes:

*''[[The Entertainers]]'' (regular performer in [[1964]])
*''[[Thursday's Game]]'' ([[1974]])
*''Marathon'' ([[1980]])
*''[[Ladies and Gentlemen... Bob Newhart]]'' ([[1980]])
*''[[Ladies and Gentlemen... Bob Newhart Part II]]'' ([[1981]])
*''[[The Entertainers]]'' ([[1991]])
*''[[The Simpsons]]'' ([[1996]])
*''[[In and Out]]'' ([[1997]])
*''[[The Sports Pages]]'' ([[2001]])
*''[[The Librarian: Quest for the Spear]]'' ([[2004]])
*''[[The Librarian: Return to King Solomon's Mines]]'' ([[2006]])

He guest-starred on ''[[ER (television)|ER]]'' in a rare dramatic role that earned him an [[Emmy Award]] nomination, his first in nearly 20 years. In [[2005 in television|2005]] he began a recurring role in ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as Morty, the on-again/off-again boyfriend of Sophie ([[Lesley Ann Warren]]), Susan Mayer's ([[Teri Hatcher]]) mother.

His most recent appearance was on the 2006 [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] hosted by [[Conan O'Brien]]. He was a part of a gag in which he was placed in an air tight glass prison that contained 3 hours of air. If the Emmys went over the time of 3 hours, he would die. This gag was an acknowledgment of the common frustration that award shows usually run on past their allotted time (which is usually three hours).

=== Newhart as author ===
On [[September 20]], [[2006]], Hyperion Books released Newhart's first book, ''I Shouldn't Even Be Doing This''. The book is primarily a memoir, but features comic bits by Newhart as well. As comedian [[David Hyde Pierce]] notes, "The only difference between Bob Newhart on stage and Bob Newhart offstage &ndash; is that there is no stage."

== Persona ==
Newhart is known for his [[deadpan]] delivery and a slight [[Stuttering|stammer]] which early on he incorporated into the persona around which he built a successful career. On his TV shows, although he got his share of funny lines, often he worked in the [[Jack Benny]] tradition of being the "straight man" while the sometimes somewhat bizarre cast members surrounding him got the laughs.

Several of his funniest bits involve hearing one half of a conversation as he spoke to someone over the phone. For example, in a routine called ''King Kong'', a rookie security guard at the [[Empire State Building]] seeks guidance as to how to deal with an ape who is "18 to 19 stories high, depending on whether we have a 13th floor or not". He assures his boss he has looked in the guards manual "under 'ape' and 'ape's toes'". Other famous routines include "The Driving Instructor," "The Mrs. Grace L. Ferguson Airline (and Storm Door Company)", "Introducing Tobacco To Civilization", and "Abe Lincoln's Press Secretary".

==Filmography==
Two of Newhart's most memorable roles were in two very different military-themed films, the [[1962 in film|1962 film]] ''[[Hell Is for Heroes (film)|Hell Is for Heroes]]'' (where he provided some comic relief using his man-on-the-telephone routine), and his portrayal of [[Major Major Major Major]] in the [[1970 in film|1970 film version]] of ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch-22]]''.

He also appeared in:
*''[[Hot Millions]]'' ([[1968]])
*''[[On a Clear Day You Can See Forever]]'' ([[1970]])
*''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch-22]]'' ([[1970]])
*''[[Cold Turkey (film)|Cold Turkey]]'' ([[1971]])
*''[[The Rescuers]]'' ([[1977]]) (voice)
*''[[Little Miss Marker]]'' ([[1980]])
*''[[First Family]]'' ([[1980]])
*''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' ([[1990]]) (voice)
*''[[In & Out]]'' ([[1997]])
*''[[Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde]]'' ([[2003]])
*''[[Elf (movie)|Elf]]'' ([[2003]])

==Honors==
In addition to his Peabody Award and several Emmy nominations, Newhart's recognitions include the following:
*Three [[Grammy Awards of 1961|Grammy awards in 1961]]: Best New Artist, Best Comedy Performance (Spoken Word) and Album of the Year for ''The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart''.
*In [[1993 in television|1993]] Newhart was inducted into the [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] Hall of Fame.
*In [[1998]], [[Billboard magazine|''Billboard'' magazine]] recognized Newhart's first album as #20 on their list of [[Billboard 200|most popular albums]] of the past 40 years, and the only comedy album on the list.
*On [[January 6]], [[1999]] Newhart received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. 
*In [[2002]] he won the [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]].
*In [[2004]], Newhart was #14 on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the [[100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time]].
*On [[July 27]], [[2004]], the [[United States|American]] [[cable television]] network [[TV Land]] unveiled a statue of Newhart on the [[Magnificent Mile]] in his native Chicago, depicting Dr. Robert Hartley from ''The Bob Newhart Show''.  The statues depict Dr. Hartley sitting in his therapy practice chair with a pencil held between his hands, and a patients' sofa next to him. The bronze set is now located in the small park in front of the entrance of [[Navy Pier]].

== Personal life ==
Newhart was introduced by [[Buddy Hackett]] to Virginia "Ginnie" Quinn, the daughter of late character actor Bill Quinn. She became his wife on [[January 12]], [[1963]]. The couple have four children (Robert, Timothy, Jennifer, and Courtney), and several grandchildren.  His son Rob (who portrayed his father in 1993's ''Heart & Souls'', with [[Robert Downey Jr.]]) maintains his father's official website.

Newhart and his wife are good friends with comedian [[Don Rickles]] and Rickles' wife, Barbara, and the couples often vacation together. Newhart and Rickles appeared together on [[The Tonight Show]] with [[Jay Leno]] on January 24, 2005, the Monday following [[Johnny Carson]]'s death, reminiscing about their many guest appearances on Carson's show.

== Trivia ==
*The final scene of the final episode of ''Newhart'' introduced a technique that is sometimes known as "breaking the fifth wall" &mdash; an analogy with [[fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]] in which the fifth wall becomes the convention that two television characters could not be the same person. The idea for that scene came from Newhart's wife. This technique occurred again, briefly, in an episode of [[Married... with Children]] when the character of Jefferson D'Arcy (played by [[Ted McGinley]], who had previous portrayed supporting characters on [[Happy Days]] and [[The Love Boat]]) initially responded to [[Married... with Children]] lead character [[Al Bundy]] as "[[Fonzie]]", then "Captain Stubing", before correctly addressing him as "Al".
*During Newhart's television career he repeatedly resisted playing a father. When presented with a script of ''The Bob Newhart Show'' in which his character's wife was revealed to be pregnant, Newhart's response to the writers about the script was "Suzanne and I love the script, but who are you going to get to play Bob?"
*His stand up comedy routines are famous for being one-sided conversations, in which he has a conversation with someone, but only his side of the conversation is heard by the audience.
*Whenever Newhart was asked whom he admired the most as a comedian, he never hesitated with his somewhat surprising answer: [[Richard Pryor]]. Upon Pryor's death in 2005, Newhart paid tribute by calling him "the seminal comedian of the last 50 years."
*Like [[Bill Cosby]], Newhart seldom uses [[profanity]] for humorous effect. The closest Newhart comes is in his bit "The Driving Instructor," where he makes an attempt at a joke with an angry pedestrian, and then merely echoes the unseen/unheard pedestrian by saying, "No, I don't suppose it ''is'' so damn funny." Another time, in "Hangover" he alluded to a cuss word. His hung over character asks what his wife's cooking for dinner. After a pause, he retches and replies "Honey, will you call it creamed chipped beef on toast, please?" (suggesting his wife said "[[shit on a shingle]]").
*During the 70s, teenagers and college kids would play a drinking game while watching the Bob Newhart Show. Everytime someone said, "Hi Bob," people were required to take a drink.
