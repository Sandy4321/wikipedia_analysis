The '''''Roon'' class''' was a pair of [[armored cruiser]]s built for the [[Kaiserliche Marine|German Imperial Navy]] after the turn of the 20th century. The class comprised {{SMS|Roon||2}} and {{SMS|Yorck||2}}, which closely resembled the earlier [[Prinz Adalbert class armored cruiser|''Prinz Adalbert'' class]] ships, but incorporated slight incremental improvements. The ships were easily distinguished from their predecessors by the addition of a fourth funnel. Like all of the armored cruisers built by Germany, they were intended to serve as station ships in Germany's overseas possessions. The ships did not compare well with their British rivals.

The two ships served with the [[High Seas Fleet]] in the reconnaissance squadrons after they joined the fleet in 1905&ndash;1906. At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, the ships served alongside the more powerful [[battlecruiser]]s of the [[I Scouting Group]]. While returning to port after a [[Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby|raid of the English coast]] on 16 December 1914, ''Yorck'' struck German mines and sank with heavy loss of life. ''Roon'' was disarmed in 1916 and intended to be converted into a [[seaplane carrier]], though this was never carried out. The ship was eventually broken up for scrap in 1921

==Design==
Design work on ''Roon'' and her sistership ''Yorck'' was completed in 1901.<ref name=G51>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 51</ref> The design for the ''Roon'' class can be traced back to the first German armored cruiser, {{SMS|F<U+00FC>rst Bismarck|1896|2}}, built between 1896-1900, and the preceding [[Victoria Louise class protected cruiser|''Victoria Louise'' class]] of [[protected cruiser]]s that came before it. The German armored cruisers were designed for overseas service, specifically to serve as station ships in the German colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.<ref name="Conways 142">Gardiner & Gray, p. 142</ref> 

''Roon'' and her sister ''Yorck'' were improved versions of the preceding ''Prinz Adalbert'' class. The two ships German armored cruisers were slightly larger and faster than the ''Prinz Adalbert'' class and had a slightly different armor layout; the ''Roon'' class ships had thinner armor on the turret faces, and slightly thinner armored decks.<ref name=C1860255>Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 255</ref>  They shared many of the same layout characteristics as the contemporary German [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s, including a smaller main armament but heavier secondary battery than their foreign equivalents. As a result, they likewise compared unfavorably with their British contemporaries.<ref>Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 249</ref> 

===General characteristics===
The ships of the ''Roon'' class were {{convert|127.3|m|ft|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|127.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[length overall|overall]]. They had a beam of {{convert|20.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a draft of {{convert|7.76|m|ft|abbr=on}}. ''Roon'' and ''Yorck'' displaced {{convert|9533|MT|sp=us}} normally,<ref>Seligmann, p. 20</ref> and {{convert|10266|MT|sp=us}} at full load. Their [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]s were constructed from transverse and longitudinal steel frames that formed a structure over which the steel hull plates were [[rivet]]ed. The hulls contained 12 [[watertight compartment]]s and a [[double bottom]] that ran for 60&nbsp;percent of the length of the ship.<ref name=G51/> 

Like the preceding ''Prinz Adalbert'' class ships, ''Roon'' and ''Yorck'' were good sea boats; when the fuel bunkers were full they had a gentle motion. They also maneuvered well and were responsive to the helm. With the [[rudder]] hard over, the ships lost up to 60&nbsp;percent speed. The ships' casemates were placed too low, and as a result they were exceedingly wet.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 50&ndash;52</ref> They had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|1.04|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Their standard complements numbered some 35 officers and 598 enlisted men. While serving as a squadron flagship the crew was augmented by 13 officers and 62 men, and as a second command ship 9 officers and 44 sailors were added to the standard crew.<ref name=G52>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 52</ref>

===Propulsion===
''Roon'' and ''Yorck'' were powered by the same engine system as the preceding class, which consisted of three 3-cylinder vertical [[triple expansion engine]]s, each of which drove one of the ships' three [[screw propeller|screws]]. The central screw was {{convert|4.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter while the outer screws were {{convert|4.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide.<ref name=G512/> Steam was provided to the engines by 16 D<U+00FC>rr boilers built by D<U+00FC>sseldorf-Ratinger R<U+00F6>hrenkesselfabrik. Each boiler had 4 fireboxes apiece for a total of 48. The propulsion system produced {{convert|19000|ihp|abbr=on}}, which delivered a top speed of {{convert|21|kn|km/h}}. The ships both had four turbo generators, which provided 260&nbsp;kilowatts at 110&nbsp;volts. The ships both had a single rudder.<ref name=G51/>

===Armament===
The ships' primary armament consisted of four {{convert|21|cm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} SK L/40 guns mounted two twin turrets, one fore and one aft.<ref group=Note>In Imperial German Navy gun nomenclature, "SK" (''Schnellfeuerkanone'') denotes that the gun is quick firing, while the L/40 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/40 gun is 40 [[Calibers#Caliber_as_measurement_of_length|calibers]], meaning that the gun is 40 times long as it is in diameter.</ref> These guns fired a {{convert|108|kg|lb|adj=on}} armored-piercing shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|780|m|ft|sp=us}} per second, for a maximum range of {{convert|12300|m|yd|abbr=on}} with their original maximum elevation of 16 degrees. The guns were later improved to 30 degrees, which extended the maximum range to {{convert|16200|m|yd|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Conways 140">Gardiner & Gray, p. 140</ref>

Secondary armament included ten {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK L/40 guns in single turrets and casemates and fourteen {{convert|8.8|cm|in|adj=on}} SK L/35 guns, also casemated. The 15&nbsp;cm guns fired a {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on}} per second. The guns could be elevated to 30 degrees, which provided a maximum range of {{convert|13900|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The 8.8&nbsp;cm guns fired a {{convert|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|770|m|ft|abbr=on}} per second. These guns had a maximum elevation of 25&nbsp;degrees and a range of {{convert|9100|m|yd|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Conways 140"/> The ships were also equipped with four {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes.<ref name=G512>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 50&ndash;51</ref>

This armament was identical to that on the preceding [[Prinz Adalbert class armored cruiser|''Prinz Adalbert'' class]],<ref>O'Brien p. 18</ref> with the exception of ammunition stores. The ''Roon'' class ships carried 380 shells for the main battery, 1,600 rounds for the 15&nbsp;cm guns, and 2,100 shells for the 8.8&nbsp;cm guns. The planned conversion for ''Roon'' to a seaplane carrier called for six 15&nbsp;cm L/45 guns and six 8.8&nbsp;cm Flak guns, with 2,400 rounds, though this was never carried out.<ref name=G51/>

===Armor===
''Roon'' and ''Yorck'' were protected by [[Krupp]] [[Krupp cemented steel|cemented steel armor]]. At the waterline, their [[armored belt]] was {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick amidships were the ships' vitals were located. This was decreased slightly to {{convert|80|mm|in|abbr=on}} on either ends of the central section of the belt. The belt was backed by {{convert|55|mm|in|abbr=on}} of [[teak]] planking. At the casemate deck the side armor was also 100&nbsp;mm thick. Their armored deck ranged in thickness from {{convert|40|-|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} and was connected to the belt by sloped armor that was {{convert|40|-|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=G512/>

The forward [[conning tower]] had {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick sides and a {{convert|30|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick roof. The rear conning tower was less well-protected; its sides were only 80&nbsp;mm thick and its roof was {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=G51/> The main battery gun turrets were armored with 150&nbsp;mm thick steel plates on the sides and 30&nbsp;mm thick roofs. The 15&nbsp;cm turrets were protected by 100&nbsp;mm thick sides and 80&nbsp;mm thick gun shields.<ref name=G512/>

==Construction==
''Roon'' was laid down in 1902 at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|Kiel Navy dockyard]]. She was launched on 27 June 1903 and completed on 5 April 1906, at the cost of 15,345,000 [[German gold mark|marks]]. ''Yorck'' was laid down in February 1903, at [[Blohm & Voss]] shipyard. ''Yorck'' was launched on 14 May 1904 and completed on 21 November 1905 at a cost of 16,241,000 marks.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 51&ndash;52</ref> ''Roon'' was laid down as ''Ersatz Kaiser'', as a replacement for the old armored frigate {{SMS|Kaiser|1875|2}},<ref name=G51/> which had been renamed ''Uranus'' and used as a harbor ship.<ref name=G7>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 7</ref> ''Yorck'' was ordered as ''Ersatz Deutschland'' to replace {{SMS|Deutschland|1874|2}},<ref name=G51/> the sistership to ''Kaiser'', which had renamed ''Jupiter'' and converted into a [[target ship]].<ref name=G7/>

==Service history==
===SMS ''Roon''===
[[File:SMS Roon.PNG|thumb|left|''Roon'' before World War I|alt=]]
After commissioning into the fleet, {{SMS|Roon||2}} was assigned to the [[I Scouting Group]]. In 1908, she served as the flagship for Rear Admiral Jacobsen in the second division.<ref name=ASNE1053>''Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers'', p. 1053</ref> ''Roon'' served here until 1912 when she was replaced by the new [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Moltke|1910|2}}.<ref>Staff, p. 15</ref>

At the start of [[World War I]], ''Roon'' was serving as the [[flagship]] of the III Scouting Group. The ship participated in several actions during [[World War I]], including the [[raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby]], during which she served in the cruiser screen for the [[dreadnought]]s of the [[High Seas Fleet]].<ref>Scheer, p. 69</ref> ''Roon'' also conducted operations against Russian forces in the [[Baltic Sea]], including bombardments against the Russian positions at [[Libau]] in support of the army in May 1915.<ref>Halpern, p. 191</ref> The [[Battle of <U+00C5>land Islands]] took place between ''Roon'' and several other German cruisers and Russian forces led by the powerful cruiser [[Russian cruiser Rurik (1906)|''Rurik'']]. in July 1915.<ref>Halpern, pp. 194&ndash;195</ref> In August ''Roon'' and {{SMS|Prinz Heinrich||2}} bombarded Russian positions in the Baltic and briefly engaged several Russian [[destroyer]]s.<ref>Tucker pp. 293<U+2013>294</ref> 

After 1916, ''Roon'' was disarmed and used as a guard ship and floating barracks in [[Kiel]] until the end of the war. Design work commenced in 1916 to convert the ship into a [[seaplane carrier]]; work was planned to last from 1917 to 1918 during a period of 20 months. The ship was struck from the naval register on 25 November 1920 and scrapped the following year at Kiel-Nordmole.<ref name=G52/>

===SMS ''Yorck''===
{{SMS|Yorck||2}} also served in the I Scouting Group with her sistership, in the second division. In 1908, the ship won the annual "Kaiser's Challenge Cups for Prize Firing" for the reconnaissance squadron.<ref name=ASNE1053/> In 1911, the ship came under the command of [[Franz von Hipper]], who would go on to command the I Scouting Group during the war.<ref>Philbin, p. 18</ref> Hipper held this position aboard ''Yorck'' from 1 October 1911 to 26 January 1912.<ref>Philbin, p. 183</ref> In early 1912 the ship was decommissioned and her crew was transferred to the new battlecruiser {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}}.<ref>Staff, p. 22</ref>

The ship had a short career during World War I. At the outbreak of war, ''Yorck'' was brought out of the reserve fleet and joined her sistership ''Roon'' in the III Scouting Group. After the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, the ship made a navigational error upon returning to the [[Jadebusen]], and accidentally sailed into a German defensive minefield. The ship sank quickly and only 127 men of her complement of 629 were rescued.<ref>Tarrant, p. 30</ref> The wreck was cleared over several periods between 1929 and the mid 1980s. The first period of work lasted from 1929&ndash;30; work commenced briefly in 1965. The final work on removing the ship began in 1982.<ref name=G52/>
