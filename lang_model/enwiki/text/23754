The '''hooker with a heart of gold''' (also the '''whore with a heart of gold''' or the '''tart with a heart''') is a [[stock character]] involving a courtesan or prostitute with a hidden [[integrity]] and kindness.  She (the character is traditionally female) is usually an example of [[irony]]: an ostensibly immoral woman who demonstrates virtues absent in others.

==Characteristics==
This character is often a pivotal, but peripheral, character in literature and motion pictures, usually giving key advice or serving as a go-between. She is sometimes established in contrast to another female character who is morally correct but frigid or otherwise unyielding. Hookers with hearts of gold are sometimes reluctant prostitutes due to either desperation or coercion from a [[pimp]]. 

The stereotype might owe something of a debt to certain traditions surrounding the [[Bible|Biblical]] figures of [[Mary Magdalene]] and [[Rahab]], or to the ancient [[Theatre in India|Indian theatrical]] tradition of [[Sanskrit drama]] where [[<U+015A>udraka]]'s play ''[[M<U+1E5B>cchakatika]]'' (''The Little Clay Cart'') featured a [[nagarvadhu]] (courtesan) with a heart of gold named Vasantasena.<ref>{{cite book|title=Indian Literature and Popular Cinema|first=Heidi Rika Maria|last=Pauwels|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2008|isbn=0-415-44741-0|page=84}}</ref> But this stock character is pervasive enough in various myths and cultures in the form of a tragic story of the concubine who falls in love with her patron/client or, alternatively, young and often poor lover. Therefore, this might be considered not just an archetype but also fairly universal, and somewhat indicative of various societies' complex ideas about sexual decency and moral character. A variation on the theme, the dancer (stripper) with a heart of gold, is a tamer version of the character.

In opera and musical theater, a hooker with a heart of gold is most often portrayed by a [[mezzo-soprano]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} (One notable exception is the heroine of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[La traviata]]'', Violetta Valery, portrayed by a [[soprano]].) She is portrayed in a tragic light and often dies a tragic death. Another classic example of the "Tart with a heart" character is the character of Nancy in Charles Dickens' novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' and stage show "Oliver!"

In television history, the ''"tart with a heart"'' has become an important archetype in serial drama and [[soap opera]], especially in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. During the 1960s, the character of [[Elsie Tanner]] in British series ''[[Coronation Street]]'' set the mold for future characters such as [[Bet Lynch]] (also ''Coronation Street'') and [[Kat Moon|Kat Slater]] (''[[EastEnders]]''). Characters of this nature are often depicted as having tragic lives, but put on a front when in public to create the illusion of happiness. More often than not, these female characters are vital to their respective shows, and inevitably become some of the biggest stars in British Television.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The hooker with a heart of gold is also a prominent character in many American [[western movies]]. In ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'', detective Dave Kujan says to Roger "Verbal" Kint: "... so don't sell me the hooker with a heart of gold."

Two [[Shirley MacLaine]] roles<U+2014>Ginny Moorhead in 1958's ''[[Some Came Running]]'' and Irma la Douce in 1960's ''[[Irma la Douce]]''<U+2014>exemplify such characters.

[[Jamie Lee Curtis]]'s role in ''[[Trading Places]]'' has been called an example of this archetype.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/276705%7c0/Trading-Places.html|title=Trading Places|last=Soars|first=Emily|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref>

The 1990 film ''[[Pretty Woman]] ''(starring [[Julia Roberts]] and [[Richard Gere]]) is probably the most recognizable modern depiction of the 'hooker with a heart of gold'.

''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' is another modern-day film, in which the main character is a courtesan named Satine who does end up having a heart and falling in love, but ultimately (tragically) dies of tuberculosis during one of her performances and never actually gets to be with the one she truly loves.

In the 2012 film ''[[Fury (2012 film)|Fury]]'' (originally titled ''The Samaritan'') ex-con Foley (played by [[Samuel L. Jackson]]) falls in love with a disturbed but ultimately good hearted prostitute named Iris (played by [[Ruth Negga]]).

The songs "[[Carmen (song)|Carmen]]" by [[Lana Del Rey]] and "[[The A Team (song)|The A Team]]" by [[Ed Sheeran]] each describe such a character.
