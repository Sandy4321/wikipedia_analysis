'''Tucson International Airport''' {{Airport codes|TUS|KTUS|TUS}} is a public [[airport]] located six miles (10 [[Kilometre|km]]) south of the [[central business district]] (CBD) of [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], a city in [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]], [[Arizona]], [[United States|USA]]. It is the second largest commercial airport in Arizona and covers 8,244 [[acre]]s of land.

== History ==

In 1919, Tucson opened the first [[municipal|municipally]]-owned airport in the [[United States]]. Nine years later, in 1928, commercial air service began at Tucson with Standard Airlines (later [[American Airlines]]) in 1928. Regular [[airmail]] service started two years later.<ref>[http://www.tucsonairport.org/html/tia_tiafacts.html Tucson International Airport History]</ref>

In 1948, the '''Tucson Airport Authority''' was created as a [[non-profit corporation]] to operate the airport. The airport was then moved to its current location and operated on the west ramp out of three hangars vacated by [[WWII]] military manufacturing companies. 

In 1963 a new terminal facility was completed, housing six airlines and an international inspection station, earning the title, Tucson International Airport.

Although ''Tucson International'' is not a hub for any major passenger airline company, it does serve as a hub for [[cargo airline]] [[Evergreen International]], and it receives ten daily jet flights from [[Sky Harbor International Airport]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and from other Southwestern [[United States]] destinations, as well as flights from the East and the Pacific Northwest. International service to Tucson International Airport is limited to one daily flight from [[Mexico]]. Currently, [[Aerolitoral]] is the only [[airline]] that offers Tucson passengers service to Mexico. Past service to Mexico was provided by [[Aerom<U+00E9>xico]].

In 2006, Tucson International Airport set a new passenger record for the third consecutive year with 4,226,759 total arriving and departing passengers, an increase of 2.3% over the 2005 total. Of the average of 72 daily departures, Tucson's top ranked carriers included [[Southwest Airlines]], which owned a 30% market share, [[American Airlines]] which had accounted for 22% of the total traffic, and [[US Airways]] which had a 14% market share.    
   
The airport recently had its curbside extensively renovated.  Renovations to both concourses began in late 2006. As part of the renovations, the current concourses and gates will be renumbered with the East Concourse becoming Concourse A: Gates A1 - A9, and the West Concourse becoming Concourse B: Gates B1 - B11. The international arrival and departure area will also be moved to the main terminal in Concourse A, whereas before it existed in a separate terminal.

Tucson International Airport is operated by Tucson Airport Authority, which also operates [[Ryan Field (airport)|Ryan Field]].
