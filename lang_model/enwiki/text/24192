==Plot==
Rom<U+00E3>o ([[Wagner Moura]]) and Rose ([[Cl<U+00E1>udia Abreu]]) are a poor couple living in [[Para<U+00ED>ba]] and in search of a job that pays R$ 1,000 a month, the sum Rom<U+00E3>o believes to be the minimum necessary for him to feed his children. They decide to make a trip by bicycle to Rio de Janeiro with their five children: teenager Ant<U+00F4>nio (Ravi Ramos Lacerda); children Rodney (Manoel Sebasti<U+00E3>o Alves Filho), Cl<U+00E9>vis (Felipe Newton Silva Rodrigues) and Suelena (C<U+00ED>cera Cristina Almino de Lima); and newborn C<U+00ED>cero (C<U+00ED>cero Wesley A. Ferreira). 

Along the way, they make some money washing cars and performing [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]] songs. They also give a chance to some promising opportunities, but all of them fail. They are first offered a job by a criminal, who warns them that he can only give work for "sons of a bitches". They are later promised jobs by Severino, a councilman of [[S<U+00E3>o Bento, Para<U+00ED>ba|S<U+00E3>o Bento]], but since it takes too long for him to fulfill it, they decide to leave.

Later, they pray by the [[Statue of Father C<U+00ED>cero]] in [[Juazeiro do Norte]], where Rom<U+00E3>o hears an announcement about the "table of Padre C<U+00ED>cero", one that will grant a blessing for the one who manages to lift it. Rom<U+00E3>o gives it a try, lifts it, but faints just afterwards. Later, they meet a lone traveler called Gide<U+00E3>o (Cl<U+00E1>udio Jaborandy), who tells them to go to [[Filad<U+00E9>lfia, Bahia|Filad<U+00E9>lfia]] and search for Negui<U+00E7>a ([[F<U+00E1>bio Lago]]). That night, Ant<U+00F4>nio and Cl<U+00E9>vis find a church nearby and accidentally smash a cash box full of money. Ant<U+00F4>nio gives in to temptation and takes all the bills. In Filad<U+00E9>lfia, the family meets Negui<U+00E7>a, who offers them shelter, but says he has no jobs. Ant<U+00F4>nio tries to go to the local night party, but flees as soon as he gets there, unable to feel comfortable. 

In [[Feira de Santana]], Ant<U+00F4>nio goes to the local [[bus terminus]] and buys tickets to Rio de Janeiro for everyone. When his parents ask where he got the money, Ant<U+00F4>nio admits it was taken from the church and Rom<U+00E3>o tears all the tickets apart. Later, the family stumble upon Panam<U+00E1> ([[Sidney Magal]]) and Callado (Franciolli Luciano), a pair looking for men, women and children from all ages for a "great opportunity", with no skills required. Rom<U+00E3>o reluctantly agrees and convinces Panam<U+00E1> to allow him to take the bikes with them on the truck that'll take them to the opportunity, as well as three members of the family that weren't selected for the job.

The opportunity turns out to be a fake [[Patax<U+00F3> people|Patax<U+00F3>]] [[quarup]] ritual in a club in [[Porto Seguro]], where Rom<U+00E3>o and three of his children are dressed as supposedly legit Patax<U+00F3> and Panam<U+00E1> poses as a foreign entertainer, owner of a park called Caminho das Nuvens (the original title of the film; could be translated as "Path of the Clouds"). Ant<U+00F4>nio sneaks in the club and when Rom<U+00E3>o sees him, he leaves the place mid-ritual, and so do his children. Frustrated, he orders Rose never to arrange them such jobs anymore.

Still in Porto Seguro, Ant<U+00F4>nio meets Sereia ([[Carol Castro]]), who is giving out some Caminho das Nuvens flyers. Soon after, he meets Negui<U+00E7>a and Gide<U+00E3>o again, and they take him to a local party, where he meets Sereia one more time and takes an [[Instant camera|instant picture]] with her. The morning after, Rose reprehends him for disappearing without any warning and he announces he will stay in Porto Seguro. Rom<U+00E3>o accepts and leaves with the rest of the family. That night, he tries to met Sereia, but she is hooking up with Panam<U+00E1>. Ant<U+00F4>nio spills some beverage on Panam<U+00E1>'s face, and Sereia responds by pushing him to the ground. Later, he meets his family again by case.

Upon arriving in the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|state of Rio de Janeiro]], Rom<U+00E3>o arranges Ant<U+00F4>nio a job as a [[bricklayer]] in a city far from Rio de Janeiro. He agrees to stay and says the real last goodbye to his family. As Rom<U+00E3>o and his family arrive in Rio de Janeiro, they get to the [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]] and Rom<U+00E3>o asks a man for directions to [[Bras<U+00ED>lia]]. Rose listens to it and says she is definitely not going back to the road.
