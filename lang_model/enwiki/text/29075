==Professional career==
===New England Patriots===
Brown was drafted in the fourth round (110th overall) in the [[1993 NFL Draft]] by the [[New England Patriots]]. He started a career-high 12 games at safety as a rookie, recording 56 tackles, also a career-high. He went on to play three more seasons for the Patriots and head coach [[Bill Parcells]] (and in [[1996 New England Patriots season|1996]], secondary coach [[Bill Belichick]]), starting only two games over that span and picking up 38 tackles.

===New York Jets===
Brown followed Parcells and Belichick to the [[New York Jets]] in [[1997 New York Jets season|1997]], starting one game over two seasons and recording 29 tackles and one interception.

===Detroit Lions===
The final two years of Brown's career were spent with the [[Detroit Lions]]. After starting one game in [[1999 Detroit Lions season|1999]], Brown started four games in [[2000 Detroit Lions season|2000]], recording a half sack, two interceptions, and 21 tackles. He retired following the season at age 30.

===New York Jets===
Brown joined the Jets as a defensive backs coach in [[2004 New York Jets season|2004]] under head coach [[Herman Edwards]] and spent three years with the team, including one under then-new head coach and former Patriots assistant [[Eric Mangini]] in [[2006 New York Jets season|2006]].
