The [[Olympic closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] of the London [[2012 Summer Olympics]], also known as '''A Symphony of British Music''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2012_08_12/2012-Olympics-closing-ceremony-A-symphony-of-British-music/ |title=2012 Olympics closing ceremony: <U+2018>A symphony of British music<U+2019>|work=[[The Voice of Russia]] |date=12 August 2012 |accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref> was held on 12 August in the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]]. The event was created by [[Kim Gavin]], [[Es Devlin]], [[Stephen Daldry]], [[David Arnold]] and [[Mark Fisher (architect)|Mark Fisher]]. The worldwide broadcast began at 21:00 [[British Summer Time|BST]] ([[UTC+01:00|UTC+1]]) and finished at 00:11, lasting three hours and eleven minutes.  

The stadium had been turned into a giant representation of the Union Flag, designed by [[Damien Hirst]]. Around 4,100 people partook in the ceremony; which reportedly cost <U+00A3>20 million. The 2012 Summer Olympics were officially closed by [[Jacques Rogge]], who called London's games "happy and glorious." The ceremony included a handover to the next host city for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] and saw the Olympic flame extinguished and the flag lowered. The main part of the evening featured a one hour symphony of British Music as a number of British Pop acts appeared. Tributes to [[John Lennon]] and [[Freddie Mercury]] and the fashion industry were included in the section.  Rio marked the handover with an eight-minute section known as Embrace created by [[Cao Hamburger]] and [[Daniela Thomas]] featuring [[Pel<U+00E9>]]. [[Sebastian Coe]] gave a speech and the volunteers of London 2012 were thanked. 

An average of 23.2 million viewers in the United Kingdom watched the event, with an estimated 750 million worldwide. Critics were generally positive, but noted that it was not as good as the opening ceremony. Some of the foreign reviews questioned whether everyone would have understood the nods to British film and television. [[George Michael]] was roundly criticised for his song choice while [[Kate Moss]], [[Naomi Campbell]] and [[Russell Brand]] were criticised for not demonstrating the Olympic ethos in their past behaviour. [[Gary Barlow]] was praised for his appearance just a week after the death of his daughter. Some performers were initially reluctant to appear, other high profile acts refused to perform at the ceremony. [[NBC]] in America and [[Prime (New Zealand)|Prime TV]] in New Zealand were criticised by viewers for their broadcast of the ceremony. There was also a concert in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] to close the Olympics, headlined by [[Blur (band)|Blur]].

The representation of the [[Union Flag]] used as an arena centrepiece was designed by [[Damien Hirst]] to celebrate the "anarchy and diversity of British pop art, and by extension the energy and multiplicity of contemporary British culture". Hirst had been approached in November 2011 and agreed to do the design; he called his artwork ''Beautiful Union Jack Celebratory Patriotic Olympic Explosion in an Electric Storm Painting''. 176 photographs made up one centimetre of the stadium artwork with graphic designers having spent three months creating super-high-resolution images before printing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/london-2012/9484348/London-2012-Olympics-why-we-reinvented-the-Union-flag-for-the-Closing-Ceremony.html|title=Why we reinvented the Union flag for the Closing Ceremony|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 August 2012|accessdate=26 August 2012|first=Es|last=Devlin}}</ref>

==Performance synopsis==

===Rush Hour (21:00<U+2013>21:09)===
[[File:Miniature London at 2012 Olympic Closing Ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Landmarks in the stadium.]]
The ceremony began after a filmed countdown showing numbers from around London on such locations as road signs, [[10 Downing Street]] and the [[Palace of Westminster]] clock tower, with a camera panning up the [[River Thames]] over [[Tower Bridge]] before turning left towards the stadium.  The audience then completed a 10-second countdown to the start of the ceremony, to the chimes of [[Big Ben]].  The arena had been transformed into a huge representation of the [[Union Flag]] in black and white,<ref name="Yemanja"/> with ramps and famous London landmarks such as the [[London Eye]], Big Ben, [[Battersea Power Station]] and the [[30 St Mary Axe|Gherkin]]. Newspaper cutouts on both the set and road vehicles sought to show a "day in the life of London", with words from British literary figures such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] [[Carol Ann Duffy]].<ref name="Del Boy"/>

[[Emeli Sand<U+00E9>]] appeared on a truck and sang a verse and the chorus of "[[Read All About It (song)|Read All About It (Pt III)]]". The Urban Voices Collective (the choir for the ceremony) sang [[The Beatles|The Beatles']] "[[Because (The Beatles song)|Because]]", which merged into cellist [[Julian Lloyd Webber]] (sat upon the [[Royal Albert Hall]]<ref name="Yemanja"/>) playing [[Elgar]]'s [[Salut d'amour]], accompanied by [[Stomp (dance troupe)|Stomp]] performing on household items such as pots, pans and dustbins while suspended on the sculptures of the landmarks.

===God Save the Queen===
At the same time, [[Winston Churchill]] ([[Timothy Spall]]) appeared at the top of [[Elizabeth Tower|Big Ben]] and reprised Caliban's "Be not afeard" speech from ''[[The Tempest]]'', first read by [[Kenneth Branagh]] in the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]]. More paper-covered motor vehicles entered. After Churchill finished his speech, people dressed in newspaper print began to fill the arena, ranging from office workers to school children. The beat of the music got faster and noisier, symbolising the London rush hour.  As the noise reached a crescendo, Churchill cried out for all to stop, bringing this section to an end.

[[Prince Henry of Wales]], representing the Queen, arrived with the President of the [[International Olympic Committee]] [[Jacques Rogge]]. The [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and the Urban Voice Choir performed the [[God Save the Queen|national anthem of the United Kingdom]] whilst the Union flag was raised by the armed forces and the performers waved mini Union flags in the stadium. Once the flag was raised Hirst's artwork was revealed as the grey clouds were removed.<ref name="Yemanja"/>

===Street Party (21:09<U+2013>21:20)===
This section started off with [[Michael Caine]] counting down from five, whereupon the [[Reliant Regal]] from ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' exploded with Del Boy and Rodney jumping out dressed as [[Batman]] and Robin.  Caine's words, ''[[The Italian Job|You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!]]'', echoed around the stadium. All the lorries had the newspaper removed and a colourful street party erupted, while [[Madness (band)|Madness]] performed "[[Our House (Madness song)|Our House]]". This was followed by the Massed Bands of the [[Household Division]] marching whilst playing [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s "[[Parklife (song)|Parklife]]". Entering on [[cycle rickshaw|rickshaws]], the [[Pet Shop Boys]] performed their hit "[[West End Girls]]", and then [[One Direction]] performed "[[What Makes You Beautiful]]" from the back of a lorry. Next there was another performance by Stomp.

===Waterloo Sunset (21:20<U+2013>21:30)===
The centre of the arena was then cleared to reveal ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' 2010 winners [[Spelbound]], who performed gymnastics to [[The Beatles]] "[[A Day in the Life]]", were inspired by the idea of a commuter on the way to work, by forming a bed and a London Bus. [[Ray Davies]] of [[The Kinks]] arrived in a [[Hackney carriage|black cab]] and played "[[Waterloo Sunset]]", as Spelbound continued and local school children formed the themes.  The section closed with Sand<U+00E9> reprising "Read All About It (Pt. III)" as a montage of athletes crying in victory or defeat was shown on the screens.

===Parade of Athletes (21:30<U+2013>21:53)===
[[File:Athletes at the 2012 Closing Ceremony.jpg|thumb|Olympic athletes assembled in the shape of the [[Union Flag]]]]
[[Greece at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Greece]] led the Entrance of the Flags, as all 204 flags filed in to the strains of "Parade of the Athletes" (composed by Arnold) and marched up the central cross of the union flag, with [[Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Great Britain]] bringing up the rear. Meanwhile, volunteer marshals wearing blue suits and blue bowler hats with light bulbs on top marched into the stadium. The athletes then walked in from the several entrances, with some filtering down through the lower stands. As the same time [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]] performed "[[Open Arms (Elbow song)|Open Arms]]" and "[[One Day Like This]]". The volunteer marshals helped to usher the athletes into pens between the ramps of the arena. As the last athletes streamed into the stadium and the flags were moved by volunteers closer to the Olympic Flame, a reprise of some of the songs from the opening section was played.

===Here Comes the Sun (21:53<U+2013>22:07)===
{{main|2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony flag bearers}}
16 [[dhol]] drummers opened this segment as the performers entered carrying 303 white boxes to symbolise every event in the Olympic Games. The drumming merged into [[Kate Bush]]'s "[[Running Up that Hill|Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God Remix)]]", as performers arranged the boxes to form a pyramid while video highlights from the previous 16 days of competition were shown on the screens. 

This was followed by the victory ceremony for the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Men's marathon|Men's Marathon]], by tradition the final medal ceremony of the Games. Rogge and [[Lamine Diack]], president of the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]], awarded the medals before the [[Oh Uganda, Land of Beauty|Ugandan national anthem]] was played. 

Six athletes including [[Katherine Grainger]] and [[Katie Taylor]] presented flowers to six volunteers in a symbolic recognition of the 70,000 volunteers' contribution to the Games.  This part of the ceremony was accompanied by The Beatles' "[[Here Comes the Sun]]".

===A Symphony of British Music (22:07<U+2013>23:21)===
[[File:John Lennon face sculpture, 2012 London Olympics closing ceremony.jpg|thumb|A sculpture of the face of [[John Lennon]] at the closing ceremony.]]
The section commenced with Queen's "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" being played and a graphic equaliser being shown on the pixel screen.  [[John Lennon]] then appeared on the big screens and was joined by Choirs of Liverpool in singing "[[Imagine (song)|Imagine]]" as a bust of Lennon's face was created. Balloons were released at the end of this and [[George Michael]] followed singing "[[Freedom! '90]]" and "[[White Light (George Michael song)|White Light]]". A group of [[Mod (subculture)|mods]] on [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]] followed invading the arena; one of them carried [[Ricky Wilson (British musician)|Ricky Wilson]] to the stage where his band the [[Kaiser Chiefs]] proceeded to cover [[The Who|The Who's]] "[[Pinball Wizard]]"; during the song the scooters continued to circle the arena. Several extracts of [[David Bowie]] songs followed, accompanied by images of Bowie; this continued until eight billboards with artwork of models on arrived in the stadium, representing the British fashion industry. The artwork was dropped to reveal the models standing behind: [[Naomi Campbell]] (wearing [[Alexander McQueen (brand)|Alexander McQueen]]),<ref name="Fashion">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/london-2012/9471522/London-2012-Team-of-role-models-made-this-the-Girl-Power-Games.html|first=Bryony|last=Gordon|date=13 August 2012|accessdate=20 August 2012|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Team of role models made this the Girl Power Games}}</ref><ref name="Fashion 2">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9471476/London-2012-closing-ceremony-Fashion-superstars-show-why-Britain-is-catwalk-gold.html|title=Fashion superstars show why Britain is catwalk gold|first=Luke|last=Leitch|date=13 August 2012|accessdate 20 August 2012|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> [[Lily Cole]] (wearing [[Erdem]]),<ref name="Fashion 2"/> [[Karen Elson]] (wearing [[Burberry]]),<ref name="Fashion 2"/> [[Lily Donaldson]] (wearing [[Vivienne Westwood]]),<ref name="Fashion"/><ref name="Fashion 2"/> [[Jourdan Dunn]] (wearing [[Jonathan Saunders]]),<ref name="Fashion"/><ref name="Fashion 2"/> [[David Gandy]] (wearing [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]]),<ref name="Fashion 2"/> [[Georgia May Jagger]] (wearing [[Victoria Beckham#Fashion|Victoria Beckham]]),<ref name="Fashion"/><ref name="Fashion 2"/> [[Kate Moss]] (wearing [[Alexander McQueen (brand)|Alexander McQueen]])<ref name="Fashion"/><ref name="Fashion 2"/> and [[Stella Tennant]] (wearing [[Christopher Kane]]).<ref name="Fashion"/><ref name="Fashion 2"/>  The models concluded the section by turning the struts of the [[Union Flag]] into a [[catwalk]] as they proceeded to the centre, walking to Bowie's 1980 single "[[Fashion (David Bowie song)|Fashion]]".

A wooden boat was then carried in; on board was [[Annie Lennox]] who proceeded to sing "[[Little Bird (Annie Lennox song)|Little Bird]]". [[Ed Sheeran]] followed and was joined by [[Richard Jones (bassist)|Richard Jones]] of [[The Feeling]], [[Nick Mason]] of [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Mike Rutherford]] of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Mike + The Mechanics]], to cover the Floyd's "[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd song)|Wish You Were Here]]". Near the end of the song a performer appeared on a tightrope above the stadium, walked along it, and shook hands with a mannequin, which then burst into flames (referencing the cover of Floyd's 1975 album ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]''). A bus then entered with [[Russell Brand]] sitting on top of it miming "[[I Am the Walrus]];" before introducing [[Fatboy Slim]], who played "[[Right Here, Right Now (Fatboy Slim song)|Right Here Right Now]]" and "[[The Rockafeller Skank]]"; as the bus slowly transformed into a large inflatable Octopus. Three convertible [[Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coup<U+00E9>]]s then arrived; the roof of the first was taken down to reveal [[Jessie J]] who sang her hit "[[Price Tag]]", as the cars did a lap of the stadium. Jessie J provided guest vocals as the next car had its roof removed, to show [[Tinie Tempah]] who sang "[[Written in the Stars (Tinie Tempah song)|Written in the Stars]]". The third car carried [[Taio Cruz]] who sang "[[Dynamite (Taio Cruz song)|Dynamite]]". All three then left the cars to combine to cover the [[Bee Gees]]' "[[You Should Be Dancing]]".

[[File:London cabs with Spice Girls.jpg|thumb|left|Cabs carrying the [[Spice Girls]].]]
A number of black cabs entered the stadium, five of which lit up with LED lights, each decorated with [[The Spice Girls]]' individual trademark embalms, (Posh: sparkling black, Sporty: go-faster stripes, Scary: leopard print, Baby: pink and Ginger: The Union Flag). The Spice Girls emerged from the cabs and performed "[[Wannabe (song)|Wannabe]]" and "[[Spice Up Your Life]]". Half way through their performance, they ascended onto the roofs of the cabs and proceeded to race around the stadium at seemingly fast speeds whilst singing and dancing from the roofs. 
[[Beady Eye]] followed by performing [[Oasis (band)|Oasis's]] "[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]". "[[Mr. Blue Sky]]" by [[Electric Light Orchestra]] was played as a tribute to aviation was performed. Near the end of this song a human cannonball "died" and out rolled [[Eric Idle]], who sang "[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]", accompanied variously by nuns on roller-skates, [[Morris dance]]rs (Blackheath Morris and Rag Morris),<ref name="volunteers">{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/mm/Document/Documents/General/01/39/69/96/OCCVolunteers_Neutral.pdf |title=Volunteers B<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>voles |work=London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games |accessdate=10 September 2012|format=PDF}}</ref> Roman soldiers,<ref name="aljaz"/> and Punjabi [[Bhangra (music)|bhangra musicians]] [[Bhangra (dance)|dancers]] (VP Bhangra),<ref name="volunteers"/> before a [[human cannonball]] was fired across the arena.<ref name="aljaz">ref name="aljaz">{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/08/201281305330562117.html |title=London ends Olympics on extravagant notes <U+2013> Europe |work=Al Jazeera English |date=4 October 2011 |accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref> [[Muse (band)|Muse]] then appeared and proceeded to sing the official song of London 2012, "[[Survival (Muse song)|Survival]]".<ref name="London2012Rio2016"/> In the darkness four trucks with screens on them entered and went to the centre of the stadium. [[Freddie Mercury]] then appeared on these and other screens around the stadium, before his bandmate [[Brian May]] performed a guitar solo. May was then joined by [[Roger Meddows Taylor|Roger Taylor]] to re-form Queen, as Jessie J, who wore a long yellow jacket in homage to Mercury accompanied the pair for "[[We Will Rock You]]."  More fireworks ended this section.

===The Road to Rio (23:21<U+2013>23:30)===
The section began with the [[Hymn to Liberty|Greek national anthem]] being played and raising of the flag; followed by the [[Olympic anthem]] and the lowering of the flag.  [[The Mayor of London]], [[Boris Johnson]], then handed the Olympic Flag to [[Jacques Rogge]], who in turn passed it to [[Eduardo Paes]], [[mayor of Rio de Janeiro|the Mayor of Rio de Janeiro]].<ref name="aljaz"/> This was followed by the [[Hino Nacional Brasileiro|Brazilian national anthem]] and raising of the flag. The Olympic Flag will be raised again in [[Sochi]] on 7 February 2014 at the opening ceremony of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]].

===Embrace (23:30<U+2013>23:38)===
[[File:Rio takeover.jpg|thumb|right|The end of Rio's segment.]]
Rio then provided an eight-minute segment to introduce the world to its city, created by [[Cao Hamburger]] and [[Daniela Thomas]] entitled "Embrace".<ref name="London2012Rio2016"/> The showcase presented both indigenous and Latin culture, as well as some mock [[Rio Carnival]] performers, and began with the street cleaner Renato Sorriso dancing [[samba]] joined by sailor [[Robert Scheidt]]. The section continued with a Carnival-eqsue Samba parade as various artists performed, including singers [[Marisa Monte]] (dressed as water goddess [[Yemanja]]<ref name="Yemanja">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2187413/London-2012-Closing-Ceremony-Eric-Idle-leads-crowd-rendition-Always-Look-Bright-Side-Life.html|title=Feeling sad about the end of the Games?

Coe thanked the country for getting behind the Games, and recalled his words from the Opening Ceremony "these will be a games for everyone", concluding "these were a games ''by'' everyone." He went on to thank the athletes and say that "the spirit of these Olympics will inspire a generation", before concluding that "when our time came, Britain, we did it right!".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/london-2012/9471489/London-2012-We-lit-up-the-world-says-Lord-Coe.html|title='We lit up the world' says Lord Coe|first=Hannah|last=Furness|date=13 August 2012|accessdate=20 August 2012|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>

Rogge thanked Coe and his [[London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games]] team, saying that they had done a "superb job". He said "we are indebted to so many tonight", thanking the "wonderful volunteers, the much needed heroes of these Games", as well as the British public and the athletes. Rogge said that the athletes had earned the right to be called 'Olympians' due to the fair play and graciousness that they had shown, and he looked forward to the [[2012 Summer Paralympics|Paralympic Games]]. Rogge concluded by calling the Games "happy and glorious", before proceeding to close the competition and calling upon the youth of the world to assemble in [[2016 Summer Olympic Games|Rio in 2016]], ending with "Thank you, London!".<ref>{{cite news|url=

The arms holding the copper petals that formed the [[2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics cauldron|Olympic cauldron]] were part-lowered, and fireworks set off behind; when the smoke had cleared, a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] was seen above the flames. [[Take That]] then performed "[[Rule the World]]". [[Darcey Bussell]] followed flying down from the top of the stadium in a guise of a phoenix and was joined by four male principle dancers from the [[The Royal Ballet]], [[Gary Avis]], [[Jonathan Cope (dancer)|Jonathan Cope]], [[Nehemiah Kish]] and [[Edward Watson (dancer)|Ed Watson]] and over 200 ballerinas,<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://olympicclosingceremony.tumblr.com/tagged/stage10|title=Spirit of the flame|work=London 2012}}</ref><ref name="London2012Rio2016">{{citenews|url=http://www.london2012.com/media-centre/article=london-throws-world-biggest-party-for-olympic-athletes-closing-ceremony-spectacular.html|title=London throws World biggest party of Olympic athletes closing ceremony spectacular|work=London 2012|date=12 August 2012}}</ref> who proceeded to perform a dance called 'the spirit of the flame', after which the [[Olympic Flame]] was extinguished.

===Finale (00:00<U+2013>00:07)===
The closing act of the ceremony was [[The Who]], who performed a medley of the songs "[[Baba O'Riley]]", "[[See Me, Feel Me]]" and "[[My Generation]]" as a montage of images of Games volunteers and Londoners appeared on the big screen. All star performers also appeared on the stage behind the band, while participants in the ceremony also marched through the centrestage towards The Who.

An estimated worldwide television audience of 750 million watched the event.<ref name="aljaz">{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/08/201281305330562117.html |title=London ends Olympics on extravagant notes <U+2013> Europe |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=4 October 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref> Early data suggested that the British TV audience averaged 23.2 million and hit a peak of 26.2 million at 21:35.<ref name="Bowie"/><ref name="GB viewing"/>

The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' commented during the ceremony that, although fun, it lacked "top drawer" performers, and that Annie Lennox was "utterly underwhelming."  However One Direction, Jessie J, Tinie Tempah and Taio Cruz "shone", while the Spice Girls "got the exuberant tone exactly right".<ref>{{cite web|first=Bernadette|last= McNulty|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopreviews/9467519/Olympic-Closing-Ceremony-London-2012-review.html |title=Olympic Closing Ceremony London 2012: review |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 August 2012 |accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref> Tom Sutcliffe writing for ''[[The Independent]]'' said that it was "slick, impressive, often visually startling" and "eccentric, bewildering <U+2013> and shameless good fun". He added that "where Danny Boyle's opening show had been a statement of intent and national values, this was an hour-long advert for British stadium rock-show design."<ref>{{cite news|last=Sutcliffe|first=Tom|title=London Olympics 2012 closing ceremony: Eccentric, bewildering <U+2013> and shameless good fun|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/london-olympics-2012-closing-ceremony-eccentric-bewildering--and-shameless-good-fun-8037281.html|work=[[The Independent]]|date=13 August 2012|accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref>

[[The Guardian]] writer [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] wrote that he was not sure how to review "a mix of pageant, pop-concert, street-party and presentation ceremony." He added that it communicated the "energy of British popular culture over the past few decades and the gaiety of our Olympic ceremonies."  Billington praised Boyle, Devlin and Daldry, who had done a "tremendous job in lending what might have been orthodox Olympic rituals a blast of theatrical vitality."<ref>{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Billington |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/13/london-2012-olympic-games-closing-ceremony-review?INTCMP=SRCH |title=London 2012 closing ceremony - review |work=The Guardian |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2012}}</ref> While Alexis Petridis writing for the same paper said that the lack of a "gasp inducing moment" spoilt the show.<ref>{{cite web|first=Alexis|last= Petridis |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/13/olympics-closing-ceremony-music-review?intcmp=239 |title=Olympics closing ceremony music: big acts, big hits, but no big gasps |work=The Guardian |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2012}}</ref> [[Jan Moir]] of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' queried whether the ceremony truly reflected Britain's musical heritage and described the opening section as "dull, dull, dull".  She asked "how could anyone follow the Opening Ceremony for entertainment?", challenged "the logic" of clips of artists such as Bush and Bowie who had "declined to appear", and said that the fashion section was "dreary".<ref>{{cite web|first=Jan|last= Moir |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2187509/Our-musical-heritage-Oh-pull-Jan-Moirs-Olympic-Closing-Ceremony.html#ixzz24sWjCQHe |title=Our musical heritage?

''[[New Zealand Herald|NZ Herald's]]'' Troy Rawhiti-Forbes wrote that there were "touches of brilliance, beauty, and bewilderment - often at the same time." However he called Russell Brand "tuneless", and during George Michael's performance he thought that "if there had been remote controls here in the stadium, people might have been reaching for them."  His "undisputed champions" of the night were the Spice Girls and The Who.<ref>{{cite web|first=Troy|last=Rawhiti<U+2013>Forbes|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=10826622 |title=Olympics: Closing ceremony review |work=NZ Herald|date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2012}}</ref>  David Rooney of the ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that the show "had something for every generation" and was an "all-star...crowd-pleaser."  However he wonders whether non-British viewers would have understood references to ''The Italian Job'' and ''Only Fools and Horses''. Rooney concludes that the "Rio preview and the rousing Britpop marathon that preceded it were a reminder that the Olympics are as much about spectacle as sport."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/olympics-closing-ceremony-london-spice-girls-george-michael-361167 |title=Closing Ceremony of the London Olympics: Review |work=[[Hollywood Reporter]] |date=12 August 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2012|first=David|last=Rooney}}</ref>

As with the opening ceremony, United States broadcaster [[NBC]] was criticised for its coverage.
