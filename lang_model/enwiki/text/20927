'''G<U+00FC>nther Schack''' (12 November 1917 <U+2013> 14 June 2003) was a [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[World War II]] [[fighter ace]] who served in the [[Luftwaffe]] from 1939 until the end of [[World War II]] in 1945. A flying ace or fighter ace is a [[military aviation|military aviator]] credited with shooting down five or more enemy [[aircraft]] during aerial combat.<ref>Spick 1996, pp. 3<U+2013>4.</ref> He claimed 174 enemy aircraft shot down, all of them on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian front]]. He survived being shot down 15 times during his 780 combat missions.<ref>Spick 1996, p. 228.</ref> After the war he lived secluded in the [[Eifel]] Mountains, and devoted himself to philosophical research.

==Early life==
G<U+00FC>nther Schack was born in [[Bartoszyce|Bartenstein]], a small town in [[Eastern Prussia]], on 12 November 1917 as the son of Dr. Willy Schack and his wife, Dorothea ([[maiden name]]: Nietzki). He studied at the [[University of Stuttgart]] and at the [[RWTH Aachen|''Rheinisch-Westf<U+00E4>lische Technische Hochschule'']] in [[Aachen]]. In 1937, when he first tried to join the Luftwaffe, he was categorised as ''wehruntauglich'' (unsuited for military service) because of a sports injury earlier in his life.

==Military career==
G<U+00FC>nther Schack resubmitted an application as a volunteer and was accepted into the [[Luftwaffe]] on 2 September 1939. After being trained as a fighter pilot, ''[[Gefreiter]]'' (Private) Schack was posted to 7th ''Staffel'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 51]] (JG 51&mdash;7th Squadron of the 51st Fighter Wing) on 18 March 1941.<ref name="Obermaier p65">Obermaier 1989, p. 65.</ref><ref group="Notes">For an explanation of the meaning of Luftwaffe unit designation see [[Luftwaffe Organization]]</ref>

Schack claimed his first aerial victory in combat on 23 July 1941 on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]]. He achieved his third aerial victory after 100 combat missions on 10 November 1941. He flew his 250th combat mission on 30 July 1942. By this time he had claimed 5 aerial victories.<ref name="Obermaier p65"/> He had been promoted to the rank of ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' (non-commissioned officer). After his 48th aerial victory, he was ordered back to Germany to serve as a flight instructor and was promoted to ''[[Leutnant]]'' (Second Lieutenant) on 1 January 1943.

He returned to the Eastern front, now serving in the 9th ''Staffel'' of JG 51 in early 1932. On 29 January 1943 Schack's ''[[Schwarm]]'' (flight of four aircraft), on a [[Junkers Ju 87]] escort mission, encountered eight Soviet [[Petlyakov Pe-2]] flying in a [[line astern]] crossing the German lines at [[Novosil]]. Within five minutes all eight were shot down including five by Schack.<ref>Weal 1996, pp. 14<U+2013>15.</ref> He claimed his century mark in aerial combat on 3 September 1943. On 8 December 1943, he was made ''[[Staffelkapit<U+00E4>n]]'' (squadron leader) of 9./JG 51. ''Leutnant'' G<U+00FC>nther Schack was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub'') on 20 April 1944 for 133 aerial victories.<ref>Weal 2001, p. 78.</ref> Schack was then promoted to ''[[Hauptmann]]'' (Captain) on 1 July 1944. In December 1944, he became a ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (Group Commander), in charge of I./JG 51. After this ''Gruppe'' was disbanded on 1 May 1945, he briefly was named commander of the 4th ''Gruppe'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 3]] "Udet". By the end of the war, he had scored 174 victories in 780 aerial combats, and was shot down 15 times. 

Schack was once shot down by [[Lieutenant]] Hollis "Bud" Nowlin of the [[357th Fighter Group]] over [[East Prussia]]. Nowlin and Schack met again first in Germany and then again in the fall of 1991 at the 357th Fighter Group reunion in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].<ref>Klinkowitz 1996, p. 64.</ref>

==Later life ==
After the war G<U+00FC>nther Schack worked as a Sales Manager in his uncle's manufacturing company. In 1968, he resigned from his job, left his wife and his three children and began a new life in an isolated cottage in the mountain area of [[Eifel]], where he lived as a [[vegetarian]], cultivating his own vegetables. During this time, he tried to deal with his trauma of the war and to develop and propagate his own philosophy of life: the "Homokratie".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
