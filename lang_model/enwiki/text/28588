'''Albert Speer''' ({{Pron-en|<U+02C8><U+0283>p<U+00E6>r}}; March&nbsp;19, 1905 <U+2013> September&nbsp;1, 1981) was a [[Germany|German]] [[architect]], author and, for part of [[World War II]], Minister of Armaments and War Production for the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]].  Speer was [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] chief architect before assuming ministerial office. As "the Nazi who said sorry",<ref>The title of a [http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/548364 BBC2 documentary]</ref> he accepted responsibility at the
[[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg trials]] and in his memoirs for the crimes of the Nazi regime.  His level of involvement in the persecution of the Jews and his level of knowledge of [[the Holocaust]] remain matters of dispute.

Speer joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1931. His architectural skills made him increasingly prominent within the Party and he became a member of Hitler's inner circle. The dictator commissioned him to design and construct a number of structures, including the [[Reich Chancellery]] and the ''[[Nazi party rally grounds|Zeppelinfeld]]'' stadium in [[Nuremberg]] where Party rallies were held.  Speer also made plans to [[Welthauptstadt Germania|reconstruct Berlin]] on a grand scale, with huge buildings, wide boulevards, and a reorganized transportation system.

As Hitler's Minister of Armaments and War Production, Speer's reforms were so successful that Germany's war production continued to increase despite massive and devastating [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing. After the war, he was tried at Nuremberg and sentenced to twenty years in prison for his role in the Nazi regime, principally for the use of [[Forced labor in Germany during World War II|forced labor]].  He served most of his sentence at [[Spandau Prison]] in [[West Berlin]].  

Following his release from Spandau in 1966, Speer wrote two bestselling autobiographical works, ''[[Inside the Third Reich]]'' and ''[[Spandau: The Secret Diaries]]'', detailing his often close personal relationship with Hitler, and providing readers and historians with a unique perspective inside the workings of the Nazi regime. He later wrote a third book, ''Infiltration'', about the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. Speer died of natural causes in 1981, in London, England.<ref name="harvnb">{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=337.}}</ref>

==Early years==
Speer was born in [[Mannheim]], Germany, the second of three sons of Albert and Luise Speer.  In 1918, the family moved to [[Heidelberg]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=7.}}</ref>   According to [[Henry T. King]], deputy prosecutor at Nuremberg who later wrote a book about Speer, "Love and warmth were lacking in the household of Speer's youth."<ref>{{Harvnb|King|1997|p=27.}}</ref>  Speer originally wanted to become a mathematician, but his father said if Speer chose this occupation he would "lead a life without money, without a position, and without a future".<ref>{{Harvnb|Schmidt|1984|p=28.}}</ref> Instead, Speer followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and studied architecture.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=11<U+2013>13.}}</ref>

Speer began his architectural studies at the [[University of Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]], rather than a more highly acclaimed institution, as the [[hyperinflation]] crisis of 1923 limited his parents' income.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=9.}}</ref> In 1924 when the crisis had abated, he transferred to the more prestigious [[Technical University of Munich]]. In 1925 he transferred again, this time to the [[Technical University of Berlin]] where he came under the tutelage of [[Heinrich Tessenow]], whom Speer greatly admired.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=10<U+2013>11.}}</ref> After passing his exams in 1927, Speer became Tessenow's assistant, a high honor for a man of 22.<ref>{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|pp=34<U+2013>36.}}</ref>  As Tessenow's assistant, Speer taught some of his classes while continuing his own postgraduate studies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=71<U+2013>73.}}</ref>  In Berlin, Speer began a close friendship, ultimately spanning over fifty years, with [[Rudolf Wolters]], who also studied under Tessenow.<ref>{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|pp=33<U+2013>34.}}</ref>

In the summer of 1922, Speer began to date Margarete Weber (1905<U+2013>1987). The relationship was frowned upon by Speer's class-conscious mother, who felt the Webers were socially inferior (Margarete's father was a successful craftsman who employed fifty workers). Despite this opposition, the two married in Berlin on August&nbsp;28, 1928, but seven years elapsed before Margarete Speer was first invited to her in-laws' home.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=47<U+2013>49.}}</ref>

==Nazi architect==
===Joining the Nazis (1930<U+2013>1934)===
[[Image:Arno Breker, Albert Speer (1940).jpg|thumb|Speer looks on as sculptor [[Arno Breker]] works]]
Speer said he was apolitical as a young man, and that he attended a Berlin Nazi rally in December&nbsp;1930 at the urging of some of his students.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=79.}}</ref> He was surprised to find Hitler dressed in a neat blue suit, rather than the brown uniform seen on Nazi Party posters, and was greatly impressed, not only with Hitler's proposals, but also with the man himself. Several weeks later he attended another rally, though this one was presided over by [[Joseph Goebbels]]. Speer was disturbed by the way Goebbels whipped the crowd into a frenzy. Despite this unease, Speer could not shake the impression Hitler had made on him. On March&nbsp;1, 1931, he applied to join the Nazi Party and became member number 474,481.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=15<U+2013>17.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=29.}}</ref>

Speer's first official position was as head of the Nazi Party's motorist association for the Berlin suburb of [[Wannsee]]; he was in fact the only Nazi in the town with a car.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=21.}}</ref>  Speer reported to the Party's leader for the [[Westend (Berlin)|West End of Berlin]], [[Karl Hanke]], who hired Speer<U+2014>without fee<U+2014>to redecorate a villa he had just rented.  Hanke was enthusiastic about the resulting work.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=21<U+2013>22.}}</ref>

In 1931, Speer surrendered his position as Tessenow's assistant due to pay cuts and moved to Mannheim, hoping to use his father's connections to get commissions.  He had little success, and his father gave him a job as manager of the elder Speer's properties.  In July&nbsp;1932, the Speers visited Berlin to help out the Party prior to the ''[[Reichstag (institution)|Reichstag]]'' elections.  While they were there, Hanke recommended the young architect to Goebbels to help renovate the Party's Berlin headquarters.  Speer, who had been about to leave with his wife for a vacation in [[East Prussia]], agreed to do the work.  When the commission was completed, Speer returned to Mannheim and remained there as Hitler took office in January&nbsp;1933.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=28<U+2013>30.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=22<U+2013>25.}}</ref> 

After the Nazis took control, Hanke recalled Speer to Berlin. Goebbels, the new Propaganda Minister, commissioned Speer to renovate [[Propagandaministerium|his Ministry's]] building on [[Wilhelmplatz]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=25<U+2013>26.}}</ref>  Speer also designed the 1933 [[May Day]] commemoration in Berlin.  In ''Inside the Third Reich'', he wrote that, on seeing the original design for the Berlin rally on Hanke's desk, he remarked that the site would resemble a ''Sh<U+00FC>tzenfest''<U+2014>a rifle club meet.<ref name = "flag"/> Hanke, now Goebbels' ministerial secretary,<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=99.}}</ref> challenged him to create a better design.  As Speer learned later, Hitler was enthusiastic about Speer's design, though Goebbels took credit for it.  Tessenow was dismissive: "Do you think you have created something?  It's showy, that's all."<ref name = "flag">{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=26<U+2013>27.}}</ref>

The organizers of the 1933 [[Nuremberg Rally|Nuremberg Nazi Party rally]] asked Speer to submit designs for the rally, bringing him into contact with Hitler for the first time. Neither the organizers nor [[Rudolf Hess]] were willing to decide whether to approve the plans, and Hess sent Speer to Hitler's Munich apartment to seek his approval.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=100<U+2013>01.}}</ref>  When Speer entered, Hitler was busy cleaning a pistol, which he laid aside to cast a brief, interested glance at the plans, and approved them without looking at the young architect.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=27<U+2013>28.}}</ref> The rally's planning won Speer his first official post, as Nazi Party "Commissioner for the Artistic and Technical Presentation of Party Rallies and Demonstrations".<ref>{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=49.}}</ref>

Speer's next major assignment was as liaison to the Berlin building trades for [[Paul Troost]]'s renovation of the Chancellery. As [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]], Hitler had a residence in the building and came outside every day to be briefed by Speer and the construction foreman on the progress of the renovations.  After one of these briefings, Hitler invited Speer to lunch, to the architect's great excitement.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=101<U+2013>03.}}</ref>  Speer almost immediately became part of Hitler's inner circle<U+2014>he was expected to call on Hitler in the morning for a walk or chat,  to provide consultation on architectural matters, and  to discuss Hitler's ideas. Most days he was invited to dinner.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=106.}}</ref>  The two men found much in common:  Hitler spoke of Speer as a "kindred spirit" for whom he had always maintained "the warmest human feelings".<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=42.}}</ref>  The young, ambitious architect was dazzled by his rapid rise and close proximity to Hitler, which guaranteed him a flood of commissions from the government and the very highest ranks of the Party.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=54.}}</ref>  Speer  testified at Nuremberg, "I belonged to a circle which consisted of other artists and his personal staff.  If Hitler had had any friends at all, I certainly would have been one of his close friends."<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=296.}}</ref>

===First Architect of the Third Reich (1934<U+2013>1939)===
{{main|Nazi architecture}}
[[Image:Lichtdom.jpg|thumb|The cathedral of light above the ''Zeppelintribune'']]
When Troost died on January&nbsp;21, 1934, Speer effectively replaced him as the Party's chief architect.  Hitler appointed Speer as head of the Chief Office for Construction.<ref>{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=60.}}</ref>  

One of Speer's first commissions after Troost's death was the ''Zeppelinfeld'' stadium<U+2014>the [[Nuremberg]] [[Nazi party rally grounds|parade grounds]] seen in [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s propaganda masterpiece, ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. This huge work was capable of holding 340,000 people.<ref name = "vat59">{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=59.}}</ref>  The [[tribune (architecture)|tribune]] was influenced by the [[Pergamon Altar]] in [[Anatolia]], but was magnified to an enormous scale.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=55.}}</ref>  Speer insisted that as many events as possible be held at night, both to give greater prominence to his lighting effects and to hide the individual Nazis, many of whom were overweight.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=131.}}</ref> Speer surrounded the site with one hundred and thirty [[anti-aircraft]] [[searchlight]]s. This created the effect of a "[[cathedral of light]]" or, as it was called by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ambassador]] [[Neville Henderson|Sir Neville Henderson]], a "cathedral of ice".<ref name = "ice">{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=58<U+2013>59.}}</ref>  Speer described this as his most beautiful work, and as the only one that has stood the test of time.<ref name = "ice"/>

Nuremberg was planned to be the site of many more official Nazi buildings, most of which were never built; for example, the [[Deutsches Stadion|German Stadium]] would have contained 400,000 spectators, while an even larger rally ground would have held half a million Nazis.<ref name = "vat59"/> While planning these structures, Speer invented the concept of "[[ruin value]]"<U+2014>that major buildings should be constructed in such a way that they would leave aesthetically pleasing ruins for thousands of years into the future. Such ruins would be a testament to the greatness of the Third Reich, just as ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] or [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ruins were symbols of the greatness of these civilizations.  Hitler enthusiastically embraced this concept, and ordered that all the Reich's important buildings be constructed in accord with it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=55<U+2013>56.}}</ref>

[[Image:La Tour Eiffel en 1937 contrast.png|thumb|Speer's German pavilion (left) facing the Soviet pavilion (right) crowned with a gigantic statue of ''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'', by [[Vera Mukhina]]]]Speer could not avoid seeing the brutal excesses of the Nazi regime, though they had little effect on him.  Shortly after the [[Night of the Long Knives]], Hitler ordered Speer to take workmen and go to the building housing the offices of [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice-Chancellor]] [[Franz von Papen]] to begin its conversion into a security headquarters, even though it was still occupied by von Papen's officials.  Speer and his group entered the building, to be confronted with a pool of blood, apparently from the body of [[Herbert von Bose]], von Papen's secretary, who had been killed there.  Speer related that the sight had no effect on him, other than to cause him to avoid that room.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=53.}}</ref>

When Hitler deprecated [[Werner March]]'s design for the [[Olympic Stadium, Berlin|Olympic Stadium]] for the [[1936 Summer Olympics]]  as too [[Modern architecture|modernistic]], Speer modified the plans by adding a stone exterior.<ref>{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=65.}}</ref> Speer designed the German Pavilion for the [[Exposition Internationale de Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|1937 international exposition in Paris]]. The German and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] pavilion sites were opposite each other.  On learning (through a clandestine look at the Soviet plans) that the Soviet design included [[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman|two colossal figures]] seemingly about to overrun the German site, Speer modified his design to include a cubic mass which would check their advance, with a huge eagle on top  looking down on the Soviet figures.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.expo2000.de/expo2000/geschichte/detail.php?wa_id=13&lang=1&s_typ=28&imag=3|title=The Paris World Exposition 1937: Monuments to dictatorship - the German and Soviet Pavilions|publisher=Website of [[Expo 2000]] (Hanover)|accessdate=2008-10-23}}</ref> Both pavilions were awarded gold medals for their designs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=81.}}</ref>

[[Image:Plan von maiestas imperii.JPG|thumb|left|A model of Speer's plan for Berlin, looking north toward the ''Volkshalle'' at the top of the frame]]
In 1937, Hitler appointed Speer as General Building Inspector for the Reich Capital with the rank of undersecretary of state in the Reich government.  The position carried with it extraordinary powers over the Berlin city government and made Speer answerable to Hitler alone.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=64.}}</ref>  It also made Speer a member of the ''Reichstag'', though the body by then [[Enabling Act of 1933|had little effective power]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=144.}}</ref>  Hitler ordered Speer to make plans to rebuild Berlin.  The plans centered around a three-mile long grand boulevard running from north to south, which Speer called the ''Prachtstrasse'', or Street of Magnificence;<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=140.}}</ref> he also referred to it as the "North-South Axis."<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=141.}}</ref>  At the north end of the boulevard, Speer planned to build the ''[[Volkshalle]]''<U+2014>a huge assembly hall with a dome which would have been over {{convert|700|ft|m|-1}} high, with floor space for 180,000 people. At the southern end of the avenue would be a huge triumphal arch; it would be almost {{convert|400|ft|m|-1}} high, and able to fit the [[Arc de Triomphe]] inside its opening. The outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939 led to the postponement, and eventual abandonment, of these plans.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=71.}}</ref>  Part of the land for the boulevard was to be obtained by consolidating Berlin's railway system.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=77.}}</ref>  Speer hired Wolters as part of his design team.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=27.}}</ref> When Speer's father saw the model for the new Berlin, he said to his son, "You've all gone completely insane."<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=158.}}</ref>

In January&nbsp;1938, Hitler asked Speer to build a new Reich Chancellery on the same site as the existing structure, and said he needed it for urgent foreign policy reasons no later than his next New Year's reception for diplomats on January&nbsp;10, 1939.  This was a huge undertaking, especially since the existing Chancellery was in full operation.  After consultation with his assistants, Speer agreed.  Although it was not until April that the site could be cleared, Speer was successful in building the large, impressive structure, which included a vast hall designed to be twice as long as the [[Hall of Mirrors (Palace of Versailles)|Hall of Mirrors]] in the [[Palace of Versailles]], in nine months.  Speer employed thousands of workers in two shifts.  Hitler, who had remained away from the project, was overwhelmed when Speer turned it over, fully furnished, two days early.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=101<U+2013>06.}}</ref>  Tessenow was less impressed, puncturing Speer's balloon by suggesting he should have taken nine years over the project.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=110.}}</ref>  The second Chancellery was damaged by the [[Battle of Berlin]] in 1945<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=273.}}</ref> and was eventually dismantled by the Soviets, its stone used for a [[Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park)|war memorial]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=351.}}</ref>

During the Chancellery project, the [[pogrom]] of [[Kristallnacht]] took place.  Speer would make no mention of it in the first draft of ''Inside the Third Reich'', and it was only on the urgent advice of his publisher that he added mention of seeing the ruins of the Central Synagogue in Berlin from his car.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=164.}}</ref>

===Wartime architect (1939<U+2013>1942)===
Speer supported the [[German invasion of Poland]] and subsequent war, though he recognized that it would lead to the postponement, at the least, of his architectural dreams.<ref name = "squad"/> In his later years, Speer, talking with his biographer-to-be [[Gitta Sereny]], explained how he felt in 1939: "Of course I was aware that [Hitler] sought world domination ... That was the whole point of my buildings.  They would  have looked grotesque if Hitler had sat still in Germany.  All I ''wanted'' was for this great man to dominate the globe."<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=186.}}</ref>

Speer placed his department at the disposal of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''.  When Hitler remonstrated, and said it was not for Speer to decide how his workers should be used, Speer simply ignored him.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=111<U+2013>12.}}</ref>  Among Speer's innovations were quick-reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris; before long, these units would be used to clear bomb sites.<ref name = "squad">{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=115}}</ref> As the war progressed, initially to great German success, Speer continued preliminary work on the Berlin and Nuremberg plans, at Hitler's insistence, but failed to convince him of the need to suspend peacetime construction projects.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=176<U+2013>78.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=180<U+2013>81.}}</ref> Speer also oversaw the construction of buildings for the ''Wehrmacht'' and ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', and developed a considerable organization to deal with all this work.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=182.}}</ref>

==Minister of Armaments==
===Appointment and increasing power===
After Minister of Armaments and War Production [[Fritz Todt]] died in a plane crash in January&nbsp;1942, Hitler appointed Speer as his successor to all of his posts.  In ''Inside the Third Reich'', Speer recounts his meeting with Hitler and his reluctance to take ministerial office, only doing so because Hitler commanded it.  Speer also states that the power-hungry but lazy [[Hermann G<U+00F6>ring]] raced to Hitler's headquarters on hearing of Todt's death, hoping to claim Todt's powers. Hitler instead presented G<U+00F6>ring with the ''fait accompli'' of Speer's appointment, causing G<U+00F6>ring to leave without even attending Todt's funeral.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=193<U+2013>96.}}</ref>

At the time of Speer's accession to the office, the German economy, unlike the British one, was not fully geared for war production.  Consumer goods were still being produced at nearly as high a level as during peacetime.  No fewer than five "Supreme Authorities" had jurisdiction over armament production<U+2014>one of which, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, had declared in November 1941 that conditions did not permit an increase in armament production.  Few women were employed in the factories, which were running only one shift.  One evening soon after his appointment, Speer went to visit a Berlin armament factory; he found no one on the premises.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=139<U+2013>41.}}</ref>

Speer overcame these difficulties by centralizing power over the war economy in himself.  Backed by Hitler's strong support (the dictator stated, "Speer, I'll sign anything that comes from you."<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=143.}}</ref>), he divided the armament field according to weapon system, with experts rather than civil servants overseeing each department.  No department head could be older than 55, no deputy older than 40.  Over these departments was a central planning committee headed by Speer, which took increasing responsibility for war production, and as time went by, for the German economy itself.  According to the minutes of a conference at ''Wehrmacht'' High Command in March&nbsp;1942, "It is only Speer's word that counts nowadays.  He can interfere in all departments.  Already he overrides all departments ... On the whole, Speer's attitude is to the point."<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=142<U+2013>44.}}</ref>

[[Image:Adolf Hitler in Paris 1940.jpg|thumb|Hitler visits Paris in 1940 with Speer (left) and Breker]]
While Speer had tremendous power, he was of course subordinate to Hitler, and Nazi officials sometimes went around the architect by seeking direct orders from the dictator.  When Speer ordered peacetime building work suspended, the ''[[Gauleiter]]s'' (Nazi Party district leaders) obtained an exemption for their pet projects.  When Speer sought the appointment of Hanke as a labor czar to optimize the use of German labor, Hitler, under the influence of [[Martin Bormann]], instead appointed [[Fritz Sauckel]].  Rather than increasing female labor and taking other steps to better organize German labor, as Speer favored, Sauckel advocated importing labor from the occupied nations<U+2014>and did so, using the most brutal methods.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=146<U+2013>50.}}</ref>

On December&nbsp;10, 1943, Speer visited the underground ''[[Mittelwerk]]'' [[V-2 rocket]] factory that used [[concentration camp]] labor (5.7% of the work force died that month).  Shocked by the conditions there, and to ensure the workers were in good enough shape to perform the labor,<ref>{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|pp=175<U+2013>76.}}</ref> Speer ordered improved conditions for the workers and the construction of the above-ground [[Mittelbau-Dora|Dora camp]].  In spite of these changes, half of the workers at Mittelwerk eventually died.  Speer later commented, "<nowiki>[t]</nowiki>he conditions for these prisoners were in fact barbarous, and a sense of profound involvement and personal guilt seizes me whenever I think of them."<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=370.}}</ref>

By 1943, the Allies had gained air superiority over Germany, and bombings of German cities and industry had become commonplace.  However, the Allies in their [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing campaign]] did not concentrate on industry, and Speer, with his improvisational skill, was able to overcome bombing losses.  In spite of these losses, German production of tanks more than doubled in 1943, production of planes increased by 80%, and production time for submarines was decreased from one year to two months.  Production would continue to increase until the second half of 1944, by which time enough equipment to supply 270 army divisions was being produced<U+2014>although the ''Wehrmacht'' had only 150 divisions in the field.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=168<U+2013>70.}}</ref>

In January&nbsp;1944, Speer fell ill and was away from the office for three months.  During his absence, a number of his rivals (notably Himmler, G<U+00F6>ring, and Bormann) attempted to have some of his powers permanently transferred to them.  In April, they succeeded in having him deprived of responsibility for construction, and Speer promptly sent Hitler a bitter letter, concluding with an offer of his resignation.  Judging Speer indispensable to the war effort, Field Marshal [[Erhard Milch]] persuaded Hitler to try to get his minister to reconsider.  Hitler sent Milch to Speer with a message stating that he still regarded Speer as highly as ever.  According to Milch, the angry minister responded, "The [[F<U+00FC>hrer]] can kiss my ass!"<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=210.}}</ref>  After lengthy arguments, Milch successfully persuaded Speer to withdraw his offer of resignation, on the condition his powers were restored.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=207<U+2013>12.}}</ref>  On April&nbsp;23, 1944, Speer went to see Hitler who agreed that "everything [will] stay as it was, [Speer will] remain the head of all German construction".<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1981|pp=232<U+2013>33.}}</ref>

=== Fall of the Reich ===
Speer's name was included on the list of members of a post-Hitler government drawn up by the conspirators behind the [[July 20 plot|July&nbsp;1944 assassination plot]] to kill Hitler. However, the list had a question mark and the annotation "to be won over" by his name, which likely saved him from the extensive purges that followed the scheme's failure.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=224<U+2013>26.}}</ref>

By February&nbsp;1945, Speer, who had long concluded that the war was lost, was working to supply areas about to be occupied with food and materials to get them through the hard times ahead.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=482.}}</ref>  On March&nbsp;19, 1945, Hitler issued his [[Nero Decree]], ordering a [[scorched earth]] policy in both Germany and the occupied territories.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=250<U+2013>51.}}</ref> Hitler's order, by its terms, deprived Speer of any power to interfere with the decree, and Speer went to confront Hitler, telling him the war was lost.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=486<U+2013>92.}}</ref>  Hitler gave Speer twenty-four hours to reconsider his position, at the end of which time Speer answered, "I stand unconditionally behind you."<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|pp=4<U+2013>6.}}</ref>  However, he demanded the exclusive power to implement the Nero Decree, and Hitler signed an order to that effect.  Using this order, Speer worked to persuade generals and ''Gauleiters'' to evade the Nero Decree and avoid needless sacrifice of personnel and destruction of industry that would be needed after the war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=498<U+2013>504.}}</ref>

Speer managed to reach a relatively safe area near [[Hamburg]] as the Nazi regime finally collapsed, but decided on a final, risky visit to Berlin to see Hitler one more time.<ref name = "visit"/>  Speer stated at Nuremberg, "I felt that it was my duty not to run away like a coward, but to stand up to him again."<ref>{{Citation

Hitler seemed calm and somewhat distracted, and the two  had a long, disjointed conversation in which the dictator defended his actions and informed Speer of his intent to commit suicide and have his body burned.  In the published edition of ''Inside the Third Reich'', Speer relates that he confessed to Hitler that he had defied the Nero Decree, but then assured Hitler of his personal loyalty, bringing tears to the dictator's eyes.<ref name = "visit"/>  However, Speer's original draft of his memoirs lacks this exchange, and contains an explicit denial that any confession or emotional exchange took place, as had been alleged in a French magazine article.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=528<U+2013>531.}}</ref>

On April&nbsp;23, Speer left the ''F<U+00FC>hrerbunker'', with Hitler curtly bidding him farewell.  Speer toured the damaged Chancellery one last time before leaving Berlin to return to Hamburg.<ref name = "visit">{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=263<U+2013>70.}}</ref> On April&nbsp;29, the day before his suicide, Hitler prepared his [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|final political testament]]. That document excluded Speer from the Cabinet and specified that Speer was to be replaced by his subordinate, Karl-Otto Saur.<ref>{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=234.}}</ref>

==Nuremberg trial==
After Hitler's death, Speer offered his services to the so-called [[Flensburg government|Flensburg Government]], headed by Hitler's successor, [[Karl D<U+00F6>nitz]], and took a significant role in that short-lived regime.  On May&nbsp;15, the Americans arrived and asked Speer if he would be willing to provide information on the effects of the air war.  Speer agreed, and over the next several days, provided information on a broad range of subjects.  On May&nbsp;23, the Allies arrested the members of the Flensburg Government, bringing Nazi Germany to a formal end.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=273<U+2013>81.}}</ref>

Speer was taken to several internment centers for Nazi officials and interrogated.  In September&nbsp;1945, Speer was told that he would be tried for war crimes, and several days later, he was taken to Nuremberg and incarcerated there.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=561.}}</ref>  Speer was indicted on all four possible counts: first, participating in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of [[crime against peace]], second, planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace, third, [[war crime|war crimes]], and lastly, [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=285.}}</ref>

[[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice|Justice]] [[Robert H. Jackson|Robert Jackson]], the chief U.S. prosecutor at Nuremberg, alleged, "Speer joined in planning and executing the program to dragoon prisoners of war and foreign workers into German war industries, which waxed in output while the workers waned in starvation."<ref>{{Citation

<blockquote>
In political life, there is a responsibility for a man's own sector.  For that he is of course fully responsible.  But beyond that there is a collective responsibility when he has been one of the leaders.  Who else is to be held responsible for the course of events, if not the closest associates around the Chief of State?<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=516.}}</ref></blockquote>

Speer also testified that he had planned to kill Hitler in early 1945 by dropping a canister of poison gas into the bunker's air intake.<ref name = "gas"/>  He said his efforts were frustrated by a high wall that had been built around the air intake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=245<U+2013>46.}}</ref>  Speer stated his motive was despair at realizing that Hitler was confusing his fate with that of the German people.<ref name = "gas">{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=293<U+2013>97.}}</ref>  Speer's supposed assassination plan subsequently met with some skepticism, with Speer's architectural rival, [[Hermann Giesler]] sneering, "the second most powerful man in the state did not have a ladder".<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=246.}}</ref>

Speer was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, though he was acquitted on the other two counts.  On October&nbsp;1, 1946, he was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment.<ref name = "judgment">{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|pp=281<U+2013>82.}}</ref>  While two of the eight judges (one Soviet and one American) initially advocated the death penalty for Speer, the other judges did not, and a compromise sentence was reached "after two days' discussion and some rather bitter horse-trading".<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=29.}}</ref>  Twelve of the defendants were sentenced to death (including Bormann, in absentia) and three acquitted; only seven of the defendants were sentenced to imprisonment.<ref name = "judgment"/>  They languished in the cells at Nuremberg as the Allies debated where, and under what conditions, they should be incarcerated.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=596.}}</ref>

==Imprisonment==
{{main|Spandau Prison}}

On July&nbsp;18, 1947, Speer and his six fellow prisoners, all former high officials of the Nazi regime, were flown from Nuremberg to Berlin under heavy guard.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|pp=65<U+2013>67.}}</ref>  The prisoners were taken to Spandau Prison in the British Sector of what would become [[West Berlin]], where they would be assigned and referred to by number, with Speer designated as Number Five.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|pp=66<U+2013>67.}}</ref>  Initially, the prisoners were kept in solitary confinement for all but half an hour a day, and were not permitted to address each other or their guards.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=309<U+2013>10.}}</ref>  As time passed, the strict regimen was relaxed, especially during the three months in four that the three Western powers were in control<U+2014>the [[Allied Control Council|four occupying powers]] took overall control on a monthly rotation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=602.}}</ref>  Speer considered himself an outcast even among his fellow prisoners for his acceptance of responsibility at Nuremberg.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|p=244.}}</ref>

Speer made a deliberate effort to make as productive use of his time as possible. He wrote, "I am obsessed with the idea of using this time of confinement for writing a book of major importance ... That could mean transforming prison cell into scholar's den."<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|p=75.}}</ref> Due to an offer from a sympathetic orderly, he was able to have his writings, which eventually amounted to 20,000 sheets, sent to Wolters. By 1954, Speer had completed his memoirs, which became the basis of ''Inside the Third Reich'', and which Wolters arranged to have transcribed onto 1,100 typewritten pages.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=316.}}</ref>  He was also able to send letters and financial instructions, and to obtain writing paper and letters from the outside.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=310<U+2013>11.}}</ref>  His many letters to his children, all secretly transmitted,  eventually formed the basis for ''Spandau:  The Secret Diaries''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=672.}}</ref>

With the draft memoir complete and clandestinely transmitted, Speer sought a new project.  He found one while taking his daily exercise, walking in circles around the prison yard.  Measuring the path's distance carefully, Speer set out to walk the distance from Berlin to Heidelberg.  He then expanded his idea into a worldwide journey, visualizing the places he was "traveling" through while walking the path around the prison yard. Speer ordered guidebooks and other materials about the nations through which he imagined he was passing, so as to envision as accurate a picture as possible.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=316<U+2013>17.}}</ref>  Meticulously calculating every meter traveled, and mapping distances to the real-world geography, he began in northern Germany, passed through Asia by a southern route before entering Siberia, then crossed the [[Bering Strait]] and continued southwards, finally ending his sentence in central Mexico.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|p=447.}}</ref>

Speer devoted much of his time and energy to reading books from the prison's library, which was organized by fellow prisoner and ex-[[Grand Admiral]] [[Erich Raeder]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|pp=108<U+2013>09.}}</ref> Prisoners could also have books sent over from the local branch of the Berlin library,<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|p=112.}}</ref> and, later, from the central library.<ref name = "library">{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|p=195.}}</ref>  Speer was a voracious reader and he completed well over 500 books in the first three years alone.<ref>{{Citation

==Release and later life==
Speer's release from prison was a worldwide media event, with both the street outside Spandau and the lobby of the Berlin hotel where Speer spent his first hours of freedom in over twenty years crowded with reporters and photographers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=320<U+2013>21.}}</ref> However, Speer said little, reserving most comments for a major interview published in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in November&nbsp;1966, in which he again took personal responsibility for crimes of the Nazi regime.<ref>{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|pp=333-34.}}</ref>  Abandoning plans to return to architecture (two proposed partners died shortly before his release),<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|p=441.}}</ref> he revised and published two [[autobiography|autobiographical]] books based on the diary entries he had made in prison, as well as a third about the SS. His books, most notably ''Inside the Third Reich'' (in German, ''Erinnerungen'', or ''Reminiscences''<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=5.}}</ref>) and ''Spandau: The Secret Diaries'', provide a unique and personal look into the personalities of the Nazi era, and have become much valued by historians. Speer was aided in shaping the works by [[Joachim Fest]] and [[Wolf Jobst Siedler]] from the publishing house Ullstein.<ref>{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|pp=329<U+2013>30.}}</ref> Following his publication of his bestselling books, he donated a considerable amount of money to Jewish charities.  According to Siedler, these donations were as high as eighty percent of his royalties.  Speer kept the donations anonymous, both for fear of rejection, and for fear of being called a hypocrite.<ref>{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=348.}}</ref>

Speer made himself widely available to historians and other enquirers.<ref name="harvnb1997">{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=354.}}</ref>  He traveled to [[London]] under an assumed name in 1973 to participate in a [[British Broadcasting Company|BBC]] program about bombing in World War II, leading to a brief detention when British immigration authorities discovered his true identity (Speer was allowed into the country for two days).<ref name="harvnb1997"/> While in London eight years later to participate in another BBC program, Speer suffered a stroke and died on September&nbsp;1, 1981.<ref name="harvnb"/>

Even to the end of his life, Speer continued to question his actions under Hitler.  In his final book, ''Infiltration'', he asks, "What would have happened if Hitler had asked me to make decisions that required the utmost hardness? ... How far would I have gone? ... If I had occupied a different position, to what extent would I have ordered atrocities if Hitler had told me to do so?"<ref name = "question">{{Harvnb|Speer|1981|p=12<U+2013>13.}}</ref>  Speer does not answer the questions.<ref name = "question"/>

==Legacy and controversy==
===Architectural legacy===
[[Image:Berlin Treptow Ehrenmal 11.jpg|thumb|The Soviet War Memorial, constructed using stone from Speer's Chancellery]]
Little remains of Speer's architectural works, other than the plans and photographs.  No buildings designed by Speer in the Nazi era remain in Berlin; a double row of lampposts along the [[Stra<U+00DF>e des 17. Juni|Strasse des 17. Juni]] designed by Speer still stands.<ref>{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=75.}}</ref>  The tribune of the ''Zeppelinfeld'' stadium in Nuremberg, though partly demolished, may also be seen.<ref>{{Citation

===Actions regarding the Jews===
As General Building Inspector, Speer was responsible for the Central Department for Resettlement.<ref name = "Berlinjews">{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=116.}}</ref>  From 1939 onwards, the Department used the [[Nuremberg Laws]] to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing.<ref name = "Berlinjews"/>  Eventually, 75,000 Jews were displaced by these measures.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=120.}}</ref>  Speer was aware of these activities, and inquired as to their progress<ref name = "memo">{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=119.}}</ref><U+2014>at least one original memo from Speer so inquiring still exists,<ref name = "memo"/> as does the Chronicle of the Department's activities, kept by Wolters.<ref name = "archives"/>  The Nuremberg prosecutors did not have a copy of the Chronicle.<ref>{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=367.}}</ref>

Following his release from Spandau, Speer presented to the [[German Federal Archives]] an edited version of the Chronicle, stripped by Wolters of any mention of the Jews.  When historian [[David Irving]] discovered discrepancies between the edited Chronicle and other documents, Wolters explained the situation to Speer, who responded by suggesting to Wolters that the relevant pages of the original Chronicle should "cease to exist".<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=226<U+2013>27.}}</ref>  Wolters did not destroy the Chronicle, and, as his friendship with Speer deteriorated, allowed access to the original Chronicle to doctoral student Matthias Schmidt (who, after obtaining his doctorate developed his thesis into a book, ''Albert Speer: The End of a Myth'').<ref>{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=359<U+2013>61.}}</ref>  The original Chronicle reached the Archives in 1983, after both Speer and Wolters had died.<ref name = "archives">{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=124.}}</ref>

===Knowledge of the Holocaust===
Speer maintained at Nuremberg and in his memoirs that he had no actual knowledge of the Holocaust.  In ''Inside the Third Reich'', he wrote that in mid-1944, he was told by Hanke (by then ''Gauleiter'' of [[Lower Silesia]]) that the minister should never accept an invitation to inspect a concentration camp in neighboring [[Upper Silesia]], as "he had seen something there which he was not permitted to describe and moreover could not describe".<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=375<U+2013>76.}}</ref>  Speer later concluded that Hanke must have been speaking of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], and blamed himself for not inquiring further of Hanke or seeking information from Himmler or Hitler:

<blockquote>"These seconds <nowiki>[when Hanke told Speer this, and Speer did not inquire]</nowiki> were uppermost in my mind when I stated to the international court at the Nuremberg Trial that as an important member of the leadership of the Reich, I had to share the total responsibility for all that had happened.  For from that moment on, I was inescapably contaminated morally; from fear of discovering something which might have made me turn from my course, I had closed my eyes ... Because I failed at that time, I still feel, to this day, responsible for Auschwitz in a wholly personal sense."<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=376.}}</ref></blockquote>

Much of the controversy over Speer's knowledge of the Holocaust has centered around his presence at the [[Posen Conference]] on October&nbsp;6, 1943, at which Himmler [[Posen speech|gave a speech]] detailing the ongoing Holocaust to Nazi leaders.  Himmler said, "The grave decision had to be taken to cause this people to vanish from the earth ... In the lands we occupy, the Jewish question will be dealt with by the end of the year."<ref>{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|pp=167<U+2013>68.}}</ref>  Speer is mentioned several times in the speech, and Himmler seems to address him directly.<ref>{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=168.}}</ref>  In ''Inside the Third Reich'', Speer mentions his own address to the officials (which took place earlier in the day) but does not mention Himmler's speech.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=184<U+2013>85.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=312<U+2013>13.}}</ref>

[[Image:Bronze eagle from the german rechs chancellery.jpg|thumb|Bronze eagle from Speer's Chancellery, now in the [[Imperial War Museum]]]]
In 1971, American historian Erich Goldhagen published an article arguing that Speer was present for Himmler's speech.  According to Fest's biography of Speer, "Goldhagen's accusation certainly would have been more convincing"<ref name = "Goldhagen"/> had he not placed supposed incriminating statements linking Speer with the Holocaust in quotation marks, attributed to Himmler, which were in fact invented by Goldhagen.<ref name = "Goldhagen"/>  In response, after considerable research in the German Federal Archives in [[Koblenz]], Speer said he had left Posen around noon (long before Himmler's speech) in order to journey to Hitler's headquarters at [[K<U+0119>trzyn|Rastenburg]].<ref name = "Goldhagen">{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=185<U+2013>87.}}</ref> In ''Inside the Third Reich'', published before the Goldhagen article, Speer recalled that on the evening after the conference, many Nazi officials were so drunk that they needed help boarding the special train which was to take them to a meeting with Hitler.<ref>{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=313.}}</ref>  One of his biographers, Dan van der Vat, suggests this necessarily implies he must have still been present at Posen then, and must have heard Himmler's speech.<ref>{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=169.}}</ref>  In response to Goldhagen's article, Speer alleged that in writing ''Inside the Third Reich'', he erred in reporting an incident that happened at another conference at Posen a year later, as happening in 1943.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=397.}}</ref>

In 2007, ''The Daily Telegraph'' reported that documents had surfaced indicating that Speer had approved the allocation of materials for the expansion of Auschwitz, after two of his assistants toured the facility on a day when almost a thousand Jews were murdered.  The documents supposedly bore annotations in Speer's own handwriting.  Speer biographer Gitta Sereny denied that Speer would have been personally aware of such activities.<ref name = "telegraph">

One problem with assessments of Speer's knowledge or complicity in the Holocaust comes from his status in post-war Germany<U+2014>he became a symbol for people who were involved with the Nazi regime yet did not have (or claimed not to have had) any part in the regime's atrocities. As film director Heinrich Breloer remarked, "[Speer created] a market for people who said, 'Believe me, I didn't know anything about [the Holocaust]. Just look at the ''F<U+00FC>hrer's'' friend, he didn't know about it either.'"<ref name = "telegraph"/>
