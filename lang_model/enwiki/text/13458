==Production==
On March 3, 2012, the shorts premiered as part of the ''[[DC Nation]]'' block, produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]]. They are aired alongside ''[[Green Lantern: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', as well as with ''[[Beware the Batman]]'' & ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' in 2013.<ref>[http://screenrant.com/beware-the-batman-cartoon-network-2013-yman-134712/ CGI <U+2018>Beware The Batman<U+2019> Coming to Cartoon Network in 2013 | Screen Rant].</ref> On June 8, 2012, Cartoon Network announced that it would revive the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series as ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'', based on the New Teen Titans shorts. It was then aired on the DC Nation block in 2013.<ref name="cbm">[http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/johnarturo/news/?a=61229 ComicBookMovie.com - PRESS RELEASE: All-New TEEN TITANS GO!

In 2011, Sam Register has promised new content every week on the block in addition to the shorts: "...whether that's a new show or an interstitial or a short."<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcRWyWeGGN8 YouTube: DC Nation and Beware the Batman Preview]</ref>
