The '''Siebenschneiderstein''' (''S<U+00F6>benschniedersteen'') is a [[glacial erratic]] on the [[island]] of [[R<U+00FC>gen]]. It lies about 30&nbsp;metres away from the [[cliff]]s of ''Gellort'' on the [[Baltic Sea]] beach, one kilometre northwest of [[Cape Arkona]]. It has a [[mass (physics)|mass]] of 165&nbsp;tonnes and a volume of 61&nbsp;m<U+00B3>. It belongs, like about 20 other erratics, to the legally protected [[geotope]]s on the Island of R<U+00FC>gen.

The rock is not the biggest erratic on R<U+00FC>gen (that is the [[Buskam]] at 600&nbsp;m<U+00B3>), but it is the fourth largest and marks the northern point of the island and hence the northernmost point of [[Eastern Germany]].
