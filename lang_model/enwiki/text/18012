'''Sheila Janet Carey''' (n<U+00E9>e '''Taylor''', born 12 August 1946, [[Coventry]], England)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ta/sheila-taylor-carey-1.html |title=Sheila Taylor-Carey Biography and Olympic Results &#124; Olympics at |publisher=Sports-reference.com |date= |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref> is a British athlete who represented the [[United Kingdom]] at the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] and [[1972 Summer Olympics]], as well as the [[Commonwealth Games]] of 1970 and 1974. She set a new British record for the Women's 1500m at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, and was one of seven athletes in that event to beat the pre-Games world record. At the Commonwealth Games of 1970 she was part of two teams which achieved record-breaking success.

==Career==

At the 1968 Olympics in [[Mexico]] Carey (competing under her maiden name) achieved fourth place in the Women's 800m Final, coming in behind the [[United States]]' [[Madeline Manning]]. Carey went on to achieve success as part of two 4 x 800m relay teams representing Great Britain at the [[1970 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Edinburgh]]. The teams made record-breaking achievements, and Carey herself set the fastest time in the heats, but she failed to match this success in the final after falling in the early stages of the race. Her final national achievement came at the 1972 Olympics in [[Munich]] where she came in fifth in the Women's 1500m Final, setting a new British record of 4min 04.8sec. The race was won by the Soviet Union's [[Lyudmila Bragina]] and saw the first seven runners beating the pre-Games world record. Carey continued to represent the UK on an international level through 1973 and 1974, including competing in the 1500m UK v Hungary match at [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]] in August 1973, where she finished second behind [[Joan Allison]], before making her final appearance at the [[1974 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand. There she was eliminated in her heat of the 800m, after finishing eleventh out of thirteen starters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/athletics-heroes/displayhero.asp?HeroID=7910 |title=Sheila Carey |publisher=Sporting-heroes.net |date= |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref>

After retiring from international athletics Carey later went on to teach [[Physical Education]] in the United Kingdom, working for many years at [[Exhall Grange School]], a school for children with [[visual impairment|sight loss]] and other disabilities, near [[Coventry]] in 1988.<ref name=Appeal>{{cite news|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Plans+laid,+now+we+need+the+money!%3B+NEWSFOCUS%3A+AS+FUND-RAISING+APPEAL...-a060463368|title= Plans laid, now we need the money!|publisher= |work= Coventry Evening Telegraph|date= 15 March 1999|accessdate= 27 December 2011}}</ref> She retired from full time at Exhall Grange in 2009 but regularly returns if asked. In 2012, she carried the [[Olympic torch]] through [[Warwick]] as part of the [[2012 Summer Olympics torch relay|relay]] ahead of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London Olympic Games]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://leamingtonobserver.co.uk/2012/07/05/news-Relay-arrives-in-Warwick-44393.html |title=Relay arrives in Warwick |publisher= |newspaper=Leamington Observer |date=4 July 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> Her school also did a mini version of the Olympic Games, with lucky chosen people from the school carrying the torch down the road and station events on the field and playground played.

She has been married to Pete since 1968. They have two daughters and five grandchildren.
