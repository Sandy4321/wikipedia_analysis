The '''Pajama Sam''' series is a collection of [[point-and-click]] children's adventure and puzzle games originally created by [[Humongous Entertainment]].

==Character==
{{Expand section|date=January 2009}}
The young titular character himself, Pajama Sam, is shown having light turquoise hair and skin and wearing a pair of blue [[blanket sleeper|footed pajamas]] and a red cape. Many of Sam's adventures involve him emulating his hero, the comic book superhero ''Pajama-Man'', and seeking to physically conquer his fears and dislikes (e.g. darkness, thunder and lightning, healthy foods) and [[altruism|altruistically]] help others.

Sam is young and a little naive, and obviously has an active imagination. Sam befriends many inanimate objects throughout his adventures, such as a mining cart named King (No Need to Hide when It's Dark Outside), a wooden boat named Otto (NNHIDO), and a piece of broccoli named Florette (You Are What You Eat from Your Head to Your Feet). These companions assist him in the games.

Sam has a tendency to be inattentive, impatient, and to rush into situations without having the full story. Yet he is also depicted as being friendly and going out of his way to be nice to characters that he encounters- even enemies or former enemies.

==Games==
===Main Adventure Games===

====''Summary of All Games''====
All games consist of three parts: the [[tutorial]], the actual game, including the side objective, and the credits. The world changes every time a new game is started (even though the main and side objectives stay the same), so it is impossible to explain the complex storyline. The games consist of Pajama Sam finding objects in the world and using them somewhere else. A [[cut scene]] is usually played if the right item is used. You may save your progress at any time if you have to stop.

{{Main|Pajama Sam In: No Need To Hide When It's Dark Outside }}
Pajama Sam, frustrated with his fear of the dark, enters the "Land of Darkness" through his closet, hoping to capture the [[Anthropomorphic|anthropomorphized]] Darkness (as happens in his ''Pajama Man'' comic). However, upon entering, he is seized by a group of trees acting as [[customs]] and has his superhero items confiscated. The game revolves around Sam attempting to retrieve his purple '''Pajama Sam [[mask]]''', '''Signature-Edition, All-Metal Pajama Man [[Lunch box|Lunch Box]]''' (or Portable Bad Guy Containment Unit), and his '''Illuminator Mark 5 Jr. [[Flashlight]]'''. Also, as a side objective, Sam has to collect pairs of socks scattered throughout the world. If he does, they will all be loaded into a washing machine. Eventually, the washing machine overflows. The voice of Pajama Sam, as with many of the later games, is provided by [[Pamela Segall]].

Note: This game has no known game setup, as Thunder and Lighting and You Are What You Eat do.

During a scary thunderstorm, Pajama Sam journeys through his attic and up into the clouds to World Wide Weather.
