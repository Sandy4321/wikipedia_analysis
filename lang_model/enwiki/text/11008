{{nihongo|'''Tidus'''|<U+30C6><U+30A3><U+30FC><U+30C0>|T<U+012B>da}} is the main [[protagonist]] in the [[Square-Enix]] [[Computer role-playing game|role-playing video game]] ''[[Final Fantasy X]]''.  As the leading character, the player controls Tidus through the world based in the game, manipulating his actions through the unfolding storyline in traditional ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' style.  ''Final Fantasy X'' was the first title of the ''Final Fantasy'' series featured on the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]].

The storyline of ''Final Fantasy X'' revolves around Tidus, a rising [[blitzball]] star player from [[Locations in Spira#Zanarkand Ruins|Zanarkand]].  After a mysterious creature called "[[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#The destruction of Zanarkand|Sin]]" attacked his hometown, Tidus was seemingly transported to the world of [[Spira (Final Fantasy X)|Spira]].  Lost, confused, and feeling out of place, Tidus soon meets a newly-fledged [[Summoner (Final Fantasy)|summoner]], [[Yuna]], and her [[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Militant factions|guardians]].  The summoner is soon to set out on a pilgrimage in an attempt to put an end to the very creature that attacked Tidus' city, and by joining them, Tidus hopes he will find his way home.

James Arnold Taylor, the English voice actor for Tidus, has mentioned that Tidus' maturity goes through stages of development during the story, and that his voice reflects this, i.e., the points of narration offered by Tidus sound mature, while those from when the game began had a higher pitch. {{audio|JAT.ogg|''James Arnold Taylor interview''}} Additionally, since the player can name Tidus in ''Final Fantasy X'', he is not referred to by name, nor is he referred to as Tidus on X-2, instead he is known as 'Him' during that game.

==Character design==
The game's scenario writer, [[Kazushige Nojima]], has expressed that the relationship between the player and the main character in a ''Final Fantasy'' title is always something he's concerned with, and that when penning ''Final Fantasy X'', he wanted to try something new.  He wanted to attempt establishing a connection between the player and character such that <U+2014> since both are finding themselves in a new world <U+2014> the player's progress through that world and growing knowledge about it would be reflected in Tidus' own ever-developing understanding, a connection allowed to the player through Tidus' first-person narration of most of ''Final Fantasy X'', in which the player (controlling Tidus) advances that narration.<ref name="interviews">{{cite web | author=Square-Enix North America Site Staff | year=2001 | title=Behind The Game The Creators | url=http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/FFX/btg/creators.html#1 | work=[http://www.square-enix.com/na/ Square-Enix North America] | accessdate=12 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

For his part, Character Designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] has expressed that <U+2014> after designing serious and moody main characters for ''Final Fantasy VII'' and ''Final Fantasy VIII'' <U+2014> he wanted to give Tidus a cheerful attitude and appearance, which is reflected in the name Kazushige Nojima chose for him (''Tiida'' is the [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]] word for "sun").<ref name="sun">{{Cite book | year=2001 | editor=Sam Kennedy and Gary Steinman | title=Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine August, 2001 | pages=96 | language=English | publisher=Ziff Davis Media}}</ref><ref name="sun2">{{cite web | author=Shella | year=2003 | title=Tetsuya Nomura 20s | url=http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=81&more=1 | work=[http://flaregamer.com FLAREgamer] | accessdate=13 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He's also explained that he wanted his clothing and accessories to suggest a relationship with the sea.  For example, his outfit bears a distinctive blue theme, and the symbol of Tidus' blitzball team <U+2014> which appears on his clothing <U+2014> is designed after a fishing hook, while also designed such that it's an amalgamation of the letters "J" and "T" (the first letters of Tidus' name and that of his father, Jecht).<ref name="clothing">{{cite web | author=Shella | year=2003 | title=Tetsuya Nomura 20s | url=http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=81&more=1 | work=[http://flaregamer.com FLAREgamer] | accessdate=13 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Nomura has also mentioned that a contrast between the lead male and female protagonists was established by Yuna's name meaning "night" in Okinawan.<ref name="yunaname">{{cite web | author=Shella | year=2003 | title=Tetsuya Nomura 20s | url=http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=81&more=1 | work=[http://flaregamer.com FLAREgamer] | accessdate=13 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref>  This contrast is also represented with the items required to empower their Celestial Weapons: the Sun Sigil and the Sun Crest for Tidus', and the Moon Sigil and Moon Crest for Yuna's.

Like the other characters in ''Final Fantasy X'', Tidus' abilities are built around a classic ''Final Fantasy'' job class, in his case that of the [[Final Fantasy character classes#Fighter/Knight/Warrior|Fighter]] class, which is normally considered a balanced melee class.  However, Tidus also features many abilities from the [[Final Fantasy character classes#Time/Space Mage|Time Mage]] class in the form of supportive spells for himself and his group.

Because he is never directly referred to by name during audible dialogue <U+2014> due to the player having the option to change his default name <U+2014> the pronunciation of his name among fans is sometimes unclear, though its direct [[katakana]] to [[romaji]] form would be "Teeda."  As such, his name as featured in ''Final Fantasy X'' is pronounced "Tee-dus."  This was confirmed in dialogue from ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' <U+2014> which featured the character in a cameo <U+2014> and by interviews with James Arnold Taylor, Tidus' English voice actor.<ref name="interview">{{cite web | author=Square-Enix North America Site Staff | year=2001 | title=Behind The Game Actors <U+2014> Tidus | url=http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/FFX/btg/taylor.html | work=[http://www.square-enix.com/na/ Square-Enix North America] | accessdate=12 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref> In ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', however, [[Selphie Tilmitt]] pronounces his name "Tie-dus," which has led to more confusion amongst fans.

==Biography==
===Final Fantasy X===
The game begins with an in-game cutscene showcasing the party of main characters around a campfire backdropped by the wreckage of Zanarkand.  As the camera work focuses on Tidus while he ascends a small hill and looks over the ruins, it is accompanied by the game's opening line, spoken by Tidus: "Listen to my story."

The suggestion that ''Final Fantasy X'' is Tidus' story is enforced by Tidus' first-person narration throughout much of the game, and is mentioned at various points in the game's dialogue.<ref name="story">'''Auron:''' "This is it.  This is your story.  It all begins here."<span style="font-size: 90%;">(''Final Fantasy X'')</span></ref><ref name="story2">'''Auron:''' "Look not to others for knowledge.  This is your journey, too." ... / '''Tidus:''' "...Auron's right.  This is our... This is my story."<span style="font-size: 90%;">(''Final Fantasy X'')</span></ref><ref name="story3">'''Tidus:''' "I'll go ask Yunalesca.  She's got to know something." / '''Rikku:''' "You really think she'll help you?" / '''Tidus:''' "I don't know, but I have to try.  This is my story.  It'll go the way I want it... or I'll end it here."<span style="font-size: 90%;">(''Final Fantasy X'')</span></ref><ref name="story4">'''Tidus:''' "Everyone! This is the last time we fight together, okay?" / '''Wakka:''' "Huh?" / '''Tidus:''' "What I'm trying to say is... after we beat Yu Yevon, I'll disappear!" / '''Lulu:''' "What are you talking about?" / '''Tidus:''' "I'm saying goodbye!" / '''Rikku:''' "Not now!" / '''Tidus:''' "I know it's selfish... but this is my story!"<span style="font-size: 90%;">(''Final Fantasy X'')</span></ref> Tidus then recounts how events have lead to the present.  At the beginning of his role in the story, Tidus, an inhabitant of Zanarkand, is preparing to play blitzball in the Jecht Memorial Cup <U+2014> a tournament in honor of his lost father, Jecht.  Ten years prior to the events of the game, Jecht mysteriously disappeared while on a blitzball training expedition out at sea.<ref name="jecht">'''Zanar:''' "I was in a coffee shop, running away from home when I heard the news.  Our hero, Jecht, gone, vanished into thin air!" .../ '''Zanar:''' "Anyways... Ten years later, the Jecht Memorial Cup tournament is today!"<span style="font-size: 90%;">(''Final Fantasy X'')</span></ref><ref name="jecht2">'''Tidus:''' "Sounds like him, but it can't be him." / '''Yuna:''' "Why not?" / '''Tidus:''' "My old man, he died.  Ten years ago, off the coast of Zanarkand." / '''Yuna:''' "I'm sorry." / '''Tidus:''' "He went out to sea for training one day... and never came back.  And no one's seen him since then." / '''Yuna:''' "Why, that's the day that Jecht came to Spira.  It's true! I first met Jecht ten years and three months ago!"<span style="font-size: 90%;">(''Final Fantasy X'')</span></ref> A successful blitzball player, Tidus felt the pressure to match, if not surpass, his father's skill.  Tidus holds animosity toward Jecht for this and other reasons, including the fact that his mother would ignore Tidus in favor of giving attention to Jecht and because his disappearance led to his mother giving up the will to live.<ref name="jecht3">'''Yuna:''' "What would you do if you found him?" / '''Tidus:''' "Who knows? I thought he died ten years ago.  Well... I'd probably just smack him one.  After everything he put Mom and me through.  And because he was famous, I was always... Well, you should know, Yuna.  Your father's famous, too.  Everyone in Spira knows him, right? Ain't it tough?"<span style="font-size: 90%;">(''Final Fantasy X'')</span></ref><ref name="jecht4">'''Tidus:''' "I think I just figured something out." / '''Yuna:''' "What?" / '''Tidus:''' "Why I hate my old man." ... / '''Tidus:''' "Whenever my old man was around, my mother wouldn't even look at me.  Maybe that's when I started to resent him, even hate him.  When he left us... Mom just lost her energy." ... / '''Tidus:''' "The old lady next door told me... when a lovebird dies, the one left behind... It just gives up living so it can join its mate.  It was just like that.  I hated my old man even more."<span style="font-size: 90%;">(''Final Fantasy X'')</span></ref>

During the tournament, Zanarkand is attacked by an immense creature shrouded in water.  The city is destroyed in its path, and Tidus manages to escape a similar fate before the blitzball stadium collapses.  While the destruction goes on, Tidus spots [[Auron]], an old friend of Jecht and mentor to Tidus.  Auron claims he has been waiting for Tidus, and reveals that the creature is called "Sin."  Auron and Tidus fight their way towards Sin, much to Tidus' confusion.  Once there, Auron drags Tidus into the depths of Sin, claiming his story begins here.

Tidus awakens to find himself in the world of Spira, where he quickly runs into the eccentric salvager race, the [[Al Bhed]], and learns from a young Al Bhed girl named "[[Rikku]]" that [[millennium|1000 years]] have passed since the destruction of Zanarkand. After another attack by Sin <U+2014> who Rikku says has been a plague on humanity ever since Zanarkand fell <U+2014> Tidus arrives at [[Locations in Spira#Besaid Island|Besaid Island]].  It is here that he meets [[Yuna]] - a summoner who plans to embark on a pilgrimage to bring about the destruction of Sin.  Along with her guardians [[Lulu (Final Fantasy X)|Lulu]], [[Wakka]] and [[Kimahri Ronso|Kimahri]], Tidus navigates his way throughout Spira in the hope of finding his way home.  Along the way, Tidus reunites with Auron, and even Rikku also joins the party as a guardian.

Throughout the game, Tidus slowly matures, changing from a somewhat naive and self-centered youth into a selfless hero.  This transformation is also hinted <U+2014> through several flashback sequences <U+2014> to have occurred in Jecht himself, who Auron reveals to have taken part in a similar journey ten years earlier.  Auron further reveals to Tidus that Yuna's father, Lord [[List of Final Fantasy X characters#Minor characters|Braska]], Jecht and himself achieved with that journey the very goal that Yuna was currently seeking in her mission.<ref name="sin">'''Tidus:''' "Hey man, there's no way.  That's just impossible." / '''Auron:''' "Nothing impossible about it.  Jecht, Braska, and I... Together we defeated Sin, ten years ago."<span style="font-size: 90%;">(''Final Fantasy X'')</span></ref>  However, Sin returns every time it is destroyed, and Auron reveals <U+2014> much to Tidus' horror and confusion <U+2014> that Jecht himself has returned as Sin.<ref name="sin2">'''Yuna:''' "Sin dies and is reborn." / '''Tidus:''' "I get it! I thought it was weird.  Yuna's dad defeated Sin ten years ago, right? But Sin's still here! Didn't make much sense till now."<span style="font-size: 90%;">(''Final Fantasy X'')</span></ref><ref name="sin3">'''Tidus:''' "Is he alive?" / '''Auron:''' "It depends on what you mean by 'alive'.  He is no longer human.  But then... I felt something of Jecht there in that shell, couldn't you? You must have felt him when you came in contact with Sin." / '''Tidus:''' "It can't be..." / '''Auron:''' "It is.  Sin is Jecht."<span style="font-size: 90%;">(''Final Fantasy X'')</span></ref>

As the game progresses, Tidus learns more about Spira and the concept of the summoner's pilgrimage, but the answers to some of his questions <U+2014> particularly why his father has become Sin, why Sin returns each time it is destroyed and why Zanarkand was supposedly destroyed 1,000 years in the past when Tidus remembered it being attacked only a short time before <U+2014> elude him for some time.  He also begins falling in love with Yuna <U+2014> despite a warning from Lulu that he should not allow himself to<ref name="lulu">'''Lulu:''' "I shouldn't have to say this, but don't fall in love with her."<span style="font-size: 90%;">(''Final Fantasy X'')</span></ref> <U+2014> and shifts more toward Yuna's way of thinking (that the sacrifice of oneself is worth the happiness that destroying Sin would bring to people).  Tidus also begins relinquishing the hatred he long held for his father, and, in time, learns the answers to all of his questions, much to his dismay.

[[Image:Tidus art.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Tidus in ''Final Fantasy X'']]

As the party approaches Zanarkand, another disquieting fact is revealed: neither Tidus nor Jecht are actually ordinary human beings.  They, and the Zanarkand they hail from, are dreams of the [[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Aeons and fayth|fayth]], the same as the aeons.<ref name="dream">'''Tidus:''' "Wait... this is a dream." / '''Fayth:''' "Precisely." / '''Tidus:''' "A dream? Are you crazy? I don't have time to be dreaming now!" / '''Fayth:''' "You're wrong.  It's not that you're dreaming.  You are a dream."<span style="font-size: 90%;">(''Final Fantasy X'')</span></ref> Their city, Dream Zanarkand, was created 1,000 years earlier at the same time as the destruction of the original Zanarkand, when Sin was created in the war between Zanarkand and [[Locations in Spira#Bevelle|Bevelle]]. 

The fayth of the aeon [[Bahamut (Final Fantasy)|Bahamut]] reveals to Tidus that they would like him to find a means to permanently defeat Sin, so that they can all finally rest.  However, the fayth also reveals to him that if he does that, the summoning of Dream Zanarkand and all its people <U+2014> including Tidus himself <U+2014> will disappear.<ref name="rest">'''Fayth:''' "Yes, you're a dream of the fayth.  You, your father, your mother, everyone.  All dreams.  And if the fayth stop dreaming..." / '''Tidus:''' "No! So what if I'm a dream! I... I like being here." / '''Fayth:''' "We've been dreaming so long... we're tired.  Would you and your father... Would you let us rest?"<span style="font-size: 90%;">(''Final Fantasy X'')</span></ref> Soon afterwards, Yuna refuses to undergo the rite of the Final Aeon, and the party fights and defeats Lady [[List of Final Fantasy X characters#Yunalesca|Yunalesca]].  Without Yunalesca, the Final Aeon can never again be attained, leaving Yuna and her companions with only the option of truly finding an alternative method of vanquishing Sin, one that will not allow the creature to return.

To achieve this, they attack Sin directly and enter its shell.  Eventually, they find Jecht and Tidus is reunited with his estranged father, who transforms into his Final Aeon form and is defeated by the party.  After Yuna summons her Aeons to weaken Yu Yevon, Tidus reveals the truth about his existence and that he will disappear after Yu Yevon's defeat.  In spite of this, the party engages Yu Yevon in a final battle and destroys him, ridding the world of Sin permanently, as well as allowing the fayth to depart and the summoning of Dream Zanarkand to end.  Tidus himself then begins to vanish, and after bidding farewell to Yuna, he dives off the airship Fahrenheit into the clouds below, reuniting with the spirits of Auron, Jecht, and Braska in the [[Locations in Spira#Farplane|Farplane]].

===Final Fantasy X-2===
Tidus figures prominently into the plot of ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'', though his appearances in the sequel are few.  Also, because players have the option of renaming Tidus in ''Final Fantasy X'', he is exclusively referred to with pronouns ("he" and "him"), and Rikku calls him "you-know-who" in ''Final Fantasy X-2''.  Two years after the events of ''Final Fantasy X'' end, Rikku shows Yuna a [[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Spheres|sphere]] found by Kimahri on Mt. Gagazet displaying a young man who looks like Tidus trapped in a prison.  This compels Yuna to join the [[List of Final Fantasy X-2 characters#Gullwings|Gullwings]], a sphere-hunting group, and travel around Spira in the hopes of finding more clues that Tidus may be alive.

[[Image:Yuna2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Tidus and Yuna in ''Final Fantasy X-2'']]

The individual seen in the sphere is eventually revealed to be [[List of Final Fantasy X-2 characters#Other characters|Shuyin]] instead, but if certain conditions are met during play of ''Final Fantasy X-2'', the player will be rewarded with an extra scene that features Tidus being revived by the fayth in gratitude of Yuna saving the world a second time.  He is then reunited with her and allowed to live out a natural lifespan, so long as the Fayth can maintain it.

*A younger version of Tidus appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' along with younger versions of [[Wakka]] and ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Selphie Tilmitt]].  This Tidus (voiced by [[Shaun Fleming]]) is an energetic boy who is confident in his athletic ability and enjoys sparring with main characters [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] and [[Riku (Kingdom Hearts)|Riku]].  In the sequel ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', he does not actually appear within the storyline, but is briefly mentioned, by Selphie who say Tidus and Wakka are "all wrapped up in their ball game" it can be assumed (though it is not stated) that the game is blitzball. 
*Along with Auron and Yuna, Tidus appears in ''[[Itadaki Street Special]]''.
