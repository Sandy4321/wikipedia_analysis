The '''Schweizer SGS 1-29''' is a [[United States]] single-seat, mid-wing, experimental [[laminar flow]] [[airfoil]] [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]] built by [[Schweizer Aircraft]] of [[Elmira, New York]].<ref name="SoaringNov83">Said, Bob: ''1983 Sailplane Directory, Soaring Magazine'', page 32. Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920</ref>

The 1-29 is a development of the [[Schweizer SGS 1-23]] that utilizes a 1-23 fuselage and a newly constructed set of 49.2 foot (15.0 m) span wings.<ref name="ActivateMedia"/><ref name="SoaringNov83"/>

The aircraft was constructed to study the feasibility of producing improved boundary layer laminar flow on a metal-winged sailplane. Only one SGS 1-29 was produced and the project was not pursued further.<ref name="ActivateMedia"/><ref name="Schweizer"/><ref name="SoaringNov83"/>

==Background==
In the mid-1950s the SGS 1-23 was in full production and through successive models was performing very well in competition. By 1957 the development of [[fiberglass|fiberglass-reinforced plastic]]  had an impact on the production of many sporting goods, such as boats and fishing rods. Schweizer Aircraft thought it was only a matter of time before a fiberglass sailplane was produced. This concern was borne out in 1965, when two German fiberglass sailplanes were entered in the world championships.<ref name="Schweizer"/>

Schweizer Aircraft evaluated the use of fiberglass for sailplane construction and rejected it for several reasons:<ref name="Schweizer"/>

*The high cost of demonstrating to the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] that this new material could safely be used for aircraft primary structure.<ref name="Schweizer"/>
*Problems with crash resistance of fiberglass structures in high impact accidents.<ref name="Schweizer"/>
*The unknown service life of fiberglass.<ref name="Schweizer"/>
*The high degree of manual labor required to do fiberglass lay-ups at that time and the associated cost.<ref name="Schweizer"/>

The company decided to concentrate on getting the best performance from the material that it knew best, [[aluminum]].<ref name="Schweizer"/>

Schweizer created several design studies of new sailplanes in the mid-1950s. These included:<ref name="Schweizer"/><ref name="Smithsonian"> {{cite web|url = http://siris-thesauri.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=L21C5106397I7.28&profile=planes&uri=link=3100020~!50526~!3100001~!3100002&aspect=subtab13&menu=search&ri=4&source=~!sithesauri&term=Schweizer+7+28&index=|title = Directory of Airplanes|accessdate = 2008-05-13|last = Smithsonian Institution|authorlink = |year = 2004}}</ref>

*'''Schweizer 2-27'''<ref name="Smithsonian"/>
*'''Schweizer 7-28'''<ref name="Smithsonian"/>
*'''Schweizer SGS 1-29'''<ref name="Smithsonian"/>

Of these, only the SGS 1-29 proceeded to prototype stage.<ref name="Schweizer"/><ref name="SoaringNov83"/>

==Design and development==
The 1-29 was constructed using a modified [[Schweizer SGS 1-23|SGS 1-23G]] [[fuselage]]. New [[wing]]s were built for the aircraft to determine if better laminar flow could be achieved on a metal wing.<ref name="ActivateMedia"/><ref name="SoaringNov83"/>

The wings were all-metal and of constant [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]]. The [[Rib (aircraft)|wing ribs]] were identical and created from a single master die to ensure uniformity. The wing features a thick, deep [[Spar (aviation)|spar]] to reduce wing flexing and "oil-canning" that might interrupt laminar flow. The wing was assembled using [[flush rivet]]s and has balanced top and bottom dive brakes.<ref name="ActivateMedia"/><ref name="SoaringNov83"/>

The aircraft first flew in 1958 and flight testing was reported by Schweizer Aircraft as on-going though 1959.<ref name="Schweizer"/>

The 1-29 program did yield positive results. The standard production model [[Schweizer SGS 1-23|SGS 1-23H-15]] with the same fuselage and wingspan as the 1-29 and a NACA 43012A airfoil, produced a best glide ratio of 29:1. With its laminar flow wing and NACA 63-618 airfoil the 1-29 recorded a 34:1 glide ratio, an improvement of 15%.<ref name="SoaringNov83"/>

The 1-29 design was never [[Type certificate|certified]] and the sole aircraft that was built is an [[experimental aircraft]] in the "racing, exhibition" class and registered as N3898A.<ref name="SoaringNov83"/><ref name="FAA"> {{cite web|url = http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNumSQL.asp?verified=1&NNumbertxt=3898A|title = FAA Registry|accessdate = 2008-05-27|last = [[Federal Aviation Administration]]|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = May}}</ref>

==Operational history==
The 1-29 was flown in at least three US national competitions by [[Schweizer brothers|Paul A Schweizer]], Bill Ivans and Tom Smith.<ref name="SoaringNov83"/>

==Aircraft on display==
Once the 1-29 test program was complete, the aircraft was donated to the [[National Soaring Museum]] where it is currently listed as being in storage.<ref name="NSM"> {{cite web|url = http://www.soaringmuseum.org/collection.html|title = Sailplanes in Our Collection|accessdate = 2008-04-15|last = Munson|first = J.|authorlink = |year = undated}}</ref>
