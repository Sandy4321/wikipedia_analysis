'''Interstate&nbsp;781''' (I-781) is a future [[auxiliary Interstate Highway]] that will be constructed north of [[Watertown (city), New York|Watertown]] in [[Jefferson County, New York]], [[United States]]. When complete, the route will extend for {{convert|4.9|mi|km}} from [[Interstate 81 (New York)|Interstate&nbsp;81]] in [[Pamelia, New York|Pamelia]] to the main entrance of [[Fort Drum, New York|Fort Drum]] in [[Le Ray, New York|Le Ray]]. It will also have one intermediate interchange with [[U.S. Route 11 (New York)|U.S. Route&nbsp;11]] just west of Fort Drum. I-781 will be four lanes wide and is expected to serve as the principal travel corridor into and out of the fort.

The original designation for I-781 was '''New York State Route&nbsp;781'''. On April&nbsp;13, 2009, the [[Federal Highway Administration]] designated NY&nbsp;781 as a future Interstate Highway corridor and as "Future I-781". The I-781 designation will not officially take effect until the highway is complete.

==Route description==
<!--this is about as specific as a description can be until the highway actually opens-->
Interstate&nbsp;781 will begin at a new interchange with [[Interstate 81 (New York)|Interstate&nbsp;81]] located {{convert|0.7|mi|km}} of exit&nbsp;48 ([[New York State Route 342|NY&nbsp;342]]) in the town of [[Pamelia, New York|Pamelia]]. It will proceed to the east, roughly paralleling NY&nbsp;342 as it heads toward [[Fort Drum, New York|Fort Drum]]. I-781 will have one intermediate interchange with [[U.S. Route 11 (New York)|U.S. Route&nbsp;11]] just west of Fort Drum before it terminates at Fort Drum's main gate. The highway will be four lanes wide, with two lanes for each direction.<ref name="aashto" />

==History==
By 2003, the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT) had begun to evaluate potential ways to improve [[Fort Drum, New York|Fort Drum]]'s access to [[Interstate 81 (New York)|Interstate&nbsp;81]]. Three alternatives were considered: the construction a new highway that would run north of [[New York State Route 342|NY&nbsp;342]] and directly connect I-81 to the main gate of Fort Drum; the construction of a new route to the south of NY&nbsp;342 that would link I-81 to [[U.S. Route 11 (New York)|U.S. Route&nbsp;11]] southwest of the fort's main gate; and improving the existing NY&nbsp;342.<ref name="aashto" /> In November 2005, NYSDOT officials announced that the southern route had been chosen and that it would cost $64 million to construct. Two months later, NYSDOT announced that they now favored the northern alignment after receiving input from area residents and the [[United States Army]]. According to NYSDOT Commissioner Thomas Madison, the new alignment would have less of an impact on future development on Fort Drum and cost $7 million less to construct.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://capitalnews9.com/capital-region-news-12-content/headlines/?ArID=16307&SecID=33 |title=Fort Drum connector plans change |date=January 26, 2006 |work=[[Capital News 9]] |accessdate=October 11, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Nicolas Zimmerman |title=New York Transportation Department switches to north route |date=January 25, 2006 |work=[[Watertown Daily Times]]}}</ref>

The proposed highway was initially designated as NY&nbsp;781 by NYSDOT.<ref>{{cite book |title=Official Description of Highway Touring Routes, Bicycling Touring Routes, Scenic Byways, & Commemorative/Memorial Designations in New York State |author=[[New York State Department of Transportation]] |month=October |year=2007}}</ref> On February&nbsp;11, 2008, NYSDOT submitted an application to the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] requesting that NY&nbsp;781 be designated as Interstate&nbsp;781. The [[Federal Highway Administration]] designated NY&nbsp;781 as a future Interstate Highway corridor on April&nbsp;13, 2009; however, the I-781 designation was not officially assigned at this time as per [[United States Code]] an Interstate Highway designation can only be assigned to a completed highway built to [[Interstate Highway standards]]. As a result, FHWA stipulated that the highway can only be referred to as "Future I-781" until the I-781 designation is officially assigned.<ref name="aashto" />

The contract for the Fort Drum Connector (I-781) project is scheduled to be awarded in April 2010; however, it may be let as early as December 2009 if enough funds are allocated for the project by that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nysdot.gov/regional-offices/region7/projects/fort-drum-connector/construction |title=Fort Drum Connector Project <U+2013> Construction Information |author=[[New York State Department of Transportation]] |accessdate=October 11, 2009}}</ref> Construction is expected to begin in early 2010,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nysdot.gov/regional-offices/region7/projects/fort-drum-connector |title=Fort Drum Connector Project |author=[[New York State Department of Transportation]] |accessdate=October 11, 2009}}</ref> and total completion of the $106 million project is slated for the end of 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wktv.com/news/local/44263022.html |title=$106 million NY highway project acts to help bats |date=May 3, 2009 |work=[[WKTV]] |accessdate=October 11, 2009}}</ref> I-781 itself is expected to be completed by late 2010.<ref name="aashto" />
