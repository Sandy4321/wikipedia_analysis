'''al-K<U+0101>hinat''' ([[Classical Arabic]] for "female seer"; modern [[Maghreb Arabic]] '''l-Kahna''', commonly romanised as '''Kah(i)na''', also known as '''Dihya''' or '''Kahya''') was a [[7th century]] female [[Amazigh]] religious and military leader, who led indigenous resistance to the [[Arabization]] of the [[Northwest Africa]]n region known as the [[Maghreb]], she was born in the early [[7th century]] and died in the [[690s]] in modern day [[Algeria]].

==Kahina's Disputed Origins==
Her real name was '''Dihy<U+0101>''', '''Dahy<U+0101>''' or '''Damiya''' (the Arabic spellings are difficult to distinguish between these variants); '''al-K<U+0101>hinat''' was the nickname used by her Arab opponents because of her reputed ability to foresee the future. According to legend, l-Kahna was the daughter of [[Tabat]], or some say [[M<U+0101>tiya]]<ref>according to some, this name is an arabicized form of the Christian name Matthias or Matthew, see cited paper by Talbi for more discussion</ref>, a chieftain of the [[Jarawa (Berber)|Jr<U+0101>wa]] tribe from the [[Aur<U+00E8>s Mountains]]. Other accounts indicate she was a Jew or that her tribe were [[Judaized]] Berbers, though scholars dispute this<ref>Talbi (see citation below) points out that she was said to have been accompanied in her travels by what the Arabs called an "idol", possibly an icon of the Virgin or one of the Christian saints, but certainly not something associated with either Jewish or pagan Berber religious customs. The idea that the Jr<U+0101>wa were [[Judaized]] comes from the medieval historian [[Ibn Khaldun]], who named them among a number of such tribes. Talbi notes that [[Ibn Khaldun]] seems to have been referring to a time before the advent of the late [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine]] empires, and a little later in the same paragraph seems to say that by l-Kahna's time "the tribes" (presumably those he had listed before) had become Christianized.</ref>.

[[Ibn Khaldun]] records many legends about l-Kahna. A number of them refer to her long hair or great size, both legendary characteristics of sorcerers. She is also supposed to have had the gift of [[prophecy]] and she had three sons, which is characteristic of witches in legends. Even the fact that two were her own and one was adopted (an Arab officer she had captured), was an alleged trait of sorcerers in tales. Another legend claims that in her youth, she had supposedly freed her people from a tyrant by agreeing to marry him and then murdering him on their wedding night. Virtually nothing else of her personal life is known.

==Kahina's Legendary Life==
L-Kahna succeeded [[Kusaila]] as the war leader of the [[Berber]] tribes in the [[680s]] and opposed the encroaching Arab armies of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Dynasty]]. [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]] marched from [[Egypt]] and captured the major [[Byzantine]] city of [[Carthage]] and other cities (see [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa]] ). Searching for another enemy to defeat, he was told that the most powerful monarch in North Africa was l-Kahna, and accordingly marched towards the [[Aur<U+00E8>s Mountains|Aur<U+00E8>s]]. The armies met near [[Meskiana]] in the present-day province of [[Oum el-Bouaghi Province|Oum el-Bouaghi]], [[Algeria]]. She defeated [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man|Hasan]] so soundly that he fled [[Ifriqiya]] and holed up in [[Cyrenaica]] (Libya) for four or five years. Realizing that the enemy was too powerful and bound to return, she embarked on a [[scorched earth]] campaign, which had little impact on the mountain and desert tribes, but lost her the crucial support of the sedentary oasis-dwellers. Instead of discouraging the Arab armies, her desperate decision hastened defeat.

[[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man|Hasan]] eventually returned and, aided by communications with the captured officer adopted by l-Kahna, defeated her at a locality (presumably in present-day Algeria) about which there is some uncertainty<ref>Talbi suggests it was between Setif and Tobna</ref>. Before the battle, foreseeing the outcome, she sent her two real sons over to the Arab army under the care of the adopted son, and [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man|Hasan]] is said to have given one of them charge of a section of his forces. According to some accounts, l-Kahna died fighting the invaders, sword in hand, a warrior's death. Other accounts say she committed suicide by swallowing poison rather than be taken by the enemy. This final act occurred in the [[690s]], with [[693]] (some say [[697]]) given as the most likely year. In that year, she was, according to ancient accounts quoted by [[Ibn Khaldun]], 127 years old, which would place the year of her birth in the [[6th century]], c. [[566]]. This was probably not meant literally, as great age was often depicted with exaggerated numbers.

In later centuries, Kahina's legend was used to bolster the claims of Berbers in [[Al-Andalus|al-Andal<U+016B>s]] against Arab claims of ethnic supremacy&mdash;in the early modern age, she was used by Europeans, Berbers, and Arabs alike for their own didactic purposes.
