== Works ==
Cormier became a full-time writer after the success of his first novel for teenagers, ''[[The Chocolate War]]'', followed by others such as ''[[I Am the Cheese]]'' and ''[[After the First Death]]''. He was concerned with the problems facing young people in modern society, and this concern was reflected in his novels.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite web |url= http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,6109,393333,00.html|title= Robert Cormier {{!}} News {{!}} Guardian Unlimited Books |accessdate=2008-01-28 |format= HTML}}</ref><ref name="enotes">{{cite web |url= http://www.enotes.com/authors/robert-cormier|title= Robert Cormier |accessdate=2008-01-28 |format= HTML}}</ref> He soon established a reputation as a brilliant and uncompromising writer. Included in his awards is the [[Margaret A. Edwards Award]] of the Young Adult Services Division of the [[American Library Association]]. This award is presented in recognition of those authors who provide young adults with a window through which they can view the world, and which will help them to grow and understand themselves and their role in society.<ref name="Worchester"/>

In a few of his books, Cormier's hometown of Leominster became the fictional town of Monument, and French Hill became Frenchtown.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite web |url= http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,6109,393333,00.html|title= Robert Cormier {{!}} News {{!}} Guardian Unlimited Books |accessdate=2008-01-28 |format= HTML}}</ref>
