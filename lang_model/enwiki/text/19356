The '''Wonder World Tour''' is the second [[concert tour]] by American recording artist [[Miley Cyrus]]. The tour was held to promote her second studio album ''[[Breakout (Miley Cyrus album)|Breakout]]'' (2008) and first extended play (EP) ''[[The Time of Our Lives (EP)|The Time of Our Lives]]'' (2009). It began in September 2009 and concluded in December 29, visiting cities in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]]; thus, the Wonder World Tour became Cyrus' first world tour. It also became Cyrus' first tour not to incorporate performances as [[Hannah Montana (character)|Hannah Montana]]. Alternative band [[Metro Station (band)|Metro Station]] served as [[opening act]] for all tour venues. It was sponsored by [[Wal-Mart]] and promoted by [[AEG Live]]. All tickets from the Wonder World Tour were sold using paperless ticketing, in order to prevent [[Ticket resale|ticket scalping]] similar to what had occurred during [[Best of Both Worlds Tour|Cyrus' previous tour]]. One dollar from each ticket sold was donated to the [[City of Hope National Medical Center]], an organization devoted to the fight against [[cancer]].

The Wonder World Tour has been described as part of Cyrus' transitional period, with more elaborate and edgier characteristics. Each concert was divided into seven segments, each of which bared different themes, the subject of matter for the tour's title. The show opened with Cyrus performing rock-oriented songs. It also featured her and backup dancers being suspended above the stage with [[aerial rigging]] various times. At one point, she mounted a [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle as it was elevated and made its path across the venue. Cyrus also rendered a tribute to the deceased singer [[Michael Jackson]] and performed two Hannah Montana-credited songs as herself.

The tour received positive to mixed reception from critics. Some praised it and deemed it a spectacle, while others believed it lacked profundity and portrayal of Cyrus' personality. The Wonder World Tour was commercially successful despite the [[Financial crisis (2007<U+2013>present)|financial recession]] that was present in 2009. It was able to sell-out all European dates in ten minutes and marks the largest attendance at [[The O2 arena (London)|The O<sub>2</sub> Arena]] in [[London, England]]. During the first leg of the tour, one bus overturned several times on a highway. The accident resulted in the injury of one person and the death of another. The cause of the accident is yet to be specified, yet multiple theories for it exist. A filtered version of the Wonder World Tour was broadcast on the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) on June 18, 2010 and received a total of over 2.6 million viewers. The full-length concert film was released on the limited, deluxe edition of Cyrus' third studio album ''[[Can't Be Tamed]]'' (2010).

Cyrus is a singer-songwriter and actress who starred on the [[Disney Channel]] television series ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' as [[Miley Stewart]], a girl with a secret [[double life]] as the popstar [[Hannah Montana (character)|Hannah Montana]].

All tickets for the Wonder World Tour were sold exclusively through paperless ticket delivery, meaning that fans did not receive a physical concert ticket for their entry into the event. Ticket buyers were required to bring the credit card used to make the purchase and photo identification to the concert venue in order to gain entry. All groups were to enter the concert together, and ushers issued seat locator slips.<ref name="walmart" /> The method of ticket sales was relatively new at the time, although [[Ticketmaster]] first experimented it with [[AC/DC]]'s [[Black Ice World Tour]] (2008<U+2013>10). However, it marked the first time for an arena tour to sell all tickets through paperless ticketing.<ref name="yahootickets">{{cite web|title=Miley Cyrus Fights Scalpers with Paperless Tickets|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/miley-cyrus/news/miley-cyrus-fights-scalpers-with-paperless-tickets--61720659|work=[[Yahoo!

Also, more resources were available, for more companies were willing to invest in the tour. Ideas were suggested by different individuals and were tested during filmed rehearsals in order to decide which would make the final cut. "Each person has their own character and their own story. So, we've added everyone's kind of specialty into our show [...] This is not just a concert, it is an absolute show", Cyrus said.<ref name="ah">{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/inside-miley-cyrus-tour-september-9-2009_video_1155801|date=September 9, 2009|accessdate=October 3, 2009|work=[[Access Hollywood]]|publisher=[[CBS Television Distribution]]|title=Inside Miley Cyrus<U+2019> Tour (September 9, 2009)}}</ref> After having completed filming for ''[[The Last Song (film)|The Last Song]]'' (2010) in [[Tybee Island, Georgia]], Cyrus returned to [[Los Angeles, California]] for tour rehearsals at [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]] in mid-August.<ref name="onair">{{cite web|url=http://a1135.g.akamai.net/f/1135/18227/1h/cchannel.download.akamai.com/18227/podcast/LOSANGELES-CA/KIIS-FM/mileycyrus071609.mp3?CPROG=PCAST&MARKET=LOSANGELES-CA&NG_FORMAT=chrrhythmic&SITE_ID=842&STATION_ID=KIIS-FM&PCAST_AUTHOR=102.7_KIIS-FM&PCAST_CAT=morning_shows&PCAST_TITLE=On-Air_with_Ryan_Seacrest|title=On Air with Ryan Seacrest|work=[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest (radio)|On Air with Ryan Seacrest]]|publisher=[[Premiere Radio Networks]]|accessdate=August 4, 2009}}</ref> Due to filming ''The Last Song'', Cyrus was only able to rehearse for three weeks although the average rehearsal period for musicians is about three months.<ref name="onair" />

Jammal Simms was hired as the tour's director and main [[choreographer]]. Octavious Terry served as an assistant for directing, meanwhile Dondraico Johnson assisted choreography. They, along with twelve other members, composed the tour's creative team.<ref name="mobileproduction">{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=Michael A.|date=January 2010|title=Miley Cyrus: Queen of Gags|journal=Mobile Production Monthly|publisher=Tour Guide Publications|volume=3|issue=1|page=36|url=http://mobileproductionpro.com/publications/mpm_issues/mobile_production_monthly_v3_i1.pdf|accessdate=January 30, 2011}}</ref> In total, the Wonder World Tour included 124 traveling workers, 19 truckloads of equipment, and 15 buses.<ref name="americanexpress" /> The stage was quite different from that of the Best of Both Worlds Tour. It consisted of a rectangular [[main stage]], which featured staircases that elevated the center of the stage, and a narrow [[runway]], which connected the main stage to a [[B-stage]] that ran the length of the main stage.<ref name="mobileproduction" /> Regarding the stage, Cyrus noted that it was "something not many people get to have. I'm able to move around to each side so there's no one person who feels like they don't have the best seat. Every seat is the best seat."<ref name="americanexpress" /> Six [[LED]] multi-screen video units were located throughout the stage; the three largest were placed as the upstage wall, while the other three were hung by [[rig (stage lighting)|rig]]s above the stage. The center unit consisted of three screens that faced outward; two others were hung right and left to the center unit, both were double faced toward the center of the venue at a 45<U+00B0> angle, while the backside faced the upper-seat audience. The structure of the video panels was designed by Sims to ensure that all seats within the 270<U+00B0> angle at each venue received an equal view of the video screens.<ref name="mobileproduction" /> [[video designer|Video]] content and [[Lighting designer|lighting]] were designed by Se<U+00E1>n Burke; the latter was provided by Production Resource Group (PRG).<ref name="mobileproduction" />

The tour used seven individual [[Aerial rigging|rigs for performers and props]] to become airborne. For dancers to be flown to the center of each upstage, a wench, which dropped 18&nbsp;inches off the face of the panel, was placed in the rig. Cyrus' flying required two wenches, one for a vertical lift and one for a horizontal move that coursed the audience and back to the stage.<ref name="mobileproduction" /> Four elevators, or [[trap door]]s, were located throughout the stage, some of which had the option of a 4<U+00D7>4 or an 8<U+00D7>8 foot opening. All of the fly rigs and elevators were built and operated by Show Group Production Services (SGPS)/Showrig.<ref name="mobileproduction" /> The challenge that presented the most difficulty for SGPS was time constraint, as there were only three weeks of rehearsal. Brian White, co-owner of SGPS, explained,
{{quote|There wasn<U+2019>t a lot of time, but the good news was that it was at the [L.A.] Forum, which gave us a lot of height to fly things around, and there was also a lot of room to lay stuff out on the floor. The other good thing was that our offices are only 10 minutes away. So if I had to send a welder down there to make some changes I could do it pretty fast. The biggest thing we had going for us was a great crew. We had some really good people out there." [...] I<U+2019>d say that about 90 percent of what we built on Miley Cyrus fit the first time in rehearsal. The only reason we had to retro fit anything was because of last minute design changes that came about once everything was up and they could see it all.<ref name="mobileproduction" />}}

[[File:Bottom of the Ocean Wonder World Performance-edit.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Cyrus performing "Bottom of the Ocean" on the concert tour]]
[[Special effect]]s and [[pyrotechnics]] were provided by Pyritz Pyrotechnics Group. Terry Ritz, founder of the organization, and his partner Steve Aleff had created various ideas based on the tour soundtrack that was provided to them by the Wonder World Tour's personnel. They met with the tour's choreographer, band manager, and lighting designer, asking them to bring their "hopes, wishes, and dreams."<ref name="mobileproduction" /> Out of these meetings, the show was completed and a lighting crew, who monitored the stage with a four-camera monitor system when cues were executed, was selected.<ref name="mobileproduction" /> The pyrotechnics for the show were described as more elegant and subtle, being composed of pink flames with accentuation of silver and white glitter.<ref name="mobileproduction" /> Because of the extensive automation executed throughout the concert, two personnel were in charge of running it. Neville Emerton ran the automation from under the stage, and Sean Conner ran all of the flying moves from a position at the front of each venue. Meanwhile, assistant [[stage manager]] Seth Posner called cues for each concert. "Normally, in a rock show you don<U+2019>t need someone calling the show. In this one we had to take a more theatrical approach with someone calling cues every step of the way because there was so much going on at once between props and automation", explained [[production manager]] Omar Abderrahman.<ref name="mobileproduction" /> One of the props that required much attention on the part of Posner was a car made to resemble a tractor, designed and built by effects designer and stage manager Scott "Stryker" Christensen. Because it came along late in the design process, the main elevator was not built to handle the weight of the car, though it was eventually reinforced to support the weight and movement of the car. The car was also modified; it was made electric, instead of using a combustion engine, for fire-safety and changed to turn around by adjusting its turning radius to automate steering with all four wheels.<ref name="mobileproduction" /> In order to translate the concert tour overseas to the United Kingdom, the Wonder World Tour paired with Sound Moves, a company that was already providing minor support for the North American leg of the tour.<ref name="mobileproduction" />

The main show commenced with Cyrus emerging from the bottom of the stage inside a large, crystal-like [[glacier]].

==Critical reception==
[[File:Wonder World - Miley Cyrus.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Cyrus performing "Spotlight" on the Wonder World Tour]]
Mikael Wood of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', in reference to Hannah Montana, commented, "Once again, make-believe Miley was more compelling than the real thing." Wood believed Cyrus possessed charisma, commenting that she portrayed superstar authority, but failed because she was unable or unwilling to "give her fans a deeper idea of who she is and what her music means.

Jim Harrington of ''[[The Oakland Tribune]]'' described the show as a human embodiment of [[Britney Spears]]' "[[I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman]]" (2002).

On November 20, 2009, in its attempt to arrive at the destination of [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], one of the buses for the Wonder World Tour overturned on a [[Virginia]]n highway.  The accident occurred around 8:15 A.M. in [[Dinwiddie County]], about 40 miles south of [[Richmond, Virginia]]. The bus ran off the left side of [[Interstate 85]], struck an embankment, rolled onto its right side. An eye witness of the accident explained that the bus appeared to have drifted off the road for a fairly long stretch before tipping over.<ref name="cbs">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/20/entertainment/main5723016.shtml|title=Miley Cyrus Tour Bus Crash Kills 1|date=November 20, 2009|work=[[CBS News]]|publisher=[[CBS Broadcasting Inc]]|accessdate=February 3, 2011}}</ref> The bus had nine passengers aboard,<ref name="cbs" /> including members of the lighting crew, though Cyrus was not on board during the incident.

One person, Assistant Stage Manager Martin Zilio, required medical attention and was hospitalized overnight.<ref name="cbs" /> Zilio recovered from his injuries and was later able to return to work on the tour.<ref name="mobileproduction" /> One person, bus driver Bill "Uncle Bill" Douglas, a 53-year-old of [[Austin, Texas]], died at the scene of the accident.<ref name="cbs" />

In response to the accident, the Cyrus family released a statement via Cyrus' official website; it stated, "We are deeply saddened by the loss of Bill 'Uncle Bill' Douglas. Members of our tour are like members of our family. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family in the midst of this tragedy.
