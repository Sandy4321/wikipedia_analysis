'''''The Story of a Soul''''' (''l'Histoire d'une <U+00C2>me'') is the autobiography of [[Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se of Lisieux]], a French [[Discalced Carmelite]] nun, later recognized as a saint. It was first published on September 30, 1898, a year to the day after her death from [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 24, on September 30, 1897. The book was a single volume formed from three distinct manuscripts - manuscripts of different length, written at different times, addressed to different people, and differing from one another in character. The work of unifying these disparate manuscripts was carried out by Pauline, the sister of Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se. It was initially published  with a limited audience in mind, the Carmelite convents and certain religious personalities, and just 2000 copies of the 475 page book were printed.<ref>Therese and Lisieux, Pierre Descouvement  and Helmuth Nils Loose ISBN 1-85390-381-7</ref> It quickly became a publishing phenomenon however and  Sister Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se of the Child Jesus was canonised in 1925.

'''Manuscript A''', entitled ''The Story of a Little White Flower'', and dedicated to her sister Pauline, was written between the beginning of January 1895, and the 20 January 1896. Pauline has described how, as she sat with her sisters on a winter evening in the one room of Carmel where there was a fire, the writing of the first manuscript was decided. " One evening in the beginning of the year 1895, I was with my two sisters Marie and Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se. Sister Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se of the Child Jesus told me several happenings of her childhood and Sister Marie of the Sacred Heart (my eldest sister Marie) said to me; 'O Mother, what a pity that all this should not be written down for us. If you were to ask Sister Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se to write down her childhood memories, how much pleasure this would give us!'..I turned to Sister Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se, who laughed as though we were teasing her, and said: 'I order you to write down your memories of your childhood.'

It was there I remember while we were walking on the beach, and I was scampering about near Papa, that a lady and gentleman came up to ask if that pretty little girl was his daughter. I noticed that Papa, as he said yes, made a sign to show that he didn't want them to pay me compliments. It was the first time I'd heard myself called pretty, and I enjoyed it, because I didn't think I was pretty at all. You'd been so careful, dear Mother to keep me away from anything of that sort.."

'''Manuscript B'''  is a letter to Sister Marie of the Sacred Heart (the eldest sister of Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se), and written at her request in three days between  the 13 and 16 September 1896. Marie asked Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se to write down her spiritual discoveries, what Marie described as ''her little way of trust and love''.<ref>''Actes officiels du Proc<U+00E8>s depos<U+00E9>s dans les Archives de l'<U+00C9>v<U+00EA>ch<U+00E9> de Bayeux'' volume one - depositions made by 37 witnesses about the life of Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se to an ecclesiastic tribunal instituted by Bishop Lemonnier of Bayeux in 1910</ref> Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se replied in ten closely written pages. "Her many corrections show that she wrote in great haste and in a state of extreme fatigue." <ref>Fr. Francoise de Sainte Marie, O.C.D, in Introduction , Autobiography of a Saint p.13, tr: Ronald Knox, ISBN 0-00-623577-8</ref>


'''Manuscript C''' is a notebook written for the prioress of the Carmel Reverend Mother Marie de Gonzague. It was begun on 3 June 1897 and finished early in July, 1897.
The origin of the third part of the autobiography of Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se has been described by Pauline: "It seemed to me that these accounts were incomplete. Sister Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se of the Child Jesus had concentrated on her childhood and early youth as I had asked her to do, her life as a nun was hardly sketched in.&nbsp;... I thought it a great pity that she had not described the development of her life in the Carmel in the same way, but just then I had ceased to be Reverend Mother and Mother Marie de Gonzague held this office&nbsp;... seeing that Sister Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se was so ill..about midnight on the evening of the 2 June 1897&nbsp;... I went to see Mother Prioress." <ref>Quoted from Bayeux depositions, Introduction, ''Autobiography of a Saint'' p.13</ref> Pauline asked the Prioress to order Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se to write about her life as a religious and the next morning Marie de Gonzague did so, so that Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se went on with her account. Most of this manuscript was written during the month of June, 1897. Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se stopped writing in the first days of July, 1897. " Eventually the pencil fell from her hand as she wrote the last word, ''love''. It is the final word of all three manuscripts." <ref>Introduction ''Autobiography of a Saint'', p14</ref>

Pauline divided Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se's three manuscripts into eleven chapters  and added a twelfth in which she summarized the last months of her life. Finally, she supplemented the work with some of Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se's poetry and with extracts from her correspondence. The twelve chapters of ''The Story of a Soul'' were printed in small format in 1902: An Unpetalled Rose. By 1906, ''The Story of a Soul'' was already translated into six languages (English, Polish, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish).<ref>Therese and Lisieux, p 312, Descouvement, Loose</ref>
