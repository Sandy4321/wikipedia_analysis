==Murchad's death in the ''Annals of the Four Masters''==

''Murchadh, son of Diarmaid, son of Mael-na-mbo, lord of the foreigners and of Leinster, under his father, died at Ath-cliath, precisely on Sunday, the festival of Mary, in winter. It was in lamentation of him the poet composed these quatrains:'' 

:''There is grief for a chief king at [[County Dublin|Ath Cliath]],''
:''Which will not be exceeded till the terrible [[Judgment Day]];''
:''Empty is the fortress without the descendant of [[Duach]],''
:''Quickly was the vigour of its heroes cut down.''
:''Sorrowful every party in the fortress''
:''For their chief, against whom no army prevailed;''
:''Since the body of the king was hidden from all,''
:''Every evil has showered ever constant.''
:''For Murchadh, son of Diarmaid the impetuous,''
:''Many a fervent prayer is offered;''
:''In sorrow for the death of the chief is every host''
:''That was wont to defeat in the battle,''
:''Great the sorrow that he was not everlasting;''
:''Pity that death hath attacked him.''
:''Too early it was that he removed from him his complexion,''
:''That he removed one like him from his body.''
:''Liberal of wealth was the grandson of Mael-na-mbo;''
:''He bestowed horses, and he distributed cows,''
:''For the sake of his going to God.''
:''Who is it to whom 'tis best to give fleeting wealth?''
