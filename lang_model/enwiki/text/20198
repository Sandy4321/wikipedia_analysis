'''Michael Singletary''' (born [[October 9]], [[1958]] in [[Houston, Texas]]) is a former [[linebacker]] in [[American football]] who played his entire career for the [[Chicago Bears]] in the [[National Football League|NFL]], after starring in college at [[Baylor University]], whose team is also known as the Bears.  While with the Bears, Singletary was known as "The Heart of the Defense" for the [[Monsters of the Midway]] in the mid-1980s.  His nickname is '''Samurai Mike'''. Singletary was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1998.

Singletary is currently the linebackers and assistant head coach for the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and was overseeing the progress of college linebackers at the 2007 [[Senior Bowl]].

== College career ==
Singletary was the only college junior to be selected to the All-[[SWC]] Team of the 1970s, Singletary earned All-America honors in both junior and senior years at Baylor, where he averaged 15 tackles per game and established a team record with 232 tackles in [[1978]], including 34 in a game against the University of Houston.  Singletary's senior season of 1980, Baylor won 10 games for the only time in school history.

== Professional career ==
At 6'0, 230 lbs, Singletary became a starter in the Bears lineup in the seventh game of his rookie season ([[1981]]). In a game against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], his third as a starter, Singletary put on a remarkable defensive performance recording 10 tackles and forcing a fumble. A nearly unanimous all-rookie selection, Singletary went on to start 172 games for the Bears during his 12-year career, which is the second most in club history.

An intense player, Mike finished as the Bears' first or second leading tackler each of his last 11 seasons. He amassed an impressive 1,488 career tackles, 885 of which were solo efforts. A constant force on defense, he missed playing just two games, both in [[1986]].  He also recorded 7 interceptions and 12 fumble recoveries.

In a game against the [[Denver Broncos]] in [[1990]] he had a personal-best performance when he recorded 10 solo tackles and 10 assists. Selected to play in a team record 10 [[Pro Bowl]]s, Singletary was All-Pro eight times, and All-NFC every year from [[1983]] to [[1991]].

He earned the nickname "''Samurai Mike''" during his professional career in recognition of the intimidating focus and intensity he displayed on the field.  He was also known as "the Minister of Defense," as he is also an ordained minister.  (For the same reason, the nickname would later be given to [[Reggie White]].)

He led the Bears to a magnificent 15-1 season in 1985. That season, he recorded 109 solo tackles (52 assists), 3 sacks, 1 interception, 3 fumble recoveries, 1 forced fumble, and 10 defended passes. He won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year, and led a defense that was ranked 1st overall (1st against the rush; 3rd against the pass).

Throughout the 1985 playoffs, Singletary provided stellar efforts in all 3 games. In the divisional game against the New York Giants at home, Singletary provided a fumble recovery early in the 1st quarter and a sack of quarterback Phil Simms on 3rd down early in the 3rd quarter. The Bears went on to win 21-0. In the NFC Championship game vs. the Los Angeles Rams, Singletary and the Bears dominated again. Mike Ditka said that the day before the game, he was talking to the offense while Singletary was in the next room giving the defense a motivational speech. While it started out quiet, within minutes, Samurai Mike was screaming at the top of his lungs and the defensive players were throwing chairs and knocking over tables. The next day come game time, the Bears shut down NFL legend [[Eric Dickerson]]. Singletary posted 12 tackles, a batted pass, and a forced fumble in the game. He also provided one of the finest moments of his career and of the Bears' 1985 season in that game. It was 3rd and 1 towards the end of the 1st quarter, and quarterback Dieter Brock handed the ball to Dickerson. Dickerson headed towards a seemingly open hole over the left guard, but as Dickerson approached the hole, Singletary slammed it shut. Dickerson was stood straight up and thrown back for a loss, while the rest of the Bears dog-piled on top. Mike got up and started barking like mad (carrying on the "Junk-Yard Dog" theme the defense held all season), and "Dickerson didn't know where he was at," claimed fellow linebacker Wilber Marshall. The final score was 24-0. 
The Bears would eventually go to win [[Super Bowl XX]] by beating the [[New England Patriots]] 46-10.  In the game, Singletary broke up a pass that would have gone for a touchdown, delivered a jarring hit to New England runningback Craig James, and tied a Super Bowl record with 2 fumble recoveries. 

Singletary was named [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award|NFL Defensive Player of the Year]] by the [[Associated Press]] in 1985 and 1988. He was elected to the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in [[1995 in sports|1995]] and to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in [[1998 in sports|1998]].  In [[1999]], he was ranked number 56 on ''[[The Sporting News]]''' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.

== Coaching career ==

In 2002, per ESPN, a group of Alumni at Baylor University promoted Singletary for the school's open head coaching position, holding a conference call (which included Mike Ditka and Dave McGinnis) with the university administration. The position ultimately went to [[Guy Morriss]]. Singletary at the time had no head or assistant coaching experience and the university president later stated that they wanted to hire a coach with prior <U+201C>head coaching experience.<U+201D>  

In [[2003 NFL season|2003]], Singletary became linebackers coach for the [[Baltimore Ravens]] (pairing Singletary with [[Ray Lewis (NFL)|Ray Lewis]]).  Following the [[2004 NFL season|2004]] season, the [[San Francisco 49ers]] hired Ravens defensive coordinator [[Mike Nolan]] to be their head coach, and Singletary left the Ravens with Nolan to be San Francisco's assistant head coach and linebackers coach.

In [[2007 NFL season|2007]], Singletary interviewed for the head coaching job of the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[San Diego Chargers]], but was ultimately passed over.  He remains a head coaching prospect. With Morriss leaving Baylor after the 2007 season, Singletary appeared to be the leading candidate for his replacement, and expressed interest in the job.<ref>http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/colleges/topstories/stories/111007dnspobaylorlede.283d4e7.html Ex-Baylor star Singletary expresses interest in Baylor job</ref> On [[November 19]], 2007, Baylor athletic director Ian McCaw flew to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] to interview Singletary.<ref>http://www.wacotrib.com/news/content/news/stories/2007/11/19/11192007wacbufbbreak.html?imw=Y Waco Tribune-Herald: Singletary interviews for BU football coaching job</ref> However, Singletary decided against taking the position.<ref>http://www.star-telegram.com/sports/story/316730.html</ref>

==Personal life==
In addition to his coaching duties for the 49ers, Singletary is a motivational speaker and has authored three books; ''Singletary One on One'', ''Calling the Shots'', and ''Daddy<U+2019>s Home at Last''. 

Singletary and his wife, Kim, have seven children. His son Matt has joined Baylor's roster in 2007 as a freshman
defensive end.
