'''''Resident Evil''''', known as {{nihongo|''biohazard''|<U+30D0><U+30A4><U+30AA><U+30CF><U+30B6><U+30FC><U+30C9>|baiohaz<U+0101>do}} in Japan, is an [[Video game remake|enhanced remake]] of the 1996 [[survival horror]] [[video game]] ''[[Resident Evil (video game)|Resident Evil]]'', developed by [[Capcom Production Studio 4]] and published by [[Capcom]] for the [[Nintendo GameCube]] in 2002. The remake includes state of the art visuals as well as a variety of new gameplay elements, environments and story details; [[Shinji Mikami]] has stated that it is "70% different from the original."<ref name="GSpot_NGC">{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/action/residentevil/review.html | title=Resident Evil Review, Resident Evil GameCube Review - GameSpot.com | publisher=GameSpot | date=April 29, 2002 | accessdate=August 26, 2011 | author=Shane Satterfield}}</ref>

The game was made in an exclusivity agreement between Capcom and [[Nintendo]] that spanned three new ''Resident Evil'' games and is also known under the informal titles of ''Resident Evil: Remake'' or ''Resident Evil: Rebirth'' (abbreviated ''REmake'' and ''REbirth'', respectively). In 2004, it was re-released in the ''Pure Evil 2-Pack'' (''Biohazard Double Feature'' in Japan) along with ''[[Resident Evil Zero]]'' and a demo of ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''.<ref>[http://uk.cube.gamespy.com/gamecube/pure-evil-2-pack-contains-resident-evil-resident-evil-0/ Pure Evil 2-Pack (contains Resident Evil & Resident Evil 0) - GameCube - GameSpy]</ref> The 2009 [[Wii]] version, titled '''''Resident Evil Archives: Resident Evil''''',<ref>{{cite web|author=Tom Bramwell |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/resident-evil-wiimake-out-this-june |title=Resident Evil Wiimake out this June News &#124; Wii &#124; Eurogamer |publisher=Eurogamer |date=2009-04-28 |accessdate=2010-02-02}}</ref> features a slightly different control system.

The game was released to very positive reviews, often described as the best ''Resident Evil'' title yet as well as one of the most visually impressive video games overall, and was a commercial success. Several publications also included it on the lists of the scariest games ever made.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Resident Evil GCN remake.png|thumb|left|A room with the puzzle as it appears in the remake with enhanced environment and character graphics. In this scene, [[Chris Redfield|Chris]] attacks a zombie with a dagger, one of several new defense items.]]

The game is notable for its nearly photorealistic environments, all of which are [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]]. The remake features all-new [[computer graphics|graphics]] and sound, and also incorporates [[gameplay]] elements from the later installments such as the use of [[body language]] to indicate the main character's health and the 180-degree turn. In addition, it  introduced a new running style that was also used in ''[[Resident Evil Zero]]'', and several new areas were added to the game (some of them were originally cut from the 1996 game during its development, such as a graveyard and a path in the woods). 

Gameplay mechanics are largely the same although most of the puzzles have been changed and the player can equip a defensive weapon that can be used when seized by an enemy. These defensive weapons include a dagger which can be used by both playable characters, whilst they also each have their own defensive weapon exclusive to them. [[Jill Valentine]] uses a [[taser]], while [[Chris Redfield]] is able to shove [[stun grenade]]s into the zombies' mouths to detonate them with a pistol shot.<ref name=ign>Lucas M. Thomas, [http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/05/24/revisiting-the-resident-evil-remake Revisiting the Resident Evil Remake], IGN, May 24, 2012</ref> These weapons can be set to either automatic or manual use by the player, saving them from taking damage, although they can be used only when grabbed by a monster. The zombies that are defeated but not destroyed (decapitated or burned) are mutating later in the game as the fast, dangerous and very aggressive Crimson Heads.<ref name=psu/>

It also features an [[Unlockable (gaming)|unlockable]] difficulty setting called Real Survival,<ref>[http://uk.ign.com/cheats/games/resident-evil-gcn-17045 Resident Evil Cheats, Codes, Unlockables - GameCube - IGN]</ref> which eliminates manual aiming and the "fourth dimensional" item box system, effectively forcing the player to plan their actions even more carefully ahead in order to avoid heavy backtracking.

==Plot==
{{further2|[[Resident Evil (video game)#Plot|Plot of the original version]]}}

The overall plot remains largely unchanged, featuring members of an American special police force trapped in a mystery mansion filled with undead monsters and deadly traps. The original live-action [[Full motion video based game|FMV]] segments were redone in [[computer graphics|CG]], with the [[voice acting]] done by a new cast. The script was rewritten to have a more serious tone and improved translation, as opposed to the unprofessional dialogue and roughly-translated script of the original.<ref name=psu/>

Additionally, the remake features many unlockable game modes, secrets, and various endings not found in the original. It also restores the George Trevor [[subplot]] featuring [[Lisa Trevor]], and [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively]] splices other major characters of the ''Resident Evil'' games, such as [[William Birkin]] and [[Alexia Ashford]], into the game's backstory.

==Development==
According to [[PSU.com]], "Backgrounds are meticulously realized and lack the staleness of past iterations thanks to the layers of [[Full motion video|FMV]] thrown in to simulate effects such as rushing water and swaying tree branches in the wind, while characters models are an equally sumptuous visual feast, with both enemies and humans alike casting ominous shadows across the game<U+2019>s dark, decrepit environments. Nintendo<U+2019>s purple box also facilitated dynamic [[Particle system|particle affects]] such as blood, water and fire, with the near indiscernible line between pre-rendered and real-time a fine testament to the raw talent emanating from the Capcom code house."<ref name=psu/>

==Wii version==
A Wii version of the ''Resident Evil'' remake originally released for the GameCube was released in Japan on December 25, 2008. As with the previous Wii version of ''[[Resident Evil Zero]]'', the game saw minimal changes in its transition to the Wii.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/912/912984p1.html |title=Resident Evil Set for Wii}}</ref>
