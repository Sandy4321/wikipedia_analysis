[[Pitchfork Media]]'s Jordan Sagent viewed that the EP "isn't blowing the doors off of anything, but plenty of rappers have trouble releasing records this tight and thematically consistent, and ultimately, Hodgy makes his name and money with [[MellowHype]], and that group has shown no signs of slowing down."<ref name="pitchy">{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16355-untitled-ep/|title=Hodgy Beats: Untitled EP REVIEW|publisher=Pitchfork Media|author=Sargent, Jordan |date=2012-03-07|accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref> [[Exclaim!]]'s Gregory Drakes praised the track "Lamented", writing that the "strangely interesting production still amazes", and "for those who are still a bit weary about Odd Future, Hodgy Beats' Untitled EP is good appetizer even for the ficklest consumers."<ref name="exlcaim">{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/HipHop/hodgy_beats-untitled_ep_2|title=Hodgy Beats Untitled EP|publisher=[[Exclaim!]].

[[Sputnikmusic]]'s Sobhi Youssef stated that Hodgy had matured as a performer, improving both his [[Flow (rapping)|flow]] and beat selection, though noted that the EP offered very little replay value, and that no track "really stuck out".<ref name="sputnik">{{cite web|last=Youssef|first=Sobhi|date=2012-07-4|url=http://sputnikmusic.com/review/50654/Hodgy-Beats-Untitled/|title=Hodgy Beats Untitled (staff review)|publisher=[[Sputnikmusic]]|accessdate=2012-07-15}}</ref> Drew Malmuth of Pretty Much Amazing wrote that "considering all the dreck out there it<U+2019>s hard to gripe too much about a hip-hop release with good production and lyricism that has bursts of real quality", though mused that the project sounded "distinctly underdeveloped in comparison to top-tier hip-hop".<ref name="amazing">{{cite web|url=http://prettymuchamazing.com/reviews/albumreviews/untitled|title=Review: Hodgy Beats <U+2013> Untitled EP |publisher=Pretty Much Amazing|author=Malmuth, Drew |date=2012-03-15|accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref>
