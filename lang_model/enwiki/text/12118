'''Hakan K<U+0131>ran''' is a Turkish architect, noted for his buildings in [[Istanbul]]. He is probably best known for designing the [[Golden Horn Metro Bridge]] with [[Michel Virlogeux]], in which he was responsible for the architectural design and the construction supervision. He founded Hakan Kiran Architecture and Building Services in 1989.<ref name="a1"/>

==Early years==
Hakan K<U+0131>ran was raised in a mining town that was constructed by the French. The extraordinary concept of his hometown impressed him. Much satisfied by the town's planning, he steered for studying architecture.<ref name="kpd"/>

In 1980, he entered State Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul (lang-tr|<U+0130>stanbul Devlet G<U+00FC>zel Sanatlar Akademisi), today [[Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University]], and studied [[art restoration]].<ref name="a1"/><ref name="kpd"/>

During his education and some time after his graduation, he worked in an architecture office.<ref name="kpd"/>

==Career==
Hakan K<U+0131>ran established his own office in 1989, and worked mainly on art restoration projects.<ref name="kpd"/>

His first main architectural design project was "Mydonose Showland" in 1998, an entertainment center across [[Atat<U+00FC>rk International Airport]] in [[Bak<U+0131>rk<U+00F6>y]] district.<ref name="kpd"/> However the complex, renamed later to Istanbul Show Center ({{lang-tr|Istanbul G<U+00F6>steri Merkezi}}), was demolished in 2009 after a fire destroyed it in April that year.<ref name="cnn1"/><ref name="s1"/>

In 2004, he designed the Golden Horn Metro Bridge, which was commissioned by the Istanbul Metropoitan Municipality. The [[cable-stayed bridge]] has a [[swing bridge]] at one end and features a metro station in the middle. Its realization took almost ten years as a result of revisions needed to comply with [[UNESCO]] regulations requiring it not to disturb the old city's skyline.<ref name="h4"/><ref name="h7"/>

He designed and built a project named "Larus Palas" worth US$30 million in the G<U+00F6>kt<U+00FC>rk neighborhood of Istanbul's [[Ey<U+00FC>p]] district, which was completed in 2013 and consists of 82 domiciles, 18 stores as well as facilities for sports, recreation and social activities.<ref name="h3"/><ref name="h5"/>

==Family life==
Hakan K<U+0131>ran's wife is also an architect. Beside their main education, the couple studied also music. The K<U+0131>rans have two daughters, Dilara and <U+0130>pek, and a son, Hakan.<ref name="h1"/>

==Awards==
In 2011, K<U+0131>ran was awarded with "European Real Estate Prize" for his design of the "Rings Istanbul" project, which features 1,500 domiciles, a shopping mall and social facilities built on {{convert|230000|m2|acre|abbr=on}} in [[Sancaktepe]] district of Istanbul.<ref name="h2"/><ref name="h6"/>
