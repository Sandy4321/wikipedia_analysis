The '''Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party''' was an organized faction within the [[Socialist Party of America]] in 1919 which served as the core of the dual [[communist]] parties which emerged in the fall of that year <U+2014> the [[Communist Party of America]] and the [[Communist Labor Party|Communist Labor Party of America]].

A generalized Left wing had existed prior to 1919, but lacked organizational cohesion. A Socialist Propaganda League had been formed in Boston and by late 1918 had succeeded in taking over the Boston local. The Boston newspaper, the ''[[Revolutionary Age]]'' became the major voice of the Left wing in late 1918 and early 1919. In New York a specific Left wing group within the party had been formed in February 1919, and began publishing the ''[[New York Communist]]''.<ref>[[Draper, Theodore]] ''The roots of American communism'' New York, [[Viking Press]] pp. 144-45</ref> After the National Executive Committee voided the election returns to a new executive committee, which would have a left majority, and expelled several Left wing locals and federations in May 1919, the Leftist groups decided to meet in a conference in late June. <ref>pp.137-58</ref> 

At the conference however, there was still much dissension. The seven expelled federations and the Michigan party demanded that the Left wing go ahead and form a communist party, while the group around the ''Revolutionary Age'' still wanted to try to take over the Socialist party at its September convention. The Federations and the Michigan group walked out and formed a National Organization Committee, which was set on organizing a founding Communist convention to rival the socialist convention in September. They also began publishing their own newspaper, ''The Communist''. <ref>pp.166-67, 73</ref>

The majority founded the National Council of the Left Wing and planned to take retake the socialist organization and convention. The council members were [[Louis Fraina]], [[Charles Ruthenberg]], [[I.E. Ferguson]], [[John Ballam]], [[James Larkin]], [[Eadmon MacAlpine]], [[Benjamin Gitlow]], [[Maximilian Cohen]], and [[Bertram Wolfe]]. Ferguson was named national secretary and the ''Revolutionary Age'', with Fraina as editor, became the official organ.<ref>pp.166-68</ref>

The left wingers who had been elected to the new NEC but had been purged by the old NEC in May held a rump meeting in Chicago, on July 26-27 tabulating the votes for themselves and asking the national secretary, Adolph Germer, to had over the keys to the party headquarters. They were rebuffed. On July 28 the National council of the Left wing gave in and voted to attend the Chicago convention organized by the National Organizing Committee to form the [[Communist Party of America]].
Three members of the National Council, however, Gitlow, Larkin and MacAlpine, were adamantly opposed to this. They, together with [[John Reed]] and Alfred Wagnknecht, formed a new faction, with a new organ, the ''Voice of Labor''.<ref>pp.174-75</ref>

At the August 31 opening of the Socialist party convention the Reed-Gitlow group tried to enter and present their credentials, but were promptly thrown out of the hall with the help of the police. The Left wingers, joined by other socialist delegates who walked out of the convention in protest over the incident or for other disagreements with the socialist party, then meet in the billiards room on the first floor of the [[Machinists Hall]] in Chicago and formed the [[Communist Labor Party]].<ref>pp.176-79</ref>
