'''Farthingale''' is a term applied to any of several structures used under Western [[Europe]]an women's [[clothing]] in the late [[fifteenth century|fifteenth]] and [[sixteenth century|sixteenth centuries]] to support the [[skirt and dress|skirts]] into the desired shape. 

==Spanish farthingale==
The '''Spanish farthingale''' was a [[hoop skirt]]. Originally stiffened with the subtropical [[Arundo donax|Giant Reed]], later designs in the temperate climate zone were 
stiffened with osiers ([[willow]] cuttings), [[rope]],  or (from about 1580) [[baleen|whalebone]].  The name comes from Spanish ''verdugo'' 'green wood', because the dying stems of Giant Reed are rigid.

The earliest primary sources indicate that Princess Isabel of [[Portugal]] brought ''verdugadas'' with 14 hoops each with her to [[Spain]] on her marriage in the 1470s.  The earliest images of Spanish farthingales show hoops prominently displayed on the outer surfaces of skirts, although later they merely provided shape to the overskirt.  The Spanish princess [[Catherine of Aragon]] brought the fashion into England on her marriage to [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Prince Arthur]], eldest son of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in 1501.

Spanish farthingales were an essential element of [[Tudor period|Tudor]] fashion in England, and remained a fixture of conservative Spanish court fashion into the early seventeenth century (see [[Margaret of Austria (1584-1611)|Portrait of Queen Margaret of Austria, 1609]]).

==French farthingale==
The '''French farthingale''' or ''vertugadin'' is properly a crescent- or sausage-shaped pad stiffened with bent or whalebone and tied around the waist under the skirts; the resulting silhouette is broad and rounded over the hips with the skirt hanging freely in folds.  

This type of French farthingale seems to be the item called a ''roll'' in [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I's]] wardobe accounts.  It is the origin of the ''bumroll'' worn by Elizabethan [[living history|recreationists]].

The term ''French farthingale'' is also used for the ''wheel'' or ''drum farthingale'', a stiffened circular support for the drum-shaped silhouette worn in England the 1590s.

The farthingale is the ancestor of [[eighteenth century]] [[Pannier (clothing)|pannier]]s and of the [[nineteenth century]] [[crinoline]].
