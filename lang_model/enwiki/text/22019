'''Moazzam Begg''' (born 1968) is a [[United Kingdom|British]]/[[Pakistani]] [[Muslim]] who was held in [[extrajudicial detention]] in the [[Bagram Theater Internment Facility]] and the [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]], in [[Cuba]], by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] for nearly three years.<ref name=AkronBeacon060616> [[David Ignatius]], [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/13/AR2006061301501.html ''A Prison We Need to Escape''], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 14 June 2006</ref><ref name="Bran"/>  

According to the U.S., Begg was an [[enemy combatant]] and [[al-Qaeda]] member, recruited others for al-Qaeda, provided money and support to al-Qaeda training camps, received extensive military training in al-Qaeda-run terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, and prepared to fight U.S. or allied troops.<ref>[http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=132&fArticleId=2390006 "US Sticks to its Guns on four British Detainees," ''The South African Star'', 28 January 2005, accessed 20 Februrary 2010]</ref><ref name="dodds">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=f9oxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=B-UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3416,782197&dq=moazzam+begg+-pronunciation-guide&hl=en|title=In New Book, Former Prisoner Describes Beatings|last=Dodds|first=Palsley|date=7 March 2006|work=Times Daily |accessdate=20 February 2010}}</ref>  While Begg admits spending time at two Islamic militant training camps in Afghanistan, supporting militant Muslim fighters, buying a handgun, that he "thought about" taking up arms in Chechnya, and being an acquaintance of people linked to terrorism (most notably, [[Khalil al-Deek]], [[Dhiren Barot]], and Shahid Akram Butt), he denies the remainder of the U.S.'s allegations.

Begg says that when he was incarcerated at Bagram, though not in Guantanamo Bay to which he was later moved, he was [[hog-tied]], kicked, punched, and left in a room with a bag put over his head, even though he suffered from asthma. A Pentagon spokesman said there was "no credible evidence that Begg was ever abused by U.S. forces".  Begg also claimed that while at Bagram, he witnessed two other detainees being beaten to death.  After intensive discussions with the U.K. government, President Bush had him released without charge on 25 January 2005.  Bush released Begg over the objections of the [[Pentagon]], the [[CIA]], and the [[FBI]], who were concerned that Begg could still be a dangerous terrorist.<ref name="tim"/> 

After his release, he became a commentator on radio and television on issues pertaining to the UK Muslim community and UK and worldwide anti-terror measures, and toured as a speaker about his time in Guantanamo and other detention facilities.  He has also co-authored a book, and authored broadsheet and magazine pieces.<ref name="tim"/>  In 2010, [[Gita Sahgal]], then the head of [[Amnesty International]]'s gender unit, publicly condemned her organization for its collaboration with Begg, calling it "a gross error of judgment".<ref>[http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/5774326/the-human-wrongs-industry-spits-out-one-of-its-own.thtml "The human wrongs industry spits out one of its own", ''[[The Spectator]]'', 14 February 2010, accessed 20 February 2010]</ref>

During high school, Begg became a member of the [[Lynx Gang]], a Birmingham [[street gang]].<ref name="tim"/><ref name="Bran"/> Begg described the gang as consisting of teenage boys predominantly of Pakistani origin, but also boys who were Algerian, Asian, Afro-Caribbean, and even Irish.

On a family holiday to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan in his late teens, he became interested in Islam.<ref name="tim"/>  In late 1993 he returned to Pakistan, and crossed the Pakistani/Afghan border with the leader of the Lynx Gang, Syed Murad Meah Butt (known as Niaaz), and some fellow young Pakistanis near the city of [[Khost]].

Inspired by the commitment of the ''mujahedeen'', he also admits travelling to [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]] in the early 1990s to help the Muslims there during its civil war, where he was "terribly affected by some of the stories ... of the atrocities taking place there", and supporting militant Muslims there.<ref name="chan"/><ref name="tim"/><ref name="dodds"/>  In 1994 he joined a charity delivering aid to Muslims in Bosnia.<ref name="ordeal"/>  He travelled to Bosnian battle zones, and what he saw there led to his conviction that [[armed resistance]] could sometimes be justified.<ref name="Bran"/><ref name="broken"/>  He admits to "very briefly" joining the Bosnian Army Foreign Volunteer Force.<ref name="kings"/>  It was there that he first met [[Khalil Deek]].<ref name="Schou">{{cite news|url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2006-09-21/news/i-ve-never-been-to-america-america-came-to-me/|title='I've Never Been to America.

In 1995 Begg married.  By early 1998 Begg, moved with his wife and their two small children to [[Peshawar, Pakistan]], on the Afghan border.<ref name="tim"/>

==Afghanistan/Pakistan, July 2001-February 2002; arrest==
With his wife Zaynab and three young children, Begg moved to [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]], in  July 2001.<ref name="tim"/><ref name="Foggo"/> [[Taliban]]-ruled Afghanistan at that time protected [[Osama bin Laden]], banned music and most games, and severely restricted the education and medical treatment of women.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3651298/Why-did-Moazzam-Begg-travel-to-Afghanistan.html Palmer, Alisdair, "Why did Moazzam Begg travel to Afghanistan?", ''[[The Telegraph]]'', 2 April 2006, accessed 20 February 2010]</ref>  As ''The New York Times'' put it:  "Despite the Taliban's status as an international pariah for its treatment of women and its hospitality toward al-Qaeda, Begg saw it as a fine, inexpensive place to raise a family."<ref name="tim"/>  

He insists he moved to Kabul both because he was moved by the plight of the Afghan people living under the Taliban regime, and to fulfill his dream of being a teacher.  Begg maintains he began sponsoring a school for basic education from the U.K., providing books, teaching materials, and classroom and playground equipment.  He says he both started the school, and became a charity worker at it.  The school was to be for boys and girls, despite the fact that the Taliban regime opposed education for females and had not given him a license.<ref name="Schou"/><ref name="raban"/>  He says he also went there to build wells.<ref name="Schou"/><ref name="raban"/>  

In his book ''Enemy Combatant'', Begg recalls telling two U.S. agents who visited him in his Guantanamo Bay cell that:  <blockquote>I wanted to live in an Islamic state<U+2013>one that was free from the corruption and despotism of the rest of the Muslim world....

The Allied attack on Afghanistan began in October 2001, and following the Taliban's defeat, a U.S. Justice Department dossier on Begg indicates that he joined their retreat to the [[Tora Bora]] mountains, where he was <U+201C>prepared to fight in the front line against allied forces<U+201D>, according to the Pentagon.<ref name="simon"/><ref name="tim"/>  While in Afghanistan, he admits to buying a handgun.<ref name="dodds"/>   But he said that he and his family evacuated to [[Islamabad]] in Pakistan for safety.

====Possible POW status====

Begg did not claim [[Prisoner of War]] (POW) status, because he regarded himself as a civilian. However, he submitted a list of witnesses whom he wanted to testify on his behalf. He thought two of them, an employee of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and a U.S. officer, could testify that he been classified as a POW, and been issued a POW card by the U.S.  [[James Crisfield]], the legal advisor to the Tribunals, wrote:

<blockquote>The detainee proffered that this witness was an ICRC employee who would testify that the detainee had previously been issued a POW identity card at a U.S. detention facility in Kandahar, Afghanistan. The Tribunal President initially determined that the witness was relevant, but after consultation with the Assistant Legal Advisor, she changed her determination. She based her decision on her conclusion that the Combatant Status Review Tribunals do not have the discretion to determine that a detainee should be classified as a prisoner of war<U+2014>only whether the detainee satisfies the definition of "enemy combatant" as provided in references (a) and (b). In my opinion, this decision was correct.... [I]n a written statement prepared by the detainee especially for the CSRT, the detainee specifically says that he does ''not'' claim POW status (''see'' exhibit D-e).<ref name=CsrtMoazzamBeggPowStatus>

Begg's Personal Representative read a brief statement Begg had dictated.<ref name=CsrtMoazzamBeggStatement> [http://wid.ap.org/documents/detainees/moazzambegg.pdf#18 Moazzam Begg's statement (.pdf)] from Moazzam Begg's [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]], 15 September 2004, pages 18-19, hosted by the [[Associated Press]]</ref>

*challenging the Tribunal's President and the [[OARDEC]] legal advisor conclusion that the witness Begg requested, showing he had previously been classified as a POW were not relevant.
*challenging the Tribunal's fundamental justice, because: "the Tribunal was instructed to assume that the detainee is an enemy combatant does not provide a means of denying the detainee the right to rebut the presumption."
*asserting that "the Tribunal incorrectly ruled the above witnesses not relevant because they were not disputing that the detainee aided the Taliban or al-Qaida. POW status would not have precluded these facts from being true."
*disputing the Tribunal President's and legal advisor's assertion that Tribunals did not have the authority to agree to captive's requests to be truthfulness evaluated during a polygraph examination by a polygraph examiner.

His Personal Representative concluded: "The above-mentioned failure to view relevant testimony denied this detainee adequate due process as outlined in the order of the convening authority."<ref name="CsrtMoazzamBeggPRChallenge"/>

Bush released Begg as a favor to Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], who was being harshly criticized for his support of the Iraq war.<ref name="tim"/>  

On 25 January 2005, Begg and the three other British citizen detainees ([[Feroz Abbasi]], [[Martin Mubanga]], and [[Richard Belmar]]) were flown back to [[RAF Northolt]] in [[West London]], the U.K. on an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] aircraft.<ref name="still"/><ref name=Bbc050125>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4204041.stm Guantanamo four arrive back in UK], ''[[BBC]]'', 25 January 2005</ref>  On arrival they were arrested by officers from the [[Metropolitan Police]], and taken to [[Paddington Green]] police station for questioning under the [[Terrorism Act 2000]] by anti-terrorist officers.<ref name="still"/>  By 9 pm on 26 January, all four had been released without charge.

==Post-Release; January 2005-present==
===Allegations continue despite he was never charged with any offence===
Bush released Begg over the objections of the [[Pentagon]], the [[CIA]], and the [[FBI]], all of whom were concerned that Begg could still be a dangerous terrorist, overruling most of his senior national security advisers .<ref name="tim">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/15/world/15begg.html|title=Jihadist or Victim: Ex-Detainee Makes a Case|last=Golden|first=Tim|date=15 June 2006|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=19 February 2010}}</ref>  The Pentagon still maintains he was a terrorist.<ref name="tim"/>  

"He has strong, long-term ties to terrorism<U+2014>as a sympathizer, as a recruiter, as a financier and as a combatant," said a Defense Department spokesman, Bryan Whitman, after his release.<ref name="tim"/>  

Whitman added, quoting a single-spaced eight-page confession that Begg made while incarcerated, that Begg admitted: 

<blockquote>I was armed and prepared to fight alongside the Taliban and al-Qaeda against the U.S. and others, and eventually retreated to Tora Bora to flee from U.S. forces when our front lines collapsed.... [I] knowingly provided comfort and assistance to al-Qaeda members by housing their families, helped distribute al-Qaeda propaganda, and received members from terrorist camps knowing that certain trainees could become al-Qaeda operatives and commit acts of terrorism against the United States.<ref name="Bran"/><ref name="broken"/><ref name="dodds"/></blockquote>

Begg also said in his confession that he sympathized with the cause of al-Qaeda, trained in three al-Qaeda terrorist training camps in Afghanistan so that he could assist in waging global jihad against enemies of Islam, including Russia and India; associated with and assisted several prominent al-Qaeda terrorists and supporters of terrorists, and discussed potential terrorist acts with them; recruited young members for global jihad; and provided financial support for terrorist training camps.<ref name="Bran"/><ref name="broken"/><ref name="dodds"/><ref name="Joscelyn"/> 

Begg maintains his confession is false, and that he gave it while under duress.<ref name="dodds"/><ref name="Bran"/>  Whitman dismissed Begg's retreat from his confession as a clear lie, and  U.S. intelligence officials maintain that Begg's statement is in fact accurate.<ref name="dodds"/><ref name="broken"/>  The Department of Justice's [[Office of the Inspector General]] (OIG) investigated Begg's claim that the FBI forced him to sign his confession.<ref name="Joscelyn"/>   The OIG "concluded that the evidence did not support the allegation that [FBI agents] coerced Begg into signing the statement."<ref name="Joscelyn"/> 

Christopher Hogan, a former military interrogator who oversaw some of Begg's early questioning, said: "He provided us with excellent information routinely," and added:  "I don't think he was the mastermind of 9/11, but nor do I think he was just an innocent."<ref name="tim"/>  ''The New York Times'' reported in June 2006 that "Of nearly 20 American military and intelligence officials who were interviewed about Begg, none thought he had been wrongly detained. But some said they doubted that he could be tied to any terrorist acts."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/15/world/europe/15iht-begg.html?pagewanted=2 "Ex-prisoner an adversary in a war of perception", ''The New York Times'', 15 June 2006, 20 February 2010]</ref>

In February 2005, British [[Home Secretary]] [[Charles Clarke]] used the [[Royal Prerogative]], historic powers enjoyed by the monarchy which have been passed to politicians, to refuse to issue Begg a passport.  He did so based on information obtained while Begg was in U.S. custody leading to the belief that "there are strong grounds for believing that, on leaving the United Kingdom, [Begg] would take part in activities against the United Kingdom or allied targets."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4272171.stm "Passport ban for two more Britons", BBC News, 26 February 2005, accessed 20 February 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/feb/12/terrorism.september11 "UK claims freed Britons pose terror threat", ''The Guardian'', 12 February 2005, accessed 20 Februrary 2010]</ref>

Since his release, while Begg has said he is against attacks such as 9/11, he said he supported fighting British soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1559666/Channel-4-platform-for-radical-who-wants-war.html Gardham, Duncan, "Channel 4 platform for radical who wants 'war'", ''The Daily Telegraph'', 7 August 2007, 20 February 2010]</ref>

"It is now clear that there is a systemic problem of abuse throughout the US military's detention facilities<U+2014>not merely misbehaviour by [[bad apples excuse|a few bad apples]]."  ''The Muslim News'' called it an "open, honest and touching account".<ref>[http://www.muslimnews.co.uk/paper/index.php?article=2446 Abbas, Tahir, "Book Review - <U+2018>Open, honest and touching account of an ordinary British-born Muslim<U+2019>", ''The Muslim News'', 26 May 2006, 21 February 2010]</ref>  Begg was named "best British author" for the book, at the annual Muslim Writers awards in March 2008.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3647621.ece?print=yes&randnum=1151003209000 "Award for Guantanamo ex-inmate", ''Daily Times'', 30 March 2008, accessed 20 February 2010]</ref> 

But ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported "some notable gaps in Mr. Begg's memoir", in that he did not mention a previous arrest, nor some of his alleged ties to terrorism.<ref name="tim"/>  ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' said: "Begg has been less than forthcoming about his criminal past ... his cooperation with interrogators ... and his ties to terrorism".<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sandiego/access/1125992731.html?dids=1125992731:1125992731&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+10%2C+2006&author=John+Wilkens&pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&desc=BARS+AND+STRIPES+|+In+Moazzam+Begg%27s+%60Imprisonment%2C%27+Uncle+Sam+is+a+cruel+warden&pqatl=google Wilkins, John, "Bars and Stripes; In Moazzam Begg's `Imprisonment,' Uncle Sam is a cruel warden," ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'', 10 September 2006, accessed 21 February 2010]</ref>  And [[Jonathan Raban]], reviewing it for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', wrote:  

<blockquote>One has the sense of reading not a memoir but a r<U+00E9>sum<U+00E9>. Like most r<U+00E9>sum<U+00E9>s, it feels airbrushed. It is a strategic (one might almost say a "campaign") biography ... Begg's travels [during the time the U.S. maintains he was with the Taliban] get confusing, and plotting them on an atlas only adds to the reader's puzzlement.... The gaps in his story<U+2014>and they're more frustrating than downright suspicious<U+2014>cease at the moment when Begg enters captivity.... ''Enemy Combatant'' has been praised in Britain for Begg's outstanding liberality of mind and evenhandedness toward his captors.... Unfortunately, these relationships are rendered in long passages of direct speech, and Begg and/or his coauthor are notably talentless at writing dialogue.... Perhaps Begg really did strike up a warm relationship with soldier Jennifer, but all one can say of the words on the page is that they are resoundingly phony. Only in bad fiction do people speak this way, and true though Begg's story may well be in its essential facts, it is very poorly served by line after line of rankly implausible writing.<ref name="raban"/></blockquote>

===Begg's lawsuit against the British government ===
In April 2008, Begg and other former Guant<U+00E1>namo detainees filed lawsuits at Britain's [[High Court]] against the British attorney general, Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary, MI5, and [[MI6]], accusing them of for unlawful acts, negligence, and conspiracy in their abduction, treatment, and interrogation, and seeking millions of dollars in damages.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/world/europe/20iht-guantanamo.1.12161711.html "Former Guant<U+00E1>namo detainees sue British government", ''The New York Times'', 20 April 2008, accessed 20 February 2010]</ref>  The defendants denied the claims, but admitted that MI5 interviewed some detainees and provided questions to be put to them by other interrogators, saying:  

<blockquote>The security service undertook this role because, as the UK agency with the most experience of running intelligence-led [[counter-terrorist]] investigations in the UK, it was best placed to understand and utilise the information received about threats against the UK, or involving British nationals.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/nov/18/secret-services-can-hide-evidence "Judge allows secret services to hide evidence in civil lawsuits", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 November 2009, accessed 20 February 2010]</ref></blockquote>

===Guantanamo video game; 2009===
In 2009 Begg was a technical advisor, and slated to appear as himself, for [[Scotland|Scottish]] software company T-Enterprise in the development of a [[video game]] entitled [[Rendition: Guantanamo]], for [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox 360]].

Conservative pundits such as ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'''s Tom Joscelyn and radio host [[Rush Limbaugh]] attacked the game and the company, when the game and Begg's involvement were made public, and a great number of e-mail messages to the company from Americans expressed disappointment and outrage.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/GameOn/story?id=7750809&page=1 Heussner, Ki Mae, "Games About Religion, Sex and Violence Cross the Line, ABC News, 4 June 2009, accessed 20 February 2010]</ref>  T-Enterprise did not complete the game because of U.S. press coverage, which it described as "inaccurate and ill informed speculation", saying that "many conclusions were reached that have absolutely no foundation whatsoever."<ref name="TEnterprise" />

===Speaker and activist ===
As Director for the prisoner rights organisation, [[Cageprisoners]], Begg has appeared in the media and around the country, lecturing on issues pertaining to the UK Muslim community, imprisonment without trial, torture, anti-terror legislation and measures, and community relations.  

He has appeared as a commentator on radio and television interviews and documentaries, including the [[BBC]]'s ''Panorama''<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/4311768.stm Blair v Blair], ''BBC'', 10 October 2005</ref> and ''Newsnight''<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/4534998.stm Newsnight on trial], ''BBC'', 16 December 2005</ref> shows,  [[PBS]]'s ''The Prisoner'',<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/230/index.html ''The Prisoner''], PBS, 28 July 2006</ref> [[Al-Jazeera]]'s ''[[Prisoner 345]]'', ''[[Taking Liberties (film)|Taking Liberties]]'', and ''[[Torturing Democracy]]'', and [[National Geographic]]'s ''Guantanamo's Secrets''.<ref>[http://natgeotv.com/uk/guantanamo's-secrets Guantanamo's Secrets], ''National Geographic''</ref>  He has also authored pieces that appeared in broadsheets and magazines.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/moazzambegg "Profile:  Moazzam Begg", [[The Guardian]]]</ref><ref>Begg, Moazzam, [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/14/opinion/14iht-edbegg.html Guant<U+00E1>namo's Catch-22], ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', 14 September 2006</ref><ref>Begg, Moazzam, [http://www.newstatesman.com/200606260020 Tortured Truth], ''[[New Statesman]]'', 26 June 2006</ref><ref>John, Patrice, [http://www.birminghammail.net/news/top-stories/2008/03/31/birmingham-hosts-the-muslim-writers-awards-97319-20697692/ Birmingham hosts the Muslim Writers Awards], ''Birmingham Mail'', 31 March 2008</ref>

Begg has spoken alongside [[Amnesty International]] at a number of events, and accompanied it to a meeting at [[Downing Street]].<ref name="mel">{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/5774326/the-human-wrongs-industry-spits-out-one-of-its-own.thtml|title=The human wrongs industry spits out one of its own|last=Phillips|first=Melanie|date=14 February 2010|work=The Spectator|accessdate=23 February 2010}}</ref>  In 2010, [[Gita Sahgal]], then the head of Amnesty's gender unit, publicly condemned her organization for its collaboration with Begg, saying that it "constitutes a threat to human rights."
