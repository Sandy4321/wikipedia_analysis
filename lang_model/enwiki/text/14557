'''Regional Railways''' was one of the three passenger sectors of [[British Rail]] created in [[1981]] that existed until [[1996]] a year before [[Privatisation]]. The sector was originally called '''Provincial''', and ran regional non-express services.

The other passenger regions created in the [[1980s]] were [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity]] (express services) and [[Network SouthEast]] (principally [[London]] [[commuter]] services) (see [[British Rail brand names]] for a full history).

Regional Railways was the most subsidised (per passenger km) of the three sectors.

==Sprinterisation==

Regional Railways' main achievement was the "sprinterisation" of the system in order to reduce costs.  Older locomotive-hauled trains were replaced by new [[Diesel multiple unit]]s (DMUs) in two large groups of classes.  The first, [[Pacer (train)|''Pacers'']], used bus technology, from the [[Leyland National]], in classes numbered in the [[List of British Rail classes#Pacers|14X range]].  ''Sprinters'' were assigned class numbers in the [[List of British Rail classes#Sprinters|15X range]]; most were based on the Mk3 (Cl 150-156) carriage.

The late 1980s and early 1990s also saw the development of secondary express services that complemented the mainline [[InterCity (British Rail)|Intercity]] routes.  In particular, key Scottish and Transpennine routes were upgraded with new [[British Rail Class 158|Class 158]] Express Sprinters, while a network of '[[Alphaline]]' services was introduced elsewhere in the country.
