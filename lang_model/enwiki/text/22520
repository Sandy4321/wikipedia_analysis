The '''''Georgii Pobedonosets''''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0413><U+0435><U+043E><U+0440><U+0433><U+0438><U+0439> <U+041F><U+043E><U+0431><U+0435><U+0434><U+043E><U+043D><U+043E><U+0441><U+0435><U+0446>}} [[Saint George]] the Victorious) was a [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]], the fourth and final ship of the {{sclass|Ekaterina II|battleship|4}}. She was, however, only a [[sister ship|half-sister]] to the others as her armor scheme was different and she was built much later than the earlier ships. She participated in the pursuit of the mutinous battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Potemkin||2}} in June 1905,<ref group=Note>All dates used in this article are [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]]</ref> but her crew mutinied themselves. However, loyal crew members regained control of the ship the next day and they ran her aground when ''Potemkin'' threatened to fire on her if she left [[Odessa]] harbor. She was relegated to second-line duties in 1908. She fired on the {{SMS|Goeben||2}} during her bombardment of [[Sevastopol]] in 1914, but spent most of the war serving as a headquarters ship in Sevastopol. She was captured by both sides during the [[Russian Civil War]], but ended up being towed to [[Bizerte]] by the fleeing [[White movement|White Russians]] where she was eventually scrapped.

==Design and development==
[[File:Ekaterina II class battleship diagrams Brasseys 1896.jpg|thumb|left|300px|<center>Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1896</center>]]
''Georgii Pobedonosets'' was originally intended as a version of {{ship|Russian battleship|Sinop||2}} rearmed with three {{convert|12|in|sp=us|adj=on}} and four {{convert|9|in|sp=us|adj=on}} guns, but this changed when the decision was made to provide her with three twin 12-inch [[turret]]s rather than the [[barbette]]s used by her sisters. The turrets were significantly heavier than the barbette mountings so the armour scheme was revised in compensation. However this revised design was still deemed overweight and rejected. The Naval Ministry held a competition for a replacement, but these were rejected by the Naval Technical Committee in turn. So a modified version of ''Sinop'', with barbettes, was chosen again as the most readily available choice. The height of her armour was lowered to reduce the overweight condition of her half-sisters. Other changes were made while building, but they came early in the process and did not seriously delay her completion past her contractual date of 13 September 1893. These changes included smaller mountings for her main guns that eliminated the [[sponson]]s needed in her sisters for the forward barbettes, the substitution of 35-[[Caliber#Caliber_as_measurement_of_length|calibre]] guns for the older 30-calibre guns and steel armor imported from [[Schneider Electric|Schnider et Cie]] of [[France]] replaced the [[compound armour]] used in her half-sisters.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 61</ref>

''Georgii Pobedonosets'' was {{convert|347|ft|6|in|m|1}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|339|ft|4|in|m|1}} long [[length overall|overall]]. She had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|68|ft|11|in|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|27|ft|11|in|m|1}}. She displaced {{convert|11032|LT|t|lk=on}} at load, over {{convert|700|LT|MT|abbr=on}} more than her designed displacement of {{convert|10280|LT|t|abbr=on}}.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 60</ref>

She had two 3-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple expansion steam engines]] driving [[screw propeller]]s {{convert|16|ft|5|in|m|1}} in diameter. Sixteen cylindrical [[Boiler (steam generator)|boilers]] provided steam to the engines. The engines and boilers were both imported from [[Maudslay and Sons]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and were {{convert|114|LT|t}} overweight. The engines had a total designed output of {{convert|10000|ihp|lk=on}}, but they only produced {{convert|9843|ihp|abbr=on}} on trials and gave a top speed of {{convert|16.5|knots}}. At full load she carried {{convert|900|LT|MT}} of coal that provided her a range of {{convert|2800|nmi|lk=on}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}} and {{convert|1367|nmi}} at {{convert|14.5|kn}}.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 60, 63<U+2013>64</ref>

Her main armament consisted of three pairs of {{convert|12|in|mm|0|adj=on}} Obukhov Model 1886 35-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] guns mounted in two twin [[barbette]] mounts side by side forward and one aft of the superstructure. They had a maximum elevation of 15<U+00B0> and could depress to -2<U+00B0>. Each of the forward mounts could traverse 30<U+00B0> across the bow and 35<U+00B0> abaft the beam, or a total of 155<U+00B0>. The rear mount could traverse 202<U+00B0>. Their rate of fire was one round every four minutes, fifty seconds, including training time.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 61, 63</ref> They fired a {{convert|731.3|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2090|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to a range of {{convert|11600|yd|m}} at maximum elevation. They also had a 'heavy' shell available that weighed {{convert|1003|lb|kg|abbr=on}} that was fired at a velocity of {{convert|2000|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} although the range is not available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNRussian_12-35_m1886.htm|title=Russian 12"/35 (30.5 cm) Pattern 1886|date=11 September 2006 |accessdate=5 January 2010}}</ref>

The seven {{convert|6|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[6 inch 35-calibre naval gun 1877|Model 1877]] 35-calibre guns were mounted on broadside pivot mounts in hull embrasures, except for one gun mounted in the stern in the hull. The eight {{convert|47|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} single-barrelled [[Hotchkiss gun]]s were mounted on the battery deck to defend the ship against [[torpedo boat]]s. Ten {{convert|37|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} Hotchkiss guns were mounted in the [[Top (sailing ship)|fighting top]]. She carried seven above-water {{convert|14|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, three tubes on each broadside and a tube in the stern.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 27, 63</ref>

In contrast to her half-sisters the armour used on ''Georgii Pobedonosets'' was steel. The [[belt armor]] had a maximum thickness of {{convert|16|in}} which reduced, in {{convert|2|in|sp=us|adj=on}} steps, down to {{convert|6|in}} forward and down to {{convert|8|in}} aft. Its height was reduced by {{convert|1|ft}} in comparison to the other ships of the class to {{convert|7|ft}} to reduce weight. However this left only six inches of her belt above her load waterline as she was still overweight, a decrease of {{convert|7|in}} from her half-sisters. The deck armour was {{convert|2.25|in}} outside the citadel and reduced to {{convert|1.5|in}} over it.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 63</ref>

==Service history==
''Georgii Pobedonosets'' was named after [[Saint George]] the Victorious. She was built by the [[Sevastopol Shipyard|Russian Steam Navigation Company (RoPIT)]] at [[Sevastopol]]. She was laid down on 5 May 1891, launched in 9 March 1892, and completed in 1893, although her trials lasted until mid-1895.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 60, 64</ref> She spent her career in the [[Black Sea Fleet]]. She began her trials in September 1893, but they were not completed until the middle of 1895.<ref name=m4>McLaughlin, p. 64</ref> She participated in the pursuit of the mutinous battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Potemkin||2}} in June 1905 to [[Odessa]], but her crew [[Mutiny|mutinied]] themselves. However, the next day loyal crew members regained control of the ship and they ran her aground and surrendered to the authorities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zebroski|first=Robert|title=The Battleship Potemkin and its Discontents, 1905|editor=Bell, Christopher M., and Bruce A. Elleman|publisher=Frank Cass|location=London|date=2003|series=Naval Mutinies of the Twentieth Century: an International Perspective|page=21|isbn=0714654604}}</ref>

In 1907 the Naval General Staff made a proposal for a radical reconstruction that was similar to the proposals to reconstruct {{ship|Russian battleship|Chesma||2}} and {{ship|Russian battleship|Sinop||2}} made before the [[Russo-Japanese War]] that involved cutting her down by one deck and replacing her armament with two twin-gun turrets equipped with 12-inch 40-calibre guns and the compound armor replaced by [[Krupp armor]]. This new proposal differed from the older one in that eight {{convert|120|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} guns replaced the ten six-inch guns originally planned. This was rejected as the she still would have lacked the speed to stay with the main fleet and the hull protection required to withstand high-explosive shell fire.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 287</ref>

She became a training ship in 1908 and her 6-inch 35-calibre guns were replaced by modern 6-inch 45-calibre guns. She was modified as a harbour guard ship in 1911 and her 12-inch guns were removed. Six more six-inch guns were added for a total of fourteen.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 292</ref><ref>Conway's, p. 178</ref> She fired three rounds, missing each time, at the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben||2}} during her bombardment of Sevastopol on 29 October 1914, but spent the bulk of World War I as a static headquarters ship in Sevastopol. After the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] she joined the Red Black Sea Fleet in December 1917 <ref>29 <U+0434><U+0435><U+043A><U+0430><U+0431><U+0440><U+044F> 1917 <U+0433><U+043E><U+0434><U+0430> <U+0432><U+043E><U+0448><U+0435><U+043B> <U+0432> <U+0441><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+0430><U+0432> <U+041A><U+0440><U+0430><U+0441><U+043D><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+0427><U+0435><U+0440><U+043D><U+043E><U+043C><U+043E><U+0440><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+0444><U+043B><U+043E><U+0442><U+0430>  http://flot.sevastopol.info/ship/brone/georgiy_pobedonosetc.htm </ref>. She was captured by the Germans in 1918 in [[Sevastopol]] and was handed over to the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in December 1918. The British sabotaged her engines on 25 April 1919. She was captured by both sides in the [[Russian Civil War]], but eventually became part of [[Wrangel's fleet]] and was towed to Bizerte in 1920. She was sold for scrap between 1930 and 1936.<ref name=m4/>
