'''Deborah Rabinowitz''' (September 9, 1947 <U+2014> August 18, 1987) was a highly praised ecologist who coined the seven meanings of rarity in the field of [[plant ecology]],<ref name="memoriam">{{cite web|url=http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/19292/2/Rabinowitz_Deborah_1987.pdf|title=Deborah Rabinowitz|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2014-12-14}}</ref><ref name="seven">Rabinowitz, D.

==Early Life and Education==
Deborah Rabinowitz was born and raised in [[Willimantic]], Connecticut to Louis and Margaret Rabinowitz. Here she attended a public education and then later received her undergraduate degree in Biology from [[New College]] in [[Sarasota]], Florida. In 1975, she received her Ph.D. in theoretical [[population biology]] from the [[University of Chicago]].<ref name="article" />  

Her dissertation here was on focused mangroves. Her interest in mangrove ecology and zonation began during her time as an undergraduate at New College. Previous literature and speculation on why mangrove swamps are zoned had mostly looked at the different tolerances for physical conditions along tidal gradients among species. Rabinowitz grew each type of panama mangroves and found that all the species survived in all the zones. She then moved on to determining if the real problem lied with [[dispersal]]. The tides would disperse seeds by their differences in size and weight. Bigger seeds, would move further and  deeper in seaward substrate, whereas smaller seeds would be found landward. From her data, Rabinowitz found a strong correlation between the size of the seed and zones of several regions. She continued to study mangrove ecology, transforming our understanding to what it is today. <ref name="seven">Rabinowitz, D. (1981). Seven forms of rarity.</ref><ref name="article" /> 

She later became the first female faculty member in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the [[University of Michigan]]. Finally, in 1982 she received a tenured faculty position at Cornell studying the fields of Ecology and Systematics within the Division of Biological Sciences. Deborah was diagnosed with cancer and died in August 1987 at the age of 39,<ref name="memoriam" /><ref name="article" /> . 

==Career==
Her study involved finding out about rare plants. In 1981, she published a paper that described seven different meanings for the concept of <U+201C>rarity<U+201D> using British flora,.<ref name="seven" />. Her most notable discovery was that <U+2018>frequent type rarity<U+2019> is the class of sparse species with largest geographical range<ref>Rabinowitz, D., Cairns, S., & Dillon, T. (1986). Seven forms of rarity and their frequency in the flora of the British Isles.</ref><ref name="article" /> . Deborah took interest in international politics and was active in demonstrations,<ref name="memoriam" /><ref name="article" />

Rabinowitz served as a committee member on the National Science Foundation, the National Academy of Sciences and the Ecological Society of America. She was a frequent reviewer for a number of scholarly articles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituaries - Deborah Rabinowitz|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat=19870826&id=uu4gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MnIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5099,6197720|publisher=The Day|accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref>
