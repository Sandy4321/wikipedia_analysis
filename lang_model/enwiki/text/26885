The initial design for what became Sun's first Unix workstation, the [[Sun 1]], was conceived by [[Andy Bechtolsheim]] when he was a graduate student at [[Stanford University]] in [[Palo Alto]], [[California]]. He originally designed the [[SUN workstation]] for the [[Stanford University Network]] communications project as a personal [[CAD]] [[workstation]].  It was designed as a [[3M computer]]: 1 MIPS, 1 Megabyte and 1 Megapixel.  It was designed around the  [[Motorola 68000]] processor with an advanced [[Memory management unit]] (MMU) to support the [[Unix]] operating system with virtual memory support.<ref>[ftp://reports.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/csl/tr/82/229/CSL-TR-82-229.pdf The SUN Workstation Architecture, Andreas Bechtolsheim, Forest Baskett, Vaughan Pratt, Stanford University Computer systems Laboratory Technical Report No. 229, March 1982]</ref>  He built the first ones from spare parts obtained  from Stanford's [[Stanford University School of Engineering|Department of Computer Science]] and Silicon Valley supply houses.<ref>[http://www.stanford.edu/group/wellspring/sun_spotlight.html Wellspring of Innovation: Sun Microsystems Spotlight<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On February 12, 1982 [[Vinod Khosla]], Andy Bechtolsheim, and [[Scott McNealy]], all Stanford graduate students, founded ''Sun Microsystems''.  [[Bill Joy]] of Berkeley, a primary developer of [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], joined soon after and is counted as one of the original founders.<ref>http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b02/en/common/item_detail.jhtml?id=390049 VINOD KHOSLA AND SUN MICROSYSTEMS, Amar Bhide, Harvard Business School, 12/14/89</ref>  The Sun name is derived from the initials of the [[Stanford University Network]].  Sun was profitable from its first quarter in July 1982.

Sun's initial public offering was in 1986 under the [[stock symbol]] ''SUNW'', for ''Sun Workstations'' (later ''Sun Worldwide'').<ref>{{ cite web

}}</ref> The symbol was changed in 2007 to ''JAVA''; Sun stated that the [[brand awareness]] associated with its [[Java platform]] better represented the company's current strategy.<ref>[http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/newsanalysis/techhardware/10376053.html?cm_ven=YAHOO&amp;cm_cat=FREE&amp;cm_ite=NA Sun to Switch Symbol to JAVA]</ref>

Sun's logo, which features [[ambigram|four interleaved copies]] of the word ''sun'', was designed by professor [[Vaughan Pratt]], also of Stanford University. The initial version of the logo had the sides oriented horizontally and vertically, but it was subsequently redesigned so as to appear to stand on one corner.

The first Sun workstations ran a [[Version 7 Unix]] System port by [[UniSoft]] on [[Motorola 68000|68000]] processor-based machines.

=== The "Bubble" and its aftermath ===

During the [[dot-com bubble]], Sun experienced dramatic growth in revenue, profits, share price, and expenses.  Some part of this was due to genuine expansion of demand for web-serving cycles, but another part was synthetic, fueled by [[venture capital]]-funded [[startup]]s building out large, expensive Sun-centric server presences in the expectation of high traffic levels that never materialized. The share price in particular increased to a level that even the company's executives were hard-pressed to defend.  In response to this business growth, Sun expanded aggressively in all areas: head-count, infrastructure, and office space.

The bursting of the bubble in 2001 was the start of a period of poor business performance for Sun.<ref>[http://quotes.nasdaq.com/quote.dll?page=charting&mode=basics&intraday=off&timeframe=10y&charttype=ohlc&splits=off&earnings=off&movingaverage=None&lowerstudy=volume&comparison=off&index=&drilldown=off&symbol=SUNW&selected=SUNW NASDAQ]</ref> 
Sales dropped as the growth of online business failed to meet predictions.  As online businesses closed and their assets were auctioned off, a large amount of high-end Sun hardware was available very cheaply.  Much like [[Apple Computer|Apple]], Sun relied a great deal on [[hardware]] sales.

Multiple quarters of substantial losses and declining revenues have led to repeated rounds of layoffs,<ref>{{cite web|title=Sun to lay off 1,000 |url=http://news.com.com/Sun+to+lay+off+1,000/2100-1022_3-5078493.html|accessdate=2007-07-13|date=[[18 September]] [[2003]] |publisher=[[CNET|CNet News.com]]|first=Stephen|last=Shankland}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2007-07-13|date= [[24 June]] [[2005]] |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/24/sun_layoffs_2006/|title=Sun layoffs hit hundreds in US|first=Ashlee|last=Vance|publisher=[[The Register]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1009_22-6058894.html|date= [[7 April]] [[2006]] |accessdate=2007-07-13|title=Sun layoffs hit high-end server group|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|first=Stephen|last=Shankland}}</ref>
executive departures, and expense-reduction efforts.  In December 2001 the share price dropped to the 1998 pre-bubble level of about one hundred dollars or so and then kept going, a rapid fall even by the standards of the high-tech sector at that time. The stock dipped below 10 dollars a year later, one-tenth of its 1990 value, then quickly bounced back to 20, where it has hovered ever since.  In mid-2004, Sun ceased manufacturing operations at their [[Newark, California]] facility and consolidated all of the company's US-based manufacturing operations to their [[Hillsboro, Oregon]] facility, as part of continued cost-reduction efforts.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2004/01/12/daily49.html | date= [[16 January]] [[2004]] |accessdate=2007-07-14|title= Sun to add jobs in Hillsboro | publisher= [[Portland Business Journal]]}}</ref>
In 2006 Sun closed the Newark campus completely and moved 2,300 staff to its other campuses in the area.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sanjose.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2006/05/08/daily55.html | date= [[11 May]] [[2006]] | accessdate=2007-07-14 | title=Sun to sell Newark campus, move 2,300 workers |work= Silicon Valley, San Jose Business Journal}}</ref>

Many companies (like [[E-Trade]] and [[Google]]) chose to build Web applications based on large numbers of the less expensive PC-class x86-architecture servers running [[Linux]], rather than a smaller number of high-end Sun servers. They reported benefits including substantially lower expenses (both acquisition and maintenance) and greater flexibility based on the use of [[open source|open-source]] software.  That trend is slowing and may be reversing,{{Fact|date=July 2007}} given (1) the throughput and efficiency of Sun's new horizontally-scaled systems (see below) and (2) the fact that both Sun's flagship Solaris operating system and its UltraSPARC T1 processor are now fully open-source.

Higher level telecoms  control systems such as NMAS and [[Operational Support Systems|OSS]] service predominantly use Sun equipment.  This use is due mainly to the company basing its products around a mature and very stable version of the [[Unix]] operating system and the support service that Sun provides.

=== Present focus ===

In 2004, Sun canceled two major processor projects which emphasized high [[instruction level parallelism]] and  operating frequency. Instead, the company chose to concentrate on processors optimized for [[multi-threading]] and [[multiprocessing]], such as the [[UltraSPARC T1]] processor (codenamed "Niagara"). The company also announced a collaboration with [[Fujitsu]] to use the [[Japan]]ese company's processor chips in mid-range and high-end Sun servers. These servers were announced on [[17 April]] [[2007]] as the M-Series, part of the [[SPARC Enterprise]] series.

In February 2005, Sun announced the [[Sun Grid]], a [[grid computing]] deployment on which it  offers [[utility computing]] services priced at $1 (US) per CPU/hour for processing and per GB/month for storage. This offering builds upon an existing 3,000-CPU server farm used for internal R&D for over 10 years, of which Sun markets as being able to achieve 97% utilization. In August 2005, the first commercial use of this grid was announced for financial risk simulations which was later launched as its first [[Software as a Service]] product.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2005-08/sunflash.20050824.2.html | date= [[24 August]] [[2005]] | title = CDO2 Unlocks The Power of Sun Grid for Faster Financial Risk Simulation }}</ref>

In January 2005, Sun reported a net profit of $19 million for fiscal 2005 second quarter, for the first time in three years. This was followed by net loss of $9 million on [[GAAP]] basis for the third quarter 2005, as reported on [[April 14]] [[2005]]. In January 2007, Sun reported a net GAAP profit of $126 million on revenue of $3.337 billion for its fiscal second quarter.  Shortly following that news, it was announced that [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] (KKR) would invest $700 million in the company.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/01-23-2007/0004511496 | date= [[23 January]] [[2007]] | title = Sun Microsystems Welcomes Endorsement and Investment From KKR }}</ref>

In recent years Sun's engineering work has become international, with substantial groups in [[Bangalore]], [[Beijing]], [[Dublin]], [[Grenoble]], [[Hamburg]], [[Prague]], [[St. Petersburg]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Tokyo]], and [[Trondheim]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/9/37846828.pdf | title = "Offshoring Software Development presentation by Sun to the OECD"}}</ref>

== Hardware ==

For the first decade of Sun's history, the company was predominantly a vendor of technical [[workstations]], competing successfully as a low-cost vendor during the Workstation Wars of the 1980s.  It now has shifted its hardware product line to emphasize servers and storage.

===Motorola-based systems===

Sun originally used the Motorola [[68k]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] family for the [[Sun-1]] through [[Sun-3]] computer series. The Sun-1 employed a [[Motorola 68000|68000]] CPU, the [[Sun-2]] series, a [[Motorola 68010|68010]]. The Sun-3 series was based on the [[Motorola 68020|68020]], with the later Sun-3x variant using the [[Motorola 68030|68030]].

===SPARC-based systems===
{{see also|SPARC}}
[[Image:SPARCstation 1.jpg|right|thumb|SPARCstation 1+]]
In 1987, the company began using ''SPARC'', a processor architecture of its own design, in its computer systems, starting with the [[Sun-4]] line. SPARC was initially a [[32-bit]] architecture until the introduction of the SPARC V9 architecture in 1995, which added [[64-bit]] extensions.

Sun has developed several generations of SPARC-based computer systems, including the [[SPARCstation]], [[Sun Ultra series|Ultra]] and [[Sun Blade]] series of workstations, and the SPARCserver, [[Sun Netra|Netra]], [[Sun Enterprise|Enterprise]] and [[Sun Fire]] line of servers.

In the early 1990s the company began to extend its product line to include large-scale [[symmetric multiprocessing]] servers, starting with the four-processor SPARCserver 600MP. This was followed by the 8-processor SPARCserver 1000 and 20-processor SPARCcenter 2000, which were based on work done in conjunction with [[Xerox PARC]]. In the late 1990s this transformation was accelerated by the acquisition of [[Cray Research|Cray Business Systems Division]] from [[Silicon Graphics]].<ref name="Cray_BSD"/> Their 32-bit, 64-processor [[Cray CS6400|Cray Superserver 6400]], related to the SPARCcenter, led to the 64-bit [[Sun Enterprise 10000]] high-end server (otherwise known as ''Starfire'').  More recently, Sun has also ventured into the ''[[blade server]]'' (high density rack-mounted systems) market.

In November 2005 Sun launched the [[UltraSPARC T1]], notable for its ability to concurrently run 32 threads of execution on 8 processor cores.  Its intent was to drive more efficient use of CPU resources, which is of particular importance in [[data center]]s, where there is an increasing need to reduce power and air conditioning demands, much of which comes from the heat generated by CPUs. The T1 was followed by the [[UltraSPARC T2]], which extended the number of threads per core from 4 to 8, and T2 Plus, which added the ability to have multiple T2 processors in one system. Sun has open sourced the design specifications of both the T1 and T2 processors via the [[OpenSPARC]] project.

In April 2007, Sun released the [[SPARC Enterprise]] server products, jointly designed by Sun and [[Fujitsu]] and based on Fujitsu [[SPARC64]] processors. The ''M-class'' SPARC Enterprise systems include high-end reliability and availability features.

=== x86-based systems ===

In the late 1980s, Sun also marketed an [[Intel 80386]]-based machine, the [[Sun386i]]; this was designed to be a hybrid system, running SunOS but at the same time supporting DOS applications.  This only remained on the market for a brief period of time.  A follow-up "486i" upgrade was announced but only a few prototype units were ever manufactured.

Sun's brief first foray into x86 systems ended in the early 1990s, as it decided to concentrate on SPARC and retire the last Motorola systems and 386i products, a move dubbed by McNealy as "all the wood behind one arrowhead".  Even so, Sun kept its hand in the x86 world, as a release of Solaris for [[PC compatible]]s began shipping in 1993.

In 1997 Sun acquired [[Diba, Inc.]], followed later by the acquisition of [[Cobalt Networks]] in 2000, with the aim of building ''network appliances'' (single function computers meant for consumers). Sun also marketed a ''[[network computer]]'' (a term popularized and eventually trademarked by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]); the [[JavaStation]] was a diskless system designed to run Java applications.

Although none of these business initiatives were particularly successful, the Cobalt purchase gave Sun a toehold for its return to the x86 hardware market. In 2002, Sun introduced its first general purpose x86 system, the LX50, based in part on previous Cobalt system expertise.  This was also Sun's first system announced to support [[Linux]] as well as Solaris.

In 2003, Sun announced a strategic alliance with [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] to produce x86/x64 servers based on AMD's [[Opteron]] processor; this was followed shortly by Sun's acquisition of Kealia, a startup founded by original Sun founder Andy Bechtolsheim, which had been focusing on high-performance AMD-based servers.

The following year, Sun launched the Opteron-based Sun Fire V20z and V40z servers, and the [[Java Workstation]] W1100z and W2100z workstations.

On [[September 12]] [[2005]], Sun unveiled a new range of Opteron-based servers: the Sun Fire X2100, X4100 and X4200 servers.<ref>[http://www.sun.com/nc/05q3/videos/index.jsp?exec=3 Sun Microsystems<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  These were designed from scratch by the team led by Bechtolsheim to address heat and power consumption issues commonly faced in data centers. In July 2006, the [[Sun Fire X4500]] and X4600 systems were introduced, extending what is now a line of x64 systems that support not only Solaris, but Linux and [[Microsoft Windows]] as well.

On [[January 22]] [[2007]], Sun announced a broad strategic alliance with [[Intel]].<ref>{{cite press release

}}</ref> that its Operating System Research Center (OSRC) expanded its focus to include optimization to Sun's [[OpenSolaris]] and [[Sun xVM|xVM]] virtualization products for AMD based processors.

== Software ==
Although Sun was initially known as a hardware company, its software history began with its founding in 1982; co-founder [[Bill Joy]] was one of the leading [[Unix]] developers of the time, having already contributed the [[vi]] editor, the [[C shell]], and significant work on the [[TCP/IP]] stack to the [[BSD Unix]] OS.  Since then, Sun has developed and acquired other software, and become widely known for the [[Java programming language]].

Sun is known for community-based and open-source licensing of its major technologies, and for its support of its products with other open source technologies.  Sun offers [[GNOME]]-based desktop software called [[Java Desktop System]] (originally code-named "[[Madhatter]]"), first distributed as a Linux implementation but now offered as part of the Solaris operating system. It supports its [[Java Enterprise System]] (a middleware stack) on Linux. It has released the source code for Solaris under the [[open-source]] [[Common Development and Distribution License]], via the [[OpenSolaris]] community.  Sun's positioning includes a commitment to indemnify users of some software from intellectual property disputes concerning that software. It offers support services on a variety of pricing bases, including per-employee and per-socket.

A report prepared for the [[EU]] by [[UNU-MERIT]] stated that Sun is the largest corporate contributor to open source movements in the world.<ref name="MERIT-floss">{{cite web | title = Study on the: Economic impact of open source software on innovation and the competitiveness of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector in the EU | url = http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/ict/policy/doc/2006-11-20-flossimpact.pdf | accessdate = 2007-01-25 | author = Rishab Aiyer Ghosh | date = [[November 20]] [[2006]] | format = PDF | publisher = [[European Union]] | pages = p. 51 }}</ref> According to this report, Sun's open source contributions exceed the combined total of the next five largest commercial contributors.

=== Operating systems ===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Solaris10.jpg|thumb|250px|Solaris 10 using the [[Java Desktop System]]]] -->
{{main|Solaris Operating System}}

Sun is most well known for its [[Unix]] systems, which have a reputation for system stability and a consistent design philosophy.

Sun's first workstation shipped with [[UniSoft]] [[Version 7 Unix|V7 Unix]].  Later in 1982 Sun began providing [[SunOS]], a customized [[Berkeley Software Distribution|4.1BSD]] Unix, as the operating system for its workstations.

In the late 1980s, AT&T tapped Sun to help them develop the next release of their branded UNIX, and in 1988 announced they would purchase up to a 20% stake in Sun.<ref>{{cite news  | first = Burgess | last = John | title = AT&T to Buy Stake In Sun Microsystems | url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/406816581.html?dids=406816581:406816581&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=JAN+07%2C+1988&author=John+Burgess+Washington+Post+Staff+Writer&pub=The+Washington+Post | work = The Washington Post | date = [[January 7]] [[1988]] | accessdate = 2007-01-23 | quote = American Telephone & Telegraph Co. announced yesterday that it will buy up to a 20 percent stake in Sun Microsystems Inc., a Silicon Valley-based maker of powerful small computers known as workstations. }}</ref> UNIX [[System V Release 4]] (SVR4) was jointly developed by AT&T and Sun; this partnership triggered concern among Sun's competitors, many of whom banded together to form the [[Open Software Foundation]] (OSF).  By the mid-1990s, the ensuing [[Unix wars]] had largely subsided, AT&T had sold off their Unix interests, and the relationship between the two companies was significantly reduced.

Sun used SVR4 as the foundation for Solaris 2, which became the successor to SunOS.

From 1992 Sun also sold [[INTERACTIVE UNIX]], an operating system it acquired when it bought [[INTERACTIVE Systems Corporation]] from [[Eastman Kodak Company]]. This was a popular UNIX variant for the PC platform and a major competitor to market leader [[SCO UNIX]]. Sun's focus on INTERACTIVE UNIX diminished in favor of Solaris on both SPARC and x86 systems; it was dropped as a product in 2001.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

In the past, Sun has offered a separate variant of Solaris called [[Trusted Solaris]], which included augmented security features such as [[multilevel security]] and a [[least privilege]] access model.  Solaris 10 included many of the same capabilities as Trusted Solaris when it was released in 2005; the Solaris 10 11/06 update included Solaris Trusted Extensions, which give it the remaining capabilities needed to make it the functional successor to Trusted Solaris.

Following several years of difficult competition and loss of server market share to competitors' [[Linux]]-based systems, Sun began to include Linux as part of its strategy in 2002.  Sun supports both [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] and [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]] on its x64 systems; companies such as [[Canonical Ltd.]], [[Wind River Systems]] and [[MontaVista]] also support their versions of Linux on Sun's SPARC-based systems.

In 2004, Sun surprised the industry when, after having cultivated a reputation as one of [[Microsoft]]'s most vocal antagonists, it entered into a joint relationship with them, resolving various legal entanglements between the two companies and receiving US$1.95 billion in settlement payments from them.<ref>{{cite press release

=== Java platform ===

The [[Java platform]] was developed at Sun in the early 1990s with the objective of allowing programs to function regardless of the device they were used on, sparking the slogan "[[Write once, run anywhere]]" (WORA).  While this objective has not been entirely achieved (prompting the riposte "Write once, debug everywhere"), Java is regarded as being largely hardware- and operating system-independent.

Java was initially promoted as a platform for client-side [[Java applet|''applets'']] running inside web browsers. Early examples of Java applications were the [[HotJava]] [[web browser]] and the [[HotJava Views]] suite. However, since then Java has been more successful on the [[Server-side|server side]] of the Internet.

The platform consists of three major parts, the [[Java programming language]], the [[Java Virtual Machine]] (JVM), and several [[Java API|Java Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)]]. The design of the Java platform is controlled by the vendor and user community through the [[Java Community Process]] (JCP).

Java is an [[object-oriented programming]] language. Since its introduction in late 1995, it has become one of the world's most popular programming languages.<ref>{{cite web
 |url = http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm
 |title = TIOBE Programming Community Index
 |accessdate = 2007-07-05
 |year = 2007
 |month = 6
 |publisher = TIOBE Software
}} Java is ranked 1st as of June 2007, and has ranked 1st or 2nd in this index since its inception in 2001.</ref>

In order to allow programs written in the Java language to be run on virtually any device, Java programs are compiled to [[byte code]], which can be executed by any JVM, regardless of the environment.

The Java [[Application programming interface|API]]s provide an extensive set of library routines. These APIs have evolved into the [[Java SE|''Standard Edition'' (Java SE)]], which provides basic infrastructure and GUI functionality; the [[Java EE|''Enterprise Edition'' (Java EE)]], aimed at large software companies implementing enterprise-class application servers; and the [[Java ME|''Micro Edition'' (Java ME)]], used to build software for devices with limited resources, such as mobile devices.

On [[November 13]] [[2006]], Sun announced that it would be licensing its Java implementation under the [[GNU General Public License]]; they released their [[Java compiler]] and JVM at that time.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sun.com/2006-1113/feature/story.jsp | title = Sun Opens Java | accessdate = 2007-01-25 | date= [[13 November]] [[2006]] |  work = Sun Microsystems Web site }}</ref>

===Office suite===

In 1999, Sun acquired the German software company StarDivision and with it [[StarOffice]], which it released as the [[office suite]] [[OpenOffice.org]] under both [[GNU LGPL]] and the SISSL ([[Sun Industry Standards Source License]]). OpenOffice.org supports [[Microsoft Office]] file formats (with a few flaws){{Fact|date=October 2008}}, is available on many platforms (primarily [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]) and is widely used in the [[open source community]].

The current StarOffice product is a closed-source product based on OpenOffice.org.  The principal differences between StarOffice and OpenOffice.org are that StarOffice is supported by Sun, is available as either a single-user retail box kit or as per-user blocks of licensing for the enterprise, and includes a wider range of fonts and document templates and a commercial quality spellchecker<ref>{{cite web|title=Product Comparison|url=http://www.sun.com/software/star/openoffice/|work=Sun Microsystems|accessdate=2008-09-18}}</ref>.  StarOffice also contains commercially licensed functions and add-ons; in OpenOffice.org these are either replaced by open-source or free variants, or are not present at all. Both packages have native support for the [[OpenDocument]] format.

===Virtualization and datacenter automation software===
[[Image:VirtualBox.png|thumb|300px|[[VirtualBox]], now owned by Sun Microsystems]]
In 2007, Sun announced the [[Sun xVM]] virtualization and datacenter automation product suite for commodity hardware. Sun also acquired [[VirtualBox]] in 2008. Earlier virtualization technologies from Sun like ''Dynamic System Domains'' and ''Dynamic Reconfiguration'' were specifically designed for high-end SPARC servers, and [[Logical Domains]] only supports the UltraSPARC T1/T2/T2 Plus server platforms. Sun also has the ''N1'' provisioning software <ref>[http://www.sun.com/software/n1/ Systems Management<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> for datacenter automation.

On the client side, Sun offers [[virtual desktop]] solutions. Complete desktop environments and applications can be hosted in the datacenter, with users accessing these environments from a wide range of client devices, including [[Microsoft Windows]] PCs, [[Sun Ray|Sun Ray virtual display clients]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Macintoshes, PDAs or any combination of supported devices. A variety of networks are supported, from LAN to WAN or the public Internet. A virtual desktop solution can be provided through  [[SRSS|Sun Ray Software]], [[Sun Secure Global Desktop]] and [[SVDI|Sun Virtual Desktop Infrastructure]].

===Database management systems===

Sun acquired [[MySQL AB]], the developer of the [[MySQL]] database in 2008. CEO [[Jonathan Schwartz]] mentioned in his blog that optimizing the performance of MySQL is one of the priorities of the acquisition. <ref>{{cite web

}} </ref> Sun is also a contributor to the [[PostgreSQL]] project. On the Java platform, Sun contributes to, ships, and offers support for [[JavaDB]].

===Other software===

Sun offers a range of other software products for software development and infrastructure services.  Many of these products were developed in house; others have come from a series of acquisitions, including [[Tarantella, Inc.|Tarantella]], Waveset Technologies,<ref name="waveset"/>, [[SeeBeyond]], and [[Vaau, Inc.|Vaau]]. Sun also acquired many of the [[Netscape]] non-browser software products as part a deal involving Netscape's merger with [[AOL]].<ref>{{cite press release |title= SUN-NETSCAPE ALLIANCE TARGETS E-COMMERCE WITH NEW BRAND IDENTITY |publisher= Sun Microsystems |date= [[January 25]] [[2000]] | url= http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2000-01/sunflash.20000125.5.xml |accessdate= 2007-01-01 }}</ref>. These software products were initially offered under the ''[[iPlanet]]'' brand; once the Sun-Netscape alliance ended, they were re-branded as ''[[Sun ONE]]'' (Sun Open Network Environment), and more recently as the ''[[Sun Java System]]''.

Today, Sun's [[middleware]] [[solution stack|stack]] is branded as the ''Java Enterprise System'' (or JES), and fulfills web and application serving, as well as communication, calendaring, directory, identity management and [[service-oriented architecture|SOA/business integration]] roles. The software is available for download and use free of charge on systems running Solaris, [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]], [[HP-UX]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], with support available optionally.

Sun has developed data center management software products, which include the ''[[Solaris Cluster]]'' high availability software, and a [[grid computing|grid]] management package called ''[[Sun Grid Engine]]''.

Sun also produces a suite of compilers and development tools under the ''[[Sun Studio (software)|Sun Studio]]'' brand, for building and developing Solaris and Linux applications.

== Storage ==

Sun has long sold its own storage systems to complement its system offerings; it has also made several storage-related acquisitions.
On [[June 2]] [[2005]], Sun announced it would purchase [[Storage Technology Corporation]] (StorageTek) for US$4.1 billion in cash, or $37.00 per share, a deal completed in August 2005.

In 2006, Sun introduced the [[Sun StorageTek 5800 System]], the world's first application-aware programmable storage solution. In 2008, Sun contributed the source code of the StorageTek 5800 System under the BSD license. <ref>{{cite web

}} </ref>

Sun announced the [[Sun Open Storage]] platform in 2008. Built with open and open source technologies, Sun hopes to remove [[vendor lock-in]] in the storage market.

Other well-known storage products include [[Sun Fire X4500]] storage server and SAM-[[QFS]] filesystem and storage management software.

== HPC solutions ==

With [[Sun Constellation System]], Sun is increasing its focus in [[High-Performance Computing]] (HPC). Even before the introduction of the Sun Constellation System in 2007, Sun's products were already in use in many of the [[TOP500]] systems and supercomputing centers:

* [[Lustre (file system)|Lustre]] - used by 7 of the top 10 supercomputers in 2008, as well as other industries that need scalable and high-performance storage: 6 major oil companies (including [[BP]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], and [[ExxonMobil]]), chip-design (including [[Synopsys]] and [[Sony]]), and the movie-industry (including [[Harry Potter film series|Harry Potter]] and [[Spider-Man]]).<ref>{{cite web

* [[Sun Fire X4500]] - used by high energy physics supercomputers to run dCache
* [[Sun Grid Engine]] - a popular workload scheduler for clusters and compute farms
* [[Sun Visualization System]] - allows users of the [[TeraGrid]] to remotely access the 3D rendering capabilities of the ''Maverick'' system at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]
* [[Sun Modular Datacenter]] (Project Blackbox) - two Sun MD S20 units are used by the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]]

The ''Sun HPC ClusterTools'' product is a set of [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] libraries and tools for running parallel jobs on Solaris HPC clusters. Beginning with version 7.0, Sun switched from its own implementation of MPI to [[Open MPI]], and has started donating engineering resources to the Open MPI project.

Sun is a participant in the [[OpenMP]] language committee. [[Sun Studio (software)|Sun Studio]] compilers and tools natively implement the OpenMP specification for shared memory parallelization.

In 2006, Sun built the ''TSUBAME supercomputer'', which was until [[June 2008]] the fastest supercomputer in Asia. Sun built ''Ranger'' at the [[Texas Advanced Computing Center]] (TACC) in 2007. Ranger has a peak performance of over 500 TFLOPS, and is currently the 4th most powerful supercomputer on the [[TOP500]] list.

Sun also has an [[OpenSolaris]] distribution that is optimized for HPC workloads. The distribution integrates many of Sun's HPC products and other commonly used 3rd-party solutions. <ref>{{cite web
