'''''Edmontosaurus''''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+025B>|d|<U+02CC>|m|<U+0252>|n|t|<U+0275>|<U+02C8>|s|<U+0254>r|<U+0259>|s}} {{respell|ed|MON|toh|SAWR|<U+0259>s}}) is a [[genus]] of crestless [[hadrosaurid]] (duck-billed) [[dinosaur]]. It contains two [[species]]: '''''Edmontosaurus regalis''''' and ''[[Edmontosaurus annectens]]''. [[Fossil]]s of ''E. regalis'' have been found in rocks of western North America that date from the late [[Campanian]] [[Stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] of the [[Cretaceous]] [[Geologic time scale#Terminology|Period]] 73 million years ago, while those of ''E. annectens'' were found in the same geographic region but in rocks dated to the end of the [[Maastrichtian]] stage of the Cretaceous, 65.5&nbsp;million years ago. ''E. annectens'' was one of the last non-[[bird|avian]] dinosaurs, and lived alongside ''[[Triceratops horridus]]'' and ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' shortly before the [[Cretaceous<U+2013>Paleogene extinction event]].

''Edmontosaurus'' included some of the largest hadrosaurid species, measuring up to {{convert|13|m|ft|sp=us}} long and weighing around {{convert|4.0|MT|ST}}. Several well-preserved specimens are known that include not only bones, but in some cases extensive skin impressions and possible gut contents. It is classified as a genus of [[Saurolophinae|saurolophine]] (or [[Hadrosaurinae|hadrosaurine]]) hadrosaurid, a member of the group of hadrosaurids which lacked hollow crests.

''Edmontosaurus'' has a lengthy and complicated [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] history dating to the late 19th century. Specimens of ''Edmontosaurus'' have been classified with various genera including '''''Anatosaurus''''', '''''Anatotitan''''', ''[[Claosaurus]]'', ''[[Diclonius]]'', ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'', ''[[Thespesius]]'', and ''[[Trachodon]]'', and the well-known but possibly synonymous ''Anatosaurus'' and ''Anatotitan'' are now generally regarded as synonyms of ''Edmontosaurus''. The first fossils named ''Edmontosaurus'' were discovered in southern [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], in the [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]] (formerly called the lower Edmonton Formation). The [[type species]], ''E. regalis'', was named by [[Lawrence Lambe]] in 1917, although several other species that are now classified in ''Edmontosaurus'' were named earlier.  The best known of these is ''E. annectens'', originally named by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] in 1892 as ''[[Claosaurus]] annectens'' and known for many years as ''Anatosaurus annectens''.

''Edmontosaurus'' was widely distributed across western North America.  The distribution of ''Edmontosaurus'' fossils suggests that it preferred coasts and [[coastal plain]]s.  It was a [[herbivory|herbivore]] that could move on both two legs and four.  Because it is known from several [[bone bed]]s, ''Edmontosaurus'' is thought to have lived in groups, and may have been migratory as well.  The wealth of fossils has allowed researchers to study its [[paleobiology]] in detail, including its brain, how it may have fed, and its injuries and [[pathology|pathologies]], such as evidence for a tyrannosaur attack on one edmontosaur specimen.

===Postcranial skeleton===
[[File:Edmontosaurus pelvis left.jpg|thumb|Hip bones of ''Edmontosaurus'', an [[ornithischia]]n dinosaur.]]
The number of [[vertebra]]e differs between specimens.  ''E. regalis'' had thirteen neck vertebrae, eighteen back vertebrae, nine hip vertebrae, and an unknown number of tail vertebrae.<ref name=LW42c/>  A specimen once identified as belonging to ''Anatosaurus edmontoni'' (now considered to be the same as ''E. regalis'') is reported as having an additional back vertebra and 85&nbsp;tail vertebrae, with an undisclosed amount of restoration.<ref name=LW42c/> Other hadrosaurids are only reported as having 50 to 70&nbsp;tail vertebrae,<ref name=HWF04/> so this appears to have been an overestimate. The [[anatomical terms of location|anterior]] back was curved toward the ground, with the neck flexed upward and the rest of the back and tail held horizontally.<ref name=HWF04/> Most of the back and tail were lined by [[ossification|ossified]] [[tendon]]s arranged in a [[latticework]] along the [[spinous process|neural spines]] of the vertebrae.  This condition has been described as making the back and at least part of the tail "ramrod" straight.<ref name=JHO64>{{cite journal |doi=10.2475/ajs.262.8.975 |last=Ostrom |first=John H. |year=1964 |authorlink=John Ostrom |title=A reconsideration of the paleoecology of the hadrosaurian dinosaurs |journal=American Journal of Science |volume=262 |pages=975<U+2013>997 |issue=8}}</ref><ref name=PMG70>{{cite journal |last=Galton |first=Peter M. |authorlink=Peter Galton |year=1970 |title=The posture of hadrosaurian dinosaurs |journal=Journal of Paleontology |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=464<U+2013>473}}</ref> The ossified tendons are interpreted as having strengthened the vertebral column against gravitational stress, incurred through being a large animal with a horizontal vertebral column otherwise supported mostly by the hind legs and hips.<ref name=JHO64/>

The [[scapula|shoulder blades]] were long flat blade-like bones, held roughly parallel to the vertebral column. The [[pelvis|hips]] were composed of three elements each: an elongate [[ilium (bone)|ilium]] above the articulation with the leg, an [[ischium]] below and behind with a long thin rod, and a [[pubis (bone)|pubis]] in front that flared into a plate-like structure.  The structure of the hip hindered the animal from standing with its back erect, because in such a position the [[femur|thigh bone]] would have pushed against the joint of the ilium and pubis, instead of pushing only against the solid ilium.  The nine fused hip vertebrae provided support for the hip.<ref name=LW42a/>

The fore legs were shorter and less heavily built than the hind legs.  The [[humerus|upper arm]] had a large deltopectoral crest for muscle attachment, while the [[ulna]] and [[radius (bone)|radius]] were slim.  The upper arm and forearm were similar in length.  The [[carpus|wrist]] was simple, with only two small bones.  Each hand had four fingers, with no thumb (first finger).  The index second, third, and fourth fingers were approximately the same length and were united in life within a fleshy covering.  Although the second and third finger had hoof-like [[ungual]]s, these bones were also within the skin and not apparent from the outside.  The little finger diverged from the other three and was much shorter. The thigh bone was robust and straight, with a prominent [[fourth trochanter|flange]] about halfway down the [[anatomical terms of location|posterior]] side.<ref name=LW42a/> This ridge was for the attachment of powerful muscles attached to the hips and tail that pulled the thighs (and thus the hind legs) backward and helped maintain the use of the tail as a balancing organ.<ref name=LW42e2>Lull, Richard Swann; and Wright, Nelda E. (1942). ''Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America''. pp. 98<U+2013>110.</ref>  Each foot had three toes, with no big toe or little toe.  The toes had hoof-like tips.<ref name=LW42a/>

[[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]]&nbsp;5060, the "Trachodon mummy" (so-called because it appears to be a fossil of a [[Mummy#Natural mummies|natural mummy]]), is now recognized as a specimen of ''E. annectens''.  It was found to have skin impressions over the snout, much of the neck and torso, and parts of the arms and legs.<ref name=LW42d/> The tail and part of the legs eroded before collection, so these areas are unknown for the specimen.<ref name=HFO12/> Additionally, some areas with skin impressions, such as sections associated with the neck ridge (see below) and hands, were accidentally removed during preparation of the specimen.<ref name=HFO09/> The specimen is thought to have desiccated in a dry stream bed,<ref name=HFO12/> probably on or near a [[point bar]].

The [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] was thin, and the scalation composed of small nonoverlapping scales,<ref name=HFO09/> as seen in the [[Gila monster]].<ref name=LW42d/>  Two general types of scales were present over most of the body: small pointed or convex [[tubercle]]s, {{convert|1|to|3|mm|in|sp=us}} in diameter with no definite arrangement (ground tubercles); and larger, flat [[polygon]]al tubercles (pavement tubercles) typically less than {{convert|5|mm|in|sp=us}} in diameter, but up to {{convert|10|mm|in|sp=us}} over the forearm.  The pavement tubercles were grouped into clusters separated by ground tubercles, with transitional scales between the two types.  Over most of the body, the pavement tubercles were arranged in circular or oval clusters, while near the shoulder on the upper arm, they formed strips roughly parallel to each other and the shoulder blade.  Generally, clusters were larger on the upper surfaces of the body and smaller on the underside.  Clusters up to {{convert|50|cm|in|sp=us}} in length were present above the hips.<ref name=HFO12/>
[[File:Edmontosaurus mummy.jpg|thumb|Recent picture of the AMNH mummy]]
The only impressions from the head came from the large opening for the nostrils.  Instead of tubercle impressions, there were impressions of folded soft tissue, with a deeper area at the anterior end of the opening that may have been the approximate location of the nostril itself.<ref name=LW42d/> The neck and back had a soft ridge or frill running down the midline, with a row of oval tubercle clusters arranged above the spines of the vertebrae.  The total height of the ridge on AMNH&nbsp;5060 is not known, nor the disposition of its upper border, as the upper extremity was prepared away. The ridge was at least {{convert|8|cm|in|sp=us}} tall, and was folded and creased to permit movement.  Osborn proposed that it was tall enough for another row of clusters.<ref name=HFO12/>

The forearms had the largest tubercles, arranged in single large clusters that covered the leading surfaces.  The hands were covered in small pavement tubercles in a soft-tissue structure than enclosed the three central fingers; not even the tips were exposed.  Osborn interpreted this as a paddle for swimming.<ref name=HFO12/> [[Robert T. Bakker]] later reinterpreted it as a soft-tissue pad for walking, analogous to that of a camel.<ref name=RTB86>{{cite book |last=Bakker |first=Robert T. |authorlink=Robert T.

The scalation of the rest of the leg is not presently known, although impressions on a specimen of the crested hadrosaurid ''[[Lambeosaurus]]'' suggest that the thighs were under the skin of the body, like modern birds.<ref name=LW42d/>

The tail of AMNH&nbsp;5060 was not present, but other specimens have filled in some details for that area.  Skin impressions from a partial tail belonging to ''Edmontosaurus annectens'', recovered from the [[Hell Creek Formation]] of [[Montana]], show a segmented ridge above the vertebrae.

''Edmontosaurus'' was a [[hadrosaurid]] (a duck-billed dinosaur), a member of a [[family (biology)|family]] of dinosaurs which to date are known only from the [[Late Cretaceous]]. It is classified within the [[Saurolophinae]] (alternately Hadrosaurinae), a [[clade]] of hadrosaurids which lacked hollow crests. Other members of the group include ''[[Brachylophosaurus]]'', ''[[Gryposaurus]]'', ''[[Lophorhothon]]'', ''[[Maiasaura]]'', ''[[Naashoibitosaurus]]'', ''[[Prosaurolophus]]'', and ''[[Saurolophus]]''.<ref name=HWF04/> It was either closely related to<ref name=WH90>{{cite book |last=Weishampel |first=David B. |authorlink=David B.

The giant [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] hadrosaurine ''[[Shantungosaurus giganteus]]'' is also anatomically similar to ''Edmontosaurus''; M. K. Brett-Surman found the two to differ only in details related to the greater size of ''Shantungosaurus'', based on what had been described of the latter genus.<ref name=MKBS89>{{cite book |last=Brett-Surman |first=Michael K. |year=1989 |title=A revision of the Hadrosauridae (Reptilia: Ornithischia) and their evolution during the Campanian and Maastrichtian |series=Ph.D. dissertation |publisher=George Washington University |location=Washington, D.C. }}</ref>

While the status of ''Edmontosaurus'' as a saurolophine or (="hadrosaurine") has not been challenged, its exact placement within the clade is uncertain.  Early [[phylogenetics|phylogenies]], such as that presented in [[R. S. Lull]] and Nelda Wright's influential 1942 [[monograph]], had ''Edmontosaurus'' and various species of ''Anatosaurus'' (most of which would be later considered as additional species or specimens of ''Edmontosaurus'') as one lineage among several lineages of "flat-headed" hadrosaurs.<ref name=LW42f>Lull, Richard Swann; and Wright, Nelda E.

==Discovery and history==
===''Claosaurus annectens'' and other early finds===
''Edmontosaurus'' has had a long and complicated history in paleontology, having spent decades with various species classified in other genera.  Its [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] history intertwines at various points with the genera ''[[Agathaumas]]'', ''Anatosaurus'', ''Anatotitan'', ''[[Claosaurus]]'', ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'', ''[[Thespesius]]'', and ''[[Trachodon]]'',<ref name=HWF04/><ref name=BSC07>{{cite book |last=Creisler |first=Benjamin S. |year=2007 |chapter=Deciphering duckbills: a history in nomenclature |editor=Carpenter, Kenneth (ed.) |title=Horns and Beaks: Ceratopsian and Ornithopod Dinosaurs |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington and Indianapolis |pages=185<U+2013>210 |isbn=0-253-34817-X}}</ref> and references predating the 1980s typically use ''Anatosaurus'', ''Claosaurus'', ''Thespesius'', or ''Trachodon'' for edmontosaur fossils (excluding those assigned to ''E. regalis''), depending on author and date.  Although ''Edmontosaurus'' was only named in 1917, its oldest well-supported species (''E. annectens'') was named in 1892 as a species of ''Claosaurus'', and scrappier fossils that may belong to it were described as long ago as 1871.<ref name=HWF04/>

The first described remains that may belong to ''Edmontosaurus'' were named ''Trachodon atavus'' in 1871 by [[Edward Drinker Cope]].<ref name=EDC71>{{cite journal |last=Cope |first=Edward Drinker |authorlink=Edward Drinker Cope |year=1871 |title=Supplement to the synopsis of the extinct Batrachia and Reptilia of North America |journal=American Philosophical Society, Proceedings |volume=12 |issue=86 |pages=41<U+2013>52}}</ref> This species was assessed without comment as a synonym of ''Edmontosaurus regalis'' in two reviews,<ref name=HWF04/><ref name=WH90/> although ''atavus'' predates ''regalis'' by several decades.

Neither species has attracted much attention; both are absent from Lull and Wright's 1942 monograph, for example.

The first well-supported species of ''Edmontosaurus'' was named in 1892 as ''Claosaurus annectens'' by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]].  This species is [[holotype|based on]] [[National Museum of Natural History|USNM]]&nbsp;2414, a partial skull-roof and skeleton, with a second skull and skeleton, [[Peabody Museum of Natural History|YPM]]&nbsp;2182, designated the [[paratype]]. Both were collected in 1891 by [[John Bell Hatcher]] from the late Maastrichtian-age Upper Cretaceous [[Lance Formation]] of [[Niobrara County, Wyoming|Niobrara County]] (then part of [[Converse County, Wyoming|Converse County]]), [[Wyoming]].<ref name=OCM92a>{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Othniel Charles |authorlink=Othniel Charles Marsh |year=1892 |title=Notice of new reptiles from the Laramie Formation |journal=American Journal of Science |volume=43 |pages=449<U+2013>453}}</ref> This species has some historical footnotes attached: it is among the first dinosaurs to receive a skeletal restoration, and is the first hadrosaurid so restored;<ref name=BSC07/><ref name=OCM92b>{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Othniel Charles |authorlink=Othniel Charles Marsh |year=1892 |title=Restorations of ''Claosaurus'' and ''Ceratosaurus'' |journal=American Journal of Science |volume=44 |pages=343<U+2013>349}}</ref> and YPM&nbsp;2182 and UNSM&nbsp;2414 are, respectively, the first and second essentially complete mounted dinosaur skeletons in the United States.<ref name=FAL04/> YPM&nbsp;2182 was put on display in 1901,<ref name=BSC07/> and USNM&nbsp;2414 in 1904.<ref name=FAL04/>

Because of the incomplete understanding of hadrosaurids at the time, following Marsh's death in 1897 ''Claosaurus annectens'' was variously classified as a species of ''Claosaurus'', ''Thespesius'' or ''Trachodon''. Opinions varied greatly; textbooks and encyclopedias drew a distinction between the "''[[Iguanodon]]''-like" ''Claosaurus annectens'' and the "duck-billed" ''Hadrosaurus'' (based on remains now known as adult ''Edmontosaurus annectens''), while Hatcher explicitly identified ''C. annectens'' as synonymous with the hadrosaurid represented by those same duck-billed skulls.<ref name=BSC07/> Hatcher's revision, published in 1902, was sweeping: he considered almost all hadrosaurid genera then known as synonyms of ''Trachodon''.  This included ''[[Cionodon]]'', ''[[Diclonius]]'', ''Hadrosaurus'', ''[[Hadrosaurus|Ornithotarsus]]'', ''[[Pteropelyx]]'', and ''Thespesius'', as well as ''[[Claorhynchus]]'' and ''[[Polyonax]]'', fragmentary genera now thought to be [[ceratopsia|horned dinosaurs]].<ref name=JBH02>{{cite journal |last=Hatcher |first=John B. |authorlink=John Bell Hatcher |year=1902 |title=The genus and species of the Trachodontidae (Hadrosauridae, Claosauridae) Marsh |journal=Annals of the Carnegie Museum|issue= 14 |volume=1 |pages=377<U+2013>386}}</ref> Hatcher's work led to a brief consensus, until after 1910 new material from Canada and Montana showed a greater diversity of hadrosaurids than previously suspected.<ref name=BSC07/> [[Charles W. Gilmore]] in 1915 reassessed hadrosaurids and recommended that ''Thespesius'' be reintroduced for hadrosaurids from the Lance Formation and rock units of equivalent age, and that ''Trachodon'', based on inadequate material, should be restricted to a hadrosaurid from the older [[Judith River Formation]] and its equivalents. In regards to ''Claosaurus annectens'', he recommended that it be considered the same as ''Thespesius occidentalis''.<ref name=CWG15>{{cite journal |last=Gilmore |first=Charles W. |authorlink=Charles W.

During this time frame (1902<U+2013>1915), two additional important specimens of ''C. annectens'' were recovered. The first, the "Trachodon mummy" (AMNH&nbsp;5060), was discovered in 1908 by [[Charles Hazelius Sternberg]] and his sons in Lance Formation rocks near [[Lusk, Wyoming|Lusk]], Wyoming.  Sternberg was working for the [[Natural History Museum|British Museum of Natural History]], but Henry Fairfield Osborn of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] was able to purchase the specimen for $2,000.<ref name=NGD95>{{cite book |last=Norell |first=M.

It was discovered in 1912 by Levi Sternberg. The second specimen, paratype NMC&nbsp;2289, consists of a skull and skeleton lacking the beak, most of the tail, and part of the feet.  It was discovered in 1916 by [[George F. Sternberg]]. Lambe found that his new dinosaur compared best to ''Diclonius mirabilis'' (specimens now assigned to ''Edmontosaurus annectens''), and drew attention to the size and robustness of ''Edmontosaurus''.<ref name=LML17/> Initially, Lambe only described the skulls of the two skeletons, but returned to the genus in 1920 to describe the skeleton of NMC&nbsp;2289.<ref name=LML20/> The [[postcrania]] of the type specimen remains undescribed, still in its plaster jackets.<ref name=DFG97/>
[[File:Edmontosaurus annectens specimen.jpg|thumb|Specimen CMNFV 8399, holotype of ''E. edmontoni'', now thought to be a young ''E. regalis'']]
Two more species that would come to be included with ''Edmontosaurus'' were named from Canadian remains in the 1920s, but both would initially be assigned to ''Thespesius''. Gilmore named the first, ''Thespesius edmontoni'', in 1924. ''T. edmontoni'' also came from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. It was based on NMC&nbsp;8399, another nearly complete skeleton lacking most of the tail.  NMC&nbsp;8399 was discovered on the Red Deer River in 1912 by a Sternberg party.<ref name=CWG24/>  Its forelimbs, ossified tendons, and skin impressions were briefly described in 1913 and 1914 by Lambe, who at first thought it was an example of a species he'd named ''Trachodon marginatus'',<ref name=LML13>{{cite journal |last=Lambe |first=Lawrence M. |authorlink=Lawrence Lambe |year=1913 |title=The manus in a specimen of ''Trachodon'' from the Edmonton Formation of Alberta |journal=The Ottawa Naturalist |volume=27 |pages=21<U+2013>25}}</ref> but then changed his mind.<ref name=LML14>{{cite journal |last=Lambe |first=Lawrence M. |authorlink=Lawrence Lambe |year=1914 |title=On the fore-limb of a carnivorous dinosaur from the Belly River Formation of Alberta, and a new genus of Ceratopsia from the same horizon, with remarks on the integument of some Cretaceous herbivorous dinosaurs |journal=The Ottawa Naturalist |volume=27 |pages=129<U+2013>135}}</ref> The specimen became the first dinosaur skeleton to be mounted for exhibition in a Canadian museum.  Gilmore found that his new species compared closely to what he called ''Thespesius annectens'', but left the two apart because of details of the arms and hands.  He also noted that his species had more vertebrae than Marsh's in the back and neck, but proposed that Marsh was mistaken in assuming that the ''annectens'' specimens were complete in those regions.<ref name=CWG24/>

In 1926, [[Charles Mortram Sternberg]] named ''Thespesius saskatchewanensis'' for NMC&nbsp;8509, a skull and partial skeleton from the Wood Mountain plateau of southern [[Saskatchewan]].  He had collected this specimen in 1921, from rocks that were assigned to the Lance Formation,<ref name=CMS26/> now the [[Frenchman Formation]].<ref name=HWF04/> NMC&nbsp;8509 included an almost complete skull, numerous vertebrae, partial shoulder and hip girdles, and partial hind limbs, representing the first substantial dinosaur specimen recovered from Saskatchewan. Sternberg opted to assign it to ''Thespesius'' because that was the only hadrosaurid genus known from the Lance Formation at the time.<ref name=CMS26/> At the time, ''T. saskatchewanensis'' was unusual because of its small size, estimated at {{convert|7|to|7.3|m|ft|sp=us}} in length.<ref name=LW42c/>

===''Anatosaurus'' to the present===
In 1942, Lull and Wright attempted to resolve the complicated taxonomy of crestless hadrosaurids by naming a new genus, ''Anatosaurus'', to take in several species that did not fit well under their previous genera. ''Anatosaurus'', meaning "duck lizard", because of its wide, duck-like beak ([[Latin]] ''anas'' = duck + [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''sauros'' = lizard), had as its type species Marsh's old ''Claosaurus annectens''.  Also assigned to this genus were ''Thespesius edmontoni'', ''T. saskatchewanensis'', a large lower jaw that Marsh had named ''Trachodon longiceps'' in 1890, and a new species, ''Anatosaurus copei'', for two skeletons on display at the American Museum of Natural History that had long been known as ''Diclonius mirabilis'' (or variations thereof). Thus, the various species became ''Anatosaurus annectens'', ''A. copei'', ''A. edmontoni'', ''A. longiceps'', and ''A. saskatchewanensis''.<ref name=LW42c/>  ''Anatosaurus'' would come to be called the "classic duck-billed dinosaur."<ref name=DFG82>{{cite book |last=Glut |first=Donald F. |title=The New Dinosaur Dictionary |year=1982 |publisher=Citadel Press |location=Secaucus, NJ |isbn=0-8065-0782-9 |page=57 }}</ref>
[[Image:Dakota skin impression.jpg|thumb|left|Skin impression of the specimen nicknamed "Dakota", which was found in 1999]] 
This state of affairs persisted for several decades, until Michael K. Brett-Surman reexamined the pertinent material for his graduate studies in the 1970s and 1980s.  He concluded that the type species of ''Anatosaurus'', ''A. annectens'', was actually a species of ''Edmontosaurus'' and that ''A. copei'' was different enough to warrant its own genus.<ref name=MKBS89/><ref name=MKBS75>{{cite book |last=Brett-Surman |first=Michael K. |year=1975 |title=The appendicular anatomy of hadrosaurian dinosaurs |series=M.A. thesis |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley}}</ref><ref name=MKBS79>{{cite journal |last=Brett-Surman |first=Michael K. |year=1979 |title=Phylogeny and paleobiogeography of hadrosaurian dinosaurs |journal=Nature |volume=277 |issue=5697 |pages=560<U+2013>562 |doi=10.1038/277560a0}}</ref> Although theses and [[dissertation]]s are not regarded as official publications by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]], which regulates the naming of organisms, his conclusions were known to other paleontologists, and were adopted by several popular works of the time.<ref name=DFG82b>{{cite book |last=Glut |first=Donald F. |title=The New Dinosaur Dictionary |year=1982 |publisher=Citadel Press |location=Secaucus, NJ |isbn=0-8065-0782-9 |pages=49, 53}}</ref><ref name=DL83>{{cite book |last=Lambert |first=David |coauthors=and the Diagram Group |title=A Field Guide to Dinosaurs |year=1983 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=0-380-83519-3 |pages=156<U+2013>161}}</ref> Brett-Surman and Ralph Chapman designated a new genus for ''A. copei'' (''Anatotitan'') in 1990.<ref name=RCMBS90>{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Ralph E. |coauthors=and Brett-Surman, Michael K. |year=1990 |chapter=Morphometric observations on hadrosaurid ornithopods |editors=Carpenter, Kenneth, and Currie, Philip J.

The conception of ''Edmontosaurus'' that emerged included three valid species: the type ''E. regalis'', ''E. annectens'' (including ''Anatosaurus edmontoni'', emended to ''edmontonensis''), and ''E. saskatchewanensis''.<ref name=WH90/> The debate about the proper taxonomy of the ''A. copei'' specimens continues to the present: returning to Hatcher's argument of 1902, Jack Horner, [[David B. Weishampel]], and Catherine Forster regarded ''Anatotitan copei'' as representing specimens of ''Edmontosaurus annectens'' with crushed skulls.<ref name=HWF04/>  In 2007 another "mummy" was announced; nicknamed "[[Dakota (fossil)|Dakota]]", it was discovered in 1999 by [[Tyler Lyson]], and came from the [[Hell Creek Formation]] of [[North Dakota]].<ref name="ng"/><ref name="wp"/>

In a 2011 study by Nicol<U+00E1>s Campione and David Evans, the authors conducted the first ever morphometric analysis to compare the various specimens assigned to ''Edmontosaurus''. They concluded that only two species are valid: ''E. regalis'', from the late Campanian, and ''E. annectens'', from the late Maastrichtian. Their study provided further evidence that ''Anatotitan copei'' is a synonym of ''E. annectens''; specifically, that the long, low skull of ''A. copei'' is the result of ontogenetic change and represent mature ''E. annectens'' individuals.<ref name=NCDE11>Campione, N.E. and Evans, D.C.

''Edmontosaurus'' is currently regarded as having two valid species: type species ''E. regalis'', and ''E. annectens''.<ref name=HWF04/><ref name=NCDE11/> ''E. regalis'' is known only from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, dating from the late Campanian stage of the late Cretaceous period. At least a dozen individuals are known,<ref name=NCDE11/>  including seven skulls with associated postcrania, and five to seven other skulls.<ref name=HWF04/><ref name=WH90/> The species formerly known as ''Thespesius edmontoni'' or ''Anatosaurus edmontoni'' represents immature individuals.<ref name=NCDE11/><ref name=JAH75/><ref name=campione2009>Campione, N.E.

''E. annectens'' is known from the Frenchman Formation of Saskatchewan, the Hell Creek Formation of Montana, and the Lance Formation of South Dakota and Wyoming. It is limited to late Maastrichtian rocks, and is represented by at least twenty skulls, some with postcranial remains.<ref name=NCDE11/>  One author, Kraig Derstler, has described ''E. annectens'' as "perhaps the most perfectly-known dinosaur to date [1994]."<ref name=KD94>{{cite book |last=Derstler |first=Kraig |year=1994 |editor=Nelson, Gerald E.

''E. annectens'' differed from ''E. regalis'' by having a longer, lower, less robust skull.<ref name=DFG97/><ref name=NCDE11/> Although Brett-Surman regarded ''E. regalis'' and ''E. annectens'' as potentially representing males and females of the same species,<ref name=MKBS89/> all ''E. regalis'' specimens come from older formations than ''E. annectens'' specimens.<ref name=campione2009/>

==Paleoecology==
''Edmontosaurus'' was a wide-ranging genus in both time and space.  The rock units from which it is known can be divided into two groups by age: the older Horseshoe Canyon and St. Mary River formations, and the younger Frenchman, Hell Creek, and Lance formations. The time span covered by the Horseshoe Canyon Formation and equivalents is also known as Edmontonian, and the time span covered by the younger units is also known as Lancian. The Edmontonian and Lancian time intervals had distinct dinosaur faunas.<ref name=PD96>{{cite book|last=Dodson |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Dodson |title=The Horned Dinosaurs: A Natural History|publisher = Princeton University Press |year=1996 |location=Princeton |pages=14<U+2013>15 |isbn=0-691-05900-4}}</ref>

===Lancian paleoecology===
The Lancian time interval was the last interval before the [[Cretaceous<U+2013>Tertiary extinction event]] that eliminated non-[[bird|avian]] dinosaurs. ''Edmontosaurus'' was one of the more common dinosaurs of the interval. Robert Bakker reports that it made up one-seventh of the large dinosaur sample, with most of the rest (five-sixths) made up of the horned dinosaur ''[[Triceratops]]''.<ref name=RTB86b>Bakker, Robert T.

[[File:Hell Creek.jpg|thumb|The Hell Creek Formation is well exposed in the badlands in the vicinity of Fort Peck Reservoir.]]
The Hell Creek Formation, as typified by exposures in the [[Fort Peck, Montana|Fort Peck]] area of Montana, has been interpreted as a flat forested floodplain, with a relatively dry [[subtropics|subtropical]] climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from [[flowering plant|angiosperm]] [[tree]]s, to conifers such as bald cypress, to [[fern]]s and [[ginkgo]]s. The coastline was hundreds of kilometers or miles to the east.  Stream-dwelling turtles and [[arboreal|tree-dwelling]] [[multituberculata|multituberculate]] mammals were diverse, and [[monitor lizard]]s as large as the modern [[Komodo dragon]] hunted on the ground.  ''Triceratops'' was the most abundant large dinosaur, and ''Thescelosaurus'' the most abundant small herbivorous dinosaur. Edmontosaur remains have been collected here from stream channel sands, and include fossils from individuals as young as a meter- or yard-long infant.  The edmontosaur fossils probably represent accumulations from groups on the move.<ref name=DAR89b>Russell, Dale A. (1989). ''An Odyssey in Time: Dinosaurs of North America''. pp. 175<U+2013>180.</ref>

The Lance Formation, as typified by exposures approximately {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} north of [[Fort Laramie National Historic Site|Fort Laramie]] in eastern Wyoming, has been interpreted as a [[bayou]] setting similar to the [[Louisiana]] coastal plain.  It was closer to a large delta than the Hell Creek Formation depositional setting to the north and received much more sediment.  Tropical [[Araucariaceae|araucarian]] [[pinophyta|conifers]] and [[arecaceae|palm]] trees dotted the [[hardwood]] forests, differentiating the flora from the northern coastal plain.<ref name=DAR89c>Russell, Dale A. (1989). ''An Odyssey in Time: Dinosaurs of North America''. pp. 180<U+2013>181.</ref> The climate was humid and subtropical, with conifers, [[sabal|palmettos]], and ferns in the swamps, and conifers, [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[live oak]], and [[shrub]]s in the forests.<ref name=KD94/> Freshwater fish, salamanders, turtles, diverse lizards, snakes, shorebirds, and small mammals lived alongside the dinosaurs. Small dinosaurs are not known in as great of abundance here as in the Hell Creek rocks, but ''Thescelosaurus'' once again seems to have been relatively common. ''Triceratops'' is known from many skulls, which tend to be somewhat smaller than those of more northern individuals.  The Lance Formation is the setting of two edmontosaur "mummies".<ref name=DAR89c/>

==Paleobiology==
===Growth===
In a 2011 study, Campione and Evans recorded data from all known "edmontosaur" skulls from the Campanian and Maastrichtian and used it to plot a ''morphometric'' graph, comparing variable features of the skull with skull size. Their results showed that within both recognized ''Edmontosaurus'' species, many features previously used to classify additional species or genera were directly correlated with skull size. Campione and Evans interpreted these results as strongly suggesting that the shape of ''Edmontosaurus'' skulls changed dramatically as they grew. This has led to several apparent mistakes in classification in the past. The Campanian species ''Thespesius edmontoni'', previously considered a synonym of ''E. annectens'' due to its small size and skull shape, is morel likely a subadult specimen of the contemporary ''E. regalis''. Similarly, the three previously recognized Maastrichtian edmontosaur species likely represent growth stages of a single species, with ''E. saskatchewanensis'' representing juveniles, ''E. annectens'' subadults, and ''Anatotian copei'' fully mature adults. The skulls became longer and flatter as the animals grew.<ref name=NCDE11/>

===Diet===
{{See also|Hadrosaur diet}}

====Feeding adaptations====
As a hadrosaurid, ''Edmontosaurus'' was a large terrestrial [[herbivory|herbivore]]. Its teeth were continually replaced and packed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time.<ref name=HWF04/>  It used its broad beak to cut loose food, perhaps by cropping,<ref name=HWF04/> or by closing the jaws in a clamshell-like manner over twigs and branches and then stripping off the more nutritious leaves and shoots.<ref name=JHO64/> Because the tooth rows are deeply indented from the outside of the jaws, and because of other anatomical details, it is inferred that ''Edmontosaurus'' and most other ornithischians had cheek-like structures, muscular or non-muscular. The function of the cheeks was to retain food in the mouth.<ref name=PMG73>{{cite journal |last=Galton |first=Peter M.|year=1973 |title=The cheeks of ornithischian dinosaurs |journal=Lethaia |volume=6 |pages=67<U+2013>89 |doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.1973.tb00873.x}}</ref><ref name=FS04>Fastovsky, D.E., and Smith, J.B. (2004). "Dinosaur paleoecology."

Before the 1960s and 1970s, the prevailing interpretation of hadrosaurids like ''Edmontosaurus'' was that they were aquatic and fed on aquatic plants.<ref name=PMB05>{{cite journal |last=Barrett |first=Paul M. |year=2005 |title=The diet of ostrich dinosaurs (Theropoda: Ornithomimosauria) |journal=Palaeontology |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=347<U+2013>358 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4983.2005.00448.x }}</ref> An example of this is William Morris's 1970 interpretation of an edmontosaur skull with nonbony beak remnants. He proposed that the animal had a diet much like that of some modern ducks, filtering plants and aquatic invertebrates like [[mollusca|mollusks]] and [[crustacean]]s from the water and discharging water via V-shaped furrows along the inner face of the upper beak.<ref name=WJM70/> This interpretation of the beak has been rejected, as the furrows and ridges are more like those of herbivorous turtle beaks than the flexible structures seen in filter-feeding birds.<ref name=PMB05/>
[[File:Edmontosaurus skull 7.jpg|thumb|Skull of ''Edmontosaurus'', showing duck-bill and dentition&nbsp;<U+2013> [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]]]
The prevailing model of how hadrosaurids fed was put forward in 1984 by David B. Weishampel.  He proposed that the structure of the skull permitted motion between bones that led to backward and forward motion of the lower jaw, and outward bowing of the tooth-bearing bones of the upper jaw when the mouth was closed.  The teeth of the upper jaw would grind against the teeth of the lower jaw like [[rasp]]s, processing plant material trapped between them.<ref name=HWF04/><ref name=DBW84>{{cite book |last=Weishampel |first=David B. |authorlink=David B.

Other movements could produce similar scratches, though, such as movement of the bones of the two halves of the lower jaw. Not all models have been scrutinized under present techniques.<ref name=CHLW08>{{cite journal|last=Holliday|first=Casey M. |coauthors=and Witmer, Lawrence M. |year=2008 |title=Cranial kinesis in dinosaurs: intracranial joints, protractor muscles, and their significance for cranial evolution and function in diapsids |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=1073<U+2013>1088|doi=10.1671/0272-4634-28.4.1073}}</ref>

Weishampel developed his model with the aid of a computer simulation. Natalia Rybczynski and colleagues have updated this work with a much more sophisticated [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] animation model, scanning a skull of ''E. regalis'' with lasers.  They were able to replicate the proposed motion with their model, although they found that additional secondary movements between other bones were required, with maximum separations of {{convert|1.3|to|1.4|cm|in|sp=us}} between some bones during the chewing cycle. Rybczynski and colleagues were not convinced that the Weishampel model is viable, but noted that they have several improvements to implement to their animation.  Planned improvements include incorporating soft tissue and tooth wear marks and scratches, which should better constrain movements. They note that there are several other hypotheses to test as well.<ref name=NRetal08/> Further work by Casey Holliday and Lawrence Witmer found that ornithopods like ''Edmontosaurus'' lacked the types of skull joints seen in those modern animals that are known to have kinetic skulls (skulls that permit motion between their constituent bones), such as [[squamata|squamates]] and birds.  They proposed that joints that had been interpreted as permitting movement in dinosaur skulls were actually [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] growth zones.<ref name=CHLW08/>

The immobile skull model was challenged in 2009 by Vincent Williams and colleagues.  Returning to tooth microwear, they found four classes of scratches on ''Edmontosaurus'' teeth.  The most common class was interpreted as resulting from an oblique motion, not a simple up-down or front-back motion, which is more consistent with the Weishampel model.  This motion is thought to have been the primary motion for grinding food.  Two scratch classes were interpreted as resulting from forward or backward movement of the jaws.  The other class was variable and probably resulted from opening the jaws.  The combination of movements is more complex than had been previously predicted.  Because scratches dominate the microwear texture, Williams ''et al.'' suggested ''Edmontosaurus'' was a [[grazing|grazer]] instead of a [[Browsing (predation)|browser]], which would be predicted to have fewer scratches due to eating less abrasive materials.  Candidates for ingested abrasives include [[silicon dioxide|silica]]-rich plants like [[equisetum|horsetails]] and soil that was accidentally ingested due to feeding at ground level.<ref name=VSWetal09>{{cite journal |last=Williams |first=Vincent S. |coauthors=Barrett, Paul M.; and Purnell, Mark A. |year=2009 |title=Quantitative analysis of dental microwear in hadrosaurid dinosaurs, and the implications for hypotheses of jaw mechanics and feeding |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |pmid=19564603 |volume=106 |issue=27 |pmc=2708679 |pages=11194<U+2013>11199 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0812631106 }}</ref>

Reports of [[gastrolith]]s, or stomach stones, in the hadrosaurid ''Claosaurus'' are actually based on a probable double misidentification.  First, the specimen is actually of ''Edmontosaurus annectens''.  [[Barnum Brown]], who discovered the specimen in 1900, referred to it as ''Claosaurus'' because ''E. annectens'' was thought to be a species of ''Claosaurus'' at the time.  Additionally, it is more likely that the supposed gastroliths represent gravel washed in during burial.<ref name=BSC07/>

At the time, hadrosaurids were thought to have been aquatic animals, and Kr<U+00E4>usel made a point of stating that the specimen did not rule out hadrosaurids eating water plants.<ref name=JHO64/><ref name=RK22/> The discovery of possible gut contents made little impact in English-speaking circles, except for another brief mention of the aquatic-terrestrial dichotomy,<ref name=GRW25>{{cite journal |last=Wieland |first=G.

Instead of trying to adapt the discovery to the aquatic model, he used it as a line of evidence that hadrosaurids were terrestrial herbivores.<ref name=JHO64/> While his interpretation of hadrosaurids as terrestrial animals has been generally accepted,<ref name=HWF04/> the Senckenberg plant fossils remain equivocal. [[Kenneth Carpenter]] has suggested that they may actually represent the gut contents of a starving animal, instead of a typical diet.<ref name=KC87/><ref name=KC07/> Other authors have noted that because the plant fossils were removed from their original context in the specimen and were heavily prepared, it is no longer possible to follow up on the original work, leaving open the possibility that the plants were washed-in debris.<ref name=CKM97/><ref name=JTetal2008>{{cite journal |last=Tweet |first=Justin S. |coauthors=Chin, Karen; Braman, Dennis R.; and Murphy, Nate L. |year=2008 |title=Probable gut contents within a specimen of ''Brachylophosaurus canadensis'' (Dinosauria: Hadrosauridae) from the Upper Cretaceous Judith River Formation of Montana |journal=PALAIOS |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages=624<U+2013>635 |doi=10.2110/palo.2007.p07-044r}}</ref>

===Isotopic studies===
The diet and [[physiology]] of ''Edmontosaurus'' have been probed by using [[stable isotope]]s of [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] as recorded in [[tooth enamel]]. When feeding, drinking, and breathing, animals take in carbon and oxygen, which become incorporated into bone.  The isotopes of these two elements are determined by various internal and external factors, such as the type of plants being eaten, the physiology of the animal, [[salinity]], and climate.  If isotope ratios in fossils are not altered by fossilization and later [[diagenesis|changes]], they can be studied for information about the original factors; [[endothermy|warmblooded]] animals will have certain isotopic compositions compared to their surroundings, animals that eat certain types of plants or use certain digestive processes will have distinct isotopic compositions, and so on.  Enamel is typically used because the structure of the mineral that forms enamel makes it the most resistant material to chemical change in the skeleton.<ref name=TC04/>

A 2004 study by Kathryn Thomas and Sandra Carlson used teeth from the upper jaw of three individuals interpreted as a juvenile, a subadult, and an adult, recovered from a bone bed in the Hell Creek Formation of [[Corson County, South Dakota|Corson County]], South Dakota.  In this study, successive teeth in columns in the edmontosaurs' dental batteries were sampled from multiple locations along each tooth using a microdrilling system. This sampling method takes advantage of the organization of hadrosaurid dental batteries to find variation in tooth isotopes over a period of time.  From their work, it appears that edmontosaur teeth took less than about 0.65&nbsp;years to form, slightly faster in younger edmontosaurs.  The teeth of all three individuals appeared to show variation in oxygen isotope ratios that could correspond to warm/dry and cool/wet periods; Thomas and Carlson considered the possibility that the animals were migrating instead, but favored local seasonal variations because migration would have more likely led to ratio homogenization, as many animals migrate to stay within specific temperature ranges or near particular food sources.<ref name=TC04/>

The edmontosaurs also showed enriched carbon isotope values, which for modern mammals would be interpreted as a mixed diet of [[C3 carbon fixation|C3]] plants (most plants) and [[C4 carbon fixation|C4]] plants (grasses); however, C4 plants were extremely rare in the Late Cretaceous if present at all.  Thomas and Carlson put forward several factors that may have been operating, and found the most likely to include a diet heavy in [[gymnosperm]]s, consuming salt-stressed plants from coastal areas adjacent to the [[Western Interior Seaway]], and a physiological difference between dinosaurs and mammals that caused dinosaurs to form tissue with different carbon ratios than would be expected for mammals. A combination of factors is also possible.<ref name=TC04/>

===Pathologies and health===
In 2003, evidence of [[tumor]]s, including [[hemangioma]]s, [[desmoplastic fibroma]], [[metastatic cancer]], and [[osteoblastoma]], was described in ''Edmontosaurus'' bones. Rothschild ''et al.'' tested dinosaur vertebrae for tumors using [[computerized tomography]] and [[fluoroscope]] screening. Several other hadrosaurids, including ''Brachylophosaurus'', ''[[Gilmoreosaurus]]'', and ''[[Bactrosaurus]]'', also tested positive. Although more than 10,000&nbsp;fossils were examined in this manner, the tumors were limited to ''Edmontosaurus'' and closely related genera. The tumors may have been caused by environmental factors or [[genetics|genetic propensity]].<ref name="Rothschildetal">{{cite journal |last=Rothschild |first=B.M. |coauthors=Tanke, D. H.; Helbling II, M.; and Martin, L.D. |title=Epidemiologic study of tumors in dinosaurs |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=90 |issue=11 |pages=495<U+2013>500 |year=2003 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/ktqqkxcqdc620keb/ |doi=10.1007/s00114-003-0473-9 |accessdate=2008-07-25 |pmid=14610645}}</ref>

[[Osteochondrosis]], or surficial pits in bone at places where bones articulate, is also known in ''Edmontosaurus''.  This condition, resulting from [[cartilage]] failing to be replaced by bone during growth, was found to be present in 2.2% of 224&nbsp;edmontosaur toe bones.  The underlying cause of the condition is unknown.  Genetic predisposition, trauma, feeding intensity, alterations in blood supply, excess [[thyroid]] [[hormone]]s, and deficiencies in various growth factors have been suggested.  Among dinosaurs, osteochondrosis (like tumors) is most commonly found in hadrosaurids.<ref name=BRDT07>{{cite book |last=Rothschild |first=Bruce |coauthors=and Tanke, Darren H. |year=2007 |chapter=Osteochondrosis is Late Cretaceous Hadrosauria |editor=Carpenter, Kenneth (ed.) |title=Horns and Beaks: Ceratopsian and Ornithopod Dinosaurs |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington and Indianapolis |pages=171<U+2013>183 |isbn=0-253-34817-X}}</ref>

===Locomotion===
[[image:Edmontosaurus BW.jpg|thumb|left|Life restoration of an ''E. regalis'' in a quadrupedal pose]]
Like other hadrosaurids, ''Edmontosaurus'' is thought to have been a [[facultative biped]], meaning that it mostly moved on four legs, but could adopt a bipedal stance when needed.  It probably went on all fours when standing still or moving slowly, and switched to using  the hind legs alone when moving more rapidly.<ref name=HWF04/> Research conducted by computer modeling in 2007 suggests that ''Edmontosaurus'' could run at high speeds, perhaps up to {{convert|45|km/h|mph|sp=us}}.<ref name="ng"/> Further simulations using a subadult specimen estimated as weighing {{convert|715|kg|lb|sp=us}} when alive produced a model that could run or hop bipedally, use a [[trot (horse gait)|trot]], [[Horse gait#Pace|pace]], or single foot symmetric quadrupedal gait, or move at a [[Horse gait#Gallop|gallop]].  The researchers found to their surprise that the fastest gait was [[kangaroo]]-like hopping (maximum simulated speed of {{convert|17.3|m/s|km/h mph|sp=us}}), which they regarded as unlikely based on the size of the animal and lack of hopping footprints in the fossil record, and instead interpreted the result as indicative of an inaccuracy in their simulation.  The fastest non-hopping gaits were  galloping (maximum simulated speed of {{convert|15.7|m/s|km/h mph|sp=us}}) and running bipedally (maximum simulated speed of {{convert|14.0|m/s|km/h mph|sp=us}}).  They found weak support for bipedal running as the most likely option for high-speed movement, but did not rule out high-speed quadrupedal movement.<ref name=WISetal09>{{cite journal |last=Sellers |first=W.

While long thought to have been aquatic or semiaquatic, hadrosaurids were not as well-suited for swimming as other dinosaurs (particularly theropods, who were once thought to have been unable to pursue hadrosaurids into water). Hadrosaurids had slim hands with short fingers, making their forelimbs ineffective for propulsion, and the tail was also not useful for propulsion because of the ossified tendons that increased its rigidity, and the poorly developed attachment points for muscles that would have moved the tail from side to side.<ref name=RTB86/><ref name=MKBS97>{{cite book |last=Brett-Surman |first=M.

===Interactions with theropods===
[[File:DMNS Edmontosaurus.png|thumb|The damage to the tail vertebrae of this ''Edmontosaurus'' skeleton (on display at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science) indicates that it may have been bitten by a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''.]]
The time span and geographic range of ''Edmontosaurus'' overlapped with ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', and an adult specimen of ''E. annectens'' on display in the [[Denver Museum of Nature and Science]] shows evidence of a theropod bite in the tail. Counting back from the hip, the thirteenth to seventeenth [[vertebra]]e have damaged [[spinous process|spines]] consistent with an attack from the right rear of the animal. One spine has a portion sheared away, and the others are kinked; three have apparent tooth puncture marks. The top of the tail was at least {{convert|2.9|m|ft|sp=us}} high, and the only theropod species known from the same rock formation that was tall enough to make such an attack is ''T. rex''. The bones are partially healed, but the edmontosaur died before the traces of damage were completely obliterated.  The damage also shows signs of bone infection. Kenneth Carpenter, who studied the specimen, noted that there also seems to be a healed fracture in the left hip which predated the attack because it was more fully healed.  He suggested that the edmontosaur was a target because it may have been limping from this earlier injury.  Because it survived the attack, Carpenter suggested that it may have outmaneuvered or outran its attacker, or that the damage to its tail was incurred by the hadrosaurid using it as a weapon against the tyrannosaur.<ref name=carpenter1998>{{cite_journal |last=Carpenter |first=Kenneth |authorlink=Kenneth Carpenter |year=1998 |title=Evidence of predatory behavior by theropod dinosaurs |journal=Gaia |volume=15 |pages=135<U+2013>144 |url=http://vertpaleo.org/publications/jvp/15-576-591.cfm |accessdate=2009-03-08}} [not printed until 2000]</ref>

Another specimen of ''E. annectens'', pertaining to a {{convert|7.6|m|ft|sp=us}} long individual from South Dakota, shows evidence of tooth marks from small theropods on its lower jaws.  Some of the marks are partially healed.  Michael Triebold, informally reporting on the specimen, suggested a scenario where small theropods attacked the throat of the edmontosaur; the animal survived the initial attack but succumbed to its injuries shortly thereafter.<ref name=CT00>{{cite journal |last=Campagna |first=Tony |year=2000 |title=The PT interview: Michael Triebold |journal=Prehistoric Times |volume=40 |pages=18<U+2013>19}}</ref> Some edmontosaur bone beds were sites of scavenging. ''Albertosaurus'' and ''[[Saurornitholestes]]'' tooth marks are common at one Alberta bone bed,<ref name=JR99>{{cite journal |last=Jacobsen |first=Aase Roland |coauthors=and Ryan, Michael J. |year=2000 |title=Taphonomic aspects of theropod tooth-marked bones from an ''Edmontosaurus'' bone bed (Lower Maastrichtian), Alberta, Canada |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=19 |issue=3, suppl. |pages=55A }}</ref> and ''[[Daspletosaurus]]'' fed on ''Edmontosaurus'' and fellow hadrosaurid ''Saurolophus'' at another Alberta site.<ref name=SciDaily07/>

===Social behavior===
Extensive [[bone bed]]s are known for ''Edmontosaurus'', and such groupings of hadrosaurids are used to suggest that they were gregarious, living in groups.<ref name=HWF04/> Four quarries containing edmontosaur remains are identified in a 2007 database of fossil bone beds, from Alaska (Prince Creek Formation), Alberta (Horseshoe Canyon Formation), South Dakota (Hell Creek Formation), and Wyoming (Lance Formation).<ref name=bbdb07/> One edmontosaur bone bed, from [[claystone]] and [[mudstone]] of the Lance Formation in eastern Wyoming, covers more than a square kilometer, although ''Edmontosaurus'' bones are most concentrated in a {{convert|40|ha|sqmi}} subsection of this site.  It is estimated that disassociated remains pertaining to 10,000 to 25,000&nbsp;edmontosaurs are present here.<ref name=ACetal06>{{cite journal |last=Chadwick |first=Arthur |coauthors=Spencer, Lee; and Turner, Larry |year=2006 |title=Preliminary depositional model for an Upper Cretaceous ''Edmontosaurus'' bonebed |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=26 |issue=3, suppl. |pages=49A }}</ref>

Unlike many other hadrosaurids, ''Edmontosaurus'' lacked a bony crest. It may have had soft-tissue display structures in the skull, though: the bones around the nasal openings had deep indentations surrounding the openings, and this pair of recesses are postulated to have held inflatable air sacs, perhaps allowing for both visual and auditory signaling.<ref name=JAH75/>  ''Edmontosaurus'' may have been [[Polymorphism (biology)|dimorphic]], with more robust and more lightly built forms, but it has not been established if this is related to [[sexual dimorphism]].<ref name=GRetal03>{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Rebecca |coauthors=Larson, Robb; and Nellermoe, Ron |year=2003 |title=An allometric study comparing metatarsal IIs in ''Edmontosaurus'' from a low-diversity hadrosaur bone bed in Corson Co., SD |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=23 |issue=3, suppl. |pages=56A<U+2013>57A }}</ref>

Because of its wide distribution, which covers a distance from Alaska to Colorado and includes [[Dinosaur physiology#Polar dinosaurs|polar settings]] that would have had little light during a significant part of the year, ''Edmontosaurus'' has been considered possibly migratory. A 2008 review of dinosaur migration studies by Phil R. Bell and Eric Snively proposed that ''E. regalis'' was capable of an annual {{convert|2600|km|mi|sp=us}} round-trip journey, provided it had the requisite [[metabolism]] and fat deposition rates.  Such a trip would have required speeds of about {{convert|2|to|10|km/h|mph|0|sp=us}}, and could have brought it from Alaska to Alberta.  The possible migratory nature of ''Edmontosaurus'' contrasts with many other dinosaurs, such as [[Theropoda|theropods]], [[Sauropoda|sauropods]], and [[ankylosauria]]ns, which Bell and Snively found were more likely to have [[overwinter]]ed.<ref name=PBES08>{{cite journal|last=Bell |first=Phil R. |coauthors=and Snively, E. |year=2008 |title=Polar dinosaurs on parade: a review of dinosaur migration |journal=Alcheringa |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=271<U+2013>284 |doi=10.1080/03115510802096101}}</ref><ref name=RLlivesci08>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/animals/081204-polar-dinosaurs.html |title=Polar Dinosaurs Endured Cold Dark Winters |last=Lloyd |first=Robin |date=2008-12-04 |work=LiveScience.com |publisher=Imaginova |accessdate=2008-12-11}}</ref> In contrast to Bell and Snively, Anusuya Chinsamy and colleagues concluded from a study of bone microstructure that polar ''Edmontosaurus'' overwintered.<ref name=ACetal12>{{cite journal |last1=Chinsamy |first1=A. |last2=Thomas |first2=D.
