'''''Whistler''''' is a [[Canadian]] [[television drama]] centering on the aftermath of the mysterious death of a local snowboard legend.  The show begins when Beck McKaye ([[David Paetkau]] of ''[[Final Destination 2]]'') returns home from the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] with a gold medal.  Upon his death, the show explores the lives of his friends and family - all of whom have stories to tell and secrets to keep.

The secret-keeping locals are the only ones who can answer the terrifying truth of the show's tagline, "What secrets lie beneath the snow?"  McKaye's friends and family each have their own stories, as well as secrets they attempt to hide as the show progresses.
In particular, Beck's brother Quinn (Moss) must try to solve the mystery of Beck's death.[http://www.tv.com/whistler/show/34571/summary.html?full_summary=1&tag=showspace_links;full_summary]

Following the solution of Beck's death at the end of the first season, the series' second season shifts the focus to the lives and adventures of both returning and new characters. The McKayes, Varlands and Millers have put the pieces of their lives together and are ready to make a new start. Quinn steps out from his brother<U+2019>s shadow to carve out a name for himself on the mountain, while his mother comes to terms with her past and earns a future for herself. The Varlands fight to overcome their dark history and regain control of Whistler, while the Millers make new discoveries that may upset the balance of power. The show's second season tagline is "What new secrets lie hidden beneath the snow? The truth is hard to find. In Whistler it<U+2019>s just about impossible."[http://www.contentfilm.com/index.php/film_tv/fireworks_international/new_shows/407.html]

[[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]] is the co-host for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] (along with Vancouver), and for this reason, CTV, the network in possession of the broadcast rights to the 2010 Olympics, specifically asked that this series be set in Whistler. Several members of Canada's male snowboarding team come from Whistler - thus the obvious tie-in to the show.

Although some of the outdoor shots used in the series were filmed in and around Whistler, most of the outdoor (and all of the indoor) scenes were filmed at Uphill Studios in Langley, B.C., about 45 km (27 mi) southeast of Vancouver. All of the post-production was done in Vancouver by Uphill Productions.

Currently, a lawsuit has been filed against [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] by Olympic snowboarder [[Ross Rebagliati]], accusing the network of "misappropriating" his identity with Whistler's main character Beck McKaye. The suit has not yet been heard by the [[British Columbia Supreme Court]].[http://today.reuters.com/news/articleinvesting.aspx?view=CN&storyID=2006-08-02T193402Z_01_N02262272_RTRIDST_0_LEISURE-CANADA-SNOWBOARDER-PICTURE.XML&rpc=66&type=qcna]

== Television air dates ==
Whistler premiered on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] on June 25, 2006, [http://www.ctv.ca/generic/generated/shows/AtoZ.html], and on [[The N]] in the United States on [[June 30]], 2006.

The show aired in Canada on Sunday nights at 10 pm local time until August 14 when CTV announced it was moving the series to Monday nights at 9 pm local time. However, after just one airing in that time slot, CTV returned the series to Sunday nights at 10 pm, effective with the August 20th telecast. CTV aired the final two episodes of season one back to back on Friday, August 25.

From November 25, 2006 to February 3, 2007, CTV rebroadcast the series on Saturdays at 10 pm local time and Sunday afternoons at 4 pm local time. The CTV rebroadcast of the series pilot "Fallen" was an alternate version that included a slightly different opening scene, a different main title segment and some minor editing of a few other scenes.

The N continued to air only one episode a week in the United States, eventually shifting the final five episodes to Saturday mornings at 1 am before completing the series on September 23. The station began re-airing the series on Monday, January 22, 2007 at 5 am but for unexplained reasons omitted airing the first episode "Fallen" and began with the second episode "Out Of The Shadows".

The series also aired on the British youth channel [[Trouble (TV station)|Trouble]] beginning October 16, 2006 on Monday nights at 9pm and on the Polish catholic channel [[Puls (TV station)|Puls]] on Saturday and Sunday evenings at 6:20pm. French language broadcasts of Whistler aired from January 30 to April 29, 2007 on a Canadian cable channel, [[S<U+00E9>ries Plus (TV station)|S<U+00E9>ries Plus]] Tuesday nights at 8pm.

Season 2 began filming on January 8, 2007 and was completed on May 23, 2007. As with the first season, there are 13 episodes for season 2. CTV announced that the episodes will air in Canada beginning on September 29, 2007 on Saturday nights at 9pm following encore presentations of the final three episodes of Season 1 that began on September 1, 2007 in the same day and time slot. The-N has been confirmed as a co-producer and American rights holder for the second season but has not officially announced when it will air these episodes. 
As of [[November]] 2007 [[The-N]] has yet to air Season Two. It Is possible that the second season will air when The-N becomes a full network in December.

In addition to the 13 first season broadcast episodes, 13 "webisodes" were also produced for viewing in Canada on the CTV Broadband Network. The same webisodes were also available in the United States on The N's "The Click" website and the Britain's Trouble on-demand website. The webisodes were short scenes that depicted an event that took place either between broadcast episodes or during an episode (but not seen during the episode). Because the webisodes were not given official titles by the producers, CTV and The N used different titles to refer to them on their respective websites.

In addition to the 13 second season broadcast episodes, 10 "webisodes" and 10 "extra scenes" were produced for the CTV Broadband Network.

The full episodes and webisodes/extra scenes can be viewed online (in Canada only) at http://broadband.ctv.ca/primetime/
