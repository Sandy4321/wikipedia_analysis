'''Mark Nicholas Stimson''' (born 27 December 1967)<ref>{{cite book |   first=Roger|last= Triggs |   title=The Men Who Made Gillingham Football Club|   publisher=Tempus Publishing Ltd |   year=2001|   id=ISBN 0-7524-2243-X|pages=p307}}</ref> is an English former professional [[football (soccer)|footballer]] and subsequently [[coach (sport)|manager]] and current manager of [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]].  He signed his first professional contract with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in 1985, but was unable to gain a regular place in the team.  In 1989, he moved on to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], where he made over 80 appearances in [[the Football League]].  He later played for [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] and [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] before dropping into [[non-league football]].

He was appointed manager of [[Grays Athletic F.C.|Grays Athletic]] in 2003 and remained in charge until 2006 when he took over as manager of [[Stevenage Borough F.C.|Stevenage Borough]].  He led Grays to victory in the final of the [[FA Trophy]] in 2005 and 2006, and repeated the feat with Stevenage in 2007.  In November 2007, he became manager of a Football League team for the first time when he took over at one of his former clubs, [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], but he was unable to prevent the club's [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] from [[Football League One]] at the end of the [[2007-08 in English football|2007<U+2013>08]] season. He led Gillingham back into League One the following season with a 1<U+2013>0 win over [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] in the [[2009 Football League Two play-off Final|League Two play-off final]], but his contract was terminated after the "Gills" were relegated back to League Two the following season.

==Playing career==
Born in [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]], Stimson played for the [[Essex]] county representative football team and was on the books of [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], before joining [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on an apprenticeship in July 1984.    A year later, he signed his first professional contract, at the age of 17.<ref name="triggs">{{cite book |   first=Roger|last= Triggs |   title=The Men Who Made Gillingham Football Club|pages=p308}}</ref>  He made his [[the Football League|Football League]] debut against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in May 1987,<ref name="CI">{{cite web|url=http://www.canveyislandfc.co.uk/2000/squad.htm#Mark%20Stimson|title=2000<U+2013>01 squad|publisher=Canvey Island F.C.|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref> but struggled to gain a place in the first team, and was sent to [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] on loan in March 1988, where he played ten times.<ref name="SB">{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=7641|title=Mark Stimson|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref>  During the following season, he was loaned out again, this time to [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], whose manager, [[Keith Burkinshaw]], had worked with him at Tottenham.  Stimson made 18 appearances for the [[Kent]]-based club and, although he was unable to help the team avoid [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] from the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]], his contribution impressed the fans, who voted him into second place in the club's player of the year ballot.<ref name="triggs" />

At the end of the [[1988-89 in English football|1988<U+2013>89]] season, Stimson was transferred to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], then in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/NEWCASTU.HTM|title=Newcastle United|accessdate=2008-09-03|publisher=The Football Club History Database}}</ref> for a fee of <U+00A3>200,000.<ref name="SB" />  He spent four years with the club and finally gained a regular first team place, making over 80 appearances.<ref name="SB" />  After [[Kevin Keegan]] took over as manager, however, Stimson found himself out of favour and he had a short spell on loan to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in December 1992, which led to a <U+00A3>100,000 transfer at the end of that season.<ref name="triggs" /><ref name="Sun2">{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LSNB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F934C29685AF044&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815|title=The Great career <U+2013> Profile|work=The Sun|accessdate=2008-09-02|date=1997-01-09}}</ref>  He made over fifty appearances for Portsmouth but was also loaned out once again, this time to [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] during the early part of the [[1995-96 in English football|1995<U+2013>96]] season.<ref name="SB" />  In March 1996, he was transferred to [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] for a fee of <U+00A3>25,000.<ref name="SB" />  His first season at the club was affected by a long lay-off due to injury,<ref name="Sun">{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LSNB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F9350C11D5406C4&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815|title=Foley: Time to get back to our Roots <U+2013> Football|work=The Sun|accessdate=2008-09-02|date=1996-11-02}}</ref> meaning that he did not play between August and November,<ref name="SB96">{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?seasonid=126&playerid=7641|title=Games played by Mark Stimson in 1996/1997|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> but he ultimately made over 50 Football League appearances for the club.<ref name="SB" />  During his time at [[Roots Hall]] the club suffered two consecutive relegations, dropping from the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] into the Second Division in 1997 and from there into the Third Division in 1998.<ref name="South">{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/SOUTHENU.HTM|title=Southend United|publisher=The Football Club History Database|accessdate=2008-09-06}}</ref>  In March 1999, having not played for Southend since the previous November, he returned to former club Leyton Orient on a [[Free transfer (football)|free transfer]].<ref name="SB98" />  He played for the club in the semi-finals of the [[Football League Two play-offs|play-offs]], but was restricted to an appearance as an unused substitute in the final, which Orient lost.<ref name="SB98">{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?seasonid=128&playerid=7641|title=Games played by Mark Stimson in 1998/1999|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref><ref name="SB99">{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/results3.sd?gameid=306797|title=League Two Play-Off <U+2013> Final <U+2013> KO 15:00|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref>

Prior to the [[1999-2000 in English football|1999<U+2013>2000]] season, Stimson spent a short period on trial at another of his former clubs, Gillingham, but manager [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]] decided against offering him a contract and he instead joined [[Isthmian League]] club [[Canvey Island F.C.|Canvey Island]].<ref name="triggs" />  He helped the "Gulls" win the [[FA Trophy]] in the [[2000-01 in English football|2000<U+2013>01]] season, setting up the only goal and winning the man of the match award in Canvey's 1<U+2013>0 defeat of [[Forest Green Rovers F.C.|Forest Green Rovers]] in the final.<ref name="triggs" /><ref name="FG">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/canveys-class-takes-trophy-684653.html|title=Football: Canvey's class takes Trophy|work=The Independent|date=2001-05-14|author=Rupert Metcalf|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref>  He was also selected to play for the [[England C national football team|England National Game XI]], the national team for semi-professional players,<ref name="FA">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/NationalGameXI/NewsAndFeatures/33657.htm|title=Stimson proud to play for England|publisher=The Football Association|date=2002-12-10|accessdate=2008-09-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050411002559/http://www.thefa.com/England/NationalGameXI/NewsAndFeatures/33657.htm |archivedate = April 11, 2005}}</ref> earning one [[Cap (sport)|cap]] against an equivalent team from the United States of America.<ref>{{cite book|title=Non-League Club Directory 2007|first=Mike|last=Williams|coauthors=Tony Williams|year=2007|publisher=Tony Williams Publications Ltd|id=1-8698-3355-4|page=p860}}</ref>  He left Canvey in May 2002 to join [[Grays Athletic F.C.|Grays Athletic]] as player-coach.<ref name="GA">{{cite news|title=Grays in swoop for Gulls|work=The Gazette|date=2002-05-03|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref>

==Managerial career==
In September 2002, Stimson took over as manager of Grays after the sacking of Craig Edwards, initially as [[caretaker manager]], but after leading the team to its first victory of the season, he was quickly given the job on an ongoing basis.<ref>{{cite news
