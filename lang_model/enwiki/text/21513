The '''[[Heraklion]] Archaeological Museum''' is one the great museums of [[Greece]] and the best in the world regarding the [[Minoan]] art as it contains the most notable and complete collection of artifacts of the [[Minoan civilization]] of [[Crete]]. The museum began in [[1883]] as a simple collection of antiquities. A dedicated building  was constructed from [[1904]] to [[1912]] at the instigation of two Cretan archaeologists, [[Iosif Hatzidakis]] and [[Stefanos Xanthoudidis]]. From [[1937]], work began on the present earthquake-proof building, designed by the renowned Greek architect [[Patroklos Karantinos]]. The museum was damaged during [[World War II]], but the collection survived intact and was again accessible to the public from [[1952]]. A new wing was added in [[1964]].

Besides the [[Minoan]] collection, other periods of [[Cretan history]] are covered, from the [[Neolithic]] to the [[Greco-Roman period]].
The '''Archaeological Museum at [[Heraklion]]''' is dedicated to [[Minoan]] art and artefacts, with a smaller section for post-Minoan art and artefacts. (The Museum is currently being renovated but a temporary exhibition is open in the main building.)
