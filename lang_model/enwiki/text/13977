'''Yelena Gadschiyevna Isinbayeva''' (Russian: '''<U+0415><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0418><U+0441><U+0438><U+043D><U+0431><U+0430><U+0435><U+0432><U+0430>'''; born {{birth date and age|1982|6|3}} in [[Volgograd]]) is a [[Russia]]n [[pole vault]]er. She won the [[2004]] Olympic Gold Medal with a new World Record (then 4.91 m), was elected Female Athlete of the Year by the [[IAAF]] twice (2004 and 2005), and Sportswoman of the Year by [[Laureus]], and has set 20 [[World Record progression Pole Vault women|world record]]s. On [[July 22]], [[2005]], she became the first female pole vaulter to clear 5.00 metres.

At the age of 25 she is seen as the best female pole vaulter in history. She has already crowned herself 5-time major champion (Olympic, World outdoor and indoor champion and European outdoor and indoor champion) and became the first woman to clear the metric barrier of 5.00&nbsp;m.

==Career==
===1987-1997===
From the age of 5 to 15, Isinbayeva trained as a [[gymnastics|gymnast]] in her hometown of [[Volgograd]].  She ultimately left the sport because as she grew she was considered too tall to be competitive in gymnastics, ultimately attaining a height of 1.74 m (5'8.5").

===1998-2002===
In her first big competition, the [[1998]] World Junior Championships in [[Annecy]], [[France]], Yelena jumped 4.00&nbsp;m but this left her 10&nbsp;cm away from the medal placings.

In [[1999]], Yelena improved on this at the World Youth Games in [[Bydgoszcz]], [[Poland]] when she cleared 4.10&nbsp;m to take her first gold medal.

The following year at the World Junior's she again took first place clearing 4.20&nbsp;m ahead of [[Germany|German]] Annika Becker. The same year the women's pole vault made its debut as an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] event in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] where [[Stacy Dragila]] of [[United States]] took gold.

[[2001]] saw another gold medal, this time at the European Junior Championships with a winning height of 4.40&nbsp;m.

She continued to improve in this relatively new event and [[2002]] saw her clear 4.55&nbsp;m. at the European Championships finishing 5&nbsp;cm short of compatriot [[Svetlana Feofanova]]'s gold medal winning jump.

===2003===
[[2003]] was another year of progression and saw Yelena win the European Under 23 Championships gold with 4.65&nbsp;m (in [[Bydgoszcz]]). She went onto break the [[world record]] clearing 4.82&nbsp;m on [[July 13]] at a meeting in [[Gateshead]], [[England]] which had made her the favourite to take gold at the [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]] the following month, but lack of technique saw her only win bronze with Feofanova taking gold and Becker, this time, pipping her for the silver.

===2004===
[[2004]] saw the women's pole vault really start to mature as an event and during a meeting at [[Donetsk]], [[Ukraine]], Yelena set a new indoor worlds best, with a height of 4.83&nbsp;m only to see Feofanova increase this by a single centimetre the following week. The following month at the World's Indoor in March Yelena broke this with a gold medal winning jump of 4.86&nbsp;m beating reigning indoor & outdoor champion Feofanova into bronze with reigning [[2000 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] champion Dragila taking silver.

[[June 27]] saw her return to Gateshead and once again the world record mark was improved to 4.87&nbsp;m. Feofanova bounced back the following week to again break the record by a centimetre in [[Heraklion]], [[Greece]].

On [[July 25]] in [[Birmingham]], England, Yelena reclaimed the record jumping 4.89&nbsp;m and five days later in [[Crystal Palace, London]], added a further centimetre to the record.

The pole vault was one of the most eagerly awaited events at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], Greece and although the competition did not reach the heights that were anticipated the rivalry between Yelena and Feofanova brought the event alive. With all of the other events finished the whole crowd were focused on the pole vault.

When Feofanova failed at 4.90 m the [[gold medal]] was Yelena's, and she then rubbed salt into her compatriots wound by attempting and clearing a new world record height of 4.91 m.

===2005===
In July 2005, she broke the world record four times over three separate meetings. First in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], she added an extra centimetre to her own mark clearing 4.93 m. It was the 14th world record of Isinbayeva's career coming just three months after she broke her own indoor mark (4.89 m) in [[Lievin]]. Eleven days later, in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], she added an additional 2 cm to clear 4.95 m. In [[Crystal Palace, London]] on [[July 22]], after improving the record to 4.96 m, she raised the bar to 5.00 m. She then became the first woman pole vaulter to clear this metric barrier, achieving the mark with a single attempt. 
At the [[2005 World Championships in Athletics]], she once again broke her own world record, performing 5.01 m in her second attempt, and winning the competition.

===2006===
At an indoor meeting on [[February 12]] in [[Donetsk]], [[Ukraine]], Isinbayeva set a new indoor world record. She cleared 4.91 m. In August she won the gold medal at the [[2006 European Athletics Championships]] in [[Gothenburg]].

Isinbayeva was crowned [[Laureus World Sports Award for Sportswoman of the Year|Laureus World Sports Woman of the Year]] for the 2006 season.

===2007===
On [[10 February]] [[2007]] in [[Donetsk]], [[Ukraine]], Isinbayeva broke the world indoor pole vault record again, by clearing 4.93 metres. It was Isinbayeva's 20th world record. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/more/02/10/bc.run.polevault.worldr.ap/index.html?eref=si_more]

== Reasons for success ==
Setting 20 world records, staying virtually unbeaten since the Olympic Games of 2004 (winning eight straight gold medals in indoor and outdoor championships) and being elected IAAF Female Athlete of the Year in 2004 and 2005, Isinbayeva has established herself as one of the most successful athletes of her generation.

In August 2005, top UK pole vault coach Steve Rippon said to the BBC that "she [Isinbayeva] is one of the few female pole vaulters I look at and think her technique is as good as the men's. In fact, the second part of her jump is probably better than any male pole vaulter currently competing. She has a fantastic technique, she's quite tall (almost 5ft 9in) and she runs extremely well." [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/4137996.stm].

These statements are confirmable by [http://www.stabhoch.com/pages/Isinbajeva.html close observation of her jumps]; in detail, Isinbayeva's high level of body control (courtesy of her gymnastics background) especially pays off in the so-called "L-Phase", where it is vital to use the pole's rebound to convert horizontal speed into height. Common mistakes are getting rebounded away in an angle (rather than vertically up) or inability to keep the limbs stiff, both resulting in loss of vertical speed and therefore less height. In Isinbayeva's case, her L-Phase is exemplary.

== Personal life ==
Her father, Gadzhi Gadzhiyevich Isinbayev, is a plumber and a member of a small (70,000-people strong) ethnic group of [[Tabasaran people|Tabasaran]]s who mostly live in [[Dagestan]]. Her mother, a shop assistant, is an ethnic Russian. Isinbayeva also has a sister called Inna. Isinbayeva was born in a modest environment and remembers that her parents had to make many financial sacrifices in her early career [http://sport.guardian.co.uk/athletics/story/0,10082,1530393,00.html?gusrc=rss] [http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/Jan52006/sportscene15524200614.asp].

She has got a bachelor's degree after graduating from the Volgograd State Academy of Physical Culture, and is currently studying for her master's. In the Russian club competitions she represents the railroad military team, she is formally an officer in the Russian army, and on [[August 4]], [[2005]] she was given [http://lenta.ru/news/2005/08/04/isinbayeva/ military rank of senior lieutenant]. On her homepage, she states she is working to become a Physical Educator.

Isinbayeva states that she has a boyfriend of three years, a fellow pole vaulter whose name she doesn't reveal. She also acknowledges that she does not get along with her compatriot and rival [[Svetlana Feofanova]]. [http://sport.guardian.co.uk/athletics/story/0,10082,1530393,00.html?gusrc=rss]

She likes dolphins and Russian history. "I read a lot about Russian history, but I also love everything to do with dolphins, and collect small models of them. I have about 30 of them. My dream one day is to swim with real dolphins. I like them so much." [http://www.iaaf.org/GLE06/news/Kind=2/newsId=35239.html] Since recently, she writes on her homepage that she indeed now owns several of them. [http://www.yelenaisinbaeva.com/biography/]

In an interview with ''The Guardian'', Isinbayeva makes fun of the fact that female pole vaulters are seen as [[sex symbol]]s for "male couch potatoes", as their usual muscular, but slim build makes them highly attractive. In addition, she acknowledges that her rags-to-riches career, combined with her work ethic and sex symbol status, makes her somewhat similar to [[Maria Sharapova]]: "We [Sharapova and herself] are quite similar. Being famous sportswomen is not easy and her parents also sacrificed everything for her. And, like (Sharopova), the idea of being glamorous is very important to me. I always want to look like a girl. I don't agree that you are either a sportswoman or a girl. It's important that there are women who bring glamour to sport." Isinbayeva feels she could peak at 5.15m, and plans to jump at least until the Olympics of 2012. [http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/Jan52006/sportscene15524200614.asp], but since Moscow was elected hosts of the [[2013 World Championships in Athletics|2013 World Championships]], she has suggested she may continue until then.
