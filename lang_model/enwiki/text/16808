{{nihongo|'''''Buso Renkin'''''|<U+6B66><U+88C5><U+932C><U+91D1>|Bus<U+014D> Renkin|lit. "Arms Alchemy"|lead=yes}} is a [[manga]] series written and drawn by [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]]. It follows Kazuki Muto who becomes an alchemic warrior in the battle against alchemic monsters known as [[homunculi]]. It was serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Sh<U+014D>nen manga|sh<U+014D>nen]]'' magazine ''[[Weekly Sh<U+014D>nen Jump]]'' from June 2003 to April 2005. The individual chapters were collected by Shueisha into ten ''[[tank<U+014D>bon]]'' volumes. The series has been licensed by [[Viz Media]] for North American release.

The manga has been adapted into an [[anime]] television series produced by [[Xebec (studio)|Xebec]], which aired on Japan's TV Tokyo network from 2006 to 2007. In 2009, the series made its North American television debut on the [[Funimation Channel]]. The series has also spawned two [[drama CD]]s, two [[light novel]]s, and a [[PlayStation 2]] video game, and many types of ''Buso Renkin''-related merchandise.

In Japan, the ''Buso Renkin'' manga has sold over 3 million volumes {{as of|2007|lc=y}}. It also received a [[Seiun Award]] nomation. Publications for manga, anime and others have commented on it, which received assorted comments. Most of praise give by the reviewers is towards Watsuki's art, while negative response is directed to different aspects of the series. 

==Plot==
{{see also|List of Buso Renkin characters}}
The story begins when high school student Kazuki Muto is killed one night saving a mysterious girl from a monster, only to wake up in his school dorm, believing it to have been a dream. However, he soon finds out that dream wasn't a dream at all when a giant serpentine monster attacks him and his sister. Tokiko Tsumura, the girl he saved, explains that the monster is a [[homunculus]], an alchemical monster created when an embryo-like creation from a plant, animal, or even a human is placed inside a human. Kazuki had been attacked and killed by it when rescuing Tokiko. However she, feeling responsible for him, revived him by placing a {{nihongo|Kakugane|<U+6838><U+9244>}} medallion in his chest, serving as a replacement heart.

The Kakugane is an alchemical device that, when activated, takes a certain form based on the Kakugane's user will to fight, forming a unique Buso Renkin. The Buso Renkin is the only thing that can destroy a homunculus monster. Using this, Kazuki creates his own Buso Renkin, taking the form of a giant lance, later named Sunlight Heart. Along with Tokiko and her own Buso Renkin (the Valkyrie Skirt, an execution scythe), Kazuki joins the fight against the homunculi and their master, [[Koshaku Chono]].

==Production==
Nobuhiro Watsuki started writing ''Buso Renkin'' thinking it would be his last ''sh<U+014D>nen'' manga so he tried to do anything he could with that genre. Although he thought he would be good drawing its fights scenes, he still had troubles with them. He also remarks he "struggled with the comedic elements." During the series' publications, Watsuki had four severe colds, being so weak in the fourth one that he could not finish the chapter supposed to be sent to the ''[[Weekly Sh<U+014D>nen Jump]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Watsuki|first=Nobuhiro|title=Buso Renkin, Vol. 10|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|date=February 5, 2008|chapter=Afterward|pages=182<U+2013>183|isbn=1-4215-1542-3}}</ref>

Watsuki has drawn many references from films.
