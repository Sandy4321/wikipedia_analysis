'''''The Concert in Central Park''''' is a live album and also the concert of the same name by the American [[folk rock]] duo [[Simon & Garfunkel]] on September 19, 1981 in the [[Central Park]], New York. Both musicians performed a [[benefit concert]] as a contribution for the redevelopment of the rundown city park in the center of [[Manhattan]], on which more than half a million people attended. At the same time, this performance marked, after several years of their break-up, the temporary reunification of [[Paul Simon]] and [[Art Garfunkel]].

The album was released in the next year. It was highly praised by music critics and was commercially successful; the album peaked at number six of the ''Billboard'' 200 charts and was certified two-times multi-platinum. The video recordings of the concert initially ran in the American TV, but were later available for the home video market on different media.

== Idea and arrangement ==
=== Background ===
[[File:SimonandGarfunkel.jpg|thumb|right|Simon & Garfunkel auf einem Open-Air-Konzert in [[Dublin]]]]
During the [[1973 oil crisis]], the Central Park, New York's ''green liver'', turned into a bad condition. Only sparsely fostered due to lack of money, the greens of the former showpiece were partially rundown, cluttered with trash or demolished through vandalism. As the park was not protected well, the crime rate increased there strongly. The drug trade flourished, and due to the high number of violent crime walks in the park were regarded as insecure.<ref name="cphistory-1970">{{cite web | url= http://www.centralparkhistory.com/timeline/timeline_1970.html | work= centralparkhistory.com | title= The 1970s: The Fiscal Crisis | accessdate= December 12, 2011 }}</ref>{{sfn|Eliot|2010|p=171}} At the beginning of the 1980s the city lacked the fundings to renovate the city <U+2013> this alone costed about US$ 3 Million<ref name="cphistory-1970" /> <U+2013> and to permanently maintain, so that even its closure was reconsidered.<ref name="3sat">{{cite web | url= http://www.3sat.de/page/?source=/musik/158192/index.html |language=German| title= Simon & Garfunkel: The Concert in Central Park <U+2013> New York | hrsg= [[3sat]] | accessdate=December 12, 2011 }}</ref><ref name="gras-240">{{cite book | author= Mario Gras | title= New York State of Mind | publisher= BoD <U+2013> Books on Demand | year= 2011 | ISBN= 9783842351905 | page= 240 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=99rghgjRX6QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=New+York+State+of+Mind&hl=de&sa=X&ei=owyQT5mLJ8XTsgaj5oGjBA&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=New%20York%20State%20of%20Mind&f=false | accessdate=January 12, 2012 }}</ref> The [[Central Park Conservancy]] was founded to save the financing of the park.

=== A Concert for the Park ===

Around this time, Gordon Davis, who was responsible as a "Parks Commissioner" at the city administration of New York for the urban green areas, and Ron Delsener, one of the most influential concert promoters of New York, developed the idea to help the Central Park financially with a free open-air concert. The organisation earned from the revenues of bought T-shirts and other [[merchandising]] products by the Italian sportswear brand "Hirsch" about $US100,000. Further revenue came from the selling of television and video laws. Musicians [[Elton John]] and [[James Taylor]] have already proved with their two concerts, hosted by Warren Hirsh from ''Fiorucci and Hirsh Enterprises'', years earlier that this concept could be successful. After Davis permitted the project on behalf of the city, Delsener negotiated a contract with the television channel [[Home Box Office|HBO]] to rise the question which artists should perform.{{sfn|Eliot|2010|pp=171&nbsp;et seq}}{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=137}}

[[File:Simon undGarfunkel10-170.jpg|thumb|right|View from the audience to the stage]]
In the summer of 1981, Delsener phoned Paul Simon to present him the plan. Simon was keen on this idea, but questioned whether it would be successful, especially since his unsuccessful last project, the autobiographical movie ''[[One-Trick Pony (film)|One-Trick Pony]]'', despite being the director, the central character and the writer of its soundtrack. Furthermore, Simon's confidence declined and he visited a psychiatrist because of a depressive upset.{{sfn|Eliot|2010|pp=169 et seq}}<ref name="playboy">{{cite book | author= Tony Schwartz | title= The Playboy Interview | publisher= ''[[Playboy Magazine|Playboy]]'' | date= February 1984 | comment= Interview with Paul Simon; cited from {{cite web | url= http://willybrauch.de/In_Their_Own_Words/paulsimon1.htm | title= Playboy Interview : Paul Simon | accessdate=December 12, 2011 }} }}</ref> He questioned himself whether he could ask Art Garfunkel to participate. Under the name [[Simon & Garfunkel]] both were one of the most successful [[folk rock]] groups in in the 60s.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.billboard.com/artist/simon-garfunkel/5674#/artist/simon-garfunkel/bio/5674 | title= Simon & Garfunkel Biography | work= Online-Ausgabe von [[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]] | accessdate=March 1, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.allmusic.com/explore/essay/folk-rock-t538 | author= Richie Unterberger | title= Folk Rock | work= [[Allmusic]] | accessdate=March 1, 2012 }}</ref> Shortly after the release of their fifth studio album ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'', which is deemed to be their artisticial peak and which continuously topped the 1970 ''Billboard'' charts for two weeks, they announced their break-up. They have artistically grew apart and they did not get along well with each other. In the following eleven years, both continued their musical careers as solo artists and worked only spotty on single projects.<ref>{{cite web | author= Richie Unterberger | url= http://www.vocalgroup.org/inductees/simon_garfunkel.html | title= Simon & Garfunkel Biography | publisher= [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] | accessdate=March 1, 2012 }}</ref> Garfunkel made in the following years short guest appearances in the concerts of Simon, which were everytime successful. This time, Garfunkel's appearance would be bigger as before. Simon contacted him by phone, the latter of whom made at that time had a holiday in Switzerland. Garfunkel was excited about this idea and immediately returned to the USA.{{sfn|Eliot|2010|pp=171&nbsp;et seq}}{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=137}}

From the promoter's view, Simon and Garfunkel were the desired candidates. Not only because through their teamwork the concert could be the biggest in the history of the Central Park or in New York; Simon and Garfunkel showed sympathy to the city.{{sfn|Eliot|2010|pp=171&nbsp;et seq}} Both were raised in [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]], a district of the borough [[Queens]], and went to school there.<ref name="playboy" /><ref name="nyt-3">{{cite book | author= Douglas Martin | title= About New York; Just Simon in the Park, to Garfunkel's Disappointment | publisher= ''[[New York Times]]'' | date= August 14, 1991 | url= http://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/14/nyregion/about-new-york-just-simon-in-the-park-to-garfunkel-s-disappointment.html| accessdate=December 12, 2011 }}</ref> Unlike many other artists, both did not, according to music critic [[Stephen Holden]], leave the city behind.

=== Plannings and rehearsals ===

Around three months until the performance were needed to plan the procedure of the concert and to rehearse. Simon, who began to write songs after his long pause, interrupted their studio records for the preparations. He saw the chance to test one of the finished songs in front of a live audience. Garfunkel had similar intentions. Garfunkel intended to play the song "A Heart in New York" from his unfinished album ''[[Scissors Cut]]''.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=137}}

Around the time of the design of the stage programme, both realized that the performance would not work with Garfunkel as the supporter. As about the half of the concert would contain old Simon & Garfunkel songs, Simon's solo performance threatend an unintentional effect: "It didn't seem right to either of us that Paul should be the opening act for Simon & Garfunkel", said Garfunkel, "And for him to follow Simon & Garfunkel didn't make show-business sense"<ref>cited from {{cite book | author= Victoria Kingston | title= Simon & Garfunkel: The Biography | edition= 2. | publisher= Fromm International | year= 2000 | ISBN= 9780880642460 | pages= 236 }}</ref> Therefore they decided to perform the concert as a duo with solo performances of both musicians.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=137}}

During the plannings, there were disputes about how the evening would be organized. Garfunkel wanted a plain concert, like the duo's live performances in the mid-60s: only their voices, backed by Simon's [[acoustic guitar]]. Simon's scheduled songs, however, differed stilistically from their duo songs and were not only written for the guitar. For example, "Still Crazy After All These Years" was a piano song, "[[Late in the Evening]]" required [[Wind instrument|blowers]], different songs an [[electric guitar]]. Furthermore, Simon suffered from calcification of elastic fibers in one of his fingers caused by an injurance and those was unable to entertain the audience two hours long only with his guitar accompaniment. Garfunkel first agreed to hire a second guitarist but then rejected the idea. Simon grouped a backing band consisting of eleven musicians after his imagination.<ref name="playboy" />{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=138}} These were mainly studio musicians, many of whom played on the albums by Garfunkel and Simon: David Brown (guitar), [[Pete Carr]] (guitar), [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] ([[bass guitar]]), [[Rob Mounsey]] ([[synthesizer]]), [[John Eckert]] ([[trumpet]]), John Gatchell (trumpet), Dave Tofani ([[saxophone]]), [[Gerry Niewood]] (saxophone), [[Grady Tate]] ([[drums]], [[percussion]]), [[Steve Gadd]] (drums, percussion) and [[Richard Tee]] ([[Musical keyboard|keyboard]], piano).{{sfn|Eliot|2010|p=174}}

The concert's arrangements were written by Paul Simon and [[Dave Matthews|David Matthews]]. These partially differed significantly from the album versions, not only through a different lineup. For example, [[Latin music|Latin]] elements in "[[Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard]]" are finer worked out in the concert version and is empasized by a [[Salsa music|salsa]] [[Break (music)|break]]. The vivid folk rock song "[[Kodachrome (song)|Kodachrome]]" became a harder [[rock music|rock]] song, played as a [[medley (music)|medley]] alongside the [[Chuck Berry]] classic "[[Maybellene]]". "[[50 Ways to Leave Your Lover]]", in the studio version dominated by a rigorous, military rhythm, was altered into a [[Swing (jazz performance style)|swing]] Latin track including [[brass instrument|brass]].<ref name="rollingstone" />

Througout the rehearsal, which took place in an unoccupied theater in Manhattan,{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=137}} Garfunkel had worries. While he and Simon quickly retrieved the familiar songs, Garfunkel had to learn new arrangements. These were lyrics and melody of a few solo pieces by Simon, which were rewrote for the duet concert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/the-concert-in-central-park-r18004|publisher=Rovi Corporation|work=Allmusic|accessdate=April 18, 2012|title=The Concert in Central Park <U+2013> Simon & Garfunkel}}</ref> On the other hand, Simon rewrote the lyrics of many of their old songs, what was devasting for Garfunkel, as he had to adapt to them. Even if Garfunkel had to go oneself into an unusual musical style of Simon's songs, he enjoyed some of the songs and was glad to work with him on a duo version of Simon's "[[American Tune]]".{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=138}}

Overall, three weeks preparation time was characterized by tensions. Under time pressure, renowned differences between the musicians arrived. Paul Simon later described: "Well, the rehearsals were just miserable. Artie and I fought all the time."<ref name="playboy">{{cite book | author= Tony Schwartz | title= The Playboy Interview | publisher= ''[[Playboy Magazine|Playboy]]'' | date= February 1984 }}</ref>

=== Announcement ===

A few days after the concert it was kept secret that Simon and Garfunkel would perform together on stage.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=137}} Only then was the announcement published in several New York newspapers. Even though these reports<ref name="nyt-1">{{cite book | title= Simon and Garfunkel In Central Park Concert | publisher= ''[[New York Times]]'' | September 12, 1981 | url= http://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/12/arts/simon-and-garfunkel-in-central-park-concert.html | accessdate=December 12, 2011 }}</ref> as well as the posters designed by [[Michael Doret]]<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.michaeldoret.com/doret/artwork/simon.html | publisher= [[Michael Doret]] | title= Simon & Garfunkel. Concert in the Park | accessdate=January 10, 2012 }}</ref> named the names of the musicians seperated including their forenames without mentioning "Simon & Garfunkel", the event was quickly interpreted as their reunion. Seperatly, Simon & Garfunkel made interviews, in which they pointed to the fact that a further teamwork was not planned.{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=174}}{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=138 et seq}}

== The concert ==
=== Procedure ===
[[File:Simon and Garfunkel 10-146.jpg|thumb|right|The audience waits on the "Great Lawn" for the concert's beginning]]
The concert took place from September 19, 1981, Saturday, on the "Great Lawn", the central open space of the Central Park. First spectators came already in the daybreak of this day to secure a good place. Many brought provisions, chairs or picnic rugs.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=139}} The park administration awaited about 300,000 spectators.<ref name="nyt-1" /> Although it began to rain in the course of the days, which lasted until the beginning of the concert,<ref name="nyt-3" /> roughly 500,000 spectators came to the concert, more than, for example, in [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]].{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=174}} With that said, this concert is one of the most visited of all time; according to [[MTV]], only six surpassed this record.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://read.mtvhive.com/2011/09/19/hive-five-big-concerts-with-big-draws/ | author= Rebecca Raber | title= Hive Five: Big Concerts With Big Draws | work= [[MTV]] | date = September 19, 2011 | accessdate=December 12, 2011 }}</ref>

[[File:Ed Koch 1978.jpg|thumb|left|Mayor [[Ed Koch]] opened the concert (shot in 1978)]]
At the first crack of dawn, backing bands arrived the stage. The scenery reminded on an urban roof landscape with water reservoir and used air outlet, symbolical for New York's skyline. Shortly thereafter, New York's mayor [[Ed Koch]] went infront of a microphone to announce the beginning of the concert with the sentence, "Ladies and gentlemen, Simon and Garfunkel!"{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=139}} Under the applause of the audience, the duo came from a side door of the d<U+00E9>cor. When they arrived the middle of the stage, they quickly looked at each other and shook their hands.{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=174}} They then introduced the concert with the 1968 top-hit "[[Mrs. Robinson]]".

After the second song, ''[[Homeward Bound (song)|Homeward Bound]]'', Simon delivered a short speech, which he started with the words, "Well, it's great to do a neighborhood concert." Then he gave thanks to the police, the fire department, the park administration and finally to Ed Koch. Upon the mention of the latter's name, who was connected with the park's closure, the audience responded with boos. Only when Simon continuned, the ironical tone of the acknowledgment became visible, and the audience began to applaude.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.world66.com/northamerica/unitedstates/newyorkstate/newyork/sights/centralpark | title= Central Park | accessdate=February 24, 2012 }}</ref>

Simon & Garfunkel played overall twenty different songs; ten songs by the dio, eight by Simon, one by Garfunkel as well as "[[Wake Up Little Susie]]" by [[The Everly Brothers]]. Both singers presented each three songs for solo, including each new one. These were for Garfunkel the Simon & Garfunkel classic "[[Bridge over Troubled Water (song)|Bridge over Troubled Water]]" and "April Come She Will", as well as "A Heart in New York", written by [[Gallagher and Lyle]], from his album ''Scissor's Cut'' released one month before. Simon performed from his album ''[[Still Crazy After All These Years]]'' (1975) the title track and the number-one single "50 Ways to Leave Your Lover" without Garfunkel's backing, as well as his unreleased song "The Late Great Johnny Ace", which was included on his 1983 studio album ''[[Hearts and Bones]]''.

During his performance of this song he was briefly interrupted by a man from the audience, who ran to the stage and shouted to the singer: "I need to talk to you!" Simon backed a step away from him, while the security grabbed the disturber and carried him away, but Simon finished the song. The incident provoked associations to the song's lyrics, in which Simon speaks as a first-person narrator concerning the deaths of [[Johnny Ace]], [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[John Lennon]]. Lennon was murdered only a few hundreds meter from the stage.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|pp=140 et seq}}{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=175}} Despite this coherence Simon himself stated that he did not fear. He explaiend in May 1982 as a guest at the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' that it is not unusual that, for example, fans spring on the stage with flowers. For Simon the man appeared rather besotted. However, his first thought was that the song's premiere was ruined.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=141}}

Particular parts of songs, on which the lyrics refer to the city New York or the concert, it was met by the audience with scene applause, for example a line from Garfunkel's [[ode]] to his home city in "A Heart in New York", in which it describes from a returner's view the sight from a plain to the city and which also refers to the bad state of the Central Park:<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.centralparknyc.org/about/news/central-park-news/great-music-great-memories.html | title= Great Music, Great Memories <U+2013> Great Lawn | publisher= [[Central Park Conservancy]] | work= Official Website of New York City's Central Park | accessdate=February 27, 2012 }}</ref>

Another example was from the song "[[The Sounds of Silence]]", in which the narrative voice suddenly registers a large crowd of people in the dark:<ref name="cdstarts" />

After the ending of the 17th song, "[[The Boxer]]", which included a verse not included in the album version, Simon & Garfunkel thanked the audience and left the stage, but shortly afterwards briefly came back to deliver an encore from three songs <U+2013> "Old Friends / Bookends Theme", "The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)" and "The Sounds of Silence". Before the finishing song, Simon said that at this point it was planned to introduce pyrotechnics, but it was not allowed. On his invitation "Let's have our own fireworks!" many spectators held burning lighter to the top.<ref name="3sat" /> After Simon & Garfunkel again left the stage, they finally repeated as a further encore, "[[Late in the Evening]]", and before playing it they briefly introduced the member of the backing band.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=141}}

==Recording==

The audio recordings were [[Postproduction|reworked]] for the release as a music album, but these were not one-hundred percent perfect: According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', the records were not completely polished, but had the roar and the fuzziness of rock music, which were not signalized through a [[mix engineer|mixer]], but through [[loudspeaker]].<ref name="rollingstone" /> Two tracks were removed from the album version: ''The Late Great Johnny Ace'', on which Paul Simon was interrupted by a fan, and the repeat of "Late in the Evening" as an encore. The album was internationally commercially successful.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=145}} The album peaked at number six of the [[Billboard 200]] chart and sold over 2 million times and was awarded a 2&times;Multi-Platinum. The album was certified Diamond in France, selling more than 1,270,000 there. It was also successful in seven other countries.

=== Film editing ===

The concert was cinematically produced for the future release in television and in the home video market. [[Film director|Direction]] was headed by [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]], a specialist for music documenations, who worked on the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] film ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]''. As a [[Film producer|producer]] he worked with [[James Signorelli]].

The duo would continue to complement each other perfectly, despite their different style <U+2013> the romantic-sweetish pop musician Garfunkel and the gloomy, [[Rock 'n' Roll]]-leaning Simon. Several songs by Simon were clearly improved through the arrangements for the concert. The hand-picked backing band were "one of finest groups of musicians ever to play together at a New York rock concer."<ref>{{cite book | author= Stephen Holden | title= A 60's Sound Is Replayed To Perfection | publisher= ''[[New York Times]]'' | date= September 20 , 1981 }}</ref> In a few places, prominently in solo songs such as "Still Crazy After All These Years", Simon's voice felt a little thin, even after mixing, but that was "actually refreshing".<ref>{{cite book | author= Stephen Holden | title= Album Reviews: Simon & Garfunkel <U+2013> The Concert In Central Park | publisher= ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' | issue= 365 | date= March 18, 1982}}</ref> Simon & Garfunkel ran great risks to perform so many acoustic ballads under a cool air in an open-air concert. But just the smooth songs "were beautifully articulated, in near-perfect harmony."<ref>{{cite book | author= Stephen Holden | title= A 60's Sound Is Replayed To Perfection | publisher= ''[[New York Times]]'' | date= September 20, 1981}}</ref> ''New York Times'' overall concluded, "It was a wonderful concert."

These receptions can be generic for many other critics, who rated the concert as favourable. A contemporary reception in the ''Rolling Stone'' on October 1981 called it "one of the finest performances of [1981]." While Simon was an excellent vocalist, Garfunkel sang more restrained on very high passages as earlier, although he found fascinating [[harmony]]. "[T]he [<U+2026><!--twenty-two-song-->] show vividly recaptured another time, an era when well-crafted, melodic pop bore meanings that stretched beyond the musical sphere and into the realms of culture and politics."<ref>{{cite book | title= Simon and Garfunkel | publisher= ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' | issue= 355 | date= October 29, 1981}}</ref> Similarly was the reception of the music magazine ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' in March 1982, stating "This 19 song, two record set gloriously recaptures the past with sterling renditions of most of the duo's classics as well as a few of Simon's solo compositions filled out by Garfunkel's harmony. For those who grew up listening to Simon & Garfunkel this LP represents a trip down memory lane."<ref>{{cite book | title= Simon & Garfunkel <U+2013> The Concert in Central Park | publisher= [[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]] | date= March 6, 1982 | page= 73 }}</ref> 

Several critics criticized parts of the concerts. The contemporary reception of ''Rolling-Stone'' did not like the crossover from "Kodachrome" to "Maybelline", because none of the singers could raise the expressiveness for the rock songs. But this was "[t]he only gaffe of the evening."<ref>{{cite book | title= Simon and Garfunkel | publisher= ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' | issue= 355 | date= October 29, 1981 }}</ref>

== Aftermath ==
=== No union tours, no union album ===
{{See also|Simon %26 Garfunkel#Reunions|title1=Simon & Garfunkel after 1981}}

Immediately after the concert, Simon and Garfunkel were both initially disappointed; the latter explained it in an 1984 interview. Garfunkel was dissatisfied with his singing and he himself did not realized at the beginning the size of the concert : "I didn't get what had happened <U+2013> how big it was <U+2013> until I went home, turned on the television and saw it on all the news [<U+2026>] and later that night on the front pages of all the newspapers. Then I got it."<ref name="playboy" /> [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] released in November 1981 the compilation album ''[[The Simon and Garfunkel Collection]]''. It included the studio takes of 17 Simon & Garfunkel songs, including all songs of the duo until "April Come She Will", which were played during the concert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/the-simon-and-garfunkel-collection-17-of-their-all-time-greatest-recordings-r49394|publisher=Rovi Corporation|work=Allmusic|accessdate=April 19, 2012|title=The Simon and Garfunkel Collection: 17 of Their All-Time Greatest Recordings <U+2013> Simon & Garfunkel}}</ref>

After the concert, Simon & Garfunkel went in May 1982 on a world tournee with stations in Japan, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Netherlands, Ireland, France, Great Britain, New Zealand, the USA and Kanada.{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=178}} Their first arrival in Europe was in [[Offenbach am Main]] on May 28, 1982 in the [[Stadion am Bieberer Berg]] in front of around 40,000 spectators, their first concert in Germany.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=145 et seq}}

[[File:Simon and Garfunkel.jpg|thumb|right|Simon & Garfunkel in a joint concert in 2009]]
During the tournee breaks, Simon & Garfunkel went to a studio to record a duo album, which should include track which were not finished due to the Central Park concert. Throughout the concert travels they presented the first completed songs, but they did not continued to work on the album because of increasing personal tensions between Garfunkel and Simon. Disputes between them often occurred, and sometimes they were not even ready to make interviews.{{sfn|Ebel|2004|p=145 et seq}} After the end of the tournee, Simon & Garfunkel did not resumed their teamwork as a duo. Over a long period of time they both performed for single concerts at best. When Simon again performed in a free concert at the same place as he did ten years before in the Central Park, he refused Garfunkel's offer to participate as a member of the duo.<ref name="nyt-3" /> They went on tour as a duo again in 2003.<ref>{{cite book | author= Ray Waddel | title= Friends Again. Simon and Garfunkel Reunite For Tour | publisher= [[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]| date= September 20, 2003 | pages= 6, 79 }}</ref>

=== Preservation of the Central Park ===
Simon & Garfunkel's ''Concert in Central Park'' brought around US$51,000 to the Central Park.<ref name="pileggi-32" /> Beside Simon & Garfunkel other musicians contributed with benefical concerts and raised the attention for its financial distress. These could mostly eliminated with the help of private financier.<ref>{{cite book | author= Elizabeth Barlow | title= Central Park's Renaissance | publisher= ''[[New York Magazine]]'' | date= June 6, 1983 | pages= 32&nbsp;et seq | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=s8EBAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA32&dq=Central+Park%E2%80%99s+Renaissance&hl=de&sa=X&ei=sgKQT_3OIMXMsgaE7_SuBA&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Central%20Park%E2%80%99s%20Renaissance&f=false | accessdate=January 12, 2012 }}</ref> In the course of the 1980s, the park was comprehensively repaired and is today considered as a sight.<ref name="gras-240" /><ref name="cph-80er" /> Donations make up the majority of its budget.<ref name="newyork.ch">{{cite web | url= http://www.newyork.ch/central-park/ | title= Central Park | accessdate=December 12, 2011 }}</ref> Today there are still regular concerts and other benefical events.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.centralparknyc.org/about/ | title= About the Central Park Conservancy | publisher= [[Central Park Conservancy]] | accessdate=December 14, 2011 }}</ref>
