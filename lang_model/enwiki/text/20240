Then, in 1989, Hawke made his breakthrough appearance, playing shy student Todd Anderson opposite [[Robin Williams]]'s inspirational English teacher in ''[[Dead Poets Society]]''.<ref name="actors"/> The film was critically well-received;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/deadpoetssociety/|title=Dead Poets Society (1989): Reviews|date=1989-06-02|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> the ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reviewer wrote "Hawke&nbsp;... gives a haunting performance."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790298.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|title=Dead Poets Society Review|date=1989-01-01|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> With revenue of $235&nbsp;million worldwide, the film remains Hawke's most commercially successful picture to date.<ref name="earnings">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Actor&id=ethanhawke.htm|title=Ethan Hawke Movie Box Office Results|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> Hawke later described the opportunities he was offered as a result of the film's success as critical to his decision to continue acting: "I didn't want to be an actor and I went back to college.

Hawke's next film, 1991's ''[[White Fang (1991 film)|White Fang]]'', part brought his first leading role. The film, an adaptation of [[Jack London]]'s [[White Fang|novel of the same name]], featured Hawke as Jack Conroy, a [[Yukon]] gold hunter who befriends a [[wolfdog]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20166788,00.html|title=White Fang|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|date=2007-12-17|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> According to the ''[[The Oregonian]]'', "Hawke does a good job as young Jack, being both physically robust but still boyishly naive.

The following year Hawke again received critical praise, this time for his performance in [[Richard Linklater]]'s 1995 drama ''[[Before Sunrise]]''.

Hawke said of the novel, "Writing the book had to do with dropping out of college, and with being an actor. I didn't want my whole life to go by and not do anything but recite lines. I wanted to try making something else. It was definitely the scariest thing I ever did. And it was just one of the best things I ever did."<ref name="sunrise"/> The book received mostly negative reviews. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said that Hawke "opens himself to rough literary scrutiny in ''The Hottest State''.
