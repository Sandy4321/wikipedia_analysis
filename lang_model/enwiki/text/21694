'''''Peresvet''''' ({{lang-ru|<U+041F><U+0435><U+0440><U+0435><U+0441><U+0432><U+0435><U+0442>}}) was the [[lead ship]] of the three {{sclass-|Peresvet|battleship|0}} [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] at the end of the nineteenth century. The ship was transferred to the [[Russian Pacific Fleet|Pacific Squadron]] upon completion and based at [[L<U+00FC>shunkou District|Port Arthur]] from 1903. During the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904<U+2013>05, she participated in the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] and was seriously damaged during the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]] and again in the [[Siege of Port Arthur]]. The ship was [[scuttled]] before the Russians surrendered, then [[marine salvage|salvaged]] by the Japanese and placed into service with the name {{nihongo|''Sagami''|<U+76F8><U+6A21>|}}.

Partially rearmed, ''Sagami'' was reclassified by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) as a [[coastal defense ship]] in 1912. In 1916, the Japanese sold her to the Russians, their allies since the beginning of [[World War I]]. En route to the [[White Sea]] in early 1917, she sank off [[Port Said]], Egypt, after striking [[naval mine|mines]] laid by a [[Imperial German Navy|German]] [[submarine]].

==Design and description==
The design of the ''Peresvet'' class was inspired by the [[Royal Navy|British]] second-class battleships of the {{sclass|Centurion|battleship|4}}. The British ships were intended to defeat commerce-raiding [[armored cruiser]]s like the Russian ships {{ship|Russian cruiser|Rossia||2}} and {{ship|Russian cruiser|Rurik|1892|2}}, and the ''Peresvet'' class was designed to support the Russian armored cruisers. This role placed a premium on high speed and long range at the expense of heavy armament and armor.<ref name=m8>McLaughlin 2003, p. 108</ref>

''Peresvet'' was {{convert|434|ft|5|in|m|1}} [[length overall|long overall]], and had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|71|ft|6|in|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|26|ft|3|in|m|1}}. Designed to displace {{convert|12674|LT|t|lk=in}}, she was almost {{convert|1200|LT|t|0}} overweight and displaced {{convert|13810|LT|t}}. Her crew consisted of 27 officers and 744 enlisted men. The ship was powered by three [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]] using steam generated by 30 [[Belleville boiler]]s. The engines were rated at {{convert|14500|ihp|lk=in}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|18|kn|lk=in}}. ''Peresvet'', however, reached a top speed of {{convert|18.44|kn}} from {{convert|14532|ihp}} during her [[sea trial]]s in November 1899. She carried a maximum of {{convert|2060|LT|t}} of coal, which allowed her to steam for {{convert|6200|lk=in|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref>McLaughlin 2003, pp. 107<U+2013>08, 114</ref>

The ship's [[main battery]] consisted of four {{convert|10|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns mounted in two twin-[[gun turret]]s, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. The [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary armament]] consisted of eleven [[Canet guns|Canet]] {{convert|6|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF) gun]]s, mounted in [[casemate]]s on the sides of the hull and in the bow, underneath the [[forecastle]]. Several smaller guns were carried for defense against [[torpedo boat]]s. These included twenty {{convert|75|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} QF guns, twenty {{convert|47|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun]]s and eight {{convert|37|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} guns. She was also armed with five {{convert|15|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s, three above water and two submerged. The ship carried 45 [[Naval mine|mines]] to be used to protect her anchorage. ''Peresvet''{{'}}s [[waterline]] [[belt armor|armor belt]] consisted of [[Harvey armor]] and was {{convert|4|-|9|in|0}} thick. The [[Krupp cemented armor]] of her gun turrets had a maximum thickness of {{convert|9|in|mm|0}} and her [[deck (ship)|deck]] ranged from {{convert|2|to|3|in|0}} in thickness.<ref>McLaughlin 2003, pp. 107<U+2013>08, 112<U+2013>14</ref>

==Construction and service==
''Peresvet'' was named after [[Alexander Peresvet]], a Russian Orthodox monk who fought and died at the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] in 1380, against a Mongolian army. Her [[keel]] was [[laid down]] on 21 November 1895 by the [[Baltic Shipyard|Baltic Works]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] and she [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 19 May 1898.<ref>McLaughlin 2003, pp. 107, 115</ref> She was not completed, however, until July 1901,<ref>Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 182</ref> at the cost of 10,540,000 [[rubles]].<ref>McLaughlin 2003, p. 112</ref> ''Peresvet'' entered service in August,<ref name=m354>McLaughlin 2008, p. 45</ref> and was sent to Port Arthur in October 1901.<ref name=m5/> En route, she [[Ship grounding|ran aground]] on the tip of [[Langeland]] Island while passing through the Danish [[Great Belt]] on 1 November, but was apparently not seriously damaged.<ref name=m354/> Upon arrival she was assigned to the Pacific Squadron and became the [[flagship]] of the squadron's second-in-command, [[Rear Admiral]] Prince [[Pavel Ukhtomsky]].<ref name=m5>McLaughlin 2003, p. 115</ref>

===Battle of Port Arthur===
{{main|Battle of Port Arthur}}

After the Japanese victory in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894<U+2013>95, tensions had arisen between Russia and Japan over their ambitions to control both [[Manchuria]] and Korea. A further issue was the Russian failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903 as promised. Japan had begun negotiations to ease the situation in 1901, but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems. Japan interpreted these as deliberate prevarications designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs. The final straws were news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea. These led the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was now inevitable. The Pacific Squadron began [[wikt:moor|mooring]] in the outer harbor at night as tensions with Japan increased, in order to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea.<ref>Westwood, pp. 15<U+2013>21</ref>

On the night of 8/9 February 1904, the IJN launched a [[Battle of Port Arthur|surprise attack]] on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur. ''Peresvet'' was not hit by the initial torpedo-boat incursion and [[sortie]]d the following morning when the [[Combined Fleet]], commanded by [[Vice Admiral]] [[T<U+014D>g<U+014D> Heihachir<U+014D>]], attacked. T<U+014D>g<U+014D> had expected the surprise night attack by his ships to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his assault. The Japanese vessels were spotted by the [[protected cruiser]] {{ship|Russian cruiser|Boyarin|1901|2}}, which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defenses. T<U+014D>g<U+014D> chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese {{convert|8|in|0|adj=on|sp=in}} and six-inch guns inflicted inconsequential damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on their opponents with some effect.<ref>Forczyk, pp. 41<U+2013>43</ref> ''Peresvet'' was hit three times with little effect during the battle.<ref name=m354/>

On 22 March, ''Peresvet'' joined several other battleships firing indirectly at Japanese ships bombarding Port Arthur's harbor. While training outside Port Arthur on 26 March, she accidentally collided with the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Sevastopol|1895|2}} and sustained minor damage. ''Peresvet'' participated in the action of 13 April, when T<U+014D>g<U+014D> successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including Vice Admiral [[Stepan Makarov]]'s flagship, the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Petropavlovsk|1897|2}}. When Makarov spotted the five Japanese battleships, he turned back for Port Arthur and ''Petropavlovsk'' struck a minefield laid by the Japanese the previous night. The ship sank in less than two minutes following the explosion of one of her [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s, and Makarov was one of the 677 killed. Emboldened by his success, T<U+014D>g<U+014D> resumed long-range bombardment missions.<ref>Forczyk, pp. 45<U+2013>46</ref> Two days later, ''Peresvet'' hit the armored cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Nisshin||2}} once as the latter ship was bombarding Port Arthur.<ref name=m354/>

''Peresvet'' sailed with the rest of the Pacific Squadron on 23 June in an abortive attempt to reach [[Vladivostok]]. The new squadron commander, Rear Admiral [[Wilgelm Vitgeft]], ordered the squadron to return to Port Arthur when it encountered the Japanese fleet shortly before sunset, as he did not wish to engage his numerically superior opponents in a night battle.<ref>Warner & Warner, pp. 305<U+2013>06</ref> ''Peresvet'' bombarded Japanese positions besieging the port on 28 July.<ref>McLaughlin 2008, pp. 45<U+2013>46</ref> Some of the ship's guns were removed during the summer to reinforce the defenses of the port. ''Peresvet'' lost a total of three 6-inch, two 75-millimeter, two 47-millimeter and four 37-millimeter guns.<ref name=m53>McLaughlin 2003, pp. 115, 163</ref> She was hit on 9 August by two {{convert|4.7|in|adj=on}} shells fired by a battery with a narrow view of the harbor, but they caused only slight damage.<ref name=m46>McLaughlin 2008, p. 46</ref>

===Battle of the Yellow Sea===
{{main|Battle of the Yellow Sea}}
[[File:Peresviet Port Arthur LOC 3f06353u.jpg|thumb|left|''Peresvet'' after having been scuttled]]
The Japanese bombardment, coupled with a direct order from [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], forced Vitgeft to make an attempt to reach Vladivostok. The squadron sortied in an attempt to escape to Vladivostok in the morning of 10 August. At 12:25, it was spotted by Japanese cruisers and intercepted by the Combined Fleet in what became the Battle of the Yellow Sea. ''Peresvet'' was fourth in line during the battle,<ref>Forczyk, p. 48</ref> and was not seriously damaged during the early long-range stage of the action. Around 18:00 her topmasts were destroyed and two 12-inch shells from the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Asahi||2}} penetrated the conning tower of the Russian flagship {{ship|Russian battleship|Tsesarevich||2}}, killing Vitgeft and the helmsman, severely wounding the [[captain (nautical)|captain]], and causing the ship to come to a dead stop after executing a sharp turn. Thinking that this was a maneuver planned by Vitgeft, the Russian [[battleline]] started to execute the same turn, causing all of the ships directly behind ''Tsesarevich'', including ''Peresvet'', to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting the stationary flagship.<ref name=m63/>

As the Japanese ships continued to pound the ''Tsesarevich'', the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Retvizan||2}}, followed shortly afterward by ''Peresvet'', boldly charged T<U+014D>g<U+014D>'s battleline in an attempt to divert the Japanese shellfire. The Japanese battleline immediately shifted fire to the oncoming ships, badly damaging both and forcing them to turn away.<ref name=m63>McLaughlin 2003, p. 163</ref> Ukhtomsky signaled the other Russian ships to follow him back to Port Arthur, but the signal was hard to discern because the flags had to be hung from the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] railings without the topmasts and were only gradually recognized.<ref name=m46/> ''Peresvet'' received a total of 39 hits of all sizes<ref name=m63/> that killed 13 men and wounded 69. Her forward 12-inch turret was knocked out and several hits near the waterline caused flooding; compartments of the double bottom had to be counterflooded to restore some of her stability. Repairs took until late September.<ref name=m46/>

===Siege of Port Arthur===
{{main|Siege of Port Arthur}}
Returning to Port Arthur on 11 August, the Russian squadron found the city still under siege by the [[Japanese Third Army]] led by [[Baron]] [[Nogi Maresuke]]. The new commander, Rear Admiral [[Robert N. Viren]], decided to use the men and guns of the Pacific Squadron to reinforce the defenses of Port Arthur and even more guns were stripped from the squadron's ships. On 20<U+2013>22 September Japanese troops attacked [[203 Hill]], which overlooked the harbor; ''Peresvet'', ''Retvizan'', the battleship ''Poltava'' and the [[gunboat]] {{ship|Russian gunboat|Bobr||2}} bombarded the Japanese positions to support the successful defense of the hill. The Japanese began firing blindly into the harbor on 30 September and hit ''Peresvet'' with at least six {{convert|5.9|in|adj=on}} and 4.7-inch shells. She was struck once more the following day. On 2 October she was hit by nine {{convert|11|in|adj=on}} shells that failed to penetrate her deck armor, but did considerable damage to the unprotected portions of the ship. The Japanese troops were able to seize Hill 203 on 5 December. This allowed the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s [[siege gun]]s to fire directly at the Russian ships and they hit ''Peresvet'' many times. The Russians scuttled her in shallow water on 7 December 1904 without, however, seriously damaging her, possibly in the hope of fooling the Japanese into switching targets.<ref name=m46/>

===Japanese career===
[[File:Sagami1908YokohamaI01491.jpg|thumb|left|''Sagami'' (center, rear) at anchor in [[Yokohama]] harbor during the [[Great White Fleet]]'s visit, September 1908]]
''Peresvet'' was refloated by Japanese engineers on 29 June 1905 and steamed under her own power to Sasebo Naval Arsenal, where she arrived on 25 August. She was renamed ''Sagami'',<ref name=l4>Lengerer, p. 44</ref> after the eponymous [[Sagami Province|ancient province]].<ref name=s7>Silverstone, p. 336</ref> She was classified as a 1st-class battleship on 25 August and arrived at [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] on 16 September. Her repairs began on 30 September and continued until 20 July 1908, although she participated in the review of captured ships on 23 October 1905.<ref name=l4/>

To improve her stability, ''Sagami''{{'}}s forward [[Top (sailing ship)|fighting top]] was removed. The bow six-inch gun was also removed and all of her light guns were replaced by 20 [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|QF 12-pounder 12 cwt]]<ref group=Note>"Cwt" is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.</ref> guns. Two above-water [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch]] torpedo tubes replaced her original torpedo armament and her crew now numbered 791 officers and enlisted men. She was one of the reception ships when the American [[Great White Fleet]] visited Japan in late 1908 and was often used as an "enemy" ship during the annual fleet maneuvers. ''Sagami'' was reclassified as a 1st-class coastal defense ship on 28 August 1912.<ref>Lengerer, pp. 43<U+2013>44</ref>

===Return to Russia===
In 1916 the Russian government decided to reinforce its naval strength outside the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea]]s. As Japan and Russia were allies during [[World War I]], the Japanese government sold ''Sagami'' and some other ex-Russian warships back to Russia in March. She arrived in Vladivostok on 3 April, where she re-assumed her former name of ''Peresvet'', and was classified as an armored cruiser two days later.<ref>McLaughlin 2008, pp. 47, 55</ref> The ship ran aground on 23 May while conducting trials and was refloated by the IJN on 9 July. ''Peresvet'' arrived at [[Maizuru Naval Arsenal]] for repairs on 30 July and sailed for European Russia on 18 October.<ref name=l4/> She was intended to serve with the [[White Sea Fleet]] and paused en route in Port Said for machinery repairs at the beginning of 1917. On 4 January 1917, about {{convert|10|nmi}} north of the harbor, the ship struck two mines that had been laid by the submarine {{SMU|U-73||6}}. Holed forward and abreast one of her boiler rooms, ''Peresvet'' sank after catching fire. Losses were reported as either 167<ref>Preston, p. 207</ref> or 116 men.<ref name=m5/>
