==Life==
Sheila Brown was born circa 1940 in the [[Lajamanu, Northern Territory|Lajamanu]] region of the [[Northern Territory]],<ref name="Birnberg212">{{cite book|last=Birnberg|first=Margo|coauthors=Janusz Kreczmanski|title=Aboriginal Artist Dictionary of Biographies: Australian Western, Central Desert and Kimberley Region|publisher=J.B.

The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians operate using a different conception of time, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events.<ref name="BirnbergIntro">{{cite book|last=Birnberg|first=Margo|coauthors=Janusz Kreczmanski|title=Aboriginal Artist Dictionary of Biographies: Australian Western, Central Desert and Kimberley Region|publisher=J.B.

'[[Napaljarri (skin name)|Napaljarri]]' (in Warlpiri) or 'Napaltjarri' (in Western Desert dialects) is a [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|skin name]], one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the [[kinship system]] of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans.<ref name="CLC">{{cite web|url=http://www.clc.org.au/People_Culture/kinship/kinship.html|title=Kinship and skin names|work=People and culture|publisher=Central Land Council|accessdate=2009-10-23}}</ref><ref name="de Brabander">{{cite book|last=De Brabander|first=Dallas|title=[[Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia]]|editor=David Horton|publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|location=Canberra|date=1994|volume=2|page=977|chapter=Sections|isbn=9780855752347}}</ref> Thus 'Sheila Brown' is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers.

===Background===
Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began when Indigenous men at [[Papunya]] began painting in 1971, assisted by teacher [[Geoffrey Bardon]].<ref name="Bardon">{{cite book|last=Bardon|first=Geoffrey|coauthors=James Bardon|title=Papunya <U+2013> A place made after the story: The beginnings of the Western Desert painting movement|publisher=Miegunyah Press|location=University of Melbourne|date=2006}}</ref> Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983.<ref name="Dussart06">{{cite journal|last=Dussart|first=Francoise|date=2006|title=Canvassing identities: reflecting on the acrylic art movement in an Australian Aboriginal settlement|journal=Aboriginal History|volume=30|pages=156<U+2013>168}}</ref> By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally.<ref name="Morphy99">{{cite book|last=Morphy|first=Howard|title=Aboriginal Art|publisher=Phaidon|location=London|date=1999|pages=261<U+2013>316}}</ref> The first artists, including all of the founders of the [[Papunya Tula]] artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting.<ref name="Strocchi06">{{cite journal|last=Strocchi|first=Marina|date=2006|title=Minyma Tjukurrpa: Kintore / Haasts Bluff Canvas Project: Dancing women to famous painters|journal=Artlink|volume=26|issue=4}}</ref> However, there was also a desire amongst many of the women to participate, and in the 1990s large numbers of them began to create paintings. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the [[outstation movement|outstations]], people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale.<ref name="Morphy99"/>
