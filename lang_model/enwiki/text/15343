'''''Dendrite International, Inc. v. Doe No. 3''''', [[Case citation|A-2774-00T3]] (2001), is a [[New Jersey Superior Court]] case in which Dendrite International, Inc., a purveyor of computer software used in the pharmaceutical industry, brought a [[Doe subpoena|John Doe]] [[lawsuit]] against individuals who had [[Anonymous post|anonymously posted]] criticisms of the company on a [[Yahoo]] [[message board]]. When Presiding Chancery Judge Kenneth MacKenzie rejected one of Dendrite's requests to compel [[Yahoo]] to [[Doe subpoena|reveal the identity]] of an anonymous defendant, Dendrite appealed. The appellate court upheld the district court's decision, and in doing so, created a set of guidelines for determining the circumstances under which an anonymous online speaker may be unmasked.<ref name=decision>[http://pub.bna.com/eclr/277400t3.htm 775 A.2d 756] (N.J.

== Background ==

No uniform standard exists in the United States for determining the circumstances under which an anonymous online speaker may be unmasked.<ref name=miller>Miller, Jason. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1365326 Who's Exposing John Doe] Journal of Technology Law & Policy, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2008</ref> 

The original Superior Court case, ''Dendrite International, Inc. v. Does'', was a lawsuit brought by Dendrite International, Inc. (since acquired by [[Cegedim]]),<ref>[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070504005752/en/Dendrites-Shareholders-Approve-Acquisition-Cegedim Business Wire]. Dendrite's Shareholders Approve Acquisition by Cegedim. Retrieved on 2011-03-01.</ref> a company that provided pharmaceutical-industry-specific [[customer relationship management]] software, against fourteen anonymous defendants. These individuals had posted messages on a [[Yahoo]] [[message board]] which Dendrite claimed were [[breach of contract|breaches of contract]], were [[defamatory]] and contained [[trade secrets]].

The [[plaintiffs]] requested that the court reveal the identity of four of the Does.<ref name=USAT>Bartlett, Michael, [http://www.usatoday.com/tech/nb/nb3.htm Court Upholds Anonymous Net Posting Decision], USA Today. Retrieved on 2009-03-15.</ref> However, unlike judges in previous similar cases, the trial judge ordered that a notice be posted on the message board alerting the Does that Dendrite was [[subpoena]]ing [[Yahoo]], enabling some of the Does to contest the action.<ref name=NJSL>Saitz, Greg. "[http://fhdlaw.com/html/articles/Star-Ledger-Walking_a_fine_line_on_cyber_rights.htm Walking a Fine Line on Cyber Rights]." New Jersey Star-Ledger. Retrieved on 2011-03-01.</ref> In November 2000, the trial judge granted the company's motion to conduct limited [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] to ascertain the identities of Does No. 1 and 2, but denied access to Does 3 and 4.<ref name=USAT />

Doe No. 3's comments were related to alleged changes in the company's accounting practices and discussed the CEO's unsuccessful attempts to sell the company. The trial judge felt that Dendrite had failed to prove that it was harmed by the allegations, and found that the conduct of Does No. 3 and 4 did not warrant the revocation of their constitutional protections.<ref name=USAT /> Dendrite appealed the decision with respect to Doe No. 3.

== Opinion ==

The appellate court affirmed the lower court's opinion, finding that Dendrite's [[prima facie]] case did not merit the unmasking of Doe No. 3. The panel cited cases ruling that constitutional free speech protections extend to anonymous or pseudonymous comments made online, and stated that in order for Doe No. 3 to forfeit those protections, Dendrite had to demonstrate that the statements were [[defamatory]] in that they were both false and harmful. The court felt that Dendrite had not met these criteria. In measuring harm, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's use of the price of company shares on the [[stock market]] in the time period following the posting of the comments.<ref name=USAT />

In making a decision with regards to Doe No. 3, the court set forth five guidelines for judges to follow in future cases when deciding whether to compel disclosure of an anonymous poster's identity: (1) the [[plaintiff]] must make good faith efforts to notify the poster and give the poster a reasonable opportunity to respond; (2) the plaintiff must specifically identify the poster's allegedly actionable statements; (3) the complaint must set forth a [[prima facie]] cause of action; (4) the plaintiff must support each element of the claim with sufficient evidence; and (5) "the court must balance the defendant's First Amendment right of anonymous free speech against the strength of the [[prima facie]] case presented and the necessity for the disclosure of the anonymous defendant's identity."<ref name=decision /> Dendrite's claim was rejected because it failed to produce adequate evidence of the harm element of the defamation claim for the fourth guideline.

These guidelines build upon the [[Doe_subpoena#Summary_judgment_standard|summary judgment standard]], but provide additional protection in that they allow the court to "balance" the defendant's rights against the strength of the plaintiff's [[prima facie]] case.<ref name=USAT /> The standard set by this case has been applied to several others, some in states other than New Jersey,<ref name=miller /> including Indiana.<ref name="Techdirt Indiana">[http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120224/02092517861/indiana-court-says-anonymous-commenters-deserve-high-standard-before-being-exposed-arent-necessarily-protected-shield-laws.shtml Techdirt: Indiana Court Says Anonymous Commenters Deserve High Standard Before Being Exposed, But Aren't Necessarily Protected By Shield Laws]</ref>
