Tzavelas played a leading role in the [[Greek War of Independence]] in [[1821]], alongside [[Georgios Karaiskakis]], distinguishing himself especially during the siege of [[Messolonghi]].

After indepedence, Tzavelas became a supporter of Kapodistria and eventually a leader in the [[Russian Party (Greece)|Russian Party]] which was the conservative and arch-[[Orthodox]] political faction in the period of King [[Otto of Greece|Otto]]. Accused of planning a revolt against the king in [[1834]], Tzavelas was imprisoned by the Regency Council head by [[Josef Ludwig von Armansperg|von Armansperg]] along with other politicians of the Russian Party. When King Otto reached the age of majority and took over the reigns of government, Tzavelas was released and later was named aide-de-camp to the king. He was subsequently appointed Minister of War in [[1844]] and, in [[1847]]-[[1848]], Prime Minister. Kitsos Tzavelas died on [[March 21]], [[1855]].
