He played [[college football]] as a [[quarterback]] at the [[University of Alabama]] from 1962 to 1965 and then played for two seasons in the [[National Football League]] with the [[Atlanta Falcons]] (1966<U+2013>1967).  Sloan served as the head football coach at [[Vanderbilt University]] (1973<U+2013>1974), [[Texas Tech University]] (1975<U+2013>1977), the [[University of Mississippi]] (1978<U+2013>1982), and [[Duke University]] (1983<U+2013>1986), compiling a career record of 68<U+2013>86<U+2013>3. He also served as the [[athletic director]] at the University of Alabama, the [[University of North Texas]], [[University of Central Florida]], and the [[University of Tennessee at Chattanooga]] before his retirement in 2006.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://media.www.utcecho.com/media/storage/paper483/news/2006/02/09/News/Athletic.Director.Retires-1606432.shtml| title=Athletic director retires| publisher=The University Echo Online| date=2006-02-09| accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref>  In 2000, Sloan was inducted into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame.<ref name="VU-history">{{cite web| url=http://vucommodores.cstv.com/ot/history-corner-092006.html| title=The Commodore history corner| publisher=Vanderbilt University| author=Traughber, Bill| date=2006-09-20| accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref>

==Playing career==
Sloan played [[college football]] at the [[University of Alabama]] under legendary coach [[Bear Bryant|Paul "Bear" Bryant]] between 1962<U+2013>1965.  He arrived in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] in 1962, though was not eligible to play with the [[varsity team|varsity]] team due to [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] rules at the time. In his sophomore season, Sloan was a backup to [[quarterback]] [[Joe Namath]], but played in most games at [[defensive back]].  Sloan quarterbacked the Tide's final regular season game and the [[1964 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] when Bryant benched Namath for disciplinary reasons.<ref name="VU-history" /> The [[1963 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1963 Crimson Tide]] went 9<U+2013>2 with a 12<U+2013>7 victory over [[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]] in the Sugar Bowl.

Sloan was the primary quarterback in his junior season in 1964 while Namath was injured. The [[1964 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1964 team]] finished 10<U+2013>1, won the [[Southeastern Conference]] title, and was named the consensus [[NCAA Division I FBS national football championship|national champion]].  However, in the [[Orange Bowl|1965 Orange Bowl]] versus [[1964 Texas Longhorns football team|Texas]], Sloan was forced out of the game with injury.  Namath came off the bench to win MVP honors despite Alabama losing, 21<U+2013>17.<ref>{{cite news| title=NO. 1 TEAM HALTED ON ONE-FOOT LINE; Koy Scores Twice, Once on 79-Yard Dash -- Namath Is Brilliant in Defeat| publisher=''New York Times''| date=1965-01-02}}</ref>

Following the departure of Namath to the [[American Football League]], Sloan became Alabama's full-time starter for the [[1965 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1965 season]],<ref name="VU-history" /><ref>{{cite web | title =  University of Alabama official team statistics, 1965 | url = http://grfx.cstv.com/schools/alab/graphics/docs/65-m-footbl-stats.pdf | accessdate = 2010-05-02}}</ref> in which Alabama repeated as SEC and national champions. The team finished 9<U+2013>1<U+2013>1 with a 39<U+2013>28 victory over [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] in the [[1966 Orange Bowl]].

After college, Sloan was selected by the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Atlanta Falcons]] in the 11th round of the [[1966 NFL Draft]].  He played sparingly as a back-up over the course of two seasons.  In his brief NFL career, he only appeared in eight games, and only one as a starter.  During those eight games, he completed 10 of 31 passes, for no touchdowns and four interceptions.<ref>{{cite web | title = Steve Sloan | work = pro-football-reference.com | url = http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SloaSt00.htm | accessdate = 2010-05-02}}</ref>

==Coaching career==
In 1971, Sloan received his first coaching job as an [[offensive coordinator]] for the [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State Seminoles]].<ref name="Sloan-long-road">{{cite news| title=Sloan: taking the long road back to Alabama?| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QekLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ylkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4947,4325857| author=Holliman, Steve| publisher=''St. Petersburg Times''| date=1977-12-21| pages=C1}}</ref> The following year, he moved to the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] for the same position.<ref name="Sloan-long-road" />

In 1973, Sloan took his first job as a head coach of the [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt Commodores]].<ref>{{cite news| title=Vanderbilt names Sloan head coach| publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''| date=1973-02-15| pages=H4}}</ref> In his first season, Vanderbilt finished at 5<U+2013>6, including a 1<U+2013>6 record in conference play. During his second season, however, Vanderbilt finished at 7<U+2013>3<U+2013>1 and qualified for a post-season [[bowl game]]. The team was placed in the [[1974 Peach Bowl|Peach Bowl]] against the [[1974 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team|Texas Tech Red Raiders]].<ref>{{cite news| title=Vanderbilt is named to play in Peach Bowl| publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''| date=1974-11-08| pages=D3}}</ref> The two teams played to a 6<U+2013>6 tie in the game.<ref>{{cite news| title=Vandy's defense stiffens for tie in Peach Bowl| publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]''| date=1974-12-29| pages=B9}}</ref> It was Vanderbilt's first bowl game since 1955 and second in school history.

The [[Texas Tech University]] athletic department offered Sloan head football coaching position in January 1975. Though Sloan originally declined,<ref>{{cite news| title=Texas Tech may name Sloan as new coach| url=http://newspapers.umsystem.edu/default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?BaseHRef=CMN/1975/01/01&EntityId=Ar00706&Skin=Google&ViewMode=GIF| publisher=''[[Columbia Missourian]]''| date=1975-01-01}}</ref><ref name="Sloan-eyes-TTU">{{cite news| title=Sloan eyes Texas Tech offer| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BtkNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=f3kDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3327,223338| publisher=''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''| date=1975-01-01 |pages=C2}}</ref> he took the job on January 2, 1975.<ref>{{cite news| title=Sloan changes mind, accepts coaching job at Texas Tech| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=B9kNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=f3kDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6858,962389| publisher=''St. Petersburg Times''| date=1976-01-02 |pages=C2}}</ref> Texas Tech was believed to have offered him a [[United States dollar|$]]30,000 per year contract, as well as $11,000 from television show income.<ref name="Sloan-eyes-TTU" /> He took five of his assistant coaches with him to the Red Raiders program, including [[defensive coordinator]] [[Bill Parcells]].<ref>{{cite news| title=Football coaches on the move| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8uMNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gnkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4023,4665081| publisher=''St. Petersburg Times''| date=1975-01-14| pages=C2}}</ref> In his three seasons with Texas Tech, Sloan compiled a 23<U+2013>12 record.

In late 1977, Sloan took his third head coaching job with the [[Ole Miss Rebels football]] program.<ref>{{cite news| title=Sloan leaves Texas Tech for Ole Miss| publisher=''The Washington Post''| date=1977-12-02}}</ref> Sloan was head coach for five seasons at Ole Miss, winning 20 games, losing 34, and tying one. His best season came in 1978 when the Rebels finished at 5<U+2013>6.

In December 1982, Sloan decided to leave Ole Miss to become the head football coach for the [[Duke Blue Devils football]] program.<ref>{{cite news| title=Bear retires from Alabama sidelines| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FOYOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aYMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6517,224786| publisher=''[[Deseret News]]''| date=1982-12-16| pages=2D| quote=... who just left the University of Mississippi for the head coaching job at Duke.}}</ref> In his first season at Duke, Sloan led the Blue Devils to a 3<U+2013>8 record, despite beginning the season 0<U+2013>7.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_game_by_game.php?coachid=2165&year=1983| title=Coaching Records Game by Game: 1983| publisher=College Football DataWarehouse| accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref> In his remaining three seasons, he compiled a 10<U+2013>23 record before resigning.
