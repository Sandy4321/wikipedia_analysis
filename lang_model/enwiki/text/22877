'''Hayd<U+00E9>e Mercedes Sosa''', known as '''La Negra''', (9 July 1935<ref name="birth">[http://www.brainyhistory.com/events/1935/july_9_1935_93941.html Mercedes Sosa] at BrainyHistory.com</ref> &ndash; 4 October 2009) was an [[Music of Argentina|Argentine singer]] who was popular throughout [[South America]] and some countries outside the continent. With her roots in Argentine [[folk music]], Sosa became one of the preeminent exponents of [[nueva canci<U+00F3>n]]. She gave voice to songs written by both Brazilians and Cubans. She was best known as the "voice of the voiceless ones".<ref name="tmc">[http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2007/12/08/3150199.htm Singer Mercedes Sosa: The voice of the 'voiceless ones' outlasts South American dictatorships]</ref>

Sosa performed in venues such as the [[Lincoln Center]] in [[New York City]], the [[Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre Mogador]] in [[Paris]] and the [[Sistine Chapel]] in [[Vatican City]], as well as sell-out shows in New York's [[Carnegie Hall]] and the [[Rome|Roman]] [[Coliseum]] during her final decade of life. Her career spanned four decades and she has been the recipient of several Grammy awards and nominations, including three nominations which will be decided posthumously. She served as an ambassador for [[UNICEF]].

==Life==
Sosa was born on 9 July 1935, in [[San Miguel de Tucum<U+00E1>n]], in the northwestern Argentine province of [[Tucum<U+00E1>n Province|Tucum<U+00E1>n]], of [[mestizo]], [[French people|French]], and [[Quechua people|Quechua]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] ancestry.<ref name="Legendary folk singer Mercedes Sosa dies at 74"/> In 1950, at age fifteen, she won a singing competition organized by a local radio station and was given a contract to perform for two months.<ref name="Mercedes Sosa: Obituary"/> She recorded her first album, ''La Voz de la Zafra'', in 1959.<ref name="Mercedes Sosa: Obituary"/> A performance at the 1965 [[Cosqu<U+00ED>n Festival|Cosqu<U+00ED>n National Folklore Festival]] -where she was introduced and brought to the scene while seating among the public by fellow folk singer [[Jorge Cafrune]]-,<ref name="test">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzwL8C2hE6c], The presentation by Jorge Cafrune and the song Mercedes Sosa sang are available here. Retrieved 3.03.2010.</ref> brought her to the attention of her native countrypeople.<ref name="Mercedes Sosa: Obituary"/>

Sosa and her first husband, Manuel <U+00D3>scar Matus, with whom she had one son, were key players in the mid-60s [[nueva canci<U+00F3>n]] movement (which was called ''nuevo cancionero'' in Argentina).<ref name="Latin artist Mercedes Sosa dies"/> Her second record was ''Canciones con Fundamento'', a collection of Argentine folk songs.

In 1967, Sosa toured the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] with great success. In later years, she performed and recorded extensively, broadening her repertoire to include material from throughout Latin America.

In the early 1970s, Sosa released two concept albums in collaboration with composer [[Ariel Ram<U+00ED>rez]] and lyricist [[F<U+00E9>lix Luna]]: ''Cantata Sudamericana'' and ''Mujeres Argentinas'' (Argentine Women). She also recorded a tribute to [[Chile]]an poet [[Violeta Parra]] in 1971, including what was to become one of Sosa's signature songs, ''[[Gracias a la Vida]]''.<ref name="Legendary folk singer Mercedes Sosa dies at 74"/><ref name=ap/> She also improved the popularity of songs written by [[Milton Nascimento]] of [[Brazil]] and [[Pablo Milan<U+00E9>s]] and [[Silvio Rodr<U+00ED>guez]] both from [[Cuba]].<ref name="Legendary folk singer Mercedes Sosa dies at 74"/>

After the [[National Reorganization Process|military junta]] of [[Jorge Videla]] came to power in 1976, the atmosphere in Argentina grew increasingly oppressive. At a concert in [[La Plata]] in 1979, Sosa was searched and arrested on stage, along with the attending crowd.<ref name="Latin artist Mercedes Sosa dies"/> Their release came about through international intervention.<ref name="Mercedes Sosa: Obituary"/> Banned in her own country, she moved to [[Paris]] and then to [[Madrid]].<ref name="Mercedes Sosa: Obituary"/><ref name="Latin artist Mercedes Sosa dies"/> Her second husband died in 1978.

Sosa returned to Argentina in 1982,<ref name="Latin artist Mercedes Sosa dies"/> several months before the military regime collapsed as a result of the [[Malvinas War]], and gave a series of concerts at the Opera [[Teatro Col<U+00F3>n]] in [[Buenos Aires]], where she invited many of her younger colleagues to share the stage. A double album of recordings from these performances became an instant best seller. In subsequent years, Sosa continued to tour both in Argentina and abroad, performing in such venues as the [[Lincoln Center]] in [[New York]] and the [[Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre Mogador]] in Paris. In a poor condition of health for much of the 1990s, she performed a comeback show in Argentina in 1998.<ref name="Mercedes Sosa: Obituary"/> In 1994, she played the [[Sistine Chapel]] in [[Vatican City]].<ref name="Legendary folk singer Mercedes Sosa dies at 74">{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20091004-legendary-folk-singer-mercedes-sosa-dies-74-argentina-entertainment-music|title=Legendary folk singer Mercedes Sosa dies at 74|date=2009-10-04|accessdate=2009-10-05|publisher=[[France 24]]}}</ref> In 2002, she sold out both [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York and the [[Coliseum]] in [[Rome]] in the same year.<ref name="Legendary folk singer Mercedes Sosa dies at 74"/>
