The '''William M. Jennings Trophy''' is an annual award given to "to the goalkeeper(s) having played a minimum of 25 games for the team with the fewest goals scored against it. Winners are selected based on regular-season play."<ref name="Jennings history"/> Up until 1981, the [[Vezina Trophy]] had been awarded under that definition, but it was later changed and replaced by the Jennings Trophy. Since it's beginnings in 1982, it has been awarded at the end of 25 seasons to 27 different players. The most recent winners are [[Niklas B<U+00E4>ckstr<U+00F6>m|Niklas Backstrom]] and [[Emmanuel Fernandez|Manny Fernandez]] of the [[Minnesota Wild]], who combined for a league low 191 team goals against.

==History==
Until the [[1980-81 NHL season|1980-81 season]], the [[Vezina Trophy]] was awarded to the goaltender(s) of the team allowing the fewest number of goals during the [[regular season]].<ref name="Vezina history">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/trophies/vezina.html|title=Vezina Trophy history|accessdate=2007-09-17|publisher=NHL.com}}</ref> However, it was recognized that this system often meant the trophy went to the goaltender of the better team rather than the individual and hence the change was made to offer the Vezina to the most outstanding goaltender, as voted by the NHL General Managers. The William M. Jennings Trophy was created as a replacement and is awarded to the goaltender(s) playing for the team with the fewest goals against.<ref name="Vezina history3">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/silver_splashvezina.htm|title=Vezina Trophy history|accessdate=2007-09-17|publisher=LegendsofHockey.net}}</ref> 

The Jennings Trophy was donated by the NHL's board of governors and first presented at the conclusion of the [[1981-82 NHL season|1981-92 season]]. It is named in honor of the late [[William M. Jennings]], who was a longtime governor and president of the [[New York Rangers]] and a builder of [[ice hockey]] in the United States.<ref name="Jennings history">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/trophies/vezina.html|title=William M. Jennings Trophy history|accessdate=2007-09-17|publisher=NHL.com}}</ref> Normally the minimum number of games a goaltender must play to be eligible for the trophy is 25, but for the lockout shortened [[1994-95 NHL season|1994-95 season]], the required minimum was fourteen games.<ref name="espn">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/history/news/story?page=nhljennings|title=William H. Jennings Trophy winners|accessdate=2007-09-17|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}</ref> 

Five players have managed to win both the Jennings and Vezina Trophy for the same season: [[Patrick Roy]] ([[1988-89 NHL season|1988-89]] and [[1991-92 NHL season|1991-92]]), [[Ed Belfour]] ([[1990-91 NHL season|1990-91]] and [[1992-93 NHL season|1992-93]]), [[Dominik Hasek]] ([[1993-94 NHL season|1993-94]] and [[2000-01 NHL season|2000-01]]), [[Martin Brodeur]] ([[2002-03 NHL season|2002-03]] and [[2003-04 NHL season|2003-04]]) and [[Miikka Kiprusoff]] ([[2005-06 NHL season|2005-06]]).<ref name="Vezina history"/> Roy has won the trophy five times, the most of any goaltender. Brodeur is second, having won the trophy four times. It has been won most often by the [[Montreal Canadiens]], on 5 occasions. The [[New Jersey Devils]] have won four times, and [[Buffalo Sabres]] and [[Chicago Blackhawks]] have three wins each.
