[[Armenia]] has [[Armenia in the Eurovision Song Contest|participated]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]], while [[Azerbaijan]] has [[Azerbaijan in the Eurovision Song Contest|participated]] since 2008. [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Continuing conflicts]] between the two countries over the region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], which has been under control of the ''de facto'' [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]] since 1993<U+2014>but is considered to be a ''[[de jure]]'' part of Azerbaijan, have afflicted the Eurovision Song Contest on several occasions.

Conflicts between Armenia and Azerbaijan first appeared in 2006, when Azeri media criticized the event's website for listing Nagorno-Karabakh as the birthplace of Armenia's first representative, as it was part of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] at the time. Conflicts notably escalated throughout the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009 contest]]: during the semi-finals, Azeri officials objected to the depiction of the Nagorno-Karabakh monument ''[[We Are Our Mountains]]'' during an introductory video for the [[Jan Jan|Armenian entry]]. Armenia retaliated during the finals by displaying multiple images of the monument whilst presenting its voting results. Following the contest, it was alleged that Azerbaijan's state broadcaster had attempted to censor the [[televote|televoting]] number for Armenia, and that the Azeri government had gathered information on the citizens who voted for Armenia so they could interrogate them as "potential security threats". Following an inquiry, Azerbaijan was fined by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) for breaching the privacy of voters.

Following the [[2010 Junior Eurovision Song Contest]], Armenian media reported that Azerbaijan's broadcaster had cut off the broadcast when it became apparent that Armenia had won; however, it was disputed whether the contest was even broadcast in Azerbaijan. Accordingly, as Azerbaijan prepared to host the [[2012 Eurovision Song Contest]] following its [[Running Scared (Eldar & Nigar song)|victory]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]], the contest became the subject of a boycott by a group of Armenian musicians. Armenia would officially pull out of the event in March 2012, a move which would be criticized by Azeri critics who felt that their participation could have been a symbol of peace between the two nations, and that the decision would further damage the country's reputation.

==Initial appearances==
In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]], the official Eurovision website listed the birthplace of [[Andr<U+00E9> (singer)|Andr<U+00E9>]]<U+2014>[[Armenia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Armenia]]'s first ever representative at the contest, as being in the "Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh". Media outlets in Azerbaijan criticized the contest's organizers for recognizing the republic, especially given that the region was an [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast|autonomus oblast]] within the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] when Andr<U+00E9> was born in 1979. The birthplace listing on Andr<U+00E9>'s profile was later removed entirely.<ref name=telegraph-needfriends>{{cite web|title=You need friends to win in Eurovision|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3625080/You-need-friends-to-win-in-Eurovision.html|website=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref><ref name=dayaz-error>{{cite web|title=<U+0410><U+0431><U+0443><U+043B><U+044C><U+0444><U+0430><U+0437> <U+0413><U+0430><U+0440><U+0430><U+0435><U+0432>: "<U+0420><U+0443><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+043E><U+0434><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+043E> <U+0415><U+0432><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0434><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+044F> <U+0443><U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+043B><U+043E> <U+043E><U+0448><U+0438><U+0431><U+043A><U+0443> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+0441><U+0432><U+043E><U+0435><U+043C> <U+0441><U+0430><U+0439><U+0442><U+0435>" |url=http://www.day.az/news/showbiz/43927.html|website=Day.az|accessdate=4 June 2014|language=Belarusian}}</ref>

Azerbaijan itself did not participate in that year's contest; the [[Azerbaijan in the Eurovision Song Contest|country]] would make its official Eurovision debut in [[2008 Eurovision Song Contest|2008]]. That year, the Armenian [[Q<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>, Q<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>|entry]] would achieve a 4th place finish, while Azerbaijan's [[Day After Day (Elnur H<U+00FC>seynov and Samir Javadzadeh song)|inaugural entry]] would finish in 8th.<ref name=esc-azerbaijan>{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan: Major success since 2008 debut|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=64233|website=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=2 December 2014}}</ref><ref name=taw-4thplace>{{cite web|title=Disappointing Performance Leaves Armenia Behind at Eurovision|url=http://armenianweekly.com/2011/05/11/disappointing-performance-leaves-armenia-behind-at-eurovision/|website=The Armenian Weekly|accessdate=2 December 2014}}</ref>

==2009 contest==

===Postcard controversy and aftermath===
[[File:Eurovision 2009 Armenia voting.png|thumb|In protest of complaints by Azerbaijan, Armenia displayed multiple images of the Nagorno-Karabak monument ''We Are Our Mountains'' while presenting its votes.]]
During the first semi-final of the 2009 contest, the "postcard" video introducing a performance of the Armenian entry "[[Jan Jan]]" depicted, amongst other monuments, ''[[We Are Our Mountains]]'', an art piece located in Nagorno-Karabakh's capital city of [[Stepanakert]]. Azerbaijani officials complained about the incorporation of the monument in the postcard, as it considers the republic to be part of Azerbaijan. For the finals of the contest, the offending statue was edited out of the Armenian postcard.<ref name="frontline">{{cite web |url=http://www.frontlineclub.com/festering_wounds_overshadow_eurovision_in_the_south_caucasus/ |title=Ethnic rivalry wins over kitsch in the Caucasus |last=Krikorian |first=Onnik |date=2009-05-16 |publisher=''[[Frontline Club]]'' |accessdate=2008-09-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Eurovision_A_MeltingPot_Contest_Where_Native_Doesnt_Always_Mean_Best/1732594.html|title=Eurovision: A Melting-Pot Contest, Where Native Doesn't Always Mean Best|last=Deasy|first=Kristin|date=2009-05-15|publisher=''[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]''|accessdate=2009-05-17| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090517043108/http://www.rferl.org/content/Eurovision_A_MeltingPot_Contest_Where_Native_Doesnt_Always_Mean_Best/1732594.html| archivedate= 17 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In protest of the decision, multiple photographs of ''We Are Our Mountains'' were displayed during the presentation of voting results from Armenia; one was displayed on a video screen at [[Yerevan]]'s main square in the background, and another was displayed on the back of the [[clipboard]] being used by presenter [[Sirusho]].<ref name="frontline" /><ref name=time-wagewar/> Despite the controversy, 1,065 Armenians voted for the Azerbaijani entry, enough to give the country a single point. A total of 43 Azerbaijanis voted for the Armenian entry.<ref name="rfl-amends"/>

===Censorship, interrogation of voters===
Following the contest, reports surfaced that the local Azeri broadcaster, [[<U+0130>ctimai Television]], had attempted to censor the Armenian performance from its broadcast of the final, and had obscured the voting number for the entry in an effort to discourage voting for it. <U+0130>TV denied these claims, and provided footage showing that its broadcast was untampered.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.1news.az/bomond/20090526113051515.html |title=<U+0413><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0441><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+0435> <U+0437><U+0430> <U+0418><U+043D><U+0433><U+0443> <U+0438> <U+0410><U+043D><U+0443><U+0448> <U+0432> <U+0410><U+0437><U+0435><U+0440><U+0431><U+0430><U+0439><U+0434><U+0436><U+0430><U+043D><U+0435> /<U+0412><U+0418><U+0414><U+0415><U+041E>/ |publisher=1news.az |date=2009-05-26 |accessdate=2011-07-05}}</ref><ref name=ararat-diplomacy>{{cite web|title=Can Eurovision Succeed Where Diplomacy Has Failed?|url=http://araratmagazine.org/2011/05/can-eurovision-succeed-where-diplomacy-has-failed/|website=Ararat|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref> In August 2009, a number of Azerbaijanis who had voted for Armenia's entry during the contest were summoned for questioning at the Ministry of National Security in [[Baku]], during which they were accused of being "unpatriotic" and "a potential security threat".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8205907.stm|title=Azerbaijanis in Eurovision probe|date=17 August 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-08-17}}</ref><ref name=rfl-az01>{{cite web|title=Azerbaijani Authorities Interrogate Music Fan Over Eurovision Vote For Armenia|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/feature/1800013.html|website=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref> One of those summoned, Rovshan Nasirli (who had voted for "Jan Jan" because he felt it was a better reflection of Azeri music than "[[Always (Aysel and Arash song)|Always]]", the country's actual entry) said that he was told by his interrogators that they had the names and addresses of all 43 Azerbaijanis who had voted for Armenia.<ref name=rfl-az02>{{cite web|title=Azeris Questioned Over Eurovision Vote For Armenia|url=http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/1800027.html|website=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref>

Following these reports, [[Svante Stockselius]], executive supervisor of the Eurovision Song Contest, announced the launch of an enquiry into the incidents.<ref name=rfl-az03>{{cite web|title=Eurovision Organizer Probes Azeri Crackdown|url=http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/1803351.html|website=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref> In their response, <U+0130>ctimai TV stated that while two individuals had been invited to the Ministry of National Security, the Ministry of National Security had given assurances that nobody had been questioned, either officially or unofficially, on voting in the competition itself. EBU Director General, Jean R<U+00E9>veillon, responded to this by saying that freedom to vote is one of the cornerstones of the contest and "Any breach of privacy regarding voting, or interrogation of individuals, is totally unacceptable".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=3863 |title=EBU receives responses from Azerbaijan |work=Eurovision.tv |date=2009-09-11 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref> Azerbaijani Minister of Youth and Sport, [[Azad Rahimov]], denied that anyone had been summoned to the Ministry of National Security about voting for the Armenian entry, and accused [[RFE/RL]] and other news outlets of reporting the allegations to create a scandal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Azerbaijani_Minister_Criticizes_RFERL_Over_Eurovision_Interrogation_Story/1815075.html |title=Azerbaijani Minister Criticizes RFE/RL Over Eurovision Interrogation Story |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=2009-09-04 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref>

The Reference Group of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU), which organizes Eurovision, examined the matter at a meeting in [[Oslo]] on 11 September 2009. In a statement issued on 17 September, the EBU acknowledged the allegations that Azeri officials were interrogating voters and breaching their privacy. While the EBU would not impose sanctions on or ban Azerbaijan from future editions of the contest (the country could have been banned from the contest for three years), it did change its rules to make participating broadcasters liable for the "disclosure of information which could be used to identify voters" during future editions of the contest. Previously, telecommunications providers were liable, but the EBU could not impose sanctions on them. Azerbaijan was also fined <U+20AC>2,700 by the EBU.<ref name="rfl-amends">{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Eurovision_Changes_Rules_But_Does_Not_Sanction_Azerbaijan/1825025.html |title=Eurovision Amends Rules, Does Not Sanction Azerbaijan |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref><ref name=ararat-diplomacy/>

==2012 contest==
[[File:Baku Crystal Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Armenia dropped out of the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest ''([[Baku Crystal Hall|venue]] pictured)'' following a formal boycott by a group of local musicians.]]
The [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012 Eurovision Song Contest]] was hosted by [[Baku]], Azerbaijan after their win in [[2011 Eurovision Song Contest|2011]]. Although the country did temporarily amend its [[Visa policy of Azerbaijan|visa policy]] to allow Armenians to enter the country so they could attend the event (they are normally barred from entry), a boycott effort emerged in February 2012 following an incident where a 20-year-old Armenian soldier was shot dead on the border between the two countries. Armenian officials initially blamed the soldier's death on an Azerbaijani sniper; however, conflicting reports indicated that the death was the result of [[friendly fire]].<ref name=nyt-shunning/> Also in February, Azeri president [[Ilham Aliyev]] made a statement re-affirming the country's stance against Armenians, arguing that they control "hypocritical and corrupt politicians."<ref name=time-wagewar/> 22 Armenian musicians, including previous Armenian Eurovision representatives [[Emmy (Armenian singer)|Emmy]] and [[Eva Rivas]], signed an open letter supporting a boycott, stating that they would "refuse to appear in a country that is well-known for the mass killings and massacres of Armenians, in a country where anti-Armenian sentiments have been elevated to the level of state policy."<ref name=time-wagewar>{{cite web|title=How Armenia and Azerbaijan Wage War Through Eurovision|url=http://world.time.com/2012/03/11/how-armenia-and-azerbaijan-wage-war-through-eurovision/|website=Time|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref><ref name=nyt-shunning>{{cite web|title=Armenians Are Shunning Song Contest in Azerbaijan|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/world/asia/armenia-shuns-eurovision-hosted-by-azerbaijan-a-rival.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref>

On 7 March 2012, Armenian officials announced that the country would withdraw from the 2012 contest. The EBU stated that it was "truly disappointed" with Armenia's withdrawal, and that "despite the efforts of the EBU and the Host Broadcaster to ensure a smooth participation for the Armenian delegation in this year's Contest, circumstances beyond our control lead to this unfortunate decision."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=48413&_t=armenia_withdraws_from_eurovision_2012 |title= Armenia withdraws from Eurovision 2012 |publisher=Eurovision.tv |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/world/20120307/171835386.html |title=Armenia Officially Rejects Eurovision Song Contest |publisher=RIA Novosti |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref>  <U+0130>TV General Director Ismayil Omarov expressed his regret about Armenia's withdrawal, believing that the country's presence could have been a "joint peace message to the world."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.apa.az/news/167456 |title=Ismayil Omarov: "The performance of Armenia<U+2019>s representative on Baku stage could be a joint peace message to the world" |publisher=APA |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref> Local politician Ali Ahmadov also criticized the Armenian delegation for its decision, stating that "[its] refusal to take part in such a respected contest will cause even further damage to the already damaged image of Armenia."<ref name=time-wagewar/>

==2010 Junior Eurovision Song Contest==
[[Vladimir Arzumanyan]], a singer from Nagorno-Karabakh representing Armenia, won the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010 Junior Eurovision Song Contest]]. It was alleged by Armenian media outlets that the broadcast of the contest in Azerbaijan was interrupted when it became apparent that Armenia had won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.am/eng/news/38887.html |title=Azerbaijan interrupted Eurovision-2010 broadcast after the victory of the Armenian performer from Karabakh |publisher=NEWS.am |date=2009-06-13 |accessdate=2012-08-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/culture/news/57089/Azerbaijan_does_not_endure_victory_of_Vladimir_Arzumanyan_at_2010_Junior_Eurovision |title=Azerbaijan does not "endure" victory of Vladimir Arzumanyan at 2010 Junior Eurovision |publisher=PanArmenian |date=2010-11-21 |accessdate=2012-08-08}}</ref>

These claims were disputed by [[Armenia 1]] director and Eurovision delegation leader Diana Mnatsakanyan, who also denied reports that the country was preparing to file a complaint with the EBU over the matter. She noted that the broadcaster did not know whether Azerbaijan even aired the contest at all, given that the country had "no interest" in the event at the time, and that reports about the alleged incident were limited to posts on Azerbaijani [[Internet forum|forums]].<ref name=panarmenian-notcutoff>{{cite web|title=Public Television of Armenia denies the country<U+2019>s intention to file complaint against Azerbaijan to European Broadcasting Union|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/57152/|website=PanArmenian.net|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref> Azerbaijan would ultimately make its official debut at the Junior Eurovision [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2012|two years later]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=junior_2012_12_countries_to_take_part|title=Junior 2012: 12 countries to take part|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|date=1 September 2012|accessdate=3 September 2012}}</ref>
