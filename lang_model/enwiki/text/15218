'''New York State Route 73''' is a state highway entirely in [[Essex County, New York]]. The highway begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 86]] in downtown [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]]. It heads through some of the mountains in the [[Adirondacks|Adirondack Region]], crossing along bases of some of the highest mountains in the state, including Porter and Lower Wolfjaw Mountains. The highway has a short concurrency with [[New York State Route 9N]] in the area of [[Keene, New York|Keene]]. Later it merges with [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. Route 9]] one mile north of Underwood. 

The original highways in the area were of no condition to help transportation in the area, which eventually became Keene, New York. The highways were mainly unbalanced and very close to impassible. Eventually, people settled in the area, helping the area grow into Keene. Keene eventually opened a privately-maintained road to AuSable Lake, helping generate funds for the ever growing area in the [[Adirondack Park]]. The area continued to prosper over time, until the state-wide takeover of roads in 1909.  

Route 73 was assigned in 1930 from [[NY 28N]] in Tawahus to [[NY 22]] in [[Ticonderoga, New York|Ticonderoga]]. The route north of that was known as '''New York State Route 86A'''. The rest was known as '''New York State Route 427'''. In the 1950s, Route 73 was extended over 86A, and soon afterwards, over Route 9 to what is now [[New York State Route 74]]. When Route 74 was decommissioned in the western Chautauqua County, it was recommissioned over the US&nbsp;9&ndash;Vermont segment, and Route 73 was truncated back to US 9.

==Route description==
Route 73 begins near the eastern end of the village of [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], at a traffic light with NY 86. The highway goes to the southwest, passing local homes as Sentinel Road. At the intersection with Mill Pond Road, Route 73 passes a small pond, crossing over the creek it becomes. For that short time, the highway is heading southward. The route quickly turns to the southeast, passing more homes in Lake Placid. The surroundings of the highway remain the same as they leave Lake Placid via Cascade Road.<ref name="google">{{cite map|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1T4ADBF_enUS232US232&q=from%3A%20RT-73%20N%20%4044.101462%2C%20-73.686413%20to%3A%20Cascade%20Rd%2FRT-73%20%4044.241940%2C%20-73.942651%20to%3ART-73%2FSentinel%20Rd%20%4044.279538%2C%20-73.980252&um=1&sa=N&tab=wl|title=Overview map of NY 73|publisher=Google Maps|cartography=NAVTEQ|accessdate=2008-06-23}}</ref>

Route 73 heads into North Elba, where it passes [[Lake Placid Airport]]. There, [[County Route 35 (Essex County, New York)|Essex County Route 35]] merges in from the northwest. Just south of North Elba, Route 73 passes the [[Olympic Jumping Complex]]. However, this is not accessible via NY 73 except from the intersection with CR 35. The highway crosses the West Branch of the [[Ausable River (New York)|Ausable River]], intersecting with County Route 21 on an elevation of {{convert|1800|ft|m}}.<ref name="google"/>

Cascade Road makes several different turns in direction, running to the south of the Craig Wood Golf Course. Just after the golf course, Route 73 climbs in elevation again, this time up to {{convert|2000|ft|m}}. The highway turns from the southeast to the east, and to the southeast once more as it rounds Round Lake. The road passes Mud Pond, where it turns to the northeast along the side of a high ridge. Pitchoff Mountain is directly to the northwest as Route 73 passes Upper Cascade and Lower Cascade Lakes.<ref name="google"/> 
[[Image:NY 73 from Rooster Comb.jpg|thumb|left|New York State Route 73, Keene Valley, from Rooster Comb Mountain]] 
Route 73 begins to fall in elevation as it progresses farther, with County Route 51 splitting off and merging in as the route heads into [[Keene, New York|Keene]]. After crossing the East Branch of the Ausable River, Route 73 merges in with [[New York State Route 9N]]. The two roads continue to drop in elevation, passing and circling around mountains as they head along. Just after Norton Cemetery, Route 9N splits off to the east and Route 73 continues southward. Route 73 now longs along the East Branch, intersecting with county and local roads as its heads southward.<ref name="google"/> 

The highway heads along the base of Porter Mountain and into Keene Valley. There, it crosses Johns Brook and heads through downtown. Lower Wolfjaw Mountain, which averages the same height as Porter, is passed to the east by Route 73 and the Ausable River branch. There are a few more ponds and mountains before NY 73 merges into [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. Route 9]].<ref name="google"/>

==History==
=== Keene's highways and their effects on Essex County ===
The town of Keene was created from annexing parts of [[Jay, New York|Jay]] and [[Elizabethtown, New York|Elizabethtown]] on March 19, 1808. This originally included current [[North Elba, New York|North Elba]], but that was split in 1848 from the original Keene. The area had been made up of a mountainous and rocky surface, with a low population due to the unbalanced soil in the area. A nearby highway was extended to Keene Center via Lewis and Jay, but the highway was hardly passable due to the structure of the highway.<ref name="book">{{cite book|title=The History of Essex County|author=H.P. Smith|publisher=D. Mason and Company|year=1885}}</ref>

The area had been big with the lumber and iron industries. However, exporting the stuff made by these industries were hard as there was a lack of transportation in the area. Business began to boom when around 1820, the town had sawmills, forges and gristmills popping up all over the area. With the riverbed region of Keene hosting the first community, the town began to grow, with Keene Flats being a full-fledged community by 1840. The area continued to grow, and in 1882, when the [[Adirondack Park]] was created as a protected area in the state, a road to lower AuSable Lake was constructed. This road was tolled and maintained privately. The new road helped the economy of what became known as Keene Valley.<ref name="keenehistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.adkhistorycenter.org/esco/tow/keene.html|title=Keene, NY|publisher=Essex County Historical Society|date=2008|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref>

=== Designation ===
NY 73 was assigned as part of the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]] to a previously unnumbered roadway between [[New York State Route 28N|NY 28N]] in [[Tahawus, New York|Tahawus]] and [[New York State Route 22|NY 22]] in [[Ticonderoga (hamlet), New York|Ticonderoga]] via the hamlets of North Hudson and Severance.<ref name=renum>{{cite news|author=Leon A.

In the 1950s, NY 73 was extended northward to Lake Placid by way of Underwood and Keene, supplanting all of NY 86A and [[overlap (road)|overlap]]ping US 9 from Severance to Underwood.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Sunoco]] |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1952}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York and New Jersey Tourgide<!--sic--> Map |publisher=[[Gulf Oil|Gulf]] |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1960}}</ref> By 1961, NY 73 was also extended eastward through Ticonderoga to the ferry dock on [[Lake Champlain]], connecting to [[Vermont Route 74]] (via the Fort Ticonderoga-Larrabees Point Ferry) and replacing [[New York State Route 347 (1930s)|NY 347]].<ref>{{cite map |title=New York and Metropolitan New York |publisher=[[Sunoco]] |cartography=[[H.M.
