'''Wright Peak''' is the 16th highest peak in the [[High Peaks]] of the [[Adirondack Park]], and is located in the MacIntyre Range in the town of [[North Hudson, New York|North Hudson]], in [[Essex County, New York|Essex County]], [[New York]].  Wright is the northern most peak in the MacIntyre Range, and is know to have one of the windiest peaks in the park. There are also long slides from the summit that lead to [[Marcy Dam]] which are often skiied in the wintertime.

The usual approach to Wright peak is from the [[Adirondack Loj]] heading 1.3 miles up the Van Hovenberg trail, then ascending the steep MacIntyre Range Trail to the junction for [[Algonquin Peak]].  Take a left and head up the last few hundred feet of elevation through the alpine zone.  Wright is often hiked in conjunction with Algonquin and even [[Iroquois Peak]]

===B-47 Crash Site===
In January, 1962, a [[B-47|B-47 bomber]] on a training mission crashed into Wright Peak, killing all four crewmen. Pieces of the wreckage can still be found on the summit, along with a plaque near the impact site. Some of the crash debris is quite large, and hikers making the trip to the summit have been known to take small pieces down with them as souvenirs.
