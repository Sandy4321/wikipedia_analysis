'''Bob Grant''' (born March 14, 1929), is an [[United States|American]] radio host whose real name is  '''Robert Ciro Gigante'''.  A veteran of broadcasting in [[New York City]], Grant is considered a pioneer of the "conservative" and "confrontational" [[talk radio|talk radio format]].<ref>[http://www.talkers.com/greatest/16rGrant.htm Talkers Magazine Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.radiohof.org/2004_nominees.html National Radio Hall of Fame & Museum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2007/08/23/2007-08-23_wabc_welcomes_back_bob_grant_-2.html</ref>

==Career==
===Early work===
Bob Grant graduated from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] with a degree in [[journalism]]. He began working in radio in the 1940s at the news department at [[WBBM (AM)]] in [[Chicago]], as a radio personality and television talk show host at [[KNX (AM)]] in [[Los Angeles]], and as an actor. He later became sports director at [[KABC (AM)]] in Los Angeles, where after some substitute appearances he inherited the talk show of early controversialist [[Joe Pyne]] in 1964 and began to build a following.

Grant came to New York in 1970, where he hosted a talk show on [[WMCA]] as the "house [[conservative]]", distinctively out of fashion with both the times and with some [[counterculture|countercultural]] WMCA personalities, including [[Alex Bennett]].  His offbeat but combative style (along with [[Fairness Doctrine]] requirements of the era) won him seven years on WMCA, with a growing and loyal audience.

After leaving WMCA in 1977, Grant went up the dial to [[New York]]'s [[WOR (AM)]] for a time, after which he worked at [[WWDB]] in [[Philadelphia]].

===WABC (1984-1996)===
After returning to New York in 1984 to join [[WABC (AM)]], ''The Bob Grant Show'' consistently dominated the ratings in the highly competitive afternoon [[drive time]] slot in [[New York City]].  The gravel-voiced Grant reminded listeners during the daily introduction that the "program was unscripted and unrehearsed".

Grant's political philosophy generally followed [[American conservatism]], but with some lurches into [[populism]], [[libertarianism]], [[conspiracy theory]], and unorthodoxy (such as being [[pro-choice]] and anti-[[Flag Desecration Amendment]]).  As a resident of [[Manalapan, New Jersey]] in the mid-1990s, he considered running for statewide office, but eventually decided against it.

Grant's long stay at WABC ended when he was fired for a remark about the [[1996 Croatia USAF CT-43 crash|3 April 1996 airplane crash]] involving [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Commerce Secretary]] [[Ron Brown (U.S. politician)|Ron Brown]]. Grant remarked to caller Carl Limbacher, "My hunch is [Brown] is the one survivor. I just have that hunch. Maybe it's because at heart I'm a pessimist." When Brown was found dead, Grant's comments were widely criticized, and several weeks later, after a media campaign, his contract was terminated.<ref>''[[New York Times]]'', 18 April 1996, [http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/18/nyregion/bob-grant-is-off-air-following-remarks-on-brown-s-death.html Bob Grant Is Off Air Following Remarks On Brown's Death]</ref><ref>''[[AlterNet]]'', 24 August 2009, [http://www.alternet.org/media/142149/as_if_limbaugh_and_beck_weren't_bad_enough,_the_granddaddy_of_hate_radio_is_back_on_the_air/?page=2 As If Limbaugh and Beck Weren't Bad Enough, the Granddaddy of Hate Radio Is Back on the Air]</ref>

===Return to WOR (1996-2006)===
After being fired, Grant moved down the dial to [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] to host the same type of show in the same time slot, where he would occasionally criticize his WABC replacement [[Sean Hannity]]. After Grant joined WOR, [[Arthur Frommer]], the travel guide publisher, who had a weekly show on the same station, quit in protest, saying, "If the object of Bob Grant's vile filth had been [[Jew]]s, or [[Italian people|Italians]], or [[Irish-American]]s, it is inconceivable that WOR would have taken this step", and also comparing Grant to [[Joseph Goebbels]].<ref>[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1343 "Won't Share Air with Bigot",] ''[[Extra!]],'' June 1996</ref> In the late 1990s, his show went into national syndication, but few stations picked it up and it reverted to a local show.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Grant's WOR run ended on January 13, 2006. Grant's ratings were not to blame for his departure, according to the ''[[New York Post]]'', which mentioned that the decision was reached because the station's other shows had niche audiences to garner more advertising dollars.<ref>[http://www.nypost.com/entertainment/58722.htm] {{Dead link|date=August 2008}}</ref> Having left his options open for "an offer he cannot refuse," Bob Grant returned to WOR in February 2006 doing one minute "Straight Ahead" commentaries, airing twice daily after news broadcasts until September 2006. Grant then made various isolated radio appearances. He appeared as a guest host on WFNY (now [[WXRK]]) in December 2006. Grant appeared a couple of times on [[Sean Hannity]]'s show on WABC.<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/story/383571p-325604c.html Arts and Entertainment News and Reviews - NY Daily News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.nypost.com/entertainment/carry_grant_back_to_wabc_radio_entertainment_john_mainelli.htm] {{Dead link|date=August 2008}}</ref>

===Return to WABC===
His guest appearances became more frequent beginning in July 2007. On July 7, 2007, he guest hosted for [[John R. Gambling]], and appeared on [[Mark Levin]]'s show (which is networked from WABC) on July 10. Grant, guest hosted for Jerry Agar on July 9, 10, 11 and re-appeared as a fill-in host again for John Gambling on August 20 and 21. Then, on August 22, while appearing on Hannity's show, he announced that he was returning as a regular host to WABC, in the 8-10 PM slot that at the time was filled by Agar. It would later be revealed, on what was Agar's final show a few hours later, that he would be starting effective immediately, as Grant took over the final segments of the show. His first full show on ABC since 1996 was on August 23. The story of Grant's return, as reported by the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', had been discovered only a couple of hours before Grant's official announcement.

Grant's stint lasted less than a year and a half, until his regular nightly show was pulled by [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] in late November 2008 as part of a programming shuffle stemming from the debut of [[Curtis Sliwa]]'s national show, and later [[Mark Levin]]'s show expanding to three hours, leaving no room for Grant.<ref name="nydn112508">{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2008/11/25/2008-11-25_veteran_radio_host_bob_grant_booted_from.html | title=Veteran radio host Bob Grant booted from nightly show on WABC | author=David Hinckley | publisher=''[[New York Daily News]]'' | date=2008-11-25}}</ref>  Grant did his most recent AM radio work as guest host filling in for Michael Savage on January 21, 2009, Mark Levin on March 23, 2009, and Sean Hannity on July 31, 2009.<ref name="nydn112508"/>

Bob Grant was scheduled to be the keynote speaker at the Morristown, New Jersey Tea Party on September 7, 2009,<ref>http://www.bobgrantonline.com/archive/post_Corzine.cfm</ref> but Grant did not appear.<ref>http://www.examiner.com/x-18410-Newark-Young-Conservative-Examiner~y2009m9d7-Morristown-Tea-Party-draws-thousands-against-Nobama</ref> No reason has been given for his absence.<ref>http://blogs.dailyrecord.com/morrispolitics/2009/09/08/where-was-bob-grant/</ref>

According to [http://www.bobgrantonline.com Bob Grant's Web Page] , he is once again returning to WABC on Sundays from noon to 2pm beginning September 13 "by popular demand".

===Internet broadcasting===
During the week of July 6, 2009 Grant began hosting an [[Internet radio]] show titled ''Straight Ahead!'' which originally ran Monday through Friday from 8 to 9 a.m. [[Eastern time]] on [[UBATV.com]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ubatv.com | title=UBATV.com}}</ref> The show differs from Grant's radio shows, in that the viewer watches Grant as he does his broadcast. The first two months of ''Straight Ahead!'' were from inside Grant's home. New York radio personalities [[Richard Bey]] and [[Jay Diamond]], who have worked with Grant in the past, were also brought on board to broadcast their own one hour shows. Archived episodes of Grant's show on UBATV's website can be accessed by clicking on Grant's picture on the homepage or by clicking on the On-Demand button on the homepage screen. Grant has mentioned that he does not get paid to do the UBATV show, but believes that Internet broadcasting is the future.<ref>http://www.bobgrantonline.com/archive/post_internet.cfm</ref><ref>http://www.bobgrantonline.com/archive/post_exit.cfm</ref>

Beginning in September 2009, Grant reduced the number of days his UBATV show ''Straight Ahead!'' runs from five days a week to two days a week. ''Straight Ahead!" now runs Mondays and Wednesdays from 10 to 11 a.m [[Eastern time]].  Grant also moved the show from his home to a professional studio.  Due to a low number of callers to the show, Grant usually interviews only guests for the hour. On January 13, 2010, Grant did his last UBATV SHOW.

===Weekly Sunday broadcasts and BobGrantOnline.com===
As of September 13, 2009, Grant began working in a weekly Sunday talk show, again, entitled ''The Bob Grant Show'' on [[WABC (AM)]] from 12 to 2pm. This two-hour format has allowed him to continue interacting with his fan base by way of an [[800 number]], providing greater anonymity and less scrutiny than that of a caller calling a local or long-distance phone number as at UBATV. In addition, the afternoon block allows for greater listenership and participation in his show.  At the close of his first show, he expressly thanked the management of the station for "inviting him back" and said he looked forward to continuing this joint venture every week for the foreseeable future.

Grant also prepares and submits weekly columns on his website, BobGrantOnline.com. The site was originally sponsored by [[NewsMax]].

==Controversial statements about race==
Over the years, Grant has made a number of statements on his shows that critics have described as racist. For example, he was quoted in the ''[[Newsday]]'' of June 2, 1992, as saying "Minorities are the Big Apple's majority, you don't need the papers to tell you that, walk around and you know it. To me, that's a bad thing. I'm a white person." In his book, Grant defended this statement by writing that he did not intend to put down other races, but only intended to express that "no one likes to be in the minority," and that America can only survive by retaining its "humane, west European culture." Thus, he supports ending [[bilingualism]] and [[multiculturalism]], two policies of which he has been highly critical.

According to the website for the [[political left|left]]-leaning media watchdog organization [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR),{{Nonspecific|date=October 2009}} Grant has repeatedly advocated "[[eugenics]]" by promoting the "Bob Grant Mandatory Sterilization Program," which he describes as temporary sterilizations for women of childbearing age who wish to receive [[welfare]] payments. Grant's controversial statements about "welfare mothers" are often called racist. FAIR also quotes Grant as saying, on January 6, 1992, that the U.S. has "millions of sub-humanoids, savages, who really would feel more at home careening along the sands of the [[Kalahari]] or the dry deserts of eastern [[Kenya]] &mdash; people who, for whatever reason, have not become civilized."

Grant has professed admiration for several black Americans, however, including [[Thomas Sowell]], [[Colin Powell]], [[Juan Williams]], and [[Muhammad Ali]].

==Characteristics of Grant's radio shows==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Grant was known for using a number of [[catchphrase]]s on his show, such as "You're a fake, a phony, and a fraud!", "Straight ahead", "Get off my phone!", "Anything and everything is grist for our ever-grinding mill", and his closing line, "Your influence counts. Use it."  His opening line was used as the title of his 1996 book, ''Let's Be Heard'', a title representing an abbreviated version of his original opener, "And let's be heard! Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen, and welcome to another hour of the free and open exchange of ideas and opinions in the belief that as American citizens you have the right to hear, and to be heard." Before his daily monologue, Grant would ask the rhetorical question, "And what's on your mind today, hmmm?", and would sometimes call women "chickie-poos". During his WMCA years, Grant often ended his show with a blustery "Get [[Khaddafi]]."  On the WOR show, Grant often closed his show with the phrase, "Somebody's got to say these things, it ''has'' to be me!"

One of Grant's most memorable regular call-in guests was Ms. Trivia, who aired her "Beef of the Week", a series of seemingly trivial complaints, such as her objection to stale gum in baseball card packets, the exaltation of the lowly mouse in popular cartoon culture ([[Mickey Mouse]], [[Mighty Mouse]]) at the expense of portraying felines in a discriminatory manner ([[Felix the Cat|Felix, the trickster]], [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester, the loser cat with a lisp]], etc.) She later insisted that she be called "Mm. Trivia" in support of doing away with titles that differentiated men from women (such as Miss, Ms. or Mister). Grant referred to Mm. Trivia as the most popular personage on WMCA radio who wasn't even on the payroll. Ms. Trivia was Grant's guest at a Halloween Festival dinner held at Lauritano's Restaurant in the [[Bronx]], where a young Ms. Trivia, not long out of her teens, revealed herself for the first time to a startled radio audience, many who had expected and assumed, based upon her articulation and intonation, that she would be an elderly, prudish woman. Instead, a statuesque and fashionable Ms. Trivia, wearing an elaborate Victorian costume, was the surprise guest seated next to Grant at the dias table along with several political figures from New York. The following day the majority of calls to the show were for the purpose of obtaining information about the mysterious Mm. Trivia, with Grant in his typical manner finally in exasperation hanging up on the callers, shouting, "THIS IS NOT Mm. TRIVIA'S SHOW!"

Grant occasionally made on-air reference to an ethereal [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]]-like presence <U+00E0> la [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s [[The Divine Comedy#Paradiso|Paradiso]] section in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', "The Lady Josephine", to whom he constantly paid obeisance. His son, Jeff Grant, a traffic reporter with a different station, would call in occasionally. Grant made frequent references to the REO Diner in [[Woodbridge, New Jersey]], his regular haunt.

When once asked by the caller George the Atheist whether he believed in [[God]], Grant replied, "What if I tell you, George, that sometimes I do and sometimes I don't?" On his July 21, 2005 broadcast, Grant, a [[baptism|baptized]] and raised [[Roman Catholic]], unequivocally stated to the same caller his opinion on the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus]]: "He's not coming back. Look, I don't believe he's coming back.  I think that's a myth and I say it.  I don't trumpet it but if a person asks &mdash; and you know one thing for sure, I've been deadly honest, dead-on honest all the time I've been on the air talking to people and they ask me questions or they make a comment that elicits a response, they are going to get an honest response.  It may always not be 'correct' but it's honest."

On October 15, 2008, Grant said "Did you notice [[Barack Obama|Obama]] is not content with just having several American flags, plain old American flags with the 50 states represented by 50 stars? He has the 'O' flag. [...] He had the flag painted over, and the 'O' for Obama. Now,...these things are symptomatic of a person who would like to be a potentate &mdash; a dictator."  The "O" flag to which Grant referred was, in fact, the state flag of [[Ohio]].

==Influences and legacy==
Being largely the innovator of his own particular talk radio style, Grant previously worked with the likes of [[Barry Gray]] and [[Joe Pyne]]. Pyne would often end each broadcast with "Straight Ahead" which is something Grant picked up, leading many to believe that Grant was the first host to frequently use that line.

Over the years, national radio talk personality [[Howard Stern]] has made differing remarks on his admiration for Grant as an early influence. Upon Stern's arrival in New York, he cited Grant as an influence,<ref>http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/nanog/2005-12/msg00347.html</ref> but as Stern's stardom rose, Grant became the subject of ridicule on Stern's show. During Stern's prime, he denied being influenced by Grant or having respect for him.<ref name="koam.com">http://www.koam.com/haven/howard_interv.html</ref> Stern has also frequently criticized Grant for changing his act to appease management.<ref name="koam.com"/> Grant told Paul D. Colford, author of the 1996 Stern bio, ''[[Howard Stern: King of All Media]]'', about being approached at a public appearance by Ben Stern, Howard's father, with a teenage Howard in tow. Father introduced son to Grant and told him of Howard's desire to go into radio. "I looked at this big, gawky kid and I said to him, 'Just be yourself,'" Grant recalled. Stern has denied Grant's version of the story.<ref name="koam.com"/> Soon after Grant's firing from WABC, and before his first WOR show, Grant appeared as a call-in guest on Stern's radio show. In more recent years, Stern began to praise Grant's legacy, and called in on his last WOR show in 2006.<ref>http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1137387600</ref>

[[Glenn Beck]] now uses the catchphrase "Get off my phone!" as a spinoff of Grant's earlier call-in talk show style, as do [[Tom Scharpling]] and [[Mark Levin]]; similarly, [[Sean Hannity]] often uses Grant's phrase "Straight ahead."

In 2002, industry magazine ''[[Talkers magazine|Talkers]]'' ranked Grant as the 16th greatest radio talk show host of all time.<ref>[http://www.talkers.com/greatest/ Talkers Magazine Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On March 28, 2007 Bob Grant was nominated for induction into the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]].<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/rhofsection.php 2008 RHOF Inductees<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Radio & Records]] had planned to issue a Lifetime Achievement Award to Grant during its annual convention in March 2008; however, the award was revoked in January 2008 for "past comments by him that contradict our values and the respect we have for all members of our community."<ref>Rowland, Kara. [http://www.washingtontimes.com/article/20080117/BUSINESS/760146677/1006 Talk radio award revoked]. [[Washington Times]]. 17 January 2008.</ref> Several talk radio hosts have spoken out against the decision; [[Neal Boortz]] has stated:

{{cquote|I usually try not to miss the Radio & Records talk radio convention... Not this year. Maybe never again. R&R has succumbed to [[political correctness]]... I don't call for boycotts. But I do think it would be wonderful to see talk show hosts refuse to appear at this convention... What we have seen here in this revocation of the award to Bob Grant is simple pandering to [[political correctness]]. Nothing more, nothing less.<ref>Boortz, Neal. [http://boortz.com/nuze/200801/01172008.html Nealz Nuze]. 17 January 2008.</ref>}}

[[Sean Hannity]], [[Opie and Anthony]], Comedian [[Jim Norton]], [[Lars Larson]], [[Rush Limbaugh]], [[Mark Levin]], [[Lionel (radio)|Lionel]] and [[Howard Stern]] opposed the move as well, with Levin stating "I am disgusted with the mistreatment of Bob Grant. I am fed up with the censors, intimidators, and cowards in this business."{{Cite quote|date=October 2009}}  [[Don Imus]] deemed the award unimportant (confusing the award with one he earned from ''[[Talkers magazine]]''), offered to return awards he had received after treating them to his sledgehammer and block of wood, and called Grant's comments "stupid", although he also referred to Grant as a "legendary broadcaster."<ref>Imus, Don. [[Imus in the Morning]]. 19 January 2008. Partial reaction [http://www.musicradio77.com/wwwboard/messages/331978.html here].</ref>
