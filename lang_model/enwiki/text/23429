'''Jade Etherington''' (born 9 March 1991) is a British [[alpine skiing|alpine skier]] who, with her [[sighted guide]] [[Caroline Powell (skier)|Caroline Powell]],  won silver in the [[Alpine skiing at the 2014 Winter Paralympics&nbsp;<U+2013> Women's downhill|women's downhill skiing]], [[Alpine skiing at the 2014 Winter Paralympics&nbsp;<U+2013> Women's combined|combined]] and [[Alpine skiing at the 2014 Winter Paralympics&nbsp;<U+2013> Women's slalom|slalom]], and bronze medals in the [[Alpine skiing at the 2014 Winter Paralympics&nbsp;<U+2013> Women's Super-G|Super-G]] at the [[2014 Winter Paralympic Games]] in [[Sochi]]. Their three silvers and a bronze at the Winter Paralympics made them the most successful female British Winter Paralympians of all time, and the first Britons to win four medals at one Paralympics. Because of her success at the 2014 Paralympics, Etherington was the British flagbearer at the [[2014 Winter Paralympics closing ceremony]].

Etherington has only five percent vision in both eyes, thus competes in the [[visually impaired]] category, thus needs a [[sighted guide]], Caroline Powell. The pair have competed together since August 2013. After asking for a new guide through [[Facebook]] and after two other applicants pulled out, Etherington and Powell combined in April 2013.
