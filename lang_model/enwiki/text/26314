'''Stephen I''', also''' Saint Stephen''' ({{lang-hu|Szent Istv<U+00E1>n kir<U+00E1>ly}}; {{lang-la|Sanctus Stephanus}}; {{lang-sk|<U+0160>tefan I. or <U+0160>tefan Ve<U+013E>k<U+00FD>}}; {{circa}} 975 <U+2013> 15 August 1038 AD), was the last [[Grand Prince of the Hungarians]] between 997 and 1000 or 1001, and the first [[King of Hungary]] from 1000 or 1001 until his death in 1038. The year of his birth is uncertain, but many details of his life suggest that he was born in or after 975 in [[Esztergom]]. At his birth, he was given the pagan name '''Vajk'''. The date of his baptism is unknown. He was the only son of Grand Prince [[G<U+00E9>za, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|G<U+00E9>za]] and his wife, [[Sarolt]], who was descended from the prominent family of the ''[[Gyula (title)|gyulas]]''. Although both of his parents were baptized, Stephen was the first member of [[<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>ds|his family]] to become a devout Christian. He married [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela of Bavaria]], a scion of the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty]].

After succeeding his father in 997, Stephen had to fight for the throne against his relative, [[Kopp<U+00E1>ny]], who was supported by large numbers of pagan warriors. He defeated Kopp<U+00E1>ny mainly with the assistance of foreign knights, including [[Vecelin]], [[Hont-P<U+00E1>zm<U+00E1>ny#Notable members of the clan|Hont and P<U+00E1>zm<U+00E1>ny]], but also with help from native lords. He was crowned on 25 December 1000 or 1 January 1001 with a crown sent by [[Pope Sylvester II]]. In a series of wars against semi-independent tribes and chieftains{{mdash}}including the [[Black Hungarians]] and his uncle, [[Gyula III|Gyula the Younger]]{{mdash}}he unified the [[Carpathian Basin]]. He protected the independence of his kingdom by forcing the invading troops of [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor]], to withdraw from Hungary in 1030.

Stephen established at least one archbishopric, six bishoprics and three Benedictine monasteries; thus the Church in Hungary developed independently of the archbishops of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. He encouraged the spread of Christianity with severe punishments for ignoring Christian customs. His system of local administration was based on [[Counties of the Kingdom of Hungary|counties]] organized around fortresses and administered by [[Isp<U+00E1>n|royal officials]]. Hungary, which enjoyed a lasting period of peace during his reign, became a preferred route for [[pilgrims]] and merchants traveling between [[Western Europe]] and the [[Holy Land]] or [[Constantinople]].

He survived all of his children. He died on 15 August 1038 and was buried in his new basilica, built in [[Sz<U+00E9>kesfeh<U+00E9>rv<U+00E1>r]] and dedicated to the [[Holy Virgin]]. His death caused civil wars which lasted for decades. He was [[canonized]], together with his son, [[Saint Emeric of Hungary|Emeric]], and Bishop [[Gerardo Sagredo|Gerard of Csan<U+00E1>d]], in 1083. Stephen is a popular saint in Hungary and the neighboring territories. In Hungary, his [[feast day]] (celebrated on 20 August) is also a [[Public holidays in Hungary|public holiday]] commemorating the foundation of the state.

== Early years ({{circa}} 975<U+2013>997) ==

Stephen's birth date is uncertain because it was not recorded in contemporaneous documents.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=64}} Hungarian and Polish chronicles written centuries later give three different years: 967, 969 and 975.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=15}} The unanimous testimony of his three late 11th-century or early 12th-century [[hagiographies]] and other Hungarian sources, which state that Stephen was "still an adolescent" in 997,<ref>''Hartvic, Life of King Stephen of Hungary'' (ch. 5), p. 381.</ref> substantiate the reliability of the later year (975).{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=64}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=15}} Stephen's ''Lesser Legend'' adds that he was born in [[Esztergom]],{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=64}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=15}}<ref name=Britannica>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Stephen I|url=http://britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/565415/Stephen-I|encyclopedia=[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, Inc.|year=2008|accessdate=2008-07-29}}</ref> which implies that he was born after 972 because his father, [[G<U+00E9>za, Grand Prince of the Hungarians]], chose Esztergom as royal residence around that year.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=64}} G<U+00E9>za promoted the spread of Christianity among his subjects by force, but never ceased worshipping pagan gods.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=51}}{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=331}} Both his son's ''Greater Legend'' and the nearly contemporaneous [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] described G<U+00E9>za as a cruel monarch, suggesting that he was a despot who mercilessly consolidated his authority over the rebellious Hungarian lords.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=331}}{{sfn|Bakay|1999|p=547}}

Hungarian chronicles agree that Stephen's mother was [[Sarolt]], daughter of [[Gyula II|Gyula]], a [[gyula (title)|Hungarian chieftain]] with jurisdiction either in [[Transylvania]] or in the wider region of the confluence of the rivers [[Tisza]] and [[Mure<U+0219> River|Maros]].{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=44}}{{sfn|S<U+0103>l<U+0103>gean|2005|p=147}} Many historians{{mdash}}including P<U+00E1>l Engel and [[Gyula Krist<U+00F3>]]{{mdash}}propose that her father was identical with "Gylas", who had been baptized in [[Constantinople]] around 952 and "remained faithful to Christianity",<ref>''John Skylitzes: A Synopsis of Byzantine History, 811<U+2013>1057'' (ch. 11.5.), p. 231.</ref> according to Byzantine chronicler [[John Skylitzes]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=24}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=28}} However, this identification is not unanimously accepted; historian [[Gy<U+00F6>rgy Gy<U+00F6>rffy]] states that it was not Sarolt's father, but his younger brother, who was baptized in the Byzantine capital.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=44}} In contrast with all Hungarian sources, the ''[[Polish-Hungarian Chronicle]]'' and later [[Poles|Polish]] sources state that Stephen's mother was Adelhaid, an otherwise unknown sister of Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland]], but the reliability of this report is not accepted by modern historians.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=46}}

Stephen was born as [[Vajk (given name)|Vajk]],<ref name=Britannica/>{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=27}} a name derived from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] word ''baj'', meaning "hero", "master", "prince" or "rich".{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=15}}{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=46}} Stephen's ''Greater Legend'' narrates that he was baptized by the saintly Bishop [[Adalbert of Prague]],{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=78}} who stayed in G<U+00E9>za's court several times between 983 and 994.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=329}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=16}} However, Saint Adalbert's nearly contemporaneous ''Legend'', written by [[Bruno of Querfurt]], does not mention this event.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=78}}{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=329}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=16}} Accordingly, the date of Stephen's baptism is unknown: Gy<U+00F6>rffy argues that he was baptized soon after birth,{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=78}} while Krist<U+00F3> proposes that he only received baptism just before his father's death in 997.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=16}}

Stephen's official hagiography, written by Bishop [[Hartvik|Hartvic]] and sanctioned by [[Pope Innocent III]], narrates that he "was fully instructed in the knowledge of the grammatical art" in his childhood.<ref name=Hartvic>''Hartvic, Life of King Stephen of Hungary'' (ch. 4), p. 381.</ref>{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=15}} This implies that he studied Latin, though some scepticism is warranted as few kings of this era were able to write.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=15}} His two other late 11th-century hagiographies do not mention any grammatical studies, stating only that he "was brought up by receiving an education appropriate for a little prince".{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=15}} Krist<U+00F3> says that the latter remark only refers to Stephen's physical training, including his participation in hunts and military actions.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=15}} According to the ''Illuminated Chronicle'', one of his tutors was a Count Deodatus from [[Kingdom of Italy (imperial)|Italy]], who later founded a monastery in [[Tata, Hungary|Tata]].{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1983|p=132}}

According to Stephen's legends, Grand Prince G<U+00E9>za convoked an assembly of the Hungarian chieftains and warriors when Stephen "ascended to the first stage of adolescence",<ref name=Hartvic/> at the age of 14 or 15.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|pp=79<U+2013>80}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=17}} G<U+00E9>za nominated Stephen as his successor and all those present took an oath of loyalty to the young prince.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=17}} Gy<U+00F6>rffy also writes, without identifying his source, that G<U+00E9>za appointed his son to rule the "[[Principality of Nitra|Nyitra ducate]]" around that time.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=78}} Slovak historians, including J<U+00E1>n Steinh<U+00FC>bel and J<U+00E1>n Luka<U+010D>ka, accept Gy<U+00F6>rffy's view and propose that Stephen administered Nyitra (now [[Nitra]], Slovakia) from around 995.{{sfn|Steinh<U+00FC>bel|2011|p=19}}{{sfn|Luka<U+010D>ka|2011|p=31}}

G<U+00E9>za arranged Stephen's marriage, to [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], daughter of [[Henry the Wrangler]], [[Duke of Bavaria]], in or after 995.<ref name="Britannica" />{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|pp=16<U+2013>17}} This marriage established the first family link between a Hungarian ruler and a Western European ruling house,{{sfn|Moln<U+00E1>r|2001|p=20}} as Gisela was closely related to the [[Ottonian dynasty]] of [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=16}} According to popular tradition preserved in the [[Scheyern Abbey]] in [[Bavaria]], the ceremony took place at the [[Scheyern]] castle and was celebrated by Saint Adalbert.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=17}} Gisela was accompanied to her new home by Bavarian knights, many of whom received land grants from her husband and settled in Hungary,{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=81}} helping to strengthen Stephen's military position.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=18}} Gy<U+00F6>rffy writes that Stephen and his wife "presumably" settled in Nyitra after their marriage.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=81}}

Around 75 years after the coronation, [[Pope Gregory VII]] (r. 1075<U+2013>1085), who claimed suzerainty over Hungary, declared that Stephen had "offered and devotedly surrendered" Hungary "to [[Saint Peter]]" (that is to the [[Holy See]]).{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=343}}{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=96}}<ref>''Pope Gregory VII's letter to King Solomon of Hungary, claiming suzerainty over that kingdom'', p. 48.</ref> In a contrasting report, Stephen's ''Greater Legend'' states that the King offered Hungary to the [[Virgin Mary]].{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=96}} Modern historians{{mdash}}including P<U+00E1>l Engel, and Mikl<U+00F3>s Moln<U+00E1>r{{mdash}}write that Stephen always asserted his sovereignty and never accepted papal or imperial suzerainty.{{sfn|Moln<U+00E1>r|2001|p=20}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} For instance, none of his charters were dated according to the years of the reign of the contemporary emperors, which would have been the case if he had been their vassal.{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}} Furthermore, Stephen declared in the preamble to his ''First Book of Laws'' that he governed his realm "by the will of God".{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}<ref>''Laws of King Stephen I'' (Stephen I:Preface), p. 1.</ref>

The exact date of Stephen's coronation is unknown.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=22}} According to later Hungarian tradition, he was crowned on the first day of the second millennium, which may refer either to 25 December 1000 or to 1 January 1001.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=27}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|pp=22<U+2013>23}} Details of Stephen's coronation preserved in his ''Greater Legend'' suggest that the ceremony, which took place in Esztergom, followed the rite of the coronation of the German kings.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=98}} Accordingly, Stephen was [[Anointment|anointed]] with [[chrism|consecrated oil]] during the ceremony.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=98}} Stephen's portrait, preserved on his royal cloak from 1031, shows that his crown, like the Holy Roman Emperor's diadem, was a [[hoop crown]] decorated with [[gemstones]].{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=97}}

Besides his crown, Stephen regarded a spear with a flag as an important symbol of his sovereignty.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=97}} For instance, his first coins bear the inscription LANCEA REGIS ("the king's spear") and depict an arm holding a spear with flag.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=97}} According to the contemporaneous [[Ad<U+00E9>mar de Chabannes]], a spear had been given to Stephen's father by Emperor Otto III as a token of G<U+00E9>za's right to "enjoy the most freedom in the possession of his country".{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=41}} Stephen is styled in various ways{{mdash}}''Ungarorum rex'' ("king of the Hungarians"), ''Pannoniorum rex'' ("king of the Pannonians") or ''Hungarie rex'' ("king of Hungary"){{mdash}}in his charters.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=343}}

=== Consolidation (1001<U+2013>{{circa}} 1009) ===
Although Stephen's power did not rely on his coronation,{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=343}} the ceremony granted him the internationally accepted legitimacy of a Christian monarch who ruled his realm "[[by the Grace of God]]".{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=23}} All his legends testify that he established an [[Archdiocese of Esztergom|archbishopric with its see in Esztergom]] shortly after his coronation.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|2001|p=54}} This act ensured that the Church in Hungary became independent of the prelates of the Holy Roman Empire.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|2001|p=53}}{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=54}} The earliest reference to an archbishop of Esztergom, named [[Domonkos I, Archbishop of Esztergom|Domokos]], has been preserved in the deed of foundation of the Pannonhalma Archabbey from 1002.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|2001|p=54}} According to historian [[G<U+00E1>bor Thoroczkay]], Stephen also established the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kalocsa-Kecskem<U+00E9>t|Diocese of Kalocsa]] in 1001.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|2001|p=58}} Stephen invited foreign priests to Hungary to evangelize his kingdom.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p= 54}} Associates of the late Adalbert of Prague, including [[Radla]] and [[Astrik]], arrived in Hungary in the first years of his reign.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=336}}{{sfn|Thoroczkay|2001|pp=55<U+2013>57}} The presence of an unnamed "Archbishop of the Hungarians" at the [[synod]] of 1007 of [[Frankfurt]] and the consecration of an altar in [[Bamberg]] in 1012 by Archbishop Astrik show that Stephen's [[prelate]]s maintained a good relationship with the clergy of the Holy Roman Empire.{{sfn|Bakay|1999|p=547}}

The transformation of Hungary into a Christian state was one of Stephen's principal concerns throughout his reign.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=14}} Although the Hungarians' conversion had already begun in his father's reign, it was only Stephen who systematically forced his subjects to give up their pagan rituals.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|pp=331, 333}} His legislative activity was closely connected with Christianity.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=333}} For example, his ''First Book of Laws'' from the first years of his reign includes several provisions prescribing the observance of [[feast day]]s and the [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confession]] before death.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=334}}{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p= 135}} His other laws protected property rights{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=15}} and the interests of widows and orphans, or regulated the status of serfs.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p= 135}}

The ''Long Life of Saint Gerard'' mentions Stephen's conflict with [[Ajtony]], a chieftain in the region of the river [[Mure<U+0219> River|Maros]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=40}} Many historians date their clash to the end of the 1020s, although Gy<U+00F6>rffy{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=142}} and other scholars put it at least a decade earlier.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=40}} The conflict arose when Ajtony, who "had taken his power from the Greeks", according to Saint Gerard's legend, levied tax on the salt transported to Stephen on the river.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=101}} The king sent a large army led by [[Csan<U+00E1>d]] against Ajtony, who was killed in battle.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=142}} His lands were transformed into a Hungarian [[Csan<U+00E1>d County|county]] and the king set up a [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Szeged-Csan<U+00E1>d|new bishopric at Csan<U+00E1>d]] (Cenad, Romania), Ajtony's former capital, which was renamed after the commander of the royal army.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=142}} According to the ''[[Annales Posonienses]]'', the Venetian Gerard was consecrated as the first bishop of the new diocese in 1030.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|2001|p=62}}

=== Conflicts with the Holy Roman Empire (1024<U+2013>1031) ===

Stephen's brother-in-law, Emperor Henry, died on 13 July 1024.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=40}} He was succeeded by a distant relative,{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=187}} [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] (r. 1024<U+2013>1039), who adopted an offensive foreign policy.{{sfn|Lenkey|2003|p=90}} Conrad II expelled Doge Otto Orseolo{{mdash}}the husband of Stephen's sister{{mdash}}from Venice in 1026.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=148}}{{sfn|Lenkey|2003|p=90}} He also persuaded the Bavarians to proclaim his own son, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], as their duke in 1027, although Stephen's son, Emeric had a strong claim to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] through his mother.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=187}} Emperor Conrad planned a marriage alliance with the Byzantine Empire and dispatched one of his advisors, Bishop [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Werner of Strasbourg]], to Constantinople.{{sfn|Butler|Cumming|Burns|1998|p=159}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=197<U+2013>198}} In the autumn of 1027, the bishop seemingly travelled as a pilgrim, but Stephen, who had been informed of his actual purpose, refused to let him enter into his country.{{sfn|Butler|Cumming|Burns|1998|p=159}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=197<U+2013>198}} Conrad II's biographer [[Wipo of Burgundy]] narrated that the Bavarians incited skirmishes along the common borders of Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire in 1029, causing a rapid deterioration in relations between the two countries.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=149}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2003|p=74}}

Emperor Conrad personally led his armies to Hungary in June 1030 and plundered the lands west of the River [[R<U+00E1>ba]].{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=149}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=231}} However, according to the ''Annals of Niederalteich'', the emperor, suffering from consequences of the [[scorched earth]] tactics used by the Hungarian army,{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2003|pp=74<U+2013>75}} returned to Germany "without an army and without achieving anything, because the army was threatened by starvation and was captured by the Hungarians at [[Vienna]]".{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=231}} Peace was restored after Conrad had ceded the lands between the rivers [[Lajta]] and [[Fischa]] to Hungary in the summer of 1031.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|pp=149<U+2013>150}}

{{Quote|At this same time, dissensions arose between the Pannonian nation and the Bavarians, through the fault of the Bavarians. And, as a result, King [Stephen] of Hungary made many incursions and raids in the realm of the Norici (that is, of the Bavarians). Disturbed on this account Emperor Conrad came upon the Hungarians with a great army. But King [Stephen], whose forces were entirely insufficient to meet the Emperor, relied solely on the guardianship of the Lord, which he sought with prayers and fasts proclaimed through his whole realm. Since the Emperor was not able to enter a kingdom so [[gyep<U+00FC>|fortified with rivers and forests]], he returned, after he had sufficiently avenged his injury with lootings and burnings on the borders of the kingdom; and it was his wish at a more opportune time to complete the things he had begun. His son, King [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], however, still a young boy entrusted to the care of Eigilbert, [[bishop of Freising]], received a legation of King [Stephen] which asked for peace; and solely with the counsel of the princes of the realm, and without his father's knowledge, he granted the favor of reconciliation.|[[Wipo of Burgundy|Wipo]]: ''The Deeds of Conrad II''<ref>''The Deeds of Conrad II (Wipo)'' (ch. 26.), pp.&nbsp;85<U+2013>86.</ref>}}

=== Last years (1031<U+2013>1038) ===
[[File:Imrich stepan.jpg|thumb|right|alt=King St Stephen and his son|King Stephen at the funeral of his son, [[Saint Emeric of Hungary|Saint Emeric]]]]
Stephen's biographer, Hartvic, narrates that the King, whose children died one by one in infancy, "restrained the grief over their death by the solace on account of the love of his surviving son",<ref>''Hartvic, Life of King Stephen of Hungary'' (ch. 19), p. 390.</ref> [[Saint Emeric of Hungary|Emeric]].{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=48}} However, Emeric was wounded in a hunting accident and died in 1031.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=16}} After the death of his son, the elderly King could never "fully regain his former health",<ref>''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 45.69), p. 107.</ref> according to the ''Illuminated Chronicle''.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=48}} Krist<U+00F3> writes that the picture, which has been preserved in Stephen's legends, of the king keeping the [[vigils]] and washing the feet of paupers, is connected with Stephen's last years, following the death of his son.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=32}}

Emeric's death jeopardized his father's achievements in establishing a Christian state,{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=169}} because Stephen's cousin, [[Vazul]]{{mdash}}who had the strongest claim to succeed him{{mdash}}was suspected of an inclination towards paganism.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|pp=58<U+2013>59}} According to the ''[[Annales Altahenses|Annals of Altaich]]'' Stephen disregarded his cousin's claim and nominated his sister's son, the Venetian [[Peter Orseolo]], as his heir.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=170}} The same source adds that Vazul was captured and blinded, and his three sons, [[Levente]], [[Andrew I of Hungary|Andrew]] and [[B<U+00E9>la I of Hungary|B<U+00E9>la]], were expelled from Hungary.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=170}} Stephen's legends refer to an unsuccessful attempt upon the elderly king's life by members of his court.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=32}} According to Krist<U+00F3>, the legends refer to a plot in which Vazul participated and his mutilation was a punishment for this act.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=32}} That Vazul's ears were filled with molten lead was only recorded in later sources, including the ''Illuminated Chronicle''.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=32}}

In the view of some historians, provisions in Stephen's ''Second Book of Laws'' on the "conspiracy against the king and the kingdom" imply that the book was promulgated after Vazul's unsuccessful plot against Stephen.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=135}}<ref>''Laws of King Stephen I'' (Stephen II:19), p. 11.</ref> However, this view has not been universally accepted.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=135}} Gy<U+00F6>rffy states that the law book was issued, not after 1031, but around 1009.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=136}} Likewise, the authenticity of the decree on tithes is debated: according to Gy<U+00F6>rffy, it was issued during Stephen's reign, but Berend, Laszlovszky and Szak<U+00E1>cs argue that it "might be a later addition".{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=351}}{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=136}}

== Legacy ==

=== Founder of Hungary ===
Stephen has always been considered one of the most important statesmen in the history of Hungary.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=51}} His main achievement was the establishment of a Christian state that ensured that the Hungarians survived in the Carpathian Basin, in contrast to the [[Huns]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and other peoples who had previously controlled the same territory.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=51}} As Bryan Cartledge emphasizes, Stephen also gave his kingdom "forty years of relative peace and sound but unspectacular rule".{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=17}}

His successors, including those descended from Vazul, were eager to emphasize their devotion to Stephen's achievements.{{sfn|Lenkey|2003|p=106}} Although Vazul's son, [[Andrew I of Hungary]], secured the throne due to a [[Vata pagan uprising|pagan uprising]], he prohibited pagan rites and declared that his subjects should "live in all things according to the law which King St. Stephen had taught them", according to the 14th-century ''Illuminated Chronicle''.{{sfn|Lenkey|2003|p=106}}<ref>''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 60.86), p. 113.</ref> In [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000<U+2013>1526)|medieval Hungary]], communities that claimed a privileged status or attempted to preserve their own "[[Privilege (law)|liberties]]" often declared that the origin of their special status was to be attributed to King Saint Stephen.{{sfn|Tringli|2001|p=129}} An example is a 1347 letter from the people of [[T<U+00E1>p]] telling the king about their grievances against the Pannonhalma Archabbey and stating that the taxes levied upon them by the abbot contradicted "the liberty granted to them in the time of King Saint Stephen".{{sfn|Tringli|2001|p=139}}

Stephen's canonization was initiated by Vazul's grandson, King [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]], who had consolidated his authority by capturing and imprisoning his cousin, [[Solomon, King of Hungary|Solomon]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=32-33}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=35}} According to Bishop Hartvic, the canonization was "decreed by apostolic letter, by order of the Roman see",<ref>''Hartvic, Life of King Stephen of Hungary'' (ch. 24.), p. 393.</ref> suggesting that the ceremony was permitted by Pope Gregory VII.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=125}} The ceremony started at Stephen's tomb, where on 15 August 1083 masses of believers began three days of fasting and praying.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=124}} Legend tells that Stephen's coffin could not be opened until King Ladislaus held Solomon in captivity at [[Visegr<U+00E1>d]].{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=124}} The opening of Stephen's tomb was followed by the occurrence of healing miracles, according to Stephen's legends.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=35}} Historian Krist<U+00F3> attributes the healings either to [[Folie <U+00E0> deux|mass psychosis]] or deception.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=35}} Stephen's legends also say that his "balsam-scented" remains were elevated from the coffin, which was filled with "rose-colored water", on 20 August.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=124}} On the same day, Stephen's son, Emeric, and the bishop of Csan<U+00E1>d, Gerard, were also canonized.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=33}}

=== Holy Dexter ===

Stephen's intact dexter, or right hand ({{lang-hu|Szent Jobb}}), became the subject of a cult.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=33}}{{sfn|Csorba|2004|p=7}} A cleric named Mercurius stole it, but it was discovered on 30 May 1184 in [[Bihar County]].{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=124}} The theft of sacred relics, or ''furta sacra'', had by that time become a popular topic of saints' biographies.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=146}} Bishop Hartvic described the discovery of Stephen's right hand in accordance with this tradition, referring to adventures and visions.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=146}} An abbey erected in Bihar County (now [[S<U+00E2>niob]], Romania) was named after and dedicated to the veneration of the Holy Dexter.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=33}}

{{Quote|Why is it, brothers, that his other limbs having become disjointed and, his flesh having been reduced to dust, wholly separated, only the right hand, its skin and [[sinews]] adhering to the bones, preserved the beauty of wholeness? I surmise that the inscrutability of divine judgement sought to proclaim by the extraordinary nature of this fact nothing less than that the work of love and alms surpasses the measure of all other virtues.&nbsp;... The right hand of the blessed man was deservedly exempt from [[putrefaction]], because always reflourishing from the flower of kindness it was never empty from giving gifts to nourish the poor.|''Hartvic, Life of King Stephen of Hungary''<ref>''Hartvic, Life of King Stephen of Hungary'' (ch. 27.), p. 396.</ref>}}

The Holy Dexter was kept for centuries in the Szentjobb Abbey, except during the Mongol invasion of 1241 and 1242, when it was transferred to Ragusa (now [[Dubrovnik]], Croatia).{{sfn|Csorba|2004|p=7}} The relic was then taken to Sz<U+00E9>kesfeh<U+00E9>rv<U+00E1>r around 1420.{{sfn|Csorba|2004|p=7}} Following the [[Ottoman Hungary|Ottoman occupation]] of the central territories of the Kingdom of Hungary in the mid-16th&nbsp;century, it was guarded in many places, including [[Bosnia]], Ragusa and Vienna.<ref name='Szent_Jobb'>{{cite web |title=A Szent Jobb t<U+00F6>rt<U+00E9>nete [History of the Holy Dexter]  |work=Szent Istv<U+00E1>n Bazilika: T<U+00F6>rt<U+00E9>net [St. Stephen's Basilica: History] |publisher=http://www.bazilika.biz |year= 1991 |url=http://www.bazilika.biz/a-szent-jobb-tortenete/a-szent-jobb-tortenete |accessdate=2013-08-19}}</ref> It was returned to Hungary in 1771, when Queen [[Maria Theresa]] donated it to the cloister of the [[Sisters of Loreto]] in Buda.<ref name='Szent_Jobb'/> It was kept in [[Buda Castle]]'s St. Sigismund Chapel between around 1900 and 1944, in a cave near [[Salzburg]] in 1944 and 1945, and again by the Sisters of Loreto in Buda, between 1945 and 1950. Finally, since 1950, the Holy Dexter has been in [[St. Stephen's Basilica]] in Budapest.<ref name='Szent_Jobb'/> An annual procession celebrating the relic was instituted in 1938, and continued until 1950, when the procession was forbidden by the Communist government.<ref name='Szent_Jobb'/> It was resumed in 1988.<ref name='Szent_Jobb'/>

=== ''Admonitions'' ===
According to Stephen's ''Greater Legend'', the king "himself compiled a book for his son on moral education".{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|pp=166<U+2013>167}} This work, now known as ''Admonitions'' or ''De institutione morum'',{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=166}} was preserved in manuscripts written in the [[Late Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=343}} Although scholars debate whether it can actually be attributed to the king or a cleric, most of them agree that it was composed in the first decades of the 11th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=343}}{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=167}}

The ''Admonitions'' argues that kingship is inseparably connected with the Catholic faith.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=343}}{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=167}} Its author emphasized that a monarch is required to make donations to the Church and regularly consult his prelates, but is entitled to punish clergymen who do wrong.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=343}} One of its basic ideas was that a sovereign has to cooperate with the "pillars of his rule", meaning the prelates, aristocrats, ''isp<U+00E1>ns'' and warriors.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=167}}

{{Quote|My dearest son, if you desire to honor the royal crown, I advise, I counsel, I urge you above all things to maintain the Catholic and Apostolic faith with such diligence and care that you may be an example for all those placed under you by God, and that all the clergy may rightly call you a man of true Christian profession. Failing to do this, you may be sure that you will not be called a Christian or a son of the Church. Indeed, in the royal palace, after the faith itself, the Church holds second place, first constituted and spread through the whole world by His members, the apostles and holy fathers, And though she always produced fresh offspring, nevertheless in certain places she is regarded as ancient. However, dearest son, even now in our kingdom the Church is proclaimed as young and newly planted; and for that reason she needs more prudent and trustworthy guardians lest a benefit which the divine mercy bestowed on us undeservedly should be destroyed and annihilated through your idleness, indolence or neglect.|Stephen's ''Admonitions'' to his son, Emeric{{sfn|O'Malley|1995|pp=46<U+2013>47}}}}
