The '''D class cruisers''' were a pair of cruisers, classified as ''Panzerschiffe'' ("armored ships") by the [[Kriegsmarine]]. The ships were improved versions of the preceding {{sclass|Deutschland|cruiser|2}}s, authorized by [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1933. They were intended to counter a new French naval construction program. Displacement increased to {{convert|20000|LT}}, but Hitler allowed only increases to armor, prohibiting additions to the ships' main battery. Only one of the two ships was laid down, but it was canceled less than five months after the keel was laid. It was determined that the designs should be enlarged to counter the new French {{sclass|Dunkerque|battleship|4}} ships. The construction contracts for both ships were superseded by the {{sclass|Scharnhorst|battleship|1}}s.<ref name=G63>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 63</ref>

==Design==
The ships were designed as follow-ons to the ''Deutschland'' class cruisers.<ref name=G63/> In 1933, the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] brought [[Adolf Hitler]] to power in Germany. At the time, he opposed a large-scale naval rearmament program, but decided to allow limited construction to counter French naval expansion. He therefore authorized the Kriegsmarine to build two additional ''panzerschiffe'' (armored ships) to supplement the three ''Deutschland''s. He stipulated that displacement be limited to {{convert|19000|LT}} and the primary battery would remain two triple turrets mounting {{convert|28|cm|abbr=on}} guns.<ref name=GD128>Garzke & Dulin, p. 128</ref> Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], the commander in chief of the Kriegsmarine, advocated increasing the armor protection for the new ''panzershiffe'' and inquired about the possibility of including a third triple turret. It was determined, however, that a third turret could not be added to the ship and still remain within the 19,000&nbsp;ton limit prescribed by Hitler.<ref name=GD130>Garzke & Dulin, p. 130</ref>

The ships were designed under the contract names D and E, and designed under the provisional names ''Ersatz Elsass'' and ''Ersatz Hessen'' as replacements for the old [[pre-dreadnought]]s {{SMS|Elsass}} and {{SMS|Hessen}}. The contract for the first ship, D, was awarded on 25 January 1934 to the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven|Kriegsmarinewerft]] in [[Wilhelmshaven]]. The ship's [[keel]] was laid on 14 February<ref name=G63/> That month, the Kriegsmarine decided to alter the designs to counter the new {{sclass|Dunkerque|battleship|4}} ships building in France. Displacement was increased to {{convert|26000|LT}} and a third 28&nbsp;cm triple-turret was added.<ref name=GD128/> Construction on D was therefore halted on 5 July, and E was never laid down. The construction contracts were canceled and reallocated for the two battleships of the {{sclass|Scharnhorst|battleship|4}}.<ref name=G63/>

===Characteristics===
The ships were {{convert|230|m|ft|sp=us}} [[Length overall|long overall]], and {{convert|225|m|ft|abbr=on}} at the [[Length at the waterline|waterline]]. The ships would have had a breadth of {{convert|25.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a draft of {{convert|8.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The finalized design displaced {{convert|20000|LT}} at the designed displacement. "D" was to have been fitted with accommodations to serve as a fleet [[flagship]]. The ships would have been turbine-powered; the engines were designed to provide {{convert|125000|shp|lk=in}} and a top speed of 29&nbsp;knots.<ref name=G63/>

The ships would have been similarly equipped to the preceding ''Deutschland'' class ships. The ships would have mounted six of the same [[28 cm SK C/28 naval gun|{{convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on}}/52 C/28]] quick-firing guns in the same triple turret mounts.<ref name=G63/> The guns had an actual bore diameter of {{convert|28.3|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and fired both [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] and high-explosive shells; both shells weighed 300&nbsp;kg (661.4&nbsp;lb). The guns used two sets of propellant charges: a 36.0&nbsp;kg (79.4&nbsp;lb) fore charge in a silk bag and a 71.0&nbsp;kg (156.6&nbsp;lb) main charge in a brass case. The shells were fired at 910&nbsp;meters per second (2,986&nbsp;fps), and at maximum elevation of 40&nbsp;degrees, a range of 36,475&nbsp;m (39,890&nbsp;yards). The guns had a rate of fire of 2.5 rounds per minute.<ref>{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = Germany 28 cm/52 (11") SK C/28  | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_11-52_skc28.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 28 December 2008 | accessdate = 1 April 2009 }}</ref> However, eight guns were considered, had there been a quadruple turret available. The guns were supplied by a total of 900 shells, for a total of 150 rounds per gun. 

The design's secondary battery comprised eight [[15 cm SK C/28|{{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}}/55 SK C/28]] quick-firing guns.<ref name=G63/> The guns fired a {{convert|45.3|kg|abbr=on}} shells at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|875|m2|abbr=on}}. With a maximum elevation of 40<U+00B0>, the guns could fire out to {{convert|23000|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Campbell, p. 241</ref> These guns had already been ordered by the time construction of the ships was canceled; their availability influenced the design of the ''Scharnhorst'' class,<ref name=GD130/> which mounted eight of their twelve 15&nbsp;cm guns in dual turrets.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 31&ndash;32</ref>

The heavy anti-aircraft battery consisted of eight [[10.5 cm FlaK 38|{{convert|10.5|cm|abbr=on}} SK C/33]] guns in twin mountings.<ref name=G63/> The mounts were the Dopp LC/31 type, originally designed for earlier [[8.8 cm SK C/31 naval gun|{{convert|8.8|cm|abbr=on}} SK C/31 guns]]. The LC/31 mounting was triaxially-stabilized and capable of elevating to 80<U+00B0>. This enabled the guns to engage targets up to a ceiling of {{convert|12500|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Against surface targets, the guns had a maximum range of {{convert|17700|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Campbell, p. 247</ref> The guns fired fixed ammunition weighing {{convert|15.1|kg|abbr=on}}; the guns could fire HE and HE incendiary rounds, as well as illumination shells.<ref name=C248>Campbell, p. 248</ref> A number of various other anti-aircraft guns were also to be fitted, but the details were not determined before the class was canceled. The ships were also armed with an unknown number of {{convert|53.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes.<ref name=G63/>

The D class ships used steel manufactured by [[Krupp]] for their armor. The ships' upper deck armor was {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick. The main armored deck was {{convert|70|mm|in|abbr=on}} forward, {{convert|80|mm|in|abbr=on}} amidships, and decreased to 70&nbsp;mm towards the stern. The [[conning tower]] was quite heavily armored, with side armor {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick. The main [[Belt armor|armored belt]] was {{convert|220|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and the citadel armor was {{convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=G63/>
