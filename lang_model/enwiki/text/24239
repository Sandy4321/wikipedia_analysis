'''''Watchmen''''' is a twelve-issue [[comic book]] written by [[Alan Moore]] and illustrated by [[Dave Gibbons]]. Originally published by [[DC Comics]] as a monthly [[limited series]] from 1986 to 1987,<ref name="Time Magazine">[http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/0,24459,watchmen,00.html "Time Magazine - ALL-TIME 100 Novels"] <U+2014>

''Watchmen'' is the only graphic novel to have won a [[Hugo Award]],<ref name="Hugo Award"> [http://dpsinfo.com/awardweb/hugos/80s.html "AwardWeb: Hugo Award Winners"] - ''Watchmen'' listed as a winner of the [[Hugo Award]] (retrieved [[20 April]] [[2006]]) </ref> and is also the only graphic novel to appear on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of "100 best novels from 1923 to present."<ref name="Time Magazine" />

''Watchmen'' is set in 1985 in an [[alternative history]] [[United States]] where costumed adventurers are real and the country is edging closer to a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] with the [[Soviet Union]]. It tells the story of the last remaining superheroes and the events surrounding the mysterious murder of one of their own. In ''Watchmen'', superheroes are presented as real people who must confront ethical and personal issues, who have neuroses and failings, and who are largely lacking in [[superpower]]s. ''Watchmen''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Superhero#Deconstruction of the superhero|deconstruction]] of the conventional superhero archetype, combined with its innovative adaptation of [[cinematic techniques]] and heavy use of [[symbolism]] and multi-layered dialogue, have had a profound effect on later comics.

==Background==
Alan Moore, who wanted to transcend the perceptions of the comic book medium as something juvenile, attempted "to create [with ''Watchmen''] <U+2018>a superhero [[Moby Dick]]; something that had that sort of weight, that sort of density.<U+2019>"<ref name="Strange Things Interview"> [http://www.johncoulthart.com/feuilleton/?p=53 "Alan Moore Interview 1988"] Johncoulthart.com (retrieved [[06 June]] [[2006]])</ref> Moore also named [[William Burroughs]] as one of his "main influences" during the conception of ''Watchmen'', and admired Burroughs' use "of repeated symbols that would become laden with meaning" in Burroughs' one and only comic strip, which appeared in the British underground magazine ''Cyclops''.<ref name="Strange Things Interview"> [http://www.johncoulthart.com/feuilleton/?p=53 "Alan Moore Interview 1988"] Johncoulthart.com (retrieved [[06 June]] [[2006]])</ref> 

In developing ''Watchmen'', during its embryonic stage, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons originally conceived of a story that would take "familiar old-fashioned superheroes into a completely new realm."<ref name="Blather Moore Interview"> [http://www.blather.net/articles/amoore/watchmen2.html "The Alan Moore Interview"] Blather.net  (retrieved [[06 June]] [[2006]])</ref> [[Dick Giordano]], who had worked for [[Charlton Comics]], suggested using a cast of old Charlton characters that had recently been acquired by DC, but since Moore and Gibbons wanted to do a serious story-line in which some of the newly acquired characters would die, this was not feasible. Giordano then suggested that Moore and Gibbons simply start from scratch and create their own characters. So while certain characters in ''Watchmen'' are loosely based upon the Charlton characters (such as [[Dr. Manhattan]] who was inspired by [[Captain Atom]] and [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] who was loosely based upon [[Question (comics)|the Question]]), Moore decided to create characters that ultimately would scarcely resemble their Charlton counterparts. 

Originally, Moore and Gibbons only had enough plot for six issues, so they compensated "by interspersing the more plot-driven issues with issues that gave kind of a biographical portrait of one of the main characters."<ref name="Locus Moore Interview"> [http://www.locusmag.com/2003/Issue07/Moore.html "In League with Alan Moore"] Locus Online (retrieved [[06 June]] [[2006]])</ref> During the process, Dave Gibbons had a great deal of autonomy in developing the visual look of ''Watchmen'' and inserted details that Moore admits he did not notice until later, as ''Watchmen'' was written to be read and fully understood after several readings.<ref name="Strange Things Interview"> [http://www.johncoulthart.com/feuilleton/?p=53 "Alan Moore Interview 1988"] Johncoulthart.com (retrieved [[06 June]] [[2006]])</ref>

==Composition==
===Title===
The title ''Watchmen'' is derived from the phrase ''quis custodiet ipsos custodes'', from [[Juvenal]]'s [[Satire VI]] "Against women" (c. 60-127 CE), often translated as "who watches the watchmen?"

{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
<div style="font-size: 95%">
:''noui consilia et ueteres quaecumque monetis amici,''
:''"pone seram, cohibe".'' 
:''sed '''quis custodiet ipsos custodes'''''
:''cauta est et ab illis incipit uxor''
</div>
{{col-2}}
<div style="font-size: 95%">
:"I hear always the admonishment of my friends:
:'Bolt her in, and constrain her!'
:But '''who will watch the watchmen'''?
:The wife arranges accordingly, and begins with them."
</div>
{{col-end}}

Juvenal was credited with "exposing" the vice of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman society]] through his expository [[satire]]s,<ref name="Satire"> [http://encarta.msn.com/text_761553428__1/Satire.html "MSN Encarta: Satire"] - A discussion on "Satire" (retrieved [[14 April]] [[2006]])</ref> and in a similar fashion, ''Watchmen'' examines the trope of the costumed adventurer, or [[superhero]], by examining the human flaws of its "superhero" characters in lieu of the traditional comic book focus on its characters' strengths.<ref name="superhero"> [http://www.ninthart.com/printdisplay.php?article=711 "Ninth Art - Alan Moore"] - retrieved [[20 April]] [[2006]] </ref>  In ''Watchmen'', Moore shows a "grittier" side to the conceived notion of the superhero.<ref name="The Craft Interview"> [http://www.enginecomics.co.uk/interviews/jan05/alanmoore.htm "The Craft - an interview with Alan Moore"] (retrieved [[14 April]] [[2006]])</ref>

The [[graffiti]] "WHO WATCHES THE WATCHMEN" appears scrawled upon walls throughout [[New York City]] during the story, but the complete phrase is never seen; the sentence is always partially obscured or cut out of the panel. The graffiti occurs following the proposition of The Keene Act, depicting the change of public opinion towards the practice of [[vigilantism]]. This viewpoint is exemplified by the character of the second Nite Owl, who asks, during an anti-[[vigilantism]] riot, "who are we protecting [society] from?"<ref name="Watchmen pg17"> - '''Watchmen''' page 17, panel 6 (ISBN 0930289234)</ref> As if to illustrate the many problems with vigilantes who sometimes serve as judge, jury and executioner, the Comedian glibly replies, "From themselves."<ref name="Watchmen pg17"> - '''Watchmen''' page 17, panel 7 (ISBN 0930289234)</ref>

===Structure===
The [[graphic novel]] ''Watchmen'' is composed of twelve chapters. These chapters were originally separate issues of the [[limited series|comic book series]], which were released sequentially in 1986. Each chapter begins with a [[close-up]] of the first panel, originally the cover to each issue. An excerpt of a famous [[quote]] or song [[lyrics|lyric]] appears in the preliminary stages of the chapter, acting as the chapter's heading or title. The quote is given in its entirety at the end of the chapter, summarising the events that have just occurred. 

Moreover, ''Watchmen'' also contains many [[False document|fictional primary documents]], which are appended at the end of every chapter (except the final one), as being a part of the ''Watchmen'' universe's media. Biographies of retired costumed adventurers, such as the retrospective ''Under the Hood'' by the retired first Nite Owl, are used to help the reader understand the chronology of events, and also changing public opinion and representation of costumed adventurers through the decades. These documents are also used to reveal personal details of the costumed adventurers' private lives, such as Rorschach's arrest record and psychiatric report. Other documents include military reports (of Dr. Manhattan) and newspaper and magazine articles (from ''New Frontiersman'' and ''Nova Express'') that are also used in this way. 

''Watchmen'''s structure has been analysed by many reviewers, with ''The Friday Review'' calling ''Watchmen'', "a complex, multi-layered narrative, populated with well-realised characters and set against a background that is simultaneously believable and unfamiliar".<ref name="The Friday Review">[http://www.ninthart.com/display.php?article=714 "The Friday Review"] A review of ''Watchmen'' - (retrieved [[14 April]] [[2006]])</ref>

===Perspective===
When reading ''Watchmen'', the reader often assumes the role of [[Narrator|third person omniscience]], able to see all of the characters' actions, as well as what they may be thinking, which are depicted through facial expressions and body language. Moreover, ''Watchmen'' is unconventional in that it does not rely heavily on the "standard" technique in the [[comic book]] genre of employing [[thought balloons]] to demonstrate its characters' thoughts,<ref name="Thought Balloon"> [http://www.fanboyradio.com/columns_view.php?c=26 "Fanboy Radio"] - a discussion on the [[thought balloon]] in [[comic book]]s (retrieved [[20 April]] [[2006]] </ref> although several sections comprise large episodes dedicated to the characters' thoughts. The documents that are appended to the end of each chapter (except the last), as well as media such as Rorschach's diary, help to elucidate characters' thoughts and feelings throughout the novel, without mentioning them explicitly.<ref name="Shotgun Review"> [http://www.shotgunreviews.com/comics/watchmen_graduate.html "Shotgun Reviews"] - an essay discussing '''Watchmen''' (retrieved [[20 April]] [[2006]]) </ref>

The [[Narrator|first person perspective]] is also utilised, albeit more infrequently. [[Flashback (literary technique)|Flashbacks]] are employed to help facilitate the reader's understanding of events occurring in the present, but also as a means of chronicling the differences in history between the ''Watchmen'' universe and our own. Thus, Dr. Manhattan's flashback to the [[Vietnam War]] highlights how both his and the Comedian's existence altered their world's history in comparison to our own.<ref name="Watchmen pg 19 & 20">''Watchmen pages 19 & 20 </ref> 

"Watchmen Observations" notes that Watchmen uses a three by three panel structure, and that there is little variation in this format, the effect is to, "reduce the scope for authorial voice--the reader has fewer clues how she should react to each scene; also, they heighten the feeling of realism and distance the novel from standard action comics."

{{main|Characters in Watchmen}}
The cast of ''Watchmen'' was initially based upon old [[Charlton Comics]] characters. [[Alan Moore|Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons|Gibbons]] agreed that ''Watchmen'' required a cast of characters that had continuity and a history upon which a story could be based. [[DC Comics]] had recently acquired the rights to some old Charlton Comics characters. This prompted former DC Editing Manager [[Dick Giordano]] to suggest that Moore use some of these characters. However, to avoid continuity issues with the recently acquired characters, and due to the fact that some of them would have become useless for future series, Moore decided to create new characters, using the recently acquired Charlton Comics characters as a template. This allowed for a more dynamic and unique set of characters. [[Comedian (comics)|The Comedian]] (Edward Blake) is based on [[Peacemaker (comics)|Peacemaker]] with elements of [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Nick Fury]]. [[Doctor Manhattan]] (Jon Osterman) is derived from [[Captain Atom]], while the first and second [[Nite Owl]]s (Hollis Mason and Dan Dreiberg) are based upon [[Blue Beetle]]. [[Peter Cannon, Thunderbolt|Thunderbolt]] serves as the inspiration for [[Ozymandias (comics)|Ozymandias]] (Adrian Veidt), while the [[Question (comics)|Question]] and [[Mr. A]] did the same for [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] (Walter Kovacs). Finally, the first and second [[Silk Spectre]]s (Sally Jupiter and Laurie Juspeczyk) are based on [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]] with elements of [[Black Canary]] and [[Phantom Lady]].<ref name="Characters2">[http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/09moore.html "Alan Moore Interview - Comic Book Artist #9"] <U+2014> An interview with Alan Moore (retrieved [[14 April]] [[2006]])</ref><ref name="Characters">[http://surbrook.devermore.net/adaptionscomic/watchmen/watchmenintro.html "Watchmen <U+2014> Introduction"] <U+2014> An overview of the plot and characters in ''Watchmen'' (retrieved [[12 March]] [[2006]])</ref>

===Plot summary===
{{spoiler}}
{{further|[[Chapters in Watchmen]]}}

In October 1985, Walter Kovacs (Rorschach) investigates the [[murder]] of [[New York City|New York]]er Edward Blake and discovers that Blake was the "Comedian", a veteran costumed adventurer and government agent. Forming a theory that Blake's murder is part of a greater plot to eliminate costumed adventurers (or "masks," as Rorschach calls them), Kovacs warns others: Jon Osterman (Dr. Manhattan), Laurel Jane Juspeczyk (second Silk Spectre), Dan Dreiberg (second Nite Owl) and Adrian Veidt (Ozymandias). Veidt, Juspeczyk and Dreiberg are long retired from crime-fighting, the latter two because of the 1977 passage of the Keene Act, which banned costumed vigilantes (a law that Kovacs, deeply immersed in his Rorschach identity and moral code, ignores), and Veidt had retired voluntarily in 1975, disclosing his identity publicly and using his reputation and intelligence to build a successful commercial enterprise, as well as a large personal fortune. Like Blake, Osterman remained exempt from the Keene Act, being an agent of the U.S. government, though he no longer engages in crimefighting, rather having become an important element of the ongoing [[Cold War]].

The [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] have been edging toward a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear showdown]] since the 1959 nuclear accident that transformed Osterman into the super-powered Dr. Manhattan. Due to Osterman's allegiance, the U.S. has enjoyed a distinct strategic advantage, allowing it to defeat the Soviet Union in a series of [[proxy war]]s -- most notably in [[Vietnam]]. This imbalance has dramatically increased global tension. In seeming anticipation of global war, American society has assumed a general sense of [[fatalism]] about the future. Signs of this in daily life range from "Meltdowns" candy to [[graffiti]] inspired by the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima bombing]] to the designation of many buildings in New York as [[fallout shelter]]s.

Veidt, observing Osterman's increasing emotional detachment from humanity, forms a theory that military expenditures and environmental damage will lead to global catastrophe no later than the mid-1990s. As part of an elaborate plot to avert this, Veidt acts to accelerate Osterman's isolation by secretly exposing more than two dozen of Osterman's former associates to harmful radiation, inflicting a variety of [[cancer]]s on them.  Meanwhile, Veidt manipulates the press into speculating that Osterman himself was the cause of these cancers.

Now hounded by media allegations and [[quarantine]]d as a result, Osterman [[teleport]]s himself to [[Mars (planet)|the planet Mars]] to contemplate the events of his life. His break with the U.S. government prompts Soviet opportunism in the form of an invasion of [[Afghanistan]] (a delayed version of the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|real-life event]]), greatly aggravating the global crisis; as the situation continues to escalate, the U.S. government and public alike realize that nuclear war would be only days away. Investigating the calamities that have befallen other heroes, Dreiberg and Kovacs discover information incriminating Veidt; Kovacs, Juspeczyk, Osterman and Dreiberg confront Veidt at his [[Antarctic]] retreat, but too late to prevent the final phase of his plan. Using a teleportation device, Veidt moves a massive, [[genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]], [[psionics|psionic]] creature into the heart of New York City, knowing that the teleportation process would kill it. In its death-throes, the creature releases a "psychic shockwave" containing imagery designed to be so violent and alien as to kill half the residents of the city, drive many survivors insane, and convince others worldwide that the creature is the first of a potential alien invasion force. Thus presented with an extraterrestrial threat, the United States and Soviet Union withdraw from the brink of war and form an accord to face this apparent menace.

The murderer of Blake is revealed to be Veidt himself, acting after Blake had accidentally discovered details of Veidt's plot. Veidt has also eliminated numerous employees and minions. At the end, the only people aware of the truth are Veidt, Dreiberg, Juspeczyk, Kovacs and Osterman.  Dreiberg, Juspeczyk and Osterman agree to keep silent out of concern that revealing the plot could re-ignite U.S.<U+2013>Soviet tensions, but Kovacs refuses to compromise and is killed by Osterman.

The ending is deliberately ambiguous about the long-term success of Veidt's plan to lead the world to [[utopia]]. After killing Kovacs, Osterman talks briefly to Veidt. Professing his guilt and doubt, Veidt asks the [[Omniscience|omniscient]] Osterman for closure: "I did the right thing, didn't I? It all worked out in the end." Osterman, standing within Veidt's [[orrery]], replies cryptically: "In the end? Nothing ends, Adrian. Nothing ever ends." He then disappears, leaving Earth forever, his departure leaving the [[solar system]] model in the orrery framed by a residue appearing distinctly similar to an atomic [[mushroom cloud]].

However, before confronting Veidt, Kovacs had mailed his journal detailing his suspicions to ''The New Frontiersman'', a [[far right|far right-wing]] magazine Kovacs frequently read. The final frame of the series shows a ''New Frontiersman'' editor contemplating which item from the "[[crank (person)|crank file]]" (to which Kovacs's journal had been consigned) to use as filler for the upcoming issue.

===''Tales of the Black Freighter''===
[[Image:Blackfreighter.gif|thumb|left|100px|{{ifdc|July_20}}<br />A panel from ''The Black Freighter'', a comic book set in the ''Watchmen'' universe.]]

''Tales of the Black Freighter'' is a [[comic book]] within the ''Watchmen'' universe. The specific issues shown in ''Watchmen'' chronicle a [[castaway]]'s attempts to return home to warn his family of the arrival of the Black Freighter, a phantom [[Piracy|pirate ship]] which houses the souls of the dead. As the man's journey progresses, he becomes more and more unscrupulous, attempting to justify his increasingly irrational, [[paranoid]] disposition, and his criminal acts.

A pirate comic book was conceived by Moore because he and Gibbons thought that since the inhabitants of the ''Watchmen'' universe experience superheroes in real life, then "they probably wouldn't be at all interested in superhero comics."<ref name="Moore Interview">[http://www.blather.net/articles/amoore/watchmen3.html "The Alan Moore Interview: Watchmen, microcosms and details"] <U+2014> An interview with Alan Moore (retrieved [[14 April]] [[2006]])</ref> A pirate theme was suggested by Gibbons, and Moore agreed because he is "a big [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] fan." 

The comic is being read by a teenage boy whilst he sits beside a [[Newsagent|newsstand]], whose proprietor, meanwhile, contemplates the latest news headlines and discusses them with his customers. This juxtaposition of text and images from the [[story within a story]] and its [[Frame story|framing sequence]] uses the former to act as a parallel commentary to the latter <U+2014> which is the plot of ''Watchmen'' itself.<ref name="Vendor"> [http://www.challengingdestiny.com/reviews/graphicnovels.htm "Review of Graphic Novels"] <U+2014> A review which describes ''Tales of the Black Freighter'' (retrieved [[14 April]] [[2006]])</ref> Specifically, Moore has said that the story of ''The Black Freighter'' ends up describing "the story of Adrian Veidt". In addition, the comic can also be seen to "[relate] to Rorschach and his capture; it relates to the self-marooning of Dr. Manhattan on Mars; it can be used as a counterpoint to all these different parts of the story".<ref name="Moore Interview" /> Moore also intended the opening panel in Chapter III to reinforce the reader's identification with the [[Radioactive contamination|radioactive warning]] [[trefoil]]; [[Alan Moore|Moore]] thought that the close-up of the trefoil in the first panel looked like a "stylised picture of a black ship". The trefoil then came to represent "a black ship against a yellow sky".

==Artwork==
[[Penciller]] and [[inker]] [[Dave Gibbons]] and [[colorist]] [[John Higgins (comics)|John Higgins]] have been credited with giving life to the various characters in ''Watchmen''.  They employed a variety of innovative techniques, a style that contained elements of the [[Golden Age of Comics]] and a deliberate attempt to inject cinematic realism, uncommon in comic-books in the 1980s. Gibbons, who had worked with Moore on previous occasions, including a notable 1985 ''[[Superman]]'' story (Annual 11, 'For the Man who has Everything'), avoided convention in his work and literally developed a storyboard-style to the dialogue written by Moore. Nearly every panel included significant details to the story-line or were indicative of running [[Symbolism]] symbols (such as triangles and pyramids) with themes important to the plot.<ref name="Symbols"> [http://www.stahl.bau.tu-bs.de/~hildeb/watchmen/annotations/watchmen.01.shtml "The Annotated Watchmen, Chapter 1: "At Midnight, All the Agents...""] <U+2014> A panel by panel analysis of Watchmen by Ralf Hildebrandt (retrieved [[02 June]] [[2006]])</ref> Gregory J.

Instead, [[Dave Gibbons|Gibbons]] uses "posture and blood" to highlight the motion and movement of the characters, which "[adds] to the feel of realism and [limits the] authorial voice" <ref name="Watchmen Observations"> [http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sjblatt/watchmen/o.html "Watchmen Observations"] - retrieved ([[22 April]] [[2006]])</ref> Also missing are the written, onomatopoetic sound effects that are a traditional comic book storytelling technique.

Gibbons also described his design of the characters as his own, derived from Moore's character notes. Moore credits Gibbons with coming up with many of the signature symbols in ''Watchmen'', including the iconic [[Smiley|smiley face]], which was "derived from behavioural psychology tests. They tried to find the simplest abstraction that would make a baby smile."<ref name="Strange Things Interview"> [http://www.johncoulthart.com/feuilleton/?p=53 "Alan Moore Interview 1988"] Johncoulthart.com (retrieved [[06 June]] [[2006]])</ref> Contrary to popular opinion, Gibbons contends that Rorschach's subtle body language and not his [[Rorschach inkblot test|Rorschach test]]-inspired mask are the real indications of his mood.<ref>Ibid.</ref> In addition, John Higgins' colouring technique was to rely upon primary colors, again indicative of the Golden Age style, rather than a wider colour selection.<ref name="BBC Book Review"> [http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A2594838 "BBC Book Review, May 2004, 'Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil'"] <U+2014> Watchmen reviewed by DJ Bu & The Astrons (retrieved [[02 June]] [[2006]])</ref> 

Gibbons, who had no formal art training, notes among his inspirations [[Norman Rockwell]], who was sometimes described as an illustrator with an idealized portraiture style, and [[Jack Kirby]] among many others.<ref name="Gibbons seq. interview"> [http://www.sequentialtart.com/archive/july99/gibbons.shtml "Sequential Tart, Volume II, Issue 7, July 1999, 'Under the Hood, Dave Gibbons'"] <U+2014> Interview with Dave Gibbons by Christy Kallies (retrieved [[02 June]] [[2006]])</ref> The art, while deriving inspiration from various predecessors, including [[Will Eisner]] and [[Wally Wood]] (both artists Gibbons also names as major influences), is at once original in its execution and can be seen as a precursor to later 'realistic' comic book artists such as [[Alex Ross]].

==Themes==
Realism is a primary mode in ''Watchmen'', which features themes that relate superheroes to the [[human condition]]. Moore explores the fantastic world of costumed adventurers by raising various social issues that begin with the perception of [[authority]].  The novel's examination of trust in authority can be summed up in the phrase, "Who watches the Watchmen?" In a [[Max Weber|Weberian]] sense, authority is seldom endorsed morally by those who do not have it, with institutionalised authority being unchallenged simply due to intrinsic aspects of [[Power (sociology)|social power]]. The vigilantes in ''Watchmen'', before the Keene Act, represent superheroes as an institution, generally unquestioned until the issues of responsibility and [[culpability]] are raised. This questioning of authority mirrors the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]], both of which are discussed in ''Watchmen''.

These ideas are also apparent in what post-modernist Gregory J. Golda calls the "anti-veneration" throughout the novel, illustrated by depicting superheroes as "cranky and inept old timers" and that "Anti-veneration... treats destructive societal norms as the direct responsibility of the viewer by attacking the principles society holds most dear. This lack of respect for the past is the crux of the ''Watchmen''."<ref name="Golda">{{cite web

}}</ref></div> 

The subject of anti-veneration explores superheroes who are treated as veritable gods to be worshipped at one point (with Dr. Manhattan taking on the literal manifestation of a [[deity]]) and then are deconstructed in order to reveal flaws, which makes them less worthy of [[hero]] worship, in the eyes of the public. Nonetheless, heroes can still be worthy within the ''valetism'' form of hero worship as theorised by classical sociologist [[Thomas Carlyle]] and expressed in ''Watchmen''.<ref name="Carlyle">{{cite web

[[Apocalypticism]] and [[conspiracy theory]] are elements of both plot and mood in the series.  The threat of nuclear annihilation is ever-present throughout the novel.

}}</ref> The plot is based around a conspiracy. Rorschach is obsessed with conspiracy theories, and appears to derive much of his thinking from the ''New Frontiersman''. Aronofsky argues that ''Watchmen'''s treatment of the subject was pioneering, but has since "become so <U+2018>pop<U+2019>, because of ''[[JFK]]'' and ''[[The X-Files]]'', it<U+2019>s entered pop culture consciousness, and Rorschach<U+2019>s vision is not that wacky any more."<ref name="Hughes">{{cite web

Conspiracy theories invoke a lack of control on the part of characters like Rorschach and lead to the examination of other themes in ''Watchmen'', such as [[determinism]]. Gregory J. Golda describes the relationship between the philosophy of determinism and Dr. Manhattan who "lives his now immortal life with a perception of time and events as unchangeable. He becomes the symbol of Determinism, " and that, "He lives his own life under this illusion of determinism failing to see that there was a superior intellect that could outsmart even an "all knowing" being."<ref name="Golda">{{cite web

}}</ref></div> This ties into notions of [[free will]] as discussed by [[Thomas Hobbes]], a prominent philosopher of determinism and human nature. Hobbesian views tended to support the notion that there was no absolute free will as Hobbes, "was a determinist in the sense that [he espoused that] although one's actions are free, one's will is not." <ref name="Thomas Hobbes"> [http://www.island-of-freedom.com/HOBBES.HTM Thomas Hobbes: 1588-1679, Quotations] <U+2014> Island of Freedom (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref> It is often Dr. Manhattan who discusses issues of determinism and free will as when he explains to Silk Spectre II: "We're all puppets, Laurie. I'm just a puppet who can see the '''strings'''." <ref name="Watchmen Chapter 9"> - '''Watchmen''' chapter 9, page 5, panel 4 (ISBN 0930289234)</ref>

''Watchmen'' also explores issues dealing with [[memory]] by utilizing flashbacks, which define the characters and how they are remembered by their peers.<ref name="Four Color">[http://www.staticred.net/four-colour/archives/002274.html  "Four Color Commentary"] <U+2014> ''Watchmen'' (retrieved [[05 June]] [[2006]])</ref> For example, the past actions of the Comedian are all selectively recalled by Dr. Manhattan, Ozymandias, and Nite Owl II as each recalls some significant event that defined who the Comedian was to them and how he influenced them. Further flashbacks by Dr. Manhattan, and the first and second Silk Spectres also relate to the power of memories as they serve to provide epiphanies or an idealised, "past, even [with] the grimy parts of it, well, it just keeps on getting brighter all the time," as the retired first Silk Spectre  explains to her daughter.<ref name="Watchmen Chapter 2"> - '''Watchmen''' chapter 2, page 4, panels 5-6 (ISBN 0930289234)</ref> It is Rorschach though, who constructs the most idyllic past with a father he never knew and a strong reverence for [[President Truman]].<ref name="Capn Wacky">[http://www.capnwacky.com/rj/watchmen/chapter1.html  "The Annotated Watchmen: Your complete guide to the classic series"] <U+2014> Chapter 1: "At Midnight, All the Agents...", p. 1, panel 4. (retrieved [[05 June]] [[2006]])</ref> 

[[Megalomania]] is also addressed in ''Watchmen'', but not with conventional "villains". Instead, Ozymandias is presented as an idealist who looks to the past for inspiration so that he may better utilise his prodigious intellect to help mankind. At first idolising [[Alexander the Great]], he later relates himself to [[Ramses II]] (and adopts his Greek name ''[[Ozymandias]]'') and the golden age of the [[Ancient Egypt|Pharaohs]].<ref name="Ozymandias">[http://www.celinus.com/index.php?cat=3  "Watchmen by Alan Moore"] <U+2014> Celinus (retrieved [[05 June]] [[2006]])</ref> This has parallels with the Golden Age superhero [[Hawkman]], who believed himself to be the reincarnation of an Egyptian prince as well. Ozymandias exhibits various aspects of [[Narcissistic personality disorder]] including behavioural grandiosity and a lack of [[empathy]].<ref name="Megalomania">[http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/narcissisticpd.htm  "Narcissistic Personality Disorder"] <U+2014> Behavenet Clinical Capsule (retrieved [[05 June]] [[2006]])</ref> 

Many of the themes in ''Watchmen'' are explored in Moore's other works including ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', which also dealt with issues relating to fascism and hero worship. In addition, the [[Nietzsche]]an ''[[<U+00DC>bermensch]]'' (literally "overman" or superman) archetype is personified throughout much of Moore's work, including Ozymandias in ''Watchmen'' and other characters Moore has created including [[Miracleman]] and [[Tom Strong]].

==Significance==
===Reception and criticism===
''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' placed ''Watchmen'' on its list of the 100 Greatest Novels from 1923 to Present, stating that it was "told with ruthless psychological realism, in fugal, overlapping plotlines and gorgeous, cinematic panels rich with repeating motifs...a heart-pounding, heartbreaking read and a watershed in the evolution of a young medium." ''Watchmen'' was the only [[graphic novel]] to be listed.<ref name="Time Magazine" /> ''Watchmen'' has also received several awards spanning different categories and genres including: [[Kirby Award]]s for ''Best Finite Series'', ''Best New Series'', ''Best Writer'', and ''Best Writer/Artist'', [[Eisner Award]]s for ''Best Finite Series'', ''Best Graphic Album'', ''Best Writer'', and ''Best Writer/Artist'', and a [[Hugo Award]] for ''Special Achievement''. 

''Watchmen'' received praise from those working within the [[comic book]] industry, as well as external reviewers, for its [[avant-garde]] portrayal of the traditional [[superhero]]. ''Watchmen'' became known as a novel which allowed the comic book to be recognised as "great art," rather than a [[low brow]] or unsophisticated [[genre]].<ref name="PopImage">[http://www.popimage.com/industrial/090600eddies.html "PopImage"] - retrieved ([[22 April]] [[2006]])</ref> Don Markstein of ''Toonopedia'' wrote that, "What ''[[The Maltese Falcon]]'' did for [[detective stories]] and ''[[Shane]]'' did for [[Westerns]], ''Watchmen'' did for [[superhero|superheroes]]. It transcended its origins in what was previously considered a [[low culture|low brow]] form of [[fiction]]." <ref name="toonopedia">[http://www.toonopedia.com/watchmen.htm "Don Markstein's Toonopedia: Watchmen"] <U+2014> Markstein's Comments on Toonopedia.com - (retrieved [[12 March]] [[2006]])</ref>

''Watchmen'''s status as a seminal book in the comic book field was recently boosted when acclaimed comic book author [[Stan Lee]] called it his, "all-time favorite comic book outside of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]."<ref name="Revolution SF"> [http://www.revolutionsf.com/article.html?id=178 "RevolutionSF: Watchmen] <U+2014> A review of ''Watchmen'' (retrieved [[14 April]] [[2006]])</ref> A review by ''"Revolution SF"'' goes on to say that ''Watchmen'' is "one of the most important stories in comic book history..."<ref name="Revolution SF" />

There has also been some criticism of ''Watchmen''. In terms of the artwork, the colours have been characterized as "flat" and too "contrasting" by one reviewer.<ref name="Bob's Comic Reviews"> [http://www.zompist.com/bob30.html "Bob's Comic Reviews"]</ref> There has been some questioning of the complexity of ''Watchmen'', as well as Gibbons' involvement in it, saying that he "always felt a bit like the fill-in guy."  The same source criticizes the long-term influence of the work, and Alan Moore generally, and asks "did the comic book have to 'grow up'?"<ref name="Slate">{{cite web

===References in other works===
''Watchmen'' was parodied by [[The Simpsons]]'s comic book series ''[[Radioactive Man (The Simpsons)|Radioactive Man]]'' in issue #679 "Who Washes The Washmen's Infinite Secrets Of Legendary Crossover Knight Wars?" (September 1994). 

[[Nite Owl]] and his ship make a cameo appearance in the third issue of ''[[Marvels]]'' by [[Kurt Busiek]] and [[Alex Ross]]. ''Under the Hood'', the book written by original Nite Owl,  Hollis Mason, is seen in a shop window and Rorschach is visible in the background of the superhero bar in ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'', also illustrated by Alex Ross.

In issue 17 of the late-eighties [[DC Comics|DC]] series ''[[Question (comics)|The Question]]'', by [[Dennis O'Neil]] and [[Denys Cowan]], the Question reads a ''Watchmen'' trade paperback and then contemplates Rorschach's crimefighting ideas and their relationship to his own, finally concluding that "Rorschach sucks" after attempting to employ his methods. This was an intentional irony, as Rorschach's character is partly based on the original Charlton Comics' version of The Question.

In 2004, the movie ''[[The Incredibles]]'' was released, with reviewers commenting upon themes expressed in the film which seemed to pay [[homage]] to ''Watchmen''.<ref>[http://www.scifimoviepage.com/dvd/incredibles-dvd.html "The Incredibles"] - retrieved ([[22 April]] [[2006]])</ref><ref name="Film Rotation">[http://www.filmrot.com/articles/news/005839.php "Film Rotation - Update: Watchmen"] - retrieved [[22 April]] [[2006]]</ref>

The now-defunct Canadian rock band [[The Watchmen]] took their name from the comic series; [[Joey Serlin]], their guitarist, is an avowed comics fan.

==Merchandising and adaptations==
:''See also: [[Watchmen (film)]]''
In 1987, [[Mayfair Games]] produced two adventure modules based on ''Watchmen'' for its ''[[DC Heroes]]'' [[role-playing game]]. These modules, entitled "Who Watches the Watchmen?" and "Taking out the Trash", included background information about the fictional ''Watchmen'' universe, approved by [[Alan Moore]]. His approval made these publications valuable to fans as the only outside source of supplemental information about the characters in the story (especially minor characters, such as the Minutemen and [[Moloch (comics)|Moloch]]).<ref name="Mayfair">[http://www.capnwacky.com/rj/watchmen/noncomic.html "The Annotated Watchmen"] - information regarding [[Mayfair Games]]' release of '''Watchmen'''' related material.</ref>

[[DC Comics]] also released a limited edition badge set featuring characters and images from the series, including a replica of the blood-stained smiley face badge worn by The Comedian that was featured so prominently in the story.  It is claimed that this badge set caused friction between Moore and DC Comics <U+2014> DC claimed that they were a "promotional item" and not merchandising, and therefore the company did not have to pay Moore or Gibbons royalties on the sets. <ref name=Merchandise">[http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/003869.html "PeterDavid.net"] - a personal [[blog]] entry where fans discuss [[Alan Moore]]</ref> Although neither party has stated the exact reason for the withdrawal of the figures, DC Comics did say in a press release that they would not go forward without the author's approval.<ref name="DC Statement">[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0008/25/ "Comics Continuum"] [[DC Comics]] statement regarding [[Alan Moore]]'s refusal to be involved with their proposed line of [[action figures]] - (retrieved [[15 April]] [[2006]]). </ref></div>

A film adaptation has been attempted several times, with none reaching even the casting phase. While Moore believes that [[David Hayter]]'s screenplay is "as close as I could imagine anyone getting to Watchmen" he did not intend to see it, had it been made.<ref name="EW article">[http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,1120854_1_0_,00.html "Watchmen: An Oral History"] - Provides commentary from Moore, Gibbons and others regarding the comic and [[Watchmen (film)|film]] (retrieved [[May 28]], [[2006]])</ref> [[Alan Moore]] "refuses to have his name attached to any...films." <ref name="Alan Moore - Films"> [http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA604654.html?pubdate=5%2F30%2F2005&display=archive "Moore Leaves DC for Top Shelf"] - An article speaking of [[Alan Moore]]'s decision to leave [[DC Comics]] (retrieved [[15 April]] [[2006]]) </ref>  Currently, [[Zack Snyder]] is attached to direct a script written by Alex Tse for [[Warner Brothers]] studio.<ref name="Reuters report"> [http://today.reuters.com/news/NewsArticle.aspx?type=filmNews&storyID=2006-06-23T072459Z_01_N23183191_RTRIDST_0_FILM-WATCHMEN-DC.XML "Zack Snyder attached to direct Watchmen"]</ref>

On 23rd June 2006 it was confirmed by [[Warner Bros. Studios]] that [[Zack Snyder]] would direct the big screen adaptation of Watchmen.

==Editions==
Originally published as twelve individual issues, ''Watchmen'' was later reprinted as a graphic novel (ISBN 0930289234). A special hardcover edition was produced by Graphitti Designs in 1987, containing 48 pages of bonus material, including the original proposal and concept art.  On [[5 October]] [[2005]], DC released ''Absolute Watchmen'' (ISBN 1401207138), a hardcover edition of ''Watchmen'' in the [[DC Comics Absolute Editions|Absolute Edition]] series to celebrate its upcoming 20th anniversary. The book features a slipcase as well as restored and recoloured art by John Higgins at [[Wildstorm FX]], under the direction of Dave Gibbons. The new book also includes the bonus material from the Graphitti edition, marking the first time this material has been widely available.
