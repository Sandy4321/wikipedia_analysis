{{Politics of Vatican City}}
[[File:Flag of the Vatican City.svg|left|thumb|100px|Vatican City flag]]

The '''politics of Vatican City''' take place in a framework of an [[absolute monarchy|absolute]] [[theocracy|theocratic]] [[elective monarchy]], in which the head of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]], the [[Pope]], exercises [[ex officio]] supreme legislative, executive, and judicial power over the [[State of the Vatican City]]<ref>[[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]], Art. 1, #1</ref> (an entity distinct from the [[Holy See]]), a rare case of non-hereditary [[monarchy]].

The pope is elected in the [[papal election|Conclave]], composed of all the [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal elector]]s (now limited to all the cardinals below the age of 80), [[sede vacante|after the death]] or [[papal resignation|resignation]] of the previous Pope. The Conclave is held in the [[Sistine Chapel]], where all the electors are locked in (Latin ''cum clave'') until the election for which a two-thirds majority is required. The faithful can follow the results of the polls (usually two in the morning and two in the evening, until election) by a chimney-top, visible from [[St. Peter's Square]]: in a stove attached to the chimney are burnt the voting papers, and additives make the resulting smoke black (''fumata nera'') in case of no election, white (''fumata bianca'') when the new pope is finally elected. The [[Dean of the College of Cardinals|Dean of the Sacred College]] (''Cardinale Decano'') will then ask the freshly elected pope to choose his pastoral name, and as soon as the pope is dressed with the white habit, the [[Cardinal protodeacon#Catholic Church|Senior Cardinal-Deacon]] (''Cardinale Protodiacono'') appears on the major balcony of St. Peter's fa<U+00E7>ade to introduce the new pope<ref>Ap. Const. Universi Dominici Gregis n. 89</ref> with the famous [[Latin]] sentence
''Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum: [[habemus papam]].''(I announce to you a great joy: We have a Pope).

The term "Holy See" refers to the composite of the authority, jurisdiction, and sovereignty vested in the Pope and his advisers to direct the worldwide [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It is therefore quite distinct from the Vatican City state, which was created in 1929, through the [[Lateran treaties]] between the Holy See and [[Italy]]. As the "central government" of the Roman Catholic Church, the Holy See has a legal personality that allows it to enter into treaties as the juridical equal of a state and to send and receive diplomatic representatives. It has formal diplomatic relations with 179 nations.<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/article-34102?l=english ZENIT news agency, "179 states have full diplomatic relations with the Holy See"]</ref> The State of Vatican City, for its part, is recognized under international law as a sovereign territory. Unlike the Holy See, it does not receive or send diplomatic representatives, and the Holy See acts on its behalf in international affairs.

==Administration of Vatican City==
As with almost all monarchies, the executive, legislative and judicial power of government reside in the crown, in this case in the office of the [[Bishop of Rome]] (the pope). However, as with many monarchies, the pope exercises this power through other organs which act on his behalf and in his name.

The [[pope]] commonly delegates the internal administration of [[Vatican City]] to various bodies and officials. However, according to the [[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State#Article One|Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]], "The [[Supreme Pontiff]], [[Sovereign]] of [[Vatican City State]], has the fullness of legislative, executive, and judicial powers"<ref>[[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]], Art. 1, <U+00A7> 1</ref> for [[Vatican City]].

The pope delegates [[legislative]] authority for the state to the [[unicameral]] [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]]. This commission was established in 1939 by [[Pope Pius XII]]. It consists of seven [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]s appointed by the pope for five-year terms. Laws passed by the Commission must be approved by the pope through the [[Secretariat of State (Vatican)|Secretariat of State]] prior to being published and taking effect.

The President of the Pontifical Commission is also the [[President of the Governorate of Vatican City]], to whom the pope delegates executive authority for the state. The president is assisted by a Secretary General and a Vice Secretary General. Each of these officers is appointed by the pope for a five-year term. Actions of the President must be approved by the Commission. Various departments and offices report to the Governorate, handling such issues as communications, internal security, fire protection, and the [[Vatican Museums]]. The [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|Corpo della Gendarmeria]] is the state's security and police force, not the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard]], which is an organ of the Holy See, not Vatican City.

The Pope is ''[[ex officio]]'' [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] of the Vatican City State. He delegates executive authority to the [[President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], who is ''ex officio'' President of the Governorate. The president is appointed by the Pope for a five-year term, but may be removed at any time by the pope. The president reports all important matters to the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], the Pope's chief everyday advisory body, which is consulted on all matters, even if they belong to the specific competence of the Commission for Vatican City State or, for instance, that of the [[Congregation for Catholic Education]]. The Secretariat of State is not thereby considered to hold responsibility for such matters, and the Cardinal Secretary of State is not seen as heading the Vatican City State or the various departments of the [[Roman Curia]], other than the Secretariat of State itself.

Vatican City is a member of [[CEPT]], [[Eutelsat]], [http://www.igc.org.uk/ International Grains Council], [[Intelsat]], [[ITU]] and [[UPU]].

Vatican City does not have direct diplomatic relations with other states. Its foreign relations are managed by the [[Holy See]]. See [[Holy See#Relationship with the Vatican City and other territories]].

==Legislature==
A unicameral [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], appointed by the [[Pope]], operates as legislative branch, proposing [[law]] and policy to the [[Pope]].<ref>[[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]], Art. 3 <U+00A7>1</ref> Prior to taking effect, [[law]]s and policies passed by the commission must be approved by the [[Supreme Pontiff]], through the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]],<ref>[[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]], Art. 4 <U+00A7>3</ref> and be published in the Italian-language supplement of the ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'' that deals with [[Vatican City State]] matters.

The "Councillors of the State" give their consultation in the drafting of legislation.<ref>[[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]], Art. 13 <U+00A7>1</ref> They may be consulted either alone or collegially.<ref>[[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]], Art. 13 <U+00A7>2</ref>

==Judiciary==
{{Main|Law of Vatican City}}
Vatican City has a legal system distinct from that of [[Italy]]. The [[pope]]'s judicial authority is exercised through the Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the [[Apostolic Signatura]], as he by law serves also as the President of the Cassation Court of Vatican City (i.e. the highest court of appeal)<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]] (AAS) 79|publisher=[[Holy See]]|chapter=Legge che approva l'ordinamento giudiziario dello Stato della Citt<U+00E0> del Vaticano (Suppl. 12)|year=1987 |chapter-url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS%2079%20%5B1987%5D%20-%20ocr.pdf |page=45<U+2013>}}</ref>

The population of the state is a few hundred. Each day outsiders come there to work. 18 million people visit there each year. 

In one year its courts tried 640 civil cases and 226 penal cases.<ref>[http://www.catholic.net/index.php?option=dedestaca&id=7343&grupo=&canal= Alessandro Speciale, "The Vatican Tribunal as a model of efficiency" in ''Catholic.net'']</ref>

The penal cases are usually for minor crimes such as [[pickpocketing]].<ref name="CNNNadeau">Nadeau, Barbie.

Under the terms of article 22 the [[Lateran Treaty]],<ref name="treaty1">{{cite web|title=INTER SANCTAM SEDEM ET ITALIAE REGNUM  CONVENTIONES*  INITAE DIE 11 FEBRUARII 1929|language=Italian|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html|publisher=Vatican.va|accessdate=12 July 2013}}</ref> Italy will, at the request of the Holy See, punish individuals for crimes committed within Vatican City and will itself proceed against the person who committed the offence, if that person takes refuge in Italian territory.

Vatican City has no prison system, apart from a few detention cells for pre-trial detention.<ref>[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/05/paolo_gabriele_case_how_does_the_vatican_deal_with_criminals_.html How Does Vatican City Deal With Criminals?] ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. 30 May 2012.
