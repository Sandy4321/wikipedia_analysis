"'''R U Professional'''" is a [[satire|satirical]] song by the [[indie rock]] band [[The Mae Shi]], inspired by the audio of a July 2008 outburst by actor [[Christian Bale]] on the set of ''[[Terminator Salvation]]''. Bale was immersed in a scene filming for the movie with actress [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], when he yelled at [[Cinematographer|director of photography]], [[Shane Hurlbut]], for walking into his line of sight. Hurlbut responded calmly and apologized several times to Bale, and continued shooting for seven hours after the incident. An audio recording of the incident appeared on the website [[TMZ.com]] on February 2, 2009. A few days after the audio appeared online, Bale commented to Los Angeles radio station [[KROQ-FM]] that he had acted inappropriately on set and was able to move past the issue after speaking about it with Hurlbut. Bale praised the [[cinematography]] work by Hurlbut on the film.

The Mae Shi wrote and released the song twenty-four hours after the appearance of the Bale audio on the Internet. The group emphasized in a statement that the piece was an homage created in order to honor Bale. They composed and recorded the song later in the evening the same day Bale's tirade appeared on the Internet. "R U Professional" [[parody|parodies]] Bale by making use of [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] of his voice from the 2008 diatribe. The chorus incorporates Bale's use of the word "professional" from his outburst. The song's lyrics reference several films the actor starred in, including: ''[[Newsies]]'', ''[[Swing Kids (film)|Swing Kids]]'', ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]'', and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''. 

The piece was made available on [[YouTube]] and via download on [[MediaFire]] on February 3, 2009. "R U Professional" received generally positive reception. ''[[MTV.com]]'' compared its style to the group [[Devo]] and [[new wave music]]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described it as a lively [[pop music]] tribute to the actor. ''[[USA Today]]'' called the song fun dance music and creatively motivated. ''[[The Toronto Sun]]'' praised its creative lyrics and use of audio from the Bale oration. ''[[El Pa<U+00ED>s]]'' described the piece as an electropop song that contributed to the viral spread of the Bale rant online. ''[[Dose (magazine)|Dose]]'' characterized it as an [[Electro (music)|electro]] [[jam session]]. Publications including the ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' and [[Pitchfork Media]] were impressed with the group's ability to compose and release the song twenty-four hours after the audio of the Bale outburst appeared online. The ''[[Irish Independent]]'' wrote that they thought the group may have used a [[melody]] they already had and adapted it for the song in order to release it so quickly.
