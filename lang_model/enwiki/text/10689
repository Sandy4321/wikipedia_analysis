'''Lawrence Julius Taylor''' (born [[February 4]], [[1959]]), nicknamed '''L.T.''', is a retired [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] [[American football]] player. Taylor played his entire professional career as a [[linebacker]] for the [[New York Giants]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He is often considered to be one of the greatest defensive players in the history of football, and has been called the greatest defensive player of all time by media members, former players, and coaches. 

After an [[All-America]]n career at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] (UNC), Taylor was drafted by the Giants with the second overall selection in the [[1981 NFL Draft]]. Although controversy surrounded the selection due to Taylor's contract demands, the two sides quickly resolved their issues and Taylor won several defensive awards after his rookie season. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Taylor was a disruptive force at [[outside linebacker]], and is widely considered to have changed the [[pass rush]]ing schemes, [[offensive line]] play, and [[offensive formations]] used in the NFL. Taylor produced double-digit [[Quarterback sack|sacks]] seasons consecutively from 1984 through 1990, including a career high of 20.5 in 1986. He also won a record three [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year|Defensive Player of the Year]] awards and was named the league's [[NFL MVP|Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) for his performance in the 1986 season. He was named first-team All-Pro in each of his first nine seasons and was a key member of the Giants' defense, nicknamed "The Big Blue Wrecking Crew", that led New York to [[Super Bowl XXI]] and [[Super Bowl XXV|XXV]] victories. During the 1980s Taylor and fellow linebackers [[Carl Banks]] and Hall of Famer [[Harry Carson]] gave the Giants linebacking corps a reputation as one of the best in the NFL.  

During his career as a player and after his retirement, Taylor often lived a controversial lifestyle. He admitted to using addictive drugs such as [[cocaine]] as early as his second year in the NFL, and was suspended several times by the league after failing drug tests. His drug abuse escalated after his retirement, and he was jailed three times for attempted drug possession. However, in recent years Taylor has cleaned up his lifestyle and lived a sober, drug-free life since 1998. He worked as a [[color commentator]] on sporting events for several years after his retirement and is currently pursuing a career as an actor.

== Early life==
Lawrence Taylor was the middle of three sons born to Clarence and Iris Taylor in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]].

"He was reckless, just reckless."<ref name="espn"/> UNC later retired Taylor's jersey and after his career at UNC ended it became common for subsequent players to frequently be measured against Taylor. When [[Julius Peppers]], a fellow alumnus and current member of the NFL's [[Carolina Panthers]], attended UNC he was frequently compared to Taylor.

==NFL career==
===1981 NFL Draft and training camp===
In the [[1981 NFL Draft]], Taylor was [[NFL Draft|drafted]] by the NFL's New York Giants as the # 2 pick overall. In a poll of NFL [[General Manager]]s (GMs) taken before the draft 26 out of the 28 GMs stated that if they had the first selection they would select Taylor.<ref name="Bob">Sansevere, Bob. [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5505815_ITM Giants' L.T.: His mean streaks revolutionized NFL, made him the best.], Knight Ridder, [[January 8]], [[1994]], available at [[AccessMyLibrary|accessmylibrary.com]], accessed [[February 17]], [[2007]]. </ref> One of the only two GMs who stated that they would not take Taylor was the GM of the [[New Orleans Saints]], who had the first pick in the draft.<ref name="Bob"/> Giants General Manager [[George Young (NFL)|George Young]] was one of the many who saw Taylor's potential and even predicted before the draft that he would be better than NFL legends such as [[Dick Butkus]]: "Taylor is the best college linebacker I've ever seen. Sure, I saw Dick Butkus play. There's no doubt in my mind about Taylor. He's bigger and stronger than Butkus was. On the [[blitz (American football)|blitz]], he's devastating."<ref name="Bob"/> Shortly before the draft controversy arose however, as Taylor and his agent Mike Trope expressed a desire to sign a contract for a then unheard of rookie salary of $250,000 [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] per season.<ref name="walkout">[[Associated Press]].

Despite the controversy, and to the raucous approval of the crowd in attendance at the draft (which was held in New York), the Giants selected Taylor.<ref name="DA">[[Dave Anderson (sportswriter)|Anderson, Dave]].

"He was the cleanest player in the draft. By that I mean there was no rap on him,"<ref name="yellowflag">Anderson, Dave.

===Early career: 1981-1985===
Taylor's NFL regular season debut occurred on [[September 6]], [[1981]] in a 24<U+2013>10 loss to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. The game was relatively non-noteworthy for Taylor except for his picking up a [[American football#Penalties|penalty]] for a late hit on Eagles running back Perry Harrington.<ref name="yellowflag"> </ref> Taylor went on to finish his rookie season with 9.5 sacks,<ref name="hof">[http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=212 Lawrence Taylor bio], profootballhof.com, accessed [[February 2]], [[2007]]. </ref> and is often considered to have had one of the greatest rookie seasons in NFL history.<ref name="ROY">Merron, Jeff.

Walsh assigned [[offensive guard|guard]] [[John Ayers]], the team's best blocker, to block Taylor and although Taylor still recorded a sack and three tackles he was not as effective as normal.<ref name="Johnson">Johnson, Roy S.

Taylor's second year was cut short by the [[National Football League Players Association#1982 NFL strike|1982 NFL strike]] and the Giants struggled to a 4<U+2013>5 finish in the abbreviated season.<ref>[http://www.databasefootball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=NYG&lg=nfl&yr=1982 1982 New York Giants], databasefootball.com, accessed [[February 17]], [[2007]]. </ref> The season included one of the more memorable plays of Taylor's career however. In the nationally televised Thanksgiving day game against the [[Detroit Lions]] the teams were tied 6<U+2013>6 early in the fourth quarter, when the Lions drove deep into New York territory. Lions quarterback [[Gary Danielson]] dropped back to pass and threw the ball out to his left toward the sidelines.<ref name="Simms">[http://www.nfl.com/news/story/9059331 Last word on Young's comments], NFL.com, accessed [[February 17]], [[2007]] </ref> Taylor ran in front of the intended receiver and intercepted the ball.

Shortly after the 1982 season Perkins resigned as head coach to take over the same position at the [[University of Alabama]] and [[Bill Parcells]] was hired from within to replace him. Parcells had been the team's defensive coordinator, and in the coming years this change would prove crucial to the Giants and Taylor. Leading up to the [[1983 NFL season|1983 season]], Taylor engaged in a training camp holdout that lasted three weeks and ended with Taylor coming back to the team under his old contract with three games remaining in the preseason.<ref>Janofsky, Michael. [http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F60B1FF6345D0C708DDDA10894DB484D81 Taylor ends holdout], ''The New York Times'', [[August 13]], [[1983]], accessed [[February 17]], [[2007]]. </ref> 

Although Taylor recorded 9 sacks and made the All-Pro team for the third consecutive season in 1983,<ref name="hof"/> the Giants struggled. The team finished 3<U+2013>12<U+2013>1,<ref name="1983NYG">[http://www.databasefootball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=NYG&yr=1983&lg=nfl 1983 New York Giants], databasefootball.com, accessed [[February 20]], [[2007]]. </ref> and Parcells received heavy criticism during the season from the fans and media. Following the season, Taylor was involved in a fight for his services between the [[New Jersey Generals]] of the [[USFL]] and the Giants.<ref name="eske">Eskenazi, Gerald.

The Giants, who were eager to keep Taylor, took part in attempting to free Taylor from it. The results of this tussle included many considerations but the ultimate result was threefold: 1) Taylor had to return the $1 million dollars to Trump, 2) the Giants were required to pay Trump $750,000 dollars over the next five seasons in order for Trump to release Taylor's rights, and 3) Taylor was given a new 6-year $6.2-million-dollar contract by the Giants.<ref name="eske"/><ref>Eskenazi, Gerald. pg. 46. <U+2014> Trump later stated that in the event of the USFL folding (which occurred in 1985), he would have held on to Taylor's rights to employment: "I'd put him in a doorman's uniform and have him work at one of my buildings." (ibid) </ref>

The Giants record rebounded to 9<U+2013>7 in 1984,<ref name="1984NYG">[http://www.databasefootball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=NYG&lg=nfl&yr=1984 1984 New York Giants], databasefootball.com, accessed [[February 20]], [[2007]]. </ref> and Taylor had another All-Pro season.<ref name="hof"/> Taylor got off to an exceptional start to the season including four sacks in a September game against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], and 8 total sacks in the Giants first four games.<ref name="Superman">Anderson, Dave.

In contrast to the previous season the Giants headed into the [[1985 NFL season|1985 season]] with a sense of optimism after their successful 1984 campaign and a 5<U+2013>0 pre-season record in 1985.<ref name="5-0">Litsky, Frank.

On a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game against the Redskins, Taylor's sack of Redskins quarterback [[Joe Theismann]] inadvertently resulted in a compound fracture of Theismann's right leg. Immediately after the sack, a distraught Taylor frantically screamed for [[paramedics]] to attend to Theismann. Although this sack by Taylor ended Theismann's career, Theismann has never blamed Taylor for the injury. Taylor claims he has never seen the video clip of the play and says he never wants to.<ref>[http://www.hd.net/transcript.html?air_master_id=A4291 Face 2 Face with Roy Firestone], [[HDNet|hd.net]], accessed [[February 24]], [[2007]]. </ref>

===Mid-career and championships: 1986-90===

In 1986 Taylor had one of the most successful seasons by a defensive player in the history of the NFL.

With the Super Bowl win, Taylor had just capped off an unprecedented start to his career. Six years into his career Taylor had won the [[NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Award]] (1981), the [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award]] a record three times (1981, 1982, 1986), been named to the AP All-Pro first team six times (1981<U+2013>86),<ref name="hof"/> became the first defensive player in NFL history to be unanimously voted the league's MVP (1986), and led his team to a championship (1986).

The Giants appeared to have a bright future coming off their 1986 championship season as they were one of the younger teams in the league.

The Giants looked to rebound to their championship ways in 1988 but the start of the season was marred by controversy surrounding Taylor. Taylor tested positive for cocaine and was suspended by the league for thirty days, as it was his second violation of the NFL's substance abuse policy. The first result had been kept private and was not known to the public at the time. He was kept away from the press during this period and checked himself into rehab in early September.<ref name="coke">Harvin, Al.

Following the 1990 season Parcells, whom Taylor had become very close to,<ref>Rosenberg, Sid.

It became the first season in his career that he did not make the [[Pro Bowl]], after setting a then record by making it his first ten years in the league. Taylor finished with 7 sacks in 14 games<ref name="dbf"/> and the Giants defense, while still respectable, was no longer one of the top units in the league.  

Taylor rebounded in the early stages of what many thought would be his final season in 1992.

Taylor returned for the [[1993 NFL season|1993 season]] enticed by the chance to play with a new coach (the newly hired [[Dan Reeves]]), and determined not end his career due to injury. The Giants experienced a resurgent season in 1993.

Taylor announced his retirement at the post-game press conference saying, "I think it's time for me to retire. I've done everything I can do. I've been to Super Bowls. I've been to playoffs.

Now you didn't do that very often in this league but I think he's one person that we learned the lesson the hard way. We lost ball games."<ref name="'L.T.'"/>  His skills at outside linebacker forced other coaches to retool their offensive schemes to manage his impact. In the late 70's and early 80's, a blitzing linebacker was almost always picked up by a running back. However, these players were usually no match for Taylor.<ref> Schwartz. pg. 142 </ref> The tactic employed by Bill Walsh in the 1982 playoffs, namely of employing an offensive guard to block Taylor, began to be copied around the league. This move, however, left a hole in the offensive protection that a middle linebacker could exploit. Later, Walsh and other coaches began using offensive left tackles to block Taylor. Although Taylor made adjustments to his game to remain dominant, it soon became common in the NFL for offensive linemen to pick up blitzing linebackers, such as Taylor. In addition to the changes in offensive schemes Taylor influenced, he also introduced new defensive techniques to the game such as chopping the ball out of the quarterback's hands rather than tackling him.<ref name="encarta"/>

==Drugs and extreme measures==
[[Image:Ltaylormug.jpg|thumb|150px|Taylor's mug shot from his 1996 arrest in [[South Carolina]] for attempted possession of crack cocaine.]]

::<U+2014>Taylor in 1987<ref>Taylor and Falkner. Pg.189 </ref>
In contrast to his success on the football field, Taylor's personal life has been marred by [[narcotic|drug]] usage and controversy. When Taylor was once asked what he could do that no outside linebacker could, his answer was, "Drink".<ref name="espn"/> However, alcohol abuse was not the largest of his substance abuse problems. After admitting to and testing positive for cocaine in 1987, he was suspended from football for 30 days in 1988 after failing a second drug test. After his second positive test he gave up drugs for five years as a third positive test would have ended his career.<ref name="cbs"/> However, as he approached retirement he looked forward to picking up the habit again, saying in his second autobiography "I saw coke as the only bright spot in my future."<ref>Taylor and Serby. pg. 161 </ref> After his retirement he began abusing drugs on a regular basis. He went through drug rehab twice in 1995, only to later be arrested twice over a three-year span for attempting to buy cocaine (from undercover officers).<ref>[http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016489.html Taylor ranked 40th-best athlete], espn.com, accessed [[May 3]], [[2007]]. </ref> During this period Taylor lived almost exclusively in his home with white sheets covering his windows and only associated with other drug users.<ref name="cbs"/> Taylor later stated, <U+201C>I had gotten really bad.

In a November 2003 interview with [[Mike Wallace (journalist)|Mike Wallace]] on the television [[newsmagazine]] ''[[60 Minutes]]'', Taylor claimed he hired and sent [[prostitution|prostitutes]] to opponents' hotel rooms the night before a game in an attempt to tire them out,<ref name="cbs"/> and that at his peak, he spent thousands of dollars a day on narcotics.<ref name="cbs"/> During the interview he also recounted several other instances of his hard-partying lifestyle during his years in the NFL, including an episode when he arrived to a team meeting in handcuffs after a night spent with some [[call girls]]. Taylor stated, "A couple of ladies that were trying out some new equipment they had. You know? And I just happened to, and they just didn't happen to have the key.<U+201D><ref name="cbs"/> He also recounted that to beat NFL drug tests he would submit the urine of his teammates.<ref name="cbs"/>

==After the NFL, and the recovery==
In Taylor's final year in the NFL (1993) he started a company called All-Pro Products. The company [[went public]] at $5 a share, and amazingly tripled in value during the first month of its existence. The stock price went up to $16.50 a share, at which point Taylor's stake had an estimated value of more than $10 million.<ref name="Norris">Norris, Floyd.

Taylor later commented that the situation made him more nervous than any play of his career, "I'm saying to myself (as the pass is being thrown), 'If I drop this pass, I got to run my black ass all the way back to Upper Saddle River because there ain't no way I'm going to be able to stay in that stadium'."<ref name="NFL"/> Taylor caught the pass, however, and the capacity crowd in attendance cheered in approval.<ref>George, Thomas.

T.], ''The New York Times'', [[September 5]], [[1995]], accessed [[April 22]], [[2007]]. </ref>

Taylor has recently been pursuing a career in acting, appearing in the [[Oliver Stone]] movie, ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'' where he played a character very much like himself. He also appeared as himself in both the [[HBO]] series ''[[The Sopranos]]'' and the film ''[[The Waterboy]]''. Taylor later appeared with [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Richard Roundtree]], [[Christian Bale]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], [[Vanessa Williams]], [[Toni Collette]] and [[Busta Rhymes]] in the [[Shaft (2000 film)|2000 version of ''Shaft'']]. Taylor also added his voice to the controversial [[video game]], ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'', playing the steroid-riddled, possibly insane former football player B.J. Smith, a character that poked fun at his fearsome, drug-fueled public image. He also added his voice to the controversial video game ''[[Blitz: The League]]'', which was partially based on his life in the NFL.<ref>Thomas, Vincent.

In 1999, when Taylor became eligible for the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]], there were some concerns that his hard-partying lifestyle and drug abuse would hurt his candidacy.<ref name="hall?">[http://media.cnnsi.com/football/nfl/news/1999/01/30/halloffame_voting/ LT gets the OK], sportsillustrated.cnn.com, [[January 30]], [[1999]], accessed [[May 3]], [[2007]]. </ref> These concerns proved to be ill-founded, however, as he was voted in on the first ballot. His son Lawrence Taylor Jr. gave his introduction speech at the induction ceremony.<ref name="induct">[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/news/1999/08/07/halloffame_ceremony_ap/ Five for the ages: Pro Football Hall of Fame inducts five more members], sportsillustrated.cnn.com, accessed [[February 17]], [[2007]]. </ref> Taylor's wife, his three children, and his parents were in attendance and during his induction speech Taylor acknowledged them saying, "[t]hank you for putting up with me for all those years."<ref name="induct"/> He also credited former Giants owner [[Wellington Mara]] for being supportive of him saying, "[h]e probably cared more about me as a person than he really should have."<ref name="induct"/>

In recent years, Taylor has cleaned up his life and lived a healthy, clean lifestyle since 1998.<ref name="Losing himself">Anderson, Dave. [http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F5081FFC3E5E0C7B8EDDA80994DB404482 PRO FOOTBALL; Losing Himself to Find Himself], ''The New York Times'', [[November 28]], [[2003]], accessed [[February 24]], [[2007]]. </ref> Taylor's soul-wrenching admission with Mike Wallace in 2003 reignited his popularity with the public. Taylor often speaks of his playing career, which he played with reckless abandon, and the drug-abusing stages of his life as the "L.T." periods of his life.<ref name="Losing himself"/> Taylor described "L.T." as an adrenaline junkie who lived life on a thrill ride.<ref name="Losing himself"/> Taylor commented in 2003 that "L. T. died a long time ago, and I don't miss him at all...all that's left is Lawrence Taylor."<ref name="Losing himself"/> In July 2006 Taylor again re-emerged into the public eye, appearing on the cover of a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' issue dedicated to former athletes and sport figures. In the magazine Taylor credited his hobby of [[golf]] with helping him get over his previous hard-partying ways and drug filled lifestyle.<ref>''Sports Illustrated''. Volume 105, issue 1. [[July 3]], [[2006]]. </ref>
