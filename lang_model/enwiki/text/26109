"'''Poker Face'''" is an [[electropop]] song by American [[dance-pop]] singer-songwriter [[Lady Gaga]] from her debut album, ''[[The Fame (album)|The Fame]]''. Produced by [[RedOne]], it was released as the album's second single in late 2008 in some markets and early 2009 in the rest of the world. The song is an uptempo dance song following the foot-steps of her previous single "[[Just Dance]]" but has a darker musical tone. The main idea behind the song is Gaga's personal experience with bisexuality while lyrically it is about sex and gambling and dedicated by Gaga to her friends who gamble. 

"Poker Face" has been well-received by the critics with most of them appreciating the robotic hook and the chorus. The song has attained worldwide success, topping the charts in more than seventeen countries including the USA, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and many other European countries. The music video portrays Gaga singing the song in various costumes and playing [[strip poker]] in a mansion. The song has been performed on a number of live appearances by Gaga including the [[American Idol Season 8|eighth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'' and her first headlining [[The Fame Ball Tour|Fame Ball tour]] where alternate variations of the track has been performed, including a [[Piano|piano version]] which she played while wearing a dress made of bubbles, and an [[electronica|electronic version]].

During her [[The Fame Ball Tour|Fame Ball tour]] performance at [[Palm Springs]] on Saturday 11th of April, Gaga explained to the crowd the true meaning behind the term "Poker Face" used in the song. She suggested that the song dealt about her personal experience with [[bisexuality]]. The idea behind the song was to be with a man but fantasizing about a woman, hence the man in the song needs to read her "Poker Face" to understand what is going through her mind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/entertainment/Lady_GaGa_Entertains_Thousands_At_Palm_Springs_White_Party.html|title=Lady GaGa Entertains Thousands At Palm Springs White Party|date=April 14, 2009|accessdate=2009-04-17|work=[[Access Hollywood]]|publisher=[[NBC]]}}</ref>

Lyrically, "Poker Face" is all about sexual innuendo and teasing.<ref name=about.com/> The [[Chorus (music)|chorus]] repeats two alternating lyrics. After the hook "Can't read my Poker Face" the backup singer says "He's got me like nobody" and then in the next line says "She's got me like nobody".

==Music video==
[[Image:PokerFaceVideo.jpg<U+200E>|160px|left|thumb|Lady Gaga emerges from the pool wearing a masquerade mask in the music video for "Poker Face".]]

The [[music video]] for "Poker Face" was directed by [[Ray Kay]] and was aided by [[Anthony Mandler]].<ref name=video>{{cite web|url=http://www.interscope.com/artist/player/default.aspx?mid=3156&aid=599|title=Video Premiere: Lady GaGa's 'Poker Face'|date=October 23, 2008|accessdate=2009-04-06|work=[[Interscope Records]]|publisher=www.interscoperecords.com}}</ref> Premiering on October 22, 2008, The video is set by a pool, as well as in a mansion. The video begins with Lady Gaga emerging out of the pool wearing a shiny masquerade mask and a black full body leotard, with two [[Great Danes]] beside her. She throws the mask aside and the song begins with a facial shot of Gaga singing it.<ref name=video/> Gaga wears a metallic sticker on her left cheek in this shot. Featured in the video are scenes of Gaga in a mansion and dancing poolside with her dancers in a turquoise leotard.<ref name=video/> Gaga attends a wild party where every man and woman tries their luck on a stripped poker game. The party gets wilder when all the party's guests strip down to their underwear, dance around, and share kisses with each other. The video also features two [[harlequin]] [[Great Danes]] and several white mannequins on her swimming pool deck who are supposedly playing her servants. During the musical interlude before the "I won't tell you that I love you" hook, Gaga is shown in her trademark "Pop Music Will Never Be Low Brow" sunglasses while sitting beside the pool. The video ends with the head shot of Gaga singing the Mum-mum-mum-ma hook. 

Gaga explained in the nineteenth episode of her "Transmision Gagavision" series, the main idea behind the music video of "Poker Face". She said that "I knew I wanted it to be sexy, so I thought no pants, because that's sexy, [...]And I knew I wanted it to be futuristic, so I thought shoulder pads, because that's my thing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interscope.com/artist/player/default.aspx?mid=4556&aid=599|title=Transmission Gagavision: Episode 19|date=December 13, 2008|work=[[Interscope Records]]|publisher=www.interscoperecords.com|accessdate=2009-04-17}}</ref> The music video premiered on [[MTV (UK)|MTV UK]] on February 17, 2009. In some versions of the song, the words "muffin" (being a slang term for the woman's [[vagina]]), "Russian Roulette," and "gun" are censored out (bleeped) by the mum-mum-mum-ma hook.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blueblood.net/2009/03/lady-gaga-poker-face/|title=Lady Gaga is Bluffin with her Muffin|last=G|first=Amelia|date=March 18, 2009|work=Blue Blood|publisher=www.blueblood.net|accessdate=2009-04-17}}</ref>

The song was performed by Gaga both in the original version and the acoustic piano version in her headlining [[The Fame Ball Tour|The Fame Ball]] tour. She performed the piano version wearing a dress made of plastic transparent bubbles and playing the glass piano with her stilletoes with a glowing mannequin, like the music video, standing in front of the stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://omg.yahoo.com/news/lady-gaga-wows-with-big-beats-bluesy-surprises/20032|title=Lady GaGa wows with big beats, bluesy surprises|author=Sheri Linden|date=March 15, 2009|accessdate=2009-03-17|work=Reuters|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]}}</ref>  On April 1, 2009, both the acoustic & normal version of "Poker Face" was performed live on Fox's [[American Idol]]. The performance started with Gaga sitting at a Plexiglass piano filled with bubbles and bathed in pink light. She started singing the first verse of "Poker Face" in a [[Bette Middler]] style accompanied by a violin player while wearing a shiny aluminum shoulder pad and platinum bleached blond wig. After the first chorus, the pace increased whence the original intro for the song started. Gaga got up from her seat and proceeded to perform the song in the middle of the stage. She wore a silvery leotard with a giant star on her shoulder and tassels. As the song progressed to the intermediate verse, the violist played a hoe-down version of the music and Gaga danced around frantically over the stage. The performance ended with Gaga staring towards the audience while revealing an open zipper patched over her left eye. This performance has been described an "alien-disco performance art".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1608347/20090402/lady_gaga.jhtml+lady+gaga+shows+her+flashiest&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=in|title=Lady Gaga Shows Her Flashiest 'Poker Face' On 'American Idol'|author=Gil Kaufman|date=April 2, 2009|accessdate=2009-04-06|work=[[MTV]]|publisher=MTV Networks Inc.}}</ref>
