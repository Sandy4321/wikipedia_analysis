'''US Highway 45''' ('''US&nbsp;45''') is a part of the [[United States Numbered Highway System]] that runs from [[Mobile, Alabama]], to the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] (UP) of the US state of [[Michigan]]. The highway forms a part of the [[Michigan Highway System|state trunkline highway system]] that is maintained by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] (MDOT). It enters the state from [[Wisconsin]] south of [[Watersmeet, Michigan|Watersmeet]], ending at an intersection with Ontonagon Street in [[Ontonagon, Michigan|Ontonagon]]. In between, the roadway crosses the UP running for approximately {{convert|54+3/4|mi|km}} through the [[Ottawa National Forest]] and parallel to the [[Ontonagon River]].

The highway dates back to the 1930s in Michigan. At the time it was extended into the state, it replaced sections of [[M-26 (Michigan highway)|M-26]] and [[M-35 (Michigan highway)|M-35]]. An {{convert|8|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} segment was significantly reconstructed in the late 1950s, and an alignment change in the 1970s moved the routing of US&nbsp;45 near [[Rockland, Michigan|Rockland]] before it was reversed soon afterwards. A segment of roadway that formerly carried US&nbsp;45 is the site of the [[Paulding Light]], a local phenomenon whose origins were scientifically described in 2010.

US&nbsp;45 crosses from Wisconsin to Michigan near [[Land O' Lakes, Wisconsin]], east of the [[Sylvania Wilderness]] area of the [[Ottawa National Forest]]. The highway angles northeast from the state line  before curving around to the north toward Watersmeet, where it intersects [[U.S. Route 2 in Michigan|US&nbsp;2]]. Watersmeet is home to the northern section of the [[Lac Vieux Desert Indian Reservation]]. Continuing north across the [[Gogebic County, Michigan|Gogebic]]<U+2013>[[Ontonagon County, Michigan|Ontonagon]] county line, US&nbsp;45 crosses the boundary between the [[Central Time Zone (Americas)|Central]] and [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] time zones.<ref name=MDOT09/><ref name=RM08/>

In southern Ontonagon County, the highway runs west of the [[Bond Falls]] Flowage near [[Paulding, Michigan|Paulding]]. North of here, the trunkline enters [[Bruce Crossing, Michigan|Bruce Crossing]] and intersects [[M-28 (Michigan highway)|M-28]]. After leaving town, US&nbsp;45 runs northward parallel to the Middle Branch of the [[Ontonagon River]], and the highway crosses the river near a roadside park south of [[Rockland, Michigan|Rockland]]. East of Rockland, US&nbsp;45 meets the southern terminus of [[M-26 (Michigan highway)|M-26]]; after the intersection, US&nbsp;45 turns northwesterly and runs parallel to the Ontonagon River<ref name="MDOT09">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Official Department of Transportation Map |year=2009 |scale= 1&nbsp;in:15&nbsp;mi&nbsp;/1&nbsp;cm:9&nbsp;km |cartography= MDOT |section=B3<U+2013>D3}}</ref><ref name="RM08">{{cite map |title=The Road Atlas |map= Michigan |publisher= Rand McNally |year=2008 |pages= 50<U+2013>51 |inset=Western Upper Peninsula |scale= 1&nbsp;in:30&nbsp;mi|section=A12<U+2013>C12 |cartography= Rand McNally}}</ref> and a branch of the [[Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad]] (ELS).<ref name="ashcraft">{{cite news |url=http://www.mininggazette.com/page/content.detail/id/506768.html?nav=5006 |title= Ontonagon Could Lose Rail Service |last=Ashcraft |first=Stacey |work=The Daily Mining Gazette |location=Houghton, MI |date= September 29, 2009 |accessdate=March 25, 2010}}</ref>

US&nbsp;45 enters the south side of [[Ontonagon, Michigan|Ontonagon]] on Rockland Road near the Holy Family Cemetery. The roadway turns due north and crosses the ELS rail line, still running parallel to the course of the river. South of downtown, the highway crosses an intersection that serves as the joint termini of [[M-38 (Michigan highway)|M-38]] and [[M-64 (Michigan highway)|M-64]]. M-64 crosses the river from the west on a bridge built in 2006 and ends at the intersection.<ref name="googleO"/><ref name="ORB">{{cite press release |first= James |last= Lake |url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdot/0,1607,7-151-9620_11057-153223--,00.html |title= New Ontonagon River Bridge to Open Oct. 11 |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |date=October 10, 2006 |accessdate=August 2, 2009}}</ref> M-38 comes into town from the east and also ends at the same intersection. US&nbsp;45 continues north on Rockland Road and turns northwest on River Street along the eastern river bank through downtown.

==History==
US&nbsp;45 debuted in Michigan by 1935 on maps of the time. The highway previously terminated in [[Des Plaines, Illinois]], until it was extended northward to Michigan.<ref>{{cite map |publisher= [[Illinois Secretary of State]] |year= 1934 |title= Official 1934 Road Map of Illinois |cartography= Rand McNally |section= A6<U+2013>A7 |scale= 1&nbsp;in:15&nbsp;mi |url= http://www.idaillinois.org/cdm/ref/collection/isl9/id/58 |accessdate= October 28, 2013}}</ref> US&nbsp;45 replaced [[M-26 (Michigan highway)|M-26]] between the state line north toward Rockland, as well as [[M-35 (Michigan highway)|M-35]] between Rockland and Ontonagon.<ref name="MSHD34-09">{{cite map |publisher=[[Michigan State Highway Department]] |title=1934 Official Michigan Highway Map |date=September 1, 1934 |scale= Scale not given |cartography= [[Rand McNally]] |section=}}</ref><ref name="MSHD35-05">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=1935 Official Michigan Highway Map |date=May 15, 1935 |scale= Scale not given |cartography= Rand McNally |section=}}</ref> The [[Michigan State Highway Department]] (MSHD) rebuilt an {{convert|8|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} section of the highway in the Military Hills area of eastern Ontonagon County starting in 1957.

A rerouting in late 1971 moved the US&nbsp;45 designation along M-26 between Rockland and [[Greenland, Michigan|Greenland]].
