'''Reginald Walter Saunders''' [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (7 August 1920&nbsp;<U+2013> 2 March 1990) was the first [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] [[officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]] in the [[Australian Army]]. He came from a military family, his forebears having served in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] and the First World War. Enlisting as a soldier in 1940, he saw action during the Second World War in [[North Africa]], [[Greece]] and [[Crete]] before being commissioned as a [[lieutenant]] and serving as a [[platoon]] commander in [[New Guinea]] during 1944<U+2013>45. His younger brother Harry also joined the Army, and was killed in 1942.

After the war Saunders was [[Demobilisation of the Australian military after World War II|demobilised]] and returned to civilian life. He later served as a [[company (military unit)|company]] commander with the [[3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (3 RAR) during the Korean War, where he fought at the [[Battle of Kapyong]]. Saunders left the Army in 1954 and worked in the logging and metal industries before joining the Office of Aboriginal Affairs (later the Department of Aboriginal Affairs) as a liaison officer in 1969. In 1971, he was appointed a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) for his community service. He died in 1990, aged 69.

Saunders was born near [[Purnim, Victoria|Purnim]] on the [[Framlingham, Victoria|Framlingham Aboriginal Reserve]] in western [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] on 7 August 1920.<ref name=AWM>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/people/302.asp|title=Captain Reginald Walter (Reg) Saunders, MBE|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> His father, Chris, was a veteran of the First World War, having served with the 10th Machine Gun Battalion.<ref>Forbes 2010, p. 289.</ref> One of his uncles, [[William Reginald Rawlings]], who had been killed in action and after whom Saunders was named,<ref name=Lennox157>Lennox 2005, p. 157.</ref> had been awarded the [[Military Medal]] for service with the [[29th Battalion (Australia)|29th Battalion]] in France.<ref name=AWM3>{{cite web |url= http://www.awm.gov.au/education/box/casestudy/03.pdf |title=Case Study: Reginald Saunders |work=Memorial Box 3: Too Dark for the Light Horse |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref> Another ancestor, John Brook, fought with the [[Royal Victoria Regiment|Victorian Rifles]] and the [[Australian Commonwealth Horse]] in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]].<ref name=Forbes271>Forbes 2010, pp. 271<U+2013>272.</ref>

His mother died in 1924 due to complications caused by pneumonia while giving birth to her third child, a girl, who also died.<ref name=Hall65>Hall 1997, p. 65.</ref> After this, Saunders' father moved to [[Lake Condah]] in Victoria,<ref name=abc>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/audio/2009/06/23/2604778.htm|title=Captain Reginald Saunders|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], South West Victoria|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> with Reg and his younger brother, Harry, who had been born in 1922.<ref name=Lennox158>Lennox 2005, p. 158.</ref> As their father undertook various labouring jobs, the two boys were raised largely by their grandmother.<ref name=AWM/> Saunders attended the local [[Mission (Christianity)|mission school]] at Lake Condah, where he did well in maths, geometry and languages. His father, meanwhile, taught Reg and Harry about [[the bush]], and encouraged them to read [[Shakespeare]] and Australian literature. After completing eight years of schooling, Saunders earned his merit certificate.<ref name=Ramsland180>Ramsland; Mooney 2006, pp. 180<U+2013>181.</ref> His formal education thus ended, he went to work at the age of 14 as a millhand in a sawmill.<ref name=Hall65/><ref name=Ramsland181>Ramsland; Mooney 2006, p. 181.</ref> Employers regularly withheld payments for Aboriginal labourers at this time; Saunders refused to work unless he was paid his full entitlement, and his employer relented.<ref name=Ramsland181/> During this time he largely educated himself and in 1937 he went into business with his father and brother, operating their own sawmill in [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]], Victoria, until it was destroyed in a bushfire in 1939.<ref name=Lennox158/><ref name=Ramsland181/>

==Second World War==

Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Saunders was determined to serve in the armed forces. Patriotism and his family's history of soldiery both played a major part in his decision. His father Chris suggested waiting six months however; according to Reg, "They were talking about this war being all over in six months with the [[Maginot Line]] and all the other garbage that we were told&nbsp;... But we waited six months and the duck season was over so there was no more shooting to do except go to war".<ref>Hall 1995, pp. 63<U+2013>64.</ref> Saunders enlisted in the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] on 24&nbsp;April 1940,<ref name=AWM/><ref name=nominal1>{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=A&VeteranID=789823|title=WW2 Nominal Roll: Service Record for Reginald Walter Saunders|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> joining up with friends he had made while playing [[Australian Rules Football]].<ref name=Lennox158/>  The armed forces later adopted a policy to accept only persons "substantially of European origin or descent", but at the time Saunders encountered no barriers to his enlistment.<ref>Hall 1995, pp. 67<U+2013>68.</ref> He recalled that his fellow soldiers "were not colour-conscious", and that during training in northern [[Queensland]] his white mates would sit alongside him in the "Aboriginal" section of movie theatres.<ref>Hall 1997, p. 70.</ref> His natural leadership qualities gained him temporary promotions in quick succession: within six weeks of enlistment he was a [[lance corporal]], and within three months he had made [[sergeant]].<ref name=Hall65/><ref name=Ramsland182>Ramsland; Mooney 2006, pp. 182<U+2013>183.</ref> 

After completing his training Saunders was allocated to an infantry unit, the [[2/7th Battalion (Australia)|2/7th Battalion]], which was serving overseas in North Africa at the time.<ref name=2_7th/> Upon reaching the 2/7th, Saunders reverted to the rank of private.<ref name=Ramsland182/><ref name=Lennox159>Lennox 2005, p. 159.</ref>  His first experience of war came fighting the Italians around [[Benghazi]].<ref name=AWM3/><ref name=Lennox159/> In early April 1941  the [[6th Division (Australia)|6th Division]], to which the 2/7th belonged, was sent to Greece to help defend against [[Battle of Greece|German invasion]].<ref name=2_7th>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11258.asp|title=2/7th Battalion, Second World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> Following a series of withdrawals the battalion was evacuated on 26&nbsp;April, embarking upon the ''Costa Rica'' at Kalamata.<ref name=Lennox159>Lennox 2005, p. 159.</ref> After the ship was attacked in Suda Bay by German aircraft and began to sink, the men from the 2/7th, including Saunders,<ref name=Lennox159/> were picked up by several British destroyers and disembarked on [[Crete]]. The 2/7th was subsequently allocated to the island's defending garrison.<ref name=2_7th/>

Following the [[Battle of Crete|invasion of Crete]] in May 1941, the 2/7th Battalion was initially employed in a coastal defence role before taking part in the fighting around [[Chania|Canea]]. After this it took part in a devastating bayonet charge at 42nd Street along with the New Zealand [[Maori Battalion]], which killed almost 300 Germans and briefly checked their advance.<ref name=2_7th/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/event_288.asp |title=Battle of 42nd Street |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref> It was during this battle that Saunders killed his first opponent:<ref>Thompson 2010, p. 355.</ref> "...&nbsp;I saw a German solder stand up in clear view about thirty yards away. He was my first sure kill&nbsp;... I can remember for a moment that it was just like shooting a kangaroo&nbsp;... just as remote."<ref>Forbes 2010, p. 291.</ref> As the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] began to evacuate the island, the 2/7th was called upon to carry out a series of rearguard actions in order to allow other units to be taken off the island. After the final Allied ships departed the island on 1&nbsp;June 1941, the battalion was left behind.<ref name=2_7th/> As a result, many of its men were taken prisoner; some were able to evade capture, however, by hiding out in the hills and caves around the island. Saunders was one of these, and with the help of a number of local inhabitants he managed to remain hidden for twelve months.<ref name=AWM/><ref name=AWM2>{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/fiftyaustralians/43.asp |title=Reginald Walter Saunders, MBE (1920<U+2013>1990) |accessdate=19 March 2008 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work=Fifty Australians |publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref>

The two men shared a tent during their officer training.<ref>Stanley 1997, p. 147.</ref>]]
Saunders managed to escape from Crete in May 1942.<ref name=AWM/> He subsequently returned to Australia where he rejoined the 2/7th, which had been reformed in Palestine before being brought back from the Middle East along with the rest of the 6th Division to help defend against the threat posed by Japan's entry into the war after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the [[Battle of Malaya|invasion of Malaya]].<ref name=2_7th/> In November 1942, Saunders' younger brother Harry, who had enlisted shortly after him in 1940, was [[killed in action]] while serving in [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] with the [[2/14th Battalion (Australia)|2/14th Battalion]].<ref name=AWM/><ref name=AWM3/> When Harry had joined up, Reg recalled, "I was angry because I was the only one that was supposed to go.&nbsp;... with two of us there, one of us was going to get killed&nbsp;..."<ref>Hall 1995, p. 65.</ref> The elder Saunders subsequently served in New Guinea as well, fighting in the [[Salamaua<U+2013>Lae campaign]] in mid-1943 where, having again been promoted temporary sergeant, he took over command of a [[platoon]] when its commander was wounded in action. For his leadership, he was recommended for a [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]] by his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Guinn.<ref name=Hall65/><ref name=Ramsland184>Ramsland; Mooney 2006, pp. 184<U+2013>186.</ref> When Guinn told him of his plan, however, Saunders laughed and said, "I don't want to be an officer&nbsp;... I'd rather be [[Regimental Sergeant Major]]". Guinn responded, "Christ, they don't make boys RSMs".<ref>Hall 1995, p. 79.</ref>

After sitting a selection board on the [[Atherton Tablelands]],<ref name=Forbes286>Forbes 2010, p. 286.</ref> Saunders was deemed a suitable candidate and posted to an officer training unit in [[Seymour, Victoria|Seymour]], Victoria.<ref name=AWM3/> Upon completion of the 16-week course, he was promoted to [[lieutenant]] in November 1944, becoming the first Aboriginal commissioned officer in the Australian Army.<ref name=AWM/><ref>Dexter 1961, p. 24.</ref> The precedent of his commissioning had caused the Army some concern due to its "special significance", and as a result the paperwork for its confirmation was eventually sent to the Commander-in-Chief, General [[Thomas Blamey|Sir Thomas Blamey]], for approval.<ref name=Dennis>Dennis et al 2008, p. 478.</ref> Nevertheless, Blamey is reported to have "insisted upon following the usual procedure", believing that there should be no difference in the way Saunders' commission should be treated to any other soldier who had completed the necessary training.<ref name=Hall65/> The story garnered much press coverage in Australia, most of it favourable if in parts paternalistic.<ref>Ramsland; Mooney 2006, p. 188<U+2013>189.</ref> After his promotion was confirmed, Saunders returned to New Guinea and, although it was contrary to policy, rejoined his old battalion. He subsequently took part in the [[Aitape<U+2013>Wewak campaign]], commanding a platoon until the end of the war.<ref name=AWM2/> He was wounded in the knee by Japanese gunfire during fighting around [[Maprik District|Maprik]], and was hospitalised for three weeks as a result.<ref>Hall 1995, p. 80.</ref><ref>Ramsland; Mooney 2006, p. 191.</ref>

==Interbellum and Korean War==

Following the end of the Second World War, Saunders was discharged from the Army on 5&nbsp;October 1945,<ref name=nominal1/> and returned to Australia.  He volunteered for service in Japan with the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]], but the government would not accept Aborigines for the operation.<ref name=Dennis/> Saunders spoke publicly against this policy, calling it "narrow-minded and ignorant".<ref>Ramsland; Mooney 2006, p. 193.</ref> The wartime restriction on non-European enlistments in the armed forces was not lifted until 1949.<ref name=Hall85>Hall 1995, p. 85.</ref> Saunders moved to Melbourne with his family, which by this time consisted of his wife Dorothy, whom he had married in 1944, and their three young children.<ref name=Lennox162>Lennox 2005, p. 162.</ref> Dorothy had served in the [[Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force]] during the war.<ref name=Hall85/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&VeteranID=952350|title=WW2 Nominal Roll: Service Record for Dorothy Mary Saunders|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=30 April 2012}}</ref>  Saunders recalled that he "had a hard time after the war&nbsp;... and poor old Dotty, she, you know, didn't know what the hell to make of it".<ref>Hall 1995, p. 86.</ref> Facing discrimination that he had rarely encountered as a soldier, he worked in the ensuing years as a tram conductor, a foundry worker, and a shipping clerk.<ref name=Lennox162/><ref>Ramsland; Mooney 2006, pp. 191<U+2013>192.</ref> After the Korean War broke out, in August 1950 the government called for Second World War veterans to volunteer to serve in Korea as part of a specially raised force known as 'K' Force. Saunders volunteered and returned to the Army as a lieutenant.<ref name=AWM/><ref name=ONeill64>O'Neill 1985, p. 64.</ref>

After undertaking training at [[Puckapunyal, Victoria]], and then in Japan in late September,<ref name=Lennox162/> Saunders arrived in Korea in November 1950. He served with the [[3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (3&nbsp;RAR), initially as a platoon commander in A Company. In February 1951, he took charge of A&nbsp;Company when its commanding officer was wounded; he was subsequently given command of C&nbsp;Company.<ref name=ONeill64/> Having been promoted to [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]], Saunders led C&nbsp;Company during the [[Battle of Kapyong]] in April, when 3&nbsp;RAR and a Canadian battalion held off a Chinese division north-east of the South Korean capital [[Seoul]].<ref>O'Neill 1985, pp. 154<U+2013>157.</ref><ref>Dennis et al 2008, pp. 302<U+2013>303.</ref>  Frustrated by the conduct of the war prior to Kapyong, he recorded that afterwards, "At last I felt like an [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|Anzac]] and I imagine there were 600 others like me".<ref>Forbes 2010, pp. 269, 382.</ref> The 3rd Battalion was awarded a [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|US Presidential Unit Citation]] for its part in the action. Saunders himself was recommended for a decoration but turned it down.<ref name=AWM3/><ref>Ramsland; Mooney 2006, pp. 194<U+2013>195.</ref> Leading a [[Vickers machine gun]] platoon at the [[First Battle of Maryang San|Battle of Maryang San]] in October, he reportedly shared the following exchange with a fellow 3&nbsp;RAR officer: as they surveyed the forbidding mountain before them, Saunders' companion remarked, "No country for white men", to which Saunders replied, "It's no country for black men, either".<ref>Forbes 2010, p. 406.</ref> He returned to Australia in November 1951.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreanroll.gov.au/veteran.aspx?id=1216665|title=Nominal Roll of Australian Korea War Veterans: Service Record of Reginald Walter Saunders|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref>

==Later life==
Following his service in the Korean War, Saunders remained in the Army overseeing training for [[Conscription in Australia|national servicemen]] at Puckapunyal. Away from active service, however, he soon became dissatisfied and in 1954 was discharged at his own request.<ref name=AWM/><ref name=Dennis/>  The same year, he married an Irish nurse, Pat Montgomery; his first marriage had broken down soon after he returned from Korea.<ref>Ramsland; Mooney 2006, pp. 196<U+2013>199.</ref> Saunders went to work in the logging industry in [[Gippsland]], after which he moved to [[Sydney]], where he was employed by the Austral Bronze Company.<ref name=AWM/> Seen by many as a role model and spokesman for Aboriginal Australians, in 1969 Saunders took up a position in the Office of Aboriginal Affairs as a liaison officer.<ref name=AWM2/> He later acknowledged, "I felt a sense of leadership of Aboriginal people and a desire to do something about Aboriginal situation, yes, yes".<ref>Hall 1995, p. 87.</ref> His community work was recognised in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] of June 1971 when he was appointed a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the Civil Division.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=45385|supp=yes|startpage=5994|date=4 June 1971|accessdate=28 July 2009}}</ref><ref name=honour>{{cite web|url= http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1086128&search_type=advanced&showInd=true|title=Australian Honours Database Search: Saunders, Reginald Walter|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> He continued to serve with the [[Department of Aboriginal Affairs]] in Canberra until retiring in 1980.<ref>O'Neill 1985, p. 671.</ref> In July 1985 he joined the Council of the [[Australian War Memorial]].<ref name=AWMtimeline>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/people/timeLine_302.asp|title=Captain Reginald Walter (Reg) Saunders, MBE&nbsp;<U+2013> Timeline|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref> He was also  involved in the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned and Services League]] (RSL), though he fell out with leaders [[Alf Garland]] and [[Bruce Ruxton]] over Garland's suggestion that Aborigines be blood-tested to determine their entitlement to government benefits. "They can take all the blood they want from me," Saunders declared in a 1986 interview, "and they'll never find out what I am &ndash; least of all an Aborigine &ndash; bloody stupid!"<ref>Hall 1995, pp. 88<U+2013>89.</ref>

During his two marriages, both of which ended in divorce, Saunders fathered ten children, two of whom predeceased him. He died on 2&nbsp;March 1990.<ref name=AWM/> Of his children, one of his sons followed him into the Army, while four of his daughters married soldiers.<ref name=Lennox157/> On 14&nbsp;December 2001, he was honoured with the dedication of Reg Saunders Way, which passes through the Canberra suburbs of [[Campbell, Australian Capital Territory|Campbell]] and [[Russell, Australian Capital Territory|Russell]], in a ceremony attended by the [[Secretary of Defence (Australia)|Secretary of Defence]], Dr [[Allan Hawke]], and the [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]], Admiral [[Chris Barrie (admiral)|Chris Barrie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/media/2001/495131201.doc|title=World War 2 Heroes to Be Honoured at Russell|publisher=[[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]]|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Reg Saunders Way|url=http://www.actpla.act.gov.au/tools_resources/maps_land_survey/place_names/place_search?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHAlM0ElMkYlMkYyMDMuOS4yNDkuMyUyRlBsYWNlTmFtZXMlMkZQbGFjZURldGFpbHMuYXNweCUzRm9iamVjdElEJTNEMTk4NDMmYWxsPTE%3D|work=Place name search|publisher=ACT Planning and Land Authority|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref> Saunders was also commemorated with a room in the Canberra Services Club,<ref name=abc/> and by the RSL's Captain Reg Saunders Scholarship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.det.wa.edu.au/detcms/inclusiveeducation/ies/community-relations/scholarships/general-scholarships/returned-and-services-league-of-australia-ltd---the-rsl-captain-reg-saunders-scholarship.en?oid=%5Bcom.arsdigita.cms.contenttypes.Article:%7Bid=255251%7D%5D|title=Returned and Services League of Australia Ltd&nbsp;<U+2013> The RSL Captain Reg Saunders Scholarship|publisher=[http://det.wa.edu.au Department of Education, Western Australia]|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref>
