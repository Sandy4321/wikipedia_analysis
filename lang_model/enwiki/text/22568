The '''pelagic stingray''' (''Pteroplatytrygon violacea'') is a [[species]] of [[Myliobatiformes|stingray]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Dasyatidae]], and the sole member of its [[genus]]. It is characterized by the wedge-like shape of its [[pectoral fin]] disc, which is much wider than long, as well as by the pointed teeth in both sexes, whip-like tail with extremely long tail spine, and uniform violet to blue-green coloration. It generally reaches {{convert|59|cm|in|abbr=on}} in width. The pelagic stingray has a worldwide distribution in waters warmer than  {{convert|19|C|F}}, and [[fish migration|migrates]] seasonally to spend the summer closer to the [[continental shelf]] and at higher [[latitude]]s. The only stingray that almost exclusively inhabits the [[open ocean]], this species is typically found in surface waters down to a depth of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. As a consequence of its midwater habits, its swimming style has [[evolution|evolved]] to feature more of a flapping motion of the pectoral fins, as opposed to the disc margin undulations used by other, [[benthic|bottom-dwelling]] stingrays.

The diet of the pelagic stingray consists of free-swimming [[invertebrate]]s and [[bony fish]]es. It is an active hunter, using its pectoral fins to trap and move food  to its mouth, and has been known to take advantage of seasonal feeding opportunities such as spawning [[squid]]. Like other stingrays, it is [[aplacental viviparous]], meaning that the [[embryo]]s are sustained initially by [[yolk]] and later by histotroph ("uterine milk"). With a short [[gestation period]] of 2&ndash;4 months, females may bear two litters of 4&ndash;13 pups per year. Birthing generally occurs in warm water near the [[equator]], with the exception of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], with the timing varying between regions. Rarely encountered except by [[fishery]] workers, the pelagic stingray can inflict a severe, even fatal wound with its tail spine. This species is caught as [[bycatch]] throughout its range; it is of little economic value and usually discarded, often with high mortality. However, there is evidence that its numbers are increasing, perhaps due to the heavy fishing of its natural predators and competitors (e.g. [[shark]]s). Along with the pelagic stingray's global distribution and prolific life history, this has led the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to assess it as of [[Least Concern]].

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The pelagic stingray was originally described by French [[naturalist]] [[Charles Lucien Bonaparte]] in the 1832 third volume of ''Iconografia della fauna italica per le quattro classi degli animali vertebrati''. He named it ''Trygon violacea'', from the [[Latin]] ''viola'' ("purple"), and designated two specimens collected off [[Italy]] as the species [[syntype]]s.<ref name="cas"/><ref name="ebert"/> The genus ''Trygon'' has since been [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymized]] with ''Dasyatis''. In 1910, American [[zoologist]] [[Henry Weed Fowler]] placed the pelagic stingray in the newly created subgenus ''Pteroplatytrygon'', from the Greek ''pteron'' ("fin"), ''platus'' ("broad"), and ''trygon'' ("stingray").<ref name="fowler"/> Later authors elevated ''Pterplatytrygon'' to the rank of full genus, though some taxonomists dispute whether this species is distinct enough to warrant separation from ''Dasyatis''.<ref name="ebert"/><ref name="rosenberger"/>

Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 [[phylogenetic]] analysis, based on [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], found that the pelagic stingray is one of the more [[basal clade|basal]] members of its family, being the sister [[taxon]] to a [[clade]] that contains ''[[Pastinachus]]'', ''[[Dasyatis]]'', and [[Indo-Pacific]] ''[[Himantura]]'' species.<ref name="rosenberger"/> Other [[common name]]s for the pelagic stingray include the blue stingray and the violet stingray.<ref name="fishbase"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
The distribution of the pelagic stingray extends nearly worldwide in [[tropical]] to warm-[[temperate]] [[pelagic zone|pelagic]] waters, between the [[latitude]]s of 52<U+00B0>N and 50<U+00B0>S. In the western [[Atlantic]], it has been reported from the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]] to [[North Carolina]], the northern [[Gulf of Mexico]], and the [[Lesser Antilles]], [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]]. In the eastern Atlantic, this species has been recorded from the [[North Sea]] to [[Madeira]], including the [[Mediterranean Sea]], as well as in the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and off [[South Africa]]. In the [[Pacific]], it is known from [[Japan]] to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] in the west, [[British Columbia]] to [[Chile]] in the west, and around many oceanic islands including [[Hawaii]], the [[Gal<U+00E1>pagos Islands|Gal<U+00E1>pagos]], and [[Easter Island]]. There have been no reports of this species from much of the [[Indian Ocean]], but it is known to be common in the southwestern portion and around [[Indonesia]].<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="mollet"/><ref name="ellis"/>

[[Image:Pelagic stingray monterey.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|alt=view from behind of a blue-green stingray swimming|The pelagic stingray is the only stingray found almost exclusively in open water.]]
Unique amongst stingrays in inhabiting the [[open ocean]] rather than the [[sea floor]], the pelagic stingray is generally found from the surface to a depth of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} over deep water.<ref name="iucn"/> It has also been caught at a depth of {{convert|330|-|381|m|ft|abbr=on}} over the [[Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc|Kyushu-Palau Ridge]], indicating that it at least occasionally approaches the bottom.<ref name="neer"/> This species prefers water temperatures above {{convert|19|C|F}}, and will die if the temperature drops to {{convert|15|C|F|abbr=on}}.<ref name="mollet"/>

The pelagic stingray performs seasonal [[fish migration|migrations]] following warm water masses.<ref name="ebert"/> In the northwestern Atlantic, it is found in or near the [[Gulf Stream]] from December to April, and moves north of the Stream to gather near the [[continental shelf]] from July to September. A similar migration seems to occur in the Mediterranean, though the specifics are unknown. In the Pacific, this species apparently spends the winter in oceanic waters near the [[equator]] and move into higher latitudes and towards the coast in spring.<ref name="mollet"/> Two Pacific populations are known: one migrates from near [[Central America]] to [[California]], and the other from the central Pacific to as far as Japan and British Columbia.<ref name="ebert"/> Off southeastern Brazil, pelagic stingrays are displaced towards the coast by upwellings of cold water in late spring and summer; in some years they may even be pushed into [[inshore]] waters less then {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name="siqueira and sant'anna"/>

==Description==
[[Image:Pelagic stingray2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=a thick-bodied purple ray lying on a carpet|The pelagic stingray is characterized by a wedge-shaped disc much wider than long, non-protruding eyes, and dark purple coloration.]]
The pelagic stingray has a very thick, distinctively wedge-shaped [[pectoral fin]] disc one-third wider than long, with broadly curved leading margins, rather angular outer corners, and nearly straight trailing margins. The snout is short with a rounded tip. The eyes are minute and, unlike in other stingrays, do not protrude above the body; the [[spiracle]]s (paired [[respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] openings) follow immediate behind. There is a short but broad curtain of skin between the [[nostril]]s, with a weakly fringed rear margin. The mouth is small and gently arched, with deep furrows at the corners and a tiny projection at the center of the upper jaw that fits into an indentation on the lower jaw.<ref name="last and stevens"/><ref name="mceachran and fechhelm"/><ref name="bester et al"/> There are anywhere from 0 to 15 forked papillae (nipple-like structures) in a row across the floor of the mouth. There are 25&ndash;34 upper tooth rows and 25&ndash;31 lower tooth rows; the teeth of both sexes have single, pointed cusps, but those of adult males are longer and sharper than those of adult females.<ref name="last and stevens"/><ref name="ebert"/><ref name="nishida and nakaya"/> The margins of the [[pelvic fin]]s are nearly straight in front and become rounded at the tips and in back.<ref name="mceachran and fechhelm"/>

The whip-like tail measures up to twice as long as the disc; it is thick at the base and tapers significantly to the extremely long, serrated spine placed approximately one-third to halfway along its length. Two spines may be present if a replacement grows in before the original drops off. Posterior to the spine origin, there is a low ventral fin fold that does not reach to the spine tip. Young rays are completely smooth-skinned; with age small prickles appear over the center of the back, as well as a row of small thorns along the midline from between the eyes to the origin of the spine.<ref name="mceachran and fechhelm"/> This species is a plain dark purple to blue-green above, extending onto the tail fold, and a slightly lighter shade below. When captured and handled, it exudes a thick black [[mucus]] that covers its body.<ref name="ebert"/> The pelagic stingray typically grows to {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|59|cm|in|abbr=on}} across.<ref name="last and compagno"/> The largest individuals on record are from a captive rearing experiment conducted from 1995 to 2000, in which a male reached {{convert|68|cm|in|abbr=on}} across and {{convert|12|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and a female {{convert|94|cm|in|abbr=on}} across and {{convert|49|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name="mollet et al"/>

==Biology and ecology==
[[Image:Pteroplatytrygon violacea monterey.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|alt=front view of a swimming stingray, with one of its wingtips flipped up|As an adaptation for living in the open ocean, the pelagic stingray swims more by flapping than undulating its disc.]]
In adopting a midwater lifestyle, the pelagic stingray exhibits several characteristics different from those of its bottom-dwelling relatives. While most stingrays propel themselves by undulating their disc margins, this species swims by oscillating (flapping) its pectoral fins in a manner approaching the "underwater flying" employed by [[eagle ray]]s. Oscillatory fin motions generate lift, thus improving cruising efficiency in open water at a cost to maneuverability.<ref name="rosenberger2"/> The pelagic stingray is adept at swimming backwards, which may compensate for the lower fine control offered by its swimming mode.<ref name="jordan"/>

Vision seems to be more important to the pelagic ray in finding food than in other stingrays. Compared to other members of its family, this species has less than one-third the density of [[electroreception|electroreceptive]] [[ampullae of Lorenzini]] on its underside. The ampullae also cover a smaller area, though not as small as in eagle rays, and are more evenly distributed between the ventral and dorsal surfaces. This ray can detect an [[electric field]] of well under 1 [[Volt|nV]]/cm at a distance of up to {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and may be able to pick up the minute electric fields produced by moving sea water. The [[lateral line]] of the pelagic stingray, a complex system of [[mechanoreceptor]]s that detect nearby movement and [[ocean current]]s, remains similar to other stingrays in covering a greater area on the ventral than the dorsal surface. However, this species is less responsive to mechanical than to visual stimuli.<ref name="jordan"/><ref name="jordan et al1"/><ref name="jordan et al2"/>

Pelagic stingrays may segregate by sex, vertically in that males are found in deeper water than females, and perhaps horizontally as well.<ref name="veras et al"/><ref name="ribeiro-prado and de amorim"/> Captive individuals often act highly aggressively towards [[ocean sunfish]] (''Mola mola''), biting and harassing them, particularly if they are hungry.<ref name="ebert"/> This species is preyed upon by [[oceanic whitetip shark]]s (''Carcharhinus longimanus''), [[great white shark]]s (''Carcharodon carcharias''), [[toothed whale]]s, and other large, ocean-going [[carnivore]]s.<ref name="ebert"/><ref name="bester et al"/> Its all-around dark coloration likely serves to [[crypsis|camouflage]] it against its featureless habitat.<ref name="wilson and beckett"/> The [[venom]] on its tail spine is also quite potent, causing it to be avoided by other fishes.<ref name="bester et al"/> Known [[parasite]]s of this species include the [[tapeworm]]s ''Acanthobothrium benedeni'', ''A. crassicolle'', and ''A. filicolle'', ''Rhinebothrium baeri'' and ''R. palombii'',<ref name="baer"/><ref name="euzet"/> and ''Tetragonocephalum uarnak'',<ref name="euzet et al"/> and the [[monogenea]]n ''Entobdella diadema''.<ref name="llewellyn and euzet"/>

===Feeding===
[[Image:Pelagic stingray monterey2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=a stingray swimming toward a school of small fish, which are splitting into two halves to avoid it|Small fish are one of the prey types pursued by the pelagic stingray.]]
The pelagic stingray is an active predator that captures prey by wrapping its pectoral fins around it, before manipulating it to the mouth. It is the only stingray in which both sexes have pointed teeth, for grasping and cutting into slippery prey.<ref name="ebert"/><ref name="veras et al"/> A wide variety of [[organism]]s are represented in its diet: [[crustacean]]s including [[amphipod]]s, [[krill]], and [[larva]]l [[crab]]s, [[mollusc]]s including [[squid]], [[octopus]], and [[pteropod]]s, [[bony fish]]es including [[herring]], [[mackerel]], [[sea horse]]s, and [[filefish]], [[comb jellies]] and [[jellyfish|medusae]], and [[polychaete worm]]s.<ref name="ebert"/><ref name="veras et al"/><ref name="wilson and beckett"/> Off California, pelagic stingrays hunt large mating aggregations of squid that form from November to April.<ref name="neer"/> Off Brazil, this species follows groups of [[largehead hairtail|Atlantic cutlassfish]] (''Trichiurus lepturus'') towards the coast in January and February, with both predators seeking small schooling fishes.<ref name="siqueira and sant'anna"/> Juvenile rays consume 6&ndash;7% of their body weight in food per day, which declines to just above 1% in adults.<ref name="ebert"/>

===Life history===
Like other stingrays, the pelagic stingray is [[aplacental viviparous]]: the developing [[embryo]]s are at first nourished by [[yolk]], which is later supplanted by histotroph ("[[uterus|uterine]] milk", containing [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s, and [[mucus]]); the mother delivers the histotroph through numerous thread-like extensions of the uterine [[epithelium]] called "trophonemata", which feed into the enlarged spiracles of the embryo. Females have only one functional [[ovary]] and uterus, on the left, and may produce two litters per year.<ref name="neer"/><ref name="wilson and beckett"/> Mating occurs from March to June in the northwestern Atlantic, and in late spring in the southwestern Atlantic.<ref name="wilson and beckett"/><ref name="forselledo et al"/> Females are capable of storing [[sperm]] internally for more than a year, allowing them to wait for favorable environmental conditions in which to [[gestation|gestate]] their young.<ref name="ebert"/> When first passed into the uterus, a batch of [[fertilization|fertilized]] eggs are contained in a single membraneous capsule tapered at both ends. Shortly after, the capsule ruptures to release the eggs, and is expelled from the uterus.<ref name="wilson and beckett"/> The [[gestation period]] may be the shortest of any shark or ray, lasting only 2&ndash;4 months, during which time the embryos increase a hundred-fold in mass<ref name="ebert"/><ref name="neer"/>

In the Pacific, females give birth in winter from November to March in a nursery area near Central America, prior to their northward migration. Similarly, in the northwestern Atlantic, birthing seems to occur in winter when the females are in warm southerly waters, possibly off the [[West Indies]]. However, records also exist of two possibly anomalous females that were pregnant much earlier in the year and would given birth in August or September, before their southward migration. In the southwestern Atlantic, birthing occurs in summer around January, again in warmer water towards the equator. As opposed to other regions, in the Mediterranean females give birth in summer before moving to warmer waters.<ref name="mollet"/> The litter size ranges from 4 to 13 (average six), and does not increase with the size of the female. Newborns measure {{convert|15|-|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} across.<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="hemida et al"/> Rays in captivity, with ample food, grow at an average annual rate of {{convert|8.1|cm|in|abbr=on}} (disc width), while rays in the wild grow at an average annual rate of only {{convert|1.6|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The food intake and growth rate of adults are highest in January-February and July-August, and lowest in March-April and October-November.<ref name="mollet et al"/> Males reach [[sexual maturity]] at {{convert|37|-|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} across and two years of age, and females at {{convert|39|-|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} and three years of age.<ref name="iucn"/> This species may live up to 10&ndash;12 years. One of the most productive rays, its intrinsic population growth rate is up to 31% a year.<ref name="dulvy et al"/>

==Human interactions==
[[Image:Pelagic stingray fukushima.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|a stingray with a long tail swimming next to a wall|A pelagic stingray at Aquamarine Fukushima, Japan; this species adapts well to captivity.]]
The pelagic stingray is not aggressive and rarely encountered because of its habitat preferences, but its very long tail spine demands extreme caution be exercised in handling it. It has been responsible for two known fatalities: a worker on a tuna [[longline fishing|longliner]] who was impaled by a captured ray, and another fishery worker who succumbed to [[tetanus]] days after being stung.<ref name="ebert"/> This species has been kept in [[public aquarium]]s for almost a century.<ref name="mollet et al"/>

The meat and [[cartilage]] of the pelagic stingray are sometimes utilized, for example in Indonesia, but for the most part this species is considered worthless and discarded when caught. Susceptible to longlines, [[gillnet]]s, [[seine fishing|purse seines]], and [[bottom trawl]]s, it is [[bycatch|captured incidentally]] in large numbers throughout its range. Rays caught on longlines suffer high mortality, as fishers are wary of being stung and remove the rays from the hooks by smashing them against the side of the boat, causing severe damage to the mouth and jaws. The extent of this bycatch has yet to be quantified.<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="fishbase"/> Regardless, surveys in the Pacific suggest that pelagic stingray numbers have increased since the 1950s, possibly due to [[commercial fishing|commercial fisheries]] depleting the dominant predators in the ecosystem, such as sharks and [[tuna]].<ref name="ward and myers"/> The lack of population declines, coupled with its wide distribution and high reproductive rate, has led the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to list this species under [[Least Concern]].<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="dulvy et al"/> Recent research has been conducted into reducing pelagic stingray bycatch on longlines by switching to larger and/or "C"-shaped hooks.<ref name="piovano et al"/>
