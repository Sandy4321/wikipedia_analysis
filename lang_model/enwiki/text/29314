A '''gravimeter''' is an instrument used in [[gravimetry]] for measuring the local [[gravitational field]] of the Earth.  A gravimeter is a type of [[accelerometer]], specialized for measuring the constant downward [[acceleration of gravity]], which varies by about 0.5% over the surface of the Earth. Though the essential principle of design is the same as in other accelerometers, gravimeters are typically designed to be much more sensitive in order to measure very tiny fractional changes within the [[Earth]]'s [[gravity]] of 1 ''[[g-force|g]]'', caused by nearby geologic structures or the shape of the Earth and by temporal [[tide|tidal]] variations.  This sensitivity means that gravimeters are susceptible to extraneous [[vibration]]s including [[noise]] that tend to cause oscillatory accelerations.  In practice this is counteracted by integral vibration isolation and [[signal processing]]. The constraints on [[temporal resolution]] are usually less for gravimeters, so that resolution can be increased by processing the output with a longer [[time constant]].  Gravimeters display their measurements in units of [[gal (unit)|gal]]s (cm/s<sup>2</sup>), instead of more common units of acceleration.

Gravimeters are used for petroleum and mineral [[prospecting]], [[seismology]], [[geodesy]], [[geophysical survey]]s and other [[geophysical]] research, and for [[metrology]].

There are two types of gravimeters: relative and absolute.  Absolute gravimeters measure the local gravity in absolute units, gals.  Relative gravimeters compare the value of gravity at one point with another.  They must be calibrated at a location where the gravity is known accurately, and then transported to the location where the gravity is to be measured.  They measure the ratio of the gravity at the two points.

==Absolute gravimeters==
Absolute gravimeters, which nowadays are made compact so they too can be used in the field, work by directly measuring the acceleration of a mass during [[free fall]] in a [[vacuum]], when the accelerometer is rigidly attached to the ground.

The mass includes a [[retroreflector]] and terminates one arm of a [[Michelson interferometer]].  By counting and timing the interference fringes, the acceleration of the mass can be measured.<ref>[http://www.microglacoste.com/fg5Principle.php Micro-g LaCoste, Inc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  A more recent development is a "rise and fall" version that tosses the mass upward and measures both upward and downward motion.<ref>{{cite web

==Relative gravimeters==
Most common ''relative'' gravimeters are [[spring (device)|spring]]-based. They are used in gravity surveys over large areas for establishing the figure of the [[geoid]] over those areas. A spring-based relative gravimeter is basically a weight on a spring, and by measuring the amount by which the weight stretches the spring, local gravity can be measured. However, the strength of the spring must be [[calibrate]]d by placing the instrument in a location with a known gravitational acceleration.

The most accurate relative gravimeters are [[superconducting]] gravimeters, which operate by suspending a liquid helium cooled [[Meissner effect|diamagnetic]] superconducting [[niobium]] sphere in an extremely stable [[magnetic field]]; the current required to generate the magnetic field that suspends the niobium sphere is proportional to the strength of the Earth's gravitational field. The [[superconducting]] gravimeter achieves sensitivities of one [[Gal (unit)|nanogal]], one thousandth of one billionth (10<sup><U+2212>12</sup>) of the Earth surface gravity. In a demonstration of the sensitivity of the superconducting gravimeter, Virtanen (2006),<ref name=Virtanen>{{Cite book

Transportable relative gravimeters also exist; they employ an extremely stable [[Inertial platform#Gimballed gyrostabilized platforms|inertial platform]] to compensate for the masking effects of motion and vibration, a difficult engineering feat. The first transportable relative gravimeters were, reportedly, a secret military technology developed in the 1950-60s as a navigational aid for [[nuclear submarine]]s. Subsequently in the 1980s, transportable relative gravimeters were [[reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] by the civilian sector for use on ship, then in air and finally satellite borne gravity surveys.<ref name=Stelkens-Kobsch>{{Cite book
