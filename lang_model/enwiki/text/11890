'''Uiwang Station''' (Station P152) is a ground-level metro station on [[Seoul Subway Line 1|line 1]] of the [[Seoul Subway]] in [[Uiwang]], [[South Korea]].  The station's four exits offer access to the Korean Railroad College, the Korean Railroad Museum and the Bugok Dong area of [[Uiwang]].  Travel time from Uiwang Station to [[Seoul Station]] on [[Seoul Subway Line 1|Line 1]] is 50 minutes.

==Disambiguation==
Note that "Uiwang Station" is also the former name of what is now known as Obong Station.  The two are separate entities.

==History==
Uiwang Station opened on May 1, 1944, under the name of '''Bugok Station''' (<U+BD80><U+ACE1><U+C5ED>/<U+5BCC><U+8C37><U+9A5B>), a name taken from the "dong" in which it is located.  Trains on the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway|Seoul Subway]] began calling at the station on August 15, 1974.  The current station building was completed on February 17, 2002.  On June 25, 2004, the station changed its name to [[Uiwang]] and almost three years later, on February 20, 2007, the ''hanja'' name changed from <U+5100><U+65FA><U+9A5B> to <U+7FA9><U+738B><U+9A5B>.

==Services==
The first train of the day on weekdays (not including national holidays) is at 5.22 a.m. northbound and 5.29 a.m. southbound, while the last is at 12.01 a.m. northbound and 12.14 a.m. southbound.  Northbound trains have various destinations.  Some terminate at [[Guro Station|Guro]], others at [[Seoul Station]], some at [[Dongmyo Station|Dongmyo]], others at [[Cheongnyangni Station|Cheongnyangni]], while some continue as far as [[Seongbuk Station|Seongbuk]].  None, however, continue beyond [[Seongbuk Station|Seongbuk]], so if travel beyond is required, it is necessary to change trains.  Some southbound trains terminate at [[Byeongjeom Station|Byeongjeom]], while the remainder continue to [[Cheonan Station|Cheonan]] or further south.
