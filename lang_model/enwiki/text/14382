As do all Pok<U+00E9>mon, Pikachu fight other Pok<U+00E9>mon in battles central to the anime, manga, and games of the series.<ref name=ign> [http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/389/389660p1.html ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby'' and ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Sapphire'' Review (page 1)] ''Ign.com''. URL Accessed [[June 1]], [[2006]].</ref> Pikachu is among the most recognizable of Pok<U+00E9>mon, due to the fact that a Pikachu is a central character in the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)|''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' anime]] series. Pikachu is the most popular Pok<U+00E9>mon,<ref name="Pikachu's Global Adventure"/> and is regarded as the official [[mascot]] of the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon franchise]].

The name ''Pikachu'' is a [[portmanteau]] of the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words ''pikapika'', an [[onomatopoeia]] for electric sparkling, and ''ch<U+016B>'', which is the Japanese onomatopoeia for a mouse's squeak.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} The name ''Pikachu'' refers to both the overall species, and to individual Pikachu within the games, anime, and manga series. Pikachu is also the name of an individual character that belongs to this species and is the Pok<U+00E9>mon companion of the anime's main protagonist, [[Ash Ketchum]].

In the Pok<U+00E9>mon franchise, Pikachu are often found in [[forest]]s,<ref name=diamond>'''Pok<U+00E9>dex:''' It lives in forests with others. It stores electricity in the pouches on its cheeks. {{cite video game|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond|developer=Game Freak |publisher=Nintendo |date=2007-04-22 |platform=Nintendo DS |language=English}}</ref> [[plains]], and occasionally near [[mountains]], [[islands]], and [[electric]]al sources (such as power plants), on most [[continent]]s throughout the world. As an [[Pok<U+00E9>mon types#Electric-type|Electric-type]] Pok<U+00E9>mon, Pikachu can store electricity in its cheeks and release it in lightning-based attacks.

==Biological characteristics==
Pikachu are designed as short, stocky [[mouse]]<ref name="dex"> The in-game [[Pok<U+00E9>dex]] of the ''Game Boy'' series ([http://www.pokemondungeon.com/pokedex/pikachu.shtml A copy of them from ''pok<U+00E9>mondungeon.com]'') URL accessed on March 27, 2006.</ref> Pok<U+00E9>mon that have short, yellow fur with brown markings covering their backs and parts of their tails. They have black-tipped pointy ears and light red circles on their cheeks, which are said to contain "electrical sacs".<ref name=diamond /> Their tails are shaped in the form of a lightning bolt. In [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl (video games)|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']], [[Sexual dimorphism|gender differences]] were introduced for some Pok<U+00E9>mon; a female Pikachu now has a "dent" at the end of its tail<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.serebii.net/diamondpearl/gender.shtml|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond/Pearl - Gender Differences|work=serebii.net}}</ref> giving it a [[Heart (symbol)|heart]] shaped appearance.

Pikachu [[Pok<U+00E9>mon evolution|evolve]] into [[Raichu]] via use of a Thunder Stone. However, it is somewhat common for Trainers to choose not to evolve their Pikachu into Raichu. For example, in ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow'', Pikachu refuses to evolve as attempting to use a Thunder Stone on it makes it cry and refuse. Also, from the second generation of the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' games onward, Pikachu has an evolutionary predecessor, [[Pichu]], which evolves into Pikachu after establishing a close friendship with its trainer.

==Roles==
===In the video games===
[[Image:Pokemon Yellow box.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow]]'', a variation of ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue]]'' incorporating many qualities of the anime.]]
In the video games, Pikachu is a typical low-level Pok<U+00E9>mon usually found around in [[Kanto (Pok<U+00E9>mon)#Viridian Forest|Viridian Forest]], and the Power Plant in the earlier games, or in the [[Safari Zone]] in the ''Ruby'', ''Sapphire'' and ''Emerald'' versions. [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Gold and Silver|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] add an item called the Light Ball. This item, when given to Pikachu to hold, doubles its [[Pok<U+00E9>mon game mechanics#Stats|Special Attack]] statistic.

The game ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow]]'' features a Pikachu as the representative Pok<U+00E9>mon, featured on the box art and as the only starting Pok<U+00E9>mon. Based off of the Pikachu featured in the Pok<U+00E9>mon anime, it refuses to stay in its [[Pok<U+00E9> Ball]], and follows the main character around on screen. The trainer can speak to it; it features many different reactions depending on how it is treated. Another game centered around Pikachu is ''[[Hey You, Pikachu!]]'' for the Nintendo 64<ref>[http://www.pokemon.com Hey You, Pikachu!] ''Nintendo.com'' URL Accessed [[July 17]], [[2006]]</ref> The player interacts with Pikachu through a microphone, and can issue commands to play various mini-games and act out situations. The game ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Channel]]'' follows a similar premise of interacting with the Pikachu, though without the microphone.<ref>[http://uk.cube.ign.com/objects/566/566823.html Pok<U+00E9>mon Channel] ''IGN.com'' URL Accessed [[July 17]], [[2006]]</ref> Pikachu is also one of the sixteen starters and ten partners in the ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Mystery Dungeon]]'' games.

Pikachu has also appeared in ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]''<ref name=bros>[http://www.smashbros.com/ Smash Bros.com] URL Accessed [[July 17]], [[2006]]</ref> and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]''<ref name=melee>[http://ssbm.detstar.com/ Super Smash Bros Melee.] ''detstar.com'' URL Accessed [[July 17]], [[2006]]</ref> as a very agile and mobile playable character, equipped with Quick Attack, Thundershock, and Thunder. In ''Super Smash Bros. Melee'',<ref name=melee/> Pikachu's Skull Bash move was introduced, and its Quick Attack ability was upgraded so that it did a small amount of damage to opponents. Pikachu is also set to appear in the upcoming ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'',<ref>Smash Bros. Dojo! [http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/pikachu.html Pikachu]</ref> and Volt Tackle will be introduced as its Final Smash.<ref>Smash Bros. Dojo! [http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/pikachu.html#3rd Pikachu: Final Smash]</ref>

===In the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' anime===
[[Image:Pok<U+00E9>mon episode 1 screenshot.png|thumb|right|Ash Ketchum and Pikachu together in the pilot episode, "[[Pok<U+00E9>mon, I Choose You!]]" ]]

The [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)|''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' anime]] [[Television program|series]] and [[film]]s feature the adventures of [[Ash Ketchum]] and his Pikachu. They travel the various regions along with various friends, such as [[Misty (Pokemon)|Misty]], [[Brock (Pokemon)|Brock]], [[May (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|May]], [[Tracey Sketchit|Tracey]] and [[Dawn (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Dawn]]. Many other wild and trained Pikachu appear throughout the series, often interacting with Ash and his Pikachu. The most notable among these is [[Richie (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Richie's]] Pikachu, Sparky. Like most other Pok<U+00E9>mon, Pikachu communicates only by saying syllables that are in its own name. Pikachu is voiced by [[Ikue Otani]] in all versions of the anime, except in the English language episode "Pok<U+00E9>mon, I Choose You!", in which [[Rachael Lillis]] played the role.

In the first episode, Ash Ketchum receives his Pikachu from [[Professor Oak]] as a starting Pok<U+00E9>mon given to all new trainers. At first, Pikachu largely ignores Ash's requests, shocking him frequently and refusing to be confined to the conventional method of Pok<U+00E9>mon transportation, a [[Pok<U+00E9> Ball]]. However, Ash puts himself in danger to defend Pikachu from a flock of wild [[Spearow]], then rushes the electric mouse to a Pok<U+00E9>mon Center. Through these demonstrations of respect and unconditional commitment to Pok<U+00E9>mon, Pikachu warms up to Ash, and their friendship is formed. Soon after, Pikachu shows a large amount of power that sets it apart from others. This causes [[Team Rocket]] to constantly seek to capture it in order to win favor from their boss, Giovanni.

===In other Pok<U+00E9>mon media===
[[Image:Baseset pikachu.JPG|right|thumb|Pikachu in the ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Trading Card Game]]'' (Base set).]]
Pikachu is one of the main Pok<U+00E9>mon used in most of the Pok<U+00E9>mon manga series. In ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Adventures]]'', [[Red (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Red]] and [[Yellow (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Yellow]] both train a strong Pikachu. It is originally captured by Red, but after Red goes missing two years later, Yellow, along with her own Pikachu, Chu Chu, accompany it. It is also featured in series based off of the anime, such as [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (manga series)|''Electric Tale of Pikachu'']] and ''[[Ash & Pikachu]]'', and other series, such as ''[[Magical Pok<U+00E9>mon Journey]]'' and ''Getto Da Ze''.

Pikachu has been seen in at least thirteen incarnations in ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Trading Card Game]]'' sets released in North America, and that number increases to twenty when limited edition promotional cards are included.<ref> [http://www.pokebeach.com/sets/exlegendmaker.html EX Legend Maker set card list] ''Pokebeach.com''.

==Cultural impact==
===Background===
Pikachu is the most well-known Pok<U+00E9>mon, and is regarded as the official [[mascot]] of the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon franchise]]. Pikachu is even regarded as the Japanese answer to [[Mickey Mouse]].<ref name="Pikachu's Global Adventure"> Tobin, Joseph. (2002) [http://www.nordicom.gu.se/common/publ_pdf/87_Yearbook%202002.pdf#page=55 Pikachu's Global Adventure] ''Children, Young People, and Media Globalisation'', The [[UNESCO]] Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media</ref> Pikachu is also regarded as being part of a movement of "[[kawaii|cute]] [[capitalism]]".<ref name= "Pokemon Capitalism">[[Anne Allison|Allison, Anne]] (2002) [http://web.mit.edu/cms/Events/mit2/Abstracts/AnneAllison.pdf The Cultural Politics of Pokemon Capitalism] ''Media in Transition 2: globalization and convergence''</ref> Pikachu are obtainable in all of the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon video games]] to date, with a prominent role in ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow]]''.
