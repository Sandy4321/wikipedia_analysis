In [[statistics]], the '''Vuong closeness test''' is [[likelihood-ratio test|likelihood-ratio]]-based test for [[model selection]] using the [[Kullback-Leibler divergence|Kullback-Leibler information criterion]]. This statistic makes probabilistic statements about two models. It tests the null hypothesis, that two models (nested, non-nested or overlapping) are as close to the actual model against the alternative that one model is closer. It cannot make any decision whether the "closer" model is the true model.

With non-nested models and [[iid]] exogenous variables, model 1 (2) is preferred with significance level <U+03B1>, if the [[z statistic]]

:<math>Z=\frac{LR_N(\beta_{ML,1},\beta_{ML,2})} {\sqrt{N}\omega_N}</math>

with

: <math> {LR_N(\beta_{ML,1},\beta_{ML,2})} = L^1_N-L^2_N-\frac{K_1-K_2} {2} \log N</math>

exceeds the positive (falls below the negative) (1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;<U+03B1>)-quantile of the [[standard normal distribution]]. Here ''K''<sub>1</sub> and ''K''<sub>2</sub> are the numbers of parameters in models 1 and 2 respectively.

The numerator is the difference between the maximum likelihoods of the two models, corrected for the number of coefficients analogous to the [[Bayesian information criterion|BIC]], the term in the denominator, <math>\omega_N \,</math>, is defined by setting <math>\omega_N^2</math> equal to either the mean of the squares of the pointwise log-likelihood ratios <math>\ell_i\,</math>, or to the sample variance of these values, where

:<math>\ell_i = \log\frac{f_1(y_i|x_i,\beta_{ML,1})}{f_2(y_i|x_i,\beta_{ML,2})}.</math>

For nested or overlapping models the statistic

: <math>2LR_N(\beta_{ML,1},\beta_{ML,2})\,</math>

has to be compared to critical values from a weighted sum of [[chi squared distribution]]s. This can be approximated by a [[gamma distribution]]:

:<math>M_m(.,\bold\lambda)\sim \Gamma(b,p)\,</math>

with

: <math> \bold\lambda=(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_m),\,</math>

: <math>m=K_1+K_2,\  b=\frac 1 2 \frac {\sum\lambda_i} {\sum\lambda_i^2}</math>

and

: <math>p=\frac 1 2 \frac {{(\sum\lambda i)}^2} {\sum\lambda_i^2}.</math>

<math>\bold\lambda</math> is a vector of [[eigenvalue]]s of a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of conditional [[expected value|expectations]]. The computation is quite difficult, so that in the overlapping and nested case many authors{{Who|date=February 2011}} only derive statements from a subjective evaluation of the Z statistic (is it subjectively "big enough" to accept my hypothesis?).
