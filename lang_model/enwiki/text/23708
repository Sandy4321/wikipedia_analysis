The '''White-faced Heron''', ''Egretta novaehollandiae'', also known as the '''White-fronted Heron''',<ref name="kushlan"/> and incorrectly as the [[Grey Heron]],<ref name="pizzey" /> or [[Blue Crane]],<ref name="kushlan">{{Cite book|title=The Herons |last=Kushlan |first=James Anthony |coauthors=Hancock, James, Thelwell, David |year=2005 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-854981-4 |page=170 }}</ref> is a common [[bird]] throughout most of [[Australasian ecozone|Australasia]], including [[New Guinea]], the islands of [[Torres Strait]], [[Indonesia]], [[New Zealand]], the islands of the [[Subantarctic]], and all but the driest areas of [[Australia]].

It is a relatively small [[heron]], pale, slightly bluish-grey, with yellow legs and white facial markings. It can be found almost anywhere near shallow water, fresh or salt, and although it is prompt to depart the scene on long, slow-beating wings if disturbed, it will boldly raid [[suburb]]an fish ponds.

==Taxonomy==
The species was originally described by ornithologist [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]] in 1790. It was historically considered to be closely related to ''[[Ardea (genus)|Ardea]]'' but for some time it was placed in its own genus because of the absence of the plumes typical in that genus.<ref name="kushlan" /> Appearance and behaviour are more closely related to those in the genus ''[[Egretta]]'', which DNA analysis has confirmed.<ref name="kushlan" />

Subspecies ''E. n. novaehollandiae'' and ''E. n. parryi'' in Australia, ''E. n. nana'' from New Caledonia and ''E. n. austera'' from [[Irian Jaya]] have previously been described, but are now not recognised taxonomically.<ref name="kushlan" />

The adult White-faced Heron is relatively small, pale blue-grey. The [[forehead]], [[crown (anatomy)|crown]], [[chin]] and upper [[throat]] are white. The crown pattern is variable, with the white occasionally spreading down the neck; the variability makes identification of individuals possible.<ref name="kushlan" /> The [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] may be grey, green, dull yellow or cinnamon.<ref name="kushlan" /> The regions between the eye and bill on the side of the head (lores) are black. The beak is black and often pale grey at the base.<ref name="kushlan" /> During the breeding season pinkish-brown or bronze [[nuptial]] plumes appear on the foreneck and breast, with blue-grey plumes appearing on the back.<ref name="mckilligan">{{Cite book|title=Herons, Egrets and Bitterns |last=McKilligan |first=Neil |year=2005 |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |isbn=0-643-09133-5 |page=104}}</ref>

The adult typically weighs 550&nbsp;[[grams|g]]<!--=5.5 kg--><ref name="nzbirds">[http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/whitefacedheron.html nzbirds.com - White-faced heron]</ref> and ranges from 60&ndash;70&nbsp;cm in height.<ref name="birdsinbackyards" />

Immature birds are paler grey with only the throat white,<ref name="pizzey">{{Cite book|title=Field Guide to the Birds of Australia |last=Pizzey |first=Graham |coauthors=Knight, Frank |year=1997 |publisher=[[HarperCollinsPublishers]] |location=Sydney, Australia |isbn=0-207-18013-X |page=111}}</ref> and often have a reddish colour on the underparts.<ref name="birdsinbackyards">[http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/finder/display.cfm?id=83 Birds in Backyards - White-faced Heron]</ref> Chicks are typically covered with grey down.<ref name="kushlan" />

==Distribution and habitat==
The White-faced Heron is found throughout most of [[Australasia]], including [[New Guinea]], the islands of [[Torres Strait]], [[Indonesia]], [[New Caledonia]], [[New Zealand]], the islands of the sub-Antarctic, and all but the driest areas of [[Australia]]. The species is now resident on [[Christmas Island]] but has not yet been recorded breeding there. It is also commonly found on [[Lombok]], [[Flores]] and [[Sumbawa]],<ref name="kushlan" /> and has appeared as a vagrant in [[China]],<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Short Communication: New Record of the White-faced Heron ''Egretta novaehollandiae'' in Xiamen (Amoy), China|journal=Emu|year=2000|first=Xiaolin|last=Chen|coauthors=Chen, Zhihong a& Fang, Wenzhen|volume=100|issue=4|page=340|doi= 10.1071/MU004SC|url=|format=|accessdate= }}</ref> the [[Cocos Islands]] and the [[Solomon Islands]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/search/species_search.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=3706&m=0 |title=Species factsheet: ''Egretta novaehollandiae'' |publisher=BirdLife international |year=2008}}</ref> It is mostly a winter visitor to the [[Northern Territory]].<ref name="pizzey" /> It was self-introduced to New Zealand in the late 1940s.<ref name="nzbirds" /> It is the only heron recorded breeding in [[Tasmania]].<ref name="mckilligan" />

The White-faced Heron is locally nomadic and found in both fresh and salty wetlands, farm dams, pastures, grasslands, crops, shores, saltmarsh, tidal mudflats, boat-harbours, beaches, golf courses, orchards or in garden fish-ponds.<ref name="pizzey" /> It is protected in [[Australia]] under the National Parks and Wildlife Act, 1974.

==Behaviour==
[[File:Egretta novaehollandiae in flight - Gould's Lagoon.jpg|thumb|In flight, [[Tasmania]]]]
The White-faced Heron typically perches on fence-posts, trees, telephone poles and house roofs.<ref name="pizzey" /> Its flight is slow and bouncing.<ref name="birdsinbackyards" />

===Call===
The most common call of the White-faced Heron is a gravelly croak or gobble,<ref name="pizzey" /> ''graak'' or ''graaw'' and is typically given in flight, in interactions or in aggressive encounters.<ref name="kushlan" /> Another call, ''gow, gow, gow'' is typically given upon returning to a nest.<ref name="kushlan" /> High pitched ''wrank, oooooooooh'' or ''aaarrrgh'' calls are given as alarm calls.<ref name="kushlan" />

===Breeding===
Breeding generally takes place in the austral spring, but the birds may breed at other times in response to rainfall.<ref name="birdsinbackyards" /><ref name="ausmus">[http://www.austmus.gov.au/factsheets/white_faced_heron.htm Australian Museum Online - White-faced Heron]</ref> Breeding generally takes place in southern [[Australia]], and birds disperse for long distances at other times of year. Both sexes share the task of building the nest, incubating the eggs and caring for the young.<ref name="birdsinbackyards" /> The [[bird nest|nest]] is an untidy shallow bowl, made of sticks and usually placed on a leafy branch 5&ndash;12&nbsp;m high,<ref name="pizzey" /> at altitudes from sea level to over 1000 m.<ref name="kushlan" /> When breeding the birds have long feathers ([[nuptial]] plumes) on the neck, head and back.<ref name="ausmus" /> A typical [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] has 3-5 pale blue eggs.<ref name="pizzey" /> with an average size of 48.5<U+00D7>35&nbsp;mm.<ref name="kushlan" /> Normally only one [[Avian incubation|brood]] is raised per year.<ref name="birdsinbackyards" /> Incubation lasts approximately 25 days.<ref name="kushlan" /> The parents guard the chicks for 3<U+2013>4 weeks and fledging takes place 40 days after hatching.<ref name="kushlan" /> Typical [[nestling]] predators include [[kookaburra]]s, [[Australian Magpie]]s, [[harrier (bird)|harriers]] and [[owls]].

===Feeding===
White-faced Herons eat most small aquatic creatures<ref name="imbimbie">[http://www.wildlifewalkabout.com/old/profiles.htm Bimbimbie ornithological services - Notable behaviours of White-faced Heron]</ref> and their varied diet is fish, frogs, small reptiles and insects.<ref>[http://www.birdphotos.com.au/White%20Faced%20Heron/default.html birdphotos.com.au White Faced Heron]</ref> It uses a variety of techniques to find food including standing still and waiting for prey movement (often employing a peculiarly rhythmic neck movement whether in water or on land), walking slowly in shallow water, wing flicking, foot raking or even chasing prey with open wings.<ref name="imbimbie" /> White-faced Herons generally feed solitarily or independently in small groups.<ref name="kushlan" /> White-faced Herons are generally territorial during breeding season but may feed in groups during non-breeding season, particularly after rain or flooding.<ref name="kushlan" />
