'''''Subspecies''''' is an American, [[direct-to-video]], [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[film series]] produced by [[Full Moon Features|Full Moon Studios]]. The series ran from 1991 to 1998, and followed the exploits of [[vampire]] Radu Vladislas, portrayed continually by Anders Hove, and his efforts to turn Michelle Morgan into his fledgling. A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film was released in 1997, which featured characters that would go on to appear in the final installment of the film series. [[Ted Nicolaou]] directed each of the five films, which included the spin-off; he also wrote the scripts for the sequels and spin-off. 

The series was shot [[Filming location|on-location]] in [[Romania]], utilizing [[stop-motion]] techniques to achieve the look the director wanted for the series' subspecies creatures. The series has had mixed reviews with critics citing vampire clich<U+00E9>s as a downfall of the films, but generally commending the director's choice in filming in Romania, as well as the special effects used in the film. 

==Films==
===''Subspecies''===
''Subspecies'' (1991) follows three college students, Mara, Michelle, and Lillian, as they begin a study on [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]] and [[superstition]] in the small town Prejnar. They are befriended by Stefan, a student studying nocturnal animals. It is revealed that the nearby Castle Vladislas has been caught in a power struggle between vampire brothers Stefan and Radu. Centuries prior, King Vladislas was seduced by a sorceress; that sorceress gave birth to Radu. After banishing Radu's mother, the king met a mortal woman. She gave birth to Stefan, who prefers to live in the open, and loathes his vampire heritage. Radu slays his own father to take control of the Bloodstone, a relic which is said to drip the blood of the saints. Radu discovers his brother's fondness for the girls and succeeds in turning two of the three into vampires. Stefan, having fallen in love with Michelle, helps try and free Mara and Lillian from Radu's control. Stefan drives a stake through Radu's heart and severs his head with a sword. Unfortunately, Michelle was bitten and infected during the fighting, and the only way to save her is if Stefan turns her with his own bite. As Stefan and Michelle sleep, Radu's minions set about resurrecting their master.<ref name="S1">{{cite video|people=Jackson Barr, David Pabian (writers) and [[Ted Nicolaou]] (director)|year=1991|title=Subspecies|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Full Moon Features]]}}</ref>

===''Bloodstone: Subspecies II'' ===
''Bloodstone: Subspecies II'' (1993) picks up directly after the events of the first film, with Radu's minions, the Subspecies, reattaching Radu's head and removing the stake from his heart. Radu find Stefan and Michelle sleeping, and immediately kills Stefan. The rising Sun forces Radu to seek refuge; Michelle wakes at sunset and finds Stefan dead in his coffin, with the Bloodstone still in his hands. Michelle flees the castle with the Bloodstone, hoping to contact her sister, Becky, for help. Radu, with the help of his mother, "Mummy", he sets out to find Michelle and the Bloodstone. Becky arrives in Romania, and, with the help of Lieutenant Marin  and US Embassy Agent Mel, attempts to find her sister. Michelle, who has been fighting her craving for blood, is captured by Radu. Becky is captured and given to Michelle as a way for Michelle to shed her mortal ties. Instead of killing her sister, Michelle stabs Radu in the face with an [[enchanted]] [[dagger]], and sets fire to Radu's mother, who flees the room in flames. Becky and Michelle attempt to escape the catacomb, but Michelle is halted by the coming sunrise. Becky promises to return that evening, but as Michelle descends back into the tomb she is grabbed by Radu's mother and carried off.<ref name="S2">{{cite video|people=Ted Nicolaou (writer/director)|year=1993|title=Bloodstone: Subspecies II|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Full Moon Features]]}}</ref>

===''Bloodlust: Subspecies III''===
Picking up where ''Subspecies II'' leaves off, ''Bloodlust: Subspecies III'' (1994) finds Michelle deep in the catacombs with Radu's mother, who is attempting to bring her son back from the dead, which she does with Michelle's blood and the enchanted dagger that killed him; Radu, his mother, and Michelle return to Castle Vladislas. Michelle promises to obey Radu if he teaches her everything that he knows. Radu takes Michelle out hunting so she can enhance her powers, while Mel contacts a former operative of the CIA for help. While trying to rescue Michelle, Radu's mother quickly kills Mel's CIA friend, and knocks Mel unconscious. In an effort to get Michelle to stay with him forever, Radu kills his mother for her. Becky arrives to save Michelle, but before everyone<U+2014>who includes Mel and a girl who was kidnapped by Michelle and Radu<U+2014>leaves, Michelle takes a gun, containing silver bullets, from Becky and shoots Radu. The rising sun slows Michelle, so she is placed inside a [[body bag]] that was brought along; the delay allows Radu time to catch up to the group. Wanting the Bloodstone, which was taken by Michelle, Radu attempts to [[barter]] the group's lives in exchange for it. Becky throws it over the roof's edge, and when Radu attempts to follow it he is engulfed in the rays of the Sun. Radu's body bursts into flames and falls from the castle wall. Becky and the group make it to their car and drive off. Radu's burning corpse is left smoldering on the tree branches that it staked itself on, with his burning flesh dropping to the ground; the flames go out and the flesh begin to morph into new Subspecies.<ref name="S3">{{cite video|people=Ted Nicolaou (writer/director)|year=1994|title=Bloodlust: Subspecies III|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Full Moon Features]]}}</ref>

===''Vampire Journals''=== 
''Vampire Journals'' (1997) is a spin-off of the ''Subspecies'' film series, featuring the vampire Ash. ''Vampire Journals'' follows Zachary, a vampire with a conscience, who hunts the vampire bloodline that condemned him to an eternity away from "the sun's warmth". After witnessing the love of his life get turned into a vampire, something he never wanted for her, Zachary destroys both her, and his master, and former prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> of Ash, Serena. Zachary, armed with the sword of a great [[Vampire hunter|vampire slayer]] called Laertes, seeks out the rest of Serena's bloodline to eradicate them. Zachary travels to Bucharest to find Ash. Zachary uses Ash's penchant for music and women to bait him out into the open for attack. Ash sets his sights on [[pianist]] Sofia, but is thwarted by Zachary during his first attempt to take Sofia. Ash does not give up, and hires Sofia for his nightclub. Over the next few nights drains her of blood, so that he may turn her into a new apprentice. While Ash is busy preparing to sire Sofia, he gives his daytime consult Iris the key to Zachary's room, so that she may dispose of his sleeping body in the sunlight. Jealous over Sofia, Iris releases Zachary instead. Zachary arrives a moment too late, as Ash has already spilled his blood into Sofia's mouth. Fighting off a weakened Ash, Zachary and Sofia escape from the nightclub. Ash follows them, but the rising sun becomes a problem. Zachary manages to get back the sword of Laertes and kill Ash, whose body falls into the Sun's rays.<ref name="S5">{{cite video|people=Ted Nicolaou (writer/director)|year=1997|title=Vampire Journals|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Full Moon Features]]}}</ref>

===''Subspecies 4: Bloodstorm''===
Like the previous two sequels, ''Subspecies 4: Bloodstorm'' (1998) begins with Radu's animated limbs grasping the Bloodstone and supplying his mouth with a few drops of Saint's blood. With some renewed strength, Radu manages to find refuge in his crypt. A car accident takes the lives of everyone but Michelle, who is discovered by a stranger named Ana. Upon seeing Michelle's reaction to the sunlight, Ana takes her body to her former professor, Dr. Nicolescu, who quickly determines that Michelle is a vampire. When Michelle wakes, Dr. Nicolescu promises to cure her of her vampirism. With his strength restored, Radu travels to [[Bucharest]] to claim the financial wealth one of his previous "fledglings", Ash, has acquired in the Vladislas name. Radu enlists Ash's help to track down Michelle, while Ash's own fledgling, Serena, attempts to play Radu and Ash against each other. Radu discovers Michelle's location, and Dr. Nicolescu agrees to give Radu what he wants in exchange for three drops of blood from the Bloodstone. Radu agrees, but it was only a trick to allow Dr. Nicolescu the opportunity to capture and stake Radu. Michelle arrives, releases Radu, and the two flee to safety. Serena arrives immediately after and gives Ana a key to the Vladislas crypt, where Radu is, with instructions to kill Radu. Ana and Dr. Nicolescu arrive at the tomb, but Radu awakens and kills Nicolescu. Radu turns his attention to Ana, but Michelle slices his throat, allowing Ana enough time to decapitate Radu. They burn his body and take the Bloodstone. Ash and Serena are waiting at the opening of the crypt, but a caretaker, hearing Ana's screams, opens the crypt and spills sunlight inside. Michelle is hidden in a coffin and transported out of the cemetery, while Radu's head sits on a pike burning in the sun.<ref name="S4">{{cite video|people=Ted Nicolaou (writer/director)|year=1998|title=Subspecies 4: Bloodstorm|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Full Moon Features]]}}</ref>

==Production==
[[Image:subspeciescreatures.jpg|thumb|upright|'''Upper image:''' The original subspecies creatures, as portrayed by local Romanian men wearing rubber suits<br>'''Lower image:''' The finalized version of the creatures was created from the use of stop-motion puppets]]

In 1991, ''Subspecies'' became the first American film to be filmed in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]. Director Ted Nicolaou was initially apprehensive about shooting [[Filming location|on location]] in Romania, but during a four-day location scout he came to love the location thanks to the free rein he had over the ancient ruins and woodland area.<ref name="Sub1">{{cite video|people=Various crew members|year=1991|title=Behind the scenes: Making of Subspecies|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Full Moon Features]]}}</ref> Other [[Transylvania|Transylvanian]] areas would be used for all ''Subspecies'' films, with specific location shootings at [[Hunedoara]], [[Bra<U+015F>ov]], and [[Sinaia]].<ref name="Sub2">{{cite video|people=Various crew members|year=1993|title=Behind the scenes: Making of Bloodstone: Subspecies II|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Full Moon Features]]}}</ref> Although, the remnants of communism left in the country, along with cultural differences and the general problems that accompany film productions leant to a difficult experience for the crew while shooting the first ''Subspecies'' film.<ref name="Sub1"/> 

The subspecies creatures, which were created from Radu's blood, originally began as local [[Romanians|Romanian]] men in rubber suits. The men were filmed on over-scaled sets to simulate the miniature size of the creatures. The performances of the Romanian men, along with the design of the rubber suits, caused director Ted Nicolaou to rethink his approach. Nicolaou brought in animator [[David W. Allen|David Allen]] to assist him in creating "more magical" looking subspecies creatures. Allen went through all of the film footage that contained the Romanian extras in their rubber suits with the film's editor in order to find usable footage before and after the men enter the scene. Allen would use the isolated footage to develop a new background for the animated creatures he would later create. Allen created two puppet types, displayed in front of a [[Chroma key|bluescreen]]: a [[stop motion]] puppet and a rod puppet. Each of the puppet types were composed of [[foam rubber]], and held similar skeletal systems. Some differences between the two types include tension filled joints for the stop-motion puppet, while the rod puppet was looser. The flexibility of the rod-puppet allowed for faster movements, which were needed occasionally for [[Real-time (disambiguation)|real time]] filming.<ref name="Sub1"/>

For ''Bloodstone'' and ''Bloodlust'', Wayne Toth and Norman Cabrera came on board to create the special make-up effects for the films; they also pulled double duty composing and performing the music, alongside Romanian musicians, for a portion of ''Bloodstone''. The limited budget that Toth and Cabrera had to work forced them to use any location they could find in order to apply the make-up to the actors, as they did not have a separate workstation. Make-up trailers would be created in local resident's homes, cave openings, inside of cars, or just sitting on the side of the road.<ref name="Sub2"/> To create Radu's face, Toth and Cabrera applied four separate prosthetic pieces to Anders Hove's forehead, left and right cheek, and his chin. A cosmetic make-up is applied over his entire face to help conceal those four prosthetics. This was the same process used in the original ''Subspecies'' film, although Toth and Cabrera admit to tweaking the coloring of Radu's skin. One major change to the make-up process was to Radu's hands. In the original film, Hove had to wear individual appliances on each of his fingers, but to cut back on the time needed to apply the make-up, Toth and Cabrera created a pair of prosthetic gloves that Hove could slip on his hands. For "Mummy", Radu's sorceress mother, a headpiece was cast from Pamela Gordon, which included her shoulders as well. After the make-up was applied to give the cast a "dry" and "mummified" appearance, it was slipped over Gordon's head leaving only her face showing. From there, Toth and Cabrera applied a separate face prosthetic. The facial appliance gave Gordon near zero visibility, having only a single eye slit for her left eye. The crew had to escort her around sets so that she would not injure herself. Gordon was given a pair of dentures to wear, as well as some prosthetic gloves similar to what Hover wore. The rest of Gordon's body was draped in clothing to conceal it.<ref>{{cite video|people=Various crew members|year=1994|title=Behind the scenes: Making of Bloodlust: Subspecies III|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Full Moon Features]]}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Culture Cartel'' critic Mike Bracken believed the story was "largely clich<U+00E9>d", coupled with "bad acting" on the part of Watson and the female cast, but commended the realism Nicolaou created by shooting [[Filming location|on location]] in Romania<U+2014>using Romanian residents for smaller roles in the film<U+2014>as well as the fact that the film does not "take itself too seriously", making it "more fun" than [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula|Dracula]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mike Bracken|url=http://www.culturecartel.com/review.php?rid=10002544|title=''Subspecies'' review|publisher=Culture Cartel|date=[[2002-02-22]]|accessdate=2007-11-07}}</ref> ''Cold Fusion Video's'' Nathan Shumate echoed Bracken's opinion on the "authenticity" created from the Romanian landscaping and actors that gave "the feel of [[verisimilitude]]", but criticized the stop-motion subspecies as being "irrelevant to the main action", and the story as a "general lack of urgency".<ref>{{cite news|author=Nathan Shumate|url=http://www.coldfusionvideo.com/s/subspecies.html|title=Subspecies (1991) review|publisher=Cold Fusion Video|date=[[2001-01-17]]|accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref> Richard Scheib, a critic for science fiction, horror, and fantasy review website ''Moria'', felt the original film "showed promise" when it attempted to go "back to the folklore roots of vampirism"; he also liked the authentic feeling from shooting in Romania, but felt the limited budget restricted the film from being convincing, with David Allen's stop-motion subspecies creatures being a disappointment.<ref>{{cite news|author=Richard Scheib|url=http://www.moria.co.nz/horror/subspecies.htm|title=Moria review of ''Subspecies''|publisher=Moria:The Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review|year=1996|accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref> When he had a chance to review ''Bloodstone'', Scheib felt the sequel delivered "vampire clich<U+00E9>s", but again "showed promise" with its imaginative make-up effects<U+2014>specifically the staking of Stefan, the reattachment of Radu's head by the subspecies creatures, the look of Mummy<U+2014>as well as the visual effects of Radu's shadow stalking Michelle through town, which gave Scheib a sense of ''Nosferatu''. Another criticism from Scheib was with the replacement of Laura Tate with Denice Duff; Scheib characterizes Duff as "internalized and afraid", as opposed to the addition of Melanie Shatner's character, Rebecca Morgan, whom he classifies as "alert and intelligent".<ref>{{cite news|author=Richard Scheib|url=http://www.moria.co.nz/horror/subspecies2.htm|title=Moria review of ''Bloodstone: Subspecies II''|publisher=Moria:The Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review|accessdate=2008-01-19}}</ref>

DVDschlock wrote that the film series "manage to give an edge of bad-assitude to its vampires," and that "each entertains in its own right and furthers the ''Subspecies'' tale one more step beyond the last one... until finally being beaten over the head by a shovel with the stinky ''Vampire Journals''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdschlock.com/2007/08/review-subspecies-epic-collection.html|title=''Subspecies'': The Epic Collection review|publisher=DVDschlock|date=August 2007|accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref> In a review by LaserDisc, it was felt that one consistency through the series was Radu, whose villainy is "effectively embodied" by Anders Hove. LaserDisc also believed that the sequels sustained the entertainment value through their intelligent use of eroticism, gore and on-location setting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dvdlaser.com/search/detail.cfm?ID=25904|title=Subspecies review|publisher=DVDLaser.com|accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref>
