'''Leroy Arthur Petry''' (born 29 July 1979) is a [[Sergeant First Class#United States Army|sergeant first class]] in the [[United States Army]] and recipient of the [[United States Armed Forces]]' highest combat decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for actions in 2008 during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].

Born in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], Petry had an active youth, and joined the Army after high school. Completing [[Ranger School]], he saw extensive deployments to both [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] as a member of the [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment]]. On 26 May 2008 during his seventh deployment, Petry was a member of a team on a mission to capture a [[Taliban]] target in [[Paktia Province]]. Despite being wounded in both legs by gunfire, Petry continued to fight and give orders. When a grenade landed between him and two other soldiers, Petry grabbed it and attempted to throw it away from them when it exploded, saving the soldiers' lives but severing his right hand.

Petry, who now wears a [[prosthesis]], became the second recent living recipient of the medal for the war in Afghanistan when he received the award from President [[Barack Obama]] in 2011. Opting to reenlist in spite of his wounds, Petry remains on [[active duty]] in the Army where he assists wounded soldiers and their families.  He is the only Medal of Honor recipient from any branch of service still on active duty.

=== Medal of Honor action ===
[[File:Petry Map.jpg|thumb|Map of the target building.|alt=Map depicting the target building, and surrounding area.]]

On 26 May 2008, [[Staff Sergeant]] Petry and his unit were on a mission in [[Paktia Province]], [[Afghanistan]]. He was assigned to D Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment,{{sfn|Collier|Del Calzo|2011|p=322}}{{sfn|Markovics|Pushies|2012|p=6}} which was on a daylight raid to capture a high-value target from the [[Taliban]]. Petry was to locate himself with the platoon headquarters in the target building once it was secured. Once there, he was to serve as the [[Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge|senior noncommissioned officer]] at the site for the remainder of the operation.<ref name="NT31MAY11">{{citation|title=Wounded Ranger to be awarded Medal of Honor |url=http://www.navytimes.com/news/2011/05/ap-leroy-arthur-petry-medal-of-honor-053111/ |newspaper=[[Navy Times]] |date=31 May 2011 |accessdate=22 January 2013 |location=[[Washington, D.C.]]}}</ref> The operation involved about 70 Rangers, who encountered about 40 Taliban, 12 of them armed.<ref name="KM10JUN11LAT">{{citation|title=Soldier to receive Medal of Honor |last=Murphy |first=Kim |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/10/nation/la-na-medal-of-honor-20110610 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=10 June 2011 |accessdate=22 January 2013 |location=[[Los Angeles, California]]}}</ref> Almost immediately after getting out of the helicopters that delivered the unit to the attack site, the Rangers came under strong fire.{{sfn|Markovics|Pushies|2012|p=6}} Petry provided additional supervision to an assaulting squad during the clearance of a building, and afterward he took [[Private First Class#United States Army|Private First Class]] Lucas Robinson to clear the outer courtyard that had not yet been cleared.<ref name="MOHProfile"/>

Three Taliban fighters were in the courtyard, which had a chicken coop within it. The Taliban fired on Petry and Robinson; Petry was wounded by one round which went through both his legs,{{sfn|Collier|Del Calzo|2011|p=322}} and Robinson was wounded, being hit on the armor plate protecting his side. Petry led Robinson to the [[Cover (military)|cover]] of the chicken coop and reported the contact and their wounded condition. Petry threw a [[thermobaric]] [[grenade]] from cover. There at the chicken coop, they were joined by [[Sergeant#Army 13|Sergeant]] Daniel Higgins, who assessed the wounds of the two soldiers.<ref name="MOHProfile"/><ref name="KM10JUN11LAT"/>

A Taliban fighter threw a grenade at their position which landed 10 meters from them; it detonated, and the blast knocked the three soldiers to the ground, wounding Higgins, and further wounding Robinson.<ref name="MOHProfile"/> Shortly thereafter the three were joined by Staff Sergeant James Roberts and [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] Christopher Gathercole. Another grenade was thrown by a Taliban fighter which landed a few feet from Higgins and Robinson. Petry, knowing the risk to his life, moved toward the grenade, picked it up, and attempted to throw it in the direction of the Taliban.{{sfn|Markovics|Pushies|2012|p=7}} Petry later recalled his immediate reaction was "get it out of here, get it away from the guys and myself. And I reached over, leaned over to the right, grabbed it with my hand, and I threw it as hard as I could, what I thought was at the time. And as soon as I opened my hand to let it go, it just exploded instantly. And I came back, and the hand was completely severed off."<ref name="ABC13JUL">{{citation |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-honors-medal-honor-recipient-sgt-1st-class/story?id=14066750|title=Pentagon Honors Medal of Honor Recipient, Sgt. 1st Class Leroy Petry |last=Matinez |first=Luis |date=13 July 2011  |publisher=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=22 January 2013 |location=[[New York City, New York]]}}</ref> The detonation amputated his right hand, and sprayed his body with [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]].{{sfn|Collier|Del Calzo|2011|p=329}} In throwing the grenade away, Petry likely saved the two other soldiers from serious injury or death.{{sfn|Markovics|Pushies|2012|p=8}}<ref name="KM10JUN11LAT"/>

Petry placed a [[tourniquet]] on his right arm.{{sfn|Collier|Del Calzo|2011|p=322}} Roberts began to fire at the Taliban fighters, [[Suppressive fire|suppressing]] them in the courtyard. An additional fighter on the east end of the courtyard fired, fatally wounding Gathercole.<ref name="MOHProfile"/> Higgins and Robinson returned fire, killing that fighter.{{sfn|Collier|Del Calzo|2011|p=322}} They were then joined by Sergeant First Class Jerod Staidle, the [[Platoon sergeant#United States|platoon sergeant]], and Specialist Gary Depriest, a [[68W|medic]]. Directing the medic to treat Gathercole, Petry was assisted by Staide and Higgins to the [[Medical evacuation|casualty collection point]].<ref name="MOHProfile"/>

=== Subsequent service ===
Petry's wounds resulted in the loss of his right arm below the elbow. He was evacuated to a U.S. hospital in Germany, where he spent several weeks in recovery before being transferred to [[Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center]] in [[Fort Hood]], Texas.<ref name="lcsn20110604"/> He now uses an advanced [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] in place of his right hand. On the prosthetic is a small [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] listing the names of the fallen Rangers of his regiment. After recovering, Petry did not seek a medical [[Military discharge|discharge]]; instead, he deployed to Afghanistan between recovering and receiving the Medal of Honor.<ref name="MOHProfile"/> He was later promoted to the rank of [[sergeant first class]].{{sfn|Markovics|Pushies|2012|p=6}}

{{quotation|For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty:
Staff Sergeant Leroy A. Petry distinguished himself by acts of gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty in action with an armed enemy in the vicinity of Paktya Province, Afghanistan, on May 26, 2008. As a Weapons Squad Leader with D Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, Staff Sergeant Petry moved to clear the courtyard of a house that potentially contained high-value combatants. While crossing the courtyard, Staff Sergeant Petry and another Ranger were engaged and wounded by automatic weapons fire from enemy fighters. Still under enemy fire, and wounded in both legs, Staff Sergeant Petry led the other Ranger to cover. He then reported the situation and engaged the enemy with a hand grenade, providing suppression as another Ranger moved to his position. The enemy quickly responded by maneuvering closer and throwing grenades. The first grenade explosion knocked his two fellow Rangers to the ground and wounded both with shrapnel. A second grenade then landed only a few feet away from them. Instantly realizing the danger, Staff Sergeant Petry, unhesitatingly and with complete disregard for his safety, deliberately and selflessly moved forward, picked up the grenade, and in an effort to clear the immediate threat, threw the grenade away from his fellow Rangers. As he was releasing the grenade it detonated, amputating his right hand at the wrist and further injuring him with multiple shrapnel wounds. Although picking up and throwing the live grenade grievously wounded Staff Sergeant Petry, his gallant act undeniably saved his fellow Rangers from being severely wounded or killed. Despite the severity of his wounds, Staff Sergeant Petry continued to maintain the presence of mind to place a tourniquet on his right wrist before communicating the situation by radio in order to coordinate support for himself and his fellow wounded Rangers. Staff Sergeant Petry's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service, and reflect great credit upon himself, 75th Ranger Regiment, and the United States Army.<ref name="MOHProfile"/>}}
