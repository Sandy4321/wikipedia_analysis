The '''2010 Gascoyne River flood''' was regarded as the most severe flood to take place along the [[Gascoyne River]] in Western Australia on record.<ref name="ABC5"/> Triggered by record-breaking rainfall, amounting to over 6,000 percent of the monthly mean, {{convert|313.6|mm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|5|mm|in|abbr=on}} respectively, in just four days, the floods caused widespread damage in the region. By 17 December, the river began to rise in response to the heavy rains, eventually exceeding its banks within two days. Water levels reached record values at three stations along the river, cresting at {{convert|15.53|m|ft|abbr=on}} near [[Fishy Pool, Western Australia|Fishy Pool]]. Evacuation orders were issued for several towns affected by rising waters. The most substantial impact was felt in [[Carnarvon, Western Australia|Carnarvon]] where entire homes were washed away. Following the disaster, emergency supplies and funds were distributed to affected residents to aid them in restoring their livelihoods. Though no people died in the event, an estimated two thousand head of cattle perished and damage was estimated at A$100&nbsp;million.

==Background==
[[File:Gascoyne.jpg|thumb|left|The normally dry Gascoyne Riverbed in February 2009]]
On 11 December 2010, a [[monsoon trough]] developed northwest of Western Australia. Slowly tracking to the south, the system spawned an [[Low pressure area|low pressure system]] ([[2010<U+2013>11 Australian region cyclone season#Storms|2010<U+2013>11 Australian cyclone <U+2013> Tropical Low 03U]]) by 15 December. Turning southeastward, the low later made [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near [[Coral Bay, Western Australia|Coral Bay]] on 18 December. Within hours of moving inland, the system turned to the southwest and moved back over water the following morning. The storm was last noted on 20 December well off the coast of Western Australia.<ref name="BOM"/>

Climatologically, the region affected by the floods is a dry area, with annual rainfall in most areas averaging between {{convert|200|and|300|mm|abbr=on}}. December is regarded as the third-driest month of the year, with a mean rainfall of just {{convert|5|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="BOM"/><ref name="CarnarvonAVG">{{cite web|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology|year=2010|accessdate=14 January 2011|title=Climate statistics for Carnarvon, Western Australia|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_006011.shtml}}</ref> Prior to the event, much of the Gascoyne River catchment was suffering from a drought and many places abruptly shifted from drought conditions to record floods in less than 24&nbsp;hours. Additionally, the river had no water flow before the floods, being a dry riverbed.<ref name="BOM"/>

Between 16 and 20 December, the low produced heavy rains over much of the area around [[Shark Bay]]. These rains reached record amounts in numerous locations and greatly surpassed the monthly mean December rainfall; some areas reached levels of more than 6,000 percent above this value due to the storm. During a 24&nbsp;hour span on 17 December, a record-shattering {{convert|247.6|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain fell in [[Carnarvon, Western Australia|Carnarvon]]. This value greatly exceeded both the previous record of {{convert|119.4|mm|in|abbr=on}}, set in 1923, and the city's annual average of {{convert|228.8|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="BOM"/><ref name="CarnarvonAVG"/> Several other locations recorded similar rainfall in the region, also surpassing their annual rainfall totals in under two days. During the five-day span in which there was rainfall, a maximum of {{convert|313.6|mm|in|abbr=on}} was measured in Carnarvon.<ref name="BOM"/> A total of 23 stations and towns recorded record 24&nbsp;hour rainfall for the month of December in relation to the storm.<ref name="MCS">{{cite web|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology|date=4 January 2011|accessdate=16 February 2011|title=Western Australia in December 2010: Record wet month in the northwest|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/month/wa/archive/201012.summary.shtml}}</ref> According to the [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]], [[Carnarvon Airport (Australia)|Carnarvon Airport]] measured its wettest month on record, with {{convert|255|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain falling in just four days. The previous record was set in June 1895 at {{convert|219.7|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="BOM"/>

Prior to the arrival of the monsoon low, the Bureau of Meteorology issued a [[flood watch]] for the Gascoyne River catchment on 15 December, stating that {{convert|150|to|200|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain could fall over the following 72&nbsp;hours. This was later upgraded to a [[flood warning]] as the situation worsened on 18 December. Once the rains ceased on 21 December, the warning was discontinued.<ref name="BOM"/> During the torrential downpours, the Gascoyne River began to rise on 17 December, threatening to flood several towns along its banks. Water levels continuously rose through the morning of 19 December, at which time the floods attained their peak. In [[Fishy Pool, Western Australia|Fishy Pool]], the river reached a record crest of {{convert|15.53|m|ft|abbr=on}}, surpassing the previous peak of {{convert|12.23|m|ft|abbr=on}} in 1980. The floods subsided relatively quickly as the river dropped below flood stage on 21 December.<ref name="BOM"/>

Once the river overflowed its banks, flood waters spread through vast agricultural and grazing areas, severely damaging crops and killing an estimated two thousand head of cattle.<ref name="BOM"/> By 19 December, evacuations had taken place in rural parts of Carnarvon, with 200 residents residing in emergency shelters. The entire town was isolated from surrounding areas as flood waters cut off all roads; however, the main centre of the town remained untouched due to [[levee]]s that were constructed in 1960. On person had to be rescued by a police helicopter after he was swept away by strong currents.<ref name="ABC1">{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=20 December 2010|accessdate=14 January 2011|title=Floodwaters force evacuations in Carnarvon|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vjgtBB6B}}</ref> Large portions of the [[North West Coastal Highway]] were shut down due to flooding for several days, hindering travel in the region.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=18 December 2010|accessdate=14 January 2011|title=Residents evacuate as Carnarvon flood looms|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vjkDu31i}}</ref> In [[Yalgoo, Western Australia|Yalgoo]], six residents required an airlift after becoming stranded in their home.

Several homesteads near Gascoyne Junction were washed away in the floods.<ref name="ABC4"/> and the center of the Gascoyne Junction township was referred to as an, "obliterated ghost town."<ref name="ABC5">{{cite web|author=Cristy-Lee Macqueen |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=4 February 2011|accessdate=16 February 2011|title=Survival, recovery and Aussie spirit-Gascoyne locals share their stories|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wXkX1Sj2}}</ref> Additionally, one person stated that he lost 50 percent of his banana crop.<ref name="ABC4"/> Throughout the affected area, preliminary assessments placed damage at A$100&nbsp;million.<ref name="BOM"/>

==Response==
By 20 December, arrangements for the delivery of emergency food and water supplies were made and expected to reach Carnarvon later that day.<ref name="ABC1"/> Supplies were also sent to outlying Aboriginal communities affected by the floods. After evacuating on 20 December, residents were allowed to return to their homes two days later in Carnarvon. However, most were left without power and clean water and required assistance from local agencies.<ref name="ABC3"/> Following the disaster, there were concerns that the Australian government could have prevented at least some of the floods by following through with a flood mitigation program. Dudley Maslen, the President of The [[Shire of Carnarvon]] stated that he did not want to place blame on any agency, though hoped for improvement during the future.<ref name="ABC4">{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=22 December 2010|accessdate=14 January 2011|title=Government warned about flood potential|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vjkfKuCH}}</ref> More than 100 local government areas and regions were declared natural disaster areas on 21 December, encompassing areas from central Western Australia to the [[Pilbara]] coastline.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Weber|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=21 December 2010|accessdate=14 January 2011|title=WA regions declared natural disaster zones|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vjlLBzmX}}</ref>

By January 2011, much of the nation's attention had shifted from the Gascoyne flood to the [[2010<U+2013>2011 Queensland floods|devastating floods in Queensland]]. Many residents struggling to get their lives back together were frustrated with the government and demanded aid. Though people affected by the floods were to be given A$15,000 in funds, they expressed further anger after hearing that residents in Queensland would receive A$25,000.<ref>{{cite web|author=Australian Associated Press|publisher=''The Sydney Morning Herald''|date=7 January 2011|accessdate=15 January 2011|title=Grower confronts PM over WA flood aid |url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vlf3FV0D}}</ref> On 11 January, Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] stated that the imbalance in funds was to be corrected and residents of Western Australia would receive equal amounts to those in Queensland.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nicholas Perpitch and Amos Aikman|publisher=''The Australian''|date=11 January 2011|accessdate=15 January 2011|title=West to receive equal aid funds for flood relief|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5vlfLbGov}}</ref> By 20 January, donations for flood victims from the Lord Mayor's Distress Relief Fund exceeded A$1&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|author=City of Perth|publisher=Government of Australia|date=20 January 2011|accessdate=9 February 2011|title=Gascoyne flood appeal passes million mark|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wNJ4av7z}}</ref> Power restoration, especially in Gascoyne Junction, was unusually sluggish. Dozens of residents were without power for eight weeks, as electricity was finally restored between 12 and 13 February. This coincided with the arrival of replacement furniture from [[Paraburdoo, Western Australia|Paraburdoo]]; however, heavy rains renewed flooding and prevented most residents from picking up the supplies.<ref>{{cite web|author=Cristy-Lee Macqueen |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=16 February 2011|accessdate=16 February 2011|title=Heavy rain may cause further flooding|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wXk5rgUK}}</ref>
