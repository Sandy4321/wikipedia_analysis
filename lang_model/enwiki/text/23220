The '''Earth-grazing meteoroid of 13&nbsp;October 1990''' was a [[meteoroid]] with an estimated mass of 44&nbsp;kg that entered [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] above [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Poland]] and, after a few seconds, returned to space. [[Observational astronomy|Observations]] of such events are quite rare; this was the second to be recorded using scientific astronomical instruments (after the [[1972&nbsp;Great Daylight Fireball]]) and the first to be recorded from two distant positions, which enabled the calculation of several of its orbital characteristics. The encounter with [[Earth]] significantly changed its orbit and, to a smaller extent, some of its physical properties ([[mass]] and structure of its upper layer).

== Observations ==
Visual observations were reported by three independent [[comet]] observers: Czech astronomers [[Petr Pravec]], Pavel Kl<U+00E1>sek, and Lucie Bul<U+00ED><U+010D>kov<U+00E1>. According to their report, the event started at 03:27:16<U+00B1>3 [[Universal Time|UT]]<ref name="time" group="note">The record is in [[Universal Time]] (UT), local [[Central European Time]] (CET) was 1&nbsp;hour later.</ref> and the observed bright [[meteor]] ([[fireball (meteor)|fireball]]) was moving from the south to the north. It left a track that was visible for 10&nbsp;seconds.<ref name="AA"/>

Most data about the encounter were acquired using photographic observations by cameras of the [[European Fireball Network]]. It was the first event of this type recorded by cameras from two distant locations, at [[<U+010C>erven<U+00E1> hora (N<U+00ED>zk<U+00FD> Jesen<U+00ED>k)|<U+010C>erven<U+00E1> hora]] and [[Svratouch]] (both in what is now the [[Czech Republic]]), which enabled the calculation of the meteoroid's orbital characteristics by geometrical methods.<ref name="AA"/> Both were equipped with all-sky [[Fisheye lens|fisheye objectives]].<ref name="AA"/>

The <U+010C>erven<U+00E1> hora image was especially valuable. It recorded the fireball's trajectory over approximately 110<U+00B0>, starting 51<U+00B0> above the southern horizon, passing the [[zenith]] just 1<U+00B0> westward and disappearing only 19<U+00B0> above the northern horizon (thus crossing about 60% of the sky). Its camera was also equipped with a rotating shutter that interrupted the exposure 12.5 times per second and divided the captured track of the fireball, allowing the determination of its speed. Over the last 4<U+00B0>, the fireball's [[angular velocity]] was lower than the resolution of the instrument.<ref name="AA"/> The Svratouch image recorded the trajectory only for about 15<U+00B0>, beginning at 30<U+00B0> above the northwest horizon, and the pictured fireball was quite weak. Despite this, the data were sufficient for the calculations.<ref name="AA"/>

Gotfred M. Kristensen also detected the fireball in [[Havdrup]], Denmark, using a [[chart recorder|pen recorder]] connected to a [[receiver (radio)|radio receiver]] for 78&nbsp;seconds, at 03:27:24<U+00B1>6 UT.<ref name="time" group="note"/><ref name="WGN Letters"/>

== Encounter data ==
The [[Earth-grazing fireball|meteoroid grazed]] Earth's atmosphere quite gently (in comparison to, for example, the 1972&nbsp;Great Daylight Fireball above the United States and Canada). It became visible at a height of 103.7&nbsp;km south of [[Zl<U+00ED>n]], Czechoslovakia, only approached Earth's surface to 98.67&nbsp;km{{#tag:ref|That is just below the [[K<U+00E1>rm<U+00E1>n line]], lying at the height of 100&nbsp;km and considered to be the boundary of Earth's atmosphere.<ref name="FAI"/>|group="note"|name="K<U+00E1>rm<U+00E1>n"}} northeast of [[Wroc<U+0142>aw]], Poland, and disappeared from the sight of the cameras at a height of 100.4&nbsp;km north of [[Pozna<U+0144>]], Poland. It would probably still have been visible until it reached a height of 110&nbsp;km above the southern [[Baltic Sea]].<ref name="AA"/>

The meteoroid's [[absolute magnitude#Meteors|absolute magnitude]] (the [[apparent magnitude]] it would have at an altitude of 100&nbsp;km at the observer's zenith) was approximately&nbsp;<U+2212>6 and did not vary significantly during the encounter. It travelled a distance of 409&nbsp;km in 9.8&nbsp;seconds during the time it was observed. It was moving with a speed of 41.74&nbsp;km/s,<ref group="note" name="velocity"/> which did not change during the flight.<ref name="Spurny"/> Ji<U+0159><U+00ED> Borovi<U+010D>ka and Zden<U+011B>k Ceplecha from the [[Ond<U+0159>ejov Observatory]] in Czechoslovakia estimated that the deceleration caused by the [[friction]] of the atmosphere was only 1.7&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> near the fireball's [[perigee]] (closest approach to Earth), which meant that its velocity was reduced by only 0.012 km/s.<ref name="AA"/> This corresponds well with [[computer simulation]]s provided by D.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Olson, R.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;Doescher and K.&nbsp;M. Watson at the [[Southwest Texas State University]], who concluded that the meteoroid was practically not decelerated along its trajectory, with the exception of a very short time near perigee, when the deceleration was 1&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="Olson"/>

The software also calculated the fireball's instantaneous apparent magnitude at the ground. The computation started and ended with heights of approximately 250&nbsp;km, long before and after the cameras of the European Fireball Network could observe it. Its apparent magnitude started at a value of +5.7 and it became brighter quite quickly. The program gave an apparent magnitude of <U+2212>5.7 when it was seen by one camera and <U+2212>6.3 at perigee. The fireball subsequently dimmed, with an apparent magnitude of <U+2212>5.4 when it was last seen by the cameras and a final calculated value of +6.0 at a height of 257&nbsp;km. However, these values are not entirely certain, because the program worked with the simplified assumption that the [[luminous efficacy]] of the fireball did not change along the track.<ref name="Olson"/> The starting apparent magnitude is not far from the [[naked eye]] visibility limits. For example, faint [[star]]s of the magnitude +6 can can be observed only in dark rural areas approximately 150&nbsp;km far from big cities. For comparison, this magnitude corresponds to the apparent magnitude of [[Uranus]].<ref name="Comet Quarterly"/> At its brightest, it was several times as bright as the maximum brightness of [[Venus]].

== Physical characteristics ==
The meteoroid was a type&nbsp;I fireball,<ref name="AA"/> i.e. an [[ordinary chondrite]].<ref name="FAQ"/> When it entered Earth's atmosphere its mass was about 44&nbsp;kg, which was estimated on the basis of the measured values of its absolute magnitude and velocity. It lost approximately 350&nbsp;g during the encounter.<ref name="AA"/> Computer simulations showed that it started losing mass approximately at the moment it became visible to the cameras of the European Fireball Network, at a height of 100.6 km. It lost mass for 25 seconds, until it reached a height of 215.7&nbsp;km.<ref name="Olson"/> Its surface melted and solidified again after leaving,<ref name="AA"/> which means its surface became a typical [[Meteorite|meteoritic]] [[fusion crust]].<ref name="WGN"/>

The meteoroid was not dangerous to the life on Earth. Even if it were heading towards Earth's surface, the flight through the atmosphere would probably have heated it so much that it would have exploded high above the ground and only some small particles ([[meteorite]]s) might have made it to Earth's surface.<ref name="Australian Museum"/>

== Orbit ==
[[File:EN131090 with text.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Orbit of the meteoroid before and after grazing Earth's atmosphere]]
Because the fireball was recorded by two cameras of the European Fireball Network, it was possible to calculate the trajectory of its flight through the atmosphere, and afterward also the characteristics of both its pre- and post-encounter [[orbit]] in the Solar System.<ref name="AA"/> The calculations were published by Czech astromers Pavel Spurn<U+00FD>, Zden<U+011B>k Ceplecha, and Ji<U+0159><U+00ED> Borovi<U+010D>ka from [[Ond<U+0159>ejov Observatory]],<ref name="WGN"/><ref name="AA"/><ref name="Spurny"/> who specialize in meteor observations. They proved that the encounter changed the meteoroid's orbit significantly. For example, its [[perihelion and aphelion|aphelion]] (the farthest it travels from the [[Sun]]) and [[orbital period]] were lowered to almost half of their original values.<ref name="Spurny"/>
