==History and background==
The Baltic Sea coast has been a source of [[Eurasia]]n amber trade since prehistoric times (see [[Amber Road]]). [[Neolithic]] artifacts made of amber were discovered in nearby [[Juodkrant<U+0117>]] in the 19th century - these artifacts unfortunately disappeared during the [[20th century]].<ref name=Garden/> [[Lithuanian mythology]], folklore, and art have long associations with amber; the legend of [[J<U+016B>rat<U+0117> and Kastytis]] imagines an undersea palace of amber under the Baltic, which was shattered by [[Perk<U+016B>nas]], the god of thunder. Its fragments were said to be the source of the amber that still washes up on the beaches nearby.<ref name=Antanas/>

Amber workshops appeared in Palanga during the [[17th century]]; [[guild]]s devoted to the material functioned in [[Bruges|Br<U+00FC>gge]], [[L<U+00FC>beck]], [[Gda<U+0144>sk|Danzig]], and [[K<U+00F6>nigsberg]]. By the end of the [[18th century]] Palanga was the center of the [[Russian Empire]]'s amber industry. In the years preceding [[World War I]] about 2,000 [[kilogram]]s of raw amber were processed in Palanga annually.<ref name=Antanas/> 

In 1897 Feliks [[Tyszkiewicz]] (Lithuanian: Ti<U+0161>kevi<U+010D>ius), a member of an old [[Ruthenia]]n/[[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] noble family that had long had a presence in Palanga, built the [[Neo-Renaissance]]-style palace that now houses the museum.<ref>Gediminas Gri<U+0161>kevi<U+010D>ius.

The exhibition areas open to the public include 15 rooms covering about 750 [[square metre|square meters]]; a chapel connected to the palace houses temporary exhibitions. The museum is thematically divided into the scientific and cultural/artistic aspects of amber.<ref name=Antanas>Palangos gintaro muziejus.

The first floor is dedicated to displays that illustrate the formation and composition of amber. Amber in the area arose from [[river delta|deltaic]] deposits of rivers flowing from [[Fennoscandia]] in the [[Eocene]] Period, about 40 to 45 million years ago.<ref name=Antanas/> The processes via which [[resin]] is changed into amber by microorganisms, [[oxidation]], and [[polymerization]] are illustrated. Samples of microdrops and microicicles (i.e. "amber within amber") are among the displayed items. The museum holds the third largest amber specimen in [[Europe]], the "Sun Stone", weighing over 3.5 kilograms, which has been stolen twice.<ref>Vakar<U+0173> ekspresas.
