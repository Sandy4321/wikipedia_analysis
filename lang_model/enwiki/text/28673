'''''Animal''''' is the debut [[studio album]] by American pop singer [[Kesha]]. The album was released on January 1, 2010, by [[RCA Records]]. Kesha worked with a variety of producers and writers such as [[Dr. Luke]], [[Benny Blanco]], [[David Gamson]], [[Greg Kurstin]], [[Max Martin]], and others. Lyrically, the majority of the album's songs are based on Kesha's past life experiences of love, heartbreak, boys, and having a good time. Musically, ''Animal'' draws from the [[dance-pop]] genre, while incorporating elements of [[Electro music|electro]] and [[electropop]] in its production and beats.

The album received mixed reviews from music critics. Some appreciated its fun, carefree nature, while others dismissed it as juvenile and said that it seemed insincere. The use of [[Auto-Tune]] on the album to alter Kesha's voice was called fun by some critics, while others found it irritating and said it made it difficult to tell if Kesha could actually sing. The album attained chart success, debuting at number one in Canada, the United States, and Greece, while charting within the top ten in seven other countries. Worldwide, the album has sold two million copies.

Four singles have been released from the album. Its lead single, "[[Tik Tok (song)|Tik Tok]]", was released on August 7, 2009 and was a worldwide hit, reaching number one in eleven countries. It reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and stayed at the top for nine consecutive weeks. The album's second and third singles, "[[Blah Blah Blah (song)|Blah Blah Blah]]" and "[[Your Love Is My Drug]]", achieved similar success both reaching the top ten in multiple countries. "[[Take It Off (song)|Take It Off]]" was released as the album's fourth and final single. The song reached the top ten in three countries and the top twenty in five more.

{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="The first is a gorgeously sung, self-penned country ballad that hints at what could've been had Kesha pursued a different path. The other is a gobsmackingly awful trip-hop track. But at one point toward the end, Kesha runs out of lyrics and starts rapping, for a full minute or so: 'I'm a white girl/From the 'Ville/Nashville, bitch. Uhh. Uhhhhh.'
'That's when I was like, OK, I like this girl's personality. When you're listening to 100 CDs, that kind of bravado and chutzpah stand out."<ref name=cover/>|source=<U+2014>''Billboard'' and Dr. Luke, on Kesha's demo and eventual signing}}

Kesha had been recording demos for several years, when one of her demos ended up in the hands of Samantha Cox, senior director of writer/publisher relations at [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]]. Cox, who had worked with Kesha before, passed along the demos to a friend at BMI, who passed it to the manager of Lukasz Gottwald, known as [[Dr. Luke]]. At the age of eighteen, Kesha signed to Dr. Luke's label, Kemosabe Records, and his publishing company, Prescription Songs. Luke was busy with other projects at the time, and Kesha ultimately wound up signed to [[David Sonenberg]]'s management company, DAS. While at DAS she worked with several top writers and producers, but rarely worked with or even spoke to Luke. During a co-writing session with [[Greg Wells]]at DAS,  Kesha developed her beat-driven sound.<ref name=cover>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/news/ke-ha-the-billboard-cover-story-1004069106.story|first=Bill|last=Werde|title=Ke$ha: The Billboard Cover Story|date=2010-02-19|accessdate=2010-02-28|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]}}</ref> DAS searched for a label deal for Kesha despite her still being in a signed contract with Luke. Kara DioGuardi, an [[artists and repertoire]] (A&R) representative for Warner, was also interested in signing Kesha but the deal never went through because of the outstanding contract with Luke. Shortly after, Kesha and DAS parted ways and Kesha wound up reunited with Luke.<ref name=cover/> At the end of 2008, Luke was working on a track with [[Flo-Rida]] called "[[Right Round]]", and the two decided they needed a female [[Hook (music)|hook]]. Luke decided to have Kesha perform on the song and within two months, it was a number one hit in multiple countries around the world. The event led to Kesha being sought after by many major labels,<ref name=cover/> and she eventually signed a multi-album deal with [[RCA Records]].<ref name=ft>{{cite web|url=http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/how-to-create-a-chart-topper-ftimes-68726b825be6.html|title=How to create a chart-topper|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=2010-04-21|first=Andrew|last=Edgecliffe-Johnson|date=2010-03-24}}</ref> Kesha explained that she chose to sign with the company due to how well she got along with RCA A&R executive Rani Hancock, explaining that "Rani doesn't ever try to censor me, [...] and I like being surrounded by strong, intelligent women."<ref name=cover/>

==Background and inspiration==
{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="''Animal'', the name of the record, it's kind of my steez [style], I have to say.

Society has taught us to suppress certain things and not do certain things."<ref name=RS/>|source=<U+2014>Kesha, on the inspiration on the album title}}
Kesha had been working on ''Animal'' for seven years prior to its release, and had written over 200 songs for the album.<ref name="Meet">{{cite web|url=http://www.seventeen.com/fun-stuff/17-buzz/kesha-interview|title=Meet "Tik Tok" Singer Ke$ha|date=2010-01-11|work=[[Seventeen (magazine)|Seventeen]]|publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc|accessdate=2010-01-16}}</ref> The abundance of material extended it from its originally planned twelve tracks to fourteen.<ref name="Meet"/> Kesha felt that the album had an empowering, carefree message for young women. "For girls, I think it's an empowering record, it's funny, it's cheeky," she said. "I think people need to have fun with whatever they're doing<U+2014>makeup, their clothes, music, live shows<U+2014>anything you don't need to take too seriously, don't take too seriously."<ref name="Meet"/> When asked how the album related to her life, Kesha explained that the album was completely autobiographical. "I just write about what I live<U+2014>literally, [...] I think there's a great pop song in anything and everything, any situation."<ref name=RS>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/14639/81133|title=Party Animal: Behind Ke$ha's Big Debut|last=Scaggs|first= Austin|date=2010-01-26|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2010-07-03}}</ref> She cites her songs "Stephen" and "Dinosaur" as examples of this. She explained: "it's about this guy I've been stalking since I was 15. I wrote the song when I was 16 with my mom, and I was like, "This song's so dope, I know it is". "Dinosaur" came "about [when] this old guy who was hitting on me, and his toupee was kind of falling off, and I was like, "Oh my God, you're so old, you're prehistoric, you're like a dinosaur. D-I-N-O-S-A-you are a dinosaur."<ref name=RS/> Explaining the reasoning behind the title track being placed at the end of the album's tracklist, Kesha said:
<blockquote>"I believe, sonically, the next record might be going. Me and my brother had a silly punk band before, and I loved pop music and I liked catchy music, but I think I also am possessed to be what some critics might deem as silly pop music. I think I have more shit to offer, so I think that "Animal" is a nice segue into the next record, hopefully."<ref name=RS/></blockquote>

Monica Herrera of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' commented that the prevalent use of [[Auto-Tune]] on Kesha's vocals made it difficult to tell if she could actually sing, citing the song "Take It Off" as an example of "how easily individuality can get lost in a sea of Auto-Tune".
