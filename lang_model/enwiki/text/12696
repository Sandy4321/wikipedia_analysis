'''Baxter Clock''' is a historic [[street clock]] located in [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]], [[North Carolina]].  It was manufactured around 1920 by the [[Seth Thomas Clock Company]], and erected in 1930 opposite the front entrance of Baxter's Jewelry Store.  The four-sided clock has brass and steel works contained in a spherical [[cast iron]] case which consists of three stages.  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP) in 1973, but in 1977, an accident resulted in the broken clock being placed in storage for almost fourteen years.  The Baxter Clock is thought to be one of three operating clocks of its kind remaining in the country.<ref name=barefoot>{{cite book | author= Barefoot, Daniel W. | title=Touring the Backroads of North Carolina's Lower Coast | location=Winston-Salem | publisher= John F.

==History==
Street clocks were installed in many American cities from the 1860s to early-20th century, with the two largest manufacturers on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] being the Seth Thomas Clock Company and the [[E. Howard & Co.|E. Howard Clock & Watch Company]].  The Baxter Clock stands in front of 323 Pollock Street, a [[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Dutch Revival]] style property built in 1918 that was the longtime home of the Baxter's Jewelry Store and currently home to the Fine Art at Baxters gallery.<ref name=baxter>{{cite news | date=September 25, 2013 | title=New Bern ArtWorks & Company Changes Name to 'Fine Art at Baxters' | url=http://www.newbernsj.com/news/arts-entertainment/new-bern-artworks-company-changes-name-to-fine-art-at-baxters-1.208432 | newspaper=Sun Journal | accessdate=November 14, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=nrhp>{{cite web | url=http://www.hpo.ncdcr.gov/nr/CV0002.pdf | title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form | author=Survey Planning Unit Staff | date=September 2, 1972 | publisher=North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office | accessdate=November 14, 2014 }}</ref>  It was manufactured by the Seth Thomas Clock Company of [[Thomaston, Connecticut|Thomaston]], [[Connecticut]].  The clock was built in 1920, but features a style and design similar to ones made in the late-19th century.  Baxter's Jewelry Store, previously located on Middle Street, moved to Pollock Street around 1920, but didn't have the clock installed until 1930.<ref name=nrhp/>  It was listed on the NRHP on July 2, 1973.<ref name=nris/>  The clock was also designated a [[contributing property]] to the [[New Bern Historic District]], which was listed on the NRHP on June 19, 1973.<ref name=district>{{cite web | url=http://www.hpo.ncdcr.gov/nr/CV0028.pdf | title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form | author=Survey Planning Unit Staff | date=May 23, 1973 | publisher=North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office | accessdate=November 14, 2014 }}</ref>

On May 5, 1977, a furniture truck backed into the clock, damaging the pedestal.  Benny and Della Baxter hired a salvage company the following day to use a crane to lift the clock from the pedestal so it could be repaired.  During the procedure, the clock was accidentally dropped causing it to smash into pieces on the sidewalk.  The cast iron casing of the clock was relatively unscathed, but much of the workings was heavily damaged.  The accident shocked the Baxters and residents of New Bern.  Dabney Coddington, then a curator at [[Tryon Palace]], said "That block of Pollock Street really looks naked, believe me."  The Baxters attempted to repair or replace the clock, but were unsuccessful.  The surviving pedestal was all that remained on the street for the next fourteen years while the broken pieces were stored in the basement of the jewelry store.  In 1990, the non-profit Swiss Bear Downtown Development Corporation wanted to see if it was possible to restore the clock.  Swiss Bear was granted ownership of the clock by the Baxter family on the condition it was restored.  Swiss Bear in turn told city leaders the organization would help restore the clock if the city took over ownership and maintenance costs following the restoration.  A Swiss Bear representative contacted the clock manufacturer [[The Verdin Company|Verdin Company]] of [[Ohio]] which had the original patterns of the clock case.  Swiss Bear began the Baxter Clock Restoration Campaign which raised the necessary $28,000 needed for repairs.  The repaired clock was dedicated on April 20, 1991, with special guest Patricia Dorsey, Secretary of the [[North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources]], in attendance.<ref name=susan>{{cite news | last=Moffat-Thomas | first=Susan | date=November 2, 2013 | title=Swiss Bear: The Baxter Four-faced Street Clock <U+2014> a new lease on life | url=http://www.newbernsj.com/news/local/swiss-bear-the-baxter-four-faced-street-clock-a-new-lease-on-life-1.229285 | newspaper=Sun Journal | accessdate=November 14, 2014 }}</ref>  The clock is believed to be the only one of its kind remaining in North Carolina.<ref name=nrhp/> 

==Design==
Baxter Clock is approximately {{convert|20|ft|sp=uk}} tall and is illuminated at night.  The clock is supported by a slim column on top of a tall pedestal while metal supports extending {{convert|10|ft|sp=uk}} below the ground act as an anchor.  The pedestal is painted black while the clock and column are brown.  The pedestal features three vertical square panels, each covered with [[Fluting (architecture)|fluting]], on all four sides.  The top of each pedestal face includes the imprinting, "Seth Thomas", the clock manufacturer.  Behind the panels on the north and south sides are doors with an iron knob allowing access to the [[clockwork]].  The clockwork inside the pedestal is an iron weight pulled down two iron rods by gravity.  When this occurs, a steel and copper [[pendulum]] is swung, which in turn moves the hands of a small clock located behind the pendulum.  The face of this clock is inscribed with the text "Seth Thomas, No. 2139, July 24, 1920".  The interior clock regulates the four exterior faces of the clock.<ref name=nrhp/>

The pedestal and column are separated by two stepped stages.  The fluted column features a molded base and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] style [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] decorated with fern [[palmette]]s.  The top of the clock was cast as four separate sections.  There are visible seams on each corner of the clock as well as decorative lion heads surrounded by a palmette border.  Each lion has an iron ring in its mouth.  Each face of the clock measures over {{convert|3|ft|sp=uk}} in diameter and is protected by a glass cover.  The time is indicated by hour, minute, and second hands made of iron, with black capital Roman numerals (hour), black squares (minutes), triangles (hour divisions), and [[Lozenge|diamonds]] (three hour intervals).  The north and south faces feature black lettering reading "BAXTER THE JEWELER" while the east and west faces including the lettering "DR. J. O. BAXTER EYESIGHT SPECIALIST".  The top portion of the clock includes [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] [[crocket]]s above each face and a three-tiered [[finial]].  The finial is decorated with twisted fluting and leaf molding.<ref name=nrhp/>
