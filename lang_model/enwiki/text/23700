'''James Dalton Bell''' (born 1958) is an [[United States|American]] [[crypto-anarchist]] who created the idea of arranging for anonymously-sponsored assassination payments via the Internet, which he called "[[assassination politics]]".<ref name=recant>{{cite news |url=http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2000/04/35620 |title=Crypto-Convict Won't Recant |accessdate=2007-11-07 |date=[[2000-11-11]] |last=McCullagh |first=Declan |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref> Bell was targeted and identified by the [[Federal government of the United States]] as a "techno-[[terrorist]]", leading to his trial and imprisonment on [[felony]] charges in 1997.<ref name=recant/> Bell was hailed by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' in 2001 as "[o]ne of the Internet's most famous essayists"<ref name=gaydeath>{{cite news |first=Declan |last=McCullagh |title=Gay Site Halts Death 'Advice' |url=http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2001/12/48779 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=[[2001-12-01]] |accessdate=2008-01-14 }}</ref> and "the world's most notorious crypto-convict".<ref name=supremacy>{{cite news |first=Declan |last=McCullagh |title=Assassinate this |url=http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2001/06/44567|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=[[2001-04-06]] |accessdate=2008-01-14 }}</ref>

In 1996, Bell authored a notorious crypto-anarchist essay called "Assassination Politics", which detailed an elaborate [[assassination market]] in which anonymous benefactors could securely order hits of government officials. Following an investigation by the [[Internal Revenue Service]], he was arrested and subsequently jailed for 11 months on [[felony]] charges of harassment and using fraudulent [[Social Security number]]s. While he was serving his sentence, two of Bell's acolytes succeeded in partially implementing his assassination market scheme and were too swiftly charged and jailed. After his release, Bell was subjected to heavy surveillance and was rearrested for harassment and stalking of federal agents, charged with intimidation and stalking and again imprisoned, this time for a decade-long sentence. Bell protested vociferously against the conduct of the trial, going so far as to file [[civil lawsuit]]s against two judges, at least two prosecutors, his former probation officers and his defense attorneys, but ultimately to no avail.

== Background ==
Bell was born in [[Akron, Ohio]] and attended the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where he earned a degree in [[chemistry]].<ref name=freedefense/> After graduation, he worked for [[Intel]] before founding his own [[computer storage device]] company, SemiDisk Systems, in 1982.<ref name=freedefense/><ref name=destroyed>{{cite news |url=http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2002/05/52781|title=Busy Year for Big Brother |accessdate=2008-01-14 |date=[[2002-05-25]] |last=McCullagh |first=Declan |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref> He was arrested in 1989 for illegally manufacturing [[methamphetamine]], but pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of failing to report receiving a controlled chemical,<ref name=kaplan/><ref name=judge/> for which he paid a fine of [[USD|$]]2,500.<ref name=demons>Branton, John.

Accessed [[2008-01-14]]</ref> When his company closed in 1992, Bell claimed to have developed a "[[phobia]]" of [[tax]]-related issues and became a [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] member, describing his political beliefs as [[anarchism|anarcho]]-[[libertarian]].<ref name=freedefense/> He involved himself with the [[militia movement]] and with the Multnomah County Common Law Court in [[Portland]], which put government officials on trial ''[[in absentia]]'' and awarded judgements against them.<ref name=demons/><ref name=judge/> Bell subsequently became involved in a tax dispute with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] who adjudged that he owed [[USD|$]]30,000 to the federal government.<ref name=kaplan>[[David Kaplan (author)|Kaplan, David E.]], "[http://jya.com/next-wave.htm Terrorism's next wave]", [[U.S. News|''U.S. News'' Online]], November 17, 1997</ref>

== "Assassination Politics" ==
[[Image:Bob murphy.jpg|thumb|Economist [[Robert P. Murphy|Bob Murphy]], [[anarcho-capitalist]] critic of Bell's assassination politics.]]
In 1996, Bell authored an essay entitled "Assassination Politics" in which he developed the idea of using [[digital signatures]] on [[electronic mail]] to create an [[assassination market]], "predicting" the deaths of IRS agents and other government employees. In effect, the idea would create an [[incentive]] for assassination of these agents, creating a "prize" that could be "won" by someone willing to submit an entry "predicting" a given agent's death at a particular time. The person could then kill the agent at about that time, thus winning the pool money.<ref name=assassin>Bell, James Dalton. 1996. "Assassination Politics." In Winn Schwartau ed., ''Information Warfare'' (2nd ed., pp.420<U+2013>425. [[New York]]: Thunder's Mouth Press.</ref> The purpose was to intimidate the IRS agents and others into no longer enforcing tax rulings and tax and other laws. Bell published his idea in a ten-part essay titled "Assassination Politics" on the alt.anarchism [[USENET]] newsgroup.

Described by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' as "an unholy mix of [[encryption]], [[anonymity]], and [[digital cash]] to bring about the ultimate annihilation of all forms of government", the essay garnered a [[Chrysler Award for Innovation in Design]] in 1998 as "an imaginative and sophisticated prospective for improving governmental accountability".<ref name=recant/> While the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has ruled that advocating violence against government officials is protected by the [[First Amendment]], realistic threats can be punished,<ref name=stamper/> and "Assassination Politics" put Bell under the scrutiny of federal investigators in late 1996. The essay continued to attract interest from anarchist theorists long after its author's legal entanglements; [[Libertarian]] economist [[Robert P. Murphy|Bob Murphy]] criticised the assassination politics scheme in a pair of articles titled "The Politics of Destruction" in 2002.<ref name=murph>{{cite web | authorlink=Robert P.

''[[True Names|True Names: And the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier]]'' (2001), Tor Books, p.44</ref>).

== Investigation, prosecution and imprisonment ==
In February 1997 the [[Internal Revenue Service]] acted on Bell's debt, docking his wages and seizing his 10-year old automobile.<ref name=kaplan/> Inside the car, investigators found bomb-making instructions, radical political literature and detailed information concerning [[cyanide]] and [[fertilizer]], the latter of which was a key ingredient in the [[Oklahoma City bombings]], a militia-linked atrocity perpetrated in 1995.<ref name=kaplan/> At the time, lack of evidence that Bell intended to harm anyone prevented investigators from bringing charges, but when, four weeks later, he [[stinkbomb]]ed their Vancouver offices with a [[propanethiol]]-soaked [[welcome mat]], the IRS resolved to act in fear that Bell might escalate his actions.<ref name=kaplan/>

IRS officers raided Bell's parents home on [[April Fool's Day]], 1997 and seized three [[semi-automatic]] [[assault rifle]]s, a [[handgun]], several computers containing indecipherable [[public-key cryptography|encrypted]] data, as well as dangerous chemicals including [[sodium cyanide]] and an alleged [[nerve-gas]] precursor<ref name=judge/> (Bell had previously boasted of producing [[sarin]] of the type used in the 1995 [[Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway|attack on the Tokyo subway]] ).<ref name=kaplan/> He was subsequently arrested in May of that year,<ref name=sentence>"[http://jya.com/jimbell6.htm Activist Bell Faces Sentencing Friday]", ''[[The Columbian]]'', [[1997-11-20]], Section B.</ref> and in July pleaded guilty to charges of obstruction of IRS agents and the use of a false [[Social Security]] number (officials alleged that he had used four such numbers since 1984 in order to conceal his assets<ref name=fibers>Branton, John.

Accessed [[2008-01-14]]</ref>).

During the trial, the government's lead investigator compared Bell with Oklahoma City bomber [[Timothy McVeigh]] and [[anarcho-primitivist|anarcho-primitivist]] bomber [[Theodore Kaczynski]].<ref name=judge/> As part of his [[plea bargain]], Bell pled guilty in July 2007 to collecting the names and home addresses of IRS employees,<ref name=judge>"[http://jya.com/jimbell6.htm Judge Delays Bell's Sentencing]", ''[[The Columbian]]'', [[1997-11-21]], Section A</ref> and the home addresses of [[FBI]], [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] agents and police in [[Clark County]];<ref name=tacoma/> Bell also accepted responsibility for conducting the stinkbomb attack in the Vancouver IRS office and for the assassination market scheme.<ref name=kaplan/> He was convicted of the two low-level [[felony|felonies]]<ref name=tacoma>Painter Jr., John.

==Acolytes==

Although Bell never attempted to put the assassination market concept into practice, other subscribers to the Cypherpunks mailing list developed the protocols to implement it online. Itinerant musician Carl Edward Johnson developed Dead Lucky, an "assassination bot" which promised to reward accurate dead pool predictions with untraceable and untaxable cash.<ref name=stamper>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Stamper |title=Guilty Verdict for Cypherpunk |url=http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,19239,00.html |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=[[1999-04-20]] |accessdate=2008-01-14 }}</ref> Federal investigators issued a warrant for Johnson's arrest in August 1998.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ludlow | first = Peter | title = Crypto Anarchy, Cyberstates, and Pirate Utopias | publisher = MIT | location = Cambridge | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780262621519 }}</ref> In spite of government attempts to link Johnson's case to his, then-incarcerated Bell asserted that Johnson was not a close friend, but "more of a vague Internet acquaintance than anything else".<ref name=stamper/>
