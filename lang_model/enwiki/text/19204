She was the seventh of eight children and received a primary education in the village school before teaching in [[Cobourg]] for two years.<ref>Bouchard, S. & Verdon, R (2009) [http: //www.radio-canada.ca/radio/profondeur/RemarquablesOublies/mhubbard.html Mina Hubbard: Remarkable forgotten] Retrieved December 2009 <!-- from French Wikipedia article --></ref>.

In 1900 she nursed the journalist [[Leonidas Hubbard]] whilst he was hospitalized with [[typhus]]. They married on 31 January 1901.

==Expedition==
Following her husband's [[Leonidas Hubbard#Ill-fated expedition|ill-fated expedition]] Hubbard asked the surviving member of the party, [[Dillon Wallace]], to record the experience as a memorial to her husband. His published book, ''Lure of the Labrador Wild'' was a commercial success in America, but Hubbard was not satisfied, coming to believe that Wallace was responsible for the death of her husband, and that her husband's name had been blemished by Wallace's book.<ref name=Lob>Richard Clarke Davis (Ed) (1996) ''Lobsticks and Stone Cairns: Human Landmarks in the Arctic'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CKisKFb0YKYC&lpg=SL17-PA286&dq=mina%20benson%20hubbard&pg=PA292#v=onepage&q=mina%20benson%20hubbard&f=false page 292] University of Calgary Press ISBN 1895176883 Retrieved February 2015</ref>

In 1905, whilst Wallace was planning to complete the expedition of 1903, Hubbard put together a team of her own in a bid to clear her husband's name.<ref name=Lob/> Consisting of the same George Elson who had been on the earlier expedition, along with two Cree Indians who had taken part in the unsuccessful rescue attempt in 1903, Hubbards team left [[Northwest River]] on June 27th,<ref name=Nast/> the same day as the Wallace expedition.<ref name=Nast/> 

The 576 mile trip was an efficient, well organised trek through the wilderness, completed on schedule,<ref name=Lob/> despite weather delays at the beginning of August when they reached the watershed at [[Lake Michikamau]].<ref name=Nast/> The expedition arrived at the [[George River (Quebec)|George River]] post on [[Ungava Bay]] on 29th August,<ref>Richard Clarke Davis (Ed) (1996) ''Lobsticks and Stone Cairns: Human Landmarks in the Arctic'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CKisKFb0YKYC&lpg=SL17-PA286&dq=mina%20benson%20hubbard&pg=SL17-PA287#v=onepage&q=mina%20benson%20hubbard&f=false page 286-288] University of Calgary Press ISBN 1895176883 Retrieved February 2015</ref> some seven weeks before Wallace arrived.<ref>Wendy Roy (2005) ''Maps of Difference: Canada, Women, and Travel'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9uWXV2LCFtkC&lpg=PA84&dq=mina%20benson%20hubbard&pg=PA91#v=onepage&q=mina%20benson%20hubbard&f=false page 91] McGill-Queen's Press ISBN 0773528660 Retrieved February 2015</ref>

In 43 days of travelling, the Hubbard expedition confirmed that the Nascaupee, Seal Lake and Lake Michikamau were in the same drainage basin, and that the Northwest River and the Nascaupee were in fact the same. In addition, Hubbard made extensive notes on the topography, geology, flora and fauna of this unknown wilderness.<ref name=Nast/> 

She named the source of the George River, [[Lake Hubbard]] after her husband.<ref>Wendy Roy (2005) ''Maps of Difference: Canada, Women, and Travel'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9uWXV2LCFtkC&lpg=PA84&dq=mina%20benson%20hubbard&pg=PA94#v=onepage&q=mina%20benson%20hubbard&f=false page 94] McGill-Queen's Press ISBN 0773528660 Retrieved February 2015</ref> 

Her book, ''A Woman's Way Through Unknown Labrador'', and her diaries provide descriptions of her encounters with the [[Naskapi]] and [[Innu|Montagnais]] Indians, and of the last great herds of Labrador's [[caribou]].<ref name=Lob/>

==Later life==
After the trip Hubbard carried out a lecture tour of England, where, in 1908, she met and married [[Harold Ellis]], a British memmber of parliament. Together they had three children, but divorced in the 1920's.<ref name=Lob/> <!-- German Wikipedia states 1926. Any reference to confirm 1926 appreciated. -->

She returned to Cananda in 1936 to acompany George Elson on a canoe trip down the [[Moose River (Ontario)|Moose river]] in northern Ontario.<ref name=Lob/>

Hubbard died in [[Coulston]], United Kingdom, at the age of 86, when she was hit by a train while crossing railway tracks.<ref>Buchanan, R. & Greene, B.
