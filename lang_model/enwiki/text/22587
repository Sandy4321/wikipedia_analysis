'''''Hell Awaits''''' is the second [[studio album]] by the American [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]], released through [[Metal Blade Records]] in 1985. The band's previous release, ''[[Show No Mercy]]'', became Metal Blade Records highest selling release, which led producer [[Brian Slagel]] wish to release another album. Slagel financed a recording budget (''Show No Mercy'' was self-financed by band members) and recruited several experienced producers to help in the studio.

''Hell Awaits'' featured the band's most progressive and diverse work compared to their previous releases, having faster, thrash orientated songs, and is cited as an influence by many [[extreme metal]] bands.<ref name="Hell Awaits"/> The album had several re-issues, including bonus tracks taken from the [[EP]] ''[[Haunting the Chapel]]''.

==Recording==
Slayer's previous album ''[[Show No Mercy]]'' became [[Metal Blade Records]] highest selling release <U+2014> 40,000 copies worldwide; making producer [[Brian Slagel]] want the band to release another record.<ref name="INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN SLAGEL">{{cite web|title = INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN SLAGEL|author = German, Eric|publisher = Metalupdate.com|url = http://www.metalupdate.com/interviewmetalblade.html|accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref> Slagel hired producer [[Ron Fair]], who worked for [[Chrysalis Records]], and had seen the band perform live and enjoyed their performance. On seeing Slayer in the studio Fair stated "Wow, these guys are really angry", as he was inexperienced working with heavy metal musicians.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> Slagel financed the album, where as ''Show No Mercy'' was financed by vocalist [[Tom Araya]], using his earnings as a [[respiratory therapist]] and money borrowed from guitarist [[Kerry King]]'s father.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>

Drummer [[Dave Lombardo]] asserts the album was professionally done compared to their previous release, ''Show No Mercy'': "I didn<U+2019>t have to overdub the [[cymbals]], and we had a really good engineer."<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> Lombardo's favorite song is "At Dawn They Sleep": "because it was kind of slow and grungy, but then it had that [[double-bass]] part the middle."<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> While recording the track, neither guitarists King or [[Jeff Hanneman]] who wrote the lyrics were in the studio <U+2014> only Araya and Slagel. On reading the lyrics there was a word, which was written incorrectly, Araya sang it how it was spelled, although it's not a real word.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> 

Bernie Grundman provided [[audio mastering]], Eddy Schreyer worked on [[remastering]] and Bill Metoyer, who worked on the band's previous release, ''[[Haunting the Chapel]]'', acted as [[sound engineer]].<ref name="Hell Awaits credits">{{cite web |title=Hell Awaits credits |publisher=All Muic Guide |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:w9fqxqu5ldje~T2 |accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref> Lyrical themes on ''Hell Awaits'' included darker themes than ''Show No Mercy'', such as [[Hell]] and [[Satan]] -<ref name="Slayer - Tom Araya - January 2007">{{cite web

==Touring==
Slayer embarked on the Combat Tour with [[Venom (band)|Venom]] and [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]]. Exodus guitarist [[Gary Holt]] asserts "We immediately bonded with the Slayer guys. It was two bands of friends playing with one band of heroes, you know? We were just star-struck."<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>
Inside Venom's tour bus (the first time Slayer had been in one) the band members got [[drunk]] with Venom, while listening to ''Hell Awaits''.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer">{{cite web|title=An exclusive oral history of Slayer|publisher=Decibel Magazine|url=http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features_detail.aspx?id=4566|accessdate=2006-12-03}}</ref> 

Araya entered the bus "hammered out of his mind" according to Lombardo, saying "I gotta take a piss! Where<U+2019>s the bathroom in this thing?"<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>
Venom vocalist [[Conrad Lant|Conrad "Cronos" Lant]] said "Right here<U+2014>right here in my mouth!" Araya took him literally and urinated on his hair. Cronos got up and punched him in the face, the two blamed each other all night, and Araya continued the tour with a [[black eye]].<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>

==Reception==
Although it did not enter any charts, ''Hell Awaits'' was noted for being Slayer's most progressive recording, featuring more darker thrash orientated style, adding unusual arrangements such as varying tempos, and dissonant nuances that "Paved the way to a wholly distinctive sound all their own," according to ''[[All Music Guide]]'' reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia.<ref name="Hell Awaits"/> Rivadavia awarded the album four out of five stars, calling it an "irresistible force, but one could still make a confident point that ''Hell Awaits'' uniquely daunting compositions arguably proved just as influential to future extreme metal acts."<ref name="Hell Awaits">{{cite web |title=Hell Awaits |author=Rivadavia, by Eduardo Rivadavia |publisher=[[All Music Guide]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:clx8b5f4tsqf
