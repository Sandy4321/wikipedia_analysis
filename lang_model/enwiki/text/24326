'''Henry Paul''', born 10 February 1974 in [[Tokoroa]], New Zealand, is a [[rugby league]] player for [[Harlequins Rugby League|Harlequins RL]] in the European [[Super League (Europe)|Super League]].

Henry's position of choice is as a [[Rugby league positions#Loose-forward|loose forward]]. He can also operate in the [[Rugby league positions#Second-row forward|back row]]. He made his name as a dynamic [[Rugby league positions#Stand-off|stand off]]. 

Henry Paul has previously represented [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] in rugby league and [[England national rugby union team|England]] in rugby union.

His brother is [[Robbie Paul]], also a New Zealand international.

==Early career==
Paul started playing rugby union at the age of three with the [[Ponsonby Rugby Football Club|Ponsonby club]] and later, during his time at Rutherford High (now [[Rutherford College, Auckland|Rutherford College]]), he played [[rugby union|union]] during the week and [[rugby league|league]] at the weekends for the [[Te Atatu Roosters]]. 

==Wakefield Trinity==
In the New Zealand offseason in 1993/94 he joined [[Wakefield Trinity Wildcats|Wakefield Trinity]] in the English [[Rugby League Championship]] and was highly impressive.<ref name="PAUL MAY BE BACK FOR MORE">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/rugbyleague/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=rleague/08/02/22/RUGBYL_Super_Nightlead.html|title=Paul May Be Back For More|publisher=Sportinglife|date=2008-02-22|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref> 

==Back to New Zealand==
He returned to New Zealand for the 1994 season, playing for the [[Waitakere City Raiders]] in the new [[Lion Red Cup]]. He originally signed for the new [[Auckland Warriors]] club who were to enter the [[Australian Rugby League]] in 1995 but they released him as part of a deal that allowed [[Andy Platt]] to join Auckland from Wigan.

==Wigan==
[[Image:Paul against Leeds.jpg|160px|thumb|left|Henry Paul in action for Harlequins RL]]
{{Expand-section|date=April 2008}}
He then went on to join [[Wigan Warriors]] for the 1994-1995 season and quickly established himself in the squad. He stayed with the Club until 1998. 

==Bradford==
In September 1998, at the end of his contract he moved to [[Bradford Bulls]], whom he helped beat his former club Wigan in the [[Super League (Europe)|Super League]] Grand Final in the autumn of 2001. When he was at Bradford he set a goalkicking record for consecutive goals (35), as well as for points in a season at the club.<ref name="Paul's conversion pays dividends">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/1457257.stm|title=Paul's conversion pays dividends|publisher=BBC|date=2001-07-25|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref>

He won the [[Lance Todd Trophy]] for his performance in the 2000 [[Challenge Cup]] victory over [[Leeds Rhinos]].

==International Rugby League==
In international football he received 23 caps for [[New  Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]].<ref name="Kiwis close door on Paul return">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/international_and_australian/5009792.stm|title=Kiwis close door on Paul return|publisher=BBC|date=2006-05-23|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref> Upon his return from rugby union in 2006 he qualified for both New Zealand and [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]].<ref name="Paul stays silent on Lions talk">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/international_and_australian/4972576.stm|title=Paul stays silent on Lions talk|publisher=BBC|date=2006-05-05|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref><ref name="Paul in frame for Great Britain">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/international_and_australian/4965760.stm|title=Paul in frame for Great Britain|publisher=BBC|date=2006-05-02|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref>

==Move to Rugby Union==
Paul had previously spoken to [[NRL]] club [[Canterbury Bulldogs]] and [[Super 12]] clubs [[Auckland Blues]] and [[Waikato Chiefs]]. However, he was finally tempted away from the [[Bradford Bulls]], to play [[rugby union]] for [[Gloucester RFC|Gloucester Rugby]], by [[Tom Walkinshaw]] and [[Philippe Saint-Andr<U+00E9>]].<ref name="Bulldogs withdraw Paul offer">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/1434145.stm|title=Bulldogs withdraw Paul offer|publisher=BBC|date=2001-07-11|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref><ref name="Walker on the warpath">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/1457375.stm|title=Walker on the warpath|publisher=BBC|date=2001-07-25|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref>

He had a dream d<U+00E9>but for Gloucester scoring 28 points against [[Caerphilly RFC]]. A prolific goal kicker and a gifted runner and distributor, Henry began a four year contract at [[Gloucester RFC|Kingsholm]] in 2001 and won national squad selection after just one game for [[Gloucester RFC|Gloucester Rugby]].<ref name="Paul must wait for debut">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/1639327.stm|title=Paul must wait for debut|publisher=BBC|date=2001-11-06|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref><ref name="Paul gets England 'A' call">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/international/1791649.stm|title=Paul gets England 'A' call|publisher=BBC|date=2002-01-30|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref>

His early days at Gloucester were turbulent, compared to the unqualified domestic success that he had in later years at the club. He was even linked with a return his former club [[Bradford Bulls]], [[Widnes Vikings]] and a move to [[NRL]] club [[Canberra Raiders]] and a reunion with former coach at [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford]] [[Matthew Elliott (rugby league)|Matthew Elliott]].<ref name="Raiders hungry for Henry">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/english/1799973.stm|title=Raiders hungry for Henry|publisher=BBC|date=2002-02-04|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref><ref name="McDermott: Time to forget Henry">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/1809787.stm|title=McDermott: Time to forget Henry|publisher=BBC|date=2002-02-18|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref><ref name="Paul rejects Widnes approach">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/super_league/2776375.stm|title=Paul rejects Widnes approach|publisher=BBC|date=2003-02-18|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref>

Having experimented with being a [[Rugby union positions#15. Full back|fullback]], and [[Rugby union positions#10. Fly-half|fly-half]] he settled into the [[Rugby union positions#12. Inside centre|inside centre]] position and his long passing stood well with Gloucester's style of play. He had his best year with Gloucester Rugby in 2004 where he won the club's season ticket holders<U+2019> player of the year award and was also nominated for the Zurich Premiership player of the year award alongside [[Bruce Reihana]], [[Mark van Gisbergen]], [[Mark Robinson]] and [[Simon Shaw]].

==England international==
With his switch to [[rugby union]], he controversially decided to play for [[England national rugby union team|England]] (due to the fact he could only play for the New Zealand national side if he played in Super 12) rather than [[All Blacks|New Zealand]]. Although he was born in New Zealand, he qualified for [[England national rugby union team|England]] through his [[Liverpool|Liverpudlian]] grandfather.<ref name="Bulldogs withdraw Paul offer">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/1434145.stm|title=Bulldogs withdraw Paul offer|publisher=BBC|date=2001-07-11|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref>

He won his first [[England national rugby union team|England]] cap as a replacement against [[France national rugby union team|France]] in 2002 but has only managed to win a handful of caps since then, mostly during the 2004 [[Rugby Union Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]], coming off the bench in Rome and [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]]. He was also considered man of the match for England A against France A in March 2004 - with five penalties and a conversion, and all round play of high class.

He excelled for the [[England national rugby union team (sevens)|England Sevens]] side and was a member of the [[2002 Commonwealth Games results#Rugby Sevens|2002 Commonwealth Games]] and [[Rugby Sevens at the 2006 Commonwealth Games|2006 Commonwealth Games]] [[England at the 2006 Commonwealth Games#Rugby Sevens|squads]], winning a silver medal in 2006. He was also a member of the England A team that won the 2003 [[Churchill Cup]] in Canada and returned there again on the 2004 [[Churchill Cup]] tour.

==Harlequins RL==
[[Image:Henry Paul kicking against Leeds.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Henry Paul in action for Harlequins RL]]
On the 27 April 2006, Henry agreed a move back to [[rugby league]] joining Harlequins Rugby League. The London side beat off competition from the [[Penrith Panthers]] to secure his signature.<ref name="Paul returns to league with Quins">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/super_league/london/4951414.stm|title=Paul returns to league with Quins|publisher=BBC|date=2006-04-27|accessdate = 2008-02-19}}</ref>

His brother [[Robbie Paul]] plays rugby league for [[Salford Reds]], having played with Henry at [[Bradford Bulls]] before a spell at [[Huddersfield Giants]]. Henry faced Robbie in his first game back in Super League on 29 April 2006.

Henry Paul moved into the back-row upon his return to rugby league, where forwards are typically smaller than in [[rugby union]], and intended to retire at the end of the [[Super League XIII|2008]] season.<ref name="Paul preparing to hang up boots">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/super_league/london/7183192.stm|title=Paul preparing to hang up boots|publisher=BBC|date=2008-01-11|accessdate = 2008-02-19}}</ref><ref name="Randall pens new Harlequins deal">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/super_league/london/6947252.stm|title=Randall pens new Harlequins deal|publisher=BBC|date=2007-08-15|accessdate = 2008-02-19}}</ref>

===Man of Steel Awards controversy===
In 2007 Henry Paul appeared [[drunk]] at the [[Super League (Europe)|Super League's]] [[Man of Steel Award]]'s dinner. Paul had  slurred his acceptance speech when he received the [[Frontline Fairplay Index Award]], awarded for good behaviour on the field, on behalf of the club.<ref name="Drunk Paul in gong rap">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/rugby_league/article320577.ecehtml|title=Drunk Paul in gong rap|publisher=Sun|date=2007-10-10|accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref><ref name="Paul in trouble after appearing drunk at show">{{cite web|url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/rugbyleague/story/0,,2187341,00.html|title=Paul in trouble after appearing drunk at show|publisher=Guardian|date=2007-10-10|accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref><ref name="Paul's night of shame">{{cite web|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/sport/sportlatest/display.var.1751184.0.pauls_night_of_shame.php|title=Paul's night of shame|publisher=Telegraph and Argus|date=2007-10-10|accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref><ref name="Henry Paul's booze shame">{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/rugby/2007/10/10/henry-the-thirst-on-rampage-89520-19925785/|title=Henry Paul's booze shame|publisher=Mirror|date=2007-10-10|accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref>

Paul has since apologised for his actions.
