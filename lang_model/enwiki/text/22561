'''Soda Stereo''' were an [[Argentina | Argentine]] [[rock music | rock]] band from [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. They were a [[power trio]] made up of singer-songwriter [[Gustavo Cerati]], [[Zeta Bosio|Hector "Zeta" Bosio]] on bass, and Carlos Alberto Ficicchia ([[Charly Alberti]]) on drums. Their career spanned from 1984<U+2013>1997, and was followed up by a short comeback tour in 2007-2008. Soda Stereo began as a new wave outfit influenced by [[The Police]], [[The Specials]], [[Television (band)|Television]], [[The Cure]], [[XTC]], and Argentine rock. Their music evolved toward a heavier [[alternative rock]] sound throughout the 90<U+2019>s, eventually drawing influences from [[classic rock]], [[shoegaze]], and [[Britpop]].

Soda Stereo were the first Latin rock group to achieve success throughout the whole of [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]], where they have sold more than 7 million copies alone. They are considered to be pioneers of the [[Rock En Espa<U+00F1>ol]], Ibero-American Rock, and Latin Rock genres. The band established what would become the template for many other popular [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking]] rock music groups. Soda Stereo has topped the all time lists in much of Latin America and in their native [[Argentina]], where they set landmarks in record sales and concert attendances.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_de_Argentina |title=Rock De Argentina |author= |date= |work=| language = |publisher=wikipedia |accessdate=September 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockenlasamericas.blogspot.com/2009/10/mas-que-rock-en-espanollas-120-mejores.html |title=Mas Que Rock En Espa<U+00F1>ol: Las 120 Mejores Canciones del Rock HispanoAmericano de todo Los Tiempos (20-1) (Spanish)|author=Mercado, Jose Luis|date= |work=Rock en las Am<U+00E9>ricas | language = Spanish|publisher= |accessdate=December 8, 2007}}</ref> In 2002 Soda Stereo was awarded the Legend Prize by [[Los Premios MTV Latinoam<U+00E9>rica|MTV Latin America]], the first prize to be awarded of its kind.

==History==
===From Stereotypes to Soda Stereo (1982-1984)===

[[File:ARA Belgrano sinking.jpg|thumb|The sinking of the Argentinean Cruiser [[ARA General Belgrano|General Belgrano]] in 1982 marked the end of the [[Falklands War]]. The loss of the war caused the Argentinian dictatorship to collapse opening the door for democracy in 1983. It was at that moment that Soda Stereo was born]]

In the summer of 1982 Gustavo Cerati at 22 years of age and Hector Zeta Bosio at 23 years of age collided at [[Punta del Este]], [[Uruguay]]. Cerati with his group ''Sauvage''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lacapital.com.ar/2007/09/21/escenario/noticia_417818.shtml |title=El Comienzo y el Primer Final|author= |date= |work= | language = Spanish|publisher=La Capital |accessdate=December 8, 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and Bosio with ''The Morgan'', a band he shared with [[Sandra Baylac]], Hugo Dop, Christian Hansen, Pablo Rodriguez,([[Los Aut<U+00E9>nticos Decadentes]]), Charly Amato, Osvaldo Kaplan, and [[Andres Calamaro]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imagenanimal.com/biografia/intro/ |title=Biograph<U+00ED>a de Zeta Bosio |author= |date= |work= | language = Spanish|publisher=Imagen Animal |accessdate=December 8, 2007}}</ref> Cerati and Bosio established a friendship and a musical bond that encourage them to start playing together. Cerati first joined Bosio<U+2019>s group ''The Morgan'', then formed ''Stress'' with Charly Amato and drummer Pablo Guadalupe. He also worked on the project ''Erekto'' with [[Andres Calamaro]]. According to Cerati both projects did not meet his expectations.

At the time Carlos Ficcichia, legal name of [[Charly Alberti]] would incessantly call Cerati's house asking for Maria Laura Cerati, Gustavo<U+2019>s sister. Alberti wanted to ask her out, but she thought he was too <U+201C>pesado<U+201D> (stiff) and did not want to go out with him.<ref name="Lernoud">Lernoud, Pipo: ''Enciclopedia Rock Nacional 30 A<U+00F1>os. De la A a la Z'', page 206. Buenos Aires: Mordisco, 1996. (Spanish)</ref> In one instance when Gustavo answered the phone, they entered a lengthy conversation about music. Alberti mentioned that he was a drummer and the son of the famous [[Jazz]] drummer, [[Tito Alberti]], songwriter of a well known Argentinian children's song, <U+201C>El Elefante Trompita<U+201D> (Little Trunk Elephant).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/1998/04/18/c-02401d.htm |title=Tito Alberti: El Otro Baterista |author=Garcia, Fernando |date=April 18, 1998 |work= | language = Spanish|publisher=[[diario Clar<U+00ED>n]] |accessdate=December 8, 2007}}</ref> After hearing Alberti play, they asked him to join the band, but first he had to cut his hair.

After a few experiments (Aerosol, Side Car) the three adopted the name ''Los Estereotipos'' (The Stereotypes), referencing a song by The Specials which they passionately listened to for few months.<ref name="Estereotipos">{{cite web |url=http://www.galeon.com/eltemblor/Historia/1982.html |title=Historia de Soda Stereo: Los Estereotipos |author= |date= |work= | language = Spanish |publisher=El Gale<U+00F3>n |accessdate=December 8, 2007}}</ref> During that time period they record a demo with [[:es:Richard Coleman|Richard Coleman]] on guitars. Soda initially recruited Coleman to beef up the guitar sound but Coleman recognized that the band sounded better without him and quit in good terms, leaving the definitive trio of Gustavo Cerati, Zeta Bosio, and Charly Alberti.<ref name="Lernoud" /> The songs recorded were, <U+201C>Porque No Puedo Ser Del Jet Set?<U+201D> (Why Can<U+2019>t I be Part of the Jet Set?), <U+201C>Dime Sebastian<U+201D> (Tell Me Sebastian), and <U+201C>Debo So<U+00F1>ar<U+201D> (Must Dream) by [[:es:Ulises Butron|Ulises Butr<U+00F3>n]], in which Ulises Butr<U+00F3>n played guitars and [[:es:Daniel Melero|Daniel Melero]] played keyboards. Following that episode, the names <U+201C>Soda<U+201D> and <U+201C>Stereo<U+201D> appeared, which resulted in <U+201C>Soda Stereo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.planetasodastereo.com.ar/a2.htm |title=<U+00BF>C<U+00F3>mo Surgi<U+00F3> El Nombre De La Banda? |author= |date= |work= | language = Spanish|publisher=Planeta Stereo |accessdate=December 14, 2007}}</ref>

Regarding the meaning and use of the word <U+201C>soda:<U+201D>

<blockquote>They say that they make music with bubbles. But instead of referring to luxurious champagne bubbles, they affirm that they assume the representative ordinary and popular [[:es:Sif<U+00F3>n Drago|Sif<U+00F3>n]], or carbonated soft drinks<ref name=sif<U+00F3>n>{{cite web |url=http://www.imagenanimal.com/biografia/1984/ |title=Soda Stereo: Biograf<U+00ED>a: Estalla el sif<U+00F3>n |author= |date= |work= | language = Spanish|publisher=Imagen Animal |accessdate=December 8, 2007}}</ref></blockquote>

The first show under the name "Soda Stereo" occurred on December of [[1982]]. The occasion was [[:es:Alfredo Lois|Alfredo Lois]] birthday party. Lois was Cerati and Bosio's university classmate. He would go on to become Soda's video director as well as their visual and stylistic guru. Lois was later recognized by Cerati himself as <U+201C>the fourth Soda<U+201D>.<ref name="pepsi">{{cite web |url=http://www.terra.com.ar/canales/Pop_Rock/124/124800.htm |title=''Entrevista en el Pepsi Music Cerati: "A Veces el Rock no Quiere Crecer" |author=Feijoo, Sebastian |date=October 13, 2005 |work= | language = Spanish |publisher= |accessdate=December 8, 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In July 1983 the band made their debut at the discotheque Airport in the [[Buenos Aires]] neighborhood of [[Belgrano (Buenos Aires)|Belgrano]]. According to the band:

<blockquote>Our debut was at a fashion show at the Disco Airport, which was close to where we practiced in Buenos Aires. Nobody gave us a nod. The three of us played on a very deficient sound system. But we were happy, even though no one paid attention. We really looked like a punk group, we didn<U+2019>t know how to play and the sound was loud, even though it was just that<ref name="pepsi"/></blockquote>

Following that gig, Soda Stereo began to play the underground circuit of [[Buenos Aires]], making a name for themselves alongside other emerging bands of the time, such as ''Sumo'', ''Los Twist'', ''Los Encargados'' (with Daniel Melero), and other bands. Soda took up residency at the traditional and deteriorated Cabaret Marab<U+00FA>, located at Maip<U+00FA> 359.<ref name="Lernoud" /> In those early shows, Soda would play songs like <U+201C>H<U+00E9>roes de la Serie<U+201D> (Heroe of the series), <U+201C>La Vi Parada Alli<U+201D> (I saw her standing there), and <U+201C>Vamos a La Playa<U+201D> (Let<U+2019>s go to the beach), along with other songs that appeared on their second demo.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Lounge/6160/HISTORIA.HTM |title=Historia de Soda |author=Pe<U+00F1>a, Jose E. |date= |work= | language = Spanish |publisher= |accessdate=August 30, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Lounge/6160/HISTORIA.HTM&date=2009-10-26+16:56:59|archivedate=2009-10-26}}</ref> On one occasion at the Caf<U+00E9> Einstein, Luca Prodan approached Cerati, whom he considered <U+201C>a chetito,<ref>"A 'chetito' is a somewhat derogatory term used by Argentineans to describe someone from the upper class."</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.elbondi.com/informe/2007-01-01.2133/elinforme.php?cobertura=2133 |title= El Rock De Las Cuatro Esquinas  |author= Andisco, Pablo and B.

The band began to attract a bit of notoriety. One night they were called to a pub to substitute for the group Nylon. There began a period of constant shows which concluded at Bar Zero, a place that excluded the Porte<U+00F1>o underground, along with Caf<U+00E9> Einstein. On their third show, Horacio Martinez, a historic Argentinian rock producer and <U+201C>talent hunter<U+201D> heard them and quickly took them to record for [[CBS]]. This came to fruition in [[1984]] when Soda signed to the Rodr<U+00ED>guez Ares agency.<ref>" Argentinean producer Horacio Mart<U+00ED>nez is credited with the 'discovery' of [[Tanguito]], [[Los Gatos (band)|Los Gatos]] and [[Mauricio "Moris" Birabent|Moris]]".</ref><ref name="Lernoud" />

At the time Soda Stereo was already known as being a band that worked hard on their image and long before the recording of their first album they decided to film a [[video clip]], which they financed with their own money.<ref>[[:es:Alfredo Lois|Alfredo Lois]]</ref> was in charge of the visuals and the graphic designs featured on the fliers and posters for their live performances. It was Alfredo who decided to edit a video clip before the release of the album, something that is quite common today but totally unusual for the time. The song chosen was <U+201C>Diet<U+00E9>tico<U+201D> (Dietitian). The filming was realized with <U+201C>borrowed<U+201D> equipment from Cablevision, where [[Zeta Bosio]] worked as a production assistant.<ref name="Estereotipos" />

===First Album and Chateau Rock '85 (1984-1985)===
[[File:Several television sets.jpg|thumb| "Sobredosis de TV" was chosen as the first single for the first Soda Stereo Album ''Soda Stereo'', released on December 14, [[1984]].The video-clip for "Diet<U+00E9>tico" was aired on M<U+00FA>sica Total on [[Canal 9 (Argentina)|Canal 9]] and had a considerable impact.<ref name="Estereotipos"/>]]

Soda Stereo recorded their debut during the second half of 1984. The album was produced by [[:es:Federico Moura|Federico Moura]], vocalist for [[:es:Virus (banda argentina)|Virus]]. By that time, Moura and Cerati had developed a fruitful artistic relationship. The recording took place in the defunct studios of [[CBS]] on Paraguay street. The end result was cooler sound than of the live shows, which the bands were pleased with. The trio was aided by [[:es:Daniel Melero|Daniel Melero]] on keys and [[:es:Gonzo Palacios|Gonzo Palacios]] on sax. Both were listed as <U+201C>guest musicians,<U+201D> a practice which would become common for Soda throughout their career. Such guest musicians would be recognized by the public as the <U+201C>fourth Sodas<U+201D>.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.zonadepromesasweb.com.ar/Ver-Noticias/soda_stereo_nota_el_cuarto_soda-480/&tipo=Nota&relacion=Soda%20Stereo |title= El Cuarto Soda  |author= |date=2007 |work= | language = Spanish|publisher=Rolling Stone Argentina |accessdate=December 8, 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The attention garnered by Soda was manifested in their playing of larger and larger venues. First was <U+201C>La Esquina Del Sol<U+201D> in [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]]. <U+201C>El Recital De Los Lagos<U+201D> on the 1st and 2 December was their first multi-headlining show with top Argentinian acts .<ref>Some of the artists who played that show were: [[:es:Virus (banda argentina)|Virus]], [[Juan Carlos Baglietto]], [[:es:GIT|GIT]], [[:es:Su<U+00E9>ter (banda)|Su<U+00E9>ter]], [[:es:Miguel Mateos|Zas]], [[Los Abuelos de la Nada]], [[:es:Marilina Ross|Marilina Ross]], [[:es:Celeste Carballo|Celeste Carballo]], and [[Sandra Mihanovich]].</ref> The show was hosted by Argentinean Television personality [[:es:Juan Alberto Badia|Juan Alberto Bad<U+00ED>a]].

Soda Stereo presented their debut album at El Teatro Astros on the 14th of December 1984, it was their first show there. The stage was designed by Alfredo Lois, who for the occasion located 26 television sets in the background. The TV's were turned on and out of sync with each other - the theme of <U+201C>Sobredosis de TV<U+201D> (TV Overdose). The TV's, together with a large amount of smoke, created an unusual but captivating visual effect<ref name="rock.com.ar">{{cite web |url=http://www.rock.com.ar/bios/0/200.shtml |title= Soda Stereo |author= |date= |work=  | language = Spanish|publisher=Rock.com.ar |accessdate=December 8, 2007}}</ref>

On the 26th of January 1985 Soda played the Rock in Bali festival in Argentinian port city of [[Mar Del Plata]]. On the 17th of March they played the Festival Chateu Rock <U+2019>85 at the [[Estadio Ol<U+00ED>mpico Chateau Carreras]] in the province of Cordoba. The official biography of the band attach great importance to this appearance indicating that the band played for 15 thousand people and that they were the revelation of the festival.<ref name="oficial">{{cite web |url=http://sodastereo.com/historia/ |title= Soda Stereo: Pagina Oficial: Historia  |author= |date= |work= | language = Spanish |publisher= |accessdate=December 10, 2008}}</ref>
However, Cordoba media outlets claim that, "only half the number of people actually showed up and that Soda were hardly noticed because their first record had was just released a few months earlier.<U+201D> They also added <U+201C>[[Raul Porchetto]] was the biggest draw of the night<U+201D>.<ref name="Fernet" >{{cite web |url=http://www2.lavoz.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=142196 |title=Fernet Con Soda |author= |date= |work= | language = Spanish|publisher=Diario [[La Voz del Interior]]|accessdate=December 10, 2007}}</ref> Regardless, their presence at Chateau sparked a personal relationship between the band the youth of Cordoba, it marked the moment that the band began to take flight toward national stardom.<ref name="cordoba">{{cite web |url=http://www2.lavoz.com.ar/07/12/01/secciones/espectaculos/nota.asp?nota_id=139629|title= Tras los pasos de Soda Stereo en C<U+00F3>rdoba  |author= |date=December 7, 2001 |work= | language = Spanish|publisher= Diario [[La Voz del Interior]]|accessdate=December 8, 2007}}</ref>

The success of the band began at a very pecuiliar time, related, on the one hand with the [[Ra<U+00FA>l Alfons<U+00ED>n|return of democracy to Argentina]] (December 10, 1983), and on the other hand, with increasing notions of [[postmodernism]], particularly in the way the 80<U+2019>s youth created their role in a newly democratic society, one that had just emerged from bloody [[Dirty War|Dictatorship]] and [[Falklands War|War]].

Years later, [[Zeta Bosio]] would reflect on this juncture:

<blockquote>The democracy produced the adrenalin of something new, something was occurring, I knew I was going to make changes without knowing how. There was more air for us to make things and to wander, and we were a band of kids that wanted to make trouble. Our attention was on punk and on trying to show that there was something else that was more direct<ref name="cordoba">{{cite web |url= http://www.desdeabajoweb.com.ar/soda.htm |title= Informe Especial: Soda Stereo (Spanish) |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Desde Abajo Diario [[La Voz del Interior]]|accessdate=December 8, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071026033539/http://www.desdeabajoweb.com.ar/soda.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = October 26, 2007}}</ref></blockquote>

On the 13th of October of that year, Soda played in front of a large audience in Buenos Aires as part of the third night of the Festival of Rock and Pop Held at the [[Estadio Jos<U+00E9> Amalfitani|Jos<U+00E9> Amalfitani Stadium]] home of the soccer club [[Club Atl<U+00E9>tico V<U+00E9>lez S<U+00E1>rsfield|Velez Sarsfield]] . They shared the stage with [[INXS]], [[Nina Hagen]], [[Charly Garcia]], [[:es:Virus (banda argentina)|Virus]], and [[:es:Sumo (banda)|Sumo]], among others. By then Fabian <U+201C>V<U+00F6>n<U+201D> Quintero and Gonzo Palacios were <U+201C>stable guests.<U+201D>

===Nada Personal and Obras 1985-1986===

[[File:423744318 1448f9577f b.jpg|thumb|The Video for ''Cuando pase el temblor'' (When The Earthquake Passes) (1986), directed by [[Alfredo Lois]] was filmed at the [[Inca Empire|Incan]] ruins of [[Pucar<U+00E1> de Tilcara]], in [[Jujuy]]. Soda fused rock and [[carnavalito]] (traditional Andean music. The video was nominated as the finalist for the 12th World Festival of Video and TV in [[Acapulco]].]]

Soda<U+2019>s second <U+00E1>lbum [[:es:Nada personal (<U+00E1>lbum)|Nada Personal]] was edited on October of [[1985]]. During the summer the group toured the touristic centers of Argentina, playing in [[Mar de Plata]], [[Villa Gesell]], and [[Pinamar]]. Finalizing the tour with a consecrating concert at the Festival De la Falda in [[C<U+00F3>rdoba, Argentina|C<U+00F3>rdoba]], which featured [[Andres Calamaro]] and [[Charly Garc<U+00ED>a]] on keyboards on <U+201C>Jet Set.<U+201D>

In April the band decided to officially present the album at a concert at the [[Arena Obras Sanitarias|Estadio Obras Sanitarias]] in [[Buenos Aires]]. There they realized four historic shows with a total attendance of 20,000 spectators. Footage from the first show was edited into a long play video.,<ref>[[:es:Bobby Flores|Bobby Flores]]</ref> the noted music critic and founder of the groundbreaking Rock & Pop Radio in Buenos Aires, thus ending his chronicle of the concert, had this to say:

"We are facing the most powerful group in the country ... The best parameter to measure this presentation is that it was short, it seemed to have lasted ten minutes or so and people were left wanting more. The outpouring of the stadium was a general murmur of the songs from Soda Stereo. The rain, the traffic on [[Avenida del Libertador]] was cluttered by those entering and leaving. The last hot dog of the night and a healthy sense of well being, leave no room for existential questions. I then put my jaw back in place and went singing softly <U+201C>Estoy Azulado<U+201D> between the rain on  Libertador.<ref name="obras">{{cite web |url=http://www.zonadepromesasweb.com.ar/Ver-Noticias/soda_stereo_nota_temblor_en_obras-95/Pagina_4/&relacion=Soda%20Stereo |title=Temblor en Obras |author=Flores, Bobby |date=April 11, 1986 |work= | language = Spanish|publisher=Revista Rock & Pop |accessdate=December 8, 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>"

After these concerts records sales began to increase at an accelerated rate, quickly passing the [[Gold certification]] that they had achieved during the summer, [[platinum certification]], and finally double platinum in the following months. Without abandoning the danceable rhythms, the second LP resulted in more depth in the lyrics and a melodical maturity. The album marked the definitive consecration of Soda Stereo to the Argentenian public.

=== The Conquest of Latin America (1986-1989) ===

[[File:Vi<U+00F1>a 2006 - 2do d<U+00ED>a.JPG|thumb|In [[1986]] [[Chile|Chilean Youth]] received Soda Stereo as popular idols. The song that created this first contact was [[:es:Nada personal (canci<U+00F3>n)<U+201C>Nada|Personal<U+201D>]] (Nothing Personal) which became a radio hit. A little later in February of [[1987]] Soda a has a strong showing at the [[Vi<U+00F1>a del Mar International Song Festival]], again in Chile. This, in effect, opened the doors to the rest of Latin America.<ref name="">{{cite web |url=http://www.galeon.com/eltemblor/Historia/1986.html |title=1986: America es de Soda |author= |date= |work= |language= Spanish |publisher=El Gale<U+00F3>n |accessdate=December 8, 2007 }}</ref>]]

In 1986 Soda Stereo realized their first Latin American tour, called Signos - still touring with the Nada Personal record. The band played in [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]] [[Peru]], and [[Chile]] with considerable success. In Chile they realized four shows in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], on the 21,22,24, and 25 November, and one in [[Valpara<U+00ED>so]] on the 22nd of November of 86  In November 1986 Soda arrived in Peru for the first time and revolutionized the market. Their album sales were enormous and their three shows at the Amauta Coliseum were unforgettable.

At that time Latin Rock was not that popular with the youth of Latin America (with the exceptions of [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]) and bands were not accustomed to international tours.<ref name="Bailando">{{cite web |url= http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/radar/9-191-2002-05-12.html |title= Bailando Sobre Los Escombros de Carlos Polimeni |author=Zeiger, Claudio |date=May 12, 2002 |work= | language = Spanish |publisher= |accessdate=December 8, 2007}}</ref>

On the 10th of November of [[1986]] the band released their third album ''[[Signos]]''. ''[[Signos]]'' with its lead single [[:es:Persiana Americana|"Persiana Americana"]] (American Blinds) was a key step for Soda Stereo who by now had come under a great deal of stress due to ever increasing factors: sales expectations, external pressures, the risk of failure, and internal tensions. The band was joined in the studio by [[:es:Fabi<U+00E1>n V<U+00F6>n Quintiero|Fabi<U+00E1>n V<U+00F6>n Quintiero]] on keys, [[:es:Richard Coleman|Richard Coleman]] on guitar and [[:es:Celsa Mel Gowland|Celsa Mel Gowland]] on back up vocals. Signos became the first Argentinian Rock album to be released on Compact Disc. It was manufactured in the Netherlands and distributed throughout Latin America.<ref name="signos">{{cite web |url= http://www.zonadepromesasweb.com.ar/Soda_Stereo/Discografia/Oficiales/Signos/|title= Sitio No Oficial de Soda Stereo.

On the 3rd of December Soda made their first appearance in Ecuado. In early 1987 Soda returned to Chile, this time to the [[Vi<U+00F1>a del Mar International Song Festival]] where they won the prize <U+201C>Antorcha de Plata<U+201D> (Silver Torch). The festival was broadcasted via television to many Latin American countries, expanding the band<U+2019>s fame throughout the continent. It did not take long to transform itself into a massive unconditional adhesion which was called <U+201C>Sodamania<U+201D>.

On the 23rd of April 1987, Soda broke records for ticket sales in [[Paraguay]] with their show at the Yacht Club. Meanwhile ''[[Signos]]'' reached Platinum status in [[Argentina]], triple platinum in [[Per<U+00FA>]] and double platinum in [[Chile]].Soda<U+2019>s first show in Mexico occurred on the 4th of August in 1987 at the Magic Circus in [[Mexico City]]. Soda

The Signos tour was a milestone for Soda as they played 22 concerts in 17 cities to almost 350,000 fans, in the process opening up the idea that Latin Rock can transcend the nationalities of the bands, something that would come to fruition in the upcoming decade. With live recordings from different shows, a live album Ruido Blanco was compiled in 1987. Mixed in Barbados, it was considered by [[Rolling Stone]] (Argentina) to be one of the top 5 live albums of Argentinean Rock<ref name="top 5 live">{{cite web |url= http://my-musik.com/article3953.html |title= Top 10 Discos En Vivo Argentinos |author= |date= |work= | language = Spanish|publisher= Rolling Stone (Argentina) |accessdate=December 9, 2007}}</ref>

In late [[1988]] Soda began to work on a new album alongside Puerto Rican producer [[Carlos Alomar]]. Alomar had worked with [[David Bowie]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Simple Minds]], [[Iggy Pop]], and [[Paul McCartney]], among others. ''[[Doble Vida]]'' (Double Life) was recorded and mixed in [[New York City]]. It was the first record by an Argentinean band to be completely recorded abroad.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r101373|pure_url=yes}} |title=Doble Vida (Overview) |author=Adaime, Iv<U+00E1>n|date= |work= |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=April 1, 2007}}</ref>

The album produced four singles, "Picnic en el 4B" (Picnic in Room 4b), "En la Ciudad de la Furia" (In the City of Fury), and "Lo Que Sangra (La C<U+00FA>pula)" (That Which Bleeds (The Dome), and <U+201C>Corazon Delator<U+201D> ([[The Tell-Tale Heart|Tell-Tale Heart]]). The video for <U+201C>En La Ciudad de La Furia<U+201D> was a finalist for an [[MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Award]] in the category of best foreign video (there was no Latin MTV at the time).

After more than a year without playing in Buenos Aires, Soda showcased ''[[Doble Vida]]'' at the hockey field at Obras in front of 25,000 fans. To top of a stellar year, Soda headlined the Three Days for Democracy Festival, which took place in Buenos Aires on the intersection of Avenida del Libertador and Nueve De Julio. The show was attended by 150,000 people and Soda shared the stage with [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]] [[Fito P<U+00E1>ez]], [[Los Ratones Paranoicos]], [[:es:Man Ray (grupo)|Man Ray]], and others.

With sales of a million copies of ''[[Doble Vida]]'' under their belt, Soda began a massive tour in early [[1989]]. The tour began with 30 shows in Argentina, covering most of the country, which were attended by nearly 270,000 thousand fans. These shows were followed by a new Latin American tour (their third), which cemented a massive following in [[Mexico]].

Near the end of 1989 Soda records a new version of <U+201C>Languis<U+201D> (from ''[[Doble Vida]]'') and a new song titled <U+201C>Mundo de Quimeras<U+201D> (World of Chimeras). Both songs were released in the EP Languis (1989) along with remixes of <U+201C>En El Borde<U+201D> and <U+201C>Lo Que Sangra (La C<U+00FA>pula)<U+201D>. Following the release of Languis Soda played two sold out shows at The Palace in [[Los Angeles]], becoming the second [[Rock en Espa<U+00F1>ol]] to play in the [[United States]], following [[Miguel Mateos]].

=== The Consecration: Canci<U+00F3>n animal (1990-1991) ===

[[File:SodaStereo CancionAnimal.jpg|thumb|The album ''[[Canci<U+00F3>n Animal]]'', released in [[1990]], is considered to be one of the best albums of all time of the Latin Rock genre.]]

In early 1990 the band co-headlined a show for 32,000 people with British new wave band [[Tears for Fears]] at the [[Estadio Jos<U+00E9> Amalfitani|Jose Amalfitani Stadium]] in Buenos Aires.

Soda Stereo then traveled to Criteria Studios in [[Miami, Florida]] to begin work on their fifth album. They would enlist the help of [[:es:Daniel Melero|Daniel Melero]], [[:es:Andrea <U+00C1>lvarez|Andrea <U+00C1>lvarez]], and [[Tweety Gonz<U+00E1>lez]] (all very important figures in the Argentinian rock scene of the time.

The resulting album ''[[Canci<U+00F3>n Animal]]''(1990) is considered to be one of the best albums in the history of Latin rock. It contains their most well known song <U+201C>[[De M<U+00FA>sica Ligera]]<U+201D> (Of Light Music), as well as other classics such as <U+201C>Cancion Animal<U+201D> (Animal Song), <U+201C>Un Million de A<U+00F1>os Luz<U+201D> (A Million Light Years), <U+201C>En el Septimo Dia<U+201D> (On the Seventh Day), and <U+201C>Te Para Tres<U+201D> (Tea For Three). These songs are considered to be the band's strongest and at the same time are their most popular,.<ref name="amgca">{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r101372|pure_url=yes}} | title = ''Canci<U+00F3>n Animal'' > Overview | accessdate = 2007-01-04 | last = Adaime | first = Iv<U+00E1>n | work = [[Allmusic]] }}</ref> Overall, the album is considered as the most consistent work by the band, along with ''Signos''.<ref name="amgca" />

Their Massive Tour ''Animal'' (1990<U+2013>1991) included 30 Argentinean cities, many which had not been visited by a band with the reach of Soda Stereo. The cities visited in Argentina were:  [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]], [[Santa Fe de la Vera Cruz]], Jun<U+00ED>n, [[Clorinda, Formosa|Clorinda]], [[Puerto Iguaz<U+00FA>]], [[Trelew]], [[Neuqu<U+00E9>n]], Santa Rosa, [[Trenque Lauquen]] [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], [[C<U+00F3>rdoba, Argentina|C<U+00F3>rdoba]], [[R<U+00ED>o Cuarto, C<U+00F3>rdoba|R<U+00ED>o Cuarto]], [[Santiago del Estero]], [[San Miguel de Tucum<U+00E1>n]], [[Salta]], [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Olavarria]], [[Pergamino]]. International cities included: [[Santiago de Chile]], [[Asuncion del Paraguay]], [[Punta del Este]], [[Barquisimeto]], [[Caracas]], Valencia, [[M<U+00E9>rida, M<U+00E9>rida|M<U+00E9>rida]], San Crist<U+00F3>bal, [[Mexico City]], [[Monterrey, Mexico|Monterrey]], [[Guadalajara]], [[Mexicali]], and [[Tijuana]].

The Tour ''Animal'' finished with 14 consecutive shows at the Grand Rex Theater in [[Buenos Aires]]. With a 3,300 person capacity, this was a noticeable achievement at the time.<ref>two years later [[Sandro de Am<U+00E9>rica|Sandro]] would play 40 consecutive shows at the Grand Rex</ref> Some of the Grand Rex shows would appear on the live EP ''Rex Mix'' (1991), which included remixed versions of a new song, <U+201C>No Necesito Verte (Para Saberlo)<U+201D> (I don<U+2019>t Need to See You - To Know).

By late 1991 Soda<U+2019>s continental success brought the band to the attention of MTV News Europe who began to take notice of what was taking place in Latin America, particularly with [[Rock en Espa<U+00F1>ol]]. MTV unconditionally dedicated a whole show to Soda - a first for non English singing band.<ref name="Costa">{{cite web |url=http://aerosoda.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!162B7F502C77AB90!597.entry |title= Soda Stereo: 1982 - 2007, Me Ver<U+00E1>s Volver |author=Kon, Daniel and Robert Costa |date=Oct 10, 2007 |work= | language = Spanish|publisher= Aerosoda |accessdate=December 9, 2007}}</ref>

In May 1992 Soda embarked on a tour of Spain with shows in [[Madrid]], [[Oviedo]], [[Sevilla]], [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], and [[Barcelona]].The lackluster results of the Spanish tour, compared to the fervor they were accustomed to in Latin America, left a sour taste in their mouths. Nevertheless, it did serve as a valid experience, specifically in bringing the band back to earth. To put it bluntly: Spain was in no way a failure, but was far from the success that Soda had been used to in Latin America, in the end it was a good learning experience.<ref name="Costa" />

===The Experimentation: Dynamo (1992-1994)===

After that moment, Soda came to the realization that they were at the center of the scene. Therefore, they decided to give some space to the musical experimentation and openly propel what would be known as ''La Movida Sonica'' (The Sonic Movement). Nearing the end of 1992 Soda released their sixth studio album ''[[Dynamo (Soda Stereo album)|Dynamo]]''. ''Dynamo'' was christened with six concerts at Obras. Each show featured a different band as support, [[Babasonicos]], [[:es:Juana La Loca (banda)|Juana La Loca]], [[:es:17 caramelos|Martes Menta]] and [[:es:Tia Newton|Tia Newton]], The Sonic Movement of which [[:es:Demonios de Tasmania|Demonios de Tasmania]] and [[:es:Los Brujos|los Brujos]] would also be part of. This would be derivative of something called <U+201C>El Nuevo Rock Argentino" (The New Argentinian Rock).,<ref>[[:es:Attaque 77|Attaque 77]]</ref> [[:es:Massacre|Massacre]], and [[El Otro Yo]] were also considered part of the movement.<ref name="Perez">{{cite web |url= http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/radar/9-3960-2007-07-20.html |title= Mucho M<U+00E1>s Que Cero  |author=Perez, Martin |date=July 20, 2007 |work= | language = Spanish|publisher= |accessdate=December 10, 2007 }}</ref> The band also showcased the album in its entirety in a local talk-show, ''Fax''. This was the first [[Stereophonic sound|stereophonic]] TV transmission in Argentina.<ref name="rock.com.ar"/>

According to Gustavo Cerati, ''Dynamo'' consisted of taking ''[[Canci<U+00F3>n Animal]]'' and destroying it." Cerati explains, "It is as if we took ''[[Canci<U+00F3>n Animal]]'' and put it under water. And, a at a sonic level, we wanted to produce that, the songs had more to do with something hypnotic. The idea was to remix it, to mix it with something more dance and include something more trance in our music. I know that those who understood that record loved it and it is the same with me.<ref name="pepsi"/>

According to AllMusic ''Dynamo'',was Soda's least popular album and at the same time their most experimental work.<ref>{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r176493|pure_url=yes}} | title = ''Dynamo'' Overview | accessdate = 2007-01-04 | last = Adaime | first = Iv<U+00E1>n | work = [[Allmusic]] }}</ref> Dynamo did not sell as expected, in large part because the band decided to change record company immediately after recording it. Sony at the time, had no intentions of promoting a group that had just emigrated from BMG and BMG could not promote another foreign product.

In January of 1993 Soda began their sixth tour of [[Latin America]], visiting [[Mexico]], [[Chile]], [[Paraguay]], and [[Venezuela]]. During the middle of the tour, the trio decided to take a long rest which fueled rumors of a break up. There had been talk of dates in the [[United States]], [[Spain]] and other countries, but diverse factors during late [[1993]] and early [[1994]] forced the group to take a <U+201C>rest<U+201D> from Soda Stereo.

[[1994]] was the worst year for Soda. On the 4th of July, Zeta<U+2019>s two young sons died in an absurd transit accident in Argentina. This event would deeply affect Zeta on both a personal and professional level. By unanimous decision Soda decided to distance themselves from the myth for a while and at the same time to evaluate the possibility of a definitive separation.

During this hiatus, Gustavo released his first solo project: ''[[Amor Amarillo]]'' (Yellow Love), (ironically, Gustavo had mentioned that he had no interest in a solo career). Zeta dedicated himself to the production of other pands (Peligrosos Gorriones and Aguirre). Charly disappeared from the music scene to focus on personal projects.

At the end of 1994 ''[[Zona de Promesas]]'', a compilation of remixes and classic Soda songs, including the unreleased song that gave the album its name, was released,

=== Sue<U+00F1>o Stereo (Stereo Dream) (1995-1997)===

[[File:Sue<U+00F1>oStereo.jpg|thumb|In [[1995]] Soda Release ''[[Sue<U+00F1>o Stereo]]'', the last of their 7 studio albums. In this album the [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] was utilized as a powerful [[symbol]]: the cover contains three speakers (a bigger one in the middle), posing as ovules surrounded by spermatozoa speakers.

After a three year absence, on the 29th of June 1995, Soda release [[Sue<U+00F1>o Stereo]] (Stereo Dream), their 7th and final studio album. The album was an instant hit quickly reaching [[Music recording sales certification|platinum disc]] in Argentina 15 days after its release.<ref name="sslabanda">{{cite web | url = http://www.sodastereo.com/labanda/index.html | title = La banda | accessdate = 2007-01-04 | work = Soda Stereo official website | language = Spanish | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060424034444/http://www.sodastereo.com/labanda/index.html | archivedate = 2006-04-24 }}</ref> The album was powered by the radio hit <U+201C>Zoom<U+201D> and the promotional video for [[:es:Ella us<U+00F3> mi cabeza como un rev<U+00F3>lver|<U+201C>Ella Uso Mi Cabeza Como Un Revolver<U+201D>]] (She Used My Head Like a Revolver), which in 1996 won the viewers choice award presented by [[MTV]] Latin America. This was a maximum accolade given that this award at the time, since the actual award would not be established until 2002 for Latin MTV.

According to Cerati:

<blockquote>Sue<U+00F1>o Stereo took two years to conceive. It would be illogical to say that this was Soda<U+2019>s masterpiece, but it was the most real expression by the group at the time, because we were stripped of the need of having a group in the future, or of being the best for another ten years. We had already passed through a lot of things and the band itself felt classic. On the other hand, we were very proud of what Dynamo had promoted and its subsequent interpretation. Then, Sue<U+00F1>o Stereo had the pressure of not pressuring us. The band had to deliver something important, it couldn<U+2019>t be a little record. Besides, we had to find ourselves again after a while and allow the music to flow, without thinking too much about taking or step or something like that. In the end, Sue<U+00F1>o Stereo is one of the most innovative records of our career, without us trying to make it so -because of its sonic combinations, its lyrics, and because of its sound.<ref name="pepsi"/></blockquote>

The <U+00E1>lbum b<U+00E9>came the axis for the extensive Gira Sue<U+00F1>o Stereo (Sue<U+00F1>o Stereo Tour), which began on September 8 in [[Buenos Aires]], at the Grand Rex Theater. It covered [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Per<U+00FA>]], [[Panam<U+00E1>]], [[M<U+00E9>xico]] and the [[United States]] ([[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[New York]], and [[Miami]]). The tour finished on the 24th of April of [[1996]] at the Teatro Telet<U+00F3>n in [[Santiago De Chile]].

In mid [[1996]] Soda was invited to Miami by [[MTV]] to record a session for MTV's acoustic show, [[MTV Unplugged]]. After a few refusals by the band, Soda was able to convince the network to accept an offer where the band would play plugged in, but with modifications such as orchestration including new arrangements of some of their classic songs. The result was an eclectic mix of music, some electric, some acoustic, but all bearing the Soda Signature style. A highlight of the album was a soaring rendition of <U+201C>En La Ciudad De La Furia.<U+201D> where the chorus was sung by [[Andrea Echeverri]] of the Colombian [[Rock en Espa<U+00F1>ol]] band [[Aterciopelados]]. Other songs recorded were, <U+201C>Un Misil en Mi Placard,<U+201D> <U+201C>Entre Canibales,<U+201D> <U+201C>Cuando Pase El Temblor,<U+201D> T<U+00E9> Para Tres,<U+201D> <U+201C>Angel Electrico,<U+201D> <U+201C>Terapia de Amor Intensiva,<U+201D> <U+201C>Disco Eterno,<U+201D> <U+201C>Ella Us<U+00F3> Mi Cabeza Como Un Rev<U+00F3>lver,<U+201D> <U+201C>Paseando Por Roma, Y <U+201C>G<U+00E9>nesis<U+201D> (A cover of Vox Dei). The recording of the [[MTV]] show were partially released on the album ''[[Comfort Y M<U+00FA>sica Para Volar]]'' (Comfort and Music to Fly By) ([[1996]]), and in its entirety in a new version of Comfort released in 2007. The album cointained 4 new tracks from the [[Sue<U+00F1>o Stereo]] sessions as well as an interactive cd-rom with pictures and videos from the show.

On the 30th of October of [[1996]] Soda Stereo became the first Latin American band to transmit a live concert via the internet, via the Argentinian radio program Cu<U+00E1>l Es? (Which is?). The show was conducted by [[Mario Pergolini]] on Argentina Rock & Pop radio. The band played live from the music store Prom<U+00FA>sica in BuenoS Aires.<ref name="Rock.mx">{{cite web |url= http://www.rock.com.mx/soda_01_07.html |title= A Una D<U+00E9>cada De Su Despedida Los Veremos Volver  |author= |date= |work= | language = Spanish |publisher= |accessdate=December 10, 2007 }}</ref>

===Band Breakup (1997) ===
A long silence preceded the final farewell, except for band<U+2019>s participation on a Rock En Espa<U+00F1>ol Tribute album, [[:es:Tributo a queen|Tribute a Queen: Los Grandes del Rock en Espa<U+00F1>ol]]. Soda covered <U+201C>Someday One Day,<U+201D> from Queen<U+2019>s 1974 album, Queen II , and sung it in Spanish, as <U+201C>Algun Dia.<U+201D>

Finally, in May 1997 Soda Officially announced their separation through a press release. The following day, Argentiniean newspapers echoed the news. The Argentinian daily [[:es:Diario Clar<U+00ED>n|Clar<U+00ED>n]] devoted a large front page spread to the breakup. The following day, Gustavo Cerati's farewell note was published on the Clar<U+00ED>n supplement for juveniles <U+201C>Yes.<U+201D> The farewell letter read:

<blockquote>These lines were inspired from what I have seen on the street these days, fans who have approached me, the people around me, and from my own personal experience. I share the sadness that has been created in many by our separation. I, myself, am immersed in that state because few things have been so important to me in my life as Soda Stereo. Everyone knows that it is impossible to lead a band without a certain level of conflict. It is a fragile equilibrium in the battle of ideas that very few are able to handle for fifteen years, as we proudly did. But, ultimately, different personal and musical misunderstandings began to compromise that equilibrium. At that juncture, excuses are generated for not confronting ourselves, excuses for a future group that we no longer believed in as we did in the past. To end for the heatlh of the band is, in its redundancy, to enforce value our mental health and above all to show respect for all of our fans who followed us for such a long time. A big hug.<ref name="letter">{{cite web |url=http://www.rpp.com.pe/portada/entretenimiento/101614_1.php

The band carried on with a farewell tour, making stops in [[Mexico]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Chile]]. Their last concert took place on 20 September at the [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|River Plate Stadium]] in Buenos Aires was recorded and released in two parts, ''[[El <U+00DA>ltimo Concierto]]'' A and B.<ref name="nacion">{{cite news | url = http://www.lanacion.com.ar/77304 | title = Tom<U+00E1>telo con Soda | accessdate = 2007-02-07 | date = 1997-09-22 | work = [[La Naci<U+00F3>n]] | language = Spanish | first = Adriana | last = Franco}}</ref> A DVD of the farewell show was released in 2005. The show ended with the song <U+201C>De Musica Ligera<U+201D> and a memorable farewell by Cerati,

<blockquote><U+201C><U+00A1>No s<U+00F3>lo no hubi<U+00E9>ramos sido nada sin ustedes, sino con toda la gente que estuvo a nuestro alrededor desde el comienzo; algunos, siguen hasta hoy! <U+00A1>Gracias.... totales!<U+201D></blockquote>

<blockquote><U+201C>We would have not been anything without you, if not with all of the people that were around us since the beginning; some continue till this day, thank you... totally!<U+201D></blockquote>

A compilation CD was released later that year titled ''[[:es:Chau Soda|Chau Soda]]'' ("Bye Soda"); it contains the most elaborated version of ''[[Signos]]''.

===Post Soda===
Regardless of the constant rumors of a reunion, which ironically started shortly after the breakup, little was heard regarding Soda, except for a TV special on <U+201C>El Ultimo Concierto<U+201D> (The Last Concert) produced by HBO and an MTV documentary titled Soda Stereo: La Leyenda (Soda Stereo: The Legend). Finally, in 2002 the trio was reuinited at the [[Los Premios MTV Latinoam<U+00E9>rica|MTV Latin Music Video Awards]] where they were awarded the Legend award in honor of their musical and visual trajectory.

Seven years after the breakup and the absence of any new official releases seemed odd. Near the end of 2003 [[Sony Music]] announced the release of the first DVD by Soda Stereo, on that contained much unreleased material from compiled by Gustavo, Zeta, Charly, and people close to the band.

The finished product arrived on the streets on November 2004. It was titled, Soda Stereo: Una Parte de La Euforia(1983<U+2013>1997) (Soda Stereo: A Part of the Euphoria (1983<U+2013>1997)). On September 20, 2005 an Argentinian DVD of Soda<U+2019>s last concert, which took place exactly 8 years before at River Plate stadium was released. It was titled El Ultimo Concierto (En Vivo) (The Last Concert <U+2013> Live). The [[DVD]], in contrast to the [[HBO]] production, featured a 5.1 audio and included two songs that were not aired on the HBO concert, <U+201C>Juego de Seduccion<U+201D> and <U+201C>Sobredosis de TV.<U+201D> It also included a multi camera option for a soundcheck of <U+201C>Primavera 0<U+201D> and a 25 minute documentary about the tour featuring footage of sound checks and concerts in [[Mexico]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Argentina]]. It also featured an interview with the long lost <U+201C>fourth Soda<U+201D> [[:es:Alfredo Lois|Alfredo Lois]], the director of the DVD, one his last works before his death.

=== You Will See Me Return(2007)===

The reunification of Soda stereo was a mandatory topic for journalists whenever faced with a former member. So much so, that Zeta Bosio once declared:

One day I dreamed that I was not going to be asked about a Soda reunion!.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/02/18/espectaculos/c-01365463.htm |title= Zeta Bosio: No Encontr<U+00E9> Nuevos Socios |author= |date=February 18, 2007 |work= | language = Spanish|publisher=Clar<U+00ED>n |accessdate=December 20, 2007 }}</ref>

In [[2007]], ten years after the breakup, the band decides to reunite for one time with the goal of accomplishing a grand continental tour. On the 6th of June 2007, the official news came out: Soda Stereo will return to the stage with a sole American tour called ''Me Veras Volver'' (You Will See Me Return), a phrase that<U+2019>s emblematic of their song <U+201C>En La Ciudad de la Furia<U+201D>

In early July Sony/BMG released a new compilation album titled ''Me Ver<U+00E1>s Volver (Hits & +)''. The CD contained 18 studio recordings remastered in 2007. The CD did not contain any new material but it did contain a code to receive exclusive web footage such as live versions. The album reached number one in [[Argentina]] and in [[Chile]].<ref name="">{{cite web |url=http://www.rpp.com.pe/portada/entretenimiento/musica_y_conciertos/103476_1.php|title= Soda Stereo Regresa a Lista de Discos M<U+00E1>s Vendidos de Am<U+00E9>rica Latina |author= |date=November 8, 2007 |work= | language = Spanish |publisher= RPP Noticias |accessdate=December 12, 2007}}</ref>

On the 20th of September 2007, exactly 10 years since their final concert, Soda Stereo gave a long awaited press conference at the Club Museum in Peru, in a historical building designed at the turn of the century by the famous French architect and structural engineer [[Gustave Eiffel]].

The tour was scheduled to begin on October 19 at [[Estadio Antonio Vespucio Liberti|River Plate Stadium]] in Buenos Aires, and originally only two concerts were scheduled as well as performances in several American countries. However, from the time the tickets went on sale it became apparent that the original program would be completely overwhelmed and that the band was faced with a huge continent-wide cultural event. The first two shows sold out in only 24 hours (a total of 90,000 tickets). The band quickly added one more show to the schedule,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://sodastereo.com/noticias/record_historico.php | title = R<U+00E9>cord Hist<U+00F3>rico | date = 2007-06-13 | accessdate = 2007-06-10 | work = Soda Stereo official website | language = Spanish |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070808011746/http://sodastereo.com/noticias/record_historico.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-08-08}}</ref> and after three days, the tickets for the first three shows were sold out, so two more shows were added.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://sodastereo.com/noticias/nuevas_funciones.php | title = Nuevas Funciones | date = 2007-06-15 | accessdate = 2007-06-10 | work = Soda Stereo official website | language = Spanish |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070626013228/http://sodastereo.com/noticias/nuevas_funciones.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-26}}</ref>

Finally on the 19th of October 2007, the time came for the triumphant return of Soda Stereo at the [[Estadio Antonio Vespucio Liberti|River Plate Stadium]] in Argentina. A massive banner that contained a large sentence with the name of their songs intertwined was unveiled.<ref name="">{{cite web |url= http://www.universo.cl/prontus_universo/site/artic/20071020/pags/20071020233904.html |title= Diez a<U+00F1>os despu<U+00E9>s<U+2026> fue un temblor en la ciudad de la furia |author=Costas, Carlos |date=September 20, 2007 |work= | language = Spanish |publisher=Radio Universo |accessdate=December 20, 2007}}</ref>

The band was accompanied by one of the main <U+201C>fourth Soda<U+2019>s<U+201D> [[Tweety Gonzalez]] (keyboards), as well as [[Leandro Fresco]] (keyboards, percussion, and backing vocals), and [[Leo Garcia]] on guitars and backing vocals. The concert lasted more than three hours. Soda played a total of 28 songs. The show opened with a recording of <U+201C>Algun Dia<U+201D> their cover of [[Queen (band)|Queen's]] <U+201C>Someday One Day<U+201D> meanwhile images of the history of Soda Stereo appeared in the background.

The expected amount of fans attending the five shows was more than 300,000, making Soda Stereo one of the most watched public events in the history of Argentina. Soda became the only band to play more than five times in the Estadio Monumental in Argentina in a single tour. Me Ver<U+00E1>s Volver featured 22 concerts throughout America including three shows in the US -all but two were sold out[42].

In October 2007 Sony/BMG released Comfort Y M<U+00FA>sica Para Volar on DVD. The DVD included all of the songs recorded for the MTV unplugged session.

On the 21st of December 2007 the last concert was held at the [[Estadio Antonio Vespucio Liberti|River Plate Stadium]] in Buenos Aires.

==Solo work==
===Gustavo Cerati===
Cerati worked with Daniel Melero in his 1992 album ''Colores Santos'', he co-wrote and produced most of the songs and although the album was never formally presented, two singles were released, "Vuelta por el Universo" and "Hoy Ya No Soy Yo".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cerati.com/proyectos/colores_santos | title = ''Colores Santos'' | accessdate = 2007-01-04 | work = [[Gustavo Cerati]] official website | language = Spanish }}</ref> Cerati's second solo album was ''Amor Amarillo'' (1993), it contained collaborations by Zeta Bosio and Cerati's (then) wife Cecilia Amen<U+00E1>bar.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sodastereo.com/labanda/html/gustavo2.html | title = Gustavo Cerati | accessdate = 2007-01-04 | work = Soda Stereo official website | language = Spanish | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050206134240/http://sodastereo.com/labanda/html/gustavo2.html | archivedate = 2005-02-06 }}</ref>

After Soda's separation, Cerati released the studio albums ''[[Amor Amarillo]]'' (1993), ''[[Bocanada]]'' (1999), ''[[+Bien]]'' (2001) and ''[[Siempre es Hoy|Siempre Es Hoy]]'' (2002). In 2002 he released ''[[11 Episodios Sinf<U+00F3>nicos]]'' that contained some Soda Stereo and solo songs played live with a symphony orchestra. Cerati's last release, ''[[Ah<U+00ED> Vamos]]!'', is considered as a back-to-basics return.<ref>{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r835875|pure_url=yes}} | title = ''Ah<U+00ED> Vamos'' > Overview | accessdate = 2007-01-04 | last = Birchmeier | first = Jason | work = [[Allmusic]] }}</ref> His last album to date is [[Fuerza Natural]], which changes several things about their previous albums and has been very well received by fans and critics.

Cerati was also featured in Shakira's song "The Day and the Time" in her album called Oral Fixation, Volume 2 in 2005. The Spanish version of this song is called "Dia Especial" and can be found in the 1st volume of Fijacion Oral.

===Zeta Bosio===
Bosio has had a low profile over the years. He is working with [http://www.proyectounder.com/ Proyecto Under], an online portal for musicians. He also produced albums with many bands, such as Aguirre and Peligrosos Gorriones.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sodastereo.com/labanda/html/zeta2.html | title = Zeta Bosio | accessdate = 2007-01-04 | work = Soda Stereo official website | language = Spanish | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060504215204/http://sodastereo.com/labanda/html/zeta2.html | archivedate = 2006-05-04 }}</ref> In a recent interview, he declared that he has no interest to play in a band.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.desdeabajoweb.com.ar/zeta.htm | title = Zeta Bosio | accessdate = 2007-01-04 | last = Luna | first = Ver<U+00F3>nica | coauthors = Rodrigo Carretero | work = Desde Abajo | language = Spanish |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061216212138/http://www.desdeabajoweb.com.ar/zeta.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-12-16}}</ref> He is also the artistic director of an independent label, [http://www.alertadiscos.com/ Alerta Records].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.alertadiscos.com | title = Staff | accessdate = 2007-01-04 | work = Alerta! DISCOS | language = Spanish }}</ref>
In 1997 he produced ''Nacion Hip Hop'', a CD compilation of local underground rap artists that is considered{{By whom|date=November 2009}} the founding stone of Argentine's hip hop scene. He also worked closely with hip hop act Tumbas (who opened for Soda Stereo in their last concert) and DJ Tortuga, who later became part of the experimental hip hop trio [[Koxmoz]].

===Charly Alberti===
Alberti released only one studio album without Soda Stereo in 1994, ''Plum'', along with his then girlfriend, supermodel Deborah de Corral,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sodastereo.com/labanda/html/charly2.html | title = Charly Alberti | accessdate = 2007-01-04 | work = Soda Stereo official website | language = Spanish | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060504215211/http://sodastereo.com/labanda/html/charly2.html | archivedate = 2006-05-04 }}</ref> and since 1997 Alberti became interested in informatics, he was involved in running his company Cybrel Digital Entertainment, that aimed at generating and implementing content based technologies. He was named an Applemaster for his contributions to the music world.<ref name="alberti">{{cite web | url = http://www.charlyalberti.com/bioabajo.htm | title = Biograf<U+00ED>a | accessdate = 2007-01-04 | work = [[Charly Alberti]] official website | language = Spanish |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070319054736/http://www.charlyalberti.com/bioabajo.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-03-19}}</ref>

In 1998, he started two new projects, [http://www.urlmag.com URL Magazine], a culture magazine, and [http://www.urlrecords.com URL Records], a discographic label. He is also the founder of [http://www.yeyeye.com YeYeYe] and [http://musike.com Musike], two portals about music and entertainment.<ref name="alberti" />

Alberti recently formed another rock band with his brother, Andr<U+00E9>s Alberti, and recorded their first album named as the band, ''MOLE''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mole.la/ | title = MOLE | work = Mole official website | accessdate = 2007-08-11}}</ref> Alberti stated that he does not want Mole's sound to sound like Soda Stereo, he wants "Mole to live by itself."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/05/02/espectaculos/c-00811.htm | title = Charly Alberti: "Ser un ex Soda facilita las cosas" | work = [[Clar<U+00ED>n (newspaper)|Clar<U+00ED>n]] | date = 2007-05-02 | first = Gaspar | last = Zimerman | language = Spanish | accessdate = 2007-08-11}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Soda Stereo has left a strong legacy among Spanish language musicians both in the rock scene and outside.
