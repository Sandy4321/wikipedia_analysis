"'''Breakaway'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Kelly Clarkson]] from her second album, ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]]''. The song, written by [[Avril Lavigne]], [[Bridget Benenate]] and [[Matthew Gerrard]], was originally intended for Lavigne's debut album ''[[Let Go (Avril Lavigne album)|Let Go]]'' (2002). After being deemed unsuitable for the album, it was passed to Clarkson to be recorded as a soundtrack for the film ''[[The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement]]''. Clarkson, who was finishing her second album at that time, recorded "Breakaway" to tide her fans over until the first single from her new album was released. However, the song's success prompted its inclusion on Clarkson's second album where she decided to name the album after the song. "Breakaway" was first released by [[Walt Disney Records]] as the first single of [[The Princess Diaries soundtracks#The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement|''The Princess Diaries 2'' soundtrack]] on July 20, 2004 which was produced by [[John Shanks]].

"Breakaway" was positively received by music critics, who complimented the song's universal message and its simple lyrics where people could relate to. It incorporates acoustic guitars and airy drums which are interspersed with Clarkson's controlled voice. The lyrics narrate Clarkson's journey as a girl growing up in a small town who follows her dream for self-improvement.  "Breakaway" was a commercial success outside of the United States, where it peaked within the top 20 of multiple European counties, and in the top 10 in Australia, Belgium, Hungary and the Netherlands. In the US, the song peaked at number six on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and became her third top ten song in the chart. It also topped the US [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] for 21 non-consecutive weeks, a record that is now shared between herself and [[Celine Dion]]'s "[[A New Day Has Come (song)|A New Day Has Come]]". 

Directed by [[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]], the accompanying music video for "Breakaway" portrays Clarkson as a young girl from a small town who follows her dream and becomes an international star. It also contained scenes interspersed from ''The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement''. Clarkson acted out most of the lyrics in the music video because she felt that the song was autobiographical. Critics responded positively to the music video for being faithful to the central theme shared by the song, the film, and Clarkson's personal biography. Clarkson performed the song in a series of live appearances such as television shows ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''. She has performed the song in her concert tours, including the [[Stronger Tour]]. "Breakaway" has also been covered by many contestants from reality television singing competitions, notably [[Katie Stevens]], a contestant in the [[American Idol (season 9)|ninth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'', as well as an English pop duo, [[Belle Amie]] who finished eleventh in the [[The X Factor (UK series 7)|seventh season]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]''.

===Critical response===
While reviewing the album, Shirley Shipin of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' opined that "Breakaway" was the highlight of the album where Clarkson sounded "more Avril than Ashlee".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/breakaway-20041215|title= Kelly Clarkson Breakaway|date=December 15, 2004|accessdate=September 4, 2012|last=Shipin|first=Shirley |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]].

He explained, "I was a little worried, her coming off 'American Idol,' it inherently feels manufactured and I didn't know how much of it was true artistry. But when I met her, she really does have a good, solid vibe. It was an honor to bring some of that out of her."<ref name="video">{{cite news|url=http://origin.mtv.com/news/articles/1489852/kelly-clarkson-shoots-video-avril-song.jhtml|title=Avril Lavigne Helps Kelly Clarkson Become A Pop 'Princess'|date=July 30, 2004|accessdate=September 5, 2012|last=Moss |first=Carey |publisher=MTV.com. Viacom}}</ref> Since the song is autobiographical, Clarkson decided to act out most of the lyrics in the video. Meyers also realized that the song was featured in ''The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement'' and he struggled to find a way to address the film-footage in the music video, saying "Since it's a movie tie-in, the idea stems from trying to figure out a new way of addressing the film-footage requirement they put on you, so we came up with the idea of her attending the premiere, which is very much something she will do in real life."<ref name="video"/>

The video begins with the younger version of Clarkson sitting at the back seat of a station wagon. Singing the first verse, she witnesses a depressing scene of her brother quarreling with her sister who are scolded by their mother. She slowly clasps both her hands before the video shifts to the present day where Clarkson is seen arriving on the red carpet with her publicist for the world premiere of ''The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement''. After posing for the photographers, she enters the cinema and watches the film. The next scene switches back to the younger Clarkson who is sitting and looking around her neighbourhood at her house's rooftop as a plane is seen flying across the sky. The video switches back to the older Clarkson who is now watching the aforementioned film in her laptop inside the plane as it goes through a mild turbulence. Clarkson is also seen reminiscing about her past job as a worker in a movie theater, singing with her co-workers. The next scene shows Clarkson singing with her band in a backyard party which is shown alternately with scenes from the film, as well as a montage of her family and co-workers waving away from her. In the final scene, the younger Clarkson is shown praying by her bedside.<ref name="video"/><ref name="review">{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E4D61130F93AA2575AC0A9629C8B63|title=DANCE: MUSIC VIDEO; The American Idol Diaries|date=September 19, 2004|accessdate=September 5, 2012|last=Aurthur|first=Kate |publisher=[[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]].

==Cover versions==
"Breakaway" has also been covered by contestants from reality television singing competitions. [[Katie Stevens]] covered the song on the [[American Idol (season 9)|ninth season]] of ''American Idol''. Despite listening to the judges' comments to sing a contemporary song, her rendition was criticized from the judges; [[Randy Jackson]] thought the note was too big for Stevens while [[Ellen DeGeneres]] felt Stevens did not sell the lyrics. [[Kara DioGuardi]] said, "I don't think you know who you are yet as an artist", an opinion agreed by [[Simon Cowell]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1633572/american-idol-ladies-night-didi-benami-crystal-bowersox-shine.jhtml|title='American Idol' Ladies Night: Didi Benami And Crystal Bowersox Shine|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=March 9, 2010|accessdate=September 7, 2012 |publisher=MTV.
