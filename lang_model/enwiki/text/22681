The '''Michigan State Capitol''' is the building housing the legislative and executive branches of the government of the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. It is located in the [[List of U.S. state capitals|state capital]] of [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] in [[Ingham County, Michigan|Ingham County]]. The present structure, at the intersection of Capitol and Michigan Avenues, is a [[National Historic Landmark]] that currently houses the chambers and offices of the [[Michigan Legislature]] as well as the ceremonial offices of the [[List of Governors of Michigan|Governor of Michigan]] and [[Lieutenant Governor of Michigan|Lieutenant Governor]]. Historically, this is the third building to house the Michigan government.<ref name="capitolhistory">{{cite web | url=http://www.senate.michigan.gov/Virtualtour/statecapitol.htm | title=The Michigan State Capitol | year=1988 | publisher=Michigan Senate (original material from Michigan Department of Management and Budget) | accessdate=2007-10-13}}</ref>

The first state capitol was located in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], the original capital of Michigan, and was relocated to Lansing in 1847, due to the need to develop the western portions of the state and for easy defense from [[British Army|British troops]] stationed in [[Windsor, Ontario]]. The present capitol building, preceded by a temporary [[Light-frame construction|wood frame]] structure, was dedicated in January 1879, and is designed in a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style, more specifically the [[Italianate]] style.<ref name="capitol">{{cite web | url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/hal_lm_capinfo_54904_7.pdf |format=PDF|  title=Your State Capitol, A Walking Tour | year=1999 | publisher=Michigan Historical Center | accessdate=2007-10-13}}</ref> The capitol was rededicated in 1992 after a three-year restoration project.

==History==
===First state capitol===
On July 13, 1787, the [[Continental Congress|Second Continental Congress]] passed the [[Northwest Ordinance]], creating the [[Northwest Territory]] which included Michigan. In 1805, the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] created the [[Michigan Territory]].<ref name="capitol" /> Michigan first applied for [[List of U.S. states by date of statehood|statehood]] as early as 1832, though it was rebuffed due to a dispute with [[Ohio]] over the [[Toledo Strip]], a 468-square mile (1,210&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) area that included the important port city of [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]]. By 1835, Michigan had formed a state government without receiving authorization from Congress to do so. The boundaries of the state included the contested area.

[[Image:Capitol union school.jpg|thumb|left|The original capitol building in Detroit sometime around 1847]]
The dispute culminated in what has become known as the [[Toledo War]], as Michigan and Ohio militia took up arms in the area. As a condition for entering the Union, Michigan was forced to accept the western three quarters of the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] in exchange for ceding its claim to the Toledo Strip. After a state convention first rejected this condition, a second convention, assembled under some duress in December 1836, reluctantly accepted the terms and Michigan became the 26th state on January 26, 1837, with [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] as its first capital.

The first building to serve as the State Capitol was built in 1832 as the ''Territorial Courthouse''. This brick structure was one of the earliest [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek revival]] buildings in Michigan, with a [[portico]] of [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[Classical order|columns]] and a central tower of 140&nbsp;feet (42&nbsp;m). Built at a cost of [[United States dollar|$]]24,500, the building housed the territorial government and state legislatures until 1848, when a hastily-erected wood building was constructed in [[Lansing]] following a decision made March 17, 1847, to move the capital from Detroit to Lansing. The Detroit building then became a [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] (the Union School, at one time city's only [[high school]]) and library until it burned in 1893.<ref name="capitolhistory" />

===Second state capitol===
The 1835 [[Michigan Constitution]]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.michigan.gov/hal/0,1607,7-160-15481_19271_19357-56877--,00.html| title=Constitution of the State of Michigan of 1835| year=2005| publisher=Archives of Michigan, Michigan Library and Historical Center| accessdate=2007-10-13 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071012183757/http://michigan.gov/hal/0,1607,7-160-15481_19271_19357-56877--,00.html |archivedate= October 12, 2007}}</ref> provided that:
:''The seat of government for this state shall be at Detroit, or at such other place or places as may be prescribed by law until the year eighteen hundred and forty-seven, when it shall be permanently located by the legislature.''<ref name="capitolhistory" /> 

[[Image:Old capitol bldg.jpg|thumb|left|The original Lansing structure before 1882]]
Prior to 1847, Detroit fought to maintain the capital within its jurisdiction, but communities in the growing western part of the state had many reasons for wanting a move inland, including the need to increase defensibility by moving the state government away from the [[United States-Canada border|Canadian border]].<ref name="capitolhistory" /> Detroit had been occupied during the [[War of 1812]], and the border area of Michigan of less than a mile between Detroit and [[Windsor, Ontario]], at the [[Detroit River]] continued to be occupied by British troops on both banks. Proponents of moving the capital also sought to promote settlement and the economy in the interior, as well as making the great government more accessible to the people throughout the state.<ref name="capitolhistory" />

Contenders seeking designation as the new capital included [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Jackson, Michigan|Jackson]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], and [[Shiawassee Township]] in [[Shiawassee County]]. At one point during the debate, [[Marshall, Michigan|Marshall]] officials were so certain of its selection that they built a governor's mansion.<ref name="capitolhistory" /> After extensive debate, State Senator [[Joseph H. Kilbourne]] of Ingham County proposed that the nearly-uninhabited Lansing Township be made the seat of government. The legislature agreed, with the location north of Ann Arbor, west of Detroit, and east of Grand Rapids being deemed a suitable compromise. The legislature renamed it as the Town of Michigan, though by 1848 the original name of Lansing was restored.<ref name="capitol" />

Construction began in 1847 on the state capitol building in Lansing, a temporary structure on the block bordered by Washington Avenue, Capitol Avenue, Allegan Street, and Washtenaw Street. It was a simple two-story wood frame structure, painted white with green wooden [[Window shutter|shutters]] and topped by a tin [[cupola]]. The total cost for construction was $22,952.01.<ref name="capitolhistory" /> The building was sold when the permanent capitol building opened in 1879. It was then used as a factory until, like the first capitol, it was destroyed by a fire in 1882.<ref name="capitolhistory" />

===Third state capitol===
[[Image:cornerstoneMI.jpg|thumb|The cornerstone for the current state capitol being lowered into place]]
In the early 1870s, Governor [[Henry P. Baldwin]] urged the legislature to fund a new, permanent capitol. On March 31, 1871, a bill was adopted "for the erection of a new state capitol, and a building for the temporary use of the state officers." The new capitol was to cost $1.2 million, to be raised by a six-year state [[income tax]].<ref name="capitolhistory" />

In 1872, architect [[Elijah E. Myers]] of [[Springfield, Illinois]], was selected to design the new capitol building. His design, named "Tuebor" (which means "I will defend"), was selected.<ref name="capitol" /> Myers used the central dome and wing design found in the [[United States Capitol]] in his design and subsequently went on to design two other state capitol buildings, the statehouses of [[Colorado State Capitol]] and [[Texas State Capitol]], as well as the former territorial capitol building of [[Idaho]], the most by any architect.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.senate.michigan.gov/Virtualtour/elijah-myers.htm| title=Elijah E. Myers| publisher=Michigan Senate (original material from Michigan Department of Management and Budget)| year=1988| accessdate=2007-10-13}}</ref> The cornerstone was laid on October 2, 1873, with about 7,000 Lansing residents and some 30,000 to 50,000 visitors attending.<ref name="capitolhistory" /> Construction and finishing work were completed by late 1878. The new capitol, with 139 rooms, was dedicated at the same time as the inauguration of Governor [[Charles Croswell]] on January 1, 1879.<ref name="capitolhistory" />  

The Lansing capitol building inspired a national trend after the [[American Civil War]] for [[Firewall (construction)|fireproof]] buildings, large enough to house expanding government as well as serving as a durable repository for artifacts of the war<ref name="capitol_nhs">{{Cite document|title={{PDFlink|[http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/71000396.pdf National Historic Landmark Nomination&mdash;Michigan State Capitol]|1.49&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 1569821 bytes -->}}|date=February 28, 1992 |author=Kerry Chartkoff |publisher=National Park Service|postscript=<!--None-->}} and {{PDFlink|[http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Photos/71000396.pdf Accompanying 13 photos, exterior and interior, from c.1885, 1990, 1992, and undated.]|1.66&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 1743478 bytes -->}}</ref> (including [[war flag|battle flags]] that were subsequently moved to the Michigan Historical Museum in 1990<ref name="capitol" />).Over the years the dome, which at first matched the light tan of the building, was repainted a bright white. The legislature funded an extensive historical restoration starting in 1989 which was completed in 1992.<ref name="capitol" /> The restoration returned the dome to an off-white shade and made improvements to the interior, providing for access to people with disabilities as well as restoring many of the original interior designs. One of the largest phases of the restoration entailed removal of "half-floors" that were installed in 1969 to create 50,000 square feet of additional office space.  The floors were created by dividing the 16-foot-high rooms horizontally and creating a level of rooms which was accessed from the stairway landing.<ref name=court>{{citeweb|url=http://www.micourthistory.org/lansing_capitol.php|title=The Michigan State Capitol's Historic Supreme Court Chamber|publisher=Michigan Supreme Court Historical Society|date=|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}</ref>  The Capitol Building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on January 25, 1971 (NRHP Reference #71000396), and was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] on October 5, 1992.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1108&ResourceType=Building | title=Michigan State Capitol | date=2007-09-18 | work=National Historic Landmark summary listing | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate=2007-10-13}}</ref>

==The capitol today==
===Building===
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Michigan capitol dome.jpg|image2=Mi-cap-Dome-Ceiling.jpg|width=200|caption2=Interior of the capitol dome}}
The Michigan State Capitol is 267&nbsp;feet (81.3&nbsp;m) from the ground to the tip of finial/spire above the dome. The building is {{convert|420|ft|m}} and two&nbsp;inches (128&nbsp;m) long and {{convert|273|ft|m}} and 11&nbsp;inches (83.4&nbsp;m) wide (including approaches). The capitol occupies 1&nbsp;and&nbsp;1/6&nbsp;[[acre]]s (4,700&nbsp;m<U+00B2>), has a perimeter of 1,520&nbsp;feet (463&nbsp;m).<ref name="capitol_nhs" /> There are four stories in the building, with public entrances on the ground floor. Two grand staircases in the north and south corridors go up to the top floor.<ref name="capitol" />

When it opened, the Capitol structure was large enough to host all the state agencies and departments. Due to the growth of state government, however, only the offices of Senate and House leadership, and ceremonial offices for the governor and lieutenant governor remain in the capitol.  The former [[Michigan Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] chambers are now used by the Senate Appropriations Committee.<ref name="capitol" /> The [[Library of Michigan|Michigan Library and Historical Center]] (housing the state library, museum and archives) is located two blocks west of the Capitol. The [[Michigan Hall of Justice]] is located at the west end of the Capitol mall. Two legislative office buildings are located across from the east front of the Capitol building.

The ground floor corridors led to "store rooms" designed by the architect in the original building plans. This includes an armory in the southwest corner of the south corridor. The original wood floor has been replaced by gray tiles. The rooms were originally lit with gas fixtures, though by 1900, the entire building had been refitted with electric lights.<ref name="capitol" /> Today the ground floor is home to several different offices, including the Secretary of the Senate, the Clerk of the House, and the Capitol Tours and Information Service.<ref name="capitol" /> 

Starting with the first floor and continuing to the third, black and white floor tiling is made of [[Vermont]] marble and limestone. The exception is the floor of the rotunda which is composed of 976 blocks of translucent glass.  The blocks vary in size so that when viewed from the upper floors, they appear to form a bowl which mirrors the dome above.  The doorknobs are mostly made of a brass and bronze alloy (most of the original brass doorknobs have disappeared over time). The present doorknobs and hinges, locked for protection, display the state [[Seal_of_Michigan|coat of arms]]. Though the building appears to have walnut woodwork, the wood is actually Michigan white pine that has been wood-grained to give the appearance of walnut.<ref name="capitol" />

[[Image:Michigan State Capitol Muses.jpg|thumb|left|Muses]]
The first floor gives visitors their first view of the interior of the [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]]. Below the [[cast iron|cast-iron]] dome, the ceiling displays eight [[muse]]s painted in 1886. For more than a century, the muses' artist remained anonymous; it is now known that it was [[Tommaso Juglaris]], who created them in his [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] studio and never came to Michigan.<ref name="capitol" /> On the north wall of the first floor is a large clock, called a long-drop clock. It was once the building's [[Reference clock|master clock]] and is at least as old as the Capitol. The clock was restored in 1990 and is currently in working condition.<ref name="capitol" />

The second floor, in addition to housing the gubernatorial offices, features the Gallery of Governors with portraits of former Michigan Governors on the walls of the rotunda; the gallery extends up to the third floor. The governor's offices were among the most extensively restored during the 1989&ndash;1992 restoration. The office features a suite of original furnishings manufactured in 1876 by the [[Feige Brothers Company]] of [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]].<ref name="capitol" /> The former chambers of the Michigan Supreme Court are located in the south wing of the building. The court vacated its chambers in 1970 for larger quarters, eventually moving to its current location in the [[Michigan Hall of Justice]].<ref name="capitol" />

Public access to Michigan's legislative bodies is through the third floor. The capitol building holds the chambers and offices of the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Michigan Legislature|state legislature]], which is composed of the [[Michigan House of Representatives]] and [[Michigan Senate]]. Public galleries are at both ends of the third floor. The Senate, with 38 members, has its chambers on the south side of the building, while the House of Representatives, with 110 members, has its chambers in the north wing. House sessions are normally held on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 1:00 PM and Thursdays at 10:30 AM, while Senate sessions begin at 10:00 AM on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Both houses occasionally convene on Mondays and Fridays.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/publications/citizensguide.pdf#search='michigan%20capitol%20complex | title=Citizen's Guide to State Government | format=PDF| year=2005 | publisher=Michigan Capitol Committee | accessdate=2007-10-13}}</ref> Senate and House sessions are taped by [[Michigan Government Television]], a public service body transmitted to local [[cable television]] systems. Similar to [[C-SPAN]], MGTV has made live coverage of the legislative proceedings available since July 15, 1996.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mgtv.org/story.html | title=The MGTV Story | year=1999 | publisher=Michigan Government Television | accessdate=2007-10-13| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929132104/http://www.mgtv.org/story.html| archivedate = September 29, 2007}}</ref>

{{Double image|right|Michigan Senate.jpg|200|Michigan House of Representatives.jpg|200|State Senate chambers|House of Representatives chambers}}
Although having the same basic floor plan, the House and Senate chambers are decorated very differently, with the former in [[terra cotta]] and [[Teal (color)|teal]] colors and the latter in blue and gold. An oval [[cartouche]] in the carpet at the entrance to the House chamber features the [[List of state flowers|state flower]]. Presiding over the house is the [[speaker of the house|speaker]], whose chair is behind a desk in the center with a plaster and paint version of the [[Seal of Michigan|state coat of arms]]. The Senate chambers are somewhat smaller than the House. The [[president of the Senate]] is the [[Lieutenant Governor of Michigan|lieutenant governor]], who presides over sessions from a [[walnut]] [[rostrum]] at the front of the chambers. Both the House and the Senate use computerized voting systems, including wall-mounted screens that allow visitors to follow the voting. Both the House and the Senate also contain glass tiled ceilings that allow natural light to shine through etched glass panels to better light the room. These ceiling tiles feature the coats-of-arms of each state in the United States.<ref name="capitol" />

===Grounds===
[[Image:71p1010084.jpg|left|thumb|Michigan State Capitol]]
The Capitol Pediment, located above the main front entrance to the building, is entitled "The Rise and Progress of Michigan." It depicts a central figure, Michigan, who is dressed as a Native American. She offers a book and globe to the people of her state, promising a bright future. She is surrounded by symbols of Michigan's economy, including a plow, [[cornucopia]], and a laurel wreath to represent agriculture. Also included are symbols representing shipping, mining, and lumbering.<ref name="capitol" />

The cornerstone, located at the northeast corner of the building, is a large stone with dates carved on it. On one side is "1872", which marks the start of construction of the capitol. On the other side is "1878", marking the year of completion. The stone was opened during ceremonies on November 15, 1978, the centennial of the building's completion. Various documents enclosed within the stone had been damaged by weather, although several coins from the era were recovered. It was closed and resealed with 38 new items depicting Michigan's history, people, and lifestyles. Another stone located on capitol grounds is the GAR Stone, a memorial to American Civil War veterans who fought for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. It was erected in 1924.<ref name="capitol" />

[[Image:Michigan-Capitol-2005.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Michigan State Capitol]]
A few notable trees are located on the grounds. An [[Eastern White Pine]], the [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of Michigan, is located in the front of the building. The Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Tree was planted in memory of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in 1984. The oldest tree on the grounds is a [[catalpa]] that was present at the time the Capitol was dedicated in 1873. The [[American Forestry Association]] has certified that this catalpa is the largest living tree of its kind in the United States.<ref name="capitol_nhs" /><ref>{{cite journal | author=Gangloff, Deborah | title=[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1016/is_n1-2_v98/ai_11875270 Introduction: the 1992 edition, national register of big trees] | journal=American Forests | date=January <U+2013> February 1992 | accessdate=2007-10-13}}</ref> The most recently dedicated tree is a blue spruce called "the Freedom Tree", planted in 1973 as a memorial to the [[Vietnam War]]'s [[missing-in-action]] and [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].<ref name="capitol" />
