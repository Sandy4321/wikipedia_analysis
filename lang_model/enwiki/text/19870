==Elected [[Maha Nayaka]]==

An election by secret vote was held on November 27, 1955, at [[Vajiraramaya]], [[Bambalapitiya]], to select the Maha Nayaka Thera to succeed Ven. Palane Vagiragnana Nayake Thera. At the election those 141 [[Bhikku]]s of the Nikaya cast their votes, and Ven. Madihe Pannasiha received 109, with the other contender 32 votes. Accordingly, Ven. Madihe Pannasiha was elected the Maha Nayaka Thera of the Amarapura Sri Dharmarakkhita Nikaya by a clear majority vote.

The certificate of appointment of Maha Nayake was handed over at Vajiraramaya [[Bambalapitiya]], in the presence of a very large gathering of Nayake Theras of the 3 Nikayas, viz. Siam, Amarapura and Ramanna.

A few days after the appointment, Sir Cyril de Soysa and R. Premadasa, the late President, an MMC Colombo at that time had called on the Maha Nayaka Thera individually and after conferring his good wishes had made a request which has come to effect and that was to incorporate all sects of the Amarapura Nikaya to one. The first Vinaya Karma was held at Maharagama on July 13, 1969. It has not only united the Nikaya, but also made him the head of the United Amarapura Nikaya.

==Buddhist Committee of Inquiring==

In April 1954 a committee was appointed by the all Ceylon Buddhist Congress composed of members from Buddhist clergy and laity in order to ascertain salient facts about the conditions and ways of Buddhist life. Ven. Madihe Pannasiha Thera was among the members of that committee which issued its report on  February 4,  1956.

==Buddha Sasasana Committee==

Sir Oliver Goonetilake, the Governor-General appointed a Buddha Sasana Commission on March 4, 1957 under the chairmanship of Ven. Kalukondayawe Pangnasekera Maha Nayaka Thera and Ven. Madihe Pannasiha was also a member of that Commission, which issued its report after visiting Buddhist countries abroad.

After this report was issued it was Ven. Madihe Pannasiha Maha Nayaka Thera, who took up the issues such as taking over all assisted schools to the government and making all Poya days public holidays instead of Sundays.

==Propagation of Buddhism==

The Thera visited China in 1946 for the propagation of [[Theravada Buddhism]].

He also visited [[Kathmandu]] in [[Nepal]] for a higher ordination of Bhikahkus in 1951 and in 1954 to establish a Seema Malaka in Lalith Pura, Nepal and  he renamed the Buddhist Vihara there from "Young Sumangala Vihara" to "Sri Sumangala Vihara". 

Ven. Thera visited Burma on January 4, 1954, and attended the Dharma Sangayanava, and in 1956 during the 2500 Buddha Jayantiya took part in the establishment of a Seema Malaka .

The Maha Nayaka Thera left for America on 27th March, 1964 on an invitation from the Asia Foundation to gain an idea of the educational training prevailing there, ways and means of rural development, and also for the propagation of Theravada Buddhism in America. He spent 5 months there and made arrangements to establish a Vihara in Washington in 1964. Other places of his visit were England, West Indies, Scotland, Denmark, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, Vietnam, Hong Kong and Singapore. On his return he established the Buddhist Information Centre at Greenpath, Colombo, the first of its kind in order to furnish information to any interested in Buddhism. The World Buddhist Directory is published by this Information Center.

==Thurunu Saviya==

After returning from USA the Maha Nayaka Thera organised the "Thurunu Saviya" at Maharagama to organise and train the youths of this country. The Maha Nayaka Thera considered that the young generation in Sri Lanka should be directed in the correct lines. This movement attracted many youths and this resulted in a society called "Samma Ajeeva Sangamaya" in 1974. This was necessary to counter the increasing rate of drug addiction and alcoholism among the youths of this country. The Ven. Maha Nayaka Thera played an important role in the rehabilitation of youths after the insurrection of 1971.

==Dharma Vijaya Foundation==

The Dharma Vijaya Foundation established in 1979 under the patronage of the Maha Nayaka Thera has noble objectives. To make Sri Lanka a Dharma Deepa or a country where righteous people live, to develop the economy and the culture of the country simultaneously and also to serve the poor in their social needs and education.

==Temperance Movement==

He succeeded the Ven. Kalubondayawe Pangnasekera Maha Nayaka Thera as the president of the Sri Lanka Temperance Movement, to carry out the good work commenced during the early part of the 20th century.

The Thera was conferred an honorary Ph.D. from the University of Peradeniya in 1987, and the honorific title Agga Maha Panditha from Burma in the year 1996.
He died on September 9, 2003.
