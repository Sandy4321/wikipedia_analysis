The '''Middle Street Synagogue''' is a [[synagogue]] in the centre of [[Brighton]], part of the [[England|English]] city of [[Brighton and Hove]].  It was the centre for [[Judaism|Jewish]] worship in Brighton and Hove for more than a century, and has been called Brighton's second most important historic building.  Although it is no longer used for regular services, the building is still open at certain times.  It has been [[Listed building|listed]] at Grade II*, reflecting its architectural and historic importance.

==History==
A Jewish community existed in the Brighton area for nearly a century before Middle Street synagogue was built in 1874.<ref name="EJP">{{cite web|title=English synagogue handed massive government grant|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/4863|accessdate=2007-12-30|publisher=European Jewish Press|date=2007|work=European Jewish Press website}}</ref><ref name="Dale192">{{Harvnb|Dale|1989|p=192.}}</ref>  A [[Bavaria]]n settler, Emanuel Hyam Cohen, established a Jewish school on the seafront in the 1780s and a place of worship between 1789 and 1792.<ref name="Dale192"/><ref name="Elleray13">{{Harvnb|Elleray|2004|p=13.}}</ref>  The latter moved from Jew Street (off Bond Street) to West Street in 1808, but there is no record of the nature of the buildings; meetings may in fact have taken place in private houses.<ref name="Dale192"/>  The [[Brighton Regency Synagogue]] was built in 1823 on land leased from a hotel, and enlarged by [[David Mocatta]] (architect of [[Brighton railway station]], and member of the prominent Jewish [[Mocatta]] family) in 1836.

The [[Sassoon family]], a wealthy Jewish dynasty with links to Brighton and Hove, funded various expansions and improvements over the next few decades, especially in respect of the internal fittings, which are very elaborate for a synagogue.  Electric lighting was installed in 1892, making it the first electrically-lit synagogue in Britain.<ref name="EncB115"/><ref name="IoE482160">{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=482160&mode=quick|title=Detailed Record: The Synagogue and attached gate, Middle Street (east side), Brighton, Brighton and Hove, East Sussex|year=2007|work=[[Images of England]] website|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref>  Although the Jewish community in the city numbered 4,000 by 2004, the Middle Street synagogue fell out of regular use at that time, although it is still opened regularly for educational and architectural tours of the interior,<ref name="EJP"/> especially during the annual [[Brighton Festival]].<ref name="Festival">{{cite web|title=Brighton Festival Fringe 2008|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20061009135957/http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/listings/tours/index.asp?pg=2&|accessdate=2009-03-10|publisher=Brighton Festival Fringe Ltd|date=2007|work=Brighton Festival Fringe website}}</ref>  Urgent structural repairs, including a new roof, were required by that time.  A combination of fundraising concerts, auctions and a grant of several hundred thousand pounds from the government agency [[English Heritage]] enabled restoration work to take place.<ref name="EJP"/>  The building is presently undergoing extensive renovation works and tours will re-commence in the latter part of 2009.

Middle Street Synagogue was listed at Grade II* by [[English Heritage]] on 20 August 1971.<ref name="IoE482160"/>  This status is given to "particularly important buildings of more than special interest".<ref name="EH2">{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.1373#grades|title=Listed buildings: What do the different grades mean?|year=2008|work=English Heritage website|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref>  It is one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures in the city of [[Brighton and Hove]].<ref name="IoEStats-ESx">{{cite web|title=Images of England <U+2014> Statistics by County (East Sussex)|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/StatisticsPage/default.aspx?StatsCounty=EAST%20SUSSEX|work=[[Images of England]] website|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|year=2007|accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref>

==Architecture==
The synagogue has been described as Brighton's second most important historic building, behind the [[Royal Pavilion]].<ref name="EJP"/>  

The exterior, which was executed in pale Sussex brick by the builders George Cheesman and son, is  in an eclectic blend of [[Italian Renaissance#Architecture|Italian Renaissance]] and [[Neo-Byzantine architecture|Neo-Byzantine Revival]] styles.<ref name="Kadish73">{{Harvnb|Kadish|2006|p=73.}}</ref>  The west-facing elevation to Middle Street uses yellow bricks in an [[Brickwork#English bond|English bond pattern]], while the other walls are of brown brick.<ref name="IoE482160"/>  The arched windows are surmounted by contrasting red and blue tiles, and are flanked by red coloured columns.<ref name="Dale194"/><ref name="Building2P"/>  There is a large [[rose window]] in the west-facing frontage.  The fa<U+00E7>ade consists of five bays, alternately projecting and recessed; on the ground floor the layout of windows (protected since the 1960s with translucent safety panels) is two in each end bay and one each in the two recessed bays, with the wooden entrance door on the centre bay (between two pink columns with ornamented [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]]).  On the first floor, the eight windows are arranged in pairs on the three projecting bays, with one in each of the recesses.<ref name="IoE482160"/>

[[Sharman Kadish]] remarks that ''"Nothing prepares the visitor for the sumptuousness of Middle Street's interior."''<ref name="Kadish73"/>  There are ladies' galleries on three sides, held up by cast-iron columns decorated with imitation marble-effect paintwork with gilded metalwork capitals depicting plants, fruit, flowers and crops from the Middle East region.<ref name="EncB115"/><ref name="IoE482160"/>    Thomas Lainson's design for the interior followed the [[Neo-Byzantine architecture|Neo-Byzantine Revival]] style, .<ref name="Dale194"/>  The building takes the form of a [[basilica]].  There are ladies' galleries on three sides, held up by cast-iron columns decorated with imitation marble-effect paintwork.   the capitals are fashioned of hammered copper and iron, each one is individually worked to show a different one of the species of   plants, fruit, flowers and crops from the Land of Israel.<ref name="EncB115"/><ref name="IoE482160"/><ref name="Kadish73"/>

The particularly decorative and ornate interior, funded by the generosity of the Sassoon family and visitors from outside Brighton,<ref name="EncB115"/><ref name="IoE482160"/> was built mostly of iron, but the surfaces that meet the eye are lavishly stenciled, gilded, or made of brass, marble, and mosaics..<ref name="IoE482160"/>  The [[Torah Ark]] sits on a marble-stepped [[dais]] in the centre of the [[apse]], below an arch supported by elaborate columns.    It is top-lit via a stained glass half-dome.  The surrounding rails, [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] and [[pulpit]] are all brass.<ref name="IoE482160"/>  There is late-19th century stained glass in all of the windows,<ref name="IoE482160"/> much of it by Campbell & Smith.
