'''Tartan''' is a pattern consisting of criss-crossed horizontal and vertical bands in multiple colours. Tartans originated in woven cloth, now used in many other materials.  Tartan is particularly associated with [[Scotland]]. Scottish [[kilt]]s almost always have tartan patterns. (Tartan is also known as [[plaid (pattern)|plaid]] in [[North America]], but in Scotland, a plaid is a tartan cloth slung over the [[shoulder]] or a [[blanket]].)

Tartan is made with alternating bands of coloured (pre-dyed) threads woven as both [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[weft]] at [[right angle]]s to each other.  The weft is woven in a simple [[twill]], two over - two under the warp, advancing one thread each pass. This forms visible diagonal lines where different colours cross, which give the appearance of new colours blended from the original ones.  The resulting blocks of colour repeat vertically and horizontally in a distinctive pattern of squares and lines known as a [[sett (textiles)|sett]]. 

Until the middle of the nineteenth century, the highland tartans were associated with regions or districts, rather than by any specific [[Scottish Clan|clan]]. This was due to the fact that tartan designs were produced by local weavers for local tastes and would tend to make use of the natural dyes available in that area. The patterns were simply different regional checked-cloth patterns, whereof one chose the tartans most to one's liking  - in the same way as people nowadays choose what colours and patterns they prefer in their clothing. Thus, it was not until the mid 1800s that specific tartans became associated with [[Scottish clan]]s or Scottish families, or simply institutions who are (or wish to be seen as) associated in some way with a Scottish heritage.<ref>M.A. Newsome, 'The Scottish Tartans Museum': http://www.scottishtartans.org/tartan.html</ref> 

It is generally stated that the most popular tartans today are the ''[[Black Watch]]'' (also known as ''Campbell'', ''Grant Hunting'', ''Universal'', ''Government'') and ''[[Royal Stewart tartan|Royal Stewart]]''.<ref name="MacDonald1995--48"/> Today tartan is no longer limited to textiles but is used on non-woven mediums, such as paper, plastics, packaging, and wall coverings.<ref name="tartangenerator.com--construction">http://www.tartangenerator.com/tartan/pages/construction.html</ref>

==Etymology and terminology==
[[Image:Highland soldier 1744.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from a Highland Regiment circa 1744. The private is wearing a [[belted plaid]].]]

The [[English language|English]] word ''tartan'' is derived from the [[French language|French]] ''tiretain''. This French word is likely derived from the [[verb]] ''tirer'' in reference to [[woven]] cloth (as opposed to [[Knitting|knitted]] cloth).{{#tag:ref|It has also been sugested that ''tartan'' may be derived from the [[cognate]] in the modern [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''tarsainn'',<ref name="BanksdelaChapelle--57">Banks; de la Chapelle (2007), p. 57.</ref> meaning "across".|group=note}} Today ''tartan'' usually refers to coloured patterns, though originally a tartan did not have to be made up of any pattern at all. As late as the 1830s tartan was sometimes described as "plain coloured ... without pattern".<ref name="scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames"/> Patterned cloth from the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] speaking [[Scottish Highlands]] was called ''breacan'', meaning many colours. Over time the meanings of ''tartan'' and ''breacan'' were combined to describe certain type of pattern on a certain type of cloth. Today ''tartan'' is generally used to describe a pattern, and it is not limited to only [[textiles]].<ref name="scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames"/> Today the term ''plaid'' is commonly used to describe what is actually ''tartan''.<ref name="scottishtartans.org--faq">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishtartans.org/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2008-10-16 |work=Scottish Tartans Museum (scottishtartans.org) }}</ref> Both terms however, originally had separate meanings. The word ''plaid'' is derived from the Scottish Gaelic ''plaide'', meaning "blanket".<ref>MacBain (1911), p. 277.; see also: Merriam-Webster (2003), p. 947.</ref> Originally ''plaid'' was first used to describe the rectangular, blanket-like garment, sometimes made up of tartan, that preceded the modern kilt (see: [[belted plaid]]). In time, ''plaid'' was used to describe blankets themselves.<ref name="scottishtartans.org--faq"/> The pattern of a tartan is called a ''sett''. The sett is made up of a series of woven threads which cross at [[right angle]]s.<ref name="scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames"/>

==Construction==
[[Image:Tartan diagram (warp and weft)A.svg|left|thumb|150px|Diagram A, the warp]][[Image:Tartan diagram (warp and weft)B.svg|left|150px|thumb|Diagram B, the weft.]][[Image:Tartan diagram (warp and weft)C.svg|left|150px|thumb|Diagram C, the tartan. The combining of the warp and weft.]]
Each thread in the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] crosses each thread in the [[weft]] at right angles. When a thread in the warp crosses a thread in the weft of the same colour, it produces a solid colour on the tartan. If a thread crosses another of a different colour, it produces a mixture of the two colours in equal proportion. Thus, a sett of two base colours produces one mixture, for a total of three different colours. The total number of colours, including mixtures, increases out of proportion to the number of base colours. So, a sett of six base colours produces fifteen mixtures, for a total of twenty-two different colours. This means that the more stripes and colours used, the more blurred and subdued the tartan's pattern becomes.<ref name="scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames"/><ref name="BanksdelaChapelle--61">Banks; de la Chapelle (2007), p. 61.</ref>

The sequence of threads, known as the sett, starts at an edge and either repeats or reverses on what are called ''pivot'' points. In ''diagram A'', the sett reverses at the first pivot, then repeats, then reverses at the next pivot, and will carry on in this manner horizontally. In ''diagram B'', the sett reverses and repeats in the same way as the warp, and also carries on in the same manner vertically. The diagrams left illustrate the construction of a "symmetrical" tartan. However, on an "asymmetrical" tartan, the sett does not reverse at the pivots, it just repeats at the pivots. Also, some tartans (very few) do not have the exact same sett for the warp and weft. This means the warp and weft will have alternate ''thread counts''.

Tartan is recorded by counting the threads of each colour that appear in the sett.{{#tag:ref|Early collectors of tartan recorded setts by measuring the width of each stripe in one eighths of an inch.<ref name="tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount"/>|group=note}} The ''thread count'' not only describes the width of the stripes on a sett, but also the colours used. For example, the thread count "K4 R24 K24 Y4" corresponds to 4 ''black'' threads, 24 ''red'' threads, 24 ''black'' threads, 4 ''yellow'' threads.<ref name="tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount"/> The first and last threads of the thread count are the pivot points.<ref name="tartangenerator.com--construction"/> Though thread counts are indeed quite specific, they can to be modified in certain circumstances, depending on the desired size of the tartan. For example, the sett of a tartan (about 6 inches) may be too large to fit upon the face of a [[neck tie]]. In this case the thread count has to be reduced ''in proportion'' (about 3 inches).<ref name="tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount">{{cite web |url=http://www.tartansauthority.com/Web/Site/Tartan/Designing/WhatsAThreadcount.asp |title=What's a Threadcount |accessdate=2008-10-16 |work=[[Scottish Tartans Authority]] (tartansauthority.com)}}</ref>

===Colour: shades and meaning===

The shades of colour in tartan can be altered to produce variations of the same tartan. The resulting variations are termed: ''modern'', ''ancient'', and ''muted''. These terms refer to colour only. ''Modern'' represents a tartan that is coloured using chemical dye, as opposed to natural dye. In the mid-19th century natural dyes began to be replaced by chemical dyes which were easier to use and were more economic for the booming tartan industry. Chemical dyes tended to produce a very strong, dark colour compared to the natural dyes. In ''modern'' colours, setts made up of blue, black and green tend be obscured. ''Ancient'' refers to a lighter shade of tartan. This shade is supposed to represent the colours that would be obtained by using natural dyes. ''Muted'' refers to tartan which is shade between ''modern'' and ''ancient''. This type of tartan is very modern, dating only from the early 1970s. This shade is said to be the closest match to the shades attained by natural dyes used before the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tartansauthority.com/Web/Site/Tartan/Dyeing/UseOfColour.asp |title=The Use of Colour in Tartan |author=MacDonald, Peter Eslea |accessdate=2008-10-22 |work=[[Scottish Tartans Authority]] (tartansauthority.com)}}</ref>

The idea that the various colours used in tartan have a specific meaning is purely a modern one. One such myth is that red tartans were "battle tartans", designed so they would not show blood. Many recently created tartans, such as Canadian [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial and territorial]] tartans and American state tartans, are designed with certain symbolic meaning for the colours used. For example the colour ''green'' sometimes symbolises [[prairie]]s or forests, ''blue'' can symbolise lakes and rivers, and the colour ''yellow'' is sometimes used to symbolise various [[Crop (agriculture)|crops]].<ref name="MacDonald1995--48"/>

===Origins===

Today tartan may be mostly associated with Scotland, however the earliest evidence of tartan is found far afield from the British Isles. According to the textile historian E. J. W. Barber, the [[Hallstatt culture]], which flourished between 100 BC to 400 BC, produced tartan-like textiles, some of which were recently discovered, remarkably preserved in [[Salzburg]], Austria.<ref name="BanksdelaChapelle--57"/> Also, textile analysis of fabric from [[Indo-European people|Indo-European]] [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] graves in Western China has shown it to be similar to the [[Iron Age]] Hallstatt culture of central Europe.<ref>Fortson (2004), p. 352.</ref> Tartan-like leggings were found on the "Cherchen Man", a 3,000 year-old [[mummy]], found in the [[Taklamakan Desert]] in western China (see [[Tarim mummies]]).<ref>{{cite news |first=Clifford |last=Coonan |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=A meeting of civilisations: The mystery of China's celtic mummies |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/a-meeting-of-civilisations-the-mystery-of-chinas-celtic-mummies-413638.html |work=[[The Independent]] (independent.co.uk) |date=2006-08-28 |accessdate=2008-10-11 }}</ref> Similar finds have been found in central Europe and Scandinavia.<ref name="scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/committees/enterprise/inquiries/tartan/tartan-ScarlettJames.pdf |title=Submission From James D Scarlett |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-10-12 |work=[[The Scottish Parliament]] (scottish.parliament.uk)}}</ref> The earliest documented tartan in Britain, known as the ''Falkirk'' tartan, dates from the 3rd century AD. It was uncovered at [[Falkirk]] in [[Stirlingshire]], Scotland, about 400 metres north-west of the [[Antonine Wall]]. The fragment was stuffed into the mouth of the earthenware pot containing almost 2,000 Roman coins. The Falkirk tartan is simple check design, of natural light and dark wool. Early forms of tartan such as this are thought to have been invented in pre-Roman times, and would have been popular among the inhabitants of the northern [[Roman provinces]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish-tartans-world-register.com/tartan.aspx?record=1253 |title=Tartan - Shepherd/Falkirk |accessdate=2008-10-08 |work=[[Scottish Tartans World Register]] (scottish-tartans-world-register.com)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/results.php?PHPSESSID=hs2cdr8p86v5er17iuunr0hj36&PHPSESSID=hs2cdr8p86v5er17iuunr0hj36&QUICKSEARCH=1&search_term=falkirk+tartan |title=Search Results (falkirk tartan) |accessdate=2008-10-08 |work=[[National Museums of Scotland]] (nms.ac.uk)}}</ref> 
[[Image:Mosman; John Campbell 1749.jpg|thumb|left|John Campbell of the Bank, 1749. The present official [[Clan Campbell]] tartans are green.]]
Tartan, as we know it today, is not thought to have existed in Scotland before the 16th century. By the late 16th century there are numerous references to striped or checkered plaids. It isn't until the late 17th or early 18th century that any kind uniformity in tartan is thought to have occurred.<ref>Banks; de la Chapelle (2007), pp. 66-67.</ref> [[Martin Martin]], in his ''A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland'' published in 1703, wrote that Scottish tartans could be used to distinguish the inhabitants of different regions. He expressly wrote that the inhabitants of various islands and the mainland of the highlands were not all dressed alike, but that the setts and colours of the various tartans varied from isle to isle.{{#tag:ref|[[Martin Martin]] wrote: "each each Isle differs from the other in thir fancy of making Plaids, as to the Stripes in Breadth and Colours. this Humour is as different thro the main Land of the Highlands, in so-far that they who have seen these Places are able, at the first view of a Man's Plaid to guess the Place of his Residence..."<ref>Banks; de la Chapelle (2007), pp. 65-66. Banks and de la Chapelle cite this quotation from Scarlett, James D. ''Tartan, The Highland Textile'', p. 12.</ref>|group=note}} As he does not mention the use of a special pattern by each family, it would appear that such a distinction is a modern one, and taken from the ancient custom of a tartan for each district, the family or clan in each district originally the most numerous in each part, eventually adopting as their distinctive clan tartan, the tartan of such district. 

For many centuries, the patterns were loosely associated with the weavers of a particular area, though it was common for [[Scottish Highlands|highlanders]] to wear a number of different tartans at the same time.  A 1587 charter granted to Hector [[Clan Maclean|Maclean]] of [[Duart Castle|Duart]] requires [[feu duty]] on land paid as 60 [[ell]]s of cloth of white, black and green colours. A witness of the 1689 [[Battle of Killiecrankie]] describes "[[Glengarry|McDonnell]]'s men in their triple stripes". From 1725 the government force of the ''Highland Independent Companies'' introduced a standardised tartan chosen to avoid association with any particular [[Scottish Clan|clan]], and this was formalised when they became the [[Black Watch]] regiment in 1739.
[[Image:Tartan Ribbon.jpg|thumb|right|The world's first [[colour photography|colour photograph]], made by the Scottish scientist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1861, was of a tartan ribbon.<ref>Jacobson et al. (2000), p. 228.</ref>]]
The most effective fighters for [[Jacobitism]] were the supporting [[Scottish clan]]s, leading to an association of tartans with the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause. Efforts to pacify the Highlands led to the 1746 [[Dress Act]] banning tartans with exemptions for the military and the gentry. Soon after the Act was repealed in 1782 [[Highland Society|Highland Societies]] of landowners were  promoting "the general use of the ancient Highland dress". William Wilson & Sons of [[Bannockburn]] became the foremost weaving manufacturer around 1770 as suppliers of tartan to the military. Wilson corresponded with his agents in the highlands to get information and samples of cloth from the clan districts to enable him to reproduce "perfectly genuine patterns" and recorded over 200 setts by 1822, many of which were tentatively named. The [[Cockburn Collection]] of named samples made by Wilsons was put together between 1810 and 1820 and is now in the [[Mitchell Library]] in [[Glasgow]]. At this time many setts were simply numbered, or given fanciful names such as the "[[Robin Hood]]" tartan.

By the 19th century the Highland romantic revival inspired by [[James Macpherson]]'s [[Ossian]] poems and the writings of [[Walter Scott]] led to wider interest, with clubs like the [[Celtic Society of Edinburgh]] welcoming Lowlanders. The pageantry invented for the 1822 [[visit of King George IV to Scotland]] brought a sudden demand for tartan cloth and made it the [[national dress]] of the whole of Scotland rather than just the highlands and islands, with the invention of many new clan-specific tartans to suit.

===Royal patronage and the tartan craze===

{{see|Visit of King George IV to Scotland}}
The popularity of tartan was greatly increased by the [[Visit of King George IV to Scotland|royal visit of George IV to Edinburgh in 1822]]. George IV was the first reigning monarch to visit Scotland in 171 years.<ref name="monc--HistoryofTartan">Moncreiffe of that Ilk (1967), p. 24.</ref> The festivities surrounding the event were originated by Sir Walter Scott who founded the Celtic Society of Edinburgh in 1820. Scott and Celtic Society members urged Scots to attend festivities "all plaided and plumed in their tartan array".<ref name="Magnusson--653-654"/> One contemporary writer sarcastically described the pomp that surrounded the celebrations as "Sir Walter's Celtified Pagentry".<ref name="Magnusson--653-654">Magnusson (2003), pp. 653-654.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Duncan, Ian |title=Scott's Shadow: The Novel in Romantic Edinburgh |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2007|isbn=0691043833|pages=7<U+2013>8}}</ref>

Following the Royal visit several books which documented tartans added to the craze. James Logan's romanticised work ''The Scottish Gael'', published in 1831, was one such publication which led the Scottish tartan industry to invent clan tartans.<ref name="BanksdelaChapelle--106-108"/> The first publication showing plates of clan tartans was the ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]'' published in 1842.<ref name="scottishtartans.co.uk--history">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishtartans.co.uk/history.htm |title=A Short History of Tartan |author=MacDonald, Peter |accessdate=2008-10-07 |work=Peter MacDonald Tartan Design & Consultancy (scottishtartans.co.uk)}}</ref> The ''Vestiarium'' was the work of two brothers: John Sobieski and Charles Allen Hay. The brothers, who called themselves ''John Sobieski Stolberg Stuart'' and ''Charles Edward Stuart'', first appeared in Scotland in 1822. The two claimed to be grandsons of Prince Charles Edward Stuart and his wife [[Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern|Princess Louise of Stolberg]], and consequence later became known as the "[[Sobieski Stuarts]]". The Sobieski Stuarts claimed that the ''Vestiarium'' was based upon a copy of an ancient manuscript on clan tartans&mdash;a manuscript which they never managed to produce.<ref name="tartansauthority.com--HistoryofTartan">{{cite web |url=http://www.tartansauthority.com/Web/Site/Tartan/History/HistoryofTartan.asp |title=History of Tartan |author=Wilton, Brian|accessdate=2008-10-06 |work=[[Scottish Tartans Authority]] (tartansauthority.com)}}</ref> The ''Vestiarium'' was followed by equally dubious ''The Costume of the Clans'', two years later.<ref name="BanksdelaChapelle--106-108">Banks; de la Chapelle (2007), pp. 106-108.</ref> The romantic enthusiasm that that Logan and the Sobieski Stuarts generated with their publications led the way other tartan books in the 19th century.<ref name="Magnusson--653-654"/><ref name="scottishtartans.co.uk--history"/>

Just twenty years after her uncle's visit to Scotland, [[Queen Victoria]] and her husband [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] made their first trip to the Scottish Highlands. The queen and prince bought [[Balmoral Castle]] in 1848 and hired a local architect to re-model the estate in "[[Scottish baronial style|Scots Baronial]]" style. Prince Albert personally took care of the interior design, where he made great use of tartan. He utilised the red ''Royal Stewart'' and the green ''Hunting Stewart'' tartans for carpets, while using the ''Dress Stewart'' for curtains and upholstery. The queen designed the ''Victoria'', and the prince was the designer of the ''Balmoral'' tartan which still is used today as a royal tartan. Victoria and Albert spent a considerable amount of time at their estate, and in doing so hosted many "Highland" activities. Victoria was attended by pipers and her children were attired in [[Highland dress]]. Prince Albert himself loved watching the [[Highland games]].<ref name="BanksdelaChapelle--108-109">Banks; de la Chapelle (2007), pp. 108-109.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Queen Victoria wrote of her time in Scotland: "Yes; and I feel a sort of reverance in going over these scenes in this most beutaful country, which I am proud to call my own, where there was such devoted loyalty to the family of my ancestors - for [[House of Stuart|Stuart blood]] is in my veins, and I am now their representative, and the people as devoted and loyal to me as they were that unhappy race".<ref>Victoria (1885), p. 173.</ref>|group=note}} Ironically as the craze swept over Scotland, the Highland population suffered grievously from the [[Highland Clearances]]. While thousands of Gaelic speaking Scots from the Highlands and Isles were evicted by landlords (in many cases the very men who would have been their own clan chiefs) to make room for sheep.<ref name="Magnusson--653-654"/>

==Clan tartans==
[[Image:The Battle of Culloden.jpg|thumb|David Morier's ''An incident in the rebellion of 1745''. The eight featured highlanders in the painting wear over twenty different tartans.<ref>Banks; de la Chapelle (2007), p. 84.</ref>]]

It is generally regarded that "clan tartans" date no earlier than the beginning of the 19th century. It is maintained by many that clan tartans were not in use at the time of the Battle of Culloden in 1746. The method of identifying friend from foe was not through tartans but by the colour of ribbon worn upon the [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]].{{#tag:ref|James Ray who served in the government forces at the Battle of Culloden, wrote in 1752: "In their flight I came up with a pretty young Highlander, who called out to me, Hold your Hand, I'm a Cambell. On which I asked him, Where's your Bonnet ? He reply'd, Somebody have snatched it off my Head. I only mention this to shew how we distinguished our loyal Clans from the Rebels ; they being dress'd and equip'd all in one Way, except the Bonnet ; ours having a red or yellow Cross of Cloath or Ribbon ; theirs a white Cockade".<ref>Ray (1752), p. 344.</ref>|group=note}}{{#tag:ref|Kass McGann, citing ''A Journal of the Expedition of Prince Charles Edward in 1745, by a Highland Officer'' which states: "We M<U+2019>Donalds were much preplex<U+2019>d, in the event of ane ingagement, how to distinguish ourselves from our bretheren and nighbours the M<U+2019>Donalds of Sky, seeing we were both Highlanders and both wore heather in our bonnets, only our white cockades made some distinction", claims that this further supports the thought that the idea of clan tartans is a late invention.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reconstructinghistory.com//index.php?s=&c=8&d=117&e=&f=&g=&a=133&w=2 |title=The Evolution of the Kilt -- The Question of Clan Tartans |author=McGann, Kass|date=2003|accessdate=2008-10-06 |work=ReconstructingHistory (reconstructinghistory.com)}}</ref>|group=note}} David Morier's well-known painting of the Highland charge at the battle shows the clansman wearing various tartans. The setts painted all differ from one another and very few of the those painted show any resemblance to today's clan tartans.<ref name="Campbell--259261"/> Contemporary portraits show that although tartan is of an early date, the pattern worn depended not on the wearer's clan, but upon his or her location, or personal taste. The idea of groups of men wearing the same tartan is thought to originate from the military units in the 18th century. Evidence suggests that in 1725 the Independant Highland Companies may have worn a uniform tartan.<ref name="Campbell--259261"/>

The naming and registration of official clan tartans began on [[April 8]], [[1815]], when the [[Highland Society of London]] (founded 1778) resolved that all the clan chiefs each "be respectfully solicited to furnish the Society with as Much of the Tartan of his Lordship's Clan as will serve to Show the Pattern and to Authenticate the Same by Attaching Thereunto a Card bearing the Impression of his Lordship's Arms." Many had no idea of what their tartan might be, but were keen to comply and to provide authentic signed and sealed samples. Alexander Macdonald, 2nd [[Baron Macdonald]] of Sleat was so far removed from his Highland heritage that he wrote to the Society: "Being really ignorant of what is exactly The Macdonald Tartan, I request you will have the goodness to exert every Means in your power to Obtain a perfectly genuine Pattern, Such as Will Warrant me in Authenticating it with my Arms."

Today tartan and "clan tartan" is an important part of a Scottish clan. Almost all Scottish clans have several tartans attributed to their name. Several clans have "official" tartans. Although it is possible for anyone to create a tartan and name it any name they wish, the only person with the authority to make a clan's tartan "official" is the chief.{{#tag:ref|Although there are many tartans attributed to the Campbells, and many tartans named ''Campbell'', there are only four tartans recognised by the current chief as [[Clan Campbell]] tartans: ''Campbell'' (aka ''Black Watch''), ''Campbell of Breadalbane'', ''Campbell of Cawdor'', and ''Campbell of Loudoun''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccsna.org/jsep50a.htm |title=Which are the authentic Campbell tartans? |accessdate=2008-10-09 |work=The Clan Campbell Society (North America) (ccsna.org)}}</ref>|group=note}} In some cases, following such recognition from the clan chief, the clan tartan is recorded and registered by the Lord Lyon King of Arms. Once approved by the Lord Lyon, after recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Tartan, the clan tartan is then recorded in the Lyon Court Books.<ref name="Campbell--259261">Campbell of Airds (2000), pp. 259-261.</ref> In at least one instance a clan tartan appears in the heraldry of a clan chief and is considered by the Lord Lyon as the "proper" tartan of the clan.{{#tag:ref|The crest of the chief of [[Clan MacLennan]] is ''A demi-piper all Proper, garbed in the proper tartan of the Clan Maclennan''.<ref>Way of Plean; Squire (2000), p. 214.</ref> Note the highland MacLennans use the same tartan as the lowland [[Clan Logan|Logans]]. Clan Logan is currently without a chief.|group=note}}

==Other tartans==
[[Image:Black Watch or Campbell tartan.png|thumb|right|The [[Black Watch]] tartan, also known as the "Government sett", or the Campbell tartan. The tartan was used, and is in current use, by several military units throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].<ref>http://www.regiments.org/tradition/tartans/govermt.htm Retrieved on [[August 11]] [[2007]]</ref>]]

[[Image:Northumbrian tartan.png|thumb|right| [[Northumbrian tartan]], one of the earliest known tartans.]]

In addition to the clan tartans, there are many tartans registered for families, districts, institutions and even specific commemorative "memorials" for events or persons. Further, tradition reserves some patterns for use by Scottish Highland military units of the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.

Those units associated with the [[British Royal Family]] use the [[Royal Stewart Tartan]] regardless of whether they are affiliated by blood to the Stewart clan.  This is because of the Royal Family's [[House of Stuart|Stewart]] ancestry through [[James VI of Scotland]]. The Royal family themselves use the [[Balmoral]] tartan.
However tartan is pretty inclusive.  There are tartans for military forces like the [[Royal Air Force]] & [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], commercial companies, special interest groups like [[Amnesty International]], religious movements (including [[Hare Krishna]]), cities, football clubs (including non-UK football clubs like [[Hammarby IF]][http://www.tartans.scotland.net/tartan_info.cfm@tartan_id=3941.htm][http://www.hammarbyklanen.se/]), dancing and whisky-drinking societies, non-British Celtic groups such as French Bretons and Spanish Galicians, commemorations and regions of the world where people of the Scottish [[Diaspora]] live. 
Members of various non-Scottish ethnic groups living in Scotland have developed their own tartans, including Scotland's [[Jewish tartan|Jewish]], [[Sikh]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] communities.<ref name="forw">[http://www.forward.com/articles/13787/ Schwartzapfel, Beth.

In [[Canada]] all [[Canadian province|provinces]] have an [[Official tartans in Canada|official tartan]].

[[British Airways]] used a tartan design as part of its [[British Airways ethnic liveries|ethnic tailfin]] rebranding. This design, Benyhone or "Mountain of the birds," was one of the most widely used designs, being applied to 27 aircraft of the BA fleet.

The Clergy are the only profession represented by a separate tartan. The legend that goes along with this is that they needed a separate tartan to wear instead of their own family's so that they would not be attacked by members of their new congregations who were feuding with their clan.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

In the Celtic regions of [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]], [[Brittany]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] tartans and kilts have been adopted as part of the 19th and 20th century Celtic revival. In [[Ireland]], tartans date back to the 1600s and every county in Ireland has its own tartan design as well as family clans having their own particular tartan.

Tartan is sometimes differentiated from another with the same name by the label ''dress'' or ''hunting''. Dress tartans are based on the ''earasaid'' tartans worn by Highland women in the 17th and 18th centuries.{{#tag:ref|The [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''earasaid'' refers to a [[shawl]]<U+2014>in this case a tartan shawl<U+2014>worn by women.<ref>MacBain (1911), p. 151.</ref>|group=note}} Dress tartans tend to be made by replacing a prominent colour with the colour white. They are commonly used today in Highland dancing. Hunting tartans are also a Victorian conception.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tartans.scotland.net/tartan_types/hunting.cfm.htm |title=Hunting Tartans |accessdate=2008-10-20 |work=Tartans of Scotland (tartans.scotland.net) }}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Even so, the 16th century historian, [[George Buchanan]] wrote: "They delight in variegated garments, especially striped, and their favorite colours are purple and blue. Their ancestors wore plaids of many different colours and numbers still retain this custom, but the majority, now, in their dress, prefer a dark brown, imitating nearly the leaves of heather; than when lying upon the heath in the day, they may not be discovered by the appearance of their clothes".<ref>Banks; de la Chapelle (2007), p. 68. Banks and de la Chapelle cite this quotation from Grant, I. F.; Cheape, Hugh ''Periods in Highland History''. New York: Barnes & Noble. p. 8.</ref>|group=note}} These tartans tend to be made up of subdued colours, such as dark blues and greens. Despite the name, hunting tartans have very little to do with actual hunting.<ref name="scottishtartans.org--faq"/> Mourning tartans, though quite rare, are associated with death and funerals. They are usually designed using combinations of black and white.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tartans.scotland.net/tartan_types/mourning.cfm.htm |title=Mourning Tartans |accessdate=2008-10-20 |work=Tartans of Scotland (tartans.scotland.net) }}</ref> 

Clever Victorian entrepreneurs not only created new tartans, but new tartan objects called ''tartanware''. Tartan was incorporated into an assortment of common household objects such as [[snuffbox]]es, jewellery cases, tableware, sewing accessories, and desk items. Tourists visiting the Scottish Highlands came home with it, and Scottish-based businesses sent tartanware out as gifts to customers. Some of the more popular tartans were the ''Stewart'', ''McDonald'', ''McGregor'', ''McDuff'', ''MacBeth'' and ''Prince Charlie''.<ref name="BanksdelaChapelle--21-22">Banks; de la Chapelle (2007), pp. 21-22.</ref> Today tartanware is widely collected in England and Scotland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coastalantiques.com/archives/december2003/ANTtartan.html |title=19th-century Scottish kitch is today's collectible: Collecting tartanware |accessdate=2008-10-25 |work=Coastal Antiques & Art (coastalantiques.com) }}</ref>

===Tartan in fashion===

In the Victorian and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] eras, tartan-clad garments featured in fashion catalogues. By then, tartan had shifted from being mainly a component of men's clothing to become an important part of women's fashion. In consequence of its association with the British aristocracy and military, tartan developed an air of dignity and exclusivity. Because of this, tartan has made reappearances in the world of fashion several times. For instance, tartan made a resurgence in its use in [[Punk fashion]]. In the late 1970s [[punk music]] was a way for youth in the British Isles to voice their discontent with the [[ruling class]]. The unorthodox use of tartan, which had long been associated with authority and [[Gentry|gentility]], was then seen as the expression of discontent against modern society. In this way tartan, worn unconventionally, became an [[anti-establishment]] symbol.<ref name="BanksdelaChapelle--26-27">Banks; de la Chapelle (2007), pp. 26-27.</ref><ref name="AshWright--63">Ash; Wright (1988), p. 63.</ref>

[[The Scottish Register of Tartans]] is Scotland's official register of tartan. The Register is maintained and administrated by the [[National Archives of Scotland]] based in [[Edinburgh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/aboutUs.aspx|title=About Us|accessdate=8 February 2009|work=The Scottish Register of Tartans (www.tartanregister.gov.uk)}}</ref> The aim of the Register is to provide a definitive and accessible resource to promote and preserve tartan. It also aims to be the definitive source for the registration of new tartans. The register itself is made up of the existing registers of the STA and the STWR and new registrations from February 5, 2009, and on. On the Registers's website users can register new tartans, search for and request the threadcounts of existing tartans and receive notifications of newly registered tartans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/index.aspx|title=Home|accessdate=8 February 2009|work=The Scottish Register of Tartans (www.tartanregister.gov.uk)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/guidance.aspx|title=Guidance|accessdate=8 February 2009|work=The Scottish Register of Tartans (www.tartanregister.gov.uk)}}</ref>

==The 'right' or 'entitlement' to tartan==
Many people only own tartan to which they feel they are associated with, be it through a clan, family, surname or military unit. Others choose their tartan only out of personal taste. Since the [[Victorian era]] 'authorities' on tartan have claimed that there is an [[etiquette]] to wearing tartan, specifically tartan attributed to clans or families. This concept of the 'entitlement' to certain tartans has led to the term of ''universal tartan'', or ''free tartan'', which describes tartan which, in the opinion of some, can be worn by anyone. Traditional examples of such are the ''Black Watch'' (also known as ''Government'', ''Universal'', and ''Campbell''), ''Caledonian'', ''Hunting Stewart'', and ''Jacobite'' tartans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tartans.scotland.net/tartan_types/universal.cfm.htm |title=Universal Tartans |accessdate=2008-10-18 |work=Tartans of Scotland (tartans.scotland.net) }}</ref> In the same line of opinion, some tartan attributed to the [[British Royal Family]] are claimed by some to be 'off limits' to non-royals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tartans.scotland.net/tartan_types/royal.cfm.htm |title=Royal Tartans |accessdate=2008-10-18 |work=Tartans of Scotland (tartans.scotland.net) }}</ref> Even so, there are no rules on who can, or cannot, wear a particular tartan. Note that some modern tartans are [[patent]]ed and protected by [[trademark]], and cannot be sold or appropriated.<ref name="MacDonald1995--48">MacDonald (1995), p. 48.</ref> An example of one such tartan is the ''Burberry Check''.{{#tag:ref|In 2003 [[Burberry]] demanded members of the tartan industry to stop trading a certain ''Camel Thompson'' tartan.<ref name="findarticles.com--ai_n12582587"/> Burberry claimed this tartan, which dates from 1906, was so similar to their ''Burberry Check'' that it infringed on their copyright.<ref name="findarticles.com--ai_n12582587">{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20030518/ai_n12582587 |title=Fashion giant Burberry tries to kill off traditional tartan rival |accessdate= |accessmonthday= |accessdaymonth= |accessyear= |author= |last=McDougall |first=Liam |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2003-05-13 |work= (findarticles.com) }} This article was originally published in the [[Sunday Herald]].</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish-tartans-world-register.com/tartan.aspx?record=2420 |title=Tartan - Thompson/Thomson/MacTavish camel |accessdate=2008-10-18 |work=[[Scottish Tartans World Register]] (scottish-tartans-world-register.com) }}</ref>|group=note}}

Many books on Scottish clans list such rules and guidelines.<ref name="MacDonald1995--48"/> One such opinion is that people not bearing a clan surname, or surname claimed as a sept of a clan, should not wear the tartan of their mother's clan.<ref name="TheScottishClansandTheirTartans14">''The Scottish Clans and Their Tartans'' (2005), p. 14.</ref> This opinion is enforced by the fact that in the Scottish clan system, the Lord Lyon states that membership to a clan technically passes through the surname. This means that children who bear their father's surname belong to the father's clan (if any), and that children who bear their mother's surname (her [[maiden name]]) belong to their mother's clan (if any).<ref name="LyonCourt-leaflet2">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotarmigers.net/leaflet2.htm |title=Information Leaflet No.2 - Scottish Crest Badges |accessdate=2008-07-23 |author=The Court of the Lord Lyon |authorlink=Court of the Lord Lyon |work=The Society of Scottish Armigers (scotarmigers.net)}}</ref> Also, the Lord Lyon states that a clan tartan should only be worn by those who profess allegiance to that clan's chief.<ref name="lyon-court.com--243">{{cite web |url=http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/243.html |title=Tartans |accessdate=2008-10-16 |work=[[The Court of the Lord Lyon]] (lyon-court.com) }}</ref> Some clan societies even claim that certain tartans are the personal property of a chief or chieftain, and in some cases they allow their clansfolk 'permission' to wear a tartan.{{#tag:ref|For example, the Clan Cameron Association website states that the ''Cameron of Lochiel'' tartan "is the personal tartan of the Chief and his immediate family; as a rule it should not be worn by clansfolk".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clan-cameron.org/basics.html |title=The "Basics" of Clan Cameron |accessdate=2008-10-18 |work=Clan Cameron Online (clan-cameron.org) }}</ref>|group=note}} According to the [[Scottish Tartans Authority]]&mdash;which is closely associated with the Scottish tartan industry&mdash;the ''Balmoral'' tartan should not be worn by anyone who is not part of the British Royal Family. Even so, some weavers outside of the [[United Kingdom]] ignore the "longstanding convention" of the British Royal Family's 'right' to this tartan. The society also claims that non-royals who wear this tartan are treated with "great disdain" by the Scottish tartan industry.<ref name="tartansauthority.com--tartanfaqs">{{cite web |url=http://www.tartansauthority.com/Web/Site/FAQs/tartanfaqs.asp |title=Tartan - FAQ |accessdate=2008-10-18 |work=[[Scottish Tartans Authority]] (tartansauthority.com) }}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The only non-royal permitted by the Royal Family to wear the ''Balmoral'' tartan is the Queen's personal piper.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hutcheson, Colin W |url=http://www.tartansauthority.com/Web/Site/Tartan/History/RoyalTartans.asp |title=Royal Tartans |accessdate=2008-10-18 |work=[[Scottish Tartans Authority]] (tartansauthority.com) }}</ref> The official website of the British Monarchy claims the tartan is not available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page3305.asp |title=Piping in the Balmoral Tartan |accessdate=2008-10-20 |work=The official website of the British Monarchy (royal.gov.uk) }}</ref>|group=note}} Generally though, a more [[Liberalism|liberal attitude]] is taken by those in the business of selling tartan, stressing that anyone may wear any tartan they like (besides the ''Balmoral'' of course). In the end though, there are no rules on who can or can not wear a certain tartan.
