==Biography==
Kevin Mitchell often performs his solo work under the pseudonym of '''Bob Evans'''.<ref>[http://www.amo.org.au/artist.asp?id=2341 Bob Evans], Australian Music Online.</ref> He has released two albums under this name. His first was a low key album titled ''[[Suburban Kid]]'', which was released in 2003.  It was released on [[Redline Records]], and was not widely available. Whilst all the tracks were written by Kevin Mitchell, one song, "The Hermit", was co-written by [[Luke Steele (singer)|Luke Steele]] from [[The Sleepy Jackson]]. [[Katy Steele]], from [[Little Birdy]] also performed backup vocals on the album.

The follow-up was released in 2006 and has been titled ''[[Suburban Songbook]]''. It began as a collection of demos that Kevin Mitchell (Evans) recorded with no intention of widely releasing them. However, [[Capitol Records]] discovered them and put into motion the recording of [[Suburban Songbook]] which was released in 2006.  ''[[Suburban Songbook]]'' won the "Best Adult Contemporary Album" and Kevin Mitchell (Bob Evans) was nominated for "Best Male Artist" in the 2006 [[ARIA Awards]]. The album was also nominated for the 2006 [[Australian Music Prize]] and the 2006 [[J Award]].
 
Mitchell supported [[Evermore (band)|Evermore]] on their "Welcome to the Real Life" tour of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] under the Bob Evans pseudonym, and also performed on the 2007 [[Big Day Out]] tour, [[Homebake]], [[West Coast Blues & Roots Festival]] and [[The Great Escape (festival)|The Great Escape]].

At the 2007 [[West Australian Music Industry Awards|Western Australian Music Industry (WAMi) Awards]] he was nominated for two awards, 'Most Popular Album' and 'Best Commercial Pop Act'.

Mitchell was voted 'Best Male Artist' in the 2007 Rolling Stones annual readers poll. He also played showcases in London, New York and [[Johannesburg]] before undertaking a national tour with [[Machine Translations]] and [[Farryl Purkiss]] (South Africa).

<blockquote>
<U+201C>I think Bob Evans is more me than Kevin Mitchell from Jebediah is! In that way it<U+2019>s like a reverse alter-ego. It just allows me to push things a bit. Bob<U+2019>s been enough under the radar to give me, creatively, a lot more freedom than I might otherwise have.<U+201D> Kevin Mitchell <ref>[http://www.bigdayout.com/lineup/artist_popup.php?ArtistId=33 Big Day Out 2006 Artist Profile]</ref>
</blockquote>

When later asked what 'reverse alter-ego' means to Kevin, he said <U+201C>I've no idea, that's one of those quotes that I've been haunted by.<U+201D><ref name="Xdafied">{{cite news| last=Webb | first=Dan | url=http://www.xdafied.com.au/interviews/bobevans.html | publisher=Xdafied.com.au| title=Bob Evans (Kevin Mitchell) Interview| date=[[2007-01-11]] | accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref>

Mitchell has been recording a new album with Jebediah and has also recorded some new songs for his third album, ''Goodnight, Bullcreek'' in Nashville, with producer Brad Jones ([[Sheryl Crowe]], [[Josh Rouse]]). According to Mitchell the album will be the final piece in his suburban musical trilogy.<ref name="Melville">{{cite web|url=http://wwww.communitynews.com.au |title=Goodbye to suburbia|publisher=[[Community Newspapers]] (Melville Times)|last=McRae|first=Ross|date=2008-11-25|accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref>

{{quote|The title is referring to me saying farewells, as I said with the last record that I would only do one more suburban record as part of the trilogy.  Ironically, this record isn't very suburban at all though; not nearly as much as the last one.  But it is the end of the chapter.|Kevin Mitchell<ref name="Melville"/>}}

Mitchell has confirmed that he is still very much involved with his band, Jebediah.

{{quote|People have said that because the last Bob record did quite well that I am now bigger than Jebediah, but it is not exactly the case. Jebediah is still able to do things that I can't do as a solo performer. They are two different things and it can be a bit of a juggling act.  I am still waiting for the day when I rock up to a Jebediah gig with my acoustic guitar or turn up to a Bob Evans gig with my amplifier, and realise I have brought the wrong equipment.|Kevin Mitchell<ref name="Melville"/>}}

Mitchell has announced a national tour to promote the release of the album in April, 2009. He will be joined by Malcolm Clark ([[Sleepy Jackson]]), Hugh Jennings ([[End of Fashion]]), Ben Witt ([[The Chemist]]), Louis Macklin ([[67 Special]]) and [[Steve Poltz]] ([[The Rugburns]]) from the United States.
