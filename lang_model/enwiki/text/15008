'''Rachel Louise Bradley''' is a fictional character portrayed by [[Helen Baxendale]] in the British [[comedy-drama]] television series ''[[Cold Feet]]''. Rachel is introduced in [[Pilot (Cold Feet)|the pilot episode]] (1997), where she begins a relationship with Adam Williams ([[James Nesbitt]]). Their relationship has highs and lows throughout the series; Rachel reveals a secret husband in the first series (1998) and has an abortion in the second (1999), which supposedly prevents her from conceiving a child in the future. She and Adam marry in the third series (2000) and are surprised to discover that she is pregnant in the fourth (2001). They both begin raising their child in the fifth series (2003), but Rachel's life is cut short when she is killed in a car crash.

The character was originally devised as "the fantasy girlfriend", and was constructed as an amalgamation of writer [[Mike Bullen]]'s female friends. As the series was developed, input into Rachel's storylines was provided by ''Cold Feet''{{'}}s producers [[Andy Harries]] and [[Christine Langan]]; Rachel and Adam attempt [[in vitro fertilisation]] in the third series, which Harries and his wife had also tried. It was originally planned for Rachel and Adam to adopt a child during the third series, but Helen Baxendale's real-life pregnancy meant the storyline had to be rewritten.

Both character and actress received mixed reviews from critics throughout the series; Baxendale received the Best Actress award from the [[Broadcasting Press Guild]] for her portrayal of Rachel in the pilot and was nominated for a [[British Comedy Award]]. However, television reviewers criticised the character when the series began. Rachel's diagnosis with [[Asherman's syndrome]] in the fourth series drew criticism from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, which had been consulted during the writing of the storyline. When the series ended, there was a 20% increase in the number of people taking out life insurance policies with one provider, which was attributed to Rachel's premature death.

== Creation and backstory ==
[[File:Helen Baxendale.jpg|thumb|upright|Helen Baxendale played Rachel Bradley for all five series of ''Cold Feet'']]
Rachel Bradley was devised by writer [[Mike Bullen]] as one of the two central characters in the [[Pilot (Cold Feet)|pilot episode]] of ''Cold Feet'', the other being Adam Williams. Bullen conceived her as "the fantasy girlfriend" by incorporating elements of a man's perfect girlfriend, such as actress [[Cameron Diaz]]. He also incorporated elements of a female friend whom he had known since the age of four.<ref>Powell, Adam (23 December 2000). "Meet the real life friends who inspired Cold Feet". ''Daily Mail'' (Associated Newspapers): pp.&nbsp;50<U+2013>51.</ref>

[[Helen Baxendale]], then popularly known for her starring role as Dr Claire Maitland in the BBC medical drama ''[[Cardiac Arrest (TV series)|Cardiac Arrest]]'', became available halfway through the casting process of the pilot, and was invited to audition. Baxendale was initially reluctant to read for the role, as she believed that she would not be able to give a good comic performance. Executive producer [[Andy Harries]] persuaded her that she had already performed black comedy in ''Cardiac Arrest'', and so would be well-suited to the part of Rachel.<ref>Tibballs, p.&nbsp;9.</ref> Producer [[Christine Langan]] described Baxendale as "perfect for the idolized Rachel" and her reading with Nesbitt as having "unmistakable chemistry".<ref>Tibballs, p.&nbsp;12.</ref> [[Hermione Norris]] also auditioned for the role, but Baxendale was eventually cast.<ref>Tibballs, p.&nbsp;10.</ref> By the time of the third series, Baxendale's initial concerns had gone and she felt comfortable acting with the comic actors.<ref>Ross, Peter (22 October 2000). "No mean feet". ''The Sunday Herald'' (Scottish Media Newspapers) ([http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20001022/ai_n13954999/ archived] at findarticles.com).</ref> Speaking retrospectively, she found Rachel difficult to play:

<blockquote>I was playing the nice girl. It's really hard to play. All the other characters came from somebody and I said to Mike [the writer], 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I found it hard to make anything of that. In the end I felt the only thing I could do was to make it as hyper real as I could. I'm not a natural comedienne.<ref>Brockes, Emma (28 November 2003). "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2003/nov/28/theatre2 'I don't feel like a drip']". ''The Guardian'' (Guardian News & Media): p.&nbsp;4 (''G2'' section).</ref></blockquote>

The character's backstory was presented in ''Cold Feet: A Man's/Woman's Guide to Life'', which was compiled by Jonathan Rice from Mike Bullen's scripts. Rachel read French at the [[University of Manchester]], then spent a season working as a chalet girl in the [[French Alps]]. There she met Karen (Hermione Norris) who became her best friend. When both returned to England, Karen married David Marsden ([[Robert Bathurst]]) and Rachel began a career in the advertising industry.<ref>Rice, Jonathan (1999).

== Character arc ==
=== Relationship with Adam ===
[[File:James Nesbitt 2009 BAFTAs2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|In the pilot, Rachel begins a relationship with Adam, played by [[James Nesbitt]] ]]
At the beginning of [[Pilot (Cold Feet)|the pilot episode]], Rachel is dumped by her boyfriend Simon Atkinson (Stephen Mapes), who has recently taken a job in [[Hong Kong]] and does not want to "burden" Rachel with deciding whether to emigrate with him. Shortly afterwards, her car collides with that of Adam Williams on a supermarket car park. The two get into a row over whose fault the crash was and he smoothes things over by giving him her phone number, ostensibly in case there is a problem with the insurance. She writes her number in the muck on his rear windscreen but it later washes off in the rain. Some time later, Rachel's friend Karen advises her to call Adam and go on a date with him. Their first date does not go well, but they see each other again. Three months later, they row, and Rachel gets back together with Simon, who has returned to Hong Kong. Adam wins her back by serenading her while wearing nothing but a rose between his buttocks.<ref>''Cold Feet''. Mike Bullen (writer); Declan Lowney (director). ''Comedy Premieres''. ITV. 30 March 1997.</ref> 

[[Cold Feet (series 1)|The first series]] begins nine months later. Rachel and Adam move into their first house together. He is horrified to discover that she has been married for over six years. She contacts her husband Kris Bumstead ([[Lennie James]]) and after briefly considering going back to him and dumping Adam, she gets the divorce.<ref>Series 1, Episode 2. Mike Bullen (writer); Declan Lowney (director). ''Cold Feet''. ITV. 22 November 1998.</ref> After a misunderstanding with Karen, Rachel worries that Adam has stopped finding her sexually attractive, and they agree to indulge in each other's sexual fantasies. Rachel shares her with Adam: to have sex in a shop window. Adam arranges to get the keys to a shop, and he and Rachel act out her fantasy, though are arrested when a ramraider leads the police to them.<ref>Series 1, Episode 3. Mike Bullen (writer); [[Mark Mylod]] (director). ''Cold Feet''. ITV. 29 November 1998.</ref> 

In [[Cold Feet (series 1)#ep6|Series 1, Episode 6]], Rachel reveals to Karen that she is pregnant, but is unsure whether the father is Adam or Kris, whom she had sex with while he was in Manchester. She devastates Adam by first turning down his proposal of marriage, after he believes he is the father of the child, and then by leaving Manchester on a train. Adam arrives at the station shortly before her train leaves and pledges to love the child regardless of who it's father is. Rachel demonstrates that he does not mean it, and the train departs for [[London]].<ref>Series 1, Episode 6. Mike Bullen (writer); [[Nigel Cole]] (director). ''Cold Feet''.

=== Abortion and infertility ===

Six months later, Rachel returns to Manchester, and moves into Karen and David's spare room. After Pete spots her at the supermarket, Adam prepares for what he thinks will be her homecoming with his child. Instead, Rachel reveals that she had the pregnancy terminated, unable to cope with not knowing whether the father was Adam or Kris.<ref>Series 2, Episode 1. Mike Bullen (writer); [[Tom Hooper (director)|Tom Hooper]] (director). ''Cold Feet''. ITV. 26 September 1999.</ref> The abortion story was devised to avoid having all three couples in the series having children. Bullen and the executive producers Andy Harries and Christine Langan all agreed that having Rachel suffer a miscarriage would be a "cop out" but they split on whether she should terminate the pregnancy; Harries worried about the effect it would have on the character within the narrative, and what the audience would think of her, while Langan convinced him that it would be braver and more realistic for the character to go through with it.<ref>Tibballs, p.&nbsp;125.</ref>

Rachel ponders whether to get back together with Adam but is left humiliated when she arrives at his house in the middle of the night and finds him apparently in the middle of an orgy with his new girlfriend Amy ([[Rosie Cavaliero]]) and lodger "Rachel 2" ([[Rachel Fielding]]).<ref>Series 2, Episode 2.

Now in a committed relationship, Rachel and Adam begin trying for a baby.<ref>Series 3, Episode 1. Mike Bullen (writer); [[Simon Delaney]] (director). ''Cold Feet''. ITV. 12 November 2000.</ref> The storyline was devised because Harries wanted ''Cold Feet'' to reflect relevant issues in contemporary society; [[in vitro fertilisation]] featured heavily in the news during 2000, and Harries felt that incorporating it into the series would help to raise awareness of it, as well as provide fodder for the characters' story arcs.<ref name=Harries/> Rachel's [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] treatment incorporated aspects of the real life IVF treatment experienced by Harries and his wife [[Rebecca Frayn]], and eminent fertility scientist [[Sammy Lee (scientist)|Sammy Lee]] was consulted extensively throughout the development of the plot.<ref name=Harries/> After spending several thousand pounds on IVF treatment, Rachel's doctor informs her that she is infertile due to [[Asherman's syndrome]], most likely caused by her abortion.<ref>Series 3, Episode 4. Mike Bullen (writer); [[Jon Jones (director)|Jon Jones]] (director). ''Cold Feet''. ITV. 26 November 2000.</ref> Despite being unable to have children naturally, Rachel and Adam are determined to continue their relationship; Adam proposes to her and they are married in a civil ceremony in Series 3, Episode 8. In the same episode, she is reunited with her estranged parents, Brian and Mary ([[Paul Ridley]] and [[Sue Holderness]]). Before the episode, Rachel had not spoken to them for years; her father because of his bigotry and abuse of her mother, and her mother for staying with him. She refuses to allow Paul to give her away, and instead asks David to, despite learning that he has been having an extra-marital affair. At the reception, she inadvertently reveals to her parents that her sister, their other daughter Lucy, has come out as a lesbian.<ref>Series 3, Episode 8.

=== Son, death and funeral ===
At the beginning of Series 4, Rachel is broody and upset that she is infertile.<ref>Series 4, Episode 1. Mike Bullen (writer); Tim Whitby (director). ''Cold Feet''. ITV. 18 November 2001.</ref> She and Adam begin an application process for an adoption, and are soon paired up with eight-year-old Laura (Katie Riddoch), the daughter of a drug addict. Adam and Laura bond at their first meeting at her foster home, and Adam and Rachel begin plans for her to move in with them.<ref>Series 4, Episode 4. Mike Bullen and Mark Chappell (writers); [[Paul Kousoulides]] (director). ''Cold Feet''. ITV. 26 November 2001.</ref> However, after a routine hospital appointment reveals that Rachel is four months pregnant, social worker Ruth Wylie ([[Samantha Spiro]]) retracts the adoption application, concerned about the effect a new baby will have on Laura if she moves in with Adam and Rachel. Adam and Rachel vow to take legal action against the adoption agency but change their minds after Laura's foster mother Jean (Jacqueline Pilton) persuades them to think of the effect it will have on Laura. Reluctantly, Adam and Rachel walk away from the adoption and instead plan for their own baby.<ref>Series 4, Episode 5. Mike Bullen (writer); Paul Kousoulides (director). ''Cold Feet''.

On the day of the wedding ceremony, Rachel collapses outside the hotel, having gone into labour two months prematurely, and is rushed to hospital.

ITV. 10 December 2001.</ref>

At the beginning of Series 5, set three months after the birth, Rachel appears overprotective of Matthew; she refuses to let Adam hold him and never lets him out of her sight. After Adam abruptly leaves Matthew's naming ceremony, feeling unable to love his child because he is coming between him and his wife, Rachel reveals that the baby fell off the kitchen table when she left him unattended for a matter of seconds.<ref>Series 5, Episode 1. Mike Bullen (writer); Ciaran Donnelly (director). ''Cold Feet''. ITV. 23 February 2003.</ref> Baxendale said of the story, "Rachel's take on motherhood is quite real in my experience because she's had such trouble conceiving for a start and then all the problems with the birth [...] She becomes obsessed with the baby and excludes Adam from everything. They have to work hard to resolve their differences and there is a big transition. I can see why she behaves the way she does<U+2014>you do become over-protective with a baby. It's amazing what your body does to you and the instincts that suddenly take over. Being a mum myself, I have got real empathy with Rachel."<ref>Hockney, Karen (22 February 2003). "There's a lot of guilt when I have to go away and leave my children". ''Daily Mirror'' (MGN): p.&nbsp;8.</ref> However, ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' television reviewer Kathryn Flett criticised the plot as unrealistic:

<blockquote>As an obsessive new mother who has spent many an hour hovering over my son with a thermometer and a pre-emptive bottle of Calpol, Rachel's contention that she didn't want to go out for dinner with Adam because she couldn't bear to leave three-month-old Matthew in the care of their best friend's children's nanny was just one niggling implausibility too far. After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had ''Cold Feet'' not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.<ref name=Flett>Flett, Kathryn (2 March 2003).

After her revelation to Adam, Rachel is more willing to leave Matthew in some else's care; after her maternity leave ends and she returns to work, Adam looks after Matthew during his period of unemployment.<ref>Series 5, Episode 2.

In 2011, Baxendale told [[Digital Spy]] that she had been involved in discussions with ''Cold Feet''{{'}}s creative staff about how to incorporate Rachel into a possible revival of the series.<ref>Wightman, Catriona (11 January 2011).

== Reception ==
For her performance in the pilot episode, Helen Baxendale was nominated for Top TV Comedy Actress at the [[British Comedy Awards 1997]].<ref>Hughes, Chris (12 December 1997). "Fool's gold". ''The Mirror'' (MGN): p.&nbsp;5.</ref> At the [[Broadcasting Press Guild|Broadcasting Press Guild Awards 1998]], she was presented with the Best Actress award, for her performance in ''Cold Feet'' and ''[[An Unsuitable Job for a Woman]]''.<ref>"[http://www.broadcastingpressguild.org/?page_id=80 1998 Awards]". Broadcasting Press Guild. Retrieved on 14 November 2009.</ref> Her portrayal received mixed reviews from television critics when the series began. In the ''[[Daily Record]]'', Kathleen Morgan wrote that Baxendale had lost her edge since playing Dr Maitland in ''Cardiac Arrest''; "Instead of making a triumphant return to British television as a tough-talking woman, she has been cast as another spineless character."<ref>Morgan, Kathleen (28 November 1998). "Morgan's Vision: Helen's out in the cold". ''Daily Record'' (Scottish Daily Record & Sunday Mail): p.&nbsp;42.</ref> Sara Villiers wrote in ''[[The Scotsman]]'', "Rachel is so unfeasibly bland and nice that she has consigned Baxendale to the title Most Irritating Woman on the Telly."<ref>Villiers, Sara (22 November 1998). "Nightmares for all". ''The Scotsman'' (Scotsman Publications): p.&nbsp;51 (''S'' supplement).</ref>

The plot of Rachel's infertility was analysed on an episode of [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Woman's Hour]]''. [[Ann Furedi]] of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, which had supplied information to the writing team during the research stages, stated that there had not been a recorded case of Asherman's syndrome in the United Kingdom since the second world war. Further to that, she stated that the consensus among medical groups was that there was no real direct link between abortions and infertility; rather an untreated infection could increase the chances of fertility problems if it interfered with an abortion. Christine Geraghty, then senior lecturer in film and TV at [[Goldsmith's College]], countered that the factual accuracy of the storyline depended on how the producers wanted to portray the issue to viewers. Her opinion was backed up by an ITV statement, which said that "stories for ''Cold Feet'' are not just chosen in order to make people aware of the issues involved; they're also chosen for their dramatic potential and relevance to modern living".<ref name="Woman's Hour">Furedi, Ann; Christine Geraghty.

Critics were retrospective of both Rachel and of Baxendale's performance when the series ended. In the ''[[New Statesman]]'', Andrew Billen wrote that Rachel "was as near to a sex symbol as this comedy drama about six cold-footed yuppies produced. She was also materialistic, unfaithful, self-absorbed, tricky and had not the first clue about men [...] Yet her death, caused by a moment of carelessness behind the wheel, was powerful and shocking, a tribute to the extent to which we have invested and believed in her."<ref>Billen, Andrew (24 March 2003). "[http://www.newstatesman.com/200303240035 Couplings and recouplings]". ''New Statesman'': p.&nbsp;47.</ref> ''Observer'' critic Kathryn Flett noted that Baxendale's high profile role in ''[[Friends]]'' made her the "star" of ''Cold Feet'' in the first series, but both she and Rachel had been "eclipsed" by the other actors and characters by the time of the final series.<ref name=Flett/> ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' critic [[Simon Hoggart]] wrote, "I wasn't as sorry about poor old Rachel as I should have been. It was one of those deaths which makes you think, 'Oh, her poor baby boy,' rather than 'Goodness, how we'll miss her.'" Hoggart attributed his ambivalence to Baxendale's portrayal of the character as a "fraught, snippy" woman.<ref>Hoggart, Simon (22 March 2003). "Please come back".
