[[File:Code hays, cover.gif|thumb|200px|Production Code cover.]]
The '''Motion Picture Production Code''' was the set of industry censorship guidelines which governed the production of the vast majority of [[Cinema of the United States|United States motion pictures]] released by major studios from 1930 to 1968. It was originally popularly known as the '''Hays Code''', after its creator, [[Will H. Hays]].

The Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors Association (MPPDA), which later became the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), adopted the code in [[1930 in film|1930]], began effectively enforcing it in [[1934 in film|1934]], and abandoned it in [[1968 in film|1968]] in favor of the subsequent [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA film rating system]]. The Production Code spelled out what was  acceptable and what was unacceptable content for motion pictures produced for a public audience in the United States.

The office enforcing it was originally popularly  called the Breen Office, named after its first administrator, [[Joseph I. Breen]]. 

==Provisions of the Code==
The Production Code enumerated three "General Principles" as follows:

# No picture shall be produced that will lower the moral standards of those who see it. Hence the sympathy of the audience should never be thrown to the side of crime, wrongdoing, evil or sin.
# Correct standards of life, subject only to the requirements of drama and entertainment, shall be presented.
# Law, natural or human, shall not be ridiculed, nor shall sympathy be created for its violation.

Specific restrictions were spelled out as "Particular Applications" of these principles:

* Nakedness and suggestive dances were prohibited.
* The ridicule of religion was forbidden, and ministers of religion were not to be represented as comic characters or villains.
* The depiction of illegal drug use was forbidden, as well as the use of liquor, "when not required by the plot or for proper characterization".
* Methods of crime (e.g. safe-cracking, arson, smuggling) were not to be explicitly presented.
* References to alleged sex perversion (such as homosexuality) and [[venereal disease]] were forbidden, as were depictions of childbirth.
* The language section banned various words and phrases that were considered to be offensive.
* Murder scenes had to be filmed in a way that would discourage imitations in real life, and brutal killings could not be shown in detail. "Revenge in modern times" was not to be justified.
* The sanctity of marriage and the home had to be upheld. "Pictures shall not imply that low forms of sex relationship are the accepted or common thing". [[Adultery]] and illicit sex, although recognized as sometimes necessary to the plot, could not be explicit or justified and were not supposed to be presented as an attractive option.
* Portrayals of [[miscegenation]] were forbidden.
* "Scenes of Passion" were not to be introduced when not essential to the plot. "Excessive and lustful kissing" was to be avoided, along with any other treatment that might "stimulate the lower and baser element".
* The flag of the United States was to be treated respectfully, and the people and history of other nations were to be presented "fairly".
* The treatment of "Vulgarity", defined as "low, disgusting, unpleasant, though not necessarily evil, subjects" must be "subject to the dictates of good taste". [[Capital punishment]], [[Torture|"third-degree methods"]], [[child abuse|cruelty to children]], [[cruelty to animals|animals]], [[prostitution]] and surgical operations were to be handled with similar sensitivity.

==History==
===Before the Production Code===
[[File:Will-H-Hays.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Will H. Hays]]]]
City and state censorship ordinances are as old as the movies themselves.  However, after the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruled in 1915 (''[[Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio]]'') that motion pictures were merely a business and not an art form, and thus not covered by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], such ordinances banning the public exhibition of "immoral" films proliferated.  The [[movie studio]]s feared that federal regulations were not far off.

In the early 1920s, three major scandals rocked Hollywood: the manslaughter trials of comedy star [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle]], who was charged with being responsible for the death of actress [[Virginia Rappe]] at a wild party in San Francisco during [[Labor Day]] weekend of 1921; the murder of director [[William Desmond Taylor]] in February 1922 and the revelations regarding his [[bisexuality]]; and the drug-related death of popular actor [[Wallace Reid]] in January 1923. 

Other allegedly drug-related deaths of stars [[Olive Thomas]], [[Barbara La Marr]], [[Jeanne Eagels]], and [[Alma Rubens]] resulted in persistent calls for censorship and "cleaning up" of Hollywood through the 1920s. These stories were sensationalized in the press and grabbed headlines across the country. They appeared to confirm a widespread perception that many Americans had of Hollywood &mdash; that it was "Sin City".

Public outcry over perceived immorality in Hollywood and the movies, as well as the growing number of city and state censorship boards, led to the creation in [[1922 in film|1922]] of the Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors Association (which became the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] in 1945), an industry trade and lobby organization.  The association was headed by [[Will H. Hays]], a well-connected Republican lawyer who had previously been [[United States Postmaster General]] and the [[U.S. presidential election, 1920|1920]] campaign manager for President [[Warren G. Harding]]. Hays immediately banned Fatty Arbuckle from the movies and instituted a morality clause to apply to anyone working in films.  He also derailed attempts to institute federal censorship over the movies.

In [[1927 in film|1927]] Hays compiled a list of subjects, culled from his experience with the various U.S. censorship boards, which he felt Hollywood studios would be wise to avoid.  He called this list "the formula" but it was popularly known as the "don'ts and be carefuls" list around town.  In 1930 Hays created the Studio Relations Committee (SRC) to implement his censorship code, but the SRC lacked any real enforcement capability.

===1930 to 1934===
The advent of [[Sound film|talking pictures]] in 1927 led to a perceived need for further enforcement. Martin Quigley, the publisher of a Chicago-based motion picture trade newspaper, began lobbying for a more extensive code that not only listed material that was inappropriate for the movies, but also contained a moral system that the movies could help to promote <U+2014> specifically a system based on Catholic theology.<ref>Leff, Leonard J. Dame in the kimono Hollywood, censorship, and the production code from the 1920s to the 1960s. New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1990. Print. pp.9</ref> He recruited Father [[Daniel A. Lord|Daniel Lord]], a [[Jesuit]] priest and instructor at [[Saint Louis University]], to write such a code and on March 31, 1930 the board of directors of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association adopted it formally. This original version became popularly known as the Hays Code, but both it and its subsequent revisions are now generally referred to as the Production Code.

However, Depression economics and changing social mores resulted in the studios producing racier fare that the Code, lacking an aggressive enforcement body, was unable to redress. This era is known as [[Pre-Code Hollywood]].

===Enforcement===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Joan blondell 2.jpg|thumb|160px|Pre-Production Code publicity photo of the popular actress [[Joan Blondell]], apparently nude on a [[Streamline Moderne]] chair.]] -->

In response to such movies as [[Warner Brothers]]' ''[[Baby Face (film)|Baby Face]]'' (starring [[Barbara Stanwyck]]) and [[Paramount Pictures]]' ''[[I'm No Angel]]'' (starring and written by [[Mae West]]), Quigley and [[Joseph I. Breen]], Will Hays's Los Angeles-based assistant, enlisted the Catholic Church to exert pressure on the Hollywood studios. They helped spearhead the creation of the [[National Legion of Decency|Catholic Legion of Decency]] as well as boycotts and blacklists of the movies throughout the country.

An amendment to the Code, adopted on June 13, 1934, established the [[Production Code Administration]] (PCA), and required all films released on or after July 1 {{fy|1934}} to obtain a certificate of approval before being released. The first film to receive an MPPDA seal of approval was ''[[The World Moves On]]''. For more than thirty years following, virtually all motion pictures produced in the United States adhered to the code. <ref name="Doherty">Doherty, Thomas [http://my.brandeis.edu/news/item?news_item_id=105052&show_release_date=1 "The Code Before 'Da Vinci'"] ''[[Washington Post]]'' (May 20, 2006)</ref> The Production Code was not created or enforced by federal, state, or city government. In fact, the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood]] studios adopted the code in large part in the hopes of avoiding government censorship, preferring self-regulation to government regulation.

The enforcement of the Production Code led to the dissolution of many local censorship boards. Meanwhile, the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|U.S. Customs Department]] prohibited the importation of the [[Czechoslovak|Czech]] film ''[[Ecstasy (movie)|Ecstasy]]'' ([[1933 in film|1933]]), starring an actress soon to be known as [[Hedy Lamarr]], an action which was upheld on appeal. 

In 1934, Joseph I. Breen (1888-1965) was appointed head of the new Production Code Administration (PCA). Under Breen's leadership of the PCA, which lasted until his retirement in 1954, enforcement of the Production Code became rigid and notorious. Breen's power to change scripts and scenes angered many writers, directors, and Hollywood [[media proprietor|mogul]]s. The PCA had two offices, one in Hollywood, and the other in New York City. Films approved by the New York PCA office were issued certificate numbers that began with a zero.

Breen influenced the production of ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', objecting to any explicit reference to Rick and Ilsa having slept together in Paris, and to mentioning that Captain Renault extorted sexual favors from his supplicants. However, both remained strongly implied in the finished version.<ref>[http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/censored/film.html Censored Films and Television at University of Virginia online]</ref> Adherence to the code also ruled out in advance any possibility of the film ending with Rick and Ilsa consummating their adulterous love, effectively making inevitable the ending with Rick's noble renunciation, one of ''Casablanca'''s most famous scenes.<ref>Harmetz, pp.162<U+2013>166 and Behlmer, pp.207<U+2013>208 and 212<U+2013>213</ref>

The first major instance of censorship under the Production Code involved the 1934 film ''[[Tarzan and His Mate]]'', in which brief nude scenes involving a body double for actress [[Maureen O'Sullivan]] were edited out of the master negative of the film. Another famous case of enforcement involved the [[1943 in film|1943]] [[western movie|western]] ''[[The Outlaw]]'', produced by [[Howard Hughes]]. ''The Outlaw'' was denied a certificate of approval and kept out of theaters for years because the film's advertising focused particular attention on [[Jane Russell]]'s breasts. Hughes eventually persuaded Breen that the breasts did not violate the code and the film could be shown.  

Some films produced outside the mainstream studio system during this time did flout the conventions of the code, such as ''[[Child Bride]]'' (1938), which featured a nude scene involving 12-year-old actress [[Shirley Mills]]. Even cartoon sex symbol [[Betty Boop]] had to change from being a [[flapper]], and began to wear an old-fashioned housewife skirt.

The Code began to weaken in the late 1940s, when the formerly taboo subjects of rape and [[miscegenation]] were allowed in ''[[Johnny Belinda]]'' (1948) and ''[[Pinky (1949 film)|Pinky]]'' (1949), respectively. ''[[The Moon Is Blue]]'' caused controversy due to director [[Otto Preminger]]'s insistence on keeping "virgin", a word not used in Hollywood films since the early 1930s, in the script. The film eventually was nominated for several Academy Awards. 

====''[[Kings Row]]''====
[[Image:Cummings and Field in Kings Row.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The character of Cassandra ([[Betty Field]]) posed a challenge for [[Warner Brothers]] because of [[incest]] and promiscuity in the novel ''Kings Row''.]] 
A [[Kings Row|film adaptation]] of [[Henry Bellamann]]'s controversial 1940 novel, ''Kings Row'', presented problems for producers at [[Warner Brothers]] because of the Production Code. The novel contained significant sexual content, including references to [[incest]], as well as [[euthanasia]] and the sadism of one of its principal characters, the town physician. It was initially believed that the Code made a movie adaptation of the novel impossible.<ref name='TCMarticle'> {{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=17922 |title=Kings Row |accessdate=2009-03-24 |last=Wood |first=Brett |work=TCM website |publisher=Turner Classic Movies }}</ref>  [[Joseph I. Breen]], director of the Production Code Authority, which administered the Production Code, wrote to the producers that "To attempt to translate such a story to the screen, even though it would be re-written to conform to the provisions of the Production Code is, in our judgment, a very questionable undertaking from the standpoint of the good and welfare of this industry".<ref name='TCMarticle'/> Breen objected to "illicit sexual relationships" between characters in the movie "without sufficient compensating moral values", and also objected to "the general suggestion of loose sex...which carries throughout the entire script".<ref name='Friedrich'>{{cite book | last = Friedrich | first = Otto | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = City of nets: a portrait of Hollywood in the 1940's | publisher = University of California Press (reprint) | date = 1997 | location = | pages = 86<U+2013>89 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=1Y9uZw7YNK8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=city+of+nets&lr=&ei=8P7ISYGWDIPGzQShwfTxCQ#PPA88,M1| doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0520209497 }}</ref> Breen said that any screenplay, no matter how well done, would likely bring condemnation of the film industry "from decent people everywhere" because of "the fact that it stems from so thoroughly questionable a novel. He said that the script was being referred to his superior, [[Will Hays]], "for a decision as to the acceptability of ''any'' production based upon the novel, ''Kings Row''".<ref name='Inside'> {{Cite book | last=Behlmer | first=Rudy | authorlink=Rudy Behlmer | coauthors= | title=Inside Warner Bros.

Screenwriter [[Casey Robinson]], producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] and associate producer [[David Lewis (producer)|David Lewis]]<ref name='Inside'/> met with Breen to resolve these issues, with Wallis saying that the film would "illustrate how a doctor could relieve the internal destruction of a stricken community". Breen said that his office would approve the film if all references to incest, [[nymphomania]], [[euthanasia]] and homosexuality, which had been suggested in the novel, be removed. All references to nude bathing were to be eliminated and "the suggestion of a sex affair between Randy and Drake will be eliminated entirely". It was agreed that Dr. Tower would know about the affair between Cassandra and Parris, and "that this had something to do with his killing of the girl".<ref name='Inside'/> After several drafts were rejected, Robinson was able to satisfy Breen. The film was released in February 1942.<ref name='TCMarticle'/>

====Political Censorship====
When [[Warner Bros]] wanted to make a film about [[concentration camp]]s in Nazi Germany, the production office forbade it, with threats to take the matter to the federal government if they proceeded with making it.  This policy prevented a number of anti-Nazi films being produced.  In 1938, the [[FBI]] unearthed and prosecuted a Nazi spy ring, subsequently allowing Warner Bros to produce  ''[[Confessions of a Nazi Spy]]''.<ref>The Brothers Warner (2008) documentary.</ref>

===The 1950s and early 1960s===
Hollywood worked within the confines of the Production Code until the late 1950s, by which time the "[[Golden Age of Hollywood]]" had ended, and the movies were faced with very serious competitive threats. The first threat came from a new technology, television, which did not require Americans to leave their house to watch moving pictures. Hollywood needed to offer the public something it could not get on television, which itself was under an even more restrictive censorship code.

In addition to the threat of television, there was also increasing competition from foreign films, like [[Vittorio de Sica]]'s ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' ([[1948 in film|1948]]), the Swedish film ''Hon dansade en sommar'' (English title: ''[[One Summer of Happiness]]'') (1951), and [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''Sommar med Monika'' (''[[Summer with Monika]]'') (1953). For De Sica's film, there was a censorship controversy when the MPAA demanded a scene where the lead characters talk to the prostitutes of a [[brothel]] be removed, regardless of the fact that there is no sexual or provocative activity. The Swedish films were the first to include nude love scenes, and made an international sensation.

[[Vertical integration]] in the movie industry had been found to violate [[anti-trust]] laws, and studios had been forced to give up ownership of theatres by the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' (1948). The studios had no way to keep foreign films out, and foreign films were not bound by the Production Code. The anti-trust rulings also helped pave the way for independent [[art film|art houses]] that would show films created by people such as [[Andy Warhol]] and others working outside the studio system.

Finally, a boycott from the Legion of Decency no longer guaranteed a commercial failure, and thus the Code prohibitions began to vanish when Hollywood producers ignored the Code and were still able to earn profits.

The MPAA revised the code in [[1951 in film|1951]], not to make it more flexible but to make it more rigid. The 1951 revisions spelled out more words and subjects that were prohibited, and no doubt increased the opposition of movie-makers to the code.

In 1952, in the case of ''[[Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously overruled its 1915 decision and held that motion pictures were entitled to First Amendment protection, so that the [[New York State Board of Regents]] could not ban ''The Miracle'', a [[short film]] that was one half of ''[[L'Amore (film)|L'Amore]]'' (1948), an [[anthology film]] directed by [[Roberto Rossellini]]. Film distributor [[Joseph Burstyn]] released the film in the U.S. in 1950, and the case became known as the "Miracle Decision" due to its connection to Rossellini's film. That in turn reduced the threat of government regulation that justified the Production Code, and the PCA's powers over the Hollywood industry were greatly reduced.<ref name="H:325">Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998),  ''Hollywood Be Thy Name,'' Prima Publishing, ISN:559858346 p. 325.</ref> 

At the forefront of contesting the code was director [[Otto Preminger]], whose films violated the code repeatedly in the 1950s. His [[1953 in film|1953]] film ''[[The Moon is Blue]]'', about a young woman who tries to play two suitors off against each other by claiming that she plans to keep her virginity until marriage, was the first film to use the words "virgin", "seduce" and "mistress", and it was released without a certificate of approval. He later made ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' ([[1955 in film|1955]]) which portrayed the prohibited subject of drug abuse, and ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'' ([[1959 in film|1959]]) which dealt with [[rape]]. Preminger's films were direct assaults on the authority of the Production Code and, since they were successful, hastened its abandonment.

In [[1954 in film|1954]] Joseph Breen retired and [[Geoffrey Shurlock]] was appointed as his successor. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted "a decided tendency towards a broader, more casual approach" in the enforcement of the code.

By the late 1950s increasingly explicit films began to appear, such as ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'' (1959), ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly Last Summer]]'' (1959), ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), and ''[[The Dark at the Top of the Stairs]]'' (1961). The MPAA reluctantly granted the seal of approval for these films, but not until certain cuts were made. [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959) was released without a certificate of approval due to its themes and became box office hits, and as a result further weakened the authority of the code.

In the early 1960s films began to deal with adult subjects and sexual matters that had not been seen in Hollywood films since the early 1930s. The MPAA reluctantly granted the seal of approval for these films, again not until certain cuts were made. The Code was finally abandoned in 1967. In that year, [[Warner Brothers]] wanted to release the new film ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]''. When [[Jack Valenti]] became President of the MPAA in 1966, he was faced with censoring the film's explicit language. Valenti negotiated a compromise: the word "screw" was removed but other language remained, including the phrase "hump the hostess". The film received Production Code approval despite this prohibited language.

===''[[The Pawnbroker (film)|The Pawnbroker]]'' and the end of the Code===
In the early 1960s, British films such as ''[[Victim (film)|Victim]]'' (1961), ''[[A Taste of Honey (film)|A Taste of Honey]]'' (1961) and ''[[The Leather Boys]]'' (1963) offered a daring social commentary about gender roles and [[homosexuality]], that violated the Hollywood Production Code, yet the films were still released in America. The American [[gay rights]], [[civil rights]], and youth movements prompted a reevaluation of the depiction of themes of race, class, gender, and sexuality that had been restricted by the Code.

In 1964, the [[Holocaust]] film ''[[The Pawnbroker (film)|The Pawnbroker]]'', directed by [[Sidney Lumet]] and starring [[Rod Steiger]], was initially rejected because of two scenes in which the actresses [[Linda Geiser]] and [[Thelma Oliver]] fully expose their breasts, and because of a sex scene between Oliver and [[Jaime S<U+00E1>nchez (actor)|Jaime S<U+00E1>nchez]] which it described as "unacceptably sex suggestive and lustful".  Despite the rejection, the film's producers arranged for Allied Artists to release the film without the Production Code seal, with the New York censors licensing ''The Pawnbroker'' without the cuts demanded by Code administrators. The producers also appealed the rejection to the Motion Picture Association of America. <ref name='Leff'> {{cite journal|title=Hollywood and the Holocaust: Remembering The Pawnbroker|journal=American Jewish History|date=1996|first=Leonard J.|last=Leff|coauthors=|volume=84|issue=4|pages=353<U+2013>376|id= |url=http://www.cmcdannell.com/HollywoodHolocaustReading.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-03-09 }}</ref>

On a 6-3 vote, the MPAA granted the film an "exception" conditional on "reduction in the length of the scenes which the Production Code Administration found unapprovable". The exception to the code was granted as a "special and unique case", and was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' at the time as "an unprecedented move that will not, however, set a precedent".<ref name='Pictures'>{{cite book | last = Harris | first = Mark | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Pictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of the New Hollywood | publisher = Penguin Group | date = 2008 | location = | pages = 173<U+2013>176 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=_T9tCvzIFrcC&pg=PA174&dq=The+Pawnbroker+steiger&lr=&ei=n762ScWLL43IMq3ioPQL#PPA176,M1 | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1594201523 }}</ref>
The requested reductions of nudity were minimal; the outcome was viewed in the media as a victory for the film's producers.<ref name='Leff'/>

''The Pawnbroker'' was the first film featuring bare breasts to receive Production Code approval. In his 2008 study of films during that era, ''Pictures at a Revolution'', author Mark Harris wrote that the MPAA's action was "the first of a series of injuries to the Production Code that would prove fatal within three years". <ref name='Pictures'/> 

The British-produced, but American financed film ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966) presented a different problem. After the film was denied Production Code approval, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] released it anyway, the first instance of an MPAA member company distributing a film that didn't have an approval certificate. There was little the MPAA could do about it.

Enforcement had become impossible, and the Production Code was abandoned entirely. The MPAA began working on a rating system, under which film restrictions would lessen. The [[MPAA film rating system]] went into effect on November 1, [[1968 in film|1968]] with four ratings: ''G'', ''M'', ''R'', and ''X''. In 1969, the Swedish film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'' directed by [[Vilgot Sj<U+00F6>man]], was initially banned in the U.S. for its frank depiction of sexuality; however this was overturned by the Supreme Court.  

The ''M'' rating was changed to ''GP'' in [[1970 in film|1970]] and to the current ''PG'' in [[1972 in film|1972]]. In [[1984 in film|1984]], in response to public complaints regarding the severity of horror elements in PG-rated titles such as ''[[Gremlins]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', the ''PG-13'' rating was created as a middle tier between ''PG'' and ''R.'' In [[1990 in film|1990]], the ''X'' rating was replaced by ''NC-17'', in part because the ''X'' rating was not trademarked by the MPAA whereas [[pornographic]] bookstores and theatres were using their own trademark ''X'' and ''XXX'' symbols to market their products.
