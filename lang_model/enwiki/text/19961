|filetype=[[Ogg]]}}

"'''Kiss from a Rose'''" is a song from [[Seal (musician)|Seal]]'s second [[eponymous]] album [[Seal (1994 album)|''Seal'' (aka ''Seal II'')]]. The song was first released as a single in July 1994. Re-released in 1995, it was included on the [[Batman Forever (soundtrack)|''Batman Forever'' film soundtrack]], helping it top the charts in the U.S. and Australia. It took the 1996 [[Grammy Awards]] for both Record of the Year and Song of the Year. Seal also won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.

==Description==
Written by Seal, the single "Kiss from a Rose", the second taken from the ''[[Batman Forever]]'' film soundtrack, topped the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for one week in August 1995. It also went to number four on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The single originally made it to #20 in 1994, but upon being re-released after being featured in the film, it reached the top position. It was also nominated for a [[MTV Movie Awards 1996|1996 MTV Movie Award]].<ref name="Songfacts">{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3821 |title=Kiss From A Rose by Seal Songfacts |publisher=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref> Seal talked about the long, strange journey that the song went through on The Brian McKnight Show season finale that aired Sunday, 12:30 A.M., May 30, 2010. He said the song first arrived on the charts at #60 and then got dropped off the charts. It wasn't until he got a call from [[Joel Schumacher]] that he wanted to use the song to play over a love scene between the characters played by [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Val Kilmer]]. It wound up being moved to play over the end credits and, as Seal said, many people that saw the movie recalled the song and loved it which he admitted wasn't commercial. He also pointed out that the song is a waltz done in 3/4 time.

==Music video==
Two versions of the [[music video]] were produced:

* The original version is set in a [[photographic studio]] and was directed by [[Matthew Rolston]].
* The second version was directed by [[Joel Schumacher]] and has Seal performing the song beside the [[Bat-Signal]], interspersed with clips from the film ''Batman Forever''. This is the more popular video of the song. The director of photography of this version of the music video was Neil Abramson, backing vocals by several singers including Kelly Parkins an up and coming singer from Plymouth. Oddly enough, the song was scrapped from appearing in the movie.

==Track listing==
Between all the formats of the single release, bonus tracks include the non-album tracks "[[The Wind Cries Mary]]" (a [[Jimi Hendrix]] cover) and "Blues in 'E'"; remixes of "Kiss from a Rose" by [[Adamski]] (who produced the original version of "[[Killer (Seal song)|Killer]]"); and remixes of album track "I'm Alive" by [[Steve Fitzmaurice]] and [[Sasha (DJ)|Sasha]] with [[Brian Transeau|BT]].
