[[Major general (United States)|Major General]] '''John H. Church''' (June 28, 1892 <U+2013> November 3, 1953) was a [[U.S. Army]] officer who fought in [[World War I]], [[World War II]] and in the [[Korean War]].

==Early life==
John Huston Church was born in the town of Glen Iron, [[Pennsylvania]], on June 28, 1892.  From 1915 until 1917, he was a student at [[New York University]].  When the United States entered the First World War, Church joined the army and was given the commissioned rank of [[second lieutenant]].

==Military career==
In France with the 28th Infantry Regiment, 1st Division, [[American Expeditionary Force]], Church fought valiantly and was wounded twice, earning a [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for heroism in action at Cantigny.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|title=John H. Church <U+2013> Awards and citations|url=http://www.militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=11213|accessdate=14 August 2011}}</ref> After the war, Church decided to stay in the army.  He instructed [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]] members in both Maryland and Arizona, and also served in the Philippines from 1933 to 1936.<ref name="US Army Officers 1939<U+2013>1945">{{Cite web |url=http://www.unithistories.com/officers/US_Army_officers_C01.html |title=US Army Officers 1939<U+2013>1945 |accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref>

===World War II===
When World War II broke out, Church became the assistant chief of staff for operations, and then chief of staff of the [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th Infantry Division]]. Church served with the division from 1943<U+2013>1944 in [[Sicily]], southern [[Italy]], [[Anzio]], and [[Operation Dragoon]], the invasion of southern France.<ref name=Blair73>Blair 1987, p. 73</ref>  In September, 1944, having been promoted to [[Brigadier General|brigadier general]] after being commanding the 157th Infantry Regiment for a time, he was sent to the 84th Infantry Division to be the assistant division commander.<ref name="US Army Officers 1939<U+2013>1945"/> Church was wounded again as his division, along with several others, led the way from the [[Netherlands]] to the [[Elbe River]] towards the end of the war.<ref name=Blair73>Blair 1987, p. 73</ref>

A year after the war ended, Brigadier General Church became the commander of the Infantry Replacement Training Center at Fort McClellan, [[Alabama]].  He was given the same post at Fort Jackson South Carolina, where he was soon given command of the [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th Infantry Division]].  From 1948 until 1949 Church served as the deputy chief of army field forces in [[Fort Monroe]], [[Virginia]].  In 1950, Church was serving in General Douglas MacArthur's headquarters in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Korean War===
When the communist [[North Korean]] Army invaded [[South Korea]], MacArthur sent Church to lead a survey team of staff officers to work with Ambassador Muccio and the [[Korean Military Advisory Group]] (KMAG) and assess what assistance could be provided to the ROK Army.  This task resulted in the establishment of GHQ Advance Command and Liaison Group (ADCOM) at [[Suwon]].<ref name=Weintraub45-51>Weintraub 2001, pp. 45<U+2013>51</ref>

The [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]], which was stationed in [[Japan]] as part of the [[U.S. Eighth Army]], was the first army unit sent over from Japan under the command of Major General [[William F. Dean]].  A reinforced company of the division, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Brad Smith, was sent north from Pusan to try to halt the North Koreans.  Meeting with Smith at [[Taejon]], Church informed him "All we need is some men up there who won't run when they see tanks",<ref name=Weintraub63>Weintraub 2001, p. 63</ref> and instructed Smith to make his stand at [[Osan]].<ref name=Halberstam145>Halberstam 2007, p. 145</ref>  Task Force Smith was without tank support and had faulty communications, and was promptly overrun in its first engagement with the North Koreans.  Dean gathered his troops in the city of [[Taejon]] and formed a strong defense.  After a stubborn fight, the American troops retreated.  Dean got separated from his troops and was captured.  On July 22, Church, without a command following the dissolution of ADCOM, was given command of the division.<ref name=Blair141-142>Blair 1987, pp. 141<U+2013>142</ref>

The division was given a two-day period to rest, but then General [[Walton Walker]], the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, decided that he needed the 24th to guard the Southwest line (the [[Naktong Bulge]]) of the [[Pusan Perimeter]].  The North Korean 6th Division inflicted more losses on Church's men and gradually pushed the 24th back.  Finally, Church by now promoted to major general, was able to regroup his men, and they fought bravely, especially with the help of a marine brigade.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Eventually, the 25th  turned the tables on the Communist divisions that were fighting them.

Frail and suffering from arthritis,<ref name=Blair73>Blair 1987, p. 73</ref> Church remained in command of the 24th until early 1951. Lieutenant General [[Matthew Ridgway]], commander of the U.S. Eighth Army following the death of Walker in December 1950, replaced Church with Brigadier General [[Blackshear M. Bryan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://24thida.com/24th_division/24th_material_tredway_general/24th_commanding_generals_gay.pdf |title=24th Infantry Division Commanding Generals  |last=Gay|first=Larry |date= |publisher=The Taro Leaf: Official Publication of the 24th Infantry Division Association |accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref> Church was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] for his services.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|title=John H.

Church subsequently was appointed commandant of the Infantry School at [[Fort Benning]], Georgia <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,805734,00.html |title=New Command Team in Korea  |author= |date=5 March 1951 |publisher=Time |accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref>  and served in that capacity until his retirement in June 1952.  Major General John H. Church died on 3 November 1953 in [[Washington, D.C.]].  He is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]], [[Virginia]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Russ|title=www.findagrave.com|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=mr&MRid=46633397|accessdate=14 August 2011}}</ref>
