The '''Pithole Stone Arch Bridge''' is a {{convert|37|ft|adj=on}} [[masonry]] [[arch bridge]] that spans [[Pithole Creek]] between [[Cornplanter Township, Venango County, Pennsylvania|Cornplanter]] and [[President Township, Venango County, Pennsylvania|President]] Townships, [[Venango County, Pennsylvania|Venango County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. The bridge was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988 and was document by the [[Historic American Buildings Survey|History American Engineering Record]] (HAER) in 1997. 

== History ==
On August 23, 1897, residents of Cornplanter and President Townships [[petition]]ed Venango County to construct a bridge over Pithole Creek.<ref name="haer 5">Rothstein, p. 5.</ref> It was decided that the county would assist the township in construction of bridge by constructed the stone [[abutment]]s and iron [[superstructure]] and signed a contract to that effect on June 15, 1898. However, Venango County awarded a contract for "stone bridge over Pithole Creek" to [[stonemasonry|stonemason]] [[Richard A. Bigley]] a month later.<ref name="haer 5"/> The bridge was deemed completed on January 3, 1899, however observers of the construction felt that the bridge was not built to specifications and would need to be eventually replaced. The observer, who cited concerns about inferior [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and that the arch was not large enough to accommodate [[flood|floodwaters]], demanded that Bigley be docked $50.<ref name="haer 6">Rothstein, p. 6.</ref> The accusations were eventually withdrawn and Bigley received payment for the bridge&mdash;minus the $50 that was withheld by the county.<ref name="haer 9">Rothstein, p. 9.</ref>

The bridge was owned by both townships until 1935, when the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] passed an act turning over ownership of bridges on state routes to the predecessor to the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]] (PennDOT).<ref name="haer 9"/> On the a [[wing wall]]s was replaced in 1949. The bridge was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on June 22, 1988 and was documented by the Historic American Engineering Record in the summer of 1997.<ref name="focus"/><ref>Rothstein, p. 2.</ref>

== Design ==
The Pithole Stone Arch Bridge is a segmental [[arch bridge]], spanning {{convert|37|ft}} over Pithole Creek. The bridge is unusually with its short span and a flat arch that rises only {{convert|6|ft|7|in}}. Also unusually are the bridges massive abutments and for it being well-built for only a [[rural area|rural]] [[backroad]].<ref>Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, &sect; 13.</ref> The bridge was constructed using [[ashlar]] that was "coursed", meaning each successive layer of stone had a different height, but the stone in each layer had the same height.<ref>Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, &sect; 16.</ref> A total of 628&nbsp;[[Perch (unit)#Area|square perches]]&nbsp;(15,543&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>; 1,444&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) of [[sandstone]] were used in the bridge.<ref name="haer 6"/>
