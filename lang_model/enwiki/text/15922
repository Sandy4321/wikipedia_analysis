The '''Pactum Warmundi''' was a treaty of alliance established in [[1123]] between the [[Crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[Republic of Venice]]. 

==Background==

In 1123, King [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] was taken prisoner by the [[Artuqid dynasty|Artuqid Turks]], and the Kingdom of Jerusalem was subsequently invaded by the [[Fatimids]] of [[Egypt]]. The [[Doge of Venice]], [[Domenico Michele]], set sail with a large fleet, which defeated the Egyptian fleet off the coast of Syria and captured many ships. The Venetians then landed at [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]; the Doge completed a pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]], where he celebrated [[Christmas]], and met with [[Patriarch Gormond of Jerusalem|Patriarch Gormond]] and the [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|Constable]] [[William I of Bures|William Buris]], governing Jerusalem in place of Baldwin II. It was agreed that the Venetian fleet would help the crusaders attack either [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] or [[Ascalon]], the only two cities on the coast still under Muslim control; the barons from the south of the Kingdom wanted to attack Ascalon, while those in the north preferred to direct the fleet against Tyre, which was larger and wealthier and a valuable port for enemy [[Damascus]] further inland. According to [[William of Tyre]], "The matter came near resulting in a dangerous quarrel." Tyre was chosen by lot.

==Treaty==
A treaty of alliance was established between Jerusalem and the Venetians prior to the beginning of the siege of Tyre in February 1124 (the city capitulated to the crusaders later that year). The treaty was negotiated by [[Warmund, Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch Gormond]], and thus it is known as the ''Pactum Warmundi'' ("Warmundus" being the [[Latin]] form of his name). Earlier treaties had been negotiated between Jerusalem and the Venetians and other [[Italian city-states]], and the Venetians themselves had been granted privileges in 1100 and 1110 in return for military assistance, but this treaty was far more extensive. The ''Pactum'' granted the Venetians their own church, street, square, baths, market, scales, mill, and oven in every city controlled by the King of Jerusalem, except in Jerusalem itself, where their autonomy was more limited. In the other cities, they were permitted to use their own Venetian scales to conduct business and trade when trading with other Venetians, but otherwise they were to use the scales and prices established by the King. In Acre, they were granted a quarter of the city, where every Venetian "may be as free as in Venice itself." In Tyre and Ascalon (though neither had yet been captured), they were granted one-third of the city and one-third of the surrounding countryside, possibly as many as twenty-one villages in the case of Tyre. These privileges were entirely free from taxation, but Venetian ships would be taxed if they were carrying pilgrims, and in this case the King would personally be entitled to one-third of the tax. For their help in the siege of Tyre, the Venetians were entitled to 300 "Saracen [[byzant|besants]]" per year from the revenue of that city. They were permitted to use their own laws in civil suits between Venetians or in cases in which a Venetian was the defendant, but if a Venetian was the plaintiff the matter would be decided in the courts of the Kingdom. If a Venetian was shipwrecked or died in the Kingdom, his property would be sent back to Venice rather than being confiscated by the King. Anyone living in the Venetian quarter in Acre or the Venetian districts in other cities would be subject to Venetian law. 

The ''Pactum'' was signed by Patriarch Gormond; Ebremar, [[Archbishop of Caesarea]]; Bernard, Bishop of Nazareth; Aschetinus, Bishop of Bethlehem; Roger, Bishop of Lydda; Guildin, abbot of St. Mary of Josaphat; Gerard, prior of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulchre]]; Aicard, prior of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Templum Domini]]; Arnold, Prior of [[Zion|Mt. Sion]]; William Buris; and the chancellor, Pagan. Aside from William and Pagan, no secular authorities witnessed the treaty, perhaps indicating that the Venetians considered Jerusalem a papal fief.

==Results of the treaty==

Baldwin II ratified the ''Pactum'' upon his release from captivity in 1125, although he refused to recognize the Venetian [[medieval commune|communes]] as fully autonomous entities within the Kingdom; he asserted his [[feudal system|feudal]] rights by asking for the service of three Venetian knights. The treaty seems to have been in force up to the fall of the Kingdom in 1291, and the Venetian communes in Acre and Tyre were particularly powerful and influential in the 13th century after the Kingdom lost Jerusalem and was reduced to a coastal state. They resisted [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]]'s attempts to claim the Kingdom, and virtually ignored the authority the [[Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|Lord of Tyre]], conducting affairs instead as if they controlled their own independent lordship <U+2014> which, essentially, they did, thanks to the terms of the ''Pactum''. 

Other Italian and [[Proven<U+00E7>al]] city-states demanded and were granted similar commercial treaties by the King of Jerusalem throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, notably the [[Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Pisa|Pisans]]. The communes established by these treaties were in a sense an early form of European [[colonialism]], and were an important step in the commercial development of the Italian city-states that culminated in the [[Italian Renaissance]] in the following centuries.

The text of the treaty is preserved in the chronicle of [[William of Tyre]], who must have taken it from a surviving copy in Tyre; [[Fulcher of Chartres]], a contemporary, barely mentions the treaty at all. The text was also published in ''Urkunden zur <U+00E4>ltern Handels und Staatsgeschichte der Republik Venedig'' by G.L.F. Tafel and G.M. Thomas in 1856.
