'''Malvani''' is a dialect of [[Konkani Language|Konkani]] with significant [[Marathi language|Marathi]] influences and loanwords.<ref name="sd">{{cite book|last= Deshpande|first=Sunita|title=Encyclopaedic dictionary of Marathi literature|publisher=Global Vision Publishing Ho|year=2007|volume= Volume 2|pages=406|isbn=9788182202214}}</ref> Some define it as a [[Creole language|Creole]] between [[Konkani Language|Konkani]] and [[Marathi language|Marathi]].
