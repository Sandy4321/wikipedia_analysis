'''Knut''' ({{IPA-de|<U+02C8>knu<U+02D0>t|-|Mgm pronunciation Knut.ogg}}) (born 5 December 2006) is a [[polar bear]] who was born in [[Captivity (animal)|captivity]] at the [[Zoologischer Garten Berlin]].  Rejected by his mother at birth, he was subsequently raised by zookeepers.  He was the first polar bear cub to survive past infancy at the Berlin Zoo in more than thirty years.  At one time the subject of international controversy, he became a popular tourist attraction and commercial success.<ref name="knutbbc1">{{cite news | first=Tristana | last=Moore | title=Baby bear becomes media star | date=23 March 2007 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6486993.stm |publisher=[[BBC]] |  accessdate = 21 April 2007}}</ref>  After the German tabloid newspaper ''[[Bild-Zeitung|Bild]]'' ran a quote from an [[animal rights]] [[Activism|activist]] that seemingly called for the death of the young cub, a worldwide public outrage was caused as fans rallied in support of his being hand-raised by humans.  Children protested outside the zoo, and many e-mails and letters expressing sympathy for the cub's life were sent from around the world.<ref name="reprieve"/>

Knut became the center of a [[mass media]] phenomenon dubbed "Knutmania" that spanned the globe and quickly spawned numerous toys, media specials, DVDs, and books.<ref name="cashcow"/>  Because of this, the cub was largely responsible for a significant increase in revenue, estimated at about five million euros, at the Berlin Zoo in 2007.<ref name="stamp"/>  Zoo attendance figures for the year increased by an estimated 30 percent, making it the most profitable year in its 163-year history.<ref name="cult">{{cite news | title =Berlin Zoo culls creator of the cult of Knut | publisher =''[[The Times]]'' | date =13 December 2007 | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3042791.ece | accessdate =8 July 2009 | location=London | first=Roger | last=Boyes}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Infancy===
[[Image:Knut006.jpg|thumb|Thomas D<U+00F6>rflein plays with Knut on 31 May 2007.]]
Knut was born at the Berlin Zoo to 20-year-old Tosca, a former circus performer from East Germany who was born in Canada, and her 13-year-old mate Lars, who was originally from the [[Tierpark Hellabrunn]] in [[Munich]].  After an uncomplicated [[gestation]], Knut and his unnamed brother were born on 5 December 2006. Tosca rejected her cubs for unknown reasons, abandoning them on a rock in the polar bear enclosure.<ref name="cuddles">{{cite news | title =The little polar bear that grew too big for any more cuddles | publisher =''[[The Times]]'' | date =10 July 2007 | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article2050857.ece | accessdate =11 August 2007 | location=London | first=Roger | last=Boyes}}</ref>  Zoo keepers rescued the cubs by scooping them out of the enclosure with an extended fishing net,<ref name="cuddles"/> but Knut's brother died of an infection four days later. Knut was the first polar bear to have been born and survive in the Berlin Zoo in over thirty years. Only the size of a [[guinea pig]], he spent the first 44 days of his life in an [[Neonatal intensive care unit|incubator]] before zoo keeper [[Thomas D<U+00F6>rflein]] began raising the cub.<ref>{{cite web |title =He's too cute to bear.. | publisher = ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' | date =26 January 2007 | url =http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2007/01/26/he-s-too-cute-to-bear-115875-18533016/ | accessdate =8 July 2009 }}</ref>

Knut's need for round-the-clock care required that D<U+00F6>rflein not only sleep on a mattress next to Knut's sleeping crate at night, but also play with, bathe, and feed the cub daily. Knut's diet began with a bottle of baby formula mixed with cod liver oil every two hours, before graduating at the age of four months to a milk porridge mixed with cat food and vitamins.<ref name="dorflein"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://cbs5.com/watercooler/Knut.polar.bear.2.282333.html| title=Knut The Polar Bear Delights Fans On First Day Out|date=23 March 2007 |publisher=[[CBS News]]| accessdate=21 March 2008}}</ref> D<U+00F6>rflein also accompanied Knut on his twice-daily one-hour shows for the public and therefore appeared in many videos and photographs alongside the cub. As a result, D<U+00F6>rflein became a minor celebrity in Germany<ref name="dorflein">{{cite web | title =Knut's Keeper Confesses: 'Sometimes I Could Hurl Him Against the Wall' | publisher =''[[Spiegel Online]]'' | date =11 April 2007 | url =http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,476566,00.html | accessdate =10 August 2007 }}</ref> and was awarded Berlin's Medal of Merit in honour of his continuous care for the cub.<ref name="medal">{{cite web | title =Knut's keeper gets medal: Arise, Sir D<U+00F6>rflein | publisher =''[[Spiegel Online]]'' | date =1 December 2007 | url =http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,508944,00.html | accessdate =11 November 2007 }}</ref>  D<U+00F6>rflein died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on 22 September 2008.

===Controversy===
In early March 2007, German [[tabloid]] ''[[Bild-Zeitung]]'' carried a quote by [[animal rights]] [[activist]] Frank Albrecht who said that Knut should have been killed rather than humiliated by being raised "as a domestic pet". He declared that the zoo was violating animal protection legislation by keeping him alive.<ref>{{cite web | title =Berlin Zoo's baby polar bear must die: activists | publisher =[[ninemsn]] | date =21 March 2007 | url =http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=255770 | accessdate =10 August 2007 }}</ref>  Wolfram Graf-Rudolf, the director of the [[Aachen]] Zoo, agreed with Albrecht and stated that the zookeepers "should have had the courage to let the bear die" after it was rejected, arguing that the bear will "die a little" every time it is separated from its caretaker.<ref name="berlinrallies"/>  A group of children protested at the zoo, holding up placards reading "Knut Must Live" and "We Love Knut", and others sent numerous emails and letters asking for the cub's life to be spared.  Threatening letters were also sent to Albrecht.<ref name="reprieve">{{cite web | title =Reprieve for Berlin's Polar Bear Cub: Knut Will Live, Promises Berlin Zoo | publisher =''[[Spiegel Online]]'' | date =21 March 2007 | url =http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,472937,00.html | accessdate =10 August 2007 }}</ref>  The Berlin Zoo rallied in support of the baby polar bear, vowing not to harm him and rejecting the suggestion that it would be kinder to euthanise him.<ref name="berlinrallies">{{cite news | title =Berlin rallies behind baby bear | publisher =[[BBC]] | date =20 March 2007 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6470509.stm | accessdate =10 August 2007 }}</ref>

Albrecht, who was not associated with any particular animal rights organization, later claimed that he was quoted out of context: According to Albrecht, he had filed suit against the head of the [[Leipzig Zoological Garden|Leipzig Zoo]] in December 2006, for killing a [[Sloth Bear|sloth bear]] cub rejected by its mother. The case was dismissed by the courts arguing that raising the animal by humans would have been inappropriate. Albrecht, who opposed that judgment, says he called for Knut's death not because he actually wanted to have the bear killed, but merely to call attention to the Leipzig decision, which would have granted the Berlin Zoo the right to kill the polar bear cub.<ref>{{cite web | title =Look Out Knut...It's A Zoo Out There | publisher =[[ABC Online]] | url =http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1887892.htm | accessdate =10 August 2007 }}</ref> The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.<ref>{{cite web | coauthors =Scott Simon and Emily Harris | title =For Germans, Knut Is Almost Too Cute to Bear  | publisher =[[National Public Radio]] | date =24 March 2007 | url =http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9121042 | accessdate =10 August 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title =Activist to zoo: Wrong to save baby polar bear | publisher =[[MSNBC]] | date =20 March 2007 | url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17703212/?GT1=9145 | accessdate =10 August 2007 }}</ref>

===In the spotlight===
On 23 March 2007, Knut was presented to the public for the first time.<ref name="knutday">{{cite web | last =Chambers | first =Madeline | title ="Knut Day" in Berlin as polar bear cub goes public | publisher =[[Reuters]] | date =23 March 2007 | url =http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSL2362537420070323 | accessdate =10 August 2007 }}</ref>  Around 400 [[journalist]]s visited the Berlin Zoo on what was dubbed "Knut Day" to report on the cub's first public appearance to a worldwide audience.<ref name="mediaknut">{{cite news | first=Kate | last=Connolly  | title=Rejected at birth, Knut becomes Berlin zoo's bear essential | date=23 March 2007 | url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/animalrights/story/0,,2041865,00.html | work =[[The Guardian]] | accessdate =21 April 2007 | location=London}}</ref>  Because Knut became the focus of worldwide media at a very young age, many stories and false alarms regarding the cub's health and well-being were circulated during his first year.  For example, on 16 April 2007, Knut was removed from display due to [[teething]] pains resulting from the growth of his right upper [[canine tooth]], but initial reports vaguely stated that he was suffering from an unknown illness and subsequently put on antibiotics.<ref>{{cite web | title =Knut the polar bear suffers teething pain | publisher =[[MSNBC]] | date =16 April 2007 | url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18135246/?GT1=9246 | accessdate =10 August 2007 }}</ref>  Much ado was also made about a death threat that was sent shortly before 15:00 local time on Wednesday 18 April 2007.  The zoo had received an anonymous letter by fax which said "Knut ist tot! Donnerstag Mittag." ("Knut is dead! Thursday noon.")<ref>{{cite web | title =Wer will Knut t<U+00F6>ten? | language =German | publisher =''[[Bild-Zeitung|Bild]]'' | date =19 April 2007 | url =http://www.bild.t-online.de/BTO/news/2007/04/19/knut-eisbaer/mord-drohung.html | accessdate =10 August 2007 }}</ref> In response, the police increased their security measures around the bear.

[[Image:KnutVideo2.ogg|thumb|200px|Five months after his debut, the 90&nbsp;kg cub is shown on 31 October 2007.]]
Despite ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reporting on 30 April 2007 that Knut was "steadily getting less cute" as he increased in age,<ref name="lesscute">{{cite web | title =End of an Era Nearing: Knut Steadily Getting Less Cute |publisher=''[[Der Spiegel]]'' |date=30 April 2007 | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,480321,00.html | accessdate =10 August 2007 }}</ref> Knut continued to bring in record crowds to the zoo that summer.  After reaching seven months old and 50&nbsp;kg (110&nbsp;lb) in July 2007, Knut's scheduled twice daily public appearances were canceled due to the zoo's concern for the safety of his keeper.  Zoo spokeswoman Regine Damm also said it was time for the bear to "associate with other bears and not with other people."<ref>{{cite web | title =He's Just Knut So Cuddly Anymore! |publisher=[[Sky News]] |date=9 July 2007 |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1274302,00.html |accessdate=10 August 2007 }}</ref>  After living in the same enclosure as Ernst, a Malaysian black bear cub who was born a month before Knut, and its mother,<ref name="ernst">{{cite web |title =Knut the Polar Bear Cub Overshadows the Cub Next Door | publisher =[[WDEF TV|WDEF News]] |date=18 April 2007 |url=http://wdef.com/node/4135 | accessdate =18 November 2007 }}</ref> Knut was then moved to his own private living space.  While visitor numbers dwindled from extreme highs in March and April, Knut remained a major attraction at the zoo for the rest of 2007.  400,000 guests were recorded in August 2007, which was an all time high.<ref>{{cite web | title =Knut Feigning Sore Paw to Get Attention | publisher =''[[Spiegel Online]]'' |date=11 September 2007 | url =http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,505148,00.html | accessdate =13 September 2007 }}</ref>

News of Knut and his life at the zoo was still being reported internationally in late 2007.  Knut's restricted diet, necessary to curtail his natural weight gain necessary to survive harsh winters, made headlines outside of Germany.<ref>{{cite web | title =Celebrity Polar Bear Knut on a Diet |publisher=''Red Orbit'' |date=31 July 2007 |url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1018442/celebrity_polar_bear_knut_on_a_diet/index.html | accessdate =8 July 2009 }}</ref>  His daily meals were reduced in number from four to three, and treats, such as [[croissant]]s, which are favored by the young polar bear, were restricted.<ref>{{cite web | title =Berlin Zoo Puts Media Darling Knut on a Diet | publisher =[[Deutsche Welle]] | date =1 August 2007 | url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2717231,00.html | accessdate =10 August 2007 }}</ref>  After hurting his foot while slipping on a wet rock in his enclosure a month later in September, there was an outpouring of concern and support from fans worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |title =Knut is back in the public eye | publisher =''Independent Online'', South Africa | date =10 September 2007 | url =http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=143&art_id=nw20070909194911780C508965 | accessdate =10 September 2007 }}</ref>

In November 2007 and weighing over 90&nbsp;kg (198&nbsp;lb), Knut was deemed too dangerous for close handling and his interaction with human handlers was further diminished.   The celebration of the cub's first birthday, which was attended by hundreds of children, was broadcast live on German television.  The national mint also issued 25,000 special commemorative silver coins to mark his birthday.<ref name="birthday">{{cite web | title =Knut the bear celebrates first birthday with fish cake | publisher =AFP | date =5 December 2007 | url =http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iZJq1M-gh2A5DY_1OuRCUDffs1ow | accessdate =5 December 2007 }}</ref>  Knut's future role at the Berlin Zoo may include his becoming an "attractive stud" for other zoos in order to help preserve his species.<ref>{{cite web |title =Activist to zoo: Wrong to save baby polar bear | publisher =[[MSNBC]] | date =20 March 2007 | url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17703212/ | accessdate =13 September 2007 }}</ref>  When [[Flocke]] was born at the [[Tiergarten N<U+00FC>rnberg|Nuremberg Zoo]] in December 2007 under similar circumstances, ''Bild'' dubbed her  Mrs. Knut, suggesting that the two German-born polar bears might become mates when they mature.<ref name="dubbed">{{cite web | title =German Polar Bear Cub Dubbed "Flocke" | publisher =[[CBS News]] | date =18 January 2008 | url =http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/01/18/world/main3728990.shtml?source=RSSattr=World_3728990 | accessdate =30 April 2008 }}</ref>

===2008&ndash;2010===
[[File:Knut20081230-3.jpg|thumb|Knut at the age of two years (December 2008)]]
A year after his public debut, Knut was reported as weighing more than 130&nbsp;kg (286&nbsp;lb).  A plate of six-inch glass, strong enough to resist a mortar blast, was erected between him and zoo visitors.<ref>{{cite web |title =Still think I'm cute?

"Knut needs an audience," R<U+00F6>bke stated.  "That has to change".<ref name="pining"/>  In April, animal welfare campaigners criticized the zoo for allowing Knut to kill and eat ten [[carp]] from the moat surrounding his enclosure, saying that it was a breach of German animal protection regulations.  The zoo's bear expert, Heiner Kl<U+00F6>s, however, said that Knut's behavior was "all part of being a polar bear."<ref>{{cite web |title =Knut Caught Munching 10 Live Fish | publisher =''[[Spiegel Online]]'' | date =7 April 2008 | url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=524382&amp;in_page_id=1770/ | accessdate =8 April 2008 }}</ref>

In July 2008, it was announced that the [[Neum<U+00FC>nster]] Zoo in northern Germany, which owns Knut's father, was suing the Berlin Zoo for the profits from Knut's success.<ref>{{cite web |title =Zoos Fight For Knut Loot | publisher =[[Forbes]] | date =10 July 2008 | url =http://www.forbes.com/facesinthenews/2008/07/10/knut-zoo-battle-face-markets-cx_je_0710autofacescan01.html | accessdate =28 July 2008 }}</ref>  Although the Berlin Zoo conceded Neum<U+00FC>nster's ownership of Knut due to a previous agreement, it has contended that the other zoo has no right to its proceeds.  Neum<U+00FC>nster had previously tried to negotiate with Berlin Zoo, but is now seeking a court ruling in their favor.  Peter Dr<U+00FC>wa, the zoo director at Neum<U+00FC>nster, stated that they "do not want to remove Knut from his environment, but we have a right to our request for money."<ref>{{cite news |title =Zoos in battle over Knut the polar bear's riches | publisher =''[[The Guardian]]'' | date =10 July 2008 | url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jul/10/wildlife.endangeredspecies?gusrc=rss&feed=networkfront | accessdate =28 July 2008 | location=London | first=Lee | last=Glendinning}}</ref>  Shortly before Knut's second birthday, reports began circulating that the bear would have to be relocated to another zoo because he was becoming too large for his enclosure.  The zoo has since released statements that they wish to keep Knut, and the mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit, has also declared he wants the still-adolescent cub to stay in the capital.<ref>{{cite news |title =Berlin Zoo determined to keep star attraction Knut  | publisher =''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' | date =11 December 2008 | url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/3702615/Berlin-Zoo-determined-to-keep-star-attraction-Knut.html | accessdate =5 January 2009 | location=London | first=David | last=Wroe}}</ref>

Disputes between the two zoos continued into 2009.  On 19 May, the Berlin Zoo offered to buy Knut from Neum<U+00FC>nster and therefore negate their financial claim on the two-year-old polar bear.  Although Neum<U+00FC>nster Zoo set a price of <U+20AC>700,000, the Berlin Zoo stated that they would not pay "a cent more" than <U+20AC>350,000 ($488,145).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/europe/news/article_1478260.php/Courtroom_wranglings_over_price_of_famous_Berlin_polar_bear_Knut_|title=Courtroom wranglings over price of famous Berlin polar bear Knut|publisher=''[[Monsters and Critics]]''|date=19 May 2009|accessdate=19 May 2009}}</ref>  On 8 July, the Berlin Zoo agreed to pay <U+20AC>430,000 ($599,721) to keep Knut in Berlin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8140185.stm|title=Star Bear Knut to stay at Berlin|publisher=''[[BBC News]]''| date=8 July 2009 | accessdate=8 July 2009 }}</ref>

Giovanna, a female polar bear roughly the same age as Knut, was relocated to Berlin from [[Munich]]'s Hellabrunn Animal Garden in September 2009.  She was presented to the public on 23 September, and is due to briefly share Knut's enclosure while her regular home in Munich undergoes repairs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hkKiMd7bfEFFL7HB0ovl4TqYT7yAD9AT49IG0|title=Polar bear Knut's friend Giovanna meets the press|publisher=''Associated Press''| date=23 September 2009 | accessdate=28 September 2009 }}</ref>  Her arrival sparked international interest, as many sources mused that the two bears (although sexually immature) will soon be "dating".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/09/24/earlyshow/main5334596.shtml|title=Famed Polar Bear Knut Enters Dating World|publisher=''CBS''| date=24 September 2009 | accessdate=28 September 2009 }}</ref>  However, in March 2010, the German chapter of [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] called for Knut to be castrated in order to avoid inbreeding; he and Giovanna share a grandfather and, according to PETA spokesperson Frank Albrecht, the same animal rights activist who spoke out about Knut's handraising three years earlier, their offspring would threaten the genetic diversity of the German polar bear population.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/call-to-castrate-knut-the-polar-bear/story-e6frfku0-1225836324898|title=Call to castrate Knut the polar bear|publisher=news.com.au| date=3 March 2009 | accessdate=6 March 2010 }}</ref>  The Berlin Zoo declined to comment on the matter, only noting that Giovanna's stay in Berlin was still temporary.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/knut-castrated-animal-rights-group/story?id=9995164&page=2|title=Knut Should be Castrated, Animal Rights Group Says|publisher=ABC News| date=3 March 2009 | accessdate=6 March 2010 }}</ref>  In August 2010, Giovanna was moved back to Munich after repairs on her enclosure were completed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/7923461/Knut-the-polar-bear-separated-from-girlfriend.html|title=Knut the polar bear separated from girlfriend|publisher=''The Telegraph''|date=3 August 2010|accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref>

On 1 May 2007 it was announced that New York-based Turtle Pond Publications and the Berlin Zoo had signed a deal for the worldwide publishing rights to Knut with the hopes of raising awareness of [[global warming]] issues.  Written by [[Craig Hatkoff]] and his daughters Juliana and Isabella, the 44-page book entitled ''Knut, der kleine Eisb<U+00E4>renjunge'' (''Little Polar Bear Knut'') includes Knut's life story as well as previously unpublished photographs.<ref name="childrensbook">{{cite web | last =Allen | first =Kristen| title =Berlin Zoo Introduces Children's Book | publisher =Bay Ledger News | date =26 July 2007 | url =http://www.blnz.com/news/2007/07/26/Berlin_introduces_childrens_book_book.html | accessdate =8 July 2009 }}</ref>  Although several books about Knut had already been published in Germany, this book was the first to be authorized by the Berlin Zoo.<ref name="childrensbook"/>

===Environmental causes===

Dr. Gerald Uhlich, of the Berlin zoo's board of trustees, stated that because of his vast popularity, Knut has become a means of communication and that he has the ability to "draw attention to the environment in a nice way. Not in a threatening, scolding way."<ref name="millionairebear"/>  As a result, the German Environment Minister [[Sigmar Gabriel]] officially adopted Knut as the mascot for a conference on endangered species to be held in [[Bonn]] in 2008.<ref name="millionairebear">{{cite news | last =Burke | first =Jason | title =Knut's a millionaire bear, while he's cuddly | publisher =''[[The Observer]]'' | date =13 May 2007 | url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/may/13/conservation.theobserver | accessdate =10 August 2007 | location=London}}</ref>  The minister met with Knut soon after his zoo debut, commenting that although Knut was in safe hands, "worldwide polar bears are in danger and if Knut can help the cause, then that is a good thing."<ref name="knutday"/>

Photographer [[Annie Leibovitz]] took pictures of Knut that were used for an environmental campaign, including ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine's May 2007 Green Issue in which he was superimposed into a photograph with American actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/toc/2007/toc200705 |title=''Vanity Fair'' May 2007 Table of Contents |publisher=''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''|date=1 May 2007| accessdate=10 August 2007 }}</ref>  The polar bear has also been depicted on the logo for the German Environment Minister's campaign to help stop global warming<ref name="birthday"/> and a 2008 special issue stamp.  Officially released on 9 April, the stamp shows the roughly one-year-old Knut with the slogan "Natur weltweit bewahren" ("Preserve nature worldwide").<ref name="stamp">{{cite web | publisher =[[Reuters]] |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSL0989327920080409?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0 |title=Move over Knut:Germany's new polar bear cub debuts | date=9 April 2008 | accessdate=9 April 2008 }}</ref>
