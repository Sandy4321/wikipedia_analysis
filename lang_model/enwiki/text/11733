{{Campaignbox Cologne War}}
{{FixBunching|end}}

The '''Cologne War''', 1583<U+2013>1588, devasted the [[Electorate of Cologne]], an ecclesiastical principality of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (in present-day [[North-Rhine-Westphalia]], in [[Germany]]). The war occurred within the context of the [[Protestant]] [[Protestant Reformation#16th century|Reformation in Germany]] and the consequent [[Roman Catholic]] [[Counter-Reformation]].

Also called the '''Seneschal's War''' or the '''Seneschal Upheaval''', the war tested the principle of [[reservatum ecclesiasticum|ecclesiastical reservation]], which had been included in the religious [[Peace of Augsburg]] (1555). This principle excluded, or "reserved", the ecclesiastical territories of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from the application of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'', or, "who rules, his religion", as the primary means to determine the religion of a territory. It had been stipulated instead that if an ecclesiastical prince converted to Protestantism, he would resign from his position, not force the conversion of his subjects.

In December 1582, [[Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg|Gebhard, Truchsess von Waldburg]], the [[Prince-elector]] of Cologne, converted to [[Protestantism]]. The principle of ecclesiastical reservation required his resignation.  Instead, he declared religious parity for his subjects and, in 1583, married [[Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben]], intending to convert the ecclesiastical principality into a secular, dynastic duchy. A faction in the Cathedral Chapter elected another archbishop, [[Ernst of Bavaria]]. 

Initially, troops of the competing [[archbishop of Cologne|archbishops of Cologne]] fought over control of sections of the territory.  Several of the barons and counts holding territory with [[feudal]] obligations to the Elector also held territory in nearby Dutch provinces, Westphalia, Liege, and the Southern, or [[Southern Netherlands|Spanish Netherlands]]. Complexities of [[enfeoffment]] and dynastic ''[[appanage]]'' expanded a localized feud to include supporters from the [[Electoral Palatinate]] and Dutch, Scots and English mercenaries on the Protestant side, and [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavarian]] and papal mercenaries on the Catholic side. In 1586, it expanded further, with direct involvement of Spanish troops and Italian mercenaries for the Catholic side, and financial and diplomatic support from [[Henry III of France]] and [[Elizabeth I of England]] on the Protestant side. 

The conflict coincided with the [[Dutch Revolt]], 1568<U+2013>1648, encouraging participation of the rebellious Dutch provinces and the Spanish. The Cologne War resulted in the consolidation of [[Wittelsbach]] authority in northwestern German territories and in a [[Catholic Reformation|Catholic revival]] on the lower Rhine. Importantly, it also set a precedent for outside intervention in German religious and dynastic conflicts.

==Background==

===Religious divisions in the Holy Roman Empire===
{{Main|Protestant Reformation}}

Prior to the 16th century, the [[Catholic Church]] had been the sole official Christian faith in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. [[Martin Luther|Martin Luther's]] agenda called for the reform of the Church, but was not necessarily a rejection of the faith ''per se.'' Initially dismissed by [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] as an inconsequential argument between monks, the idea of reformation of the Church accentuated controversy and competition in many of the territories of the Holy Roman Empire and quickly devolved into armed factions that accentuated existing social, political and territorial grievances. These tensions were embodied in such alliances as the [[Schmalkaldic League]], through which many of the princes agreed to protect each other from encroachment on their territories and local authority. By the mid-1530s, the German-speaking states of the Holy Roman Empire had devolved into armed factions determined by family ties, geographic needs, and dynastic aspirations. The religious issue both accentuated and masked these secular conflicts.<ref>[[Hajo Holborn]], ''A History of Modern Germany, The Reformation'', Princeton NJ, Princeton University Press, 1959, generally, see pp. 204<U+2013>246, for a discussion of Protestant fear of suppression, political divisions, and consolidation of Protestant activities, see pp. 204<U+2013>210; for Habsburg policy, Schmalkalden activities, and the alliance between Charles and Clement, pp. 214<U+2013>227.</ref>

Princes and clergy alike understood that institutional abuses hindered the practices of the faithful, but they disagreed on the solution to the problem.<ref>Holborn, p. 205.</ref> [[Pope Paul III]] convened a council to examine the problem in 1537&nbsp;and instituted several internal, institutional reforms intended to obviate some of the most flagrant [[prebendary]] abuses, [[simony]], and [[nepotism]]; despite efforts by both the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and the pontiff, unification of the two strands of belief foundered on different concepts of "Church" and the principle of [[Justification (theology)|justification]].<ref>Holborn explains that the papacy was unusually weak, due to the deaths of Julius in 1555&nbsp;and his successor six weeks later (p. 242); See also Hubert Jedin, ''Konciliengeschichte'', Freiburg, Herder, 1980, ISBN 9780816404490, p. 85.</ref> The Schmalkaldic League called its own [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] council in 1537, and set forward several precepts of faith. When the delegates met in [[Regensburg]] in 1540<U+2013>41, representatives agreed on the doctrine of faith and justification, but could not agree on sacraments, confession, absolution, and the definition of the church.<ref>Holborn, pp. 227<U+2013>248.</ref> Catholic and Lutheran adherents seemed further apart than ever; in only a few towns and cities were Lutherans and Catholics able to live together in even a semblance of harmony. By 1548, political disagreements overlapped with religious issues, making any kind of agreement seem remote.<ref>Holborn, pp. 229<U+2013>245, particularly pp. 231<U+2013>232.</ref>  

In 1548 Charles declared an ''interreligio imperialis'' (also known as the [[Augsburg Interim]]) through which he sought to find some common ground for religious peace. This effort alienated both Protestant and Catholic princes and the papacy; even Charles, whose decree it was, was unhappy with the political and diplomatic dimensions of what amounted to half of a religious settlement.<ref>Holborn, pp. 231<U+2013>232.</ref> The 1551<U+2013>52 sessions convened by [[Pope Julius III]] at the supposedly ecumenical [[Council of Trent]] solved none of the larger religious issues but simply restated Catholic teaching and condemned Protestant teaching as heresies.<ref>Holborn, p. 241.</ref>

}}

===Overcoming religious division===
{{details|Peace of Augsburg}} 
Clearly, Charles' interim solution could not continue. He ordered a general [[Diet of Augsburg|Diet in Augsburg]] at which the various states would discuss the religious problem and its solution. He himself did not attend, and delegated authority to his brother, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], to "act and settle" disputes of territory, religion and local power.<ref>Holborn, p. 241.</ref> At the conference, Ferdinand cajoled, persuaded and threatened the various representatives into agreement on three important principles. The principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' provided for internal religious unity within a state: The religion of the prince became the religion of the state and all its inhabitants. Those inhabitants who could not conform to the prince's religion were allowed to leave, an innovative idea in the sixteenth century; this principle was discussed at length by the various delegates, who finally reached agreement on the specifics of its wording after examining the problem and the proposed solution from every possible angle. The second principle covered the special status of the ecclesiastical states, called the [[reservatum ecclesiasticum|ecclesiastical reservation]], or ''reservatum ecclesiasticum''. If the prelate of an ecclesiastic state changed his religion, the men and women living in that state did not have to do so. Instead, the prelate was expected to resign from his post, although this was not spelled out in the agreement. The third principle, known as ''[[Declaratio Ferdinandei|Ferdinand's Declaration]]'', exempted knights and some of the cities from the requirement of religious uniformity, if the reformed religion had been practiced there since the mid-1520s, allowing for a few mixed cities and towns where Catholics and Lutherans had lived together. It also protected the authority of the princely families, the knights and some of the cities to determine what religious uniformity meant in their territories. Ferdinand inserted this at the last minute, on his own authority.<ref>For a general discussion of the impact of the Reformation on the Holy Roman Empire, see Holborn, chapters 6<U+2013>9 (pp. 123<U+2013>248).</ref>

===Remaining problems===
After 1555, the Peace of Augsburg became the legitimating legal document governing the co-existence of the Lutheran and Catholic faiths in the German lands of the Holy Roman Empire, and it served to ameliorate many of the tensions between followers of the so-called Old Faith and the followers of Luther, but it had two fundamental flaws. First, Ferdinand had rushed the article on ''ecclesiastical reservation'' through the debate; it had not undergone the scrutiny and discussion that attended the wide-spread acceptance and support of ''cuius regio, eius religio''. Consequently, its wording did not cover all, or even most, potential legal scenarios. The ''Declaratio Ferdinandei'' was not debated in plenary session at all; using his authority to "act and settle,"<ref>Holborn, p. 241.</ref> Ferdinand had added it at the last minute, responding to lobbying by princely families and knights.<ref>Holborn, pp. 244<U+2013>245.</ref> 

While these specific failings came back to haunt the Empire in subsequent decades, perhaps the greatest weakness of the Peace of Augsburg was its failure to take into account the growing diversity of religious expression emerging in the so-called evangelical and reformed traditions. Other confessions had acquired popular, if not legal, legitimacy in the intervening decades and by 1555, the reforms proposed by Luther were no longer the only possibilities of religious expression: [[Anabaptists]], such as the Frisian [[Menno Simons]] (1492<U+2013>1559) and his followers; the followers of [[John Calvin]], who were particularly strong in the southwest and the northwest; and the followers of [[Huldrych Zwingli]] were excluded from considerations and protections under the Peace of Augsburg. According to the Augsburg agreement, their religious beliefs remained heretical.<ref>Holborn, pp. 243<U+2013>246.</ref>

===Charles V's abdication===

In 1556, amid great pomp, and leaning on the shoulder of one of his favorites (the 24-year-old [[William the Silent|William, Count of Nassau and Orange]]),<ref>Lisa Jardine, ''The Awful End of William the Silent: The First Assassination of a Head of State with A Handgun'', London, HarperCollins, 2005, ISBN 0007192576, Chapter 1; Richard Bruce Wernham, ''The New Cambridge Modern History: The Counter Reformation and Price Revolution 1559<U+2013>1610'', (vol. 3), 1979, pp. 338<U+2013>345.</ref> Charles gave away his lands and his offices. The [[Spanish empire]], which included [[Spain]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Naples]], [[Milan]] and Spain's possessions in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Americas]], went to his son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]]. His brother, Ferdinand, who had negotiated the treaty in the previous year, was already in possession of the Austrian lands and was also the obvious candidate to succeed Charles as Holy Roman Emperor.<ref>Holborn, pp. 249<U+2013>250; Wernham, pp. 338<U+2013>345.</ref>
 
Charles' choices were appropriate. Philip was culturally Spanish: he was born in [[Valladolid]] and raised in the Spanish court, his native tongue was Spanish, and he preferred to live in Spain. Ferdinand was familiar with, and to, the other princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Although he too had been born in Spain, he had administered his brother's affairs in the Empire since 1531.<ref>Holborn, pp. 243<U+2013>246.</ref> Some historians maintain Ferdinand had also been touched by the reformed philosophies, and was probably the closest the Holy Roman Empire ever came to a Protestant emperor; he remained nominally a Catholic throughout his life, although reportedly he refused last rites on his deathbed.<ref>See Parker, pp. 20<U+2013>50.</ref> Other historians maintain he was as Catholic as his brother, but tended to see religion as outside the political sphere.<ref> Holborn, pp. 250<U+2013>251.</ref> 

Charles' abdication had far-reaching consequences in imperial diplomatic relations with France and the Netherlands, particularly in his allotment of the Spanish kingdom to Philip. In France, the kings and their ministers grew increasingly uneasy about Habsburg encirclement and sought allies against Habsburg hegemony from among the border German territories, and even from some of the Protestant kings. In the Netherlands, Philip's ascension in Spain raised particular problems; for the sake of harmony, order, and prosperity Charles had not blocked the Reformation, and had tolerated a high level of local autonomy. An ardent Catholic and rigidly autocratic prince, Philip pursued an aggressive political, economic and religious policy toward the Dutch, resulting in a Dutch [[Dutch Revolt|rebellion]] shortly after he became king. Philip's militant response meant the occupation of much of the upper provinces by troops of, or hired by, [[Habsburg Spain]] and the constant ebb and flow of Spanish men and provisions on the so-called [[Spanish road]] from northern Italy, through the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] lands, to and from Flanders.<ref>Parker, p. 35.</ref>

==Cause of the war ==
[[File:Cologne War 1.svg|thumb|left|350px|alt=The territory is divided into nine sections; the main section borders the west bank of a wide river, and includes several important cities; other territories to the south and on the east bank of the river, are considerably smaller, and a crescent of territory south of Linz. Further north is a small section, still on the river, but separated from the main part of the territory. East of this section is "Vest Recklinghausen", and east of that is the Duchy of Westphalia. Nearby cities are, to the west, Nijmegen and Venlo, and to the east, Duisburg, D<U+00FC>sseldorf, and Dortmund. A big dot marks the location of Cologne, but it is distinguished from the territory by a border.|A map of the Electorate of Cologne showing key cities and towns. The city of Cologne was not a part of the territory of the Electorate, although it was part of the episcopal diocese. The gray lines are modern borders and the rivers are shown in their modern course; all boundaries are approximate.]]
As an ecclesiastical principality of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Electorate of Cologne]] ({{lang-de|Kurf<U+00FC>rstentum K<U+00F6>ln}} or ''{{lang|de|Kurk<U+00F6>ln}}'') included the temporal possessions of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]] ({{lang-de|Erzbistum K<U+00F6>ln}}). These included the so-called ''Oberstift'' (the southern part of the Electorate), the northern section, called the ''Niederstift'', the fiefdom of [[Vest Recklinghausen]] and the [[Duchy of Westphalia]], as well as several smaller territories surrounded by the nearby [[United Duchies of J<U+00FC>lich-Cleves-Berg|Duchies of Cleves, Berg, Julich and Mark]]. The Electorate did not include the city of [[Cologne]] itself, which, although part of the episcopal archdiocese, was not included in the Elector's temporal possessions. Cologne was an imperial city with its own set of rights and obligations, a separate government, and a separate status within the Holy Roman Empire. The Electorate was ruled by an archbishop [[prince-elector]] of the empire. As an archbishop, he was responsible for the spiritual leadership of one the richest [[Episcopal see|sees]] in the Empire, and entitled to draw on its wealth. As a prince-prelate, he stood in the highest social category of the Empire, with specific and expansive legal, economic, and juridical rights. As an Elector, he was one of the men who elected the Holy Roman Emperor from among a group of imperial candidates.<ref>Holborn, pp. 191<U+2013>247.</ref>

The Electorate obtained its name from the city, and [[Cologne]] had served as the capital of the archbishopric until 1288. After that, the archbishop and Prince-elector used the smaller cities of [[Bonn]], {{convert|30|km|0}} south of Cologne, and [[Br<U+00FC>hl, North Rhine-Westphalia|Br<U+00FC>hl]], {{convert|12|km|0}} south of Cologne, on the Rhine River, as his capital and residence; by 1580, both his residence and the capital were located in Bonn. Although the city of Cologne obtained its status as an [[free imperial city]] in 1478, the Archbishop of Cologne retained judicial rights in the city; he acted as a [[Vogt]], or [[High-reeve|reeve]], and reserved the right of [[Blutgericht|blood justice]], or ''Blutgericht''; only he could impose the so-called blood punishments, which included capital punishments, but also physical punishments that drew blood.<ref>{{de icon}} Leonard Ennen, ''Geschichte der Stadt K<U+00F6>ln'', Dusseldorf, Schwann'schen, 1880, pp. 291<U+2013>313.</ref> Regardless of his position as judge, he could not enter the city of Cologne except under special circumstances, and between the city council and the elector-archbishop, a politically and diplomatically precarious and usually adversarial relationship developed over the centuries.<ref>J. Lins. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04116a.htm ''Cologne''] In ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. Retrieved 11&nbsp;July 2009 from New Advent.</ref> (See also [[History of Cologne]] for more details.)

The position of archbishop was usually held by a [[kinship|scion]] of nobility, and not necessarily a priest; this widespread practice allowed younger sons of noble houses to find prestigious and financially secure positions without the requirements of priesthood.<ref>Lins, [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04116a.htm ''Cologne'']. New Advent.</ref> The archbishop and prince-elector was chosen by the [[cathedral chapter]], the members of which also served as his advisers. As members of a cathedral chapter, they participated in the [[Mass]], or sang the Mass; in addition, they performed other duties as needed. They were not required to be priests but they could, if they wished, take [[Holy Orders]]. As [[prebendary|prebendaries]], they received stipends from cathedral income; depending on the location and wealth of the cathedral, this could amount to substantial annual income.<ref>Encyclopedia Americana, "Chapter," New York, ''Encyclopedia Americana'', 1918, p. 514.</ref> In the Electorate, the Chapter included 24&nbsp;canons of various social ranks; they each had a place in the choir, based on their rank, which in turn was usually derived from the social standing of their families. <ref>{{de icon}} Ennen, pp. 291<U+2013>313.</ref>

===Election of 1577===
When his nephew, Arnold, died without issue, [[Salentin von Isenburg-Grenzau]] (1532<U+2013>1610) resigned from the office of Elector (September 1577) and, in December, married Antonia Wilhelmine d'Arenburg, sister of Charles d'Ligne, Prince of Arenberg.<ref>{{de icon}} Max Lossen, [http://de.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=ADB:Salentin&oldid=642667 Salentin], ''Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie'', herausgegeben von der Historischen Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Band 30 (1890), ab Seite 216, Digitale Volltext-Ausgabe in [http://de.wikisource.org/ Wikisource], (Version vom 14. November 2009, 19:56 Uhr UTC).</ref> Salentin's resignation required the election of a new archbishop and prince-elector from among the Cathedral Chapter. Two candidates emerged. Gebhard (1547<U+2013>1601) was the second son of William, Truchsess of Waldburg, known as William the younger, and Johanna von [[F<U+00FC>rstenberg (princely family)|F<U+00FC>rstenberg]]. He was descended from the ''Jacobin'' line of the [[House of Waldburg]]; his uncle was a cardinal, and his family had significant imperial contacts.<ref>{{de icon}} Max Lossen, [http://de.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=ADB:Gebhard_(Kurf%C3%BCrst_und_Erzbischof_von_K%C3%B6ln)&oldid=637669 Gebhard], ''Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie'', herausgegeben von der Historischen Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Band 8 (1878), ab Seite 457, Digitale Volltext-Ausgabe, Leipzig, 1878, (Version vom 6. November 2009, 02:02 Uhr UTC); {{de icon}} Michaela Waldburg, [http://www.waldburger.com/ Waldburg und Waldburger <U+2013> Ein Geschlecht steigt auf in den Hochadel des Alten Reiches] 2009, Accessed 15&nbsp;October 2009.</ref> The second candidate, [[Ernest of Bavaria|Ernst of Bavaria]] (1554<U+2013>1612), was the third son of [[Albert V, Duke of Bavaria]].<ref>Joseph Lins, "Cologne" and "Bavaria," [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/ ''Catholic Encyclopedia (New Advent)''], Accessed 5&nbsp;October 2009.</ref> As a member of the powerful [[House of Wittelsbach]], Ernst could marshal support from his extensive family connections throughout the Catholic houses of the empire; he also had contacts in important canonic establishments at Salzburg, Trier, W<U+00FC>rzburg, and M<U+00FC>nster that could exert collateral pressure.<ref>Samuel Macauley Jackson, "Communal Life," ''The New Schaff-Herzog encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge'', New York, Funk and Wagnalls, 1909, pp. 7<U+2013>8.</ref> 

Ernst had been a canon at Cologne since 1570. He had the support of the neighboring duke of [[J<U+00FC>lich]] and several allies within the Cathedral Chapter. Although supported by both the papacy and his influential father, a 1571 effort to secure for him the office of [[Coadjutor bishop|coadjutor]] of the electorate of Cologne had failed once Salentin had agreed to abide by the [[Council of Trent|Trentine proceedings]]; as the coadjutor bishop, Ernst would have been well-positioned to present himself as Salentin's logical successor.<ref>{{de icon}} Lossen, [http://de.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=ADB:Salentin&oldid=642667 Salentin]. (''ADB'').</ref>  Since then, however, he had advanced in other sees, becoming bishop of [[List of bishops and prince-bishops of Li<U+00E8>ge|Li<U+00E8>ge]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Freising]] and [[List of Bishops of Hildesheim|Hildesheim]], important strongholds of Counter-Reformation Catholicism. He was a career cleric, not necessarily qualified to be an archbishop on the basis of his theological erudition, but by his family connections. His membership in several chapters extended the family influence, and his status as a prebendary gave him a portion of revenues from several cathedrals.<ref>Jackson, p. 7.</ref> He had been educated by [[Jesuits]] and the papacy considered collaboration with his family as a means to limit the spread of Lutheran and Calvinist doctrines<U+2014>or, from some perspectives, heresies<U+2014>in the northern provinces.<ref>Lins, "Cologne", and "Bavaria".</ref> 

Also a younger son, Gebhard had prepared for an ecclesiastical career with a broad, [[Renaissance humanism|Humanist]] education; apart from his native German, he had learned several languages (including Latin, Italian, French), and studied history and theology.<ref>{{de icon}} Ennen, pp. 291<U+2013>294.</ref> After studying at the universities of [[Dillingen, Bavaria|Dillingen]], [[Ingolstadt]], [[Perugia]], [[Leuven|Louvain]] and elsewhere, he began his ecclesiastical career in 1560&nbsp;at [[Augsburg]]. His conduct at Augsburg caused some scandal; the bishop, his uncle, petitioned the Duke of Bavaria to remonstrate with him about it, which apparently led to some improvement in his behavior.<ref>{{de icon}} Lossen, [http://de.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=ADB:Gebhard_(Kurf%C3%BCrst_und_Erzbischof_von_K%C3%B6ln)&oldid=637669 "Gebhard"], ''(ADB)''.</ref> In 1561, he became a deacon at Cologne Cathedral (1561<U+2013>77), a canon of St. Gereon, the basilica in Cologne (1562<U+2013>67), a canon in [[Strassburg]] (1567<U+2013>1601), in [[Ellwangen]] (1567<U+2013>83), and in [[W<U+00FC>rzburg]] (1569<U+2013>70).

If the election had been left to the papacy, Ernst would have been the choice, but the Pope was not a member of the Cathedral Chapter and Gebhard had the support of several of the Catholic canons, and all the Protestant canons in the Chapter. In December 1577, he was chosen Elector and Archbishop of Cologne after a spirited contest with the papacy's candidate, Ernst, winning the election by two votes.<ref>{{de icon}} Ennen, pp. 291<U+2013>313. The Chapter had 24 members, and there may also have been skullduggery involved in keeping one of the members of the chapter from voting.</ref> Although it was not required of him, Gebhard agreed to undergo priestly ordination; he was duly consecrated in March 1578, and swore to uphold the Council of Trent's decrees.<ref>Goetz, pp. 439&ndash;440.</ref>

[[Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben]] (1551<U+2013>1637) was a Protestant canoness at the cloister in [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf-Gerresheim|Gerresheim]], today a district of [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]].

Translation by [[User:Jayen466]].</ref>  While he considered this, rumors of his possible conversion flew throughout the Electorate.<ref>{{de icon}} Ennen, pp. 291<U+2013>297.</ref> 

The mere possibility of Gebhard's conversion caused consternation in the Electorate, in the Empire, and in such European states as England and France. Gebhard considered his options, and listened to his advisers, chief among them his brother [[Karl, Truchsess von Waldburg]] (1548<U+2013>1593), and [[Adolf van Nieuwenaar|Adolf, Count von Neuenahr]] (1545<U+2013>1589). His opponents in the Cathedral Chapter enlisted external support from the Wittelsbachs in Bavaria and from the pope. Diplomats shuttled from court to court through the Rhineland, bearing pleas to Gebhard to consider the outcome of a conversion, and how it would destroy the Electorate; assuring him of support for his cause should he convert and hold the Electorate; threats to deter him, promises to encourage him, and offers and threats to assist or destroy him. The magistrates of Cologne vehemently opposed any possible conversion and the extension of parity to Protestants in the archdiocese. His Protestant supporters told Gebhard that he could marry the woman and keep the Electorate, converting it into a dynastic duchy. Throughout the Electorate, and on its borders, his supporters and opponents gathered their troops, armed their garrisons, stockpiled foodstuffs, and prepared for war.<ref>{{de icon}} Ennen pp. 291<U+2013>297; {{de icon}} Hennes pp. 25<U+2013>32.</ref> On 19&nbsp;December 1582, Gebhard announced his conversion, from, as he phrased it, the "darkness of the papacy to the Light" of the Word of God.<ref>{{de icon}} Ennen, p. 297; {{de icon}} Hennes, p. 32.</ref>

===Implications of his conversion===

The conversion of the Archbishop of Cologne to Protestantism triggered religious and political repercussions throughout the Holy Roman Empire. His conversion had widespread implications for the future of the Holy Roman Empire's electoral process established by the [[Golden Bull of 1356]]. In this process, seven [[Prince-elector|Imperial Electors]]<U+2014>the four secular electors of [[King of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Margrave of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], [[Count Palatine of the Rhine|the Palatinate]], and [[Duke of Saxony|Saxony]]; and the three ecclesiastical electors of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]], [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]], and [[Archbishopric of Cologne|Cologne]]<U+2014>selected an emperor. The presence of at least three inherently ''Catholic'' electors, who collectively governed some of the most prosperous ecclesiastical territories in the Empire, guaranteed the delicate balance of Catholics and Protestants in the voting; only one other elector needed to vote for a Catholic candidate, ensuring that future emperors would remain in the so-called Old Faith. The possibility of one of those electors shifting to the Protestant side, ''and'' of that elector producing an heir to perpetuate this shift, would change the balance in the electoral college in favor of the Protestants.<ref>Holborn, pp. 201<U+2013>247.</ref>

The conversion of the ecclesiastic see to a dynastic realm ruled by a Protestant prince challenged the principle of [[reservatum ecclesiasticum|ecclesiastical reservation]], which was intended to preserve the ecclesiastical electorates from this very possibility. The difficulties of such a conversion had been faced before: [[Hermann von Wied]], a previous prince-elector and archbishop in Cologne, had also converted to Protestantism, but had resigned from his office. Similarly, Gebhard's predecessor, Salentin von Isenburg-Grenzau had indeed married in 1577, but had resigned from the office prior to his marriage. Furthermore, the reason for his marriage<U+2014>to perpetuate his house<U+2014>differed considerably from Gebhard's. The House of Waldburg was in no apparent danger of extinction; Gebhard was one of six brothers, and only one other had chosen an ecclesiastical career.<ref>{{de icon}} Waldburg, ''Geschlecht''; {{de icon}} Heinz Wember, [http://www.gen.heinz-wember.de/waldburg/ Genealogical Table]. Accessed 20&nbsp;October 2009.</ref> Unlike his abdicating predecessors, when Gebhard converted, he proclaimed the Reformation in the city of Cologne itself, angering Cologne's Catholic leadership and alienating the Catholic faction in the Cathedral Chapter. Furthermore, Gebhard adhered not to the teachings of Martin Luther, but to those of [[John Calvin]], a form of religious observation not approved by the Augsburg conventions of 1555. Finally, he made no move to resign from his position as Prince-elector.<ref>Holborn, pp. 201<U+2013>247; Wernham, pp. 338<U+2013>345.</ref> 

Affairs became further complicated when, on 2&nbsp;February 1583, also known as ''[[Candlemas]]'',<ref>Frederick Holweck, [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03245b.htm "Candlemas"], ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. Accessed 29 October 2009.</ref> Gebhard married Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben in a private house in Rosenthal, outside of Bonn. After the ceremony, the couple processed to the Elector's palace in Bonn, and held a great feast. Unbeknownst to them, while they celebrated their marriage, [[Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg]] (1554<U+2013>1586), who was also a member of the Cathedral Chapter, and his soldiers approached the fortified [[Kaiserswerth]], across the river, and took the castle after a brief fight. When the citizens of Cologne heard the news, there was a great public celebration.<ref>{{de icon}} Hennes, pp. 47<U+2013>48.</ref>  

Two days after his marriage, Gebhard invested his brother Karl with the duties of ''Statthalter'' (governor) and charged him with the rule of Bonn.<ref>{{de icon}} Hennes, p. 48.</ref> He and Agnes then traveled to [[Zweibr<U+00FC>cken]] and from there, to the territory of Dillingen, near [[Solms-Braunfels]], where the Count, a staunch supporter, would help him to raise funds and troops to hold the territory; Adolf, Count von Neuenahr returned to the Electorate to prepare for its defense.<ref>{{de icon}} Hennes, pp. 48<U+2013>49.</ref> 

Gebhard clearly intended to transform an important ecclesiastical territory into a secular, dynastic duchy. This problematic conversion would then bring the principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' into play in the Electorate. Under this principle, all of Gebhard's subjects would be required to convert to his faith: ''his rule, his religion''. Furthermore, as a relatively young man, heirs would be expected. Gebhard and his young wife presented the very real possibility of successfully converting a rich, diplomatically important and strategically placed ecclesiastical territory of a prince-prelate into a dynastic territory that carried with it one of the coveted offices of imperial elector.<ref>Holborn, pp. 201<U+2013>247.</ref>

== Course of the war==

The war had three phases. Initially it was a localized feud between supporters of Gebhard and those of the Catholic core of the Cathedral Chapter. With the election of Ernst of Bavaria as a competing archbishop, what had been a local conflict expanded in scale: Ernst's election guaranteed the military, diplomatic, and financial interest of the Wittelsbach family in Electoral Cologne's local affairs. After the deaths of [[Louis VI, Elector Palatine]] in 1583&nbsp;and [[William the Silent]] in 1584, the conflict shifted gears again, as the two evenly matched combatants sought outside assistance to break the stalemate. Finally, the intervention of [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma]], who had at his command the Spanish Army of Flanders, threw the balance of power in favor of the Catholic side. By 1588, Spanish forces had pushed Gebhard from the Electorate. In 1588 he took refuge in Strassburg, and the remaining Protestant strongholds of the Electorate fell to Parma's forces in 1589.<ref>Ernest Alfred Benians, ''The Cambridge Modern History'', New York, Macmillan, 1905, pp. 713; Theodor V. Brodek, "Socio-Political Realities in the Holy Roman Empire," ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'', 1(3) (Spring, 1971), pp. 395<U+2013>405, 401<U+2013>405; Goetz, pp. 339<U+2013>441; Lins, "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04116a.htm Cologne]".</ref>

=== Cathedral feud ===

Although Gebhard had gathered some troops around him, he hoped to recruit support from the Lutheran princes.<ref name="Cologne">Lins, "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04116a.htm Cologne]".</ref> Unfortunately for him, he had converted to another branch of the Reformed faith; such cautious Lutheran princes as [[Augustus I, Elector of Saxony]], balked at extending their military support to Calvinists and the Elector Palatine was unable to persuade them to join the cause.<ref>Holborn, p. 288.</ref> Gebhard had three primary supporters. His brother, Karl, had married Eleonore, Countess of [[Hohenzollern]] (1551<U+2013>after 1598), and Gebhard could hope that this family alliance with the power-hungry Hohenzollerns would help his cause. Gebhard's long-time ally and supporter Adolf, Count von Neuenahr was a successful and cunning military commander whose army secured the northern part of the territory.<ref>{{de icon}} P. L.

In the first months after Gebhard's conversion, two competing armies rampaged throughout the southern portion of the Electoral territory in the destruction of the so-called [[destruction of the Oberstift|Oberstift]]. Villages, abbeys and convents and several towns, were plundered and burned, by both sides; Linz am Rhein and Ahrweiler avoided destruction by swearing loyalty to Salentin.<ref>{{de icon}} Hennes, p. 64.</ref> In the summer of 1583, Gebhard and Agnes took refuge, first at [[Vest]] in [[Vest Recklinghausen]], a [[fief]] of the Electorate, and then in the [[Duchy of Westphalia]], at Arensberg castle.

Initially, despite a few setbacks, military action seemed to go in Gebhard's favor, until October, 1583, when the Elector Palatine died, and Casimir disbanded his army and returned to his brother's court as guardian for the 10-year-old duke. In November, 1583, from his castle Arensberg in Westphalia, he wrote to [[Francis Walsingham]], adviser and spymaster to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]: "...Our needs are pressing, and you [Walsingham] and the Queen's other virtuous counsellors we believe can aid us; moreover, since God has called us to a knowledge of Himself, we have heard from our counsellors that you love and further the service of God.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Foreign, Elizabeth'', Volume 18: July 1583 <U+2013> July 1584 (1914), pp. 250<U+2013>265.

On the same day, Gebhard wrote also to the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, presenting his case: "Verily, the Roman Antichrist moves every stone to oppress us and our churches...."<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Foreign, Elizabeth'', Volume 18: July 1583 <U+2013> July 1584 (1914), pp. 250<U+2013>265.

[[Siege of Godesberg (1583)|Godesberg]], a small fortified town a few kilometers from the Elector's capital city of Bonn, was taken by storm in late 1583&nbsp;after a brutal siege; when cannonades failed to break the bastions, [[sappers]] tunneled under the thick walls and blew up the fortifications from below. The Catholic Archbishop's forces broke through the city gates and killed every defender except one, a Captain of the Guard who could prove he was a citizen of Cologne. The five miles of road between Godesberg and Bonn was filled with troops, so many, in fact, that it looked like a military camp.<ref>{{de icon}} Ennen, p. 159.</ref> At the same time, in one of the few set battles of the war, Gebhard's supporters won at [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] ({{lang-fr|Alost}}) over the Catholic forces of the Frederick of Saxe-Lauenburg, who had raised his own army and had entered the fray of his own accord a few months earlier.<ref>Goetz, pp. 439<U+2013>441.</ref> 

The Catholics offered Gebhard a great sum of money, which he refused, demanding instead, the restoration of his state.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Foreign, Elizabeth'', Volume 18: July 1583 <U+2013> July 1584 (1914), pp. 250<U+2013>265.

=== Engagement of outside military forces ===
{{Main|Dutch Revolt}}
The election of Ernst of Bavaria expanded the local feud into a more German-wide phenomenon. The pope committed 55,000&nbsp;crowns to pay soldiers to fight for Ernst, and another 40,000&nbsp;directly into the coffers of the new Archbishop.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Foreign, Elizabeth'', October 1583, 6<U+2013>10'', pp. 125<U+2013>134, [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=78993 Dr. Lobetius to Walsingham], October 9, 1583, Accessed 7&nbsp;November 2009.</ref> Under the command of his brother, Ernst's forces pushed their way into Westphalia, threatening Gebhard and Agnes at their stronghold at Arensburg. Gebhard and Agnes escaped to the rebellious provinces of the Netherlands with almost 1000&nbsp;cavalry, where Prince William gave them a haven in [[Delft]].<ref>Benians, p. 708.</ref> There, Gebhard solicited the impecunious William for troops and money.<ref>Holborn, pp. 288<U+2013>89; Sutherland, p. 606.</ref> After William's [[William the Silent#Assassination|assassination]] in July 1584, Gebhard wrote to Queen Elizabeth requesting assistance. Elizabeth responded toward the end of 1585, directing him to contact [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]], her deputy with the rebellious Dutch, and recently commissioned as the commander-in-chief of her army in the Netherlands.<ref>Eva Mabel Tenison, ''Elizabethan England'', 1932, p. 128. Some historians attribute Gebhard's failure to attract Elizabeth's support to the Queen's jealousy of the beauty of his wife, or her jealousy of any relationship Agnes might have had with Dudley. However, there is no record of any visit by Agnes to the royal Court, either in official or, more importantly, the unofficial sources which, motivated by salacious news, could be relied upon to sniff out even the most surreptitious bit of gossip.</ref> Elizabeth had her own problems with adherents of her cousin [[Mary I of Scotland|Mary Stuart]] and the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Spanish]].<ref>Benians, pp. 708<U+2013>710.</ref>

===Stalemate===

By late 1585, although Ernst's brother had made significant inroads into Electoral Cologne, both sides had reached an impasse. Sizable portions of the population subscribed to the Calvinist doctrine; to support them, Calvinist [[Switzerland]] and Strassburg furnished a steady stream of theologians, jurists, books and ideas.<ref>Benians, pp. 713<U+2013>714; Holborn, pp. 291<U+2013>247; Wernham, pp. 338<U+2013>345.</ref> The Calvinist barons and counts understood the danger of Spanish intervention: it meant the aggressive introduction of the Counter-Reformation in their territories. France, in the person of [[Henry III of France|Henry III]], was equally interested, since the encirclement of France by Habsburgs was cause for concern. Another sizable portion of the electorate's populace adhered to the old faith, supported by Wittelsbach-funded Jesuits.<ref>Po-chia Hsia, ''Social Discipline in the reformation,''New York, Routledge, 1989, ISBN 9780415011488, p. 71.</ref> The supporters of both sides committed atrocities of their own: in the city of Cologne, the mere rumor of Gebhard's approaching army caused rioters to murder several people suspected of sympathizing with the Protestant cause.<ref>{{de icon}} Hennes, pp. 71<U+2013>72.</ref>

Ernst depended on his brother and the Catholic barons in the Cathedral Chapter to hold the territory he acquired. In 1585, [[Munster]], [[Paderborn]], and [[Osnabr<U+00FC>ck]] succumbed to Ferdinand's energetic pursuit in the eastern regions of the electorate, and a short time later, [[Minden]].<ref>Edward Maslin Hulme, ''The Renaissance'', 1915, pp. 507<U+2013>510.</ref> With their help, Ernst could hold Bonn. Support from the city of Cologne itself was also secure. To oust Gebhard, though, Ernst ultimately had to appeal for aid to Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, who commanded Spanish forces in the Netherlands.<ref>Geoffrey Parker, ''The Flanders Army and the Spanish Road'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004, ISBN 978-0521543927. Chapters 1<U+2013>2.</ref> 

Parma was more than willing to help. The Electorate, strategically important to Spain, offered another land route by which to approach the rebellious northern Provinces of the Netherlands. Although the Spanish road from Spain's holdings on the Mediterranean shores led to its territories in what is today Belgium, it was a long, arduous march, complicated by the provisioning of troops and the potentially hostile populations of the territories through which it passed.<ref>Parker, ''Flanders'', Chapters 1<U+2013>2.</ref> An alternative route on the Rhine promised better access to the Habsburg Netherlands. Furthermore, the presence of a Calvinist electorate almost on the Dutch border could delay their efforts to bring the rebellious Dutch back to the Spanish rule and the Catholic confession. [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and his generals could be convinced to support Ernst's cause for such considerations. Indeed, the process of intervention had started earlier. In 1581, Philip's forces, paid for by papal gold, had taken [[Aachen]], which Protestants had seized; by the mid<U+2013>1580s, the Duke of Parma's forces, encouraged by the Wittelsbachs and the Catholics in Cologne, had secured garrisons throughout the northern territories of the Electorate.<ref>Jonathan I.

On the other side of the feud, to hold the territory, Gebhard needed the full support of his military brother and the very able Neuenahr. To push Ernst out, he needed additional support, which he had requested from Delft and from England. It was clearly in the interests of England and the Dutch to offer assistance; if the Dutch could not tie up the Spanish army in Flanders, and if that army needed a navy to supply it, Philip could not focus his attention on the English and the French.<ref>Wallace T.

Leicester's troops, professional and well-led, performed well but their usefulness was limited: Elizabeth's instructions to help Gebhard had not come with financial support and Leicester had sold his own plate and had exhausted his own personal credit while trying to field an army. Martin Schenck had seen considerable service in Spain's Army of Flanders, for the French king and for Parma himself. He was a skilled and charismatic soldier, and his men would do anything for him; reportedly, he could sleep in his saddle, and seemed indomitable in the field. Unfortunately, Schenck was little more than a land-pirate, a free-booter, and rascal, and ultimately he did Gebhard more harm than good, as his behavior in Westphalia and at the Battle of Werl demonstrated.<ref>Davies, pp. 235&ndash;236;  {{de icon}} P.L.

====Sack of Westphalia====

In late February 1586, [[Hermann Friedrich Cloedt (soldier)|Friedrich Cloedt]], whom Gebhard had placed in command of Neuss, and [[Martin Schenk von Nydedeck|Martin Schenck]] went to Westphalia at the head of 500&nbsp;foot and 500&nbsp;horse. After plundering [[Vest Recklinghausen]], on 1&nbsp;March they captured [[Werl]] through trickery.<ref>Benians, pp. 713; Charles Maurice Davies, ''The History of Holland and the Dutch Republic'', London, G. Willis, 1851, p. 233;{{de icon}} Hennes, pp. 153<U+2013>168.</ref> They loaded a train of wagons with soldiers and covered them with salt. When the wagons of salt were seen outside the city gates, they were immediately admitted, salt being a valued commodity. The "salted soldiers" then over-powered the guard and captured the town. Some of the defenders escaped to the citadel, and could not be dislodged. [[Claude de Berlaymont]], also known as [[Haultpenne]] after the name of his castle, collected his own force of 4000&nbsp;and besieged Schenck and Cloedt in Werl. Attacked from the outside by Haultpenne, and from the inside by the soldiers in the citadel, Schenck and Cloedt broke out of the city with their soldiers on 3&nbsp;March. Unable to break through the lines, they retreated into the city once more, but several of their soldiers did not make it into the city, and plundered the neighboring villages; 250&nbsp;local residents were killed. On 8&nbsp;March, Schenck and Cloedt loaded their wagons once again, this time with booty, took 30&nbsp;magistrates as hostages, and attacked Haultpenne's force, killing about 500&nbsp;of them, and losing 200&nbsp;of their own. Included in the hostages were the ''B<U+00FC>rgermeister'' Johann von Pappen and several other high-ranking officials; although von Pappen died during the retreat, the remaining hostages were released after the payment of a high ransom.<ref>{{de icon}} Hennes, p. 157, see also fn #1, p. 157.</ref> Schenck retreated to [[Venlo]] and Cloedt returned to the city of Neuss.<ref>{{de icon}} Hennes, pp. 156<U+2013>158.

=== Spanish intervention ===

To some extent, the difficulties both Gebhard and Ernst faced in winning the war were the same the Spanish had in subduing the Dutch Revolt. The protraction of the Spanish and Dutch war<U+2014>80 years of bitter fighting interrupted by periodic truces while both sides gathered resources<U+2014>lay in the kind of war it was: Enemies lived in fortified towns defended by Italian-style bastions, which meant the towns had to be taken and then fortified and maintained. For both Gebhard and Ernst, as for the Spanish commanders in the nearby Lowlands, winning the war meant not only mobilizing enough men to encircle a seemingly endless cycle of enemy artillery fortresses, but also maintaining the army one had and defending all one's own possessions as they were acquired.<ref>Parker, ''Flanders'', p. 17.</ref> The Cologne War, similar to the Dutch Revolt in that respect, was also a war of sieges, not of assembled armies facing one another on the field of battle, nor of maneuver, feint, and parry that characterized wars two centuries earlier and later. These wars required men who could operate the machinery of war, which meant extensive economic resources for soldiers to build and operate the siege works, and a political and military will to keep the machinery of war operating. The Spanish faced another problem, distance, which gave them a distinct interest in intervening in the Cologne affair.<ref>Parker, ''Flanders'', p. 18.</ref>

====Razing of Neuss====

{{Main|Destruction of Neuss (July 1586)}}

Gebhard's supporter, Adolf von Neuenahr, surrounded Neuss in March 1586, and persuaded Ernst's small garrison to capitulate. He refortified and restocked the city and placed young [[Hermann Friedrich Cloedt|Friedrich Cloedt]] (1555/60<U+2013>1586) in command of a garrison of 1600&nbsp;men, mostly Germans and Dutch soldiers. The town's fortifications were substantial; 100&nbsp;years earlier it had [[Siege of Neuss|resisted a lengthy siege]] by [[Charles the Bold]] (1433<U+2013>1477) of Burgundy, and between the fortifications, the natural defenses of rivers, and the garrison, it could withstand all but the most determined assaults.<ref>For its efforts, the emperor had granted Neuss the right to mint its own coins and to incorporate the imperial arms into its own coat of arms. {{de icon}} Hennes, pp. 185<U+2013>186.</ref> In July 1586, the Duke of Parma approached and surrounded the city; by some irony, Agnes' cousin, [[Karl von Mansfeld]]<ref> Some historians have claimed that Karl was her brother, but that has been refuted by more recent genealogical research into the history of the main lines and cadet lines of the family.  For example, see Hennes, p. 30. Agnes' father and Karl's father were sons of Ernst II, Count of Mansfeld zu Vorderort (1479<U+2013>1531) and his second wife, Dorothea zu Solm-Lich (1493<U+2013>1578, m 1512); See Miroslav Marek, [http://genealogy.euweb.cz/mansfeld/mansfeld2.html#KFA ''Descendants of G<U+00FC>nther II von Mansfeld-Querfurt (1406<U+2013>1475)''],  17&nbsp;March 2008 version, Accessed 11&nbsp;November 2009.</ref>  and his troops were a part of the Spanish force assembled against Neuss.<ref>For Mansfeld's presence, the number and distribution of troops, see {{de icon}} Hennes, p. 159.</ref> Parma had an impressive force at his command; in addition to Mansfeld's 2000&nbsp;troops, he had another 6000&nbsp;or so foot and [[Tercio]]s, 2000&nbsp;well-mounted, experienced Italian, Spanish and German soldiers, and some 45&nbsp;cannons, which he distributed on the redoubt across the river and on the heights a short distance from the city walls.<ref>Davies, p. 188, reported Parma had as many as 18,000&nbsp;troops; other sources settle the number at closer to 10,000: See {{de icon}} Hennes, pp. 158-159.</ref> According to the protocols of war generally accepted in 1586, Parma requested the capitulation of the city prior to the cannonade.<ref>Parker, ''Flanders'', p. 17.</ref> Cloedt declined to capitulate, politely. The next day, being the feast of [[Saint Jacob|St. James]], and the patron day for the Spanish, the bombardment was not initiated, although mendacious reports circulated in the Spanish camp that the Protestants had roasted two Spanish soldiers alive on the Catholic Holy day, a desecration which fanned their enthusiasm for the impending battle.<ref>{{de icon}} Hennes, p. 159.</ref>

The following day, Parma's artillery pounded at the walls for 30&nbsp;hours with iron cannonballs weighing 30<U+2013>50 pounds; in total, his artillery fired more than 2700&nbsp;rounds. The Spanish made several attempts to storm the city, each repelled by Cloedt's 1600&nbsp;soldiers. The ninth assault breached the outer wall. The Spanish and Italian forces entered the town from opposite ends and met in the middle.<ref>{{de icon}} Hennes, p. 163. In the prevailing codes of war, a town that capitulated would be placed under ''execution'', the quartering of troops at the town's expense. A town taken by storm, on the other hand, would be plundered and the garrison, killed. See Parker, ''Flanders'', p. 17.</ref>  Cloedt, gravely injured (his leg was reportedly almost ripped off and he had five other serious wounds), had been carried into the town. Parma's troops discovered Cloedt, being nursed by his wife and his sister. Although Parma was inclined to honor the garrison commander with a soldier's death by sword, Ernst demanded his immediate execution. The dying man was hanged from the window, with several other officers in his force.<ref>{{de icon}} The captain who executed Cloedt gave him a drink of wine and before hanging him from the window, told him to observe the slaughter of the soldiers whose deaths he had ordered.  Hennes, pp. 164.  His wife, his sister, and his small daughter were taken to Dusseldorf and handed into the care and custody of an ambassador there. {{de icon}} Hennes, p. 164-165.</ref> 

Parma made no effort to restrain his soldiers. On their rampage through the city, Italian and Spanish soldiers slaughtered the rest of the garrison, even the men who tried to surrender. Once their blood-lust was satiated, they began to plunder.<ref>Hennes, p. 165.</ref>  Civilians who had taken refuge in the churches were initially ignored, but when the fire started, they were forced into the streets and trapped by the rampaging soldiers. Contemporary accounts refer to children, women, and old men, their clothes smoldering, or in flames, trying to escape the conflagration, only to be trapped by the enraged Spanish; if they escaped the flames and the Spanish, they were cornered by the enraged Italians. Parma wrote to King Philip that over 4000&nbsp;lay dead in the ditches (moats). English observers confirmed this report, and elaborated that only eight buildings remained standing.<ref>{{de icon}} Hennes, p. 165 and {{de icon}} Philipson, p. 575.</ref>

===Siege warfare runs its course ===
Parma had gone to Neuss prepared for a major assault, and the resources of Spain's Army of the Netherlands quickly changed the balance in favor of Ernst. In 1586, Ernst's allies had secured Vest Recklinghausen, even though they had failed to catch the elusive Schenck, and they had reduced Neuss to a pile of rubble, proving their overwhelming fire-power. In 1587, they encircled and took the fortified towns in the ''Oberstift'', recapturing Bonn, Godesberg, and Linz am Rhein, and dozens of smaller fortified towns, villages and farmsteads throughout the countryside.<ref>Jeremy Black, ''European warfare, 1494<U+2013>1660'', New York, Routledge, 2002, pp. 114<U+2013>115. See also {{de icon}} Lossen, [http://de.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=ADB:Gebhard_(Kurf%C3%BCrst_und_Erzbischof_von_K%C3%B6ln)&oldid=637669 Gebhard] (ADB).</ref>  Throughout, soldiers from both parties marauded and plundered throughout the countryside, searching either for important officials, booty, or other valuables. On 12 November 1587, one of Walsingham's informants wrote, the "soldiers of ''Vartendonc'' (Martin Schenck) go out daily on excursions, doing very great harm in all places, for they have free passage every where. The other evening they went with 180&nbsp;horse to above Bonn, between Orchel and Linz (am Rhein), to make prisoner Count Salatin d'Issemburg (Salentin von Isenburg), but their design did not succeed, as he withdrew into a castle.<ref>Sophie Lomas, [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/source.aspx?pubid=829 Calendar of State Papers Foreign, Elizabeth], Volume 21, Part 1, 1927. British History Online.  pp. 409-429.</ref>  In early 1588, Gebhardt's supporters once more acquired Bonn; one of Walsingham's observers in the Palatinate, in Heidelberg, reported  that the Prince of Taxis had been slain outside of Bonn, with 300&nbsp;Spanish soldiers.<ref>Sophie Lomas, Elizabeth: April 1588, 16-30', [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=74808 Stafford to Walsingham], Heidelberg, 24&nbsp;April 1588.  Calendar of State Papers Foreign, Elizabeth, Volume 21, Part 1: 1586-1588 (1927), pp. 593-607.</ref>

By Spring 1588, Gebhard had run out of options. In 1583, he had refused the settlement offered to him after the conferences at Frankfurt and in Westphalia, counting on the support of the other Protestant electors. When their support did not materialize, he pursued diplomatic options with the French, the Dutch, and the English; these also were of limited help. After the destruction of Neuss in 1586, and the loss of the most of southern part of the Electorate in 1587, Rheinberg and its environs were the only territories of the Electorate he could claim, and much of this slipped from his grasp in 1588. He had exhausted his diplomatic, financial and military possibilities. His health problems (referred to as ''Gelenkenschmerz'', or joint pain) prohibited him from riding, which limited his ability to travel. In the spring of 1588, he relinquished his claim on the Electorate to the protection of Neuenahr and Martin Schenck, and retired to Strassburg.<ref>{{de icon}} Aloys Meister. ''Der Strassburger Kapitelstreit, 1583<U+2013>1592''. Strassburg: Heitz, 1899, pp. 325<U+2013>358.</ref> Neuenahr and Schenck continued to fight for him, but the former died in an artillery explosion in 1589, and the latter was killed at [[Assault on Nijmegen (1589)|Nijmegen]] that summer. Without them to defend Gebhard's claim on the Electorate, [[Battle of Rheinberg (1589)|Rheinberg]], the last Calvinist outpost of the northern Electorate, fell to Parma's force in 1589.<ref>Brodek, pp. 400<U+2013>401; {{de icon}} Hennes, pp. 177<U+2013>179.</ref>

== Aftermath ==
{{See|Counter-Reformation}}
After Gebhard's expulsion, Ernst assumed full charge of the Electorate of Cologne. In his later years, a [[papal nuncio]] took responsibilities for the financial administration of the archdiocese, and Ernst's nephew, [[Ferdinand of Bavaria]], was elected to the Cathedral Chapter, the Wittelsbach heir-apparent. When Ernst died in 1612, the Cathedral Chapter duly elected his nephew to the position and Wittelsbachs held the Electorate until 1761.<ref> Benians, p. 713; Brodek, pp. 400<U+2013>405; Lins, "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04116a.htm Cologne]".</ref> Ernst's victory, both in winning the election in 1583, and in convincing the assembly of other electors to accept him in 1585, confirmed him as the new archbishop of Cologne and gave the [[Wittelsbach]] family a foothold on the northern Rhine.<ref>Brodek, pp. 400<U+2013>401; Goetz, pp. 439<U+2013>441.</ref> 

Ernst's rule, and that of his four Wittelsbach successors, strengthened the position of his family in Imperial politics.<ref>Thomas Brady, et al., ''Handbook of European history, 1400<U+2013>1600''.  Vol. 2, Leiden, Netherlands: Brill Academic Publishers, 1995, 978-9004097612, p. 365; Lins, "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04116a.htm Cologne]".</ref> The victory of the Catholic party further consolidated the Counter-Reformation in the northwest territories of the Holy Roman Empire, especially in the bishoprics of [[Munster]], [[Paderborn]], [[Osnabruck]] and [[Minden]], which were bordered by Protestant territories.<ref>Robert W. Scribner, "Why Was There No Reformation in Cologne?" ''Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research'', 49(1976): pp. 217<U+2013>241.</ref> Once Ernst's brother or such allies as the Duke of Parma regained control, Jesuits efficiently identified any recalcitrant Protestants and converted them to Catholicism. The Counter-Reformation was thoroughly applied in the lower Rhineland, with the goal that every Protestant, whether Lutheran or Calvinist, would be brought to the Catholic fold. For their efforts, the Spanish acquired important bridgeheads on the Rhine River, securing a land route to the rebellious northern provinces, which helped to extend an already long war of secession well into the next century. In addition, the use of troops from the Spanish Netherlands, on the Catholic side, and the Netherlands, on the Protestant side, internationalized the German confessional problem, which came to a crisis in the [[Thirty Years War]]s, and was not resolved until the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648.<ref>[[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Geoffrey Parker]], ''''The Thirty Years Wars, 1618<U+2013>1648''.
