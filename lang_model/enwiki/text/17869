'''Panchayatana puja''' ([[IAST]] ''{{IAST|Pa<U+00F1>c<U+0101>yatana p<U+016B>ja}}'') is the system of [[Puja (Hinduism)|worship]] ('puja') in the [[Smarta]] [[sampradaya]] of [[Hinduism]]. It is said to have been introduced by [[Adi Shankara]], the 8th century [[Common Era|CE]] [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu philosopher]]. It consists of the worship of five deities: [[Shiva]], [[Vishnu]], [[Devi]], [[Surya]] and [[Ganesha]]. Depending on the tradition followed by Smarta households, one of these deities is kept in the center and the other four surround it. Worship is offered to all the deities. The five are represented by small [[murtis]], or by five kinds of stones, or by five marks drawn on the floor.<ref name="lexicon">http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/lexicon/</ref> 
One is placed in the center as the devotee's preferred God, [[Ishta Devata]], and the other four in a square around it.<ref name="lexicon"/>

==Smartas==
Philosophically, all are seen by [[Smartas]] as equal reflections of the one [[Saguna Brahman]], (i.e., a personal God with form) rather than as distinct beings. This arrangement is also represented in Smarta temples, with one in a central sanctum, and the others installed in smaller shrines.<ref name="lexicon"/>

==Udasi==
The [[Udasi]] sect follows the Panchayatana traditions. These followers, like mainstream [[Sikhs]], believe in Sri [[Guru Granth Sahib]] (Sacred Text of the Sikhs) which the Udasis interpret according to Vedanta philosophy and therefore take part in both Nirguna Pooja (of reading Gurbani from Sikh texts and fixing the mind on the omnipresent, indescribable and infinite God, the cause of all forms) but also respect Saguna Swaroopa (the physical and metaphysical forms of God) by Pooja and [[Aarti]] traditions of Sanatana Dharma.
