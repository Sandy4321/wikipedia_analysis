The '''John Tangeman House''' is a historic house in the city of [[Wyoming, Ohio|Wyoming]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]].  The city's best house of its style, the residence was once home to a prosperous factory owner, and it has been named a [[historic site]]. 

==Architecture==
As Wyoming's best [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] residence, the Tangeman House conveys a clear picture of pre-Civil War Wyoming, especially when seen from the front.<ref name=dohp>Owen, Lorrie K., ed.  ''Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places''.  Vol. 1.  [[St. Clair Shores, Michigan|St. Clair Shores]]: Somerset, 1999, 678-679.</ref>  Built of brick on a stone [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]], the two-[[storey|story]] house is covered with an [[asphalt]] roof and features additional elements of wood and stone.  A large front porch surrounds the entrance and the rest of the three-[[bay (architecture)|bay]] facade.  Decorative [[corbel]]ling supports the edges of the roof, which features twin chimneys near its center;<ref>[http://ohsweb.ohiohistory.org/ohpo/nr/details.aspx?refnum=86001650 Tangeman, John, House], [[Ohio Historical Society]], 2007.  Accessed 2013-12-23.</ref> it has the overall shape of a [[hip roof]].  Significant elements of the porch include the [[chamfer]]red pillars, [[molding (decorative)|decorative molding]], and arches with elaborate [[latticework]].<ref name=dohp />

==Historic context==
Good transportation is a leading reason for Wyoming's prosperity.  The city lies near the old pre-statehood road that connected [[Cincinnati]] with locations farther north, such as [[Hamilton, Ohio|Fort Hamilton]] and [[Battle of Fallen Timbers|Fallen Timbers]].  Curves in the road were cut off in 1806, forming a new road that is today followed by [[Ohio State Route 4|Springfield Pike]] through central Wyoming.  Improvements in the 1830s only enhanced its importance.<ref name=mps>McCauley, Jennifer.  ''[http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/64000660.pdf National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: The Historic Resources of Wyoming, Ohio]''.  [[National Park Service]], 1985-08-16.  Accessed 2011-02-26.</ref>{{rp|9}}  By this time, another mode of transportation had become significant: the [[Miami and Erie Canal]] was built a short distance to the east in 1828, and the village of [[Lockland, Ohio|Lockland]] grew up along its side.  Railroads reached the city in 1851 with the construction of the [[Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway (1846<U+2013>1917)|Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Dayton Railroad]] on the border between Lockland and Wyoming.<ref name=mps />{{rp|10}}

Because of Wyoming's proximity to the industry of Lockland, its easy transportation to the booming city of Cincinnati, and its pleasant scenery, many wealthy industrialists purchased local farms and built grand country houses.<ref name=mps />{{rp|11}}  Most such houses were built in the Wyoming Hills area, west of Springfield Pike;<ref name=mps />{{rp|12}} growth in this area continued until the coming of the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=mps />{{rp|2}}  As the owner of the Tangeman Paper Company in Lockland, John Tangeman was among the first industrialists to build a house in Wyoming.  He resided on the property for more than thirty years, beginning at its completion in 1857 and continuing until 1891 at least.<ref name=dohp />

==Historic site==
In 1979, a local [[historic preservation]] group began a citywide survey to identify Wyoming's historic buildings,<ref name=mps />{{rp|3}} and this effort culminated with a [[multiple property submission]] of eighteen houses, the [[Wyoming Presbyterian Church]], and one [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985.<ref name=mps />{{rp|18}}  Along with all but one of the other properties, the Tangeman House was listed on the Register in the following year, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture and because of its connection to Tangeman.<ref name=nris />
