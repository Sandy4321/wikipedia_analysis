'''Carrier Strike Group Eleven''', abbreviated '''CSG-11''' or '''CARSTRKGRU 11''', is one of six [[U.S. Navy]] [[carrier strike group]]s currently assigned to the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]].  U.S. Navy carrier strike groups are employed in a variety of roles, all of which involve gaining and maintaining sea control.<ref>{{cite web | title= The Carrier Strike Group | url= http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/carriers/powerhouse/cvbg.asp | work= Navy Data | publisher= U.S. Navy | year= 2011 | accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref> 

Carrier Strike Group Eleven is currently based at [[Naval Air Station North Island]], and it typically deploys to the [[U.S. Seventh Fleet]] operating in the Western Pacific (WESTPAC)  and the [[U.S. Fifth Fleet]] in the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Persian Gulf]].  The current [[flagship]] for Carrier Strike Group Eleven is the [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|nuclear-powered aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Nimitz|CVN-68}}.

==Overview==
=== Historical background===
In 1973, a major reorganization of the U.S. Navy's cruiser-destroyer force resulted in Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla Nine's (CRUDESFLOT NINE) re-designation as Cruiser Destroyer Group Five (CDG5). The primary mission of CRUDESFLOT NINE during the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] era had been to ensure the effective employment of approximately 60 cruisers and destroyers in the [[United States Seventh Fleet]]. By January 1973, with the end of hostilities in Vietnam, Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla Nine had expended nearly 80,000 rounds in Naval gunfire support missions. This offshore firepower, and the equally important role of search and rescue coordination, were vital parts of the extensive Naval presence in the [[South China Sea]].<ref name=CSG11History>{{cite web | title= History of Carrier Strike Group Eleven | url= http://www.public.navy.mil/surfor/ccsg11/Pages/Ourship.aspx | work= Carrier Strike Group Eleven | publisher= U.S. Navy | year= 2010 | accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref>

The ''Nimitz'' carrier battle group (CVBG) participated in [[Operation Eagle Claw|Operations Blue Light]], the [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1981)|1981 Gulf of Sidra incident]], [[Operation Earnest Will]], [[Operation Desert Storm]], as  well as [[NATO]] exercise [[Northern Wedding|''Northern Wedding 86'']].<ref name=NimitzDANFS>{{cite DANFS | title = Nimitz| url = http://www.history.navy.mil/DANFS/n5/nimitz.htm | accessdate = 2010-08-25 }}</ref>  In the Summer of 1992, the U.S. Navy instituted a concept which mandated greater task group integration of naval air and surface warfare assets into a more permanent carrier battle group structure. Instead of routinely changing the cruisers, destroyers, and frigates assigned to each carrier battle group, there was an attempt made to affiliate certain escorts more permanently with the carriers they escorted. Each of the Navy's 12 existing carrier battle groups was planned to consist of an aircraft carrier; an embarked carrier air wing; cruiser, destroyer, and frigate units; and two nuclear-powered attack submarines.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Naval Institute Guide to The Ships and Aircraft of the U.S. Fleet, 15th ed. |last= Polmar |first= Norman |year= 1993 |publisher= [[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]] |location= [[Annapolis, Maryland]] |isbn= 1-55750-675-2 |pages= 32, 36 (Table 6-5) |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>  

Beginning in 1993, the ''Nimitz'' carrier strike group (CSG) participated in [[Operation Southern Watch]], [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].<ref name=NimitzDANFS/>  The ''Nimitz'' carrier battle group received a [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] in recognition of its support U.S. naval operations involving Operation Southern Watch (OSW) and the [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis]] between 13 December 1995 and 3 May 1996, and it also received a [[Navy Unit Commendation]] recognition of its support of combat air operation for Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) between 4 April to 1 May 2003.<ref name=NimitzDANFS/>  On 1 October 2004 Cruiser Destroyer Group Five was re-designated Carrier Strike Group Eleven (CARSTRKGRU 11).<ref>{{cite web |first= Polmar |last= Norman |title= Naval Institute Guide to the Ships and Aircraft of the U.S. Fleet, 18th edition |url= http://www.usni.org/store/books/aircraft-reference/naval-institute-guide-ships-and-aircraft-us-fleet-br18th-edition |work= 18th edition |publisher= [[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]] |location= [[Annapolis, Maryland]] |pages= 36<U+2013>40 |doi= 978-1591146858 |year= 2005 |accessdate= 2010-12-01|quote=Registration required. }}</ref>

===Command structure===
{{Further|[[Carrier Strike Group]]}}
Commander Carrier Strike Group Eleven (COMCARSTRKGRU 11) serves as Immediate Superior-in-Command (ISIC) for the ships and units assigned to the Carrier Strike Group.  Acting as an Operational Commander, COMCARSTRKGRU 3 exercises oversight of unit-level training, integrated training, and readiness for assigned ships and units, as well as maintains administrative functions and material readiness tracking for ships and squadrons assigned to the group. 

Carrier Strike Group Eleven reports to Commander, [[U.S. Third Fleet]] as one of six carrier strike groups currently assigned to the [[United States Pacific Fleet]].  CARSTRKGRU 11's [[Composite Unit Training Exercise|pre-deployment training and certification]] comes under the operational control (OPCON) of the U.S. Third Fleet.  When deployed overseas, Carrier Strike Group Nine comes under the command authority of the [[U.S. Seventh Fleet]] when operating in the Western Pacific (WESTPAC) and the [[U.S. Fifth Fleet]] when operating in the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Persian Gulf]].

The carrier strike group is an operational formation. Administratively the ships and aircraft of the strike group also report to [[U.S. Navy type commands|Navy type command]]s. The aircraft carrier ''Nimitz'', the guided missile cruiser {{USS|Princeton|CG-59}}, and [[Destroyer Squadron 23]] are under the administrative authority of Commander, Naval Surface Forces Pacific.<ref>{{cite web | title= Pacific Theater Surface Ships (by Homeport) | url= http://www.public.navy.mil/surfor/Pages/PacificTheaterShips.aspx | work= Our Ships and Commands | publisher= Commander Naval Surface Forces, U.S. Pacific Fleet | year= 2010 | accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= Support Commands | url= http://www.public.navy.mil/surfor/Pages/SupportCommands.aspx | work= Ships and Commands | publisher= Commander Naval Surface Forces, U.S. Pacific Fleet | year= 2010 | accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref>  [[Carrier Air Wing Eleven]] is under the administrative authority of [[Commander, Naval Air Forces|Commander, Naval Air Force Pacific]].
===Force composition in 2011===
[[File:USS Nimitz (CVN-68).jpg|thumb|right|USS ''Nimitz'' (CVN-68), flagship, Carrier Strike Group Eleven]]
U.S. Navy carrier strike groups typically consist of an [[Supercarrier|aircraft carrier]] ([[flagship]]), an embarked  [[carrier air wing]], at least one [[Ticonderoga class cruiser|''Ticonderoga''-class guided-missile cruiser]], and a [[DESRON|destroyer squadron]]. As of 2011, Carrier Strike Group Eleven is composed of the following units:<ref name=CSG-11home>{{cite web | title= Carrier Strike Group Eleven | url= http://www.public.navy.mil/surfor/ccsg11/Pages/default.aspx | work= Carrier Strike Group Eleven | publisher= U.S. Navy | year= 2010 | accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= Home | url= http://www.public.navy.mil/surfor/cds23/Pages/default.aspx | work= COMDESRON TWO THREE | publisher= U.S. Navy | year= 2010 | accessdate=2010-12-07}}</ref>

{{Main|Carrier Strike Group Eleven 2004<U+2013>2009 operations}}
Since its redesignation as Carrier Strike Group Eleven in 2004, the ''Nimitz'' carrier strike group has undertaken three overseas dedeployments to provide combat air support for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, as well as regional maritime security operations and counter-piracy operations off the Horn of Africa.  This included a special WESTPAC surge deployment during 2007 in accordance with the U.S. Navy's Fleet Response Plan (FRP) when the [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokohama-based]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63}} underwent a yard overhaul.  CARSTRKGRU 11 has also participated in several mult-lateral naval exercises, including Valiant Shield 2007, Malabar 07-2 with India, Key Resolve/Foal Eagle 2008 off Korea, and USWEX 09, as well as participation in Theater Security Cooperation activities with various regional naval forces.

Conducting these carrier qualifications with CVW 11 ensured Nimitz maintained its certification.  CVW 11 embarked 12 aircraft and a third of its crew for the underway period.<ref>{{cite web | author= Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Peter Merrill and Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Apprentice Andrew Jandik | title= USS ''Nimitz'', Carrier Air Wing 11 Underway for Carrier Quals | url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=54617 | work= NNS100713-04 | publisher= USS ''Nimitz'' Public Affairs  | date= July 13, 2010 | accessdate=2010-10-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author= Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Nichelle Whitfield, USN | title= Air Wing Completes Qualifications, Departs ''Nimitz'' | url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=54665 | work= NNS100715-21 | publisher= USS ''Nimitz'' Public Affairs  | date= July 15, 2010 | accessdate=2010-10-19}}</ref>  Beginning in September 2010, ''Nimitz'' began preparations for its upcoming docking planned incremental availability (DPIA) at [[Naval Base Kitsap]] in Washington.<ref>{{cite web | author= Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Peter Merrill, USN | title= ''Nimitz'' Hosts Homeport Change Fair | url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=53441 | work= NNS100519-07 | publisher= USS Nimitz Public Affairs | date= May 19, 2010 | accessdate=2010-10-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author= Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Peter Merrill, USN | title= ''Nimitz'' Offloads More Than 1,200 Tons of Ordnance | url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=56013 | work= NNS100519-07 | publisher= USS ''Nimitz'' Public Affairs | date= September 16, 2010 | accessdate=2010-10-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author= Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Peter Merrill, USN | title= ''Nimitz'' Onloads Hundreds of Vehicles for Transit from San Diego to Bremerton | url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=57533 | work= NNS101203-22 | publisher= USS ''Nimitz'' Public Affairs | date= December 3, 2010 | accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref>
