'''Turkish Airlines Flight 5904''' flight crashed some time between 00:30 and 01:00 on 7 April, 1999, 9 minutes after taking off in poor weather conditions, near [[Ceyhan]] in [[Turkey]].  The flight had brought pilgrims returning from [[Hajj]] back to [[Adana <U+015E>akirpa<U+015F>a_Airport|Adana]] and was flying empty to [[King_Abdulaziz_International_Airport|Jeddah]] to pick up some more. It seems probable that the pilot anti-icing system was not operated as the result of a missed pre-flight checklist item.
