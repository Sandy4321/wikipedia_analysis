'''Pisgah Crater''', also '''Pisgah Volcano''', is a young [[volcano|volcanic]] [[cinder cone]] located in the [[Mojave Desert]] east of the [[California]] city of [[Barstow, California|Barstow]] on the [[National Old Trails Highway]].  It can be found at {{coor dms|34|44|47|N|116|22|30|W|}}.  

Pisgah Volcano is the youngest vent in the [[Lavic Lake]] volcanic field.  There may have been activity at this site as recent as 2,000 years ago, though more likely 20,000 to 50,000 years ago.  It is too young for the commonly used [[potassium-argon dating|potassium-argon]] dating technique (usable on specimens over 100,000 years old), and no charred organic material for [[radiocarbon dating]] has been found. However, lava at nearby (and similarly active) [[Amboy Crater]] is interbedded with Bristol Playa sediments at a depth of about 9 meters (30 feet); these sediments are approximately 100,000 years old.  Recent [[argon-argon dating]] reveals an age of approximately 18,000 years <U+00B1> 5,000 years (~90% certainty) for the most recent flow (Sylvester et al., 2002, Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, v. 92, p. 1333-1340).

[[Lava]] flows extend 18 km (11 miles) to the west and 8 km (5 miles) to southeast of the cone, containing [[basalt]] primarily of the [[pahoehoe]] texture, with some a'a.  The flows contain numerous [[lava tube]]s and caves.

Currently, the crater stands 98 meters (321 feet) off the surrounding High Desert terrain, and has a base diameter of 488 meters (1,600 feet).  It has lost much of its original cinder cone shape to ongoing [[aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] mining operations, in addition to minor natural [[erosion]].

The crater and much of the surrounding lava field are located on private property.  Despite this, the lava tubes in the area are a somewhat popular and easily accessible destination for [[caving]].
