'''Port Austin Lighthouse''' (or '''Port Austin Reef Light''') is a [[lighthouse]] off the shore of [[Lake Huron]], about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} north of [[Port Austin, Michigan|Port Austin]], [[Huron County, Michigan|Huron County]] [[Michigan]] sitting on a rocky [[reef]] ([[shoal]]), which is just north of the tip of [[the Thumb]] and a real hazard to navigation.

==History==
The original plans were for this lighthouse to be built on shore. The crib was built in [[Tawas City, Michigan|Tawas]].<ref>[http://www.lighthousecentral.com/lighthouse_gallery.php4?lighthouse=Port%20Austin%20Reef%20Light Lighthouse Central, Port Austin Lighthouse Photographs, History and Directions, ''The Ultimate Guide to East Michigan Lighthouses'' by Jerry Roach] (Publisher: Bugs Publishing LLC - July 2006). ISBN 0-9747977-1-5; ISBN 978-0-9747977-1-7.</ref>

The Station was established and the light first lit in 1878, and its pier was modified in 1899.  It is still operational and is automated. The foundation materials are a pier, and the tower is constructed of yellow brick, with buff markings.  It is [[octagon]]al, {{convert|60|ft|m}} tall, with an attached [[Lighthouse keeper|keeper]] house.  However, the focal plain is {{convert|76|ft|m}}.  It originally had a fourth-order [[Fresnel lens]] {{IPAc-en|f|r|e<U+026A>|<U+02C8>|n|<U+025B>|l}} by Henry Lepaute of Paris and installed in 1899.  The optic was 300&nbsp;mm glass.   In 1985 the lens was replaced by a 12-volt solar-powered [[ML-300|Tideland Signal 300&nbsp;mm]] acrylic optic,<ref>[http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/closeups/illumination/acrylic/300mm/300mm.htm Tideland 300 mm optic, Terry Pepper, Seeing the Light.]</ref> which eliminated the need to maintain the submarine cable.<ref name="terrypepper.com"/><ref>[http://www.lighthousedepot.com/database/uniquelighthouse.cfm?value=522 Lighthouse depot on Port Austin Light.]</ref>

==Current status and activities==
In 1990, volunteers from the Port Austin Reef Light Association engaged in an "heroic effort" to oust a colony of seagulls that had taken over the building, and then screened and reroofed it. Restoration efforts continue.<ref>[http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080520/SPECIAL01/80519001 Detroit News, Interactive map on Michigan lighthouses.]</ref>
Decking has been covered with galvanized metal shingles, and painted in the bright red that is historically accurate. Railings were affixed to the access ladder, and safety chains edging the deck were replaced. Installed also were a new brick chimney and 18 new windows. In 1990, PARLA's license to renovate the structure was extended through 2020.<ref name="terrypepper.com"/>

Current restoration continues by the Port Austin Reef Light Association.<ref>[http://www.portaustinarea.com/directory/view.php?id=97&page=0&cat=9&subcat=0&subsubcat=0 Port Austin Reef Light Association.]</ref>

The light is not open for tours.<ref>{{cite uscghist|MI}}</ref> It is a long and difficult trip to the light, which is always hindered by the reef, and often by the fog.<ref>[http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=172 Description Port Austin Light] at lighthousefriends.com</ref> However, it is possible to photograph the lighthouse from shore, although it takes a long lens or digital zoom.<ref>[http://www.lighthousesrus.org/HuronW.htm Interactive map, list, information for lighthouses in North and West Lake Huron.]</ref>

The light was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in September 2011.<ref name=NRHP/> The site includes adjacent bottom lands.<ref>[http://www.michiganlighthouse.org/Lighthouses/lighthouse_detail.php78.htm Michigan Lighthouse project, Port Austin Reef Light.]</ref> A two story on shore [[lighthouse keeper]]'s house still exists.<ref>[http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/huron/portaustin/pt-austin05.htm Terry Pepper, Seeing the Light, Photography of Port Austin Lighkeeper's house.]</ref>

In June 2011, the [[General Services Administration]] made the Port Austin Light (along with 11 others) available at no cost to public organizations willing to preserve them.<ref>{{cite news|title=For sale: Waterfront property; cozy, great views, plenty of light, needs TLC|url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/07/12/for-sale-waterfront-property-cozy-great-views-plenty-of-light-needs-tlc/?hpt=hp_t2|accessdate=12 July 2011|newspaper=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Beatty|first=MaryAnne|title=GSA Making 12 Historic Lighthouses Available at No Cost to Public Organizations Willing to Preserve Them|url=http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/286133|work=GSA Website|publisher=US General Services Administration|accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>

On July 19, 2012 it was announced that the Port Austin Reef Lighthouse Association, a Michigan non-profit organization, will take ownership of the Port Austin Light Station on Lake Huron.
