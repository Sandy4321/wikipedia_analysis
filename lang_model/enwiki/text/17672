The '''Clan Mackay''' ([[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]: ''Mac Aoidh'') is an ancient and once powerful [[Scottish clan]] from the country's far north in the [[Scottish Highlands]], but with roots in the old province of [[Moray]]. They played a powerful force in politics beginning in the 14th century, supporting [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]]. Mackays became famous for strength, courage and skill in soldiering and were involved in endless clan battles against Keiths, Rosses, Gunns, Sinclairs, Sutherlands and others, and wars abroad. In the centuries that followed they were very anti-[[Jacobitism|Jacobite]]. They played an important role in the military activities of both Scotland and Europe. The [[Highland Clearances]] had dire ramifications for the clan, but since then they spread throughout the world and have provided it many famous and influential descendants.

==Battles & History==
===Origins of the Clan===
[[Image:Dalriada.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Map of [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]] at its height, c. 580<U+2013>600, in green. [[Picts|Pictish]] regions are marked in yellow.]]
The Mackays are believed to descend from the ancient tribes that existed in [[Scotland]] called the [[Picts]]. However the name is also found from ancient times in [[Holland]] where the Mackays became noted for their many branches in the region. Each house acquiring a status and influence that was envied by the princess of the region. The name Mackay is also found in [[Ireland]] from ancient times when several tribes from the northern area of Ireland, which was once part of one of the ancient Scottish kingdoms known as [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]], moved across the sea to Scotland. The Mackays in Scotland were seated in [[Strathnaver]] north of [[Sutherland]]. Although the exact origin of the Clan Mackay is unknown it is generally accepted that they belonged to the early [[Celt]]ic population of Scotland, although, from their proximity to the [[Norsemen|Norse]] immigrants, it is not at all improbable that latterly the two races became largely blended. <ref name="MackayBook1">History of the House and Clan of Mackay by Robert Makay (1829). p.27 - 49</ref>

The most popular and accepted theory as to the origins of the chieftenship of the Clan Mackay, is that the chief was descended from the [[Pictish]] Royal House of MacEth. It is said that the chief, James Mackay and his clansmen were originally from Ireland, following two brothers deported after battle loss for the kingship in 335 A.D. They settled in [[Moray]] but were dispersed principally north to the [[Strathnaver]] region by order of King [[Malcolm IV of Scotland]] in 1160 who defeated [[MacHeths|Malcolm MacEth, Earl of Ross]] whose daughter Gormflaith married the Norse Harold, [[Earl of Caithness]]. Their son was called [[MacHeths|MacHeth]] who was raised to the chieftenship of his Clan Mackay in 1250.<ref name="MackayBook1"/>

==Chief==

[[Clan chief]]: The Rt. Hon. [[Hugh Mackay, 14th Lord Reay|Lord Hugh William Mackay of Reay]], 14<sup>th</sup> [[Lord Reay]], [[Mackay Baronets|Baronet of Strathnaver]], [[Clan chief|Chief]] of Clan Mackay (or ''MacAoidh''), also [[Baron]] Mackay van [[Ophemert]] and [[Zennewijnen]], of the [[Netherlands]].<ref>[http://www.burkes-peerage.net/familyhomepage.aspx?FID=0&FN=REAY burkes-peerage.net]</ref>

==Varrich Castle==

[[Varrich Castle]] was the ancient seat of the chief of Clan Mackay but the chief later moved to Tongue House.

==Geography==

The Mackay homeland is [[Strathnaver]], extending along the north coast from [[Caithness]] in the east, through [[Ross and Cromarty]] (before 1889, [[Ross]] and [[Cromartyshire|Cromarty]]), to [[Cape Wrath]] in the west. The southerly extent was the country of [[Sutherland]]. Dr Gary Mackay (see [[#External links|External links]]) describes the territory as ''stretched from [[Assynt]] in the west to [[Loch Naver]], to the borders of [[Ross]] and just west of present day [[Thurso]]''. Mackays of old were, however, to be found from the [[Orkney Islands]] to the [[Outer Hebrides]].

==The pipes==

The 'Clan Tune' is Mackay's March. (According to J. Logan, there are several tunes associated with Clan Mackay.  The 'salute', which is usually cited as the clan tune, is titled "Brattach bhan Chlann Aoidh" or, in English, "The White Banner of Mackay".  v. Logan, J. & [[R. R. McIan|McIan, R.R]]., The Clans of the Scottish Highlands - The Costumes of the Clans, London, 1847).  The Clan has been associated with [[bagpipe|piping]] since time immemorial. Mackays were hereditary pipers to the MacKenzies. Kenneth Mackay became famous at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815 by playing ''War or Peace'' in front of the regimental square of the Cameron Highlanders during a cavalry charge.

Although pipers were not officially recognized as such until 1854, a Mackay piper was the first piper known to have served in a regular British army unit, in 1633 being transferred from the (continental) Scots Brigate to the (later) Royal Scots.

The bagpipe music collection of Angus Mackay of [[Raasay]] (in 1843 appointed the first Piper to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]) is the beginning of standardization of the ''classical'' piping form, the piobaireachd (pibroch). He wrote ''The Piper's Assistant'' (pre-1847) and ''The Tutor for the Highland Bagpipe'' (1878). He was preceded by William Mackay and in 1843 translated and revised his ''Complete Tutor for the Great Highland Bagpipe'' (1840).

==The name==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2008}}
The name is a translation to [[English language|English]] of the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] "Mac Aoidh," meaning 'Son of Aodh.' or 'Son of Fire'  The feminine form is "Nic Aoidh,' meaning 'Daughter of Aoidh.' or 'Daughter of Fire'  The feminine prefix 'nic' is the genitive form of 'ni.'  The genitive form of 'mac' is 'mhic' (pronounced 'vik'), but this is not usually prefixed to root names that begin with a vowel.  Instead, a slender vowel (usually 'i') is inserted behind the principal vowel, and an 'h' is placed before the initial vowel when it is used on its own (without a prefix):  Aodh (pronounced [<U+026F><U+0263>] in Middle Irish) > hAoidh (pronounced [h<U+026F><U+0263><U+00B4>] in Gaelic (see below) or approximately "hoo-ey" in English - which is why the personal name Aodh/Aoidh/hAoidh is translated as 'Hugh' and 'Huey'), but no 'h' when there is a prefix - Mac/Nic Aoidh (Aoidh, pronounced "oo-ey"). See end of next paragraph for details on prounnciation in the original Gaelic.

Records from the 12th century show the spellings Mac Aedh, Mac Aed, and Mac Heth. 'Aed' is simply a transcription of the Gaelic alphabet form - with a dot over the 'd', to indicate aspiration - to the Roman alphabet, in which the dot is replaced by 'h'.  The genitive case form of 'Aed[dot]/Aedh' is 'hAeid[dot]/hAeidh'.  'Heth' is a transcription of the genitive 'hAeidh', minus the 'i', to Scots/Norn/English - in which 'dh' represents the same sound as soft 'th' (or [<U+00F0>]). Note thou<U+0261>h that the pronunciation of "dh" changes from [<U+00F0>] to [<U+0263>] (the same as "gh") in the MIddle Irish period.

The reader is reminded that all these form are basically attempts to render into Old Scots, Old English, and other languages, as accurately as possible, the sounds of what was then the Scottish dialect of Old Irish -- which, as a ''Celtic'' language, was very different from Scots, English and Norn(all Germanic languages). Originally the name ''Aedh'' would have been pronounced as /<U+026F>i<U+00F0>/ in Old Irish, then /<U+026F>i<U+0263>/ in Middle Irish, then later /<U+026F>ij/ in early Scots Gaelic. The sound /<U+026F>/ is a back unrounded high vowel with no precise equivalent in English or Scots, so it was variously rendered /i/ ''ee'', /aj/ ''eye'' or /e/ ''ay'' in English and Scots.

The variant spellings 'Mackay', 'MacKaye' and 'McKay' are common, and M'Kay is found in older records. Other variants include Y, Aytho, MacIye, McKie, Makky, Macky, MacK, McKoy, Maky, McKye, McKeye, Mackie, Mckie, Mackey, Key,VonKey, Kay,VonKay, McKy, McAy, McCei, MacCay, McCay, McCoy, Cay, Coy, Caw, McCaa, McCaw, McGaa, McGaw, Mackee, Makgie, [[McKee]], [[McGhee Tartan|McGee]], McGhee, Gee, [[McKee]], MacHery, Mahery, Ison, Eason, Easson, MacQuay, Quay, MacQuoid, Quoid, MacQuaid, Quaid, MacQuade, Quade, MacAvoy, McAvoy, Avoy, and many others.

The Forbes and Urquhart families may be closely related, and records before 1715 show close friendships among the three families. The most well known Mackay is Sir Tim Mackay who was assassinated by Englishmen David Taylor and Phillip Benson.

The clan Mackay are also said by some to be descended from Siol Mhoirgunn or Clan Morgan &mdash; a claim in some doubt &mdash; so Morgan and Gunn are often included in the list of allied names. There are (or were) Mackay septs of Clan Chattan and other families.

The form 'nic' is a contraction of 'nighean mhic,' meaning "daughter of the son of", as well as the genitive form of prefix 'ni', which means "daughter of".

Dwelly's Illustrated Gaelic to English Dictionary

Aedh (Aodh, in modern form) is an ancient name of a fire god and, ultimately, is the Proto-Indo-European word for fire.  In Scotland, Man and Ireland, the modern form of the name was Anglicised and Scotticised as 'Hugh' and 'Huey', from the genitive forms - hAodh ("hyoo" or "hyookh") and hAoidh ("hyoo-ee").
