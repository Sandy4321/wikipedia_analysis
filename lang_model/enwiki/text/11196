==Young Guns==

===Competition Rules===

There were eight participating universities in the 2014 Young Guns competition. These teams were divided into two pools (the FNB pool and the Steinhoff pool) and played the other teams in the pool once over the course of the season, either home or away.

Teams received four points for a win and two points for a draw. Bonus points were awarded to teams that scored four or more tries in a game, as well as to teams that lost a match by seven points or less. Teams were ranked by log points, then points difference (points scored less points conceded).

The top two teams in each pool qualified for the title play-offs. In the semi-finals, the teams that finished first had home advantage against the teams that finished second in their respective pools. The winners of these semi-finals played each other in the final.<ref name="Varsity Young Guns Competition Rules 2012">{{cite web | url=http://www.varsitycup.co.za/index.php/footer-links-5/vc-competition-rules/4804-varsity-young-guns-competition-rules-2012 | title=Varsity Young Guns Competition Rules 2012 | publisher=varsitycup.co.za | accessdate=9 Apr 2012}}</ref>
