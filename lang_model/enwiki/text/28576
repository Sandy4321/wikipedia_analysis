'''''South of Heaven''''' is the fourth [[studio album]] by the American [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]]. Released on [[July 5]], [[1988 in music|1988]], the album was the band's second collaboration with [[record producer]] [[Rick Rubin]], whose production skills on Slayer's previous album ''[[Reign in Blood]]'' had helped the band's sound evolve.

''South of Heaven'' was Slayer's second album to enter the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and their last  to be  distributed by [[Def Jam Records]]. The release peaked at number 57 and in 1992 was awarded a [[RIAA Certification|gold certification]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. In order to offset the pace of the group's previous album, Slayer deliberately slowed down the album's [[tempo]]. In contrast to their previous albums, the band utilised undistorted guitars and toned-down vocals. While some critics praised this musical change, others&mdash;more accustomed to the style of earlier releases&mdash;were disappointed. Despite this, the songs "Mandatory Suicide" and the title track became permanent features of the band's live setlist. 

==Background==
''South of Heaven'' was recorded in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] with ''[[Reign in Blood]]'' producer Rick Rubin. ''[[PopMatters]]'' reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production "shoves [Dave] [[Dave Lombardo|Lombardo]]'s drumming right up front in the mix."<ref name="The Devil in Music">{{cite web|title =The Devil in Music| author = Begrand, Adrien| publisher= [[PopMatters]]|date=[[2004-01-23]]|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/s/slayer-soundtrack.shtml|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> Guitarist [[Jeff Hanneman]] has since said that ''South of Heaven'' was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they "couldn't top ''[[Reign in Blood]]''", and that whatever they recorded would be "compared to that album", he believed they "had to slow down", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since.<ref name="OralHistory">{{cite web| title= An exclusive oral history of Slayer|publisher=Decibel Magazine|url= http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features_detail.aspx?id=4566|accessdate=2006-12-03}}</ref> Guitarist [[Kerry King]] cited the need to "keep people guessing" as another reason for the musical shift.<ref name="KingUltimateGuitar">{{cite web|title=Slayer's Kerry King: The Art Of Writing Songs That Nobody Else Can Write|author=Matera, Joe|publisher=UltimateGuitar.com|date=[[2006-08-04]]|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/slayers_kerry_king_the_art_of_writing_songs_that_nobody_else_can_write.html|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> "In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on ''Reign in Blood'', Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole", according to Slayer's official biography. "They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums."<ref name="AboutSlayer">{{cite web | title =About|author=|publisher=Slayer.net|date=|url=http://www.slayer.net/site.php#about|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref>

King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his "most lackluster". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Describing himself as "probably the odd man out at that point", he admitted he "didn<U+2019>t participate as much because of that."  Hanneman said: "We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell." King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He feels  vocalist [[Tom Araya]] moved too far away from his regular vocal style, and "added too much singing."<ref name="OralHistory"/> Drummer Dave Lombardo has since observed: "There was fire on all the records, but it started dimming when ''South of Heaven'' came into the picture. And that's me personally. Again, I was probably wanting something else."<ref name="DaveGASP">{{cite web|title="Dave Saves"|author=Baronas, Mike|publisher=GASPetc.com|date=[[2006-08-09]]|url= http://www.gaspetc.com/metal_inter_lombardo.html|accessdate=2007-03-25}}</ref>

[[Judas Priest]]'s "Dissident Aggressor" is the only [[cover version]] to appear on a Slayer studio album. The song was chosen due to its war-themed lyrics. Hanneman described the track as "more just like one of those odd songs that a lot of people didn't know, but it was a favorite of Kerry and I, so we just picked that one."<ref name="KNACHanneman">{{cite web | title = A Rare Interview With Slayer Shredder Hanneman, Gripping Firmly onto the Reigns of Metal | author = Davis, Brian    | publisher = Knac.com  | date =  | url = http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=3153 | accessdate = 2007-03-17 }}</ref> Meanwhile, "Cleanse the Soul" has been heavily criticized by King who said that he hates the track: "That's one of the black marks in our history, in my book. I just fucking think it's horrible. [Laughs] I hate the opening riff. It's what we call a 'happy riff.' It's just like 'la-lala-la-la-la.' I can't see myself playing it, but after that, where it gets heavier, I like that section. If we ever did a medley, I'd put part of that in there."<ref name="Maniacs2006">{{cite web | title = Slayer's Tom Araya Wants To Sue Demiricous For Plagiarism | author =  | publisher = [[Blabbermouth.net]] | date = [[2006-08-15]] | url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=56518 | accessdate = 2007-03-17}}</ref>

In November 2003, Slayer issued the box set ''[[Soundtrack to the Apocalypse]]''. Comprising three discs and one DVD, the third disc includes a number of rarities. Amongst the tracks on the third disc was an early version of "South of Heaven", recorded at Hanneman's home.<ref>{{cite web|title=Slayer: 'Soundtrack To The Apocalypse' Track Listing Revealed!|author= |publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=[[2003-10-22]]|url= http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=16170|accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref>

Slayer's official biography states that "some critics praised the album as demonstrating Slayer's desire to grow musically and avoid repeating themselves".<ref name="AboutSlayer"/> Alex Henderson of ''[[All Music Guide]]'' described the record as "disturbing and powerful",<ref name="AMGReview"/> while Joe Matera of ''Ultimate Guitar'' deemed the album a slight departure; he wrote that while the pace was slowed down, it "didn't sacrifice any of the heaviness inherent in Slayer's music."<ref name="KingUltimateGuitar">{{cite web|title=Slayer's Kerry King: The Art Of Writing Songs That Nobody Else Can Write| author =Matera, Joe|publisher=UltimateGuitar.com|date=[[2006-08-04]]|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/slayers_kerry_king_the_art_of_writing_songs_that_nobody_else_can_write.html|accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref>

Reviewing the 2003 Slayer box set ''[[Soundtrack to the Apocalypse]]'', Adrien Begrand of ''[[PopMatters]]'' described the album as "their most underrated, and on this set, its five selections show how highly the band thinks of the record."<ref name="The Devil in Music"/> ''KNAC.com'''s Peter Atkinson was also positive, saying the album has a "grandiosity and imposing presence" which makes the record "so magnificent".<ref name="KNACReview">{{cite web|title=KNAC Review - Christ Illusion|author=Atkinson, Peter| publisher=KNAC.com|date=[[2006-07-24]]|url=http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=4789|accessdate = 2007-05-29}}</ref> [[Grave (band)|Grave]]'s Ola Lindgren and [[Bolt Thrower]]'s [[Karl Willetts]] both rate ''South of Heaven'' as amongst the top five albums of all time,<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 5 Albums|author=|publisher=Live 4 Metal|date=2004|url= http://web.archive.org/web/20060427210837/http://www.live4metal.com/top5albums.htm|accessdate=2007-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bolt Thrower|author=|publisher=Nocturnal Horde|date=[[2005-12-13]]|url= http://www.nocturnalhorde.com/interview115.html|accessdate=2007-03-25}}</ref> while [[Max Kolesne]] of Brazilian death metal group [[Krisiun]] remembers hearing the song "Silent Scream" for the first time: "It just blew me away.

Slayer's official biography states: "The new sounds disappointed some of the band's fans who were more accustomed to the style of earlier releases."<ref name="OralHistory"/> Michael Roberts of Westworld Online said this was due to some of the numbers moving "at the sludgier speed of [[Black Sabbath]]."<ref>{{cite web|title= Westworld Online interview with Kerry King|author=Roberts, Michael|publisher=Slayersaves.com|date=2000-08|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20061018174731/http://www.slayersaves.com/interviews_kerry3.htm|accessdate=2007-03-25}}</ref> Araya commented that the "album was a late bloomer<U+2014>it wasn't really received well, but it kind of grew on everybody later."<ref name="OralHistory"/>

==Cover versions==
The title track and the song "Mandatory Suicide" have received various cover interpretations, particularly on Slayer tribute albums. Toni Ferguson recorded string quartet adaptations of both tracks on the album ''The String Quartet Tribute to Slayer: The Evil You'', with the former cover being described as having "menacing chord shifts" by ''[[All Music Guide]]'''s Johnny Loftus.<ref>{{cite web|title= The String Quartet Tribute to Slayer: The Evil You - Review|author=Loftus, Johnny|publisher=[[All Music Guide]]|date=|url= http://wc04.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:4v6tk6kxtkrk~T1|accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref>

A live rendition of "South of Heaven" was also included on a bonus DVD which came with the group's 2007 re-release of ninth studio album ''[[Christ Illusion]]'', shot in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] during 2006's [[The Unholy Alliance (tour)|Unholy Alliance]] tour.<ref>{{cite web|title= 	 	 Slayer: Video Interview With Jeff Hanneman Available|author= |publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=[[2007-08-07]]|url= http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=78320|accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref>

"Behind the Crooked Cross" is rarely played live as Hanneman hates the track, though King has always wanted to play it "because it<U+2019>s got a cool intro" despite it not being his favourite song. King said "that<U+2019>s fine" when speaking of the situation, noting "there are songs that he wants to play that I always shoot down."<ref name="OralHistory"/> "Ghosts of War" isn't King's favourite song either, which he attests "everybody always wants to hear" performed live. He confessed; "I like the ending, you know, I like the big heavy part and I always say, "Let's put the heavy ending at the end of 'Chemical Warfare' and just do the last half.
