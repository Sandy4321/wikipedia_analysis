'''Back-contamination''' is the informal but widely employed name for the hypothetical introduction of microbial [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] organisms into [[Earth]]'s [[biosphere]]. It is assumed that any such contact will be disruptive or at least have consequences over which human beings will have little control.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The threat of back-contamination from the [[Moon]] was the main reason for quarantine procedures adopted for the [[Apollo program]], up until the completion of [[Apollo 14]]. Astronauts and lunar samples were quarantined in the [[Lunar Receiving Laboratory]].

The likelihood that a human being or any other animal could literally acquire an alien [[virus]] is effectively nil, as viruses are host specific. This does not mean that extraterrestrial microbes cannot act upon one pathogenically: [[spores]] might use an organism's body as hosts, while the ingestion of [[bacteria]] in any form could produce toxic chemicals. When human beings ingest contaminated food, for example, they are not acquiring a virus in the manner of the flu but the experience may still be lethal because of toxic compounds.

Further, the possibility exists that a microbe might aggressively metabolize some Earth resource were it introduced here, altering [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric conditions]] or the [[water cycle]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
