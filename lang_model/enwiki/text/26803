{{see also|Nestorianism}}
In modern times the Mongols are primarily [[Buddhist]], but in previous eras, especially during the time of the Mongol "empire" (13th&ndash;14th centuries), they were primarily shamanist and had a substantial minority of Christians, many of whom were in positions of considerable power.<ref>[[Richard Foltz|Foltz, Richard]], ''Religions of the Silk Road'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition, 2010 ISBN 978-0-230-62125-1</ref><ref>[http://mcel.pacificu.edu/easpac/2003/may.php3 E-Aspac<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Overall, Mongols were highly tolerant of most religions, and typically sponsored several at the same time. Many Mongols had been proselytized  by [[Church of the East|Nestorian Christians]] since about the 7th century,<ref>Weatherford, p. 28</ref> and some tribes' primary religion was Nestorian.  In the time of [[Genghis Khan]], his sons took Christian wives of the [[Kerait]] clan, and under the rule of Genghis Khan's grandson, [[M<U+00F6>ngke Khan|M<U+00F6>ngke]], the primary religious influence was Christian.  

The practice of Nestorian Christianity was somewhat different from that practiced in the West, and Europeans tended to regard Nestorianism as heretical for its beliefs about the nature of [[Jesus]]. However, the Europeans also had legends about a figure known as [[Prester John]], a great Christian leader in the East who would come to help with the [[Crusades]].  One version of the legend connected the identity of Prester John with a Christian Mongol leader, [[Wang Khan|Toghrul]], leader of the Kerait clan.

When the Mongols conquered northern China, establishing the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271&ndash;1368), Nestorian Christianity was re-introduced to China after a gap of centuries. As the Mongols further expanded, the Christian sympathies of the court, primarily through the influential wives of the khans, led to changes in military strategy.  When the Mongols [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|conquered Baghdad in 1258]], many of the citizens of the city were massacred, but the Christian inhabitants were spared.  As the Mongols further encroached upon Palestine, there were some attempts at forming a [[Franco-Mongol alliance]] with the Christians of Europe against the Muslims.

Mongol contacts with the West also led to many missionaries, primarily [[Franciscan]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]], traveling eastward in attempts to convert the Mongols to Roman Catholicism.

The Mongols had been [[proselytism|proselytised]] since about the 7th century.<ref>"The Silk Road", [[Frances Wood]], p.118 "[[William of Rubruck|William of Ribruk]] was shocked to discover that there were, indeed, Christians at the Mongol court, but that they were schismatic Nestorians (...)

Early in the eleventh century their ruler had been converted to Nestorian Christianity, together with most of his subjects; and the conversion brought the Keraits into touch with the Uighur Turks, amongst whom were many Nestorians", Runciman, p.238</ref> the [[Naimans]], the [[Merkit]], the [[<U+00D6>ng<U+00FC>d]],<ref>For these four tribes: Roux, p.39-40</ref> and to a large extent the [[Kara-Khitan Khanate|Kara Khitan]] (who practiced it side-by-side with Buddhism),<ref>Grousset, ''Empire'', p. 165</ref> were Nestorian Christian.<ref>"In 1196, Genghis Khan succeeded in the unification under his authority of all the Mongol tribes, some of which had been converted to Nestorian Christianity" "Les Croisades, origines et cons<U+00E9>quences", p.74</ref>

[[Genghis Khan]] himself was a [[Shamanist]], but was tolerant of other faiths. When, as the young Tem<U+00FC>jin, he swore allegiance with his men at the Baljuna Covenant around 1200, there were representatives of nine tribes among the 20 men, including "several Christians, three Muslims, and several Buddhists."<ref>Weatherford, p. 58</ref>
His sons were married to Christian princesses of the Kerait clan who held considerable influence at his court.<ref name="Runciman-246"/>  Under the Great Khan [[M<U+00F6>ngke Khan|Mongke]], Genghis's grandson, the main religious influence was that of the Nestorians.<ref>Under Mongka "The chief religious influence was that of the Nestorian Christians, to whom Mongka showed especial favour in memory of his mother Sorghaqtani, who had always remained loyal to her faith" Runciman, p.296</ref> 

Some of the major Christian figures among the Mongols were: 
* [[Sorghaghtani Beki]], daughter in law of [[Genghis Khan]] by his son [[Tolui]], and mother of [[M<U+00F6>ngke Khan|M<U+00F6>ngke]], [[Kublai Khan]], [[Hulagu Khan]] and [[Ariq Boke]], who were also married to Christian princesses;<ref name=Runciman-246>Runciman, p.246</ref><ref>"Sorghaqtani, a Kerait by birth and, like all her race, a devout Nestorian Christian", Runciman, p.293</ref><ref>"His [Mongka's] principal Empress, Kutuktai, and many other of his wives also were Nestorians", Runciman, p.296</ref> 
* [[Doquz Khatun]], wife of Hulagu and mother of the Ilkhan [[Abaqa Khan|Abaqa]],<ref>"This remarkable lady was a Kerait princess, the granddaughter of [[Toghrul Khan]] and cousin, therefore of Hulagu's mother. She was a passionate Nestorian, who made no secret of her dislike of Islam and her eagerness to help Christians of every sect", Runciman, p.299</ref> who for his part married [[Maria Palaiologina]], daughter of Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]] in 1265.

==Practice==
[[File:NestorianTombstoneIssykKul1312.jpg|thumb|Nestorian tombstone with inscriptions in [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], found in [[Issyk Kul]], dated 1312]]
According to popular anthropologist [[Jack Weatherford]], because the Mongols had a primarily nomadic culture, their practice of Christianity was different from what might have been recognized by most Western Christians.  The Mongols had no churches or monasteries, but claimed a set of beliefs that descended from the [[Apostle Thomas]], which relied on wandering monks. Further, their style was based more on practice than belief.  The primary interest in Christianity for many, was the story that Jesus had healed the sick and survived death, so the practice of Christianity became interwoven with the care of the sick.  Jesus was considered to be a powerful shaman, and another attraction was that the name Jesus sounded like ''Yesu'', the Mongol number "9".  It was a sacred number to the Mongols, and was also the name of Genghis Khan's father, [[Yesugei]].<ref>Weatherford, p. 135</ref> However, somewhat in contradiction to Weatherford, there is written evidence of a permanent Nestorian church in Karakorum<ref>[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/rubruck.html#court_christians William of Rubruck, ''Journey'', chapter 15 (Christians at the court of the Khan): "but I do know that they do not celebrate mass in a tent, but in a substantial [J: permanent&#93; church."]</ref> and archeological evidence for another permanent Nestorian church in [[Olon S<U+00FC>me]].<ref name = "halbertsma">[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/1887/12444/2/Thesis.pdf Tjalling Halbertsma, ''Nestorian remains of Inner Mongolia : discovery, reconstruction and appropriation'', p. 88ff]</ref> The use of non-permanent (yurt) churches is also well-documented.<ref name = "halbertsma"/>

Again according to Weatherford, the Mongols also adapted the Christian cross to their own belief system, making it sacred because it pointed to the four directions of the world. They had varied readings of the Scriptures, especially feeling an affinity to the wandering [[Israelites|Hebrew tribes]].  Christianity also allowed the eating of meat (different from the vegetarianism of the Buddhists). And of particular interest to the hard-drinking Mongols, they enjoyed that the consuming of alcohol was a required part of church services.<ref>Weatherford, p. 29. "Jesus was considered an important and powerful shaman, and the cross was sacred as the symbol of the four directions of the world.  As a pastoral people, the steppe tribes felt very comfortable with the pastoral customs and beliefs of the ancient Hebrew tribes as illustrated in the Bible.  Perhaps above all, the Christians ate meat, unlike the vegetarian Buddhists; and in contrast to the abstemious Muslims, the Christians not only enjoyed drinking alcohol, but they even prescribed it as a mandatory part of their worship service."</ref>

Women in Mongolia were known to indicate their faith by wearing an amulet inscribed with a cross, or to be tattooed with a cross.<ref>{{cite book|title=Jingjiao: the Church of the East in China and Central Asia|editors=Malek, Roman; Hofrichter, Peter|year=2006|isbn=978-3-8050-0534-0|work=[[Monumenta Serica Institute]]|publisher=Steyler Verlagsbuchhandlung GmbH| chapter=Sorkaktani Beki: A prominent Nestorian woman at the Mongol Court|author=Li, Tang}}</ref>

==Kerait and Naiman Christian tribes==
The [[Kerait]] tribe of the Mongols were converted to Nestorianism early in the 11th century. Other tribes evangelized entirely or to a great extent during the 10th and 11th centuries were the [[Naimans|Naiman]] tribe. The [[Kara-Khitan Khanate]] also had a large proportion of Nestorian Christians, mingled with Buddhists and Muslims.

[[File:WangKhan.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction of the Kerait ruler "[[Wang Khan]]" ("King and Khan")<ref>Roux, p.107</ref> [[Ong Khan|Toghrul]] as "Prester John" in "Le Livre des Merveilles", 15th century.]]
An account of the conversion of the Kerait is given by the 13th century [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]] historian, Gregory [[Bar Hebraeus]], who documented a 1009 letter by bishop [[Abdisho of Merv]] to the catholicos [[John VI the Affluent|John VI]] which announced the conversion of the Keraits to Christianity.<ref>Roux, ''L'Asie Centrale'', p.241</ref>  According to Hebraeus, in the early 11th century, a Kerait king lost his way while hunting in the high mountains. When he had abandoned all hope, a saint appeared in a vision and said, "If you will believe in Christ, I will lead you lest you perish."  The king returned home safely, and when he later met Christian merchants, he remembered the vision and asked them about their faith. At their suggestion, he sent a message to the Metropolitan of [[Merv]] for priests and deacons to baptize him and his tribe. As a result of the mission that followed, the king and 20,000 of his people were baptized.<ref name="grousset" /><ref>Moffett, ''A History of Christianity in Asia'' pp. 400-401.</ref>

The legend of [[Prester John]] was also connected with the Nestorian rulers of the Kerait. Though the identity of Prester John was linked with individuals from other areas as well, such as India or Ethiopia, in some versions of the legend, Prester John was explicitly identified with the Christian Mongol [[Wang Khan|Toghrul]].

==Relations with Christian nations==

[[File:Hulagu and Doquz-Qatun in Syriac Bible.jpg|thumb|[[Hulagu]] and his wife [[Doquz Khatun]] in a Syriac Bible]]
Some military collaboration with Christian powers took place in 1259-1260. [[Hetoum I]] of [[Cilician Armenia]] and his son-in-law [[Bohemond VI of Antioch|Bohemond VI]] of Antioch had submitted to the Mongols, and, as did other vassal states, provided troops in the Mongols' expansion. The founder and leader of the Ilkhanate in 1260, [[Hulagu]], was generally favourable to Christianity: his mother was Christian, his principal wife [[Doquz Khatun]] was a prominent Christian leader in the Ilkhanate, and at least one of his key generals, [[Kitbuqa]], was also Christian.<ref name=grousset>Grousset, p. 581.</ref> A later descendant of Hulagu, the Ilkhan [[Arghun]], sent the Nestorian monk [[Rabban Bar Sauma]] as an ambassador to Western courts to offer an alliance between the Mongols and the Europeans. While there, Bar Sauma explained the situation of the Nestorian faith to the European monarchs:

{{quote|"Know ye, O our Fathers, that many of  our Fathers (Nestorian missionaries since the 7th century) have gone into the countries of the Mongols, and Turks, and Chinese and have taught them the Gospel, and at the present time there are many Mongols  who are Christians. For many of the sons of the Mongol kings and queens have been baptized and confess Christ. And they have established churches in their military camps, and they pay honour to the Christians, and  there are among them many who are believers."|Travels of Rabban Bar Sauma <ref>[http://www.aina.org/books/mokk/mokk.htm "The Monks of Kublai Khan Emperor of China", Sir E. A. Wallis Budge]</ref>}}

Upon his return, Bar Sauma wrote an elaborate account of his journey, which is of keen interest to modern historians, as it was the first account of Europe as seen through Eastern eyes.

==Influence of Catholic Christianity==
{{main|Christianity in Asia}}
The type of Christianity which the Mongols practiced was an Eastern or [[Nestorian Christianity|Nestorian]] form, which had split off from the Western doctrine in the 5th century due to the [[Nestorian Schism]].  Over the centuries, much of Europe had become unaware that there were any Christians in Asia, except for vague legends of a [[Prester John]], a Christian king from the East who many hoped would come to help with the [[Crusades]] and the fight for the Holy Land.  Even after contacts were re-established, there were still Western missionaries who proceeded eastward, to try and convert the Mongols to Roman Catholicism, away from what was regarded as [[heresy|heretical]] Nestorianism.  Some contacts were with the capital of the Mongols, first in [[Karakorum]] and then [[Khanbaliq]] (Beijing) in Mongol-conquered China. A larger number of contacts were with the closest of the Mongol states, the [[Ilkhanate]] in what today is Iran, Iraq, and Syria.

As early as 1223, Franciscan missionaries had been traveling eastward to visit the prince of Damascus and the Caliph of Baghdad.<ref name=roux-95>Roux, ''Les explorateurs'', pp. 95&ndash;97</ref> In 1240, nine [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] led by Guichard of Cremone are known to have arrived in [[Tiflis]], the capital of Christian Georgia, by the orders of [[Pope Gregory IX]]. Georgia submitted to the advancing Mongols in 1243, so as the missionaries lived for five years in the Georgian realm, much of it was in contact or in close proximity with the Mongols.<ref name=roux-95/> In 1245, [[Pope Innocent IV]] sent a series of four missions to the Mongols. The first was led by the Dominican [[Andr<U+00E9> de Longjumeau]], who had already been sent to Constantinople once by [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] to acquire the [[Crown of thorns]] from [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II]].<ref name=roux-95/> His travels are known by the reports of [[Matthew Paris]]. Three other missions were sent between March and April 1245, led respectively by the Dominican [[Ascelin of Cremone]] (accompanied by [[Simon de Saint-Quentin]], who later wrote the account of the mission in ''Historia Tartarorum''),<ref name=roux-95/> the Franciscan [[Lawrence of Portugal]], and another Franciscan, [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine|John of Plano Carpini]].

In 1253, the Franciscan [[William of Rubruck]] traveled to [[Karakorum]], the western Mongol capital, and sought permission to serve its people in the name of Christ. He was received courteously, but forbidden to engage in missionary work or remain in the country.{{ref|AFM}} At one point of his stay among the Mongols, William did enter into a famous competition at the Mongol court. The khan encouraged a formal debate between the Christians, Buddhists, and Muslims, to determine which faith was correct, as determined by three judges, one from each faith.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jack |last=Weatherford|title=Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World|page=173}}</ref> When William returned to the West, he wrote a 40-chapter document on the customs and geography of the Mongols.

Dominican missionaries to the Ilkhanate included [[Ricoldo of Montecroce]] and [[Barthelemy of Bologna]], who later became the bishop in the Ilkhanate capital of [[Maragha]].  By the year 1300, there were numerous Dominican and Franciscan convents in the Il-Khanate. About ten cities had such institutions, including Maragha, [[Tabriz]], [[Sultaniye]], [[Tifflis]], and [[Erzurum]]. To help with coordination, the Pope established an archbishop in the new capital of [[Sultaniye]] in 1318 in the person of Francon de P<U+00E9>rouse, who was assisted by six bishops. His successor in 1330 was Jean de Cor.<ref>Roux, <U+2018><U+2019>Histoire de l<U+2019>Empire Mongol<U+2019><U+2019>, p. 439</ref> 

In 1302, the Nestorian Catholicos [[Mar Yaballaha III]], who as a young man had accompanied the older Rabban Bar Sauma from [[Khanbaliq]] (Beijing), sent a profession of faith to the Pope. He thereby formalized his conversion to Roman Catholicism, though a 1304 letter from him to the pope indicated that his move had been strongly opposed by the local Nestorian clergy.<ref>Luisetto, p.99-100</ref> 

Mongol-European contacts diminished as Mongol power waned in Persia, and the Mongols progressively adopting [[Islam]].  In 1295, [[Ghazan]] (great-grandson of Hulagu) formally adopted Islam when he took the throne of the Ilkhanate in 1295, as did [[Berke]] along with other [[Golden Horde]] leaders.  

In his own letters to the Mongol ruler in 1321 and 1322, the Pope still expressed his hope that the Mongol ruler would convert to Christianity. Between 500 to 1000 converts in each city were numbered by Jean of Sultaniye.<ref>Roux, ''Histoire'', p. 440</ref>

By the 14th century, the Mongols had effectively disappeared as a political power.

===Catholic missions to Mongol China===
[[File:NoccoloAndMaffeoPoloWithGregoryX.JPG|thumb|left|Niccolo and Maffeo [[Marco Polo|Polo]] remitting a letter from [[Kublai Khan]] to [[Pope Gregory X]] in 1271]]
In 1271, the [[Marco Polo|Polo brothers]] brought an invitation from [[Kublai Khan]] to [[Pope Gregory X]], imploring him that a hundred teachers of science and religion be sent to reinforce the Christianity already present in his vast empire. This came to naught due to the hostility of influential Nestorians within the Mongol court, who objected to the introduction of the Western (Roman Catholic) form of Christianity to supplant their own Nestorian doctrine. 

In 1289, [[Pope Nicholas IV]] sent the Franciscan [[John of Monte Corvino]], who became China's first Roman Catholic missionary. He was significantly successful, translated the [[New testament]] and [[Psalms]] into the Mongol language, built a central church, and within a few years (by 1305) could report six thousand baptized converts. But the work was not easy. He was often opposed by the Nestorians, whose style of Eastern Christianity was different from John's Western version.  But the Franciscan mission continued to grow, other priests joined him and centers were established in the coastal provinces of [[Kiangsu]]  ([[Yangchow]]), [[Chekiang]] ([[Hangchow]]) and [[Fujian|Fukien]] ([[Zaitun]]). Following the death of Monte Corvino, an embassy to the French [[Pope Benedict XII]] in [[Avignon]] was sent by [[Toghun Tem<U+00FC>r]], the last Mongol emperor in the [[Yuan dynasty]] of China, in 1336.<ref>Jackson, p. 314</ref> The Mongol ruler requested a new spiritual guide to replace Monte Corvino, so in 1338, a total of 50 ecclesiastics were sent by the Pope to [[Peking]], among them [[John of Marignolli]].

Two massive catastrophes hastened the extinction of this second wave of missionaries to China. Firstly, the [[Black Death]] during the latter half of the fourteenth century in Europe so depleted Franciscan houses that they were unable to sustain the mission to China. Secondly, the Mongol-created [[Yuan Dynasty]] in China began to decline. The native Chinese rose up and drove out the Mongols, thereby launching the [[Ming Dynasty]] in 1368. By 1369, all Christians, whether Roman Catholic or Syro-Oriental, were expelled. With the end of Mongol rule in the 14th century, Christianity almost disappeared in mainland Asia, with three of the four principal Mongol khanates embracing Islam.<ref>The Encyclopedia Americana, By Grolier Incorporated, p. 680</ref>
