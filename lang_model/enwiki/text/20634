}}
'''Our Lady Star of the Sea and St Winefride, Amlwch''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] church in [[Amlwch]], a town on the island of [[Anglesey]], north Wales. It was built in the 1930s to a design by an Italian architect, Giuseppe Rinvolucri, using [[reinforced concrete]]. The church is in the shape of an upturned boat, reflecting Amlwch's maritime heritage, and is dedicated to [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]] (a title of [[St Mary]]) and [[Winefride|St Winefride]], a Welsh saint.

The church has been temporarily closed since 2004 because of structural problems. An appeal has been launched to raise over <U+00A3>1&nbsp;million for the necessary repairs; an application for <U+00A3>840,000 from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], however, was rejected in 2009. The church is a [[listed building|Grade II* listed building]], a designation given to "particularly important buildings of more than special interest",<ref name=Cadwlist>{{cite book|url=http://www.cadw.wales.gov.uk/upload/resourcepool/WhatIsListing_englishLR983.pdf|format=PDF|title=What is listing?|publisher=[[Cadw]]|year=2005|isbn=1857602226 |page=6}}</ref> because it is a "remarkable inter-war church", built to "a highly unusual and experimental design".<ref name=List>{{cite web|url=http://jura.rcahms.gov.uk/cadw/cadw_eng.php?id=24455|title=Church of Our Lady Star of the Sea, St Winifred <!-- wrong spelling on the Cadw list -->|author=[[Cadw]]|publisher=Historic Wales|year=2009|accessdate=22 June 2010}} (The church's name is spelt incorrectly on the Cadw document.)</ref> [[The Twentieth Century Society]] has called it "a rare and unique church",<ref name=TCS/> and it has also been called "one of Britain's most avant-garde churches".<ref name=Telegraph/>

==History and location==
The church is on the [[A5025 road]], about {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} to the west of Amlwch, a town on the north coast of [[Anglesey]], Wales.<ref name=Anglesey>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Geraint I. L. |year=2006|title=Anglesey Churches|publisher=Carreg Gwalch|isbn=1845270894|page=31}}</ref> It is dedicated to [[St Mary]] (under the title [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]]) and to [[Winefride|St Winefride]], a 7th-century Welsh noblewoman who is also venerated at [[St Winefride's Well]], [[Flintshire]]. Construction of the church began in 1932, when the foundations were excavated. It was completed in 1937, and the church was consecrated in the same year.<ref name=Anglesey/> The architect was Giuseppe Rinvolucri, an Italian engineer from [[Piedmont]], who settled in [[Conwy]], north Wales.  His specialist field was the design of [[Roman Catholic]] churches, and other examples of his work in Wales can be found in [[Abergele]] and [[Porthmadog]].<ref name=List/><ref name=Pev/>

The church is part of [[Caernarfon Deanery]] within the [[Diocese of Wrexham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrexhamdiocese.org.uk/ourstandard.asp?pageid=145|title=Wrexham Diocese: Deaneries|publisher=Diocese of Wrexham|accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref> The parish priest is Father Michael Ryan, of the [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate]]. The parish of Amlwch also includes the churches of St David, [[Cemaes Bay]], and Our Lady of Lourdes, [[Benllech]].<ref name=Wrex/>

Damage from the weather and deterioration in the concrete has meant that the church has been closed for worship since 2004, requiring worshippers to attend services elsewhere on Anglesey.<ref name=Mail/><ref name=OMI/><ref name=Jenkins/> Demolition was a possibility in 2006.<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2022075/Save-Our-Churches-lost-without-Our-Lady.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=Save Our Churches: lost without 'Our Lady' |last=Leach|first=Ben|date=24 May 2008|accessdate=25 June 2010}}</ref> An appeal has been launched to raise the estimated <U+00A3>1.2&nbsp;million to <U+00A3>1.4&nbsp;million necessary for repairs.<ref name=Telegraph/><ref name=Mail/> The planned work includes replacing the roof coverings, redecorating internally and externally, and repairing the steps.<ref name=Mail>{{cite news|url=http://www.theonlinemail.co.uk/bangor-and-anglesey-news/local-bangor-and-anglesey-news/2010/06/16/amlwch-church-gets-funding-boost-for-renovation-project-66580-26654346/|title=Amlwch church gets funding boost for renovation project|work=[[Bangor and Anglesey Mail]]|last=Hearn|first=Elgan|date=16 June 2010|accessdate=25 June 2010}}</ref> An application for planning permission for the work was submitted in May 2008 to the [[Isle of Anglesey County Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynysmon.gov.uk/upload/public/attachments/84/12MAY20081.pdf|title=List of Applications Received in the Week 12/5/08 <U+2013> 18/5/08|format=PDF|publisher=Isle of Anglesey County Council|accessdate=26 June 2010|page=4}}</ref> An application for a grant of <U+00A3>840,000 from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] was rejected on 18 March 2009, with the committee concerned about the proposed new extension (terming it "inappropriate"), although recognising the "high heritage merit" of the proposal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.hlf.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/D158817C-76DF-4918-9B8D-AC8CDA86C18C/7596/SummaryReportWalesMarch20091.pdf|format=PDF|title=Heritage Lottery Fund Committee for Wales Meeting on 18 March 2009|publisher=Heritage Lottery Fund|accessdate=26 June 2010|page=3}}</ref> [[Cadw]] (the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] body responsible for the built heritage of Wales) made a grant of <U+00A3>150,000 in 2007; the [[National Churches Trust]] made a grant of <U+00A3>10,000 in June 2010; and there have been donations from other bodies and individuals.<ref name=Mail/>

==Architecture and fittings==
Built of [[reinforced concrete]], the building is designed in the style of an upturned boat, and the design has a "nautical theme" with elements such as porthole windows.<ref name=List/><ref name=Anglesey/> This is a deliberate reference to Amlwch's history as a port town and its position on the coast.<ref name=Telegraph/><ref name=OMI>{{cite web|url=http://www.omianglesey.org/ourstandard.asp?pageid=80|title=Our Lady Star Of The Sea And St. Winefride RC Church|publisher=Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, Isle of Anglesey|accessdate=25 June 2010}}</ref> The church has "ribs" along the outside, with portholes on the base plinth between each rib.<ref name=List/>

The main entrance is at the south end of the church at the top of some stone steps on either side. A window shaped like a star and set in mosaic is positioned above the door, and there is a stone cross at the top of the facade. The concrete of the church is dressed with stone on the south side, nearest the main road. The ribs on the outside are visible inside the building, with patterns of lights and marble panels in between.<ref name=List/> The vestry is to the rear of the church, and there is a parish hall underneath it.<ref name=List/><ref name=Anglesey/>

==Assessment==
The church is a Grade II* [[listed building]] <U+2013> the second-highest (of three) grade of listing, designating "particularly important buildings of more than special interest".<ref name=Cadwlist/> It was given this status on 12 December 2000, and has been listed as "a remarkable inter-war church".<ref name=List/> Cadw describes it as "striking and individual", and "a highly unusual and experimental design which exploits the plastic qualities of its constructional material to create a powerfully expressive religious building."<ref name=List/>

A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey describes it as "a very impressive building", that "must surely be the most unusual church in Anglesey."<ref name=Anglesey/> A 2009 guide to the buildings of north Wales describes it as "a piece of Italian architectural daring".<ref name=Pev>{{cite book|title=The Buildings of Wales: Gwynedd|chapter=Anglesey: Amlwch|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300141696|year=2009|page=93|last=Haslam|first=Richard|last2=Orbach|first2=Julian|last3=Voelcker|first3=Adam}}</ref>  Referring to the French structural engineer [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Freyssinet]], who worked with concrete, the guide rhetorically asks, "What inspired this Futurist church, closer to Freyssinet's 1920s airship hangers at Orly, Paris, than to Catholic church design, and so unlike the conservatism of Anglesey building?"<ref name=Pev/> The heritage writer and journalist [[Simon Jenkins]] has said that the church is worth a visit for the exterior alone, even though it is closed. He noted the "sweeping parabolic arches, perhaps inspired by airship hangers or by upturned boats in Amlwch harbour", as well as the "bold gable with sloping sides" at the west end, concluding "This church must be saved."<ref name=Jenkins>{{cite book|title=Wales: Churches, Houses, Castles|year=2008|isbn=978-713998931|publisher=Penguin Books|page=48|last=Jenkins|first=Simon|authorlink=Simon Jenkins}}</ref> It has also been described as "one of Britain's most avant-garde churches".<ref name=Telegraph/>  [[The Twentieth Century Society]] has said that it is "by far [Rinvolucri's] best work", and that it is "very concerned for its future", calling it "a rare and unique church".<ref name=TCS>{{cite web|url=http://www.c20society.org.uk/casework/reports/2005/the-italian-touch.html|title=The Italian Touch|first=Eva |last=Branscome|publisher=[[The Twentieth Century Society]]|date=September 2005|accessdate=25 June 2010}}</ref> It noted the "highly individual interpretation of its seaside setting", with a "strikingly modern" parabolic design and a "monumental almost pyramidal aesthetic" at the entrance.<ref name=TCS/>
