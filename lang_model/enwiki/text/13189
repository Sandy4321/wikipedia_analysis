The '''Greater Ani''', ''Crotophaga major'', is a large [[near-passerine]] [[bird]] in the  [[cuckoo]] family. It is a breeding species from [[Panama]] and  [[Trinidad]] through tropical [[South America]] to northern [[Argentina]].  It is sometimes referred to as the black cuckoo.  

This [[ani (bird)|ani]] is found in [[mangrove]] swamps, semi-open woodland near water, and the edges of forests. It is a seasonal [[bird migration|smigrant]] in at least some parts of its range. The nest, built communally by several pairs,  is a deep cup lined with leaves and placed usually 2-5 m high in a tree. A number of  females lay their chalky deep blue eggs in the nest and then share incubation and feeding. Nests have been found containing 3-10 eggs.

The Greater Ani is about 48 cm long and weighs 170 g.  The adult is mainly blue-glossed black, with a long tail, massive ridged black bill, and a white iris. Immature birds have a dark iris.

This is a very gregarious species, always found in noisy groups. The calls include croaking and [[Turkey (bird)|turkey-like]] gobbling ''kro-koro''. The Greater Ani feeds on large [[insect]] and even [[lizard]]s and [[frog]]s.
