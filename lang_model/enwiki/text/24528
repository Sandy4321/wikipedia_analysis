'''Krzysztof "Kristof" Warzycha''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''<U+039A><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03CC><U+03C6> <U+0392><U+03B1><U+03B6><U+03AD><U+03C7><U+03B1>'') (born [[November 17]], [[1964]] in [[Swiebodzin]]) is a former Polish professional [[football (soccer)|footballer]] who has played for Greek club [[Panathinaikos FC]]. He is Panathinaikos' all-time leading goalscorer (the highest in the history of Greek football) and an idol for the club. He played 50 times for the Polish national team, scoring 9 goals. He played the last game for the Polish national team in April of 1997 against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in Napoli losing the game 3-0.

He joined Panathinaikos from [[Poland|Polish]] team [[KS Ruch Chorz<U+00F3>w]] in December of 1989, after winning the [[Polish Championship in Football|Polish Championship]] and being top scorer in the [[Orange Ekstraklasa|Polish premier league]]. 

In [[April 4]], [[1996]], Warzycha scored one his most crucial goal during his career (according to a late interview) against the powerful [[Ajax Amsterdam]] in [[Olympisch Stadion (Amsterdam)|Amsterdam Olympic Stadium]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RESiNeJRNw8] and gave Ajax their first home ground lose in 4 years. This memorable goal gave him significant reputation in European football.

At the end of the 2000/01 season, Warzycha had scored an incredible 235 goals in 352 matches and had been the Greek [[Alpha Ethniki]] premier league's top scorer in three different years in the 90s (1994, 1995 and 1998 seasons). His appearances in the [[UEFA Champions League]] have been no less impressive - he scored six goals in Panathinaikos' nine games on the way to the semi-finals of the 1995/96 competition. 
 
On the 29th of April, 2001 during the match with [[Ionikos]], Krzysztof Warzycha succeeded the 233rd goal of his career in Greece and reached [[Mimis Papaioannou]] at the second place of the scorers of all times. After two football periods Krzysztof succeeded the 234rd goal and remained alone at the second place of the scorers. Such have been Warzycha's achievements on the pitch and services to Greek football that he was granted Greek citizenship in 1998. He retired in 2004.

== Trivia == 
Warzycha's goalscoring ability made him famous all-over Europe during his career. Thats why, in 2001 the International Federation of Football History and Statistics ([[IFFHS]]) awarded him the Second Prize for the most active goalscorer.
