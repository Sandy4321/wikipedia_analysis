"'''The Time of the Doctor'''" is an episode of the British science fiction television programme ''[[Doctor Who]]'', written by [[Steven Moffat]] and directed by [[Jamie Payne]], and was broadcast on 25 December 2013 on BBC One.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p011kvk4/features/highlights |title=BBC One Christmas 2013 - Schedule Highlights |author=[[BBC One]] Christmas |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=15 December 2013 }}</ref> It features the final regular appearance of [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and the first regular appearance of [[Peter Capaldi]] as the [[Twelfth Doctor]] following his brief cameo in "[[The Day of the Doctor]]". The episode also features [[Jenna Coleman]] as the Doctor's companion [[Clara Oswald]], plus several enemies of the Doctor, including the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]], [[Silence (Doctor Who)|Silence]], [[Dalek]]s, and [[Weeping Angel]]s.

"The Time of the Doctor" is the third installment in a loose [[trilogy]] of episodes, following "[[The Name of the Doctor]]" and "[[The Day of the Doctor]]", which together serve as the Eleventh Doctor's [[swan song]]. The episode addresses numerous plot threads developed over the course of Smith's tenure, including the prophecy of the Silence and the Doctor's fate on the planet [[List of Doctor Who planets#T|Trenzalore]]. "The Time of the Doctor" is also the 800th individual episode of ''Doctor Who'', the ninth Christmas special since the show's 2005 revival, and Matt Smith's fourth and final Christmas special as the Eleventh Doctor.

==Plot==

The Doctor's [[TARDIS]] is among thousands of ships orbiting an unknown planet, from which a message that no-one can translate is being broadcast continually across time and space. With the assistance of a modified [[Cyberman]] head nicknamed "Handles," which he is using as a personal assistant, the Doctor briefly visits two of these ships, before leaving to Earth to pick up [[Clara Oswald|Clara]]. On returning, Handles identifies the planet as being [[Gallifrey]], the lost planet of the [[Time Lord]]s, a statement the Doctor vehemently rejects. The Doctor and Clara are invited on board the first ship to arrive at the scene <U+2014> the Church of the Papal Mainframe, a space church headed by Mother Superious Tasha Lem, an old acquaintance of the Doctor. Tasha states that the Chruch has secured the planet with a [[force field]] and that the message instills fear into all who have heard it, then asks if the Doctor wishes to be the first to explore the cause of the message. On arriving, they find a town called Christmas that is surrounded by a truth field that prevents anyone from telling a lie. The message's origin is quickly identified as a crack in reality in the church tower; this crack is "[[Scar|scar tissue]]" from the cracks originally closed when the Doctor rebooted the universe ("[[The Big Bang (Doctor Who)|The Big Bang]]"). Handles identifies the language of the message as Gallifreyan and with the Doctor's help, translates the message as a question: "Doctor ''who''?" (the 'first question' in "[[The Wedding of River Song]]"), repeating endlessly. It is a request that the Doctor should speak his real name and thereby confirm it is truly he who is there. 

The Doctor concludes that his people, the [[Time Lords]], are calling to him for help, from the [[pocket universe]] in which Gallifrey was trapped ("[[The Day of the Doctor]]"), from which they wish to escape. If the Doctor answers the question and speaks his real name, the Time Lords will know they have found the right place and come through to their home universe. However, this would also trigger a renewal of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] as the alien species gathered above descend to destroy them, and Tasha states this will not be allowed to happen: the planet will be destroyed first at whatever cost. The Doctor asks the name of the planet, and she states "Trenzalore", the planet where the Doctor knows he will one day die and have his tomb ("[[The Name of the Doctor]]"). The Doctor tricks Clara into plugging a device into the TARDIS which transports her home, and remains on Trenzalore to defend the planet from incursions by the aliens overhead, creating a [[stalemate]] where he cannot leave without sacrificing his home and its people, nor can he be removed for fear he will speak his name and let them return.

Immediately after landing Clara home, the TARDIS begins to return to Trenzalore, but Clara manages to hold on to the outside of the ship and join it on its return trip. However, to protect her from the [[time vortex (Doctor Who)|time vortex]], the TARDIS is forced to increase its shields, consequently slowing down the return journey. Arriving back at Christmas, Clara meets a visibly aged Doctor who has spent 300 years defending the town. He reveals to her that, although he is known as the Eleventh Doctor, he has already used all twelve of his allotted [[regeneration (Doctor Who)#Maximum number of regenerations in a cycle|regenerations]], once his incarnation who fought in the Time War ([[War Doctor]]) and the Tenth Doctor's aborted regeneration ("[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]") are counted. He is therefore in his final body and can no longer regenerate, and is instead visibly aging. He and Clara are then brought to the Papal Mainframe&mdash;now [[Silence (Doctor Who)|the Church of the Silence]]. Here, he learns that during this protracted [[stalemate]], a chapter of the Church broke away (see [[Madame Kovarian]]) and tried to avert these events by killing off the Doctor in the past: by destroying his TARDIS ("[[The Big Bang (Doctor Who)|The Big Bang]]") and engineering a child to kill him ("[[A Good Man Goes to War]]"). It is revealed that Tasha and her crew have been taken over by Dalek consciousnesses, converting them into [[Asylum of the Daleks|Dalek puppets]], causing the Daleks also to regain their memories of the Doctor (lost since "Asylum of the Daleks"). The Doctor taunts Tasha, awakening her anger, and allowing her to resist the Dalek consciousness within her. They all escape the ship and return to the planet.

Despite promising never to send Clara away again, the Doctor does so and she returns to Earth as the siege of Trenzalore becomes an all out war. As the years go by, most of the races depart or are destroyed, leaving only the Silence (with whom the Doctor puts aside his differences and allies himself) and the Daleks. Later the same day (from Clara's perspective), the TARDIS reappears; Clara enters to find Tasha piloting the TARDIS. Noting that "flying the TARDIS is easy, it's flying the Doctor that's hard", Tasha returns Clara to Trenzalore, as "no one should die alone", sending her to meet with the aged and slightly senile Doctor. With nothing left and telling Clara that changing the future is impossible without the Time Lords, the Doctor goes out to meet the Daleks in a final stand. 

[[File:Peter Capaldi piloting tardis.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi) attempts to pilot the TARDIS for the first time.]]As Clara cannot bear to watch what will follow, she returns to the time crack and through it, begs the Time Lords to save the Doctor, noting that it is owed to him for all he has done. The Doctor is preparing to die outside, when the time crack vanishes from Clara's sight in the tower, to appear across the night sky. [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|Regeneration]] energy flows from the crack and into the Doctor: the Time Lords have granted the Doctor a complete new regeneration cycle, thereby saving him from death and changing his future. 

As his thirteenth regeneration starts, the Doctor uses the excess energy to destroy the Daleks facing him. In the aftermath, Clara finds the Doctor, young again, back in the TARDIS. He states that this temporary rejuvenation is a 'reset' for the new cycle of regenerations to begin and the second phase of the regeneration is taking some time to start up, but he will soon change. He delivers a eulogy to his current form, and hallucinates a final farewell to [[Amy Pond]], the first person he met after [[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|his last regeneration]]. He then removes his [[bow tie]], a defining feature of his eleventh incarnation, before regenerating into [[Twelfth Doctor|The Twelfth Doctor]]. After commenting on his new kidneys and his dislike of their colour, the new Doctor worriedly asks a shocked Clara if she knows how to fly the TARDIS.

===Continuity===
{{references|date=December 2013}}
As the Eleventh Doctor's final appearance,  numerous plot threads developed over the course of his journey are addressed: 

<U+2022> Remnants of the [[Story arcs in Doctor_Who#Cracks in the universe|Cracks in the universe]], the major story arc of the fifth series, are being used by the Time Lords in an attempt to break back into the universe after their [[The Day of the Doctor|rescue from the Time War]].

<U+2022> The intention of the [[Silence (Doctor Who)|Silence]] and the rationale behind the prophecy ([[The Wedding of River Song| "Silence will fall when the question is asked"]]) are revealed. This is to prevent the Time Lords from returning to the Universe and causing the [[Time war(Doctor Who)|time war]] to begin anew.

<U+2022> The Silence (or, as the episode reveals, a splinter faction of them) are finally confirmed to be behind the [[The Pandorica Opens|destruction of the TARDIS]]. Ironically, the explosion of the TARDIS is what caused the Cracks in the universe in the first place, a development which the Doctor notes is an [[Bootstrap paradox|ontological paradox]]. The Silence' attempt to kill the Doctor with [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] is also referenced.

<U+2022> The Eleventh Doctor's regeneration-based hallucinations of young and adult Amelia/Amy Pond are similar to that of the [[Fourth Doctor|Fourth]] and [[Fifth Doctor]]s seeing images of their companions before regenerating, and the [[Tenth Doctor]] who visited [[Rose Tyler|Rose]], the first face that incarnation saw, before regenerating (along with his subsequent companions [[Mickey Smith]], [[Martha Jones]], [[Sarah Jane Smith]], [[Jack Harkness]], [[Donna Noble]] and [[Wilfred Mott]]. 

<U+2022> The Doctor mentions that the Gallifreyan seal in his possession was taken from [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] in the Death Zone - a direct reference to ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' where the [[Third Doctor]] was given the seal as evidence of the Master's benign intentions. The Time Lords granting the Doctor a new cycle of regenerations also harkens back to the Master in ''The Five Doctors'' in which a new cycle of regenerations was offered as a reward for his service.

<U+2022> Clara mentions being an English teacher, having been shown at Coal Hill School in "[[The Day of the Doctor]]". 

<U+2022> The TARDIS moved at a slow pace when protecting the mortal Clara outside of its doors in the time vortex. In contrast, it was not slowed when the immortal Jack Harkness clung to ship in "[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]", and French posters that had been stuck to the TARDIS in "[[Vincent and the Doctor]]" were shown to have been incinerated by their journey through the vortex. 

<U+2022> "The Papal Mainframe herself" was referred to by Colonel Manton in "[[A Good Man Goes to War]]". 

<U+2022> Clara's father has remarried; Clara's mother was shown in "[[The Rings of Akhaten]]" to have perished in 2005 during the events of "[[Rose (Doctor Who)|Rose]]".  

<U+2022> The Time Lords' message through the crack is said to have been transmitted across time and space, luring the Doctor and all of his / the Time Lords' enemies <U+2014> just as had been the case with the Pandorica's signal in "[[The Pandorica Opens]]".  

<U+2022> The episode ends with the Twelfth Doctor having apparently lost his ability to pilot the TARDIS (although he is seen ably [[The Day of the Doctor|flying her at a later point in his life]]. However, temporary confusion, exhaustion and severe mental incapacity are symptomatic of regeneration sickness as particularly depicted in ''[[Spearhead From Space]]'', ''[[Robot (Doctor Who)|Robot]]'', ''[[Castrovalva (Doctor Who)|Castrovalva]]'', ''[[The Twin Dilemma]]'', ''[[Time and the Rani]]'', the [[Doctor Who (film)|1996 telefilm]], and "[[The Christmas Invasion]]".

Matt Smith said filming would commence on the episode when he had finished work on the film ''[[How to Catch a Monster]]''. He later revealed filming would start in September.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://doctorwhotv.co.uk/smith-on-his-final-hour-hurt-revelations-12th-doctor-51723.htm|title=Smith on his "Final Hour", Hurt Revelations, 12th Doctor|publisher=Doctor Who TV|date=19 July 2013|accessdate=21 July 2013}}</ref> The episode was directed by Jamie Payne, who previously directed the episode "[[Hide (Doctor Who)|Hide]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/doctor-who/26049/doctor-who-christmas-special-director-announced |title=Doctor Who: Christmas Special director announced |publisher=Den of Geek |date=18 June 2013 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> The [[read-through]] from the Christmas special took place on 4 September 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/articles/Christmas-Special-Read-Through|title=Christmas Special Read Through|publisher=BBC|date=4 September 2013|accessdate=5 September 2013}}</ref>

In August 2013, Moffat stated in an interview that the Christmas episode would tie together the remaining story strands from the Eleventh Doctor era, some of which were introduced as far back as "[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/moffat-will-tie-up-11th-doctor-loose-ends-52618.htm |title=Moffat Will Tie Up 11th Doctor Loose Ends |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=22 August 2013 |website=Doctor Who TV |publisher= |accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref> Production on the episode was scheduled to start on 8 September. Owing to his work on the film ''[[How to Catch a Monster]]'', which required him to have a [[buzz cut]], Matt Smith had to wear a wig to mimic the Doctor's hairstyle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2013/09/smith-filming-040913090008.html|title=Matt Smith to start shooting Christmas Special from Sunday|publisher=Doctor Who News|date=4 September 2013|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> In August 2013, it was revealed that the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] would feature in the Christmas episode, when one of the show's regular stunt artists,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dazparker.co.uk/showreel/ |title=Daz Parker - Showreel |last=Parker |first=Darrelle "Daz" |publisher=Suunto |accessdate=29 November 2013 }}</ref> Darrelle "Daz" Parker, tweeted that she would be playing a Cyberman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/cybermen-christmas-2013-tweet.jpg |title=Great to be stunting again for Dr Who in the Christmas special playing a Cyberman! |last=Parker |first=Darrelle "Daz" |work=[[Twitter]] |publisher=Doctor Who TV |date=28 August 2013|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref> This was the second time that the Cybermen have appeared in a regeneration story, following ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'' in 1966,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/357617 |title=Cybermen set for Matt Smith/Peter Capaldi <U+2018>Doctor Who<U+2019> special |last1= Wace Peck|first1=Matthew |last2= |first2= |date=3 September 2013 |website=Digital Journal |publisher= |accessdate=9 September 2013}}</ref> and the second time the Cybermen have appeared in a Christmas special, after "[[The Next Doctor]]" in 2008.

On 23 November 2013, the teaser trailer released on BBC One after "[[The Day of the Doctor]]" revealed that the [[Daleks]], [[Weeping Angels]], and the [[Silence (Doctor Who)|Silence]] would also be appearing in the episode. Although the Daleks and the Cybermen had previously met in "[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]" and "[[The Pandorica Opens]]", this marks the first time that the four species have appeared in an episode together. Revealed in the trailer is the Doctor's return to Trenzalore and the tagline "Silence Will Fall", which has been repeated through Matt Smith's run as the Doctor.

=== Recasting the Doctor ===

On 1 June, the BBC announced that Smith would be departing the series after almost four years, with the Christmas special episode being the episode of transition between Smith's Doctor and the next regeneration. The announcement sparked media and fan speculation as to whom the next Doctor might be.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/doctor-who-season-8-matt-smith-christmas-twelth |title=<U+2018>Doctor Who<U+2019>: Matt Smith Out; New Doctor Revealed in 2013 Christmas Special |publisher=Screenrant.com |date= |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> It was announced on 4 August 2013, during a special broadcast <U+2013> ''Doctor Who Live: The Next Doctor'' <U+2013> that the twelfth incarnation of the Doctor is to be played by [[Peter Capaldi]].<ref name=12thDoc>{{cite web|title=Twitter / bbcdoctorwho: BREAKING NEWS!

==Broadcast and reception==
"The Time of the Doctor" was broadcast in the United Kingdom on [[BBC One]] on Christmas Day 2013 when it received initial overnight ratings of 8.3 million viewers (30.7% share) against the long running soap opera [[Coronation Street]] which got 7.9million viewers (though this was later bumped to 8.27million after the later repeat showing on [[ITV+1]] was factored in.) [[Doctor Who]] was the second most watched programme of the entire day across all channels, with the final 5 minutes (the regeneration from Smith to Capaldi) receiving the largest peak viewers of the day with 10.2million.<ref>{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Jones|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-12-03/doctor-who-christmas-special-air-date-and-time-confirmed|title=Doctor Who Christmas special air date and time confirmed|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=3 December 2013|accessdate=8 December 2013}}</ref> It was also shown on 25 December in the United States on [[BBC America]],<ref>{{cite web|first=Morgan|last=Jeffery|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a535727/doctor-who-matt-smith-christmas-exit-gets-us-air-date-on-bbc-america.html|title=Doctor Who: Matt Smith Christmas Exit gets US air-date on BBC America|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=4 December 2013|accessdate=8 December 2013}}</ref> in Canada on [[Space (TV channel)|Space]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.ca/article/time-of-the-doctor-new-pics|title=New pics revealed from the Doctor Who Christmas Special|publisher=[[Space (TV channel)|Space]]|date=5 December 2013|accessdate=8 December 2013}}</ref> in Germany on Fox and in Israel on [[yes Action]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152283032404239&set=a.283161979238.142775.258163944238&type=1|title=yes on Facebook|date=10 December 2013|language=he|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref> In Australia it aired on 26 December on [[ABC1]],<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/12/airdate-doctor-who-the-time-of-the-doctor.html|title=Airdate: Doctor Who: The Time of the Doctor|publisher=[[TV Tonight]]|date=6 December 2013|accessdate=8 December 2013}}</ref> and in New Zealand, it screened on [[Prime Television]] during Boxing Day evening.

"The Time of the Doctor" received generally mixed to positive reviews, with praise going towards Smith and Coleman's performances and the final scene, though criticism was directed towards the pacing and complexity of the episode. Many critics noticed similarities between the episode and the previous regeneration story: ''[[The End of Time]]''. Tim Martin of ''The Telegraph'' gave the episode three stars criticizing the complexity of the episode, " I would be fascinated to see what on Earth a newer entrant would make of its wild swings between geek-squad intensity and the heartstrings-and-comedy more usual for these Christmas episodes." He also criticized the fact that loose plot holes were all left to be answered in just 60 minutes, "Every time the Gordian plot-knot gets sonic-screwdrivered into submission for the 60-minute limit, the writers just tap the remnants into Later. What<U+2019>s the deal with the creepy brain-wiping creatures known as The Silence? Later. The name of the Doctor? Later, and then we get ''The Time of the Doctor'', where every second line seems to offer a footnote to some arcane Wikipedia entry on Whovian lore." But he praised Smith's final performance saying, "the actor was so good as the childlike alien."<ref name="telegraph review">{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10536070/Doctor-Who-The-Time-of-the-Doctor-BBC-One-review.html |title=Doctor Who, The Time of the Doctor, BBC One, review |last=Martin |first=Tim |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' |date=25 December 2013 |accessdate=26 December 2013 }}</ref>

''The Independent'' gave a positive review saying that, "Smith gave a cracking final performance before bowing out." They also said that the episode " was a sci-fi spectacular!" But they too criticized the plot as being too complicated for its own good.<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/doctor-who-christmas-special-tv-review-confused-by-the-new-doctorhe-certainly-seemed-to-be-9025336.html</ref>

Marcus Balmer of ''Cherwell'' gave the episode an overwhelmingly negative review, giving it just 2 stars out of 5. He called it "a deeply unsatisfying conclusion to Matt Smith's time in the blue box." He called the plot an "utter mess," and "drearily executed." He criticized the lack of story for Coleman saying, "she is given little else to do than run around and cry." He felt the episode was neither a Christmas romp, nor a satisfying conclusion for Smith, "merely occupying a boring liminal space between the two."<ref>http://www.cherwell.org/culture/film/2013/12/26/review-doctor-who-christmas-special-2013</ref>

Morgan Jeffrey of ''Digital Spy'' gave a positive review and gave the episode 4 stars out of 5 and said "Matt Smith steals the show, his final turn on Doctor Who is one of his very finest, perhaps even his absolute best." He also compared it to [[David Tennant]]'s final episode and said "Smith's regeneration scene too is a thing of beauty, like David Tennant before him, Smith gets to break the fourth wall, just a little, in his extended final monologue, it's perfect." He also was positive towards Clara and felt that she was now being written in a more human, empathetic way now that "the impossible girls arc is over", "even if it was a bit rushed" and felt that "steps were being taken in the right direction" with the character. He praised Jenna Coleman's performance, "she is dependably excellent." But he did say "'The Time of the Doctor' is a case of the parts being greater than the whole. It has great scenes and standout moments rather than being a great episode." He did also criticize the pacing and felt that "a repetitive story structure robbing many key moments of their power."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a540266/doctor-who-matt-smiths-final-episode-digital-spy-review.html |title=Doctor Who: Matt Smith's final episode |last=Jeffery |first=Morgan |publisher=''[[Digital Spy]]'' |date=26 December 2013 |accessdate=26 December 2013 }}</ref> 

''Io9'' found similarities between the episode and ''The End of Time'', with The Doctor seeing the person he first saw in his current incarnation before regenerating and "both are weighed under by the ominous, threatening shadow of their previous legacies, and in ways, both falter because of it." However they felt the "plot itself doesn't really quite hold up to the rest of the storytelling" They criticized Moffat for doing another "carnival of monsters, but this time, never feels quite justified, outside of a 'wouldn't it be cool *if*' moment." They also felt that it would best be suited to a two-parter like ''The End of Time'', "with that extra time to breathe, it might not have felt so rushed, and Moffat might have had the chance to explain things a little deeper." But they too praised Smith saying, "Smith shines in his final outing as The Doctor. It's a whizz through his greatest hits if you will, from humour to grandiose speechery, to his magical capacity to make your lip quiver with a glance of his eyes." Overall they called it "a fitting end to the Matt Smith era."<ref>http://observationdeck.io9.com/twelfth-night-the-time-of-the-doctor-spoilers-and-dis-1483886046</ref>

However Jon Cooper of ''The Mirror'' gave the episode a positive review, calling it "Easily the highlight of Christmas telly," and that it "gave Matt Smith a perfect send off." They awarded the episode 4 stars out of 5. He too praised Smith saying, "Easily the best he<U+2019>s put in since his tenure began."The thing he criticized was the pacing saying, "viewers hoping for an all-out intergalactic bloodbath must<U+2019>ve left feeling disappointed, hundreds of years of inter-species warfare were skipped over in the blink of an eye," He too found the need for every single one of the Doctors enemies to be there pointless, "Daleks on their own would have more than sufficed." He also found similarities with ''The End of Time'', mainly the regeneration sequence, with the Doctor removing one piece of his costume before changing, and the now traditional callback to the previous regeneration with Capaldi's entrance with the Kidneys line.<ref>http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-reviews/doctor-who-verdict-matt-smith-2959430</ref>
''Metro'' however were unimpressed by the episode and called it "unsatisfying" They also "don<U+2019>t think the 2005 Christmas Invasion has been bettered. Rose and her family were fully realised. It mixed the domestic with the sci fi" but felt that Clara's family were uninspired. They did feel that Capaldi's entrance was a highlight.<ref>http://metro.co.uk/2013/12/26/doctor-who-big-questions-answered-in-the-christmas-special-but-it-was-still-unsatisfying-4242604/</ref>

Marama Whyte of ''Hypable'' felt that the episode was "not all that is was cracked up to be," she felt the inclusion of every one of the doctors enemies to be "redundant and irrelevant to the plot." She criticized Moffat for being self indulgent for including monsters like the Weeping Angels, "a casual viewer might consider that this episode was more about a showrunner proving his own creativity than celebrating an actor," and for the writing being "lazy". She criticized the inclusion of Amy Pond when Clara was standing there as it simply "ignored the woman who was apparently so special to him, who had just saved his life!?"<ref>http://www.hypable.com/2013/12/26/doctor-who-christmas-special-matt-smith-farewell/</ref>
Brandi Belhagen of ''Hypable'' also felt that Amy should not have been included as she too felt that Clara was "overlooked and ignored".<ref>http://www.hypable.com/2013/12/26/doctor-who-christmas-special-karen-gillan/</ref>

Alasdair Wilkins of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' was overwhelmingly positive in his review, praising the subtle emotional complexities. "This episode belongs to Matt Smith, and it<U+2019>s entirely likely that this will go down as his finest work in the role. Steven Moffat takes great care to spotlight every aspect of Smith<U+2019>s Doctor. He is alternately grumpy, funny, awkward, flirty, inquisitive, giddy, and heartbroken, and that simply covers the bits up to the reveal of the crack in reality. The old-age makeup isn<U+2019>t entirely convincing<U+2014>though I<U+2019>m not honestly sure any old-age makeup has ever been entirely convincing<U+2014>but Smith nicely modulates his performance to suits the increasingly wizened versions of his Doctor."<ref name="AV Club"/> He also praised the episode for being an effective "final act" rather than a standalone story. He gave the episode a rating of "A".<ref name="AV Club">{{cite web|first=Alasdair|last=Wilkins|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/the-time-of-the-doctor-106556|title=The Time of the Doctor|work=[[The A.V.

''Radio Times'' said they were "really warming to the current companion, especially now she<U+2019>s free of the <U+201C>Impossible Girl<U+201D> baggage. Perky, resourceful, best-friend material, Jenna Coleman<U+2019>s Clara has a tangible echo of Lis Sladen<U+2019>s Sarah about her." They noticed an ''End of Time'' call back, with The Doctor seeing his previous companions before his regeneration and how the [[Tenth Doctor]] destroyed the TARDIS with regeneration energy, the Eleventh doctor destroyed a Dalek ship with it. They look forward to seeing Peter Capaldi take over with his "Gaunt, lizard-like [face] and with frou-frou hair." "In Peter Capaldi, we have a dream-wish Doctor."<ref>http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-12-25/doctor-who-the-time-of-the-doctor-review</ref>
