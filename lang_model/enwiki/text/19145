'''''Frank's Cock''''' is a 1993 Canadian [[short film]] written and directed by [[Mike Hoolboom]]. The eight-minute production stars [[Callum Keith Rennie]] as an unnamed narrator who discusses his relationship with his partner, Frank. The two met while the narrator was a teenager and spent nearly ten years together. Frank has since been diagnosed with [[AIDS]], and the narrator fears his death. The story was based on the experience of one of Hoolboom's friends at [[People With AIDS]], which Hoolboom adapted after receiving a commission to create a short film about [[breakup|breaking up]].

Shot on a low budget, the work is shown in a split-screen format with interspersed scenes from popular culture, [[gay pornography]], and [[Human embryogenesis|human embryo formation]]; this format is meant to symbolise the "fragmentation of the body" experienced by AIDS sufferers.{{sfn|Bunbury 1994, Hollywood and Other Canadas}} Produced by Alex Mackenzie, ''Frank's Cock'' was critically acclaimed and won several awards, including the NFB<U+2013>John Spotton Award for best Canadian short film at the [[1994 Toronto International Film Festival]]. The script has been republished several times and has inspired a short on [[LGBT]] issues in Canada's [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|native community]].

==Synopsis==

An unnamed narrator ([[Callum Keith Rennie]]), who as a teenager intended to be the "[[Michael Jordan]] of sex" or "[[Wayne Gretzky]] with a hard-on",{{sfn|Hoolboom 1997, Three Scripts}} discusses how he met and fell in love with an older man named Frank. After the two met at a [[group sex]] session, they began an older brother<U+2013>younger brother fantasy and moved in together. Frank has a voracious sexual appetite and, at times, invites the narrator for whole-day sex sessions. He is a tender lover, teaching his partner how to fly a [[box kite]] and cooking [[omelette]]s for him. The narrator is pleased with Frank's attentions and their sexual experimentation, although he is initially confused by Frank's insistence on listening to [[Peter Gzowski]]'s ''[[Morningside (radio program)|Morningside]]'' during sex. As their ten-year anniversary approaches, Frank&nbsp;<U+2013> having lost much weight and developed [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]s&nbsp;<U+2013> has been diagnosed with [[AIDS]], leaving the narrator stunned; he concludes the narration with "I'm going to miss him.  He was the best friend I ever had."{{sfn|Hoolboom 1997, Three Scripts}}

==Production==

The Canadian director [[Mike Hoolboom]] was diagnosed with [[HIV]] in 1988 or 1989,<!--he forgets when--> after going to donate blood. In a 1993 interview, he stated that he felt himself working harder after the diagnosis, finishing films at a more rapid rate because he was uncertain how long he would live. Hoolboom also became "fascinated with a body of parts spliced and spliced again", experimenting with "interruptive rhythms" as a way to reexamine simple acts.<ref>{{harvnb|de Bruyn 1993, What He Said}}; {{harvnb|Waugh|2006|p=316}}</ref> Having previously focused on films about the body, Hoolboom began dealing heavily with fragmentation, HIV/AIDS, and situations faced by those with the virus; ''Frank's Cock'' was his first venture directly addressing the AIDS issue.<ref>{{harvnb|McIntosh, Mike Hoolboom}}; {{harvnb|Lacey 1998, Portrait of the Filmmaker}}; {{harvnb|Waugh|2006|p=315}}</ref>

[[File:Mike Hoolboom.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A man looking to the left while holding a glass of beer|[[Mike Hoolboom]], creator of ''Frank's Cock'']]

While living in [[Vancouver]], Hoolboom joined the local [[People With AIDS]] (PWA) group.{{sfn|Hoolboom, Frank's Cock}} There he befriended a man (Joey in some sources, Alan in others) whose partner was dying of AIDS. Upon his friend's suggestion, Hoolboom began work on a script for "a real movie": one which portrayed an AIDS patient as full of love, not one that showed the patient's friends abandoning him. The friend was, however, unwilling to appear in the film.<ref>{{harvnb|Bunbury 1994, Hollywood and Other Canadas}}; {{harvnb|Hoolboom, Frank's Cock}}</ref> In writing the script Hoolboom tried to keep elements of humour; he later said that the humour was necessary as the source had insisted "most of our relationship was incredibly joyous and happy and a good time".{{sfn|Bunbury 1994, Hollywood and Other Canadas}}

After receiving a commission to make a short film for the Vancouver-based cooperative Cineworks, Hoolboom began working on realising the script with a low budget and limited amount of [[16&nbsp;mm film]] from the [[National Film Board of Canada]]; he was one of seven artists commissioned to "spark local production" with short films on [[breakup]], which were ultimately included in the omnibus ''Breaking Up''.<ref>{{harvnb|Bunbury 1994, Hollywood and Other Canadas}}; {{harvnb|Cineworks, Breaking Up}}</ref> Rennie&nbsp;<U+2013> at that time a relative unknown&nbsp;<U+2013> agreed to deliver the monologue. Hoolboom was pleased with the results, writing that Rennie presented the monologue as if "he'd been living this story all along."<ref>{{harvnb|Hoolboom, Frank's Cock}}; {{harvnb|Cole 2003/2004, From Frank's Cock}}</ref> The majority of the technical work, including direction, cinematography, and editing, was handled by Hoolboom; Alex Mackenzie, working for Cineworks, produced the film.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoolboom, Credits}}; {{harvnb|Cineworks, Omnibus}}</ref>

Part of the terms of his grant were that Hoolboom was allowed a limited number of [[Film editing|edit]]s (one{{sfn|Bunbury 1994, Hollywood and Other Canadas}} or three{{sfn|Cineworks, Breaking Up}}). After pondering how to complete the film under such terms, Hoolboom chose to use no edits. He recorded previously edited footage, some appropriated from various sources, through a hole in a piece of cardboard, producing a single quadrant; he repeated this process three times, using the same film, which resulted in four quadrants with four different images.{{sfn|Bunbury 1994, Hollywood and Other Canadas}} Production was completed by early 1993,{{sfn|de Bruyn 1993, What He Said}} and in screenings ''Frank's Cock'' was marketed as an "extremely explicit" [[experimental film]].{{sfn|Waugh|2006|p=316}}

Although societal awareness of AIDS had developed at a slower pace in Canada than in the United States, films regarding the disease had appeared nearly concurrently: both the first Canadian documentary and the first American feature-length film on the subject, [[Nik Sheehan]]'s ''No Sad Songs'' and [[John Erman]]'s ''[[An Early Frost]]'' respectively, were released in 1985.<ref>{{harvnb|Waugh|2006|p=280}}; {{harvnb|Hartl 2012, How Hollywood portrays AIDS}}</ref> However, the majority of the early gay artists with AIDS had died by the time Hoolboom made ''Frank's Cock''; as such, the film scholar Thomas Waugh considers Hoolboom a second-generation figurehead in AIDS activism and one of the earliest not coming from the gay community.{{sfn|Waugh|2006|p=316}}

==Style==

[[File:Frank's Cock Screenshot.jpg|thumb|alt=A screenshot from ''Frank's Cock''|A scene from the film, depicting the use of each quadrant; the split screen effect has been described as evoking the physical effects of AIDS.]]

''Frank's Cock'' divides the screen into quadrants, with the majority of the film focusing on the upper-right corner of the screen. In this panel, Rennie's character gives a monologue, which is sometimes illustrated by images in other panels: the lower-right panel flashes scenes of hardcore [[gay pornography]], the upper-left shows scenes representing [[Human embryogenesis|human embryo formation]], while the lower-left flashes excerpts from popular art.{{sfn|Cole 2003/2004, From Frank's Cock}} Aside from the original footage of Rennie, the short appropriated clips from the ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' episode "[[The Miracle of Life]]", the gay pornographic film ''The Best of Blondes'', and the [[music video]] for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 1992 song "[[Erotica (song)|Erotica]]".<ref>{{harvnb|TIFF, Frank's Cock}}; {{harvnb|Viper|1995|p=35}}</ref> The effect was later reused in Hoolboom's 1997 short ''Positiv''.{{sfn|Varga|2001|p=87}}

Janis Cole, writing for ''POV'' magazine, described the split-screen effect as supporting the text while "creating an optical treatment purposefully grounded in both dream and reality", as elements show out of sync.{{sfn|Cole 2003/2004, From Frank's Cock}} Jeff Rush and Cynthia Baughman, writing in the ''[[Journal of Film and Video]]'', described the film as showing that "text can reverse the traditional balance of words&nbsp;= abstractions/images&nbsp;= the concrete" through the creation of vivid, perhaps disturbing, word pictures which serve as tangible images contrasted with the faint abstractions which are the actual images.{{sfn|Rush & Baughman 1997, Introduction}} Jack Rusholme, prefacing a retrospective of Hoolboom's works by Experimenta Media Arts, wrote that the split-screen evokes the effects of AIDS, in which "the body [is] broken into dispersed vantages", while the narration serves to "bind with words what this disease will render lifeless and inert".{{sfn|Rusholme 1994, How to Die}} In a 1994 interview, Hoolboom stated that his intent was to represent the "fragmentation of the body" experienced by AIDS sufferers.{{sfn|Bunbury 1994, Hollywood and Other Canadas}}

==Reception==

''Frank's Cock'' has received warm critical reviews, both in Canada and abroad. Cole called it an "extraordinary experimental documentary" that is "as bold as the title implies" and a strong argument for the widespread dissemination of short films.{{sfn|Cole 2003/2004, From Frank's Cock}} Waugh placed ''Frank's Cock'' as one of a "great AIDS triptych", together with Hoolboom's later works ''[[Letters from Home (film)|Letters from Home]]'' (1996) and ''Positiv''.{{sfn|Waugh|2002|p=417}} The Canadian film scholar Darell Varga wrote that the film is an "emotionally riveting" eulogy to the loss of love.{{sfn|Varga|2001|p=86}} Karen Tisch, writing in ''Take One'', found that the short built its emotional power "delicately but steadily"; she suggested that its [[Toronto International Film Festival]] (TIFF) win was well-deserved.{{sfn|Tisch|1995|p=47}}

Reviewing for the [[Western Australia]]n independent film magazine ''In the Picture'', James Twentyman wrote that the film was "relatively straightforward" but strong and provocative, emphasising the "soul-baring" nature of the monologue.{{sfn|Twentyman|1994|p=18}} Rush and Baughman found that the short took the narrative voice beyond what is mainstream, demonstrating "the power of word and image",{{sfn|Rush & Baughman 1997, Introduction}} while Rusholme described ''Frank's Cock'' as Hoolboom's "most explicit AIDS narrative".{{sfn|Rusholme 1994, How to Die}} The Swiss film festival Viper touted the short as expressing humour and [[sexual obsession]] in the face of a plague.{{sfn|Viper|1995|p=35}}

Hoolboom has stated that he felt the film was accessible to both gay or straight audiences, which should "open them up to differences of form and why [one] would make something formally different."{{sfn|Bunbury 1994, Hollywood and Other Canadas}} Waugh suggested that this was successful, as in his experience audiences often cried at screenings.{{sfn|Waugh|2002|p=417}}

==Legacy==

''Frank's Cock'' won several awards at domestic and international film festivals. At the [[1994 Toronto International Film Festival|1994 TIFF]] it won the NFB<U+2013>John Spotton Award, given for the best Canadian short film. The jury cited ''Frank's Cock'' for its "evocative images,&nbsp;... impeccable writing and mise en scene,&nbsp;... moving depiction of the universal human experiences of love and loss in the age of AIDS, and especially for its success in shaking our preconceptions".{{sfn|Harris 1994, Festival Prize}} The selection included [[Canadian dollar|C$]]2,500 in prize money and a further C$2,500 worth of [[film processing]]. When accepting the award, Hoolboom quipped "''Frank's Cock'' has never seemed so large";{{sfn|Everett-Green 1995, A Pauper Prince}} Waugh, however, suggests that the title "caused more embarrassment than mirth" when it was read during the citation.{{sfn|Waugh|2006|p=331}} Special citations were also read for Andrew Munger's ''Make Some Noise'' and [[Philip Hoffman (filmmaker)|Philip Hoffman]]'s ''Technilogic Ordering''.{{sfn|Harris 1994, Festival Prize}}

That year the film won a Golden Leopard at the [[Locarno International Film Festival]] in [[Locarno]], Switzerland.{{sfn|TIFF, Frank's Cock}} At the [[Ann Arbor Film Festival]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], ''Frank's Cock'' won Best Dramatic Film.{{sfn|AAFF, Frank's Cock}} The Canadian Filmmakers' Distribution Centre, which has distribution rights for the film, notes further awards at the Interfilm Festival in [[Berlin]] and Second Prize Experimental at the [[College of Mass Communication & Media Arts#Big Muddy Film Festival|Big Muddy Film Festival]] in [[Carbondale, Illinois]] (both 1995),{{sfn|CFMDC, Frank's Cock}} while Hoolboom records ''Frank's Cock'' as receiving an honourable mention at the [[University of Oregon]]'s Queer Film Fest (1994).{{sfn|Hoolboom, Frank's Cock}}

The script for ''Frank's Cock'' has been published several times, including in the script anthology ''By the Skin of Their Tongues''{{sfn|Reinke|Henricks|1997|p=67}} and in the ''Journal of Film and Video'' (both 1997).{{sfn|Hoolboom 1997, Three Scripts}} The film influenced Adam Garnet Jones' ''Secret Weapons'' (2008), commissioned by the Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Centre in celebration of its fortieth anniversary. However, unlike ''Frank's Cock'', ''Secret Weapons'' focused on an [[LGBT]] identity within [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canada's native community]].{{sfn|Kashmere 2008, Regeneration}}

After his success at the TIFF, Hoolboom directed numerous further films, many showing a "fascination with its impermanence"; several, including ''Letters From Home'', dealt explicitly with AIDS.{{sfn|McIntosh, Mike Hoolboom}} Rennie, who had also received critical acclaim for his supporting role in [[Mina Shum]]'s ''[[Double Happiness (film)|Double Happiness]]'' (1994), later became known for playing villains in Hollywood films.{{sfn|Czach, Callum Keith Rennie}}
