The '''Royal Mint''' is the body permitted to manufacture, or ''mint'', [[Coins of the pound sterling|coins]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The Mint originated over 1,100 years ago, but since 2010 it operates as Royal Mint Ltd, a company which has an exclusive contract with [[HM Treasury]] to supply all coinage for the UK.<ref name="royal mint 1">{{cite web|title=www.royalmint.com

As well as minting coins for the UK, it also mints and exports coins to many other countries, and produces military [[medal]]s, commemorative medals and other such items for governments, schools and [[business]]es, being known as the world's leading exporting Mint.<ref name="royal mint 1"/> Responsibility for the security of the site falls to the [[Ministry of Defence Police]], who provide an armed contingent.

The Royal Mint began to move its operations from [[Tower Hill]], [[London]] to [[Llantrisant]], South [[Wales]] in 1968 and has operated on a single site in Llantrisant since 1980.<ref name="royal mint 2">{{cite web

At Llantrisant it holds an extensive collection of coins dating from the 16th century onwards, housed in eighty cabinets made by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II's]] cabinet maker, [[Hugh Swann]]. The site occupies {{convert|38|acre}} and employs 765 people.<ref name="royal mint 4">{{cite web|title=www.royalmint.com|url=http://www.royalmint.com/aboutus/ourlocation|accessdate=2012-03-27|publisher=Royal Mint|date=2012-03-27|work=Royal Mint website}}</ref>

The annual [[Trial of the Pyx]] [[Metallurgical assay|assay]]s coins produced for the UK government for size, weight and chemical composition.

==History==
The '''London Mint''' first became a single institution in 886,<ref>Pierce, Andrew. "Royal Mint Reveals New Coin Designs." The Telegraph. April 4, 2008. November 22, 1010. http://forums.canadiancontent.net/news/72674-royal-mint-unveils-new-british.html</ref> during the reign of [[Alfred the Great]], but was only one of many mints throughout the kingdom. By 1279 it had moved to the [[Tower of London]], and remained there the next 500 years, achieving a [[monopoly]] on the production of coins of the realm in the 16th century.  Sir [[Isaac Newton]] took up the post of [[Warden of the Mint]], responsible for investigating cases of counterfeiting, in 1696, and subsequently held the office of [[Master of the Mint|Master of the Royal Mint]] from 1699 until his death in 1727.  He unofficially moved the [[Pound Sterling]] to the [[gold standard]] from [[silver standard|silver]] in 1717.

[[Image:Royal Mint London from 1833 Schmollinger map.jpg|thumb|left|The Royal Mint moved from the Tower of London to new premises ''c.''1809]]By the time Newton arrived, the Mint had expanded to fill several rickety wooden buildings ranged around the outside of the Tower.  In the seventeenth century the processes for minting coins were mechanised and rolling mills and coining presses were installed.  The new machinery and the demand on space in the Tower of London following the outbreak of war with [[France]] led to a decision to move the Mint to an adjacent site in [[East Smithfield]].  The new building, designed by James Johnson and [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]], was completed in 1809, and included space for the new machinery, and accommodation for the officers and staff of the Mint. 
[[File:The old Royal Mint building - geograph.org.uk - 735466.jpg|thumb|The Royal Mint building of the 1880s]]
The building was rebuilt in the 1880s to accommodate new machinery which increased the capacity of the Mint. As technology changed with the introduction of electricity and demand grew, the process of rebuilding continued so that by the 1960s little of the original mint remained, apart from Smirke's 1809 building and the gatehouse in the front.

During WWII, the Royal Mint was bombed by the Germans. The Mint was hit on several different occasions and was put out of commission for three weeks at one point.<ref>Report of the Director of the Royal Mint - 1945</ref>

The Tower Hill site finally reached capacity ahead of decimalisation in 1971, with the need to strike hundreds of millions of new decimal coins, while at the same time not neglecting overseas customers. In 1967 it was announced that the Mint would move away from London to new buildings in [[Llantrisant]], ten miles (16&nbsp;km) north west of [[Cardiff]]. The first phase was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 17 December 1968, and production gradually shifted to the new site over the next seven years until the last coin, a gold sovereign, was struck in London in November 1975. Smirke's 1809 Building is now used as commercial offices by [[BlackRock|Barclays Global Investors]].

On 1 April 1975 the Royal Mint became a [[trading fund]] to help improve its efficiency by requiring it to become self-financing.

In March 2009, the then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Alistair Darling]] began planning to sell off of the Royal Mint.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article5908417.ece | work=The Times | first=Sadie | last=Gray | location=London}}</ref> On 31 December 2009 it ceased to be an [[executive agency]] and its assets were vested in a [[limited company]], Royal Mint Ltd. The owner of the new company became the Royal Mint trading fund, which itself continued to be owned by [[HM Treasury]].

==Role of the Royal Mint==
The Royal Mint exists principally to [[Mint (coin)|mint]] [[Coins of the pound sterling|coins]]  for circulation in the UK.  However, it also manufactures and circulates coins for over 60 other countries,[http://www.royalmint.com/aboutus] mints [[Coin collecting|collectors' coins]], and produces [[Medal|military medals]] and civilian decorations for the [[British Armed Forces|British armed forces]] and [[Chivalric order|orders of chivalry]]. As of 2013, the Royal mint produces approximately 15% of the worlds coin based currency.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23327926 | work=BBC News | title=Made of money: The Royal Mint where cash is banned | date=2013-07-23}}</ref> From the 1970s to 2009, it produced all [[Order of the British Empire]] Insignia, this is now contracted out to companies with a royal warrant of appointment, such as [[Toye, Kenning & Spencer]] Ltd. The Royal Mint in London also produced coins for [[Canada]] until a branch was opened in Ottawa, Canada in 1908. In 1931, control of the Canadian branch mint was passed to the Canadian government and it then became the [[Royal Canadian Mint]].

== Trial of the Pyx ==
The [[Trial of the Pyx]] is the procedure in the United Kingdom for ensuring that newly-[[Mint (coin)|minted]] [[British coinage|coins]] conform to required standards. The trials have been held since the twelfth century, normally once per calendar year, and continue to the present day. The form of the ceremony has been essentially the same since 1282. They are [[trial (law)|trials]] in the full judicial sense, presided over by a [[judge]] with an expert [[jury]] of [[assayer]]s. Trials are now held at the Hall of the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]], having previously taken place at the [[Palace of Westminster]]<ref name="goldsmiths">{{cite web|title=www.thegoldsmiths.co.uk|url=http://www.thegoldsmiths.co.uk/company/trial.htm|accessdate=2008-09-02|publisher=The Goldsmiths' Company|year=2004|work=The Goldsmiths' Company}}</ref> Given modern production methods, it is unlikely that coins would not conform, although this has been a problem in the past as it would have been tempting for the [[Master of the Mint]] to steal [[precious metals]].

The term "Pyx" refers to the [[boxwood (genus)|boxwood]] chest (in [[Greek language|Greek]], <U+03C0><U+03C5><U+03BE><U+03AF><U+03C2>, ''pyxis'') in which coins were placed for presentation to the jury. There is also a Pyx Chapel (or Pyx Chamber) in [[Westminster Abbey]], which was once used for secure storage of the Pyx and related articles.

Coins to be tested are drawn from the regular production of the Royal Mint. The Deputy Master of the Mint must, throughout the year, randomly select several thousand sample coins and place them aside for the Trial. These must be in a certain fixed proportion to the number of coins produced. For example, for every 5,000 bimetallic coins issued, one must be set aside, but for silver [[Maundy money]] the proportion is one in 150.

The jury is composed of [[Freedom of the Company|Freemen]] of the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths|Company of Goldsmiths]], who [[assay]] the coins  provided to decide whether they have been minted within the criteria determined by the relevant Coinage Acts.<ref name="royal mint 3">{{cite web
