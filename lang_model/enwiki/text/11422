==Route description==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}

===Madison County===
NY&nbsp;46 begins at [[New York State Route 12B|NY&nbsp;12B]] in the town of [[Eaton, New York|Eaton]]. NY&nbsp;46 travels north, shortly intersecting [[New York State Route 26|NY&nbsp;26]], and then [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;20]] (US&nbsp;20) in the hamlet of [[Pine Woods, New York|Pine Woods]]. NY&nbsp;46 continues northward, and soon enters the town of [[Stockbridge, New York|Stockbridge]] as Bear Path Road. After a few more miles, NY&nbsp;46 enters the village of [[Munnsville, New York|Munnsville]] as Main Street. NY&nbsp;46 veers to the northwest as it leaves the village of Munnsville. It continues as West Road, until it enters the city of [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]]. NY&nbsp;46 is called Glenwood Ave north of the Glenwood Cemetery. NY&nbsp;46 intersects with [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]]. North of NY&nbsp;5, NY&nbsp;46 is called Main Street. NY&nbsp;46 intersects with [[New York State Route 365A|NY&nbsp;365A]] (Lenox Ave), and continues northwest, crossing over the [[New York State Thruway]] (but doesn't have an interchange with it). NY&nbsp;46 intersects with [[New York State Route 316|NY&nbsp;316]] (Lake Road), and leaves the city of Oneida, and Madison County.

===Oneida County===
Once in [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]], NY&nbsp;46 parallels the abandoned Old Erie Canal. A [[towpath]] is visible on the opposite side. NY&nbsp;46 soon enters the hamlet of [[State Bridge, New York|State Bridge]]. Here, NY&nbsp;46 intersects with [[New York State Route 31|NY&nbsp;31]]. NY&nbsp;46 continues northeast until it intersects with [[New York State Route 49|NY&nbsp;49]]. NY&nbsp;49 intersects with NY&nbsp;46 along Rome&ndash;New London Road as it continues eastward into the city of [[Rome, New York|Rome]].

In Rome, NY&nbsp;46/49 intersects with NY&nbsp;69. NY&nbsp;69 then overlaps with NY&nbsp;46 and NY&nbsp;49 as it continues southeast through Rome as Erie Boulevard West. NY&nbsp;46 then leaves NY&nbsp;49/69 as it continues northeast along Black River Boulevard. Once out of Rome, NY&nbsp;46 enters the town of [[Western, New York|Western]], and follows the upper sections of the [[Mohawk River]], passing by a [[fish hatchery]] as well as [[Delta Lake State Park]]. Beyond Delta Lake, NY&nbsp;46 intersects with [[New York State Route 274|NY&nbsp;274]]. NY&nbsp;46 continues northeast, shortly entering the town of [[Ava, New York]], and then the town of [[Boonville (town), New York|Boonville]], where it serves [[Pixley Falls State Park]].

NY&nbsp;46 enters the village of [[Boonville (village), New York|Boonville]] as Post St. Immediately after intersecting with [[New York State Route 294|NY&nbsp;294]], NY&nbsp;46 ends at [[New York State Route 12D|NY&nbsp;12D]].

==History==
NY&nbsp;46 was assigned in the mid-1920s to an alignment extending from [[Oriskany Falls, New York|Oriskany Falls]] to [[Boonville (village), New York|Boonville]] via [[Rome, New York|Rome]]. The route followed what is now [[New York State Route 26|NY&nbsp;26]] south of Rome (via James Street) and its modern alignment north of the city. Around the same time, the segment of modern NY&nbsp;46 between the [[Verona, New York|Verona]] hamlet of New London and Rome was designated as part of [[New York State Route 49|NY&nbsp;49]] while the portion between [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] in [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]] and [[Oneida Creek]] north of the city became part of [[New York State Route 31|NY&nbsp;31]].<ref name="1924nyt">{{cite news |title=New York's Main Highways Designated by Numbers |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 21, 1924 |page=XX9}}</ref><ref name="1926map">{{cite map |url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewYork/unitedstates1926ra_009.html |title=Rand McNally Auto Road Atlas (eastern New York) |publisher=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1926 |accessdate=May 8, 2010}}</ref> In the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]], NY&nbsp;31 was realigned to bypass Oneida to the north while its former alignment into the city became [[New York State Route 316|NY&nbsp;316]].

[[File:NY-46A (1948).svg|70px|right|link=|alt=]]
[[New York State Route 46A|NY&nbsp;46A]] was a spur of NY&nbsp;46 in [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]]. The route began at [[New York State Route 49|NY&nbsp;49]] south of [[Floyd, New York|Floyd]] and passed through [[Holland Patent, New York|Holland Patent]] and [[Steuben, New York|Steuben]] before ending at NY&nbsp;46 in the [[Western, New York|Western]] hamlet of Frenchville. The route was assigned as part of the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]]<ref name="Road Map of New York"/> and removed in the early 1950s.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Sunoco]] |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1952}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York with Special Maps of Putnam<U+2013>Rockland<U+2013>Westchester Counties and Finger Lakes Region |publisher=[[Esso]] |cartography=[[General Drafting]] |edition=1955<U+2013>56 |year=1954}}</ref>
