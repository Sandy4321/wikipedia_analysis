In performance, Mina combined several modern styles with traditional Italian melodies and [[swing music]], which made her the most versatile pop singer in [[Italian music]].<ref name=carrera/> Mina dominated the Italian charts for fifteen years and reached an unsurpassed level of popularity in Italy.<ref name=biography/> She has scored [[Mina discography|77 albums and 71 singles]] on the Italian charts.<ref name=singles/><ref name=album/>

Mina's TV appearances in 1959 were the first for a female [[rock and roll]] singer in Italy. Her loud syncopated singing earned her the nickname ''Queen of Screamers''.<ref name=cool/>  The public also labeled her the ''Tiger of [[Cremona]]'' for her wild gestures and body shakes. When she turned to light [[traditional pop music|pop tunes]], Mina's chart-toppers in [[West Germany]] in 1962 and [[Japan]] in 1964 earned her the title of the best international artist in these countries.<ref name = german/><ref name=germania/><ref name = fratarcangeli/> Mina's more refined sensual manner was introduced in 1960 with [[Gino Paoli]]'s ballad "[[:it:Il cielo in una stanza/La notte|This World We Love In]]", which charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in 1961.

Mina was banned from Italian TV and radio in 1963 because her pregnancy and relationship with a married actor did not accord with the dominant [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[bourgeois]] [[morals]].<ref name=ninoromano>Mina. Storia di un mito by Nino Romano (Rusconi 1986)</ref> After the ban, the Italian broadcasting service [[RAI]] tried to continue to prohibit her songs, which were forthright in dealing with subjects such as religion, smoking and sex.<ref name=ninoromano/> Mina's [[Cool (aesthetic)|cool]] act combined [[sex appeal]] with public [[Smoking in Italy|smoking]], [[hair coloring|dyed]] blond hair, and shaved [[eyebrows]] to create a "bad girl" image.<ref name = cool/> 

Mina's voice has distinctive [[timbre]] and great power.<ref name=canzone/><ref name=tintarella/> Her main themes are anguished love stories performed in high dramatic tones. The singer combined classic Italian pop with elements of [[blues]], [[R&B]]<ref name="Se stasera sono qui"/> and [[soul music]] during the late 1960s, especially when she worked in collaboration with composer [[Lucio Battisti]]. Top Italian songwriters created material with large vocal ranges and unusual [[chord progression]]s to showcase her singing skills, particularly "Brava" by [[:it:Bruno Canfora|Bruno Canfora]] (1965) and the pseudo-[[serialism|serial]] "Se telefonando" by [[Ennio Morricone]] (1966). The latter song was covered by several performers abroad. [[Shirley Bassey]] carried Mina's ballad "[[Grande grande grande]]" to charts in the U.S., U.K., and other English-speaking countries in 1973. Mina's [[easy listening]] duet "[[Parole parole]]" was turned into a worldwide hit by [[Dalida]] and [[Alain Delon]] in 1974. Mina gave up public appearances in 1978 and has continued to release popular albums on a yearly basis to the present day.

In 1966, Mina started working with the [[Radiotelevisione Svizzera di lingua Italiana|Swiss Broadcasting Service]] and the Orchestra Radiosa in Lugano. She founded the [[independent record label]] [[:it:PDU (casa discografica)|PDU]] in collaboration with her father. The first record issued under the label was ''[[Dedicato a mio padre]]'' (Dedicated to My Father). Mina's growing interest in Brazilian music resulted in "[[:it:La banda/Se c'<U+00E8> una cosa che mi fa impazzire|La banda]]" ("The Band"), a [[Chico Buarque]] song, which reached #3 in Italy. Mina continued to perform on Italian TV, and presented "Zum zum zum" on the spring 1967 variety series ''Sabato sera'', accompanied by the [[NATO]] naval band. The series also included "La coppia pi<U+00F9> bella del mondo" ("The Most Beautiful Couple in the World"), a duet with [[Adriano Celentano]]. The title of the song "Sono, come tu mi vuoi" ("I Am, as You Want Me to Be") was taken from [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s play ''[[:it:Come tu mi vuoi|Come tu mi vuoi]]''.

The team produced a set of songs including "[[:it:Io e te da soli / Credi|Io e te da soli]]" ("You and Me Alone"), "Insieme" ("Together"), "Amor mio" ("Love of Mine"), "Io vivr<U+00F2> senza te" ("I'll Live without You"),<ref name=decoder/><ref name=frieze>{{cite journal|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/jaki_irvine/|title= Jaki Irvine|journal=[[Frieze magazine|Frieze]]|volume= 56|year= 2001}}</ref> "[[:it:E penso a te (Lucio Battisti)|E penso a te]]" ("And I Think of You"). One of the first introductions of the new repertoire was the ''Senza rete'' live televised concert from the Auditorio A in Naples on 20 January 1970. The material provided by Mogol-Battisti was the core for five albums. Among them, ''[[Bugiardo pi<U+00F9> che mai...pi<U+00F9> incosciente che mai...|...bugiardo pi<U+00F9> che mai...pi<U+00F9> incosciente che mai...]]'' was Mina's first independent album to reach #1 of the weekly Italian charts and was the biggest selling album of 1969 in Italy. [[Quando tu mi spiavi in cima a un batticuore|''...quando tu mi spiavi in cima a un batticuore...'']] was seventh on the annual record chart of 1970. ''[[Del mio meglio|Del mio meglio...]]'' (''My Best...'') was second in 1971. ''[[Mina (album)|Mina]]'' was the biggest seller of 1972. The latter two albums were recorded during a break from live performances to give birth to her daughter Benedetta.

Mina's comeback took place at RAI's variety series ''Teatro 10'' in spring 1972. One of the highlights of the series was a selection of Battisti's songs performed in duet with the composer. The shows also included "Balada para mi muerte" ("Ode to My Death"), a [[nuevo tango]] duet with [[<U+00C1>stor Piazzolla]] at the [[bandone<U+00F3>n]], backed by the Argentinian group [[:es:Conjunto 9|Conjunto 9]]. "[[Grande grande grande]]", arranged by [[Pino Presti]],<ref>''Mina - I mille volti di una voce'' by Romy Padovano (Arnoldo Mondadori 1998)</ref> was the second biggest-selling single of the year in Italy.

The final number of the eight ''Teatro 10'' episodes was "[[Parole parole]]" ("Words Words"), a duet with [[Alberto Lupo]]. The song was an [[easy listening]] dialogue between Mina's singing and Lupo's declamation. The theme of the song was hollow words. It intertwined the lady's singing lamentation of the end of love and the lies she had to hear with the male protagonist's [[recitation]]. In the dialog she scoffs at the compliments he gave her, calling them ''parole'' <U+2013> just words. The single was released in April 1972 and topped the Italian charts. It was covered by numerous Italian and French duets.<ref name=parole>[http://www.hitparadeitalia.it/schede/p/parole_parole.htm Parole parole] Hit Parade Italia. In Italian.

Mina lost her husband Virgilio Crocco in a car accident in 1973. She continued her career with the top Italian chart hits "E poi..." ("And Then...") and "L'importante <U+00E8> finire" ("The Important Thing Is to Finish"). She recorded the theme song "Fa presto, fa piano" ("Works Quickly, Works Quietly") for the film ''[[:it:La sculacciata|La sculacciata]]'', issued in 1974.

=== Since 1974 ===
Mina's last live TV appearance was the final episode of the ''Milleluci'' series on 16 March 1974. Mina was the hostess of the series alongside [[Raffaella Carr<U+00E0>]]. During the series, she explored different musical styles in the songs "I Don't Know How to Love Him" from the [[musical film|musical]] ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', "[[Mack the Knife]]", "[[Night and Day (song)|Night and Day]]" and "[[Someday (You'll Want Me to Want You)]]". After "Non gioco pi<U+00F9>" ("The Game Is Over"), a blues duet with the [[harmonica]] player [[Toots Thielemans]], Mina announced her withdrawal from public performances.<ref>[http://www.hitparadeitalia.it/schede/n/non_gioco_piu.htm Non gioco piu] Hit Parade Italia. In Italian. 25 May 2010</ref> Her last appearance on TV was her performance of "Ancora ancora ancora". The video was the final number of the "Mille e una luce" show on 1 July 1978.<ref name="Ancora ancora ancora">[http://www.galleriadellacanzone.it/canzoni/anni70/schede/ancora/ancora.htm Ancora ancora ancora] Galleria della canzone. In Italian. Retrieved 28 June 2007</ref> Her last concert appearances, a series of thirteen fully-booked concerts at La Bussola in 1978, were cut short due to her illness. Mina gave her last public performance on 23 August 1978 at the Bussoladomani theatre. It was recorded and issued as ''[[Mina Live '78]]''.<ref name="Ancora ancora ancora"/> 

Mina continued to release albums on a yearly basis with her son [[:it:Massimiliano Pani|Massimiliano Pani]] as the producer. Between 1972 and 1995, she published a double album each year. From 1973, her LPs and CDs have been characterized by artistic motifs of the designers Luciano Tallarini, Gianni Ronco and the photographer Mauro Balletti. From the mid-1980s, the design of the album covers was trusted to Balletti alone. All of Mina's records under the PDU label have reached the Italian Top 100. A large part of her work has consisted of covering well-known songs; she has dedicated tribute albums to [[The Beatles]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Renato Zero]], [[Domenico Modugno]], the [[Napoli (album)|Neapolitan song]], and [[religious music]]. After leaving the stage, her greatest chart successes have been duets. In 1985, "Questione di feeling", a duet with [[Riccardo Cocciante]], was the 13th biggest-selling single of the year in Italy and became an evergreen (as a hit song is called in Europe). The duet album ''[[Mina Celentano]]'', recorded with [[Adriano Celentano]], was the biggest-selling album of 1998 in Italy. Starting in 1989, all of her records included the jazzy piano playing of [[Danilo Rea]].

The break in Mina's TV appearances lasted until 2001, when she released footage of her recording sessions. The videos were broadcasted over the [[WIND (Italy)|Wind]] internet site on 30 March. This resulted in millions of visits to the site on that night, and additional millions on following days. The footage was released as the DVD ''Mina in Studio''. After the event, Mina's singles started to chart in Italy again. The track "Succhiando l'uva" (2002), written for her by [[Zucchero]], peaked at #3 on the chart. Mina's cover of "Don't call me baby [[Can't Take My Eyes Off You|(Can't take my eyes off you)]]" (2003) reached #4 in Italy. The single "Alibi" (2007) reached #6 in Italy. The triple CD ''[[The Platinum Collection (Mina album)|The Platinum Collection]]'' reached #1 on the Italian charts. So did ''[[Olio (album)|Olio]]'' (1999), ''[[Veleno]]'' (2002), ''[[Bula Bula]]'' (2005) and ''[[Todav<U+00ED>a (album)|Todav<U+00ED>a]]''. Mina's later releases have included duets with [[Mick Hucknall]], [[Fabrizio De Andr<U+00E9>]], [[Piero Pel<U+00F9>]], [[Adriano Celentano]], [[Lucio Dalla]], [[Joan Manuel Serrat]], [[Chico Buarque]], [[Tiziano Ferro]], [[Giorgia Todrani|Giorgia]] and [[Seal (singer)|Seal]].

To demonstrate Mina's vocal range, the composer Bruno Canfora penned the song "Brava", and [[Ennio Morricone]] wrote "Se telefonando" with numerous transitions of tonality.<ref name=cool/><ref name=telefonando/> More songs were composed exclusively for Mina and arranged for RAI's all-star orchestras for performance on the TV variety series ''[[:it:Studio Uno (programma televisivo)|Studio uno]]'', ''Sabato sera'', ''[[:it:Canzonissima|Canzonissima]]'' and ''[[:it:Teatro 10|Teatro 10]]''.

== Personal life ==
In her early teens, Mina was a competitive [[swimmer]] for the Canottieri Baldesio sports club in Cremona, attended by the elite of the Cremonese bourgeoisie at the time.<ref name=decoder>{{cite web|url=http://www.ildecoder.com/elenco/M/MINA=032010.html|title=Mina|publisher=Il decoder|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> She met her first boyfriend, a [[Fullback (association football)|fullback]] for the [[U.S. Cremonese]] football club, at the swimming pool at her age of 16.<ref name=decoder/> 

Mina fell in love with actor Corrado Pani in 1962. Their relationship shocked Italian audiences as he was already married although separated from his wife. Their son, [[:it:Massimiliano Pani|Massimiliano Pani]], was born on 18 April 1963. Due to Mina's refusal to hide the relationship, the singer was banned from performing on public Italian television or radio channels. As her record sales were unaffected and audiences demanded to see Mina on the air, RAI was forced to end the ban and let Mina return to television on 10 January 1964. Within a year, her affair with Corrado ended. 

Mina's brother Alfredo Mazzini died in a car accident in 1965. A year later she and her father moved to [[Lugano]], [[Switzerland]]. Mina's intimate relationships, however, remained in Italy, as she had a brief affair with the actor [[Walter Chiari]]. A later relationship with actor [[Gian Maria Volont<U+00E9>]] ended after she found out about Volont<U+00E8>'s affair with an actress. Mina's great love of the late 1960s, with whom she had a relationship that lasted three years and almost led to marriage, was the composer Augusto Martelli. Her second spouse was Virgilio Crocco, a journalist for [[Il Messaggero]], in 1970. As a result of their marriage, her legal name was changed for Anna Maria Mazzini Crocco.<ref name=svizzera>{{cite news|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1989/11/07/da-ieri-mina-diventata-cittadina-svizzera.html|newspaper=[[la Repubblica]]|title=Da ieri Mina e' diventata cittadina svizzera (Yesterday Mina acquired Swiss citizenship)|language=Italian|date=7 November 1989}}</ref> Their daughter [[:it:Benedetta Mazzini|Benedetta Mazzini]] was born on 11 November 1971.
