'''Aggie Bonfire''' was a long-standing tradition at [[Texas A&M University]] as part of the [[college rivalry]] with the [[University of Texas at Austin]], known as [[t.u.]] <!--Link to disambiguation page offers more information on this topic-->by Texas A&M students.<ref name="dictionary">{{citation|title=Aggie Dictionary|date=2007|newspaper=The Bryan-College Station Eagle|accessdate=[[2007-08-26]] |url=http://www.aggiesports.com/traditions/school/dictionary.htm}}</ref><ref name="sherrington">{{citation|last=Sherrington|first=Kevin|title=Aggies might appreciate coach's gigging|date=[[August 20]], [[2007]]|newspaper=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|accessdate=[[2007-08-26]]|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/colleges/topstories/stories/082007dnsposherrington.380f9a5.html}}</ref><!--reference here is because FA reviewers were confused-->   For ninety years, Texas A&M students built and burned a [[bonfire]] on campus each fall.

It has no other use than to substantiate the quote-->  The bonfire was traditionally lit around [[Thanksgiving]] in conjunction with festivities surrounding the annual [[college football]] game.

Although early Bonfires were little more than piles of trash, as time passed the annual event became more organized. Over the years  the bonfire grew to an immense size, setting the world record in 1969. In [[1999]]<!--Linked to 1999 because this was a significant event that year-->, the Bonfire collapsed during construction, killing twelve people, eleven students and one former student, and injuring twenty-seven&nbsp;others.  

The tragedy led Texas A&M to declare a hiatus on an official Bonfire. However, since 2002, a student-sponsored coalition has constructed an annual unsanctioned, off-campus "Student Bonfire" in the spirit of its predecessor.

==Early years==
The students of the [[History of Texas A&M University|Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas]], known as Aggies, burned their first [[bonfire]] on [[18 November]] [[1907]] to congratulate the [[college football|football]] team on a recent win.<ref>{{cite web|title=Traditions|publisher=[[Texas A&M University]]| url= http://traditions.tamu.edu/new/index.php?q=traditions#bonfire |accessdate=2007-08-16}}</ref> The first [[Texas A&M University campus|on-campus]] Aggie Bonfire, a heap of trash and debris, was burned in 1909 to generate enthusiasm for a variety of sporting events.  A decade later, the focus of the event narrowed to the annual rivalry game between Texas A&M and the University of Texas, held near [[Thanksgiving Day]].<ref name="bernstein"/>  Little information was recorded about the early Bonfires; the 1921 Texas A&M yearbook mentioned the "final rally" of the students before the game against Texas, but did not refer to a bonfire. Six years later, the school yearbook published a photograph of the event.<ref name="smith2007">{{citation|last=Smith|first=Jonathan M.|date=2007|title=The Texas Aggie Bonfire: A Conservative Reading of Regional Narratives, Traditional Practices, and a Paradoxical Place|newspaper=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|pages=182<U+2013>201|accessdate=[[2007-08-15]]|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.2007.00530.x}}</ref> 

Freshmen were expected to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth.<ref name="smith2007"/>  For almost two decades, the students constructed Bonfire from debris and wood acquired through various, sometimes illicit, means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912.<ref name="as" >{{citation   | title = Vanities of the Bonfire   | newspaper = American Scientist  | date = November<U+2013>December 2000  |volume=88|issue=6|  doi = 10.1511/2000.6.486 | accessdate = 2007-02-28|page=486 }}</ref>  In 1935, a farmer reported that members of the [[Texas A&M University Corps of Cadets|Corps of Cadets]] carried off his entire barn to serve as fuel for Bonfire.  To prevent future incidents, the university made Bonfire a school-sanctioned event. The following year, for the first time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for the students and pointed them towards a grove of dead trees on the edge of town.<ref name="bernstein"/> 

During the 1940s, [[The Battalion|the school paper]] described Bonfire as "'the greatest event of the football season'".<ref name="smith2007"/>  The 1947 [[Texas A&M Corps of Cadets|Corps]] handbook stated that "bonfire symbolizes two things; a burning desire to beat the team from the University of Texas, and the undying flame of love that every loyal Aggie carries in his heart for the school;"  this was often shorted to "the burning desire to beat the hell out of t.u."<ref name="smith2007"/><!--this reference says only that A&M students call UT "tu"--><ref name="sherrington"/>
The Bonfire design changed in 1942.  [[Universal Studios]], filming the movie ''[[We've Never Been Licked]]'' on the Texas A&M Campus, built a bonfire as a prop for the movie.  Their structure used a design simliar to a [[teepee]] where all the logs rested against each other in a conical shape.<ref name="smith2007"/> The logs were placed at an angle between 23 and 30&nbsp;degrees, giving it "a tremendous vertical and horizontal resistance".<ref name="burka2000">{{citation|last=Burka|first=Paul|title=The Aggie Bonfire Tragedy|newspaper=[[Texas Monthly]]|date=April 2000|page=116|edition=Vol. 28, Issue 4}}</ref>  This allowed Bonfire to grow from <span style="white-space:nowrap">25&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(10&nbsp;m)</span> tall to over <span style="white-space:nowrap">50&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(20&nbsp;m)</span> tall.<ref name="as"/>  Aggies adopted the change, and the teepee design was standard for Bonfires for the next twenty-five years.<ref name="smith2007"/> 

Beginning in 1952, Bonfire was made from only fresh-cut logs.<ref name="smith2007"/>  The event suffered its first fatality in 1955, when a student was struck by a swerving car.<ref name="bernstein"/>  In an unrelated move the same year, the Bonfire site changed from Simpson Drill Field in front of the Memorial Student Center to Duncan Field, near the Corps of Cadets dorms.  In 1957, Bonfire collapsed two days before its scheduled burn day.  Students worked around-the-clock to rebuild the structure, and finished the Bonfire as scheduled.<ref name="homeland"/>

During this time period, University of Texas students, unhappy with the symbolism of Bonfire, tried multiple times to ignite the stack early to no avail.  In 1933, and 1948, students from the school rented an airplane and dropped fire bombs onto the stack.  In 1956, they attempted to plant explosives at the Bonfire site.<ref name="homeland"/> Additionally, in the late 1970s, a [[College Station, Texas|College Station]] police officer was fired after trying to ignite Bonfire several days ahead of schedule.  Students spotted the officer and chased him across campus before he could succeed.<ref name="bernstein"/>

==Organizational change and expansion==
In 1965, membership in the [[Texas A&M University Corps of Cadets|Corps of Cadets]] became voluntary for students at Texas A&M.  Before, Corps leaders directed construction of Bonfire. However, because the Corps had no authority over the "non-regs", or civilian students, a separate [[Aggie Bonfire Leadership|Bonfire leadership]] structure was instituted.  The new leaders were designated with colored [[hard hats]], or pots, with the overall leaders known as redpots.<ref name="smith2007"/>

The first Bonfire built with both Corps and non-reg participation was in 1963.<ref name="creel"/>  The stack was scheduled to burn only days after the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]] of  [[US President|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]].  Out of respect, the students dismantled the stack.<ref name="bernstein"/>  As [[Aggie Yell Leaders|Head Yell Leader]] Mike Marlowe explained, "It is the most we have and the least we can give."<ref name="creel" >{{citation  | last = Creel  | first = Brady   | title =...And they call it "Aggie Bonfire"| newspaper = The Battalion  | date = [[November 19]], [[2001]]  | url =http://media.www.thebatt.com/media/storage/paper657/news/2001/11/19/Opinion/.and-They.Call.It.aggie.Bonfire-516424.shtml  | accessdate = [[2007-02-28]] }}</ref>

In the following years the structure became more elaborate, and in 1967 the flames could be seen <span style="white-space:nowrap">25&nbsp;[[mile]]s&nbsp;(40&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]])</span> away.  In 1969, the stack of logs set the world record for the height of a bonfire at 109&nbsp;ft, 10&nbsp;in (30&nbsp;m) tall.<ref name="bernstein"/><ref name="WorldRec">{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Dave|date=[[December 8]], [[1999]]|url=http://www.salon.com/books/it/1999/12/08/bonfire/index.html|title=Memories of an Aggie bonfire boy |publisher=[[Salon.com]]|accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref>  Out of concern for the safety of participants and the community, the university limited the size to <span style="white-space:nowrap">55&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(20&nbsp;m)</span> tall and <span style="white-space:nowrap">45&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(10&nbsp;m)</span> in diameter.<ref name="as"/>  As an added precaution, nearby campus buildings were equipped with rooftop [[Fire sprinkler system|sprinkler systems]].  Despite the new height restrictions, in the 1970s, the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' listed Aggie Bonfire as the largest Bonfire in the world.<ref name="bernstein"/>

==Design change==
In 1978, Bonfire shifted from its previous teepee design to a [[wedding cake]] style, in which upper stacks of logs were wedged on top of lower stacks. The structure was built around a fortified center pole, made from two [[telephone poles]] spliced together by cutting matching notches, approximately <span style="white-space:nowrap">10&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]]&nbsp;(3&nbsp;[[metre|m]])</span> long, and with five gallons of glue.  Four steel plates were bolted to the two poles, and a <span style="white-space:nowrap">.375&nbsp;[[inch]]es&nbsp;(1&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]])</span> cable wrapped around the joint and secured to the pole with steel staples. Four perimeter poles were placed <span style="white-space:nowrap">150&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(46&nbsp;m)</span> away and ropes were stretched between the perimeter poles to center poles and tension placed on them to hold the center pole together.  After the center pole was erected, logs were placed vertically around it in a multi-tiered wedding cake design composed of thousands of logs.<ref name="homeland"/>  By 1984, the logs were sloping only [[Degree (angle)|14&nbsp;degrees]].<ref name="burka2000"/>  The [[spiral]] arrangement of the logs was designed to make Bonfire collapse into itself in a twisting motion, thus protecting spectators.<ref name="homeland"/>  Although the tradition stated that if Bonfire burned through midnight then A&M would win the following day's [[College football|football]] game, the introduction of the wedding cake design drastically reduced the time it took for Bonfire to fall, sometimes burning for only 30 or 45&nbsp;minutes.<ref name="burka2000"/>

While the Bonfires of the 1960s were constructed in five to ten days, working primarily in daylight, by the late 1970s, changes in the school led to a more elaborate and lengthy construction schedule.<ref name="smith2007"/>  Construction began in late October with "Cut", obtaining wood by cutting down trees with axes, which took several weekends.<ref name="smith2007"/><ref name="homeland"/>  After Cut, students brought the logs to campus during "Load", a process by which the logs were loaded by hand onto flatbed trucks and brought to campus.<ref name="homeland"/>  In early November, crews began "Stack", a three-week period in which the logs were wired together and Bonfire took shape.  Near the end of stack, known as "Push", students worked around the clock in rotating shifts.  The first four of the six stacks were built with the efforts of all safety-trained participants.  The day before Bonfire was scheduled to burn, junior redpots would build the fifth stack, and then senior redpots would build the sixth.<ref name="homeland"/>  

To ensure safety during the Stack period, the organizers maintained a perimeter around the working area, and allowed only safety-trained students through.  Cranes, donated by local construction companies, assisted in getting logs onto the upper tiers, and volunteers from those companies were on-hand at all times to offer advice.  [[Emergency medical technicians]] were also required to be on site at all times and no more than 70&nbsp;students at a time were allowed on the stack.<ref name="homeland">{{cite web  | last = Cook  | first = John Lee, Jr.| title = Bonfire Collapse  | publisher = U.S. Department of Homeland Security  | url =http://www.usfa.dhs.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/tr-133-508.pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-03 }}</ref>  Once the stack was finished, "an [[outhouse]] painted orange [symbolizing a] [[University of Texas|t.u.]] [[fraternity|frat]] house"<ref name="matthewwatkins">{{citation|last=Watkins|first=Matthew|title=Thousands gather to witness evolving Aggie tradition|date=[[November 22]], [[2006]]|url=http://www.theeagle.com/stories/112206/am_20061122025.php|newspaper=The Bryan-College Station Eagle|accessdate=[[2007-08-26]]}}</ref><ref name="turef">{{citation |last=Geisler|first=Erin|title=UT Feature Story&mdash;Hook 'Em or Gig 'Em?: Professor uses college football rivalry as context for research on social comparison | publisher=[[University of Texas]] Public Relations |url=http://www.utexas.edu/features/archive/2004/football.html |accessdate=[[2007-08-25]]}}</ref> was bedecked with derogatory statements about rival University of Texas at Austin and then placed on top of the stack.<ref name="eagle1">{{citation |title=A Time to Grieve | date=[[November 20]], [[1998]] | newspaper=The Bryan-College Station Eagle |url=http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/201199e.htm |accessdate=[[2007-01-05]]}}</ref>

Although between two and five thousand students participated in the construction of Bonfire each year, most worked only part time, and many worked only one or two shifts.<ref name="smith2007"/>  Student workers were organized by dormitories or Corps units, with a separate off-campus student team.  Many former students  participated with teams they belonged to as students.  Each team had assigned shifts, although individuals were not limited to working only the assigned shifts.<ref name="homeland"/>  Students working on Bonfire wore "grodes"&mdash;old t-shirts, jeans, and boots.  By tradition, grodes were either not washed until after Bonfire burned or not washed at all.<ref name="stratton">{{cite book|last=Stratton  |first=W.K.|title=Backyard Brawl: Inside the Blood Feud Between Texas and Texas A&M||publisher = Crown| date =[[September 3]], [[2002]]| pages =100<U+2013>101 | isbn = 0609610538}}</ref>

In 1983, the city of College Station began manufacturing [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] [[city limits]] signs for students to place at the summit of the Bonfire so that students would stop stealing signs from Austin.<ref name="bernstein"/>  The [[Fightin' Texas Aggie Band]] began building the outhouse, ending the tradition of stealing Bonfire's components.

==Controversy==
Although women were allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both [[Aggie Bonfire#Organizational change|Cut and Stack]].  The ban was partially rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts.<ref name="smith2007"/>   In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them as they tried to take pictures of the raising of the center pole.  The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack.<ref name="bragg">{{Citation|last=Bragg|first=Roy|title=Aggie bonfire creating heat prematurely|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|date=[[November 19]], [[1987]]|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1987_503850|accessdate=[[2007-08-16]]}}</ref>  To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.<ref name="women" >{{citation  | last = Lebas  | first = John    | title = Women Have Increasing Role in Bonfire  | newspaper = The Bryan-College Station Eagle  | date = [[November 19]], [[1999]]  | url = http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/191199d.htm    | accessdate = [[2007-02-28]]}}</ref>

Injuries plagued the construction process.  In 1981, student Wylie Keith Joplinn died after being run over by a tractor at the Cut site.<ref name="chron15Nov1989"/>  At the 1985 Cut site, one student broke his hip,<ref name="bragg1985"/> and, in 1989, another student lost two fingers when logs crushed his hand.<ref name="rugeley"/>  Fractures and amputations were rare, but many students suffered cuts, scrapes, or exposure to [[poison ivy]].<ref name="bernstein"/><ref name="bragg1985"/>

The 1980s also saw increased alcohol consumption during the Bonfire ceremony.  In 1988, police issued 140 [[Minor In Possession]] citations and arrested six people.  The following year, the local police department brought a [[paddywagon]] to the site for the first time, as they anticipated mass arrests for alcohol violations.<ref name="rugeley">{{citation|last=Rugeley|first=Cindy|title='It's just gotten out of hand'/Critics seek to smother spirited flames of Aggies' annual bonfire celebration|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=[[November 26]], [[1989]]|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1989_666543|accessdate=[[2007-08-16]]}}</ref>  As many as 150 police officers were on duty during the Bonfire burning from the Texas A&M and College Station police departments and the [[Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission]].<ref name="fox"/>

In 1989, the Campus Ministry Association, representing 17&nbsp;religious denominations, unanimously approved a resolution asking the university to change Bonfire because of concerns about safety, participant academic performance, humanitarian considerations, and the environment.  Shortly afterwards, the Faculty Senate's Committee of the Whole approved a resolution asking for a panel that explored alternatives to Bonfire.<ref name="chron15Nov1989">{{Citation|title=Smoldering debate: Two A&M groups seeking way to cool off Aggie bonfire|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|date=[[November 15]], [[1989]]|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1989_664199|accessdate=[[2007-08-16]]}}</ref>

Although students protested Bonfire's environmental impact since 1970, no changes were made for decades.<ref name="smith2007"/> In 1990, a student, Scott Hantman, asked the Bonfire leadership to help him address the problem.  The group solicited volunteers, and in the spring of 1991, they planted 400&nbsp;trees.  The tradition, [[Aggie Replant]], has been repeated every year since. Replant became an organization independent of Bonfire in 1994 when it gained its own Student Government Committee.<ref name="Replant">{{cite web |url = http://replant.tamu.edu/whoweare/history.html |title = History |accessdate = 2006-12-24  |publisher = Texas Aggie Replant }}</ref>

==Later years==
After being held at the Duncan Intramural Fields on the south side of A&M's campus for twenty-seven years, in 1992, Bonfire was relocated to the Polo Fields on the northwest corner of campus.  This more isolated site, with a larger area for people to gather, made it a safer location.<ref name="move">{{Citation|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|title=Aggies to move site of annual bonfire|date=[[March 25]], [[1992]]|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1992_1045135|accessdate=[[2007-08-16]]}}</ref>   After heavy rains in 1994, the partially completed Bonfire began to slowly lean to the side as the soil underneath shifted.  Student officials had enough warning to clear the area and tear down the Bonfire one week before its scheduled burn date.<ref name="bernstein" >{{citation  | last = Bernstein  | first = Alan  | title = Aggie Bonfire holds distinction as Texas symbol    | newspaper= The Houston Chronicle  | date = [[November 18]], [[1999]]  | url =http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/bonfire/386353.html  | accessdate = [[2007-02-28]] }}</ref><ref name="women"/>  Nine tractors, two bulldozers, and two forklifts dismantled the stack, which, at 70% completed, stood <span style="white-space:nowrap">40&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]]&nbsp;(10&nbsp;[[metre|m]])</span> tall and <span style="white-space:nowrap">45&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(10&nbsp;m)</span> wide.<ref name="stewart">{{citation|last=Stewart|first=Richard|last2=Ortiz|first2=Jose de Jesus|title=A&M will go full tilt again at wood tower|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|date=[[October 27]], [[1994]]|accessdate=[[2007-08-16]]|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1994_1234628}}</ref>

The 1994 collapse of Bonfire was witnessed by thousands of people around the world.  The Texas A&M Department of Computer Science set up a camera aimed at the Bonfire site that took a picture every 10 minutes and posted it on the Internet.  On the day of the collapse over 29,000 visitors visited the web page, at a time when only 20 million people worldwide had Internet access.<ref name="silverman">{{citation|last=Silverman|first=Dwight|title=Hullabaloo.caneck.caneck: Aggies burn up Internet|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|date=[[October 29]], [[1994]]|accessdate=[[2007-08-16]]|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1994_1234991}}</ref>

In 1996, a student died in a car accident on his way home from Cut.

In its later years, students building Bonfire used logs donated by local landowners who wanted their land cleared for construction or farming.<ref name="homeland"/>  Over 8000&nbsp;logs were used each year in the late 1990s, taking about 5000&nbsp;students a combined 125,000&nbsp;man-hours to construct.<ref name="as"/>  After being doused in 700&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (318&nbsp;[[Kilogram|kg]]) of [[kerosene|jet fuel]], applied by staff members at A&M's Fire Training School, the [[Yell Leaders]], [[Drum Major]]s, and Redpots then lit the stack with torches the night before the annual football game against the University of Texas when at home and two nights before the game when it was played in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].<ref name="homeland"/>

This event was very popular amongst current and former students and people traveled from all over the state and the nation to observe the burning of Bonfire.

Students, including the entire Texas A&M football team and many members of the university's Corps of Cadets, rushed to the site to assist rescue workers with manually removing the logs.<ref name="homeland"/><ref name="bowen" >{{citation  | last = Bowen  | first = Larry  | title = Football Players Assist in Rescue | newspaper = The Bryan-College Station Eagle  | date = [[November 19]], [[1999]]  | url = http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/191199e.htm  | accessdate = [[2007-02-28]] }}</ref>  The Texas A&M [[civil engineering]] department was also called on to examine the site and help the workers decide the order the logs could be safely removed, and, at the request of the [[Texas Forest Service]], Steely Lumber Company in [[Huntsville, Texas]] sent log-moving equipment and operators.<ref name="homeland"/><ref name="morton"/>  Bonfire survivor John Comstock was the last living person to be removed from the stack.

=== Aggie family unites===
Within minutes of the collapse, word of the accident spread amongst students and the community. Before sunrise, the accident was the subject of news reports around the world.  Within hours, 50&nbsp;satellite trucks were broadcasting from the Texas A&M campus.<ref name="homeland"/> At noon, students held an impromptu prayer service in the center of campus, at Rudder Fountain.<ref name="whitmarsch" >{{citation  | last = Whitmarsch  | first = Geneva   | title = Thousands Mourn Fallen Aggies  | newspaper = The Bryan-College Station Eagle  | date = [[November 26]], [[1999]]  | url = http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/261199a.htm | accessdate = [[2007-02-28]] }}</ref> An official memorial service was held less than seventeen hours after the collapse.  Over 16,000&nbsp;mourners, including [[Texas]] [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Rick Perry]], packed [[Reed Arena]] to pay tribute to those who died and those who had spent all day trying to rescue the injured.  At the end of the service, as A&M University President Ray Bowen presented roses to the families of the dead and injured students, the crowd spontaneously stood in silence, linking arms with those standing next to them, before quietly singing ''[[Amazing Grace]]''.  Only after all of the rescue workers and family members had left the facility did the audience depart.<ref name="opiela" >{{cite web  | last = Opiela  | first = Eric    | title = Bonfire Memorial Service   | publisher = Texas A&M University  | date = [[November 19]], [[1999]]  | url = http://www.msc.tamu.edu/traditions/bonfire/1999/programs/  | accessdate = 2007-02-28 }}</ref>

On [[25 November]] [[1999]], the date that Bonfire would have burned, Aggies instead held a vigil and remembrance ceremony.  Over 40,000&nbsp;people lit candles and observed up to two hours of silence at the site of the collapse, before walking to [[Kyle Field]] for [[Midnight Yell|yell practice]].  At the stadium, fans spontaneously relit their candles as the Parsons Mounted Calvary fired the Aggie cannon twelve times, once for each victim.  Former President [[George H.W. Bush]] and his wife [[Barbara Bush|Barbara]] and [[Texas Governor]] [[George W. Bush]] and his wife [[Laura Bush|Laura]] attended the remembrance ceremony.<ref name="whitmarsch" >{{citation | last = Whitmarsch  | first = Geneva  | title = Thousands Mourn Fallen Aggies   | newspaper = The Bryan-College Station Eagle  | date = [[November 26]], [[1999]]  | url = http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/261199a.htm   | accessdate = [[2007-02-28]] }}</ref>

The following day, the Aggies upset the [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas Longhorns]], winning 20&ndash;16 in the [[Lone Star Showdown|annual rivalry game]].  The game began with a flyover of [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] jets, all piloted by former A&M students, in the [[missing man formation]].  At halftime, the [[The University of Texas Longhorn Band|Texas Longhorn Band]] dedicated their performance to the students lost and injured in the collapse, and ended by playing ''Amazing Grace'' and ''[[Taps]]'', then removing their white hats in a show of respect as they walked off the field.  The [[Fightin' Texas Aggie Band]] also played a tribute to the fallen and, contrary to the usual tradition, marched off the field in a silent cadence.  The stadium was so quiet that a baby's cry was the only noise heard throughout the crowd of over 86,000.<ref name="barker">{{cite video | people = Barker, Bob | title = The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band 1999&ndash;2000 (Production #121d) | medium = DVD | publisher = Barker Video Productions | date = 2000 }}</ref>  Aggie students, who normally sit only when the opposing band plays, stood throughout both performances and gave both standing ovations.<ref name="lebas" >{{citation | last = Lebas  | first = John  | title = Aggies Conquer 'Horns and Heartache  | newspaper= The Bryan-College Station Eagle  | date = [[November 27]], [[1999]]  | url = http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/271199a.htm  | accessdate = [[2007-02-28]] }}</ref>

The Bonfire Memorial Commission collected the hundreds of thousands of items that were left by grieving visitors at the site of the collapse.  At the Systems Building, Texas A&M leaders erected pictures of the deceased students.  There, over a dozen seniors left behind their hard-earned [[Traditions of Texas A&M University#Aggie Ring|Aggie rings]], permanently donating them to the students who did not live long enough to earn their own.<ref name="baggett" >{{citation  | last = Baggett  | first = Donnis | title = Spirit Obvious in Aggieland   | newspaper = The Bryan-College Station Eagle  | date = [[November 28]], [[1999]]  | url = http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/281199.htm  | accessdate = [[2007-02-28]] }}</ref>  Various organizations also established funds to memorialize the victims and to help with expenses incurred because of the accident.  In total, the funds received over [[US$]]250,000.<ref name="homeland"/>

== Aftermath and controversy==

A commission created by Texas A&M University discovered that a number of factors led to the Bonfire collapse, including "excessive internal stresses" on the logs and "inadequate containment strength" in the wiring used to tie the logs together.  The wiring broke after logs from upper tiers were "wedged" into lower tiers.<ref name="homeland"/>

Detractors further blamed the school for the accident, saying that, in the name of tradition, administrators turned a blind eye to an unsafe structure being constructed with minimal engineering and safety protocols.  Before the collapse, some<!-- a nonspecific term indicating not all--> people expressed concerns about the safety of Bonfire, citing the partial collapse that occurred in a previous Bonfire, the progressively shorter Bonfire burn times (collapse of the stack after lighting dropped from several hours to less than 20&nbsp;minutes), and numerous incidents involving alcohol or unsafe horseplay at the Bonfire site. At least two of the students killed in the 1999 Bonfire collapse were beneath the legal drinking age yet their autopsy results showed high [[Blood alcohol level|blood-alcohol levels]], however, inconsistencies in the test results led to questions about their accuracy.<ref name="brown">{{citation  | last =Brown  | first =Kelly  |  title =Alcohol reports on victims released  | newspaper = The Bryan-College Station Eagle  | date = [[May 3]], [[2000]]  | url =http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/may2000/050300alcholfindings.htm  | accessdate = [[2007-06-18]] }}</ref><ref name="pierce"/> 

Parents of students injured or killed in the 1999 collapse filed lawsuits against Texas A&M officials, including President Ray Bowen, Vice President of Student Affairs J. Malon Southerland, the 1999 redpots, and the university.<ref name="lebas">{{citation  | last = LeBas  | first = John   | title = Suits claim A&M tried to skirt Bonfire liability  | newspaper = The Bryan-College Station Eagle  | date = [[June 23]], [[2002]]  | url =http://www.theeagle.com/aandmnews/062302bonfireclaims.htm   | accessdate = [[2007-03-13]] }}</ref>  In one of the six lawsuits, plaintiffs alleged that A&M officials violated the Bonfire victims' right of due process by placing those victims in a  "state-created danger" by not ensuring Bonfire's structural integrity and by allowing unqualified students to work on the stack.<ref name="pierce">{{citation  | last =Pierce  | first =Carrie  | title = Court says A&M is not liable in Bonfire lawsuit  | newspaper = [[The Battalion]]  | date = [[June 2]], [[2004]]  | url =http://media.www.thebatt.com/media/storage/paper657/news/2004/06/02/News/Court.Says.Am.Is.Not.Liable.In.Bonfire.Lawsuit-683943.shtml  | accessdate = [[2007-03-13]] }}</ref>  The plaintiffs pointed to a $2&nbsp;million liability policy the university obtained in 1996 and [[accidental death and dismemberment insurance]] policies that the university obtained for student workers as early as 1987 as proof that the administrators knew of the dangers of Bonfire.  Texas A&M maintains that the insurance policies were actually purchased by an advisory committee to Bonfire and not the university.<ref name="lebas"/>  On [[21 May]], [[2004]], Federal Judge [[Samuel B.

The Texas Board of Professional Engineers announced in 2000 that the Aggie Bonfire met the requirements to be considered a complex construction project that should be regulated by state engineering laws.  If Bonfire is resumed by the university in its former state, it will have to be designed and overseen by a professional engineer.<ref name="lee">{{citation  | last =Lee  | first =Christopher   | title =Bonfire supervision mandated  | newspaper = The Bryan-College Station Eagle  | date = [[June 15]], [[2000]]  | url =http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/june2000/061500bonfiredecisionfolo.htm  | accessdate = [[2007-06-18]]}}</ref>

Bonfire was postponed until 2002 to restructure it to make it safer.  Delays in the development of a safety plan, and a high estimated cost (primarily due to [[liability insurance]]), led A&M president Ray Bowen to cancel Bonfire again.<ref name="milloy">{{citation  | last = Milloy  | first = Ross E.| title = National Briefing | Southwest: Texas: Aggie President Cancels Bonfire  | newspaper=[[The New York Times]]  | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E5DA113DF936A35751C0A9649C8B63|date=[[February 5]], [[2002]] | accessdate = [[2007-03-03]] }}</ref>  Bowen's successor [[Robert Gates]] upheld this decision, stating that a "change in the status quo regarding the future of Bonfire would be inappropriate while litigation is still on-going".<ref name="mclaren">{{citation  | last = McLaren  | first = Janet| title = Gates: Bonfire will not burn in Fall 2003 | newspaper=[[The Battalion]]  | url =http://media.www.thebatt.com/media/storage/paper657/news/2003/02/27/FrontPage/Gates.Bonfire.Will.Not.Burn.In.Fall.2003-514883.shtml|date=[[February 27]], [[2003]] | accessdate = [[2007-03-03]] }}</ref>

A memorial was constructed on the university polo fields, the site of the accident.

*Spirit Ring &ndash; The ring surrounds the site of the collapse and represents the spirit that brought the students together. Twelve portals are placed around the ring, oriented toward each student's hometown.

==Continuation==
[[Image:Aggiebonfire2005.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The 2005 Student Bonfire]]
Despite the university's refusal to allow Bonfire to take place on campus, a non-university sanctioned Bonfire took its place. The first of the unofficial Bonfires was held in 2002 and was known as the "Unity Project." This fire consisted of three piles of wood, with the center stack being <span style="white-space:nowrap">35&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(10&nbsp;m)</span> high.<ref name="badger">{{citation | title = Off-campus Texas A&M bonfire brings out thousands | newspaper=The Badger Herald  | url =http://badgerherald.com/news/2002/11/26/offcampus_texas_a_m_.php|date=[[November 26]], [[2002]] | accessdate = [[2007-03-03]] }}</ref>

In 2003, the event became known as Student Bonfire.  In a design approved by a professional engineer, Student Bonfire uses a wedding cake design, but, in a departure from tradition, every log in the stack touches the ground.  For added support, four <span style="white-space:nowrap">24&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(10&nbsp;m)</span> poles are spaced evenly around stack and then bolted to the <span style="white-space:nowrap">45&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(10&nbsp;m)</span> center pole with a steel pipe.  These poles are known as Windle-sticks, after Levi Windle, a staunch supporter of Student Bonfire who died in an unrelated accident in 2003.<ref name="windle">{{citation| last=Moghe|first=Sonia| title = Off-campus bonfire|newspaper=The Battalion  | url =http://media.www.thebatt.com/media/storage/paper657/news/2005/11/17/News/OffCampus.Bonfire-1108094.shtml|date=[[November 17]], [[2005]] | accessdate = [[2007-03-03]] }}</ref><ref name="hensley">{{citation|last=Hensley |first=Laura | title = A year after fiasco, student bonfire set to burn | newspaper=The Bryan-College Station Eagle  | url =http://www.theeagle.com/stories/110106/am_20061101007.php|date=[[November 1]], [[2006]] | accessdate = [[2007-03-03]] }}</ref> Since the group does not receive funding, Student Bonfire charges a small fee to each attendee to cover expenses.  Attendance for Student Bonfire ranges from 8,000-15,000&nbsp;people and the event is held in [[Brazos County, Texas|Brazos County]] or one of the surrounding counties.<ref name="windle"/>
