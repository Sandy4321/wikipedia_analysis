==Career==
===Early work, 1986&ndash;1998===
When Heigl was nine, an aunt visiting the family decided to take a number of photographs of her. After returning to her home in New York, her aunt sent the photos to a number of [[modeling agency|modeling agencies]], with the permission of Heigl's parents. Within a few weeks, Heigl was signed with [[Wilhelmina Models]] as a [[child model]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Katherine Heigl |url=http://www.people.com/people/katherine_heigl |title=Katherine Heigl |work=People.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-14}}</ref> Soon after signing with the agency, a client slated Heigl for use in a magazine advertisement where she made her debut. At the time, she was earning $75 an hour posing for [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]] and [[Lord & Taylor]] catalogs.
Heigl appeared in her first national television spot for [[Cheerios]] cereal.

She made her acting debut in the 1992 movie ''[[That Night]]''. Heigl appeared as Christina Sebastian in [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era drama ''[[King of the Hill (film)|King of the Hill]]'' before being cast in her first leading role in the 1994 [[comedy]] ''[[My Father the Hero (1994 film)|My Father the Hero]]''. During this time, Heigl continued to attend [[New Canaan High School]], balancing her film and modeling work with her academic studies. Heigl dropped out of New Canaan High School after her sophomore year to pursue her career in Hollywood.

In 1995, she starred in the [[Steven Seagal]] [[action movie|action]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] ''[[Under Siege 2: Dark Territory]]''. Heigl portrayed a 16-year-old travelling on a train across a mountain pass to visit the grave of her deceased father with uncle [[Casey Ryback]] (Seagal), an ex-[[United States Navy SEALs|SEAL]] counter-terrorist expert. The main plotline has the train hijacked by mercenaries in [[Colorado]], keeping her as a hostage. Much of her work in the film was opposite [[Morris Chestnut]], [[Sandra Taylor]] and [[Everett McGill]].

Despite an increased focus on acting, she still modeled extensively, appearing regularly in magazines such as ''[[Seventeen (magazine)|Seventeen]]''. She took the lead role in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s made-for-television film ''[[Wish Upon a Star]]'' in 1996. Also in 1996, Heigl's parents divorced and her mother was diagnosed with [[cancer]].<ref name=HeiglSunTimes/> After her high school graduation in 1997, she moved with her mother into a four-bedroom house in Malibu Canyon, [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and her mother became her manager.

In 1998, she co-starred with [[Peter Fonda]] in a re-working of the classic [[Shakespearian]] play ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'', set during the [[American Civil War]]. Later that year, she starred in the horror film ''[[Bride of Chucky]]''.

===Rise to fame, 1999&ndash;2004===
In 1999, Heigl turned her attention to television when she accepted the role of [[Isabel Evans]] on the [[science fiction]] TV [[drama]] ''[[Roswell (TV series)|Roswell]]'', a role that was expanded in the show's second and third seasons. Heigl had auditioned for all three of the show's female leads (the other two roles eventually went to [[Shiri Appleby]] and [[Majandra Delfino]]) before she was finally cast as alien-human hybrid Isabel.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tribute.ca/people/Katherine+Heigl/2182/15504 | title=Katherine Heigl bio | accessdate=2007-12-27 | work=tribute.ca}}</ref>

Heigl was frequently featured in photo essays in magazines such as ''[[Life magazine|Life]]'', ''[[TV Guide]]'', and ''[[Teen (magazine)|Teen]]'' as well as ''[[FHM]]''. She appeared in the ''FHM'' and ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' calendars, ''FHM'''s annual "100 Sexiest Women in the World", and was featured in the Girls of Maxim Gallery.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.maximonline.com/girls_of_maxim/pictures_and_bio/268/KatherineHeigl.girl?src
| title=Girls of Maxim: Katherine Heigl | accessdate=2007-09-17 | work=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] star of Knocked Up}}</ref> In May 2006, ''Maxim'' awarded her #12 on their annual Hot 100List as well as voted the 19th "Sexiest Woman in the World" by readers of ''FHM'' magazine. While ''Roswell'' was in production, Heigl worked on several films, including ''[[100 Girls]]'', an [[independent film|independent]] 2001 film, and ''[[Valentine (film)|Valentine]]'', a [[horror film]] starring [[David Boreanaz]] and [[Denise Richards]].<ref>{{cite web

Heigl accepted a role in ''Ground Zero'', a television thriller scheduled to be telecast that fall which was based on the bestselling [[James Mills]] novel ''The Seventh Power'', in the spring of 2001. She co-starred as a brilliant and politically-concerned college student who helps to build a nuclear device to illustrate the need for a change in national priorities. The device ends up in the hands of a terrorist following betrayal by a fellow student. However, after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]], the film was shelved when its plot was considered inappropriate. It reemerged in 2003 under the title ''Critical Assembly''. After the attacks, Heigl recorded a [[public service announcement]] for the [[American Red Cross]] in an effort to help raise money for victims.

In 2003, Heigl appeared in three [[television movies]]. She returned to the horror genre with ''Evil Never Dies'', a modern-day variation on the ''[[Frankenstein]]'' story co-starring [[Thomas Gibson]]. ''[[Love Comes Softly]]'', for [[RHI Entertainment|Hallmark Entertainment]], found Heigl starring as Marty Claridge, a young, [[pregnant]] newlywed traveling west. (She reprised the role of Marty in the sequel ''[[Love's Enduring Promise]]'' the next year.) Heigl played Isabella Linton in [[MTV]]'s modern revamp of [[Emily Bront<U+00EB>]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''. In October 2003, Heigl was cast opposite [[Johnny Knoxville]] in ''[[The Ringer (2005 film)|The Ringer]]'', a [[Farrelly brothers]] comedy that was released in December 2005. Heigl starred as Romy in the 2005 [[television movie]] ''[[Romy and Michele: In the Beginning]]'', a [[prequel]] to the 1997 film ''[[Romy and Michele's High School Reunion]]''.

===Breakthrough, 2005&ndash;present===
In 2005, Heigl was cast in what would become her most high-profile role to date, as medical intern [[Izzie Stevens|Dr. Isobel "Izzie" Stevens]] on ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] medical drama. The show, originally introduced as a mid-season replacement, became a huge ratings success and is still one of the highest-rated television series on broadcast television. The same year, Heigl landed the starring role in the independent film, ''[[Side Effects (film)|Side Effects]]'',<ref>{{imdb title|0438427|Side Effects}}</ref> a romantic comedy about marketing and the pharmaceutical industry, which she also executive produced. In late 2006, Heigl was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] award in the category Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Mini-series, or Motion Picture Made for Television for her work on ''Grey's Anatomy''. Also in 2006, she filmed ''[[Knocked Up]]'', a comedy from writer/director [[Judd Apatow]], starring opposite [[Seth Rogen]], [[Paul Rudd]], and Apatow's real life wife, [[Leslie Mann]]. Upon its June 2007 theatrical release, the film received largely positive reviews from critics, and proved to be a [[box office]] success. Despite her run of success, she also starred in the [[box office bomb]] ''[[Zyzzyx Road]]'' which despite being filmed in 2004, was not released until 2006. It has been cited as the lowest grossing film of all time. She has been on ''[[FHM]]'''s "100 Sexiest Women in the World" list twice as of 2007.

[[File:Emmys-heigl.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Heigl at the 59th Annual Emmy Awards in 2007]]

On September 16, 2007, Heigl won an [[59th Primetime Emmy Awards|Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] for her role as Izzie Stevens. In her acceptance speech she acknowledged that even her mother did not believe she would win, and when her name was called, she had to be [[censorship|censored]] vocally by the telecast's producers, due to her saying "Shit!" when she reacted to the win.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/arts/television/18emmy.html|title= Fox Explains Censorship of Actors at Emmys |accessdate=2008-10-20|author= Edward Wyatt|date= 2007-09-17|work= [[New York Times]] |location=LOS ANGELES}}</ref> Earlier, she had corrected telecast announcer Rebecca Riedy, who had been given an incorrect phonetic spelling of Heigl's name, when she mispronounced her name as ''Hi-jell'' before the presentation of the award with [[Kyle Chandler]] for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie. She starred in the film, ''[[27 Dresses]]'' which was released in January 2008, playing alongside [[James Marsden]].

Katherine Heigl was announced the ''Most Desirable Woman of 2008'', according to [[AskMen.com]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.askmen.com/specials/2008_top_99/katherine-heigl-1-1.html|title= Top 99 Women 2008 Edition: Katherine Heigl|accessdate= 2008-02-03|work= [[AskMen.com]]}}</ref>

There was some speculation that Heigl might be leaving ''Grey's Anatomy'' after the end of the 2008-2009 season. This speculation revolved around her refusal to put her name in for [[Emmy Award]] consideration and the time she had devoted to producing a film version of [[Carolyn Jessop]]'s book ''[[Escape (Carolyn Jessop and Laura Palmer book)|Escape]]''.<ref>[http://thecelebritycafe.com/features/16924.html Heigl Checking Out of "Grey's Anatomy"?], ''The Celebrity Cafe'', June 14, 2008</ref><ref>[http://defamer.com/398420/greys-anatomy-has-exciting-arc-planned-for-katherine-heigl-in-which-she-drops-dead "Grey's Anatomy" Has Exciting Arc Planned for Katherine Heigl in Which She Drops Dead], ''Defamer.com'', July 11, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/rhimes%20no%20plan%20to%20kill%20off%20izzie_1074120 Rhimes: No Plan to Kill Off Izzie], ''ContactMusic.com'', July 12, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.nypost.com/seven/07142008/tv/killing_off_heigl_119880.htm Katherine Heigl On Her Way Out From "Grey's Anatomy"], ''New York Post'', July 14, 2008</ref> ''Grey's'' showrunner [[Shonda Rhimes]] said she was not insulted by Heigl's Emmy withdrawal, but also noted that Heigl's character Izzy had less to do during the season because Heigl asked for a light work schedule.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thrfeed.com/2008/07/rhimes-heigl-as.html|title=Rhimes: Heigl asked for light schedule|work= The Live Feed}}</ref> However, despite Heigl's reported displeasure with the previous season as well as suggestions that her character had died, Heigl's return for the sixth season of ''Grey's'' has been confirmed by ABC.<ref>

In 2009, Heigl starred opposite [[Gerard Butler]] in ''[[The Ugly Truth (film)|The Ugly Truth]]'', which opened July 24.<ref>{{cite news | author=Matt Mitovich| title=Will Big-Screen Life Interrupt Katherine Heigl's Grey's Shift? | url=http://movies.tvguide.com/Movie-News/Heigl-Berlanti-Life-1007216.aspx | work=JewishJournal | date=25 June 2009 | accessdate=2009-06-25}}</ref>

Heigl starred in the Lionsgate comedy-thriller ''[[Killers (2010 film)|Killers]]'', opposite [[Ashton Kutcher]], which was released June 4, 2010. She next starred in and produced the big-screen drama ''[[Life as We Know It (film)|Life As We Know It]]''. The film revolved around a woman and a man whose respective best friends die in a car accident; following the tragedy, they are left to share in caring for the deceased's orphaned daughter. ''[[Everwood]]'' creator [[Greg Berlanti]] directed the film.

Whether or not Heigl would leave ''Grey's Anatomy'' remained to be seen for the bigger part of season six.<ref>[http://tvwatch.people.com/2010/02/23/is-katherine-heigl-leaving-greys-anatomy Is Katherine Heigl Leaving "Grey's Anatomy"?], ''People.com'', February 23, 2010</ref> However, on March 11, 2010, Heigl reportedly did not show up for work when she was supposed to, and she and [[Shonda Rhimes]] had apparently come to an agreement to release her from her contract immediately. Therefore, Heigl's last appearance on the January 21 episode of ''Grey's Anatomy'' is also her final appearance on the season. Heigl said that her departure was not about advancing her film career but that she wanted to focus more on her family.<ref name=grey>[http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2010/03/11/greys-anatomy-katherine-heigl-leaving "Grey's Anatomy" Exclusive: Katherine Heigl is (Almost) Outta There!], ''Entertainment Weekly'', March 11, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b171689_sources_confirm_katherine_heigl_leaving.html Sources Confirm: Katherine Heigl is Leaving "Grey's Anatomy"], ''E!

In a highly-publicized ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' interview, as one of the lead actors in the hit film ''[[Knocked Up]]'', Heigl admitted that though she enjoyed working with Apatow and Rogen, she had a hard time enjoying the film itself. She called the movie "a little sexist", claiming that the film "paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys".<ref>{{cite press release | title=Katherine Heigl Talks About Marriage, Ratings Ploys, and Why She Thinks Knocked Up Is Sexist | publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | date=December 3, 2007 | url=http://www.vanityfair.com/services/presscenter/pressrelease/katherine_heigl200801

Heigl's comments spurred widespread reaction in the media, primarily consisting of personal attacks in which she was called "an ungrateful traitor", "hypocrite", and "assertive, impatient go-getter who quickly tired of waiting for her boyfriend to propose", in some cases debasing her religious beliefs and criticizing her private relationships.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/12/03/katherine-heigl-on-how-k_n_75086.html | title=Katherine Heigl On How "Knocked Up" Is Sexist, Ratings Ploys And Mormonism? | accessdate=2007-12-30 | work=The Huffington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.themovieblog.com/2007/12/calm-down-katherine-heigl-did-not-slam-knocked-up|title=CALM DOWN! Katherine Heigl Did Not <U+201C>Slam<U+201D> Knocked Up | accessdate=2007-12-30 | work=The Movie Blog}}</ref> Heigl clarified her remarks to ''[[People Magazine|People]]'' magazine, stating that, "My motive was to encourage other women like myself to not take that element of the movie too seriously and to remember that it's a broad comedy", adding that, "Although I stand behind my opinion, I'm disheartened that it has become the focus of my experience with the movie".<ref>{{cite web|title=Katherine Heigl Clarifies Knocked Up Remarks| work=[[People Magazine]] | date=December 7, 2007|url=http://www.themovieblog.com/2007/12/calm-down-katherine-heigl-did-not-slam-knocked-up|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref>

''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that Heigl's comments "provoked quite a backlash, and Heigl was described as ungrateful and a traitor. Some people even suggested she would never work again", remarks which in retrospect were not only proved demonstrably wrong but the publicity and promotion in the wake of her comments may well have propelled Heigl's career.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/mar/19/1 | title=Joker in the Pack | accessdate=2008-04-09 | date=2008-03-08 | work=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=Emine | last=Saner}}</ref>

Following the release of ''[[27 Dresses]]'', the ''[[New York Post]]'' expressed some disappointment with the mismatch of Heigl's talent with the "chick-flick" triviality of the film, suggesting that Heigl might be more compatible "with female directors such as Kimberly Peirce (''Boys Don't Cry'') or Tamara Jenkins (''The Savages'')...".<ref>{{cite news | title=For Better or Worse, Katherine Heigl is a Chick-Flick Advocate | work=The New York Post | date=18 January 2008 | url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/01132008/entertainment/movies/_27_dresses__477685.htm | first=Sara | last=Stewart}}</ref>

==Animal welfare projects==
Heigl has worked with [[Best Friends Animal Society]] on several projects including their Pup My Ride program.  The program transports small dogs from high-kill [[animal shelter]]s to other parts of the US where there is a greater demand for such dogs.  Her involvement in this led her to give Best Friends a grant which would fund a year of the program.<ref name=bestfriends>{{cite journal |year=2009 |title=Anatomy of an Animal Lover |journal=Best Friends Magazine |volume=18 |issue=6 |page=72 |url=http://www.bestfriends.org }}</ref>

Heigl and her mother, Nancy, then started Heigl's Hounds of Hope which operates as part of the Jason Debus Heigl Foundation.  The Foundation was created in honor of Katherine's brother, who was killed in a car accident in 1986 at the age of fifteen.  Heigl's Hounds of Hope rescues larger dogs with behavior problems from shelters with a high kill rate and rehabilitates them through training and other adjustments to make them suitable for re-homing.<ref name=bestfriends />

As of 2009, Heigl had six dogs of her own.<ref name=bestfriends />

==Personal life==

In June 2006, she became engaged to singer [[Josh Kelley]], whom she met on the set of his music video for "Only You".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1205213,00.html?cid=redirect-articles | title=Grey's Anatomy Star Katherine Heigl Engaged | accessdate=2007-09-17 | date=2006-06-16 | work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}</ref> They were married on December 23, 2007 in [[Park City, Utah]]. During a taping of ''[[Live With Regis and Kelly]]'', Heigl stated that she and Kelley chose not to live together before they were married, saying, "I think I just wanted to save something for the actual marriage... I wanted there to be something to make the actual marriage different than the dating or the courtship."<ref>{{cite web|date=March 24, 2008 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKSFITZsuTs |title=Katherine Heigl live with Regis and Kelly&nbsp;<U+2014> part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-03-24 |accessdate=2009-08-14}}</ref> Her brother-in-law is [[Charles Kelley]], of the [[Grammy Award]] winning [[country music]] trio [[Lady Antebellum]]

On September 9, 2009, Heigl's representative confirmed that the couple had started the process of adopting a baby girl from South Korea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20303399,00.html|title=Katherine Heigl & Husband Adopting a Girl|last=Fleeman|first=Mike |coauthors=Ingrassia, Lisa|date=2009-09-09|publisher=people.com}}</ref> Later that month, the couple adopted a baby girl with [[special needs]] they named Nancy Leigh (named after Heigl's mother and sister), nicknamed Naleigh.  Heigl's sister is also Korean-born and was adopted before Heigl was born.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ingrassia|first=Lisa|date=2009-09-05|title=Katherine Heigl's Baby Joy|journal=People|volume=75|issue=14|pages=73|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20314180,00.html}}</ref>
