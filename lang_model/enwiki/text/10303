'''Parrotfish'''  are mostly tropical, [[perciform]] marine [[fish]] of the family '''Scaridae'''. Abundant on shallow [[reef]]s of the [[Red Sea]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s, the parrotfish family contains ten genera and about 90 species.

==Characteristics==

[[File:Parrotfish_turquoisse.jpg|thumb|left|Parrotfish from North coast [[East Timor]]<U+200E>.]]Parrotfish are named for their dentition; their numerous teeth are arranged in a tightly packed mosaic on the external surface of the jaw bones, forming a [[parrot]]-like beak which is used to rasp [[algae]] from coral and other rocky substrates<ref name=EoF>{{cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R. & Eschmeyer, W.N.|author= Choat, J.H. & Bellwood, D.R.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 209<U+2013>211|isbn= 0-12-547665-5}}</ref> (a process called [[bioerosion]]). Many species are also brightly coloured in shades of blue, green, red and yellow, but are not especially popular in [[aquaria]]. 

Although they are considered to be [[herbivore]]s, parrotfish eat a wide variety of organisms that live on coral reefs. Some species, for example ''[[Bolbometopon muricatum]]'' may include [[coral]]s ([[polyp]]s) in their diet.<ref name=EoF/> Their feeding activity is important for the production and distribution of coral sands in the reef [[biome]] and can prevent algae from choking coral. The teeth grow continuously, making it hard to curb overgrowth in the aquarium. Ingested during feeding, coral rock is ground up by the [[pharyngeal teeth]]. After they digest this it is excreted as sand thus at times creating small islands and the idyllic sandy beaches of the bahamas and caribbean.

Maximum sizes do not vary widely within the family, with the majority of species reaching {{convert|30|cm|in}} to {{convert|40|cm|in}} in length. However, a very few species, such as the the [[bumphead parrotfish]] (''Bolbometopon muricatum''), are much larger, up to {{convert|100|cm|in}}.<ref name=EoF/>

Their bodies are deep, with large, thick [[cycloid]] scales, large pectoral fins and homocercal tail fins. The pectorals are the parrotfish's primary means of locomotion, the tail only used when speed is required. Some parrotfish females can turn into male parrotfish.

==Life cycle==
[[Image:Bicolor parrotfish.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Bicolor parrotfish (''Cetoscarus bicolor'')]]
The development of parrotfishes is complex and accompanied by a series of changes in coloration termed polychromatism. For most species, adult males and females have different colours, the females usually displaying drab tones of green, brown or grey, and the males  vivid, conspicuous colours. In the [[Mediterranean parrotfish]] (''Sparisoma cretense''), it is the females that have vivid coloration with the males being drab grey. 

In most species, the juveniles have a different colour pattern than the adults and some tropical species this juvenile coloration can be altered temporarily to mimic the appearance of other species. As the juveniles mature they enter what is termed the ''initial phase'' coloration during which they may change colour and sex. For most species, initial phase fishes are usually males that have the beginnings of the adult male coloration. However, initial phase fishes may include sexually mature females. The high variability in coloration of parrotfish has led to the different phases of many species being erroneously classified as different species in the past. [[File:Parrotfish_Timor.jpg<U+200E>|thumb|right|Parrotfish sleeping in a nook on a rock wall. ]]Coloration is highly variable even among members of the same species. This "identity crisis" is shared by their close relatives, the [[wrasse]]s of the family Labridae.

Grazing parrotfish of most tropical species form large schools grouped by size. Harems of several females presided over by a single male are the norm in other species, the males vigorously defending their status at any challenge. If the dominant male of a harem is removed, one of the females will change sex and adopt the terminal male coloration. 

Parrotfish are pelagic spawners; that is, they release many tiny buoyant eggs into the water which become part of the [[plankton]]. The eggs float freely, settling into the substrate until hatching.

==Economic importance==

A commercial [[fishery]] exists for some of the larger tropical species. Their meat is rarely consumed in the US; however, it is considered a delicacy in many other parts of the world. 

Protecting parrotfish is proposed as a way of saving Caribbean coral reefs from being overgrown with seaweed..<ref>BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7069933.stm Parrotfish to aid reef repair] [[1 November]] 2007</ref>
