'''Geoffrey A. Landis''' (born May 28, 1955, [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]) is an [[United States|American]] scientist, working for the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) on [[planetary exploration]], [[interstellar propulsion]], [[solar power]] and [[photovoltaics]]. He has patented eight designs for solar cells and photovoltaic devices and has given presentations and commentary on the possibilities for interstellar travel and construction of bases on the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]].

Landis is also a notable writer of scientifically accurate and detailed [[hard science fiction]], and has won one [[Nebula Award]], two [[Hugo Awards]], a [[Locus Award]] for his fiction writing, and two [[Rhysling Awards]] for his poetry. He contributes science fact articles to a number of publications. Landis is married to science fiction writer and poet [[Mary A. Turzillo]] and lives in [[Berea, Ohio]].

In 2002 Landis addressed the annual convention of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] on the possibilities and challenges of interstellar travel in what was described as the "first serious discussion of how mankind will one day set sail to the nearest star". Dr. Landis said, "This is the first meeting to really consider interstellar travel by humans. It is historic. We're going to the stars. There really isn't a choice in the long term.". He went on to describe a star ship with a diamond sail, a few [[nanometres]] thick, powered by solar energy, which could achieve "10 per cent of the speed of light".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1385077/Reach-for-the-stars-on-a-beam-of-light.html
