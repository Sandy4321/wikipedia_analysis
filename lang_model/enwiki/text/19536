'''Piedmont''' is a plateau region located in the eastern [[United States]] between the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]] and the main [[Appalachian Mountains]], stretching from [[New Jersey]] in the north to central [[Alabama]] in the south. The '''Piedmont province''' is a [[Physiographic regions of the world|physiographic province]] of the larger [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] division. The province consists of the [[Piedmont Upland]] and [[Piedmont Lowlands]] sections. The [[Fall line]] marks its eastern boundary with the Coastal Plain. To the west, the Piedmont is mostly bounded by the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], the easternmost range of the main Appalachians.  Physiographically, the Piedmont is considered a province of the larger Appalachian Highlands physiographic division.<ref name="USGS-Water">{{cite web |title=Physiographic divisions of the conterminous U.

The name "Piedmont" roughly translates as foot (pied) hill (mont) in French, and the region is named after the Italian region of [[Piemonte]]. 

==Geology==
The surface relief of the Piedmont is characterized by relatively low, rolling hills with heights above [[sea level]] between 200 feet (50 m) and 800 feet to 1,000 feet (250 m to 300 m). Its [[geology]] is complex, with numerous rock formations of different materials and ages intermingled with one another. Essentially, the Piedmont is the remnant of several ancient [[Mountain range|mountain chains]] that have since been eroded away. Geologists have identified at least five separate events which have led to [[sediment]] deposition, including the [[Grenville orogeny]] (the collision of continents that created the [[supercontinent]] [[Rodinia]]) and the [[Appalachian orogeny]] during the formation of [[Pangaea]]. The last major event in the history of the Piedmont was the break-up of Pangaea, when [[North America]] and [[Africa]] began to separate. Large [[sedimentary basin|basins]] formed from the [[rift]]ing and were subsequently filled by the sediments shed from the surrounding higher ground. The series of [[Mesozoic]] basins is almost entirely located within the Piedmont region.

==Soils and farming==
Piedmont soils are generally [[clay]]-like and moderately fertile. In some areas they have suffered from [[erosion]] and over-cropping, particularly in the South where [[cotton]] was historically the chief crop. In the central Piedmont region of North Carolina and [[Virginia]], [[tobacco]] is the main crop, while in the north there is more diversity, including [[orchard]]s, [[dairy]]ing, and general [[farm]]ing.<ref name="gazetteer"/>  The northern end of the piedmont has some of the most fertile soils.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Music==
The Piedmont region is closely associated with the [[Piedmont blues]], a style of [[blues]] music that originated there in the late 19th century. Most Piedmont blues musicians came from Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. During the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], Black Americans migrated to the Piedmont. With the Appalachian Mountains to the west, those who might otherwise have spread into rural areas  stayed in cities and were thus exposed to a broader mixture of music than those in, for example, the rural Mississippi delta. Thus, [[Piedmont blues]] was influenced by many types of music such as ragtime, country, and popular songs<U+2014>styles that had comparatively less influence on blues music in other regions.

==Cities==
Many major cities are located on the [[Fall line]], the eastern boundary of the Piedmont. Within the Piedmont region itself there are several areas of urban concentration. For example, the [[Piedmont Crescent]] in North Carolina includes several metropolitan clusters such as [[Charlotte metropolitan area|Metrolina (Charlotte)]], the [[Piedmont Triad]], and [[The Triangle (North Carolina)|The Triangle]]. Another major city of the Piedmont is [[Atlanta, Georgia]].
