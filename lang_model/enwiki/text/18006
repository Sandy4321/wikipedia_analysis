==Biography==
She was born in [[Sevastopol]], [[Ukraine]], then part of the [[Soviet Union]], as {{lang-ru|<U+0413><U+0430><U+043B><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430> <U+041D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+0430><U+0435><U+0432><U+043D><U+0430> <U+041F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0437><U+0443><U+043C><U+0435><U+043D><U+0449><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430>}} ({{lang-uk|<U+0413><U+0430><U+043B><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430> <U+041C><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+0430><U+0457><U+0432><U+043D><U+0430> <U+041F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0437><U+0443><U+043C><U+0435><U+043D><U+0449><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430>}}). Because of the differences in transliterations from Russian and Ukrainian and the lack of established transliteration rules for these languages, her name is variably written as Galina/Halyna Nikolayevna/Nikolaevna/Mikolaivna Prozumenshchikova/Prozumenschikova/Prozumenchikova, and the middle name is usually omitted. She married twice and therefore changed her last name first to Stepanova ({{lang-ru|<U+0421><U+0442><U+0435><U+043F><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430>}})<ref name=r3/> and then to Ivannikova ({{lang-ru|<U+0418><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430>}}). 

Her father, Nikolai Nikolayevich ({{lang-ru|<U+041D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+0430><U+0439> <U+041D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+0430><U+0435><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447>}}; 1913<U+2013>1991) was a [[submarine]] captain.<ref name=r2/> Mother, Sofia Petrovna ({{lang-ru|<U+0421><U+043E><U+0444><U+044C><U+044F> <U+041F><U+0435><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+043D><U+0430>}}; 1922<U+2013>1987) was a nurse and took part in World War II. Galina started swimming in a club in 1959 and until 1966 competed for SKF Sevastopol. By the time of her first Olympics in 1964 she was won several national and international competitions and set national and world records in the 200 m breaststroke. (Her favorite discipline was 100 m breaststroke, but it became an Olympic event only in 1968.<ref name=r3/>) However, she was operated for [[Appendectomy|appendicitis]] in July, just before the games, and was not in her top form. She also had a strong rival, [[Svetlana Babanina]], who set a world record in the 100 m breaststroke before the 1964 Olympics. Nevertheless, Prozumenshchikova won the 200 m event, setting a new Olympic record<ref name=r2/> and winning the first Soviet Olympic gold in swimming. Babanina finished third.<ref name=r1/> 

In 1966, Prozumenshchikova enrolled to the faculty of journalism of the [[Moscow State University]] (MSU) and since then lived in Moscow.<ref name=r3/> In 1969 she gave birth to a daughter, Irina ({{lang-ru|<U+0418><U+0440><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0412><U+043B><U+0430><U+0434><U+0438><U+043C><U+0438><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0421><U+0442><U+0435><U+043F><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430>}}), and was on the verge of retiring. However, she returned to competitions in 1970 and retired only in 1973. She graduated from MSU in 1976 and was writing sports columns for the major newspaper ''[[Izvestia]]''. However, she soon left journalism,<ref name=r3/> and between 1976 and 1980 worked as a sports functionary, and after 1980 as a swimming coach for children at [[CSKA]].<ref name=r1/> 

In the 1970s she remarried, to Yuri Ivanovich Ivannikov ({{lang-ru|<U+042E><U+0440><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0418><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+0418><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432>}}; born 1950), an economist.
