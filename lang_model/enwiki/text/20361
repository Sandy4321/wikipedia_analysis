'''Michael Keller Ditka''' (born '''Michael Dyczko''' on October 18, 1939) is a former [[American football]] player, coach, and television commentator, and coach. Ditka coached the [[Chicago Bears]] for 11 years and [[New Orleans Saints]] for three years. Ditka and [[Tom Flores]] are the only two people to win an NFL title as a player, an assistant coach, and a head coach.<!-- Please do not edit [[Tony Dungy]] here. He did not win a Super Bowl as an assistant coach.

==Early life and college career==
Ditka was born as Michael Dyczko in the [[Pittsburgh]]-area town of [[Carnegie, Pennsylvania]] on October 18, 1939. The oldest child of Mike Sr. and Charlotte, he grew up in nearby [[Aliquippa, Pennsylvania]]{{r|price20110131}} with siblings Ashton, David, and Mary Ann. Mike Sr., a welder, was one of three brothers of a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/tradition/hof-ditka.asp |title=Mike Ditka page on |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-01}} Quote from article: "Mike's childhood name was Mike Dyzcko. His father was one of three brothers of a Ukrainian family in the coal mining and steel manufacturing area in Western Pennsylvania"</ref> family in the coal mining and steel manufacturing area in Western Pennsylvania. The surname "Dyczko" was difficult to pronounce in his hometown, so the family name was changed to "Ditka."<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Ditka attended St. Titus School.

A three-sport star at [[Aliquippa High School]], Ditka hoped to escape his hometown's manufacturing jobs by attending college with a football scholarship. Planning to become a dentist,<ref name=price20110131>{{cite news|last=Price|first=S.L.|title=The Heart Of Football Beats In Aliquippa|url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?expire=&title=Over+five+decades+of+economic+decline+and+racial+conflict,+-+01.31.11+-+SI+Vault&urlID=445388322&action=cpt&partnerID=289881&fb=Y&url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1181210/index.htm|accessdate=2011-02-06|newspaper=Sports Illustrated|date=2011-01-31}}</ref> he was recruited by [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], [[Penn State]], and [[University of Pittsburgh]]. Ditka played for the [[University of Pittsburgh]] from 1958<U+2013>1960, where he also became a member of the [[Sigma Chi]] Fraternity. He started all three seasons and is widely considered one of the best [[tight end]]s in college football history. In addition to playing tight end, he also served as the team's punter.  He led the team in receiving in all three of his seasons with them and was a first team selection on the [[College Football All-America Team]] in his senior year. In 1986, he was enshrined in the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].

He has four children with his first wife Marge.  He and Marge divorced in 1973, and he married his second wife Diana in 1977.

==Playing career==
===Chicago Bears===
The [[Chicago Bears]] drafted Ditka fifth overall in the [[1961 NFL Draft]], while the Houston Oilers drafted him eighth overall in the first round in the [[1961 AFL Draft]].  He signed with the Bears and his presence was immediately felt. In his first season, Ditka had 58 receptions, introducing a new dimension to a tight end position that had previously been dedicated to blocking. His success earned him [[UPI NFL-NFC Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] honors. He continued to play for the Bears for the next five years, earning a [[Pro Bowl]] trip each season. He played on the [[1963 NFL season|1963]] NFL championship team. Many of the players from that team, including Ditka, were drafted by assistant coach [[George Allen (football)|George Allen]], a future Hall of Famer, who was then in charge of the Bears drafts. Ditka ranks first among tight ends and fourth in Bears history with 4,503 yards, fifth in both receptions (316) and touchdown catches (34).<ref name="Number retired" />

The Bears announced on May 24, 2013 that they will retire Ditka's number 89 jersey on December 9, 2013.<ref name="Number retired" /> The number will be the final number retired by the Bears.<ref>{{cite web|last=Katzowitz|first=Josh|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/blog/eye-on-football/22306963/mike-ditkas-retired-jersey-will-be-the-last-for-the-bears|title=Mike Ditka's retired jersey will be the last for the Bears|publisher=[[CBS Sports]]|date=2013-05-26|accessdate=2013-07-30}}</ref>

===Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys===
Ditka was traded to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in [[1967 NFL season|1967]], where he spent two seasons, before being shipped off to the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in [[1969 NFL season|1969]]. He spent four seasons with the Cowboys, highlighted by a touchdown reception in the Cowboys' 24&ndash;3 victory over the [[Miami Dolphins]] in [[Super Bowl VI]].

===Hall of Fame enshrinement===
In [[1988 NFL season|1988]],<ref>[http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/years.html years - Pro Football Hall of Fame]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> his fearsome blocking and 427 career receptions for 5,812 yards and 43 touchdowns earned him the honor of being the first tight end ever inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].<ref name="Number retired" /> Ditka also scored two touchdowns on offensive fumble recoveries, tying seven other players for the most in NFL history. In [[1999 NFL season|1999]], he was ranked number 90 on ''[[The Sporting News]]'''s list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.

==Coaching career==
Retiring after the [[1972 NFL season|1972]] season, Ditka was immediately hired as an assistant coach by Cowboys' head coach [[Tom Landry]]. Ditka spent nine seasons as an assistant coach with the Cowboys. During his tenure, the Cowboys made the playoffs eight times, won six division titles and three NFC Championships, including the one preceding their [[Super Bowl XII|Super Bowl victory]] in [[1977 NFL season|1977]].

While working with the Cowboys, Ditka sent a letter to [[George Halas]], his former head coach who was still owner of the Chicago Bears. In the letter Ditka said that he would like to come back to Chicago and be the head coach of the Bears "when he was ready".<ref name="America's Game">''[[America's Game: The Super Bowl Champions]]'', "#2. 1985 Chicago Bears." Premiered on [[CBS]], Feb. 3, 2007</ref> Meanwhile, the Cowboys continued to win games although they did not win another Super Bowl while Ditka was there. His last game with the Cowboys was the 1981 NFC Championship Game, where the team fell to the [[San Francisco 49ers]].

===Chicago Bears===
After firing previous coach [[Neill Armstrong]] following the [[1981 NFL season|1981 season]], Halas decided to take Ditka up on his offer from several years earlier and hired him to become the team's head coach for [[1982 Chicago Bears season|1982 campaign]]. Although the Bears had made the playoffs under Armstrong and his predecessor [[Jack Pardee]], those were the only two winning seasons since Halas' retirement as coach and he was looking for a coach who would bring the Bears back to prominence. Shortly after his hiring, as recounted by Mike Singletary in 2006, Ditka called a team meeting. In the meeting he warned that the team would experience some turnover, but if they were all willing to work hard for him and stand with him, Ditka promised a trip to the Super Bowl within three seasons.<ref name="America's Game" />

By his third season Ditka led the Bears to the [[NFC Championship Game]], where the Bears were shut out by the eventual Super Bowl winning 49ers in San Francisco. The following year Ditka's coaching career hit its pinnacle on January 26, 1986 with a 46&ndash;10 trouncing of the [[New England Patriots]] in [[Super Bowl XX]] at the [[Louisiana Superdome]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. Ditka has stated that one of his biggest regrets in life was not letting [[Walter Payton]] score a touchdown in the Super Bowl, instead opting for [[Jim McMahon]] to run it in twice and rookie defensive tackle [[William "The Refrigerator" Perry]] to run it in once.

Football commentators widely regard the 1985 Bears defense as one of the best ever. It was masterminded by defensive coordinator [[Buddy Ryan]], with little oversight from Ditka; in fact, Ditka and Ryan had a largely adversarial relationship dating back to Ditka's hire. In fact, the relationship was so contentious that the two came to blows at halftime of what would be the Bears' only loss of the 1985 season against the [[Miami Dolphins]]. In an unusual gesture, following the Bears Super Bowl victory, the players carried both Ryan and Ditka off the field. In addition, the 1985 Chicago Bears are one of the few teams who consistently challenge the undefeated [[1972 NFL Season|1972]] [[Miami Dolphins]] for the unofficial title of the "Greatest NFL Team of All-Time." <ref name="Greatest NFL Teams of All Time">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/football/teams/greatest.html |title=Greatest NFL Teams of All Time |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2002-08-14 |accessdate=2011-09-01}}</ref> The NFL Network [[America's Game]] rated the 1985 Bears as the second best Super Bowl champions ever.

Buddy Ryan left in 1986 to become the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles.  When asked if he was happy Ryan was gone, Ditka replied he was not happy but "elated." In 1986, 1987 and 1988, the Bears won the Central Division title and earned three home playoff games. The first of those years saw the Bears finish the regular season with a 14-2 record to tie the [[New York Giants]] for the best in the entire league. However, the Bears were upset by the [[Washington Redskins]] in their first playoff game. The next year the Bears finished second in the NFC with an 11-4 record but were again upended by the Redskins en route to that team's second Super Bowl victory of the decade. The Bears finished 12-4 in 1988 and got homefield advantage, and defeated Ryan's Eagles in the [[Fog Bowl (American football)|Fog Bowl]] in their first game. However, the team was defeated by the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game and this would be the last time the team would advance that far until they won the 2006 NFC Championship Game.

Ditka suffered a heart attack during the 1988 season and was expected to miss much of the season, but was on the sidelines as an "advisor" the next week and back in full charge the week after.

The Bears started 4&ndash;0 in 1989, but a series of last-second losses eventually led to a complete meltdown at the end of the season as the Bears finished 6&ndash;10.  The Bears rallied to win a weak Central Division in 1990 and make the playoffs as a wild card in 1991, but were eliminated convincingly in the early rounds.  After dropping to 5&ndash;11 in the [[1992 NFL season|1992]] season, the Bears fired Ditka.  His 106 wins are the second-most in Bears history, behind only Halas.

He was awarded [[National Football League Coach of the Year Award|NFL Coach of the Year]] honors in [[1985 NFL season|1985]] and [[1988 NFL season|1988]]<ref name="Number retired" /> by the [[Associated Press]], [[The Sporting News]], and [[Pro Football Weekly]].

===New Orleans Saints===
In [[1997 NFL season|1997]], he returned to coach the [[New Orleans Saints]].  His three seasons there were nowhere near as successful as his tenure in Chicago; indeed, Ditka later referred to his tenure with the Saints as the "three worst years" of his life. 

Ditka was roundly criticized for the trading of all of the team's [[1999 NFL Draft|1999]] draft picks (plus their first round draft pick in [[2000 NFL Draft|2000]]) to the [[Washington Redskins]] in order to move up in the draft and select Texas RB [[Ricky Williams]] (Washington would later use the picks to select future Pro Bowlers [[Champ Bailey]], [[Jon Jansen]] and [[LaVar Arrington]]). The trade was further mocked because of a magazine cover in which Ditka posed with Williams, who was wearing a wedding dress.<ref name=NOLA041809>Bill Baker, [http://blog.nola.com/saintsbeat/2009/04/wedding_photo_of_mike_ditka_an.html 'Wedding photo' of Mike Ditka and Ricky Williams was worth a thousand], April 18, 2009, Accessed May 11, 2010.</ref> 

The drafting of Williams did not help the Saints' situation at all. In fact, the team regressed to a 3-13 mark in 1999. After a week 13 loss to the Atlanta Falcons to drop the Saints to 2-10, Ditka took the blame for the team's poor offensive performance thus far in the season and said that he was "probably the wrong guy for this job" and that the Saints would probably be better off hiring someone else. Ditka claimed he "didn't have it anymore", was thinking about leaving, and that "God puts people in places for reasons, and he probably put me here to be humbled. I deserve it." He claimed he had "failed" the team, and that he perhaps had changed too much as a coach. The Saints only won one more time the remainder of the year and Ditka, along with general manager [[Bill Kuharich]], lost his job at the end of the year. Despite the high expectations upon his hiring, Ditka's overall record with the Saints was 15&ndash;33. (By contrast his replacement, [[Jim Haslett]], took the Saints to a 10-6 record and a division title the next year with essentially the same team.)

Over a total of 14 seasons as a head coach, Ditka amassed a regular season record of 121&ndash;95 and a postseason record of 6&ndash;6.

===Incidents===
In [[1983 NFL season|1983]], Ditka broke his hand after punching a locker in an angry halftime tirade.<ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Roy|title=Mike Ditka Biography|url=http://www.bearshistory.com/lore/mikeditka.aspx|work=Chicago Bears History|publisher=bearshistory.com|accessdate=1/5/13}}</ref>  In [[1985 NFL season|1985]], he was arrested and convicted of [[Driving while intoxicated|DWI]] after returning from a game with San Francisco.<ref name="dwi">{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE6D7143AF936A25751C0A960948260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fD%2fDitka%2c%20Mike |title=Ditka's Defense Falters |publisher=New York Times |date=1986-02-15 |accessdate=2011-09-01}}</ref> In 1986, Ditka formed [[A-ok|a gesture]] with his hand and told a heckler, "See that?

While Ditka was with the Saints, an incident which has made the rounds on sports highlight shows featuring angry coach tirades took place during his last year. An angry Ditka, with his team sitting at 2-7, conducted an impromptu press briefing from a chair in front of the wall of the Saints' practice facility kept dismissing reporters' questions with short and curt answers and a sarcastic "next" when he wanted to change the subject. When asked why he was in such a bad mood, Ditka snapped at the reporter, "what do you care? If you were 2-7 you'd be in a bad mood too." He then cut the press conference short and stormed off.

On November 16, 2012, Ditka suffered a minor stroke at a suburban country club in Chicago. Later in the day, Ditka reported that he was feeling "good right now and it's not a big deal."

==Broadcasting career==
After his dismissal from the Bears in [[1992 NFL season|1992]], Ditka took a broadcasting job with [[NFL on NBC|NBC]], working as an analyst on ''[[The NFL on NBC Pregame Show#NFL Live|NFL Live]]'' and as a color commentator for many other NBC broadcasts. From the [[2000 NFL season|2000]] to the [[2001 NFL season|2001]] season he was a studio analyst on ''[[The NFL Today]]'' on [[CBS Sports]]. He is currently a commentator on [[ESPN]]'s ''NFL Live'', ESPN's ''[[Sunday NFL Countdown]]'', and [[CBS Radio]]-[[Westwood One]]'s ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' pregame show. On his radio show, Coach Ditka is called "America's Coach" by well known sidekick [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]]. Beginning in 2006 Ditka appeared on a Seattle radio program; "Groz with Gas" on 950 [[KJR-AM]] Seattle, on Thursday afternoons with Dave Grosby and Mike Gastineau. Ditka regularly appears on Chicago radio station ESPN 1000 ([[WMVP]]-AM), often broadcasting on Thursday mornings from one of his [[eponymous]] restaurants along with ESPN 1000 mid-morning hosts Marc Silverman and [[Tom Waddle]], a former Bears player under Ditka.

Ditka served as color commentator for [[ESPN]]'s September 10, 2007 broadcast of ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', alongside [[Mike Greenberg]] and [[Mike Golic]].<ref>{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Michael|title=ESPN tabs Greenberg, Golic to head second MNF team|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/mccarthy/2007-06-19-mccarthy-espn_N.htm|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=18 November 2012|date=June 20, 2007}}</ref>  He replicated this role on the second game of the doubleheader in 2008 as well.

==Other ventures==
In 1991, Ditka cooperated with [[Accolade (game company)|Accolade]] to produce the computer game ''[[Mike Ditka's Ultimate Football]]''. In 1995, Ditka starred as a football coach in a [[full motion video]] game called ''[[Quarterback Attack with Mike Ditka]]'', released for the [[Sega Saturn]], PC, and [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]].

Ditka performed "[[Take Me Out to the Ballgame]]" during a [[Chicago Cubs]] game at [[Wrigley Field]] in 1998, the first season after the death of [[Harry Caray]], who had previously led the song. ''Chicago Now'' blogger Marcus Leshock derided the performance, dubbing Ditka "the worst 7th-inning singer in history."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/leshock-value/2010/04/the-7-worst-7th-inning-stretch-performances-in-history.html |title=The 7 WORST 7th Inning Stretch Performances In History |publisher=Chicagonow.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-01}}</ref>

Ditka was inducted to the [[National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame]] in 2001.

Ditka has also done guest spots and cameos on shows from ''[[L.A. Law]]'' to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', and ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]''. In [[2005 in film|2005]], Ditka portrayed himself in the comedy ''[[Kicking & Screaming (2005 film)|Kicking & Screaming]]'' as a little league soccer coach, alongside [[Will Ferrell]].

In January 2007, Ditka used the Super Bowl return of the Chicago Bears as a platform to promote efforts by many early NFL players trying to raise support for former NFL players in need of money and medical assistance; he is a key member in the [[Gridiron Greats]]. Angry at the wealthy NFL for ignoring the players that helped to create the league, Ditka and other former players have since been attempting to raise funds, in the words of Hall of Famer [[Joe DeLamielleure]], "for guys who made this league and built it on their backs, their knees, their legs and now they're all broken down and they can't even get a decent pension."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sun-sentinel.com/sports_seasonticket/2007/02/retired_nfl_pla_1.html |title=Retired NFL Players |publisher=Blogs.sun-sentinel.com |date=2007-02-02 |accessdate=2011-09-01}}</ref> Ultimately, however, in December 2007, Ditka folded his "Hall of Fame Assistance Trust Fund" charity amidst revelations that, "in 2005 the group gave out more money to pay celebrities to play golf than the group in its entire three years of operation gave out to injured players," according to Laurie Styron of the American Institute of Philanthropy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/topstories/news-article.aspx?storyid=97946&ref=rss |title=Charity Run By NFL Legend Mike Ditka Folds |publisher=Firstcoastnews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-01}}</ref> During [[Super Bowl XLIV]], Ditka (who was not in the original group) joined other members of the 1985 Chicago Bears in resurrecting the [[Super Bowl Shuffle]] in a [[Boost Mobile]] commercial.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jon GreenbergColumnist, ESPNChicago.comFollowArchive |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/nfl/columns/story?columnist=greenberg_jon&id=4827883 |title=Chicago Bears' "Super Bowl Shuffle" an enduring, endearing sports moment - ESPN Chicago |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2010-01-15 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}</ref>

In the spring of 2007 Ditka worked alongside X Management and Geneva Hospitality to form Mike Ditka Resorts, currently consisting of two resorts in the [[Orlando, Florida]] area. Ditka owns a chain of restaurants, "Ditka's," which has two locations in Illinois, one in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and a new one in Phoneix, Arizona.<ref>[http://www.wingilariver.com/index.php/vq-vee-quiva-hotel-casino/dining/ditkas]</ref>

Ditka is a co-owner the [[Chicago Rush]], an [[Arena Football League (1987<U+2013>2008)|Arena Football League]] team. In August 2011, media reports noted that Ditka would be a financial investor for the new [[Elite Football League of India]], a proposed American football league that will be [[India|India's]] first.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/sns-ap-fbo-football-in-india,0,1978030.story |title=Football : Football News and Photos |publisher=chicagotribune.com |date=2011-08-28 |accessdate=2011-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Philadelphia Business Journal - by John George |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/blog/john-george/2011/08/cowboys-in-india-jaworski-helps.html |title=Ron Jaworski is investor in new India football league - Philadelphia Business Journal |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= 2011-08-03|accessdate=2011-09-01}}</ref>

In 2012, Ditka partnered with Terlato Wines to produce his own collection of wines, produced in California.<ref>http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20120827/BLOGS04/120829828/mike-ditka-relaunches-wine-line</ref>  The partnership stemmed from a 20-year friendship between Ditka and Bill Terlato and their shared love of sports and food and wine.  The first Mike Ditka Wines were released in fall 2012, including eight labels highlighting his career:  "The Player," (2011 Pinot Grigio and 2010 Merlot); "The Coach" (2011 Sauvignon Blanc and 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon); " The Hall of Famer" (2011 Chardonnay and 2011 Pinot Noir); and "The Restaurateur" pair which includes "The Icon" (2010 Cabernet Sauvignon) and "The Champion" (2010 Red Blend)."<ref>http://terlatowines.com/brands/california/mike-ditka-wines</ref> The same year, Ditka and Camacho cigars partnered and produced a line of cigars called <U+201C>The Mike Ditka <U+201C>Kickoff Series<U+201D>.<ref>http://www.cigaraficionado.com/webfeatures/show/id/16621</ref>  These cigars are named to highlight the milestones of Coach Ditka<U+2019>s football career:  <U+201C>The Player<U+201D>, The Coach<U+201D>, and <U+201C>The Hall of Famer<U+201D>.  All of these cigars are produced in Honduras.<ref>http://camachocigars.com/mike-ditka-collection/</ref>

In 2013, Ditka and [[Vienna Beef]] partnered to create Ditka Sausages, which will be eight inches long and 1/3 lb. There will be two types: "Hot Beef Polish Sausage" and "Chicken Sausage with Mozzarella and Sun-Dried Tomatoes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/vienna-beef-coach-mike-ditka-190000584.html|title=Vienna Beef and Coach Mike Ditka Partner to Launch Ditka Sausages|work=[[Yahoo!

==Politics==
In July 2004, Ditka, a self-described "ultra-ultra-ultra conservative",<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnist/wickham/2004-07-19-wickham_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=GOP's morality drive hits potholes | date=July 19, 2004 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> was reportedly considering running against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Barack Obama]] for an open seat in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] for [[Illinois]] in the [[U.S. Senate elections, 2004|2004 Senate election]].  The seat was being vacated by [[Peter Fitzgerald (senator)|Peter Fitzgerald]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and Republican nominee [[Jack Ryan (Senate candidate)|Jack Ryan]] withdrew from the race amid controversy at the end of June, leaving the Republicans in a bind. Local and national political leaders, from Illinois Republican Party Chair [[Judy Baar Topinka]] to National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair [[George Felix Allen|Sen. George Allen]], whose [[George Allen (football)|father by the same name]] was an assistant coach with the Bears in the 1960s when Ditka played, met with Ditka in an effort to persuade him to fill the spot on the ticket.

On July 14, however, Ditka announced he would not seek the nomination, citing personal and business considerations (his wife was against the run and he operates a chain of restaurants).<ref name=norun>{{cite web|url=http://www.local6.com/news/3532156/detail.html |title=Ditka: 'Second Thoughts Until The Day I Die' - Orlando News Story - WKMG Orlando |publisher=Local6.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-01}}</ref> Barack Obama went on to defeat former ambassador [[Alan Keyes]] in a landslide in the November 2004 election. In October 2008, Ditka introduced vice presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] at a rally in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]].

In stark contrast to the above-stated positions, Ditka appeared in an ad during the [[Illinois gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 Illinois gubernatorial election]] for incumbent Democrat [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]].  In the ad, Ditka states that, "[D]oing the right thing for the people who put you in office is more important than what you can do for yourself in office . . . and I think he'll do that.  I think he understands that . . . and I think he's good people."  Quinn, at the time, was locked into a tight race against State Senator [[Bill Brady (politician)|Bill Brady]], a conservative Republican from [[Bloomington, Illinois|Bloomington]].  Quinn would go on to narrowly defeat Brady.

In October 2011, Ditka and the 1985 team went to the [[White House]] after they didn't attend in 1986 due to the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]]. He presented President Obama with a Chicago Bears jersey with the number 85 on it with "Obama" on the back of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/chi-111007-superbowl-bears-whitehouse-pictures,0,1535075.photogallery |title=Photo gallery: 1985 Chicago Bears visit the White House |publisher=chicagotribune.com |date=2011-10-07 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In November 2012, Ditka was hospitalized with what was called a "very minor stroke". Because of this, Ditka did not work at the ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' studio for Week 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000095975/article/mike-ditka-suffers-very-minor-stroke-says-hes-ok|title=Mike Ditka suffers 'very minor stroke,' says he's OK|work=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-11-16|accessdate=2012-11-16}}</ref>
