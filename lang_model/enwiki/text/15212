'''USCGC ''Point Slocum'' (WPB-82313)''' was an 82 foot [[Point class cutter]] constructed at the [[United States Coast Guard Yard|Coast Guard Yard]] at [[Curtis Bay, Maryland]] in 1961 for use as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. Since the Coast Guard policy in 1960 was not to name [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutters]] under 100 feet in length, it was designated as ''WPB-82313'' when commissioned and acquired the name ''Point Slocum'' in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than 65 feet.<ref name="USCG">[http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Point_Class_WPB_Index.asp Coast Guard Historian website] </ref><ref name=Scheina72>Scheina, p 72</ref>

==Construction details==
''Point Slocum'' was built with a mild steel hull and an aluminum superstructure that could accommodate an 8 man crew.<ref name=Scheina71>Scheina, p 71</ref> She was powered by two 600 horsepower VT600 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five bladed 42 inch propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by 800 horsepower VT800 Cummins engines. Longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Water tank capacity was {{convert|1550|gal|liters|}} and fuel tank capacity was {{convert|1840|gal|liters|}} at 95% full. Frozen food storage was {{convert|23|ft3|m3|}}. Accommodations for a 13 man crew were installed for Vietnam service.<ref name="USCG" /><ref name=Scheina71>Scheina, p 71</ref><ref name=Scotti10>Scotti, p 10</ref><ref name=Scotti219>Scotti, p 219</ref>

==History==
After delivery in 1961, ''Point Slocum'' was assigned a homeport of [[St. Thomas, Virgin Islands]], where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat.<ref name="USCG" /> 

At the request of the [[United States Navy]], in October 1965, she was alerted for service in [[Vietnam]] and assigned to [[Coast Guard Squadron One]] in support of [[Operation Market Time]] along with 8 other Point class cutters.<ref name=Larzelere72>Larzelere, p 72</ref><ref name=Cutler84>Cutler, p 84</ref> While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at [[Coast Guard Island]] and [[Parks Reserve Forces Training Area|Camp Parks, California]], ''Point Slocum'' was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to [[Subic Bay]], [[Philippines]] arriving in January 1966 where she was refit for combat service.<ref name="USCG" /> Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of 4 [[M2 Browning machine gun|M-2 machine guns]]. The original [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]] was replaced with a combination over-under 50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam.<ref name="USCG" /><ref name="Wells" /><ref name=Larzelere21>Larzelere, p 21</ref><ref name=Cutler82>Cutler, p 82</ref> For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the crew complement to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.<ref name=Larzelere15>Larzelere, p 15</ref> 

''Point Slocum'' was assigned to Division 13 of Squadron One to be based at Cat Lo Navy Base near [[Vung Tau]], along with {{Ship|USCGC|Point Cypress|WPB-82326|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Point Grace|WPB-82323|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Point Hudson|WPB-82322|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Point Jefferson|WPB-82306|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Point Kennedy|WPB-82320|2|}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Point League|WPB-82304|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Point Partridge|WPB-82305|2}} and {{Ship|USCGC|Point White|WPB-82308|2}}. After sea trials, the Division left Subic Bay for Cat Lo on 19 February 1966 in the company of {{USS|Forster|DER-334}}, their temporary support ship. They arrived at their new duty station on 23 February and began patrolling the coastal waters near the [[Rung Sat Special Zone]].<ref name=Kelley5-450>Kelley, p 5-450</ref><ref name=Larzelere80>Larzelere, p 80</ref> Duty consisted of boarding Vietnamese junks to search for contraband weapons and ammunition and check the identification papers of persons on board.

On 20 June 1966 ''Point League'' and ''Point Slocum'' along with ''Point Hudson'' assisted with the capture of a North Vietnamese trawler loaded with ammunition near the mouth of the [[C<U+1ED5> Chi<U+00EA>n River]].<ref name="USCG" /><ref name=Larzelere70>Larzelere, p 70</ref><ref name=Johnson334>Johnson, p 334</ref> After the trawler was run aground she caught fire and {{USS|Haverfield|DER-393|}} and {{USS|Tortuga|LSD-26|}} provided firefighting teams assisted by ''Point League'' and ''Point Slocum''; both cutters pulled alongside the burning trawler and directed fire hoses on the cargo holds full of ammunition. Important intelligence was gathered by the cutter crews.<ref name=Larzelere72>Larzelere, p 72</ref><ref name=Scotti52>Scotti, p 52</ref>
 
As a part of the [[Vietnamization]] Program [[South Vietnamese Navy]] crewmen were assigned to the cutter for training purposes beginning in February 1969. After the crew of ''Point Slocum'' trained a Vietnamese replacement crew, she was turned over to the [[Republic of Vietnam Navy]] as a part of the Vietnamization Program and recommissioned as RVNS ''Nguy<U+1EC5>n Ng<U+1ECD>c Th<U+1EA1>ch'' (HQ-706), 11 December 1969.<ref name=Scotti211>Scotti, p 211</ref>
