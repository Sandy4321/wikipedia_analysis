From 1988 to 2005, Jackson lived on his [[Neverland Ranch]] property, where he built an [[amusement park]] and private [[zoo]] that was frequently attended by disadvantaged and [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]] children. Rumours of [[sleepover]] parties received negative media coverage after it was revealed that children frequently slept in his bed or bedroom. These first came to light when [[1993 child molestation allegations against Michael Jackson|he was accused of child sexual abuse in 1993]]. Michael Jackson's relationship with children was brought into the spotlight again in 2003 when the TV documentary ''[[Living with Michael Jackson]]'' aired. This resulted in Jackson being [[People v. Jackson|tried, and later acquitted]], of more child molestation allegations and several other charges in 2005. Since then, Michael Jackson has lived in countries such as [[Bahrain]] and [[Ireland]], but has since returned to the United States. Jackson is putting the "finishing touches on his new music" to be released next year.

{{main|The Jackson 5}}
Michael Jackson was born in [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]], [[Indiana]] to a working-class family. He was the second-youngest brother of seven and the eighth of ten children of [[Joseph Jackson|Joseph]] (Joe) and [[Katherine Jackson]].  Katherine, a [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]], raised the children in that faith, while Joe, who initially started studying with the Witnesses, eventually decided not to join.<ref name="magic">{{cite book |last=Taraborrelli |first=J.

Randy Taraborrelli |coauthors= |title=The Magic and the Madness |year=1991 |publisher=Headline |location= |id=ISBN 1-55972-064-6 }}</ref> Jackson's father, a steel mill employee who often performed in an R&B band called "The Falcons" with his brother Luther, was a strict [[disciplinarian]]. Many of the Jackson children recall being spanked or whipped by their father for misbehaving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1201949.stm|title=Jackson's life in the spotlight|accessdate=2007-06-28|work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> Jackson showed musical talent early on and joined his brothers when they formed a group in 1964. 

During this period, the boys toured Indiana extensively, and after winning a major local talent show in 1966 with a rendition of [[The Temptations]]' "[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]", led by Michael, they began playing professional gigs in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]] and across the mid-eastern U.S. Many of these gigs were in a string of black clubs and venues collectively known as the "[[chitlin' circuit]]," and the young kids sometimes had to open for [[strip tease]]rs and other adult acts in order to earn money.<ref name=RRHF>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/the-jackson-five |title=The Jackson Five |accessdate=2007-05-29 |format= |work=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] }}</ref> The young Jackson had taken co-lead singing duties with brother [[Jermaine Jackson|Jermaine]] when the group's name changed from "The Jackson Brothers" to "[[The Jackson 5]]" in 1966. 

The group eventually auditioned for, and signed a contract with, Motown Records in 1968.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/jackson_michael/bio.jhtml |title=Michael Jackson: Biography |accessdate=2006-11-11 |format= |work=[[VH1]] }}</ref> They hit stardom with their first four singles, "[[I Want You Back]]", "[[ABC (song)|ABC]]", "[[The Love You Save]]", and "[[I'll Be There]]", which charted at #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], the first time ever a group had pulled off that feat.<ref name="RRHF" /> As a solo artist, Jackson released a total of four studio albums with Motown, among them ''[[Got to Be There]]'' in 1971 and ''[[Ben (album)|Ben]]'' in the following year. These were released as part of the Jackson 5 franchise and produced successful singles such as "[[Got to Be There (song)|Got to Be There]]", "[[Ben (song)|Ben]]", and a remake of [[Bobby Day]]'s "[[Rockin' Robin (song)|Rockin' Robin]]".

The group's sales declined after 1973 and they chafed under Motown's strict refusal to allow them creative control or input. In 1976, the group signed a new contract with [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] (first joining the [[Philadelphia International Records|Philadelphia International]] division and then [[Epic Records]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:9idxlffescqe |title=The Jacksons Story: Overview |accessdate=2006-11-11 |format= |work=All Music Guide }}</ref> When this became apparent to [[Motown Records]], they sued the group for breach of contract.<ref name="magic" />

As a result of the legal proceedings, which were complicated further by the fact that [[Jermaine Jackson]] was married to the daughter of Motown president ([[Berry Gordy]]), the Jacksons lost the rights to use the "Jackson 5" name and logo.<ref name="magic" /> Jermaine left the group, choosing to stay at Motown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artistopia.com/michael-jackson |title=Michael Jackson Biography |accessdate=2006-11-12 |format= |work=Aristopia }}</ref> They changed their name to "The Jacksons", featuring youngest brother [[Randy Jackson (musician)|Randy]] in Jermaine's place, and continued their successful career, touring internationally and releasing six more albums between 1976 and 1984, with Jermaine eventually re-joining in 1983, making them a sextet. From 1976 to 1984, Michael was the lead songwriter of the group,<ref>[http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/the-jackson-five Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame & Museum]</ref> laying down such hits as "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]", "[[This Place Hotel]]", and "[[Can You Feel It]]". In 1978, Jackson starred as the scarecrow in ''[[The Wiz]]'' with former-label mate [[Diana Ross]] playing Dorothy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078504/ |title=The Wiz |accessdate=2006-11-11 |format= |work=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] }}</ref> The songs for the [[Musical film|musical]] were arranged by [[Quincy Jones]], who established a partnership with Jackson during the film's production and agreed to produce his first solo album in four years.<ref name="magic" />

=== 1979: ''Off the Wall'' ===
{{main|Off the Wall}}
''[[Off the Wall]]'', released in 1979, was a worldwide success story that made music history, becoming the first [[album]] ever to spawn four top-ten hits, including the number-one hits, "[[Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough]]" and "[[Rock with You]]".<ref name="mj70" /> It reached #3 in the Billboard album charts, spending 48 consecutive weeks inside the Top 20.<ref name=LesChiffres>{{cite web |url=http://fanofmusic.free.fr/Site-MJpart-LesChiffres-OffTheWall.htm |title=Off the Wall |accessdate=2007-05-29 |format= |work=Fan of Music }}</ref> Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson jointly produced the album, with lyrics and music by Jackson, [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]]'s [[Rod Temperton]], [[Stevie Wonder]], and [[Paul McCartney]], among others. The album signaled the arrival of a new Michael Jackson, one not reliant upon his brothers to further his career.<ref name=definitive200>{{cite web |url=http://www.definitive200.com/200_list.php|title=200 list|accessdate=2007-03-21|format= |work=definitive200.com }}</ref> ''Off the Wall'', buoyed by its catchy dance rhythms and avoidance of the "shallow excesses...of the period's disco,"<ref name=definitive200>{{cite web |url=http://www.definitive200.com/200_list.php|title=200 list|accessdate=2007-03-21|format= |work=definitive200.com }}</ref> eventually sold some 20 million copies worldwide.<ref name=mjjcharts.com>{{cite web |url=http://www.mjjcharts.com/MichaelGlobalAlbums.htm |title=Michael - Worldwide Album Sales |accessdate=2007-03-16 |format= |work=MJJCharts |date=[[March 21]] [[2007]] }}</ref> Despite its commercial success, Jackson felt the album should have made a much bigger impact and was determined to exceed expectations with his next release. 

In January 1980, Jackson won his first awards for his solo efforts at the [[American Music Awards]]. He won "Favorite Soul/R&B Album" (for ''Off the Wall''), "Favorite Male Soul/R&B Artist" and Favorite Soul/R&B Single (for "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough").<ref name="mj70" /> Later that month, he also won two [[Billboard Music Award|Billboard Awards]] (for "Top Black Artist" and "Top Black Album").<ref name="mj70" /> On [[February 27]] [[1980]], Jackson won a [[Grammy Award]] for "Best R&B Vocal Performance, Male" (for "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough").<ref name="mj70" />

More than twenty-five years after its release, ''Off the Wall'' remains one of the defining moments in Jackson's music career as it began his domination as one of pop music's leading artists. In 2003, the [[TV network]] [[VH1]] named ''Off the Wall'' the thirty-sixth greatest album of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailycelebrations.com/vh1_albums.htm |title=VH1 List of 100 Best Rock Albums|accessdate=2007-05-29 |format= |work=DailyCelebrations }}</ref>  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it #68 in their list of the [[500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time |title=The RS 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|accessdate=2007-05-29 |format= |work=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

=== 1982: ''Thriller'' ===
{{main|Thriller (album)|We Are the World|Captain EO}}

In November 1982, the storybook for ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' was released. It included Jackson reading the story as well as one original song ("Someone in the Dark"). The album later won a Grammy for "Best Album for Children".<ref>[http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&winner=Michael+Jackson&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1 Grammy.com]</ref>  On the first day of the following month, Jackson released his second Epic album, ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]''. ''Thriller'' became by far the biggest selling album of all time with worldwide sales reaching over 104 million copies.<ref>[http://www.mtv.co.uk/channel/mtvuk/news/16112006/jackos_back MTV UK: Jacko's Back!]</ref>

The album also became the first in history to spawn seven top-ten Billboard Hot 100 hit singles,<ref name="mj80">{{cite web |url=http://michaeljackson.com/lofi/history-main-1980s.html |title=History: 2000s |accessdate=2007-08-18 |format= |work=Michael Jackson's official website }}</ref> including "[[Billie Jean]]", which was the first [[music video]] by a [[African American|black]] artist to receive regular airplay on [[MTV]],<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/LegalCenter/story?id=464753&page=1 ABC News: "Why Are Michael Jackson's Fans So Devoted?" Feb. 23, 2005]</ref> "[[Beat It]]", and the album's [[Thriller (song)|title track]], which was accompanied by a revolutionary music video. The thirteen-minute "[[Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]" video was critically acclaimed and massive airplay lead to it being packaged with the [[featurette]] ''Making Michael Jackson's Thriller'' on [[VHS]], where it became the best-selling music [[home video]] ever.<ref name="mj80" /> ''Thriller'' spent 37 weeks at #1 and remained on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[album]] chart for 122 weeks. It was eventually certified 27x Platinum in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mjinf.co.uk/Thriller/Thriller.htm |title=Thriller |accessdate=2006-11-20 |work=The Ultimate Michael Jackson Stats Site }}</ref>

In 1983, while performing "Billie Jean" at the [[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]] concert, Jackson debuted what can be regarded as his signature 
move: the [[moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]].<ref name="mj80" /> The performance sparked a new wave of interest in ''Thriller'', which continued to sell well throughout the year. In 1983, he started a sponsorship deal with [[Pepsi|Pepsi-Cola]], and, as part of the deal, he agreed to star in a commercial. While filming the commercial in front of 3,000 fans the following year, a fireworks display behind him malfunctioned, shooting a shower of sparks down upon the singer<U+2019>s head and setting fire to his hair. He suffered [[Burn (injury)|second-degree burns]] and later wore a hairpiece when collecting Grammys that year.<ref>{{cite news | first= David | last= Peisner | title=

In February 1984, Jackson was nominated for twelve [[Grammy Awards of 1984|Grammy awards]] - of which he won eight<ref name="mj80" /> - breaking the record for the most Grammy awards won in a single year.<ref>{{cite book |last=[[Guinness World Records]] |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Guinness World Records 2007 |year=2006 |publisher=Guinness |location= |id=ISBN 1-904994-12-1 }}</ref> Seven were for ''Thriller'' and the other for the ''E.T.: The Extra-terrestrial'' storybook. In 1984, he also won eight American Music Awards and the "Special Award of Merit" and three MTV Video Music Awards.<ref name="mj80" />

''Thriller'' was a gigantic hit that made Michael Jackson the seminal icon of American culture at the time. At the age of 25, the [[New York Times]] called him a "musical phenomenon", further commenting that "in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else".<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news | first= | last= | title= MICHAEL JACKSON AT 25: A MUSICAL PHENOMENON  | date= January 1984 | publisher= New York

The album dominated much of the world's conscience in its heyday; as one [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] high school senior put it, "[Michael Jackson's] music is electrifying. His beat is the music of today."<ref name=TIME/> The [[Government of the Soviet Union|Kremlin]] disagreed with their citizen, denouncing Michael Jackson as a "great show-biz swindle known as 'The Thriller'" and accusing the singer of serving the Reagan administration by taking the American people's minds off the country's problems.<ref name=NYTimes9>{{cite news | first= | last= | title= Russians Denounce Michael Jackson | date= June 1984 | publisher= New York Times | url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70F12FB3C5D0C728EDDAF0894DC484D81 | accessdate= 2007-05-15| language= English }}</ref>  In May 1984, stores across the country started selling dolls of the superstar, who also became something of a sexual symbol, as he was described by [[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]]: "Undeniably sexy. Absolutely safe.

As a sign of his stature at the time, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] officials considered inviting Jackson to their [[United States presidential nominating convention|national convention]], in 1984, where they would renominate Reagan, but a change of plans left Ron Walker, the convention manager, stating that "We never thought we had a ghost

[[Image:Michael Jackson Reagan.gif|thumb|right|250px|Jackson (middle) with the Reagans in 1984. This was Jackson's first trip to the White House; in his second, six years later, he would meet with then [[George H. W. Bush|President George H. W. Bush]].]]
After reuniting with his brothers, he helped to write and produce  the ''[[Victory (album)|Victory]]'' album. He then performed and starred in the [[Victory Tour]], which started on [[July 6]], [[1984]] and lasted for five months.<ref name="mj80" /> That year, Jackson was invited to the White House and was thanked by President [[Ronald Reagan]] at a [[White House]] ceremony for allowing the song "[[Beat It]]" to be used in [[Drunk driving (United States)|drunk driving]] prevention television and radio [[public service announcement]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adcouncil.org/default.aspx?id=137 |title=Drunk Driving Prevention (1983<U+2013>Present) |accessdate=2006-11-11 |format= |work=[[Ad Council]] }}</ref> 

Jackson continued his charity work in 1985 by co-writing with [[Lionel Richie]] the hit song "[[We Are the World]]", and singing a featured solo on the charity [[Single (music)|single]]. The record helped to raise money and awareness for the [[famine]] in [[East Africa]] and was one of the first instances where Jackson was seen as a [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]]. The song also won a Grammy for "Song of the Year".<ref name="mj80" /> "We Are the World" became one of the top five best-selling singles of all time and the best selling single of the 1980s<ref>[http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id201.htm EightiesClub.com]</ref>

Controversy began when Jackson purchased [[Share (finance)|shares]] in [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing|ATV Music Publishing]] (a company which owned the publishing rights to most of [[the Beatles]]' songs), making himself the majority [[shareholder]]. This move angered close friend and songwriter [[Paul McCartney]], who had also made a bid for the company.<ref name="magic" /> Ironically, it had been McCartney who advised Jackson on the merits of song ownership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/jackson.htm |title=Michael Jackson owns the rights to the Beatles' songs |accessdate=2006-11-11 |format= |work=[[Urban Legends Reference Pages]] }}</ref> Their creative co-writing ended after this event. Following this controversial business deal, [[tabloid]] stories of Jackson sleeping in a [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy|hyperbaric oxygen]] chamber to stall the aging-process, and an allegation claiming Jackson attempted to purchase the bones of the [[Joseph Merrick|Elephant Man]] inspired the [[pejorative]] [[sobriquet]] "Wacko Jacko" (wacko meaning eccentric or irrational)<ref>[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wacko]</ref>. The name "Wacko Jacko," first used by British media, would come to be detested by Jackson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:os320r4ac48b~T1 |title=Michael Jackson: Biography |accessdate=2006-11-11 |format= |work=All Music Guide }}</ref>

In 1986, Jackson starred in the [[George Lucas]]-produced, [[Francis Ford Coppola]]-directed [[3-D film]] ''[[Captain EO]]''.

''Dangerous'' featured several major worldwide hits, including "[[Black or White (song)|Black or White]]",  "[[Remember the Time]]", "[[In the Closet]]", "[[Give In To Me]]", and "[[Heal the World]]". ''Dangerous'' was heavily anticipated, as highlighted by an incident at the [[Los Angeles International Airport]] that witnessed a group of armed robbers stealing 30,000 copies of the new album before its official release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beach-bulletin.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=3195 |title=Flashbacks!|accessdate=2007-06-30 |format= |work=beach-bulletin.com }}</ref>

The biggest hit single in the United States from the album was "Black or White", which reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and remained there for seven weeks,<ref>[http://www.mjinf.co.uk/Dangerous/Black%20or%20White.htm]</ref> with similar performances around the world. The single was accompanied by a controversial [[music video|video]], premi<U+00E8>ring as a simulcast on the [[Fox network]], [[MTV]] and [[BET]], which featured scenes construed as having a [[erotica|sexual nature]] as well as depictions of [[violence|violent behavior]].

In the [[UK]] as well as other parts of Europe "[[Heal the World]]" was the biggest hit from the album. In Britain, it sold 455,000 copies alone and spent 5 weeks at #2. It was the christmas #2 of 1992 and because of extra seasonal sales it outsold "Black or White <ref>"http://www.mjinf.co.uk/Dangerous/Heal_the_world.htm</ref>.

On [[February 10]] [[1992]], [[MTV]] kicked off its first global sweepstakes with "My Dinner with Michael".

"[[Earth Song]]" was the third single released from ''HIStory'' and was accompanied by one of the most expensive and lavish videos of Jackson's career. The song topped the U.K. singles chart for six weeks over Christmas in 1995 and sold one million copies there, making it his most successful U.K. single, surpassing the success of "Billie Jean". At the 1996 [[BRIT Awards]] Jackson was awarded as the Artist of A Generation.<ref>[http://brits.co.uk/winners/1996/]</ref> At the ceremony Jackson performed the track "Earth Song", dressed in white and surrounded by children and an actor portraying a rabbi.

"[[They Don't Care About Us]]" was the fourth single released from ''HIStory'' and caused controversy over alleged[[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] lyrics. The song contained the lyrics "Jew me, sue me" and "kick me, [[kike]] me." After significant pressure from the Jewish community, later releases changed the verse to the same-sounding "do me, sue me" and "kick me, strike me" or censored it with a thumping sound.  

==== 1997: ''Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix'' ====
{{Main|Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix}}
In 1997, Jackson released an album of new material titled ''[[Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix]]'' with remixes of hit singles from ''HIStory'';<ref name="mj90" /> it sold six million copies worldwide and became the [[List of best-selling remix albums worldwide|greatest selling remix album ever]], reaching #1 in Britain.

In October 2001, ''Invincible'' was released<ref name="mj00">{{cite web |url=http://michaeljackson.com/lofi/history-main-2000s.html |title=History: 2000s |accessdate=2006-11-11 |format= |work=Michael Jackson's official website }}</ref> and debuted at number-one in thirteen countries.<ref name="MSNBC Trotkop"/> ''Invincible'' went on to sell nearly 8 million copies worldwide.<ref name=mjjcharts.com>{{cite web |url=http://www.mjjcharts.com/MichaelGlobalAlbums.htm |title=Michael - Worldwide Album Sales |accessdate=2007-03-16 |format= |work=MJJCharts |date=[[March 21]] [[2007]] }}</ref> The album spawned three singles: "[[You Rock My World]]," "[[Cry (Michael Jackson song)|Cry]]," and "[[Butterflies (Michael Jackson song)|Butterflies]]." Around the same time that ''Invincible'' came out, Jackson and 35 other artists recorded a charity benefit single entitled "[[What More Can I Give]]", designed to raise money for [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] victims, which was never released. 

Just before the release of ''Invincible'', Jackson informed the head of Sony Music Entertainment, [[Tommy Mottola]], that he was not going to renew his contract;<ref name="FOX"/> the contract was about to expire in terms of supplying the label with albums of full-new material for release through [[Epic Records]]/[[Sony Music Entertainment|SME]]. In 2002, all singles releases, video shootings, and promotions concerning the ''Invincible'' album were canceled. As a result of this, Jackson made allegations about Mottola not supporting its [[African American]] artists.<ref name="FOX"/> Jackson referred to Mottola as a "devil" and a "racist" who used black artists for his own personal gain.<ref name="FOX"/> He cited that Mottola called Jackson's colleague [[Irving Lorenzo|Irv Gotti]] a "fat [[nigger]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.surgeontothestars.com/pages/celebrities/micheal_jackson.shtml |title=Michael Jackson |accessdate=2006-11-19 |format= |work=Surgeon to the Stars }}</ref><ref>{{cite interview |last=Jackson |first=Jermaine |subjectlink=Jermaine Jackson |interviewer=[[Connie Chung]] |title= |callsign = |city= |date=[[December 31]] [[2002]] |program=[[Connie Chung Tonight]] |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0212/31/cct.00.html }}</ref> Sony issued a statement stating that they found the allegations strange since Mottola was once married to [[Multiracial|biracial]] pop star [[Mariah Carey]].

On [[September 7]] and [[September 10]] [[2001]], Jackson organized a special [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special|30th Anniversary celebration]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] for his 30th year of being a solo artist.

===Music videos and MTV===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Thriller Video Clip.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Jackson dancing with zombies in the "[[Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]" music video.]] -->
Michael Jackson is widely regarded as being the first artist to elevate music videos to a meaningful art form,<ref name=BMI/> setting off new trends of story-telling, mini-movies, and choreographed dance sequences that dominate the genre to this day. The concept of the short film, epitomized by 1983's "Thriller" but also seen in other Jackson videos such as "[[Ghosts]]", "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]", "[[Smooth Criminal]]", and "[[Remember the Time]]", would largely remain unique to him, but the group-scene dancing pioneered by "Beat It" and popularized by "Thriller" has been a staple of music videos ever since. The dance sequence from "Thriller" has captivated popular culture worldwide, being replicated everywhere from [[India]]n movies to Western wedding ceremonies.<ref name=youtube>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmYbP0F4Zw |title=Wedding Thriller Dance |accessdate=2007-04-11 |format= |work=youtube.com }}</ref><ref name=youtube1>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbvP7dT3Dx0 |title=Indian Thriller |accessdate=2007-04-11 |format= |work=youtube.com }}</ref>

Central to Michael Jackson<U+2019>s success with music videos was the relatively young music channel MTV, created in 1981, which put Jackson<U+2019>s videos in heavy rotation throughout the 1980s. Before the fruitful relationship materialized, however, Jackson struggled against the channel just to have his videos aired. In 1983, when Jackson came out with "Billie Jean", his first video from ''Thriller'', MTV rarely aired videos by African-American performers and promptly refused Jackson<U+2019>s requests for a running.<ref name=blender>{{cite web |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=1777 |title=Michael Jackson, "Billy Jean: |accessdate=2007-04-11 |format= |work=blender.com }}</ref> Upon hearing the news, [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] President [[Walter Yetnikoff]] went livid, denouncing MTV and warning, "I<U+2019>m pulling everything we have off the air, all our product. I<U+2019>m not going to give you any more videos. And I<U+2019>m going to go public and fucking tell them about the fact you don<U+2019>t want to play music by a black guy".<ref name=blender/> Yetnikoff's harsh stance and rhetoric worked; MTV retreated and started giving "Billie Jean" heavy coverage, laying the groundwork for a dynamic partnership with Jackson that would last for years. When the 14-minute long music video for "Thriller" came out in December 1983, it took MTV by storm, running as often as twice within an hour at its height. True to its name, the video also had the feeling of a psychological thriller, reportedly scaring viewers across the United States, especially young children. "[[Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]" marked the beginning of a new era in music videos and is often cited as the greatest music video of all time.<ref name=vh1>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/jackson_michael/bio.jhtml |title=Michael Jackson |accessdate=2007-02-22 |format= |work=vh1.com }}</ref> 

Michael Jackson is often credited for putting [[MTV]], initially a struggling cable channel, on the map "with pioneering videos such as "Thriller", "[[Billie Jean#Impact of song and music video|Billie Jean]]", and "[[Beat It#Music video and choreography|Beat It]]"."<ref name=ABCNews>{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/LegalCenter/story?id=464753&page=1|title=Why Are Michael Jackson's Fans So Devoted? |accessdate=2007-04-06 |format= |work=abcnews.com }}</ref> In response to Jackson's influence, MTV shifted its musical focus as time went on, going from rock videos to more and more pop and R&B showings.<ref name=USATODAY>{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-08-25-mtv_x.htm|title=Music videos changing places |accessdate=2007-04-11 |format= |work=abcnews.com }}</ref>

===Legacy of ''Thriller''===
Released in 1982, ''Thriller'' became the most commercially successful album of all time and one of the most critically acclaimed, single-handedly transforming Jackson into his generation's Elvis or the Beatles and making him the "late 20th century's pre-eminent pop icon".<ref name=blender/> It remains Jackson's most celebrated musical achievement and has acquired a prominent position in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]]. In the 1980s, it was an indelible part of American life, as described by TIME magazine, "The numbers, which are incredible, are also becoming indelible. How many Beatles were there? How many homers did Babe Ruth hit? How many Grammy Awards did Michael Jackson win on Feb. 28? How many copies of Thriller have been sold? Well, the Grammys are easy".<ref name=TIME/> 

The second track released from the album and Jackson's highest-selling single ever, "Billie Jean", has been described as "one of the most sonically eccentric, psychologically fraught, downright bizarre things ever to land on Top 40 radio".<ref name=blender/> Jackson's earlier solo work in ''Off the Wall'' had revealed a disco-funk combination, but "Billie Jean," edged onwards by a "pulsing, cat-on-the-prowl bass figure, whip-crack downbeat and eerie multi-tracked vocals ricocheting in the vast spaces between keyboards and strings",<ref name=blender/> featured a new and revolutionary sound, one that made Jackson's idiosyncratic vocals a staple of pop music and established a sleek, post-soul tune "whose echoes can be heard to this day".<ref name=blender/> Apart from the title track and the accompanying music video, the album's other memorable single was "Beat It", which Jackson described as "the type of rock song that I would go out and buy, but also something totally different from the rock music I was hearing on Top Forty radio".<ref name=RollingStone>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596182/beat_it |title=Beat It |accessdate=2007-04-11 |format= |work=rollingstone.com }}</ref> The song was a crossover hit, buoyed by a "watch-my-fingers-fly guitar solo provided by [[Eddie Van Halen]]".<ref name=RollingStone/> 

Apart from establishing Jackson's iconic status and a new pop sound, ''Thriller'' revolutionized the music industry, which was watching in anticipation as the juggernaut comfortably and steadily broke record after record. Gil Friesen, President of [[A&M Records]], stated that "the whole industry has a stake in this success".<ref name=TIME/> At its height, ''Thriller'' was an industry in and of itself, with the ''Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller'', a videotape describing the secrets behind the new music video that was released in the [[Christmas]] of 1983, going on to sell 350,000 copies by March 1984.<ref name=TIME/> 

The main influence ''Thriller'' had on the industry involved raising the importance of the album as a means of musical distribution. After ''Thriller'', which, by posting seven top ten Hot 100 hits, had shattered traditional notions of how many singles an album could release before falling in popularity,<ref name=vh1>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/jackson_michael/bio.jhtml |title=Michael Jackson |accessdate=2007-02-22 |format= |work=vh1.com }}</ref> record companies took an interest in following Michael Jackson's approach of releasing high-profile albums once every few years. Although the importance of singles relative to albums had started to wane before the 1980s, ''Thriller'' firmly established the album as the dominant force in the music industry, a status it retains to this day. 

TIME magazine summed up the impact of ''Thriller'' as follows: "For a record industry stuck on the border between the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop, ''Thriller'' was a thorough restoration of confidence, a rejuvenation. Its effect on listeners, especially younger ones, was nearer to a revelation".<ref name=TIME/> Additionally, ''Thriller'' marked the return of black music to commercial radio for the first time in years, leading Quincy Jones to the following characterization of the doors opened by Michael Jackson: "No doubt about it, he's taken us right up there where we belong. Black music had to play second fiddle for a long time, but its spirit is the whole motor of pop. Michael has connected with every soul in the world".<ref name=TIME/> By overcoming what some have called the "apartheid of pop", Jackson paved the way for the success of future acts, most immediately and notably Prince, who had been confined to low levels of airplay before ''Thriller'' opened the floodgates.<ref name=WashPost1>{{cite news | first= Richard | last= Harrington | title= Prince & Michael Jackson: Two Paths to the Top of Pop | date= October 1988 | publisher= Washington Post | url= http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73636369.html?dids=73636369:73636369&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Oct+9%2C+1988&author=Richard+Harrington&pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&edition=&startpage=g.01&desc=Prince+%26+Michael+Jackson%3A+Two+Paths+to+the+Top+of+Pop | accessdate= 2007-05-21| language= English }}</ref>

===Style and performance===
Among the most celebrated aspects of Michael Jackson's career have been his dance, fashion, and vocal styles, which have given rise to impersonators all over the world. In 1984, TIME magazine wrote the following on the singer's notable style: "His high-flying tenor makes him sound like the lead in some funked-up boys choir, even as the sexual dynamism irradiating from the arch of his dancing body challenges Government standards for a nuclear meltdown. His lithe frame, five-fathom eyes, long lashes might be threatening if Jackson gave, even for a second, the impression that he is obtainable".<ref name=TIME/> 

Jackson's dancing abilities were always an important part of his life, and ones that he honed through constant training and dedication, manifested, according to TIME, by "[shutting] himself up at the house in a room that has no mirrors<U+2014>"Mirrors make you pose," he has said<U+2014>and [cutting] loose to his own music or to the Isley Brothers' Showdown, practicing what Dancer Hinton Battle calls "moves that kill. It's the combinations that really distinguish him as an artist. Spin, stop, pull up leg, pull jacket open, turn, freeze. And the glide, where he steps forward while pushing back. Spinning three times and popping up on his toes. That's a trademark, and a move a lot of professionals wouldn't try. If you go up wrong, you can really hurt yourself".<ref name=TIME/> Jackson has been described as an "avant-garde dancer" that allowed his techniques to acquire meaning through the "theatrical context" surrounding them.<ref name=NYTimes4>{{cite news | first= Anna | last= Kisselgoff | title= Stage: The Dancing Feet Of Michael Jackson | date= March 1988 | publisher= New York Times | url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DE1539F935A35750C0A96E948260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fJ%2fJackson%2c%20Michael | accessdate= 2007-04-19 | language= English }}</ref> His dancing abilities, sometimes compared to past greats like [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Rudolf Nureyev]],<ref name=telegraph/> have contributed strongly to his perceived status as one of the greatest performers of all time. 

Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" outing at [[Motown 25]] on May 16, 1983 is widely regarded as one of the greatest performances of all time, despite the fact that Jackson lip-synched the song. More than 50 million viewers tuned in to see the special and Jackson perform his most popular song at the time.<ref name=blender/> It marked a new height in his popularity, pushed forward by the publicly-dubbed "[[Moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]]," an illusory move designed to create the impression that the dancer is walking backwards. The moonwalk became Jackson's signature dance move and he would replicate it in all future performances of "Billie Jean." Jackson did not invent the move, but he was responsible for perfecting it, making it a household name, and enshrining it into the psyche of American culture, which witnessed kids and people of all age groups trying to do the move after the Motown special as well as earning a fitting peroration from the [[The New York Times|New York Times]]: "The moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style. How does he do it? As a technician, he is a great illusionist, a genuine mime. His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing".<ref name=NYTimes4/> 

Michael Jackson's outfits, everything from the sequined white glove, which has led to some dubbing him as "The Gloved One", to the jacket in the "Thriller" music video, have been essential components of his image and performance. The "Jheri-curled hair and single-gloved, zippered-jacket look" became a favorite for many people across the United States in the 1980s.<ref name=cnnlife>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Music/01/30/jackson.life/ |title=Michael Jackson: A life in the spotlight |accessdate=2007-04-11 |format= |work=cnn.com }}</ref> Jackson has also made the [[fedora hat]] something of a trademark in his exhibitions, and many modern artists pay tribute to the look.

===Themes and genres===
Michael Jackson's musical palette has covered everything from disco and pop to rock and R&B. Jackson's musical themes have been equally varied, featuring material on typical pop subjects like love and joy as well as more mature works on [[social justice]] and his convoluted relationship with the media. Jackson's solo career with Motown in the 1970s was largely unimaginative, dominated as it was by label-backed songwriters and producers intent on giving the young performer typical ballads and other similarly-styled melodious tracks. In his two-decade career with Epic, however, Jackson displayed extensive creativity, gradually evolving from compositions with mild, non-controversial messages to songs dealing with increasingly solemn and darker themes, a reflection of his personal struggles and his status as an international icon.<ref name=NYTimes1>{{cite news | first= Jon | last= Pareles | title= POP VIEW; Michael Jackson Is Angry, Understand  | date= June 1995 | publisher= New York Times | url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0DD123DF93BA25755C0A963958260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fJ%2fJackson%2c%20Michael | accessdate= 2007-04-19 | language= English }}</ref>    

''Off the Wall'' and ''Thriller'' showcased a Michael Jackson primarily focused on making dance hits and ballads with catchy tunes and rhythms. While this preoccupation would continue in his future work, it would also be colored by various shifts and improvisations. Even in this early material, however, Jackson displayed notable paradoxes, mixing the melodious and comfortable sounds of "Lady in My Life" with the haunting and terrorized environments of "Billie Jean" and "Beat It", where women accused him of fathering their children and the outside world seemed strange and hostile.<ref name=NYTimes2>{{cite news | first= Jon | last= Pareles | title= Critic's Notebook; How Good Is Jackson's 'Bad'? | date= September 1987 | publisher= New York Times | url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DC1F38F930A3575AC0A961948260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fJ%2fJackson%2c%20Michael | accessdate= 2007-04-19 | language= English }}</ref> ''Bad'' was accused by some of not delivering the exciting lyrics evident in ''Thriller'', being more intent on consolidating a traditional pop sound and defeating the records of Jackson's previous releases.<ref name=NYTimes2/> The album left clues for future projects, however, mentioning in the tense intro to "[[I Just Can't Stop Loving You]]" that "A lot of people misunderstand me....because they don't know me at all".<ref name=NYTimes2/> ''Bad'' included Jackson's first major inspirational song, "[[Man in the Mirror]]", which was praised for its message and captivating sound and also criticized as, among other things, "pure pabulum."<ref name=NYTimes2/> 

Jackson's work in the 1990s was characterized by more introspective material. Some have argued that the ''Dangerous'' album represented Jackson at a "near peak" in terms of musical quality and creativity<ref name=Allmguide>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:0hrsa9igb23u |title= Dangerous Review |accessdate=2007-06-04 |format= |work=[[All Music Guide]]}}</ref> and received more critical acclaim than his previous ''Bad'' album.<ref>[http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1201949.stm]</ref> Several things remained the same, with the title track to ''Dangerous'' ensuring another song about a "predatory lover".<ref name=NYTimes3>{{cite news | first= Jon | last= Pareles | title= RECORDINGS VIEW; Michael Jackson in the Electronic Wilderness | date= November 1991 | publisher= New York Times | url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2D6143DF937A15752C1A967958260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fJ%2fJackson%2c%20Michael | accessdate= 2007-04-19 | language= English }}</ref> More and more of Jackson's music in the decade, like "[[Black or White (song)|Black or White]]", "[[Heal the World]]", "[[They Don't Care About Us]]", and "[[Earth Song]]", started addressing sociopolitical issues around the world. The music in ''Dangerous'', described as a "a sonic machine world" with "synthetic basslines, swooshing scratched records, [and] clanking metallic noises", reflected old influences while absorbing new trends, made all the more pressing by Jackson's habit of releasing albums once every four or so years, time periods that allowed for significant development in the sound of pop music.<ref name=NYTimes3/> 

''HIStory'', arguably Jackson's most conflictive album, revealed a "furious" pop icon worn by years of superstardom,<ref name=NYTimes1/> with [[Jon Pareles]] of the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] writing that "It has been a long time since Michael Jackson was simply a performer. He's the main asset of his own corporation, which is a profitable subsidiary of Sony".<ref name=NYTimes1/> The album featured Jackson using profanity and other controversial lyrics, which forced him to modify some of the words to "They Don't Care About Us". Edged onwards by a quasi-messianic flair, he also railed against the media in "[[Tabloid Junkie]]", singing, "With your pen you torture me/You'd crucify the Lord" and that "Just because you read it in a magazine/ Or see it on a TV screen/ Don't make it factual".<ref name=NYTimes1/> ''HIStory'' mostly encompassed reflective compositions, presenting only one conventional love song, "[[You Are Not Alone]]".<ref name=NYTimes1/>

==== Connection with Slash ====
{{reqphoto}}
{{See also|Slash (musician)}}
Jackson formed a long term musical bond with world famous guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]]. Indeed, Slash is Michael Jackson's only long term musical partner outside of The Jackson 5/The Jacksons though his work with other artists on ''Thriller'' is probably remembered better (Sir Paul McCartney and Eddie Van Halen were both involved in that album).

Slash first came to fame as lead guitarist for [[Guns N' Roses]] from 1985 to 1996, though he has remained prolific ever since in various ventures such as [[Slash's Snakepit]] and [[Velvet Revolver]]<ref name=Allmguide>{{cite web |url=http://wc02.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:wpfqxqrgldte~T1|title= Slash Biography|accessdate=2007-21-09 |format= |work=[[All Music Guide]]}}</ref>. Despite Slash being a punky hard rocker from sleazy parts of L.A., his style provided a contrasting foil to Jackson's own image.
	 
Slash first joined Jackson in 1991 for the ''Dangerous'' album. He wrote and performed the introduction to "Black or White", and played three solos on "Give in to Me"<ref>''[[Dangerous]]'' album credits - booklet included with album</ref>. During the ''Dangerous World Tour'', Slash appeared with Jackson for a few performances of "Black or White" and at music award ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mjinf.co.uk/Dangerous/Black%20or%20White.htm|title= Michael Jackson Info|accessdate=2007-21-09 |format= |work=[[MJInfo]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.michael-jackson-trader.com/tours/dangeroustour.html|title= Michael Jackson Trader|accessdate=2007-21-09 |format= |work=[[Michael Jackson Trader]]}}</ref>. Slash also featured in the video for "Give in to Me", performing the song (in its entirety, not just his solo) on stage with Jackson in a pseudo live performance featuring, among others, Guns N' Roses rhythm guitarist [[Gilby Clarke]].
	 
With "Beat It" on ''Thriller'', "Dirty Diana" on ''Bad'' and "Black or White" on ''Dangerous'', Jackson had made featuring a rockier song on each of his albums a routine, each with a famous guest guitarist. After Slash's work on ''Dangerous'' however, he became the regular guest guitarist for Michael Jackson albums. On ''HIStory'', he performed a solo for the song "D.S."<ref>HIStory album credits - booklet with credits included with album</ref> and on ''Invincible'' he did a solo during "Privacy". To confirm the guitarist's identity (now with positive connotations towards his work with Jackson), Jackson shouted "Slash!" before these solos.
	 
Slash has appeared with Jackson a few times since his appearances on stage during the ''Dangerous'' era. For example, he appeared on stage for the ''MTV Music Video Awards 1995'' during the introduction to "Black or White", following it up with a solo, then remained on stage to play along to the introduction to "Billie Jean"<ref>Michael Jackson HIStory on Film volume II VHS/DVD</ref>. In 2001, on Michael Jackson's [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special|30th Anniversary Special]] Slash appeared to perform "Black or White" and "Beat It" (including the trademark Eddie Van Halen solo){{Fact|date=October 2007}}. Despite having appeared on the last three Michael Jackson albums in a row, there is no word as of October 2007 on Michael Jackson's new studio album regarding Slash.

Slash has never performed any of the songs he performed with Michael Jackson at other concerts despite Velvet Revolver's wide range of live covers of songs. This is unsurprising given the completely different musical style he had to adopt while playing for Jackson.

==Personal life==
Michael Jackson's personal life has been under the spotlight for decades. His marriages and children, his physical appearance, his humanitarian efforts, and accusations of child molestation have all witnessed a variety of media coverage all over the world.

===Marriages and children===
[[Image:Michael Jackson2 2006.jpg|thumb|Michael Jackson with his children in [[Disneyland Paris]] in 2006]]

Jackson married [[Lisa Marie Presley]], the daughter of [[Elvis Presley]], in 1994. Presley maintained during their marriage that they shared a married couple's life and were sexually active.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Jackson |first=Michael |subjectlink= |last2=Presley |first2=Lisa Marie |subjectlink2=Lisa Marie Presley |interviewer=[[Diane Sawyer]] |title= |callsign = |city= |date=[[June 14]] [[1995]] |program=[[Primetime (TV series)|Primetime]] |url=http://www.allmichaeljackson.com/interviews/primetimeliveinterview.html }}</ref> They divorced less than two years later, although still remain friends.<ref name=MJfanclub>{{cite web |url=http://www.mjfanclub.net/history/interviews/debbie_interview_1997_II.html|title= Debbie Rowe speaks about Michael and Lisa Marie's friendship|accessdate=2006-11-11 |format= |work=|date=[[November 25]] [[1997]] }}</ref> Jackson's second wife [[Debbie Rowe]] spoke about the couple's post-marriage friendship amidst "stories about Michael having an affair with his ex-wife Lisa Marie Presley",<ref name="MJfanclub" /> saying that: "They have a relationship, and what people don't understand is his relationship with her is separate from his relationship with me. They're friends, they're very good friends... [and] I am glad that they have a relationship together. I am glad to see them together; they have a lot in common."<ref name="MJfanclub" />

On [[November 14]], [[1996]], during the [[Australia]]n leg of the [[HIStory World Tour]], Jackson married his dermatologist's nurse [[Deborah Jeanne Rowe]], with whom he fathered a son, Michael Joseph Jackson, Jr. (also known as "Prince"), and a daughter, Paris Katherine Jackson. Jackson and Rowe divorced in 1999. Jackson later said that Rowe wanted him to have the children as a "gift".<ref>{{cite interview |last=Jackson |first=Michael |subjectlink= |interviewer=[[Martin Bashir]] |title= |callsign = |city= |date=[[February 3]] [[2003]] |program=[[Living with Michael Jackson]] |url=http://www.mjshouse.com/stories/living_with_mj_transcript.html }}</ref> The [[Paternity (biology and medicine)|paternity]] of Michael Jackson's children has been heavily debated by the public. Both Jackson and Rowe have always maintained that his first two children were conceived naturally. 

In November 2002, Jackson traveled to [[Berlin]] to accept an award for his humanitarian efforts. He was surrounded by fans outside his room at the [[Hotel Adlon]] who were chanting in approval of the singer. According to the pop star, they also called out to see his baby. In response, Jackson brought his son onto the balcony, holding him in his right arm with a cloth loosely draped over the baby's face in order to protect his identity from the media. Jackson briefly extended the baby over the railing of the balcony. This raised concern as some perceived his actions as [[Child abuse|child endangerment]], although Jackson has vehemently denied these tabloid rumours, saying that he was holding the baby tightly. Jackson said that the media was wrong in their comments about him being irresponsible with his children, "I love my children," he explained. "I was holding my son tight. Why would I throw a baby off the balcony? That's the dumbest, stupidest story I ever heard."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mjshouse.com/stories/living_with_mj_transcript.html |title=Living with Michael Jackson |accessdate=2007-05-29 |format= |work=mjshouse.com }}</ref>

The controversial documentary ''[[Living with Michael Jackson]]'' aired in February 2003 in the UK (on the 3rd) and in the US (on the 6th). The documentary included interviews with Jackson which included information on his private life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0352524/ |title=Living with Michael Jackson: A Tonight Special |accessdate=2006-11-11 |format= |work=IMDb }}</ref> British journalist [[Martin Bashir]] and his film crew filmed Jackson for 18 months, also capturing his controversial behavior in [[Berlin]]. One particular part of the documentary, which stirred controversy and raised a significant level of concern, showed Jackson holding hands with a then 13-year-old [[cancer]] victim Gavin Arviso, and admitting to sharing his bedroom with him (but not in the same bed) as well as sharing his bed (non-sexually) with other children. 

Jackson felt betrayed by Bashir and complained that the film gives a distorted picture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/06/jackson.bashir.statement/index.html |title=Michael Jackson's statement |accessdate=2006-11-11 |format= |work=[[CNN]] |date=[[February 6]] [[2003]] }}</ref> In response to the media scrutiny, two specials were aired: ''Michael Jackson: The Footage You Were Never Meant to See'' and ''Michael Jackson's Private Home Movies''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1471179/20030410/jackson_michael.jhtml?headlines=true |title=Michael Jackson's 'Private Home Movies' To Air On Fox |accessdate=2006-11-19 |format= |work=MTV News |date=[[April 10]] [[2003]] }}</ref> ''Michael Jackson: The Footage You Were Never Meant to See'' which aired later in February showed uncut footage of the ''Living with Michael Jackson'' documentary. The ''Michael Jackson's Private Home Movies'' aired in April was a 2-hour special with footage of Michael Jackson's home videos and included commentary by Jackson.

===Humanitarian efforts===

Jackson began his charity work in 1981 with his brothers following the Triumph tour where they raised $100,000 for the Atlanta Children<U+2019>s Foundation <ref>[[http://www.allmichaeljackson.com/era/off-the-wall/index.html]]</ref> . In 1984, following his burning accident with Pepsi the drinks manufacture gave Jackson a $1.5 million out of court settlement which he donated to the Michael Jackson Burn Centre set up in his Honour<ref>{{cite book |last=Taraborrelli |first=J. Randy |authorlink=J. Randy Taraborrelli |coauthors= |title=The Magic and the Madness |year=1991 |publisher=Headline |location= |id=ISBN 1-55972-064-6 }}</ref>
. In July 1984 he donated his $5million share from the Victor tour to charity<ref>{{cite book |last=Taraborrelli |first=J. Randy |authorlink=J. Randy Taraborrelli |coauthors= |title=The Magic and the Madness |year=1991 |publisher=Headline |location= |id=ISBN 1-55972-064-6 }}</ref> 
. In 1985 Jackson co-wrote with [[Lionel Richie]] the hit song "[[We Are the World]]", and sung a featured solo on the charity [[Single (music)|single]]. The record helped to raise money and awareness for the [[famine]] in [[East Africa]] and was one of the first instances where Jackson was seen as a [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]]. All profits from his 1988 hit single "[[Man in the Mirror]]" went to charity.<ref>[http://www.mjtkop.com/home/modules/about_michael_jackson/fab_facts.php]</ref>

From 1985<U+2013>1990 Jackson had donated $500,000 to the United Negro College.<ref>[[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_n5_v45/ai_8540117]]</ref>
In 1992, Jackson founded the "Heal the World Foundation" (named after his humanitarian [[Single (music)|single]] "[[Heal the World]]"). The charity organization brought underprivileged children to Jackson's [[Neverland Ranch]], located outside [[Santa Ynez, California|Santa Ynez]], [[California]], to go on theme park rides which Jackson had built on the property after he purchased it in 1988. All profits from the [[Dangerous World Tour]] went to his foundation raising many millions of dollars in relief. Jacksons 1995 international #1 hit [[Earth Song]] showed a shift in his concerns to environmental issues and ends with a disclaimer asking for donations for his "Heal the World Foundation". In 1998 Jackson was nominated for a [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref name="CBS10102003" />

In late 2002, Jackson's Heal the World Foundation had net assets of just [[United States dollar|US$]]3,542 and reported $2,585 in expenses, mostly for management fees. The foundation was suspended in California since April 2002 for supposedly failing to file annual statements required of tax-exempt organizations, according to John Barrett, spokesman for the state Franchise Tax Board. The "Heal the World Foundation spread millions of dollars around the globe to help children threatened by war and disease," thanks to the efforts of Michael Jackson, but the forced closure of the Foundation leaves many of these children without aid.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4601265 |title=Jackson's foundation now virtually defunct |accessdate=2006-11-11 |format= |work=[[MSNBC]] |date=[[March 25]] [[2004]] }}</ref> At the [[World Music Awards]] in 2006 [[Beyonce]] announced that Jackson had given $300 million dollars to charity<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i4Lmv1i4g YouTube]</ref> and Jackson has been actively involved with 39 charity organisations around the world.<ref>[http://www.mjfanclub.net/history/beyond.html]</ref>

===Physical appearance===
Jackson's skin was a medium-brown color for the entire duration of his youth, but starting in 1982 his skin gradually became paler. This change became so noticeable that it gained widespread media coverage, with some tabloids claiming that he was bleaching his skin.  The structure of his face has changed as well, and a number of surgeons claim that Jackson had undergone multiple nasal surgeries as well as a forehead lift, thinned lips and cheekbone surgery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Cosmetic/story?id=131910&page=1 |title=Surgeon: Michael Jackson A 'Nasal Cripple' |accessdate=2006-11-11 |format= |work=[[ABC News]] |date=[[February 8]] [[2003]] }}</ref> 

However, on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in 1993, Jackson said that the change in his skin color was due to the disease [[vitiligo]].<ref name=Oprah1>{{cite interview |last=Jackson |first=Michael |subjectlink= |interviewer=[[Oprah Winfrey]] |title= |callsign = |city= |date=[[February 10]] [[1993]] |program=[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]] |url=http://www.allmichaeljackson.com/interviews/oprahinterview.html}}</ref> In the interview, Jackson became quite emotional, saying that: "I'm a black American, I am proud of my race. I am proud of who I am. I have a lot of pride and dignity... I have a skin disorder that destroys the pigmentation of my skin, it's something that I cannot help, OK? But when people make up stories that I don't want to be what I am it hurts me... It's a problem for me that I can't control."<ref name="Oprah1" /> Jackson also responded to tabloid rumors about the amount of [[plastic surgery]] he had had done, saying that he's had "Very, very little. I mean you can count on my two fingers," and furthermore said that "I've never had my cheekbones done, never had my eyes done, never had my lips done and all this stuff, they just go too far."<ref name="Oprah1" />  Further, Jackson wrote in his 1988 autobiography ''Moon Walk'' that he only had two [[rhinoplasty|rhinoplastic surgeries]] and the surgical creation of a cleft in his chin, while attributing the noticeable change in the structure of his face to puberty and diet.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=Michael |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Moonwalk |year= 1988|publisher=Doubleday |location= |id=ISBN 0-434-37042-8 }}</ref>

===Child molestation charges===
{{main|1993 child molestation allegations against Michael Jackson|People v. Jackson}}
[[Image:Michael-jackson-mugshot.jpg|thumb|[[Mug shot]] of Michael Jackson after his arrest in 2003]]
Jackson was reported to be allowing children to sleepover at his Neverland ranch. This practice came under much media and public scrutiny, in 1993, when [[1993 child molestation allegations against Michael Jackson|allegations of child molestation]] were brought against Jackson by a child who had stayed with him on several occasions. That year, Jordan Chandler, the son of former [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] [[Dentistry|dentist]] Evan Chandler, represented by [[civil law (common law)|civil lawyer]] Larry Feldman, accused Jackson of [[child sexual abuse]]. On [[December 22]], Jackson responded to the allegations via satellite from his Neverland compound and claimed to be "totally innocent of any wrongdoing". To avoid court, on [[January 25]] [[1994]], Jackson settled out of court with the accuser for an undisclosed sum, reported to be [[United States dollar|US$]]20 million. The family dropped the charges.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/24/newsid_2512000/2512077.stm |title=1993: Michael Jackson accused of child abuse |accessdate=2006-11-11 |format= |work=BBC On This Day: 24th August |date=[[February 8]] [[2003]] }}</ref>

On [[December 18]] [[2003]], Jackson was charged with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of [[Alcoholic beverage#Legal considerations|administering an intoxicating agent]] in order to commit that felony, all regarding the same boy, ([[Gavin Arvizo]]), under 14. The [[felony]] [[complaint]] stated that Jackson had committed seven lewd acts and two acts of administration of an intoxicating agent to enable the former accusations. Jackson denied these allegations, saying that the [[sleepover]]s were in no way sexual in nature. Jackson's friend, [[Elizabeth Taylor]], defended him on [[Larry King Live]], saying that she had been there when they "were in the bed, watching television. There was nothing abnormal about it. There was no touchy-feely going on. We laughed like children, and we watched a lot of Walt Disney. There was nothing odd about it."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0605/30/lkl.01.html |title=Elizabeth Taylor defends Michael on Larry King Live |accessdate=2006-11-11 |format= |work= |date=}}</ref>

The [[People v. Jackson]] trial began in [[Santa Maria, California|Santa Maria]], [[California]], on [[January 31]], [[2005]], and lasted until the end of May 2005, with Jackson being acquitted on all counts in June. It was one of the largest and most documented trials in world history. About 2,200 media credentials to over 30 news organizations from around the world were issued to cover the trial, more than what was given for the trials of [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O. J. Simpson]] and [[Scott Peterson]] combined.<ref name=USATODAY>{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-06-11-jackson-media-circus_x.htm |title=Tent city: 2,200 media credentials for Jackson trial |accessdate=2007-03-24 |format= |work=usatoday.com }}</ref> Jackson's popularity outside the United States ensured a distinctly international crowd of reporters.<ref name=USATODAY>{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-06-11-jackson-media-circus_x.htm |title=Tent city: 2,200 media credentials for Jackson trial |accessdate=2007-03-24 |format= |work=usatoday.com }}</ref> On top of the media, Santa Maria was also flooded with Jackson fans, 1,200 of whom heard and celebrated the ten not guilty verdicts right outside the courthouse.<ref name=MSNBC>{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8207792/|title=Fans celebrate after Jackson acquittal |accessdate=2007-03-24 |format= |work=msnbc.msn.com }}</ref> 

The [[District Attorney]] of [[Santa Barbara County]] in [[California]], [[Tom Sneddon]], has led two efforts against Jackson involving child molestation.<ref name=CBSNews1>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/12/17/earlyshow/leisure/main589094.shtml|title=Who Is Tom Sneddon? |accessdate=2007-05-29 |format= |work=cbsnews.com }}</ref> The first incident, in 1993, resulted in no charges and the second, at the end of 2003, culminated in a trial two years later in which Jackson was acquitted on all counts. These repeated prosecutions have led to suggestions that Sneddon was motivated by a "mission" or "vendetta" against Jackson. Although Sneddon has a good track record, evidence to support Jackson's claim is quite strong, he joked about Jackson's greatest hits album being released on the same day as his arrest, called him "Wacko Jacko" and also shouted "we got him, we finally got him" to the world media when he had at the time minimal evidence. <ref>[[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1480542/20031120/jackson_michael.jhtml]]</ref><ref>[[http://mjsfc.com/forum/archive/index.php?t-366.htm]]</ref> <ref>{{cite book |last=Taraborrelli |first=J.
