Inuit, such as the [[Nunatamiut]] ([[Uummarmiut]]) who inhabited the [[Mackenzie River]] delta area, often engaged in common warfare.  The Central Arctic Inuit lacked the population density to engage in warfare. In the 13th century, the Thule culture began arriving in Greenland from what is now Canada. Norse accounts are scant.

The [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] were centred around ocean and river fishing; in the interior of British Columbia, hunter-gatherer and river fishing. In both of these areas the salmon was of chief importance. For the people of the plains, bison hunting was the primary activity. In the [[taiga|subarctic forest]], other species such as the [[moose]] were more important. For peoples near the Great Lakes and [[Saint Lawrence River]], [[Shifting cultivation|shifting agriculture]] was practised, including the raising of [[maize]], [[bean]]s, and [[Squash (plant)|squash]].<ref name="three" /> While for the Inuit, hunting was the primary source of food with [[Pinniped|seals]] the primary component of their diet.<ref name="Searles">{{cite book

Aboriginal people currently work in a variety of occupations and may live outside their ancestral homes. The traditional cultures of their ancestors, shaped by nature, still exert a strong influence on them, from spirituality to political attitudes.<ref name="three" />  National Aboriginal Day is a day of recognition of the cultures and contributions of the First Nations, Inuit and M<U+00E9>tis  peoples of Canada.

First Nations were producing art for thousands of years prior to the arrival of European [[Settler colonialism|settler colonists]] and the eventual establishment of Canada as a [[nation state]]. Like the peoples that produced them, indigenous art traditions spanned territories across North America. Indigenous art traditions are organised by art historians according to cultural, linguistic or regional groups: Northwest Coast, [[Plateau First Nations|Plateau]], [[Plains Indians|Plains]], [[Eastern Woodlands tribes|Eastern Woodlands]], Subarctic, and Arctic.<ref name="art" /> 

Art traditions vary enormously amongst and within these diverse groups. Indigenous art with a focus on portability and the body is distinguished from European traditions and its focus on architecture.  Indigenous visual art may be used conjunction with other arts.  [[Shamanism among Eskimo peoples|Shaman's]] [[Masks among Eskimo peoples|masks]] and rattles are used ceremoniously in dance, storytelling and music.<ref name="art" >{{cite book

It was not until the 1950s and 1960s that indigenous artists such as [[Mungo Martin]], [[Bill Reid]] and [[Norval Morrisseau]] began to publicly renew and re-invent indigenous art traditions. Currently there are indigenous artists practicing in all media in Canada and two indigenous artists, Edward Poitras and [[Rebecca Belmore]] have represented Canada at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1995 and 2005 respectively.<ref name="art" />

The Aboriginal peoples of Canada encompass diverse ethnic groups with their individual musical traditions.  Music is usually social (public) or ceremonial (private). Public, social music may be [[dance music]] accompanied by [[rattle (percussion)|rattle]]s and [[drum]]s. Private, ceremonial music includes vocal songs with accompaniment on [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], used to mark occasions like Midewivin ceremonies and Sun Dances.

Traditionally, Aboriginal peoples used the materials at hand to make their instruments for centuries before Europeans immigrated to Canada.<ref name="second" >{{cite book
