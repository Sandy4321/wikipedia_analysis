The '''Eastgate Clock''' is a [[turret clock]] built above the Eastgate of the [[Chester city walls|ancient walls]] of [[Chester]], north-west England. Although the original gate was Roman, the present gate was built in Georgian times to allow coaches through. However, the clock wasn't added until the [[Victorian era]] to celebrate [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee#Diamond Jubilee for Queen Victoria|diamond jubilee]]. The clock is considered a landmark of Chester, and is the second most photographed [[timepiece]] in the [[United Kingdom]] after the [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster]], popularly known as [[Big Ben]].<ref name="council">{{citation |url=http://www.chester.gov.uk/main.asp?page=917|title=Eastgate Clock|publisher]''[[Chester City Council]]''|accessdate=2006-02-25}}</ref>  Eastgate with its clock is a Grade I [[listed building]].<ref name="images">[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=470243 Images of England], accessed 6 August 2007</ref>  

==History==
===Proposal===

A commemorative structure for the Eastgate was first suggested in 1872, as a memorial of a visit by the [[Prince of Wales]] (future king [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom]]) to open the city's [[town hall]]. However, a lack of funding by [[Chester City Council]] led to the idea being abandoned for 25 years, until the idea was revived as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. The [[Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster|Duke of Westminster]] solicited designs from the eminent [[architect]] [[John Douglas, architect (1830-1911)|John Douglas]], who had designed much of Chester's [[Tudorbethan architecture]].<ref name="council"/>

The proposal was not initially popular; initially, the public preferred either a statue of Queen Victoria for the [[town square]] or a large donation to the [[Queen's Nursing Institute|Queen Victoria's Jubilee Institute for Nurses]]. However, eventually enough support was [[Canvassing|canvassed]] for the committee set up to choose a memorial to accept the clock.

===Construction===

The first design for the clock was for a [[Masonry|stone]] tower on top of the gate. However, the clock would have put several [[ancient lights]] into shadow, violating the tenants' [[Right to Light|right to light]]. As result, the wrought-iron design was chosen. The final design for the clock was chosen in March 1898, almost 2 years after Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee. The iron was produced at the nearby [[Coalbrookdale]] foundries (now the [[Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust|Ironbridge Gorge Museum]]), part of [[Ironbridge]], and forged by a local firm, based in the Chester suburb of [[Handbridge]]. The clock mechanism was built by [[JB Joyce]] of [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]], the oldest tower clock company in the world,<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.northshropshire.co.uk/famous-people/index.htm|title=Warriors and Worthies|publisher=North Shropshire Tourism|accessdate=2006-07-13}}</ref> and donated by Edward Evans-Lloyd, a [[Freedom of the City|freeman of the city]].<ref name="council"/>

===Opening===

The clock was formally unveiled on 27 May 1899, the 80th birthday of Queen Victoria. The clock was initially controversial; some thought that the bright [[red]] and [[gold (colour)|gold]] finish and elaborate iron frame made it too garish, and unsuited to its surroundings.<ref name="council"/>

The clock consists of a cuboid housing with clock faces on every side. The clock faces use [[roman numerals]] and are made of [[frosted glass]], allowing an internal lamp to illuminate the hands at night. The mechanism used an innovative system to house the weights which powered the clock within the small frame, leading to the popular opinion that a smaller, but less accurate, spring mechanism had been employed instead. The [[pendulum]] weighed one [[Imperial units|Imperial]] [[hundredweight]] (112 [[pound (mass)|lb]], 50 [[kilogram|kg]]), in order to protect the pendulum from disturbances due to high winds.<ref>{{citation |title=

The clock required [[week]]ly winding until 1992, when the original wind-up mechanism was replaced by an electric one, to reduce maintenance costs. JB Joyce of Whitchurch are in charge of maintaining the clock, and until the conversion to electricity, sent somebody to wind the clock every week.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.bwpics.co.uk/eastgate.html|title=The Eastgate, Chester|publisher=''B&W Pics''|accessdate=2006-02-25}}</ref>
