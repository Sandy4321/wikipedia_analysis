'''Hurricane Bob''' was a weak [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]] that affected the [[Southeastern United States|southeast United States]] in July 1985. The second tropical storm and first hurricane of the [[1985 Atlantic hurricane season]], the system developed from a [[tropical wave]] on July 21 in the eastern [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Bob began moving east, striking southwestern [[Florida]] as a weak tropical storm. The storm then turned to the north and quickly intensified to hurricane status on July 24. The next day, it made landfall near [[Beaufort, South Carolina]], becoming one of a record-tying six hurricanes to hit the United States during a single season.<ref name="hurdat">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2006|title=Hurdat Data for Tropical Cyclones 1851-2008|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=2006-11-25|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/tracks1851to2008_atl_reanal.html}} See [[HURDAT#How_to_read|''How to read HURDAT'']].</ref> Bob quickly weakened over land, and was absorbed by a frontal [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] over eastern [[West Virginia]] on July 26.

Bob caused $20&nbsp;million in damage and five indirect deaths. In Florida, the storm produced heavy rainfall, peaking at over 20&nbsp;inches (500&nbsp;mm) in [[Everglades City, Florida|Everglades City]]. In most areas, the rainfall was beneficial due to dry conditions that had persisted throughout the year. Damage was minimal in South Carolina, where the hurricane made its final landfall. In Virginia, the storm spawned three [[tornado]]es, one of which destroyed two houses.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Bob 1985 track.png|alt=Track map of hurricane. Track starts in the Gulf of Mexico and crosses Florida before turning north and moving ashore for a final time in South Carolina.}}
The remnants of a [[tropical wave]] entered the eastern [[Gulf of Mexico]] on July 20. An [[low pressure area|area of low pressure]] formed and developed into a tropical depression on July 21<!--, while located 200&nbsp;miles (320&nbsp;km) west-northwest of [[Naples, Florida]]-->. Under weak steering currents, the tropical depression drifted southeast, then turned northeast and later east. Based on reports from [[Hurricane Hunters]], the system intensified into Tropical Storm Bob late on July 22. Bob failed to organize significantly as it tracked east through the Gulf, and made landfall between Naples and [[Fort Myers, Florida]] on July 23 as a 45 mph (70&nbsp;km/h) tropical storm. At the time, most of the [[atmospheric convection|convection]] was concentrated south and east of the center.<ref name="tcr1">{{cite web|author=Miles B. Lawrence|date=August 8, 1995|title=Hurricane Bob Preliminary Report Page 1|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-07-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1985-prelim/bob/prelim01.gif}}</ref>

While moving across Florida, Bob turned to the northeast, then to the north. It subsequently left the peninsula, entering the Atlantic Ocean near [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]] early on July 24. As it moved over the warm waters of the [[Gulf Stream]], it quickly organized and intensified into a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1 hurricane]] while 70&nbsp;miles (115&nbsp;km) east of [[Jacksonville, Florida]].<ref name="tcr1"/> Because it was embedded within the western extension of the [[subtropical ridge]], Bob retained higher-than-average [[atmospheric pressure]]s throughout its lifespan.<ref name="mwr">{{cite web|author=Robert A.

Bob's remnants turned north-northeast, and were absorbed by a frontal [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] over eastern [[West Virginia]] on July 26.<ref name="tcr1"/> An associated area of disturbed weather remained separate from the trough, and continued northeast through the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]].<ref name="rain">{{cite web|author=David Roth|year=2005|title=Rainfall Data for Hurricane Bob|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=2009-07-20|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/bob1985.html}}</ref>

==Preparations==
When Bob was designated a tropical storm, the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued [[gale warning]]s for the [[Florida Keys]] west of [[Craig Key]], and from [[Flamingo, Florida|Flamingo]] to [[Venice, Florida|Venice]]. Gale warnings were later posted for the Atlantic coast of Florida northward through [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]].<ref name="tcr4">{{cite web|author=Miles B.

The hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning after Bob's designation.<ref name="tcr1"/> 

Thousands of residents evacuated coastal areas of South Carolina, many of whom stayed at inland hotels; 850&nbsp;people sought protection in shelters, including 500 at an elementary school in [[Horry County, South Carolina|Horry County]] and 240 in a shelter in the [[Grand Strand]]. In [[Beaufort County, South Carolina|Beaufort County]], city and county offices were closed early and businesses were advised to send their workers home prematurely. Officials in [[Chatham County, Georgia]] evacuated nursing homes on [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Tybee Island]], and encouraged others to leave due to the potential for high tides to isolate the island by cutting off [[U.S. Route 80]].<ref name="scprep">{{Cite news|author=Associated Press|date=July 25, 1985|title=Hurricane Bob Batters Georgia-South Carolina Coast|publisher=''The Post-Standard''|accessdate=2009-07-20|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=20555201&firstvisit=true&currentResult=4&currentPage=10}}</ref>
