A '''dictation machine''' is  a [[sound recording]] device most commonly used to record [[Speech communication|speech]] for later playback or to be typed into print. 

The name "[[Dictaphone]]" is a [[trademark]] of the company of the same name, but has also become a common term for all dictation machines, as a [[genericized trademark]]. Sometimes when the general term rather than the specific company is referred to, the variation "dictophone" is used.

Shortly after [[Thomas Edison]] invented the [[phonograph]], the first device for recording sound, in 1877, he thought that the main use for the new device would be for recording speech in business settings. (Given the low [[audio fidelity]] of earliest versions of the phonograph, recording [[music]] may not have seemed to be a major application.)  Some early phonographs were indeed used this way, but this did not become common until the mass production of reusable [[wax]] cylinders in the late 1880s. The differentiation of office dictation devices from other early phonographs (which commonly had attachments for making one's own recordings) was gradual. The machine marketed by the [[Edison Records]] company was trademarked as the "Ediphone". 

Electric [[microphone]]s generally replaced the strictly acoustical recording methods of earlier dictaphones by the late 1930s. In 1945, the [[SoundScriber]] and [[Gray Audograph]], which cut grooves into a plastic disc, was introduced, and two years later Dictaphone replaced wax cylinders with their [[DictaBelt]] technology, which cut a mechanical groove into a plastic belt instead of into a wax cylinder.  This was later replaced by [[magnetic tape]] recording. While [[reel-to-reel tape]] was used for dictation, the inconvenience of threading tape spools led to development of more convenient formats, notably the [[Compact Cassette]], [[Mini Cassette]], and [[Microcassette]].

[[Image:Olympus Digital Voice Recorder.jpg|thumb|An [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] digital voice recorder]][[Digital dictation]] became possible in the 1990s as falling [[computer memory]] prices made possible pocket-sized [[digital voice recorder]]s that stored sound on computer memory chips, without moving parts. In the 1990s, improvements in [[voice recognition]] technology  began to allow computers to [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribe]] recorded audio dictation into [[text file|text]] form, a task that previously required human secretaries or transcribers.  {{As of|2009}} the technology is not robust enough to replace human transcription in most cases.

Despite the advances in technology, analog media are still widely used in dictation recording for their flexibility, permanence, and robustness.
