'''Publius Vergilius Maro''' ([[October 15]], [[70 BC]] &ndash; [[September 21]], [[19 BC]]), later called '''Virgilius''', and known in [[English language|English]] as '''Virgil''' or '''Vergil''', was an ancient Roman poet, the author of the ''[[Eclogues]]'', the ''[[Georgics]]'' and the ''[[Aeneid]]'', the last being an [[epic poem]] of twelve books that became the [[Roman Empire]]'s [[national epic]]. A fictional depiction of Virgil was [[Dante]]'s guide through [[Hell]] and [[Purgatory]] in Dante's epic poem ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''.

==Life==
Virgil was born in  the village of Andes, near [[Mantua]] in [[Cisalpine Gaul]] (Gaul south of the [[Alps]]; present-day northern [[Italy]]). Virgil was of [[Celt|Celtic]] and non-Roman Italian ancestry. 

===Early works===
Virgil received his earliest education at 5 years old. He later went to [[Rome]] to study [[rhetoric]], [[medicine]], and [[astronomy]], which he soon abandoned for [[philosophy]]. In this period, while Virgil was in the school of [[Siro the Epicurean]], he began writing poetry. A group of minor poems attributed to the youthful Virgil survive, but are largely considered spurious. One, the ''Catalepton'', consists of fourteen short poems, some of which may be Virgil's, and another, a short narrative poem titled the ''Culex'' (the [[mosquito]]), was attributed to Virgil as early as the [[1st century]] AD. These dubious poems are sometimes referred to as the ''[[Appendix Vergiliana]]''.

In [[42 BC]], after the defeat of [[Julius Caesar]]'s assassins, [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]], the demobilized soldiers of the victors settled on expropriated land and Virgil's estate near [[Mantua]] was confiscated. Virgil explores the various emotions surrounding these appropriations and other aspects of rural life in the ''[[Eclogues]],'' his earliest poetry first published in the mid-30's BC. A number of the eclogues, notably the second, but also the third, the fifth, the seventh and the tenth, touch on the topic of love between males, often of a [[pederasty|pederastic]] nature. Ancient writers assumed that the character of Corydon in the second eclogue, lover of Alexis, represented Virgil himself, and Alexis represented Alexander, a slave given to Virgil by Pollio. The theme of pederastic love was later also taken up in his epic poem in the story of Nisus and Euryalus. Modern scholars largely reject the effort to seek to identify him with characters in his poetry and thus to garner further biographical details from his own life.

Virgil soon became part of the circle of [[Maecenas]], Octavian's capable ''agent d'affaires'' who sought to counter sympathy for [[Mark Antony]] among the leading families by rallying Roman literary figures to Octavian's side. He gained many connections with other leading literary figures of the time, including [[Horace]] and [[Varius Rufus]] (who later helped finish the Aeneid). After the ''[[Eclogues]]'' were completed, Virgil spent the years [[37 BC]]&ndash;[[29 BC]] on the ''[[Georgics]]'' ("On Farming"), which was written in honor of Maecenas, and is the source of the expression [[tempus fugit]] ("time flies"). 
However, Octavian, who had defeated Antony at the [[Battle of Actium]] in [[31 BC]] and upon whom the title "Augustus" had been bestowed four years later by the [[Roman Senate]], was already pressing Virgil to write an epic to praise his regime.

===Composition of the ''Aeneid'' and death===

Virgil responded with the ''Aeneid'', the writing of which took up the last ten years of his life. The first six books of the epic tell how the [[Troy|Trojan]] hero [[Aeneas]] escapes from the sacking of [[Troy]] and makes his way to Italy. On the voyage, a storm drives him to the coast of [[Carthage]], where the queen, [[Dido]], welcomes him, and under the influence of the gods falls deeply in love with him. [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] recalls Aeneas to his duty, however, and he slips away from Carthage, leaving Dido to commit [[suicide]], cursing Aeneas as revenge. On reaching [[Cumae]], in Italy, Aeneas consults the [[Cumaean Sibyl]], who conducts him through the [[Underworld]] and reveals his destiny to him. Aeneas is reborn as the creator of Imperial Rome.

The first six books (of "first writing") are modeled on [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', but the last six are the Roman answer to the ''[[Iliad]]''. Aeneas is betrothed to [[Lavinia]], daughter of King [[Latinus]], but Lavinia had already been promised to [[Turnus]], the king of the Rutulians, who is roused to war by the [[Erinyes|Fury]] [[Allecto]]. The ''Aeneid'' ends with a single combat between Aeneas and Turnus, whom Aeneas defeats and kills, spurning his plea for mercy. 

Virgil traveled with Augustus to [[Greece]]. En route, Virgil caught a fever, from which he died in [[Brundisium]] harbor, leaving the ''Aeneid'' unfinished. Augustus ordered Virgil's literary executors, [[Lucius Varius Rufus]] and [[Plotius Tucca]], to disregard Virgil's own wish that the poem be burned, instead ordering it published with as few editorial changes as possible. As a result, the text of the ''Aeneid'' that exists may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication. However, the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished (i.e., not a complete line of [[dactylic hexameter]]). Other alleged "imperfections" are subject to scholarly debate.

Incomplete or not, the ''Aeneid'' was immediately recognized as a masterpiece. It proclaimed the imperial mission of the [[Roman Empire]], but at the same time could pity Rome's victims and feel their grief. Dido and Turnus, who are both casualties of Rome's destiny, are more attractive figures than Aeneas, whose single-minded devotion to his goal may seem almost repellent to the modern reader. However, at the time Aeneas was considered to exemplify virtue and ''pietas'' (roughly translated as ''[[piety]]'', though the word is far more complex and has a sense of being duty-bound and respectful of divine will, family and homeland). Nevertheless, Aeneas struggles between doing what he wants to do as a man, and doing what he must as a virtuous hero. In the view of some modern critics, Aeneas' inner turmoil and shortcomings make him a more realistic character than the heroes of [[Homer|Homeric poetry]], such as [[Odysseus]].

==Later views of Virgil==
Even as the Roman world collapsed, literate men acknowledged that the Christianized Virgil was a master poet, even when they ceased to read him. [[Gregory of Tours]] read Virgil and some other Latin poets, though he cautions us that "We ought not to relate their lying fables, lest we fall under sentence of eternal death." Surviving medieval collections of manuscripts containing Virgil's works include the [[Vergilius Augusteus]], the [[Vergilius Vaticanus]] and the [[Vergilius Romanus]].

[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] made Virgil his guide to [[Hell]] and [[Purgatory]] in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''. Dante also mentions Virgil in ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', along with [[Ovid]], [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]] and [[Statius]] as one of the four ''regulati poetae'' (ii, vi, 7).

Virgil is still considered one of the greatest of the Latin poets, and the ''Aeneid'' is a fixture of most classical studies programs.

===Mysticism and hidden meanings===
[[Image:RomanVirgilFolio014rVergilPortrait.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A [[5th century]] portrait of Virgil from the [[Vergilius Romanus]].]]
In the [[Middle Ages]], Virgil was considered a herald of [[Christianity]] for his ''Eclogue 4'' verses ({{perseus|Verg.|Ecl.|4}}) concerning the birth of a boy, which were read as a prophecy of [[Jesus]]' nativity. The poem may actually refer to the pregnancy of Octavian's wife [[Scribonia]], who in fact gave birth to a girl.

Also during the Middle Ages, as Virgil was developed into a kind of [[magus]], manuscripts of the ''Aeneid'' were used for [[divination|divinatory]] [[bibliomancy]], the ''[[Sortes Virgilianae]]'', in which a line would be selected at random and interpreted in the context of a current situation (Compare the ancient Chinese [[I Ching]]). The Old Testament was sometimes used for similar arcane purposes. Even in the [[Welsh mythology|Welsh myth]] of [[Taliesin]], the goddess [[Cerridwen]] is reading from the "Book of Pheryllt"&mdash;that is, Virgil.

In some legends, such as ''[[Virgilius the Sorcerer]]'', the powers attributed to Virgil were far more extensive.

====Virgil's tomb====
The tomb known as "[[Virgil's tomb]]" is found at the entrance of an ancient Roman tunnel (also known as "grotta vecchia") in the Parco di Virgilio in [[Piedigrotta]], a district two miles from old [[Naples]], near the [[Mergellina]] harbor, on the road heading north along the coast to [[Pozzuoli]]. The site called Parco Virgiliano is some distance further north along the coast. While Virgil was already the object of literary admiration and veneration before his death, in the following centuries his name became associated with miraculous powers, his tomb the destination of pilgrimages and pagan veneration. The poet himself was said to have created the cave with the fierce power of his intense gaze.

It is said that the Chiesa della Santa Maria di Piedigrotta was erected by Church authorities to neutralize this pagan adoration and "[[Christianization|Christianize]]" the site. The tomb, however, is a tourist attraction, and still sports a tripod burner originally dedicated to [[Apollo]], bearing witness to the Pagan beliefs held by Virgil.

==Virgil's name in English==
In the [[Middle Ages]] "Vergilius" was frequently spelled "Virgilius." There are two explanations commonly given for the alteration in the spelling of Virgil's name. One explanation is based on a false etymology associated with the word ''virgo'' (''maiden'' in [[Latin]]) due to Virgil's excessively "maiden"-like (''parthenias'' or <U+03C0><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03B8><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03B1><U+03C2> in [[Greek language|Greek]]) modesty.  Alternatively, some argue that "Vergilius" was altered to "Virgilius" by analogy with the Latin ''virga'' (wand) due to the magical or prophetic powers attributed to Virgil in the Middle Ages.  In an attempt to reconcile his pagan background with the high regard in which medieval scholars held him, it was posited that some of his works metaphorically foretold the coming of [[Christ]], hence making him a prophet of sorts. This view is defended by some scholars today, namely Richard F. Thomas of Harvard.

In [[Normans|Norman]] schools (following the [[French language|French]] practice), the habit was to anglicize Latin names by dropping their Latin endings, hence "Virgil."

In the [[19th century]], some [[German language|German]]-trained [[classics|classicists]] in the [[United States]] suggested modification to "Vergil," as it is closer to his original name, and is also the traditional German spelling. Modern usage permits both, though the [[Oxford Style Manual]] recommends ''Vergilius'' to avoid confusion with the 8th-century [[Ireland|Irish]] grammarian [[Virgilius Maro Grammaticus]].

Some post-[[Renaissance]] writers liked to affect the [[sobriquet]] "The Swan of Mantua."
