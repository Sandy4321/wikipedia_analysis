Generally, British colonial-era documents spelled the state's name as '''Johore'''. The modern English-speaking world has since adopted the official spelling of the state in documentary references to the state. See Hack, Rettig, ''Colonial armies in Southeast Asia'', pg 262|group=fn}} He was also informally known as "The Father of Modern Johor", as many historians accredited Johor's development in the 19th century to Abu Bakar's leadership. He initiated policies and provided aids to ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs to stimulate the development of the state's agricultural economy which was founded by Chinese migrants from [[Southern China]] in the 1840s.<ref>[http://www.jb-tionghua.org.my/introduction/introduction5.htm <U+FF08><U+4E94><U+FF09><U+9648><U+65ED><U+5E74><U+4E0E><U+67D4><U+4F5B><U+65B0><U+5C71>], <U+65B0><U+5C71><U+4E2D><U+534E><U+516C><U+4F1A> (Johor Chinese Association), retrieved 28 April 2009</ref> He also took charge of the development of Johor's infrastructure, administrative system, military and civil service, all of which were modelled closely along Western lines.<ref name="Andaya152"/>

Abu Bakar was noted for his diplomatic skills, and British and the Malay rulers had approached him for advice in making important decisions. He was also an avid traveller, and became the first Malay ruler to travel to Europe during his first visit to England in 1866. In particular, Abu Bakar became a lifetime friend of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in his later years. Abu Bakar's friendship with Queen Victoria played an important role in shaping Johor's relationships with Britain, and was the only state by the end of the 19th century in the [[Peninsular Malaysia|Peninsular Malaya]] to maintain [[autonomy]] in its internal affairs as the British Colonial Government pushed for greater control over the [[Malay states]] by placing a [[Resident (title)|British Resident]] in the states. He was also an [[Anglophilia|Anglophile]], and many of his personal habits and decisions were aligned to European ideas and tastes.

Abu Bakar became the soverign ruler of Johor when his father, Temenggong Daing Ibrahim died in 1862. Six years later, Abu Bakar changed his legal state [[title]] of "[[Temenggong]]" to "[[Maharaja]]". In 1885, Abu Bakar sought legal recognition from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] for another change in his legal state title of "Maharaja" to a regnal title of "[[Sultan]]", and was proclaimed the following year. In all, Abu Bakar's [[reign]] lasted for thirty-two years until his death in 1895.<ref>Ismail, Fauziah, [http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/JohorBuzz/Monday/MyJohor/20081214175430/Article/ He is a <U+2018>Datuk<U+2019>... but it<U+2019>s not <U+2018>Sir Shahrukh<U+2019>], [[New Straits Times]], JohorBuzz</ref>

==Early years==

Wan Abu Bakar was born on 3 February 1833 in Teluk Belanga, [[Singapore]]. He was the oldest son Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim, who in turn was a descendant of Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah IV, the first Sultan of Johor's Bendahara dynasty. Abu Bakar spent his childhood years in his father's kampung in Teluk Blanga; at a young age he tutored by local teachers on [[Islam]] and [[Adat]] (traditional Malay law),<ref>Milner, ''The Invention of Politics in Colonial Malaya'', pg 208</ref> before he was sent to the Teluk Blanga Malay school, a mission school run by Reverend Benjamin Peach Keasberry. Under the guidance of the missionary teachers, Abu Bakar was observed to develop the manners of an English gentleman, and the ability to speak fluent English in addition to his native Malay.<ref>Jessy, ''History of Malaya (1400-1959): 1400 - 1959'', pg 225</ref>

In 1851, the Temenggong delegated Abu Bakar, then an eighteen-year old youth, to assist him in negotiation efforts against [[Sultan Ali of Johor|Sultan Ali]], who was making frivolous attempts to claim soverignity rights over Johor.<ref>Winstedt, ''A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941)'', pg 107</ref> As the Temenggong aged, he gradually delegated his state adminsistrative duties to Abu Bakar. During this period, several British officers praised of Abu Bakar's excellent diplomatic skills, as mentioned in William Napier's diaries, who was the senior law agent of Singapore. Napier had accompanied Abu Bakar to fetch Tengku Teh, the mother of the deposed Sultan of Lingga, Mahmud Muzaffar Shah to Johor shortly after her son began to exert soverignity claims over Pahang.<ref name="Winstedt136">Winstedt, ''A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941)'', pg 136</ref>

The outbreak of the Pahang Civil War the following year saw Abu Bakar befriending [[Tun Mutahir of Pahang|Tun Mutahir]], whom he provided support for his war efforts. Abu Bakar married Mutahir's daughter in 1860 during a visit in Pahang, and the following year he signed a treaty of friendship, alliance and a guarantee of mutual support with Mutahir in 1861.<ref>Nadarajah, ''Johore and the Origins of British Control'', pg 20</ref> Meanwhile, Temenggong Ibrahim was already suffering from a prolonged period of ill health, and a bout of high fever resulted in his death on 31 January 1862.<ref>Turnbull, ''The Straits Settlements, 1826-67: Indian Presidency to Crown Colony'', pg 286</ref>

==Administration of Johor==
===Years as Temenggong (1862-1868)===

Abu Bakar assumed office as the Temenggong of Johor within three days of his father's demise. At the time of his succession, Johor was facing a political threat from the deposed Sultan, Mahmud Muzaffar Shah. The Sultan was pursuing his soverignity claims over Johor and Pahang and aimed to overthrow the Sultan of Terengganu with the backing of the Siamese. Mahmud Muzaffar Shah established an alliance with the Wan Ahmad, a brother and arch-rival to the Bendahara Tun Koris. The alliance ignited the concern of Abu Bakar that the fall of Pahang would bring Abu Bakar's political position in Johor under threat. Abu Bakar signed a treaty of friendship with Tun Koris in June 1862,<ref name="Tre153">Tregonning, ''A History of Modern Malaya'', pg 153</ref> and sent a small expeditionary force to aid Wan Ahmad in his war efforts in Pahang when war broke out in August 1862 and much of 1863.<ref>Winstedt, ''A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941)'', pg 117, 121</ref>

Within the first two years of his reign, Abu Bakar began issuing Western-style contracts (termed as ''Surat Sungai'' in Malay, literally "River Documents") to the ''Kapitan Cina'' (Chinese leaders) who have established plantations along river banks in Johor. Letters of auhotisation (''Surat Kuasa'') issued when the first Chinese leaders began settling in Johor during the 1850s. Abu Bakar quickly established goodwill relations with the ''Kapitan Cina''; one Malay administrator who was able to speak the [[Teochew dialect]] (the language spoken by most ''Kapitan Cina'') and read Chinese was employed for these purposes.<ref>Andaya, ''A History of Malaysia'', pg 140</ref> He also employed the service of a Chinese contractor from [[Taishan|Toisan]], Wong Ah Fook, to oversee the construction of [[Istana Besar]].<ref>Lim, ''Wong Ah Fook: Immigrant, Builder and Entrepreneur'', pg 61</ref>

As various Chinese dialect groups began to compete for commercial interests in the 1850s and 1860s which led to communal violence, Abu Bakar the ''Kapitan Cina'' in Johor (who were mainly migrants from [[Chaozhou]]) to assimilate Chinese entrepreneurs of non-Teochew origin. Abu Bakar gave official recognition and support for the Johor branch of the [[Ngee Ann Kongsi]], which was seen as a secret society in Singapore at that time. As Johor prospered from the large revenues generated from the [[gambier]] and [[pepper]] plantations managed by the ''Kapitan Cina'', Abu Bakar gave generous provisions to the ''Kapitan Cina'' in recognition for their contributions to the state; among his beneficiaries was a long-time family friend, Tan Hiok Nee, who was given a seat in the state council.<ref>Lim, ''Wong Ah Fook: Immigrant, Builder and Entrepreneur'', pg 46-7</ref> The plantations operated relatively independently of the state government, and Abu Bakar had raised fears on the possible dangers that the plantations may face in the event of an economic crisis. Shortly after a financial crisis broke out in Singapore in 1864, Abu Bakar implemented a series of regulations on these plantations. The ''Kapitan Cina'' and the Singapore Chamber of Commerce were particularly disturbed by the new regulations, and accused Abu Bakar of attempting to impose a trade monopoly over Johor. The British government pressured Abu Bakar to retract the regulations, which he did so in January 1866. In addition, the ''Kapitan Cina'' also faced considerable difficulties in securing new agreements with Abu Bakar. The crisis was only resolved in 1866 after Abu Bakar designated five new ports for the registration of cargo, and the British softened their animosity against Abu Bakar.<ref>Lim, ''Wong Ah Fook: Immigrant, Builder and Entrepreneur'', pg 81-2</ref>

Abu Bakar relations with the ruler of [[Muar]], [[Sultan Ali of Johor|Sultan Ali]] were strained. Shortly after Abu Bakar took his office from his late father, he sent notice a letter to Sultan Ali to assert Johor's soverignity over Segamat, which Sultan Ali had hoped to exert political influence upon.<ref>Winstedt, ''A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941)'', pg 129</ref> In addition, Sultan Ali, who had borrowed a large sum of money from an Indian moneylender in 1860, became a source of irritation for Abu Bakar. Facing difficulties with paying back his debts to the moneylender, Sultan Ali called upon Abu Bakar to divert the payment of his monthly pension to the moneylender but alternated between recalling back the course of payment to himself and the moneylender. In 1866, when the moneylender lodged a complaint to the British government, Sultan Ali attempted to borrow a sum of money from Abu Bakar to repay his outstanding debts. As a result of these constant irritations, Abu Bakar (by then a Maharaja) persuaded the British governor to sign an agreement the right of power to terminate of payment of Sultan Ali's pension at the agreement of Abu Bakar and the British governor.<ref>Winstedt, ''A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941)'', pg 132</ref>

Abu Bakar made revisions to Johor's Islamic code in 1863 shortly after the Sultan of Terengganu made extensive modifications to his state's Islamic judicial system more closely aligned with those of [[Syariah]] law. In a letter to the Straits Governor, Abu Bakar expressed hope that his revisions would suit more comfortably with European ideas.<ref>Andaya, ''A History of Malaysia'', pg 154</ref> founded an English school in Tanjung Puteri 1864. Two years later, Abu Bakar moved the administrative headquarters to Tanjung Puteri,{{#tag:ref|Tanjung Puteri was renamed Iskandar Puteri in 1855, and to Johor Bahru (the modern name) in 1866. (See Lim, ''Wong Ah Fook: Immigrant, Builder and Entrepreneur'', pg 44.)|group=fn}} and officially renamed it as [[Johor Bahru]].<ref>Winstedt, ''A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941)'', pg 145</ref> A new administration was set up, which was modelled after European styles and certain elements of a traditional Malay government. He recruited some of his close relatives and classmates which he had met during his days at the Teluk Blanga Malay school into the bureaucracy, and also set up an advisory council which included two Chinese leaders. In the early 1870s, the [[Governor of Straits Settlements]], [[Sir]] [[Harry Ord]], mentioned of Abu Bakar (who became a Maharaja in 1868) as the "only Raja in the whole peninsula or adjoining states who rules in accordance with the practice of civilized nations."<ref name="Andaya152">Andaya, ''A History of Malaysia'', pg 152</ref>

===Years as Maharaja (1868-1885)===
[[File:TAbu Bakar.jpg|thumb|left|Abu Bakar in 1866.]]
During a state visit to England in 1866, Abu Bakar was commonly addressed as the "Maharaja" of Johor and led him to realise that the Malay title of ''Temenggong'' which was hardly known to the Western World. He contemplated a change of another title, which led him to send his cousin, Ungku Haji Muhammad and the Dato Bentara, [[Jaafar Haji Muhammad|Dato Jaafar]] to met the Bugis historian, [[Raja Ali Haji]] who was residing in [[Riau]]. Raja Ali supported Abu Bakar's cause, after they did a cross examination and concluded that the past office holders had wielded actual control over the affairs of Johor, rather than the Sultans of the Bendahara dynasty. In addition, questions pertaining to Abu Bakar's pursuits to clamour for recognition were also sidelined as he was able to trace his ancestry to the first Sultan of the Bendahara dynasty, Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah IV by his patrilineal ancestors. The Sultan of [[Lingga]], gave his approval for a formal recognition of Abu Bakar as the Maharaja of Johor, after Ungku Haji and Dato Jaafar travelled to [[Lingga]] and presented their claims. Abu Bakar also secured approval from the Governor of the Straits Settlements for his change in title, and was officially proclaimed as the Maharaja of Johor on 30 June 1868.<ref name="Winstedt124">Winstedt, ''A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941)'', pg 124-5</ref>

Shortly after his proclamation as Maharaja, Abu Bakar laid plans for the construction of a wooden railway between Johor Bahru and Gunung Pulai after some Europeans had raised proposals to set up a retreat and sanatorium. Construction of the railway started in July 1869 and construction of the first phase was completed in 1874, which ran between [[Skudai]] and Johor Bahru. The construction project was later halted after an accident which saw a locomotive falling off the tracks as a result of termite attacks on the wooden tracks within the Skudai portion and a shortage of funds.<ref>Jawahir, Zainoh, [http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/JohorBuzz/Monday/MyJohor/2518224/Article/index_html Abu Bakar gets railway back on track], [[New Straits Times]], JohorBuzz</ref>

In the mid 1870s, the Straits Governor, [[William Jervois]] contemplated on placing Maharaja Abu Bakar as the overlord of the chiefs in [[Negeri Sembilan]] after the British failed to quell the sectarian violence in [[Sungai Ujong]]. Abu Bakar's client, Tunku Antah was placed as the Yam Tuan of the Sri Menanti confederacy (comprising of several small states within the region), and Abu Bakar was made as the adviser of Negeri Sembilan (except Sungai Ujong) in 1878. Abu Bakar was believed to have nursed expansionist ambitions, which was suggested by his involvement in the Pahang Civil War between 1857 and 1864.<ref name="Andaya164">Andaya, ''A History of Malaysia'', pg 164</ref> A later governor, [[Frederick Weld]], aspired for stronger British control over the Malay states and was weary of Abu Bakar's influence. The chiefs were lukewarm to the prospect of Johor's [[sphere of influence]] over Negeri Sembilan, and in 1881 Weld convinced the chiefs within the Sri Menanti confederacy to deal directly with Singapore rather than with Abu Bakar. British officers were also appointed to oversee the affairs in 1883 and 1887, and were gradually given the powers similar to that of a [[British Resident#Residents in (British) Asia|British resident]].<ref>Andaya, ''A History of Malaysia'', pg 165-6</ref>

After [[Sultan Ali of Johor|Sultan Ali's]] death in 1877, the [[Raja Temenggung of Muar|Raja Temenggong of Muar]] and its village chieftains voted in favour of a merger of [[Muar]] with Johor following a succession dispute between two of Sultan Ali's sons. Sultan Ali's oldest son, [[Tengku Alam Shah|Tengku Alam]], disputed the legitimacy of the cheiftains wishes and staked his hereditary claims over Muar. Tengku Alam instigated the 1879 [[Jementah Civil War]] in a bid to reclaim Muar, but was quickly crushed by the Maharaja's forces. During the 1880s, Abu Bakar actively encouraged the Chinese leaders to set up new gambier and pepper plantations in Muar.<ref>Winstedt, ''A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941)'', pg 131-2</ref>

Meanwhile, Weld's continued efforts to keep Abu Bakar's political influence in check and relations between Johor and Singapore became increasingly strained. Abu Bakar was reportedly said to be increasingly reluctant to accept advice from the British-appointed state lawyers, and increasingly turned to his private lawyers which he had employed.<ref>Nadarajah, Johore and the Origins of British Control, pg 32</ref> Weld voiced his intent to place a Resident in Johor, which prompted Abu Bakar to make a trip to England in August 1884 to negotiate new terms with the British Colonial Office. The Assistant Under-Secretary of the Colonial Office, Robert Meade, conceded to Abu Bakar's request for an absence of a British Resident in Johor, although Abu Bakar gave an in-principle acceptance for an British adviser in Johor (though none was appointed until 1914).<ref>Trocki, ''Prince of Pirates: The Temenggongs and the Development of Johor and Singapore, 1784-1885'', pg 185</ref> An agreement was drawn up, and Abu Bakar was promised control over internal affairs in exchange for british control over foreign affarirs pertaining to the state.<ref>Tarling, ''Imperalism in Southeast Asia: A Fleeting, Passing Phase'', pg 88</ref>

===Years as Sultan (1885-1895)===

The Bendahara of Pahang, Wan Ahmad, was proclaimed Sultan in 1881. Abu Bakar, who was weary of the increasingly hostile political environment imposed by Weld, considered the importance of the superior moral authority that was accorded to a "Sultan" than to a "Maharaja".<ref>Lim, ''Wong Ah Fook: Immigrant, Builder and Entrepreneur'', pg 66</ref><ref>Andaya, ''A History of Malaysia'', pg 167</ref> In 1885, Abu Bakar instituted the creation of a state postal and judiciary system modelled along British lines, as well as a military force, the Johor Military Forces ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Askar Timbalan Setia'') upon his return to Johor.<ref name="Reece296"/>

During his stay in [[London]] in late 1885, Abu Bakar expressed his desire to Meade for a formal recognition as the Sultan of Johor. He also met up with [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], who had became a personal friend of Abu Bakar, within the same course of his visit. Queen Victoria consented to his wishes, and a treaty was signed on 11 December 1885 which formalised relations between Great Britain and Johor, was concluded between Abu Bakar and the Colonial Office.<ref name="Reece296">Reece, ''The Name of Brooke: The End of White Rajah Rule in Sarawak'', pg 296</ref> Abu Bakar also founded the state advisory board in London, which was intended to oversee state interests in London. Several retired officers from the Colonial Office, including William Fielding and Cecil Smith were personally appointed by Abu Bakar to oversee the board's administration.<ref>Hooker, ''A Short History of Malaysia'', pg 166</ref>

The formal recognition of the British by Abu Bakar as the Sultan of Johor quickly drew criticisms among the Malays in Johor. A [[pantun]] circulated among the Malays in Johor, which poked jibes at Abu Bakar's background, became very popular. Many Malays were coy on accepting Abu Bakar as their paramount ruler, as they were skeptical of Abu Bakar's [[Temenggong]] political origins and [[Bugis people|Buginese]] heritage.<ref>Winstedt, ''A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941)'', pg 181, 187</ref>{{#tag:ref|Abu Bakar was of Malay (with distant Arab) origins from his [[patriline]]. His patrilineal great-grandfather, Temenggong Abdul Hamid, was the maternal grandson of [[Daeng Parani|Daing Parani]]. Abdul Hamid and his descendants often used the Bugis title "Daing" in their names. Abu Bakar's father, Ibrahim had a Buginese name: Daing Ronggek. (See Trocki, ''Prince of Pirates: The Temenggongs and the Development of Johor and Singapore, 1784-1885'', pg 95)|group=fn}} Furthermore, his affinity with Western culture did not go down well with the culturally-conservative Malays.<ref>Andaya, ''A History of Malaysia'', pg 153</ref> A proclamation ceremony was held on 13 February 1886, whereby Abu Bakar made an official announcement on his adoption of the title "Sultan" in place of "Maharaja".<ref>Singh, ''History of Temples Abroad and in India'', pg 88</ref> In the same year on 31 July, Abu Bakar instituted the first state decorations, ''Darjah Kerabat Yang Amat Dihormati'' (also translated into English as "The Most Esteemed Family Order of Johor") and the ''Seri Paduka Mahkota Johor'' ([[Order of the Crown of Johor]]).<ref>Werlich, ''Orders and Decorations of all Nations: Ancient and Modern, Civil and Military'', pg 220</ref>

Abu Bakar employed the service of a Chinese contractor and long-time acquitance, Wong Ah Fook, to oversee the development of Johor Bahru. The Johor Archives showed that Wong was the largest building contractor at that time and had been involved in at least twenty public works projects between 1887 and 1895. In addition, Wong was contracted to oversee the construction of the [[Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque|state mosque]] and several palaces under the direction of Abu Bakar.<ref>Lim, ''Wong Ah Fook: Immigrant, Builder and Entrepreneur'', pg 70</ref> As a gratitude to Wong's contributions to the state, Abu Bakar granted him a plot of land in the heart of Johor Bahru in 1892. Wong then oversaw the construction of a village, Kampong Ah Fook, as well as a road, [[Jalan Wong Ah Fook]] on the land that he was granted.<ref>Lim, ''Wong Ah Fook: Immigrant, Builder and Entrepreneur'', pg 84</ref>

Abu Bakar promuglated the Johor State Establishment Constitution ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''[[Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor]]'') on 14 April 1895. The state's constitution was seen as a turning point by many as a step in laying the groundwork for the administration of Johor. It was suggested that Abu Bakar, who was fearful of his possible imminet death in light of his failing health,<ref>Nadarajah, ''Johore and the Origins of British Control'', pg 48</ref> promogulated the state constitution with the intent of preserving the state's independence in the light of growing British political influence in the Malay states.<ref>Andaya, ''A History of Malaysia'', pg 199</ref>

==Foreign relations==
===England===
[[File:IstB.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of activities in [[Istana Besar]] in 1882]]
Abu Bakar made his inaurgral state visit while he was still a Temenggong. He toured [[England]] in 1866 with Dato' Jaafar, and met up with members of the English royalty, notably Queen Victoria and the [[Prince of Wales]], [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince Edward]]. The Queen confered Abu Bakar with the [[Order of the Star of India|Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India]] (KCSI), which he valued highly. The trip reportedly gave both Abu Bakar and Dato' Jaafar lasting memories of England, and inspired Abu Bakar to develop Johor along British lines.<ref name="Winstedt124"/> Nine years later, Abu Bakar travelled to [[Calcutta]] to meet up with [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince Edward]] who was then spending his time in the city. The following year, Prince Edward conferred Abu Bakar the Prince of Wales's Gold medal. He made another trip to London in 1878, where he was invited to attend the State Ball at [[Buckingham Palace]]. Abu Bakar's palaces were modelled closely along British lines; when [[George V of the United Kingdom|Prince George]] and [[Prince Albert Victor]] visited Johor in the 1880s, they had commented that the huge drawing room of Abu Bakar's palace closely resembled the state-rooms found at [[Windsor Castle]]. He was also an avid [[polo]] player, and had raced with the princes during their state visits to Johor. The [[Duke of Sutherland]] also praised Abu Bakar's hospitality during his state visit after he became Sultan, and had reportedly enjoyed the Malay cuisine which the Abu Bakar had served to him.<ref>Winstedt, ''A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941)'', pg 135</ref>

In particular, Queen Victoria became a close friend of Abu Bakar especially during his later years. During a visit to England in February 1891, Abu Bakar was personally received by the Queen, and was invited to dine and stay with the Queen at Windsor Castle. Queen Victoria held Abu Bakar in very high esteem, which she had signed herself off as an "affectionate friend" in a letter to Abu Bakar in Match 1891. Reportedly, Queen Victoria was quoted to have highly valued the silver model [[Albert Memorial]] which Abu Bakar sent to her during her [[Golden Jubilee]] in 1887.<ref name="Winstedt136"/> Shortly before his death in May 1895, Queen Victoria sent her personal physician to attend to Abu Bakar's medical needs, who was by then very ill when he arrived in London.<ref name="Winstedt137"/>

===Other countries===

Abu Bakar visited [[Turkey]] during his European tour in 1866, where he met Sultan [[Abd<U+00FC>laziz]]. The Sultan presented Ruggyyah Hanum, a [[Circassian]] princess to Abu Bakar as a gift. Ruggyyah Hanum married Ungku Abdul Majid, a brother of Abu Bakar after she arrived to Johor, and later remarried Dato Jaafar (whom accompanied Abu Bakar during his 1866 trip) after Ungku Majid's died.<ref>Mehmet, ''Islamic Identity and Development'', pg 28</ref> During his second visit to England in August 1878, Abu Bakar wrote to Colonel Anson from [[South Kensington]] of his wishes to visit European royalties in [[Paris]], [[Vienna]] and [[Italy]]. He visited Paris and Vienna and was given a warm reception by Prince Henry of [[Lichtenstein]] before he returned to Johor. Three years later, he visited [[Prussia]], where he was conferred the Royal Prussian Order of the Crown.<ref>Noor, ''The Other Malaysia: Writings on Malaysia's Subaltern History'', pg 38</ref> He made two separate European tours in 1891 and 1893 with a personal physician by his side, during which he met Emperor [[Francis Joseph]], [[Umberto I of Italy|King Umberto]], [[Pope Leo XIII]] and Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]], and was conferred the awards of Commander of the Cross of Italy, Imperial Order of the Osmans (Turkey) and the Commander of the Cross of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.<ref>Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Malaysian Branch, ''Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society'', pg 179</ref>

In 1881, Abu Bakar also visited [[Java (island)|Java]], which was under [[Netherlands|Dutch]] rule. In the same year, he travelled to [[Hawaii]] and met King [[Kal<U+0101>kaua]], where he conferred the Grand Cross of the Order of Kalakaua I of Hawaii.<ref>Withington, ''The Golden Cloak'', pg 264</ref> Two years later, Abu Bakar visited [[Hong Kong]], [[Shanghai]], [[Beijing]] and [[Japan]], where he was received by the [[Emperor Meiji|Meiji Emperor]]. During his Asian travels, Abu Bakar brought along his adviser, Raja Abdul Rahman<ref>Noor, ''The Other Malaysia: Writings on Malaysia's Subaltern History'', pg 39</ref> and state secretariate, Muhammad Salleh.<ref>Freitag, ''Indian Ocean Migrants and State Formation in Hadhramaut: Reforming the Homeland'', pg 223</ref> The [[Emperor of China]], [[Guangxu Emperor|Guangxu]], bestowed upon him the First Class Order of the Double Dragon for his just treatment to the Chinese in Johor.<ref>Winstedt, ''A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941)'', pg 134</ref>

==Family==

Abu Bakar married his first wife, Engku Chik during his stay in [[Pahang]] in 1857. Abu Bakar was related to Engku Chik by family ties; Engku Chik was the sister of Tun Koris, who was also a brother-in-law to Abu Bakar. Abu Bakar had a daughter with Engku Chik, Tunku Besar Putri.<ref>Trocki, ''Prince of Pirates: The Temenggongs and the Development of Johor and Singapore, 1784-1885'', pg 121</ref> although he had a son, [[Sultan Ibrahim|Tunku Ibrahim]], and a daughter, Tunku Mariam with his second wife Cecilia Catherina Lange, who was the daughter of a [[Danish]] trader, [[Mads Johansen Lange]] and his Chinese wife Nonna Sangnio. Lange met Abu Bakar while she was in Singapore, and adopted the Muslim name of "Zubaidah" after her marriage to Abu Bakar in 1870.<ref>Hanna, ''Bali Profile, pg 538</ref> In 1885, Abu Bakar married a Chinese woman of Cantonese heritage, Wong Ah Gew, with whom he had a daughter, Tunku Azizah. Wong took on the Muslim name of "Fatimah" at her marriage to Abu Bakar, and crowned her as the Sultanah in July 1886. Abu Bakar held Wong in very high esteem, and became Abu Bakar's confidant pertaining to his involvement in state affairs. Wong became a close friend of Abu Bakar's building contractor, Wong Ah Fook as they shared a common [[Chinese surname|surname]] and dialect group. Wong died in 1891.<ref>Lim, ''Wong Ah Fook: Immigrant, Builder and Entrepreneur'', pg 58</ref> During his state visit to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in September 1893, Abu Bakar married his fouth wife, Khadijah Khanum, who was of [[Circassian]] heritage. (Khadijah's sister, Ruggyah, became the wives of Abu Bakar's brother and later the first Menteri Besar of Johor, Dato' Jaafar.) He had a daughter, Tunku Fatimah with Khadijah the following February, who was coronated later coronated as the Sultanah of Johor.<ref>Braginsky, Vladimir, Murtagh, Ben, Harrison, Rachel (FRW), ''The Portrayal of Foreigners in Indonesian and Malay literatures'', pg 137</ref>

==Death==

In early May 1895, Abu Bakar travelled to London together with his son and successor, Tunku Ibrahim (later Sultan Ibrahim) with the hope to mustering support and recognition of his rule. He was by then already very ill and was already suffering from an inflammation of the kidneys for sometime and diagnosed with [[Bright's disease]] (a type of kidney disease).<ref>Noor, ''The Other Malaysia: Writings on Malaysia's Subaltern History'', pg 51</ref> At the onstart of the voyage in early May, he became very weak, and had to be carried abroad a ship in a wheelchair. He reached [[London]] on 10 May, and checked into Bailey's Hotel but was bedridden throughout his remaining days. He was not allowed to receive many visitors, though the [[Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Prince Arthur]] paid two visits. Queen Victoria sent her personal physician, Douglas Powell to attend to his medical news upon receiving news of his illness.<ref name="Winstedt137"/>

Abu Bakar contracted [[pneumonia]] during his stay in the hotel, which led to his demise on the evening of 4 June 1895.<ref name="Winstedt137">Winstedt, ''A History of Johore (1365<U+2013>1941)'', pg 137</ref> His body was then brought back to Johor by an English [[man-of-war]] from [[Penang]]. A state funeral was given to Abu Bakar, and he was laid to rest at the royal mausoleum at [[Makam Mahmoodiah]] on 7 September 1895. His son, Tunku Ibrahim was later installed as the Sultan of Johor in November 1895.<ref>Buckley, ''An Anecdotal History of Old Times in Singapore, from the Foundation of the Settlement Under the Honourable the East India Company, on Feb. 6th, 1819, to the Transfer to the Colonial Office as Part of the Colonial Possessions of the Crown on April 1st, 1867'', pg 45</ref>

==Legacy==

Abu Bakar was often accredited as the "Founder of Modern Johor" ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Bapa Pemodenan Johor'').<ref>Jessy, ''History of Malaya (1400-1959): 1400 - 1959'', pg 225</ref> He established a Western-styled [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic system]] and civil service, and consolidated the state's agricultural economy, which consisted of gambier and pepper plantations headed by Chinese leaders, known as "[[Kangchu]]" in the [[Teochew (dialect)|Teochew dialect]]. The gambier and pepper plantations were first introduced during the 1840s by Chinese immigrants.<ref>Trocki, ''Prince of Pirates: The Temenggongs and the Development of Johor and Singapore, 1784-1885'', pg 102</ref> Often, Abu Bakar was called in by Malay rulers from neighbouring states to provide advise in the event when the rulers had to make important decisions. In particular, he became a close confidante of the Sultan of Pahang, Wan Ahmad in 1887, with whom Abu Bakar had persuaded Sultan Ahmad to accept a British consultant instead of a Resident. The Colonial Government at that time was seeking for greater control over the Malay States and was making vociferous attempts to impose British [[Resident Commissioner|Residents]] into the Malay states.<ref>Andaya, ''A History of Malaysia'', pg 153</ref> The Colonial Government also made a failed attempt to impose a British Resident in Johor in 1885; the state maintained its independence in its internal affairs until 1914.<ref>Turnbull, ''The Straits Settlements, 1826-67: Indian Presidency to Crown Colony'', pg 290</ref>

Abu Bakar was also the first Malay ruler to visit Europe in 1866.<ref>Miller, ''A Short History of Malaysia'', pg 89</ref> He was an [[Anglophilia|Anglophile]], and mingled comfortably with the Europeans. The British governor, Sir Harry Ord had once written to the Secretary of State of Great Britain and described Abu Bakar as an "English gentleman" in his tastes and habits.<ref>Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Malaysian Branch, ''Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society'', pg 181</ref> Abu Bakar had gained his share of critics, especially among the more conservative Malay scholars who were critical of his Western tastes.<ref name="Tre153"/> Abu Bakar's penchant for an extravagant lifestyle and foreign travel resulted in a depleted state treasury at the time of his death in 1895. At least one scholar, Nesalmar Nadarajah, had suggested that Johor's loss of independence in the early 20th century was attributed to this depleted state treasury. In addition, Nadarajah also believed that the loss of Johor's independence was also attributed to Abu Bakar's failure of giving attention to his young son, Tunku Ibrahim, who lacked proper education and training in the art of state administration and diplomacy when he succeeded his father as the Sultan of Johor in his early twenties.<ref>Nadarajah, ''Johore and the Origins of British Control'', pg 188</ref>

Many state's buildings which were constructed during Abu Bakar's reign were modelled after [[Victorian architecture|British Victorian]] and [[Moorish architecture|Moorish architectural]] styles. Abu Bakar placed the construction of these state buildings under close supervision, and was often called in to lay the foundation stones of these buildings personally. A few of these buildings were [[List of places named after Abu Bakar of Johor|named after Abu Bakar]] himself, notably the [[Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque]] ([[Malay language|Malay]]: Masjid Negeri Sultan Abu Bakar), which was built between 1892 and 1900.<ref>Tate, Karim, ''Information Malaysia (2005)'', pg 877</ref>
