'''Jeannette Ridlon Piccard''' ([[January 5]] [[1895]] &ndash; [[May 17]] [[1981]]) was an [[United States|American]] teacher, scientist, priest, and [[aeronautics|aeronaut]] who pioneered [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] flight. A member of the famed [[Piccard]] family of balloonists and of the [[New Mexico Museum of Space History|International Space Hall of Fame]], she was the first licensed female balloon pilot, the first woman to fly to the [[stratosphere]], and a speaker for [[NASA]]. Her 1934 flight held the women's altitude record for three decades. Called a woman of causes and irrepressible, Piccard is remembered as one of the ''Philadelphia Eleven'', the first women to be [[ordination|ordained]] [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] priests.<ref name=Time-JRP /><ref name=Time-Celeb />

==Family and education==
Born in [[Chicago, Illinois]], Piccard was the daughter of Dr. John Ridlon, a noted [[orthopedic surgery|orthopedic]] surgeon at [[Northwestern University]], and Emily Ridlon, who had seven children.<ref name=LOC>{{cite web| author= Manuscript Division, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.| title= The Piccard Family Papers, Register.

A family of boys, the Piccards had three sons, John, Paul and [[Don Piccard|Donald]], as well as foster children. During the 1980s, [[Gene Roddenberry]] most likely named Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Star Trek]]'' for one or both of the twin brothers [[Auguste Piccard]] and Jean Felix Piccard, and derived Jean-Luc from her husband's name.<ref name=UCBerkeley>{{cite web| author= University of California et al.

Piccard made her famous flight in the third and final voyage of the ''Century of Progress'' which she was the only Piccard to fly. The balloon was conceived for the [[Century of Progress|World's Fair]] in 1933, held in Chicago to celebrate the city's centennial. It was the largest balloon in the world, 105 feet wide, and 600,000 cubic feet that took 700 [[hydrogen]] cylinders to fill.<ref name=Navy>{{cite web| author= Unknown author| title= To Leave the Earth| publisher= US Department of the Navy - Navy Historical Center| date= undated| url= http://www.history.navy.mil/download/space-04.PDF| accessdate= 2007-01-26}}</ref>

The Piccard family was more interested in science at high altitudes and in flying for the joy of it than in setting records.<ref name=BalloonLife /><ref name=Goebel /> But competition to reach the [[stratosphere]] by balloon was in full force during the 1920s and 1930s. Auguste Piccard's flights reached 51,783 and 53,152 feet during 1931 and 1932, altitude records soon broken by Prokofiev with Birnbaum and Godunov in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1933.<ref name=FIA>{{cite web| author= F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration A<U+00E9>ronautique Internationale| title= Commission Internationale d'A<U+00E9>rostation (CIA) Notable Flights and Achievements Part 6, 1926-1950| publisher= via Hans <U+00C5>kerstedt and Svenska Ballongfederationen| date= March 2004| url= http://www.ballong.org/peter/jesper/cia/report.php?period=06&title=Part%206,%201926-1950| accessdate= 2007-01-25}}</ref><ref name=Voss>{{cite web| author= Voss, Linda| title= ''Lighter Than Air'', The Race to the Stratosphere| publisher= US Centennial of Flight Commission| date= 2003| url= http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Lighter_than_air/race_to_strato/LTA11.htm| accessdate= 2007-01-26}}</ref>

The [[United States Navy|US Navy]] borrowed the balloon and Lt. Cmdr. Thomas (Tex) G. W.

[[Naval Historical Center]] accounts omit the Piccards,<ref name=Navy /><ref name=Navy-Space /> but the Piccards then owned the ''Century of Progress''. Although the Navy credits the Marines,<ref name=Navy /> it was Jeannette Piccard and thirty or forty men hired by the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] who rescued and dried out the ''Century of Progress'' after the aborted flight spread the balloon across [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Burlington & Quincy]] railroad tracks in downtown Chicago.

The armed forces again decided to use the balloon, and sponsored by the [[Army Air Corps]] and [[National Geographic Society]], Settle with Maj. Chester L.

==Pilot's license==
Jean and Jeannette Piccard planned a flight to the stratosphere, deciding he would concentrate on science and she would be pilot. Piccard studied under Edward J. Hill, a noted balloonist and [[Gordon Bennett Cup]] winner who was based at Ford Airport in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].<ref name=Rechs-Hill>{{cite web| author= Robert Rechs| title= Who's Who of Ballooning - Hes-Hy| date= [[November 21]] [[1983]]| url= http://www.ballooninghistory.com/whoswho/who'swho-h2.html| accessdate= 2007-01-27}}</ref> [[Henry Ford]] wanted them to succeed, provided use of his hangar, and brought [[Wright brothers|Orville Wright]] to observe a flight that year.<ref name=BalloonLife>{{cite web| author= Stekel, Peter| publisher= Balloon Life Magazine| title= Don Piccard - 50 Years of Ballooning Memories| date= August 1997| url= http://www.balloonlife.com/9707/piccard.htm| accessdate= 2007-01-26}}</ref> On [[June 16]] [[1934]], Piccard flew her first solo flight and later that year the [[National Aeronautic Association]] licensed Piccard, making her the first woman spherical balloon pilot.<ref name=Oakes>{{cite web| author= Oakes, Claudia M.| title= United States Women in Aviation: 1930-1939| publisher= Smithsonian Studies in Air and Space| date= 1985| url= http://www.sil.si.edu/smithsoniancontributions/AirSpace/text/SSAS-0006.txt| accessdate= 2007-01-27}}</ref><ref name=LOC />

Ballooning was a dangerous undertaking, partly because human lungs cannot function unaided over something between 40,000 and 50,000 feet, and partly because hydrogen then used as a lifting gas is highly flammable. Hawthorne Gray of the [[United States Army|US Army]] was a skilled balloonist who in 1927 was the first to reach the stratosphere. Gray had tested clothing, instrumentation and oxygen delivery in three flights that year, but he died of [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] when his oxygen ran out during descent. During January of 1934, the crew of Fedoseenko, Vasienko and Usyskin had died in the Soviet Union when their gondola separated from their balloon.<ref name=FIA /> The National Geographic Society refused to back a flight piloted by a mother. Longtime Piccard family backer [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] was reluctant to lend their support to a female pilot. Dow Chemical asked that their trade names and logo be removed from publicity and the ''Century of Progress'' balloon. The Piccards were able to obtain financing from the Grigsby-Grunow radio company, the People's Outfitting Company and Henry Ford who lent his hangar as a launch site.<ref name=Oakes />

==Stratosphere flight==
[[Image:Atmospheric Layers.svg|left|thumb|Piccard reached over 10 miles up into the [[stratosphere]]. NASA technical definitions change. At one point they qualified the ''Century of Progress'' as a ''spacecraft'' and flight over 40,000 feet ''space travel'' and Piccard the ''first woman in space.''

45,000 spectators came to see them go, about two hours behind schedule on [[October 23]] [[1934]], at 6:51 a.m. Piccard piloted Jean Piccard, herself and their pet turtle, Fleur de Lys, in the reconditioned ''Century of Progress''. They lifted off from Ford Airport,<ref name=Oakes /> with help from airmen on the ground who pushed the gondola. They reached 57,579 feet or about 10.9 miles up, travelled eight hours total in a journey over [[Lake Erie]] and landed about 300 miles away from Dearborn near [[Cadiz, Ohio]].

Piccard observed that the liquid oxygen stopped vaporizing as the balloon descended after the cabin doors were opened. Realizing that this would be fatal for a fighter pilot, Jean Piccard analyzed the phenomenon and created the liquid oxygen convertor.<ref name=CFC>{{cite web| author= US Centennial of Flight Commission| title= Jean Piccard| date= 2003| url= http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Dictionary/Jean_Piccard/DI65.htm| accessdate= 2007-01-27}}</ref> Jean Piccard developed a frost-free window, that was used on this flight and later by the Navy and Air Force in the [[B-24 Liberator]] or [[B-26 Marauder]]. Jean Piccard used [[blasting cap]]s and [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] for releasing the balloon at launch and for remote release of external ballast from inside the sealed cabin. This was the first use of [[pyrotechnics]] for remote-controlled actuating devices in [[aircraft]], an unpopular, revolutionary idea at the time. Later [[Robert R.

==Plastic balloons==

In 1935 and 1936, to reduce weight and thus enabling a balloon to reach higher altitudes, [[plastic]] balloon construction began independently by Max Cosyns in Belgium, Eric Regener in Germany, and Thomas H. Johnson and Jean Piccard, then at the [[Franklin Institute]] Bartol Research Foundation in [[Swarthmore, Pennsylvania]]. Johnson suggested [[cellophane]] to Jean Piccard.<ref name=Winker>{{cite web| author= Winker, J. A., via sample page| title= Scientific ballooning, past and present| publisher= American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics| date= 1986| url= http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&gTable=mtgpaper&gID=92979| accessdate= 2007-01-28}}</ref>

Development continued in Swarthmore and began in Minneapolis when the Piccards moved to the University of Minnesota. Jean Piccard designed and in 1936 flew a cellophane balloon built by his students. The balloon was unmanned, 25 feet wide, and made of tapered 33-foot gores and one-inch [[3M]] [[Scotch Tape|Scotch]] transparent tape. Jean Barnhill, Harold Larson and Lloyd Schumacher cut the gores that fit together like an "orange peel." Harold Hatlestad built the radio equipment and Robert Silliman built the telemeter<ref name=Gilruth /> that sent temperature and pressure data back. Photos show Piccard present at the launch. During the flight, Robert Hatch and Silliman maintained radio contact from a station on the roof of the university armory until the radio's battery froze from insufficient insulation.<ref name=AEM-Notable>{{cite web| author= Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics (AEM) Department| publisher= University of Minnesota| title= Some Notable Early Faculty Members| date= [[July 23]] [[2004]]| url= http://www.aem.umn.edu/info/history/03_NotableFaculty.shtml| accessdate= 2007-01-27}}</ref><ref name=Winker /> The balloon floated at 50,000 feet, and in ten hours traveled over 600 miles to near [[Huntsville, Arkansas]].<ref name=Winker />

Piccard is credited with co-inventing the plastic balloon in 1936. The University of Minnesota physics department, now the School of Physics and Astronomy, made a final report on their high altitude research program for the US Navy. The report archived in the university libraries special collection is dedicated on the flyleaf to Jean and Jeannette Piccard as "inventors of the plastic balloon" and signed by the balloon scientists of the day.<ref name=Rechs-JRP>{{cite web| author= Robert Rechs| title= Who's Who of Ballooning - P| date= [[November 21]] [[1983]]| url= http://www.ballooninghistory.com/whoswho/who'swho-p.html| accessdate= 2007-01-27}}</ref>

==Cluster balloons==
Developed with John Ackerman of the University of Minnesota and piloted by Jean Piccard in 1937 in [[Rochester, Minnesota]], the first multi-celled balloon was called ''The Pleiades'' and was made of 98 [[latex (rubber)|latex rubber]] balloons. In a letter to Robert Gray of the Dewey and Almy Chemical Co. later published in ''Time'' magazine, Piccard describes how he broke balloons with a hunting knife and revolver to control his descent. A TNT charge released the cluster as he expected but sent burning [[excelsior (wood wool)|excelsior]] down that destroyed the first ''Pleiades''. He suggested to Gray that [[mineral wool|rock wool]] in place of excelsior would prevent similar accidents in the future.<ref name=Egg-Shell>{{cite web| author= Piccard, Jean via Robert Gray| title= Egg Shell Landing| publisher= Time| date=  [[August 16]] [[1937]]| url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,770771,00.html?promoid=googlep| accessdate= 2007-01-27}}</ref>

In February 1946 with [[Otto C. Winzen]], Jean Piccard proposed manned flight to the US Navy using clustered balloons made of thin plastic. In June the Office of Naval Research approved ''Project Helios'' and that year [[General Mills]] and the University of Minnesota contracted to build a cluster of 100 [[polyethylene]] balloons for atmospheric research.<ref name=Navy-FAQ>{{cite web| author= US Department of the Navy - Navy Historical Center| title= Navy in Space Chronology, 1945 - 1981| date= [[July 24]] [[2003]]| url= http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq124-1.htm| accessdate= 2007-01-27}}</ref> Piccard worked for General Mills<ref name=LOC /> on ''Project Helios'' and invented the reefing sleeve for control of the thin plastic during inflation.

Jean Piccard helped Winzen design the [[Skyhook balloon|Skyhook]] polyethylene balloons that replaced ''Project Helios'' in 1947. Skyhook balloons were used unmanned for atmospheric research by the Navy and for manned flights by the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]].<ref name=Navy-FAQ /><ref name=BalloonLife /> Later Jean Piccard developed electronics for emptying ballast bags.<ref name=CFC /> Piccard's involvement in these projects is less well documented.

In 1971, one year after the Episcopal Church admitted female [[Deacon#Anglican|deacons]], Piccard was ordained a deacon, and in 1974, under remarkable circumstances, she was ordained a priest. In [[Philadelphia]] at the Church of the Advocate, three retired bishops &ndash; Daniel Corrigan, former church head of domestic missions, Robert L. De Witt of the [[diocese]] [[Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania|of Pennsylvania]], and Edward Randolph Welles II of the diocese of West Missouri &ndash; ordained eleven women priests, cheered by a large congregation. A fourth bishop, Jos<U+00E9> Antonio Ramos of [[Costa Rica]], was there but was out of his jurisdiction. All eleven women risked suspension as deacons and the four bishops "could be suspended or deposed by a church trial court" for ignoring a church canon prohibiting retired bishops from performing "episcopal acts" unless asked by a local bishop. Five Episcopal priests objected at the point in the service when Corrigan asked if there was "any impediment" to the ordinations, one calling the ordinations perversions and one calling them unlawful and "schismatical."<ref name=Time-Rebel>{{cite web| author= ''Time''| title= The Women's Rebellion| date= [[August 12]] [[1974]]| url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908650,00.html| accessdate= 2007-01-29}}</ref>

Another of the group, who were known as ''irregulars'' and sometimes called the ''Philadelphia Eleven'', Carter Heyward became the 1974 [[Ms. magazine|''Ms.'']] magazine Woman of the Year. Suzanne Hiatt later said, "In retrospect, to have been ordained 'irregularly' is the only way for women to have done it.<ref name=AWTS /> Cheek, Heyward and Piccard joined in a consecration and Piccard gave the absolution in a celebration of the [[eucharist]] at Riverside Church in Manhattan in November. Philip McNairy of the diocese [[Episcopal Diocese of Minnesota|of Minnesota]] who wanted women in the priesthood was concerned that the eleven were hurting the cause of the other women deacons, who numbered over one hundred at the time.<ref name=Time-Celeb>{{cite web| author= ''Time''| title= Celebration of Defiance| date= [[November 11]] [[1974]]| url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911521,00.html| accessdate= 2007-02-01}}</ref>

John M. Allin of Mississippi, the new presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, which had 3.1 million members at the time, called an emergency meeting of the [[House of Bishops]] in Chicago.<ref name=Time-Rebel /> Harold B. Robinson, diocese of Western New York, and two colleagues set in motion charges accusing the three bishops of breaking their vows and violating church laws. They withdrew charges when the House of Bishops, in a carefully worded resolution that passed 129 to 9 with 8 abstensions, challenged the ordinations, decried the bishops' actions, calling them understandable but "wrong."<ref name=Time-House>{{cite web| author= ''Time''| title= The Women Priests| date= [[August 26]] [[1974]]| url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944969,00.html| accessdate= 2007-02-01}}</ref> But the church was moving in this direction already, and the [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] of 1976 voted to open the priesthood to women.<ref name=AWTS>{{cite web| author= McCurdy, Claire, Leslie Reyman, and Letitia Campbell| title= Processing the Papers of Women Religious Figures: The Archives of Women in Theological Scholarship (AWTS) Project| publisher= ''Annotation'' (Vol. 30:1  ISSN 0160-8460) The Newsletter of the National Historical Publications and Records Commission| date= March 2002| url= http://www.archives.gov/nhprc/annotation/march-2002/women-theological-scholarship.html| accessdate= 2007-01-26}}</ref>
