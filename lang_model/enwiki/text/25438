'''Keswick''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|k|<U+025B>|z|<U+0268>|k}} {{respell|KEZ|ik}}) is an English [[market town]] and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] within the [[Allerdale|Borough of Allerdale]] in [[Cumbria]], [[Historic counties of England|historically]] in [[Cumberland]]. It has a population of slightly below 5,000. The town is situated just north of [[Derwentwater]], and {{convert|4|mi|km}} from [[Bassenthwaite Lake|Bassenthwaite]], both in the [[Lake District National Park]].

There is considerable evidence of prehistoric occupation of the Keswick area, but the first recorded mention of the town dates from the 13th century, when [[Edward I of England]] granted a charter for Keswick's market, which has maintained a continuous 700-year existence. In [[Tudor period|Tudor]] times the town was an important mining area, and from the 18th century onwards it has increasingly been known as a holiday centre; tourism has been its principal industry for more than 150 years. Its features include [[The Moot Hall]]; a modern theatre, [[Theatre by the Lake]]; one of Britain's oldest surviving cinemas, the Alhambra; and the [[Keswick Museum and Art Gallery]] in the town's largest open space, [[Fitz Park]]. Among the town's annual events is the [[Keswick Convention]], an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] gathering attracting visitors from many countries.

Keswick became widely known for its association with the poets [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Robert Southey]]. Together with their fellow [[Lake Poets|Lake Poet]] [[William Wordsworth]], based at Grasmere, {{convert|12|mi|km}} away, they made the scenic beauty of the area widely known to readers in Britain and beyond. In the late 19th century and into the 20th, Keswick was the focus of several important initiatives by the growing conservation movement often led by [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], vicar of the nearby [[Crosthwaite]] parish and co-founder of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], which has built up extensive holdings in the area.

==Name==
The town is first recorded in Edward I's charter of the 13th century, as "Kesewik".<ref name=ml/> Scholars have generally considered the name to be from the [[Old English]], meaning "farm where cheese is made", the word deriving from "c<U+0113>se" (cheese) with a Scandinavian initial "k" and "w<U+012B>c" (special place or dwelling), although not all academics agree. [[George T. Flom|George Flom]] of the [[University of Illinois]] (1919) rejected that derivation on the grounds that a town in the heart of [[Vikings|Viking]]-settled areas, as Keswick was, would not have been given a [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Saxon]] name; he proposed instead that the word is of Danish or [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Norse]] origin, and means "Kell's place at the bend of the river".<ref>Flom, George T. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/27713787 "The Origin of the Place-Name 'Keswick'"], ''The Journal of English and Germanic Philology'', Volume 18/2 (April 1919), pp. 221<U+2013>225 {{subscription}}</ref> Among the later scholars supporting the "cheese farm" toponymy are [[Eilert Ekwall]] (1960) and A D Mills (2011), both for the [[Oxford University Press]], and Diana Whaley (2006), for the [[English Place-Name Society]].<ref>Ekwall, p. 273; and Mills, A D.

==Prehistory==
[[File:Castlerigg Stone Circle.JPG|thumb|upright|Stone circle at Castlerigg]]
There is clear evidence of the presence of prehistoric man in the area. The [[Castlerigg stone circle]] on the eastern fringe of the town has been dated to between 3000 and 2500 [[Anno Domini|BC]].<ref name=b2>Bott, p. 2</ref> [[Neolithic]]-era stone tools were unearthed inside the circle and in the centre of Keswick during the 19th century. The antiquary [[W. G. Collingwood|W G Collingwood]], commenting on finds in the area, wrote that they showed "Stone Age man was fairly at home in the Lake District".<ref>Collingwood, p. 6</ref> There is little evidence of sustained settlement in the area during the [[Bronze Age]], but from excavations of [[hill fort]]s it is clear that there was some [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] occupation, circa 500 BC, although scholars are not agreed about how permanent it was.<ref>Bott, p. 3</ref>

In [[Roman Britain]] Cumbria, as the site of the western part of [[Hadrian's Wall]], was of strategic importance. The north of the county is rich in archaeological evidence from the period, but nothing is known that suggests any Roman habitation in the Keswick area, other than finds that point to the existence of one or more Roman highways passing the vicinity of the present-day town.<ref>Rice, p. 92; and Bott, p. 4</ref> Such nearby settlements as can be traced from the era of the Romans and the years after their departure seem to have been predominantly [[Celts|Celtic]]. Many local place names from the period, including that of the [[River Derwent, Cumbria|River Derwent]], are Celtic, some closely related to Welsh equivalents.{{#tag:ref|"Derwent" derives from "derv<U+0101>", meaning "river where oaks are common", which Ekwall compares with the Welsh "derw".<ref>Ekwall, p. 143</ref>|group= n}}

The last major influences on the area before reliable historical records began were the Christian saints who preached the [[The gospel|Gospel]] in the north of England in the late 6th and early 7th centuries [[Anno Domini|AD]]. In Keswick and the surrounding area the most important figures were [[Herbert of Derwentwater|St Herbert of Derwentwater]] and his contemporary [[Saint Mungo|St Kentigern]].<ref name=b4>Bott, pp. 4<U+2013>5</ref> The former, the pupil and friend of [[Cuthbert|St Cuthbert of Lindisfarne]], lived as a hermit on an island in Derwentwater, now named after him.<ref name=b4/> Kentigern, who lived and preached in the area before moving on to Wales, is traditionally held to have founded [[Crosthwaite Parish Church|Crosthwaite Church]], which was the parish church of Keswick until the 19th century.<ref>Wilson and Kaye, pp. 5<U+2013>6</ref>

==History==

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Keswick Saturday Market, Cumbria - June 2009.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Keswick's market has an unbroken history of more than 700 years.]]
Keswick's recorded history starts in the [[Middle Ages]]. The area was part of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] until about 1018, after which it was briefly absorbed by the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] until 1092.<ref>Haywood, p. 104</ref> In that year [[William II of England]], son of [[William the Conqueror]], marched north and established lasting [[Normans|Norman]] rule in Cumbria. So far as concerns the history of Keswick, William's most important act was establishing the great baronies of Allerdale-below-Derwent, Allerdale-above-Derwent, and Greystoke, the borders of which met at Keswick.<ref name=b11>Bott, p. 11</ref> In 1181 [[Jocelyn of Furness]] wrote of a new [[Crosthwaite Parish Church|church at Crosthwaite]], Keswick, founded by Alice de Romilly, the Lady of Allerdale, a direct descendant of William II's original barons.<ref name=w8>Wilson and Kaye, p. 8</ref> In 1189, [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] granted the rectory of Crosthwaite to the [[Cistercian]] order of [[Fountains Abbey]].<ref>Rice, p. 103</ref>

During the 13th century, agricultural land around the town was acquired by Fountains and [[Furness Abbey|Furness]] Abbeys. The latter, already prosperous from the wool trade, wished to expand its sheep farming, and in 1208 bought large tracts of land from Alice de Romilly. She also negotiated with Fountains Abbey, to which she sold [[Derwent Island]] in Derwentwater, land at [[Watendlath]], the mill at [[Crosthwaite]] and other land in [[Borrowdale]]. Keswick was at the hub of the monastic farms in the area, and Fountains based a steward in the town, where tenants paid their rents.<ref name=b11/> Furness also enjoyed profitable rights to the extraction of iron ore.<ref>Rice, p. 95</ref>

{{Quote box |bgcolor=#FDF0F0 |salign=right| quote = Grant to Thomas de Derwentewatere, and his heirs, of a weekly market on Saturday at Kesewik in Derewentfelles, co. Cumberland, and of a yearly fair there on the vigil, the feast and the morrow of St. Mary Magdalene, and the two days following.| source = Grant by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], 18 July 1276<ref name=ml>Maxwell Lyte ''et al'', p. 200</ref>|align=right| width=45%}} Keswick was granted a charter for a market in 1276 by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]. This market has an uninterrupted history lasting for more than 700 years.<ref>[http://www.visitcumbria.com/kes/keswick/ "Keswick"] Visit Cumbria, retrieved 29 August 2014</ref> The pattern of buildings around the market square remained broadly the same from this period until at least the late 18th century, with houses <U+2013> originally timber-framed <U+2013> fronting the square, and sturdily-enclosed gardens or yards at the back. According to local tradition these stout walls and the narrow entrances to the yards were for defence against marauding Scots. In the event it appears that the town escaped such attacks, with Scottish raiders finding richer and more accessible targets at [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] and the fertile [[River Eden, Cumbria|Eden Valley]], well to the north of Keswick.<ref>Bott, pp. 12<U+2013>13</ref>

===16th and 17th centuries: agriculture and industry===
[[File:Sorting-copper-ore-16th-century.jpg|thumb|German miners sorting ore, 16th century]]
With the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution of the monasteries]], between 1536 and 1541, Furness and Fountains Abbeys were supplanted by new secular landlords for the farmers of Keswick and its neighbourhood. The buying and selling of sheep and wool was no longer centred on the great Abbeys, but was handled locally by the new landowners and tenants. This enhanced Keswick's importance as a market centre, though at first the town remained only modestly prosperous: in the 1530s [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] wrote of it as "a lytle poore market town".<ref>Linton, p. 58</ref> By the second half of the century copper mining had made Keswick richer: in 1586 [[William Camden]] wrote of "these copper works not only being sufficient for all England, but great quantities of the copper exported every year" with, at the centre, "Keswicke, a small market town, many years famous for the copper works as appears from a charter of king [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], and at present inhabited by miners."<ref>Camden, p. 170</ref>

Earlier copper mining had been small in scale, but [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], concerned for the defence of her kingdom, required large quantities of copper for the manufacture of weapons and the strengthening of warships. There was the additional advantage for her that the Crown was entitled to royalties on metals extracted from English land.<ref>Bott, p. 17</ref> The experts in copper mining were German, and Elizabeth secured the services of Daniel Hechstetter of [[Augsburg]], to whom she granted a licence to "search, dig, try, roast and melt all manner of mines and ores of gold, silver, copper and quicksilver" in the Keswick area and elsewhere.<ref>Collingwood, p. 123</ref>

[[File:Moot-hall-plaque.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|Plaque on Keswick's Moot Hall detailing its history from the 16th century]]
As well as copper, a new substance was found, extracted and exploited: this was variously called wad, black lead, plumbago or black cauke, and is now known as [[graphite]]. Many uses were quickly discovered for the mineral: it reduced friction in machinery, made a heat-resistant glaze for crucibles, and when used to line moulds for cannonballs, resulted in rounder, smoother balls that could be fired further by English naval cannon.<ref name=b22>Bott, pp. 22<U+2013>23</ref> Later it was used to make pencils, for which Keswick became famous, but evidently that use did not begin until the late 18th century.<ref name=b22/>

The copper mines prospered for about seventy years, but by the early 17th century the industry was in decline. Demand for copper fell and the cost of extracting it was high.<ref>Collingwood, p. 126</ref> Graphite mining continued, and quarrying for slate began to grow in importance. Other small-scale industries grew up, such as tannery and weaving; although the boom of the mid-16th century had finished, the town's economy did not slide into ruin, and the population remained generally constant at a little under 1,000.<ref>Bott, pp. 28<U+2013>30</ref>

===18th and 19th centuries: beginnings of tourism===
[[File:Loutherbourg-skiddaw-1787.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Coach at the foot of [[Skiddaw]], by [[Philip James de Loutherbourg|de{{space}}Loutherbourg]], 1787]]
The historian George Bott regards [[John Dalton (poet)|John Dalton]] (1709<U+2013>63) and [[John Brown (essayist)|John Brown]] (1715<U+2013>66) as the pioneers of tourism in the Lake District. Both wrote works praising the majesty of the scenery, and their enthusiasm prompted others to visit the area. The poet [[Thomas Gray]] published an account of a five-day stay in Keswick in 1769, in which he described the view of the town as "the vale of Elysium in all its verdure", and was lyrical about the beauties of the fells and the lake.<ref>Gray, p. 325</ref> His journal was widely read, and was, in Bott's phrase, "an effective public relations job for Keswick."<ref name=b39/> Painters such as [[Thomas Smith (English painter)|Thomas Smith of Derby]] and [[William Bellers]] also contributed to the influx of visitors; engravings of their paintings of Cumberland scenery sold in large numbers, further enhancing the fame of the area.<ref name=b39>Bott, p. 39</ref> In 1800 the poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] wrote, "It is no small advantage that for two thirds of the year we are in complete retirement <U+2013> the other third is alive & swarms with Tourists of all shapes & sizes."<ref>Lindopp p. 165</ref> Coleridge had moved to Keswick in that year, and together with his fellow [[Lake Poets]] (see [[Keswick, Cumbria#Lake Poets and other Keswick notables|below]]) was possibly the strongest influence on the public esteem of Keswick and the Lake District.<ref name=lp/>
 
During the 18th century and into the 19th, [[Turnpike trusts]] were established and major roads in Cumberland were greatly improved. [[John Loudon McAdam|John McAdam]] supervised the construction of the roads from Keswick to [[Cockermouth]] in the west and [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] in the east.<ref>Bott, pp. 30<U+2013>31</ref> With the Lake District now accessible by coach the area attracted well-off visitors, particularly during [[List of conflicts in Europe#18th century|war in mainland Europe]] which made the aristocratic [[Grand Tour]] impossible there.<ref name=b43>Bott, p. 43</ref> Regular coach services were established in the 1760s, but they were expensive. The ten-hour journey from [[Whitehaven]] to Penrith via Keswick cost 12 shillings (60 pence in modern decimals), at a time when country labourers typically earned <U+00A3>24 a year or less, and the annual income of even the most prosperous tenant farmers was rarely more than <U+00A3>200.<ref>Bott, p. 91; and Olsen, p. 124</ref> Nonetheless, by the middle of the century the number of tourists visiting Keswick during each season was estimated at between 12,000 and 15,000.<ref>[http://www.johndobson.info/Tourists/NumberedPages/Page_28.php "The Growth of Keswick, with particular reference to its inns"], The Wordsworth Trust, retrieved 29 August 2014</ref> Some of the Keswick inns that catered for the prosperous visitors remain as hotels, including the Queen's, where Gray stayed.<ref name=b43/>

[[File:Pencil-making-Keswick-1850s.jpg|thumb|left|Pencil-making at Keswick, 1865]]
The construction of the railways in the mid-19th century made the Lake District in general and Keswick in particular more accessible to visitors of modest means. The original impetus for building the [[Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway]] (CKP) line came from heavy industry: the new [[Bessemer process]] of steelmaking brought a great demand for the rich iron ore from west Cumberland and the [[coke (fuel)|coking]] coal from [[County Durham|Durham]] on the east side of the country. The CKP was built to enable ore and coal to be brought together at steel foundries in both counties.<ref>Bott, p. 93</ref> The line opened for goods traffic in 1864, and the following year it began to carry passengers.<ref>Gradon, p. 23</ref> Fares varied, but holidaymakers could buy tickets at bargain prices, such as six shillings for the 170-mile return journey from [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] to Keswick.<ref>Bott, p. 96</ref>

In addition to its growing importance as a tourist centre, Keswick developed a reputation for its manufacture of pencils during the 19th century. It had begun on a modest scale in or about 1792, as a [[cottage industry]], using graphite mined locally. This developed on more industrial lines in factories purpose-built by several companies.<ref name=pencils>[http://www.pencils.co.uk/aboutus.aspx?mid=1254 "History"] Derwent Pencils, retrieved 30 June 2014; and Bott, pp. 23<U+2013>24</ref> Pencil making was the town's most important manufacturing industry by the mid-19th century, textiles and leather goods having declined.<ref name=pencils/>

The Moot Hall was rebuilt in 1813, the lower floor being used as a market house on Saturdays. Coal gas was supplied by a gas works from 1846; the Keswick library opened in 1849;<ref>Bott, p. 122</ref> a water works began operation in 1856; and the Keswick police station opened in 1857.<ref>Bott, pp. 88 and 122</ref> The local weekly newspaper, ''The Keswick Reminder'' was founded in 1896, and at 2014 continues to be published every Friday. In an article in ''The Observer'' in 1978, [[Christopher Brasher]] wrote that as long as the ''Reminder'' flourishes, "there will be one corner of these islands that is forever England."<ref>Brasher, Christopher. "Secrets of a success story", ''The Guardian'', 9 July 1978, p. 11</ref>

[[File:Canon-Rawnsley.jpg|thumb|[[Hardwicke Rawnsley|Canon Hardwick Rawnsley]], cleric and conservationist]]
In 1883 [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]] was appointed vicar of Crosthwaite. In a study of Lake District towns in 1974, H A L Rice commented that to write about Keswick without mentioning Rawnsley would be the equivalent of writing about [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] without mentioning Shakespeare, so great was Rawnsley's impact on the town. He and his wife set up classes to teach metalwork and wood carving; these grew into the School of Industrial Art, which trained local craftsmen and -women from 1894 until it closed in 1986.<ref name=w2>Winter, Chapter 2, unnumbered page</ref> He revived the ancient May Day festival in the town, and was a leading figure in the establishment of Keswick School, Blencathra Sanatorium and the County Farm School.<ref name=w2/> As co-founder of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], Rawnsley contributed to Keswick's continued growth as a tourist centre, with the acquisition by the Trust of many acres of popular scenic land around Derwentwater, beginning with Brandelhow Wood in 1902.<ref>[http://www.visitcumbria.com/national-trust-in-cumbria-history/ "The History of The National Trust in Cumbria"], Visit Cumbria, retrieved 27 August 2014</ref>

===20th century and beyond===
Keswick's history throughout the 20th century was one of increasing reliance on tourism, with the pencil industry as the second largest source of employment. The Cumberland Pencil Company, formed at the turn of the century, occupied a large factory near the [[River Greta, Cumbria|River Greta]] on the road leading out of Keswick towards Cockermouth.<ref>Bott, p. 24</ref> The conservation movement continued to develop; Rawnsley led successful campaigns to save the medieval Greta and [[Portinscale]] bridges from replacement with ferro-concrete structures;<ref>"The Care of Old Bridges", ''The Times'', 30 October 1911, p. 9; and "Portinscale Bridge", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 1 November 1911, p. 8</ref> and the National Trust continued to acquire land locally.<ref>"Friar's Crag for the Nation: Memorial to Canon Rawnsley", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 5 February 1921, p. 6</ref> In common with other towns throughout the country, Keswick lost many of its young men in the First World War: the town's war memorial near [[Fitz Park]] commemorates 117 names.<ref>[http://www.ww1-yorkshires.org.uk/html-files/keswick-cumbria.htm "War Memorials Elsewhere: Keswick, Cumbria"], The Yorkshire Regiment, retrieved 28 August 2014</ref>

By the 1930s Keswick was firmly established as the main centre of tourism in Cumberland and Westmorland. An article in ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' in 1934 called it "the capital of the Lake District", and continued:
{{quote|Keswick's chief industry is to promote the contentment and happiness of its visitors. Its pleasant position provides at the outset a tonic atmosphere <U+2026> it is set in the most delightful part of a delightful district, described by Wordsworth as "the loveliest spot that ever man has found." There are numerous places of interest and fine shops, and good accommodation is offered to visitors at reasonable prices. Keswick is the best centre from which to visit Lakeland.<ref>"Keswick and the Lake District", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 24 March 1934, p. 17</ref>|}}

During the Second World War students from [[Liverpool Hope University|St Katharine's College, Liverpool]] and [[Roedean School]], [[Sussex]] were evacuated to Keswick when their own buildings were requisitioned for use as a hospital and a navy base respectively.<ref>Wilkinson, pp. 139 and 170<U+2013>171; [http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1405046 "Former St Katharine's College"], English Heritage; and [http://www.roedean.co.uk/senior-school-history-of-roedean/ "History of Roedean"], Roedean, both retrieved 30 June 2014</ref> Students were also brought to the safety of Keswick from the [[Central Newcastle High School]],<ref>Wilkinson, pp. 74<U+2013>75</ref> Hunmanby Hall School, [[Yorkshire]],<ref>Wilkinson, p. 123</ref> and the Liverpool Orphanage.<ref>Wilkinson, pp. 136<U+2013>138</ref>

Any prospect of major expansion of the town was ruled out after the war by the creation of the [[Lake District National Park]] in 1951.<ref>Robinson, Jeremy Rownan.

==Ownership and governance==
[[File:James Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater - Project Gutenberg eText 20946.jpg|thumb|The ill-fated Lord Derwentwater]]
In medieval times the township was within the manor of Castlerigg and Derwentwater. The first known official record of the town is the charter of 1276 granted to the lord of the manor, Thomas de Derwentwater. The manor was granted by Alice de Romilly to Adam de Derwentwater before 1216, and subsequently passed to the Radclyffe family through marriage. The Derwentwater estate was forfeit to the Crown after the execution of [[James Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater|James Radclyffe]], third Earl of Derwentwater, in 1716 for his part in the [[Jacobite rising of 1715|Jacobite rebellion]] the previous year.<ref name=b61/> In 1735 the Crown granted the income from the estates to support the [[Greenwich Hospital, London]]. Land to the south and west were part of Greenwich Hospital's forestry and farming estates until the 19th century.<ref name=b61>Bott, p. 61</ref> In 1925 the National Trust acquired 90 acres of land in this estate, including the foreshore woodland, the gift of Sir John Randles.<ref>Sir John Randles's Gift", ''The Times'', 24 August 1925, p. 11</ref>

Keswick became a Local Government District in 1853 and an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] with three wards in 1894, reflecting its growth in the latter part of the 19th century. The new urban district's northern boundary was extended from the Greta to the railway, taking in Great Crosthwaite and part of Underskiddaw in 1899. In 1974 the urban district was abolished and since then the town has been administered by Keswick Town Council and [[Allerdale]] Borough Council.<ref>[http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C11292928 "Local Government Act 1972: borough status; Allerdale, Cumbria"], The National Archives, retrieved 29 August 2014</ref>

===Churches===
{{See also|Keswick Convention}}
[[File:The Parish Church of Keswick, St John - geograph.org.uk - 475546.jpg|thumb|St John's Church dating from 1838]]
Until 1838 Keswick had no church within the town boundaries and was part of the widespread parish of [[Crosthwaite Parish Church|Crosthwaite]]. The [[Quaker]]s had an early meeting house in the town, replaced in 1715 by one at Underskiddaw. Protestant dissenters met at a private house from 1705 or before, moving to the a chapel in Lake Road in the latter part of the 18th century.<ref name=b130>Bott, pp. 130<U+2013>133</ref>

Keswick's [[Anglican]] church, St John's, was designed by [[Anthony Salvin]] and consecrated in 1838. A [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]] chapel had already been opened nearby in 1814, and a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] chapel was built in 1858<U+2013>59.<ref name=b130/> St John's Church, geometrical in style, built with pink castle-head ashlar sandstone and a slate roof, was further extended in 1862, 1882 and 1889 by W. Marshall, and the chancel windows, designed by [[Henry Holiday]], also date to that year. It became a Grade II* listed building in 1951.<ref>[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-71800-church-of-st-john-keswick-cumbria Church of St John, Keswick], Britishlistedbuildings.co.uk, retrieved 31 August 2014</ref> Another parish church, the Church of St Kentigern on Church Lane, is also Grade II* listed. Dated to at least the 14th century, it is built mainly in the Tudor-Gothic style and was expanded in 1523 and later restored in 1844 by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]].<ref>[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-71770-church-of-st-kentigern-keswick-cumbria Church of St Kentigern, Keswick], Britishlistedbuildings.co.uk, retrieved 31 August 2014</ref>

In May each year, Keswick is host to three contrasting events. The Keswick Half Marathon, in the early part of the month takes participants around Derwentwater with an additional loop into [[Newlands Valley]].<ref name=what>[http://www.keswick.org/whats-on/whats-on-in-keswick/ "Month by Month guide to what's on"], Keswick <U+2013> The Lake District, retrieved 25 June 2014</ref> In the second week of May there is the four-day Keswick Jazz Festival, with more than 100 jazz events at a dozen local venues. Participants include British and international exponents of mainstream and traditional jazz.<ref name=what/> After the Jazz Festival is the four-day Keswick Mountain Festival in mid-May. In the words of the organisers, the festival "celebrates everything we all love about the outdoors".<ref name=what/> It includes [[Ravine|ghyll]] scrambling, mountain biking, guided walks, map reading, canoeing, climbing, a triathlon and other events.<ref name=what/>
 
The main event of the town's calendar in June is the Keswick Beer Festival, a two-day event that attracts more than 5,000 participants each year. More than 250 barrels of beer, lager and cider are on offer, accompanied by music from live bands.<ref name=what/> In July one of the town's best-known annual fixtures begins: the [[Keswick Convention]], an international gathering of [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Christians, described in 1925 as "the last stronghold of British Puritanism",<ref>"Keswick Convention Growing: Puritanism's 'Last Stronghold'", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 21 July 1925, p. 18</ref> promoting biblical teaching and pious lifestyles.<ref>[http://www.keswickministries.org/about-us/who-we-are "Who We Are"], Keswick Ministries, retrieved 27 August 2014</ref> Among those associated with the Convention have been [[Frank Buchman]] and [[Billy Graham]].<ref>Bott, p. 135</ref> The event has grown from a single week to three weeks, straddling the latter part of July and early August.<ref name=what/>

In August, Keswick features the Derwentwater Regatta. It was inaugurated by the eccentric local landowner Joseph Pocklington in 1792,<ref>Holroyd, James Edward. "Pocklington's Island", ''The Guardian'', 23 April 1962, p. 5</ref> and after a lapse of more than two centuries was revived in 2013.<ref>[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/borrowdale/things-to-see-and-do/article-1355789995156/ "King Pocky's Regatta revived on Derwent Water"], National Trust, retrieved 25 June 2014</ref> Its organisers describe it as "A weekend of mayhem and madness afloat, with the chance to climb aboard in a variety of races on Derwentwater".<ref name=what/> The Keswick Agricultural Show, founded in 1860, has traditionally been held on August Bank Holiday Monday at the western edge of the town on the Crossing Fields section of the open land known as the Howrahs.{{#tag:ref|The name dates back to the 18th century; the historian J W Kaye links it to the landowner, [[Edward Stephenson (colonial administrator)|Edward Stephenson]], who retired to his native Keswick having been an important figure in the [[East India Company]].

===Lake Poets and other Keswick notables===
[[File:Greta Hall.jpg|thumb|Greta Hall, behind Greta Bridge]]
Coleridge and [[William Wordsworth]] were close friends and collaborators; when Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy took up residence in the Lake District in late 1799 it was, in Bott's word, inevitable that Coleridge would follow suit. Six months after the Wordsworths moved into [[Dove Cottage]] at [[Grasmere]], Coleridge leased [[Greta Hall]] in Keswick, {{convert|12|mi|km}} away.<ref>Bott, p. 69</ref> In 1803 [[Robert Southey]], Coleridge's brother-in-law, agreed to share the house with Coleridge and his family. Southey remained at Greta Hall after Coleridge left in 1804, and it remained Southey's family home until his death in 1843.<ref>Bott, pp. 73 and 78</ref> Many famous literary figures stayed at Greta Hall in these years, including the Wordsworths, [[Charles Lamb|Charles and Mary Lamb]], [[Thomas de Quincey]], [[William Hazlitt]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and [[Sir Walter Scott]].<ref name=lp>Bott, pp. 73<U+2013>79</ref> Lamb, a Londoner devoted to his native city, remained doubtful of the attractions of the Lake District, but most of the visitors to Greta Hall wrote eloquently of the beauty of the scenery, and further enhanced the public regard for, and desire to visit, the area.<ref name=lp/> Southey was well regarded locally, but played little part in the life of the town.<ref name=lp/> He is buried in Crosthwaite churchyard and there is a memorial to him inside the church, with an inscription written by Wordsworth.<ref>Hyde and Pevsner, p. 315</ref>

Before the Lake Poets the best-known resident of Keswick was probably [[John Bankes|Sir John Bankes]], a leading Royalist during the [[English Civil War]]. He was [[Charles I of England|Charles I's]] Attorney General and Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. Bankes was born at Castlerigg near Keswick in 1589.<ref>Brooks, Christopher W, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1288 "Bankes, Sir John (1589<U+2013>1644)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, January 2008, retrieved 28 August 2014 {{ODNBsub}}</ref> A bust in his memory is in upper Fitz Park close to the museum.<ref>[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM553G_Sir_John_Bankes_Keswick_Cumbria_UK "Sir John Bankes - Keswick, Cumbria, UK"], Waymarking, retrieved 28 August 2014</ref>

Of literary figures after the Lake Poets among those most closely associated with Keswick was the novelist [[Hugh Walpole]]. In 1924 Walpole moved into Brackenburn, a house between Keswick and Grange at the opposite end of Derwentwater.<ref>Hart-Davis, p. 249</ref> Like the Lake Poets in the previous century, he wrote enthusiastically about the Lake District, and its scenery and atmosphere often found their way into his fiction. He wrote in 1939, "That I love Cumberland with all my heart and soul is another reason for my pleasure in writing these Herries books. That I wasn't born a Cumbrian isn't my fault: that Cumbrians, in spite of my 'foreignness', have been so kind to me, is my good fortune."<ref>Walpole, p. vii</ref>

==Education==
The Crosthwaite Free Grammar School was built in 1566 and had up to 200 pupils, of both sexes; the building adjoined the Crosthwaite churchyard.<ref>Winter, Ch 3, unnumbered page</ref> In 1819 the parish of Crosthwaite had five or six schools in the town and the outlying areas, with a total of 332 children. By 1833 Keswick had twelve daily schools, including a new [[National school (England and Wales)|National School]] at High Hill.<ref>Bott, p. 144</ref> The new parish church of Keswick, St John's, started educational work in 1840 with a Sunday school which also educated infant boys, and later girls, on weekdays. A full-time boys' school opened in 1853.<ref name=b145/> For older pupils, Keswick School, the free grammar school previously in [[Underskiddaw]], moved to a new site diagonally opposite Greta Bridge in 1898 as a co-educational school. In 1951 a new [[secondary modern]] school was built at Lairthwaithe in Underskiddaw.<ref name=b145>Bott, pp. 145<U+2013>146</ref>

Since 2005 junior education has been provided by St Herbert's School, one of the largest primary schools in Cumbria.<ref>[http://keswickstjohn.org.uk/st-herberts-school/ "St Herbert's School"], Keswick St John, retrieved 29 August 2014</ref> At senior level, Keswick and Lairthwaite schools merged in 1980 as a single comprehensive secondary school, with the name Keswick School.

Keswick is on the [[A66 road]] linking [[Workington]] and Penrith, as well as the [[A591 road|A591]], linking the town to [[Windermere (town)|Windermere]], [[Kendal]] and Carlisle (via the [[A595 road|A595]]).<ref>[http://england-map1.com/roadmap_of_Cumbria_county_506259.html "Map of Cumbria"], Autoatlas England, retrieved 28 August 2014</ref>

There are no rail links to Keswick; the line built in the 1860s for the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway closed in 1972.{{#tag:ref|From 1923 to 1948 the line was part of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]]; from 1948 until its closure it was part of [[British Railways]].<ref>Western, pp. 143, 157, and 187</ref>|group= n}} Since the 1990s a plan to rebuild it has been under discussion,<ref>Western, pp. 187<U+2013>190</ref> but as at 2014 the only public transport serving the towns and villages on the old railway route is a bus service operating at mostly hourly intervals. The bus journey from the main line station at Penrith to Keswick takes a scheduled 47 minutes.<ref>[http://www.stagecoachbus.com/PdfUploads/Timetable_51386_X4%20X5%20%28West%20Cumbria%29.pdf "Penrith, Keswick, Cockermouth, Workington"], Stagecoach, retrieved 28 August 2014</ref>

The town is served by a range of other bus routes providing direct connections with Carlisle, Cockermouth, Kendal, Lancaster, Penrith, Windermere, Workington and other towns and villages in the north west.<ref name=stagecoach>[http://www.stagecoachbus.com/uploads/lakedistrictnetworkmapsummera4jun14.pdf "Central Lakes"], Stagecoach, retrieved 28 August 2014</ref> The flow of traffic from Penrith to Cockermouth and beyond was eased after the A66 was diverted to a new bypass in 1974, a development that caused controversy because of a prominent new viaduct carrying the road across the Greta Gorge to the north of the town.<ref>"Lakes proposals 'roused very strong emotions'", ''The Times'', 18 March 1972, p. 3</ref>

The majority of visitors arrive by car and are catered for by three town centre car parks, another large one next to the Theatre by the Lake, and smaller ones elsewhere in the town.<ref>[http://www.allerdale.gov.uk/transport-and-streets/parking/off-street-car-parks/car-park-list.aspx "Car park list"], Allerdale Borough Council, retrieved 28 August 2014</ref>
