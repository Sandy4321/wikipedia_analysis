Swami Satyananda Saraswati was born 1923 at Almora (Uttaranchal) in the foothills of the Himalayas, into a family of farmers and [[zamindar]]s.<ref name="(Swami)Yoga1995">{{cite book

As a youth he was classically educated and studied Sanskrit, the Vedas and the Upanishads. Swami Satyananda began to have spiritual experiences at the age of six, when his awareness spontaneously left the body and he saw himself lying motionless on the floor. Many saints and [[sadhu]]s blessed him and reassured his parents that he had a very developed awareness. This experience of disembodied awareness continued, which led him to many saints of that time such as [[Anandamayi Ma]]. Swami Satyanada also met a [[Tantra|tantric]] [[bhairavi]], [[Sukhman Giri]], who gave him [[shaktipat]] and directed him to find a guru in order to stabilize his spiritual experiences.<ref name="Yoga and Kriya">Swami Satyananda Saraswati. "A Systematic Course in the Ancient Tantric Techniques of Yoga and Kriya", Yoga Publication Trust, 2004. ISBN 81-85787-08-5</ref>

At age eighteen, he left his home in order to seek a spiritual master. In 1943 at the age of nineteen, Swami Satyananda met his [[guru]] [[Swami Sivananda]] and came to live at [[Sivananda Ashram]] in [[Rishikesh]].  Swami Sivananda gave him the name Satyananda and initiated him as a [[Paramahamsa]] sannyasin of the Dashnama sannyasa order, on the banks of the river Ganges on September 12, 1947. Swami Sivananda described him as a <U+2018>versatile genius<U+2019> who <U+2018>did the work of four people<U+2019>. Swami Satyananda served in different departments at the ashram for over 12 years. He did physical labor, edited the ashram's Hindi journal, wrote various articles and composed poems in both [[Hindi]] and [[Sanskrit]]. He wrote a translation and commentary in the English language of the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] by Swami Sivananda. 

In 1956 after receiving the instruction from his Guru to spread yoga from door to door and shore to shore, Swami Satyananda  he wandered throughout India as a mendicant [[parivrajaka]] traveling through [[Afghanistan]], [[Nepal]], [[Burma]] and [[Ceylon]] for the next 7 years, extending his knowledge of spiritual practices. He eventually found his way to [[Munger]], in the province of [[Bihar]]. After establishing himself there, in 1963 he founded the [[International Yoga Fellowship]] and the [[Bihar School of Yoga]] a year later.<ref name="Alter2004">{{cite book

He lectured and taught globally for the next twenty years, including tours in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, North America, and Colombia and authored over thirty textbooks on yoga and spiritual life. By 1983 Bihar School of Yoga was well established and recognized throughout the world as a reputed and authentic center for learning yoga and the spiritual sciences.  At the peak of his accomplishment, Swami Satyananda renounced all that he created. He handed the active work of his ashram and organization to his spiritual successor [[Swami Niranjanananda]] and in 1988 departed from Munger, never to return again.<ref name="Mumford1995">{{cite book

==Teachings==
Swami Satyananda's teachings emphasize an "Integral Yoga" with a strong emphasis on [[Tantra]],<ref name="Melton2003">{{cite book

This system addresses the qualities of head, heart and hands <U+2013> intellect, emotion and action and attempts to integrate the physical, psychological and spiritual dimensions of yoga into each practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yogamag.net/archives/2000/ajan00/growth.shtml|title=The Growth of Satyananda Yoga or Bihar Yoga|accessdate=2009-12-09}}</ref> 
Swami Satyananda brought the yogic side of tantra to the forefront. In 1971 Tantra Yoga Panorama was published in which the concepts of tantra were outlined as applicable to the needs of today's society.<ref name="ReferenceA">Tantra-yoga panorama, Swami Satyananda Saraswati,International Yoga Fellowship Movement</ref> Swami Satyananda codified the wisdom of yoga in ancient tantric scriptures and made it accessible to the modern aspirant. He defined the pawanmuktasana series, the shakti bandhas and the grouping of the various asanas according to position.  Pranayama, prana vidya and the role of mudras and bandhas were scientifically explained by him and made generally available for the first time.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
Swami Satyananda classified and expounded the techniques given in the tantras as a series of different stages and levels of pratyahara such as antar mouna, and different stages of meditation.<ref>Meditations From the Tantras, Swami Satyananda Saraswati,Yoga Publications Trust</ref> He invented the technique of yoga nidra, now known worldwide as Satyananda Yoga Nidra, according to the tantric system of nyasa and defined and codified the different stages of the technique.<ref>Yoga Nidra, Swami Satyananda Saraswati,Yoga Publications Trust</ref>

His system of tantric yoga involves the practice of:

* '''[[Kundalini Yoga]]''', in the tradition following Swami Sivananda's explanation. Kundalini Yoga is the yoga of the evolutionary energy of the universe.
* '''[[Kriya Yoga]]''', in the form of Tapas, Svadhyaya and Ishvarapranidhana.  Tapas is the practice of austerities.  Svadhyaya is study of spiritual literature and also repetition of a personal mantra.  Ishvarapranidhana is self-surrender to the Lord and doing all actions as an offering unto the Lord.
* '''[[mantra|Mantra Yoga]]''', the repetition of sacred sounds.
* '''[[Laya yoga|Laya Yoga]]''', the practice of a state of absorption on an object of meditation.
* The four advanced stages of the '''Eight Limbs of Yoga''' as codified by [[Patanjali]]: [[Pratyahara]], [[Dharana]], [[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]] and [[Sam<U+0101>dhi|Samadhi]].
