|quote=Square Soft's final title for Super NES was ''Super Mario RPG'', a game that took Square Soft's signature in<U+2013>depth stories and turn<U+2013>based combat and applied them to the Mario universe. With the game's great graphics and a slowly growing base of RPG players, ''Super Mario RPG'' sales exceeded Nintendo's rather conservative expectations. Then, as Nintendo prepared to unveil Nintendo 64, Square Soft announced that it was switching allegiances. Like [[Namco]] before it, Square Soft was going to make console games exclusively for [[PlayStation]]. The split was bitter. So bitter, in fact, that even after Nintendo reestablished relations with Namco in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]], [[Hiroshi Yamauchi|Yamauchi]] still refused to work with Square Soft. When asked if Nintendo would allow Square Soft to publish games for a new console called <U+201C>[[Nintendo GameCube#Hardware specifications|Dolphin]]<U+201D> that would not be released until the year 2001, [[Minoru Arakawa]] quietly replied, <U+201C>I do not think it is yet time for Square Soft.<U+201D>

==Gameplay==
In ''Super Mario RPG'', [[Mario]], [[Bowser (Nintendo)|Bowser]], Princess Toadstool, Mallow and Geno fight as allies in the first [[console role-playing game]] (RPG) in the [[List of Mario games by year|''Mario'' series]]. It contains token similarities to many other Square role-playing games such as ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' and the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series with a story and action-based gameplay based on the ''Super Mario Bros.'' series.<ref name="Fans">{{Cite news|author=Scott Pelland|coauthors=Kent Miller, Terry Munson, Paul Shinoda|date=1996-10|title=Epic Center|work=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=[[Minoru Arakawa|M.

[[Image:Super Mario RPG Battle Screenshot.png|thumb|left|Mario and [[Mallow (Super Mario RPG)|Mallow]] battle the [[Boss (video games)|boss]] Belome in a battle screen.]] Mario's enemies are visible in the field; a battle ensues only if he comes in contact with one. This allows the player to evade unnecessary battles, though some fights are necessary to advance the plot. Avoiding battles also means acquiring fewer experience points, causing characters to take greater, and inflict less, damage from attacks, making battles more difficult.

===Battle system===
The battles themselves are a blend of platforming elements and traditional role-playing game battles. As well as selecting attacks, the player is usually required to perform action commands to increase the damage done. These consist of timed button presses and other movements (such as pressing {{Keypress|A}} at the right moment, rotating the control pad or pressing {{Keypress|Y}} repeatedly) to determine the power of the character's attack, a concept that was carried over to some later role-playing games such as ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]''. As with many other role-playing games, items are an important tool in battles. The need to perform action commands in between navigating menus requires the player to be engaged in the battle the whole time. However, much of ''Super Mario RPG''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s gameplay is outside of monster battles. In the field, the game plays much like an isometric platformer, in which traditional Mario features and new ones (such as magic spells) play a key role. There are five characters the player can control: Mario, Mallow, Geno, Bowser, and Princess Toadstool. Each character has a unique set of attacks and techniques.

==Plot==
===Setting===
{{main|World of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars}}

===Characters===
{{Main|List of characters in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars}}
The game's main characters include three of the main individuals of the franchise as well as two original characters. [[List of characters in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars#Mario|Mario]] is the main character, and the hero who often saves the world. He never speaks. On his way to find and rescue [[List of characters in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars#Princess Toadstool|Princess Toadstool]] <U+2014> a common objective from previous Mario games <U+2014> he meets up with the cloud-like being [[List of characters in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars#Mallow|Mallow]], who believes he is a tadpole. As he returns to his home with Mario, he learns the truth, that he is not a tadpole, and he was found floating in a river by his adoptive grandfather, [[List of characters in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars#Frogfucius|Frogfucius]], and sets off with Mario in the hope of finding his true parents. On their search, they meet a being from Star Road, who possesses a young boy's doll, [[List of characters in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars#Geno|Geno]], taking on the doll's name and persona. He explains that he is an otherworldly traveler sent by a higher authority to recover the seven Star Pieces that must be found in order to stop [[List of characters in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars#Smithy Gang|Smithy]], the main villain of the game. They eventually run into [[List of characters in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars#Bowser|Bowser]], and save Princess Toadstool. Bowser decides to help Mario, so he can reclaim his castle from the Smithy Gang; and the Princess, desperate to help, sneaks out of the Mushroom Kingdom to help on their travels.

===Story===
[[Image:Croco.gif|thumb|left|Croco attempts to escape from Mario and Mallow.]]

The game begins with [[Mario]] entering [[Bowser's Castle]] to rescue [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]]. During the battle, a [[List of characters in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars#Exor|giant sword]] crashes into Bowser<U+2019>s castle and sends Mario, Peach, and Bowser flying in different directions. Mario finds his way back to the [[Mushroom Kingdom]], where the chancelor insists that Mario recover the princess, then discover the purpose of the giant sword. 

Mario leaves the Mushroom Kingdom to aid a new friend of his named [[Mallow (Super Mario RPG)|Mallow]], and when he returns, he finds that the kingdom is overrun by creatures claiming to be part of the [[Smithy (Mario)|Smithy]] gang. When he defeats them, he finds a mysterious Star Piece. He takes, it, hoping to find out more about it later.

During Mario<U+2019>s search for the princess, he meets a [[doll]] named Geno who is possessed by a star spirit. He tells Mario that the Star Piece is part of the [[Star Road]], where Geno lives. He must find all of the shattered pieces of Star Road in order to repair it, which are held by members of the Smithy gang. Mario agrees to help Geno in his search.

Mario eventually finds Bowser, trying to reassemble his forces; and the princess, as she is about to be forcibly married to a character named Booster. They both join Mario<U+2019>s party and help look for Star Pieces. 

[[Image:Cloudssmrpg.gif|thumb|right|Valentina (top right), with Nimbus Land citizens.]]

When they have most of the Star Pieces, they learn that the last one is held in Bowser<U+2019>s Castle. They return to Bowser<U+2019>s Castle, and discover that the giant sword is a gateway to Smithy<U+2019>s [[factory]]. They confront Smithy in his factory, and defeat him. They then use the Star Pieces to repair Star Road.

==Development==
The game was officially unveiled by both [[Mario]] creator and producer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and co-director [[Chihiro Fujioka]] at the 1995 V-Jump Festival event in Japan<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YObbL5LwCJs. The unveiling of Super Mario RPG from the V-Jump Festival in 1995.</ref>. Miyamoto led talented teams at Nintendo and Square who spent more than a year developing, as ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' wrote, <U+201C>the most stunning graphics of any RPG at the time.<U+201D><ref name="Developer"/> The story takes place in a newly rendered [[Mushroom Kingdom]] based on the [[Super Mario Bros. (game series)|''Super Mario Bros.'' series]]. A town of mining moles (Moleville), tropical forest (Forest Maze), mushroom castle (Mushroom Kingdom), thundering waterfall (Midas River), giant bean stalk (Land's End), and villages crowded with [[Toad (Nintendo)|mushroom people]] were a few of the exterior locations at the time Square reported the game was about 70% complete in October [[1995 in video gaming|1995]], when ''Nintendo Power'' announced Mario finds himself riding [[Mode 7]] rail cars, which exist in the Moleville mines. Square created all the interior elements such as columns and stairways and exterior elements using Advanced Computer Modeling (ACM) techniques. Special lighting effects create the shadows and reflections that give the 3D elements such a full, realistic appearance.<ref name="Publisher"/><ref name="New Ground"/>

With guidance from Miyamoto, Square developed the game in [[Japan]] combining parts of its traditional RPGs, ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' and ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'', with Nintendo's platform games. Square's [[Final Fantasy (series)|''Final Fantasy'' series]] was the model for the battle sequences while the tradition of ''Super Mario Bros.'' games demanded a lot of action. During visits to town, Mario talks to people, buys items, and learns secrets just as in a standard RPG, but the 3D graphics show Mario does more than previous RPG characters, even highly animated heroes such as [[Characters of Chrono Trigger#Crono|Crono]].<ref name="Chrono">{{cite news|author=Scott Pelland|year=1995-11|title=Epic News|pages=51|quote=A sixty percent completed version of Super Mario RPG magically appeared at the Epic Center desk and proceeded to stun everyone who saw it. The biggest surprise was that there was an actual RPG battle system, contrary to what we had heard earlier. Mario does stomp on enemies, but that only launches the battle screen sequence, which turns out to be menu based.<U+2026> During visits to town, Mario talks to people, buys items and learns secrets just as in a standard RPG, but the 3<U+2013>D graphics shine and Mario does more than previous RPG characters, even highly animated heroes such as Chrono.}}</ref> Mario must dodge a salvo of [[List of Mario series enemies#Bullet Bill|Bullet Bill]]s in the [[#Sunken Ship|Sunken Ship]], recreate a tune by hopping across musical tadpoles in [[#Tadpole Pond|Tadpole Pond]], and hop to turn a huge nut so that it travels along the thread of a bridge made from a giant bolt in the [[#Factory|Factory]]. Mario's ability to jog in eight directions and jump up or down in three<U+2013>quarter perspective gives him complete 3D motion. Mario's radically new screen perspective is reminiscent of action games such as ''[[Equinox (video game)|Equinox]]'', but at the current stage of completion, the mix of adventure and action game play elements placed it in a category closer to ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]''.<ref name="Publisher"/><ref name="New Ground"/>

When Nintendo of America (NOA) received a 60% complete version in November, the biggest surprise was that there was an actual RPG battle system, contrary to what NOA heard earlier. Mario stomping on enemies launches the battle screen sequence. The battle screens, rendered just like the rest of the game, include attack animations of equipped weapons.<ref name="Chrono"/>

Compared to previous Mario games, where characters only moved left, right, up or down, there are four times as many ways to go, the most dramatic change in the character's 15<U+2013>year history up until that point. Created by [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] workstations, the game's graphics could only compare to [[Rare (company)|Rare]]'s ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]]'', [[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble]], and ''[[Killer Instinct]]''.<ref name="Publisher"/><ref name="New Ground"/>

''Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars'' is one of only three games outside Japan for the SNES to utilize the [[Nintendo SA-1]]. (The other two are ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' and ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]''.) Compared with standard SNES games, this additional [[microprocessor]] allows higher clock speed, faster [[random access memory|RAM]], greater memory mapping capabilities, data storage and compression, new [[direct memory access|DMA]] modes (such as [[raster graphics|bitmap]] to [[bit-plane|bitplane]] transfer), and built-in CIC lockout (for piracy protection and regional marketing control).<ref name="SA-1">{{cite web|url=http://www.myroms.com/super_nintendo/super_nintendo_roms.htm|title=MY ROMs.com : Super Nintendo Roms|accessdate=2007-05-06|author=My Roms.com|date=2007-03-20|work=MY ROMs.com : GBA Roms NDS|publisher=My Roms.com|pages=1|quote=SA-1 65c816 8/16-bit processor, clocked at 10 MHz.

Though various aspects of ''Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars'' have received somewhat mixed opinions, the setting of the game have been well received overall and have garnered praise for the quality of the graphics and visual style in particular. ''Nintendo Power''<U+2019>s review claimed the excellent 3D graphics helped the game appeal to a much wider audience than most traditional RPGs. In March [[1997 in video gaming|1997]], ''Nintendo Power'' nominated the game for several awards, including "Best Graphics", in a player's choice contest,<ref>{{cite news|author=Dan Owsen & Scott Pelland|date=1997-03|title=1996 Nintendo Power Award Nominations|pages=76, 77, 79-82|quote=Best Graphics <U+2026> 5.

Officially, ''Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars'' does not have a direct sequel, especially in terms of a sequel based on the original game's [[Plot (narrative)|plot]].

Some of the game's team members, including some from Square, went on to work on the ''[[List of Mario games by genre#Mario & Luigi|Mario & Luigi]]'' series. These developers include the two directors Yoshihiko Maekawa and Chihiro Fujioka, as well as music composer [[Yoko Shimomura]]. However, they provided different styles and mechanics than those of ''Super Mario RPG''.

Various locations and characters from the game appear in the children's book ''Mario and the Incredible Rescue'' released by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] in 2006. <ref> {{cite book|last = West|first = Tracey|url = http://www.amazon.com/Mario-Incredible-Rescue-Nintendo-Heroes/dp/0439843669/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204681978&sr=8-1|title = Mario and the Incredible Rescue|publisher = Scholastic Corporation|date = [[2006]]|isbn = 0439843669}} </ref>

The company has its priorities during this holiday season, and for that reason fans have been looking elsewhere for details in regard to what the Wii's unique retro catalog will offer. The [[Entertainment Software Ratings Board|ESRB]] (Entertainment Software Ratings Board) has already helped us confirm multiple titles expected to hit Wii early next year, and we've received an updated list just this morning.<U+201D><ref name="ESRB"/>

In the fall of [[2007]], [http://www.vc-reviews.com/ The Virtual Console Archive] changed the release information from <U+201C>ESRB rated<U+201D> to <U+201C>(No longer) ESRB rated<U+201D>, meaning the ESRB rated the game, but since removed it. However, The Virtual Console Archive does list the price at 800 [[Wii Points]].<ref>
