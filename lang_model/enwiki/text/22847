The '''1925 Florida hurricane''' was the fourth and final storm of the [[1925 Atlantic hurricane season]] and the latest [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfalling]] hurricane in the [[United States]].<ref name="hurdat"/> Forming out of a tropical depression on November&nbsp;27 near the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]], the system initially tracked southeastward before turning north as it gradually intensified. After skirting western [[Cuba]] on November&nbsp;30, the storm further strengthened into a hurricane before striking central [[Florida]] on December&nbsp;1. Within hours, the system transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] and emerged into the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The system moved onshore once more on December&nbsp;2 in [[North Carolina]] before turning east, away from the United States. On December&nbsp;5, the system is presumed to have dissipated offshore.

Throughout the system's existence, it was responsible for 73 fatalities, most of which resulted from offshore incidents. The worst loss of life took place off East Coast, where the 30 crewmen of the ''American SS Catopazi'' drowned. Property damage amounted to $3&nbsp;million (1925&nbsp;USD; ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|3000000|1925}}}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}&nbsp;USD), $1&nbsp;million (1925&nbsp;USD; ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|1000000|1925}}}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}&nbsp;USD) of which was in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]].

The 1925 Florida hurricane was first identified on November&nbsp;27, 1925 as a tropical depression situated to the southeast of the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]], nearly a month after the official end of the hurricane season.<ref name="hurdat">{{cite web|title=Atlantic Best Tracks, 1851 to 2007 Reanalyzed|year=2009|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=March 20, 2009|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/tra51to07-2125rean.txt}}</ref><ref name="FAQG1">{{cite web|author=Neal Dorst|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=January 21, 2010|accessdate=March 11, 2011|title=When is hurricane season ?|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G1.html}}</ref> Situated over {{convert|80|F|C|abbr=on}} waters,<ref name="Hur4">{{cite web|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|year=2009|accessdate=March 21, 2009|title=Raw Observations for Hurricane Four 1925|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/excelfiles_centerfix/192504.xls|format=[[Microsoft Excel|XLS]]}}</ref> the system slowly intensified, attaining tropical storm status roughly 12&nbsp;hours after forming, as it drifted towards the southeast before abruptly turning north-northwestward. Throughout November&nbsp;30, the storm quickly strengthened as it brushed the western tip of [[Cuba]] with winds of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h). Once in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the storm turned northeastward and intensified into the equivalent of a modern day [[SSHS#Category 1|Category&nbsp;1 hurricane]] on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]].<ref name="hurdat"/> The lowest known [[barometric pressure]] attained by the storm was 995&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] ([[Pascal (unit)|hPa]]; 29.38&nbsp;[[Inches of Mercury|inHg]]) as it moved inland.<ref name="Meta"/> Within hours of reaching this strength, the hurricane made [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] just south of [[Tampa, Florida]] as it began to transition into an [[extratropical cyclone]].<ref name="Meta"/><ref name="MWR">{{cite web|author=W.

Off the coast of [[The Carolinas]], the former hurricane became a large and powerful extratropical cyclone, attaining peak winds of 90&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h) along with a pressure of 979&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 28.91&nbsp;inHg), measured by the ''USS Patoka''.<ref name="hurdat"/><ref name="MWR"/> Gale force winds extended to at least [[New Jersey]], where winds of 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h) were recorded.<ref name="Meta"/> Throughout December&nbsp;2, the storm gradually slowed as it tracked roughly parallel to the [[United States East Coast|East Coast]].

==Impact==
From November&nbsp;28 to November&nbsp;30, the storm brought light rains to most of eastern Cuba.<ref name="Hur4"/> Although the cyclone had tropical storm-force winds at the time, the highest recorded wind in Cuba was 12&nbsp;mph (18&nbsp;km/h) in [[Havana]] and only 0.22&nbsp;[[Inch|in]] (5.58&nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]]) of rain fell in the city. The [[Swan Islands, Honduras|Swan Islands]], off the northern coast of [[Honduras]], recorded 2.36&nbsp;in (59.94&nbsp;mm) of precipitation during a three day span.<ref name="Hur4"/>

===United States===
During its passage through Florida, the hurricane produced torrential rain over coastal cities, peaking in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] at {{convert|14.08|in|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Meta"/> The storm caused significant property and crop damage along the Gulf Coast of Florida.
