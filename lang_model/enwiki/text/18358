{{Esperanto}}

[[Esperanto]] is written in a [[Latin alphabet]] of twenty-eight letters, upper and lower case. This is supplemented by [[punctuation]] marks and by various [[logograms]], such as the [[numeral]]s 0-9, currency signs such as $, and [[mathematical symbol]]s.

Twenty-two of the letters are identical in form to letters of the [[English language|English]] alphabet (q, w, x, and y being omitted). The remaining six have [[diacritic]] marks, ''[[C-circumflex|<U+0109>]]'', ''[[G-circumflex|<U+011D>]]'', ''[[H-circumflex|<U+0125>]]'', ''[[J-circumflex|<U+0135>]]'', ''[[S-circumflex|<U+015D>]]'', and ''[[U-breve|<U+016D>]]'' (that is, ''c'', ''g'', ''h'', ''j'', and ''s [[circumflex]]'', and ''u [[breve]]''). The full alphabet is:

{| align=center
|A||B||C||<U+0108>||D||E||F||G||<U+011C>||H||<U+0124>||I||J||<U+0134>||K||L||M||N||O||P||R||S||<U+015C>||T||U||<U+016C>||V||Z
|-
|a||b||c||<U+0109>||d||e||f||g||<U+011D>||h||<U+0125>||i||j||<U+0135>||k||l||m||n||o||p||r||s||<U+015D>||t||u||<U+016D>||v||z
|}

With the exception of ''c'' (= [ts]) and the diacritic letters, the letters have approximately the sound values of the [[help:IPA|IPA]]. (See [[Esperanto pronunciation]].) There is a nearly one-to-one correspondence of letter to sound; the only significant exceptions being the sequence ''kz'', as in ''ekzemple'', which is frequently pronounced [gz]; and borrowed words such as ''<U+016D>ato'' that use ''<U+016D>'' for initial [w], which is normally an allophone of ''v''. (See [[Esperanto phonology]].)

In handwritten Esperanto, the diacritics pose no problem. However, since they don't appear on standard [[alphanumeric keyboard]]s, various alternate methods have been devised for representing them in printed and typed text. The original method was a set of [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] now known as the "h-system", but with the rise of computer word processing a so-called "x-system" has become equally popular. These systems are described below. However, with the advent of [[Unicode]], the need for such work-arounds has lessened.

[[Image:SpesmiloItalic.png|left|thumbnail|50px|'''''Sm''''']]
Unique to the Esperanto script is the ''[[spesmilo]]'' (1000 [[currency|specie]]) sign, an '''''Sm''''' [[monogram]] for a now-obsolete international unit of auxiliary Esperanto currency used by a few [[Great Britain|British]] and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] banks before [[World War I]]. It has no Unicode value, and in ordinary fonts is transcribed as ''Sm'', usually italic.

== Origin ==
The script is modeled after Western Slavic scripts such as the [[Czech alphabet|Czech]] or [[Sorbian alphabet|Sorbian]] alphabet. However, the use of [[circumflex]]es instead of [[caron]]s for the letters ''<U+0109>, <U+011D>, <U+0125>, <U+0135>, <U+015D>'' avoids the appearance of any national version of the [[Latin alphabet]], and the non-Slavic bases ''g, j'' of the letters ''<U+011D>'' and ''<U+0135>,'' rather than Slavic ''d<U+017E>, <U+017E>,'' help preserve the printed appearance of Latinate and Germanic vocabulary such as ''<U+011D>enerala'' "general" and ''<U+0135>urnalo'' "journal". The letter ''v'' stands for either ''v'' or ''w'' of other languages. The letter ''<U+016D>'' of the diphthongs ''a<U+016D>, e<U+016D>'' appears to be from the [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] [[<U+0141>acinka alphabet]], historically associated with the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. (Today <U+0141>acinka is strikingly similar to the Esperanto alphabet, but in [[L. L. Zamenhof|Zamenhof]]'s day it was closer to Polish; the convergence came with orthographic reforms two decades after Zamenhof went public with Esperanto.)

Due to these Slavic origins, the spelling of geographic names is sometimes divergent from English. This is especially remarked upon when English has the letters ''x, w, qu,'' or ''gu'', as in ''Va<U+015D>intono'' "[[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]", ''Meksiko'' "[[Mexico City|Mexico]]", or ''Gvatemalo'' "[[Guatemala]]". However, such spellings are normal to several languages of Central, Northern, and Eastern Europe. Compare the Esperanto forms with Croatian ''Va<U+0161>ington, Meksiko,'' and ''Gvatemala.'' Likewise, ''cunamo,'' from Japanese ''[[tsunami]],'' is similar to Czech and Latvian ''cunami.''

== Non-printed variants ==
[[Image:Signuno abc.gif|thumbnail|250px|''Signuno alphabet & numerals'']]
Esperanto versions of [[Morse code|international Morse code]] and [[Braille]] include the six diacritic letters. In Braille, the circumflex is indicated by adding a point at position 6 (lower right), and the ''u-breve'' is the mirror image of ''u''. An Esperanto Braille magazine, ''A<U+016D>roro'', has been published since [[1920]]. 

There is a proposed [[manual alphabet]] as part of the ''[[Signuno]]'' project. Signuno itself, as signed Esperanto rather than a language in its own right, is a manual [[logogram|logographic]] Esperanto orthography. The Signuno alphabet deviates from international norms (that is, [[American Sign Language|ASL]] with an [[Irish Sign Language|Irish]] T) in that all letters are upright, with a straight wrist: the G is simply turned upright, while the H, P, Q are taken from Irish, the J from [[Russian Sign Language|Russian]], and the Z appears to be unique to Signuno. (It's shaped like an ASL 3, and appears to be derived from alphabetically adjacent V the way <U+016C> was derived from adjacent U.) The diacritic letters <U+015C>, <U+0124>, <U+011C>, <U+016C> are derived from their base letters S, H, G, U; while <U+0108> and <U+0134>, like J, are Russian. Numerals 1-5 include the thumb, 6-9 do not, and 10, 100, 1000 are the [[Roman numeral]]s X, C, M.

== The names of the letters of the alphabet ==
[[L. L. Zamenhof|Zamenhof]] simply tacked an ''-o'' onto each consonant to create the name of the letter, with the vowels representing themselves: ''a, bo, co, <U+0109>o, do, e, fo,'' etc. The diacritics are frequently mentioned overtly. For instance, ''<U+0109>'' may be called ''<U+0109>o <U+0109>apela'' or ''co <U+0109>apela'', from ''<U+0109>apelo'' (a hat), and ''<U+016D>'' may be called ''<U+016D>o luneta'' or ''u luneta'', from ''luno'' (a moon) plus the diminutive ''-et-''.

This is fine for [[initialism]]s such as ''ktp'' [kotopo] for ''etc.'', but can be problematic when spelling out names. This is especially true because several consonantal distinctions are difficult for some nationalities, who normally rely on the fact that Esperanto seldom uses these sounds to distinguish words. (That is, they don't form many [[minimal pair]]s.) Thus the pairs of letter names ''<U+0135>o <U+011D>o, <U+0125>o ho'' (or ''<U+0125>o ko''), ''co <U+0109>o'' (or ''co so'', or ''co to''), and ''<U+016D>o vo'' are problematic. In addition, over a noisy telephone connection it quickly becomes apparent that [[phonation|voicing]] distinctions can be difficult to make out: noise confounds the pairs ''po bo, to do, <U+0109>o <U+011D>o, ko go, fo vo, so zo, <U+015D>o <U+0135>o'', as well as the nasals ''mo no''. In addition, ''lo ro'' is a difficult distinction for many Asians, Africans, and Pacific Islanders; whereas speakers of languages with no {{IPA|/b/-/v/}} contrast, like Spanish or Japanese, have trouble with ''bo vo''. 

There have been several proposals to resolve this problem. The one closest to international norms (and thus the easiest to remember) that also clarifies all the above distinctions is a modification of a proposal by [[K<U+00E1>lm<U+00E1>n Kalocsay]]. It uses the vowel ''e'' after a consonant by default, but places the ''e'' before [[sonorant]]s and [[voiceless]] [[fricative]]s; uses ''a'' as the vowel for <h> and the voiceless [[plosives]], after the international names ''ha'' and ''ka'' for <h> and <k>; and uses the French name ''<U+0135>i'' for <<U+0135>>, the Greek ''<U+0125>i'' (chi) for <<U+0125>>, and the English ''ar'' for <r>. <V> has the vowel of ''<U+0135>i'' (but the other voiced fricative, <z>, does not, to avoid the problem of it palatalizing.) The diphthong offglide <<U+016D>> is named ''e<U+016D>'', the only real possibility given Esperanto [[phonotactics]] besides ''a<U+016D>'', which as the word for "or" would be inappropriate. <M> is called ''om'', as this alliterates well in the sequence ''l, m, n, o, p''. There are other patterns of vowels: the lines start with ''a i a i'' and finish with ''a a e e''. In the full ABC rhyme, the diacritic letters are placed at the end, where ''w, x, y'' are found in English, so as not to disrupt the pattern of letters many of us learned as children. All this makes the system more easily memorized than competing proposals. The modified Kalocsay abecedary is: 

:::::''a, be, ce, de, e, ef, ge, ha,<br />
:::::''i, je, ka, el, om, en, o, pa,<br />
:::::''ar, es, ta, u, vi, <U+0109>a, <U+011D>e,<br />
:::::''<U+0125>i kaj <U+0135>i, e<U+015D>, e<U+016D> kaj ze,<br />
:::::''plus ku, ikso, ipsilono,<br />
:::::''jen la abece-kolono.''<br/>

(''kaj'' means "and". The last two lines are:
:::::''plus cue, ex, wye,''
:::::''voil<U+00E0> the ABC column'')

Where letters are still confused, such as ''es'' vs ''e<U+015D>'', or ''a'' vs ''ha'', mention can be made of the diacritic (''e<U+015D> <U+0109>apela''), or to the manner of articulation of the sound (''ha brueta'' breathy aitch). Quite commonly, however, people will use the ''<U+2019>aitch as in <U+2019>ouse'' strategy used in English.

== Punctuation ==
As with most languages, punctuation is not completely standardized, but in Esperanto there is the additional complication of multiple competing national traditions. 

[[Comma (punctuation)|Comma]]s are required to introduce subordinate clauses (that is, before ''ke'' "that" or the ''ki-'' correlatives),
:''Mi ne scias, kiel fari tion.'' (I don't know how to do that.)
The comma is also used for the [[decimal point]], while thousands are separated by periods or non-breaking spaces: ''12.345.678,9'' or ''12&nbsp;345&nbsp;678,9''. 

[[Question mark]]s (?) and [[exclamation mark]]s (!) are used at the end of a clause, and may be internal to a sentence. Question words generally come at the beginning of a question, obviating the need for [[Inverted question mark and exclamation point in Spanish|Spanish-style inverted question marks]]. 

[[full stop|Period]]s may be used to indicate [[initialism]]s: ''k.t.p.'' or ''ktp'' for ''kaj tiel plu'' (et cetera), but not  abbreviations that retain the grammatical suffixes. Instead, a hyphen optionally replaces the missing letters: ''D-ro'' or ''Dro'' for ''Doktoro'' (Dr). With ordinal numerals, the adjectival ''a'' and accusative ''n'' may be superscripted: ''13a'' or ''13<U+00AA>'' (13<sup>th</sup>). The abbreviation ''k'' is used without a period for ''kaj'' (and); the [[ampersand]] (&) is not found. [[Roman numeral]]s are also  avoided. 

The [[hyphen]] is also occasionally used to clarify compounds, and to join grammatical suffixes to proper names that haven't been Esperantized or don't have a nominal ''-o'' suffix, such as the accusative on ''Kalocsay-n'' or ''K<U+00E1>lm<U+00E1>n-on''. Zamenhof used a hyphen to attach particles to correlatives, such as ''tiu-<U+0109>i'' (this one here), but this has fallen out of use. 

[[Quotation mark]]s show the greatest variety of any punctuation. Before computerized word processing, they reflected what the printer had available, which was often the national standard of the country where the printer was located.  &mdash;&nbsp;Dashes, <U+00AB>&nbsp;[[guillemets]]&nbsp;<U+00BB> (often <U+00BB>reversed<U+00AB>), <U+201C>double apostrophes<U+201D> (also often <U+201E>reversed<U+201C>), and more are all found. (However, the <U+300C>East Asian<U+300D>  quotes are not used, as they were designed to fit Chinese characters.) Very occasionally characters in a novel will be distinguished by individualizing the quotation marks used for them. Quotations are introduced with a comma or [[colon (punctuation)|colon]].

===Capitalization===
[[Capitalization]] is used for the first word of a sentence and for proper names ''used as nouns''. Names of months, days of the week, ethnicities, languages, and the adjectival forms of proper names, ''etc.'', are not typically capitalized [''anglo'' (an Englishperson), ''zamenhofa'' (Zamenhofian)], although national norms may override such generalizations. Titles are more variable: both the Romance style of capitalizing only the first word of the title and the English style of capitalizing all lexical words are found. 

All capitals or small capitals are used for [[acronym]]s and [[initialism]]s of proper names, like ''[[TEJO]]'', but not common expressions like ''ktp'' (etc.). Small capitals are also a common convention for [[family name]]s, to avoid the confusion of varying national naming conventions: ''[[K<U+00E1>lm<U+00E1>n Kalocsay|KALOCSAY K<U+00E1>lm<U+00E1>n]]'', ''Leslie CHEUNG Kwok Wing''. 

[[Camel case]], with or without a hyphen, may occur when a prefix is added to a proper noun: ''la geZamenhofoj'' (the Zamenhofs), ''pra-Esperanto'' ([[Proto-Esperanto]]). It is also used for [[Russian language|Russian]]-style syllabic acronyms, such as the name ''ReVo'' for ''Reta Vortaro'' ("Internet Dictionary"), which is homonymous with ''revo'' (dream). Occasionally mixed capitalization will be used for orthographic puns, such as ''espERAnto'', which stands for the ''Esperanto radikala asocio'' (Radical Esperanto Association). 

Zamenhof contrasted informal ''ci'' with formal, and capitalized, ''Vi'' as the second-person singular pronouns. However, lower-case ''vi'' is now used as the second-person pronoun regardless of number.

== ASCII transliteration systems ==
=== The h-system ===
The original method of working around the [[diacritic]]s was developed by the creator of Esperanto himself, [[L. L. Zamenhof]]. He recommended using ''u'' in place of ''<U+016D>'', and using [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] with ''h'' for the circumflex letters. For example, ''<U+015D>'' is represented by ''sh'', as in ''shi'' for ''<U+015D>i'' (she), and ''shanco'' for ''<U+015D>anco'' (chance).

Unfortunately this method suffers from several problems:

# ''h'' is already a consonant in the language, so digraphs occasionally make words ambiguous;
# another source of ambiguity is that ''<U+016D>'' is changed to simple ''u'', instead of using the available letter ''w'' or other unambiguous combination;
# simplistic [[ASCII]]-based rules for sorting words fail badly for sorting h-digraphs, because lexicographically words in ''<U+0109>'' should follow words all in ''c'' and precede words in ''d''. The word ''<U+0109>u'' should be placed after ''ci'', but sorted in the h-system, ''chu'' would appear before ''ci''.

=== The x-system ===

Main article: [[X-convention]]

A more recent system for typing in Esperanto is the so-called "x-system", which uses ''x'' instead of ''h'' for the digraphs, including ''ux'' for ''<U+016D>''. For example, ''<U+015D>'' is represented by ''sx'', as in ''sxi'' for ''<U+015D>i'' and ''sxanco'' for ''<U+015D>anco''.

X-digraphs solve those problems of the h-system:

# ''x'' is not a letter in the Esperanto alphabet, so its use introduces no ambiguity;
# words starting with ''cx'' are now nearly always correctly sorted after words starting with ''c''. The sorting only fails in the special case of a ''z''; for example, the compound word ''reuzi'' (to reuse) would be sorted after ''re<U+016D>matismo'' (rheumatism). Such cases are rare.

The x-system has become as popular as the h-system, but many people dislike it for its perceived "odd" appearance. Proponents argue that it would look "odd" only if one is expecting the appearance to resemble that of other European languages.

A practical problem of digraph substitution that the x-system does not completely resolve is in the complication of bilingual texts. ''Ux'' for ''<U+016D>'' is especially problematic when used alongside [[French language|French]] text, because many French words end in ''aux'' or ''eux''.  ''Aux'', for example, is a word in both languages (''a<U+016D>'' in Esperanto). Any automatic conversion of the text will alter the French words as well as the Esperanto.  A few English words like "auxiliary" and "Euxine" can also suffer from such search-and-replace routines.  A few people have proposed using "vx" instead of "ux" for ''<U+016D>'' to resolve this problem, but this variant of the system is rarely used.  Some systems use ''xx'' to escape the ''ux'' to ''<U+016D>'' conversion, e.g. "auxx" would produce "aux".

=== The caret system ===
Another, less popular, system is the use of the [[caret]] character (^) to represent the diacritics, either before or after the letter to be accented. For example, ''<U+015D>anco'' becomes ''^sanco'' or ''s^anco''. This shares the advantage of unambiguity with the x-system, and also has the advantage that the character itself resembles a circumflex accent, so that people unfamiliar with the system are likely to grasp what is meant. However, it has not caught on in many places, partially because it is regarded as aesthetically ugly, but also because it is cumbersome to type. It is primarily seen in introductions to Esperanto written in another language such as English, where introducing both the diacritics and the digraphs would be needlessly confusing. 

A variant<!-- Plena Analiza Gramatiko, end of section 4 --> proposes sliding the caret onto the following vowel, since the circumflex vowels of French are widely supported.
So, one would write ''eh<U+00F4>s<U+00E2>ng<U+00F4>j c<U+00EE>uj<U+00E2>ude'' for ''e<U+0125>o<U+015D>an<U+011D>oj <U+0109>iu<U+0135>a<U+016D>de.'' However, this proposal does not seem to have gotten off the ground. 

Many new Esperantists perceive the diacritics to be a problem, and often propose reforms to Esperanto orthography, sometimes with substantial modifications. Such proposals are ignored by the community, both because they generally come from people who do not know the language well, and because reform projects tend to snowball, a fate that has destroyed several constructed languages. 

The transliteration of Esperanto into ASCII is a topic known to cause [[flame war]]s with little constructive discussion. The reduction of such behavior is sometimes indicated as one of the main reasons to go to the extra effort of using the proper diacritics. With the advent of [[Unicode]], transliteration systems are no longer necessary on [[World Wide Web|web pages]]. Nonetheless, the h- and x-systems remain common on [[Usenet]] and in [[e-mail]], where encoding support is rare and the limited availability of keyboard configurations makes it difficult for many to type the diacritics.

== Unicode ==
The entire Esperanto alphabet is part of the [[ISO 8859-3|Latin-3]] and [[Unicode]] character sets, and is included in [[WGL4]]. 
The HTML entities for the special Esperanto characters in Unicode are:

*C-circumflex: &amp;#264;
*c-circumflex: &amp;#265;
*G-circumflex: &amp;#284;
*g-circumflex: &amp;#285;
*H-circumflex: &amp;#292;
*h-circumflex: &amp;#293;
*J-circumflex: &amp;#308;
*j-circumflex: &amp;#309;
*S-circumflex: &amp;#348;
*s-circumflex: &amp;#349;
*U-breve: &amp;#364;
*u-breve: &amp;#365;

=== Practical Unicode for Esperanto ===
====Microsoft Windows====
Adjusting a keyboard to type Unicode is actually relatively easy (all Windows variants of the [[Windows NT|Microsoft Windows NT]] family, such as 2000 and XP, for example, support Unicode; Windows 9x does not natively support [[Unicode]]).

[[Microsoft Windows]]: A page that describes how to use the excellent tool [http://www.tavultesoft.com/keyman/ Keyman] (free for personal use) in conjunction with a special (free) "keyword file" is available [http://zsigri.tripod.com/fontboard/espero.html here]. It can be configured to automatically run at startup. The advantage of using Keyman is that you can easily deactivate it, so your "abbreviations" (such as "cx," which are automatically converted to the corresponding Esperanto letter as you type) are not accidentally converted.

A similar tool to Keyman is [http://www.esperanto.mv.ru/Ek/ Ek], which is [[free software]] available without charge, and is widely used by Esperantists.

You can also use [http://klm.freeservers.com/ keyboard layout manager] to define special keys: the most elementary thing is associating AltGr+g to <U+011D> and similar ones. The program has a simple and intuitive interface, but it may be necessary to define a new keyboard to avoid interference from Windows' system-file protection system, that may not permit modifications of important system files as keyboard drivers.

Many popular e-mail clients support Unicode, so you can happily use the tools described above to write e-mails using the Esperanto alphabet.

If you want to use a text editor that is Esperanto-compatible, make sure it supports [[Unicode]], as do [[Editplus]] ([[UTF-8]]) and [http://www.esperanto.mv.ru/UniRed/ENG/index.html UniRed].

====Linux====
In [[Linux]] systems, configuration difficulty pretty much depends on whether your [[version|system version]] is old or new. This is so, because on old systems, it may be necessary to activate [[Unicode]] by setting the [[locale]] to a [[UTF-8]] locale. There is a special eo_XX.UTF-8 locale available at [http://bertilow.com/komputo/linukso.html Bertil Wennergren's home page], along with a thorough explanation of how one implements Unicode and the keyboard in Linux.

If the Linux system is recent, or kept updated, then the system is probably already working with Esperanto keys. For [[X Window System|X11]] and [[KDE]], it's only necessary to switch to a [[keyboard layout]] that has Latin [[dead key]]s (for example, the "US International" keyboard), whenever the user wants to write in Esperanto. Some keyboards with dead keys are those:

*In the US International keyboard, the dead circumflex is over the "6" key ("shift-6") and the dead breve is hidden over the "9" key ("altgr-shift-9").
*In the Brazilian ABNT2 keyboard, the dead circumflex has its own key together with dead tilde ("shift-~"), near the "Enter" key. The dead breve is hidden over the [[backslash]] ("altgr-shift-\") key.
*In the Portuguese keyboard, the dead tilde key, near the left shift key, has both the dead circumflex and the dead breve.

In [[GNOME]] and [[GTK+]] software, there exists a separate keyboard layout for Esperanto, replacing unused characters in Esperanto with the non-ASCII characters.

If necessary, install and use high quality fonts that have Esperanto [[glyph]]s, like Microsoft [[Core fonts for the Web|Web core fonts]] (free for personal use) or [[DejaVu]] (The [[Bitstream Vera]] glyphs have the [http://gnome.org/fonts Bitstream Vera license] and DejaVu extensions are in public domain).

====Mac OS X====
On [[Mac OS X]] systems, Esperanto characters can be entered by activating the ''U.S.&nbsp;Extended'' keyboard layout in the "Input Menu" pane of the "International" system preferences. 

When the ''U.S. Extended'' keyboard layout is active, Esperanto characters can be entered using multiple keystrokes using a simple mnemonic device: the 6 key contains the caret character, which looks like a circumflex, so option-6 places a caret over the following character; similarly, Option-b stands for ''breve'', so option-b adds the breve mark over the next character.

Swedish Esperantists using Mac OS X can use the Finnish Extended layout, which comes with the OS. Finnish has the same alphabet and type layout as Swedish; the Finnish Extended layout adds functionality just like U.S. Extended, only using other key combinations (the breve appears when you type option+y and the circumflex when you type a circumflex). 

Similarly, British users may use the Irish Extended layout, which differs from the U.S. Extended keyboard layout in several ways (preserving the simple option+vowel method of applying acute accents, important for the Irish language, and the <U+00A3> sign on shift-3 like the UK layout), but uses the same "dead-keys" for modifiers as U.S. Extended for Esperanto characters.

=== Locale ===
An Esperanto [[locale]] would use "." as the thousands separator and "," as a decimal point.  Time and date format among Esperantists is not as standardized as number format, but 24-hour time with colon between hour and minutes, and for dates, either yyyy-mm-dd or dd-mm-yyyy, would be international and unambiguous.

While the majority of written Esperanto uses the Latin Alphabet (including the Esperanto Wikipedia), the [[Shavian alphabet]] (which was originally designed for English) [[Shavian alphabet#.C5.9Cava alfabeto|has been modified for use in Esperanto]]. Since Esperanto writing is phonetic and there are no major accents, it is a fairly easy transliteration process.
