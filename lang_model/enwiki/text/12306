'''Interstate 375''' (I-375) in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], also known as '''North Bay Drive''', is a 1.34-mile-long spur route from [[Interstate 275 (Florida)|Interstate 275]] into downtown. It is also designated as the unsigned '''State Road 592'''.  There is a sibling segment of freeway nearby that is designated [[Interstate 175 (Florida)|I-175]].

==Route description==
Interstate 375 begins at an interchange with Interstate 275 (exit 23), heading east towards downtown St. Petersburg, with interchanges with 8th Street North/9th Street North, before ending at 4th Avenue North west of 4th Street North.  Westbound I-375 begins with a split of 5th Avenue North west of 4th Street North with no exits until reaching I-275.  Along with its sister highway [[Interstate 175 (Florida)|I-175]], I-375 lacks exit numbers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dot.state.fl.us/TrafficOperations/Operations/exitnumb/nchanges.shtm |title=Florida's Interstate Exit Numbers |publisher=[[Florida Department of Transportation]] | accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref>

==History==
===Original aspirations===
Interstate 375 was originally planned as a much longer, state highway, extending west of Interstate 275 and following a [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] rail line towards a proposed toll road near Clearwater.  When I-75 was relocated in the late 1970s/early 1980s, five miles (8&nbsp;km) of additional interstate became available, thus the St. Pete feeder sections of I-375 and the neighboring I-175 were upgraded to Interstate status.  However, the [[Interstate Highway]] standards at the time would not allow the I-375 extension to receive Federal Interstate Highway funding, leaving only the section east of I-275 built to freeway standards.  The planned freeway extension of I-375 was canceled by officials at the Department of Transportation in the mid 1970s.  The cancellation of the rest of Interstate 375 eventually resulted in [[U.S. Highway 19 (Florida)|US 19]] between [[State Road 694 (Florida)|Gandy Boulevard]] and the Pinellas-Pasco line being upgraded to freeway standards.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Contrary to popular belief, the [[ramp stub]] at the I-375 interchange was not a result of the failed freeway extension.  A connection to 20th St N was originally planned from this stub.  However, the 20th St N and 5th Ave N Intersection was already convoluted prior to I-275's construction and the [[Florida Department of Transportation]] decided not to build the connection as a result.

===2007 Tanker Incident===
[[Image:I-375 FL flyover april 2007.jpg|right|thumb|The I-275/I-375 junction during reconstruction of the damaged flyover (left)]]
On March 27, 2007, a [[tank truck|tanker]] entering I-375 east from I-275 south's left exit lost control and hit the [[retaining wall]], catching fire and burning for several hours.  The resulting fire became so intense, that it severely damaged a large section off the I-375 [[overpass]] from southbound I-275.  Intense flames also fell to a city-owned ([[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]]) construction equipment yard and destroyed 8 to 10 city vehicles, causing an estimated [[USD|$]]500,000 in damage to the yard.  The fire also spread to St. Petersburg's [[storm drain|stormwater system]], blowing off [[manhole]] covers within the vicinity.  One St. Petersburg police officer was injured as a result being struck by one of those manhole covers.<ref>[http://www.sptimes.com/2007/03/29/Tampabay/Crashed_tanker_unleas.shtml Crashed tanker unleashes blaze]</ref><ref>[http://www.tboblogs.com/index.php/newswire/story/tanker-truck-burns-on-i-275/ Grand Prix Fans Must Take Alternate Route]</ref>

In the end, the driver of the tanker died on-scene due to the fire. The I-375 overpass remained closed for almost four weeks while [[Florida Department of Transportation]] rebuilt the damaged sections of the bridge, reopening to traffic on the morning of April 22, 2007, about one week ahead of schedule. Reconstruction of the I-375 overpass included the rebuilding of one entire span, plus 11 concrete beams. In addition, one of the support columns underwent significant repairs to ensure its strength in supporting the roadway. FDOT placed signs along I-275 south, indicating the left exit onto I-375, due to this, as well as other fatal incidents that have occurred on the interchange.<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/1254701291.html?dids=1254701291:1254701291&FMT=FT&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+14%2C+2007&author=&pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&edition=&startpage=1.B&desc=AFTER+THE+INFERNO After the Inferno]</ref><ref>[http://www.tampabay.com/news/transportation/roads/article981504.ece Critics say I-375 exit ramp where three men have died is outdated and unsafe]</ref>
