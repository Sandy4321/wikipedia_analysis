{{History of Mongolia}}
After the downfall of the [[Xiongnu]], the [[Xianbei]] established domination in Mongolia in the 2nd century. They were consisted of [[Central Asia]]n [[Mongolic]] peoples. Under the leadership of their elected [[Khan (title)|Khan]], Tanshikhuai, who was the son of one of the military leaders, the Xianbei people were united around 150 AD and conquered almost all the former territories occupied by the Xiongnu. The remnants of the Xiongnu and the [[Wuhuan]] submitted under the rule of the Xianbei and contributed to their power. 

The Xianbei state comprised three sections: west, east and center headed by 12 chieftains. In the mid-3rd century, the Xianbei state began to split into number of smaller independent domains. The Muyun and the Toba, branches of the Xianbei people, established their dynasties in modern Inner Mongolian and Northern China. 

The economic base of the Xianbei was [[animal husbandry]] combined with agricultural practice. They were the first to develop the Khanate system<ref name="Wittfogel 1949 p. 1">Wittfogel, Karl August and Chia-sheng Feng (1949). History of Chinese society: Liao, 907<U+2013>1125. Philadelphia, American Philosophical Society distributed by the Macmillan Co. New York. p. 1.</ref>, in which formation of social classes deepened, and developments also occurred in their literacy, arts and culture. They used a zodiac calendar and favored song and music. Shamanism was the main religion among the Xianbei people. After they lost control over Mongolia, their descendants in [[North China]] became fully versed in Chinese cultural traditions later.<ref>Patricia Buckley Ebrey, Kwang-ching Liu - The Cambridge illustrated history of China</ref>. 

In 235, the Chinese [[Cao Wei]] that succeeded the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (25<U+2013>220A.D.) in northern China assassinated the last [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Xianbei]], [[Kebineng]], and caused disintegration in the [[Xianbei]] Kingdom<ref>L<U+00FC>, Jianfu [<U+5442><U+5EFA><U+798F>], 2002.
