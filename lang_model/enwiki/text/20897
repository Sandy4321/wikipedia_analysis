The '''College of All Saints''' was an [[collegiate church|ecclesiastical college]] in [[Maidstone]], [[Kent]], [[England]] founded in 1395 by [[William Courtenay|Archbishop Courtenay]]. It was part of the establishment of the nearby [[Archbishop's Palace, Maidstone|Archbishop's Palace]], but was closed in 1546. The College church was the neighbouring [[All Saints Church, Maidstone|Church of All Saints]]. Following its closure, the College estate was sold. The buildings and land passed through the ownership of three aristocratic families, being farmed until the late 19th century. A number of the College's buildings survive and all are [[listed building]]s. Additionally, the whole site of the College is protected as a [[scheduled monument]].

==History==
The College was founded by [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[William Courtenay]] in 1395.{{sfn|Hasted|1798|pp=308<U+2013>27}} Courtenay died in 1396 and the College and church were completed by his successor, [[Thomas Arundel]]. [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] endowed the College with land and income from the Hospital of St Peter and St Paul in Maidstone and from the parishes of [[Linton, Kent|Linton]], [[West Farleigh|Farleigh]], [[Sutton, Kent|Sutton]] and [[Crundale, Kent|Crundale]]. The College was also granted the [[advowson]]s for the parishes.{{sfn|Page|1926|pp=232<U+2013>33}} To cover the cost of building the College, Courtenay obtained a [[papal bull|bull]] to levy a charge of [[groat (coin)|fourpence]] in the pound on all ecclesiastical revenue raised in his [[archbishop]]ric.{{sfn|Hasted|1798|pp=308<U+2013>27}}{{#tag:ref|In Courtenay's time there were [[Coins of the pound sterling#Pre-decimal coinage|240 pence in the pound]]. The charge was therefore equal to 1.7% of income.|group="note"}} For most of its existence, the college had an establishment of a master and six chaplains.{{sfn|Poste|1847|p=10}}

When the College was closed in 1546 following the passing of the [[Chantry#Abolition of Chantries Acts, 1545 and 1547|Chantries Act]], its annual income was valued at <U+00A3>208 6[[Shilling (British coin)|s]] 2[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] (<U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|212.308|1547|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=-1}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{sfn|Hasted|1798|pp=308<U+2013>27}}{{sfn|Page|1926|pp=232<U+2013>33}}{{Inflation-fn|UK}} The church and the College were separated; the church became the parish church for the whole of Maidstone and the College and its lands were sold.{{sfn|Hasted|1798|pp=308<U+2013>27}} Sixteen members of the College's establishment were granted pensions totalling <U+00A3>100 17s.{{sfn|Poste|1847|p=35}}{{#tag:ref|The Master's pension of <U+00A3>48 16s 8d was almost half of the total sum.|group="note"}} In 1549, the College estate was granted to [[George Brooke, 9th Baron Cobham|George Brooke, Baron Cobham]] for the sum of <U+00A3>1081 18s 1d (<U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1081.904|1549|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=-1}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{sfn|Page|1926|pp=232<U+2013>33}}{{Inflation-fn|UK}}{{sfn|Poste|1847|p=56}} [[household silver|Plate]] and other valuables belonging to the College were sold for <U+00A3>200 (<U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|200|1549|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=-1}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{sfn|Page|1926|pp=232<U+2013>33}}{{Inflation-fn|UK}}{{sfn|Poste|1847|p=62}} 
[[File:College Road, Maidstone, 1866.jpg|thumb|College farm, 1866. Showing most of the buildings remaining today. The [[oast house]] on the left has been demolished.]]
Much of the Cobham family's estate was forfeited to [[the Crown]] in 1603 when his grandson, [[Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham|Henry Brooke, the 11th Baron Cobham]], was charged with [[high treason]] for his part in the [[Main Plot]] against [[James I of England|James I]].{{sfn|Hasted|1798|pp=308<U+2013>27}}{{sfn|Poste|1847|p=11}} The College was granted for life to the 11th Baron's wife after which it [[reversion (law)|reverted]] to [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], husband of Baron Cobham's sister.{{sfn|Poste|1847|p=11}} The College remained in the ownership of the Cecil family until 1697 when it was sold to Sir [[Sir Robert Marsham, 4th Baronet|Robert Marsham]] of [[Mote Park|Mote House]]. The College estate was subsequently owned by Marsham's heirs, the [[Earl of Romney|Earls of Romney]].{{sfn|Poste|1847|p=12}}

The College buildings were used as a farm into the 19th century, until the expansion of Maidstone led to their demolition as the neighbouring area was developed. Part of the site was developed in the late 19th century for the Cutbush Almshouses, a collection of grade II listed buildings.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1266502 |desc=Cutbush Almshouses |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref> The buildings are currently owned by [[Maidstone Borough Council]] having been donated to the borough by Sir Garrard Tyrwhitt-Drake, mayor of the borough in 1949<U+2013>50. A plaque commemorating the presentation is fixed inside the archway of the Gatehouse.

The College, like the Church of All Saints, is constructed of Kentish [[rag-stone]] in the [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular style]]. The main building, a two-storey structure with [[attic]], was mostly built in the 14th century and served originally as the Master's house. Some later 18th century alterations have been made and later windows added. The building contains a collar beam roof and a 16th-century staircase, moulded ceiling and [[aumbry]] cupboard.<ref name=college>{{NHLE |num=1225072 |desc=The College |accessdate=26 June 2011}}</ref> Poste records in his 1847 history of the College that some of the rooms retained traces of decorative wall painting.{{sfn|Poste|1847|p=22}}

The College Gateway to the north of the site is a three-storey rectangular tower with a two-storey stone-ribbed [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] archway through it with an exterior opening {{convert|8|ft|11|in}} wide with a pedestrian opening {{convert|4|ft}} wide alongside.<ref name=gateway>{{NHLE |num=1336234 |desc=The College Gateway (All Saints Parish Room) The College Tower |accessdate=26 June 2011}}</ref>{{sfn|Poste|1847|p=17}} The ground floor room to the east of the archway was the College bakehouse where evidence existed prior to the 1845 alterations of a large bakery oven. The room on the west side of the archway housed the porter.{{sfn|Poste|1847|p=19}} The roof of the gateway tower is [[hip roof|hipped]], projecting above a [[crenellation|crenellated]] parapet. A small turret is located in the south-west corner. Adjacent to the tower on the west side is a two-storey building that contained the College [[refectory]], kitchen and [[scullery (room)|scullery]] on the ground floor with a dormitory and infirmary on the first floor. Poste records that restoration and alterations carried out in 1845 included the removal of part of a range of rooms and cloisters attached to the main building as well as separate farm buildings including [[oast house]]s.{{sfn|Poste|1847|p=13}} On the north-west corner of this building is a small three-storey tower known as the River Tower or [[Muniment]] Tower.<ref name=gateway/> Poste records that around 1847 a peaked roof on the river tower was removed and replaced with a lower roof not visible above the parapet.{{sfn|Poste|1847|p=13}}

The two-storey Master's Tower was the original access to the College from the river. A single-storey structure is attached to the south side.<ref name=tower>{{NHLE |num=1086312 |desc=The Master's Tower |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref> The ruined gateway stands to the south separated from the other structures by the almshouses.<ref name=ruin>{{NHLE |num=1336235 |desc=The Ruined Gateway |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref> Poste records that in 1847 it stood between two barns, neither of which now remain.{{sfn|Poste|1847|p=28}} It consists of a pointed arch for carriages in a roughly coursed rag-stone wall flanked by buttress walls on each side.<ref name=ruin/>
