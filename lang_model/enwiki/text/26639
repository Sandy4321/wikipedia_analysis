{{French art history}}
:''For practical purposes, the history of French art has been divided into a series of separate articles accessible through the template to the right.  The template also gives direct access to French art category indexes, such as alphabetical lists of painters or sculptors.  To locate artists from a particular period or art movement, the relatively comprehensive manual list of painters and artistic movements in chronological order is recommended.  In addition to a brief historic overview, some supplementary or general material is included on this page, including art vocabulary and general French art references.''

'''French art''' consists of the [[visual arts|visual]] and [[plastic arts]] (including architecture, woodwork, textiles, and ceramics) originating from the geographical area of [[France]]. Historical surveys of French art typically begin with [[Pre-Romanesque art]], [[Romanesque art]], and [[Gothic art]], but some surveys, such as Andr<U+00E9> Chastel's ''French Art'', include discussions of [[prehistoric art]], [[Celtic art]], and [[Roman art]] within France.

==Historic overview==
===Prehistory===
Currently, the earliest known European art is from the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] period of between 40,000 and 10,000 years ago and France has a large selection of extant [[pre-historic art]] from the [[Ch<U+00E2>telperronian]], [[Aurignacian]], [[Solutrean]], [[Gravettian]], and [[Magdalenian]] cultures.  This art includes [[cave painting]]s, such as the famous paintings at [[Pech Merle]] in the [[Lot (d<U+00E9>partement)|Lot]] in [[Languedoc]] which date back to 16,000 B.C., [[Lascaux]], located near the village of [[Montignac, Dordogne|Montignac]], in the [[Dordogne]], dating back to between 13,000 and 15,000 B.C., or perhaps, as far back as 25,000 B.C., the [[Cosquer Cave]], the [[Chauvet Cave]], and the [[Trois-Fr<U+00E8>res|Trois-Fr<U+00E8>res cave]]; and [[portable art]], such as animal carvings and great goddess stauettes called [[Venus figurines]], such as the "[http://www.musee-antiquitesnationales.fr/pages/page_id18159_u1l2.htm Venus of Brassempouy]" of 21,000 B.C., discovered in the [[Landes]], now in the museum at the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. Ornamental beads, bone pins, carvings, as well as flint and stone [[arrowhead]]s also are among the prehistoric objects from the area of France.

[[Image:Lascaux.jpg|thumb|200px|Lascaux cave paintings]]

Speculations exist that only [[Homo sapiens]] are capable of artistic expression, however, a recent find, [[the Mask of La Roche-Cotard]]<U+2014>a [[Mousterian]] or [[Neanderthal]] artifact, found in [[2002]] in a cave near the banks of the [[Loire River]], dating back to about [[Paleolithic|33,000 B.C.]]<U+2014>now suggests that Neanderthal humans may have developed a sophisticated and complex artistic tradition.

[[Image:Carnac megalith alignment 1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''The Menec alignments'', the most well-known megalithic site among the Carnac stones]]

In the [[Neolithic]] period (''see'' [[Neolithic Europe]]), [[megalith]]ic (large stone) monuments, such as the [[dolmen]]s and [[menhir]]s at [[Carnac stones|Carnac]], [[Saint-Sulpice-de-Faleyrens]] and elsewhere in France begin to appear; this appearance is thought to start in the fifth millennium B.C., although some authors speculate about [[Mesolithic]] roots.  France has numerous painted stones, polished stone axes, and inscribed menhirs from this period.

In France from the Neolithic to the [[Bronze Age]], one finds a variety of archaeological cultures, including the [[R<U+00F6>ssen culture]] of c. 4500<U+2014>4000 B.C., [[Beaker culture]] of c. 2800 <U+2013> 1900 B.C., [[Tumulus culture]] of c. 1600-1200 B.C., [[Urnfield culture]] of c. 1300-800 B.C., and, in a transition to the [[Iron Age]], [[Hallstatt culture]] of c. 1200 - 500 B.C.  

For more on Prehistoric sites in Western France, ''see'' [[Prehistory of Brittany]].

===Celtic and Roman periods===
From the [[Proto-Celtic]] Urnfield and Hallstat cultures, a continental [[Iron age]] [[Celt]]ic art developed; mainly associated with [[La T<U+00E8>ne culture]], which flourished during the late Iron Age from 450 B.C. to the Roman conquest in the first century B.C.  This art drew on native, classical and perhaps, the [[Mediterranean]], oriental sources. The Celts of [[Gaul]] are known through numerous tombs and burial mounds found throughout France.  

[[Celtic art]] is ornamental, avoiding straight lines and only occasionally using symmetry, without the imitation of nature nor ideal of beauty central to the [[Classicism|classical]] tradition, but apparently, often involves complex symbolism. This artwork includes a variety of styles and often incorporates subtly modified elements from other cultures, an example being the characteristic over-and-under interlacing which arrived in France only in the [[sixth century]], although it was already used by [[Germany|Germanic]] artists.

The region of Gaul ([[Latin]]: ''Gallia'') came under the rule of the [[Roman Empire]] from the first century B.C. to the fifth century A.D. Monumental works from this period include the [[Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre antique d'Orange|amphitheater]] in [[Orange, Vaucluse]], the "[[Maison Carr<U+00E9>e]]" at [[N<U+00EE>mes]], the [[Pont du Gard]] [[aqueduct]], and the [[Thermes de Cluny|Roman baths]], and the [[Ar<U+00E8>nes de Lut<U+00E8>ce|arena]] of [[Paris]].

===Medieval period===
'''[[Merovingian art]]''' is the art and architecture of the [[Merovingian]] dynasty of the [[Franks]], which lasted from the [[fifth century]] to the [[eighth century]] in present day France and [[Germany]].  The advent of the Merovingian dynasty in [[Gaul]] during the [[fifth century]] led to important changes in the arts. In architecture, there was no longer the desire to build robust and harmonious buildings. Sculpture regressed to being little more than a simple technique for the ornamentation of [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], [[altars]], and ecclesiastical furniture. On the other hand, the rise of [[goldsmith|gold work]] and [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]] brought about a resurgence of [[Celt]]ic decoration, which, with [[Christian]] and other contributions, constitutes the basis of Merovingian art.  The unification of the [[Franks|Frankish]] kingdom under [[Clovis I]] (465&ndash;511) and his successors, corresponded with the need to build churches. The plans for them probably were copied from [[Roman architecture|Roman]] [[basilica]]s. Unfortunately, these timber structures have not survived because of destruction by fire, whether accidental or caused by the [[Normans]] at the time of their incursions.

[[Image:Karolingischer Buchmaler um 820 001.jpg|thumb|Aachen Gospels, c. 820, an example of Carolingian [[Illuminated manuscript|illumination]]]]

'''[[Carolingian art]]''' is the approximate 120-year period from [[750]] to [[900]]&mdash;during the reign of [[Charles Martel]], [[Pippin the Younger]], [[Charlemagne]], and his immediate heirs&mdash;popularly known as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]].  The Carolingian era is the first period of the Medieval art movement known as '''[[Pre-Romanesque art|Pre-Romanesque]]'''. For the first time, Northern European kings patronized classical Mediterranean Roman art forms, blending classical forms with Germanic ones, creating entirely new innovations in figurine line drawing, and setting the stage for the rise of [[Romanesque art]] and, eventually, [[Gothic art]] in the West.  

Illuminated manuscripts, metalwork, small-scale sculpture, mosaics, and frescos survive from the period.  The Carolingians also undertook major architectural building campaigns at numerous churches in France. These include, those of [[Metz]], [[Lyon]], [[Vienne]], [[Le Mans]], [[Reims]], [[Beauvais]], [[Verdun]], Saint-Germain in [[Auxerre]], Saint-Pierre in [[Flavigny]], and [[Saint-Denis]], as well as the town center of [[Chartres]]. The [[Centula Abbey]] of [[Saint-Riquier]] ([[Somme]]), completed in 788, was a major achievement in monastic architecture.  Another important building (mostly lost today) was "Theodulf's Villa" in [[Germigny-des-Pr<U+00E9>s]].

With the end of Carolingian rule around [[900]], artistic production halted for almost three generations.  After the demise of the Carolingian Empire, France split into a number of feuding provinces, lacking any organized patronage. French art of the tenth and eleventh centuries was produced by local monasteries to promote literacy and piety, however, the primitive styles produced were not so highly skilled as the techniques of the earlier Carolingian period. 

Multiple regional styles developed based on the chance availability of Carolingian manuscripts as models to copy, and the availability of itinerant artists. The monastery of Saint Bertin became an important center under its abbot Odbert (986-1007), who created a new style based on Anglo-Saxon and Carolingian forms. The nearby [[St. Vaast's Abbey|abbey of St. Vaast]] (Pas-de-Calais) also created a number of important works. In southwestern France a number of manuscripts were produced c. 1000, at the monastery of [[Saint Martial]] in [[Limoges]], as well as at [[Albi]], [[Figeac]], and [[Saint-Sever-de-Rustan]] in [[Gascogne]]. In Paris a unique style developed at the [[abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr<U+00E9>s]]. In [[Normandy]] a new style arose in 975.  By the later tenth century with the [[Cluny]] reform movement and a revived spirit for the concept of Empire, art production resumed.

'''[[Romanesque art]]''' refers to the art of Western Europe during a period of two hundred and fifty years, from approximately 1000 A.D. to the rise of the [[Gothic Art|Gothic style]], which arose in the middle of the twelfth century in France.  "Romanesque Art" was marked by a renewed interest in Roman construction techniques.  For example, the twelfth-century capitals on the cloister of [[Saint-Guilhem-le-D<U+00E9>sert]],  adopt an [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]]-leaf [[Motif (art)|motif]] and the decorative use of drill holes, which were commonly found on Roman monuments.  Other important Romanesque buildings in France include the abbey of [[Saint-Beno<U+00EE>t-sur-Loire]] in [[Loiret]], the churches of Saint-Foy in [[Conques]] of [[Aveyron]], Saint-Martin in [[Tours]], Saint-Philibert in [[Tournus]] of [[Sa<U+00F4>ne-et-Loire]], [[Abbey of Saint-Remi|Saint-Remi]] in [[Reims]], and [[Saint-Sernin Basilica|Saint-Sernin]] in [[Toulouse]].  In particular, [[Normandy]] experienced a large building campaign in the churches of [[Bernay]], [[Mont-Saint-Michel]], [[Coutances Cathedral]], and [[Bayeux]].

Most Romanesque sculpture was integrated into church architecture, not only for aesthetic, but also for structural, purposes.  Small-scale sculpture during the pre-Romanesque period was influenced by [[Byzantine]] and [[Early Christian]] sculpture.  Other elements were adopted from various local styles of Middle Eastern countries.  Motifs were derived from the arts of the "barbarian," such as grotesque figures, beasts, and geometric patterns, which were all important additions, particularly in the regions north of the Alps.  Among the important sculptural works of the period are the ivory carvings at the monastery of [[Abbey of St. Gall|Saint Gall]].  Monumental sculpture was rarely practiced separately from architecture in the Pre-Romanesque period.  For the first time after the fall of the Roman empire, monumental sculpture emerged as a significant art form.  Covered church [[facades]], doorways, and [[capitals]] all increased and expanded in size and importance, as in the [[Last Judgment]] Tympanum, [[Beaulieu-sur-Dordogne]], and the Standing Prophet at [[Moissac]].  Monumental doors, baptismal fonts, and candle holders, frequently decorated with scenes from biblical history, were cast in bronze, attesting to the skills of the contemporary metalworkers.  Frescoes were applied to the vaults and walls of churches. Rich textiles and precious objects in gold and silver, such as chalices and reliquaries, were produced in increasing numbers to meet the needs of the liturgy, and to serve the cult of the saints.  In the twelfth century, large-scale stone sculpture spread throughout Europe.  In the French Romanesque churches of [[Provence]], [[Burgundy]], and [[Aquitaine]], sculptures adorned the facades and statues were incorporated into the capitals.

[[Image:Figures from Cathedral of Chartres.JPG|thumb|right|The Western (Royal) Portal at Chartres Cathedral, ''c.'' 1145, these architectural statues are the earliest Gothic sculptures, a revolution in style and the models for a generation of sculptors]]

'''[[Gothic art]]''' and '''[[Gothic architecture|architecture]]''' were products of a Medieval art movement that lasted about three hundred years. It began in France, developing from the Romanesque period in the mid-twelfth century.  By the late fourteenth century, it had evolved toward a more secular and natural style known as, [[International Gothic]], which continued until the late fifteenth century, when it evolved further, into [[Renaissance art]].  The primary Gothic art media were [[sculpture]], [[panel painting]], [[stained glass]], [[fresco]], and [[illuminated manuscript]].

Gothic architecture was born in the middle of the twelfth century in [[<U+00CE>le-de-France (province)|<U+00CE>le-de-France]], when [[Abbot Suger]]  built the abbey at [[St. Denis]], ''c.'' 1140, considered the first Gothic building, and soon afterward, the [[Chartres Cathedral]], ''c.'' 1145. Prior to this, there had been no sculpture tradition in Ile-de-France&mdash;so sculptors were brought in from [[Burgundy]], who created the revolutionary figures acting as columns in the Western (Royal) Portal of Chartres Cathedral (''see image'') &mdash;it was an entirely new invention in French art, and would provide the model for a generation of sculptors.  Other notable Gothic churches in France include [[Cath<U+00E9>drale Saint-<U+00C9>tienne de Bourges|Bourges Cathedral]], [[Amiens Cathedral]], [[Notre-Dame of Laon|Notre-Dame de Laon]], [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in [[Paris]], [[Reims Cathedral]], the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in [[Paris]], [[Strasbourg Cathedral]].

The designations of styles in French Gothic architecture are as follows: Early Gothic, High Gothic, Rayonnant, and Late Gothic or "Flamboyant".  Division into these divisions is effective, but debatable.  Because Gothic cathedrals were built over several successive periods, and the artisans of each period not necessarily following the wishes of previous periods, the dominant architectural style often changed during the building of a particular building.  Consequently, it is difficult to declare one building as belonging to certain era of Gothic architecture.  It is more useful to use the terms as descriptors for specific elements within a structure, rather than applying it to the building as a whole.

The French ideas spread.  Gothic sculpture evolved from the early stiff and elongated style, still partly Romanesque, into a spatial and naturalistic treatment in the late twelfth and early thirteenth century. Influences from surviving ancient Greek and Roman sculptures were incorporated into the treatment of drapery, facial expression, and pose of the Dutch-Burgundian sculptor, [[Claus Sluter]], and the taste for naturalism first signaled the end of Gothic sculpture, evolving into the classicistic Renaissance style by the end of the fifteenth century.

Painting in a style that may be called, "Gothic," did not appear until about 1200, nearly fifty years after the start of Gothic architecture and sculpture. The transition from Romanesque to Gothic is very imprecise and by no means clearly delineated, but one may see the beginning of a style that is more somber, dark, and emotional than the previous period. This transition occurs first in England and France around 1200, in Germany around 1220, and in Italy around 1300.  Painting, the representation of images on a surface, was practiced during the Gothic period in four primary crafts, [[fresco]]s, [[panel painting]]s, [[manuscript illumination]], and [[stained glass]].  Frescoes continued to be used as the main pictorial narrative craft on church walls in southern Europe as a continuation of early Christian and Romanesque traditions. In the north, stained glass remained the dominant art form until the fifteenth century.

===Early Modern period===
{{main|French Renaissance}}
In the late fifteenth century, the French [[Italian Wars|invasion of Italy]] and the proximity of the vibrant [[Burgundy]] court, with its Flemish connections, brought the French into contact with the goods, paintings, and the creative spirit of the [[Northern Renaissance|Northern]] and [[Italian Renaissance]]. Initial artistic changes at that time in France were executed by Italian and Flemish artists, such as [[Jean Clouet]] and his son [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Clouet]], along with the Italians, [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Francesco Primaticcio]], and [[Niccol<U+00F2> dell'Abbate]] of what is often called the first [[School of Fontainebleau]] from 1531.  [[Leonardo da Vinci]] also was invited to France by Fran<U+00E7>ois I, but other than the paintings which he brought with him, he produced little for the French king.

[[Image:Meister der Schule von Fontainebleau 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|"Diane the Huntress" - School of Fontainebleau, 1550-60]]

The art of the period from Fran<U+00E7>ois I through Henri IV often is heavily inspired by late Italian pictorial and sculptural developments commonly referred to as [[Mannerism]], which is associated with [[Michelangelo]] and [[Parmigianino]], among others. It is characterized by figures which are elongated and graceful that rely upon visual [[rhetoric]], including the elaborate use of [[allegory]] and [[mythology]].  Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of the French Renaissance was the construction of the [[Ch<U+00E2>teaux of the Loire Valley]]. No longer conceived of as fortresses, such pleasure palaces took advantage of the richness of the rivers and lands of the Loire region and they show remarkable architectural skill.

{{main|French Baroque and Classicism}}
In the early part of the seventeenth century, late [[Mannerism|mannerist]] and early [[Baroque]] tendencies continued to flourish in the court of [[Marie de Medici]] and [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]].  Art from this period shows influences from both the north of Europe, namely the Dutch and Flemish schools, and from Roman painters of the [[Counter-Reformation]].  Artists in France frequently debated the contrasting merits of [[Peter Paul Rubens]] with his the Flemish baroque, voluptuous lines and colors to [[Nicolas Poussin]] with his rational control, proportion, Roman classicism.  

[[Image:Nicolas_Poussin_052.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Les Bergers d<U+2019>Arcadie]] by Nicolas Poussin]]

There was also a strong [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggisti]] school represented in the period by the amazing candle-lit paintings of [[Georges de La Tour]].  The wretched and the poor were featured in a quasi-Dutch manner in the paintings by the three [[Le Nain]] brothers.  In the paintings of [[Philippe de Champaigne]] there are both propagandistic portraits of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]' s minister [[Cardinal Richelieu]] and other more contemplative portraits of people in the Catholic [[Jansenist]] sect.

From the mid to late seventeenth century, French art is more often referred to by the term "Classicism" which implies an adherence to certain rules of proportion and sobriety uncharacteristic of the Baroque, as it was practiced in southern and eastern Europe during the same period.  Under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Baroque as it was practiced in Italy, was not in French taste, for instance, as  [[Bernini]]'s famous proposal for redesigning the Louvre was rejected by Louis XIV.  Through [[propaganda]], wars, and great architectural works, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] launched a vast program designed for the glorification of France and his name.  The [[Palace of Versailles]], initially a tiny hunting lodge built by his father, was transformed by Louis XIV into a marvelous palace for f<U+00EA>tes and parties, under the direction of architect [[Louis Le Vau]], painter and designer [[Charles Le Brun]], and the landscape architect [[Andr<U+00E9> Le N<U+00F4>tre]].

{{Main|French Rococo and Neoclassicism}}
[[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassicism]] are terms used to describe the visual and plastic arts and architecture in Europe from the late seventeenth to the late eighteenth centuries. In France, the death of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] lead to a period of freedom commonly called the [[R<U+00E9>gence]].  Versailles was abandoned from 1715 to 1722.  Painting turned toward "f<U+00EA>tes galantes", theater settings, and the female nude.  Painters from this period include [[Antoine Watteau]], [[Nicolas Lancret]], and [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Boucher]].  The [[Louis XV style]] of decoration, although already apparent at the end of the last reign, was lighter with pastel colors, wood panels, smaller rooms, less gilding, and fewer brocades; shells, garlands, and occasional Chinese subjects predominated.  Rooms were more intimate.

[[Image:Fragonard, Inspiration.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Inspiration by Jean-Honor<U+00E9> Fragonard]]

The latter half of the eighteenth century continued to see French preeminence in Europe, particularly through the arts and sciences, and the speaking the [[French language]] was expected for members of the European courts, hence the term, ''lingua franca'', for the accepted language.  The French academic system continued to produce artists, but some, such as [[Jean-Honor<U+00E9> Fragonard]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Sim<U+00E9>on Chardin]], explored new and increasingly impressionist styles of painting with thick brushwork.  Although the hierarchy of genres continued to be respected officially, [[Genre works|genre painting]], [[landscape]], [[portrait]], and [[still life]] were extremely fashionable.

One also finds in this period a ''Pre-romanticism'' aspect.  [[Hubert Robert]]'s images of ruins, inspired by Italian cappricio paintings, are typical in this respect.  So too the change from the rational and geometrical ''French garden'' of [[Andr<U+00E9> Le N<U+00F4>tre]] to the ''English garden'', which emphasized artificially wild and irrational nature.  One also finds in some of these gardens<U+2014>curious ruins of temples<U+2014>called "follies".

The middle of the eighteenth century saw a turn to [[Neoclassicism]] in France, that is to say a conscious use of Greek and Roman forms and [[iconography]].  In painting, the greatest representative of this style is [[Jacques Louis David]], who, mirroring the profiles of Greek vases, emphasized the use of the profile. His subject matter often involved classical history such as the death of Socrates and Brutus.  The dignity and subject matter of his paintings were greatly inspired by [[Nicolas Poussin]] in the seventeenth century.

===Modern period===
{{main|French art of the 19th century}}
The [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic wars]] brought great changes to the arts in France.  The program of exaltation and myth making attendant to the Emperor [[Napoleon I of France]] was closely coordinated in the paintings of Gros and Gu<U+00E9>rin.  Meanwhile, [[Orientalism]], Egyptian motifs, the tragic [[anti-hero]], the wild landscape, the [[historical novel]], and scenes from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance<U+2014>all these elements of [[Romanticism]]<U+2014>created a vibrant period that defies easy classification.

[[Image:Eug<U+00E8>ne Delacroix - Le Massacre de Scio.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''The Massacre at Scio - Eug<U+00E8>ne Delacroix]]

Romantic tendencies continued throughout the century, both idealized landscape painting and [[Naturalism (art)|Naturalism]] have their seeds in Romanticism. The work of [[Gustave Courbet]] and the [[Barbizon school]] are logical developments from it, as is the late nineteenth century [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] of such painters as [[Gustave Moreau]], the professor of [[Matisse]] and Rouault, as well as [[Odilon Redon]].

For many critics [[<U+00C9>douard Manet]] represents the division between the nineteenth century and the modern period (much as [[Charles Baudelaire]] does in poetry).  His rediscovery of Spanish painting from the golden age, his willingness to show the unpainted canvas, his exploration of the forthright nude, and his radical brush strokes are the first steps toward Impressionism.  [[Impressionism]] would take the [[Barbizon school]] one step farther, rejecting once and for all a belabored style and the use of mixed colors and black, for fragile transitive effects of light as captured outdoors in changing light (partly inspired by the paintings of [[J. M. W. Turner]]).  It led to [[Claude Monet]] with his cathedrals and haystacks, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] with both his early outdoor festivals and his later feathery style of ruddy nudes, [[Edgar Degas]] with his dancers and bathers.

After that threshold was crossed, the next thirty years became a litany of amazing experiments. [[Vincent van Gogh]], Dutch born, but living in France, opened the road to [[expressionism]].  [[Georges-Pierre Seurat|Georges Seurat]], influenced by color theory, devised a [[pointillism|pointillist]] technique that governed the Impressionist experiment. [[Paul C<U+00E9>zanne]], a painter's painter, attempted a geometrical exploration of the world, that left many of his peers indifferent. [[Paul Gauguin]], a banker, found symbolism in [[Brittany]] and then exoticism and primitivism in [[French Polynesia]]. [[Henri Rousseau]], the self-taught dabbling postmaster, became the model for the na<U+00EF>ve revolution.

{{main|French art of the 20th century}}

The early years of the twentieth century were dominated by experiments in colour and content that [[Impressionism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]] had unleashed.  The products of the far east also brought new influences. [[Les Nabis]] explored a decorative art in flat plains with the graphic approach of a Japanese print. At roughly the same time, [[Fauvism|Les Fauves]], exploded into color, much like German [[Expressionism]].

The discovery of African tribal masks by [[Pablo Picasso]], a Spaniard  living in Paris, lead him to create his ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' of 1907. Working independently, Picasso and [[Georges Braque]] returned to and refined C<U+00E9>zanne's way of rationally comprehension of objects in a flat medium, but their experiments in [[cubism]] also would lead them to integrate all aspects and objects of day to day life, [[collage]] of newspapers, musical instruments, cigarettes, wine, and other objects into their works. [[Cubism]] in all its phases would dominate paintings of Europe and America for the next ten years. (See the article on [[Cubism]] for a complete discussion.)

[[World War I]] did not stop the dynamic creation of art in France.  In [[1916]] a group of discontents met in a bar in Zurich, the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Z<U+00FC>rich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], and created the most radical gesture possible, the anti-art of [[Dada]].  At the same time, [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] were exploring similar notions. At a [[1917]] art show in [[New York City|New York]], Duchamp presented a white porcelain urinal (''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'') signed ''R. Mutt'' as work of art, becoming the father of the ''[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]]''.

When [[Dada]] reached Paris, it was avidly embraced by a group of young artists and writers who were fascinated with the writings of [[Sigmund Freud]], particularly by his notion of the [[unconscious mind]].  The provocative spirit of Dada became linked to the exploration of the unconscious mind through the use of [[automatic writing]], chance operations, and, in some cases, altered states.  The [[surrealism|surrealists]] quickly turned to painting and sculpture.  The shock of unexpected elements, the use of [[Frottage (surrealist technique)|Frottage]], [[collage]], and [[decalcomania]], the rendering of mysterious landscapes and dreamed images were to become the key techniques through the rest of the 1930s.

Immediately after this war the French art scene diverged roughly into in two directions.  There were those who continued in the artistic experiments from before the war, especially surrealism, and others who adopted the new [[Abstract Expressionism]] and [[action painting]] from New York, executing them in a French manner using [[Tachism]] or [[L'art informel]]. Parallel to both of these tendencies, [[Jean Dubuffet]] dominated the early post-war years while exploring child-like drawings, graffiti, and cartoons in a variety of media.

The late 1950s and early 1960s in France saw art forms that might be considered ''[[Pop Art]]''. [[Yves Klein]] had attractive nude women roll around in blue paint and throw themselves at canvases. [[Victor Vasarely]] invented [[Op-Art]] by designing sophisticated optical patterns. Artists of the [[Fluxus]] movement such as [[Ben Vautier]] incorporated [[graffiti]] and found objects into their work. [[Niki de Saint-Phalle]] created bloated and vibrant plastic figures. [[Arman]] gathered together found objects in boxed or resin-coated assemblages, and [[C<U+00E9>sar Baldaccini]] produced a series of large compressed object-sculptures.  In [[May 1968]], the radical youth movement, through their ''atelier populaire'', produced a great deal of poster-art protesting the moribund policies of president [[Charles de Gaulle]].

Many contemporary artists continue to be haunted by the horrors of the Second World War and the specter of the Holocaust. [[Christian Boltanski]]'s harrowing installations of the lost and the anonymous are particularly powerful.
