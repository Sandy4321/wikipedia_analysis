'''State Route 527''' (SR&nbsp;527, also known as the '''Bothell&nbsp;&ndash; Everett Highway'''<ref name="bothell-everett">{{cite news |title=WSDOT Detours Bothell&nbsp;&ndash; Everett Highway Near Silver Lake This Weekend |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/News/2005/04/Apr_25_05_SR527Detour.htm |publisher=[[Washington State Department of Transportation]] |date=2005-04-27 |accessdate=2008-10-07 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061001190301/http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/News/2005/04/Apr_25_05_SR527Detour.htm |archivedate = October 1, 2006}}</ref>) is a state highway in [[Snohomish County, Washington|Snohomish County]], of the U.S. state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. It extends {{convert|9.23|mi}} north from [[Interstate 405 (Washington)|I-405]] in the city of [[Bothell, Washington]], to an interchange with [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] (I-5), [[Washington State Route 99|SR&nbsp;99]], and [[Washington State Route 526|SR&nbsp;526]] in [[Everett, Washington]]. SR&nbsp;527 intersects [[Washington State Route 524|SR&nbsp;524]] and [[Washington State Route 96|SR&nbsp;96]] before ending in Everett. The route serves as a connector between Bothell, Everett, and [[Mill Creek, Washington|Mill Creek]].

The highway itself did not fully open until October 17, 1969, and, since its opening, has become increasingly congested, with about 57,000 motorists using the highway at its interchange with I-405 in 2004. A large construction project to widen the highway and put up [[sound wall]]s ran from 1991-2006.  A {{convert|2.69|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} section of the route was turned over to local authorities in 2011.
