'''Wyoming Highway 414''' is a {{convert|46.12|mi|km|1|sing=on}} [[Wyoming]] [[state road]] in eastern [[Uinta County, Wyoming|Uinta]] and extreme southwestern [[Sweetwater County, Wyoming|Sweetwater County]]. Although primarily a north-south route, Highway 414 travels in a more east-west orientation near its southern end.
==Route description==
Wyoming Highway 414 begins at the [[Utah]] State Line at [[Utah State Route 43]]. Utah State Route 43 connects Wyoming Highways 414 and [[Wyoming Highway 530|530]] at each routes respective terminus, intersecting Utah SR 44 in between. SR 43 enters from the south becoming Highway 414 as the highway enters [[Sweetwater County, Wyoming|Sweetwater County]]. WYO 414 turns west, passing through the small community of [[McKinnon, Wyoming|McKinnon]] before entering [[Uinta County, Wyoming|Uinta County]]. Still traveling west, Highway 414 then reaches [[Lonetree, Wyoming|Lonetree]] as it turns north toward [[Mountain View, Wyoming|Mountain View]].<ref name="googlemaps">{{google maps|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=WY-414+N&daddr=WY-412+N%2FWY-414+N&hl=en&ll=41.171418,-110.118713&spn=0.558217,1.234589&sll=41.357323,-110.334406&sspn=0.008697,0.01929&geocode=FYCTcQIdPPJz-Q%3BFQMOdwIdcWBs-Q&vpsrc=6&mra=mift&mrsp=1&sz=16&t=m&z=10|title=Overview Map of Wyoming Highway 414|accessdate=02 December 2011}}</ref> Nearing 40 miles into the route, WYO 414 turns west again and enters the town of Mountain View from the east. [[Wyoming Highway 410]] (2nd Steet) is intersected in town and provides travel to [[Robertson, Wyoming|Robertson]] and other outlying areas. Highway 414 now will travel due north for the remainder of its routing. [[Interstate 80 Business (Fort Bridger, Wyoming)|Interstate 80 Business]] is intersected at just over 3 miles later in [[Urie, Wyoming|Urie]], just east of [[Fort Bridger, Wyoming|Fort Bridger]] and west of [[Lyman, Wyoming|Lyman]]. Past Urie, WYO 414 reaches its end at exit 39 of [[Interstate 80 (Wyoming)|Interstate 80]] and the southern terminus of [[Wyoming Highway 412]]. The roadway continues north as WYO 412 to [[U.S. Route 189 (Wyoming)|US 189]]<ref name=googlemaps/><ref name="aaroads">[http://www.aaroads.com/west/wy-400.html Wyoming @ AARoads.com - Wyoming Routes 400-499]</ref>

==History==
Wyoming Highway 414 was formerly designated in [[Crook County, Wyoming|Crook]] County along present-day [[U.S. Route 212 (Wyoming)|U.S. Route 212]] in the northeastern corner of the state between 1936 and 1939. However that designation was replaced by US 212 when that route was extended into Wyoming and [[Montana]] from its prior end in [[Belle Fourche, South Dakota]].<ref name=aaroads/>
