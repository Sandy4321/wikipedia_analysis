'''Amanda Carter''' (born 16 July 1964) is an Australian Paralympic wheelchair basketball player. Diagnosed with [[transverse myelitis]] at the age of 24, she began playing wheelchair basketball in 1991 and participated in the [[Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team]], the Gliders, at three Paralympics from 1992 to 2000. An injury in 2000 forced her to withdraw from the sport, but she came back to the national team in 2009, and was a member of the team that represented Australia and won silver at the [[2012 Summer Paralympics|2012 London Paralympics]].

Due to her 2000 injury, Carter lost considerable mobility in her right arm, and required an elbow reconstruction. She spent 11 weeks on a [[continuous passive motion]] machine, and nine operations were required to treat the elbow. After her comeback in 2008, she played for the Dandenong Rangers in the Australian Women's National Wheelchair Basketball League (WNWBL), the team she had played for before her injury. That year she received a player award from the Dandenong Rangers and was named the [[Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) in her 1 point disability classification in the WNWBL and was named to the league's All Star Five. The Rangers won back to back WNWBL titles in 2011 and 2012, and she was again named the WNWBL MVP 1 Pointer and to the league's All Star Five in 2012.

During the match, she was knocked onto her right side, and her right arm became trapped underneath her wheelchair, causing a [[tendon]] in her elbow to rupture. [[Tracey Ferguson]], the Canadian player who knocked her down tried to block the way for Australian officials to help her up. Carter lost considerable mobility in her right arm, and required an elbow reconstruction. She spent 11 weeks on a [[continuous passive motion]] machine getting treatment. Nine operations were required to treat the elbow. Because she had a [[pre-existing condition]], the insurance company refused to pay for her treatment, although it paid her $7,500 in return for agreeing not to take legal action. Carter carried a lot of anger towards the Canadian in the first year following her accident. By 2004, she still could not fully flex her hand. Following her accident, she occasionally required the use of an electric wheelchair because of the severity of her injury, and needed the assistance of the Council's Home Care to clean her home. Before 2000, she had mostly been coached by national team coach Peter Corr.<ref name="APC"/><ref name=abcsource>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/sportsfactor/amanda-carter-and-alan-patching--a-couple-of-rare/3421938|title=Amanda Carter and Alan Patching ... a couple of rare gliders|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |work=The Sports Factor|year=2004 |accessdate=19 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews_interviews_Australian_Glider_Amanda_Carter |newspaper=[[Wikinews]] |date=28 September 2012 |title=Wikinews interviews Australian Glider Amanda Carter |accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref>

She quit the sport after being told that neither insurance nor the [[Australian Paralympic Committee]] would  cover her against injury during a tour in the United States, as her [[tendonitis]] was considered a there, and she would have to pay the costs for injury treatment herself. She quit wheelchair basketball.
