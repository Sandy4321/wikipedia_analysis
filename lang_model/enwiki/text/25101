'''John Alan Coey''' (12 November 1950 <U+2013> 19 July 1975) was an American-Rhodesian soldier who served in the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]] as one of "[[the Crippled Eagles]]", a loosely-organised group of American expatriates fighting for the [[list of states with limited recognition|unrecognised]] government of [[Rhodesia]] (today Zimbabwe) during that country's [[Rhodesian Bush War|Bush War]]. A devout Baptist and fervent anti-communist, Coey is described by historian [[Gerald Horne]] as a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] of the political [[Far-right politics|ultra-right]]. Coey moved to Rhodesia the day after graduating from college in his home town of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], Ohio, in early 1972, having attended officer training with the [[United States Marine Corps]] during his studies. He joined the [[Rhodesian Special Air Service]] (SAS) in March that year and served there until 1974, when he transferred to the Rhodesian Army Medical Corps and was posted to the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]] (RLI). Coey kept a journal from his first day in the army until his death. 

He passed out as a trooper in November 1972, and was recognised as one of the Rhodesian Army's best recruits of the year. However, an acrimonious fall from favour within the SAS because of his ideological and religious views caused him to be expelled from its officer training programme in October 1973, and ultimately to be forced out of the unit four months later. He redeployed to the Medical Corps and the RLI, where he was promoted to Corporal and engaged as an instructor and commando paramedic. Though not an officer, Coey exerted some influence on tactical doctrine, making numerous suggestions to his superiors and pioneering the [[combat medic]] role in the Rhodesian Army, which caused him to be nicknamed "the Fighting Doc". He was [[killed in action]] in the Kandeya Tribal Trust Lands in the country's north on 19 July 1975, shot through the head while running into the open to treat two fallen comrades. He was the first American fatality of the war. His journal and some of his letters home were compiled into book form by his mother, and posthumously published in 1988, under the title ''A Martyr Speaks''.

==Early life==

John Alan Coey was born in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], Ohio, on 12 November 1950 to George (commonly called "Ed") and Phyllis Coey, both devout [[Baptist]] Christians. While growing up, John was a keen [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] and attained the organisation's top rank, [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]. He attended [[Ohio State University]]'s campus in his home town, studying forestry, and during his studies enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]]' officer training program as a [[cadet]] in its [[Officer Candidates School (United States Marine Corps)#Platoon Leaders Class|Platoon Leaders Class]].<ref name=horne/> During this time he also taught at a local [[Sunday school]].<ref name="coey170">{{Harvnb

==Military career==
===Motivations===
Coey was on track to receive an officer's commission into the Marines as soon as he graduated from college, but he became severely disillusioned by the course of the [[Vietnam War]]. He believed that the American government had been infiltrated by communists, and was now working against the U.S. armed forces in south-east Asia to ensure a [[South Vietnam]]ese defeat. Positing that under these terms his own service would not benefit the United States or the West, Coey successfully requested a discharge from the Marine Corps just before he would have received his commission.<ref name="coey9">{{Harvnb
|Coey
|1988
|pp=7<U+2013>9}}</ref> Like his parents, he was a fervent Baptist, and held forthright views on communism, which he believed was an inherently evil system of government, geared towards the ultimate destruction of Christianity and the Western world; in his journal he writes of the "murder" of 65&nbsp;million people by communists in China and the Soviet Union since the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, "and the souls of millions more ... indoctrinated with atheism".<ref name="coey4">{{Harvnb
|Coey
|1988
|p=4}}</ref> In Coey's opinion, only the retention of a society rooted in traditional Western culture would prevent this from happening elsewhere.<ref name=coey4/> The young man's attention was caught by the situation in [[Rhodesia]] (modern-day Zimbabwe), where the [[list of states with limited recognition|unrecognised]] government, made up predominantly of the country's minority whites, was [[Rhodesian Bush War|fighting a war]] against black communist guerrillas who were attempting to topple it and forcibly introduce majority rule.<ref name="zanucommunique">{{Harvnb

|Cilliers

From his first day in the army, Coey kept a thorough journal of his thoughts and experiences.<ref name="horne">{{Harvnb

|Coey
|1988
|p=16}}</ref> "This action has cost me an Officer's Commission, and ... my citizenship may be revoked, [but] this is the most I can do for my country under the circumstances."<ref name=coey9/> He told African-American historian [[Gerald Horne]] that he believed communists had already compromised top levels of the American government, and that by serving in Rhodesia he was helping to unify "his people" against a foreign conspiracy.<ref name=horne/> His religious views also affected his views on [[Zionism]]: he believed that the State of Israel's existence prior to the [[Second Coming of Christ]] was contrary to the word of the Gospel, and therefore strongly opposed it.<ref name=horne/>

===Service===
[[File:Nyanga landscape.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount Nyangani|Mount Inyangani]], Rhodesia's highest peak. Coey climbed the mountain on 29 May 1972 as part of his SAS training. When he reached the top, he crudely tied an [[flag of the United States|American flag]] to a stick, planted it on the summit and posed beside it. The resulting photograph appears on the front cover of ''A Martyr Speaks''.<ref name="coey33">{{harvnb
|Coey
|1988
|p=33}}</ref>]]
Though foreign soldiers in the Rhodesian Army were only required to immediately commit to three years' service, Coey volunteered on arrival for at least five.<ref name=hitt/> He joined the [[Rhodesian Special Air Service|Special Air Service]] (SAS), an elite commando unit. He and the several other foreigners in his barrack room decorated their quarters with the flags of their countries of origin. Coey performed well during his initial training, and was recognised as one of the Rhodesian Army's top recruits of 1972; after passing out in November that year with the rank of Trooper, he was picked out in January 1973 for instruction as an officer. While training for this new role, he contributed articles to various Rhodesian and South African publications, sending work to the latter under the Afrikaans pseudonym "Johann Coetzee".<ref name=horne/> The political and religious views reflected in his journal continued: on 18 September 1973, he expressed profound joy at the [[1973 Chilean coup d'<U+00E9>tat|overthrow]] of Chile's Marxist president, [[Salvador Allende]], by his own military, and painted the incident as a victory for Christianity and the West.<ref name="coey121">{{harvnb
|Coey
|1988
|p=121}}</ref> In October 1973, Coey submitted an inflammatory article detailing his views on America's foreign policy to the Army magazine, ''Assegai''; the firmly anti-establishment piece, "The Myth of American Anti-communism", was deemed "subversive" by the Army, which blocked its publication. Coey was removed from the officer training programme soon after, officially because of his "temperament". Though disappointed by his expulsion, and suspicious about the true reasoning behind it, Coey did not complain, writing that as an ordinary trooper he would be free to broadcast his views to the public unhindered.<ref name="coey129">{{harvnb
|Coey
|1988
|pp=127<U+2013>129}}</ref>

Coey first saw combat action in November 1973, in a covert external operation in [[Portuguese Mozambique]]'s north-western [[Tete Province]].<ref name="coey129">{{harvnb
|Coey
|1988
|pp=127<U+2013>129}}</ref> He enjoyed it, comparing the experience to the [[American Indian Wars]] of the 19th century.<ref name=horne/> The following month, however, he was informed by his commanding officer that he would be not be used as a paratrooper, and would not be going on patrol again, as he was, in the commander's words, "not worth it".<ref name="coey147">{{harvnb
|Coey
|1988
|p=147}}</ref> Coey felt so humiliated that he considered leaving, but resolved to stay and fight on. Despite his commander's order to remain on base, he joined a patrol into Mozambique and crossed the border on 7 January 1974. The commanding officer flew into a rage when he discovered Coey's insubordination two weeks later, and immediately had him brought back.<ref name="coey152">{{harvnb
|Coey
|1988
|pp=150, 152}}</ref> Meanwhile, Coey persevered with "The Myth of American Anti-communism", and secured its publication in the conservative, nationally-distributed journal ''Property and Finance'' on 7 February 1974.  Five days later, he was barred from taking part in a parachute exercise with his unit, and on 14 February he was instructed to choose another Army corps or regiment by the 18th; the SAS no longer wanted him.<ref name="coey152">{{harvnb
|Coey
|1988
|pp=159<U+2013>160}}</ref>

Coey's request to transfer to the Rhodesian Army Medical Corps was granted, and a three-month medical course in Bulawayo was arranged for him accordingly, starting in April 1974. On its completion in July, he was promoted to Corporal and posted to the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]] (RLI) heliborne commando battalion, where he was installed as an instructor.<ref name="coey183">{{harvnb

They were later informally dubbed "[[the Crippled Eagles]]" by the American author [[Robin Moore]], who moved to Salisbury in August 1976 and became their unofficial patron.<ref name=horne236>{{harvnb

|Coey

|Coey
|1988
|p=83}}</ref>

Coey acquitted himself well in the eyes of his superiors following his move to the RLI, and soon after joining the unit mustered into Support Group as a specialist in [[Tracking (hunting)|tracking]], [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] and armoured vehicle driving, while also working as a medic.<ref name=horne/> He took part in over 60 [[Fireforce]] missions in this capacity, and became nicknamed "the Fighting Doc" because of his vehement insistence on joining such combat excursions.<ref name="coey242">{{harvnb

|p=242}}</ref> Although his political and religious views had prevented him from becoming an officer, he continued to make tactical suggestions to his superiors, some of which were adopted; for example, [[combat medic]]s were introduced to RLI patrols at his suggestion, and following his example. However, other ideas of Coey's&nbsp;<U+2013> such as his proposed use of [[psychochemical weapon]]s and the "weapon of starvation" against Mozambicans and Zambians&nbsp;<U+2013> were less well received.<ref name="therli">{{Harvnb

===Death===
[[File:Kandeya Tribal Trust Lands location (in red).png|thumb|The rough location of where Coey was killed is highlighted in red on this map.|alt=A map. See description]]
On 19 July 1975, a unit from the Rhodesian Territorial Force (TF) contacted a group of guerrillas near a river in the Kandeya Tribal Trust Lands, north-east of [[Mount Darwin, Zimbabwe|Mount Darwin]] in the area covered by Operation ''Hurricane''. After the Territorials killed two of the insurgents without loss, the cadres fell back and set up an ambush position underneath the roots of some overhanging trees on the riverbank. The TF patrol summoned a Fireforce made up of 7 and 10 Troops, 2 Commando, RLI from Mount Darwin, which arrived soon after. Coey, who was attached to 2 Commando at the time, accompanied 7 Troop as the patrol's combat medic. The Territorals and 10 Troop made a sweep of the river line, but on rounding a bend in the stream were suddenly fired upon by the hidden guerrillas. A sergeant from the TF was killed, as well as Rifleman Hennie Potgeiter of the RLI. RLI Rifleman Ken Lucas suffered a gunshot wound to the leg. The insurgents now held their fire to prevent giving their position away. Incorrectly believing from the inactivity that the cadres had fled, and thinking that the two fallen soldiers were still alive, Major Hank Meyer ordered the leader of 7 Troop, Lieutenant Joe du Plooy, to sweep around the river and send Coey out to treat the men.<ref name="binda164">{{harvnb
|Binda
|2008
|p=164}}</ref>

Lieutenant du Plooy led his men around the bend, carefully keeping them behind cover, then sent Coey out into the open riverbed to give treatment.<ref name=binda164/> With his [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] flag clearly visible,<ref name=horne/> Coey came out from cover and made for the bodies on the ground. The concealed cadres immediately opened fire and fatally shot him through the head. His lifeless body fell at du Plooy's feet. Coey was the first American fatality of the Rhodesian Bush War. The contact in which he died eventually ended with du Plooy and two other Rhodesians being wounded and a further Rhodesian soldier, Corporal Jannie de Beer, being killed. The insurgents escaped without any further loss to their number.<ref name=binda164/>

==Reactions to death, funeral and burial==

Coey's parents received letters of consolation from across the world, including one from [[Lester Maddox]], the [[List of Governors of Georgia|Governor of Georgia]], and another from the secretary of the far-right [[Liberty Lobby]]. Coey was never a member of any [[Political radicalism|radical]] political group, but his life and death were still used for [[propaganda]] reasons by some such movements: according to ''[[The Nation]]'', Coey was "eulogized in the American Nazi paper",<ref name="nation">{{harvnb
|The Nation
|1976
|p=429}}</ref> and on 4 July 1976, [[Willis Carto]] of the Liberty Lobby announced a posthumous award to Coey to commemorate the bicentenary of the United States.<ref name="coey235246">{{harvnb
|Coey

{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%|quote=[Coey was] almost hysterical with anxiety about Chinese influence in the region ... by the spring of 1974 his worries had become almost delusional ... [his] anti-communism was mixed liberally with white supremacy, for the arrival of the communists meant the rule of Africans, the falling of 'standards' and the collapse of 'civilization'. To prevent this catastrophe, any amount of brutality could be rationalized ... Coey was part of the ultra-right ... He was given the dubious honor of being regarded as the first U.S. citizen to die fighting for Rhodesia during the war.|source=<small>Historian [[Gerald Horne]] describes Coey<ref name=horne/></small>|quoted = 1}}
On 28 July 1975, Coey received a full military funeral and was buried in the central Rhodesian town of [[Kwekwe|Que Que]], where he had been living. With his parents standing by, Coey's brother, E. George, gave an eloquently-worded eulogy, which strongly stressed his family's religious and ideological beliefs&nbsp;<U+2013> he said that his brother had achieved "the greatest of Christian virtues: sacrifice".<ref name="coey233234">{{harvnb
|Coey
|1988
|pp=233<U+2013>234}}</ref> When the family returned to Ohio, Phyllis Coey compiled her son's journal and a selection of his letters home into a book entitled ''A Martyr Speaks'', which she first attempted to have published in 1975. Because of the controversial views it contained (including Coey's dedication of his journal "to the 100,000 American dead [[Korean War|of Korea]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] who were betrayed by their own government"<ref name="coeyii">{{harvnb
|Coey
