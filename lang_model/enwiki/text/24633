'''Varian Associates''' was one of the first [[high-tech]] companies in [[Silicon Valley]].  It was founded in 1948 by [[Russell Varian|Russell H.]] and [[Sigurd Varian|Sigurd F. Varian]], [[William Webster Hansen]], and [[Edward Ginzton]] to sell the [[klystron]], the first tube which could generate electromagnetic waves at microwave frequencies, and other electromagnetic equipment. Varian Associates split into three companies in 1999.

==Incorporation and leadership==
On April 20, 1948, the Articles of Incorporation were filed, signed by nine directors:  [[Edward Ginzton]], , who had worked with the Varian brothers since his days as a doctoral student; [[William Webster Hansen]], [[Richard M. Leonard]], an attorney; [[Leonard I. Schiff]], then head of the physics department at [[Stanford University]]; H. Myrl Stearns, [[Russell and Sigurd Varian|Russell H. Varian]], his wife, Dorothy Varian, [[Russell and Sigurd Varian|Sigurd F. Varian]] and Paul B. Hunter. The company began with six full-time employees: the Varian brothers, Dorothy, Myrl Stearns, Fred Salisbury, and Don Snow. Technical and business assistance came from several members of the faculty at Stanford University, including Edward Ginzton, Marvin Chodorow, William Hansen, and Leonard Schiff.  The company's legal counsel was Dick Leonard, a San Francisco attorney, and Paul Hunter, a patent attorney, handled matters related to patents and intellectual property rights.<ref name="Early History">[http://www.varianinc.com/cgi-bin/nav?/corp/history  Varian, Inc.  An Early History]</ref> Francis Farquhar, an accountant and friend of Russell's from the [[Sierra Club]], later became a director, as did [[Frederick Terman]], Dean of Engineering at Stanford, and [[David Packard]], of [[Hewlett-Packard]].<ref name=Lecuyer100>Lecuyer, page 100</ref>  Russell served as the company President and a board member until his death;<ref name=Peterson>Peterson, p. 960</ref> Sigurd served as Vice-President for Engineering, and served on the Board of Directors until his death, sometimes serving as Chairman of the Board.<ref name=SVEC>[http://www.svec.org/print.html?id=60 "1993 Hall of Fame Recipients" Silicon Valley Engineering Council]</ref> Following the deaths of both Varian brothers, Ginzton became the CEO of the company.<ref name=Chem/>

Under Thomas D. Sege, the company's chief executive officer (CEO) from 1981 to 1990, sales grew to exceed $1 billion per annum.  In 1990 J. Tracy O'Rourke replaced Sege as CEO and was also made chairman of the board. 

==Early projects and goals==

One of Varian Associates' major contracts in the 1950s was to create a fuse for the [[atomic bomb]].  The Varian brothers had initially been supportive of military applications for the klystron and other technologies, on the grounds that they were primarily defensive weapons.  This contract, however, was different.  Although politically progressive to the point of having socialist leanings, the Varians were patriotic at heart and had no sympathy for the Marxist model of socialism practiced by the [[Soviet Union]].  They also needed military contracts to survive and relished the technical challenges of this sort of work, but as early as 1958 Russell and Sigurd expressed regret for their involvement in the development of weapons of mass destruction.<ref name=Lecuyer101/><!--this source for entire paragraph-->

Most of the founders of Varian Associates, had [[Progressivism|progressive]] political leanings,<ref name=Lecuyer94>Lecuyer, p. 94</ref> and the company "pioneered profit-sharing, stock-ownership, insurance, and retirement plans for employees long before these benefits became mandatory".<ref name=SVEC/> Nearly 50 years later, in 1997, the company was still recognized by ''[[Industry Week]]'' as one of the best-managed companies in America.<ref name=Congressional/>  Among their early employees was bookkeeper Clara Jobs, mother of [[Steve Jobs]].<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/the-steve-jobs-nobody-knew-20111012 "The Steve Jobs Nobody Knew."

==Location==
The company was initially headquartered in [[San Carlos, California]],<ref name=Lecuyer101>L<U+00E9>cuyer, p. 101-103</ref> and started with only $22,000 in funding.<ref name=Lecuyer100/>  It had problems raising additional capital, particularly due to Russell's insistence that the company be owned by its employees and his related refusal to accept outside investors.<ref name=Lecuyer101/> Hansen mortgaged his home for $17,000 to raise additional cash, and the group sought out additional funds from their friends.<ref name=Lecuyer101/> Ultimately, however, the company raised $120,000 of necessary capital via an offer of stock to all employees, directors, consultants, and a few sympathetic local investors who shared the company's goals.<ref name=Lecuyer101/>  Military contracts for technology deemed necessary during the [[Cold War]], including some classified projects, also helped the firm succeed.<ref name=Lecuyer101/>  In 1953, Varian Associates moved its headquarters to [[Palo Alto, California]],<ref>[http://www.cpii.com/history.cfm Early history of Varian Associates], Communications & Power Industries. Accessed April 27, 2011</ref> at Stanford Industrial Park &ndash; noted as the "spawning ground of Silicon Valley" &ndash; and was the first firm to occupy a site there.<ref name=SVEC/> 

On April 2, 1999, the company spun off its Gloucester, Massachusetts ion-implantation equipment business into [[Varian Semiconductor|Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates]] and its Palo Alto based scientific instrument business into [[Varian, Inc.]] The medical equipment business, which included the manufacture of x-ray tubes in Salt Lake City, Utah, renamed itself [[Varian Medical Systems]], Inc. and remained headquartered in Palo Alto.  After the breakup O'Rourke served as Varian Semiconductor's chairman.  [[Varian, Inc.]], was later acquired by [[Agilent Technologies]] in May, 2010.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20101112-709484.html Agilent's 4Q Profit Soars, Topping Views; Forecast Upbeat ]</ref>

==Legacy==
In 1998, the [[Congressional Record]] noted the 50th anniversary of the founding of Varian Associates, which then employed 7,000 people at 100 plants in nine countries.  It had branched out into health care systems, analytical equipment and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. California Representative [[Anna Eshoo]] stated that the company had been awarded over 10,000 patents and was a "jewel in the crown of...Silicon Valley."<ref name=Congressional>Eshoo, Anna.
