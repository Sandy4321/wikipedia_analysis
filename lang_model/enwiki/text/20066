==Lambeth's recent political history==

In 1979 the administration of [[Ted Knight (politician)|Edward "Red Ted" Knight]] organised the borough<U+2019>s first public demonstration against the Thatcher government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://briandeer.com/kate-hoey.htm |title=Kate Hoey MP and Lambeth Labour Party - Brian Deer investigates |publisher=Briandeer.com |date=1993-08-08 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}</ref>

In 1985, the left-wing Labour administration of Ted Knight was subjected to 'rate-capping' with its budget restricted by the Government. Knight and most of the Labour councillors [[rate-capping rebellion|protested by refusing to set any budget]]. This protest resulted in 32 councillors being ordered to repay to the council the interest the council had lost as a result of budgeting delays, and also being disqualified from office.

1991 saw [[Joan Twelves]]<U+2019>s regime both failed to collect the poll tax and openly opposed the war in the [[Persian Gulf]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://briandeer.com/kate-hoey.htm |title=Kate Hoey MP and Lambeth Labour Party - Brian Deer investigates |publisher=Briandeer.com |date=1993-08-08 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}</ref> Joan Twelves, and 12 other councillors were subsequently suspended from the labour party<U+2019>s local group by regional officials for advocating non- payment of the poll tax and other radical ideas in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|author=Will Bennett |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-rise-and-fall-of-red-teds-loony-lefties-1593657.html |title=The rise and fall of Red Ted's loony lefties - News |publisher=The Independent |date=1995-07-29 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}</ref>

Joan's equily militant deputy leader in this era was [[John Harrison (Lambeth)|John Harrison]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glatuc.org.uk/news_gn.php |title=GLATUC News |publisher=Glatuc.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20}}</ref>
