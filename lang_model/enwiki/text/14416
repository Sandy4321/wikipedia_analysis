The '''1933 Cuba&ndash;Brownsville hurricane''' was one of two storms in the [[1933 Atlantic hurricane season]] to reach the intensity of a [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5]] strength on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. It formed on August&nbsp;22 off the west coast of Africa, and for much of its duration it maintained a west-northwest track. The system intensified into a tropical storm on August&nbsp;26 and into a hurricane on August&nbsp;28. Passing north of the [[Lesser Antilles]], the hurricane rapidly intensified as it approached the [[Turks and Caicos]] islands. It reached Category&nbsp;5 status and its peak winds of {{convert|160|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on August&nbsp;31. Subsequently, it weakened before striking northern Cuba on Septmeber&nbsp;1 with winds of {{convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. In the country, the hurricane left about 100,000&nbsp;people homeless and killed over 70&nbsp;people. Damage was heaviest near the storm's path, and the strong winds destroyed houses and left areas without power. Damage was estimated at $11&nbsp;million.{{#tag:ref|All damage totals are in 1933 [[United States dollar]]s unless otherwise noted.|group="nb"}} 

After exiting from Cuba, the hurricane entered the Gulf of Mexico and restrengthened. On Septmeber&nbsp;2, it re-attained winds of {{convert|140|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Initially the hurricane posed a threat to the area around [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], and the local [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|United States Weather Bureau]] forecaster advised people to stay away from the Texas coastline during the busy [[Labor Day|Labor Day Weekend]]. Officials declared martial law in the city and mandated evacuations. However, the hurricane turned more to the west and struck near [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]] early on September&nbsp;5 with winds estimated at 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h). It quickly dissipated after causing heavy damage in the [[Rio Grande Valley]]. High winds caused heavy damage to the citrus crop. The hurricane left $16.9&nbsp;million in damage and 40&nbsp;deaths in southern Texas.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|1933 Atlantic hurricane 10 track.png}}
The origins of the hurricane were from a tropical disturbance near the west coast of Africa on August&nbsp;20. Two days later, the system organized enough to be classified a tropical depression just southwest of [[Cape Verde]]. For the next few days, the system moved west-northwestward with little change in intensity. It is estimated the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August&nbsp;26, about halfway between the [[Lesser Antilles]] and Cape Verde. Initially, the storm was elongated, although beginning on August&nbsp;28 it began to intensify more quickly. That night, the storm attained hurricane status, and many nearby ships reported gale force winds.<ref name="meta">{{cite report|author=Chris Landsea, et al.|date=May 2012|title=Documentation of Atlantic Tropical Cyclones Changes in HURDAT (1933)|publisher=Hurricane Research Division|accessdate=2012-06-02|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/metadata_1933.html#1933_8}}</ref> 

On August&nbsp;29, the hurricane passed north of the Lesser Antilles as it approached the southeastern [[Bahamas]]. It underwent [[rapid deepening]]: in a 24&nbsp;hour period beginning late on August&nbsp;29, the winds increased from 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h) to 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h). It also became a small storm, as [[Grand Turk Island]] reported winds of {{convert|56|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} while the hurricane passed slightly to the north on August&nbsp;30. At 0130&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] the next day, a ship near [[Mayaguana]] reported a [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] of {{convert|930|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} and hurricane-force winds. The pressure would ordinarily suggest winds of {{convert|152|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, but because it was not reported in the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] and the storm was smaller than normal, the winds were estimated at {{convert|160|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The hurricane's winds rank as a [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5]] on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]], one of two such storms in the 1933 season.<ref name="meta"/>

After maintaining peak winds for about 12&nbsp;hours, the hurricane began weakening as it passed through the southern Bahamas. At around 1200&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;1, the hurricane made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on northern Cuba near [[Sagua La Grande]], with winds of about {{convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The eye moved along the northern coast of Cuba, crossing over [[Matanzas]]. Shortly thereafter the storm exited into the [[Straits of Florida]], and late on September&nbsp;1 the hurricane passed about {{convert|16|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Havana]]. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane restrengthened, and a ship reported a pressure of {{convert|948|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} late on September&nbsp;2; this suggested winds of about {{convert|140|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The hurricane turned more to the west on September&nbsp;3, and as it approached southern Texas it weakened slightly as it decelerated. At 0400&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;5, the hurricane made its final landfall on [[South Padre Island]] in southern Texas, with winds estimated at 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h). It quickly weakened over land as it crossed into northeastern Mexico, and the storm dissipated late on September&nbsp;5.<ref name="meta"/>

While the hurricane was over the Bahamas late on August&nbsp;30, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|United States Weather Bureau]] issued [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|storm warnings]] for southern Florida. Two days later, the storm struck Cuba and passed south of the state, producing peak winds of {{convert|42|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in [[Key West, Florida|Key West]].<ref name="mwr">{{cite journal|author=R.

High waves also sank a boat, killing three people.<ref name="loc"/>

Three days before the hurricane made its final landfall, officials at the Weather Bureau in Brownsville issued a warning to all stations along the Texas coast, declaring that it was "uncertain where tropical storm in Gulf will reach coast line, but all persons should be warned to remain away from inaccessible places on Texas coast over week end." The early warning was to prevent travelers from being on the Texas beaches on [[Labor Day|Labor Day Weekend]]. As a result, an official at the [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] Weather Bureau office estimated that the warning "probably saved thousands of lives." Early on September&nbsp;4<!--local time--> about a day before landfall, the Weather Bureau issued a hurricane warning from Corpus Christi to [[Freeport, Texas|Freeport]] and storm warnings for other locations along the Texas coast. When the storm's westward motion became more apparent, the hurricane warning was dropped north of Corpus Christi and extended southward to Brownsville.<ref name="mwr"/> Officials in Corpus Christi declared [[martial law]] before the storm struck and ordered mandatory evacuations of low-lying areas. Shelters opened in the city, and many businesses closed.<ref name="corp">{{cite report|publisher=Corpus Christi National Weather Service|date=February 2000|title=Hurricane #11, 1933|accessdate=2012-06-09|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20081108233410/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/crp/docs/research/hurrhistory/1933-11.html}}</ref>
