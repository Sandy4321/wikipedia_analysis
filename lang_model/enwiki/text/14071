'''Fernanda Bertini Vi<U+00E9>gas''' is a [[Brazil]]ian scientist and designer whose work focuses on the social, collaborative, and artistic aspects of information visualization. Vi<U+00E9>gas received a Ph.D. in [[Media Arts and Sciences]] from the [[MIT Media Lab]] in 2005. The same year she began work at the [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] location of IBM's [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]] as part of the Visual Communication Lab. In April 2010, she and [[Martin M. Wattenberg]] started a new venture called Flowing Media, Inc., to focus on visualization aimed at consumers and mass audiences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hint.fm/blog/2010/04/08/a-new-chapter/ |title=A New Chapter <U+2014> Visual Hint |publisher=Hint.fm |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}</ref> Four months later, both of them joined Google as the co-leaders of the Google's "Big Picture" data visualization group in Cambridge, MA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hint.fm/blog/2010/08/05/that-was-fast/ |title=That was fast! <U+2014> Visual Hint |publisher=Hint.fm |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fernandaviegas.com/bio.html |title=Fernanda B.

== Social visualization ==
Vi<U+00E9>gas began her research while at the [[MIT Media Lab]], focusing on [[graphical interface]]s for [[online communication]]. Her Chat Circles system introduced ideas such as [[proximity-based filtering]] of conversation and a visual archive of [[chat]] history displaying the overall rhythm and form of a conversation.<ref>''Chat Circles''. Fernanda B. Vi<U+00E9>gas and Judith Donath. ACM Conference on Computer-Human Interaction (CHI), 1999</ref> Her [[email]] visualization designs (including PostHistory and Themail) are the foundation for many other systems; her findings on how visualizations are often used for storytelling influenced subsequent work on the collaborative aspects of visualization.<ref>Baby Names, Visualization, and Social Data Analysis Martin Wattenberg. InfoVis 2005</ref> While at MIT, she also studied usage of [[Usenet]] and [[blog]]s.<ref>Jeffrey Rosen, [http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/19/magazine/19PHENOM.html Your Blog or Mine?], ''New York Times Magazine'', December 19, 2004</ref>

== Collective intelligence and public visualization ==

A second stream of work, in partnership with [[Martin M. Wattenberg|Martin Wattenberg]], centers on collective intelligence and the public use of data visualization.

Her work with visualizations such as [[History Flow]] and [[Chromogram]] led to some of the earliest publications on the dynamics of Wikipedia, including the first scientific study of the repair of [[vandalism]].<ref>2004: Studying Cooperation and Conflict between Authors with history flow Visualizations.

Vi<U+00E9>gas is one of the founders of IBM's experimental [[Many Eyes]] web site, created in 2007,<ref>Anne Eisenberg, [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/31/technology/31novel.html Lines and Bubbles and Bars, Oh My! New Ways to Sift Data], ''New York Times'', August 30, 2008</ref><ref>Folha de Sao Paulo, [http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/informatica/ult124u462872.shtml Many Eyes <U+00E9> cria<U+00E7><U+00E3>o de brasileira], November 1, 2008'.</ref> which seeks to make visualization technology accessible to the public. In addition to broad uptake from individuals, the technology from Many Eyes has been used by nonprofits and news outlets such as the New York Times Visualization Lab.<ref>[http://vizlab.nytimes.com/ New York Times Visualization Lab]</ref>

== Art ==
Vi<U+00E9>gas is also known for her artistic work, which explores the medium of visualization for explorations of emotionally charged digital data. An early example is Artifacts of the Presence Era, an interactive installation at the Boston Center for the Arts in 2003, which featured a video-based timeline of visitor interactions with the museum. She often works with Martin Wattenburg to visualize emotionally charged informaion. An example of these works is their peice "Web Seer", which is a visualization of gole suggest.<ref>http://fernandaviegas.com/art.html</ref> The Fleshmap series (started in 2008) uses visualization to portray aspects of sensuality, and includes work on the web, video, and installations.<ref>Cate McQuaid, [http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2009/04/29/inside_squash_art_and_sport_confined/ Inside squash: art and sport confined], ''Boston Globe'', April 29, 2009</ref> In 2012, she launched the [http://hint.fm/wind Wind Map project],<ref>"The Week In Ideas - On With The Wind", The Wall Street Journal, April 6, 2012.</ref> which displays continuously updated forecasts of wind patterns across the United States. In addition to these works she also
