'''Rickenbacker''' (pronounced rick-en-BACK-er [http://www.rickenbacker.com/faq_item.asp?faq_id=2]) is an electric guitar manufacturer. All production takes place at its headquarters in [[Santa Ana, California]].  Rickenbacker is the largest guitar company to manufacture all of their guitars within the United States.

== Founding ==
[[Image:Rickenbackerfryingpan.jpg|thumb|left|Rickenbacker frying pan]]
[[Image:rickenbackerfryingpanpatentsketch.jpg|right|thumb|Sketch of Rickenbacker "frying pan" lap steel guitar from 1937 patent application]]
The company was founded as the '''''Electro String Instrument Corporation''''' by [[Adolph Rickenbacher]] and [[George Beauchamp]] in [[1931]] to sell electric "Hawaiian" guitars designed by Beauchamp. They chose the brand name '''''Rickenbacher''''' (later changed to '''''Rickenbacker''''') for these guitars.  

These instruments, nicknamed "frying pans" due to their long necks and circular bodies, are considered by some to be the first [[solid body|solid-bodied]] [[electric guitar]]s, though they were not standard [[guitar]]s, but a [[Lap steel guitar|lap-steel]] type. They had huge pickups with a pair of horseshoe magnets that arched over the top of the strings. By the time production ceased in 1939, several hundred thousand had been produced.

== Early history ==

Rickenbacher (shortly afterwards changed to 'Rickenbacker' to avoid [[Germany|German]] connotations in light of the [[world war]]s, as well as to capitalize on the distant relation between the company owner and WWI flying ace [[Eddie Rickenbacker]]) continued to specialize in steel guitars well into the [[1950s]], but with the [[rock and roll]] boom they shifted towards producing standard guitars, both acoustic and electric. In 1956, Rickenbacker introduced two instruments with the "neck through body" construction that was to become a standard feature of the company's products <U+2014> the Combo 400 guitar and the model 4000 bass.

In 1959, Rickenbacker introduced its "Capri" series, including the double-cutaway semi-acoustic guitars which would become the famous 300 series.
In [[1964]] Rickenbacker developed an electric twelve-string guitar with an innovative headstock design that enabled all twelve [[machine head]]s to be fitted onto a standard-length headstock by alternately mounting pairs of machine heads at right-angles to the other.

== Rickenbacker Guitars and the Rock & Roll Explosion of the 1960s ==

During the 1960s, with luck on their side, Rickenbacker would go on to enjoy an incredible endorsement when a couple of Rickenbacker models became permanently intertwined with the sound and look of the most popular band of the 1960s and, considered by some, to be the most influential band of the 20th century: [[The Beatles]].

[[Image:Beatlessullivansinging.jpg|thumb|200px|right|John Lennon (right) playing Rickenbacker model 325 along with The Beatles on Ed Sullivan show]]

In [[Hamburg]] 1960, the then-unknown [[John Lennon]] bought a 325 Capri, which he used throughout the early days of The Beatles. Lennon eventually had the guitar, which originally sported a natural body finish, refurbished in a black finish, officially known as 'Jetglo' by Rickenbacker, and went on to use this guitar during The Beatles famous 1964 debut appearance on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]].

A second 325 model was given to Lennon while in Miami on the same visit to the US. He used this newer model on The Beatles' next appearance on The Ed Sullivan show. Confusingly, a third airing of the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show featured the formerly mentioned 325 model because the show was pre-recorded during the afternoon of the first show.

Lennon accidentally dropped the second 325 'Miami' model during a 1964 Christmas show, making the instrument go hopelessly out of tune every time he played it. While it was being fixed, Rose Morris, the British importer of Rickenbacker, gave Lennon an export version of the 325 called the 1996. This guitar was later given to [[Ringo Starr]].

In 1963, [[George Harrison]] of The Beatles bought a 425. In February of 1964, while in New York City, F.C. Hall of Rickenbacker gave as a gift to Harrison, the second model 360/12 (a 12-string guitar) ever made.  This instrument became a key part of the Beatles' sound on ''[[A Hard Day's Night (album)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (album)|Help!]]'' and was used by Harrison throughout his life. 

In August of 1965, Harrison was presented with a second model 360/12 "New Style" 12-string guitar, which he toured with until it was stolen in 1969.

Though difficult to fret cleanly (the 12 strings are on a conventional width six string neck) the guitar remains very popular because it is still the only way to get the true "12 string Rick" sound, one of rock music's most distinctive sounds since 1964. 

After 1966, when the Beatles ceased touring, Paul McCartney made use of a Rickenbacker bass model (see below), since its tone was better suited to recording than the lightweight Hofner bass he had used for live performances. The instrument became popular with other bassists influenced by his highly melodic style, as it produces a clear tone even when played high up the neck, its deep cutaways allowing easy access to the higher frets. McCartney has predominantly used a Rickenbacker bass in the studio ever since.

Perhaps at least partially due to the Beatles persistant use of the brand, Rickenbackers were quickly adopted by many other 1960s notables, including [[Roger McGuinn]] of [[The Byrds]], [[Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]], [[Carl Wilson]] of the [[Beach Boys]],  [[Paul Kantner]] of [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]]

As the British invasion and the 1960s came to an end, Rickenbacker guitars fell somewhat out of fashion by the early '70s, though Rickenbacker basses remained in favor. 

The guitars experienced a renaissance in the late 1970s and '80s as many [[New Wave music|New Wave]] and [[jangle pop]] groups began to use them. They continue to be popular to this day, especially with groups influenced by the 1960s sound.  

Later "Ric" players include [[Tom Petty]] and [[Mike Campbell]] of [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[James Honeyman-Scott]] of [[the Pretenders]], [[The Edge]] of [[U2]], [[Paul Weller]] of [[The Jam]], [[Peter Buck]] of [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]], [[Robin Zander]] of [[Cheap Trick]], [[Johnny Marr]] of [[The Smiths]], Wally Palmar, Mike Skill, and Coz Canler of [[The Romantics]], [[Dave Wakeling]] of [[the English Beat]], [[Paul Westerberg]] of [[the Replacements]], [[Susanna Hoffs]] of [[The Bangles]], [[Tom Gabel]] of [[Against Me!]], [[Lloyd Cole]], [[Dave Gregory]] of [[XTC]], [[Guy Picciotto]] of [[Fugazi (band)|Fugazi]], [[Thom Yorke]] of [[Radiohead]], [[Ed O'Brien]] of [[Radiohead]], [[Courtney Love]] (during the earlier days of [[Hole (band)|Hole]]), [[Kat Bjelland]] ([[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes in Toyland]] and Katastrophy Wife), [[Pete Doherty]] and [[Carl Barat]] of [[The Libertines]], [[John Kay]] of [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], [[Marty Willson-Piper]] of [[The Church]], [[Daniel Johns]] of [[Silverchair]], [[Daniel Kessler]] of [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]], [[Sherri DuPree]] of [[Eisley]], [[Paul Waaktaar-Savoy]] of [[a-Ha]], [[Kurt Ballou]] of [[Converge (band)|Converge]], Jim Cuddy of [[Blue Rodeo]], [[Elliott Smith]], [[Tim Rogers]] of [[You Am I]], [[Kevin Mitchell]] of [[Jebediah]], Luke Steele of [[The Sleepy Jackson]], [[Andrew Deighton]] of burnley college, [[Kenny Howes]] of Hautewerk, [[John Squire]] of the [[Stone Roses]], Tom Gabel of [[Against Me!]], [[Andy Bell]] and [[Mark Gardener]] of [[Ride]], [[Toshiya]] of [[Dir en grey]], [[Lemmy Kilmister]] of [[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]] and [[Shiina Ringo]] who makes slight mention of the Rickenbacker 620 in her song "Marunouchi Sadistic".

== Hallmarks of Rickenbackers == 

[[Image:howe.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Steve Howe (guitarist)|Steve Howe]] playing a Rickenbacker guitar with the progressive rock band [[Yes (band)|Yes]] in 1977]] 

Many Rickenbackers <U+2014> both guitars and basses <U+2014> are equipped to be compatible with a "Rick-O-Sound" unit via an extra "[[stereophonic sound|stereo]]" output socket, that allows the two pickups (or neck and middle pickup combined/bridge pickup, in the case of three pickup instruments) to be connected to different effects units or amplifiers. Another idiosyncrasy of Rickenbackers is the use of two truss rods (rather than the usual one) to correct twists, as well as curvature, in the neck. 



Rickenbacker guitars are noted for their distinctive jangle and chime.  They are very trebly instruments and, unlike most electric guitars used in rock and roll, are often played cleanly, without distortion.  Because of their tone, the guitars are favored by [[jangle pop]], [[power pop]], and [[British Invasion]]-style groups.  Though there are exceptions, most hard rock, metal, and punk outfits eschew Rickenbacker guitars because they are not as well suited to tougher, grittier sounds as are other guitars; Rickenbacker basses, however, are a staple of the hard rock genre (see below).

== Basses ==
The 4000 series were the first Rickenbacker bass guitars, production beginning in 1954. The 4000 was followed by the very popular 4001 (in 1961), the 4002 (limited edition bass introduced in 1977, only 100 or so models were produced), the 4008 (an 8-string model introduced in the mid-'70s), the 4003 (in about 1980 and still in production in 2006), and most recently the 4004 series. There was also the 4005 which was a hollow-bodied bass guitar (discontinued in the 80's); it did not resemble any of the other 4000 series basses, but rather the new style 360-370 guitars.

Rickenbacker basses have a distinctive tone. The 4000 bass has neck-through construction for more solid sustain due to more rigidity. The 3000 series made from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s were cheaper instruments with bolt-on necks.

Three of the earliest Rickenbacker bass users were The Beatles' [[Paul McCartney]], [[Peter Quaife]] of [[The Kinks]], who played for one of the most popular and acclaimed [[British Invasion]] groups; and [[Roger Waters]] of [[Pink Floyd]], who played a 4001S in the band's psychedelic early days before permanently switching to the [[Fender Precision Bass]], with which he is most closely identified. 

[[Image:Rogerwatersric.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An early picture of [[Roger Waters]] playing his Ric 4001]]

The basses were a staple of [[1970s]] [[hard rock]] and made a major contribution to the genre. Paul McCartney with [[Wings]], [[Chris Squire]] from [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Michael Rutherford]] from [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Geddy Lee]] from [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Lemmy Kilmister]] from [[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]], [[Graham Gouldman]] from [[10cc]], Steve Smith of [[the Vapors]], [[Rick James]], and [[Roger Glover]] from [[Deep Purple]] comprise just a sampling of Rickenbacker bass players in the idiom. The basses were also popular with later hard rock and metal purveyors, most notably the late [[Cliff Burton]] of [[Metallica]], a dedicated Rickenbacker player.

The basses were not as visible among the punk/new wave explosion of the late 1970s and early 1980s, though there were three notable users.  [[Glen Matlock]] of the [[Sex Pistols]] played a Rickenbacker during his tenure with the band. [[Peter Hook]] of [[Joy Division]] and [[New Order]] used a red 4001 to create his distinctive sound. [[Bruce Foxton]] of [[The Jam]] played a Rickenbacker 4001 through the group's first two albums (both released in [[1977]]), in part because the band strived to emulate the "mod" look and sound of the 1960s and the Rickenbacker label had the ultimate mod pedigree thanks to [[Pete Townshend]]'s use of Rickenbacker guitars.  Foxton would later switch to a [[Fender Precision Bass]].  ([[The Jam]]'s guitarist, [[Paul Weller]], played Rickenbacker guitars throughout the group's existence.)  [[Paul Simonon]] of [[The Clash]] used a black Rickenbacker that he received as a gift from [[Patti Smith]], but later would switch to a Precision Bass[http://www.bassplayer.com/story.asp?sectioncode=21&storycode=3974]. Former [[The Stone Roses|Stone Roses]] bassist [[Gary Mounfield|Gary "Mani" Mounfield]] used a Rickenbacker 4005 bass covered in [[Jackson Pollock]]-style drip paint during the band's peak period (1989<U+2013>90). [[John Taylor]] of [[Duran Duran]] occasionally used a Rickenbacker. [[Jerry Only]] played an SB4001 in the early days of [[The Misfits]], before switching to Rand (and later Gothic Customs) Annihilator basses. 

In recent times, many bass players continue to play Rickenbackers, including [[Bob Hardy]] of [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], Mike H. of [[the Bravery]], John McCourt of [[ist]], Dean Turner of [[Magic Dirt]], [[Janet English]] of [[Spiderbait]] and Chris Ross of [[Wolfmother]]. [[Rishi Dhir]] of [[the High Dials]], [[Chris Joannou]] of [[Silverchair]], [[Guy Berryman]] of [[Coldplay]], [[Nikolai Fraiture]] of [[the Strokes]], [[Dr. Matt Destruction]] of [[The Hives]], [[Mark Stoermer]] of [[The Killers (band)|the Killers]], [[Les Claypool]] of [[Primus (band)|Primus]],[[Scott Reeder]] of [[Kyuss |Kyuss]], [[Chris Wolstenholme]] of [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[Dave Dreiwitz]] of [[Ween]] and [[Tim Commerford]], previously of [[Rage Against the Machine]] and currently with [[Audioslave]], have also been spotted using Rickenbackers. [[Steve DiGiorgio]] of [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Sadus]] and [[Dark Hall]] used two custom Rickenbackers prior to his ESP endorsement.

[[Fiction|Fictional]] character [[Haruhara Haruko]] from [[FLCL]] uses a left-handed, blue Rickenbacker bass with a pull cord (like on a [[lawnmower]]) not as a musical instrument, but as her [[weapon]].

==Pickups==

Current Rickenbacker models (guitars and basses alike) come with three distinctive types of pickups. Most models come with "Hi-Gains"<sup>TM</sup> as the standard, which are meant to be suitable for use with distortion. Others, like the 650 model series utilize a special Rickenbacker humbucking pickup that sound more like traditional single coil pickups.

Vintage models, and some signature models, come with "toasters", commonly referred to as "Toaster-Top"<sup>TM</sup> pickups, which literally resemble a classic silver two-slotted toaster. Utilized in the past by The Beatles and other British invasion bands, these pickups, although less suitable for use with distortion then hi-gain pickups, produce a brighter, cleaner sound, and are generally seen as key to obtaining the true British invasion guitar sound.

Additionally, some vintage and reissue bass models are equipped with "Horseshoe"<sup>TM</sup> wrap-around style pickups, very similar to the earliest Rickenbacker Frying Pan models.

==Notable models==

Some of Rickenbacker's most popular models include the following:

[[Image:Thom_yorke_radiohead2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thom Yorke]] of [[Radiohead]] playing a Rickenbacker guitar]]

* 325 - Six-string, short scale guitar used by [[John Lennon]]. Less than 400 were built between 1958 and 1970. The 325 has a hollow body, though not all have a sound hole (Most notably, [[John Lennon]]'s)[http://www.minidrums.com/honey/electric/ricks/325black/hamburg_rick.jpg]
* 330 - Six-string hollow body with scimitar shaped sound-hole - used by Luke Steele from [[The Sleepy Jackson]]
[http://www.rickbeat.com/modelslibrary/330/330_front.jpg]
* 360 - A deluxe version of the 330, with stereo output and bound fretboard with triangle inlays. Earlier models have a 330 body shape, with top and bottom binding (known as "OS" (Old Style) or "WB" (With Binding)), later models with more rounded body top and horns, and no top binding. [http://www.rockinn.co.jp/maniac/rickenbacker/images/ric_360.jpg]
* 360/12 - A twelve-string version of the 360. Rickenbacker touts this model as "The world's most popular twelve string electric guitar". Made famous in the '60s by [[George Harrison]] [http://thebeatlescr.com/imagenes/hari/049.jpg] (see 360/12C63 below for exact Harrison replica), [[Brian Jones]] of [[the Rolling Stones]]  
* 370/12 - The same as the 360/12, but with a third pickup.  This is the Rickenbacker model used by [[Roger McGuinn]], arguably the most renowned 12-string player of all-time. [http://www.mlode.com/~813/mcguinn70_onstage.jpg]
* 370/12RM - A limited edition Roger McGuinn signature model from the early 1990's. This model  accurately reflected the appointments of McGuinn's 370 from his years with the Byrds, and came with an optional internal compressor to recreate the "jangle sound" of the guitar achieved on the Byrd's recordings by using extreme external compression. 
* 620, 620/12 & 660/12 - Used by [[Tom Petty]] and [[Mike Campbell]] of [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]][http://www.guitars.net/star36.gif]
* Rose, Morris 1996 - British export version of 325, distributed by Rose, Morris in the UK. Touted as the Beatle-Backer by RM. Almost all were made in the popular Fireglo sunburst. RM1996s are hard to distinguish from the American counterparts because both varieties had ''f''-shaped sound holes- the domestic version kept this un-Lennonesque feature until the eighties.
* Rose, Morris 1993 - British export version of 360/12, distributed by Rose, Morris in the UK during the mid 1960s. Basically a bound 330 with an f hole instead of a slash sound hole. [[Pete Townshend]]) [http://www.whocollection.com/RickenbackerPromo.JPG]
* 4001 - Possibly Rickenbacker's most popular bass guitar.  Famous players include [[Cliff Burton]] ([[Metallica]]), [[Lemmy Kilmister|Ian "Lemmy" Kilmister]] ([[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]]), [[Geddy Lee]] ([[Rush (band)|Rush]]), [[Paul McCartney]] ([[The Beatles]]/[[Paul McCartney and Wings|Wings]]/solo), and [[Chris Squire]] ([[Yes (band)|Yes]]).
* 4003 - Updated version of the 4001. 

=== Discontinued models ===
* 230 Hamburg - Six string solid body electric. These guitars adopted the body style of the 430. They had special design RIC single coil pickups, and later RIC humbuckers. The single coils used a battery-less active circuitry. These guitars were in production from 1984 until the early 90's. 
* 250 El Dorado - Deluxe version of the 230, featuring a bound body. Equipped with RIC humbuckers. 
* 260 - Deluxe version of the 230, including maple fingerboard, bound body, and single-ply pickguard. Equipped with RIC humbuckers. 
* 341 - The Rickenbacker Light Show Guitars, were made in the early 1970's, and used an external [[Light Organ]] controller [[dimmer]] system to drive multi coulored lights underneath a translucent [[lucite]] face plate. These Guitars were very heavy, and became extremely hot while being used with the lights on. 
* 425 - Six string solid body electric, as played briefly by George Harrison in 1963 - it was used on "Ready, Steady Go!". These guitars were among Rickenbacker's less expensive, and featured the "cresting wave" body shape along with a massive pickguard, neck-through body construction, Combination bridge/tailpiece and one toaster (and later, a higain) pickup. In production from the early 60's to the late 70's.
* 430 - Six string solid body, designed in part with Forrest White, formerly of Fender. The Fender influence is obvious, as this guitar features a bolt on neck and a simplified, stripped down styling reminiscent of the Fender Telecaster. Later, the 200 series guitars would adopt the same body style. These guitars were introduced in the early 70's and dropped in the early 80's. 
* 450 - Two pickup version of the 425. 
* 460 - Deluxe version of the 450 (Bound body and triangle inlays). 
* 480 - Six-string solid body guitar with the body stylings of the 4000 series basses. These guitars had dot inlays, dual higain pickups, and a contoured body. Produced from 1973 to 1983. 
* 481 - Like the 480, except it had a bound body and triangle pearl inlays. The most striking feature, however, was the slanted frets/bridge/pickups/nut, supposedly "matching natural finger angle" and enabling easier playing. This guitar also had special design Rickenbacker humbucking pickups, which never appeared in another Rickenbacker instrument. Produced from 1973 to 1983.
* 4005 - This bass was introduced in 1965, and adapted the new-style 360 body in a hollowbody bass. Two toaster pickups, single-tier pickguard, 5th knob, bound f-hole, full-width pearl inlays, checkered binding on back. In production until 1983.
* 4005WB - This shared the same shape as the 4005, except it was double bound, and had a flat top. Comparable to an "old-style" 360, or a 360WB. Very few were made in comparison to the regular 4005. In production until 1983. 
* 4003s5 - Five-string bass recently discontinued. Shared the body style of the 4003s. 
* 4003s8 - Eight-string bass recently discontinued. Shared the body style of the 4003s.
* 4003 SPC Blackstar - Limited Edition bass for Smithereens bassist Mike Mesaros. Featured an all black body and painted maple fretboard with white microdot inlays, and black hardware. Production was limited to 200 basses.
* 4003 SPC Tuxedo - Limited Edition bass, featured all white body with painted maple neck, black microdot inlays, and black hardware. Production was approx 120 instruments constructed in two runs. The Tuxedo was also produced as a guitar; the 360 series included both 6 and 12 string models.
* 4003 SPC Redneck - Limited Edition bass, featured all red body with painted maple neck, black microdot inlays, and black hardware. Production was approx 38 instruments, 11 of which are thought to be 8 string models.
* 4003 Shadow - Limited Edition bass, featured all black body, checkerboard binding, and  black dot "S" type neck with binding, and black hardware. The Shadow was produced for Guitar Center's 50th store opening, production limited to 50 instruments.
* 4001CS Limited Edition bass for Yes bassist Chris Squire. Featured a creme finish, walnut headstock wings, square heel, and vintage type pickups, and a signature pickguard. Very similar to the 4003V63 model, production was limited to 1000 basses.
* 4001V63 Reproduction of the export RM1999 that were made famous by the Kinks, Roger Wates, Chris Squire and Sir Paul. Model specs were almost identical to the 4001 CS.

=== Current Reissue Models ===
* 325c58 - A reissue of the guitar John Lennon originally bought in Hamburg in 1960, and eventually used on The Beatles' first Ed Sullivan Show appearance. This guitar is available in both Mapleglo (how Lennon originally got it, and though the body is actually alder), and Jetglo (as it appeared on the Ed Sullivan show). Short scale body, Kauffman vib-rola tailpiece, oven knobs, three toaster pickups, gold plastic parts. 
* 325c64 - F.C. Hall presented John with a new 325 to replace his road weary one during the group's first trip to New York. John used the new guitar on The Beatles second Sullivan show appearance and on the group's subsequent tours and albums. This guitar has an Ac'cent Vibrato and white plastic parts.
* 1996 - New for 2006, the 1996 is a reissue of the guitar played briefly by John Lennon in late 1964 - known in Rickenbacker advertising of the period as "The Beatle Backer". It is similar to the 325 except for the F-hole, which came standard on all Rose Morris hollow body instruments. This instrument is available in Amber Fireglo only, RIC's 2006 Color of the Year. [[John Lennon]] received this model after damaging his second 325. [http://www.stthomasu.ca/~pmccorm/research/lennon1996.jpg]
* 360/12C63 - While the 360/12, like most of Rickenbacker's guitars, has been subtly updated throughout the years, the 360/12C63 is designed to be a 'frozen in time' replica of the famous 1963 guitar that George Harrison used during the 'A Hard Day's Night' period. This guitar replaced the 360/12v64. [http://www.pittsburghguitars.com/Resources/36012c.jpg]
* 4001c64 - An accurate replica of the Fireglo 4001s bass Paul McCartney received from Rickenbacker in 1965, and subsequently began using on "Rubber Soul". Paul's was a lefty with a right-handed neck; the current issue of the bass comes in right-handed with a left-handed neck, and left-handed with a right-handed neck. This bass replaced the 4001v63. 
* 4001c64s - Designed as a replica of Sir Paul's bass in its current state: The upper horn has been sanded down, the paint has been stripped to the bare maple, and there is a zero fret.
