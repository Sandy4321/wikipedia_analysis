'''''Mercury Rising''''' is a [[1998 in film|1998]] action thriller [[feature film]], starring [[Bruce Willis]] and [[Alec Baldwin]]. [[Film director|Directed]] by [[Harold Becker]], the movie is based on [[Ryne Douglas Pearson]]'s [[1996]] novel; originally published as ''[[Simple Simon (book)|Simple Simon]]''. Bruce Willis plays Art Jeffries, an [[undercover]] [[FBI]] agent who protects a nine-year-old [[autism|autistic]] boy who is the target for [[Assassination|assassins]] after cracking a [[top secret]] government code. 

==Plot==
A cryptographic [[Code (cryptography)|code]] called "Mercury" was created by The [[National Security Agency]], so complex that its creators believe no computer on earth can decipher it. Originally created during the [[Reagan Administration]] as a test to keep the United States' highest priority secrets under wraps, their assumption is revealed to be false when they receive a message from an [[autistic savant]] boy named Simon Lynch ([[Miko Hughes]]) who calls a telephone number written in the code, which was secretly published in a puzzle magazine by two of the creators to see if anyone could break it. Colonel Kudrow ([[Alec Baldwin]]) seeks to silence Simon. Kudrow sends a [[hit man]] to murder Simon and his family. 

After killing the boy's parents, the assassin searches the house, fails to find Simon, and leaves at the sound of approaching sirens. Art Jeffries ([[Bruce Willis]]) is an undercover FBI agent who protects Simon. He finds Simon hiding in a cache of his bedroom closet and takes the boy under his wing. Jeffries begins to realize the difficulty of protecting, let alone questioning Simon, because of his impaired social abilities as a result of his autism. The situation is further complicated by the fact that nobody at the FBI believes Simon is in any danger. Meanwhile, Colonel Kudrow, upset by disagreement over how to handle the case, murders one of his employees. The murdered employee's friend turns to Jeffries for help, and together they set a trap in which Kudrow is killed. The film ends with Simon being adopted by a new family.
