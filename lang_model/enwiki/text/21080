The '''Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de la Guadalupe Cathedral''' (or simply the '''Ponce Cathedral''') is the [[cathedral]] for the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ponce]] located in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], [[Puerto Rico]]. The cathedral lies in the middle of Ponce [[town square]], known as [[Plaza Las Delicias]], right behind the [[Parque de Bombas]].

==History==
In 1670, a small [[chapel]] was built in the center of the colonial settlement of Ponce.<ref>[http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1986/2/86.02.01.x.html#h '''Spain in Puerto Rico: Early Settlements.''' By Doris Vazquez.

During the 18th century, the church was damaged by several [[earthquake]]s. One was particularly devastating. In 1918 as a consequence of the [[1918 Puerto Rico Earthquake|earthquake that affected the island that year]], the structure was severely damaged. Among them, the loss of both of its original towers.<ref>[http://www.travelponce.com/Ponce-Cathedral.html ''Ponce Cathedral'' at TravelPonce website]</ref> Despite this, in 1924, [[Pope Pius XI]] declared the church a [[cathedral]]. Its first [[bishop]] was [[Edwin Byrne]] who took charge in 1925.<ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dponc.html  Catholic Diocesis of Ponce. ''Past and Present Ordinaries.'']</ref>

From 1931-37,<ref>[http://www.anadon.biz/ponce/ponce.shtml Cathedral de Ponce. Ponce: La Capital del Sur de Puerto Rico. By Marco A.

==Significance==

The Cathedral Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de Guadalupe of Ponce is one of only five cathedrals in Puerto Rico. It stands out among the others for its history and intricate design, which consists of multiple domes as well as many interior vaults.

In 1835, the original church at the site currently occupied by the Cathedral was demolished to build an entirely new structure. The new building opned in 1839.  That structure was smaller than the current structure in two major ways. First, it did not include the southern chapel.  This was addd more than 60 years later, in 1911. It also did not include the current majestic front towers. The original towers were destroyed by the [[1918 Puerto Rico earthquake]]. The current towers were built between 1931 and 1937.<ref>Marissa Gomez and Ester Cardona, Architects (Investigaciones Bonaire, Inc.).

==Physical appearance==

===Surroundings===
The Cathedral sits on [[Plaza Las Delicias]], oriented east-to-west, with its front entrance facing west. Together with [[Parque de Bombas]], the Cathedral effectively divides Plaza Las Delicias into two smaller plazas, named Plaza Munoz Rivera and Plaza Degetau. Low, yet graceful, walls on the Cathedral northern and southern sides actually separate it from its more mundane surroundings.

===Interior plan===
[[File:IMG 3136 - Ponce Cathedral pipe organ in Ponce, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The pipe organ at the Catedral de Nuestra Senora de la Guadalupe (Ponce Cathedral) in Ponce, Puerto Rico]]

The footprint of the Cathedral is of a [[cruciform]] plan. It is accentuated by a large dome at its intersept. The interior consists of eight bays plus the [[apse]].  The westernmost bay accomodates the [[vestibule]]. A wooden stairway attached to the front wall leads to the second level choir loft. A large pipe organ, said to have been played by Juan Morel Campos on every Sunday for many years, is also on the second level. 

A series of arcades divide the main nave from the side aisles. On the south side of the cathedral, the larger chapel built in 1911 extends three bays parallel to the side aisle. This chapel provides a more intimate place of worship than the main church or its aisles The altar is of [[neoclassic]] design.  It is a more modern structure than the rest.  The cathedral floor is of gray and white marble design. Terrazzo is used, however, in the side chapel. <ref name="Ester Cardona 1984.

===The front facade===
The architecture is the church is [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]]. The Cathedral has two square towers that decorate its front facade. They are both three stories high topped with a silver dome and a Christian cross on top of these. There are wooden windows to each external side of the two towers at both the first and second levels. The third level has wooden windows on all four sides. Access to the towers is via doors in the interior corners of the church sanctuary.  The main entrance to the church is from the front.  Access is via two oversize wooden doors reminecent of door in [[Middle Ages]] Europe. There are two round columns to each side of these doors, as well as rectangular wooden windows to both sides.  Atop the second level of the front facade there is, above a large triangular pediment, a Christian cross considerably larger than the two atop the tower domes. There are also two sculptures of either [[saint]]s or [[disciple]]s, standing at each of the two lower ends of the large triangular pediment.
