'''"Amen"''' ([[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew script]]: '''<U+05D0><U+05DE><U+05DF>''') was the [[Israel]]i entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995]], performed in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] by [[Liora]].

The song is a prayer to [[God]] for protection, with the title being derived from the word [[Amen]], which is repeated frequently in the prayer.

The song was performed twenty-first on the night (following [[Slovenia]]'s [[Darja <U+0160>vajger]] with "[[Prisluhni mi]]" and preceding [[Malta]]'s [[Mike Spiteri]] with "[[Keep Me In Mind (Mike Spiteri song)|Keep Me In Mind]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 81 points, placing 8th in a field of 23. In the pre-selection show in Israel Liora performed the song with candles on the stage. The Irish production, however, declined the Israeli candles staging due to "safety problems". 

Due to the rapidly expanding size of the Contest, entry to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996 Contest]] was determined through an internal preselection in which judges listened to recordings of the proposed entries. Israel did not progress through this stage. Entry to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997 Contest]] was restricted to those countries with the best average scores over the previous five years, a group which did not include Israel. The country did, however, participate as a "passive participant", by screening the Contest live. This earned Israel the right to re-enter the Contest in 1998. Hence, the song was succeeded as [[Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest|Israeli representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998 Contest]] by [[Dana International]] with "[[Diva (song)|Diva]]".
