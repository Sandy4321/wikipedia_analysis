'''York Park''', presently known as '''Aurora Stadium''' under a naming-rights sponsorship deal, is an [[Australian rules football]] ground located in [[Inveresk, Tasmania|Inveresk]], an inner city suburb of [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], [[Tasmania]], [[Australia]]. It's the largest capacity stadium in Tasmania.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} 

It was originally the home of the [[North Launceston Football Club]].  Since 1999 it has undergone a series of redevelopments as part of the bid to get [[Australian Football League]] games to Tasmania.  The upgrades have included additional seating and grandstands, as well as lights for night games.  It currently has a capacity of around 20,000, due to a fire in March 2008 destroying part of the Northern Stand and therefore reducing its capacity.<ref name="firemar08">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/03/31/2203444.htm|title=Arson suspected in historic grandstand fire|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=2008-03-31|accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref>

In [[September 2004]], [[Aurora Energy]] secured the naming rights to the stadium for the next six years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.austadiums.com/news/news.php?id=97|title=New name for York Park|date=2004-09-28|accessdate=2008-06-13|publisher=Austadiums.com}}</ref>  The precinct around the stadium will still be called York Park, but the stadium itself will be referred to as ''Aurora Stadium'' until [[2010]].

==History==
The area now known as York Park was originally swampland.  It was converted into a sports field in the early 1920s.  Since 1923 the ground has hosted first-class Australian rules football.  Other sports played in the park precinct in the years since establishment have included cricket, tennis, bowling, cycling and foot-racing.  It was formally opened on [[January 1]] [[1921]], and named in honour of the Duke of York (later to become [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]), who visited Tasmania during the [[Federation of Australia|Federation celebrations of 1901]].<ref name="historysep06">{{cite news|url=http://www.examiner.com.au/story.asp?id=359597|title=The making of Tassie's biggest sports icon|publisher=[[The Examiner (Tasmania)|The Examiner]]|date=2006-09-03|accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref>

As late as [[1998]], York Park remained a suburban sports ground, where, according to ground manager [[Robert Groenewegen]], supporters were able to "''park [their] car next to the boundary fence''".<ref name="historysep06" />

Before the [[Australian federal election, 1998|1998 federal election]], [[Division of Bass|Bass]] MP [[Warwick Smith (politician)|Warwick Smith]] made a re-election promise to fund the re-development of York Park.  Although Smith failed to win his seat, the promise was upheld by the federal [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal government]].<ref name="historysep06" />  Completed in 2000, this was the first major development to bring the ground up to AFL standards.  This included the Gunns Stand - a two-level grandstand with corporate facilities, at a cost of $12.5&nbsp;million,<ref name="2008expansion" /> as well as five light towers for television standard lighting levels.<ref name="austadiums">{{cite web|url=http://www.austadiums.com/stadiums/stadiums.php?id=141|title=Austadiums.com - Aurora Stadium|accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref><ref name="officialmap">{{cite web|url=http://www.aurorastadiumlaunceston.com.au/yorkpark.html|title=Aurora Stadium - Map|accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref>

In 2003, it was announced that the Government would spend $2&nbsp;million in roofing for an additional 6,000 seats, resulting in almost the entire seated capacity of the ground being protected from weather.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2003/04/07/826044.htm|title=Council welcomes York Park seating boost|date=2003-04-07|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref>

In 2006 the Tasmanian Government supplied $150,000 for new gates and ticket boxes at the entry to the stadium.  It was announced the gates would be named after recently deceased Premier [[Jim Bacon]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2006/08/18/1718360.htm|title=York Park gates to be named after Bacon|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=2006-08-16|accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref>

In March 2008, a deliberately lit fire destroyed part of the heritage-listed Northern Stand.  Damage was estimated at A$500,000.<ref name="firemar08" />  The insurance payout from the fire may be used to determine whether the venue is expanded.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/mercury/story/0,22884,23802219-13222,00.html|title=Bigger Aurora Stadium planned|publisher=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]|date=2008-06-03|accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref>

Ground manager Robert Groenewegen has suggested that the capacity could be increased to around 24,000 by replacing the old Northern Stand, at an estimated cost of $10&nbsp;million.<ref name="2008expansion">{{cite news|url=http://northerntasmania.yourguide.com.au/news/local/politics/no-takers-on-10m-stadium-expansion-plan/1244873.html|title=No takers on $10m stadium expansion plan|publisher=[[The Examiner (Tasmania)|The Examiner]]|date=2008-06-03|accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref>

==Stadium facilities==

The stands and facilities at the stadium include:<ref name="officialmap" />

*The ''Gunns Stand'' (named after timber company [[Gunns|Gunns Limited]]) in the south west of the oval.  It cost $12.5&nbsp;million to build and has a capacity of 6,000.<ref name="2008expansion" />  It has two tiers of seating and several corporate box areas, ''Gunns Function Centre'' and ''Corporate Function Centre''.<ref name="functioncentres">{{cite web|url=http://www.aurorastadiumlaunceston.com.au/content/view/17/31/|title=Aurora Stadium - Event Hospitality|accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref>

*The ''Aurora Function Centre'' is a corporate area immediately north of the Gunns Stand.<ref name="functioncentres" />

*The ''Northern Terrace'', ''Southern Terrace'' and ''Eastern Terrace'' stands are covered stands which combined surround approximately half the oval.  The Northern and Southern terraces are positioned behind the goals at either end of the ground.

*The ''Northern Stand'', just to the west of the Northern Terrace, was partly destroyed by fire in March 2008.<ref name="firemar08" />

*The ''Railway Workers Hill'' is a small, uncovered stand located at the eastern side of the ground.  North Launceston Football Club was originally named Railway Football Club.

As of June 2008, the [[Government of Tasmania]] has spent a total of $14&nbsp;million on the venue.<ref name="2008expansion" />

[[Australian rules football]] is the primary sport played at the stadium. The ground is the long time home of [[North Launceston Football Club]] and as a result, hosts regular [[Northern Tasmanian Football League]] and [[Northern Tasmanian Football Association]] matches.

The stadium has hosted AFL games regularly since [[2001]], when the [[Government of Tasmania]] started paying interstate clubs to relocate their home games.  [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] played a season game in 2001, increasing to two games in 2002 and joined by [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] in 2003.  In 2004 it was estimated that each game cost the government between $300,000 and $500,000, but Premier [[Jim Bacon]] stated that the Government was getting a good return on its investment, with each game being worth between $1&nbsp;million and $1.5&nbsp;million to the Tasmanian economy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2004/06/10/1128808.htm|title=Tas footing big bill for York Park match|date=2004-06-10|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2003/09/24/952429.htm|title=York Park kicking goals for Tas economy|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=2003-09-24|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>

The number of matches played reached it's peak in 2006, when Hawthorn played three home games and a pre-season game, and St Kilda played two home games.  The games drew consistently good crowds, with the 2006 premiership games drawing an average of over 17,000 and a record crowd of 20,971 for the Hawthorn vs [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] match.<ref name="austadiums" />

2007 saw the beginning of a five-year, $15&nbsp;million sponsorship agreement between Hawthorn and the Government of Tasmania which saw the state government become the club's primary sponsor, and Hawthorn playing five matches a year (one pre-season and four premiership games) at Aurora Stadium.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Sport/Hawks-confirm-Tasmanian-deal/2006/09/01/1156817089662.html|title=Hawks confirm Tasmanian deal|date=2006-09-01|publisher=[[The Age]]|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/sport/columns/200609/s1732788.htm?afl|title=Lifeline to the big time|date=2006-09-04|accessdate=2008-06-10|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC (Australia)]]}}</ref>

Hawthorn president [[Jeff Kennett]] has expressed interest in seeing his club play higher profile clubs such as [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] at the stadium.<ref name="2008expansion" />

From 2001 until 2007, the ground also hosted [[Tasmanian Devils Football Club]] home games in the [[Victorian Football League]]. They  mostly now play their matches at Hobart's Bellerive Oval. Three VFL games are scheduled at Aurora Stadium in 2008 

Aurora Stadium was the location of the [[AFL siren controversy, 2006|2006 AFL siren controversy]], a bizarre incident which occurred at a [[St Kilda Saints]] versus [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle Dockers]] match in April 2006.  Fremantle was a point in front when the siren to end the game sounded during a stoppage for a ball-up, but the umpire in charge of the ball at the time did not hear the siren, and carried on play despite the reactions of the Fremantle players around him. According to the laws of the game, the game has not ended until the umpire acknowledges the siren by raising both hands in the air, and that ''the siren should be sounded by the timekeepers until the umpire acknowledges''.

What followed was a farcical situation where play continued for approximately six seconds, St. Kilda levelling the scores in that period, ''that'' score being cancelled when a St. Kilda player was felled after the ball was kicked, earning a free kick, off which a [[Laws of Australian football#Scoring|behind]] was scored, levelling the scores anyway. After a protest the AFL commission convened and overturned the result to award Fremantle the game, and in the process according to a number of local football identities over ruled the traditional power of the umpires on match day.

The sirens have since been replaced, with the old "quiet" sirens to be displayed at the [[Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery]] in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aurorastadiumlaunceston.com.au/content/view/25/40/|title=Aurora Stadium - Sirengate|accessdate=2008-06-13}}</ref>

The stadium has been host to one [[National Soccer League]] game and three [[A-League]] pre-season games.

The first national league match at the stadium occurred when [[Melbourne Knights]] and [[Perth Glory FC|Perth Glory]] played a [[National Soccer League 2001-02|2001-02 NSL season]] match in front of a crowd of over 5000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/NSL/20012002/Round20.html|title=NSL 2001-02, Round 20|publisher=Ozfootball.net|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>

In July 2006, the stadium hosted Tasmania's first A-League match when [[Melbourne Victory FC|Melbourne Victory]] and [[Adelaide United FC|Adelaide United]] played there in the pre-season competition..  The fixture was repeated in 2007 and 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.a-league.com.au/default.aspx?s=hal_newsdisplay&id=22066|title=Football spreads its reach|date=2008-05-02|publisher=[[A-League]] website|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>
