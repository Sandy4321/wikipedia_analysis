"'''Like Father, Like Clown'''" is the sixth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox network]] in the United States on October 24, 1991. In the episode, [[Krusty the Clown]] reveals to the Simpson family that he is of Jewish heritage, and that his father, [[Rabbi Hyman Krustofski]], disowned him for pursuing a career in comedy. Krusty is emotionally upset and Bart and Lisa decide to try to reunite Krusty with his long-estranged father.

"Like Father, Like Clown" was written by the duo of [[Jay Kogen]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]]. Krusty's religion had not been part of the original concept of the character, so Kogen and Wolodarsky decided to parody the 1927 film ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'' and establish that Krusty is Jewish. The episode was carefully researched and two rabbis, Lavi Meier and [[Harold M. Schulweis]], were credited as "special technical consultants". It was directed by [[Jeffrey Lynch]] and [[Brad Bird]]; as it was Lynch's first credit as a director,  Bird was assigned to help him. Comedian [[Jackie Mason]], who had once been an ordained rabbi, provided the voice of Rabbi Krustofski. The rabbi later became an infrequently recurring character voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]. Mason later returned to voice the character in "[[Today I Am a Clown]]" in [[The Simpsons (season 15)|the fifteenth season]] and "[[Once Upon a Time in Springfield]] in [[The Simpsons (season 21)|the twenty-first season]].

In its original broadcast, "Like Father, Like Clown" finished 34th in ratings with a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 12.7. Jackie Mason won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] in 1992 for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] for his performance as Rabbi Krustofski.

==Plot==
Although [[Krusty the Clown]] agrees to have dinner with the Simpson family as part of his repayment for [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]'s help in exonerating him in the episode "[[Krusty Gets Busted]]", Krusty keeps putting it off, much to Bart's disappointment. An upset Bart writes a letter to Krusty saying he is no longer his fan.  Krusty's secretary is so moved by the letter that she tells Krusty she will quit her job if he does not keep his promise to Bart. This persuades Krusty to have dinner at the Simpson house. Upon learning that Krusty is coming the Simpson house for dinner, Milhouse comes along, to which Bart reluctantly allows. When asked to say grace, Krusty recites a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Berakhah|blessing]]. Realizing that Krusty is [[Judaism|Jewish]], Lisa speaks of his heritage, making Krusty break down in tears. He tells the family his real name, Herschel Krustofski, and describes his upbringing in the Lower East Side of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]].

His father, [[Hyman Krustofski]], was a rabbi and strongly opposed young Herschel's wish to become a [[clown]]; he wanted the boy to go to ''[[yeshiva]]'' instead. Krusty did attend the school, where he said he made the other students laugh by doing funny impressions of his father. As a result, Krusty became a  [[slapstick]] comedian behind his father's back. One night, Krusty performed at a rabbi's convention and a rabbi squirted [[seltzer water|seltzer]] on him, washing off his clown makeup. Rabbi Krustofski, who was in the audience, was furious and disowned his son, and now it has been 25 years since they have seen or spoken to each other.

In the weeks following this admission, Krusty thinks about his father and becomes depressed, breaking down on live television. Bart and Lisa decide to help reunite father and son, but the rabbi still refuses to accept Krusty's career choice, explaining that Krusty "turned his back on his traditions on his faith and on me". They decide to try to out-smart the rabbi. Lisa does research and finds [[Judaic]] teachings that urge forgiveness, but Rabbi Krustofski has responses for each of them out of stubbornness. In a last-ditch effort, Bart convinces the rabbi to realize his stubborn ways with a quote from [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], a Jewish entertainer just like Krusty.  This quote finally convinces Rabbi Krustofski that entertainers have a place in Jewish heritage. A deeply depressed Krusty is glumly doing a live taping of his show, when Rabbi Krustofski appears. The two joyously hug and reconcile in front of the audience of children, with Rabbi Krustofski accepting a cream pie from Bart and throwing it in his son's face.

The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called the episode, "a magnificent show, with Jackie Mason wonderfully over the top as Krusty's long-lost pa, and Lois Penny-candy giving Krusty a good talking to about Bart."<ref name="bbc"/> Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' listed "Like Father, Like Clown" as one of the ten episodes of ''The Simpsons'' that shows the "comic and emotional scope of the show." They wrote, "Most Krusty the Klown episodes go heavy on celebrity cameos, while playing up the character's misanthropic greed.
