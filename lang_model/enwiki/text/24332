==Officiating career==
===Early years===
Hochuli began officiating [[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner]] football games as a law student to earn additional income,<ref name=CDO /> which was suggested by one of his former high school coaches.<ref name=Referee />  His interest in officiating carried over into [[baseball]], where he was a [[Little League Baseball]] [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] from 1970 to 1973.<ref name=AzHOF />  Progressing to the high school level in 1973, he focused on football, and officiated games in the Tucson area until 1985.<ref name=AzHOF />  In addition to high school officiating, he worked college football games for the [[Big Sky Conference]] and [[Pacific-10 Conference]] as a line judge during the 1980s.<ref name= AzHOF />

===NFL career===
====Rise to referee====
Hochuli was hired by the NFL in 1990 as a back judge<ref name="CDO" /> after applying to the league before the [[1989 NFL season]].<ref name=Referee />  His first game in the league was on [[August 11]], [[1990]] at [[Lambeau Field]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]].<ref name="Interview" />  During his first two years in the league, he was assigned to the officiating crew headed by referee Howard Roe.<ref name=LockerRoom>{{Citation| title = Practice, Practice, Practice | journal = NASO LockerRoom | volume = 3 | issue = 4| date = [[2002-04-15]] | url = http://www.naso.org/lockerroom/LockerRoom0402.html}}</ref>  To gain additional experience as a back judge and eventually a referee, he participated in the NFL's partnership with the [[World League of American Football]] (WLAF), a spring developmental league, in 1991 and 1992.<ref name=AzHOF />  Utilizing his experience in the WLAF, as well as the organization, precision, and analytical skills he learned while working under Roe's guidance, Hochuli desired to become a crew chief in the NFL.<ref name=Referee />  He was promoted to referee in 1992<ref name=CDO /> when longtime referee Stan Kemp was diagnosed with [[Lou Gehrig's Disease]] and forced to retire.<ref name=Referee />  Hochuli had worked a [[National Football League exhibition season|pre-season]] game that year in [[Tokyo, Japan]] as a back judge when he received a telephone call following the game from then-Senior Director of Officiating, [[Jerry Seeman]].<ref name=Referee /> Seeman asked Hochuli to work as referee for the first time when the [[Denver Broncos]] hosted the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in a pre-season game.<ref name="Interview" /><ref name=Referee /> 

Since becoming a referee, Hochuli headed the officiating crews for [[Super Bowl XXXII]]<ref name="Nod">{{cite news | title=Hochuli's top-rated crew gets nod | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs03/news/story?id=1722442 | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | date=[[2004-01-29]] | accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref> and [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]],<ref name="SB38">{{cite news | title=Hochuli to head Super Bowl officiating team | url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/super/2004-01-29-refs_x.htm | publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' | first=Jarrett | last=Bell | date=[[2004-01-29]] | accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref> and he was selected as an alternate for [[Super Bowl XXXI]],<ref name="SB31">{{cite news |title=Tough test: Belichick calls Favre Elwayesque |url=http://www2.jsonline.com/packer/arc/13097/opp/patn123.html |last=Manoyan |first=Dan |publisher=''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' |date=[[1997-01-23]] |accessdate=2007-10-17}}</ref> [[Super Bowl XXXVII]],<ref name="Nod" /> and [[Super Bowl XXXIX]].<ref name="SB39">{{cite news |title=E.

====Officials' strike====
Hochuli has also served as the head of the NFL Referees Association, the union which represents NFL game officials.<ref name=Fulltime>{{cite news |title=Refereeing can often be full-time job |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/columns/clayton_john/1248329.html |last=Clayton |first=John |authorlink=John Clayton (sportscaster) |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |date=[[2001-09-05]] |accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref>  The union was responsible for negotiating a new contract for the officials prior to the [[2001 NFL season]].<ref name=nonews>{{cite news |title=No news good news for NFL |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/0831/1246562.html |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=[[2001-08-31]]| accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref>  At the time, salaries ranged from a first-year official earning [[US$]]1,431 a game to a veteran official with twenty years of experience making $4,330 a game.<ref name=NYTlockout>{{cite news |title=N.F.L.

At the start of the season, officials had rejected a league offer of a sixty percent immediate increase in salary, followed by an eighty-five percent salary increase in 2002, and a one-hundred percent increase in 2003.<ref name=rejection>{{cite web |title=N.F.L.

====Memorable games====
[[Image:Favre Hochuli.jpg|thumb|200px|Ed Hochuli (right) congratulating [[Green Bay Packers]] [[quarterback]] [[Brett Favre]] on his NFL pass completions record.]]
Hochuli has worked memorable games throughout his career.  In his second year as referee, he worked the 1993 [[Thanksgiving]] Day game between the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Miami Dolphins]] in [[Irving, Texas]].<ref name=Referee /> During the final moments of the game, Miami [[placekicker]] [[Pete Stoyanovich]] had a [[field goal (football)|field goal]] attempt blocked.<ref name=Referee /> The Cowboys' [[Leon Lett]] inadvertently touched the loose ball before the Dolphins' [[Jeff Dellenbach]] pounced on it.<ref name=Referee />  At the time, Hochuli had "no idea" what happened during the play and had to confer with three other officials to piece together the sequence of events.<ref name=Interview />  With the information gathered from the officials, he ruled that Miami retained possession of the football.<ref name=Interview />

On [[October 2]], [[2005]], he officiated the first regular season NFL game played outside the United States when the [[Arizona Cardinals]] played the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in [[Mexico City, Mexico]]<ref name=Referee1205>{{Citation |title = Se<U+00F1>or Hochuli Habla Espa<U+00F1>ol |magazine = Referee |year = 2005 |date= December 2005}}</ref> as part of the league's "[[F<U+00FA>tbol Americano]]" marketing campaign.  On the first penalty announcement of the game, Hochuli gave the explanation in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to pay respect to the host city and country.<ref name=Referee1205 />

He was the referee for the game between the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[Green Bay Packers]], played [[December 17]], [[2006]], that included Green Bay [[quarterback]] [[Brett Favre]] becoming the all-time leader for pass completions among quarterbacks in the NFL.<ref name=completions>{{cite news |title=Favre sets completions record in victory over Lions |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=261217009 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=[[2006-12-17]] |accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref>  Favre was unaware that his 4,968 pass completions were a record until he was informed during the game by Hochuli.<ref name=completions />  Hochuli was the referee again for another Favre record-breaking moment when Favre threw his 421st touchdown pass of his career on [[September 30]], [[2007]] at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] to break the record previously held by [[Dan Marino]].<ref name="PackersVikings">{{cite press release | title = Packers-Vikings Press Box Notes | publisher = [[Green Bay Packers]] | date = [[2007-09-30]] | url = http://www.packers.com/news/releases/2007/09/30/1/ | accessdate = 2007-10-17}}</ref><ref name=TDrecord>{{cite news |title=Favre sets record, leads Packers past Vikings |url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/recap?game_id=29249&displayPage=tab_recap&season=2007&week=REG4 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=[[2007-10-02]] |accessdate=2007-10-17}}</ref>

One of Hochuli's notable explanations came during a 2007 regular season game between the [[San Diego Chargers]] and [[New England Patriots]]. While nullifying a holding infraction, he announced through his [[microphone]], "There was no foul on the play. It was not a hold. The defender was just overpowered."<ref name=USAToday />

==Celebrity==
Hochuli's presence on the football field has created a [[cult]] following on the [[Internet]].<ref name=USAToday>{{cite news | title=For NFL officials, scrutiny begins long before kickoff | url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2007-10-09-officials_N.htm | first=Jeff | last=Zillgitt | publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' | date=[[2007-10-10]] |accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref> Websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as [[blog]]s have appeared in cyberspace.<ref name=USAToday />  While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it.  He said in a ''[[USA Today]]'' interview, "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee.  I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players.  Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee."<ref name=USAToday />  His recognition stems to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom.<ref name=CDO />  He has been approached by notable athletes such as former [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) player [[Charles Barkley]] at the airport.<ref name=NPR>{{cite episode | title = The Double Life of Ed Hochuli | url=http://www.kjzz.org/news/arizona/archives/200401/hochuli | series = National Public Radio | serieslink = National Public Radio | airdate = 2004-01-07}}</ref>   "It never ceases to amaze me," Hochuli told the ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]''. "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me."<ref name="CDO" />  He appreciates the notoriety, saying, "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of people and I enjoy that. Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people."<ref name=Referee />

Hochuli's career as an NFL official has been chronicled on the [[NFL Network]]'s ''Six Days to Sunday'' in 2005.<ref name=Sixdays>{{cite web |title=Six Days to Sunday with Ed Hochuli |url=http://switchboard.real.com/player/email.html?PV=6.0.12&&title=Six%20Days%20to%20Sunday%20with%20Ed%20Hochuli&link=http%3A%2F%2Fplay.rbn.com%2F%3Furl%3Dnfl%2Fnfl%2Fopen%2Fnflfilms%2Fdemand%2Fs2005%2F6days%2Fw12%2Fsix%5Fdays%5Fto%5Fsunday%5F300k.rm |publisher=[[NFL Network]] |format=[[RealPlayer]] |date=2005 |accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref>  The half-hour [[television program]] detailed the game preparations that Hochuli goes through from Monday to Saturday during the season.  This preparation work includes fifteen hours of video tape game review, a "couple hours" completing administrative tasks for the NFL, reading the [[rulebook]], taking a weekly written [[exam]] on [[Regulation of sport|rules]], and communicating with league supervisors.<ref name=Fulltime />

Hochuli's celebrity status off the field includes being mentioned on the [[Top 10 list]] during the [[January 29]], [[2002]] edition of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.<ref name="Top10">{{cite web | title=Top Ten Signs You've Been Watching Too Much Football | url=http://www.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/top_ten/index/php/20020129.phtml | publisher=[[CBS Broadcasting, Inc.]] | date=[[2002-01-29]] | accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref> His likeness appears in the ''[[Madden NFL]]'' [[video game]] franchise<ref name="Madden">{{cite web | title=The State of NFL Videogames | url=http://xbox.ign.com/articles/718/718947p1.html | first=Jonathan | last=Miller | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=[[2006-07-14]] | accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref> starting with ''[[Madden NFL 06]]''.<ref name="Madden06">{{cite web | title=Madden 360: A Closer Look | url=http://sports.ign.com/articles/661/661869p1.html | first=Jon | last=Robinson | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=[[2005-10-26]] | accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref>

==Physical exercise==
During his college football playing career, Hochuli labeled himself as "small" and "slow" and attempted to compensate for his stature with physical strength.<ref name=USAToday /> After college, he focused his efforts on [[running]] and has completed a total of thirteen [[marathon]]s.<ref name=USAToday /> As an official in the NFL, he gave up on long-distance running because it became too time consuming,<ref name="Workout" /> but he considers [[physical exercise]] part of the job and spends a "couple hours" a day conditioning his body.<ref name=Fulltime />  His workout routine consists of an hour of [[cardiovascular]] training (using a stair-climber or [[treadmill]]) each day and performing [[weight training]] four days a week.<ref name="Workout" />

His muscular upper body appearance has been noticed by NFL players.  [[Philadelphia Eagles]] quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] said, "You look at [Hochuli] and it looks like he needs to be on our side of the ball, or on defense."<ref name="Workout" />  [[Wide receiver]] [[Tim Dwight]] challenged Hochuli to a "measure off," to determine who had the bigger [[bicep]]s during a pre-season game prior to the [[2006 NFL season]].<ref name=CDO />  Between plays in a game, Hochuli is known to joke with the [[defensive linemen]], who in turn, joke with him about his physique.<ref name=USAToday />  When asked by a player to become a member of a particular team, Hochuli replies with, "I'd get hurt in the huddle."<ref name=USAToday />
