{{Campaignbox Spanish Civil War}}
The '''Spanish Civil War''', which lasted from [[July 17]], [[1936]] to [[April 1]], [[1939]], was a conflict in which the ''Francoists'' or ''Nationalists'', led by General [[Francisco Franco]], defeated the ''Republicans'' or ''Loyalists'' of the [[Second Spanish Republic]].
== The combatants == 
Republicans received weapons and volunteers from the [[Soviet Union]], [[Mexico]], the international [[Socialist]] movement, and the [[International Brigades]], while the Francoists received weapons and soldiers from [[Fascist Italy|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], logistical support from [[Portugal]], and support from  various Fascist organisations such as  [[The Blueshirts]] and [[Croix de Feu]].
The republicans ranged from centrists who supported a moderately capitalist [[liberal democracy]] to revolutionary [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchists]] and [[socialism|socialists]]; their power base was primarily secular and urban, but also included landless peasants, and it was particularly strong in industrial regions like [[Asturias]] and [[Catalonia]] {{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

The conservative, strongly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], along with [[Catalonia]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], sought autonomy or even independence from the central government of Madrid.  This option was left open by the Republican government. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

[[Image:GuerraCivil-Cruzada.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Violent attacks by groups of radical leftists on clergy, laity, and property of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] led the Nationalist side to call the Spanish Civil War a modern-day [[Crusade]].]]
The Nationalists on the contrary opposed these separatist movements. The Francoists (Nationalists) had a generally wealthier, more conservative base of  Catholic, monarchist, centralist, landowning and fascist interests, and they favoured the centralization of state power. Most [[Roman Catholic]] clergy supported the Nationalists. 

[[Atrocities]] were committed on both sides during the war. Some, including the use of [[Terrorism|terror tactics]] against civilians,  foreshadowed [[World War II]], as did some of the military [[tactics]].  [[Atrocities]] in the Republican side were committed by groups of radical leftists against the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] or by the [[NKVD|Stalinist NKVD]] (which also carried out murders of pro-Republican people, see [[Andreu Nin]]) against political enemies, on the Nationalist side these [[atrocities]] were ordered by the fascist authorities themselves in order to eradicate any trace of leftism in Spain. This included the [[Aerial bombing of cities#Inter war years .281919.E2.80.931938.29|aerial bombing of cities]], the execution of [[school teacher]]s (the efforts of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] to promote the laicism and to displace the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] from the education system were seen from the Nationalist side as an attack on the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]) or anyone who was accused of blasphemy or not going to Church on Sunday and the massive killings of civilians in the ''liberated cities''.<ref>Good examples of this kind of tactics in the Nationalist side can be found on the [[Bombing of Guernika]] or the Killing of Badajoz [http://www.sbhac.net/Republica/TextosIm/Badajoz/Badajoz.htm], [http://www.fortwayne.com/mld/journalgazette/16335140.htm].

While the war lasted only about three years, the political situation had already been violent for several years before. The number of casualties is disputed; estimates generally suggest that between 500,000 and 1 million people were killed. 

The war started with military uprisings throughout Spain and [[Spanish Empire|its colonies]].
Republican sympathizers, soldiers and civilians, formally acting independently of the state, massacred Catholic clergy and burned down churches, monasteries and convents and other symbols of the Spanish Catholic Church which Republicans (especially the anarchists and communists) viewed as an oppressive institution supportive of the old order. The Republicans also attacked nobility, former landowners, rich farmers and industrialists. 

During and after the war, the Nationalists carried out a program of mass-killing of opponents: unwanted individuals, including many non-combatants, were often jailed or, in many cases, killed by a firing squad. Trade-unionists, known Republican sympathisers and critics of Franco's regime were among the first to be targeted. The Nationalists also carried out aerial bombardment of civilian areas with strong assistance from the German and Italian air forces.  

The impact of the war was massive: the [[Economy of Spain|Spanish economy]] took decades to recover. The political and emotional repercussions of the war reverberated far beyond the boundaries of Spain and sparked passion among international intellectual and political communities, passions that still are present in Spanish politics today.

Republican sympathizers proclaimed it as a struggle between "[[tyranny]] and [[democracy]]", or "[[fascism]] and [[liberty]]", and many non-Spanish young, committed reformers and revolutionaries joined the [[International Brigades]], believing the Spanish Republic was the front line of the war against [[fascism]]. Franco's supporters, however, portrayed it as a battle between the "red hordes" of [[communism]] and [[anarchism]] on the one hand and "[[Christianity|Christian]] [[civilization]]" on the other. They also stated that they were [[protectionist|protecting]] the [[The Establishment|Establishment]] and  bringing security and direction to what they felt was an ungoverned and lawless society.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Prelude== 
[[Image:SalvadorDali-SoftConstructionWithBeans.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Foreshadowing the conflict: [[Salvador Dal<U+00ED>|'''Salvador Dal<U+00ED>'s''']] ''[[Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War)]]'']]

In the previous century Spain had undergone several civil wars, known as the [[Carlist Wars]]. The Spanish Civil War was considered by the [[Carlism|Carlists]] as yet another crusade against [[secularism]], though its scope and consequences were to be much greater.The end of the war was viewed with suspicion.


In the 1933 Spanish elections, the [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right]] (Confederaci<U+00F3>n Espa<U+00F1>ola de Derechas Aut<U+00F3>nomas) (CEDA) won the most seats in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]], but not enough to form a majority. President [[Niceto Alcal<U+00E1> Zamora]] refused to ask its leader, [[Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Gil-Robles]], to form a government, and instead invited [[Alejandro Lerroux]] of the [[Radical Republican Party]], a [[Centrism|centrist]] party despite its name, to do so. CEDA supported the Lerroux government; it later demanded and, on [[October 1]] [[1934]], received three ministerial positions. The Lerroux/CEDA government attempted to annul the social legislation that had been passed by the previous [[Manuel Aza<U+00F1>a]] government, provoking [[general strike]]s in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] and [[Zaragoza]], street conflicts in [[Madrid]] and [[Barcelona]], and, on [[October 6]], an armed miners' rebellion in [[Asturias]] and an [[Catalan nationalism|autonomist]] rebellion in [[Catalonia]]. Both rebellions were suppressed, and were followed by mass political arrests and trials. 

Lerroux's alliance with the right, his harsh repression of the revolt in 1934, and the [[Stra-Perlo]] scandal combined to leave him and his party with little support going into the 1936 election. (Lerroux himself lost his seat in parliament.)

As internal disagreements mounted in the coalition, strikes were frequent, and there were pistol attacks on unionists and clergy{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. In the elections of February 1936, the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] won a majority of the seats in parliament. The coalition, which included the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Party]] (PSOE), two [[liberal]] parties (the Republican Left Party of [[Manuel Aza<U+00F1>a]] and the Republican Union Party), and [[Communist Party of Spain]], as well as [[Galician nationalism|Galician]] and [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalists]], received 34.3 percent of the popular vote, compared to 33.2 percent for the National Front parties led by CEDA.<ref>[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/SPelections.htm 1936 Elections] on Spartacus Schoolnet. Accessed 11 October 2006.</ref> The [[Basque nationalism|Basque nationalists]] were not officially part of the Front, but were sympathetic to it. The anarchist trade union [[Confederaci<U+00F3>n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT), which had sat out previous elections, urged its members to vote for the Popular Front in response to a campaign promise of amnesty for jailed leftists. The Socialist Party refused to participate in the new government. Its leader, [[Largo Caballero]], hailed as "the Spanish Lenin" by ''[[Pravda]]'', told crowds that revolution was now inevitable. Privately, however, he aimed merely at ousting the liberals and other non-socialists from the cabinet. Moderate Socialists like [[Indalecio Prieto]] condemned the left's May Day marches, clenched fists, and talk of revolution as insanely provocative.<ref>Preston, Paul, [http://www.historytoday.com/dt_main_allatonce.asp?gid=12969&g12969=x&g9137=x&g30026=x&g20991=x&g21010=x&g19965=x&g19963=x&amid=12969&e=true "Spain 1936: From Coup d'Etat to Civil War,"] ''History Today'', Volume: 36 Issue: 7, July 1986, pp. 24-29</ref>

Without the Socialists, Prime Minister [[Manuel Aza<U+00F1>a]], a liberal who favored gradual reform while respecting the democratic process, led a minority government. In April, parliament replaced President [[Niceto Alcal<U+00E1>-Zamora]], a moderate who had alienated virtually all the parties, with Aza<U+00F1>a. Although the right also voted for Zamora's removal, this was a watershed event which inspired many conservatives to give up on parliamentary politics. Aza<U+00F1>a was the object of intense hate by Spanish rightists, who remembered how he had pushed a reform agenda through a recalcitrant parliament in 1931-33. Joaqu<U+00ED>n Arrar<U+00E1>s, a friend of [[Francisco Franco]]'s, called him "a repulsive caterpillar of red Spain."<ref name="Preston">Preston, Paul, [http://www.historytoday.com/dt_main_allatonce.asp?gid=13944&aid=&tgid=&amid=13944&g13944=x&g10713=x&g30026=x&g20991=x&g21010=x&g19965=x&g19963=x ''Franco and Aza<U+00F1>a''], Volume: 49 Issue: 5, May 1999, pp. 17-23</ref> The Spanish generals particularly disliked Aza<U+00F1>a because he had cut the army's budget and closed the military academy when he was war minister (1931). CEDA turned its campaign chest over to army plotter [[Emilio Mola]]. Monarchist [[Jos<U+00E9> Calvo Sotelo]] replaced CEDA's [[Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Gil-Robles y Qui<U+00F1>ones|Gil Robles]] as the right's leading spokesman in parliament.<ref name="Preston">Preston, Paul, op. cit.</ref>

This was a period of rising tensions. Radicals became more aggressive, while conservatives turned to paramilitary and vigilante actions. According to official sources, 330 people were assassinated and 1,511 were wounded in politically-related violence; records show 213 failed [[assassination]] attempts, 113 general strikes, and the destruction of 160 religious buildings.<ref name="carroll">The statistics on assassinations, destruction of religious buildings, etc. immediately before the start of the war come from ''The Last Crusade: Spain: 1936'' by Warren Carroll (Christendom Press, 1998). He collected the numbers from ''Historia de la Persecuci<U+00F3>n Religiosa en Espa<U+00F1>a (1936-1939)'' by Antonio Montero Moreno (Biblioteca de Autores Cristianos, 3rd edition, 1999).</ref>

==Deaths of Castillo & Calvo Sotelo==
On [[July 12]], [[1936]], [[Jos<U+00E9> Castillo (Spanish Civil War)|Jos<U+00E9> Castillo]], a member of the Socialist Party and lieutenant in the [[Assault Guards]], a special police corps created to deal with urban violence, was murdered by a 'far right' group in Madrid. The following day Jos<U+00E9> Calvo Sotelo, the leader of the conservative opposition in the Cortes (Spanish parliament), was killed in revenge by Luis Cuenca who was operating in a commando unit of the Civil Guard led by Captain Fernando Cond<U+00E9>s Romero.  Cond<U+00E9>s was close to the Socialist leader Indalecio Prieto, and although there is no indication that Prieto was complicit in Cuenca's decision to shoot Calvo Sotelo,  the assassination of a member of parliament aroused suspicions and strong reactions amongst the Center and the Right.<ref>Bull<U+00F3>n de Mendoza, Alfonso ''Calvo Sotelo: Vida y muerte'' (2004)  Barcelona. Thomas, Hugh ''The Spanish Civil War'' (1961, rev. 2001) New York pp. 196-198 and p.309.  Cond<U+00E9>s was a close personal friend of Castillo.  His squad had originally gone looking to arrest Gil Robles as a reprisal for Castillo's murder, but when Robles was not at home they went to the house of Calvo Sotelo. Thomas concluded that the intention of Cond<U+00E9>s was to arrest Calvo Sotelo and that Cuenca acted on his own initiative, although he acknowledges other sources that dispute this finding.  Cuenca and Cond<U+00E9>s were both killed in action in the first Rebel offensive against Madrid shortly after the start of the war.</ref> Calvo Sotelo was the most prominent Spanish monarchist and had protested against what he viewed as an escalating anti-religious terror, expropriations, and hasty agricultural reforms, which he considered [[Bolshevist]] and [[Anarchist]].  He instead advocated the creation of a [[Corporatism|corporative state]] and declared that if such a state was [[fascist]], he was also a fascist.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

He also declared that Spanish soldiers would be mad to not rise for Spain against Anarchy. In turn, the leader of the communists, [[Dolores Ibarruri]], known as ''La Pasionaria'', had vowed that Calvo Sotelo's speech would be his last speech in the ''Cortes''.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Although the Nationalist generals were already at advanced stages of planning an uprising, the event is seen by some as a catalyst for what followed.

==Nationalist military uprising==
[[Image:Toledo11ca0.jpg|thumb|200px|The ruins of the ''Alc<U+00E1>zar''. Nationalist troops held Toledo's Medieval castle against bombs, tanks, and planes.]]
On [[July 17]], [[1936]], the nationalist-traditionalist rebellion long feared by some in the Popular Front government began. Its start was signalled by the phrase "Over all of Spain, the sky is clear" that was broadcast on the radio. Casares Quiroga, who had succeeded Aza<U+00F1>a as prime minister, had in the previous weeks exiled the military officers suspected of conspiracy against the Republic, including General [[Manuel Goded y Llopis]] and General [[Francisco Franco]], sent to the [[Balearic Islands]] and to the [[Canary Islands]], respectively. Both generals immediately took control of these islands. Franco then flew to [[Spanish Morocco]] to see [[Juan March Ordinas]], where the Nationalist Army of Africa were almost unopposed in assuming control. The rising was intended to be a swift [[Coup d'<U+00E9>tat]], but was botched; conversely, the government was able to retain control of only part of the country. In this first stage, the rebels failed to take all major cities -- in [[Madrid]] they were hemmed into the Monta<U+00F1>a barracks. The barracks fell the next day with much bloodshed. In [[Barcelona]], [[anarchist]]s armed themselves and defeated the rebels. General Goded, who arrived from the Balearic islands, was captured and later executed. The anarchists would control Barcelona and much of the surrounding [[Aragon|Aragonese]] and [[Catalonia|Catalan]] countryside for months. The Republicans held on to [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] and controlled almost all of the Eastern Spanish coast and central area around Madrid. The Nationalists took most of the northwest apart from [[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and a southern area including [[C<U+00E1>diz]], [[Huelva]], [[Sevilla]], [[C<U+00F3>rdoba, Spain|C<U+00F3>rdoba]], and [[Granada]]; resistance in some of these areas led to reprisals.

==Factions in the war==
[[Image:PicassoGuernica.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Picasso's [[Guernica (painting)|''Guernica'']] was painted as a representation of the [[bombing of Gernika]]]]

The active participants in the war covered the entire gamut of the political positions and ideologies of the time. The Nationalist (''nacionales'') side included the [[Carlists]] and [[Legitimist]] monarchists, Spanish nationalists, fascists of the [[Falange]], [[Catholics]], and most conservatives and monarchist liberals. On the Republican side were [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] and [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan]] nationalists, [[socialism|socialist]]s, [[Communism|communists]], liberals and [[anarchism|anarchists]].

To view the political alignments from another perspective, the Nationalists included the majority of the Catholic clergy and of practising Catholics (outside of the Basque region), important elements of the army, most of the large landowners, and many businessmen. The Republicans included most urban workers, most peasants, and much of the educated middle class, especially those who were not entrepreneurs.
The genial monarchist General [[Jos<U+00E9> Sanjurjo]] was figurehead of the rebellion, while [[Emilio Mola]] was chief planner and second in command. Mola began serious planning in the spring, but General [[Francisco Franco]] hesitated until early July, inspiring other plotters to refer to him as "Miss [[Canary Islands]] 1936." Franco was a key player because of his prestige as a former director of the military academy and the man who suppressed the Socialist uprising of 1934. Warned that a military coup was imminent, leftists put barricades up on the roads on July 17. Franco avoided capture by taking a tugboat to the airport. From there he [[Dragon Rapide|flew to Morocco]], where he took command of the battle-hardened colonial army.<ref>Preston, Paul, [http://www.historytoday.com/dt_main_allatonce.asp?gid=12643&aid=&tgid=&amid=12643&g12643=x&g9105=x&g30026=x&g20991=x&g21010=x&g19965=x&g19963=x "From rebel to Caudillo: Franco's path to power,"] ''History Today'' Volume: 33 Issue: 11, November 1983, pp. 4-10 </ref> Sanjurjo was killed in a plane crash on July 20, leaving effective command split between Mola in the north and Franco in the South. Franco was chosen overall commander at a meeting of ranking generals at Salamanca on September 21. He outranked Mola and by this point his Army of Africa had demonstrated its military superiority.

One of the Nationalists' principal claimed motives was to confront the [[anticlericalism]] of the Republican regime and to defend the [[Roman Catholic Church]], which was censured for its support for the monarchy, which many on the Republican side blamed for the ills of the country. In the opening days of the war religious buildings were burnt without action on the part of the Republican authorities to prevent it. As part of the [[Spanish Revolution|social revolution]] taking place, others were turned into ''Houses of the People''.<ref name="CNTBarcelona">notes to the documentary [http://www.hastingsfreetv.org/documents/cnt_repotaje.html ''Reportaje Del Movimiento Revolucionario en Barcelona'', Hastings Free TV]</ref> Similarly, many of the massacres perpetrated by the Republican side targeted the Catholic Clergy. Franco's religious Moroccan [[Muslim]] troops found this repulsive and for the most part fought loyally and often ferociously for the Nationalists. Articles 24 and 26 of the Constitution of the [[Spanish Republic|Republic]] had banned the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], which deeply offended many of the Nationalists. After the beginning of the Nationalist coup, anger flared anew at the Church and its role in Spanish politics. Notwithstanding these religious matters, the Basque nationalists, who nearly all sided with the Republic, were, for the most part, practicing Catholics. [[Pope John Paul II]] later canonised several people murdered for being priests or nuns. <ref name="MRPSCW"> Thousands of [[Servant of God]] candidates for sainthood have been accepted by the Vatican [http://newsaints.faithweb.com/martyrs/MSPC.htm "General Index MARTYRS OF THE RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION DURING THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR (X 1934, 36-39)"]</ref>

==Foreign involvement==

:''For a more detailed listing of foreign personel and war supplies see [[Spanish Civil War and Foreign Involvement]]''

The rebellion was opposed by the government (with the troops that remained loyal to the Republic), as well as by the vast majority of urban workers, who were often members of [[Socialism|Socialist]], [[Communism|Communist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] groups.

[[Image:T-26tankinSpain.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A Republican [[T-26]] tank in the streets of Madrid.]]
The [[United Kingdom|British]] government proclaimed itself [[Neutral country|neutral]]; however, the British ambassador to Spain, Sir [[Henry Chilton]], believed that a victory for Franco was in Britain's best interests and worked to support the Nationalists. British Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] publicly maintained the official policy of non-intervention but privately expressed his desire that the Republicans win the war {{Fact|date=February 2007}}.  [[Ernle Chatfield, 1st Baron Chatfield|Admiral Lord Charfield]], British [[First Sea Lord]] at the time of the conflict, was an admirer of Franco and, with or without Government support, the British [[Royal Navy]] favoured the Nationalists during the conflict.<ref name="Beevor">Beevor, Antony (2001 reissued). The Spanish Civil War. London: Penguin. ISBN 0-14-100148-8.</ref> As well as permitting Franco to set up a signals base on [[Gibraltar]], the Germans were allowed to overfly Gibraltar during the airlift of the [[Spanish Army of Africa|Army of Africa]] to [[Seville]].  The Royal Navy also provided information on Republican shipping to the Nationalists, and ''[[HMS Queen Elizabeth]]'' was used to prevent the Republican navy shelling the port of [[Algeciras]].  The German [[charg<U+00E9> d'affaires]] reported that the British were supplying ammunition to the Republicans, as well as passing on  information about Russian arms shipments to the Germans. During the fighting for [[Bilbao]] the Royal Navy supported the Nationalist line that the [[Nervi<U+00F3>n|River Nervi<U+00F3>n]] was mined, telling British shipping to keep clear of the area - and were badly discredited when a British vessel ignored the advice and sailed into the city, finding the river unmined as the Republicans had claimed.<ref name="Beevor" /> Despite this, Britain discouraged activity by its citizens supporting either side.

The Anglo-French arms embargo meant that the Republicans' only foreign source of [[materiel|materi<U+00E9>l]] was the USSR while the Nationalists received weapons from Italy and Germany and logistical support from Portugal.  The last Republican prime minister, Juan Negr<U+00ED>n, hoped that a general outbreak of war in Europe would compel the European powers (mainly Britain and France) to finally help the Republic, but World War II would not commence until months after the Spanish conflict had ended. Ultimately neither Britain nor France intervened to any significant extent. Britain supplied food and medicine to the Republic, but actively discouraged the French government of [[L<U+00E9>on Blum]] from supplying weapons.  The American Ambassador to Spain, was to later condemn the the [[League of Nations]] Non-Intervention Committee, saying that each of their moves had been made to serve the cause of the rebellion, and that 'This committee was the most cynical and lamentably dishonest group that history has known.'<ref name="Beevor" />

Both [[Italy]] under [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] under [[Hitler]] violated the embargo and sent troops (''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'' and ''[[Condor Legion]]''), aircraft, and weapons to support Franco. The Italian contribution amounted to over 60,000 troops at the height of the war, and the involvement helped to increase Mussolini's popularity among Italian Catholics, as the latter had remained highly critical of their ex-Socialist fascist ''[[Duce]]''.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Italian military help to Nationalists against the anti-clerical and anti-Catholic atrocities committed by the Republican side, worked well in Italian propaganda targeting Catholics. On July 27, 1936 the first squadron of Italian airplanes sent by Benito Mussolini arrived in Spain.<ref>Speech delivered by Premier Benito Mussolini. Rome, Italy, February 23, 1941</ref> It has been speculated that Hitler used the Spanish Civil War issue to distract Mussolini from Hitler's own designs on and plans for [[Austria]] (''[[Anschluss]]''), as the authoritarian Catholic, anti-Nazi [[Patriotic Front (Austria)|V<U+00E4>terl<U+00E4>ndische Front]] government of autonomous Austria had been in alliance with Mussolini, and in 1934, the assassination of Austria's authoritarian president [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] had already successfully invoked Italian military assistance in case of a Nazi German invasion.

[[Image:S12.jpeg|thumb|175px|Republican propaganda pays homage to the International Brigades.]]
In addition, there were a few volunteer troops from other nations who fought with the Nationalists, such as some [[The Blueshirts|Irish Blueshirts]] under [[Eoin O'Duffy]] and the French [[Croix de Feu]]. Although these volunteers, primarily Catholics, came from around the world (including Ireland, Brazil, and the USA), there were less of them and they are not as famous as those fighting on the Republican side, and were generally less organized and hence embedded in Nationalist units whereas many Republican units were comprised entirely of foreigners.

Due to the Franco-British arms embargo, the Government of the Republic could receive material aid and could purchase arms only from the [[Soviet Union]]. These arms included 1,000 aircraft, 900 tanks, 1,500 artillery pieces, 300 armored cars, hundreds of thousands of small arms, and 30,000 tons of ammunition (some of which was defective). To pay for these armaments the Republicans used [[United States dollar|US$]]500 million in gold reserves. At the start of the war the [[Bank of Spain]] had the world's fourth largest reserve of gold, about US$750 million,<ref>[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/SPrussia.htm Soviet Union] in the Spartacus Schoolnet series on the Spanish Civil War. Accessed 12 October 2006.</ref> although some assets were frozen by the French and British governments. The Soviet Union also sent more than 2,000 personnel, mainly [[tank]] crews and [[Aviator|pilots]], who actively participated in combat, on the Republican side.<ref> [http://www.oneparty.co.uk/compass/compass/com12301.html The Soviet Union and the Spanish Civil War], ''Compass'',  April 1996, No. 123 (published by Communist League, UK).

Accessed 12 October 2006.</ref> Later, the "[[Moscow gold]]" was an issue during the [[Spanish transition to democracy]].  They have also been accused of prolonging the war because Stalin knew that Britain and France would never accept a communist government. Though Stalin did call for the repression of Republican elements that were hostile to the Soviet Union (for example, the anti-Stalininst [[POUM]]), he also made a conscious effort to limit Soviet involvement in the struggle and silence its revolutionary aspects in an attempt to remain on good diplomatic terms with the French and British.<ref>Paul Preston, <U+201C>A Concise History of the Spanish Civil War<U+201D>, (London, 1986), p.107</ref> [[Mexico]] also aided the Republicans by providing rifles and food. Throughout the war, the efforts of the elected government of the Republic to resist the rebel army were hampered by Franco-British 'non-intervention', long supply lines and intermittent availability of weapons of widely variable quality.

[[Image:Batall<U+00F3>n Lincoln.jpg|thumb|250px|American veterans.]]
Volunteers from many countries fought in Spain, most of them on the Republican side. 60,000 men and women fought in the [[International Brigades]], including the American [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]] and Canadian [[Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion]], organised in close conjunction with the [[Comintern]] to aid the Spanish Republicans. Others fought as members of the [[Confederaci<U+00F3>n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification|POUM]] militias. Those fighting with POUM most famously included [[George Orwell]] and the small [[ILP Contingent]].

'Spain' became the [[cause c<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>bre]] for the left-leaning intelligentsia across the Western world, and many prominent artists and writers entered the Republic's service. As well, it attracted a large number of foreign left-wing working class men, for whom the war offered not only idealistic adventure but also an escape from post-Depression unemployment. Among the more famous foreigners participating on the Republic's side were [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[George Orwell]], who went on to write about his experiences in ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''. Orwell's novel ''[[Animal Farm]]'' was loosely inspired by his experiences and those of other members of [[POUM]], at the hands of [[Stalinist]]s when the Popular Front began to fight within itself, as were the torture scenes in ''[[1984 (novel)|1984]]''. Hemingway's novel ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' was inspired by his experiences in Spain.  [[George Seldes]] reported on the war for the [[New York Post]]. The third part of [[Laurie Lee]]'s autobiographical trilogy ('A Moment of War') is also based on his Civil War experiences, (though the accuracy of some of his recollections has been disputed). [[Norman Bethune]] used the opportunity to develop the special skills of [[battlefield medicine]]. As a casual visitor, [[Errol Flynn]] used a fake report of his death at the battlefront to promote his movies. Despite the predominantly leftist attitude of the artistic community, several prominent writers such as [[Ezra Pound]], [[Roy Campbell]], [[Gertrude Stein]], and [[Evelyn Waugh]] sided with Franco.

[[Image:Dabrowszczacy przysiegaja wiernosc sprawie Republiki.jpg|thumb|275px|Polish volunteers.]]
The United States was isolationist, neutralist, and was little concerned with what it largely saw as an internal matter in a European country. Nevertheless, from the outset the Nationalists received important support from some elements of American business. The American-owned [[Vacuum Oil Company]] in [[Tangier]], for example, refused to sell to Republican ships and the [[Texas Oil Company]] supplied gasoline on credit to Franco until the war's end. While not supported officially, many American volunteers such as the [[Abraham Lincoln Battalion]] fought for the Republicans. Many in these countries were also shocked by the violence practiced by anarchist and POUM militias - and reported by a relatively free press in the Republican zone - and feared Stalinist influence over the Republican government. Reprisals, assassinations and other atrocities in the rebel zone were, of course, not reported nearly as widely. 

Germany and the USSR used the war as a testing ground for faster tanks and aircraft that were just becoming available at the time. The [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighter and [[Junkers Ju 52]] transport/bomber were both used in the Spanish Civil War. The Soviets provided [[Polikarpov I-15]] and [[Polikarpov I-16]] fighters. The Spanish Civil War was also an example of [[total war]], where the killing of civilians such as the [[bombing of Gernika|bombing of the Basque town of Gernika]] by the [[Legi<U+00F3>n C<U+00F3>ndor]], as depicted by [[Pablo Picasso]] in the painting "[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]", foreshadowed episodes of [[World War II]] such as the bombing campaign on Britain by the Nazis and the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] or Hamburg by the Allies.

The extent of foreign involvement in the conflict has led some commentators (most notably [[Paul Preston]]) to view it as part of a wider integrated [[European Civil War]].

As war proceeded in the Northern front, the Republican authorities arranged the evacuation of children. These [[Spanish War children]] were shipped to Britain, Belgium, the Soviet Union and other European countries. Those in Western European countries returned to their families after the war, but many of those in the Soviet Union, from Communist families, remained and experienced the Second World War and the [[fall of the Soviet Union]]. 

Like the Republican side, the Nationalist side of Franco also arranged evacuations of children, women and elderly from war zones. Refugee camps for those civilians evacuated by the Nationalists were set up in [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], [[Third Reich|Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]].

==Pacifism in Spain==
In the 1930s Spain also became a focus for [[pacifist]] organisations including the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] and the [[War Resisters' International]] whose president was the British MP and [[Labour party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[George Lansbury]]. Prominent Spanish pacifists such as [[Amparo Poch y Gasc<U+00F3>n]] and [[Jos<U+00E9> Brocca]] supported the Republicans. Brocca argued that Spanish pacifists had no alternative but to make a stand against fascism. He put this stand into practice by various means including organising agricultural workers to maintain food supplies and through humanitarian work with war refugees.

== The war: 1936 ==
[[Image:Agosto Septiembre 1936.png|right|300px|Spanish Civil War. Situation of the fronts in August-September 1936]]
:''For a fully detailed chronology see [[Spanish Civil War chronology 1936]].
In the early days of the war, over 50,000 people who were caught on the "wrong" side of the lines were assassinated or summarily [[execution (legal)|executed]]. The numbers were probably comparable on both sides. In these ''paseos'' ("promenades"), as the executions were called, the victims were taken from their refuges or jails by armed people to be shot outside of town. The corpses were abandoned or interred in digs made by the victims themselves. Local police just noted the apparition of the corpses. Probably the most famous such victim was the poet and dramatist [[Federico Garc<U+00ED>a Lorca]]. The outbreak of the war provided an excuse for settling accounts and resolving long-standing feuds. Thus, this practice became widespread during the war in areas conquered. In most areas, even within a single given village, both sides committed assassinations.
[[Image:Orkomosiakz9.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Carlist units are blessed by a [[chaplain]] of the Nationalist forces.]]

Any hope of a quick ending to the war was dashed on [[July 21]], the fifth day of the rebellion, when the Nationalists captured the main [[Spanish Navy|Spanish naval base]] at [[Ferrol]] in northwestern Spain. This encouraged the Fascist nations of [[Europe]] to help Franco, who had already contacted the governments of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy]] the day before. On July 26, the future [[Axis Powers]] cast their lot with the Nationalists. Nationalist forces under Franco won another great victory on [[September 27]] when they [[Siege of the Alc<U+00E1>zar|relieved the Alc<U+00E1>zar]] at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. 

[[Image:Pipistrellobombing.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Nationalist aircraft bomb Madrid in late November 1936.]]
A Nationalist garrison under [[Jos<U+00E9> Moscard<U+00F3> Ituarte|Colonel Moscardo]] had held the [[Alc<U+00E1>zar of Toledo|Alc<U+00E1>zar]] in the center of the city since the beginning of the rebellion, resisting for months against thousands of Republican troops who completely surrounded the isolated building. The inability to take the Alc<U+00E1>zar was a serious blow to the prestige of the Republic, as it was considered inexplicable in view of their numerical superiority in the area. Two days after relieveing the siege, Franco proclaimed himself ''[[General<U+00ED>simo]]'' and ''[[Caudillo]]'' ("chieftain") while forcibly unifying the various [[Falange|Falangist]] and Royalist elements of the Nationalist cause. In October, the Nationalists launched a major offensive toward [[Madrid]], reaching it in early November and launching a major assault on the city on [[November 8]]. The Republican government was forced to shift from Madrid to [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], out of the combat zone, on [[November 6]]. However, the Nationalists' attack on the capital was repulsed in fierce fighting between November 8 and 23. A contributory factor in the successful Republican defence was the arrival of the [[International Brigades]], though only around 3000 of them participated in the battle. Having failed to take the capital, Franco bombarded it from the air and, in the following two years, mounted several offensives to try to encircle Madrid. (See also [[Siege of Madrid (1936-39)]])

On [[November 18]], Germany and Italy officially recognized the Franco regime, and on [[December 23]], [[Italy]] sent "volunteers" of its own to fight for the Nationalists.

==The war: 1937==
:''For a much more detailed chronology see [[Spanish Civil War chronology 1937]]''
With his ranks being swelled by Italian troops and Spanish colonial soldiers from Morocco, Franco made another attempt to capture Madrid in January and February of 1937, but failed again. 

[[Image:Entrada de las Fuerzas Nacionales en Santander 26 de Agosto de 1937.jpg|thumb|300px|Nationalist troops enter Santander on [[August 26]], [[1937]].]]
On [[February 21]] the League of Nations Non-Intervention Committee ban on foreign national "[[Unlawful combatant|volunteers]]" went into effect. The large city of [[M<U+00E1>laga]] [[Battle of M<U+00E1>laga|was taken]] on [[February 8]]. On [[March 7]]  German [[Condor Legion]] equipped with [[Heinkel He 51]] biplanes arrived in Spain; on [[April 26]] they [[Bombing of Gernika|bombed]] the town of [[Guernica]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]; two days later, Franco's men entered the town. 

After the fall of Gernika, the Republican government began to fight back with increasing effectiveness. In July, they made a move to recapture [[Segovia]], forcing Franco to pull troops away from the Madrid front to halt their advance. Mola, Franco's second-in-command, was killed on June 3, and in early July, despite the fall of [[Bilbao]] in June, the government actually launched a strong counter-offensive in the Madrid area, which the Nationalists repulsed with some difficulty. The clash was called "[[Battle of Brunete]]" (Brunete is a town in the [[Madrid (autonomous community)|province of Madrid]]).

After that, Franco regained the initiative, invading [[Aragon]] in August and then [[Battle of Santander|taking]] the city of [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] (now in [[Cantabria]]). Two months of bitter fighting followed and, despite determined Asturian resistance, [[Gij<U+00F3>n]] (in [[Asturias]]) fell in late October, which effectively ended the war in the North.

Meanwhile, on [[August 28]], the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] recognized Franco (possibly under pressure from Mussolini), and at the end of November, with the Nationalists closing in on [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], the government moved again, to [[Barcelona]].

==The war: 1938==
:''For a much more detailed chronology see [[Spanish Civil War chronology 1938-1939]]''
[[Image:terualsiege.jpg|200px|thumb|left|A Republican soldier seeks cover on the Plaza de Toros in [[Teruel]].]]
The battle of Teruel was an important confrontation between Nationalists and Republicans. The city belonged to the Nationalists at the beginning of the battle, but the Republicans conquered it in January. The Nationalists launched an offensive and recovered the city by [[February 22]]. On [[April 14]], the Nationalists broke through to the [[Mediterranean Sea]], cutting the government-held portion of Spain in two. The government tried to sue for peace in May, but Franco demanded unconditional surrender, and the war raged on.

[[Image:Noviembre 1938.png|right|300px|Spanish Civil War. Situation of the fronts in November of 1938]]
The government now launched an all-out campaign to reconnect their territory in the [[Battle of the Ebro]], beginning on [[July 24]] and lasting until [[November 26]]. The campaign was militarily successful, but was fatally undermined by the Franco-British appeasement of [[Hitler]] in [[Munich]]. The concession of [[Czechoslovakia]] destroyed the last vestiges of Republican morale by ending all hope of an anti-fascist alliance with the great powers. The retreat from the Ebro all but determined the final outcome of the war. Eight days before the new year, Franco struck back by throwing massive forces into an invasion of [[Catalonia]].

==The war: 1939==
:''For a much more detailed chronology see [[Spanish Civil War chronology 1938-1939]]''

[[Image:Spain final-guerra-civil.jpg|thumb|Franco declares the end of the war. However, small pockets of insurgents still fought.]]

The Nationalists conquered Catalonia in a whirlwind campaign during the first two months of 1939. [[Tarragona]] fell on [[January 14]], followed by [[Barcelona]] on [[January 26]] and [[Girona]] on [[February 5]]. Five days after the fall of Girona, the last resistance in Catalonia was broken.

On [[February 27]], the governments of the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] recognized the Franco regime.

Only [[Madrid]] and a few other strongholds remained for the government forces. On [[March 28]], with the help of pro-Franco forces inside the city (the "[[fifth column]]" General Mola had mentioned in [[propaganda]] broadcasts in 1936), Madrid fell to the Nationalists. The next day, [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], which had held out under the guns of the Nationalists for close to two years, also surrendered. Victory was proclaimed on [[April 1]], when the last of the Republican forces surrendered.

After the end of the War, there were harsh reprisals against Franco's former enemies on the left, when thousands of Republicans were imprisoned and between 10,000 and 28,000 executed. Many other Republicans fled abroad, especially to France and Mexico.

==Social revolution==
{{main|Spanish Revolution}}

:''For for the anti-religious persecution caused by the social revolution see [[Religious Persecution in the Spanish Civil War]]''

In the anarchist-controlled areas, [[Aragon]] and [[Catalonia]], in addition to the temporary military success, there was a vast [[social revolution]] in which the workers and the peasants [[collectivisation|collectivised]] [[Land rights|land]] and [[industry]], and set up councils parallel to the paralyzed Republican government. This revolution was opposed by both the Soviet-supported communists, who ultimately took their orders from Stalin's politburo (which feared a loss of control), and the [[Social Democratic]] Republicans (who worried about the loss of civil property rights). The [[agrarian collectives]] had considerable success despite opposition and lack of resources, as Franco had already captured lands with some of the richest natural resources.

As the war progressed, the government and the communists were able to leverage their access to Soviet arms to restore government control over the war effort, both through diplomacy and force.  [[Anarchist]]s and the [[POUM]] were integrated with the regular army, albeit with resistance; the POUM was outlawed and falsely denounced as an instrument of the fascists.  In the ''[[Barcelona May Days|May Days]]'' of 1937, many hundreds or thousands of anti-fascist soldiers fought one another for control of strategic points in [[Barcelona]], recounted by [[George Orwell]] in '' [[Homage to Catalonia]]''.

[[Image:Brigde at Ronda, Spain.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Puente Nuevo]], the bridge that links together the two parts of [[Ronda]] in Spain. Behind the window near the center of the bridge is a prison cell. There have been allegations that during the Civil War the nationalists threw people who supported the Republicans from the bridge to their deaths many meters down at the bottom of the El Tajo canyon.  On the other hand, authorities confirm the atrocities committed by the Republicans against the Nationalists at Ronda.  "Thus the description in Ernest Hemingway's novel ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' of how the inhabitants of a small ''pueblo'' first beat all male members of the middle class with heavy flails and then flung them over a cliff is near to the reality of what happened in the superb Andalusian town of Ronda.  There 512 were murdered in the first month of the war."  <ref> Hugh Thomas, ''The Spanish Civil War'', (1961) p. 176 </ref>]]
