'''Quatuor Habanera''' are one of the world's leading saxophone quartets.  Established in 1993, after study at [[Conservatoire de Paris]], the quartet has won seven international prizes and recorded six albums.  Their ability to adapt to varied musical styles is noted, recording contemporary music of Ligeti, Xenakis, Donatoni as successfully as earlier works by Glazunov, Grieg and Dvorak. Though formally classical musicians, they are all capable improvisers and have collaborated with many jazz musicians, most notably [[Louis Sclavis]] and klezmer clarinetist [[David Krakauer]].
