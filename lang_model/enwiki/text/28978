'''SMS ''Graudenz''''' was the [[lead ship]] of the [[Graudenz class light cruiser|her class]] of [[light cruiser]]s. She had one sister ship, {{SMS|Regensburg}}. The ship was built by the [[German Empire|German]] ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial Navy) in the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|''Kaiserliche Werft'']] shipyard in [[Kiel]], laid down in 1912 and commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] in August 1914, days after the outbreak of [[World War I]]. She was named for the German town of [[Grudzi<U+0105>dz|Graudenz]]. The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve [[10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun|10.5&nbsp;cm SK L/45 guns]] and had a top speed of {{convert|27.5|kn}}.

''Graudenz'' saw extensive service during World War I, including serving as part of the reconnaissance screen for the [[battlecruiser]]s of the [[I Scouting Group]] during the [[raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby]] in December 1914. The ship also took part in the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]] in January 1915, and the [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga]] in August 1915. She had been damaged by a [[naval mine|mine]] and was unable to participate in the [[Battle of Jutland]] in May 1916. She was assigned to the planned final operation of the High Seas Fleet in October 1918, weeks before the end of the war, but [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|a major mutiny]] forced the cancellation of the plan. After the end of the war, the ship was ceded to Italy as a [[war prize]] and commissioned into the [[Italian Navy]] as ''Arcona''; she remained in service until 1937 when she was stricken and broken up for scrap.

''Graudenz'' was ordered under the contract name "''[[Ersatz]]'' {{SMS|Prinzess Wilhelm||2}}"<ref group=Note>In German, "Prinzess" is rendered "Prinze<U+00DF>."</ref><ref group=Note>"Ersatz" means "replacement"; ships in the German Navy were ordered either as replacements for worn out vessels&mdash;in this case, a replacement for the old cruiser {{SMS|Prinzess Wilhelm}}&mdash;or as an increase in the size of the fleet. These ships were given a letter designation.</ref> and was laid down at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|''Kaiserliche Werft'']] shipyard in [[Kiel]] in 1912 and was launched on 25 October 1913. At her launch, the mayor of [[Graudenz]], Dr. K<U+00FC>hnast, christened the ship.<ref>Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr, & Steinmetz, p. 245</ref> She was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] on 10 August 1914.<ref name=G10910>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 109<U+2013>110</ref> The ship was {{convert|142.7|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|13.8|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.75|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|6382|MT|abbr=on}} at full combat load.<ref name=G110>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 110</ref> Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of Marine [[steam turbine]]s driving two {{convert|3.5|m|adj=on|sp=us}} propellers. They were designed to give {{convert|26000|shp|lk=in}}. These were powered by ten coal-fired Marine-type [[water-tube boiler]]s and two oil-fired double-ended boilers. These gave the ship a top speed of {{convert|27.5|kn}}. ''Graudenz'' carried {{convert|1280|MT|LT|abbr=on}} of coal, and an additional {{convert|375|MT|LT|abbr=on}} of oil that gave her a range of approximately {{convert|5500|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}. She had a crew of 21 officers and 364 enlisted men.<ref name=G10910/>

The ship was armed with twelve [[10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun|10.5&nbsp;cm SK L/45 guns]] in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the [[forecastle]], eight were located amidships, four on either side, and two in a [[superfire|superfiring pair]] aft.<ref name=C161>Gardiner & Gray, p. 161</ref> The guns had a maximum elevation of 30&nbsp;degrees, which allowed them to engage targets out to {{convert|12700|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 140</ref> These were later replaced with seven [[15 cm SK L/45]] guns and two 8.8 cm SK L/45 anti-aircraft guns. She was also equipped with a pair of {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s with five [[torpedo]]es submerged in the hull on the [[broadside]]. Two deck-mounted launchers were added when the gun armament was upgraded. She also could also carry 120 [[naval mine|mines]]. The ship was protected by a waterline [[armored belt]] that was {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on}} thick amidships. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides, and the deck was covered with up to 60&nbsp;mm thick armor plate.<ref name=G109>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 109</ref>

==Service history==
''Graudenz''{{'}}s first operation was the [[raid on Yarmouth]] on 3 November 1914. She formed part of the reconnaissance screen for the [[battlecruiser]]s of [[Rear Admiral]] [[Franz von Hipper]]'s [[I Scouting Group]], along with the cruisers {{SMS|Kolberg||2}} and {{SMS|Strassburg||2}}. The bombardment was conducted without incident, but on the return, the [[armored cruiser]] {{SMS|Yorck||2}} struck a German mine outside [[Wilhelmshaven]] and sank.<ref>Wyllie & Wren, p. 128</ref> She was also present for the [[raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby]] on 15<U+2013>16 December 1914.<ref>Tarrant, p. 31</ref> After completing the bombardment of the towns, the Germans began to withdraw, though British forces moved to intercept them. ''Graudenz'', ''Stralsund'', ''Strassburg'', and two flotillas of [[torpedo boat]]s steamed between two British squadrons. In the heavy mist, which reduced visibility to less than {{convert|4000|yd|abbr=on}}, only ''Stralsund'' was spotted, though only briefly. The Germans were able to use the bad weather to cover their withdrawal.<ref>Tarrant, p. 34</ref> ''Graudenz'' again screened for the I Scouting Group for the sortie out to the [[Dogger Bank]] on 24 January 1915.<ref>Tarrant, p. 36</ref> In the ensuing [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]], the large armored cruiser {{SMS|Bl<U+00FC>cher||2}} was sunk.<ref>Scheer, pp. 80<U+2013>85</ref>

In August 1915, ''Graudenz'' went into the Baltic for a major operation to clear the [[Gulf of Riga]] of Russian naval forces. Eight [[dreadnought]]s and three battlecruisers from the High Seas Fleet were detached for the operation. ''Graudenz'' participated in the second attack on 16 August, led by the dreadnoughts {{SMS|Nassau||2}} and {{SMS|Posen||2}}.<ref>Halpern, p. 197</ref> The minesweepers cleared the Russian minefields by the 20th, allowing the German squadron to enter the Gulf. The Russians had by this time withdrawn to [[Moon Sound]], and the threat of Russian [[submarine]]s and mines in the Gulf prompted the Germans to retreat. The major units of the High Seas Fleet were back in the North Sea before the end of August.<ref>Halpern, p. 198</ref> ''Graudenz'' struck a mine in mid 1916, and was in drydock for repairs in May 1916. As a result, she was unavailable for the fleet operation that resulted in the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May <U+2212> 1 June 1916.<ref>Campbell, p. 23</ref> For the remainder of the war, she served as a torpedo boat flotilla leader.<ref name=G109/>

By October 1918, ''Graudenz'' was assigned to the [[II Scouting Group]], which was to participate in a final, climactic attack by the High Seas Fleet. The planned operation called for raids on Allied shipping in the [[Thames estuary]] and [[Flanders]] to draw out the [[Grand Fleet]]. ''Graudenz'', {{SMS|Karlsruhe|1916|2}} and {{SMS|N<U+00FC>rnberg|1916|2}} were assigned to the force tasked with attacking Flanders.<ref>Woodward, pp. 115<U+2013>116</ref> On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on {{SMS|Th<U+00FC>ringen||2}} and then on several other battleships [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|mutinied]].<ref>Tarrant, pp. 281<U+2013>282</ref> The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation.<ref name=T282>Tarrant, p. 282</ref> Commodore [[Andreas Michelsen]] organized a force of light craft, including light cruisers, [[destroyer]]s, and [[U-boat]]s to oppose a possible British attack while the heavy units of the fleet were in disarray; he chose ''Graudenz'' as his [[flagship]].<ref>Woodward, pp. 167<U+2013>168</ref>

''Graudenz'' served with the newly reorganized ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' in the aftermath of the war, through 1919. She was stricken from the [[naval register]] on 10 March 1920 and surrendered to the Allies as a [[war prize]]. She was transferred to Italy on 1 June 1920 under the name "E" in the French port of [[Cherbourg]]. She was placed in Italian service and renamed ''Ancona''.<ref name=G109/> She was overhauled starting in 1921 through 1924. Her coal storage space was reduced from {{convert|1280|MT|abbr=on}} to {{convert|900|MT}} and her oil bunker capacity was correspondingly increased from {{convert|375|MT|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1520|MT|abbr=on}}. ''Ancona'' was commissioned into the Italian Navy on 6 May 1925. She was provided with equipment to handle an [[Macchi M.7]] [[seaplane]] in 1926. The ship's bow and [[forecastle]] were lengthened between 1928 and 1929 to mount a [[catapult]] for the seaplane.<ref name=GG264>Gardiner & Gray, p. 264</ref> She remained in service until 1932 when she was placed in reserve in [[Taranto]].<ref>Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 286</ref> She was stricken on 11 March 1937 and subsequently broken up.<ref name=GG264/>
