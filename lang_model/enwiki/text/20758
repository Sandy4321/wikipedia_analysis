{{Ulysses Grant sidebar}}
'''Ulysses S. Grant''' (born '''Hiram Ulysses Grant'''; April 27, 1822 <U+2013> July 23, 1885) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|18th]] president of the United States (1869<U+2013>1877) following his success as military commander in the [[American Civil War]]. Under Grant, the [[Union Army]] defeated the [[Military of the Confederate States of America|Confederate military]]; the war, and [[Secession in the United States|secession]], ended with the surrender of [[Robert E. Lee]]'s army at Appomattox. As president, Grant led the [[Radical Republicans]] in their effort to eliminate vestiges of Confederate nationalism and slavery, protect [[African American]] citizenship, and defeat the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. In foreign policy, Grant sought to increase American trade and influence while remaining at peace with the world. Although his [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] split in 1872 as reformers denounced him, Grant was easily reelected.  During his second term the country's economy was devastated by the [[Panic of 1873]], while investigations exposed corruption scandals in the administration. The [[Redeemers|conservative white Southerners]] regained control of Southern state governments and Democrats took control of the federal House of Representatives. By the time Grant left the White House in 1877, his Reconstruction policies were being undone.

A career soldier, Grant graduated from the [[United States Military Academy|United States Military Academy at West Point]] and served in the [[Mexican<U+2013>American War]].  When the Civil War began in 1861, he rejoined the Union army. In 1862, Grant was promoted to major general and took control of [[Kentucky]] and most of [[Tennessee]].  He then led Union forces to victory after initial setbacks in the [[Battle of Shiloh]], earning a reputation as an aggressive commander. In July 1863, Grant defeated Confederate armies and seized [[Vicksburg Campaign|Vicksburg]], giving the Union control of the [[Mississippi River]] and dividing the Confederacy in two. After the [[Chattanooga Campaign|Battle of Chattanooga]] in late 1863, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] promoted Grant to lieutenant general and commander of all of the Union armies.  As commander, Grant confronted Robert E. Lee in a series of bloody battles in 1864, which ended with Grant trapping Lee at [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg, Virginia]]. During the siege, Grant coordinated a series of devastating campaigns launched by generals [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], [[Philip Sheridan]], and [[George Henry Thomas]] in other theaters. Finally breaking through Lee's trenches, the Union Army captured Richmond in April 1865. Lee surrendered his depleted forces to Grant at Appomattox as the Confederacy collapsed. Most historians have hailed Grant's military genius, despite losses of men.{{sfn|Bonekemper 2004|pp=271<U+2013>82}}

After the Civil War, Grant served two terms as president and worked to stabilize the nation during the turbulent [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] period that followed.  He enforced civil rights laws and fought Ku Klux Klan violence.  Grant encouraged passage of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]], giving protection for African-American voting rights. He used the army to build the Republican Party in the South, based on black voters, Northern newcomers ("[[Carpetbaggers]]"), and native Southern white supporters ("[[Scalawags]]"). As a result, African-Americans were represented in the Congress for the first time in American history in 1870. Although there were some gains in political and civil rights by African Americans in the early 1870s, by the time Grant left office in 1877, Democrats in the South had regained control of state governments, while most blacks lost their political power for nearly a century. Although Grant's Indian peace policy reduced Indian violence and created the [[Board of Indian Commissioners]], conflict continued that culminated in the [[Battle of the Little Big Horn]].  In the long run, even his supporters agreed that his policies were unsuccessful. Grant's reputation fell as the economy plunged into the United States' first industrial depression, called the Panic of 1873.  In his second term, Grant had to respond to a series of Congressional investigations into financial corruption in the government, including bribery charges against two cabinet members.

Grant's foreign policy, led by Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]], settled the [[Alabama Claims]] with Britain and avoided war with [[Spain]] over the [[Virginius Affair]], but his attempted [[Annexation of Santo Domingo|annexation of the Dominican Republic]] failed. Grant's response to the Panic of 1873 gave some financial relief to New York banking houses, but was ineffective in stopping the five-year industrial depression that followed.  After leaving office, Grant embarked on a two-year world tour that included many enthusiastic receptions.  In 1880, he made an unsuccessful bid for a third presidential term.  However, [[Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant|his memoirs]], written as he was dying, were a critical and popular success, and his death prompted an outpouring of national mourning. Historians have, until recently, ranked Grant as nearly the worst president; Grant's reputation was marred by his defense of corrupt appointees and by his conservative deflationary policy during the Panic of 1873. {{sfnm|Brands 2012b||1p=44|Murray & Blessing||2p=55}}  While still below average, his [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|reputation among scholars]] has significantly improved in recent years because of greater appreciation for his commitment to civil rights, moral courage in his prosecution of the Ku Klux Klan, and enforcement of voting rights.{{sfn|Brands 2012b|p=44}}

==Early life and family==
[[File:Brevet Second Lieutenant Ulysses S. Grant in 1843.jpg|thumb|2nd Lt U.S. Grant in 1843]]
{{main|Early life and career of Ulysses S. Grant}}
Hiram Ulysses Grant was born in [[Point Pleasant, Ohio]], on April 27, 1822, to Jesse Root Grant, a [[Tanner (occupation)|tanner]] and businessman, and Hannah (Simpson) Grant.{{sfn|Smith|pp=21<U+2013>22}}  Jesse Grant was a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] with abolitionist sentiments.{{sfn|Hesseltine|p=4}}  In the fall of 1823, the family moved to the village of [[Georgetown, Ohio|Georgetown]] in [[Brown County, Ohio]].  Raised in a [[Methodist]] family devoid of religious pretension, Grant prayed privately and was not an official member of the church.{{sfnm|Farina||1pp=13<U+2013>14|Simpson|2000|2pp=2<U+2013>3}} Unlike his younger siblings, Grant was neither disciplined, baptized, nor forced to attend church by his parents.{{sfn|Longacre|pp=6<U+2013>7}} One of his biographers suggests that Grant inherited a degree of introversion from his reserved, even "uncommonly detached" mother. (She never took occasion to visit the White House during her son's presidency.){{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=8}} Grant developed an unusual ability to work with, and control, horses in his charge, and became known as a capable horseman.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=10}}

When Grant was 17, Congressman [[Thomas L. Hamer]] nominated him for a position at the [[United States Military Academy]] (USMA) at [[West Point, New York]]. Hamer mistakenly wrote down the name as "Ulysses S. Grant of Ohio." At West Point, he adopted this name with a middle initial only. His nickname became "Sam" among army colleagues at the academy, since the initials "U.S." also stood for "Uncle Sam". The "S", according to Grant, did not stand for anything, though Hamer had used it to abbreviate his mother's maiden name.{{sfnm|McFeely 1981||1p=12|Smith||2pp=24, 83}} Grant's appointment to West Point was facilitated by his family's influence, while Grant himself later recalled "a military life had no charms for me".{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=16}} Grant stood 5 feet 1&nbsp;inches and weighed 117&nbsp;lbs when he entered West Point.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=13}}  Grant later said that he was lax in his studies, but he achieved above average grades in mathematics and geology.{{sfn|Smith|pp=26<U+2013>28}} Although Grant had a quiet nature, he established a few intimate friends at West Point, including [[Frederick Tracy Dent]] and [[Rufus Ingalls]].{{sfnm|McFeely 1981||1p=20|Longacre||2p=18}}   While not excelling scholastically, Grant studied under [[Romanticism|Romantic]] artist [[Robert Walter Weir]] and produced nine surviving artworks.{{sfn|Smith|pp=26<U+2013>28}} He also established a reputation as a fearless and expert horseman, setting an equestrian high-jump record that stood for almost 25 years.{{sfn|Smith|pp=26<U+2013>28}} He graduated in 1843, ranking 21st in a class of 39.  Grant was glad to leave West Point and planned to resign his commission after serving the minimum term of obligated duty.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=16, 19}}  Despite his excellent horsemanship, he was not assigned to the cavalry, as assignments were determined by class rank, not aptitude.{{sfn|Smith|pp=26<U+2013>28}}  Grant was instead assigned as a regimental quartermaster, managing supplies and equipment in the [[4th Infantry Regiment (United States)|4th Infantry Regiment]], with the rank of brevet [[second lieutenant]].{{sfnm|Smith||1pp=26<U+2013>28|Longacre||2p=24}}

==Military career, 1843<U+2013>1854==
Grant's first assignment after graduation took him to the [[Jefferson Barracks]] near [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in September 1843.{{sfn|Smith|pp=28<U+2013>29}} It was the nation's largest military bastion in the West, commanded by Colonel [[Stephen W. Kearny]].  Grant was happy with his new commander, but still looked forward to the end of his military service and a possible teaching career.{{sfn|Smith|pp=30<U+2013>33}}  Grant spent some of his time in Missouri visiting the family of his West Point classmate, Frederick Dent, and getting to know Dent's sister, [[Julia Boggs Dent|Julia]]; the two became secretly engaged in 1844.{{sfn|Smith|pp=30<U+2013>33}}

Rising tensions with Mexico saw Grant's unit shifted to Louisiana that year as a part of the [[Army of Observation]] under [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Zachary Taylor]].{{sfn|Smith|pp=35<U+2013>37}}  When the [[Mexican<U+2013>American War]] broke out in 1846, the Army entered Mexico.  Not content with his responsibilities as a quartermaster, Grant made his way to the front lines to engage in the battle, and participated as a ''de facto'' cavalryman at the [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma]].{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=32<U+2013>33}}  The army continued its advance into Mexico.  At [[Battle of Monterrey|Monterrey]], Grant demonstrated his equestrian ability, carrying a dispatch through sniper-lined streets on horseback while mounted in one stirrup.{{sfnm|Longacre||1pp=37<U+2013>42|Brands 2012a||2pp=34<U+2013>38}}  President [[James K. Polk]], wary of Taylor's growing popularity, divided his army, sending some troops (including Grant's unit) to form a new army under Major General [[Winfield Scott]].{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=34<U+2013>35}}  Scott's army landed at [[Veracruz]] and advanced toward [[Mexico City]].  The army met the Mexican forces at battles of [[Battle of Molino del Rey|Molino del Rey]] and [[Battle of Chapultepec|Chapultepec]] outside Mexico City.  At Chapultepec, Grant dragged a [[howitzer]] into a church steeple to bombard nearby Mexican troops.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=36<U+2013>37}}  Scott's army entered the city, and the Mexicans agreed to peace not long after.

In his memoirs, Grant later wrote that he had learned about military leadership by observing the decisions and actions of his commanding officers, and in retrospect he identified himself with Taylor's style.  At the time, he felt that the war was a wrongful one and believed that territorial gains were designed to spread slavery throughout the nation; writing in 1883, Grant said "I was bitterly opposed to the measure, and to this day, regard the war, which resulted, as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation." He also opined that the later Civil War was inflicted on the nation as punishment for its aggression in Mexico.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=31, 37}}

On August 22, 1848, Grant and Julia were married after a four-year engagement.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=20, 26}} In all, they had four children: [[Frederick Dent Grant|Frederick]], [[Ulysses S. Grant, Jr.|Ulysses Jr. ("Buck")]], [[Ellen Wrenshall Grant|Ellen ("Nellie")]], and [[Jesse Root Grant|Jesse]].{{sfn|Smith|p=73}}  Grant was assigned to several different posts over the ensuing six years. His first post-war assignments took him and Julia to [[Detroit]] and [[Sackets Harbor, New York]], the location that made them the happiest.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=44}}  In the spring of 1852, he traveled in to Washington, D.C., in a failed attempt to prevail upon the Congress to rescind an order that he, in his capacity as quartermaster, reimburse the military $1000 in losses incurred on his watch, for which he bore no personal guilt.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=46}}  He was sent west to [[Fort Vancouver]] in the [[Oregon Territory]] in 1852, initially landing in [[San Francisco]] during the height of the [[California Gold Rush]]. Julia could not accompany him as she was eight months pregnant with their second child.{{sfn|Smith|pp=76<U+2013>77}}  The journey proved to be an ordeal due to transportation disruptions and an outbreak of [[cholera]] within the entourage while traveling overland through Panama.  Grant made use of his organizational skills, arranging makeshift transportation and hospital facilities to take care of the sick; even so there were 150 fatalities.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=47}} After Grant arrived in San Francisco, he traveled to Fort Vancouver, continuing his service as quartermaster.

To supplement a military salary inadequate to support his family, Grant, assuming his work as quartermaster so equipped him, attempted but failed at several business ventures.{{sfn|Smith|pp=81<U+2013>82}} The business failures in the West confirmed Jesse Grant's belief that his son had no head for business, creating frustration for both father and son.  In one case, Grant had even naively allowed himself to be swindled by a partner.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=48<U+2013>49}} Grant grew unhappy at his financial troubles and the separation from his family, and rumors began to circulate that Grant was drinking to excess.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=48<U+2013>49}}

In the summer of 1853, Grant was promoted to [[Captain (U.S. Army)|captain]], one of only fifty on active duty, and assigned to command Company F, 4th Infantry, at [[Fort Humboldt State Historic Park|Fort Humboldt]], on the northwest California coast.  Without explanation, he shortly thereafter resigned from the army on July 31, 1854. The commanding officer at Fort Humboldt, brevet Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert C. Buchanan]], a strict disciplinarian, received reports that Grant was intoxicated off duty while seated at the pay officer's table.  In lieu of a court-martial, Buchanan gave Grant an ultimatum to sign a drafted resignation letter.  Grant resigned; the War Department stated on his record, "Nothing stands against his good name."{{sfn|Longacre|pp=55<U+2013>58}}  Rumors, however, persisted in the regular army of Grant's intemperance.  {{efn|According to biographer McFeely, historians overwhelmingly agree that his intemperance at the time was a fact, though there are no eyewitness reports extant.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=55}}}}  Years later, Grant said, "the vice of intemperance had not a little to do with my decision to resign."{{sfnm|Smith||1pp=87<U+2013>88|Lewis|2pp=328<U+2013>332}} Grant's father, again believing his son's only potential for success to be in the military, tried to get the Secretary of War, [[Jefferson Davis]], to rescind the resignation, to no avail.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=57}}

==Civilian life==
[[File:Hardscrabble.jpg|thumb|"Hardscrabble", the home Grant built in Missouri for his family]]
At age 32, with no civilian vocation, Grant struggled through seven financially lean years. His father, Jesse, initially offered Grant a position in the Galena, Illinois, branch of the tannery business, on condition that Julia and the children stay with her parents in Missouri or the Grants in Kentucky, for economic reasons. Ulysses and Julia were adamantly opposed to another separation and declined the offer.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=58<U+2013>60}}  In 1854, Grant farmed on his brother-in-law's property near St. Louis, using slaves owned by Julia's father, but it did not succeed.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=58<U+2013>60}}  Two years later, Grant and his family moved to a section of his father-in-law's farm and, to give his family a home, built a house he called "[[Grant's Farm|Hardscrabble]]".{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=58<U+2013>60}}  Julia hated the rustic house, which she described as an "unattractive cabin".{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=58<U+2013>60}} During this time, Grant also acquired a slave from Julia's father, a thirty-five-year-old man named William Jones.{{sfn|Smith|pp=94<U+2013>95}}  Having met with no success farming, the Grants left the farm when their fourth and final child was born in 1858.  Grant freed his slave in 1859 instead of selling him, at a time when slaves commanded a high price and Grant needed money badly.{{sfn|Smith|pp=94<U+2013>95}} For the next year, the family took a small house in St. Louis where Grant worked with Julia's cousin Harry Boggs, again without success, as a bill collector.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=64}} In 1860, Jesse offered him the job in his tannery in [[Galena, Illinois]], without condition, and Grant accepted. The leather shop, "Grant & Perkins", sold harnesses, saddles, and other leather goods, and purchased hides from farmers in the prosperous Galena area. He moved his family to [[Ulysses S. Grant Home|a house in Galena]] that year.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=65<U+2013>66}}

[[File:Engraving of Mrs. Julia Dent Grant in 1868.jpg|thumb|Julia Dent Grant in 1868]]Grant was not politically active and never endorsed any candidate before the Civil War.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=69}} His father-in-law was a prominent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in Missouri, a factor that helped derail Grant's bid to become county engineer in 1859, while his father was an outspoken [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in Galena.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=95}} In the 1856 election, Grant cast his first presidential vote for the Democrat, [[James Buchanan]], saying he was really voting against [[John C. Fr<U+00E9>mont]], the Republican.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=69}} In 1860, he favored the Democratic presidential candidate [[Stephen A. Douglas]] over [[Abraham Lincoln]], and Lincoln over the Southern Democrat, [[John C. Breckinridge]]. Lacking the residency requirements in Illinois at the time, he could not vote. By August 1863, after the fall of [[Vicksburg Campaign|Vicksburg]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Grant's political sympathies fully coincided with the [[Radical Republicans]]' aggressive prosecution of the war and promotion of the abolition of slavery.{{sfn|Catton 1968|p=8}}

==Civil War==
{{main|Ulysses S. Grant and the American Civil War}}
On April 12, 1861, the [[American Civil War]] began as Confederate troops attacked [[Fort Sumter]] in Charleston, South Carolina, forcing its surrender.  Two days later, Lincoln put out a call for 75,000 volunteers. A mass meeting was called in Galena to encourage recruitment.  Recognized as the sole military professional in the area, Grant was asked to lead the meeting and ensuing effort.  He proceeded to help recruit a company of volunteers and accompanied it to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], the capital of Illinois. Illinois Governor [[Richard Yates (19th century politician)|Richard Yates]] offered Grant a position recruiting and training volunteer units, which he accepted, but Grant wanted a field command in the regular Army.  He made multiple efforts with contacts (including Major General [[George B. McClellan]]) to acquire such a position with no success. Meanwhile, Grant continued serving at the training camps and made a positive impression on the volunteer Union recruits.  With the aid of his advocate in Washington, Illinois congressman [[Elihu B. Washburne]], Grant was promoted to Colonel by Governor Yates on June 14, 1861, and put in charge of the unruly [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]. Transferred to northern Missouri, Grant was promoted by President Lincoln to Brigadier General, supported again by Washburne, backdated to May 17, 1861.{{sfn|Smith|p=113}} By the end of August 1861, Major General [[John C. Fr<U+00E9>mont]] assigned Grant to the District of [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]] in southern Illinois.  Grant's  demeanor had changed at the outset of the war, renewing his energy and confidence.{{sfnm|McFeely 1981||1pp=73<U+2013>76, 80|Smith||2pp=107<U+2013>108}} He later recalled with apparent satisfaction that after that first recruitment meeting in Galena, 'I never went into our leather store again&nbsp;..."{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=73}} During this time, Grant quickly perceived that the war would be fought for the most part by volunteers and not professional soldiers.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=80}}

===Forts Henry and Donelson===
[[File:Fort Henry Campaign.png|thumb|Campaigns for Belmont, Fort Henry, and Fort Donelson]]
Grant's troops first saw action in late 1861 by striking from their base at Cairo, Illinois, the strategic point where the Ohio River flows into the Mississippi River, near the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=151}} The Confederate army was stationed in Columbus, Kentucky, under Major General [[Leonidas Polk]].  Fr<U+00E9>mont ordered Grant to make "demonstrations", not including an attack, against the Confederate Army at Belmont.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=151}} After Lincoln relieved Fr<U+00E9>mont from command, Grant attacked [[Battle of Belmont|Fort Belmont]] taking 3,114 Union troops by boat on November 7, 1861.  He initially took the fort, but his army was later pushed back to Cairo by the reinforced Confederates under Brigadier General [[Gideon J. Pillow]].  A tactical defeat, the battle nonetheless instilled much needed confidence in Grant and his volunteers.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=92<U+2013>94}} Following Belmont, Grant asked Major General [[Henry Halleck]] for permission to move against [[Battle of Fort Henry|Fort Henry]] on the Tennessee River; Halleck agreed on condition that the attack be conducted with oversight by Union Navy [[Flag Officer#United States|Flag Officer]] [[Andrew H. Foote]]. Grant's troops, in close cooperation with Foote's naval forces, successfully captured Fort Henry on February 6, 1862, and nearby [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]] on the Cumberland River on February 16.{{sfn|Smith|pp=141<U+2013>164}} Fort Henry, undermanned by Confederates and nearly submerged from flood waters, was taken over with few losses.{{sfn|Whyte|pp=18<U+2013>39}} However, at Fort Donelson, Grant and Foote encountered stiffer resistance from the Confederate forces under Pillow.  Grant's initial 15,000 troops were joined by 10,000 reinforcements against 12,000 Confederate troops at Fort Donelson. Foote's initial approach by Union naval ships were repulsed by Donelson's guns. The Confederates, who were surrounded by Grant's army, attempted a break out, pushing Grant's right flank into disorganized retreat eastward.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=164<U+2013>165}}  Grant rallied his troops, resumed the offensive, retook the Union right, and attacked Pillow's left.  Pillow ordered Confederate troops back into the fort and relinquished command to Brigadier General [[Simon Bolivar Buckner]], who surrendered to Grant the next day. Grant's terms were repeated across the North: "No terms except an unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted."{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=164<U+2013>165}}  Grant became a celebrity in the North, now nicknamed "Unconditional Surrender" Grant. With these victories, President Abraham Lincoln promoted Grant to major general of volunteers.{{sfn|Smith|pp=125<U+2013>34}}

===Shiloh===
Grant's advance at Forts Henry and Donelson was the most significant advance into the Confederacy the North had yet seen. His army, known as the [[Army of the Tennessee]], had increased to 48,894 men and was encamped on the western side of the Tennessee River. Grant met with Brigadier General [[William T. Sherman]], and they prepared to attack the Confederate stronghold of equal numbers at [[Corinth, Mississippi]].{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=111}} The Confederates prepared for the same attack, and moved first at dawn on April 6, 1862, with a full attack on the Union Army at the [[Battle of Shiloh]].  The objective was to annihilate the western Union offensive in one massive assault.  Over 44,000 Confederate troops, led by Generals [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] and [[P.G.T. Beauregard]], attacked the five divisions of Grant's army bivouacked nine miles south at Pittsburg Landing. Aware of the impending Confederate attack, Union troops sounded the alarm and readied for battle. The Confederates struck hard and pushed the Union Army back towards the Tennessee River. At the end of the day, the Union Army was vulnerable and might have been destroyed, had Beauregard's troops not been too exhausted to continue the fight.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=114}} Avoiding panic, Grant and Sherman rallied their troops for a counterattack the next morning. With reinforcement troops from Major General [[Don Carlos Buell]] and Major General [[Lew Wallace]]'s missing division, Grant succeeded in driving the Confederates back to the road from Corinth.  Although he stopped short of capturing Beauregard's army, Grant was able to stabilize the Army of the Tennessee.{{sfnm|McFeely 1981||1p=115|Smith||2pp=167<U+2013>205}}

The battle was the costliest of the war to date, with aggregate Union and Confederate casualties of 23,746, and minimal strategic advantage gained by either side. Nevertheless, Grant received high praise from many corners. He later remarked that the carnage at Shiloh had made it clear to him that the Confederacy would only be defeated by complete annihilation of its armies. Grant was criticized for his decision to keep the Union Army bivouacked rather than entrenched.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=186<U+2013>187}} Halleck transferred command of the Army of the Tennessee to Brigadier General [[George H. Thomas]] and promoted Grant to the hollow position of second-in-command of the western armies, removing him from an active field command.  As a result, Grant was again on the verge of resigning, until Sherman paid a visit to his camp.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=190<U+2013>192}}  Sherman, whose experiences in the military had been similar to Grant's, convinced Grant to remain in the army. During Halleck's sluggish advance on Corinth<U+2014>covering 19 miles in 30 days<U+2014>the entire Confederate force there escaped; the 120,000-man Union Army was then broken up. [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]], an investigative agent for Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]] at the time, interviewed Grant and related to Lincoln and Stanton that Grant appeared "self-possessed and eager to make war." Lincoln reinstated Grant to his command of the Army of the Tennessee.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=117<U+2013>21}}

===Vicksburg===
{{further|Western Theater of the American Civil War}}
[[File:Battle of Jackson (MS).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Jackson, Mississippi|Battle of Jackson]], fought on 14 May 1863, in Jackson, Mississippi, was part of the [[Vicksburg Campaign]].]]
Lincoln was determined to take the strategic Confederate stronghold at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], on the Mississippi River, and authorized Major General [[John A. McClernand]] to raise an army in his home state of Illinois for the purpose.  Grant was very frustrated at the lack of direction he was receiving to move forward from his station in Memphis, and more aggravated to learn of this apparent effort to brush him aside. According to biographer [[William S. McFeely]], this discontent may have been responsible for Grant's ill-considered issuance of [[General Order No. 11 (1862)|General Orders No. 11]] on December 17, 1862.  This order expelled Jews, as a class, from Grant's military district, in reaction to illicit activities of overly aggressive cotton traders in the Union camps, who Grant believed were interfering with military operations.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=123<U+2013>24}} Lincoln demanded the order be revoked, and Grant rescinded it twenty-one days after issuance. Without admitting fault, Grant believed he had only complied with the instructions sent from Washington. According to another Grant biographer, [[Jean Edward Smith|Jean E. Smith]], it was "one of the most blatant examples of state-sponsored [[anti-Semitism]] in American history."{{sfn|Smith|pp=225<U+2013>27}} Grant had believed that gold, along with cotton, was being smuggled through enemy lines and that Jews could pass freely into enemy camps.{{sfn|Longacre|pp=159<U+2013>61}} Grant later expressed regret for this order in 1868; his attitude concerning Jews was otherwise undeclared.{{sfn|Longacre|pp=159<U+2013>61}}

In December 1862, with Halleck's approval, Grant moved to take Vicksburg by an overland route, aided by [[Charles Smith Hamilton|Charles Hamilton]] and [[James B. McPherson|James McPherson]], in combination with a water expedition on the Mississippi led by Major General Sherman. Grant had thus pre-empted his rival McClernand's move. Confederate cavalry raiders Brigadier General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] and Major General [[Earl Van Dorn]] stalled Grant's advance by disrupting his communications, while the Confederate army led by Lieutenant General [[John C. Pemberton]] concentrated and repulsed Sherman's direct approach at [[Battle of Chickasaw Bayou|Chickasaw Bayou]]. McClernand afterwards attempted to salvage Sherman's effort to no avail, so at the end of the first day neither Grant nor McClernand had succeeded.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=125<U+2013>26}}

During the second attempt to capture Vicksburg, Grant made a series of unsuccessful movements along bayou and canal water routes. Finally, in April 1863, Grant marched Union troops down the west side of the Mississippi River and crossed east over at Bruinsburg using Rear Admiral [[David Dixon Porter|David Porter]]'s ships. Grant previously had ordered two diversion battles that confused Pemberton and allowed Grant's army to cross the Mississippi. After a series of battles, including the capture of a railroad junction near [[Battle of Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], Grant went on to defeat Pemberton at the [[Battle of Champion Hill]].  Grant then assaulted the Vicksburg fortress twice and suffered serious losses.  After the failed assault, Grant settled in for [[Siege of Vicksburg|a siege lasting seven weeks]].  As the siege began, Grant lapsed into a two-day drinking episode.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=132<U+2013>35}} Pemberton surrendered Vicksburg to Grant on July 4, 1863.{{sfnm|McFeely 1981||1pp=122<U+2013>138|Smith||2pp=206<U+2013>257}} During the campaign, Grant assumed responsibility for refugee-contraband slaves who were displaced by the war and were vulnerable to Confederate marauders; Lincoln had authorized their recruitment into the Union Army.  Grant put the refugees under the protection of Brigadier General [[John Eaton (general)|John Eaton]], who authorized them to work on abandoned Confederate plantations to support the war effort.

The fall of Vicksburg gave the Union control over the entire Mississippi and split the Confederacy in two.  Grant demonstrated that an indirect assault, coupled with diversionary tactics, was a highly effective strategy in defeating an entrenched army.  Although the success at Vicksburg was a great morale boost for the Union war effort, Grant received much criticism for his decisions and his reported drunkenness. Lincoln again sent Dana to keep a watchful eye on Grant's alleged intemperance; Dana eventually became Grant's devoted ally, and made light of the drinking.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=128, 135}} The personal rivalry between McClernand and Grant continued over Vicksburg, but ended when Grant removed McClernand from command after he issued, and arranged the publication of, a military order in contravention of Grant.

===Chattanooga and promotion===
[[File:Battle of Missionary Ridge McCormick Harvesting.jpg|thumb|Union troops swarm [[Battle of Missionary Ridge|Missionary Ridge]] and defeat Bragg's army.]]
Lincoln put Grant in command of the newly formed [[Military Division of the Mississippi|Division of the Mississippi]] in October 1863, giving Grant charge of the entire western theater of war except for Louisiana.  After the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]] forced Major General [[William Rosecrans]]'s Army of the Cumberland to retreat into Chattanooga (a central railway hub), surrounded the city, and trapped the Union army inside. Only Major General [[George H. Thomas]] and the XIV Corps kept the Army of the Cumberland from complete defeat at the Battle of Chickamauga. When informed of the ominous situation at Chattanooga, Grant relieved Rosecrans from duty and placed Thomas in charge of the besieged [[Army of the Cumberland]]. To stop the siege and go on the attack, Grant personally rode out to Chattanooga and took charge of the desperate situation. Lincoln sent Major General [[Joseph Hooker]] and two divisions of the Army of the Potomac to reinforce the Army of the Cumberland, but Confederate forces kept the two armies from meeting. Grant's first action was to open up a supply line to the Army of the Cumberland trapped in Chattanooga. Following a plan devised by Major General [[William Farrar Smith|William F. Smith]], a "Cracker Line" was formed, with Hooker's Army of the Potomac on Lookout Mountain and supplied the Army of the Cumberland with food and weapons.{{sfnm|McFeely 1981||1pp=139<U+2013>51|Smith||2pp=262<U+2013>71}}

On November 23, 1863, Grant organized three armies to attack Bragg's troops on [[Battle of Missionary Ridge|Missionary Ridge]] and [[Battle of Lookout Mountain|Lookout Mountain]]. The next day, Sherman and four divisions of the Army of the Tennessee assaulted Bragg's right flank. Thomas and the Army of the Cumberland overtook Confederate picket trenches at the base of Missionary Ridge. Hooker's forces took Lookout Mountain and captured 1,064 prisoners.  On November 25, Sherman continued his attack on Bragg's right flank on the northern section of Missionary Ridge. In response to Sherman's assault, Bragg withdrew Confederate troops on the main ridge to reinforce the Confederate right flank. Seeing that Bragg was reinforcing his right flank, Grant ordered Thomas to make a general assault on Missionary Ridge. After a brief delay, the Army of the Cumberland, led by Major General [[Philip Sheridan]] and Brigadier General [[Thomas J. Wood]], captured the first Confederate entrenchments. Without further orders, the Army of the Cumberland continued uphill and captured the Confederate's secondary entrenchments on top of Missionary Ridge, forcing the defeated Confederates into disorganized retreat.  Although Bragg's army had not been captured, the decisive battle opened [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and the heartland of the Confederacy to Union invasion.  Grant's fame increased, and he was promoted to [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]], a position that had previously been given only to George Washington and  Winfield Scott.{{sfn|Smith|pp=258<U+2013>281}}

[[File:GenUSGrant.jpg|thumb |left |[[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] Ulysses S. Grant]]
Disappointed with Major General [[George Meade]]'s failure to pursue Lee after the Confederate defeat at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies in March 1864.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=148}} Grant gave the Department of the Mississippi to Sherman, and went east to Washington, D.C., to devise a strategy with Lincoln. After settling Julia into a house in Georgetown, Grant established his headquarters fifty miles away, near Meade's Army of the Potomac in Culpeper, Virginia.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=156}} The Union strategy of a comprehensive effort to bring about a speedy victory consisted of coordinated Union offensives, attacking the rebel armies at the same time to keep the Confederates from shifting reinforcements within southern interior lines.  Sherman would attack [[Battle of Atlanta|Atlanta]] and Georgia, while Meade would lead the Army of the Potomac, with Grant in camp, to attack [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. Major General [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] was to attack and advance towards Richmond from the south, going up the [[James River]].{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=157}} Depending on Lee's actions, Grant would join forces with Butler's armies and be fed supplies from the James River. Major General [[Franz Sigel]] was to capture the railroad line at [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]], move east, and attack from the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]].{{sfnm|McFeely 1981||1pp=157<U+2013>175|Smith||2pp=313<U+2013>39, 343<U+2013>68}} Grant was riding a rising tide of popularity, and there were discussions in some corners that a Union victory early in the year could open the possibility of his candidacy for the presidency. Grant was aware of it, but had ruled it out in discussions with Lincoln; in any case, the possibility would soon vanish with delays on the battlefield.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=162<U+2013>63}}

===Overland Campaign and victory===
Sigel's and Butler's efforts sputtered, and Grant was left alone to fight Lee in a series of bloody battles of attrition known as the [[Overland Campaign]]. After taking the month of April 1864 to assemble and ready the Army of the Potomac, Grant crossed the [[Rapidan River]] on May 4 and attacked Lee in the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]], a hard-fought three-day battle with many casualties. Rather than retreat as his predecessors had done, Grant flanked Lee's army to the southeast and attempted to wedge the Union Army between Lee and Richmond at Spotsylvania.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=165}} Lee's army got to [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania]] first, and a costly battle began that lasted thirteen days. During the battle, Grant attempted to break through Lee's line of defense at the Mule Shoe, which resulted in one of the bloodiest assaults during the Civil War, known as [[Battle of the Bloody Angle|The Battle of the Bloody Angle]]. Unable to break Lee's line of defense after repeated attempts, Grant flanked Lee to the southeast east again at [[Battle of North Anna|North Anna]], a battle that lasted three days.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=169}} This time the Confederate Army had a superior defensive advantage on Grant. Grant then maneuvered the Union Army to [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]], a vital railroad hub that was linked to Richmond, but Lee's men were able to entrench against the Union assault. During the third day of the thirteen-day battle, Grant led a costly assault on Lee's trenches. As news spread in the North, heavy criticism fell on Grant, who was called "the Butcher", having taken 52,788 casualties in thirty days since crossing the Rapidan.{{sfn|Bonekemper 2011|pp=41<U+2013>42}} Lee suffered 32,907 Confederate casualties, and was less able to replace them.{{sfn|Bonekemper 2011|pp=41<U+2013>42}}  When the two armies had fought to a stalemate, the generals took three days to reach a truce, so that the dead and dying could be removed from the battlefield.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=171}} The costly June 3 assault at Cold Harbor was the second of two battles in the war which Grant later distinctly regretted.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=173}} Unknown to Lee, Grant pulled out of Cold Harbor and moved his army south of the James River, freed Major General Butler from [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign|the Bermuda Hundred]], and attacked Petersburg, Richmond's central railroad hub.{{sfnm|McFeely 1981||1pp=157<U+2013>175|Smith||2pp=313<U+2013>39, 343<U+2013>68}}

}}
After Grant and the Army of the Potomac had crossed the James River undetected and rescued Butler's army from the Bermuda Hundred, Grant advanced the army southward [[Battle of Petersburg|to capture Petersburg]]. Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard, in charge of Petersburg, was able to defend the city, and Lee's veteran reinforcements arrived. Grant forced Lee into a long nine-month siege of Petersburg, and the war effort stalled.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=178}} Northern resentment grew as the war dragged on, but an indirect benefit of the Petersburg siege was found in preventing Lee from reinforcing armies to oppose Sherman and Sheridan.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=186}} During the siege, Sherman was able to take Atlanta, a victory that advanced President Lincoln's reelection. Major General Sheridan was given command of the [[Union Army of the Shenandoah]] and was directed to "follow the enemy to their death".{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=181}} Lee had sent General [[Jubal Early]] up the Shenandoah Valley to attack the federal capital and draw troops away from the Army of the Potomac, but Sheridan defeated Early, saving Washington from capture.  Grant then ordered Sheridan's cavalry to destroy vital Confederate supply farms in the Shenandoah Valley. When Sheridan reported suffering attacks by irregular Confederate cavalry under [[John S. Mosby]], Grant recommended rounding up their families for imprisonment as hostages at Ft. McHenry.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=181}}

Grant attempted to blow up part of Lee's Petersburg trenches from an underground tunnel, but the explosion created a crater from which Confederates could easily pick off Union troops below. The 3500 Union casualties outnumbered the Confederates' by three-to-one; Grant admitted the tactic had been a "stupendous failure."{{sfnm|McFeely 1981||1p=179|Smith||2pp=369<U+2013>95}} On August 9, 1864, Grant, who had just arrived at his headquarters in [[City Point, Virginia|City Point]], narrowly escaped death when Confederate spies blew up an ammunition barge moored below the city's bluffs.{{sfn|Catton 1968|p=349}} As the war slowly progressed, Grant continued to extend Lee's entrenchment defenses southwest of Petersburg, in an effort to capture vital railroad links. By August 21, the Union had captured the [[Wilmington and Weldon Railroad]].  As Grant continued to push the Union advance westward towards the [[Southside Railroad (Virginia)|South Side Railroad]], Lee's entrenchment lines became overstretched and undermanned.  After the Federal army rebuilt the [[City Point Railroad]], Grant was able to use mortars to attack Lee's entrenchments.

Once Sherman reached the East Coast and Thomas dispatched Hood in Tennessee, Union victory appeared certain, and Lincoln resolved to attempt a negotiated end to the war with the Confederates. He enlisted [[Francis Preston Blair]] to carry a message to Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]]. Davis and Lincoln each appointed commissioners, but the conference soon stalled. Grant contacted Lincoln, who agreed to personally meet with the commissioners at [[Fort Monroe]].  The peace conference was ultimately fruitless, but Grant had shown his willingness and ability to assume a diplomatic role beyond his normal military posture.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=198<U+2013>210}}

In March 1865, while Lincoln met at City Point with Grant, Sherman, and Porter, Union forces finally took Petersburg and captured Richmond in April. Lee's troops began deserting in large numbers; disease and lack of supplies also weakened Lee's forces.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=212}}  Lee attempted to link up with the remnants of Confederate General [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s defeated army, but Union cavalry forces led by Sheridan were able to stop the two armies from converging. Lee and his army surrendered to Grant at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Court House]] on April 9, 1865.  Grant gave generous terms; Confederate troops surrendered their weapons and were allowed to return to their homes with their mounts, on the condition that they would not take up arms against the United States. Within a few weeks, the Civil War was over.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=219<U+2013>20}}

===Lincoln's assassination===
{{main|Assassination of Abraham Lincoln}}
On April 14, five days after Grant's victory at Appomattox, Lincoln was fatally shot by [[John Wilkes Booth]] and died the next morning. The assassination was part of a conspiracy that targeted a number of government leaders.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=224}} Grant attended a cabinet meeting that day, and Lincoln had invited Grant and his wife to the theater, but they declined as they had plans to travel to Philadelphia. Many, including Grant himself, thought that Grant had been a target in the plot.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=375<U+2013>376}} Secretary of War Stanton, through Charles Dana, notified Grant of the President's death and summoned him to Washington. The following day, Grant hastily ordered the arrest of paroled Confederate officers. Major General [[Edward Ord]], however, was able to narrow the existing threats in Washington through the use of [[Military intelligence|army intelligence]] and persuaded Grant to reverse his arrest orders.{{sfn|McFeely 1981| p=225}} Attending Lincoln's funeral on April 19, Grant stood alone and wept openly. He said of Lincoln, "He was incontestably the greatest man I have ever known."{{sfn|Smith|pp=409<U+2013>412}} Regarding the new President, [[Andrew Johnson]], Grant commented to Julia that he dreaded the change in administrations; he judged Johnson's attitude toward white southerners as one that would "make them unwilling citizens", and initially thought that with Johnson, "Reconstruction has been set back no telling how far."{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=227<U+2013>229}}

Later in April, Sherman, without consulting Washington, concluded an agreement with Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston to effect the latter's surrender, believing it to be consistent with Lincoln's recent statements to him at City Point.  Stanton and Grant quickly surmised the terms were much too lenient. Stanton even declared so publicly with scorn for Sherman; Grant, concerned that his lead commander's mistake not be mishandled, requested a cabinet meeting to discuss the problem, and offered to personally deliver the message of repudiation to Sherman. Grant handled the matter adroitly and made the most of their friendship, conveying the message to Sherman and ultimately getting his consent to renegotiate the agreement in accordance with the terms at Appomattox.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=227<U+2013>229}}

[[File:USGrantHomeGalena.jpg|thumb|alt=Two-story brick house where Grant lived in Galena.|The post-Civil War [[Ulysses S. Grant Home|home]] of Ulysses S. Grant, in [[Galena, Illinois]]]]
In May 1865, the [[Union League of Philadelphia]] purchased a house for the Grants in that city, but Grant's military work was in Washington. He attempted to commute for a time and return on the weekends, but he and Julia moved to Washington that October.{{sfn|Smith|p=419}}  They secured a place in Georgetown Heights, while Grant instructed Elihu Washburne that for political purposes his legal residence remained in Galena, Illinois.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=232<U+2013>33}} That year, Grant appeared at [[Cooper Union]] in New York where, as the ''New York Times'' described, "...&nbsp;the enhanced and bewildered multitude trembled with extraordinary delight."{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=234}} Further travels that summer with repeated enthusiastic receptions took the Grants to Albany, back to Galena, and throughout Illinois and Ohio.  On July 25, 1866, Congress promoted Grant to the newly created rank of [[General of the Army of the United States]].{{sfn|Smith|p=434n}}

Grant was the most popular man in the country.{{sfn|Smith|pp=369<U+2013>397}}  When President Johnson argued with Congress over Reconstruction, he took his case to the people with his "swing around the circle." Johnson sought to capitalize on Grant's popularity by having the general travel with him.{{sfn|Smith|pp=369<U+2013>397}}  Grant, wishing to appear loyal, agreed to accompany Johnson; however he confided in his wife that he thought Johnson's speeches were a "national disgrace". Grant continued his efforts to appear loyal while not alienating Republican legislators essential to his future.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=242<U+2013>251}} At the same time, Johnson also suspected Grant to be a potential candidate in the [[United States presidential election, 1868|1868 presidential election]], and decided to replace Secretary of War Stanton with Grant or Sherman. Grant discussed the matter with Sherman and convinced him to avoid the politically troubled president.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=242<U+2013>251}}

{{main|Reconstruction Era of the United States}}
After the speaking tour, Johnson sent Grant on a fact-finding mission to the South. Afterwards, Grant filed a report recommending continuation of a reformed [[Freedman's Bureau]], which Johnson opposed, but advising against the use of black troops in garrisons that he believed were encouraging an alternative to farm labor.{{sfnm|Brands 2012a||1p=390|Smith||2p=420|McFeely 1981||3pp=238<U+2013>241}} Grant did not believe the people of the devastated South were ready for self-rule, and thought they required further U.S. military occupation.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=390}} Grant stated that both whites and blacks in the South required the protection of the U.S. federal government.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=390}} Grant also warned of threats by disaffected poor people, black and white, and recommended that local decision-making be entrusted only to "thinking men of the South" (''i.e.,'' men of property).{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=238, 240}} In this respect, Grant's initial Reconstruction policy aligned with Johnson's policy of pardoning established southern leaders and restoring them to their positions of power.{{sfnm|McFeely 1981||1p=240|Smith||2p=420}} He joined Johnson in arguing that Congress should allow representatives from the South to be seated.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=240<U+2013>241}}

In 1866, an intraparty fight arose in Maryland that threatened to devolve into a riot. John Lee Chapman, the Radical mayor of Baltimore, had been elected in 1862 in an election in which conservative voters claimed the police commissioners had turned them away from the polls.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=254<U+2013>256}}  Four years later, Maryland's governor, [[Thomas Swann]], a Johnson supporter, threatened to remove the commissioners and appoint his own, which Radicals believed would result in their own disenfranchisement.  Grant was reluctant to send federal troops into a loyal state; instead he traveled to the city himself as a private citizen and arranged a settlement that would allow both groups' poll watchers to ensure fair elections.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=254<U+2013>256}}

The Baltimore tumult was just the prelude to the conflict between Radicals and Conservatives over the Reconstruction of the South.  Rejecting Johnson's vision for quick reconciliation with former Confederates, Congress passed the [[Reconstruction Acts]] which divided the southern states into five military districts run by the army to ensure that freedmen's constitutional and congressional rights were protected.  Transitional state governments in each district were to be led by military governors general. Grant, who was to select the general to govern each district, preferred Congress's plan for enforcement of Reconstruction.{{sfn|Smith|pp=432<U+2013>433}}  Grant was optimistic Reconstruction Acts would help pacify the South.{{sfn|Smith|pp=434<U+2013>435}}  He carried out his duty under the Acts and instructed the generals to do likewise, further alienating Johnson; when Sheridan removed public officials in Louisiana who impeded Reconstruction, Johnson was especially displeased and sought Sheridan's removal.{{sfn|Smith|pp=436<U+2013>439}} Grant stayed the middle course and recommended a rebuke, but not a dismissal.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=259<U+2013>261}} Throughout the Reconstruction period, more than 1,500 [[List of African-American officeholders during the Reconstruction|African Americans were elected to political office]], while Grant and the military protected their rights by overturning the first [[Black Codes (United States)|black codes]] in 1867.{{sfn|Smith|pp=421, 433}}

===Mexico and Canada===
Grant, as commanding general, immediately had to contend with [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Mexico]] and the French army that had taken over Mexico with the help of [[Napoleon III]]. Most Americans felt this to be a violation of the [[Monroe Doctrine]].  Johnson told Grant to put military pressure on the French to leave Mexico by sending 50,000 troops to the Texas border under Sheridan. Grant told Sheridan to do whatever he could, within the bounds of neutrality, to force Maximilian's abdicatation and convince the French Army to leave Mexico. Sheridan sent 60,000 rifles to [[Benito Ju<U+00E1>rez]], the ousted leader of Mexico.{{sfn|Smith|p=421n}} In a cabinet meeting, Johnson suggested Grant be assigned to the Mexican frontier as a way of removing him from the political mainstream. Grant immediately recognized the nature of this proposal and refused.  As a compromise, Grant sent Sherman (now promoted to Lieutenant General) in his place.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=257}}  By 1866, the French Army completely withdrew from Mexico; Maximilian was executed by Ju<U+00E1>rez in 1867.{{sfn|Smith|p=415}}

After the Civil War, thousands of [[Irish Brigade (U.S.)|Irish veterans]] joined the [[Fenian Brotherhood]] with the intention of invading and holding Canada hostage in exchange for Irish independence.  In June 1866, Johnson sent Grant to Buffalo, New York, to assess the situation. He ordered the Canadian border closed to prevent Fenian soldiers from crossing over at [[Fort Erie]] and that more weapons be confiscated. In June 1866, the United States Army arrested 700 Fenian troops at Buffalo, and the Fenians gave up on their attempt to invade Canada.{{sfnm|Smith||1pp=508<U+2013>509|Hesseltine||2pp=229<U+2013>230}}

===Johnson's impeachment===
[[Image:Senate-Johnson-Impeachment-Trials.jpg|thumb|The impeachment of Andrew Johnson]]
President Johnson had for some time wished to replace Secretary of War Stanton, who sympathized with Congressional Reconstruction. Johnson asked Grant to take the post in an effort to keep Grant under his control as a potential political rival.  Grant's reply was a recommendation against the move, in light of the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]], which required Senate approval of any removal of a cabinet appointment. Johnson forced the issue by making it an interim appointment during a Senate recess. Grant relented and agreed to accept the post temporarily, lest he be rendered politically irrelevant.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=262<U+2013>64}} 

Later, when the Senate reinstated Stanton, Johnson requested that Grant refuse to surrender the office to Stanton and let the courts resolve the matter. Instead, Grant stepped aside and incurred Johnson's wrath during a cabinet meeting immediately afterwards for allegedly breaking a promise not to do so.  Grant disputed that he had ever made such a promise.{{sfn|Smith|pp=448<U+2013>451}} Johnson's true frustration was with Grant's taking the Radicals' side. On January 14, 1868, newspapers friendly to Johnson published a series of articles in an attempt to discredit Grant over returning the War Department to Stanton, stating Grant had been deceptive in the matter.{{sfn|Smith|pp=448<U+2013>451}} Grant defended himself in a written response to the President, which became public; Grant thereby increased his national popularity and emerged from the controversy unscathed.{{sfn|Smith|pp=448<U+2013>451}} He also took no role in the subsequent [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeachment proceedings against Johnson]] which, in part, centered on Johnson's removal of Stanton. In contrast, none of the principals in the impeachment matter benefited from it.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=275}}

==1868 presidential campaign==
{{main|United States presidential election, 1868}}

Grant entered the 1868 campaign season with increased popularity among the Radical Republicans following his abandonment of Johnson.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=264<U+2013>267}}  Grant was chosen as the Republican presidential candidate on the first ballot at the [[1868 Republican National Convention]] in Chicago, he faced no significant opposition.  In his letter of acceptance to the party, Grant concluded with "Let us have peace," which became his campaign slogan.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=264<U+2013>267}}  For vice president, the delegates nominated House Speaker [[Schuyler Colfax]]. Grant's [[General Order No. 11 (1862)|General Orders No. 11]] and antisemitism became an issue during the 1868 [[U.S. presidential election, 1868|presidential campaign]]. Grant sought to distance himself from the order, saying "I have no prejudice against sect or race, but want each individual to be judged by his own merit."{{sfn|Smith|pp=459<U+2013>460}}  As was common practice at the time, Grant remained at home in Galena during the campaign, and left most of the active campaigning and speaking on his behalf to his campaign manager [[William E. Chandler]] and others.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=282<U+2013>284}}

The Democrats nominated former New York Governor [[Horatio Seymour]].  The Democrats' campaign focused mainly on ending Reconstruction and returning control of the South to the white planter class, which alienated many [[War Democrats]] in the North.{{sfn|Smith|pp=468<U+2013>469}}  The Democrats attacked Reconstruction and the Republican Party's support of African American rights, while Grant was called captain of the "Black Marines".{{sfn|McFeely|pages=278, 283}} While courting black votes in Illinois, Grant was slapped in the face with a hat by a white supremacist.{{sfn|McFeely|page=278}} In the [[United States presidential election, 1868|general election of that year]], Grant won by 300,000 votes out of 5,716,082 votes cast. Grant received an [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]] landslide, getting 214 votes to Seymour's 80. When he assumed the presidency, Grant had never before held elected office and, at the age of forty-six, was the youngest person elected president to date.  Grant was the first president elected after the nation had outlawed slavery and given citizenship to former slaves. Implementation of these new rights was slow to come; in the 1868 election, the black vote counted in only sixteen of the thirty-seven states.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=284}}

==Presidency 1869<U+2013>1877==
{{Main|Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant}}
[[File:President Ulysses S. Grant seated portrait Brady.jpg|thumb |left |President Ulysses S. Grant <br /> ''Brady 1869'']]
Grant's presidency began with a break from tradition, as Johnson declined to ride in Grant's carriage or attend the inauguration at the Capitol.  In his Inaugural Address, Grant advocated the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment and said he would approach Reconstruction "calmly, without prejudice, hate or sectional pride."{{sfn|Patrick|p=166}} Grant took an unorthodox approach to his cabinet choices, declining to consult with the Senate and keeping his choices secret until he submitted them for confirmation. {{sfnm|McFeely 1981||1p=286|Smith||2pp=465<U+2013>66}} Grant purposely avoided choosing Republican Party leaders in an effort to create national harmony.{{sfn|Simon 2002|p=247}} Out of personal loyalty, Grant appointed his friends Elihu B. Washburne to the State Department and [[John A. Rawlins]] as Secretary of War. Washburne served only twelve days before resigning over claims of ill-health; the plan was designed to give him greater diplomatic clout when Grant appointed him Minister to France.{{sfnm|Smith||1pp=470<U+2013>471|Simon 2002||2p=247|Brands 2012a||3p=432}} Grant then appointed [[Hamilton Fish]], a conservative New York statesman, as Secretary of State. Fish would be Grant's most successful appointment.{{sfn|Simon 2002|p=247}} His relationship with Fish grew out of a strong friendship between the two men's wives.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=296}} Rawlins later died of [[tuberculosis]] and was replaced by [[William W. Belknap]].{{sfn|Simon 2002|pp=246<U+2013>247}}  Grant selected several non-politicians to his cabinet, including [[Adolph E. Borie]] and [[A.T. Stewart]], with limited success. Borie served briefly as Secretary of Navy, replaced by [[George M. Robeson]], while Stewart was lawfully prevented from becoming Secretary of Treasury by a 1789 statute and by Senator [[Charles Sumner]]'s and Senator [[Roscoe Conkling]]'s opposition to amend the law.{{sfn|Smith|pp=470<U+2013>472}} In place of Stewart, Grant appointed [[George S. Boutwell]], known for his integrity, as Secretary of Treasury.{{sfn|Smith|pp=470<U+2013>472}} Grant's other cabinet appointments<U+2014>[[Jacob D. Cox]] (Interior), [[John Creswell]] (Postmaster General), and [[Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar]] (Attorney General)<U+2014>were well-received and uncontroversial.{{sfn|Smith|pp=469<U+2013>470}}  To break from Washington, in 1869, Grant's family, at the invitation of wealthy backers, vacationed for the first time in what became known as the "summer capital" and "the resort of presidents", [[Long Branch, New Jersey]], where Grant returned often throughout his life.{{sfn|Perry|pp=53<U+2013>54}}

===Later Reconstruction and civil rights===
[[File:Harpers1874LouisianaOutrage.jpg|thumb|White Leaguers attacking the integrated police force and state militia, New Orleans, 1874]]
Reconstruction of the South continued as Grant took office in 1869. By 1870, the four remaining former Confederate states were successfully restored into the United States.{{sfn|Badeau|p=256}}  He lobbied Congress to pass the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]], guaranteeing that no state could prevent someone from voting based on race, and believed that its passage would secure freedmen's rights.{{sfn|Smith|p=543}}  To enforce the new amendment, Grant relied on the army and the newly created [[United States Justice Department|Justice Department]].  In 1870, Grant signed a bill proposed by [[Thomas Jenckes]] of Rhode Island establishing the Department of Justice, to see that federal laws were enforced in the South when state courts and prosecutors were reluctant to do so.  Where the attorney general had once been only a legal adviser to the president, he now led a cabinet department dedicated to enforcing federal law, including a [[Solicitor General of the United States|solicitor general]] to assist him.{{sfn|Smith|pp=544<U+2013>545}}  Under Grant's first attorney general, [[Ebenezer R. Hoar]], the administratation was not especially aggressive in prosecuting white Southerners who terrorized their black neighbors, but Hoar's successor, [[Amos T. Akerman]], was more zealous.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=368<U+2013>369}}  Alarmed by this rise in terror by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other groups, Congress investigated.  With Grant's encouragement, they passed the [[Enforcement Acts]] in 1870 and 1871.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=368<U+2013>369}}  The Acts made it a federal offense to deprive any person of his civil rights and allowed the president to use the army to enforce the laws.{{sfn|Smith|pp=544<U+2013>545}}  In May 1871, Grant ordered federal troops to assist [[United States Marshals Service|marshals]] in arresting Klansmen.{{sfn|Smith|p=547}}  That October, on Akerman's recommendation, Grant suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in part of South Carolina and sent federal troops to enforce the law there.{{sfn|Smith|p=547}}  The Klan's power collapsed, and by 1872, elections in the South saw African Americans voting in record numbers.{{sfn|Smith|p=547}}

That same year, Grant signed the [[Amnesty Act]], which restored political rights to former Confederates.  Growing scandals in Washington, some involving members of Grant's administration, took more of the public's attention than the plight of freedmen.  After the collapse of the Klan in 1872, conservative whites formed armed groups such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] in South Carolina and the [[White League]]. Unlike the Ku Klux Klan, they were not secret. They used violence and intimidation against African Americans in order to take control from state governments away from Republicans.{{sfn|Rable|pp=144<U+2013>86}}  Grant replaced Akerman with [[George Henry Williams]], who was later embroiled in his own scandal.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=391<U+2013>392}}  The [[Panic of 1873]] and the ensuing depression contributed to public fatigue, and the North grew less concerned with reconstructing the South.{{sfn|Smith|pp=552<U+2013>553}}  Grant began to favor a more limited use of troops, lest they create the impression that he was acting as a military dictator; he was also concerned that increased military pressure in the South might cause white supremacists in the North to bolt from the Republican Party.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=420<U+2013>22}}  By 1875, Democratic "[[Redeemers|Redeemer]]" politicians retook control of all but three Southern states.  As violence against black Southerners escalated once more, [[Edwards Pierrepont]] (Grant's fourth attorney general) told Governor [[Adelbert Ames]] of Mississippi that the people were "tired of the autumnal outbreaks in the South," and declined to intervene.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=420<U+2013>22}}  Grant signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]], which expanded federal law enforcement by prohibiting discrimination on account of race in [[public accommodations]], [[public transport]]ation, and [[Jury selection in the United States|jury service]].{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=418<U+2013>19}} The law was rarely enforced, however, and it did not stop the rise of white supremacist forces in the South.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=418<U+2013>19}} In the [[United States presidential election, 1876|election of 1876]], the remaining three Republican governments in the South fell to Redeemers, and the ensuing [[Compromise of 1877]] marked the end of Reconstruction.{{sfn|Badeau 1887|p=256}}

===Indian policy===
[[File:Ely S. Parker.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Ely S. Parker]], appointed by Grant, was the first Native American to serve as [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Commissioner of Indian Affairs]].]]

Grant's attempts to provide justice to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] marked a radical reversal of what had long been the government's policy of [[Indian removal]]. He appointed [[Ely S. Parker]], a [[Seneca people|Seneca]] Indian and member of Grant's wartime staff, as [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Commissioner of Indian Affairs]].  "My efforts in the future will be directed," Grant said in his second inaugural address, "by a humane course, to bring the aborigines of the country under the benign influences of education and civilization&nbsp;... Wars of extermination&nbsp;... are demoralizing and wicked."  Grant's "Peace Policy" (also called the "Quaker Policy") aimed to replace entrepreneurs serving as Indian agents with missionaries.{{sfnm|McFeely 1981||1pp=308<U+2013>309|Brands 2012a||2p=502}} In 1869, Grant signed an appropriations bill that established a Board of Indian Commissioners to oversee spending and reduce corruption in the Bureau of Indian Affairs.{{sfn|Smith|p=535}} Two years later, in 1871, Grant signed a bill ending the Indian treaty system; the law now treated individual Native Americans as wards of the federal government, rather than dealing with the tribes as sovereign entities.{{sfn|Waltmann|p=327}}  Grant wished the tribes to be protected on reservations and educated in European-style farming and culture, abandoning their hunter-gatherer way of life.{{sfnm|McFeely 1981||1pp=308<U+2013>309|Brands 2012a||2p=502}}  While unpopular today, the Peace Policy was considered liberal-minded in its day, and would see its fulfillment years later in the [[Dawes Act]] of 1887.  The Policy showed some success in reducing conflict with fewer battles between Indians and whites on the western frontier, but the increased slaughter of the buffalo, encouraged by Grant's subordinates, caused renewed conflict with the [[Plains Indians]] in a few years.{{sfnm|Smith||1pp=536<U+2013>38|Brands 2012a||2pp=501<U+2013>503}} The [[Sioux]] and other Plains tribes accepted the reservation system, but encroachments by whites in search of [[Black Hills Gold Rush|gold in the Black Hills]] led to [[Great Sioux War of 1876|renewed war]] by the end of Grant's second term.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=501}} The war ended the growing understanding that had developed between Grant and Sioux Chief [[Red Cloud]].{{sfnm|Brands 2012a||1pp=501<U+2013>503|McFeely 1981||2pp=436<U+2013>437}}

Under Major Generals [[Oliver Otis Howard]] and [[George Crook]], Grant's policy had greater success in the Southwest.  Howard, the former head of the Freedman's Bureau, negotiated peace with the [[Apache]] in 1872, convincing their leader, [[Cochise]], to move the tribe to a new reservation, and ending [[Apache Wars|a war]] started the year before.{{sfn|Smith|p=532}}  In Oregon, relations were less peaceful, however, as [[Modoc War|war with the Modocs]] erupted in April 1873.  The [[Modoc people|Modocs]] refused to move to a reservation and killed the local army commander, Major General [[Edward Canby]].{{sfn|Smith|p=535}}  Although Grant was upset over Canby's death, he ordered restraint, disregarding Sherman's advice to seek revenge or exterminate the tribe.{{sfn|Smith|p=535}} Four Modoc warriors were captured, tried for Canby's murder, sentenced to death, and hanged in October 1873.  The remainder of the tribe was sent to [[Indian Territory]].{{sfn|Smith|p=535}}

During the Great Sioux War, Grant came into conflict with Colonel [[George Armstrong Custer]] after Custer testified in 1876 about corruption in the War Department under Secretary [[William W. Belknap]].{{sfn|Donovan|pp=110<U+2013>111}} Grant had Custer arrested for breach of military protocol in Chicago and barred him from leading an upcoming campaign against the Sioux.{{sfn|Donovan|p=112}} Grant finally relented and let Custer fight under Brigadier General [[Alfred Terry]].{{sfn|Donovan|p=115}}  Custer was killed at the subsequent [[Battle of the Little Big Horn]], a defeat for the federal army.{{sfn|Donovan|pp=308, 310}}  Two months later, Grant castigated Custer in the press, saying "I regard Custer's massacre as a sacrifice of troops, brought on by Custer himself, that was wholly unnecessary <U+2013> wholly unnecessary."{{sfn|Donovan|pp=322<U+2013>323}} As the nation was shocked by the death of Custer, the Peace Policy yielded to militarism; Congress appropriated funds for 2,500 more troops, two more forts were constructed, and the army took over the Indian agencies, while Indians were barred from purchasing rifles and ammunition.{{sfn|Donovan|pp=321, 327}}

===Foreign affairs===
[[File:Hamilton Fish Brady Edited.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]]]]
Even before Grant became president, an annexationist faction in American politics desired control over the Caribbean islands.  [[William H. Seward]], Secretary of State under Lincoln and Johnson, having purchased [[Alaska]] from the Russians and attempted to buy the [[Danish West Indies]] from the Danes, began negotiations to [[Annexation of Santo Domingo|purchase the Dominican Republic]].{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=336<U+2013>338}}  These negotiations continued under Grant, led by [[Orville E. Babcock]], a confidant who had served on Grant's staff during the Civil War.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=336<U+2013>338}}  Grant was initially skeptical, but at the urging of the Admiral Porter, who wanted a naval base at [[Saman<U+00E1> Bay]], and Joseph W. Fabens, a New England businessman employed by the Dominican government, Grant examined the matter and became convinced of its wisdom.{{sfn|Smith|pp=500<U+2013>502}}  Grant sent Babcock to consult with [[Buenaventura B<U+00E1>ez]], the pro-annexation Dominican president, to see if the proposal was practical; Babcock returned with a draft treaty of annexation in December 1869.{{sfn|Smith|pp=500<U+2013>502}}  Grant believed in peaceful expansion of the nation's borders and thought the majority-black island would allow new economic opportunities for freedmen. The acquisition, according to Grant, would ease race relations in the South, clear slavery from [[Brazil]] and [[Cuba]], and increase American naval power in the Caribbean.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=455<U+2013>456}}  Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] dismissed the idea, seeing the island as politically unstable and troublesome.{{sfn|Smith|pp=500<U+2013>502}}  In the Senate, Charles Sumner opposed annexation because it would reduce the number of autonomous nations run by Africans in the western hemisphere.  Other senators objected for the opposite reason<U+2014>they did not wish to add more blacks to the American population.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=339<U+2013>341}}  Grant personally lobbied Senators to pass the treaty, going so far as to visit Sumner at his home.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=339<U+2013>341}}  Fish added to the effort out of loyalty to the administration, but to no avail; the Senate refused to pass the treaty. Sumner's role in leading the opposition led to unending political enmity between him and Grant{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=349<U+2013>352}}

Grant and Fish were more successful in their satisfaction of the [[Alabama claims|''Alabama'' claims]], a dispute between Great Britain and the United States. The dispute stemmed from the damage done to American shipping during the Civil War by five ships built for the Confederacy in British shipyards including, most famously, [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']].{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=334<U+2013>336}}  When the war ended, the United States demanded retribution, which the British refused to pay.  Negotiations continued fitfully, a sticking point being the claims of "indirect damages" as opposed to the discussion to the harm directly caused by the five ships.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=352<U+2013>354}} Again, Sumner was opposed, believing that the United States should seek a $2 billion reward payable in gold or, alternatively, by the cession of Canada.{{sfn|Smith|p=508}}  Fish convinced Grant that peaceful relations with Britain were more important than acquisition of more territory, and the two nations agreed to negotiate along those lines.{{sfn|Smith|pp=509<U+2013>511}}  A commission in Washington produced a treaty whereby an international tribunal would settle the damage amounts; the British admitted regret, rather than fault.{{efn|The international tribunal awarded the United States $15,500,000.}}  The Senate approved the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]], which also settled disputes over fishing rights and maritime boundaries, by a 50<U+2013>12 vote in 1871.{{sfn|Smith|pp=512<U+2013>515}}

Grant's attention was drawn to the Caribbean again in 1873, when a merchant ship, ''[[Virginius Affair|Virginius]]'', carrying war materials and men to aid the Cuban insurrection, was taken captive by a Spanish warship. ''Virginius'' was registered in the United States, but was secretly owned by Cuban insurgents. The passengers and crew, including eight United States citizens, were trying to illegally travel to Cuba to help overthrow the government. Spanish authorities executed the prisoners, and many Americans called for war with Spain.  Fish, with Grant's support, worked to reach a peaceful resolution.  Spain's President, [[Emilio Castelar y Ripoll]], expressed regret for the tragedy and agreed to determine reparations through arbitration; Spain surrendered the ''Virginius'' and paid a cash indemnity of $80,000 to the families of the executed Americans.{{sfn|Nevins|pp=667<U+2013>94}}  The administration's diplomacy was also at work in the Pacific as, in December 1874, Grant held a state dinner at the White House for the King of Hawaii, [[David Kalakaua]], who was seeking the importation of Hawaiian sugar duty-free to the United States.{{sfn|Kreiser|p=19}} Grant and Fish were able to produce a successful free trade treaty in 1875 with the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], incorporating the Pacific islands' sugar industry into the United States' economic sphere.{{sfn|Kreiser|p=19}}

===Gold standard and the Gold Ring===
[[image:President Grant Thwarting Gold Ring 1869 Currier & Ives.jpg|thumb|280px|Cartoon depicting Grant running from the Treasury to release gold into the market and defeat the Gold Ring]] 
Soon after taking office, Grant took steps to return the nation's currency to a more secure footing.  During the Civil War, Congress had authorized the Treasury to issue banknotes that, unlike the rest of the currency, were not backed by gold or silver.  The "[[United States Note|greenback]]" notes, as they were known, were necessary to pay the unprecedented bills the government racked up in fighting the war, but they also caused inflation and forced gold-backed money out of circulation; Grant was determined to return to pre-war monetary standards.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=279}}  Many in Congress agreed with Grant, and they quickly passed the [[Public Credit Act of 1869]], which guaranteed that bondholders would be repaid in gold, not greenbacks.{{sfn|Smith|pp=480<U+2013>481}}  Grant charged Treasury Secretary [[George S. Boutwell]] with rationalizing the treasury Department and improving tax collection. To strengthen the dollar, Boutwell, backed by Grant, sold gold from the Treasury each month and bought back high-interest Treasury bonds issued during the war; this had the effect of reducing the deficit, but deflating the currency.{{sfnm|Smith||1pp=480<U+2013>481|Ackerman||2pp=90<U+2013>91}}

These actions had a large impact on the nation's small gold market, and gold speculators tried to make a profit by anticipating how much gold Boutwell would sell in a given week.{{sfn|Smith|p=482}}  [[Abel Corbin]], Grant's brother-in-law, sought to use his connection with the president to gain inside information for himself and his associates, [[Jay Gould]], a Wall Street trader and railroad magnate, and his partner [[James Fisk (financier)|Jim Fisk]]. This group of collaborators was later called the "Gold Ring."{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=437<U+2013>439}}  Corbin convinced Grant to appoint [[Daniel Butterfield]] as assistant Treasurer, and Gould soon made Butterfield his informant.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=323<U+2013>324}}  Meanwhile, Gould and Fisk began to quietly stockpile gold.  Gould convinced Corbin that a high gold price would make the nation prosperous, and Corbin passed this theory on to Grant.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=437<U+2013>439}}  The conspirators believed they had convinced the president, and they continued to stockpile gold, hoping to sell into a rising market.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=440<U+2013>443}} After consulting with New York businessman [[Alexander Turney Stewart]] in early September, Grant stopped the sale of Treasury gold, believing a higher gold price would help Western farmers.{{sfn|Brands|p=441}} By mid September, however, Grant started to become suspicious of Corbin, particularly when Corbin tried to drive a wedge between Grant and Boutwell. {{sfn|Smith|pp=486<U+2013>487}}  The gold price continued to rise as the conspirators bought ever more.{{sfn|Smith|pp=486<U+2013>487}}  The rising price began to affect the wider economy, and Grant, seeing that the increase was unnatural, told Boutwell to sell gold, thereby reducing its price.{{sfn|Smith|pp=488<U+2013>489}}  Boutwell did so the next day, on September 22, 1869, later known as [[Black Friday (1869)|Black Friday]].  The sale of gold from the Treasury defeated Gould's corner on the market as the gold price plummeted, relieving the growing economic tension.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=445, 636}} Gould and Fisk managed to escape without much harm to themselves.{{sfn|Smith|p=490}}  A New York bank collapsed, and trading dried up for months; a general recession did not follow, however, and the economy resumed its post-war recovery.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=328}}

===Reelection===
{{main|United States presidential election, 1872}}
[[File:Grant Liberal Gratitude.jpg|thumb|alt=A Thomas Nast cartoon depicting Grant steering a ship and being challenged by opponents during presidential election of 1872.|Cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]] on Grant's opponents in the re-election campaign]]
Grant's personal reputation suffered from the continued scandals caused by his many corrupt appointees and personal associates. In addition to the Gold Ring, [[Ulysses S. Grant presidential administration scandals#New York custom house ring|corruption in the New York Customs House]] added to reformers' negative impressions of the administration.  The [[Cr<U+00E9>dit Mobilier of America scandal|Cr<U+00E9>dit Mobilier scandal]], in which a railroad company bribed many members of Congress, did not involve Grant, but did ensnare Vice President Colfax and added to the general sense of dishonesty in Washington.  To reach out to reformers, Grant encouraged Congress to create the [[Civil Service Commission]] in 1871, chaired by reformer [[George William Curtis|George W. Curtis]], which had the power to propose reforms. {{sfn|Patrick|p=172}} Grant accepted its reform recommendations, and they were implemented on January 1, 1872.{{sfn|Simon 2002|p=250}} Congress, however, refused to fund the Civil Service Commission in 1875 or pass legislation to enforce its recommendations.{{sfnm|Smith||1pp=589<U+2013>590|Patrick||2p=173}} Grant remained quiet on Civil Service reform after the election.{{sfn|Patrick||p=173}} There was further division within the party between the faction most concerned with the plight of the freedmen and that concerned with the growth of industry.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=488<U+2013>489}}  During the war, both factions' interests had aligned, and in 1868 both had supported Grant.  Since his first election, many intellectual party leaders were alienated by Grant, who sided with both capital and civil rights interests.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=488<U+2013>489}}

Many of such men bolted in 1872, calling themselves the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republicans]]. Led by [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]] of Massachusetts and Senator [[Carl Schurz]] of Missouri, they publicly denounced the political patronage system that Sumner called "[[Grantism]]" and demanded amnesty for Confederate soldiers.  The Liberal Republicans nominated [[Horace Greeley]], another Republican who had come to dislike Grant and his policies.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=494}}  The rest of the Republican Party nominated Grant for reelection, with [[Henry Wilson]] of Massachusetts replacing scandal-ridden Colfax as vice-presidential nominee.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=381}}  The Democrats, seeking to benefit from anti-Grant sentiment, quickly nominated Greeley as well.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=495}}  The fusion effort was unsuccessful, and Grant was easily reelected.  The Liberal Republicans were unable to deliver many votes, and Greeley was only successful in areas the Democrats would have carried without him.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=384}}  Grant won 56% of the poplar vote and an Electoral College landslide of 286 to 66.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=499}}{{efn|Greeley died after election day but before the day the [[Electoral College]] voted, so his votes were scattered among four other Democrats.}}

===Panic of 1873, the Long Depression, and currency debates===
[[File:Grant Inflation Bill Veto.jpg|thumb|left|280px|alt=A cartoon depicting Grant after vetoing the Inflation bill.|Grant congratulated for vetoing the "inflation bill" on April 22, 1874. Hamilton Fish, shown behind Grant, supported the veto.]]
At the end of his first term in early 1873, Grant signed the [[Coinage Act of 1873|Coinage Act]], making gold the only money standard in furtherance of [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]] policy; this meant that dollars would be exchanged on demand for only gold.{{sfn|Simpson|pp=Chron. XXXV}}  Grant's second term saw renewed economic turmoil.  In September 1873, [[Jay Cooke & Company]], a New York brokerage house, failed to fully sell a bond issue by [[Jay Cooke|Cooke's]] railroad, the [[Northern Pacific Railway]], and collapsed as a result.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=517}}  The collapse sent ripples through [[Wall Street]], and other banks and brokerages that owned railroad stocks and bonds found themselves ruined as well.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=517}}  On September 20, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] suspended trading for ten days.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=393}} Grant, who knew little about finance, traveled to [[New York]] to consult leading businessmen and bankers for advice on how to curb the panic, which became known as the [[Panic of 1873]].{{sfn|Smith|pp=576<U+2013>79}}  Grant believed that, as with the collapse of the Gold Ring in 1869, the panic was merely an economic fluctuation that affected bankers and brokers.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=518}}  He responded cautiously, instructing Treasury Secretary [[William Adams Richardson]] to purchase $10 million in government bonds, thus injecting cash into the system.  These purchases curbed the panic on Wall Street, but a five-year industrial depression, later called the [[Long Depression]], nonetheless swept the nation.{{sfn|Smith|pp=576<U+2013>79}}  Eighty-nine of the nation's 364 railroads went bankrupt.{{sfnm|McFeely 1981||1p=391|Smith||2pp=375<U+2013>77}}

After the Panic, Congress debated an inflationary policy to stimulate the economy and passed what became known as the Inflation Bill on April 14, 1874. Many farmers and workingmen favored the bill, which would add $64 million in greenbacks to circulation, but some Eastern bankers opposed it because it would weaken the dollar.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=395}}  Grant unexpectedly vetoed the bill on the grounds that it would destroy the credit of the nation.{{sfn|Smith|pp=580<U+2013>581}}  Grant's veto placed him securely in the conservative faction of the Republican party, and was the beginning of the party's commitment to a strong gold-backed dollar.{{sfn|Smith|pp=580<U+2013>581}} Grant later pressured Congress for a bill to further strengthen dollar by gradually reducing the number of greenbacks in circulation.  After losing the House to the Democrats in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1874|1874 elections]], the [[Lame duck (politics)|lame-duck]] Republican Congress did so. On January 14, 1875, Grant signed  the [[Specie Payment Resumption Act]] into law.{{sfn|Smith|pp=580<U+2013>581}} The Resumption Act required gradual reduction of the maximum value of greenbacks allowed to circulate and declared that the resumption of specie payment would begin in 1879.  At the same time, Grant replaced Richardson, who was involved in the [[Sanborn incident|a political scandal]], with [[Benjamin H. Bristow]] of Kentucky, who supported Grant's anti-inflationary hard money policy.{{sfn|Smith|pp=580<U+2013>581}}

=== Gilded Age corruption and reform ===
{{further|Ulysses S. Grant presidential administration scandals|Ulysses S. Grant presidential administration reforms}}
[[image:Whiskeyring.jpg|220px|thumb|Harper's Weekly cartoon on Bristow's Whiskey Ring investigation]]
Grant served as president during the [[Gilded Age]], a time when the economy was open to speculation and western expansion that fueled corruption in government offices. Against the harsh public revelation of the [[Credit Mobilier of America scandal|railroad bribery scandal]], which tarnished public perception, Grant also faced charges of misconduct in nearly all federal departments, especially in the Treasury and Interior departments, engaging his administration in constant conflict between corrupt associates and reformers.{{sfn|McFeely 1974|pp=133<U+2013>34}} Although personally honest with his own money matters, Grant had difficulty in spotting corruption in others.{{sfn|Woodward|pp=53<U+2013>108}}  He was protective of associates, whose persecutions he saw as unjust.{{sfn|Smith|p=587}}  Grant's military discipline produced a loyalty that shielded associates from attack at the expense of his own reputation, unless evidence of personal misconduct was overwhelming.{{sfn|Smith|p=587}} No person linked any of the scandals together, except possibly Grant's personal secretary, [[Orville E. Babcock]], who indirectly controlled many cabinet departments and delayed investigations.{{sfnm|McFeely 1974||1p=133|Woodward||2pp=53<U+2013>108}} In addition to the Gold Ring, Grant had to respond to a Congressional investigation into the Collectors Ring at the New York Custom House.{{sfn|McFeely (1974)|pp=134, 144}}

During Grant's second term in office, corruption in the Treasury Department was made public in the [[Sanborn incident]], in which John D. Sanborn (a friend of Congressman [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]], the erstwhile Civil War general) was hired as an independent tax collector on a percentage basis, also known as a ''moiety''.{{sfn|Smith|p=578}}  Treasury officials were then instructed not to press for payment, so that accounts would become delinquent and Sanborn would get paid more when he "discovered" them.{{sfn|Smith|p=578}}  Grant quietly appointed Treasury Secretary [[William Adams Richardson]] to the [[United States Court of Claims]], and appointed reformer [[Benjamin Bristow]] in 1874 as his replacement.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=556<U+2013>557}} To prevent future unscrupulous actions, Grant signed the Anti-Moiety Act into law in 1874, abolishing the troublesome payment system.{{sfn|McFeely 1974|pp=133<U+2013>134}} 
  
On becoming Treasury Secretary, the energetic Bristow immediately made a series of needed reforms.{{sfn|Brands 2012a||1pp=556<U+2013>557|Kohn||2p=417}} Finding that millions of dollars in revenue were missing, Bristow discovered what became known as the Whiskey Ring<U+2014>tax officials taking bribes in exchange for not taxing distillers. {{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=556<U+2013>557}} Having obtained Grant's initial endorsement, "Let no guilty man escape if it can be avoided", Bristow moved quickly in 1875 to raid and shut down corrupt distilleries, collapsing the Ring.{{sfn|Kohn|p=417}}  Bristow obtained 238 indictments, leading to 110 convictions, while millions of tax dollars were restored to the Treasury. {{sfn|Kohn|p=417}} Grant became defensive, however, after Bristow discovered that Babcock was involved in the Whiskey Ring, believing Babcock to be the innocent victim of a witch hunt.{{sfn|Smith|pp=591<U+2013>593}} Grant denied immunity to minor Whiskey Ring conspirators in the Midwest.{{sfn|Kohn|p=417}}  In 1876, Babcock was found not guilty at a trial in which Grant testified through a deposition on his behalf.{{sfn|Kohn|p=417}}  After the trial, under public pressure, Grant dismissed Babcock from the White House.{{sfn|Smith|pp=591<U+2013>593}}{{efn|McFeely, writing in 1981, believed that Grant knew Babcock was guilty, while Smith, in 2001, believed the evidence was circumstantial at best.{{sfnm|McFeely 1981||1p=415|Smith||2p=591}}}}  Several convicted Whiskey Ring members were later pardoned by Grant.{{sfn|Kohn|p=417}}

The scandals increased as Congress began several investigations into corruption in the administration, the most notable of which regarded [[trader post scandal (1876)|profiteering at western trading posts]].  The scheme involved Secretary of War [[William Belknap]] selling concessions for trading posts on western army bases in exchange for a cut of the profits.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=560}}  The accusations led to Belknap's resignation.  Even after he resigned from office, the House of Representatives impeached Belknap;{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=435<U+2013>436}} he was only saved from conviction in the Senate because many Senators believed their jurisdiction ended when Belknap left office.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=435<U+2013>436}}  Congress also investigated and reprimanded Navy Secretary [[George M. Robeson]] in 1876 for taking bribes from naval contractors, but he was never formally impeached.{{sfn|McFeely 1974|p=153}}

The Civil Service reform initiative had limited success, as Grant's cabinet implemented a merit system that increased qualified candidates and relied less on Congressional patronage.{{sfnm|Smith||1p=587<U+2013>590|Simon 2002||2p=250}} Grant's Secretary of Interior [[Columbus Delano]], however, exempted the Interior Department from competitive examinations, while Congress refused to enact permanent Civil Service reform.  Delano was forced to resign, having allowed a spoils system of land and patent frauds and ignored Interior department officials' award of surveying contracts to his son, who was paid without doing any of the contracted work.{{sfn|Smith|p=586}} Grant appointed [[Zachariah Chandler]], who succeeded Delano and cleaned up corruption in the Interior Department.{{sfn|Smith|p=587}}{{sfn|Simon||1p=250|Patrick||2p=172}} Grant appointed reformers [[Edwards Pierrepont]] and [[Marshall Jewell]] as Attorney General and Postmaster General, respectively, who supported Bristow's investigations. {{sfnm|Smith||1pp=584<U+2013>585|Hesseltine||2p=366}}  In 1875, Pierrepont cleaned up corruption among the U.S. Marshals and [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorneys]] in the South.{{sfn|Hesseltine|p=374}}  Grant suggested other reforms as well, including a proposal that states should provide free [[State school|public schooling]] to all children, although he also endorsed the [[Blaine Amendment]], which would have forbidden government aid to schools that have any religious affiliation.{{sfn|Smith|pp=570<U+2013>571}}

===Judicial appointments===
[[File:Ward Hunt - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|upright|Grant appointed Justice Ward Hunt to the Supreme Court, where he voted to uphold Reconstruction laws.]]
{{main|List of federal judges appointed by Ulysses S. Grant}}
Grant appointed four Justices to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].  The first two vacancies occurred in 1869 with the retirement of [[Robert C. Grier]] and Congress's restoration of a ninth seat on the Court.{{efn|Congress had changed the law in 1866 to eliminate one seat on the Court each time a justice retired, to prevent Andrew Johnson from nominating replacements for them.  When Grant took office, there were eight seats on the bench.{{sfn|Smith|pp=506<U+2013>507}}}}{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=387}}  Grant appointed former Secretary of War [[Edwin M. Stanton]] and Attorney General [[Ebenezer R. Hoar]].{{sfn|Smith|pp=506<U+2013>507}}  Neither man would take his seat: Stanton was confirmed, but died before he took office; Hoar was widely disliked in the Senate, which defeated his nomination 24<U+2013>33.{{sfn|Smith|pp=506<U+2013>507}}  Following a cabinet discussion, Grant submitted two more names to the Senate: [[William Strong (judge)|William Strong]] and [[Joseph P. Bradley]].  Strong was a former justice of the [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]] who retired to take up a private practice in Philadelphia.  Bradley, a New Jersey lawyer, also had a successful private practice. Both men were railroad lawyers, and their appointment led to accusations that Grant intended them to overturn the case of ''[[Hepburn v. Griswold]],'' which had been decided the same day they were nominated. That case, which was unpopular with business interests, held that the federal debt incurred before 1862 must be paid in gold, not [[United States Note|greenbanks]].{{sfn|Smith|pp=507<U+2013>508}}  Nonetheless, both Strong and Bradley were confirmed and the following year ''Hepburn'' was indeed reversed.{{sfn|Smith|pp=507<U+2013>508}}

After Grant's reelection, another Supreme Court seat opened up with the retirement of Justice [[Samuel Nelson]].{{sfn|Smith|pp=558<U+2013>563}}  Grant nominated [[Ward Hunt]], a New York state judge, to replace him.  Hunt was confirmed in 1873 and, like Nelson, upheld Reconstruction legislation.  He served on the court until 1882.{{sfn|Smith|pp=558<U+2013>563}}  In May 1873, Chief Justice [[Salmon P. Chase]] died suddenly.  After several months, Grant offered the seat to Conkling.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=387<U+2013>389}}  Conkling declined, as did Senator [[Timothy Howe]] of Wisconsin.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=387<U+2013>389}}  Grant unsuccessfully tried to enlist Hamilton Fish for the job and considered nominating [[Caleb Cushing]], as well, before submitting the name of his attorney general, [[George Henry Williams]].{{sfn|Smith|pp=558<U+2013>563}}  The Senate had a dim view of Williams's performance at the Justice Department and refused to act on the nomination.  Grant stuck to his choice, but after no action Williams asked that his name be withdrawn in January 1874.{{sfn|Smith|pp=558<U+2013>563}}  Fish suggested nominating Hoar again, but Grant instead chose Cushing.  Cushing was an eminent lawyer and respected in his field, but the emergence of his wartime correspondence with Jefferson Davis doomed his nomination.{{sfn|Smith|pp=558<U+2013>563}} Grant finally turned to [[Morrison Waite]], a respectable (if little-known) Ohio lawyer who had worked on the ''Alabama'' claims arbitration.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=392<U+2013>393}}  The Senate unanimously approved the nomination two days later, on January 21, 1874.  Waite was an uncontroversial nominee, but in his time on the Court he authored two of the decisions (''[[United States v. Reese]]'' and ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'') that did the most to undermine Reconstruction-era laws for the protection of black Americans.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=387<U+2013>389}}

===Election of 1876===
By 1876, the collected scandals of the last eight years and the Democratic gains in the House led many in the Republican party to repudiate Grant.{{sfnm|McFeely 1981||1pp=440<U+2013>441|Patrick||2p=255}} Bristow was among the leading candidates to replace him, suggesting that a large faction desired an end to "Grantism" and feared that Grant would run for a third term.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=440<U+2013>441}} Ultimately, Grant did not run, but neither was Bristow the nominee, as the convention settled on Governor [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] of Ohio, a reformer.  The Democrats nominated [[Samuel J. Tilden]] of New York, and [[United States presidential election, 1876|the election that year]] was undecided for several months because of voting irregularities in three Southern states.{{sfn|Smith|p=598}} Grant told Congress to settle the matter through legislation, without blaming either party.{{sfn|Patrick|p=263}} Grant mobilized troops in Louisiana and South Carolina, who kept the peace.{{sfn|Patrick|p=264}} Grant assured both sides that he would not use the army to force a result, except to curb violence, and agreed to the formation of an [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]] to decide the matter.{{sfnm|Smith||1p=601|Patrick||2p=267}}  The result was the [[Compromise of 1877]]: Hayes was elected, but the last troops were withdrawn from Southern capitals.{{sfn|Smith|p=604}}  The Republicans had won, but Reconstruction was over.

===World tour===
After leaving the White House, Grant and his family stayed with friends in New York, Ohio, and Philadelphia for two months, before setting out on a tour of the world.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=448<U+2013>449}}  The trip, which would last two years, began in Liverpool in May 1877, where enormous crowds greeted the ex-president and his entourage.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=454<U+2013>455}}  Travelling to London, the Grants dined with [[Queen Victoria]] at [[Windsor Castle]], and Grant gave several speeches in the city.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=581<U+2013>583}}  They next traveled to Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland, before returning to England.  The Grants spent a few months with their daughter [[Nellie Grant|Nellie]], who had married an Englishman and moved to that country several years before.  Returning to the continent, Grant and his wife journeyed on to France and Italy, spending Christmas 1877 aboard [[USS Vandalia (1876)|USS ''Vandalia'']], a warship docked in Palermo.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=460<U+2013>465}}  After a winter sojourn in the Holy Land, they visited Greece before returning to Italy and a meeting with [[Pope Leo XIII]].{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=466<U+2013>467}}  Travelling to Spain and then to Germany again, Grant met with Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], and the two men discussed military matters.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=585<U+2013>586}}

After another visit to England and then to Ireland, the Grants left Europe by ship, sailing through the [[Suez Canal]] to India.  They visited Bombay, Lucknow, Varanasi, and Delhi, being welcomed in each city by the colonial officials.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=471<U+2013>473}}  After India, they toured Burma, Siam (where Grant met King [[Chulalongkorn]],) Singapore, and Vietnam.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=590<U+2013>591}}  Traveling on to Hong Kong, Grant began to change his mind on the nature of colonization, believing that the British rule was not "purely selfish" but also good for the colonial subjects.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=471<U+2013>473}}  Leaving Hong Kong, the Grants entered China proper, seeing the cities of Canton, Shanghai, and Peking.  He declined to request an interview with the [[Guangxu Emperor]], a child of seven, but did speak with the head of government, [[Prince Gong (Qing dynasty)|Prince Gong]], and [[Li Hongzhang]], a leading general.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=591<U+2013>592}}  They discussed China's dispute with Japan over the [[Ryukyu Islands]], and Grant agreed to help bring the two sides to agreement.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=593<U+2013>594}}  After crossing over to Japan and meeting the [[Emperor Meiji]], Grant convinced China to acquiesce in Japanese annexation of the islands, and the two nations avoided war.{{sfn|Smith|pp=612n<U+2013>613n}}

By then the Grants had been gone two years, and were homesick.  They crossed the Pacific and landed in San Francisco in September 1879, greeted by cheering crowds.{{sfn|Smith|p=613}}  After a visit to [[Yellowstone National Park]], they returned at last to Philadelphia on December 16, 1879.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=477}}  The voyage around the world had captured popular imagination, and Republicans<U+2014>especially those of the new [[Stalwart (politics)|Stalwart]] faction, who had been excluded from the Hayes administration<U+2014>saw Grant in a new light.{{sfn|Smith|pp=614<U+2013>615}}  With Hayes having forsworn a second term when he was elected, the nomination for 1880 was wide open, and many thought that Grant was the man for the job.{{sfn|Smith|pp=614<U+2013>615}}

===Third term attempt===
[[File:Ulysses S. Grant Trapeze Cartoon Keppler Puck 1880.tif|thumb |''Puck'', a Democratic magazine, in 1880 lampooned Grant's support of "rings" of corruption among his associates.]]
{{main|1880 Republican National Convention}}
The Stalwarts, led by Grant's old political ally, [[Roscoe Conkling]], saw the ex-president's renewed popularity as a way for their faction to regain power. Opponents denounced his violation of the two-term rule that had been the norm since George Washington. Grant said nothing publicly, but privately he wanted the job and encouraged his men.{{sfn|Hesseltine|pp=432<U+2013>39}}  [[Elihu B. Washburne]] urged him to run; Grant demurred, saying he would be happy for the Republicans to win with another candidate, though he preferred [[James G. Blaine]] to [[John Sherman]].{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=600<U+2013>601}}  Even so, Conkling and [[John A. Logan]] began to organize delegates in Grant's favor.  When [[1880 Republican National Convention|the convention]] convened in Chicago in June, there were more delegates pledged to Grant than to any other candidate, but he was still short of a majority.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=600<U+2013>601}}

Conkling placed Grant's name in nomination with an elegant speech, his most famous line being: "When asked which state he hails from, our sole reply shall be, he hails from Appomattox and its famous apple tree."{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=600<U+2013>601}}  With 370 votes needed for nomination, the first ballot had Grant at 304, Blaine at 284, Sherman at 93, and the rest scattered to minor candidates.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=479<U+2013>481}}  Subsequent ballots followed, with roughly the same result; neither Grant nor Blaine could win.  After thirty-six ballots, Blaine's delegates deserted him and combined with those of other candidates to nominate a compromise candidate: Representative [[James A. Garfield]] of Ohio.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=602}}  Grant received 306 votes on the final ballot, but was unable to achieve a majority. The nomination was made unanimous in a procedural motion.{{sfn|Smith|p=617}}

Grant gave speeches for Garfield, but declined to criticize the Democratic nominee, [[Winfield Scott Hancock]], a general who had served under Grant in the Army of the Potomac.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=604<U+2013>605}}  Garfield was elected by a narrow popular margin, but a solid Electoral College vote<U+2014>214 to 155.  After the election, Grant gave Garfield his public support, and pushed him to include Stalwarts in his administration.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=607<U+2013>609}}

===Business ventures===
Grant's world tour, although successful, was costly.  When he returned to America, Grant had depleted most of his savings and needed to earn money and find a new home.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=611}} [[George William Childs]] and [[Anthony Joseph Drexel]], wealthy friends of Grant, bought him a home on Manhattan's [[Upper East Side]].{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=486<U+2013>489}}  To provide an income, Grant, Jay Gould, and former Mexican Finance Secretary [[:es:Mat<U+00ED>as Romero Avenda<U+00F1>o|Mat<U+00ED>as Romero]] chartered the Mexican Southern Railroad, which planned to build a railroad from Oaxaca to Mexico City.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=486<U+2013>489}}  At the same time, Grant used his influence to convince [[Chester A. Arthur]], who had succeeded Garfield as president in 1881, to negotiate a free trade treaty with Mexico.  Arthur and the Mexican government agreed, but the United States Senate rejected the treaty in 1883.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=486<U+2013>489}}  The railroad was similarly unsuccessful, falling into bankruptcy the following year.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=486<U+2013>489}}

At the same time, Grant's son [[Ulysses S. Grant, Jr.|Ulysses Jr.]] ("Buck") had opened a Wall Street brokerage house with [[Ferdinand Ward]].  Ward was regarded as a rising star, and the firm, Grant & Ward, was initially successful.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=488<U+2013>91}}  In 1883, Grant joined the firm and invested $100,000 of his own money.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=619}}  The firm's success attracted more investors, who bought [[Security interest|securities]] through them, and then used the securities as collateral to borrow money to buy more securities.  Grant & Ward then pledged that collateral to borrow more money to trade in securities on the firm's own account.  The practice<U+2014>called [[hypothecation]]<U+2014>was legal and accepted; what was illegal was ''rehypothecation'', the practice of pledging the same securities as collateral for multiple loans.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=488<U+2013>91}}  Ward, with the collusion of the bank involved, did this for many of the firm's assets.  If the trades resulted in profit, then there would be no problem; if they went bad, however, multiple loans would come due, all backed up by the same collateral.  Historians acknowledge that Grant was likely unaware of Ward's tactics, but it is unclear how much Buck Grant knew.  In May 1884, enough investments went bad to convince Ward that the firm would soon be bankrupted.  He told Grant of the impending failure, but suggested that it was a temporary shortfall.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=620<U+2013>621}}  Grant approached businessman [[William Henry Vanderbilt]], who gave Grant a personal loan of $150,000.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=492<U+2013>93}} Grant invested the money in the firm, but it was not enough to save the firm from failure.  Essentially penniless, but compelled by a sense of personal honor, Grant repaid Vanderbilt with his Civil War mementos. Although the market value did not cover the loan, Vanderbilt insisted it was paid in full.  The matter left Grant financially destitute.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=620<U+2013>621}}

===Memoirs and death===
[[File:US Grant in 1885.jpg|thumb|Grant working on his memoirs in 1885]]
Grant had forfeited his military pension when he assumed the presidency, but Congress restored him to the rank of General of the Army with full retirement pay in March 1885.{{sfn|Smith|pp=625}}  Around the same time, Grant learned that he was suffering from [[esophageal cancer|throat cancer]].{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=622<U+2013>626}}{{efn|Today, medical historians believed he suffered from a T<sub>1</sub>N<sub>1</sub> carcinoma of the tonsillar fossa.{{sfn|Renehan & Lowry|pp=377<U+2013>383}}}}  To restore his family's income, Grant wrote several articles on his Civil War campaigns for ''[[The Century Magazine]]'' at $500 each. The articles were well received by critics, and the editor, [[Robert Underwood Johnson]], suggested Grant write a book of memoirs, as Sherman and others had successfully done.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=494}}

Grant took up the project and asked his former staff officer, [[Adam Badeau]], to review his work.  Grant's son [[Frederick Dent Grant|Fred]] assisted with references and proofreading.  ''Century'' offered Grant a book contract with a 10% royalty, but Grant's friend, [[Mark Twain]], made his own offer to Grant for his memoirs, proposing a 75% royalty. Grant ultimately decided on Twain's publishing company, Charles L. Webster and Co.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=501<U+2013>505}}  Grant worked diligently on the memoir at his home in New York City, and then from [[Grant Cottage State Historic Site|a cottage]] on the slopes of [[Mount McGregor (mountain)|Mount McGregor]], finishing shortly before he died on July 23, 1885.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=629<U+2013>630}}  The book, entitled ''[[Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant]]'', was a success.  In the end, Julia Grant received about $450,000, suggesting a royalty of about 30%.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|pp=501<U+2013>505}}  The memoir has been highly regarded by the general public, military historians, and literary critics.{{sfn|Wilson|pp= 131<U+2013>73}}  Grant was a shrewd and effective writer, portraying himself in the persona of the honorable Western hero, whose strength lies in his honesty and straightforwardness.  He candidly depicts his battles against both the Confederates and internal Army foes.{{sfn|Russell|pp=189<U+2013>209}} Twain called the ''Memoirs'' a "literary masterpiece."  In reviewing the favorable literary critique of Grant's book, including the analyses of [[Matthew Arnold]] and [[Edmund Wilson]], author [[Mark Perry (author)|Mark Perry]] calls the ''Memoirs'' "the most significant work" of American [[non-fiction]].{{sfn|Perry|pp=234<U+2013>235}}

Grant died on July 23, 1885, at the age of 63.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=517}}  Sheridan, by now [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Commanding General of the Army]], ordered a day-long tribute to Grant on all military posts, and President [[Grover Cleveland]] ordered a thirty-day nationwide period of mourning.  After private services, Grant's body was placed on a funeral train and traveled via West Point to New York City, where a quarter of a million people viewed it in the two days prior to the funeral.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=633<U+2013>635}}  Tens of thousands of men, many of them veterans from the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] or other veterans' organizations, marched with Grant's casket as it was drawn by two dozen horses to [[Riverside Park (Manhattan)|Riverside Park]].{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=633<U+2013>635}}  His pallbearers included Union generals Sherman and Sheridan, Confederate generals Simon Bolivar Buckner and Joseph E. Johnston, Admiral David Dixon Porter, and John A. Logan, the head of the Grand Army.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=633<U+2013>635}}  His body was laid to rest in Riverside Park, first in a temporary tomb, and finally in a [[sarcophagus]] in a circular [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]  at the [[General Grant National Memorial]] ("Grant's Tomb"), the largest [[mausoleum]] in North America.  Attendance at the New York funeral topped 1.5 million.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|pp=633<U+2013>635}} Ceremonies were held in other major cities around the country, and those who eulogized Grant in the press likened him to [[George Washington]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]].{{sfn|Waugh|pp=215<U+2013>259}}

===Historical reputation===
Few presidents' reputations have changed as dramatically as Grant's.{{sfn|Foner 2012}}  After his death, Grant was popularly seen as "a symbol of the American national identity and memory."{{sfn|Waugh|p=2}}  Millions of people turned out for his funeral procession in 1885 and attended the 1897 dedication of his tomb.{{sfn|Waugh|p=2}}  At the same time, however, scholars portrayed his as the most corrupt administration in American history.{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=521}}  Northerners who desired national reconciliation distorted Grant's reputation, regarding the Union and Confederate causes on equal moral terms.{{sfn|Waugh|p=3}}  In the 1930s, biographer [[William B. Hesseltine]], noted that Grant's reputation worsened because "his enemies wrote better than his friends."{{sfn|Smith|p=14}} In 1931, the [[Dictionary of American Biography]] praised Grant's military vision and his execution of that vision in defeating the Confederacy, but of his political career, the authors were less complimentary.{{sfn|Paxson & Bach|pp=497<U+2013>501}}  Speaking specifically of the scandals, they wrote that "personal scandal has not touched Grant in any plausible form, but it struck so close to him and so frequently as to necessitate the vindication of his honor by admitting his bad taste in the choice of associates."{{sfn|Paxson & Bach|p=500}} [[William S. McFeely]] won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography|Pulitzer Prize]] for his negative 1981 biography that concluded, "He did not rise above limited talents or inspire others to do so in ways that make his administration a credit to American politics."{{sfn|McFeely 1981|p=522}}

Since 1990, historians have since taken a more favorable view, appreciating his protection of African Americans during Reconstruction and his peace policy towards American Indians, even though those policies failed.{{sfn|Waugh|p=2}}  Bruce Catton began the reassessment of Grant's military career in the 1960s, shifting the consensus from Grant as victor by brute force to that of a successful and skillful commander.{{sfn|Simon 1982|p=220}}  [[John Y. Simon]] wrote of McFeely's assessment, "Grant's failure as President&nbsp;... lies in the failure of the Indian peace policy and the collapse of Reconstruction&nbsp;... But if Grant tried and failed, who could have succeeded?"{{sfn|Simon 1982|p=221}} Simon stated that had Grant been assessed only for his first term in office he would be considered one of the United States ablest presidents, "remembered for his staunch enforcement of the rights of freedmen combined with conciliation of former Confederates, for reform in Indian policy and civil service, for successful negotiation of the Alabama Claims, and for delivery of peace and prosperity."{{sfn|Simon 2002|p=??}} However, Simon believes Grant's second term in office was weakened by the Liberal defections, the Panic of 1873, increase of scandals, and the North's retreat from Reconstruction.{{sfn|Simon 2002|p=??}}

The restoration of Grant's reputation continued with [[Jean Edward Smith]]'s 2001 biography, ''Grant''.  Smith argued that the same qualities that made Grant a success as a general carried over to his political life to make him, if not a successful president, than certainly an admirable one.{{sfn|Weigley|p=1105}}  Smith wrote that "the common thread is strength of character<U+2014>an indomitable will that never flagged in the face of adversity&nbsp;... Sometimes he blundered badly; often he oversimplified; yet he saw his goals clearly and moved toward them relentlessly."{{sfn|Smith|p=15}}  [[H.W. Brands]] continued Grant's rehabilitation in his 2012 book, ''The Man Who Saved the Union: Ulysses Grant in War and Peace''. In addition to praising Grant's skill as a general,  Brands's book, as Eric Foner wrote in a review, gives "a sympathetic account of Grant's forceful and temporarily successful effort as president to crush the Ku Klux Klan, which had inaugurated a reign of terror against the former slaves."{{sfn|Foner 2012}}  Brands writes favorably of Grant's military and political careers, alike, saying:
{{blockquote|As commanding general in the Civil War, he had defeated secession and destroyed slavery, secession's cause.  As President during Reconstruction he had guided the South back into the Union. By the end of his public life the Union was more secure than at any previous time in the history of the nation. And no one had done more to produce the result than he.{{sfn|Brands 2012a|p=636}}}}

===Memorials and library===
[[File:50 USD Series 2004 Note Front.jpg|thumb|Grant has appeared on the [[United States fifty-dollar bill]] since 1913.]]
{{see also|Ulysses S. Grant cultural depictions}}
Grant has a number of memorials in his honor, including the [[General Grant National Memorial]] in New York and the [[Ulysses S. Grant Memorial]] in Washington.  There are smaller memorials in Chicago's [[Lincoln Park]] and Philadelphia's [[Fairmount Park]].  [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] is named in his honor, as are [[Grant County (disambiguation)|a number of counties in western and midwestern states]].  From 1890 to 1940, a portion of what is now [[Kings Canyon National Park]] was called General Grant National Park, named for the [[General Grant tree|General Grant sequoia]].  He has appeared on the front of the [[United States fifty-dollar bill]] since 1913, and also [[US Presidents on US postage stamps|appears on several stamps]].  In May 2012, on the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Ulysses S. Grant Foundation, [[Mississippi State University#Mitchell Memorial Library|Mississippi State University]] was selected as the permanent location for Ulysses S. Grant's Presidential Library.<ref>See [http://www.usgrantlibrary.org/ website]</ref>  Historian John Simon edited Grant's letters into a 32-volume scholarly edition published by Southern Illinois University Press.<ref>See [http://www.siupress.com/Catalog/ProductSearch.aspx?ExtendedSearch=false&SearchOnLoad=true&rhl=U%20S%20Grant%20Papers&sj=1009&rhdcid=1009&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 Catalog].
