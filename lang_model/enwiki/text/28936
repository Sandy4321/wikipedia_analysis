In [[Greek mythology]], '''Protesilaus''' ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: {{ polytonic|<U+03A0><U+03C1><U+03C9><U+03C4><U+03B5><U+03C3><U+03AF><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}, '''Protesilaos'''), was a [[Greek hero|hero]] in the ''[[Iliad]]'' who was venerated at [[Temenos|cult site]]s in [[Thessaly]] and [[Thrace]]. Protesilaus was the son of [[Iphicles]], a "lord of many sheep"; as grandson of the eponymous Phylacos, he was the leader of the [[Phylace]]ans.<ref>[[Homer]]. ''[[Iliad]]'', 2.695. </ref> [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] surmised<ref name="Hyginus. Fabulae, 103">Hyginus. ''Fabulae'', 103.</ref> that he was originally known as Iolaus,<ref>Not to be confused with [[Iolaus]], the lover of [[Heracles]].</ref> but was referred to as Protesilaus after being the first (<U+03C0><U+03C1><U+1FF6><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C2>, ''protos'') to die at [[Troy]].

==Trojan War==
Protesilaus was one of the suitors of [[Helen]].<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus. ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|The Library]]'', 3.10.8; [[Hyginus]]. ''Fabulae'', 97.</ref> He brought forty black ships with him to Troy,<ref>''Iliad'' II; Pseudo-Apollodorus. Epitome of ''The Library'' E.3.14.</ref> drawing his men from flowering Pyrasus, coastal Antron and Pteleus, "deep in grass", in addition to his native [[Phylace]]. Protesilaus was the first to land: "the first man who dared to leap ashore when the Greek fleet touched the [[Troad]], [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] recalled, quoting "the author of the epic called the [[Cypria]]".<ref>Pausanias, iv.2.5.</ref>  An [[oracle]] had prophesied that the first Greek to walk on the land after stepping off a ship in the [[Trojan War]] would be the first to die,<ref name="Hyginus. Fabulae, 103"/> and so, after killing four men,<ref>Hyginus. ''Fabulae'', 114.</ref> he was himself slain by [[Hector]]. After Protesilaus' death, his brother, [[Podarces]], joined the war in his place.<ref>Homer. ''Iliad'', 2.705.</ref> The gods had pity on his widow, Laodamia, daughter of [[Acastus]], and brought him up from Hades to see her. She was at first overjoyed, thinking he had returned from Troy, but after the gods returned him to the underworld, she found the loss unbearable.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus. Epitome to ''The Library'', E.3.30; Ovid. ''Heroides'', 13.</ref>  She had a bronze statue of her late husband constructed, and devoted herself to it. After her worried father had witnessed her behavior, he had it destroyed; however, Laodamia jumped into the fire with it.<ref>Hyginus. ''Fabulae'', 104.</ref> Another source claims his wife was [[Polydora]], daughter of [[Meleager]].<ref>''The [[Cypria]]'', Fragment 17; cited in [[Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 4. 2. 7</ref>

==Cult of Protesilaus==
Only two ''[[Temenos|sanctuaries]]'' to Protesilaus are attested.<ref>Ludo de Lannoy, ed. Jennifer K. Berenson Maclean and Ellen Bradshaw Aitken, trs.,''Flavius Philostratus: On Heroes'' (1977, 2002) Introduction, liii.</ref> There was a shrine of Protesilaus at [[Phylace]], his home in Thessaly, where his widow was left lacerating her cheeks in mourning him<ref>''Iliad'' II.</ref>, and games were organised there in his honour, [[Pindar]] noted.<ref>Pindar. ''First Isthmian Ode'', 83f.</ref> The tomb of Protesilaus at [[Elaeus]] in the [[Thracian Chersonese]] is documented in the 5th century, when, during the [[Persian War]], votive treasure deposited at his tomb was plundered by the satrap Artayctes, under permission from [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]. The Greeks later captured and executed Artayctes, returning the treasure.<ref>[[Herodotus]]. ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', 9.116-120; see also 7.23..</ref> The tomb was mentioned again when [[Alexander the Great]] arrived at Elaeus on his campaign against the [[Persian Empire]]. He offered a sacrifice on the tomb, hoping to avoid the fate of Protesilaus when he arrived in Asia.  Like Protesilaus before him, Alexander was the first to set foot on Asian soil during his campaign.<ref>[[Arrian]]. ''The Campaigns of Alexander'', 1.11.</ref> [[Philostratus III|Philostratus]] writing of this temple in the early 3rd century AD,<ref>Philostratus. ''Heroikos'' ("Dialogue Concerning Heroes"). "Protesilaos" is set in the sanctuary; elms were planted at the sanctuary by the nymphs; the [[chthonic]] hero has given advice to athletes in the form of oracular dreams; see Christopher P. Jones, "Philostratus' Heroikos and Its Setting in Reality", ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''121''' (2001:141-149).</ref> speaks of a [[cult statue]] of Protesilaus at this temple "standing on a base which was shaped like the prow of a boat;" Gisela Richter noted coins of Elaeus from the time of [[Commodus]] that show on their reverses Protesilaus on the prow of a ship, in helmet, [[cuirass]] and short [[chiton]].

A founder-cult of Protesilaus at Scione, in [[Pallene, Chalcidice]], was given an [[etiology]] by the Augustan [[Conon (mythographer)|mythographer Conon]]<ref>Conon's abbreviated mythographies are known through a summary made by the ninth-century [[Photios I of Constantinople|patriarch Photius]] for his ''Biblioteca'' (Alan Cameron, ''Greek Mythography in the Roman World'' [Oxford University Press) 2004:72).</ref> that is at variance with the [[Epic Cycle|epic tradition]]. In this, Conon asserts that Protesilaus survived the Trojan War and was returning with Priam's sister Aethilla as his captive. When the ships put ashore for water on the coast of Pallene, between Scione and Mende, Aethilla persuaded the other Trojan women to burn the ships, forcing Protesilaus to remain and found the city of Scione. A rare tetradrachm of Scione ca. 480 BCE acquired by the [[British Museum]] depicts Protesilaus, identified by the retrograde legend <small>PROTESLAS</small>.<!--PROTESLAS is correct--><ref>G. F. H., "Protesilaos at Scione" ''The British Museum Quarterly'' '''1'''.1 (May 1926):24). </ref>

Protesilaus, speaking from beyond the grave, is the oracular source of the corrected eye-witness version of the actions of heroes at Troy, related by a "vine-dresser" to a Phoenician merchant in the [[framing device]] that gives an air of authenticity to the narratives of [[Philostratus]]' ''[[Heroicus]]'', a late literary representation of [[Greek hero|Greek hero-cult]] traditions that developed independently of the epic tradition.<ref>See Casey Du<U+00E9> and Gregory Nagy, "Preliminaries to Philostratus's ''On Heroes''", in Maclean and Aitken 2002.</ref>

==Representations==
Among very few representations of Protesilaus,<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], in his travels in Greece at the end of the 2nd century AD saw no statues of Protesilaus, though he appeared among the heroes painted by [[Polygnotus]] at [[Delphi]] (x.30.3).</ref> a sculpture by Deinomenes is just a passing mention in [[Pliny's Natural History]];<ref>'Historia Naturalis, 34.76.</ref> the outstanding surviving examples are two Roman copies of a lost mid-fifth century Greek bronze original represent Protesilaus at his defining moment, one of them in a torso the [[British Museum]],<ref>Found at [[Cyzicus]] in [[Mysia]] (modern Turkey).</ref> the other at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].<ref>Accession number 1925.25.116: Richter 1929b: Gisela M. A. Richter, "A Statue of Protesilaos in the Metropolitan Museum" ''Metropolitan Museum Studies'' '''1'''.2 (May 1929:187-200). </ref> The Metropolitan's sculpture of a heroically nude [[Corinthian helmet|helmeted]] warrior stands on a forward-slanting base, looking down and slightly to his left, with his right arm raised, prepared to strike, would not be identifiable, save by comparison made by Gisela Richter<ref>Richter 1929b.</ref> with a torso of the same model and its associated slanting base, schematically carved as the prow of a ship encircled by waves: Protesilaus about to jump ashore.

If [[Euripides]]' tragedy, ''Protesilaos'' had survived, his name would be more familiar today.<ref>So observed Gisela Richter, discussing the recently-acquired Metropolitan sculpture: Richter 1929a. "A Statue of Protesilaos" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'' '''24'''.1 (January 1929:26-29) p. 29.</ref>

==Laodamia==
Laodamia was the wife of Protesilaus and daughter of [[Acastus]] and [[Astydameia]]. After Protesilaus was killed in the [[Trojan War]] he was allowed to return to his wife for only three hours before returning to the underworld because they had only just married. Thereafter Laodamia committed suicide by stabbing herself, rather than be without him<ref>[[Apollodorus]], ''The Library'', [[Epitome]] of Book IV, 3. 30</ref><ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Heroides]]'', 13</ref>. According to [[Hyginus]]' ''Fabulae'', the story runs like this: "When Laodamia, daughter of Acastus, after her husband's loss had spent the three hours which she had asked from the gods, she could not endure her weeping and grief. And so she made a bronze likeness of her husband Protesilaus, put it in her room under pretense of sacred rites, and devoted herself to it. When a servant early in the morning had brought fruit for the offerings, he looked through a crack in the door and saw her holding the image of Protesilaus in her embrace and kissing it. Thinking she had a lover he told her her father Acastus. When he came and burst into the room, he saw the statue of Protesilaus. To put an end to her torture he had the statue and the sacred offerings burned on a pyre he had made, but Laodamia, not enduring her grief, threw herself on it and was burned to death."<ref>Hyginus' Fabulae 104</ref>
