===Film career===
[[File:SteveCarell07AA.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Carell at the Academy Awards in 2007]]
Carell's first major film role was as weatherman Brick Tamland in the 2004 hit comedy ''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy]]''. Struck by Carell's performance in the film, ''Anchorman'' producer [[Judd Apatow]] approached Carell about creating a film together, and Carell told him about an idea he had had involving a middle-aged man who is still a virgin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/od/the40yearoldvirgin/a/40yearsc041505.htm |title=40 Year Old Virgin - Steve Carell Interview |publisher=Movies.about.com |date=2014-03-04 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}</ref> The result was the 2005 film ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'', which Carell and Apatow developed and wrote together, starring Carell as the title character.

His work in the films ''Anchorman'', ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'', and ''Bewitched'' established Carell as a member of Hollywood's so-called "[[Frat Pack]]", a group of actors who often appear in films together, that also includes [[Ben Stiller]], [[Owen Wilson]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Vince Vaughn]], and [[Luke Wilson]].
