'''USS ''Wisconsin'' (BB-64)''' is an [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa''-class]] [[battleship]], and is the second ship of the [[United States Navy]] named in honor of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]]. She was built at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]], and [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on [[December 7]] [[1943]].

During her career ''Wisconsin'' served in [[World War II]], where she shelled [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[fortifications]] at [[Ulithi]] and [[Leyte Gulf]], and screened US [[aircraft carrier]]s as they conducted air raids against enemy positions. During the [[Korean War]] she shelled [[North Korean]] targets in support of [[United Nations|UN]] and [[South Korea]]n ground operations, after which she was decommissioned into the [[United States Navy reserve fleets]], better known as the mothball fleet. She was reactivated and modernized in 1986 as part of the "[[600-ship Navy]]" plan, and participated in the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. 

''Wisconsin'' was last decommissioned in September 1991, having earned a total of six [[service star|battle stars]] for war service in WWII and Korea, and a [[Navy Unit Commendation]] for service during the 1991 Gulf War, and currently functions as a museum ship at [[Nauticus, The National Maritime Center]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. ''Wisconsin'' was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] (NVR) [[17 March]] [[2006]], and is currently awaiting donation for permanent use as a [[museum ship]]. 

==Construction==
''Wisconsin'' was one of the "fast battleship" designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]]. She was the third of the four completed ships of the [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa'' class]] of [[battleship]]s.

Her keel was laid down on [[January 25]] [[1941]], at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on [[December 7]] [[1943]], sponsored by Mrs. Walter S. Goodland, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on [[April 16]] [[1944]], with Captain Earl E. Stone in command.

Although ''Wisconsin'' is numerically the highest numbered US battleship built, she was actually completed before [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']], making ''Missouri'' the last completed US battleship.

==World War II (1944-1945)==
===Shakedown and service with 3rd Fleet, Admiral Halsey===
After the ship's trials and initial training in the [[Chesapeake Bay]], ''Wisconsin'' departed [[Norfolk, Virginia]], on [[July 7]] [[1944]], bound for the [[British West Indies]]. Following her shakedown (conducted out of [[Trinidad]]) she returned to the builder's yard for alterations and repairs.

On [[24 September]] [[1944]], ''Wisconsin'' sailed for the west coast, transited the [[Panama Canal]], and reported for duty with the Pacific Fleet on [[2 October]]. The battleship later moved to [[Hawaii]]an waters for training exercises and then headed for the Western [[Caroline Islands]]. Upon reaching [[Ulithi]] on [[9 December]], she joined Admiral [[William F. Halsey]]'s Third Fleet.

''Wisconsin'' had arrived at a time when the reconquest of the [[Philippines]] was well underway. As a part of that movement, the planners had envisioned landings on the southwest coast of [[Mindoro]], south of [[Luzon]]. From that point, American forces could threaten Japanese shipping lanes through the South China Sea.

In preparation for the coming invasion of [[Mindoro]], ''Wisconsin'' was assigned to protect the Third Fleet's Fast Carrier Task Force (TF) 38, as they conducted air raids at [[Manila]] to soften up Japanese positions. 

The next day the weather, however, soon turned sour for Halsey's sailors. A furious [[typhoon]] struck his fleet, catching many ships refueling and with little ballast in their nearly dry bunkers. Three destroyers, [[USS Hull (DD-350)|''Hull'' (DD-350)]], [[USS Monaghan (DD-354)|''Monaghan'' (DD-354)]], and [[USS Spence (DD-512)|''Spence'' (DD-512)]], capsized and sank. ''Wisconsin'' proved her seaworthiness as she escaped the storm unscathed.

''Wisconsin''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s next operation was in the Philippines, specifically the occupation of Luzon. Bypassing the southern beaches, American amphibians went ashore at [[Lingayen Gulf]], the scene of the Japanese landings nearly three years before.

''Wisconsin'', armed with heavy anti-aircraft batteries, performed escort duty for TF 38's fast carriers during air strikes against Formosa, Luzon, and the Nansei Shoto, to neutralize Japanese forces there and to cover the unfolding Lingayen Gulf operations. Those strikes, lasting from [[3 January]] to [[22 January]] [[1945]], included a thrust into the South China Sea, in the hope that major units of the Japanese Navy could be drawn into battle.

''Wisconsin''<U+2019>s carrier group launched air strikes between [[Saigon]] and [[Camranh Bay]], [[Indochina]], on [[12 January]] resulted in severe losses for the enemy. TF 38's warplanes sank 41 ships and heavily damaged docks, storage areas, and aircraft facilities. [[Taiwan|Formosa]], already struck on [[3 January]] and [[4 January]], was raided again on [[9 January]], [[15 January]], and [[21 January]]. Throughout January ''Wisconsin'' shielded the carriers as they conducted air raids at [[Hong Kong]], [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[Hainan Island]], the Canton oil refineries, the Hong Kong Naval Station, and [[Okinawa]].

===Service with 5th Fleet, Admiral Spruance===
''Wisconsin'' was assigned to the Fifth Fleet when Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance]] relieved Admiral Halsey as Commander of the Fleet. She moved northward with the redesignated TF 58 as the carriers headed for the Tokyo area. On [[16 February]] [[1945]], the task force approached the Japanese coast under cover of adverse weather conditions and achieved complete tactical surprise. As a result, ''Wisconsin'' and the other ships shot down 322 enemy planes and destroyed 177 more on the ground.  Japanese shipping, both naval and merchant, suffered drastically, too, as did hangars and aircraft installations. 

''Wisconsin'' and the task force moved to [[Iwo Jima]] on [[17 February]] to provide direct support for the landings slated to take place on that island on [[19 February]]. They revisited [[Tokyo]] on [[25 February]] and, the next day, hit the island of [[Hachino]] off the coast of [[Honshu]] which resulted in heavy damage to ground facilities; additionally, the American planes sank five small vessels and destroyed 158 planes.

''Wisconsin'''s task force stood out of [[Ulithi]] on [[14 March]], bound for Japan. The mission of that group was to eliminate airborne resistance from the Japanese homeland to American forces off Okinawa. Enemy fleet units at [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] and [[Kobe]], on southern [[Honshu]], reeled under the impact of the explosive blows delivered by TF 58's airmen. On [[18 March]] and [[19 March]], from a point 100 miles (160 km) southwest of [[Kyushu]], TF 58 hit enemy airfields on that island; unfortunately, allied anti-aircraft fire on [[19 March]] failed to stop a [[Kamikaze]] attack on the carrier [[USS Franklin (CV-13)|''Franklin'' (CV-13)]]. That afternoon, ''Wisconsin'' and the task force retired from Kyushu, screening the blazing and battered flattop, and in doing so, the screen shot down 48 attackers. 

On [[24 March]], ''Wisconsin'' trained her 16 inch (406 mm) guns on targets ashore on Okinawa. Together with the other battlewagons of the task force, she pounded Japanese positions and installations in preparation for the landings. Japanese resistance, while fierce, was doomed to failure by dwindling numbers of aircraft and trained pilots.

[[Image:WWII Wisconsin.JPG|thumb|left|300px|''Wisconsin'' escorting US ''Essex''-class aircraft carriers in the [[Pacific Ocean]] during [[World War II]]. The tail crane was used to recover reconnaissance planes launched by ''Wisconsin''.]]
While TF 58's planes were dealing with [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']] and her escorts, enemy aircraft attacked the American surface units. Combat air patrols (CAP) shot down 15 enemy planes, and ships' gunfire shot down another three, but not before one Kamikaze attack penetrated the CAP and screen to crash on the flight deck of the fleet carrier [[USS Hancock (CV-19)|''Hancock'' (CV-19)]]. On [[11 April]], the Japanese renewed their Kamikaze attacks; and only drastic maneuvers and heavy barrages of gunfire saved the task force. Combat air patrols shot down 17 planes, and ships' gunfire shot down 12. The next day, 151 enemy aircraft attacked TF 58, but ''Wisconsin'', together with other units of the screens for the vital carriers, kept the Kamikaze pilots at bay and destroyed them before they could reach their targets. Over the days that ensued Japanese suicide attacks managed to crash into three carriers &mdash; [[USS Intrepid (CV-11)|''Intrepid'' (CV-11)]], [[USS Bunker Hill (CV-17)|''Bunker Hill'' (CV-17)]] and [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|''Enterprise'' (CV-6)]] &mdash; on successive days.

By [[4 June]], a typhoon was swirling through the Fleet. ''Wisconsin'' rode out the storm unscathed, but three cruisers, two carriers, and a destroyer suffered serious damage. Offensive operations were resumed on [[8 June]] with a final aerial assault on Kyushu. Japanese aerial response was virtually nonexistent; 29 planes were located and destroyed. On that day, one of <i>Wisconsin</i>'s floatplanes landed and rescued a downed pilot from the carrier [[USS Shangri-La (CV-38)|''Shangri-La'' (CV-38)]].

===Bombardment of Japan===
''Wisconsin'' ultimately put into [[Leyte Gulf]] and dropped anchor there on [[18 June]] for repairs and replenishment. Three weeks later, on [[1 July]], the battleship and her escorts sailed once more for Japanese home waters for carrier air strikes on the enemy's heartland. Nine days later, carrier planes from TF 38 destroyed 72 enemy aircraft on the ground and smashed industrial sites in the Tokyo area. ''Wisconsin'' and the other ships made no attempt whatsoever to conceal the location of their armada, due in large part to a weak Japanese response to their presence.

On [[16 July]], ''Wisconsin'' fired the 16 inch (406 mm) guns at the steel mills and oil refineries at [[Muroran]], Hokkaido. Two days later, she wrecked industrial facilities in the [[Hitachi Miro]] area, on the coast of Honshu, northeast of Tokyo itself. During that bombardment, [[United Kingdom|British]] battleships of the [[British Pacific Fleet]] contributed their heavy shellfire. By that point in the war, Allied warships such as ''Wisconsin'' were able to shell the Japanese homeland almost at will.

Task Force 38's planes subsequently blasted the Japanese naval base at [[Yokosuka]], and put the former fleet flagship [[Japanese battleship Nagato|''Nagato'']] out of action, one of the two remaining Japanese battleships. Throughout July and into August Admiral Halsey's airmen visited destruction upon the Japanese, the last instance being against Tokyo on [[13 August]] [[1945]]. Two days later, the Japanese surrendered. [[World War II]] was over at last.

''Wisconsin'', as part of the occupying force, arrived at Tokyo Bay on [[6 September]], three days after the formal surrender occurred on board the battleship [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''Missouri'' (BB-63)]]. During <i>Wisconsin</i>'s brief career in World War II, she had steamed 105,831 miles (170,318 km) since commissioning; had shot down three enemy planes; had claimed assists on four occasions; and had fueled her screening destroyers on some 250 occasions.

==Post WWII (1945-1950)==
Shifting subsequently to [[Okinawa]], the battleship embarked homeward-bound GIs on [[22 September]], as part of [[Operation Magic Carpet]] staged to bring soldiers, sailors, and marines home from the far-flung battlefronts of the Pacific. Departing Okinawa on [[23 September]], ''Wisconsin'' reached [[Pearl Harbor]] on [[4 October]], remaining there for five days before she pushed on for the west coast on the last leg of her state-side bound voyage. She reached [[San Francisco, California]], on [[15 October]].

Heading for the east coast of the United States soon after the start of the new year, 1946, ''Wisconsin'' transited the [[Panama Canal]] between [[11 January]] and [[13 January]] and reached [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]], on [[18 January]]. Following a cruise south to [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]],
[[Cuba]], the battleship entered the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] for overhaul. After repairs and alterations that consumed the summer months, ''Wisconsin'' sailed for South American waters.

Over the weeks that ensued, the battleship visited [[Valpara<U+00ED>so]], [[Chile]], from [[1 November]] to [[6 November]]; [[Callao]], [[Peru]], from [[9 November]] to [[13 November]]; [[Balboa, Canal Zone]], from [[16 November]] to [[20 November]]; and [[La Guaira, Venezuela]], from [[22 November]] to [[26 November]], before returning to Norfolk on
[[2 December]] [[1946]].

''Wisconsin'' spent nearly all of 1947 as a training ship, taking naval reservists on two-week cruises throughout the year. Those voyages commenced at [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], and saw visits conducted at [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Panama Canal]] Zone. While underway at sea, the ship would perform various drills and exercises before the cruise would end where it had started, at Bayonne. During June and July of 1947, ''Wisconsin'' took [[United States Naval Academy]] midshipmen on cruises to northern European waters.

In January 1948, ''Wisconsin'' reported to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Norfolk, for inactivation. Placed out of commission, in reserve on [[1 July]] [[1948]] ''Wisconsin'' was assigned to the Norfolk group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

==The Korean War (1950-1952)==
Her sojourn in "mothballs," however, was comparatively brief, due to the [[North Korea]]n [[Korean War|invasion of]] [[South Korea]] in late June 1950. ''Wisconsin'' was recommissioned on [[3 March]] [[1951]] with Captain Thomas Burrowes in command. After shakedown training, the revitalized battleship conducted two midshipmen training cruises, taking the officers-to-be to [[Edinburgh, Scotland]]; [[Lisbon, Portugal]]; [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]]; [[New York City]]; and [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]], [[Cuba]], before she returned to Norfolk. While leaving New York ''Wisconsin'' was accidentally grounded on mud flats in New York Harbor, but was freed on [[23 August]] with no damage to the ship.

''Wisconsin'' departed Norfolk on [[25 October]] [[1951]], bound for the Pacific. She transited the [[Panama Canal]] on [[29 October]] and reached [[Yokosuka, Japan]], on [[21 November]]. There, she relieved [[USS New Jersey (BB-62)|''New Jersey'' (BB-62)]] as flagship for Vice Admiral H. M. Martin, Commander, Seventh Fleet.

On [[26 November]], with Vice Admiral Martin and Rear Admiral F.P. Denebrink, Commander, Service Force, Pacific, embarked, ''Wisconsin'' departed Yokosuka for Korean waters to support the fast carrier operations of TF 77. She left the company of the carrier force on [[2 December]] and, screened by the destroyer [[USS Wiltsie (DD-716)|''Wiltsie'' (DD-716)]], provided gunfire support for the [[Republic of Korea]] (ROK) Corps in the [[Kasong]]-[[Kosong]] area. After disembarking Admiral Denebrink on [[3 December]] at [[Gangneung|Kangnung]], the battleship resumed station on the Korean "bombline," providing gunfire support for the American 1st Marine Division. <i>Wisconsin</i>'s shellings accounted for a tank, two gun emplacements, and a building. She continued her gunfire support task for the 1st Marine Division and 1st ROK Corps through [[6 December]], accounting for enemy bunkers, artillery positions, and troop concentrations. On one occasion during that time, the battleship received a request for call-fire support and provided three star-shells for the 1st ROK Corps, illuminating an enemy attack that was consequently repulsed with considerable enemy casualties.

After being relieved on the gunline by the [[heavy cruiser]] [[USS Saint Paul (CA-73)|''St. Paul'' (CA-73)]] on [[6 December]], ''Wisconsin'' retired only briefly from gunfire support duties. She resumed them, however, in the Kasong-Kosong area on [[11 December]] screened by the destroyer [[USS Twining (DD-540)|''Twining'' (DD-540)]]. The following day, [[12 December]], saw the embarkation in ''Wisconsin'' of Rear Admiral H. R. Thurber, Commander, Battleship Division 2. The admiral came on board via [[helicopter]], incident to his inspection trip in the Far East.

The battleship continued naval gunfire support duties on the "bombline," shelling enemy bunkers, command posts, artillery positions, and trench systems through [[14 December]]. She departed the "bombline" on that day to render special gunfire support duties in the [[Kojo]] area blasting coastal targets in support of [[United Nations]] (UN) troops ashore. That same day, she returned to the Kasong-Kosong area. On [[15 December]], she disembarked Admiral Thurber by helicopter. The next day, ''Wisconsin'' departed Korean waters, heading for the [[U.S. Fleet Activities Sasebo|Sasebo U.S. Fleet Activities base]] to rearm.

Returning to the combat zone on [[17 December]], ''Wisconsin'' embarked United States Senator [[Homer Ferguson]] of [[Michigan]] on [[18 December]]. That day, the battleship supported the 11th ROK invasion with night illumination fire that enabled the ROK troops to repulse 
a North Korean assault with heavy enemy casualties. Departing the "bombline" on [[19 December]], the battleship later that day transferred her distinguished passenger, Senator Ferguson, by helicopter to the carrier
[[USS Valley Forge (CV-45)|''Valley Forge'' (CV-45)]].

''Wisconsin'' next participated in a coordinated air-surface bombardment of [[Wonsan]] to neutralize pre-selected targets. She shifted her bombardment station to the western end of Wonsan harbor, hitting boats and small craft in the inner swept channel during the afternoon. Such activities helped to forestall any attempts to assault the friendly-held islands in the Wonsan area. ''Wisconsin'' then made an anti-boat sweep to the north, firing the five inch (127 mm) batteries on suspected boat concentrations. She then provided gunfire support to UN troops operating at the "bombline" until three days before Christmas 1951. She then rejoined the carrier task force.

[[Image:Wisconsin in Korea.JPG|thumb|right|300px|''Wisconsin'' shells North Korean targets during the Korean War]]
On [[28 December]], [[Francis Cardinal Spellman]], on a Korean tour over the Christmas holidays, visited the ship, coming on board by helicopter to celebrate Mass for the [[Catholic]] members of the crew. He left the ship by helicopter off [[Pohang]]. Three days later, on the last day of the year, ''Wisconsin'' put into Yokosuka.

''Wisconsin'' departed that Japanese port on [[8 January]] [[1952]] and headed for Korean waters once more. She reached [[Pusan]] the following day and entertained the [[President of South Korea]], [[Syngman Rhee]], and his wife, on [[10 January]]. President and Mrs. Rhee received full military honors as they came on board, and he reciprocated by awarding Vice Admiral Martin the ROK Order of the Military Merit.

''Wisconsin'' returned to the "bombline" on [[11 January]] and, over the ensuing days, delivered heavy gunfire support for the 1st Marine Division and the 1st ROK Corps. As before, her primary targets were command posts, shelters, bunkers, troop concentrations and mortar positions. As before, she stood ready to deliver call-fire support as needed. One such occasion occurred; on [[14 January]] when she shelled enemy troops in the open at the request of the ROK 1st Corps.

Rearming at Sasebo and once more joining TF 77 off the coast of Korea soon thereafter, ''Wisconsin'' resumed support at the "bombline" on [[23 January]]. Three days later, she shifted once more to the Kojo region, to participate in a coordinated air and gun strike. That same day, the battleship returned to the "bombline" and shelled the command post and communications center for the 15th North Korean Division during call-fire missions for the 1st Marine Division.

Returning to Wonsan at the end of January, ''Wisconsin'' bombarded enemy guns at [[Hodo Pando]] before she was rearmed at Sasebo. The battleship rejoined TF 77 on [[2 February]] and the next day, blasted railway buildings and marshaling yards at Hodo Pando and Kojo before rejoining TF 77. After replenishment at Yokosuka a few days later, she returned to the Kosong area and resumed gunfire support. During that time, she destroyed railway bridges and a small shipyard besides conducting call-fire missions on enemy command posts, bunkers, and personnel shelters, making numerous cuts on enemy trench lines in the process.

On [[26 February]], ''Wisconsin'' arrived at Pusan where Vice Admiral Shon, the ROK Chief of Naval Operations; United States Ambassador J.J. Muccio; and Rear Admiral Scott-Montcrief, [[Royal Navy]], Commander, Task Group 95.12, visited the battleship. Departing that South Korean port the following day, ''Wisconsin'' reached Yokosuka on [[2 March]]. A week later, she shifted to Sasebo to prepare to return to Korean waters.

''Wisconsin'' arrived off [[Kimchaek | Songjin, Korea]], on [[15 March]] [[1952]] and concentrated her gunfire on enemy railway transport. Early that morning, she destroyed a communist troop train trapped outside of a destroyed tunnel. That afternoon, she received the first 
direct hit in her history, when one of four shells from a communist 155 mm gun battery struck the shield of a starboard 40 mm mount. Although little material damage resulted, three men were injured. ''Wisconsin'' subsequently destroyed that battery with a 16 inch (406 mm) salvo before continuing her mission. After lending a hand to support once more the 1st Marine Division with her heavy rifles, the battleship returned to Japan on [[19 March]].

Relieved as flagship of the Seventh Fleet on [[1 April]] by sister ship
[[USS Iowa (BB-61)|''Iowa'' (BB-61)]], ''Wisconsin'' departed Yokosuka, bound for the United States. En route home, she touched briefly at Guam, where she took part in the successful test of the Navy's largest floating dry-dock on [[4 April]] and [[5 April]], marking the first time that an
[[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa''-class battleship]] had ever utilized that type of facility. She continued her homeward-bound voyage, via Pearl Harbor, and arrived at [[Long Beach, California]], on [[19 April]], she then sailed for Norfolk.

===Post Korean War (1952-1981)===
Early in June 1952, ''Wisconsin'' resumed her role as a training ship, taking midshipmen to [[Greenock, Scotland]]; [[Brest, France]]; and [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]], [[Cuba]], before returning to Norfolk. She departed Hampton Roads on [[25 August]] and participated in the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] exercise Operation Mainbrace. After her return to Norfolk, ''Wisconsin'' underwent an overhaul in the naval shipyard there. ''Wisconsin'' remained in the Atlantic fleet throughout 1952 and into 1953, training midshipmen and conducting exercises. After a month of routine maintenance ''Wisconsin'' departed Norfolk on [[9 September]] [[1953]], bound for the Far East.

Sailing via the [[Panama Canal]] to Japan, ''Wisconsin'' relieved [[USS New Jersey (BB-62)|''New Jersey'' (BB-62)]] as Seventh Fleet flagship on [[12 October]]. During the months that followed, ''Wisconsin'' visited the Japanese ports of [[Kobe]], [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo Navy Yard]], [[Yokosuka]], [[Otaru]], and [[Nagasaki]]. She spent [[Christmas]] at [[Hong Kong]] and was ultimately relieved of flagship duties on [[1 April]] [[1954]] and returned to the [[United States]] soon thereafter, reaching Norfolk, via Long Beach and the Panama Canal, on [[4 May]] [[1954]].

Entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on [[11 June]], ''Wisconsin'' underwent a brief overhaul and commenced a midshipman training cruise on [[12 July]]. After revisiting Greenock, Brest, and Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay, the ship returned to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for repairs. Shortly thereafter, ''Wisconsin'' participated in Atlantic Fleet exercises as flagship for Commander, Second Fleet. Departing Norfolk in January 1955, ''Wisconsin'' took part in Operation Springboard, during which time she visited Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Then, upon returning to Norfolk, the battleship conducted another midshipman's cruise that summer, visiting Edinburgh; [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]; and Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay before returning to the United States.

Upon completion of a major overhaul at the [[New York Naval Shipyard]], ''Wisconsin'' headed south for refresher training in the [[Caribbean Sea]], later taking part in another Springboard exercise. During that cruise, she again visited Port-au-Prince and added [[Tampico, Mexico]], and [[Cartagena, Colombia]], to her list of ports of call. She returned to Norfolk on the last day of March 1955 for local operations. On [[19 October]] [[1955]], while operating in the [[East River]] in the New York Harbour ''Wisconsin'' was accidentally grounded.  Fortunately, the ship was freed in about an hour without any serious damage.

[[Image:USSWisconsonOops.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Post-collision damage to ''Wisconsin''<U+2019>s [[bow (ship)|bow]] after [[6 May]] [[1956]] collision with [[USS Eaton (DDE-510)]]]]
Throughout April and into May, ''Wisconsin'' operated locally off the Virginia capes. On [[6 May]], the battleship collided with the destroyer [[USS Eaton (DDE-510)|''Eaton'' (DDE-510)]] in a heavy fog; ''Wisconsin'' put into Norfolk with extensive damage to her bow and, one week later, entered dry dock at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. A novel expedient speeded her repairs and enabled the ship to carry out her scheduled midshipman training cruise that summer. A 120 ton, 68 foot (21 m) section of the bow of the uncompleted battleship [[USS Kentucky (BB-66)|''Kentucky'']] was transported by barge, in one section, from [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding]] and Drydock Corporation of [[Newport News, Virginia]], across [[Hampton Roads]] to the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]]. Working round-the clock, <i>Wisconsin</i>'s ship's force and shipyard personnel completed the operation which grafted the new bow on the old battleship in a mere 16 days. On [[28 June]] [[1956]], the ship was ready for sea.

''Wisconsin'' resumed her midshipman training on [[9 July]]. That autumn, ''Wisconsin'' participated in Atlantic Fleet exercises off the coast of the Carolinas, returning to port on [[8 November]] [[1956]]. Entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard a week later, the battleship underwent major repairs that were not finished until [[2 January]] [[1957]].

After local operations off the Virginia capes from [[3 January]] to [[4 January]] and from [[9 January]] to [[11 January]], ''Wisconsin'' departed Norfolk on [[16 January]], reporting to Commander, Fleet Training Group, at Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay. ''Wisconsin'' served as Admiral [[Henry Crommelin]]'s flagship during the ensuing shore bombardment practices and other exercises held off the isle of [[Culebra, Puerto Rico]], from [[2 February]] to [[4 February]] [[1957]]. Sailing for Norfolk upon completion of the training period, the battleship arrived on [[7 February]] and resumed local operations off Norfolk. On [[27 March]] ''Wisconsin'' sailed for the [[Mediterranean Sea]], reaching [[Gibraltar]] on [[6 April]], she pushed on that day to rendezvous with TF 60 in the [[Aegean Sea]] before reporting to [[Turkey]] for the NATO Exercise Red Pivot.

Departing Xeros Bay on [[14 April]], she arrived at [[Naples]] four days later, ''Wisconsin'' conducted exercises in the eastern Mediterranean. In the course of those operational training evolutions, she rescued a pilot and crewman who survived the crash of a plane from the carrier [[USS Forrestal (CVA-59)|''Forrestal'' (CVA-59)]]. ''Wisconsin'' reached [[Valencia, Spain]], on [[10 May]] and, three days later, entertained prominent civilian and military officials of the city.

Departing Valencia on [[17 April]], ''Wisconsin'' reached Norfolk on [[27 May]]. On that day, Rear Admiral L.S. Parks relieved Rear Admiral Crommelin as Commander, Battleship Division 2. Departing Norfolk on [[19 June]], the battleship, over the ensuing weeks, conducted a midshipman training cruise through the Panama Canal to South American waters, and reached Valparaiso on [[3 July]]. Eight days later, the battleship headed back to the Panama Canal and the Atlantic.

After exercises at Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay and off Culebra, ''Wisconsin'' reached Norfolk on [[5 August]] and conducted local operations that lasted into September. She then participated in NATO exercises which took her across the North Atlantic to the [[British Isles]].

<i>Wisconsin</i>'s days as an active fleet unit were numbered, and she prepared to make her last cruise. On [[4 November]] [[1957]], she departed Norfolk with a large group of prominent guests on board. Reaching New York City on [[6 November]], the battleship disembarked her guests and, on [[8 November]], headed for [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], to commence pre-inactivation overhaul. She was placed out of commission at Bayonne on [[8 March]] [[1958]], and joined the "Mothball Fleet" there, leaving the [[United States Navy]] without an active battleship for the first time since 1896. Subsequently taken to the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]], ''Wisconsin'' remained there with her sister ship ''Iowa'' into the 1980s.

==Reactivation (1986-1990)==
[[Image:Wisconsin Preps.jpg|thumb|left|275px|''Wisconsin'' prepares to fire her 16 inch (406 mm) guns sometime after her 1986 modernization.]]

As part of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]'s  [[Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[John F. Lehman]]'s effort to create a "[[600-ship Navy]]" ''Wisconsin'' was reactivated in August of 1986, and arrived at [[Ingalls Shipbuilding]] for her modernization. During the modernization ''Wisconsin'' had all of her remaining [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20 mm]] and [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40 mm]] anti-aircraft guns removed, due to their ineffectiveness against modern day [[Fighter aircraft|jet fighter]]s and enemy anti-ship missiles; additionally, the two 5" gun mounts located in the aft on the port and starboard side of the battleship were removed.

Over the next several months the ship was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available; among the new weapons systems installed were four MK 141 quad cell launchers for 16 [[AGM-84 Harpoon]] anti-ship missiles, eight [[Armored Box Launcher|Armored Box Launcher (ABL)]] mounts for 32 [[BGM-109 Tomahawk]] [[missile]]s, and a quartet of the United States Navy's [[Phalanx CIWS|Phalanx]] [[Close-in weapon system|Close In Weapon System (CIWS)]] [[gatling gun]]s for defense against enemy [[anti-ship missile]]s and enemy aircraft. ''Wisconsin'' also received eight [[RQ-2 Pioneer]] [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]]s, which are remotely controlled drones that replaced the helicopters previously used to spot for her nine 16"/50 Mark 7 guns. Also included in her modernization were upgrades to [[radar]] and [[fire control system]]s for her guns and missiles, and improved [[electronic warfare]] capabilities.<ref>[http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/weaps/mk-141.htm Information from the Federation of American Scientists]</ref><ref>[http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/bb-61.htm Federation of American Scientists report]</ref> Armed as such, ''Wisconsin'' was formally recommissioned on [[22 October]] [[1988]] in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]] and assigned to the United States Atlantic fleet. 

''Wisconsin'' spent the first part of 1989 conducting training exercises in the [[Atlantic]] and off the coast of [[Puerto Rico]] before returning to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a post recommissioning shakedown that lasted the rest of the year. In mid-1990 the battleship participated in a fleet exercise.

==Gulf War (1990-1991)==
On [[2 August]] [[1990]] [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Iraq]] invaded [[Kuwait]]. In the middle of the month, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]], in keeping with the [[Carter Doctrine]], sent the first of several hundred thousand troops, along with a strong force of naval support to [[Saudi Arabia]] and the Persian Gulf area to support a multi-national force in a standoff with the Iraqi dictator. On [[7 August]]  [[1990]] ''Wisconsin'' was ordered to deploy in defense of [[Kuwait]] for [[Operation Desert Shield]], and arrived in the Persian Gulf [[23 August]]. When [[Operation Desert Shield]] became [[Operation Desert Storm]], ''Wisconsin'' found herself serving alongside her older sister [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''Missouri'']], just as she had done in Korea forty years previously. Both ''Wisconsin'' and ''Missouri'' launched missile attacks against [[Iraq]]; they were among the first ships to fire off missiles during the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. ''Wisconsin'' served as the TLAM strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of [[Operation Desert Storm]] and firing a total of 24 of her own TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign.<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/wars/dstorm/ds5.htm Timeline for Operation Desert Storm]</ref>

''Wisconsin'', escorted by [[USS Nicholas (FFG-47)|''Nicholas'']], relieved [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''Missouri'']] on [[6 February]], then answered her first combat call for gunfire support since March 1952. The most recently recommissioned battleship sent 11 shells across 19 miles of space to destroy an Iraqi [[artillery]] battery in southern Kuwait. Using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) as a spotter in combat for the first time, ''Wisconsin'' pounded Iraqi targets and Iraqi boats that had been used during raids along the [[Saudi Arabia]]n coast. On [[7 February]] ''Wisconsin'' fired her guns against Iraqi artillery sites, missile facilities, and [[electronic warfare]] sites along the coast. She also targeted naval sites with her 16-inch guns firing several rounds which severely damaged or sunk 15 Iraqi boats, and destroyed several piers at the Khawr al-Mufattah [[Marina]].<ref>[http://www.usswisconsin.org/General/Ships%20History.htm Information taken from usswisconsin.org]</ref> In response to calls for fire support from U.S. and coalition forces ''Wisconsin''<U+2019>s turrets boomed again on [[9 February]], blasting [[bunker]]s and artillery sites, and shelling Iraqi troop positions near Khafji after the Iraqis were ousted from the city by Saudi and [[Qatar]]i armor. ''Wisconsin'' and ''Missouri'' alternated positions on the gun line, using their 16-inch guns to destroy enemy targets and soften defenses along the Kuwait coastline for a possible amphibious assault. 

On the night of [[23 February]] ''Missouri'' and ''Wisconsin'' turned their big guns on [[Faylaka Island]] to support the ground offensive in Iraq. The two ships were to conduct a [[feint|diversionary assault]] aimed at convincing the Iraqi forces arrayed along the shores of Faylaka Island that Coalition forces were preparing to launch an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious invasion]]. As part of this attack ''Missouri'' and ''Wisconsin'' were directed to shell known Iraqi defensive positions on the island. Shortly after ''Missouri'' completed her shelling of Faylaka Island ''Wisconsin'', while still over the horizon (and thus out of visual range of the Iraqi forces) launched her [[RQ-2 Pioneer]] [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]] to spot for her 16-inch guns. As ''Wisconsin''<U+2019>s drone approached Faylaka Island the pilot of the drone was instructed to fly the vehicle low over Iraqi positions so that the soldiers would know that they were once again being targeted by a battleship. Iraqi troops on the ground heard the Pioneer<U+2019>s distinctive buzzing sound, and having witnessed the effects of ''Missouri''<U+2019>s artillery strike on their trenchline the Iraqi troops decided to signal their willingness to [[surrender]] by waving makeshift [[white flag]]s, an action dutifully noted aboard ''Wisconsin''. Amused at this sudden development the men assigned to the drone<U+2019>s aircrew called ''Wisconsin''<U+2019>s commanding officer, Captain David S. Bill III, and asked, "Sir, they want to surrender, what should I do with them?"<ref>[https://wrc.navair-rdte.navy.mil/warfighter_enc/aircraft/UAVs/pioneer.htm US Navy RQ-2 Pioneer UAV site]</ref> This surrender to ''Wisconsin''<U+2019>s Pioneer has since become one of the most remembered moments of the Gulf War; the incident was also the first-ever surrender of enemy troops to an unmanned aircraft.<ref>[http://www.fas.org/irp/program/collect/pioneer.htm Federation of American Scientists report on the RQ-2 Pioneer UAV]</ref><ref>[http://www.nasm.si.edu/research/aero/aircraft/pioneer.htm Pioneer use during Operation Desert Storm]</ref> 

The next day ''Wisconsin'' answered two separate call fire support missions for coalition forces by suppressing Iraqi troops barricaded in a pair of bunkers. After witnessing the effects of ''Wisconsin''<U+2019>s strike against the Iraqi positions an elated Saudi marine commander commented over the radio, "I wish we had a battleship in our navy."<ref>[http://www.usswisconsin.org/General/Ships%20History.htm Information taken from usswisconsin.org]</ref>

Both ''Wisconsin'' and ''Missouri'' passed the million-pound mark of ordnance delivered on Iraqi targets by the time [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] ended hostilities on [[28 February]]. With one last salvo from her big guns, ''Wisconsin'' fired the last naval gunfire support mission of the war. ''Wisconsin'' remained in the Persian Gulf after the cease-fire took effect, and returned home  on [[28 March]] [[1991]]. During the 6 months ''Wisconsin'' spent in the Persian Gulf she had flown 348 UAV hours, recorded 661 safe helicopter landings, steamed 46,000 nautical miles, fired 528 16-inch rounds, 881 5-inch rounds, and 5,200 20mm Phalanx CIWS rounds.<ref>[http://www.usswisconsin.org/General/Ships%20History.htm Information taken from usswisconsin.org]</ref> As of 1992 this remains the last time that United States battleships actively participated in a foreign war.

==Museum ship (1992-present)==
[[Image:USS Wisconsin BB-64 2004 night.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Berthed in Norfolk at night ([[April 3]] [[2004]])]]
With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in the early 1990s and the absence of a perceived threat to the United States came drastic cuts in the defense budget, and the high cost of maintaining and operating battleships as part of the United States Navy's active fleet became uneconomical; as a result, ''Wisconsin'' was decommissioned on [[30 September]] [[1991]]. On [[15 October]] [[1996]] she was moved to the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]]. On [[7 December]] [[2000]] the battleship was towed from Norfolk and berthed adjacent to [[Nauticus, The National Maritime Center]] in Norfolk. Her weather decks have since been opened to the public, but the ship is still owned by the Navy and is considered part of the [[mothball fleet]]. 

''Wisconsin'' was named as one of two US Navy battleships that were to be maintained in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996<ref>[http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/bb-61.htm Federation of American Scientists report on the ''Iowa''-class battleships]</ref> (the other was ''Iowa''); however, the 2006 Defense Appropriations Act authorized the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] to strike ''Wisconsin'' from the NVR, clearing the way for her to be donated for permanent use as a museum ship. Acting on this authority the navy officially struck USS ''Wisconsin'' from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] (NVR) [[17 March]] [[2006]]. This is the first step in preparing ''Wisconsin'' for her ultimate transfer for use as a museum ship. Although ''Wisconsin'' has been struck from the NVR she has yet to be transferred to any memorial association. <ref>[http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/BB64.htm Information obtained from the United States Naval Vessel Registar website]</ref> Prior to the removal of ''Iowa'' and ''Wisconsin'' the estimated cost of refurbishing them had been priced at either $430 million for a 14-month program or $500 million for a 10-month program. <ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/12/06/novak.marines/index.html cnn.com report]</ref>

===Decorations===
''Wisconsin'' earned five [[battle stars]] for her [[World War II]] service and one for the [[Korean War]]. The ship also received the [[Navy Unit Commendation]] for service during the 1991 [[Gulf War]].<ref>[http://www.usswisconsin.org/Ship's%20Awards/ship's_awards.htm A complete list of ''Wisconsin''<U+2019>s decorations can be found here]</ref>
