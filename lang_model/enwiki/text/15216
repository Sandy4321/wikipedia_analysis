The '''Olm''' or '''Proteus''' ('''''Proteus anguinus''''') is an [[amphibian]] living in subterranean waters of the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric]] [[karst]] from the [[So<U+010D>a]] river basin near [[Trieste]] in [[Italy]] through southern [[Slovenia]] and southwestern [[Croatia]] to [[Herzegovina]]. It is the only [[species]] in the [[genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Proteus]]'', the only [[Europe]]an species of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Proteidae]], and the only European [[Troglobite|cave-dwelling]] [[chordate]]. It is also called the "humanfish" (translated literally from [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]]: ''<U+010C>love<U+0161>ka ribica'' and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''<U+010C>ovje<U+010D>ja ribica''), Cave [[Salamander]], or White Salamander.<ref name="istria">[http://www.istrianet.org/istria/fauna/amphibians/proteus-anguinus1.htm Istria on the Internet - Proteus anguinus (Olm)]. Retrieved on 7 June 2007.</ref> 

This animal is most notable for its adaptations to life in the complete darkness of its underground habitat. Its [[eye]]s have [[atrophy|atrophied]], leaving the Olm blind, while its other [[sense]]s, particularly those of [[smell]] and [[hearing]], have become sharper to compensate. It also has no [[skin]] [[pigment|pigmentation]]. In contrast to other amphibians, the Olm is wholly aquatic, not only breeding but living its entire life underwater.<ref name="animal">{{cite book |author=Burnie D. & Wilson D.E. (eds.) |title=Animal |publisher=DK |location=London |year=2001 |pages=61, 435 |isbn=0-7894-7764-5 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> This is possible due to [[larva]]l characteristics, such as external [[gill]]s, which they retain as adults.

== Anatomy ==
=== External appearance ===
[[Image:P anguinus2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Olm.]]
The Olm's body is snakelike, 20-30&nbsp;[[centimeter]]s (8-12&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) long, with some specimens reaching up to 40 centimeters (16&nbsp;in).<ref name="WEB01">Weber A. (2000). ''Fish and amphibia''. In: Culver D.C. ''et al.'' (ed.): ''Ecosystems of the world: Subterranean Ecosystems'', pp. 109-132. Amsterdam: [[Elsevier]]</ref> The trunk is cylindrical, uniformly thick, and segmented with regularly spaced furrows at the myomere borders. The [[tail]] is relatively short, laterally flattened, and surrounded by a thin fin. The limbs are small and thin, with a reduced number of digits compared to other amphibians; the front legs have three digits instead of normal four, and the rear only two instead of normal five. Its body is covered by a thin layer of [[skin]], which contains very little [[biological pigment|"pigment"]] riboflavin <ref>Istenic L. in Ziegler I. (1974). ''Riboflavin as "pigment" in the skin of'' ''Proteus anguinus'' L. Naturwissenschaften '''12''': 686-687.</ref>, making it yellowish-white or pink in color.<ref name="animal"/> The internal organs can be seen shining through on the abdominal part of the body. The resemblance in color to human skin is the reason why the Proteus is called "human fish" in some languages. However, the Olm's skin retains the ability to produce [[melanin]]. When exposed to [[light]], it will gradually turn dark, and in some cases the [[larvae]] are also colored. Its [[pear]]-shaped head ends with short, dorsoventrally flattened snout. The mouth opening is small, with tiny [[teeth]] forming a [[sieve]] to keep larger particles inside the mouth. The nostrils are so small as to be imperceptible, but are placed somewhat [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Left_and_right_.28lateral.29.2C_and_medial|laterally]] near the end of the snout. The [[regression|regressed]] [[eye]]s are covered by a layer of skin. The Olm breathes with external [[gill]]s, forming two branched tufts at the back of the head.<ref name="animal"/> They are red in color because the oxygen-rich [[blood]] shows through the unpigmented skin. The Olm also has rudimentary [[lung]]s, but their role in respiration is only accessory. The sexes are largely alike in external appearance, with males having a  somewhat thicker [[cloaca]] than females.

===Sensory organs===
Cave dwelling animals have been prompted, among other adaptations, to develop and improve non-visual sensory systems in order to orient in and to adapt to permanently dark habitats <ref>Schlegel P.A., Briegleb W., Bulog B., Steinfartz S. (2006). ''Revue et nouvelles donn<U+00E9>es sur la sensitivit<U+00E9> a la lumiere et orientation non-visuelle chez Proteus anguinus, Calotriton asper et Desmognathus ochrophaeus (Amphibiens urodeles hypog<U+00E9>s)''. Bulletin de la Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> herp<U+00E9>tologique de France, '''118''', pp. 1-31. {{fr icon}}</ref>. The Olm's sensory system is also adapted to life in the subterranean aquatic environment. Unable to use [[vision]] for orientation, the Olm compensates with other senses, which are better developed than in amphibians living on the surface. It retains larval proportions, like a long, slender body and a large, flattened head, and is thus able to carry a larger number of [[sensory receptor]]s.

====Photoreceptors====
The eyes are regressed, but retain sensitivity to [[light]]. They lie deep below the [[Skin#dermis|dermis of the skin]], and are rarely visible except in some younger adults. Larvae have normal eyes, but development soon stops and they start regressing, finally atrophying after four months of development.<ref name="DUR01">Durand J.P. (1973).

'''28''', 193-208 {{fr icon}}</ref> The [[pineal body]] has also regressed photoreceptive cells,  retaining visual pigment like photoreceptive cells of the regressed eye.

[[Image:P anguinus-head1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Olm's front part of the head carries sensitive chemo-, mechano- and electroreceptors.]]

==== Chemoreceptors ====
The Olm is capable of sensing very low concentrations of organic compounds in the water. They are better at sensing both the quantity and quality of prey by smell than related amphibians.<ref name="HUP01">H<U+00FC>pop K. (2000). ''How do cave animals cope with the food scarcity in caves?''. In: Culver D.C. ''et al.'' (ed.): ''Ecosystems of the world: Subterranean Ecosystems'', pp. 159-188. Amsterdam: Elsevier</ref> The nasal [[epithelium]], located on the inner surface of the nasal cavity and in the [[Jacobson's organ]], is thicker than in other amphibians<ref name="DC01">Dumas P. in Chris B. (1998). ''The olfaction in Proteus anguinus''. Behavioural Processes '''43''': 107-113</ref>. The [[taste buds]] are in the mucous epithelium of the mouth, most of them on the upper side of the [[tongue]] and on the entrance to the gill cavities. Those in the oral cavity are used for tasting food, where those near the gills probably sense the chemical composition of water.

==== Mechano- and electroreceptors ====
The sensory [[epithelia]] of the [[inner ear]] are very specific differentiated and enables the Olm to receive [[sound]] waves in the water, as well as [[vibration]]s from the ground. The complex functional-morphological  orientation of the sensory cells  enables the animal to register the sound sources <ref>Bulog B. (1989). ''Differentiation of the inner ear sensory epithelia of Proteus anquinus (Urodela, Amphibia)''. Journal of Morphology, '''202''', pp. 325-338.</ref>,<ref name="BUL01">Bulog B. (1990). ''<U+010C>utilni organi oktavolateralnega sistema pri proteju Proteus anguinus (Urodela, Amphibia). I. Oti<U+010D>ni labirint'' (''Sense organs of the octavolateral system in proteus Proteus anguinus (Urodela, Amphibia). I. Otic labyrinth''). Biolo<U+0161>ki vestnik '''38''': 1-16 {{sl icon}}</ref> 
Little is known about the hearing of ''Proteus'', but occasionally observed reactions to sounds have indicated its possibility (Bulog, personal observ.). This suggested a hearing capability even and especially under water. As this animal stays neotenic throughout its long life span, it is only occasionally exposed to normal adult hearing in air which is probably also possible for Proteus as in most salamanders. Hence, it would be of adaptive value in caves, with no vision available, to profit from underwater hearing by recognizing of particular sounds and eventual localization of prey or other sound sources, i.e. acoustical orientation in general.  The ethological experiments indicate that the best hearing sensitivity of  ''Proteus'' is between 10 Hz and up to 15.000 Hz <ref>Bulog B. & Schlegel P. (2000). ''Functional morphology of the inner ear and underwater audiograms of Proteus anguinus (Amphibia, Urodela)''. Pfl<U+00FC>gers Arch '''439'''(3), suppl., pp. R165-R167.</ref>. The [[lateral line]] supplements inner ear sensitivity by registering low-frequency near by water displacements.

New type of sensory organs have been anayzed by light and electron microscopy on the head of ''Proteus'' and described as [[ampullary organ|ampullary organs]] <ref>Isteni<U+010D> L. & Bulog B. (1984). ''Some evidence for the ampullary organs in the European cave salamander Proteus anguinus'' (Urodela, Amphibia). Cell Tissue Res. '''235''', pp. 393-402.</ref>.
Like some other lower [[vertebrate]]s, the Olm has obviously the ability to register weak [[electric field]]s <ref name="SB01">Schegel P. & Bulog B. (1997). ''Population-specific behavioral electrosensitivity of the European blind cave salamander, Proteus anguinus''. Journal of Physiology (Paris) '''91''': 75-79</ref>. Some behavioral experiments suggest that the Olms may be use Earth's [[magnetic field]] to orient itself. Recently alignments of Proteus anguinus to natural and artificially modified magnetic fields were revealed<ref>Bulog B., Schlegel P. ''et al.'' (2002). ''Non-visual orientation and light-sensitivity in the blind cave salamander, Proteus anguinus'' (Amphibia, Caudata). In: Latella L., Mezzanotte E., Tarocco M. (eds.). 16th international symposium of biospeleology; 2002 Sep 8-15; Verona: Societ<U+00E9> Internationale de Biosp<U+00E9>ologie, pp. 31-32.</ref>. The experimental set-up was arranged by prof. Peter A. Schlegel. Animal's reactions, its movements, are observed by a infrared video camera. A round arena (an aquarium of 30 cm in diameter) is installed in the centre of the Helmholtz coils. This is a system of coils through which (by altering DC) a fairly homogeneous [[magnetic field]] around arena can be created and controlled.

==Ecology and life history==
=== Life history ===
[[Image:P anguinus1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Olm swims by snake-like bending of the body.]]
The Olm's [[embryo]]nic development  140 days, after which it takes another 14 years to reach sexual maturity. The larvae gain adult appearance after nearly four months, with the duration of development strongly correlating with water temperature.<ref name="DUR02">Durand J.P. & Delay B. (1981). ''Influence of temperature on the development of ''Proteus anguinus'' (Caudata: Proteidae) and relation with its habitat in the subterranean world''. Journal of Thermal Biology '''6'''(1): 53-57</ref> Unconfirmed historical observations of [[vivipary]] exist, but it has been shown that the females posses a [[gland]] that produces the egg casing, similar to those of [[fish]] and egg-laying amphibians.<ref name="ALJ01">Aljan<U+010D>i<U+010D> M., Bulog B. et al. (1993). ''Proteus - mysterious ruler of Karst darkness''. Ljubljana: Vitrium d.o.o. {{sl icon}}</ref> It was long thought that female Olm gave birth to live young at lower temperatures and laid eggs at higher, but rigorous observations have not confirmed that. The Olm appears to be [[ovipary|oviparous]].

The female lays up to 70 eggs, each about 12&nbsp;[[millimeter]]s (0.5&nbsp;in) in diameter, and places them between rocks, where they remain under her protection. The tadpoles are 2&nbsp;centimeters (0.8&nbsp;in) long when they hatch and live on [[yolk]] stored in the cells of the digestive tract for a month.<ref name="AA01">Aljan<U+010D>i<U+010D> G. and Aljan<U+010D>i<U+010D> M.

Development of the Olm and other [[troglobite]] amphibians is characterized by [[heterochrony]] - the animal does not undergo [[metamorphosis]] and instead retains larval features. The form of heterochrony in the Olm is [[neoteny]] - delayed [[somatic]] maturity with precosious reproductive maturity, i.e. this is phenomenon of obtaining reproductive maturity while retaining the larval external [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. In other amphibians, the metamorphosis is regulated by the [[hormone]] [[thyroxine]], excreted by the [[thyroid]] gland. The thyroid is normally developed and functioning in the Olm, so the lack of metamorphosis is due to the unresponsiveness of key [[tissue]]s to thyroxine.<ref name="LANG01">Langecker T.G. (2000). ''The effects of continuous darkness on cave ecology and caverniculous evolution''. In: Culver D.C. ''et al.'' (eds.): ''Ecosystems of the world: Subterranean Ecosystems'', pp. 135-157. Amsterdam: Elsevier</ref>
[[Image:P anguinus-head.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Unproportional elongated head with gills.]]
The Olm swims by eel-like twisting of its body, assisted only slightly by its poorly developed legs. It is a [[predator]]y animal, feeding on small [[crab]]s, [[snail]]s and occasionally [[insect]]s.<ref name="animal"/> It does not chew its food, instead swallowing it whole. The Olm is resistant to long-term starvation, an adaptation to its underground habitat. It can consume large amounts of food at once, and store nutrients as large deposits of [[lipid]]s and [[glycogen]] in the [[liver]]. When food is scarce, it reduces its activity and [[metabolism|metabolic rate]], and can also reabsorb its own tissues in severe cases. Controlled experiments have shown that an Olm can survive up to 10 years without food.<ref name="BUL02">Bulog B. (1994).

Olms are gregarious, and usually aggregate either under stones or in fissures.<ref name="GUI01">Guillaume O. (2000).

Reproduction has only been observed in captivity so far.<ref name="ALJ01">Aljan<U+010D>i<U+010D> M., Bulog B. et al. (1993). ''Proteus - mysterious ruler of Karst darkness''. Ljubljana: Vitrium d.o.o. {{sl icon}}</ref> Sexually mature males have swollen cloacas, brighter skin color, two lines at the side of the tail, and slightly curled fins. No such changes have been observed in the females. The male can start courtship even without the presence of a female. It chases other males away from the chosen area, and may then secrete a female-attracting [[pheromone]]. When the female approaches, he starts to circle around her and fan her with his tail. Then he starts to touch the female's body with his snout, and the female touches his cloaca with her snout. At that point, he starts to move forward with a twitching motion, and the female follows. He then deposits the [[spermatophore]], and the animals keep moving forward until the female hits it with her cloaca, after which she stops and stands still. The spermatophore sticks to her and the [[sperm]] cells swim inside her cloaca where they attempt to fertilize her eggs. The courtship ritual can be repeated several times over a couple of hours.<ref name="ALJ01">Aljan<U+010D>i<U+010D> M., Bulog B. et al. (1993). ''Proteus - mysterious ruler of Karst darkness''.

== Taxonomic history==
Olms from different cave systems differ substantially in body measurements, color and some microscopic characters. Earlier researchers used these differences to support the division into five different species, while modern herpetologists understand that external morphology is not reliable for amphibian systematics and can be extremely variable, depending on nourishment, illness, and other factors even varying among individuals in a single [[population]]. ''Proteus anguinus'' is now considered a single species. The length of the head is the most obvious difference among various populations - individuals from Sti<U+010D>na, Slovenia have shorter heads on average than those from Tr<U+017E>i<U+010D>, Slovenia and the [[Istria]]n peninsula, for example.

=== Black Proteus ===
The '''Black Proteus''' (''Proteus anguinus parkelj'' <small>Sket & Arntzen, 1994</small>) is the only recognized subspecies of the Olm, [[endemism|endemic]] to the underground waters near [[<U+010C>rnomelj]], Slovenia, an area smaller than 100&nbsp;[[square kilometer]]s (39&nbsp;[[Square mile|mi<U+00B2>]]). It was first found in 1986 by members of the [[Slovenian Karst Research Institute]] who were exploring the water from Dobli<U+010D>ice karst spring in the [[White Carniola|Bela krajina]] region.<ref name="ZSLO01">Sket B.

These features suggest that the Black ''Proteus'' has probably colonized uderground habitats more recently and still retains some nontroglomorphic characteristics.

== The history of research ==
The Olm is supposedly first pictured as 2 pairs of [[snake]]s with [[wing]]s, which could represent gills, in a [[relief]] on a [[Venetia]]n stone fountain, probably originating from Karst.

The first written mention of the Olm is in [[Janez Vajkard Valvasor]]'s ''[[The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola]]'' (1689) as a baby [[dragon]]. This was a reference to a folk story he did not really believe in. The first researcher to retrieve a live Olm was a [[physician]] and researcher from [[Idrija]], [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli|G.A. Scopoli]]; he sent dead specimens and drawings to colleagues and collectors.

[[Joseph Nicolai Laurenti]], though, was the first to briefly describe the Olm in 1768 and give it the scientific name ''Proteus anguinus''. It wasn't until the end of the century that [[Carl Franz Anton Ritter von Schreibers]] from the Naturhistorisches Museum of [[Vienna]] started to look into this animal's anatomy. The animals were sent to him by [[<U+017D>iga Zois]]. Schreibers presented his findings in 1801 to The [[Royal Society]] in [[London]], and later also in [[Paris]]. Soon the Olm started to gain wide recognition and attract significant attention, resulting in thousands of animals being sent to researchers and collectors worldwide. The basis of functional morphological investigations in Slovenia was set up by Prof. dr. [[Lili Isteni<U+010D>]] in the [[1980s]]. More than twenty years the Research Group for functional morphological Studies of the Vertebrates in the Department of Biology (Biotechnical Faculty, [[University of Ljubljana]]), is one of the leading groups studying the Olm under the guidance of Prof.dr. [[Boris Bulog]]  <ref>Bulog B. et al. (2003). ''Black Proteus: mysterious dweller of the Karst in Bela krajina ''. Ljubljana: TV Slovenia, Video tape.</ref>. There are also several cave laboratories in Europe, where the Olm have been introduced and are being studied. These are [[Moulis]] ([[France]]), [[Kent's Cavern]] ([[England]]), [[Han-sur-Lesse]] ([[Belgium]]) and [[Aggtelek]] ([[Hungary]]). They were also [[Introduced species|introduced]] into the [[Hermannsh<U+00F6>hle]] ([[Germany]]) and [[Grote Oliero]] ([[Italy]]) caves, where they still live today.

The Olm was used by [[Charles Darwin]] in his famous ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' as an example for the reduction of structures through disuse:<ref name="DARWIN01">Darwin C. (1859). ''On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life''. London: John Murray.</ref>

{{cquote|Far from feeling surprise that some of the cave-animals should be very anomalous...as is the case with blind Proteus with reference to the reptiles of Europe, I am only surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved, owing to the less severe competition to which the scanty inhabitants of these dark abodes will have been exposed.}}

== Conservation ==
[[Image:Proteus_anguinus_dis.png|thumb|right|Range map.]]
The Olm is extremely vulnerable to changes in its environment due to its adaptation to the specific conditions in caves. Water resources in the karst are extremely sensitive to all kinds of pollution <ref>Bulog B., Mihajl K. ''et al.'' (2002). ''Trace element concentrations in the tissues of Proteus anguinus (Amphibia, Caudata) and the surrounding environment''. Water air soil pollut., '''136'''(1-4), pp 147-163</ref>. The contamination of the karst underground waters is due to the large number of waste disposal sites leached by rainwater, as well as to the accidental overflow of various liquids. The reflection of such pollution in the karst underground waters depends on the type and quantity of pollutionants, and on the rock structure through which the waters penetrate.  Self-purification processes in the underground waters are not completely understood, but they are quite different from those in surface waters. Among the most serious chemical [[pollutants]] are chlorinated hydrocarbon [[pesticide]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, polychlorinated biphenyls ([[PCB]]s), which are or were used in a variety of industrial processes and in the manufacture of many kinds of materials; and  metals such as mercury, lead, cadmium, and arsenic. All of these substances persist in the environment, being slowly, if at all, degraded by natural processes. In addition, all are toxic to life if they accumulate in any appreciable quantity. Slovenian caves  became famous for the animals they contained and which could not be found elsewhere.  Due to its rarity the Olm is also popular among collectors, which can threaten the species by taking too many animals out of the habitat.

The Olm is included in Appendices II and IV of the [[EU Habitats Directive]] (92/43/EEC)<ref name="EEC01">''EU Habitats directive'' (1992).  [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/nature_conservation/eu_nature_legislation/habitats_directive/index_en.htm].</ref>. Appendix II seeks to preserve favorable conservation status in animal and [[plant]] species along with their [[habitat]]s by protecting the species or defining special areas of conservation. These areas of conservation form the [[Natura 2000]] network. Appendix IV further defines "animal and plant species of community interest in need of strict protection." Hunting or keeping a limited number of Olm is allowed only under strictly controlled circumstances, determined by local authorities.

The Olm was first protected in Slovenia in 1922 along with all cave fauna, but the protection was not effective and a substantial black market came into existence. In 1982 it was placed on a list of rare and endangered species. This list also had the effect of prohibiting trade of the species. After joining the [[European Union]], Slovenia had to establish mechanisms for protection of the species included in the EU Habitats Directive. The Olm is included in a Slovenian [[red list]] of endangered species<ref name="UL01">''Slovenian official gazette'' (2002).

In Croatia, the Olm is protected by the legislation designed to protect amphibians<ref name="NN01">''Pravilnik o za<U+0161>titi vodozemaca (2002)'', Dr<U+017E>avna uprava za za<U+0161>titu prirode i okoli<U+0161>a [http://www.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeno/1999/1435.htm]. {{hr icon}}</ref> - collecting is possible only for research purposes by permission of the National Administration for Nature and Environment Protection. Conservation status in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Montenegro]] has not yet been defined.

On the [[IUCN Red List]], the Olm is listed as vulnerable because of its fragmented and limited distribution and ever-decreasing population.<ref name="iucn"/>

==Importance to humans==
===Cultural significance===
[[Image:SVN001.JPG|200px|right|thumb|A coin depicting the Olm, in the old Slovenian national currency.]]
The Olm is a symbol of Slovenian natural heritage. The enthusiasm of scientists and the broader public about this inhabitant of Slovenian caves is still strong 300 years after its discovery. The Postojna cave is one of the birthplaces of [[speleology#cave_biology|speleobiology]] due to the Olm and other rare cave inhabitants. The image of the Olm contributes significantly to the fame of the Postojna cave, which Slovenia successfully utilizes for the promotion of [[eco-tourism]] in [[Postojna]] and other parts of Slovenian karst. Tours of the Postojna cave also include a tour around the speleobiological station - the Proteus [[vivarium]], showing different aspects of the cave environment.<ref name="vivarium">[http://www.postojnska-jama.si/?cat=81&lang=en&PHPSESSID=b59779a3f5babf443ef966f0264dc436 Destinacija Postojna]. Retrieved 7 June 2007.</ref>

The Olm was also depicted on one of the [[Slovenian Tolar]] coins, and was the namesake of ''Proteus'', the oldest Slovenian popular science magazine, first published in 1933.
