The 101st [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] took place on 26 March 1955. Held annually, the Boat Race is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]].  The race, in which the Cambridge crew was substantially heavier than their opponents and where there were more non-British participants than ever before, was umpired by former Oxford rower [[Gerald Ellison]].  Cambridge won by sixteen lengths, the second largest margin of victory in the history of the Boat Race, in a time of 19 minutes 10 seconds.  It was their second win in three years and took the overall record in the event to 55&ndash;45 in their favour.

==Background==
[[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues")<ref name=blues>{{Cite web | url = http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/06/theobserver | work = [[The Observer]] | title = Dark Blues aim to punch above their weight | date = 6 April 2003 | accessdate = 12 July 2014 }}</ref> and the [[University of Cambridge]] (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues").<ref name=blues/>  First held in 1829, the race takes place on the {{convert|4.2|mi|km|adj=on}} [[The Championship Course|Championship Course]] on the [[River Thames]] in southwest London.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 12 July 2014 | date = 25 March 2014 |title = University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | first = Oliver |last =Smith}}</ref>  The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and, as of 2014, broadcast worldwide.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|title=Former Winnipegger in winning Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race crew|date=6 April 2014|publisher=CBC News|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/former-winnipegger-in-winning-oxford-cambridge-boat-race-crew-1.2600176|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/tv-and-radio | title = TV and radio | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | accessdate = 12 July 2014}}</ref>  Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the [[The Boat Race 1954|1954 race]] by four-and-a-half lengths, while Cambridge led overall with 54 victories to Oxford's 45 (excluding the [[The Boat Race 1877|"dead heat" of 1877]]).<ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/results| publisher =The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 12 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url= http://theboatraces.org/classic-moments-the-1877-dead-heat | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Classic moments <U+2013> the 1877 dead heat | accessdate = 12 July 2014}}</ref>

Cambridge were coached by J. R. F. Best, G. Bogland-Wood, Thom Langton (who had rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1937|1937]] and [[The Boat Race 1938|1938 races]]), Derek Mays-Smith (a Blue in 1955 and 1956) and James Owen. Oxford's coaches were Christopher Davidge (who rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1949|1949]], [[The Boat Race 1951|1951]] and [[The Boat Race 1952|1952]] races and was non-rowing president for the [[The Boat Race 1951|1951 race]]), [[Hugh Edwards (rower)|Hugh Edwards]] (a Blue in 1926 and 1930), W. J. Llewellyn-Jones and A. D. Rowe (who had represented Oxford in the [[The Boat Race 1948|1948]] and 1949 races).<ref>Burnell, pp. 110&ndash;111</ref>  The race was umpired by former Oxford rower [[Gerald Ellison]], the [[Bishop of Willesden]], who had rowed for Oxford in the [[The Boat Race 1932|1932]] and [[The Boat Race 1933|1933 races]].<ref>Burnell, pp. 49, 74</ref>

Prior to the race, the rowing correspondent for ''The Times'' suggested "it must be rare for two Boat Race crews to be as dissimilar as are the Oxford and Cambridge crews" who were to race against one another.<ref name=marked>{{Cite news | title = Marked contrast between Boat Race crews| work = [[The Times]] | date = 26 March 1955 | page = 3 | issue = 53200}}</ref>  Oxford were the lighter crew yet demonstrated uniformity and excellent watermanship.  Cambridge's style was diverse but demonstrated a "tremendous zest for hard work and hard rowing."<ref name=marked/>

==Crews==
The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 13&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 2.5&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (83.5&nbsp;kg), {{convert|11|lb|kg|1}} per rower more than their opponents.  Six of the Oxford crew had previous Boat Race experience including their [[Bow (rowing)|bow]] James A. Gobbo.  Cambridge saw two rowers return, in bow D. K. Hill and number four K. A. Masser.<ref name=burn78/>  The race saw more non-British participants than ever before: Oxford's crew included four Australians in Gobbo, E. V. Vine, J. G. McLeod and [[Edward Pain]], while Cambridge's had two [[Harvard University]] rowers in P. du Bois and [[Robert A. G. Monks|Robert Monks]].<ref>Burnell, p. 39</ref>  Oxford's Pain was an Olympic bronze medallist in the [[Rowing at the 1952 Summer Olympics|men's eights]] at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/pa/ted-pain-1.html | publisher = [[Sports Reference]] | title = Ted Pain, Bio, Stats, and Results | accessdate = 13 February 2015}}</ref>

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]] along which the Boat Race is contested]]
Oxford won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Cambridge.<ref name=burn78>Burnell, p. 78</ref>  The umpire Ellison started the race at 2:20&nbsp;p.m. whereupon Oxford made the better start, [[stroke rate|rating]] 40 strokes per minute, and taking a slight lead.<ref name=great/>  Maintaining the higher stroke rate, the Dark Blues passed Craven Steps with a canvas-length lead in a record time.  Taking advantage of the bend in the river, Cambridge first drew level before holding a quarter-length lead by the time the crews passed the Mile Post.  By [[Harrods Furniture Depository]] the lead was just back to a canvas before a mistake in the steering from Oxford's [[Coxswain (rowing)|cox]] Watson on the approach to [[Hammersmith Bridge]] saw Cambridge leading by a few feet.  A spurt from Oxford's stroke G. Sorrell went unanswered by his crew, and in response, the Light Blue stroke pushed on, taking the Cambridge boat away.  By [[Chiswick Eyot]] the Light Blues held a three-length lead which they extended to over five lengths by Chiswick Steps.<ref name=sudden>{{Cite news | title = Sudden end to the Boat Race: Oxford fade after Hammersmith Bridge| work = [[The Times]] | page = 11| date = 28 March 1955 | issue = 53200}}</ref>

Rough water in Corney Reach meant both crews had reduced to 28 strokes per minute but Oxford were tiring:  their number six McLeod "stopped rowing ... he kept some sort of time, but barely dipping his blade into the water".<ref name=sudden/>  The rowing correspondent for ''The Manchester Guardian'' suggested that he had "got his oar buried, was pounded in the stomach by its handle and virtually stopped rowing".<ref name=great/>  Cambridge passed below [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]] thirty seconds ahead and had reduced their rating to 26 strokes per minute, 6 fewer than Oxford who continued to struggle.<ref name=sudden/>  Cambridge won by sixteen lengths, the second largest margin of victory in the history of the Boat Race, bettered only by their twenty-length victory in the [[The Boat Race 1900|1900 race]].<ref name=great>{{Cite news | title = Great win by Cambridge, but Oxford never gave up | work = [[The Manchester Guardian]] | date = 28 March 1955 | page = 4}}</ref>  The winning time was 19 minutes 10 seconds.  It was their second win in three years and took the overall record in the event to 55&ndash;45 in their favour.<ref name=results/>
