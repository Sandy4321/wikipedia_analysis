'''Wintjiya Napaltjarri''' (born between ca. 1923 to 1934) (also spelt '''Wentjiya''', '''Wintjia''' or '''Wentja'''), and also known as '''Wintjia Napaltjarri No. 1''',<ref name="Birnberg2212"/> is a [[Pintupi language|Pintupi]]-speaking [[Indigenous Australian|Indigenous]] artist from [[Australia|Australia's]] [[Western Desert cultural bloc|Western Desert]] region. She is the sister of artist [[Tjunkiya Napaltjarri]]; both were wives of Toba Tjakamarra, with whom Wintjiya had five children.

Wintjiya's involvement in [[contemporary Indigenous Australian art]] began in 1994 at [[Haasts Bluff, Northern Territory|Haasts Bluff]], when she participated in a group painting project and in the creation of [[batik]] fabrics. She has also been a printmaker, using [[drypoint]] etching. Her paintings typically use an [[iconography]] that represents the eggs of the flying ant (''[[waturnuma]]'') and [[hair-string skirt]]s (''nyimparra''). Her palette generally involves strong red or black against a white background.

A finalist in the 2007 and 2008 [[National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award]]s, Wintjiya's work is held in several of Australia's public collections including the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]], the [[Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory]], the [[National Gallery of Australia]] and the [[National Gallery of Victoria]].

[[Napaljarri (skin name)|Napaljarri]] (in [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]]) or Napaltjarri (in Western Desert dialects) is a [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|skin name]], one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the [[kinship system]] of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems. Although often used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans.<ref name="CLC">{{cite web|url=http://www.clc.org.au/People_Culture/kinship/kinship.html|title=Kinship and skin names|work=People and culture|publisher=Central Land Council|accessdate=23 October 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clc.org.au%2FPeople_Culture%2Fkinship%2Fkinship.html&date=2010-10-11|archivedate=12 October 2010}}</ref><ref name="de Brabander">{{cite book|last=De Brabander|first=Dallas|title=[[Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia]]|editor=David Horton|publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|location=Canberra, ACT|year=1994|volume=2|page=977|chapter=Sections|isbn=978-0-85575-234-7}}</ref> Thus Wintjiya is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers.

Wintjiya came from an area north-west<ref name="Birnberg2212"/> or north-east<ref name="Johnson307"/> of Wa<u>l</u>ungurru (the [[Pintupi language|Pintupi-language]] name for [[Kintore, Northern Territory]]). Johnson reports that Wintjiya was born at Mulparingya, "a swamp and spring to the northeast of Kintore", west of [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]]. As was the case for a number of artists from the region, Wintjiya's family walked in to the [[Haasts Bluff, Northern Territory|Haasts Bluff]] settlement in the 1950s, moving to [[Papunya, Northern Territory|Papunya]] in the 1960s. In 1981, Kintore was established and the family moved there.<ref name="Birnberg2212"/><ref name="Johnson307"/> Her native language is Pintupi, and she speaks almost no English.<ref name="Strocchi08"/> She is the sister of artist [[Tjunkiya Napaltjarri]],<ref name="SunMoon">{{cite book|last=Perkins|first=Hetti|coauthors=Margie West|title=One Sun One Moon: Aboriginal Art in Australia|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|location=Sydney, NSW|year=2007|pages=187<U+2013>188|ISBN=978-0-7347-6360-0}}</ref> the two women being the second and third wives of Toba Tjakamarra, father (by his first wife, Nganyima Napaltjarri) of one of the prominent founders of the [[Papunya Tula]] art movement, [[Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula]].<ref name="Johnson307"/><ref name="Johnson305"/> Wintjiya and Toba had five children: sons Bundy (born 1953) and Lindsay (born 1961 and now deceased); and daughters Rubilee (born 1955), Claire (born 1958) and Eileen (born 1960).

===Background===

Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began in 1971 when Indigenous men at Papunya created murals and canvases using western art materials, assisted by teacher [[Geoffrey Bardon]].<ref name="Bardon">{{cite book|last=Bardon|first=Geoffrey|coauthors=James Bardon|title=Papunya <U+2013> A place made after the story: The beginnings of the Western Desert painting movement|publisher=Miegunyah Press & University of Melbourne|location=Melbourne, VIC|year=2007|ISBN=978-0-522-85434-3}}</ref> Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly after the introduction of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983.<ref name="Dussart06">{{cite journal|last=Dussart|first=Francoise|year=2006|title=Canvassing identities: reflecting on the acrylic art movement in an Australian Aboriginal settlement|journal=Aboriginal History|volume=30|pages=156<U+2013>168}}</ref> By the 1980s and '90s, such work was being exhibited internationally.<ref name="Morphy99">{{cite book|last=Morphy|first=Howard|title=Aboriginal Art|publisher=Phaidon|location=London|year=1999|pages=261<U+2013>316|ISBN=0-7148-3752-0}}</ref> The first artists, including all of the founders of the [[Papunya Tula]] artists' company, were men, and there was resistance among the Pintupi men of central Australia to women also painting.<ref name="Strocchi06">{{cite journal|last=Strocchi|first=Marina|year=2006|title=Minyma Tjukurrpa: Kintore / Haasts Bluff Canvas Project: Dancing women to famous painters|journal=[[Artlink Magazine]]|volume=26|issue=4}}</ref> However, many of the women wished to participate, and in the 1990s many of them began to paint.

===Career===
Since the 1970s Wintjiya had created artefacts such as ''[[Erythrina vespertilio|ininti]]'' seed necklaces, mats and baskets, using traditional artistic techniques including weaving of [[Triodia (plant genus)|spinifex]] grass.<ref name="Ryan08">{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Judith|title=Across the Desert: Aboriginal batik from Central Australia|year=2008|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|location=Melbourne, VIC|isbn=978-0-7241-0299-0|page=164|chapter=Biographies and checklist}}</ref> When the women of Kintore, including sisters Wintjiya and Tjunkiya, started creating canvasses, their works bore little resemblance to those of their male peers (who had been painting for some years).<ref name="SunMoon"/> Wintjiya's first efforts were collaborative, as one of a group of women who created murals on the Kintore Women's Centre walls in 1992. She then joined a painting camp with other women from Kintore and Haasts Bluff to produce "a series of very large collaborative canvases of the group's shared [[dreaming (spirituality)|Dreamings]]"<ref name="Johnson307"/> (dreamings are stories used to pass "important knowledge, cultural values and belief systems" from generation to generation).<ref name="Culture">{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/indigenous/dreamtime/|title=The Dreaming|year=2008|work=Culture Portal|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=12 January 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070829110707/http://cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/indigenous/dreamtime/|archivedate=29 August 2007}}</ref> Twenty-five women were involved in planning the works, which included three canvases that were {{convert|3|m}} square, as well as two that were {{convert|3|by|1.5|m}}; Tjunkiya and Wintjiya performed a ceremonial dance as part of the preparations.<ref name="Strocchi06"/> Wintjiya and her sister were determined to participate in the project despite [[cataract]]s interfering with their vision.<ref name="Finnane">{{cite journal|last=Finnane|first=Kieran|year=1997|title=From first canvas to national collections in three years|journal=Artlink Magazine|volume=17|issue=4|url=http://www.artlink.com.au/articles.cfm?id=2820 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5stcdcAq5 |archivedate=20 September 2010}}</ref> As was the case for [[Makinti Napanangka]], an operation to remove cataracts resulted in a new brightness to Wintjiya's compositions.<ref name="Johnson307"/> Sources differ on when Wintjiya and her sister Tjunkiya had their cataracts removed: Johnson suggests 1999, but art centre coordinator Marina Strocchi, who worked closely with the women, states that it was 1994.<ref name="Strocchi08">{{cite book|last=Strocchi|first=Marina|editor=Judith Ryan|title=Across the Desert: Aboriginal batik from Central Australia|year=2008|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|location=Melbourne, VIC|isbn=978-0-7241-0299-0|pages=130<U+2013>134|chapter=Before Painting: The Kintore Batiks}}</ref> In the early 2000s Wintjiya and her sister painted at Kintore, but in 2008 they were working from their home: "the widows' camp ouside her 'son' Turkey Tolson's former residence".<ref name="Johnson307"/><ref name="Johnson305">{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Vivien|title=Lives of the Papunya Tula Artists|publisher=IAD Press|location=Alice Springs, NT|year=2008|page=305|ISBN=978-1-86465-090-7}}</ref> 

Tjunkiya and her sister Wintjiya did not confine their activities to painting canvases. In 2001 the National Gallery of Victoria purchased a collaborative [[batik]], created by the sisters in cooperation with several other artists, together with one completed by Wintjiya alone.<ref name="NGV02">{{cite book|last=Council of Trustees of the National Gallery of Victoria|title=Annual Report 2001-2002|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|location=Melbourne, VIC|year=2002|page=72|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/11935/ngv_corp_annualreport_2001_02_3.pdf|accessdate=26 August 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ngv.vic.gov.au%2F__data%2Fassets%2Fpdf_file%2F0019%2F11935%2Fngv_corp_annualreport_2001_02_3.pdf&date=2010-10-20 |archivedate=21 October 2010}}</ref> These works were the product of a batik workshop run for the women of Haasts Bluff by [[Government of the Northern Territory|Northern Territory Education Department]] staff Jill Squires and Therese Honan in the months following June 1994. The works, including several by Wintjiya, were not completed until 1995. Circular markings, used by Wintjiya in both these batiks and her subsequent paintings, represent the eggs of the flying ant (''waturnuma''), one of the main subjects of her art. She also portrays "tree-like organic motifs" and representations of hair-string skirts (''nyimparra'').<ref name="Strocchi08"/> The sisters also gained experience with [[drypoint]] etching; works produced by Wintjiya in 2004 <U+2013> ''Watiyawanu'' and ''Nyimpara'' <U+2013> are held by the [[National Gallery of Australia]].<ref name="NGA1">{{cite web|url=http://artsearch.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=160799|title=Nyimpara 2004|last=Napaltjarri|first=Wintjiya|work=Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|accessdate=26 August 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fartsearch.nga.gov.au%2FDetail.cfm%3FIRN%3D160799&date=2010-10-20 |archivedate=21 October 2010 }}</ref><ref name="NGA2">{{cite web|url=http://artsearch.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=160797|title=Watiyawanu 2004|last=Napaltjarri|first=Wintjiya|work=Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|accessdate=26 August 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fartsearch.nga.gov.au%2FDetail.cfm%3FIRN%3D160797&date=2010-10-20 |archivedate=21 October 2010 }}</ref>

Wintjiya's work was included in a survey of the history of Papunya Tula painting hosted by [[Flinders University]] in the late 1990s. Reviewing the exhibition, Christine Nicholls remarked of Wintjiya's ''Watanuma'' that it was a germinal painting, with fine use of muted colour, and showed sensitivity to the relationships between objects and spaces represented in the work.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nicholls|first=Christine|year=1999|title=Twenty Five Years and Beyond: Papunya Tula Painting|journal=Artlink Magazine|volume=19|issue=4|url=http://www.artlink.com.au/articles.cfm?id=72 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060821235247/http://artlink.com.au/articles.cfm?id=72 |archivedate=21 August 2010}}</ref> Likewise, Marina Strocchi has noted the contrast between some of the subtle colours used in batik and Wintjiya's characteristic painting palette, which is "almost exclusively stark white with black or red".<ref name="Strocchi08"/> Hetti Perkins and Margie West have suggested that in paintings by Kintore women artists such as Wintjiya and Tjunkiya, "the viscosity of the painting's surface seems to mimic the generous application of body paint in women's ceremonies".<ref name="SunMoon"/>

Wintjiya's painting ''Rock holes west of Kintore'' was a finalist in the 2007 [[National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award]].<ref name="NATSIAA07">{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/museums/exhibitions/natsiaa/pdf/sales_list.pdf|title=Sales information|year=2007|work=National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards|publisher=Museums and Art Galleries of the Northern Territory|accessdate=14 October 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tPg9aRWO |archivedate=11 October 2010}}</ref> Another of her works, ''Country west of Kintore'', was accepted as a finalist in 2008.<ref name="NATSIAA08">{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/museums/exhibitions/natsiaa/25/pdf/sales_list.pdf|title=Sales information|year=2008|work=25th National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards|publisher=Museums and Art Galleries of the Northern Territory|accessdate=14 October 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nJNVFDNO |archivedate=5 February 2010}}</ref> Works by Wintjiya have appeared in many significant exhibitions including: ''Papunya Women'' group exhibition (Utopia Art Gallery, Sydney, 1996);<ref name="Win2AGNSW"/> ''Raiki Wara: Long Cloth from Aboriginal Australia and the Torres Strait'' ([[National Gallery of Victoria]] 1998<U+2013>99); ''Twenty-five Years and Beyond: Papunya Tula Painting'' ([[Flinders University]] Art Museum, 1999); ''Papunya Tula: Genesis and Genius'' ([[Art Gallery of New South Wales]], 2000) and ''Land Marks'' (National Gallery of Victoria, 2006). Her first solo exhibition was at Wolloongabba Art Gallery in Brisbane in 2005,<ref name="Ryan08"/> while in 2010 there was one at a Melbourne gallery.
