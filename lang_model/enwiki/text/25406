'''Benjamin Stillingfleet''' (1702<U+2013>1771) was a botanist, translator and author. He is said to be the first [[Blue Stockings Society|Blue Stocking]], a phrase from which is derived the term [[wikt:bluestocking|bluestocking]] now used to describe a learned woman.<ref name=dyk/>

==Life==
Benjamin Stillingfleet was born in [[Wood Norton, Norfolk|Wood Norton]], Norfolk in 1702 to Mary Ann and [[Edward Stillingfleet (physician)|Edward Stillingfleet]], a physician. He was one of four children, but the only son.<ref name=odnb>I. D.

He served as a tutor to bring in income. He was tutor to his relative [[William Windham, Sr.|William Windham]] at [[Felbrigg Hall]] and he taught him from the age of seven to twenty. He then  set out to accompany William Windham on the [[Grand Tour]]<ref>{{cite journal|date=29 May 1948|title=Benjamin Stillingfleet|journal=Notes and Queries|pages=224|url=http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/193/11/224-b}}</ref> returning several years later in 1742. Whilst in Switzerland they had organised over several winters a set of [[pantomimes]] using other "tourists" as cast helpers and audience. Stillingfleet was in charge of the music and the scenery. This group was known as the "Common Room". During the summers the same group would set out on scientific explorations finding the undocumented glaciers of the Alps.

Finally they returned to England, Stillingfleet, now out of work, was awarded a pension of 100 pounds per year for the next seven years by the Windham family. This gratitude was not entirely undeserved.  Windham was to become a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1744 based on the explorations that he, Stillingfleet (and others) had made of glaciers in Switzerland and his mathematical abilities which Stillingfleet had tutored.

Stillingfleet was again noted for his contribution when [[William Hudson (botanist)|William Hudson]] FRS was lauded for his publication of ''Flora Anglica'' in 1761, said to be the first application of [[Linnean]] principles to botany in England.<ref>{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Hudson, William (1730?-1793)}}</ref> Others however have pointed to Stillingfleet's earlier work as the first.<ref name=odnb/>

A society was founded in the early 1750s by [[Elizabeth Montagu]] , [[Elizabeth Vesey]] and others as a literary discussion group primarily for women. The society was noted for wanting conversation and did not encourage card playing. They invited various people to attend including [[Anna Letitia Barbauld]], [[Catharine Macaulay]], [[Elizabeth Griffith]], [[Hannah More]], [[Elizabeth Ann Linley]], [[Charlotte Lennox]]<ref name=npg/> and Stillingfleet. One story tells that Stillingfleet was not rich enough to have the proper formal dress, which included black [[silk]] [[stocking]]s, so he attended in everyday blue [[worsted]] stockings. [[James Boswell]] records that during a period of poor conversation when Stillingfleet was absent that it was remarked that they were "nowhere without blue stockings".<ref name=odnb/> The term came to refer to the informal quality of the gatherings and the emphasis on conversation over fashion.<ref name=Schnorrenberg>Barbara Brandon Schnorrenberg, <U+201C>[http://www.oxforddnb.com.proxy.hil.unb.ca/view/article/19014 Montagu , Elizabeth (1718<U+2013>1800)],<U+201D> ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Ed. H. C. G. Matthew and Brian Harrison. Oxford: OUP, 2004. 22 Apr. 2007.</ref> The word ''bluestocking'' today is used to mean any learned woman. It should be pointed out that other derivations of the term have also been suggested.

Stillingfleet died at his lodgings in [[Piccadilly]] and his papers were burnt following his own instructions.<ref name=odnb/> He left his estate to his one remaining sister. A monument was erected only after some years to his memory at nearby St. James church by his nephew.

==Legacy==
Stillingfleet's habits are said to be the derivation of the name of the [[Blue Stockings Society]]. The phrase is the derivation of the English word [[wikt:bluestocking|bluestocking]] which is applied to a learned or intellectual woman. The word by [[Loan translation]] is also used in German as ''Blaustrumpf'', in Dutch as ''blauwkous'' and in French as ''bas-bleu''.<ref name=dyk>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bluestocking Bluestocking], derivation and etymology at Dictionary.com, accessed February 2010</ref>
