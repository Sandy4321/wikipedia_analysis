==Gameplay==
The player controls a snowboarder in one of six modes. 1080<U+00B0> has two trick modes (trick attack and contest),<ref>{{Cite book | title=1080 Snowboarding Instruction Booklet | location=Japan | publisher=Nintendo | year=1998 | pages=p.&nbsp;15<U+2013>16}}</ref> three race modes (race, time attack, and multiplayer),<ref>{{Cite book | title=1080 Snowboarding Instruction Booklet | location=Japan | publisher=Nintendo | year=1998 | pages=pp.&nbsp;12<U+2013>15,&nbsp;17}}</ref> a training mode, and an options mode.<ref>{{Cite book | title=1080 Snowboarding Instruction Booklet | location=Japan | publisher=Nintendo | year=1998 | pages=pp.&nbsp;4<U+2013>6}}</ref> The objective of the game is either to arrive quickly at a level's finish line or to receive maximum points for trick combinations.

===Trick modes===
In ''1080<U+00B0>'''s two trick modes, trick attack and contest, players accrue points from completed tricks.<ref name="All Overview">{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&sql=1:7501~T0|title=1080<U+00B0> Snowboarding|publisher=All Game Guide|accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref>  In contest mode, players perform tricks and snowboard past flags for points. Trick attack mode requires players to perform a series of tricks throughout a designated level. The game features 25 tricks, all of which are performed by using a combination of circular positions of the [[Nintendo 64 controller|control stick]], the R button, and the B button; point values are allocated based on complexity and required time.<ref name="All Overview" /> The two types of tricks are grab tricks, in which the board is grabbed in a specific way, or spin tricks, in which the snowboarder spins the board a certain number of degrees.<ref name="IGN rev">{{cite web |url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/152/152225p1.html |title=1080<U+00B0> Snowboarding |accessdate=2007-04-17 |last=Casamassina |first=Matt |authorlink=Matt Casamassina |date=[[1998-04-02]] |publisher=IGN}}</ref> The 1080<U+00B0> spin requires nine actions, the most of any trick in the game.<ref name="quick ref">Operation Card for ''1080<U+00B0> Snowboarding''.

===Race modes===
''1080<U+00B0>'' has three race modes; in these modes, victory can be achieved by taking separate routes within a course and balancing the snowboarder after a jump to avoid speed loss.<ref name="GameRev" /> Tricks are scored in race modes, but do not count toward victory.<ref name="GameRev">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/n64/1080_snowboarding|title=1080 Snowboarding - N64|accessdate=2007-04-17|date=[[2004-06-06]] |publisher=Game Revolution}}</ref> 

In match race mode, the player competes in a series of races against [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]-controlled snowboarders.<ref>{{Cite book | title=1080 Snowboarding Instruction Booklet | location=Japan | publisher=Nintendo | year=1998 | pages=p.&nbsp;12}}</ref> The game times the player throughout the level and players receive a damage meter which fills if the snowboarder falls down or is knocked over. The difficulty level in match races can be set to easy, medium, or hard, adjusting the complexity and number of races. If the player fails at defeating an AI competitor, they must retire. The player is given three chances to beat the computer before the game is over.<ref name="GameRev" /><ref>{{Cite book | title=1080 Snowboarding Instruction Booklet | location=Japan | publisher=Nintendo | year=1998 | pages=pp.&nbsp;12<U+2013>13}}</ref>

===Characters===
[[Image:Characters.PNG|lright|thumb|The characters of 1080<U+00B0> from left to right: Rob Haywood, Akari Hayami, Ricky Winterborn, Kensuke Kimachi, and Dion Blaster<ref name=japan />]]
Players may initially choose from five snowboarding characters: two from Japan, and one each from Canada, America, and the United Kingdom. Each snowboarder has different abilities and is suited for different levels and modes, since each has varying statistics in fields such as technique, speed, and weight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/techtvvault/features/10388/1080_Snowboarding_n64.html|title=1080 Snowboarding (n64)|date=[[1999-04-20]]|publisher=G4|accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref><ref name="Prima Guide" /> Three additional snowboarders are unlocked by completing certain game levels and modes.<ref name="Prima Guide" /> Eight snowboards are initially available for every character, and one additional snowboard may be unlocked later in the game. Each board also excels in different situations, since each have different strengths in categories such as balance and edge control.<ref name="Prima Guide">{{cite web|url=http://guidesarchive.ign.com/guides/2225/|publisher=Prima Games|title=1080<U+00B0> Snowboarding|date=1999-12-09|accessdate=2007-06-03}}</ref>

==Development==
''1080<U+00B0>'''s release was announced on November 21, 1997 at Nintendo's [[SpaceWorld]] trade show; the game's working title was then ''Vertical Edge Snowboarding''.<ref name="Announced">{{cite web|url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/061/061481p1.html|title=Head for the Slopes|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=IGN Staff|date=[[1997-11-21]]|accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref> ''1080<U+00B0>'' was one of several snowboarding games released for the Nintendo 64 in 1998, others being ''[[Big Mountain 2000]]'' and ''[[Snowboard Kids]]''.<ref name="Announced" /> Before the game's release, journalists were able to play ''1080<U+00B0>'' at the January 1998 Nintendo Gamers' Summit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/061/061751p1.html|title=1080 Shreds the Competition|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=IGN Staff|date=[[1998-01-30]]|accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref>

''1080<U+00B0>'' was programmed by Englishmen Giles Goddard and Colin Reed, developed and published by [[Nintendo]], and produced by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]].<ref name="credits" /> Goddard and Reed had previously programmed ''[[Wave Race 64]]'',<ref name="tomato">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/g/nintendo_64/1080_snowboarding/overview.php|title=1080 Snowboarding |accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> which sold over a million copies and was a huge commercial success. Its sequel, ''[[Wave Race: Blue Storm]]'', would feature characters from ''1080<U+00B0>''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/15332/page_9.html | title=Wave Race: Blue Storm Characters | last=Schneider | first=Peer | authorlink=Peer Schneider | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2007-06-03 | pages=p.&nbsp;9}}</ref>

When developing ''1080<U+00B0>'', Goddard and Reed used a technique called "skinning" to eliminate joints between the polygons composing the characters. Their programming used a combination of standard animation and [[inverse kinematics]], creating characters whose appearance during collisions is affected what object is hit, what direction the collision occurs in, and the speed at which the collision takes place.<ref name="interview" /> [[Tommy Hilfiger]] outfits and Lamar snowboards appear throughout ''1080<U+00B0>'' as [[product placement]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cheats.gamespy.com/nintendo-64/1080-snowboarding/|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|accessdate=2007-05-15|title=1080 Snowboarding (N64)}}</ref> ''1080<U+00B0>''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s soundtrack of "techno and rappy beats" with "thrashy, foozed-out vocals" was composed by [[Kenta Nagata]],<ref name="credits" /><ref name="IGN rev" /> who also composed soundtracks for ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'' and other Nintendo games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/n64/driving/mariokart64/tech_info.html|title=Mario Kart 64 Tech Info|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref>

Critics generally praised ''1080<U+00B0>'', which had an average score of 88/100 on [[Metacritic]] and 90% on [[Game Rankings]].<ref name="GameRankings">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/196500.asp|title=1080 Snowboarding|publisher=[[Game Rankings]]|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/n64/1080snowboarding|title=1080<U+00B0> Snowboarding |accessdate=2007-04-17|publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref> It won the [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences]]' 1999 Console Sports Game of the Year award<ref name="Award">{{cite web|url=http://www.interactive.org/awards.php?winners&year=1999&cat=199925#199925|title=Console Sports Game of the Year|publisher=Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences|accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref> and was called "one of the best values in both sports and racing gaming" by Gamespot.<ref name="GameSpot review" /> ''1080<U+00B0>'' has been perceived to be a leader among snowboarding titles at the time since it was "so good...that it took publishing giant [[Electronic Arts]] several years and a far more powerful console to give it solid competition" in the form of the ''[[SSX (series)|SSX]]'' franchise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/442/442561p1.html|title=1080: Avalanche|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2007-05-16|last=Casamassina|first=Matt|date=[[2003-12-01]]}}</ref> ''[[Edge]]'' hailed it as the "most convincing videogame emulation of the snowboarding experience so far" with an "atmosphere of sobriety" unlike any other Nintendo game at the time.<ref name="Edge Review" /> 

The game's graphics were of the highest quality for the [[Nintendo 64]] at the time.<ref name="Edge Review">{{Citation|title =1080<U+00B0> Snowboarding |periodical=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher = [[Future Publishing]]|pages = pp.&nbsp;86<U+2013>88|date = April 1998 | issue=57}}</ref><ref name="CVG" /> Critics praised general aspects of the game's graphics such as their crispness, detail, smoothness, and lack of polygon dropout.<ref name="Gamebits"/><ref name="GameSpot review">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/n64/sports/1080snowboarding/review.html |title=1080:TenEighty Snowboarding |accessdate=2007-04-17 |last=Smith |first=Josh |date=[[1998-05-25]] |publisher=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> More specifically, critics praised the game's camera use, the game's "very solid" physics model,<ref name="GameSpot review" /> the impression of racers' speed, and the game's snow effects (sun reflected in the snow as appropriate, and fluffy snow and packed snow appeared and behaved differently).<ref name="IGN rev" /><ref name="Gamebits">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamebits.net/n64/teneight/ |title=1080 SNOWBOARDING |accessdate=2007-04-17 |last=Gagne |first=Ken  |date=[[1998-05-11]] |publisher=Gamebits}}</ref>  Graphical faults identified by critics included occasional pop-up, misplaced shadows, and lag when racers passed through on-track trees;<ref name="IGN rev" /> these problems were generally identified as minor.<ref name="GameSpot review" /> 

Although writing a positive review, ''Edge'' found faults in the game's AI; they asserted ''1080<U+00B0>'' suffered from <U+201C>cheating<U+201D> CPU opponents.<ref name="Edge Review" /> They criticized the AI's simplicity and ability to quickly catch up to the player near the end of a race; they also noted the AI's "limited series of predetermined routes" and the possibility of a player learning where and when an AI falls over, "offering an opportunity to pass [the computer], but conveying little satisfaction with it."<ref name="Edge Review" /> ''Edge'' also stated that the PAL release delay "is frankly ludicrous."<ref name="PAL Edge Review"> {{Citation |title =1080<U+00B0> Snowboarding |periodical=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher = [[Future Publishing]]|pages = p.&nbsp;96|date = September 1998 | issue=62}}</ref> They believed that, due to Nintendo's slump of noteworthy releases, "any quality title is likely to top the charts with little difficulty."<ref name="PAL Edge Review" />

[[Allgame]] considered the "highly technical" control scheme of ''1080<U+00B0>'' one of the game's strengths despite its initial difficulty.<ref name="All Game Rev">{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&sql=1:7501~T1 |title=1080<U+00B0> Snowboarding |accessdate=2007-04-17|last=Sackenheim |first=Shawn |publisher=[[Allgame]]}}</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games|CVG]]'' positively reviewed the control scheme, but disagreed on its difficulty, noting "the controls have been implemented so brilliantly that you're able to play perfectly well with just one hand on the stick and Z button."<ref name="CVG">{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=8317|title=1080 Snowboarding|date=2001-08-15|first=Alex|last=Constantides| accessdate=2007-12-26|publisher=Computer and Video Games}}</ref> GameSpot called the game's control "thoroughly involving" and said that "[t]he crouch move alone - which makes for supertight turns - makes this fun to play."<ref name="GameSpot review" />  The music was also generally praised, with IGN calling it "a shining example of what can be achieved on the format"<ref name="IGN rev" /> and Allgame calling it "one of the best N64 soundtracks to date."<ref name="All Game Rev" /> ''Gamebits'', however, criticized the soundtrack as "minimal" and insufficient.<ref name="Gamebits" /> ''1080<U+00B0>'''s sound effects were critically praised as "some perfect sound effects" and "nice as well."<ref name="All Game Rev" /><ref name="Gamebits" />
[[Image:1080 trophy.PNG|thumb|The 1080<U+00B0> Snowboarding trophy in [[Super Smash Bros Melee]]]]
In a retrospective review by the ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' in 2006, Steve Jarratt commented that ''1080<U+00B0>'' "boasted the best videogame representation of snow," and was complimented by "swooshy" sound effects."<ref name="retrospective" >{{cite news |last=Jarratt |first=Steve |year=2006 |month=May |work=Official Nintendo Magazine||title=What do you mean, you've never played 1080<U+00B0> Snowboarding|pages=19 |accessdate=2007-12-03}}</ref> Positive comments were also made about handling and the quality of the multiplayer, despite its age.<ref name="retrospective" /> In summary, Jarratt believed "this was a straight-up snowboarder, stunt-free but fast and fun."
