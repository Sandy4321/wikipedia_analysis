The '''United Federation of Teachers''' ('''UFT''') is the [[labor union]] that represents most [[education|educators]] in [[New York City]] [[public schools]]. [[As of 2005]], there were about 74,000 teachers and 17,000 paraprofessionals in the union, as well as about 32,000 retired members. It is affiliated with the [[American Federation of Teachers]], the [[AFL-CIO]] and the [[Central Labor Council]]. It is also the largest member of [[New York State United Teachers]].

== History ==
Two previous unions of New York schoolteachers, the Teachers Union, founded in [[1916]], and the Teachers Guild, formed in [[1935]] failed to gather widespread enrollment or support. Many of the early leaders were [[pacifism|pacifists]] or [[socialism|socialists]] and viewed with suspicion. The ethnically and ideologically heterogeneous nature of the teaching community and of New Yorkers as a whole also made the creation of a single organized body difficult. 

The UFT was founded in [[1960]], largely in response to perceived unfairness in the educational system's treatment of teachers. Pensions only were awarded to retired teachers over 65 or with 35 years of service. Female teachers faced two years of mandatory unpaid maternity leave after giving birth. Principals could discipline or fire teachers with almost no oversight. The schools, experiencing a massive influx of [[Baby Boomer]] students, often were on double or triple session. Despite being college-educated professionals, often holding advanced [[master's degrees]], teachers drew a salary of just 66$ a week - in 2005 dollars, the equivalent of $21000 a year.

The UFT was created on [[March 16]], [[1960]], and grew rapidly. On [[November 7th]] [[1960]], the union organized a major [[Strike action|strike]]. The strike largely failed in its main objectives but obtained some concessions, as well as bringing much popular attention to the union. After much further negotiation, the UFT was chosen as the [[collective bargaining]] organization for all City teachers in December [[1961]].

From [[1964]] onwards, the president of the UFT was [[Albert Shanker]], a controversial but successful organizer. He was UFT head until [[1974]], when he became president of the larger [[American Federation of Teachers|AFT]].

In [[1968]], in the context of nationwide unrest over race and discrimination, several [[Jewish]] teachers were fired in the largely [[African-American]] neighborhood of Ocean Hill-Brownsville. Claiming  discrimination and a violation of [[due process]], teachers citywide struck. 

The [[1970s]] were a time of fiscal crisis for New York City. In [[1975]], some 14,000 teachers were laid off and class size soared. Another strike addressed some of these complaints and gave long-serving teachers longevity benefits.

== Current Issues ==
The current president of the UFT is [[Randi Weingarten]]. She has clashed repeatedly with the [[List of mayors of New York City|mayors]] of the city; in particular with former mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] and current mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]]. The latter has controversially made student promotion to [[third grade|third]], [[sixth grade|sixth]] and [[eighth grade]] contingent upon performance on [[standardized test]]s; the UFT opposes these plans.
