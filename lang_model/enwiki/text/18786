'''Richard John Charles Tomlinson''' (born 13 January 1963) is a New Zealand-born British former [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6) officer. His career is notable because he believed he had been subject to [[unfair dismissal]] from MI6 in 1995, and attempted to take his former employer to a [[employment tribunal|tribunal]]. MI6 refused, arguing that to do so would breach state security, although Tomlinson disputed this reasoning.

In 1997, Tomlinson was imprisoned under the [[Official Secrets Act 1989]] after he gave a synopsis of a proposed book detailing his career with MI6 to an Australian publisher. He served six months of a twelve-month sentence before being given [[parole]], whereupon he left the country. The book, named ''The Big Breach,'' was published in Moscow in 2001 (and later in Edinburgh), and was subsequently serialised by ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. The book detailed various aspects of MI6 operations, alleging that it employed a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] in the German [[Bundesbank]] and that it had a "[[license to kill (concept)|licence to kill]]", the latter later confirmed by the [[Richard Dearlove|head of MI6]] at a [[Diana inquest|public hearing]].<ref>{{cite news|last=English|first=Rebecca|title=Ex-MI6 chief admits agents do have a licence to kill but denies executing Diana|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-516712/Ex-MI6-chief-admits-agents-licence-kill-denies-executing-Diana.html|accessdate=18 February 2013|newspaper=The Daily Mail|date=21 February 2008}}</ref>

Tomlinson then attempted to aid [[Mohamed al-Fayed]] in his privately funded investigation into the death of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] and al-Fayed's son [[Dodi al-Fayed|Dodi]]. Tomlinson claimed that MI6 had considered assassinating [[Slobodan Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]], the president of Serbia, by staging a car crash using a powerful [[strobe light]] to blind the driver. He suggested that Diana and Dodi may have been killed by MI6 in the same way, although that claim was dismissed at their inquest in 2007. MI6 admitted that plans of that nature had been drafted regarding a different Eastern European official, but that the proposal had been swiftly rejected by management.

In 2009, MI6 agreed to allow Tomlinson to return to Britain, unfreeze royalties from his book and drop the threat of charges. MI6 also apologised for his mistreatment.<ref name=autogenerated7>The Sunday Times (London)  31 May 2009  Edition 1  MI6 woos home renegade ex-spy, p7</ref> Since 2000, staff at MI6 have been allowed employment tribunals, and have been able to unionise since 2008.<ref name = sis>[https://www.sis.gov.uk/about-us/legislation-and-accountability/investigatory-powers-tribunal.html Investigatory Powers Tribunal <U+2013> SIS (MI6)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name =dm>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2038970/MI6-stealth-subs-cost-fortune.html MI6 stealth subs cost us all a fortune | Mail Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Early life==
Richard John Charles Tomlinson was born in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], New Zealand, and raised in the nearby town of [[Ngaruawahia]].<ref name="Smith2007">{{cite book|author=Smith, Simon R.|title=Diana: The Lying Game|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FecXjaCRdckC&pg=PA73|accessdate=1 December 2012|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-4276-1734-7|page=73}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated13 /> Born to parents David and Jean, he was the middle child in a family of three brothers.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> His father came from a [[Lancashire]] farming family and he worked for the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (New Zealand)|Ministry of Agriculture]], and had met Jean whilst studying agriculture at [[Newcastle University]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Tomlinson, Richard, ''The Big Breach: From Top Secret to Maximum Security.''

His fellow student, historian [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]], remembers Tomlinson as "a bright and charming undergraduate, popular with the boys for his drinking and sporting prowess, and with the girls for his dark good looks."<ref>{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Andrew|title=The man with the golden tongue|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/4259011/The-man-with-the-golden-tongue.html|accessdate=22 October 2012|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 January 2001}}</ref></blockquote> His friends included [[Gideon Rachman]], who wrote him a reference after his tutor refused to do so.<ref>{{cite news

He graduated from the University of Cambridge's Gonville and Caius college with a starred First Class honours [[academic degree|degree]] in [[aeronautical engineering]] in 1984, and was approached by MI6 shortly afterwards, whose offer he turned down.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Following his graduation he took examinations to join the [[Royal Navy]] as a [[Fleet Air Arm]] Officer, but he failed the medical examination due to childhood [[asthma]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Instead he applied for and was awarded a [[Kennedy Scholarship]], which allowed him to study [[technology policy]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] with full funding during 1986-7.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Following this, he was awarded a prize from the [[Rotary Foundation]], allowing him to study in the country of his choice for a year. Consequently, he enrolled in a [[political science]] course at the [[University of Buenos Aires]], where he became a fluent Spanish speaker.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> He continued to pursue his aeronautical interests and qualified as a [[Military glider|glider]] pilot with the [[Argentine Air Force|Fuerza A<U+00E9>rea Argentina]]. From 1988-9 Tomlinson worked in [[Mayfair]], London, for management consultancy company [[Booz Allen Hamilton]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />

==Military and MI6 service==
[[File:MI6 Vauxhall Cross.jpg|thumbnail|right|MI6 headquarters at [[Vauxhall Cross]], London]]
Finding his desk job unsatisfying, Tomlinson joined the Territorial Army in September 1989, and after passing [[selection]], served as a reservist with the [[Special Air Service|SAS]] in the [[Artists Rifles]], and then [[23 SAS]], qualifying as a military [[parachutist]] and [[radio operator]]. He represented Britain in the 1990 [[Camel Trophy]], competing in [[Siberia]], and crossed the [[Sahara desert]] solo on a motorcycle.<ref name="Camel Trophy History">[http://www.cameltrophy.co.uk/history/1990.htm Camel Trophy Owners Club - Camel Trophy 1990 - Siberia USSR<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He enjoyed the experience, and subsequently applied to join MI6, and officially joined the Service on 23 September 1991.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web|title=CPS|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/press_releases/119_07/}}</ref> He completed his training with MI6 and claims he was the best recruit on his course, being awarded the rarely given "Box 1" attribute by his instructing officers including [[Nicholas Langman]].

Tomlinson worked in the "SOV/OPS" department, operating during the ending phases of the [[Cold War]] against the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=autogenerated17>{{cite news|title=Spying scandal spreads|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/09/99/britain_betrayed/452453.stm|accessdate=5 December 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=20 December 1999}}</ref> He was posted to a diplomatic role in Moscow, and was one of the agents responsible for the retrieval of the valuable [[Mitrokhin Archive]] in 1992.<ref name=autogenerated17 /> From March 1992 until September 1993 he worked in the Eastern European Controllerate.<ref name=autogenerated16>{{cite news|last=Iashmar|first=Paul|title=Seven of Richard Tomlinson's Big Claims|url=http://www.questia.com/read/1P2-5132280/seven-of-richard-tomlinson-s-big-claims|accessdate=22 February 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=23 January 2001}}</ref> Whilst working there, it was discovered that the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] had been receiving donations from Serbian supporters.<ref name=autogenerated16 /> In November 1993 he joined the [[Balkans]] Controllerate, and was posted to [[Sarajevo]] for six months as the MI6 representative in Bosnia during the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.<ref name=autogenerated13 /> There he was a "targeting officer", with a mission to identify potential informants and gather intelligence.<ref name=autogenerated16 /> A soldier who escorted Tomlinson to Bosnia described him as a "liability", a "sulk" and "totally unprofessional", although Tomlinson has disputed this.<ref>{{cite news|last=Langton|first=David|title=MI6 rebel claims 'Austin Powers' smear campaign|accessdate=22 October 2012|newspaper=Sunday Times|date=11 June 2006}}</ref>

From 1994 to 1995 Tomlinson worked in the operational [[counter-proliferation]] department.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tomlinson|first=Richard|title=Who was that at the shredder?|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2004/feb/09/iraq.iraq1|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=9 February 2004}}</ref> His first posting in this capacity was to work as an undercover agent against Iran, where he succeeded in penetrating the [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran|Iranian Intelligence Service]].<ref name=autogenerated15>{{cite news|last=Barnett|first=Antony|title=British agents helped Iran to make killer gas|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/jun/13/iran|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=The Observer|date=13 June 1999}}</ref> He posed as a British businessman, and infiltrated a network of arms dealers that included [[Nahum Manbar]].<ref name=autogenerated15 /> The British government supplied the Iranians with materials for [[chemical weapons]] in order to gain intelligence on Iran's military programme.<ref name=autogenerated15 /> Tomlinson's description of his Iranian activities are generally considered to be true, due to his personal involvement and knowledge of details that only an insider would know.<ref name=autogenerated15 />

However, MI6 obtained a [[public-interest immunity]] certificate from the [[Foreign Secretary]], [[Malcolm Rifkind]]. Having no further legal recourse to appeal against his dismissal, Tomlinson left the United Kingdom, and pursued his arguments against MI6 by publishing articles in the international press protesting his treatment, whilst working on a book detailing his career in the Service.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

In 1998, the Parliamentary [[Intelligence and Security Committee]] recommended that MI6 should be subject to UK employment law.<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100416132449/http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm45/4532/4532-02.htm#gen6 [ARCHIVED CONTENT&#93; Intelligence and Security Committee - Annual Report 1998-99<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Since 2000, employees of MI6 have had the same employment rights as other British citizens, including written contracts and access to employment tribunals. However, MI6 refused to allow these procedures to be applied retroactively to Tomlinson's case. MI6 have not succeeded in obtaining another PII certificate since the Tomlinson case.

Tomlinson returned to Britain, and in October 1997 was arrested and accused of breaking the [[Official Secrets Act 1989]], after delivering a seven-page synopsis of ''The Big Breach'' to the Australian office of [[Transworld (company)|Transworld]], a British publisher.<ref name=autogenerated12>{{cite news|last=Mueller|first=Andrew|title=The Spy Who Was Left out in the Cold|url=http://www.questia.com/read/1P2-2043565/the-spy-who-was-left-out-in-the-cold-since-being|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=Independent on Sunday|date=3 September 2006}}</ref> On 18 December 1997 he was sentenced to 12 months in prison after pleading guilty.<ref name=autogenerated4 />

In August 1998, after serving six months in prison and four months on probation, Tomlinson left the UK to live in exile.<ref name=autogenerated12 /> He set about completing ''The Big Breach'', which was published in 2001 in Russia.<ref name=autogenerated12 /> The book alleged that MI6 had infiltrated the German Bundesbank with a mole, and that the Service had a special means of writing in [[invisible ink]]. Other revelations were already public knowledge, such as that MI6 recruits are trained at [[Fort Monckton]], and that agents in the field often use the [[Pseudonym|alias]] of journalist.<ref name=autogenerated14>{{cite news|title=Breach birth|url=http://www.economist.com/node/486835?story_id=E1_QRGRPV|accessdate=18 February 2013|newspaper=The Economist|date=25 January 2001}}</ref>

After the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] ruled in his favour, the book was made available in the UK.<ref name=autogenerated12 /> However following the publication, the British Government obtained a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] [[Court order|order]] to confiscate all proceeds from the book, on the grounds that the government owned the copyright to anything written by Tomlinson.<ref name=autogenerated12 /> In September 2008, MI6 ended all legal objection to the publication of ''The Big Breach'', released the proceeds from the publication to Tomlinson, and admitted that the organisation's previous legal actions against him were disproportionate. However, it still refused to reinstate him or compensate him for the loss of his career and pension. Since 2009, Tomlinson can now travel freely to the UK.<ref name="The Sunday Times">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6395748.ece 'MI6 tempts rebel ex-spy back home'], The Sunday Times, 31 May 2009 {{subscription required}}</ref>

===Reception===
''[[The Economist]]'' criticised the "mess" that MI6 had made in failing to handle the Tomlinson case properly: "Recruiting Mr Tomlinson looks like a bad mistake, and his sacking seems to have been clumsily handled."<ref name=autogenerated14 /> The newspaper's reviewer complained: "there is little useful information in this breathless, whingeing and ill-written volume that a diligent reader of books about spying would not know already."<ref name=autogenerated14 />

Jimmy Burns, reviewing the book for the ''[[Financial Times]]'', speculated that it was plausible that "MI6's senior management realised they had made a terrible mistake in recruiting someone who thought that espionage was just one big adventure."<ref name=autogenerated6>Financial Times (London,England)  March 31, 2001 Saturday  London Edition 1  BOOKS: The spy who talked too much: The renegade MI6 agent is an unconvincing advocate of free speech, argues Jimmy Burns   BYLINE: By JIMMY BURNS   SECTION: BOOKS ; Pg. 4</ref> He concluded, however, that the book "left me with the feeling that the spooks in Whitehall could have avoided a great deal of adverse publicity by agreeing to Tomlinson's original proposal: an employment tribunal held in camera."<ref name=autogenerated6 />

Former [[President of South Africa]] [[Nelson Mandela]] reacted angrily to Tomlinson's accusation in the book that he had a long-standing relationship with MI6, describing it as a "disgraceful fabrication".<ref>{{cite news|title=Mandela rages at Tomlinson's claim of MI6 link|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/jan/27/nelsonmandela|accessdate=3 December 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 January 2001}}</ref> Tomlinson removed the references to Mandela in the British edition of the book, conceding that Mandela was probably unaware that the officials with whom he spoke were affiliated with MI6.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brit ex-spy to cut Mandela out of MI6 book|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/world/brit-ex-spy-to-cut-mandela-out-of-mi6-book-1.59984#.USFxQKXvjK0|accessdate=17 February 2013|newspaper=IOL News|date=1 February 2001}}</ref>

===List of MI6 agents===
In May 1999, a list of 116 alleged MI6 agents was sent to the [[LaRouche movement]]'s publication ''[[Executive Intelligence Review]]'',<ref name="BBC1605">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/345068.stm "UK: Al-Fayed denies leaking MI6 names"], BBC News, 16 May 1999</ref> a weekly magazine which published it online.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nuttall|first=Chris|title=Net will be death of MI6 - Tomlinson|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/347912.stm|accessdate=5 December 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=19 May 1999}}</ref> Its names included [[Andrew Fulton (Party chairman)|Andrew Fulton]], who had recently retired, as well as [[David Spedding]] and [[Richard Dearlove]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Alan|title=Former spy in line for top Scottish Tory job|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/1578128/Former-spy-in-line-for-top-Scottish-Tory-job.html|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=9 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Evans|first=Michael|title=MI6 fails to save spies from the Net|newspaper=The Times|date=15 May 1999}}</ref> MI6 biographer [[Stephen Dorril]] explained that most of the names were "light-cover" sources who worked out of embassies or missions posing as diplomats.<ref name="Dowdney">{{cite news|last=Dowdney|first=Mark|title=WE GET NET SPIES LIST|newspaper=Daily Mirror|date=14 May 1999}}</ref> Dorril argued, "it is well known that rival intelligence networks know who these people are and accept them."<ref name="Dowdney"/> MI6 claimed that Tomlinson had originated the list, which was something he had previously threatened to do, although he denied responsibility for it, and MI6 were unable to substantiate their accusation.<ref name=autogenerated8>{{cite news|title=I fear for my life, says renegade MI6 spy|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/1999/may/16/freespeech.internet1|accessdate=4 December 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 May 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Barnett|first=Antony|title=British agents helped Iran to make killer gas|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/jun/13/iran|accessdate=23 March 2013|newspaper=The Observer|date=13 June 1999}}</ref>

Tomlinson wrote, "If MI6 had set out to produce a list that caused me the maximum incrimination, but caused them the minimum damage, they could not have done a better job."<ref>[http://www.oocities.org/mi6_underground/recommendedreading.txt The Big Breach]</ref> He also said, "It mystifies me why MI6 gave the list credibility.

===Diana, Princess of Wales===
During 2008, Tomlinson was a witness for the inquest into the deaths of the Princess of Wales and [[Dodi al Fayed]].<ref name=autogenerated10>{{cite news|title=MI6 'Diana-style' plot dismissed|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7243053.stm|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=13 February 2008}}</ref> He had suggested that MI6 was monitoring Diana before her death and that her driver on the night she died, [[Henri Paul]], may have been an MI6 informant, and that her death resembled plans he saw during 1992 for the assassination of Yugoslav President [[Slobodan Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]], using a bright light to cause a traffic accident.<ref name=autogenerated10 />

At the [[Diana inquest|Coroner's Inquest into the death of the Princess]], on 13 February 2008, speaking by video-link from France, Tomlinson conceded that, after the interval of 16 or 17 years, he "could not remember specifically" whether the document he had seen during 1992 had in fact proposed the use of a strobe light to cause a traffic accident as a means of assassinating Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>, although use of lights for this purpose had been covered in his MI6 training.<ref name=autogenerated10 /> On being told that no MI6 file on Henri Paul had been found, Tomlinson said that it "would be absurd after 17 years to say I can positively disagree with it, but...
