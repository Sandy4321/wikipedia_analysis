The '''1964 [[Victorian Football Association]] season''' was the 83rd season of the top division of the [[Australian rules football]] competition, and the fourth season of its second division. The Division 1 premiership was won by the [[Port Melbourne Football Club]], after it defeated [[Williamstown Football Club|Williamstown]] in the Grand Final on 26 September by 36 points; it was Port Melbourne's 8th VFA premiership. The Division 2 premiership was won by [[Geelong West Football Club|Geelong West]], in only its second season in the VFA.

==Association Membership==
Less than a month before the 1964 season, the defending Division 1 premier club, [[Moorabbin Football Club|Moorabbin]], was suspended from the Association, in the aftermath of the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]]'s [[St Kilda Football Club]] announcing its intention to move its playing and administrative base to [[Moorabbin Oval]] from 1965.

===Background===
In the early 1960s, many Victorian Football League clubs were dissatisfied with their home grounds. In some cases, such as {{AFL Haw}} at [[Glenferrie Oval]], the grounds were small and the surroundings prohibited expansion. In other cases, such as {{AFL Fit}} at [[Brunswick Street Oval]], the local [[Victorian Premier Cricket|district cricket]] club, rather than the football club, had the controlling occupancy of the ground, leaving the football clubs with unsatisfactory lease arrangements and little control over how the ground was managed. Some Association grounds offered attractive solutions to the League clubs' problems: the grounds were often newer and larger than the older League grounds, they were not controlled by a strong traditional cricket club, and had the added benefit of being located in rapidly growing outer suburbs whence a League club could attract new fans.

At the same time, many local councils in the outer suburbs harboured ambitions of bringing League football to their districts, seeing great opportunity and great prestige in it. Councils, particularly those which oversaw a large population and managed a good quality ground, such as [[City of Moorabbin|Moorabbin]] and [[City of Coburg|Coburg]], had been actively seeking to be represented in the League for several years.

These combined driving forces had led to much discussion about League grounds leading up to 1964. Over the previous few years, two League clubs had made formal attempts to move to Association grounds: {{AFL Stk}}, to [[Brighton Football Club|Brighton]]'s then-home ground at [[Elsternwick Park]] in 1959;<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|date=4 April 1959|page=54|author=Jack Dunn|title=St Kilda to seek new home ground|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC}}</ref> and {{AFL Fit}} to the [[Preston City Oval|Preston football ground]] starting in 1962<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=40|author=|date=20 March 1962|title=Grounds row widens}}</ref> <U+2013> and there were several other rumours, most notably that {{AFL Ric}} was interested in moving to Oakleigh.

===Accusations against Preston and Moorabbin in October 1963===
The first grounds-related controversy of the off-season occurred in October 1963, when the [[Moorabbin Football Club|Moorabbin]] and [[Northern Blues|Preston]] Football Clubs <U+2013> defending Division 1 and Division 2 premiers respectively <U+2013> were both accused of having attempted to amalgamate with League teams, or having otherwise facilitated attempts by those League teams to move into their grounds. Both clubs were forced to face the Association executive committee to outline the roles, if any, that they had played in the negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=23|author=Graeme Kelly|date=10 October 1963|title=Clubs called before VFA}}</ref>

;Preston
Preston faced the Association on 15 October, over ongoing speculation of dealings with the [[Fitzroy Football Club]] since its first attempt to [[1962 VFA season#Threat to Preston|move to Preston in 1962]]. The Association decided that Fitzroy had been negotiating only with the [[City of Preston|Preston Council]], that the Preston Football Club had been involved only in the discussions that it could not avoid under the circumstances, and that the club was remaining loyal to the Association and had not sought amalgamation. No further action was taken against the club.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=24|author=|date=16 October 1963|title=Moorabbin to face V.F.A.}}</ref>

;Moorabbin
Moorabbin faced the Association on 29 October. Moorabbin was accused of having proposed to amalgamate with {{AFL Ric}} during the previous season (but been turned down), and having also engaged in discussions with Fitzroy over the potential for a move or amalgamation.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=62|author=Scot Palmer|date=10 October 1963|title=Top VFA clubs in trouble}}</ref> The executive found that Moorabbin had been acting against the interests of the Association, and it recommended that the club be expelled.<ref name="progressive">{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=60|author=Jack Dunn|date=30 October 1963|title=Club's threat to VFA}}</ref>

On 1 November, Moorabbin's fate was discussed at a Board of Management meeting. Moorabbin president Mr Don Bricker commented that "all that is wrong with Moorabbin is that it is too progressive for the VFA";<ref name="progressive" /> but he also stated in the club's defence that the [[City of Moorabbin|Moorabbin Council]] was the main driving force behind the push to get a League club to [[Moorabbin Oval]], and that it was in his club's best interests to support the council and pursue amalgamation with a League club, rather than oppose the council and find itself homeless and forced to disband if and when a League club moved in. The motion to expel the club required a two-thirds majority to pass, and was defeated by a single vote, with the final count 27<U+2013>15 in favour of expulsion.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=52|author=|date=2 November 1963|title=Moorabbin stays in}}</ref>

As such, preparations were made for the 1964 season including both Preston and Moorabbin in the fixture.

===St Kilda's move to Moorabbin Oval===
On 24 March 1964, the [[St Kilda Football Club]] announced that it would move its playing and administrative base to Moorabbin Oval, starting from the 1965 season.<ref name="sun25mar">{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=52|author=Jack Dunn|date=25 March 1964|title=Saints will move to Moorabbin in '65}}</ref> Under the agreement that was formally signed in July, St Kilda would lease the ground for 75 years, and would serve as ground manager;<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=49|author=Rex Pullen|date=4 July 1964|title=Saints to sign on Monday}}</ref> the Moorabbin Council would invest <U+00A3>100,000 to bring the ground to VFL standards and expand its capacity to 50,000, and St Kilda would pay annual rent of <U+00A3>5,000, invest <U+00A3>120,000 in establishing a [[liquor licence|licensed]] [[social club]], invest <U+00A3>375,000 over the first 45 years of the lease for ground improvements, and would sublet the ground to and prepare wickets for the [[Victorian Sub-District Cricket Association|sub-district]] Moorabbin Cricket Club during summer.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=56|author=Rex Pullen|date=5 August 1964|title=Saints given 75-yr. lease}}</ref> St Kilda's move was mostly motivated by the desire to be ground manager:<ref name="age25mar" /> its existing home, the [[St Kilda Cricket Ground]], was a very good quality venue with no specific failings to motivate the club to move (the ''[[The Sun News-Pictorial]]'' described it as the fourth-best football/cricket oval in the country, behind only the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] and [[Adelaide Oval]])<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=54|author=Jack Dunn|date=25 June 1964|title=New white elephant}}</ref>, but the [[St Kilda Cricket Club]] was ground manager and therefore controlled how the ground was operated and developed. Other benefits St Kilda derived from its move were that it could operate and profit from its own social club at the new venue, it was charged lower rent than the <U+00A3>8,000 per year it had paid at St Kilda, it escaped an arrangement under which cricket club members could purchase football club memberships for only one third of the regular price, and it allowed the club to appeal to new fans in the fast-growing Moorabbin area; the club had initially announced that it would change its name to the St Kilda<U+2013>Moorabbin Football Club after the move,<ref name="sun25mar" /> but these plans were abandoned two weeks later.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=44|author=|date=10 April 1964|title=Saints won't lose name}}</ref> The announcement came as a complete surprise to the football public, as there had been no rumours that the club was interested in leaving the St Kilda Cricket Ground since its attempt to move to Elsternwick Park in 1959.<ref name="sun25mar" />

The announcement came after two months of secret negotiations between St Kilda and the Moorabbin Council; and according to Bricker, the Moorabbin Football Club knew nothing of the negotiations until being informed in a meeting with both parties on 24 March, just hours before the move was first publicly announced.<ref name="age25mar">{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=25|author=Ron Carter|date=25 March 1964|title=St. Kilda moving to Moorabbin next year}}</ref> The loss of its ground would certainly have resulted in the club's expulsion from the Association, so the Moorabbin Council committed to providing a replacement Association-standard venue in the district if the football club wished it to do so.<ref name="sun25mar" /> The football club held an extraordinary meeting on 25 March, and at that meeting determined that its official position was to support the council in its efforts to attract League football to the district, and to seek to amalgamate with the St Kilda Football Club.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=40|author=Barrie Bretland|date=26 March 1964|title=Locals favour merger}}</ref>

At its next meeting on 3 April, the Association Board of Management again discussed expelling Moorabbin for "an act prejudicial to the V.F.A. in supporting League football".<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=20|author=Peter Stone|date=4 April 1964|title=V.F.A. suspends Moorabbin for season}}</ref> This time, the motion to expel succeeded in getting the two-thirds majority it required, passing by 30<U+2013>12; the six clubs to oppose the motion were [[Northcote Football Club|Northcote]], Moorabbin itself, and fellow south-eastern clubs [[Sandringham Football Club|Sandringham]], [[Brighton Football Club|Brighton]]-[[Caulfield Football Club|Caulfield]], [[Mordialloc Football Club|Mordialloc]] and [[Dandenong Football Club|Dandenong]]. The club was suspended from the Association indefinitely, but with its position to be reviewed at the end of the season. Moorabbin's position in Division 1 was filled at less than three weeks' notice by the 1963 Division 2 runners-up, [[Waverley Football Club|Waverley]], and the size of Division 2 was reduced to eight teams.

Moorabbin turned down offers to join the Federal League and the South-Eastern Suburban League at short notice for 1964, because playing in a league not affiliated with the [[Australian National Football Council]] would have precluded any chance of re-admission to the Association in 1965.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=22|author=Graeme Kelly|date=6 April 1964|title=Moorabbin has no right of appeal}}</ref> With no other options available at such short notice, Moorabbin sat out of football in 1964. All of its players received clearances to any club of their choosing, under the condition that they return to Moorabbin if and when it returned to the Association.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=48|author=|date=7 April 1964|title=Moorabbin decides}}</ref> The vast majority of its players went to the other south-eastern clubs which voted against its expulsion; Brighton-Caulfield was a particular beneficiary, and the twelve key senior players it recruited from Moorabbin lifted the struggling club, which had won eight wooden spoons in the previous twelve years, into the finals for the first time since 1950.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=59|author=Scot Palmer|date=8 April 1964|title=Moorabbin windfall to 'wooden-spooner'}}</ref><ref name="D2review" />

As the season progressed, the club had to deal with <U+00A3>1500 of debts it had accrued as pre-season expenses, but without any steady income from takings, and the motivation of Moorabbin's committee to seek re-admission to the Association waned.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=55|author=Scot Palmer|date=2 May 1964|title=This flag can't fly}}</ref> With no home games at which to carry out the tradition, the club's 1963 premiership flag was unfurled at a social event at Moorabbin Oval on the evening of 4 July;<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=46|author=Scot Palmer|date=12 June 1964|title=Big night for Moorabbin}}</ref> this was the club's VFA [[swan song]], as two nights later the committee voted 19<U+2013>2 to abandon attempts to seek readmission in 1965. It began investigating a return to the Federal League,<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=43|author=|date=7 July 1964|title=They'll leave the VFA}}</ref> and ultimately disbanded.

==Division 1==
The Division 1 home-and-home season was played over 18 rounds; the top four then contested the finals under the [[McIntyre System#Page-McIntyre system|Page-McIntyre system]].
