'''Pintupi''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|p|<U+026A>|n|(t)|<U+0259>|<U+02CC>|p|i}} or {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|p|<U+026A>|n|(t)|<U+0259>|<U+02CC>|b|i}})<ref>{{OED|Pintupi}}</ref> is an [[Indigenous Australian languages|indigenous Australian language]]. It is one of the [[Wati languages]] of the large [[Pama<U+2013>Nyungan languages|Pama<U+2013>Nyungan family]]. It is one of the varieties of the [[Western Desert Language]] (WDL).

[[Pintupi]] is the name commonly used to refer to a variety of the [[Western Desert Language]] spoken by [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] people whose traditional lands are in the area between [[Lake MacDonald]] and [[Lake Mackay]], stretching from [[Mount Liebig]] in the Northern Territory to [[Jupiter Well]] (west of [[Pollock Hills]]) in Western Australia. These people moved (or were forced to move) into the indigenous communities of [[Papunya, Northern Territory|Papunya]] and [[Haasts Bluff, Northern Territory|Haasts Bluff]] in the west of the [[Northern Territory]] in the 1940s-1980s. The last Pintupi people to leave their traditional lifestyle in the desert came into [[Kiwirrkurra|Kiwirrkura]] in 1984.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1525/ae.1988.15.4.02a00010|year=1988 |journal=American Ethnologist |volume=15|issue=4 |pages=609<U+2013>624 |first=Fred |last=Myers |title=Locating Ethnographic Practice: Romance, Reality and Politics in the Outback}}</ref> Over recent decades they have moved back into their traditional country, setting up the communities of [[Kintore, Northern Territory|Kintore]] (in Pintupi known as ''Wa<u>l</u>ungurru'') in the Northern Territory, [[Kiwirrkurra|Kiwirrkura]] and [[Jupiter Well]] (in Pintupi ''Puntutjarrpa'') in Western Australia.

Children who were born in Papunya and Haasts Bluff grew up speaking a new variety of Pintupi, now known as '''Pintupi-Luritja''', due to their close contact with speakers of [[Arrernte language|Arrernte]], [[Warlpiri]] and other varieties of the WDL. This has continued through the moves west so that most Pintupi people today speak Pintupi-Luritja, although there remains a clear distinction between the more western and eastern varieties.

== Phonology ==
The phonology of Pintupi has been described by K.&nbsp;C. and L.&nbsp;E. Hansen based on fieldwork conducted in [[Papunya, Northern Territory]] in 1967<U+2013>68.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3622818|year=1969 |journal=Oceanic Linguistics |volume=8|issue=2 |pages=153<U+2013>70 |first=K.&nbsp;C. |last=Hansen |coauthors=L.&nbsp;E. Hansen |title=Pintupi phonology|jstor=3622818}}</ref>

===Consonants===
Pintupi has 17 [[consonant]] phonemes. The symbols used in the practical orthography are shown in brackets where they differ from the IPA symbols.

|}

The lamino-alveolars are frequently [[palatalized]], and {{IPA|/t<U+033B>/}} often has an [[affricated]] [[allophone]] {{IPA|[t<U+02E2>]}}.

The trill {{IPA|/r/}} usually has a single contact (i.e. a [[flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|[<U+027E>]}}) in ordinary speech, but multiple contacts (a true trill) in slow, emphatic, or angry speech. The retroflex approximant {{IPA|/<U+027B>/}} may also be realized as a flap {{IPA|[<U+027D>]}}.

Hansen and Hansen (1969) refer to the [[retroflex consonant]]s as "apico-domal".

=== Vowels ===
Pintupi has six vowel phonemes, three long and three short. All are [[monophthong]]al at the phonemic level. Again, the symbols used in the practical orthography are shown enclosed in brackets where they differ from the phonemic symbols.

|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| &nbsp; || {{IPA|a}} <U+2022> {{IPA|a<U+02D0>}} (aa) || &nbsp;
|}

The short vowel phonemes are [[voiceless|devoiced]] when word-final at the end of a clause, as in {{IPA|[<U+014B>urakutulpi<U+0325>]}} 'he finally (came) to camp', {{IPA|[kapilat<U+033B>u<U+027B><U+1E01>]}} 'we all (brought) water for him', and {{IPA|[jilari<U+014B>u<U+0325>]}} 'it was close'.

Short vowels are [[r-colored vowel|rhotacized]] before retroflex consonants, as in {{IPA|[wa<U+02DE><U+0288>a]}} 'tree (generic)', {{IPA|[ka<U+02DE><U+0273>a]}} 'spear (one type)', and {{IPA|[mu<U+02DE><U+026D>i]}} 'a shelter'.

The open vowel {{IPA|/a/}} is diphthongized to {{IPA|[a<U+2071>]}} and {{IPA|[a<U+1D58>]}} before {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} respectively, as in {{IPA|[wa<U+2071>junpuwa]}} 'pare (it)' and {{IPA|[ka<U+1D58>wu<U+02DE><U+0273>pa]}} 'cold ashes'.

===Orthography===

An orthography was developed by the Hansens and is used in their publications, which include a dictionary, a grammar sketch and bible portions. This orthography is also used in the bilingual school, and especially in the school's Literature Production Centre. The orthography is shown in the above tables of consonants and vowels.

=== Phonotactics ===
Pintupi has only two possible syllable types: CV (a consonant followed by a vowel) and CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant). In the middle of a word, {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/<U+014B>/}} may appear in the [[syllable coda]] only when followed by a [[homorganic]] plosive, as in {{IPA|/t<U+033B>ampu/}} 'left side' and {{IPA|/mi<U+014B>ki<U+027B>i/}} 'mouse'. Otherwise, only coronal sonorants may appear in the syllable coda. All consonants except the apico-alveolars and {{IPA|/l<U+033B>/}} may appear in word-initial position; only coronal sonorants (except {{IPA|/<U+027B>/}}) may appear in word-final position. However, at the end of a clause, the syllable {{IPA|/pa/}} is added to consonant-final words, so consonants may not appear in clause-final position.

Short vowels may appear anywhere in the word; long vowels may appear only in the first syllable (which is stressed), as in {{IPA|/<U+0273>i<U+02D0>rki/}} 'eagle' and {{IPA|/ma<U+02D0>ra/}} 'ignorant'.

=== Phonological processes ===
When a suffix-initial {{IPA|/t/}} follows a root-final consonant, the {{IPA|/t/}} [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilates]] in [[place of articulation]] to the preceding consonant, as in {{IPA|/ma<U+026D>an<U+033B> + tu/}} <U+2192> {{IPA|[ma<U+026D>an<U+033B>t<U+033B>u]}} 'younger sibling (transitive subject)', {{IPA|/pawu<U+026D> + ta/}} <U+2192> {{IPA|[pawu<U+026D><U+0288>a]}} 'at the spirit ground'. However, the sequence {{IPA|/r + t/}} undergoes [[coalescence (linguistics)|coalescence]] and surfaces as simple {{IPA|[<U+0288>]}}, as in {{IPA|/t<U+033B>intar + ta/}} <U+2192> {{IPA|[t<U+033B>inta<U+0288>a]}} 'at Tjintar'.

When two identical CV sequences meet at a word boundary, they undergo [[haplology]] and fuse into a single word in rapid speech, as in {{IPA|/mutikaji<U+014B>'''ka ka'''<U+026D>pakati<U+014B>u/}} <U+2192> {{IPA|[mutikaji<U+014B>'''ka'''<U+026D>pakati<U+014B>u]}} 'climbed into the car' and {{IPA|/parari'''<U+014B>u <U+014B>u'''<U+027B>urpa/}} <U+2192> {{IPA|[parari'''<U+014B>u'''<U+027B>urpa]}} 'went around the middle'. When a lamino-alveolar consonant or {{IPA|/j/}} is followed by {{IPA|/a/}} in the last syllable of a word, and the next word begins with {{IPA|/ja/}}, the word-initial {{IPA|/j/}} is deleted and the two adjacent {{IPA|/a/}}-sounds merge into a long {{IPA|/a<U+02D0>/}}, as in {{IPA|/<U+014B>a'''l<U+033B>a ja'''nuja/}} <U+2192> {{IPA|[<U+014B>a'''l<U+033B>a<U+02D0>'''nuja]}} 'they all came' and {{IPA|/wi'''ja ja'''pura/}} <U+2192> {{IPA|[wi'''ja<U+02D0>'''pura]}} 'not west'.

=== Prosody ===
Pintupi words are [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]ed on the first syllable. In careful speech, every second syllable after that (i.e. the third, fifth, seventh, etc.) may receive a secondary stress, but secondary stress never falls on the final syllable of the word, as in {{IPA|[<U+02C8>t<U+033B>aka<U+02CC>mara<U+02CC>ku<U+0273>a<U+027B>a]}} 'for the benefit of Tjakamara' and {{IPA|[<U+02C8>juma<U+02CC><U+027B>i<U+014B>ka<U+02CC>mara<U+02CC>t<U+033B>u<U+027B>aka]}} 'because of mother-in-law'. However, the particle {{IPA|/ka/}} (which indicates a change of subject) is not stressed when it is the first [[morpheme]] in a clause, as in {{IPA|/ka<U+02C8>janu/}} '(he) went'.
