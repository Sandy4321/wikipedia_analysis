'''Khan Noonien Singh''', commonly shortened to '''Khan''', is a [[villain]] in the fictional ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe. According to backstory given in the character's first appearance, the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' original series episode "[[Space Seed]]", Khan is a superhuman tyrant who once controlled more than a quarter of the Earth during the [[Eugenics Wars]] of the 1990s. After being revived in 2267 by the crew of the [[Starship Enterprise|''Enterprise'']], Khan attempts to capture the starship, but is thwarted by [[James T. Kirk]] and exiled to a harsh world to create a new civilization with his people. The character returns in the 1982 film ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', set fifteen years after "Space Seed", in which Khan escapes his imprisonment and sets out to seek revenge upon Kirk. The character was portrayed by [[Ricardo Montalb<U+00E1>n]] on both the television episode and in the movie.

Initially conceived as a brutal man of Nordic ancestry, Khan first appears as a Sikh who is both admired and opposed by the ''Enterprise'' crew. [[Harve Bennett]], executive producer for ''Star Trek II'', later chose Khan as the villain to appear in the sequel to ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. To reflect the time spent marooned on an inhospitable world, Khan was given a costume which looked as though it was scavenged from different items and showed off Montalb<U+00E1>n's physique. The character has been positively received by critics and fans; Khan was voted as one of the top ten greatest film villains of all time by the [[Online Film Critics Society]].

==Appearances==
==="Space Seed"===
Khan makes his introductory appearance in ''Star Trek''{{'}}s twenty-third episode, "[[Space Seed]]", first broadcast on February 16, 1967. According to the backstory revealed in the episode, Khan is one of a group of genetically engineered supermen, bred to be free of both mental and physical defects, who were thrown from power after the [[Eugenics Wars]] of the 1990s.<ref name=Adaptations>{{cite book|title=Adaptations: From Text to Screen, Screen to Text|author=Cartmell, Deborah; Whelehan, Imelda |pages=179|year=1999|publisher=Routledge Publishing|isbn=0-415-16738-8}}</ref>  Khan had been both the most successful conqueror and the most benign ruler of the group, ruling western Asia with a firm but peaceful hand until he was deposed.<ref name=Rand>{{cite book|title=The Age of Rand: Imagining an Objectivist Future World|author=Frederick Cookinham|chapter=Rules for Supermen|pages=154&ndash;155|year=2005|publisher=iUniverse|id=ISBN 0595351530}}</ref> While most of the supermen were killed or sentenced to death, Khan and 84 others escaped Earth via the [[sleeper ship]] [[SS Botany Bay|SS ''Botany Bay'']]. Cryogenically frozen in suspended animation, the crew of the ''Botany Bay'' are discovered by the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|''Enterprise'']] in 2267.

When Khan's sleep chamber malfunctions, he is transported to the ''Enterprise'', where he reawakens and learns he is in the 23rd century. Given spacious quarters while the ''Botany Bay'' is towed to a starbase, Khan fascinates and charms the ship's historian, [[Marla McGivers]] ([[Madlyn Rhue]]), while using his access to the ship's technical manuals to learn how to take over and operate the ''Enterprise''. McGivers agrees to help Khan revive the other supermen, allowing him to launch a coup. In order to coerce the ''Enterprise'' crew to cooperate with him, Khan places Captain [[James Kirk]] ([[William Shatner]]) in the ship's compression chamber and threatens to kill Kirk unless the crew submits. McGivers cannot stand by as her Captain dies and frees Kirk, who neutralizes Khan's men by using a 'neural gas.' Khan heads to engineering and sets the ship's engines to self-destruct, whereupon he is incapacitated by Kirk. Captain Kirk conducts a hearing, sentencing Khan and his followers to exile on an uncolonized world, Ceti Alpha V. Khan accepts Kirk's challenge, and McGivers joins Khan rather than face court-martial. [[Spock]] ([[Leonard Nimoy]]) wonders what the "seed" Kirk has planted will bear in a hundred years.

===''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan''===
Khan returns in the 1982 feature film ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', when [[USS Reliant|USS ''Reliant'']] officers [[Clark Terrell]] and [[Pavel Chekov]] ([[Paul Winfield]] and [[Walter Koenig]]) beam down to what they believe is Ceti Alpha VI, looking for an inhospitable world to test the Genesis device, a powerful [[terraforming]] tool. Khan's followers capture Terrell and Chekov, and Khan explains that the barren wasteland they now inhabit is in fact Ceti Alpha V. The sixth planet of the system exploded shortly after Khan and his followers were marooned, causing massive climate disturbances. The planet was turned into a desert, and many of the survivors (including McGivers, who had become Khan's wife) were killed by the only surviving species of animal, the [[Ceti eel]]. By the time the ''Reliant'' arrives at Ceti Alpha, only twenty of Khan's followers are alive. Swearing vengeance on Kirk, Khan takes control of Chekov and Terrell using ceti eels implanted in the officer's brains, rendering them vulnerable to suggestion. Khan then seizes control of the ''Reliant'', intent on capturing Project Genesis and attaining his revenge for exile.<ref name=Adaptations />

Lured by Khan to the planet Regula I, the ''Enterprise'' falls victim to Khan's surprise attack. Kirk, his ship disabled, tricks Khan by using a special code to remotely lower the ''Reliant''{{'}}s shields and inflict significant damage. Khan is forced to withdraw and make repairs. Using the mind-controlled Terrell and Chekov as spies, Khan captures the Genesis device and leaves Kirk marooned on Regula I. However, Khan is deceived by Spock into thinking that the ''Enterprise'' is crippled. Khan is surprised when Kirk and the ''Enterprise'' escape to the nearby Mutara nebula. Goaded into following Kirk, Khan pilots the ''Reliant'' into the nebula, where shields and visuals are inoperable. Due to Khan's inexperience with three-dimensional space combat, the ''Enterprise'' disables the ''Reliant'' and kills Khan's followers. Refusing to accept defeat, Khan activates the Genesis device, intent on killing his foe along with himself. Khan believes he has doomed his enemy before he dies, but the self-sacrifice of [[Spock]] allows the ''Enterprise'' to escape via the [[warp drive]].

===Novels===
Author [[Greg Cox]] penned three non-canonical ''Star Trek'' novels featuring Khan. In the two-volume ''[[The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh]]'', Khan and his followers are placed aboard the ''Botany Bay'' by [[Gary Seven]] as part of a deal to stop Khan's machinations on Earth. The 2006 follow-up, ''[[To Reign in Hell: The Exile of Khan Noonien Singh]]'', relates what happened to Khan and his fellow exiles between the events of "Space Seed" and ''The Wrath of Khan''.

==Design and analysis==
In "Space Seed" writer [[Carey Wilber]]'s original plot treatment, the character of Khan was a Nordic superman named Harold Erricsen. The first draft of the script introduced the character as John Ericssen, who is revealed to be a man involved in "the First World Tyranny" called Ragnar Thorwald. The character of Thorwald was more brutal than Khan in the final version, killing guards using a phaser.<ref name="freeman">{{cite journal|author=Freeman, John (editor)|year=2005|month=April/May|title=Flashback: 'Space Seed'|journal=[[Star Trek Magazine]]|publisher=Titan Magazines|volume=1|issue=120|pages=|}}</ref> By the final draft, Khan is of Indian ancestry.<ref>'''Marla McGivers''': From the northern India area, I'd guess.

He is gracious, smiling, fearless, and generous.  He is not threatened by the success of others, and encourages their self-esteem.  He is also ambitious, desiring a challenge commensurate with his abilities. This ambition, however, is not tempered by any consideration of the rights of others.<ref name=Rand /> Author Paul Cantor asserts that Khan is a mirror image of Kirk, sharing his aggressiveness, ambition, and even his womanizing tendencies, but possessing them in far greater degree.<ref name="cantor"/> During the episode, several of the characters express their admiration for the man, while opposing his plans and what he stands for at the same time.<ref name="cantor">{{cite book|author=Cantor, Paul A.|year=2001|title=Gilligan Unbound: Popular Culture in the Age of Globalization|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|ibsn=0-742-50779-3|pages=222&ndash;223}}</ref>

[[Image:Khan-and-company---star-tre.png|thumb|right|Khan and his followers in ''Star Trek II''. Note Khan's revealing costume and the garments worn by his crew.]]
After the disappointing response to the first ''Star Trek'' feature film, ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture|The Motion Picture]]'', Paramount executives appointed [[Harve Bennett]], a television producer who had never watched ''Star Trek'', to be executive producer for the sequel.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rioux, Terry Lee|year=2005|title=From Sawdust to Stardust: The Biography of DeForest Kelley|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-7434-5762-5|pages=240<U+2013>242}}</ref> Bennett watched all the original series episodes and chose Khan from "Space Seed" as a possible villain for the film.<ref name="robinson">{{cite journal|author=Robinson, Ben (editor)|year=2002|month=September|title=Special 'The Wrath of Khan' Issue|journal=[[Star Trek: The Magazine]]|publisher=Fabbri Publishing|volume=3|issue=5}}</ref> Early drafts of the script had Khan as a shadowy tyrant leading a planet in revolt; later drafts added the "Genesis device" which Khan would steal.<ref name="robinson"/>

Costume designer Robert Fletcher wanted to emphasize the effects of their harsh environment on Khan and his followers. "My intention with Khan was to express the fact that they had been marooned on that planet with no technical infrastructure, so they had to cannibalize from the spaceship whatever they used or wore. Therefore, I tried to make it look as if they had dressed themselves out of pieces of upholstery and electrical equipment that composed the ship," he said.<ref name="designing khan">{{cite video|people=''Star Trek'' cast and crew|date2=2002-08-06|title=Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, The Directors Edition: Special Features: Designing Khan|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|medium=DVD; Disc 2/2}}</ref> Director Nicholas Meyer told Montalb<U+00E1>n to keep Khan's right glove on at all times, in order to give viewers a puzzle they could form their own opinions about and add mystery to the character.<ref name="meyer-commentary">{{cite video|people=[[Nicholas Meyer|Meyer, Nicholas]]|date2=2002-08-06|title=Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, The Directors Edition: Audio commentary|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|medium=DVD; Disc 1/2}}</ref> Meyer has been repeatedly asked if Montalb<U+00E1>n wore a prosthetic chest for his scenes, as his uniform was purposefully designed with an open front.

At no point during ''The Wrath of Khan'' are Khan and Kirk face to face; they speak to each other only over communication links such as view screens. This was due in part to the fact that the set of the ''Reliant'' was a [[redress]] of the ''Enterprise'' bridge, and the two actors' scenes were filmed four months apart.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[William Shatner|Shatner, William]]|coauthors=Chris Kreski|year=1994|title=Star Trek Memories|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-0610-9235-5|pages=161}}</ref> Montalb<U+00E1>n recited his lines with a script girl instead of to [[William Shatner]].<ref name="torontosun-deep space"/>

Montalb<U+00E1>n said, in promotional interviews for the movie, he realized early on in his career that a good villain does not see himself as villainous.<ref name="torontosun-deep space">{{cite news|author=Spelling, Ian|date=1994-08-07|title=From deep space to heaven|work=[[The Toronto Sun]]|accessdate=2008-10-01}}</ref> The villain may do villainous things, but he feels that he is doing them for righteous reasons. Montalb<U+00E1>n further stated he always tried to find a flaw in the character because no one is completely good or completely evil; while Khan had a rather distorted view of reality and therefore performs acts of evil, he still feels that his vengeance is a noble cause because of the death of his wife.<ref name="torontosun-deep space"/> Khan quotes the character of [[Ahab]] from ''[[Moby Dick]]'' throughout the film, driving home his lust to make Kirk pay for the wrongs he has inflicted upon him.<ref name="meyer-commentary"/>
