'''''Mansfield Park''''' is a [[novel]] by [[Jane Austen]].  It was written between [[1812]] and [[1814]] at [[Chawton]] Cottage, and published in July 1814 by the Mr. Egerton who had given to the world its two predecessors. When the novel reached a second edition, its publication was taken over by John Murray, who was also responsible for bringing out its successor, ''[[Emma]]''. It is, perhaps, the most [[satire|satirical]] of Austen's works{{fact}}.

==Plot summary==
{{spoiler}}
The main [[fictional character |character]], Fanny Price, is sent at an early age from her poor family to live with her rich uncle and aunt, Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram, at Mansfield Park.  She grows up with her four cousins, Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia, but is always treated as inferior to them; only Edmund shows her real kindness.  Despite often being unhappy during her childhood, Fanny grows up with a strong sense of propriety and [[virtue]], and remains closely attached to her brother William (possibly based on Jane Austen's brother [[Francis Austen|Frank]]), who has begun a career in the [[Royal Navy]].  Over time, Fanny's gratitude for Edmund's kindness secretly grows into love.

Fanny's other aunt, Mrs. Norris, is a miserly busybody who spoils the Bertram children (especially Maria) while putting Fanny down and verbally battering her.  Sir Thomas tries to correct the influence of Mrs. Norris on his children, but only succeeds in setting himself up as a severe patriach from whom they become accustomed to conceal their true feelings and opinions.  Maria and Julia end up vain and convinced of their own worth simply by dint of being beautiful, accomplished women of consequence, whilst Tom is an irresponsible partygoer and gambler.  Only Edmund survives his upbringing with his sense of virtue unscathed.

The bulk of the action of the book takes place while Sir Thomas is away for two years in [[Antigua]], dealing with problems on his plantation there.  The romantic entanglements begin after the arrival of two siblings, Mr. and Miss Crawford, to visit their sister Mrs. Grant, who is the wife of the inhabitant of Mansfield Park parsonage.  Miss Crawford and Edmund begin to form an attachment, though Edmund often worries that she displays a lack of correct manners and worryingly irreverent opinions, particularly towards his chosen vocation of clergyman.  The growing affection between them grieves Fanny, who not only fears to lose him but feels that love is blinding Edmund to deep flaws in Miss Crawford's character.  Mr. Crawford meanwhile sports with the affections of both Bertram sisters, despite the fact that Maria is already engaged to the rather dull, but very rich, Mr. Rushworth.

On Sir Thomas's return, he finds the young people in the midst of a grand scheme to put on a play (considered a highly inappropriate activity for gently born women to participate in, and ultimately opposed only by Fanny).  His arrival causes the play to be aborted. Mr. Crawford leaves, and Maria is crushed.  Her marriage to Mr. Rushworth goes ahead, despite the jealousy that had been engendered in him by her behaviour with Mr. Crawford, and they leave on honeymoon, taking Julia with them.  In their absence, Fanny becomes of more consequence to the family and her uncle shows her much greater affection than previously.  When Mr. Crawford returns to Mansfield Park after an absence, she becomes the new target of his flirtations.  However, her genuine gentleness and kindness cause this plan to backfire, and he falls in love with her.  But when he proposes, her knowledge of his previous improper behaviour towards her cousins, as well as her existing attachment to Edmund, cause her to reject him.  Her family is dismayed at this; Sir Thomas rebukes her for insubordination and ingratitude.  But Fanny holds her ground, knowing that she has acted correctly (she cannot bring herself to implicate Maria by explaining her reasons).

Sir Thomas contrives a plan to send Fanny back to her family's shabby home for a few months, so that she might realise that a rich husband is a very useful thing to have.  Mr. Crawford comes to visit her to demonstrate that he has changed his ways and is now worthy of her affections (partly by helping to secure a promotion for Fanny's brother William), and this strategy begins to soften Fanny's attitude, though she is still far from accepting him.  However, shortly after he leaves for London, Fanny begins to hear rumours of a scandal involving him and Maria; it later emerges that on resuming their acquaintance in London, Crawford recommenced his flirtations, which ended up in an elopement.  Because of this, an illness suffered by Tom (in the aftermath of a drinking binge), and the elopement of Julia and Mr. Yates, the situation at Mansfield Park is dire, and Fanny is recalled to be of both use and comfort to her aunt and uncle.  In the aftermath of the scandal, Edmund breaks off relations with Miss Crawford, and eventually comes to return Fanny's affections, and they marry.

==Literary significance & criticism==
''Mansfield Park'' is the most controversial and perhaps the least popular of Austen's major novels.  Regency critics praised the novel's wholesome morality, but many modern readers find Fanny's timidity and disapproval of the theatricals difficult to sympathise with and reject the idea (made explicit in the final chapter) that she is a better person for the relative privations of her childhood. Jane Austen's own mother thought Fanny "insipid,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/opmansfp.html|title=Early opinions of Mansfield Park|accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> and many other readers have found her priggish and unlikeable<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/austen-l.html#X12|title=Controversy over Fanny Price, from the AUSTEN-L mailing list|accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref>. Other critics point out that she is a complex personality, perceptive yet given to wishful thinking, and that she shows courage and grows in self-esteem during the latter part of the story.  Austen biographer [[Claire Tomalin]], who is generally rather critical of Fanny, argues that "it is in rejecting obedience in favour of the higher dictate of remaining true to  her own conscience that Fanny rises to her moment of heroism."<ref>Claire Tomalin, ''Jane Austen: A Life'' (New York: Vintage, 1997), p. 230.</ref> But Tomalin reflects the ambivalence that many readers feel towards Fanny when she also writes: "More is made of Fanny Price's faith, which gives her the courage to resist what she thinks is wrong; it also makes her intolerant of sinners, whom she is ready to cast aside, just as Mr. Collins recommends that the Bennets should cast aside the sinful Lydia and Wickham."<ref>Tomalin, ''Jane Austen: A Life'' (New York: Vintage, 1997), p. 140.</ref>

The story contains much social satire, particularly at the expense of the two aunts. It is perhaps the most socially realistic Austen novel, with Fanny's family of origin, the Prices, coming from a much lower echelon of society than most Austen characters, and the novel's suggestion that the wealth of the Bertrams is derived from [[slavery]] in the [[West Indies]]. [[Edward Said]] implicated the novel in western culture's careless attitude towards slavery. Other critics, such as Gabrielle White, have argued against Said's condemnation of Jane Austen and western culture, maintaining that Austen and other writers, including [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[Edmund Burke]], opposed slavery and helped make its eventual abolition possible.  Claire Tomalin, following literary critic Brian Southam, points out that Fanny, usually so timid, questions her uncle vigorously about the slave trade and receives no answer, suggesting that her vision of the trade's immorality is clearer than his.<ref> Tomalin, ''Jane Austen: A Life,'' p.230.</ref>

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
''Mansfield Park'' has been the subject of two adaptations:

*[[1999]]:  ''[[Mansfield Park (1999 film)|Mansfield Park]]'', film directed by [[Patricia Rozema]], starring [[Frances O'Connor]] as Fanny Price and [[Jonny Lee Miller]] as Edmund Bertram (interestingly, he also featured in the 1983 version, playing one of Fanny's brothers). This film alters several major elements of the story and draws on the personal letters of Jane Austen as well as the novel.

*[[1983]]:  ''[[Mansfield Park (1983 series)|Mansfield Park]]'', BBC series directed by [[David Giles]], starring [[Sylvestra Le Touzel]] as Fanny Price, [[Nicholas Farrell]] as Edmund Bertram and [[Anna Massey]] as Mrs. Norris.

==Trivia==
In the [[Harry Potter]] series of novels, [[Argus Filch]] is the caretaker at Hogwarts School.  His cat (loathed by all the students) is named "Mrs Norris", for the character in ''Mansfield Park''.

The value of the novel as literature was a subject of contention between the two main characters in [[Whit Stillman]]'s film ''[[Metropolitan (film)|Metropolitan]]'', one of the characters being devoted to the work of [[Jane Austen]], the other having read only an essay critical of the book by [[Lionel Trilling]].
