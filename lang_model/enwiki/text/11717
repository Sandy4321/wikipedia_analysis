'''Mary Jane McLeod Bethune''' (July 10, 1875--May 18, 1955) was an American educator and civil rights leader best known for starting a school for black students in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] that eventually became [[Bethune-Cookman University]] and for being an adviser to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

Born in [[South Carolina]] to parents who had been slaves, she took an early interest in her own education. With the help of benefactors, Bethune attended college hoping to become a [[missionary]] in Africa. When that did not materialize, she started a school for black girls in Daytona Beach. From six students it grew and merged with an institute for black boys and eventually became the Bethune-Cookman School. Its quality far surpassed the standards of education for black students, and rivaled those of white schools. Bethune worked tirelessly to ensure funding for the school, and used it as a showcase for tourists and donors, to exhibit what educated black people could do. She was president of the college from 1923 to 1942 and 1946 to 1947, one of the few women in the world who served as a college president at that time. 

Bethune was also active in women's clubs, and her leadership in them allowed her to become nationally prominent. She worked for the election of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1932, and became a member of Roosevelt's [[Black Cabinet]], sharing the concerns of black people with the Roosevelt administration while spreading Roosevelt's message to blacks, who had been traditionally Republican voters. Upon her death, columnist [[Louis E. Martin]] said, "She gave out faith and hope as if they were pills and she some sort of doctor."<ref>Martin, Louis E.

==Early life== 

[[Image:Mary McLeod Bethune Cabin.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|The cabin in Mayesville, South Carolina where Mary McLeod was born.]]
Mary Jane McLeod was born on July 10, 1875 near Mayesville, South Carolina on a rice and [[cotton]] farm, living in a small log cabin, the fifteenth of seventeen children to Samuel and Patsy MacIntosh McLeod, both former slaves.<ref name="cookmanbio">{{cite web|url=http://www.cookman.edu/subpages/Founder_of_the_College.asp|title=Bethune Cookman College Founder's Biography}} Retrieved on January 11, 2008.</ref><ref name="leffall">Leffall, Dolores and Sims, J. (Summer, 1976). "Mary McLeod Bethune: The Educator; Also Including a Selected Annotated Bibliography." ''Journal of Negro Education''.

Retrieved on January 11, 2008.</ref> Most of her siblings were born into slavery. Her mother worked for her former owner, and her father farmed cotton near a large house they called "The Homestead."

After demonstrating a desire to read and write, McLeod attended Mayesville's one-room schoolhouse, Trinity Mission School that was run by the [[Presbyterian]] Board of Missions of [[Freedmen]]. Her teacher, [[Emma Jane Wilson]], became a significant [[mentor]] in her life.<ref name="thomas"/> Wilson had attended [[Barber-Scotia_College#Scotia_Seminary|Scotia Seminary]] (now [[Barber-Scotia College]]), so arranged for McLeod to attend the same school on a [[scholarship]], which she did from 1888-1894. She then attended Dwight Moody's Institute for Home and Foreign Missions in [[Chicago]] (now the [[Moody Bible Institute]]), hoping to become a [[missionary]] in Africa. However, she was told that she would not be able to go because black missionaries were not needed, so she instead planned to teach.<ref name="usca"/>

She married Albertus Bethune in 1898 and they subsequently lived in [[Savannah, Georgia]] for a year while she did some [[social work]]. She was persuaded by a visiting preacher named C.J. Uggins to relocate to [[Palatka, Florida]] to run a mission school.<ref>"Mary McLeod Bethune." ''Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic History''. Gale Group, 1999.</ref> She did so in 1899 and began an outreach to prisoners and ran the mission school. She supplemented her income by selling [[life insurance]].<ref name="usca"/> Albertus left the family in 1907 and did not seek a divorce, but relocated to South Carolina, and died in 1918.<ref name="bracey">Smith, Elaine.

==Career as an educator==
===Foundations with Lucy Craft Laney===
Bethune's first position as a teacher was for a brief time at her former elementary school in Sumter County.  In 1896, she began teaching at Haines Normal and Industrial Institute in [[Augusta, Georgia]] which was a Presbyterian mission school. It was founded and run by [[Lucy Craft Laney]] who impressed upon Bethune the foundations for her [[pedagogy]]. Laney was a former slave and ran her school with a [[Christian]] missionary zeal, emphasizing character and practical education for girls, but also accepted the boys who showed up on the steps of her school. Laney's mission was to better the perception that black people must fight their image of living with "shame and crime" through Christian moral education. Bethune spent only a year at Laney's school, but said of her experience, "I was impressed with her fearlessness, her amazing touch in every respect, an energy that seemed inexhaustible and her mighty power to command respect and admiration from her students and all who knew her. She handled her domain with the art of a master."<ref name="mccluskey1"/>

Bethune was influenced deeply by Laney and adopted many of her educational philosophies seeking to improve the conditions of black people by educating primarily women: "I believe that the greatest hope for the development of my race lies in training our women thoroughly and practically."<ref>Bethune, Mary (April 16, 1920). "Letter to the Editor" in ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>After one year at Haines, Bethune was transferred to the Kindell Institute in Sumter, South Carolina, where she met her husband.

===School in Daytona===
[[Image:Daytona School with Bethune.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|Mary McLeod Bethune with girls from the Literary and Industrial Training School for Negro Girls in Daytona, circa 1905.]]In October of 1904 she rented a small house for $11.00 per month, making benches and desks out of discarded crates and obtaining items through charity. During this same year Bethune used $1.50 US to start the Literary and Industrial Training School for Negro Girls in Daytona. She had six students - five girls aged six to twelve, and her son Albert. Bethune chose Daytona because its economic opportunities held more possibilities than Palatka: Daytona was a popular [[tourist]] destination. The school bordered Daytona's dump, and Bethune, parents, and church members raised money by making sweet potato pies, ice cream, and fried fish and selling them to construction crews. Ink for pens was made from [[elderberry]] juice, pencils from burned wood, and they scrounged local businesses for furniture. Bethune wrote later, "I considered cash money as the smallest part of my resources. I had faith in a loving God, faith in myself, and a desire to serve."<ref>Straub, Deborah, ed. "Mary McLeod Bethune." Contemporary Heroes and Heroines, Book II. Gale Research, 1992.</ref> The school received donations of money, equipment, and labor from local black churches. Bethune also courted wealthy white organizations like the ladies' Palmetto Club and asked powerful white men to sit on the board of the school; these included [[James Gamble]] (of [[Proctor & Gamble]]) and Thomas White (of White Sewing Machines). A 1912 visit from [[Booker T. Washington]] helped to impress upon her the importance of appealing to white [[benefactor]]s.<ref name="thomas"/> Bethune had first gone to see Washington in 1896 and was impressed by his clout with his donors. She later recalled a dream she had of Washington where he showed her a soiled handkerchief and pulled from it a large diamond and said, "Here, take this and build your school."<ref>Interview, Mary McLeod Bethune Oral History Interview. Oral History Project, MMBF, 1939, by Charles S Johnson. </ref>

Curriculum at the school started as a rigorous Christian life, having girls rise at 5:30 a.m. for Bible Study, classes in home economics and other industrial skills such as dressmaking, [[millinery]], cooking, and other crafts that emphasized a life of [[self-sufficiency]]. Students' days ended at 9 pm. Soon science and business courses were added, then high school courses of math, English, and foreign languages.<ref name="mccluskey1">McCluskey. Audrey. "We Specialize in the Wholly Impossible:" Black Women School Founders. ''Signs.'' Winter 1997. pp 403-426</ref>

[[Image:Daytona Normal School in 1919.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Group photo of students at the Literary and Industrial Training School for Negro Girls, taken about 1919.]]In 1910, the enrollment of the school rose to 102, most of them being boarders.<ref name="bracey"/> The success of the school was measured in its growing enrollment, addition of higher education courses, and the value of the school reaching $100,000 US by 1920, with an enrollment of 351 students.<ref name="thomas"/> Bethune renamed the school the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute and included courses to prepare teachers because she was finding difficulty staffing the school. The school merged with the Cookman Institute for Men from [[Jacksonville, Florida]] and became [[co-education]]al in 1923 and the value of the school's now eight buildings was reassessed at $250,000 US. The curriculum of the Bethune-Cookman School rivaled the [[racial segregation|segregated]] Daytona High School. In contrast, the Daytona Colored Public School neglected to provide education past the eighth grade until after 1920. An agent of the General Education Board noted that, "Daytona is probably the best school for Negroes in Florida."<ref name="bracey"/>

However, Bethune constantly found it necessary to search for more funding - almost everywhere she went in her travels she begged for money for the school. A donation by [[John D. Rockefeller]] in 1905 for $62,000 US helped, as did her friendship with the Roosevelts. Through the [[Great Depression]], the school was able to function meeting the educational standards of the State of Florida. From 1936-1942 she served only part-time as president of the college as she had duties in [[Washington, DC]], and the lower funding reflected her absence.<ref name="bracey"/> By 1942 Bethune was forced to give up the presidency of the school as it had begun to affect her health.

==Career as a public leader==
<!--- This section is hidden from readers until its formatting and citations can be improved
Four years after the Daytona School open its doors, the Afro-American Women<U+2019>s Club, later called the M.E.C. Smith Woman<U+2019>s Club, was organized as the first Black women<U+2019>s club in Florida <ref></ref>.  According to Wesley (1984) the club officially became the State Federation of Colored Women<U+2019>s Clubs on October 27, 1927 in Tampa, Hillsborough County, Florida.  The Florida Clubwomen worked:<blockquote>
# To develop and maintain higher and nobler ideals
# To promote civic movements
# To advocate the cause of welfare units that are organized for moral, religious, social, literary and inter-racial advancement or progress
# To make plans of recreation for young women for their religious, civic, moral, social and industrial uplift
# To encourage the organization of clubs where such organizations do not exist
# To assist local clubs or club women in becoming more thoroughly acquainted with various kinds of community work
# To foster and promote the organization of women<U+2019>s clubs in all parts of the State of Florida for the general and good betterment of humanity.<ref>Wesley, p. </ref></blockquote>

In 1916, Bethune became president of the Florida Federation and in two decades, under her leadership, the Federation grew to include more than 60 clubs, in at least 20 cities, with at least 13 members in each<ref>Wesley, p. </ref><ref>McCluskey and Smith, p. </ref>.  It was also under her tenure that Mary<U+2019>s commitment to education was once again demonstrated.  The Federation and Mary bought and led a home for delinquent girls in [[Ocala, Florida]].<ref>Wesley, p. .</ref>  The Home for Delinquent Girls <U+201C>offered an alternative to incarceration with adults for up to twelve young black girls and women<U+201D>.<ref> Hanson, 2003, p. 98.</ref>  According to Hanson the four focal areas of   Bethune<U+2019>s leadership included internal organization, American involvement in World War I, women's suffrage, and Interracial Cooperation.

The work that Mrs. Bethune was able to accomplish under the Florida Federation is incredibly extensive, but not surprising.  Within each focal area there were numerous accomplishments.  According to Hanson Bethune organized the Florida Club to operate in a <U+201C>businesslike<U+201D> manner<ref>Hanson, p.96.</ref>  The Club produced a newsletter, drafted a constitution, and held club conventions and was politically active.  Mary was a <U+201C>field representative for black women on the Women<U+2019>s Committee of the Council of National Defense<U+201D> and through this role the Florida Federation of Women<U+2019>s Clubs were able to organize a Daytona Beach chapter of the Circle of Negro War Relief (CNWR)<ref name="hanson97">Hanson, p.97</ref>.  The CNWR <U+201C>promoted black women<U+2019>s participation in the war effort<U+201D><ref name="hanson97"/> and was designed to meet the needs of Black veterans.  Bethune, along with CNWR, and the Florida Club encouraged the entire Black community to get involved.  This represents yet another example of Mary<U+2019>s commitment to uplift the entire community and it was creative and appropriate to recruit members of the Black community to play a role in their own deliverance.  They conducted voluntary food conservation drives, taught community members how to can and preserve food, and conducted fundraising efforts through food sales<ref>Hanson, p. .</ref>  The CNWR also established home demonstration and public health programs, improved recreational facilities and playgrounds for children, and the Mutual Protection League for Working Girls.<ref>Hanson, p. .</ref>

Bethune and the Florida Club women also <U+201C>established Hostess Houses, became Traveler<U+2019>s Aid workers ... and worked with Red Cross chapters to promote the inclusion of black nurses whenever possible<U+201D>. <ref name="hanson97"/>  The women also created care packages for the black men serving in the war.  They <U+201C>knitted goods for solders, supplied comfort kits, gum, records, phonographs, and home-cooked dinners, and gave lectures on social hygiene and race pride<U+201D>.<ref name="hanson97"/>. Bethune even supported the efforts of the women's suffrage movement in 1920 when she organized a voter<U+2019>s registration drive at her school.  --->

===National Association of Colored Women===
In 1896, the [[National Association of Colored Women]] (NACW) was formed to promote the dual needs of black women. Bethune served as the Florida chapter president of the NACW from 1917-1925 and made it a mission to register as many black voters as possible, which prompted several visits from the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<ref name="bracey"/><ref name="usca"/> Bethune served as the president of the Southeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs from 1920-1925, an organization that served to amplify black women's voices for better opportunities. Her presence in the organization earned her the NACW national presidency in 1924. Despite the NACW being underfunded, Bethune's vision of the organization having a headquarters with a professional executive secretary came to fruition under her leadership when the organization purchased a Washington DC property at 1318 Vermont Avenue (with half the [[mortgage]] paid). Just prior to her leaving the presidency of the NACW, she saw it become the first black-controlled organization represented in Washington, DC.

She was invited to attend the Child Welfare Conference called by President [[Calvin Coolidge]] in 1928. In 1930 [[Herbert Hoover]] appointed her to the White House Conference on Child Health.

===National Council of Negro Women===
[[Image:Bethune at White House 1950.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|Mary McLeod Bethune enters the [[White House]] circa 1950.]]Bethune founded the [[National Council of Negro Women]] in [[New York City]] in 1935 bringing together 28 different organizations to form a council to facilitate the improvement of quality of life for women and their communities. About the organization, Bethune stated: "It is our pledge to make a lasting contribution to all that is finest and beastly in America, to cherish and enrich her heritage of freedom and progress by working for the [[Racial integration|integration]] of all her people regardless of race, creed, or national origin, into her spiritual, social, cultural, civic, and economic life, and thus aid her to achieve the glorious destiny of a true and unfettered [[democracy]]."<ref name="ncnw">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncnw.org/about/history.htm|title=National Council of Negro Women History}} NCNW website. Retrieved on January 11, 2008.</ref> In 1938, the NCNW hosted the White House Conference on Negro Women and Children significantly displaying the presence of black women in democratic roles. They claimed their biggest impact came in getting black women into military officer roles in the [[Women's Army Corps]] during World War II.<ref name="bracey"/>

===National Youth Administration===
The [[National Youth Administration]] was a federal agency created in 1935 to help youth aged 16 - 24 with [[unemployment]] and limited opportunities during the Great Depression. Bethune lobbied the organization so aggressively and effectively for minority involvement that she earned herself a full-time staff position in 1936 as an assistant. Within two years, the agency upgraded her role to Director of Negro Affairs. She was responsible for releasing NYA funds to help black students through school based programs. She was the only black agent of the NYA who was releasing funds. Bethune made sure that black colleges participated in the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]], which graduated some of the first black pilots.<ref name="bracey"/> Awed by her accomplishments, the director of the NYA, said in 1939 of Bethune, "No one can do what Mrs. Bethune can do."<ref name="smithel">Smith, Elaine (Winter, 1996). "Mary McLeod Bethune's 'Last Will and Testament': A Legacy for Race Vindication." ''Journal of Negro History''. '''8''' (1/4) p. 105<U+2013>122</ref>

=== Black Cabinet ===
Bethune played a dual role as close and loyal friend of [[Eleanor Roosevelt|Eleanor]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]]. Eleanor Roosevelt respected Bethune to the extent that the [[racial segregation|segregation]] rules at the Southern Conference on Human Welfare in 1938, being held in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], were changed on Roosevelt's request so she could sit next to Bethune. Roosevelt frequently referred to Bethune as "her closest friend in her age group."<ref>National Park Service {{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/elro/teach-er-vk/lesson-plans/notes-er-and-civil-rights.htm|title=National  Eleanor Roosevelt and Civil Rights}} Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site website. Retrieved on January 11, 2008.</ref> Bethune, in her turn took it upon herself to disperse the message of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to black voters, and make the concerns of black people known to the Roosevelts at the same time. She had unprecedented access to the [[White House]] through her relationship with the First Lady. She used it to form a coalition of leaders from black organizations called the Federal Council on Negro Affairs, but which came to be known as the [[Black Cabinet]].<ref name="bracey"/>
The role of the Black Cabinet was to serve as an advisory board to the Roosevelt administration on issues facing black people in America. It gathered talented blacks in positions within federal agencies, creating the first collective of black people enjoying higher positions in government than ever before. It also served to show to voters that the Roosevelt administration cared about black concerns. The group gathered in Bethune's office or apartment and met informally, rarely keeping minutes. Although as advisers they had little role in creating public policy, they were a respected leadership among black voters and were able to influence political appointments and disbursement of funds to organizations that would benefit black people.<ref>Weiss, Nancy.

===Civil Rights===
When the [[Methodist Church]] facilitated the merging of the Daytona Normal and Industrial School and the Cookman College for Men into Bethune-Cookman College, Bethune became a member of the church. However, the church was largely segregated in the South, forming two separate denominations. Bethune was prominent in the primarily black Florida Conference, and though she worked to integrate the mostly white [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], South, she protested initial plans for integration because they required separate jurisdictions based on race.<ref>"Mary McLeod Bethune." ''Religious Leaders of America'', 2nd ed. Gale Group, 1999.</ref>

She dedicated her life to the education of both whites and blacks about the accomplishments and needs of black people, writing in 1938, "If our people are to fight their way up out of bondage we must arm them with the sword and the shield and buckler of pride - belief in themselves and their possibilities, based upon a sure knowledge of the achievements of the past."<ref name="bethuneJNH1938">Bethune, Mary (January, 1938). "Clarifying our Vision With the Facts." ''Journal of Negro History''; '''23''' (1) p. 10<U+2013>15</ref> and a year later, "Not only the Negro child but children of all races should read and know of the achievements, accomplishments and deeds of the Negro. World peace and brotherhood are based on a common understanding of the contributions and cultures of all races and creeds."<ref name="bethuneJNh1939">Bethune, Mary (January, 1939). "The Adaptation of the History of the Negro to the Capacity of the Child." ''Journal of Negro History.'' '''24''' (1) p. 9<U+2013>13</ref>

One of her most effective methods of reaching this goal was to open her school on Sundays to tourists in Daytona Beach, showing off the accomplishments of her students, hosting national speakers on black issues, and taking donations. These Community Meetings were deliberately integrated. One black teenager in Daytona at the turn of the 20th century remembers that as the most impressive aspect: "Many tourists attended, sitting wherever there were empty seats. There was no special section for white people."<ref name="smithel"/>

On the turnover of ''[[Plessy v Ferguson]]'' by the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]], Bethune took the opportunity to defend the decision by writing her opinion in the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' in 1954: 

<blockquote>There can be no divided democracy, no class government, no half-free county, under the constitution. Therefore, there can be no discrimination, no segregation, no separation of some citizens from the rights which belong to all... We are on our way. But these are frontiers which we must conquer... We must gain full equality in education ...in the franchise... in economic opportunity, and full equality in the abundance of life.</blockquote>

On May 18, 1955, Bethune died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Her death was followed by editorial tributes in newspapers all over America. The [[Oklahoma City]] ''Black Dispatch'' stated she was, "Exhibit No. 1 for all who have faith in American and the democratic process." The ''Atlanta Daily World'' said her life was, "One of the most dramatic careers ever enacted at any time upon the stage of human activity." And in the ''Pittsburgh Courier'', it was stated, "In any race or nation she would have been an outstanding personality and made a noteworthy contribution because her chief attribute was her indomitable soul." The mainstream press praised her as well. ''[[Christian Century]]'' suggested, "the story of her life should be taught every school child for generations to come." The ''[[New York Times]]'' noted she was, "one of the most potent factors in the growth of interracial goodwill in America." The ''[[Washington Post]]'' read, "So great were her dynamism and force that it was almost impossible to resist her... Not only her own people, but all America has been enriched and ennobled by her courageous, ebullient spirit." Her hometown newspaper, the ''Daytona Beach Evening News'' printed, "To some she seemed unreal, something that could not be... What right had she to greatness?... The lesson of Mrs. Bethune's life is that genius knows no racial barriers."<ref name="bracey"/>

== Personal life ==
Bethune stood five feet four inches tall and cut a matronly figure even in her 30s. Unlike other black personalities who were effective in part for their lighter skin, Bethune was notable for how dark her skin actually was; she was often described as "[[ebony]]" in complexion.

She carried a cane with her, not for support but for effect. She said it gave her "swank". She was a [[teetotaler]] and preached [[Temperance movement|temperance]] for African Americans, taking opportunities to chastise drunken blacks she encountered in public.<ref name="bracey"/> Bethune stated more than once that the school and the students in Daytona were her first family and that her son and extended family came second. Her students often referred to her as "Mama Bethune."

Her effectiveness in getting what she wanted was duly noted throughout her life. Dr. Robert Weaver, who served with her on Roosevelt's Black Cabinet said of her, "She had the most marvelous gift of effecting feminine helplessness in order to attain her aims with masculine ruthlessness."<ref>Weaver, Robert (July 10, 1974). "Her Boys Remember." ''Time.'' (special publication of the National Council of Negro Women).</ref> But when a white Daytona resident threatened Bethune's students who walked in front of his home with a Winchester rifle, Bethune made it a priority to assuage his anger. The director of the McLeod Hospital recalled that, "Mrs. Bethune treated him with courtesy and developed such goodwill in him that we found him protecting the children and going so far as to say, 'If anybody bothers old Mary, I will protect her with my life.'"<ref>Adams, Texas, "As I Recollect," typescript, BF.</ref>

Self-sufficiency was a high priority throughout her life. Bethune invested in several businesses in her life including the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]'', a black newspaper, and several life insurance companies, one of which she began: Central Life Insurance of Florida. When blacks were not allowed to visit the beach, she and several other business owners invested in Paradise Beach, purchasing a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of beach and the surrounding properties, splitting it up and selling it to black families, and allowing white families to visit. Paradise Beach was later renamed to Bethune-Volusia Beach. She also was a part of the Welricha Motel in Daytona, of which she was one-fourth owner.<ref name="smithel"/><ref>Grimson, Matt (October 13, 2003){{cite news|url=http://web.naplesnews.com/03/10/florida/e19482a.htm|title=Historically black beach disappears with integration}} ''Naples Daily News''.
