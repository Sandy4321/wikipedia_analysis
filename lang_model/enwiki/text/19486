'''Thomas John Brokaw''' (born [[February 6]], [[1940]] in [[Webster, South Dakota]]) is a popular USA [[television]] [[journalist]], presently working on regularly scheduled news documentaries for the NBC television network, and is the former [[NBC News]] [[anchorman]] and managing editor of the program ''[[NBC Nightly News|NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw]]''. His last broadcast as anchorman was on [[December 1]], [[2004]], succeeded by [[Brian Williams (news anchor)|Brian Williams]] in a carefully planned transition. In the later part of Tom Brokaw's tenure, ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' became most watched cable or broadcast news program in the [[United States]]. Brokaw also hosted, wrote, and moderated special programs on a wide range of topics.  Throughout his career, he has been the recipient of numerous awards and honors.

Brokaw serves on the [[Howard University]] School of Communications Board of Visitors and on the boards of trustees of the [[University of South Dakota]], the [[Norton Simon Museum]], and the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. As well as his television journalism, he has written for periodicals and has authored books.

== Early life ==

Tom Brokaw was born in [[Webster, South Dakota]] and graduated from Yankton High Senior High School in [[Yankton, South Dakota]], where he partnered with Tim Willert in Debate. According to debate-team legend, his wife was a better debater than he was. As a [[high school]] student, Brokaw was governor of [[South Dakota]] [[Boy's State]], and in that right, he accompanied then [[South Dakota]] [[Governor]] [[Joe Foss]] to [[New York City]] for a joint appearance on a TV [[game show]].  It was to be the beginning of a long relationship with Foss, whom Brokaw would later feature in his book about [[World War II]] [[veterans]], ''[[The Greatest Generation]]''. 

In early life he was burdened with a cleft lip, and though he had a surgery to correct it early in life, it scarred his speech forever.

Brokaw started his collegiate studies at the [[University of Iowa]] from 1958 to 1959 where he says he majored in "beer and coeds". [http://www.nndb.com/people/309/000022243/] Brokaw dropped out there and then transferred to the [[University of South Dakota]] where he studied [[political science]], worked as a [[radio]] reporter from 1959 to 1962, and was affectionately nicknamed "Two Point Tom" - a derogatory reference toward his [[GPA]]. 

He has been married to [[Meredith Lynn Auld]] (a former Miss South Dakota and author) since 1962. They have three daughters.

== Career ==

His television career began at [[KTIV]] in [[Sioux City, Iowa]], followed by a three-year stint at [[KMTV]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. [http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/B/htmlB/brokawtom/brokawtom.htm]

In 1965, he became an editor and [[anchorman]] of the late-evening news on WSB-TV in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].  The following year he joined [[NBC]] News, reporting from [[California]] and anchoring for KNBC in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. From 1973-1976 he was an NBC News [[White House]] correspondent, covering the [[Watergate scandal]]. During this time, he was asked by the higher-rated [[CBS News]] to join it after CBS's management had decided its reporter, [[Dan Rather]], was too hostile to then-President Richard Nixon. The switch never happened after word of it was leaked to the press.

In 1976, Brokaw became NBC News' ''[[The Today Show|Today Show]]'' host. He was also the floor reporter for the two major parties' presidential nominating conventions. In 1981, Brokaw began co-anchoring NBC Nightly News, along with co-anchor [[Roger Mudd]]. When Mudd went on to host Meet the Press and American Almanac, a weekly newsmagazine,  Brokaw became the sole anchor of the ''NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw'' on [[September 5]], [[1983]].

In 1987, he wrote '''The Arms, the Men, the Money''', investigating [[Contra]] rebels. That same year he conducted the first one-on-one [[United States|American]] TV interview with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and won an A.I.duPont-Columbia University Award. He also moderated the debates among all declared presidential candidates of both parties.

In 1989, he reported  the collapse of the [[Berlin Wall]]. From 1992-1993 he anchored ''[[The Brokaw Report]]'' series of prime-time "critical issues" specials. He was also host, with [[Katie Couric]], of a prime-time [[newsmagazine]] called ''[[Now with Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric|Now]]''. The show aired from 1993-1994, and was folded into the multi-night Dateline NBC program.

In 1995, Brokaw reported from the site of the [[Oklahoma City bombing]]. The following year he reported from the scene of the [[TWA flight 800]] tragedy. 

In 1997, he interviewed [[Charlie Trie]] and [[Johnny Chung]], key figures in the campaign finance abuse scandal.

In 1999, he conducted the first [[North America]]n TV interview with [[Prime Minister of Russia|Russian Prime Minister]] [[Yevgeny Primakov]], in [[Moscow]]. He also traveled to [[Tirana]], [[Albania]] during [[NATO]] airstrikes in [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

In 2000, he conducted the first American TV interview with [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]], in Moscow.  He was also Master of Ceremonies at the opening of the [[National D-Day Museum]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].

In September 2001, a letter containing [[anthrax]] was addressed to him as part of the [[2001 anthrax attacks]]. Brokaw wasn't harmed, but two NBC News employees were infected.

In 2002, Brokaw announced his intention to retire as anchor of the [[NBC Nightly News]] after the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential election]]. NBC then announced that [[Brian Williams (news anchor)|Brian Williams]] would replace Brokaw as the anchor of ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' on [[December 2]], [[2004]]. NBC also announced that Brokaw will remain with the network in a part-time capacity through 2014 serving as an analyst and producing documentary programs.

By the end of his time as Nightly News anchor, Brokaw was regarded as the most popular news personality in the United States. His program was consistently rated the highest evening news show,  topping [[Dan Rather]] and the late [[Peter Jennings]] in the evening news ratings. This may explain why Brokaw was the only one of the three evening news anchors granted a sit-down interview with President [[George W. Bush]].

Along with the two other pillars of the so-called "Big Three" <U+2014> [[Peter Jennings]] (ABC) and [[Dan Rather]] (CBS) - Brokaw had ushered in the era of the TV news anchor as lavishly compensated, globe-trotting star in the 1980s. The magnitude of a news event could be measured by whether Brokaw and his counterparts on the other two networks showed up on the scene. Brokaw's retirement in December 2004, followed by Rather's ouster from the CBS Evening news in March 2005, and finally Jennings's death on August 7, 2005, brought that era to a close.

He closed his final Nightly News broadcast in front of 15.7 million viewers on NBC by saying:

:"That's ''Nightly News'' for this Wednesday night. I'm Tom Brokaw. You'll see Brian Williams here tomorrow night; and I'll see you along the way."

=== Ratings ===

By the time American viewers became familiar with Tom Brokaw and his ''NBC Nightly News'' the program  was consistently ranked #1, [[Peter Jennings]] and ''[[World News Tonight]]'' was ranked #2, [[Dan Rather]] and the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' was ranked #3. Earlier in his career, CBS under Cronkite and Rather was #1 in the early and mid 1980s, Jennings was #1 in the late 1980s and mid 1990s, and Brokaw took over as America's most watched anchor in the late 1990s, holding the spot until his retirement in 2004.

== Present ==

Tom Brokaw is the second journalist to get ever an award from the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, the [[Sylvanus Thayer Award]]. The first one was legendary news anchor man [[Walter Cronkite]] in [[1997]].

He is presently on the board of directors of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] and the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]].

Some political independents, Libertarians, Reform party members and Green Party members have publicly urged Tom Brokaw to run as their candidate for national office: U.S. Senate, or President.

Brokaw recently completed a documentary on global warming for the Discovery Channel entitled Global Warming: What You Need to Know, with Tom Brokaw [http://www.cutco2.org/2006/07/tom-brokaw-gets-involved.html].

There are several homages of Mr. Brokaw to date. On several episodes of [[Ozzy & Drix]], there is a Nerve News Network reporter named Tom Bronchia, who has a very similar voice style to Mr. Brokaw.  

Former [[Saturday Night Live|SNL]] cast members [[Chris Parnell]] and [[Dana Carvey]] have both performed notable Brokaw impersonations. 

''[[The Simpsons]]'' also pokes fun at Mr. Brokaw in several episodes.  One such episode was of a Civil War reenactment, where Brokaw's character is giving a speech praising the World War II veterans (a reference to his ''The Greatest Generation'' book).  When the WWII veterans march off to break up the Civil War reenactment, Grandpa Simpson yells, "I want a back massage afterwards!"  Brokaw gets down on one knee and says, "Yes, master."

[[The Howard Stern Show]] often plays a sound clip taken from an August 2004 NBC Nighly Newscast where Mr. Brokaw accidentally says something resembling [[bukkake]] while trying to pronounce the name of the Russian city of "Buchalki."

In Robert Altman's ''[[Cookie's Fortune]]'', the Willis Richland character is "responsible and hence does not drink before Tom Brokaw".

In a recent episode of [[Family Guy]], Brokaw's pronunciation of words containing the letter "L" was repeatedly satirized.
