The '''Appalachian National Scenic Trail''', generally known as the '''Appalachian Trail''' or simply the '''AT''', is a marked [[hiking]] trail in the eastern [[United States]] extending between [[Springer Mountain]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Mount Katahdin]] in [[Maine]].<ref name=OFAQ>Gailey, Chris (2006).

''[[Audubon]]''. '''87''' (1):140-141</ref><ref name=applebome/>  The majority of the trail is in [[wilderness]], although some portions do traverse towns and roads, and cross rivers.

The Appalachian Trail is famous for its many hikers, some of whom, called [[thru-hiking|thru-hikers]], attempt to hike it in its entirety in a single season. Many books, memoirs, web sites and fan organizations are dedicated to this pursuit. Along the way, the trail passes through the states of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], [[Maryland]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York]], [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Maine]]. An extension, the [[International Appalachian Trail]], continues north into [[Canada]] and to the end of the range, where it enters the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

The Appalachian Trail, the [[Continental Divide Trail]] and the [[Pacific Crest Trail]] form the [[Triple Crown of Hiking|Triple Crown]] of long distance hiking in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.internationalat.org/Pages/SIAIAT_News/I010CF339 | title=Nimblewill Nomad Receives Triple Crown Award | accessdate=27 November 2008 | work=International Appalachian Trail}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20011027/aponline213001_001.htm|title=Hiker Achieves 'Triple Crown' |last=Adams|first=Glenn|date=October 27, 2001|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2008-11-27}}</ref>

==History==
The trail was conceived by [[Benton MacKaye]], a forester who wrote his original plan shortly after the death of his wife in 1921. MacKaye's idea detailed a grand trail that would connect a series of farms and wilderness work/study camps for city-dwellers. In 1922, at the suggestion of Major [[William A. Welch]], director of the [[Palisades Interstate Park Commission]], his idea was publicized by [[Raymond H. Torrey]] with a story in the ''[[New York Evening Post]]'' under a full-page banner headline reading "A Great Trail from Maine to Georgia!" The idea was quickly adopted by the new [[Palisades Interstate Park Trail Conference]] as their main project.

[[Image:Bear Mtn Bridge.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[Bear Mountain Bridge]]]]On October 7, 1923, the first section of the trail, from [[Bear Mountain State Park|Bear Mountain]] west through [[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]] to [[Arden, New York]], was opened. MacKaye then called for a two-day Appalachian Trail conference to be held in March 1925 in [[Washington, D.C.]] This resulted in the formation of the [[Appalachian Trail Conservancy|Appalachian Trail Conference]] (now called the Appalachian Trail Conservancy), though little progress was made on the trail for several years. 

At the end of the 1920s and beginning of the 1930s, a retired judge named [[Arthur Perkins (Connecticut judge)|Arthur Perkins]] and his younger associate [[Myron Avery]] took up the cause. In 1929, Perkins, who was also a member of the [[Connecticut Forest and Park Association]] and its Blue Blazed Trails committee, found a willing volunteer in state to further the project. [[Nestell Kipp Anderson|Ned Anderson]], a farmer in [[Sherman, Connecticut]], took on (as a member of both organizations) the task of mapping and blazing the [[Connecticut]] leg of the trail (1929<U+2013>1933). It ran from [[List of county routes in Dutchess County, New York|Dog Tail Corners]] in [[Dover, New York|Webatuck, New York]], which borders [[Kent, Connecticut]], at Ashley Falls, {{convert|50|mi}} through the northwest corner of the state, up to [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] at the [[Massachusetts]] border.<ref>[http://www.doristomaselli.net/BookNews.htm Tomaselli, Doris. 2009. pp. 47-61 ''Ned Anderson: Connecticut<U+2019>s Appalachian Trailblazer <U+2013> Small Town Renaissance Man''. Sherman Historical Society. Sherman, CT. ISBN 978-0-615-28611-2.]</ref> (A portion of the Connecticut trail has since been rerouted [1979-83] to be more scenic [more byway, less highway] and now includes a Ned K. Anderson Memorial Bridge.)<ref>[http://www.doristomaselli.net/BookNews.htm Tomaselli, Doris. 2009. pp. 67-75 ''Ned Anderson: Connecticut<U+2019>s Appalachian Trailblazer <U+2013> Small Town Renaissance Man''. Sherman Historical Society. Sherman, CT. ISBN 978-0-615-28611-2.]</ref> 

Anderson<U+2019>s efforts helped spark renewed interest in the trail, and Avery (leading the charge since Perkins<U+2019> death in 1932) was able to bring other states onboard. Upon taking over the ATC, Avery adopted the more practical goal of building a simple hiking trail. He and MacKaye clashed over the ATC's response to a major commercial development along the trail's path; MacKaye left the organization, while Avery was willing to simply reroute the trail. Avery reigned as Chairman of the ATC from 1932 to 1952 (he died that same year) and proved himself as an indomitable force for - and fierce advocate of - the trail. 

Avery became the first to walk the trail end-to-end, though not as a [[Thru-hiking|thru-hike]], in 1936. In August 1937, the trail was completed to [[Sugarloaf Mountain (Franklin County, Maine)|Sugarloaf Mountain]] in Maine, and the ATC shifted its focus toward protecting the trail lands and mapping the trail for hikers. From 1938 to the end of [[World War II]], the trail suffered a series of natural and man-made setbacks. At the end of the war, the damage to the trail was repaired.

In 1948, [[Earl Shaffer]] of [[York, Pennsylvania]], brought a great deal of attention to the project by completing the first documented thru-hike.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/documentsgallery/exhibitions/appalachian_trail_1.html | title=Smithsonian exhibit on Shaffer's 1948 hike | accessdate=4 December 2009}}]</ref> Later Shaffer also completed the first north-to-south thru-hike, making him the first to do so in each direction.<ref name="Shaffer">{{Cite journal|title=Walking With Spring|author=Earl V. Shaffer|year=2004|isbn= 0917953843|postscript=.}}</ref> In 1998 Mr. Shaffer, nearly 80 years old, again hiked the entirety of the trail, making him the oldest person ever to complete a thru-hike.<ref name="shaffer">{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E4D81639F931A25756C0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1|title=Earl Shaffer, First to Hike Length of Appalachian Trail in Both Directions, Dies at 83 |last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=May 12, 2002|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=2008-11-16}}</ref><ref> (October 26, 1998), "Etceteras". ''Christian Science Monitor''. '''90''' (232):2</ref>

In 1994, a story appeared in the ''Appalachian Trailway News'' describing a 121-day Maine to Georgia thru-hike in 1936 by six [[Scouting in New York|Boy Scouts]] from the [[Bronx]].<ref>[http://www.backcountry.net/arch/at/0206/msg00818.html [at-l&#93; ATN article, 1936 Scout Hike<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Although the story has been accepted by some members of ALDHA,<ref>http://www.aldha.org/newsletr/sum00.pdf</ref> a great deal of doubt has also been expressed and<ref>http://www.appalachiantrail.org/atf/cf/%7BD25B4747-42A3-4302-8D48-EF35C0B0D9F1%7D/ATN00Nov.pdf, p. 4</ref> this earlier thru-hike has never been verified . Shaffer's 1948 journey is still generally recognized as the first A.T. thru-hike.

In the 1960s, the ATC made progress toward protecting the trail from development, thanks to efforts of politicians and officials. The [[National Trails System Act of 1968]] designated the Pacific Crest Trail and Appalachian Trail as the first national scenic trails and paved the way for a series of [[National Scenic Trail]]s within the [[national parks (United States)|National Park]] and National Forest systems.<ref>Seaborg, Eric (July/August 1984), "The Road Less Traveled". ''National Parks''. '''58''' (7/8) :34-35</ref> Trail volunteers worked with the [[National Park Service]] to map a permanent route for the trail, and by 1971 a permanent route had been marked (though minor changes continue to this day). By the close of the 20th century, the Park Service had completed the purchase of all but a few miles of the trail's span.

===Extensions===
The [[International Appalachian Trail]] is a {{convert|1900|mi|km|sing=on}} extension running north from Maine into [[New Brunswick]] and [[Quebec]]. It is a separate trail, not an official extension of the Appalachian Trail.<ref>Hughes, C.J. (September 27, 2002), "After 2,169 Miles, What's Another 690?". ''New York Times''. '''152''' (52254):F1</ref> A further extension to [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] has recently been completed. In 2010, a group of geologists representing the International Appalachian Trail began a push to extend the trail across the Atlantic Ocean, across [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]] in the [[North Atlantic]] and into [[Northern Europe]], then down to the [[Atlas Mountains]] of [[Morocco]].<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/8828574.stm</ref>

In 2008, the [[Pinhoti Trail]] in Alabama was connected to the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail via the [[Benton MacKaye Trail]].

== Flora and fauna==
The Appalachian Trail is home to thousands of species of plants and animals, including 2,000 distinct rare, threatened, endangered, and sensitive plant and animal species.<ref name="ATE"/>

=== Animals ===
[[Image:Black bear large.jpg|thumb|The [[American black bear]], one of the largest animals on the Appalachian Trail.]]The [[American black bear]] (''Ursus americanus'') is the largest omnivore that may be encountered on the trail, and it inhabits all regions of the Appalachians.<ref name=TPBB>Wingfoot [http://www.trailplace.com/portal/article_nature.php?id=22&topic%5Bname%5D=Mammals&topic%5Btopicid%5D=3 "Black Bears on the Appalachian Trail"] TrailPlace.com (accessed September 14, 2006)</ref>  Bear sightings on the trail are uncommon, and confrontations rarer still.<ref>[http://appalachiantrail.org/atf/cf/%7BB8A229E6-1CDC-41B7-A615-2D5911950E45%7D/Black%20Bear%20Neighborhood%20ATJournesyMayJune2010.pdf Bear sightings on the Trail </ref>
Other hazards include venomous snakes, including the Eastern [[Crotalus horridus|timber rattlesnake]] and [[Agkistrodon contortrix|copperhead]], which are common along the trail. Both snakes are generally found in drier, rockier sections of the trail; the copperhead's range extends north to around the [[New Jersey]]-[[New York]] state line, while rattlesnakes are commonly found along the trail in [[Connecticut]] and have been reported, although rarely, as far north as [[New Hampshire]].<ref name=AnimalFAQ>[http://www.appalachiantrail.org/site/c.jkLXJ8MQKtH/b.1080243/k.832E/Wildlife_FAQ.htm Appalachian Trail Conservancy Wildlife FAQ]</ref> Other large fauna include [[White-tailed deer|deer]];<ref name=stroh/> [[elk]], reintroduced in the [[Great Smoky Mountains|Smoky Mountains]]; and [[moose]], which live as far south as [[Massachusetts]] but are more commonly seen in northern [[New England]].<ref name=AnimalFAQ/>[[Image:Timber Rattlesnake.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Crotalus horridus|timber rattlesnake]] among the leaves]]

For most hikers, the most persistent pests along the trail are [[mice]]<U+2014>which inhabit shelters<U+2014>and bugs<U+2014>which includes [[tick]]s, [[mosquito]]s, and [[black flies]].

=== Plants ===
Plant life along the trail is varied. The trail passes through several different biomes from south to north, and the climate changes significantly, particularly dependent upon elevation. In the south, lowland forests consist mainly of second-growth; nearly the entire trail has been logged at one time or another. There are, however, a few old growth locations along the trail, such as [[Sages Ravine]] in Massachusetts and "The Hermitage", near [[Gulf Hagas]] in Maine. In the south, the forest is dominated by hardwoods, including [[oak]] and [[Liriodendron tulipifera|tulip trees]], also known as yellow poplar.<ref name=PlantFAQ>[http://www.appalachiantrail.org/site/c.jkLXJ8MQKtH/b.1080155/k.F2A6/Plant_FAQ.htm Appalachian Trail Conservancy Plant FAQ]</ref> Further north, tulip trees are gradually replaced by [[maple|maples]] and [[birch|birches]]. Oaks begin to disappear in Massachusetts. By Vermont, the lowland forest is made up of maples, birch and [[beech]], which provide spectacular foliage displays for hikers in September and October.<ref name=colorful>Stroh, Bess Zarafonitis (September/October 1998), "Colorful climbs". ''National Parks''. '''72''' (9/10):34-37</ref>  While the vast majority of lowland forest south of the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] is hardwood, many areas have some [[coniferous]] trees as well, and in Maine, these often grow at low elevations.<ref name=PlantFAQ/>

There is a drastic change between the lowland and [[subalpine]], [[evergreen]] forest, as well as another, higher break, at [[tree line]], above which only hardy alpine plants grow.<ref name=PlantFAQ/> The sub-alpine region is far more prevalent along the trail than true alpine conditions. While it mainly exists in the north, a few mountains in the south have subalpine environments, which are typically coated in an ecosystem known as the [[Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest]]. Southern ranges and mountains where sub-alpine environments occur include the [[Great Smoky Mountains]], where sub-alpine environments only begin around {{convert|6000|ft|m}} in elevation, [[Roan Highlands]] on the [[North Carolina]]-[[Tennessee]] border, where sub-alpine growth descends below {{convert|6000|ft|m}}, and [[Mount Rogers]] and the [[Grayson Highlands]] in [[Virginia]], where there is some alpine growth above {{convert|5000|ft|m}}.  [[Appalachian balds]] are also found in the Southern highlands, and are believed to occur due to fires or grazing in recent centuries, or in some cases due to thin, sandy soils. Several balds are sprouting trees, and on some, the [[United States National Forest|National Forest]] service actually mows the grasses periodically in order to keep the balds free of trees.

== Topography ==
[[Image:Appalachian map.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Diagram of the [[Appalachian Mountain system]]]]No sub-alpine regions exist between [[Mount Rogers]] in Virginia and [[Mount Greylock]] in Massachusetts, mainly because the trail stays below {{convert|3000|ft|m}} from [[Shenandoah National Park]] in Virginia to Mount Greylock. Mount Greylock, however, has a large subalpine region, the only such forest in Massachusetts, extending down to {{convert|3000|ft|m}}, which in the south would be far from the sub-alpine cutoff. This is especially low because Greylock is exposed to prevailing westerly winds, as its summit rises {{convert|1000|ft|m}} higher than any other peak in Massachusetts. Further north, several peaks in Vermont reach into the sub-alpine zone, the bottom of which steadily descends, so that by the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] in New Hampshire, it often occurs well below {{convert|3000|ft|m}}. At [[Mount Moosilauke]], which reaches to {{convert|4802|ft|m}}, the first [[alpine climate|alpine]] environment on the trail is reached, where only thin, sporadic flora is interspersed with bare rocks. Between the two regions is the [[krummholz]] region, where stunted trees grow with their branches oriented away from the winter's prevailing northwest wind, thus giving the appearance of flags (they are often called "flag trees"). This region resembles lowland terrain hundreds of miles north in Canada. It also contains many endangered and threatened species. The trail has been rerouted over New Hampshire's [[Presidential Range]] so the [[Appalachian Mountain Club]] can protect certain plant life. The alpine cutoff in the Whites is generally between 4,200 and {{convert|4800|ft|m}}. Mountains traversed by the AT above treeline include [[Mount Moosilauke]], several miles along the [[Franconia Range]], and the [[Presidential Range]]. In the Presidentials, the trail climbs as high as {{convert|6288|ft}} on [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]] and spends about {{convert|13|mi|km}} continuously above treeline, in the largest alpine environment in the United States east of the [[Rocky Mountains]].

In Maine, the trail extends into even harsher environments, and sub-alpine and alpine growth descends to lower elevations. Alpine growth in the state ranges from around {{convert|2500|ft|m}} in the [[Mahoosuc Range]] to below {{convert|1000|ft|m}} in parts of the [[Hundred-Mile Wilderness]],<ref name=brill>Brill, David (June 2001), "Walk This Way!". ''Men's Health''. '''16''' (5):68</ref> where nearly every area higher than {{convert|1000|ft|m}} is evergreen forest. These forests include more species of evergreen, as well. In addition to the [[Eastern White Pine|white pine]], [[spruce]] and [[tsuga|hemlock]] prevalent further south, Maine has many [[Cedrus|cedar]] trees along the trail. Near the northern terminus, there are even some [[tamarack]] (larch), a coniferous, pine-needled deciduous tree, which provides displays of yellow in the late fall after the birches and maples have gone bare. The hemlocks in Maine are also notable, as the [[Hemlock woolly adelgid|woolly adelgid]], which has ravaged populations further south, has not come into the state yet, and may be unable to make it so far north due to the cold climate.

Maine also has several alpine regions. In addition to several areas of the Mahoosuc Range, the Baldpates and Old Blue in southern Maine have alpine characteristics despite elevations below {{convert|4000|ft|m}}. [[Saddleback Mountain (Rangeley, Maine)|Saddleback Mountain]] and [[Mount Bigelow (Maine)|Mount Bigelow]], further north, each only extend a bit above {{convert|4000|ft|m}}, but have long alpine areas, with no tree growth on the summits and unobstructed views on clear days. From Mount Bigelow, the trail extends for {{convert|150|mi|km}} with only a small area of alpine growth around {{convert|3500|ft|m}} on the summit of [[White Cap Mountain (Piscataquis County, Maine)|White Cap Mountain]]. Mount Katahdin, the second largest alpine environment in the eastern United States, has several square miles of alpine area on the flat "table land" summit as well as the cliffs and [[ar<U+00EA>te|aretes]] leading up to it. Treeline on Mount Katahdin is only around {{convert|3500|ft|m}}. This elevation in Massachusetts would barely be a sub-alpine region, and, south of Virginia, consists of lowland forest. This illustrates the drastic change in climate over {{convert|2000|mi|km}}.

Despite the alpine environments well below {{convert|5000|ft|m}} in New Hampshire and Maine, some higher places further south are not alpine.  Examples include Wayah Bald in North Carolina {{convert|5342|ft|m}} and Clingman's Dome in [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] {{convert|6643|ft|m}}.

== Hiking the trail ==
As the Appalachian Trail was explicitly designed to be hiked, it includes resources to facilitate hikers. Some are common to trails throughout [[North America]], while some are unique to the Appalachian Trail. The trail is much more frequently hiked south to north (i.e. Georgia to Maine) than vice versa. Hikers typically begin in March or April and finish in late summer or early to late fall of that particular year.

=== Navigation ===
Throughout its length, the AT is marked by 2-by-6-inch (5-by-15-cm) white [[trail blazing|paint blazes]]. Side trails to shelters, viewpoints and parking areas use similarly shaped blue blazes.  In past years, some sections of the trail also used metal diamond markers with the AT logo, few of which survive.

</gallery></center>

=== Lodging and camping ===
The trail has more than 250 shelters and campsites available for hikers.<ref name=nickens>Nickens, T. Edward (July 2001), "Bed and Breakfast".'' Smithsonian''. '''32''' (4):24</ref> The shelters, sometimes called lean-tos (in Maine, Massachusetts, and Connecticut), huts (in Shenandoah National Park) or Adirondack shelters, are generally open, three-walled structures with a wooden floor, although some shelters are much more complex in structure. Shelters are usually spaced a day's hike or less apart, most often near a water source (which may be dry) and with a [[outhouse|privy]]. They generally have spaces for tent sites in the vicinity.<ref name=OFAQ/> the [[Appalachian Mountain Club]] (AMC) operated a [[High Huts of the White Mountains|system of eight huts]] along 56 miles of New Hampshire's White Mountains.<ref name=stroh>Stroh, Bess Zarafonitis (September/Octover 1998), "Colorful climbs". '' National Parks''. '''72''' (9/10):34-37</ref>  These huts are significantly larger than standard trail shelters and offer full-service lodging and meals during the summer months.  The Fontana Dam Shelter in Maine, is more commonly referred to as the Fontana Hilton because of amenities (eg. flush toilets) and its proximity to an all-you-can-eat buffet and post office.<ref name=nickens/> Several AMC huts have an extended self-service season during the fall, with two extending self-service season through the winter and spring.<ref>http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/whitemountains/huts/index.cfm</ref> The [[Potomac Appalachian Trail Club]] maintains trail cabins, shelters, and huts throughout the [[Shenandoah Valley AVA|Shenandoah region]] of Virginia.<ref name=stroh/>

Shelters are generally maintained by local volunteers. Almost all shelters have one or more pre-hung food hangers (generally consisting of a short nylon cord with an upside-down tuna can suspended halfway down its length) where hikers can hang their food bags to keep them out of the reach of rodents. In hiker lingo, these are sometimes called "mouse trapezes."<ref>Kimberly (2005). [http://www.adventurematters.com/infoglossary.htm "Glossary of Terms"] AdventureMatters.com (accessed September 12, 2006)</ref> 

In addition to official shelters, many people offer their homes, places of business, or inns to accommodate AT hikers. One example is the [[Little Lyford Pond camps]] maintained by the [[Appalachian Mountain Club]].  Inns are more common in sections of the trail that coincide with national parks, most notably Virginia's [[Shenandoah National Park]].<ref>[http://www.appalachiantrail.org/site/c.jkLXJ8MQKtH/b.789317/k.6033/Cabins_Huts_and_Hostels.htm "Cabins, Huts, and Hostels"] AppalachianTrail.org (accessed September 12, 2006)</ref>

=== Trail towns ===
[[Image:Boiling springs AT house.JPG|thumb|An information house in [[Boiling Springs, Pennsylvania]]]]
The trail crosses many roads, thus providing ample opportunity for hikers to [[hitchhike]] into town for food and other supplies. Many trail towns are accustomed to hikers passing through, and thus many have [[hotel]]s and hiker-oriented accommodations.<ref name=OFAQ/> Some of the most well-known trail towns are [[Hot Springs, North Carolina]], [[Erwin, Tennessee]], [[Damascus, Virginia]], [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]], [[Duncannon, Pennsylvania]], [[Port Clinton, Pennsylvania]], [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], and [[Monson, Maine]].  In the areas of the trail closer to trail towns, many hikers have experienced what is sometimes called "trail magic,"<ref>Melville, Greg (August 1999), "The Moocher". ''Sports Afield''. '''222''' (2):57</ref> or assistance from strangers through kind actions, gifts, and other forms of encouragement.<ref>Berger, Karen. [http://www.gorp.com/parks-guide/travel-ta-hiking-appalachian-trail-sidwcmdev_057849.html "Appalachian Trail: Trail Magic"] Gorp.com (accessed April 30, 2007)</ref>  Trail magic is sometimes done anonymously.<ref>[http://www.kodak.com/US/en/corp/features/appalachianTrail/history.shtml A.T. History] Kodak.com (accessed April 30, 2007)</ref>  In other instances, persons have provided food and cooked for hikers at a campsite.

=== Hazards ===
The Appalachian Trail is relatively safe. Most injuries or incidents are consistent with comparable outdoor activities. Most hazards are related to weather conditions, human error, plants, animals, diseases, and fellow humans encountered along the trail.<ref name=ATHS>[http://www.appalachiantrail.org/site/c.jkLXJ8MQKtH/b.794153/k.9D5E/Health_and_Safety.htm "Health and Safety"] AppalachianTrail.org (accessed September 15, 2006)</ref>

Many animals live around the trail, with bears, snakes, and [[wild boar]]s posing the greatest threat to human safety. Several rodent- and bug-borne illnesses are also a potential hazard. In scattered instances, [[fox|foxes]], [[raccoon|raccons]], and other small animals may bite hikers, posing risk of [[rabies]] and other diseases. There has been one reported case (in 1993) of [[hantavirus]] (HPS), a rare but dangerous rodent-borne disease affecting the lungs. The afflicted hiker recovered and hiked the trail the following year.<ref name=ATHS/>

Plant life can create its own brand of problems. [[Poison ivy]] is common the length of the trail, and more plentiful in the South.<ref name=OFAQ/>

Hiking season of the trail generally starts in mid to late spring, when conditions are much more favorable in the South. However, this time may also be characterized by extreme heat, sometimes in excess of {{convert|100|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|abbr=on}}. Under such conditions, hydration is imperative. Light clothing and sunscreens are a must at high elevations and areas without foliage, even in relatively cool weather.<ref name=ATHS/> 

Further north and at higher elevations, the weather can be intensely cold, characterized by low temperatures, strong winds, hail or snow storms and reduced visibility. Prolonged rain, though not typically life-threatening, can undermine stamina and ruin supplies.<ref name=ATW>[http://www.appalachiantrail.org/site/c.jkLXJ8MQKtH/b.1038315/k.C75E/Weather.htm "Weather"] AppalachianTrail.org (accessed September 14, 2006)</ref>

[[Violent crime]], including [[murder]], has occurred on the trail in a few instances. Most have been crimes by non-hikers who crossed paths relatively randomly with the AT hiker-victims.  The official website of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy points out that the number of violent crimes is extremely low when compared against the number of people (3 to 4 million) who hike on the trail every year.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.appalachiantrail.org/site/c.jkLXJ8MQKtH/b.851143 | accessdate=30 October 2008 | title=2,000-Milers: Facts and Statistics | publisher=[[Appalachian Trail Conservancy]]}}</ref>

=== Trail completion ===
[[Image:ANST-Triangle-Logo 1.jpg|frame|left]]Trail hikers who attempt to complete the entire trail in a single season are called "[[thru-hiker]]s"; those who traverse the trail during a series of separate trips are known as "section-hikers".  Rugged terrain, weather extremes, freedom from illness or injury, and the desire to commit the time and effort required make thru-hiking difficult to accomplish. 

Traditionally, only about 10% to 15% of those who make the attempt report to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy that they completed it.  However, since 2001, the number of people starting out in Georgia to do a thru-hike (or at least registering to do so) has dropped considerably, yet the number of people reporting that they have completed a thru-hike has remained approximately the same. This has resulted in an apparent increase in the completion rate to 29% (as of 2006). 

A thru-hike generally requires five to seven months, although some have done it in three months, and several trail runners have completed the trail in less time. [[Trail running|Trail runners]] typically tackle the AT with automobile support teams, without backpacks, and without camping in the woods.

The current unofficial speed record for through-hiking the AT was set by trail runner Andrew Thompson in 2005, at 47 days, 13 hours and 31 minutes. Thompson made the trip southbound, from late June to early August.<ref>{{cite news  |author= Jonathan Van Fleet |title= Hiker takes record in stride |url=http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050805/COLUMNISTS21/50805002/-1/opinion  | publisher = Nashua Telegraph |date= 2005-08-05 | accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref>

Thru-hikers are classified into many informal groups. "Purists" are hikers who stick to the official AT trail except for side trips to shelters and camp sites. "Blue Blazers" cut miles from the full route by taking side trails marked by blue blazes. The generally pejorative name "Yellow Blazers," a reference to yellow road stripes, is given to those who hitchhike to move down the trail. There are also those who hike the trail in sections known as "sectioners" as opposed to those who hike the whole trail as one course. 

Most thru-hikers walk northward from Georgia to Maine, and generally start out in early spring and follow the warm weather as it moves north.<ref name=OFAQ/> These "north-bounders" are also called NOBO (NOrthBOund) or GAME (Georgia(GA)-to-Maine(ME)), while those heading in the opposite direction are termed "south-bounders" (also SOBO or MEGA).<ref>{{cite web|title=Trail Terms and Slang|url=http://www.whiteblaze.net/forum/showthread.php?t=8115|accessdate=29 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=APPALACHIAN TRAIL - TERMS, DEFINITIONS AND LINGO|url=http://www.n2backpacking.com/long_trails/appalachian_trail/at_terms.htm|accessdate=29 August 2010}}</ref>

Part of hiker subculture includes making colorful entries in logbooks at trail shelters, signed using pseudonyms called [[pseudonym|trail names]].<ref name=applebome>APPLEBOME, PETER (May 31, 2010), "A Jolt of Energy for a Much Trod-Upon Trail". ''New York Times''. :14</ref>

The Appalachian Trail Conservancy gives the name "2000 Miler" to anyone who completes the entire trail. The ATC's recognition policy for "2000 Milers" gives equal recognition to thru-hikers and section-hikers, operates on the honor system, and recognizes blue-blazed trails or officially required roadwalks as substitutes for the official, white-blazed route during an emergency such as a flood, forest fire, or impending storm on an exposed, high-elevation stretch.<ref>[http://www.appalachiantrail.org/site/c.jkLXJ8MQKtH/b.848829/k.73F0/What_Happens_When_I_Finish.htm "What Happens When I Finish?"] AppalachianTrail.org (accessed September 11, 2006)</ref> As of 2010, more than 11,000 people had reported completing the entire trail.<ref name=FactsStats>[http://www.appalachiantrail.org/site/c.mqLTIYOwGlF/b.4805579/k.DA92/2000Milers_Facts_and_Statistics.htm 2,000-Miler Facts and Statistics], ATC website (accessed May 25, 2010)</ref> About three-quarters of these are thru-hikers.<ref name=FactsStats/>

<!--Any major expansion to this section should be done at the article Appalachian Trail by state -->
The trail is currently protected along more than 99% of its course by federal or state ownership of the land or by [[Easement|right-of-way]]. The trail is maintained by a variety of citizen organizations, environmental advocacy groups, governmental agencies and individuals.  Annually, more than 4,000 [[volunteer]]s contribute over 175,000 hours of effort on the Appalachian Trail, an effort coordinated largely by the [[Appalachian Trail Conservancy]] (ATC) organization. In total, the AT passes through eight national forests and two national parks.<ref name=nickens/>

In the course of its journey, the trail follows the ridgeline of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], crossing many of its highest peaks, and running, with only a few exceptions, almost continuously through [[wilderness]].  The trail used to traverse many hundreds of miles of private property; currently 99% of the trail is on public land.<ref name=public>[http://www.appalachiantrail.org/site/c.jkLXJ8MQKtH/b.786749/k.D5F9/History.htm "History"] AppalachianTrail.org (accessed June 24, 2008).</ref>

In some parts of the trail in Maine, even the strongest hikers may only average 1 mph. There are other parts in which hikers must hold on to tree limbs and roots to climb and descend, which are especially dangerous and hazardous in wet weather conditions.<ref>[http://www.appalachiantrail.org/site/c.mqLTIYOwGIF/b.4805423/k.5EDO/Explore_the_Trail_Maine.htm "Explore the Trail: Maine] AppalachianTrail.org(accessed August 11, 2010).</ref>

The western section includes a mile-long (1.6&nbsp;km) stretch of boulders at [[Mahoosuc Notch]], often called the trail's hardest mile. Also, although there are dozens of river and stream fords on the Maine section of the trail, the [[Kennebec River]] is the only one on the trail that requires a boat crossing. The most isolated portion in the state (and arguably on the entire trail) is known as the "[[Hundred-Mile Wilderness]]", which heads east-northeast from the town of [[Monson, Maine|Monson]] and ends outside [[Baxter State Park]] just south of Abol Bridge.<ref name=maine>[http://www.appalachiantrail.org/hike/trail/maine.html "Explore the Trail: Maine"]  AppalachianTrail.org (accessed September 11, 2006).</ref>

==Research==
The Appalachian Trail has been a resource for researchers in a variety of disciplines.  Portions of the trail in Tennessee were used on a study on trail maintence for the Trail's "uniform environmental
conditions and design attributes and substantial gradient in visitor use."<ref name=marion/>  Beginning in 2007, various citizen groups, including the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and the [[American Hiking Society]], began a study to monitor environmental changes that have resulted from [[Ozone#Ozone as a greenhouse gas|higher ozone levels]], [[acid rain]], [[smog]], and other air quality factors.<ref name=winter> (Winter 2007), "TRAIL WITH A TALE TO TELL".'' American Forests''. '''112''' (4):17</ref>  Such research has been supported by the National Park Service, [[U.S. Forest Service]], [[Cornell University]], the [[National Geographic Society]], and [[Aveda Corporation]].<ref name=winter/>

Behavioral studies have also been conducted on hikers themselves.  A 2007 study on hikers found that most persons hike the trail "for fun and enjoyment of life and for warm relationships with others" and that "that environmental awareness, physical challenge, camaraderie, exercise, and solitude" were chief results among hikers.<ref>Goldenberg, Marni; Hill, Eddie; Freidt, Barbara (2008), "Why Individuals Hike the Appalachian Trail: A Qualitative Approach to Benefits."'' Journal of Experiential Education''. '''30''' (3):277-281</ref>  Since the highest single demographic of thru-hikers are males between the ages of 18-29, one informal study sought to find the correlation between this group and male college drop-outs.<ref>Arnold, Karen D. (November/December 2007), "Education on the appalachian trail: What 2,000 miles can teach us about learning".'' About Campus''., '''12''' (5):2-9</ref>

==Notes==
{{cnote|a|The exact length of the Appalachian Trail is not known, as periodic changes and maintenance to the trail alters the trail's length, making an exact figure difficult to ascertain. (See [http://www.outdoors.org/conservation/trails/at/at-faq.cfm Outdoors.org])}}
