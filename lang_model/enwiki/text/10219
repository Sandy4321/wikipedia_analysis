{{distinguish|Jillian Lewis}}

'''Gillian Lewis''' was an [[England|English]] character actress who, after a varied stage career in the 1950s and early '60s, appeared in a number of television drama series until the late 1970s. Her best known roles were probably as the runaway [[Beneficiary|heiress]] Geraldine Melford in the original London production of [[Julian Slade|Slade]] and [[Dorothy Reynolds|Reynolds]]' musical ''[[Free as Air]]'' and, on television, as Drusilla Lamb, secretary to [[The Odd Man|Mr. Rose]] in the detective series of that name.

==Early stage career==
Gillian Lewis was born in [[Tisbury, Wiltshire|Tisbury]], [[Wiltshire]].<ref>Biographical note in Theatre Royal, Brighton programme for ''Difference of Opinion'' (January 1965)</ref> She trained at the [[Bristol Old Vic]] Theatre School and then worked with the company, combining minor acting parts with the job of assistant stage manager. In 1953 she had a supporting role (Cousin Rosie) in Julian Slade and Dorothy Reynolds<U+2019> [[Christmas]] musical ''The Merry Gentleman'' at the [[Theatre Royal, Bristol|Theatre Royal]], [[Bristol]]<ref>[http://www.musical-theatre.net/html/unsungheroines/gillianlewis.html]; ''Independent'' obituary of Julian Slade, 23 June 2006. Slade was musical director of the Bristol Old Vic company.</ref> and the following year worked backstage at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] in London when Slade and Reynolds' ''[[Salad Days (musical)|Salad Days]]''<ref>Theatre Royal programme for ''Difference of Opinion'', ''loc.cit.''</ref> transferred there from Bristol.<ref>''Oxford Companion to Popular Music'' (1991)</ref>

While working with the [[Ipswich]] [[Repertory]] Company, she met her future husband, the actor Peter Beton.

===''Free as Air'' (1957)===
In 1957, after Slade and Reynolds had enjoyed considerable acclaim with ''Salad Days'', Lewis and [[Patricia Bredin]] (who in the same year was the [[United Kingdom]]<U+2019>s first ever entrant to the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]) took the main female roles in their follow-up show, ''Free as Air'', which opened at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in [[London]] on 6 June 1957 following an initial season in [[Manchester]]. Although this and other Slade musicals never quite matched the success of ''Salad Days'',<ref>See, for example, ''Oxford Companion to Popular Music'' (1991)</ref> ''Free as Air'', which was set on the fictional [[Channel Islands|Channel Island]] of Terhou,<ref>Based on [[Jethou]]</ref> ran for 417 performances, some critics regarding it as more slick and professional than its predecessor.<ref>''Independent'' obituary of Julian Slade, ''loc.cit.''. Rexton S. Bunnett, an avid collector of memorabilia of musical theatre, described ''Free as Air'' as "a true book musical" rather than (like ''Salad Days'') "a flimsy, revue like show": sleeve notes to 2007 CD release of ''Free as Air'' (Sepia 1102). At the very least, ''Salad Days'' "didn't rely on any [[Broadway musical|Broadway]] model of musical, seeming rather to represent a vigorous counter-attack on the form": ''The Musicals Collection'' - 18: ''Salad Days'' (Orbis, 1994)</ref> A cast recording, which includes Lewis singing a solo number, "Nothing But Sea and Sky", duets with John Trevor ("Free as Air" and "I<U+2019>d Like to Be Like You") and in a trio with [[Josephine Tewson]] and [[Gerald Harper]] ("Holiday Island"), was released on [[compact disc]] in 2007.<ref>Sepia CD 1102 (2007)</ref> One admirer has written that her "sometimes uncertain [[soprano]] voice" was "tenuous but perched on the edge of beauty".<ref>[http://www.musical-theatre.net/html/unsungheroines/gillianlewis.html]</ref> Like Lewis, both Harper and Tewson moved successfully into television in the 1960s.<ref>Gerald Harper achieved fame as [[Adam Adamant]] and [[Hadleigh (TV series)|James Hadleigh]]. Josephine Tewson<U+2019>s best known role came in the 1990s as [[Hyacinth Bucket]]<U+2019>s neighbour Elizabeth in the situation comedy ''[[Keeping Up Appearances]]''. [[Leonard Rossiter]], remembered for his TV roles as [[Rising Damp|Rupert Rigsby]] and [[Reginald Perrin]], was also in the original production of ''Free as Air''. In 1967 Lewis and [[Pauline Yates]], who later played Rossiter's wife, Elizabeth Perrin, appeared together in an episode of ''Mr. Rose'' ("The Honest Villain").</ref> Peter Beton also appeared in ''Free as Air''.<ref>Theatre Royal programme for ''Difference of Opinion'', ''loc.cit.''</ref>

===Other roles===
In the early 1960s Lewis played extensively in repertory theatre in Bristol, appearing in, among many other productions, revivals of [[John Dighton]]<U+2019>s ''[[The Happiest Days of Your Life]]'' (1960) (based on his screenplay for the 1949 film starring [[Alastair Sim]] and [[Margaret Rutherford]]), [[No<U+00EB>l Coward]]<U+2019>s ''[[Private Lives]]'' (1960) and ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'' (1961)<ref>[http://theatricalia.com/person/vd8/gillian-lewis]</ref> and [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[An Ideal Husband]]'' (1960).<ref>Theatre Royal programme for ''Difference of Opinion'', ''loc.cit.''</ref> In 1962 she played the flirtatious Natalia Snevellicci in the Bristol premi<U+00E8>re of ''Step into the Limelight'', a musical by Edgar K. Bruce and Betty Lawrence based on the Crummles theatrical troupe in [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]''. In 2004 a compact disc was released of "[[Demo (music)|demo]]" recordings made at the time by members of the cast, with Lawrence on piano, together with ones cut in 1969 when the show was revived in Bristol with a new cast that included Josephine Gordon and Elric Cooper.<ref>[http://www.must-close-saturday-records.co.uk/html/pages/step.html Must Close Saturday CD MCSR 3014]</ref>

Lewis appeared also at other provincial theatres: for example, with [[Robert Beatty]], [[Kynaston Reeves]] and [[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]] in George Ross and [[Campbell Singer]]'s ''Difference of Opinion'' at the [[Theatre Royal, Brighton|Theatre Royal]], [[Brighton]] in 1965.<ref>Theatre Royal programme, ''loc.cit.'', for production beginning on 25 January 1965. Lewis and [[Campbell Singer]], who was a well-known actor on television, both appeared in an episode of ''Mr. Rose'', "The Black Beast", in March 1967.</ref> She returned to the [[West End of London|West End]] in 1963 for the London premi<U+00E8>re of [[Leonard Bernstein]]<U+2019>s ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]]'' at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]]. In a short run,<ref>The production opened on 30 May 1963 and ran for 63 performances.</ref> Lewis took the feisty role of Claire (the part played by [[Ann Miller]] in the [[On the Town (film)|1949 film]] and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] by the show's librettist [[Betty Comden]]) alongside two American actresses, Andrea Jaffe and [[Carol Arthur]].<ref>Ethan Mordden, notes for 1993 Deutsche Grammophon CD 437 516-2</ref>

One view of Lewis's stage persona in the late '50s and early '60s is that she, [[Susan Hampshire]] and [[Anna Dawson]], who all had leading roles in Slade musicals, "possessed an extraordinary Englishness of feature and bearing and voice that seems absolutely to have vanished from the theatre, perhaps from the world itself".<ref>"Icarus" at [http://www.musical-theatre.net/html/followthatgirl/follow4.html]. Susan Hampshire starred in ''[[Follow That Girl]]'' and Anna Dawson in ''Wildest Dreams'' (both 1960). Both subsequently achieved fame on television, Hampshire notably as Fleur in the BBC's adaptation of [[John Galsworthy]]'s ''[[The Forsyte Saga (1967 series)|Forsyte Saga]]'' (1967).</ref>

==Television in the mid-1960s==
In the mid '60s Gillian Lewis appeared in episodes of such popular television series as ''[[Gideon's Way]]'' (1964), ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' (1965), ''[[The Troubleshooters|Mogul]]'' (1965), ''[[Public Eye (TV series)|Public Eye]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Baron]]'' (1966).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0507228/ Gillian Lewis IMDb]</ref> A number of her roles, then and later, were in series that subsequently acquired [[cult following|"cult"]] status among devotees.

In the ''Avengers'' episode, "The Man-Eater of Surrey Green" (broadcast December 1965), she played Laura Burford, an old friend of [[Emma Peel]] ([[Diana Rigg]]) who was mysteriously lured away from scientific work alongside her tactile fianc<U+00E9> to a [[horticulture|horticultural]] project aimed at propagating menacing [[runner bean|bean]]-like plants with gigantic [[tendril]]s. As Joyce Grant in ''The Baron'' ("So Dark the Night", broadcast 15 March 1967), her father died in a spooky country house just before the series' [[eponymous]] hero ([[Steve Forrest (actor)|Steve Forrest]] as John Mannering) and his glamorous assistant ([[Sue Lloyd]] as Cordelia Winfield) arrived to value some antiques. This was the prelude to <U+201C>an eerie web of intrigue, murder and revenge, with two girls facing hair-raising danger<U+201D>.<ref>Notes to Network DVD, ''The Baron'' (2005), page 13</ref> Such parts were fairly typical of those available to young women making guest appearances in adventure series of the time.

==''Mr. Rose'' (1967)==
In the influential<ref>Philip Purser in Leslie Halliwell's ''Television Companion'' (8th ed., 1984)</ref> ''Mr. Rose'' ([[Granada Television|Granada]], 1967), starring [[William Mervyn]] as Charles Rose, an acerbic retired [[Scotland Yard]] detective,<ref>See, for example, Hallilwell, ''supra''; notes to ''Mr. Rose'': complete first series (Network DVD, 2012). Mervyn, who was probably best known for his role as the Bishop of St. Ogg's in ''[[All Gas and Gaiters]]'', first appeared as Chief Inspector Rose in ''[[The Odd Man]]'' (1962).</ref> Lewis played his live-in secretary, Miss Drusilla Lamb. Drusilla was employed ostensibly to help Rose with his [[autobiography|memoirs]], although work on these was repeatedly delayed by his getting involved in unofficial investigative work.<ref>In his use of "influential" to describe ''Mr. Rose'', Purser (Halliwell, ''supra'') went so far as to draw a comparison with the American series ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', which began in 1967 with [[Raymond Burr]] as a former [[San Francisco]] police chief assisted by three young officers, including [[Barbara Anderson (actress)|Barbara Anderson]] as the fashionable and well-heeled Eve Whitfield. A year earlier, in the BBC's ''[[Adam Adamant Lives!]]'', [[Gerald Harper]] as Adamant had, like Rose, a young female assistant ([[Juliet Harmer]] as [[Georgina Jones]]) and a manservant ([[Jack May]]). Though set thirty or so years earlier, the most similar role on British television to that of Drusilla Lamb was probably that of Miss Lemon ([[Pauline Moran]]) in the adaptations of [[Agatha Christie]]'s [[Poirot (TV series)|Poirot]] novels starring [[David Suchet]] (LWT/ITV, 1989-).</ref>

===Lewis as Drusilla Lamb===
Over a series of 13 episodes produced and mostly written by [[Philip Mackie]], Lewis portrayed Drusilla as a highly professional and, at first, rather prim, proper and somewhat icy<ref>In the first episode, "The Bright Bomber", Donald Webster as John Halifax refers to Drusilla (to her face) as "frigid" (a word with overtones of sexual unresponsiveness), but quickly apologises and changes his description to "icy".</ref> assistant who had been through [[finishing school]], had a [[shorthand]] speed of 150 words per minute,<ref>Episode, "The Noble Roman", broadcast 3 March 1967</ref> but was unable (so she always said) to make decent [[coffee]].<ref>Although Drusilla was required to cook infrequently, it transpired that she had achieved only "highly commended" for her domestic science at finishing school: episode, "The Honest Villain", 14 April 1967.</ref> However, despite her apparent hauteur, she was also beautiful,<ref>Sleeve notes, 2012 DVD ''(loc.cit.)''</ref> attracting ready attention from men to whom Rose introduced her, and, in the first episode (broadcast 17 February 1967), her potential [[Sexual attraction|sexiness]] was hinted at by an unexpected scene in which Rose<U+2019>s manservant (Donald Webster as John Halifax) burst into her bedroom as she was about to put on a [[sweater|jumper]] over her [[brassiere|bra]] and [[panties]].<ref>"The Bright Bomber", ''loc.cit''. Halifax's intentions were perfectly honourable: Rose had just told him about Drusilla's proximity to a bomb explosion and he was concerned for her welfare.</ref> Despite Drusilla's momentary loss of composure, she appeared largely unfazed by this intrusion, as also by other early incidents, such as a bomb explosion at Rose's front door and (a few years before "[[women's lib]]" began to take hold) Rose's pinching her [[buttocks]], apparently to demonstrate that he alone was capable of shocking her. Her generally worldly and practical outlook was further corroborated by her calm demeanour at a boisterous riverboat party that culminated in a provocative [[striptease]] by a blonde [[teenager]] ([[Judy Geeson]]) who had been hired to compromise Rose.<ref>Episode, "The Tin God", broadcast 31 March 1967. In the event, Rose outwitted his protagonists.</ref> Even so, Rose thought Drusilla bossy<ref>Episode, "The One Woman", broadcast 5 May 1967</ref> and "refused to be nagged" by her on Sunday afternoon.<ref>Episode, "The Good Loser", broadcast 12 May 1967</ref> She could also be quite spirited, even blunt and wilful: she was angrily defiant when held prisoner after being kidnapped,<ref>Episode, "The Avenging Angel", 28 April 1967</ref> while, during a minor domestic encounter, Rose seemed amused by her telling him to "damn well do" something himself because she thought she was being treated unreasonably.<ref>Episode, "The Honest Villain", broadcast 14 April 1967</ref>

An enticing contrast with Drusilla's initial [[twinset]] image<ref>A later description of Lewis herself was of a "[[Home Counties]] heroine [who] seemed most at home in twin set and pearls",[http://www.musical-theatre.net/html/followthatgirl/follow4.html] although, as noted, she came from [[Wiltshire]], rather than the [[South East England|south-east]], and cut her theatrical teeth in Bristol. In addition, her roles on television were diverse. In "The Tin God", Rose gave Drusilla a set of pearls for her birthday, while Halifax bought her a fashionable shift dress that she herself said she would not have dared to buy on her own.</ref> was provided by a working [[Cruising (maritime)|cruise]] to [[South Africa]] on which she enjoyed a romance with a suave ex-jewel thief and Halifax teased her that she was displaying too much of her [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]] while relaxing on deck.<ref>Episode, "The Jolly Swagman", broadcast 17 March 1967</ref> It eventually came to light that in fact her background was not as straight forward as it had seemed: specifically, she had been encouraged to apply for the job with Rose by an ex-army [[confidence trick]]ster whom she believed to be her father. His unwelcome re-appearance in Drusilla's life following release from a seven-year prison sentence led both Rose, who he tried to blackmail, and Halifax, who began to emit some tender feelings for his female colleague, to take stock of their relationship with her, but then actively to stand by her.<ref>Episode, "The Bad Halfpenny", broadcast 7 April 1967, in which Drusilla also confirmed that her mother, whose surname she used, had died when she was 17.</ref> In the final episode of the series, Drusilla told Rose that she had "no private life", although it became reasonably clear that she reciprocated Halifax's apparent fondness for her.<ref>"The Good Loser", ''loc.cit.''</ref>

The first series of ''Mr. Rose'' was released on [[DVD]] by Network in 2012. Lewis did not return for the second series (1968) in which [[Jennifer Clulow]] played Drusilla's successor, Jessica Dalton. In the first episode of that series,<ref>"The Frozen Swede'', broadcast 30 May 1968</ref> Rose recalled to Halifax that he had given Drusilla away at her wedding.

==Later TV roles==
Lewis appeared in a number of later series, including ''[[Department S (TV series)|Department S]]'', starring [[Peter Wyngarde]] as Jason King (1969), the ground-breaking [[science fiction]] drama ''[[Doomwatch]]'' (1970), ''[[The Mind of Mr. J. G. Reeder]]'' (as Margaret Belman, a role she took over from [[Virginia Stride]], in several episodes based on stories by [[Edgar Wallace]], 1971), ''Crown Court'' (1972), ''[[The Duchess of Duke Street]]'' (1976) and ''[[The Mallens]]'', adapted from the novels of [[Catherine Cookson]] (nine episodes as Jane Radlet, 1979<U+2013>80).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0507228/ Gillian Lewis IMDb]</ref>

==Films==
Among Lewis<U+2019>s film credits were ''Ring of Treason'' (1964), based on the events surrounding the [[Portland spy ring]] of the early 1960s; [[Galton and Simpson]]<U+2019>s [[satire|satirical spoof]] ''[[The Spy with a Cold Nose]]'' (1966) in a cast that included [[Laurence Harvey]], [[Lionel Jeffries]], [[Eric Sykes]] and [[June Whitfield]]; and ''Belgrove Hotel, Goodbye'' (1970).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0507228/ ''Halliwell's Film Guide'' (7th ed, 1989); Gillian Lewis IMDb]</ref> She also made an uncredited appearance as a television announcer in ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1966).

Film historian [[Leslie Halliwell]] dismissed ''The Spy with a Cold Nose'' as a "rather painful, overacted and overwritten farce full of obvious jokes masquerading as satire".<ref>''Halliwell's Film Guide'', 7th ed (1989)</ref> The essence of Lewis's role as Lady Warburton was captured in the opening sentence of Galton and Simpson's 1967 novel based on their screenplay: "To the eyes of her beholders, the beauty of Sandra, Lady Warburton, lay in strict ratio to the importance they attached to her bank balance".<ref>Ray Galton & Alan Simpson, ''The Spy with a Cold Nose'' (Arrow Books, 1967)</ref>
