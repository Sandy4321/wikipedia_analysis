'''Steve James Grogan''' ([[July 24]], [[1953]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]]) was an [[American football]]  [[quarterback]] for the [[New England Patriots]] in the [[National Football League]] from [[1975 New England Patriots season|1975]] until [[1990 New England Patriots season|1990]].  

==College career==
After a standout prep career at Ottawa High School where he led his team to state titles in basketball and track and a state runner-up finish in football, Grogan spent his collegiate career at [[Kansas State University]]. At Kansas State, he passed for 2,213 yards and ran for 585 yards to rank among the school's all-time passing and total offense leaders.  

==Pro career==
Grogan was picked in the fifth round (116th overall) in the [[1975 NFL Draft]]. Sitting behind team star quarterback and former [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Jim Plunkett]], head coach [[Chuck Fairbanks]] replaced Plunkett with Grogan in mid-season. Grogan threw for 1,976 yards, 11 touchdowns and 18 interceptions. Eventually, New England traded Plunkett to the 49ers for two first round draft picks; one in 1976, and one in 1977 along with the [[San Francisco 49ers]]' second Round pick in the [[1977 NFL Draft]].

In [[1976 New England Patriots season|1976]], Grogan led the Patriots to an 11-3 record and a playoff berth after the team had finished only 3-11 the previous year. During that season, the Patriots defeated the defending [[Super Bowl]] champion, [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], as well as the [[Oakland Raiders]], who would go on to win [[Super Bowl XI]]. Although the 1976 was not statistically one of Grogan's best, his 12 rushing touchdowns during the 1976 season still stand as the most rushing touchdowns in a season by quarterback. <ref>[http://www.footballdb.com/stats.html?yr=1976&lg=NFL&conf=&mode=R&sort=rushtds]</ref>.

In [[1978 New England Patriots season|1978]], Grogan led the Pats to a 11-5 record, and the organization's first ever home playoff game, a 31-14 loss to the [[Houston Oilers]]. The Pats set the single season team rushing record with 3,156 yards (Grogan rushing for 539 yards and 5 touchdowns himself).

Statistically, Grogan's best season was in [[1979 New England Patriots season|1979]], when he completed 206 of 423 passes for 3,286 yards and 28 touchdowns <ref>[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/GrogSt00.htm]</ref>. 

In [[1985 New England Patriots season|1985]], [[Tony Eason]] led the Patriots to a 2-3 record out of the gate, and coach [[Raymond Berry]] decide to benched Eason for Grogan in hopes of igniting the offense. The Patriots rallied to 6 straight wins behind their old quarterback, only to lose Grogan when he suffered a broken leg in Week 11 against the New York Jets. Filling in again at QB, Eason and the Patriots lost that Jets game 16-13 in overtime, and relinquished 1st place in the AFC East Division. With Easons' return, the Patriots went 3-2 in their remaining five games. Finishing the season with an 11-5 record, the Patriots earned a wild card berth into the playoffs and eventually reached [[Super Bowl XX]]. Against the [[Chicago Bears]], Grogan was medically cleared to play on the eve of the Super Bowl and replaced Eason in the second quarter after Eason completed zero passes in six attempts. Grogan went on to connect on 17 of 30 passes for 177 yards and a touchdown in the 46-10 loss.  

After Eason was released later in the decade, Grogan led the team in passing yards in [[1987 New England Patriots season|1987]] and [[1989 New England Patriots season|1989]] before retiring at the conclusion of the [[1990 New England Patriots season|1990]] season.

At the time of his retirment, Grogan lead the franchise as the all time leader in passing yards (26,886) and passing toudowns (182). He is still 2nd in those categories behind [[Drew Bledsoe]].  His 16 seasons are the most ever for a Patriots player.  He also held the Patriots previous single-game record with a 153.9 [[quarterback rating]], achieved by completing 13-of-18 passes for 315 yards with five touchdowns and no interceptions versus the [[New York Jets]] in 1979, before [[Tom Brady]] posted a [[NFL quarterbacks who have posted a perfect passer rating|158.3]] rating against the Miami Dolphins on October 21, 2007.

Grogan rushed for 2,164 yards (4.9 per carry) and 35 touchdowns during his career, a mark which places him as the Patriots' third overall in rushing touchdowns. Those touchdowns also place Grogan tied with [[Randall Cunningham]] and [[Tobin Rote]] in fourth place all-time among NFL quarterbacks in rushing scores.

During his pro career, Grogan led the Patriots to the playoffs four times (1976, 1978, 1982, and 1985)- as well as in (1986) as a backup.

==Honors==
Grogan's high school, Ottawa High School in [[Ottawa, Kansas]] has named its football stadium after him.

Kansas State has retired the number Grogan wore for the Wildcats, #11, to jointly honor him and his predecessor, [[Lynn Dickey]].  It is the only number retired by Kansas State.  He wore #14 with the Patriots.

Grogan is a member of the Patriots Hall of Fame and was named to the Patriots 35th Anniversary Team in 1994.
