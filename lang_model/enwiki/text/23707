[[Image:Kenya Dialect map.jpg|thumb|Kenya is a country of great ethnic and linguistic diversity. Most Kenyans are bilingual in English and [[Swahili]], also a big percentage speak their mother tongue of their ethnic tribe. Onyango speaks [[Dholuo language|Dholuo]].]]

In 2002 Onyango applied for [[political asylum]] in the United States citing violence in Kenya; a federal immigration judge eventually rejected the request and instructed her to leave the country.<ref> [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/us/politics/02campaign.html?em ''Obama Was Unaware of Aunt<U+2019>s Status, Aides Say'']</ref><ref name="DAOAMHBFL"> [http://www.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/20081103/BREAKING01/81103078/-1/LOCALNEWSFRONT ''Disclosure about Obama's aunt may have broken federal law'']</ref> Joan Friedland, a lawyer and immigration policy director at the [[National Immigration Law Center]] in Washington noted that even though an immigration judge makes a decision other options exist for a claimant.<ref name="BHATHFH"/> Onyango, and the Obama family are members of the [[Luo (Kenya and Tanzania)|Luo tribe]], Kenya's third-largest (12%) ethnic group.<ref>Gaston, Bruno, [http://reddingnewsreview.com/newspages/2008newspages/nilotic_link_places_obama_08_091000196.htm 'Nilotic' Link Places Obama's Roots in Southern Sudan], Redding News Review, Atlanta, Sept. 3, 2008</ref><ref name="ILTSBAF"> [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article5092967.ece ''I learned to slip back and forth between my black and white worlds'']</ref><ref> [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96670528 ''In Kenya, Obama Win Sparks Celebration'']</ref> Kenya has seen "longtime ethnic tension between the Luo and Kikuyu"; the [[Kikuyu]] are the most populous tribe accounting for approximately 22% of the the country's people.<ref>CIA Factbook [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ke.html#People] retrieved on [[October 16]] [[2007]]</ref><ref name="TDFZO"/> Tensions between the Luo and the Kikuyu can be traced to the mid-1960s post-independence period when a bitter falling out between the president (a Kikuyu) and his Vice President [[Jaramogi Oginga Odinga|Jaramogi Odinga]] (a Luo) resulted in a "sustained political persecution of the Luo" who remain one of Kenya's most marginalised groups.<ref> [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/why-kenyas-pride-in-obama-victory-is-tempered-994355.html ''Why Kenya's pride in Obama victory is tempered'']</ref> Kenya's current prime minister and [[Orange Democratic Movement|former opposition leader]], [[Raila Odinga]], is also Luo tribe, he is Jaramogi Odinga's son and has claimed to be related to the Obamas.<ref name="Obama">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7176683.stm Odinga says Obama is his cousin], [[BBC News]], 1/8/08.</ref><ref name="Said Obama">[http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL08727241.html Some Kenyans forget crisis to root for Obama], [[Reuters]], 1/8/08.</ref> Odinga serves as [[Prime Minister of Kenya]] with president [[Mwai Kibaki]] (a Kikuyu) in a [[coalition government]].

==Immigration status==
{{legal status}}
Onyango became the subject of widespread and international media attention in the final week of the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]] in which Obama was the Democratic candidate. The impetus for the scrutiny was an article by the [[Associated Press]], based on anonymous government sources, which reported that Onyango was living in the United States without valid [[Status (law)|immigration status]], after being asked by a immigration judge to leave the country.<ref name="AP">Associated Press [http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iVVj5SjAgqpjIbqdmcOB74FtqRIAD945TB601 AP: Obama aunt from Kenya living in US illegally]</ref><ref>[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/O/OBAMA_AUNT?SITE=NYPLA&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT Obama says he didn't know aunt's illegal status]</ref>  Although such an order from a judge can be appealed, it is not known if Onyango did appeal the order<ref name="DisclosureWP"/> Several news organizations described Onyango as an [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrant]].<ref> [http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/sundaypapers,1581,obamas-immigrant-aunt-exposed,53136 Obama<U+2019>s immigrant aunt exposed]</ref><ref> [http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1082291/Obamas-presidential-campaign-rocked-revelation-aunt-illegal-immigrant-U-S.html Obama's presidential campaign rocked by revelation his aunt is an illegal immigrant in the U.S.]</ref> although she was issued a Social Security card in 2001 indicating she was legally present and authorized to work at that time.<ref name="DisclosureWP">
[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/01/AR2008110102187_pf.html Disclosure About Obama's Aunt May Have Violated Privacy Policy]</ref>

Onyango's case resulted in a special nationwide directive within [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) requiring any deportations to be approved at the level of ICE regional directors before the U.S presidential election.<ref name="AP" /> In discussing Onyango's case, various media outlets have discussed some of the issues of immigrants including [[political asylum]] cases. [[MSNBC]]'s Domenico Montanaro noted that thousands of people live for years in the US after receiving [[deportation]] orders.<ref name="ice ice babay"> [http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/11/02/1626632.aspx ''OBAMA: ICE, ICE, BABY'']</ref> "Fugitive apprehension teams usually target suspects with criminal records before they go after simple immigration violators".<ref name="ice ice babay"/> Of an estimated ten million illegal immigrants, the [[Washington Post]] noted that an estimated 550,000 persons that have been denied [[asylum]] continue to reside in the United States.<ref> [http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24590999-663,00.html ''Family storm aside, Barack Obama feels wind of change'']</ref><ref> [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/01/AR2008110102187.html?nav=hcmodule ''Disclosure About Obama's Aunt May Have Violated Privacy Policy'']</ref>

===2008 presidential campaign ===
Onyango contributed a small sum of money to [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|Obama's 2008 presidential campaign]] but as it is illegal for foreign citizens and immigrants without [[green cards]] to make political donations, the campaign stated they would return the donations regardless of her status to avoid any appearance of wrongdoing.<ref name="MSNBC"> [http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/10/31/1620851.aspx First read, MSNBC]</ref><ref name="Unaware">{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/us/politics/02campaign.html?ref=politics | title=Obama Unaware of Status of Aunt, Campaign Says | author=Gardiner Harris | work=[[The New York Times]] | publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] | date=2008-11-01 | accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref> One of the six commissioners of the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC), Ellen Weintraub, stated she was unsure if the agency - charged with administering and enforcing finance statutes that govern the election - had any mechanism to prevent contributions from foreign nationals.<ref name="FECCDK"> [http://www.cnsnews.com/public/content/article.aspx?RsrcID=38699 ''FEC Commissioner <U+2018>Doesn<U+2019>t Know<U+2019> If Analysts Can Catch Foreign Contributions'']</ref> Weintraub stated donors are not required to furnish the FEC with Social Security Numbers and the two major parties have large opposition research departments to look for irregularities including "foreign-sounding names".<ref name="FECCDK"/>

The Obama campaign and commentators noted the suspect timing of the leaked information so close to the election.<ref name="OAITUSI"/><ref name="OFWMBIA"> [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/02/us-elections-2008-barack-obama1 ''Obama's final weekend marred by 'illegal' aunt'']</ref> [[Illegal immigration]] is considered a hot-button issue in US politics - "particularly among white, working-class voters" - immigrants are often accused of taking jobs and government services from US citizens.<ref name="OAITUSI"/><ref name="OFWMBIA"/>

This is the second time in the last month of the campaign that a law enforcement official has leaked privileged information to the [[Associated Press]] that could affect the election.<ref name="TDFZO"> [http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=11&year=2008&base_name=the_danger_facing_zeituni_onya ''THE DANGER FACING ZEITUNI ONYANGO.'']</ref> The first incident was the [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now#ACORN in political discourse|alleged FBI investigation of ACORN]].<ref> [http://www.pubrecord.org/law/449.html?task=view ''DOJ's Internal Watchdogs Probing Leak of ACORN Investigation'']</ref>

===Legality regarding release of information===
The ''[[Washington Post]]'' noted federal [[privacy laws of the United States|privacy law]] restricts [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) from disclosing information about citizens and permanent residents, and DHS policy limits disclosures about immigrant's status.<ref name="DAOAMHVPP"> [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/01/AR2008110102187.html?hpid=topnews ''Disclosure About Obama's Aunt May Have Violated Privacy Policy'']</ref> [[Asylum]]-seekers are granted greater protection from release of information to the public, because of the sensitive nature of their claims and the risks of retaliation.<ref name="DAOAMHVPP"/> In a statement, a spokeswoman for [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) said the matter has been referred to the agency's [[Office of Professional Responsibility]] and its parent department's inspector general.<ref name="DAOAMHVPP"/> "They are looking into whether there was a violation of policy in publicly disclosing individual case information," ICE spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. "We can't comment on individual cases."<ref name="DisclosureWP"/>
