==History==
[[File:Crusader cavalry.jpg|right|thumb|Legend has it that the Dimiat vine was brought to Thrace by Christian Crusaders returning from the Nile Delta.]]
The exact origins of the Dimiat grape are unknown, with some ampelographers believing the vine to be native to the Bulgaria area. One alternative theory is the legendary tale that the grape was native to the Nile Delta valley (where today there is a Egyptian town with a similar name, [[Damietta]]) and was brought back to [[Thrace]] by Christian Crusader.<ref name="Clarke pg 85"/> It is likely that the grape [[crossed (plant)|crossed]] with [[Riesling]] to produce the pink-skinned [[Misket Varnenski]] grape variety.<ref name="Oxford pg 228"> J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 228 Oxford University Press 2006 ISBN 0198609906 </ref>
