Aspects of [[love]] ([[Spanish language|amor]]), [[lust]] ([[Russian language|<U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+0430><U+0441><U+0442><U+044C>]]), [[faith]] ([[Simplified Chinese characters|<U+4FE1><U+5FF5>]]), and [[dream]]s ([[French language|R<U+00CA>VES]]) are shown throughout the video.

The video focuses on a type of wine, in which is a large space where the actions occur. Throughout the plot appears [[lion]] a [[snake]], various [[zebra]] and [[wolf]]. Each frame is like a photograph, and yet, they are all intrinsically linked, so that when combined, these unique images form a cohesive force unit. They tell a story to convey emotions of lust, loss, sadness, desire and anger. Note that in the scenes displayed the album [[Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams]], and also the cover of the single from "Up In the Air", a zebra in front of a blue wall.

The video was nominated for Best video at Kerrang! Awards 2013.
