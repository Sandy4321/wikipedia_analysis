'''Inferno''' is the name of several [[fictional characters]] from the various [[Transformers universes]]. Despite having different alternate modes, the character name has been most associated with the form of a [[Fire apparatus#Fire engine|fire engine]].

Inferno is a fearless Autobot who has a firetruck as his vehicle form.<ref>{{Cite book | title=The Unofficial Guide to Transformers 1980s Through 1990s Revised & Expanded 2nd Edition | last=Alvarez | first=J.E. | year=2001 | publisher=Schiffer Publishing Ltd.| ISBN=0-7643-1364-9 | page= 27}}</ref> Inferno enjoys receiving attention when saving lives and extinguishing fires, however is easily distracted, getting involved in combat preferring the heat of battle to the heat of a burning building.

===Marvel Comics===
Inferno appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]] Transformers comic. In the US version of the comic, Inferno did not make an appearance until after the battle with [[Unicron]] and shortly after this, his wreckage is seen in the aftermath of [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]]'s ambush. He was soon after resurrected by the coming of Optimus Prime and the [[Last Autobot]]. 

''Inferno featured in the UK version of the comic before the battle with [[Unicron]] happened, however featured most prominently afterwards in the ''Legacy of [[Unicron]]'' storyline where he died crashing a shuttle into a large group of Decepticons. Inferno also appeared in the ''Rhythms of Darkness'' storyline set in an alternate universe, where he is one of the few Autobots still alive on Earth.''

He would also appear briefly in the ''[[Transformers: Generation 2]]'' comic. Whilst battling the second generation Cybertronian forces of [[Jhiaxus]], he saw his friend [[Smokescreen (Transformers)|Smokescreen]] gunned down. In a rage, Inferno killed all of the enemy soldiers, only to be ambushed by more of them - however whilst diving for cover, a building collapsed on top of him.

===Animated series===
Inferno first appeared in the episode "Dinobot Island, Part 2", alongside [[Red Alert (Transformers)|Red Alert]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anime.com/Transformers/ |title=Transformers Season Two Box Set, Part 1 by Brian Cirulnick, February 2003 |publisher=Anime.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref> with no explanation or origin. He was featured prominently in the episode "Auto-Beserk", also alongside Red Alert. In the episode "Prime Target", Inferno was captured by big game hunter [[Lord Cholmondeley]], along with a several other Autobots in an attempt to lure Optimus Prime into a trap. Inferno is part of a team led by [[Ironhide]] to track down Optimus Prime on Cybertron in "The Search for Alpha Trion", and meets his old flame [[Firestar (Transformers)|Firestar]]. Walker Edmiston is the voice actor for Inferno.<ref>Sid and Marty Krofft: A Critical Study of Saturday Morning Children's by Hal Erickson</ref> Like his fellow Autobot Ironhide, Inferno speaks with a thick southern US accent.

Inferno also appears in the end credits of ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'' despite not actually appearing in it, leading to speculation that Inferno's scenes were cut or that he was intended to feature. After the movie, he never made any more appearances. An early script of the movie appeared on eBay revealing that Inferno was part of the Autobot team under Ultra Magnus in Autobot City.<REF>http://www.allspark.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=89698</REF>

In the Japanese [[Headmasters]] series, Inferno appears in the first and third episodes, under the command of Ultra Magnus on Earth.

===IDW Publishing===
Inferno in ''IDW Publishing's'' adaptation, was on the Autobot Orbital Command Hub in ''Spotlight: Blaster'', where he was present when Blaster was recovered and returned to the Autobots.

===Toys===
* '''''Generation 1'' Inferno''' (1985/2003)
:This toy was originally a Japanese Diaclone toy, modelled on a Japanese Mitsubishi Fuso firetruck. Both of his arms feature spring-loaded missile launchers, though the [[Hasbro]] version (in contrast to the Takara version) severely weakened the strength of them for child safety reasons. The Inferno mold was partially remolded to create the molds for [[Grapple (Transformers)|Grapple]] (1985), Headmasters Artfire (1987), and e-Hobby RoadHauler (2003).
:In 2003, Inferno was re-released as part of Takara's "Transformers Collection" series with [[tampograph]]s instead of stickers and with blue eyes instead of yellow ones. These changes were carried over into Hasbro's "Commemorative Series" Inferno, Grapple, and RoadHauler. This toy, slightly modified, was knocked off and used in [[Phoenix-bot Phoenix King|Phoenix King]], a Korean animated film. It was released in the US as "Defenders of Space". Another bargain film, ''Space Thunder Kids'', used scenes of "Inferno" from this movie.

:The original Inferno toy was re-released as part of the Transformers Generation 2 toyline with slight modifications, such as the removal of his spring-loaded missiles, a tampographed Autobot symbol, and a water squinter.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Transformers: The Fantasy, The Fun, The Future| last=Brereton | first=Erin | year=2006 | publisher=Triumph Books| ISBN=1-57243-983-1 | page= 22}}</ref>

* '''''Universe'' Inferno''' (2009)
:Released as a Voyager price point toy as part of the "Generation 2 Series" of the Universe toyline, Inferno transforms into a fictional six-wheeled variant of the Pierce Contender 2002-2007 series of firetrucks. The toy also has the tampographed number "401" on its side, which is the area code for the state of Rhode Island, where Hasbro has its headquarters. This mold was also used to make the [[BotCon]] 2010 exclusive Spark and was retooled to make the 2010 series Solar Storm Grappel.

Insane and arsonistic, '''Inferno''' delights in causing pain and suffering while blasting opponents with twin [[flamethrowers]]. During his first encounter with [[Quickstrike]], he claimed that ''"Pain is my friend! Allow me to introduce YOU to it!" '' before giving the Fuzor a severe pounding. When [[Megatron (Beast Wars and Beast Machines)|Megatron]] first witnessed Inferno's insane vigor for violence, he commented, ''"Oooh, I ''like'' him!"'' Inferno was extremely tough and powerful, while at the same time being amazingly loyal, even igniting energon crystals rather than lose them to the Maximals, as per Megatron<U+2019>s orders. In keeping with his ant instincts, he was one of the few Predacons genuinely loyal to Megatron, and always refers to him as "''the Royalty''" or "''the Queen''" (although he rarely used the latter in public after Megatron nearly strangled him after one too many uses of the term). Additionally, he referred to the Predacon Base as "The [[ant colony|Colony]]" (and at one point "The Nest") and his comrades as drones, drawing some amount of dissatisfaction from them. Despite this, Inferno would prove surprisingly sociable, often playing cards with his fellow Predacons ("Changing of the Guard").

Bob Forward revealed in 1997 that Inferno was originally planned by Hasbro to be "the new Megatron [toy]. We were going to kill Megatron and bring him back as Inferno." [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.toys.transformers/msg/bc8e54e9165e0823?hl=en&&q=bob+forward+interview+inferno+megatron]

===Animated series===
Inferno was originally a [[Maximal (Transformers)|Maximal]] [[protoform]] who was converted into a [[Predacon (Transformers)|Predacon]] by [[Tarantulas (Transformers)|Tarantulas]], who had originally intended to recruit a third arachnid loyal only to him, as well as gain the stasis pod for himself to escape the planet. However, the scanner in Inferno<U+2019>s pod had already scanned a [[fire ant]] before Tarantulas arrived. A glitch in this process (and possibly Tarantulas' faulty programming) resulted in Inferno's beast instincts heavily influencing his robot mode. He believed he was an actual fire ant, protecting his "colony" (the stasis pod), which was soon destroyed by [[Tigatron]]. An enraged Inferno was seconds away from killing him when he was blown apart by [[Optimus Primal]]. Repaired after this, Inferno joined the [[Predacon (Transformers)|Predacon]] ranks, reprogrammed to believing Megatron to be his <U+201C>queen", the base to be his <U+201C>colony<U+201D> and the other Predacons as fellow <U+201C>drones<U+201D>. His arsonistic tendencies and impenetrable personal loyalty to Megatron (whom he often referred to as his "[[Queen (insect)|Queen]]", or "the Royalty", much to Megatron's chagrin) forgive his quirks. This favored treatment would lead to a rivalry with Megatron's current second-in-command [[Scorponok#Beast Wars|Scorponok]], as the brutish Predacon considered the fanatically loyal Inferno as a threat to his position.

Inferno quickly made an impact on the Predacons, frequently leading the other flyers ([[Waspinator]] and [[Terrorsaur]]) on missions, although his desire for destruction often meant he disregarded any semblance of a plan. He also obtained revenge on Tigatron, killing his white tiger companion Snowstalker during a mission. Inferno was considered loyal enough to be sent on a solo mission to retrieve the alien second [[Golden Disk]] artifact from a mountain cave. Later, he was sent after [[Tarantulas (Transformers)|Tarantulas]] and [[Blackarachnia]] when they tried to escape in a modified stasis pod, incinerating Tarantulas.

Inferno was one of the stars of the 1997 BotCon Convention Comics, a story set near the end of season one of the ''Beast Wars'' television series. In the Convention Comics plot, Inferno and [[Blackarachnia]] watched as the Predacon scientist [[Fractyl]] attempted to invent ''Energon Armor'' capable of protecting them from energon build up. Although seemingly successful, the armor was stolen by the Maximal thief [[Packrat (Transformers)|Packrat]]. Blackarachinia and Fractyl realized the energon armor was flawed and could destroy the planet if it came in contact with large amounts of energon. Inferno pursued Packrat, but since Packrat didn't need to assume beast mode with the armor on, he got the upper hand in the fight with Inferno.

Scorponok and Inferno<U+2019>s rivalry was rendered moot after Scorponok supposedly died falling into a lava pit. After this, Inferno was promoted to sub-commander throughout the second and third seasons.

At the start of season two, he was still at the Maximal base, but inactive and imprisoned. When Blackarachnia turned off the energized cells to get Tarantulas' body, he was reactivated and freed. During the time he was free, Megatron was attacking the base. He soon fought with [[Dinobot]] and [[Rhinox]], but was kicked out by Rhinox. When Megatron saw him, Megatron sounded surprised, as he probably thought that Inferno was dead. The Predacons were soon out numbered when [[Waspinator]] and Blackarachnia retreated, so Megatron retreated as well with Inferno.

He proved to be a great fighter in several occasions; he was the first one to fight the [[Fuzors]], he had a cowboy-themed showdown with the newly resurrected Optimus Primal, he faced-off with the traitor, Dinobot, he helped take down the human civilization until Dinobot cut through him, and he tried to get the stasis pod which contained Transmutate, only to get blown away by [[Transmutate]] itself.

In the season finale, he tried to kill Optimus Primal and [[Cheetor]] by exploding the energon crystals. His plan failed and he almost destroyed himself.

Inferno was seen to still function at the start of the third series. He continued to serve Megatron loyally, even when commanded to help destroy the original Optimus Prime (which had he succeeded, would eliminate Inferno's existence, as he was a maximal protoform, however, he was never actually shown in reality flux). He scored a major victory for the Predacons when he managed to recover the Maximal defense computer Sentinel. Shadowing his earlier rivalry with [[Scorponok]], Inferno had somewhat of a rivalry with the Transmetal II [[Dinobot]] clone, whose seeming loyalty to Megatron's rivaled his own. Inferno then took on any and every mission regardless of danger to hopefully win back his Royalty's favor. A recurring gag throughout Season Three was Inferno getting blasted by defense turrets in front of the Maximal base.

In the finale, Inferno led [[Quickstrike]] and [[Waspinator]] in search of a new "colony" after the Predacon Base was destroyed by [[Tigerhawk]]. Inferno decided that the caves of the humans would be suitable and he and Quickstrike attacked the base, after Waspinator defected. As Inferno tried to annihilate the human leader, Megatron appeared in the skies on board the Decepticon warship, the ''[[Nemesis (Transformers)|Nemesis]]'' to take revenge on the human, and unknowingly destroyed Inferno and Quickstrike in the process, blowing them to pieces with one blast. His parts along with Quickstrike's were later used by the human settlement as tools (notably his head is comically used as a bongo drum).

Throughout the ''Beast Wars'' series, Inferno was one of only three characters to last the entire series without receiving some type of upgrade (the others being [[Rhinox]] and [[Waspinator]]).

===IDW Publishing===
Inferno had a biography printed in the ''Beast Wars Sourcebook'' by [[IDW Publishing]].<ref>http://www.monstersandcritics.com/books/comics/news/article_1343405.php/Creators_of_Transformers_Beast_Wars_The_Gathering_are_back</ref>

* '''''Universe'' Deluxe Inferno (2003)'''
:Inferno is the name of an Autobot toy, a recolor of ''Robots in Disguise'' [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] who was colored as a homage to the original Autobot [[Red Alert (Transformers)|Red Alert]]. Of all the initial characters in the ''Transformers: Universe'' toy line Inferno was the only one to lack any tech spec, bio, or appearance in any fiction, leaving his character a complete mystery. According to rumors the toy was originally going to be called Red Alert, and ''Universe'' Autobot Ratchet was to be called Inferno, but the names were swapped in a production mistake for this toy, so they had to rename the other toy as well.

Despite the name already being used for an ''Armada'' Mini-Con, the Inferno moniker was reused for a character in ''Transformers: Energon''. This Inferno is an Autobot and physically a homage to the original Inferno. He was later upgraded and given the name Roadblock.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Transformers The Ultimate Guide|last=Furman|first=Simon|year=2004|publisher=DK Publications|ISBN=978-0-7566-3012-6|page=130}}</ref>

Inferno's tech spec portrayed him as the epitome of what an Autobot should be. He always cares for his teammates, and is careful to always think of the consequences of his acts, unlike his [[Powerlink (Transformers)|Powerlink]]ing partner [[Hot Shot (Transformers)|Hot Shot]]. In the series he took over [[Smokescreen (Transformers)|Smokescreen]]'s role from ''Armada'' as the Autobot sniper.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Transformers: Identification and Price Guide | last=Bellemo | first=Mark | year=2007 | publisher=Krause Publications| ISBN=0-89689-445-2| page=230 }}</ref>

===Animated series===
The level-headed master sniper of Team Optimus Prime, Inferno transforms into a fire engine and possesses the Spark of Combination, frequently combining with [[Hot Shot (Transformers)|Hot Shot]]. He tended to play no major role until the Autobots were transported to a new region of space where [[Alpha Q]] had successfully recreated the planets destroyed by Unicron. Here, on Iron Planet, Inferno was charged with guarding [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockblast]], but an attack by the Decepticons saw [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]] infuse Inferno with his own energies, trying to brand him with the Decepticon symbol and turn him to his side. Inferno fought the influence in a series of Jekyll-and-Hyde-like transformations, eventually plunging himself into the Energon Sun when he couldn't hold it back no more. Thankfully, [[Jetfire]] was able to recover his Spark and had a new body constructed for him, recreating Inferno as ''Roadblock'' ('''Inferno V''' in Japan), who now transformed into a truck crane. For much of the remainder of the series, Roadblock was staying at Ocean Planet, until Optimus called to him. Joining with the other Autobots, they merged into Optimus Supreme, fighting a Unicron-possessed Galvatron.

===Dreamwave Productions===
Inferno first appeared in issue #19 of the Dreamwave Transformers: Energon comic series. He fought against [[Unicron]]'s four Horsemen ([[Rhinox]], [[Terrorsaur]], [[Airazor]] and [[Cheetor]]). Badly injured, he was reformatted into his [[Powerlink (Transformers)|Powerlink]]ing body by the power of [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]], allowing him and the other Autobots to drive off the Horsemen. He then went to Earth alongside [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]] and battled against [[Scorponok]]'s [[Terrorcon]]s. Later, he was one of the defenders of [[Moscow]] against the endless horde of [[Ravage (Transformers)|Battle Ravage]] clones. Although they looked doomed, they received help from a surprising source - [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]], resurrected in a new body by Prime. Megatron routed the clones, allowing the Autobots to recover. Dreamwave's Energon comic ended at this point, forestalling any future stories of Inferno.

===Pack in comics===
In the second ''Transformers: Energon'' pack in comic [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]], Inferno and [[Landmine (Transformers)|Landmine]] discover some hills on Earth that are rich with energon and call in to [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]] that they should put an energon tower up. Optimus warns the Autobots that Decepticon activity has been scanned nearby. [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]] attacks with a horde of [[Divebomb]] [[Terrorcon]] clones. The Autobots attempt by fight back by having Mirage and Inferno Powerlinx while Landmine goes into brute mode, but they are overwhelmed when [[Insecticon]] Terrorcon hordes join in the attack. The Autobots retreat and Megatron takes the energon for himself.
