{{Jehovah's Witnesses}}'''James Penton''' is a [[professor emeritus]] of [[history]] at the [[University of Lethbridge]] in [[Lethbridge]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] and the author of three books on the history of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. Although raised in the religion, he was expelled in 1981 on the grounds of [[apostasy]] after criticizing some of the teachings and conduct of the religion's leadership. His expulsion gained national media attention and prompted one of several schisms that year among Jehovah's Witnesses.<ref name="linda">{{cite book  | last = Edwards | first = Linda  | title = A Brief Guide to Beliefs | publisher = Westminster John Knox Press  | date = 2001 | location = Louisville, Kentucky | pages = 440| isbn = 0-664-22259-5 }}</ref>

==Background==

Born in April 1932, Penton was raised as a fourth-generation Jehovah's Witnesses, experiencing as a child Canadian government restrictions on the religion's activities.<ref name="preface">{{Cite book| last = Penton | first = M.J. | title = Apocalypse Delayed | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 1997 | chapter= Preface | isbn = 0802079733, 9780802079732}}</ref> He was baptized in June 1948 and served in various capacities in Jehovah's Witness congregations in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada while pursuing an academic career, before moving to Alberta in 1965.<ref name = "letter2">James A. Beverley, ''Crisis of Allegiance'', Welch Publishing Company, Burlington, Ontario, 1986, ISBN 0920413374, Appendix, letter 2.</ref> Penton claimed to be an [[Jehovah's Witnesses beliefs#144,000 anointed|anointed]] Christian, and therefore one of the religion's [[faithful and discreet slave]] class, which is said to be collectively used by [[Jesus Christ]] to "feed" his followers with scriptural instruction.

==Dissent==

While serving as an elder in his Lethbridge congregation in the late 1970s he developed concerns over the Watch Tower Society<U+2019>s emphasis on the requirement for Witnesses to engage in public preaching work and what he saw as a growing harshness and intolerance in the treatment of members of the religion by those in authority.<ref>James A. Beverley, ''Crisis of Allegiance'', Welch Publishing Company, Burlington, Ontario, 1986, ISBN 0920413374, Appendix, page 29.</ref>

On August 10, 1979 he sent an eight-page letter to the society detailing his concerns. He opened the letter by saying he would <U+201C>write lovingly but candidly about what I believe to be the central problem in our organization <U+2013> the thing which has sickened it and for which the Governing Body as such must take much direct responsibility<U+201D>.

{{cquote| ... It is the Society<U+2019>s misplaced, unscriptural overemphasis on the preaching work which has sickened, is sickening and will continue to sicken the organization until it is placed in its proper perspective. Although it is a necessary aspect of the Christian congregation<U+2019>s testimony to the world, it is no important than any other Christian works outlined in the Scriptures ... many are tired to the point of spiritual death itself by the super-pietism and work-righteousness pervading the organization.<ref>James A. Beverley, ''Crisis of Allegiance'', Welch Publishing Company, Burlington, Ontario, 1986, ISBN 0920413374, Appendix, letter 1.</ref>}} 
Penton gave examples of what he claimed were distortions of New Testament texts to support Watch Tower Society teachings on house-to-house preaching, criticized the appointment of elders chiefly on the basis of field service records and described circuit overseer visits as <U+201C>military inspections<U+201D>. He also sought a re-emphasis on justification by faith.<ref name="linda" />

The letter, which was distributed among some Witnesses in Lethbridge, prompted accusations that Penton was denigrating and opposed to the preaching work and resulted in talks by the circuit and district overseers in Lethbridge warning that those who opposed the religion<U+2019>s [[Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses|Governing Body]] would be destroyed by God. Penton resigned as an elder in December 1979, but a day later withdrew the resignation. He received a one-page reply to his letter from the society's headquarters in January 1980 that urged him to adjust his viewpoint or remain silent.

Despite his protests that he was the subject of a witch hunt and injustice<ref name="letter2" /> because of expressing his view about a religion he had once hailed as a "champion of free speech", Penton was disfellowshipped, or expelled, from Jehovah's Witnesses on the grounds of apostasy in February 1981.<ref>James A. Beverley, ''Crisis of Allegiance'', Welch Publishing Company, Burlington, Ontario, 1986, ISBN 0920413374, pages 22, 32, 71.</ref> His expulsion triggered a schism among Lethbridge Witnesses, as 80 supporters<U+2013>about a quarter of all local members<U+2013>severed ties or were expelled from the religion.<ref>James A. Beverley, ''Crisis of Allegiance'', Welch Publishing Company, Burlington, Ontario, 1986, ISBN 0920413374, page 67.</ref><ref name="linda" /> The events surrounding his expulsion gained widespread media attention including national television coverage<ref>James A. Beverley, ''Crisis of Allegiance'', Welch Publishing Company, Burlington, Ontario, 1986, ISBN 0920413374, page 12.</ref> and were the subject of a 1986 book, ''Crisis of Allegiance'', by James A. Beverley, an assistant professor at Atlantic Baptist College in [[Moncton]], [[New Brunswick]], Canada.

==Books==

While still a member, he wrote ''Jehovah<U+2019>s Witnesses in Canada: Champions of Freedom of Speech and Worship'' (1976), a history of the religion's struggle for religious freedom under Canadian law, in which he claimed that much of the political and theological attacks on the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]] had been grossly unfair. He subsequently appeared on a national current affairs television program in Canada defending the religion's doctrines and denying they were guilty of false prophecy.<ref>James A. Beverley, ''Crisis of Allegiance'', Welch Publishing Company, Burlington, Ontario, 1986, ISBN 0920413374, page 11.</ref> The book gained brief mentions in the society's magazine ''The Watchtower'' (quoting a ''Toronto Star'' review) and three years later in a ''Yearbook'' article about the Witnesses' history in Canada, although Penton later wrote that he found it curious that the society refused to quote directly from it or otherwise mention it in publications or conventions. "As a result," he wrote, "some Witnesses manifested direct hostility towards it. On occasions I was openly criticized by particularly narrow Witnesses with 'trying to make money on the brothers' or 'trying to make a big fellow out of myself'."<ref>{{Cite book| last = Penton | first = M.J. | title = Apocalypse Delayed | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 1997 | page 359, footnote 28 | isbn = 0802079733, 9780802079732}}</ref>

He began work on ''Apocalypse Delayed: The Story of Jehovah's Witnesses'' soon afterwards, but halted his research and writing in 1979 after developing concerns over what he viewed as a growing punitive response of the religion's leadership to doctrinal dissent from within its ranks.<ref name="preface" /> He resumed work on the book after his expulsion and it was published in 1985. In 2004 he published ''Jehovah's Witnesses and the Third Reich: Sectarian Politics under Persecution'', which highlights what he claims are discrepancies between the religion's official history of its opposition to [[Nazism]] during [[World War II]] and documented facts.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Jehovahs-Witnesses-Third-Reich-Persecution/dp/0802089275/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1331983820&sr=8-3 ''Jehovah's Witnesses and the Third Reich'', Amazon.com.]</ref> He has edited two journals, written five [[Article (publishing)|articles]] about Jehovah's Witnesses and also wrote the Canadian Encyclopedia's entry about the religion.<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/jehovahs-witnesses "Jehovah's Witnesses", Canadian Encyclopedia.]</ref>
