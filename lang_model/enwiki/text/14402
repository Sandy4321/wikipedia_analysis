'''''Blackwater Park''''' is the fifth studio album by [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[progressive metal|progressive]] [[death metal]] band [[Opeth]]. The album was released on February 27, 2001 on [[Music for Nations]] and [[Koch Records]]. The album marks the first collaboration between [[Porcupine Tree]] frontman [[Steven Wilson]] and the band, as Wilson had been brought in to produce the album, which led to a considerable shift in Opeth's musical style.

''Blackwater Park'' did not chart in North America or the United Kingdom and had two singles released from it: "[[The Drapery Falls]]" and "[[Still Day Beneath the Sun]]". ''Blackwater Park'' was highly acclaimed on its initial release and has been praised by critics, with Eduardo Rivadavia of [[Allmusic]] stating that the album is "surely the band's coming-of-age album, and therefore, an ideal introduction to its remarkable body of work".<ref name="allmusic" />

==Production==
Following a few live dates in [[Europe]], Opeth's guitarist and vocalist [[Mikael <U+00C5>kerfeldt]] went to an old friend's house in [[Stockholm, Sweden]] to record some demos and just relax and wait for some inspiration to hit.<ref name="Chapter 5">{{cite web| author=<U+00C5>kerfeldt, Mikael |url=http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter5.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080205072409/http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter5.html |archivedate=2008-02-05 |title=Opeth Chapter 5 |publisher=Opeth.com |accessdate=2008-01-12}}</ref> The album is named after the [[Music of Germany|German]] [[progressive rock]] band of the [[Blackwater Park (band)|same name]] and was the first album for which the group had a title before they started recording.<ref name="allmusic" /><ref name="diary1"/> A few months later when <U+00C5>kerfeldt was having dinner with [[Porcupine Tree]] frontman [[Steven Wilson]], <U+00C5>kerfeldt discussed the idea of Wilson producing the next Opeth album.<ref name="Chapter 5" /> After <U+00C5>kerfeldt sent Wilson the demos he had recorded, Wilson agreed to produce the album.<ref name="Chapter 5" /> 

Opeth entered to [[Studio Fredman]] to begin work on ''Blackwater Park'' on August 10, 2000.<ref name="Chapter 5" /> The band had no previous lyrics written and had only rehearsed three times before entering the studio.<ref name="Chapter 5" /> The band's [[audio engineer|engineer]] [[Fredrik Nordstr<U+00F6>m]] had arranged for the group to stay in a small room in the Studio that had four beds.<ref name="diary1" /> Opeth stayed there for around two weeks and then later rented out [[Dark Tranquillity]] member [[Mikael Stanne]]'s flat.<ref name="diary1" /> After recording the basic drums, rhythms, bass and acoustic guitars, Wilson arrived to produce the clean vocals and add some guitar leads. <U+00C5>kerfeldt wrote that Wilson had an "immense impact on the recording" and after working with him the group entered "a new phase".<ref name="diary1">{{cite web| author=<U+00C5>kerfeldt, Mikael |url=http://www.opeth.com/index.php/discography/show/tpl/blackwater-session-diary  |title=Blackwater Session Diary |publisher=Opeth.com |accessdate=2009-05-11}}</ref>

They were working all the time. When they came into the kitchen for a break, we're still there, on the same break we took 3 hours ago. We don't want this to become a 'job', or something you do because you have to. We wanna have a good time, and thus we only work when it feels right."<ref name="diary2" />
