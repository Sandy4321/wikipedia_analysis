'''Hilda Lucia Solis''' ({{IPA-en|s<U+0275><U+02C8>li<U+02D0>s|pron}}; born October 20, 1957) is the 25th [[United States Secretary of Labor]], serving in the [[Obama administration]]. She is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 2001 to 2009, representing the [[California's 31st congressional district|31st]] and [[California's 32nd congressional district|32nd congressional districts]] of [[California]] that include [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] and the [[San Gabriel Valley]].

Solis was raised in [[La Puente, California]] by immigrant parents from [[Nicaragua]] and [[Mexico]]. She gained degrees from the [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona]] (Cal Poly Pomona) and the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) and worked for two federal agencies in [[Washington, D.C.]] Returning to her native state, she was elected to the Rio Hondo Community College Board of Trustees in 1985, the [[California State Assembly]] in 1992, and the [[California State Senate]] in 1994. She was the first [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] woman to serve in the State Senate, and was reelected there in 1998. She became known for her work toward [[environmental justice]] and was the first female recipient of the [[Profile in Courage Award|John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award]] in 2000.

Solis defeated a long-time Democratic incumbent as part of getting elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, where she focused mainly on labor causes and environmental work. She was reelected easily to four subsequent terms. In December 2008, President-elect [[Barack Obama]] announced his intention to nominate Solis as the next [[United States Secretary of Labor]]. She took office after being confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] in February 2009, becoming the first Hispanic woman to serve in the [[United States Cabinet|U.S. Cabinet]].
