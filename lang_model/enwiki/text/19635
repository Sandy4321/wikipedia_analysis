"'''Terms of Endearment'''" is the seventh episode of the [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth season]] of the American [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]'', and originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network on January&nbsp;3, 1999. Written by David Amann and directed by [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]], "Terms of Endearment" is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. It earned a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 10.5 and was watched by 18.7 million people on its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed reviews. While the performance given by guest actor [[Bruce Campbell]] attracted positive comments, the plot was criticised.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal called [[X-File]]s. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In the installment, an unborn child is apparently abducted from its mother's womb by a demon after the prospective parents discover that their child has birth defects. After the FBI dismisses the assignment as irrelevant to the X-Files, Mulder and Scully steal the case and investigate the creature. While looking into the report, the duo discover that Wayne Weinsider (Campbell) is a child-abducting demon.

"Terms of Endearment", an inversion of the 1968 film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', was the first episode written by ''The X-Files''{{'}} executive story editor David Amann, a staff member who later became a regular contributor to the series. Campbell, already well known as a [[cult film]] actor in several [[Sam Raimi]] horror movies, was cast as Wayne Weinsider. Many of the episode's special effects were created without elaborate computer-generated effects. Critics have complimented the episode's unique representation of its antagonist, who has been classified as a sympathetic villain.

==Plot==
In [[Roanoke, Virginia]], Wayne Weinsider ([[Bruce Campbell]]) and his pregnant wife Laura learn via an [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound scan]] that their unborn child has bizarre physical abnormalities, such as horn-like protrusions. Weinsider appears to be especially distraught after hearing the news. That night, Laura has a terrifying dream in which a [[demon]]-like figure snatches the baby from her womb. When she wakes up, the couple discover that Laura has seemingly [[miscarriage|miscarried]]. Laura's brother, local [[deputy sheriff]] Arky Stevens, reports her story to the [[X-File]]s section at the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. Agent [[Jeffrey Spender]] ([[Chris Owens (actor)|Chris Owens]]) discards the report, but Agent [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) salvages the case and travels to Virginia, along with Agent [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) to interview the Weinsiders.

The police, who suspect an illegal abortion, find the remains of the baby in the garden furnace. Wayne quickly confesses to destroying the evidence. He asserts that his wife had aborted the child while in a trance-like state. Laura takes the blame for the abortion and goes to jail. Meanwhile the Wayne has an affair with another pregnant woman, named Betsy Monroe. Mulder reaches the conclusion that Wayne is a demon who is trying to have a normal baby; he terminates pregnancies when the fetus exhibits demon-like abnormalities. Betsy has a similar dream, but recognizes the dream-demon as Weinsider. Nevertheless, she loses her baby and tracks down Mulder and Scully. The two seek out Weinsider and catch him digging in Laura's backyard. After a short conversation, the sheriff arrives at the house and shoots Weinsider.

Mulder and Scully discover remains of normal human babies in Betsy's yard where Weinsider was digging. Upon seeing the evidence, Mulder deduces that Betsy is another demon who is unable to have a baby demon spawn unless another demon impregnates her. Unlike Weinsider, she has been terminating pregnancies that resulted in non-demonic fetuses: the very type Weinsider has been so desperate to father. As a demon, she could recognize her husband as a demon in her dream, and stop him extracting her baby. However, it becomes apparent that she never lost her baby; it was merely a trick to frame her demon husband. At the end of the narrative, Betsy Monroe drives away with her new demon baby. Her eyes flash with a red gleam before returning back to normal.<ref name="plot"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-x-files-terms-of-endearment-v210681/ |title=The X-Files: Terms of Endearment (1999) |work=[[AllMovie]] |publisher=[[All Media Guide]] |date= |accessdate=November 27, 2009}}</ref>

==Production==

===Background===
[[File:Chris Carter (July 2008).jpg|alt=A man with white hair is looking and smiling at the camera.|''[[The X-Files]]'' creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] greenlit the episode, following a pitch provided by David Amann.|190px|thumb|right]]

"Terms of Endearment" was the first episode written by ''The X-Files'' executive story editor David Amann. Amann had previously written two network movies titled ''[[The Man Who Wouldn't Die (1995 film)|The Man Who Wouldn't Die]]'' and ''Dead Air'' and had served two years on the staff of the [[CBS]] [[medical drama]] ''[[Chicago Hope]]''. The concept for "Terms of Endearment" was "about the fifth or sixth idea" Amann came up with for the show.<ref name="m79"/> Amann's original idea was to write what he described as "''Rosemary's Baby'' in reverse".<ref name="m79"/> He explained, "I had this idea [for doing the episode] not from the point of view of the hapless woman unwittingly impregnated, but from the point of view of the devil".<ref name="m79"/> Amann pitched his idea to series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], who gave him the commission to write the rest of the episode.<ref name="m79"/><ref name="m78">[[#Meisler|Meisler (2000)]], p. 78</ref>

According to Amann, the initial draft was "heavier on pure shock value and lighter on humor and human interest".<ref name="m79"/> In this version, Laura Weinsider was slated to give birth to a serpent rather than a demon baby. In addition, the story unraveled in a more "linear" fashion.<ref name="m79"/> This draft also called for the devil to seek a human baby, resulting in the sacrifice of his wife. The series regular writers felt that this initial version of the story had a certain "inevitability" to it.<ref name="m79"/> Carter, however, suggested that the second woman should be a demon. Amann later admitted that this addition made the story "work well".<ref name="m79">[[#Meisler|Meisler (2000)]], p. 79</ref> Kerry Fall from ''DVD Journal'' suggested that the plot revolved around "the wives and lives of a demon trying to have a normal child."<ref>{{cite web|last=Fall|first=Kerry|title=The X-Files: Season Six|url=http://www.dvdjournal.com/quickreviews/x/xfiles.season6.q.shtml|publisher=DVD Journal|accessdate=11 January 2012}}</ref>

The score for "Terms of Endearment" was composed by series regular [[Mark Snow]], who used [[Gregorian chant]]s to give the atmosphere a "creepy" feel.<ref name="m79"/> The 1995 song "[[Only Happy When It Rains]]" by [[alternative rock]] group [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]] plays several times in the episode, most notably when Betsy Monroe drives away with her demon baby.<ref name="happy">[[#Meisler|Meisler (2000)]], p. 73</ref><ref>{{Cite music release notes|Name=[[Only Happy When It Rains]]|Type=single|Artist=[[Garbage (band)|Garbage]]|Year=1995|Format=UK CD/cassette Single liner notes|Publisher=[[A&E Records#Mushroom Records UK|Mushroom Records UK]]|PID=D1199/C1199}}</ref> The quote "Zazas, zazas, nasatanada zazas"<U+2014>what Laura Weinsider was to have said while "in a trance"<U+2014>is what the [[occult]]ist [[Aleister Crowley]] used to open the 10th Aethyr of the [[Thelema|Thelemic]] demon [[Choronzon]].<ref>[[#Owen|Owen (2000)]], p. 186</ref> "Terms of Endearment" is not the first occasion that the series drew influence from Crowley; a high school from the episode "[[Die Hand Die Verletzt]]" was named after him as well.<ref name="messy"/><ref name="crowley">[[#Lowry|Lowry (1995)]], p. 195</ref>

===Casting===
[[File:David Duchovny 2011 Shankbone.JPG|alt=A man standing in front of purple background.|[[David Duchovny]] (''pictured'') entertained himself during production by playing pranks with [[Bruce Campbell]]. |170px|thumb|left]]

Rick Millikan selected Lisa Jane Persky, who was at the top of his casting "wish list", for the role of Laura.<ref name="m79"/> In the middle of filming, a cast member withdrew from the production for religious reasons. A mother withdrew her baby from the cast during the final run-through of the "cursed-birth" scene. Although a fan of the show, as a devout Catholic she was uncomfortable with her child representing a demon. Director Rob Bowman assured her that the production staff understood her dilemma; the casting staff quickly called down and found a replacement in less than 45 minutes. It was the first time during the filming of the series that a cast-member withdrew for religious reasons.<ref name="m78"/>

[[Bruce Campbell]], known for taking leading roles in Sam Raimi horror movies such as ''[[The Evil Dead (franchise)|The Evil Dead]]'' trilogy, was cast as the episode's antagonist Wayne Weinsider.<ref name="EVIL">[[#Kenneth Muir|Kenneth Muir (2004)]], p. 112</ref><ref>[[#Lowry|Lowry (1995)]], p. 4</ref> Campbell had previously worked for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network on his short lived series ''[[The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.]]'', which began as the lead-in show for ''The X-Files'' during the [[The X-Files (season 1)|first season]].<ref>{{cite journal | title = X'd Out | journal = [[Cinefantastique]] | date = 2002-04 | first = Paula | last = Vitaris | coauthors = Dan Coyle | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | page = 38| id = }}</ref><ref name="p1921">[[#Lowry|Lowry (1995)]], pp.19<U+2013>21</ref> Fox had initially assumed that ''Brisco County, Jr.'' was going to be the more successful series, while ''The X-Files'' was more unappreciatively referred to as "the other drama Fox ordered that spring".<ref>[[#Lowry|Lowry (1995)]], p. 19</ref><ref name="Campbell258"/><ref name="book">[[#Booker|Booker (2002)]], p. 122</ref> Several of the individuals who worked on the failed ''Brisco County, Jr.'' series later found a career working on ''The X-Files'', which led Campbell to call the process a "coming home" experience.<ref name="Campbell258"/>

Campbell first met both Duchovny and Anderson during the promotional campaigns for both series in 1993.<ref name="Campbell258">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p. 258</ref> He commented that, although Duchovny was known for playing a serious role on the show, in real life he was quite a funny person.<ref name="Campbell257"/><ref name="funny"/> During shooting, Campbell and Duchovny entertained themselves on set by pranking the crew members, eventually stopping it when crew members became upset.<ref name="Campbell257">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p. 257</ref> Although Campbell had a positive opinion of working on the show, he commented that the nature of the show did not allow for much improvisation, describing the production as a "well oiled machine".<ref name=funny>{{cite web|last=Kleinman|first=Geoffrey|title=Bruce Campbell <U+2013> Chat Transcript|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/interviews/bruce_campbell.html|work=[[DVD Talk]]|publisher=[[Internet Brands]]|accessdate=11 August 2012}}</ref><ref>[[#Campbell2|Campbell (2005)]], p. 10</ref>

===Filming===
[[File:Los Angeles, CA from the air.jpg|alt=An aerial view of a widespread built-up area, skyscrapers in the central district, with mountains in the background.|"Terms of Endearment" was filmed in Los Angeles, as were the rest of the episodes of the sixth season.|thumb|300px|right]]

The first five seasons of the series were mainly filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia; production of the show's sixth season, however, was based in Los Angeles, California.<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]], Rabwin, Paul and [[Kim Manners|Manners, Kim]] |year=2000 |title=The Truth About Season Six |medium= DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Vitaris|first=Paula|title=X-Files: A Mixed Bag of Episodes and a Feature Film Pave the Way for Season Six|journal=Cinefantastique|date=October 1998|volume=30|issue=7/8|page=27}}</ref> The principal outdoor filming for "Terms of Endearment" took place in and around Pasadena, called "the most East Coast-like part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area" by Andy Meisler in his book ''The End and the Beginning''.<ref name="m79"/> The car featured in the episode was a [[Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)|Chevrolet Camaro Z28]] convertible. Meisler, sardonically, wrote that [[General Motors]] had "no qualms about seeing their vehicles driven onscreen by a relative of [[Satan]]".<ref name="m79"/>

Several of the special effects used in the episode were created in a "low-stress" manner that did not rely wholly on [[CGI|Computer-generated imagery]]. During the childbirth scene, gas-burners were set a distance away from a fire-proof bed. The scene was then filmed with a long lens to give the effect that the fire was mere inches away from the bed.<ref name="m79"/> Producer [[John Shiban]] said that the film crew made "a big deal out of the eyes" to make the scene frightening.<ref name="sfx">{{cite video |people=[[Paul Rabwin]] |year=1999 |title=Special Effects with Paul Rabwin: Devil/Fire Comp |location=''[[The X-Files (season 6)|The X-Files: The Complete Sixth Season]]'' |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> The devil sonogram was created by using the videotape of a real sonogram of a crew member's wife. The videotape was then edited to give it a demonic look.<ref name="m79"/>

The burnt baby skeleton was built from scratch. Originally, the crew had planned on renting a real fetal skeleton, but the $3,000 cost forced them to make their own. Office manager Donovan Brown noted that, "we got two or three of those adults skeleton models, cut a foot or so off a leg here and shortened an arm there, glued them together to a plaster model of a fetal skull we found, and put together something that worked wonderfully".<ref name="m79"/>

The main antagonist of "Terms of Endearment", Weinsider is a child-murdering demon.<ref name="avclub"/> However, the episode plays against genre archetypes by turning Weinsider into a sympathetic villain.<ref name="messy2"/><ref name="sixth"/> Critics have pointed out that the character's presentation was not entirely negative.<ref name="sixth"/> Some have commented that Campbell humanized the character, portraying him in a manner that adds likability to a character who could have been more sinister.<ref name="avclub"/><ref name="sixth"/> By the time Weinsider is defeated, the audience is led to partially identify with him.<ref name="avclub"/> He ultimately sacrifices himself for the sake of the greater good, showcasing heroic qualities and subverting the way that villains are often portrayed in the genre.<ref name="messy2"/>

Upon its first broadcast, the episode received mixed reviews from critics.

In the years following "Terms of Endearment"'s original broadcast, critical reception improved. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book ''Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen'', gave three stars out of five, describing it as "a very brave story".<ref name=shear/> Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode suffered from its attempt to balance comedy and horror, "not having enough comedy to explore the premise properly, and not enough suspense to provide much drama". However, both Persky and Campbell were praised for their acting, despite the perceived shallowness of the latter's character.<ref name=shear>[[#Shearman|Shearman and Pearson]], pp. 173<U+2013>174</ref> David Wharton of [[Cinema Blend]] called Campbell's performance "lowkey" and subtle, commenting that he portrayed Weinsider "a bit less madcap than many of the roles that he's known for".<ref name="BLEND"/> Wharton praised the casting, describing it as "against type", which he claimed worked well because the material of the episode was more serious and dramatic than usual for the series.<ref name=BLEND>{{cite web | author =Wharton, David |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/dvdnews/FlixWorthy-Celebrates-Ash-Wednesday-With-Best-Streaming-Bruce-Campbell-30581.html |title=FlixWorthy Celebrates Ash Wednesday With The Best Of Streaming Bruce Campbell |work=[[Cinema Blend]]|publisher=Joshua Tyler |date=9 March 2011 |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>

"Terms of Endearment" was the first entry of the series written by Amann, who beforehand had unsuccessfully pitched several ideas for the show.<ref name="plot"/> Based on the success of this episode, Amann went on to write several more episodes for the series, such as "[[Agua Mala]]" later in the same season.<ref name="plot"/> During the [[The X-Files (season 9)|ninth season]], Amann became one of the main supervising producers and had writing involvement in several episodes, most notably "[[Release (The X-Files)|Release]]" and "[[Hellbound (The X-Files)|Hellbound]]".<ref name="plot"/><ref>{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] et al. |year=2002 |title=The Truth Behind Season 9: "The Truth" |medium= DVD |location = ''[[The X-Files (season 9)|The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season]]''|publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>

Chris Owens, who portrayed Jeffrey Spender on the show, was negatively affected by the episode.<ref>[[#Meisler|Meisler (2000)]], p. 284</ref><ref name="Spender"/> Following the premiere of "Terms of Endearment", he received "strange reactions" from people on the street who were displeased with his character.<ref name="Spender">[[#Meisler|Meisler (2000)]], p. 150</ref> In the series, the character staunchly disbelieves in the paranormal, and tries to remove the initial report about child-abducting demons in the episode, only for it to be salvaged by Mulder and Scully.<ref name="plot"/> People were so annoyed by the nature of the character that Owens would be pestered during his everyday life; during one incident, a person angrily called him a "paper shredder".<ref name="Spender"/>
