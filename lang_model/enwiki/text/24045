In [[genetic epidemiology]], a '''genome-wide association study''' (GWA study, or GWAS), also known as '''whole genome association study''' (WGA study, or WGAS), is an examination of many common [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|genetic variants]] in different individuals to see if any variant is associated with a trait. Typically [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) are investigated and typically investigated traits include major diseases. The first GWA study was from 2005 and compared 96 patients with [[age-related macular degeneration]] with 50 healthy controls<ref name="pmid15761122">{{cite journal | author = Klein RJ | title = Complement Factor H Polymorphism in Age-Related Macular Degeneration | journal = Science | volume = 308 | pages = 385<U+2013>9 | year = 2005 | month = March | pmid = 15761122 | doi=10.1126/science.1109557 | pmc=1512523 | issue = 5720 | last2 = Zeiss | first2 = C | last3 = Chew | first3 = EY | last4 = Tsai | first4 = JY | last5 = Sackler | first5 = RS | last6 = Haynes | first6 = C | last7 = Henning | first7 = AK | last8 = Sangiovanni | first8 = JP | last9 = Mane | first9 = SM}}</ref>.

These studies normally compare the DNA of two groups of participants: people with the disease (cases) and similar people without (controls). Each person gives a sample of cells, such as swabs of cells from the inside of the cheek. DNA is extracted from these cells, and spread on [[SNP array|genotyping microarrays]], which can read millions of DNA sequences. The results are then read into computers, where they can be analyzed. Rather than reading the entire DNA sequence, these systems usually read [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] that are variations in single nucleotides. If genetic variations are more frequent in people with the disease, the variations are said to be "associated" with the disease. The associated genetic variations are then considered as pointers to the region of the human genome where the disease-causing problem is likely to reside. In contrast to methods which specifically test one or a few genetic regions, the GWA studies investigates the entire genome. The approach is therefore said to be non-candidate-driven in contrast to gene-specific candidate-driven studies.

Surprisingly, most of the SNP variations associated with disease are not in the region of DNA that codes for a protein. Instead, they are usually in the large non-coding regions on the chromosome between genes, or in the [[intron]] sequences that are edited out of the DNA sequence when proteins are processed. These are presumably sequences of DNA that control splicing or expression of genes.

==Background==

Any two [[human genome]]s differ in millions of different ways.  There are small variations in the individual nucleotides of the genomes ([[Single-nucleotide polymorphism |SNPs]]) as well as many larger variations;  [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]], [[Insertion (genetics)|insertions]] and [[copy number variation| copy number variations]]. Any of these may cause alterations in an individual<U+2019>s [[phenotype]], which can be anything from disease risk to physical traits such as height<ref name="Strachan"> {{cite book | last1 = Strachan | first1 = Tom | last2 = Read | first2 = Andrew | title = Human Molecular Genetics | edition = 4 | publisher = Garland Science | pages = 467<U+2013>495 | accessdate = 2011-12-06 | isbn = 978-0-815-34149-9}}</ref>. Around 2000, prior to the introduction of GWA studies, the primary method of investigation was through inheritance studies in families. This approach had proven highly useful towards [[Genetic disorder#Single gene disorder|single gene disorders]]<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.omim.org | title = Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man | accessdate = 2011-12-06}}</ref>. However, for common and complex diseases the results of [[genetic linkage]] studies proved hard to reproduce<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 11565063 | year = 2001 | last1 = Altm<U+00FC>ller | first1 = J | last2 = Palmer | first2 = LJ | last3 = Fischer | first3 = G | last4 = Scherb | first4 = H | last5 = Wjst | first5 = M | title = Genomewide Scans of Complex Human Diseases: True Linkage Is Hard to Find | volume = 69 | issue = 5 | pages = 936<U+2013>50 | doi = 10.1086/324069 | pmc = 1274370 | journal = American journal of human genetics | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}} }}</ref><ref name="Strachan" />. A suggested alternative to linkage studies was the [[genetic association]] study. This study type asks if the [[allele]] of a [[genetic variant]] is found more often than expected in individuals with the phenotype of interest (e.g. with the disease being studied). Early calculations on statistical power indicated that this approach could be better than linkage studies at detecting weak genetic effects<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 8801636 | year = 1996 | last1 = Risch | first1 = N | last2 = Merikangas | first2 = K | title = The future of genetic studies of complex human diseases | volume = 273 | issue = 5281 | pages = 1516<U+2013>7 | journal = Science | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}} | doi = 10.1126/science.273.5281.1516}}</ref>.

In addition to the conceptual framework, two other enabling factors made GWA studies possible. Firstly, the [[International HapMap Project]] from 2003 had identified a majority of the common SNPs which are interrogated in a GWA study<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 14685227 | year = 2003 | last1 = International Hapmap | first1 = Consortium | title = The International HapMap Project | volume = 426 | issue = 6968 | pages = 789<U+2013>96 | doi = 10.1038/nature02168 | journal = Nature | last2 = Gibbs | first2 = Richard A. | last3 = Belmont | first3 = John W. | last4 = Hardenbol | first4 = Paul | last5 = Willis | first5 = Thomas D. | last6 = Yu | first6 = Fuli | last7 = Yang | first7 = Huanming | last8 = Ch'Ang | first8 = Lan-Yang | last9 = Huang | first9 = Wei | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>. The [[Haplotype | haploblock structure]] identified by HapMap project also allowed the focus on the subset of SNPs that would describe most of the variation. Secondly the development of the methods to genotype all these SNPs using [[SNP array|genotyping arrays]] was an important prerequisite.

==Methods==

The most common approach of GWA studies is the [[Case-control study|case-control]] setup which compares two large groups of individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are then genotyped for the majority of common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the study, but typically around a million. For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the [[allele frequency]] is significantly altered between the case and the control group<ref name="Pmid">{{Cite journal | pmid = 21293453 | year = 2011 | last1 = Clarke | first1 = GM | last2 = Anderson | first2 = CA | last3 = Pettersson | first3 = FH | last4 = Cardon | first4 = LR | last5 = Morris | first5 = AP | last6 = Zondervan | first6 = KT | title = Basic statistical analysis in genetic case-control studies | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 121<U+2013>33 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2010.182 | pmc = 3154648 | journal = Nature protocols | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>. In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting effect sizes is the [[odds ratio]]. The odds ratio reports the ratio between two proportions, which in the context of GWA studies are the proportion of individuals in the case group having a specific allele, and the proportions of individuals in the control group having the same allele. When the allele frequency in the case group is much higher than in the control group, the odds ratio will be higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a [[P-value]] for the significance of the odds ratio is typically calculated using a simple [[Chi-squared test | chi-squared test]]. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease<ref name="Pmid" />.

There are several variations to this case-control approach.  A common alternative to case-controls GWA studies is the analysis of quantitative phenotypic data, e.g. height or biomarker concentrations or even [[Expression quantitative trait loci|gene expression]]. Likewise, alternative statistics designed for [[Dominance (genetics)|dominance]] or [[recessive]] penetrance patterns can be used<ref name="Pmid" />. Calculations are typically done using bioinformatics software such as PLINK, which also includes support for many of these alternative statistics<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 17701901 | year = 2007 | last1 = Purcell | first1 = S | last2 = Neale | first2 = B | last3 = Todd-Brown | first3 = K | last4 = Thomas | first4 = L | last5 = Ferreira | first5 = MA | last6 = Bender | first6 = D | last7 = Maller | first7 = J | last8 = Sklar | first8 = P | last9 = De Bakker | first9 = PI | title = PLINK: A Tool Set for Whole-Genome Association and Population-Based Linkage Analyses | volume = 81 | issue = 3 | pages = 559<U+2013>75 | doi = 10.1086/519795 | pmc = 1950838 | journal = American journal of human genetics | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>.

In addition to the calculation of association, it is common to take several variables into account that could potentially confound the results. Sex and age are common examples of this. In addition it is known that many genetic variations are associated with the geographical and historical populations in which the mutations first arose<ref>{{cite pmid|18758442}}</ref>. However, because of this, studies must take account of the geographical and ethnical background of participants, controlling for what is called [[population stratification]].

After odds ratios and P-values have been calculated for all SNPs, a common approach is to create a [[manhattan plot]] (see figure 1). In the context of GWA studies, this plot shows the negative logarithm of the P-value as a function of genomic location. Thus the SNPs with the most significant association will stand out on the plot, usually as stacks of points because of [[Haplotype |haploblock structure]]. Importantly, the P-value threshold for significance are corrected for [[multiple comparisons | multiple testing]] issues. The exact threshold vary by study, but typically P-values must be very low (10 to the power of -7 or -8) to be considered significant in the face of the millions of tested SNPs. In addition modern GWA studies typically utilize a setup of having discovery cohort, followed by validation of the most significant SNPs in validation cohort<ref name="Pmid" />.

==Results==

Attemps have been made at creating comprehensive catalogues of SNPs that have been identified from GWA studies<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 19474294 | year = 2009 | last1 = Hindorff | first1 = LA | last2 = Sethupathy | first2 = P | last3 = Junkins | first3 = HA | last4 = Ramos | first4 = EM | last5 = Mehta | first5 = JP | last6 = Collins | first6 = FS | last7 = Manolio | first7 = TA | title = Potential etiologic and functional implications of genome-wide association loci for human diseases and traits | volume = 106 | issue = 23 | pages = 9362<U+2013>7 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0903103106 | pmc = 2687147 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>. In light of the rapid advances in the field, however, more updated resources might be found in recent initiatives aimed at compiling databases through wiki-style approaches<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.wikigwa.org/ | title = wikiGWA | accessdate = 2011-12-07}}</ref>. At any rate, SNPs associated with diseases are currently numbered in the thousands.

Of particular interest is the first GWA study from 2005, which identified two SNPs associated with [[age-related macular degeneration]] (ARMD). These SNPs were located in the gene encoding [[complement factor H]], which was an unexpected finding in the research of ARMD. The findings from these first GWA studies have subsequently prompted further functional research towards therapeutical manipulation of the complement system in ARMD<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 21860027 | year = 2011 | last1 = Fridkis-Hareli | first1 = M | last2 = Storek | first2 = M | last3 = Mazsaroff | first3 = I | last4 = Risitano | first4 = AM | last5 = Lundberg | first5 = AS | last6 = Horvath | first6 = CJ | last7 = Holers | first7 = VM | title = Design and development of TT30, a novel C3d-targeted C3/C5 convertase inhibitor for treatment of human complement alternative pathway<U+2013>mediated diseases | volume = 118 | issue = 17 | pages = 4705<U+2013>13 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2011-06-359646 | pmc = 3208285 | journal = Blood | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>. Another landmark publication in the history of GWA studies was the 2007 Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium study of 14,000 cases of seven common diseases and 3,000 shared controls. This was the to date largest GWA study providing investigations of  [[coronary heart disease]], [[diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]], [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[bipolar disorder]], and [[hypertension]]. This study was successful in uncovering many new disease genes underlying these diseases.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.wtccc.org.uk/info/070606.shtml |title=Largest ever study of genetics of common diseases published today |publisher=Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium |date=2007-06-06 |accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref><ref name=WTCCC>{{cite journal |journal=Nature |volume=447 |issue=7145 |pages=661<U+2013>78 |year=2007 |author=Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium |title=Genome-wide association study of 14,000 cases of seven common diseases and 3,000 shared controls |pmid=17554300 |doi=10.1038/nature05911 |pmc=2719288 }}</ref>

Since these first landmark GWA studies, there has been two general trends. One has been towards larger and larger sample sizes. At the end of 2011 the largest sample sizes were up in the range of 200 000 individuals<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 21909115 | year = 2011 | author1 = International Consortium for Blood Pressure Genome-Wide Association Studies | last2 = Ehret | first2 = GB | last3 = Munroe | first3 = PB | last4 = Rice | first4 = KM | last5 = Bochud | first5 = M | last6 = Johnson | first6 = AD | last7 = Chasman | first7 = DI | last8 = Smith | first8 = AV | last9 = Tobin | first9 = MD | title = Genetic variants in novel pathways influence blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk | volume = 478 | issue = 7367 | pages = 103<U+2013>9 | doi = 10.1038/nature10405 | journal = Nature | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>. The reason is the drive towards reliably detecting risk-SNPs that have smaller [[odds ratios]] and lower allele frequency. Another trend has been towards the use of more narrowly defined phenotypes, such as [[blood lipids]],[[proinsulin]] or similar biomarkers<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 19060906 | year = 2009 | last1 = Kathiresan | first1 = S | last2 = Willer | first2 = CJ | last3 = Peloso | first3 = GM | last4 = Demissie | first4 = S | last5 = Musunuru | first5 = K | last6 = Schadt | first6 = EE | last7 = Kaplan | first7 = L | last8 = Bennett | first8 = D | last9 = Li | first9 = Y | title = Common variants at 30 loci contribute to polygenic dyslipidemia | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 56<U+2013>65 | doi = 10.1038/ng.291 | pmc = 2881676 | journal = Nature genetics | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>. These are termed intermediate phenotypes and their analysis are suggested to be of value to functional research into biomarkers<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 19901186 | year = 2009 | last1 = Danesh | first1 = J | last2 = Pepys | first2 = MB | title = C-reactive protein and coronary disease: Is there a causal link? | volume = 120 | issue = 21 | pages = 2036<U+2013>9 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.907212 | journal = Circulation | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>.

A central point of debate on GWA studies has been that most of the SNP variations found by GWA studies are associated with only a small increased risk of the disease, and have only a small predictive value. The median odds ratio is 1.33 per risk-SNP, with only a few showing odds ratios above 3.0<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 20300123 | year = 2010 | last1 = Ku | first1 = CS | last2 = Loy | first2 = EY | last3 = Pawitan | first3 = Y | last4 = Chia | first4 = KS | title = The pursuit of genome-wide association studies: Where are we now? | volume = 55 | issue = 4 | pages = 195<U+2013>206 | doi = 10.1038/jhg.2010.19 | journal = Journal of human genetics | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 20647212 | year = 2010 | last1 = Manolio | first1 = TA | title = Genomewide association studies and assessment of the risk of disease | volume = 363 | issue = 2 | pages = 166<U+2013>76 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra0905980 | journal = The New England journal of medicine | last2 = Guttmacher | first2 = Alan E. | last3 = Manolio | first3 = Teri A. | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>. These magnitudes are considered small because they do not explain much of the heritable variation. This variation is known from [[heritability]] studies based on [[monozygotic]] twins<ref name="Pmid_a">{{Cite journal | pmid = 18987709 | year = 2008 | last1 = Maher | first1 = B | title = Personal genomes: The case of the missing heritability | volume = 456 | issue = 7218 | pages = 18<U+2013>21 | doi = 10.1038/456018a | journal = Nature | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>. For example it is known that 80-90% of height is heritable. This means that if 29 cm separates the tallest 5% from the shortest 5% of the population, then genetics account for 27 cm. Of these 27 cm, however, the GWA studies only account for a minority. In the height example it is 6 cm, and for most other major complex phenotypes it is a similar small fraction<ref name="Pmid_a" />.

==Clinical applications==

One of the challenges for a successful GWAS in the future will be to apply the findings in a way that accelerates drug and diagnostics development, including better integration of genetic studies into the drug-development process and a focus on the role of genetic variation in maintaining health as a blueprint for designing new [[pharmaceutical drug|drugs]] and [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostics]]<ref>{{cite journal |title=Genomics: Hepatitis C virus gets personal |author=Iadonato SP & Katze MG |journal=Nature |year=2009 |volume=461 |pages=357<U+2013>8 |pmid=19759611 |doi=10.1038/461357a |issue=7262}}</ref>. Several studies have looked into the use of risk-SNP markers as a means of directly improving the accuracy of [[prognosis]]. Some have found that the accuracy of prognosis improves<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid=20837927 | year=2010 | last1=Muehlschlegel | first1=JD | last2=Liu | first2=KY | last3=Perry | first3=TE | last4=Fox | first4=AA | last5=Collard | first5=CD | last6=Shernan | first6=SK | last7=Body | first7=SC | last8=Cabg Genomics | first8=Investigators | title=Chromosome 9p21 Variant Predicts Mortality after CABG Surgery | volume=122 | issue=11 Suppl | pages=S60<U+2013>5 | doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.924233 | pmc=2943860 | journal=Circulation | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>, while others report only minor benefits from this use<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid =20159871 | year =2010 | last1 =Paynter | first1 =NP | last2 =Chasman | first2 =DI | last3 =Par<U+00E9> | first3 =G | last4 =Buring | first4 =JE | last5 =Cook | first5 =NR | last6 =Miletich | first6 =JP | last7 =Ridker | first7 =PM | title =Association between a Literature-Based Genetic Risk Score and Cardiovascular Events in 19,313 Women | volume =303 | issue =7 | pages =631<U+2013>7 | doi =10.1001/jama.2010.119 | pmc =2845522 | journal =JAMA : the journal of the American Medical Association | postscript =<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>. Generally, a problem with this direct approach is the small magnitudes of the effects observed. A small effect ultimately translates into a poor separation of cases and controls and thus only a small improvement of prognosis accuracy. An alternative application is therefore the potential for GWA studies to elucidate [[pathophysiology]]<ref>{{Citation | pmid = 20522751</ref>.

One of such successes is related to identifying the genetic variant associating with response to anti-hepatitis C virus treatment. For genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with [[Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a]] or [[Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b]] combined with [[ribavirin]], a GWAS study<ref>{{cite journal |title=Genetic variation in IL28B predicts hepatitis C treatment-induced viral clearance |author=Ge D, Fellay J, Thompson AJ, ''et al.'' |journal=Nature |year=2009 |volume=461 |pages=399<U+2013>401 |pmid=19684573 |doi=10.1038/nature08309 |issue=7262}}</ref> has shown that SNPs near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences in response to the treatment. A later report demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus<ref>{{cite journal |title=Genetic variation in IL28B and spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus |author=Thomas DL, Thio CL, Martin MP, ''et al.'' |journal=Nature |year=2009 |pmid=19759533 |doi=10.1038/nature08463 |volume=461 |issue=7265 |pages=798<U+2013>801 |pmc=3172006}}</ref>.

The goal of elucidating pathophysiology has also led to increased interest in the association between risk-SNPs and the [[gene expression]] of nearby genes, the so-called [[Expression quantitative trait loci |eQTL]] studies<ref>{{Citation | pmid = 20562444}}</ref>. The reason is that moving from risk-SNPs to risk-genes is one step closer towards actionable drug targets. As a result, major GWA studies of 2011 typically included this type of analysis<ref>{{Citation | pmid = 22055160}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | pmid =21378988}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | pmid =22100073}}</ref>. A success that follows from this type of analysis is the elucidation of the mechanisms of the risk-SNP in the SORT1 locus. Mechanistic follow-up studies of this locus using [[small interfering RNA]] and [[Knockout mouse |gene knock-out mice]] have shed light on the metabolism of [[low-density lipoprotein]], which have important clinical implications for [[cardiovascular disease]]<ref>{{Citation | pmid =21462369}}</ref>.

==Limitations==
GWA studies have several issues and limitations that can be taken care of through proper quality control and study setup. Lack of well defined case and control groups, sufficient sample size, control for [[multiple comparisons | multiple testing]] and control for population stratification are common problems<ref name="Pmid_b">{{Citation | pmid =18349094}}</ref>.  To this end it has been noted "the GWA approach can be problematic because the massive number of statistical tests performed presents an unprecedented potential for [[false-positive]] results"<ref name="Pmid_b" />. Although these issues can be taken care of, it does not always happen. This has been cited as contributing to a general sense of problems with the GWA methodology<ref>{{Citation | title = Size matters, and other lessons from medical genetics | url = www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/11/size-matters-and-other-lessons-from-medical-genetics.php| journal = Genomes Unzipped | last1 = Pickrell | first1 =  Joe | last2 =  Barrett | first2 =  Jeff | last3 =  MacArthur | first3 =  Daniel | last4 =  Jostins | first4 =  Luke | accessdate = 2011-12-07}</ref>. In addition to easily correctible problems as these, some more subtle but important issues have surfaced. A high profile GWA study investigating individuals with very long life spans in order to identify longevity SNPs has been mentioned as an example of this<ref>{{Citation | pmid =20595579}}</ref>. The publication came under scrutiny because of a disrepancy between the type of [[SNP array|genotyping array]] in the case and control group, which caused several SNPs to be falsely highlighted as associated to longevity<ref name=MacArthur>{{Citation | title =   Serious flaws revealed in "longevity genes" study | url = http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/07/serious-flaws-revealed-in-longevity-genes-study/ | author = MacArthur, Daniel | journal = Wired | accessdate = 2011-12-07}}</ref>. The study was subsequently [[Retraction|retracted]]<ref>{{Citation | pmid =21778381}}</ref>.

In addition to these preventable issues, GWA studies have attracted more fundamental types of critique. GWA studies are necessarily broad in scope: that is they search the entire genome for associations rather than focusing on small candidate areas. This aspect of GWA has attracted the criticism as expensive "factory science". Furthermore, it has lead to comments that although it could not have been known prospectively, GWA was ultimately not worth the expenditure<ref>{{Citation | pmid = 20522751}}</ref>. Alternative strategies suggested involves [[linkage analysis]], as explained in the background section. More recently, the rapidly decreasing price of complete genome [[sequencing]] have also provided a realistic alternative to [[SNP array|genotyping array]]-based GWA studies. It can be discussed if the use of this new technique will still be referred to as a GWA study, but high-throughput sequencing does have potential to side-step some of the short-comings of non-sequencing GWA<ref>{{Citation | pmid = 21670730}}</ref>.
