'''William Monahan''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>w<U+026A>lj<U+0259>m <U+02C8>m<U+0252>n<U+0259>h<U+00E6>n}})<ref>{{cite web | url = http://inogolo.com/pronunciation/d801/William_Monahan | title = Pronunciation of William Monahan | accessdate = 2007-05-03 | publisher = inogolo.com}}</ref> (born November 3, 1960) is an [[Academy Award]]-winning [[United States|American]] [[screenwriter]], novelist, and former journalist. Before his screen-writing career he worked as a short story writer, essayist and critic for publications in and around New York city, among them the ''[[New York Press]]'', ''[[The New York Post]]'', ''[[Talk (magazine)|Talk]]'', and ''[[Bookforum]]''. He won a 1997 [[Pushcart Prize]] for one of his short stories. His 2000 novel ''[[Light House: A Trifle]]'', earned critical praise and led to Monahan's move into film after [[Warner Brothers]] bought the film rights and commissioned Monahan to adapt it for the screen.

His first produced screenplay,  ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'', was made into a film by [[Ridley Scott]] and released to theaters in 2005. His second produced screenplay was ''[[The Departed]]'', a film that earned him a [[Writers Guild of America|WGA award]] and an Academy Award for [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. 

In 2006, he started his own company, Henceforth, and negotiated a [[first look deal|"first-look" producing deal]] with Warner Bros. Monahan resides in the United States with his wife and two children.<ref name=BostonGlobe1/>

Monahan spent a year moving boxes at a liquor store before he began attending classes at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|University of Massachusetts, Amherst]]. While there, he studied [[English literature#Elizabethan Literature|Elizabethan]] and [[English literature#Jacobean Literature|Jacobean drama]].<ref name=WrittenBy>{{cite news |title=Profane Eloquence: Through the words of William Monahan, Boston swagger meets Hong Kong crime drama |author=John Koch |year=2007 |month=February/March |work=Written By |publisher=The Writers Guild of America, West |url=http://www.wga.org/writtenby/writtenbysub.aspx?id=2312 |accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref> He says he choose the university mainly for its esteemed scholars like [[Normand Berlin]].<ref name=BostonGlobe1/> While there, he began publishing fiction in local [[zine]]s and [[small press]]es.

When [[Kurt Vonnegut Jr.|Kurt Vonnegut]] spoke at UMass-Amherst Monahan attended the event as a writer for ''Old Crow Review'' and asked a few questions of Vonnegut; he later published an account of Vonnegut's visit in the ''New York Press''.<ref>William Monahan. "And Slow It Goes: Portrait of Kurt Vonnegut as Hot Fudge Sundae", ''[[New York Press]]'', vol. 7, no. 23 (June 8-14, 1994)</ref>. On another occasion, he entered into a short-lived business to make books with a woman he met after crashing his motorcycle in front of her car. They decided to print 100 paperback copies of a novella he had written. Before any copies were sold, Monahan reconsidered the undertaking and bought out his partner, burning "all the copies but one".<ref>William Monahan. "Holiday Gift Guide: The Seven Pillars of Christmas", ''New York Press'', vol. 7, no. 48 (November 30-December 6, 1994).</ref>

===Writer===

In 1993, Monahan began contributing essays and short fiction to the [[alternative weekly]] ''[[New York Press]]'', where editorial control was unusually permissive compared with most papers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Jim Knipfel: A Swell Looking Babe |author=Brian Berger |date=2007-12-12 |publisher=WhoWalkInBrooklyn.com |url=http://www.whowalkinbrooklyn.com/?p=512 |quote=<U+2026> it was inspiring to see such a diverse, ''weird'' group of writers successfully published. |accessdate=2008-08-15 }}</ref> He wrote a cover story titled "Ceci n'est pas une bombe", in which he theorized that the [[Unabomber]] was communicating through a hidden code involving Old English.<ref name=Unabomber>{{cite book |title=Harvard and the Unabomber: The Education of an American Terrorist |author=Alston Chase |year=2003 |month=March |publisher=W.

Throughout the summer season of 1995, Monahan wrote a weekly column for the seasonal ''[[Hamptons Magazine|Hamptons]]'' a publication that covers [[The Hamptons]] summer colony. He was named an editor of the magazine for the summer of 1996 but he quit after 3 issues, writing that the environment there was "ridiculously unworkable."<ref name=Burningdeck>William Monahan.

In the mid-1990s, Monahan resided in New York City, earning a living doing freelance work for the ''New York Press'', and gradually for several other publications: he reviewed books for ''[[The New York Post]]'' and once wrote for men's magazine [[Maxim (magazine)|''Maxim'']].<ref>{{cite news |title=Required Reading |author=William Georgiades |date=[[2007-02-25]] |work=[[The New York Post]] |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/02252007/entertainment/required_reading_entertainment_william_georgiades.htm |accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Felix Dennis&nbsp;<U+2014> owner of Dennis Publishing forwards Maxim magazine |author=Tony Silber |date=[[1999-04-15]] |publisher=''Folio: The Magazine for Magazine Management'' reprinted by FindArticles.com |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3065/is_5_28/ai_54471794 |accessdate=2007-11-10}}</ref> Before long, he won recognition for his short fiction. He was awarded a 1997 [[Pushcart Prize]] for his short story, "A Relation of Various Accidents Observable in Some Animals Included in Vacuo", following a nomination by ''[[Old Crow Review]]'';<ref name=Pushcart/> and, in the following year's ''Pushcart'' volume, his ''Perkins Press'' short story "At the Village Hall", another nomination by ''Old Crow Review'', garnered a special mention.<ref>{{ cite book |title=''The Pushcart Prize XXII: Best of the Small Presses''|editor=Bill Henderson |publisher=[[Pushcart Press]] |year=1997 |month=December |chapter=Special Mention |isbn=978-1888889017 |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=BMhZAAAAMAAJ&pgis=1 |page=609 }}</ref><ref name=Pushcart>{{cite book |title=The Pushcart Prize XXI: Best of the Small Presses (1997) |editor=Bill Henderson |author=William Monahan |publisher=Pushcart Press |year=1996 |month=December |chapter=A Relation of Various Accidents Observable in Some Animals Included in Vacuo |isbn=978-1888889000 }}</ref>

In 1997, Monahan was hired to work as an editor at [[Spy (magazine)|''Spy'']] magazine, a satirical monthly, by the editor-in-chief [[Bruno Maddox]]. He later reminisced, in an interview with ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', that he "had God's own job there". In 1998, ''Spy'' magazine was shutdown; he had worked on the last four issues as a rewrite man and editor.<ref name=BostonGlobe1>{{cite news|title= Standing at the corner of Shakespeare and Scorsese |author=Sam Allis| date=[[2006-10-03]] |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2006/10/03/standing_at_the_corner_of_shakespeare_and_scorcese/ | accessdate=2007-01-01 }}</ref>

In late 2001, Monahan wrote a comic [[Serial (literature)|serial narrative]] for the ''New York Press'' titled ''[[Dining Late with Claude La Badarian]]'', published over thirteen weeks under the pseudonym Claude La Badarian, a fictional restaurant critic.

===''Tripoli''===
In 1990, Monahan wrote a script titled ''Tripoli'', about [[William Eaton (soldier)|William Eaton's]] epic march on Tripoli during the [[Barbary Wars]], registering it with the WGA with the alternate title of "Captain Eaton", and later set out the opening of ''Tripoli'' in prose form under the title of "Romantic" in 1997, published in ''Old Crow Review''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=William Monahan |title=Romantic |journal=Old Crow Review |issue=8 |pages=16 pages|publisher=FkB Press |month=December | year=1997}}</ref>  While working at ''Spy'' magazine, Monahan routinely spent two weeks working in Manhattan followed by two weeks writing his own material in Massachusetts; during this period he took the ''Tripoli'' script out of a drawer and placed it with an agent.<ref name=LATimes/> In 2001, shortly after he got married, ''Tripoli'' sold to [[20th Century Fox]], in a deal worth mid-six figures in American dollars with Mark Gordon attached as the producer.<ref name=Tripoli>{{cite news| title=Monahan 'Tripoli' spec lands on Gordon's shore |date=[[2001-11-27]]| author=Cathy Dunkley, Jonathan Bing |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117856400.html |accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref>  The historical epic follows Eaton's campaign against [[Yusuf Karamanli|Yusuf Bashaw]] to restore Yusuf's brother, the exiled heir Hamet Karamanli, to the throne of the Barbary Coast nation of Tripoli, and features a French mercenary named Joubert.<ref>{{cite news |author=Stax |work=IGN |date=[[2003-08-07]] |title=The Stax Report: Script Review of Tripoli |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/432/432011p1.html |accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref> [[Ridley Scott]] signed to direct.

===Negotiating deals and production rewriting===

Before the start of production on ''Kingdom of Heaven'' in January 2004, Monahan was hired to write several scripts for big-budget films, beginning with ''[[Jurassic Park IV]]'' which he was hired to write for [[Universal Pictures]] as reported in 2002.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lizards leap again for U: 'Tripoli' scribe returning to 'Park' pen |author=Dana Harris |date=[[2002-11-06]] |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117875636.html |work=Variety |accessdate=2007-01-06}}</ref> [[Columbia Pictures]] then hired him to write a script based on a manuscript by journalist [[Doug Stanton]], later published as ''The Horse Soldiers: A True Story of Modern War'', which recounted the bloody uprising in the Afghan city [[Mazari Sharif]] following the American incursion against the Taliban. Subsequently, [[Brad Pitt]]'s production company Plan B hired him to adapt the [[Hong Kong action film]] ''[[Infernal Affairs]]'', which [[Martin Scorsese]] directed under the title ''[[The Departed]]'' for Warner Bros.; the film won Monahan two Best Adapted Screenplay awards, from the Writers Guild of America and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.<ref>{{cite news| title=Monahan eyes war script for Col: Busy writer has two tales for Scott, a 'Jurassic' sequel |author=Claude Brodesser |date=[[2003-03-16]] |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117882350.html |work=Variety |accessdate=2007-01-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Scorsese takes on Hong Kong gangs: Pitt considering role in popular 'Infernal' redo |author=Claude Brodesser, Cathy Dunkley |date=[[2004-02-12]] |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117900068.html |accessdate=2007-01-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Brad Pitt's role as filmmaker threatens to eclipse his actorly exploits and tabloid profile |author=Dade Hayes |date=[[2006-12-14]] |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117955806.html |accessdate=2007-03-03 }}</ref> [[John Sayles]] was later hired to write a subsequent draft for ''Jurassic Park IV'' when Monahan became indisposed: he had entered into a [[production write-through contract]] for ''Kingdom of Heaven'', requiring him to be on location to potentially modify its [[shooting script]].<ref name=PWTC>{{cite news |title=William Monahan Talks The Departed |author=Sasha Stone |date=[[2007-02-16]] |publisher=OscarWatch.com |url=http://www.oscarwatch.com/2007/02/william_monahan_talks_the_depa.html |accessdate=2007-02-26 }}</ref><ref name=BostonGlobe1/><ref name=USAToday_facts/><ref>{{cite news|title=Rewriting Jurassic Park IV: Silver City scribe tackles new dinosaur tale |author=Paul Davidson |date=[[2004-09-17]] |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/549/549150p1.html |work=IGN |accessdate=2007-01-06 }}</ref>

In the meantime, it was reported that Monahan had secured work on two Warner Bros. projects. He was hired to adapt [[Louis Begley]]'s novel ''[[Wartime Lies]]'' for [[Warner Independent Pictures]], previously in development as a Stanley Kubrick project called ''[[Stanley Kubrick#Aryan Papers|Aryan Papers]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title= WIP a 'Wartime' recruit: Warner catches WWII 'Lies' |author=Claude Brodesser |date=[[2005-05-10]] |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117922510.html |accessdate=2007-01-06}}</ref> A second script was to be based on [[Marco Polo]]'s autobiography ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Travels]]'', as a star vehicle for actor [[Matt Damon]], titled ''The Venetian'', and set during Polo's Far East explorations.<ref name=Polo>{{cite news |title=Warner Bros. plays 'Polo': Historical epic to feature Damon as explorer |author=Michael Fleming |date=[[2005-05-02]] |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117922038.html |work=Variety |accessdate=2007-01-06}}</ref><ref name=Henceforth/>

''Kingdom of Heaven'' was released theatrically in May 2005. Peter Canavese of ''Groucho Reviews'' described ''Kingdom'' as a "confusing compromise at best and a dull obfuscation of history at worst" and Jeffrey M. Anderson of ''Combustible Celluloid'' wrote that ''Kingdom'' "has at its center a bold story, and yet it sits there like a stone pillar".<ref>{{cite web |title=Kingdom of Heaven (2005) Review |author=Peter Canavese |work=Groucho Reviews |url=http://www.grouchoreviews.com/index.php?module=Movie_Reviews&func=display&id=2221 |accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Kingdom of Heaven (2005) Review |author=Jeffrey M.

Critics were pleased with the extended version of the film and [[James Berardinelli]] of ''ReelViews'' remarked how "now that the director's cut is available, there's no reason for anyone to watch the neutered theatrical edition".<ref>{{cite web |title=Kingdom of Heaven: Director's Cut: A Film Review |author=[[James Berardinelli]] |year=2006 |publisher=ReelViews.net |url=http://www.reelviews.net/movies/k/kingdom_heaven_directors.html |accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref>

While Monahan was on the set of ''The Departed'' his wife gave birth to a daughter. He was already a step-father to his wife's son.

When [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''The Departed'' was released to theaters in October 2006, Monahan received considerable praise from critics and was applauded for his depiction of the city of [[Boston]]. Monahan had chosen not to watch ''Infernal Affairs'' so that he could create an original interpretation of the [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action film]], and instead worked from an [[English language|English]] translation of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] script.<ref>{{cite news |title=Movie Review: The Departed |author=Beth Accomando |date=[[2006-10-06]] |publisher=KPBS.Org |url=http://www.kpbs.org/blogs/movies/2006/10/06/the-departed/ |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> He used his intimate knowledge of the way Bostonians talk and act, learned from his youth spent in the many [[Neighborhoods in Boston, Massachusetts|neighborhoods of Boston]], to create characters that ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' described as distinctly indigenous to the city.<ref>{{cite news |title=Oscar winners weigh in on victory: Backstage notes at the Academy Awards |author=David S.

===Taking on producing roles with intent to direct===

After winning the 2007 Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for ''The Departed'', it was announced that Monahan had been hired to work on two film projects: an adaptation of the [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong film]] ''[[Confession of Pain]]'' and an original Rock and Roll film titled ''The Long Play''. Monahan signed to both [[executive producer|executive produce]] and write the adaptation of ''Confession of Pain'' for Warner Bros. Pictures, later given the title ''Nothing in the World''; it would be his second adaptation of a [[Media Asia Entertainment Group|Media Asia Films]] production created by directors [[Andrew Lau]] and [[Siu Fai Mak|Alan Mak]] and screenwriter [[Felix Chong]].<ref name=AppianWay/><ref>{{cite press release |title=Media Asia's event film "Confession of Pain" |date=[[2006-07-10]] |publisher=Media Asia Entertainment Group Ltd. |url=http://www.mediaasia.com/eng/news_detail.php?Id=249 |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref><ref name=AppianWay>{{cite news |title=Monahan, DiCaprio reconnect |author=Borys Kit |date=[[2007-02-27]] |work=The Hollywood Reporter |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003550909 |accessdate=2007-03-02}}</ref><ref name=Nothing>{{cite news |title=Scribes list celebrates tenth edition: Variety marks occasion with alumni update |author=Variety staff |date=2008-06-18 |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117987715.html |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> Monahan's other commission was to rewrite a script about the history of the [[Rock and Roll|rock music]] business titled ''The Long Play'', whose first drafts were written by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer Rich Cohen who was commissioned in 1999 by [[Mick Jagger]] and Martin Scorsese, while subsequent drafts were written by Matthew Weiss.<ref>{{cite news |title=HBO gets 'Tough' with rock scribe Cohen |author=Jonathan Bing |date=[[2001-01-17]] |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117792079.html |accessdate=2007-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Matthew Weiss: Filmography |work=The New York Times |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=231945 |accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref><ref name=TheLongPlay>{{cite news |title=Scorsese, Monahan ready to 'Play': 'Departed' duo rock on at Paramount |author=Michael Fleming, Pamela McClintock |date=[[2007-02-26]] |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117960184.html |accessdate=2007-03-02}}</ref>

In 2007, the movie rights to [[Robert Graves]]' novel ''[[I, Claudius]]'', expired and consequently were brought back into the marketplace on behalf of the author's estate.<ref>{{cite news |title=Scott Rudin seizes 'I, Claudius': Producer nabs screen rights to Graves book |author=Michael Fleming |date=2007-09-05 |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117971367.html |accessdate=2007-01-15}}</ref> Monahan was briefly linked in the press with a new film project involving the book, but the project eventually passed to another writer.<ref>{{cite news |title=Relativity says aye, 'Claudius': Jim Sheridan to co-write, direct |author=Borys Kit |date=2008-09-12 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i6e1ea93903c4b3a3d377eba19b9ab13a |accessdate=2008-09-12 }}</ref>

In the weeks following the end of the [[2007<U+2013>2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], it was reported that Monahan had been hired by Warner Bros. to adapt the [[South Korea]]n action film ''[[South Korean films of 2008|The Chaser]]''. He shortly thereafter entered into a first look deal with GK films, the production company of [[Graham King]], a producer on ''The Departed'', who had hired Monahan in 2007 to write a feature film adaptation of the six-hour 1985 [[BBC]] mini-series ''[[Edge of Darkness]]''. As part of this deal, Monahan was enlisted to write a script about drug dealer Jim Keene, based on Hillel Levin's ''[[Playboy]]'' article, "The Strange Redemption of James Keene".<ref>{{cite news |title=All too quiet on the post-strike front |author=Steven Zeitchik and Borys Kit |date=2008-02-22 |work=Hollywood Reporter }}</ref> Monahan was also reported to have acquired, in conjunction with producer Quentin Curtis, the rights to [[Ken Bruen]]'s novel ''London Boulevard,'' which pays homage to [[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]. Monahan has written the screenplay and will direct the film.<ref>{{cite news |title='London Boulevard' by Ken Bruen |author=K.

==Writing process==
Monahan prefers that screenplays be written by one author and does not support the collaborative model in which multiple [[screenwriter]]s write competing drafts.<ref name=USAToday_facts/>  His interest in motion pictures began at an early age, but he admittedly steered clear of the [[film industry]] because he mistakenly surmised that the collaborative model was a de facto practice for creating screenplays.<ref name=WGAw/> However, in his mid 30s, he went to Hollywood to adapt his first novel into a film and later discovered that if you produce exceptional work, you can "stick to your own model of work, instead of caving in to industry expectations", however, he acknowledged that the writer does need to have the backing of a powerful [[film director]] who will protect his vision.<ref name=Verbinski/><ref name=WGAw/> Since then, he has generally been the sole writer on his screenplays, except for ''[[Jurassic Park IV]]'', which was taken over by [[John Sayles]] and rewritten when Monahan had to go on location for ''Kingdom of Heaven''.<ref name=USAToday_facts/> 

Monahan has quipped that, having studied [[English drama]] for over 30 years, he is "post-conscious about craft".<ref name=Frosty/>  When doing historical fiction he reads the available [[primary source]]s and will not look at a contemporary book.<ref name=Crusade/><ref>{{cite news |title=A burly war epic and a gay TV channel. Next year should be fun |author=Richard Corliss and Jeanne McDowell |date=[[2004-10-03]] |work=[[Time Magazine]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101041011/nextentertainment.html |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> He is critical of the instruction given by people running screenwriting courses,<ref name=Frosty/> and has said that "classes and books on screenwriting do far more harm than good, because writing drama is intuitional and case-by-case".<ref name=LATimes/> He has stated a couple of times that he believes there are no general rules to writing, and, in a Collider.com interview, he further elaborated that he has come to realize that "[e]ach work has its own inherent rules. You discover them. You don<U+2019>t import them."<ref name=LATimes/><ref name=Frosty/>

In his experience he has found that "when you<U+2019>re writing a character, you are that character", musing that "It<U+2019>s probably no joke that [[Shakespeare]] was an actor."<ref name=BlackBook>{{cite news |title=Fiction (With a Twist of Lennon) |author=William Monahan interviews [[David Thewlis]] |date=[[2007-10-15]] |publisher=''[[BlackBook Magazine|BlackBook]]'' magazine |url=http://www.blackbookmag.com/features/comments/fiction-with-a-twist-of-lennon1/ |accessdate=2007-10-20}}</ref>

Monahan has said that he would prefer to work on an old [[Olivetti|Olivetti Praxis]] typewriter in many instances because there are too many distractions on a modern [[computer]].<ref name=Frosty/>
