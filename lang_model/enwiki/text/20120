"'''Weight Gain 4000'''" is the second episode of the [[South Park (season 1)|first season]] of the animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on August 20, 1997. In the episode, the residents of South Park excitedly prepare for a visit by celebrity [[Kathie Lee Gifford]], whom schoolteacher [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] plans to assassinate because of a childhood grudge. In the meantime, fourth-grader [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] becomes explosively obese after buying Weight Gain 4000, a [[bodybuilding supplement]].

Written and directed by series co-founders [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], "Weight Gain 4000" was rated [[Television content rating systems#United States|TV-MA]] in the United States. After the ''South Park'' pilot episode "[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]" drew poor test audience results, Comedy Central requested a script for one more new episode before deciding whether to commit to a full series. The resulting script for "Weight Gain 4000" helped the network decide to pick up the show. It was also the first ''South Park'' episode created completely using computers rather than construction paper.

Although criticized by some for its profanity and other material deemed offensive at the time of its original broadcast, several reviewers felt the episode was a significant improvement over the pilot, particularly for its satirical element regarding American [[consumerism]]. The episode introduced such recurring characters as [[Jimbo Kern]], [[Mayor McDaniels]], [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Bebe Stevens|Bebe Stevens]] and [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Clyde Donovan|Clyde Donovan]]. The show's portrayal of Kathie Lee Gifford was the first time a celebrity was spoofed in ''South Park''. Cartman's line "Beefcake" became one of the most popular catchphrases from the series.

==Plot==
At the beginning of the episode, teacher [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] announces that fourth-grader [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] has won the South Park Elementary's "Save Our Fragile Planet" essay contest, much to the anger of his classmate [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]], who immediately suspects him of cheating. The rest of the town becomes a flurry of excitement upon learning celebrity television host [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] will come to South Park to present Cartman with an award on national television. [[List of other South Park residents#Mayor McDaniels|Mayor McDaniels]] plans a big event to showcase the town, with hopes of furthering her own career. She recruits cafeteria worker [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] to sing at the event, unaware Chef has plans to seduce Gifford through his song. Mr. Garrison directs rehearsals for a play with the schoolchildren depicting the history of South Park, which is to be shown at the event. Mayor McDaniels is horrified, however, to learn the historically accurate play includes children playing pioneers who attack and brutally beat the students portraying [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]].

Unbeknownst to the rest of town, Mr. Garrison relives a traumatic childhood memory in which a young Gifford defeated him in a national talent show. Mr. Garrison is manipulated by his hand puppet, [[Herbert Garrison#Mr. Hat|Mr. Hat]], to assassinate Gifford out of revenge. He purchases a large rifle from [[Jimbo Kern|Jimbo's]] gun shop and plots to shoot her from the window of a book depository. Meanwhile, Cartman is excited to appear on live television, and Mayor McDaniels instructs him to get into shape for Gifford's visit. Later, Cartman watches a television commercial for "Weight Gain 4000", a [[bodybuilding supplement]], and demands his mom buy it for him. Cartman becomes explosively fat from the product, although he is in excellent shape and the excess weight is strictly muscle. Back at the school, Wendy looks through Mr. Garrison's papers and confirms Cartman indeed cheated on the contest by writing his name on a copy of ''[[Walden]]'' by [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Wendy also uncovers Mr. Garrison's assassination plan, and enlists her friend [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s help to stop him.

Most of the town attends the celebratory event and Mr. Garrison takes his position in the book depository. As Gifford approaches, however, he is frustrated to see she is hidden behind a [[bulletproof glass]] bubble hitched to the top of a car. Wendy and Stan arrive and try unsuccessfully to stop him, but Mr. Garrison fires a shot and misses, hitting fourth-grader [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] in the head. Kenny is propelled through the air and impaled on a flagpole. Gifford's bodyguards whisk Gifford away, costing a disappointed Cartman his chance to be on television. Wendy takes to the stage and announces Cartman cheated on his essay, but the townspeople are too upset about Gifford's departure to care. Mr. Garrison is taken to a mental hospital, where Mr. Hat is placed into a straightjacket, while Cartman appears on ''[[Geraldo (TV series)|Geraldo]]'' because of his tremendous obesity, shouting, "Follow your dreams. You can reach your goals, I'm living proof&nbsp;... [[Beefcake]], BEEFCAKE!" The episode ends with Chef having sex with Gifford.

"Weight Gain 4000" was written and directed by series co-founders [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]]. It first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on August 20, 1997.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/102/ |title=Weight Gain 4000 - Episode Guide - South Park Studios |publisher=South Park Studios (Official)

</ref> The ''South Park'' pilot, "[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]", did not do well with test audiences, and Comedy Central executives were unsure whether they wanted to order any additional episodes. However, they paid Parker and Stone to write another script when [[Internet]] buzz began to generate about the duo and their work on "[[The Spirit of Christmas]]", the 1995 animated short film that served as a precursor to ''South Park''. The network opted not to commit to a full Comedy Central series until they could read the newly-commissioned script. The result was "Weight Gain 4000", which the two ''South Park'' creators wrote while they were working on their 1997 comedy-action film, ''[[Orgazmo]]''.<ref name="Commentary">{{cite video | people=Trey Parker, Matt Stone|year=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: "Weight Gain 4000"|format=Audio commentary |medium=CD||publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref>

In writing the script, the duo sought to give Comedy Central executives an idea of what the series would be like and how each show could differ from the others. Parker and Stone also said they would not write another  script until the network signed off on the full show with a season of at least six episodes. Comedy Central liked the script and agreed to commit to a series. While "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" was created almost entirely with construction paper, "Weight Gain 4000" was the first ''South Park'' episode made completely using computers.<ref name="Cartman Gets An Anal Probe">{{cite video | people=Trey Parker, Matt Stone|year=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe"|format=Audio commentary |medium=CD||publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref> It was created in little over a month in a studio in [[Westwood, California|Westwood]], [[California]], by about 15 animators using  [[PowerAnimator]], the [[Alias Systems Corporation]] animation program most commonly known as "Alias", which would be used in subsequent episodes. In the future, ''South Park'' shows would be created within a week of their broadcast dates and require about 40 animators. "Weight Gain 4000" was animated in chronological order from beginning to end. Although Parker and Stone sought to improve the details and textures of the characters and overall animation, they also specifically chose Alias because it would allow the animation to maintain the show's deliberately crude visual style they first created with construction paper in "The Spirit of Christmas" and "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe".<ref name="Commentary" />

The ''South Park'' creators and animators said they were still developing the characters and trying to figure out the future direction of the show with "Weight Gain 4000", which was more slow-paced than the series would eventually become. The 30-page script was shorter than in later episodes, which would average between 45 to 50 pages. The child protagonists also spoke slower. While recording their voice performances, the actors read the lines slowly and the dialogue was then sped up to create the characters' distinctive voices. At that time, Parker and Stone had not mastered the pace at which they needed to speak. The crowd shots in "Weight Gain 4000" took a particularly long time to animate due to the large amount of people featured, and the animators were especially proud of the use of depth and motion in the perspective of the [[reticle|crosshairs]] in Mr. Garrison's rifle scope as he tried to assassinate Kathie Lee Gifford.<ref name="Commentary" /> Mr. Garrison's hatred for Gifford was foreshadowed in "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", where the sentence "I'm not positive, but I think Cathy <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[sic]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> Lee Gifford is much older than she claims to be," can be seen on his classroom's chalkboard. During a flashback scene in "Weight Gain 4000", an eight-year-old Mr. Garrison is shown to already be bald on top with gray hair on the side of his ears. This led to an inconsistency in the first season episode "[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]", in which he has a full head of hair during a flashback.<ref name="EpGuide">{{cite book |title=The South Park Episode Guide: Volume 1, Seasons 1-5 |last=Stall |first=Sam |year=2009 |publisher=[[Running Press]] |location=[[New York City]], [[New York]] |isbn= 0762435615 |page=13}}</ref>

==Themes==
Describing the general tone of the show, Teri Fitsell of ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' explains that "South Park is a vicious social satire that works by spotlighting not the immorality of these kids but their amorality, and contrasting it with the conniving hypocrisy of the adults who surround them."<ref>{{Cite news |first=Teri |last=Fitsell |title=Not in front of the children... |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=1999=08-08}}</ref> The humor of the show comes from the disparity between the cute appearance of the characters and their crude behavior.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Rick |last=Martin |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/97938 |title="Peanuts" Gone Wrong |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=1997-07-21 |accessdate=2009-11-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |first=Brian |last=Lowry |url=http://articles.latimes.com/p/1997/aug/13/entertainment/ca-21873 |title=Out of the mouths of babes... |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1997-08-13 |accessdate=2009-11-22}}</ref> However, Parker and Stone said in an early interview that the show's language is realistic. "There are so many shows where little kids are good and sweet, and it's just not real&nbsp;... Don't people remember what they were like in third grade? We were little bastards."<ref>{{Cite news |first=Rob |last=Owen |title="South Park" is Sure to Make Parents Cringe |work=[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]]'' |date=1997-08-12}}</ref>

Although these elements were established in "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" and the ''Spirit of Christmas'' precursor cartoons, "Weight Gain 4000" further pushed the conventions of television, and especially of animated television entertainment. In addition to a continued stream of profanities and the promiscuous activities of Chef, an elementary school employee, the episode presents the character of Mr. Garrison as more and more unhinged. Although entrusted with the care of an elementary school class, Mr. Garrison demonstrates a questionable gender identity, poor teaching and unusual relationship with his Mr. Hat hand puppet.<ref name="Booker" />

"Weight Gain 4000" served as a commentary on American [[consumerism]], the equation of personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. This satire is particularly demonstrated by Cartman's blind faith in the Weight Gain 4000 bodybuilding supplement product despite strong evidence that the product fails in its primary function. Specifically, the product promises to build muscle, and Cartman believe it has fulfilled this function even after he only becomes extremely overweight.<ref name="Buff0803">{{Cite news|last=Simon|first=Jeff|title=Who's really the butt of all cable jokes?|work=[[The Buffalo News]]|date=1997-08-03|location=New York|page=2Tv}}</ref><ref name="SI0814">{{Cite news|last=Shales|first=Tom|author-link=Tom Shales|title=Cartoon "South Park" tries to go from crude to guilty pleasure|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1997-08-14|page=D8}}</ref> This blind faith is also illustrated by the complete disregard Cartman demonstrates for warnings that Weight Gain 4000 carries a risk of permanent damage to the liver and kidneys. The tremendous amount of product Cartman buys further indicative of American purchasing habits.<ref name="Buff0803" />

Cartman's impulse to buy a bodybuilding supplement based on a single commercial has been described as a satire of the concept of "identity shopping". The concept involves the obtaining of an identity through what one owns, wears or buys, just as Cartman seeks to remake himself as a bodybuilder by buying Weight Gain 4000.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Sitcom Reader: America Viewed and Skewed |last1=Dalton |first1=Mary M. |last2=Linder |first2=Laura R. |year=2005 |publisher=[[State University of New York Press]] |location=[[Albany, New York|Albany]], New York |isbn=0791465705 |page=194}}</ref> "Weight Gain 4000" also satirizes the obsession with celebrity prevalent among most Americans, particularly through the town's overly enthusiastic reaction to Kathie Lee Gifford's appearance.<ref name="SI0814" /> Additionally, [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] theologian Paul F. M. Zahl has suggested Cartman's addiction to food in the episode, combined with his blind faith in the Weight Gain 4000 supplement and his insistence to "Stay true to your dreams", reflects the idea that many people falsely cling to the notion of [[free will]] when they in fact lack any self-control whatsoever. Zahl wrote, "The two writers of ''South Park'' see through the myth of 'free will.'"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Grace in Practice |last=Zahl |first=Paul F.M. |year=2007 |publisher=[[William B.

==Cultural references and impact==
"Weight Gain 4000" introduced several characters who would maintain important recurring roles throughout the rest of the series. Among them were Jimbo Kern, Mayor McDaniels,<ref name="Commentary" /> and Wendy's best friend [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Bebe Stevens|Bebe Stevens]]. It also introduces [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Clyde Donovan|Clyde Donovan]], a student from Mr. Garrison's class who would eventually play significant roles in future seasons, although he was not identified by name.<ref name="EpGuide" /> The characters demonstrate the wide range of often-extreme personalities among the adult residents of ''South Park'', as well as serving as individual satires. McDaniels, who imagines herself an instant star upon being seen on television with Gifford, is portrayed as more caring about her own fame than the needs of her constituents,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Shales |first=Tom |author-link=Tom Shales |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=1997-08-13 |title="South Park" Falls Flatulent |page=C01}}</ref> and the neglect with which Jimbo sells a gun to an obviously unstable Mr. Garrison serves as a satire of [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]].<ref name="Commentary" /> Jimbo and his friend [[List of other South Park residents#Ned Gerblansky|Ned]] (who was not introduced until "[[Volcano (South Park)|Volcano]]") were inspired by caricatures Parker used to draw during high school. In creating McDaniels, Parker and Stone envisioned a sophisticated mayor who was convinced she was better than the other residents of South Park. The episode also marked the first reference of ''[[Jesus and Pals]]'', the public access television talk show hosted by [[Jesus (South Park)|Jesus Christ]]. The fictional show is mentioned twice in the background during commercials on television sets,<ref name="Commentary" /> although footage from the show itself is not shown until "[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]" later in the season.<ref name="EpGuide" /> ''Jesus and Pals'', and the idea of Jesus as a South Park resident, are references to the original "The Spirit of Christmas" cartoon. [[Debbie Liebling]], who served as a ''South Park'' producer at the time of the episode's broadcast, said the inclusion of a television show hosted by Jesus helped convey for audiences the idea of South Park as a place where "anything can happen".<ref>{{cite news|title=That's not all, folks|work=[[The Australian]]|author=Danielsen, Shane|page=14|date=1997-12-29}}</ref>

Kathie Lee Gifford, then a [[television host]]ess on the morning talk show ''[[Live with Regis and Kelly|Live with Regis and Kathie Lee]]'', was the first of many celebrities to be spoofed in a ''South Park'' episode.<ref name="WFP1119">{{Cite news|title=Politically incorrect comedy, heeeeerrre!|work=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|location=Canada|date=2006-11-19|page=D5}}</ref> The ''South Park'' creators said they chose Gifford completely at random, not based on any particular reason or distaste for her.

==Release and reception==
When "Weight Gain 4000" was released, many writers in the mainstream media were still debating the longevity and overall quality of ''South Park''. With the series still in its earliest stages, the episode continued to shock many with its frequent use of profanities by children and the apparent instability of school teacher Mr. Garrison.<ref name="Booker">{{cite book |title=Drawn to Television: Prime-Time Animation from The Flintstones to Family Guy |last=Booker |first=M.

Audiences were also shocked and offended by Chef's sexually suggestive song about Gifford.<ref name="Commentary" /> Nevertheless, several reviewers declared "Weight Gain 4000" a significant improvement over the pilot, "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", and felt it went in a much more satirical direction.<ref name="Buff0803" /><ref name="SI0814" />

Jeff Simon of ''[[The Buffalo News]]'', who did not like "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", felt "Weight Gain 4000" proved the series could be funny. He specifically complimented the episode's commentary on American consumerism.

"Weight Gain 4000" was released, alongside five other episodes, in a three-[[VHS]] set on May 5, 1998, marking the first time ''South Park'' was made available on video.
