==Hessen Cultural award controversy==

The German state of [[Hesse]] had planned to hand its 45.000 [[euro]] Hessen Cultural Prize in July 2009 jointly to a [[Jew]], a [[Muslim]], a [[Catholic]] and a [[Lutheran]] to honour the cultural achievements of the [[monotheistic religions]]. Navid Kermani was chosen as the Muslim awardee.  But Catholic Cardinal Karl Lehmann of Mainz, along with Peter Steinacker, former head of the Lutheran church of Hesse and Nassau, objected to sharing the state culture prize with him because Kermani had written an article about a [[crucifix]], a principal symbol of the [[Christian religion|Christian]] [[religion]], with, ''I'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with 'blasphemy and idolatry'.'' 

The prize board then wrote to Kermani withdrawing its offer of the prize to him, an action called "childish" by the [[Zentralrat der Muslime in Deutschland|Central Council of Muslims]].

Aiman A Mazyek, secretary of the council, explained to the Berlin newspaper [[Der Tagesspiegel]]: '"How would they have felt if a Muslim had refused to meet a churchman because he did not revere the Prophet Mohammed?"<ref>[http://www.islamtoday.com/showme2.cfm?cat_id=38&sub_cat_id=2215 Navid Kermani Denied Hessian Culture Award Due to Crucifix Comment]</ref><ref>[http://en.qantara.de/webcom/show_article.php/_c-478/_nr-903/i.html The Crucified Dialogue]</ref>
