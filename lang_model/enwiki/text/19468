Skrepenak had considered running for [[Don Sherwood]]'s [[United States House of Representatives]] seat that was contested and won by [[Chris Carney]] in the 2006 elections.  He had admitted aspirations for higher office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swingstateproject.com/2005/06/pa-10_greg_skre.html|title=PA-10: Greg Skrepenak|author=Brigham, Bob|publisher=swingstateproject.com|accessdate=2007-11-07|date=[[2005-06-22]]}}</ref>  However, after meetings with the National [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] he decided not to run for the [[United States Congress]] in the heavily [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] district. Congressman Sherwood's defeat allowed the district to go Democratic for the first time since 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15125690&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=455154&rfi=6|title=Skrepenak cancels run for Congress|publisher=Townnews.com |work=CitizensVoice.com|accessdate=2007-11-07|date=[[2007-08-31]]|author=Skrapits, Elizabeth}}</ref> Skrepenak was re-elected by finishing among the top three in a contest for county commissioner.
