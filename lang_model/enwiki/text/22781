The '''United States Military Academy at West Point''' (also known '''USMA''', '''West Point''', or '''Army''') is a four-year coeducational [[United States Service academies|federal service academy]] located at [[West Point, New York|West Point]], [[New York]]. Established in 1802, USMA is the oldest of the [[United States of America|United States']] five service academies. The military garrison at West Point was occupied in 1778 and played a key role in the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]]. The academy sits on scenic high ground overlooking the [[Hudson River]], {{convert|50|mi|km|0|sp=us}} north of [[New York City]]. The entire central campus is a [[National Historic Landmark|national landmark]] and home to scores of historic sites, buildings, and monuments. The majority of the campus's [[Gothic Revival architecture|neogothic]] buildings are constructed from gray and black granite. The campus is a popular tourist destination complete with a large visitor center and the oldest museum in the [[United States Army]].

Candidates for admission must both apply directly to the academy and receive a nomination, usually from a [[United States House of Representatives|congressman]]. Students are officers-in-training and are referred to as [[cadets]].  Tuition for cadets is fully funded by the Army in exchange for an active duty service obligation upon graduation. Approximately 1,000 cadets graduate each spring and are [[commissioned officer|commissioned]] as [[Second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenants]]. The academic program grants a [[bachelor of science]] degree with a curriculum that grades cadets' performance upon a broad academic program, military leadership performance, and mandatory participation in competitive athletics. Cadets are required to adhere to the [[Cadet Honor Code]], which states that "a cadet will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do".

Because of the academy's age and unique mission, its traditions influenced other institutions. It was the first American college to have class rings, and its technical curriculum was a model for later engineering schools. West Point's student body has a unique rank structure and lexicon.  All cadets reside on campus and dine together en masse on weekdays for breakfast and lunch. The academy fields fifteen men's and nine women's [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) sports teams while every student competes in at least one sport each semester. The [[college football|football]] team was a national power in the early 20th&nbsp;century, winning three national championships. Its alumni are collectively referred to as "The Long Gray Line" and its ranks include two [[President of the United States|American presidents]], numerous famous [[General (United States)|generals]], and seventy-four [[Medal of Honor]] recipients.

[[Image:Thayer Statue at West Point.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Thayer monument]]
In 1817, [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Sylvanus Thayer]] became the Superintendent and established the curriculum still in use to this day.  Thayer instilled strict disciplinary standards, set an standard course of academic study, and emphasized honorable conduct.  Known as the "Father of the Military Academy", he is honored with a monument on campus for the profound impact he left upon the academy's history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/westpoint/history_1a1.html|title=Sylvanus Thayer|publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of American History|accessdate=2008-12-17}}</ref><ref>Atkinson (1989), p. 54.</ref>  Founded to be a school of engineering, for the first half of the 19th&nbsp;century, USMA graduates gained recognition for engineering the bulk of the nation's initial railway lines, bridges, harbors and roads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/westpoint/history_1a.html|title=A School for the Nation|publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of American History|accessdate=2009-1-10}}</ref><ref name="McMp6">McMaster (1952), p. 6.</ref><ref name="otherp13">Endler (19980, p. 12.</ref>  The academy was the only engineering school in the country until the founding of [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in 1824.

The [[Mexican<U+2013>American War]] brought the academy to prominence as graduates proved themselves in battle for the first time. Future [[United States Civil War|Civil War]] commanders [[Ulysses S.

===After the Civil War===

Immediately following the Civil War, the academy enjoyed unprecedented fame as a result of the role its graduates had played.<ref>Crackel (2002), p. 137.</ref> However, the post-war years were a difficult time for the academy as it struggled to admit and reintegrate cadets from former confederate states.<ref name="postcw">{{cite web|url=http://www.usma.edu/Bicentennial/history/1865.asp|title=Postwar Change and Contraction|work=USMA Bicentennial|publisher=United States Military Academy|accessdate=2009-1-2}}</ref> The first cadets from Southern states were re-admitted in 1868, and 1870 saw the admission of the first African-American cadet, James Webster Smith of [[South Carolina]].<ref name="postcw"/><ref>Crackel (2002), p. 145.</ref> Smith was dismissed for academic deficiency in 1874, so [[Henry O.

Pershing]] from the class of 1886.<ref name="postcw"/> Goethals gained prominence as the chief engineer of the [[Panama Canal]],<ref>Poughkeepsie (2003), p. 65.</ref> and Pershing would become famous for his exploits against the famed [[Pancho Villa]] in Mexico and later for leading American Forces during World War I.<ref>Poughkeepsie (2003), p. 52.</ref> 

Besides the integration of southern-state and African-American cadets, the post-war academy also struggled with the issue of [[hazing]].  In its first 65&nbsp;years, hazing was uncommon or non-existent beyond small pranks played upon the incoming freshmen, but it took a harsher tone as Civil War veterans began to fill the incoming freshman classes.  The upper class cadets saw it as their duty to "teach the plebes their manners".<ref>Ambrose (1966), p. 223.</ref>  Hazing at the academy entered the national spotlight with the death of former cadet Oscar Booz in 1901.  Congressional hearings, which included testimony by [[Douglas MacArthur]], investigated his death and the pattern of systemic hazing of freshmen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citadel.edu/english/bullies&cowards.html|title="Bullies and Cowards: The West Point Hazing Scandal 1898<U+2013>1901|publisher=Greenwood Press|accessdate=2009-1-31}}</ref>  When MacArthur returned as superintendent, he made an effort to end the practice of hazing the incoming freshmen by placing Army Sergeants in charge of training new cadets during freshman summer.<ref>Ambrose, (1966), p. 277.</ref>  The practice of hazing continued on some levels well into the late 20th century, but is no longer allowed in the present day.<ref>Lipsky (2002), pp. 21, 27.</ref>
[[Image:The USMA Corps in mid 1800s.jpg|left|thumb|Corps of Cadets c. 1870]]

The demand for junior officers during the [[Spanish American War]] caused the class of 1899 to graduate early, and the [[Philippine Insurrection]] did the same for the class of 1901.  This increased demand for officers led Congress to increase the size of the Corps of Cadets to 481&nbsp;cadets in 1900.<ref name="ww1">{{cite web|url=http://www.usma.edu/Bicentennial/history/1890.asp|title=Supporting an Emerging Global Power|work=USMA Bicentennial|publisher=United States Military Academy|accessdate=2009-1-2}}</ref>  The period between 1900 and 1915 saw a construction boom as much of West Point's old infrastructure was rebuilt.<ref name="ww1"/> Many of the academy's most famous graduates graduated during the 15-year period between 1900 and 1915: Douglas MacArthur (1903), [[Joseph Stilwell]] (1904), [[Henry "Hap" Arnold]] (1907), [[George S. Patton]] (1909), [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], and [[Omar Bradley]] (both 1915).  The class of 1915 is known as "[[the class the stars fell on]]" for the exceptionally high percentage of general officers that rose from that class (59 of 164).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/westpoint/history_6b.html|title=The Class the Stars Fell On|publisher=Smithsonian National American History Museum|accessdate=2008-12-16}}</ref><ref>Simpson (1982), p. 178.</ref> With war raging in Europe, Congress anticipated potential American involvement and increased the authorized strength to 1,332 cadets in 1916. The outbreak of America's involvement in World War I caused a sharp increase in the demand for army officers, and the academy accelerated the graduation for all three of the upper classes to meet this requirement. By the war's end in 1918, only the freshman cadets remained (those who had entered in the summer of 1918).<ref name="ww1"/>

Douglas MacArthur became superintendent in 1919, instituting sweeping reforms to the academic process, including introducing a greater emphasis on history and [[humanities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/westpoint/history_6a.html|title=Restoring the Academy|publisher=Smithsonian National American History Museum|accessdate=2008-12-17}}</ref> He made major changes to the field training regimen and the Cadet Honor Committee was formed under his watch in 1922.<ref>Ambrose (1966), pp. 278&ndash;280.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usma.edu/committees/honor/Info/main.htm|title=Overview|publisher=Cadet Honor Committee|accessdate=2009-1-2}}</ref> MacArthur was a firm supporter of athletics at the academy, as he famously said "Upon the fields of friendly strife are sown the seeds that, upon other fields, on other days, will bear the fruits of victory."<ref name="Ambrose 1966, p. 275">Ambrose (1966), p. 275.</ref> West Point was first officially accredited in 1925, and in 1933 began granting bachelor of science degrees to all graduates.<ref name="prewwII">{{cite web|title=Interwar Expansion|publisher=United States Military Academy|url=http://www.usma.edu/Bicentennial/history/1919.asp|accessdate=2009-1-20}}</ref>  In 1935, the academy's authorized strength increased to 1,960 cadets.<ref name="prewwII"/>

===World War II and Cold War===
As [[World War II]] (WWII) engulfed Europe, Congress authorized an increase to 2,496 cadets in 1942, and began graduating classes early.  The class of 1943 graduated six months early in January 1943, and the next four classes graduated after only three years.<ref name="wwII">{{cite web|url=http://www.usma.edu/Bicentennial/history/1939.asp|title=World War II and a Modern Academy|work=USMA Bicentennial|publisher=United States Military Academy|accessdate=2009-1-20}}</ref> To accommodate this accelerated schedule, summer training was formally moved to a recently acquired piece of land southwest of main post.  The site would later become Camp Buckner.<ref>Ambrose (1966) p. 208.</ref>  West Point played a prominent role in WWII; four out of five of the five-star generals were alumni and nearly 500&nbsp;graduates gave their lives.<ref name="wwII"/>  Immediately following the war in 1945, [[Maxwell Taylor]] (class of 1922) became superintendent.

Unlike previous conflicts, the [[Korean War]] did not disrupt class graduation schedules. More than half of the army leadership during the war was composed of academy graduates. As a result, 157&nbsp;alumni perished in the conflict.<ref name="coldwar">{{cite web|title=Meeting the challenges of the Cold War|publisher=United States Military Academy|url=http://www.usma.edu/Bicentennial/history/1950.asp|accessdate=2009-1-20}}</ref>  [[Garrison H.

In 1985, cadets were formally authorized to declare an academic major; all previous graduates had been awarded a general bachelor of science degree.

The academy grounds are home to numerous monuments and statues. The central cadet area hosts the largest number, and includes monuments to [[George Washington]], [[Sylvanus Thayer]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Douglas MacArthur]], [[Tadeusz Kosciuszko]], and [[John Sedgwick]]. A monument to [[George S. Patton]] was dedicated in front of the cadet library in 1950,<ref>Palka (2008), p. 179.</ref> but in 2004 it was placed in storage to make room for the construction of Jefferson Hall and has yet to be relocated.  There is also a statue commemorating brotherhood and friendship from the [[L'Ecole Polytechnique]] in the cadet central area just outside Nininger Hall.

[[Image:Sec Def Gates & LTG Hagenbeck at USMA.jpg|right|thumb|LTG Franklin Hagenbeck with [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]]]]
The commanding officer at the USMA is the [[Superintendents of the United States Military Academy|Superintendent]]. This position is roughly equivalent to the [[university president|president of a civilian university]], but due to his status as the commanding general of the academy, the Superintendent holds more influence over the daily lives of the cadets than would a civilian university president. Since 1812, all Superintendents have been West Point graduates, though this has never been an official prerequisite to hold that position. In recent years, the position of Superintendent has been held by a [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]]. The current Superintendent, Lieutenant General [[Franklin L. Hagenbeck]], took command on 9 June 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usma.edu/Superintendent/bio.asp|title=Lieutenant General Franklin L. Hagenbeck|publisher=United States Military Academy|accessdate=2009-1-24}}</ref>  The academy is a direct reporting unit, and as such, the Superintendent reports directly to the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff (CSA)]].<ref>{{cite web |title =ALOG News: Army approved new AMC command |publisher =Army Logistician |url =http://www.almc.army.mil/alog/issues/SepOct06/alog_news.html |accessdate =2008-1-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title =Army Regulation 10-87: Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and Direct Reporting Units |publisher =Department of the Army |url =http://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/ar10-87.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate =2009-1-17}}</ref>

There are two other general officer positions at the academy. [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] Michael S. Linnington is the Commandant of Cadets,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usma.edu/USCC/comscorner.htm|title=Commandant's Corner|publisher=United States Military Academy|accessdate=2008-10-23}}</ref> and Brigadier General Patrick Finnegan is the Dean of the Academic Board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dean.usma.edu/DeansCorner/dean_bio.cfm|title=Brigadier General Patrick Finnegan|publisher=United States Military Academy|accessdate=2008-10-23}}</ref>  There are 13 academic departments at USMA, each with a colonel as the head of department. These 13 tenured colonels comprise the core of the Academic Board. These officers are titled "Professors USMA" or PUSMA.<ref>Lea, p. 214.</ref> The academy is also overseen by the Board of Visitors (BOV). The BOV is a panel of Senators, Congressional Representatives, and presidential appointees who "shall inquire into the morale and discipline, curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal affairs, academic methods, and other matters relating to the academy that the board decides to consider". Currently the BOV is chaired by Senator [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]] and is composed of four Senators, five Congressmen, and six presidential appointees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usma.edu/bov.asp|title=Board of Visitors|publisher=United States Military Academy|accessdate=2009-1-1}}</ref>

===Academics===
The academy's teaching style is known as the "Thayer method", which was imparted by Sylvanus Thayer during his tour as Superintendent.<ref>Atkinson (1989), p. 521.</ref> The Thayer method emphasizes small classes with daily homework, and strives to make students actively responsible for their own learning by completing homework assignments prior to class and bringing the work to class to discuss collaboratively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.west-point.org/parent/wppc_michigan/handbook.html|title=Plebe Parent Handbook, Class of 2006: Academic Year|work=West Point Parent Club of Michigan|publisher=West-Point.org|accessdate=2008-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Shell |first=Amy |title=The Thayer method of instruction at the United States Military Academy: a modest history and a modern personal account |journal=PRIMUS: problems, resources, and issues in mathematics undergraduate studies |volume=12 |issue=1 |year=2002 |pages=27<U+2013>38 |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=584623|accessdate=2009-1-25}}</ref>

===Military===
[[Image:USMA Cadets Cross a Rope Bridge.jpg|right|thumb|Cadets cross a rope bridge during summer training]]
All cadets receive commissioning as Second Lieutenants upon graduation so military and leadership education is nested with academic instruction.  Military training and discipline fall under purview of the Office of the Commandant. Entering freshmen, or fourth class cadets, are referred to as "New Cadets", and enter the academy on Reception Day or "R-day",<ref>Crackel (1991), p. 283.</ref> which marks the start of cadet basic training (CBT), known colloquially as "Beast Barracks", or simply "Beast".<ref>Simpson (1982), p. 102.</ref><ref>Atkinson (1989), p. 9.</ref> Most cadets consider Beast to be their most difficult time at the academy because of the strenuous transition from civilian to military life. Their second summer, cadets undergo cadet field training (CFT) at nearby Camp Buckner, where they train more advanced field craft and military skills. During a cadet's third summer, they may serve as instructors for CBT or CFT. Rising Firstie (senior) cadets now also spend one month training at Camp Buckner, where they train for modern tactical situations that they will soon face as new platoon leaders. Cadets also have the opportunity during their second, third and fourth summers to serve in active army units and military schools around the world.<ref>Neff (2007), pp.&nbsp;88&ndash;89.</ref>

Active duty officers in the rank of [[Captain (land)|Captain]] or [[Major]] serve as company Tactical Officers (Tac).<ref>Atkinson (1989), p. 44.</ref> The role of the Tac is to mentor, train, and teach the cadets proper standards of good order and discipline and to be good role models for the cadets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usma.edu/uscc/btd/btdindex.htm|title=Brigade Tactical Department|publisher=Office of the Commandant, USMA|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref> There is one Tac for every cadet company. There is also one senior Non-Commissioned Officer to assist each Tac, known as TacNCOs.<ref>Lea, p. 190.</ref>

The Department of Military Instruction (DMI) is responsible for all military arts and sciences education as well as planning and executing the cadet summer training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usma.edu/dmi/|title=Department of Military Instruction|publisher=United States Military Academy|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref> Within DMI there is a representative from each of the Army's branches. These "branch reps" serve as proponents for their respective branches and liaise with cadets as they prepare for branch selection and graduation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Branch Representatives|publisher=Department of Military Instruction|url=http://www.usma.edu/dmi/branching.htm|accessdate=2008-1-19}}</ref>

===Physical===
[[Image:Horizontal Ladder and Vertical Rope USMA IOCT.JPG|right|thumb|Cadets perform the IOCT]]
The [[Department of Physical Education]] (DPE) administers the physical program, which includes both physical education classes, physical fitness testing, and competitive athletics. The head of DPE holds the title of Master of the Sword, dating to the 1800s when DPE taught swordsmanship as part of the curriculum.<ref>Crowley and Guinzburg, p. 235.</ref>  

All cadets take a prescribed series of physical fitness courses. All cadets take military movement (applied gymnastics), boxing (men) or self defense (women), swimming, and beginning in 2009, [[Modern Army Combatives|advanced combatives]]. Cadets can also take elective physical activity classes such as [[Scuba diving|scuba]], rock climbing, and aerobic fitness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usma.edu/dpe/courseofferings.htm|title=Course Offerings|publisher=USMA Department of Physical Education|accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref>

As with all soldiers in the Army, cadets also must pass the [[APFT|Army Physical Fitness Test]] twice per year. Additionally, during their junior year, cadets must pass the [[Indoor Obstacle Course Test]] (IOCT), which DPE has administered in [[Hayes Gymnasium|Hayes gymnasium]] since 1944.<ref>Barkalow (1990), p. 77.</ref><ref>{{cite paper|author=Degan, Robert|title=The Evolution of Physical Education at the United States Military Academy|publisher=University of Wisconsin|year=1968}}</ref>

Since [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s tenure as superintendent, every cadet has been required to participate in either an [[NCAA|intercollegiate sport]], a [[sports club|club sport]], or an [[intramural]] (referred to as "company athletics") sport each semester.<ref name="Ambrose 1966, p. 275"/>

===Moral and ethical training===
[[Image:Cadet Honor Plaze USMA Dec 2008.JPG|right|thumb|Class of '57 honor memorial on which the honor code is inscribed]]
Moral-ethical development occurs throughout the entirety of the cadet experience by living under the honor code and through formal leadership programs available at the academy. These include instruction in the values of the military profession through Professional Military Ethics Education (PME<sup>2</sup>), voluntary religious programs, interaction with staff and faculty role models, and an extensive guest-speaker program. The foundation of the ethical code at West Point is found in the academy's motto, "Duty, Honor, Country".<ref name="motto">{{cite web |title =About the Academy |publisher =United States Military Academy |url = http://www.usma.edu/about.asp |accessdate =2008-12-25 }}</ref>

West Point's [[Cadet Honor Code]] reads simply that: "A cadet will not lie, cheat, or steal, or tolerate those who do."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://admissions.usma.edu/Prospectus/wpe_lifeinthecorps.cfm|title=Life in the Corps|publisher=USMA Office of Admissions|accessdate=2008-12-30}}</ref> Cadets accused of violating the Honor Code face an investigative and hearing process. If they are found guilty by a jury of their peers, they face severe consequences ranging from being "turned back" (repeating an academic year) to separation from the academy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usma.edu/Committees/Honor/index.htm|title=Cadet Honor Committee|publisher=United States Military Academy|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref> Cadets previously enforced an unofficial sanction known as "silencing" by not speaking to cadets accused of violating the honor code, but the practice ended in 1973 after national scrutiny.<ref>{{cite news|title=Silent Agony Ends for Cadet at Point |last=Greenhouses |first=Linda |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=1973-6-7|page=93}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cadet Committee at West Point Does Away with 'The Silence' |last=Feron |first=James |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=1973-9-12}}</ref>

Throughout the four years at the academy, Cadets take PME<sup>2</sup> classes.  These classes start during Cadet Basic Training and run the entire breadth of their time at the academy. As the cadets mature in rank and experience, they transform from receivers of information to facilitators and teachers of PME<sup>2</sup> topics. The Simon Center for the Professional Military Ethic, located in Ninenger Hall in central area, is the coordinator for most PME<sup>2</sup> training in conjunction with the cadet TAC officers.<ref name="SCPME">{{cite web|url=http://www.usma.edu/Cpme/|title=Simon Center for the Professional Military Ethic|publisher=United States Military Academy|accessdate=2008-12-30}}</ref>

==Cadet life==
===Rank and organization===
[[Image:USMA Cadet Rank -1.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Firstie shoulder sleeve rank]]
Cadets are not referred to as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, or seniors. Instead they are officially called fourth class, third class, second class, and first class cadets. Colloquially, freshmen are ''plebes'', sophomores are ''yearlings'' or ''yuks'', juniors are ''cows'', and seniors are ''firsties''.<ref>Atkinson (1989), p. 43.</ref><ref>Barkalow (1990), pp. 23, 81, 109, 124.</ref> Some of the origins of the class names are known, some are not. [[plebs|Plebians]] were the lower class of ancient Roman society, while yearling is a euphemism for a year-old animal. The origin of cow is less known. There are many theories for the origin of cow, most of which center around the fact that in years past, cadets could not take leave until cow year, and thus the phrase, "until the cows come home". Firstie is short for first class cadet.


The Corps of Cadets is officially organized into a brigade. The senior ranking cadet, the Brigade Commander, is known traditionally as the ''First Captain''. The brigade is organized into four regiments. Within each regiment there are two battalions, which consists of four companies.<ref name="murphyp10">Murphy (2008), p. 10.</ref> Companies are lettered A through H, with a number signifying which regiment it belongs to. For example, there are four "A" companies: A1, A2, A3, and A4. First class cadets hold the leadership positions within the brigade from the First Captain down to platoon leaders within the companies.

All cadets reside on campus for their entire four years in one of the seven barracks buildings. Most cadets are housed with one roommate, but some rooms are designed for three cadets. Cadets are grouped into "companies", which have alpha-numeric codes to identify them. All companies live together in the same barracks area.<ref>Lipsky (2003), p. 29.</ref> The academy has the cadets change companies after their freshmen or sophomore years. This process is known as scrambling, and the method of scrambling has changed several times in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.west-point.org/class/usma1999/article/107/usma-update/|title=K.

Each cadet class celebrates at least one special "class weekend" per academic year. Fourth&nbsp;class cadets participate in Plebe Parent Weekend during the first weekend of spring break. In February, third&nbsp;class cadets celebrate the winter season with Yearling Winter Weekend. In late January the second&nbsp;class cadets celebrate 500th&nbsp;Night, marking the remaining 500&nbsp;days before graduation. First class cadets celebrate three different formal occasions. In late August, first&nbsp;class cadets celebrate [[Ring Weekend]], in February they mark their last 100 days with 100th&nbsp;Night, and in May they have a full week of events culminating in their graduation. All of the "class weekends" involve a formal dinner and social dance, known in old cadet slang as a "hop", held at Eisenhower Hall.<ref>{{cite web|title=Class Weekends|publisher=Directorate of Cadet Activities|url=http://www.usma.edu/uscc/DCA/prog/weekends.htm|accessdate=2009-1-20}}</ref><ref>Murphy (2008), p. 20.</ref>

==Traditions==

Due to West Point's age and its uniquely singular mission of producing army officers, it has many time-honored traditions. The list below are some of the traditions unique to or started by the academy.

===Cullum number===
[[Image:WP Ring 2.jpg|thumb|right|2007 West Point class ring]]
<!--[[Image:Goat Engineer.jpg|right|thumb|2008 Goat<U+2013>Engineer Game]]-->
The Cullum number is a reference and identification number assigned to each graduate. It was created by [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] Major General [[George Washington Cullum|George W. Cullum]] (USMA Class of 1833) who, in 1850, began the monumental work of chronicling the biographies of every graduate. He assigned number one to the first West Point graduate, [[Joseph Gardner Swift]], and then numbered all successive graduates in sequence. Before his death in 1892, General Cullum completed the first three volumes of a work that eventually comprised 10&nbsp;volumes, entitled ''General Cullum<U+2019>s Biographical Register of the Officers and Graduates of the United States Military Academy, and covering USMA classes from 1802 through 1850''. From 1802 through the Class of 1977, graduates were listed by general order of Merit. Beginning with the Class of 1978, graduates were listed alphabetically, and then by date of graduation. Seven graduates have an "A" suffix after their Cullum Number. For various reasons these graduates were omitted from the original class roster, and a suffix letter was added to avoid renumbering the entire class and subsequent classes.<ref name="cullum#">{{cite web|url=http://www.aogusma.org/CLASS/Handbook/cullum.htm|title=Annex G: Class and Cullum Files|work=Handbook for Graduated Officers, publisher=AOG|accessdate=2009-1-1}}</ref>

===Class ring===
West Point began the collegiate tradition of the [[class ring]], beginning with the class of 1835.<ref name="ring">{{cite web|url=http://digital-library.usma.edu/collections/photographs/classrings/|title=USMA Class Rings|publisher=USMA Library Special Collections|accessdate=2008-12-31}}</ref> The class of 1836 chose no rings, and the class of 1879 had cuff links in lieu of a class ring. Prior to 1917, cadets could design much of the ring individually, but now only the center stone can be individualized.<ref name="ring"/>  One side of the ring bears the academy crest, while the other side bears the class crest and the center stone ring bears the words ''West Point'' and the class year.  The academy library has a large collection of cadet rings on display.<ref>Neff (2007), p. 284.</ref>  Senior cadets receive their rings during [[Ring Weekend]] in the early fall of their senior year.  Immediately after returning to the barracks after receiving their rings, fourth class cadets take the opportunity to surround senior cadets from their company and ask to touch their rings.  After reciting a poem known to cadets as the "Ring Poop", the senior usually grants the freshmen permission to touch the ring.<ref>Hulse (1994), p. 264.</ref>

===Thayer Award===
[[Image:Sedgwick's Spurs.JPG|right|thumb|Some cadets spin Sedgwick's spurs for good luck prior to difficult exams.]]
{{main|Sylvanus Thayer Award}}
West Point is home to the Sylvanus Thayer Award. Given annually by the academy since 1958, the award honors an outstanding citizen whose service and accomplishments in the national interest exemplify the academy's motto, "Duty, Honor, Country".<ref name="thayeraward">{{cite web|url=https://www.westpointaog.org/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=946|title=The Sylvanus Thayer Award|publisher=Association of Graduates|accessdate=2009-1-1}}</ref> Currently, the award guidelines state that the recipient not be a graduate of the academy. The award has been awarded to many notable American citizens, to include [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Colin Powell]], [[Tom Brokaw]], [[Sandra Day O'Conner]], [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Carl Vinson]], [[Douglas MacArthur]], [[Barbara Jordan]], [[William J. Perry]], and [[Bob Hope]].<ref name="thayeraward"/>

===Sedgwick's spurs===
A monument to Union general [[John Sedgwick]] stands on the outskirts of the parade field. Sedgwick's bronze statue has [[spur]]s that freely rotate. Cadet legend states that if a cadet is in danger of failing a class, they are to don their full-dress parade uniform the night before the final exam. If the cadet visits the statue and spins the spurs at the stroke of midnight, the cadet will pass the exam and the course.<ref>Lea (2003), p. 409.</ref> Although being out of of their rooms after midnight is officially against regulations, violations have been known to be overlooked for the sake of tradition.<ref>Barkalow (1990), p. 78.</ref>

===Goat<U+2013>Engineer game===
As part of the run-up to the Navy football game, the Corps of Cadets plays the Goat<U+2013>Engineer game.<ref name="gogoats">{{cite web |title =Early days of spirit: first Goat-Engineer game |publisher =''Pointer View''  |url =http://www.usma.edu/Dcomm/PV/991203/bonfire.htm |accessdate =2009-1-12}}</ref> First played in 1907, it is a game between the "Goats" (the bottom half of the senior class academically), and the "Engineers" (the top half).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://drsm.org/WPPC/GOAT-_Engineer_Game.pdf|format=PDF|title=Fact Sheet: Goat-Engineer Game|publisher=USMA Public Affairs Office|accessdate=2008-12-31}}</ref> The game is played with full pads and helmets using [[eight-man football]] rules at Michie Stadium. Legend states that Army will beat Navy if the goats win, and the opposite if the Engineers win.<ref name="gogoats"/>  In recent years, female cadets have began playing a [[flag football]] contest, so there are now two Goat<U+2013>Engineer games, played back to back the same night.<ref>{{cite web |title =Army-Navy Spirit Activities |publisher =West Point Public Affairs Office |url =http://www.usma.edu/Dcomm/PressReleasesbd/nr40-07ArmyNavySpiritWeek.htm |accessdate =2009-1-12}}</ref>

===Football===
{{main|Army Black Knights football}}

Army [[American football|football]] began in 1890, when [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] challenged the cadets to a game of the relatively new sport. Navy defeated Army at West Point that year, but Army avenged the loss in [[Annapolis, MD|Annapolis]] the following year.<ref>Ambrose (1966), pp. 305&ndash;306.</ref> The academies still clash every December in what is traditionally the last regular-season Division I college-football game.

Approximately 15% of cadets are members of a club sport team. West Point fields a total of 24&nbsp;club sports teams and in the last two years, academy club teams have won six national championships.  In 2008, West Point club sport teams won national championships in boxing, orienteering, men's team handball, and women's pistol, while in 2007, West Point captured national titles in cycling and women's team handball.<ref name ="dca">{{cite web|url=http://www.usma.edu/USCC/DCA/clubs/gallery.htm#NatChamps|title=DCA & Clubs Photo Pages|publisher=Directorate of Cadet Activities|accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref>
