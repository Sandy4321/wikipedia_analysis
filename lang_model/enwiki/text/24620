'''D<U+00E6>lenenga idrettspark''' is a sports facility located at [[Gr<U+00FC>nerl<U+00F8>kka]] in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. It consists of an [[artificial turf]] [[football pitch]], a club house and an indoor [[ice rink]]<U+2014>'''Gr<U+00FC>nerhallen'''. The facilities are owned by the [[Oslo|Municipality of Oslo]] and used and operated by [[Gr<U+00FC>ner IL]], the local sports club.

The venue opened in 1916 and was originally used for football, [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] and [[speed skating]]. The club house was completed in 1928 and has since been used for [[martial arts]]. From 1929, a [[velodrome]] course was installed, which remained in use until 1940. During the 1930s, the venue was the main Oslo stadium for the [[Arbeidernes Idrettsforbund|Workers' Sports Federation]] (AIF). A [[motorcycle speedway|speedway]] course was installed in 1947 and remained in use until 1968. The venue featured [[ice hockey at the 1952 Winter Olympics|eight ice hockey matches]] and [[bandy at the 1952 Winter Olympics|two bandy matches]] during the [[1952 Winter Olympics]]. [[Artificial ice]] was laid in 1985 and the skating hall opened in 1995, two years before the artificial turf was laid.

In 1947, the velodrome was removed and the track converted for use for speedway.<ref name=lex /> For the 1952 Winter Olympics, the venue was upgraded with a new ice hockey clock, a new lighting system and new ice hockey boards.<ref name=ol32>Organising Committee for the VI Winter Olympic Games (1952): 32</ref> The speedway course was dismounted in 1968.<ref name=lex /> During the 1980s, the stadium became a central location for [[drug dealing]], but the traffic moved away during the 1990s.<ref>Fossen (1998): 145</ref> In 1985, [[artificial ice]] was laid north of the football pitch, costing 2.1 million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK). Of this, NOK&nbsp;1.3 million was financed by Gr<U+00FC>ner IL through loans.<ref name=open>{{cite news |title=Gr<U+00FC>nerhallen st<U+00E5>r klar |last=Nygaard |first=Brynjul |work=[[Aftenposten Aften]] |date=6 October 1995 |page=60 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> At the same time a new gravel pitch was laid on the football field.<ref name=nye />

The artificial ice increased the popularity of playing ice hockey in the neighborhood.

The hall was estimated to cost NOK&nbsp;23.4 million and the contract was awarded to Mur 6 Tax.

Ahead of 1997, the municipal council granted NOK&nbsp;3.2 million to lay artificial turf at D<U+00E6>lenenga. Construction started in May and the pitch was taken into use on 4 September 1997. The new turf was Belgian-manufactured, sand-filled Superfoot 32.<ref name=nye /> The upgrade also saw the first upgrades to the terraces in the stadium's history.<ref name=f143 /> New artificial turf was laid in 2008.<ref name=notat>{{cite web |url=http://www.sak.oslo.kommune.no/dok/Bys%5C0%5CVEDLEGG%5C2008003503-148275.pdf |title=Idrettsanlegg p<U+00E5> D<U+00E6>lenenga |publisher=[[Oslo|Municipality of Oslo]] |date=15 April 2008 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=30 May 2012 |archivedate=30 May 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/683Epp7ix |deadurl=no}}</ref>
