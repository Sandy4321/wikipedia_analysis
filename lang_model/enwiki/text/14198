==Overview==
[[Image:Unfinished-pop-century.jpg|thumb|200px|An incomplete [[Pop Century Resort|Pop Century]] Legendary Years building can be seen across the Hourglass Lake. The Generation Gap Bridge would have connected both halves of the resort.]]

===Pop Century plans===
Originally, the land that will house the Art of Animation Resort was planned to be part of [[Disney's Pop Century Resort]] as part of the "Legendary Years" section. Several buildings were constructed for these plans, some even to the point of adding decorative details. While one half of Pop Century (the "Classic Years") opened in 2003, the other half was left abandoned following the tourism halt after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.<ref name="thedailydisney2000">{{cite web|url=http://thedailydisney.com/blog/2010/05/disney-to-build-2000-room-hotel-dubbed-disneys-art-of-animation-resort/ |title=New Disney hotel: Disney to build 2,000-room hotel dubbed Disney's Art of Animation Resort |publisher=TheDailyDisney.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>

===Construction and opening===
Disney started to prepare the land for the resort in January 2010, and construction began in the summer of that year.<ref name="thedisneyblog">{{cite web|url=http://thedisneyblog.com/2010/05/14/more-details-on-disneys-art-of-animation-resort/ |title=More details on Disney<U+2019>s Art of Animation Resort |publisher=TheDisneyBlog.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-10}}</ref> At the time of this announcement on May 12, 2010, Disney did not say how much construction is expecting to cost, but it was mentioned that approximately 800 jobs will be produced. Should everything go as expected, the resort will open in the summer of 2012.<ref name="thedailydisney2000"/>

When the "Legendary Years" buildings were first being made, a bridge named the Generation Gap Bridge was constructed to connect both parts of Pop Century and made them accessible to each other. However, the bridge's future remains unknown now that new plans have been announced.

==Resort theming==
The resort is designed "with families in mind." It will feature four of Disney's popular character themes: ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[The Lion King]]'', and ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''. Much like the other Disney Value Resorts, giant versions of various items will be built around the hotel on each of the ten wings, such as a {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on}} model of King Triton. In total, there will be 1,980 rooms. 1,120 of them will be family suites capable of housing up to six people, featuring living rooms and bedrooms. The remaining 864 will sport the standard value layout.<ref name="thedisneyblog" /><ref name="disneyparksblog">{{cite web|url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2010/05/disneys-art-of-animation-resort-unveiled/ |title=Disney<U+2019>s Art of Animation Resort Unveiled <U+00AB> Disney Parks Blog |publisher=Disneyparks.disney.go.com |date=2010-05-12 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref> When completed, the resort will have a total of ten buildings, as well as three themed pools.

;Cars : The ''Cars'' section of the resort will be themed like the Cozy Cone Motel that has featured in the film. Resort buildings will be themed with the movie's characters, including Lightning McQueen, Sally, Mater, and Luigi and Guido.  This section of the resort is scheduled to open in late July 2012. 

;Finding Nemo : The ''Finding Nemo'' section of the resort will be themed with the ocean setting featured in the film, with underwater plant and animal decorations throughout the buildings.  This will be the first section of the resort and will open on May 31, 2012. 

;The Lion King : ''The Lion King'' section of the resort will feature a "natural" setting, such as that found in the wild.  This section of the resort should open in late September 2012. 

;The Little Mermaid : ''The Little Mermaid'' section of the resort will be themed with 600 cutout objects on resort balconies. "Under the Sea" decorations will be incorporated throughout the section.<ref>http://www.insidethemagic.net/2011/05/first-look-at-new-art-of-animation-resort-concept-art-and-rooms-shown-at-destination-d-walt-disney-world/</ref>   This section of the resort will have exterior walkways, where the other sections will have enclosed interior walkways between the rooms.

;The Art of Animation : ''Disney's Art of Animation Resort'' doesn't just celebrate four great animated movies, it also highlights the act of animation itself.   This is reflected in the sketchbook motif and simple line drawings on the building exteriors and in the names of the retail and public areas:  Landscapes Cafe, Animation Hall, Ink and Paint Shop,and Pixel Play Arcade.<ref>http://www.buildabettermousetrip.com/images/wdw/ValueArtOfAnimation/index.htm/</ref>
