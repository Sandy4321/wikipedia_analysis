'''Mikael Sehul''' ([[Tigrigna language|Tigrigna]] "Mikael the Astute"; his name at birth was '''Blatta Mikael'''; c.[[1690s|1691]] - 23 June [[1779]]) was a [[Ras (title)|Ras]] or governor of [[Tigray Province|Tigray]] 1748-71 and again from 1772 until his death. He was a major political figure from the reign of [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Iyasus II of Ethiopia|Iyasu II]], and his successors until almost the time of his death.

Mikael was a son of Abeto Hezeqeyas Wolde Hawaryot snd Woizero Ishate Mariam, the daughter of Azzaz Yakub. They claimed descent from the [[Solomonic dynasty]] through his ancestor Ras [[Faris the Great]], and his father used the title Abeto, a prince of imperial cadet line. His first official wife was Woizero Walatta Gabr'el (died at [[Adwa]] after 1766), and later to Woizero Aster.

<!-- Being a powerful lord already in the Tigray region, in succession to his father, he was appointed as Dejazmatch of Tigray 20 September 1748 and of Semien 8 October 1757. Raised to the title of Ras and confirmed as Governor of Tigray, Semien, Seggada, Walqat and 44 other districts, 13th September 1759. Established his capital at Adwa.

He first enters history as having a part in some of the difficulties that was experienced by the delegation sent to [[Cairo]] to obtain a new ''[[Abuna]]'' for the Empire in [[1745]]. On their outbound trip, the party had been held up at [[Massawa]] by the local [[Naib]] for six months, and only released them after they gave him half of their funds. On the return trip, [[Abuna Yohannes XIV|Abuna Yohannes]] was held for ransom at [[Arqiqo]] until the abbot of the monastery of [[Debre Bizan]] helped him to escape. This affront was too serious to be overlooked, and the then [[Dejazmach]] Mikael was subjected to a punitive campaign by the Emperor. However Dejazmach Mikael remained too powerful, and he was soon forgiven.<sup>[[#Notes|1]]</sup>

In the reign of Iyasus's successor [[Iyoas I of Ethiopia|Iyoas I]], Dejazmach Mikael found himself the beneficiary of two dynastic ties to the [[Solomonic dynasty|Imperial house]]: Empress [[Mentewab]] in 1769 married him to her daughter Aster, and Mikael's son, [[Wolde Hayawrat]], had married to another daughter of the Empress. It was at this time that Mikael was granted the title of Ras.<sup>[[#Notes|2]]</sup>

Ras Mikael intervened in the [[Ethiopian Church]], and was a champion of the [[Karva Haymanot]] doctrine.<sup>[[#Notes|3]]</sup>

He found offence in the behavior of his superior Ras [[Anda Haymanot]] during a hunting expedition, and returned to Adwa which he fortified, and rebelled from Anda Haymanot. Eventually Ras Mikael fought, captured then executed his one-time master in [[1759]].<sup>[[#Notes|4]]</sup> Adwa was located at a strategic point on the trade route between Massawa and [[Gondar]], and from the fees and duties he extracted he was able to recruit an army of 8000 men and arm them with [[musket]]s.

Upon the death of Iyasu II, his son Iyoas took the throne and rivalry exploded between the mother of the late Emperor, and his widow.  Empress Mentewab had been crowned co-ruler when her then underage son had succeeded her husband.  Now that her son was gone, she believed that she was entitled to remain as co-ruler.  However, Iyasu's widow, [[Welete Bersabe]] (known as Wubit) of the [[Oromo]], strongly believed that it was her turn to take the leading role at the court of her son Iyoas as her mother-in-law had done during the previous reign.  The young Emperor took the side of his mother against his grandmother.  Empress Mentewab gathered her relatives from her native [[Qwara]] and their forces flooded into Gondar to support her claims.  When news of the arrival of the Qwaran troops arrived, Welete Bersabe also summoned her relatives from [[Yejju]], and throngs of Oromo soldiers arrived from that district to uphold her claims.  The city of Gondar was swamped by these two tense armies, and a bloodbath seemed imminent.

To resolve the standoff, Empress Mentewab looked to her son-in-law Ras Mikael to intervene.  Mikael Sehul arrived with an army of 26,000 promising to mediate the dispute between the two queens and their followers. He took control of the capital city of Gondar and assumed an increasingly dominant role. 

On 22 January 1768, Mikael was made Ras Bitwodad and Enderase (Viceroy) of the Empire.{{fact}} His growing power alarmed Emperor Iyoas, and after secretly exchanging messages with [[Fasil of Damot|Fasil]] the Emperor ordered Ras Mikael to return to Tigray. The Ras disobeyed and defeated Fasil's army.  He returned to Gondar and demanded an assembly of the nobility so Ras Mikael Sehul could show his proof that the Emperor Iyoas had plotted to have him killed while he was defending his throne for him.

The assembly was presented with testimony, and agreed that it was a grievous crime, deserving of death, but that as a monarch could not be killed, they merely confined the Emperor to his palace.  Mikael Sehul then ordered the Emperor killed.  As it was considered wrong to pierce the heir of Solomon with a spear, cut him with a sword, or to strike him with bullets, Mikael Sehul ordered the Emperor strangled with a length of silk in imperial red in January [[1769]]. This alarmed both dowager queens, Empress Mentewab and Welete Bersabe, and Mentewab secluded herself at her palace at [[Qusquam]] where she buried her grandson with much pomp and grandure. 

Ras Mikael then appointed the next two Emperors: [[Yohannes II of Ethiopia|Yohannes II]], who proved to be a nonentity and was quickly gotten rid of; then [[Tekle Haymanot II of Ethiopia|Tekle Haymanot II]]. Despite his power over the throne, the populace rebelled; Ras Mikael responded with a reign of terror over Gondar ([[1770]]), but failed to control the countryside where the armies of Fasil, [[Goshu of Amhara]], and [[Wand Bewossen]] of [[Begemder]] allied to fight him. The parties met at [[Sarbakusa]], where Ras Mikael was finally defeated, and finally surrendered to Wand Bawasan on [[4 June]], [[1771]]. Wand Bawasan imprisoned Mikael Sehul for a year, then either sent him back to Tigray to live out his last years as governor of that province, or Ras Mikael voluntarily retired to that province.<sup>[[#Notes|5]]</sup>

He was succeeded, each briefly, by his son Wolde Samuel of Tigray, then by his grandson Wolde Gabriel, and ultimately by his nephew Gabre Maskal.
