==Animated series==
{{main|Chaotic (TV series)}}

The TV series is based on the storyline of the original Chaotic TCG. The main protagonist is a teenager named Tom, whose friend Kaz constantly tells him of his adventures in Chaotic. Tom, who believes that Chaotic is only a card game, thinks that Kaz is making things up, until he entered a [[password]] he received from the game. It was then Tom knew that Kaz wasn't lying. In Chaotic, he also met some new friends, like the courageous Sarah and the comic Peyton, and new enemies, like the arrogant duo Klay and Krystella. Players in Chaotic go to Perim and scan new creatures and use them to battle. In Perim, Tom also got to meet many creatures, including his favorite, Maxxor. The battles between players take place in dromes, which are virtual battles where players become the creatures they choose and fight for the right to battle against the drome master(code master). In Perim, the four tribes are currently at war for the Cothica, the power that controls all of Perim. In the second season, the fifth tribe, the M'arrillians, escape from the Doors of the Deepmines and take over the other four tribes by brainwashing other creatures. The second season featured true cell animation and manga/anime like artwork.  Season three, although subtitled "Secrets of the Lost City," was actually a set of differently themed mini-stories, only a few episodes of which involved the so-called "Lost City". The show has been postponed.

==Trading card game==
{{main|Chaotic Trading Card Game}}

In the Chaotic Trading Card Game there are 5 different types of cards: Creatures, Battlegear, Attacks, Mugic, and Locations. Creatures are the cards players control to do battle. Battlegear is a specific item each creature is equipped with when it starts battle. Attacks are exactly that, they are used to do damage to the opponent's creatures. Mugic is a combination of music and magic, it is used by creatures who have mugic counters. Locations are the places where creatures can battle at, they are all places in Perim. 

There are five tribes of creatures in Chaotic: OverWorld, UnderWorld, Danian, Mipedian and M'arrillian. The OverWorld is a tribe made of various humanoid creatures and creatures which resemble real animals. The UnderWorld is a tribe which consists of creatures which resemble various monsters. Danians are usually made to resemble ants but there are some creatures based on other insects found within the tribe. Mipedians are a tribe which is made of creatures who resemble various lizards. The M'arrillians are a tribe which resembles various deep sea creatures, some of which have a see through appearance such as that found in a jellyfish., 

The game is played by two players who control an army of creatures. The object of the game is to lower the energy of your opponent's creatures to 0 by way of attacks, mugic, or creature abilities. The game can be played with a varying amount of creatures in each army (1vs1, 3vs3, 6vs6, 10vs10) and with a varying amount of complexity. The game can be played in the advanced apprentice ruleset where no mugic is used and combat is only attacks. Masters is the next step up where mugic and activated abilities are used. Masters games take longer and require full knowledge of the rules.

The rules of Chaotic are basic; each player starts the game with his creatures face-down and their battlegear face-down as well. When the game begins the creatures are flipped up and the battlegear which indicates to do so is as well. There can only be two of the same card in each army, unless specified as otherwise, cards that are limited to one per army are called unique. When the game begins the starting player (which can be chosen by who is youngest, a coin toss, etc.) starts by flipping their top location card face-up. The turn player then can move a creature to an unoccupied space on the mat, or move a creature into an opponent's occupied space. Doing this will initiate combat, this is the only way to defeat your opponents creatures in advanced apprentice seeing as no mugic or abilities are used. When combat begins the players see which creature has gained initiative, initiative is dependant on the location and the creatures that are battling in that location. Initiative can be anything from a stat to a certain tribe or an element. The player with the initiative gets to play the first attack.

Each player starts the game with an attack deck of 20 attacks and the game is started with 2 of these attacks in the hand, at the beginning of each player's turn during combat an attack is drawn. The attack cards each have build points which when added up equal 20. This prevents the hogging of good cards. During a player's turn they must play an attack, which sends it to the discard pile. By playing attacks the player decreases the energy of the opponent's creature. This is the key to winning the game.
