'''Association football''', '''soccer''', or simply '''football''', is a [[team sport]] played between two teams each consisting of eleven players. It is a ball game played on a rectangular grass field (or occasionally on an [[artificial pitch]]) with a [[goal (sport)|goal]] at each end. The object of the game is to score by manoeuvering the ball into the opposing goal. The predominant feature of the sport is that players other than the [[goalkeeper (football)|goalkeeper]]s may not use their hands or arms to propel the ball in general play. The winner of the match is the team that has scored most goals at the end of the match.

The sport is known by [[football (soccer) names|many names]] throughout the [[English language|English]]-speaking world, although football is the most common. Other names, such as association football and soccer, are often used to distinguish the game from [[football|other codes of football]], since [[football (word)|the word ''football'']] may be used to refer to several quite different games. <!-- Please see above polite suggestions before changing this line-->

The modern game developed in [[England]] following the formation of the [[Football Association]], whose 1863 set of rules created the foundations for the way the sport is played today. Football is governed internationally by [[FIFA|F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA). The most prestigious international football competition is the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], which is the most widely-viewed sporting event in the world.<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/newmedia/index/0,3509,10,00.html 2002 FIFA World Cup TV Coverage], FIFA official website.

== Nature of the game ==
{{seealso|Football (soccer) positions|Formation (football)}}
[[Image:Soccer goalkeeper.jpg|thumb|250px|A goalkeeper dives to stop the ball from entering his goal.]]
Football is played in accordance with a set of rules, known as the [[Laws of the Game]]. Two teams of eleven players each compete to get a round ball (itself known as a ''[[football (ball)|football]]'') into the other team's goal, thereby scoring a goal. The team which has scored the most goals at the conclusion of the game is the winner; if both teams have an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. 

The primary rule is that players (other than the goalkeepers) may not intentionally touch the ball with their hands or arms during play (though they do use their hands during a [[throw-in]] restart). Although players mainly use their feet to move the ball around, they may use any part of their bodies other than their hands or arms.

In typical game play, players attempt to move towards a goal through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling (running with the ball close to their feet), passing the ball from team-mate to team-mate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposition players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent who controls the ball, however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game with the ball in play at all times except when the ball has left the field of play or play has been stopped by the [[referee (football)|referee]]. When play has been stopped, it recommences with a specified restart.

At a professional level, a few goals are usually scored during a match. For example, during the [[FA Premier League 2005-06|2005-06 season]] of the [[FA Premier League]], an average of 2.48 goals per match were scored.<ref>{{cite web | title = England Premiership (2005/2006) | work = Sportpress | url = http://www.sportpress.com/stats/en/738_england_premiership_2005_2006/11_league_summary.html | accessdate = 5 June | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref>

The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper. However, during the development of the game a number of specific [[football (soccer) positions|player specialisations]] have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: [[Defender (football)|defenders]], who specialise in the prevention of scoring by opponents, [[midfielder]]s, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball in order to feed it to the forwards, also known as [[striker]]s, whose main task is to score goals. These positions are further differentiated by the side of the field that the player spends most time in. For example, there are central defenders and left midfielders. Players may spend most part of the game in a specific part of the field, but there are no restrictions and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of the players on the pitch is called the [[formation (football)|''formation'']]. Defining a team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of a team's [[manager (football)|manager]].

== History and development ==
{{seealso|Football|History of football (soccer)}}
Games revolving around the kicking of a ball have been played in many countries through history. The earliest documented version is the [[China|Chinese]] game ''[[Tsu Chu]]'' or ''cu ju'', mentioned in military manuals from the time of the [[Qin Dynasty]] (255 - 206 BCE).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Chinese and Tsu Chu | work=The Football Network | url=http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/historyoffootball/history1.asp | accessdate=5 June | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> Other ancient ball games include ''[[kemari]]'' in [[Japan]] and the [[Ancient Rome |Roman]] game ''[[Harpastum]]''. Various forms of [[mob football]] were played in medi<U+00E6>val Europe, though rules varied greatly by both period and location.

The rules of football as they are known today are based on efforts made in the mid-[[19th century]] to standardise the rules of the widely varying games of football played at the [[Independent school (UK)|private independent schools]] of [[England]]. The [[The Cambridge Rules|first set of rules]] resembling the modern game were produced at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in [[1848]], at a meeting attended by representatives from [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Winchester College|Winchester]] and [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]], but they were far from universally adopted. During the [[1850s]], many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield Football Club]] (formed by former pupils from [[Harrow School|Harrow]]) in [[1857]], which led to formation of a [[Sheffield & Hallamshire Football Association|Sheffield FA]] in 1867. In [[1862]], [[J. C. Thring|John Charles Thring]] of [[Uppingham School]] also devised an influential set of rules.<ref>{{cite web | title = The hands-off approach to a man's game | work = The Times | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,27-1544006,00.html | accessdate = 3 June | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref>

These efforts contributed to the formation of [[The Football Association]] (The FA) in [[1863]] which first met on the morning of [[26 October]] [[1863]] at the Freemason's Tavern in Great Queen Street, [[London]]<ref>{{cite web | title = History of the FA | work = Football Association website | url = http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/TheOrganisation/Postings/2004/03/HISTORY_OF_THE_FA.htm | accessdate = February 19 | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref>. The only school to be represented on this occasion was [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]. The Freemason's Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, who was the representative from [[Blackheath Rugby Club|Blackheath]], withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting, the first which allowed for the running with the ball in hand and the second, obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other [[History of rugby union|English rugby clubs followed this lead]] and did not join the FA but instead in [[1871]] formed the [[Rugby Football Union]]. The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of [[Ebenezer Cobb Morley]], went on to ratify the original fourteen rules of the game. Despite this, the Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s.

Today the laws of the game are determined by the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB). The Board was formed in [[1886]]<ref>{{cite web | title = The International FA Board | work = FIFA website | url = http://www.fifa.com/en/history/history/0,3504,3,00.html | accessdate = February 19 | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> after a meeting in [[Manchester]] of The Football Association, the [[Scottish Football Association]], the [[Football Association of Wales]], and the [[Irish Football Association]]. The world's oldest football competition is the [[FA Cup]], which has been contested by [[England|English]] teams since [[1872]]. England is also home to the world's first [[Football League|football league]], which was founded in [[1888]] by [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] director [[William McGregor]]<ref>{{cite web | title = The History Of The Football League | work = Football League website | url = http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10794,00.html | accessdate = April 19 | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref>. The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and the North of England. The F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association ([[FIFA]]), the international football body, was formed in [[Paris]] in [[1904]] and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association. <ref>{{cite web | title = History of FIFA | work = FIFA website | url = http://www.fifa.com/en/history/history/0,1283,4,00.html | accessdate = 3 June | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the IFAB in [[1913]]. The board currently consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.

Today, football is played at a professional level all over the world, and millions of people regularly go to football (soccer) [[stadium|stadia]] to follow their favourite team,<ref>[http://football.guardian.co.uk/news/theknowledge/0,9204,1059366,00.html Baseball or Football: which sport gets the higher attendance?], Guardian Unlimited.

Retrieved on [[May 13]], [[2006]].</ref> A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA and published in the spring of 2001, over 240 million people regularly play football in more than 200 countries in every part of the world.<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/en/media/index/0,1369,70583,00.html FIFA Survey: approximately 250 million footballers worldwide], FIFA official website. Retrieved on [[5 June]], [[2006]].</ref> Its simple rules and minimal equipment requirements have no doubt aided its spread and growth in popularity. 

In many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual [[Fan (aficionado)|fan]]s, local communities, and even nations; it is therefore often claimed to be the most popular sport in the world.   [[ESPN]] has spread the claim that the [[C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire national football team]] helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2005.  By contrast, however, football is widely considered to be the final proximate cause in the [[Football War]] in June 1969 between [[El Salvador]] and [[Honduras]].  The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning the [[Yugoslav wars]] of the 1990s, when a [[Red Star Belgrade]]-at-[[Dinamo Zagreb]] match devolved into rioting in March 1990.<ref>{{cite news | work=[[The Washington Post]] | title= The Soccer Wars | author = Daniel W.

== Laws of the Game ==
[[Image:Kid playing soccer.jpg|thumb|250px|Football is popular among children as well as adults.]]

===Overview of the Laws===
There are seventeen Laws in the official [[Laws of the Game]]. The same Laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors or women are permitted. The Laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. In addition to the seventeen Laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football. The Laws can be found on the official FIFA website.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fifa.com/en/regulations/regulation/0,3527,3,00.html| title=The Official web site of the F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association| accessdate=2006-04-19}}</ref>

=== Players, equipment and officials ===
{{seealso|Goalkeeper (football)|Substitute (football)}}
Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding [[substitute (football)|substitute]]s), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team; this is usually seven. The goalkeeper is the only player allowed to handle the ball with his hands or arms, but he is allowed to do so within the [[Penalty area (football)|penalty area]] in front of his own goal. Though there are a variety of [[Football (soccer) positions|positions]] in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a manager or coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.

The basic equipment players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards. Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player (including jewellery or watches). The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.

A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is three, though the number permitted may be varied in other leagues or in friendly matches. Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or to waste a little time at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in the match.

A game is officiated by a referee, who has "full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two [[assistant referee]]s. In many high-level games there is also a [[fourth official]], who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.

=== Playing field ===
{{main|Football pitch}}
[[Image:Football_pitch_imperial.svg|510px|thumb|center|Standard pitch measurements ([[:Image:Football pitch metric.svg|Metric version]])]]
{{-}}

Due to the original formulation of the Laws in England and the early supremacy of the four British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in [[imperial units]]. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate [[SI|metric]] equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though popular use tends to continue to use traditional units.

The length of the field (pitch) for international adult matches is in the range 100-110m (110-120 yards) and the width is in the range 65-75m (70-80 yards). The longer boundary lines are ''touchlines'' or ''sidelines'', while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are ''goal lines''. On the goal line at each end of the field is a goal. The inner edges of the goal posts must be 7.32m (8 yards) apart, and the lower edge of the crossbar must be 2.44m (8 feet) above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.

In front of each goal is an area of the field known as the [[penalty area]] (colloquially "penalty box", "18 yard box" or simply "the box"). This area is marked by the goal-line, two lines starting on the goal-line 16.5m (18 yards) from the goalposts and extending 18 yards into the pitch from the goal-line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penal foul by a defender becomes punishable by a [[penalty kick (football)|penalty kick]].

The field has other field markings and defined areas; these are described in the main article above.

=== Duration and tie-breaking methods ===
A standard adult football match consists of two periods (known as halves) of 45 minutes each. There is usually a 15-minute break between halves, known as half time. The end of the match is known as full-time.

The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention or other stoppages. This added time is commonly referred to as ''stoppage time'' or ''injury time''. The amount of time is at the sole discretion of the referee, and the referee alone signals when the match has been completed. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, towards the end of the half the referee will signal how many minutes remain to be played, and the fourth official then signals this to players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number.

In league competitions games may end in a draw, but in some knockout competitions if a game is tied at the end of regulation time it may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootouts]] (known officially in the Laws of the Game as "kicks from the penalty mark") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament. Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament (with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score).

Competitions held over two legs (in which each team plays at home once) may use the [[away goals rule]] to attempt to determine which team progresses in the event of an equal aggregate scoreline. If the result is still equal following this calculation kicks from the penalty mark are usually required, though some competitions may require a tied game to be replayed.

In the late [[1990s]], the IFAB experimented with ways of making matches more likely to end without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when the first goal in extra time was scored ([[golden goal]]), or if one team held a lead at the end of the first period of extra time ([[silver goal]]).  Golden goal was used at the World Cup in 2002 (Japan-South Korea) and the 1996 European Championships (Germany were the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition, beating Czech Republic in the final). Silver goal was used in Euro 2004 (Portugal). Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB.

=== Ball in and out of play ===
{{main|Ball in and out of play}}

Under the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are ''ball in play'' and ''ball out of play''. From the beginning of each playing period with a [[kick-off (football)|kick-off]] (a set kick from the centre-spot by one team) until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods, the method used depending on the reason for the ball going out of play:

[[Image:Directfreekick.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A [[direct free kick]] taken by the blue-white team.]]
* [[Kick-off (football)|Kick-off]]: following a goal by the opposing team, or to begin each period of play.
* [[Throw-in]]: when the ball has wholly crossed the touchline; awarded to opposing team to that which last touched the ball.
* [[Goal kick]]: when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by an attacker; awarded to defending team. 
* [[Corner kick]]: when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a defender; awarded to attacking team. 
* [[Indirect free kick]]: awarded to the opposing team following "non-penal" fouls, certain technical infringements, or when play is stopped to caution/send-off an opponent without a specific foul having occurred. 
* [[Direct free kick]]: awarded to fouled team following certain listed "penal" fouls. 
* [[Penalty kick (football)|Penalty kick]]: awarded to the fouled team following a "penal" foul occurring in their opponent's penalty area. 
* [[Dropped-ball]]: occurs when the referee has stopped play for any other reason (e.g. a serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective). This restart is uncommon in adult games.

===Fouls and misconduct===
{{seealso|Foul (football)|Misconduct (football)|Offside law (football)}}
{{double image|right|Yellow card.svg|60|Red card.svg|60|Players are cautioned with a yellow card, and sent off with a red card.}}

A [[foul (football)|foul]] occurs when a player commits a specific offence listed in the Laws of the Game when the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. "Penal fouls", for example handling the ball, tripping an opponent, pushing an opponent, etc, are punishable by a [[direct free kick]] or [[penalty kick (football)|penalty kick]] depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an [[indirect free kick]].

[[Misconduct (football)|Misconduct]] may occur at any time, and may be committed by both players and substitutes. Whilst the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of "unsporting behaviour" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. Misconduct may be punished by a caution ([[yellow card]]) or sending-off ([[red card]]).

The referee may allow play to continue <U+2014> i.e. not stop play <U+2014> when the team against which an offence has been committed will benefit from having play continue. This is known as "playing an advantage". The referee may "call back" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within a short period of time, typically taken to be four to five seconds. Even if an offence is not penalised due to application of the advantage clause, the offender may still be sanctioned for any associated misconduct at the next stoppage of play.

The most complex of the Laws is [[Offside law (football)|offside]]. The offside Law limits the ability of attacking players to remain forward (i.e. closer to the opponent's goal-line) of both the ball and the second last defending player. It is often assumed that the purpose of this Law is to prevent "goal scrounging" or "cherry picking", but in fact the offside law has similar roots to the offside Law in rugby.<ref>{{cite web | title = The History of Offside | work = Julian Carosi | url = http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/corshamref/sub/offhist.htm | accessdate = June 3 | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> The details and application of this Law are complex, and often result in controversy.

==Governing bodies==
The recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as [[futsal]] and [[beach soccer]]) is the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA). The FIFA headquarters are located in Zurich, Switzerland.

Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are:
* Asia: [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC)
* Africa: [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF)
* Central/North America & Caribbean: [[CONCACAF|Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football]] (CONCACAF; also known as The Football Confederation)
* Europe: [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] (UEFA)
* Oceania: [[Oceania Football Confederation]] (OFC)
* South America: [[CONMEBOL|Confederaci<U+00F3>n Sudamericana de F<U+00FA>tbol]] (South American Football Confederation; CONMEBOL)

The recognised various national associations (see [[football around the world]]) oversee football within their jurisdictions. These are affiliated both with FIFA directly and also with their respective continental confederations.

Note that the Laws of the Game are not maintained by FIFA itself; rather they are maintained by the [[International Football Association Board]], as discussed in the [[#history and development|history and development section]] above.

== Major international competitions ==

The major international competition in football is the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], organised by FIFA. This competition takes place over a four-year period. Over 190 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament, which is held every four years, now involves 32 national teams (increased from 24 in [[1998]]) competing over a four-week period. The [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] takes place in Germany 2006<ref>{{cite web | title = FIFA World Cup 2006 | work = FIFA World Cup 2006 website | url = http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/ | accessdate = February 19 | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> and then in 2010 it will be held in [[South Africa]].

There has been a [[Football at the Summer Olympics|football tournament]] at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] since [[1900]], except at the [[1932]] games in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Prior to the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) had the same status of the World Cup. Originally, the event was for amateurs only,<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/en/history/history/0,1283,4,00.html Where it all began] FIFA official website. Retrieved on April 10, 2006.</ref> however, since the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] professionals have been permitted as well, albeit with certain restrictions which effectively prevent countries from fielding their strongest sides. Currently, the Olympic men's tournament is played at Under-23 level with a restricted number of over-age players per team;<ref>{{cite web | title = Football - An Olympic Sport since 1900 | work = IOC website | url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/index_uk.asp?SportCode=FB | accessdate = June 5 | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> consequently the competition is not generally considered to carry the same international significance and prestige as the World Cup. A women's tournament was added in [[1996]]; in contrast to the men's event, the women's Olympic tournament is played by full international sides without age restrictions. It thus carries international prestige considered comparable to that of the [[FIFA Women's World Cup]].

After the World Cup, the most important football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the [[European Football Championship|European Championship]] (UEFA), the [[Copa Am<U+00E9>rica]] (CONMEBOL), [[African Cup of Nations]] (CAF), the [[Asian Cup]] (AFC), the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] (CONCACAF) and the [[OFC Nations Cup]] (OFC).  The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example the [[UEFA Champions League]] in [[Europe]] and the [[Copa Libertadores de Am<U+00E9>rica|Copa Libertadores]] in [[South America]].

==Domestic competitions==
The governing bodies in each country operate [[league system|league]]s, themselves normally comprised of several [[division (sport)|division]]s, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into [[table (information)|table]]s, placing them in order according to points accrued. Generally, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season.  At the end of a season, the top team are declared to be the champions, and the top few teams may be promoted to a higher division; and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division. The teams finishing at the top of a country's league may be eligible also to play in international club competitions in the following season. The main exceptions to this system occur in some [[South America|South American]] leagues, which divide football championships into two sections named [[Apertura and Clausura]], awarding a champion for each.

In addition to a league system, most countries operate one or more ''cup'' competitions during the season.  These are organised on a knock-out basis, i.e. the winner of each match proceeds to the next round; the loser takes no further part in the competition. For a full list of the most important football competitions in each country, see [[football (soccer) around the world]].

The rules of football were codified in England by the Football Association in [[1863]], and the name ''association football'' was coined to distinguish the game from the [[Football|other forms of football]] played at the time, specifically [[rugby football]]. The term ''soccer'' first appeared in the [[1880s]] as a slang abbreviation of Association football, often credited to [[Charles Wreford-Brown]]. <ref>{{cite web | title = The World's Most Beloved Sport - The History of Soccer | work = fussballportal.de | url = http://germany2006.fussballportal.de/history.php | accessdate = 3 June | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref>

Today the sport is known by a number of names throughout the English-speaking world, the most common being ''football'' and ''soccer''. The term used depends largely on the need to differentiate the sport from other codes of football followed in a community. ''Football'' is the term used by FIFA, the sport's world governing body, and the [[International Olympic Committee]]. For more details of naming throughout the world, please refer to the main articles above.
