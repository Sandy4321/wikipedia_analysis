'''Apolo Anton Ohno''' ({{IPA-en|<U+0259><U+02C8>p<U+0252>lo<U+028A> <U+02C8><U+00E6>nt<U+0252>n <U+02C8>o<U+028A>no<U+028A>|pron}}; born May 22, 1982) is an [[United States|American]] [[short track speed skating]] competitor and an eight-time medalist (two gold, two silver, four bronze) in the [[Winter Olympics]]. He is the most decorated American Winter Olympic athlete of all time.

Raised by his father, Ohno began training full-time in 1996.  He has been the face of short track in the United States since winning his medals at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]].<ref name="popular1"/><ref name="hollywood"/>  At the age of 14, he became the youngest U.S. national champion in 1997 and was the reigning champion from 2001<U+2013>2009, winning the title a total of 12 times.<ref name="familylife"/><ref name="NBC Olympics"/>  In December 1999, he became the youngest skater to win a World Cup event title, and became the first American to win a [[Short Track Speed Skating World Cup|World Cup overall]] title in 2001, which he won again in 2003 and 2005.<ref name="NBC Olympics">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/athletes/athlete=2173/bio/index.html |title=Apolo Ohno Vancouver Olympics Profile |accessdate=2009-08-13 |publisher=NBC Olympics}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title=Ohno Wins 1,500 Short-Track Title | date=1999-12-19 | url =http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19991219&slug=3002427 | work =The Seattle Times | accessdate = 2009-12-22}}</ref>  He won his first overall World Championship title at the [[2008 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships|2008 championships]].

During the 2002 Winter Olympics, there were two controversies associated with Ohno.  The first was whether or not he intentionally finished third in a qualification race during the U.S. Olympic Trials to allow [[Shani Davis]] to make the team.  The second occurred when he won the gold medal in the 1500&nbsp;m race after the disqualification of the first skater to cross the finish line, South Korean [[Kim Dong-Sung]], for blocking Ohno.  The disqualification upset South Korean supporters and had a lingering negative effect on Ohno's reputation in South Korea.

Ohno's accolades and accomplishments include being the [[United States Olympic Committee]]'s Male Athlete of the Month in October 2003 and March 2008, the U.S. Speedskating's Athlete of the Year for 2003, and was a 2002, 2003 and 2006 finalist for the [[James E.

==Early life==
Ohno was born in [[Federal Way, Washington]], to a [[Japanese people|Japanese]]-born father, {{Nihongo|Yuki Ohno|<U+5927><U+91CE> <U+5E78>|''<U+014C>no Yuki''}} and a Caucasian-American mother, Jerrie Lee.<ref name="decision">{{Cite news| first=Percy | last=Allen | title=Fed.

When Ohno was very young, his father meticulously researched [[Day care|childcare]] providers to care for his son during his long work hours.<ref name="book1315"/> As he grew older, his father became concerned his son would become a [[latchkey kid]], so he got his son involved with competitive swimming and quad-speed roller skating at age 6, and later [[Inline speed skating]], to fill his spare time.<ref name="familylife">{{Cite news| first=Elliot | last=Almond | title=Winter Olympic Profile / Apolo Ohno <U+2013> Completing A Family Circle | date=1998-01-15 | url =http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19980115&slug=2728777 | work =The Seattle Times | accessdate = 2009-12-22}}</ref> Ohno's days were spent with morning swimming practices, followed by schooling, and finally skating practices in the afternoon.<ref name="book2223">Ohno & Richardson 2002, pp. 22<U+2013>23.</ref>

When Ohno was 12, he won the Washington state championship in the [[breaststroke]] but preferred inline speed skating over swimming.<ref name="book2223"/> He has stated that by the time he turned 13 years of age he attended parties with older teenagers if he did not have competitions on the weekends.<ref>Ohno & Richardson 2002, p. 19.</ref> His father has stated that it was a struggle balancing his son's desire for independence while helping him reach his potential as a young athlete.<ref name="familylife"/>

==Career==
===Beginnings===
When he was 12 years old, Ohno became interested in [[short track speed skating]] after seeing the sport during the [[1994 Olympics]] in [[Lillehammer]].<ref name=GMA>{{Cite news| first=Ron | last=Claiborne | title=Apolo Ohno Has a Single Father Behind His Success| date=2006-06-18 | url =http://www.abcnews.go.com/GMA/ESPNSports/story?id=2090015&page=1 | publisher =ABC News | accessdate = 2008-04-11}}</ref>  His father capitalized on this interest by driving him to short track competitions throughout the Northwest United States and Canada, and Ohno won several competitions in his age divisions.<ref name="decision"/><ref name=SI/>  His father wanted to encourage Ohno to develop his skills and, although Ohno was underage, he got him admitted to the [[Lake Placid Olympic Training Center]] in 1996 to train full-time for short track.<ref name="SI" />  At 13 years of age, Ohno was the youngest skater admitted to the center.<ref name="familylife"/>

At first, Ohno's commitment at Lake Placid was low until his teammates nicknamed him "Chunky", which motivated him to train harder.<ref name="decision"/> In January, he failed to make the 1997 U.S. Junior World Team.<ref>Ohno & Richardson 2002, p. 46.</ref> Ohno adjusted his training and made a comeback winning the 1997 U.S. Senior Championships overall title, taking a gold medal in the 1500&nbsp;m, a silver in the 300&nbsp;m, and came in fourth in the 500&nbsp;m races.<ref name="familylife"/><ref name="book">Ohno & Richardson 2002, pp. 48<U+2013>52.</ref> At the age of 14, he became the youngest person to win the title.<ref name="familylife"/>  Ohno then relocated to the [[United States Olympic Training Center|Colorado Springs Olympic Training Center]] to begin training with the senior level skaters, despite being only 14&nbsp;years old.<ref name="book"/>

However, Ohno would struggle at the 1997 World Championships in [[Nagano]], [[Japan]], finishing 19th overall.<ref name="book"/> After this disappointing defeat at his first appearance at a world championships, Ohno returned home to Seattle.<ref name="book"/> He did not train from April to August 1997, so he gained weight and was ill-prepared for the [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Nagano Winter Olympics]].<ref name="book"/> As a result, he finished last in the Olympic trials and did not qualify for the Olympic team.<ref name=SI/> Because of his losses at the World Championships and his failure to qualify for the Olympic team, Ohno recommitted himself to the sport and returned to junior-level skating at Lake Placid, rather than at Colorado Springs.<ref name="book"/>

At the 1999 World Junior Championships, Ohno won first overall, placing first in the 1000&nbsp;m and 1500&nbsp;m, and winning silver in the 500&nbsp;m.<ref name="yahoo profile" /> He won his second senior U.S. national championship in 1999. He finished fourth overall at the [[1999 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships|1999 World Championships]] and earned a silver medal in the 500&nbsp;m.<ref name="yahoo profile" /> At the 2000 U.S. Championships, Ohno was unable to defend his title and finished third overall.<ref name="yahoo profile" /> At the [[2000 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships|2000 World Championships]], Ohno finished ninth overall.<ref name="yahoo profile" /> In the 2000&ndash;2001 season, Ohno won his first World Cup overall title, regained his National title, and finished second overall in the [[2001 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships|World Championships]], losing to Chinese skater [[Li Jiajun]].<ref name="yahoo profile" /><ref>Ohno & Richardson 2002, pp. 91<U+2013>94.</ref>

====Qualification race controversy====
In December 2001, during the U.S. Short Track Speed Skating 2002 Olympic Trials, speed skater [[Shani Davis]] was racing for a position on the short track team.  Ohno and fellow skater [[Rusty Smith]] had already earned slots on the six-man team due to points earned from earlier races. In order for Davis to qualify, he had to place first in the final race&mdash;the 1000&nbsp;m&mdash;by overcoming stronger skaters Ohno, Smith, and Ron Biondo.<ref name="Cazeneuve">{{Cite news| first=Brian | last=Cazeneuve | title=More on the great short-track speed skating controversy | date=2002-02-13 | url =http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2002/news/2002/02/13/cazeneuve_ohno/ | work =Sports Illustrated | accessdate = 2009-06-09 }}</ref> Since Ohno had been dominant in the meet to this point by winning every race he entered, a win by Davis seemed to be unlikely.

Though Ohno, Smith and Biondo were heavily favored to win the 1000&nbsp;m, the race ended with Ohno finishing third, Smith second, and Davis at the top of the podium.  Prior to crossing the finish line, Ohno started celebrating for Davis and Smith.<ref name="Cazeneuve" />  Davis' first-place finish earned enough points to move past Tommy O'Hare in the final point standings and to qualify for sixth place.  By finishing second, Smith earned the opportunity to skate individually in the 1000&nbsp;m.  The victory celebration was short-lived as rumors began that Ohno and Smith, both good friends of Davis, intentionally threw the race so Davis would win.<ref name=SI/>

After returning to [[Colorado Springs]], O'Hare, who did not skate in the 1000&nbsp;m, filed a formal complaint. The complaint was founded on Ohno's seemingly deliberate attempt to stop Biondo from being able to pass Smith.<ref name="complaint">{{Cite news| first=Selena | last=Roberts | title=OLYMPICS; Fix charge is a threat to skater Ohno | date=2002-01-22 | url =http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/22/sports/olympics-fix-charge-is-a-threat-to-skater-ohno.html | work =The New York Times | accessdate = 2009-06-09}}</ref>  Because of that blocking move on Biondo, Smith finished in second place and Davis finished first.<ref name="complaint"/>  For three days, Ohno, Smith, and Davis stood before an arbitration panel of the United States Olympic Committee.<ref name="Cazeneuve" />  During the hearing, Davis was never accused of being at fault and Smith made the statement: "Any allegation that there was a fix, conspiracy or understanding between Apolo and me, or anyone else, to let Shani win the race is completely false. Shani is a great athlete, skated a great race, and deserves to be on the team."<ref name="complaint"/>  The final verdict was that O'Hare's claims went unproven, all three were absolved of guilt, and the claim was dismissed.<ref name="dismissed">{{Cite news| first=Ron | last=Judd | title=Ohno cleared of fixing U.S. trials | date=2002-01-25 | url =http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020125&slug=ohno25 | work =The Seattle Times | accessdate = 2009-06-09}}</ref>  After the dismissal, Ohno stated, "I am thrilled that the arbitration process has officially vindicated me.... As I've said since the moment of these accusations, they were untrue and I did nothing wrong".<ref name="dismissed" />

The South Korean team immediately protested the decision of the chief official of the race, but their protests were denied by the [[International Skating Union|International Skating Union (ISU)]].<ref name="disqualified"/><ref name="sportslaw2002"/><ref name="protestDQ"/> The Korean team then appealed to the [[International Olympic Committee|International Olympic Committee (IOC)]] and the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport|Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS)]].<ref name="disqualified"/><ref name="sportslaw2002"/>  The IOC refused to see the case, stating, "This is a matter for the ISU to decide on.

The disqualification upset South Korean supporters, many of whom directed their anger at Ohno and the [[International Olympic Committee]].
