The '''Stonehenge road tunnel''' was a controversial [[tunnel]] in [[Wiltshire]], [[England]] proposed by the [[Highways Agency]] to upgrade the [[A303 road]].  It would have moved the A303 into a tunnel under the [[Stonehenge]] [[World Heritage Site]] and close the [[A344 road]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/8311.aspx |title=Reasons for Review |publisher=Highways Agency |accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> The project was designed to improve the landscape around the monument and to improve safety on the [[primary status|primary]] A303<ref name="ha">{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/3659.aspx |title=A303 Stonehenge |publisher=Highways Agency |accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> and was part of [[Recent history of Stonehenge#Development controversies|proposals]] to change the site in other ways including moving the visitors centre.

==Context==
The A303 is one of the main routes from [[London]] to the [[South West England|South West of England]].  Sections have been upgraded to [[dual carriageway]] status, though sections of the route remain single carriageway.  Traffic flows on the A303 between [[Amesbury]] and [[Winterbourne Stoke]] (the section including Stonehenge) are above the capacity of the road<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/6382.aspx |title=A303 Stonehenge (incorporating the Winterbourne Stoke Bypass) Preferred Route Announcement June 1999 <U+2014> Why a road improvement is proposed |publisher=Highways Agency |accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> and the Highways Agency expressed concern about safety on this road and the A344.<ref name="ha" />  The two roads currently pass through Stonehenge and land owned by the National Trust<ref name="report">{{cite web |url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/network/strategic/programme/decisionletters/coll_reportofthelocalinquiryinto/reportofthelocalinquiryintot3987 |title=Report to the First Secretary of State and the Secretary of State for Transport |pages=p8 s2.9 |date=2005-01-31 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-07-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070206194011/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/network/strategic/programme/decisionletters/coll_reportofthelocalinquiryinto/reportofthelocalinquiryintot3987 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-06}}</ref> with the A303 passing directly south and the A344 directly to the north with a pedestrian tunnel passing from the Stonehenge visitor centre to the site underneath this road.  As part of the development of the proposals, over 50 routes were considered by the Highways Agency.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/6381.aspx |title=A303 Stonehenge (incorporating the Winterbourne Stoke Bypass) Preferred Route Announcement June 1999 <U+2014> Choice of route |publisher=Highways Agency |accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref>

Since 1991 51 proposals have been considered for improving the A303 in the area and to remove it from the Stonehenge site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org.uk/UserFiles/File/UKNC_Stonehenge_042006.pdf |title=A303 Stonehenge Improvement Scheme Review: public consultation <U+2014> Response by the United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO |accessdate=2007-05-17 |author=Professor Alec Boksenberg CBE FRS |date=2006-04-19 |format=PDF |publisher=UNESCO Committee for United Kingdom |pages=Page 2}}</ref>

==Proposals==

===1995 proposal===
In 1995 it was proposed to build a tunnel for the A303 underneath the World Heritage Site.<ref name="enquirybegins">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/3493649.stm |title=Stonehenge tunnel inquiry opens |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2004-02-17 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> A conference agreed on a 2.5 mile (4km) [[tunnel|bored tunnel]], however the [[United Kingdom government|government]] instead proposed a [[cut and cover]] tunnel, with plans being published in 1999.<ref name="enquirybegins" /> These plans were criticised by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], [[Transport 2000]] and others who expressed concern that it would cause damage to archaeological remains along the route, destroy ancient sites and not achieve an improvement in the landscape.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1606053.stm |title=Stonehenge road plans 'may damage site' |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2001-10-18 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2299033.stm |title=Trust attacks Stonehenge tunnel |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2002-10-04 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref>

In 2002, new plans for a bored tunnel of 1.3 miles (2.1km) were announced by the [[Secretary of State for Transport]] as part of a 7.7 mile (12.5km) plan to upgrade the A303 to dual carriageway status, with the tunnel estimated to cost [[<U+00A3>]]183m.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2562675.stm |title=Stonehenge tunnel approved |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2002-12-10 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref>  This proposal brought further protests from the National Trust, [[English Heritage]], [[UNESCO]], [[CPRE]], the [[Council for British Archaeology]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/stonehenge/Stonehenge%20roads%20inquiry%20final%20proof.doc |title=Proof of Evidence of George Lambrick MA FSA MIFA |publisher=Council for British Archaeology |format=DOC |date=2004-01-?? |accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref>  and local groups as the tunnel approach cutting would cut in two a prehistoric track way between Stonehenge and a nearby river. These groups are calling for a tunnel at least 2.9 km long, which would, while being sited within the world heritage site, clear most of the known major artefacts, claiming that if the government goes ahead with the 2.1 km tunnel there may never be another chance to remove the road from the site completely. <ref>{{cite press release| title = Maximising benefits <U+2013> A more sustainable tunnel solution at Stonehenge |publisher=The National Trust  | date = 3 October 200 |url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/webpack/bin/webpack.exe/livebase?object=LiveBase1&itemurn=1247&mode=wbFullItem |accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref> 

In 2004 a [[public enquiry]] required under the [[Highways Act 1980]] was conducted by a planning inspector, Michael Ellison.  His enquiry agreed that the government proposals were adequate.<ref name="report"/>  The report stated:

{{cquote|The physical loss of archaeological remains, the changes to the land form in these sections, and the scale of the new highway would adversely affect the authenticity of the site and more than offset the benefits of the proposed tunnel in the central area. The published scheme would represent the largest earthwork ever constructed within the World Heritage Site; a feature that would contribute nothing to the authenticity.}}

but concluded:

{{cquote|...after taking into account the requirements of local and national planning, including the requirements of agriculture, that it is expedient for the purpose of improving the A303 between points A and B on the plan referred to in the Line Order for a trunk road to be provided along the route shown in the Line Order}}

On 20 July 2005 the tunnel scheme was withdrawn by the Government, partly due to rising costs of construction, which had doubled to <U+00A3>470 million.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/4699477.stm |title= Stonehenge tunnel plan cash blow |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2005-07-20 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> The Highways Agency continued to list the project as planned, but gave 2008 as the earliest date for the start of construction.<ref name="ha" />

===2005 proposal===
On 31 October 2005 a Government steering group was set up to look at possible solutions,<ref>{{cite press release |title= Way Forward Announced For A303 Stonehenge Review |publisher=Government News Network |date= 2005-10-31 |url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/environment/fullDetail.asp?ReleaseID=175616&NewsAreaID=2&NavigatedFromDepartment=False |accessdate=2007-04-08 |quote=Stephen Ladyman, Minister of State for Transport, said: "I hope this review will enable me to decide on an option in keeping with the special requirements of the location that is affordable, realistic and deliverable."}}</ref> with the aim of choosing an "option in keeping with the special requirements of the location that is affordable, realistic and deliverable." 
The review presented five options <U+2014> the published tunnel scheme, a cut and cover tunnel, a 'partial solution' (involving a roundabout but maintaining the current road), and two overland bypass routes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/4694894.stm |title=Heritage site road plans revealed |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2006-02-08 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/Stonehenge_Leaflet_web_version.pdf |title=A303 Stonehenge Improvement Scheme Review <U+2014> Public Consultation |publisher=Highways Agency |format=PDF |date=2006-01 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> Some of these plans have been criticised as being damaging to both archaeology and [[biodiversity]], including the [[stone curlew]], [[barn owl]]s, [[bat]]s, and the chalk grassland habitat.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/4637656.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |title=Stonehenge road 'a risk to birds' |date=2006-01-23 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref>Five options were considered including diverting the A303 further away and only closing the A344.The group expected to produced a report in 2006, taking into account the results of public consultation which started in 23 January 2006 and ran until 24 April 2006.<ref name="ha" />

On 6 December 2007 [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport|Roads Minister]] [[Tom Harris (UK politician)|Tom Harris]] announced that the whole scheme had been cancelled due to increased costs of <U+00A3>540 million.  English Heritage expressed disappointment whilst Save Stonehenge were pleased with the outcome. The Highways Agency will continue to work on small scale improvements to the A303.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/7130666.stm |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC News |title=Stonehenge tunnel plans scrapped |date=2007-12-06 |accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref>

===A334 closure===
A revised proposal, of closing the A344 road between Stonehenge Bottom and Byway 12, and closing part of the B3086 was put forward in 2010. This also includes a proposed new roundabout to replace the current Airman's Corner junction and improvements to the Longbarow Roundabout on the A303.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salisburyjournal.co.uk/news/9097436.Public_inquiry_into_Stonehenge_road_closure/     |title=Public inquiry into Stonehenge road closure |publisher=Salisbury Journal |date=22 June 2011  |accessdate=12 August 2011}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bajrfed.co.uk/showthread.php?2771-Stonehenge-Road-Closure |title=Stonehenge Road Closure  |publisher=BAJR archaeology portal  |date=February 2010  |accessdate=12 August 2011}}</ref>

A planning inquiry to consider the proposal was started in June 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-13863143  |title=Inquiry into Stonehenge A344 closure plans |publisher=BBC |date=22 June 2011  |accessdate=12 August 2011}}</ref> In July 2012 work officially began on a <U+00A3>27m project which involves the closure and grassing over of A344 and the underpass beneath the road filled in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/jul/11/stonehenge-27-million-makeover-a344|title=Stonehenge's <U+00A3>27m makeover will end its days as a traffic island |publisher=The Guardian |date=11 July 2012  |accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref>

===2013 proposal?===
According to documentation released in response to a Freedom of Information request, in January 2012 local councils and the South West Local Enterprise Partnership met to discuss their proposals for "''a consortium of Local Authorities to develop and take forward a new scheme for improvements to the A303/ A358/A30''" and to "''develop an effective lobbying framework so that we can take a planned approach to raising our profile both nationally, regionally and locally''".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/101507/response/257007/attach/3/ENV%20767%20Rebecca%20Lush%20Blum%20Reply%20attachment%20A303%20Meeting%206%20January%202012.pdf|title=Notes of a meeting to discuss opportunities to take forward a new proposal for improvements to the A303, A358 and A30}}</ref> In September 2012 a survey conducted by Somerset County Counci found that more than 90% of commuters and businesses in the South West back an upgrade of the A303.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19615859|title=A303 dualling plan through South West 'supported by businesses'}}</ref> In April 2013 it was reported that the chancellor was giving consideration to "''adding lanes to the A303 <U+2013> known all too well to holidaymakers <U+2013> which runs from Basingstoke through Somerset (past Stonehenge)''".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chancellor-plans-second-toll-motorway-in-major-road-spend-8556198.html|title=Chancellor plans second toll motorway in major road spend|work=The Independent|date=2013-04-01}}</ref>
