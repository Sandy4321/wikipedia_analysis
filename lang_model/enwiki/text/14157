'''BJ<U+2019>s Restaurants, Inc.''' is a chain of deep dish [[pizza]] [[restaurant]]s in the [[United States]] first opened under the '''BJ<U+2019>s Chicago Pizzeria''' name in 1978 in [[Santa Ana, California]]. Due to its popularity, new BJ<U+2019>s restaurants were opened in beach cities along [[Southern California]]<U+2019>s coastline. In 1996, with seven restaurants in operation from [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] to [[Los Angeles]], the first BJ<U+2019>s brewery began production in the [[Brea, California]] store. The chain was then renamed to "BJ<U+2019>s Restaurants, Inc."

One of BJ's unique dishes is the "''pizookie''" (from ''pizza cookie''), a [[dessert]] consisting of [[cookie dough]] baked in deep dish pizza pans, served hot and topped with [[vanilla]] bean [[ice cream]].
