"'''Masterpiece'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for the soundtrack of the 2012 film ''[[W.E.]]''. The song was later included on her twelfth studio album ''[[MDNA (album)|MDNA]]'' (2012). It was released as a radio single in the United Kingdom on April 2, 2012, to promote the album. The song was composed by Madonna, [[Julie Frost]] and [[Jimmy Harry]] and produced by Madonna and [[William Orbit]]. It garnered critical acclaim from contemporary critics, who praised its lyrical content and Madonna's vocal performance.

The song won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]] at the [[69th Golden Globe Awards]], but was ineligible for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] at the [[84th Academy Awards]]. Its Golden Globe nomination sparked a [[red carpet]] rivalry between herself and singer  [[Elton John]]. "Masterpiece" became a moderate success, topping the airplay chart of Russia, while reaching the lower regions of the charts in the Czech Republic, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom. "Masterpiece" was performed by Madonna on her 2012 [[MDNA Tour]], where she was accompanied by [[Basque music|Basque musicians]] [[Kalakan (band)|Kalakan trio]]. The performance of the song was considered a highlight of the tour.

== Writing and development ==
"Masterpiece" was composed by Madonna, [[Julie Frost]] and [[Jimmy Harry]] and produced by Madonna and [[William Orbit]].<ref name="gg"/> When Madonna was directing her film ''[[W.E.]]'', her manager [[Guy Oseary]] persuaded the singer to compose a song for the soundtrack.<ref name="gg"/> Frost was living in Los Angeles at that time and was assessing her priorities in the music world, and wanted to collaborate with a number of artists, Madonna being the first.<ref name="wbez"/> "She is an icon", Frost said, "But most importantly she has some of the best Pop songs in the history of music... so yeah its always a dream to work with people like her."<ref name="wbez"/> Orbit, who was working with Frost and Harry on an assignment, contacted them for collaborating with Madonna on "Masterpiece".<ref>{{cite episode|last=Williams|first=Colleen|date=2012-02-01|title=Nonstop News LA|network=[[Cozi TV|NBC Nonstop]]|city=Los Angeles|minutes=1:51<U+2013>3:23|time=15:30}}</ref> He had heard Frost's initial composition of the song and knew that Madonna would love it.<ref name="epk">{{cite video|people=[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]|title=Madonna <U+2013> MDNA Electronic Press Kit Featuring William Orbit, Martin Solveig, Benny Benassi|time=6:31<U+2013>7:00|publisher=Interscope Records|format=Streaming, Digital download|year=2012}}</ref> According to Frost the theme explained to them was about bittersweet love and the hardships felt being in a relationship. Madonna, Frost and Harry sat together with this idea and brainstormed and came up with the lyrics and the melody. Over time, Madonna changed the structure of the song and the final version was ready for recording.<ref name="wbez">{{cite news|url=http://www.wbez.org/episode-segments/2012-02-06/julie-frost-talks-about-golden-globe-winning-collaboration-madonna-96142|title=Julie Frost talks about Golden Globe-winning collaboration with Madonna|author=Eight Forty-Eight|date=2012-02-06|accessdate=2013-03-22|publisher=[[WBEZ]]|location=[[Chicago, Illinois]]}}</ref><ref name="epk"/> Madonna recalled: 
{{quote|"[Guy Oseary] harangued me for the entire time I was filming and editing my movie to write a song. And I said, 'Please, Guy, I'm trying to focus on being a director and I want people to pay attention to the film and I don't have time.' So then I finished the film and I started making [[MDNA (album)|my record]] and somehow magically and miraculously the song emerged, 'Masterpiece,' so thank you, Guy Oseary, for being so irritating."<ref name="gg"/>

In "Masterpiece", Madonna sings about the pain of being in love with someone who is a great work of art, with the lyrics including "If you were the [[Mona Lisa]], You'd be hanging in the [[Mus<U+00E9>e du Louvre|Louvre]], Everyone would come to see you, You'd be impossible to move."<ref name=MUHM>{{cite web|url=http://idolator.com/6100542/madonna-unveils-her-masterpiece|title=Madonna Unveils Her 'Masterpiece'|date=2011-12-03|accessdate=2011-12-05|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]. [[Buzz Media]]}}</ref> Madonna said the song describes [[Wallis Simpson]] and is "about a woman who has fallen in love with this untouchable thing, this man that was raised to be king. One of the lines of the song 'it must be so hard to always be the chosen one.' At the end of the day nothing is indestructible, no matter how high you might rise in the world you are still a human being."<ref name="yahoo"/> Marc Schneider from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' described "Masterpiece" as a slowed-down, moody ballad that showcases strong execution of vocals from Madonna. He described the [[Sound recording and reproduction|production]] as "simple, direct and reminiscent of her sound in the 1990s". The lyrics were described as emotional, and was comparable to the film's love story, with the [[refrain|chorus]] as follows: "And I'm right by your side, Like a thief in the night, I stand in front of a masterpiece. And I can't tell you why it hurts so much to be in love with a masterpiece. 'Cause after all, nothing's indestructible".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/464716/madonna-trent-reznor-land-golden-globe-nominations|title=Madonna's 'W.E.'
