'''New York State Route 9A''' is a [[state highway]] in [[New York]], [[United States]], providing an alternate to [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US 9]] from [[New York City]] north to [[Peekskill (NY)|Peekskill]]. In New York City, it is a major route of its own, running along the [[West Side Highway]] and [[Henry Hudson Parkway]]. In [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], NY 9A follows the '''Briarcliff-Peekskill Parkway'''.

Route 9A begins in [[lower Manhattan]] at the north end of the [[Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel]] ([[Interstate 478]]) and heads north on the surface [[West Side Highway]] and [[freeway]]-standard [[Henry Hudson Parkway]], crossing [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US 9]] for the first time at the east end of the [[George Washington Bridge]]. After crossing into [[the Bronx]] via the [[Henry Hudson Bridge]], 9A proceeds to leave the parkway at exit 23, joining 9 on Broadway.<ref>{{cite map|title=2008 Road Atlas|publisher=[[American Map]]|page=80}}</ref> The 9/9A concurrency runs for 2.87 miles within the city of [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]].<ref name=dot />

The second 9/9A concurrency runs for 0.65 mile (1 km), with 9A leaving the Croton Expressway at Croton Point Avenue in [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York|Croton-on-Hudson]].

==History==
Prior to the 1927 [[U.S. Highway System]], US 9 was [[New York State Route 6 (1924)|Route 6]]. An alternate route from [[Yonkers (NY)|Yonkers]] to [[Tarrytown (NY)|Tarrytown]] was assigned the number '''Route 6A'''. This ran along the present alignment of Route 9A from Yonkers to north of [[Elmsford (NY)|Elmsford]], where it turned west on Saw Mill Road, Neperan Road, County House Road and Bedford Road to end at Route 6 in Tarrytown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewYork/NewYorkCity/unitedstates1926ra_078.html|title=Rand McNally Auto Road Atlas, 1926 edition|accessdate=2007-09-06}}</ref>

In the [[1930 renumbering]], Route 6A was renumbered to Route 9A.<ref name=gb>''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1930/31 and 1931/32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930/31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]]</ref> It was extended south to the [[Holland Tunnel]] in [[New York City]] in mid-December [[1934]], along with the marking of other numbered routes in New York City.<ref name="nyt34">{{cite news|title=Mark Ways in the City|work=[[New York Times]]|date=[[1934-12-16]]}}</ref> The 1933 plan, compiled by the [[New York Automobile Club]], had taken US 9 to the tunnel<ref name="nyt33">{{cite news|title=Routes Through New York City|work=[[New York Times]]|date=[[1933-11-12]]}}</ref> (in 1932 it would have continued south via the [[Staten Island Ferry]]<ref name="nyt32">{{cite news|title=Through Routes Mapped|work=[[New York Times]]|date=[[1932-03-20]]}}</ref>), but the final plan took US 9 over the [[George Washington Bridge]] into New Jersey, with Route 9A taking over what was to be US 9.<ref name="nyt34" />

[[Image:NY 9A in 1938.jpg|thumb|left|Tarrytown, including US 9 and NY 9A, in 1938.]]
The 1932 plan took Route 9A south through [[the Bronx]] and into [[Manhattan]] on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] (US 9 would have used [[Riverdale Avenue (Bronx)|Riverdale Avenue]] north of [[230th Street (Bronx)|230th Street]], resulting in a short [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] across [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]]). It would have split to the south on [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Tenth Avenue]] at [[218th Street (Manhattan)|218th Street]] in order to join the [[Harlem River Drive]] via [[Nagle Avenue (Manhattan)|Nagle Avenue]] and [[Dyckman Street (Manhattan)|Dyckman Street]]. From there it would head west on [[155th Street (Manhattan)|155th Street]] to [[Amsterdam Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]], where it would head south to [[79th Street (Manhattan)|79th Street]], heading west there to rejoin US 9 at [[Riverside Drive (New York)|Riverside Drive]]. (It is unclear whether Route 9A would have continued south with US 9 to [[lower Manhattan]].)<ref name="nyt32" /> The 1933 plan made no changes to Route 9A, though US 9 was changed to use Broadway all the way through the Bronx.<ref name="nyt33" />

In the final plan, however, no route was assigned to the Harlem River Drive-Amsterdam Avenue corridor. Instead, Route 9A used what had been planned as US 9, splitting at [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and [[Dyckman Street (Manhattan)|Dyckman Street]]. Route 9A ran south along the west side of Manhattan on [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] and the [[West Side Highway]] (detouring around an unfinished section via [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]], [[Eleventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Eleventh Avenue]] and [[48th Street (Manhattan)|48th Street]]) to end at the entrance and exit plazas of the [[Holland Tunnel]].<ref name="nyt34" />

As the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]] replaced [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] in the 1930s, Route 9A was moved onto it, eventually using the new parkway to the crossing with US 9 (Broadway) in the Bronx, where it continued to exit and run [[concurrent (road)|concurrent]] with US 9 to the split in [[Yonkers (NY)|Yonkers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewYork/NewYorkCity/randmcnally_ra_1946_040.html|title=Rand McNally Road Atlas, 1946 edition|accessdate=2007-09-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/history/1941_metro-4/|title=New York 1941 (Bronx-Westchester)|accessdate=2007-09-06}}</ref> At the other end, an extension of [[Saw Mill River Road]] and the Briarcliff-Peekskill Parkway ran around [[Ossining (NY)|Ossining]] to US 9 north of that village. Completed in 1933,<ref name="NBI">[[National Bridge Inventory]], a database compiled by the [[United States Department of Transportation]] [[Federal Highway Administration]], available at www.nationalbridges.com. Accessed [[2007-09-06]].</ref> it was initially designated as '''Route 404''', and became a realignment and extension of Route 9A between 1947 and 1951.<ref>{{cite map |title=Official Highway Map of New York State |publisher=[[State of New York Department of Public Works]] |edition=1947-48 |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite map|publisher=[[Mobil]]gas|title=Miracle Fold Road Map, New Jersey, Delaware, and the Chesapeake Bay Area|edition=|year=1951|cartography=[[Rand McNally]]}}</ref> An extension prior to 1941 had taken it north from Peekskill on Sleepy Hollow Road, rejoining US 9 between Tarrytown and Ossining.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/history/1941_metro-5/|title=New York 1941 (Westchester-Rockland)|accessdate=2007-09-06}}</ref>

A short extension on the south end happened after 1960, when Route 9A took over former [[New York State Route 27A|Route 27A]] from the Holland Tunnel south to the [[Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel]].<ref name="1965map">{{cite map|publisher=[[Rand McNally]]|title=New York|year=1965|cartography=[[Rand McNally]]}}</ref><ref name="1971map">{{cite map|publisher=[[Humble Oil & Refining Company]]|title=New York|year=1971|cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref> To the north, the designation was extended at some point to [[Peekskill (NY)|Peekskill]] along the pre-Croton Expressway (opened in 1967) US 9, running concurrent with US 9 for a short distance to [[Croton-on-Hudson (NY)|Croton-on-Hudson]] before splitting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewYork/NewYorkCity/gousha_ra_1967_038.html|title=Gousha Road Atlas, 1967 edition|accessdate=2007-09-06}}</ref>
