===Return to Impact Zone Wrestling===
He then returned to Impact Zone Wrestling, where he won the [[NWA Arizona Heavyweight Championship]] on December 30, 2008 in a match against G.Q. Gallo. The match ended in controversy, however, because both men's shoulders were on the mat as the referee counted the [[Professional wrestling#Pinfall|pinfall]].
