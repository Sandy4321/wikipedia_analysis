The '''Francisco Fajardo Highway''' is the most important freeway of [[Caracas]], connecting the west and east sides of the city. The national freeways and many of the avenues of Caracas are not designated with a system of codification or numbering; instead they are designated with the names of historical personages. [[Francisco Castillo Fajardo, Marquis of Villadarias|Francisco Fajardo]] (1642-1716) was a Spanish general. Also in Caracas, the connections between freeways are also given peculiar names - ''the squid, the spider'' and ''the centipede'' are examples.  

The freeway's respective branches go from [[Petare]] and connect with the Grand Marshal Ayacucho Highway (Petare-Guarenas section), and to the southwest of Caracas through the ''La Paz'' neighborhood finishing in ''Las Adjuntas'' and ''Macarao''. there is alsono a subbranch to [[Caricuao]]. The main branches are the East Highway that starts from the Centipede connection (in the [[Chacao Municipality]]) and finishes in the ''La Trinidad'' section of Caracas. At La Trinidad, El Hatillo avenue begins; it ends in the La Lagunita neighborhood. the second branch goes towards the south of the city and is named Valle-Coche Highway. It terminates with a connection to the ''Regional del Centro'' Highway. Another branch goes from Catia to the beginning of the Caracas-La Guaira Highway.
