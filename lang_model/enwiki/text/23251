A '''pseudodeficiency allele''' or '''pseudodeficiency mutation''' is a mutation that alters the protein product or changes the gene's expression, but without causing disease. For example, in the [[lysosomal storage diseases]], patients with a pseudodeficiency allele show greatly reduced enzyme activity, yet they remain clinically healthy.

In medical genetics, a [[false positive]] result occurs in an [[enzyme assay]] test when test results are positive, but disease or morbidity is not present. One possible cause of false positive results is a pseudodeficiency allele. Disease may also be present, but at a subclinical level. 

== Examples ==

* '''[[Tay-Sachs disease]]'''. Enzyme assay testing was especially effective among Ashkenazi Jews because fewer [[pseudodeficiency alleles]] are found in this population, as compared with the general population.<ref>{{cite journal | date=1992 | title=A pseudodeficiency allele common in non-Jewish Tay-Sachs carriers: Implications for carrier screening | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume=51 | pages=793<U+2013>801 | author = Triggs-Raine BL, Mules EH, Kaback MM, and Lynne-Steele JST, Dowling CE, Ackerman BR}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | date=1993 | title=A second mutation associated with apparent beta-hexosaminidase A pseudodeficiency: identification and frequency estimation. | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume=53 | pages=1198<U+2013>1205 | author = Cao, Z; Natowicz, MR; Kaback, MM; Lim-Steele, JS; Prence, EM; Brown, D; Chabot, T; Triggs-Raine, BL. }}</ref> Carrier screening has not been as reliable in the general population. 

* '''[[Metachromatic leukodystrophy]]'''. Low [[Arylsulfatase A|arylsulphatase A]] activity can occur in healthy individuals. This poses a challenge in genetic testing, making it difficult to distinguish between patients who are at risk of developing the disease and those who are healthy carriers of a pseudodeficiency mutation. Metachromatic leukodystrophy is a classic example of the difficulties caused by pseudodeficiency in carrier screening, because very high pseudodeficiency carrier frequencies have been detected in some populations.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Barth ML, Ward C, Harris A, Saad A, and Fensom A |title=Frequency of arylsulphatase A pseudodeficiency associated mutations in a healthy population |journal=Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=31 |issue= 9 |pages=667<U+2013>71 |year=1994 |pmid= PMC1050073}}</ref>

== Implications == 

A pseudodeficiency allele may indicate a deficiency of the enzyme assay method, or it may reflect incomplete understanding of the enzyme's activity. 

* The enzyme assay may be invalid because of differences between the natural substrate and an artificial substrate used in testing.
* The gene may be expressed differently in different tissues, causing a positive result in the tissue that is tested even though no disease is present. Blood serum is often used for enzyme assay testing because it can be sampled inexpensively. Testing with other tissue types may produce more reliable results.
* The enzyme assay may be valid, but understanding of the disease and the [[metabolic pathway]] in which it occurs may be incorrect or incomplete.

Because of pseudodeficiency alleles, the results of enzyme assay testing in one population cannot be generalized to other populations. 

For some genetic diseases, especially those that have low [[penetrance]] or are easily treatable, [[genetic testing|carrier screening]] may be of questionable value when pseudodeficiency alleles are present at high frequency.<ref>{{cite journal | date=2007-9-19 | title=Carrier screening for Gaucher disease: Lessons for low-penetrance, treatable diseases | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume=298 | issue=11 | pages=1281-90 | author = Zuckerman S, Lahad A, Shmueli A, Zimran A, Peleg L, Orr-Urtreger A, Levy-Lahad E, Sagi M}}</ref>
