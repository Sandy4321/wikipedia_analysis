{{Pakistan terrorist attacks}}

On 16 February 2013, at least 84 people were killed and 190 injured after a bomb hidden in a water tank exploded at a market in [[Hazara Town]] on the outskirts of [[Quetta]], the capital city of [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], [[Pakistan]].<ref name="BNONews2013"/><ref name="AryNews2013"/> Most of the victims were members of the predominantly [[Shia]] [[Twelver]] ethnic [[Hazara people|Hazara community]], and authorities expected the death toll to rise due to the large number of serious injuries. The [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]] group claimed responsibility for the blast, the second major attack against the Shia Hazaras [[January 2013 Pakistan bombings|in a month]].<ref>{{cite paper|last=Yousufzai|first=Gul |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/16/us-pakistan-violence-shiites-idUSBRE91F02J20130216|title=Bomb kills 64 in Pakistan's Quetta |newspaper=Reuters|date=16 February 2013|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://dawn.com/2013/02/16/large-blast-hits-quetta-at-least-five-wounded/|title=Large blast rips through Quetta; 63 killed|newspaper=DAWN|date=16 February 2013|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.geo.tv/GeoDetail.aspx?ID=88338|title=Blast leaves 79 dead, 170 injured in Quetta |publisher=GEO TV|date=16 February 2013|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://dunyanews.tv/index.php/en/Pakistan/159869-Quetta-69-killed-150-injured-in-blast-at-Kirani-R|title=Quetta: 69 killed 150 injured in blast at Kirani R|newspaper=Dunya News|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-88338-Quetta:-Kerani-Road-blast-toll-rises-to-79|title=Quetta: Kerani Road blast toll rises to 79|newspaper=The News|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref>

As of 19 February, one of the masterminds of the attack has been arrested and taken into custody along with 170 suspects, and four high-profile militants accused of killing Shia civilians were killed during an operation by security forces.

{{Further|Sectarian violence in Pakistan}}

Acts of violence involving Sunni Muslims and their Shia counterparts in Pakistan have been evident since the 1980s. They are generally considered to have arisen from attempts by the then national leader, [[Zia ul-Haq]], to legitimise his [[military dictatorship]] and from the influx of weapons into the country following the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. Although the perpetrators often do not claim responsibility for the attacks, expert analysis suggests that in recent times it is the Sunnis who are dominating the aggression and that they are motivated by the ideology of [[Al Qaeda]].<ref name="BBC20111004">{{cite news|publisher=BBC|date=4 October 2011|title=Pakistan's evolving sectarian schism|first=Alastair|last=Lawson|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12278919|accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref> The number of violent incidents has been increasing in recent years, although not all of them are classified by the police as being sectarian attacks.<ref name="BBC20121122"/>

Quetta, which is the capital of the Pakistani province of Balochistan, has seen numerous of these violent incidents. This is in part because of a separatist movement involving militants from the [[Balochistan Liberation Army]] who desire greater autonomy and also because the Pakistani military is engaged in counter-insurgency operations near to the province's border with Afghanistan, where there is tribal strife that involves the Taliban and allied groups.<ref name="BBC20121122">{{cite news|publisher=BBC|date=22 November 2012|title=Taliban bomber kills Pakistan Shia marchers|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20425510|accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref>

Similarly, the [[January 2013 Pakistan bombings]] in Quetta led to nearly a 100 deaths and caused widespread anger leading to the dismissal of the provincial government.

==Bombing==
The bomb went off in a market area with many grocery stores, several language schools and a large computer centre. It took place towards the end of the market day, as lots of people were shopping for food and children were coming out of school classes. According to Quetta's police chief Mir Zubai Mehmood, around 70-80 kg of explosives had been planted inside a water tank that had been installed on a tractor trailer.<ref name=telegram17feb>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20130217/NEWS/102179836/1052/mobile&TEMPLATE=MOBILE|title=Bomb blast kills 65 in Pakistan market|publisher=Telegram|date=17 February 2013|accessdate=17 February 2013}}</ref> 

Initial reports suggested the bomb had been attached to a parked motorbike. The blast dealt severe damage to buildings in the area, destroying at least one two-story house and trapping many under rubble. Sporadic gunfire was reported after the attack, and locals were reportedly hesitant to approach the site in the immediate aftermath for fear of more bombs. Angry members of the [[Hazara people|Hazara]] minority set up roadblocks with burning tires and fired into the air in order to keep people away from the blast site in case of a second attack. Photos from the scene showed groups of desperate people rushing the injured into ambulances and private vehicles, as emergency services quickly became overloaded.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/02/2013216133651823848.html|title=Pakistan blast targets Quetta's Shia minority|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=16 February 2013|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/news/bomb-blast-pakistan-200-383/|title=Pakistan bomb blast kills at least 79 people, injures 200|publisher=RT|date=16 February 2013|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> Nevertheless, police forces worked throughout the evening and into the night, with the death toll being updated several times due to more bodies being pulled out from beneath rubble.<ref>{{cite news|author=Imran Ali|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21485731|title=Dozens dead in bomb attack on Quetta market|publisher=BBC|date=16 February 2013|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref>

It is expected that the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Sunni Muslim [[Extremist Groups|extremist militant group]], Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ), is behind the attacks on the Hazara minority in the region.<ref>{{cite news|author=B.
