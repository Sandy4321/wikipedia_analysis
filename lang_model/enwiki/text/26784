== History ==

Ferries have provided transportation to and from Vashon Island since the days of the Seattle [[Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet|Mosquito Fleet]], but the state government took over the operation of the Vashon Island ferry on June 1, 1951<ref name="times history">{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20010601&slug=ferries01m|title=Vashon Islanders symbolize love-hate relationship with ferries as they turn 50|last=Tu|first=Janet I.|date=2001-06-01|publisher=[[Seattle Times]]|accessdate=2008-09-07}}</ref>. The ''MV Kalama'' was built in 1989<ref name="wsf kalama" />, and the ferry route was designated SR 339 in 1994<ref name="rcw">{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=47.17.571|title=47.17.571|date=1994|work=[[Revised Code of Washington]]|publisher=[[Washington State Legislature]]|accessdate=2008-09-07}}</ref>.  

In 2003 the average daily ridership was 827 passengers per day, based on a five day week, compared to 1,015 passengers on average when the route operated on a six day schedule in 1999.<ref name="2003wsf survey" /> 

WSF operates and maintains the ''MV Kalama'' currently, but by July 2009 the KCFD will assume all responsibilities of the operation. Currently the route no longer receives state funding, and King County will be responsible for all costs of the route, to be funded by property taxes<ref name="wsdot pr">{{cite press release |title=King County Ferry District assumes cost of Vashon Island passenger-only service July 1 |publisher=[[Washington State Department of Transportation]] |date= 2008-06-26|url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/News/2008/06/king-county-ferry-district-assumes-cost.htm |accessdate=2008-09-06 }}</ref>.
