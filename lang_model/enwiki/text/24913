'''Madison Kyle Bumgarner''' (born August 1, 1989), nicknamed '''"MadBum,"'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121014&content_id=39807688&vkey=news_sf&c_id=sf |title=Struggling MadBum might not garner next start| author=Hagen, Paul |publisher=MLB Advanced Media |date=October 15, 2012 |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref> is an American [[professional baseball]] [[starting pitcher]] with the [[San Francisco Giants]] of [[Major League Baseball]], who played key roles in the Giants' 2010 and 2012 [[World Series]] championships. Bumgarner is listed as {{convert|6|ft|5|in|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|225|lb|kg|abbr=off}}. Bumgarner features a four-seam [[fastball]] in the {{convert|90|to|93|mph}} range, a [[Cutter (baseball)|cutter]] or [[slider]] around {{convert|86|to|90|mph}}, a [[curveball]] that ranges from {{convert|75|to|80|mph}}, and a [[change-up]] that sits at {{convert|82|to|84|mph}}.

Bumgarner was born in in [[Hickory, North Carolina|Hickory]], [[North Carolina]], and attended [[South Caldwell High School]] in [[Hudson, North Carolina|Hudson]], where he helped his baseball team win the 2007 4A State Championship. He was drafted by the [[San Francisco Giants]] in the first round (tenth overall) in the [[2007 Major League Baseball Draft]] out of high school. In his first year playing professionally, 2008, he won the [[South Atlantic League]] [[pitching triple crown]]. He made his major league debut in 2009 with the Giants. In 2010, he began the season in the minor leagues but was called up midway through the season and wound up becoming the youngest left-handed pitcher to throw eight scoreless innings in a [[World Series]] as the Giants won the [[2010 World Series]], their first since 1954. He got off to an 0&ndash;5 start in 2011 but managed to finish with a 13&ndash;13 [[Win-loss record (pitching)|record]]. In 2012, Bumgarner set a career-high with 16 wins and won his second World Series. He had the best [[earned run average|ERA]] of his career in 2013, at 2.77, and was named the Giants' [[Opening Day]] starter prior to the 2014 season.

==Career==

===Early years===
Bumgarner was born August 1, 1989, in [[Hickory, North Carolina|Hickory]], [[North Carolina]], in an area nicknamed "Bumtown" because of the abundance of people with the last name Bumgarner who have lived there over the years. He grew up in a log house that his father, Kevin, built, sleeping in a loft at nights. Bumgarner's first word was "ball," and by the age of four, he was already playing in a youth baseball league. His father had to sign a waiver because the league was for five-to-eight-year olds. His parents, Kevin and Debbie, divorced while Bumgarner was in high school.<ref name="early life">{{cite web |last=Adelson |first=Eric |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/news/giants-pitcher-madison-bumgarner-is-from-a-place-nicknamed--bumtown--almost-a-century-ago.html;_ylt=A0LEVytdtTZTbUgAtVxXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTEzdWRpYjU4BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNQRjb2xvA2JmMQR2dGlkA1ZJUDM3MF8x |title=Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner is from a place nicknamed 'Bumtown' almost a century ago |work=Yahoo!

Bumgarner was selected in the first round (10th overall) by the Giants. Going into the draft, ''[[Baseball America]]'' had ranked him as the 14th best prospect overall. He was the first high school pitcher to be selected by the Giants with their first pick since [[Matt Cain]] in 2002, the first left-handed pitcher selected in the first round by the organization since [[Noah Lowry]] in 2001.<ref name="draft"/>

===Minor leagues===
Bumgarner pitched for the [[Augusta Greenjackets]], the Giants' [[Single-A (baseball)|Low-A]] [[South Atlantic League]] affiliate, in 2008. The Giants sought for him to alter the angle of his head during his delivery, but after Bumgarner struggled over his first three starts in Augusta, he reverted to the way he had thrown in high school. With Augusta, he worked on the [[changeup]], the [[slider]], and "the ability to pitch inside." When asked if it was tough to work on off-speed pitches in a league in which most of the hitters can be fooled with the [[fastball]], Bumgarner replied, "The minors are all about player development. I needed to work on other pitches and have the confidence to throw them."<ref name="Christian"/> He won the South Atlantic League pitchers' [[Triple Crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]], tying for the league lead in wins (15, tied with Levi Maxwell), leading the league in [[earned run average]] (1.46), and leading the league in [[strikeout]]s (164).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/leader.cgi?type=pitch&id=73b8a932 |title=2008 South Atlantic League Pitching Leaders |work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] (Minors) |accessdate=May 15, 2013}}</ref> He began the 2009 season with the Giants' High-A affiliate, the [[San Jose Giants]] of the [[California League]].

In 2008, ''Baseball America'' ranked him the third-best prospect in the Giants organization.<ref>{{cite web |last=Baggarly |first=Andy |url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/prospects/features/265340.html |title=Baseball America Top 10 Prospects List |publisher=Baseball America |date=December 14, 2007 |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref> Before the start of the 2009 season, they ranked Bumgarner as the ninth-best prospect in baseball.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/prospects/rankings/top-100-prospects/2009/267698.html | title=Top 100 Prospects: 1-20 | publisher=Baseball America | date=February 24, 2009 | accessdate=August 14, 2012}}</ref> Entering 2010, they dropped him to 14th-best prospect in baseball, as some writers were concerned about a drop in Bumgarner's velocity.

===Major leagues===
Bumgarner was called up to the majors on September 8, 2009, to make his first major league start and debut in place of [[Tim Lincecum]], who was scratched with back spasms. At the age of 20, he became the second youngest pitcher ever to start a game for the Giants since the franchise moved west in 1958. He was older only than [[Mike McCormick (pitcher)|Mike McCormick]], who made his debut for San Francisco as a 19-year-old when the team was still in New York.<ref>{{cite news |title=Headley leads Padres past Giants |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2009-09-08-padres-giants_N.htm |date=September 8, 2009 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=September 9, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090908&content_id=6863468&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=sf |title=Bumgarner solid, but Giants lose ground |accessdate=September 16, 2009|last= Haft |first=Chris |date=September 9, 2009|publisher=MLB Advanced Media}}</ref> Bumgarner made four appearances with the Giants in 2009, posting an ERA of 1.80, striking out 10 batters, and pitching 10 innings without recording a [[Decision (baseball)|decision]].<ref name="MLB"/>

Bumgarner attended the Giants' spring training before the 2010 season, competing for the position of fifth starter. However, out of shape after attending his half-sister's funeral, he struggled and was sent down to the [[Triple-A (baseball)|AAA]] [[Fresno Grizzlies]], partly due to a drop in his velocity.<ref>Baggarly, pp. 189-191</ref><ref name="drop">{{cite web |last=Grey |first=Jason |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/fantasy/baseball/flb/story?page=60F6I090922 |publisher=ESPN |title=What's wrong with Bumgarner? |date=September 22, 2009 |accessdate=November 15, 2010}}</ref> In 14 starts with Fresno, he went 7&ndash;1 with a 3.16 ERA and 59 strikeouts.<ref name="minors"/> On June 26, 2010, Bumgarner was called up again to join the club, facing the [[Boston Red Sox]] the next day.

====2014====
Following his outstanding 2013 season, on February 25, 2014, Bumgarner was named the Giants' [[Opening Day]] starter for the first time in his career.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bumgarner to start Opening Day|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/10518603/madison-bumgarner-named-san-francisco-giants-opening-day-starter|publisher=ESPN|date=February 25, 2014|accessdate=March 4, 2014}}</ref>

==Pitching Style==
Bumgarner's repertoire consists of four pitches. He features a four-seam [[fastball]] in the {{convert|90|to|93|mph}} range that tops off at 95 mph, a [[Cutter (baseball)|cutter]] or [[slider]] around {{convert|86|to|90|mph}}, a [[curveball]] that ranges from {{convert|75|to|80|mph}}, and a [[change-up]] that sits at {{convert|82|to|84|mph}}. The fastball and slider are his main pitches; through 2013, he has thrown the fastball 43.68% of the time and the slider 33.84% of the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brooksbaseball.net/landing.php?player=518516 |title=Player Card: Madison Bumgarner |publisher=brooksbaseball.net |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref>
