'''Inca mythology''' includes many stories and legends that are mythological and helps to explain or symbolizes Inca  beliefs.

All those that followed the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]] by [[Francisco Pizarro]] burned the records of the [[Inca]] culture. There is currently a theory put forward by [[Gary Urton]] that the [[Quipus]] represented a [[Binary numeral system|binary]] system capable of recording [[phonological]] or [[logographic]] [[data]]. All information for what is known is based on what was recorded by priests, from the [[iconography]] on Incan pottery and architecture, and the myths and legends which survived amongst the [[native peoples]].

== Inca foundation legends ==
[[Manco Capac]] was the legendary founder of the Inca Dynasty in Peru and the Cuzco Dynasty at Cuzco.  The legends and history surrounding this mythical figure are very jumbled, especially those concerning his rule at Cuzco and his birth/rising.  In one legend, he was the son of [[Inca Viracocha|Tici Viracocha]].  In another, he was brought up from the depths of [[Lake Titicaca]] by the sun god [[Inti]]. However, commoners were not allowed to speak the name of Inca Viracocha, which is possibly an explanation for the need for three foundation legends rather than just the first.

There were also many myths about Manco Capac and his coming to power.  In one myth, [[Manco Capac]] and his brother [[Pacha Kamaq]] were sons of the sun god [[Inti]].  Manco Capac, himself, was worshiped'' as a fire and sun'' god. According to this Inti legend, Manco Capac and his siblings were sent up to the earth by the sun god and emerged from the cave of Puma Orco at [[Pacaritambo]] carrying a golden staff called <U+2018>[[tapac-yauri]]<U+2019>. They were instructed to create a Temple of the Sun in the spot where the staff sank into the earth  to honor the sun god Inti, their father.  During the journey, one of Manco<U+2019>s brothers ([[Ayar Cachi]]) was tricked into returning to Puma Orco and sealed inside, or alternatively was turned to ice, because his reckless and cruel behavior angered the tribes that they were attempting to rule. (''[[huaca]]'').  

In another version of this legend, instead of emerging from a cave in Cuzco, the siblings emerged from the waters of [[Lake Titicaca]].  Since this was a later origin myth than that of Pacaritambo it may have been created as a ploy to bring the powerful Aymara tribes into the fold of the Tawantinsuyo. 

In the Inca Virachocha legend, Manco Capac was the son of [[Viracocha|Inca Viracocha]] of [[Pacari-Tampu]], today known as [[Pacaritambo]], which is 25&nbsp;km (16&nbsp;mi) south of Cuzco.  He and his brothers (''[[Ayar Auca]]'', ''[[Ayar Cachi]]'', and ''[[Ayar Uchu]]''); and sisters ([[Mama Ocllo]], ''[[Mama Huaco]]'', ''[[Mama Raua]]'', and ''[[Mama Cura]]'') lived near [[Cusco|Cuzco]] at Paccari-Tampu, and uniting their people and the ten [[ayllu]] they encountered in their travels to conquer the tribes of the Cuzco Valley.  This legend also incorporates the golden staff, which is thought to have been given to Manco Capac by his father. Accounts vary, but according to some versions of the legend, the young Manco jealously betrayed his older brothers, killed them, and then became Cuzco.

== Deities ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Ekkeko]] -->
Like the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], the Incas permitted the cultures they integrated into their empire to keep their individual religions. Below are some of the various gods worshiped by the peoples of the Incan empire, many of which have overlapping responsibilities and domains. Unless otherwise noted, it can safely be assumed these were worshipped by different [[ayllu]]s or worshipped in particular former states.

*''Apo'' or [[Apu (god)|Apu]] was a god or spirit of [[mountain]]s.  All of the important mountains have their own Apu, and some of them receive sacrifices to bring out certain aspects of their being.  Some rocks and caves also are credited as having their own apu.
*''[[Apocatequil]]'' (aka ''Apotequil'') or ''Illapa'' was  the god of [[lightning]].
*''[[Ataguchu]]'' was a god who assisted in [[creation myth]]
*''[[Catequil (god)|Catequil]]'' was a god of thunder and lightning
*''[[Cavillace]]'' was a virgin goddess who ate a fruit, which was actually the sperm of [[Coniraya]], the moon god. When she gave birth to a son, she demanded that the father step forward. No one did, so she put the baby on the ground and it crawled towards Coniraya. She was ashamed because of Coniraya's low stature among the gods, and ran to the coast of Peru, where she changed herself and her son into rocks.
*''Chasca'' was the goddess of [[dawn]] and [[twilight]], and [[Venus]]. She protected [[virgin]] girls.
*''Chasca Coyllur'' was the goddess of flowers,young maidens, and sex.
*'' Kuka Mama'' or ''Mama Kuka'' (in quechua: Mother coca) was a goddess of health and joy. She was originally a promiscuous woman who was cut in half by her many lovers. Her body grew into the first coca plant, the leaves of which men were only allowed to chew (to bring health and happiness).
*''Coniraya'' was the [[deity]] of the [[lunar deity|moon]] who fashioned his sperm into a fruit, which ''Cavillaca'' then ate.  When she gave birth to a son, she demanded that the father step forward. No one did, so she put the baby on the ground and it crawled towards Coniraya. She was ashamed because of Coniraya's low stature among the gods, and ran to the coast of [[Peru]], where she changed herself and her son into rock [[huacas]].
*''Copacati'' was a lake goddess.
*''Ekkeko'' was a god of the [[hearth]] and [[wealth]]. The ancients made [[doll]]s that represented him and placed a miniature version of their desires onto the doll; this was believed to caused the user to receive what he desired.
*''Illapa'' ("[[thunder]] and [[lightning]]"; aka ''Apu Illapu'', Ilyap'a, Katoylla) was a very popular [[weather]] god. His holiday was on July 25. He was said to keep the [[Milky Way]] in a [[Jug (container)|jug]] and use it to create [[rain]]. He appeared as a man in shining clothes, carrying a [[club (weapon)|club]] and [[rock (geology)|stone]]s. He was formerly the main god of the ''[[Kingdom of Colla]]'' after which the ''Collasuyu'' province of the [[Inca empire]] was named.
*''[[Inti]]'' was the [[sun]] god. Source of warmth and light and a protector of the people. Inti was considered the most important god. The Inca Emperors were believed to be the lineal descendants of the sun god.
*''[[Kon (Inca mythology)|Kon]]'' was the god of [[rain]] and [[wind]] that came from the south. He was a son of Inti and Mama Quilla.
*''Mama Allpa'' was a fertility goddess depicted with multiple breasts.
*''[[Mama Cocha]]'' ("sea mother") was the sea and fish goddess, protectress of sailors and fishermen. In one legend she mothered [[Inti]] and Mama Quilla with [[Viracocha]].
*''[[Mama Pacha]]'' (aka ''Pachamama'') was the wife of Pachacamac and a [[dragoness]] [[fertility]] deity who presided over [[planting]] and [[harvesting]]. She caused [[earthquakes]].
*''[[Mama Quilla]]'' ("mother moon" or "[[gold]]en mother") was a marriage, festival and [[moon goddess]] and daughter of [[Viracocha]] and ''Mama Cocha'', as well as wife and sister of [[Inti]].  She was the mother of [[Manco Capac]], ''Pachacamac'', ''Kon'' and ''Mama Ocllo''.
*''[[Mama Zara]]'' ("grain mother", aka Zaramama) was the goddess of grain. She was associated with [[maize]] that grew in multiples or were similarly strange. These strange plants were sometimes dressed as dolls of Mama Zara. She was also associated with [[willow]] trees.
*''[[Pacha Camac]]'' ("Earth-maker") was a [[chthonic]] [[creator god]], earlier worshiped by the [[Ichma]] but later adopted into the creation myth of the Inca.
*''[[Pariacaca]]'' was a god of [[water]] in pre-Inca mythology that was adopted by the Inca. He was a god of rainstorms and a creator-god. He was born a [[falcon]] but later became human.
*''[[Paricia]]'' was a god who sent a [[flood]] to kill humans who did not respect him adequately. Possibly another name for Pachacamac.
*''[[Supay]]'' was both the god of [[death]] and ruler of the ''[[Uca Pacha]]'' as well as a race of [[demon]]s.
*''[[Urcaguary]]'' was the god of [[metal]]s, [[Gemstone|jewel]]s and other underground items of great value.
*''[[Urcuchillay]]'' was a deity that watched over animals.
*''[[Viracocha]]'' was the god of everything. In the beginning he was the main god, but when Pachacutec became Inca, he changed this god's importance pointing out that it was Inti who allowed him to defeat the chancas (The Incas' main enemies at that time)

==Important beliefs==
*[[Mama Ocllo]] was the sister and wife of [[Manco Capac]]. She was thought to have taught the Inca the art of spinning.
*''[[Mamaconas]]'' were similar to nuns and lived in temple sanctuaries.  They dedicated their lives to [[Inti]], and served the Inca and priests. Young girls of the nobility or of exceptional beauty were trained for four years as ''acllas'' and then had the option of becoming mamaconas or marrying Inca nobles. They are comparable to the Roman [[Vestal Virgins]], though Inca society did not value virginity as a virtue the way Western societies have done throughout history.
*In one legend, ''[[Unu Pachakuti]]'' was a great flood sent by Virachocha to destroy the giants that built [[Tiwanaku]].
*A [[Huaca]] was a sacred object such as a mountain or a mummy.

== Important places ==
*''[[Uku Pacha]]'' ("the lower world") was the [[underworld]] (similar to [[Hell]] or [[Hades]]), located in the center of [[Earth]].
*''[[Kay Pacha]]''  was the world in which we live.
*''[[Hanan Pacha]]'' ("higher world") was the Heavenly underworld. Only [[righteous]] people could enter it (much like [[Heaven]]), crossing a bridge made of hair.

== Inca symbols ==
*''[[Chakana]]'' (or Inca Cross, Chakana) is the three-stepped cross equivalent symbolic of what is known in other mythologies as the Tree of Life, World Tree and so on. Through a central axis a shaman journeyed in trance to the lower plane or Underworld and the higher levels inhabited by the superior gods to enquire into the causes of misfortune on the Earth plane. The snake, puma, and condor are totemic representatives of the three levels.
