The '''Finnish Civil War ''' was a part of the national and social turmoil caused by [[World War I]] (1914&ndash;1918) in Europe. The war was fought in [[Finland]] from 27 January to 15 May 1918, between the forces of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]] led by the [[People's Deputation of Finland]], commonly called the "Reds" ''(punaiset)'', and the forces of the non-socialist, [[conservatism|conservative]]-led [[Senate of Finland|Senate]], commonly called the "Whites" ''(valkoiset)''. The Reds were supported by [[Russian SFSR]], while the Whites received military assistance from the [[German Empire]].

The [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution]]s in 1917 caused defeat in World War I and a total collapse of the [[Russian Empire]] (which at the time included Finland), and the destruction in Russia resulted in a corresponding breakdown of Finnish society during 1917. The Social Democrats on the left and conservatives on the right competed for the leadership of the Finnish state, which shifted from the left to the right in 1917. Both groups collaborated with the corresponding political forces in Russia, deepening the split in the nation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=109&ndash;114, 195&ndash;263}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=185&ndash;196}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=11&ndash;13, 152&ndash;156}}</ref>

As there were no generally accepted police and army forces to keep order in Finland after March 1917, the left and right began building security groups of their own, leading to the emergence of two independent armed military troops, the [[White Guard (Finland)|White]] and [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]]. An atmosphere of political violence and fear grew among the Finns. Fighting broke out during January 1918 due to the acts of both the Reds and Whites in a spiral of military and political escalation. The Whites were victorious in the ensuing war. In the aftermath of the 1917<U+2013>18 crisis and the Civil War, Finland passed from [[Russia]]n rule to the German sphere of influence. The conservative senate attempted to establish a Finnish [[monarchy]] ruled by a [[Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse|German king]], but after the defeat of Germany in World War I, Finland emerged as an independent, [[democracy|democratic]] [[republic]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=434&ndash;435}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1986|pp=163&ndash;172}}, Manninen, T. 1992 in; Manninen, O. ed., part I pp. 346<U+2013>395 and pp. 398<U+2013>433, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=223&ndash;225, 237&ndash;243}},  {{Harvnb|Vares|1998|pp=56&ndash;137}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=264&ndash;291}}</ref> 

The Civil War remains the most controversial and emotionally loaded event in the history of modern Finland, and there have even been disputes about what the conflict should be called.<ref>The Finnish Civil War has also been called ''The Freedom War'', ''The Brethren War'', ''The Class War'', ''The Red Rebellion'', and ''The Finnish Revolution''. [http://www.uta.fi/koskivoimaa/valta/1918-40/luokkasota.htm Haapala 1993] , {{Harvnb|Manninen|1993}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1993b}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2000}}</ref> Approximately 37,000 people died during the conflict, including casualties at the war fronts and deaths from political [[terrorism|terror]] campaigns and high [[labor camp|prison camp]] mortality rates. The turmoil destroyed the [[Economy of Finland|economy]], split the political apparatus, and divided the Finnish nation for many years. The country was slowly reunited through the compromises of moderate [[Politics of Finland|political groups]] on the left and right.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=241&ndash;256}}</ref>

==Background==
The main factor behind the Finnish Civil War was World War I. The conflict caused a collapse of the [[Russian Empire]], mainly in the [[February Revolution]] and the [[October Revolution]] during 1917. This led to a formation of a large power vacuum and struggle for power. Finland, as a part of the Russian Empire, was strongly affected by the turmoil and by the war between [[German Empire|Germany]] and Russia. Both empires had political, economic, and military interests in Finland. An earlier crisis in the relations between Imperial Russia and the [[autonomous area|autonomous]] [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] had occurred in 1899 as the central administration had strengthened in [[Saint Petersburg]], and the tension and competition rose between the major European powers at that time. The Russian leaders, as part of an attempt to unite the large, heterogeneous empire, had adopted the program of the [[Russification of Finland]], with the aim of reducing Finnish autonomy. The [[Finnish people|Finns]] called this policy  "the first period of oppression 1899&ndash;1905". As a reaction, plans for disengagement from Russia or achieving sovereignty for Finland were drawn up for the first time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=13&ndash;15}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=110&ndash;114, 150&ndash;196}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=11&ndash;13, 152&ndash;156}}, {{Harvnb|Jutikkala|Pirinen|2003|pp=397}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=264&ndash;282}}</ref>

[[Image:Peasants in finland.jpg|thumb|270px|Peasants in the fields. Many Finns were agrarian workers and crofters, who had no political influence in the [[social class|class society]] that existed before the parliamentary reform in 1906.]]

Before the first period of Russification, Finland had enjoyed autonomy inside Russia. Compared to other parts of the Russian Empire, Finno-Russian relations had been exceptionally peaceful and stable. As this policy altered due to the changes in the Russian military doctrine, the Finns began to strongly oppose the imperial system. Several political groups with different opposition policies arose; the most radical one, the activist movement, led to [[Finnish J<U+00E4>ger troops|covert collaboration]] with Imperial Germany during World War I.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=30&ndash;32}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2000}}</ref>

Major reasons for the rising tensions among the Finns was the autocratic rule of the Russian [[Tsar]], and the undemocratic [[social class|class system]] of the [[estates of the realm|estates]] in the Grand Duchy, originating in the [[Swedish Empire|Swedish regime]] of the 17th century, which effectively divided the Finnish people into two groups, separated economically, socially and politically. The labour movement activity after 1899 not only opposed Russification but also sought to develop a domestic policy that tackled social problems and responded to the demand for democracy. Finland's population grew rapidly in the 19th century, and a class of industrial and agrarian workers and propertyless [[peasant]]s emerged. The [[Industrial Revolution]] and [[economic freedom]] had arrived in Finland later than in Western Europe (1840&ndash;1870), owing to the rule of the [[Romanov]] family. This meant that some of the social problems associated with industrialisation were diminished by learning from the experiences of countries such as [[England]]. The social conditions, the standard of living, and the self-confidence of the workers gradually improved between 1870&ndash;1914, and at the same time the political concepts of [[socialism]], [[nationalism]] and [[liberalism]] took root. But as the standard of living rose among the common people, the rift between rich and poor deepened markedly.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haapala|1986}}, {{Harvnb|Apunen|1987|pp=73&ndash;133}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=62&ndash;66, 105&ndash;108}}</ref>

The Finnish [[labour movement]], which emerged at the end of the 19th century out of folk, [[temperance]]<ref>Rauli Mickelsson: Suomen puolueet <U+2013> historia, muutos ja nykyp<U+00E4>iv<U+00E4>. Vastapaino, 2007. ISBN 978-951-768-217-6.</ref> and [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland#History|religious movement]]s and [[fennomania]], had a "Finnish national, working class" character and was represented by the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]], established in 1899. The movement came to the fore without major confrontations when tensions during Russia's failed [[Russo-Japanese War|war against Japan]] led in 1905 to a [[Russian Revolution of 1905#Finland|general strike in Finland]] and [[Russian Revolution of 1905|revolutionary upheaval]] in the empire. In an attempt to quell the general unrest, the system of estates was abolished in the [[Parliament of Finland#History|parliamentary reform of 1906]], which introduced [[universal suffrage]]. All adults including female citizens were given the right to vote increasing the number of voters from 126,000 to 1,273,000. This soon produced around 50% turnouts for the Social Democrats, although there were no evident improvements for their supporters. The Russian Tsar, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], regained his authority after this crisis, reclaimed his role as the [[Grand Duke of Finland]], and during the second period of Russification between 1908 and 1917 neutralized the functions and powers of the new parliament. The confrontations between the Finnish people's representatives of  the largely uneducated common man and the Finns of the former estates accustomed to the meritocratic rule and attitudes diminished also the capability of the new parliament to solve major social and economical problems during the ten years before the collapse of the Finnish state.<ref>{{Harvnb|Apunen|1987|pp=242&ndash;250}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=85&ndash;100, 101&ndash;127, 150&ndash;151}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=230&ndash;232}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|1998|pp=62&ndash;78}}, {{Harvnb|Jutikkala|Pirinen|2003|pp=372<U+2013>373, 377}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=244&ndash;263}} [[Parliament of Finland#History|Parliamentary reform of 1906]]</ref>

===February Revolution (1917)===
{{Seealso|February Revolution}}
[[Image:General Strike Helsinki 1917.jpg|thumb|220px|On strike in [[Helsinki]], 1917. Workers demanded food and a complete shifting of legislative power from the [[Russian Provisional Government|Russian government]] to the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish parliament]].]]

The more severe program of Russification, called "the second period of oppression 1908&ndash;1917" by the Finns, was halted on 15 March 1917 by the removal of the Russian Tsar Nicholas II. The immediate reason for the collapse of the Russian Empire was a domestic crisis precipitated by defeats against Germany and by war-weariness among the Russian people. The deeper causes of the revolution lay in the collision between the policies of the most conservative regime in Europe and the necessity for political and economic modernisation brought about by industrialisation. The Tsar's power was transferred to the Russian [[Duma]] and [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], which at this time had a right-wing majority.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=51&ndash;54}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1986|pp=163&ndash;164}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=230&ndash;243}}</ref>

Autonomous status was returned to the Finns in March 1917, and the revolt in Russia handed the Finnish Parliament true political power for the first time. The left comprised mainly Social Democrats, covering a wide spectrum from moderate to revolutionary socialists; the right was even more diverse, ranging from liberals and moderate conservatives to radical rightist elements. The four main parties were the two old [[Fennoman]] parties, the conservative [[Finnish Party]] and the [[Young Finnish Party]] including both liberals and conservatives; the social reformist, centrist [[Centre Party (Finland)|Agrarian League]], which drew its support mainly from peasants with small or middle-sized  farms;  and the conservative [[Swedish People's Party (Finland)|Swedish People's Party]], which sought to retain the rights of the [[Swedish language|Swedish]]-speaking minority. 

The Finns faced a detrimental interaction of power struggle and breakdown of society during 1917. At the beginning of the 20th century, the [[Finnish people]] stood at the crossroads between the old regime of the estates and the evolution of a modern, democratic society. The direction and goal of this period of change now became a matter of intense political dispute, which eventually spilled over into armed conflict due to the weakness of the Finnish state. The Social Democrats aimed at retaining the political rights already achieved and establishing influence over the people. The conservatives were fearful of losing their long-held social and economic power.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=109, 195&ndash;263}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=143&ndash;149}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=11&ndash;14}}</ref>   

The Social Democratic Party had gained an [[absolute majority]] in the [[Parliament of Finland]] as a result of the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1916|general elections of 1916]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Kirby|2006|pp=150}}</ref> The new [[Senate of Finland|Senate]] was formed by Social Democrat and [[labor union|trade union]] leader [[Oskari Tokoi]]. His Senate cabinet comprised six representatives from the Social Democrats and six from non-socialist parties. In theory, the new cabinet consisted of a broad coalition; in practice, with the main political groups unwilling to compromise and the most experienced politicians remaining outside it, the cabinet proved unable to solve any major local Finnish problems. Real political power shifted instead to street level in the form of mass meetings, protests, strike organizations, and the street councils formed by workers and soldiers after the revolution, all of which served to undermine the authority of the state.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=221, 232&ndash;235}}</ref>

The rapid economic growth stimulated by World War I, which had raised the incomes of industrial workers during 1915 and 1916, collapsed with the February Revolution, and the consequent decrease in production and economy led to unemployment and heavy [[inflation]]. Large-scale strikes in both industry and agriculture spread throughout Finland, the workers calling for higher wages and [[eight-hour day|eight-hour-per-day]] working limits. The cessation of cereal imports from Russia had produced food shortages in the country, as a response to which the government introduced [[rationing]] and [[price fixing]]. However, a black market formed in which food prices continued to rise sharply, which was a major problem for the unemployed worker families. Food supply, prices, and the fear of starvation became emotional political issues between farmers in the countryside and industrial workers in the urban areas. The common people, their fears exploited by the politicians and the political media, took to the streets. Despite the food shortages, no large-scale starvation hit the Finns in southern Finland before the war. Economic factors remained a supporting factor in the crisis of 1917, but only a secondary part of the power struggle of the state.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=95&ndash;98, 109&ndash;114}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1986|pp=165&ndash;167}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=163&ndash;164, 192}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=155, 197, 203&ndash;225}}</ref>

====Battle for leadership====  
The power struggle between the Social Democrats and the conservatives culminated in July 1917 in the passing of the Senate bill that eventually became the "Power Act", which incorporated a plan by the Social Democrats to substantially increase the power of Parliament, in which they had a majority; it also furthered Finnish independence by restricting Russia's influence on domestic Finnish affairs. The Social Democrats' plan had the backing of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the Russian Bolsheviks, who in July 1917 were plotting a revolt against the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. The Agrarian Union, some rightist activists, and other non-socialists eager for Finnish sovereignty supported the act, but both the Finnish conservatives and the Russian Provisional Government opposed the measure because it would reduce their power. In the event, Lenin was thwarted during the "[[July Days]]" and forced to flee to Finland. The Provisional Russian Government refused to accept the Power Act and sent troops to Finland, where, with the support of the conservatives, Parliament was dissolved and new elections announced. In those [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1917|elections, in October 1917]], the Social Democrats lost their absolute majority, after which the labour movement's role changed. Until then, it had mainly struggled for new rights and benefits for its members; now the movement was forced to defend the gains it had already made.<ref>{{Harvnb|Enckell|1956}}, {{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=163&ndash;194}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=158&ndash;162, 195&ndash;196}}, {{Harvnb|Ker<U+00E4>nen|1992|p=50}}</ref>

The collapse of Russia in the February Revolution resulted in a loss of institutional authority in Finland and the dissolution of the police force, creating fear and uncertainty. In response, groups on both the right and left began assembling independent security groups for their own protection. At first, these groups were local and largely unarmed, but by autumn 1917, in the power vacuum following the dissolution of parliament and in the absence of a stable government or a Finnish army, such forces began assuming a more military and national character.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=195&ndash;230}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1986|p=166&ndash;167}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=237&ndash;243}}</ref> The Civil Guards (later called the [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]]) were organized by local men of influence, usually conservative academics, industrialists and major landowners and activists, while the Worker's Security Guards (later called the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]]) were often recruited through their local party sections and the labour unions. The presence of these two opposing armed forces in the country imposed a state of <U+201C>dual power" and "multiple sovereignty" on Finnish society, typically the prelude to civil war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=195&ndash;230}}, {{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981}}, {{Harvnb|Salkola|1985}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=151&ndash;167}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1993}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=237&ndash;243}}</ref>

===October Revolution (1917)===
{{See also|October Revolution}}

Lenin's [[Bolshevik]] [[October Revolution|Revolution]] on 7 November transferred political power to the radical, left-wing socialists in Russia, a turn of events which suited a German Empire exhausted by fighting a war on two major fronts. The policy of the German leaders had been to foment unrest or revolution in Russia in order to force the Russians to sue for peace. To that end, they had arranged for the safe conduct of Lenin and his comrades from exile in [[Switzerland]] to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] in April 1917. Furthermore, the Germans financed the Bolshevik party, believing Lenin to be the most powerful weapon they could launch at Russia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ker<U+00E4>nen|1992|p=36}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2000|p=86<U+2013>95}}</ref>

After the dissolution of the Finnish parliament, the polarization and mutual fear between the Social Democrats and the conservatives increased dramatically, a situation made worse when the latter, after their victory in the elections of October 1917, appointed a purely conservative cabinet. On 1 November, the Social Democrats put forward a political program called "We demand" in order to push for political concessions in domestic policy. They planned also to ask for acceptance of Finland's sovereignty from the Bolsheviks in the form of a manifesto on 10 November, but the uncertain situation in Petrograd stalled the plan. After the uncompromising  "We demand" program had failed, the socialists initiated a [[general strike]] on 14&ndash;19 November 1917. At this moment, Lenin and the Bolsheviks, under threat in Petrograd, urged the Social Democrats to seize power in Finland, but the majority of the latter were moderate and preferred parliamentary methods, prompting Lenin to label them "reluctant revolutionaries". When the general strike appeared to be successful, the "Workers' Revolutionary Council" voted by a narrow majority to seize power on 16 November at 5 a.m. The supreme revolutionary "Executive Committee", however, was unable to recruit enough members to carry out the plan and had to call the proposed revolution off at 7 p.m. the same day. The incident, "the shortest revolution", effectively split the Social Democrats in two, a majority supporting parliamentary means and a minority demanding revolution. The repercussions of the event had a lasting effect on the future of the movement, with several powerful leaders staking positions within the party.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ketola|1987|pp=368&ndash;384}}, {{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=264&ndash;342}}</ref>

The Finnish Parliament, influenced by the general strike, supported the Social Democratic proposals for an eight-hour working day and universal suffrage in local elections on 16 November 1917. During the strike, however, radical elements of the Workers' Security Guards executed several political opponents in the main cities of [[southern Finland]], and the first armed clashes between Civil Guards and Workers' Guards broke out, with 34 reported casualties. The Finnish Civil War would probably have started at that point had there been enough weapons in the country to arm the two sides; instead, there began a race for weapons and a final escalation towards war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=317&ndash;342}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=167&ndash;171}}</ref>

===Finnish sovereignty===
The disintegration of Russia offered the Finns a historic opportunity to gain independence, but after the October Revolution, the positions of the conservatives and the Social Democrats on the sovereignty issue had become reversed. The right was now eager for independence because sovereignty would assist them in controlling the left and in minimizing the influence of revolutionary Russia.  The Social Democrats had supported independence since spring 1917, but now they could not use it for the direct political benefit of their party and had to adjust to the right's dominance in the country. Nationalism had become a "civic religion" among the Finns by the end of the nineteenth century, and during 1917 sovereignty was one of the few political questions on which most of the Finnish people agreed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=89&ndash;100}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=9&ndash;10}}</ref>

[[Image:Ven tunnustaa Suomen itsenisyyden.png|thumb|left|The Bolshevik government's recognition of Finnish independence was the first concrete expression of Lenin's demand for the right of nations to [[self-determination]].]]
 
The Senate, led by [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]], proposed [[Finland's declaration of independence]], which the Parliament adopted on 6 December 1917.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ker<U+00E4>nen|1992|p=73}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|p=236}}</ref> Though the Social Democrats voted against the Svinhufvud proposal, they decided to present an alternative declaration of independence containing no substantial differences. The socialists feared a further loss of support (as in the October elections) among the nationalistic common people and hoped to win a political majority in the future. They sent two delegations during December 1917 to Petrograd in order to appeal from Lenin an approval of Finnish independence. Both political groups, therefore, agreed on the need for Finnish sovereignty, despite strong disagreement on the selection of its leadership.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=343&ndash;382}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=189&ndash;192}}, {{Harvnb|Ker<U+00E4>nen|1992|p=78}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1993 }}, {{Harvnb|Jutikkala, E. in: Aunesluoma & H<U+00E4>iki<U+00F6>|1995|pp=11&ndash;20, Uta.fi/Suomi80}}</ref>

The establishment of sovereignty was not a foregone conclusion; for a small nation like Finland, recognition by Russia and the major [[great power|European powers]] was essential. Three weeks after the declaration of independence, Svinhufvud's cabinet concluded that it would have to negotiate with Lenin for Russian recognition. During December 1917, the Bolsheviks were under pressure in peace negotiations with Germany at [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]]. Russia Bolshevism was in a deep crisis with a demoralized army and the fate of the October Revolution in doubt. Lenin calculated that the Bolsheviks could perhaps hold central parts of Russia but would have to give up some territories on its periphery, including Finland in the less important north-western corner. As a result, Svinhufvud and his senate delegation won Lenin's concession of sovereignty on 31 December 1917.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=258&ndash;261}}, {{Harvnb|Ker<U+00E4>nen|1992|p=79}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=183&ndash;197}}</ref>

==Warfare==
[[Image:Suojeluskunta.jpg|thumb|220px|White Guard in Nummi. [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]] were mobilized on 28.01., at 3 a.m. and the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] on 27.01.1918, at 11 p.m.]]

===Escalation===
In hindsight the events of 1917 have been often seen simply as precursors of the Civil War, an escalation of the conflict starting with the February Revolution. But the opposing political factions made many failed attempts of their own to create a new order and prevent social breakdown in 1917.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|p=232}}</ref> The events of the general strike in November deepened the suspicion and mistrust in Finland and finally put the possibility of compromise out of reach. The conservatives and rightist activists saw the groups of radical workers active during the strike as a threat to the security of the former estates and the political right, so they resolved to use all means necessary to defend themselves, including armed force. At the same time, revolutionary workers and left-wing socialists were now considering removing the conservative regime by force rather than allowing the achievements of the workers' movement to be reversed. The result of this hardening of positions was that in late 1917, moderate, peaceful men and women, as so often throughout history, were forced to stand aside while the men with rifles stepped forward to take charge.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=517&ndash;518}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=185&ndash;196}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1993|pp=15&ndash;24}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=221, 223&ndash;225}}, {{Harvnb|Jutikkala|Pirinen|2003|pp=389}}</ref>

The final escalation towards war began in early January 1918. The most radical Workers' Security Guards from [[Helsinki]], [[Kotka]] and [[Turku]] changed their names to Red Guards and convinced those leaders of the Social Democrats who wavered between peace and war to support revolution. The Workers' Guards were officially renamed the Red Guards at the end of the same month, under the command of [[Ali Aaltonen]], a former Russian army officer, who had been appointed in December. At the same time, the Svinhufvud [[Senate of Finland|Senate]] and the Parliament decided on 12 January 1918 to create a strong police authority, an initiative which the Workers' Security Guards saw as a step towards legalizing the White Guards. When the Senate renamed the White Guards the Finnish White Army, the Red Guards refused to recognise the title. On 15 January, [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]], like Aaltonen a former officer in the Russian army, was appointed supreme commander of the White Guards. He located his headquarters in [[Vaasa]], while Aaltonen located his in Helsinki.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=390&ndash;500}}, {{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981}}, {{Harvnb|Ker<U+00E4>nen|1992|pp=80&ndash;87}}</ref>

The official starting date of the Finnish Civil War is a matter for debate. The first serious battles were fought during 17&ndash;20 January in [[Viipuri province]], in the south-eastern corner of Finland, mainly for control of the town of [[Viipuri]] and to win the race for weapons. The White Order to engage was issued on 25 January; the Red Order of Revolution was issued on 26 January. The next day, the White Guards attacked trains carrying a large shipment of weapons from Russia, as promised to the Reds by Lenin. The large scale mobilization of the Red Guards began in the late evening of 27 January, followed by the corresponding act of the White Guards, with disarmament of Russian garrisons in [[Ostrobothnia]] during the early hours of 28 January. A symbolic date for the start of the war could be 26 January, when a group of Reds climbed the tower of Helsinki Workers' Hall and lit a red lantern to mark the start of the second major rebellion in the history of Finland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|p=471&ndash;515}}, {{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981}}</ref>

===Brothers in arms===
[[Image:FinnishCivilWarMapBegin.svg|thumb|240px|Initial frontlines and offensives of the Civil War at the beginning of February (area controlled by the Reds in red, and by the Whites in blue)]]

At the beginning of the war, the [[front line]] ran through southern Finland from west to east, dividing the country into White Finland and Red Finland. The Red Guards controlled the area to the south, including nearly all the major industrial centres and the largest estates and farms with high numbers of [[croft (land)|crofters]] and [[tenant farmer]]s; the White Army controlled the area to the north, which was predominantly agrarian with small or medium-sized farms and tenant farmers, and where crofters were few or held a better social position than in the south. Enclaves of the opposing forces existed on both sides of the front line: within the White area lay the industrial towns of [[Varkaus]], [[Kuopio]], [[Oulu]], [[Raahe]], [[Kemi]] and [[Tornio]]; within the Red area lay [[Porvoo]], [[Kirkkonummi]] and [[Uusikaupunki]]. The elimination of these strongholds was a priority for both armies during February 1918.

Red Finland, later named the [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic]], was led by the People's Council in Helsinki. [[Kullervo Manner]] was the chairman and other members included [[Otto Ville Kuusinen]] and Yrj<U+00F6> Sirola.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jussila|Hentil<U+00E4>|Nevakivi|1999|pp=108}}</ref> [[Bolshevist Russia]] declared its support for Red Finland, but the Reds' vision of [[democratic socialism]] for the country did not resemble Lenin's [[dictatorship of the proletariat]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Ker<U+00E4>nen|1992|p=102}}</ref>. Lenin  tried to prevent disintegration of Russia, but he failed, and many minor, western territories of the former empire declared independency. The majority of the Finnish Social Democrats supported Finland's sovereignty;<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=263&ndash;278}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1993}}</ref>, however, the Red Guards dominated the politics of Red Finland with their weapons, and the most radical Guards and the Finnish Bolsheviks, though few in number, obviously favoured annexation of Finland back to Russia. This major question vanished in the air due to the defeat of Red Finland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=255&ndash;265}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1993}}</ref> The Finnish senate (''the Vaasa Senate'') relocated to the west-coast city of [[Vaasa]], which acted as the capital of [[White Finland]] from 29 January to 3 May, and looked to Germany for military and political aid. Mannerheim agreed on the need for German weapons but opposed any help from German troops in Finland. The conservatives planned a monarchist political system, with a lesser role for Parliament. A section of the conservatives had always been against democracy; others had approved [[parliamentary system|parliamentarianism]] at first but after the crisis of 1917 and the outbreak of war had concluded that empowering the common people would not work. Moderate non-socialists opposed any restriction of parliamentarianism and initially resisted German military help, but prolonged warfare changed their stance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=62&ndash;64}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|1998|pp=38&ndash;46, 56&ndash;79}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2000}}</ref> The Finnish Civil War was fought along the railways, the vital means of transporting troops and supplies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1993|pp=15&ndash;21}}</ref> The Red Guards' first objective was to cut the Whites' east-west rail connection, which they attempted north-east of Tampere, at the Battle of Vilppula. They also unsuccessfully tried to eliminate the Whites' bridgehead south of the [[Vuoksi River|River Vuoksi]] at Antrea on the [[Karelian Isthmus]], a threat to their rail connection with Russia.

[[Image:FinnishCivilWarMapMiddle.svg|thumb|220px|The main offensives to the end of March. Whites besiege Tampere and encircle attacking Soviet Russian and Red forces at Rautu, on Karelian Isthmus.]]

The number of troops on each side varied from 50,000 to 90,000. While the Red Guards consisted mostly of volunteers, the White Army contained only 11,000&ndash;15,000 volunteers, the remainder being [[conscription|conscripts]]. The main motives for volunteering were economic factors (salary, food), idealism, and peer pressure. The Red Guards also included 2,000 female troops, mostly young girls, recruited from the industrial centres of southern Finland. Both armies used juvenile soldiers, mainly between 15 and 17 years of age, the most famous example being [[Urho Kekkonen]] who fought for the White Army and later became the longest-serving [[President of Finland]]. Urban and agricultural workers constituted the majority of the Red Guards, whereas land-owning farmers and well-educated people formed the backbone of the White Army.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1992<U+2013>1993}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen, O. in: Aunesluoma|H<U+00E4>iki<U+00F6>|1995|pp=21&ndash;32}}</ref>

[[Image:FinnishCivilWarMapEnd.svg|thumb|220px|The German intervention (grey) and final offensives of the War]]

===Red Guards and the Russian troops===
The Red Guards seized the early initiative in the war, taking control of [[Helsinki]], the Finnish capital, in the early hours of 28 January, and gaining first advantage with an "attack phase" that lasted till mid-March. However, a chronic shortage of skilled leaders, both at command level and in the field, left them unable to capitalize on their initial momentum, and most of the offensives finally came to nothing. The troops of the Red Guards were not professional soldiers but armed civilians, whose military training and discipline were mostly inadequate to resist the counter-attack of the White Army when it came, still less the onslaught of the German forces who arrived later. Consequently, Ali Aaltonen found himself rapidly replaced in command by [[Eero Haapalainen]], who in turn was replaced by the triumvirate of [[Eino Rahja]], [[Adolf Taimi]] and [[Evert Eloranta]]. The last commander of the Red Guards was [[Kullervo Manner]], who led the final retreat into Russia. The only victories of the Finnish Red Guards were the heavy battles against German troops at [[Hauho]] and [[Tuulos]], Syrj<U+00E4>ntaka, on 28&ndash;29 April 1918, during their retreat from southern Finland towards Russia, but these conflicts had only local importance by then.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=227&ndash;255}}, {{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981}}</ref>

[[Image:Red officers.jpg|thumb|left|Red officers on their horses]]

Although some 60,000 to 80,000 Russian soldiers of the former Tsar's army remained stationed in Finland at the start of the Civil War, the Russian contribution to the Red Guards' cause was to prove negligible. When the conflict began, Lenin tried to commit the army on behalf of Red Finland, but the troops were demoralized and war-weary after years of World War I. The majority of the soldiers had returned to Russia by the end of March 1918. As a result, only 7,000 to 10,000 troops participated in the Finnish Civil War, of which no more than 4,000, in separate small units, could be persuaded to fight in the front line. Despite the involvement of a few skilled old Russian army officers such as Mikhail Svechnikov, who led the battles in western Finland throughout February 1918, it seems reasonable to assume that the Russian troops had no significant influence on the course of the war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=265&ndash;276}}, {{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen, O. in: Aunesluoma & H<U+00E4>iki<U+00F6>|1995|pp=21&ndash;32}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2006}}</ref> The number of Russian soldiers active in the Civil War declined markedly once Germany attacked Russia on 18 February 1918. The [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], signed between Russia and Germany on 3 March, effectively restricted the Bolsheviks' ability to support the Finnish Red Guards with anything more than weapons and supplies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=259&ndash;262}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1992<U+2013>1993}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2000}}</ref> The Russians did remain active on the south-eastern front, however, defending the approaches to Petrograd.

===White Guards and the German Army===
The military quality of the common soldier in the White Army differed little from that of his counterpart in the Red Guards, with brief and inadequate training provided for most of the troops.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=62&ndash;144}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=25&ndash;30}}</ref> But the White Army had two major advantages over the Red Guards: the professional military leadership of General Mannerheim and his staff<U+2014>which included 84 Swedish volunteer officers as well as former Finnish officers of the Tsar's army<U+2014>and approximately 1,300 [[Finnish J<U+00E4>ger troops|"J<U+00E4>ger" ''(J<U+00E4><U+00E4>k<U+00E4>rit)'']] elite Finnish troops, trained in Germany and battle-hardened on the Eastern Front.

====Battle of Tampere====
[[Image:Tampere war victims 1918.jpg|thumb|270px|Unburied bodies <U+2013> outcome of the [[Battle of Tampere]]]]

Mannerheim's strategy was to strike first at [[Tampere]], Finland's most important industrial town in the south-west. He launched the attack on 16 March at [[L<U+00E4>ngelm<U+00E4>ki]], 65 [[kilometre|km]] north-east of Tampere; at the same time the White Army began advancing along a line through Vilppula<U+2013>Kuru<U+2013>Kyr<U+00F6>skoski<U+2013>Suodenniemi, north and north-west of Tampere. The Red Guards collapsed under the weight of the assault, and some of its detachments retreated in panic. The White Army cut off the Red Guards' retreat south of Tampere in [[Lemp<U+00E4><U+00E4>l<U+00E4>]] and lay siege to Tampere on 24 March, entering the town four days later. The true [[Battle of Tampere]] began on 28 March, later called the "bloody Maundy Thursday" on the eve of Easter 1918. The battle for Tampere was fought between 16,000 White and 14,000 Red soldiers, and it was the decisive action of the war and the largest military engagement in Scandinavian history to that point. It was Finland's first [[urban warfare|urban battle]], fought in the Kalevankangas graveyard and from house-to-house in the city as the Red Guards retreated. The battle, lasting until 6 April 1918, was the bloodiest action of the war; the motivation to fight for defence had increased markedly among the Reds, and the Whites had to use part of the fresh, best trained detachments of their army.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1993|pp=429&ndash;443}}</ref> The fighting in Tampere was pure civil war, Finn against Finn, "brother rising against brother", since most of the Russian army had retreated to Russia in March and the German troops had yet to arrive in Finland. The White Army lost 700&ndash;900 men, including 50 J<U+00E4>gers. The Red Guards lost 1,000&ndash;1,500 soldiers, with a further 11,000<U+2013>12,000 imprisoned. 71 civilians died mainly due to artillery fire. The eastern parts of the city, with wooden buildings, were destroyed completely.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1993|pp=103&ndash;295}}, {{Harvnb|Aunesluoma|H<U+00E4>iki<U+00F6>|1995|pp=92&ndash;97}}, {{Harvnb|Hoppu|2007|pp=12&ndash;35}}</ref>

After their defeat in Tampere, the Red Guards retreated eastwards. The White Army shifted its military focus to [[Vyborg|Viipuri]], Karelia's main city, taking it on 29 April. The Red Guards' last strongholds in south-west Finland fell by 5 May.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981}}, {{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=424&ndash;446}}, {{Harvnb|Aunesluoma|H<U+00E4>iki<U+00F6>|1995|p=112}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2000}}</ref>

====German intervention====
[[Image:SaksalaisiaHelsingissa.jpg|thumb|left|230px|German [[Maschinengewehr 08]]-machine gun position in Helsinki]]

The German Empire finally intervened in the Finnish Civil War on the side of the White Army in March 1918. The activists had been seeking German aid in freeing Finland from Russian hegemony since Autumn 1917, but the Germans did not want to prejudice their armistice and [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk#Armistice negotiations|peace negotiations]] with Russia, the latter beginning on 22 December at [[Brest, Belarus|Brest-Litovsk]]. The German stance altered radically after 10 February when [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]], despite the weakness of the Bolsheviks' position, broke off negotiations, hoping revolutions would break out in the German Empire and change everything. The German government promptly decided to teach Russia a lesson and, as a pretext for aggression, invited <U+201C>requests for help<U+201D> from the smaller countries west of Russia. Representatives of the Vaasa Senate in [[Berlin]] duly requested help on 14 February.<ref> On 7 March, representatives Hjelt and Erich agreed to pay the military costs of German military assistance. {{Harvnb|Jussila|Hentil<U+00E4>|Nevakivi|1999|pp=117}}</ref> The Germans attacked Russia on 18 February.

On March 5 a German Naval squadron landed on the [[<U+00C5>land|<U+00C5>land Islands]] in the southwestern archipelago of Finland, where a Swedish military expedition had been protecting Swedish interests and the Swedish-speaking population since mid-February.<ref>The Swedish troops were forced to leave the area by May. {{Harvnb|Jussila|Hentil<U+00E4>|Nevakivi|1999|pp=117}}</ref> On 3 April 1918, the 10,000-strong [[Baltic Sea Division]] led by [[R<U+00FC>diger von der Goltz]] struck west of Helsinki at [[Hanko]], and on 7 April, the 3,000-strong [[Detachment Brandenstein]] overran the town of [[Loviisa]] on the south-eastern coast. The main German formations then advanced rapidly eastwards from Hanko and took Helsinki on 13 April. At the same time, two German battleships and smaller vessels entered the city harbour and bombarded the Red positions, which included the present-day [[Presidential Palace, Helsinki|Presidential Palace]]. The Brandenstein Brigade attacked the town of [[Lahti]] on 19 April, cutting the connection between the western and eastern Red Guards. The main German detachment advanced northwards from Helsinki and took [[Hyvink<U+00E4><U+00E4>]] and [[Riihim<U+00E4>ki]] on April 21&ndash;22, followed by [[H<U+00E4>meenlinna]] on 26 April. The efficient performance of the German top detachments in the civil war contrasted strikingly with that of the demoralized Russian troops.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=369&ndash;424}}, {{Harvnb|Arimo|1991}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1992<U+2013>1993}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2000}}</ref>

Most members of the People's Deputation of Finland fled from Helsinki on 8 April and from [[Vyborg|Viipuri]] to Petrograd on 25 April, with only [[Edvard Gylling]] remaining in Viipuri. The Finnish Civil War ended on 14&ndash;15 May, when a small number of Russian troops retreated from a [[coastal artillery]] base on the [[Karelian Isthmus]]. White Finland celebrated its victory in Helsinki on 16 May 1918.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ker<U+00E4>nen|1992|p=137}}</ref>

===Red and White terror===
[[Image:FiringsquadLankipohja.jpg|thumb|White firing squad executing Red soldiers in L<U+00E4>nkipohja|250px]]

During the civil war, the White Army and the Red Guards both perpetrated acts of terror. According to earlier views, both sides had agreed to certain [[rules of engagement]], but violations occurred from the start, most notably when Red Guards executed 17 troops at [[Suinula]] village on 31 January, and when White Army soldiers executed 90 troops at [[Varkaus]] on 21 February. After these incidents, both sides began carrying out revenge executions at local level, a trend which escalated to massacres and [[terrorism]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Paavolainen|1966}}, {{Harvnb|Ker<U+00E4>nen|1992|pp=89, 101}}, {{Harvnb|Uola|1998}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2004|pp=232&ndash;240}}</ref>

Recent studies indicate, however, that the terror was a calculated part of the general warfare. The highest staffs of both sides planned these actions and gave orders to the lower level. At least a third of the Red terror and perhaps most of the White terror was centrally led. The governments of White Finland and Red Finland officially opposed acts of terror, but such operational decisions were made at the military level.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tikka|2004|pp=452&ndash;460}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=69&ndash;138}}</ref>

Both armies deployed "flying detachments" of [[cavalry]], usually consisting of 10 to 80 troops aged 15 to 20, under the absolute authority of an experienced adult leader. These units, which specialized in [[search and destroy|search-and-destroy]] operations behind the front lines and during and after battles, have been described as [[death squad]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=69&ndash;81,141&ndash;146}}</ref>

The Red Guards executed those they considered the main leaders of White Finland or as class enemies, including industrialists, politicians and major landowners. The two major sites of the Red terror were [[Toijala]] and [[Kouvola]]; there 300<U+2013>350 Whites were executed between February and April 1918. The White Guards executed Red Guard and party leaders and those who participated in the war and [[Red Terror|Red terror]]. During the peak of the White terror, between the end of April and the beginning of May, 200 Reds were shot per day. The White terror hit particularly strongly the Russian soldiers who fought with the Red Guards.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ker<U+00E4>nen|1992|pp=121, 138}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2004|pp=96&ndash;108, 214&ndash;291}}</ref>

In total, 1,400&ndash;1,650 Whites were executed in the Red terror, and 7,000&ndash;10,000 Reds were executed in the [[White Terror|White terror]]. The breakdown of the rules of engagement in the Finnish Civil War conformed to a pattern observed in many other civil wars.<ref>The Red casualties included 300<U+2013>400 female soldiers,  {{Harvnb|Paavolainen|1966 and 1967}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1992&ndash;1993}}, {{Harvnb|Eerola|Eerola|1998|pp=59, 91}}, {{Harvnb|Westerlund|2004|pp=15}}</ref>

[[Image:Civil War Prison Camp in Helsinki.gif|thumb|270px|Prison camp in [[Suomenlinna]], Helsinki. More than 11,000 people died in such camps due to hunger, disease, and executions.]]

===Bitter legacy===
The Civil War was a catastrophe for the Finnish nation. Almost 37,000 people perished, 5,900 of whom (16% of the total) were between 14 and 20 years old. A notable feature of the war was that only about 10,000 of these casualties occurred on the battlefields; most of the deaths resulted from the terror campaigns and from the appalling conditions in the prison camps. In addition, the war left about 20,000 children orphaned. A large number of Red Finland supporters fled to Russia at the end of the war and during the period that followed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|p=447&ndash;481}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=9&ndash;13, 212&ndash;217}}, {{Harvnb|Peltonen|2003|pp=9&ndash;24, 214&ndash;220}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2004|pp=452&ndash;460}}, ''[http://vesta.narc.fi/cgi-bin/db2www/sotasurmaetusivu/main?lang=en War victims in Finland 1914&ndash;1920]''</ref>

The war created a legacy of bitterness, fear, hatred, and desire for revenge, and deepened the divisions within Finnish society. The conservatives and liberals disagreed strongly on the best [[form of government|system of government]] for Finland to adopt: the former demanded monarchy and restricted parliamentarianism; the latter demanded a Finnish republic with full-scale democracy and social reforms. A new conservative Senate, with a monarchist majority, was formed by [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi|J.K. Paasikivi]].<ref name = "jojowe">{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=447&ndash;453}}, {{Harvnb|Ker<U+00E4>nen|1992|p=136}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1992<U+2013>1993}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|1998|pp=56&ndash;79}}</ref> All members of parliament who had taken part in the revolt were removed from office. This left only one social democrat later to be joined by two more.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jussila|Hentil<U+00E4>|Nevakivi|1999|pp=121}}</ref> A major consequence of the 1918 conflict was the breakup of the Finnish worker movement into three parts: moderate Social Democrats, left-wing socialists in Finland, and communists acting in Soviet Russia with the support of the Bolsheviks.<ref name = "jojowe"/>

In foreign policy, White Finland looked to Germany and its military might for support, and at the end of May the Senate asked the Germans to remain in the country. The agreements signed with Germany on 7 March 1918 in return for military support had bound Finland politically, economically, and militarily to the German Empire. The Germans proposed a further military pact in summer 1918 as a part of their plan to secure raw materials for German industry from eastern Europe and tighten their control over Russia. General Mannerheim resigned his post on 25 May after disagreements with the Senate about German hegemony over the country and about his planned attack on Petrograd to repulse the Bolsheviks, which the Germans opposed under the peace treaty signed with Lenin at Brest-Litovsk. On 9 October, under pressure from Germany, the monarchist Senate and the rump parliament chose a German prince, [[Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse|Friedrich Karl]], brother-in-law of [[William II, German Emperor|German Emperor William II]], to be the King of Finland<U+2014>and Finland approached the status of [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|a monarchistic state]]. All these measures diminished Finnish sovereignty. The Finns, both right and left, had achieved independence on 6 December 1917 without a gunshot but then compromised that independence by allowing the Germans to enter the country without difficulty during the civil war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rautkallio|1977}}, {{Harvnb|Upton|1981|p=480}}, {{Harvnb|Ker<U+00E4>nen|1992|p=152}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1992<U+2013>1993}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|1998|pp=199&ndash;249}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=276&ndash;291}}</ref>

The economic condition of the country had deteriorated so drastically that recovery to pre-conflict levels was not achieved until 1925. The most acute crisis was in the food supply, already deficient in 1917, though starvation had at that time been avoided in southern Finland. The Civil War, according to the leaders of Red Finland and White Finland, would solve all past problems; instead it led to starvation in southern Finland too. Late in 1918, Finnish politician [[Rudolf Holsti]] appealed for relief to [[Herbert Hoover]], the chairman of the [[BAEF|Commission for Relief in Belgium]]: Hoover arranged for food shipments and persuaded the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] to relax their blockade of the [[Baltic Sea]] (which had obstructed food supplies to Finland) to allow the food in.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ker<U+00E4>nen|1992|p=157}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=9&ndash;13, 212&ndash;217}}</ref>

====Prison camps====
The White Army and German troops captured about 80,000 Red prisoners by the end of the war on 5 May 1918. Once the White terror subsided, a few thousand including mainly small children and women, were set free, leaving 74,000<U+2013>76,000 prisoners. The largest [[List of concentration and internment camps#Finland|prison camps]] were [[Suomenlinna]], an island facing Helsinki, [[H<U+00E4>meenlinna]], [[Lahti]], [[Vyborg|Viipuri]], [[Eken<U+00E4>s]], [[Riihim<U+00E4>ki]] and [[Tampere]]. The Senate made the decision to keep these prisoners detained until each person's guilt could be examined. A law for a ''Tribunal of Treason'' was enacted on 29 May after a long dispute between the White army and the Senate of the proper trial method to adopt. The start of the heavy and slow process of trials was delayed further until 18 June 1918. The Tribunal did not meet all the standards of neutral justice, due to the mental atmosphere of White Finland after the war. Approximately 70,000 Reds were convicted, mainly for complicity to treason. Most of the sentences were lenient, however, and many got out on parole. Still 555 persons were sentenced to death, but only 113 were executed. The trials revealed also that some innocent persons had been imprisoned.<ref>{{Harvnb|Paavolainen|1971}}, {{Harvnb|Kekkonen|1991}}, {{Harvnb|Ker<U+00E4>nen|1992|pp=140, 142}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|Hentil<U+00E4>|Nevakivi|1999|pp=112}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=161&ndash;178}}, Uta.fi/Suomi80/Yhteiskunta/Valtiorikosoikeudet</ref> 

Combined with the severe food shortage, the mass imprisonment led to high mortality rates in the camps, and the catastrophe was compounded by a mentality of punishment, anger and indifference on the part of the victors. Many prisoners felt that they were abandoned also by their own leaders, who had fled to Russia. The condition of the prisoners had weakened rapidly during May, after food supplies had been disrupted during the Red Guards' retreat in April, and a high number of prisoners had been captured already during the first half of April in Tampere and Helsinki. As a consequence, 2,900 starved to death or died in June as a result of diseases caused by malnutrition and [[Spanish flu]], 5,000 in July, 2,200 in August, and 1,000 in September. The mortality rate was highest in the [[Eken<U+00E4>s]] camp at 34%, while in the others the rate varied between 5% and 20%. In total, between 11,000 and 13,500 Finns perished. The dead were buried in mass graves near the camps.<ref>{{Harvnb|Paavolainen|1971}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1992<U+2013>1993}}, {{Harvnb|Eerola|Eerola|1998|pp=114, 121, 123}}, {{Harvnb|Westerlund|2004|pp=115<U+2013>150}}, {{Harvnb|Linnanm<U+00E4>ki|2005}}</ref> The majority of the prisoners were paroled or pardoned by the end of 1918 after the change in the political situation.

In 1973, the Finnish government paid reparations to 11,600 persons imprisoned in the camps after the civil war.<ref>[http://www.tyark.fi/lists/1918kronologia.htm Vuoden 1918 kronologia.] Ty<U+00F6>v<U+00E4>en arkisto.

===Compromise===
Just as the fate of the Finns was decided outside Finland in Petrograd on 15 March 1917, so it was decided outside Finland again on 11 November 1918, this time in Berlin, as Germany accepted defeat in World War I. The grand plans of the German Empire had finally come to nothing, and revolution had spread among the German people due to lack of food, war-weariness, and defeat in the battles on the Western Front. German troops left Helsinki on 16 December, and Prince Friedrich Karl, who had not yet been crowned officially, left his post on 20 December. Finland's status altered from a monarchistic protectorate of the German Empire to an independent democratic republic on the model of the western democracies. The first local elections based on [[universal suffrage]] in the history of Finland were held during 17&ndash;28 December 1918, and the first parliamentary election after the Civil War on 3 March 1919. The [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] recognised Finnish sovereignty on 6&ndash;7 May 1919.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ker<U+00E4>nen|1992|p=154, 171}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1992<U+2013>1993}}</ref>

After the Civil War, in 1919 a moderate Social Democrat, [[V<U+00E4>in<U+00F6> Voionmaa]], wrote: "Those who still trust in the future of this nation must have an exceptionally strong faith. This young independent country has lost almost everything due to the war...." At the same time, a liberal non-socialist, the eventual first president of Finland, [[Kaarlo Juho St<U+00E5>hlberg|K.J. St<U+00E5>hlberg]], elected 25 July 1919, wrote: "It is urgent to get the life and development in this country back on the path that we had already reached in 1906 and which the turmoil of war turned us away from". He was supported in that aim by [[Santeri Alkio]], leader of the Agrarian Union and by moderate Finnish conservatives, such as [[Lauri Ingman]].<ref>St<U+00E5>hlberg, Ingman, Tokoi, and Miina Sillanp<U+00E4><U+00E4> with other moderate female politicians had desperately tried to avoid the war in Jan 1918 with a proposal for a new Senate including both non-socialist and socialist members, but they were run over, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=243, 249}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|1998|pp=58, 96&ndash;99}}</ref>

Together with other moderate politicians of the right and the left, the new partnership constructed a Finnish compromise which eventually delivered a stable and broad parliamentary democracy. This compromise was based both on the defeat of Red Finland in the Civil War and the fact that most of the political goals of White Finland had not been achieved. After the foreign forces left Finland, the Finns realised they had to get along with each other and that none of the main groups could be rejected completely from society. The reconciliation led to a slow and painful, but steady, national unification. The compromise has turned out to be surprisingly strong and appears permanent. From 1919 to 1991, Finnish democracy and sovereignty withstood challenges from both right-wing and left-wing radicalism, the crisis of [[World War II]], and pressure from the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=480&ndash;481}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1986|pp=169&ndash;172}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=243, 245&ndash;256}}</ref>

== The Civil War in literature ==
The first generally appreciated book in Finland concerning the war, ''Devout Misery'' ({{lang-fi|Hurskas kurjuus}}), was written by the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]-winner [[Frans Emil Sillanp<U+00E4><U+00E4>]] in 1919. Between 1959 and 1962, [[V<U+00E4>in<U+00F6> Linna]], in his trilogy ''[[Under the North Star]]'' ({{lang-fi|T<U+00E4><U+00E4>ll<U+00E4> Pohjant<U+00E4>hden alla}}), described the Civil War and the Second World War from the point of view of the common people. In poetry, [[Bertel Gripenberg]], who had volunteered for the white army, celebrated its cause in ''The Great Age'' ({{lang-sv|Den stora tiden}}) in 1928. [[Viljo Kajava]], who had experienced the horrors of the [[Battle of Tampere]] at the age of nine, presented a [[pacifism|pacifist]] view of the civil war in his ''Poems of Tampere 1918'' of the 1960s. Also [[Kjell West<U+00F6>]]'s epic novel ''[[Where We Once Went]]'' ({{lang-sv|D<U+00E4>r vi en g<U+00E5>ng g<U+00E5>tt}}) deals with the Finnish civil war, following individuals and families from both the red and white sides of the spectrum, before, during and after the war period.
