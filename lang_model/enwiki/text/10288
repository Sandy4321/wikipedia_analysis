A '''boom''' or a '''chain''' (also '''boom defence''', '''harbour chain''', '''river chain''', '''chain boom''', '''boom chain''' or variants) is an obstacle strung across a navigable stretch of water to control or block navigation.<ref name=gatehouse/> A boom would generally float on the surface, while a chain can be on the surface or below the water. A chain could be made to float with rafts, logs, ships or other wood, making the chain a boom as well.

Booms could be military in nature, with the goal of denying access to an enemy's ships; a modern example would be the [[anti-submarine net]]. Booms could also be used, especially along rivers, to force passing vessels to pay a toll.<ref>[http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/177643 Boom Towers, Norwich]</ref><ref name=gatehouse>{{cite web|title=Site types in the Gatehouse listings - Chain Tower |url=http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/key.html |publisher=Gatehouse |author= Philip Davis |date= May 7, 2012 |accessdate=October 17, 2013}}</ref>

Especially in medieval times, the end of a chain could be attached to a '''chain tower''' or '''boom tower'''. This would allow safe raising or lowering of the chain, as they were often heavily fortified.<ref name=gatehouse/> By raising or lowering a chain or boom, access could be selectively granted rather than simply rendering the stretch of water completely inaccessible. The raising and lowering could be accomplished by a [[windlass]] mechanism or a [[Capstan (nautical)|capstan]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Filling in the missing links on history of harbour chain |author=Bob Hind |url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/nostalgia/filling-in-the-missing-links-on-history-of-harbour-chain-1-4726442 |newspaper=[[The News (Portsmouth)|The News]] |date=January 27, 2013 |accessdate=October 17, 2013}}</ref>

Booms or chains could be broken by a sufficiently large or heavy ship, and this occurred on many occasions, including the [[Siege of Damietta (1218<U+2013>19)|Siege of Damietta]], the [[Raid on the Medway]] and the [[Battle of Vigo Bay]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gibbon|first=Edward|authorlink=Edward Gibbon|title=[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]], Volume 6|page=510}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=THE DUTCH IN THE MEDWAY - 1667|url=http://www.deruyter.org/CHATHAM_Wednesday_12th.html|publisher=M.A. de Ruyter Foundation|accessdate=October 21, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Hervey | first = Frederic | title = The Naval History of Great Britain: From the Earliest Times to the Rising of the Parliament in 1779| publisher=W Adlard | year = 1779| location = | pages = 77 | doi = | isbn = }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Long |first=WH |authorlink= |title=Medals of the British Navy and How They Were Won |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=HSUglhRBzFgC&dq=torbay+chain&source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate= |year=2010 |publisher=Lancer Publishers |location=Great Britain |isbn=9781935501275 |page=24}}</ref>{{ref|caveat|A}} Frequently, however, attackers would instead seize the defences and cut the chain or boom by more conventional methods. The boom at the [[siege of Londonderry]], for example, was cut by sailors in a [[longboat]]. 

As a key portion of defences, booms were usually heavily defended. This would involve shore-based chain towers, batteries or forts. In the [[Age of Sail]], a boom protecting a harbour could have several ships defending it with their [[broadside]]s, discouraging assaults on the boom. On some occasions, multiple booms would span a single stretch of water.

==Notes==
:A.{{note|caveat}} Some sources have the chain being dismantled instead of broken by a ship in the [[Siege of Damietta (1218<U+2013>19)|Siege of Damietta]] and in the [[Raid on the Medway]].
