"'''Today Is Your Day'''" is a song performed by Canadian singer-songwriter [[Shania Twain]]. It was self-penned by Twain and co-produced by the singer alongside [[David Foster]] and [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]]. The song was released on June 12, 2011 by [[Universal Music Group Nashville#Mercury Nashville|Mercury Nashville Records]], as a [[Promotional recording|promotional single]] to accompany the documentary television series ''[[Why Not? with Shania Twain]]'' (2011). The song marked Twain's first song release in over six years. Twain wrote the track for self-inspiration, during the development of ''Why Not? with Shania Twain''. To her, "Today Is Your Day" became the [[theme music|theme song]] for the series, expressing the purpose behind it via music. Despite feeling apprehensive, Twain decided to record the track, which induced her to create her forthcoming fifth studio album. The track is midtempo [[ballad (music)|ballad]] in the [[country pop]] genre (critics have stated it is rather pop music than country). Lyrically, "Today Is Your Day" regards personal upliftment.

"Today Is Your Day" has received mixed reviews from music critics and mild commercial performance in Canada and the United States. On the [[Canadian Hot 100]], the song peaked at number sixteen, while, in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], it peaked at number sixty-six. It became Twain's first effort to enter the main-genre chart since "[[Party for Two]]" (2004). Despite not receiving an official music video, a promotional music video was gathered from footage from ''Why Not? with Shania Twain''.

==Background==
In 1993, prior to success, Twain released her [[Shania Twain (album)|eponymous debut studio album]], which caught the attention of record producer [[Robert John "Mutt" Lange]]. The two collaborated on songwriting via phone calls for six months, and later established a romantic relationship. Soon after, they wedded in December 1993<ref name="accesshollywood">{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/shania-twain-husband-split-after-14-years-of-marriage_article_9525?|title=Shania Twain, Husband Split After 14 Years Of Marriage|date=May 15, 2008|work=[[Access Hollywood]]|publisher=[[NBC Universal Television Distribution]]|accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref> and Twain's second studio album ''[[The Woman in Me (Shania Twain album)|The Woman in Me]]'' (1995) established Twain as a superstar, selling over 12 million copies in the United States.<ref name="umgshania">{{cite web|url=http://www.umgnashville.com/artist/detail.aspx?nid=6613&aid=21|title=Shania Twain Was Inducted To The Canadian Music Hall Of Fame At The 2011 Juno Awards|date=January 12, 2011|work=''Umgnashville.com''|publisher=[[Universal Music Group Nashville]]|accessdate=August 7, 2011}}</ref> Twain and Lange continued to collaborate on her subsequent albums ''[[Come on Over (Shania Twain album)|Come on Over]]'' (1997) and ''[[Up!

She then began to re-evaluate her life and noted a pattern of attempting to withhold emotions, which affected her voice (for both speaking and singing).<ref name="whynotep5" /> She explained the loss of her voice was attributed to a cumulative stress that began with [[domestic violence]] in her childhood,<ref name="washingtonpost" /> continued with the death of her parents and the stress from her musical career,<ref name="mirror" /> and finally exploded with the divorce.<ref name="whynotep1" /> As a result, the singer developed [[dysphonia]], an impairment in the ability to produce voice sounds using the vocal organs as a result of tightened muscles enveloping her [[voice box]].<ref name="nationalpost" /> In order to recover her voice and heal wounds caused by the divorce, Twain embarked on a documented journey with the series ''[[Why Not? with Shania Twain]]''.<ref name="washingtonpost" /> The goal was executed via Twain performing acts out her comfort zone to once again be able to perform, while inspiring viewers to be proactive about their dilemmas.<ref name="whynotep1" />

==Writing and recording==
[[File:DavidFosterMar10.jpg|thumb|190px|[[David Foster]] (''pictured'') was the first producer Twain collaborated with since her divorce from [[Robert John "Mutt" Lange]].]]
After repeating to herself, 'Today is your day! You can do it!', Twain decided to compose a song for self-inspiration. Twain described the decision to write the song as crucial because it was her first since her separation from Lange. She had to "find [herself] as a songwriter again" and become independent once again.<ref name="whynotep1">{{cite episode|title=From This Moment On|accessdate=July 31, 2011|series=Why Not? with Shania Twain|serieslink=Why Not? with Shania Twain|credits=Shania Twain, Gay Rosenthal|network=OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network|airdate=May 8, 2011|season=1|seriesno=1|number=1}}</ref> "I was petrified of writing a new song without Mutt. A whole new world for me. It had been many, many years since I had written by myself so that was new and scary", Twain said.<ref name="cmt">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1665472/shania-twain-cant-wait-to-see-her-fans-in-las-vegas.jhtml|title=Shania Twain Can't Wait to See Her Fans in Las Vegas|first=Creg|last=Shelburne|date=June 8, 2011|work=''[[CMT News]]''|publisher=[[Viacom]]|accessdate=July 31, 2011}}</ref> For Twain, the music was simple to write, only occupying approximately two lines of [[sheet music]].<ref name="whynotep5">{{cite episode|title=Finding My Voice|accessdate=July 31, 2011|series=Why Not? with Shania Twain|credits=[[Shania Twain]], Gay Rosenthal|network=[[OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network]]|airdate=June 5, 2011|season=1|seriesno=1|number=1}}</ref> Then, the lyrics began to flow as ''Why Not? with Shania Twain'' progressed.<ref name="whynotep1" /> "Today Is Your Day" inspirited her; consequently, she contemplated sharing it with the series.<ref name="cmt" /> a concept that frightened her: "Sharing that song with other people, exposing, and basically allowing myself to be vulnerable the and judged, it scared the heck out of me."<ref name="whynotep5" /> She believed it ultimately became "the natural [[theme music|theme song]] of the series".<ref name="whynotep1" /> She explained the song's relevance to the television series: "From the inception of documenting the journey, the song was also created at that moment. And it has evolved with it all along the way."<ref name="whynotep5" />

As part of ''Why Not? with Shania Twain'', she then arranged an appointment with music producer [[David Foster]], hoping to collaborate on "Today Is Your Day".<ref name="whynotep5" /> In order to prepare with her session with Foster, Twain visited [[vocal coach]] Eric Vetro to prepare, although feeling skeptical. Twain and Vetro executed several vocal exercises to loosen her up from the tension and tightness she experienced. "The goal is to free up, to let go. She has to take all of that tension and tightness that she's been feeling for so long, and transform it to free herself from it. And to start singing from her heart again, the way she did when she was a little girl, when she started", Vetro stated.<ref name="whynotep5" /> He also expressed his belief that Twain was prepared enough to once again record and perform music. Twain felt she learned divergent techniques that were beneficial to her voice and appreciated Vetro's understanding of her psyche as a performer.<ref name="whynotep5" /> 

Nevertheless, Twain was apprehensive about collaborating with Foster and frightened that he would dislike the song or her voice. To ease the process, she approached it as if she were introducing "Today Is Your Day" to the producer as a songwriter, rather than a singer. Twain and Foster recorded the [[demo recording|demo]] of "Today Is Your Day" at Foster's [[recording studio|home studio]] in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], creating the [[musical arrangement]] as the recording prolonged.<ref name="whynotep5" /> [[Backing vocalist|Background vocal]]s were provided by Twain and her sister, Carrie Ann Twain, using a handheld microphone. Foster then suggested for Twain to record lead vocals in his home's vocal booth. After agreeing, Twain commenced it nervously, but then enjoyed it. She considered it a "landmark moment in [her] journey" through ''Why Not? with Shania Twain'' and described it as second nature and very natural, as if she never put her musical career to a halt.<ref name="whynotep5" /> Twain later recorded the studio version of "Today Is Your Day" and co-produced it along Foster and [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]].<ref name="cmt" /> The song "set [Twain] off", allowing her to feel comfortable anew recording music, and triggering her to create her forthcoming fifth studio album.<ref name="cmt" />

==Composition==
"Today Is Your Day" is a song with a length of three minutes and twelve seconds.<ref name="itunes" /> The song is a slow mid-tempo [[ballad (music)|ballad]] of the [[country pop]] genre.<ref name="hitfix" /><ref name="mtv" /> Nonetheless, several critics, such as Nicholas K<U+00F6>hler and Ken MacQueen ''[[Maclean's]]'', have described the track to be a piece of [[pop music]], rather than [[country music]].<ref name="about.com" /><ref name="macleans">{{cite web|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2011/06/17/newsmaker-june-2-9-2011-2/|title=Newsmakers: June 9 <U+2013> 16, 2011|first=Nicholas|last=K<U+00F6>hler|coauthors=Ken MacQueen|date=June 17, 2011|work=[[Maclean's]]|publisher=[[Rogers Communications]]|accessdate=July 29, 2011}}</ref> It commences with a sole [[piano]] accompanying Twain's voice, and later progresses to an assortment of [[banjo]], [[string instruments]], and other instrumentation.<ref name="hitfix" /> However, the production is maintained sparse, leaving Twain's vocals at center.<ref name="mtv" /> The lyrics are written in [[Second-person narrative|second person]] and discuss optimism<ref name="macleans" /> and personal upliftment.<ref name="hitfix" /> In the [[bridge (music)|bridge]], she sings, "Brush yourself off no regrets/ This is as good as it gets/ Don<U+2019>t expect more or less/ Just go out and give it your best", meaning one must be able to disregard dreaming for a better day because "today is all you<U+2019>ve got". Melinda Newman of [[HitFix]] presumed, considering Twain's back story, that Twain wrote "Today Is Your Day" as message for herself.<ref name="hitfix" />

===Critical reception===
The song received mixed reviews from music critics. Bill Lamb of [[About.com]] compared the track to work by [[Colbie Caillat]] and said it would have no problem conquering [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] radio, as well as country, while receiving minor [[airplay (radio)|airplay]] from mainstream stations.
