The '''Mosholu Parkway''' is a hybrid [[freeway]]-standard [[parkway]] and grade-level roadway in the [[borough (New York City)|New York City borough]] of [[the Bronx]], constructed from 1935 to 1937 as part of the roadway network created under [[Robert Moses]]. The roadway extends for {{convert|3.0|mi|1}} between the [[New York Botanical Garden]] (where its southeast end meets the [[Bronx River Parkway]]) and [[Van Cortlandt Park]] (where its northwest end meets the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]]). The [[New York City Department of Transportation]] is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the roadway while the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]] is responsible for the surrounding rights-of-way. The parkway is designated as '''New York State Route&nbsp;908F''' ('''NY&nbsp;908F'''), an unsigned [[reference route (New York)|reference route]], by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]].

The Mosholu Parkway begins at Interchange 8E of the Bronx River Parkway. It heads northward as an arterial boulevard through the northern parts of the Bronx. The highway crosses through Bedford Park, passing Bainbridge Avenue. It intersects with the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]] farther ahead, with [[Jerome Avenue]], Sedgwick Avenue and West [[Gun Hill Road]] soon after. In Van Cortlandt Park, the Mosholu Parkway becomes a limited-access freeway, with exits at the [[Major Deegan Expressway]] ([[Interstate&nbsp;87]] or I-87) (South only) and its terminus at the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]] just south of the [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] line where it turns into the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]].<ref name="yahoo"/>

A bikeway runs along the northeast side of the parkway from [[Bronx Park]] to [[Van Cortlandt Park]], connecting through the park to another bikeway on the former [[New York and Putnam Railroad]] line.<ref name="yahoo">{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=40.889533&lon=-73.882765&zoom=17&q1=40.86686%2C-73.873882&q2=40.902582%2C-73.888108 |title=overview map of the Mosholu Pakway |accessdate=June 6, 2008}}</ref>

== History ==
"Mosholu" is an Algonquin Indian word meaning "smooth stones" or "small stones", and was first applied to the nearby creek now known as Tibbett's Brook. The southern end of the parkway was once home to another creek, running under what is now Middlebrook Road, which supplied water to a British fort located on old Van Cortlandt Avenue East during the Revolutionary War.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=8778 |title=Mosholu Parkway |date=March 9, 2001 |publisher=[[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]] |accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref>

In the movie [[The Godfather Part II]], the young Vito Corleone arrives in America aboard a sailing ship named the ''Moshulu''.
