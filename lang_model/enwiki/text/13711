'''Albert Tissandier''' ([[1839]]&ndash;[[1906]]) was a [[France|French]] [[architect]], [[aviator]], [[illustrator]], [[editor]] and [[archaeologist]]. He was the brother of [[France|French]] adventurer [[Gaston Tissandier]] with whom he collaborated in writing the magazine ''[[La Nature]]'', a [[French language]] [[scientific journal]] aimed at the [[popular science|popularization of science]]. He and his brother demonstrated the first electric powered flight.

==Early years and ''La Nature''==
Born in [[Paris]] in [[1839]], Albert Tissandier was a loyal and assiduous companion of his brother, [[Gaston Tissandier]]. A distinguished [[architect]], he was involved in a large number of projects. 

Though his brother was nominally the sole founder of ''La Nature'', a [[scientific journal]] aimed at the [[popular science|popularization of science]], Albert contributed extensively to the magazine, mostly as an [[illustrator]] and [[editor]]. He was heavily involved in it from the very first issue in [[1873]] until his retirement in [[1905]], less than a year before his death.

==Aviation career==
His devotion to [[aeronautics]] began on [[November 8]], [[1868]], when he made his first [[hot air balloon]] ascent between [[Melun]] and [[Paris]] during a [[snowstorm]].

During the [[siege of Paris]] in the [[Franco-Prussian war]], Albert Tissandier piloted one of the first [[hot air balloon|mail balloons]] to outside the city. He escaped Paris on [[October 14]] [[1870]], in the gondola of the balloon ''Jean-Bart'', taking two other travellers in his care. Additionally, he carried 400 [[kg]] (1000 [[lbs]]) of mail and dispatches from 100 anxious families. He was awarded the [[M<U+00E9>daille militaire]] for his bravery.

===The Z<U+00E9>nith===

A few years later, the two brothers ascended on another [[hot air balloon]], this one called the [[Z<U+00E9>nith (balloon)|Z<U+00E9>nith]]. On [[March 23]] and [[March 24|24]] [[1875]] they flew from Paris to [[Arcachon]], on the other side of the country, near [[Bordeaux]], a total distance of 600 [[km]] (400 [[mi]]). During this ascent, he drew the countrysides below as naturally as possible. He also observed that when the moon passed above the clouds, the upper surface of the clouds shimmered like a lake, and recorded this in a drawing (right).

Only a few days after this ascent, on [[April 15]] at 11:35 AM, the Z<U+00E9>nith went up again, this time with only Gaston Tissandier, [[Joseph Croce-Spinelli]] and [[Th<U+00E9>odore Sivel]] with the goal of reaching an extreme height in order to continue their observations. They were able to reach the unheard of altitude of 8,600 m (28,000 feet). The latter became victims of their devotion to science dying from asphyxiation from the thin air. Gaston Tissandier himself became [[deaf]] and struggled with the problem for the rest of his life.

===First electric powered flight===
In [[1881]], the brothers Tissandier demonstrated the world's first electric powered flight at an electricity exposition by attaching an [[electric motor]] to a [[dirigible]]. It was after their first experiences with flight that they made the large model they demonstrated, for which Albert drew the [[blueprints]]. The first flight of an electric [[dirigible]] [[aerostat]] took place on [[October 8]] [[1883]]. They made a second attempt on [[September 26]] [[1884]] which gave them all the results they were looking for.

==Archaeology and travels==
Albert Tissandier was also a passionate writer and traveller. In [[1886]] he started a long trip around the world in [[Americas|America]], subsequently travelling to the [[East Indies]], [[Ceylon]] and many other [[Asia]]n locales, sending his magnificent illustrations back to Paris so they could appear in ''[[La Nature]]''.

In [[January]] of [[1890]], he was by the Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts on an [[archaeology|archaeological]] mission to [[India]], [[China]] and [[Japan]]. These travels occupied him for two years, and he gave a complete account of his travels, including remarkably exact and beautiful illustrations.

In [[1893]] and [[1894]], he visited [[Cambodia]] and [[Java]] including all the [[Khmer]] and [[Javanese]] ruins. Like his previous trip, he kept a record of precise and detailed illustrations and a large amount of remarkable [[artifacts]]. 

==Retirement and Death==
Following his travels, he at last returned to Paris and continued working extensively on ''[[La Nature]]''. Though his brother Gaston died on [[August 30]] [[1899]], he continued to be a large contributor to and [[editor]] of the magazine. He retired in [[1905]], dying on [[September 5]], [[1906]] at [[Juran<U+00E7>on]]. Many believed that the magazine would not be able to continue after his death.
