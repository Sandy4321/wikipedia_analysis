'''Lina Eve''' (born 1946) is an Australian artist, adoption activist, singer/songwriter, photographer and film maker, has been exhibiting and selling her work locally, nationally and internationally since 1994.

==Life and work==
Lina Eve was born in [[Germany]] to Polish parents in 1946. Her father was a [[Holocaust survivor]], and to escape war torn Europe, the family immigrated to Australia in 1951. At 17 years old, pregnant and unmarried, she lost her first child to [adoption] in 1964.

Leaving Australia to get over the trauma of losing her baby, Lina travelled back to Europe where she led a colorful and diverse life as a [[kibbutz]] worker in [[Israel]], a folk-singer in [[London]], a model in [[Greece]] and [[Paris]], and a silversmith travelling overland between Europe and the East. She<U+2019>s worked as a vegetarian cook in an Italian restaurant in [[India]], a civil marriage celebrant and counsellor in Australia, a singer/songwriter, photographer, visual artist, and most recently as a film maker.

Returning to [[Australia]] after 7 years in Europe and the East, Lina was involved in a car accident which killed 2 close friends and left her with multiple fractures and head injuries. After a long recovery period she moved to country [[Australia]], eventually having two more children, and building a house in a forest where she now lives with her husband and 5 cats.

Lina Eve started painting in 1994 studying [[Fine Arts]] at [[Southern Cross University]], in [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]], NSW, [[Australia]] and sold her first paintings in the same year. Her paintings have been selling locally, nationally and internationally ever since. Lina Eve<U+2019>s <U+201C>Bad Girl<U+201D> series, music and video<U+2019>s have enhanced her activism in [[adoption]] reform and along with her [[Holocaust]] series, <U+201C>Reclaiming my Family History<U+201D>  have led to  recognition in [[Australia]], the [[USA]] and Europe. Since she ventured into the world of film making, she recently won the Best Australian Music Video Award at the WOW Film Festival in Sydney 2009.
