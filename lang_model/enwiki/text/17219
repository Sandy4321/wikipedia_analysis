'''William Carroll''' ([[1788]]&ndash;[[1844]]) was [[List of Governors of Tennessee|Governor of Tennessee]] from [[1821]] to [[1827]] and again from [[1829]] to [[1835]]. He and [[John Sevier]] are the only two persons to serve twelve years (six two-year terms) in that office.

Like two of his predecessors, [[Archibald Roane]] and [[Joseph McMinn]], Carroll was a native of [[Pennsylvania]].  He came to [[Tennessee]] at the age of 18, and enjoyed considerable success in business prior to joining the militia in active service under [[Andrew Jackson]] in the [[War of 1812]].  He was a successful and popular soldier, and used this and his relationship with Jackson to launch his political career. Like his mentor he was a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]].

His governorship was noted for the establishment of a more progressive (for the era) [[Penal Code]] and the establishment of [[Chancery Court]]. [[Term limits]] prevented him from serving over three terms consecutively and in 1827 he was succeeded by [[Sam Houston]]; after Houston resigned as governor, Carroll successfully sought the office again and served three additional terms.  During his final term the [[state constitution]] of [[1796]] was supplanted by a new one which gave more executive power to the governor; although this document was technically superseded by the current one in [[1870]], that document carries over very many of the provisions of the [[1834]] constitution, upon which it was largely based.  Carroll served as governor of Tennessee longer than anyone else has to this point, even fellow six-term governor Sevier.  Sevier's first term was unusually short due to the time of year of the admission of Tennessee into the Union.  Carroll's gubernatorial service totalled 12 years and 12 days.

Carroll lived quietly after his terms as governor ended. [[Carroll County, Tennessee]] is named in his honor.

Father of Confederate General [[William Henry Carroll]].
