'''Princess M<U+00E1>xima of the Netherlands''' ([[n<U+00E9>e]] ''M<U+00E1>xima Zorreguieta Cerruti''; born [[May 17]], [[1971]]) is the spouse of [[heir apparent]] to the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|throne of the Netherlands]] [[Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange|Prince Willem-Alexander]]. 

==Early life and education==
Princess M<U+00E1>xima was born as M<U+00E1>xima Zorreguieta Cerruti in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] on [[May 17]], [[1971]]. M<U+00E1>xima is the daughter of Jorge Horacio Zorreguieta Stefanini (who would later be under-secretary of Agriculture under [[Jorge Rafael Videla|Jorge R. Videla]]'s ''[[Military dictatorship|junta]]''), and his second wife, Maria del Carmen Cerruti Carricart. She has two brothers, a sister and three half sisters.  A former [[investment bank]]er, she graduated with a degree in economics from the Universidad Cat<U+00F3>lica Argentina in [[1995]] before working for companies in [[Argentina]], [[New York]] and Europe.

==Relationship with Prince Willem-Alexander==
M<U+00E1>xima Zorreguieta and Prince Willem-Alexander met in [[April 1999]] in [[Sevilla, Spain]], during the [[Seville Spring Fair|Seville Fair]], also known as the "[[Feria]] de abril de Sevilla." This is an important annual event, to which many people from other countries come and dress in typical Spanish [[Andalusia]]n costume. In an interview, they stated that he introduced himself only as "Alexander," so that she did not know he was a prince. She thought he was joking when he told her he was a prince. They agreed to meet in [[New York City|New York]], where M<U+00E1>xima was working for [[Deutsche Bank]], two weeks later. Their relationship apparently began in New York, but the princess did not meet the Prince's parents, Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus, for some time. 

The news of the couple's [[personal relationship|relationship]] and eventual marriage plans caused a great deal of controversy in the [[Netherlands]]. M<U+00E1>xima's father had been minister of agriculture during the regime of former [[President of Argentina|Argentine President]] [[Jorge Rafael Videla]], a military [[dictator]] who ruled Argentina from [[1976]] to [[1981]] and who was responsible for many [[atrocity|atrocities]] against [[civilians]].  However, the research that the [[Staten-Generaal|Dutch Parliament]] conducted in order to decide whether M<U+00E1>xima Zorreguieta could become the  spouse of the future King determined that her father had not been directly involved with the many deaths in question. (An estimated 10,000<U+2013>30,000 people [[disappeared]] during this and subsequent military regimes before [[democracy]] was restored to [[Argentina]] in [[1983]]). Even so, his possible presence at the royal wedding was debated for several months.
{{Dutch Royal Family}} 
Prime Minister [[Wim Kok]] gained much respect for his careful negotiation of the situation. In the end, approval for the marriage was granted by the [[Dutch parliament]] (necessary by law for the [[Prince of Orange]] to remain heir to the throne), but M<U+00E1>xima's father offered not to attend the wedding. Out of solidarity with her husband, M<U+00E1>xima's mother also remained absent from the wedding on [[2 February]] [[2002]] in [[Amsterdam]].

==Change of nationality ==
M<U+00E1>xima was granted Dutch nationality on [[May 17]], [[2001]]. This provoked complaints since such a grant before marriage is not customary in the [[Netherlands]] (but required by Dutch law for a royal bride). Under normal circumstances, citizenship takes several years to obtain. The Princess has dual citizenship: Argentine and Dutch.

M<U+00E1>xima was also made Princess of the Netherlands some days before the wedding by Her Majesty [[Queen Beatrix]].

==Marriage==
[[Image:Beurs van Berlage Koninklijk Huwelijk.jpg|thumb|left|The [[civil marriage]] ceremony of Princess M<U+00E1>xima and [[Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange|Prince Willem-Alexander]] in the [[Beurs van Berlage]] in 2002]]
The couple announced their engagement on [[30 March]], [[2001]]. By addressing the nation in near fluent Dutch during the directly televised broadcast on the occasion of the engagement, she won the hearts of the Dutch public.

M<U+00E1>xima and Prince Willem-Alexander were married on [[2 February]] [[2002]] in a civil ceremony in the [[Beurs van Berlage]], [[Amsterdam]] which was then followed by a religious ceremony at the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]] (also in Amsterdam).  After her wedding, she became the most popular member of the Dutch royal family.

==Children==

The couple's first child was born [[December 7]], [[2003]], in [[The Hague]]. The baby girl, '''[[Princess Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands|Princess Catharina-Amalia Beatrix Carmen Victoria of the Netherlands]]''' addressed as ''Princess Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands'' or Amalia by her family, is second to the [[Line of succession to the Dutch Throne|line of succession to the Dutch throne]] and will be [[heir apparent]] upon Willem-Alexander becoming King, due to a change in Dutch succession law which gives equal inheritance rights to the eldest child of the monarch, regardless of gender. She was baptised on [[June 12]], [[2004]] at St. Jacob's, Church in [[The Hague]].

Their second daughter, '''[[Princess Alexia of the Netherlands|Princess Alexia Juliana Marcela Laurentien of the Netherlands]]''' addressed as ''Princess Alexia of the Netherlands'', was born on [[June 26]], [[2005]] in [[The Hague]]. She is third in the [[Line of succession to the Dutch Throne|line of succession to the Dutch throne]] and was baptised on [[November 19]], [[2005]] in Wassenaar.

On [[September 25]] [[2006]], it was announced that Princess M<U+00E1>xima was pregnant with a third child.<ref>{{nl icon}} [http://www.nos.nl/nosjournaal/artikelen/2006/9/25/250906_maxima_zwanger.html Prinses M<U+00E1>xima opnieuw zwanger]</ref> M<U+00E1>xima's busy schedule during her pregnancy was praised by the Dutch media. She visited Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Austria, Norway and Turkey in only 6 months, as well as keeping her schedule in the Netherlands. Considering the advanced state of her pregnancy, it was rumored that the couple took Dutch soil with them on their trips in case there was an emergency birth abroad, as a symbol of being born on Dutch soil. This was, however, denied by the couple.

On [[April 10]], [[2007]], Princess M<U+00E1>xima gave birth to the couple's third daughter, '''[[Princess Ariane of the Netherlands|Princess Ariane Wilhelmina M<U+00E1>xima Ines of the Netherlands]]''', addressed as ''Princess Ariane of the Netherlands''. She is fourth in the [[Line of succession to the Dutch Throne|line of succession to the Dutch throne]] and was baptised on [[October 20]], [[2007]] at the Abbey Church in The Hague.

The second names of all three of their daughters are after Dutch queens: Amalia's for her grandmother, [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]], Alexia's for her great-grandmother, [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Queen Juliana]] and Ariane's for her great-great-grandmother, [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]].

Princess M<U+00E1>xima is also godmother to two royal babies: '''[[Countess Leonore of Orange-Nassau, Jonkvrouwe van Amsberg|Countess Leonore]]''', daughter of ''[[Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands|Prince Constantijn]]'' and ''[[Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands]]'', and of '''[[Prince Sverre Magnus of Norway]]''', son of ''[[Crown Prince Haakon|Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway]]'' and ''[[Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway|Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway]]''.
