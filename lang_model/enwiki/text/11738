'''Miles Dewey Davis III''' ([[May 26]] [[1926]]  &ndash;  [[September 28]] [[1991]]) was one of the most influential and innovative [[musician]]s of the 20th century. A [[trumpet]]er, [[bandleader]] and [[composer]], Davis was at the forefront of almost every major development in [[jazz]] after [[World War II]]. He played on some of the important early [[bebop]] records and recorded the first [[cool jazz]] records.  He was partially responsible for the development of [[modal jazz]], and [[jazz fusion]] arose from his work with  other musicians in the late 1960s and early 1970s. [[Free jazz]] was the only post-war style not significantly influenced by Davis, although some musicians from his bands later pursued this style. His [[sound recording|recordings]], along with the live performances of his many influential bands, were vital in jazz's acceptance as music with lasting artistic value.  A popularizer as well as an innovator, Davis became famous for his languid, melodic style and his laconic, and at times confrontational, personality.  As an increasingly well-paid and [[fashion|fashionably-dressed]] jazz musician, Davis was also a symbol of jazz music's commercial potential.

Davis was late in a line of jazz trumpeters that started with [[Buddy Bolden]] and ran through [[Joe "King" Oliver]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Roy Eldridge]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]]. He has been compared to [[Duke Ellington]] as a musical innovator: both were skillful players on their instruments, but were not considered technical virtuosos.  Ellington's main strength was as a composer and leader of a large band, while Davis had a talent for drawing together talented musicians in small groups and allowing them space to develop.  Many of the major figures in post-war jazz played in one of Davis's groups at some point in their career.  

Davis was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on March 13, 2006. He has also been inducted into the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]], and the [[Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame]].

== Life ==
=== Early life (1926 to 1945) ===
Miles Davis was born into a relatively wealthy [[African-American]] family living in [[Alton, Illinois]].  His father, [[Miles Henry Davis]], was a [[dentistry|dentist]], and in 1927 the family moved to a white neighborhood in [[East St. Louis]]. They also owned a substantial ranch, and Davis learned to ride horses as a boy.

Davis's mother, Cleota, wanted Davis to learn the [[violin]]&mdash;she was a capable [[blues]] [[pianist]], but kept this hidden from her son, feeling that "negro" music was not sufficiently genteel.  At the age of nine, one of Davis's father's friends gave him his first [[trumpet]], but he did not start learning to play seriously until the age of thirteen, when his father gave him a new trumpet and arranged lessons with local trumpeter [[Elwood Buchanan]].  Against the fashion of the time, Buchanan stressed the importance of playing without [[vibrato]], and Davis would carry his clear signature tone throughout his career.

[[Clark Terry]] was another important early influence and friend of Davis's.  By the age of sixteen, Davis was a member of the musician's union and working professionally when not at [[high school]].  At seventeen, he spent a year playing in bandleader [[Eddie Randle]]'s "Blue Devils".  During this time, [[Sonny Stitt]] tried to persuade him to join the [[Tiny Bradshaw]] band then passing through town, but Cleota insisted that he finish his final year of high school.

In [[1944 in music|1944]], the [[Billy Eckstine]] band visited St. Louis.  [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Charlie Parker]] were members of the band, and Davis was taken on as third trumpet for a couple of weeks because of the illness of [[Buddy Anderson]].  When Eckstine's band left Davis behind to complete the tour, the trumpeter's parents were still keen for him to continue formal academic studies.

=== Bebop and the birth of the cool (1944 to 1955) ===
[[Image:Birth of the Cool.jpg|thumb|200px|left|CD reissue of Davis's [[1957 in music|1957]] LP ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'', collecting much of his 1949 to 1950 work.]]

In [[1944 in music|1944]] Davis moved to [[New York City]], ostensibly to take up a scholarship at the [[Juilliard School of Music]]. In reality, however, he neglected his studies and immediately set about tracking down [[Charlie Parker]]. His first recordings were made in 1945, and he was soon a member of Parker's quintet, appearing on many of Parker's seminal [[bebop]] recordings for the [[Savoy Records|Savoy]] and [[Dial Records|Dial]] labels.  Davis's style on trumpet was already distinctive by this point, but as a soloist he lacked the confidence and virtuosity of his mentors, and was known to play [[throttled note]]s (a trademark of Davis's) and to sometimes stumble during his solos. 
 	 
By [[1948 in music|1948]] he had served his apprenticeship as a sideman, both on stage and record, and a recording career of his own was beginning to blossom. Davis began to work with a [[nonet (music)|nonet]] that featured then-unusual instrumentation such as the [[Horn (instrument)|French horn]] and [[tuba]]. The nonet featured a young [[Gerry Mulligan]] and [[Lee Konitz]]. After some gigs at New York's Royal Roost, Davis was signed by [[Capitol Records]]. The nonet released several singles in 1949 and 1950, featuring arrangements by [[Gil Evans]], [[Gerry Mulligan]] and [[John Lewis (pianist)|John Lewis]]. This began his collaboration with Evans, with whom he would collaborate on many of his major works over the next twenty years. The sides saw only limited release until 1957, when eleven of the twelve were released as the album ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' (more recent issues collect all twelve sides).
	 
Between 1950 and 1955, Davis mainly recorded as a leader for [[Prestige Records|Prestige]] and [[Blue Note]] records in a variety of small group settings.  Sidemen included [[Sonny Rollins]], [[John Lewis (pianist)|John Lewis]], [[Kenny Clarke]], [[Jackie McLean]], [[Art Blakey]], [[Horace Silver]], [[Thelonious Monk]], [[J. J. Johnson]], [[Percy Heath]], [[Milt Jackson]] and [[Charles Mingus]].  Davis was influenced at around this time by pianist [[Ahmad Jamal]], whose sparse style contrasted with the "busy" sound of bebop.

Playing in the jazz clubs of New York, Davis was in frequent contact with users and dealers of [[Recreational drug use|drug]]s, and by [[1950 in music|1950]], in common with many of his contemporaries, he had developed a serious [[heroin]] addiction. For the first part of that decade, although he gigged a great deal and played many sessions, they were mostly uninspired, and it seemed that his talent was going to waste. No one was more aware of this than Davis himself, and his wife. In the winter of 1953-1954 he returned to East St. Louis and locked himself in a guest room in his father's farm for seven days until the drug was fully out of his system.

After overcoming his heroin addiction, Davis made a series of important recordings for Prestige in [[1954 in music|1954]], later collected on ''[[Bags' Groove]]'', ''[[Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants]]'' and ''[[Walkin']]''.  At this time he started to use the Harmon [[mute (music)|mute]] to darken and subdue the [[timbre]] of his trumpet, and this muted trumpet tone was to be associated with Davis for the rest of his career.

However, the 1954 recordings were not released immediately, and the recovery of his popularity with the jazz public and critics had to wait until July 1955, when he played a legendary solo on Monk's "[['Round Midnight (song)|'Round Midnight]]" at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]].  This performance thrust Davis back into the jazz spotlight, leading to George Avakian signing Davis to Columbia and the formation of his first quintet.

=== First quintet and sextet (1955 to 1958) ===
In [[1955 in music|1955]], Davis formed the first incarnation of the renowned Miles Davis Quintet.  This band featured [[John Coltrane]] ([[tenor saxophone]]), [[Red Garland]] ([[piano]]), [[Paul Chambers]] ([[double bass]]) and [[Philly Joe Jones]] ([[drums]]).  Musically, the band picked up where Davis's late 1940s sessions had left off.  Eschewing the rhythmic and harmonic complexity of the then-prevalent bebop, Davis was allowed the space to play long, [[legato]], and essentially [[melody|melodic]] lines in which he would begin to explore [[musical mode|modal music]].  Davis still admired Ahmad Jamal, and the quintet's music reflects his influence as well.

[[Image:Milestonescover.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Davis's [[1958 in music|1958]] album ''[[Milestones (album)|Milestones]]''.]]
The first recordings of this group were made for [[Columbia Records]] in 1955, released on ''[['Round About Midnight]]''.  Davis was still under contract to Prestige, but had an agreement that he could make recordings for subsequent releases using his new label.  His final recordings for Prestige were the product of two days of recording in 1956, released as ''[[Relaxin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'', ''[[Steamin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'', ''[[Workin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'' and ''[[Cookin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]''.

Though today it is often regarded as one of the greatest groups in jazz history, Davis's choice of sidemen received some criticism at the time. <!-- What criticism, specifically? --> Additionally, the quintet was never stable; several of the other members used heroin, and the Miles Davis Quintet disbanded in early [[1957 in music|1957]].

In 1958, the quintet reformed as a sextet, with the addition of [[Julian Cannonball Adderley|Julian "Cannonball" Adderley]] on [[alto saxophone]], and recorded ''[[Milestones (album)|Milestones]]''.  Musically, it encompasses both the past and the future of jazz.  Davis showed that he could play both [[blues]] and bebop (ably assisted by Coltrane), but the centerpiece is the title track, a Davis composition centred on the [[Musical mode|Dorian and Aeolian modes]] and featuring the free improvisatory modal style that Davis would make his own.  One of the tracks, "Billy Boy", features just the rhythm section, without horns&mdash;a very unusual feature in itself. Another unusual feature of the song "Billy Boy," if listened to closely, one can hear sobbing in the background for the duration of the song.

=== Recordings with Gil Evans (1957 to 1963) ===
[[Image:Sketches of Spain - Miles Davis.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Davis's [[1960 in music|1960]] album ''[[Sketches of Spain]]''.]]
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Davis recorded a series of albums with [[Gil Evans]], often playing [[flugelhorn]] as well as trumpet.  The first, ''[[Miles Ahead]]'' (1957), showcased his playing with a jazz [[big band]] and a horn section beautifully arranged by Evans.  Tunes included [[Dave Brubeck]]'s "The Duke", as well as [[L<U+00E9>o Delibes]]'s "The Maids Of Cadiz", the first piece of [[European classical music]] Davis had recorded.

In Davis and Evans's ''[[Porgy and Bess (Miles Davis album)|Porgy and Bess]]'', a 1958 arrangement of [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', the framework of the Gershwin songs provided ample space for Davis to improvise, showing his mastery of variations and expansions on the original themes, as well as his original melodic ideas.  Davis named the album one of his own favorites.

''[[Sketches of Spain]]'' (1959 to 1960) featured tunes by contemporary Spanish composer [[Joaquin Rodrigo]] and also [[Manuel de Falla]], as well as Gil Evans originals with a Spanish theme.  ''Miles Davis at Carnegie Hall'' ([[1961 in music|1961]]) includes Rodrigo's "Concierto de Aranjuez", along with other tunes recorded at a concert with an orchestra under Evans's direction.

Sessions in [[1962 in music|1962]] and [[1963 in music|1963]] resulted in the album ''[[Quiet Nights]]'', a short collection of [[bossa nova]] tunes which was released against the wishes of both Evans and Davis.  An unsuccessful session in [[1968 in music|1968]] was the last time the two men collaborated.

=== Kind of Blue (1959 to 1964) ===
After recording ''Milestones'', Garland and Jones were replaced by [[Bill Evans]] and [[Jimmy Cobb]].  Davis probably hired Evans for his harmonically sophisticated approach.  For various reasons, Evans's stay in the group was relatively brief, and he departed late in 1958, replaced by [[Wynton Kelly]].

In March and April 1959, Davis re-entered the studio with his working sextet and Bill Evans to record what is widely considered his masterpiece, ''[[Kind of Blue]]''.  The album was planned around Evans's piano style. It was also influenced by concepts that Evans had learned while working with [[George Russell]] on the earliest recordings of [[modal jazz]] and passed on to the sextet. Kelly only played on "Freddie Freeloader", and was not present at the April session.  [[So What (instrumental)|So What]] and [[All Blues]] had been played by the sextet at performances prior to the recording sessions, but for the other three compositions, Davis and Evans prepared skeletal harmonic frameworks which the other musicians saw for the first time on the day of recording, in order to generate a fresh and spontaneous [[improvisation]]al approach.  The resulting album is the best-loved and (according to the [[RIAA]]) best-selling jazz album ever, and also has proven to be a huge influence on other musicians.

The same year, while taking a break outside the famous [[Birdland]] night club in [[New York City]], Davis was beaten by the [[New York City Police Department|New York police]] and subsequently arrested. Believing the assault to have been racially motivated, he attempted to pursue the case in the courts, before eventually dropping the proceedings.  Such treatment was markedly at odds with his treatment outside the U.S., and especially on his regular European tours, where he was f<U+00EA>ted by society.

Coltrane, who had been eager to form his own group, was convinced by Davis to play with the group on one final European tour in the spring of 1960.  He then departed to form his classic quartet, although he returned for some of the tracks on the 1961 album ''[[Someday My Prince Will Come (album)|Someday My Prince Will Come]]''.  Davis tried various replacement saxophonists, including [[Sonny Stitt]] and [[Hank Mobley]].  The quintet with Hank Mobley was recorded in the studio and on several live engagements at [[Carnegie Hall]] and the [[Black Hawk (nightclub)|Black Hawk supper club]] in [[San Francisco]].  Stitt's playing with the group is found on the ''Live in Stockholm'' CD.

In 1963, Davis's long-time rhythm section of Kelly, Chambers and Cobb departed.  He quickly got to work putting together a new group, including [[tenor saxophone|tenor saxophonist]] [[George Coleman]] and bassist [[Ron Carter]].  Davis, Coleman, Carter and a few other musicians recorded half an album in the spring of 1963.  A few weeks later, drummer [[Tony Williams]] and pianist [[Herbie Hancock]] joined the group, and soon thereafter Davis, Coleman and the young rhythm section recorded the rest of the ''[[Seven Steps to Heaven (album)|Seven Steps to Heaven]]'' album.

The young rhythm section clicked very quickly with each other and the horns; the group's rapid evolution can be traced through the aforementioned studio album, ''[[In Europe (album)|In Europe]]'' (July 1963), ''[[My Funny Valentine (album)|My Funny Valentine]]'', and ''[[Four and More (album)|Four and More]]'' (both February [[1964 in music|1964]]).  The group played essentially the same repertoire of bebop and standards that earlier Davis bands did, but tackled them with increasing structural and rhythmic freedom and (in the case of the up-tempo material) breakneck speed.

Coleman left in the spring of 1964, to be replaced by [[avant-garde]] saxophonist [[Sam Rivers]], on the suggestion of Tony Williams.  Davis, however, who knew of Rivers's leanings toward [[free jazz]], a genre which Davis disdained, knew that Rivers was not the ideal replacement he was looking for.  Rivers remained in the group only briefly, but was recorded live with the quintet in Japan; the group can be heard on ''[[In Tokyo (album)|In Tokyo]]'' (July 1964).

By the end of the summer, Davis had managed to convince [[Wayne Shorter]] to quit [[Art Blakey]]'s Jazz Messengers, a reluctant decision because Shorter had become musical director of that group.  Shorter's arrival completed the trumpeter's Second Great Quintet.  Surely enough, Shorter became the principal composer of Miles's quintet, and some of his compositions of this era ("Footprints", "Nefertiti") are now standards.  While on tour in Europe, the group quickly made their first official recording, ''[[Miles in Berlin (album)|Miles in Berlin]]'' (Fall 1964).

=== Second quintet (1965 to 1968) ===
By the time of ''[[E.S.P. (album)|E.S.P.]]'' ([[1965 in music|1965]]) the lineup (Davis's second great quintet, and the last of his acoustic bands) consisted of [[Wayne Shorter]] (saxophone), [[Herbie Hancock]] (piano), [[Ron Carter]] (bass) and [[Tony Williams]] (drums). 

A two-night [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] gig by this band in late 1965 is captured on the 8-CD set ''[[The Complete Live at The Plugged Nickel 1965]]'' released in 1995.  Unlike the group's studio albums, the live engagement still shows the group playing primarily standards and bebop tunes, albeit with a greater degree of freedom than in previous years.

This was followed by a series of strong studio recordings: ''[[Miles Smiles (album)|Miles Smiles]]'' ([[1966 in music|1966]]), ''[[Sorcerer (album)|Sorcerer]]'' ([[1967 in music|1967]]), ''[[Nefertiti (album)|Nefertiti]]'' (1967), ''[[Miles in the Sky (album)|Miles in the Sky]]'' (1968) and ''[[Filles de Kilimanjaro]]'' (1968).  The quintet's approach to improvisation came to be known as "time no changes," because while they retained a steady pulse, they abandoned the [[chord progression|chord-change]]-based approach of bebop.  Through ''Nefertiti'', the studio recordings consisted of primarily originals composed by Wayne Shorter, and to a lesser degree the other sidemen.  In 1967, the group began the unusual practice of playing their live concerts in continuous sets, with each tune flowing into the next and only the melody indicating any sort of demarcation; Davis's bands would continue to perform in this way until his retirement in 1975.

''Miles in the Sky'' and ''Filles de Kilimanjaro'', on which [[electric bass]], [[electric piano]] and [[guitar]] were tentatively introduced on some tracks, clearly pointed the way to the subsequent [[jazz fusion|fusion]] phase in Davis's output.  Davis also began experimenting with more [[rock (music)|rock]]-oriented rhythms on these records, and by the time the second half of ''Filles de Kilimanjaro'' had been recorded, [[Dave Holland]] and [[Chick Corea]] had replaced Carter and Hancock in the working band, though both Carter and Hancock would contribute to future recording sessions.  Davis soon began to take over the compositional duties of his sidemen.
 
=== Electric Miles (1969 to 1975) ===
[[Image:Miles-davis-in-a-silent-way.jpg|frame|200px|left|Davis's first [[jazz fusion]] album, ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' ([[1969 in music|1969]]).]]

Recent boxed sets have shown that Davis's progression from the "free-bop" (or postbop) of the Second Quintet to the dense, rhythmic world of fusion was much less abrupt than it seemed initially, when ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' followed ''Filles de Kilimanjaro''.  Miles's influences, widely attributed to the tastes of his future wife [[Betty Davis|Betty Mabry]], were the late 1960s acid, funk and rock heroes, namely [[Sly and the Family Stone]], [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]]. Slightly later, most prominently on [[1972 in music|1972]]'s ''On the Corner'', the influence of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] became evident.  This transition required that Davis and his band adapt to modern, electric instruments in both live performances and the studio.

By the time ''In a Silent Way'' had been recorded in February 1969, Davis had augmented his standard quintet with additional players.  Hancock and [[Joe Zawinul]] were brought in to assist Corea on electric keyboards, and the young guitarist [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]] made the first of his many appearances with Miles at this time.  By this point, Wayne Shorter was also doubling on soprano saxophone.  After the recording of this album, [[Tony Williams]] left to form his group [[Lifetime]] and was replaced by [[Jack DeJohnette]].

Six months later, an even larger group of musicians, including [[Jack DeJohnette]], [[Airto Moreira]] and [[Bennie Maupin]], recorded ''[[Bitches Brew]]''.  These two records were the first truly successful amalgamations of jazz with [[rock (music)|rock music]], laying the groundwork for the genre that would become known simply as "[[Jazz-rock fusion|fusion]]".

Both ''Bitches Brew''  and ''In a Silent Way'' feature "extended" (more than 20 minutes each) compositions which were never actually "played straight through" by the musicians in the studio.   Instead, Miles and producer [[Teo Macero]] selected musical motifs of various lengths from recorded extended improvisations and edited them together into a musical whole which only exists in the recorded version.   ''Bitches Brew'', in particular, is a case study in the use of electronic effects, multi-tracking, tape loops and other editing techniques.

[[Image:Bitches brew.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''[[Bitches Brew]]'' ([[1970 in music|1970]]), Davis's first [[Gold album]].]]
During this period, Davis toured with the "Lost Quintet" of Shorter, Corea, Holland and DeJohnette.  Though Corea played electric piano and the group occasionally hinted at rock rhythms, the music was edgy, uncompromising post-bop that frequently spilled over into full-blown [[free jazz]].  The group's repertoire included material from ''Bitches Brew'', ''In a Silent Way'', the 1960s quintet albums, and an occasional standard.

Both records, especially ''Bitches Brew'', proved to be huge sellers for Davis, and he was accused of "selling out" by many of his former fans, while simultaneously attracting many new fans who listened to Davis alongside the more popular rock acts of the late 1960s.

Davis reached out to new audiences in other ways as well. Starting with ''Bitches Brew'', Davis's albums began to often feature art much more in line with [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] or [[black power]] movements than with his earlier albums' art. He took significant cuts in his usual performing fees in order to open for [[rock (music)|rock]] groups like the [[Steve Miller Band]], the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Carlos Santana|Santana]]. ([[Carlos Santana]] has stated that he should have opened concerts for Davis, rather than the other way around.) Several live albums were recorded during the early 1970s at such performances:  ''It's About That Time'' (March 1970; Shorter's last appearance with the group), ''Black Beauty'' (April 1970; [[Steve Grossman]] replacing Shorter on saxophones) and ''At Fillmore'' (June 1970; [[Keith Jarrett]] joining the group as a second keyboardist).  In contrast with the Lost Quintet, the music on these albums is [[funk]]ier and more [[rock (music)|rock]]-oriented, with relatively few free jazz tendencies.  Corea began to rely heavily on effects like [[ring modulation]], and Dave Holland shifted to the electric [[bass guitar|bass]] (having primarily played acoustic bass for the previous year).

By the time of ''Live-Evil'' (December 1970; Jarrett as the only keyboardist, [[Gary Bartz]] replacing Grossman on saxophones, and [[Michael Henderson]] replacing Holland on electric bass, [[Airto Moreira]] percussion.) Davis's ensemble had transformed into a much more funk-oriented group.  Davis began experimenting with [[wah-wah]] effects on his horn.  The ensemble with Bartz, Jarrett and Henderson, often referred to as the "Cellar Door band" (the live portions of ''Live-Evil'' were recorded at a club by that name), never recorded in the studio, but is documented in the six CD Box Set "The Cellar Door Sessions" which was recorded over four nights in December of 1970.

1970 saw Davis contribute extensively to the soundtrack of a documentary about the great African-American boxer [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]].  A devotee of [[boxing]], Davis drew parallels between Johnson, whose career had been defined by the fruitless search for a Great White Hope to dethrone him, and Davis's own career, in which he felt the establishment had prevented him from receiving the acclaim and rewards that were due him.  The resulting album, [[1971 in music|1971]]'s ''[[A Tribute to Jack Johnson]]'', contained two long pieces that utilised the talents of many musicians, some of whom were not credited on the record itself, including the guitarists [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]] and [[Sonny Sharrock]].  Working with producer [[Teo Macero]], Davis created what many critics regard as his finest electric, rock-influenced album, though its use of editing and studio technology would be fully appreciated only upon the release of the five-CD ''[[The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions]]'' in [[2003 in music|2003]].

Davis refused to be confined by the expectations of his traditional audience or music critics, and continued to explore the possibilities of his new band. As he stated in his autobiography, he wanted to make music for the young afro-american audience. ''[[On The Corner]]'' ([[1972 in music|1972]]) showed a seemingly effortless grasp of [[funk]] without sacrificing the rhythmic, melodic and harmonic nuance that had been present throughout his entire career. The album also showed the influences of [[Paul Buckmaster]]'s studio arrangements and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Stockhausen]] in its layered recording and post-production editing. This album was highlighted by the appearance of saxophonist [[Carlos Garnett]].This record provoked fierce disparagement from many critics, with one British critic noting: "I love Miles, but this is where I get off."
Miles Davis in his autobiography stated that this criticism was made because no critic could categorized this music and complained that ''[[On the Corner]]'' was promoted by the "traditional" jazz radio stations, therefore not to young afro-americans.  Miles himself thought that the record would be "something for black people to remember me by".

After recording ''On the Corner'', Davis put together a new band, with only [[Michael Henderson]], [[Carlos Garentt]] and percussionist [[Mtume]] returning from the Cellar Door band.  This band included guitarist [[Reggie Lucas]], tabla player [[Badal Roy]], sitarist [[Khalil Balakrishna]] and drummer [[Al Foster]].  The band was unusual in that none of the sidemen were major jazz instrumentalists; as a result, the group's music emphasized rhythmic density and shifting textures instead of individual solos.  This group, which recorded in the [[Philharmonic Hall]] for the album ''[[In Concert: Live at Philharmonic Hall|In Concert]]'' (1972), was unsatisfactory to Davis.  Through the first half of [[1973 in music|1973]], he dropped the tabla and sitar, took over keyboard duties, and added guitarist [[Pete Cosey]] to the group.  The Davis/Cosey/Lucas/Henderson/Mtume/Foster ensemble would remain virtually intact over the next two years.  Initially, [[Dave Liebman]] played saxophones and flute with the band; in [[1974 in music|1974]] he was replaced by [[Sonny Fortune]].

By the mid-1970s, Davis's previous rate of production was falling. ''[[Big Fun (album)|Big Fun]]'' (1974) was a double album containing four long jams, recorded between 1969 and 1972.  Similarly, ''[[Get Up With It]]'' ([[1975 in music|1975]]) collected recordings from the previous five years.  ''Get Up With It'' included "He Loved Him Madly",  a tribute to [[Duke Ellington]], as well as one of Davis's most lauded pieces from this era, "Calypso Frelimo". Contemporary critics complained that the album had too many underdeveloped ideas.  This was his last studio album of the seventies. 

In 1974 and 1975, Columbia recorded three double-LP live Davis albums: ''Dark Magus'', ''[[Agharta (album)|Agharta]]'' and ''[[Pangaea (album)|Pangaea]]''.  ''Dark Magus'' is a 1974 New York concert; the latter two are recordings of consecutive  concerts from the same February 1975 day in [[Osaka]], [[Japan]].  At the time, only ''Agharta'' was available in the US; ''Pangaea'' and ''Dark Magus'' were initially released only by CBS/Sony Japan.  All three feature at least two electric guitarists (Reggie Lucas and Pete Cosey, deploying an array of post-Jimi Hendrix electronic distortion devices; Dominique Gaumont is a third guitarist on ''Dark Magus''), electric bass (Davis still relying on the funk-tinged, stripped-down playing of Michael Henderson), drums, reeds, and Davis on trumpet (also electrified) and organ.  These albums, documenting the working bands Miles was leading at that point, were the last music he was to record for five years.  

Troubled by [[osteoarthritis]] (which led to a hip replacement operation in 1976, the first of several), [[bursitis]], [[rheumatism]] and a renewed dependence on illegal drugs, Davis withdrew almost completely from the public eye for five years.  As Gil Evans said, "His organism is tired.  And after all the music he's contributed for 35 years, he needs a rest."  

While in retirement, Davis saw the fusion music that he had spearheaded over the past decade firmly enter into the mainstream.  Whether played by Davis's many prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>s, including [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Chick Corea]] with his groundbreaking fusion group [[Return to Forever]], [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]'s [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], and the [[Weather Report]] (founders [[Wayne Shorter]] and [[Joe Zawinul]] both spent time in Davis's bands), Davis's influence could be heard everywhere, much as it could after each of his previous revolutionary advances.

Davis's 1970s recordings have in recent years undergone a fairly radical reassessment, and are now seen by many as a significant body of work comparable to that of his earlier periods, and as an extremely interesting mixture of ideas gleaned from jazz, funk and rock music, as well as from experimental, "process-oriented" European composers.  Recently, [[Dave Douglas]], [[Wadada Leo Smith]], [[Mark Isham]], [[Tim Hagans]], [[Nicholas Payton]] and others have recorded albums more or less indebted to Davis's electric era.

=== Last Decade (1981 to 1991) ===
As always, Davis assembled his bands from among the finest musicians available, including the saxophonist [[Bill Evans (saxophonist)|Bill Evans]] (no relation to the pianist) and a young bass player named [[Marcus Miller]] who would become one of Davis's most regular collaborators throughout the decade.  Davis's first new studio album, ''[[The Man With The Horn]]'' ([[1981 in music|1981]]), was relatively poorly received.  The same year, Davis prepared to tour again, and formed a touring band with largely different members from those who had played on the album.  In May, they played two dates as part of the [[Newport Jazz Festival]], and the concerts, as well as the live recording ''[[We Want Miles]]'' from the ensuing tour, were well reviewed.

By the time of ''[[Star People]]'' ([[1983 in music|1983]]), Davis's band included guitarist [[John Scofield]], with whom Davis worked closely on both ''Star People'' and [[1984 in music|1984]]'s ''[[Decoy (album)|Decoy]]'',  an underdeveloped, experimental mixture of [[soul music]] and [[electronica]].   Despite the uneven quality of much of his recorded output, live Davis was still capable of moments, and entire concerts, of great inspiration.  With a seven-piece band, including Scofield, Evans, drummer [[Al Foster]] and bassist [[Darryl Jones]] (later of [[The Rolling Stones]]), he played a series of European gigs to rapturous receptions.  While in Europe, he took part in the recording of ''[[Aura (Miles Davis album)|Aura]]'',  an orchestral tribute to Davis composed by the Danish trumpeter [[Palle Mikkelborg]].

Back in the studio, ''[[You're Under Arrest (album)|You're Under Arrest]]'' ([[1985 in music|1985]]) included another stylistic detour: interpretations of contemporary pop songs in [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s "Time After Time" and [[Michael Jackson]]'s "Human Nature",  for which he would receive much criticism in the jazz press, although the record was otherwise well-reviewed.  Davis also noted that many accepted [[jazz standard]]s were in fact [[pop music|pop songs]] from [[Broadway theatre]], and that he was simply selecting more recent examples of pop songs to perform. ''You're Under Arrest'' would also be Davis's final album for Columbia, due to the long-term deterioration of his relationship with the label; Columbia's strong promotion of [[Wynton Marsalis]] was a factor in Davis's departure from the label. A delay in the release of ''Aura'', possibly the most highly regarded album of his last decade, was also a factor.

Again demonstrating his eclecticism during this time period, Davis collaborated with a number of figures from the British [[New Wave music|new wave]] movement, including [[Scritti Politti]]. Davis &mdash; at the invitation of producer [[Bill Laswell]] &mdash; recorded some trumpet parts during sessions for [[Public Image Ltd.]]'s ''[[Album (album)|Album]]'' album, according to Public Image's [[John Lydon]] in the liner notes of their ''[[Plastic Box]]'' box set, although in Lydon's words, "strangely enough, we didn't use (his contributions)." (Also according to Lydon in the ''Plastic Box'' notes, Davis favorably compared Lydon's singing voice to his trumpet sound.)[http://www.fodderstompf.com/DISCOGRAPHY/LP/3albumLP.html]

Having first taken part in the [[Artists United Against Apartheid]] recording, Davis signed with [[Warner Brothers]] records and reunited with [[Marcus Miller]].  The resulting record, ''[[Tutu (album)|Tutu]]'' ([[1986 in music|1986]]), would be his first to feature  modern studio tools&mdash;programmed [[synthesizer]]s, [[sampling (music)|samples]] and drum loops&mdash;to create an entirely new setting for Davis's playing.  Ecstatically reviewed on its release, the album would frequently be described as a modern version of the classic ''Sketches of Spain'', and won a [[Grammy]] award in [[1987 in music|1987]].

He followed ''Tutu'' with the soundtracks to two movies, ''[[Street Smart]]'' and ''[[Siesta (album)|Siesta]]'', with neither the films nor Davis's scores being particularly noteworthy (other than [[Morgan Freeman]]'s celebrated turn as "Fast Black" in ''Street Smart''), but he continued to tour with a band of constantly rotating personnel and a critical stock at a level higher than it had been for fifteen years.

He was married to actress [[Cicely Tyson]] in 1981, and they were divorced in 1988.

Miles Davis continued to tour and perform regularly through the last years of his life. He died from a [[stroke]] in [[September 28]], [[1991]] at the age of 65. He is interred in the [[Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[The Bronx]], [[New York]].
