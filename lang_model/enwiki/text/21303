"'''Radio'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]] taken from her third studio album, ''[[I Am<U+2026> Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008). The [[up-tempo]] [[europop]] song was composed by Knowles, [[Rico Love]], Dwayne Nesmith and [[Jim Jonsin]]. "Radio" displays influences of '1980s [[synthpop]], [[europop]], [[Electro music|electro]], and [[techno]]. In the song, Knowles explores the relationship between a younger girl and her love for the songs played on the radio. 

"Radio" received positive reception from most music critics who praised Knowles' departure from her usual [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] style. Some critics even complimented the believability as well as the originality of the song and picked it out as a standout from both the standard and deluxe editions of the album. In September 2009, "Radio" was used to promote Dutch radio station '[[Radio 538]]', and it subsequently charted on the [[Dutch Top 40]] singles chart at number fourteen. It also peaked at number five on the Dutch Urban chart.

==Production and composition==

<blockquote>
It just seems like a feel-good record but when you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up. In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't do all the things that a lot of the other teenage girls did because I was so in love with my radio and my music. I was so in love with this radio and my parents were happy that I was into something positive.<ref>{{cite web|author=(Posted: 2008) |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/showbiz/2009-10/13/content_8788039_4.htm |title=Beijing date announced for Beyonce's "I AM..." world tour |work=[[China Daily]] |publisher=[[Communist Party of China]] |date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
The song received generally positive reviews from critics, many of whom mainly praised Knowles's brief departure from usual [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] style as well as praising the believability and originality of the song. Leah Greenblatt of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', who was not impressed at all with the song [[Diva (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles song)|Diva]], nevertheless praised "the spiky [and] [[Europop]] throb" of 'Radio' and further said that the song "expertly taunt[s] the boys and fill[s] the dance floor".<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Alexis Petridis of ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that the 19[[80s]] [[synthpop]] mode of "Radio" might be less suited to Knowles compared to the old [[Soul music|soul]] samples, that powered "[[Crazy in Love (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles song)|Crazy in Love]]" (2003) and "[[Suga Mama]]" (2007), because of the fact that her vocal style is similar to those of the 19[[60s]] visceral female singers. However, he ended up saying that there is no denying that "Radio" is an "irresistible [[Pop music|pop]] song."<ref name="guardian1"/> Colin McGuire of [[PopMatters]] highlighted Knowles's diversion from her usual [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] style, writing that "Radio" is a new, different and interesting act which takes Knowles "down a road much different than we have ever seen". He further said that the [[drum and bass]] and [[Techno music|techno]] as well as [[House music|house]] feel of the song is refreshing and might even suggest "a more expansive, experimental side of the songstress on her follow-up."<ref name="pop">McGuire, Colin.
