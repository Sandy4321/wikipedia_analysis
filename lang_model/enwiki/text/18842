'''''The Secret Garden''''' is a [[1993 in film|1993]] film adaptation of the 1909 [[The Secret Garden|novel of the same name]] by [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]. The film was directed by [[Agnieszka Holland]].

==Plot==
{{Cleanup-rewrite|2=section|date=May 2009}}
The recently-orphaned Mary Lennox travels from her home in [[India]] to her uncle Archibald Craven's hundred-room house, Misselthwaite Manor, in [[Yorkshire]], [[England]]. Mary, materially spoiled but emotionally neglected by her late parents, killed by an earthquake, is rather unpleasant and unhappy in her new surroundings. Martha, a Yorkshire girl working as a maid, and her brother Dickon Sowerby, a boy who can "talk" to animals, befriend and help her to heal and grow. She discovers her deceased aunt's secret garden, which has been locked for ten years and enlists Dickon to help her bring it to life.

Hidden away in the gloomy house is Mary's cousin Colin, who has been treated all his life like a fragile, sickly invalid. This exaggeration has augmented what smaller problems he did have, turning him into a demanding, short-tempered, helpless boy. Mary, defying the orders of Mrs Medlock (who runs Misselthwaite), discovers Colin and is taken aback by his constipation, but reaches out to him anyway. Soon Colin, Mary, and Dickon all spend their time in the secret garden. They perform "magic"; barefoot, they  make a large bonfire and play a flute, dance round it, and chant, while Colin asks the magic to send his father. Colin learns to walk and gets quite well, which his father Archibald discovers upon his return to Misselthwaite.
