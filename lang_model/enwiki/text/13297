'''Abdallah al-Battal''' ({{lang-ar|<U+0639><U+0628><U+062F><U+0627><U+0644><U+0644><U+0647> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0628><U+0637><U+0644>}}; "Abdallah the Hero", died in 740) was a Muslim warrior of the [[Arab<U+2013>Byzantine Wars]] of the early 8th century, participating in several of the campaigns launched by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] against the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Historical facts about his life are scarce, but an extensive pseudo-historical and legendary tradition grew around him after his death, and he became a famous figure in both Arab and later Turkish epic literature as '' [[Battal Gazi|Sayyid Battal Ghazi]]''.

== Biography ==
Nothing is known of Abdallah al-Battal's origin or early life. Much later accounts claim that he hailed from [[Antioch]] or [[Damascus]], and that he was a ''[[mawla]]'' of the [[Umayyad]] family. He is also given various ''[[kunya (Arabic)|kunya]]'', Abu Muhammad, Abu Yahya, or Abu 'l-Husayn.<ref name="EI2">Canard (1986), pp. 1002<U+2013>1003</ref> Even his name is not certain: [[Khalid Yahya Blankinship]] suggested that he might be the same person as a certain "'Amr" recorded by the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor]] in the Nicaea campaign of 727, and hence that "'Amr" could be his actual personal name or a [[patronymic]] (i.e. his name could be 'Amr ibn Abdallah or Abdallah ibn 'Amr), while alternatively "Abdallah" could simply be an honorific.<ref>Blankinship (1994), p. 314 (Note 20)</ref>

According to historical sources (the chroniclers [[al-Ya'qubi]] and [[al-Tabari]]), Abdallah first appears in 727, in one of the annual raids against Byzantine [[Asia Minor]]. This campaign was commanded by [[Muawiyah ibn Hisham]], the son of the reigning Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik|Hisham]] ([[reign]]ed 723<U+2013>743). Abdallah led the vanguard, with which he penetrated as far as the city of [[Gangra]] in [[Paphlagonia]], which he captured and razed, before the army went on to unsuccessfully [[Siege of Nicaea (727)|lay siege]] to [[Nicaea]].<ref name="EI2"/><ref>Blankinship (1994), p. 120</ref> Blankinship considers Abdallah's capture of Gangra ranks as one of the greatest successes of Umayyad arms against the Byzantines in this period, along with the capture of [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]] by [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik]] in 726.<ref>Blankinship (1994), pp. 120<U+2013>121</ref> Later accounts from the 10th century, however, place Abdallah al-Battal alongside Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik during the latter's [[Siege of Constantinople (717<U+2013>718)|failed siege]] of [[Constantinople]] in 717<U+2013>718. As the Arab accounts of the siege are semi-legendary, it is impossible to know if this report contains any truth.<ref name="EI2"/>

Abdallah himself commanded another raid in 731<U+2013>732, of which little is known. It most probably was a failure, and is remembered only for the death in battle of another Arab hero, Abd al-Wahhab ibn Bukht.<ref name="EI2"/><ref name="B162">Blankinship (1994), p. 162</ref> In the next year, [[Anno Hegirae|AH]] 115 (732<U+2013>733), Abdallah campaigned again alongside Muawiyah ibn Hisham, raiding as far as [[Akroinon]] in [[Phrygia]]. A Byzantine army under a certain Constantine tried to confront the Muslims, but Abdallah defeated Constantine and took him prisoner.<ref name="EI2"/><ref name="B162"/><ref name="PmbZ">Winkelmann, Lilie, et al. (1999), pp. 5<U+2013>6</ref> Abdallah's next and last appearance is in 740, when a major campaign involving several tens of thousands of men was launched by the Umayyads against Byzantium. Along with Malik ibn Shu'ayb, deputy governor of [[Malatya]], Abdallah commanded a 20,000-strong cavalry force while [[Sulayman ibn Hisham]] led the main force behind them. Abdallah and Malik's force reached as far as Akroinon, but there they were [[Battle of Akroinon|confronted and defeated]] by the Byzantines under Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] (r. 717<U+2013>741) in person. Both Arab generals and two thirds of their army perished.<ref name="EI2"/><ref name="PmbZ"/><ref>Blankinship (1994), pp. 169<U+2013>170</ref>

== Legend ==
If his military career was not particularly distinguished, Abdallah al-Battal quickly became the subject of popular tales and his fame grew, so that by the 10th century he was well established as one of the heroic figures of the [[Arab<U+2013>Byzantine Wars]]: [[al-Mas'udi]] (''[[The Meadows of Gold]]'', VIII, 74<U+2013>75) ranks him among the "illustrious Muslims" whose portraits were displayed in Byzantine churches.<ref name="EI2"/> In the 10th<U+2013>12th centuries his alleged role in the siege of Constantinople was embellished by the Persian historian [[Bal'ami]] and the [[al-Andalus|Andalusian]] mystic [[Ibn Arabi]].<ref name="EI2"/> A number of fictional anecdotes became part of the accepted historical corpus around Abdallah from the time of [[Ibn 'Asakir]] (1106<U+2013>1175) on: the use of his name to frighten children by the Byzantines; his entry into [[Amorion]] pretending to be a messenger and discovery of the Byzantine plans; his stay at a convent, whose abbess shielded him from Byzantine soldiers and whom he took with him and married; and finally his death in battle and burial, attended by Emperor Leo himself.<ref name="EI2"/>

Battal's exploits became the subject of two [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]], the Arabic-language "Tale of Delhemma and al-Battal" (''[[Delhemma|S<U+012B>rat <U+1E0E><U+0101>t al-Himma wa-l-Ba<U+1E6D><U+1E6D><U+0101>l]]'') and the Turkish epic tradition of ''[[Battal Gazi|Sayyid Ba<U+1E6D><U+1E6D><U+0101>l Gh<U+0101>z<U+012B>]]''.<ref name="EI2"/> Although both were composed in the 12th century and draw upon a common Arabic tradition, they show significant differences, with the Turkish tale including many uniquely Turkic and Persian elements, including supernatural elements from folk tradition or motifs from the ''[[Shahname]]'' and the ''Romance of [[Abu Muslim]]''.<ref name="Melikoff">Melikoff (1986), pp. 1003<U+2013>1004</ref> Both romances place al-Battal in the mid-9th century and associate him with the epic cycle of Malatya and its emir, [[Umar al-Aqta]] (died 863), with the result that he became particularly associated with the city of Malatya and its region.<ref name="Melikoff"/><ref>Dedes (1996), pp. 9<U+2013>14</ref> In the ''Delhemma'', his own role in the Umayyad wars with Byzantium is taken over by the [[Banu Kilab|Kilabite]] hero al-Sahsah. In these tales al-Battal is presented as an Islamic analogue to [[Ulysses]], to the extent that his name became a byword for cunning.<ref>Canard (1961), pp.  158<U+2013>173, esp. 167<U+2013>169</ref> The Turks adopted al-Battal following the [[Danishmendid]] conquest of Malatya in 1102, and he became prominent as a Turkish national hero and symbol of their conquest of Asia Minor. His stories (''Battalname'') were reworked throughout the [[Seljuk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] periods, and became the subject of a considerable body of folk tales.<ref name="Melikoff"/><ref>Dedes (1996), pp. 9<U+2013>16, 23<U+2013>25</ref> A cult developed around him as a saintly figure ("''[[sayyid]]''"), especially among the [[Alevi]] and [[Bektashi]] sects, and his supposed tomb at [[Seyitgazi]] became a major centre of pilgrimage until the early 20th century, drawing pilgrims from as far as Central Asia.<ref name="Melikoff"/><ref>Dedes (1996), pp. 16<U+2013>22</ref>
