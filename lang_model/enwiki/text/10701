'''Wellfleet''' is a [[New England town|town]] in [[Barnstable County, Massachusetts|Barnstable County]], [[Massachusetts]],  [[United States]].  Located halfway between the "tip" and "elbow" of [[Cape Cod]], Massachusetts, the town had a population of 2,749 at the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]], which swells nearly sixfold during the summer.{{fact|date=March 2008}}  Nearly half of the land area of Wellfleet is part of the [[Cape Cod National Seashore]] and a total of 70% of the town's land area is in some form of protection.  Wellfleet is famous for its eponymous [[oyster]]s, which are celebrated in the annual October [[Wellfleet OysterFest]].  The town has the second greatest concentration of art galleries on Cape Cod, right after [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]]. 

== History ==
Wellfleet was encountered by Europeans as early as 1606, when the French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] explored and named it "Port Aux Huitres" (Oyster Port) for the bountiful oyster population resident to the area. Originally settled in the 1650s by the Europeans as Billingsgate (after the famous [[Billingsgate Fish Market|fish market]] in East London),  Wellfleet was part of neighboring [[Eastham, Massachusetts|Eastham]] until 1763, achieving town status after nearly 30 years of petitioning.  The name "Wellfleet" is disputed; some argue that it comes from "Whale Fleet," after the burgeoning whaling industry in the town, while some say it comes from a brand of oyster popular in England at the time, in order to help sales.  

Wellfleet's oyster beds drove the early economy, as did whaling and other fishing endeavors.  The town was home to 30 whaling ships by the American Revolution. However, because of the decline of whaling and the [[mackerel]] catch in the late nineteenth century, the fleet declined, being completely free of [[schooner]]s by 1900.  The oyster fleet continues to this day, however, harvesting many other types of shellfish as well.

[[Guglielmo Marconi]] built America's first transatlantic radio transmitter station in Wellfleet in 1901.  The first radio telegraph transmssion from America to England was sent from his Wellfleet station on January 18, 1903, a ceremonial telegram from President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]].  Most of the Wellfleet transmitter site is gone, however, as three quarters of the land it originally encompassed has been eroded into the sea.

In 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy]] created the [[Cape Cod National Seashore]], which encompasses most of the Atlantic shoreline of Cape Cod.  In Wellfleet the territory circles the town, from Jeremy Point through the swamps and "islands" along the Herring River, and extending the length of the Atlantic shore of the town.  

Construction of the Chequesset Inn in the late 1800s lead to the development of Wellfleet's large tourist economy. Today, Wellfleet also has many galleries and retirement communities.<ref>

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of 35.4&nbsp;[[square mile]]s (91.6&nbsp;[[km<U+00B2>]]), of which, 19.8&nbsp;square miles (51.4&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of it is land and 15.5&nbsp;square miles (40.2&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of it (43.89%) is water.  Wellfleet is bordered by [[Truro, Massachusetts|Truro]] to the north, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east, [[Eastham, Massachusetts|Eastham]] to the south, and [[Cape Cod Bay]] to the west.  Wellfleet is approximately fourteen miles south of [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]], thirty-three miles (by road) northeast of [[Barnstable, Massachusetts|Barnstable]], forty-eight miles from the [[Sagamore Bridge]], and one hundred miles (by road) southeast of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]].  

The lands of Wellfleet wrap around Wellfleet Harbor, extending from the main portion of the Cape around the harbor to Jeremy Point.  At one time, Wellfleet Harbor included an island known as [[Billingsgate Island]], which sat at the harbors mouth, to the south of the point. Once a flourishing small community with a [[light house]], the island was destroyed by coastal [[erosion]] and now exists as a shoal that is exposed at low tide.  The Billingsgate shoals are split between Wellfleet and neighboring Eastham.  Several other inlets extend inland from the harbor, at the mouth of the Herring River (also called "The Gut"), Duck Creek, Blackfish Creek and "The Run," which leads to several brooks.  

In addition to the Seashore, Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary, run by Massachusetts Audubon, surrounds much of The Run, including part of Small Island (between The Run and Blackfish Creek).  Between the sanctuary, seashore and other small parks and beaches, seventy percent of the town's area is protected.

==Transportation==
[[U.S. Route 6]] passes from north to south through the town.  The town's commercial center lies west of the route, along the shores of the harbor.  The route was straightened in the mid-twentieth century, and some maps still consider the "old" Route 6 to be a portion of [[Route 6A (Massachusetts)|Route 6A]].  The town has no rail or air service.  The nearest municipal airports are in Chatham and Provincetown, both about eighteen miles from town; the nearest national and international service can be found at [[Logan International Airport]] in Boston.

There is currently limited bus transportation into Wellfleet from Logan airport and the Upper Cape on [[Plymouth & Brockton Street Railway Company]], the Cape's local commuter service.
