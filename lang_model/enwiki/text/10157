'''Brett Sperry''' is a [[video game designer]] and a founder of [[Westwood Studios]].

==Career==
Sperry co-founded Westwood Studios with [[Louis Castle]] in 1985, when both were in their early 20s.<ref>Steinhauer, Adam (September 19, 1996). "Fun and Games: Company capitalizes on creativity with computer animation", ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'', p. D1.</ref>

Sperry has been credited with the roles of design, production, support and box and content. In addition to his work at Westwood, he has been credited on games developed/produced by the following companies: [[Intelligent Games, Ltd.]], [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] and [[Looking Glass Studios]].

Before starting Westwood Studios, Sperry worked at Applied Computer Technology in Las Vegas with [[Peter Filiberti]] doing game conversions for [[Activision]], [[Imagic]] and others. One of his major works was the [[porting|port]] of ''[[Impossible Mission]]'' to the [[Apple II]].

The intro to the first [[Command & Conquer (series)|Command & Conquer]] game consists of an anonymous character flicking through several fictional television channels in quick succession. One of these channels is called "The $perry Financial Network." This is an in-joke at [[Westwood Studios]] which made it into the final game.
