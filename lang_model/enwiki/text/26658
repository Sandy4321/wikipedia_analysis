In his 18-year tenure, Sakic has won the [[Stanley Cup]] twice, various NHL trophies and has been voted into 13 [[NHL All-Star Game]]s.

In [[1986-87 WHL season|1986&ndash;87]], the Broncos relocated to [[Swift Current, Saskatchewan]], becoming the [[Swift Current Broncos]]. Joe, playing in his first full season, was named Rookie of the Year of the WHL.<ref>{{cite web |title =Rookie of the Year - Jim Piggott Memorial Trophy|url =http://www.whl.ca/records/awards.php?id=55|publisher =[[Western Hockey League|WHL]]|accessdate =2007-09-18}}</ref> He notched 60 goals and 73 assists for 133 points.

The Broncos were driving to a game against the [[Regina Pats]] and due to bad weather conditions, the driver lost control on a patch of black ice outside of Swift Current, and the bus crashed.

==NHL career==
===Quebec Nordiques===
Sakic was drafted 15th overall by the [[Quebec Nordiques]] in the [[1987 NHL Entry Draft]].<ref name="Recordbook"/> Rather than make the immediate jump, he told the Nordiques management he would prefer to spend the 1987&ndash;88 season in Swift Current to prepare for the NHL.<ref name="Legends of Hockey">{{Cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=11437|title=Joe Sakic Page|accessdate=2007-04-09|publisher=Legends of Hockey|year=2007|author=Legends of Hockey}}</ref> He made his NHL debut on [[October 6]], [[1988]] against the [[Hartford Whalers]] and scored an assist. His first NHL goal came two days later against goaltender [[Sean Burke]] of the [[New Jersey Devils]].<ref name="NHLPA Bio">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhlpa.com/WebStats/PlayerBiography.asp?ID=4934|title=NHLPA Player Bio|accessdate=2007-04-10|publisher=NHLPA|year=2007|author=National Hockey League Players Association|authorlink=National Hockey League Players Association}}</ref> During the season, he wore #88 because his preferred number, #19 was already taken by a teammate, [[Alain C<U+00F4>t<U+00E9> (1957)|Alain C<U+00F4>t<U+00E9>]].<ref name="Numbers">{{cite book  | last = Morrison | first = Scott | authorlink = Scott Morrison | title = Hockey Night in Canada By the Numbers: From 00 to 99 |publisher = Key Porter Books Ltd. | date = 2007  | location = Toronto  | pages = 232  |id = ISBN 978-1-552639-84-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title =1988-89 Quebec Nordiques|url =http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0000471989.html|publisher =The Internet Hockey Database|accessdate =2007-07-16}}</ref> He finished his rookie season with 62 points in 70 games.

In [[1989-90 NHL season|1989&ndash;90]], his second NHL season, Sakic was able to switch his number back to his familiar #19 (Alain C<U+00F4>t<U+00E9> had retired over the summer), and scored 102 points, which was ninth overall in the league. At the start of the next season, [[1990-91 NHL season|1990&ndash;91]], he was named [[Captain (hockey)|co-captain]] along with [[Steven Finn]] (Sakic was captain for home games, Finn for away games)<ref name="Steven Finn">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hockeydraftcentral.com/1984/84057.html|title=1984 NHL Entry Draft: Steven Finn|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=HockeyDraftCentral.com|year=2005|author=Hockey Draft Central}}</ref> and again passed the 100 point mark, improving to 109 points and sixth overall in the leauge, but would slip during [[1991-92 NHL season|1991&ndash;92]] to 94 points, partly as a result of missing eleven games. Early on in the season, Sakic showed some of his leadership qualities, even while [[Mike Hough]] was serving as captain, as he stood firm in the [[Eric Lindros]] holdout issue. With Lindros holding out against the Nordiques, who were one of the worst teams in league, Sakic commented, "We only want players here who have the passion to play the game. I'm tired of hearing that name. He's not here and there are a lot of others in this locker room who really care about the game."<ref name="GrowingUp"/> Lindros was traded a year later, ending the situation and bringing in a number of quality players, which vastly improved the Nordiques.<ref name="Lindros">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/futures/2006draft/lookback_91_053106.html|title=A look back: 1991|accessdate=2007-04-15|publisher=NHL.com|year=2006|author=Roarke, Shawn P.}}</ref> During their first four seasons with Joe Sakic, the Nordiques finished last place in the [[Northeast Division (NHL)|Northeast Division]] and last in the entire league for three straight years, from [[1988-89 NHL season|1989]] to [[1990-91 NHL season|1991]].<ref name="Recordbook"/>

Starting with the [[1992-93 NHL season|1992&ndash;93 NHL season]], Sakic became the sole captain of the franchise.<ref name="Recordbook"/> Under his leadership, the Nordiques made the playoffs for the first time in six years, and set a franchise record for wins and points in the process (since broken by the [[2000-01 NHL season|2001]] Colorado Avalanche team).<ref name="Recordbook"/> Sakic reached the 100 point plateau, the third time he did so in five years, by scoring 48 goals and 105 points in the regular season, and added another 6 points in the playoffs. His production went down slightly to 92 points in [[1993-94 NHL season|1993&ndash;94]] as the Nordiques failed to make the playoffs again. After missing part of the [[1994-95 NHL season|1994&ndash;95]] season due to the players being [[1994-95 NHL lockout|locked out]] by owners, Sakic was 8 points behind [[Jaromir Jagr]] for the scoring title with a fourth place finish, and helped the Nordiques win the division title, their first in six years.<ref name="Recordbook"/>

===Colorado Avalanche===
In June of 1995, the Quebec Nordiques announced that they had been sold and were leaving Quebec. At the start of the [[1995-96 NHL season|1995&ndash;96 NHL season]], the franchise moved to [[Denver, Colorado]] and was renamed the [[Colorado Avalanche]]. Sakic led the team to its first [[Stanley Cup]] championship, scoring 120 points in 82 regular season games and 34 points in 22 playoff games. He was awarded the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the Most Valuable Player of the 1996 NHL playoffs. During the run for the cup, Sakic again proved himself to be an effective team leader. Although he had missed the playoffs in five of his first seven years in the NHL, and lacked any postseason experience, he scored 18 goals, including six game-winners, and 34 points. He was one goal off from the record for goals in a playoff year, and his game-winning goals established a new record.<ref name="1997 NHL Yearbook">{{cite book | last = National Hockey League  | title = 1997 NHL Yearbook | year = 1996 | publisher = Worldsport Properties | location = Toronto | pages = 232}}</ref> 

In the [[1996-97 NHL season|1996&ndash;97]] season, Sakic only played in 65 games due to a lacerated calf,<ref name="Rocky Mountain News">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/nhl/article/0,2777,DRMN_23920_5301508,00.html|title=Sakic lets game, NHL do talking|accessdate=2007-04-10|publisher=Rocky Mountain News|year=2007|author=Sadowski, Rick}}</ref> yet still managed to score 74 points as the Avalanche earned their first [[President's Trophy]] and third straight division title.<ref name="NHLPA Bio">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhlpa.com/WebStats/PlayerBiography.asp?ID=4934|title=NHLPA Player Bio|accessdate=2007-04-10|publisher=NHLPA|year=2007|author=National Hockey League Players Association|authorlink=National Hockey League Players Association}}</ref> He had another great playoff season with 8 goals and 17 assists, and took the Avalanche all the way to the conference finals, where they eventually lost to the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in six games. As a free agent during the summer of 1997, Sakic signed a three year, $21 million [[offer sheet]] with the [[New York Rangers]] as an unrestricted free agent. Under the collective bargaining agreement at the time, the Avalanche had one week to match the Rangers' offer or let go of Sakic. Colorado would match the offer,<ref name="Legends of Hockey"/> which instigated a salary raise for many NHL players.<ref name="TSN about the CBA">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=99378&hubname=nhl|title=Three key contracts helped kill the CBA|accessdate=2007-04-09|publisher=TSN.ca|year=2004|author=Associated Press}}</ref> 

Injuries would again limit Sakic's playing time in the [[1997-98 NHL season|1997&ndash;98]] season. While playing in his first Olympics with Team Canada, Sakic hurt his knee and was forced to miss eighteen games with the Avalanche.<ref name="Avalanche Website"/> In the sixty-four games he did play in, he still scored 63 points, enough to earn him his seventh All-Star appearance.<ref name="NHLPA Bio"/> He finally rebounded from his injury problems in the [[1998-99 NHL season|1998&ndash;99]] season, finishing fifth in the league in scoring with 41 goals and 96 points in only 73 games. He led the Avalanche all the way to within one game of the Stanley Cup finals, where they lost to the eventual Stanley Cup winning Dallas Stars. After the season ended, Sakic was ranked number 94 on ''[[The Hockey News]]''' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.<ref name="100 Greatest Players">{{cite book | last = Dryden | first = Steve  | title = The Top 100 NHL Players Of All Time | year = 1997 | publisher = McClelland & Stewart Inc. | location = Toronto | pages = 160}}</ref>

During the [[1999-00 NHL season|1999&ndash;00]] season, Sakic reached several career milestones. Injuries limited him to only 60 games, but he still managed to lead the team in scoring with 81 points. On [[December 27]], [[1999]], against the [[St. Louis Blues (hockey)|St. Louis Blues]], Sakic earned an assist to become the 56th player in NHL history to reach 1,000 career points.<ref name="2001 NHL Yearbook"/> Later in the season, on [[March 23rd]], [[2000]], he scored a hat trick against the [[Phoenix Coyotes]], and became the 59th player to score 400 career goals.<ref name="2001 NHL Yearbook"/> It also gave him 1,049 points with the Quebec/Colorado franchise, passing [[Peter Stastny]] as the all-time leader on the team.<ref name="NHLPA Bio"/> Sakic eclipsed the 100 point mark again in [[2000-01 NHL season|2000&ndash;01]], finishing with 118 along with a career best 54 goals. He led the Avalanche to their second Stanley Cup championship, and won the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]], the [[Lady Byng Memorial Trophy]] and the [[Lester B. Pearson Award]]. After the Avalanche defeated the [[New Jersey Devils]] in the 2001 finals in seven games, Sakic received the cup first as the captain. But instead of hoisting it high, he passed it straight to [[Ray Bourque]], a player who had waited a record-breaking twenty-two seasons to win the Stanley Cup.<ref name="Pass">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=287897|title=A hockey tradition comes to the NFL|accessdate=2007-01-28|publisher=NHL.com|year=2007|author=Weiner, Evan}}</ref> The [[2001-02 NHL season|2001&ndash;02]] season saw Sakic lead the Avalanche in scoring again, finishing sixth in the league with seventy-nine points. On [[March 9]], [[2002]], he played in his 1,000th career game. The Avalanche once again reached the Western Conference Finals, but lost to the eventual Cup winning [[Detroit Red Wings]]. The following year Sakic appeared in only 58 games, and finished with just 58 points, the lowest total of his career.<ref name="NHLPA Bio"/> He rebounded the following year, finishing third in the league with 87 points. It also marked the first time since the [[1993-94 NHL season|1993&ndash;94]] season that his team did not win the division title, which was won by the [[Vancouver Canucks]].

Following the [[2004-05 NHL lockout|2004&ndash;05 NHL lockout]], the Avalanche were forced to lose many of their key players in order to stay below the salary cap.<ref name="Lockout">{{Cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2116068|title=Sakic, Blake to stay; Forsberg, Foote up in air|accessdate=2007-04-10|publisher=ESPN.com|year=2005|author=Associated Press}}</ref> Even with the loss of teammates [[Peter Forsberg]] and [[Adam Foote]], Sakic still helped the Avalanche get into the playoffs, where they eventually lost to the [[Anaheim Ducks]] in the conference semifinals.

Sakic had another strong season in the [[2006-07 NHL season|2006&ndash;07]].

Despite his efforts as well as a late season charge, Sakic and the Avalanche missed the playoffs for the first time in eleven years, finishing one point behind the eighth placed Calgary Flames.

In April 2007, Sakic signed on for a 19th NHL season with the Colorado Avalanche, signing a one-year deal for the [[2007-08 NHL season|2007&ndash;08]] season.<ref name="Sakic signs one-year deal with Avalanche">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=203493&hubname=|title=Sakic signs one-year deal with Avalanche|accessdate=2007-04-09|publisher=TSN.ca|year=2007|author=Canadian Press}}</ref> Sakic commented on the deal, saying "at this stage in my career, I prefer to do one-year deals as I evaluate my play year-to-year."<ref name="Sakic signs one-year deal with Avalanche"/> Upon signing Sakic to the deal, Avalanche General Manager [[Francois Giguere]] said, "Joe is the heart of this organization and his leadership and value to this team and especially our young players is unquestioned."<ref name="Sakic resigned">{{Cite web|url=http://ottsun.canoe.ca/Sports/Hockey/2007/04/10/3970991-sun.html|title=Sakic reaches deal to return to Avs|accessdate=2007-04-10|publisher=Ottawa Sun|year=2007|author=Associated Press}}</ref> On [[May 1]], the NHL announced that Sakic was named as one of the three finalists of the Lady Byng Trophy,<ref name="Byng Finalist">{{Cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/sports/ci_5796168|title=Sakic one of three Lady Byng finalists|accessdate=2007-05-13|publisher=The Denver Post|year=2007|author=Dater, Adrian}}</ref> but it was eventually awarded to [[Pavel Datsyuk]] of the Detroit Red Wings.

[[Image:Joe Sakic Team Canada.jpg|thumb|left|Sakic at the 2006 Olympics]]
Sakic has had an extensive international hockey career, having represented Canada at seven international competitions.<ref name="Canadian Gold"/> After being drafted by the Nordiques in 1987, he went on and helped Canada win the [[World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|1988 World Junior Championship]].<ref name="Legends of Hockey"/> His next tournament was the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|1991 World Championships]], where Canada won the silver medal and Sakic contributed eleven points in ten games.<ref name="Legends of Hockey"/> He tried out for the 1991 Canadian Canada Cup team, but was the first player to be cut, being cited for his weak leg strength.<ref name="Legends of Hockey"/> Sakic was bitter about the experience, feeling he wasn't given a good enough chance to prove himself, and called the whole experience "a complete waste of time."<ref name="Second Chance">{{cite news |title=Sakic's Second Chance|url=http://www.chl.ca/HockeyWorldCup/aug15_hkwc_sakic.html|author=Strachan, Al|publisher=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=[[1996-08-15]]|accessdate=2007-11-21}}</ref>

Sakic's first successful professional tournament was the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|1994 World Championships]], where Canada won its first gold medal in the tournament since 1961. Sakic's seven points in eight games were a crucial part of the team's success.<ref name="Legends of Hockey"/> During the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]], he played only a minor role in Canada's second place finish as he scored one goal and two assists in six games.<ref name="1996WCH">{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/HockeyWorldCup/stats.html|title=1996 World Cup of Hockey Statistics|accessdate=2007-04-09|publisher=Canoe - Slam Sports!|year=1996|author=Canadian Press}}</ref> However the tournament allowed him to showcase that he was indeed a dominant player who had simply been overlooked.<ref name="HockeyWinner">{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/HockeyWorldCup/sep16_wctucker.html|title=HOCKEY THE BIG WINNER|accessdate=2007-04-09|publisher=Canoe - Slam Sports!|year=1996|author=Tucker, Larry}}</ref>

Sakic's first Olympic appearance came in [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998]] at [[Nagano]], [[Japan]] after the event allowed NHL players to compete for the first time. Bothered by a knee injury, he only scored three points in four games,<ref name="Avalanche Website"/> as the Canadian squad failed to meet expectations and finished in fourth. Sakic's second Olympic appearance came in the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. Led by his strong play, the Canadian team dominated all the way to the gold medal match against Team USA, where Sakic had four points and helped the team win its first gold medal in 50 years. He was later named MVP of the tournament with a cumulative tally of four goals and six assists. Sakic also played a part in Canada's triumph in the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]], where he scored six points in six games.<ref name="Legends of Hockey"/>

On [[December 21]], [[2005]], Sakic was named captain of [[Canadian national men's hockey team|Team Canada]] for the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], [[Italy]].<ref name="USA Today">{{cite news |title=Canada's deep Olympic roster is minus Crosby|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/torino/hockey/2005-12-21-canada-roster_x.htm|author=Brehm, Mike|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=[[2005-12-21]]|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref> Once again, Team Canada was heavily favored and given high expectations, but they failed to medal, finishing seventh overall.<ref name="New York Times">{{cite news |title=2006 Olympic Winter Games -- HOckey: Men; Canada Is Left With Questions and Speculation|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E2DF1F3EF937A15751C0A9609C8B63|author=Westhead, Rick|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=[[2006-02-24]]|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref> Sakic finished the tournament with three points.

==Personal life==
Sakic and his wife Debbie have three children: Mitchell and twins Chase and Kamryn.<ref name="Avalanche Website"/> They met at a local high school while he was playing in Swift Current, and they frequently return to the town during the off-season.<ref name="Denial of Death"/> Sakic is an avid golfer, and competed in the celebrity Pro Am golf tournament in [[Lake Tahoe]] in the Summer of 2006. Each Summer, he also hosts his own charity golf tournament which benefits the Colorado Food Bank.<ref name="Avalanche Website"/> His charity work, which is estimated to have provided more than 7 million meals to poor children and families, has earned an NHL Foundation Player Award in [[2007]].<ref>{{cite news |title =Sakic receives NHL Foundation Player Award for outstanding community service|url =http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?articleid=340142&page=NewsPage&service=page|publisher =[[NHL]]|date =[[2007-10-15]]|accessdate =2007-10-19}}</ref>

Alongside [[Bobby Clarke]], [[Wayne Gretzky]], and [[Mark Messier]], Sakic is one of four players to captain his team to a Stanley Cup championship and win the Hart Memorial Trophy in the same year. <ref name="Trophy Winner">{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/NHLAwards/010615_awards1-sun.html|title=Sakic is no ordinary Joe|accessdate=2007-05-14|publisher=NBCSports.com|year=2001|author=Zeisberger, Mike}}</ref> Sakic is also one of nineteen members in the [[Triple Gold Club]], a term used in ice hockey to describe players who have won an Olympic Gold medal, a World Championship Gold medal and the Stanley Cup. <ref name="Triple Gold">{{Cite web|url=http://live82.ihwc.net/english/article/news/index.ihwc?&artId=2646|title=IIHF announces NHL-European Victoria Cup|accessdate=2007-05-13|publisher=IHWC.net|year=2007|author=IHWC.NET staff}}</ref>

===Records===
In his 18-year career with the Nordiques and Avalanche, Sakic has obtained nearly all of the franchise scoring records, including most all-time goals (610), assists (979), and points (1579). He also holds the franchise record for most games played (1,319),<ref name="Recordbook"/> and is on several notable NHL record lists:

===Leadership===
Throughout his career, Sakic has been one of the top scorers in the league, but was widely criticized for not leading his team to any playoff success.<ref name="100 Greatest Players"/> While in Quebec, the Nordiques were one of the worst teams in the league, finishing last in their division five out of the seven years Sakic was with the team, including three straight years of being last overall in the league.<ref name="Recordbook"/> After leading the Avalanche to the Stanley Cup in 1996 with his 34 points, Sakic began to be seen as a leader capable of winning, and he was seen as one of the league's premier players.<ref name="Recognition">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chl.ca/HockeyWorldCup/sep5_sakic.html|title=Sakic gets what's coming to him|accessdate=2007-11-25|publisher=Canadian Hockey League|year=1996|author=Canadian Press}}</ref>

Though Sakic is a quiet individual, he is able to motivate his team to play at higher levels, which has earned him the respect of his peers and executives.<ref name="Captain">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/06/09/stanleyfinal010609.html|title=Captains Sakic, Stevens are consummate hockey leaders|accessdate=2007-11-26|publisher=CBC|year=2001|author=Stevens, Neil}}</ref> The first signs of Sakic's leadership began to show while still a member of the Swift Current Broncos of the WHL. After the bus crash that killed four of his teammates, Sakic was seen as the leader of the team, acknowledging that the experiance changed his outlook on life. This was further proven during the summer of 1997 when the New York Rangers offered him a large contract, in order to replace captain [[Mark Messier]] (who had left the team for the Vancouver Canucks), which under the rules of the NHL, the Avalanche were able to match.<ref name="TSN about the CBA"/>

One of the most defining actions of Sakic's career was at the conclusion of the 2001 playoffs. Defying the NHL tradition of the captain being the first to skate around with the Stanley Cup, Sakic passed it off to teammate [[Ray Bourque]].<ref name="Bourque">{{cite news |title =Avalanche beat Devils to capture Stanley Cup|url =http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/cup01/games/2001-06-09-njcol.htm|author =Allen, Kevin|publisher =[[USA Today]]|date =[[2001-06-10]]|accessdate =2007-11-26}}</ref> Bourque, one of the best defencemen to ever play, had been traded to the Avalanche the year before after spending 21 years with the [[Boston Bruins]] and setting the record for most games played without winning the Cup.<ref name="Bourque Wins">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=290833|title=For Bourque, at long last Stanley!|accessdate=2007-11-26|publisher=NHL.com|year=2007|author=Roarke, Shawn P.}}</ref> Sakic's handing of the trophy to Bourque is seen as just another example of Sakic's leadership abilities and how he perfoms through actions rather than words.<ref name="Captain"/>
