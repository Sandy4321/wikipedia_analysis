'''Theodore Stark "Ping" Wilkinson''' (December 22, 1888 &ndash; February 21, 1946) was a Vice-Admiral of the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. He also received the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions in [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz, Mexico]].

==Early life and career==
[[File:Theodore S Wilkinson Jr USNA.jpg|thumb|left|Wilkinson as a midshipman at the United States Naval Academy]]
Wilkinson entered the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1905 and graduated first in the class of 1909. He served the two years of sea duty then required by law prior to commissioning, in the [[battleship]]s [[USS Kansas (BB-21)|''Kansas'']] (BB-21) and [[USS South Carolina (BB-26)|''South Carolina'']] (BB-26), before he received his ensign's commission on June 5, 1911. After instruction at [[George Washington University]], [[Washington, D.C.]], under the auspices of the Navy's [[Bureau of Ordnance]] (BuOrd), Wilkinson reported to the battleship [[USS Florida (BB-30)|''Florida'']] (BB-30) on July 25, 1913 for sea duty. During his time in that [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|dreadnought]], Ens. Wilkinson led ''Florida'''s 2d Company in action during the landings on 21 and April 22, 1914 at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz, Mexico]]. For his skillful and courageous leadership of that unit of the battleship's landing force and his exhibition of "eminent and conspicuous" conduct, he received the [[Medal of Honor]].

==World War I and interwar years==
On August 4, he was transferred to the [[armored cruiser]] [[USS Tennessee (ACR-10)|''Tennessee'']] (ACR-10) and two days later sailed eastward in her across the [[Atlantic]]. ''Tennessee'' and [[USS North Carolina (ACR-12)|''North Carolina'']] (ACR-12) were ordered to [[Europe]]an waters to evacuate Americans trapped on the continent by the outbreak of [[World War I]]. On September 3, he became an assistant to the naval attach<U+00E9> at [[Paris]] and a month later left that post to join ''North Carolina'' in the [[Mediterranean]]. Subsequently, the young officer had tours of sea duty: first as aide, to Commander, 2d Division, [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]], and then as aide to the commander of the 7th Division.

From July 1916 to July 1919, Wilkinson served with distinction as the head of the Experimental Section, [[Bureau of Ordnance]], where he developed ordnance materials and devices, most notable being a noxious gas filler for shells and an "exceptionally satisfactory [[smoke screen]]". Additionally, he was deemed largely responsible for the successful design of a [[depth charge]] and for the development of the firing mechanism of the [[Mark VI mine]] used in the [[North Sea Mine Barrage]].

Following that tour ashore&mdash;for which he received a letter of commendation&mdash;Wilkinson went to sea, first serving as gunnery officer in the battleship ''Kansas'' and later as fire control officer in [[USS Pennsylvania (BB-38)|''Pennsylvania'']] (BB-38). In 1921 and 1922, Wilkinson commanded, in succession, the [[destroyer]]s [[USS Osborne (DD-295)|''Osborne'']] (DD-295), [[USS Goff (DD-247)|''Goff'']] (DD-247), and [[USS Taylor (DD-94)|''Taylor'']] (DD-94), before he returned to BuOrd's experimental section.

After commanding the destroyer [[USS King (DD-242)|''King'']] (DD-242) from January 1925 to December 1926, Wilkinson headed the Records Section of the [[Bureau of Navigation (United States Navy)|Bureau of Navigation]] (BuNav) Officer Personnel Division. In June 1930, he became fleet gunnery officer and aide to Commander, Scouting Fleet (later, Commander, Scouting Force), Rear Admiral [[A. L. Willard]]. Detached from that duty in December 1931, he soon assumed the duties of secretary to the Navy's General Board. While in that assignment, Wilkinson had additional duty during the arms limitation talks at [[Geneva]] in 1933 and in [[London]] in 1934.

From September 1934 to June 1936, Wilkinson served as executive officer of [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|''Indianapolis'']] (CA-35). Over the next three years, he headed the Planning Division of BuNav and then returned to ''Indianapolis'', this time in a staff capacity, as Chief of Staff to Commander, Scouting Force. In January 1941, he fleeted up to command the battleship [[USS Mississippi (BB-41)|''Mississippi'']] (BB-41).

==World War II==
[[File:NGAlliedCC.jpg|thumb|Wilkinson, second from left, with Brigadier General [[Leonard F. Wing]], Rear Admiral [[Richmond K. Turner]], and Major General [[John H. Hester]] aboard Turner's flagship during the [[New Georgia Campaign]].]]
Detached from that duty in September 1941 and promoted to flag rank, Wilkinson&mdash;as a rear admiral&mdash;became the director of the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] (ONI), in October, a post in which he worked for the next 10 months. This put him in a key position in the run up to Pearl Harbor, and his performance as [[ONI]]'s chief has been the subject of much controversy.  

It is known that Wilkinson was outmaneuvered by [[Richmond K. Turner]]:
{{Cquote|The reflections of nearly 20 years that had passed since Rear Admiral Turner had dominated [the Office of] War Plans and looked down his nose at the Office Naval Intelligence, and most of its minions, had not changed the man's conviction that the 1941 division of responsibilities within the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations for advising the Chief of Naval Operations (and preparing papers or despatches for dissemination) in regard to the over-all international situation which might involve the United States in war, and thus bring War Plans into effect, was properly a duty of the Director War Plans rather than the duty of the Director of Naval Intelligence.}}  http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ACTC/actc-5.html  [The source is Turner's biography by George Dyer].

But further, from this same source:
{{Cquote|Rear Admiral Wilkinson, right up until December 7, 1941, did not think the Japanese would attack any United States Territory. On December 6, 1941 he had informed Turner that Turner was "mistaken in the belief that Japan would attack a United States objective."}}

Subsequently reporting for duty as Commander, Battleship Division 2, [[U.S. Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]], in August 1942, Wilkinson eventually became Deputy Commander, [[South Pacific Area]] and South Pacific Force on January 30, 1943 and acted in that capacity until July 1944, when he assumed command of the 3d Amphibious Force, South Pacific.

In that billet, Wilkinson earned the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal|Distinguished Service Medal]] (DSM), for commanding the forces that supported the [[Battle of New Georgia|assaults on New Georgia]], [[Land Battle of Vella Lavella|Vella Lavella]] and the [[Battle of Treasury Islands|Treasury Islands]]; and established a "highly important" position on the west coast of [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]]. Subsequently redesignated as Commander, 3d Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet, with the rank of vice admiral, on August 12, 1944, Wilkinson won a gold star in lieu of a second DSM for his leadership in the assaults that [[Battle of Peleliu|took Peleliu]] and [[Battle of Angaur|then Angaur]], in the [[Palaus]]; and [[Ulithi]], in the [[Carolines]].

Subsequently, Wilkinson earned another gold star in lieu of a third DSM, for commanding Task Force 79 (TF 79) in action in the [[Philippines]] between October 1, 1944 and January 18, 1945&mdash;operations that included the landings conducted by the Southern Attack Force [[Battle of Leyte|on Leyte]] in October 1944 and [[Battle of Luzon|at Lingayen]] in January 1945.

Ordered to the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Department]] in September 1945 for temporary duty, Vice Admiral Wilkinson became a member of the Joint Strategic Survey Committee of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in January 1946. He was serving in that capacity when he lost his life on February 21, 1946 in an automobile accident at [[Norfolk, Virginia]].

He is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] and his grave can be found in section 2, Lot 3645.
