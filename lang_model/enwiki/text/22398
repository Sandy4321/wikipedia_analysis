''Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary'', Harvard University Press 2005.

They relocated to [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]], Texas, where they performed wherever they could: at street corners, weddings, ''[[quincea<U+00F1>era]]s'', and fairs. {{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=53}} As Selena grew more popular as a musical performer, the demands of her performance and travel schedule began to interfere with her education. Her father pulled her out of school altogether when she was in eighth grade.{{sfn|Mitchell|1995|p=}} Eventually, at seventeen, she earned a high school diploma by correspondence. {{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=59}}

The band<U+2019>s efforts at spreading their names and talents paid off in 1985 when the fourteen-year-old Selena recorded her first album for a local record company. The album was not sold in stores and her father bought all of the original copies. {{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=49}} It was rereleased in 1995 under the title ''[[Mis Primeras Grabaciones]]''. {{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=288}} Over the next three years, while not having a recording contract, she released six more albums. 

==Success==
At the 1987 [[Tejano Music Awards]], Selena won Best Female Vocalist, an award she would dominate for the rest of her life.{{sfn|Mitchell|1995|p=}}<ref name="TejanoAward">[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/16/earlyshow/leisure/music/main525834.shtml "Fans, Family Remember Selena"].

In 1988, she met [[Chris P<U+00E9>rez]], who had his own band. Two years later, the Quintanilla family hired him to play in Selena's band and they quickly fell in love. At first her father opposed their relationship and went as far as firing P<U+00E9>rez from the band. He eventually came to accept the relationship.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=}} On April 2, 1992, Selena and P<U+00E9>rez were married in [[Nueces County, Texas]].{{sfn|''New York Times''|1995|p=}}

In 1990 the album, ''[[Ven Conmigo]]'' was released, written by her brother and main songwriter [[Abraham Quintanilla III]]. This recording was the first Tejano album recorded by a female artist to achieve gold status. Around the same time, a registered nurse and fan named [[Yolanda Sald<U+00ED>var]] approached Selena's father with the idea of starting a fan club. Her wish was granted and she became the club's president; later she became the manager of Selena's retail enterprises.{{sfn|''New York Times''|1995|p=}} In 1992, Selena<U+2019>s stardom got a big boost with the song, "[[Como La Flor (song)|Como La Flor]]" off a new album, ''[[Entre a Mi Mundo]]''.

Meanwhile, her duet with the Barrio Boyzz, "[[Donde Quiera Que Est<U+00E9>s]]", reached number one in the [[Hot Latin Songs|Billboard Latin Charts]]. This prompted Selena to tour in Latin America. {{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=123}} She performed a duet with [[El Salvador|Salvadoran]] singer [[<U+00C1>lvaro Torres]], "[[Buenos Amigos]]".
