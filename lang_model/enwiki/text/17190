The [[2007]]<U+2013>[[2008]] '''Ethiopian crackdown in Ogaden''' (called also '''''Ethiopia<U+2019>s Dirty War''''' by several media<ref name =newsweek/><ref name = Porteous>Porteous, Tom."[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/08/05/ethiop16594.htm Ethiopia's dirty war]," ''[[Guardian Unlimited]]'' (re-published by [[Human Rights Watch]]), August 05, 2007.</ref>) was a campaign involving the [[Ethiopian Army]] on the offensive against the rebel [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]] (ONLF). The crackdown against the guerrillas began after they [[Abole raid|killed 74 people in an attack]] on a Chinese-run oil exploration field in [[April 2007]].

The main military operations were centered around the towns of [[Degehabur]], [[Kebri Dahar]], [[Wardheer]] and [[Shilavo]] in [[Ogaden]], which are in the [[Ethiopia]]n [[Somali Region]]. The area is home to the [[Ogaden (clan)|Ogaden clan]], seen as the bedrock of support to the ONLF.<ref name = AlertNet>[http://www.alertnet.org/db/crisisprofiles/ET_OGA.htm?v=in_detail Ethiopia Ogaden crisis], [[Reuters]] AlertNet, 1st December, 2007.</ref>

According to [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW), various human rights abuses were perpetrated by the Ethiopian military. Hundreds of civilians were killed and tens of thousands were displaced in 2007 alone, though exact figures are unknown because the area is remote and Ethiopian officials restrict access for humanitarian groups and journalists.<ref>Sanders, Edmund.

== Background ==
=== Insurgency ===
{{main|Insurgency in Ogaden}}
Ethiopia's eastern Somali Region, known as Region 5, whose eastern part constitutes the Ogaden, is the site of a long-running, low-intensity armed conflict between the Ethiopian government and the ONLF.<ref name = HRW47/>

Formed in [[1984]], many of the ONLF's members had supported [[Somalia]] in a [[Ogaden War|failed war]] with Ethiopia over the region in the 1970s. The group's aims have varied over time from independence to joining a "[[greater Somalia]]" or getting greater autonomy within Ethiopia.<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/674C444B-B772-4A5D-982E-384399CC8010.htm Unrest simmers in Ethiopia's Ogaden], ''AlJazeera'', April 15, 2008.</ref>

The ONLF fought against the military dictatorship of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]], but was not allied to the [[Tigrayan People's Liberation Front]] (TPLF), the rebel movement led by Ethiopia's current prime minister, [[Meles Zenawi]]. In [[1992]], after the [[Ethiopian Civil War]], the ONLF won control of the government of Ethiopia's newly formed Somali region. However, the ONLF's open advocacy of secession for Somali region and its frosty relations with the ruling party led to its ouster from government in [[1994]].<ref name = HRW47/>
 
The ONLF then reverted to waging armed attacks against the Ethiopian government, which has continued in the intervening years. For more than a decade, a heavy Ethiopian military presence in the region has been accompanied by widespread reports of human rights abuses committed by both sides. Those reports have generally been difficult to confirm because of the Ethiopian military's effective closure of the region to independent research and reporting.<ref name = HRW47/>

{{main|Abole raid}}
On [[April 24]], [[2007]], members of the ONLF [[Abole raid|attacked a Chinese-run oil field]] in [[Abole]], [[Somali Region]], killing approximately 65 Ethiopians and 9 Chinese nationals.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ethiopian Rebels Kill 70 at Chinese-Run Oil Field|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=[[2007-04-24]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/24/world/africa/24cnd-ethiopia.html?hp|accessdate=2007-04-24}}</ref> The ONLF claimed it had "completely destroyed" the oilfield. Most of the Ethiopians killed in the attack were daily laborers, guards and other support staff. Some members of the Ethiopian security officials were also killed during the surprise attack. It was the most deadly single attack by the  ONLF.<ref>[http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Africa_22/Ethiopia.shtml ONLF massacre detailed]</ref> On [[April 27]], Ethiopian government spokesperson reported that ONLF rebels had detonated a "grenade," killing one person who was attending a funeral of family member killed during the prior attack.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/04/27/africa/AF-GEN-Ethiopia-Explosion.php "Ethiopian rebels attack family mourning victim of earlier rebel assault,"], ''[[Associated Press]]'', [[April 27]], [[2007]]</ref>

On [[May 28]], ONLF fighters allegedly targeted two large gatherings in [[Jigjiga]] and Degahabur with [[hand grenade]]s. The blasts, and the crowd stampedes that followed, killed 17 people and wounded dozens, including the regional president of Somali region. Most of those who died in these two simultaneous attacks were civilians, including a 17 year-old school boy and a number of women. The ONLF denied responsibility for the attacks, but Human Rights Watch says the organization has in the past targeted civilian officials and clan leaders who refuse to support the insurgency.<ref name = HRW47>[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/07/02/ethiop16327.htm Ethiopia: Crackdown in East Punishes Civilians], [[Human Rights Watch]], July 4, 2007.</ref>

== Timeline ==
In June, the Ethiopian military swooped in and vowed "to hunt down" the rebels. They began this effort by closing all roads into the region to commercial and humanitarian traffic.<ref>Connors, Will. "[http://www.slate.com/id/2173264 Why we don't hear about the conflict in the Ogaden]," ''Slate Magazine'', Sept. 5, 2007.</ref>

On [[June 18]], in Labiga village, south of the town of Degehabur, Ethiopian forces allegedly killed 21 villagers who resisted when Ethiopian forces tried to take their livestock.<ref name = HRW47/>

[[Image:Somali land 2007 05 18.png|left|thumb|Areas of fighting shown in dark red]]
The ONLF announced a ceasefire on [[September 2]] while a U.N. mission was due to assess their claims of human rights abuses. "Effective immediately, armed forces of the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) will cease all offensive military operations against regime troops and sponsored militias for the duration of the U.N. fact finding mission," the ONLF said.<ref>"[http://www.eitb24.com/new/en/B24_64332/world-news/OGADEN-REGION-Ethiopian-rebels-announce-ceasefire-to-let/ Ethiopian rebels announce ceasefire to let U.N. mission work]," ''[http://www.eitb24.com/ eitb24.com]'', September 2, 2007.</ref>

On [[October 21]], 2007 an ONLF statement said its forces had killed 250 soldiers during the battle near the town of Wardheer. There was no confirmation of the attack either from the Ethiopian government or from independent sources.<ref>"[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22633366-5005961,00.html Rebels claim 250 troops killed]," ''[[Herald Sun]]'', October 23, 2007.</ref> On [[November 4]], the ONLF claimed that up to 270 Ethiopian soldiers had been killed in clashes between [[October 26]] and [[November 1]].

On [[February 26]] [[2008]], rebels said they killed 43 soldiers during two weeks of battles in the northern Ogaden region, but the government said there had not even been fighting in the area. "The bulk of the fighting has taken place in northern Ogaden in and around Nogob province," the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) said in a statement.<ref>"[http://shabelle.net/english/view_contents.php?articleid=1441 Ethio-Som troops come under blasts in Mogadishu]," ''Shabelle Media Network'', May 12, 2008.</ref><ref>"[http://www.onlf.org/onlfpres_feb262008.htm Military Communiqu<U+00E9>]," ''[[Ogaden National Liberation Front]]'', February 26, 2008.</ref>

== Human rights abuses ==
=== Ethiopian military brutality ===
[[Image:Somali region and towns.PNG|thumb|right|300px|[[Ethiopia]]n [[Somali region]] and major flashpoints]]
Ethiopia's military campaign has triggered a serious [[humanitarian crisis]]. The Ogaden National Liberation Movement accuses the government of blockading the region deliberately in order to produce a "man-made [[famine]]".<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6913363.stm Ethiopia deadline for Red Cross]," ''[[BBC News]]'', July 24, 2007.</ref>

Civilians in Somali region are trapped between the warring parties. [[Human Rights Watch]] learned that dozens of civilians have been killed in what appears to be a deliberate effort to mete out collective punishment against a civilian population suspected of sympathizing with the rebels.<ref name = Porteous/>

The Ethiopian military attacks on villages have displaced civilians in the [[Werder Zone|Werder]], [[Korahe Zone|Korahe]] and [[Degehabur Zone]]s, even in areas where there is no known ONLF presence. Ethiopian troops were destroying villages and property, confiscating livestock and forcing civilians to relocate. Whatever the military strategy behind them, according to the HRW these abuses violate the laws of war.<ref name = HRW47/>

Refugees fleeing the crackdown told stories of widespread violence, with entire villages being destroyed along with arbitrary theft, rape and murder by Ethiopian soldiers.<ref>[http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Africa_22/Ethiopia_starves_kills_own_people_its_refugees_say.shtml Ethiopia starves, kills own people, its refugees say]," ''[http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/index.shtml GaroweOnline]'', September 15, 2007.</ref> In October 2007, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that the situation in Ogaden had begun to mirror the [[Darfur conflict]], with refugees stating that government troops had burned villages and raped and killed civilians.<ref name="independent2007-10-17">{{cite web|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/article3067244.ece|title=Ethiopia's 'own Darfur' as villagers flee government-backed violence|accessdate=2007-10-23|last=Bloomfield|first=Steve|date=2007-10-17|format=HTML|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent News and Media Ltd|language=English|quote=[Refugees'] stories reveal the brutality of Ethiopia's hidden war, a brutal counter-insurgency that some aid officials believe has parallels with Darfur.}}</ref> Earlier in the month, Human Rights Watch had told the [[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health]] that "the Ogaden is not Darfur.

Human Rights Watch says it has documented dozens of cases of severe abuse by Ethiopian troops in the Ogaden, including gang rapes, burned villages and what it calls "demonstration killings," like hanging and beheading of populace, meant to terrorize the population.<ref name=NYT/>

=== Forceful draft of civilians ===
Several Ethiopian refugees and international organizations reported in [[December 2007]] that the Ethiopian military, strained by its deployment in Somalia, was forcing local civilians (including government employees and health workers) to fight alongside troops against the ONLF rebels. According to the same reports, these under-equipped and poorly trained militias suffered heavy casualties in several battles. One Western aid official said soldiers barged into hospitals to [[Conscription|draft]] recruits and threatened to jail health workers if they did not comply. In other cases, lists of names were posted on public bulletin boards, ordering government employees to report for duty, according to a current member of the regional parliament and two Ethiopian administrators who have fled the country. Many of those who refused were fired, jailed and in some cases tortured, the administrators and parliament member said.<ref name=IHT>Gettleman, Jeffrey. "[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/12/14/africa/ethiopia.php Civilians are forced to fight Ethiopian rebels]," ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', December 14, 2007.</ref>

Ethiopian officials denied the charges, claiming that local tribes were willingly forming defense groups against the ONLF. Several United Nations officials and Western diplomats said they were discussing the militia program in private meetings, but contended they could not comment publicly for fear of provoking the ire of the Ethiopian government, resulting in a possible suspension of humanitarian efforts in the region.<ref name=IHT/>

== Expulsions of humanitarian agencies ==
Large parts of the region were inaccessible to outside agencies as Ethiopian troops attempted to suppress the rebel insurgency.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6975126.stm#map Ethiopia rebels 'agree UN truce'], ''[[BBC News]]'', September 2, 2007.</ref>

In [[July 2007]], the [[Red Cross]] was given seven days to leave the Ogaden region by the Ethiopian government. The [[ICRC]] has been carrying out water and sanitation projects there.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6913363.stm Ethiopia deadline for Red Cross], ''[[BBC News]]'', July 24, 2007.</ref> International aid agency [[Medecins Sans Frontiers]] accused Ethiopia of denying it access to the  Ogaden region on [[September 1]], 2007.<ref>Plaut, Martin. "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6973816.stm Ethiopia 'blocking MSF in Ogaden']," ''[[BBC News]]'', September 1 2007.</ref>

On [[November 6]], the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) announced it is opening an aid facility in the Ogaden region. The U.N. has also called for an independent investigation into allegations of human rights abuses by Ethiopian forces in the region. Government troops are fighting Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) rebels who want more autonomy for their region.<ref name="reuters2007-11-06">{{cite news|first=Barry|last=Malone|title=UN to open office in Ethiopia's troubled Ogaden|url=http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL06251906.html|format=HTML|work=Africa.reuters.com|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=2007-11-06|accessdate=2007-11-06|language=English}}</ref> Medecins Sans Frontiers is among the 12 organizations that have received permission to work in Ogaden, while the ICRC is still barred from working in the region.<ref name="reuters2007-11-06" />

== Controversy involving Qatar ==
In the beginning of [[April 2008]], the [[Qatar]]-based [[Al-Jazeera]] news network aired a series of reports on the Ogaden region. Ethiopia severed diplomatic relations with the Gulf state on [[April 21]], 2008.<ref name=AFPQatar/>

In its statement, the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said it was because of "Qatar's attempts to destabilise the sub-region and its hostility towards Ethiopia itself". It accused Qatar of being blinded by arrogance and remaining deaf to all Ethiopia's attempts to persuade it to change its ways. Foreign Ministry sources reported that the Ethiopian government believes Qatar was giving substantial sums of money - amounting to circa $150,000 a month - to [[Eritrea]], which then go on to fund the Ogaden National Liberation Front.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7359470.stm Ethiopia severs ties with Qatar]. [[BBC News]], Monday, 21 April 2008.</ref>

In response, the official Qatari QNA news agency cited a foreign ministry spokesman as saying [[Doha]] was "surprised" by Addis Ababa<U+2019>s "unfounded and untruthful allegations," and saw them as "a deliberate attempt to justify its own erroneous policies."<ref>"[http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article26862 Qatar surprised at rift with Ethiopia]," ''Sudan Tribune'', April 24, 2008.</ref> The ONLF also criticized the Ethiopian move. "If there has been a destabilising factor in the Horn of Africa, it has been the regime currently in power in Ethiopia," the Ogaden National Liberation Front said in a statement. "The Ethiopian regime's severing of diplomatic relations with Qatar is based on accusations which are far from reality and designed to divert attention from yet another unfolding African genocide in Ogaden."<ref name=AFPQatar>"[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jHqWNIsWwFw-Q2EIgHlze2FvjeSQ Rebels criticise Ethiopia for breaking ties with Qatar], ''AFP'', April 21, 2008.</ref>

== Links to the war in Somalia and Eritrea's support to the rebels ==
The current campaign in the Somali region is also linked to Ethiopian [[War in Somalia (2006-present)|military operations in Somalia]]. One motive for Ethiopia's ouster of the [[Union of Islamic Courts]] (UIC) in [[December 2006]] may have been to cut the links between the ONLF, the ruling Islamic Courts and [[Eritrea]], including arms and logistical supply lines from Eritrea and Somalia to the ONLF in Ethiopia's eastern region.<ref name = HRW47/>

Experts say the ONLF was active in the Somali capital [[Mogadishu]] in [[2006]] when it was controlled by [[Islamic Courts Union]] and that some Islamist fighters may have fled to Ogaden after they were [[Fall of Mogadishu|ousted from Mogadishu]].<ref name = AlertNet/>

Ethiopia accuses neighboring Eritrea of using the ONLF to start a [[proxy war]] to destroy Ethiopia's economy. The two nations have been bitter enemies since they fought an unresolved [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War|border war]] in [[1998]]-[[2000]]. Officials in [[Asmara]] deny that Eritrea is aiding the ONLF. They accuse Ethiopia of using Eritrea as a scapegoat for its inability to settle disputes with Ethiopia's numerous ethnic groups.<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-04/2007-04-25-voa28.cfm?CFID=296863370&CFTOKEN=61579114 VOA - Ethiopian Rebel Group Denies Support From Eritrea]</ref>
