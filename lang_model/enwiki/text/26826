'''Nine Mile Canyon''' is a [[canyon]], approximately {{convert|40|mi|-1}} long, located in the  [[County (United States)|counties]] of [[Carbon County, Utah|Carbon]] and [[Duchesne County, Utah|Duchesne]] in eastern [[Utah]], in the [[Western United States]]. Promoted as "the world<U+2019>s longest art gallery," the canyon is known for its extensive [[rock art]], most of it created by the [[Fremont culture]] and the [[Ute tribe|Ute]] people. The rock art, shelters, and [[granary|granaries]] left behind by the Fremont make Nine Mile Canyon a destination for [[archaeology|archaeologists]] and tourists alike.

The canyon became a main [[transport corridor]] in the region during the 1880s. Settlers established a number of [[ranch]]es in Nine Mile, and even a short-lived town named [[Harper, Utah|Harper]]. No longer heavily traveled, the rugged canyon road was used mostly for recreation and tourism through the end of the 20th century. The discovery of rich deposits of [[natural gas]] deep beneath the Tavaputs Plateau has brought an influx of industrial truck traffic since 2002. The large amounts of fugitive dust produced by the trucks' passage may be damaging the rock art. Public debate is ongoing about how best to balance energy development in the canyon against the preservation of its cultural resources.

==Geography==
[[Image:NineMileCanyon map.png|thumb|300px|Map of Nine Mile, from [[National Scenic Byway]]s Program]]
Nine Mile Canyon runs roughly southwest to northeast, with numerous winding turns, just to the north of the [[Book Cliffs]], and south and east of [[Ashley National Forest]]. The full {{convert|78|mi|adj=on}} canyon route, through Gate Canyon, connects the towns of [[Wellington, Utah|Wellington]] and [[Myton, Utah|Myton]]. Nine Mile Creek, the [[stream]] that formed the canyon, is by no means a major body of water. Its importance lies in the fact that it is one of the few water sources in the region that are reliable year-round, and it has been so since prehistoric times. A number of [[tributary]] canyons branch off Nine Mile itself, including Argyle Canyon, Cottonwood Canyon, [[Minnie Maud]], and Dry Canyon. Significant rock art sites are frequently located near the junctions where they meet the main canyon.

It has been conservatively estimated that there are at least 1,000 rock art sites in the canyon, containing a total of more than 10,000 individual images.<ref name=spangler>{{cite book | last = Spangler | first = Jerry D. | coauthors = Spangler, Donna K. | title = Horned Snakes and Axle Grease: A Roadside Guide to the Archaeology, History and Rock Art of Nine Mile Canyon | publisher = Uinta Publishing | date = November 2003 | location = [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] | isbn = 0-9746090-0-5 }}</ref>{{rp|141}} The true figures may be ten times as high,<ref name=dirtraker>{{cite journal | last = Kloor | first = Keith | year = 2007 | month = September&ndash;October | title = Dirtraker | journal = [[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]] | publisher = [[Archaeological Institute of America]] | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = pp.40&ndash;45 | issn = 0003-8113 }} ([http://www.archaeology.org/0709/abstracts/dirtraker.html Abstract])</ref> but there is no question that rock art is more concentrated here than anywhere else in [[North America]]. The majority is in the form of pecked [[petroglyph]]s, and there are many painted [[pictograph]]s as well. Researchers have also identified hundreds of ancient [[pit-house]]s, rock shelters, and [[granary|granaries]], although only a limited amount of actual [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] has been carried out to date. Many of these structures are located high above the canyon floor on cliff ledges, pinnacles, and [[mesa]]s. They were built by the Fremont, whose presence in Nine Mile has been dated at AD 950&ndash;1250. Indeed, Nine Mile Canyon was one of the locations most heavily occupied by the Fremont.<ref>{{cite book | last = Watt | first = Ronald G. | title = A History of Carbon County | series = Utah Centennial County History Series | year = 1997 | month = January | publisher = Utah State Historical Society | location = Salt Lake City | pages = 14&ndash;16 | isbn = 0-913738-15-8 }}</ref> In contrast to the purely [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures that surrounded them, the Fremont practiced [[agriculture]], growing [[maize|corn]] and [[squash (plant)|squash]] along the canyon bottom. Unlike some Fremont areas, little [[pottery]] is found in Nine Mile, suggesting that [[bean]]s, which must be boiled for hours to become edible, were not an important part of the local diet.<ref name=spangler />{{rp|45}} The Fremont left [[irrigation]] ditches and earthen lodges on the valley floor that could be seen as late as the 1930s, but are no longer visible after generations of modern cultivation.<ref name=spangler />{{rp|21}}
[[Image:Utebison.jpeg|thumb|The prints under this [[bison]]'s hooves indicate Ute origin.]]
By the 16th century the ancestral Utes were in the canyon. They added to the rock art already on the walls, but in styles of their own. For example, many scenes depict Ute hunters on horseback, which date to the 1800s. Despite the impressive quantity of Ute [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] found in Nine Mile, there is no archaeological evidence of any Ute camps or residences.<ref name=spangler />{{rp|55&ndash;57}}

===Archaeological sites===
In 2009, 63 archaeological sites in the canyon were listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Most are named in the National Register listing only by their archaeological site codes. The sites in Carbon County are: 42Cb31, 42Cb33, 42Cb36, 42Cb46, 42Cb48, 42Cb50, 42Cb51, 42Cb52, 42Cb145, 42Cb242, 42Cb690, 42Cb697, 42Cb729, 42Cb730, 42Cb731, 42Cb736, 42Cb743, 42Cb744, 42Cb745, 42Cb746, 42Cb804, 42Cb809, 42Cb811, 42Cb851, 42Cb893, 42Cb969, 42Cb974, 42Cb1252, 42Cb1758, 42Cb2024, 42Cb2043, 42Cb2218, 42Dc706, Cottonwood Village, Drop-Dead Ruin, and First Canyon Site. Those in Duchesne County are: 42Dc306, 42Dc638, 42Dc682, 42Dc683, 42Dc684, 42Dc685, 42Dc686, 42Dc687, 42Dc688, 42Dc696, 42Dc700, 42Dc702, 42Dc703, 42Dc704, 42Dc705, 42Dc708, 42Dc709, 42Dc710, 42Dc712, Centennial House, Fool's Pinnacle, Karen's Cist, Maxies Pad, Nordell's Fort, Redman Village, Sunstone Village, and Taylor's City.

==History==
[[Image:Pregnantbuffalo.jpeg|thumb|left|Rock art from [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] to modern]]
There is some evidence that American [[fur trapper]]s may have entered the canyon in the early 19th century, but the first unequivocal sign of a white presence is an inscription on the canyon wall reading "S. Groesbeck August 19, 1867".<ref name=spangler />{{rp|62}} [[John Wesley Powell]]'s second [[Colorado River]] expedition camped at the mouth of the canyon in 1871, and the earliest appearance of the name ''Nine Mile Canyon'' is in records of the expedition.<ref name=spangler />{{rp|15}}

Nine Mile Road was constructed through the canyon in 1886 by the [[Buffalo Soldiers]] of the [[U.S. 9th Cavalry Regiment]], linking [[Fort Duchesne]] to the railroad through the city of [[Price, Utah|Price]]. Use of the road surged in 1889 after the discovery of [[Gilsonite]] in the [[Uinta Basin]]. This was the main transportation route in eastern Utah until well into the 20th century. Most of the [[stagecoach]], mail, freight, and [[telegraph]] traffic into the Uinta Basin passed through Nine Mile until after the arrival of the [[Uintah Railway]] around 1905.

The freight trade led to the settlement of the canyon itself. One of the main stagecoach stops developed into a town of sorts. Called [[Harper, Utah|Harper]], it included a hotel, store, school, and an unofficial post office. It lacked a formal town site, simply taking in a long stretch of scattered ranches and buildings. The community grew gradually from the 1880s until it was officially established as the town of Harper in 1905. The Harper precinct as a whole had a population of 130 at its peak in 1910,<ref name=duchesne>{{cite book | last = Barton | first = John D. | title = A History of Duchesne County | series = Utah Centennial County History Series | year = 1998 | month = January | publisher = Utah State Historical Society | location = Salt Lake City | isbn = 0-913738-41-7 }}</ref>{{rp|81&ndash;82}} but in the early 1920s Harper became a [[ghost town]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Carr | first = Stephen L. | title = The Historical Guide to Utah Ghost Towns | edition = 3rd | origyear = originally published June 1972 | year = 1986 | publisher = Western Epics | location = Salt Lake City, Utah | page = 168 | isbn = 0-914740-30-X }}</ref>

==Current issues==
[[Image:Defacedelk.jpeg|thumb|The conflict between private property and rock art]]
Rock art and other ancient artifacts are now protected by law, and although enforcement is difficult, outright [[looting]] and malicious [[vandalism]] are largely a thing of the past. Nine Mile Canyon's rock art is still at risk, however. Carved and painted mainly on weathered [[sandstone]] panels, the images are susceptible to [[erosion]], which is accelerated by touching<ref name=spangler />{{rp|87}} and by airborne dust. The dust is a special concern as heavy industrial traffic in the canyon increases.

Nine Mile Road, once such an important route, is almost completely [[pavement (material)|unpaved]]. In fact, it is considered the poorest of the four old military roads in Duchesne County.<ref name=duchesne />{{rp|71}} Difficult to travel as it is, the U.S. [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) designated it as a Scenic Backcountry Byway in 1990.<ref name=risk>{{cite news | last = Henetz | first = Patty | title = Nine Mile Canyon at risk | work = [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] | date = February 16, 2008 }}</ref> But the road itself no longer limits travel in the canyon as it once did. The rapid proliferation of [[off-road vehicle]]s has brought new access to the canyon's attractions&mdash;and new threats to their survival.<ref name=dirtraker />

===Natural gas development===
[[Image:Nine Mile Canyon Compressor Station.jpeg|thumb|left|Bill Barrett Corporation's natural gas compressor station, at the Dry Canyon junction]]
Nine Mile's unique archaeological resources have led to intense debate over [[land use]]. As in many rural areas of the Western United States, land in the canyon is a patchwork of [[public land|public]] and private property. Archaeological sites are found on both. Commercially important deposits of [[mineral]]s and other geological resources have also been discovered, further complicating the issues. Since 2002, the [[Bill Barrett Corporation]], in cooperation with the BLM and private landowners, has been pursuing a natural gas exploration project on the West Tavaputs Plateau in and around the canyon. The company estimates the available natural gas reserves at approximately 1 trillion cubic feet (2.8{{e|10}} m<U+00B3>).<ref name=risk/> Bill Barrett Corporation has spent some $2 million on improving area roads, and the complete project, if approved as planned, could create as many as 1000 jobs.<ref name=oversight>{{cite news | last = Thalman | first = James | title = Canyon oversight questioned | work = [[Deseret News]] | date = June 2, 2008 | page = B01 | url = http://deseretnews.com/article/content/mobile/1,5620,700231011,00.html?printView=true | accessdate = August 2, 2008}}</ref> Government involvement in the project has been controversial, drawing complaints from [[conservation movement|conservation]] groups that not enough is being done to protect natural and cultural resources.<ref>{{cite news | last = Barringer | first = Felicity | title = When the Bush Energy Policy Confronts Ancient Art | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = June 13, 2004 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E4D91330F930A25755C0A9629C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all | accessdate = November 23, 2007}}</ref>

The unprecedented levels of industrial truck traffic on Nine Mile's main road are producing troublesome clouds of dust. The poorly maintained dirt road was not built to handle so much traffic, and it is torn up within a few passes by heavy trucks.<ref name=risk/> The dust reduces visibility on the road, but it also settles on the rock art, obscuring it from view. Carbon County, which supervises the use of the road, has approved the application of [[magnesium chloride]] on the road as a [[dust abatement]] measure. The compound pulls moisture from the air to dampen dust, but it may be doing more harm than good.<ref name=dust>{{cite journal | last = Kloor | first = Keith | date = January 25, 2008 | title = Dust Storm Rising Over Threat to Famed Rock Art in Utah | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | publisher = [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] | volume = 319 | page = 394 | issn = 0036-8075 | url = http://ninemilecanyoncoalition.org/ninemilestudy.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = July 25, 2008}}</ref> Once the dust dries, the magnesium chloride drifts with it onto the rock walls and sticks there. It can crack the rock when it freezes in cold weather.<ref name=risk/> According to a 2007 study commissioned by the BLM and paid for by Bill Barrett Corporation,<ref name=oversight/> the magnesium chloride will corrode the rock panels over time, further accelerating the rock art's loss. Trying to clean the dust off the rock may damage it even more.<ref name=dust/>

In 2004, due to concerns about energy development and increasing recreational and tourist traffic, Nine Mile Canyon was named on the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]'s list of [[America's Most Endangered Places]].<ref>{{cite web | title =  Nine Mile Canyon | date = 2004 | url = http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/mountains-plains-region/nine-mile-canyon.html | work = America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places | publisher = National Trust for Historic Preservation | accessdate = May 8, 2009 }}</ref> In 2009, 63 sites in the canyon were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]],<ref name=nrhp /> and the BLM has announced plans to nominate some 800 more in years to come.<ref name=nom />
