===Washington Redskins===
[[file:Carlos rogers 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Rogers played for the [[Washington Redskins]] from 2005 to 2010, his first six seasons in the NFL.]]
Rogers was [[NFL Draft|drafted]] by the [[Washington Redskins]] with the ninth overall pick in the first round of the [[2005 NFL Draft]].  The Redskins then acquired a second first-round pick from the [[Denver Broncos]] in exchange for Washington's third-round pick in 2005, as well as their first pick in 2006 and a fourth round pick in 2006.  They used this second first-round pick to draft Rogers' Auburn teammate, [[quarterback]] [[Jason Campbell]], with the 25th overall pick.  On August 2, 2005, Rogers agreed to a five-year contract worth a maximum of $17.45 million over the life of the contract with $11.23 million in bonuses.<ref>{{cite web | work=[[ESPN]] | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2122445 | title=Redskins' first pick Rogers gets five-year contract | accessdate=2010-06-01}}</ref>

====2005 season====
After an ankle injury forced him to miss the first preseason game, Rogers played in his first game on August 19, a preseason loss to the [[Cincinnati Bengals]].  In the game, he intercepted a pass from [[Carson Palmer]] and returned the ball to Cincinnati's 25-yard line.  On the next play, Redskins quarterback [[Patrick Ramsey]] threw a touchdown pass to [[James Thrash]].<ref>{{cite web | work=[[ESPN]] | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=250819028 | title=Palmer, Ramsey struggle for second week | accessdate=2010-06-01}}</ref>  Rogers made his first NFL regular season start on October 2, in an overtime win against the [[Seattle Seahawks]] during which he had seven tackles (five individual) and one forced fumble.<ref name=redskins /><ref>{{cite web | work=[[ESPN]] | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=251002028 | title=Seahawks' missed FG sends Redskins into OT, win | accessdate=2010-06-01}}</ref>  In an overtime loss to the [[San Diego Chargers]] on November 27, he recorded his first NFL interception off of [[Drew Brees]].  He also had a team-high eight tackles (seven individual) and three pass deflections.<ref name=rogers /><ref>{{cite web | work=[[ESPN]] | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=251127028 | title=LT's 41-yard TD run lifts Chargers over Redskins in OT | accessdate=2010-06-01}}</ref>  The following week in a win against the [[St. Louis Rams]], Rogers intercepted [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] and had six tackles.

Rogers appeared in 12 regular season games and started five games.  He finished the season with 40 tackles (34 individual), two interceptions, four pass deflections and two forced fumbles.<ref name=redskins />  He also started the Redskins' two postseason games, in which he recorded 13 tackles and one pass deflection.<ref name=rogers /><ref>{{cite web | work=[[National Football League|NFL.com]] | url=http://www.nfl.com/players/carlosrogers/gamelogs?id=ROG136198&season=2005 | title=Carlos Rogers: Game Logs 2005 | accessdate=2010-06-01}}</ref>

====2006 season====
Rogers started 15 games and recorded a career-high 88 tackles (71 individual), one interception and 17 pass deflections.<ref name=redskins />  He was inactive during the [[Indianapolis Colts]] loss on October 22, due to a fractured thumb.<ref>{{cite web | work=[[ESPN]] | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2630923 | title=Broken thumb to sideline Skins CB Rogers vs. Colts | accessdate=2010-06-01}}</ref>

====2007 season====
On October 7, Rogers recorded his first career interception return for a touchdown, when he intercepted a pass from [[Jon Kitna]] and returned it a career-best 61 yards in the 34-3 win over the [[Detroit Lions]].<ref name=redskins /><ref>{{cite web | work=[[ESPN]] | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=271007028 | title=Campbell, Redskins continue '07 turnaround with rout of Lions | accessdate=2010-06-01}}</ref>  He started the first seven games of the season before he tore his [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] and [[Medial collateral ligament|MCL]] in a loss against the [[New England Patriots]] on October 28.  It was decided that surgery was the best option and he was placed on injured reserve on October 30.<ref name=redskins /><ref>{{cite web | work=[[ESPN]] | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3085834 | title=Rogers to have surgery on right knee after MCL, ACL tears | accessdate=2010-06-01}}</ref>  Rogers recorded 30 tackles (23 individual), one interception and eight pass deflections during this shortened season.<ref name=redskins />

====2008 season====
Rogers returned from his knee injury from the previous season and started in the first game, a 16-7 loss to the [[New York Giants]].<ref name=rogers />  On September 21, he started the game vs. the [[Arizona Cardinals]] by jumping on an [[Edgerrin James]] fumble on the Cardinals 34 yard line in the first quarter which resulted in a Redskins field goal four plays later.  He later made a diving interception against [[Kurt Warner]] of the [[Arizona Cardinals]] in the fourth quarter.  Rogers then got to his feet, avoided a tackle by [[Larry Fitzgerald]], and ran 42 yards to the 15-yard line.  Two plays later, [[Santana Moss]] caught a short pass from [[Jason Campbell]] and scooted in 17 yards for the score, giving the Redskins a 24-17 victory.<ref>{{cite web | work=[[ESPN]] | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=280921028 | title=Rogers' interception puts Redskins in gear vs. Cardinals | accessdate=2010-06-01}}</ref>  The following game was at [[Texas Stadium]] vs. the [[Dallas Cowboys]].  Although [[Shawn Springs]] was assigned to cover the Cowboys #1 receiver, [[Terrell Owens]], Springs became injured in the middle of the third quarter.  With a three point lead and the game on the line, the responsibility of covering T.O. on short to intermediate routes fell to Rogers.  From that point forward, Rogers and the Washington defense held T.O. to two receptions on eight pass attempts, including three passes in a row from [[Tony Romo]] to T.O. into Rogers's coverage at the beginning of the 4th quarter - all incompletions.  Redskins won 26-24 and the game was chosen as the [[NFL Films Game Of The Week]].  Rogers acquired 7 tackles (6 solo) during the game, which was the high for the team that game and Rogers' high for the entire year.  Rogers played in all 16 regular season games for the first time in his career, with 14 starts.  He finished the season with 53 tackles (45 individual), two interceptions, 77 interception return yards and one fumble recovery.<ref name=rogers />

====2009 season====
Rogers played in 16 regular season games with 15 starts in 2009.  He recorded 46 tackles (34 individual), two fumble recoveries and a team-high 12 pass deflections.  He helped the Redskins defense finish tenth in the league in overall defense and ninth in pass defense.<ref name=redskins />

====2010 season====
Rogers played and started 12 games and recorded 54 combined tackles, 12 pass break-ups, two interceptions, and one forced fumble.

===San Francisco 49ers===
====2011 Season====
On August 2, 2011, he signed a one-year contract with the San Francisco 49ers. He went on to lead the team with six interceptions that year and was named a starter on the NFC Pro Bowl roster as well as a Second-team All-Pro by the Associated Press. 

====2012 Season====
On March 14, 2012, Rogers re-signed with the team to a four-year, $31.3 million contract.<ref>{{cite news|work=SFGate.com|url=http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/49ers-re-sign-Carlos-Rogers-defense-stays-intact-3406804.php|title=49ers re-sign Carlos Rogers, defense stays intact|last=Branch| first=Eric|date=March 14, 2012|accessdate=2012-07-17}}</ref> He made the [[NFL Top 100#2012|NFL Network's Top 100 Players of 2012 list]] at rank #69.<ref>{{cite web|work=NinersNation.com|url=http://www.ninersnation.com/2012/5/16/3025464/nfl-top-100-joe-staley-carlos-rogers-ranking|title=NFL Top 100: Joe Staley Ranked No. 67, Carlos Rogers Ranked No. 69|last=Fucillo|first=David|date=May 16, 2012|accessdate=2012-07-17}}</ref>
