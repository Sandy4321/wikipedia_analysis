It is a large, [[crow]]-sized [[falcon]], with a blue-gray back, barred white underparts, and a black head and "moustache". Experts recognize 17 to 19 [[subspecies]] which vary in appearance and range; there is disagreement over whether the distinctive [[Barbary Falcon]] is a subspecies or a distinct [[species]]. Typical of [[avivore|bird-eating]] raptors, all subspecies of ''F. peregrinus,'' including the [[Nominate race|nominate]], are [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], with females being considerably larger than males.<ref name="White94">{{citation|author=White, C.M. et al.|contribution=Family Falconidae|title=Handbook of Birds of the World: New World Vultures to Guineafowl|editor=del Hoyo, J., Elliot, A. and Sargatal, J.|publisher=Lynx Edicions|location=Barcelona|year=1994|volume=2|pages=216<U+2013>275, plates 24<U+2013>28|isbn=84-87334-15-6}}</ref><ref name=bwp>{{citation|author=Snow, D.W. et al.|year=1998|title=The complete birds of the western Palaearctic on CD-ROM|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-268579-1}}</ref> 

The Peregrine's breeding range includes land regions from the [[Arctic tundra]] to the [[tropics]]. It can be found nearly everywhere on Earth, except extreme [[polar region]]s, very high mountains, and most tropical [[rainforest]]s; the only major ice-free landmass from which it is entirely absent is [[New Zealand]]. This makes it the world's most widespread bird of prey.<ref>{{citation|last1=Ferguson-Lees|first1=J.|last2=Christie|first2=D.A.|title=Raptors of the World|publisher=Christopher Helm|location=London|year=2001|isbn=0-7136-8026-1}}</ref> Both the [[English language|English]] and scientific names of this species mean "wandering falcon", referring to the [[bird migration|migratory]] habits of many northern populations. 

While its diet consists almost exclusively of medium-sized birds, the Peregrine will occasionally hunt small mammals, small reptiles or even insects. Reaching sexual maturity at one year, it mates for life and nests in a [[Bird nest#Scrape|scrape]], normally on cliff edges or, in recent times, on tall human-made structures.<ref>{{citation|author=Cade, T.J. et al.|contribution=Peregrine Falcons in Urban North America|title=Raptors in Human Landscapes|editor=Bird, D.M., D.E.

[[Image:Peregrine Falcon in flight.jpg|thumb|left|''F. p. anatum'' in flight, [[Morro Bay, California]]]]
This species was first described by English ornithologist [[Marmaduke Tunstall]] in his 1771 ''Ornithologia Britannica'' under its current binomial name.<ref>{{la icon}} {{Citation | last=Tunstall | first=Marmaduke  | authorlink= Marmaduke Tunstall | title= Ornithologia Britannica: seu Avium omnium Britannicarum tam terrrestrium, quam aquaticarum catalogus, sermone Latino, Anglico et Gallico redditus: cui subjuctur appendix avec alennigenas, in Angliam raro advenientes, complectens. | publisher=London, J. Dixwell | year=1771| quote = |pages=}}</ref> The scientific name ''Falco peregrinus'' means "wandering falcon" in [[Latin]].<ref>{{citation|author=University of Minnesota|url=http://www.raptor.cvm.umn.edu/learn/info/peregrinefalcon/home.html|title=Peregrine Falcon|year=2004|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> Indeed, the species' common name refers to its wide-ranging flights in most European languages.<ref>e.g. [[French (language)|French]] ''faucon [[wikt:p<U+00E8>lerin|p<U+00E8>lerin]]'', [[German (language)|German]] ''[[wikt:wandern|Wanderfalke]]'', [[Italian (language)|Italian]] ''falco [[wikt:pellegrino|pellegrino]]'', [[Polish (language)|Polish]] ''sok<U+00F3><U+0142> w<U+0119>drowny'', [[Slovak (language)|Slovak]] ''sokol s<U+0165>ahovav<U+00FD>'', [[Swedish (language)|Swedish]] ''pilgrimsfalk''</ref> The Latin term for falcon, ''falco'', is related to ''falx'', the Latin word meaning [[sickle]], in reference to the silhouette of the falcon's long, pointed wings in flight.<ref name="F&WL" /> 

The Peregrine Falcon belongs to a [[genus]] whose lineage includes the [[hierofalcon]]s<ref>''Contra'' Helbig ''et al.'' (1994), Wink ''et al.'' (1998). The supposed [[basal (biology)|basal]] position of the hierofalcons was due to them having a [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] [[numt]]: see Wink & Sauer-G<U+00FC>rth (2000)</ref> and the [[Prairie Falcon]]  (''F.&nbsp;mexicanus''). This lineage probably diverged from other falcons towards the end of the [[Late Miocene]] or in the [[Early Pliocene]], about 8<U+2013>5&nbsp;[[million years ago]] (mya). As the Peregrine-hierofalcon group includes both [[Old World]] and North American species, it is likely that the lineage originated in western [[Eurasia]] or Africa. Its relationship to other falcons is not clear; the issue is complicated by widespread [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] confounding [[mtDNA]] [[DNA sequence|sequence]] analyses; for example a genetic lineage of the [[Saker Falcon]] (''F.&nbsp;cherrug'') is known<ref>Helbig ''et al.'' (1994), Wink ''et al.'' (1998)</ref> which originated from a male Saker producing fertile young with a female Peregrine ancestor.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Today, Peregrines are regularly hybridized in captivity with other species such as the [[Lanner Falcon]] (''F.&nbsp;biarmicus'') to produce the "[[perilanner]]", a somewhat popular bird in [[falconry]] as it combines the Peregrine's hunting skill with the Lanner's hardiness, or the [[Gyrfalcon]] to produce large, strikingly colored birds for the use of falconers. As can be seen, the Peregrine is still genetically close to the hierofalcons, though their lineages diverged in the [[Late Pliocene]] (maybe some 2.5<U+2013>2&nbsp;mya in the [[Gelasian]]).<ref>Helbig ''et al.'' (1994), Wink ''et al.'' (1998), Griffiths (1999), Wink & Sauer-G<U+00FC>rth (2000), Groombridge ''et al.'' (2002), Griffiths ''et al.'' (2004), Nittinger ''et al.'' (2005)</ref>

===Feeding===
[[Image:Falco peregrinus on ship USFWS.jpg|thumb|Immature  using a [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|USFWS]] ship as a perch on which to eat its prey.]]
The Peregrine Falcon feeds almost exclusively on medium-sized birds such as [[Columbidae|doves]], [[waterfowl]], [[songbird]]s, [[wader]]s and [[pigeon]]s.<ref name="Beckstead"/> Worldwide, it is estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 bird species (up to roughly a fifth of the world's bird species) are predated by these falcons. In [[North America]], prey has varied in size from 3-g [[hummingbird]]s to a 3.1-kg [[Sandhill Crane]] (killed by a peregrine in a swoop).<ref>http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/660/articles/foodhabits</ref> Prey also include the small raptor, the [[American Kestrel]].<ref>C.Michael Hogan, ed. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/American_kestrel ''American Kestrel''. Encyclopedia of Earth, U.S. National Council for Science and the Environment, Ed-in-chief C.Cleveland]</ref> Other than bats taken at night,<ref name= BB101/> it rarely hunts small mammals, but will on occasion take [[rat]]s, [[vole]]s, [[hare]]s, shrews, [[mouse|mice]] and [[squirrel]]s; the coastal populations of the large subspecies ''pealei'' feed almost exclusively on [[seabird]]s.<ref name="Terres91" /> In the Brazilian [[mangrove]] swamp of [[Cubat<U+00E3>o]], a wintering falcon of the subspecies ''tundrius'' was observed while successfully hunting a juvenile [[Scarlet Ibis]].<ref>{{citation|author=Olmos, F. and Silva e Silva, R.|year=2003|title=Guar<U+00E1>: Ambiente , Fauna e Flora dos Manguezais de Santos-Cubat<U+00E3>o, Brasil|location=S<U+00E3>o Paulo|publisher=Empresa das Artes|isbn=85-89138-06-2|page=111}}</ref> Insects and reptiles make up a small proportion of the diet, which varies greatly depending on what prey is available.<ref name="Beckstead"/> In urban areas, the main item of the Peregrine's diet is the [[Rock Pigeon|Rock]] or [[Feral Pigeon]], which comprise 80% or more of the dietary intake for peregrines in some cities. Other common city birds are also taken regularly, such as [[Mourning Dove]]s, [[Common Swift]]s, [[Northern Flicker]]s, [[Common Starling]]s, [[American Robin]]s and various [[corvid]]s ([[Magpie]]s and [[Carrion Crow]]s mostly).<ref name= BB101/> 

The Peregrine Falcon hunts at dawn and dusk, when prey are most active, but in cities  also nocturnally, particularly during migration periods when hunting at night may become prevalent. Nocturnal  migrants taken by Peregrines include species as diverse as [[Yellow-billed Cuckoo]], [[Black-necked Grebe]], [[Virginia Rail]] and [[Common Quail]].<ref name= BB101>{{citation|author = Drewitt, E.J.A. and Dixon, N.|month= February|year=2008 |title=Diet and prey selection of urban-dwelling Peregrine Falcons in southwest England |journal= British Birds |volume= 101 |issue= |pages= 58<U+2013>67}}</ref> It requires open space in order to hunt, and therefore often hunts over open water, [[marsh]]es, [[valley]]s, fields and [[tundra]]. It searches for prey either from a high perch or from the air.<ref name="Ehrlich92">{{citation|author=Ehrlich, P., Dobkin, D. and Wheye, D.|title=Birds in Jeopardy: The Imperiled and Extinct Birds of the United States|year=1992|publisher=Standford University Press|isbn=0-8047-1981-0}}</ref> Once prey is spotted, it begins its stoop, folding back the tail and wings, with feet tucked.<ref name="Terres91" /> The air pressure from a {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} dive could possibly damage a bird's [[lung]]s, but small bony tubercles on a falcon's nostrils guide the powerful airflow away from the nostrils, enabling the bird to breathe more easily while diving by reducing the change in air pressure.<ref name="Wisconsin"/> To protect their eyes, the falcons use their [[nictitating membrane]]s (third eyelids) to spread tears and clear debris from their eyes while maintaining vision. Prey is struck and captured in mid-air; the Peregrine Falcon strikes its prey with a clenched foot, stunning or killing it, then turns to catch it in mid-air.<ref name="Ehrlich92"/> The Peregrine will drop it to the ground and eat it there if it is too heavy to carry. Prey is plucked before consumption.<ref name="Wisconsin">Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources</ref>

===Reproduction===

[[Image:Faucon pelerin 7 mai.jpg||thumb|right|At nest, France]]
The Peregrine Falcon is sexually mature at the end of the first year of age but in healthy populations they breed after two to three years of age. The pair mates for life and returns to the same nesting spot annually. The courtship flight includes a mix of aerial acrobatics, precise spirals, and steep dives.<ref name="Dewey"/> The male passes prey it has caught to the female in mid-air. To make this possible, the female actually flies upside-down to receive the food from the male's talons. The Peregrine Falcon is territorial during the breeding season; nesting pairs are usually more than 1&nbsp;km (0.6&nbsp;miles) apart, and often much farther, even in areas with large numbers of pairs.<ref name="Blood01">{{citation|author=Blood, D. and Banasch, U.|year=2001|url=http://www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?id=60|title=Hinterland Who's Who Bird Fact Sheets: Peregrine Falcon|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> The distance between nests ensures sufficient food supply for pairs and their chicks. Within a breeding territory, a pair may have several nesting ledges; the number used by a pair can vary from one or two to seven in a 16&nbsp;year period. The pair defends the chosen nest site against other Peregrines, and often against [[raven]]s, [[heron]]s, [[gull]]s and (in ground nest) mammals like [[fox]]es, [[wolverine]]s, [[felid]]s, [[bear]]s and [[gray wolf|wolves]].<ref name="Blood01"/> Both nests and (less frequently) adults are predated by larger-bodied raptorial birds like [[eagle]]s, large [[Horned owl|owl]]s, or [[Gyrfalcon]]s. Peregrines defending their nests have managed to kill raptors as large as [[Golden Eagle]]s and [[Bald Eagle]]s (both of which they normally avoid as potential predators) that have come close to the nest.<ref>http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/660/articles/behavior</ref>

The Peregrine Falcon nests in a scrape, normally on cliff edges or, today regularly in many parts of its range, on tall buildings or bridges. Cliff nests are generally located under an overhang, on ledges with vegetation, and south-facing sites are favored.<ref name="Terres91" /> In some regions, as in parts of [[Australia]] and on the west coast of Northern North-America, large tree hollows are used for nesting. Before the demise of most European peregrines, there was a large population of peregrines in central and western Europe using the disused nests of other large birds.<ref name="Beckstead"/> The female chooses a nest site, where she scrapes a shallow hollow in the loose soil, sand, gravel, or dead vegetation in which to lay eggs. No nest materials are added.<ref name="Dewey"/> In remote, undisturbed areas such as the Arctic, steep slopes and even low rocks and mounds may be used as nest sites. The human-made structures used for breeding closely resemble the natural cliff ledges that the Peregrine prefers for its nesting locations.<ref name="White94"/><ref name="Blood01"/>

[[Image:Peregrine falcon chick.jpg|thumb|left|Chick]]
Mostly three to four eggs (range 1<U+2013>5) are laid in the scrape.<ref name="Peterson">Peterson, R. T (1976):p.171</ref> The eggs are white to buff with red or brown markings.<ref name="Peterson"/> They are incubated for 29 to 33 days, mainly by the female.<ref name="Terres91" /> The male also helps with the incubation of the eggs over day, but at night only the female incubates. The date of egg-laying varies according to locality, but is generally from February to March in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and from July to August in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] (the Australian subspecies ''macropus'' may breed as late as November and [[equator]]ial populations may nest anytime between June and December). The female generally lays another clutch if the eggs are lost early in the nesting season, though this is extremely rare in the Arctic owing to the short summer season. As a result of some infertile eggs and natural losses of nestlings, the average number of young found in nests is 2.5, and the average number that fledges is about 1.5.<ref name="White94"/><ref name=Michigan/><ref name="Wisconsin"/>

After hatching, the eyases,<ref>Taken from http://www.raptorresource.org/facts.htm</ref> or chicks, are covered with creamy-white down and have disproportionately large feet.<ref name="Blood01"/> The male, which is called the "tiercel", and the female, which is simply called the "falcon", both leave the nest to gather prey to feed the young.<ref name="Wisconsin"/> The hunting territory of the parents can extend a radius of 19 to 24&nbsp;km (12<U+2013>15 miles) from the nest site.<ref>Towry (1987)</ref> Chicks fledge 42 to 46 days after hatching, and remain dependent on their parents for up to two months.<ref name="Snow (1994)">Snow (1994)</ref>

==Relationship with humans==
===Pesticides===
The Peregrine Falcon became an endangered species because of the use of organocholorine pesticides, especially [[DDT]] during the 1950s, 60s, and 70s.<ref>T. J. Cade, J. H. Enderson, C. G. Thelander & C. M. White (Eds): ''Peregrine Falcon Populations <U+2013> Their management and recovery''. The Peregrine Fund, Boise, Idaho, 1988. ISBN 0-9619839-0-6</ref> Pesticide [[biomagnification]] caused [[organochlorine]] to build up in the falcons' fat tissues, reducing the amount of calcium in their eggshells. With thinner shells, fewer falcon eggs survived to hatching.<ref name="Ehrlich92"/><ref>Brown (1976)</ref> In several parts of the world, such as the eastern USA and [[Belgium]], this species became [[local extinction|locally extinct]] as a result.<ref name="Snow (1994)"/>

===Falconry===
[[File:Falco peregrinus tethered.jpg|thumb|right|''Falco peregrinus'' tethered]]
The Peregrine Falcon was used in [[falconry]] for more than 3,000 years, beginning with nomads in central Asia.<ref name="Blood01"/> Due to its ability to dive at high speeds, it was highly sought-after and generally used by experienced falconers.<ref name="Scholz" /> Peregrine Falcons are also occasionally used to scare away birds at airports to reduce the risk of [[Bird strike|bird-plane strikes]], improving air-traffic safety,<ref>{{citation|author=Kuzir, S. and Muzini, J.|year=1999|title=Birds and air traffic safety on Zagreb airport (Croatia)|journal=The Environmentalist|volume=18|pages=231<U+2013>237|doi=10.1023/A:1006541304592|issue=4}}</ref> and were used to intercept homing pigeons during World War II.<ref name= Enderson >{{Citation| last = Enderson | first = James | coauthors= Katona, Robert (illustrator)| title = Peregrine Falcon: Stories of the Blue Meanie | year = 2005 | publisher = University of Texas Press | isbn = 0-292-70624-3 |page = 175}}</ref> Peregrine eggs and chicks are often targeted by illegal collectors,<ref>{{citation|author=www.scientific-web.com|year=2011 |url=http://www.scientific-web.com/en/Biology/Animalia/Chordata/Aves/FalcoPeregrinus01.html |title=www.scientific-web.com|accessdate=2011-05-11}}</ref> so it is common practice not to publicize unprotected nest locations.<ref>{{citation|author=American Birding Association|year=2005 |url=http://www.aba.org/about/ethics.html |title=Code of Birding Ethics|publisher=American Birding Association, Inc.|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref>

===Recovery efforts===
In the [[USA]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]] and [[Poland]], Wildlife services in Peregrine Falcon recovery teams breed the species in captivity.<ref name="RDigest">{{citation|author=Cassidy, J. and Reader's Digest Editors|title=Book of North American Birds|publisher=Reader's Digest|isbn=0-89577-351-1|url=http://books.google.com/?id=eKU-5_7lfXMC&dq|year=2005|accessdate=2008-05-26|page=34}}</ref> The chicks are usually fed through a chute or with a [[hand puppet]] mimicking a Peregrine's head, so they cannot see to [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprint]] on the human trainers.<ref name="DOI95"/> Then, when they are old enough, the rearing box is opened, allowing the bird to train its wings. As the fledgling gets stronger, feeding is reduced forcing the bird to learn to hunt. This procedure is called [[hack (falconry)|hacking back to the wild]].<ref name="Aitken">{{citation|author=Aitken, G.|year=2004|title=A New Approach to Conservation|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=0-7546-3283-0|page=126|url=http://books.google.com/?id=IAu-MzZbAPMC&dq|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> To release a captive-bred falcon, the bird is placed in a special cage at the top of a tower or cliff ledge for some days or so, allowing it to acclimate itself to its future environment.<ref name="Aitken"/>

===Current status===
[[Image:BL4F7621-2.jpg|upright|thumb|Peregrine Falcon on the [[Ambassador Bridge]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]]]]
Populations of the Peregrine Falcon have bounced back in most parts of the world. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], there has been a recovery of populations since the crash of the 1960s. This has been greatly assisted by conservation and protection work led by the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]]. Peregrines now breed in many mountainous and coastal areas, especially in the west and north, and nest in some urban areas, capitalizing on the urban pigeon populations for food.<ref>{{citation|author=The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/p/peregrine/threats.asp|year=2003|title=Peregrine Falcon: Threats|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> In many parts of the world Peregrine Falcons have adapted to urban habitats, nesting on [[cathedral]]s, [[skyscraper]] window ledges, and the towers of [[suspension bridge]]s. Many of these nesting birds are encouraged, sometimes gathering media attention and often monitored by cameras.<ref>{{citenews|title=Record Number of Peregrine Falcons in New York State|date=2009-02-12|last=Navarro|first=Mireya|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/nyregion/13falcon.html|accessdate=2009-02-13|work=New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{citenews|title=Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Group WebCam|date=2011-03-11|url=http://www2.ucsc.edu/scpbrg/nestcamSF.htm|accessdate=2011-03-11|work=Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group}}</ref>
