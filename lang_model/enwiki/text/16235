The '''antbirds''' are a large [[family (biology)|family]], '''Thamnophilidae''', of [[passerine]] [[bird]]s found across subtropical and tropical Central and South America, from Mexico to Argentina. There are [[List of antbirds|more than 200 species]], known variously as antshrikes, antwrens, antvireos, fire-eyes, bare-eyes and bushbirds. They are related to the antthrushes and antpittas (family [[Formicariidae]]), the [[tapaculo]]s, the [[gnateater]]s and the [[Ovenbird (family)|ovenbirds]]. Despite some species' common names, this family is not closely related to the [[wren]]s, [[vireo]]s or [[shrike]]s.

Antbirds are generally small birds with rounded wings and strong legs. They have mostly sombre grey, white, brown and [[rufous]] [[plumage]], which is [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] in pattern and colouring. Some species communicate warnings to rivals by exposing white feather patches on their backs or shoulders. Most have heavy [[beak|bills]], which in many species are hooked at the tip.

Most species live in forests, although a few are found in other habitats. [[Insect]]s and other arthropods form the most important part of their diet, although small vertebrates are occasionally taken. Most species feed in the [[understory]] and midstory of the forest, although a few feed in the [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] and a few on the ground. Many join [[mixed-species foraging flock|mixed-species feeding flock]]s, and a few species are core members. To various degrees, around eighteen species specialise in [[ant follower|following]] columns of [[Ecitoninae|army ant]]s to eat the small [[invertebrate]]s flushed by the ants, and many others may feed in this way opportunistically.

Antbirds are [[monogamy|monogamous]], mate for life, and defend [[Territory (animal)|territories]]. They usually lay two eggs in a nest that is either suspended from branches or supported on a branch, stump, or mound on the ground. Both parents share the tasks of [[avian incubation|incubation]] and of brooding and feeding the nestlings. After [[fledge|fledging]], each parent cares exclusively for one chick.

Thirty-eight species are threatened with extinction as a result of human activities. Antbirds are not targeted by either hunters or the pet trade. The principal threat is [[habitat destruction|habitat loss]], which causes [[habitat fragmentation]] and increased nest predation in habitat fragments.

== Systematics ==
{{see also|List of antbirds}}
The antbird family Thamnophilidae used to be considered  a subfamily, Thamnophilinae, within a larger family [[Formicariidae]] that included [[formicariidae|antthrush]]es and [[formicariidae|antpitta]]s. Formerly, that larger family was known as the "antbird family" and the Thamnophilinae were "typical antbirds". In this article, "antbird" and "antbird family" refer to the family Thamnophilidae.

Thamnophilidae was removed from Formicariidae, leaving behind the antthrushes and antpittas, due to recognition of differences in the structure of the breastbone ([[sternum]]) and [[Syrinx (biology)|syrinx]], and [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy of birds|Sibley and Ahlquist's]] examination of [[DNA-DNA hybridization|DNA-DNA hybridisation]].<ref>[[Charles Sibley|Sibley, C. G.]] and [[Jon Edward Ahlquist|Ahlquist, J. E.]] (1990) [http://google.com/books?id=cfjAvuxL-9wC&printsec=frontcover ''Phylogeny and classification of birds'']. Yale University Press, New Haven, Conn. ISBN 0300040857.</ref><ref name = "Rice"/> The Thamnophilidae antbirds are members of the infraorder Tyrannides (or [[Tyranni|tracheophone suboscines]]), one of two infraorders in the suborder Tyranni. The Thamnophilidae are now thought to occupy a fairly [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] position within the infraorder, i. e. with regard to their relatives the antthrushes and antpittas, [[tapaculo]]s, [[gnateater]]s, and also the [[Ovenbird (family)|ovenbirds]].<ref name = "Irestedt2002"/> The sister group of the Thamnophilidae is thought to be the gnateaters. The ovenbirds, tapaculos, antthrushes and antpittas are thought to represent a different radiation of that early split.<!-- needs a ref, also meaning is unclear; try writing it out as nested parentheses, then expand into words -->

The antbird family contains over 200 species, variously called antwrens, antvireos, antbirds and antshrikes. The names refer to the relative sizes of the birds (increasing in the order given, though with exceptions) rather than any particular resemblance to the true [[wren]]s, [[vireo]]s or [[shrike]]s. In addition, members of the genus ''Phlegopsis'' are known as [[phlegopsis|bare-eye]]s, ''Pyriglena'' as [[pyriglena|fire-eye]]s and ''Neoctantes'' and ''Clytoctantes'' as [[Clytoctantes|bushbird]]s. Although the systematics of the Thamnophilidae is based on studies from the mid-19th century, when fewer than half the present species were known, comparison of the [[myoglobin]] [[intron]] 2, [[Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase|GAPDH]] intron 11 and the [[mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence]]s has largely confirmed it.<ref name = "Irestedt 2004"/> There are two major [[clade]]s <U+2013> most antshrikes and other larger, strong-billed species as well as ''[[Herpsilochmus]]'', versus the classical antwrens and other more slender, longer-billed species <U+2013> and the [[monophyly]] of most genera was confirmed.

The Thamnophilidae contains several large or very large [[genus|genera]] and numerous small or [[monotypic taxon|monotypic]] ones. Several, which are difficult to assign, seem to form a third, hitherto unrecognised clade independently derived from ancestral antbirds.<ref name = "Irestedt 2004"/> The results also confirmed suspicions of previous researchers that some species, most notably in ''[[Myrmotherula]]'' and ''[[Myrmeciza]]'', need to be assigned to other genera. Still, due to the difficulties of sampling from such a large number of often poorly known species, the assignment of some genera is still awaiting confirmation.

== Morphology ==

[[File:Gymnopithys-leucaspis-001 edit2.jpg|thumb|left|The legs and feet of [[ant follower|ant-following]] antbirds are stable and adapted to gripping vertical stems and branches. The leg muscles of the [[Bicolored Antbird|Bicoloured Antbird]] make up 13&nbsp;% of the total body weight.]]
The antbirds are a group of small to medium-sized [[passerine]]s that range in size from the large [[Giant Antshrike]], which measures 45&nbsp;cm (18&nbsp;in) and weighs 150&nbsp; [[gram|g]] (5.29&nbsp; [[ounce|oz]]), to the tiny 8-cm (3&nbsp;in) [[Pygmy Antwren]], which weighs 7&nbsp; g (0.25&nbsp;oz).<ref name = "HBW">Zimmer, K. and Isler, M.  (2003) "Family Thamnophilidae (Typical Antbirds)" pp. 459<U+2013>531 ''in'' del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. and Christie D. (editors). (2003). ''[[Handbook of the Birds of the World]]. Volume 8'': Broadbills to Tapaculos. Lynx Edicions. ISBN 84-87334-50-4</ref> In general terms, "antshrikes" are relatively large-bodied birds, "antvireos" are medium-sized and chunky, while "antwrens" include most smaller species; "antbird" genera can vary greatly in size. Members of this family have short rounded wings that provide good manoeuvrability when [[bird flight|flying]] in dense undergrowth. The legs are large and strong, particularly in species that are obligate [[ant-follower]]s. These species are well adapted to gripping vertical stems and [[tree|sapling]]s, which are more common than horizontal branches in the undergrowth, and thus the ability to grip them is an advantage for birds following swarms of army ants. The claws of these antbirds are longer than those of species that do not follow ants, and the soles of some species have projections that are tough and gripping when the foot is clenched. [[Tarsus (skeleton)|Tarsus]] length in antbirds is related to foraging strategy. Longer tarsi typically occur in genera such as the ''[[Thamnophilus]]'' antshrikes that forage by perch-[[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] (sitting and leaning forward to snatch insects from the branch), whereas shorter tarsi typically occur in those that catch prey on the wing, such as the ''[[Thamnomanes]]'' antshrikes.<ref name = "Schulenberg"/>

Most antbirds have proportionately large, heavy [[beak|bills]].<ref name = "Schulenberg"/> Several genera of antshrike have a strongly hooked tip to the bill, and all antbirds have a notch or 'tooth' at the tip of the bill which helps in holding and crushing insect prey. The two [[genus|genera]] of bushbirds have upturned chisel-like bills.<ref name=Lanyon/>

The [[plumage]] of antbirds is soft and not brightly coloured, although it is occasionally striking.<ref name = "HBW"/> The colour palette of most species is blackish shades, whitish shades, rufous, chestnut and brown. Plumages can be uniform in colour or patterned with barring or spots. [[Sexual dimorphism]] <U+2013> differences in plumage colour and pattern between males and females <U+2013> is common in the family. Overall the pattern within the family is for the males to have combinations of grey, black or white plumage and the females having buff, rufous and brown colours. For example, the male [[Dot-winged Antwren]] is primarily blackish, whereas the female has rust-coloured underparts.<ref name = "Greenberg"/> In some genera, such as ''Myrmotherula'', species are better distinguished by female plumage than by male.<ref>Rice, N. H. and Hutson, A. M. (2003) "Antbirds". pp. 446<U+2013>449 ''in'' [[Chris Perrins|Perrins, C.]] (editor). (2003). ''Firefly Encyclopedia of Birds. '' Firefly Books. ISBN 1-55297-777-3</ref> Many species of antbirds have a contrasting 'patch' of white (sometimes other colours) feathers on the back (known as interscapular patches), shoulder or underwing. This is usually concealed by the darker feathers on the back but when the bird is excited or alarmed these feathers can be raised to flash the white patch. Dot-winged Antwrens puff out white back patches, whereas in [[Bluish-slate Antshrike]]s and [[White-flanked Antwren]]s the white patch is on the shoulder.<ref name = "Munn"/>

=== Voice ===

[[File:Song of Thamnophilus doliatus.ogg|right|thumb|Song of the [[Barred Antshrike]]]]
The [[Bird vocalization|songs and calls]] of antbirds are generally composed of repeated simple uncomplicated notes. The family is one of the suboscines (suborder [[Tyranni]]) which have simpler [[Syrinx (biology)|syrinxes]] ("voiceboxes") than other songbirds. Nevertheless their songs are distinctive and species-specific, allowing field identification by ear.<ref name ="HBW"/> Antbirds rely on their calls for communication, as is typical of birds in dark forests. Most species have at least two types of call, the ''loudsong'' and the ''softsong''. The functions of many calls have been deduced from their context; for example some loudsongs have a [[territory (animal)|territorial purpose]] and are given when birds meet at the edges of their territories, or during the morning rounds of the territory. Pairs in neighbouring territories judge the proximity of rivals by the degradation of the song caused by interference by the environment.<ref name=Morton/> In bouts of territorial defence the male will face off with the other male and the female with her counterpart.<ref name ="HBW"/> Loudsong duets are also potentially related to the maintenance of pair bonds.<ref name=Seddon/> The functions of softsongs are more complex, and possibly related to pair-bond maintenance. In addition to these two main calls a range of other sounds are made; these include scolding in [[Animal mobbing behavior|mobbing]] of predators.<ref name ="antwren coop"/> The calls of antbirds are also used interspecifically. Some species of antbirds and even other birds will actively seek out ant-swarms using the calls of some species of ant-followers as clues.<ref name = "calls"/>

== Distribution and habitat ==

[[File:Thamnophilus doliatus.jpg|thumb|The [[Barred Antshrike]] is distributed from Mexico to Argentina. It has the hooked bill typical of the antshrikes.]]
The distribution of the antbirds is entirely [[Neotropic ecozone|Neotropical]], with the vast majority of the species being found in the tropics. A few species reach southern Mexico and northern Argentina. Some species, such as the [[Barred Antshrike]], have a continental distribution that spans most of the South and [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle American]] distribution of the family; others, such as the [[Ash-throated Antwren]], have a tiny distribution.<ref>[[BirdLife International]] (2007) [http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=4672&m=0 Species factsheet: ''Herpsilochmus parkeri''.] Accessed on 3 April 2008</ref>

Antbirds are mostly birds of humid lowland [[rainforest]]s.<ref name = "HBW"/> Few species are found at higher elevations, with less than 10% of species having ranges above 2000&nbsp; m (6500&nbsp;ft) and almost none with ranges above 3000&nbsp; m (10000&nbsp;ft). The highest species diversity is found in the [[Amazon Basin]], with up to 45 species being found in single locations in sites across [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]]. The number of species drops dramatically towards the further reaches of the family's range; there are only seven species in Mexico, for example. Areas of lower thamnophilid diversity may contain localised [[Endemism|endemics]], however. The [[Yapacana Antbird]], for example, is restricted to the stunted woodlands that grow in areas of nutrient-poor white-sand [[soil]] (the so-called Amazonian [[caatinga]]) in Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia.<ref name = "Zimmer"/> Some species are predominantly associated with microhabitats within a greater ecosystem; for example, the [[Bamboo Antshrike]] is predominantly found in bamboo patches.<ref name=Pierpont/>

== Behaviour ==

Antbirds are [[diurnality|diurnal]]: they feed, breed and defend territories during the day. Many of the family are, however, reluctant to enter areas of direct sunlight where it breaks through the forest canopy. Antbirds will engage in [[Anting (bird activity)|anting]], a behaviour in which ants (or other arthropods) are rubbed on the feathers before being discarded or eaten.<ref name = "Willis"/> While this has conventionally been considered a way to remove and control feather [[parasitism|parasite]]s, it has been suggested that for antbirds it may simply be a way to deal with the distasteful substances in prey items.<ref name = "HBW"/>

=== Feeding ===

[[File:Thamnophilus caerulescens gleaning.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Variable Antshrike]] gleaning insects from foliage]]
The main component of the diet of all antbirds is [[arthropod]]s.<ref name = "HBW"/> These are mostly insects, including grasshoppers and crickets, cockroaches, praying mantises, stick insects and the larvae of butterflies and moths. In addition antbirds often take spiders, scorpions and centipedes. They swallow smaller prey items quickly, whereas they often beat larger items against branches in order to remove wings and spines. Larger species can kill and consume [[frog]]s and [[lizard]]s as well, but generally these do not form an important part of the diet of this family.<ref name=Lopes/> Other food items may also be eaten, including fruit, eggs and slugs.<ref name = "HBW"/>

The family uses a number of techniques to obtain prey. The majority of antbirds are [[arboreal locomotion|arboreal]], with most of those feeding in the [[understory]], many in the middle story and some in the [[canopy (forest)|canopy]]. A few species feed in the [[plant litter|leaf litter]]; for example, the [[Wing-banded Antbird]] forages in areas of dense leaf-litter. It does not use its feet to scratch the leaf litter, as do some other birds; instead it uses its long bill to turn over leaves rapidly (never picking them up).<ref name=Tostain/> The antbirds that forage arboreally show a number of techniques and specialisations. Some species [[Gleaning (birds)|perch-glean]], perching on a branch watching for prey and snatching it by reaching forward, where others [[Hawking (birds)|sally]] from a perch and snatch prey on the wing.<ref name = "Schulenberg"/> In both cases birds will hop through the foliage or undergrowth and pause, scanning for prey, before pouncing or moving on. The time paused varies, although smaller species tend to be more active and pause for shorter times.<ref name = "HBW"/>

==== Mixed-species feeding flocks ====

[[File:Dotted winged antwren (Drake Bay).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Black-hooded Antshrike]] is a relatively sluggish species usually found singly or in pairs. Here a male feeds on a caterpillar.<!-- originally misidentified as a Dot-winged Antwren, hence the misleading file-name -->|upright]]
Many species participate in [[mixed-species foraging flock|mixed-species feeding flock]]s,<ref name = "HBW"/> forming a large percentage of the participating species within their range. Some of these are core or "nuclear species". These nuclear species share territories with other nuclear species but exclude [[conspecificity|conspecific]]s (members of the same species) and are found in almost all flocks; these are joined by "attendant species". Loud and distinctive [[Bird vocalization|calls]] and conspicuous [[plumage]] are important attributes of nuclear species as they promote cohesion in the flock. The composition of these flocks varies geographically; in Amazonia species of ''[[Thamnomanes]]'' antshrike are the leading nuclear species;<ref name = "Munn"/> elsewhere other species, such as the [[Dot-winged Antwren]]s and [[Checker-throated Antwren]]s, fill this role.<ref name = "HBW"/> Other species of antwren and antbird join them along with [[woodcreeper]]s, [[Habia (bird)|ant-tanagers]], [[Ovenbird (family)|foliage-gleaner]]s and [[hylophilus|greenlet]]s.<ref name = "Munn"/> The benefits of the mixed flock are thought to be related to [[predation]], since many eyes are better for spotting predatory hawks and falcons. Comparisons between multi-species feeding flocks in different parts of the world found that instances of flocking were positively correlated with predation risk by raptors.<ref name = "Thiollay"/> For example, where ''Thamnomanes'' antshrikes lead the group they give loud warning calls in the presence of predators. These calls are understood and reacted to by all the other species in the flock. The advantage to the ''Thamnomanes'' antshrikes is in allowing the rest of the flock, which are typically gleaners, to act as beaters, flushing prey while foraging which the antshrikes can obtain by sallying. Similar roles are filled in other flocks by other antbird species or other bird families, for example the [[Lanio|shrike-tanager]]s.<ref name = "HBW"/> Within the feeding flocks [[Competition (biology)|competition]] is reduced by [[Niche differentiation|microniche partitioning]]; where Dot-winged Antwrens, Checker-throated Antwrens and [[White-flanked Antwren]]s feed in flocks together, the Dot-wings feed in the densest vines, the White-flank in less dense vegetation, and the Checker-throats in the same density as the latter but in dead foliage only.<ref name ="antwren coop"/>

==== Ant followers ====

[[File:Myrmeciza-immaculata-001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Immaculate Antbird]]s regularly attend army ant swarms in order to feed, but they are not obligate ant-followers; they also forage away from the swarms.]]
Swarms of [[Ecitoninae|army ant]]s are an important resource used by some species of antbird, and the one from which the family's common name is derived. Many species of tropical [[ant]] form large raiding swarms, but the swarms are often [[nocturnality|nocturnal]] or raid underground. While birds visit these swarms when they occur, the species most commonly attended by birds is the [[Neotropic ecozone|Neotropical]] species ''[[Eciton burchellii]]'',<ref name = "Willis"/> which is both [[diurnality|diurnal]] and surface-raiding. It was once thought that attending birds were actually eating the ants, but numerous studies in various parts of ''Eciton burchellii's'' range has shown that the ants act as beaters, flushing insects, other arthropods and small vertebrates into the waiting flocks of "ant followers". The improvement in foraging efficiency can be dramatic; a study of [[Spotted Antbird]]s found that they made attempts at prey every 111.8 seconds away from ants, but at swarms they made attempts every 32.3 seconds.<ref name = "Spotted">Willis, E. O. (1972) [http://sora.unm.edu/node/137 "The Behavior of Spotted Antbirds. " (PDF)] ''Ornithological Monographs'' '''10''' 103</ref> While many species of antbirds (and other families) may opportunistically feed at army ant swarms, 18 species of antbird are obligate ant-followers, obtaining most of their diet from swarms.<ref name = "HBW"/> With only three exceptions, these species never regularly forage away from ant swarms. A further four species regularly attend swarms but are as often seen away from them. Obligate ant-followers visit the nesting bivouacs of army ants in the morning to check for raiding activities; other species do not.<ref name=Swartz/> These species tend to arrive at swarms first, and their [[bird vocalization|calls]] are used by other species to locate swarming ants.<ref name = "calls"/>

Because army ants are unpredictable in their movements, it is impractical for obligate ant-followers to maintain a [[Territory (animal)|territory]] that always contains swarms to feed around.<ref name = "HBW"/> Antbirds have [[evolution|evolved]] a more complicated system than the strict territoriality of most other birds. They generally (details vary among species) maintain breeding territories but travel outside those territories in order to feed at swarms. Several pairs of the same species may attend a swarm, with the dominant pair at the swarm being the pair which holds the territory that the swarm is in. In addition to competition within species, competition among species exists, and larger species are dominant. In its range, the [[Ocellated Antbird]] is the largest of the obligate ant-following antbirds and is dominant over other members of the family, although it is subordinate to various species from other families (including certain [[woodcreeper]]s, [[motmot]]s and the [[Rufous-vented Ground Cuckoo]]). At a swarm, the dominant species occupies positions above the central front of the swarm, which yields the largest amount of prey. Smaller, less dominant species locate themselves further away from the centre, or higher above the location of the dominant species, where prey is less plentiful.<ref name = "Willis"/>

=== Breeding ===

Antbirds are [[monogamy|monogamous]], in almost all cases forming [[pair bond]]s that last the life of the pair.<ref name = "HBW"/>  Studies of the [[Dusky Antbird]] and the [[White-bellied Antbird]] did not find "infidelity".<ref name=Fedy/> In the [[White-plumed Antbird]] divorces between pairs are common, but, as far as known, this species is exceptional. In most species the pair defends a classic [[Territory (animal)|territory]], although the nesting territories of ant followers are slightly different (see [[Antbird#Ant followers|feeding]] above). Territories vary in size from as small as 0.5 ha for the [[Manu Antbird]], to 1500&nbsp; m (5000&nbsp;ft) in diameter for the Ocellated Antbird. Ocellated Antbirds have an unusual social system where the breeding pair forms the nucleus of a group or clan that includes their male offspring and their mates. These clans, which can number up to eight birds, work together to defend territories against rivals. Pair bonds are formed with [[courtship feeding]], where the male presents food items to the female.<ref name = "HBW"/> In Spotted Antbirds males may actually feed females sufficiently for the female to cease feeding herself, although she will resume feeding once copulation has occurred.<ref name = "Spotted"/> Mutual grooming also plays a role in courtship in some species.<ref name=Willis2/>
[[File:Phaenostictus-mcleannani-001.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Ocellated Antbird]] has an unusual social system of shared breeding territories. One dominant pair may share a territory with up to six other birds. ]]

The nesting and breeding biology of antbirds have not been well studied. Even in relatively well-known species the breeding behaviour can be poorly known; for example the nest of the [[Ocellated Antbird]] was first described in 2004.<ref name=Buehler/> [[bird nest|Nests]] are constructed by both parents, although the male undertakes more of the work in some species. Antbird nests are cups of vegetation such as twigs, dead leaves and plant fibre, and they follow two basic patterns: either suspended or supported.<ref name = "HBW"/> Suspended cups, which may hang from forks in branches, or between two branches, are the more common style of nest. Supported nests rest upon branches, amongst vines, in hollows, and sometimes on mounds of vegetation on the ground. Each species nests at the level where it forages, so a midstory species would build its nest in the midstory. Closely related species nest in the same ways. For example antvireos in the genus ''[[Dysithamnus]]'' are all suspension nesters.<ref name=Greeney/>

[[File:Female Thamnophilus caerulescens constructing nest.jpg|thumb|A female [[Variable Antshrike]] constructing a nest]]
Almost all antbirds lay two eggs.<ref name = "HBW"/> A few species of antshrike lay three eggs, and a smaller number of antbirds lay one egg, but this is unusual. Small clutch sizes are typical of tropical birds compared to more temperate species of the same size, possibly due to nest predation, although this is disputed.<ref name=Roper/> Both parents participate in [[avian incubation|incubation]], although only the female incubates at night. The length of time taken for chicks to hatch is 14<U+2013>16 days in most species, although some, such as the [[Dusky Antbird]], can take as long as 20 days. The [[altricial]] chicks are born naked and blind. Both parents brood the young until they are able to [[thermoregulation|thermoregulate]], although, as with incubation, only the female broods at night.<ref name = "HBW"/> In common with many songbirds, the parents take faecal sacs for disposal away from the nest. Both parents feed the chicks, often bringing large prey items. When the chicks reach [[fledge|fledging]] age, after 8<U+2013>15 days, attending parents call their chicks. As each chick leaves the nest it is cared for exclusively from then on by the parent that was present then. After the first chick fledges and leaves with a parent the remaining parent may increase the supply of food to speed up the process of fledging. After fledging, chicks spend the first few days well hidden as the parents bring them food. Chicks of some species may not become independent of the parents for as long as four months in some antwrens, but two months is more typical for the rest of the family.

== Ecology ==

Antbirds are common components of the avifauna of some parts of the Neotropics and are thought to be important in some [[ecology|ecological processes]]. They are preyed upon by [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], and their tendency to join flocks is thought to provide protection against such predation.<ref name = "Thiollay"/> The [[greater round-eared bat]] preys on some antbird species, such as the [[White-bibbed Antbird]] and the [[Scaled Antbird]]; the latter is the bat's preferred prey.<ref name=Martuscelli/> Nests, including incubating adults, chicks and eggs, are vulnerable to predators, particularly [[snake]]s but also [[nocturnality|nocturnal mammals]].<ref name = "HBW"/> Nesting success is low for many species, particularly in areas of fragmented habitat.<ref name = "HBW"/><ref name = "Loiselle"/>

It was once suggested that the relationship between the obligate and regular ant-followers and the army ants, particularly ''Eciton burchellii'', was [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]], with the ants benefiting by having the birds chase prey back down towards them. However, experiments where ant followers were excluded have shown that the foraging success of the army ants was 30% lower when the birds were present, suggesting that the birds' relationship was in fact [[parasitism|parasitic]].<ref name=Wrege/> This has resulted in a number of behaviours by the ants in order to reduce [[kleptoparasitism]], including hiding of secured prey in the leaf litter and caching of food on trails. It has been suggested that the depressive effect of this parasitism slows the development of ''E. burchellii'' swarms and in turn benefits other ant species which are preyed upon by army ants. The ant-following antbirds are themselves followed by three species of [[butterfly]] in the family [[Ithomiini|Ithomiinae]] which feed on their [[guano|droppings]].<ref name=Ray/> Bird droppings are usually an unpredictable resource in a rainforest, but the regular behaviour of ant followers makes the exploitation of this resource possible.

== Status and conservation ==

[[File:Pectoral Antwren.jpg|thumb|The [[Pectoral Antwren]] of Brazil is threatened by the loss of deciduous forest and is listed as [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]].]]
As of April 2008, 38 species are considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] to be [[near Threatened|near threatened]] or worse and therefore at risk of [[extinction]].<ref>[[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] (2007). [http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/search.php?freetext=Thamnophilidae&modifier=phrase&criteria=wholedb&terrestrial=1&taxa_species=1&redlistCategory%5B%5D=allex&country%5B%5D=all&cty_default=1&aquatic%5B%5D=all&aqu_default=1&regions%5B%5D=all&reg_default=1&habitats%5B%5D=all&threats%5B%5D=all&redlistAssessyear%5B%5D=all&growths%5B%5D=all 2007 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species: Thamnophilidae]. Downloaded on 23 April 2008.</ref> Antbirds are neither targeted by the pet trade nor large enough to be hunted; the principal cause of the decline in antbird species is [[habitat destruction|habitat loss]].<ref name = "HBW"/> The destruction or modification of forests has several effects on different species of antbirds. The fragmentation of forests into smaller patches affects species that are averse to crossing gaps as small as roads. If these species become locally extinct in a fragment, this reluctance to cross unforested barriers makes their re-establishment unlikely. Smaller forest fragments are unable to sustain mixed-species feeding flocks, leading to local extinctions.<ref name=Stouffer/> Another risk faced by antbirds in fragmented habitat is increased [[bird nest|nest]] predation. An unplanned experiment in fragmentation occurred on [[Barro Colorado Island]], a former hill in [[Panama]] that became an isolated island during the flooding caused by the creation of the [[Panama Canal]]. Numerous species of antbird formerly resident in the area were [[local extinction|extirpated]], in no small part due to increased levels of nest predation on the island.<ref name=Sieving/> While the species lost from Barro Colorado are not globally threatened, they illustrate the vulnerability of species in fragmented habitats and help explain the declines of some species. The majority of threatened species have very small natural ranges.<ref name = "HBW"/> Some are also extremely poorly known; for example the [[Rio de Janeiro Antwren]] is known only from a single [[Biological specimen|specimen]] collected in 1982, although there have been unconfirmed reports since 1994 and it is currently listed as [[critically Endangered|critically endangered]].<ref>[[BirdLife International]] (2007) [http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=4658&m=0 Species factsheet: ''Myrmotherula fluminensis''.] Accessed on 26 April 2008</ref> Additionally, new species are discovered at regular intervals; the [[Caatinga Antwren]] was described in 2000, the [[Acre Antshrike]] in 2004, the [[Sincor<U+00E1> Antwren]] in 2007, and the description of a relative of the [[Marsh Antwren|Paran<U+00E1> Antwren]] discovered in 2005 in the outskirts of [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] is being prepared.<ref name=notes/> While not yet scientifically described, conservation efforts have already been necessary, as the site of discovery was set out to be flooded to form a reservoir. Consequently, 72 individuals were captured and transferred to another locality.<ref>[http://www.universia.com.br/html/noticia/noticia_dentrodocampus_bjhbh.html {{Pt icon}} ''Nova esp<U+00E9>cie de p<U+00E1>ssaro <U+00E9> descoberta em S<U+00E3>o Paulo.
