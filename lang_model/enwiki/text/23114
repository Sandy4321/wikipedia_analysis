'''Moss '''('''Maurice''')''' Twomey''' (10 June 1897 &ndash; October 1978) was an [[Irish Republicanism|Irish republican]] and [[List of IRA Chiefs of Staff|chief of staff]] of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA).

==Early life==

Twomey was born in 1897 in [[Clondulane]], near [[Fermoy]], [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]] and was educated by the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]].<ref name=UCDArchives>{{cite web|title=TWOMEY, MAURICE (<U+2018>MOSS<U+2019>)|url=http://www.ucd.ie/archives/html/collections/twoomey-moss.htm|publisher=UCD Archives|accessdate=11-09-2012}}</ref> 

The son of a [[labourer]] at Hallinan<U+2019>s [[Flour mill|Flour Mills]] in the town, Twomey went to work there at the age of 14 where he rose to the position of works manager. In 1914 he became active in the [[Irish Volunteers]].<ref name=UCDArchives />

==War of Independence==

By 1918 he was [[adjutant]] of the Fermoy Battalion and a year later became an adjutant of the Cork No. 2 Brigade. He took part in an ambush of [[British Army|British troops]] in Fermoy in September 1919, one of the first attacks on British soldiers in Ireland since the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] and one of the first of the [[Irish War of Independence]]. 

During 1920 he helped direct IRA [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] in his brigade area. He was staff commandant of [[Liam Lynch (general)|Liam Lynch<U+2019>s]] 1st Southern Division when he was captured and imprisoned on [[Spike Island, County Cork|Spike Island]] during 1921. He managed to escape from the prison by row boat along with [[Richard Barrett (Irish Republican)|Dick Barrett]], Tom Crofts and Bill Quirke.

==Civil War==

Twomey opposed the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of December 1921, although he was critical of the tactics adopted by the anti-Treaty forces headquartered in the [[Four Courts]], [[Dublin]] during June 1922. During the [[Irish Civil War]], he became adjutant general on Liam Lynch<U+2019>s staff and was with Lynch when he was killed on the Knockmealdowns mountains in April 1923. Twomey was [[imprisoned]] in the same month in Dublin.

==IRA Chief of Staff==

During 1924 he became involved in the reorganisation of the IRA, inspecting its southern divisions that summer and its northern units during 1925. First elected onto the [[IRA Executive]] at the November 1925 [[IRA General Army Convention]], he became a full-time IRA activist although described his profession as <U+201C>[[journalist]]<U+201D>, justified somewhat by his regular contributions to the IRA weekly [[newspaper]], ''[[An Phoblacht]]''. During ''1926'' he was acting [[List of IRA Chiefs of Staff|IRA chief of staff]] in the absence of [[Andy Cooney]], and in 1927, he was confirmed in that position. 

In 1930, Twomey married Kathleen MacLaughlin of [[Donegal]] and had two children in the early 1930s. The same year he made a secret visit to the [[USA]].

Under his leadership the IRA supported the [[Fianna F<U+00E1>il]] government against the [[Blueshirts]] during 1932-1933.

On 18 June 1936, the Fianna F<U+00E1>il government banned the IRA. The following day Twomey was tried and jailed for three years for membership of the newly proscribed organisation. Under the IRA constitution, his tenure as IRA chief of staff ended automatically upon his arrest. He was imprisoned in the [[Curragh]] from 1936 to 1938. During his period of imprisonment his family depended heavily on money sent to them by [[Joseph McGarrity]] of [[Clan na Gael]], a US-based IRA [[fundraising]] organisation. On his release, Twomey became [[adjutant general]] on [[Se<U+00E1>n Russell]]'s [[IRA army council|army council]]. He travelled to [[UK|Britain]] and inspected the IRA's units there. Twomey concluded that the IRA was in no position to launch a campaign and withdrew from IRA activity. In 1939 he opened a [[newsagents]] and [[confectioners]] in Dublin's [[O'Connell Street]].

==Post IRA life==

Following a crackdown on the IRA by [[<U+00C9>amon de Valera]]'s government, he was [[interned]] for two weeks during 1940. He remained close to the IRA, giving assistance to republicans deported from Britain and mediating in disputes between IRA factions. While he did not take an active role in politics after the 1940s, he did speak at a number of republican [[commemorations]], most notably at the restoration of [[Wolfe Tone|Wolfe Tone's]] grave at [[Bodenstown]] in 1971. He never claimed an IRA pension from the Irish government or gave an account of his record to the [[Bureau of Military History]], set up to record the recollections of participants involved in the struggle against British rule. 

He was badly injured in an accident in 1971 and was deeply affected by the death of his wife in April 1978. Twomey himself died in October of that year. The presence at his funeral of members of [[Fianna F<U+00E1>il]] and [[Fine Gael]], [[Official Sinn F<U+00E9>in|Sinn F<U+00E9>in The Workers<U+2019> Party]] and [[Provisional Sinn F<U+00E9>in]], the Irish [[labour movement]] and old IRA comrades from the 1930s was evidence of his enduring popularity.
