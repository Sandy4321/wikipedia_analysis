In late [[1999 in film|1999]], Timberlake made his acting debut in the [[Disney Channel]] movie ''[[Model Behavior]]''. He played Jason Sharpe, a model who falls in love with a waitress after mistaking her for another model.

As a member of 'N Sync, Timberlake developed into a major celebrity in his own right in addition to achieving respect as a musician, since he was the writer or co-writer of all three singles from ''Celebrity''. The rise of his own stardom and the general decline in the popularity of boy bands led to the dissolution of 'N Sync. Band member [[Lance Bass]] has stated that he believes the group is finished,<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-22|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/orl-bass2307oct23,0,2291743,print.story?coll=orl_mezz

===Relationships===
Early in 1999, Timberlake began what eventually became a high-profile celebrity relationship with fellow pop singer [[Britney Spears]], with whom he had worked on the ''[[Mickey Mouse Club|New Mickey Mouse Club]]''. This ended abruptly in March 2002. Lynn Harless says as a mother she too was devastated regarding the break-up, but to this day speaks warmly of Spears, "Britney grew up on my living room floor. I still love her to death. They (Justin and Britney) were together 10 or 11 years and had, from day one, instant chemistry between them. She's a sweet girl. I just hate what she's going through now." The breakup influenced the lyrics and theme of Timberlake's hit "[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]", one of the most popular singles from ''Justified''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Justin: The Unauthorized Biography|author=Smith, Sean|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|date=2005-10-04|isbn=1-4165-0773-6}}</ref>

Post-Spears, Timberlake has generally refused to discuss his personal life with the media, as a result of which his relationships have been the subject of much speculation in the tabloid and celebrity press. Prior to Spears, he was briefly romantically involved with [[Beyonce Knowles]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pattygopez-justintimberlakefwb.buzznet.com/user/photos/justin-timberlake-beyonce/?id=66202311 |title=Justin Timberlake's Dirty Dozen 'Friends With Benefits' |publisher=Patty Gopez |date=2011-07-20}}</ref> and singer-actress [[Fergie (singer)|Stacy Ferguson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/68195/give-peas-chance.html |title=Give Peas A Chance |publisher=Blender |date= |accessdate=2010-01-02}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> He was romantically linked with [[Janet Jackson]] (in July 2002),<ref name="solo">{{cite news|accessdate=2008-04-22|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=101205&page=1|title=Justin Timberlake dating Janet Jackson? |publisher=ABC News |date=2002-07-12}}</ref> actress-dancer [[Jenna Dewan]] (in mid-2002),<ref name="solo">{{cite news|accessdate=2008-04-22|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/04/people.cel.timberlake/index.html|title=Justin Timberlake flies solo |publisher=CNN | date=2002-11-04}}</ref> and actress-singer [[Alyssa Milano]] (between September and October 2002).<ref name="solo" /> Timberlake began dating actress [[Cameron Diaz]] soon after they met at the [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]] in April 2003.
