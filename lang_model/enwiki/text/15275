The '''Sioux Uprising''', also known as the '''Dakota Conflict''' or the '''U.S.-Dakota War of 1862''', was an armed conflict between the [[United States]] and several eastern bands of the [[Lakota|Dakota people]] (often referred to as the Santee Sioux) that began on [[August 17]], [[1862]], along the [[Minnesota River]] in southwest [[Minnesota]].  Skirmishes in the following weeks claimed hundreds of lives.  The number of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] dead is unknown, while estimates of settlers who died range between 300 and 800&mdash;one of the largest tolls on American [[civilian]]s to ever occur.  The conflict also resulted in the largest mass [[capital punishment|execution]] in U.S. history, when 38 Dakota men, convicted of [[murder]] and [[rape]], were [[hanging|hanged]] in [[Mankato, Minnesota]].  This was the first major armed engagement between the U.S. and Dakota, though it would not be the last.

==Background==
In 1851, the U.S. and Dakota leaders negotiated the [[Treaty of Traverse des Sioux]] and [[Treaty of Mendota]], ceding vast amounts of land in [[Minnesota Territory]].  In exchange for [[money]] and [[Good (accounting)|goods]], the Dakota agreed to live on a twenty [[mile]] (32 [[kilometer|km]]) wide [[Indian reservation|reservation]] centered on a 150 mile (240 km) stretch of the upper Minnesota River.  The deal immediately began to turn sour as the [[United States Senate]] deleted Article 3 of each treaty during the [[ratification]] process.  Much of the promised compensation never arrived, lost or effectively stolen due to corruption in the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and wrongful conduct by [[trading|trader]]s.

As [[Minnesota]] became a state in 1858, representatives of several Dakota bands led by Chief [[Taoyateduta]] (commonly known as [[Chief Little Crow]]) traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]], to make further negotiations.  Again, events did not transpire in the Indians' favor.  The northern half of the reservation along the [[Minnesota River]] was lost, and rights to the [[quarry]] at [[Pipestone, Minnesota]], were also ceded.  This was a major blow to the standing of Little Crow in the Dakota community.

In the meantime, the ceded land was quickly being divided up into [[township (United States)|townships]] and individual plots for settlement.  The [[forest]], [[prairie]], and other wild lands used in the traditional Dakota yearly cycle of [[farm]]ing, [[hunting]], [[fishing]], and gathering [[wild rice]] was unalterably interrupted as [[timber]] was stripped to make way for new farms plowed by white settlers.  In addition, wild game like [[American bison|bison]], [[Elk (Cervus canadensis)|elk]], [[whitetail deer]], and [[bear]] had been hunted so intensively that populations were tiny compared to the populations before Euro-American settlement.  The Dakota people of southern and western Minnesota relied on the sale of valuable furs to American traders to earn cash needed to buy necessities.

Payments guaranteed by the treaties were not made, due to Federal preoccupation with the [[American Civil War]].  Most land in the river valley was not arable, and hunting could no longer support the Dakota community.  Losing land to new white settlers, non-payment, past broken treaties, plus food shortages and [[famine]] following crop failure led to great discontent among the Dakota people.  Tension increased through the summer of 1862.

On [[August 4]], representatives of the northern [[Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe|Sisseton and Wahpeton bands]] met at the [[Upper Sioux Agency]] in the northwestern part of the reservation.  They successfully negotiated to obtain food.  However, when the southern [[Mdewakanton]] and [[Wahpekute]] Dakota turned to the [[Lower Sioux Agency]] for supplies on [[August 15]], they were rejected.  Indian Agent (and [[Minnesota State Senate|Minnesota State Senator]]) [[Thomas J. Galbraith|Thomas Galbraith]] managed the area and would not distribute food without payment.  At a meeting arranged between the Indians, the government, and local traders, the Dakota asked lead trader [[Andrew Myrick]] to support their cause.  His response was blunt. "So far as I'm concerned, if they are hungry, let them eat grass or their own dung."

The dehumanizing comment first brought a hush over the group, but they soon began yelling at him.  Soon after, with the Civil War keeping the U.S. occupied, some Dakota warriors saw an opportunity.  The delayed money for the tribes arrived in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] to the east on [[August 16]], arriving at [[Fort Ridgely]] the next day.  However, it came too late to prevent violence from erupting.

==First events==

While a fight had broken out in [[Spirit Lake, Iowa]], (the "[[Spirit Lake Massacre]]") in 1857, most accounts trace the beginning of the Dakota Conflict to the killing of five whites by four young Dakota men on Sunday, [[August 17]], [[1862]].  The Dakotas had been hunting, but ended up stealing food from the settlement of [[Acton Township, Minnesota|Acton]] in [[Meeker County, Minnesota|Meeker County]] (near present day [[Grove City, Minnesota|Grove City]]). Soon, they had killed several of the settlers, including women. This event caused an uproar among the Santee Sioux living on the reservation, and some warriors convinced a reluctant Chief Little Crow to lead further attacks.

==The conflict==

===Hostilities in South Central Minnesota===
On [[August 18]], Chief Little Crow led a group that attacked numerous white settlers at the Lower Sioux Agency.  Trader Andrew Myrick was among the first that was killed.  He was discovered trying to escape through a second-floor window.  Days later, Myrick's body was found&mdash;with grass stuffed into his mouth.  The stores were taken and several buildings at the site were torched, though this provided enough delay for many people to escape across the river at Redwood Ferry.  An initial Minnesota militia force that was sent to suppress the uprising only resulted in a massacre of Minnesota troops in the [[Battle of Redwood Ferry]].  At least 44 deaths occurred that day.{Note: 24 soldiers killed/5 wounded & 16 also survived}

Confident with their initial success, the Sioux would continue on their rampage, attacking the white settlement of [[New Ulm, Minnesota|New Ulm]] on [[August 19]].  Dakota warriors decided not to attack the heavily-defended Fort Ridgely along the river, instead turning toward the town and killing many white settlers along the way.  By the time New Ulm was attacked, residents had organized defenses in the town center and kept the Dakota at bay.

The military compound Fort Ridgely was later [[Battle of Fort Ridgely|attacked]] on [[August 22]].  White settlers sustained fairly heavy casualties in both cases. {Soldiers: 3 killed/13 wounded. Lakota 2 known dead[[http://www.isd77.k12.mn.us/schools/dakota/conflict/ftrid.htm]]} 

In the meantime, there were also raids on farms and small settlements throughout the south central part of Minnesota and eastern Dakota Territory.  Initial counter-rattacks by Minnesota troops resulted in another massacre of white soldiers at [[Birch Coulee]] on [[September 2]].

The [[Battle of Birch Coulee]] began when a large group of Dakota attacked a detachment of 150 U.S. soldiers at Birch Coulee, 16 miles from Fort Ridgely. The detachment had been sent out to find survivors, bury the dead, and report on the location of Dakota fighters. A three-hour firefight began with an early morning assault. Twenty soldiers were killed and 60 wounded. There are no accounts of Dakota casualties. {Note: the following gives casualites as Soldiers 13 killed/47 wounded; Lakota 2 killed. [[http://www.isd77.k12.mn.us/schools/dakota/conflict/birco.htm]]}. A column of 240 soldiers from Fort Ridgely relieved the detachment at Birch Coulee that afternoon. Fort Ridgeley was defended by Companies "B" & "C" of the 5th Minnesota Infantry August 20-22, 1862


===Hostilities in Northwestern Minnesota===
Farther north, the Sioux attacked several unfortified stage stops and river crossings along the the white trash settler trade route between [[Fort Garry]] and [[St. Paul]] in the [[Red River Valley]] in northwestern Minnesota and eastern Dakota Territory.  Many settlers and employees of the [[Hudson Bay Company]] and other local enterprises in this sparsely populated country took refuge in a prairie "fort" known as [[Fort Abercrombie]], located in a bend of the [[Red River]] about 25 miles south of present day [[Fargo, North Dakota]]. Over a period of six weeks, the Indians launched several attacks on [[Fort Abercrombie]] which were repelled by the white defenders and which came to be known as the "Siege at Fort Abercrombie".  Steamship and flatboat trade on the [[Red River]] came to a halt, and mail carriers, stage drivers and military couriers attempting to reach the [[Pembina]] and [[Fort Garry]] settlements and [[St. Cloud]] and [[Fort Snelling]] were killed by the Indians.  Eventually the garrison at Fort Abercrombie was relieved by a United States Army company from [[Fort Snelling]] and the civilian refugees were removed to [[St. Cloud]].

The [[Chippewa]] or [[Ojibwa]] Indian bands from [[Pembina]] and [[Red Lake]] were awaiting a treaty goods shipment for a contemplated land cession of 1862 along a ford of the Red River near the junction with the [[Red Lake River]] near present day [[Grand Forks]].  The shipment never arrived, and the treaty negotiations were postponed until 1863, when the [[Treaty of Old Crossing (1863)]] was consummated near [[Huot, Minnesota]], a ford of the [[Red Lake River]] utilized by oxen-drawn [[Red River carts]]. The Ojibwe at times were accused of complicity or direct involvement in the attacks, but no evidence exists that any of the depradations and atrocities associated with the conflict between Indians and white and half-breed settlers of 1862 were perpetrated by anyone other than the various bands of the Sioux Indians. [3]

===Continued Developments in the South===

Due to the Civil War, repeated appeals for help were required before [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] appointed General [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] to assemble troops from the [[3rd Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment|Third]] and [[4th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment|Fourth Minnesota Regiment]]s to quell the violence.  [[Governor of Minnesota|Minnesota Governor]] [[Alexander Ramsey]] also instructed Colonel [[Henry Hastings Sibley|Henry Sibley]] (formerly the state's first governor) to aid in the effort.  Although the expedition got off to a slow start, the Sioux were finally met and defeated at the [[Wood Lake, Minnesota|Wood Lake]] on [[September 23]], [[1862]].

The fighting lasted for six weeks. The final large-scale fighting took place in the [[Battle of Wood Lake]] on [[Sept 23]] [[1862]]. According to the [[Official Reports|Official  Report]] of Lt. Col. William R. Marshall of the [[7th Minnesota Infantry|7th Minnesota Volunteers]] (with five companies of the 7th Minn&mdash;A, B, F, G, and H, a 6 pounder gun and a company of the [[6th Minnesota Infantry]]) had half his men in rifle pits and the others were in a skirmish line which then charged on a ravine occupied by Indians. The 7th lost 1 man killed; 3 wounded/injured while Indian casualties amounted to 7 killed.<ref> According to the "Official Records of the War of the Rebellion," Volume 18 Chapter 25, pp. 280&ndash;81. Another source gives the totals as Soldiers 7 killed/34 wounded. Lakota: 14 killed [[http://www.isd77.k12.mn.us/schools/dakota/wood_l.htm]]</ref>

Some Dakota fighters surrendered at [[Camp Release]] on [[September 26]].  The place was so-named because it was the site where 269 captives of the Dakota were released to the troops commanded by Col. Henry Sibley. The captives included 162 mixed-bloods and 107 whites, mostly women and children. Most of the Dakotas guilty of [[war crimes]] left before Sibley arrived at Camp Release.<ref>Schultz, p249.</ref> 

Records conclusively show that more than 500 soldiers and settlers died in the conflict, though many more may are believed to have died in small raids or after being captured.  Estimates for U.S. losses range up to 800, though there is no accurate accounting of Dakota deaths.

==Trials and mass execution==
[[Image:MankatoMN38.JPG|thumb|350px|left|Mass hanging in [[Mankato, Minnesota]]. A drawing of the mass hanging was long a familiar icon in Minnesota.]]

Initially, 303 Sioux prisoners were convicted of murder and rape by [[military tribunal]]s and sentenced to death six weeks later. Some trials lasted less than 5 minutes, and the Dakotas had no one to explain the proceedings to them or to represent them.  President Lincoln reviewed the trial records and distinguished between those who had engaged in warfare against the United States and those who had committed the crimes of rape or murder of civilians. He approved of the execution of 39 of the latter, and commuted the death sentences of the others, largely due to the pleas from [[Henry Benjamin Whipple|Bishop Henry Whipple]] for clemency. <ref>Schultz, pp. 252-259</ref>.  The 38, for whom the evidence seemed strongest, were executed by hanging in a single day on [[December 26]], [[1862]], in Mankato.

The mass execution was performed for all to see from a single scaffold platform.  It was, and still is, the largest execution in the history of the United States. [[Chief Cut Nose]] was convicted of being involved in the attack on [[New Ulm, Minnesota]], and he was one of the thirty-eight hanged. The bodies of the Indians were pronounced dead by the regimental surgeons and then they were buried in a long trench, which was dug in the sand of the riverbank.  Before they were buried, however, a <U+201C>Dr. Sheardown<U+201D> supposedly removed some of the Indians<U+2019> skin. Little boxes containing the skin were sold in Mankato after the hangings.  Over the years, many <U+201C>souvenir<U+201D> pieces of skin have continued to be sold, some on [[eBay]].  Of course, most are hoaxes and are just hunks of pigskin. 

At that time, bodies used for dissection by medical men were hard to come by, so some of the many medical men attending the hanging asked for the bodies.  One of those men was Doctor [[William Worrall Mayo]].  The mass grave was re-opened and the bodies were removed and distributed.  As fate would have it, Dr. Mayo received Cut Nose, the brave he had encountered earlier in their lives, and stood up to.  Dr. Mayo brought Cut Nose<U+2019>s body back to [[Le Sueur, Minnesota|Le Sueur]].  There, Mayo dissected it in the presence of some medical colleagues.  Afterwards, the skeleton was cleaned, dried and varnished so other students could benefit from it.

The remaining convicted Indians stayed in prison that winter.  The following spring, they were transferred to [[Rock Island, Illinois]] (near [[Davenport, Iowa]]) where they were held in a prison for almost four years.  By the time of their release, one third of the Indians had died of disease.  The survivors were sent with their families to [[Nebraska]].  Almost five hundred white men, women and children were killed in the uprising in Minnesota.  Some figures go as high as nine hundred. 
<!--[[[[User:Torshaw|Torshaw]] 22:58, 1 March 2006 (UTC)}}-->

The 38 men who were hanged are remembered each year at two separate [[pow-wow]]s in the state. The Mankato pow-wow, held each year in September, commemorates the lives of the condemned men, but also seeks to reconcile the white and Indian communities. The Birch Coulee pow-wow, held on [[Labor Day]] weekend, honors the lives of those who were hanged in the largest mass execution in [[United States history]]. There are also several stone statues at the site, in downtown Mankato, where the execution took place.

==Aftermath (Dakota)==
As a result of the war, the U.S. government abolished the reservation, declared all previous treaties with the Dakota null and void, and undertook proceedings to expel the Dakota people entirely from Minnesota.  To this end, a [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] of $25 per scalp was placed on virtually any Dakota found free within the boundaries of the state. The only exceptions to this were a smattering of a few hundred "friendlies" -- groups such as the [[Shakopee-Mdewakanton Indian Reservation|Shakopee Mdewakanton]] and others -- who sat out, or even allied with the whites, in the conflict.

1,300 to 1,700 Dakota people were rounded up and held in a [[concentration camp]] below [[Fort Snelling, Minnesota|Fort Snelling]] in the winter of 1862&ndash;1863. In the spring, the camp was moved southwest toward the current site of the [[Mall of America]], prior to the mass removal of these people to [[Nebraska]] and [[South Dakota]] including the [[Crow Creek Indian Reservation]] on the [[Missouri River]] on [[May 4]], [[1863]].  More than 130 Dakota died in the camp and subsequent removal.

The Minnesota Sioux War of 1862 was the first violent engagement between the Dakota Indians and the United States. It would not be the last, however. The battle of [[Killdeer Mountain]] occurred in 1864, [[Red Cloud's War]] followed in 1866&ndash;1868, and the [[Battle of Little Big Horn]] in 1876 and [[Battle of Wounded Knee]] in 1890 also involved the two parties.

[[Image:GoodThunderandSnana.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander Goodthunder and his wife Snana]]
Taoyateduta was forced to flee from the fighting about a month after the conflict began. He briefly stayed in [[Canada]], but soon returned to the area. He was killed on [[July 3]], [[1863]] near [[Hutchinson, Minnesota]] while gathering raspberries with his teenage son.  The pair had wandered onto the land of white settler Nathan Lamson, who shot at them hoping to collect the bounties. Taoyateduta's skull and scalp were removed from his body, and were set on public display in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], where they so remained until 1971.

Lamson received an additional $500 reward for his efforts; Taoyateduta's son (who was captured in the incident) was at one time condemned to die, but later had that sentence commuted to a prison term.

By the 1880s, a number of Dakota had trickled back to the Minnesota River valley, notably the Goodthunder, Wabasha, Bluestone, and Lawrence families. They were joined by several families from the Wahpekute Dakota who had been living under the protection of Bishop Whipple and the trader [[Alexander Faribault]]. The small [[Lower Sioux Indian Reservation]] was reestablished at the site of the Lower Sioux Agency near [[Morton, Minnesota|Morton]], and in the 1930s an even smaller [[Upper Sioux Indian Reservation|Upper Sioux Reservation]] (little more than a [[square mile]] in size) was established near [[Granite Falls, Minnesota|Granite Falls]].

Many Dakota did not join in the attacks, choosing to aid and protect settlers and to serve with the Minnesota soldiers who responded to the attacks. The Yankton Sioux chief [[Struck by the Ree]] deployed his warriors for this purpose. Monuments to their actions were erected in the 1890s on the river bluff opposite the Lower Sioux Agency. Even so, Struck by the Ree's people were not judged "friendly"  enough to be allowed to remain in the state after the war.

==Aftermath (Euro-American)==
The [[Minnesota River]] Valley and surrounding [[upland]] [[prairie]] areas were largely emptied out as a direct result of the "uprising".  Many of the surviving families who fled their farms and homes as refugees during the weeks and months that followed the initial conflict never returned.  Following the end of the Civil War, however, the area was re-settled by European immigrants and United States migrants, and became a flourishing agricultural region by the 1890s.  By the late 1920s, only a handful of eyewitnesses remained to provide a first-hand account of the "war", and the conflict passed into the realm of history.  Still, the oral and written traditions of the white survivors have a place in the cultural and social history of the era, equal in dignity and deserving of respect to those of the Dakota diaspora.  Such eyewitness accounts were communicated first-hand to individuals who survived into the 1970s and 1980s and in turn passed their visceral remembrances on in the largely rural white Euroamerican farming communities that developed in the region.  Regardless of how historians may judge the causes and excuses for the attacks, the fact that innocent individuals and families of struggling pioneer farmers were killed by marauding bands of Dakota, often in horrific and inhumane ways, has never left the consciousness of the prairie communities of South Central Minnesota.  Numerous local monuments, neither catalogued nor honored by historians of this era, continue the testament to the wilfully slaughtered men, women and children who died at the hands of the natives in the initial salvo of what became a drawn-out 30-year affair now recognized as the final chapter of the [[Indian Wars]].
