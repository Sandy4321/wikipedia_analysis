In [[enzymology]], a '''succinyl-CoA hydrolase''' ({{EC number|3.1.2.3}}) is an [[enzyme]] that [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the [[chemical reaction]]

:succinyl-CoA + H<sub>2</sub>O <math>\rightleftharpoons</math> CoA + succinate

Thus, the two [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] of this enzyme are [[succinyl-CoA]] and [[water|H<sub>2</sub>O]], whereas its two [[product (chemistry)|products]] are [[coenzyme A|CoA]] and [[succinate]].

This enzyme belongs to the family of [[hydrolase]]s, specifically those acting on [[thioester]] bonds.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is '''succinyl-CoA hydrolase'''. Other names in common use include '''succinyl-CoA acylase''', '''succinyl coenzyme A hydrolase''', and '''succinyl coenzyme A deacylase'''.  This enzyme participates in [[citrate cycle (tca cycle)]].
