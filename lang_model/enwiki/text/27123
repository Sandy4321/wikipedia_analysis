The '''Panzerj<U+00E4>ger I''' (''Tank Hunter'') was the first of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[tank destroyer]]s to see service in the [[Second World War]]. It mounted a Czech [[Skoda Works|Skoda]] {{convert|4.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} cm PaK (t) [[anti-tank gun]] on a converted [[Panzer I]] Ausf. B [[chassis]]. It was intended to counter heavy French tanks like the [[Char B1]] that were beyond the capabilities of the [[3.7 cm PaK 36]] then in service and served to extend the usable lifetime of obsolete Panzer I tanks.<ref name=Jentz46>Jentz, p. 46</ref> 202 were converted in 1940<U+2014>41. It served in the West during the [[Battle of France]], in North Africa and on the [[Eastern Front]] until all vehicles were either captured or destroyed.

==Design and production==

The Panzer I's turret was removed and a fixed gunshield added to protect the armament and crew. The anti-tank gun was mounted on a pedestal in the fighting compartment with the wheels, axle and trails removed; it retained its original [[gun shield]].<ref name=Jentz46>Jentz, p. 46</ref> It normally carried 74 anti-tank and 10 [[HE]] shells.<ref>Jentz, p. 61</ref>

202 vehicles were produced in total, 132 in the first series by [[Alkett]] in 1940. Ten of the second series of 70 were assembled by Alkett while the remainder were assembled by Kl<U+00F6>ckner-Humboldt-Deutz in 1940 and 1941. Vehicles of the second series are recognizable by their seven-sided gun shield versus the first series's five-sided shield.<ref>Jentz, pp. 46, 56</ref>

The vehicle's formal name was '''4.7 cm PaK(t) (Sf) auf Panzerkampfwagen I ohne Turm'''.  This translates as '''Self-propelled 4.7 cm Czech Anti-tank Gun Using the Turret-less Pz.Kpfw. I'''.

==Organization==
The ''Panzerj<U+00E4>ger Is'' were generally organized into nine-vehicle companies, with three companies per battalion.<ref name=Jentz46>Jentz, p. 46</ref> For the [[French Campaign]] (only) ''Anti-tank Battalion (Panzerj<U+00E4>ger-Abteilung) 521'' had only six vehicles per company.<ref name=Jentz46>Jentz, p. 46</ref> With two exceptions they were only used by independent anti-tank battalions during the war. However, after the [[Balkan Campaign]], one company was assigned to the ''[[1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|SS-Brigade Liebstandarte der SS Adolf Hitler]]'' and another to ''Panzerj<U+00E4>ger-Abteilung 900'' of ''[[Lehr-Brigade (mot.) 900]] (900th Motorized Demonstration Brigade)'' in preparation for [[Operation Barbarossa]].<ref name=J56>Jentz, p. 56</ref>

==Combat History==
Ninety-nine vehicles equipped ''Anti-tank Battalions 521, 616, 643 and 670'' in [[Battle of France|France]]. Only Anti-tank Battalion 521 participated in the campaign from the beginning as the other three were still training until a few days after the campaign began, but were sent to the front as they finished their training.<ref>Jentz, pp. 46, 52</ref> 

Twenty-seven ''Panzerj<U+00E4>ger Is'' equipped ''Anti-tank Battalion 605'' in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]]. It arrived in [[Tripoli, Libya]] between 18 and 21 March 1941. Five replacements were sent in September 1941, but only three arrived on 2 October as the others had been sunk on board the freighter ''Castellon''. At the start of [[Operation Crusader]] the battalion was at full strength, but lost thirteen vehicles during the battles. Four more replacements were sent in January 1942 so that it mustered seventeen at the beginning of the [[Battle of Gazala]]. Despite the shipment of another three vehicles in September/October 1942 the battalion only had eleven by the beginning of the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]. The last two replacements received by the battalion were in November 1942.<ref name=J6>Jentz, p. 60</ref> 

''Anti-tank Battalions 521, 529, 616, 643 and 670'' were equipped with one hundred thirty-five ''Panzerj<U+00E4>ger Is'' for [[Operation Barbarossa]]. They were assigned as given below for the opening stages of the battle:<ref name=J56>Jentz, p. 56</ref>

By 27 July 1941 ''Anti-tank Battalion 529'' had lost four ''Panzerj<U+00E4>ger Is''. On 23 November 1941 it reported that it still had sixteen vehicles, although two were not operational.<ref name=J8>Jentz, p. 58</ref> Most do not appear to have survived the Winter of 1941/42 as ''Anti-tank Battalion 521'' reported only five on hand on 5 May 1942. ''Anti-tank Battalion 529'' had only two on strength when it was disbanded on 30 June 1942. ''Anti-tank Battalion 616'' seems to have been an exception as it reported all three companies had ''Panzerj<U+00E4>ger Is'' through at least the Autumn of 1942.<ref name=J6>Jentz, p. 60</ref>

==Combat Assessments==
===''Anti-tank Battalion 643'' 25 July 1940=== 
<blockquote>The 4.7 cm armor-piercing shells (Panzergranaten) are very good against {{convert|45|to|50|mm|in}} thick armor at ranges up to {{convert|500|m|yd}} - sufficient to {{convert|600|m|yd}}. Observation is very bad. You have to look over the shield to observe to the front, resulting in head shots (Kopfsch<U+00FC>sse)! In effect the crew are blind when attacking in villages or against street barricades, M.G. nests and individual tanks.<ref>Jentz, p. 54</ref></blockquote>

===''Anti-tank Battalion 521'' July 1941===
<blockquote><p>The effective range of the 4.7 cm Pak(t) is {{convert|1000|to|1200|m|yd}} with a maximum range of {{convert|1500|m|yd}}. When attacking an enemy position equipped with anti-tank guns and artillery, as occurred near [[Mogilev]] and [[Rogachev]], because of its high superstructure that presents a good target for artillery and anti-tank guns, the ''Panzerj<U+00E4>ger'' is destroyed before it can get into action.</p>

<p>When large shells explode close-by, fragments penetrate the thin armor, as occurred near Rogachev. Russian {{convert|4.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} anti-tank guns already penetrate at {{convert|1200|m|yd}} range. The 1. Kompanie lost 5 out of the 10 vehicles (Kampffahrzeugen) in such actions, of which only two could be repaired.<ref name=J8>Jentz, p. 58</ref></p></blockquote>

===''Anti-tank Battalion 605'' July 1942===
<blockquote><p>The good accuracy of this weapon was especially commented on. Usually a hit is obtained with the first shot at ranges up to {{convert|1000|m|yd}}. Penetration ability is too low for the necessary combat ranges in the desert. The chassis is too weak. The engine is overtaxed. Springs in the suspension are continuously breaking.</p>

In one case, three Mk.II ([[Matilda tank|Matilda II infantry tanks]]) were penetrated at a range of {{convert|400|m|yd}} by 4.7 cm [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|tungsten-core armor-piercing shell]] (''Pz.Gr. 40''). It usually penetrates {{convert|60|mm|in}} of armor. Therefore, a small percentage of these rounds are desired. The 4.7 cm armor-piercing shell (Pz.Gr. 36(t)) will not penetrate a Mk.II at {{convert|600|to|800|m|yd}}. But the crew will abandon the tank because fragments [[spall]] off the armor on the inside.</p><ref name=J6>Jentz, p. 60</ref></blockquote>
