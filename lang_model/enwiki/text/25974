'''Washingborough''' is a village {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} east from [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] city centre, in the [[North Kesteven]] district of [[Lincolnshire]], England. It is situated on the lower slopes of [[Lincoln Cliff]] [[limestone]] [[escarpment]] where the [[River Witham]] breaks through the Lincoln Edge.

==Geography==
[[Image:UK Washingborough.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Washingborough signpost]]
Washingborough is the point on the River Witham at which the Lincolnshire [[Fens]] begin. The Fens were first drained by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and the Roman [[Car Dyke]] ran from Washingborough to the [[River Nene]], near [[Peterborough]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} 
==History==
A dig involving [[Channel 4]]'s [[Time Team]] on a site adjacent to the modern, canalised course of the River Witham found evidence of an important late [[iron age]] settlement of around 1000 BC.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} At this time the river was tidal and the evidence suggests{{according to whom?|date=June 2012}} a trading and metal working centre with trading connections to northern Europe. Copper ore and ingots were found as well as evidence of smelting in [[crucible]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The settlement lost importance as water levels rose and the site became unsuitable. Much of the settlement site was destroyed when the river was canalised in the 18th century as part of the effort to drain the [[Fens]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The parish [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/142358 church] is dedicated to St John the Evangelist. St John's Church has a Norman tower, and inside the church is a Norman font.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Church windows depict a Zeppelin raid on the village in 1916.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} An [[Iron Age]] shield was discovered near here in 1826. It is called the [[Witham Shield]] and is now in the [[British Museum]].<ref>[http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/t/the_witham_shield.aspx Witham Shield], accessed August 2010</ref>
