The '''''Wiesbaden'' class''' of [[light cruiser]]s was a class of ships built by the German ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial Navy) shortly before the outbreak of [[World War I]].  Two ships were built in this class, {{SMS|Wiesbaden||2}} and {{SMS|Frankfurt||2}}. They were very similar to the preceding design, the {{sclass|Graudenz|cruiser|4}}, though they were armed with eight [[15 cm SK L/45]] guns instead of the twelve [[10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun|10.5 cm SK L/45]] guns on the earlier vessels. The ships had a top speed of {{convert|27.5|kn|lk=in}}.

''Wiesbaden'' saw only one major action, the [[Battle of Jutland]], on 31 May &ndash; 1 June 1916. She was badly damaged and immobilized during the battle and became the center of a melee as both sides fought over the crippled ship. She eventually sank in the early morning hours of 1 June, with only one survivor. ''Frankfurt'' was only lightly damaged at Jutland and saw extensive service with the II Scouting Group, including during [[Operation Albion]] against the Russians in the Baltic and at the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight (1917)|Second Battle of Heligoland Bight]], both in 1917. She was interned with the rest of the fleet at the end of the war and [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|scuttled at Scapa Flow]], though British sailors prevented her from sinking. ''Frankfurt'' was ceded to the [[US Navy]] as a [[war prize]] and eventually expended as a target in July 1921.

==Design==
===Dimensions and machinery===
The ships were {{convert|141.7|m|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|145.3|m|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. They had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|13.9|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.76|m|abbr=on}} forward and {{convert|6.06|m|abbr=on}} aft. They displaced {{convert|5180|MT|sp=us}} at designed displacement and {{convert|6601|MT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. The hulls were built with longitudinal steel frames and contained seventeen [[watertight compartment]]s and a [[double bottom]] that extended for forty-seven percent of the length of the keel. Steering was controlled by a single rudder. ''Wiesbaden'' and ''Frankfurt'' had a crew of 17 officers and 457 enlisted men. They carried a number of smaller craft, including one picket boat, one barge, one cutter, two [[yawl]]s, and two [[dinghy|dinghies]].<ref name=G111>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 111</ref>

Their propulsion systems consisted of two sets of Marine [[steam turbine]]s driving two {{convert|3.5|m|adj=on|sp=us}} propellers. They were designed to give {{convert|31000|shp|lk=in}}. These were powered by twelve coal-fired Marine-type [[water-tube boiler]]s and two oil-fired double-ended boilers. These gave the ship a top speed of {{convert|27.5|kn}}. The ships of the class carried {{convert|1280|t|LT}} of coal, and an additional {{convert|470|t|LT}} of oil that gave them a range of {{convert|4800|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}. At {{convert|25|kn|abbr=on}}, the cruising radius dropped significantly, to {{convert|1200|nmi|abbr=on}}. ''Wiesbaden'' was equipped with a pair of turbo generators and one diesel generator rated at a combined {{convert|300|kW}} at 220&nbsp;[[Volt]]s. ''Frankfurt'' only had the two turbo generators, which provided {{convert|240|kW|abbr=on}}.<ref name=G111/>

===Armament and armor===
The ships of the ''Wiesbaden'' class were armed with eight [[15 cm SK L/45|15&nbsp;cm SK L/45 guns]] in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the [[forecastle]], four were located amidships, two on either side, and two were placed in a [[superfire|superfiring pair]] aft.<ref name=G1112>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 112</ref> The guns could engage targets out to {{convert|17600|m|abbr=on}}. They were supplied with 1,024 rounds of ammunition, for 128 shells per gun. The ships' antiaircraft armament initially consisted of four {{convert|5.2|cm|abbr=on}} L/44 guns, though these were replaced with a pair of [[8.8 cm SK L/45 naval gun|8.8&nbsp;cm SK L/45]] anti-aircraft guns. The ships were also equipped with four {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s with eight [[torpedo]]es. Two were submerged in the hull on the [[broadside]] and two were mounted on the deck amidships. They also could also carry 120 [[naval mine|mines]].<ref name=G111/> 

''Wiesbaden'' and ''Frankfurt'' were protected by a waterline [[armored belt]] that was {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on}} thick amidships; the belt was reduced to {{convert|18|mm|abbr=on}} forward. The stern was not armored. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides and a {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on}} thick roof. The rangefinder atop the conning tower had {{convert|30|mm|abbr=on}} worth of armor protection. The deck was covered with 60&nbsp;mm thick armor plate forward, {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} amidships, and 20&nbsp;mm aft. Sloped armor 40&nbsp;mm thick connected the deck to the belt armor. The main battery gun shields were {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=G111/>

==Service history==
===''Wiesbaden''===
{{main|SMS Wiesbaden}}
''Wiesbaden'' was ordered under the contract name "''[[Ersatz]]'' {{SMS|Gefion||2}}" and was laid down at the [[AG Vulcan]] shipyard in [[Stettin]] in 1913 and launched on 20 January 1915, after which [[fitting-out]] work commenced. She was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] on 23 August 1915,<ref name=G1112>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 111<U+2013>112</ref> after being rushed through trials.<ref name=GG162>Gardiner & Gray, p. 162</ref> The ship saw only one major action, the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May &ndash; 1 June 1916. The ship was badly damaged by gunfire from the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Invincible|1908|6}}. Immobilized between the two battle fleets, ''Wiesbaden'' became the center of a hard-fought action that saw the destruction of two British [[armored cruisers]].<ref>Tarrant, pp. 127&ndash;141</ref> Heavy fire from the British fleet prevented evacuation of the ship's crew.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 170&ndash;171</ref> ''Wiesbaden'' remained afloat until the early hours of 1 June and sank sometime between 01:45 and 02:45. Only one crew member survived the sinking; the wreck was located by German Navy divers in 1983.<ref>Campbell, pp. 294&ndash;295</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nolimitsdiving.dk/NLD/Projekter/Jyllands_Slaget/Tur%202010/js_start2010.htm|title=Battle of Jutland 2010|author=Thomas Nielsen |year=2010|publisher=No Limits Diving |accessdate=28 December 2011}}</ref>

===''Frankfurt''===
{{main|SMS Frankfurt}}
''Frankfurt'' was ordered under the contract name "''[[Ersatz]]'' {{SMS|Hela||2}}" and was laid down at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|''Kaiserliche Werft'']] shipyard in [[Kiel]] in 1913 and launched on 20 March 1915. The ships was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 20 August 1915.<ref name=G1112/> ''Frankfurt'' saw extensive action with the High Seas Fleet during [[World War I]]. She served primarily in the [[North Sea]], and participated in the [[Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft]] and the battles of Jutland and [[Battle of Heligoland Bight (1917)|Second Heligoland]]. At Jutland, she was lightly damaged by a British cruiser and her crew suffered minor casualties. The ship was also present during [[Operation Albion]] in the [[Baltic Sea]] in October 1917.<ref>Staff, pp. 3&ndash;4</ref> At the end of the war, she was interned with the bulk of the German fleet in [[Scapa Flow]]. When the fleet was [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|scuttled in June 1919]],<ref>Herwig, p. 256</ref> ''Frankfurt'' was one of the few ships that were not successfully sunk.<ref>Woodward, p. 183</ref> She was ceded to the [[US Navy]] as a [[war prize]] and ultimately expended as a bomb target in tests conducted by the US Navy and [[USAAF|Army Air Force]] in July 1921.<ref>Miller, p. 32</ref>
