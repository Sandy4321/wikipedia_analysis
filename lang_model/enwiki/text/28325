The '''[[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] air raids on [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]''', [[Australia]], on 19 February 1942 were the largest attacks ever mounted by a foreign power against Australia. They were also a significant action in the [[Pacific War|Pacific campaign]] of [[World War II]] and represented a psychological blow to the Australian population, several weeks after hostilities with Japan had begun. The raids were the first of almost 100 [[Japanese air attacks on Australia, 1942-43|air raids against Australia during 1942<U+2013>43]].

This event is often called the "[[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] of Australia". Although it was a less significant military target, a greater number of bombs were dropped on Darwin than were used in the attack on Pearl Harbor.<ref>{{cite book

At the time, Darwin had a population of about 2,000&mdash;the normal civilian population of about 5,000 had been reduced by evacuation. It was a strategically-placed naval port and airbase, and there were about 15,000 Allied soldiers in the area.

==The forces==
Most of the attacking planes came from the four [[aircraft carrier]]s of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s Carrier Division&nbsp;1 ([[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|''Kaga'']]) and Carrier Division&nbsp;2 ([[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry<U+016B>|''Hiry<U+016B>'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>|''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>'']]). Land-based [[heavy bomber]]s were also involved. The Japanese launched two waves of planes, comprising 242 [[bomber]]s and [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]].{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

Darwin was poorly covered by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns, there being only light automatic weapons and none of 20&nbsp;mm or greater calibre.<ref>Tom Hall ''Darwin 1942 Australia's Darkest Hour'', pages 104<U+2013>105, Methuen 1980.</ref> The only operational [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) fighter squadrons were in Europe, [[North Africa]] or the Middle East. The only modern fighters based in Darwin were 11 [[P-40]]s from the [[United States Army Air Forces|US Army Air Force]]'s 33rd Pursuit Squadron. There were a few lightly armed  or obsolete training (five unserviceable [[CAC Wirraway|Wirraway]]s) and patrol (six [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson]]) aircraft belonging to the RAAF. An experimental [[radar]] station was not yet operational.

==The attacks==
[[Image:Neptuna explosion 19 February 1942.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[MV Neptuna]]'' explodes at Stokes Hill Wharf. In front of the explosion is [[HMAS Vigilant|''HMAS Vigilant'']] which is undertaking rescue work. In the centre background is the floating dry dock holding the corvette [[HMAS Katoomba|HMAS ''Katoomba'']]. In the foreground is the damaged [[SS Zealandia|SS ''Zealandia'']].]]
The first wave of 188 Japanese planes, led by naval Commander [[Mitsuo Fuchida]] took off at 8:45 a.m. At about 9:15 a.m., it was<U+2014>although this is disputed by Robert Rayner in the book ''Darwin Fortress''<U+2014>spotted by an Australian [[Coastwatcher]] on [[Melville Island, Northern Territory|Melville Island]], and then also by Father John McGrath, a Catholic priest conducting missionary work on [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]].<ref>Lockwood, p. 23.</ref> Father McGrath sent a message, "An unusually large air formation bearing down on us from the northwest". Darwin received both warnings at least twice by radio, no later than 9:37 a.m. However, 11 US P-40E [[Curtiss P-40|Kittyhawk]] fighters and an LB-30 [[B-24 Liberator|Liberator]] had just departed Darwin and the Australian duty officer assumed this was the same formation. The warnings were not acted upon, so as at Pearl Harbor two months earlier, Darwin's final chance to make last-minute preparations for the impending raid slipped away. 

A USN [[PBY Catalina|Catalina aircraft]] near Bathurst Island was pounced upon by nine of the Zero fighters, and the plane caught fire although it defended itself. Its pilot Lieutenant [[Thomas Moorer]] managed to crash land upon the sea and the crew were picked up by a passing freighter, the ''Florence D''. However, it was later attacked and sunk, although Moorer and most of his crew survived to be later picked up on land. Another nearby ship, the ''Don Isidro'', was also sunk.

Fuchida later wrote of the raid:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.users.bigpond.com/battleforAustralia/battaust/DarwinAirraids.html |title=Japanese Air Raids on Darwin}} cites this to the book ''Midway: The Battle that Doomed Japan'', referenced below.</ref>
{{cquote| [''T'']''he job to be done seemed hardly worthy of the Nagumo Force. The harbour, it is true, was crowded with all kinds of ships, but a single pier and a few waterfront buildings appeared to be the only port installations. The airfield on the outskirts of the town, though fairly large, had no more than two or three small hangars, and in all there were only twenty-odd planes of various types scattered about the field. No planes were in the air. A few attempted to take off as we came over but were quickly shot down, and the rest were destroyed where they stood. Anti-aircraft fire was intense but largely ineffectual, and we quickly accomplished our objectives.'' }}
[[Image:Darwin raid (AWM 044603).jpg|thumb|left|An aerial photograph of vessels burning in Darwin Harbour taken by a Japanese airman during the first raid.]]

In fact, the Japanese encountered five of the USAAF P-40s, which had recently returned from an aborted mission over [[Timor]] and were still carrying [[drop tank]]s&mdash;with both numbers and surprise on their side, Japanese fighters shot down all of the US planes, except one piloted by Lt Robert Ostreicher.

A total of 81 [[Nakajima B5N]] "Kate" torpedo bombers then attacked shipping<U+2014>at least 45 vessels&mdash;in the harbour, while 71 [[Aichi D3A]] "Val" dive-bombers, escorted by 36 [[Mitsubishi A6M]] Zero fighter planes attacked [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) bases, civil airfields, and a hospital. Ostreicher shot down two Vals, and managed to survive the attack, but no Allied planes successfully took off, and all were destroyed or rendered unable to fly after the first attack. By about 10:40 a.m. the first wave of Japanese planes had left the area.

Just before midday, there was a high altitude attack by land-based bombers, concentrated on the [[RAAF Base Darwin|Darwin RAAF Airfield]]: 27 [[Mitsubishi G3M]] "Nell" bombers flew from [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and 27 [[Mitsubishi G4M]] "Betty" from [[Kendari]], [[Sulawesi]]. This second raid lasted for 20<U+2013>25 minutes.

In spite of Fuchida's assessment of the anti-aircraft fire as "largely ineffectual", the lack of armour and self-sealing fuel tanks in many Japanese planes, as well as the prolonged low-level [[strafe|strafing]] runs carried out, made pilots and planes exceptionally vulnerable to ground fire.<ref>Lockwood, p. 84.</ref>Most Australian sources say that four Japanese planes were destroyed in Australian airspace.

==Casualties, damage and consequences==

The number of people killed during the 19 February raids is disputed. The Lowe Commission, which investigated them in March 1942, identified 243 victims but assuming a few were unidentified concluded "the number is approximately 250".<ref>   http://www.territorystories.nt.gov.au/bitstream/handle/10070/83913/Lowe_Report.pdf?sequence=1 Pg 9</ref> Some researchers and government officials, including John Bradford (author of ''In the Highest Traditions - RAN Heroism Darwin 19 February 1942''),<ref>http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/darwin02.htm</ref> Dr. Peter Stanley (the Australian War Memorial<U+2019>s Principal Historian and author of several books about Australian military history),<ref> http://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/remembering1942/darwin/transcript.asp , http://www.awm.gov.au/events/talks/oration2006.asp</ref> Tom Womack (author of ''The Dutch Naval Air Force against Japan'') <ref> http://www.netherlandsnavy.nl/Special_darwin.htm</ref> and Rear Admiral [[Kevin Scarce]] (governor of South Australia), <ref> http://www.governor.sa.gov.au/index.php?m=selected-speeches&itemID=497 </ref> have said there were 250<U+2013>262 fatalities.

However, a plaque unveiled in Darwin in 2001 gave the total as 292.<ref>Peter Grose, An awkward truth: the bombing of Darwin, February 1942, Crow<U+2019>s Nest, NSW Allen & Unwin (2009) http://books.google.com/books?id=5DNwgDOh-eYC&lpg=PP1&ots=WCwT97lOXp&dq=an%20awkward%20truth&pg=PA192#v=onepage&q=&f=false  </ref> Peter Grose, author of ''An Awkward Truth'', wrote:

"[the plaque] lists William B. Preston's fatalities as 10, rather than the correct 15<U+2026>With the William B. Preston total corrected to 15, a figure of 297 known dead is the best count anyone is likely to achieve<U+2026>the full death toll is likely to be a little over 300, perhaps as many as 310 or 320."<ref>Grose, pg 193</ref>

In 2000 Darwin historian Peter Forrest, who spoke to survivors and researched the attacks for an unpublished book, said (as paraphrased by a journalist), "the first Japanese air raids on Darwin probably killed more than double the official figure of 243"<ref> http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-38718802.html </ref> but two years later lowered his estimate to "anything up to double that 243".<ref> http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2002/s485505.htm </ref>

Other estimates put the toll far higher: one soldier who was there claimed to have seen barges filled with bodies towed out to sea, a member of one of the burial teams recounted seeing uncounted bodies <U+201C>shoved in a large hole dug by a bulldozer<U+201D> (paraphrase), according to some sources Darwin mayor Jack Burton estimated 900 people were killed, Rex Ruwoldt one of the soldiers attacked that day says that a few days after the raid he was told over the field telephone that Army Intelligence estimated 1,100 were killed.<ref>http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/darwin02.htm </ref> According to an AP article about the 50th anniversary of the attacks "some estimates say as many as 1,000 died".<ref> http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920219&slug=1476547 </ref> Bradford<ref> http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/darwin02.htm </ref>and Forrest<ref> http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2002/s485505.htm </ref> said they spoke to survivors who estimated as many as 1,500 people died. Stanley and Grose rejected such numbers. The former said "it was certainly not the 1,024 claimed recently in unsubstantiated reports" <ref>http://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/remembering1942/darwin/transcript.asp </ref> and the latter wrote "numbers such as 1,100 are fancifully high".<ref>Grose, http://books.google.com/books?id=5DNwgDOh-eYC&dq=an+awkward+truth&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=WCwT97lOXp&sig=TtTwnxGb_Z1pq0nq7D38f3JZgEQ&hl=en&ei=sx7KSvqvBaOltgfG8cS6Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5#v=onepage&q=fancifully&f=false  pg. 191</ref>

By contrast there is less dispute over the number of injured during the attacks. The Lowe Commission estimated "between 300 and 400" people were wounded <ref>http://www.territorystories.nt.gov.au/bitstream/handle/10070/83913/Lowe_Report.pdf?sequence=1  Pg 9 </ref> Historian Tom Lewis says the number was over 400, about 200 of which were seriously injured.<ref>Tom Lewis (2003). ''A War at Home: A comprehensive guide to the first Japanese attacks on Darwin''. Tall Stories, Darwin. pp. 63<U+2013>71</ref> Womack wrote that 311 were wounded.<ref> http://www.netherlandsnavy.nl/Special_darwin.htm </ref> Grose wrote: 

<blockquote>...if 900 or 1100 died, why were the numbers of injured so low? The count of the injured is more accurate, because they were treated in hospital or shipped out aboard the Manunda [a hospital ship]. The hospitals and Manunda noted names and numbers of those they treated.<ref>Grose pg 191</ref></blockquote>

Preston]] which had already departed Darwin was attacked at sea and docked at [[Derby]]

The USAAF lost ten P-40s, one [[B-24]] bomber, and three [[Beechcraft Model 18|C-45]] transport planes. The US Navy lost three [[PBY Catalina]] flying boats, and moorers outside the harbour. The RAAF lost six [[Lockheed Hudson]]s. One of the PBY pilots shot down and injured was (then) Lt. [[Thomas Moorer]] later to become [[Chief of Naval Operations]] and [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]].

The air raids caused chaos in Darwin, with most essential services including water and electricity being badly damaged or destroyed.<ref>Lockwood, p. 143.</ref> Fears of an imminent invasion spread and there was a wave of refugees, as half of the town's civilian population fled. There were reports of looting, with [[Provost Marshal]]s being among the accused.<ref>Lockwood, p. 159.</ref>  According to official figures, 278 [[RAAF]] servicemen were considered to have [[desertion|deserted]] as a result of the raids, although it has been argued that the 'desertions' were mostly the result of ambiguous orders given to RAAF ground staff after the attacks.<ref>Lockwood, pp. 143<U+2013>146.</ref> Following the second Japanese air raid, the local RAAF [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] Sturt Griffith:
{{cquote| "... summoned his senior administrative officer, [[Squadron Leader]] Swan, and gave a verbal order that all airmen were to move half a mile down the main road and then half a mile inland. At this vague rendezvous point ... arrangements would be made to feed them. The order led to utter chaos. In being passed by word of mouth from one section to another, sometimes with officers present and sometimes not, it became garbled to the extent it was unrecognizable against the original. In its ultimate form it was interpreted, especially by those desiring such an interpretation, of an impending order for immediate and general evacuation of the area. Highly exaggerated rumours of an impending Japanese invasion had already reached the base from the town and spread quickly among those wanting to believe them. In the absence of restraint, men gathered their belongings" and abandoned their stations.<ref>Lockwood, pp. 143<U+2013>44.</ref> }}

While the Northwest area staff could see what was happening and issued countermanding orders, "the damage was done and hundreds of men were already beyond recall".<ref>Lockwood, p. 144.</ref>

The Australian army faced difficulty controlling its own troops from looting private property including "furniture, refrigerators, stoves, pianos, clothes [and] even children's toys" due to the breakdown of law and order after the bombing and the ensuing chaos.<ref>Lockwood, p. 169.</ref> Many civilian refugees never returned, or did not return for many years, and in the post-war years some claimed that land they owned in Darwin had been expropriated by government bodies in their absence.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Further Japanese raids==
After the massive 19 February 1942 Japanese raid, the Northern Territory and parts of Western Australia's north were bombed 62 more times between 4 March 1942 and 12 November 1943.<ref>Lewis, op. cit.</ref> One of the heaviest attacks took place on 16 June 1942 when a large Japanese force set fire to the oil fuel tanks around the harbour and inflicted severe damage to the vacant banks, stores and railway yards. The [[Allied]] navies largely abandoned the naval base at Darwin after the initial 19 February attack, dispersing most of their forces to [[Brisbane]], [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] and other smaller ports. Conversely, Allied air commanders launched a major build-up in the Darwin area, building more airfields and deploying many squadrons.

The four IJN aircraft carriers (''Akagi'', ''Kaga'', ''Hiry<U+016B>'' and ''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>'') that participated in the Bombing of Darwin were sunk during the [[Battle of Midway]] in June 1942.

A memorial ceremony is held every year on 19 February at the Cenotaph in Darwin. It starts at 9:58am, the precise time of the first attack.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

* The raid is portrayed in the film ''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]]'' as a major plot event.
