{{nihongo|'''''Xenogears'''''|<U+30BC><U+30CE><U+30AE><U+30A2><U+30B9>|Zenogiasu}} is a [[console role-playing game]] developed and published by [[Square Co.|Square]] (now [[Square Enix]]) for [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony's]] [[PlayStation]]. It was released on February 11, 1998 in Japan and on October 21, 1998 in North America. The game was never released in [[PAL region|PAL]] territories. The game was re-released by [[Square Enix]] for the Japanese [[PlayStation Network]] on June 25, 2008.

''Xenogears'' follows protagonist Fei Fong Wong and several others as they struggle to survive in a world torn apart by war between the nations of Aveh and Kislev. The principles and philosophies of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]] and [[Jacques Lacan]], as well as various religious themes influence the overall plot and world of ''Xenogears''. A major theme of the game is the nature of human memory: from the start of the game, Fei has [[memory loss]], which colors his interactions with other characters. In addition, the struggle between man and machine is also central to the game's plot. Each of the playable characters can ride in giant [[mecha|mechs]] known as gears and can use them in battle. 

Overall, ''Xenogears'' was well-received by critics, with a 91% rating on [[Game Rankings]] and a score of 83 out of 100 at [[Metacritic]]. It was voted the 16th best video game of all time by readers of ''[[Famitsu]]'' in 2006. A commercial success, ''Xenogears'' has sold 1.19 million copies worldwide as of March 31, 2003. Due to these high sales, the game was re-released as a [[List of Sony Greatest Hits games|Greatest Hits]] title in December 2003.

==Gameplay==
''Xenogears'' gameplay combines traditional [[console role-playing game]] elements with new innovative features. It features [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] sprites overlaid on [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] backgrounds and two different battle systems: the first uses the characters in combo-based physical combat and the second takes place in [[turn-based]] "gear" battles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://na.square-enix.com/games/xenogears/world.html|title=Xenogears - World|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref> ''Xenogears'' uses both traditional [[anime]] and pre-rendered [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] movie clips by [[Production I.G]] during important plot points.<ref name="firstlook">{{cite web | first=Peter|last=Bartholow | date=1997-09-06 | title=First Look at Xenogears | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2467580.html |publisher=[[GameSpot]]| accessdate=2008-08-08}}</ref>

The player controls the protagonist and his party through a fully three-dimensional fictional world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://na.square-enix.com/games/xenogears/fields.html|title=Xenogears Fields|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref> There is an [[overworld]] map with different locations spread out across several continents. At first, the party only travels on foot, but is eventually permitted to travel via a variety of vehicles, including their gears.

[[File:Xenogearsbattlescene.jpg|thumb|left|An example of a normal battle]]

===Battle system===
Battling is a variant of the [[Final Fantasy gameplay#Parties and battles|Active Time Battle]] system found in various ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games and ''[[Chrono Trigger]]''.<ref name="Battle">{{cite web|url=http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/xenogears/features.html|title=Xenogears Features|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref>  Most enemy encounters in Xenogears are [[random encounter|random]], and once a battle starts, the screen enters a separate combat screen. Characters fight with martial arts combat and "Ether" attacks along with special "Deathblow" moves that are learned through repeated combinations of strong, moderate, and weak hits. Attacks use [[action point|Action Points]] (AP) and either cost three points, two points, or one point.<ref name="imbattle">{{cite book |editor=Square Enix |title=Xenosaga Instruction Booklet |year=1998 |publisher=Square Enix |isbn= |pages=22<U+2013>25}}</ref> Each character can initially use three AP per turn, but at higher levels, characters eventually can use six AP per turn. At a certain point in the story, an additional AP is acquired, allowing characters to learn "Elemental Deathblows". In addition to being used for attacks, AP may be saved and used as Attack Points for combo attacks during later turns. A total of 28 AP may be accumulated for combo attacks.

Characters can also use magical abilities that either aid the party or damage enemies. These abilities are limited by the number of [[magic point|Ether Points]] (EP) that are available to a character and are not replenished between attack rounds. For most characters, these abilities are called Ether, but some characters' abilities have different names, implying differences in their origins. For example, Fei's magic is called "[[Qi|Chi]]" and Citan's is called "[[Esotericism|Arcane]]". While fighting in their gears, characters' Ether abilities are amplified, though some change or become unavailable during this type of combat.<ref name="Battle"/>

===Gear battle===
In addition to small-scale, hand-to-hand combat, the characters sometimes fight from within their respective combat robots, called gears.<ref name="GameSpot"/> For these particular battles, the combination style is reduced to a selection of strong, medium, or weak attacks that build up the attack level of the gear with each attack so that the gear can unleash a special attack. While in gears, the limiting factor of AP is replaced with a fuel gauge, with each attack consuming an amount relative to its power.<ref name="GameSpot"/> There are three levels of normal special gear attacks and one additional "infinite" level of special gear attacks that correspond to a character's learned Deathblow skills. Infinite level differs from the other three levels in several ways. "Infinity Mode" lasts for three turns; while in this mode, fuel can be recharged in larger amounts and gears can use "Infinity" attacks. To reach Infinity Mode, a character has to stay at attack level 3 while performing any other action. With each turn, there is a chance that Infinity Mode will be reached. 

Gears can regain fuel with a "Charge" command. The gears can also activate "Boosters" which enable them to act faster at a cost of extra fuel per turn.<ref name="GameSpot"/> The "Special Option" command allows for gear [[health (game mechanic)|HP]] restoration abilities and special attacks. When a gear has no fuel left, it can no longer execute attacks, use special options, or use boosters. They can, however, Charge to regain fuel and use Ether abilities. The main characters can purchase gear fuel, parts, and upgrades in shops or from certain individuals.

==Plot==
===Setting===
''Xenogears'' initially takes place on Ignas, the largest continent of the ''Xenogears'' world, and site of a centuries long war between the nations of Aveh and Kislev.<ref>{{cite web | first=|last=IGN staff| date=1998-08-18 | title=Xenogears Preview | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/122/122230p1.html |publisher=[[IGN]]| accessdate=2009-11-18}}</ref> A church-like organization known as the Ethos has excavated [[Mecha|gears]] in the name of preserving the world's culture. Although Kislev originally had the upper hand in the war, a mysterious army known as Gebler appeared and started providing assistance to Aveh. With Gebler's help, the Aveh military not only recovered its losses, but began making its way into Kislev's territory. As the story unfolds, the setting shifts to encompass the entire world and the two floating cities, Shevat and Solaris. Solaris, commanding the Gebler army and the Ethos, secretly control the land dwelling humans and is ruled by Emperor Cain and the Gazel Ministry. Shevat has been the only country to evade the control of Solaris.

Much of ''Xenogears'' plot and backstory is detailed in the [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-only book ''Xenogears Perfect Works.'' This book, produced by the now defunct [[DigiCube]], details the history of the ''Xenogears'' universe from the discovery of the [[Zohar]] to the start of the game.<ref>{{cite web | author=Chronologist | date=2001-11-27 | title=Massive Final Fantasy Series Media Update |publisher=RPGFan| url=http://www.rpgfan.com/news/2001/1609.html | accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first=Chris|last=Winkler | date=2003-11-29 | title=DigiCube Files for Bankruptcy | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/news/2003/2188.html | publisher=RPGFan|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> According to the ''Perfect Works'' schematic (as well as the game's end credits), ''Xenogears'' is the fifth episode in a series of six.

===Characters===
{{Main|Characters of Xenogears}}
''Xenogears''' nine playable [[Fictional characters|characters]] hail from different areas of the game's world. The game begins on Ignas, a continent with two countries, Aveh and Kislev. Fei and Citan at first appear to be from this land, although it is later learned that they are from the floating cities of Shevat and Solaris, respectively. Fei is the story's protagonist, and has initially lost his memories of his past. Citan is a man whose knowledge of the world and technology often aids in the party's quest. Bart, a desert pirate, is also from Ignas and is the rightful heir to the throne of Aveh. Rico, a [[demi-human]] with incredible strength, lives in a Kislev prison, spending his days as a gear-battling champion. Solaris, a hidden city of advanced technology, is home to several characters in the game. Billy, a pious worker for the Ethos religious group, was originally from Solaris. Elly, a Gebler officer of Solaris, is destined to be near Fei and falls in love with him by the end of the game. Maria and Chu-Chu are both from Shevat, the floating city and the only place resisting Solaris' domination. Emeralda is a colony of [[nanomachines]] from the ancient civilization Zeboim.<ref>'''Krelian''': A nanomachine... a molecular machine... Until recently, we were only able to produce... materials which were several times the size of this. Thanks to that girl, the one we obtained from the ruins of the Zeboim civilization, we are now able to make it this compact and elaborate. {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2008-08-17 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> Krelian and Miang are both leaders of Solaris who seek to revive Deus, a mechanical god that fell to earth thousands of years ago. They serve as the game's main [[antagonist]]s. Grahf, a mysterious man with immense power, follows Fei and his group and often fights them, though his goals remain a mystery until very late in the game. Fei, Elly, and Miang have been reincarnated several times throughout the game's history.<ref name="parish"/>

===Story===
''Xenogears'' centers around the [[protagonist]] Fei Fong Wong, an adopted young male in the village, Lahan, brought by a mysterious "masked man" three years ago.<ref name="characters">{{cite book |editor=Brady Games |title=Xenosaga Official Strategy Guide |year=1998 |publisher=BradyGames |isbn=1-56686-825-4 |pages=11<U+2013>20}}</ref> The events surrounding Fei's arrival at the village cause him to have [[retrograde amnesia]]. During an attack on Lahan from Gebler, Fei pilots an empty gear and fights the enemy, accidentally destroying the village. As a result, Fei and Citan, the village's doctor, decide to leave with the abandoned gear to get it away from the village.<ref>'''Citan''':And Fei... it may be a good idea for you to leave this place. There is no guarantee that reinforcements from yesterday's units are not going to come.{{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> Fei meets Elly, a Gebler officer, and Grahf, who claims to know about Fei's past. Eventually, Fei and Citan are picked up by Bart, a desert pirate and heir to the throne of Aveh. Fei again loses control of himself inside his gear while Bart and Citan are attacked by an unknown red gear. Fei wakes up in a Kislev prison and meets Wiseman, a mysterious masked man, who originally brought Fei to Lahan.<ref>'''Citan''': The Yggdrasil was badly damaged and sank...I jumped in an escape-pod. {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> Fei is able to escape with the help of his friends, but he and Elly are separated from the rest of the party and accidentally shot down by Bart.<ref>'''Bart''':Rah hah hah!! That's the power of the Bart Missiles!! Even Kislev's prototype can't stand up to it!! ...Uh, hey... S-stay back... Keep away!{{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref>

The transparent text-box dipicts the narrative with the image on the left indicating the character currently speaking. Meanwhile Fei and Elly stand at different areas and non-dialogue actions are shown on the screen.]]

They are rescued by the Thames, a movable floating city. After learning Elly's whereabouts, Gebler attacks Thames to kidnap Elly and Miang, a Gebler officer, unsuccessfully brainwashes her. Ramsus, who holds a vendetta against Fei, attacks Thames, searching for him.<ref>'''Ramsus''': Right. I've got him! I have been looking for you! My arch rival! {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> Afterward, Billy, an Ethos worker onboard Thames, allows Fei to use the Ethos' advanced medical technology. Bishop Stone, Ethos' leader, reveals to the party Ethos's true purpose of controlling the land dwellers, or "Lambs", for Solaris.<ref>'''Stone''': You believed that you were saving wandering souls weren't you? That's why you carried out your cleansing of the 'Reapers', -Wels- from the earth, right? In fact it was all just another control system put in place by Solaris. But what's more, your 'saving' work... that very activity you believed in so much, was in reality...{{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> The group follows Stone to Zeboim, an excavation site. They discover a young girl composed of [[nanomachine]]s, which is what Krelian, a Solarian leader, seeks. Stone takes the girl while the group fights Id, the mysterious red gear's pilot, who wants the girl, but is stopped by Wiseman.<ref>'''Id''': To you, it is just a used-up toy. So give it back. It belongs to me... {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> The group returns and finds Fei awake and standing at his gear with a case of [[anterograde amnesia]].<ref>'''Fei''': I don't know what I'm doing here myself... I don't have a clear head yet. {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> Fei and his friends decide to ally themselves with the floating city of Shevat, the only remaining city capable of resisting Solaris. When entering Solaris, they encounter Emeralda, the nanomachine colony. She attacks at first, but recognizes Fei, referring to him as "Kim", much to Fei's confusion.<ref>'''Rattan''': With that, excuse me. I must report the results. Oh yes, go ahead and take the girl. Use her anyway you like. After all, she is your daughter... {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> In Solaris, Fei learns that Citan has been working for Emperor Cain and that Solaris has been producing food and medicine out of [[Cannibalism|recycled humans]] in the Soylent System facility.<ref>'''Citan''': Soylent System. The organism experiment lab and its disposal facility in Solaris. And the production facility for food and medicine to maintain the Limiter seal. {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> The party also learns that the Gazel Ministry seeks to revive Deus and achieve eternal life, while Krelian seeks to possess Elly. Back at Shevat, Citan informs his friends that Id is actually Fei's [[Dissociative identity disorder|split personality]].<ref>'''Citan''': Yes, if it were only Id and Fei. But that does not seem to be the case. Id only manifests when Fei's mental energy is in a weakened state. It is a mystery in itself that the lower level personality of Fei...has any control over the upper level personality of Id. It is obvious that there exists a third personality. Id calls this existence the coward. In my observation, this coward may be the fundamental personality of Fei. {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> 

The Gazel Ministry uses the Gaetia Key, an artifact that manipulates the DNA of massive amounts of humans around the world, turning them into mutants called Wels in order to collect flesh to reconstruct a god called Deus that crash-landed on the planet ten thousand years ago.<ref>'''Elly as Miang''': Yes, but there is more... The core that was detached from Zohar, the 'Biological ComputerKadomony' crashed onto this primitive planet. It activated -Persona-, its lifesupport plant, that can generate organic material. {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> During this time, Elly and Fei become romantically involved with each other.<ref>'''Elly''': I also learned that I really do need you... It's not because I need you as a sanctuary for my problems. I need you because I truly love you. {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> They learn that they are the reincarnations of Sophia and Lacan. Lacan was a painter while Sophia was the Holy Mother of Nisan around the time of the war between Shevat and Solaris five-hundred years earlier. Lacan blamed himself for Sophia's death during the war and, with the help of Miang, became Grahf and sought to destroy the world. Although defeated, he and Miang have transmigrated their minds into other humans since. Krelian and Miang dispose of the Emperor and the Gazel Ministry because they are no longer necessary and kidnap Elly, the ''Mother'', who must be sacrificed in order to revive Deus. Miang is killed by an enraged Ramsus as he realizes he has been used, and Elly turns into Miang, becoming absorbed by Deus. Fei, as Id, attempts to make contact with the Zohar. Wiseman, who reveals himself to be Fei's father, stops him, giving peace to Fei's other personalities. Fei's gear transforms into the Xenogears and Grahf appears, revealing that he had been inside Fei's father's body.<ref>'''Grahf''': I hear you Fei... You see, He and I are one. I am Khan, Khan is me. He has become one with me, so you too should open your heart and unite with me. Then we can go onto eliminate everything! {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> At this time, Fei makes contact with the Wave Existence<U+2014>an extra-dimensional being who is trapped inside Deus and is the source of power for all gears<U+2014>and learns that he must destroy Deus to free humanity. Grahf, who tries to merge with Fei, is defeated.

Fei discovers that he is a descendant of Abel, a young boy who was a passenger on board the Eldridge, a spaceship that was being used to transport Deus, the core of an interplanetary invasion system created by a federation of spacefaring humans, one that was deemed far too dangerous for use and was therefore dismantled and moved.<ref name="parish">{{cite journal| journal = [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]| publisher = [[Ziff Davis]] Media| issue = 221| month = November| year = 2007| title = Retronauts Presents: WTFiction!?| first = Jeremy| last = Parish| pages = 132<U+2013>133}}</ref> Deus, however, had become [[self-aware]] and took over the Eldridge. Amidst the confusion, Abel was separated from his mother and accidentally made contact with the Wave Existence through the Zohar, Deus' power source. It gave him the power to one day destroy Deus and the Zohar in order to free itself. The Wave Existence also sensed Abel's longing for his mother and used the biological computer Kadomony to create a woman for a companion.<ref>'''Wave Existence''': As a contact, being but only a child, you defined my existence with your desire to return to your mother. Thus I came to prepare the mother's will... that will is Elhaym.{{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> When Deus gained full control over the Eldridge, the captain decided to initiate the self-destruct sequence in an attempt to destroy it. Both Deus and the Zohar survived the explosion and landed on a nearby planet along with Abel, under the protection of the Wave Existence. He was the sole survivor, but was soon united with the woman that the Wave Existence had created for him as a companion, Elly. Abel and Elly, at first, led a happy life, but Deus had also created Miang, Cain, and the Gazel Ministry to begin a human civilization on the planet, one which would be under their control to one day be turned into Wels and be absorbed into Deus to recover its strength. When the now-adult Abel and Elly discovered this, they openly challenged Cain and the Gazel Ministry, but lost. However, through the power of the Wave Existence, they are able to be reincarnated in later eras to combat Deus.<ref name="parish"/> One of these incarnations lived during an ancient technologically advanced era in Zeboim, where Abel's incarnation went by the name Kim and created Emeralda. 

Fei sets out to destroy Deus and free the Wave Existence and Elly. In Merkaba, the party defeats Deus, but they realize that the energy released from the Wave Existence's shift will destroy the planet.<ref>'''Citan''': It is like a shock wave that is induced by the dimensional displacement. But... so much energy!? If this much energy is unleashed here now...{{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> Elly, inside Deus, tries to move it away from the planet and Fei, in his Xenogears, follows to save her, but both disappear in the rift. Krelian confronts them, telling Fei he only sought to end the pain and suffering that comes with human existence by reverting everything back to when it all began, when all was one, to ascend to the realm of God. Fei rejects Krelian's ideology with his love for Elly, but Krelian challenges Fei, telling him to prove this love that could make him independent of God, and calls forth Urobolus, a gigantic serpent-like incarnation of Miang. Xenogears appears and Fei uses it to defeat Urobolus. Krelian releases Elly and reveals to Fei that he had planned to become one with God along with Elly. During her time with Krelian, Elly had seen inside his heart and realized it was full of sadness and despair for all the atrocities he had committed. Despite everything, Elly says that Krelian truly loved people more than anyone else.<ref>'''Elly''': Yes. I came to understand after becoming one with Krelian... His heart was so full of sadness. That is why he desired for he and I to become one with god... Because that would be the return to the beginning of everything... He told me... "You should be with him..." That is what he said... You see... He already knew! Yes, he already knew... how I felt, how you felt... But there was nothing we or he could do... He had no choice but to go foward... even if it meant he lost all feelings, lost everything that was human! For all humankind's sake... There was no going back... Even looking back held too many memories... And he would have... just wanted to go back... Even though he couldn't... So please forgive him... Krelian loved people more than anyone else...{{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref> Because no one will forgive his sins, he declines Fei's offer to return and ascends to a higher plain of existence along with the Wave Existence, telling Fei and Elly that he envies them. Fei and Elly then return to their planet along with Xenogears and reunite with the rest of the party.<ref>'''Krelian''': Since that time, I have stopped being human. I have committed so many sins that any attempt at living as a human is impossible. The only one who could have forgiven me is god. {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref>

An arranged soundtrack of ''Xenogears'' also composed and arranged by Mitsuda was released as ''[[Creid]]''. For ''Creid'', he expanded on the theme from the original album of having Celtic influences in "easy-to-listen-to" [[popular music|pop]] tracks to create an album of arranged ''Xenogears'' music with a more prominent Celtic style.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/interviews/yasunorimitsuda.shtml |title=Interview with Yasunori Mitsuda (October 2005) |accessdate=2008-07-25 |publisher=Square Enix Music Online |author=Chris |coauthors=Harry |date = October 2005}}</ref><ref name="xenogears"/> The album contains a mixture of vocal and instrumental tracks, and combines Japanese and Celtic music together in its pieces.<ref name="JAPCELT">{{cite web |url=http://mitsuda.cocoebiz.com/qanda/qanda_07-02.html |title=Questions from July, 2002 |accessdate=2008-07-22 |publisher=Procyon Studio |author=[[Yasunori Mitsuda]] |year=2002 |month=July}}</ref><ref name="RPGFC">{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/xeno-creid/index.html |title=Creid: Yasunori Mitsuda & Millenial Fair |accessdate=2009-07-02 |publisher=RPGFan |author=Gann, Patrick |date=2000-10-15}}</ref> The album features five vocal tracks and five instrumental tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mitsuda.cocoebiz.com/profile/resume.html|title=Profile - Resume|last=Mitsuda|first=Yasunori|publisher=Cocoebiz|accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref> The main lyricist, Junko Kudo, wrote the lyrics to four of the five vocal tracks, while Mitsuda wrote the lyrics to the titular track "Creid", which were then translated from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] to [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] for the recording.<ref name="qa april 2002">{{cite web |url=http://mitsuda.cocoebiz.com/qanda/qanda_04-02.html |title=Questions from April, 2002 |accessdate=2008-07-22 |publisher=Procyon Studio |author=[[Yasunori Mitsuda]] |year=2002 |month=April}}</ref> Celtic singer Joanne Hogg did not reprise her role in ''Creid''.<ref name="qa june 2002"/> Instead, Tetsuko Honma sang the four tracks written by Kudo, while [[Eimear Quinn]] sang "Creid".<ref>{{cite album-notes |title=Creid |bandname=[[Yasunori Mitsuda]] & Millennial Fair |year=1998 |publisher=[[DigiCube]] |publisherid=SSCX-10018 |location=[[Tokyo]]}}</ref>

===Critical response===
''Xenogears'' was met with generally positive reviews. [[Allgame]] pointed out in a positive light that the character battles are "unlike most role-playing games from this company".<ref name="allgame">{{cite web | first=Matthew|last=House| title=Xenogears | url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&sql=1:14104 | publisher=[[Allgame]]|accessdate=2008-08-07}}</ref> [[GameSpot]] wrote that the story becomes "a little preachy at times", but goes on to say that the religious and existential themes "enhance the story and [our] understanding of the game's deep characterizations".<ref name="GameSpot">{{cite web | first=Peter|last=Bartholow| date=1998-04-02 | title=Xenogears Review|publisher=[[GameSpot]] | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/xenogears/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;review | accessdate=2008-08-09}}</ref> ''Edge'' commented that although it is "considered by some to be a multimillion-yen, convoluted science-fiction vanity project, ''Xenogears'' nevertheless remains one of the most keenly eulogized PlayStation RPGs."<ref name="timeextend"/> The magazine also noted that it was Takahashi's "most challenging and pure work" and that the ''[[Xenosaga]]'' series never quite matched up to ''Xenogears''.<ref name="timeextend"/>

The game was criticized for having too many cut scenes, especially on the second disc, where the use of the world map is restricted for an extended period and the amount of cut scenes increases.<ref name="timeextend"/> IGN, however, stated that despite all the cut scenes and the confusing plot, "immersion is a key factor in ''Xenogears'' and the questions you may have about the storyline are all answered at some point in the game."<ref name="ign"/> ''Edge'' criticized its "flawed" script and "muddied" translation.<ref name="timeextend">{{cite web | author=Edge Staff | date=2007-10-10 | title=Time Extend: Xenogears | url=http://www.edge-online.com/magazine/time-extend-xenogears?page=0%2C0 |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]| accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref> Years after the game's release, [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] called the game's plot "one of the wackiest game plotlines ever", saying that it "actually makes sense" if the player ignores any of the sideplots.<ref name="parish"/>

The audio of ''Xenogears'' garnered praise from critics. GameSpot noted that many of the games' tracks "include voice or chanting and all are appropriately uppity or low with the game's mood", but complained that there were too many areas with silence or ambience.<ref name="GameSpot"/> ''Xenogears'' was the first Square game to feature voice overs and anime cut scenes.<ref name="GameSpot"/> These aspects were criticized by reviewers, like [[Game Revolution]], who stated that they were poorly synched and too sparse, respectively.<ref name="gamerev"/>

===Legacy===
Shortly after ''Xenogears'' was released, there was speculation of a sequel being released, although this never occurred.<ref name="xgtwoquestion">{{cite web |date=1999-06-25 | title=Square Developing Xenogears 2? |publisher=[[GameSpot]]|author=GameSpot Staff| url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2451155.html | accessdate=2008-08-19}}</ref> While ''Xenogears'' has never had an official sequel or prequel, there was wide speculation that [[Namco]] and [[Monolith Soft|Monolith Soft's]] ''Xenosaga'' was a prequel when it was first announced. [[Tetsuya Takahashi]] was the director and writer for both ''Xenogears'' and ''Xenosaga'' and has noted that "with our relation between Square, I think it is difficult for us to say it is a direct sequel or prequel". Approximately twenty members of the ''Xenosaga'' development staff had previously worked on ''Xenogears''.<ref name="interview">{{cite web|last=Sato|first=Ike|title=Xenosaga Interview |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/xenosaga/news.html?sid=2823598 |publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=2001-11-08|accessdate=2008-08-31}}</ref>

On the connection between ''Xenogears'' and ''Xenosaga'', Takahashi has stated:<blockquote>It's probably more suitable to say that it follows the direction and style of ''Xenogears''. [...] Now that we are under a different company, we figured we should start everything from scratch all over again. Though there are familiar faces that serve as important characters in ''Xenosaga'', others are more like self-parodies, so we don't really want ''Xenogears'' fans to overreact. Like movies, sometimes you have the director of the movie or friend of the leading actor appearing as cameos, so it's similar to that.<ref name="interview"/></blockquote>

Several members of the ''Xenogears'' staff came together in 2008 to work on ''[[Sands of Destruction]]'', a [[console role-playing game]] for the [[Nintendo DS]], published by [[Sega]]. These staff members include Masato Kato, Kunihiko Tanaka, and Yasunori Mitsuda.<ref>{{cite web | first=Jean|last=Snow | title=Sega Reunites Xenogears Staff For DS Game |work=[[Wired News]] |url=http://blog.wired.com/games/2008/04/rpg-world-of-de.html |date=2008-04-28| accessdate=2008-08-19}}</ref>
