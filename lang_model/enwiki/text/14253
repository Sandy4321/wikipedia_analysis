'''World Trade Center Barcelona''' is a [[business park]] located in [[Barcelona]], opened on July 22, 1999. This business center is located on the waterfront close to the city center, and has 40,000 [[m<U+00B2>]] of rented [[office]] and a [[conference center]], conventions and meeting spaces with 20 different rooms.

WTCB building structure was inspired by the shape of a boat surrounded by the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and created by renowned architect [[Henry N. Cobb]] who emphasized aesthetics. The arrangement of the four buildings in a circle creates a central plaza of 2,500 m<U+00B2>, where shops and restaurants provide services to the users of the complex. The four towers house offices for rent, a congress center and the Hotel Grand Marina.

Complex design allows to rent offices from 40 to 3,000 m<U+00B2> in a single plant. The flexibility of space is also a feature of the convention center, offering the possibility of organizing meetings of 8 to large events with up to 1,500 attendees.
