'''''This Hour Has 22 Minutes''''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[television]] comedy that airs on [[CBC Television]]. Launched in [[1993]] during [[Canadian federal election, 1993|Canada's 35th general election]], the show focuses on Canadian politics, combining news [[parody]], [[sketch comedy]] and [[satire|satirical]] editorials. Originally featuring [[Cathy Jones]], [[Rick Mercer]], [[Greg Thomey]] and [[Mary Walsh]], the series featured satirical sketches of the weekly news and Canadian political events. The show's format is a mock news program, intercut with comic sketches, fake commercials and humorous interviews of public figures. 

Its name is a parody of ''[[This Hour Has Seven Days]]'', a CBC newsmagazine from the [[1960s]]; the "22 Minutes" refers to the fact that a half-hour television program is actually 22 minutes long to make room for [[television commercial|commercial]]s.  

Jones and Walsh had previously worked together on the sketch comedy series ''[[CODCO]]'', on which Thomey sometimes appeared as a guest. Mercer had been a notable young writer and performer on his own, touring several successful one-man shows of comedic political commentary. 

[[Salter Street Films]] produced the series until the 2003-2004 season. Salter Street was acquired in [[2001]] by [[Alliance Atlantis]], and production of the series was transferred directly to Alliance Atlantis in the twelfth season. As of [[2005]], [[Halifax Film Company]] produces the show.

Recognized with 24 [[Gemini Awards]], ''22 Minutes'' is broadcast on the [[CBC Television]] network. It is taped before a studio audience in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. 

The show airs Tuesdays at 8:30pm on CBC.

==Regular characters and segments==
[[Image:Talkingtoamericans.jpg|right|thumb|550px|Talking to Americans logo]]
; [[Talking to Americans]]''
: Rick Mercer tours the [[United States]], talking to Americans as if from a Canadian news program, asking them about "Canadian issues."  The object is to see how little some Americans know about their northern neighbours. The piece was so popular that the CBC had Mercer create a one-hour TV special based on the segment.  It became the highest rated comedy special in Canadian television history when it aired on Canada Day, 2001. Some truly memorable bits include Rick Mercer getting Americans to say "Congratulations Canada on legalizing VCRs!" and getting a professor at Princeton University to sign a petition against the re-starting of the Annual Toronto Polar Bear Hunt. In an election 2000 segment, he convinced then-Governor of Texas [[George W. Bush]] that Canada's Prime Minister [[Jean Chr<U+00E9>tien]] was named Jean [[Poutine]] and that he was supporting Bush's candidacy.  The success of the CBC special got Mercer attention on numerous American media outlets, including ABC News [[Nightline]].  Mercer abandoned the concept after [[Sept. 11, 2001]].

; Marg Delahunty
: Mary Walsh crashes press conferences, hosts a "sleepover" for the nation's leading female (and gay) politicians, and threatens to "smite" the likes of politicians as "''Marg Princess Warrior''" (a loose parody of [[Xena: Warrior Princess|Xena]]).

: a weekly commentary on current events and political issues which quickly became the show's most famous feature by Rick Mercer in black and white presentations. This segment was later used in colour presentations on the ''[[Rick Mercer Report]]'' series.

;Max Pointy: A spoof of [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] personality [[Rex Murphy]]'s political commentaries for ''[[The National]]'', performed by Colin Mochrie.

;That Show Sucked!: with Ma and Eddie Reardon (portrayed by Mary Walsh & Greg Thomey) who make fun of TV shows, with Ma saying that whatever show that Eddie watches "Suck" and constantly demanding that he give her "the G.D. clickerbox".

;Inside Media Counter-spin: A satirical talk show with the host portrayed by Cathy Jones<!--TODO:Get her name-->. The host makes blatantly [[stereotype|stereotypical]] statements about her guests.
;Panic Room with Betty Hope: Host Betty Hope does these brief "breaking news" style segments, in which she interviews someone knowledgeable about a given threat and then spins the facts to make them sound more dramatic and dangerous; this can be interpreted as a parody of television journalists such as [[Nancy Grace]].
;The Right Answer: Two commentators (played by Rick Mercer and Greg Thomey) debate various issues in the news. When one of them makes a point, they hit a chess timer.
;The Special Eds: Mercer and Thomey portray two members of the RCMP - Special Constable Ed Cochrane and Special Constable Ed Codner - with questionable ethics.

==Famous stunts==
===Jean Poutine===

'''1999-2000''' - During the [[United States|American]] election campaign of [[2000]], Rick Mercer approached [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] presidential candidate [[George W. Bush]] on a campaign stop in [[Michigan]], asking for comment on the news that Bush had received the endorsement of Canadian [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]] "Jean [[Poutine]]". (The then-prime minister's name was [[Jean Chr<U+00E9>tien]], and he had not endorsed Bush per the policy of not endorsing anyone.)

Bush accepted the endorsement with a short and grateful speech to the ''22 Minutes'' cameras, which aired as part of the show's regular ''[[Talking to Americans]]'' feature. In his first official visit to Canada four years later, he joked that his "one regret" about the visit was that he'd "hoped to meet Jean Poutine." [http://www2.stephenville.org/bush.mpg View the clip]

===Stockwell/Doris petition===

'''2000-01''' - Often cited as the show's best joke, the sketch was aired during the [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 federal election campaign]], and consisted of a staged rant by Rick Mercer.

When former [[Canadian Alliance]] leader [[Stockwell Day]] ran for [[Prime Minister of Canada]], he proposed a mechanism to call for a [[referendum]]. A petition on any particular subject which gathered at least 350,000 signatures of voting age citizens ("3% of the electors") would automatically trigger a national referendum. 

Mercer's "rant" asked viewers to log on to the ''22 Minutes'' website, and sign an online petition asking the party leader to change his name to [[Doris Day]] (after the singer/actress). Producers claim to have obtained in excess of 1,200,000 online votes. This was cheerfully admitted to be a stunt unhampered by the rigours of an Elections Canada-controlled petition. Although the skit had no effect on Alliance policy, it did obtain international publicity for the show and contributed to the general air of farce surrounding Day's election campaign. Day did, however, have a very appropriate response to the petition: ''"[[Whatever Will Be, Will Be (Que Sera, Sera)|Que ser<U+00E1>, ser<U+00E1>]]."''

===Oilers vs Canadiens===

[[Image:TV_22_minutes_oilers.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Raj Binder ([[Shaun Majumder]]) at the old timers game]]
'''2003-04''' - Shaun Majumder (as "Raj Binder," bottom left corner) was sent to report on the 2003 outdoors [[Edmonton Oilers]] and [[Montreal Canadiens]] old timers game, preceding the night's actual [[National Hockey League|NHL]] regular season game, which was the first NHL game to be played outdoors (at [[Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)|Commonwealth Stadium]] in Edmonton). Raj actually sneaked into all the team photos, causing uproar from the event's unwitting organizers in the days after, when the photos were released to the press.
