The '''Rove Formation''' is located in the upper northeastern part of [[Cook County, Minnesota]], United States, and extends into [[Ontario]], Canada. It is the youngest of the many Animikie layers, a layer of sedimentary rocks.

Before the Rove sediments were laid down, during the the [[Archean Eon]], the [[Algoman Orogeny]] added landmass along a border from South Dakota to the Lake Huron region; this boundary is the [[Great Lakes Tectonic Zone]]. Several million years later a thin layer of hypervelocity impact ejecta from the Sudbury impact event was deposited between the Rove and the older, underlying, [[Gunflint Chert|Gunflint Iron Formation]]; it is estimated that at ground zero the earthquake generated by the meteor impact would have registered 10.2 on the [[Richter scale]]. 

During the Middle [[Precambrian]] a shallow inland sea covered much of the [[Lake Superior]] region and formed the [[Animikie Group]], layers of [[sedimentary rocks]] overlying 2,700-million-year-old Archean rocks. The Rove Formation is the youngest of the many Animikie layers.

After the Rove sediments were deposited, the [[Penokean orogeny|Penokean Orogeny]] added more land mass by accretion that occurred from the south. A few hundred million years later the proto-North American continent nearly split in half along the Midcontinent Rift Zone, which is a bow-shaped rift extending from northeast Kansas, arcing through the present-day Lake Superior basin and then angling southeast through Michigan. Then came a period of advancing and retreating glaciers. The more resistant [[diabase]] [[Sill (geology)|sills]] and [[Dike (geology)|dikes]] remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers. The north path of glaciation is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges.

As a result of erosion of [[sandstone]] and the erosion-resistant sills and dikes, the topography in Minnesota has repeated parallel hills and valleys. The tightly packed lakes in the narrow valleys are long and narrow, and they orient from the east to west. The cliffs in these narrow valleys are the habitat to several rare plants which prefer living in narrow cliff areas in a [[sub-Arctic]] climate. In Ontario the Rove Formation is overlain by a thick diabase cap.

To put the Sudbury meteorite impact in perspective, the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub Impact]] on the Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula occurred {{mya|650|million years ago}}; the results of this impact caused the worldwide extinction of many species (including dinasaurs).<ref name=show/> 

The larger Sudbury impact would have also had global ramifications;<ref name=show/> it is conjectured that this caused the end of the iron deposits.

====Midcontinent Rift====
The Midcontinent Rift (also known as the Keewenawan Rift) began about {{mya|1100|million years ago}}; it lasted for about 20 million years. After the Penokean Mountains had eroded away, the proto-North American continent nearly split in half along this rift zone. The {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}} bow-shaped rift extended from northeast Kansas, through the southeast corner of Nebraska, diagonally northeast through Iowa, through Minnesota along the current Minnesota-Wisconsin border, arced through the present-day Lake Superior basin and angled southeast through Michigan.<ref name=michigan/> 

The Midcontinent Rift is the largest-known [[rift|continental rift]] in the world. The rift began as a [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spot]] of basaltic magma underneath the Lake Superior region; it extruded layers of lava up to {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} thick and extending up to {{convert|100|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} on either side of the rift. The deposited lava along the North Shore of Lake Superior is {{convert|7620|m|mi|0|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=Pavement/> 

This was a fast-spreading rift; the resulting basalts show little interaction with the then-existing rock.<!--Kim Woodbury cited "Early history of the Midcontinent Rift inferred from geochemistry and sedimentology of the Mesoproterozoic Osler Group, northwestern Ontario" by Pete Hollings, Philip Fralick, and Brian Cousens, in the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences 44(3): 389<U+2013>412 (2007),doi:10.1139/E06-084,<U+00A9> 2007 NRC Canada--> These immense volumes of [[mafic]] lava were generated in two major pulses, mostly via a hot [[mantle plume]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Mesoproterozoic Midcontinent Rift System, Lake Superior Region, USA|author1=Ojakangas, R.W.|author2=Morey, G.B.|author3=Green, J.C.|journal=Sedimentary Geology|volume=141-142|date=June 2001|pages=421<U+2013>442|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V6X-436N4CX-M&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=2aeeab5d2f46d23bc454bf9b3f967422|doi=10.1016/S0037-0738(01)00085-9|accessdate=March 29, 2010}}</ref> Along the North Shore of Lake Superior, one can see the solidified lava (igneous rock) most everywhere.<!--The orginal author of this piece lives on the North Shore.--> In the Rove region the magma didn't reach the surface; it intruded into fractures in the formation and slowly cooled to become diabase (rather than [[basalt]]). These solidified bodies are the [[Pigeon River (Minnesota-Ontario)|Pigeon River]] and [[Logan Intrusion]] diabases. 

The continent didn't split into two because the Grenville Province (a microcontinent) was converging with the proto-North American continent to the east. This convergence applied compressional forces to the rift, preventing the complete splitting apart of the proto-North American continent.

This rift was the last of volcanic or mountain-building activity in present-day Minnesota. The solidified lava flows have sagged, tilted and faulted; this created a basin up to {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep along the rift zone. Proto-Lake Superior filled the basin.

===Quaternary Period and glaciation===

The [[Quaternary]] Period began about {{mya|2|million years ago}} and continues today. This is the period of advancing and retreating [[glacier]]s. The Rove region has multiple tilted layers of volcanic rocks and easily eroded shale. The more resistant diabase dikes and sills remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers. These former shale valleys filled with water, forming the many lakes in the region. The character of the slates made them especially well suited for [[Glacier#Glacial geology|glacial quarrying]], much more so than the contiguous sills.<ref name=lakes/>{{rp|28}} A [[cuesta]] &ndash; a ridge formed by gently tilted sedimentary rock layers &ndash; topography had developed and was dominated by major east-west valleys with a few pronounced gaps in the intervening ridges.<ref name=lakes/>{{rp|28}}

The [[Last glacial period#Wisconsin glaciation, in North America|Rainy Lobe]] of the Wisconsin Glaciation was the most recent of the glaciation events, and it retreated about 10,000&nbsp;years ago. Glacial scratches and grooves in Rove rocks indicate a north or somewhat east-of-north glacial movement.<ref name=lakes/>{{rp|26}} This direction is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges.<ref name=lakes/>{{rp|26}} The lakes in the Rove Formation area are unique from other well-known linear bedrock lakes in North America because their long axes lie transverse to the general movement of the glaciers.<ref name=lakes/>{{rp|27}}

The weight of the ice sheet compressed the land and created depressions.<ref name=lakehead/> As the glacier retreated, the weight and pressure were relieved from the surface of the land and the land rebounded;<ref name=lakehead/> the [[Glacier#Isostatic rebound|rebound]] process continues, and is estimated to be {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=lakehead/>

[[File:Grand Portage route.JPG|thumb|left|alt= This is a topographic map of the extreme northeastern tip of Minnesota. The green line shows the route the voyageurs took on their Grand Portage.|The green dotted line shows the route of the Grand Portage that the voyaguers followed.]]

The [[Pigeon River (Minnesota<U+2013>Ontario)|Pigeon River]] forms the border between Minnesota and Ontario in this area. The first {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the river is crooked, swift, interrupted by rapids and falls, and flows in places through a steep-walled canyon. The High Falls are {{convert|37|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} high and presents an impassable obstacle to river travel. The Cascade Falls are further up the river. The soft shale erodes easily, leaving the Logan and [[Pigeon River diabase]]s which create the waterfalls and cascades.

A [[portage]] was necessary from the shore of Lake Superior past the High Falls. Southwest of the mouth of the Pigeon River is Grand Portage Bay; about {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} inland there is a gap through the surrounding hills and bluffs which provides a gradual ascent to Cascade Falls. The river is navigable by canoe beyond the Cascade Falls. The Sioux and Chippewa created a {{convert|14.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} long portage from [[Grand Portage National Monument#The Grand Portage|Grand Portage Bay]] to bypass the three falls and several kilometers of turbulent river<ref name=ojakangas>{{cite book|title=Minnesota's Geology|author1=Ojakangas, Richard W.|author2=Matsch, Charles L.|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1982|isbn=0-8166-0950-0}}</ref>{{rp|175}} up to the Cascade Falls, probably by following animal trails. The French called this trail the Great Portage because it was so long.

The first-known non-native visitors were French-speaking people from France and eastern Canada who started to explore the area in about 1655. They were looking for the [[Northwest Passage]] and to trade for furs, particularly [[Beaver#Trapping|beaver pelts]]. Beaver pelts were in demand for European fashion during the 17th and 18th centuries. The Grand Portage was on the major [[North American fur trade|fur trade]] route of the 1700s and was the first of more than 40 portages along the fur trade route.<ref name=ojakangas/>{{rp|175}} The French-Canadian [[coureur des bois|voyageurs]] would carry two {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}} packs from the main storage depot at Grand Portage Bay along the trail to their smaller storage depot at Fort Charlotte; it took a few hours. In 1784 Grand Portage Bay became the headquarters for the [[North West Company]]. The post was abandoned in 1803 when the North West Company moved north.

In Ontario the shales and greywackes from the Animikie Group in the Rove Formation are overlain by a {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} cap of diabase.<ref name=lakehead/>{{rp|22}} This diabase cap a sill remnant, and most of the diabase is covered by a considerable thickness of mineral soil.<ref name=lakehead/>{{rp|22}} The [[mesa]] at Russell Point [about {{convert|16|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Thunder Bay]]] is a Logan Sill of diabase over the softer Rove Formation metasediments.<ref name=lakehead/>{{rp|79}} It is one of the many flat-topped, steep-sided mesas along Lake Superior's northwestern shore south of Thunder Bay that are collectively known as the [[Nor'Wester Mountains]].<ref name=lakehead/>{{rp|79}}

In Minnesota the Rove Formation area shows an interesting relationship of bedrock to topography<ref name=lakes>{{cite book|title=The Lakes of Minnesota, Their Origin and Classification, Bulletin 35|author=Zumberge, James H|publisher=University of Minnesota Geological Survey, GM Schwartz, director|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1952}}</ref>{{rp|24}} with its valley-and-ridge landscape.<ref name=topography/> There are several series of steep, east-west oriented valleys which were created by the erosion of the exposed shale.<ref name=laurentiana/> The diabase-capped ridges between the valleys slope gently to the south (4<U+00B0>&nbsp;to&nbsp;15<U+00B0> from the horizontal);<ref name=lakes/>{{rp|24}} the northern faces are precipitous, they rise {{convert|60|to|140|m|ft|abbr=on}} above deep, cold lakes, creating an asymmetrical cross-section profile.<ref name=laurentiana/> The asymmetrical cross section of the ridges is the result of bands of massive, poorly-jointed rock alternating with highly-jointed rock units.<ref name=topography>{{cite journal|title=Glacial Erosion in Tilted Rock Layers|author=Zumberge, James H.|journal=The Journal of Geology|volume=63|number=2|date=March 1955|page=149|publisher=The University of Chigaco Press|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/30080875|accessdate March 30, 2010}}</ref> The valleys contain glacially quarried bedrock lakes; they are also asymmetrical in cross section because of the same structural elements which control the ridge shapes.<ref name=topography/> Most of the lakes show an asymmetrical bottom configuration,<ref name=lakes/>{{rp|26}} showing a steep subaqueous slope on the south shore.<ref name=lakes/>{{rp|30}} The northern-facing cliffs provide the habitat for a few species of endangered flora.<ref name=laurentiana/> The Rove Formation has landscape features that are not found elsewhere in Minnesota.<ref name=laurentiana/>

Most of the valleys are occupied by chains of elongate lakes, many of which are bordered by solid rock on all sides.<ref name=lakes/>{{rp|24}} Many of the east-west valleys terminate abruptly at either one or both ends when the bordering sills merge together.<ref name=lakes/>{{rp|29}} The elevation of the lakes range from Rose Lake's {{convert|465|m|ft|abbr=on}} to Loon Lake's {{convert|532|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.<ref name=lakes/>{{rp|24}} Lakes on the opposite sides of a single ridge may differ in surface elevation by as much as {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=lakes/>{{rp|24}} Many of the rock-bound lakes have a depth of about {{convert|30|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}; a few are deeper than {{convert|61|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=lakes/>{{rp|26}}
 
A topographic map shows that the majority of the interconnected complex of tightly packed lakes with their valley-and-ridge landscape is primarily in Minnesota; the border of the landscape is the Minnesota-Canadian border.<ref name=lake-link/> This border is composed of the Pigeon River, and these Rove Formation lakes (going east to west): South Fowl, North Fowl, Moose, Mountain, Watap, Rose, South, Little North and Gunflint.<ref name=lake-link>{{cite map|url=http://www.lake-link.com/maps/lake.cfm?LakeID=7191&View=Area_Map|title=South Fowl Lake Area Map|publisher=Lake-Link|page=1|accessdate=March 26, 2010}}</ref> The border runs approximately through the center of the lengths of these lakes.<ref name=lake-link/> The only Rove-typical east-west oriented lakes that lie in Ontario are Arrow and North lakes.

The preglacial [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage pattern]] was controlled by the rock structure.<ref name=lakes/>{{rp|26}} Ver Steeg reconstructed a preglacial drainage pattern that shows major streams flowing east in the slate belts.<ref name=lakes/>{{rp|26}} Short tributaries and short north-south segments of the major streams cut across ridges which formed small gaps that are still present.<ref name=lakes/>{{rp|27}} 

The [[Laurentian Divide|Laurentian Continental Divide]] is within the formation. Between North Lake, Ontario, and South Lake, Minnesota, is a low saddle of land right on the border; this is the divide.<ref>{{cite report|title=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources ToMo map of Grand Portage National Park|publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, State Parks, ToMo|url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/maps/tomo.html?col=138&row=52&layer=100k&size=7|accessdate=April 3, 2101}}</ref> North Lake drains into the Rainy River and then to Hudson Bay. South Lake drains into the Pigeon River and then to Lake Superior. 
 
Topsoils are thin and poor because the glaciers had abraded down to the bedrock. The soils are clayey silt.<ref name=nhic/>
