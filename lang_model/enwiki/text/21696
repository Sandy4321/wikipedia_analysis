The '''Mont Park railway''' is a former branch line from the [[Hurstbridge railway line, Melbourne|Hurstbridge line]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. The main line connection was at the down (Melbourne) end of [[Macleod railway station, Melbourne|Macleod station]], with the line operating between 1911 and 1964.<ref name="nsw">[http://www.nswrail.net/library/bulletin_results.php?year=1982&searchmode=1 ARHS Bulletin Search Results]</ref>

==History==
The line was opened in 1911 to serve the [[Mont Park Asylum, Melbourne|Mont Park Asylum]] complex, with the construction expense met by the government Health Department.<ref name="elect">{{cite book

The 'Railway (Mont Park Siding)' Act of 1946 was passed to permit passenger trains to operate on the line, but this opportunity was never used.<ref name="elect" /> The Act was later amended in 1958 for unknown reasons.<ref>Victorian [http://www.dms.dpc.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubLawToday.nsf/a12f6f60fbd56800ca256de500201e54/84de34cd4eb62642ca256e5b000372fd/$FILE/58-6188a011doc.doc Acts Enumeration and Revision Act 1958]</ref>

The line was officially closed on June 30, 1964.<ref name="elect" />

==Operation==
The line was built as a single track goods only line. It was built to a 1 in 30 grade, and was unfenced. At the terminus there were three roads in 1953, with a derail block at the  Down (exit) end.<ref name="vr">[[Victorian Railways]] ''General Appendix to the Book of Rules and Regulations and to the Working Timetable'' 1953</ref> Trains were running weekly on the line by the 1950s, run either with the 'Electric Motors' (suburban carriages) from Heidelberg,<ref name="vr" /> or the [[Victorian_Railways_E_class_electric|E]] and [[Victorian_Railways_L_class_electric|L]] class electric locomotives.<ref name="elect" />

The [[Staff and Ticket]] safeworking system was used on the line, but with no tickets to be issued due to the lack of crossing places or signalling staff at the terminus. Staff locked points were provided at the main line junction.<ref name="vr" /> In 1953 the main line was using the [[Electric Staff]] safeworking system, so a special procedure was required.<ref name="vr" /> A freight train would be despatched from Heidelberg with the 'Heidelberg to Macleod' train staff. The train then proceeded to the junction, where it would be met by the signaller from Macleod carrying the 'Macleod to Mont Park' train staff. The train staffs would be exchanged, the 'Heidelberg to Macleod' staff used to unlock the points so they could be set for the diverge, and the train allowed to proceed to Mont Park with the 'Macleod to Mont Park' staff. The signaller then reset the points to the main line, and returned the 'Heidelberg to Macleod' staff to the staff instrument to allow another train to use the main line. On the return from Mont Park the reverse procedure was carried out.

This complicated manoeuvre was simplified from 1955, when the staff lock on the main line junction points were replaced with a connection to the [[lever frame]] in the [[signal box]] at Macleod.<ref>[[Victorian Railways]] signal diagram: [http://www.victorianrailways.net/signaling/completedia/macleod1955.html Macleod station 1955]</ref> In December 1958 [[Electric Staff]] safeworking on the mainline was replaced by 3 position automatic signals, and duplication was carried out from Rosanna Junction to Macleod.<ref>[[Victorian Railways]] signal diagram: [http://www.victorianrailways.net/signaling/completedia/wesmacdia.html Westgarth to Macleod 1979]</ref>

==Today==
From 1966, 898 feet<ref>[[Victorian Railways]] signal diagram: [http://www.victorianrailways.net/signaling/completedia/heidmacdia.html Heidelberg to Macleod 1972]</ref> (300 metres) of line was kept for the stabling of trains, remaining until the late 1970s at the earliest.<ref name="elect" />  The remains of the line beyond this point was lifted in 1970<ref name="elect" /> by the [[Tramway Museum Society of Victoria]] for use on their own line, and shallow cuttings on the line were filled in by the landowner.<ref>[http://www.railpage.com.au/f-p322824.htm#322824 Railpage Australia: comment by user '''chairman''']</ref>

Approximately 100 metres of the line remains today for the stabling of trains. Land formerly occupied by the [[Mont Park Asylum, Melbourne|Mont Park Asylum]] is now part of [[La Trobe University]], and private housing developments.
