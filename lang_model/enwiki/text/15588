[[Lieutenant Colonel]] '''Oskar-Heinz (Heinrich) "Pritzl" B<U+00E4>r''' (21 March 1913 &ndash; 28 April 1957) was a [[Germans|German]] [[Luftwaffe]] [[flying ace]] who served throughout [[World War II]] in Europe. A flying ace or fighter ace is a [[military aviation|military aviator]] credited with shooting down five or more enemy [[aircraft]] during aerial combat.<ref>Spick 1996, pp. 3<U+2013>4.</ref> He flew over a thousand combat missions, and fought in all major German theatres of the war, including the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western]], [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern]] and [[Mediterranean theatre of World War II|Mediterranean]] fronts. On 18 occasions he survived being shot down, and he was credited with 220 aerial victories.{{ref label|Note1|a|a}}<ref>Schaulen 2003, p. 26.</ref>

B<U+00E4>r, a [[Saxony|Saxon]] with a strong accent, joined the [[Reichswehr]] in 1934 and transferred to the Luftwaffe in 1935. Serving first as a mechanic, then as a pilot on transport aircraft, he was informally trained as a fighter pilot. He claimed his first aerial victory in September 1939 on the French border. By the end of the [[Battle of Britain]], his tally of victories had increased to 17. Transferred to the Eastern front to participate in [[Operation Barbarossa]], he quickly accumulated further victories, a feat that earned him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen mit Eichenlaub and Schwertern'') for 90 aerial victories in February 1942.

During the remainder of World War II, B<U+00E4>r was credited with 130 other aerial victories, including 16 while flying one of the first jet fighters, the [[Me 262]], an achievement which would normally have earned him the coveted [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillianten)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillianten'').<ref name="Kurowski p122">Kurowski 1996, p. 122.</ref><ref>Toliver & Constable 1998, p. 360.</ref> However, [[Hermann G<U+00F6>ring]]'s personal dislike of B<U+00E4>r, coupled with B<U+00E4>r's insubordinate character and lack of military discipline, deprived him of this award.<ref name="Kurowski pp103-105">Kurowski 1996, pp. 103&ndash;105.</ref> After World War II, B<U+00E4>r continued his career as an aviator and was killed in a flying accident on 28 April 1957 near Braunschweig.

==Early life==
B<U+00E4>r was born in Sommerfeld near [[Leipzig]] on 25 May 1913. His parents were farmers and B<U+00E4>r initially wanted to become forester, for everything associated with wildlife and forests interested him. His first sight of a [[Junkers]] transport aircraft changed his mind and convinced him that he should become an aviator.<ref>Kurowski 1996, p. 73.</ref> As a teenager, he became a glider pilot and had ambitions to become an airline pilot with [[Lufthansa]].<ref name="Toliver Constable p358">Toliver & Constable 1998, p. 358.</ref> He acquired the nickname ''Pritzl'' because of his affection for Pritzl candy bars.<ref>Bergstr<U+00F6>m & Mikhailov 2000, p. 86.</ref>

The [[Great Depression]] prevented B<U+00E4>r from gaining a civil pilot license. In 1934, he joined the [[Reichswehr]] and was assigned to the ''Kraftfahrabteilung 4'' as a mechanic. He served in this position until the following year, when he was transferred to a combat unit of the Luftwaffe. A few months later, he was accepted for pilot training, receiving his transport aircraft pilot's license in 1937. He was transferred to I./Jagdgeschwader 135, the core of the future [[Jagdgeschwader 51]] (JG 51), on 1 September 1938, usually flying the [[Junkers Ju 86]].{{ref label|Note2|b|b}}<ref name="Toliver Constable p358"/> The [[Squadron Leader]] (''[[Staffelkapit<U+00E4>n]]'') Douglas Pitcairn noticed B<U+00E4>r<U+2019>s flying talents and tried to convince B<U+00E4>r to become a fighter pilot. Initially B<U+00E4>r refused, but after he illegally conducted some [[aerobatics]] in the Ju 86 leading to an engine failure, he reluctantly accepted and became a fighter pilot.<ref>Aders & Held 1993, pp. 29,30.</ref><ref name="Toliver Constable p359">Toliver & Constable 1998, p. 359.</ref>

==World War II==
Stationed on the border with France, B<U+00E4>r achieved his first victory&mdash;a [[Curtiss P-36]] 'Hawk'&mdash;on 25 September 1939 during the [[Phoney War]] air skirmishes with the [[History of the Arm<U+00E9>e de l'Air (1909<U+2013>1942)|''Arm<U+00E9>e de l'Air'']] (French air force), earning him the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class on 27 September 1939.<ref name="Aders&Held p47">Aders & Held 1993, p. 47.</ref> During the [[Battle of France]], he is credited with two more aerial victories before adding a further ten during the [[Battle of Britain]]. During this time, he had several emergency landings with badly damaged planes and was shot down over the [[English Channel]] on 2 September 1940 by a [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]. Hermann G<U+00F6>ring later questioned B<U+00E4>r about this aerial battle.{{ref label|Note3|c|c}} B<U+00E4>r was summoned to G<U+00F6>ring and asked what he was thinking about while in the water. B<U+00E4>r immediately replied, "Your speech, Herr ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' that England is no longer an island![sic]", eluding to a speech that G<U+00F6>ring had held before the German fighter pilots.<ref name="Spick p219">Spick 1996, p. 219.</ref> Incidents like this are testimony to his often blatant disregard for higher authority, a trait that would frequently land the young ace in trouble.<ref name="Kurowski pp103-105"/> In the spring of 1941, he is credited with an additional four aerial victories against the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), bringing his total to 17.<ref name="Spick p219"/><ref name="Berger p13">Berger 1999, p. 13.</ref>

===Eastern front===
In June 1941, JG 51 was transferred East to take part in [[Operation Barbarossa]]. JG 51 at the time was part of the II. ''Fliegerkorps'', operating in the central sector of the [[Eastern Front (World War 2)|Eastern front]]. B<U+00E4>r claimed five aerial victories on 30 June 1941, bringing his total to 22.<ref>Bergstr<U+00F6>m & Mikhailov 2000, p. 61.</ref> On this day JG 51 was credited with 113 aerial victories in total, among them their 1,000th aerial victory&mdash;the first unit to reach this figure&mdash;and [[Colonel]] (''[[Oberst]]'') [[Werner M<U+00F6>lders]], with 82 aerial victories, surpassed [[Manfred von Richthofen]] in number of victories.<ref>Aders & Held 1993, p. 90</ref><ref>Weal 2001, p. 22.</ref> Within two weeks of combat against the [[Soviet Air Force]], B<U+00E4>r's tally rose to 27, which earned him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes'') on 2 July, followed by his promotion to [[First Lieutenant]] (''[[Oberleutnant]]'') on 1 August 1941. On 14 August, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves (mit Eichenlaub)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub'') for 60 victories, and on 30 August he became an "ace in one day" by shooting down six Soviet aircraft. On 31 August, B<U+00E4>r was shot down some {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} behind Soviet lines, near [[Novgorod]]-Seversky. Bailing out, he suffered back injuries, but managed to walk back to German lines; his wounds necessitated a lengthy hospital treatment.<ref>Kurowski 1996, pp. 83<U+2013>87.</ref>

B<U+00E4>r was promoted to [[Captain (United States uniformed services)|Captain]] (''[[Hauptmann]]'') in the fall of 1941 and appointed Squadron Leader of 12./JG 51 in early 1942. He received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern'') on 16 February as his tally rose to 90. This achievement was mentioned in the daily ''[[Wehrmachtbericht]]'' (daily report by the High Command of the German Armed Forces regarding the military situation on all fronts) on 12 February 1942, his first of three references during the course of the war. On 11 May, B<U+00E4>r was transferred from IV./JG 51 on the Moscow front to take command of I. ''Gruppe'' of [[Gordon Gollob]]'s [[Jagdgeschwader 77]] (JG 77) flying wing; JG 77 was tasked with supporting the hard fighting over the [[Kerch]] straits on the [[Crimean]] peninsula. Led by the [[flying ace]]s (''Experten'') Gollob and B<U+00E4>r, JG 77 took over the air space above Kerch-Taman as Gollob and B<U+00E4>r shot down two and three [[Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov LaGG-3|LaGG-3s]] respectively, raising B<U+00E4>r's victory total to 93.<ref name="Bergstr<U+00F6>m & Mikhailov p159">Bergstr<U+00F6>m & Mikhailov 2001, p. 159.</ref> Mutual animosity between the two aces, Gollob, a disciplinarian pro-Nazi, and B<U+00E4>r, an anti-authoritarian, ensured an intense rivalry.<ref name="Bergstr<U+00F6>m & Mikhailov p159"/> On 19 May 1942, B<U+00E4>r claimed five further aerial victories; his victory total now stood at 103. That same day, [[Inspector of Fighters]] (''General der Jagdflieger'') [[Adolf Galland]] arrived to inspect B<U+00E4>r's I./JG 77 and JG 77 surpassed 2,000 victories.<ref>Bergstr<U+00F6>m & Mikhailov 2001, p. 160.</ref><ref>Kurowski 1996, p. 92.</ref> This flying achievement earned B<U+00E4>r a second mention in the daily ''Wehrmachtbericht'' on 20 May 1942.

===Mediterranean theatre===
In June 1942, JG 77 was moved to the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean theatre of operation]] and took part in the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|air battles over Malta]] before relocating to [[Tunisia]] and participating in the [[North African Campaign]]. After B<U+00E4>r achieved his 149th aerial victory, General [[Hans-J<U+00FC>rgen von Arnim]] submitted him for the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillianten)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillianten''). ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' [[Hermann G<U+00F6>ring]] ignored this request, denying B<U+00E4>r the "Diamonds". The reason for this remains uncertain, but it is believed that G<U+00F6>ring disliked B<U+00E4>r for his insubordinate character and strong [[German dialects#Low Saxon|Low Saxon]] dialect, which G<U+00F6>ring was known to detest.<ref>Kurowski 1996, p. 96.</ref> 

B<U+00E4>r and his I. Gruppe of JG 77 operated from [[Fatnassa, Tunisia]] in early March 1943. On 1 March, B<U+00E4>r claimed a Spitfire shot down, then in the evening met Galland, who was making a surprise visit to I./JG 77. Galland was greeted by ''[[Major]]'' [[Joachim M<U+00FC>ncheberg]], who introduced B<U+00E4>r to Galland. Thus began a comradeship which outlasted World War II.<ref>Kurowski 2007, p. 70.</ref>

Over North Africa and the Mediterranean theatre, B<U+00E4>r had increased his tally to 179, but, fighting a losing battle against ever-increasing Allied air superiority, B<U+00E4>r lost his fighting spirit, and suffered severe mental and physical exhaustion. After several arguments with JG 77's new Commander Colonel [[Johannes Steinhoff]] and [[Hermann G<U+00F6>ring]], in the summer of 1943 B<U+00E4>r  was transferred to France "for cowardice before the enemy" and demoted to Squadron Leader. He took over command of an operational training unit, [[Jagdgruppe S<U+00FC>d]].<ref name="Berger p14">Berger 1999, p. 14.</ref><ref name="Donaldcaldwell p153">Caldwell & Muller 2007, p. 153.</ref>

===Defense of the Reich===

His combat skills were hard to overlook and hence B<U+00E4>r was transferred to II./[[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War 2)|Jagdgeschwader 1]] (JG 1) on 21 January 1944 as an ordinary pilot. He was assigned to 6./JG 1. Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG 1) [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] (''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'') Colonel [[Walter Oesau]] welcomed him with a reminder that he had promised [[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]] (OKL) G<U+00F6>ring that B<U+00E4>r would not be given any command responsibilities. Although B<U+00E4>r accepted this with humor, he later commented to others that in the air he was the "Kommodore of his own crate".<ref name="Donaldcaldwell p153"/><ref name =Schuelke>Schuelke (1995).</ref> 

On 15 March 1944, B<U+00E4>r, now a ''Major'' and rehabilitated from the demotion, was given command of II./Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG 1). This was after the death of Hauptmann Hermann Segatz on 8 March 1944. JG 1 was tasked with ''Reichsverteidigung'' ([[Defense of the Reich]]) and equipped with the [[Focke-Wulf 190|Focke Wulf 190 A-7]] fighter. Morale of the group soared following his appointment. He was considered the unofficial leader of the group and the best officer in the entire ''Geschwader''.<ref>Kurowski 1996, p. 107.</ref> This effectively completed his formal rehabilitation from the prior year's demotion. On 11 April 1944, B<U+00E4>r achieved his 199th aerial victory over a [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] near [[Fallersleben]]. His 200th aerial victory, a [[B-24 Liberator]], was claimed on 22 April accompanied by his regular wingman [[Warrant Officer]] (''[[Oberfeldwebel]]'') [[Leo Schuhmacher]], who would be awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 1 March 1945 as a fighter pilot in II./JG 1.<ref name="Weal p55"/><ref>Scherzer 2007, p. 688.</ref> B<U+00E4>r had just landed at St<U+00F6>rmede airfield from a II./JG 1 intercept when the smoking [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) B-24 of the [[458th Bombardment Group]] passed overhead. B<U+00E4>r and his wingman quickly got into their aircrafts and intercepted the B-24. The bomber's gunners had already bailed out of the aircraft, making it an easy aerial victory.<ref>Caldwell & Muller 2007, p. 185.</ref> B<U+00E4>r returned to St<U+00F6>rmede airfield to the congratulations of his men. This double century victory would earn B<U+00E4>r his third and final reference in the ''Wehrmachtberich'' on 24 April 1944. After Oesau's death on 11 May 1944, B<U+00E4>r was made acting Wing Commander of JG 1. In June, he was appointed Wing Commander of [[Jagdgeschwader 3]] (JG 3) following the death of [[Friedrich-Karl "Nasen" M<U+00FC>ller|Friedrich-Karl M<U+00FC>ller]]. By the end of 1944, B<U+00E4>r's score had risen to 203.<ref name="Berger p14"/><ref>Caldwell & Muller 2007, pp. 170&ndash;202.</ref> 

B<U+00E4>r's 204th and 205th victories, against two [[Hawker Typhoon|Typhoon]]s, were achieved on 1 January 1945 during ''[[Unternehmen Bodenplatte]]'', a Luftwaffe mass attack against Allied airfields in the [[Benelux]] area. The operation resulted in hundreds of aircraft losses on both sides. B<U+00E4>r's JG 3 contributed by raiding [[Eindhoven]] in the Netherlands, shooting down about 6 RAF fighters and destroying many aircraft on the ground.<ref name="Berger p14"/><ref>Girbig 1997, p. 172.</ref>

===Combat in the Me 262===
In February, B<U+00E4>r was transferred to command the [[Fighter aircraft|jet fighter]] training unit III./[[Erg<U+00E4>nzungsjagdgeschwader|Erg<U+00E4>nzungsjagdgeschwader 2]] (EJG 2). In March, the unit was equipped with the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] fighter and sent into battle. B<U+00E4>r shot down 13 enemy aircraft, many of them heavy bombers like the [[Boeing B-17]] and the [[B-24|Consolidated B-24 Liberator]], bringing his score to 217. On 23 April, B<U+00E4>r transferred to the elite ''Jet Experten'' unit [[Jagdverband 44]] (JV 44), led by [[Adolf Galland]]. On 26 April, he assumed command of the unit when Galland was wounded. B<U+00E4>r possibly flew his first operational sortie with JV 44 on 27 April 1945. Flying the Me 262 A-1/U5, a six [[MK 108 cannon]] prototype, he was accompanied by ''Major'' [[Wilhelm Herget]] and the [[non-commissioned officer]] NCO (''[[Unteroffizier]]'') [[Franz K<U+00F6>ster]] when the trio engaged American fighters over [[Riem]]; B<U+00E4>r claimed one aerial victory.<ref> Forsyth 2008, p. 93.</ref> While not flying operationally, B<U+00E4>r spent most of his time giving hasty instruction to the new pilots still being assigned to JV 44.<ref> Forsyth 2008, p. 94.</ref> With JV 44, he achieved his final four aerial victories (3 [[P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47s]] and 1 [[De Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]]) on 28 April,<ref>Caldwell & Muller 2007, pp. 284&ndash;285.</ref> bringing his total to 220. All told, he had achieved 16 victories in the Me 262, making him the second most successful ''Jet Expert'' of the war, which he finished as a [[Lieutenant Colonel]] (''[[Oberstleutnant]]'').{{ref label|Note4|d|d}}<ref>Kurowski 1996, pp. 117<U+2013>121.</ref>

During the final days of the Second World War in Europe, [[Lieutenant General]] (''Generalleutnant'') Adolf Galland attempted to surrender JV 44 to American forces from his hospital bed.<ref>Forsyth 2008, pp. 111, 112.</ref> At the same time [[General officer|Air General]] (''General der Flieger'') [[Karl Koller (general)|Karl Koller]] had ordered JV 44 to relocate to [[Prague]] and continue fighting. B<U+00E4>r, as a Galland loyalist, attempted to ignore the order. B<U+00E4>r was further pressured to relocate JV 44 when [[Major General]] (''[[Generalmajor]]'') [[Dietrich Peltz]], commander of [[IX. Fliegerkorps]], and Colonel [[Hajo Herrmann]], commander of [[9. Fliegerdivision]], unexpectedly emerged at the control room in [[Salzburg|Maxglan]] on 2 May 1945. A heated and violent dispute erupted between B<U+00E4>r, Peltz and Herrmann, witnessed by [[Walter Krupinski]]. He later recalled that B<U+00E4>r responded with "Yes, sir, but we are under the command of ''Generalleutnant'' Galland, and I will only follow orders of ''Generalleutnant'' Galland!"<U+2014>a final act of disobedience that Krupinski believed could have gotten B<U+00E4>r shot for insubordination.<ref>Forsyth 2008, pp. 115, 116.</ref>

In the early morning hours of 4 May 1945, B<U+00E4>r gathered the pilots of JV 44 for a final briefing. B<U+00E4>r ordered the remaining Me 262 destroyed before going into captivity and interrogation by US Intelligence officers of the 1st Tactical Air Force's Air Prisoner of War Interrogation Unit, based at [[Heidelberg]].<ref>Forsyth 2008, pp. 119, 120.</ref>

==After the war==
B<U+00E4>r did not return to his home in Sommerfeld after World War II. He settled in [[Braunschweig]], where he continued his career in aviation, including a lead position for motor powered flight with the ''Deutscher Aero Club''. He also worked as a consultant and [[test pilot]] in the field of sport aviation, testing aircraft before they went on the market. On 28 April 1957, while conducting a routine flight check in a light aircraft, a [[LF-1 Zaunk<U+00F6>nig]], B<U+00E4>r put the aircraft into a flat spin, the final manoeuvre in the test process. The aircraft spun down to {{convert|50|m|yd}}, where, unable to regain control, B<U+00E4>r was killed in the resulting crash at Braunschweig-Waggum.<ref name="Kurowski p122"/><ref name="Berger p14"/><ref name="Helden der Wehrmacht p148">Helden der Wehrmacht 2004, p. 148.</ref>

==Summary of career==
Heinrich B<U+00E4>r, [[call sign]] "Bussard 1", flew more than 1,000 combat missions. His 220 confirmed aerial victories place him eighth on the overall list of ''Experten''.{{ref label|Note1|a|a}}{{ref label|Note5|e|e}} His claim of 124 aerial victories over Western-flown aircraft is second only to [[Hans-Joachim Marseille]]'s total of 158; almost all of the latter's victories occurred in Africa. He achieved four victories during the [[Battle of France]], 13 during the [[Battle of Britain]] and 61 over [[Libya]] and [[Tunisia]]. On the Eastern front he had claimed 96 aerial victories. At least 75 of his victories had been claimed against British- and American-flown aircraft over Europe, 16 of these while flying the Me 262 jet fighter. Also among these 75 aerial victories are 21 US heavy bombers and one [[De Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]]. B<U+00E4>r crash-landed or bailed out 18 times and was wounded three times in combat.<ref name="Kurowski p122"/><ref name="Berger p14"/><ref>Kurowski 2007, p. 157.</ref><ref>Spick 1996, pp. 220, 227.</ref>

===Footnotes===
*{{note label|Note1|a|a}} Some sources claim he is credited with 220 aerial victories, but 221 seems to be correct based on his log-book and personal file. Sources that list him with 220 include ''Luftwaffe Fighter Aces'' by Mike Spick,<ref>Spick 1996, p. 227.</ref> ''German Jet Aces of World War 2'' by Hugh Morgan and John Weal.<ref>Morgan & Weal 1998, p. 88.</ref> Sources that list him with 221 aerial victories include ''Luftwaffe Aces'' by Franz Korowski.<ref name="Kurowski p122"/> However, such WWII air combat statistics [[Confirmation and overclaiming of aerial victories|are liable to dispute]].
