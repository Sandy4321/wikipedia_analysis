{{Intelligent Design}}
'''''A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism''''' (or '''''Dissent From Darwinism''''') is a statement issued in 2001 by the [[Discovery Institute]], a conservative non-profit public policy [[think tank]] based in [[Seattle, Washington]], [[USA]], best known for its advocacy of [[intelligent design]]. The statement expresses skepticism about the ability of [[Random_mutation#Mutation|random mutations]] and [[natural selection]] to account for the complexity of life, and encourages careful examination of the evidence for "[[Darwinism]]," a term intelligent design proponents use to refer to [[evolution]].<ref name="Forrest">{{cite web|author=Forrest B|pages=5 |url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/intelligent-design.pdf |title=UNDERSTANDING THE INTELLIGENT DESIGN CREATIONIST MOVEMENT: ITS TRUE NATURE AND GOALS|format= pdf|publisher=Center for Inquiry, Inc.|year=2007 |accessdate=25 April 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110519124655/http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/intelligent-design.pdf| archivedate= 19 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}.

On the scientific front of the much ballyhooed "Evolution Wars", the Darwinists were winning handily.

==Statement==
''A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism'' states that:

The statement, and its title, refer to [[evolution]] as "[[Darwinism]]" or "Darwinian theory", can lead to confusion, due to the terms having various meanings, but commonly meaning evolution due to the mechanism of [[natural selection]] rather than the broader definition of evolution, the change in a species' inherited traits from generation to generation.<ref name=Evans/> The terms have meant different things to different people at different times.<ref name=howto>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/anti-darwin.html |title=How to be Anti-Darwinian |author=John Wilkins |year=1998 |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |accessdate=31 July 2008}}</ref> In terms of the [[history of evolutionary thought]], both "Darwinism" and "neo-Darwinism" are predecessors of the current evolutionary theory, the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]].<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Pigliucci, M. | year = 2007 | title = Do We Need An Extended Evolutionary Synthesis? | journal = Evolution | volume = 61 | issue = 12 | pages = 2743<U+2013>2749 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00246.x | pmid = 17924956 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kutschera U, Niklas KJ |title=The modern theory of biological evolution: an expanded synthesis |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=255<U+2013>76 |year=2004 |pmid=15241603 | doi = 10.1007/s00114-004-0515-y}}</ref> However, in the context of the [[creation-evolution controversy]], the term "Darwinism" is commonly used by [[creationism|creationists]] to describe scientists and science teachers who oppose them,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.impactpress.com/articles/spring05/sullivanspring05.html |title=From the Beagle to the School Board &ndash; God Goes Back to School|publisher=IMPACT|author=Sullivan M|year=2005|work= |accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref> and to claim that scientific disagreements about the specific mechanism can be equated to rejection of evolution as a whole.

{{quote|Such a statement could easily be agreed to by scientists who have no doubts about evolution itself, but dispute the exclusiveness of "Darwinism," that is, natural selection, when other mechanisms such as genetic drift and gene flow are being actively debated.

==Responses==
The ''Scientific Dissent From Darwinism'' document has been widely criticized on several different grounds. First, similar to previous lists produced by other creationists, the professional expertise of those listed is not always apparent and is alleged to be deficient.<ref>See the criticism of other lists, especially of ''21 Scientists Who Believe in Creation'' and ''In Six Days: Why Fifty Scientists Choose to Believe in Creation'', described at [[level of support for evolution]], for example.</ref> Also, the professional affiliations and credentials that are claimed for some of the signatories has been questioned. Finally, there appear to be a few who appear on the list who are not firmly committed to the agenda advanced by the [[Discovery Institute]], and who have been misled into signing or who have changed their minds. Russell D. Renka, a [[political science|political scientist]], said that the Discovery Institute presented the list in an [[appeal to authority]] to support its anti-evolution viewpoint.<ref name=Renka>{{cite web |url=http://cstl-cla.semo.edu/Renka/Renka_papers/intell_design.htm |title=The Political Design of Intelligent Design |accessdate=25 August 2007 |author=Russell D.

A paper from a [[think tank]], the [[Center for Inquiry]] said that ''Dissent From Darwinism'' is one of the [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns]] to discredit evolution and bolster claims that intelligent design is scientifically valid by creating the impression that evolution lacks broad scientific support.<ref name="Forrest"/>

In November 2001, the National Center for Science Education stated that the then current version of the document appeared "to be very artfully phrased" to represent a diverse range of opinions, set in a context which gives it a misleading spin to confuse the public.<ref name=Evans/>

Critics have also noted that the wording and advertising of the original statement was, and remains, misleading,<ref name = Evans/> and that a review of the signatories suggested many doubt evolution due to religious, rather than scientific beliefs.<ref name = Chang/> Robert T. Pennock notes that rather than being a "broad dissent", the statement's wording is "very narrow, omitting any mention of the evolutionary thesis of common descent, human evolution or any of the elements of evolutionary theory except for the Darwinian mechanism, and even that was mentioned in a very limited and rather vague manner." He concludes that it is not in fact a "radical statement".<ref name="Pennock">{{cite book|title=Teaching about scientific origins: taking account of creationism|editor1=Jones, Leslie Sandra|editor2=Reiss, Michael Jonathan|author=Pennock, Robert T.|pages=66<U+2013>67|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8204-7080-1}}</ref>

The claims made for the importance of the list have also been called intellectually dishonest because it represents only a small fraction of the [[scientific community]], and includes an even smaller number of relevant experts.<ref name = Myers>{{cite web | url = http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/02/dr_michael_egnor_challenges_ev.php?utm_source=mostactive&utm_medium=link | title = Dr Michael Egnor challenges evolution! | last = Myers | first = PZ | authorlink =PZ Myers | publisher = [[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]] | date = 18 February 2007 | accessdate = 04 January 2008 }}</ref>  The Discovery Institute has responded to some of these criticisms.<ref>{{cite web | title = Time's Darwinist Thought-Cop Accuses Pro-ID Brain Surgeon of Committing "Intellectual Fraud | url = http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/02/times_magazines_darwinist_thou.html | last = Crowther | first = Robert | publisher = [[Discovery Institute]] | date = 16 February 2006 | accessdate = 04 January 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Predictable as Clockwork, the New York Times Misses The News In Reporting On Scientists Dissenting From Darwinism | url = http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/02/the_new_york_times_misses_the.html | last = Crowther | first = Robert | publisher = [[Discovery Institute]] | date = 21 February 2006 | accessdate = 04 January 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080126153201/http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/02/the_new_york_times_misses_the.html| archivedate= 26 January 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Affiliations and credentials===

[[Barbara Forrest]] and Glenn Branch say the Discovery Institute deliberately misrepresents the institutional affiliations of signatories of the statement ''A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism''. The institutions appearing in the list are the result of a conscious choice by the [[Discovery Institute]] to only present the most prestigious affiliations available for an individual. For example, if someone was trained at a more prestigious institution than the one they are presently affiliated with, the school they graduated from will more often be listed, without the distinction being made clear in the list. This is contrary to standard academic and professional practice and, according to Forrest and Branch, is deliberately misleading.<ref name=Forrest>{{cite web | url = http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/academe/2005/JF/Feat/forr.htm | title = Wedging Creationism into the Academy | authorlink = Barbara Forrest | last = Forrest | first = B | publisher = [[American Association of University Professors]] | date = 1 May 2005| accessdate = 12 July 2008}}</ref>

For example, the institutions listed for Raymond G. Bohlin, Fazale Rana, and [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]], were the [[University of Texas at Dallas]], [[Ohio University]], and the [[University of California, Berkeley]] respectively, the schools from which they obtained their Ph.D. degrees. However, their present affiliations are quite different: [[Probe Ministries]] for Bohlin, the [[Reasons to Believe Ministry]] for Rana, and the [[Discovery Institute]]'s [[Center for Science and Culture]] for Wells. Many of those who have signed the list are not currently active scientists, and some have never worked as scientists. Also, if a signatory was previously the head of a department or the president of an institute, their past and most prestigious position will be listed, not their current position.<ref name=Forrest />

Visitors at prestigious institutions will have that affiliation listed, not their more humble home institutions. For example, [[Bernard d'Abrera]], a writer and publisher of books on butterflies, appears on the list as "Visiting Scholar, Department of Entomology British Museum (Natural History)", in spite of the fact that this museum had become independent of the [[British Museum]] three decades previously and had formally changed its name to the [[Natural History Museum]] almost a decade before the petition. d'Abrera's primary affiliation is with his publishing company, Hill House Publishers. d'Abrera does not have a PhD either, nor any formal scientific qualification (his undergraduate degree was a double major in History & Philosophy of Science, and History), although creationists often call him "Dr. d'Abrera".{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The Discovery Institute currently recruits people with PhDs to sign the ''Dissent'' petition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dissentfromdarwin.org/sign_the_list.php |title=Sign - Dissent from Darwin |publisher=Discovery Institute |work= |accessdate=25 April 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110411085856/http://www.dissentfromdarwin.org/sign_the_list.php| archivedate= 11 April 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

At least one other signatory, [[Forrest Mims]], has neither a PhD nor any formal academic training in science. Additionally, at least seven signatories have their advanced degrees from outside the areas of "engineering, mathematics, computer science, biology, chemistry, or one of the other natural sciences" that are currently being recruited: Ronald R. Crawford has his Ed.D. in Science Education, [[David Berlinski]] has his PhD in Philosophy, Tom McMullen has his PhD in the History & Philosophy of Science, Angus Menuge has his PhD in the Philosophy of Psychology, and [[Stephen Meyer]] has his PhD in the Philosophy of Science; and at least six, [[Jeffrey M. Schwartz]], Ricardo Le<U+00F3>n Borquez (incorrectly listed as "Ricardo Leon"), Gage Blackstone, Daniel Galassini, Mary A. Brown and Thomas C. Majerus, have [[Doctorate#Professional doctorates|professional doctorates]] (such as an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], [[Veterinarian|DVM]] or [[Doctor of Pharmacy|PharmD]]), rather than holding a [[Doctorate#Research doctorates|research doctorate]] (such as a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Also, in early editions of the list, [[Richard Sternberg]] was described as "Richard Sternberg, Invertebrate Zoology, [[National Museum of Natural History]], [[Smithsonian Institution]]" though Sternberg was never a Smithsonian staff member, but an unpaid research associate.<ref name=advert/> At the time of signing the list Sternberg was the outgoing editor of the ''Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington'', a minor biology journal, where he played a central role in [[Sternberg peer review controversy|a peer-review controversy]]. Later versions of the list mention Sternberg's affiliation with Sternberg's ''alma maters'', [[Florida International University]] and [[State University of New York at Binghamton|Binghamton University]].<ref name="Discovery Institute"/> At present Sternberg is a Staff Scientist with [[GenBank]], the genetic database at the [[National Institutes of Health]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsternberg.net/CV.htm |title=Curriculum vitae of Dr. R. Sternberg |work= |accessdate=25 April 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110605082528/http://www.rsternberg.net/CV.htm| archivedate= 5 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Critics also say the Discovery Institute inflates the academic credentials and affiliations of signatories such as [[Henry F. Schaefer, III|Henry F. Schaefer]]. The institute prominently and frequently asserts that Schaefer has been nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].<ref name=advert/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=3076&program=CSC%20-%20Views%20and%20News |title=CSC - Intelligent Design &ndash; A Scientific, Academic and Philosophical Controversy |publisher=Discovery Institute|author= Weyrich PM|date=5 December 2005|work= |accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref> [[Barbara Forrest]] and others allege that the Discovery Institute is inflating his reputation by constantly referring to him as a "five-time nominee for the Nobel Prize" despite that Nobel Prize nominations remain confidential for fifty years<ref name=Forrest/> and there being about 250-300 nominations per prize per year.<ref name="urlNomination Facts">{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nomination/nomination_facts.html |title=Nomination Facts |publisher=Nobelprize.org |work= |accessdate=25 April 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110604112819/http://nobelprize.org/nomination/nomination_facts.html| archivedate= 4 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

By analysing the data for 34 British, or British-trained signatories of the ''Dissent'' list, the anti-creationist [[British Centre for Science Education]] raised doubts about the claimed affiliations and relevant expertise of those on the list.<ref name="urlBCSE">{{cite web |url=http://bcseweb.org.uk/index.php/Main/IntelligentDesignAdvocates |title=BCSE : Intelligent Design Advocates |publisher=British Centre for Science Education |work= |accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref>

===Defections and disagreements===

The [[National Center for Science Education]] interviewed a sample of the signatories, and found that some were less critical of "Darwinism" than the advertisement claimed.<ref name=Evans/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s798387.htm |title=Science Show: The Steve Project |date=3 August 2003|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|work= |accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref> It wrote to all of them asking whether they thought living things shared common ancestors and whether humans and apes shared common ancestors. According to [[Eugenie Scott]] of the NCSE, a few of the signatories replied saying that they did accept these principles but did not think that natural selection could explain the origins of life. However, the replies ceased when, according to Scott, the Discovery Institute found out and advised signatories not to respond. She concluded from this that "at least some of the more knowledgeable scientists did not interpret this statement the way that it was intended [by the Discovery Institute] to be interpreted by the general public."<ref name="Pennock" />

For example, Stanley N. Salthe, a visiting scientist at [[Binghamton University]], [[State University of New York]], who signed but describes himself as an [[atheist]], said that when he endorsed a [[petition]] he had no idea what the [[Discovery Institute]] was. Salthe stated, "I signed it in irritation", and said that evolutionary biologists were being unfair in suppressing competing ideas. He said that "They deserve to be prodded, as it were. It was my way of thumbing my nose at them", but was unconvinced by intelligent design and concluded "From my point of view, it's a plague on both your houses".<ref name="Chang"/>

At least one signatory of ''A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism'' has abandoned the list, saying he felt misled. Robert C. Davidson, a Christian, scientist, doctor, and retired [[nephrology]] professor at the [[University of Washington]] medical school said after having signed he was shocked when he discovered that the Discovery Institute was calling evolution a "theory in crisis". "It's laughable: There have been millions of experiments over more than a century that support evolution," said Davidson. "There's always questions being asked about parts of the theory, as there are with any theory, but there's no real scientific controversy about it. ... When I joined I didn't think they were about bashing evolution. It's pseudo-science, at best. ... What they're doing is instigating a [[conflict thesis|conflict between science and religion]]."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002450329_danny24.html|title=Evolving opinion of one man|author=Westneat D|publisher=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=24 August 2005}}</ref>

== Counter-petitions ==

Responding in the form of a humorous parody, the [[National Center for Science Education]] launched [[Project Steve]], a list of scientists named "Steve", or its equivalent (such as "Stephanie" or "Esteban"), who had signed a pro-evolution statement.<ref name=FAQs>{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/taking-action/project-steve-faq |title=Project Steve FAQ|publisher=NCSE |format= |work= |accessdate=02 July 2012}}</ref> {{As of|2012|07|02}}, the Steve-o-meter registered 1,221 Steves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/taking-action/list-steves |title=The List of Steves|publisher=NCSE |format= |work= |accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref> A Discovery Institute spokesperson responded that "if Project Steve was meant to show that a considerable majority of the scientific community accepts a naturalistic conception of evolution, then the National Center for Science Education (NCSE) could have saved its energies &ndash; that fact was never in question. The more interesting question was whether any serious scientists reject a naturalistic conception of evolution".<ref>{{cite web |author=Dembski WA|date=19 March 2003|url=http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=1393 |title=CSC - Project Steve - Establishing the Obvious: |publisher=Discovery Institute |work= |accessdate=25 April 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110521110208/http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=1393| archivedate= 21 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

After the Discovery Institute presented the petition as part of an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief in the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Kitzmiller v. Dover]] [[intelligent design]] court case in October 2005, a counter-petition, ''[[A Scientific Support For Darwinism]]'', was organized and gathered 7,733 signatures from scientists in four days.<ref>{{cite book |author=Decker, Mark Lowry; Moore, Randy |title=More than Darwin: an encyclopedia of the people and places of the evolution-creationism controversy |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-313-34155-9 |oclc= |doi= }}</ref>
