[[Jenderal Besar|General of the Army]] [[Priyayi#Titles|Raden]] '''Soedirman''' ([[EYD|Perfected Spelling]]: '''Sudirman'''; 24&nbsp;January 1916&nbsp;<U+2013> 29&nbsp;January 1950) was an Indonesian general during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]]. The first commander-in-chief of the [[Indonesian Armed Forces]], he continues to be highly respected in Indonesia.

Sudirman was born in [[Purbalingga]], [[Dutch East Indies]], to a [[wong cilik|commoner]] and his wife, then adopted by his uncle, a [[priyayi|noble]]. After the family moved to [[Cilacap]] in 1916, Sudirman was raised to be a diligent student; he was also highly active in extra-curricular activities, including a scouting program run by the Islamic organisation [[Muhammadiyah]]. While still in middle school, Sudirman showed leadership and organisational skills and became respected within the community for his devotion to Islam. After dropping out of teacher's college, in 1936 he began working as a teacher, and later headmaster, at a Muhammadiyah-run elementary school; he was also active with several other Muhammadiyah programs, becoming the leader of the Muhmmadiyah Youth Group in 1937. After the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupied the Indies]] in 1942, Sudirman continued to teach. In 1944, he joined the Japanese-sponsored [[Pembela Tanah Air|Defenders of the Homeland]] as a battalion commander in [[Banyumas]]. In this position he put down a rebellion by his fellow soldiers, but was later interned in [[Bogor]]. After [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesia proclaimed its independence]] on 17&nbsp;August 1945, Sudirman led a break-out from the detention center, then went to Jakarta to meet President [[Sukarno]]. He was tasked with overseeing the surrender of Japanese soldiers in Banyumas, which he did after establishing a local division of the People's Safety Body. Armed with the confiscated Japanese weapons, Sudirman's command was made part of the Fifth Division on 20&nbsp;October by interim commander-in-chief [[Oerip Soemohardjo]]; Sudirman was put in charge of the division.

On 12&nbsp;November 1945, at a vote to decide the military's commander-in-chief in [[Yogyakarta]], Sudirman was chosen over Oerip in a close vote; Oerip, who had been in the military since before Sudirman was born, was made chief of staff. While waiting to be confirmed, Sudirman ordered an assault on British and Dutch forces stationed in [[Ambarawa]]. The ensuing battle and British withdrawal led to Sudirman gathering more popular support, before he was ultimately confirmed on 18&nbsp;December. During the following three years Sudirman saw negotiations with the returning Dutch colonial forces fail, first after the [[Linggadjati Agreement]]&nbsp;<U+2013> in which Sudirman participated in drafting&nbsp;<U+2013> and then the [[Renville Agreement]]&nbsp;<U+2013> which led to Indonesia granting land taken during [[Operation Product]] to the Dutch forces and the withdrawal of 35,000 Indonesian troops. He was also faced with internal dissent, including a [[Madiun Affair|1948 ''coup d'<U+00E9>tat'' attempt]]. He later blamed these issues for his [[tuberculosis]]; the infection led to his right lung being collapsed in November&nbsp;1948.

On 19&nbsp;December 1948, several days after Sudirman's release from the hospital, the Dutch launched [[Operation Kraai]], an attempt to capture Yogyakarta. While the political leadership took shelter at the [[Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat|sultan's palace]], Sudirman, a small group of soldiers, and his personal doctor went south and began a seven-month [[guerrilla]] campaign. Initially followed by Dutch forces, Sudirman escaped and made his headquarters at Sobo, near [[Mount Lawu]], where he was able to command military activities in Java; this included a [[show of force]] in Yogyakarta on 1&nbsp;March 1949, led by Lieutenant Colonel [[Suharto]]. When the Dutch began withdrawing, in July 1949 Sudirman was called back to Yogyakarta. Although he wanted to continue fighting the Dutch troops, he was forbidden by Sukarno. Greatly weakened by his guerrilla journey, Sudirman had a relapse of tuberculosis; this led to him retiring to [[Magelang]]. He died slightly more than a month after the Dutch recognised Indonesia's independence. He is buried at [[Kusumanegara Heroes' Cemetery|Semaki Heroes' Cemetery]] in Yogyakarta.

Sudirman's death was grieved throughout Indonesia, with flags flow at [[half mast]] throughout the country and thousands gathering to see his funeral convoy and procession. He continues to be highly respected in Indonesia. His guerrilla period has been credited with originating the army's ''[[esprit de corps]]'', and the {{convert|100|km|adj=on}} long route he took must be followed by Indonesian [[cadet]]s before graduation. Sudirman featured prominently on the 1968 series of [[Indonesian rupiah|rupiah]] banknotes, and has numerous streets, museums, and monuments named after him. On 10&nbsp;December 1964 he was declared a [[National Hero of Indonesia]].

==Early life==
Sudirman was born to Karsid Kartawiraji (father) and Siyem while they lived with Siyem's sister Tarsem (originally Turidawati), one of three women married to the sub-district head [[Raden]] Cokrosunaryo, in Rembang, Bodas Karangjati, [[Purbalingga]], [[Dutch East Indies]].{{efn|Karsid and his wife had moved to Rembang in 1915, after Karsid left his job on a Dutch-owned [[sugarcane]] plantation in Purbalingga {{harv|Sardiman|2008|p=8}}; other sources suggest he was fired {{harv|Adi|2011|pp=1<U+2013>2}}. The journey was {{convert|145|km}} by land, which Siyem made while pregnant {{harv|Sardiman|2008|p=8}}.}}{{efn|Cokrosunaryo had no children {{harv|Imran|1980|p=2}}.}}{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=1<U+2013>2}}{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=1}} According to the family's records, Sudirman&nbsp;<U+2013> named by his uncle&nbsp;<U+2013> was born on a [[Javanese calendar#Wetonan cycle|''pon'' Sunday]] in the month of Maulud in the [[Javanese calendar]]; the Indonesian government later established 24&nbsp;January 1916 as Sudirman's birthday. As Cokrosunaryo was in a better financial situation, he adopted Sudirman and gave him the title Raden, reserved for [[Javanese people|Javanese]] nobility;{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=1<U+2013>2}} however, Sudirman was not told that Cokrosunaryo was not his birth father until he was eighteen.{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=3}} When Cokrosunaryo retired from his position chief in late 1916, Sudirman went with the family to Manggisan, [[Cilacap]], where he was raised.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=1<U+2013>2}} In Cilacap Karsid and Siyem had another son, Muhammad Samingan. Karsid died when Sudirman was six, at which time Siyem left the boys with her brother-in-law and went back to her village at Parakan Onje, Ajibarang.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=1<U+2013>2}}{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=4}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=7}}

Sudirman was raised with stories of heroic deeds and taught the etiquette and ways of the ''[[priyayi]]'', or noble cast,{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=3}} as well as the work ethic and simplicity of the ''[[wong cilik]]'', or commoners.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=12}} For his religious education, he studied Islam under [[Kyai]] [[Hajji]] Qahar with his brother; Sudirman was a religious child, and was known to always [[salah|pray]] on time. He was soon entrusted with performing the both the ''[[adhan]]'' and ''[[iqama]]'', or calls to prayer.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|pp=14<U+2013>15}} When he was seven years old, Sudirman was enroled at a ''Hollandsch Inlandsche School'', where he was an average student.{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=3}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|pp=16<U+2013>17}} The family, although it had enough to live by, was not rich. During his tenure as sub-district head, Cokrosunaryo had not accumulated much wealth, and in Cilacap he became a distributor of [[Singer Corporation|Singer]] sewing machines.{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=4}}

In his fifth year of school, Sudirman asked to leave his schooling, concerned with the ridicule he faced at the government-run school;{{efn|{{harvtxt|Adi|2011|p=3}} writes that Sudirman was teased for his background, as most of his classmates would have been from old noble families or ones which had strong ties to the Dutch.}} this request was at first refused, but Sudirman was transferred to a junior high school run by [[Taman Siswa]] in his seventh year of school.{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=3}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|pp=16<U+2013>17}}{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=10}} In his eighth year, Sudirman transferred to Wirotomo Junior High School{{efn|Wirotomo literally translates as "main gate" {{harv|Sardiman|2008|p=19}}.}} after the Taman Siswa School was found to be unregistered and closed under the Wild School Ordinance ({{lang|nl|Wilde Scholen Ordonantie}}).{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=10}}{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=4}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=18}} Many of Sudirman's teachers at Wirotomo were [[Indonesian National Awakening|Indonesian nationalists]], which influenced his views of the Dutch colonists.{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=4}} Sudirman studied diligently at school; his teacher Suwarjo Tirtosupono later recalled that Sudirman would already be studying second-term lessons while the class was still in term one. Although he performed poorly in [[Javanese alphabet|Javanese calligraphy]], Sudirman was strong in mathematics, science, and writing in both Dutch and Indonesian.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|pp=20<U+2013>21}} Sudirman also became more religious under the guidance of his teacher Raden Mohamad Kholil; his classmates named him "[[hajji]]" because of his devotion to his prayers, and Sudirman took up preaching to other students.{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=6}} Aside from his studies and religious activities, Sudirman also served in the school's musical troupe and on the [[association football|football]] team, on which he was a [[Defender (association football)|defender]].{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=5}} Although Cokrosunaryo's death in 1934 left the family poor, Sudirman was allowed to continue his studies without paying until he graduated later that year;{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=6}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=73}} after his step-father's death, Sudirman also devoted more time to studying the [[Sunnah]] and prayer.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=28}} By age 19, Sudirman had become a [[pupil teacher]] at Wirotomo.{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=4}}

While at Wirotomo Sudirman was a member of the Wirotomo Student Union, drama club, and band.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=22}} He helped establish a branch of the Hizboel Wathan (literally "defenders of the homeland"), an organisation similar to the [[Boy Scouts]], which was run by the Islamic establishment [[Muhammadiyah]]. Sudirman became the leader of the Cilacap division after graduating from Wirotomo.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=7<U+2013>9}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=39}} as a leader, he was tasked with deciding and planning his groups' activities. He emphasised the need for religious studies, making the contingents from Cilacap attend Muhammadiyah conferences throughout Java.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=46}} He taught the younger members{{efn|Hizboel Wathan was open to children as young as seven {{harv|Sardiman|2008|p=37}}.}} about the history of Islam and the importance of morality, while with older members he enforced near-military discipline.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|pp=48<U+2013>49}}

==Teaching==
After graduating from Wirotomo, Sudirman spent a year at a Muhammadiyah-run [[Normal school|teacher's college]] in [[Surakarta]], but later dropped out for a lack of funds.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=74}} In 1936 he returned to Cilacap as a teacher at a Muhammadiyah-run elementary school after learning teaching techniques from his teachers at Wirotomo; that year he married Alfiah, the daughter of the rich [[batik]] merchant Raden Sastroatmojo, whom he had known since his time at Wirotomo.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=10<U+2013>13}}{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=15}} After the marriage Sudirman lived at his father-in-law's house in Cilacap so he could save money for his own home.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=10<U+2013>13}} The couple went on to have seven children: Ahmad Tidarwono, Didi Praptiastuti, Didi Sutjiati, Taufik Effendi, Didi Pudjiati, Muhammad Teguh Bambang Tjahjadi, and Titi Wahjuti Satyaningrum.{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=15}}

As a teacher, Sudirman taught his students lessons on morality using examples from lives of the [[Prophets in Islam|prophets]] and traditional ''[[wayang]]'' stories.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=10<U+2013>13}} One of his students later recalled that Sudirman was an even-handed and patient teacher who would mix humour and nationalism in his lessons; this made him popular with the students.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=76}} A hard-working teacher despite poor pay, although he had no teacher's certificate within several years Sudirman had become headmaster;.{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=14}} as headmaster, his monthly wages quadrupled from three [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]] to twelve and a half. As headmaster, Sudirman worked on numerous administrative duties, including finding middle ground between disagreeing teachers. A coworker later recalled that Sudirman was a moderate, democratic leader for the school.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|pp=80<U+2013>83}} He was also active in fundraising, both for the needs of his school and the construction of others.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=84}}

During this time Sudirman also continued to serve with Muhammadiyah, as a member of the Muhammadiyah Youth Group. With the group he was known as a keen negotiator and mediator, working to resolve issues between members; he also [[dawah|preached]] at the local mosque.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|pp=53<U+2013>54}} He was elected as Chair of the Banyumas District of the Muhammadiyah Youth Group at the end of 1937. In this role he enacted policies facilitating members' studies and activities, both religious and not. He was later put in charge of Youth Group activities throughout [[Central Java]]{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=10<U+2013>13}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=56}} and spent much of his free time travelling and preaching Islam, putting an emphasis on self-awareness.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|pp=87<U+2013>88}} Alfiah was also active in Muhammadiyah-sponsored activities through the group's women branch, Nasyiatul Aisyiyah.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=66}}

==Japanese occupation==
[[File:Capture of Governor-General Stachouwer .JPG|thumb|Governor-General [[Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer]] and General [[Hein ter Poorten]], brought into an internment camp; the two capitulated to invading Japanese forces on 9&nbsp;March 1942, leading to a [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|three-year long occupation]].]]
When World War&nbsp;II broke out in Europe, the Dutch colonials&nbsp;<U+2013> who had previously limited military training for [[native Indonesians]]&nbsp;<U+2013> began teaching the populace how to deal with an [[strategic bombing|air raid]]; it was expected that the Japanese, who had already made aggressive moves against mainland China, would try to invade the Indies. To ease the preparations, the Dutch formed Air Raid Preparation teams ({{lang|nl|Luch Bischermen Diens}}). Sudirman, respected in the community, was asked to lead the Cilacap chapter. Aside from teaching local citizens the proper safety procedures for dealing with an air raid, Sudirman began establishing watchposts throughout the area. He and the Dutch would also have passing aircraft drop materials to simulate a bombing run; this was intended to improve response time.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=98}}

After the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese began occupying the Indies]] in early 1942, winning several battles against <!--understaffed--> Dutch and Dutch-trained forces of the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] ({{lang|nl|Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger}}, or KNIL), on 9&nbsp;March 1942 Governor-General [[Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer]] and head of the KNIL General [[Hein ter Poorten]] capitulated. This brought numerous changes in the governance of the archipelago and reduced the quality of life for non-Japanese in the Indies.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=18<U+2013>24}} In Cilacap, Sudirman's school had been closed and turned into a military outpost;{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=26<U+2013>27}} this was part of a widespread effort to close private schools.{{efn|Sources differ on who closed the school, either the Dutch {{harv|Sardiman|2008|p=108}} or the Japanese {{sfn|Imran|1980|p=17}}.}}{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=17}} After Sudirman convinced the Japanese to reopen the school, he and the other teachers were forced to use substandard supplies, such as charcoal as a writing utensil, in their studies. Sudirman was also involved in several social and humanitarian organisations during this period, including as chair of the Indonesian People's Cooperation ({{lang|id|Koperasi Bangsa Indonesia}}).{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=26<U+2013>27}} This brought him greater recognition among the people of Cilacap.{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=20}}

In early 1944, after a year as a representative at the Japanese-run regency council board (''Syu Sangikai''),{{sfn|Imran|1980|pp=21<U+2013>22}} Sudirman was asked to join the [[Pembela Tanah Air|Defenders of the Homeland]] ({{lang|id|Pembela Tanah Air}}, or PETA); the Japanese occupation government had established PETA in October 1943 to help repel any [[Allies (World War II)|Allied]] invasion,{{sfn|Imran|1980|pp=21<U+2013>22}}{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=28<U+2013>30}} and were focused on recruiting younger men, those who had "not yet been 'contaminated{{'"}} by Dutch rule.{{sfn|Said|1991|p=6}} After a few days of hesitance, he agreed to begin training in [[Bogor]]. Owing to his standing in the community, Sudirman was made a commander (''daidanco'') and trained with other persons of that rank. Trained by Japanese officers and soldiers, the cadets were armed with confiscated Dutch equipment. After four months of training Sudirman was put in charge of the battalion stationed at Kroya, [[Banyumas]], [[Central Java]], not far from Cilacap.{{efn|The rank of an officer was based on his standing in society. The lowest-level officers, platoon leaders known as ''Shodanco'', were recent graduates. Company commanders, known as ''Cudanco'', were established members of society. The battalion commanders were drawn from respected members of society {{harv|Sardiman|2008|p=109}}.}}{{sfn|Imran|1980|pp=21<U+2013>22}}{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=28<U+2013>30}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|pp=109<U+2013>112}}

Sudirman's time as a PETA commander passed uneventfully until 21 April 1945, when PETA troops under the command of Kusaeri began to rebel against the Japanese. Ordered to stop the rebellion, Sudirman agreed to do so only if the PETA rebels would not be harmed, and places harbouring them not razed; this condition was accepted by the Japanese commander, and Sudirman and his troops began searching for the rebels. Although Kusaeri's men initially shot at the commander, after Sudirman used a loudspeaker to tell them they would not be harmed, they backed down.{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=31}} Kusaeri surrendered on 25&nbsp;April.{{efn|For his role in the rebellion Kusaeri was sentenced to death by the Japanese military court. However, owing to pressures against the Japanese home islands by Allied forces he was not executed {{harv|Adi|2011|p=32}}.}} This garnered support for Sudirman within the occupation forces, although several high-ranking Japanese officers expressed concern over Sudirman's support for Indonesian independence. Sudirman and his men were soon sent to a camp in [[Bogor]], ostensibly for training; however, they were tasked with hard labour as a way to prevent a further uprising, and rumours circulated that the PETA officers would be killed.{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=32}}

==National revolution==

===Commander in Chief===
[[File:Indonesian Military Headquarters, Gondokusuman, Yogyakarta.JPG|thumb|left|The first dedicated TKR headquarters, located in Gondokusuman, Yogyakarta]]
After the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in early August 1945, followed by the [[proclamation of Indonesian independence]] on 17 August,{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=32}} Sudirman led a break out from the camp in Bogor. Although his fellow internees wanted to attack the Japanese soldiers, Sudirman convinced them against it; after ordering his fellow internees to return to their hometowns, Sudirman made his way to [[Jakarta]] and met with President [[Sukarno]], who asked him to lead resistance against Japanese forces in the city. Unfamiliar with Jakarta, Sudirman refused, instead offering to lead forces in Kroya. He left for his former command on 19&nbsp;August 1945.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=33<U+2013>34}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|pp=121<U+2013>122}} At the same time, allied forces were in the process of retaking the Indonesian archipelago for the Netherlands.{{efn|Australian forces, for example, had fought extensive campaigns in [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] and [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Borneo]] through 1945 {{harv|Coates|2006|pp=278<U+2013>280, 282}}, and the British retook Singapore in September 1945 {{harv|Bayly|Harper|2007|p=194}}.}} The first British forces arrived on 8&nbsp;September 1945.{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=36}}

In late August,{{efn|{{harvtxt|Said|1991|p=23}} gives the date as 22&nbsp;August, while {{harvtxt|Anderson|2005|pp=103<U+2013>106}} gives the date as 23&nbsp;August.}}, Sukarno established the People's Safety Body ({{lang|id|''Badan Keamanan Rakjat''}}, or BKR), which united troops from the former PETA, Heih<U+014D>, and KNIL. The BKR served mostly as a police organisation,{{sfn|Anderson|2005|pp=103<U+2013>106}} partly because the political leadership were intent on using diplomacy to garner international recognition of the new country and partly to avoid appearing overly aggressive to the Japanese forces still in the archipelago.{{sfn|Said|1991|p=11}} Sudirman and several of his fellow PETA soldiers formed a BKR branch in Banyumas in late August, after stopping at Kroya and discovering that his battalion had been disbanded. In a meeting with the Japanese commander for the region Saburo Tamura and the [[Resident (title)|resident]] of Banyumas, Iwashige, Sudirman and Iskak Cokroadisuryo forced the Japanese to surrender and hand over their weapons while a crowd of armed Indonesians encircled the Japanese camp. Many of these weapons were later used by Sudirman's BKR unit, making them one of the best equipped in the country; surplus weapons were distributed to other battalions.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=42<U+2013>43}}{{sfn|KR 1950, Djenderal Sudirman Wafat}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=123}}{{sfn|Said|1991|p=13}}

As the newly independent nation did not yet have a professional military, on 5&nbsp;October 1945 Sukarno passed a decree establishing the [[Indonesian Army|People's Security Army]] ({{lang|id|''Tentara Keamaanan Rakjat''}} or TKR, now known as the {{lang|id|''Tentara Nasional Indonesia''}}). Most officers were former KNIL officers, while rank-and-file soldiers were mostly PETA and Heih<U+014D>.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|pp=232<U+2013>234}} As the decreed Commander of Chief of the Armed Forces, [[Soeprijadi]], failed to show,{{efn|Soeprijadi, a PETA soldier who had led an uprising against Japanese forces in [[Blitar]] in February&nbsp;1945, was thought dead.

Meanwhile, {{harvtxt|Said|1991|p=28}} suggests that Soeprijadi's selection was an indication of Sukarno's hesitancy to establish an army.}} chief of staff Lieutenant General [[Oerip Soemohardjo]] served as an interim leader.{{sfn|Imran|1983|pp=71<U+2013>72}} That October British-led forces, tasked with disarming Japanese troops and repatriating Dutch [[prisoners of war]], arrived in [[Semarang]], then made their way south to [[Magelang]]. When the British began rearming repatriated Dutch prisoners and seemed to be preparing a military base in Magelang, Sudirman&nbsp;<U+2013> now a colonel&nbsp;<U+2013> sent some of his troops under Lieutenant Colonel Isdiman to drive them away; the mission was successful, and the European soldiers withdrew to [[Ambarawa]], midway between Magelang and Semarang.{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=28}} On 20 October Sudirman was put in command of the Fifth Division,{{efn|The Fifth Division covered the [[Kedu Residency|Kedu]] and Banyumas areas.

On 12&nbsp;November 1945, at the first general meeting of Army leadership, Sudirman was elected leader of the Army following two deadlocked votes. In the third round, Oerip had 21 votes to Sudirman's 22; division commanders from [[Sumatra]], who had voted unanimously for Sudirman, swayed the vote in Sudirman's favour.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Said|1991|p=3}} writes that the lack of political guidance while Oerip was commander in chief had led to the military choosing its own leader, rather than have one appointed.}}{{sfn|Nasution|2011|p=196}}{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=30}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=132}} Sudirman, aged 29 at the time, was surprised at his selection and offered to surrender the leadership position to Oerip, but the meeting did not allow it. Oerip himself was glad to no longer be in charge of the entire Army. Sudirman kept Oerip to serve as chief of staff under him. In accordance with his new role, Sudirman was promoted to general.{{sfn|Imran|1983|pp=74<U+2013>79}}{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=46}}

After the meeting, Sudirman returned to Banyumas to await confirmation and began theorising strategies on how repel Allied advances.{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=46}}{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=32}} The Indonesians feared that the Dutch, through the Netherlands-Indies Civil Administration ({{lang|nl|Nederlandsch Indi<U+00EB> Civil Administratie}}), would attempt to retake the archipelago; soldiers of the Dutch-British alliance had landed in Java in September, and a [[battle of Surabaya|large battle]] had occurred in Surabaya in late October-early November.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1993|p=217}} This instability, as well as Sukarno's uncertainty about Sudirman's qualifications,{{efn|Sudirman at the time had but two years military experience {{harv|Adi|2011|p=50}} The other leading candidate, Oerip, had been a military officer since before Sudirman was born {{harv|Imran|1983|p=27}}.}} led to a delay in Sudirman's confirmation.{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=50}}

While waiting to be confirmed, in late November Sudirman ordered the Fifth Division to attack allied forces stationed in Ambarawa, once again with Lieutenant Colonel Isdiman in charge. This assault was responded with an air strike and tank movements, leading the Division to retreat; Isdiman died in the battle.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=136}} Sudirman then led the Division in another assault against allied forces; the Indonesian troops were armed with a variety of weapons, ranging from bamboo spears and confiscated [[katana]]s to rifles, while the British were armed with modern equipment. Sudirman led from the front, wielding a katana.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|pp=214<U+2013>215}} The allies, whose air support had been cut-off when guerrilla soldiers attacked Kalibanteng Airfield in Semarang, were put on the defensive and holed up in Willem Fortress. On 12&nbsp;December Sudirman led a four-day siege, which resulted in the allied forces withdrawing to Semarang.{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=32}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=137}}

The Battle of Ambarawa brought Sudirman greater attention at a national scale,{{sfn|KR 1950, Djenderal Sudirman Wafat}} and silenced whispers that Sudirman was unfit for military command because of his lack of experience and previous employment as a schoolteacher.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=216}} Ultimately, Sudirman was chosen as his loyalty was undoubted, while Oerip's former pledge of loyalty to the Dutch led to him being viewed with suspicion. Sudirman was confirmed as Commander in Chief on 18&nbsp;December 1945.{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=50}} He was replaced as head of the Fifth Division by Colonel Sutiro,{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|pp=126<U+2013>127}} and began to focus on strategic problems.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=142}}

[[File:Sudirman saluting 27 May 1946 KR.JPG|thumb|upright|Sudirman, upon his confirmation on 18&nbsp;December 1945]]
Together, Sudirman and Oerip were able to eliminate much of the differences and mistrust between former KNIL and PETA troops. The government renamed the Army twice in January 1946, first to the Peoples' Salvation Army ({{lang|id|''Tentara Keselamatan Rakjat''}}), then to the Army of the Republic of Indonesia ({{lang|id|''Tentara Repoeblik Indonesia''}}, or TRI).{{sfn|Anderson|2005|pp=372<U+2013>373}}{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=51}} This was followed by the formal establishment of a [[Indonesian Navy|navy]] and [[Indonesian Air Force|air force]] in early 1946.{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=51}} In the meantime, the Indonesian government had moved from Jakarta&nbsp;<U+2013> now under Dutch control&nbsp;<U+2013> to Yogyakarta in January; delegates led by Prime Minister [[Sutan Sjahrir]] spent much of April and May unsuccessfully negotiating for Dutch recognition of Indonesian sovereignty.{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=53}} On 25 May Sudirman was reconfirmed as commander in chief of the expanded military,{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=51}} after a reorganisation of the military.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|pp=372<U+2013>373}}{{sfn|Imran|1983|pp=80<U+2013>81}} At the ceremony, Sudirman swore to protect the republic "until he shed his last drop of blood."{{efn|Original: "''... sampai titi' darah jang penghabisan.''"}}{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=35}}

The leftist Minister of Defence [[Amir Sjarifuddin]], who had received greater power in the reorganisation, began collecting socialist and communist troops under his direct control, as well as leftist paramilitary units (''{{lang|id|laskar}}''). The minister instituted [[political education]] programmes in the army, which were meant to spread leftist ideology. This use of the military for political manoeverings disappointed both Sudirman and Oerip, who were at the time busy ensuring equal treatment for soldiers from different military backgrounds.{{sfn|Imran|1983|pp=82<U+2013>84}}{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=56<U+2013>57}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=145}} However, rumours among the populace had spread that Sudirman was preparing for a ''[[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]''. In July 1946 Sudirman addressed these rumours through a speech broadcast on [[Radio Republik Indonesia]] (RRI), stating that he, like all Indonesians, was a servant of the State,{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=58}} and that, if he were offered the presidency, he would refuse it.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=146}} In his later career he would express that the military had no place in politics, and vice versa.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=218}}

===Negotiations with the Dutch===
[[File:Sudirman in Jakarta (1946).jpg|thumb|left|Sudirman arriving in Jakarta on 1 November 1946]]
Meanwhile, Sjahrir continued to work on negotiations with the Allied forces. On 7&nbsp;October 1946, Sjahrir and the former Dutch Prime Minister, [[Wim Schermerhorn]], agreed to work towards a ceasefire. The discussions were to be moderated by the British diplomat [[Miles Lampson, 1st Baron Killearn|Lord Killearn]] and involve Sudirman. Sudirman took a specially commissioned train to Jakarta, departing on 20&nbsp;October. However, he ordered it to return to Yogyakarta when Dutch troops refused to allow him and his men to enter the city with their weapons, feeling that such an order violated his sense of honour; the Dutch apologised, construing the events as a misunderstanding. Sudirman took another train in late October, arriving at [[Gambir Station]] in Jakarta on 1&nbsp;November, where he was greeted by large crowds.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=60<U+2013>61}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=151}} The discussions in Jakarta resulted in the drafting of the [[Linggadjati Agreement]] on 15 November; the agreement was ratified on 25 March 1947, despite heavy opposition from Indonesian nationalists.{{sfn|Britannica, Linggadjati Agreement}}{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=66}} Sudirman was vocally against the agreement, which he found to be detrimental to Indonesian interests,{{sfn|Imran|1980|pp=38<U+2013>40}} but considered it his obligation to obey his orders.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=155}}

In early 1947, with the Linggadjati Agreement granting relative peace, Sudirman began work on consolidating the TKR with various ''laskar'', funded and loyal to the various political parties.{{efn|The [[Socialist Party of Indonesia]], for example, had Pesindo, while the [[Masyumi Party]] had Hisbollah {{harv|Said|1991|p=24}}.}}  As part of a committee, Sudirman began reorganising the military; they reached an agreement in May 1947, and on 3&nbsp;June 1947 the Indonesian National Armed Forces ({{lang|id|Tentara Nasional Indonesia}}, or TNI) was formalised; it consisted of TKR forces and various ''laskar'' groups.{{sfn|Imran|1980|pp=38<U+2013>40}} However, the ceasefire obtained through the Linggadjati Agreement was not long lasting. On 21&nbsp;July 1947 the Dutch forces&nbsp;<U+2013> which had occupied areas left by the British during their withdrawal&nbsp;<U+2013> launched [[Operation Product]], which quickly gained control of large swaths of Java and Sumatra; the national government in Yogyakarta remained untouched.{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=71}} Sudirman called the army to fight, using the code "Ibu Pertiwi is calling! Ibu Pertiwi is calling!".{{efn|Original: "''Iboe Pertiwi memanggil! Iboe Pertiwi memanggil!" [[Ibu Pertiwi]] is a personification of the country.}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=157}} He later delivered several speeches over RRI in an unsuccessful attempt to encourage soldiers to fight against the Dutch.{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=73}}

[[File:Van Mook.png|thumb|The [[Van Mook Line]], with areas under Indonesian control in red;{{sfn|Kahin|1952|p=223}} in 1947 Sudirman was forced to recall over 35,000 troops from Dutch-held areas.]]
Pressured by the [[United Nations]], which had looked at the situation in the former East Indies with disdain, on 29&nbsp;August 1947 the Dutch established the [[Van Mook Line]], which divided Dutch- and Indonesian-controlled areas. Along this line a ceasefire was called.{{sfn|Kahin|1952|pp=218<U+2013>221}} Sudirman recalled the Indonesian guerrillas hiding in Dutch-held lands, ordering them to return to Indonesian-held areas. To keep their spirits up, he referred to the withdrawal as a ''hijrah'', reminiscent of [[Muhammad]]'s [[Hijra (Islam)|migration]] to [[Medina]] in 622&nbsp;AD, implying that they would return.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=77<U+2013>78}} Over 35,000 troops left western Java at this order, travelling to Yogyakarta by train and ship.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=79<U+2013>80}} This boundary was formalised by the [[Renville Agreement]] on 17&nbsp;January 1948; among the signatories was Amir Sjarifuddin, by then also serving as prime minister.{{sfn|Kahin|1952|pp=218<U+2013>221}} Meanwhile, Sjarifuddin began efforts to cut back on the number of troops, citing economic reasons. In this reshuffle, by presidential decree, on 2 January&nbsp;1948 Sudirman was demoted to mobile-brigade commander, with the rank lieutenant general. He was reinstated not long afterwards after he and Oerip complained to Sukarno that the decree would irrevocably weaken the military, but remained a lieutenant general. Sjarifuddin was ousted in a [[vote of no confidence]] for his involvement in the Renville Agreement, and the new prime minister, [[Mohammad Hatta]], worked with Sudirman to reduce leftist influences in the military.{{sfn|Jakarta City Government, Sudirman}}{{sfn|Imran|1980|pp=42<U+2013>45}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=160}}

Viewing the government as increasingly weak, Sjarifuddin gathered soldiers from the [[Socialist Party of Indonesia|Socialist Party]], [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Communist Party]], and members of the [[Sentral Organisasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia|All Indonesia Centre of Labour Organizations]] ({{lang|id|Sentral Organisasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia}}) for a would-be [[proletarian revolution]] in [[Madiun]], [[East Java]], which occurred on 18&nbsp;September 1948. Sudirman, ill at the time, sent his deputy Colonel [[Abdul Haris Nasution]] to deal with the revolution; Nasution and his soldiers had quashed the uprising by 30&nbsp;September.{{efn|This led to a purge against leftists over several months. Sjarifuddin was among those executed for their involvement in the rebellion {{harv|Adi|2011|pp=82<U+2013>84}}.}}{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=82<U+2013>84}}

[[File:Panti Rapih Hospital 16 June 2012.JPG|thumb|left|[[Panti Rapih Hospital]], where Sudirman was treated for [[tuberculosis]]]]
This rebellion, and ongoing political instability, sapped Sudirman of much of his remaining strength. On 5&nbsp;October 1948, after celebrations of the military's third anniversary, Sudirman collapsed. After being examined by numerous doctors, he was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. At the end of the month he was brought to [[Panti Rapih Hospital]] and had his right lung collapsed, in hope that it would stop the spread. During his time at the hospital, he delegated most of his duties to Nasution. However, the two continued to discuss plans for the war against the Dutch, and Sudirman continued to receive status reports. They agreed that guerrilla warfare, which had been applied on raids into Dutch-held territory since May, would be best suitable for their needs; towards this goal, Sudirman issued a general order on 11 November. He was released on 28&nbsp;November 1948.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=85<U+2013>87}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=164}}

Although he continued to issued orders, Sudirman only returned to active duty on 17&nbsp;December; considering the increasing tension between the Dutch and Indonesian forces, he ordered the TNI soldiers to be at increased awareness;{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=88}} he also ordered large-scale military exercises as a bluff, an unsuccessful attempt to convince the Dutch that the TNI was too strong to attack.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=179}} Two days later, after a nighttime announcement that they were no longer bound by the Renville Agreement, on 19&nbsp;December the Dutch launched [[Operation Kraai]], an attempt to capture the capital at Yogyakarta. By 07:10 local time (UTC+7), the airfield at [[Maguwo]] had been taken by paratroopers under the command of Captain Eekhout. Sudirman, upon becoming aware of the attack, had an order read over RRI which stated that soldiers should fight as they had been trained&nbsp;<U+2013> as guerrillas.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=90<U+2013>91}}

He then went to the Presidential Palace in central Yogyakarta, where the government were discussing a Dutch-issued ultimatum, in which they were ordered to accept Dutch rule or else the Dutch would storm the city proper. Sudirman urged that the president and Vice-President Hatta leave the city and fight as guerrillas, a suggestion that was denied. Although his doctors forbid it, Sudirman received permission from Sukarno to join his men as guerrillas. The central government evacuated to the [[Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat]] at the urging of Sultan [[Hamengkubuwana&nbsp;IX]], but were captured and exiled.{{sfn|Adi|2011|p=92-95}}

===Guerrilla warfare===
Sudirman first went to his official home and gathered sensitive documents, which he burned to avoid them falling into Dutch hands.{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=57}} He and a convoy, consisting of Sudirman, a small group of soldiers, and his personal doctor, then made their way south, towards Kretek, Parangtritis, [[Bantul]]. There they were received by the district head at 18:00. After several days in Kretek, during which time Sudirman sent undercover troops into the Dutch-occupied city for reconnaissance and to ask his wife for jewellery to sell and fund the guerrilla movement, he and his group travelled east along the south coast to [[Wonogiri Regency|Wonogiri]];{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=97<U+2013>99}} before the Dutch attack it had already been decided that Sudirman would be able to better control the guerrillas from eastern Java, where there were still several bases.{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=58}} Meanwhile, Alfiah and the children were ordered to stay in the Kraton.{{sfn|Jakarta City Government, Sudirman}} Aware that he was being pursued by the Dutch, on 23&nbsp;December Sudirman ordered his troops to continue to [[Ponorogo]], where they stopped at the home of Mahfuz, a ''[[kyai]]'' and [[ulama|Islamic religious leader]]; Mahfuz gave the general a cane to help him walk, although Sudirman was, and continued to be, carried on a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]]. They then continued east.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=100<U+2013>101}}

[[File:Sudirman surrounded by guerrilas 17 August 1950 KR.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sudirman, surrounded by his guerrillas during their campaign]]
Outside of [[Trenggalek]], Sudirman and his group were stopped by TNI soldiers belonging to 102&nbsp;Battalion.{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=61}} These soldiers, who were told that Sudirman&nbsp;<U+2013> who was in civilian clothes and unrecognised by the troops holding them&nbsp;<U+2013> was a prisoner, refused to allow the group to pass;{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=102<U+2013>105}} they were suspicious as Sudirman's convoy carried maps and notes on Indonesian military movements, things which may have belonged to spies.{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=62}} When the group's commander, Major Zainal Fanani, came to check the situation, he realised that Sudirman was with them and apologised. Told that his men were right to guard their areas diligently, Fanani called a post in [[Kediri Regency|Kediri]] and ordered that a car be sent to pick up the general and his troops. After a time in Kediri, they continued further east; as they left the city on 24&nbsp;December, Dutch planes attacked Kediri.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=102<U+2013>105}}

The constant Dutch attacks led Sudirman to change his clothes and give his old outfit to one of his soldiers, Second Lieutenant Heru Kesser&nbsp;<U+2013> who bore a resemblance to Sudirman.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=102<U+2013>105}}{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=64}} Kesser was ordered to head south with a large company of soldiers, remove the clothes, and furtively return north, while Sudirman waited in Karangnongko. The diversion was successful, and on 27&nbsp;December Sudirman and his men made their way to Jambu Village. Arriving on 9&nbsp;January 1949, Sudirman met with several government ministers who had escaped the Dutch attack on Yogyakarta: Supeno, Susanto Tirtoprojo, and Susilowati. With the politicians, Sudirman made his way to Banyutuwo, ordering some of his soldiers to linger back and hold off Dutch ground troops. In Banyutuwo, they held for over a week. However, on 21&nbsp;January, when Dutch forces approached the village, Sudirman and his entourage were forced to leave, fighting their way out in heavy rain.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=102<U+2013>105}}

Sudirman and his troops continued to make their way through the jungles and forests, eventually arriving at Sobo, near [[Mount Lawu]], on 18&nbsp;February. During the journey, Sudirman would use a radio set to convey orders to TNI troops scattered through the area if he felt the area was secure. Feeling weaker because of the physical hardships he had faced, including travelling through the forests and a lack of food, and believing the area to be secure, Sudirman decided that Sobo would serve as his guerrilla headquarters.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=106<U+2013>107}}{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=65}} The local commander, Lieutenant Colonel Wiliater Hutagalung, served as his go-between with the other TNI leaders. Aware that international opinion, which was beginning to condemnatory of Dutch actions in Indonesia, could bring Indonesia greater recognition, Sudirman and Hutagalung discussed possible terms of action, before agreeing on a large-scale assault.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=108<U+2013>110}} Meanwhile, the Dutch began advertising that they had captured Sudirman, a claim meant to break the morale of guerrillas who were fighting against the Dutch.{{sfn|KR 1950, Djenderal Sudirman Wafat}}{{sfn|McGregor|2007|p=138}}

Sudirman ordered Hutagalung to begin planning a full-scale assault, in which TNI soldiers&nbsp;<U+2013> in uniform&nbsp;<U+2013> would attack the Dutch and show their strength in front of foreign reporters and United Nations investigative teams. Hutagalung, together with officers under his commander Colonel Bambang Sugeng and government officials under Governor [[Wongsonegoro]], spent several days discussing ways to ensure the attack could be successful.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=108<U+2013>110}} The discussion resulted in the General Offensive of 1&nbsp;March 1949, in which TNI soldiers throughout central Java attacked Dutch outposts. Troops under Lieutenant Colonel [[Suharto]] retook Yogyakarta for six hours before withdrawing, a successful [[show of force]] which caused the Dutch to lose face internationally; they had previously declared the TNI eradicated.{{sfn|Adi|2011|pp=108<U+2013>110}}{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=74}}

[[File:Sudirman consulting after guerrila war 11 July 1949 KR.jpg|thumb|Sudirman (left), consulting with Lieutenant Colonel [[Suharto]] in Sobo]]
Under increased pressure from the United Nations, on 7&nbsp;May 1949 the Dutch signed the Roem-Royen Agreement, guaranteeing their withdrawal from Yogyakarta; they withdrew in late June. The Indonesian leadership began returning to Yogyakarta from exile in early July. Sukarno ordered Sudirman to return to Yogyakarta as well, but Sudirman refused to let the Dutch withdraw without a fight; he considered the TNI to now be strong enough to defeat the dispirited Dutch.  Although he was promised medicine and support in Yogyakarta, Sudirman refused to return to the political leadership, whom he considered acquiescent to the Dutch. He only agreed to return after his subordinate and close friend, Colonel [[Gatot Soebroto]], told him that Sudirman was needed as a military expert through a letter. On 10&nbsp;July, Sudirman and his group returned to Yogyakarta, where they were greeted by thousands of civilians and warmly received by the political elite there.{{sfn|Imran|1980|pp=75<U+2013>80}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=199}}

==Post-war and death==
In August Sudirman approached Sukarno and asked him to continue the guerrilla war; Sudirman did not expect the Dutch to abide by the Roem-Royen Agreement, based on the failings of the previous agreements. Sukarno disagreed, which was a blow to Sudirman. When Sudirman threatened to resign his post, blaming the government's inconsistency for his tuberculosis and Oerip's death in November&nbsp;1948, Sukarno threatened to do so as well.{{sfn|Jakarta City Government, Sudirman}}{{sfn|McGregor|2007|p=129}}{{sfn|Jakarta City Government, Oerip Soemohardjo}} As he thought that such a resignation would have a destabilising effect, Sudirman stayed his hand. Continuing to suffer from tuberculosis, Sudirman was checked into Panti Rapih.{{sfn|Imran|1980|pp=82<U+2013>83}} He stayed in Panti Rapih until near the end of the year, being released by October; he was transferred to a sanatorium in nearby Pakem.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=203}} As a result of his illness, Sudirman made few public appearances.{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=84}}{{sfn|KR 1950, Pak Dirman Istirahat}}{{sfn|KR 1950, Perdjalanan Terachir}} Sudirman was transferred to a home in Magelang in December.{{sfn|KR 1950, Magelang Berkabung}} In the meantime, the Indonesian and Dutch governments held a [[Dutch<U+2013>Indonesian Round Table Conference|several-month long conference]] which resulted in Dutch recognition of Indonesian sovereignty on 27&nbsp;December 1949.{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=83}} Sudirman, despite his illness, was reconfirmed that day as commander in chief of the TNI, now serving the newly established [[Republic of the United States of Indonesia]]. On 28&nbsp;December, Jakarta once again became the nation's capital.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=203}}

[[File:Sudirman's funeral procession 31 January 1950 KR.jpg|thumb|left|Sudirman's casket being carried by soldiers]]
Sudirman died in Magelang at 18:30 on 29&nbsp;January 1950; this was reported in a special broadcast over RRI.{{sfn|Imran|1980|p=84}} Upon receiving news of his death, the Sudirman family home received numerous visitors, including the entirety of the 9th Brigade, which was stationed nearby.{{sfn|KR 1950, Magelang Berkabung}} The following morning Sudirman's body was brought to Yogyakarta. As the funeral convoy passed, led by four [[tank]]s and consisting of eighty motor vehicles,{{sfn|KR 1950, Perdjalanan Terachir}} thousands of mourners stood at the sides of the streets. The convoy was facilitated by members of the 9th Brigade.{{sfn|KR 1950, Magelang Berkabung}}

The [[viewing (funeral)|viewing]], held at the Great Mosque of Yogyakarta in the afternoon, was attended by numerous political and military elite, from both Indonesia and foreign countries; this included Prime Minister [[Abdul Halim (Indonesia)|Abdul Halim]], Minister of Defence Hamengkubuwana&nbsp;IX, Minister of Health [[Johannes Leimena]], Minister of Justice [[Abdoel Gaffar Pringgodigdo]], Minister of Information Arnold Mononutu, Chief of the Air Force Soerjadi Soerjadarma, Colonel Paku Alam&nbsp;VIII, and Lieutenant Colonel Suharto.{{sfn|KR 1950, Perdjalanan Terachir}} The viewing was closed with a [[Three-volley salute|24-gun salute]].{{sfn|KR 1950, Perdjalanan Terachir}} Sudirman's body was brought to [[Kusumanegara Heroes' Cemetery|Semaki Heroes' Cemetery]] on foot, with a crowd of mourners {{convert|2|km}} long trailing behind.{{sfn|KR 1950, Perdjalanan Terachir}} He was interred next to Oerip, after another gun salute.

An obituary in the Yogyakarta-based daily ''[[Kedaulatan Rakyat|Kedaulatan Rakjat]]'' wrote that Indonesia had lost a "brave and true hero".{{efn|Original: "''... seorang pahlawan jang djudjur dan berani''"}}{{sfn|KR 1950, Pak Dirman Istirahat}} Colonel [[Paku Alam&nbsp;VIII]], in charge of the Yogyakarta area, told the national news agency [[ANTARA|Antara]] that all Indonesians, especially the armed forces, had "lost a father figure who did uncountable deeds for his country".{{efn|Original: "''... seluruh rakjat Indonesia umumnja dan angkatan perang chususnja, kehilangan seorang bapak jg tidak ternilai djasa2nja kepada tanah air ...''"}}{{sfn|KR 1950, Djenderal Sudirman Wafat}} The Indonesian Muslim leader [[Hamka|Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah]], writing soon after Sudirman's death, described the general as a "symbol of the strength of spirit shown by Indonesian heroes,"{{efn|Original: "'' ... lambang dari kebangunan djiwa pahlawan Indonesia.''"}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=218}} while the Muslim politician [[Muhammad Isa Anshary]] described Sudirman as a "son of the revolution, as he was born in the revolution, and raised by the revolution."{{efn|Original: "''Putera revolusi, karena dia lahir dalam revolusi, dan dibesarkan oleh revolusi.}}{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=219}} In a radio speech, Hatta described Sudirman as impossible to control and hard-headed, but ultimately intent on doing what was right for the country; Hatta noted that, although Sudirman often did not like the government's position, he would generally obey his orders.{{sfn|KR 1950, Djenderal Sudirman Wafat}}

[[File:Grave of Sudirman.JPG|thumb|right|Sudirman's grave at [[Kusumanegara Heroes' Cemetery|Semaki Heroes' Cemetery]] in Yogyakarta; it has become a [[ziyarat|pilgrimage]] destination.]]
Modern opinions in Indonesia tend to be laudatory. Sardiman, a professor of history at [[Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta State University]], writes that Sudirman was as lively a speaker as Sukarno, who was known for his fiery speeches,{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=93}} and a devoted, incorruptible, leader.{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=174}} The Indonesian historian and former Minister of Education and Culture Nugroho Notosusanto described Sudirman as "his only idol", citing the general's guerrilla period as the origin of the army's ''[[esprit de corps]]''.{{sfn|McGregor|2007|p=128}} The general's guerrilla campaign is emphasised in biographies of him because, during that period, the army had a greater role than the exiled political leadership;{{sfn|McGregor|2007|p=128}} beginning in the 1970s, all military cadets had to retrace the {{convert|100|km|adj=on}} long route prior to graduation, a "pilgrimage" meant to instill a sense of struggle.{{sfn|McGregor|2007|p=130}} Sudirman's grave is also a [[ziyarat|pilgrimage]] destination, both for the military and general public.{{sfn|McGregor|2007|p=133}} According to Katharine McGregor of the [[University of Melbourne]], the Indonesian military has elevated Sudirman to a saint-like status.{{sfn|McGregor|2007|p=220}}

Sudirman received numerous [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Indonesia|awards]] from the national government posthumously, including the Bintang Mahaputera Adipurna,{{sfn|Indonesian State Secretariat, Bintang Mahaputera Adipurna}} Bintang Mahaputera Pratama,{{sfn|Indonesian State Secretariat, Bintang Mahaputera Pratama}} Bintang Republik Indonesia Adipurna,{{sfn|Indonesian State Secretariat, Bintang Republik Indonesia Adipurna}} and Bintang Republik Indonesia Adipradana.{{sfn|Indonesian State Secretariat, Bintang Republik Indonesia Adipradana}} On 10&nbsp;December 1964 Sudirman was declared a [[National Hero of Indonesia]] by Presidential Decree 314 of 1964. Oerip was declared a National Hero by the same decree.{{sfn|Indonesian State Secretariat, Daftar Nama Pahlawan}} He was promoted to [[Jenderal Besar|General of the Army]] in 1997.{{sfn|McGregor|2007|p=139}}

[[File:Sudirman 5 rupiah note 1968.JPG|thumb|left|Sudirman on a 5 [[rupiah]] banknote, issued in 1968]]
According to McGregor, the military increasingly used Sudirman's image as a symbol of leadership as it gained more political power.{{sfn|McGregor|2007|p=127}} An image of Sudirman was featured on every denomination of the 1968 series of [[Indonesian rupiah|rupiah]].{{efn|This included the 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 rupiah bills {{harv|Cuhaj|2012|pp=501<U+2013>502}}.}}{{sfn|Cuhaj|2012|pp=501<U+2013>502}} He featured as a major character in several war films, including ''Janur Kuning'' (''Yellow Coconut Leaf''; 1979) and ''Serangan Fajar'' (''Dawn Attack''; 1982).{{sfn|McGregor|2007|p=127}}

Numerous museums have been dedicated to Sudirman. His childhood home in [[Purbalingga]] is now the Sudirman Museum,{{sfn|Sardiman|2008|p=8}} while his official home in Yogyakarta is now the Sasmitaloka Museum to General Sudirman.{{sfn|McGregor|2007|p=127}} The house in Magelang where he died is also a Sudirman Museum, established on 18&nbsp;May 1967 and containing artefacts belonging to the general.{{sfn|Magelang City Government, Museum Sudirman}} Other museums, including the [[Monument Yogya Kembali|Return to Yogya Monument]] in Yogyakarta and the [[Satria Mandala Museum]] in Jakarta have rooms dedicated to him.{{sfn|McGregor|2007|p=127}} Numerous streets are named after him, including a major street in Jakarta;{{sfn|Jakarta City Government, Sudirman}} McGregor states that nearly every city in the country has a General Sudirman Street. Statues and monuments to him are spread throughout the archipelago, most of which were built after 1970.{{sfn|McGregor|2007|p=127}} [[Jenderal Soedirman University]] in Banyumas, established in 1963, is named after him.{{sfn|Jenderal Soedirman University, About UNSOED}}
