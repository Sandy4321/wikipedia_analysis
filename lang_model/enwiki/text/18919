{{mergeto|Mining industry of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|date=February 2011}}

This article describes extractive sector companies that are [[Incorporation|incorporated]] in [[Canada]] and are either currently or previously active in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].  It encompasses [[mining]] and [[petroleum]] companies, both those carrying out commercial, large-scale extraction operations, and junior exploration and development companies.

When compared against other nations, Canada's mining presence in the D.R. Congo is in a distinct class for a number of reasons, including:

# '''Predominant Canadian corporate presence.''' The business database [[Datamonitor|Datamonitor 360]] (formerly ''MarketLine Business Information Centre'') identifies twenty-five international mining companies to be active in the D.R. Congo, and records Canadian-domiciled mining companies as having the highest presence among them, nine in total (African Metals Corporation, Banro Corp., BRC DiamondCore Ltd., El Ni<U+00F1>o Ventures Inc., First Quantum Minerals Ltd., ICS Copper Systems Ltd., Lundin Mining Corp., as well as Anvil Mining Ltd., misidentified as Australian, and Katanga Mining Ltd, misidentified as British), compared to six for [[Australia]] (Austral Africa Resources Ltd., BHP Billiton Group, Green Machine Development Corporation, Lindian Resources Ltd., Mawson West Ltd., Tiger Resources Ltd.), three from [[South Africa]] (African Rainbow Minerals, AngloGold Ashanti, Chrometco Ltd.), two in the [[United Kingdom]] (Mwana Africa PLC, Randgold Resources Ltd.), two from the [[United States]] (Century Aluminum Co., Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.), and one each from [[China]] (CIC Mining Resources Ltd., with Japanese Eco Energy Group's African subsidiary, Eco Project Company Ltd.), [[Morocco]] (Managem SA), and [[Switzerland]] (Xstrata plc)<ref>Datamonitor Group .

# '''Canadian dominance in Congolese industrial copper and cobalt production'''.  Garrett and Lintzer<ref name=garrett2010 /> reported unpublished growth projections made by the World Bank for Congolese copper and cobalt production during 2008 to 2014.  According to these data, Canadian companies First Quantum Minerals, Lundin Mining (in partnership with the US firm Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold) and Katanga Mining will have been responsible for more than two-thirds of total Congolese copper output from 2008 to 2013, and for more than two-thirds of total Congolese cobalt output from 2008 to 2014.  The only other actors cited were [[Belgium]] (George Forrest International S.A. - Kamoto Copper Company SARL) and China (unnamed)<ref name=garrett2010/>.  While more than eighty percent of Katanga Province's ore processing operations and [[Smelting|smelters]] were reported by the Governor, [[Mo<U+00EF>se Katumbi Chapwe|Moise Katumbi]], to be Chinese-owned in 2008, and ninety percent of the product exported to China<ref>Clark, Simon; Smith, Michael; Wild, Franz. 2008. "China in Africa: Young Workers, Deadly Mines", ''Bloomberg Markets'' 17(9) (September 2008): 80-98, http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=nw&pname=mm_0908_story3.html (accessed February 7, 2011).</ref>, the World Bank did not forecast Chinese production volumes to overtake that of individual Canadian-owned and Canadian-joint-owned copper operations until 2013, while Canadian-owned cobalt production is expected to exceed Chinese output until at least the year 2014<ref name=garrett2010 />.  In 2009, the tax revenue provided to the government of the D.R. Congo by one Canadian company, First Quantum Minerals, was estimated to represent between one-eighth and one-quarter of all Congolese tax revenues, making it the DRC's largest taxpayer that year, an amount equivalent to the DRC's entire health budget<ref name=garrett2010 />.  First Quantum quantified their overall contribution to the DRC economy as equivalent to 3.1% of the country's [[gross national income]] for 2009<ref name=fqmcsr2010 />. 
# '''Controversies and legislation.'''  An alleged violation of [[human rights]] involving the deaths of over seventy Congolese civilians was linked to a Canadian company, Anvil Mining, which has led to separate legal trials and investigations in the DRC, Australia and Canada<ref name=tougas2009 />.  Two Canadian companies, First Quantum Minerals<ref name=fqm2009 /> and Heritage Oil<ref name=heritage2010 />, have had their mining permits ''revoked'' by the DRC government since 2009, leading to ongoing international arbitration, legal proceedings, and alleged links to obstruction attempts by the [[Government of Canada]] in the negotiation of [[International Monetary Fund]] and World Bank [[debt relief]] to the DRC in 2010<ref name=bouw2010 />.  Since 2005, discussions of Canadian-Congolese mining have figured prominently in the Government of Canada's measures relating to corporate responsibility in overseas extractive sector operations, including the ''Subcommittee on Human Rights and Development of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade'' (SCFAIT) in 2005, the 2006 ''National Roundtables on Corporate Social Responsibility and the Canadian Extractive Sector in Developing Countries''<ref>Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada.

The D.R. Congo is a key destination for Canadian mining investments in Africa.  According to [[Natural Resources Canada]], Canadian mining assets in the D.R. Congo rose from Cdn.$321m. in 2001 to $864m. in 2006, and averaged $319m. over that period; these assets in 2006 represented 10.5% of total Canadian mining assets in Africa, and 1.3% of total Canadian mining assets outside of Canada, similar to the shares in 2001<ref name=natres2006>Sylvie Brassard. 2007.

== Social and environmental aspects ==

Two Canadian companies holding or previously holding mining concessions in the D.R. Congo placed among an annual listing by [[Corporate Knights]], a magazine related to corporate social responsibility, of fifty top Canadian corporate citizens in 2010: First Quantum placed 27th, and Kinross Gold Corporation 36th<ref>"Best 50 Corporate Citizens 2010", ''Corporate Knights Magazine'', Issue 32, 2010, http://www.corporateknights.ca/report/9th-annual-best-50-corporate-citizens-canada/best-50-corporate-citizens  (accessed January 20, 2011).</ref>.

In 2009, one Canadian mining company, [[First Quantum Minerals]], was estimated to be the D.R. Congo's largest individual source of tax revenue, US$57m. - roughly equal to the entire Congolese health budget - contributing between one-eighth and one-quarter of all forecast tax receipts from the mining sector<ref name=garrett2010>Garrett, Nicholas; Lintzer, Marie (2010). "Can Katanga's mining sector drive growth and development in the DRC?", ''Journal of Eastern African Studies'', 4(3), 400-424. doi:10.1080/17531055.2010.517408</ref>.  Reported Congolese government fiscal receipts from mining ranged between $11.7m. and $26.7m. during 2003-2006, although the World Bank considers these figures to be "poorly organized, incomplete, and of dubious reliability", and estimates that the D.R. Congo should generate $185m. per year from mining taxes during 2008-2012<ref>World Bank. 2008. "Democratic Republic of Congo.

A survey, commissioned by the [[Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada]], and covering 171 reported violations of corporate social responsibility by international mining companies operating in developing countries during 1999-2009, identified the D.R.

In 2010, researchers at the General Reference Hospital, a referral hospital in Panzi, South Kivu, reported that the highest rates of violent [[rape]] self-reported by women patients during 1999 to mid-2006 were coincident with locations where two Canadian mining companies are active; 33.2% of reported cases by rape survivors involving any of gang rape, [[Female genital cutting|genital mutilation]] or intentional [[sexually transmitted disease]] or [[HIV]] transmission, were from [[Walungu]], including the Twangiza-Namoya gold belt worked by Banro Corporation and where the [[:fr:Forces d<U+00E9>mocratiques de lib<U+00E9>ration du Rwanda|FDLR]] (Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda) and  [[:fr:Forces arm<U+00E9>es de la R<U+00E9>publique d<U+00E9>mocratique du Congo|FARDC]] (Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo) are reported to be active, and 31.2% of cases were in Kabare, near one of Shamika Resources' coltan concessions and where the FDLR and other militias are also reported to be active<ref>Mukwege, Denis Mukengere; Nangini, Cathy. 2009.

The UK-based NGO, [[RAID_(NGO)|RAID (Rights & Accountability in Development)]], carried out a survey in conjunction with a Congolese NGO, of 140 Chinese and Congolese workers in DRC mines in Katanga Province in 2008 and 2009, which included evaluations of their working conditions.  In response to the question "Which companies provide the best working conditions?", only 32 of 140 respondents selected Canadian companies, after the United States (94 "yes") and Europe (70 "yes"), but somewhat ahead of Australian (16), South African (15), Congolese (9) and Chinese firms (7); the researchers concluded that "[c]onditions in South African, Australian and Canadian companies were not rated highly, which should be a cause for concern for the respective governments"<ref>Rights & Accountability in Development.

== Political and legal aspects ==
=== Canadian legislation ===
In 2010, Canadian Member of Parliament [[Paul Dewar]] introduced a [[private member's bill]], [http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/redirector.aspx?RefererUrl=Publication.aspx%3fDocid=4668098%26file%3d4 Bill C-571], known as the "Trade in Conflict Minerals Act", which sought to ensure that Canadian companies do not purchase minerals from Burundi, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania that involved payments to illegal armed groups along the supply chain.  Related bills were, in 2009, [[John McKay (politician)#Private Members' Bill C-300|Private Members' Bill C-300]], ''An Act respecting Corporate Accountability for the Activities of Mining, Oil or Gas in Developing Countries''<ref name=billc300 />, and in 2010, Private Member's Bill C-354, ''An Act to amend the Federal Courts Act (international promotion and protection of human rights)'' <ref name=billc354 />.

=== Government of the D.R. Congo's review of mining agreements ===
DRC's Ministry of Mines undertook a review of fifty-seven mining contracts and six mining conventions during 2007.  Anvil Mining's and Katanga Mining's contracts were renegotiated successfully<ref name=miningjournalmarch2010>"The DRC.

=== Anvil Mining and Kilwa incident ===
In 2004, to quell a rebel uprising in the town of Kilwa, nearby Anvil Mining's Dikulushi minesite, the Congolese military requisitioned trucks and a plane from Anvil Mining, and Anvil provided additional logistical support; more than seventy persons were killed in this incident, according to a UN observer mission<ref name=tougas2009>Tougas, Denis.

A 2010 report released by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) determined that the "judicial decisions made during the Kilwa case are an illustration of the lack of impartiality and independence within the military justice system [...] No reference was made in the judgement to international law as it pertains to war crimes.

=== United Nations Security Council Panel of Experts ===
In 2002, a report on resource exploitation in the DRC by a [[United Nations Security Council]] panel of experts explicitly identified five Canadian companies to be "in violation of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises"; they were: First Quantum Minerals, Harambee Mining Corp., International Panorama Resources Corp., Melkior Resources, and Tenke Mining Corp <ref>United Nations Security Council. "Final report of the Panel of Experts on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other Forms of Wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo", S/2002/1146, 16 October 2002 http://www.undemocracy.com/S-2002-1146.pdf  (accessed January 20, 2011).</ref>.  The annex also included four other Canadian companies to which other countries of origin were attributed: American [sic] Mineral Fields and Kinross Gold Corporation (both USA), Banro Corporation (South Africa), and Lundin Group (Bermuda).  The five-member UN panel included one Canadian, Jim Freedman, an anthropologist and conflict resolution consultant<ref>Jim Freedman Consulting & Writing, Inc., http://jfconsult.ca/index.html (accessed January 20, 2011).</ref>.  Speaking at a meeting of the UN Security Council following this report's release, Canada's Ambassador to the United Nations, [[Paul Heinbecker]], welcomed the panel's overall conclusions, but noted that the alleged violations by individually-named companies were mainly unsubstantiated, and that, in Canada, these allegations diverted attention from the principal findings and recommendations<ref>United Nations. Security Council. 2002. "Report on exploitation of resources of Democratic Republic of Congo is challenged in. Security Council", Press Release, SC/7561, 4642nd Meeting (AM & PM), 05/11/2002, http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2002/SC7561.doc.htm (accessed March 26, 2011).</ref>.  Journalist Madeleine Drohan reported that some of the affected companies had contacted the office of Canada's minister of foreign affairs, Bill Graham, requesting their names to be removed<ref name=drohan2003/>. First Quantum was reported as saying that the bribery allegation made in Panel's report was due to a "misunderstanding" with hired consultants, who were dismissed in 1998<ref>Goddard, John. 2003. "Congo corruption charges dropped. Seven Canadian companies placed in 'resolved' file U.N. panel passes case again", ''Toronto Star'', November 02, 2003, pg. F04</ref>.

In 2003, a follow-up United Nations Security Council panel, without any Canadian members, revised the lists according to the degree of resolution achieved by each of the firms and individuals.  In Annex I, seven Canadian companies were categorised as "Resolved - No further action required": American [sic] Mineral Fields AMFI, Banro Corporation, First Quantum Minerals, Harambee Mining Corporation, Kinross Gold Corporation, Melkior Resources, and Tenke Mining Corporation; International Panama [sic] Resources Corp appeared in "Category IV - Pending Cases With Governments For Individuals And Companies", to which was added the remark, "No complaint.

Banro was exempted from the [temporary export] mining ban [in North Kivu, South Kivu, and Maniema provinces], and it recently began construction of its plant at the Twangiza site, approximately 50 miles from Bukavu. The track record of industrial mining in Congo leaves much to be desired, with serious questions regarding the equity of mining contracts and the behavior of international mining companies. But in the Kivus there is hope that industrial mining could provide an alternative to armed groups. Mwamikazi Esperance Baharanyi, traditional queen of the Walungu territory, a territory roughly the size of Rwanda, told Enough that Banro 'represents a positive alternative to artisanal mining in eastern Congo.'

* '''Stratos Inc., ''for Export Development Canada''''', June 2007: "One Canadian mining company described the approach it had taken to develop its property.  It started consulting neighbouring communities two and a half years before the new mine began to work the concession.  A year later, it started to develop community profiles and needs assessments (there are 42 villages on its concession).  It also enrolled the support of local leaders to discourage artisanal mining on its property and followed up by offering replacement jobs to artisanal miners in its own operations, in tree-cutting and in agricultural programs.  These projects were identified by NGOs and were substantial enough that they absorbed many of the displaced artisanal miners.  The company refurbished two primary schools, built a third one and committed to paying teachers for three years.  It helped establish 20 micro-enterprises (e.g., in brick-making and fence-building) and encouraged local manufacturing by buying local products.  It funded skills-training and drilled water wells.  Not confident about how the government would spend royalties once these started flowing, the company has committed to investing 0.3 per cent of revenues to go into a Community Trust Fund which will be jointly administered by the company and the local community [...] Companies face a dilemma because while they do not wish to take on the role of government - and workshop participants agreed that it would be inappropriate for them to do so - they need to participate actively in fighting corruption, improving overall governance and promoting greater equity if they want to ensure political stability and protect their investments.  Ultimately, they need to be able to transfer the social responsibilities they assume to a willing and capable govenment if the country's development is to be sustainable."<ref>Stratos Inc., for Export Development Canada, ''Risks, Responsibilities and Real Benefits: Mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo'', Independent rapporteur<U+2019>s report, including agenda and list of participants, June 19, 2007, Ottawa: Stratos, Inc. p. 9 http://www.edc.ca/english/docs/csr_independent__report_e.pdf  (accessed January 19, 2011).</ref>
