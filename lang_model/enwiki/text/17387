'''Havergal College''' is an independent boarding and day school for girls from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12 in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada.

Named for English [[hymn]] composer, author and humanitarian [[Frances Ridley Havergal]], the school was founded in 1894 by a group of men led by The Honourable H. Blake at its original location on Jarvis Street in Toronto.

The {{convert|22|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus is located at the corner of Avenue Road and Lawrence Avenue in midtown Toronto and facilities include 
an athletic centre with a pool and fitness centre, music studios, a theatre, and computer labs.

Havergal College established the Institute at Havergal in order to offer students a forum for 
community involvement, social leadership and global action. This specially designed program has connections to local and international partners and encourages students to become engaged with issues such as the UN Millennium Development Goals and food security. 

Students that attend the school from kindergarten or grade one to grade twelve (graduation) are known as "survivors". The formal uniform consists of a white blouse with a green and yellow tie, the forest green kilt and knee socks, the forest green blazer, and black Oxfords. For grades 5 and below, students wear a forest green tunic instead of the kilt.   

The Havergal College hockey team plays an annual game against [[Bishop Strachan School]], competing for the Kathleen Hewitt Trophy. 

The school offers Advanced Placement courses and the alumni network includes more than 8,000 Havergal "Old Girls".

Havergal's mission is "preparing young women to make a difference."

==History==
[[File:Miss Ellen Mary Knox by Fraser Bryce, Toronto..jpg|thumb|left|Miss Ellen Mary Knox, first Principal of Havergal College, Toronto]]
Havergal College was founded as a [[Church of England]] Ladies' College, in 1894, under principal Miss Ellen Mary Knox. Miss Knox held a first-class in the final honour examination at the University of Oxford; a Cambridge University diploma in teaching and a First Division Government certificate. Havergal was sister schools with [[Ridley College]] for the first several decades of both schools' history.

In 1899, land was bought and buildings erected for the college. By 1903, Havergal College at 354 Jarvis Street, contained 120 boarders and 200 day girls, a staff of 20 resident teachers, chiefly from English universities, and a number of nonresident visiting teachers. <ref>Morgan, Henry James Types of Canadian women and of women who are or have been connected with Canada : (Toronto, 1903) [http://www.archive.org/details/typesofcanadianw01morguoft]</ref> The original Havergal Ladies' College Building, built in 1898, is now the Margaret McCain Academic Building at the [[National Ballet School of Canada]].
