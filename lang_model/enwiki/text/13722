Futoshi [[torture murder|tortured and murdered]] at least seven people, including two children, between [[1996]] and [[1998]].

The girl, who escaped from him, uncovered his crimes in [[2002]], but Japanese police were unable to discover the remains of the victims. Futoshi murdered his victims with an accomplice named [[Junko Ogata]], who was also the victim of his [[abuse]].

== Early life ==
Futoshi was born in [[Kokura Kita-ku, Kitaky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>|Kokura Kita-ku]], [[Kitaky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>]], [[Fukuoka Prefecture]]. He was doted on by his mother and his grandmother in his childhood. He became a classmate for Junko in his high school, in April 1977. He was a juvenile delinquent and transferred due to living with a junior high school girl, so they didn't see each other well. He married a woman at the age of 19, and had a child. He called one woman after another, so he suddenly called Junko though he didn't meet Junko too much. Although he married another woman, he lied that he would marry Junko. He begun to know her well in 1982. Her mother, Shizumi, wanted the couple to part, but he had sex with Shizumi. He treated Junko violently. Junko attempted to commit suicide in [[1985]], but he made her parted from her family, using the situation that her family hated her suicidal attempt. He begun to live with Junko in [[1985]].<ref name=japantimes>{{cite news |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20050929a1.html |title=Pair to hang for seven murders |publisher=The Japan Times |date=[[2005-08-29]] }}</ref> He established a new company, named the ''World'', selling [[futon]] in 1983, then founded a building in 1985. He begun to give electric shocks to his men on the third floor of the building. He had gotten 180 million [[Japanese yen|yen]] with fraud or blackmail. In [[1992]], he and Junko escaped and they were wanted. They continued to escape from the police.

== Deaths of two people ==
Futoshi committed a false promise of marriage. The victim was a mother, who had a husband and three children. He suggested her to divorce from her husband and she ran away from home in April [[1993]]. She divorced her husband. He insisted that Junko was his sister. Her one child died in September 1993. Two other children were adopted by her father and her former husband in October 1993. He robbed her of 11.8 million yen and the mother died in March [[1994]]. The mother and her one child died mysteriously, but the police wasn't able to prove that Futoshi had killed them.

== Confinement and Murders ==
[[Image:Kunisakihantou.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The Kunisaki Peninsula]]
Futoshi stayed in a room of a condominium in Kitakyushu. In [[1994]], he aimed Kumio Toraya and his daughter<U+2014>who miraculously survived and escaped in 2002. Futoshi drew information from Kumio about his previous convictions and he threatened Kumio. Kumio admitted even his previous conviction which he hadn't committed in reality. Kumio and his daughter were confined in his room. He damaged Kumio with electric shocks. He commanded Kumio's daughter to injure her father. Kumio died in abuse at the age of 34 on [[February 26]], 1996. He forced her to admit that she had murdered her father. He commanded Junko and the girl to subdivide his remains. His remains were thrown away in the Kunisaki Peninsula offing.

In same year, he aimed the next target; a woman who was Kumio's acquaintance. She was deceived by him into the belief that he would marry with her. He insisted that he was a graduate from the [[Kyoto university]]. He robbed her of 5.6 million yen. She and her daughter visited his room and they were confined. She jumped off from the second floor to the ground, and escaped from him in March [[1997]]. She entered a mental hospital and her daughter was released.

In April 1997, Junko begun to work and didn't returned. Futoshi called Junko's family, using her absence. He continued to cheat Shizumi, using sexual intercourses. He said her family that Junko was a principal of killing, and he threatened them. He released false information that he had committed suicide, and he performed his false funeral. The news eased her mind and she returned, but he was alive and violently abused Junko. They gave 63 million yen to him, then they were confined. Futoshi had sex with even Junko's sister, Rieko, who had married. He continued to abuse the women sexually with electric shocks. He controlled the family like the relationships between [[Shoko Asahara]] and his subordinates.

On [[December 21]], 1997, he commanded Junko to damage Junko's father, Takashige, and he died of an electric shock at the age of 61. His abuse made Shizumi's mind insane and she gave strange voices. He commanded them to kill Shizumi, and she was held by Rieko and was strangled by Rieko's husband, Kazuya, around [[January 20]], [[1998]]. She died at the age of 58. His abuse made Rieko's ears defective hearing. He commanded them to kill Rieko, and she was held by Junko's sister's daughter, Aya, and was strangled by Kazuya on [[February 10]], 1998. She died at the age of 33. Kazuya, who directly murdered two people, was exhausted. They confined him in a bathroom, and he starved to death on [[April 13]], 1998. He died at the age of 38. He commanded them to kill Junko's sister's son, Yuki, and he was held by Junko and Kumio's daughter and was strangled by Aya on [[May 17]], 1998. He died at the age of 5. He commanded them to kill Aya, and Futoshi and Junko gave Aya electric shocks<U+2014>Junko, however, denied the girl's testimony and said that her recollections might had altered from a sense of guilt because it was the first murder for the girl<U+2014>and she was strangled by Kumio's daughter on [[June 7]], 1998. She died at the age of 10. All victims' remains were subdivided and were boiled in pots. When they subdivided victims' bodies, inhabitants in the condominium heard noises and smelled the stench. The victims' remains were finally thrown away to [[washroom]]s or the sea. The condominium was renovated right after the murders. He put his murders on Junko, who was the only survivor in her family except her two children.

His crime was continued even after that. In July [[2000]], a mother ran away from her home due to his false promise of marriage. They robbed her of 20 million yen. In August [[2001]], she gave her twins to them. They robbed her of much money as the expense of bringing up children.

== Arrest and Trial ==
Kumio's daughter, who was confined, escaped from Futoshi on [[January 30]], [[2002]], but Futoshi got back the girl on [[February 15]], 2002. Between [[February 16]] and [[March 6]], the girl was abused. On March 6, 2002, the girl escaped from Futoshi again, said the crime and called the police. At that time, she was 17 years old. The police arrested Futoshi and Junko on the next day when they tried to get back the girl. The police protected four children; twins and the couple's two children. They were arrested for murdering Aya on [[September 18]], 2002. They were arrested for murdering Takashige on [[October 12]], 2002. They were arrested for murdering Shizumi on [[December 6]], 2002. They were arrested for murdering Yuki on [[January 11]], [[2003]]. They were arrested for murdering Kumio on [[February 3]], 2003. They were arrested for murdering Eriko on [[February 25]], 2003. They were arrested for murdering Kazuya on [[May 30]], 2003. The girl wasn't accused of murders. Junko became calm and admitted murders, but he insisted his own innocence. There wasn't any physical evidence, so the police mainly used the girl's testimony and Junko's testimony.

On [[September 28]], [[2005]], a district court in Fukuoka sentenced him and Junko to die by hanging.<ref name=japantimes/> The court admitted six cases, but it considered that Takashige had not been killed but been injured of electric shocks resulting in death. The defenses of them made appeals. On [[September 26]], [[2007]], a high count sentenced again Matsunaga to die, but Junko was commuted a death sentence into life imprisonment because the count didn't deny that he had forced her to kill the victims with his [[domestic violence]].

The incident was too atrocious to explain, so [[mass media]] wasn't able to report the details of the incident, but several brave writers, including [[Ryuzo Saki]], wrote the details of the incident.
