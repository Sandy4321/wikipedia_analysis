The '''Biblioteca nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III''' (''[[Vittorio Emanuele III]] [[National Library]]'') is a [[national library]] of [[Italy]].  It occupies the eastern wing of the 18th century [[Royal Palace (Naples)|Palazzo Reale]] in [[Naples]], at 1 [[Piazza del Plebiscito]], and has entrances from piazza Trieste and piazza Trento.  It is funded and organised by the Direzione Generale per i Beni Librari and the [[Ministero per i Beni e le Attivit<U+00E0> Culturali]].

In quantitive terms it is the third largest library in Italy, after the national libraries in  [[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Roma|Rome]] and [[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Firenze|Florence]], with 1,480,747 printed volumes, 319,187 pamphlets, 18,415 manuscripts, more than 8,000 periodicals, 4,500 [[Incunabulum|incunabula]] and the 1,800 Herculaneum papyri<ref>[http://www.statistica.beniculturali.it/rilevazioni/BIBLIOTECHE%20SITO/BIBLIOTECHE%202006/BIBL_TAVOLA2_2006.pdf Ministero dei Beni e delle Attivit<U+00E0> culturali - Official statistics]</ref>.  

==History and collections==
The library was founded at the end of the 18th century in the Palazzo degli Studi (which now houses the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Archeologico]]), with its nucleus formed of books holdings of the [[Palazzo Capodimonte]], the celebrated [[Farnese]] library [[Charles III of Spain|Carlo di Borbone]] had transferred to Naples in 1734).  Opened to the public in 1804 under the name of the Reale Biblioteca di Napoli, in 1816 it became the Reale Biblioteca [[Bourbons|Borbonica]].  Additions to its collection came from abolished religious houses and those confiscated from private collections.  With the [[Risorgimento|unification]] of Italy in 1860 it took up its present name of the Biblioteca Nazionale.  

In [[1910]] the ''Officina dei papiri ercolanensi'' was added to the library - this was the workshop founded by Carlo di Borbone to conserve the [[Villa of the Papyri|papyri]] found in excavations at [[Herculaneum]].  After long debate and on the suggestion and efforts of [[Benedetto Croce]], in 1922 the library was moved to its present location at Palazzo Reale, granted to the library by [[Vittorio Emanuele III]]  (whose name it still bears).  After the transfer, the collections of other important neapolitan libraries were annexed to it, including the ''Biblioteca Brancacciana'' (formed in Rome by cardinal [[Francesco Maria Brancaccio]] in the first half of the 17th century, transferred to Naples, and finally becoming Naples' first public library). 

It suffered during the [[Second World War]] due to the German and Allied occupations of Naples (being set fire to by the Germans in the [[four days of Naples]]), though the most precious manuscripts had been transferred to safer locations and remained there until the library reopened in 1945.  In 1980 a wing of the building was seriously damaged by an earthquake, forcing the library to transfer some of its holdings to another part of the building.
