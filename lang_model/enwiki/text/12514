'''Anthrax''' is an American [[thrash metal]] band from New York City, formed in 1981. The band was one of the most popular of the 1980s thrash metal scene. When thrash metal began to gain a major following in the mid-to-late 1980s, Anthrax were dubbed one of the "big four" of thrash metal alongside [[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]], and [[Slayer]].


==History==
===Early days (1981)===
Anthrax was formed in mid-1981 by guitarists Scott Ian and Danny Lilker. They got the band's name from [[anthrax|the disease]] listed in a biology textbook and claimed it because it sounded "sufficiently evil" to them.<ref>VH1 ''Behind the Music'' Episode 173: Anthrax, March 10, 2002</ref> [[John Connelly (musician)|John Connelly]] jammed with the band, but never actually joined. He was a roadie for them for many of their early shows, and eventually formed [[Nuclear Assault]] with Lilker in 1984. The initial line-up of Anthrax was rounded out by drummer Dave Weiss and bassist Kenny Kushner.  Kushner was not felt to be adequate for the band's needs and was replaced very early by Paul Kahn, but Kahn also did not work out for the band, so Lilker chose to take over on bass and Greg Walls joined as lead guitarist. Vocalist [[Neil Turbin]] joined the group after Ian's 14-year-old brother Jason Rosenfeld was a temporary singer. Weiss soon was replaced by [[Greg D'Angelo]]. Tommy Wise, vocals, was also an early addition to the band but quit before the band was found by the record company.

===Neil Turbin era (1982<U+2013>1984)===
Neil Turbin joined the band in late August 1982 and performed two weeks later at Great Gildersleeves on September 12, 1982. This line-up made frequent live performances in the New York/New Jersey tri-state area. The line-up recorded a [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal|NWOBHM]]-sounding demo in July 1982. Greg Walls left in the summer of 1983, and Bob Berry, who was recommended to Turbin by [[Rhett Forrester]] of [[Riot (band)|Riot]], temporarily replaced him.

Berry's stay was short and he was replaced by Dan Spitz who had previously been with [[New Jersey]] thrashers [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]]. With Spitz, a second demo was recorded. In September, [[Charlie Benante]] replaced Greg D'Angelo. This lineup recorded the "Soldiers of Metal" 7" single, produced by [[Ross the Boss]] of [[Manowar]]. The B-side of this single  was "Howling Furies" from the previous demo recorded with Greg D'Angelo on drums, and is the only official Anthrax recording to feature his work. It was this demo that won the band a recording deal with [[Megaforce Records]]. Anthrax recorded their debut album, ''[[Fistful of Metal]]'', in late 1983. The album garnered some international attention. It was released in January 1984, followed by a US tour, during which tensions grew between Danny Lilker and the rest of the band due to Lilker's non-paying of rehearsal rent, lateness, sloppiness and unprofessional demeanor.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  Lilker was released from the band and he went on to form [[Nuclear Assault]] with former roadie John Connelly. Greg D'Angelo joined [[White Lion]] in 1984.

===Joey Belladonna era (1985<U+2013>1992)===

Charlie Benante's nephew Frank Bello replaced Lilker on bass guitar. Shortly after, in late August 1984, Turbin was fired. [[Matt Fallon]] (who later preceded [[Sebastian Bach]] as vocalist with [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]]) was a temporary replacement and the band also appeared as a four-piece billed as The Diseased, with Scott Ian on vocals. They performed a few [[hardcore punk]] covers.

Vocalist [[Joey Belladonna]] debuted live with the band on February 27, 1985, and an EP titled "[[Armed and Dangerous (album)|Armed and Dangerous]]" was recorded. Some older material was added to fill out the EP including two live tracks from early 1984, and the two songs from the "Soldiers of Metal" 7". Later the same year, Ian, Benante and Danny Lilker colloborated with [[Billy Milano]] to produce the satirical album ''[[Speak English or Die]]'' under the name [[Stormtroopers of Death]].

Anthrax's next album, ''[[Spreading the Disease]]'', came out in the same year and was followed by US and European touring. The follow-up album ''[[Among the Living]]'', recorded during 1986 and released in March 1987, developed the band's humorous and more experimental side. Anthrax radically departed from the "traditional" heavy metal look in favour of brightly colored "surfer" jam shorts style of appearance and began a lyrical trend that focused on movies, comic books and [[Stephen King]] novels, elements that became typical for fans to expect. "I Am the Law" is a tribute to comic book hero [[Judge Dredd]]. "Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.)" ("nise fukin life" spelt backwards) is about comedian [[John Belushi]]'s drug addiction and death. "Indians" and the [[mosh pit]] anthem "[[Caught in a Mosh]]" are still considered Anthrax classics today. The album was dedicated to the memory of [[Cliff Burton]], the early [[Metallica]] bass player. "I Am the Law" was issued as a single, backed with "I'm the Man", a song that combined [[rap music|rap]] with metal, and Anthrax toured Europe with Metallica and [[Metal Church]].

Anthrax stuck to its [[thrash metal]] formula on the 1988 album ''[[State of Euphoria]]''. The single "[[Antisocial (song)|Antisocial]]", originally by French heavy metal band [[Trust (band)|Trust]], soon became a staple on MTV in regular rotation as well as on ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''. The group continued to expand its horizons by touring the US with funk metal band [[Living Colour]]; the previous year they further indulged their appreciation for rap by appearing on the title track of [[U.T.F.O.]]'s album ''Lethal''.

In 1989, MTV held a contest in which the winner would get to have the band come to their home and trash it. The contest was won by a female fan, and the band subsequently came to her house and caused havoc. This was the inspiration for the band's 1992 appearance on ''[[Married... with Children]]'', where the main characters of the show win a similar television contest.

In 1990, Anthrax released the more serious ''[[Persistence of Time]]'' to even greater success than ''State of Euphoria''. The album was considerably darker, more technical and progressive than Anthrax's previous work. This struck a chord with metal fans who had been previously wary of embracing the band because of their "silly" side. The biggest single off the album was a cover of [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson]]'s "Got the Time". Jackson himself even claimed that he enjoyed Anthrax's cover version of his song.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} "In My World" and "Belly of the Beast" were also successful.

During 1991 they collaborated with pioneering rap artists [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] on a joint version of "[[Bring the Noise]]". This was a hit, and the band played a successful joint tour with Public Enemy.

===John Bush era (1992<U+2013>2004)===
The EP "[[Attack of the Killer B's]]" was recorded during 1991, featuring a new version of "I'm the Man" and a cover of "Bring the Noise" on which Scott Ian did the vocals. A short time later during 1992, Joey Belladonna was fired from Anthrax.

He was replaced by [[John Bush (singer)|John Bush]], formerly of [[Armored Saint]] who had recently disbanded. Ten years earlier, Bush had been approached by [[Metallica]] to sing for them. The band also left Island Records and signed with [[Elektra Records]] to release ''[[Sound of White Noise]]'' in 1993.

Though it was quite a change from their earlier work with a dark, rockier feel, ''Sound of White Noise'' received mostly positive reviews and [[Only (Anthrax song)|"Only"]] was a major hit (in the liner notes for ''[[Return of the Killer A's]]'', Ian says [[James Hetfield]] once told him it was a "perfect song"). In keeping with the band's eye for unlikely collaborations, classical composer [[Angelo Badalamenti]] provided music for the track "Black Lodge," a tribute to the TV show "[[Twin Peaks]]". Importantly, the album demonstrated that Anthrax had at last shed its sometimes cartoonish outlook in favor of mature, thoughtful songwriting, a trend which had begun on the previous album ''[[Persistence of Time]]''.

During the hiatus between ''Sound of White Noise'' and ''[[Stomp 442]]'', longtime guitarist [[Dan Spitz]] left the band to quit music and become a [[watchmaker]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spitzwatch.com/bio/|title=Dan Spitz Bio|last=Spitz|first=Dan|publisher=spitzwatch|accessdate=September 30, 2009}}</ref> leaving Anthrax officially a quartet for years. In 1995, the band released ''[[Stomp 442]],'', on which Charlie Benante played much of the lead guitar parts, assisted by Paul Crook <U+2013> who would become the band's touring lead guitarist for several years <U+2013> and [[Dimebag Darrell]] from [[Pantera]]. Elektra refused to provide real promotion for the album and it quickly disappeared without a trace. Upset at what they felt was an attempt by the label to kill the album, Anthrax severed ties with Elektra.

Anthrax signed with independent label Ignition Records for the 1998 release ''[[Volume 8: The Threat Is Real]]'' that once again saw Benante playing lead guitar alongside Crook and Dimebag. Pantera's [[Phil Anselmo]] also guested. Unfortunately, almost immediately after the album's release, the label went bankrupt and disappeared, making the album difficult to find. Regrouping, the band signed Beyond Records and released the greatest-hits album ''[[Return of the Killer A's]]'', although Beyond soon went out of business as well. During this period, a two-vocalist tour featuring both [[Joey Belladonna]] and John Bush was proposed and set to go, until Belladonna decided to pull out at the last minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/Anthrax-Summer2003.htm |title=Anthrax Interviews with Scott Ian and John Bush |publisher=Metal-Rules.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-19}}</ref>

During the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] in the United States, the band altered its website to provide information about the [[Anthrax|disease]] after people began simply typing ''anthrax.com'' into their browsers. Amid what could have become a [[public relations|PR]] nightmare for the band, Anthrax issued a press release on October 10, 2001, that jokingly mentioned that they were going to change the name of the band to "something more friendly, like 'Basket Full of Puppies'."<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20041108091742/http://www.anthrax.com/html/ANTHRAX_PressRelease.htm A N T H R A X <U+2013> Press Release<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> They later sank all name-change rumors that erupted from the press release at the [[New York Steel]] 9/11 [[benefit concert]] in November 2001, when they took the stage wearing boiler suits with a different word on each one that spelled out the sentence "WE'RE NOT CHANGING OUR NAME". A picture of the band wearing the suits can be seen on the inner tray card of ''We've Come for You All.''

Despite the hardships and various legal entanglements regarding who had the rights to certain albums, Anthrax managed to continue. In 2001, new lead guitarist [[Rob Caggiano]] joined, and two years later, the band released ''[[We've Come for You All]]'', through [[Sanctuary Records]]<U+2014>an album hailed by the metal press as a return to form.

In early 2004, the band returned to the studio to record ''[[The Greater of Two Evils]]''<U+2014>a "live in the studio" re-recording of the band's early work with the then-current lineup. Shortly afterward, bassist Frank Bello announced he was leaving the band to join [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]] and was replaced for touring purposes by [[Fates Warning]] and former Armored Saint member [[Joey Vera]].

===''Among the Living'' reunion (2005<U+2013>2007)===
On April 1, 2005, the band announced that the ''[[Among the Living]]'' lineup of Scott Ian, Charlie Benante, Dan Spitz, Joey Belladonna, and Frank Bello would be reforming. On some dates of the resultant tour, they performed ''Among the Living'' in its entirety for the first time. At the conclusion of the tour, it was expected the reformed line-up would begin a new album, but on January 24, 2007, Scott Ian posted a message to [[Blabbermouth.net]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=65860|title=Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian: 'The reunion is over'|date=January 24, 2007|work=Blabbermouth.net|publisher=Roadrunner Records|accessdate=January 14, 2010}}</ref> <blockquote>
Finally, we're going back to work. We're going to Chicago to work our asses off and write a record. [...] One problem... no singer. We were offered a direct support slot on a major tour this spring and Joey [Belladonna] decided he did not want to move forward. The reunion is over. We tried to make it work but I guess that's the problem, you can't 'make' something work. [...] My curiosity was piqued by the idea of what Anthrax would sound like now with Joey singing. Over the last few months we've discussed this endlessly to no avail. The problems that were there could not be fixed no matter how hard we tried and in the end Joey made the decision.
</blockquote>

Following that announcement, speculation was cast over whether John Bush would return. Bush had stated on February 7 that he was not ready to commit to Anthrax again.<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=66627 BLABBERMOUTH.NET <U+2013> Singer JOHN BUSH: 'I Am Not Ready' To Commit To ANTHRAX Again<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In May 2007, [[Scott Ian]] said that the announcement of who will be singing for Anthrax would be made at the end of June, though the actual announcement didn't come until December.

In June 2007, Bush was interviewed by ''[[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]]'' about being asked to return to Anthrax, and whether or not he was bitter about the reunion. He replied:

<blockquote>"No. Bitter is not the way I wanna be about anything. I'm not bitter at all. There was probably not a perfect way to do that, what they did. It was like, how are they gonna say...? I mean, they asked me to do it<U+2014>the tour with Joey<U+2014>and it just wasn't right for me, I couldn't do it. So, whatever...if they felt they had to do that, I understand. It wasn't like I was going, 'Yeah, do it. That's great.' But once it happened, I was like, 'okay.' It was like a book ended. It's okay. I mean, it's much better to look at it that way than to be angry or frustrated, 'cause I really don't feel that way."</blockquote>

When asked if he was approached to rejoin the band once Belladonna left the group, Bush said,

<blockquote>"I was asked to write, and it just wasn't right for me. I couldn't go back and say, 'Here I am...' It would be like coming in with my tail between my legs, and that's not right for me. I just couldn't do that. It just didn't feel right to do that. It was about soul, your gut. How does that feel? Does it feel right? Good enough. Sold. Answer." </blockquote>

Bush subsequently did appear with Anthrax for Sonisphere 2009 festival in the UK. Due to the overwhelming fan response following his performance, a 'Bring Back Bush' campaign was set up and subsequently endorsed by Scott Ian.<ref name="metalhammer.co.uk">{{cite web

On December 10, 2007, it was announced the band's new vocalist would be [[Dan Nelson]], formerly of Devilsize.<ref>{{cite web |title=It's Official: Anthrax Taps Former Devilsize Singer |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=86515 |date=December 10, 2007 |work= |publisher=blabbermouth.net |accessdate=July 22, 2009}}</ref> Around the same time, it was confirmed that Rob Caggiano would return as lead guitarist.

On May 28, 2008 Anthrax played their first show in 19 months at The [[Double Door]] in Chicago. Along with new singer Nelson, the band played new material which was well received by the sold-out crowd despite some equipment problems. Anthrax then played in South Korea for the first time on August 17, 2008.

On Saturday March 7, 2009 Anthrax played [[Bogota, Colombia]] for the first time in their career, opening for [[Iron Maiden]]. Then, on July 21, 2009 manager Izvor Zivkovic confirmed the departure of Dan Nelson, due to illness. Nelson has since denied this, saying: "I was never seriously ill or sick at all, as reported in Anthrax<U+2019>s 7/17/09 press release. This extremely inflammatory statement hurt me tremendously. This statement misled fans, friends and family members into believing that I was seriously ill when I was not. I was not aware such a statement was being issued and it came as a total shock to me, as I<U+2019>m sure it did to all of you. It was the other band members<U+2019> decision to cancel the tour dates, not mine. I was ready, willing and able to do my job. After issuing the press release the other band members decided, on their own accord, that I had 'resigned' from the band. I never resigned from the band.".<ref>[http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=46409 Metal News <U+2013> Ex-Anthrax Singer Dan Nelson Claims He Wasn't Ill (Metal Underground.com)]</ref>

===Reunion With John Bush (2009-2010)===
[[File:Anthrax-sonisphere-2009006.jpg|thumb|right|Anthrax performing in August 2009 at Knebworth, England.]]
All following performances were canceled, except the UK [[Sonisphere]] Festival in August 2009, with [[John Bush (musician)|John Bush]] performing vocals.

On September 3, 2009, it was announced that John Bush would be yet again singing with Anthrax at the Loud Park '09 Festival in Japan  on October 17.<ref>{{cite web |title=ANTHRAX Featuring JOHN BUSH To Perform At Japan's LOUD PARK Festival |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=126423|date=September 3, 2009 |work= |publisher=blabbermouth.net |accessdate=September 3, 2009}}</ref>

Anthrax with John Bush also took part in the February 2010, 5-show touring Soundwave 2010 festival in Australia. Soon after, Benante said that the band is "in the process of regrouping with [Bush]. We played two shows with him, and we are looking forward to proceeding with this lineup."<ref>[http://www.buzzgrinder.com/2009/anthrax-john-bush/ Anthrax and John Bush Might Be Back Together]</ref>

Anthrax has also confirmed a "big 4 tour" (with Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer) as part of the 2010 [[Sonisphere]] festival. This will be the first time that all four bands have played together.<ref>[http://www.thrashhits.com/2009/12/metallica-have-confirmed-the-big-four-will-tour-sonisphere-festival/ Metallica have confirmed The Big Four will tour Sonisphere Festival!]</ref>

In an interview with metalsucks.com John Bush said- "we just did these shows in Australia that were really fun. They were for the Soundwave Festival, and they were great. I had committed to doing these shows to these four shows in June as well as more festivals in August. As of now we<U+2019>re trying to figure out a way to see if we can re-record some of the songs that the band had already recorded [for [[Worship Music]]]. We<U+2019>re just trying to iron out some of the legalities on it. That<U+2019>s where we are at today."

When asked if he would be re-recording some of Dan Nelson<U+2019>s vocals he stated "That is what they want to do, and it<U+2019>s been a conflict for me, to be quite frank, simply because I kind of felt like I wasn<U+2019>t part of the creation of it. On all the other Anthrax records, I was part of it when it happened. I just wasn<U+2019>t involved in this, and it<U+2019>s something that they<U+2019>ve already actually completed. I haven<U+2019>t disregarded it completely, and I know it<U+2019>s important to them. I realize they made this record and they<U+2019>re kind of sitting on it. They want to put some of it out, if not everything<U+2026> at least a single, and we<U+2019>ve talked about [releasing] an EP. We<U+2019>re still trying to figure out if we can do that, especially in conjunction with these shows in June. We<U+2019>ve just got to kind of iron out some specifics. That<U+2019>s where we<U+2019>re at today, March 15, 2010."

===Reunion with Joey Belladonna (2010-present)===

It is confirmed that Joey Belladonna will return to Anthrax for the shows in summer 2010 as well as a new album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=139800&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blabbermouth+%28Blabbermouth.net%27s+Daily+Headlines%29&utm_content=Twitter |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - It's Official: JOEY BELLADONNA Rejoins ANTHRAX For Tour, Studio Album |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-19}}</ref>
Anthrax, along with Metallica, Slayer, and Megadeth performed on the same bill for the first time on June 16, 2010 at Bemowo Airport (Warsaw, Poland). It was the first performance of that bands played as a part of Sonisphere Festival series, one of the following (Sofia, Bulgaria, June 22, 2010) was sent via satellite in HD to cinemas.<ref>http://www.billboard.com/news/metallica-heading-to-cinemas-1004097367.story#/news/metallica-heading-to-cinemas-1004097367.story</ref> They also went on to play in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]] (June 26, 2010) and then in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] (June 27, 2010) , [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] (August 7, 2010),and last in [[Pori]], [[Finland]] (August 8, 2010) also as part of the Sonisphere Festival.

==Side projects==
Several members have launched affiliated side projects, such as [[Scott Ian]]'s project with Anthrax drummer Charlie Benante, the original Anthrax bassist/lead guitarist [[Danny Lilker]] and [[Billy Milano]] called [[Stormtroopers of Death]]. After leaving Anthrax, [[Joey Belladonna]] began a series of solo albums: Belladonna, [[Spells of Fear]], and 03. [[John Bush (singer)|John Bush]] is involved with his former band [[Armored Saint]], while original Anthrax vocalist Neil Turbin has been touring Japan, Europe, Mexico and US with his band Deathriders. Neil Turbin's debut album, "Back With A Vengeance", was released in 2009. [[Scott Ian]] and [[Rob Caggiano]] are currently in a side project called [[The Damned Things]] with members of [[Fall Out Boy]] and [[Every Time I Die]].

==Guest musicians==
A number of Anthrax albums have featured guests, most notably [[Dimebag Darrell]], who appeared on "King Size" and "Riding Shotgun" from ''[[Stomp 442]]''; "Inside Out" and "Born Again Idiot" from ''[[Volume 8: The Threat Is Real]]''; and "Strap It On" and "Cadillac Rock Box" from ''[[We've Come for You All]]''. Vocalist [[Roger Daltrey]] of [[The Who]] has also appeared on the band's ''[[We've Come for You All]]'' disc, providing backing vocals for "[[Taking the Music Back]]". [[Phil Anselmo]] of [[Pantera]] appears on ''Volume 8: The Threat Is Real'', on the song "Killing Box." [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] worked with Anthrax on a metal version of "Bring the Noise" from Public Enemy's album "[[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back]]".
