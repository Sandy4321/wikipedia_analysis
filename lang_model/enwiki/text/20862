'''''Leberecht Maass'' (Z-1)''' was a [[German World War II destroyers|Type 1934]] [[destroyer]] in the German [[Kriegsmarine]], named after Rear Admiral [[Leberecht Maass]] who commanded German forces in the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight]] in August 1914.

She was launched on 18 August 1935 at ''[[Deutsche Werke]]'' in [[Kiel]] and entered service on 14 January 1937. The ship displaced 3,156 tons, had a length of 119.3 m and a beam of 11.3 m, and could steam at 38.2 knots. The armament comprised five 12.7 cm guns in single turrets, four [[3.7 cm FlaK 43|3.7 cm AA guns]], six [[2 cm FlaK 30|2 cm Anti-aircraft guns]], and eight 53.3 cm [[torpedo tube]]s.  The crew numbered about 325.

==Service history==
On 3 September 1939, Z1 ''Leberecht Maass'' and {{ship|German destroyer|Z9 Wolfgang Zenker||2}} took part in an attack on the Polish ships {{ship|ORP|Gryf||2}} and {{ship|ORP|Wicher|1928|2}} in [[Gdynia]] harbour, and ''Leberecht Maass'' was hit in a gun shield and suffered her first four war deaths (the German ships caused only minor damage to the ''Gryf''). It is not clear if ''Leberecht Maass'' was hit by the ''Gryf'' or the Polish 152 mm coastal battery at [[Hel, Poland|Hel]].

In early 1940, the ship was part of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla in the [[North Sea]]. On 22 February 1940, ''Leberecht Maass'' and five other destroyers sailed for the [[Dogger Bank]] to intercept British fishing vessels in "[[Operation Wikinger]]". En route, the flotilla was erroneously attacked by a [[Luftwaffe]] bomber. ''Leberecht Maass'' was hit by one bomb, lost steering and strayed into a British [[minefield]]. The ship hit a mine and broke in half, sinking with the loss of 282 of her crew. Only 60 were saved. During the rescue effort, [[German destroyer Z3 Max Schultz|Z3 ''Max Schultz'']] also hit a mine and sank with her entire crew.
