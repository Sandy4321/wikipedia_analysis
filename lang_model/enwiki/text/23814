'''Timothy James "Tim" Pawlenty''' ({{IPA-en|p<U+0259><U+02C8>l<U+025B>nti|pron}};<ref>{{cite web|author=ctash |url=http://www.ap.org/Minnesota/prono.html |title=Minnesota Pronunciation Guide |publisher=Ap.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref> born November 27, 1960) is an American politician who served as the [[List of Governors of Minnesota|39th]] [[Governor of Minnesota]] (2003<U+2013>2011). He is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 election]]. He previously served in the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]] (1993<U+2013>2003) where he served two terms as [[Minnesota House Majority Leader|majority leader]].

Pawlenty was born in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] and raised in nearby [[South St. Paul, Minnesota|South St. Paul]]. He graduated from [[University of Minnesota]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[political science]] and earned a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from the [[University of Minnesota Law School]]. His early career included working as a labor law attorney and the vice president of a software company. After settling in the city of [[Eagan, Minnesota|Eagan]] with his wife, Pawlenty was appointed to the city's Planning Commission and was elected to the Eagan City Council at the age of 28. He won a seat as a state representative in 1992, representing District 38B in suburban [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]]. He was re-elected four times, and voted majority leader by House Republicans in 1998.

He won a narrow Republican primary in 2002 followed by a three-way election for Governor of Minnesota. His platform focused on balancing the budget without raising taxes. He was re-elected in 2006 by a margin of less than one percent. Pawlenty eliminated his state's budget deficit using spending cuts and borrowing heavily from earmarked funds. His administration advocated for numerous public works projects, including work on the Northstar Commuter Rail Line, and the construction of [[Target Field]], a [[Major League Baseball]] stadium in [[Minneapolis]]. He signed a bill mandating 20% [[gasohol|ethanol in gasoline]] by 2013. He cut health care spending to help balance the budget, and signed an executive order rejecting federal funds related to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. He led worldwide trips for business leaders and trade delegations to explore trade opportunities. In 2007 and 2008 he served as chairman of the [[National Governors Association]].

Pawlenty was rumored as a contender for president as early as 2005, and was closely involved with U.S. Senator [[John McCain]]'s presidential campaign in 2008. Pawlenty began early steps toward a presidential campaign in late 2009. He formally announced his candidacy in May 2011, running on a strongly [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] platform.

Pawlenty was elected to the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]] in 1992, winning 49 percent of the vote in District 38B (suburban [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]]). He was reelected four times and was chosen House Majority Leader when the Republicans became the majority party in the State Legislature in 1998.<ref name="MNLegRef">{{cite web|title=Legislators Past and Present|publisher=Minnesota Legislative Reference Library|url=http://www.leg.state.mn.us/legdb/fulldetail.asp?ID=10512|accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>

===2002 gubernatorial campaign===
{{Main|Minnesota gubernatorial election, 2002}}
In 2002, Pawlenty wanted to run for governor, but party leaders made it clear that they favored businessman [[Brian Sullivan]] for that office.<ref name="MPR2002" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200206/12_mccalluml_sullivan/|title=Campaign 2002 profile: Brian Sullivan|author=By Laura McCallum|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|date=June 12, 2002}}</ref> Pawlenty shifted his sights to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] but he abandoned those plans when [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] asked him to step aside to allow former St. Paul mayor [[Norm Coleman]] to challenge Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] without Republican primary opposition.<ref>{{cite news|author=Smith, Dane |title=Cheney advises Pawlenty not to run for Senate; Majority leader bows to request from White House |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-73416464.html|publisher=Star Tribune |date=2001-04-19|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> Pawlenty reasserted his original gubernatorial ambition and won a hard-fought and very narrow victory over Sullivan in the Republican party primary election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200209/13_mccalluml_pawlentyprofile/|title=Tim Pawlenty|author=By Laura McCallum|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|date=2002-09-13}}</ref>

In the general election, Pawlenty faced two strong opponents. His main rival was veteran [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]] (DFL) state senator [[Roger Moe]]. Former Democratic Congressman [[Tim Penny]] ran on the Independence Party ticket. In September 2002, the three were essentially tied in the polls. Pawlenty's major campaign stances included: a pledge not to raise [[tax]]es to balance the state's [[budget deficit]]; that [[visa (document)|visa]] expiration dates be required to be printed on [[driver's license]]s; that women seeking an [[abortion]] be required to wait at least 24 hours; enactment of a [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed carry gun law]]; and reform of the state's [[education]] requirements. Pawlenty won the election. His largest gains after the September three way tie were reportedly among voters in the suburbs of [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul|Minneapolis-St. Paul]].

===2006 reelection campaign===
{{Main|Minnesota gubernatorial election, 2006}}

The 2006 gubernatorial race included [[Minnesota Attorney General]] [[Mike Hatch]], of the [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|DFL]],  [[Peter Hutchinson]] of the [[Independence Party of Minnesota|Independence Party]], and [[Ken Pentel]] of the [[Green Party of Minnesota|Green Party]]. Pawlenty won, defeating Hatch by a margin of less than one percent, though both the state House and Senate gained DFL majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2006/11/07/mngov/|title=Hatch concedes; Pawlenty barely wins re-election|author=by Laura McCallum|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|date=November 8, 2006}}</ref>

He thinks the [[United States Supreme Court]] decided ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' wrongly. He opposes [[same-sex marriage]] and [[civil unions]]. He would like to reinstate "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" should he become president. Answering a question from talk radio host [[Bryan Fischer]], he replied, "...

In December 2010, Pawlenty was one of three U.S. governors who publicly declared solidarity with Christian-right group [[Family Research Council]].<ref name=FRC>{{cite news|author=Duffy, J.P.|title=FRC, Members of Congress, Governors, and Conservative Leaders Release Open Letter Calling for Civil Debate, End to Character Assassination|url=http://www.frc.org/pressrelease/frc-members-of-congress-governors-and-conservative-leaders-release-open-letter-calling-for-civil-debate-end-to-character-assassination|date=December 15, 2010|accessdate=January 30, 2011}}</ref>

Pawlenty's tour has been in Minneapolis, San Francisco and Dallas, and it ends January in Iowa where the Iowa Caucuses are scheduled for February 6, 2012.  "That will come up fast," he said, "if I do run." In Minneapolis, speaking to Pat Kessler of [[WCCO-TV]] who asked about his feelings regarding a potential run for president by [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Michele Bachmann]], "I have a lot of respect for Michele Bachmann <U+2026> Whether she runs or not, it<U+2019>s gonna be a big field. There<U+2019>s gonna be five, six, seven, eight people running <U+2026> Whoever wants to run can run. The more, the merrier."<ref name=Weiner />

In a December 2010 column in the Wall Street Journal, Pawlenty argued in favor of the historical benefits of "private sector" [[labor unions]] and strongly against "public sector" labor unions, whose collective bargaining rights he would like to see curbed: "The rise of the labor movement in the early 20th century was a triumph for America<U+2019>s working class.

He also criticized modern unions: "The moral case for unions<U+2014>protecting working families from exploitation<U+2014>does not apply to public employment...

===State budget===
Pawlenty was elected in 2002 on a platform of balancing the state's budget without raising taxes.

During his first year as governor, Pawlenty balanced a deficit of $4.3&nbsp;billion without raising taxes, primarily by reducing the rate of funding increases for state services, including funding for transportation, social services, and welfare. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} During his second term, Pawlenty erased a $2.7 billion deficit by cutting spending, shifting payments and using one-time money<ref name=Scheck-MPR /> and the state department of Management and Budget estimates that the two-year budget beginning July 2011 is $4.4 billion short.<ref name=Scheck-MPR>{{cite news|author=Scheck, Tom|title=Pawlenty downplaying budget deficit predictions|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/09/23/pawlenty-economy/|date=September 24, 2009|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|accessdate=2009-09-24}}</ref>

Former Minnesota Governor [[Arne Carlson]], an Independent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], criticized Pawlenty's budget strategy: he borrowed more than $1 billion from the tobacco settlement (money set aside for heath care), borrowed more than $1.4 billion from K-12 education funding, borrowed more than $400 [million]<ref>AEI said "billion", an error see original: {{cite news|author=Carlson, Arne|date=May 23, 2011|title=The Presidency: A Bit Short Is Pawlenty|url=http://govarnecarlson.blogspot.com/2011_05_01_archive.html|publisher=Blogspot|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}</ref> from the Health Care Access Fund for low-income families, among other short-term shifts in accounting.

====Minnesota Supreme Court case====

After the court ruling, as the 2010 legislative session drew to a close, Pawlenty vetoed a tax bill that would have raised taxes. Taking his case to the people of Minnesota, he criticized Democrats for attempting to raise taxes in the midst of an extremely difficult economic situation. Eventually, due in part to the efforts of House Speaker Margaret Kelliher, who was running for the 2010 Democratic nomination for governor of Minnesota, the General Assembly passed legislation approving nearly all the original unallotments.

In June 2006, Pawlenty signed a $999.9&nbsp;million public works bill that included funding for additional work on the [[Northstar Corridor|Northstar Commuter rail line]] (a change in position from reservations about the idea he initially expressed), an expanded [[Faribault, Minnesota|Faribault]] [[Minnesota Correctional Facility <U+2013> Faribault|prison]], a bioscience building at the [[University of Minnesota]], and science facilities at [[Minnesota State University, Mankato|Minnesota State University]] in Mankato.

After the failure and repeal of the ''Profiles of Learning'' [[K-12|Kindergarten through 12th grade]] graduation requirements in a previous session, Pawlenty sought to reinstate them during his governorship{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

Pawlenty used an accounting change called a tax shift to balance the state deficit without raising taxes. School districts statewide may unexpectedly lose $58 million in interest and reserve revenue.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In 2010, Pawlenty vetoed a bill (HF 3164), which the legislature had passed 110 to 20, calling for Minnesota State Colleges & Universities (MnSCU) to revamp its credit transferring system within five years to fix "minimal loss of credits for transferring students" who had been losing between 10 and 30 percent of their credits.<ref name=Schumacher>{{cite news|author=Schumacher, Lawrence|date=May 3, 2010|url=http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/news/2010/05/03/pawlenty-nixes-college-student-credit-transfer-fix|title=Pawlenty nixes college student credit transfer fix|work=Twin Cities Daily Planet|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}</ref> Pawlenty found it "unnecessary" because MnSCU was fixing their system already "through internal actions and policy changes".<ref name=Schumacher />

Pawlenty favored raising fees and imposing toll lanes on roads as the primary means of discouraging excessive traffic. During his term, the [[carpool lane]]s of [[Interstate 394]] leading into downtown Minneapolis were converted into [[high-occupancy toll]] lanes.

In vetoing the expenditure, Pawlenty did not consult Peter Bell, head of the [[Metropolitan Council|Metro Council]] and project leader.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sturdevant|first=Lori|title=Working toward the train in vain|publisher=Minneapolis Star Tribune|date=2008-04-12|url=http://www.startribune.com/opinion/commentary/17563464.html?page=1&c=y|accessdate=2008-04-25}}</ref> Pawlenty stated that he vetoed the bill in order to send a message to the Legislature, which had exceeded his initial budget request, that they needed to "stay focused, be fiscally disciplined, set priorities and solve this budget crisis in a fiscally disciplined way."<ref name="CCSetback">{{cite web|last=Yuen|first=Laura|coauthors=Tom Scheck|title=Pawlenty delivers a setback to the Central Corridor project|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|date=2008-04-07|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/04/07/vetofollow/|accessdate=2008-04-25}}</ref> Pawlenty however was supportive of the project and had requested the money in the bonding bill he submitted to the Minnesota State Legislature.<ref name="CCSetback" /> The veto disappointed some of Minnesota's congressional representatives in Washington, including Minnesota's Republican Senator [[Norm Coleman]], who pledged to "raise my voice as strong as I can, as loud as I can.

There were Republican state legislators who supported other cuts of the bonding bill, including Doug Magnus, the ranking Republican on the House Transportation Finance Division, who praised Pawlenty's "fiscal responsibility."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/state/17878864.html?page=2&c=y|title=Met Council head is in a political bind|publisher=www.startribune.com|date=2008-04-18|accessdate=2008-04-25|last=Kaszuba |first=Mike}}</ref> Critics, including [[Chris Coleman (politician)|Chris Coleman]], Mayor of Saint Paul, called Pawlenty's veto "political gamesmanship," seeing the move as retribution for the Legislature's successful override of Pawlenty's veto of a transportation bonding bill.<ref name="CCSetback" /> They noted cuts overwhelmingly targeted Democratic districts, and Democratic stronghold Saint Paul most heavily.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.twincities.com/politics/2008/04/vetoes_not_political.html|title=Vetoes not political?

===Crime===
According to a single report in the ''[[Star Tribune]]'', "A report on Minnesota's sex-offender program delivered to legislators in the final days of the Pawlenty administration was heavily edited by a top political appointee to reflect the former governor's skepticism about the effectiveness of treatment and to delete arguments for expanded community resources for offenders."<ref>Ludeman, Cal (2011-02-07) [http://www.startribune.com/politics/local/115534414.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUvDEhiaE3miUsZ Details on sex offender program deleted], ''[[Star Tribune]]''</ref>

Minnesota has mandated a 10% mixture of [[gasoline]] and [[ethanol]] ([[gasohol]]) since 1997. Pawlenty signed into law in May 2005 a bill that will raise the minimum mandated mixture to 20% in 2013. Pawlenty has also lobbied the Governors' Ethanol Coalition to mandate higher ethanol use nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|last=McCallum |first=Laura |title=Pawlenty pumps ethanol|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|date=2005-09-26|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/09/26_mccalluml_ethanol/|accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref>

[[Conservatism in the United States|Conservative]] Republican governors were not supportive of Pawlenty's presentation on [[clean energy]] to the governor's association, which he gave in cooperation with [[Ed Rendell]], who is the [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|governor of Pennsylvania]] and the National Governors Association's Democratic vice-chairman. With [[Kathleen Sebelius]] of Kansas, Pawlenty is cochairman of the association's energy committee. The effort received "adamant opposition" from governors of [[petroleum]] (oil) producing [[States of the United States|states]].<ref name=Novak />

===Health===
In 2004, Minnesota's [[Star Tribune]] newspaper opined that the credibility of Pawlenty's commissioner of health, Dianne Mandernach, suffered when a website posting by the department suggested that abortion might have a role in breast cancer. She also angered many when it was learned she had delayed releasing government research on cancer in miners.<ref>{{cite news

In 2005, Pawlenty asked a U.S. Senate subcommittee to allow his [[MinnesotaCare]] health plan to expand and continue allowing state residents and employees to import cheaper Canadian prescription drugs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/02/16_scheckt_drugimports/|title=Measuring the success of Canadian drug imports|author=by Tom Scheck|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|date=2005-02-16|accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref>

In 2007, Pawlenty signed into law the 2007 Omnibus Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill, which provided funding for the Health Care Transformation Task Force, a panel of health care experts charged with exploring ways to reduce health care spending, improve quality, and ensure that Minnesota develops a universal health care plan by 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kff.org/uninsured/upload/State-Health-Reform1.pdf|title=The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured|author=|publisher=The Henry J.

He has recently used health care funding cuts as a mechanism to balance the state budget.  After years of assuring doctors that the state sick tax would only be used to fund health welfare programs, in 2009 Pawlenty recommended a 3% cut in physician reimbursements from the state and asked that the sick tax be put instead into the state's general budget.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnmed.org/News/NewsFullStory/tabid/2266/ArticleID/3246/CBModuleId/3348/Default.aspx |title=Pawlenty uses veto power to cut health care |publisher=Mnmed.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref> Pawlenty used a line-item veto to remove $381 million from health and human services funding, which could lead to 35,000 Minnesotans losing their General Assistance Medical Care (GAMC) health insurance in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|author=Scheck, Tom|title=Pawlenty, lawmakers remain at odds over budget issues|date=May 15, 2009|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/05/15/lawmakers_assess_impact_of_pawlentys_budget_vetoes/|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio News|accessdate=2009-06-02}}</ref> [[Hennepin County Medical Center]]<U+2014>the largest provider of health care to Minnesota's poor and uninsured<U+2014>closed two clinics, reduced its staff and reduced access to non-emergency services.<ref>{{cite news|author=Williams, Chris (Associated Press)|date=November 18, 2009|title=HCMC approves big cuts in 2010 budget|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/11/18/hcmc-to-adopt-2010-budget-deep-cuts-expected/|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref> State Senator [[Linda Berglin]] wrote a bill that would extend GAMC funding, which the Senate is considering.<ref>{{cite news|author=McIntee, Mike|title=Vets To Feel Governor Pawlenty's GAMC Cuts|url=http://the-uptake.groups.theuptake.org/en/videogalleryView/id/2794/|date=February 9, 2010|publisher=The Uptake|accessdate=February 10, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In 2010, he refused federal health care funds including more than $1 billion to expand the number of Minnesotans covered by Medicaid, $68 million for a high-risk insurance pool, $1 million to help set up an insurance exchange where consumers could shop for health coverage, and $850,000 for teenage pregnancy prevention. Pawlenty accepted a $500,000 abstinence-only sex education grant that will require $350,000 in matching state money. Pawlenty said, "It doesn't say we have to apply for all of them."<ref name=Marcotty>{{cite news|title=Pawlenty restricts health money|author=Marcotty, Josephine and Stassen-Berger, Rachel E.|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/state/101940198.html|date=September 1, 2010|work=Star Tribune|accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref>

===Foreign relations===

[[Image:Tim Pawlenty kosovo2.jpg|thumb|left|Tim Pawlenty meeting [[Minnesota National Guard]] troops in [[Kosovo]] (April 12th 2008)]]
Pawlenty took a delegation of nearly 200 Minnesotan business, government, academic and civic leaders on a weeklong trip to [[China]] in mid-November 2005. The stated objectives were to provide a forum for companies to acquire market information, assess market potential, evaluate market entry strategies and identify potential business partners, as well as to promote Chinese investment in Minnesota. Pawlenty also led Minnesota trade delegations to [[Canada]] in 2003 and the [[Czech Republic]] in 2004, and went to [[India]] in October 2007. In December 2008 he led a trade mission trip to [[Israel]]<ref>Smith, Dane. ''[http://www.startribune.com/587/story/969287.html Pawlenty plans trade mission to India]'', [[Star Tribune]], January 30, 2007. Retrieved January 30, 2007.</ref> Pawlenty's first term coincided with the deployment of National Guardsmen from numerous states, connected with the [[War on Terror]] and the wars in Iraq and [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|Afghanistan]]. Pawlenty made trips to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] (2003), [[Kosovo]] (2004) and (2008), [[Poland]], [[Iraq]] and the Czech Republic visiting Minnesota troops.

Pawlenty was visited in 2004 by [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Vicente Fox]] in talks to strengthen trade. Fox announced that his country would open a [[consulate]] in Minnesota the next year, removing the need for Mexican residents in the state to travel to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] for identification papers and other materials.

Early in 2006, after issuing a study that estimated the cost of illegal immigration to the state as approximately $188&nbsp;million, Pawlenty announced a program for changing the way the state dealt with persons who were in the United States illegally. Pawlenty said that the economic benefits of illegal immigration did not justify the illegal behavior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/law/jan-june06/immigration_3-22.html|title=MINNESOTA'S IMMIGRATION DEBATE|publisher=Twin Cities Public Broadcasting|author=Jim Lehrer|date=March 22, 2006}}</ref> In mid-year he sent Minnesota National Guardsmen to the U.S.-Mexico border at the request of the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] and the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]].

===Other activities===
[[Image:MN WWII dedication Pawlenty.JPG|thumb|right|In June 2007, Pawlenty dedicated the state's World War II Veterans Memorial]]
Pawlenty had a weekly one-hour radio show on [[WCCO-AM]], a tradition he inherited from his predecessor as governor, [[Jesse Ventura]]. Pawlenty was the chairman of the [[National Governors Association]] from 2007 to 2008. He also served as Chair of the [[Midwestern Governors Association]] in 2006.

In 1994, Pawlenty's wife Mary was appointed as a judge of the [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]] District Court in [[Hastings, Minnesota]] and the two began raising their two daughters, Anna and Mara. After he was elected in 2002, the family remained at their Eagan home instead of moving into the Governor's Residence because of Mary's requirement to stay in her judicial district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200211/06_hughesa_newgov/|title=Pawlenty sets stage for a Capitol revolution|author=by Art Hughes|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|date=2002-11-06}}</ref> In 2007, she left her judicial position to become General Counsel of the [[National Arbitration Forum]], a dispute resolution company based in Minneapolis.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/01/04/marypawlenty/|title=Mary Pawlenty leaves bench for new job|date=2007-01-04|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Minnesota Public radio}}</ref> She stayed on only briefly before departing for another dispute resolution company, the [http://www.mediationnetworkmn.com Gilbert Mediation Center].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wcco.com/local/mary.pawlenty.first.2.370037.html|title=Minn.

Pawlenty was raised a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. His conversion to an Evangelical Christian faith has been attributed to his wife Mary, who is a member of [[Wooddale Church]] in [[Eden Prairie, Minnesota]],<ref>[http://www.mnhs.org/people/governors/gov/gov_40.htm MNHS Biography]</ref> a member congregation of the Minnesota [[Baptist]] Conference.

I still attend Mass once in a while there. The church I now attend is an interdenominational church which has got many former Catholics in it, and so we share the Christian faith and the Bible. I had to reconcile my faith life with my wife so we could have a consistent, integrated family faith life."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2011/01/06/tim-pawlenty-talks-to-pd-about-michele-bachmann-michael-steele/ |title=Tim Pawlenty on Michele Bachmann, Michael Steele . . . and Hockey |first=Matt |last=Lewis |date=January 2011 |accessdate =May 16, 2011|work=[[Politics Daily]]}}</ref>

In April 2009, 46% of Minnesotans approved of Pawlenty, while 40% disapproved.<ref>http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/surveys/2009_Archives/PPP_Release_MN_416.pdf</ref> In October 2010 a Rasmussen report showed that Pawlenty had a 49% approval rating with 49% disapproving.<ref>[http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/PPP_Release_MN_416.pdf ]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}<!--it appears that this was pointing to the 4/09 one, no the 10/10 one --></ref>
