'''Damon Graham Devereux Hill''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born [[17 September]] [[1960]] in [[London]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] former racing driver from [[England]]. He was the 1996 [[Formula One]] World Champion and is the son of the late double Formula One world champion [[Graham Hill]], and is the only son of a world champion to win the title.

Damon Hill came to professional motorsports relatively late: he began [[Motorcycle sport|racing motorcycles]] in 1983 at the age of 23. The following year he won the 350&nbsp;cc Clubman's cup at [[Brands Hatch]]. In 1985 he moved on to four-wheel single-seater racing with Team [[Van Diemen]] in the [[Formula Ford]] championship, before moving up into the UK [[Formula 3]] championship in 1986. After three seasons in Formula 3, where he won four races, Hill ascended another tier of open wheel racing by joining Mooncraft in the International [[Formula 3000]] championship, where, although often competitive, he never won a race. 

Hill started his Formula One career in 1992 with the then uncompetitive [[Brabham]] team. He took the first of his 22 victories at the [[1993 Hungarian Grand Prix]] for the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] team the following year. In 1994, he won the [[1994 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]], a race his father had never won in his long and successful career. During the mid 1990s, Hill was [[Michael Schumacher]]'s main rival for the Formula One Driver's Championship, finishing runner-up in the German's 1994 and 1995 title seasons. The two had a series of controversial clashes on and off the track, including the collision at the [[1994 Australian Grand Prix]] that gave Schumacher his first title by a single point.

Hill was dropped by Williams in 1997 despite taking eight victories and the world championship in 1996. He went on to record the [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] team's first ever win at the [[1998 Belgian Grand Prix]], and came within a few miles of being the only driver to win a Grand Prix for the [[Arrows]] team and their [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] engine supplier at the [[1997 Hungarian Grand Prix]]. He retired from the sport at the end of the 1999 season, after 122 race starts.

In 2006, Hill became president of the [[British Racing Drivers' Club]], succeeding [[Jackie Stewart]].

==Personal and early life==

Hill was born in [[Hampstead]] on [[17 September]] [[1960]] to double Formula One world champion [[Graham Hill]], who won his first World Championship two years after Damon's birth, and his wife Bette. Hill has two sisters, Samantha and Brigitte. Brigitte was an actress; she starred in her first film (''Caravan to Vaccares'') in 1974, and started Hill Marketing in 1998 after working with Damon. In 2002, she began managing the unrelated American racing driver Derek Hill, son of 1961 Formula One World Champion [[Phil Hill]].<ref>''Family Tree'' [http://www.caspoldermans.com/hill/index2.html TheHillsForever]. Retrieved 23 June 2006</ref>

While in his teens Damon attended the prestigious [[Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School]] in [[Hertfordshire]].<ref>''Hill, Damon Graham Devereux'' [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/ Who's Who 2006 - online version of reference book]. Retrieved 3 July 2006 via KnowUK</ref> The death of his father in a plane crash in 1975 when Damon was only 15&nbsp;years old left the Hill family in drastically changed circumstances; Hill worked as a labourer and a motorcycle courier to support his further education.

Damon is married to Georgie (born [[20 April]] [[1963]]) and they have four children: Oliver (born [[4 May]] [[1989]]), Joshua (born [[9 January]] [[1991]]), Tabitha (born [[16 July]] [[1995]]) and Rosie (born [[1 February]] [[1998]]). Oliver was born with [[Down syndrome|Down's syndrome]] and Damon and Georgie are both active supporters of related charities.<ref>''Family Tree > Oliver Hill'' [http://www.caspoldermans.com/hill/index2.html TheHillsForever].

==Career==
===Pre-Formula One===
Hill started his motorsport career in [[Motorcycle sport|motorcycle racing]] in 1983, winning the 350&nbsp;cc clubman's championship at [[Brands Hatch]],<ref>Murray Walker & Simon Taylor [http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852279184 ''Murray Walker's Formula One Heroes''] Page 136, Line 19 Virgin Books ISBN 1-85227-918-4</ref> before taking a race car course at the Winfield Racing School in [[France]].<ref>Murray Walker & Simon Taylor [http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852279184  ''Murray Walker's Formula One Heroes''] Page 136, Line 31 Virgin Books ISBN 1-85227-918-4</ref> Hill did not make his single-seater debut until 1984, wearing the blue and white colours of the [[London Rowing Club]] on his helmet as his father had done. He slowly graduated through [[Formula Ford]], winning six races for Team [[Van Diemen]] in 1985. Hill then moved up into [[Formula Three]] where he raced for three different teams in three years, with a steady first season for Mooncraft in 1986 and brace of wins in each of the following years for Middlebridge Racing and then Intersport. In 1989 Hill progressed to [[Formula 3000]], racing again for Mooncraft and then Middlebridge Racing over the next three years. Although Hill ran at the front with the unfavoured [[Lola Racing Cars|Lola]] chassis for Middlebridge in 1990 and 1991 - he took three pole positions and led five races in 1990<ref>Damon Hill [http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00115.html www.grandprix.com] Interview by Joe Saward with Damon Hill. Retrieved 27 June 2006.</ref> - he did not win a race during his Formula 3000 career.

===Formula One===
====1992: Brabham====
''Related Article: [[Brabham|Brabham Racing Organisation]]''

Hill was 32, an age by which many drivers have retired from top competition, when he broke into Grand Prix racing with the struggling [[Brabham]] team in [[1992 Formula One season|1992]]. The former championship-winning team was in serious financial difficulties. Hill only started the season after three races, replacing [[Giovanna Amati]] after her sponsorship had failed to materialise.<ref>Giovanna Amati - Biography [http://www.f1rejects.com/drivers/amati/biography.html www.f1rejects.com] Retrieved 3 August 2006</ref> Amati had not been able to get the car through qualifying but Hill matched his team-mate, [[Eric van de Poele]] by qualifying for two mid-season Grands Prix: The [[1992 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]] and the [[1992 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungarian Grand Prix]]. The [[Hungaroring]] would later be the scene of two victories for Hill and he would never again finish out of the points there. Hill was also the test driver for the dominant [[WilliamsF1|Williams]]-[[Renault F1|Renault]] team that year.<ref> F1 Hall of Fame [http://www.formula1.com/archive/halloffame/driver/71.html www.formula1.com] Retrieved 3 August 2006</ref>

'''1993'''

[[Image:Williams Renault FW16 Hill.jpg|thumb|left|Hill's number '0' Williams]]

When [[Nigel Mansell]] left Williams to drive [[IndyCars]] in [[1993 Formula One season|1993]], Hill was promoted to the race team alongside [[Alain Prost]] ahead of more experienced candidate [[Martin Brundle]].<Ref>Derick Allsop [http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0091783119 ''Designs on Victory: On the Grand Prix Trail With Benetton''], Page 25, Line 5 Hutchinson ISBN 0-09-178311-9</ref> In his first full season of Formula One Hill benefited greatly from the vast experience of his veteran French team-mate.<Ref>Derick Allsop [http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0091783119 ''Designs on Victory: On the Grand Prix Trail With Benetton''] Page 188 Hutchinson ISBN 0-09-178311-9</ref> After four retirements in the first half of the season, as well as a tyre failure while leading the [[1993 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]], the Englishman went on to win three successive races in [[1993 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], [[1993 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]] - where he and [[Michael Schumacher]] had a thrilling race - and [[1993 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]]. In doing so he became the first son of a Formula One Grand Prix winner to take victory himself.

Traditionally the reigning driver's world champion carries the number '1' on his car; his team-mate takes the number '2'. As Nigel Mansell, the 1992 champion, was not racing in Formula One in 1993, his Williams team were given numbers '0' and '2'. As the junior partner, Hill took '0', the second man in Formula One history to do so, after [[Jody Scheckter]] in [[1973 Formula One season|1973]].

'''1994'''
[[Image:Hill Senna Belgium1994.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hill drives through the altered [[Eau Rouge corner]] during practice for the [[1994 Belgian Grand Prix]].]]
In [[1994 Formula One season|1994]] the triple world champion [[Ayrton Senna]] joined Hill at Williams. As the reigning champion - this time Prost - was again no longer racing, Hill retained his number '0'. The pre-season betting had been that Senna would coast to the title, <ref>''Formula One History: After Tamburello'' [http://www.f1-grandprix.com/history7.html F1-GrandPrix.com/History]. Retrieved 13 June 2006</ref> but at Imola the Brazilian died after his car went off the road. With the team undergoing investigation from the Italian authorities on manslaughter charges, Hill found himself team leader with only one season<U+2019>s experience in the top flight. Although Hill told BBC Sport in 2004 that he believed Senna simply took the corner too fast for the conditions,<ref>''Hill: Senna was at fault'' [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/3641633.stm news.bbc.co.uk] Retrieved 9 June 2006</ref> it was widely reported at the time that the car's steering column had failed. Under difficult circumstances Hill took an emotional win two races later in Barcelona, much as his father had done 26 years earlier for [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] after the death of [[Jim Clark]]. Schumacher struggled to second with a gearbox fault, having comfortably led the early laps.

Although Schumacher dominated the early part of the season, Hill came back into contention for the title after winning the [[British Grand Prix]], a race in which his late father had never tasted victory.<ref>Murray Walker & Simon Taylor [http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852279184 ''Murray Walker's Formula One Heroes''] Page 138, Line 7-8 Virgin Books ISBN 1-85227-918-4</ref> Schumacher was disqualified from that race and banned for two further races for overtaking during the formation lap and ignoring a black flag. Four more victories for Hill, three of which were in races where Schumacher was banned or disqualified, took the title battle to the final event at Adelaide.

Neither he nor Schumacher finished the race after a controversial collision which gave the title to Schumacher. Hill was catching Schumacher when the [[Germans|German]] driver ran off the track while leading; although it is unknown whether Schumacher did or did not damage his [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]], it a internationally agreed among jounalists that damage was indeed inflicted on the Benetton.<ref>''Schumacher's chequered history'' [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/motorsport/formula_one/5024532.stm news.bbc.co.uk] Line 8. Retrieved 2 October 2006</ref> Hill had just come through the fifth corner of the track when he saw Schumacher returning to the racing line. Coming into the sixth corner Hill moved to the inside to pass the slower moving car and the two collided, breaking the  Williams' front left [[Double wishbone suspension|suspension wishbone]], and forcing Hill's retirement from the race. BBC Formula One commentator [[Murray Walker]], a great fan and friend of Damon, has often maintained that Schumacher did not cause the crash intentionally. [[Patrick Head]] of the Williams team feels differently: After Schumacher's punishment for blocking the circuit during qualifying for the [[2006 Monaco Grand Prix]], he told F1 Racing that in 1994 "Williams were already 100% certain that Michael was guilty of foul play", but didn't protest Schumacher's title because the team was still dealing with the death of Ayrton Senna.<ref>'''Ruthless' Schumi blasted'' [http://motoring.iafrica.com/formulaone/561093.htm Motoring.iafrica.com].

[[Image:Damon Hill 1995.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Damon Hill driving for the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] Formula One team in [[Canadian Grand Prix|Montreal]] in 1995]]

'''1995'''

Coming into the [[1995 Formula One season|1995 season]], Hill was confident of title glory.<ref>''GP Encyclopaedia > Drivers > Damon Hill'' [http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/drv-hildam.html GrandPrix.com]. Retrieved 14 June 2006</ref> The Williams team were reigning constructors champions, having beaten Benetton in 1994, and with young [[David Coulthard]] as team-mate, Hill was undoubtedly the number one driver. The season started badly when he spun off in Brazil due to a mechanical problem, but a couple of wins put him in the championship lead. It was not to last. Schumacher hit top form and successfully defended his title with two races to spare. To make matters worse, Williams lost the constructors championship. Hill made several high profile errors in 1995, most notable in [[1995 British Grand Prix|Britain]] and [[1995 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]], and it was around this time that [[Frank Williams]] began to consider bringing in [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]] for the future. With Hill already under contract for 1996 his place at the team was secure for one more season, but it would prove to be his last at the Grove squad.

'''1996'''

In [[1996 Formula One season|1996]] the Williams car was clearly the quickest in Formula One<ref>''Features > News Feature > Review of Year 1996'' [http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00244.html GrandPrix.com]. Retrieved 14 June 2006</ref> and Hill went on to win the title ahead of team-mate [[Jacques Villeneuve]] (in his first year in Formula One), becoming the first and only son of a Formula One champion to win the championship himself.<ref>Murray Walker & Simon Taylor [http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852279184 ''Murray Walker's Formula One Heroes''] Page 139, Line 10-12 Virgin Books ISBN 1-85227-918-4</ref> Taking eight wins and never qualifying off the front row, Hill enjoyed by far his best season. At Monaco, the legendary circuit where his father had been so dominant, he had been on course for victory before technical difficulties curtailed his race allowing [[Ligier]] driver [[Olivier Panis]] to take his one and only win. Hill's 1996 world championship earned him his second BBC Sports Personality Of The Year Award, making him one of only three people ever to receive the award twice <U+2013> the others being [[Boxing|Boxer]] [[Henry Cooper (boxer)|Henry Cooper]] and fellow Formula One driver Nigel Mansell.<ref>''Did you know?''

Hill was also awarded the [[Segrave Trophy]] by the [[Royal Automobile Club]]. The trophy is awarded to the British national who accomplishes the most outstanding demonstration of the possibilities of transport by land, sea, air, or water.

====1997: Arrows====

''Related Article: [[Arrows]]''

[[Image:Damon Hill 1997 Arrows.jpg|thumb|right|250px|At the [[1997 British Grand Prix|British GP]], Hill scored his first point for the Arrows team]]
As world champion Hill was in high demand, and had offers to drive from both [[McLaren]] and [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]. However, in Hill's opinion neither fully valued his World Champion status.<ref>''Motor Sport'' January 2007, p.42.</ref> Instead, he surprisingly signed to [[Arrows]], a team which had never won a race in its 20 year history and had scored only a single point the previous year. His title defence in [[1997 Formula One season|1997]] proved unsuccessful, getting off to a poor start when he only narrowly managed to qualify for the [[1997 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]], and then retired on the parade lap. The Arrows car, using tyres from series debutant [[Bridgestone]] and engines from unfancied Yamaha, was generally uncompetitive, and Hill did not score his first point for the team until the [[1997 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]] at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] in July. The highlight of the year came at the [[1997 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungarian Grand Prix]]. On a day when the Bridgestone tyres had a competitive edge over their [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] rivals, Hill qualified third in a car which hadn't previously placed higher than 9th on the grid. During the race he managed to pass championship contender and old rival Michael Schumacher on the track and was leading, well ahead of the eventual 1997 World Champion Villeneuve, late in the race when a hydraulic problem slowed the  Arrows drastically.<ref>''Race Summaries: 1997'' [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/formula_1/62492.stm#hungary News.bbc.co.uk] BBC's review of the 1997 Formula One Season. Retrieved 12 June 2006</ref> This allowed Villeneuve to storm past and win, although Hill still salvaged a brilliant second place and the team's first podium since the [[1995 Australian Grand Prix]].

====1998<U+2013>1999: Jordan====
''Related Article: [[Jordan Grand Prix]]''

'''1998'''
Despite the result in [[1997 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], it was clear that Arrows could not provide Hill with the kind of success that he was used to. For [[1998 Formula One season|1998]] he switched to [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] to partner [[Ralf Schumacher]]. The first half of the season was disastrous, with the car off the pace and unreliable.<ref>Jon Nicholson & Maurice Hamilton (1999) [http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0333736559 Against the Odds: Jordan's drive to win''] p.89-90 & p.107-108 Macmillan Publishing ISBN 0-333-73655-9</ref> In [[1998 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]] however, things began to improve. Hill benefited from others' misfortunes to lead the race and enjoyed a high speed duel with arch rival [[Michael Schumacher]]. He did not finish in Montreal, but had shown his speed once more.<ref>Jon Nicholson & Maurice Hamilton (1999) [http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0333736559 Against the Odds: Jordan's drive to win''] p.115-116. Macmillan Publishing ISBN 0-333-73655-9</ref> Finally at [[1998 German Grand Prix|Hockenheim]] he scored his first point of 1998. At [[1998 Belgian Grand Prix|Spa]] he took Jordan's first ever win, leading home his team-mate for a 1-2 in soaking conditions, in an incredibly dramatic race which only eight drivers finished. It was his first victory since being dropped by [[WilliamsF1|Williams]]. He went on to finish the year very strongly with a last lap move on Frentzen at [[1998 Japanese Grand Prix|Suzuka]] which earned him 4th place in the race, and Jordan 4th in the constructors championship.

'''1999'''
Hopes were high for [[1999 Formula One season|1999]], but Hill did not enjoy a good season. Struggling with the new four-grooved tyres introduced that year, he was outpaced by his new team-mate - none other than his replacement at Williams, Heinz-Harald Frentzen - and appeared to lose motivation. After an inglorious crash at [[1999 Canadian Grand Prix|Montreal]] he announced plans to retire at the end of the year, but after a miserable [[1999 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]] he considered quitting immediately. Jordan persuaded him to stay on for [[1999 British Grand Prix|Silverstone]] at least, but going into the weekend Hill was talking of stopping after the race. Jordan had tested [[Jos Verstappen]] as a contingency for Hill retiring mid-season, but following a strong fifth place at his home event, the 1996 champion opted to see out the year. Only two more points were added that year, with a sixth place at Spa, scene of his last win, representing his final point in Formula One. To make matters worse, his performance was in stark contrast to that of team-mate Frentzen, who eventually finished third in the championship and was in the running to win the title going into the final few races. With three races of 1999 to go, there were rumours that [[Prost Grand Prix|Prost]] would release [[Jarno Trulli]], who had signed for Jordan for [[2000 Formula One season|2000]], early to replace Hill, but the Briton completed the season. At [[1999 Japanese Grand Prix|Suzuka]] his last race in Formula One ended when he spun off the track and pulled into the pits to retire a healthy car, much to the dismay of the team.

====Notable battles with Michael Schumacher====
Hill and Michael Schumacher clashed frequently on the track in the mid 1990s:
*'''[[1994 Belgian Grand Prix|Spa 1994]]''': The two made contact at the Les Combes corner. On this occasion Schumacher received a one-race suspended ban.
*'''[[1994 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan 1994]]''': Schumacher led the early stages of the rain-soaked event only for the race to be stopped after [[Martin Brundle|Brundle's]] [[McLaren]] crashed. Hill took over the lead at the re-start and pushed very hard to beat Schumacher, the acknowledged <U+2018>rain master<U+2019>, in the wet and take the title fight to the final race of the season in Australia.
*'''[[1994 Australian Grand Prix|Adelaide 1994]]''': Schumacher went off the track while leading the last race of the season. He returned to the track at reduced speed where Hill tried to pass him at the next corner. The two collided and both retired. The world title went to Schumacher by a single point.
<!-- This is intended as a two line summary - if you wish to expand on the incident, please edit the 1994 season words about 6 sections further up the page. However, bear in mind the requirement for a neutral and factual approach, the existing words have been worked on quite carefully. Thanks. -->
*'''[[1995 British Grand Prix|Silverstone 1995]]''': At his home grand prix and trailing Schumacher by 11&nbsp;points in the championship, Hill attempted to pass the German going into Priory 11&nbsp;laps from the end of the race. The two collided again and both retired. Hill described it as a "racing incident" while Schumacher compared it to Adelaide 1994.
*'''[[1995 Italian Grand Prix|Monza 1995]]''': On lap 24 Hill and Schumacher collided when trying to lap [[Taki Inoue]]. Neither accepted blame. Hill questioned why Schumacher was "suddenly doing nought miles an hour", while a majority of Schumacher fans described it as a "stupid move" by Hill. Hill received a suspended one-race ban, which was never put into effect.
*'''[[1995 European Grand Prix|Nurburgring 1995]]''': On lap 18 Hill attempted to overtake Schumacher but the German blocked and squeezed him to the edge of the track. Hill locked up and hit the back of the Benetton.
*'''[[1997 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary 1997]]''': After qualifying third in the usually uncompetitive [[Arrows]], Hill passed Schumacher cleanly on the inside on lap 11 going into the first corner before pulling away into the lead of the race.
*'''[[1998 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada 1998]]''': Schumacher accused Hill of "dangerously weaving" while they were dicing for second. Hill responded by saying that Schumacher's comments were "rich" coming from someone who forced Heinz-Harald Frentzen off in the track in the very same race.<ref>''

The device and colours represent the [[London Rowing Club]] of which Graham and Bette Hill were both successful members and where they first met. Although Hill is not a rower himself, he has said that he is proud to wear his father's colours and the club are happy for him to keep up the tradition.<ref>''Damon Hill's Statistics, Helmet'' [http://www.caspoldermans.com/hill/index2.html TheHillsForever].

==Later life==

In retirement, Hill founded the high-performance car leasing business [[P1 International]], based in Surrey, [[England]], and became involved in a [[BMW]] dealership that bears his name. He has contributed many articles to the world's best-selling grand prix magazine, [[F1 Racing]]. Hill has raced both cars and motorcycles at the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]]<ref>[http://specials.ft.com/goodwood2001/FT3A05Z1LPC.html] Article on the 2001 Goodwood Festival of Speed</ref> and in 2005 he tested the new [[GP2 Series|GP2]] car, lapping impressively from the off.

Hill also did a famous television advert with [[Murray Walker]] for [[Pizza Hut]] in the UK, in which Walker commentated on Hill's meal as if it was a race. Parodying Hill's 1994 and 1995 seasons, the advert sees Walker jokingly report that "...

Final Paragraph. Retrieved 10 June 2006</ref>

As well as his [[Top Gear]] appearance, Hill appeared in a number of other TV shows, appearing in an episode of [[This is Your Life]] and before taking part in the [[1998 French Grand Prix]], Hill appeared as a guest on [[TFI Friday]]. Hill later appeared on other shows, such as [[Shooting Stars]]; [[Late Show with David Letterman]]; ''Clive Anderson All Talk'' and appeared as a guest star on the first episode of [[Bang Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer]].<ref>''Damon Hill > Credits'' [http://www.tv.com/damon-hill/person/72476/appearances.html TV.com]. Retrieved 6 October 2006</ref> When [[Jason Statham]] required stunt driving lessons for his role as Handsome Rob in the 2003 remake of [[The Italian Job]], he asked Hill to help him out.

In April 2006, Hill succeeded [[Jackie Stewart]] as President of the BRDC ([[British Racing Drivers Club]]). The BRDC, owner of the [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone circuit]], is at a crucial stage as it seeks to steer the future of the track and its facilities while facing increased competition from newer international facilities domestically and abroad.<ref>''Stewart set to hand over to Hill'' [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4872104.stm news.bbc.co.uk] Hill's nomination to BRDC president news item.

Hill was back behind wheel of a single-seater race car in the summer of 2006, when he took a 600bhp [[Grand Prix Masters]] machine for a test run around [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]. In an interview with [[ITV F1]], Hill said that he enjoyed the experience and that he might consider racing in the GP Masters in the future. He was also asked in the interview to give his opinion on [[Jenson Button]]'s maiden Grand Prix victory in  [[2006 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], saying that he thought Jenson was "good" and that he was "a very fast driver." He was also asked in the interview about the battle between his old rival, [[Michael Schumacher]] and [[Fernando Alonso]], Hill said that he was "just as fascinated as anyone to see what<U+2019>s going to happen".<ref>''Damon Hill Exclusive'' [http://www.itv-f1.com/Feature.aspx?Type=General&PO_ID=37021 ITV-F1.com].

====Music career====
Damon Hill formed the [[punk rock|punk]] band "Sex, Hitler and the Hormones" with some friends while at school. Hill once joked in an interview that at that time they didn't go on tour because they didn't have [[moped]]s. Hill continued to be interested in music and after achieving success in Formula One became friends with ex-[[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[George Harrison]], with whom he played several times. Hill also recorded with rock band [[Def Leppard]] after meeting their lead singer [[Joe Elliott]] at a party. He played on the opening track of the album ''[[Euphoria (Def Leppard album)|Euphoria]]'', "Demolition Man", including a 10-second guitar solo. Elliott described Damon's style as "a cross between the way Slash plays and [[Andy McCoy]] from [[Hanoi Rocks]]".

During his racing career Hill often played in front of a crowd of Formula One fans at the [[British Grand Prix]] at Silverstone. In 1995 he was joined by fellow Formula One racer [[Johnny Herbert]]. In 1999 Hill's team boss at the time, [[Eddie Jordan]], starred on [[drums]] while he played for his fans for the very last time at Silverstone. Hill has also played with the S.A.S. band, which has many guest performances, and with [[Pat Cash]]'s Wild Colonial Boys.<ref>[[The Guardian]], January 14 2006, p.8</ref>

Hill's most recent band was The Conrods which was active up to 2003. The band was formed after his retirement from racing at the end of the 1999 season and played cover versions of well known songs from [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Beatles|Beatles]] and [[The Kinks|Kinks]]. Band members were Damon Hill (guitar), Josh Phillips (keyboards; [[Midge Ure]] & [[Whitesnake]]), Mark Brzezicki (drums; [[Big Country]]), Steve Brzezicki (bass; [[Scatman John]]), Robert Hart (vocals; [[Bad Company]]) and Steve Roux (guitar/vocals). The band performed at Grands Prix, Formula One social events and in various smaller venues as well as on several TV programmes.<ref>''Special, Damon Hill'' [http://www.caspoldermans.com/hill/index2.html TheHillsForever]. Retrieved 10 June 2006</ref> Since becoming president of the BRDC Hill claims to have abandoned the guitar - being "too busy doing school runs and looking after pets."<ref>[[The Independent]], July 24 2006, p.14</ref>
