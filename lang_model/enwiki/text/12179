'''John Mark Colquhoun''' (born [[14 July]] [[1963]]) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] footballer who played for [[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]], [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[St. Johnstone F.C.|St. Johnstone]].

==Playing history==
A slightly-built but very pacy [[striker]], Colquhoun was a popular and prolific goalscorer for his hometown club [[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion]] when he was snapped up by [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in 1983. A relatively unsatisfying period at [[Celtic Park]] followed, in which he was played mostly on the wing instead of in the central striker's role at which he had excelled and which had brought him to the attention of the major Scottish clubs.

Nevertheless, Colquhoun did enough at Celtic to earn a move to [[Edinburgh]] with [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] in 1985, and in a six-year stint, helped the club achieve its best performances in many years, only losing the [[1985-86 in Scottish football|1985-86]] Scottish [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Premier Division]] on goal difference thanks to a last-day defeat at [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]]. It was during this spell that he gained international recognition, earning 2 [[caps (football)|caps]] for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] and [[Malta national football team|Malta]] in 1988.

In [[1991]], Colquhoun signed for [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], staying for only a single season before signing for [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. After a further season on [[Wearside]], John returned to the top division in Scotland when he re-signed for Hearts. In a four-year second tenure at [[Tynecastle Stadium|Tynecastle]], he never quite scaled the heights of 1986 in the league, although he did score with a low drive in the [[1995-96 in Scottish football|1995-96]] [[Scottish Cup]] Final. Unfortunately, his side lost 5-1 to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] that day.

Colquhoun spent a month with Scottish First Division side [[St. Johnstone F.C.|St. Johnstone]] in 1997 after leaving Hearts, and then retired at the end of that season, having played in over 450 league games and scored well over 100 league goals.

John is a regular guest on [[STV]]'s ''[[Scotsport]]'' on Monday nights.
 

==Outside football==
A keen student of politics, Colquhoun was active during his playing career in the players' union in Scotland. After retiring, he was elected [[Rector of the University of Edinburgh]] and served as a member of [[sportscotland]], the sports [[funding body]] for Scotland. He is now a successful football agent running his own agency.
