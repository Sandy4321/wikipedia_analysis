'''Claig Castle''' was a stronghold of the [[Clan Donald]] or '''MacDonald''' in the north of [[Scotland]]. 

===History===

The castle was once a massive fort described as a ''sea fortress'' and allowed the Macdonald [[Lord of the Isles]] to dominate and control the sea traffic north and south through the [[Hebrides]] for more than four centuries. The castle is located on the Isles of [[Fraoch Eilean]] which is just off the Isle of [[Jura, Scotland]].

The castle remained a stronghold of the MacDonalds until they were subdued in the 17th century by the [[Clan Campbell]].
