'''Palmyra''' {{IPAc-en|<U+02CC>|p|<U+00E6>|l|<U+02C8>|m|a<U+026A>r|<U+0259>}}, ({{lang-arc|<U+072C><U+0715><U+0721><U+0718><U+072A><U+072C><U+0710>}}; {{lang-ar|<U+062A><U+062F><U+0645><U+0631>}}; {{lang-he|<U+05EA><U+05B7><U+05BC><U+05D3><U+05B0><U+05DE><U+05D5><U+05B9><U+05E8>}}; {{lang-grc|<U+03A0><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03BC><U+03CD><U+03C1><U+03B1>}}), was an ancient [[Semitic people|Semitic]] city, located in [[Homs Governorate]], [[Syria]]. Dating back to the [[Neolithic]], Palmyra was first attested in the early second millennium BC, as a caravan stop for travelers crossing the [[Syrian Desert]]. The city is mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and in the annals of the [[List of Assyrian kings|Assyrian kings]], then it was incorporated into the [[Seleucid Empire]], followed by the [[Roman Empire]] which brought great prosperity.

Palmyra's wealth allowed the construction of many monumental projects. By the third century, Palmyra was turned into a prosperous metropolis, with a strong army capable of defeating the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid empire]] in 260. Following the victory, Palmyra's chief [[Odaenathus]] was proclaimed king but was assassinated in 267. He was succeeded by his minor son, under the regency of queen [[Zenobia]], who started invading the Roman eastern provinces in 269. The rebellion was masked by a nominal subordination to Rome. However, the situation escalated and the Palmyrene rulers adopted the imperial titles in 271. Roman emperor Aurelian defeated Palmyra in 272, and destroyed it in 273 after a failed second rebellion. Palmyra became a minor city under the rule of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashiduns]], [[Ummayads]], [[Abbassids]], [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]], and their vassals. After being destroyed by the [[Timurids]] in 1400, Palmyra remained a small village under the rule of the [[Ottomans]] until 1918, then the [[Arab Kingdom of Syria|Syrian kingdom]], followed by the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French mandate]]. In 1929 the French started evacuating the villagers into the newly built village of [[Tadmur]]. The evacuation was completed in 1932 and the site became abandoned and available for excavations.

The Palmyrenes were mainly a mix of [[Amorites]], [[Arameans]] and [[Arabs]],<ref name="arab palm">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=41-MAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA280#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Ancient Syria: A Three Thousand Year History|author=Trevor Bryce|page= 280|year= 2014}}</ref> in addition to a [[Jews|Jewish]] minority. The society was tribal and the inhabitants spoke their own [[Palmyrene dialect|dialect]] of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], in addition to [[Greek language|Greek]]. Both of the languages were replaced by [[Arabic language|Arabic]] following the Arab conquest in 634. Palmyra's [[Culture of Syria|local]] culture was influenced by the [[Greco-Roman_world#Greco-Roman_Culture|Greco-Roman]] and [[Culture of Iran|Persian]] cultures, which produced a distinctive art and architecture. The city's inhabitants worshiped [[Canaanite religion|local deities]], in addition to [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian]] and [[Arabian mythology|Arab]] gods. They later converted to [[Christianity]] in the fourth century, followed by [[Islam]] in the second half of the first millennium.

The Palmyrene political organization was based on the Greek city-state model. It was governed by a senate responsible for both the public works and the military. After gaining the status of a [[Colonia (Roman)|Colonia]] in the third century, Palmyra's incorporated Roman institutions to its system before adopting a monarchical system in 260. Palmyra gained its wealth from caravan trade. The Palmyrenes were renowned merchants who established colonies along the [[Silk Road]], and conducted their operations all around the Roman empire.

[[Michael Patrick O'Connor]] argued for a [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] origin of both ''Palmyra'' and ''Tadmor'',<ref name="yoel" /> citing the incapability of explaining the alterations to the theorized roots of both names, which are represented in the adding of a ''-d-'' to ''Tamar'' and a ''-ra-'' to ''palame''.<ref name="yoel2" /> According to this theory, '' Tadmor'' is derived from the Hurrian word ''Tad'', meaning ''to love'', + a [[mid vowel]] rising (mVr) [[formant]] ''Mar''.

===Excavations===
[[File:Tetrapylon Palmyra.jpg|thumb|The Tetrapylon.]]
During the [[Middle Ages]], the city was largely forgotten in the [[Western world|West]].<ref name="babseeasad" /> It was sporadically visited by travelers such as [[Pietro Della Valle]] (between 1616-1625), [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]] (in 1638), in addition to many [[Swedes|Swedish]] and [[Germans|German]] explorers.<ref name="archol">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=8kLFfE1qPhIC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= Palmyra and Its Empire: Zenobia's Revolt Against Rome|author=Richard Stoneman|page= 7|year= 1994}}</ref> In 1678, a group of [[English people|English]] merchants visited the city, while the first scholarly description of it appeared in a book by [[Abednego Seller]] (1705).<ref name="archol" /> In 1751, an expedition led by [[Robert Wood (antiquarian)|Robert Wood]] and [[James Dawkins (antiquarian)|James Dawkins]] studied the architecture of the city,<ref name="archol" /> and visits by different travelers and antiquarians continued, including one by [[Lady Hester Stanhope]] in 1813.<ref name="archol" />

The first excavations were conducted in 1902 by [[Otto Puchstein]], followed in 1917 by [[Theodor Wiegand]].<ref name="archo5l" /> In 1929, the French general director of antiquities of Syria and Lebanon [[Henri Arnold Seyrig]], started a wide scale excavation in the site,<ref name="archo5l" /> which was halted by the [[WW2]], but resumed soon after its end.<ref name="archo5l" /> Between 1954 and 1956, the temple of Baalshamin was excavated by a Swiss expedition organized by the [[UNESCO]].<ref name="archo5l" /> Since 1958, the site was excavated by the [[Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities]],<ref name="faho98765" /> in addition to Polish expeditions led by [[Kazimierz Micha<U+0142>owski]] (until 1980) and [[Michael Gawlikowski]] (until 1984).<ref name="archo5l" />

In November 2010, [[Austrians|Austrian]] media manager Helmut Thoma admitted to looting a Palmyrene grave in 1980, where he had stolen architectural pieces, today presented in his private living room.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.welt.de/fernsehen/article10768775/Es-war-Nacht-und-da-waren-Schlangen.html?wtmc=plista||title= Ex-RTL-Chef Thoma "Es war Nacht, und da waren Schlangen ..."|language= de|publisher= Die Wilt |date= 6 November 2010 |accessdate= 8 February 2015}}</ref> German and Austrian archaeologists protested against this crime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spektrum.de/news/ein-schlag-ins-gesicht/1054329|title= Ein Schlag ins Gesicht|language= de|publisher= Spektrum der Wissenschaft |date= 15 November 2010 |accessdate= 8 February 2015}}</ref>

===Current situation===
As a result of the [[Syrian Civil War]], the site was subjected to wide scale looting and damaged by the clashes between the combatants.<ref name="looting269">{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/03/us-syria-crisis-palmyra-idUSBRE9320HL20130403 |title= Syria's ancient oasis city of Palmyra threatened in fighting |publisher= Reuters |date=3 April 2013 |accessdate=8 February 2015}}</ref> In the summer of 2012, there was an increasing concern of looting of the museum and the site, when an amateur video was posted, showing Syrian soldiers carrying funerary stones.<ref name="looting88">{{cite web |url=http://observers.france24.com/fr/content/20120730-video-hommes-uniforme-pieces-archeologiques-craintes-pillage-palmyre-syrie-soldat-patrimoine|title= Une vid<U+00E9>o amateur ravive les craintes de pillage sur les sites arch<U+00E9>ologiques de Syrie|language= fr|publisher= France 24|date= 30 July 2012 |accessdate= 8 February 2015}}</ref> However, according to [[France 24]]'s report; "from the information gathered, it is impossible to determine whether pillaging was taking place."<ref name=looting88/> In 2013, Bel's temple facade had a large circle caused by a mortar bomb, and the columns of colonnade have been damaged by [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]].<ref name=looting269/> According to Maamoun Abdulkarim, the director of antiquities and museums at the [[Ministry of Culture (Syria)|Syrian Ministry of Culture]], the [[Syrian Army]] positioned its troops in some of the archaeological site's areas,<ref name=looting269/> while the [[Syrian opposition]] soldiers are stationed in the gardens around the city.<ref name=looting269/>

In May 2015, it was reported that militants from the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] were advancing on the site, raising fears that it would be destroyed in the same style of [[Nimrud]].<ref name=Tharoor>{{cite news|last1=Tharoor|first1=Ishaan|title=Islamic State fighters are at the gates of an ancient Roman-era city in Syria|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/05/14/islamic-state-fighters-are-at-the-gates-of-an-ancient-roman-era-city-in-syria/?postshare=3891431640485318|accessdate=14 May 2015|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|date=14 May 2015}}</ref>
