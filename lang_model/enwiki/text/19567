'''Southgate''' is one of the 13 residential neighbourhoods in [[Crawley]], a town and [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] in [[West Sussex]], England.  Crawley was planned and laid out as a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] after the Second World War, based on the principle of self-contained neighbourhoods surrounding a town centre of civic and commercial buildings.  Southgate was one of the four in the "inner ring" closest to the town centre, and was intended to be the largest of the nine designed in the original master plan.<ref name="VCH18415">{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18415|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 3 <U+2013> Bramber Rape (North-Eastern Part) including Crawley New Town.

The area was settled by pre-Roman people, and industrial and other artefacts from that era were found during construction of the neighbourhood.  In the 19th century, after Crawley was connected to the national railway network, housing developed south of the line around the [[A23 road|Brighton Road]], which divides the modern neighbourhood in two.  New Town-era expansion produced a large residential area with a high proportion of [[terraced house]]s and a range of [[Schools in Crawley, West Sussex|schools]], [[List of places of worship in Crawley|places of worship]] and community facilities; but some historic buildings and areas of open space remain, including an award-winning park.  The population at the time of the [[2001 United Kingdom Census]] was 8,016.

==History==
In the century before the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Romans arrived in Britain]], the area now covered by West Sussex was ruled by the [[Atrebates]], a [[Belgae|Belgic]] tribe led by [[Commius]].  They were found to have been present in the area now covered by Southgate when building work took place in 1969.  The Southgate West development was underway on land covered by Hogs Hill Farm, which occupied a ridge of land between the Horsham and Brighton Roads.  Land clearance revealed two ditches filled with debris such as bones and pieces of pottery.<ref name="Gwynne12">{{Harvnb|Gwynne|1990|p=12.}}</ref>  The next year, a large house on Horsham Road was demolished to make way for a new road of houses; the builders discovered similar pits, and the remains were identified as pre-Roman using [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dating]] techniques.  The remains of [[crucible]]s, [[slag]] and other ironworking materials were also discovered; these were confirmed as being from the same era, the [[1st century BC|1st]] and [[2nd century BC|2nd centuries BC]].<ref name="Gwynne13">{{Harvnb|Gwynne|1990|p=13.}}</ref>  It was later confirmed that the Hogs Hill Farm remains dated from the Roman era, meaning that the ironmaking and pottery-producing activities of the Atrebates were continued by their conquerors.<ref name="Gwynne13"/>  By the time the excavations and investigation finished, evidence of three iron [[Bloomery|bloomeries]], a small [[flint]] mine, roof tiles (possibly from a building on the site) and many pieces of pottery had been found and catalogued.<ref name="Gwynne10">{{Harvnb|Gwynne|1990|p=10.}}</ref><ref name="Gwynne14">{{Harvnb|Gwynne|1990|p=14.}}</ref>

These discoveries confirmed for the first time the existence of [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]], pre-Roman ironmaking and industrial development in the area of northern Sussex now occupied by Crawley.<ref name="Gwynne12"/>  Despite this, investigation and analysis were initially discouraged.

Crawley began to develop slowly from the 13th century, when it was granted a royal charter for a market.<ref name="Goepel4"/>  Its ecclesiastical parish, centred on [[St John the Baptist's Church, Crawley|St John the Baptist's Church]], was tiny in comparison to neighbouring [[Worth, West Sussex|Worth]] and [[Ifield, West Sussex|Ifield]].<ref name="Goepel3">{{Harvnb|Goepel|1980|p=3.}}</ref>  The parish had an unusual shape: very narrow, long from north to south, and gradually widening to the north until it met the county boundary with [[Surrey]].<ref name="Gwynne42">{{Harvnb|Gwynne|1990|p=42.}}</ref>  This directed development northwards along the High Street, part of the ancient London to Brighton road which had provided the impetus for development to begin.<ref name="VCH18405">{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18405|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 3 <U+2013> Bramber Rape (North-Eastern Part) including Crawley New Town.

By this time the distinction between the name "London Road" (the section north of the church) and "Brighton Road" (southwards) had been made;<ref name="VCH18405"/><ref name="Gwynne98">{{Harvnb|Gwynne|1990|p=98.}}</ref> and [[Toll house|tollgates]] were built north and south of the town: these became known as the North Gate and South Gate.<ref name="VCH18405"/>

Crawley was connected to the railway network in 1848 when [[Arun Valley Line|a line]] was built from Three Bridges to Horsham.<ref name="Goepel7">{{Harvnb|Goepel|1980|p=7.}}</ref>  It crossed the High Street at a [[level crossing]] at the south end of the built-up area.<ref name="VCH18405"/>  The provision of fast, regular trains to London and other destinations stimulated residential and commercial development, especially around the station.<ref name="Goepel7"/>  South of the line, around the Brighton Road, there was plenty of land for building; in the second half of the 19th century, two building firms<U+2014>the most important in Crawley's pre-New Town history<U+2014>exploited it by building two areas of housing which still exist today, forming the northernmost part of the Southgate neighbourhood.<ref name="Bastable14">{{Harvnb|Bastable|1986|loc=<U+00A7>14.}}</ref><ref name="Bastable18">{{Harvnb|Bastable|1986|loc=<U+00A7>18.}}</ref>  Richard Cook set up a building firm next to the railway line soon after its completion; in the early 1870s he built some streets of mainly [[terraced house]]s west of Brighton Road.

Apart from these residential buildings, farms and their associated land, there was little else in the area now known as Southgate until the Development Corporation started building the neighbourhood in the 1950s.

===New Town era===
[[File:Southgate Drive, Southgate, Crawley.jpg|thumb|right|Looking east along Southgate Drive]]
Crawley was designated as a New Town in January 1947 after the [[New Towns Act 1946]] identified it as a suitable site for one.<ref name="Gazette">{{LondonGazette|issue=37849|startpage=231|date=10 January 1947|accessdate=1 March 2009}}</ref><ref name="SuppMem">{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmtlgr/603/603ap23.htm|title=Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions: Appendices to the Minutes of Evidence. Supplementary memorandum by Crawley Borough Council (NT 15(a))|accessdate=1 March 2009|publisher=The Information Policy Division, Office of Public Sector Information|year=2002|work=United Kingdom Parliament Publications and Records website}}</ref>  A Development Corporation was formed, led by the architect [[Thomas Bennett (architect)|Thomas Bennett]], and [[Urban planning|planner]] Anthony Minoprio provided a master plan for the town's development.<ref name="VCH18414"/>  He proposed a double ring of nine neighbourhoods surrounding an extended town centre. Southgate was to form the southern part of the inner ring, between the town centre and the southern section of the planned Crawley [[ring road]] (which already existed, formed by Crawley and Southgate Avenues).  Its built-up area, excluding Goffs Park<U+2014>which would lie within the neighbourhood's northwest corner<U+2014>was to be {{convert|138|ha|acre}}.<ref name="VCH18415"/>

The development was intended to take place in two stages: Southgate East, east of the Brighton Road, was to have been built in the early 1950s, and land west of Brighton Road (Southgate West) was to be reserved for expansion of the neighbourhood in the early 1960s.<ref name="VCH18415"/>  Both stages were delayed: the Development Corporation did not finalise their plan for Southgate East until 1954, several years after building should have started.  Work was eventually carried out between 1955 and 1957,<ref name="VCH18415"/> making Southgate the seventh neighbourhood to be started.<ref name="Baseline14">{{cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/report/int163920.pdf|format=PDF|title=Crawley Baseline Character Assessment|year=2009|month=May|publisher=EDAW/[[AECOM]]|page=14|accessdate=9 March 2010}}</ref>

Southgate West suffered even longer delays, partly because of problems with the planned construction processes.<ref name="VCH18415"/>  Work should have started in 1961 but had to wait until 1968; plans were not submitted until 1966.  The archaeological discoveries in 1969 and 1970 caused further delays, and Southgate West was not complete until 1972.<ref name="VCH18415"/>

The master plan proposed that a neighbourhood centre, consisting of community centre, public house, school, church and shopping parade, should be an integral part of each neighbourhood.  Initially the Development Corporation provided temporary community centre buildings; West Sussex County Council provided a permanent facility in 1974.<ref name="VCH18417">{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18417|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 3 <U+2013> Bramber Rape (North-Eastern Part) including Crawley New Town.

==Location within Crawley==
[[File:Crawley Colour-Coded Neighbourhood Street Sign - Southgate.JPG|thumb|right|Southgate street sign]]
Southgate is south of the [[Northgate, West Sussex|Northgate]] neighbourhood (which includes Crawley town centre) and [[West Green, West Sussex|West Green]]; the [[Arun Valley Line|Arun Valley railway line]] forms the boundary.  [[Gossops Green]] lies to the west, [[Broadfield, West Sussex|Broadfield]] is to the southwest, [[Tilgate]] is to the south and [[Furnace Green]] shares a small border to the east.

==Governance==
[[File:Crawley Neighbourhoods (Southgate).png|thumb|right|The Crawley Borough area, showing the 13 neighbourhoods; Southgate is shown in brown]]
When Crawley Urban District was formed in May 1956,<ref name="Gwynne165">{{Harvnb|Gwynne|1986|p=165.}}</ref> it was divided into eight [[Wards of the United Kingdom|ward]]s whose boundaries were identical with those of eight of the extant and planned neighbourhoods.  By 1983, nine years after the district became a [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]], the town had thirteen wards.<ref name="VCH18419">{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18419|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 3 <U+2013> Bramber Rape (North-Eastern Part) including Crawley New Town.

==Demography==
The neighbourhood is coterminous with the administrative [[Wards of the United Kingdom|ward]] of the same name, which is one of the fifteen wards in Crawley.  These divisions are used for collecting [[Census in the United Kingdom|census]] and other statistical and demographic data.  Southgate's population of 8,106 at the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 United Kingdom Census]] made it Crawley's fifth most populous neighbourhood.  Based on its {{convert|181|ha|acre|adj=on}} area, its population density was {{convert|44.75|PD/ha|PD/acre}}<U+2014>more than twice as high as the {{convert|22.18|PD/ha|PD/acre}} density for Crawley overall.<ref name="SG-UV02"/>

At the census date there were 3,421 households, of which 2,317 (68%) were owned by the occupier, 756 (22%) were [[Council house|rented from Crawley Borough Council]] or another public-sector landlord, 274 (8%) were rented privately and 74 (2%) were occupied rent-free.<ref name="SG-UV63">{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=6101987&c=Southgate&d=14&e=16&g=496141&i=1001x1003x1004&o=1&m=0&r=1&s=1235737998832&enc=1&dsFamilyId=163|title=Tenure <U+2013> Households (UV63)|date=18 November 2004|work=Neighbourhood Statistics website: 2001 United Kingdom Census data for Southgate (Ward)|publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS)|accessdate=27 February 2009}}</ref>  These proportions are almost identical to the [[housing tenure]] mix of Crawley as a whole.<ref name="SG-UV63"/>  The relatively high population density is partly explained by the relatively high proportion of residents who live in purpose-built [[Apartment|flats]] or [[maisonette]]s of various types: 16% compared to the Crawley figure of 11%.

[[File:Arora International Hotel, Southgate, Crawley.JPG|thumb|right|Arora International Hotel]]
Modern Southgate is primarily residential, and the area was mostly undeveloped before the New Town was created.  Nevertheless, some commercial and industrial development existed around the Brighton Road and railway line, and farming provided employment.  Two sets of local shops serve the modern neighbourhood, but its proximity to Crawley town centre and main transport routes mean that, as intended in Anthony Minoprio's masterplan, residents travel outside Southgate for most of their employment and shopping requirements.<ref name="Masterplan32">{{Cite report|title=A Master Plan for Crawley New Town|last=Minoprio|first=Anthony|year=1949|month=June|publisher=New Towns Committee|location=London|page=32}}</ref>

In common with other areas around Crawley, the land to the south was held by several large farms.  Malthouse Farm had its own small-scale brickworks as well;<ref name="Gwynne5">{{Harvnb|Gwynne|1986|p=5.}}</ref> Hilltop Farm was at the highest point in the area, {{convert|315|ft|m}} above sea level;<ref name="Masterplan32"/> and Hogs Hill Farm, named after the herds of pigs farmed there,<ref name="Gwynne20">{{Harvnb|Gwynne|1986|p=20.}}</ref> stood on a ridge east of the Brighton Road.<ref name="Gwynne12"/>

Crawley's two main building firms had their yards and works in the Victorian streets near the railway line.  Richard Cook's firm, which built the houses and streets of the 19th-century "New Town" development, was founded in 1861<ref name="Gwynne128">{{Harvnb|Gwynne|1986|p=128.}}</ref> and was based at the corner of two of the new streets.<ref name="Bastable13"/>  The works included a brickyard; poor drainage led to soil and dirty water from it polluted the surrounding area.  The Crawley and Ifield Vigilance Committee, an amateur pressure group, demanded improvements for several years, and proper drains were eventually laid.<ref name="Gwynne127">{{Harvnb|Gwynne|1986|p=127.}}</ref>  Cook and Sons' advertisements revealed the range of products manufactured: the works made bricks, tiles, pipes and pottery, and his team of labourers carried out all types of building and contracting work.<ref name="Gwynne5"/>  James Longley and Sons became the most famous business in Crawley<ref name="Goldsmith19">{{Harvnb|Goldsmith|1990|p=19.}}</ref> and one of its largest: in 1898 more than 700 people worked for it.<ref name="Gwynne119">{{Harvnb|Gwynne|1986|p=119.}}</ref>  Longley moved his small firm from [[Turners Hill]] in 1881 when he bought Malthouse Farm and its brickworks.<ref name="Gwynne119"/>  Expansion was rapid, and they received commissions for [[Christ's Hospital]] school near Horsham, the King Edward VII [[sanatorium]] in [[Midhurst]], Graylingwell Hospital in [[Chichester]], the [[Choir (architecture)|choir stalls]] in [[Westminster Abbey]] and almost every railway station owned by the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]].<ref name="Gwynne119"/><ref name="VCH18407">{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18407|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 3 <U+2013> Bramber Rape (North-Eastern Part) including Crawley New Town.
