Since its opening in 2003, the Dr Pepper Ballpark has won awards and garnered praise for its unique design, feel, and numerous facilities. In his design, park architect David M.

==History==
[[Image:Dr pepper seven up ballpark logo.gif|left|thumb|Former logo of the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Ballpark]]
In 2001, [[Mandalay Entertainment|Mandalay Sports Entertainment]], owner of the Shreveport SwampDragons [[Class AA]] baseball team, reached an agreement with Southwest Sports Group to move the team to Frisco for the 2003 baseball season. As part of the deal, Southwest Sports Group assumed part-ownership of both the team and the ballpark to be built following the 2002 season.<ref name="SSGMSE">{{cite web|url=http://www.ridersbaseball.com/team/news/index.html?article_id=135|title=Southwest Sports Group and Mandalay Sports Entertainment Join Forces to Bring Professional Baseball|work=ridersbaseball.com|date=[[2001-12-03]]|accessdate=2006-07-14}}</ref> The project, designed by David M.

The ballpark serves as the anchor for a 74&nbsp;[[acre]] (0.3&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) [[United States dollar|US$]]300 million development project near the intersection of [[State Highway 121 (Texas)|State Highway 121]] and the [[Dallas North Tollway]].<ref name="SSGMSE"/> The project was jointly funded by the city of Frisco and Southwest Sports Group.  Frisco put forth [[United States dollar|US$]]67 million to build the complex, which was raised through special financing, unconnected to the city tax rate.<ref name="brokeground"/> On [[2003-01-21]], it was announced that local company [[Dr Pepper/Seven Up]] had purchased the naming rights for the new ballpark and retained exclusive non-alcoholic beverage rights for an undisclosed amount.<ref name="namingrights"/>

The ballpark opened for its first game on [[2003-04-03]], a RoughRiders loss to the [[Tulsa Drillers]].<ref name="brokeground"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ridersbaseball.com/team/news/index.html?article_id=100|title=SOLD OUT.

==Other events at the ballpark==
As baseball is not a year-round event, Dr Pepper Ballpark is used for other functions throughout the year. The ballpark hosts corporate events, such as company softball games and movie nights, in addition to local charity events, such as [[5000 metres|5K runs]] and bike races.<ref name="bikerace"/> Since 2004, the park has hosted the "Tournament of Champions" high school baseball tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ridersbaseball.com/team/news/index.html?article_id=227|title=First Ever "Tournament of Champions" at Dr Pepper/Seven Up Ballpark is Almost Here|work=ridersbaseball.com|date=[[2004-03-10]]|accessdate=2006-08-03}}</ref>

Following its construction in [[2003]], the Dr Pepper Ballpark received the Texas Construction award for Best Architectural Design for 2003 and the surrounding sports complex received the Best Sports and Entertainment award for 2003.<ref name="txconst"/> It was named the best new ballpark in the country by BaseballParks.com.<ref name="ridersbest"/><ref name="parkscom"/> MinorLeagueNews.com has also named the park number two on its top ten minor league ballparks for 2004 and number seven for 2005.<ref name="MLN">{{cite web|url=http://www.minorleaguenews.com/baseball/features/articles2005/04/21/08.html|title=Dr. Pepper/Seven Up Ballpark - No. 7 Pick in the MLN Top Ten (10) Minor League Ballparks 2005|work=MLN Sports Zone - A Minor League News Magazine|accessdate=2006-07-14}}</ref>

The design of the Dr Pepper Ballpark was spearheaded by David M. Schwarz. Schwarz had a stated goal of creating a "park within a (ball)park" in the stadium. To achieve this effect, the nine interconnected pavilions, where concessions, restrooms, and luxury suites are located, are built separately from the main seating area. The space between these pavilions allows for improved air flow in the Texas heat; the wind can move through the buildings and is not impeded by their presence.<ref name="parkscom"/> Constructed of [[fiber cement siding]], architectural critics have commented that their layout and material choice enhances the village-like feel of the ballpark, giving it a "coastal [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] aesthetic".<ref name="txconst"/> Others have commented that the design is very reminiscent of [[Churchill Downs]] in [[Kentucky]].<ref name="parkscom"/>

The seating area is populated by 8,800 open-air fold-down stadium seats. The concourse area, between the pavilions and the seating area, wraps completely around the ballpark. Critics have commented positively on the 360 degree views afforded by this construction choice.<ref name="reviews">{{cite web|url=http://www.ballparkreviews.com/frisco/frisco.htm|title=Dr. Pepper / 7-Up Ballpark - Frisco, Texas|work=BALLPARKREVIEWS.COM|accessdate=2006-07-14}}</ref>

==Facilities==
In addition to fixed stadium seats, the ballpark also features twenty-seven luxury suites located on the second level of the ballpark, which feature patio balconies from which to view the game and closed-circuit television feeds of the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ridersbaseball.com/pagebank/index.html?id=803|title=The voice of business reason has spoken|work=ridersbaseball.com|accessdate=2006-07-14}}</ref> Also unusual, the [[bullpen]]s for each team are built into the stands behind the first and third base lines. This has received a mixed reaction from critics, with some calling it "contrived" and "pointless".<ref name="reviews"/> In the outfield, seating is available on the grass area. This area is branded "San Juan Hill", after the [[Battle of San Juan Hill]] in which the team's namesake [[Rough Riders]] fought.<ref name="faclist">{{cite web|url=http://www.ridersbaseball.com/team/news/index.html?article_id=99|title=RoughRider Rainout sent Crowd of 10,000-plus home early|work=ridersbaseball.com|date=[[2003-04-06]]|accessdate=2006-07-14}}</ref>

The park features a pool built just past the wall in right field, level with the top of the outfield fence. Groups can rent out the pool during the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ridersbaseball.com/pagebank/index.html?id=668|title=The new definition of cool|work=ridersbaseball.com|accessdate=2006-07-14}}</ref> Three exclusive members-only areas have also been setup around the park. The most prominent of these "Founder's Club" areas, situated below the press box behind home plate, is a private, air-conditioned bar and restaurant.<ref name="parkwatch"/>

==Non-architectural critical reaction==
Critics have taken issue with ticket prices at the ballpark, set at [[United States dollar|US$]]7, US$15, and US$18. While less expensive than ticket prices for major league ballparks, prices are among the highest in all minor league classes.<ref name="reviews"/> However, the ballpark has seen strong attendance despite these ticket prices. In its inaugural season, Dr Pepper Ballpark had an attendance of 675,620, ranking it fourth overall in all minor league baseball attendance for the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ridersbaseball.com/team/news/index.html?article_id=206|title=Frisco Fans Part of Record Setting Year|work=ridersbaseball.com|date=[[2003-09-26]]|accessdate=2006-07-15}}</ref>  The ballpark sold out for 53 RoughRiders home games that season, drawing an all-time high attendance of 11,836 on [[2003-07-04]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ridersbaseball.com/team/news/index.html?article_id=14|title=RoughRiders Celebrate Independence Day with a 5-1 Victory over Tulsa|work=ridersbaseball.com|date=[[2003-07-04]]|accessdate=2006-08-29}}</ref>
