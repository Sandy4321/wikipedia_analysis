The '''Long Range Desert Group''' ('''LRDG''') was a reconnaissance and raiding unit of the [[British Army during the Second World War]]. The commander of the [[Afrika Korps|German Afrika Corps]], [[Field Marshal]] [[Erwin Rommel]], admitted that the LRDG "caused us more damage than any other British unit of equal strength".<ref>Gross, O'Carroll and Chiarvetto 2009, p.21</ref>

Originally called the Long Range Patrol (LRP), the unit was founded in [[Egypt]] in June 1940 by [[Major]] [[Ralph A. Bagnold]], acting under the direction of [[General]] [[Archibald Wavell]]. Bagnold was assisted by [[Captain (land)|Captain]] [[Pat Clayton|Patrick Clayton]] and Captain [[Bill Kennedy Shaw|William Shaw]]. At first the majority of the men were from [[New Zealand]], but they were soon joined by [[Rhodesia]]n and [[United Kingdom|British]] volunteers, whereupon new sub-units were formed and the name was changed to the better-known Long Range Desert Group (LRDG). The LRDG never numbered more than 350 men, all of whom were volunteers.

The LRDG was formed specifically to carry out deep penetration, covert reconnaissance patrols and intelligence missions from behind Italian lines, although they sometimes engaged in combat operations. Because the LRDG were experts in desert navigation they were sometimes assigned to guide other units, including the [[Special Air Service]] and [[secret agents]] across the desert. During the [[Western Desert Campaign|Desert Campaign]] between December 1940 and April 1943, the vehicles of the LRDG operated constantly behind the [[Axis powers|Axis]] lines, missing a total of only 15 days during the entire period.<ref name=goc19>Gross, O'Carroll and Chiarvetto 2009, p.19</ref> Possibly their most notable offensive action was during [[Operation Caravan]], an attack on the town of [[Barca|Barce]] and its associated airfield, on the night of 13 September 1942. However, their most vital role was the 'Road Watch', during which they [[clandestine operation|clandestinely]] monitored traffic on the main road from [[Tripoli]] to [[Benghazi]], transmitting the intelligence to the [[British Army]] Headquarters.

With the surrender of the Axis forces in [[Tunisia]] in May 1943, the LRDG changed roles and moved operations to the eastern [[Mediterranean]], carrying out missions in the [[Greek islands]], [[Italy]] and the [[Balkans]]. After the end of the war in Europe, the leaders of the LRDG made a request to the [[War Office]] for the unit to be transferred to the [[Far East]] to conduct operations against the [[Japanese Empire]]. The request was declined and the LRDG was disbanded in August 1945.

==Formation==
On 23 June 1940, [[Major]] [[Ralph Alger Bagnold|Ralph Bagnold]] met with [[General]] [[Archibald Wavell]], the commander of the [[Middle East Command]] in [[Alexandria]]. He explained his concept for a group of men intended to undertake long range reconnaissance patrols behind the Italian lines, into [[Libya]], to gather intelligence.<ref name=has34/>
General Wavell was familiar with desert warfare, having been a liaison officer with the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] during the [[First World War]],<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=18 May 2010|publisher=Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives, [[King's College London]]|title=Wavell|url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/frames/fulldesc?inst_id=21&coll_id=227}}</ref> and he understood and endorsed Bagnold's suggested concept. Wavell assisted in equipping the force.<ref name=has34>Haskew 2007, p.34</ref>

The unit, initially known as the '''No.1 Long Range Patrol Unit''' (LRP), was founded on 3 July 1940.<ref name=has34/> Bagnold wanted men who were energetic, innovative, self-reliant, physically and mentally tough, and able to live and fight in seclusion in the Libyan desert.<ref name=db316>Doyle and Bennett 2002, p.316</ref> Bagnold felt that [[New Zealand]] farmers would possess these attributes and was given permission to approach the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] for volunteers; over half the division volunteered.<ref name=db316/> Two officers and 85 [[other ranks]] including 18 administrative and technical personnel were eventually selected, coming mostly from the [[Divisional Cavalry Regiment (New Zealand)|Divisional Cavalry Regiment]] and the [[27th Machine-Gun Battalion (New Zealand)|27th Machine-Gun Battalion]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=24 May 2010|publisher=[[New Zealand Electronic text centre]]|title=Long Range Desert Group|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Doc-c15.html}}</ref> Once the men had been recruited, they started training in desert survival techniques and desert driving and navigation, with additional training in radio communications and demolitions.<ref name=has34/>

The LRP could initially only form three units known as patrols,{{#tag:ref|'Patrol' was capitalised when referring to a specific unit (for example, 'Y' Patrol) within the LRP and LRDG.<ref>O'Carroll 2000, p.3</ref> |group=nb}} but a doubling of strength allowed the addition of a new Heavy Section.<ref name="Jenlist12">Jenner and List 1999, pp.8<U+2013>9, 12</ref> In November 1940, the name of the LRP was changed to the '''Long Range Desert Group''' (LRDG),<ref name=mo16/> and the New Zealanders were joined by volunteers from British and Rhodesian regiments.<ref>Molinari 2007, pp.16<U+2013>17</ref> The British volunteers, who came mostly from the [[Brigade of Guards]] and [[Yeomanry]] regiments, were incorporated into their own patrols.<ref name=db316/> The original patrol unit consisted of two officers and 28 other ranks, equipped with a [[Canadian Military Pattern truck|Canadian Military Pattern (CMP)]] [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] 15 [[hundredweight|Imperial hundredweight]] (cwt) truck and 10 [[Chevrolet]] 30 cwt trucks. In March 1941 new types of trucks were issued and the patrol units were split into half-patrols of one officer and 15<U+2013>18 men in five to six vehicles.<ref name="Jenlist12"/> Each patrol incorporated a [[medic|medical orderly]], a [[navigator]], a [[radio operator]] and a [[Auto mechanic|vehicle mechanic]], each of whom manned a truck equipped for their role.<ref name=db317>Doyle and Bennett 2002, p.317</ref>

==Patrols==
[[File:LRDG RADIO TRUCK.jpg|thumb|alt=Vehicle going down a steep embankment.|'R' Patrol Chevrolet WB radio truck; the [[Antenna (radio)|rod antenna]] can be seen on the right. The man at the rear is manning a [[Boys anti-tank rifle]]]]
The Long Range Patrol comprised a 15 man headquarters with Bagnold in command. There were three sub-units: 'R' Patrol commanded by Captain [[Donald Gavin Steele]], 'T' Patrol commanded by Captain [[Patrick Clayton]] and  'W' Patrol commanded by Captain [[Edward 'Teddy' Cecil Mitford]]. 'T' and 'W' Patrols were combat units while 'R' Patrol was intended to be a support unit.<ref name=mo15>Molinari 2007, p.15</ref>

In November 1940, the LRP was reorganized and re-designated the Long Range Desert Group. It was expanded to six Patrols: 'T','W' and 'R' Patrols were joined by 'G', 'S' and 'Y' Patrols. Each patrol was expected to belong to the same regimental group, but only the Brigade of Guards and the Yeomanry regiments formed their own Patrols, 'G' and 'Y' respectively.<ref name=mo15>Molinari 2007, pp.15<U+2013>16</ref> The men of 'G' Patrol were drawn from the 3rd Battalion [[Coldstream Guards]] and the 2nd Battalion [[Scots Guards]] under command of Captain Michael Crichton-Stuart.<ref name=mo16>Molinari 2007, p.16</ref> The 'Y' Patrol men were drawn from the [[Nottinghamshire Yeomanry]] under command Captain P. J. D. McCraith, with additional men from the [[Northumberland Fusiliers]] and the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]].<ref>Molinari 2007, pp.17<U+2013>18</ref>  In December 1940, 'W' Patrol was disbanded and its personnel used to bring 'R' and 'T' Patrols up to strength,<ref name=mo15/> while 'G' Patrol took over their vehicles.<ref>List and Jenner 1999, p.12</ref> By June 1941 the LRDG was re-organised into two [[Squadron (cavalry)|squadron]]s: the New Zealand and Rhodesian 'A' Squadron with 'S', 'T' and 'R' Patrols, and 'B' Squadron with 'G', 'H' and 'Y' Patrols. There was also a Headquarters Section along with [[Military communications|signals]], [[Surveying|survey]] and [[Light Aid Detachment|light repair]] sections. A Heavy section, initially equipped with four 6-ton [[Marmon-Herrington]] trucks,{{#tag:ref|As the Heavy Section expanded the Marmon-Herringtons were replaced by four [[White Motor Company|White 10-ton]] trucks. The Whites were later replaced by [[Mack Trucks|Mack NR 9]] trucks; by 1943 the Heavy Section was equipped with 20 CMP Ford F60s.<ref>Jenner and List 1999, pp.10<U+2013>11</ref>|group=nb}} was used to provide logistical support by transporting supplies to bases and setting up hidden replenishment points at pre-arranged locations.<ref name="Gross, O p.18"/> In addition there was an Air Section, using [[Waco Aircraft Company|Waco]] [[Waco Custom Cabin Series|YQC-6 and a ZGC-7 biplanes]], which transported key personnel, [[Medevac|evacuated wounded]] and perform other liaison tasks.<ref>Jenner and List 1999, pp.9, 27, 45<U+2013>46</ref>

In August 1941 an artillery unit was formed to attack Italian forts more effectively. Initially it used a [[QF 4.5 inch Howitzer]] carried on a 10 ton [[Mack Trucks|Mack NR 4]] truck, with an accompanying light [[tank]] as an armoured [[observation post]]. However, these were handed over to the [[Free French]] at [[Kufra]]. The unit was then issued a [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|25 pounder]] [[portee]]. After successfully attacking and capturing the [[El Gtafia]] fort, the truck had to be abandoned and the experiment ended.<ref name="Jenlist 11"/>

===Squadrons===

The weapons are the [[Lewis gun]] (left) and a [[Browning M1919|.303 Browning Mk II]] (right)]]
In October 1941 the LRDG was expanded to 10 patrols by the simple method of splitting the existing patrols into two half patrols; the New Zealanders formed A Squadron comprising 'R1', 'R2', 'T1', and 'T2' Patrols and the British and Rhodesians formed B Squadron comprising 'G1', 'G2', 'S1', 'S2', 'Y1', and 'Y2' Patrols. The 'H' Patrol had been disbanded in September 1941 after three months service.<ref>Molinari 2007, pp.20<U+2013>21</ref>

These two squadrons were joined in December 1941 by the [[Indian Long Range Squadron]], which had been formed by volunteers from the [[2nd Lancers (Gardner's Horse)|2nd Lancers]], [[11th Prince Albert Victor's Own Cavalry (Frontier Force)|11th Cavalry]] and the [[18th King Edward's Own Cavalry|18th Cavalry]], all part of the [[3rd Indian Motor Brigade]].<ref name=mo23/> The Indian Squadron was organized along ethnic and religious lines with the first two patrols originally known as 'J' ([[Jats]]) and 'R' ([[Rajput]]) Patrols. Their designations were changed to 'I1' and 'I2' to avoid confusion.<ref name=mo23>Molinari 2007, p.23</ref> In October 1942 two further Indian patrols were formed: 'M' ([[Muslim]]) and 'S' ([[Sikh]]) Patrols, which became the 'I3' and 'I4' Patrols.<ref name=mo23/> [[No. 1 Demolition Squadron]], commanded by Major [[Vladimir Peniakoff|Vladimir 'Popski' Peniakoff]], was briefly attached to the LRDG from December 1942.
<ref name="Jenlist13">Jenner and List 1999, p.13</ref>

The vehicles of each patrol adopted their own markings. The New Zealand 'R' Patrol used a green [[Hei-tiki]] with a red tongue painted on the right side of the [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] of the vehicle and on the left they put a [[M<U+0101>ori language|M<U+0101>ori]] place name beginning with the letter 'R' (for example, '[[Rotowaro]]').<ref name="JenListBad99">Jenner and List 1999, pp.24<U+2013>32</ref> The 'T' Patrol vehicles had a black [[Kiwi]] over green 'grass' and a M<U+0101>ori name starting with 'Te' (for example, '[[Te Anau]]') in the corresponding places.<ref name="JenListBad99"/> The 'W' Patrol vehicles had a M<U+0101>ori name or word starting with 'W' painted on their vehicles.<ref name="JenListBad99"/>

The British 'G' Patrol vehicles carried no distinctive markings, although some vehicles had the Guards insignia. They took over 'W' Patrol's vehicles when that unit was disbanded.<ref name="JenListBad99"/> The 'Y' Patrol vehicles were slightly different; 'Y1' half-patrol vehicles all had names of famous drinking establishments (such as 'Cock O<U+2019> The North') and 'Y2' half-patrol had names from the [[Three Musketeers]] books (for example, '[[Aramis]]') on the left side of their vehicle bonnets.<ref name="JenListBad99"/> The Headquarters Section used a sequence of letters arranged in a square (see photo of "Louise").<ref>Jenner and List 1999, p.30</ref> The Rhodesian 'S' Patrol vehicles had names with a Rhodesian connection (such as '[[Harare|Salisbury]]') painted on the left side of the vehicles' bonnets.<ref name="JenListBad99"/> By 1943 the practice of naming replacement vehicles was dropped.<ref>O'Carroll 2000, p. 50.</ref>

==Equipment==
===Vehicles===
[[File:Vickers armed LRDG trucks8.jpg|thumb|alt=vehicles in convoy, each crewed by three men, in a desert terrain|LRDG Headquarters Section (note markings on "Louise") of Chevrolet 30 cwt. The first two vehicles are armed with [[Vickers gun]]s, and have canvas sand mats rolled up and stored on the front wheel arches.]]
The LRDG vehicles were mainly [[two wheel drive]], chosen because they were lighter and used less fuel than [[four wheel drive]]. They were stripped of all non-essentials, including doors, windscreens and roofs. They were fitted with a bigger [[radiator]], a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] system, built up [[leaf spring]]s for the harsh terrain, wide, low pressure [[Tire|desert tyres]], sand mats and channels,{{#tag:ref|The steel channels and canvas sand mats were used to release a vehicle caught in soft terrain. This entailed unloading the vehicle and digging shallow, sloped trenches in which the channels and mats could be placed under the wheels to provide traction.<ref name="Jenlist18"/>|group=nb}} plus map containers and a [[sun compass]] devised by Bagnold.<ref name=db317/> [[Wireless]] trucks had special compartments built into the bodywork to house wireless equipment.<ref name="Jenlist 11">Jenner and List 1999, p.11</ref> Initially the LRDG patrols were equipped with one CMP Ford 15 cwt F15 truck for the commander, while the rest of the patrol used up to 10 Chevrolet 30 cwt WB trucks.<ref name="Jenlistbad10-11">Jenner and List 1999, pp.10<U+2013>11</ref> From March 1941 the Chevrolets were replaced by the CMP Ford 30 cwt F30, which, because they were four wheel drive and heavier than the Chevrolets, used twice as much fuel, which in turn reduced the range of a patrol.<ref name="Jenlist 11"/>{{#tag:ref|Because the bulk of the load carried by an LRDG truck was petrol, any increase in fuel consumption meant that there was less room for other essential supplies.<ref>Gibson 2009, p. 8</ref> |group=nb}} These were replaced from March 1942 with 200 Canadian Chevrolet 1533 X2 30 cwts which had been specially ordered for the LRDG.<ref name="Jenlistbad10-11"/>{{#tag:ref|The 1533X2 was essentially a civilian commercial truck converted and equipped for military use; these trucks were identified as Modified Conventional Pattern (MCP) rather than the purpose-built CMPs.<ref>Jenner and List 1999, pp.28<U+2013>29 and 46</ref>|group=nb}} From July 1942 [[Willys MB|Willys Jeeps]] began to be issued for the patrol commander and patrol [[sergeant]].<ref name="db317"/><ref name="Jenlist13"/>

===Weapons===
[[Image:Boforswb.jpg|thumb|left|alt=four wheeled truck mounting a large artillery piece at the rear and a Lewis gun at the front. The three man crew can also be seen|A Chevrolet WB with a [[Bofors 37 mm]] [[anti-tank]] [[gun]] mounted  at the rear]]
The patrol vehicles were initially armed with 11 [[Lewis gun|Lewis machine guns]], four [[Boys anti-tank rifle]]s and a [[Bofors 37 mm]] [[anti-tank]] gun distributed amongst their vehicles.<ref name=db317/> By December 1940, the vehicle armaments had been improved and 'T' Patrol, for example, had five .303 [[Vickers machine guns|Vickers Medium Mk. I]] machine guns, five Lewis guns, four Boys anti-tank guns and the Bofors 37&nbsp;mm.<ref>Gross, O'Carroll and Chiarvetto 2002, pp.20<U+2013>22</ref> Another Vickers gun used was the heavy [[Vickers .50 machine gun]], which would be mounted at the rear of the vehicle.<ref>O'Carroll 2000, p.64</ref> All of the unit's vehicles were armed with at least one gun; each vehicle was fitted with six to eight gun mountings, but normally only two or three of them would be in use.<ref>Molinari 2007, p.83</ref>

Supplementing their army-supplied weapons, the LRDG was equipped with surplus [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) weapons. The most widely used of these was the [[Vickers K machine gun]], which was sometimes used mounted in pairs.<ref>O'Carroll 2000, p.67</ref> From mid-1941 the LRDG acquired [[Browning M1919|.303 Browning Mk II's]] from RAF stocks; these weapons were usually mounted in pairs, with a combined rate of fire of 2,400 rounds per minute.<ref>O'Carroll 2000, pp.65<U+2013>66</ref> When new vehicles were issued in March 1942, several were converted to carry captured dual-purpose 20 mm [[Breda Model 35]]s, which replaced the Bofors 37&nbsp;mm, and each half-patrol was equipped with one Breda "Gun truck".<ref>O'Carroll 2000, p.65</ref> In September 1942 the [[M2 Browning machine gun#Aircraft guns|.50 Browning AN/M2]] heavy machine gun began to replace the Vickers medium and heavy machine guns, and the Boys anti-tank rifle.<ref>O'Carroll 2000, p.66</ref>

The men of the LRDG carried the standard [[List of World War II weapons of the United Kingdom#Small arms|British Second World War small arms]], the [[Lee-Enfield#Short Magazine Lee-Enfield Mk III|Short Magazine Lee-Enfield (SMLE) No.1 Mk III*]] being the primary rifle.<ref name="Gib9">Gibson 2009, p.9</ref>{{#tag:ref|Although some references refer to the [[Lee-Enfield#Rifle No 4|No. 4 Mk I]], it was not introduced into service until the spring of 1942<ref>Walter 2006, p.254</ref> and was rarely, if ever, used by the LRDG in the desert.<ref name="Gib9"/>|group=nb}} Other small arms carried were [[Thompson submachine gun]]s and .38 [[Enfield revolver|Enfield]], [[Webley & Scott]] or .45 [[Colt 1911A1]] pistols.<ref>O'Carroll 2000, p.72</ref> Several types of [[hand grenade]] were used: the [[Mills bomb]], [[No. 68 AT Grenade|No. 68 Anti-tank]] and [[No. 69 grenade|No. 69's]]. Each truck carried a Lee-Enfield EY rifle fitted with a discharger cup able to fire the No. 36M Mills [[rifle grenade]].<ref>O'Carroll 2000, p.68</ref> The LRDG also laid [[land mine]]s, the most common being the [[Mk 2 mine]]. [[Lewes bomb]]s and a custom made weapon using [[Plastic explosive|Nobel 808]] were used to destroy aircraft and other targets.<ref>O'Carroll  2000, pp.70<U+2013>71</ref>

Captured German and Italian small arms were also used, including the [[Beretta M 1934]], [[Luger P08 pistol|Luger P08]] and [[Walther P38]] pistols. The German [[MP38]] and [[MP40]] [[submachine gun]]s, and the heavier German [[MG34]] and [[MG42]], and Italian [[Breda M37]] and [[Breda M38]] [[machine gun]]s were also captured and put to use.<ref name=mol82>Molinari 2007, p.82</ref>

===Communications===
[[File:V wireless.jpg|alt=man smoking wearing radio headphones between two very closely parked vehicles |thumb|A radio operator of 'R1' Patrol. The rod aerial is just above his head. The four wooden support poles for the Wyndom dipole antenna are carried on brackets on the wooden 'greedy boards'.

In the LRP most of the radio operators were New Zealanders, but the LRDG radio operators were all from the [[Royal Corps of Signals]]. These men were skilled in communications and were able to maintain and repair their equipment without any outside help. On only three occasions did a broken radio prevent a patrol communicating with its headquarters.<ref name="O'Carroll, 2000, p 55">O'Carroll 2000, p.55</ref> All LRDG patrols included one vehicle equipped with an [[Army No. 11 Wireless Set]] and a non-military [[Philips]] model 635 receiver. The No 11 Set had been designed for use in tanks, and had [[transmitter]] and [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] circuits;<ref name=no11set>{{cite web|accessdate=24 May 2010|publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)]]|title=Wireless Set No 11|url=http://www2.armynet.mod.uk/museums/royalsignals/wirelesssetno11.htm}}</ref> the Royal Signals expected to use the No. 11 set to transmit and receive between {{convert|3|mi}} and {{convert|20|mi}} with the use of {{convert|6|ft}} or {{convert|9|ft}} [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]].<ref name=no11set/>
The LRDG used [[Morse code]] for all transmissions, and were able to transmit over great distances using either a [[dipole antenna]] system attached to a {{convert|6.3|ft}} [[rod antenna]] mounted on the truck which was adequate up to {{convert|500|mi}},<ref name = "O'Carroll, 2000, p 55"/> or for greater distances, a Wyndom dipole system slung between two {{convert|17|ft}} tall poles.<ref name = "O'Carroll, 2000, p 55"/>  The disadvantage of using the Wyndom system was that it took time to erect and work out the correct antenna length, so it could only be used in a relatively safe area.<ref>Molinari 2007, p.79</ref> To power the No. 11 set extra batteries had to be carried by the radio vehicles.<ref name = "O'Carroll, 2000, p 55"/>
The Phillips receiver was used to monitor [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) time checks.<ref name="Jenlist18">Jenner and List 1999, p.18</ref>{{#tag:ref|On occasion the Phillips was used to listen to [[BBC]] radio or music like the song [[Lili Marleen]].<ref name="Jenlist18"/>|group=nb}}

While on the move the lead vehicles of the patrol commanders and sergeants flew a small flag. Because the LRP was organised on divisional cavalry lines the leaders carried green flags for 'A' (HQ) Troop, black for 'B' Troop, yellow for 'C' Troop and red for 'D'.<ref name="O'Carroll50">O'Carroll 2000, p.50</ref> When the LRDG was organised into 11 vehicle patrols this was simplified to a green flag displaying the patrol letter in white; the later half-patrols used a plain green flag on occasion. When it became necessary to change course from an intended route, or in the event of enemy action, patrol movements were controlled by a simple [[Flag semaphore|semaphore flag]] system using blue and white signal flags,{{#tag:ref|Some typical signals were 'Enemy in sight': a flag waved vertically, and 'Disperse': two horizontal flags waved up and down.<ref name="O'Carroll50"/>|group=nb}} or hand signals, depending on how widely dispersed the trucks were.<ref name="O'Carroll50"/>

===Navigation===
All trucks of the LRDG were equipped with the Bagnold sun compass and some trucks were also equipped with a [[magnetic compass|P8 Tank Compass]].<ref name="Kenshaw255">Kennedy Shaw 1943, p.255</ref> Each patrol had a navigator who always rode in the second truck in the formation. He was equipped with a [[theodolite]] and [[Ephemeris|astronomical position tables]] with which to plot [[Celestial navigation|star sightings]], and maps.<ref>Kennedy Shaw 1943, pp.254<U+2013>256</ref> Watches were used and adjusted each evening using the GMT time check.<ref name="Kenshaw255"/> One major problem faced early on by the LRDG was a lack of accurate maps for Libya in particular. Patrols had to do their own surveys and make their own maps of each route they took. In July 1941 the Survey Section was formed to carry out this task.<ref>Kennedy Shaw 1943, pp.257<U+2013>258</ref>

The only water in the area is found in a number of small [[oases]], which is also where the only vegetation grows.<ref name=mol6/>

The first LRP patrol began during the [[Italian invasion of Egypt]]. 'W' Patrol commanded by Captain Mitford set out on 15 September 1940 to carry out a reconnaissance of [[Kufra]] and [[Uweinat]]. Finding no trace of the Italians, they turned south and attacked fuel dumps, aircraft and an Italian convoy carrying supplies to Kufra.<ref>Morgan 2003, p.6</ref> 'T' Patrol, commanded by Captain Clayton, reconnoitred the main route between Kufra and Uweinat, then drove south to meet up with 'W' Patrol; both units returned to base, having captured two Italian trucks and official mail.<ref>Bagnold 1945, p.36</ref> The Italian response to these raids was to reduce their front line forces and increase the number of troops garrisoning the area from 2,900 men in September to 5,500 by November 1940.<ref>Molinari 2007, p.89</ref>
On 27 December 1940, 'G' and 'T' Patrols left Cairo and crossed the desert to northwest of Kufra. On arrival they met with representatives from the [[Free French]] forces in [[Chad]], and on 11 January carried out a joint raid on the Italian fort at [[Murzuk]].<ref>Bagnold 1945, pp.38<U+2013>39</ref> After two hours' fighting the fort remained in Italian hands, but the adjoining airfield had been destroyed. The units then withdrew southwards towards the Free French post at [[Zouar]]. On 31 January they were intercepted by the [[Auto-Saharan Company|Compagnia Autosahariana di Cufra]], an Italian unit similar to the LRDG, in the [[Gebel Sherif]] valley.<ref>Gross, Chiarvetto and O'Carroll 2009, pp.10<U+2013>17</ref> The LRDG had one man killed and three men captured, including Major Clayton, and three trucks destroyed during the battle. The Italians losses were five killed and three wounded, and one truck was abandoned.<ref>Gross, Chiarvetto and O'Carroll 2009, pp.95<U+2013>105</ref> Four member of the LRDG escaped by walking {{convert|200|mi}} to safety in ten days with no food and only a two [[gallon]] water can between them.<ref> Bagnold 1945, p.39</ref> The patrol arrived back in Egypt on 9 February; it had covered about {{convert|4500|mi}}, experiencing the loss of six trucks, four by enemy action and two by mechanical breakdowns. One vehicle with a broken rear axle had been towed about {{convert|900|mi}} before it could be repaired. Total casualties were three dead and three captured. Major Clayton was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=18 May 2010|publisher=[[New Zealand Electronic text centre]]|title=Raids in the Fezzan|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Epi-c2-WH2-1Epi-e.html}}</ref>

After [[Operation Compass]] ended with the Italians forced out of [[Cyrenaica]] it was decided to move the LRDG from Cairo to Kufra. At the same time the LRDG was expanded with the addition of 'Y' and 'S'  Patrols.<ref name=oasis/> When the German [[Afrika Korps]] under command of General [[Erwin Rommell]] counter attacked in April 1941, the LRDG was ordered to reinforce the Kufra area. 'R' Patrol were based at [[Taiserbo]], 'S' Patrol at [[Zighen]], and the headquarters LRDG, 'T' Patrol, and the Free French were at Kufra, under command of Bagnold. The detached 'G' and 'Y' Patrols were based at [[Siwa Oasis]], under command of [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]].<ref name=oasis>{{cite web|accessdate=18 May 2010|publisher=[[New Zealand Electronic text centre]]|title=Occupation of the Southern Oases|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Epi-c2-WH2-1Epi-e.html}}</ref>

The LRDG air link was created during the occupation of Kufra by Major [[Guy Lenox Prendergast]]. Appreciating the value of aircraft for reconnaissance, liaison, evacuating wounded and flights to GHQ Cairo, he had two [[Waco Aircraft Company|Waco aircraft]] fitted with long range fuel tanks. Prendergast flew one himself and [[Sergeant]] R. F. T. Barker flew the other. When Bagnold was appointed to the [[General Staff]] Cairo in August 1941, Prendergast was given command of the LRDG.<ref name=oasis/>

The LRDG now began a series of patrols behind the Axis lines. Near the end of July 'T' Patrol left for the desert to the south of the [[Gulf of Sirte]]. One 'T' Patrol truck managed to observe the main coastal road, along which Axis traffic was passing. They were followed two or three weeks later by 'S' Patrol, who carried out a similar reconnaissance between [[Jalo oasis]] and [[Agedabia]]. Both patrols returned safely to Kufra without being discovered. In August 1941 'R' Patrol relieved 'G' and 'Y' Patrols at Siwa and was joined by 'T' Patrol in October.<ref name=oasis/>

===Eighth Army command===
[[File:LRDG guards 1.jpg|thumb|alt=stationary four wheeled vehicle with only the driver on board|A [[Vickers K machine gun|Vickers K]] armed [[Jeep]] of 'G' Patrol on the way to Barce during Operation Caravan, September 1942.]]
In November 1941 the LRDG, now under command of the newly formed [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]], moved from Kufra to Siwa. The patrols were tasked to watch the desert tracks south of [[Jebel Akhdar (Libya)|Jebel Akhdar]] and report any signs of reinforcements and withdrawals. The 'R1' Patrol was tasked with collecting Captain [[David Stirling]] and 30 men who had parachuted behind the lines to raid airfields to the west of [[Tobruk]]. Only 21 men arrived at the rendezvous and were returned to the British lines. They later became the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS), and the next time they raided Axis airfields they were taken there and back by the LRDG.<ref name=eighth/>  In early November the 'T2' Patrol was tasked to take four British officers to the Gebel and to return and collect them three weeks later. The officers were the advance land party of [[Operation Flipper]] which had planned to kill General Rommel.<ref name=eighth>{{cite web|accessdate=18 May 2010|publisher=[[New Zealand Electronic text centre]]|title=In Support of the Eighth Army|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Epi-c4-WH2-1Epi-e.html}}</ref>

On 24 November, in support of [[Operation Crusader]], the LRDG were ordered to attack Axis rear areas. Already on patrol, 'Y1' and 'Y2' Patrols attacked targets in the [[Mechili]], [[Derna]] and [[Gazala]] area. 'Y1' damaged fifteen vehicles in a transport park and 'Y2' captured a small fort and about 20 Italians. The 'S2' and 'R2' Patrols attacked targets in the [[Benghazi]], [[Barce]] and [[Maraua]] area, where they ambushed nine vehicles. The 'G1' and 'G2' Patrols were assigned the main road near [[Agedabia]] where 'G1' made two attacks on road traffic and shot up a few vehicles. After the Axis forces withdrew from Cyrenaica the LRDG moved to a base at [[Jalo oasis]], about {{convert|140|mi}} to the south-south-east of [[Agedabia]].<ref name=eighth/>

Their last operations of 1941 were in December, when the LRDG twice ferried the SAS to and from raids on Axis airfields. They attacked the airfields at [[Sirt]]e (twice), [[El Agheila]], [[Agedabia]], [[Nofilia]] and [[Tamit]], destroying 151 aircraft and 30 vehicles.<ref name=sho8/> During the second raid at Sirte, the SAS devised a new method of attacking parked aircraft. They drove the LRDG trucks between the rows of aircraft, which were then engaged by machine guns and hand grenades. Previous to this the procedure had been to quietly infiltrate an airfield and place [[Lewis bomb]]s on aircraft and vehicles, leaving before the bombs exploded, but this attack was so successful that it became the preferred method for attacking airfields.<ref name=sho8>Shortt 1981, p.8</ref>

===Road watch===

When the LRDG was based at Siwa, they took part in what has since became known as the 'Road Watch' along the [[Via Balbia]] (the [[Tripoli]] to [[Benghazi]] road).<ref name=kay13/> Three patrols were engaged on road watch duties at any one time. One would be watching the road for a week to 10 days, another would be en route to relieve them and the third was returning to Siwa after having been relieved.<ref name=kay14>Kay 2008, p.14</ref> The road was kept under constant observation around the clock from 2 March to 21 July 1942.<ref name=kay13>Kay 2008, p.13</ref> The site of the road watch was about {{convert|5|mi}} from the [[Marble Arch (Libya)|Marble Arch]] monument. Before dawn each day two men would move into position about {{convert|350|yd}} from the road. By day they would record the details of all vehicles and troop movements, and at night they would move to about {{convert|30|yd}} of the road and guess what type of vehicles were passing by their sound and outline. At daylight they were relieved by another pair of men who took over that day's road watch.<ref name=kay13/> If [[tank]]s or a large number of troops were seen passing they would radio the LRDG headquarters at Siwa immediately so that by the time the enemy reached the front line, GHQ at Cairo would know they were coming. Once a patrol was relieved they would transmit details of all the had seen back to Siwa.<ref>Kay 2008, pp.13<U+2013>14</ref> The LRDG did not lose any men or vehicles when on the road watch, but they did have some close encounters. On 21 March 'R1' Patrol was surrounded by a convoy of 27 vehicles and about 200 men who stopped for the night between the watchers and their vehicles.<ref name=kay14/> While the road watch was ongoing, other patrols would be attacking targets along other stretches of the Tripoli to Benghazi road, by planting mines or attacking vehicles with machine gun fire.<ref>Kay 2008, p.15</ref>

After the [[Battle of Gazala]] and the fall of [[Tobruk]] the LRDG were forced on 28 June to withdraw from Siwa. A Squadron withdrew to Cairo to resupply and then moved back to Kufra, while B Squadron moved to [[Faiyum]].<ref>Kay 2008, p.16</ref>

===Barce===

The vehicle is armed with two twin Browning machine guns.]]
With the Eighth Army now holding the [[El Alamein]] line, plans were submitted to attack the Axis supply lines and the ports of Benghazi and Tobruk.<ref name=kay17>Kay 2008, p.17</ref> In September 1942, [[British Commandos]] would attack Tobruk by land and sea ([[Operation Agreement]]). The SAS would attack Benghazi ([[Operation Bigamy]]) and the [[Sudan Defence Force]] would capture Jalo oasis ([[Operation Nicety]]).<ref name=kay17/> The LRDG would be used to guide the attacking forces to their targets and at the same time, a LRDG force would attack [[Barce]] ([[Operation Caravan]]). The Barce force consisted of 17 vehicles and 47 men of 'G1' and 'T1' Patrols, which had to travel {{convert|1155|mi}} to reach their target. On arrival 'T1' Patrol attacked the airfield and 'G1' the Barce barracks. The attack on the airfield destroyed 35 aircraft according to an Italian [[prisoner of war]].<ref>Kay 2008, pp.19<U+2013>21</ref> Official Italian figures quote 16 aircraft destroyed and seven damaged.<ref>O'Carroll 2000, p.62</ref>

On 30 September 1942, the LRDG ceased to be under command of the Eighth Army and came under direct command of GHQ Middle East.<ref>Public Record Office 2001, p.157</ref> The final LRDG operation in North Africa was in [[Tunisia]] during [[Operation Pugilist]] when they guided the 2nd New Zealand Division around the [[Mareth Line]] in March 1943.<ref name=jack111>Jackson 2006, p.111</ref>

===Post 1943 operations===
[[File:Easonsmith 1.jpg|right|thumb|alt=unkempt man in British Army uniform, with hands in pockets|LRDG commanding officer [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[John Richard Easonsmith]] [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] [[Military Cross|MC]] was killed in action during the [[battle of Leros]].]]
In May 1943 the LRDG was sent to [[Lebanon]] to retrain in mountain warfare.<ref>Kay 2008, p.37</ref> However, following the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Italian armistice in 1943]], they were sent to [[Leros]], one of the [[Dodecanese islands]], to serve as normal infantry. They later took part in the [[Battle of Leros]], where the commanding officer [[John Richard Easonsmith]] was killed and replaced by [[David Lloyd Owen]].<ref name=owen>{{cite web|accessdate=19 May 2010|publisher=''[[Daily Telegraph]]''|title=Obituary, David LLoyd Owen|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1310650/Major-General-David-Lloyd-Owen.html}}</ref> After the battle the last New Zealanders, two officers and approximately 46 men, were withdrawn from the LRDG and returned to their division.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=19 May 2010|title=New Zealand Squadron, Long Range Desert Group, in the Dodecanese Operations|publisher=[[New Zealand Electronic text centre]]|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-2Doc-c14.html}}</ref>

In December 1943, the LRDG re-organised into two squadrons of eight patrols. Each patrol contained one officer and 10 other ranks. Major [[Moir Stormonth Darling]] was given command of the British Squadron and Major [[Kenneth Henry Lazarus]] the Rhodesian Squadron. Patrols were then parachuted north of [[Rome]] to obtain information about German troop movements, and also carried out raids on the [[Dalmatian Islands]] and [[Corfu]].<ref name=owen/><ref name=darling>{{cite web|accessdate=18 May 2010|publisher=''[[Daily Telegraph]]''|title=Obituary,Colonel Moir Stormonth Darling |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1394312/Colonel-Moir-Stormonth-Darling.html}}</ref>

In August 1944, British Squadron patrols were parachuted into [[Yugoslavia]]. One patrol destroyed two {{convert|40|ft}} spans of a large railway bridge, which caused widespread disruption to the movement of German troops and supplies. The commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Owen and a team of 36 men were parachuted into [[Albania]] in September 1944. Their mission was to follow the German retreat and assist [[Albanian Resistance of World War II|Albanian resistance groups]] in attacking them.<ref>Pearson 2006, p.390</ref> In October 1944, two British Squadron patrols were parachuted into the [[Florina]] area of [[Greece]]. Here they mined a road used by the retreating Germans, destroying three vehicles and blocking the road. Firing on the stranded convoy from an adjacent hillside, they directed RAF aircraft in to destroy the rest of the convoy.<ref name=darling/>

After the end of the war in Europe, the leaders of the LRDG made a request to the [[War Office]] for the unit to be transferred to the [[Far East]] to conduct operations against the [[Japanese Empire]]. The request was declined and the LRDG was disbanded in August 1945.<ref name="O'Carrollsugg">O'Carroll 2000, pp.185<U+2013>189</ref><ref>Haskew 2007, p.36</ref>

==Legacy==
[[Image:LRDG Memorial at Papakura New Zealand.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Front end of a jeep, sticking out of brick wall with plaques on brick pillars either side|LRDG Memorial at [[Papakura Military Camp]], [[New Zealand]]]]
The Long Range Desert Group was disbanded at the end of the Second World War. The only comparable British Army units today are the Mobility troops of the Special Air Service. Each of the regular army Special Air Service squadrons has a Mobility troop. Like the LRDG, they are specialists in using vehicles, trained in an advanced level of motor mechanics to fix any problem with their vehicles, and are experts in desert warfare.<ref>Ryan 2009, p.150</ref><ref>Ryan 2009, p.97</ref>

The Long Range Desert Group are one of the Second World War units represented by the Special Air Service Association. Other wartime units represented include all the SAS regiments, the Special Raiding Squadron
, the [[Special Boat Service]] (Wartime), the [[GHQ Liaison Regiment|Phantom Signal Squadron]], the [[Raiding Support Regiment]] and the [[Sacred Band (World War II)|Greek Sacred Squadron]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=20 August 2010|publisher=Special Air Service Association|title=Units represented|url=http://www.marsandminerva.co.uk/units.htm|}}</ref>

The [[New Zealand Army]] erected a permanent memorial to the LRDG at the [[New Zealand Special Air Service]] barracks, in the [[Papakura Military Camp]]. On 7 August 2009, two honour boards containing details of every New Zealand soldier who served in the LRDG were unveiled.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=22 May 2010|publisher=[[New Zealand Army]]|title=Long Range Desert Group Honoured in Papakura|url=http://www.army.mil.nz/at-a-glance/news/army-news/401/lrdghip.htm}}</ref>
