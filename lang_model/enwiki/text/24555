The '''Illinois Central''' {{reporting mark|IC}}, sometimes called the '''''Main Line of Mid-America''''', was a [[Rail transport|railroad]] carrier in the central [[United States]], with its primary routes connecting [[Chicago, Illinois]] with [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and [[Birmingham, Alabama]].  A line also connected Chicago with [[Sioux City, Iowa]] (1870). There was a significant branch to [[Omaha, Nebraska]] (1899) west of [[Fort Dodge, Iowa]] and another branch reaching [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]] (1877) starting from [[Cherokee, Iowa]].

==History==
[[Image:1850 IC.jpg|thumb|200px|[[1850]] map]]
The IC was one of the earlier [[Class I railroad]]s in the US.  Its roots stretch back to abortive attempts by the [[Illinois General Assembly]] to charter a railroad linking the northern and southern parts of the state of [[Illinois]].  In 1850 U.S. President [[Millard Fillmore]] signed a [[land grant]] for the construction of the railroad, making the Illinois Central the first land-grant railroad in the United States.

The Illinois Central was officially chartered by the [[Illinois General Assembly]] on [[February 10]], [[1851]].<ref name="Steamtown, IC 790">Steamtown National Historic Site, ''[http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/steamtown/shs2i.htm Illinois Central Railroad number 790]''. Retrieved [[February 10]] [[2006]].</ref>  Upon its completion in 1856, the IC was the longest railroad in the world.  Its main line went from [[Cairo, Illinois]], at the southern tip of the state, to [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]], in the northwest corner.  A branch line went from [[Centralia, Illinois|Centralia]] (named for the railroad) to the rapidly growing city of [[Chicago]].  In Chicago, its tracks were laid along the shore of [[Lake Michigan]] and on an offshore causeway downtown, but landfilling and natural deposition have moved the present day shore to the east. 

In 1867 the Illinois Central extended its track into [[Iowa]].  Throughout the 1870s, and 1880s the IC acquired and expanded railroads throughout the southern United States.  IC lines crisscrossed the state of [[Mississippi]] and went as far as [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] to the south and [[Louisville, Kentucky]] in the east.  In the 1880s, northern lines were built to [[Dodgeville, Wisconsin]], [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]], and [[Omaha, Nebraska]].  Further expansion continued into the early twentieth century.

===Illinois Central Gulf Railroad: 1972-1988===
[[Image:Illinois Central Gulf Railroad Logo.jpg|thumb|left|100px|ICG logo.]]
On [[August 10]], [[1972]] the Illinois Central Railroad merged with the [[Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad]] to form the '''Illinois Central Gulf Railroad'''. On [[October 30]] that year the [[Illinois Central Gulf commuter rail crash]], the company's deadliest, occurred.  In the 1980s, the railroad spun off most of its east-west lines and many of its redundant north-south lines, including much of the former GM&O. Most of these lines were bought by other railroads, including entirely new railroads, such as the [[Chicago, Missouri and Western Railway]], [[Paducah and Louisville Railway]] and [[Chicago Central and Pacific Railroad]]. On [[February 29]], [[1988]], the ICG dropped the "Gulf" from its name and again became known as the Illinois Central Railroad.

===Canadian National Railway: 1998-present===
On [[February 11]], [[1998]] the IC was purchased by the [[Canadian National Railway]] (CN) with the integration of operations beginning on [[July 1]], [[1999]].

The IC is now controlled by CN's holding company [[Grand Trunk Corporation]].  The IC name continued to be used until after the railroad's [[sesquicentennial]] in 2001, after which the IC corporate identity slowly faded through CN's maintenance and repainting programs.  IC locomotives repainted into the CN paint scheme retain "IC" [[reporting marks]] and sub-lettering on the sides of locomotive cabs.

==Passenger train service==
The Illinois Central was a major carrier of passengers on its Chicago-New Orleans mainline and between Chicago and St. Louis. IC also ran passengers on its Chicago to Omaha line, though it was never among the top performers on this route. Illinois Central's largest passenger terminal, Central Station,  stood at 12th Street east of Michigan Avenue in Chicago.  Due to the railroad's north-south route from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes, Illinois Central passenger trains were one means of transport during the [[African American]] [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of the 1920s.

Illinois Central's most famous train was the ''[[Panama Limited]]'', a premier all-Pullman car service between Chicago, St. Louis, Missouri, and New Orleans. In 1967, due to losses incurred by the operation of the train, the Illinois Central combined the Panama Limited with a coach-only train called the ''[[Magnolia Star]]''. On [[June 1]], [[1971]] Amtrak took over the operation of the service, but shortly afterward dropped the name in favor of the ''[[City of New Orleans]]'', a daytime streamlined coach train that had been operated by the Illinois Central whose name was popularized by a song written by [[Steve Goodman]] and performed by [[Arlo Guthrie]] ([[Willie Nelson]] made the song #1 in 1984.). Illinois Central ran several other trains along the main route including ''The Creole'' and ''The Louisiane''.

The ''[[Green Diamond]]'' was the Illinois Central's premier train between Chicago, Springfield and St. Louis. Other important trains included the ''[[Hawkeye (passenger train)|Hawkeye]]'' which ran daily between Chicago and Sioux City and the City of Miami eventually running every other day between Chicago and Miami via the [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad|Atlantic Coast Line]], The [[Central of Georgia Railroad]] and [[Florida East Coast Railway]]. 

The Illinois Central was always a major [[Metra Electric Line|Chicago commuter line]] operating electrified trains from its Michigan Avenue stations to the southeast suburbs until this traffic was assumed by [[Metra]].

After 1971 Amtrak operated the ''Panama Limited'', later re-named ''City of New Orleans,'' over the Illinois Central mainline and the ''Shawnee'' between Chicago and Carbondale, Illinois. Amtrak presently runs three trains daily over this route, the ''City of New Orleans'' and the ''Illini'' and ''Saluki'' between Chicago and Carbondale. Another Illinois corridor service is planned for the former "Blackhawk" route between Chicago-Rockford and Dubuque. This service, subsidized by the State of Illinois is slated to begin in 2009.
