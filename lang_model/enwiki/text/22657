'''St Richard's Church, Ham''' is an [[Anglican]] church in Ashburnham Road, [[Ham, London]]. 

==History==
The church was built as part of a substantial housing development on land given by the construction company; [[Wates Group|Wates]]. The foundation stone was laid on 19 September 1964 by Norman Wates. During the construction, Wates provided access to a workmen's hut for the new and rapidly growing congregation to worship in.<ref name="HP2K">{{cite book |title=Ham and Petersham at 2000 |editor-first=Leonard |editor-last=Chave |publisher=Ham Amenities Group / Richmond Local History Society |date=1 May 2000|page=53 |isbn=9780952209942}}</ref>

Architect [[Ralph Covell]] based the design on the six-pointed [[Star of David]] creating an hexagonal space for worship to bring congregation and clergy closer together, as encouraged by the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The triangular points of the star form, clockwise from the east, the entrance, [[lady chapel]], parish room (''Nash Room''), [[vestry]], kitchen and children's area. [[Henry Haig]], then teaching at [[Kingston School of Art]], was commissioned to create the fourteen [[stained glass]] windows. Haig also painted the sacristy doors and made the original processional cross. The [[Abstract art|non-figurative]] designs of the windows and paintings are inspired by aspects of the life and work of St Richard.<ref name="Haig">{{cite web |url=http://www.dorsetlife.co.uk/2013/03/glass-of-haig/ |title=Glass of Haig | publisher=Dorset Magazine |month=March |year=2013 |accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref><ref name="info">{{cite |title=About the Church|date=20 May 2010| publisher=St Richards Church, Ham}} (Information sheet)</ref>

The tracker organ with electric blower, single manual keyboard, small pedal keyboard and nine stops, originally made in about 1900 by Bevington and Sons of London, was rebuilt in the church in 1965 by N. P. Mander Ltd.<ref name="info"/>

On 20 May 1966 the church was consecrated to [[Richard of Chichester|St Richard of Chichester]] by the Right Reverend [[Mervyn Stockwood]], then [[Anglican Bishop of Southwark|Bishop of Southwark]].

The kitchen and disabled facilities were improved in 1998.<ref name="HP2K"/> The children's area was developed in 2003 with the addition of folding screens and a mural. A large wooden cross that stands on the mound outside the church was constructed by local young people during 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.strichardsham.org.uk/history.html|title=The Building and its History |publisher=St Richard's Church, Ham|year=2006 |accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref><ref name="info"/>
