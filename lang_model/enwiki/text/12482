'''Wat Phou''' (Vat Phu) is a ruined [[Khmer people|Khmer]] temple complex in southern [[Laos]]. It is located at the base of mount Phu Kao, some 6 km from the [[Mekong river]] in [[Champasak Province|Champassak]] province. There was a temple on the site as early as the [[5th century]], but the surviving structures date from the 11th to 13th centuries. The temple has a unique structure, in which the elements lead to a shrine where a [[linga]] was bathed in water from a mountain [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]. The site later became a centre of [[Theravada Buddhist]] worship, which it remains today.

==History==
[[Image:Watphoupeaklinga03.jpg|left|thumb|The mountain has a natural [[linga]] on its peak.]]
Wat Phou was initially associated with the city of Shrestapura, which lay on the bank of the [[Mekong]] directly east of mount Lingaparvata (now called Phu Kao).{{ref|PRAL01}} By the latter part of the [[5th century]] the city was already the capital of a kingdom which texts and inscriptions connect with both [[Chenla]] and [[Champa]], and the first structure on the mountain was constructed around this time.{{ref|Free01}} The mountain gained spiritual importance from the [[linga]]-shaped protuberance on its summit; the mountain itself was therefore considered the home of [[Shiva]], and the river as representing the ocean or the [[Ganges River]].{{ref|UN01}} The temple was naturally dedicated to Shiva, while the water from the [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] which emerges directly behind the temple was considered sacred.

Wat Phou was a part of the [[Khmer empire]], centred on [[Angkor]] to the southwest, at least as early as the reign of [[Yashovarman I]] in the early [[10th century]]. Shrestapura was superseded by a new city in the [[Angkor]]ian period, located directly south of the temple.{{ref|UN02}} In the later period, the original buildings were replaced, re-using some of the stone blocks; the temple now seen was built primarily during the [[Koh Ker]] and [[Baphuon]] periods of the [[11th century]]. Minor changes were made during the following two centuries, before the temple, like most in the empire, was converted to [[Theravada Buddhist]] use. This continued after the area came under control of the [[Lao people|Lao]], and a festival is held on the site each February. Little restoration work has been done, other than the restoration of boundary posts along the path. Wat Phou was designated a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2001.

==The site==
[[Image:Watphouplan01.png|thumb|500px|A plan of Wat Phou: proportions and positions are approximate.]]
Like most Khmer temples, Wat Phou is orientated towards the east. although the axis actually faces eight degrees south of due east, being determined primarily by the orientation of the mountain and the river. Including the [[Architecture of Cambodia#Srahs and barays|barays]] it stretches 1.4 km east from the source of the spring, at the base of a cliff 100 m up the hill. 6 km east of the temple, on the west bank of the Mekong, lay the city, while a road south from the temple itself led to other temples and ultimately to the city of Angkor.

[[Image:Wpfacade02a.jpg|thumb|The facade of the sanctuary. The Buddha image inside is modern.]]Approached from the city (of which little remains), the first part of the temple reached is a series of [[Architecture of Cambodia#Srahs and barays|barays]]. Only one now contains water, the 600 by 200 m middle baray which lies directly along the temples's axis; there were further reservoirs north and south of this, and a further pair on each side of the causeway between the middle baray and the palaces.

The two palaces stand on a terrace on either side of the axis. They are known as the north and south palaces or, without any evidence, the men's and women's palaces (the term "palace" is also a mere convention &mdash; their purpose is unknown). Each consisted of a rectangular courtyard with a corridor and entrance on the side towards the axis, and [[Architecture of Cambodia#Blind doors and windows|false door]]s at the east and west ends. The courtyards of both buildings have [[laterite]] walls; the walls of the northern palace's corridor are also laterite, while those of the southern palace are [[sandstone]]. The northern building is now in better condition. The palaces are notable chiefly for their pediments and lintels, which are in the early [[Angkor Wat]] style.

The next terrace has a small shrine to [[Nandin]] ([[Shiva]]'s mount) to the south, in poor condition. The road connecting Wat Phou to [[Angkor]] ran south from this temple. Continuing west, successive staircases lead up further terraces; between them stands a dvarapala which has come to be worshipped as king [[Kammatha]], mythical builder of the temple. On the narrow next terrace are the remains of six small shrines destroyed by treasure-hunters.

The sanctuary is in two parts. The front section, of sandstone, is now occupied by four [[Buddha]] images, while the brick rear part, which formerly contained the central [[linga]], is empty. The entire roof is missing, although a makeshift covering has been added to the front. Water from the spring which emerges from the cliff about 60 m southwest of the sanctuary was channeled along stone aquaducts into the rear chamber, continuously bathing the linga. The sanctuary is later than the north and south palaces, belonging to the [[Baphuon]] period of the later [[11th century]]. The east side has three doorways: from south to north, their pediments show [[Krishna]] defeating the [[naga (mythology)|naga]] Kaliya; [[Indra]] riding [[Airavata]]; and [[Vishnu]] riding [[Garuda]]. The east wall bears [[dvarapala]]s and [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsaras and devatas|devata]]s. Entrances to the south and north bear have inner and outer [[Architecture of Cambodia#Lintels and pediments|lintel]]s, including one to the south of Krishna ripping [[Kamsa]] apart.

Other features of the area are a [[Architecture of Cambodia#Library|library]], in poor condition, south of the sanctuary, and a relief of the [[Hindu trinity]] to the northwest. There are other carvings further north: a [[Buddha's footprint]] on the cliff-face, and boulders shaped to resemble elephants and a crocodile. The crocodile stone has acquired some notoriety as being possibly the site of an annual [[human sacrifice]] described in a [[6th century]] Chinese text the identification is lent some plausibility by the similarity of the crocodile's dimensions to those of a human.
