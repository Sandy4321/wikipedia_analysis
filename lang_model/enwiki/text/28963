'''Travis Calvin Jackson''' (November 2, 1903&nbsp;<U+2013> July 27, 1987) was an American [[baseball]] [[shortstop]]. In [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), Jackson played for the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] from 1922 through 1936, winning the [[1933 World Series]], and representing the Giants in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star]] in 1934. After his retirement as a player, Jackson [[manager (baseball)|managed]] in [[minor league baseball]] through to the [[1960 in baseball|1960 season]].

Jackson was discovered by [[Kid Elberfeld]] at a [[minor league baseball]] game at the age of 14. Elberfeld signed Jackson to his first professional contract, and recommended him to [[John McGraw]], [[manager (baseball)|manager]] of the Giants. His exceptional range at shortstop led to the nickname "Stonewall."<ref name=terry1934>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CiIbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=c0sEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1819,5614504&dq=travis-jackson&hl=en|title=Giants' Faith in Travis Jackson's Knee Vindicated|first=Chester L. |last=Smith|page=45|date=March 9, 1934|newspaper=[[The Pittsburgh Press]]|accessdate=April 16, 2012}}</ref> After being overlooked by voters for years, Jackson was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1982.

==Early life==
Jackson was born in [[Waldo, Arkansas]] on November 2, 1903. He was the only child of William Jackson, a wholesale grocer, and his wife, Etta, who named their son after [[William B. Travis]], a [[Lieutenant Colonel]] who died at the [[Battle of the Alamo]].<ref name=sabr/> His father bought him a baseball when he was three years old, and they often played catch together.<ref name=sportingnews>{{cite news|title=Travis Jackson Began Tossing a Ball at Age of Three, Playing with Dad&nbsp;<U+2013> and Kept on Until he Became Star|publisher=[[The Sporting News]]|date=June 6, 1930|accessdate=March 30, 2012}}</ref>

Jackson's uncle took him to a game of the [[Little Rock Travelers]], who played [[minor league baseball]] in the Class-A [[Southern Association]], when Jackson was 14 years old. At the game, Jackson's uncle introduced him to [[Kid Elberfeld]], telling Elberfeld that his nephew was a talented baseball player.<ref name=sabr>{{cite web|first=Greg |last=Erion|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/cf84ae81 |title=Travis Jackson |publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]] |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}</ref>  Elberfeld observed Jackson in an impromtu work out, and asked Jackson to contact him when he was ready to begin his professional career.<ref name=sabr/><ref name=sportingnews/>

Jackson attended [[Ouachita Baptist University]] in [[Arkadelphia, Arkansas]], where he starred on the [[college baseball]] team.<ref name=nytobit/> He injured his knee in college, and this injury would recur during Jackson's career.<ref name=nytobit/>

==Professional career==
===Playing career===
Following Jackson's collegiate career, Elberfeld signed Jackson to his first contract, and he played for Little Rock in 1921 and 1922.<ref name=sabr/> Jackson committed 72 [[error (baseball)|errors]] during the 1922 season, which he considered the "world record for errors".<ref name=nytobit/>
