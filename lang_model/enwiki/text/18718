Originally, Urie was not the band's lead singer. Rather, the position had belonged to current guitarist and lyricist, [[Ryan Ross]]. However, when the band heard him sing backup during a rehearsal, they were impressed with his vocal abilities and unanimously decided to make him the singer.<ref>{{cite web

After graduation, Urie's parents strongly encouraged him to attend college, but against their wishes he chose to pursue his interests in music and helped get [[Panic! at the Disco]] off the ground. Urie was later asked to leave his home by his disapproving parents upon deciding to pursue Panic!, and was forced to rent a one room apartment with only his job at a local Smoothie Hut to support himself, as well as help pay for the rent of the band's practice space.<ref>{{cite web

In order to promote their music, the band contacted [[Fall Out Boy]] bassist [[Pete Wentz]], through [[LiveJournal]], and sent him a link to their [[PureVolume]] site along with their two recorded songs, "[[Time to Dance]]" and "[[Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks]]". Wentz was so impressed that he took a trip to Las Vegas to meet the band in person. After seeing them play in their garage, he asked if they would sign with his [[Fueled by Ramen]] imprint label [[Decaydance]].

After traveling through Vegas, [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], and [[Los Angeles]] playing live shows, the band eventually released their first album in [[September]] of [[2005]], entitled [[A Fever You Can't Sweat Out]]. The debut album reached #13 on the [[Billboard 200|US Billboard 200]] charts and sold over one million copies since its release. Five singles were released from the album, the highest charting one being "[[I Write Sins Not Tragedies]]" at #7 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|USA Hot 100]]. The album has since become one of the biggest selling records ever to be released on an independent label and has since earned Panic! major cult success. 

During a live show after the release of A Fever..., [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] reported that Urie was singing the single, "[[Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off]]", when an incident that usually goes as planned went astray. Urie sang the verse, "Have you ever dreamt you were in a sunflower field," and then with some minor variations describes running toward a lover for "the perfect kiss." As he did this, he approached guitarist Ryan Ross and leaned down to his face, who usually pulls his mouth away just in time to miss a kiss from Urie. But in San Diego on a show, on the final night of a tour, Urie moved in quick enough to plant a kiss on Ross' cheek, whom immediately blushed with embarrassment. Then, as Urie pulled back, the room filled with a gasp. Urie was reported to say, "Well, this isn't that kind of dream. This is about sweaty, angry, crazy, monstrous fucking." Young girls in the crowd at the show were reported to scream for Urie after he spoke to the crowd. [http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/panic_at_the_disco_high_school_musical/page/2]

Urie was recently seen sporting a [[tattoo]] of [[piano]] keys on his left forearm, around the time of his 20th birthday.
