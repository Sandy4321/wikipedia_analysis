===Garnaut Climate Change Review===
{{Main|Garnaut Climate Change Review}}
The Garnaut Climate Change Review was commissioned by former [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[Kevin Rudd]],<ref>http://www.garnautreview.org.au/CA25734E0016A131/WebObj/GarnautClimateChangeReview-DraftReport-Ch1andPrelim/$File/Garnaut%20Climate%20Change%20Review%20-%20Draft%20Report%20-%20Ch%201%20and%20Prelim.pdf</ref> and by the [[Australia|Australia's]] [[States and Territories of Australia|state and territory]] governments on 30 April 2007. After his election on 24 November 2007 the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[Kevin Rudd]], confirmed the participation of the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]] in the review.

The final report was released on 30 September 2008<ref>[http://www.garnautreport.org.au/ Garnaut report homepage]</ref> and recommended that Australia push internationally for a carbon dioxide equivalent concentrations of 450 [[ppm]], which would commit Australia to reductions of 25% on 2000 levels by 2020 and 90% by 2050.

The report's recommendations in terms of policy, apart from a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme which included forestry and agriculture, centred heavily on hoping that [[carbon capture and storage]] and other [[clean coal]] technologies would be available on a wide-scale within the next twenty years.

The report was criticised by the [[Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry]] for the economic impact that reducing greenhouse gas emissions would have.<ref>http://www.acci.asn.au/text_files/media_releases/2008/101-08.pdf</ref> It was also heavily criticised by environmental organisations, including [[Friends of the Earth]]<ref>http://www.foe.org.au/media-releases/2008-media-releases/rudd-must-reject-garnauts-low-climate-change-targets</ref> and [[Rising Tide]].<ref>http://www.risingtide.org.au/node/792</ref> The [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] praised the report for advocating a 450 ppm target.<ref>http://www.acfonline.org.au/articles/news.asp?news_id=1973</ref> Dr. [[Clive Hamilton]] was heavily critical of the report, arguing that it reduced global expectations of what should be aimed for, naively exposed Australia's negotiating tactics to the international diplomatic sphere, alienates both the Australian public and the international community, misjudges the time frames necessary to avoid dangerous climate change, gives Australia numerous special deals, and would be rejected by the international community.<ref>http://www.crikey.com.au/Garnaut-Report/20080930-Clive-Hamilton-politics-trumps-science-in-Garnaut-report.html</ref>

Responses from political parties were mixed. [[Australian Greens]] leader [[Bob Brown]] showed that the report demonstrated that reducing greenhouse gas emissions would not come at the expense of Australia's economic growth.<ref>http://greens.org.au/node/3216</ref> Climate Change Minister [[Penny Wong]] did not comment directly on the report but said that economic responsibility needed to be considered in responding to the report, and that the Government would wait before [[Department of the Treasury (Australia)|Treasury]] modelling on climate change mitigation before responding.<ref>http://news.smh.com.au/national/climate-policy-must-be-responsible-wong-20080930-4qio.html</ref>
