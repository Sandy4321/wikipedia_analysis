'''Nestorius''' (in [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''<U+039D><U+03B5><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03CC><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2>''; ''c.'' 386&ndash;''c.'' 451) was [[Patriarch of Constantinople|Archbishop of Constantinople]] from [[10 April]] [[428]] to [[22 June]] [[431]].  He was accused by his political enemy [[Cyril of Alexandria]] of a [[heresy]] that later bore his name, [[Nestorianism]], because he objected to the popular practice of calling [[the Virgin Mary]] the "Mother of God" [[theotokos]]; he instead preached that "Mother of Christ" would be more fitting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nestorian.org/nestorius.html|title=Nestorius biography and Nestorianism|accessdate=3 August|accessyear=2008}}</ref>  He was condemned at the [[Council of Ephesus]] before his supporters could arrive and he was then dethroned.  His views were widely held in the East, and the consequence was the creation of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], over the Persian border and hence beyond Greek political control.

==Early life==

Nestorius was born in 386 in [[Germanicia]] in the [[Syria (Roman province)|Roman province of Syria]] (now [[Kahramanmara<U+015F>]] in Turkey).<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9055341/Nestorius Nestorius - Britannica Online Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He received his clerical training as a pupil of [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] in [[Antioch]] and gained a reputation for his sermons that led to his enthronement by [[Theodosius II]] as Archbishop following the death of [[Archbishop Sisinnius I of Constantinople|Sisinnius I]] in 428.

==Controversy with Cyril==

Nestorius is considered the originator of the [[Christology|Christological]] position known as [[Nestorianism]], which was eventually declared [[Heresy|heretical]] by the [[Council of Ephesus]]; it emerged when he began preaching against the title [[Theotokos]] (in [[Greek language|Greek]], <U+0398><U+03B5><U+03BF><U+03C4><U+03CC><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C2>) or ''Mother of God'', ''God-Bearer'', an appellation for [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]]. He quickly met with antagonism from the bishop, Saint [[Cyril of Alexandria]].  Alongside the Christological debate, other factors were to come into play in the controversy that would ensue, including a political struggle between the supporters of the See of Alexandria and the See of Antioch, the influence of the Emperor over the See of Constantinople, and the patriarchal primacy of the Pope.

The theological debate centered on the use of the title "Mother of God" (''[[Theotokos]]/<U+0398><U+03B5><U+03BF><U+03C4><U+03CC><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C2>'') for [[the Virgin Mary]], which Nestorius did not recognize, preferring in his sermons, "Mother of Christ" (''Christotokos/<U+03A7><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C4><U+03CC><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C2>''/) on the grounds that the former title compromised [[Jesus]]' humanity. Cyril countered that it was Nestorius who was actually denying the reality of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], by making Jesus Christ into two different persons, one human and one divine, in one body. ''See [[Nestorianism]].''

The Emperor [[Theodosius II]] (401&ndash;450) was eventually induced to convoke a general church council, sited at Ephesus, itself a special seat for the veneration of Mary, where the ''theotokos'' formula was popular.  The Emperor gave his support to the Archbishop of Constantinople, while [[Pope Celestine I]] was in agreement with Cyril.

[[Cyril_of_Alexandria|Cyril]] took charge of the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431, opening debate before the long-overdue contingent of Eastern bishops from [[Antioch]] could arrive. 

The council deposed Nestorius and declared him a [[heresy|heretic]]. In Nestorius' own words,

<blockquote>When the followers of [[Cyril_of_Alexandria|Cyril]] saw the vehemence of the emperor<U+2026> they roused up a disturbance and discord among the people with an outcry, as though the emperor were opposed to God; they rose up against the nobles and the chiefs who acquiesced not in what had been done by them and they were running hither and thither. And<U+2026> they took with them those who had been separated and removed from the monasteries by reason of their lives and their strange manners and had for this reason been expelled, and all who were of heretical sects and were possessed with fanaticism and with hatred against me. And one passion was in them all, Jews and pagans and all the sects, and they were busying themselves that they should accept without examination the things which were done without examination against me; and at the same time all of them, even those that had participated with me at table and in prayer and in thought, were agreed<U+2026> against me and vowing vows one with another against me<U+2026> In nothing were they divided.</blockquote>

But while the council was in progress, [[John I of Antioch]] and the eastern bishops arrived, and were furious to hear that Nestorius had already been condemned.  They convened their own synod, at which [[Cyril_of_Alexandria|Cyril]] was deposed.

Both sides then appealed to the emperor, or rather to the imperial eunuchs who controlled him.  Initially the imperial government ordered both Nestorius and [[Cyril_of_Alexandria|Cyril]] deposed and exiled.  Letter 96 of [[Cyril_of_Alexandria|Cyril]]'s ''Letters'' contains a list of the bribes that he offered to various courtiers; and [[Cyril_of_Alexandria|Cyril]] was allowed to return. - (Citation Needed)

In the following months, 17 [[bishop]]s who supported Nestorius' doctrine were removed from their sees. Eventually the political position became so bad that [[John I of Antioch]] was obliged to abandon Nestorius in March 433. On August 3, 435, [[Theodosius II]], who had supported Nestorius' appointment, bowed to the influence of his sister [[Pulcheria]] in issuing an imperial edict that exiled Nestorius to a [[monastery]] in the Great Oasis of Hibis ([[Kharga Oasis|al-Khargah]]), in Egypt, securely within the diocese of [[Cyril_of_Alexandria|Cyril]]. There he was at risk of attack by desert bandits, and was injured in one such raid.

In East and West, Nestorius' writings were burnt wherever they could be found. They survive mainly in [[Syriac]].

The incident caused a split within the church, and led to the creation of separate [[Nestorianism|Nestorian churches]] that would flourish throughout the [[Middle East]] and [[central Asia]].

After 1,500 years of stigmatization as a heretic, a handwritten 16th century book containing a copy of a text written by Nestorius was discovered by American missionaries in 1895, in the library of the Nestorian patriarch in the mountains at Kotchanes.  This book had suffered damage during Moslem raids, but was substantially intact, and copies were taken secretly.  The Syriac translation had the title of the [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers#Nestorius ''Bazaar of Heracleides'']. The original 16th century manuscript was destroyed in 1915 during the Turkish massacres of Nestorian Christians.

The ''Bazaar'' was written towards the end of his life, and in it he explicitly denies the heresy for which he was condemned. Instead he affirms of Christ "the same one is twofold" &mdash; an expression that some consider similar to the formulation of the [[Council of Chalcedon]]. Nestorius's earlier surviving writings, however, including his letter written in response to [[Cyril_of_Alexandria|Cyril]]'s charges against him, contain material that seems to support charges that he held that Christ had two persons. Thus, whether Nestorius was actually a Nestorian is still a matter of debate.

Nestorius is deeply venerated in the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] as a [[saint]], the Syriac for 'Saint Nestorius' being ''Mar Nestorios''.
