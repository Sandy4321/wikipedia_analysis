'''Jean Thurel''' (or '''Jean Theurel''') (8 September 1699{{ndash}}10 March 1807) was a [[fusilier]] of the [[French Army]] with an extraordinarily long career that spanned over 90 years of service. Having been born during the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and died during that of [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], Thurel lived in three different centuries and served three different monarchs.

==Military career==
Thurel  was born in [[Orain]], [[Burgundy]]. He enlisted on 17 September 1716 in the ''[[Touraine Regiment|R<U+00E9>giment de Touraine]]'', at the age of 17.<ref name=Sabretache1895>{{cite book|author=La Sabretache (societe d'etudes d'histoire militaire)|title=Carnet de la Sabretache: revue militaire r<U+00E9>trospective|volume=III|chapter=Le m<U+00E9>daillon de v<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>rance|pages=264-73|year=1895|language=French|publisher=Berger-Levrault et Cie|location=Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Lorraine, France|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SlrQAAAAMAAJ&q=thurel#v=snippet&q=thurel&f=false|accessdate=2011-07-04}}
</ref> He served there for over 90 years without interruption, under [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], the [[French First Republic|Republic]] and the [[First French Empire|Empire]].<ref name=Brown1808>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Charles Brockden|authorlink1=Charles Brockden Brown|last2=Walsh|first2=Robert|authorlink2=Robert Walsh (diplomat)|title=The American register: or general repository of history, politics and science. Part II for 1807|volume=II|chapter=Foreign literary and philosophical intelligence|page=408|year=1808|publisher=C & A. Conrad and Company|location=Philadelphia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SlrQAAAAMAAJ&q=thurel#v=snippet&q=thurel&f=false}}</ref>

Thurel was severely wounded in battle on two occasions. In 1733, during the [[Siege of Kehl (1733)|siege of Kehl]], he was shot in the neck with a [[musket]]. At the [[battle of Minden]] in 1759, he received seven sword slashes, including six to the head. Three of his brothers were killed in the [[battle of Fontenoy]] in 1745. One of Thurel's sons was a [[corporal]] in the same [[Company (military unit)|company]]. He died at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], a naval battle that occurred on 12 April 1782 off the coast of [[Dominica]], [[Caribbean|West Indies]] during the [[France in the American Revolutionary War|American campaign]].<ref name=Sabretache1895/>

A well-disciplined soldier of the [[line infantry]], Thurel was only [[admonition|admonished]] once during his entire career. This occurred after the [[Siege of Bergen op Zoom (1747)|Siege of Bergen]], which took place in 1747, during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], as the French troops occupied the [[citadel]]. The reason for his admonition was that, the doors of the [[fortification|fortress]] being shut, he scaled its walls to gain entry so that he would not miss [[Muster (military)|muster]]. Another example of Thurel's discipline and physical fitness occurred in 1787. When his regiment was ordered to march to the coast to embark on ships of the [[French_Navy#18th_century|French Navy]], he was given the opportunity to travel in a carriage due to his advanced age. The 88-year-old Thurel refused the offer and marched the entire distance on foot, stating that he had never before traveled by carriage and had no intention of doing so at that time.<ref name=Brown1808/> His humility is evident in his steadfast refusal to accept any promotions; he remained a low-ranking fusilier for his entire military career.<ref name=Moniteur1801>{{cite news|author=|title=n<U+00B0>329, 29 thermidor an IX|pages=|newspaper=[[Le Moniteur Universel|Gazette Nationale ou Le Moniteur Universal]]|publisher=[[Charles-Joseph Panckoucke]]|location=Paris|date=17 August 1801|language=French}}</ref>

==Honors and awards==
[[File:Legion-dHonneur-IMG 0947.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Legion of Honour|L<U+00E9>gion d'Honneur]]'' medal, similar to the one that [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] awarded to Thurel. This one, dated 1870, is from the [[French Third Republic]].]]

On 8 November 1787, Thurel was presented to the royal family, and Louis XVI granted him an annual pension of 300 [[French_livre#Eighteenth_century|livres]].<ref name=Brown1808/>

[[Ranks_in_the_French_Army#Militaires_du_rang_-_Enlisted|Enlisted men]] and [[Ranks_in_the_French_Army#Sous-officiers_-_Sub-officers|non-commissioned officers]] were not eligible to receive the ''[[Order of Saint Louis|Ordre Royal et Militaire de Saint-Louis]]'' (Royal and Military Order of Saint Louis), which was reserved for [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]]s of the Army or the Navy.<ref name=Mazas1850>{{cite book|last1=Mazas|first1=A|last2=Anne|first2=T|title=Histoire de l'ordre royal & militaire de Saint Louis, depuis son institution en 1693 jusqu'en 1830|chapter=|pages=|publisher=|location=|year=1860|language=French|url=http://www.memodoc.com/article_ordre_st_louis.htm}}</ref> In hopes of improving re-enlistment rates, Louis XV established the ''M<U+00E9>daillon des deux <U+00E9>p<U+00E9>es'' (Medal of the Two Swords) by a royal [[decree]] in 1771. This was the first [[Military awards and decorations of France|military decoration]] in France for which an enlisted man could be eligible. This medal was awarded to soldiers who had served in the French Army, as a reward for their longevity of service. The decree was extended in 1774 so that sailors of the French Navy were also eligible to receive the medal. A soldier or sailor would have to serve for 24 years in order to be eligible for the ''M<U+00E9>daillon des deux <U+00E9>pe<U+00E9>s''.<ref name=Champenois2011>{{cite web|last=Champenois|first=Marc|title=M<U+00E9>daillon Des Deux <U+00C9>p<U+00E9>es|work=Les D<U+00E9>corations|publisher=France Phaleristique: Le site des ordres, d<U+00E9>corations et m<U+00E9>dailles officielles de France|location=|year=2011|language=French|url=http://www.france-phaleristique.com/deuxepees.htm|accessdate=2011-07-04}}</ref>

Thurel was awarded two ''M<U+00E9>daillons des deux <U+00E9>p<U+00E9>es'' in 1771, the year the medal was established, in recognition of the two 24-year periods of time during which he had served up until then. He was awarded a third medal in 1788, in recognition of the period from 1764{{ndash}}1788. Very few men have completed the 48 years of military service required to receive a second medal. Thurel is the only one ever to have received it three times.<ref name=Champenois2011/>

On 26 October 1804, at the age of 105, Thurel became one of the first recipients of the newly established ''[[Legion of Honour|l' Ordre National de la Legion d'Honneur]]'' (National Order of the Legion of Honor), the highest decoration in France.<ref name=Sabretache1895/> Napoleon also rewarded him with a pension of 1,200 [[franc]]s. He was later appointed as the "oldest soldier of Europe". He remained healthy in body and spirit throughout his remarkably long life. He died in [[Tours]] on 10 March 1807, at the age of 107, after a brief illness.<ref name=Brown1808/>
