'''Miroslav "Mi<U+0148>o" Stoch''' (born 19 October 1989 in [[Nitra]], [[Slovakia]]) is a Slovakian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who currently plays as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] for Dutch [[Eredivisie]] club [[FC Twente]] on loan from English [[Premier League]] side [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Stoch is known for his incisive runs, crossing ability, and one-on-one finishing with the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]].

==Early life and career==
As a child he was rarely seen without a football. His father realized his talent at an early age and placed him with his local club's academy [[FC Nitra]]. Mi<U+0148>o, as his family calls him, developed his goal-scoring abilities by arriving on the training pitch earlier than his teammates and practicing his shooting.

===FC Nitra===
His hard work paid off as he was drafted into Nitra's first team after scoring a hat-trick in an under-17 match, though he was only 15 at the time, and, due to age restrictions in the Slovakian league, he could not play until his 16th birthday. He made his first-team debut at the age of 16 and by this time he was already being watched by European scouts.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/Under17/news/Kind=1/newsId=406368.html|title=Poles enjoying home comforts|accessdate=11 October 2007|date=11 October 2007 |work= |publisher=[[UEFA|Uefa.com]]}}</ref>

===Chelsea===
Chelsea had scouts in one of the international competitions he played in and offered him a trial around the same time that [[OGC Nice]] was about to sign him. He duly impressed and was signed by Chelsea's youth academy in 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.fcnitra.sk/index.php?page=clanok&id=15|title=Stoch podp<U+00ED>sal zmluvu s Chelsea Lond<U+00FD>n|accessdate=11 October 2007 |date=11 October 2007 |work= |publisher=fcnitra.sk}}</ref> He was a regular for the Under-18s in the 2006<U+2013>07 season and scored 11 goals. He ended the season as top scorer for the under-18s even though he had always played on the wing. He started the 2007<U+2013>08 season well and quickly progressed to the reserve team. Stoch bases his game on his two footballing idols&mdash;[[Ronaldinho]] and [[Ronaldo]]&mdash;and tries to emulate them on the pitch.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.miroslavstoch.sk/en/index.php?id=profile|title=Profile|accessdate= 11 October 2007 |date= 11 October 2007 |work= |publisher=miroslavstoch.sk}}</ref> 

Stoch himself stated that he was close to making his first-team debut and hoped to do so during the course of the [[2007-08 in English football|2007<U+2013>08 season]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_2758981,00.html|title=Starlet patient at Blues|accessdate=27 September 2007 |date=27 September 2007|publisher=SkySports.com}}</ref> although he did not.  Stoch finally made his first appearance as a substitute on 30 November 2008 against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at Stamford Bridge. He replaced [[Deco]] after 80 minutes. Chelsea lost the game 1-2. Stoch made his second appearance for the first-team, replacing [[Jon Obi Mikel]] in the 82nd minute, in Chelsea's 2-1 comeback win over [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], playing a major part in the lead up to Chelsea's second goal. Stoch came on for [[Jon Obi Mikel]] against {{fc|Watford}} in the [[FA Cup]] fifth round with Chelsea 1-0 down with 20 minutes. The game finished 3-1 to Chelsea with Stoch playing a fairly major role as he won the corner which led to the equalising goal from [[Nicolas Anelka]].

===FC Twente===
On 16 July 2009 [[FC Twente]] signed Stoch on loan from [[Chelsea F.C.]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fctwente.nl/nieuws/index.php?item=8697|title=FC Twente huurt talenten|publisher=fctwente.nl|language=Dutch}}</ref>. Stoch made his first [[Eredivisie]] appearance against [[Sparta Rotterdam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/overseas/holland/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/09/09/12/SOCCER_FC_Twente_Nightlead.html&TEAMHD=holland | title =  Twente move to Second | publisher = sportinglife.com | accessdate = 6 November 2009}}</ref> He scored both goals in the 2-0 win over [[SC Heerenveen]] on 20 September.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nu.nl/sport/2085874/heerenveen-niet-opgewassen-stoch.html | title =  Heerenveen niet opgewassen tegen Stoch | language = Dutch | date = 20 September 2009| accessdate = 6 November 2009 | publisher = nu.nl}}</ref> Stoch than scored an impressive opening goal, a scorcher from distance, in the 4-0 win against [[FC Groningen]] on 25 October. Stoch continued his impressive scoring record for Twente by scoring and getting an assist in the 2-1 win over [[Roda JC]] on the 31 October.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.voetbalfan.nl/pagina/voorpagina/41890/twente-verslaat-onmachtig-groningen | title = Twente verslaat onmachtig Groningen | language = Dutch | date = 25 October 2009| accessdate = 6 November 2009 | publisher = voetbalfan.nl}}</ref> In Twente's latest league game against [[NAC Breda]] (Which Twente won 3-1), Stoch scored two goals to propel the team to victory, after Twente fell behind by a goal.

==International career==
Stoch made his senior d<U+00E9>but for [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]] on 10 February 2009 against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], where he came on in the 70th minute.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ukrainiansoccer.net/?controller=publication&action=item&id=78507|title=Slovakia 2-3 Ukraine|accessdate=14 February 2009  |date=10 February 2009 |work= |publisher=ukrainiansoccer.net}}</ref> His second appearance came just 24 hours later against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]]. He scored his first international goal for Slovakia against [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 World Cup Qualification]] match on  6 June 2009.
