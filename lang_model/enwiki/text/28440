"'''The Devil Went Down to Georgia'''" is a song written and performed by the [[Charlie Daniels|Charlie Daniels Band]] and released on their 1979<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=A9uanqjobojha "Million Mile Reflections."]  ''Allmusic''.</ref> album ''[[Million Mile Reflections]]''.

The song is written in the key of [[D minor]]. [[Vassar Clements]] originally wrote the basic [[melody]] an [[octave]] lower, in a tune called "Lonesome Fiddle Blues". The Charlie Daniels Band moved it up an octave and put words to it. The song's verses are closer to being spoken rather than sung (i.e. [[chant]] or [[Sprechstimme]]), and tell the story of a boy named Johnny, who one day is challenged by [[the devil]] to a battle of fiddle-playing: If Johnny triumphs, he claims a golden fiddle; losing the battle will forfeit his soul. The performances of [[Satan]] and Johnny are played as instrumental bridges.

The song was the band's biggest pop hit, reaching number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].<ref>Whitburn, Joel: "The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits", p. 92, ISBN 0-8230-7518-4</ref> The song was featured in the movie ''[[Urban Cowboy]]''. The choreographer of the film, Patsy Swayze, claims that she set the tempo to the song. "How fast can you dance it?" Daniels asked. "How fast can you play it?" Swayze replied.

==Content==
The song is a narrative about the [[Devil]], who comes to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to procure [[soul]]s. He has not obtained any recently, and is willing to "make a deal" (hence the opening lines "The devil went down to Georgia/he was lookin' for a soul to steal/he was in a bind, 'cause he was way behind, and he was willin' to make a deal") out of desperation. He happens upon a young [[fiddle]] player named Johnny, who is minding his own business and playing impressively. The Devil approaches Johnny, and informs him that he, too, plays the fiddle. He then challenges Johnny to a fiddle-playing contest, confident that he is more skillful than the young boy. The terms of the duel are that should Johnny win, he will be given a fiddle made of solid [[gold]], but should the Devil triumph, he gains Johnny's soul. Although he fears that taking the Devil's bet might be sinful, Johnny accepts the terms, proudly telling the Devil that the Devil will regret it as Johnny is "the best there's ever been". The duel commences, with the Devil performing a sinister and powerful piece with the backing of [[demon]] musicians. Despite this, the Devil is squarely defeated when Johnny takes his turn to perform (afterwards, Johnny said, "I done told you once, you son-of-a-bitch ["son-of-a-gun" in some more recent renditions], I'm the best there's ever been!"). The Devil acknowledges being bested and, true to his word, the Devil presents Johnny with a beautiful golden fiddle. Johnny boastfully informs the Devil that he is welcome anytime to come back for a rematch.

==Musical references==
The narrative is a derivative of the traditional [[pact with the Devil]] motif. Charlie Daniels has stated in interviews, "I don<U+2019>t know where it came from, but it just did. Well, I think I might know where it came from, it may have come from an old poem called 'The Mountain Whippoorwill' that [[Stephen Vincent Ben<U+00E9>t]] wrote many, many years ago [[1925]], that I had in high school. Either that or Jersey."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/int/2007/05/charlie-daniels.html|title=www.songfacts.com/int/2007/05/charlie-daniels.html<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref>

Johnny's song itself is an amalgamation of traditional tunes:
* ''Fire on the mountain, run boys run''- from ''[[Fire on the Mountain]]'', a bluegrass fiddle tune dating to at least the early 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/bluegrass-songbook/003470.HTM|title=www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/bluegrass-songbook/003470.HTM<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref>
* ''The devil's in the house of the rising sun''- reference to ''[[The House of the Rising Sun]]'', an American folk song
* ''Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough/Granny does your dog bite? No, child no''- from [[Bob Wills]]' version of ''[[Ida Red]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/lyrics/wills_bob/ida_red/13213895/lyrics.jhtml|title=www.mtv.com/lyrics/wills_bob/ida_red/13213895/lyrics.jhtml<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref>

==In the media==
Daniels' song was popular in [[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]], in which the song was for the guitar battle between the player and the devil, as said in the song. The song was also covered by [[Primus (band) | Primus]]. The song was sampled in Shrek 2 the videogame as well, as music for the tomato race to get a pail of water at the top of the hill. The song was sampled in [[The Waterboy]]. It was parodied by [[Cledus T. Judd]] as "Cledus Went Down to Florida". It was also covered by the [[Zac Brown Band]] live at the 2009 CMA Awards. An episode of season 3 of the [[Cartoon Network]] [[Adult Swim]] series ''[[Squidbillies]]'' (focusing on a character selling his soul to Satan for [[guitar]] skills, similar to the song's plot) was titled "[[Mephistopheles]] Traveled Below to a [[Southern United States|Southern State]] Whose Motto is Wisdom, Justice and Moderation" (the Georgia [[state motto]]). The song was featured in the [[New Zealand]] film [[Stickmen (film)|''Stickmen'']], where  one of the characters previously mentioned that it was one of his favourite songs. The story narrated in the song was referenced in the episode ''[[Hell Is Other Robots]]'' of animated science fiction comedic cartoon ''[[Futurama]]''.

==Music video==
A live music video was released in September 1979. It was directed by Corlew & Grimes.

==Sequel==
{{anchor|[[The Devil Comes Back to Georgia]]}}A sequel to the song, titled "The Devil Comes Back to Georgia," was recorded by Daniels and fiddle player [[Mark O'Connor]] in 1993, featuring guest performances by [[Travis Tritt]] (as the devil), [[Marty Stuart]] (as Johnny) and [[Johnny Cash]] as the narrator. In the sequel, Johnny has grown into a man, who is married and has a child. Hoping to take advantage of Johnny's [[Hubris|sinful pride]], the Devil challenges him to a rematch. The Devil snatches the Golden Fiddle from Johnny, and demands that he practice with his old fiddle to play against him. The ending does not state the victor outright, though the music video suggests Johnny won, as does the line "Johnny's still the best that's ever been". The song can be found on Mark O'Connor's album, [[Heroes (1993 album)|''Heroes'']].
