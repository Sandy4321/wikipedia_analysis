An invite to Canada's selection camp for the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]] helped Iginla emerge into a star player.

==Playing style==
Iginla is considered to be one of the pre-eminent [[Power forward (ice hockey)|power forwards]] in the game today.<ref>{{cite web |last=Nichols |first=Chris |url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/2008/09/18/nichols_power_forwards/ |title=NHL Power Brokers |publisher=Rogers Sportsnet |date=2008-09-18 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref>  Entering the league, Iginla tried to emulate players like [[Brendan Shanahan]] and [[Keith Tkachuk]], hoping to match their combination of finesse and physicality.<ref name="Impact" />  He is not afraid to fight,<ref name="fighting">{{cite web |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081015.WBhockeyblog20081015171724/WBStory/WBhockeyblog |title=Why is Iginla fighting? |work=Globe and Mail |date=2008-10-15 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref> having recorded several [[Gordie Howe hat trick]]s (a goal, an assist and a fight in the same game) during his career.<ref name="0809MediaGuide" />  Iginla says he does not go looking for fights, but doesn't back down when the situation requires it.<ref name="fighting" /> 

"You've got a power forward who does it all," said teammate [[Craig Conroy]]. "I mean, he'll fight, and hit, and score goals.  Maybe it's not the end-to-end rushes, but he does all those little things that win games and get things done."<ref>{{cite web |last=Hall |first=Vicki |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/sports/story.html?id=717c5c54-855e-42cd-9d43-d02fba8080bc |title=Avery takes jab at Iginla |work=Calgary Herald |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref>

He is well known for his kind-hearted nature.  Former Flames general manager [[Craig Button]] described Iginla as being grounded: "he doesn't carry himself with any attitude or arrogance. He's confident in his abilities. He's self-assured. He's genuine. He's a better person than he is a player, and we all know what kind of player he is."<ref>{{cite web |last=Ross |first=Sherry |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2002/10/06/2002-10-06_fanning_the_flames__jarome_i.html |title=Jarome Iginla becoming hottest ticket in Canada |work=New York Daily News |date=2002-10-06 |accessdate=2009-01-02}}</ref>  In 2002, while in [[Salt Lake City]] for the [[2002 Winter Olympic Games]], Iginla struck up a conversation with four Calgarians sitting next to his table, and found out they were sleeping in their car outside of the hotel.
