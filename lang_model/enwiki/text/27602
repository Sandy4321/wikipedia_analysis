'''Alvin Cushman Graves''' (November 4, 1909 <U+2013> July 19, 1965) was a [[nuclear physicist]] who served at the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] and the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] during [[World War II]]. After the war, he became the head of J (Test) Division at Los Alamos, and was director or assistant director of numerous [[nuclear weapons test]]s during the 1940s and 1950s.

==Early life==
Alvin Cushman Graves was born on November 4, 1909 in [[Washington, DC]],<ref name="FG" >{{Find a Grave | grid       = 6602447 | name       = Alvin Cushman Graves | date= July 19, 1965 | accessdate = October 11, 2014  }}</ref> the youngest of six children. He was the son of Herbert C. Graves, and engineer with the [[Coast and Geodetic Survey]], and a member of the [[American Commission to Negotiate Peace]] after [[World War I]]. Graves attended [[Eastern High School (Washington, D.C.)|Eastern High School]], and graduated at the top of his class from the [[University of Virginia]] in 1931 with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. He attended the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] for a year, but found that jobs were hard to come by during the [[Great Depression]]. He received a graduate fellowship to the [[University of Chicago]], where he earned his [[Ph.D.]],  writing his thesis on "Packing Fraction Differences Among Heavy Elements".<ref name="Post">{{cite news |last=Becker |first=Bill |title=The Man Who Sets Off Atomic Bombs |newspaper=[[The Saturday Evening Post]] |date=April 19, 1952| pages=32<U+2013>33, 185<U+2013>188 |accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title = Packing Fraction Differences Among Heavy Elements |last=Graves |first=Alvin C. |journal=[[Physical Review]]  |volume = 55 |issue = 9 |pages = 863<U+2013>867 |year = 1939 |month = May |publisher = [[American Physical Society]] |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.55.863}}</ref>

At Chicago, Graves met and married Elizabeth Riddle, a physics major there,<ref name="Post"/> who was known as "Diz".<ref name="Sun"/> She earned her own Ph.D., writing her thesis on "Energy Release from Beryllium-9 (Alpha, Alpha) Lithium-7 and the Production of Lithium-7".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://phdtree.org/scholar/graves-elizabeth-riddle/publication/ |publisher=PhD Tree |title=Publications of Elizabeth Riddle Graves |accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> Graves remained at the University of Chicago as a research fellow and an assistant professor until 1939, when he moved to the [[University of Texas]].<ref name="Post"/> Unfortunately, Elizabeth was unable to secure a job there as well due to its nepotism rules.<ref name="Sun"/>

==Manhattan Project==
In 1942 Graves  was invited back to the University of Chicago by [[Arthur H. Compton]]. Graves had already received a request from the [[MIT Radiation Laboratory]] to work on [[radar]], and he asked if he could contribute more to Compton's project. Compton replied that he would.<ref name="Post"/> He joined the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Metallurgical Laboratory]], and helped build the first nuclear reactor, the [[Chicago Pile-1]].<ref name=fal /> He was a member of Fermi's "suicide squad", assigned to drop buckets of liquid cadmium salts onto the reactor if something went wrong.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/cp1-pioneers/ |title=The Chicago Pile 1 Pioneers |publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]] |accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref>

Graves and Elizabeth, moved to work at [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in New Mexico when it opened in 1943.<ref name=fal>{{harvnb|Fradkin|1989|pp=89<U+2013>90}}</ref> He made it a condition of his going to Los Alamos that a job be found there for her. This was probably unnecessary, as someone with her skills<U+2014>she was one of the few physicists who had experience with a [[Cockcroft-Walton accelerator]]<U+2014>would have been quickly snapped up at Los Alamos.<ref name="Sun"/>

At the time of the [[Trinity nuclear test]] in 1945, Elizabeth was seven month pregnant with her first child. Graves therefore request that they be assigned to a post far from the blast. They listened to [[Samuel K. Allison]]'s countdown to the explosion on the radio, and monitored the [[radioactive fallout]] from the test, which took until the afternoon to reach them, with [[Geiger counter]]s.<ref name="Sun"/> 
The child was a healthy daughter Marilyn Edith.<ref name="Post"/>

Graves was badly injured in a [[demon core#Second incident|1946 laboratory criticality accident]] in Los Alamos that killed Dr. [[Louis Slotin]]. Slotin, who was training Graves to replace him in his position as chief bomb assembler for Los Alamos, was demonstrating the dangerous "tickling the dragon's tail" test to several other scientists when the accident occurred. Graves, who was looking over Slotin's shoulder, suffered an estimated 400 roentgen dose (by the rough knowledge of the time 500 roentgens was the amount which would kill half of the recipients).  This caused severe radiation poisoning, loss of hair and a zero semen count, two weeks of  hospitalization and a several week convalescence.  He seemed to have recovered fully in a few months, work and skiing vigorously, with only a bald spot on the head to show for the experience. Two years later he fathered a healthy child, their second,<ref name=fal /><ref name=hempelman>{{cite conference|last=Hempelman|first=Louis Henry|last2=Lushbaugh |first2=Clarence C. |last3=Voelz |first3=George L.|title=What Has Happened to the Survivors of the Early Los Alamos Nuclear Accidents?|conference=Conference for Radiation Accident Preparedness|date=October 19, 1979|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/pdf/accidentsurvivorslanl.pdf|accessdate=January 5, 2013|publisher=[[Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]]|location=Oak Ridge|id=LA-UR-79-2802}} Dr. Graves is identified in this paper as "Case 4".</ref> a son they named Alvin Palmer.<ref name="Post"/>

==Later life==
Graves became dismissive of the radiation risks from nuclear testing; while serving as test director for the Nevada Test Site shots during the 1950s. He announced that the risks from fallout were "concocted in the minds of weak malingerers."<ref name=fal /> As a spokesman for the [[Nevada Test Site]], he would speak in local areas around Nevada assuring the population of no danger from the activities there.  As the head of the Los Alamos Laboratory's J (Test) Division,<ref name=fal /> he was the scientific director or deputy director of most of the Atomic tests from 1948 through the 1950s, including the [[Desert Rock exercises]] which exposed military personnel to radiation, and the [[Castle Bravo]] test that irradiated many native islanders and test personnel.<ref name="Post" /><ref name=fal /> Asked to testify before the [[Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]] on the danger of radiation causing [[cancer]], Graves replied:{{quote|The danger is not that this will happen to you. The danger is that it is more likely to happen to you. maybe the more likely is not very much more likely, but it is still more likely.<ref name=fal />}}

Graves was a pillar of the Los Alamos community. He was an active member of the non-denominational Protestant Community Church. With the encouragement of Elizabeth, who played the violin, he learned to play the [[cello]],<ref name="Post"/> hoarding his petrol ration stamps so that he could travel to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], for lessons.<ref name="Sun">{{harvnb|Howes|Herzenberg|1999|pp=48<U+2013>50}}</ref> He played in the Los Alamos Symphony, accompanying local performances of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and Handel's ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''.<ref name="Post"/> He was chairman of the board of the local bank, and a member of the local school board.<ref name=fal />

Graves died of a heart attack on July 19, 1965 while skiing in [[Del Norte, Colorado]], twenty years after the Slotin accident, at the age of 54.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[Time Magazine]] |url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,834164,00.html |title=Milestones |date= August 6, 1965 |accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> He was interred in the Guaje Pines Cemetery in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]].<ref name="FG"/> A follow-up study in 1978 of the Slotin accident victims indicated that his death was possibly caused by latent systemic damage leading to heart failure from the accident.<ref name=hempelman />
