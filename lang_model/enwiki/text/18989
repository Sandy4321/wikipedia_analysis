==''Wonderland: A Year in the Life of an American High School''==
[[Image:Wonderland-cover.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Bamberger's book documents the senior year of Pennsbury High School students.]]

In [[2002]], Pennsbury High School's prom tradition caught the attention of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' senior writer [[Michael Bamberger]].  After writing an article for the magazine about the 2002 prom, Bamberger went on to write a book, ''Wonderland: A Year in the Life of an American High School'', which chronicled the senior year of a group of Pennsbury students. The rights for the book were bought by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], and [[MTV]] and [[Tollin/Robbins Productions]] were to produce the film, which had tenatively been named ''Pennsbury.'' <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117886229.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1&query=pennsbury | title=Variety: Par dresses for prom pic 'Pennsbury' | accessdate=2007-02-27 }}</ref>  In 2004, [[Mike Tollin]] and [[Brian Robbins]] signed with [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Studios]] <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117901244.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1&query=pennsbury | title=Variety: Tollin/Robbins inks pic pact | accessdate=2007-02-27 }}</ref>, leaving the status of the project uncertain.

Bob Costa, one of the students documented by Bamberger in the book, spent his senior year spearheading an effort to get [[John Mayer (musician)|John Mayer]] to perform at Pennsbury's senior prom. <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6053436/john_mayer_goes_to_the_prom | title=Rolling Stone Magazine: John Mayer Goes to the Prom | accessdate=2007-02-27 }}</ref>  On prom night, [[May 16]], [[2004]], the singer performed a three song set.  Mayer followed in the footsteps of multi-platinum bands like [[Eve 6]] and [[Maroon 5]], who performed special acoustic shows at Pennsbury in 2003 organized by Costa. In 2007, popular rapper (and Pennsbury alumnus) Asher Roth performed. On [[May 16]], [[2009]], pop rock musician [[Ryan Cabrera]] performed.

==PCJB - The Pennsbury Concert Jazz Band==
The Pennsbury Concert Jazz Band has long been considered one of the finest musical ensembles in the country. Year after year it consistently earns some of the highest rankings at the festivals in which it competes. Since it<U+2019>s beginnings in the early 1950<U+2019>s, the musicians in this group have performed jazz music at a level not typical of high school age students.

According to a May 2001 article in the Yardley News, one of the earliest <U+201C>bookings<U+201D> on record for the novice band came on June 2, 1960 when the Pennsbury <U+201C>Stage Band,<U+201D> as PCJB was then known, appeared on Chubby Jackson<U+2019>s early morning program, <U+201C>The Little Rascals Show,<U+201D> broadcast in New York, Ch. 7, WABC-TV. Time traveling back even further, to the early 50s, a group of Pennsbury musicians formed and called themselves the <U+201C>Dance Band,<U+201D> reminiscent of those popular bands from the big band era of the previous decade.

Area locals with an historical musical perspective may recall the Lambertville (NJ) Music Circus where top musicians in the jazz world had frequent billings. Dated newspaper clippings from the band archives highlight several appearances made at this popular venue by the Pennsbury Stage Band. It was directed by Pennsbury music teacher, Don Smith, who is credited with having formed the band around 1954. Music Circus impresario, St. John Terrell, called the Pennsbury band <U+201C>one of the most interesting and tightly organized jazz bands<U+201D> he knew. In an early band archive news clipping, on a May 1961 Lambertville Music Circus booking, a reporter wrote that <U+201C>many of the high notes flowing from the brass bells amazed musicians in the audience, since musicians of this (high school) age rarely attain the music control to produce such difficult passages.<U+201D>

From their first notes played in the band room at PHS, many PCJB alumni have gone on to successful careers as professional musicians gracing stages and recording studios around the world. Many others have become music educators inspiring countless students to achieve their own high level of musical excellence.

Past directors and assistants include - founders Don Smith and Bill Fabrizio, John Mack, Barry Vannauker, Gene Polaski, Michael Grothman, Kawika Kahalehoe, Mark Morris, Chris Bygott, Frank Mazzeo, Jon Rees and Mark Capriotti.

==School bus accident==
On [[January 12]] [[2007]], seventeen Pennsbury High School students were [[injury|injured]] when a school bus veered into a group of students as they left school.  The bus "jumped a curb outside one of the school buildings, drove over a sidewalk, barreled down an access road, mowed down a [[fence]] and slammed head-on into the [[retaining wall]]." <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=17706786&BRD=2212&PAG=461&dept_id=465812&rfi=6 | title=NEPA News: 17 students hospitalized after school bus hits pedestrians, wall | accessdate=2007-02-28 }}</ref>  All injured students required [[hospital|hospitalization]] for their injuries.   The incident received nationwide media coverage.

Ashley Zauflik, the most seriously injured student, suffered a [[bone fracture|fractured]] [[pelvis]], [[internal bleeding]] and a crushed left [[leg]], which later had to be [[amputation|amputated]] above the [[knee]].  She was released from the hospital on [[February 22]]. <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/2007/02/23/news/local/states/pennsylvania/counties/montgomery_county/16764523.htm | title=Philadelphia Inquirer: Bus victim back home, Pennsbury High girl "thrilled" after six weeks in a hospital. | accessdate=2007-02-28 }}</ref>  All other students injured in the accident have returned to school. 

The [[NTSB]] announced they had "not found any major mechanical errors with the school bus," however did note that the [[brakes]] were out of adjustment.  The vehicle, a [[Thomas Built Buses|Thomas]] Saf-T-Liner MVP-ER school bus, was involved in a similar accident in [[1994]]. <ref>{{cite web| url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=local&id=4949037 | title=ABC News: NTSB - No Mechanical Problems with Pennsbury Bus | accessdate=2007-02-28 }}</ref>

On [[March 13]] [[2007]], Falls Township police concluded that the school bus driver slammed on the [[Automobile pedal|gas pedal]] instead of the brake.  The driver was not driving his usual vehicle, and "the [[Accelerator (car)|accelerator]] of the replacement bus was close in shape and location to the brake in the bus he normally drove."  The school bus driver remains on paid leave, and officials have said charges will not be filed.  The school bus driver disagrees with the results of the investigation, claiming it was mechanical failure, and his [[Lawyer|attorney]] intends to "conduct his own investigation of the crash." <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17596461/ | title=MSNBC: Police Say Bus Driver At Fault In Crash | accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref> The results of the NTSB's investigation will take 6-12 months to complete.    A lawyer representing Ashley Zauflik indicated a [[civil lawsuit]] would be filed. <ref>{{cite web| url=http://cbs3.com/topstories/local_story_071233954.html | title=KYW.com: Police Release Pennsbury Bus Crash Findings | accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref>

Two days after police announced the results of their investigation, a [[arson|fire]] damaged two Pennsbury school buses parked outside a school district garage.  School district officials said it was too "speculative" to connect the two events, however they also deemed the fire "suspicious." <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/111-03152007-1314816.html | title=Bucks County Courier Times: Pennsbury calls fire at bus garage suspicious | accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref>  Fire investigators later concluded the fire was intentionally set. <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/113-03222007-1318374.html | title=Bucks County Courier Times: Investigators- Bus fire intentionally set | accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref>
