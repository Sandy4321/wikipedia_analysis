'''Brian Wade Grant''' (born March 5, 1972 in [[Columbus, Ohio]]) is a retired [[United States|American]] [[basketball]] player. He played the [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] and [[Center (basketball)|center]] positions for five teams during 12 seasons in the [[National Basketball Association]]. He was known for his tenacious [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] and blue-collar defense. During his career, he played with the [[Sacramento Kings]] (where he made First Team All-Rookie in the [[1994<U+2013>95 NBA season|1994<U+2013>95 season]]), [[Portland Trail Blazers]], [[Miami Heat]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[Phoenix Suns]].

== College career ==
He was picked up on the Xavier University basketball team where he was second on the all-time leading scorers' list. He became the two-time [[Midwest Collegiate Conference]] Player of the Year at [[Xavier University (Cincinnati)|Xavier University]] in Cincinnati, Ohio. He continued to practice with the coaches after each practice and continue to get better. All four seasons with Xavier University he led his team in rebounding, and was third on the all-time leading rebounding list. He was named to the Associated Press' honorable mention All-American team in his junior year, after ranking second in the nation in field goal percentage with 65.4 percent.

== NBA career ==
Grant was drafted in the first round, eight overall, in the [[1994 NBA Draft]] by the Sacramento Kings. He signed a 5-year, 29 million dollar contract.

Grant opted out of the deal following the 1997 season to sign a 7-year, $56 million deal with the Trail Blazers. After two years as the starting PF and one year as the Blazers' number one big man off the bench, Grant once again opted out of his deal to become a free agent, hoping to land a starting gig elsewhere.

In the summer of 2000 Grant signed a mega-deal with Miami: 7 years, $86 million, despite coming off season averages of 7.5 ppg and 5.5 rpgg. The deal raised eyebrows, but Heat GM [[Pat Riley]] insisted that Grant was the missing piece to the Heat's championship puzzle. Grant responded by putting up a career season of 15.2 ppg, 8.8 rpg, and a career high 79.7% at the foul line, despite having to play out of position at center while his natural position is at [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]].

During the summer of 2004, he was traded (along with [[Caron Butler]], [[Lamar Odom]], and a future first-round draft pick) to the Lakers in exchange for [[Shaquille O'Neal]]. Grant was released the following off-season and signed with Phoenix. He was traded in the [[2006 NBA Draft]] to the [[Boston Celtics]] with the rights to [[Rajon Rondo]] in exchange for a future first-round draft pick. After being waived by the Celtics on October 27, 2006, Grant formally announced his retirement after lingering injuries had reduced his level of play for several seasons.

He is nicknamed "The General" after growing up in the same town as [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] general and [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]].

Grant also has a tattoo of famed [[reggae]] [[singer]] [[Bob Marley]] on his right arm, among others. He is widely known for the long dreadlocks he sported throughout most of his career.

Brian worked with current [[Portland Trail Blazers]] center [[Greg Oden]] in the 2009 off-season in Columbus, Ohio for the purposes of adding more toughness, basketball smarts, and miscellaneous advice.<ref>http://blog.oregonlive.com/behindblazersbeat/2009/07/brian_grant_toughening_up_greg.html</ref>
