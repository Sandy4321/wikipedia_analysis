is an international news network [[headquarter]]ed in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]]. Initially launched as an Arabic news and [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] [[satellite TV]] channel with the same [[name]], Al Jazeera has since expanded into a network with several outlets, including the Internet and [[specialty channel|specialty]] [[television channel|TV channels]] in multiple languages.  Al Jazeera is accessible in several world regions.

The original Al Jazeera channel's willingness to broadcast dissenting views, including on [[Phone in|call-in]] shows, created controversies in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. The station gained worldwide attention following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], when it was the only channel to cover the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|war in Afghanistan]] live from its office there.

==Organization==
The original Al Jazeera channel was started in 1996 by an [[Decree|emiri decree]] with a loan of 500 million [[Qatari riyal]]s ([[United States dollar|US$]]137 million) from the [[List of emirs of Qatar|Emir of Qatar]], [[Sheikh]] [[Hamad bin Khalifa]].<ref>Naomi Sakr, 2001.

Following the initial US$137 million grant from the [[Emir of Qatar]], Al Jazeera had aimed to become self-sufficient through advertising by 2001, but when this failed to occur, the Emir agreed to several consecutive loans<ref name="books.google.com"/> on a year-by-year basis (US$30 million in 2004,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060427171936/http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20040506-085117-7996r.htm Tutwiler's mission impossible]</ref> according to [[Arnaud de Borchgrave]]).

===Staff===
The Chairman of Al Jazeera is Sheikh [[Hamad bin Thamer|Hamad bin Thamer al-Thani]], a distant cousin of [[Qatar]]i Emir Sheikh [[Hamad bin Khalifa|Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani]].

Al Jazeera recently restructured its operations to form a Network that contains all their different channels. [[Wadah Khanfar]], the managing director of the Arabic Channel was appointed as the Director General of the Al Jazeera Network. He also acts as the  Managing Director of the Arabic channel. He is supported by [[Ahmed Sheikh]], Editor-in-Chief, and [[Amen Jaballah]].

The Editor-in-Chief of the Arabic website is [[Ahmed Sheikh]]. It has more than 100 editorial staff.

The Editor-in-Chief of the English-language site is [[Mohamed Nanabhay]]. He replaced Beat Witschi, who was caretaking the website after [[Russell Merryman]], the previous Editor-in-Chief, moved to a new development role. He replaced Omar Bec who was caretaking the site after the departure of Managing Editor Alison Balharry. Previous incumbents include Joanne Tucker and Ahmed Sheikh.

Prominent on-air personalities include [[Faisal al-Qassem]], host of the talk show ''The Opposite Direction'', Ahmed Mansour, host of the show ''Unlimited (bi-la hudud)'' and Sami Haddad.

[[Yosri Fouda]], producer and presenter of an investigative journalism program ''Top Secret'' announced his resignation from Al Jazeera in May 2009.

==Reach==
It is widely believed internationally that inhabitants of the Arab world are given limited information by their governments and media, and that what is conveyed is [[bias]]ed towards the governments' views.<ref name="boot" /> Many people see Al Jazeera as a more trustworthy source of information than government and foreign channels.  Some scholars and commentators use the notion of ''[[contextual objectivity]]'',<ref name="ref1" /> which highlights the tension between objectivity and audience appeal, to describe the station's controversial yet popular news approach.<ref name="tbsjournal fall02">[http://www.tbsjournal.com/Archives/Fall02/Iskandar.html The Minotaur of 'Contextual Objectivity': War coverage and the pursuit of accuracy with appeal]</ref> As a result, it is probably the most watched news channel in the [[Middle East]].
Increasingly, Al Jazeera's exclusive interviews and other footage are being rebroadcast in American, British, and other western media outlets such as [[CNN]] and the [[BBC]]. In January 2003, the BBC announced that it had signed an agreement with Al Jazeera for sharing facilities and information, including news footage.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2668007.stm BBC in news deal with Arabic TV] BBC News, published 17 January 2003</ref> Al Jazeera is now considered by some to be a fairly mainstream media network, though more controversial than most. In the United States as of 2006, video footage from the network carried by other stations was largely limited to video segments of hostages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Al Jazeera's availability (via satellite) throughout the Middle East changed the television landscape of the region. Prior to the arrival of Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to watch TV channels other than state-censored national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of [[freedom of speech]] on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many [[Persian Gulf]] states, including [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]] and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about [[Syria]]'s relationship with [[Lebanon]], and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: For example, on 27 January 1999, Al Jazeera had critics of the Algerian government on during their live program ''El-Itidjah el-Mouakass'' (="The Opposite Direction"). The Algerian government cut the electricity supply to at least large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly to large parts of the country), to prevent the program from being seen.<ref name="boot">[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 Books of our Time: Al-Jazeera] at [[Google Video]]; TV programme feat.

At that time, Al Jazeera was not yet generally known in the [[Western world]], but where it was known, the opinion about it was often favourable<ref>E.g. in 1999, [[New York Times]] reporter [[Thomas L. Friedman]] called Al-Jazeera "the freest, most widely watched TV network in the Arab world." <U+2013> {{cite journal|author=Friedman, Thomas L.|title=Fathers and Sons|journal=[[New York Times]]|date=12 February 1999|volume=|issue=|pages=A27|url= }}</ref> and Al Jazeera claimed to be the only [[politics|politically]] independent television station in the [[Middle East]]. However, it wasn't until late 2001 that Al Jazeera achieved worldwide recognition, when it broadcast video statements by [[al-Qaeda]] leaders.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2460705.stm Al Jazeera and Bin Laden]</ref>

===Expansion outside the Middle East===
{{Main|Al Jazeera English}}

In 2003, Al Jazeera hired its first English-language journalists, among whom [http://www.afshinrattansi.com Afshin Rattansi], from the BBC's [[Today Programme]].

In March 2003, it launched an [http://aljazeera.net/english English-language website] (see [[#On the Web|below]]).

On 4 July 2005 Al Jazeera officially announced plans to launch a new English-language satellite service to be called [[Al Jazeera International]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20050710010536/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/07/04/aljazeera.spread.ap/index.html Al Jazeera turns its signal West]</ref>
The new channel started at 12h [[GMT]] on 15 November 2006 under the name [[Al Jazeera English]] and has broadcast centers in [[Doha]] (next to the original Al Jazeera headquarters and broadcast center), [[London]], [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Washington D.C.]]. The channel is a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week news channel, with 12 hours broadcast from Doha, and four hours each from London, Kuala Lumpur, and [[Washington D.C.]]. This offer came from a [[non-profit]] US network which also broadcasts Russian-language programming for free to US viewers.

With Al Jazeera's growing global outreach and influence, some scholars including [[Adel Iskandar]] have described the station as a transformation of the very definition of "[[alternative media]]."<ref>[http://www.tbsjournal.com/Iskandar.html Is Al Jazeera Alternative? Mainstreaming Alterity and Assimilating Discourses of Dissent]</ref>

As of 2007, the Arabic Al Jazeera channel rivals the BBC in worldwide audiences with an estimated 40 to 50 million viewers.<ref>[http://allied-media.com/aljazeera/JAZdemog.html Audience Demographics and Viewership Profile]</ref> [[Al Jazeera English]] has an estimated reach of around 100 million households.<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/C233F6D4-0BD5-454A-88E3-ED1A0914AF3B.htm Release: We break 100 million barrier]</ref>

On November 26, 2009, Al Jazeera English received approval from the CRTC, which enables Al Jazeera English to broadcast via Satellite in Canada.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2009/11/26/al-jazeera.html Al-Jazeera English gets CRTC approval]</ref>

On September 22, 2010, Al Jazeera purchased a broadcasting station in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and is set to begin broadcasting in January 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=Al Jazeera makes its Balkan debut |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,6031138,00.html|newspaper=Deutsche Welle|date=22 September 2010}}</ref>

===Availability===
The original Al Jazeera channel is available worldwide through various satellite and cable systems.<ref>[http://www.allied-media.com/ARABTV/aljazeera/Coverage.htm Al Jazeera TV Footprint - Coverage]</ref> In the U.S., it is available through subscription satellite and [[free to air]] [[DVB-S]] on the [[Galaxy 25]] and [[Galaxy 23]] satellites. Al Jazeera can also be freely viewed with a DVB-S receiver in Europe, [[Northern Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] as it is broadcast on the [[SES Astra|Astra]] and [[Hot Bird]] satellites. The [[Optus C1]] satellite in [[Australia]] carries the channel for free, while in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] Al Jazeera English is available on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], [[Sky (UK & Ireland)|Sky]] and [[Freesat]] platforms.

For availability info of the Al Jazeera network's other TV channels, see their respective articles. Segments of Al Jazeera English are uploaded to [[YouTube]].<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=AlJazeeraEnglish Al Jazeera YouTube Channel]</ref>

It is also possible to watch Al Jazeera English over the internet from their official website. The low-resolution version is available free of charge,<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/1EBB4C7F-7F2E-4257-A04C-56678862E31A.htm Aljazeera.net]</ref> while the high-resolution version is available under subscription fees through partner sites.

Al Jazeera's English division has also partnered with [[Livestation]] for Internet-based broadcasting.<ref>[http://livestation.com/channels/3-al_jazeera_english Livestation | Watch Al Jazeera English on your PC]</ref> This enables viewers to watch Al Jazeera English and Al Jazeera live worldwide.

===On the Web===
Al Jazeera's web-based service is accessible subscription-free throughout the world. The station launched an [http://english.aljazeera.net English-language edition] of its online content in March 2003. This English language website was relaunched on 15 November 2006, along with the launch of [[Al Jazeera English]]. The English and Arabic sections are editorially distinct, with their own selection of news and comment. Al Jazeera and Al Jazeera English are available streamed live online. On April 13, 2009, Al Jazeera launched condensed versions of its English and Arabic sites for mobile device users.

The Arabic version of the site was brought offline for about 10 hours by an [[FBI]] raid on its ISP, [[InfoCom Corporation]], on 5 September 2001.  InfoCom was later convicted of exporting to [[Libya]] and [[Syria]], of knowingly being invested in by a [[Hamas]] member (both of which are illegal in the United States), and of underpaying customs duties.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://web.archive.org/web/20060221123700/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/txn/PressRel04/elashi_conv.pdf Elisha Brothers convicted]|63.1 [[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 64647 bytes -->}}</ref>

====Web host changes====
The English-language site was forced to change [[web host|internet hosting providers]] several times, due, in Al Jazeera's opinion, to political pressure. Initially, hosting for the English-language site was provided by the U.S.-based company [[DataPipe]], which gave Al Jazeera notice, soon followed by [[Akamai Technologies]].<ref name="net" /> Al Jazeera later shifted to the French branch of [[NavLink]], and then to (the current host) [[AT&T]] [[WorldNet]] Services.

====Creative Commons====
On January 13, 2009, Al Jazeera released some of its broadcast quality footage from Gaza under a Creative Commons license. Contrary to business "All Rights Reserved" standards, the license invites third parties, including rival broadcasters, to reuse and remix the footage, so long as Al Jazeera is credited.

===Plans===
Future announced products include Al Jazeera in a number of other languages <U+2014> these would include [[Al Jazeera Urdu]], an [[Urdu]] language channel to cater mainly to [[Pakistan]]is.<ref>[http://www.ameinfo.com/76550.html Aljazeera and ARY Digital Network to launch Aljazeera Urdu | Al Jazeera<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Al Jazeera has also been reported to be planning to launch an international newspaper.<ref>[http://www.arabianbusiness.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3462 Al Jazeera plans to launch Arab newspaper] [[Arabian Business]]; published Saturday 4, November 2006</ref>

Al Jazeera Arabic began using a [[chroma key]] studio on 13 September 2009. Similar to [[Sky News]], Al Jazeera broadcasted from that studio while the channels main newsroom was given a new look. The channel relaunched, with new graphics and music along with a new studio, on November 1, 2009, the 13th birthday of the channel.

== Attacks on and censorship of Al Jazeera ==
=== Algeria===
On 27 January 1999, several Algerian cities lost power simultaneously, reportedly to keep residents from watching a program in which Algerian dissidents implicated the Algerian military in a series of massacres.<ref name="boot" /><ref name="ref1" /><ref name="Algeria" />

On 4 July 2004, the Algerian government froze the activities of Al Jazeera's Algerian correspondent. The official reason given was that a reorganization of the work of foreign correspondents was in progress. The international pressure group [[Reporters Without Borders]] says, however, that the measure was really taken in reprisal for a broadcast the previous week of another ''Al-Itijah al-Mouakiss'' debate on the political situation in Algeria.<ref>[http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=10868 RSF strongly condemns ban on al-Jazeera]</ref>

=== Palestinian Territories ===
On 15 July 2009, the [[Palestinian Authority]] in the West Bank closed down Al Jazeera's offices in the territory, apparently in response to claims made on the channel by [[Farouk Kaddoumi]] that PA President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] had been involved in the death of [[Yasser Arafat]]. In a statement announcing the decision, the information ministry said the station's coverage was "unbalanced" and accused it of incitement against the PLO and the PA.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/8152418.stm Al-Jazeera closed in West Bank]</ref>

On 19 July 2009, Abbas rescinded this ban and allowed Al Jazeera to resume operations.<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ilbhZDN6qp-yUcyVBZEP_3TjjSFAD99HFR302 AP:  Ban on Al-Jazeera operations in West Bank lifted]</ref>

=== United States ===
On November 13, 2001, during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|US invasion of Afghanistan]], 2001, a U.S. missile strike destroyed Al Jazeera's office in [[Kabul]]. There were no casualties.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1653887.stm Al-Jazeera Kabul offices hit in US raid]</ref>

In the run-up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the U.S. Pentagon hired the [[Rendon Group]] to target and possibly punish Al Jazeera reporters who did not stay on message.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/_/id/8798997 The Man Who Sold the War] by James Bamford; [[Rolling Stone]]; published 17 November 2005</ref> When Al Jazeera went on to do reporting featuring very graphic footage from inside Iraq, US officials decried Al Jazeera as anti-American and as inciting violence.<ref name="iraqwar" />

The [[New York Stock Exchange]] banned Al Jazeera (as well as several other news organizations whose identities were not revealed) from its trading floor indefinitely. NYSE spokesman Ray Pellechia claimed "security reasons" and that the exchange had decided to give access only to networks that focus "on responsible business coverage". He denied the revocation has anything to do with the network's [[Iraq]] war coverage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20051124201030/http://www.apfw.org/indexenglish.asp?fname=news%5cenglish%5c12018.htm |title=Al Jazeera banned from NYSE floor |publisher=Arab Press Freedom Watch}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/03/25/news/nyse_aljazeera |title=Al Jazeera ousted from NYSE |date=2003-03-25 | work=CNN | first=Parija | last=Bhatnagar}}</ref> However, Robert Zito, the exchange's executive vice president for communications, indicated that Al Jazeera's graphic footage broadcast on Sunday, 22 March 2003, led him to oust Al Jazeera.<ref name=NYSECens/> The move was quickly mirrored by [[Nasdaq]] stock market officials.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/media/media_watch/jan-june03/aljazeera_03-26-03.html Al Jazeera banned from two Wall Street exchanges (26 March 2003)]</ref>

==== Al Jazeera bombing memo ====
{{Main|Al Jazeera bombing memo}}
:''Also see [[O'Connor - Keogh official secrets trial]]''.
On 22 November 2005, the UK [[tabloid]] ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' published a story claiming that it had obtained a leaked memo from [[10 Downing Street]] saying that former [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] had considered bombing Al Jazeera's Doha headquarters in April 2004, when [[U.S. Marines]] were conducting a contentious assault on [[Fallujah]].<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10153489/ MSN.com]</ref>

In light of this allegation, Al Jazeera has questioned whether it has been targeted deliberately in the past <U+2014> Al Jazeera's [[Kabul]] office was bombed in 2001 and another missile hit its office in [[Baghdad]] during the invasion of Iraq, killing correspondent [[Tareq Ayyoub]]. Both of these attacks occurred subsequent to Al Jazeera's disclosure of the locations of their offices to the United States.<ref name="web.archive.org">[http://web.archive.org/web/20050316091119/http://www.sfbg.com/wartime/fisk_journalists.html Did the US murder these Journalists?] by [[Robert Fisk]]; [[SF Bay Guardian]]; published 26 April 2003</ref>

=== Website attacks ===
Immediately after its launch in 2003, the English site was attacked by one or several [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]], who launched [[denial-of-service attack]]s, and another hacker who redirected visitors to a site featuring an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2987342.stm Al-Jazeera hacker pleads guilty] BBC News; published Friday, 13 June 2003</ref><ref name="net">[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/07/al_jazeera_and_the_net/ Al Jazeera and the Net - free speech, but don't say <em>that</em>] by John Lettice; [[The Register]]; published Monday, 7 April 2003</ref> Both events were widely reported as Al Jazeera's website having been attacked by "[[Hacker definition controversy|hacker]]s".<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20040214162627/http://media.guardian.co.uk/newmedia/story/0,7496,922264,00.html Al-Jazeera websites 'hit by hackers'] by Dominic Timms; Guardian Unlimited; published Wednesday, 26 March 2003</ref> In November 2003, John William Racine II, also known as 'John Buffo', was sentenced to 1,000 hours of community service and a $1,500 U.S. fine for the online disruption.

==Controversy==
While Al Jazeera has a large audience in the Middle East and worldwide, the organization and the original Arabic channel in particular have been involved in numerous controversies,<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/News/Archive/Archive?ArchiveID=38330 Al Jazeera under fire]</ref> including in some parts of the Western world. Americans in general have an unfavourable view of Al Jazeera.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHLQiwqKbmQ Mosaic Intelligence Report - 17 November 2006]; NB: the poll figures quoted in the report are from a poll analysis apparently commissioned by [[Accuracy in Media]] with the goal of exploring how the US public could be mobilised against Al Jazeera (cf. section "In Conclusion<U+2026>" of {{PDFlink|[http://www.pollingcompany.com/cms/files/AIM%20Omnibus%20Analysis%20to%20Client.pdf survey analysis document]|39.1 [[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 40088 bytes -->}}).</ref>

A widely reported criticism is the false allegation that Al Jazeera had shown videos of masked terrorists beheading western [[hostage]]s in Iraq.<ref name="rumsfeld">[http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=12703 Rumsfeld blames Al Jazeera over Iraq]</ref> When this was reported in other media, Al Jazeera pressed for retractions to be made.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/leaders/story/0,3604,1649144,00.html Was George Bush serious about attack on Al Jazeera?]</ref> This allegation was again repeated on [[Fox News]] in the USA on the launch day of Al Jazeera's English service, 15 November 2006.<ref>by [[L. Brent Bozell III|Brent Bozell]] at 12.30 [[North American Eastern Time Zone|ET]] during the Fox Online program ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otUkfaSljSk YouTube video])</ref>  Later ''[[The Guardian]]'' apologized for incorrect information that Al Jazeera 'had shown videos of masked terrorists beheading western hostages'.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/leaders/story/0,3604,1649144,00.html The Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday 30 November 2005]</ref>

Al Jazeera has been entangled in the following controversies:

===Bahrain===
The [[Bahrain]]i Information Minister, [[Nabeel Yacoob Al Hamer]], banned Al Jazeera correspondents from reporting from inside the country on 10 May 2002, saying that the station was biased towards Israel and against Bahrain.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/middle_east/1980191.stm Bahrain bans Al Jazeera TV]</ref> After improvements in relations between Bahrain and Qatar in 2004, Al Jazeera correspondents returned to Bahrain.

===Iraq===
During the ongoing Iraq war, Al Jazeera faced reporting and movement restrictions, as did other news-gathering organizations. In addition, one of its reporters, [[Tayseer Allouni]], was expelled from the country, while another one, Diyar Al-Omari, was stripped of his journalistic permits by the US. Reacting to this, Al Jazeera announced on 2 April 2003, that it would "temporarily freeze all coverage" of Iraq in protest of what Al Jazeera described as unreasonable interference from Iraqi officials.<ref>[http://www.cpj.org/news/2003/Iraq03apr03na.html CPJ News Alert - Missing journalist's wife demands more information]</ref>
In May 2003, the [[CIA]], through the [[Iraqi National Congress]], released documents purportedly showing that Al Jazeera had been infiltrated by Iraqi [[spy|spies]], and was regarded by Iraqi officials as part of their propaganda effort. As reported by the [[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]], the alleged spies were described by an Al Jazeera executive as having minor roles with no input on editorial decisions.

On  23 September 2003, [[Iraq]] suspended Al Jazeera (and [[Al-Arabiya]]) from reporting on official government activities for two weeks for what the Council stated as supporting recent attacks on council members and Coalition occupational forces. The move came after allegations by Iraqis who stated that the channel had incited anti-occupation violence (by airing statements from [[Iraqi insurgency]] leaders), increasing ethnic and sectarian tensions, and being supportive of the insurgency.

During 2004, Al Jazeera broadcast several video tapes of various victims of kidnappings in Iraq, which had been sent to the network. The videos had been filmed by the kidnappers holding the hostages. The hostages were shown, often blindfolded, pleading for their release. They often appeared to be forced to read out prepared statements of their kidnappers.  Al Jazeera has assisted authorities from the home countries of the victims in an attempt to secure the release of kidnapping victims. This included broadcasting pleas from family members and government officials. Contrary to some allegations, including the oft-reported comments of [[Donald Rumsfeld]] on 4 June 2005, Al Jazeera has never shown [[decapitation|beheadings]]. (Beheadings have appeared on numerous non-Al Jazeera websites and have sometimes been misattributed to Al Jazeera.)<ref name="rumsfeld" />

On 7 August 2004, the Iraqi [[Iyad Allawi|Allawi]] government shut down the Iraq office of Al Jazeera, claiming that it was responsible for presenting a negative image of Iraq, and charging the network with fueling anti-Coalition hostilities. Al Jazeera spokesman Jihad Ballout said: "It's regrettable and we believe it's not justifiable. This latest decision runs contrary to all the promises made by Iraqi authorities concerning freedom of expression and freedom of the press,"<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/08/08/1091903451848.html Militia dig in as fighting rages in holy city] [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]; published 9 August 2004</ref> and Al Jazeera vowed to continue its reporting from inside Iraq.<ref>[http://www.media-alliance.org/medianews/archives/000532.php Iraqi Government Shuts Al-Jazeera Station] by Rawya Rageh; [[Associated Press]]; published 7 August 2004</ref> News photographs showed United States and Iraqi military personnel working together to close the office.

In April 2003, the Qatar channel broadcasted a long commemorative program showing ex-General of the Iraqi Republican Guards, Sayf ad-Din Rawi, who claimed that a [[neutron bomb]] had been dropped on the international airport of Bagdad during the invasion of Iraq.<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/04/200852514126899448.html "US accused of using neutron bombs"]</ref> This accusation was easy to deny{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}, and was based on the popular belief that neutron bombs only produce radiation while leaving infrastructure intact. Also, a nuclear weapon like a neutron bomb produces nuclear fallout which is easily, and rapidly perceptible from other countries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Israel===
On 19 July 2008, Al Jazeera TV broadcast a program from Lebanon that covered the "welcome-home" festivities for [[Samir Kuntar]], a Lebanese militant who had been imprisoned in Israel for murdering several people in a [[Palestine Liberation Front]] raid from Lebanon into Israel. In the program, the head of Al Jazeera's Beirut office, Ghassan bin Jiddo, praised Kuntar as a "pan-Arab hero" and organized a birthday party for him. In response, Israel's Government Press Office (GPO) threatened to boycott the satellite channel unless it apologized. A few days later an official letter was issued by Al Jazeera's director general, Wadah Khanfar, in which he admitted that the program violated the station's Code of Ethics and that he had ordered the channel's programming director to take steps to ensure that such an incident does not recur.

The television network was also criticized for allegedly biased coverage of events in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], including the [[Bat Mitzvah massacre]] in 2002, where the network failed to note that the massacre victims were attending a [[bat mitzvah]] celebration for a 12 year old girl, and neglected to mention that the gunman crashed the event at a crowded banquet hall.<ref name="hickey"/> When the Palestinian militant [[Raed Karmi]] was assassinated by the Israeli army, Al Jazeera was criticized for failing to mention Israeli accusations about how many people he had killed, which would have provided a context for the story.<ref name="hickey">Perspectives on war. By Hickey, Neil, Columbia Journalism Review, March 1 2002 </ref>

===Qatar===
Al Jazeera has been criticized for failing to report on many hard hitting news stories that originate from [[Qatar]], where Al Jazeera is based. The two most frequently cited stories were the revoking of citizenship from the Al Ghafran clan of the [[Al Murrah]] tribe in response to a failed coup that members of the Al Ghafran clan were implicated in, and Qatar's growing relations with and diplomatic visits to [[Israel]].<ref>[http://secretdubai.blogspot.com/2005/04/into-exile.html Secret Dubai diary: into exile]</ref>

===Egypt===
Al Jazeera has been criticized by numerous Egyptian newspapers and other forms of media for its continuous attacks against Egypt and its government to "destroy Egypt<U+2019>s image in the region" as they suggest.

===Somalia===
In January 2009 Al Jazeera aired a documentary on toxic waste dumped in Somalia. A Somali journalist who studied the contents of the two part  Al Jazeera documentary, ''The Toxic Truth'',<ref>{{en icon}} [http://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/peopleandpower/2009/01/200911873234971487.html Aljazeera.net]</ref> has concluded that Al Jazeera failed to rigorously research the story because one of the letters used to substantiate arms smuggling  was  issued on 15 April 1992, from  the Ministry of Defence of People's Democratic Republic of Yemen,  almost two years after [[South Yemen]]  and [[North Yemen]] united to form  the [[Republic of Yemen]] in May 1990.<ref>[http://www.somalipressreview.com/view.php?articleid=1058 Somalipressreview.com]</ref> Another criticism of the documentary was that Al Jazeera did not allow  [[Ali Mahdi Muhammad]], former interim president of [[Somalia]], to exercise his [[right of reply]] for being accused of authorising [[Italy]] based companies to build dumping grounds in Somalia.

===Spain===
{{Main|Tayseer Allouni}}

Reporter [[Tayseer Allouni]] was arrested in Spain on 5 September 2003, on a charge of having provided support for members of [[al-Qaeda]].<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0309/05/lol.01.html Al-Jazeera Arrest] [[CNN]]; published 5 September 2003</ref> Judge [[Baltasar Garz<U+00F3>n]], who had issued the arrest warrant, ordered Allouni held without bail. Al Jazeera wrote to then Spanish Prime Minister [[Jose Maria Aznar]] and protested: "On several occasions Western journalists met secretly with secret organizations and they were not subjected to any legal action because they were doing their job, so why is Allouni being excluded?"<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060212173348/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2003/09/11/international0805EDT0515.DTL Spanish judge orders Al-Jazeera reporter to jail] by Mar Roman; [[Associated Press]]; published Thursday, September 11, 2003</ref> Allouni was released on bail several weeks later over health concerns, but prohibited from leaving the country.

On 19 September, a Spanish court issued an arrest warrant for Allouni before the expected verdict. Allouni had asked the court for permission to visit his family in [[Syria]] to attend the funeral of his mother but authorities denied his request and instead ordered him back to jail.<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/archive/archive?ArchiveId=7762 Aljazeera reporter placed in detention] Al Jazeera; published Wednesday, 19 January 2005</ref>

Although he pleaded not guilty of all the charges against him, Allouni was sentenced on 26 September 2005 to seven years in prison for being a financial courier for al-Qaeda. Allouni insisted he merely interviewed [[Osama bin Laden|bin Laden]] after the September 11 attack on the United States.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060525050736/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/127CA659-BC10-4E1C-9EB2-51744C2197D7.htm Special Reports - Taysir Alluni] Al Jazeera</ref> Al Jazeera has continuously supported Allouni and maintain that he is innocent.<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/News/Archive/Archive?ArchiveID=38328 A fight for justice - Al Jazeera]</ref>

Many international and private organizations ([[Reporters Without Borders]] among them) condemned the arrest and called on the Spanish court to free Taysir Allouni.<ref>e.g. [http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=15029 Al Jazeera journalist re-arrested 10 days before trial verdict]</ref> Websites such as [http://www.alonysolidarity.net Alony Solidarity] were created to support Allouni.

===United Kingdom===
UK officials, like their US counterparts, strongly protested against Al Jazeera's coverage of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Al Jazeera stated that the coalition leaders were taking exception because its reporting made it more difficult for both countries to manage the way the war was being reported.<ref name="iraqwar">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2893689.stm Al-Jazeera: News channel in the news] BBC News; published Saturday, 29 March 2003</ref>

=== United States ===
While prior to 11 September 2001, the [[United States government]] had lauded Al Jazeera for its role as an independent media outlet in the Middle East, US officials have since claimed an anti-American bias to Al Jazeera's news coverage.<ref name="iraqwar" /><ref name="differentwars">[http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0325/p01s04-woiq.html World and America watching different wars] [[Christian Science Monitor]]</ref>

The station first gained widespread attention in the West following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], when it broadcast videos in which [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Sulaiman Abu Ghaith]] defended and justified the attacks. This led to significant controversy and accusations by the United States government that Al Jazeera was engaging in [[propaganda]] on behalf of terrorists. Al Jazeera countered that it was merely making information available without comment, and several western television channels later followed suit in broadcasting portions of the tapes. Analyst James Dunnigan assigns al Jazeera a primary role in the rise of religious hatred and terrorism in the modern Muslim world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strategypage.com/dls/articles/Major-Hasan-Embraces-Tradition-12-3-2009.asp |title=Major Hasan Embraces Tradition|date=December 3, 2009|author=James Dunnigan}}</ref>

On November 13, during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|US invasion of Afghanistan]], 2001, a U.S. missile strike destroyed Al Jazeera's office in [[Kabul]]. There were no casualties.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" />

At a 3 October 2001, press conference, [[Colin Powell]] tried to persuade the emir of Qatar to shut down Al Jazeera.<ref>Colin Powell, news conference with Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Thani, 3 October 2001, Washington D.C.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1089|title=Patriotism & Censorship:"Reining in" journalism|date=December 2001|author=[[FAIR]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A49759-2005Jan30.html|title=Qatar Advances Plans To Privatize Al-Jazeera|date=January 31, 2005|publisher=''[[Washington Post]]'' | first=Shankar | last=Vedantam | accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref>

On 12 October 2008, Al Jazeera broadcast interviews with people attending a [[Sarah Palin]] [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]] rally in [[St. Clairsville, Ohio]], with interviewees making comments about [[Barack Obama]] such as "he regards white people as trash".

==== Detention of Sami Al Hajj ====
{{Main|Sami Al Hajj}}

Al Jazeera cameraman [[Sami Al Hajj]], a [[Sudan]]ese national, was detained while in transit to Afghanistan in December 2001, and up until May 2008 was held, without charge, as an [[enemy combatant]] in [[Camp Delta]] at [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]]. The reasons for his detention remain unknown, although the US' official statement on all detainees is that they are security threats.

=== Dalal al-Maghrabi ===

On July 5, 2008 [[Al-Jazeera]] TV caused controversy by dedicating an Arabic-language program to [[Dalal Mughrabi]]. In the program, the host allegedly "glorified" the Coastal Road incident in which al-Maghrabi and eleven other fighters allegedly killed a total of 36 Israelis, and declared that "Heroism transcends the gender divide", referring to Dalal al-Maghrabi.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memri.org/bin/latestnews.cgi?ID=SD197808 |title=In an Al-Jazeera TV Program on Palestinian Terrorist Dalal Al-Mughrabi, Al-Mughrabi's Sister Salutes Jerusalem Bulldozer Terrorist | date= July 8, 2008|accessdate=2009-05-29 |publisher=[[MEMRI]]}}</ref><ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1149079.html Haaretz.com]</ref>

=== Satellite disruption ===

During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Al Jazeera Sports' transmission in the Arab world went down without explanation in the first half, while the second half transmission was patchy. Al Jazeera and FIFA said they were working to figure out the cause of the disruption to Al Jazeera's official broadcasting rights.<ref>http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/06/2010612134143244810.html</ref>  The British newspaper ''The Guardian'' reported that evidence points toward jamming by the Jordanian government.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/29/al-jazeera-world-cup-coverage-jordan "Foul play: how al-Jazeera's live World Cup football coverage got in a jam"] ''The Guardian'', September 29, 2020</ref>

==Documentaries==

==Competitors==
*In response to Al Jazeera, a group of Saudi investors created [[Al Arabiya]] in the first quarter of 2003. Despite (especially initial) skepticism over the station's Saudi funding (cf. [[#History|History]]) and a perception of censorship of anti-Saudi content,<ref>[http://www.cpj.org/attacks04/mideast04/saudi.html Attacks on the Press - 2004: Mideast]</ref> Al Arabiya has successfully emulated Al Jazeera, garnered a significant audience share, and has also gotten similarly involved in controversy <U+2013> Al Arabiya has been severely criticised by the Iraqi and US authorities and has also had journalists killed on the job.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3236654.stm Profile: Al Arabiya TV]<br/>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4743050.stm Shock over Iraqi reporter's death]</ref>

*In order to counter a perceived bias of Al Jazeera, the U.S. government in 2004 founded [[Al Hurra]] ("the free one"). Al Hurra is forbidden to broadcast to the US under the provisions of the [[Smith-Mundt Act]]. A [[Zogby International|Zogby]] poll found that 1% of Arab viewers watch Al Hurra as their first choice.<ref>[http://www.arabnews.com/?page=7&section=0&article=77899&d=16&m=2&y=2006 Time for the Last Hurrah for US' Al-Hurra]</ref> while an Ipsos-MENA poll from March-May 2008 showed that Alhurra was drawing more viewers in Iraq than Al Jazeera.<ref>[http://uscpublicdiplomacy.com/index.php/newswire/cpdblog_detail/alhurra_locates_the_arab_street/#read_comments USCpublicdiplomacy.com]</ref> Citing these figures, [[Alvin Snyder]] referred to Alhurra as a "go to" network in Iraq.<ref>[http://www.metimes.com/Opinion/2009/01/09/al-hurra_locates_the_arab_street/9311/ MEtimes.com]</ref>

*Since the launch of [[Al Jazeera English]], Al Jazeera directly competes with [[BBC World]] and [[CNN International]], as do a growing number of other [[international broadcasting|international broadcasters]] such as [[France 24]], and [[Russia Today TV|Russia Today]].

*Another competitor is [[Al-Alam News Network|Al-Alam]], Established in 2003 by [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]], it broadcasts continuously. It seeks to address the most challenging issues of the [[Muslim]] and [[Arab world]] and the [[Middle East]].

*A further competitor is the [[Rusiya Al-Yaum]] channel - the first Russian TV news channel broadcasting in Arabic and headquartered in [[Moscow]], Russia. Rusiya Al-Yaum started broadcasting on 4 May 2007 at 7:00 ([[Moscow time]]). The Channel is established and operated by [[RIA Novosti]], the same news agency that launched [[Russia Today TV]] in December 2005 to deliver a Russian perspective on news to English-speaking audiences, and "Rusiya Al-Yaum" is indeed a translation of "Russia Today" into Arabic.

* The BBC launched [[BBC Arabic Television]] on 11 March 2008, an Arabic-language news channel in North Africa and the Middle East.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7288062.stm | work=BBC News | title=BBC launches Arabic TV channel | date=11 March 2008 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref> This is the second time that the BBC is launching an Arabic language TV channel; as mentioned [[#History|above]], the demise of the original BBC World Service Arabic TV channel had at least contributed to the founding of the original Al Jazeera Arabic TV channel.

* Since Euronews started broadcasting its programs in Arabic on the 12 July 2008, it has entered into competition with Al Jazeera. Arabic is the eighth language in which Euronews is published, after English, French, German, Russian, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese.

==Network==
