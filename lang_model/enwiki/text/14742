'''Chew Stoke''' is a small village and [[civil parish]] in the [[Chew Valley]], in [[Somerset]], [[England]], about {{convert|8|mi|km|0|lk=on}} south of [[Bristol]]. It is at the northern edge of the [[Mendip Hills]], a region designated by the United Kingdom as an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], and is within the Bristol/[[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] [[Green Belt]]. The parish includes the hamlet of Breach Hill, which is approximately {{convert|2|mi|km|1}} southwest of Chew Stoke itself.

Chew Stoke has a long history, as shown by the number and range of its [[listed buildings|heritage-listed]] buildings. The village is at the northern end of [[Chew Valley Lake]], which was created in the 1950s, close to a dam, pumping station, sailing club, and fishing lodge. A tributary of the [[River Chew]], which rises in Strode, runs through the village.

The population, approximately 900, is served by one shop, two [[public house]]s, a [[primary school]] and, a [[Bowls|bowling club]]. Together with [[Chew Magna]], it forms the [[Ward (politics)|ward]] of Chew Valley North in the [[unitary authority]] of [[Bath and North East Somerset]]. [[Chew Valley School]] and its associated leisure centre are less than a mile (1.6 km) from Chew Stoke. The village has some areas of light industry but is largely agricultural; many residents commute to nearby cities for employment.

=== Prehistory ===
[[archaeology|Archaeological]] [[excavation]]s carried out between 1953 and 1955 by [[Philip Rahtz]] and [[Ernest Greenfield]] from the [[Ministry of Works]] found evidence of extensive human occupation of the area. Consecutive habitation, spanning thousands of years from the [[Upper Palaeolithic]], [[Mesolithic]], and [[Neolithic]] periods (Old, Middle, and New [[Stone Age]]), to the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s had left numerous [[artifact]]s behind. Discoveries have included stone knives, [[flint]] blades, and the head of a [[Mace (club)|mace]], along with buildings and graves.<ref name="ross">{{cite book | author = Ross, Lesley (Ed.)| year = 2004 | title = Before the Lake: Memories of the Chew Valley | publisher = The Harptree Historic Society | id =ISBN 0-9548832-0-9 }}</ref>

===Romano-Celtic temple===
{{Main|Pagans Hill Roman Temple}}
Chew Stoke is the site of a [[Romano-British|Romano-Celtic]] double-octagonal [[temple]], possibly dedicated to the god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. The temple, on Pagans Hill, was excavated by [[Philip Rahtz]] between 1949 and 1951. It consisted of an inner wall, which formed the sanctuary, surrounded by an outer wall forming an ambulatory, or covered walkway {{convert|56.5|ft|m|1|lk=on}} across. It was first built in the late 3rd century but was twice rebuilt, finally collapsing in the 5th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Aston |first=Michael |authorlink=Mick Aston |coauthors=Rob Iles |title=The archeology of Avon |year=1987 |publisher=Avon County Council |location=Bristol |isbn=0860632822 }}</ref> The positioning of the temple on what is now known as Pagans Hill may seem apt, but there is no evidence for any link between the existence of the temple and the naming of the road.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dunning |first=Robert |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=A History of Somerset |year=1983 |publisher=Phillimore & Co |location=Chichester |id=ISBN 0-85033-461-6 }}</ref>

=== Middle Ages ===
During the [[Middle Ages]], farming was the most important activity in the area, and farming, both [[Arable land|arable]] and [[Dairy farming|dairy]], continues today. There were also orchards producing fruits such as apples, pears, and plums.<ref name="ross" /> Evidence exists of [[Limekiln|lime kilns]], used in the production of mortar for the construction of local churches.

In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, Chew Stoke was listed as ''Chiwestoche'', and was recorded as belonging to Gilbert Fitz-Turold. He conspired with the [[Duke of Normandy]] against King [[William Rufus]], and subsequently, all his lands were seized. The next recorded owner was [[Earl of Hertford|Lord Beauchamp of Hache]]. He became "lord of the manor" when the earls of Gloucester, with hereditary rights to Chew Stoke, surrendered them to him.<ref name="hucker">{{cite book | author = Hucker, Ernest| year = 1997 | title = Chew Stoke Recalled in Old Photographs | publisher = Ernest Hucker | isbn =0953170004 }}</ref> According to Stephen Robinson, the author of ''Somerset Place Names'', the village was then known as ''Chew Millitus'', suggesting that it may have had some military potential. The name "Stoke", from the old English ''stoc'', meaning a stockade, may support that idea.<ref>{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Somerset Place Names |year=1992 |publisher=The Dovecote Press Ltd |location=Wimbourne |isbn=1874336032}}</ref> Little appears to have been written about this or subsequent periods in the history of the village.

===Bilbie family of bell and clockmakers===
{{Main|Bilbie family}}
[[Image:Cschurchbilbiebell.JPG|thumb|Bilbie bell kept in St Andrews Church as a memorial to the family]]
The Bilbie family of [[bellmaking|bell founders]] and clockmakers lived and worked in Chew Stoke for more than 200 years, from the late 1600s until the 1800s. They produced more than 1,350 church bells, which were hung in churches all over the [[West Country]]. Their oldest surviving bell, cast in 1698, is still giving good service in the local [[St Andrew's Church, Chew Stoke|St Andrew's Church]]. The earliest Bilbie clocks date from 1724 and are highly prized. They are mostly [[longcase clock]]s, the cheapest with 30-hour [[Movement (clockwork)|movements]] in modest oak cases, but some have high quality eight-day movements with additional features, such as showing the high tide at [[Bristol Harbour|Bristol docks]]. These latter clocks were fitted into quality [[Cabinet making|cabinet maker]] cases and command high prices.<ref>{{cite web | title=Bilbie <U+2013> Bell founders and clockmakers | work=Troyte Ringing Centre | url=http://www.troyteringingcentre.org.uk/bampton_bells.htm | accessdate=2006-11-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = Moore, J.

===Recent history===
In the 20th century, Chew Stoke expanded slightly with the influx of residents from the Chew Valley Lake area. These new residents were moved to Chew Stoke when the lake was created in the 1950s.<ref name="ross" /> In [[World War II]], 42 children and three teachers, who had been evacuated from Avenmore school in [[London]], were accommodated in the village.<ref name="hucker" /> On [[10 July]] [[1968]], torrential rainfall led to widespread flooding in the Chew Valley, and water reached the first floor of many buildings.<ref name="hucker" /> The damage in Chew Stoke was not as severe as in some of the surrounding villages, such as [[Pensford]]; however, fears that the [[Chew Valley Lake]] dam would be breached caused considerable anxiety.<ref>{{cite web | title=Memories of Bristol's Weather <U+2013> The Great Flood of 1968 | url=http://www.bristolhistory.com/?pageid=61234 | publisher = bristolhistory.com | accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://weldgen.tripod.com/the-great-flood-1968/index.html |title=The Great Flood of 1968 |accessdate=2007-10-29 |format= |work=Memories of Bristol }}</ref>

==Governance==
Chew Stoke has its own nine-member [[parish council]] with responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council<U+2019>s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and [[Neighbourhood Watch (UK)|neighbourhood watch]] groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chew-stoke.cx:8888/chewforum/forum_posts.asp?TID=2 |title= Chew Stoke Parish Council <U+2013> What we do|accessdate=2007-07-13 |format= |work=Chew Stoke Forums }}</ref>

The village is part of the [[Ward (politics)|ward]] of Chew Valley North in the [[unitary authority]] of Bath and North East Somerset, which has the wider responsibility for providing services such as education, refuse collection, and tourism. The ward is currently represented by [[Councillor]] Malcolm Hannay, a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/councilanddemocracy/councillorsdemocracyandelections/councillorsinformationandadvice/councillorscontactdetails.htm |title=Chew Valley North Councillor |accessdate=2007-07-13 |format= |work=Bath and North East Somerset Council }}</ref> It is also part of the [[Wansdyke (UK Parliament constituency)|Wansdyke constituency]], which will become [[North East Somerset (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Somerset]] at the next general election, and part of the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England constituency]] of the [[European Parliament]]. The sitting [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Wansdyke (UK Parliament constituency)|Wansdyke]] is [[Dan Norris]], a member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

The police service is provided by [[Avon and Somerset Constabulary]] with two [[Police Community Support Officer|Community Support Officer]] and one police officer covering the wider Chew Valley area. The [[Avon Fire and Rescue Service]] have a fire station at Chew Magna.

== Geography ==
[[Image:ChewStokeMap.jpg|thumb|left|Pictorial map of Chew Stoke]]
The area of Chew Stoke is surrounded by [[arable land]] and [[Dairy farming|dairy]]  farms on the floor of the [[Chew Valley]]. It is located along the Strode Brook tributary of the [[River Chew]], on the northwest side of the [[Chew Valley Lake]]. While much of the area has been cleared for farming, trees line the tributary and many of the roads. The village is built along the main thoroughfare, Bristol Road, which runs northeast to southwest. An older centre is located along Pilgrims Way, which loops onto Bristol Road and features an old stone [[packhorse bridge]]&mdash;now pedestrianised&mdash;and a 1950s [[Low water crossing|Irish bridge]], used as a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] in winter.<ref name="hucker"/> Houses line both of these roads, with residential cul-de-sacs and lanes extending from them.

Chew Stoke is approximately {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} south of [[Bristol]], {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} from [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} from [[Keynsham]]. It is {{convert|1.3|mi|km|1}} south of Chew Magna on the B3130 road that joins the [[A37 road|A37]] and [[A38 road|A38]]. The [[A368 road|A368]] crosses the valley west of the lake. The "Chew Valley Explorer" bus route 672/674, running from Bristol Bus Station to Cheddar, provides public transport access. This service is operated by Eurotaxis and subsidised by Bath and North East Somerset council.<ref>{{cite web | title=Chew Valley Explorer bus route 672/674 | work=BANES supported transport | url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/transportandroads/travel/buses/SupportedServices/ | accessdate=2006-01-04}}</ref> In 2002, a {{convert|1.9|mi|km|1|sing=on}} cycle route, the Chew Lake West Green Route, was opened around the western part of the lake from Chew Stoke. It forms part of the [[Padstow]] to Bristol West Country Way, [[National Cycle Network]] Route 3. It has all-weather surfacing, providing a smooth off-road facility for ramblers, mobility-challenged visitors, and cyclists of all abilities. Funding was provided by Bath and North East Somerset Council, with the support of [[Sustrans]] and the [[Chew Valley Recreational Trail Association]]. The minor roads around the lake are also frequently used by cyclists. [[Bristol International Airport]] is approximately {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} away, and the nearest train stations are [[Keynsham railway station|Keynsham]], [[Bath Spa railway station|Bath Spa]], and [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads]].

[[Image:Chewstokechurch.JPG|thumbnail|St Andrews Church, Chew Stoke]]

=== St Andrews Church ===
{{Main|St Andrews Church, Chew Stoke}}
St Andrews Church, a Grade II* listed building on the outskirts of Chew Stoke, was constructed in the 15th century and underwent extensive renovation in 1862.<ref>{{cite web | title=Church of St. Andrew | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/search/details.aspx?id=32965 | accessdate=2006-05-09}}</ref><ref name="pevsner">{{cite book | author = Pevsner, Nikolaus | year = 1958 | title = The Buildings of England: North Somerset and Bristol | publisher = Penguin Books | id=ISBN 0-300-09640-2 }}</ref> The inside of the church is decorated with 156 angels in wood and stone,<ref name="hucker" /> and the church includes a tower with an unusual spirelet on the staircase turret. In the tower hang [[Church bell|bells]] cast by the Bilbie family.<ref name="pevsner"/> 
The reconstructed Moreton Cross in the churchyard was moved there when Chew Valley Lake flooded,<ref name="ross" /> and the base of the cross shaft, about {{convert|80|ft|m|0}} southwest of the tower, is thought to date from the 14th century and is itself a Grade II* listed building,<ref>{{cite web | title=base of cross shaft | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/search/details.aspx?id=32968 | accessdate=2006-05-09}}</ref> as is the Webb monument in the churchyard.<ref>{{cite web | title=Webb monument | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/search/details.aspx?id=32967 | accessdate=2006-05-09}}</ref> The churchyard gate, at the southeast entrance, bears a lamp provided by public subscription to commemorate [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria's]] [[Golden Jubilee#Golden Jubilee for Queen Victoria|Jubilee]] of 1897 and is a Grade II listed structure.<ref>{{cite web | title=overthrow and gates | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/search/details.aspx?id=32966 | accessdate=2006-05-09}}</ref>

There is an unconfirmed story that this was given to the Gilbert family, then living at the court, by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;I]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Mason, Edmund J. & Mason, Doreen | year 1982 | title = Avon Villages | publisher = Robert Hale Ltd | id=ISBN 0-7091-9585-0 }}</ref>

=== Rectory ===
[[Image:Rectorychewstoke.JPG|thumb|left|The Old Rectory, south front with carvings of shields]]

The [[rectory]], at the end of Church Lane, opposite the church hall, is believed to have been built in 1529 by Sir John Barry, rector 1524&ndash;46. It has since undergone substantial renovations, including the addition of a clock tower for the Rev. W.P. Wait and further alterations c.1876 for Rev. J. Ellershaw. The clock tower has since been removed. The building has an ornate south front with carvings of shields bearing the coat of arms of the St Loe family, who were once chief landowners in the area, alone or impaled with arms of Fitzpane, Ancell, de la Rivere, and Malet. It is Grade II* listed.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Rectory | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/search/details.aspx?id=32964 | accessdate=2006-05-09}}</ref>

=== New rectory ===
[[Image:Oldrectory.JPG|thumb|The new rectory]]
The Reverend John Ellershaw built the new rectory in the 1870s. The last rector to occupy it was Lionel St Clair Waldy from 1907 to 1945. It was then bought by Douglas Wills, who donated it and the rectory field to [[Winford]] Hospital as a [[convalescent home]] for 16 children. It was later used as a nurses' home before being sold for private use.<ref name="hucker" /> 
It is now split into several residential units.<ref>{{cite web | title=Old Rectory | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/search/details.aspx?id=32963 | accessdate=2006-05-09}}</ref>

=== Grade II listed buildings ===
As with many cities and towns in the United Kingdom, the age of a number of the buildings in Chew Stoke, including the church, school, and several houses, reflects the long history of the village. For example, Chew Stoke Church [[Primary School]] has approximately 170 pupils between 4 and 11 years old. After the age of 11, most pupils attend [[Chew Valley School]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Chew Stoke Church Primary School | url=http://www.chewstoke.bathnes.sch.uk/| work=Chew Stoke Primary School | accessdate=2006-04-25}}</ref> These two buildings were constructed in 1858 by Samuel Burleigh Gabriel on the site of a former charity school founded in 1718. Additional classrooms were built in 1926, and further alterations and extensions were carried out in 1970.<ref>{{cite web | title=Chew Stoke School | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/search/details.aspx?id=32970 | accessdate=2006-05-09}}</ref>

An [[obelisk]] on Breach Hill Lane, dating from the early to mid-19th century, is said to have been built as a waterworks marker. It has a square limestone plinth about {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} high. The obelisk is about {{convert|32|ft|m|0}} high with a pyramidal top and small opening at the top on two sides.<ref>{{cite web | title=Obelisk, Breach Hill Lane | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/search/details.aspx?id=32961 | accessdate=2006-05-09}}</ref>

[[Image:Fairseats.JPG|left|thumb|Fairseat Farmhouse]]
The importance of farming is reflected in the age of many of the farmhouses. Rookery Farmhouse, in Breach Hill Lane, is dated at 1720, with later 18th-century additions to either side of the central rear wing.<ref>{{cite web | title=Rookery Farmhouse | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/search/details.aspx?id=32959 | accessdate=2006-05-09}}</ref> 
An attached [[stable]], {{convert|20|ft|m|0}} northeast of the farmhouse, is also a Grade II [[listed building]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Stable | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/search/details.aspx?id=32960 | accessdate=2006-05-09}}</ref>

Fairseat Farmhouse is from the 18th century and includes a plaque recording that [[John Wesley]] preached at the house on [[10 September]] [[1790]]. In August of that year, Fairseat Farmhouse was "registered among the records of this County as a House set apart for the worship of God and religious exercise for Protestant Dissenters."
