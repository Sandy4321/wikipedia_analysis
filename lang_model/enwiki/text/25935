'''Dengue fever''' ({{IPA-en|<U+02C8>d<U+025B><U+014B><U+0261>e<U+026A>|UK}}, {{IPA-en|<U+02C8>d<U+025B><U+014B><U+0261>i<U+02D0>|US}}), also known as '''breakbone fever''', is an acute [[fever|febrile]] infectious disease caused by the [[dengue virus]]. Typical symptoms include [[headache]], a [[petechial rash]], and [[myalgia|muscle]] and [[arthralgia|joint pains]]; in a small proportion the disease progresses to life-threatening complications such as '''dengue hemorrhagic fever''' (which may lead to severe [[hemorrhage]]) and '''dengue shock syndrome''' (where a [[Shock (circulatory)|very low blood pressure]] can cause organ dysfunction).

Dengue is usually transmitted by the [[mosquito]] ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'', and rarely ''[[Aedes albopictus]]''. The virus has four different [[serotypes]], and an infection with one usually gives lifelong [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to it, but only short-term immunity to the others. There is currently no available [[vaccine]], but outbreaks can be prevented by reducing the habitat and number of mosquitoes, and limiting exposure to bites.

Treatment of acute dengue is supportive, using either oral or intravenous [[rehydration]] for mild or moderate disease, and [[blood transfusion]]s for more severe cases. Rates of infection have increased dramatically over the last 50 years with around 50<U+2013>100&nbsp;million people infected yearly. A global disease, dengue is currently [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in more than 110&nbsp;countries with 2.5&nbsp;billion people living in areas where it is prevalent. Early descriptions of the condition date from 1779, and its viral cause and the transmission were elucidated in the early 20th century. Dengue has become a worldwide problem since the [[World War II|Second World War]].

== Classification ==
The [[World Health Organization]]'s 2009 classification divides dengue fever into two groups: uncomplicated and severe.<ref name=White10>{{cite journal |author=Whitehorn J, Farrar J |title=Dengue |journal=Br.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Infections from dengue virus range from asymptomatic, to a simple fever, to life threatening.<ref name=White10/> The [[incubation period]] (time between exposure and onset of symptoms) is 4<U+2013>10 days. Most infections are very mild, and many probably experience no symptoms at all.<ref name=White10/><ref name=WHOp14/> Children often experience symptoms similar to those of the [[common cold]] and [[gastroenteritis]] (vomiting and diarrhea).<ref name=India10>{{cite journal |author=Varatharaj A |title=Encephalitis in the clinical spectrum of dengue infection |journal=Neurol.

===Clinical course===
[[File:Dengue fever symptoms.svg|thumb|Schematic depiction of the symptoms of dengue fever.]]
The characteristic symptoms of dengue are: a sudden-onset [[fever]], [[headache]] (typically behind the eyes), [[myalgia|muscle]] and [[arthralgia|joint pains]], and a [[rash]]; the nickname "break-bone fever" comes from the associated muscle and joints pains.<ref name=White10/> The course of infection is classically divided into three phases: febrile, critical, and recovery.<ref name=WHOp25>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], pp.&nbsp;25<U+2013>27</ref>

The febrile phase involves high fevers, frequently over {{convert|40|C|F}} and associated with generalized pain and a headache; this usually lasts 2<U+2013>7&nbsp;days.<ref name=WHOp25/> [[erythema|Flushed skin]] and some [[petechia]] (point-like hemorrhages in the skin) may occur at this point<ref name=WHOp25/> as may some mild bleeding from [[mucous membranes]] of the mouth and nose.<ref name=Peads10/>

The critical phase, if it occurs, follows the resolution of the high fevers and typically lasts one to two days.<ref name=WHOp25/> During this phase there may be significant fluid accumulation in the [[thoracic cavity|thoracic]] and [[abdominal cavity]] due to increased [[Vascular permeability|capillary permeability]] and leakage. This leads to [[hypovolemia|depletion of fluid from the circulation]] and [[hypoperfusion|decreased blood supply to vital organs]].<ref name=WHOp25/> During this phase, organ dysfunction and severe [[bleeding]] (typically from the [[gastrointestinal tract]]) may occur.<ref name=Peads10/><ref name=WHOp25/> Shock and hemorrhage occurs in less than 5% of all cases of dengue<ref name=Peads10/> with those who have previously been infected with other [[serotype]]s of dengue at increased risk.<ref name=Peads10/><ref name=Life10/>

The recovery phase occurs next if the person survives with resorption of the leaked fluid.<ref name=WHOp25/> This resorption usually occurs over two to three days.<ref name=Peads10/> The improvement is often striking, but there may be severe [[pruritis|itching]] and a [[Bradycardia|slow heart rate]].<ref name=Peads10/><ref name=WHOp25/> It is during this stage that a fluid overload state may present with symptoms of [[cerebral edema]] such as an [[altered level of consciousness]] or [[seizures]].<ref name=Peads10/>

===Associated problems===
Dengue may occasional affect a number of other [[biological system|body systems]].<ref name=WHOp25/> This may be either in isolation or along with the classic dengue symptoms.<ref name=India10/>  A [[decreased level of consciousness]] may occur in 0.5<U+2014>6% of severe cases. This is thought to be due to [[encephalopathy]] (brain dysfunction) resulting from either disruption in the function of other organs (such as [[hepatic encephalopathy]] in liver involvement), or [[encephalitis]] (direct infection of the brain by the virus).<ref name=India10/>

A number of other neurological disorders has been reported in the context of dengue, such as [[transverse myelitis]] and [[Guillain-Barr<U+00E9> syndrome]].<ref name=India10/> [[Myocarditis]] (heart dysfunction due to infection of the heart muscle) and [[acute liver failure]] are among the rarer complications of dengue.<ref name=Peads10/><ref name=WHOp25/>

==Cause==
===Transmission===
[[File:Aedes aegypti biting human.jpg|alt=Close-up photograph of an Aedes aegypti mosquito biting human skin|thumb|The mosquito ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' feeding off a human host]]
Dengue virus is primarily transmitted by ''[[Aedes]]'' mosquitoes, particularly ''[[Aedes aegypti|A. aegypti]]''.<ref name=WHOp14>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], pp.&nbsp;14<U+2013>16</ref> These mosquitoes usually live between the [[latitudes]] of 35&nbsp;degrees&nbsp;North and 35&nbsp;degrees&nbsp;South below an [[elevation]] of {{convert|1000|m|ft}}.<ref name=WHOp14/> They bite primarily during the day.<ref name=WHOp59/> Other mosquito species<U+2014>''[[Aedes albopictus|A. albopictus]]'', ''[[Aedes polynesiensis|A polynesiensis]]'' and several ''[[Aedes scutellaris|A. scutellaris]]''<U+2014>may also transmit the disease.<ref name=WHOp14/> Humans are the primary [[Host (biology)|host]] of the virus.<ref name=WHOp14/> An infection may be acquired via a single bite.<ref name=Yellow10>{{cite web |url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2010/chapter-5/dengue-fever-dengue-hemorrhagic-fever.aspx |title=Chapter 5 <U+2013> Dengue Fever (DF) and Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) | work=2010 Yellow Book |author=Center for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=2010-12-23}}</ref> After taking a blood meal from an infected person, the virus infects the cells lining the mosquito's gut. About 8<U+2013>10 days later, the virus spreads to other tissues including the mosquito's [[salivary gland]]s and is subsequently released into its saliva. The virus seems to have no detrimental effect on the mosquito, which remains infected for life. ''Aedes aegypti'' prefers to lay its eggs in artificial water containers and tends to live in close proximity to humans, and has a preference for feeding off them rather than other vertebrates.<ref>[[#refGubler2010|Gubler (2010)]], pp.&nbsp;377<U+2013>78</ref>

Dengue may also be transmitted via infected [[blood products]] and through [[organ donation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wilder-Smith A, Chen LH, Massad E, Wilson ME |title=Threat of dengue to blood safety in dengue-endemic countries |journal=Emerging Infect.

=== Virology ===
{{Main|Dengue virus}}
[[Image:Dengue.jpg|thumb|alt=A transmission electron microscopy image showing dengue virus|A [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]] [[micrograph]] showing dengue virus [[virion]]s (the cluster of dark dots near the center).]]

Dengue fever virus (DENV) is a single positive-stranded [[RNA virus]] of the family ''[[Flaviviridae]]''; genus ''[[Flavivirus]]''. Its [[genome]] (genetic material) is about 11000 bases that codes for three structural proteins (C, prM and E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5), with short non-coding regions on both the 5' and 3' ends.<ref name=Life10>{{cite journal |author=Rodenhuis-Zybert IA, Wilschut J, Smit JM |title=Dengue virus life cycle: viral and host factors modulating infectivity |journal=Cell.

The severe complications on secondary infection seem to occur particularly if someone previously exposed to DENV-1 then contracts DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 then acquires DENV-2.<ref name=Guzman10/>

=== Predisposition ===
Severe disease is more common in babies and young children, and in contrast to many other infections it is more common in children that are relatively well nourished.<ref name=Peads10/> Women are more at risk than men.<ref name=Guzman10/> Dengue may be life-threatening in people with [[chronic disease]]s such as [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and [[asthma]].<ref name=Guzman10/>

It is thought that [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] (normal variations) in particular [[gene]]s may increase the risk of severe dengue complications. Examples include the genes coding for [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNF<U+03B1>]], [[mannan-binding lectin]],<ref name=White10/> [[CTLA4]], [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF<U+03B2>]],<ref name=Life10/> [[DC-SIGN]], and particular [[allele]]s of [[human leukocyte antigen]].<ref name=Guzman10/> [[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], a common genetic abnormality in Africans, appears to increase the risk.<ref name=Martina09>{{cite journal |author=Martina BE, Koraka P, Osterhaus AD |title=Dengue virus pathogenesis: an integrated view |journal=Clin.

== Mechanism ==
When a mosquito carrying DENV bites a person, the virus enters the skin with the mosquito's saliva. It encounters and binds to a number of different cells in the skin, such as [[keratinocyte]]s and [[Langerhans cell]]s (a population of [[dendritic cell]]s in the skin that identifies pathogens).<ref name=Martina09/> Entry into cells is by binding of viral proteins to [[membrane protein]]s, such as the [[C-type lectin]]s DC-SIGN, [[mannose receptor]] and [[CLEC5A]].<ref name=Life10/> DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, seems to be the main one.<ref name=Guzman10/> The virus then [[Receptor-mediated endocytosis|enters the cells]],<ref name=Life10/> and the dendritic cell moves to the nearest [[lymph node]]. Meanwhile, the virus genome is replicated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's [[endoplasmic reticulum]], where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins, and the viral RNA is copied. Immature virus particles are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the [[Golgi apparatus]], where the viral [[glycoprotein]]s are modified. Mature new viruses bud on the surface of the infected cell and are released by [[exocytosis]]. They then enter other white blood cells (such as [[monocyte]]s and [[macrophage]]s).<ref name=Life10/>

The initial reaction of infected cells is to produce the [[cytokine]] [[interferon]], which raises a number of defenses against viral infection through the [[innate immune system]] by augmenting the production of a large group of proteins (mediated by the [[JAK-STAT signaling pathway|JAK-STAT pathway]]). Some serotypes of DENV appear to have mechanisms to slow down this process. Interferon also activates the [[adaptive immune system]], which leads to the generation of [[antibody|antibodies]] against the virus as well as [[T cell]]s that directly attack any cell infected with the virus.<ref name=Life10/> Various antibodies are generated; some bind closely to the viral proteins and target them for [[phagocytosis]] (ingestion by [[phagocyte|specialized cells]]) and destruction, but some bind the virus less well and appear instead to deliver the virus into a part of the phagocytes where it is not destroyed but is able to duplicate further.<ref name=Life10/>

It is not entirely clear why secondary infection with a different strain of DENV places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that of [[antibody-dependent enhancement]] (ADE). The exact mechanism behind ADE is unclear. It may be caused by poor binding of non-neutralizing antibodies and delivery into the wrong compartment of phagocytes.<ref name=Life10/><ref name=Guzman10/> There is a suspicion that ADE is not the only mechanism underlying severe dengue-related complications,<ref name=White10/> and a role for low-avidity T cells and soluble factors (such as cytokines and the [[complement system]]) is implied by various lines of research.<ref name=Martina09/>

Severe disease is marked by two problems: dysfunction of [[endothelium]] (the cells that line blood vessels) and disordered [[coagulation]] (blood clotting).<ref name=India10/> Endothelial dysfunction leads to the leakage of fluid from the blood vessels into the chest and abdominal cavities, while coagulation disorder is responsible for the bleeding complications. Higher levels of virus in the blood and involvement of other organs (such as the [[bone marrow]] and the [[liver]]) are associated with more severe disease. Cells in the affected organs die, leading to the release of cytokines and activation of both coagulation and [[fibrinolysis]] (the opposing systems of blood clotting and clot degradation). These alterations together lead to both endothelial dysfunction and coagulation disorder.<ref name=Martina09/>

|}

The diagnosis of dengue is typically made clinically, on the basis of reported symptoms and [[physical examination]]; this applies especially in endemic areas.<ref name=White10/> Early disease can however be difficult to differentiate from other [[viral infections]].<ref name=Peads10/> A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following: [[nausea]] and vomiting, rash, generalized pains, [[Leukopenia|low white blood cell count]], positive [[tourniquet test]], or any warning sign (see table) in someone who lives in an [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] area.<ref name=WHOp10/> Warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe dengue.<ref name=WHOp25/> The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available, involves the application of a [[Sphygmomanometer|blood pressure cuff]] for five minutes, followed by the counting of any petechial hemorrhages; a higher number makes a diagnosis of dengue more likely.<ref name=WHOp25/> Often, investigations are performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as [[malaria]], [[leptospirosis]], [[typhoid fever]], and [[meningococcal disease]].<ref name=Peads10/>

The earliest change detectable on laboratory investigations is a low white blood cell count, which may then be followed by [[Thrombocytopenia|low platelets]] and [[metabolic acidosis]].<ref name=Peads10/> Plasma leakage may result in [[hemoconcentration]] (as indicated by a rising [[hematocrit]]) and [[hypoalbuminemia]].<ref name=Peads10/> [[Pleural effusion]]s or [[ascites]] may be detected on clinical examination when large,<ref name=Peads10/> but the demonstration of fluid on [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] may assist in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome.<ref name=White10/><ref name=Peads10/> The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings.<ref name=White10/>

===Virology and serology===
Dengue fever may also be diagnosed by microbiological laboratory testing.<ref name=WHOp10/> This can be done by virus isolation in [[cell culture]]s, [[Nucleic acid test|nucleic acid detection]] by [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], viral [[antigen]] detection or specific [[antibodies]] (serology).<ref name=Guzman10/><ref name=WHOp90>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], pp.&nbsp;90<U+2013>95</ref> Virus isolation and nucleic acid detection are more accurate than antigen detection, but these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost.<ref name=WHOp90/> All tests may be negative in the early stages of the disease.<ref name=Peads10/><ref name=Guzman10/>

Apart from serology, laboratory test are only of diagnostic value during the acute phase of the illness. Tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies, types [[IgG]] and [[IgM]], can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection. Both IgG and IgM are produced after 5<U+2013>7 days. The highest levels (titres) of IgM are detected following a primary infection, but IgM is also produced in secondary and tertiary infections. The IgM becomes undetectable 30<U+2013>90 days after a primary infection, but earlier following re-infections. IgG, by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past infection. After a primary infection the IgG reaches peak levels in the blood after 14<U+2013>21 days. In subsequent re-infections levels peak earlier and the titres are usually higher. Both IgG and IgM provide protective immunity to the infecting [[serovar|serotype]] of the virus. In the laboratory test the IgG and the IgM antibodies can cross-react with other flaviviruses, such as [[yellow fever|yellow fever virus]], which can make the interpretation of the serology difficult.<ref name=Guzman10/><ref name=Gubler10/> The detection of IgG alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than four-fold increase in levels of specific IgG is detected. In a person with symptoms, the detection of IgM is considered diagnostic.<ref name=Gubler10>[[#refGubler2010|Gubler (2010)]], p.&nbsp;380</ref>

== Prevention ==
[[Image:Vector Control.jpg|alt=A black and white photograph of people filling in a ditch with standing water|thumb|A 1920s photograph of efforts to disperse standing water and thus decrease mosquito populations.]]
There are currently no approved [[vaccine]]s for the dengue virus.<ref name=White10/> Prevention thus depends on control of and protection from the bites of the mosquito that transmits it.<ref name=WHOp59>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], pp.&nbsp;59<U+2013>60</ref><ref name=WHOp137>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], p.&nbsp;137</ref> The World Health Organization recommends a Integrated Vector Control program consisting of five elements: (1)&nbsp;Advocacy, social mobilization and legislation to ensure that public health bodies and communities are strengthened, (2)&nbsp;collaboration between the health and other sectors (public and private), (3)&nbsp;an integrated approach to disease control to maximize use of resources, (4)&nbsp;evidence-based decision making to ensure any interventions are targeted appropriately and (5)&nbsp;capacity-building to ensure an adequate response to the local situation.<ref name=WHOp59/>

The primary method of controlling ''Ae. aegypti'' is by eliminating its [[habitat]]s.<ref name=WHOp59/> This may be done by emptying containers of water or by adding [[insecticide]]s or [[biological control agent]]s to these areas.<ref name=WHOp59/> Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative health effect from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents.<ref name=WHOp59/> People may prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin and/or the application of [[insect repellent]] ([[DEET]] being the most effective).<ref name=Yellow10/> A number of novel methods have been used to reduce mosquito numbers with some success including the placement of the fish ''[[Poecilia reticulata]]'' or [[copepods]] in standing water to eat the mosquito larva.<ref name=WHOp71>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], p.&nbsp;71</ref>

There are ongoing programs working on a dengue vaccine to cover all four serotypes.<ref name=WHOp137>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]] p. 137</ref> One of the concerns is that a vaccine may increase the risk of severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement.<ref name=Webster>{{cite journal |author=Webster DP, Farrar J, Rowland-Jones S |title=Progress towards a dengue vaccine |journal=Lancet Infect Dis |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=678<U+2013>87 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19850226 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70254-3}}</ref> The ideal vaccine is safe, effective after one or two injections, covers all serotypes, does not contribute to ADE, is easily transported and stored, and is both affordable and cost-effective.<ref name=Webster/> A number of vaccines are currently undergoing testing.<ref name=Guzman10/><ref name=Webster/><ref name=Barrett09>{{cite book |author=Barrett AD, Stanberry LR |title=Vaccines for biodefense and emerging and neglected diseases |publisher=Academic |location=San Diego |year=2009 |pages=287<U+2013>323 |isbn=0-12-369408-6 | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6Nu058ZNa1MC&pg=PA289}}</ref>  It is hoped that the first products will be commercially available by 2015.<ref name=WHOp137/>

== Management ==
There are no specific treatments for the dengue fever virus.<ref name=White10/> Treatment depends on the symptoms, and may vary from advice to drink plenty of fluids such as [[oral rehydration solution]] at home with close follow up, to admission to hospital for carefully titrated [[Isotonic solutions|isotonic]] [[intravenous fluids]] and/or [[blood transfusions]].<ref name=WHOp32>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], pp.&nbsp;32<U+2013>37</ref> A decision for hospital admission is typically based on the presence or absence of the "warning signs" listed above, and the presence of preexisting health conditions.<ref name=Peads10/>

Intravenous fluids if used are usually only needed for one or two days.<ref name=WHOp32/> Fluids are titrated to a [[Urination|urinary output]] of 0.5<U+2013>1&nbsp;mL/kg/hr, stable [[vital sign]]s and normalization of [[hematocrit]].<ref name=Peads10/> Procedures that increase bleeding risk such as [[nasogastric tube]]s, [[intramuscular injection]]s and arterial punctures are avoided.<ref name=Peads10/> [[Acetaminophen]] may be used for fever and discomfort while [[NSAIDs]] such as [[ibuprofen]] or [[aspirin]] are avoided due to an increased bleeding risk.<ref name=WHOp32/> The need for blood tranfusions is based on the presence of unstable [[vital signs]] and a decreasing haematocrit rather than the usual haematocrit of less than 30% used in [[sepsis]].<ref name=WHOp40>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], pp.&nbps;40<U+2013>43</ref> [[Packed red blood cells]] or [[whole blood]] are recommended, while [[platelet]]s and [[fresh frozen plasma]] are usually not.<ref name=WHOp40/> 

During the recovery phase intravenous fluids are discontinued to prevent a state of [[Hypervolemia|fluid overload]].<ref name=Peads10/> If fluid overload occurs and vitals are stable stopping further fluid may be all that is needed.<ref name=WHOp40/> If a person is outside of the critical phase, the [[loop diuretic]] [[furosemide]] may be used to eliminate excess fluid from the circulation.<ref name=WHOp40/>

The [[disease burden|burden of disease]] from dengue is estimated to be similar to other childhood and tropical diseases, such as [[tuberculosis]], at 1600 [[disability-adjusted life year]]s per million population.<ref name=Guzman10/> It is the most common viral disease transmitted by [[arthropod]]s.<ref name=Life10/> As a tropical disease it is deemed only second in importance to [[malaria]].<ref name=Peads10/> While once exclusively a [[tropical disease]] it has become global, and is [[endemic]] in more than 110 countries.<ref name=Peads10/> The World Health Organization counts dengue as one of sixteen [[neglected diseases|neglected tropical diseases]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Neglected Tropical Diseases | url=http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/en/ |title=Diseases covered by NTD Department  |work=World Health Organization |accessdate=2010-12-27}}</ref>

The incidence of dengue increased 30&nbsp;fold between 1960 and 2010.<ref name=WHOp3>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], p.&nbsp;3</ref> This increase is believed to be due to a combination of urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and [[global warming]].<ref name=White10/> The geographical distribution is around the equator with 70% of the total 2.5&nbsp;billion people living in endemic areas from Asia and the Pacific.<ref name=WHOp3/> In the United States, the rate of dengue infection among those who return from an endemic area with a fever is 2.9<U+2013>8.0%.<ref name=Yellow10/>

Until 2003, dengue was classified as a potential [[bioterrorism]] agent, but subsequent reports removed this classification as it was deemed too difficult to transfer and only caused [[hemorrhagic fever]] in a relatively small proportion of people.<ref name=Barrett09/>

== History ==
=== Etymology ===
The origins of the word "dengue" are not clear, but one theory is that it is derived from the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] phrase ''Ka-dinga pepo'', which describes the disease as being caused by an [[evil spirit]].<ref name=EID06/> The Swahili word ''dinga'' may possibly have its origin in the Spanish word ''dengue'' meaning fastidious or careful, which would describe the gait of a person suffering the bone pain of dengue fever.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=dengue |title=Etymology: dengue |year=2001 |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |author=Harper D| accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref> Alternatively, the use of the Spanish word may derive from the similar-sounding Swahili.<ref name=EID06>{{cite journal |title = Etymologia: dengue |journal=Emerg. Infec. Dis. |year=2006 |volume=12 |page=893 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol12no06/pdfs/etymology.pdf |format=PDF |issue=6}}</ref> Slaves in the West Indies who contracted dengue were said to have the posture and gait of a [[dandy]], and the disease was known as "dandy fever".<ref>{{cite web |author=Anonymous | url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6620 |title=Definition of Dandy fever |work=MedicineNet.com |date= 1998-06-15| accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref><ref name=Hal08>{{cite book |author=Halstead, Scott B. |title=Dengue (Tropical Medicine: Science and Practice) |publisher=Imperial College Press |location=River Edge, N.J |year=2008 |pages=1<U+2013>10 |isbn=1-84816-228-6 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6zLd9mFwxwsC&pg=PA1}}</ref>

The term "break-bone fever" was first applied by physician and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] [[Benjamin Rush]], in a 1789 report of the 1780 epidemic in [[Philadelphia]]. In the report he uses primarily the more formal term "bilious remitting fever".<ref name=Barrett09/><ref>{{cite book | author=Rush AB | year=1789 | chapter=An account of the bilious remitting fever, as it appeared in Philadelphia in the summer and autumn of the year 1780 | title=Medical enquiries and observations | pages=104<U+2013>117 | publisher=Prichard and Hall | location=Philadelphia, Pa.}}</ref> The term dengue fever only came into general use after 1828.<ref name=Hal08/> Other historical terms include "breakheart fever" and "la dengue".<ref name=Hal08/> Terms for severe disease include: infectious thrombocytopenic purpura and Philippine, Thai, or Singapore hemorrhagic fever.<ref name=Hal08/>

=== Discovery ===
The first record of a case of probable dengue fever is in a Chinese medical encyclopedia from the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265<U+2013>420 AD) which referred to a "water poison" associated with flying insects.<ref name=EID06/><ref name=Gubler98>{{cite journal |author=Gubler DJ |title=Dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever |journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev. |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=480<U+2013>96 |year=1998 |month=July |pmid=9665979 |pmc=88892|url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/11/3/480}}</ref> There have been descriptions of epidemics in the 17th century, but the most plausible early reports of dengue epidemics are from 1779 and 1780, when an epidemic swept Asia, Africa and North America.<ref name=Gubler98/> From that time until 1940, epidemics were infrequent.<ref name=Gubler98/>

In 1906, transmission by the ''Aedes'' mosquitoes was confirmed, and in 1907 dengue was the second disease (after [[yellow fever]]) that was shown to be caused a virus.<ref name=Henchal>{{cite journal |author=Henchal EA, Putnak JR |title=The dengue viruses |journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev. |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=376<U+2013>96 |year=1990 |month=October |pmid=2224837 |pmc=358169 |doi= |url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/3/4/376 | format=PDF}}</ref> Further investigations by [[John Burton Cleland]] and [[Joseph Franklin Siler]] completed the basic understanding of dengue transmission.<ref name=Henchal/>

The marked rise of spread of dengue during and after the [[World War II|Second World War]] has been attributed to ecologic disruption. The same trends also led to the spread of different serotypes of the disease to different areas, and the emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever, which was first reported in the [[Philippines]] in 1953. In the 1970s, it became a major cause of [[child mortality]]. Around the same time it emerged in the Pacific and the Americas, and the epidemic has been spreading since then.<ref name=Gubler98/>
