'''Theoktiste''' ({{lang-el|<U+0398><U+03B5><U+03BF><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03AF><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03B7>}}), also known as '''Phlorina''' (<U+03A6><U+03BB><U+03CE><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BD><U+03B1>), was the mother of the 9th-century [[Byzantine empress]] [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Theodora]], the wife of Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]].

==Life==
Theoktiste Phlorina was the spouse of Marinos, an officer in the [[Byzantine army]] with the rank of ''[[tourmarches]]'' or ''[[droungarios]]''.{{sfn|Guilland|1971|p=273}} The family lived, or hailed, from the town of Ebissa in [[Paphlagonia]].{{sfn|Winkelmann|Lilie|Ludwig|Pratsch|2001|p=570}} Some modern genealogists, including [[Cyril Toumanoff]] and [[Nicholas Adontz]], have suggested that Marinos hailed from the Armenian noble clan of the [[Mamikonian]]. According to Nina Garso<U+00EF>an in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]'', however, "[a]ttractive though it is, this thesis cannot be proven for want of sources."{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=1279}}

With Marinos, Theoktiste had two sons, [[Bardas]] and [[Petronas (general)|Petronas]], and four daughters, [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Theodora]], Sophia, Maria and Irene.{{sfn|Winkelmann|Lilie|Ludwig|Pratsch|2001|p=570}}{{sfn|Guilland|1971|p=274}} In 821 or 830 (the date is disputed), Theodora married [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]], who in 829 succeeded his father [[Michael II the Amorian]] (ruled 820<U+2013>829) as [[Byzantine emperor|emperor]]. With her daughter's coronation as empress, Theoktiste too was honoured with the exalted title of ''[[zoste patrikia]]''.{{sfn|Guilland|1971|p=273}}{{sfn|Winkelmann|Lilie|Ludwig|Pratsch|2001|p=570}} At about the same time she bought a mansion in [[Constantinople]], in the quarter of [[Psamathia]], from the ''[[patrikios]]'' Niketas, which became her residence.{{sfn|Guilland|1971|p=273}}{{sfn|Winkelmann|Lilie|Ludwig|Pratsch|2001|p=570}}

Unlike her son-in-law Theophilos, who was an ardent [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|iconoclast]],{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=2066}} Theoktiste was reportedly an [[iconodule]]. Not only did she aid persecuted iconodules, but when Theodora's five daughters visited her in her house, she would instruct them in the veneration of the [[icon]]s, much to the anger of Theophilos, who forbade his daughters from visiting their grandmother too often.{{sfn|Winkelmann|Lilie|Ludwig|Pratsch|2001|p=570}}{{sfn|Guilland|1971|p=274}} Her house was later<U+2014>possibly still during Theophilos' reign (829<U+2013>842)<U+2014>transformed into the [[Gastria Monastery]]. Theoktiste and Theodora, as well as other members of the family, were buried there.{{sfn|Winkelmann|Lilie|Ludwig|Pratsch|2001|p=570}}{{sfn|Guilland|1971|p=273}}

Of her other children, Bardas and Petronas would go on to become major figures in the reign of Theodora and Theophilos's son, [[Michael III]] (r. 842<U+2013>867), Sophia married the ''[[magistros]]'' Constantine Baboutzikos, Maria, also known as Kalomaria ("Maria the Beautiful") married the ''patrikios'' and later ''magistros'' Arsaber, while Irene married the ''patrikios'' Sergios, either the brother or the maternal uncle of the future [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Photios]].{{sfn|Guilland|1971|p=274}}
