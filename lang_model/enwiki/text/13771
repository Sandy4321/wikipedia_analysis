'''Frances Elizabeth Lupton''' (n<U+00E9>e '''Greenhow'''; 20 July 1821 <U+2013> 9 March 1892) was an [[English people|English]]woman of the [[Victorian era]] who worked to open up [[Female education#Modern period|educational opportunities for women]]. She married into the politically active [[Lupton family]] of [[Leeds]], a large city in the [[Northern England|North of England]], where she co-founded [[Leeds Girls' High School]] in 1876.

In 1847 Frances married Francis Lupton (1813-1884), a member of a prosperous and politically active cloth manufacturing family in [[Leeds]]. In addition to his business interests, he was one of the founders of the Yorkshire College of Science in 1874,<ref>{{cite book|last=Shimmin|first=Arnold Nixon|title=The University of Leeds: The First Half-Century|year=1954|publisher=University Press for the University of Leeds|page=103|url=http://books.google.co.za/books/about/The_University_of_Leeds.html?id=cmpXAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y}}</ref> which later became part of the federal [[Victoria University (UK)|Victoria University]], and from 1904 the [[University of Leeds]]. [[Lupton family|The Luptons]] were, like the Martineaus, a family of Unitarians. They worshipped at the [[Mill Hill Chapel]] on [[Leeds City Square]], where a [[stained glass]] window commemorates the family.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mill Hill Unitarian Chapel History|url=http://www.millhillchapel.org.uk/chapel_history.htm|publisher=Mill Hill Chapel|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref>

Frances had married into a family of activists <U+2013> her husband's younger brother, Joseph, for example, was a committed [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade|anti-slavery campaigner]]. He was a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and sat on the executive of the [[National Reform Union]]. He also supported the struggle for [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] and sat on the committee of the Manchester National Society (for Women's Suffrage).<ref>{{cite book|last=Crawford|first=Elizabeth|title=The Women's Suffrage Movement in Britain and Ireland: A Regional Survey|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9781136010620|url=http://books.google.co.za/books?id=8uoe5GSopaUC&}}</ref>

==Female education reform==
===Context===
[[Female education#Modern period|Secular education of women]] had become a more pressing issue by the middle of the nineteenth century. Girls' schools, including small boarding establishments, had existed for generations (for example [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s school in the 1780s, with ties to [[Newington Green Unitarian Church|its nearby Unitarian chapel]], or the [[Newington Academy for Girls]], set up by [[Quakers]] in 1824), but a new impetus was given by the founding of colleges offering single-sex education to young women. One example, [[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]], opened in London in 1848, originally to provide qualifications for [[governess]]es. The first girls' schools targeted at university entrance were [[North London Collegiate School]] (from 1850) and [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]] (from the appointment of [[Dorothea Beale]] in 1858).<ref>{{cite book|editor=Walford, Geoffrey|title=The Private Schooling of Girls: Past and Present|year=1993|publisher=Woburn Press|location=London|year=1993|pages=9<U+2013>32|isbn=9780713001860|url=http://books.google.co.za/books/about/The_Private_Schooling_of_Girls.html?id=kmqD1vFxDgMC&redir_esc=y}}</ref> [[Emily Davies]] campaigned for women's [[higher education]] in the 1860s, and founded [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton]] in 1869, and [[Anne Clough]] founded [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]] in 1875 <U+2013> both of these colleges were affiliated with but not entirely accepted by the [[University of Cambridge]].

Lupton's aunt Harriet Martineau paid a long visit to the United States in 1834, one of her areas of interest being the [[Women in education in the United States|emerging girls' schools]]. In ''Society in America'' (1837), the sociologist angrily criticized the state of female education:
<blockquote>"The intellect of women is confined by an unjustifiable restriction of ... education ... As women have none of the objects in life for which an enlarged education is considered requisite, the education is not given ... The choice is to either be ill-educated, passive, and subservient, or well-educated, vigorous, and free only upon sufferance."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Postlethwaite|first=Diana|title=Mothering and Mesmerism in the Life of Harriet Martineau|year=1989|journal=Signs|volume=14|issue=3|date=Spring 1989|pages=583<U+2013>609|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|jstor=3174403|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3174403}}</ref></blockquote>

===Lupton's impact===
<!-- This section contains a summary of the ODNB article on Frances Elizabeth Lupton -->
Lupton's entry in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' describes her pioneering work in [[Female education#Educational reform|expanding the opportunities for female education]].<ref name=ONDB/>

In 1871 Lupton became Honorary Secretary to the Ladies<U+2019> Honorary Council of the Yorkshire Board of Education, which was then just six years old. She was "the powerful driving force of the organization" and also that of the Leeds Ladies' Educational Association. One of her first successes was setting up a students' library. Soon, the committees had arranged to superintend the first [[UCLES|Cambridge Local Examination]] for women in Leeds.<ref name=ONDB/><ref name=Unitarians/>

However, the most pressing need was for better all-round education for girls, equivalent to what boys received at traditional academic [[grammar school]]. Established interests prevented the use of existing charitable funds, despite the passage of the [[Endowed Schools Act 1869]], so Lupton led a meeting between the Leeds Association and the Ladies Council to create a new way forward <U+2013> a [[joint-stock company|joint stock company]]. Her business acumen led to the establishment of [[Leeds Girls' High School]] in 1876.<ref name=ONDB/><ref name=Unitarians>{{cite web|title=Kate Middleton <U+2013> a Unitarian 'Who Do You Think You Are'|url=http://www.unitarian.org.uk/info/news-middleton.shtml|publisher=The General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches (Great Britain)|accessdate=23 July 2013}}</ref>

Lupton and the Ladies Council also saw the need for the dissemination of practical information on traditionally female subjects such as health and nursing. They launched a cookery school in 1874, having requested but not received help from civil servant Sir [[Henry Cole]]. In the following decade, the Yorkshire Training School of Cookery developed [[teacher education|teacher training]] courses at the request of the school boards <U+2013> eventually this formed a component of [[Leeds Metropolitan University]].<ref name=ONDB/><ref name=Unitarians/>

==Death==
Lupton died at home on 9 March 1892 and is buried at St John's Church in Roundhay.<ref name=Camilla/><ref>{{cite web|title=St John's Burial Register 1827<U+2013>1921|url=http://www.stjohnsroundhay.co.uk/burial1827-1921.html|accessdate=23 July 2013}}</ref>
