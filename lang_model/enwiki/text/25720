'''State Route 173''' (SR 173) runs from [[State Route 138 (California)|State Route 138]] near the west end of [[Silverwood Lake]] in the Summit Valley south of [[Hesperia, California|Hesperia]] to [[State Route 18 (California)|State Route 18]] south of [[Lake Arrowhead, California|Lake Arrowhead]], USA. It is the only California state highway with an [[unpaved]] segment, which is a one-lane jeep trail on the Northwestern face of the San Bernardino Mountains directly east of [[Summit Valley]] and northwest of [[Blue Jay]]. The route starts at the Mojave River Forks, skims the easterly and southerly sides of Lake Arrowhead and meets [[State Route 189 (California)|State Route 189]], Lake's Edge Road, at the south entrance to the Lake Arrowhead mall. The route runs entirely in [[San Bernardino County]], mostly in the [[San Bernardino National Forest]].  Although the jeep trail portion of the road is not barricaded, it has been officially closed by Caltrans since the 2003 Willow Fire.

==Route description==
SR 173 is eligible for inclusion in the [[State Scenic Highway System (California)|State Scenic Highway System]]<ref name="scenic"> [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=shc&group=00001-01000&file=260-284 CA Codes (shc:260-284)]</ref>. However, it has not been designated by [[Caltrans]] as a scenic highway.<ref name="actualscenic">[[California Department of Transportation]], [http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LandArch/scenic/schwy.htm Officially Designated Scenic Highways], accessed 2010-03-26</ref>

SR 173 begins at [[SR 138 (CA)|SR 138]] just inside the [[Hesperia, California|Hesperia]] city limits and travels east along the shore of [[Silverwood Lake]], passing near [[Cedar Springs Dam]]. The road briefly turns north further into the Hesperia city limits, leaving the [[San Bernardino National Forest]]. SR 173 leaves the city and enters [[Mojave River Forks Regional Park]], where it turns east and intersects Arrowhead Lake Road, which leads to the urban center of Hesperia. Once SR 173 intersects the [[Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail]], it turns into a dirt road, first heading east before turning south to the [[Lake Arrowhead, California|Lake Arrowhead]] area. A few miles from Lake Arrowhead, SR 173 becomes paved and enters the community of [[Cedar Glen, California|Cedar Glen]], where it parallels the [[Lake Arrowhead]] shoreline and encounters [[Papoose Lake]. The highway enters the community of Lake Arrowhead, where SR 173 intersects [[SR 189 (CA)|SR 189]] and turns south to terminate at [[SR 18 (CA)|SR 18]].<ref name="sbdtg">{{cite map|year=2008|title=San Bernardino County Road Atlas|publisher=Thomas Brothers}}</ref>

==History==
{{expand-section}}
Before 1964, Route 173 was part of California Legislative Route 59; however, like a small number of other California State highways, it was not signed.  From 1934 to the mid 1950s the part of Route 59 that is now Route 173 was designated by the California Division of Highways to be a segment of California sign route 2; however, signing did not occur.  From the mid 1950s through July of 1964, the Division of Highways changed the routing of future sign route 2 from the subject segment of Route 59 to Legislative Route 188, the segment of present [[State Route 138 (California)|California 138]] between the junction of Routes 138 and 173 and Mount Anderson Junction, the junction of Routes 18 and 138 south of [[Crestline, California|Crestline]].

==Major intersections==
:Note: Except where prefixed with a letter, [[postmile]]s were measured in 1964, based on the alignment as it existed at that time, and do not necessarily reflect current mileage.
The entire route is in [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]].
