The '''Red Rail''' (''Aphanapteryx bonasia'') is an [[extinct]], [[flightless]] [[Rallidae|rail]]. It was [[endemic]] to the [[Mascarene]] island of [[Mauritius]], east of [[Madagascar]] in the [[Indian Ocean]]. It had a close relative on [[Rodrigues]] island, the likewise extinct [[Rodrigues Rail]], with which it is sometimes considered [[Conspecificity|congeneric]]. Its relationship with other rails is unclear. Rails often evolve flightlessness when adapting to isolated islands, free of mammalian predators. 

The Red Rail was a little larger than a chicken and had reddish, hairlike plumage, with dark legs and a long, curved beak. The wings were small, and its legs were slender for a bird of its size. It was similar to the Rodrigues Rail, but was larger, and had proportionally shorter wings. It was also reminiscent of a [[Kiwi]] and a [[Limpkin]]. It is believed to have fed on [[invertebrates]], and snail shells have been found with damage matching an attack by its beak. Human hunters took advantage of an attraction Red Rails had to red objects by using coloured cloth to lure birds the birds so that they could be beaten with sticks.

Until [[subfossil]] remains were described in 1869, scientists only knew the Red Rail from 17th century descriptions and illustrations. These were thought to represent several different species, which resulted in a large number of invalid [[junior synonyms]]. It has been suggested that all late 17th century accounts of the [[Dodo]] actually referred to the Red Rail, after the former had become extinct. The last mention of a Red Rail sighting is from 1693, and it is thought to have gone extinct around 1700, due to predation by humans and [[introduced species]].

The Red Rail was long known only from a few contemporary descriptions referring to red "hens" and names otherwise used for [[grouse]] or [[partridges]] in Europe, as well as the sketches of [[Pieter van den Broecke]] and [[Sir Thomas Herbert]] from 1617 and 1634. These were thought to depict separate species of birds by some authors, but were regarded as one by [[Hugh Edwin Strickland]] in 1848.<ref name="Strickland">{{cite book

In the 1860s, subfossil foot bones and a lower jaw were found along with remains of other Mauritian animals in the [[Mare aux Songes]] swamp, and were described by [[Alphonse Milne-Edwards]] in 1869, who identified them as belonging to a rail. He also determined they belonged to the birds in the 17th century descriptions and illustrations. Milne-Edwards combined the [[genus]] name of ''Aphanapteryx imperialis'', which had been coined the previous year by [[Georg Ritter von Frauenfeld]] for the Hoefnagel painting, with the older specific name ''broecki''.<ref name="Milne-Edwards"/> Due to [[nomenclatural priority]], the genus name was later combined with the oldest species name ''bonasia'', which was coined by [[Edmond de S<U+00E9>lys Longchamps]] in 1848.<ref>{{Citation

Some early accounts refer to Red Rails by the vernacular names for the [[Hazel Grouse]], ''Tetrastes bonasia'', so the name evidently originates there. The name itself perhaps refers to ''bonasus'', meaning "bull" in Latin, or ''bonum'' and ''assum'', meaning "good roast". It has also been suggested to be a Latin form of the French word ''bonasse'', meaning simple-minded or good-natured.<ref name="OlsonB"/>

More fossils were later found by Theodore Sauzier, who had been commissioned to explore the "historical souvenirs" of Mauritius in 1889.<ref name="Newton & Gadow">{{Cite doi|10.1111/j.1469-7998.1893.tb00001.x}}</ref> Around the end of the 19th century, a complete specimen was found by the barber Louis Etienne Thirioux, who also found important Dodo remains.<ref name="Extinct Birds"/>

===Evolution===
Apart from being a close relative of the [[Rodrigues Rail]], the relationships of the Red Rail are uncertain. The two are commonly kept as separate genera, ''Aphanapteryx'' and ''Erythromachus'', but have also been united as species of ''Aphanapteryx'' at times.<ref name="Lost Land"/> They were first generically synonymised by [[Edward Newton]] and [[Albert G<U+00FC>nther]] in 1879, due to skeletal similarities.<ref name="G<U+00FC>nther& Newton">{{Cite doi|10.1098/rstl.1879.0043}}</ref> Based on geographic location and the morphology of the [[nasal bones]], it has been suggested that they were related to the genera ''[[Gallirallus]]'', ''[[Dryolimnas]]'', ''[[Atlantisia]]'', and ''[[Rallus]]''.<ref name="OlsonB"/> Rails have reached many oceanic [[archipelagos]], which has frequently lead to speciation and evolution of flightlessness.<ref name="Lost Land"/>

==Description==
[[File:Aphanapteryx bonasia.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=drawing of Red Rail|1601 sketches of a hunted specimen attributed to Joris Joostensz Laerle]]
From the subfossil bones, illustrations and descriptions, it is known that the Red Rail was a flightless bird, somewhat larger than a chicken. Subfossil specimens range in size, which may indicate [[sexual dimorphism]], as is common among rails.<ref name="OlsonB"/> Its exact length is unknown, but the pelvis was 60&nbsp;mm (2.3&nbsp;in) in length, the femur was 69<U+2013>71&nbsp;mm (2.7<U+2013>2.8&nbsp;in), the tibia was 98<U+2013>115&nbsp;mm (3.8<U+2013>4.5), the [[tarsometatarsus]] was 79&nbsp;mm (3.1&nbsp;in), and the humerus was 60<U+2013>66&nbsp;mm (2.3<U+2013>2.6&nbsp;in).<ref name="Newton & Gadow"/> Its plumage was reddish brown all over, and the [[feather]]s were fluffy and hairlike; the tail was not visible in the living bird and the short wings likewise also nearly disappeared in the [[plumage]].<ref name="Fuller Extinct"/> It had a long, slightly curved, brown [[beak|bill]], and some illustrations suggest it had a [[nape]] crest.<ref name="Extinct Birds"/> It perhaps resembled a lightly built [[Kiwi]], and it has also been likened to a [[Limpkin]], both in appearance and behaviour.<ref name="Lost Land"/><ref name="Fuller Extinct">{{cite book

The [[sternum]] and [[humerus]] were small, indicating that it had lost the power of flight. Its legs were long and slender for such a large bird, but the pelvis was compact and stout.<ref name="Newton & Gadow"/> It differed from the Rodrigues Rail, its closest relative, in having a proportionately shorter humerus, a narrower and longer skull, and having shorter and higher nostrils. They differed considerably in plumage, based on early descriptions.<ref name="OlsonB"/> The Red Rail was also larger, with somewhat smaller wings, but their leg proportions were similar.<ref name="G<U+00FC>nther& Newton"/> The [[pelvis]] and [[sacrum]] was also similar.<ref name="Newton & Gadow"/>

===Contemporary accounts===
[[File:Red Rail.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=painting of Red Rail|Painting of a possibly stuffed specimen attributed to Jacob Hoefnagel, ca. 1610]]
The English traveller [[Peter Mundy]] visited Mauritius in 1638 and described the Red Rail as follows:
{{Quotation|A Mauritius henne, a Fowle as bigge as our English hennes, of a yellowish Wheaten Colour, of which we only got one. It hath a long, Crooked sharpe pointed bill. Feathered all over, butte on their wings they are soe Few and smalle that they cannot with them raise themselves From the ground. There is a pretty way of taking them with a red cap, but this of ours was taken with a stick. They bee very good Meat, and are also Cloven footed, soe that they can Neyther Fly nor Swymme.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1111/j.1474-919X.1915.tb08192.x}}</ref>}}
The yellowish colouration instead of the red mentioned by other accounts has been used as argument for this referring to a distinct species, ''Kuina mundyi'', but it has also been suggested it was due to the observed bird being a juvenile.<ref name="OlsonB"/> Another English traveller, John Marshall, described the bird as follows in 1668:
{{Quotation|Here are also great plenty of Dodos or red hens which are larger a little than our English henns, have long beakes and no, or very little Tayles. Their fethers are like down, and their wings so little that it is not able to support their bodies; but they have long leggs and will runn very fast, and that a man shall not catch them, they will turn so about in the trees. They are good meate when roasted, tasting something like a pig, and their skin like pig skin when roosted, being hard.<ref name="Lost Land"/>}}

The travel journal of the [[Dutch East India Company]] ship ''Gelderland'' (1601<U+2013>1603), rediscovered in the 1860s, contains good sketches of several now-extinct Mauritian birds attributed to the artist Joris Laerle, including an unlabelled Red Rail. The bird appears to have been stunned or killed, and the sketch is the earliest record of the species, but was only rediscovered in the 1860s. The image was sketched with pencil and finished in ink, but details such as a deeper beak and the shoulder of the wing are only seen in the underlying sketch.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.3366/anh.2003.30.1.13}}</ref> In addition, there are three rather crude black-and-white sketches, but differences in them were enough for some authors to suggest that each image depicted a distinct species, leading to the creation of several scientific names which are now synonymous with ''Aphanapteryx bonasia''.<ref name="Fuller Extinct"/>

Contemporary accounts are repetitive and do not shed much light on the bird's life history. Its diet was never reported, but the shape of the beak indicates it could have captured [[reptile]]s and [[invertebrate]]s.<ref name="Lost Land"/> There were many endemic land snails on Mauritius, including the extinct ''[[Tropidophora carinata]]'', and subfossil shells have been found with damage matching attacks from the beak of the Red Rail.<ref>{{cite book

An anonymous Dutchman gave some description of behavioural traits in 1631: 
{{Quotation|The soldiers [Red Rails] were very small in stature and slow of foot, so they could be caught easily by hand, their armour or gun was their mouth, which was sharp and pointed, and which they used instead of a dagger, were very naked and [unrecognisable word], not hewing about like soldiers, run about in great disorder, now here, now there, not being true to each other at all.<ref name="Lost Land"/>}}
While it was swift and could escape when chased, it was easily lured by waving a red cloth, which they approached to attack; a similar behaviour was noted in its relative, the Rodrigues Rail. The birds could then be picked up, and their cries when held would draw more individuals to the scene, as the birds, which had evolved in the absence of mammalian [[predator]]s, were curious and not afraid of humans.<ref name="Fuller Extinct"/> 
[[File:Lophopsittacus.mauritianus.jpg|thumb|alt=Sketch showing Red Rail, a Dodo and a parrot|Labeled sketch from 1634 by Sir Thomas Herbert, showing a Broad-billed Parrot, a Red Rail, and a Dodo]]
The English traveller Sir Thomas Herbert described its behaviour towards red cloth in 1634:
{{Quotation|The hens in eating taste like parched pigs, if you see a flocke of twelve or twenties, shew them a red cloth, and with their utmost silly fury they will altogether flie upon it, and if you strike downe one, the rest are as good as caught, not budging an iot till they be all destroyed.<ref name="Lost Land"/>}}
Many other endemic species of Mauritius went extinct after the arrival of man heavily damaged the [[ecosystem]], making it hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, but very little remains today due to [[deforestation]].<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1017/S0030605300020457}}</ref> The surviving endemic [[fauna]] is still seriously threatened.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1017/S0030605300012643}}</ref> The Red Rail lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the Dodo, the [[Broad-billed Parrot]], the [[Mascarene Grey Parakeet]], the [[Mauritius Blue Pigeon]], the [[Mauritius Owl]], the [[Mascarene Coot]], the [[Mauritian Shelduck]], the [[Mauritian Duck]], and the [[Mauritius Night Heron]]. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the [[saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise]], the [[domed Mauritius giant tortoise]], the [[Mauritian giant skink]], and the [[Round Island burrowing boa]]. The [[small Mauritian flying fox]] and the snail ''Tropidophora carinata'' lived on Mauritius and R<U+00E9>union, but went extinct in both islands. Some plants, such as ''[[Casearia tinifolia]]'' and the [[palm orchid]], have also become extinct.<ref name="Lost Land"/>

[[File:Aphanapteryx bonasia.JPG|thumb|left|alt=drawing that includes a Red Rail|Pieter van den Broecke's 1617 drawing of a Dodo, a one-horned sheep, and a Red Rail]]
Johann Christian Hoffmann, who was on Mauritius in the early 1670s, described a Red Rail hunt as follows:

{{Quotation|... [there is also] a particular sort of bird known as toddaerschen which is the size of an ordinary hen. [To catch them] you take a small stick in the right hand and wrap the left hand in a red rag, showing this to the birds, which are generally in big flocks; these stupid animals precipitate themselves almost without hesitation on the rag. I cannot truly say whether it is through hate or love of this colour. Once they are close enough, you can hit them with the stick, and then have only to pick them up. Once you have taken one and are holding it in your hand, all the others come running up as it to its aid and can be offered the same fate.<ref name="Lost Land"/>}}

Hoffman's account refers to the Red Rail by the German version of the Dutch name originally applied to the Dodo, "Dod-aers", and John Marshall used "red hen" interchangeably with "Dodo" in 1668. Mascarene expert Anthony Cheke has suggested that the name "Dodo" was transferred to the Red Rail after the former had gone extinct, so that all post 1662 references to "Dodos" refer to the rail instead.<ref name="Extinction date">{{Cite doi|10.1111/j.1474-919X.2006.00478.x}}</ref> A 1681 account of a "Dodo", previously thought to have been the last, mentioned that the meat was "hard", similar to the description of Red Hen meat.<ref name="Lost Land"/> [[Errol Fuller]] has also cast the 1662 "Dodo" sighting in doubt, as the reaction to distress cries of the birds mentioned matches what was described for the Red Rail.<ref name="Fuller Extinct"/> Milne-Edwards suggested that early travellers may have confused young Dodos with Red Rails.<ref name =Greenway/>
[[File:Aphanapteryx bonasia by Mundy.jpg|thumb|alt=drawing of Red Rail|Life drawing by [[Peter Mundy]], 1638]]
230 years before [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]], the appearance of the Red Rail and the Dodo led Peter Mundy to speculate:
{{Quotation|Of these 2 sorts off fowl afforementionede, For oughtt wee yett know, Not any to bee Found out of this Iland, which lyeth aboutt 100 leagues From [[St. Lawrence]]. A question may bee demaunded how they should bee here and Not elcewhere, beeing soe Farer From other land and can Neither fly or swymme; whither by Mixture off kindes producing straunge and Monstrous formes, or the Nature of the Climate, ayer and earth in alltring the First shapes in long tyme, or how.<ref name="Fuller Extinct"/>}}

===Extinction===
In addition to hunting pressure by humans, the fact that the Red Rail nested on the ground made it vulnerable to pigs and other [[introduced animals]], which ate their eggs and young, probably contributing to its extinction. When [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Leguat]], who had become familiar with the Rodrigues Rail in the preceding years, arrived on [[Mauritius]] in 1693, he remarked that the Red Rail had already become rare. He was the last source to mention the bird, so it is assumed that it became extinct around 1700.<ref name="Fuller Extinct"/><ref name="Leguat">{{cite book
