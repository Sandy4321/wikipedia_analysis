'''Old South Arabian''' (or '''Epigraphic South Arabian''', or '''<U+1E62>ayhadic''') is a group of four closely related extinct languages spoken in the far [[South Arabia|southern portion]] of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. There were a number of other Old South Arabian languages (e.g. Aws<U+0101>nian), of which very little evidence has survived, however. All those languages were older than [[Classical Arabic]], which developed around the 4th century.<ref>"A History of the Arabic Language". Linguistics.byu.edu. Archived  from the original on 5 May 2010. Retrieved 4 May 2010.</ref> A sole surviving Sayhadic language is attested at [[Jabal Razih language|Jabal R<U+0101>zi<U+1E25>]] in far north-west of [[Yemen]], though the varieties of speech in neighboring areas have both Arabic and Sayhadic features, and it is difficult to classify them as either Arabic dialects with a Sayhadic substratum, or Sayhadic languages that have been restructured under pressure of Arabic.

== Classification issues ==
It was originally thought that all four members of this group were dialects of one Old South Arabian language, but in the mid-twentieth century Beeston finally proved that they did in fact constitute independent languages.<ref>[[Alfred Felix Landon Beeston|A. F. L. Beeston]]: ''Sabaic Grammar'', Manchester, 1984</ref>
[[File:HistoryofBariq.jpg|thumb|South Arabian alphabet inscribed in a rock in [[Bariq|Bariq province]]]]
The Old South Arabian languages were originally classified (partly on the basis of geography) as South Semitic, along with Arabic, Modern South Arabian and Ethiopian Semitic; more recently however, a new classification has come in use which places Old South Arabian, along with Arabic, Ugaritic, Aramaic and [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] in a Central Semitic group; leaving Modern South Arabian and Ethiopic in a separate group. This new classification is based on Arabic, Old South Arabic and Northwest Semitic (Ugaritic, Aramaic and Canaanite) sharing an innovation in the verbal system, an imperfect taking the form *''yVqtVl-u'' (the other groups have ''*yVqattVl'')'';'' Nebes showed that Sabaean at least had the form ''yVqtVl'' in the imperfect.

Even though has been now accepted that the four main languages be considered independent, they are clearly closely related linguistically and derive from a common ancestor because they share certain morphological innovations. One of the most important isoglosses retained in all four languages is the suffixed definite article - ''(h)n''.<ref>(Beeston: 1987:103)</ref> There are however significant differences between the languages.

The four main Old South Arabian languages were [[Sabaean language|Sabaean]], [[Minaean language|Minaeic]] (or Madhabic), [[Qatabanian language|Qatabanic]], and [[Hadramautic language|Hadramitic]].  According to Alice Faber (based on Hetzron's work),<ref>{{cite book|last=Faber|first=Alice|title=The Semitic Languages|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-05767-1|edition=1st ed.|editor=Robert Hetzron|page=7|chapter=Genetic Subgrouping of the Semitic Languages}}</ref> together with [[Ethiopian Semitic languages]] (such as the contemporary [[Ge'ez language]]) and the [[Modern South Arabian]] languages (not descended from Old South Arabian but from a sister language), they formed the western branch of the [[South Semitic languages]].

Old South Arabian had its own writing system, [[South Arabian alphabet|the Ancient South Arabian Monumental Script]], or ''Musnad'', consisting of 29 [[grapheme]]s concurrently used for proto-Ge'ez in the Kingdom of [[D`mt]], ultimately sharing a common origin with the other [[Semitic abjads]], the [[Proto-Sinaitic alphabet]]. Inscriptions in another minuscule cursive script written on wooden sticks have also been discovered.

The last inscription of these languages dates back to 554 CE, 60 years before Islam.<ref>Fattovich, Rodolfo, "Akk<U+00E4>l<U+00E4> Guzay" in Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A-C. Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz KG, 2003, p. 169</ref><ref>Sabaean inscription (C 325), dated 669 of the <U+1E24>imyarite era (=559 or 554 CE) (Leonid Kogan and [[Andrey Korotayev]]: Sayhadic Languages (Epigraphic South Arabian). ''Semitic Languages''. London: Routledge, 1997. pg. 321).</ref>

==Languages==
Old South Arabian comprised a number of languages; the following are those that have been preserved in writing (the dates follow the so-called 'Long Chronology'{{what|date=May 2014}}).  Besides these, at least [[Jabal Razih language|Jabal Razih]] survives today. 

*[[Sabaean language|{{Unicode|Sabaean}}]]: the language of the kingdom of [[Sheba|Saba]] and later also of [[Himyar|<U+1E24>imyar]]; also documented in the Ethiopian kingdom of [[D<U+02BF>mt|Da'amot]];<ref>A. Avanzini: ''Le iscrizioni sudarabiche d'Etiopia: un esempio di culture e lingue a contatto.'' In: ''Oriens antiquus'', 26 (1987), Seite 201-221</ref> very well documented, ca. 6000 Inscriptions
**{{Unicode|Old Sabaean}}: 8th until 2nd century BC.
**{{Unicode|Middle Sabaean}}: 1st century BC until the 4th century AD (The best documented language.)<ref>Dialekte nach: Peter Stein: ''Zur Dialektgeographie des Sab<U+00E4>ischen.'' In: ''Journal of Semitic Studies XLIX/2.'' Manchester 2004</ref>
***{{Unicode|<U+1E24>aramitic}}: the language of the area to the north of Ma'<U+012B>n<ref>{{Literatur|Jahr=2007|Autor=Peter Stein|Titel=Materialien zur sab<U+00E4>ischen Dialektologie: Das Problem des amiritischen ("haramitischen") Dialektes|Sammelwerk=Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenl<U+00E4>ndischen Gesellschaft|Band=157|Seiten=13-47}}</ref>
***Central Sabaean: the language of the inscriptions from the Sabaean heartland.
***South Sabaean: the language of the inscriptions from [[Radman, Yemen|Radman]] and [[Himyar|<U+1E24>imyar]]
***"{{Unicode|Pseudo-Sabaean}}": the literary language of Arabian tribes in [[Najran|Najr<U+0101>n]], [[Haram|<U+1E24>aram]] and [[Ancient towns in Saudi Arabia|Qaryat al-F<U+0101>w]]
***Late Sabaean: 5th- 6th centuries AD.
*{{Unicode|[[Minaean]]}} (also called ''Madhabian''): the language of the city states in [[Al Jawf Region|al-Jawf]] <U+2212> with the exception of [[Haram|{{Unicode|<U+1E24>aram}}]] <U+2212> especially the later sparsely populated state of [[Ma'in]] (Recorded from the 8th until 2nd century BC).  Inscriptions have also been found also outside Ma'<U+012B>n in the commercial colonies of [[Dedan]] and [[Mada'in Saleh|Mad<U+0101>'in <U+1E62><U+0101>li<U+1E25>]], in Egypt and also on [[Delos]]. (ca. 500 inscriptions)
*[[Qatabanian language|Qatab<U+0101>nian]]: the language of the kingdom of [[Qataban|Qatab<U+0101>n]], recorded from the 5th century BC until the 2nd century (barely 2000 inscriptions)
**{{Unicode|Aws<U+0101>nian}}: the language of the kingdom of [[Kingdom of Awsan|Aws<U+0101>n]], poorly recorded (ca. 25 inscriptions, 8th/ 1st century BC until about the 1st century AD). Indistinguishable from Qatab<U+0101>nian.
**Other varieties such as the language of the tribe of Radm<U+0101>n
*[[Hadramautic|{{Unicode|<U+1E24>a<U+1E11>ramitic}}]] (or Ha<U+1E11>ramitic): the language of [[Hadhramaut|<U+1E24>a<U+1E11>ramaut]], with an additional inscription from the Greek island of Delos. 5th century BC until the 4th century AD. (ca. 1000 inscriptions)

==Written records==
Old South Arabian was written in the Old South Arabian script, a consonantal abjad deriving from the Phoenician alphabet. Compared with other parts of the ancient world, Palestine for instance, the number of surviving inscriptions is very high, something in the region of 10,000 inscriptions exist. The Sabaean lexicon contains about 2500 words.

===Categories of written records===
#Inscriptions in Stone
##Votive Inscriptions, often preserve historical accounts of the events that led to the dedication
##Inscriptions on Buildings: give the names of the person who commissioned the work and the historical circumstances among other things
##Laws and legislation
##Protocols and deeds
##Inscriptions written for atonement or repentance
##Graffiti on Rocks
#Literary Texts: if large numbers of any such texts ever existed, they have been almost completely lost
#Inscriptions on Wooden Cylinders (only Middle Sabaean and Hadramite). There are about 1000 so far; very few published, mostly from Nashsh<U+0101>n, in W<U+0101>d<U+012B> Madh<U+0101>b.<ref>Leonid Kogan and [[Andrey Korotayev]]: Sayhadic Languages (Epigraphic South Arabian). ''Semitic Languages''. London: Routledge, 1997. Pg. 221.</ref> 
##Private Texts
##Contracts and orders
#Inscriptions on everyday objects

The inscriptions on stone display a very formal and precise wording and expression, whereas the style of the wooden inscriptions written in the cursive script is much more informal.

==History of research and teaching==
Although the inscriptions from ancient South Arabia were already known by the 18th century, it was [[Wilhelm Gesenius]] (1786-1842) and his student [[Emil R<U+00F6>diger]] who finally undertook the deciphering of the script, actually independently of each other, in the years 1841/42. Then in the second half of the 19th century [[Joseph Hal<U+00E9>vy]] and [[Eduard Glaser]] brought hundreds of Old South Arabian inscriptions, tracings (?) and copies back to Europe. On the basis of this large amount of material [[Fritz Hommel]] prepared a selection of texts in 1893 along with an attempt at a grammar. Later on the Sabaean expert [[Nikolaus Rhodokanakis]] made especially important steps towards understanding Old South Arabic. A completely new field of Old South Arabian script and texts has been opened up since the 1970s by the discovery of wooden cylinders on which Sabaean has been written with a pen. The unknown script and numerous incomprehensible words presented Sabaean Studies with new problems, and to this day the wooden cylinders are not completely understood.

In the German speaking world Old South Arabian is taught in the framework of Semitic Studies, and no independent university chair has been dedicated to Old South Arabian (or Sabaean) Studies. Learning Old South Arabic at least furthers the student<U+2019>s knowledge of the characteristics of Semitic by introducing them to a less well-preserved example of the group. Students normally begin to learn the grammar of Old South Arabian and then they finally read a few of the longer texts.
