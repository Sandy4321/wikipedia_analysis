'''Niloofar Rahmani''' (Persian:<U+0646><U+06CC><U+0644><U+0648><U+0641><U+0631> <U+0631><U+062D><U+0645><U+0627><U+0646><U+06CC> born 1992) is the first female fixed-wing Air Force aviator in [[Afghanistan]]'s history and the first female pilot in the Afghani military since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. Though her family received death threats, she persevered to complete her training and won the U.S. State Department's [[International Women of Courage Award]] in 2015.<ref name="Women of Courage (2015)" />

==Biography==
Niloofar Rahmani was born in Afghanistan in 1992. Since she was a child, she had a dream of becoming a pilot and spent nearly a year studying English to be able to attend fight school.<ref name="Jawad (2013)">{{cite news|last1=Jawad|first1=Sayed|title=First Female Afghan Air Force pilot graduated in 30 years|url=http://www.khaama.com/first-female-afghan-air-force-pilot-graduated-in-30-years-1453|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=Khaama Press|date=16 May 2013}}</ref> She enlisted in the [[Afghan Air Force]] Officer Training Program in 2010 and in July 2012 graduated as a Second Lieutenant.<ref name="Women of Courage (2015)">{{cite news|title=Biographies of 2015 Award Winners|url=http://www.state.gov/s/gwi/programs/iwoc/2015/bio/index.htm|accessdate=10 March 2015|publisher=U.S. State Department|date=March 2015}}</ref>

Two female helicopter pilots during the [[Soviet]] era and her father, served as inspiration for Rahmani's achievement.<ref name=newscentral>{{cite news|title=MilitaryFirst Afghan female pilot aims to soar|url=http://newscentral.exsees.com/item/73212e35c38ee0cee04cb2fa4d63e78b-22cb9aafefa0a4b2143638d99f89fd1b|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=newscentral|date=10 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="Kovach (2015)">{{cite news|last1=Kovach|first1=Gretel C.|title=Pilot Breaks Gender Barrier|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2015/mar/10/tp-pilot-breaks-gender-barrier/|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=U-T SanDiego|date=March 10, 2015}}</ref> Her first solo fight was in a Cessna 182, but soon she was flying military cargo aircraft. Women are traditionally banned from transporting dead or wounded soldiers; however, Rahmani defied orders when she landed a mission and discovered injured soldiers. Flying them to a hospital, she reported her actions to her superiors, who imposed no sanctions.<ref name="Naso (2015)">{{cite news|last1=Naso|first1=Bridget|title=Groundbreaking Female Afghan Pilot Inspires in San Diego|url=http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Groundbreaking-Female-Afghan-Pilot-Inspires-in-San-Diego-295700951.html|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=NBC San Diego|date=Mar 9, 2015}}</ref>

When her achievement was published, Captain Rahmani's family received threats from both family members and the Taliban, who disapproved of her ambition and career choices. The family has had to move several times<ref name="Women of Courage (2015)" /> but Rahmani is resolute and aims to fly a larger C-130 plane and become a fight instructor to inspire other women.<ref name="Kovach (2015)" />
