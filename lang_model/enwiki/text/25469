The '''Oslo Tramway''' ({{lang-no|Trikken}}) is a {{convert|131.4|km|mi}} [[tram]]way in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], consists of six lines with 99 stops and a daily ridership of 100,000<U+2014>accounting for 20%. It is operated by [[Oslo Sporvognsdrift]], a subsidiary of the municipal owned [[Kollektivtransportproduksjon]] who maintain the tack and 72 tram vehicles on contracts with the public transport authority [[Ruter]]. The system operates on [[standard gauge]] and uses 750 overhead [[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]]. Depot, workshops and headquarters are at [[Grefsen]] (at the terminus of lines 13 and 17).
==History==
The first tram in Oslo was opened in 1875 with a short line between [[Homansbyen]] west of the city centre, [[Oslo Vestbanestasjon|Oslo West Railway Station]] and a sideline to Gr<U+00F8>nland, east of the city centre. The first "trams" were in fact [[horse]] drawn vehicles on flanged steel wheels. The first expansion of the line came in [[1878]] with a line to the [[Gr<U+00FC>nerl<U+00F8>kka]] neighborhood to the north.

Electric tram service was initiated in [[1894]] with a line over Briskeby to [[Majorstuen]], a route south of the original Homansbyen line. Horsedrawn service was entirely replaced with electric service in [[1900]]. For a long time, there were two tram companies operating in Oslo, "Gr<U+00F8>nntrikken" ("The Green Trams" with a green and yellow [[livery]]) and "Bl<U+00E5>trikken" ("The Blue Trams" with a blue livery). These companies were merged together in [[1924]]. The Norwegian word '''trikk''' (tram) derives from the [[English language|English]] word ''electric''. During the 1910s, 1920s and 1930s, the network continued to expand, with the most notable addition being the construction of Ekebergbanen, a line up along the hill along the east side of the [[Oslo Fjord]], south of the city. It was operated by a separate company. It was originally built to S<U+00E6>ter in [[1917]], the line was completed to Ljabru in [[1941]]. The tram network reached its greatest extent in [[1939]] with the opening of the northeastern line to Sinsen.

After [[World War II]], the tram network started being gradually being replaced with diesel [[bus]]es, closures started in [[1947]], and in [[1960]], the city council decided to aim for a complete dismantlement of the entire tram system. A number of lines had been replaced with the [[Oslo T-bane|T-bane]] [[Rapid transit|subway]] system, and the versatility of buses was attractive to the local politicians. However in [[1977]], the city council rescinded its decision to close the tram system. An order was made for a set of new articulated trams to supplement the aging fleet. The first of these trams, the SL79 was delivered in [[1982]]. 

The tram network was expanded slightly in the 1990s. A line over [[Aker Brygge]] was added in [[1995]], and in [[1999]] an extension of the northwestern Ullev<U+00E5>l line was extended past the [[University of Oslo]] campus, to the new [[Rikshospitalet]] national hospital. A further renewal of the tram fleet by the addition of Italian double-articulated SL95 cars was also started. In [[2002]] the tram appeared to fall on hard times again. Oslo Sporveier was strapped for cash, and the board passed a decision to close down much of the tram system and replace it with buses. However, such a drastic change of operations forced a general assembly to meet, and most of the closures were cancelled. Finally, only the northernmost line to Kjels<U+00E5>s was closed in November 2002. In [[2003]], the tram system which had been part of Oslo Sporveier, was fissioned out to a separate company, Oslotrikken. However, Oslotrikken was instructed to drop the "Oslo" prefix in their name shortly after, making '''Trikken''' their official name. The line to Kjels<U+00E5>s was reopened in [[2004]], exactly two years after it was first closed.

==Line Network==
Most of the tram lines in Oslo go near the downtown area, and all the lines on the system go either through downtown, or, more rarely, terminate there. As of [[2005]] there are six lines, all of which operate daily, usually on a schedule with a 10-minute headway, or 20-minute schedule during late evenings and weekends. The entire network is 131.4 km long. Many stretches are operated by two or more lines. In central areas, served by more than one line, there is a maximum of 5-minute headway between trams, a concept named "Rullende fortau" (rolling sidewalk) by the tram company.

Among the more notable stretches are:
*Ekebergbanen is the southernmost route, which runs up the hillside along the east coast of the Oslo Fjord, finally ending at Ljabru. It was one of the lines proposed axed in 2002, but spared at the general assembly. Ekebergbanen is more a [[light rail]] than a tram, as it runs on a separate track, and not in the street. It is served fully by line 19 and partially by line 18. 
*Lilleakerbanen, also more like a [[light rail]], is the most western route, and the only tram line which does not stay within the city limits of Oslo. The last station on the line, [[Jar (station)|Jar]], lies in [[B<U+00E6>rum]]. The tram line actually joins with [[Kols<U+00E5>sbanen]] of the subway system for the last stretch. Formerly, trams would run late night passenger services on Kols<U+00E5>sbanen, but this has been discontinued, although there are tram sheds on Kols<U+00E5>sbanen beyond Jar. The line is served by line 13. Since December 2, 2007 tram operations have returned on this line from Jar to Bekkestua, this part of Kols<U+00E5>sbanen being closed for several years pending upgrading. Operations beyond Jar use SL95 trams as there is no turnback loop at Bekkestua. Some runs turn back at Jar and are often run using SL79 trams.

===Lines===
The lines are [[color coding|color coded]], and the colors appear on the line map as well as destination signs (but not any more on the SL-79 trams since they have digital destination displays). Line 11 and 13 share colors, as do lines 18 and 19. Up until the 2005 restructuring of the tram system there was also a line 10 (Jar-Sk<U+00F8>yen-Aker Brygge-Jernbanetorget-Ullev<U+00E5>l-Rikshospitalet), color coded blue. Line 13 trams now serving [[Bekkestua (station)|Bekkestua]] can be seen with blue background destination signs.

Destinations in brackets are only served during off-peak hours. Lines 11 and 12 are run jointly. A line 11 tram arriving at Majorstuen continues as a line 12 and vice versa. The same applies to the lines 13 and 17 at their terminus Grefsen.

[[Image:Route13Sign.jpg|thumb|Blue Destination Sign. Route 13 to Bekkestua uses these signs.]]

Since lines 11, 12 and 19 run over Majorstuen, where several turns are too sharp for the newer SL-95 trams, they are operated with the lighter SL-79 trams. Lines 17 and 18 run to Rikshospitalet, which need to be operated by the bidirectional SL-95 trams. Both tram types are operating on line 13, though SL-79 trams only at rush hours and as far as [[Jar (station)|Jar]] where there is a turning loop and SL-95 trams may operate to [[Bekkestua (station)|Bekkestua]].

==Rolling stock==

[[Image:OsloTram.jpg|thumb|[[SL95]]. These have operated on line 12 when the line between Frogner plass and Majorstuen is closed for maintenance. Usually line 12 is operated by SL79 trams.]]
===Current rolling stock===
The Oslo tram system has 72 trams.
*40 six-axle trams of type [[SL79]], numbered 101-140. These are single-articulated, and operate in one direction only. They were delivered in two batches, the first batch, with 25 trams, started arriving in 1982, the second batch of 15 trams arrived in 1989. The two batches are fairly similar, but with different interiors, and the rear door of the second batch is double. The first ten trams were produced by [[Duewag]] of Germany, the rest were produced by [[Asea Brown Boveri|ABB]] at [[Str<U+00F8>mmen]], west of Oslo. The trams are 22.18 metres long, 2.50 metres wide, 3,41 metres tall and weigh 32.8 tons. The tram can take 163 passengers, 71 of which are seated.

*32 eight-axle trams of type [[SL95]], numbered 141-172 and delivered in 1998-2006. These double-articulated, partly [[low-floor tram]]s can go backwards as well as forward due to the presence of driver cabs at either end and doors on both sides. They can therefore operate on the Ullev<U+00E5>l line to Rikshospitalet which does not have a turning circle at the end of the line. However, the large [[turning radius]] and heavy weight of the tram makes it unsuitable for some of the lines to Majorstuen, which have poor tracks and sharp turns. The SL95s were delivered by the [[Italy|Italian]] company Ansaldo/[[Firema Trasporti|Firema]], now [[Ansaldobreda]]. The SL95 is 33.12 metres long, 2.6 metres wide, 3.62 metres tall and weighs 64.98 tons. The tram has a capacity for 212 passengers, 88 of which are seated.

There are also some old trams which are brought out on special occasions. During the summer, tram no. 70 together with trailer no. 647 operates scheduled trips on Sundays. It was built by Falkenried in [[Hamburg, Germany]] in 1913 for Gr<U+00F8>nntrikken. It remained in regular passenger service until [[1968]] and continued to serve as a maintenance vehicle. For the tram's 100 year jubilee, the no. 70 tram was restored in [[1994]]. Trailer no. 647, complete with the classical open platforms, is a replica of an old trailer, built from parts from tram no. 71.

===Recently retired rolling stock===
*The fifty 4-axle H<U+00F8>ka motor cars (designated SM53 and numbered 204-253) entered service in 1952-58. These were not articulated trams, but usually pulled a matching trailer (designated ST55 and numbered 551-580) in order to increase capacity. In the mid 1980s eleven of these motor cars were rebuilt and modernised. These trams were given the designation SM83 and numbered 261-271. All these trams were retired in 2000 when Oslo Sporveier increased the [[voltage]] of the network from 600 V to 750 V.
*In the early 1990s the line over Storo was amputated by construction work, and the line had therefore no turning circle at the end of the line. To solve this problem, a number of old trams were purchased from [[Gothenburg]] at the price of 1 [[Norwegian krone|krone]] each. These trams, which had been built between 1958 and 1962, and designated M25 in Gothenburg, were coupled back-to-back so that a driver's cabin was available at either end of the train. They were designated SM91 in Oslo. The condition of the SM91 was somewhat better than the aging H<U+00F8>ka cars, so they replaced them. The SM91 was never popular with passengers, they were as noisy as the H<U+00F8>ka, and the rear doors, which would only allow people out of the tram, had to be pushed open manually by passengers from the inside. After a fatal accident involving the doors of this tram type in January 2001, the trams no longer ran coupled together in trains. They were finally retired in November 2002.
