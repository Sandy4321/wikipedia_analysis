"'''Yellow'''" is a song by British [[alternative rock]] band [[Coldplay]]. The band wrote the song and co-produced it with British record producer [[Ken Nelson (British record producer)|Ken Nelson]] for their debut album, ''[[Parachutes]]'' (2000). The song's lyrics are a reference to band vocalist [[Chris Martin]]'s unrequited love.

The song was recorded in March 2000, and released in June that same year as the second single from ''Parachutes'', following "[[Shiver (Coldplay song)|Shiver]]", and the [[lead single]] in the United States. The single reached number four in the [[UK Singles Chart]], giving the band their first top-five hit in the United Kingdom. Helped by [[heavy rotation]] and usage in promotions, the song thrust the band into massive popularity. "Yellow" has since been [[cover (music)|covered]] by various recording artists worldwide, and remains one of the band's most popular songs.

==Background and inspiration==
"Yellow" was written in a [[Rockfield Studios|Rockfield]] studio in [[Wales]] called the Quadrangle, where Coldplay began working on their debut album, ''[[Parachutes]]''.<ref name="Inglis">{{cite web|url= http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct00/articles/ken.htm |title=Recording Coldplay's Parachutes|last=Inglis|first=Sam|month=October | year=2000|work=SOS|accessdate=5 September 2008}}</ref> One night after finishing recording "[[Shiver (Coldplay song)|Shiver]]", the lead single of the album, the band took a break and went out of the studio.<ref name="BashamEscape">{{cite news|url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427212/20001016/coldplay.jhtml|title=Coldplay Escapes City For "Yellow" Single, Video|last=Basham|first=David|date=16 October 2000|publisher=MTV|accessdate=9 September 2008}}</ref> Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and "just amazing", according to the song's co-producer, [[Ken Nelson (British record producer)|Ken Nelson]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/whatson/yellow.shtml|title=BRITs 25 Song Award: Yellow - Coldplay|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=5 September 2008}}</ref> He told the band to look at the stars, which they did. Vocalist [[Chris Martin]] was inspired by the sight and the song's main [[melody]], consisting of a chord pattern, popped into his head. At first, Martin did not take it seriously "as he relayed the tune to the rest of the band in his worst [[Neil Young]] impersonation voice". Martin has said, "The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice."<ref name="Roach39">Roach, p. 39</ref> The melody "started off a lot slower", according to drummer [[Will Champion]], and it sounded like a Neil Young song.<ref name="BashamEscape" /><ref name="HiattRS" /> Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the [[tempo]] of the verse. When guitarist [[Jonny Buckland]] started playing it and supplemented it with his ideas, they had created the [[riff]], "and it sort of got a bit heavier".<ref name="BashamEscape" />

While composing the song's lyrics, Martin could not find the right words. He was thinking of a specific word, which he deemed a missing key word in the lyrics, to fit the song's concept. He looked around the studio and found the [[telephone directory]] [[Yellow Pages]], which happened to be situated nearest to him.<ref name="Roach39" /><ref name="HiattRS">{{cite web|title=Coldplay Revive TV Show|date=1 June 2005|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|accessdate=18 December 2006|url= http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/prince/articles/story/7371897/coldplay_revive_tv_show }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000921672 |title=Coldplay Tells Stories At Intimate New York Gig|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|date=17 May 2005|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=5 September 2008}}</ref> Martin later titled the song "Yellow" as a reference to the directory. He quipped, "In an alternate universe, this song could be called '[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]].'"<ref name="HiattRS" /> The lyrics progressed from there with the band collaborating. Bassist [[Guy Berryman]] came up with the opening line "Look at the stars". That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it.

A much different origin of the song was told on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' in November 2011. Chris Martin explained to Stern that he was impersonating Neil Young while entertaining guests when he came across the first chord of the song, which stuck with him for a bit then in a Neil Young voice he sang "look at the stars". Martin went on to further explain that the word "yellow" has absolutely no meaning whatsoever and while writing the rest of the song he tried his best to change yellow to something else since every lyric before yellow made no sense but in the end the word "yellow" just sounded right. Martin also told Stern that through the years depending on the attitude and manner of whoever interviews him, he would make up some story about a song or album titles just to move on to the next question. Martin applauded Stern saying "I like you, Howard, so that's the first time I've ever told anyone the truth behind 'Yellow'."{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}<!-- Howard Stern Show, day??? November 2011, etc. webpage transcript? -->

==Recording and production==
The band and Nelson produced the track. Nelson was acquainted with the band's music through the former's manager. Nelson's manager gave him a copy of an [[The Blue Room (EP)|EP]] and [[Brothers & Sisters (song)|single]] by Coldplay, and showed interest in working with them after seeing the band perform live. "Yellow" was initially recorded upstairs in the project studio, basically a [[demo (music)|demo]] room in [[Liverpool]]'s Parr Street Studios.<ref name="Inglis" /><ref name="BashamEscape" /> The track was later [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] in [[New York]].

Nelson and the band encountered problems in producing some aspects of the song. According to Champion, "...&nbsp;it was really difficult to record, because it worked at about five or six different [[tempo]]s. It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play, because sometimes it sounded too rushed, and sometimes it sounded as if it was dragging..."<ref name="BashamEscape" /> The band was trying to get the right tempo, according to Nelson, "because a beat either side of the tempo we picked didn't have the same [[groove (music)|groove]]". To improve the song, they recorded this part live and Buckland [[overdubbing|overdubbed]] his guitar. They recorded it two or three times until Nelson and the band were happy at the output. The backing vocals were recorded in the control room of Quadrangle.<ref name="Inglis" />

Nelson used an analogue 2-inch type tape in recording most of the tracks in the album. As recording progressed, "Yellow" was one of a couple of songs that they "couldn't quite get on analogue". They recorded different versions but it did not satisfy their taste. So Nelson used [[Pro Tools]] "to get the feel of [the track] just right"; once all takes were recorded into the computer, "we then put it down to the 2-inch, which I found was a great way to do it", according to Nelson.<ref name="Inglis" />

==Composition==
Martin has explained of the song: "'Yellow' refers to the mood of the band. Brightness and hope and devotion." The references in some of the song's lyrics, including the swimming and drawing a line, "are all metaphorical slants on the extent of his emotional devotion".<ref name="Roach40">Roach, p. 40</ref> The drawing of a line refers to Martin's habit of writing lists, and underlining those important things on the list. Martin has commented that the song is about devotion, referring to his unrequited love (Martin was single at the time he wrote the song). Despite its lyrical theme, most people have considered "Yellow" as a happy song.<ref name="Roach41">Roach, p. 41</ref>

==Release and reception==
"Yellow" and "Shiver" were initially released as [[Extended play|EP]]s in the spring of 2000.<ref name="AMGRock">{{cite book|last=Bogdanov|first=Vladimir|coauthors=Woodstra, Chris;  Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|title=All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul|publisher=Backbeat Books|year=2002|isbn=0-87930-653-X|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1-pH4i3jXvAC&pg=PA235&dq=two+more+EPs,+Shiver+and+Yellow|accessdate=7 September 2008|page=235}}</ref> The former was later released as a single in UK on 26 June 2000.

[[File:YellowLive.JPG|thumb|left|Coldplay performing "Yellow" in 2005.]]
The single, accompanied by its TV reception through its music video, received massive radio airplay, particularly at [[BBC Radio 1]]. The reaction was chiefly positive and even the newly-revitalized [[BBC Radio 2]] played the track repeatedly. This [[heavy rotation]] continued for months after its release, eventually ending as 2000's most-aired song.<ref name="Roach41"/> It has also became a sing-along number at various British clubs, pubs and sporting events;<ref name="Spitz">{{cite journal|last=Spitz|first=Marc|month=October | year=2002|title=Look at the Stars|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|page=75|url=http://www.spin.com/articles/everythings-not-lost-coldplays-spin-archives?page=0%2C6|accessdate=7 September 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080801154750/http://www.spin.com/articles/everythings-not-lost-coldplays-spin-archives?page=0%2C6 <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=1 August 2008}}</ref> the song is consistently played during home games at English Championship club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].

The song was well-received from critics.

===Chart performance===
"Yellow" played well in Europe, and was popular. In the United Kingdom, its midweek sales suggested that the single would reach the Top 10 of the chart. Although the band supposed "Yellow" would decline inside the Top 20, they would have considered its performance a triumph since the album's lead single, "Shiver", had only reached the 35th position. Since "Yellow"'s second week sales were stronger, it eventually reached number four, giving the band their first Top 10 single in the United Kingdom.<ref name="Roach42">Roach, p. 42</ref> The popularity of the song in British clubs, pubs and sporting events bolstered the album to debut at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="Spitz"/>

After Coldplay's appearance at [[Sound Relief]] in Australia, In the charting week starting 22 March 2009, the single made a return to the Australian ARIA Top 50, after almost eight years since its last appearance in the Top 50. It re-entered the chart at number 48.

==Music video==
[[File:Studlandbeach.jpg|thumb|right|The beach at [[Studland|Studland Bay]].]]
The music video for "Yellow" was filmed at [[Studland|Studland Bay]] in the county of Dorset, [[South West England]]. The video is minimalistic, featuring only Martin singing the song as he walks along the beach. He is seen wearing a raincoat with his hair wet, suggesting that it had just rained. The video is one continuous shot with no cuts. The entire sequence is in slow motion.

It was conceived and produced by Coldplay. Originally, it had been intended for the whole band to appear in the video, in a sunny setting. Champion's mother's funeral was held on the day of the shooting, so it was decided that only Martin would appear in the video, which was also the immediate explanation of his mood during this part.<ref name="Roach41" /> The weather also opposed the original plan, with harsh winds and rain instead of the sunny day that had been envisioned. It had also been originally intended for there to be moving stars in the sky, as if in a time-lapse. The directors agreed that the moving stars would distract the focus of the video from Martin.<ref name="BashamEscape" /> The plan of time advancing was kept. The video begins with the beach being somewhat dark until sunlight arrives nearly at the video's midway point.

The video was directed by British directing duo [[James Frost (video director)|James Frost]] & Alex of The Artists Company.<ref name="BashamEscape"/> It was shot at 50 frames per second, twice the regular speed. At the shoot, Chris Martin had to sing the song at double speed so that the audio and visual content would be in sync, a common yet difficult practice of music videos. The final product is slowed to 25 frames per second, giving the slow motion effect of the video. The transition of the video from night to day was achieved during the [[telecine]] process.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} During the transfer from film to videotape, an operator manually adjusted the amount of lighting for blue in the beginning, red in the middle, and yellow at the end of the video.

==Live performances==
[[File:Coldplay Yellow.jpg|thumb|right|Coldplay performing "Yellow" in 2006 during the Twisted Logic tour with yellow balloons falling.]]

Coldplay have performed the song throughout their career, and it is a firm audience favourite. The band had their debut performance on television on the show ''Later...with Jools Holland''. They performed ''Parachutes'''s lead single, "Shiver", and the new song, "Yellow"; but it was the latter that had an immediate studio audience impact.<ref name="Roach35">Roach, p. 35</ref> They have also performed at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], one of the prominent festivals in Europe. During their second appearance in July 2000, Coldplay performed "Yellow" and "effortlessly" captured over 10,000 spectators.<ref name="Roach35" /> Coldplay's popularity at this time was still growing and "Yellow" has helped cultivate it; Martin has said it was the best day of their year.<ref>Roach, p. 36</ref> During most concert performances, large yellow [[balloons]] are dropped on the audience. The first known sighting of yellow balloons was on 24 September 2002 at the [[UIC Pavilion]] in [[Chicago]]. Chris Martin noticed the balloons in the air with a surprised look. Now,{{when|date=January 2013}}<!-- vague, suboptimal wording for encyclopedia [[WP:RELTIME]] --> the balloons are filled with confetti, and at the end of the song Chris Martin pops one with his guitar and confetti flies everywhere.

A live acoustic version performed on Jo Whiley's Lunchtime Social was included on the Acoustic EP. Another live version featuring only piano and vocals performed and broadcast in Los Angeles on 89.9 KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic was included on the Japanese Clocks EP. Most recently an acoustic piano version the song was recorded in the studio for Starbucks charity compilation album Every Mother Counts 2012.

Coldplay performed the song at the 'Celebrating Steve' event at the Apple campus on October 16, 2011. Before the performance, Martin revealed that they first played it for [[Steve Jobs]] 10 years ago, Jobs said the song was "shit" and that "they would never make it".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/10oiuhfvojb23/event/index.html|title=Celebrating Steve|work=Apple|accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref>
