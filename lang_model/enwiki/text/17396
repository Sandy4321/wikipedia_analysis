'''The Lehigh Valley IronPigs''' are a new [[Minor League Baseball]] team, serving as the AAA affiliate of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].  They will begin playing their home games at [[Coca-Cola Park]], in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], in April 2008. Currently they are operating as the [[Ottawa Lynx]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]].

The name is a reference to [[pig iron]], used in the manufacturing of [[steel]], for which the [[Lehigh Valley]] region of [[Pennsylvania]] is world renowned.

==History==

The Lehigh Valley has not had a major league-affiliated baseball team since 1960, when the Allentown Red Sox left for [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]].[http://www.ballparkdigest.com/leagues/eastern_league.htm]  The Allentown Red Sox played at Breadon Field (later called Max Hess Stadium) from 1958-1960, at the site where the [[Lehigh Valley Mall]] currently stands today.[http://www.sonsofisrael.net/jlv/living/articles/070105.htm]

The region was home to a couple of [[independent baseball]] teams:  the [[Allentown Ambassadors]] of the [[Northeast League]] and the [[Lehigh Valley Black Diamonds]] of the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball]].  The Ambassadors played at [[Bicentennial Park (Allentown)|Bicentennial Park]] in Allentown until the team was disbanded in 2003.  The Black Diamonds moved from [[Newburgh, New York]] in 1999 and expected to move into a new ballpark near [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]], until that project ran into some hurdles and ultimately was terminated.  During the time the Black Diamonds waited for their new stadium, they played as a traveling team.  The team assumed the name of the [[Road Warriors (Atlantic League)|Pennsylvania Road Warriors]] when the ballpark was deconstructed and all chances to play in the Lehigh Valley were lost.

Since 2003, Joseph Finley and Craig Stein have been actively pursuing their interest in bringing affilitated baseball to the city of Allentown.  Initially, the duo pursued a single-A franchise when the [[Ottawa Lynx]] were rumored to be moving to [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]].  When the city of Harrisburg decided not to fund the effort to upgrade [[Commerce Bank Park]] to AAA standards, the [[Baltimore Orioles]] shifted their interest to Allentown.  For the 2007 season, the Phillies, Orioles, [[Washington Nationals]], [[New York Yankees]], and [[New York Mets]] all shifted their Minor League affiliates. The [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees|Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons]] (now the SWB Yankees) changed their affiliation from the Phillies to the Yankees, the [[Columbus Clippers]] from the Yankees to the Nationals, the [[New Orleans Zephyrs]] from the Nationals to the Mets, the [[Norfolk Tides]] from the Mets to the Orioles, and the Lynx from the Orioles to the Phillies.  With declining attendance in Ottawa and its distance from the [[Mid Atlantic States|Mid Atlantic]], the Orioles and the Phillies both desired to move the team to Allentown.  

In 2008, the Lehigh Valley IronPigs will play their inaugural season at Coca-Cola Park in Allentown.  The move of the Phillies AAA affiliate to Allentown has been extremely well received, since the Allentown region comprises enthusiastic Phillies fans and because the move to Allentown will permit Phillies players to rehab in Allentown without significant transportation time as compared to Ottawa (Allentown is just 60 miles north of Philadelphia).  

The IronPigs will televise all of their home games beginning in 2008, a rarity for a minor league team.  Local cable outlet [[Service Electric]] TV2 will carry IronPigs games; the station reaches nearly one million subscribers, predominantly in the [[Lehigh Valley]] region of [[Pennsylvania]]. In addition, TV2 will also feed their telecasts to Blue Ridge Cable TV-13.  All 144 IronPigs games will also be covered on local radio.
