'''[[Dartmouth College]]''' is host to many '''[[Fraternities and sororities|Greek organizations]]''' and a significant percentage of the [[undergraduate]] student body is active in Greek life.  In 2005, the school stated that 1,785 students were members of a fraternity, sorority, or [[coeducation]]al Greek house, about 60 percent of the eligible student body.<ref name="hughes">Hughes, C.J. (2006) "Bye Bye SLI." ''Dartmouth Alumni Magazine''.  Vol. 98, No. 4, Mar./Apr., 2006, p.18.</ref>  Greek organizations at Dartmouth provide both social and residential opportunities for students, and are the only single-sex residential option on [[campus]].  Greek organizations at Dartmouth do not provide dining options, as regular meals service has been banned in Greek houses since the 1910s.

Social fraternities at Dartmouth College grew out of a tradition of student [[Literary society|literary societies]] that began in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.  The first social fraternities were founded in 1842 and rapidly expanded to include the active participation of over half of the student body.  Fraternities at Dartmouth built dedicated [[Fraternity and sorority houses|residence and meeting halls]] in the 1920s, and then struggled to survive the lean years of the 1930s.  Dartmouth College was among the first institutions of higher education to [[Desegregation|desegregate]] fraternity houses in the 1950s, and was involved in the movement to create coeducational Greek houses in the 1970s.  Sororities were introduced to campus in 1977.  In the early 2000s, campus-wide debate focused on whether or not the Greek system at Dartmouth would become "substantially coeducational", but most houses retain single-sex membership policies.  

Currently, Dartmouth College extends official recognition to sixteen all-male fraternities, nine all-female sororities, and three coeducational fraternities.  The Greek houses are largely governed through three independent councils, the Interfraternity Council, the Panhellenic Council, and the Coed Council.  Dartmouth College has two [[Cultural interest fraternities and sororities|cultural interest]] fraternities, and two cultural interest sororities, which do not participate in the major governing councils, but are member organizations of national associations.

==History==

[[Image:Dartmouth_Hall.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Dartmouth Hall, circa 1834.]]
Social fraternities at Dartmouth College grew out of a tradition of student [[literary society|literary societies]] that began in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.  The first such society at Dartmouth, the Social Friends, was formed in 1783.  A rival organization, called the United Fraternity, was founded in 1786.  A chapter of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] was established at Dartmouth in 1787, and counted among its members [[Daniel Webster]], class of 1801.<ref name="webster">Kartalopoulos, William B. (1997). [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dwebster/1801/pbk.html "The Phi Beta Kappa"].  ''Daniel Webster: Class of 1801''.  [[Dartmouth College]] Archives.  Retrieved Oct. 10, 2007.</ref>  These organizations were, in large part, the only social life available to students at the College.  The organizations hosted debates on a variety of topics not encountered in the [[curriculum]] of the day, and amassed large [[library|libraries]] of titles not found in the official College library.  Both the Social Friends and the United Fraternity created libraries in Dartmouth Hall, and met in a room called Society Hall inside Dartmouth Hall.  In 1815, the College decided to intervene in the hotly contested [[recruitment]] battle between the Social Friends and the United Fraternity by restricting each society to recruit only from separate halves of the new student class.  In 1825, the College began simply assigning new students to one society or the other.  Interest in the literary societies declined in the 1830s and 1840s.  The College library and instructional curriculum had expanded to include much of what the literary societies had supported, and new Greek letter societies began to appear on campus.<ref name="meacham">Meacham, Scott (1999). ''"Halls, Tombs and Houses: Student Society Architecture at Dartmouth,"''[http://www.dartmo.com/halls/ Dartmo.: The Buildings of Dartmouth College]. 1999, updated Feb. 2004.  Retrieved Mar. 14, 2007.</ref>  

In 1841, two factions of the United Fraternity split off from the literary society.  One of the new societies called itself Omega Phi and on [[May 10]], [[1842]], obtained a charter as the Zeta chapter of [[#Psi Upsilon (<U+03A8><U+03A5>)|Psi Upsilon]].  The other faction to split from the United Fraternity organized itself on [[July 13]], [[1842]], as [[#Kappa Kappa Kappa (<U+039A><U+039A><U+039A>)|Kappa Kappa Kappa]], a local fraternity. More Greek organizations were founded, and by 1855, 64% of students, mostly upperclassmen, were members of the Greek letter societies on campus.<ref name="meacham"/>  Initially, the original Greek letter societies would not extend invitations of membership to first year students.  Two separate Greek letter organizations were created exclusively for [[first year|freshmen]]: Kappa Sigma Epsilon and Delta Kappa.  These societies would dissolve in 1883, when the fraternities of the upper classes began to [[Fraternities and sororities#Joining a fraternity or sorority|pledge]] freshmen.<ref name="trustees">Hill, Ralph Nading, Ed. (1964). ''The College on the Hill: A Dartmouth Chronicle''.  Trustees of Dartmouth College, The.  Dartmouth Publications: Hanover, New Hampshire.  p.234.</ref> A chapter of Phi Beta Kappa survived at Dartmouth, but by the 1830s had established its role as a strictly literary society by dropping requirements of secrecy for membership and activities.<ref name="phibetakappa">The Phi Beta Kappa Society (2007). [http://staging.pbk.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=History&Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&ContentID=2345 "A Brief History of Phi Beta Kappa"].  Retrieved Oct. 10, 2007.</ref>  The new, social Greek organizations distinguished themselves from Phi Beta Kappa and the previous literary societies in several ways.  The new fraternities were self-selective and exclusive.  Each organization developed its own [[Fraternities and sororities#Ritual and secrecy|secret rituals]] and procedures.  Most of the societies began to invest in creating their own meeting halls, either upstairs rooms in buildings on Main Street, or free-standing structures near campus.  There were 11 active Greek organizations at Dartmouth College in 1900.<ref name="the_eleven">The eleven fraternities active at Dartmouth College in 1900 were [[#Chi Heorot (<U+03A7>H)|Alpha Alpha Omega]], [[#Alpha Delta (<U+0391><U+0394>)|Alpha Delta Phi]], [[#Beta Theta Pi (<U+0392><U+0398><U+03A0>)|Beta Theta Pi]], [[#Delta Kappa Epsilon (<U+0394><U+039A><U+0395>)|Delta Kappa Epsilon]], [[#Zeta Psi (<U+0396><U+03A8>)|Zeta Psi]], [[#Theta Delta Chi (<U+0398><U+0394><U+03A7>)|Theta Delta Chi]], [[#Kappa Kappa Kappa (<U+039A><U+039A><U+039A>)|Kappa Kappa Kappa]], [[#The Tabard (<U+03A3><U+0395><U+03A7>)|Sigma Chi]], [[#Phi Delta Alpha (<U+03A6><U+0394><U+0391>)|Phi Delta Theta]], [[#Phi Sigma Psi (<U+03A6><U+03A3><U+03A8>)|Phi Kappa Psi]], and [[#Psi Upsilon (<U+03A8><U+03A5>)|Psi Upsilon]].</ref> 

===Expansion of the fraternity system===

The fortunes of the fraternity system at Dartmouth followed a boom and bust pattern in the early twentieth century. The economic expansion of the 1920s created a boom in the fortunes of the fraternities at Dartmouth.  Many of the fraternities built new brick residence near campus during this decade, including [[#Zeta Psi (<U+0396><U+03A8>)|Zeta Psi]], [[#Kappa Kappa Kappa (<U+039A><U+039A><U+039A>)|Kappa Kappa Kappa]], [[#Phi Tau (<U+03A6><U+03A4>)|Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[#Sigma Nu (<U+03A3><U+039D>)|Sigma Nu]], [[#Sigma Alpha Epsilon (<U+03A3><U+0391><U+0395>)|Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[#Chi Heorot (<U+03A7>H)|Chi Phi]], [[#Theta Delta Chi (<U+0398><U+0394><U+03A7>)|Theta Delta Chi]], [[#Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI)|Phi Gamma Delta]], [[#The Tabard (<U+03A3><U+0395><U+03A7>)|Sigma Chi]], [[#Gamma Delta Chi (<U+0393><U+0394><U+03A7>)|Gamma Delta Chi]], and [[#Bones Gate (BG)|Delta Tau Delta]]. It was during this period that Webster Avenue developed as "fraternity row".<ref name="meacham"/>  The new residences were built without significant dining facilities, as the Trustees of the College had banned fraternities from serving regular meals in their chapter houses since the 1910s.  College administrators also challenged the fraternities to become more engaged in College life during this time.  College President [[Ernest Martin Hopkins]] personally decided to abolish freshman [[Fraternities and sororities#Joining a fraternity or sorority|rush]] in 1924.<ref name="trustees"/>

As did the nation, fraternities at Dartmouth went through difficult times during the [[Great Depression]].  The decade of the 1930s saw almost no building projects at all in the fraternity system, and many houses could no longer afford regular maintenance.  One of the great tragedies at Dartmouth College occurred on a winter night in 1934, when eight members of [[#Alpha Theta (<U+0391><U+0398>)|Theta Chi]] died from [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning after a metal chimney on a dilapidated coal furnace in the basement of the chapter house broke in the night.<ref name="time1934">Unattributed (1934).  [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747133,00.html "Dartmouth's Saddest"].  ''[[Time Magazine]]''.  Mar. 4, 1934.</ref>  In 1935, Dartmouth historian and professor [[Leon Burr Richardson]] asserted in a survey that, in light of the national suffering, the fraternity chapters should ask themselves if they had "any excuse for existence."<ref name="trustees"/>  Four fraternities dissolved during the Great Depression ([[#Alpha Sigma Phi (<U+0391><U+03A3><U+03A6>)|Alpha Sigma Phi]], [[#Alpha Tau Omega (<U+0391><U+03A4><U+03A9>)|Alpha Tau Omega]], [[#Lambda Chi Alpha (<U+039B><U+03A7><U+0391>)|Lambda Chi Alpha]], and [[#Sigma Alpha Mu (<U+03A3><U+0391><U+039C>)|Sigma Alpha Mu]]), and two ([[#Gamma Delta Chi (<U+0393><U+0394><U+03A7>)|Phi Kappa Sigma]] and [[#Gamma Delta Chi (<U+0393><U+0394><U+03A7>)|Alpha Chi Rho]]) merged to pool scarce resources in order to survive.  All of the surviving fraternities closed for the duration of [[World War II]], as the campus was largely (although not exclusively) used to educate, train, and house [[United States Navy|Navy]] sailors and [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] being prepared for combat.<ref name="hill">Hill, Ralph Nading, Ed. (1964). ''The College on the Hill: A Dartmouth Chronicle''.  Trustees of Dartmouth College, The.  Dartmouth Publications: Hanover, New Hampshire.  p.254.</ref>

The fraternities of Dartmouth College were directly involved in the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|African-American Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s.  In 1952, the Dartmouth chapter of Theta Chi was derecognized by its national over a dispute regarding minority membership.  The Dartmouth chapter reorganized as a local fraternity named [[#Alpha Theta (<U+0391><U+0398>)|Alpha Theta]].  A campus-wide referendum held in 1954 on the issue of desegregation of fraternities resulted in a majority in favor of requiring fraternities on campus to eliminate [[racial discrimination|racially discriminatory]] membership policies by the year 1960, and to secede from national groups that retained such policies in their charters.<ref name="scobie">Scobie, Richard (1956). [http://libcat.dartmouth.edu/search/ascobie/ascobie/13%2C18%2C32%2CB/frameset&FF=ascobie+richard&1%2C1%2C ''A Fraternal Revolution: The Birth of Phi Tau Fraternity, As Told by One of the Principles: Richard Scobie.'']  Hanover, New Hampshire: 1956.</ref>  This became a binding obligation imposed on the fraternities by the college administration, and several fraternities at Dartmouth dissociated from their national organizations, including the chapters of [[#Phi Tau (<U+03A6><U+03A4>)|Phi Sigma Kappa]] (1956), [[#Bones Gate (BG)|Delta Tau Delta]] (1960), [[#Phi Delta Alpha (<U+03A6><U+0394><U+0391>)|Phi Delta Theta]] (1960), [[#The Tabard (<U+03A3><U+0395><U+03A7>)|Sigma Chi]] (1960), and [[#Sigma Nu (<U+03A3><U+039D>)|Sigma Nu]] (1963).

National social changes also affected Greek societies at Dartmouth in the 1960s and 1970s.  Many began to question the value of belonging to a national fraternal organization.  The Dartmouth chapters of [[#Alpha Chi Alpha (<U+0391><U+03A7><U+0391>)|Chi Alpha Rho]], [[#Chi Heorot (<U+03A7>H)|Chi Phi]], [[#Delta Upsilon (<U+0394><U+03A5>)|Delta Upsilon]], [[#Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI)|Phi Gamma Delta]], [[#Phi Sigma Psi (<U+03A6><U+03A3><U+03A8>)|Phi Kappa Psi]], and [[#Sigma Phi Epsilon (<U+03A3><U+03A6><U+0395>)|Sigma Phi Epsilon]] all disaffiliated from their national fraternities in the 1960s.  As political activism increased, fraternities were increasingly seen as anachronistic, and in 1967, the faculty voted 67-16 to adopt a proposal to abolish fraternities at Dartmouth.  The proposal was rejected by the [[Dartmouth College#Board of Trustees|Board of Trustees]].<ref name="dglc"/>

===Coeducation to the present===

[[Coeducation]] would dramatically change all social life at Dartmouth College, including the fraternity system.  The College first began admitting [[woman|women]] as full-time students in 1972.  By the fall of 1973, five local fraternities ([[#Alpha Theta (<U+0391><U+0398>)|Alpha Theta]], [[#Delta Upsilon (<U+0394><U+03A5>)|Foley House]], [[#The Tabard (<U+03A3><U+0395><U+03A7>)|The Tabard]], [[#Phi Tau (<U+03A6><U+03A4>)|Phi Tau]], and [[#Phi Sigma Psi (<U+03A6><U+03A3><U+03A8>)|Phi Sigma Psi]]) had all decided to adopt a coeducational membership policy and admit women as full members.  The first sorority on campus, [[#Sigma Delta (<U+03A3><U+0394>)|Sigma Kappa]], was founded in 1977.  Many alumni expressed strong concerns that the need for housing for new sororities would inevitably lead to financial pressure and the possible dissolution of existing fraternities at the College.  In response, the Trustees imposed a moratorium limiting the campus to no more than six recognized sororities.<ref name="peric">Peric, Sabrina (2002).  "How does single-sex Greek system fit with coeducation?".  ''[[The Dartmouth]]''.  Nov. 6, 2002. ''[Note: article incorrectly includes Gamma Delta Chi and incorrectly excludes Phi Sigma Psi in list of Greek organizations that decided to admit women in 1973.]</ref>  Converting from an all-male to a coeducational membership policy was not enough to save at least one Greek organization on campus.  In 1981, the [[#Harold Parmington Foundation (HPF)|Harold Parmington Foundation]] reorganized itself as a new coeducational fraternity [[#Delta Psi Delta (<U+0394><U+03A8><U+0394>)|Delta Psi Delta]], but the organization never attracted many new members and was finally forced to dissolve in the spring of 1991.  In addition, Foley House dropped out of the Greek system in 1981, although it continued to operate as a dining cooperative and as of 2007 remained an official residential option on West Street.

During the 1980s and 1990s, College administrators introduced new initiatives to hold the Greek organizations on campus more accountable for their actions and to offer more social alternatives to the predominantly single-sex Greek system.  In 1982, the administration announced that Greek organizations would have to comply with a set of "minimum standards", enforced through annual reviews, in order to remain in good standing with the College.  These standards included not only health and safety regulations regarding the conditions of the Greek houses, but requirements for Greek-sponsored activities deemed beneficial to the College community at large.<ref name="dglc"/>  The College introduced [[Dartmouth College student groups#Undergraduate societies|Undergraduate Societies]] to campus in 1993, as a residential and social alternative to Greek organizations.  Similar to the Greek houses in many respects, Undergraduate Societies were required to have open, coeducational membership policies.  [[#Phi Sigma Psi (<U+03A6><U+03A3><U+03A8>)|Panarchy]] voted to change its status to an undergraduate society and was joined the following year by a newly-formed society, called [[Dartmouth College student groups#Amarna|Amarna]].<ref name="undergrad_societies">Trustees of Dartmouth College (2006).  [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~orl/greek-soc/societies/undergrad.html "Office of Residential Life: Undergraduate Societies"].  Retrieved Feb. 23, 2006.</ref>  In the fall of 1993, [[Student Assembly]] President Andrew Beebe, class of 1993, argued in favor of the coeducation of the entire Greek system in his remarks at fall [[Convocation#Academic convocations|Convocation]].<ref name="rose">Rose, Jacqueline (1996).  "Four years at Dartmouth have brought triumph and tragedy to the Class of 1996".  ''[[The Dartmouth]]''.  June 9, 1996.</ref>  During that same academic term, College President [[James O. Freedman]] predicted that the Greek system at Dartmouth would be coeducational within 10 years.<ref name="peric"/>

In 1999, the college administration announced a "Residential and Social Life Initiative" to improve campus life.  Speculation that all single-sex fraternities and sororities would be required to adopt coeducational membership policies led to intense campus debate.  In a survey conducted by ''[[The Dartmouth]]'' newspaper, 49% of the student body responded, and 83% of those respondents were in favor of retaining a single-sex Greek system at Dartmouth.<ref name="rubenstein">Rubenstein, Sarah (1999).  "Students overwhelmingly support single-sex fraternities and sororities".  ''[[The Dartmouth]]''.  Feb. 12, 1999.</ref>  In a December, 2006 interview, College President [[James Wright (historian)|Jim Wright]] admitted that it had been "a serious mistake" to announce the Student Life Initiative in the manner in which it was presented to the campus, but expressed that in his opinion, "the Greek system at Dartmouth now is stronger than it's ever been."<ref name="tapper">Tapper, Jake (2007).

==Fraternities==
The single-sex male-only fraternities at Dartmouth College are largely organized and represented to the College through the Interfraternity Council (IFC). The Interfraternity Council is a student-led governance organization that assists the member Greek organizations with finances, public relations, programming, judicial administration, recruitment, and academic achievement.  [[#Alpha Phi Alpha (<U+0391><U+03A6><U+0391>)|Alpha Phi Alpha]] is not a member of the IFC, but is a member of the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]].
[[#Lambda Upsilon Lambda (<U+039B><U+03A5><U+039B>)|Lambda Upsilon Lambda]] is also not a member of the IFC, but is a member of the [[National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations]].<ref name="governance">Dartmouth College Office of Residential Life (2007).

The Dartmouth chapter was chartered as the 381st chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha on [[May 12]], [[1972]].  Early chapter meetings on campus were held in both the [[List of Dartmouth College buildings#The Choates Cluster|Choates]] dormitories and [[List of Dartmouth College buildings#Affinity programs|Cutter-Shabazz Hall]].

Facing smaller membership, the fraternity decided to relocate to a smaller house near the western end of Webster Avenue in the late 1980s, and in 1992, the fraternity again relocated to College-owned apartment housing.

[[Gamma Delta Chi]] (''"GDX"'') can trace its history to two fraternities on the Dartmouth College campus, [[Phi Kappa Sigma]] and [[Alpha Chi Rho]].  Gamma Delta Epsilon, a local fraternity, was founded in 1908, disbanded in 1912, but was reformed in 1921.  In 1928, the Gamma Delta Epsilon house sought to establish itself as a chapter of a national fraternity and obtained a charter from the Phi Kappa Sigma national fraternity, becoming its Kappa Chapter.  Epsilon Kappa Alpha, was established as a local fraternity on the Dartmouth campus in 1915.  As with Gamma Delta Epsilon, Epsilon Kappa Alpha sought to become a chapter of a national fraternity and was granted a charter as the Phi Nu chapter of Alpha Chi Rho in 1918.<ref name="dglc"/>  The Dartmouth chapters of Alpha Chi Rho and Phi Kappa Sigma found themselves in similar financial situations in 1934.  Both chapters owned prime lots near campus that lacked adequate residential structures.  The two fraternities decided to share their resources and in 1935 merged to become a new local fraternity, Gamma Delta Chi. The lot formerly owned by Alpha Chi Rho was sold to the [[United Church of Christ|Church of Christ]] at Dartmouth where a new church building was constructed, and the revenue from the land sale supported the construction of a new house at Gamma Delta Chi's current location.<ref name="gdx_history">Gamma Delta Chi (2007).

The Zeta Chapter of [[Psi Upsilon]] International Fraternity for Men (''"Psi U"'') was founded at Dartmouth in 1842, the first fraternity at Dartmouth College.  In 1907, Psi Upsilon built the [[framing (construction)|wood frame]] house it still occupies, designed by noted [[New Jersey]] [[theater]] [[architect]] and Dartmouth alumnus [[Fred Wesley Wentworth]].  Several additions during the latter half of the twentieth century greatly improved the structure, which houses twenty or more resident brothers each year.  The house most recently underwent substantial renovations during the spring of 2006.  [[F.

==Sororities==
The single-sex female-only sororities at Dartmouth College are largely organized and represented to the College through the Panhellenic Council. The Panhellenic Council is a student-led governance organization that assists the member Greek organizations by promoting values, education, leadership, friendships, cooperation and citizenship.

Epsilon Kappa Theta (''"EKT," "Theta"'') at Dartmouth College was founded in January 1982 as the Epsilon Kappa colony of the [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] national sorority.  Epsilon Kappa was the 100th colony of the sorority.  The sorority initially met in a wide variety of locations, including the basement of the college president's house.  In 1984, the sorority moved into Brewster Hall, a College-owned house that had previously been used as an International House and later as temporary housing for the [[#Kappa Delta Espilon (<U+039A><U+0394><U+0395>)|Alpha Chi Omega]] sorority.  In 1992, the sisters of the Epsilon Kappa chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta found the strict national rules and the primarily [[Christian]] religious readings and rituals of the organization to be antithetical to the spirit of [[feminism]] and inclusivity that the chapter desired.  The national organization was unhappy with the colony's decision to disobey their rules and their failure to follow the sorority's rituals.  On [[May 4]], [[1992]], the Dartmouth chapter notified the Kappa Alpha Theta national organization of its unanimous vote to disaffiliate and become a local sorority.  The national organization revoked the charter of Epsilon Kappa. The Dartmouth women chose the new name Epsilon Kappa Theta.<ref name="epsilonkappatheta">Epsilon Kappa Theta (2007).

Alpha Theta was founded as a local fraternity named Iota Sigma Upsilon on [[March 3]], [[1920]], by a group of seven students.  In 1921 the fraternity received a charter as the Alpha Theta chapter of [[Theta Chi]].  [[John Sloan Dickey]], later President of the College, joined the fraternity in 1928 and was elected house president only two weeks later, while still a pledge.  Eight brothers of Theta Chi died in a tragic accident on the morning of [[February 25]], [[1934]], when the metal [[chimney]] of the building's old [[coal]] [[furnace]] blew out in the night and the residence filled with poisonous [[carbon monoxide]] gas.<ref name="time1934"/>  Alpha Theta was one of the first collegiate fraternities in the United States to break from its national organization over civil rights issues.  In 1951, while Dickey served as President of the College, the student body passed a resolution calling on all fraternities to eliminate racial discrimination from their constitutions.  The Theta Chi national organization's constitution contained a clause limiting membership in fraternity to "[[Caucasian race|Caucasian]]s" only.  On [[April 24]], [[1952]], the members of the Dartmouth chapter voted unanimously to stop recognizing the racial clause in Theta Chi's constitution.  Upon learning that the Dartmouth delegation to Theta Chi's national convention later that year planned to raise questions about the clause, the Alpha Theta chapter was derecognized by the national organization on [[July 25]], [[1952]].  The house reincorporated as a local fraternity and adopted the name Alpha Theta.  Alpha Theta was also one of the first all-male fraternities to admit female members.  In 1972, Dartmouth admitted the first class of female students and officially became a coeducational institution.  Alpha Theta also voted to become coeducational.  After a few years, most of the women in the fraternity had become inactive and the house voted to become single-sex male-only again on [[November 10]], [[1976]].  The house returned to a coeducational membership policy in 1980.<ref name="bronner">Bronner, Geoffrey and Robinson, Chris(1999).

[[The Tabard (fraternity)|The Tabard]] at Dartmouth College was founded in 1857 as a local fraternity for students in the [[Chandler Scientific School]] named Phi Zeta Mu.  In 1893, as the Chandler School was absorbed by Dartmouth, the house sought to associate itself with a national fraternity and was granted a charter as the Eta Eta chapter of [[Sigma Chi]] national fraternity.  The Dartmouth chapter dissociated from the national organization in 1960 when the Sigma Chi membership policies continued to discriminate against minorities.  The new local fraternity briefly used the name Sigma Epsilon Chi, and included those Greek letters in a [[wrought iron]] [[handrail|railing]] on their residence.  The fraternity later chose to use the name The Tabard, but retained use of the Greek letters.  The new name was inspired by [[The Tabard]], a fictitious [[London]] inn described in the General Prologue of the ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].<ref name="jacob">Jacob, Jess and Kung, David (1997).

In 1997, the Tabard approved new membership policies that affirmed their policies of non-discrimination on the basis of [[race]], [[gender]], or [[sexual orientation]] and further removed [[self-selection]] from the pledging process. The Tabard actively cultivates a reputation as one of the more [[liberalism|liberal]] organizations on campus with its policies and support of inclusivity and personal freedoms.  Members consider wearing clothing with the Greek letters <U+03A3><U+0395>X, a reference to [[human sexuality]], as reaffirming the house's liberal beliefs.

In 1926, the local fraternity became the Dartmouth chapter of Delta Upsilon, a national fraternity.  The fraternity dissociated from the national in 1966, and adopted the name Foley House.  Foley House was one of the six local Greek organizations that became coeducational in 1972.  In 1981, the organization decided to drop its association with the Greek system entirely and became one of the Affinity Housing programs offered by the College, available to any student interested in [[housing cooperative|cooperative housing]].<ref name="dglc"/>

===Delta Phi Epsilon (<U+0394><U+03A6><U+0395>)===
[[Delta Phi Epsilon]] was founded at Dartmouth College in 1984 as the Epsilon Alpha chapter the national sorority.  The sorority was derecognized by the College in June, 1989, when it failed to maintain an active membership of at least 35 students.<ref name="sack">Sack, Jennifer (1993). "Houses in jeopardy; Plagued by low membership, some fraternities look to fall rush".  ''[[The Dartmouth]]''.  June 1, 1993.</ref>  The Dartmouth chapter made an effort to revive itself by separating from the national in 1990 to became Pi Sigma Psi, a local sorority, but dissolved soon thereafter.<ref name="dglc"/>

===Delta Psi Delta (<U+0394><U+03A8><U+0394>)===
Delta Psi Delta was established at Dartmouth College in 1950 as the Dartmouth chapter of [[#Tau Epsilon Phi (<U+03A4><U+0395><U+03A6>)|Tau Epsilon Phi]], a national fraternity. The Dartmouth chapter dissociated from the national in 1969, and reformed itself as the [[#Harold Parmington Foundation (HPF)|Harold Parmington Foundation]].  Faced with falling membership in 1981, the fraternity reformed itself with a more traditional Greek letter name, Delta Psi Delta, and opened its membership to women as well as men.  Faced with critically low enrollment, Delta Psi Delta finally dissolved in 1991.<ref name="dglc"/>  The local, coeducational fraternity at Dartmouth was not associated with either the local sorority at [[Carleton College]]<ref name="carleton">[http://deltapsideltagirls.tripod.com/ Delta Psi Delta] at [[Carleton College]] official web site.

===Zeta Beta Chi (<U+0396><U+0392><U+03A7>)===
Zeta Beta Chi was founded in 1984 as a local sorority named Alpha Beta. In 1986, the sorority gained a charter as the Dartmouth chapter of [[Delta Gamma]], a national sorority.  In 1997, the sorority voted to go local again, and reformed as Zeta Beta Chi. Plagued with low membership, the sorority was already on a marginal financial footing in 1998, when a College inspection during the summer discovered [[mercury (element)|mercury]] contamination in the sorority's [[basement]], the former house of [[Arthur Sherburne Hardy]].  The College closed the building for the remainder of the year, negatively impacting fall rush.  The sorority announced its dissolution in December 1998.<ref name="bubriski">Bubriski, Mark and Semon, Kascha (1998).

===Harold Parmington Foundation (HPF)===
The Harold Parmington Foundation was a local fraternity founded in 1970 after the Dartmouth chapter of [[#Tau Epsilon Phi (<U+03A4><U+0395><U+03A6>)|Tau Epsilon Phi]] dissociated from its national organization.  The new local fraternity continued to reside in 15 Webster Avenue, the house now occupied by the  [[#Epsilon Kappa Theta (<U+0395><U+039A><U+0398>)|Epsilon Kappa Theta]] sorority.  With only one member each from the classes of 1983 and 1984, the fraternity reorganized itself as a coeducational fraternity named [[#Delta Psi Delta (<U+0394><U+03A8><U+0394>)|Delta Psi Delta]].  <ref name="halpert">Halpert, Dave (2007).

===Kappa Alpha Psi (<U+039A><U+0391><U+03A8>)===
[[Kappa Alpha Psi]] at Dartmouth College was founded in 1987 as the Mu Chi chapter of the national fraternity.  Kappa Alpha Psi was the second historically African-American fraternity at Dartmouth College.  Its membership was active through at least the end of the 1990s.  The Kappa Alpha Psi national currently lists the Mu Chi chapter as inactive.<ref name="kappaalphapsi">Kappa Alpha Psi (2007).

===Lambda Chi Alpha (<U+039B><U+03A7><U+0391>)===
[[Lambda Chi Alpha]] was founded at Dartmouth College in 1914 as the Theta Zeta chapter of the national fraternity.  Faced with insurmountable financial stress during the [[Great Depression]], the Dartmouth chapter dissolved in 1932.<ref name="dglc"/>

===Xi Kappa Chi (<U+039E><U+039A><U+03A7>)===
Xi Kappa Chi was originally established at Dartmouth in 1980 as the Zeta Mu chapter of [[Alpha Chi Omega]], a national sorority.  The sorority dissociated from the national organization in 1990 and became a local sorority named Xi Kappa Chi.  Faced with low membership in 1993, the local sorority considered an affiliation with [[Phi Mu]], a national sorority, as a possibility of attracting more new members hesitant to rush a small local sorority.  The Phi Mu national organization sent representatives to Dartmouth in April, 1993, but based on their report, the Phi Mu national council voted against a Dartmouth chapter.  Xi Kappa Chi was dissolved by the Dartmouth Panhellenic Council in 1993.<ref name="amann">Amann, Amanada A. (1993). "New sorority will replace Xi Kappa Chi". ''[[The Dartmouth]]''.

===Pi Lambda Phi (<U+03A0><U+039B><U+03A6>)===
The Pi chapter of the national fraternity [[Pi Lambda Phi]] was established at Dartmouth College in 1924.  The membership of the Dartmouth chapter was predominantly [[Jew]]ish.  About half of the College's fraternities at the time had national constitutions that explicitly forbade membership to Jews, and for many of the other chapters, it was an informal policy to exclude membership to Jewish students.  The national constitution of Pi Lambda Phi expressly accepted members of all [[religion]]s.  Pi Lambda Phi was not initially accepted by the Dartmouth Greek community, and efforts in 1924 and 1925 to gain formal admission into the Interfraternity Council failed.  The fraternity was finally recognized in the spring of 1927.<ref name="gerry">Gerry, Saray (1997). "A history of Jewish life and culture on the Dartmouth campus".  ''[[The Dartmouth]]''.  Nov. 7, 1997.</ref>  The fraternity's first residence, purchased in 1924, was a building on South Street originally occupied by a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church.  The fraternity would reside there until 1961, when it moved to a house north of Webster Avenue on Occom Ridge.  The chapter dissolved in 1971.<ref name="meacham"/>

===Sigma Alpha Mu (<U+03A3><U+0391><U+039C>)===
[[Sigma Alpha Mu]] was established at Dartmouth College in 1930 as the Sigma Upsilon chapter of the national fraternity.  At the time, the Sigma Alpha Mu national limited membership in the organization to Jewish men.  Sigma Alpha Mu placed more emphasis on the observances of [[Judaism]] than did the other predominantly Jewish fraternity on campus, [[#Pi Lambda Phi (<U+03A0><U+039B><U+03A6>)|Pi Lambda Phi]], and had difficulty attracting the interest of most mainstream Jewish students on campus.<ref name="gerry"/>  The Dartmouth chapter dissolved in 1935, during the Great Depression.<ref name="dglc"/>

===Tau Epsilon Phi (<U+03A4><U+0395><U+03A6>)===
[[Tau Epsilon Phi]] was established at Dartmouth College in 1950 as the Epsilon Delta chapter of the national fraternity. The Dartmouth chapter dissociated from the national in 1969, and voted to call itself the [[#Harold Parmington Foundation (HPF)|Harold Parmington Foundation]].<ref name="dglc"/>

===Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI)===
[[Phi Gamma Delta]] was founded at Dartmouth College as the Delta Upsilon chapter of the national fraternity in 1901.  The Dartmouth chapter seceded from the national fraternity in 1965, and adopted the new name of Phoenix.  The new local fraternity dissolved in 1971.<ref name="dglc"/>  The fraternity has no association with the Phoenix all-female [[Dartmouth College student groups#Senior societies|senior society]] founded at Dartmouth in 1984.

===Phi Sigma Psi (<U+03A6><U+03A3><U+03A8>)===
Phi Sigma Psi (''"Phi Psi"'') traces its heritage at Dartmouth College to the Beta Psi local fraternity, founded in 1895.  Beta Psi became the New Hampshire Alpha chapter of [[Phi Kappa Psi]] in 1896.  The Dartmouth chapter dissociated from the national in 1967, adopting the new name Phi Sigma Psi.  Phi Sigma Psi was one of the six fraternities that adopted a formal coeducational membership policy in 1972.  In the late 1980s, the membership began referring to the organization as "Phi Psi/Panarchy".  The fraternity changed its name to [[Dartmouth College student groups#Panarchy|The Panarchy]] in 1991.<ref name="orosz">Orosz, Matt (2000).  [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~panarchy/about.htm "Panarchy: About"].  Retrieved Mar. 21, 2007.</ref>  In 1993, the College began a program for "undergraduate societies" as open-membership alternatives to the Greek system.  In September 1993, the members of Panarchy voted to disaffiliate from the Greek system and became the first of two [[Dartmouth College student groups#Undergraduate societies|Undergraduate Societies]].<ref name="king">King, Kristen (1993).
