''Dragon Quest'''s North American name was changed due to a trademark conflict with the [[role-playing game]] ''[[DragonQuest]]'', which was published by veteran wargame publisher [[Simulations Publications|SPI]] in the 1980s until the company's [[bankruptcy]] in 1982 and purchase by [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], which then published it as an alternate line to ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' until 1987.<ref name="spy">{{cite web | title=The GameSpy Hall of Fame: Dragon Warrior  | work=Gamespy | url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/492/492001p1.html | accessmonthday=May 29 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> In 2003, Square Enix registered the ''Dragon Quest'' [[trademark]] in the [[United States|US]], signalling the end of the ''Dragon Warrior'' moniker.

==Overview==
During the mid-1980s, ''Dragon Quest'' was created by [[Yuuji Horii]], who has been the scenario director since. The series monster and character designs, as well as box art, were by famed ''[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]'' [[manga]] artist, [[Akira Toriyama]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Interview with Yuji Horii on DQ 8 | author= | year=2005 | url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3140772 | accessdate=September 24 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> All of the [[video game music|music]] for the ''Dragon Quest'' series has been composed by [[Koichi Sugiyama]].<ref name="design">{{cite web | title=The Designers Of Dragon Quest | work=IGN | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/379/379052p1.html | accessmonthday=May 29 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> When Horii first created ''Dragon Quest'', most people doubted that a fantasy series with swords and dungeons instead of science fiction would become popular in Japan, but the series has become a phenomenon there.<ref name="euro" />

The first six Dragon Quest games' stories are divided into two [[Trilogy|trilogies]]. The first three games of the series tell the story of the legendary hero known as [[Erdrick|Roto]] (also known as Erdrick or Loto in the American NES and GBC versions, respectively). ''Dragon Quest IV-VI'' are based around a castle in the sky called [[Zenithia]], and are referred to as the ''Tenku'' in Japan, meaning [[Heaven]]. The main series from ''[[Dragon Warrior VII|Dragon Quest VII]]'' on are independent of each other and stand alone.<ref>{{cite web | author=Matt Weiss | year=2002 | title=Dragon Warrior 7 review | url=http://www.gamecritics.com/review/dragonwarr7/main.php | work= | accessdate=September 23 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

The games themselves feature a number of religious overtones--saving the game (in later games) and reviving characters who have died is performed by clergy in churches. [[Bishop]]s are often seen wandering around the overworld of ''[[Dragon Quest Monsters|Dragon Warrior Monsters]]'' and have the ability to heal. The final enemy in some of the ''Dragon Quest'' games is known as the Demon Lord. For instance, in ''[[Dragon Warrior VII]]'', the Demon Lord, known as Orgodemir in that particular game, is the final [[boss (video game)|boss]], and there is also a [[sidequest]] to battle God himself.<ref name="historyof" /> 

''Dragon Quest'' is such a [[cultural]] phenomenon in Japan that there are live-action [[ballet]]s (being the first video game to inspire a ballet),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elecplay.com/feature.php?article=11802 |title=Guinness Book of World Records Gamer's Edition 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-04 |author=Jason MacIsaac |work=[[The Electric Playground]] |publisher=Greedy Productions Ltd}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |title=Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2008 |series=[[Guinness World Records]] |date=[[2008-03-11]] |publisher=Guinness |language=English |isbn=978-1-904994-21-3 |pages= |chapter=}}</ref> [[performance|musical concerts]], and [[audio CD]]s based on the ''Dragon Quest'' universe.<ref name="symph">{{cite web | author=Ed Lewis | year=2004 | title=The Dragon Quest Symphony | work=IGN | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/475/475818p1.html | accessmonthday=May 29 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>  <!-- Dubious, poorly sourced statement: There is a Japanese federal law stating that the Dragon Quest games can only be released on Saturday or Sunday, so as to avoid tens of thousands of work and school-related absences nationwide.<ref>{{cite web | title=State of the RPG: GameCube | work= IGN | url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/634/634965p1.html | accessmonthday=October 9 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> --> The [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] has performed for several ''Dragon Quest'' music [[album]]s.<ref>{{cite web | title=Dragon Quest III Symphonic Suite Review | work=RPGFan | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/dq3-ss/ | accessmonthday=May 29 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> It was the first video game series to have its music performed live by an orchestra.<ref>{{cite web | author=Matthew Belinkie | year=1999 | title=Video Game Music | url=http://www.vgmusic.com/vgpaper.shtml| work= | accessdate=September 10 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Since 1987, music from Dragon Quest has been performed annually in Japan in concert halls.<ref>{{cite web | author=Sam Kennedy | year=2005 | title=Dragon Quest vs. America | url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3146024 | work= | accessdate=September 10 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> In Japan, due to complaints of mass absenteeism from schools and places of work, Enix changed its policy of releasing new ''Dragon Quest'' games on weekdays.<ref>{{cite web |title=Student Arrested In Dragon Quest Death Threat | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=5000 | accessmonthday=July 21 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

===Outside Japan===
''Dragon Quest'' is not nearly as successful outside Japan, having been eclipsed by ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' and other RPG series. Because of [[Enix|Enix America Corporation]]'s closure in the mid 1990's, ''[[Dragon Quest V]]'' and ''[[Dragon Quest VI]]'' were never officially released in [[North America]]. In [[Europe]], none of the games except ''[[Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King]]'' and ''[[Dragon Warrior Monsters (video game)|Dragon Warrior Monsters]]'' have seen release.{{Fact|date=May 2008}} The lack of official [[Software localization|localizations]] for ''Dragon Quest'' games has inspired many [[fan translation of video games|fan translation]] projects.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2007 | title=ROMHacking.net search | url=http://www.romhacking.net/?genre=&platform=&status=&languageid=12&perpage=20&page=translations&transsearch=Go&title=dragon+quest&author= | work= | accessdate=September 10 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> The legal status of these translations, while untested in court, are considered to be [[Fan translation of computer and video games#Legal issues|illegal]].  The completed fan translation projects include ''[[Dragon Quest V]]'' and the Super Famicom remake of ''[[Dragon Quest I & II]]''.

The first four ''Dragon Warrior'' titles suffered from substantial [[censorship]] in their North American localizations, largely in keeping with [[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]]'s content guidelines at the time, which placed severe restrictions on religious iconography and mature content. Both graphics and text were edited, replacing [[coffin]]s with [[ghost]]s, [[cross]]es with [[Pentagram|five-point stars]], and "Priest" with "Healer," to name but a few. The "puff-puff massage" scenario was also taken out of the first two games. However, the graphics, sound and menus of ''Dragon Warrior'' and ''Dragon Warrior II'' were given an upgrade for American release. When these games were remade for the [[Game Boy Color]], many of these censorships were taken out.<ref>{{cite web | author=Shahed Ahmed | year=2000 | title=Enix Comments on DQ VII | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/dragonwarrior7/news_2643279.html | work= | accessdate=September 12 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Since ''Dragon Warrior VII'', the games have been kept similar to their original versions when going through localization.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2001 | title=E3 2001 Interview | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/features/e32k1-enix/index.html | work= | accessdate=September 23 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Only two titles in the series have been released in Europe. The first was ''[[Dragon Warrior Monsters (video game)|Dragon Warrior Monsters]]'' published by ''[[Eidos Interactive]]'';{{Fact|date=May 2008}} the second was ''[[Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King]]'', but the game was marketed as ''Dragon Quest: The Journey of the Cursed King''. However, the series is one of Square Enix's flagship titles, and it is currently planning to release at least four upcoming installments in the series outside Japan. With the Square Enix merge in 2003, the number of places that ''Dragon Quest'' games are released has greatly increased.<ref name="euro">{{cite web | author= | year=2007 | title=Interview with Yuji Horii at EuroGamer.com | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=62489 | work= | accessdate=September 12 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

On May 20, 2008, Square Enix announced localizations of the Nintendo DS remakes of Dragon Quest IV, V, and VI, known collectively as the Zenithia trilogy, with the opening of the North American website.<ref>[http://na.square-enix.com/zenithia]</ref> On the following day a press release from Square Enix confirmed that the games will be released in Europe.<ref>{{cite web | year=2008 | title=Dragon Quest - Zenithia Trilogy Announced For Nintendo DS | url=http://ds-x2.com/news/Dragon%2BQuest%2B-%2C11310,11310 | work= | accessdate=May 21 | accessyear=2008}}</ref> With this announcement, all the main games in the Dragon Quest series will now have seen release outside Japan at least once. In Europe, the series installments are not numbered.

==Common elements==
===Gameplay===
[[Image:Dragon warrior 3 battle screen.gif|thumb|Typical battle from ''[[Dragon Warrior III]]'']]
The ''Dragon Quest'' system is similar to the basis of the ''[[Ultima]]'' and ''[[Wizardry]]'' video game systems, as well as games like ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', which came later. The game player's party walks into a town and buys weapons, armor, and items in order to defeat monsters easily. When the player's party is out of the town, the party is vulnerable to random monster attacks. When players encounter monsters, they have several options from which to choose through menus. The player can attack and defeat the enemy with weapons, magic, or items. The player can also attempt to run away from the fight. However, this option is not available during a [[boss (video game)|boss]] battle. After a player wins a battle by defeating all the monsters, the player's party members gain [[experience point]]s (EXP) in order to gain new levels. When a certain character gains a new level, the stats of the character are upgraded.<ref name="np7">Editors of Nintendo Power: ''Nintendo Power July - August, 1989; issue 7'' (in English). Nintendo of America, Tokuma Shoten Publishing, 39-50.</ref>

When the player's party dies in battle, the group will lose half of their gold and the leader of the party warps back to the nearest church. The leader then needs to pay a priest to revive his/her party members. More recent games in the series have banks in many towns that allow the player to store gold, which prevents it from being lost when the party dies.

To save one's progress, the player must visit a Church (also known as a House of Healing in early North American versions) and talk to a priest or nun. In early versions of ''Dragon Quest'', the player must visit a king in order to save his or her progress<ref name="np7"/> (this does not include the first two ''Dragon Quest'' titles for the Famicom, which use a password system).<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2001 | title=Dragon Quest history | url=http://www.woodus.com/den/general/history.php | work= | accessdate=September 12 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

''[[Dragon Warrior III]]'', ''[[Dragon Quest VI]]'', and ''[[Dragon Warrior VII]]'' feature several classes to choose for the party members.<ref name="historyof" /> Typical classes include the [[Fighter (character class)|fighter]], [[Paladin (character class)|paladin]], and [[Wizard (character class)|mage]]. Each installment possesses its own particular set of classes.

The typical ''Dragon Quest'' plot involves a certain villain to be defeated at the end of the game, usually one who threatens the world in some way. However, the plotline often consists of smaller stories involving different NPC's the player meets as the adventure goes on.<ref name="hgone">{{cite web | author=Kurt Kalata | year=2007 | title=Dragon Warrior/ Dragon Quest | url=http://hg101.classicgaming.gamespy.com/dragonquest/dragonquest.htm | work= | accessdate=January 29 | accessyear=2008}}</ref>

===Monsters===
[[Image:Rockett.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Rocket, a [[Slime (Dragon Quest)|slime]] starring in ''[[Dragon Quest Heroes]]''.]]
The series features several recurring monsters, such as Slimes, Drackies, Shadows, Mummies, Trick Bags, and Dragons.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2006 | title=Dragon Quest II monsters | url=http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/nes/dw2/enemies.shtml | work= | accessdate=September 16 | accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2006 | title=Dragon Quest III monsters | url=http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/nes/dw3/enemies.shtml | work= | accessdate=September 16 | accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2006 | title=Dragon Quest IV monsters | url=http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/nes/dw4/enemies.shtml | work= | accessdate=September 16 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Many of the monsters have been designed by Akira Toriyama. Many of the ''Dragon Quest'' monsters have been featured in the ''[[Dragon Quest Monsters]]'' series of games, which allows the player to catch monsters and use them in battle. This idea is also used in ''Dragon Quest V'', although humans fight in battle as well.

The official [[mascot]] of the ''Dragon Quest'' series is the '''[[Slime (Dragon Quest)|Slime]]'''. A Slime is a small blob with a face, shaped like an [[onion]] or [[Hershey's Kiss]]. It has appeared in every ''Dragon Quest'' game and it is usually one of the first monsters the player encounters.<ref>{{cite web | author=Cary Woodham | year=2006 | title=Rocket Slime review at Gamerdad | url=http://www.gamerdad.com/detail.cfm?itemID=3412 | work= | accessdate=September 9 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> The Slime's popularity has netted it two [[spinoff]]s: ''[[Slime MoriMori Dragon Quest: Sh<U+014D>geki no Shippo Dan|Slime MoriMori Dragon Quest]]'' and ''[[Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime]]''. They also make a significant showing in the Japanese manga and two-episode anime [[Dragon Half]].

In 1989, a manga was published by Enix called ''Dragon Quest Monster Story'', which had nothing to do with ''[[Dragon Quest Monsters]]''.<ref name="besu" /> This book featured short stories about various ''Dragon Quest'' monsters and came with a poster that featured the "families" of monsters.

==Recurring themes==
===Loto===
'''Loto''', also known as '''Roto''' or '''Erdrick''' (in the NES localizations) (Japanese: <U+30ED><U+30C8>), is a legendary hero from the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series. The first three Dragon Quest games make up the "Loto trilogy," which are all connected to the legend of Loto. He is known in the game as the hero who freed Alefgard from darkness.<ref name="dw_manual">(1989) Nintendo, Enix Corporation ''Dragon Warrior Instruction Manual'' (in English).</ref> The name Erdrick was first mentioned in the [[English language|English]] [[localization]], ''[[Dragon Warrior]]'' in which the player is referred to as Erdrick's descendent.<ref name="np7_40">Editors of Nintendo Power: ''Nintendo Power July - August, 1989; issue 7'' (in English). Nintendo of America, Tokuma Shoten Publishing, 40.</ref> Erdrick<U+2019>s [[legend]] was completed with the 1991 release of ''[[Dragon Warrior III]]''. 

In ''[[Dragon Warrior]]'', Loto was the ancestor of the Hero. The Hero follows in the footsteps of Loto to ultimately reach the Dragonlord's Castle and confront the [[Dragonlord (Dragon Quest)|Dragonlord]]. In ''[[Dragon Warrior II]]'', the heroes are descendants of Loto, and also of the Hero from ''Dragon Warrior''.<ref name="dw2_manual">Enix Corporation ''Unveiled Secrets of Dragon Warrior II'' (in English) Enix America Corporation.</ref><ref name="np16_67">Editors of Nintendo Power: ''Nintendo Power September/October, 1990; issue 16'' (in English). Nintendo of America, Tokuma Shoten Publishing, 67.</ref> At the end of ''Dragon Warrior III'', the King of Alefgard bestows upon the Hero <U+201C>the Order of Loto<U+201D>, the country<U+2019>s highest honor reserved only for true heroes. While this implies Loto is merely a title, it isn't possible to name the Hero Loto at the beginning of ''Dragon Warrior III''. In ''[[Dragon Warrior III]]'', the origins of the hero Loto are revealed; therefore, the [[chronology|chronological order]] of the first three games is ''III'', ''I'', ''II''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Brad Shoemaker | year=2001 | title=Dragon Warrior III preview | url=http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/rpg/dragonwarrior3/review.html | work= | accessdate=September 16 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>  This chronology is further evidenced in the naming of the hero's weapon, armor and shield.  After the events of III, the heroes armaments are renamed as the Loto (or Erdrick) Sword and Armor in I and II.

The Hero, originally known as Erdrick to many English-speaking players, is also known by two other names. In the original [[Japanese language]] games (''[[Dragon Quest]]''), Erdrick is known exclusively by the name '''Roto''', which is also used by some [[Import (international trade)|import]] [[gamer]]s. Another [[romanization]] of the name is '''Loto''', which was used in place of Erdrick when [[Enix|Enix America, Inc.]] re-released ''Dragon Warrior I'', ''II'', and ''III'' on the [[Game Boy Color]]. This was most likely used because the Japanese character (<U+30ED>) is not strictly an R or an L sound, but lies somewhere in between.  Therefore it is properly [[transliterate]]d either way.

In the original ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'', Square parodies Dragon Quest by displaying a grave for Erdrick in the town of Elfland.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=1999 | title=Final Fantasy screenshot | url=http://www.vbfx.com/mirrors/www.planetnintendo.com/ff1/scrshots/snap062.gif | work= | accessdate=September 16 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> In retaliation, Enix hid a Cid grave in ''Dragon Quest III''.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2000 | title=Dragon Warrior.com News August 2000 | url=http://www.dragon-warrior.com/News/August_2000.shtml9 | work= | accessdate=September 13 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> A parody of Erdrick's sword is wielded by [[Recurring character names of Final Fantasy#Gilgamesh|Gilgamesh]] in ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'': it is referred to as the "Wyrmhero Blade" (In the Japanese version, it is called "Tolo Sword").

===Zenithia===
'''Zenithia''', also called '''Zenith Castle''' or simply '''Zenith''', is the name of a fictional sky castle from the series. The first appearance is in ''[[Dragon Warrior IV]]'', and the castle is one of several elements from ''[[Dragon Warrior IV|Dragon Quest IV]]'', ''[[Dragon Quest V|V]]'', and ''[[Dragon Quest VI|VI]]'' which suggest the three games are linked as a [[trilogy]]; this group is often called the ''Tenk<U+016B>'' (Japanese for Heaven), or the ''Tenk<U+016B> no Shiro'' (''Castle in the Sky'') trilogy.<ref>{{cite web | author=Jonathan Creswell | year=2007 | title=Dragon Quest IV, V, VI | url=http://www.britishgaming.co.uk/?p=2306 | work= | accessdate=September 17 | accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2007 | title=Dragon Quest IV, V, VI confirmed | url=http://www.siliconera.com/2007/07/30/dragon-quest-iv-v-vi-remakes-confirmed/| work= | accessdate=September 17 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Yuuji Horii explained that the trilogy was never intended: "Each Dragon Quest title represents a fresh start and a new story, so I don't see too much of a connection between the games in the series. I guess it could be said that the imagination of players has brought the titles together in a certain fashion."<ref name="julynp">Editors of Nintendo Power: Nintendo Power July, 2008; issue 7 (in English). Future US Inc, 50-57. Retrieved [[June 1]], [[2008]]</ref>

In ''Dragon Warrior IV'', Zenithia can be accessed by climbing the Tower near Gottside, which goes as far up to the sky. It is directly above the entrance to the world of darkness. In ''Dragon Quest V'', Zenithia has fallen into a lake south of Elheaven. This happened when the ''Golden Orb'', half of a set of magical orbs that supported the castle in the sky, fell from its place. Once recovered and returned to Master Dragon, Zenithia will rise again. This time, the castle can move freely around the sky. In ''Dragon Quest VI'', Zenith Castle is sealed away by Demon Lord Durran, and a giant hole is left behind in its place in the ''Dream World''. After the Dream World returns to its natural state, Zenith Castle is the only part of it that can still be seen floating above the real world.A castle in the ''[[Dragon Warrior III]]'' remakes for [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]]/[[Game Boy Color]] is also called '''Zenith''', though the layout differs from the castle from the Tenku series.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Prima Games |title=Dragon Warrior III Official Strategy Guide |year=2001 |publisher=Prima Publishing |isbn=0-7615-3638-8 |pages=87-89}}</ref>

Square Enix has released the Celestial Sword (the Zenithian Sword) and Sword of Ramias as part of their Dragon Quest Legend Items series - miniature collectible toy replicas of artifacts from the ''Dragon Quest'' universe.

At a press conference in Japan celebrating the 20th anniversary of Dragon Quest, Square Enix announced that Dragon Quest IX is in development for the [[Nintendo DS]] handheld gaming system. The full title is reported to be '''Dragon Quest IX: Defenders of the Sky''' (or ''Protectors of the Starry Sky'', depending on translation), and is the next main installment in the series by [[Level-5]], not a spin-off or side quest. This will be the first installment of the series that will be exclusive to a handheld system rather than a home console.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dragon Quest IX Q&A | url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/750/750610p1.html | accessdate=September 9 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Notably, this would have also been the first installment to feature real-time combat as well as four player [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]] over [[wi-fi]], but it was later reported that the system had been changed back to a turn based format.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dragon Quest IX delayed | url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/48660 | accessdate=September 9 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

===Spinoffs===
The franchise also includes several spin-off series, including ''[[Dragon Quest Monsters]]'' and ''[[Slime MoriMori Dragon Quest]]'', as well as arcade games like the Japanese game ''[[Dragon Quest: Monster Battle Road]]''.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2007 | title=Dragon Quest castle erected | url=http://www.japannewsreview.com/entertainment/games/20070715page_id=711 | work= | accessdate=September 9 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Several games in both the [[Mystery Dungeon]] and [[Itadaki Street]] series have characters from the Dragon Quest games.

In 1993, [[Chunsoft]] created a [[Super Famicom]] game for Torneko Taloon, originally known as simply Taloon to American gamers, a [[fictional character]] first appearing in ''[[Dragon Warrior IV]]''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Matthew Williamson | year=2005 | title=Fushigi no Dungeon 2 | url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2006/05/column_parallax_memories_fushi.php | work= | accessmonthday=September 16 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> The game, titled ''[[Torneko no Daib<U+014D>ken: Fushigi no Dungeon]]'' which loosely translates to ''Torneko's Great Adventure: Mysterious Dungeon'', was a [[roguelike]] which continued Torneko's story from ''[[Dragon Quest IV]]'', where he wished to make his store grow even further by venturing into mysterious dungeons and getting more items for stock. It was very successful, both on namesake and quality.

A direct sequel to ''Torneko no Daibouken'' came out in Japan and the United States in 2000 called ''[[Torneko: The Last Hope]]''(''Torneko no Daibouken 2'' in Japan). This game was very similar to the first, but it is considered much easier by comparison.<ref>{{cite web | author=Jeff Gertsmann | year=2000 | title=GameSpot review | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/tornekothelasthope/review.html | work= | accessdate=September 16 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> It was received well enough in Japan to warrant a third direct sequel, on the [[PlayStation 2]], titled ''Torneko no Daibouken: Fushigi no Dungeon 3''. Both the second and third Torneko games have been ported to the [[Game Boy Advance]].

Following the success of Torneko, many other ''[[Mysterious Dungeon|Fushigi no Dungeon]]'' games were published by various companies (most of which developed by Chunsoft), among the best known are ''[[Chocobo#Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon|Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon]]'' and ''Nightmare of Druaga: Mysterious Dungeon''. The most recent additions to the genre are ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team|Pok<U+00E9>mon Mystery Dungeon]]'' and ''[[Dragon Quest: Sh<U+014D>nen Yangus to Fushigi no Dungeon|Dragon Quest Yangus]]''.

A card-based [[arcade game]], known as ''[[Dragon Quest: Monster Battle Road]]'' and developed by [[Level-5]], was released exclusively in Japan.<ref>{{cite web | author=Patrick Klepek | year=2006 | title=IGN: Dragon Quest IX Announced for Nintendo DS?! | url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3155838 | work= | accessdate=September 16 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Finally, two spinoffs are played by physically swinging a controller using it as a sword to slash enemies among other things. ''[[Kenshin Dragon Quest: Yomigaerishi Densetsu no Ken|Kenshin Dragon Quest]]'' is a stand alone game which comes with the a toy sword as the controller, and a toy shield containing the game's hardware.<ref>{{cite web | author=Anthony Willsey | year=2006 | title=IGN: Dragon Quest Swords preview | url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/709/709625p1.html | work= | accessdate=September 16 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> ''[[Dragon Quest Swords]]'' is an exclusive [[Wii]] title which uses the motion sensing abilities of the [[Wii Remote]] similarly.

==Development==
Yuuji Horii, Akira Toriyama, and Koichi Sugiyama are the three most well known creators of the ''Dragon Quest'' series.<ref name="design" /> Each of them has worked on each of the main games and are treated almost as celebrities in Japan.<ref name="road" />

In 1982, Enix sponsored a national video game programming contest, which brought much of the ''Dragon Quest'' team together, including Yuuji Horii.<ref name="design" /> The prize of the competition was a trip to America, and a visit to AppleFest '83 in San Francisco, where Horii discovered ''Wizardry''.<ref name="road" /> Koichi Nakamura and Yukinobu Chida, two other winners of the contest, along with Horii, released ''[[The Portopia Serial Murder Case]]'' for the Famicom for Enix. Sugiyama, already famous for jingles and pop songs, impressed with the group's work, sent a postcard to Enix, commenting on the software.<ref name="symph" /> In response, Enix asked him to write music for some of their games. The group then decided to make a [[console role-playing game]], using a combination of ''Wizardry'' and ''Ultima''. Akira Toriyama, who knew Horii through [[Shonen Jump]], was commissioned to illustrate the characters and monsters to separate the game from other RPGs of the time and the ''Dragon Quest'' "team" was born.<ref>{{cite book |editor= |title=Nintendo Power volume 221 |year=2007 |publisher= |isbn= |pages=78-80}}</ref><ref name="historyof">{{cite web | author=Philip Bloom | year=2006 | title=The History of Dragon Quest | url=http://www.rpgland.com/specialfeatures/dqhistory/historyofdragonquest.html | work= | accessdate=September 23 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

''Dragon Quest'' games have been developed by [[Chunsoft]], [[Heart Beat (company)|Heartbeat]], [[Artepiazza]], and starting with ''Dragon Quest VIII'', [[Level-5]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Bryan Boulette | year=2006 | title=Square Enix: Dinosaur or Leader | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/editor/2006/q3/080706aca.html | work= | accessdate=September 24 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Horii's own company, [[Armor Project]], is in charge of the ''Dragon Quest'' games, which were published by Enix and now Square Enix. While Toriyama is the series' character designer, the primary designs are first conceived by Horii, before being handed to Toriyama to re-draw under Horii's supervision.<ref>{{cite web | author=Nich Maragos | date=2005-05-19 | title=Previews: Dragon Quest VIII | url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3140772 | work=[[1UP.com]] | accessdate=April 21 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Dragon Quest'' is often regarded as the most popular video game series in Japan.<ref name="anoop" /><ref name="lindermann" /><ref name="gsyp2" /> Most of the games in the main series as well as the spinoff games have sold over a million copies, some even selling over four million, and sell very quickly.<ref>{{cite web | author=| year=2004 | title=Japanese Platinum Game Chart | url=http://www.the-magicbox.com/topten2.htm | work= | accessdate=September 18 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> For instance, the remake of ''Dragon Quest V'' sold 1.3 million copies in Japan in its first two days, which is a very high number for a remake.<ref>{{cite web | author=Suppai Hitmitsu| year=2004 | title=Dragon Quest V goes platinum| url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/502/502102p1.html| work= | accessdate=September 18 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> In 2006, Japanese gaming magazine [[Famitsu]] readers voted on the hundred best video games of all time.

Although the series is a phenomenon in Japan, the games never garnered as much attention in North America.<ref name="spy" /> Although the first four games to come to America generally received good reviews, it was not until ''Dragon Warrior VII'' was released did ''Dragon Quest'' become critically acclaimed there.<ref name="spy" /> One of the main aspects of the series that critics point out, either positively or negatively, is that the series "never strays from its classic roots".<ref name="gsyp2">{{cite web | author= | year=2005 | title=GameSpy: Dragon Quest 8 Review | url=http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/dragon-warrior-viii/669330p1.html| work= | accessdate=September 19 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Unlike other modern, complex RPGs, ''Dragon Quest'' retains the simple gameplay from the first game, which many critics find refreshing and nostalgic.<ref name="gsyp2" /><ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2005 | title=TotalPlaystation: DQ 8 Review| url=http://totalplaystation.com/ps2/Dragon-Quest-VIII-Journey-of-the-Cursed-King/reviews/481| work= | accessdate=September 19 | accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Chris Kohler | year=2007 | title=Hands-on with Dragon Quest IV | url=http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/09/hands-on-dragon.html#more | work= | accessdate=September 23 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Other critics feel differently about the series, however, and claim that the story, characters, and gameplay have become boring and redundant over the years.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2005 | title=Dragon Quest 8 Review| url=http://www.netjak.com/review.php/1045 | work= | accessdate=September 21 | accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Sophie Chesire | year=2005 | title=Dragon Quest VIII review| url=http://www.thunderboltgames.com/reviews/viewreview.php?rid=931 | work= | accessdate=September 21 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

The original ''Dragon Quest'' game is often claimed to be the birth of the [[console role-playing game]], despite the fact that many others consider ''Final Fantasy'' "more important."<ref name="spy" /> ''Dragon Warrior'' was listed on [[GameSpot|GameSpot's]] list of the 15 most influential games of all time, calling it the "most influential role-playing game of all time" and stated that nearly all RPGs today have roots in its gameplay.<ref>{{cite web | author=| year=2000 | title=GameSpot's 15 most influential| url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p11_01.html | work= | accessdate=September 18 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Aside from the main series of soundtracks, other compilations of ''Dragon Quest'' music have been made, such as ''Dragon Quest Game Music Super Collection Vol. 1''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Damien Thomas | year=2006 | title=Dragon Quest Game Music Super Collection Vol. 1 | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/dqmusic1/index.html | work= | accessdate=September 15 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>
