'''George Low, Sr.''' (1874<U+2013>1950) was a Scottish [[professional golfer]].

==Early life==
Low was born in Carnoustie, Scotland in 1874.  He learned the trade of golf club maker in the workshop of [[Archie Simpson]] in Carnoustie.  He lived in Aberdeen, Scotland for a time and honed his considerable golf skills while living there.  Low emigrated to the United States in 1899 and quickly acclimated himself to the American golf scene by finishing second in the [[1899 U.S. Open (golf)|1899 U.S. Open]] held at [[Baltimore Country Club]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].  In 1900, Low accompanied [[Harry Vardon]] for a portion of his American exhibition tour.  Low won the [[Metropolitan Open]] in 1906 and the [[Florida Open]] three times. In 1906 Low was appointed as the first president of the Eastern Professional Golfer's Association, which predated the [[PGA of America]].

==Golf career==
Low made a name for himself as a club maker at Dyker Meadow Golf Club in [[Brooklyn, New York]], and he took that business with him to [[Baltusrol Golf Club]] in Springfield, New Jersey, where he served as the green superintendent and golf professional for many years. He advertised his business regularly in the golf magazines. Low's biggest challenge as a club maker occurred in March 1909 when the Club's original clubhouse burned down. Low's repair shop was saved, but some 400 sets of members' clubs were destroyed. In those days there were no standardized sets of clubs, and each golfer's assortment of clubs was highly individualized. Low must have suffered the tortures of the damned as he responded to each replacement order, and he must have earned a pretty penny as he did so. But, as one newspaper observed, Low suffered large losses to his own account in the fire so that what he made in sales was partially offset by his losses in the fire.

Low resigned from Baltusrol in October 1925, stating that he intended to start a golf course architecture business with [[Herbert Strong (golfer)|Herbert Strong]], an Englishman who was his counterpart at Apawamis Country Club, [[Rye, New York]].  This planned business venture with Strong, however, failed to materialize.

In 1928 he returned to live in Scotland, however when the stock market [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|crashed in 1929]] he needed to go back to work and in late 1930 he returned to the United States and became the professional at [[Huntingdon Valley Country Club]], located seven miles northeast of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].  At the ripe old age of 60, Low qualified for the [[1934 U.S. Open (golf)|1934 U.S. Open]] at [[Merion Golf Club]] in [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania]]. 

Low died in Clearwater, Florida in 1950.<ref>http://www.baltusrol.org/club/scripts/library/view_document.asp?DN=GEORGE1&GRP=23559&NS=LB</ref>

==Family==
His son, George Low, Jr., born 1912 in Springfield, New Jersey, was a noted golfer and designer of putters.  He was a putting instructor for [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]] and [[Lee Trevino]], among others.
