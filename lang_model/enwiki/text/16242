'''Eug<U+00E8>ne Louis Lami''' ([[January 12]], [[1800]] - [[December 19]], [[1890]]) was a [[France|French]] [[painter]] and [[lithographer]]. He worked at the studio of  [[Horace Vernet]] then studied at the [[<U+00C9>cole des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]] with [[Camille Roqueplan]] and [[Paul Delaroche]] under [[Antoine-Jean Gros]]. While there, he learned [[watercolor]] technique from [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] and would later become a founding member of the [[Society of French Watercolorists]]. Lami's 1881 watercolor titled ''A Couple Embracing'' is at the [[Getty Center|Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles, California]].

Lami began working in lithography and in 1819 produced a set of 40 lithographs depicting the Spanish cavalry. These, plus a collaboration with Vernet on a large set of lithographs titled ''Collections des uniformes des arm<U+00E9>es fran<U+00E7>aises de 1791 <U+00E0> 1814''  helped build a reputation for doing military scenes which transferred to his paintings. His 1829 portrait of the English king, [[Charles I of England]] as he was being led to imprisonment in [[Carisbrooke Castle]] was purchased by King [[Louis-Philippe of France]] and was on display in the [[French National Assembly]] from 1848 to 1969. Today, this work along with his 1840 painting of [[Louise Marie Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de de Bourbon-Penthi<U+00E8>vre]], [[Duc d'Orl<U+00E9>ans|duchesse d'Orl<U+00E9>ans]] in the gardens of the [[Tuileries Palace]] are both in the [[Louvre]]. Lami's painting of the ''[[Battle of New Orleans]]'', depicting the moment of the American victory over the English on January 8, 1815 is in the Louisiana State Museum at [[The Cabildo]] in [[New Orleans]].
