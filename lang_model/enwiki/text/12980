A '''stupa''' (from the [[P<U+0101>li]]) is a type of [[Buddhist]] structure found across the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Asia]] and increasingly in the [[Western World]]. Stupas are known in many Southeast Asian countries as '''chedi''' (from a P<U+0101>li synonym of stupa); in some countries (particularly [[Sri Lanka]]) as '''dagoba''' (from [[Sanskrit]] ''dhatu''- element, component, or relic + ''garbha'' - storehouse or repository); or as '''tope''' (from [[Hindi]] ''top'', derived from Sanskrit ''st<U+016B>pa'', a heap).

The stupa is the earliest Buddhist religious monument and was originally only a simple mound made up of mud or clay, or a [[cairn]] in barren areas, to cover supposed [[relic]]s of the [[Buddha]]. After the <U+2018>passing away<U+2019> of the Buddha his remains were cremated and the ashes divided and buried under eight stupas with two further stupas encasing the urn and the embers. Little is known about these early stupas, particularly since it has not been possible to identify the original ten monuments. However, some later stupas, such as at [[Sarnath]] and [[Sanchi]], seem to be embellishments of earlier mounds. In the third century BC, after his conversion to Buddhism, the emperor [[Ashoka]] had the original stupas opened and the remains distributed among the several thousand stupas he had built. Nevertheless, the stupas at the eight places associated with the life of the Buddha continued to be of particular importance. Accordingly, the importance of a stupa changed from being a funerary monument to being an object of veneration. As a consequence their appearance changed also.

They evolved into large hemispherical mounds with features such as the [[torana]] (gateway), the ''vedica'' (fence-like enclosure evolved from the [[Vedic Civilisation|vedic]] villages), the ''harmika'' (a square platform with railings on top of the stupa), ''chattrayashti'' (the parasol or canopy) and a circumambulatory around the stupa. From the first century BCE onwards, stupas were incorporated into the hall of the [[chaitya]]-griha. 

The oldest known stupa is the [[Dhamek Stupa]] at [[Sanchi]], [[India]], while the tallest is the [[Phra Pathom Chedi]] in [[Nakhon Pathom province|Nakhon Pathom]], [[Thailand]], with a height of 127 metres.[[image:Buddha relics.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Buddha relics from Kanishka's stupa in Peshawar, Pakistan, now in Mandalay, Burma.

The stupa evolved into the [[pagoda]] as Buddhism spread to other Asian countries. The pagoda has varied forms that also include bellshaped and pyramidal ones. Today, in the Western context, there is no clear distinction between the stupa and the pagoda. But in general ''stupa'' is used for a Buddhist structure of India or [[south-east Asia]], while ''pagoda'' refers to a building in [[east Asia]] which can be entered and which may be secular in purpose.

Fundamentally, a stupa is essentially made up of the following five constituents:

a). A square base<br>
b). A hemispherical dome<br>
c). A conical spire<br>
d). A crescent moon<br>
e). A circular disc

Each of these components is rich in metaphoric content and is identified with one of the five cosmic elements said to make up the entire manifested existence. These are earth, water, fire, air and space.

Regional names for stupa include:
* [[Chaitya]] - Nepal
