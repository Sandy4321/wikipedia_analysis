The '''Bristol Bullfinch''' was an experimental [[United Kingdom|British]] military aircraft of the 1920s. Variants were built as both [[parasol wing]] [[monoplane]]s and [[biplane]]s, but proved unsuccessful, only three [[prototype]]s being built.

==Development==
The '''Bullfinch''' was designed by [[Frank Barnwell]], chief designer of the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] as a parasol-wing monoplane single-seat [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]], which was convertible to a two-seat [[biplane]], thus meeting the requirements of the [[Royal Air Force]] for both a single-seat [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] fighter and a two-seat [[reconnaissance]]-fighter. The potential cost savings associated with this concept, which was planned to be powered by the [[Bristol Jupiter|Jupiter]] engine, the rights to which Bristol had just acquired from the bankrupt [[Cosmos Engineering]], interested the [[Air Ministry]], who wrote a specification ([[List of Air Ministry Specifications|Specification 2/21]]) around Barnwell's proposed design, and ordered three prototypes in June 1921.<ref name="mason fighter">{{Cite book|author=Mason, Francis K|title=The British Fighter since 1912|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1992
|isbn= 1-55750-082-7}}</ref> 

The Bullfinch monoplane, or '''Type 52 Bullfinch Mk I''', was a [[Cantilever#In aircraft|cantilever]] parasol monoplane with a welded steel tube [[fuselage]]. The wing was in two halves, joined at the aircraft centreline, with each half tapering from maximum thickness at half span to both the wing root and tips.<ref name="bristol 1910">{{Cite book |author=Barnes, C.H.|title=Bristol Aircraft Since 1910 |edition =First Edition |publisher=Putnam |location= London|year=1964 }}</ref> The wing was wooden in the [[prototype]]s, but was planned to be of metal construction for any subsequent production aircraft. To produce the two-seat fighter-reconnaissance version, the '''Type 53 Bullfinch Mk II''', an extra [[fuselage]] bay was added aft of the pilot containing a [[cockpit]] for the observer, with a cantilever bottom wing attached which compensated for the shift in [[Center of gravity|centre of gravity]] resulting from the lengthened fuselage.

The first prototype, a Type 52 monoplane flew on 6 November 1922, with the second prototype, also a monoplane, flying in May 1923.<ref name="mason fighter"/> After first flying as a monoplane, the third prototype was converted to biplane configuration, flying in that layout on 17 March 1924. While the single-seater demonstrated reasonable performance, the two-seater was overweight, and proved unable to carry the required military load.<ref name="bristol 1910"/> No further production occurred.
