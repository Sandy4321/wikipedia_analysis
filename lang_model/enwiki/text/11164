'''Norman 'Buddy' Oldfield''' (30&nbsp;April 1911, [[Dukinfield]], [[Cheshire]]&ndash;19&nbsp;April 1996, [[Cleveleys]], [[Lancashire]]) was an [[England|English]] [[cricket]]er and [[umpire (cricket)|umpire]] who played in one [[Test cricket|Test]] in 1939. Between 1935 and 1939 he played [[first-class cricket]] for [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]], before the [[Second World War]] interrupted and ended a promising start to his Test career. Oldfield changed clubs and played for [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] between 1948 and 1954.

==Lancashire==
Oldfield joined the Lancashire staff in 1929, but had to wait until 1935 before he could make his debut. His performance promted [[Neville Cardus]], a cricket journalist, to compare Oldfield's strokeplay to that of [[Johnny Tyldesley]].<ref name="cricinfo">{{citation |url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/18255.html |title=Buddy Oldfield |publisher=Cricinfo.com}} Retrieved on 18&nbsp;December 2008.</ref> Oldfield shared in a 271&nbsp;run partnership with [[Eddie Paynter]] when Paynter scored 322 in five hours in 1937 (the innings is the third highest individual score for Lancashire).<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Lancashire/Records/Firstclass/Batting_Records/Highest_Innings_For.html |title=Most runs in an innings for Lancashire |publisher=Cricket Archive}} Retrieved on 17&nbsp;October 2007.</ref> Oldfield again successfully paired up with Paynter in 1938 when they set a record of 306 for the third wicket; this record stood until 1990 when it was bettered by [[Michael Atherton]] and [[Neil Fairbrother]].<ref name="cricinfo"/>

On 19&nbsp;August 1939, Oldfield made his Test debut, aged 28, against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]]. He made scores of 80 and 19 in what was his only Test match. A few days after the match ended, the Second World War broke out and he did not play first-class cricket until 1948,<ref name="cricinfo"/> and curtailing what could have been a long Test career.<ref name="BBC">{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/sports_talk/stump_bearders/4906060.stm |title=Stump the Bearded Wonder No 120 |date=13&nbsp;April 2006 |publisher=BBC Online}} Retrieved on 18&nbsp;December 2008.</ref> He holds the record for most runs by an England player who has played only one Test.<ref name="cricinfo"/>

==Northamptonshire==
After the war ended and first-class cricket resumed, the 35-year-old Oldfield could not agree terms with Lancashire and left. In later years, he reflected that it had been a mistake to leave Lancashire.<ref name="cricinfo"/> In the 151 first-class matches he played for Lancashire, Oldfield scored 7,002 runs at an average of 35.72 with 12 [[century (cricket)|centuries]].<ref name="team stats">{{citation |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/731/f_Batting_by_Team.html |title=First-class batting and fielding for each team by Buddy Oldfield |publisher=CricketArchive.com}} Retrieved on 18&nbsp;December 2008.</ref>

Oldfield played for two seasons in the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]]<ref name="BBC"/> before joining Northamptonshire for the 1948 season. He enjoyed playing against the team that had spurned him, scoring three centuries against Lancashire. In only his second season with Northamptonshire, Oldfield scored 2,192 runs, a record for the team. Oldfield was never given his [[cap (sport)|cap]] by Lancashire, but was awarded one by Nottinghamshire in 1948 for his productive summer.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/731/731.html |title=Buddy Oldfield |publisher=CricketArchive.com}} Retrieved on 18&nbsp;December 2008.</ref> In 1949/50, Oldfield [[Commonwealth XI cricket team in India in 1949-50|toured India]] with the [[Commonwealth XI cricket team|Commonwealth XI]]. Northamptonshire held a benefit year for Oldfield in 1953 which raised 2,728.<ref name="cricinfo"/>

Despite his regret about leaving Lancashire, he was more successful for Northamptonshire, scoring 9,321 runs at 38.51 in 159 matches.<ref name="team stats"/> After retiring from first class cricket in 1954, Oldfield became an umpire. He umpired between 1954 and 1965<ref name="BBC"/> and stood in two Test matches, one in 1960 and one in 1962. He returned to Old Trafford in 1968 when he became Lancashire's coach, and held the position for five years. He died on 19&nbsp;April 1996.<ref name="cricinfo"/>
