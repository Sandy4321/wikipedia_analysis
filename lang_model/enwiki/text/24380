'''High Stile''' is a [[mountain]] in the western part of the [[Lake District]] in northwest [[England]]. It is the eleventh highest [[Marilyn (hill)|Marilyn]], standing 807&nbsp;metres (2,648&nbsp;ft) high, and has a [[Topographic prominence|relative height]] of 362&nbsp;metres.(1,187&nbsp;ft)

It is the highest in the range of fells extending north west from [[Great Gable]] towards [[Loweswater]], and together with its satellites, [[Red Pike (Buttermere)|Red Pike]] and [[High Crag]], forms a trio of fells overlooking the lake and village of [[Buttermere]]. On this side are high crags, wild combes and a small tarn, [[Bleaberry Tarn]]. High Stile is most easily ascended as part of a traverse of the three fells.

==Topography==
The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and [[Wasdale]] to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are [[Great Gable]] and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of [[Ennerdale]], the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.<ref name="wainwright">[[Alfred Wainwright]]: ''A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells'': Westmorland Gazette (1966): ISBN 0-7112-2460-9</ref> The highest section of the northern branch is formed by the trio of [[Buttermere]] fells, [[High Crag]], High Stile and [[Red Pike (Buttermere)|Red Pike]].

The Buttermere Fells, also known as Buttermere Edge,<ref name="birkett"> Bill Birkett:''Complete Lakeland Fells'': Collins Willow (1994): ISBN 0-00-713629-3</ref> form the watershed between [[Buttermere]] and Upper [[Ennerdale]]. The Ennerdale flanks are steep and rough with areas of crag, the lower slopes being planted with a ribbon of conifers. Across the narrow ridge-top to the north are deep [[Cirque|corrie]]s and dark walls of crag, glowering down over the lake. The ridge continues south east to [[Haystacks (Lake District)|Haystacks]] and the Great Gable group. Beyond Red Pike to the west are [[Starling Dodd]], [[Great Borne]] and the [[Loweswater]] Fells.

All three Buttermere Fells throw out a short spur towards the lake with deep combs hollowed out between them. North west of High Stile is Bleaberry Comb, backed by the wall of Chapel Crags. Nestled deep within is Bleaberry Tarn, a pool which is on continual shadow from November to March. Despite the steep contours of the rock walls above, the tarn is only about 15&nbsp;ft deep, and is well stocked with trout.<ref name="blair"> Blair, Don: ''Exploring Lakeland Tarns'': Lakeland Manor Press (2003): ISBN 0-9543-9041-5 </ref>. Bleaberry Tarn is drained into Buttermere by Sourmilk Gill, reaching the lake mere yards from its outlet. A belt of trees has been planted along the shoreline. Birkness Comb<ref name="wainwright"/><ref name="birkett"/>, also called Burtness Comb on [[Ordnance Survey]] maps, lies between the truncated and unnamed northern ridges of High Crag and High Stile. The lack of a retaining [[morraine]] means that this hollow has no tarn, Comb Beck running uninterrupted to the Lake. Grey Crag and Eagle Crag are the main faces on High Stile. These corries being scooped out of the northern face result in the connecting ridges between the three Buttermere Fells being fine and narrow.

The Ennerdale flanks have a tier of crag at around 2,000&nbsp;ft, The Knors and Raven Crag being the principal features. At the foot of the slopes are the massed conifers of the Ennerdale Forest, all contributing to the difficulty of access. There are no paths on the southern flank of High Stile.

==Geology and Mining==
The summit area is formed of the [[siltstone]], [[sandstone]], conglomerate, [[tuff]], [[lapilli]]-tuff and [[andesite]] sills of the Eagle Crag Member. The northern slopes display the underlying [[olistostrome]] of disrupted, sheared and folded [[mudstone]], [[siltstone]] and [[sandstone]] of the Buttermere Formation. In the direction of Red Pike are intrusions of the granophyric [[granite]].<ref name="BGS">British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, ''England & Wales Sheet 29'': BGS (1999)</ref>

There are the remains of a small [[copper]] mine near the shore of Buttermere. This was worked from 1569 to 1570 and again in the 1820s.<ref name="adams">Adams, John: ''Mines of the Lake District Fells'': Dalesman (1995) ISBN 0-85206-931-6</ref>

==Summit and View==
The highest point lies a little way out onto the northern spur at the top of Grey Crag, marked by a [[cairn]]. The highest point on the main ridge is only 3 feet lower and was regarded as the summit by [[Alfred Wainwright]]<ref name="wainwright"/>, the maps available at the time not deciding the issue. This top has two main cairns side by side. In an attempt to avoid confusion some guidebooks refer to the summit as Grey Crag and the top on the ridge as High Stile.<ref name="birkett"/>.

The view is extensive, the highlight perhaps being the north western fells across the Buttermere valley. [[Ennerdale Water]] and [[Crummock Water]] are in view and careful steps toward the brink can also add Bleaberry Tarn to the picture. Fine views of the crags of the surrounding combs complete the foreground.<ref name="wainwright"/>

==Ascents==
The fell is usually ascended as a traverse of the 'Buttermere Three', as the north eastern flank is very steep and rough. Strong walkers may continue the walk towards [[Haystacks (Lake District)|Haystacks]], four miles to the south east. The direct ascent from [[Ennerdale]] (through [[forest]] and steep [[bracken]]) is not found in guidebooks. The fell is climbed as part of ''Variation&nbsp;1'' on the [[Coast to Coast Walk]].

Direct ascents can be made if desired via either of the northern combs. From the shore of Buttermere a path runs up into Birkness Comb from where the northern spur can be gained. From Buttermere village the path to Bleaberry Tarn can be used, branching off to find a line around the eastern end of Chapel Crags. If climbing from Ennerdale the route up Red Pike may be used.<ref name="wainwright"/><ref name="birkett"/>
