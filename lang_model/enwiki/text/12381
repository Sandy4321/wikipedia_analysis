The '''flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland after World War II''' was part of a series of [[Flight and expulsion of Germans during and after WWII|flights and expulsions of Germans from Europe during and after World War II]].  This article covers the flight and expulsion of Germans from all regions which are currently within the territorial boundaries of Poland although there may have been questions of sovereignty regarding some of them at the time that the expulsions took place.

==Historical context==

For many centuries German settled to various areas of Poland and Lithuania (see [[History of German settlement in Eastern Europe]]), gradually dominating the native Baltic and Slavic populations. Later, [[Kingdom of Prussia]] continued to settle Germans in 18th and 19th centuries into formerly Polish territories, this time in order to displace the [[autochthonous]] Polish population. Overall, hundreds of thousands of Germans were settled in Poland by Prussia and later [[German Reich]] until the [[World War I|First World War]]. Many of the Germans left Poland following the First World War due to [[Weimar Republic|German]] propaganda, but still a portion of citizens of the [[Second Polish Republic]] of German descent remained, particularly in the western areas of the country. In the late 1930s, the 2.5% German minority in Poland openly sympathised with the [[Nazi Germany|German Nazi regime]]. Germany used their presence and the alleged persecution of [[Volksdeutsche]] as propaganda tools in preparation for the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] in 1939 (see also [[History of Poland (1939-1945)]]).
Nazi Germany's [[Generalplan Ost]] strategy for Central and Eastern Europe envisioned the creation of [[Gro<U+00DF>deutschland|Greater Germany]] state, which was to be built by means of removing a variety of non-Germans from Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and other areas in Eastern Europe, mainly [[Slavs]] and [[Jews]] believed by Nazis to be [[Untermensch|subhuman]] and targeted for eventual extermination. Even before the war both Prussia and German Reich had settled hundreds of thousands of Germans into formerly Polish territories to displace Polish population.  Some Germans moving into these areas were placed there as part of the Nazi wartime settlement policies (particularly in Eastern Poland) and had replaced Poles who were removed or killed by the Nazis during their occupation. During the war, Germany deported many millions of Poles either to other territories, to concentration camps or as slave workers ''([[#Reversing German efforts to reshape East European demographics|see below]])''. Many others were deported by the Soviet Union.

==Plans to expel Germans==
Once the [[Allies of World War II]] ratified the planned westward adjustment of the [[People's Republic of Poland|Polish State]] into the eastern provinces of the former [[Deutsches Reich|German Reich]], the principle of compulsory resettlement of [[Germans]], considered to be disloyal minority, had been accepted as well. 

At the [[Tehran Conference]] (Nov.-Dec. 1943) it was decided that, in consideration of Stalin's demand for Polish territory east of the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact|Molotov-Ribbentrop]] line, Poland would be compensated westward. Territorial compensation would be made in conjunction with the plan to transfer German population to new Germany.

Although the [[Polish government in Exile]] was recognised by the Allies at that time, the [[Soviet Union]] broke off all diplomatic relations with it in April 1943. The Polish delegation was not present at the Tehran Conference. On April 20th, 1944,  in Moscow, the Soviet sponsored Polish Communist cell founded the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] ({{lang-pl|Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego, PKWN}}) on Stalin<U+2019>s initiative. Just one week later the representatives of the PKWN and the Soviet Union signed a treaty regulating the new Polish-Soviet border. 

When Stalin and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] made it clear in 1943 that the Soviets would keep the portion of Poland east of the [[Curzon Line]], the Poles were allowed to make claims to [[Danzig]], [[Upper Silesia]], and much of [[East Prussia]] with the intent of transferring Polish citizens from the 40% of the former territory of Poland, now claimed by the Soviets.

Though initially hesitant to support widespread post-war population transfers, the British government began signalling approval already in late 1940, after German bombing attacks on British cities had radicalised British public opinion. But, British officials were sharply divided on the extent and speed of the transfers. In 1943, the [[War Office]] opposed the [[Foreign Office]]<U+2019>s intentions to move Polish borders as far as the [[Oder-Neisse line]] and deport the millions of Germans who would be left inside the new borders of Poland. ''Such a move'', the [[Directorate of Military Intelligence|Director of Military Intelligence]]<!--director's name missing--> wrote, ''would yield an overpopulated and revisionist Germany bordering an underpopulated and weak Poland, and would "sow the seeds of another war"''.<ref>Detlef Brandes. ''"Der Weg zur Vertreibung 1938-1945. Pl<U+00E4>ne und Entscheidungen zum Transfer"'', p.233</ref> 
The Foreign Office countered with the argument that German salients in the East were even more dangerous and rendered Poland strategically vulnerable. Just as important, argued the Foreign Office, Britain had a moral obligation to Poland, which would have to be compensated for its losses to the Soviet Union.

Official government documents in the British [[Public Record Office]] in London and in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|U.S. National Archives]] in Washington amply prove{{Fact|date=April 2007}} that experts<!--who ?--> in the Foreign Office and the [[United States Department of State]] urged limits on territorial compensation to Poland (initially only East Prussia, then ultimately to the [[Oder River]]). They<!--who ?--> also advised limits on the concomitant resettlement of Germans (between 2.5 and 7 million), to be supervised by a so-called Population Transfers Commission, which would guarantee an orderly, step-by-step process and compensation for abandoned property. The diplomats cited the precedent of a population exchange between Greece and Turkey from 1923 to 1926 as justification, an exchange which was conducted under the supervision of the [[League of Nations]] and on the basis of the [[Lausanne Treaty]]. 

At the [[Potsdam Conference]] in July, 1945, Article XIII concerning the transfer of Germans was adopted. It was an emergency measure, drafted and adopted in great haste, a response to the wild expulsions of Germans from Czechoslovakia and Poland, which had created a chaotic situation in the American and British zones of occupation. Article XIII had its primary purpose in a moratorium on expulsions{{Fact|date=April 2007}}, under the jurisdiction of the Allied Control Council in Berlin, which would then determine the extent and time for any future transfers of population.

The populations transports to the British occupation zone in Germany were used to be mercilessly delayed by the British authorities that was cause of many deaths. Nevertheless, the American and British governments repeatedly lodged protests in Warsaw and Prague with regard to the inhuman treatment of the German populations{{Fact|date=April 2007}}, and for non-observance of the guidelines set forth in Article XIII.

===Yalta Conference===
The decision to move Poland's boundary westward was made by Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States at the [[Yalta Conference]], shortly before the end of the war. The precise location of the border was left open but the Allies accepted in general the principle of the [[Oder River]] as the future western border of Poland and of population transfer as the way to prevent future border disputes.

At the [[Yalta Conference]], the Allies agreed to place certain [[Former eastern territories of Germany|territories that had been part of Germany prior to 1937]] under Polish and Soviet administration, with the final borders to be determined in the peace treaty following the war.  Upon gaining control of these lands, the Soviet and Polish-Communist authorities started to expel the German population of the lands newly under their control. <!-- The plan was that, with the German populace expelled, Germany would not be able to make claims to the territories again.--> The land was then populated with Polish citizens who had been expelled from the eastern [[Kresy]] areas, which had newly been annexed by the Soviet Union.

==Controversy over reasons and justifications for the expulsions==
Given the complex history of the region and the divergent interests of the victorious Allied powers, it is difficult to ascribe a definitive set of motivations behind the expulsions.  Various groups, including the public in affected countries and historians, perceive the reasons for the Potsdam decision and subsequent transfers differently. The key issues that motivated the expulsions are discussed below.

===Compensation for territories lost to the Soviet Union===
[[Image:Curzon line en.svg|right|thumb|300px|Poland's old and new borders, 1945]]
Poland lost 43 percent of its pre-war territory due to the fact that the Soviet Union insisted on keeping what it had annexed as a result of the partition of Poland between Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939. While some cities, like [[Gda<U+0144>sk]] (Danzig), were transferred to Poland as part of the "clean sweep" (see below) that eliminated minorities and strategically risky borders, other cities, like [[Wroc<U+0142>aw]] (Breslau) or [[Szczecin]] (Stettin), would hardly have been transferred to Poland had it not lost [[Vilnius]] (Wilno), [[Hrodna]] (Grodno) and [[Lviv]] (Lw<U+00F3>w).

Thus, from the perspective of the Polish, Communist and Western Allies, one justification for the expulsion of the Germans was compensation of Poland for territories taken by the Soviet Union.

===A desire to create ethnically homogeneous nation states===
[[Image:Nationalities in Second Polish Republic ca. 1931.png|thumb|300px|Dominating nationalities in Poland around 1931.]]

In 1944 in a debate in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on [[15 December]] 1944 [[Winston Churchill]] said

This was presented as the key reason for the official decisions of the Potsdam conference and previous allied conferences involving the Polish and Czech exile governments, as cited in this article.

There is a longer history of the Polish nation trying to assert themselves against German eastward expansionism (see also [[Drang nach Osten]]), as well as the late compensatory nationalism of newly independent Eastern-European nation states{{Fact|date=January 2008}}. The border on [[Oder-Neisse line]] was actively pursued by the [[Polish government in Exile]], which, under the pressure from the Soviet Union and its western allies, was looking for possible compensation for the Soviet-occupied eastern regions which [[Stalin]] was not willing to give back. [http://www.wsgn.euv-frankfurt-o.de/vc/pageO9.html]

=== Distrust of and enmity towards German communities in Poland ===

There was an expressed fear of disloyalty of Germans in Silesia and Pomerania based in part on the pro-Nazi activities of members of the German ethnic group during the war and even after the end of the war. As a result of these activities, there was not a political party that would agree with Germans continuing to live in Silesia and Pomerania. To Poles, deportation of Germans was seen as an effort to avoid such events in the future and as a result Polish authorities proposed population transfer of Germans already in the late 1941.<ref name="Wardzy<U+0144>ska">''"Polacy - wysiedleni, wyp<U+0119>dzeni i wyrugowani przez III Rzesz<U+0119>"'', Maria Wardzy<U+0144>ska, Warsaw 2004". Created on order of Reichsf<U+00FC>hrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, the organization called [[Selbstschutz]] cooperated in executions during <U+201E>Intelligenzaktion<U+201D>, made alongside operational groups of security policy, by identifying local Poles and interning them</ref>

===Preventing ethnic violence===

Transferring the German-speaking population to the west was advocated as a necessary means of achieving inter-ethnic peace. (Also opinion of US president Roosevelt.{{Fact|date=June 2007}})

The participants at the Potsdam Conference{{Fact|date=June 2007}} asserted the expulsions were the only way to prevent ethnic violence. As [[Winston Churchill]] expounded in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in 1944, ''"Expulsion is the method which, in so far as we have been able to see, will be the most satisfactory and lasting. There will be no mixture of populations to cause endless trouble. <U+2026> A clean sweep will be made. I am not alarmed by these transferences, which are more possible in modern conditions<U+2026>"''. From this point of view the policy achieved its goals: the 1945 borders are stable and ethnic conflicts are relatively marginal.

===Retribution===

One justification offered for the expulsions is that the actual purpose of the policy was to punish the Germans for [[Germany]]'s actions during World War II, including its expulsion of [[Poles]] from territories annexed to [[Nazi Germany]]; and at the same time to create ethnically homogeneous [[nation state]]s that would not give rise to the kind of ethnic tensions that had preceded the war.

Also, there was little empathy for German victims after the World War II experience, especially since the German government had itself ethnically cleansed a large number of areas (e.g. [[Reichsgau Wartheland]]) during the war.

===Invalidating German territorial claims===

According to one argument, the purpose of expelling Germans from areas now belonging to other countries was to invalidate German territorial claims to the land. The purported objective was to prevent a repetition of what happened in the [[Sudetenland]] where the Nazis based territorial claims based upon the large number of [[ethnic German]]s living there.

===Making room for Polish returnees===

According to this line of reasoning, Germans were expelled to make housing available for Poles returning to Poland from western Poland, Germany and the USSR.  Long before former German territories were captured by the Red Army, hundreds of thousands of Poles were sent to [[Siberia]] and [[gulag]] camps in remote parts of the USSR in four major waves of deportations following the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasion of Poland]]. 

Around 2 million Poles from eastern Poland (behind the [[Curzon line]]) were expelled by the Soviets to western Poland.  

In addition, an estimated 800,000 people from [[Warsaw]] and an unknown number of Poles from other cities were deported by the Germans to special work camps in Germany.  After the end of the war, most of these people returned to Poland and needed housing and source of income in a country devastated by war, where housing stock especially in towns was destroyed on a scale unknown in Western countries (e.g. Warsaw).

Ethnic Poles came from France, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina (eg. Prnjavor), Romania.

===Making the future Polish state dependent on the Soviet Union===

Never stated as the official reason, some believe that one of the Soviet motivations for the expulsions was to make the Polish state more dependent on the Soviet Union protection against potential future German demands.

===Compensation for Polish property left behind by the expellees===

It has been alleged that the Polish Communist authorities often purposefully did not inform the Germans intended for deportation about their scheduled transport time until 24 hours before the departure.  The alleged rationale for this was to make it more difficult for the Germans to organize the transport of their property.<ref name="Jankowiak">Jankowiak, p. 135</ref>

===Reversing German efforts to reshape East European demographics===
{{see|Generalplan Ost}}

During the German occupation of Poland, between 1.6 and 2 million Polish people [http://www.ushmm.org/education/resource/poles/poles.php] were expelled from their homes. This number does not include millions<ref name="Poles"> [http://www.ushmm.org/education/resource/poles/poles.php?menu=/export/home/www/doc_root/education/foreducators/include/menu.txt&bgcolor=CD9544 "Poles: Victims of the Nazi Era"]</ref> of slave workers or people arrested by the Germans and sent to Nazi concentration camps ([[World War II evacuation and expulsion#Deportation of Poles|see "Deportation of Poles"]]).

By the end of 1940 [http://www.ushmm.org/education/resource/poles/poles.php], the German authorities had expelled approximately 325,000 Poles without warning<ref>[http://www.ushmm.org/education/resource/poles/poles.php "Poles: Victims of the Nazi Era" at Holocaust Memorial Museum]</ref>. Their property was either confiscated by the authorities, sent to Germany or given to German settlers. Many elderly people and children died in makeshift transit camps. In 1941, the Germans expelled 45,000 more people after the invasion of the Soviet Union. The resettlement of Poles of all denominations continued, mostly in Silesia, from where 19,000 people were deported in October of 1940. 

In many instances, Poles were given between 15 minutes and 1 hour to collect their personal belongings (usually no more than 15 kilograms per person) before they were thrown out of their homes and transported east ([[World War II evacuation and expulsion#Deportation of Poles|see "Deportation of Poles"]]). On top of that about 3 million Poles were deported to Germany for [[forced labor]] in German factories<ref name="Rosz">Wojciech Roszkowski, Historia Polski 1914<U+2013>1997, Warsaw 1998</ref>  and 5 million in [[German concentration camps]].{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Further 6 million Polish citizens were killed during the war.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} All these actions resulted in significant changes in demographics at the end of the war.

==Chronology of the flight and expulsions==

The first mass movement of German civilians in the [[Former eastern territories of Germany|eastern territories]] was composed of both spontaneous "flight" and organized "evacuation" starting in the summer of 1944 and continuing through spring of 1945.  Several million people were involved in this movement was driven by fear of the advancing Soviet army.  Of these, several hundred thousand died of cold or hunger or in Allied bombardment, though hundreds of thousands of others soon made their way back to the area.<ref>Bjork, James.    http://www.h-net.msu.edu/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=263131117051503</ref>

The term "wild expulsion" ({{lang-de|wilde Vertreibung}}) applies to  poorly organized expulsions conducted by the Polish Communist military and civilian authorities in summer 1945, before the population transfers were officially sanctioned by the Allies at the Potsdam conference. These actions were superseded in spring 1946 by a series of larger, better organized, and less lethal "forced resettlements" which continued through 1947. A final major wave of resettlement resumed in 1948 and 1949. 

===Flight and evacuation from the advance of the Red Army===
In the first months of 1945, as the [[Red Army]] advanced through the countries of Eastern Europe and the provinces of Eastern Germany.  Six million Germans fled as the Soviet Red Army advanced from the East in 1944 and 1945. During this mad and chaotic flight to escape the approaching battlefront, 450,000 Germans fled East Prussia over the perilous ice of the Frische Haff; hundreds of thousands more were evacuated by ship from Danzig and other port cities.<ref>[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=260621074909720 H-Net Review: Eagle Glassheim <eglasshe@princeton.edu> on Vertreibung und Aussiedlung der deutschen Bev<U+00C3><U+0192><U+00C2><U+00B6>lkerung aus Polen 1945 bis 1949<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The German authorities planned to evacuate all Germans from Poland.  However, in reality, evacuation was not feasible in some areas due to battlefield conditions near the front line.

Soviet troops, as well as native populations and local militias exacted revenge on ethnic Germans and German nationals. While many Germans had already fled ahead of the advancing Soviet Army, millions of Reichs- and Volksdeutsche remained in East and West Prussia, Silesia, Pomerania, the Sudetenland, and in pockets throughout Central and Eastern Europe.

===Deportation to the Soviet Union===
{{main|Forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union}}

On February 6, 1945, Soviet [[NKVD]] ordered [[mobilisation]] of all German men (17 to 50 years old) in the Soviet-controlled territories. Many of them were then transported to Soviet Union for [[forced labour]]. In the former German territories the Soviet authorities did not always distinguish between the Poles and Germans and often treated them alike.<ref>Jankowiak, p. 35</ref>

===Pre-Potsdam "wild" deportations (May - July 1945)===

In 1945, the former German [[Silesia]]n, [[Pomerania]]n and [[East-Prussia]]n territories were [[Military occupation|occupied]] by Soviet and Communist-led Polish military forces. Early expulsions in Poland were undertaken by the Polish communist military authorities already before the Potsdam Conference. To ensure their incorporation to Poland, the Polish communists ordered that Germans were to be [[expelled]]. "We must expel all the Germans because countries are build on national lines and not on multi-national once." a cite from Plenum of Central Committee of the Polish Workers Party, May 20-21, 1945.<ref>Naimark, Russian in Germany. p. 75 reference 31</ref> Germans were defined as either ''Reichsdeutsche'', people enlisted in 1st or 2nd ''Volksliste'' groups, and those of the 3rd group, who held German citizenship.

During a period of "wild expulsions" from May to July 1945, the Polish military drove up to 400,000 Germans across Poland's new western border. Though apparently inspired by a similar expulsion frenzy in Czechoslovakia, Poles were neither as brutal nor as thorough as their Czech counterparts.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} 

The early phase of expulsion was often particularly brutal. Polish soldiers, stated one report, "relate to German women as to free booty".<ref>Naimark, Russian in Germany. p. 76 reference 34</ref> Historians disagree as to the number of Germans deported during this phase of expulsion. The estimates range from 300 thousand to 500 thousand people.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Many Germans evacuated during the war weren't allowed to return to their homes.

===Transfer of territories to Poland===

The [[Soviet Union]] transferred territories to the east of the [[Oder-Neisse Line]] to Poland in July 1945. These territories included the today's city of [[Szczecin]] (former German ''Stettin'') with the exception of the harbor which the Soviet authorities dismantled and removed to Soviet Union until October 1948. After July 1945, most Germans were expelled to the territories west of the Oder-Neisse Line. Stettin was crowded with German expellees already before the transfer, who were then forced to leave to other parts of Germany.

"The president (Truman) complained that there were now five occupation zones because the Soviets had turned over the area extending along the Oder and western Neisse to the Poles. This was in violation of the Yalta agreement. The president did not see how economic controls or reparations could operate if Germany was thus broken up."<ref>James L. Gormly: From Potsdam to the COLD WAR. Big Three Diplomacy 1945-1947. Scholarly Resources Inc. Delaware, 1990 (ISBN 0-8420-2334-8) p. 49)</ref>

"Churchill spoke strongly against giving the Poles control over an area in which some eight million Germans lived. Stalin insisted that the Germans had all fled and that the Poles were needed to fill the vacuum."<ref>James L. Gormly: From Potsdam to the COLD WAR. Big Three Diplomacy 1945-1947. Scholarly Resources Inc. Delaware, 1990 (ISBN 0-8420-2334-8) (p. 50)</ref>

"On July 24 the Polish delegation arrived in Berlin, headed by Prime Minister Boleslaw Bierut and including Mikolajczyk and Foreign Minister Wincenty Rzymowksi. They consistently held to the position that the Oder and western Neisse rivers should be the frontier, and they vehemently argued their case before the foreign ministers, Churchill, and Truman, in turn."<ref>James L. Gormly: From Potsdam to the COLD WAR. Big Three Diplomacy 1945-1947. Scholarly Resources Inc. Delaware, 1990 (ISBN 0-8420-2334-8) (p. 50)</ref>

The next day Churchill said to Stalin:

"The Poles are driving the Germans out of the Russian zone. That should not be done without considering its effect on the food supply and reparations. We are getting into a position where the Poles have food and coal, and we have the mass of (the) population thrown at us."<ref>James L. Gormly: From Potsdam to the COLD WAR.

"To the Soviets, reparations were more important than boundaries, and Stalin might have sold out the Poles if they had not so vociferously protested when, in spite of his 'illness', he consulted with them during the evening of July 29."<ref>James L. Gormly: From Potsdam to the COLD WAR. Big Three Diplomacy 1945-1947. Scholarly Resources Inc. Delaware, 1990 (ISBN 0-8420-2334-8) (p.55f)</ref>

===Post-Potsdam Transfers===

The second wave of expulsions came after the Potsdam conference, but before the "organized transfer" of remaining Germans began in early 1946.  Despite the fact that article 8 of Potsdam agreement from August 2, 1945 stated that "population transfer" should be performed in ordered an humane manner, and should not commence until after the creation of an expulsion plan approved by the Allied Control Council, the expulsions continued without rules and were associated with many criminal acts.<ref> Meyers Lexicon Online. [http://lexikon.meyers.de/meyers/Vertreibung Vertreibung].  Translated from German.</ref>

From August to December, 1945, Polish authorities expelled close to 600,000 more Germans in poorly organized transports. There were many cases where evacuated Germans starved and froze to death in slow and ill-equipped trains, often waiting weeks for approval to enter British occupation zone.  Estimates of deaths during this phase ran in the thousands.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

The final phase involved the transfer of 2.25 million Germans in a process coordinated with British and Soviet authorities in occupied Germany in 1946 and 1947. Due to better conditions than those in 1945, there were fewer cases of death during the transport.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

====Szczecin====
In [[Szczecin]] (Stettin), Polish officials faced great dilemmas, difficulties, and dangers in expelling Germans. Both areas saw tense conflicts between competing administrative authorities. The worst of these tensions involved Soviet and Polish authorities in and around Szczecin. There, the Soviets even occupied the Szczecin harbor until October, 1948. As far as the Poles were concerned, the Soviets protected Germans so as to exploit their labor; in the harbor area, for example, the Soviets sanctioned German schools for the children of German workers. The Poles thus blamed the Soviets for many of the region's ills, including the continued presence of Germans in the province. 

But conflicts between Soviets and Poles were not the only administrative tensions that arose during the expulsions. In Szczecin, civilian authorities were frustrated with the Polish military's inability to guard the German-Polish border. They were also angered that the military undertook a wave of expulsions without informing them in the summer of 1945. At that time, local authorities needed the German work force to maintain a smooth-functioning economy and, most importantly, to ensure a steady stream of cheap agricultural labor. Polish employers were particularly bent on retaining the German work force--to benefit not only from German professional expertise, but also from a labor pool that was forced to work for little or no wages. Central authorities, however, initially wanted to get rid of Germans as quickly as possible. 

Beginning in 1946, however, they changed their posture and often forced local authorities to hold back on deportations (even when these were ready to expel Germans) so that the expulsions could be carried out in the humanitarian manner demanded by the Allies. In fact, Polish authorities had little inclination to treat Germans decently during expulsions.  However, many officials were concerned with Poland's international image and how the deportation story would fare in the international press. 

Provincial authorities were particularly frustrated by their inability to control the actual process of expulsion. To their dismay, local officials not only did not prevent, but actually condoned and even engaged in plunder and corruption at every step of the deportations. Indeed, of all the complaints voiced by regional authorities, none were more persistent than those concerning the ongoing plunder of German valuables. All too often, these officials complained, German property ended up in private and not state hands. Provincial officials also believed that local authorities were hiding Germans so as to benefit from a low-cost labor force. 

In addition, they were sorely disappointed by the organization of the deportations. Temporary camps that were set up to process the deportees had atrocious hygiene conditions; epidemic and other illnesses were common and, not infrequently, led to death. The sick, old, and pregnant were supposed to be treated with more care; in fact, they were often subject to the same coarse brutality as healthier Germans. Trains that were to bring the deportees to Germany were generally late or never came at all; the deportation process that was supposed to last just a few days sometimes went on for weeks or even months.<ref>[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=39261148316906 H-Net Review: Catherine Epstein on "Unsere Heimat ist uns ein fremdes Land geworden ..."

===Germanised Poles===
Another problem that Polish authorities were faced with was the disposition of the so-called "Germanized Poles", many of whom were referred to as "[[autochthon]]s." More than a million residents of [[Masuria]] and [[Upper Silesia]] were of Slavic descent, but did not identify with Polish nationality. Many spoke German or Germanized dialects of Polish, and large numbers had registered with the German [[Deutsche Volksliste]] during the war. Wanting to retain as many Poles as possible, the government put autochthons through a "verification" process to determine which were redeemable as Poland citizens. Autochthons not only disliked the subjective and often arbitrary verification process, but they also faced discrimination even once verified. Polish settlers coveted autochthon property, and they resented and distrusted the verified autochthons. Many autochthons fled to occupied Germany in despair at their treatment, although the situation in Germany was little better. As one Silesian wrote, "In Poland, I'm a German. In Germany, a Pole. Perhaps they should create a state for us on the moon. There we might finally feel at home"<ref>Bernadetta Nitschke.

===Communist internment camps in Poland===
As early as November 4, 1944, Poland started collecting Polish citizens who had registered for the [[Deutsche Volksliste]] into transit camps from where they would be sent to Germany.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} On November 4, 1944, a decree mandated that all Germans be interned in internment camps. The decrees further stated that all Volksdeutsche were to be considered ''prima facie'' traitors without the need for evidentiary proof.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

Whereas many of the Germans who remained were randomly rounded up and expelled, thousands ended up in internment facilities like [[Zgoda labour camp]]. Others performed labor on farms, or were deported to distant parts of the Soviet Union, where they worked in labor camps in order to repair damage caused to those countries by German aggression. <ref>http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=198721097755610 Amy Alrich.

In Communist Poland, many camps and other types of facilities were adapted for the purposes of housing Germans before their transfer into Germany. The Polish authorities gradually centralized the interned Germans into six main facilities: [[Glaz]], [[Milecin]], [[Potulice]], [[Gronowo]], [[Jaworzno]], and [[Sikawa]].  Eventually, [[Central Labour Camp Potulice]] (a former [[Nazi concentration camp]]) became the central administrative camp for housing interned Germans. In total, over 30 thousand Germans were inmates of the camp.

By 1950, most of these Germans were brought to processing facilities near the German-Polish border, where authorities determined their final destination within the new German states.<ref>http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=198721097755610</ref>

In [[1948]] the policy regarding Volksdeutsche had changed. They were subjected to investigation of any transgressions committed during WW2 and in many cases pardoned.

Alfred de Zayas claims that ''in many internment camps no relief from outside was permitted. In some camps relatives would bring packages and deliver them to the Polish guards, who regularly plundered the contents and delivered only the rest, if that much. Frequently these relatives were so illtreated that they never returned. Internees who came to claim their packages were also mistreated by the guards, who insisted the internees should speak Polish, even if they were Germans born in German-speaking Silesia or Pomerania.''<ref>Alfred M. de Zayas, Nemesis at Potsdam, Routledge & Kegan Paul, London 1977 ISBN 0710084684 pp. 124ff.</ref>

As a matter of fact, the opposite was true. Poles despised "Germans" speaking Polish, who were treated as traitors. "Real" Germans were regarded with much more tolerance.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

In [[1950]], a general amnesty was declared for Germans still residing in Poland. From now on, only people who were charged with the commission of specific crimes were denied Polish citizenship.  All others were not only allowed, but even forced, to stay in Poland. However, due to tense atmosphere of [[Cold war]] aroused during [[Korean war]], growth of the Stalinist terror in the country, many ethnic Poles were then dreaming of leaving country. Soon some of them will resort to search for German forefathers in order to be allowed to leave.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

===Repopulation of vacated lands===

People from all over Poland quickly moved in to fill the void left by the expulsion of the German population. Some of these new arrivals were ethnic Poles, and some ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusians residing in the east of Poland. Large numbers of Ukrainians were also forced to move from south eastern Poland under a 1947 Polish government operation, which aimed at dispersing, and therefore assimilating, the Ukrainian population, which had not moved east, throughout the newly acquired territories. Belarusians living around the area around Bia<U+0142>ystok were also pressured into relocating to the areas vacated by fleeing German population for the same reasons. This scattering of members of non-Polish ethnic groups throughout the country was an attempt to dissolve the unique ethnic identity of groups like the Ukrainians, Belarusians and Lemkos, and broke the proximity and communication necessary for strong communities to form. Such policy implemented Soviet ideas, not Polish nationalistic ones.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

Many Poles made the decision to relocate as they preferred to live in Poland rather than in what was now part of the Soviet Union. Others were encouraged to relocate to the west - "the land of opportunity" - by Polish and Soviet newspapers and officials. These new territories were described as a place where opulent villas abandoned by fleeing Germans waited for the brave; fully furnished houses and businesses were available for the taking. These were the just rewards for the hardships and bitter losses of the war. The papers urged, "Go! Tomorrow might be too late". According to some Polish sources Lithuanian authorities expelled educated Poles and hoped to Lithuanize uneducated ones.

Thousands of Jews settled in Lower Silesia creating Jewish cooperatives and institutions.

Poles massively returned from vacated lands because of high criminality, for which mostly Soviet soldiers were responsible.

==Casualties==
Though estimates of the dead range widely, from 40 thousand to as many as a million Germans perished during flight and expulsion from Poland in 1944-45.<ref>[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=260621074909720 H-Net Review: Eagle Glassheim <eglasshe@princeton.edu> on Vertreibung und Aussiedlung der deutschen Bev<U+00C3><U+0192><U+00C2><U+00B6>lkerung aus Polen 1945 bis 1949<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Of around 12.4 million Germans residing within the lands of post-war Poland in 1944, 3.6 million were expelled, one million were certified as Poles, 300,000 remained in Poland as a German minority, and up to 1.1 million are unaccounted for and presumed to be dead.  <ref>Bernadetta Nitschke.

==Legacy==
In the first years after the war, a very small minority opinion criticized the expulsion of Germans as inhumane.  One such voice was [[Stanislaw Adamski]], the bishop of Katowice.

From the late 1950s onwards, the blatant exploitation of the "German Question" by the Communist regime and the position that it took with respect to the expulsions was increasingly criticized by the opposition movement, which strove for better relations with their German neighbours. 

In 1965, a group of Polish bishops made a particularly important overture by sending a letter to their German counterparts in which they asked forgiveness for the wrongs perpetrated during the expulsion and at the same time offered forgiveness for German war crimes.  With this letter, the bishops set an example in a truly pathbreaking way, to which the Polish population, however, at the time largely reacted with a lack of understanding. 

This was understandable since the negative image of Germany was rooted deeply in the Polish psyche due to centuries of oppression aimed at destroying Polish nation, going as far as describing Poles as animals for extermination.  Thus, the attempts made by Znak, a group of Catholic members of parliament, and the opposition Clubs of Catholic Intelligentsia (Kluby Inteligencji Katolickiej, KIK) to attain a somewhat less ideologized picture of the Germans were all the more remarkable. This new perspective also meant dealing critically with the question of how the expulsion of Germans was to be incorporated into the self-image of Polish society.<ref>Kraft, Claudia. Debates on the Expulsion of Germans in Poland since 1945. </ref>

===The Debate in the Public and in Politics since 1989===

Since the beginning of the 1990s, there has been a lively debate in Poland regarding the role of the expulsion of the Germans.  For the first time, Polish responsibility for the expulsions in general and their implementation in particular has also been made an issue. After the signing of the German-Polish treaty on borders and neighbourly relations as well as the visible congruence of Germany's and Poland's interests in a Europe which was reuniting in the first half of the 1990s, it was not only Poland's political and intellectual elites who dealt with the issue of Polish responsibility, but also larger parts of the general public.  

In regions from which the Germans had been expelled, Polish citizens began looking for traces of German cultural heritage and German traditions (as, for instance, a German-Polish network set up in the border regions). 

Only when shifts in German remembrance culture became evident at the turn of the millennium, which gave rise to Polish fears that the importance attached to World War II and the related Polish suffering might decrease, did the pendulum of public opinion swing in the opposite direction, at least in parts of the Polish public and the Polish elites.  In Germany, the  Polish reactions were severely criticized.<ref>Kraft, Claudia. Debates on the Expulsion of Germans in Poland since 1945. http://library.fes.de/library/netzquelle/zwangsmigration/en-46pl.html#qu4</ref>

===Changes in the Polish legal environment===
Niels Redecker argues that Poland's legal environment has changed since 1990 and describes opportunities that expellees and their descendants may pursue.  He notes, for example, that despite a widespread belief that land ownership by foreigners is still effectively banned in Poland, there are in fact no longer major obstacles to the acquisition of real estate by non-citizens. So  expellees and their descendants can already return to their former homeland in Poland if they so wished. 

Redecker also expresses optimism about pursuing property restitution claims in Polish courts. Although the Polish courts continue to uphold the validity of the laws governing expropriation, they have shown a willingness to overturn individual expropriations that did not fully conform to the intent and the provisions of those laws. One group of cases that would certainly seem to fall into this category involves German Jewish claimants whose property had been confiscated by the Nazi regime in the 1930s and then nationalized by Poland after the war. While judgments on these cases have so far been mixed, Redecker argues that such claims are likely to make headway, especially in the context of Poland's entry into the [[European Union]]. This could, he suggests, serve as a wedge opening up the way for broader challenges to the expulsion laws and successful restitution claims by non-Jews. Redecker is careful to note that because German expellees, aware that full restitution or compensation from the Polish state is unrealistic, would "be satisfied with symbolic compensation". <ref>von Redecker, Niels.

==Historiography==
{{weasel}}
For many years, there were strict limitations on dealing with the expulsion of Germans in a scientific manner in the People's Republic of Poland. It was considered the inevitable consequence of the German extermination policy of Poles in Eastern and Central Europe and the territorial reorganization following World War II. 

Since the 1960s, the integration and settlement of the new Polish territories was intensively studied. This meant that the "forced resettlement" or "transfer" of the Germans was also studied - but only as a precondition for the successful integration of these territories, without questioning the responsibility of the Poles involved or asking about the impact of these events on the country's political culture. 

In addition, historians fell back on traditions found earlier in Polish historiography, traditions according to which the [[Former eastern territories of Germany|former Occupied Eastern Territories]] ({{lang-de|Ostgebiete}}) were considered as originally Polish territories due to fact that they belonged to Polish state originally before becoming Germanised. The disappearance of the Germans from Poland thus was regarded as a more or less logical consequence of historic developments.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}
Other historians strongly opposed this point of view.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} They uphold the opinion that although the ancient Germanic territories were under Polish rule for a short time they had been Germanic before. They refer to [[Tacitus]], [[Cesar]] and other [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historians.

Only once historiography was no longer subject to political limitations after the political turnaround of 1989 was it possible to use a more comprehensive approach when dealing with the complex of theme that was "expulsion". Sometimes in co-operation with their German colleagues, Polish historians seized the opportunity of more liberal access to the archives to reconstruct the sequence of events during the expulsions and the activities of the decision-makers and players involved. The topic of expulsion was considered one of the "blank spots" which had been caused by the restrictions that the science of history had been subjected to during the existence of the People's Republic of Poland and which Polish historians now began to reappraise with great vigour. In the meantime, comprehensive monographs and source collections have been created for almost all regions from which Germans were expelled after World War II. Besides the expulsion of Germans, the expulsion of Poles from the former Polish Eastern territories and expulsions within Poland, which mostly affected the Ukrainian part of the population, were focused on.
