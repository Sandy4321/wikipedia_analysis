==History==
Ziva Gilad, a [[spa]] technician, came up with the idea of marketing [[Dead Sea]] mud after watching women tourists scooping up the mud to take home.<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://money.cnn.com/2009/12/09/smallbusiness/ahava_dead_sea.fsb/index.htm Ahava turns Dead Sea Mud into Money]</ref> Ahava was founded in 1988 as a single stand selling bottles of body scrub to tourists, generating $1 million that year.<ref>Export Now: Five Keys to Entering New Markets, By Frank Lavin, Peter Cohan.</ref>

Ahava's shareholders include Hamashbir Holdings, Gaon Holdings, [[Ein Gedi (kibbutz)|Kibbutz Ein Gedi]], [[Mitzpe Shalem|Kibbutz Mitzpe Shalem]] and [[Kalya|Kibbutz Kalya]].
[[Mitzpe Shalem|Kibbutz Mitzpe Shalem]] and [[Kalya|Kibbutz Kalya]] are located north of the Green Line, in the West Bank.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://maps.google.com.au/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Mitzpe+Shalem+Israel&aq=&sll=31.633506,35.425415&sspn=0.665296,1.359558&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Mitspe+Shalem,+Israel&ll=31.644029,35.403442&spn=0.66522,1.359558&z=10 |title= Mitzepe Shalem&nbsp;<U+2013> Google Maps |publisher=[[Google Maps]] |date=2011-08-07 |accessdate=2011-05-01}}</ref>

In 2009 Ahava took on new shareholder [[Shamrock Holdings]], the [[Walt Disney]] Family's investment arm, which purchased 20% of Ahava Dead Sea Laboratories from its existing shareholders<ref>{{cite news|last=Neuman |first=Efrat |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/820165.html |title=Will the British buy love from the Dead Sea? | newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date= |accessdate=2011-02-19}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/819910.html From Israel with Ahava, [[Haaretz]]]</ref> The company has 200 employees, 180 of them in Israel.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

In 2009, the company reported sales of nearly $150 million a year. In the United States, the largest overseas market for Ahava products, the company signed distribution deals with [[Lord & Taylor]], [[Nordstrom]] and the beauty-supply chain [[Ulta]].<ref name=autogenerated3 />

Ahava is the only cosmetics company licensed by the Israeli government to mine raw materials at the Dead Sea.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> On the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea, there are approximately fifty small companies producing cosmetics, but only 15 have a global presence. Israel has imported raw materials for its Dead Sea mud cosmetics from Jordan since 1994.<ref name="jordan">{{cite news|url= http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/bizfocus/archives/2010/03/21/2003468511 |title= Jordan eyeing big share of Dead Sea cosmetics market

Dead Sea mud, alone or in combination with other ingredients, is believed to have benefits for deep cleansing and stimulation of the skin. Minerals extracted from Dead Sea water such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, are said to improve the metabolism, stimulate circulation and aid in the natural repair of cells.<ref name="Mineral_Magic">{{cite news|url= http://www.cosmeticsbusiness.com/technical/article_page/Israel_-_Mineral_Magic/49839 |title= Israel&nbsp;<U+2014> Mineral Magic |publisher=HPCi Media Limited |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2011-05-01}}</ref>  In 2009, Ahava Dermud range of skincare products has been shown to have protective, [[anti-oxidant]] and [[anti-inflammatory]] properties that can antagonize biological effects of [[UVB radiation]] on skin, reducing skin photodamage and photoaging, and reducing oxidative stress and [[inflammation]] in skin pathologies.<ref>Portugal-Cohen, M., Soroka, Y., Ma<U+2019>or, Z., Oron, M., Zioni, T., Br<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>g<U+00E8>re, F.

Therapy with mud packs for conditions such as osteoarthritis is relatively expensive and requires the assistance of a therapist and a treatment room. In the wake of these limitations, Ahava developed mud compresses used in the home which are heated in a microwave
oven or a pot of hot water and placed over painful joints. A clinical research by the [[Ben Gurion University of the Negev]], supported in part by a grant from "Ahava", has concluded that the group treated with natural mud compresses had a reduction of 20% or more in Knee [[Osteoarthritis]] pain scores at treatment completion, at one month, and at three months, compared to the control group.<ref>[http://fohs.bgu.ac.il/homes/shlomi/articles/mud_kneeOA_JClinRHeum.pdf Therapy With Mud Compresses for Knee Osteoarthritis: Comparison of Natural Mud Preparations With Mineral-Depleted Mud].

Embracing the trend toward more natural ingredients in cosmetics, Ahava purifies its own water and, according to the company, employs minimally invasive techniques to harvest mud and minerals. Ingredients are not tested on animals and Ahava products are packaged in recyclable containers.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

==Scientific research==
Ahava is one of several Israeli cosmetics companies researching [[nanotechnology]] applications. The company has established an R&D program to research [[nanoemulsion]] and nanosuspension with mud [[nanoparticles]].<ref name="Mineral_Magic" />

Ahava operates its own laboratory for cell and organ culture. It is the coordinator of SkinTreat (FP-7) and a partner in nanoReTox (FP-7) founded by Cellage, a European research consortium the specializes in skin cellular Ageing (FP-5).<ref name="Nanother">[http://www.nanother.eu/index.php?id=160 Nanother: Ahava]</ref> Ahava developed a laboratory model for in-vitro NP screening that is employed for studying inflammatory processes using UV- irradiated human skin organ cultures.<ref name="Nanother"/>

==Controversy==
The company buys mud, an essential raw material for its products, from the [[Dead Sea Works]], a company found entirely within the internationally recognized borders of Israel, within the green line. However, Ahava's factory is located in the West Bank, an area whose exact status has been disputed for many years, therefore triggering global protests.<ref>http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/west-bank-palestinians-see-an-israeli-roadblock-to-economic-independence-1.420361  accessdate=March 31, 2012</ref> 
According to human rights organization [[B'Tselem]], several Israeli commercial ventures in the West Bank, including Ahava, breach the Hague Convention on the Law and Customs of War on Land, which prohibits exploitation of resources in occupied territory.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.btselem.org/sites/default/files/201105_dispossession_and_exploitation_eng.pdf | title=Dispossession and Exploitation: Israel's Policy in the Jordan Valley & Northern Dead Sea | date= May 2011 | publisher=[[B'Tselem]]}}</ref>

[[File:CodePink-BeautyProductProtest-July2009.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Code Pink]] staging a protest against Ahava in [[Los Angeles]] in 2009]]

Boycott campaigns have been organized by organizations such as [[Code Pink]], which says that Ahava's products come from "stolen Palestinian natural resources in the occupied territory of the Palestinian West Bank", and are produced in Mitzpe Shalem.<ref name=CODEPINK>{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3754920,00.html |title=Code Pink protest calls for Ahava boycott | publisher=[[Ynet News]] | date= July 30, 2009 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}</ref> In response, the company stated that the Mitzpe Shalem kibbutz, where the products are produced, is not an illegal settlement, and that the mud and materials used in Ahava cosmetics products are mined in the Israeli part of the Dead Sea.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=182493 | title=Pro-Israel shoppers defy Ahava products boycott call | date= July 25, 2010 | newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}</ref>

In September, 2011, [[South Africa]]n Industry Minister Rob Davies agreed in principle that goods manufactured in the occupied territories should not be labelled as a product of Israel since that is misleading. Davies said: "We're persuaded it's in the interest of South African consumers to know whether their products are coming from Israel or from the occupied territories." <ref name=SAFRICA>[http://mg.co.za/article/2011-09-16-move-to-relabel-israeli-goods-as-bads Move to relabel 'Israeli' goods as bads ]</ref> The new South African rules will ensure that such products, such as Ahava, are labeled "product of illegal settlement in the Occupied Palestinian Territories" before they can be sold in South Africa.<ref>[http://www.myshtetl.co.za/community/israel/israelnews/product-illegal-settlement-occupied-palestinian-territories Product of illegal settlement in the Occupied Palestinian Territories]</ref>

Prior to this, South African activists had submitted an affidavit to the South African Police Service accusing retailer, Wellness Warehouse, and local Ahava importer, SDV Pharmaceuticals, of violating South African trade law by selling Ahava products carrying false labels of origin.<ref>[http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=128271 Lobbyists challenge <U+2018>made in Israel<U+2019> moniker]</ref>

In May 2012, South Africa<U+2019>s Minister of Trade and Industry announced new labeling rules for Israeli settlement goods;<ref name=SAFRICA2>[http://world.time.com/2012/05/25/why-south-africas-decision-to-rebrand-some-israeli-imports-packs-a-punch/ Why South Africa<U+2019>s Decision to Rebrand Some Israeli Imports Packs a Punch (Time, May 25, 2012)]</ref> Ahava was mentioned by name as a company whose goods were fraudulently labeled as <U+201C>Product of Israel<U+201D> when their place of origin is the occupied Palestinian Territories.

Ahava's store in a fashionable street of [[London]]'s West End closed in September 2011 after constant protests by anti-Israeli activists. Owners of the surrounding stores complained to the landlord [[Shaftesbury plc]] that the repeated protests were affecting their business. A pro-Israeli group also held fortnightly counter-demonstrations, which attracted renewed controversy when members of the far-right [[English Defence League]] turned up, unasked, and joined in the demonstrations in support of Ahava.<ref>[http://www.salem-news.com/articles/september052011/bds-campaign-gm.php Is BDS Campaign Working?]</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Ahava <U+FB01>nally closes its doors in London |author=Jessica Elgot |url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/55465/ahava-%EF%AC%81nally-closes-its-doors-london |newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle |date=2011-09-27 |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>

In 2012, the British [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] was denounced in a letter signed by a group of 21 prominent academics and cultural figures for participating in a joint European Union-funded research programme with Ahava. The signatories said that "[Ahava-DSL] extracts, processes and exports Palestinian resources to generate profits that fund an illegal settlement. Israel's settlement project has been held... to break international law. Organisations which aid and abet this process may well themselves be found to be in violation." The museum said Ahava-DSL was chosen from a list approved by the European Commission and they "would not participate in any academic or educational boycotts that could restrict academic freedom".<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/natural-history-museum-attacked-over-links-to-illegal-israeli-company-6290705.html Natural History Museum attacked over links to 'illegal' Israeli company (The Independent, January 17, 2012)]</ref>

As part of the [[Israel <U+2013> European Union relations#The EU-Israel Association Agreement .282000.29|economic agreement]] between Israel and the [[European Union]], Israel cannot label products made in the West Bank as "made in Israel"; products made in the West Bank are subject to higher tariffs compared to products made in Israel.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8538251.stm EU: Goods made at Jewish settlements are not Israeli (BBC, Feb. 26, 2010)]</ref> In November 2009, Dutch MP Van Bommel (Socialist Party) asked Dutch FM Verhagen (CDA) whether or not Ahava products that were marketed at the time in the Netherlands originated from the Palestinian Territories. If so, Ahava would not be entitled to a tax-exemption at Dutch customs.<ref name="officielebekendmakingen1">[https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/kst-23432-318.html?zoekcriteria=%3fzkt%3dEenvoudig%26pst%3d%26vrt%3dahava%26zkd%3dInDeGeheleText%26dpr%3dAfgelopenDag%26sdt%3dDatumBrief%26ap%3d%26pnr%3d1%26rpp%3d10&resultIndex=3&sorttype=1&sortorder=4 nr. 318 BRIEF VAN DE STAATSSECRETARIS VAN ECONOMISCHE ZAKEN]</ref> Verhagen promised to launch an investigation through the Dutch customs authority.<ref>[http://www.nu.nl/politiek/2122232/verhagen-gelast-onderzoek-israelische-cosmetica.html Verhagen gelast onderzoek naar Isra<U+00EB>lische cosmetica]</ref> In February 2010, the state-secretary of Economic Affairs Heemskerk responded to Van Bommel through a letter to the Dutch Parliament, saying records for the years 2007-2009 indicated that Dutch customs had not given tax-exemption to Ahava products.<ref name="officielebekendmakingen1"/>
