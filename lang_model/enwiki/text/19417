'''Jan Jacobszoon Hinlopen''' (1626 - 1666) or Jan J. Hinlopen was a rich Dutch cloth merchant, real estate developer, city [[schepen]] and a keen art collector.  His paintings are dispersed all over the world.  Jan J. Hinlopen was a maecenas for the arts and is mentioned as an influential protector of [[Rembrandt]]. Like his father-in-law Hinlopen is known because of the poems by [[Jan Vos (poet)|Jan Vos]] on the paintings in his house, quite unique in art history.

Two of [[Gabriel Metsu]]'s finest paintings, depict the Hinlopen family. These painting are exhibited in the New York [[Metropolitan Museum]] and the Berlin [[Gem<U+00E4>ldegalerie, Berlin|Gem<U+00E4>ldegalerie]]. Both paintings where probably created for a large room of the city hall.<ref>[[Geert Mak|Mak, G.]] (1997) Het stadspaleis, p. 43.</ref>  It is unclear how many Gabriel Metsu paintings Hinlopen had in his possession. He, his wife or children may have acted as models more than once. 

==Life==
Jan J. Hinlopen was the son of the merchant [[Jacob J. Hinlopen]] (1582-1629), who traded spices and [[ship chandler]]y.  The family originally came from [[Flanders]], but after Antwerp had been occupied by the Spanish, they moved to Amsterdam, at [[Nieuwendijk]], close to the harbour. Jan J. Hinlopen lived initially with his brother [[Jacob J. Hinlopen]] at Leliegracht, on the corner of [[Keizersgracht]].  The brothers made money from a cloth business in [[Warmoesstraat]] and the building of cheap houses in the [[Jordaan]].  After their mother, who came from a rich Catholic family, died, they inherited a mansion designed by [[Philips Vingboons]], situated in the country between Baarn, Soest and Hilversum. 

Trying to make a career in the city hall, the brothers enrolled in the [[schutterij|Civic guard]]. [[Jacob J. Hinlopen]] had an annoying problem when the town hall was opened in 1655 with speeches and festivities. He was asked to leave the city for one day. In 1657, Jan J. Hinlopen married Leonore Huydecoper of Maarseveen (1631-1663), the daughter of a rich and influential mayor, with a country house in [[Maarssen]], nicely situated on the border of the river [[Vecht]].  [[Jan Vos]] mounted a performance of five shows for the occasion, with accompanying poems.  Every show consisted of at least thirty to forty scenes in an allegorical manner, for example on the despairs of Amsterdam during the plague epidemic:{{cquote|''He had [[Apollo]] and [[Themis]], then [[Athena|Pallas]] and House-Pride, enjoying plays.  Caution, Cleverness, Politeness and Reasonableness stand at one side of the throne; Charm, Kindness, Pity and Wakefulness at the other...'' <ref>translated from W. Frijhoff & M. Spies (1999) Bevochten eendracht 1650, p. 456-7. (In Dutch.)</ref>}}
The couple had four children - Jacob, Johanna Maria, Sara, and Geertrui.  They were baptized in the [[Westerkerk]].

[[Image:Kraambezoek.jpg|330px|thumb|left|''The Visit to the Nursery'', by Gabriel Metsu, now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (1661).  Presumably painted after the birth of Sara Hinlopen.  Jan Vos wrote the poem ''the Kraamvrouw'' ("Woman in Childbed") about this painting.<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=11&item=17.190.20&viewmode=1&isHighlight=0 Metropolitan Museum of Art ''The Nursery'' by Gabriel Metsu]</ref>]]

In 1661, after his father-in-law died, Jan was offered a position in the new [[Royal Palace (Amsterdam)|town hall]] on [[Dam Square]].  In the autumn of 1663, within two weeks Jan J. Hinlopen lost his youngest daughter and his wife as a consequence of the plague.  According to [[Samuel Pepys]], ships from Hamburg and Amsterdam were quarantined for thirty days. In 1664, 24,148 people were buried in Amsterdam and people supposed the plague was caused by the digging of new canals.  Jan remarried with Lucia Wijbrants, after her brother had married his sister.<ref>It is mentioned by the ''Weeskamer'', a board that controlled the orphans' heritage, that he had three children and that their mother's inheritance was "regulated", but remarkably, the notary is not named.</ref>  His only son, Jacob, died in 1665.  Jan J. Hinlopen had himself portrayed with his new wife by [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]], with his deceased first wife and children in the background.<ref>Dudok van Heel, S.A.C., (1996) Een opmerkelijke dikzak. Jan Hinlopen door Bartholomeus van der Helst, In: Maandblad Amstelodamum, p. 161-166. (In Dutch.)</ref>  

===Death===
Jan J. Hinlopen died shortly after Van der Helst produced his painting, forty years of age and of rather stocky build. It is not recorded whether Jan too had fallen victim to the plague, but it is clearly recorded that 1664, 1665 and 1666 were also plague years and more than 10% to 15% of the population died and that everybody that came into contact with the plague was at risk.<ref>Noordegraaf, L. & G. Valk (1988) De Gave Gods. De pest in Holland vanaf de late Middeleeuwen, p. 230. (In Dutch.)</ref>  In June [[1665]] the [[Great Plague of London]] broke out. As in Amsterdam, rich people left the cities.  Sailors sailing on sea were relatively safe.

===Aftermath===
Johanna Maria and Sara Hinlopen did not get along with their stepmother, not only because of the inheritance, which seems to have not been arranged very well.<ref>Goudbeek, R. (z.j.) Geelvinck Hinlopen Huis. Geschiedenis van het Huis en zijn Bewoners (1687-1998) (In Dutch.)</ref>  Lucia Wijbrants made the best of a bad bargain and remarried a mayor of Utrecht in 1672.  Neither of the uncles and guardians, [[Jacob J. Hinlopen]] and mayor [[Joan Huydecoper of Maarsseveen]], were popular with the fairly independent and very rich girls, and as soon as possible they tried to gain full independence.  Joan was eager to have Johanna Maria marry her cousin, Joan's eldest son, but significantly she refused.<ref>Kooymans, L. (1997) Vriendschap en de kunst van het overleven in de zeventiende en achttiende eeuw, p. XX (In Dutch.) </ref>

In 1679 Johanna Maria Hinlopen married Johan van der Merct, a lawyer from [[Middelburg]], in the church of [[Amstelveen]].  Sara also chose a romantic location for her marriage with [[Albert Geelvinck]]: the church of [[Sloterdijk]], a pleasure resort only a few miles outside the citywalls and along the [[IJ (bay)|IJ]] and in those days a popular spot to marry.

==Collection==
[[Image:Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn- Assuerus, Haman and Esther.JPG|330px|thumb|''[[Ahasuerus]] and [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] at the feast of [[Esther|Esther]]'', by Rembrandt (1660).  Pushkin Museum, Moscow]]
After the completion in 1660, [[Rembrandt]] sold the painting ''[[Ahasuerus]] and [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] at the feast of [[Esther|Esther]]'' to Jan J. Hinlopen.<ref>Dudok van Heel, S.A.C. (1969) De Rembrandt's in de verzamelingen Hinlopen. In: Maandblad Amstelodamum, pp. 233-237. (In Dutch.)</ref>  This painting is possibly one of the few Rembrandt paintings whose provenance can be traced back to 1662, two years after its completion.  In that year a book of poems by Jan Vos appeared, some of them about paintings in the collection of Jan J. Hinlopen.<ref>Jan Vos (1726) Alle de gedichten van Jan Vos, pp. 360-3; see also pp. 388, 516, 536. (In Dutch.)</ref>  
<center>
''Here one sees Haman eating with Ahasuerus and Esther.<br>
''But it is in vain; his breast is full of regret and pain.<br>
''He eats Esther's food; but deeper into her heart.<br>
''The king is mad with revenge and rage.<br>
''The wrath of a monarch...<ref>In: Slive, S. (1953) Rembrandt and his critics, 1630-1730, p. 52.</ref></center>

The reason for the painting was the play ''Hester'', by Johannes Serwouters (1623-1677).  Provoked by the [[pogrom]]s in Eastern Europe, it was performed in 1659 and dedicated to his wife Leonore.<ref>Schwartz, G. (2006) Rembrandts Universe, His Art His Life His World, p. 112; Schwartz, G. (1987) Rembrandt, zijn leven, zijn schilderijen. Een nieuwe biografie met alle beschikbare schilderijen in kleur afgebeeld, p. 272-6.</ref>  The [[Rembrandt]] is now in the collection of the [[Pushkin Museum]]). 

Also in Hinlopen's house on [[Kloveniersburgwal]] were a [[Rubens]], two paintings by [[Jan Lievens]], one by [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]]. Jan also possessed two paintings by [[Jan Lievens]] (''The raising of [[Lazarus]]'', now in Bristol<ref>[http://www.virtualmuseum.info/art/hp_pre20th/lievens_jan.asp ''The raising of Lazarus'' by Jan Lievens (1631)]</ref>, and a ''Christ in the tomb''), a painting of flowers by [[Willem van Aelst]], and a ''Simon in the temple with Christ as a child'' by [[Gerbrand van den Eeckhout]].  In his sitting room hung a ''Venus in a cloud full of [[Cupid]]s'' by [[Rubens]], which he inherited from his father-in-law.  In several poems, Jan Vos praised Jan's collection of paintings and the pieces of [[amber]] that were given to Leonora by [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], the [[elector]] of [[Brandenburg]], and also wrote on the premature death of Jan's wife and children.

===Controversy===
There is controversy among some art historians about one of the paintings by Metsu, now in the [[Gem<U+00E4>ldegalerie]], which was already known in the 19th century as ''Familie des Kaufmanns Gelfing''.<ref>[http://susi.e-technik.uni-ulm.de:8080/Meyers2/seite/werk/meyers/band/11/seite/0549/meyers_b11_s0549.html#Metsu Meyers Konversationlexicon (1885-1892)] (In German.)</ref>  (For an impression of the painting, this URL is informative).<ref>http://cgfa.sunsite.dk/metsu/metsu2.jpg The original is in the [[Gem<U+00E4>ldegalerie]], Berlin</ref>  Gelfing should be understood as coming from the family Geelvinck, after both families Hinlopen en Geelvinck died out in 18th century. Since 1976 the painting has been called by Van Eeghen ''La famille du Burgermeister Gillis Valckenier, Gabriel Metsu, 1657'' on not very satifactory grounds: the bird, which she recognized as a falcon.<ref>Eeghen, I.H. van (1976) DE FAMILIESTUKKEN VAN METSU VAN 1657 EN VAN DE WITTE VAN 1678 MET VIER LEVENSGESCHIEDENISSEN (GILLIS VALCKENIER, NICOLAAS LISTINGH, JAN ZEEUW EN CATHARINA VAN DE PERRE). In: Jrb Amstelodamum, pp. 78-82. (In Dutch.)</ref> Her explanation of how the painting got to Switzerland is complicated and hardly convincing, and for that reason need not be repeated here.  Besides, burgomaster [[Gillis Valckenier]] had only three children at that time.<ref>[https://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/archieven/archiefbank/indexen/doopregisters/zoek/search.nl.pl?v1=Gill*&b1=&a1=Val*&r1=1&v2=J*&b2=&a2=R*&r2=0&d1=&m1=&y1=&d2=&m2=&y2=&rs=0&x=51&y=6 Birth certificates of six children from Gillis Valckenier and Jacoba Ranst]</ref>  Irene Groeneweg has good arguments for the view that the bird is not a [[falcon]] but a [[Cuban Amazon]].<ref>Groeneweg, I. (1995) Regenten in het zwart: vroom en deftig? In: R. Falkenburg, e.a. (red) Beeld en zelfbeeld in de Nederlandse kunst, 1550-1750, pp. 200-4 (Nederlands Kunsthistorisch Jaarboek, dl. 46) (In Dutch.) </ref> Judith van Gent suggests that the painting in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] called ''A Visit to the Nursery'' also depicts the family Hinlopen (and most probably Sara Hinlopen as a baby).<ref>Gent, J. van, (1998) Portretten van Jan Jacobsz Hinlopen en zijn familie door Gabri<U+00EB>l Metsu en Bartholomeus van der Helst. In: Oud Holland 112, pp. 127-138. (In Dutch.)</ref>  The provenance of that painting is clear and is generally accepted. It comes from [[Jan Jacobsz. Hinlopen]]. 

Part of Jan's collection passed to his daughter Sara, who died childless at 89 years old and nearly blind.  Most of her belongings went to the second cousin and nieces of her late husband [[Albert Geelvinck]], though in her will there is nothing about any painting because of inheritance duties.
