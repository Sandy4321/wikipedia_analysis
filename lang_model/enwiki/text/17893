== History ==
The three firms which now form the core of Mayer Brown were all founded in the 19th century.  The US portion of the firm was founded in 1881 in Chicago, by [[Adolf Kraus]] and [[Levi Mayer]], and was shortly thereafter known as ''Kraus, Mayer & Brackett''. After several changes in name to reflect its changing membership the firm eventually became known in the US as ''Mayer, Brown & Platt''.  The English portion of the firm, ''Rowe & Maw'', was established in 1895 in [[London]] and operated under that name until joining with ''Mayer, Brown & Platt'' in 2002 to form ''Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw''.  In 2007 the amalgamated firm shortened its name to ''Mayer Brown''.  [[Johnson Stokes & Master|JSM]] (formerly [[Johnson Stokes & Master]]) was formed in 1863 in [[Hong Kong]] and is today known as [[Mayer Brown JSM]] after merging with ''Mayer Brown'' in 2008.

== Offices ==
The firm has offices in [[Chicago]], [[Charlotte]], [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]], [[Houston]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New York]], [[Palo Alto]], [[Sao Paulo]], [[Washington DC]], [[London]], [[Brussels]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Paris]], [[Bangkok]], [[Beijing]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Shanghai]], [[Singapore]], [[Hanoi]], [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Hong Kong]] and, in association with [[Tauil & Chequer Avogados]], offices in [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. 

In addition, Mayer Brown has an alliance with the [[Spain|Spanish]] firm [[Ramon & Cajal]].
