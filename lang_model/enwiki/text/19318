'''Karl Gunnar Vougt Pontus Hult<U+00E9>n''' ([[June 21]] [[1924]] <U+2013> [[October 26]] [[2006]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] art collector and museum director. Pontus Hult<U+00E9>n is regarded as one of the world<U+2019>s most distinguished museum professionals of our time. He was the pioneering former head of the [[Moderna Museet|Museum for modern art]] in Stockholm and in the 1970s he was invited to participate in the creation the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in [[Paris]], where he was its first director in [[1974]]-[[1981]].

==Biography ==
Pontus Hult<U+00E9>n was born in [[Stockholm]]; he studied art history at [[Stockholm University]] and during the 1950s he was a [[curator]] at a small [[art gallery]] and also organized film screenings. 

===Moderna Museet ===

In [[1960]], Hult<U+00E9>n was named head of the [[Moderna Museet]], shaping the museum into a powerhouse of modern art. Under Hult<U+00E9>n, the Moderna Museet was to be one of the most dynamic [[contemporary art]] institutions of the 1960s. During his tenure, the museum played a seminal role in bridging the gap between Europe and America, staging numerous exhibitions with works by early modern artists like [[Vincent van Gogh]], modernists [[Paul Klee]], [[Ren<U+00E9> Magritte]], [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and also Swedish artists including [[Sven Erixson]], [[Bror Hjorth]] and [[Sigrid Hjert<U+00E9>n]]. 

Hult<U+00E9>n organized theme exhibitions including ''4 Americans'' in [[1962]] with pop artists [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]], as did solo exhibitions with [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Edward Kienholz]]. Followed in [[1964]] by one of the first European surveys of American Pop art. In return, Hult<U+00E9>n was invited to curate an exhibition at [[New York]]'s [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[1968]]: his first historical and Interdisciplinary show, it explored the machine in art, photography, and industrial design.

Following ''<U+00D6>nskemuseet'' (The Museum of our Wishes) in the winter of  [[1963]]-[[1964]], Hult<U+00E9>n persuaded the Swedish government a one-time grant of 5 million kronor to help the museum expand its collection with works by [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Joan Mir<U+00F3>]], [[Salvador Dal<U+00ED>]], [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. The museum won international fame in [[1966]] with the exhibition ''SHE <U+2013> A Cathedral'', which consisted of a gigantic sculpture of a reclining woman whose womb was an entrance for visitors who could experience various things inside. The artists behind the work were [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[Jean Tinguely]] and Pontus Hult<U+00E9>n himself. The [[1968]] exhibition ''Andy Warhol'', was [[Andy Warhol]]'s first retrospective ever. According to author and art critic Carl-Johan Malmberg:

<blockquote> "''[Pontus Hult<U+00E9>n] understood what good art was way before others did, and was therefore way ahead of his times''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_13943899.asp|title=Moderna museets pionj<U+00E4>r har avlidit|publisher=Svenska Dagbladet|date=2006-10-27|accessdate=2006-10-27}}</ref></blockquote>

===Centre Pompidou ===
In 1973, Hult<U+00E9>n left Stockholm to enter one of the most significant periods of his career. As founding director of the new museum of modern art at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], which opened in 1977, Hult<U+00E9>n organized large-scale shows that examined the making of art's history through the links between artistic capitals: ''Paris-Berlin'', ''Paris-Moscow'', ''Paris-New York'', and ''Paris-Paris'' included not only art objects that ranged from [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] to [[Pop music|Pop]], but films, posters, documentation, and reconstructions of exhibition spaces such as [[Gertrude Stein]]'s salon. Multivalent and interdisciplinary, these shows marked a paradigm shift in exhibition making, entering the collective memory of generations of artists, curators, and [[critic]]s as few others have.

===Later career ===
Hult<U+00E9>n's career after Centre Pompidou reflected the same commitment to working closely with artists that has caused so many to remember him fondly. Invited by [[Robert Irwin]] and [[Sam Francis]] to establish the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA)]]. Hult<U+00E9>n went to [[Los Angeles]] in [[1980]], but, after four years of infrequent exhibitions and much fundraising, returned to Europe. In [[1984]]-[[1990]], he was in charge of [[Palazzo Grassi]] in [[Venice]], and in [[1985]], he founded, along with [[Daniel Buren]], [[Serge Fauchereau]], and [[Sarkis]], the [[Institut des Hautes Etudes en Arts Plastiques]] in [[Paris]], which Hult<U+00E9>n described as a cross between the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Black Mountain College]]. In [[1991]]-[[1995]], Hult<U+00E9>n was the Artistic director of the [[Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle]] in [[Bonn]]. He later became the director of the [[Jean Tinguely museum]] in [[Basel]], where he curated the inaugural exhibition. Of Pontus Hult<U+00E9>n, [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] once said: 
<blockquote>"''[he had] the soul of an artist, not of a museum director.''"<ref>''The hang of it - museum director Pontus Hult<U+00E9>n - Interview'', by Hans-Ulrich Obrist, in ''Artforum'', No. 4, 1997.</ref></blockquote>

===Legacy ===
Pontus Hult<U+00E9>n defined the museum as an elastic and open space, hosting a plethora of activities within its walls: lectures, film series, concerts, and debates. Hult<U+00E9>n always maintained a very special dialogue with artists, establishing lifelong friendships with Sam Francis, Jean Tinguely, and Niki de St. Phalle, whose careers he not only followed but shaped from the start. Hult<U+00E9>n devoted his life to art and being an avid art collector, he donated his private collection of 700 works to the Moderna Museet in November [[2005]]. One of his requests was that the donated works should not be hung as part of the collection, but should be accessible to the public in a user-friendly viewing storehouse <U+2013> a typically Hult<U+00E9>nesque solution that would give the public the freedom to browse among the masterpieces as in an art library. After retiring, he lived his last years in Paris and in Stockholm where he died.
