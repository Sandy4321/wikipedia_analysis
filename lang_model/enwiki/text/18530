'''USCGC ''Citrus''''' (WAGL-300/WLB-300/WMEC-300) was a ''Cactus'' (A)-class [[USCG Seagoing Buoy Tender|seagoing buoy tender]] built in 1942 in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], and now operated by the navy of the [[Dominican Republic]]. 

During [[World War II]], the 180-foot ship helped build [[LORAN]]  stations on the [[Aleutian Islands]]. From 1945 to 1979, ''Citrus'' largely helped maintain [[Navigational aid|aids to navigation]] in [[Alaska]]n waters. In 1980, she was converted into a medium-endurance cutter homeported at [[Coos Bay, Oregon]]. 

In 1995, after 51 years' service, it was transferred to the [[Dominican Navy]], which commissioned it the ''Almirante Juan Alejandro Acosta''.<ref name = citrus>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Citrus, 1942 | work = Cutters, Craft & Coast Guard-Manned Army & Navy Vessels | publisher = [[US Coast Guard]] | date =

==Ship's history==
After the Coast Guard took over the [[United States Lighthouse Service]] in 1939, the plans for the USLS ''Juniper'' class of {{convert|177|ft|m|abbr=on|0}} seagoing buoy tenders were modified to {{convert|180|ft|m|abbr=on|0}}. These were built in three classes. The ''Cactus'' (A) class had 12 vessels, the ''Mesquite'' (B) class had six, and the ''Iris'' (C) class had 20. Twenty were built at one of two shipyards in [[Duluth, Minnesota]].<ref name=HAER/> 

''Citrus'' was laid down 29 April 1942 at the Marine Iron & Shipbuilding Corporation in Duluth. She was launched on 15 August 1942 and commissioned on 3 April 1943.<ref name=citrus/><ref name=HAER/>

===World War II===

USCGC ''Citrus'' was initially assigned to the Ninth District in April 1943. With home port in [[Detroit, Michigan]], the cutter was to be used for general aids to navigation and icebreaking on the [[Great Lakes]]. 

The cutter was re-assigned to Alaska Sector, Northwestern Sea Frontier on 15 September 1943. Construction work on the Western Aleutian LORAN chain began during the latter part of 1943. Beginning in November 1943, men and materials began to arrive at sites 62 ([[Sitka]]), 63 ([[Amchitka]]), and 64 ([[Attu Station, Alaska|Attu]]). ''Citrus'' and two [[Liberty ship]]s, [[List of Liberty ships: G-Je|SS ''George Flavel'']] and SS ''McKenzie'', transported Coast Guard construction crews to erect [[Quonset hut]]s for Construction Detachment "A" at [[Massacre Bay]], Attu and at [[Attu Station, Alaska|Baxter Cove]], Adak. Unloading at Adak was done with 5' x 7' steel pontoon-type barges. They arrived on 24 December 1943. Heavy ground swells made unloading materiel from the cutter to the barge precarious. Despite the possibility of a sudden squall, both barges made the beach about sundown. Temporary floodlights were then rigged and unloading operations continued until 1200 on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]]. As the storm increased in intensity, ''Citrus'' was unable to maintain her anchorage and was forced to return to Massacre Bay  until the storm subsided on 2 January 1944.<ref name=citrus/><ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Coast Guard at War: IV LORAN | work = Historian's Office | publisher =[[US Coast Guard]] | date =   | url = http://www.uscg.mil/history/stations/LORAN_Section_3.asp | format = | doi = | accessdate = 16 March 2009}}</ref> 

Early in February 1944, a five-day storm swept the Massacre Bay area with winds up to {{convert|125|mph|km/h|abbr=on|0}}. At Attu, ''Citrus'' took nine men off a swamped Army tug without loss of life and then sank the foundering tug with gunfire. ''Citrus'' also assisted in getting a Liberty ship off the beach after it had been driven ashore by a severe storm. The ''Citrus'' arrived at [[Ketchikan]] on 7 February 1944.<ref name=citrus/> 

On 20 February, ''Citrus'' was dispatched to assist ''Mary D'' which was hard aground on Point St. Alban's Reef. With the assistance of USCGC ''Hemlock'' and ''LT-151''. ''Mary D'' was re-floated. After jettisoning some cargo, she could continue on to Ketchikan. On 27 February 1944, ''Citrus'' was dispatched to the assistance of Army tug USAT ''ST-169'' in distress in Chatham Strait after losing its crib tow. 

On 17 October 1944 ''Citrus'' departed [[Petersburg, Alaska|Petersburg]] to render assistance to ATS ''Brunswick'' aground in [[Wrangell Narrows]]. ''Citrus'' pulled her afloat and the latter continued on under its own power. ''Citrus'' spent the remainder of the war conducting aids to navigation, logistics, and vessel escort duties in Southwestern Alaskan waters.<ref name=citrus/>

===Postwar===

From the end of the war until 29 June 1964, ''Citrus'' continued to be stationed at Ketchikan and conducted aids to navigation duties. On 9 September 1948, ''Citrus'' assisted MV ''Caledonia'' in Idaho Inlet. From 29-31 October 1948, the tender assisted [[USNS Mission Santa Cruz (T-AO-133)|USNS ''Mission Santa Cruz'']].<ref name=citrus/> 

From 13-19 February 1950, ''Citrus'' searched for a missing [[USAF]] plane near the [[Wrangell Narrows]]. During 25-27 August 1950, the cutter provided assistance to the barge ''Bisco 3'' near Ratz Harbor and a fishing vessel ''Vermay'' near [[Cape Muzon]], and towed the power scow ''Chichagof'' near Cape Chacon.<ref name=citrus/> 

On 19 May 1951, ''Citrus'' escorted USCGC ''White Holly'' to Ketchikan after the latter struck a rock. On 25 May 1951, ''Citrus'' assisted fishing vessel ''Dolores'' near Point Gardner and from 21-27 July 1951 the cutter searched for a missing Canadian [[DC-4]].<ref name=citrus/> 

During 15-19 January 1952, ''Citrus'' escorted USCGC ''Cahoone'' to Sitka. On 8 June 1952, the cutter towed the fishing vessel ''Pioneer'' to [[Ketchikan]] and assisted the fishing vessel ''Hobo'' near [[Lincoln Island (Alaska)|Lincoln Island]] on 13 August 1952. Ten days later, on 23 August 1952 ''Citrus'' assisted the fishing vessel ''Cinuk'' in the [[Behm Canal]].<ref name=citrus/> 

On 24 August 1953, it helped the  tug ''Saturn'' recover its lost tow at 56<U+00B0> 25' N, 14<U+00B0> 28' W. ''Citrus'' then spent 25-30 August 1953 searching for, finding, and towing a scow to Ketchikan. On 13 October 1953, ''Citrus'' assisted the grounded ''APL-55'' near the Dangerous River.<ref name=citrus/> 

From 30 June 1964 to 1979 ''Citrus'' was  stationed at [[Kodiak, Alaska]] and used for aids to navigation. On 12 February 1965, she located two Russian [[fishing vessel]]s {{convert|3.4|mi|km|abbr=on|1}} from U.S. territory. After notification of their location, they departed.<ref name=citrus/>

On 8 March 1965, the cutter's crew fought a fire on MV ''Kalaikh'' off Alaska and towed it to Kodiak.  On 3 May 1965, ''Citrus'' flew a seaman from the Russian fishing vessel ''Churkzn'' to Kodiak Island.<ref name=citrus/> 

From 24 to 26 January 1968, the crew fought a fire on the Japanese MV ''Seifu Maru'' in [[Dutch Harbor]]. On 9 August 1968, the distressed MV ''Dantzler'' was assisted after a grounding and escorted the ship from near [[Cook Inlet]] to [[Homer, Alaska]].<ref name=citrus/>

On 1 April 1969, the cutter flew a patient from the fishing vessel ''Zulyo Maru'' off Alaska. On 8 May 1970, the cutter towed the disabled fishing vessel ''Shirley Rose'' to Kodiak. On 20 October 1970, the crew removed 31 from the grounded ferry ''Tustumena'' near Kodiak.<ref name=citrus/> 

On 19 January 1974 ''Citrus'' searched for missing crew members from the trawler ''John and Olaf'' in the [[Gulf of Alaska]]. 

On 27 February 1979. the cutter struck a submerged object in the Ouzinkie Narrows between Kodiak and [[Spruce Island]]s. Although there were no casualties, the ship sustained significant damage. In March 1979 ''Citrus'' was converted to a [[USCG Medium Endurance Cutter|medium-endurance cutter]].<ref name=citrus/>

===Medium-endurance cutter duty===

[[File:USCG Citrus-MV Pacific Star Aflame-1JAN85.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|MV ''Pacific Star'' after ramming the USCG ''Citrus'']]
Upon her conversion to a medium endurance cutter, ''Citrus''{{'}} home port was [[Coos Bay, Oregon]]. The cutter's mission was primarily law enforcement and search and rescue. Her primary law enforcement activities involved the boarding of domestic and foreign fishing vessels.<ref name=citrus/> 
 
After attempting to send a boarding party for a drug search on 1 January 1985, ''Citrus'' was rammed by the Panamanian MV ''Pacific Star'' {{convert|680|mi|km|abbr=on|0}} southwest of [[San Diego]]. ''Pacific Star'' was scuttled by its crew. Seven crewmen were rescued and {{convert|1000|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}} of [[marijuana]] was seized.<ref name=citrus/><ref>{{cite web  | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = January | work = Daily Chronology of Coast Guard History | publisher =[[US Coast Guard]]  | date = 1985 | url = http://www.uscg.mil/history/Chronology_Jan.asp | format = | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Rosen | first = Dave | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = A Brief History of the USCG PACAREA Intelligence Division | work = | publisher =[[US Coast Guard]] | date = | url = http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/PiHistory2009.pdf | format = | doi = | accessdate = 16 March 2009}}</ref>
