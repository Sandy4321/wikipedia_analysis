[[Air Marshal]] '''Sir John Patrick Joseph McCauley''', [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Companion of the Order of the Bath|CB]] (18&nbsp;March 1899 <U+2013> 26&nbsp;January 1989) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). He served as [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] from 1954 to 1957. A [[Royal Military College, Duntroon|Duntroon]] graduate, McCauley spent four years in the [[Australian Military Forces]] before transferring to the RAAF in 1924. He was Director of Training from 1936 to 1938, and commanded engineering and flying training schools for the first eighteen months of World War&nbsp;II. Having been promoted to [[group captain]] in 1940, he was posted to [[Singapore]] in June 1941 to take charge of all RAAF units defending the area. He earned praise for his efforts in attacking invading Japanese forces before the [[fall of Singapore]], and for his dedication in evacuating his men. After serving as [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]] in 1942<U+2013>44, he was appointed to a senior operational role with the [[Royal Air Force]]'s [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in Europe, where he saw out the rest of the war.

Following the end of hostilities, McCauley again became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff. In 1947 he was promoted to [[air vice marshal]] and appointed [[Chief of Staff]] at [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force|British Commonwealth Occupation Force Headquarters]] in Japan.  Returning to Australia in June 1949, he served as the last [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Eastern Area and the inaugural AOC of Home Command (now [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]]). Raised to air marshal, he took up the position of Chief of the Air Staff in January 1954, and was [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|knighted]] a year later. During his tenure in the RAAF's senior role, McCauley focussed on potential deployments to Southeast Asia&mdash;particularly [[Vietnam]]&mdash;and threats from the north, commencing redevelopment of [[RAAF Base Darwin]] and recommending purchase of a light [[supersonic]] bomber to replace the Air Force's [[English Electric Canberra]]. After retiring from military life in March 1957, he chaired various community and welfare organisations, serving as Federal President of the Air Force Association for ten years. He died in [[Sydney]] in 1989, aged 89.

Promoted to [[squadron leader]], McCauley was posted a third time to Britain in 1933, graduating from [[RAF Staff College, Andover]], and qualifying as a [[flight instructor]] at [[Central Flying School]], [[RAF Wittering|Wittering]].

McCauley's seniority and instructional experience kept him in Australia on training assignments for the first eighteen months of World War&nbsp;II. From March to October 1940, he served as the inaugural commander of No.&nbsp;1 Engineering School at [[Ascot Vale, Victoria|Ascot Vale]], Victoria.<ref name="Dennis"/><ref>RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', pp. 36<U+2013>37</ref> Promoted to [[group captain]], he then took over [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 Service Flying Training School]] at Point Cook until July 1941, when he handed over to Wing Commander [[Elwyn King]].

During the [[Malayan Campaign]] in 1941<U+2013>42, McCauley was in charge of RAAF units under Britain's [[Far East Air Force (Royal Air Force)|Far East Air Force]] (FEAF).<ref name="Going Solo pp.41-44"/> As station commander at [[Sembawang Air Base|RAF Sembawang]] in north-east [[Singapore]] from August 1941,<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=38216|supp=yes|startpage=1415|date=20 February 1948|accessdate= on 10 April 2011}}</ref><ref>Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/07.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942'', p. 167]</ref> he personally supervised the training and operations of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&nbsp;1]] and [[No. 8 Squadron RAAF|8 Squadrons]], flying [[Lockheed Hudson]] light bombers.

After his return to Australia late in February 1942, McCauley briefly served as Senior Air Staff Officer at North Western Area Headquarters in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory. He took up the position of [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]] (DCAS) in May, and was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the 1943 [[King's Birthday Honours]], promulgated on 2&nbsp;June.<ref name="Dennis"/><ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=36033|supp=yes|startpage=2430|date=2 June 1943|accessdate=on 10 April 2011}}</ref> The honour recognised the "courage, ability, and qualities of leadership" he displayed under "trying and difficult conditions during a period of service in the Far East".<ref name="CBE">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17850941 |title=Careers of those honoured |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=Sydney |date=2 June 1943 |accessdate=on 12 April 2011 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The following month, he was promoted to temporary [[air commodore]].<ref name="How Not to Run an Air Force">Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', pp. 289<U+2013>291</ref> During an inspection of [[Australian First Tactical Air Force|No.&nbsp;10 Group]] at [[Lae Nadzab Airport|Nadzab]] in March 1944, McCauley learned that unless the Australian formation was able to increase its operational rate of effort, its units would be withdrawn from their forward airfields. As a result, RAAF Headquarters increased the supply of pilots and equipment to the group, which was then able to meet, and later exceed, the rate of effort achieved by comparable US [[Fifth Air Force]] units.<ref>Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/12.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 194]</ref> At around this time, he also instigated a research program to determine a suitable formula for rotating and relieving [[groundcrew|ground staff]], as well as [[aircrew]], in the tropics.<ref>Mellor, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/34/chapters/28.pdf ''Science and Industry'', pp. 667<U+2013>668]</ref> 

Completing his term as DCAS, McCauley was posted to the [[European Theatre of World War II|European theatre]] in November 1944, serving for the remainder of the war as Air Commodore (Operations), [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force RAF]] (2nd TAF).<ref name="Dennis"/><ref name="Air Power Over Europe">Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/12.pdf ''Air Power Over Europe'', p. 279]</ref> The British had actively sought him for this particular appointment, which he commenced in December at the formation's [[Brussels]] headquarters.<ref name="APDC">[http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=300 Senior post for McCauley on RAF 2nd TAF] at Royal Australian Air Force.

Among a small coterie of wartime RAAF commanders earmarked for further senior roles, McCauley retained his rank of air commodore following the cessation of hostilities.<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 24<U+2013>25</ref><ref>Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp. 238<U+2013>239</ref> He served again as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1946<U+2013>47.<ref name="Air Power Over Europe"/> Promoted to [[air vice marshal]], he was [[Chief of Staff]] to Lieutenant General [[Horace Robertson]] at [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] Headquarters in Japan, from June 1947 to June 1949.<ref name="Dennis"/><ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 209</ref> Upon his return to Australia, McCauley was made [[Air Officer Commanding]] Eastern Area Command. During the [[Malayan Emergency]], he formed RAAF aircraft assigned for deployment into No.&nbsp;90 (Composite) Wing, as directed by Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], to ensure that they would operate autonomously rather than be dispersed throughout other Allied groups.<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 246<U+2013>247</ref><ref name="Helson pp.274-275">Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp. 274<U+2013>275</ref>  He was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in the 1951 Birthday Honours.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=39244|supp=yes|startpage=3095|date=1 June 1951|accessdate=on 10 April 2011}}</ref>

In January 1952, Air Marshal Jones was succeeded by Air Marshal [[Donald Hardman|Sir Donald Hardman]] of the [[Royal Air Force]]. The decision by Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] to appoint a British officer as CAS caused controversy in Australia, compounded by his stated reason that there was "no RAAF officer of sufficient age, or operational experience, to take the post of Chief of the Air Staff", which ignored the wartime records of figures like McCauley.<ref name="Going Solo pp.73-74">Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 73<U+2013>74</ref> Hardman changed the structure of the Air Force from one based on geographical area to one based on function, hence McCauley's Eastern Area Command evolved into Home Command (now [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]]) in 1953.<ref name="Going Solo pp.41-44"/><ref>Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp. 293<U+2013>294</ref> Promoted to [[air marshal]], McCauley took over from Hardman as Chief of the Air Staff when the latter's two-year appointment ended in January 1954. According to official RAAF historian Alan Stephens, McCauley was "just as ready to become CAS in 1952 as he was in 1954", while a contemporary observer declared that "seldom has a better-equipped officer led a branch of the Australian services".<ref name="Dennis"/><ref name="Going Solo pp.41-44"/>  He was the first of four former Duntroon cadets to successively head up the Air Force between 1954 and 1969, followed by Air Marshals [[Frederick Scherger]], [[Valston Hancock]], and [[Alister Murdoch]].<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 320<U+2013>321</ref> 

[[File:MALTA0845McCauley1954.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Air Marshal McCauley (right) as Chief of the Air Staff, visiting No.&nbsp;78 Wing in Malta shortly before its return to Australia, December 1954|alt=Informal half portrait of two men wearing dark military uniforms with peaked caps, in conversation outdoors]]
McCauley was raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1955 [[New Year Honours]].<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=40367|supp=yes|startpage=40|date=31 December 1954|accessdate=on 10 April 2011}}</ref> In October 1956, he gave a presentation on air power concepts that was attended by Prime Minister Menzies, as well as the other Australian service chiefs. McCauley identified Malaya and Indochina, particularly [[Vietnam]], as likely areas for future RAAF deployments, advocating a continued presence in [[Singapore]] in view of its stategic importance to the defence of Australia, as he had witnessed first-hand during World War&nbsp;II. He also recommended that a [[supersonic]] light bomber replace the straight-winged and obsolescent [[English Electric Canberra]], primarily for [[interdiction]] in [[Southeast Asia]].<ref name="Going Solo pp.41-44"/> McCauley's tenure as CAS saw the beginning of a trend for the RAAF to equip with US aircraft types in preference to British types, with recommendations being put forward for the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|F-104 Starfighter]] (though in the event the French [[Dassault Mirage&nbsp;III]] was purchased) and [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]]. This stemmed partly from his inspection of Allied air force units during the [[Korean War]], when he observed that those employing American hardware were far better served with spare parts and replacement aircraft than those with British equipment.<ref name="Going Solo pp.187-190, 243">Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 187<U+2013>190, 243</ref> Some of his senior commanders had urged replacing the Canberra with [[Avro Vulcan]] heavy bombers, but McCauley did not pursue this option, preferring to concentrate in the short term on new fighter technology.<ref>Stephens, ''Power Plus Attitude'' pp. 150<U+2013>151, 162</ref> He also made a point of supporting the Australian aircraft industry wherever feasible.<ref name="Going Solo pp.187-190, 243"/><ref>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 241</ref> 

McCauley instigated the redevelopment of [[RAAF Base Darwin]] in the [[Northern Territory]] as the first stage of a forward defence strategy. He aimed to make Darwin the "main Australian base for war" and a launching point for deployments to Southeast Asia, rather than simply a transit station. Over the next ten years, [[No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron RAAF|No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron]] transformed the base's runways, buildings and other infrastructure into a modern facility capable of handling major operations. This concept was taken another step by McCauley's successor as CAS, Air Marshal Scherger, who conceived a series of front-line [[RAAF Bare Bases|"bare bases"]] across [[Northern Australia]], beginning with plans for [[RAAF Base Tindal]] in 1959.<ref>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 282<U+2013>284</ref> Alan Stephens later described McCauley and Scherger as "among the RAAF's better chiefs".<ref>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 221</ref>
