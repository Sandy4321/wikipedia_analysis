'''St Patrick's Church''' is an [[Anglican]] church in [[Hove]], in the [[England|English]] city of [[Brighton and Hove]].  Situated on a narrow site in Cambridge Road, off Western Road close to the boundary with Brighton, it is still in use as a place of worship, but since 1985 it has also been used as a [[Homeless shelter|night shelter]] for homeless people.  Most of the interior of the building is now dedicated to this role.

==History==
The [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick Estate]] had been developed from 1824 onwards at the eastern edge of Hove, on the border with Brighton, on land originally belonging to Wick Farm.  In 1851, the whole of the Wick Farm estate passed into the control of the Brunswick Square Commissioners.  This land was rapidly developed as a residential area by Baronet Sir [[Isaac Lyon Goldsmid]].<ref name="Dale113">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p113 }}</ref>  St Andrew's Church in Waterloo Street, nominally the church of the Brunswick Estate, was a long way from this new housing and, being used mainly by the aristocratic classes, only had eighty pews which were not subject to pew rental fees.<ref name="Dale68">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Brighton Churches |origdate= |origyear=1989 |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |date= |year= |month= |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |language= |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=p68 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref>  This made it unsuitable for the lower-class, poorer residents of the new development, so an Irish priest, Dr James O'Brien, decided to build another church in the area.  As with several other churches in Brighton and Hove at that time, this was a [[Chapel#Proprietary_chapels|proprietary chapel]] which he owned and ran himself, gaining an income from pew rents, marriage and funeral fees and various other sources.  An [[Act of Parliament]] was normally needed before a proprietary chapel could be built, but none was granted in the case of this church.<ref name="Dale113"/>

Construction started in July 1857 and the church was opened under licence on [[20 October]] [[1858]].  The [[Bishop of Chichester]], Dr [[Ashurst Turner Gilbert]], attended the first service.<ref name="Dale113"/>  In its first few years, the church was known as '''St James' Church'''; it changed to '''St Patrick's and St James<nowiki>'</nowiki>''' in 1865, and finally 
became '''St Patrick's''' in 1868.<ref name="Dale114"/>  The cost of construction was nearly <U+00A3>13,500, although rental income from some of the pews helped to offset this.<ref name="Dale115"/>

The church was given a parish on [[21 August]] [[1885]] by Rev. Ridley Daniel-Tyssen, one of the O'Briens' seven nephews, who took control of the church after his uncle's death despite a High Court challenge at the [[Court of Chancery]] from another nephew who contended that he should have inherited the church: Dr O'Brien had not written in his will that Daniel-Tyssen was to receive the church and the curacy, and his wife's will incorrectly stated that he had.  The Bishop of Chichester had been called as a witness.<ref name="Dale116"/><ref name="Dale117"/>  In the late 20th century the parish was amalgamated with that of St Andrew's Church on Waterloo Street,<ref name="Dale118">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p118 }}</ref> which was closed and declared redundant in 1990.<ref name="Dale70">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p70 }}</ref>  It now [http://www.achurchnearyou.com/parish.php?p=10/93 covers] the area between Holland Road, Lansdowne Road, the Brighton/Hove boundary and the seafront.<ref name="acnyStP">{{cite web|title=Hove, St Patrick, Diocese of Chichester|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/parish.php?p=10/93|accessdate=2008-05-17|publisher=A Church Near You|year=2008|work=A Church Near You website}}</ref>

==Architecture==
Only the eastern side of the church is visible from the road.<ref name="Dale115">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p115 }}</ref>  The architect was Henry Edward Kendall junior, who had designed the Sussex County Lunatic Asylum (later St Francis Hospital) in [[Haywards Heath]] and worked on the [[Knebworth]] estate inherited by the novelist [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Edward Bulwer-Lytton]].<ref name="Dale114">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p114 }}</ref>  Kendall adopted the [[Early English Period#Early English period|Early English Gothic]] style and used [[Rag-stone|Kentish ragstone]] with stone dressings and a [[slate]] roof.  An octagonal tower was started but never completed, leaving a stump in one corner.  The interior consists of a [[chancel]], side chapels, an aisled nave and a [[narthex]] to the south.  The chancel, which features [[stencilling]] and paintings from the 1890s, is topped by a [[hammerbeam roof]], and the roof of the nave has gabled [[clerestory]] windows.<ref name="Dale114"/><ref name="IoEStPatrick">{{cite web|title=Images of England <U+2014> detailed record, Church of St Patrick and wall fronting road, Cambridge Road (west side), Hove|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=365505&mode=quick|work=[[Images of England]]|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|year=2007|accessdate=2008-05-17}}</ref>  An [[Organ (music)|organ]] built by [[Henry Willis & Sons]] was installed in 1865, but was moved from one of the side chapels to the wall of the tower about 40 years later.<ref name="Dale115"/>

Several distinguished architects provided internal fittings at St Patrick's.<ref name="Dale117">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p117 }}</ref>  [[William Butterfield]] designed the north window as a "memorial" to Dr O'Brien and his wife Octavia, who were still alive at the time (they both died in 1884, 14 years after the window was installed), another window on the northeastern side, and the [[lectern]], cast in brass and featuring an eagle and St Patrick.<ref name="Dale116">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p116 }}</ref>  This dates from 1873.<ref name="IoEStPatrick"/>  A red [[sandstone]] [[reredos]] of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] was presented by [[Somers Clarke]] in 1887.  [[Sir George Gilbert Scott]] designed the [[pulpit]].<ref name="Dale117"/><ref name="IoEStPatrick"/>  Other features include several stained glass windows, a [[Baptismal font|font]] of [[alabaster]], a set of [[Stations of the Cross]] in the form of framed [[oil painting]]s, [[fresco]]es in memory of Octavia O'Brien and a memorial tablet for Rev. Daniel-Tyssen.<ref name="Dale116"/><ref name="Dale117"/><ref name="IoEStPatrick"/>  Both he and his uncle were buried at [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church]], Hove's parish church.<ref name="Dale117"/>

The church received criticism in its early years for its appearance and for the nature of its services.  [[Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel]] dismissed it as "spacious without grandeur and ornate without grace"; the early interior decorations and fixtures were described as "primitive"; and although there is now a large array of [[stained glass]],<ref name="IoEStPatrick"/> it was all installed some time after the church opened.<ref name="Dale115"/>  More controversially, Dr O'Brien<U+2014>who had named himself perpetual curate of the church<U+2014>had a strong interest in the use of music in Christian worship, and St Patrick's was unrivalled in Brighton or Hove for several decades for its music and the size of its choir.  However, in the towns at that time there were many opponents of such "[[High Church]]" practices,<ref name="Dale145">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p145 }}</ref> and the church received the mocking nickname "Paddy's Music Hall".<ref name="Dale115"/><ref name="IoEStPatrick"/>

==The church today==
Although the church was built to hold several hundred people, the congregation had declined to around 20 by 1985.  One night in the winter of that year, the vicar, Rev. Alan Sharpe, allowed two homeless people to sleep on the floor of the church after they went to the vicarage.  This continued, and more homeless people were encouraged to stay overnight.  In 1987 the narthex was converted into a dedicated [[Homeless shelter|night shelter]].  Soon afterwards a charity was formed to raise money to develop the shelter further, in particular by redeveloping the interior of the church to dedicate more space to homeless people.<ref name="BHCC">{{cite web|title=Brighton & Hove Education Online: Christian places of worship|url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1001437|accessdate=2008-05-17|publisher=Brighton & Hove City Council|year=2003|work=Brighton & Hove Education Online website}}</ref>  The Lorica Trust was set up for this purpose; it now consists of three divisions, offering night shelter and hostel accommodation to homeless people; providing services to people with learning disabilities in [[East Sussex]], [[West Sussex]] and [[Surrey]]; and operating church-based community projects and helping churches work together with their local communities.<ref name="LoricaMain">{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Lorica Trust|url=http://www.lorica.org.uk/index.htm|accessdate=2008-05-17|publisher=Lorica Trust|year=2006|work=Lorica Trust website}}</ref>

The shelter was extended to 12 beds in 1993 and 22 beds in 1999, when it moved to the northern part of the church.<ref name="LoricaShelter">{{cite web|title=Lorica St Patrick's: Nightshelter|url=http://www.lorica.org.uk/st_patricks_what_we_do_nightshelter.htm|accessdate=2008-05-17|publisher=Lorica Trust|year=2006|work=Lorica Trust website}}</ref>  As a result, only a small part of the church is now used for worship: chairs are arranged in a circle around the altar, and the night shelter overlooks it, forming an integral part of the church (although it has a separate entrance).<ref name="IoEStPatrick"/><ref name="BHCC"/>  As well as offering overnight accommodation for regular use and in emergencies, the shelter is open in the morning and evening to offer advice, social activities, meals and similar.  The church itself holds a service every day, and a special service and social event on [[St Patrick's Day]].<ref name="BHCC"/>

Residents and volunteers have worked together with design firms to create a new form of self-contained sleeping unit called a "MiPod".  It has similarities to the 1970s "sleep capsule" or [[capsule hotel]] concept.<ref name="LoricaMiPod">{{cite web|title=Lorica St Patrick's: MiPods|url=http://www.lorica.org.uk/feature_mipod.htm|accessdate=2008-05-17|publisher=Lorica Trust|year=2006|work=Lorica Trust website}}</ref>  Six have been installed, and another 20 are planned.<ref name="LoricaFuture">{{cite web|title=Lorica St Patrick's: Our Future Vision|url=http://www.lorica.org.uk/st_patricks_what_we_do_future_vision.htm|accessdate=2008-05-17|publisher=Lorica Trust|year=2006|work=Lorica Trust website}}</ref>
