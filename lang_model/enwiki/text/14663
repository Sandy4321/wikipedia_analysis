}}
'''The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man''' is a [[Motion simulator|motion-based]] [[3D film|3D]] [[dark ride]] located at the [[Islands of Adventure]] and [[Universal Studios Japan]] [[theme park]]s. Built for Islands of Adventure's opening in 1999, the attraction is a hybrid ride combining special roving motion vehicles with [[3D computer graphics|3D]] projection, elaborate physical sets, and both practical and tactile effects.

The ride takes park guests-turned-last-minute-reporters into the world of [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Spider-Man]], and after boarding a ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' vehicle known as the "Scoop", the rider learns that the evil [[Sinister Syndicate]] has captured the [[Statue of Liberty]] with an [[anti-gravity]] gun. This evil group is made up of many famous Spider-Man villains, including [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Scream (comics)|Scream]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Hydro-Man]], and the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]].

The attraction took three years to produce, with many new technologies and techniques being developed. ''The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man'' has been well received, winning several awards including the [[Golden Ticket Award]] for Best Dark Ride for twelve consecutive years.

Guests enter the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' from [[Islands of Adventure#Marvel Super Hero Island|Marvel Super Hero Island]] at Islands of Adventure or [[Universal Studios Japan#New York|New York]] at Universal Studios Japan.<ref name="Parkz USJ" /> Guests are shown a video in which the company's good reputation is touted and a new newsgathering vehicle, the "Scoop", is introduced. After walking though the empty office, guests are shown a "live" video feed of news coverage. [[Sinister Syndicate|Five supervillains]] led by [[Doctor Octopus]] have lain siege to the city by an experimental anti-gravity cannon created by Doctor Octopus himself. The syndicate steals the [[Statue of Liberty]] and threatens to destroy it if the city does not surrender to them. As guests walk through the empty offices of the ''Bugle'', it becomes apparent that all the reporters have fled, leaving The Bugle's Editor-in-Chief [[J. Jonah Jameson]] with no choice but to send the tourists to cover the story using the Bugle's new Scoop vehicle.<ref name="Super Hero Island is Marvel">{{cite journal|title=Super Hero Island is Marvel|journal=Amusement Business|date=April 5, 1999|volume=111|issue=14|pages=18<U+2013>19}}</ref><ref name=Queue>{{cite web|title=The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man full queue cartoon|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3uIwb-Uoas|publisher=YouTube|date=June 30, 2012|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref>

The ride system used on ''The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man'' was originally prototyped for the attraction at Islands of Adventure, before being installed at Universal Studios Japan.

===Ride film and projections===
''The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man'' was primarily developed by Universal Creative, the research and development division of [[Universal Parks & Resorts]]. [[Scott Trowbridge]], who now works for [[Walt Disney Imagineering]],<ref name="Trowbridge joins Walt Disney Imagineering">{{cite news|last=Powers|first=Scott|title=Trowbridge joins Walt Disney Imagineering|url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/business_tourism_aviation/2007/10/trowbridge-join.html|accessdate=June 23, 2013|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=October 22, 2007|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121106111354/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/business_tourism_aviation/2007/10/trowbridge-join.html|archivedate=November 6, 2011}}</ref> was the ride's producer and director.<ref name="Web Masters" /> [[Thierry Coup]], who has since worked on [[Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey]] and [[Transformers: The Ride]],<ref name="Getting to know: Thierry Coup">{{cite web|title=Getting to know: Thierry Coup|url=http://tftheride.rwsentosablog.com/2011/10/05/getting-to-know-thierry-coup/|publisher=Resorts World Sentosa|accessdate=June 23, 2013|work=Universal Studios Singapore|date=October 5, 2011}}</ref> was the production designer.<ref name="Web Masters" /> Trowbridge and Coup helped develop the initial storyboards for the attraction.<ref name="Extreme Rides" /> They travelled to Massachusetts several times to meet with Jeff Kleiser and Diana Walczak of the Kleiser-Walczak Construction Company (later Synthespian Studios) who provided animation direction.<ref name="Web Masters" /> Coup produced the film alongside [[Patrick Mooney (producer)|Patrick Mooney]] and [[Mark Rhodes (producer)|Mark Rhodes]]. Trowbridge is given writing credits alongside [[Ross Osterman]] and [[Scott Peterson (comics)|Scott Peterson]]. Peter Lehman provided the soundtrack with [[Soundelux]].<ref name="Web Masters" />

The attraction features thirteen {{Convert|30|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} projection screens, twelve of which use 3D projection.<ref name="Web Masters">{{cite web|first=David|last=Johnson|title=Web Masters|url=http://livedesignonline.com/mag/show_business_web_masters/index.html|accessdate=September 14, 2009|date=November 1, 1999}}</ref><ref name="Kleiser-Walczak">{{cite AV media|title=The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man: Documentary|publisher=Kleiser-Walczak Construction Company|year=1999|location=[[Orlando, Florida]]}}</ref> The ride uses a [[polarized 3D system]] where the two projectors have [[Photographic filter#Polarizer|polarizers]] designed to interact with each lens of the 3D glasses.<ref name="<U+2018>Spider-Man<U+2019> ride reopens at Universal Orlando with high-flying, high-definition enhancements">{{cite web|last=Brigante|first=Ricky|title=<U+2018>Spider-Man<U+2019> ride reopens at Universal Orlando with high-flying, high-definition enhancements|url=http://www.insidethemagic.net/2012/03/spider-man-ride-reopens-at-universal-orlando-with-high-flying-high-definition-enhancements/|publisher=Inside the Magic|accessdate=July 2, 2013|date=March 8, 2012}}</ref> By blocking light from one projector with each lens, the 3D effect is achieved. With traditional 3D projections there is an ideal seating location, where an off-center viewing location reduces the overall effect of the 3D. To allow the ride to effectively combine 3D projections with moving viewers, a process called squinching was developed. First, the amount of distortion is predicted from a particular viewing angle. This same amount of distortion is then added in the opposite direction in order to counteract the effects. Initially miniature models were used to determine the ride's path and the vehicle's point of view, with full-scale prototypes being used later.<ref name="Extreme Rides" /> Trowbridge and Coup are credited with inventing the concept of squinching, with Universal Studios holding a patent for the method.<ref name="Patent squinching">{{cite patent|country=US|number=6462769|status=patent|title=Image correction method to compensate for point of view image distortion|gdate=October 8, 2002|fdate=October 16, 2000|invent1=Trowbridge, Scott|invent2=Coup, Thierry J.|assign1=[[Universal Studios]]}}</ref>

===Special effects===
In addition to the ride's motion base and 3D projections, special effects including [[fog machine]]s, [[fire]] and [[laser]]s are also employed throughout the attraction. All of these effects, along with the ride system, 3D projections and soundtrack, are controlled by a central computer which knows, to one thirtieth of a second, when they are to execute.<ref name="Extreme Rides" /> Just shy of the ride's debut, the director of show and ride engineering at Islands of Adventure, Steve Blum, described ''The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man'' as the "most technically complex of all of the attractions" at the park. Vice president of design and creative development Mark Woodbury stated that they "would not have been able to tell this particular story if it weren't for the technical tools".<ref name="Technology Just Part Of The Story">{{cite journal|last=O'Brien|first=Tim|title=Technology Just Part Of The Story|journal=Amusement Business|date=April 26, 1999|volume=111|issue=17|pages=38<U+2013>39}}</ref>
