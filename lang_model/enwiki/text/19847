{{Apartheid}}
'''Pieter Willem Botha''' ([[January 12]] [[1916]] <U+2013> [[October 31]] [[2006]]), commonly known as '''"P. W."''' and ''Die Groot Krokodil'' ([[Afrikaans]] for "The Big Crocodile"), was the [[Prime Minister of South Africa|prime minister]] of [[South Africa]] from 1978 to 1984 and the first executive [[State President of South Africa|state president]] from 1984 to 1989. Botha was a long-time leader of [[South Africa]]'s [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] and a staunch advocate of racial segregation and the [[apartheid]] system. While in power he made some small concessions towards human rights, but he always refused to apologize for apartheid. He refused to testify at the new government's [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] and was fined and given a suspended jail sentence for his refusal to testify in relation to human rights violations. 

He was not related to contemporary National Party politician [[Pik Botha|Roelof Frederik "Pik" Botha]], who served as his foreign minister.

==Early life==
Botha was born on the farm Telegraaf in the [[Paul Roux]] district of the [[Orange Free State]], the son of [[Afrikaner]] parents. His father, also named Pieter, fought as a [[commando]] against the British in the [[Second Boer War]] (1899<U+2013>1902). During the war his mother was interned in a British [[concentration camp]]. He initially attended the [[Paul Roux]] School and matriculated from [[Voortrekker]] Secondary School [[Bethlehem, South Africa]]. In 1934, P.W. Botha entered the Grey University College (now the [[University of the Free State]]) in [[Bloemfontein]] to study [[law]], but left early at the age of 20 in order to pursue a career in politics. He began working for the National Party as a political organiser in the neighbouring [[Cape Province]]. 

In the years leading to [[World War II]], Botha sympathised with the [[Germany|German]] [[Nazi Party]] and joined the right-wing [[Afrikaner nationalism|Afrikaner nationalists]] in the [[Ossewabrandwag]], or Oxwagon Sentinel (OB). However in later years, with Allied victory looming in Europe, Botha was critical of the national socialist movement, favouring [[Christianity|Christian]] nationalism instead, and condemned the Ossewabrandwag, charging it with "interference" in national politics <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/01/world/africa/01botha.html P. W. Botha, Defender of Apartheid, Is Dead at 90], ''New York Times'', 1 November, 2006</ref>

In 1943, Botha married Anna Elizabeth Rossouw (Elize), and the couple had two sons and three daughters.

==Parliamentary career==
Botha was first elected to [[Parliament of South Africa|national parliament]] from the town of [[George, Western Cape|George]] in the Southern cape, as a member of the National Party in 1948 at the beginning of the party's more than four decade tenure in power. In [[1958]] Botha was appointed Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs by [[Hendrik Verwoerd]]. He was appointed [[defence minister]] by Prime Minister [[B.J. Vorster]] in 1966. When Vorster resigned in 1978, Botha was elected as his successor by parliament.

Though generally considered a conservative, Botha was also seen as far more pragmatic than his predecessor. He was keen to promote constitutional reform, and hoped to implement a form of [[Federation|federal]] system in South Africa that would allow for greater "self-rule" for black [[homeland]]s (or [[Bantustan]]s), while still retaining the supremacy of a white central government. 

On becoming prime minister, Botha initially retained the defence portfolio until October 1980, when he appointed chief of the [[South African Defence Force]], General [[Magnus Malan]], as defence minister. Botha pursued an ambitious military policy designed to increase South Africa's military capability. He sought to improve relations with the West &ndash; especially the United States &ndash; but with mixed results. He argued that the preservation of the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid]] government, though unpopular, was crucial to stemming the tide of African [[communism]], which had made in-roads into neighbouring [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] after these two former [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonies]] obtained independence.

In the 1980s he began a [[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction|secret nuclear weapons program]] in collaboration with [[Israel]], which culminated in the production of six [[nuclear bomb]]s. He also remained steadfast in South Africa's administration of the neighbouring territory [[South-West Africa]], particularly while there was a presence of [[Cuba]]n troops in Angola to the north. Botha was responsible for introducing the notorious police counter-insurgency unit, [[Koevoet]]. South African intervention in support of the rebel [[UNITA]] movement in the [[Angolan Civil War]] continued until the late 1980s and was dependent upon the withdrawal of Cuban troops. To maintain the nation's military strength, a very strict [[conscription|draft]] was implemented to enforce compulsory military service for white South African men.

==State President==

In 1983 Botha proposed a new [[Constitution of South Africa#Previous constitutions of South Africa|constitution]], which was then put to a vote of the white population. Though it did not implement a federal system, it created two new houses of parliament, one for [[Coloured]]s (House of Representatives) and one for [[Asians in South Africa|Indians]] (House of Delegates), along with that for whites-only (House of Assembly). The new [[Tricameral Parliament]] theoretically had equal legislative powers but the laws each new house passed were effective solely in its own community. Control of the country was maintained by the white house. The plan included no chamber or system of representation for the black majority. 

The new constitution also changed the [[executive branch]], abolishing the post of prime minister. Instead, the role of [[head of government]] would be combined with that of [[head of state]] to create a strong, executive presidency with expanded powers. The presidency and cabinet had sole jurisdiction over areas deemed to be of "national" responsibility, such as foreign policy and race relations. Though the new constitution was criticised by the black majority for failing to grant them any formal role in government, many international commentators praised it as a "first step" in what was assumed to be a series of reforms. In 1984, Botha was elected as the first [[State President of South Africa|state president of South Africa]] under the newly approved constitution. 

Implementing the presidential system was seen as a key step in consolidating Botha's personal power. In previous years he had succeeded in getting a number of strict laws that limited [[freedom of speech]] through parliament, and thus suppressed criticism of government decisions.  

Botha's authoritarian style of leadership made him unpopular in certain western countries, and many condemned him as a harsh, racist [[dictator]]. In many western countries, such as the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] (where the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] was based) and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] there was much debate over the imposition of [[economic sanctions]] in order to weaken Botha and undermine the white-minority regime. By the late 1980s &ndash; as foreign investment in South Africa declined &ndash; disinvestment began to have a serious effect on the nation's economy.

==Apartheid regime==
In some ways, Botha's application of the apartheid system was less repressive than that of his predecessors: [[interracial marriage]] &ndash; which had been banned &ndash; was legalised, and the constitutional prohibition on multiracial political parties was lifted. He also relaxed the [[Group Areas Act]], which barred non-whites from living in certain areas. In 1983, constitutional reforms granted limited political rights to [[Coloureds]] (South Africans of mixed white and non-white ancestry) and [[India]]ns. Late in his term, he became the first South African government leader to authorise contacts with imprisoned ANC leader [[Nelson Mandela]]. However, on the central issue of granting political rights to blacks and ending white supremacy, he would not budge. In the face of rising discontent and violence, he imposed greater state repression such as states of emergency and state-sponsored covert action against anti-apartheid activists. He also steadfastly refused to negotiate with the [[African National Congress]].

Typical of his rule was his 1985 [["Crossing the Rubicon" speech]], a policy address in which Botha was widely expected to announce new reforms. Instead, he refused to give in to pressure for concessions to the black majority including the release of Nelson Mandela. His defiance of international opinion in this intransigent speech led immediately to further isolation of the country, calls for economic sanctions to be applied and a rapid decline in the value of the [[South African rand|rand]]. The following year, Botha declared a nation-wide [[state of emergency]].

Thousands were detained without trial during his presidency, while others were tortured and killed. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission found him responsible for gross violations of human rights<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,1936843,00.html]Dan van der Vat. ''Guardian'' Obituary. November 2, 2006.</ref>. It also found that he had directly authorised 'unlawful activity which included killing.'<ref>[http://www.info.gov.za/otherdocs/2003/trc/3_1.pdf]Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa. (2003) ''Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa Report'', Vol. 6, Section 3, pp. 252-3, para. 326 (e), 327, and 328.</ref> However, he refused to apologise for apartheid. In an interview to mark his 90th birthday he suggested that he had no regrets about the way he ran the country.<ref>[http://www.mweb.co.za/home/?p=portalfeatures&i=58414 The Groot Krokodil speaks], ''MWeb'', 2 November, 2006</ref>  He denied, however, that he had ever considered Black South Africans to be in any way inferior to whites, but conceded that "some" whites did hold that view.  He also claimed that the apartheid policies were inherited from the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[British Empire|colonial]] administration in the Eastern Cape and Natal Province, implying that he considered them something he and his government had followed by default.

==Botha's downfall==
President Botha's downfall can be directly attributed to decisions taken at the [[Ronald Reagan]]/[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] summit of the leaders of the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Moscow]] (May 29 - June 1, 1988) that paved the way to resolving the problem of [[Namibia]] which, according to foreign minister [[Pik Botha]], was destabilising the region and "seriously complicating" the major issue which South Africa itself would shortly have to face.<ref>[http://www.klausdierks.com/Chronology/130.htm Chronology of Namibian independence]</ref> Soviet military aid would cease and [[Cuba]]n troops be withdrawn from [[Angola]] as soon as South Africa complied with [[UNSCR|UN Security Council Resolution 435]] by relinquishing control of Namibia and allowing UN-supervised elections there. The [[New York Accords]], which gave effect to the Reagan/Gorbachev summit decisions, were signed at [[United Nations|UN headquarters]] in [[New York]] on [[December 22]], [[1988]] by representatives of Angola, Cuba and South Africa.<ref>[http://www.usip.org/library/pa/angola/angola_cuba_sa_12221988.html New York Accords signed by Angola, Cuba and South Africa]</ref>

On [[January 18]], [[1989]], Botha (then aged 73) suffered a mild stroke which prevented him from attending a meeting with Namibian political leaders on [[January 20]], [[1989]]. Botha's place was taken by acting president, J. Christiaan Heunis.<ref>''[[The New York Times]]'' [[January 22]], [[1989]] "Botha suffers mild stroke"</ref> On [[February 2]], [[1989]], Botha resigned as leader of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] (NP) anticipating his nominee - finance minister Barend du Plessis - would succeed him. Instead, the NP's parliamentary caucus selected as leader education minister [[Frederik Willem de Klerk|F W de Klerk]], who moved quickly to consolidate his position within the party. In March 1989, the NP elected de Klerk as state president but Botha refused to resign, saying in a television address that the constitution entitled him to remain in office until March 1990 and that he was even considering running for another five-year term. Following a series of acrimonious meetings in [[Cape Town]], and five days after UNSCR 435 was implemented in Namibia on [[April 1]], [[1989]], Botha and de Klerk reached a compromise: Botha would retire after the parliamentary elections in September, allowing de Klerk to take over as president.

However, Botha resigned from the presidency abruptly on [[August 14]], [[1989]] complaining that he had not been consulted by de Klerk over his scheduled visit to see president [[Kenneth Kaunda]] of [[Zambia]]:
:"The ANC is enjoying the protection of president Kaunda and is planning insurgency activities against South Africa from [[Lusaka]]," Botha declared on nationwide television. He said he had asked the cabinet what reason he should give the public for abruptly leaving office. "They replied I could use my health as an excuse. To this, I replied that I am not prepared to leave on a lie. It is evident to me that after all these years of my best efforts for the National Party and for the government of this country, as well as the security of our country, I am being ignored by ministers serving in my cabinet."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/s_africa/stories/botha0889.htm Botha Quits, Criticizes Successor]</ref> 

De Klerk was sworn in as acting president on [[August 15]], [[1989]] and the following month was nominated by the electoral college to succeed Botha in a five-year term as state president.<ref>[http://www.country-studies.com/south-africa/limited-reforms.html South Africa Limited Reforms]</ref> Within months of the collapse of the [[Berlin Wall]], de Klerk had announced the legalisation of anti-apartheid groups &ndash; including the [[African National Congress]] &ndash; and the release of [[Nelson Mandela]]. De Klerk's rule saw the dismantling of the apartheid system and negotiations that eventually led to South Africa's first racially inclusive democratic elections on [[April 27]] [[1994]].

In a statement on the death of former president P W Botha in 2006, de Klerk said:
:"Personally, my relationship with P W Botha was often strained. I did not like his overbearing leadership style and was opposed to the intrusion of the [[State Security Council]] system into virtually every facet of government. After I became leader of the National Party in February 1989 I did my best to ensure that P W Botha would be able to end his term as president with full dignity and decorum. Unfortunately, this was not to be."<ref>[http://www.fwdklerk.org.za/news.php Statement by F W de Klerk on the death of former president P W Botha (Issued by the F W de Klerk Foundation, Cape Town, 1 November 2006)]</ref>

==Retirement==
Botha and his wife Elize retired to their home, ''Die Anker'', in the town of [[Wilderness, Western Cape|Wilderness]], close to the city of [[George, Western Cape|George]] and located on the Indian Ocean coast of the [[Western Cape]]. His wife Elize died in 1997, and he later married [[Barbara Robertson]] on [[June 22]] [[1998]].

Botha remained largely out of sight of the media and it was widely believed that he remained opposed to many of F W de Klerk's reforms. 

Botha refused to testify at the new government's [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] for exposing apartheid-era crimes, which was chaired by his cultural and political nemesis, Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]].  The commission found that he had ordered the bombing of the [[South African Council of Churches]] headquarters in Johannesburg. In August 1998 he was fined and given a suspended jail sentence for his refusal to testify in relation to human rights violations and the violence sanctioned by the [[State Security Council]] (SSC) which he, as president until 1989, had directed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1998/10/98/truth_and_reconciliation/203927.stm TRC findings: P W Botha], ''BBC News'', 29 October, 1998</ref>

==Death==
Botha died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at his home in Wilderness on [[31 October]] [[2006]], aged 90.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6104332.stm Former South Africa leader dies], ''BBC News'', 1 November, 2006</ref>  

His death was met with magnanimity by many of his former opponents. Former President [[Nelson Mandela]] was reported as saying "while to many Mr Botha will remain a symbol of apartheid, we also remember him for the steps he took to pave the way towards the eventual peacefully negotiated settlement in our country."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6105178.stm PW Botha: Reaction in quotes], ''BBC News'', 1 November, 2006</ref>  
President [[Thabo Mbeki]] announced that flags would be flown at half mast, to mark the death of a former head of state.  The offer of a state funeral was declined by Botha's family, and a private funeral was held on [[8 November]] in the town of [[George, Western Cape|George]] where Botha was buried. Mbeki, who has lost a brother, a son and a cousin during apartheid, attended the funeral<ref>[http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_2023965,00.html Flags fly half-mast for PW], ''News24'', 2 November, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=6&art_id=qw1163010962331B215 PW laid to rest], ''Independent Online (IOL)'', 8 November, 2006</ref> and was even seen to shed a tear or two. The following day, pictures of this were splashed on the front pages of most of the regional newspapers.
