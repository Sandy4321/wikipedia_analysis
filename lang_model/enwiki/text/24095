[[Vice Admiral (Australia)|Vice Admiral]] '''Sir Alan Wedel Ramsay McNicoll''' [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Companion of the Order of the Bath|CB]], [[George Medal|GM]] (3 April 1908&nbsp;<U+2013> 11 October 1987) was a senior officer in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) and a diplomat. Born in [[Melbourne]], he entered the [[Royal Australian Naval College]] at the age of thirteen and graduated in 1926. Following training and staff appointments in Australia and the United Kingdom, he was attached to the [[Royal Navy]] at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]]. As torpedo officer of the 1st Submarine [[Flotilla]] in the [[Battle of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean theatre]], McNicoll was decorated with the [[George Medal]] in 1941 for disarming enemy ordnance. He served aboard [[HMS King George V (41)|HMS ''King George V'']] from 1942, sailing in support of several [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] and taking part in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]. McNicoll was posted for staff duties with the [[Admiralty]] from September 1943 and was involved in the planning of the [[Normandy landings]]. He returned to Australia in October 1944.

McNicoll was made [[executive officer]] of [[HMAS Hobart (D63)|HMAS ''Hobart'']] in September 1945. Advanced to [[Captain (naval)|captain]] in 1949, he successively commanded [[HMAS Shoalhaven (K535)|HMAS ''Shoalhaven'']] and [[HMAS Warramunga (I44)|''Warramunga'']] before being transferred to the Navy Office in July 1950. In 1952, McNicoll chaired the planning committee for the [[Operation Hurricane|British nuclear tests]] on the [[Montebello Islands]], and was appointed commanding officer of [[HMAS Australia (D84)|HMAS ''Australia'']]. He commanded the ship for two years before it was sold off for scrap, at which point he returned to London to attend the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]] in 1955. He occupied staff positions in London and [[Canberra]] before being posted to the [[Australian Commonwealth Naval Board|Naval Board]] as Chief of Personnel in 1960. This was followed by a term as [[Commander Australian Fleet|Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet]].

McNicoll's career culminated with his promotion to vice admiral and appointment as [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|First Naval Member and Chief of Naval Staff]] (CNS) in February 1965. As CNS, McNicoll had to cope with significant morale and recruitment issues occasioned by the February 1964 [[Melbourne<U+2013>Voyager collision|collision between HMAS ''Melbourne'' and ''Voyager'']] and, furthermore, oversaw an extensive modernisation of the Australian fleet. [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|Knighted]] in 1966, he presided over the RAN contribution to the [[Vietnam War]], and it was during his tenure that the [[Australian White Ensign]] was created. McNicoll retired from the RAN in 1968 and was appointed as the inaugural Australian Ambassador to Turkey. He served in the diplomatic post for five years, then retired to Canberra. McNicoll died in 1987 at the age of 79.

==Second World War==
On 14 September 1939, eleven days after the outbreak of the Second World War, McNicoll was posted to [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']], the [[flagship]] of Admiral [[William Milbourne James|Sir William James]], the [[Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth]]. In April 1940, McNicoll was transferred to the [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Fiji|58|6}} as a member of the ship's commissioning crew.<ref name="ServRec"/> During McNicoll's time aboard the ship, it was severely damaged by a torpedo in operations on 1 September and barely made it back to harbour.<ref name="ADB"/> McNicoll ultimately served on ''Fiji'' for six months before being attached to [[HMS Medway (F25)|HMS ''Medway'']], a [[Submarine tender|submarine depot ship]] stationed at [[Alexandria]], Egypt, in October 1940.

In April 1942, McNicoll transferred to the battleship {{HMS|King George V|41|6}} and served as Squadron Torpedo Officer.<ref name="News"/><ref name="ServRec"/><ref name="Oxford"/> As part of the [[Home Fleet]], ''King George V'' provided support to several [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] throughout the conflict. From April to May 1942, ''King George V'' formed up as a support component to [[Convoy PQ 15]], the first for McNicoll. While sailing in thick fog on 1 May, ''King George V'' collided with the destroyer {{HMS|Punjabi|F21|6}} after the latter crossed under the bow of the battleship. The ''Punjabi'' was sliced in two during the collision, and sank with heavy loss of life. Several [[depth charge]]s were also ignited on the damaged stern of ''King George V'' during the accident. ''King George V'' was patched up at Seidisfjord, before sailing to [[Gladstone Dock]], Liverpool, to receive repairs.<ref name="KGV">{{cite web|url=http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-01BB-KGV.htm|title=HMS King George V|accessdate=4 May 2013|work=Service Histories of Royal Navy Warships in World War II|publisher=Naval History}}</ref>

In December 1942, HMS ''King George V'' deployed in support of Convoy JW 51A, the first Russian convoy to sail direct from the United Kingdom without stopping at Iceland. The journey was completed without incident. On receiving word of the German naval attack on Convoy JW 51B in what became known as the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]], ''King George V'' was dispatched along with nine other ships from [[Scapa Flow]] on 31 December to provide cover for the returning Convoy RA 51 and to attempt to catch the German ships engaged in the previous assault. The German ships were ultimately not encountered, and RA 51 was returned safely.<ref name="KGV"/> ''King George V'' later provided a covering force for two further convoys during early 1943, before being transferred to the Mediterranean during May in preparation for Operation Husky, the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]].<ref name="KGV"/> Promoted to [[commander]] on 30 June 1943,<ref name="ServRec"/> McNicoll took part in the Sicilian invasion the following month, with ''King George V'' serving as part of the covering force. Prior to the invasion, ''King George V'', along with [[HMS Howe (32)|HMS ''Howe'']], had executed a bombardment of [[Trapani]] and the islands of [[Favignana]] and [[Levanzo]] on the night of 11/12 July, as part of a deception suggesting landings on the west coast of Sicily.<ref name="KGV"/>

McNicoll was briefly reposted to HMS ''Victory'' on 1 September 1943, before being transferred for staff duties with the [[Admiralty]] in London the following month.

==Senior command==
===Ships' captain===
McNicoll was appointed [[executive officer]] of the light cruiser {{HMAS|Hobart|D63|6}} on 16 September 1945, a fortnight after the cessation of hostilities in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]].<ref name="News"/><ref name="ServRec"/> From November 1945 until July 1947, ''Hobart'' spent nine months operating in Japanese waters over three distinct periods as part of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]]. The ship was placed in reserve from December 1947,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-hobart-i|title=HMAS Hobart (I)|accessdate=4 May 2013|work=Ship Histories|publisher=Royal Australian Navy}}</ref> and McNicoll briefly transferred to HMAS ''Penguin'' before assuming the post of Director of Plans and Operations at the Navy Office in Melbourne on 6 January 1948.<ref name="News"/><ref name="ServRec"/><ref name="Oxford"/> Advanced to [[Captain (naval)|captain]] in June 1949, he was posted two months later to {{HMAS|Shoalhaven|K535|6}}, a [[River-class frigate|''River''-class frigate]], as the ship's commanding officer, and was simultaneously placed in charge of the 1st Frigate Squadron. He was appointed an honorary [[aide-de-camp]] to the [[Governor-General of Australia]] in December for a period of three years. In January 1950, McNicoll transferred to command the [[destroyer]] {{HMAS|Warramunga|I44|6}} and was subsequently made [[Captain (D)]] in control of the 10th&nbsp;Destroyer Squadron.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="News"/><ref name="ServRec"/>

During McNicoll's tenure as commanding officer of ''Warramunga'', the ship operated in Australian waters as part of the [[Australia Station]], sailing to New Zealand for a visit during March 1950.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-warramunga-i|title=HMAS Warramunga (I)|accessdate=4 May 2013|work=Ship Histories|publisher=Royal Australian Navy}}</ref> On the outbreak of the Korean War in June that year, ''Warramunga'' was selected as part of the Australian contribution to the conflict. Moreover, the ship was to be attached to a force of five Royal Navy destroyers led by a captain, making it expedient to have the Australian ship commanded by an officer of lower rank; McNicoll was consequently replaced by Commander [[Otto Becher]] on 28 July.<ref>{{Harvnb|O'Neill|1985|p=420}}</ref> McNicoll was then posted to the Navy Office to assist in the introduction and co-ordination of [[National Service]] in the Australian military in response to the [[National Service Act 1951]].

On 8 January 1960, McNicoll was posted to the [[Australian Commonwealth Naval Board|Naval Board]] in [[Canberra]] as Second Naval Member and Chief of Personnel.<ref name="News"/><ref name="ServRec"/> As noted by historian Ian Pfennigwerth, McNicoll held this position at a time in which recruitment and retention in the Navy particularly lagged behind targets.<ref name="ADB"/> McNicoll was additionally appointed as a trustee of the RAN Relief Trust Fund during this period. Completing his term on the Naval Board, McNicoll was posted as Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet on 8 January 1962 and hoisted his standard aboard {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|6}}, the flagship of the RAN.<ref name="Who"/><ref name="ServRec"/> The Australian government had designated the role of the RAN to be primarily one of anti-submarine warfare, a posture which McNicoll thought unwise. McNicoll argued that surface and air weapons posed a threat equal to that of submarines toward vessels in modern naval warfare. As such, he campaigned for a contemporary aircraft carrier to replace that of HMAS ''Melbourne''. The [[Australian Army|Army]] and [[Royal Australian Air Force|Air Force]] opposed McNicoll's stance, and the government ultimately concluded that there was no strategic requirement for a new carrier in light of agreements contained in the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Grey|1998|pp=17<U+2013>18}}</ref> In any event, McNicoll experienced a particularly demanding tenure as Fleet Commander since the RAN was in the process of a complete overhaul of its [[order of battle]] and, as a consequence, he had to manage the introduction and deployment into service of six [[Ton-class minesweeper]]s acquired from the Royal Navy, along with the first batch of [[Westland Wessex]] helicopters and modernised afloat support capabilities. Furthermore, McNicoll was charged with the responsibility of ensuring Australian naval commitments to the [[Far East Strategic Reserve]] were met.<ref name="ADB"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Frame|2004|pp=221<U+2013>222}}</ref>

McNicoll's two-year term as Fleet Commander concluded on 6 January 1964, at which point he returned to the Naval Board as Fourth Naval Member and Chief of Supply. However, this post proved short-lived with his appointment as Flag Officer-in-Charge East Australia Area, headquartered at the land base [[HMAS Kuttabul (naval base)|HMAS ''Kuttabul'']] in Sydney, from June that year.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="News"/><ref name="ServRec"/> In the 1965 New Year Honours, McNicoll was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]].<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=43530|date=1 January 1965|startpage=37|supp=yes|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref>

===Chief of Naval Staff===
On 24 February 1965, McNicoll was promoted [[Vice admiral (Australia)|vice admiral]] and made [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|Chief of Naval Staff]] (CNS) in succession to Vice Admiral [[Hastings Harrington|Sir Hastings Harrington]].<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="News"/><ref name="ServRec"/> By virtue of this position, McNicoll was head of the Naval Board and the functional commander of the RAN.<ref>{{Harvnb|Horner|2005|p=257}}</ref> McNicoll's term as CNS was characterised by a period of heightened activity for the RAN in light of the Australian commitments to the [[Indonesia<U+2013>Malaysia confrontation|Indonesia<U+2013>Malaysia ''Konfrontasi'']] and the [[Vietnam War]]. He furthermore had to oversee an extensive modernisation of the fleet, with the introduction into service of the [[Perth-class destroyer|''Perth''-class destroyers]], [[Attack-class patrol boat|''Attack''-class patrol boats]], and the initial batch of [[Oberon-class submarine|''Oberon''-class submarines]]. The [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Fleet Air Arm]] was also re-equipped with American fixed wing aircraft.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="Oxford"/> Despite these acquisitions, the RAN possessed a rather thin and limited fleet during this period, which McNicoll blamed on past naval planning. He criticised the lack of foresight in earlier decisions that had led to "inconsistencies and inadequate estimating" in the future needs of the RAN, which had consequently left the fleet outdated and minimal.<ref>{{Harvnb|Grey|1998|p=321}}</ref> In addition to the RAN's materiel issues, McNicoll faced significant problems with morale and recruitment. A series of mishaps and accidents over the previous decade led to what naval historian [[Tom Frame (bishop)|Tom Frame]] termed as "an appreciable erosion of public confidence in the navy's professional standards".<ref>{{Harvnb|Frame|2004|p=222}}</ref> The situation intensified following the February 1964 [[Melbourne<U+2013>Voyager collision|collision between HMAS ''Melbourne'' and ''Voyager'']]. The two subsequent [[Royal Commission]]s into the incident subjected the RAN to unprecedented scrutiny and damaged the public perception of its senior leadership.<ref name="ADB"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Frame|2004|pp=222<U+2013>223}}</ref> McNicoll had to cope with the turmoil occasioned by these events and concerned himself with the restoration of morale in the Navy.<ref name="Oxford"/><ref name="Horner264">{{Harvnb|Horner|2005|p=264}}</ref>

The tenure of Air Chief Marshal [[Frederick Scherger|Sir Frederick Scherger]] as [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee]] was set to expire in May 1966, and a replacement had to be selected from the service chiefs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Horner|2005|p=263}}</ref> The [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]], Lieutenant General [[John Wilton (general)|Sir John Wilton]], had among defence and military circles been assumed to be the natural successor. However, mounting speculation arose from late 1965 over who was to be selected for the position as it became known Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies|Sir Robert Menzies]] preferred McNicoll for the post, as did [[Department of Defence (Australia)#Diarchy|Secretary of the Department of Defence]] Sir Ted Hicks, who thought McNicoll more intelligent and objective than his Army counterpart.<ref>{{Harvnb|Horner|2005|pp=264<U+2013>265}}</ref> McNicoll lobbied ardently for the position, and was supported by his wife, Frances, who actively campaigned on her husband's behalf. By December 1965, Scherger's replacement had still not been decided upon and Menzies chose to delay the decision until the new year. However, Menzies retired in January 1966 and was succeeded by his deputy, [[Harold Holt]]. Holt and the newly appointed [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]], [[Allen Fairhall]], preferred Wilton and ultimately selected him to succeed Scherger.<ref>{{Harvnb|Horner|2005|p=266}}</ref> In any event, McNicoll was knighted as a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1966 New Year Honours for his service as CNS.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=43855|date=1 January 1966|startpage=37|supp=yes|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref>

Five blue stars are positioned on the left in the shape of the Southern Cross, while a large sixth star is under the Union Jack|The White Ensign of the Royal Australian Navy, created in 1966 by the Naval Board under McNicoll]]

McNicoll was eager for a RAN contribution to the Vietnam War and, in July 1966, proposed that the four Australian minesweepers operating out of Singapore be deployed to Vietnamese waters since ''Konfrontasi'' was at an end and the vessels were no longer necessary in that area. The notion was rejected by Fairhall, however, who was conscious of an upcoming election and was adamant that nothing be decided until afterward.<ref>{{Harvnb|Grey|1998|p=78}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Horner|2005|p=274}}</ref> The possibility of a naval contribution to Vietnam was raised again in December, and it was decided that the guided missile destroyer {{HMAS|Hobart|D 39|6}} and a clearance diving team of six personnel be deployed as the Royal Australian Navy Force Vietnam.<ref>{{Harvnb|Horner|2005|p=276}}</ref><ref name="Grey">{{Harvnb|Grey|1998|pp=139<U+2013>140}}</ref> Per an agreement between McNicoll and Admiral [[Roy L. Johnson]], Commander of the [[United States Pacific Fleet]], HMAS ''Hobart'' was to be attached to the [[United States Seventh Fleet]] and conduct shore bombardment operations.<ref name="Grey"/> The deployment of an Australian destroyer to Vietnam became permanent, with the ships operating on a six-month rotation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Frame|2004|p=231}}</ref> To McNicoll's satisfaction, the RAN contribution to the theatre was further bolstered in 1967 with the formation of the RAN Helicopter Flight Vietnam and the dispatch of naval aviators to serve in an Army support role with [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Frame|2004|p=236}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Grey|1998|p=84}}</ref>

The visible legacy of McNicoll's service as CNS is the [[Australian White Ensign]].<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="News"/><ref name="Oxford"/> The British [[White Ensign]] had been flown by Australian vessels since the formation of the RAN in 1911, but the Australian contribution to Vietnam<U+2014>a conflict in which the United Kingdom was not involved<U+2014>served to complicate the situation. Federal politician [[Sam Benson]] questioned the Australian use of the British ensign before parliament in October 1965, and McNicoll later raised the issue with the Naval Board. The Naval Board ultimately decided to recommend to the government that the RAN create its own unique white ensign. A design accompanied the recommendation, which described the ensign as a "white flag with the Union Flag in the upper canton at the hoist with six blue stars positioned as in the Australian flag".<ref name="Ensign">{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/history/traditions/australian-white-ensign|title=Australian White Ensign|accessdate=4 May 2013|work=History of the RAN|publisher=Royal Australian Navy}}</ref> The government approved the proposal, and the Australian White Ensign was formally introduced throughout the RAN on 1 March 1967.<ref name="Ensign"/>

After 46 years of service, McNicoll retired from the RAN on 2 April 1968 and was succeeded by Vice Admiral [[Victor Smith]] as CNS.<ref name="News"/><ref name="ServRec"/> In the lead-up to his retirement, McNicoll completed a farewell tour by visiting several ships and naval establishments throughout Australia. The trip culminated with a two-week visit to Vietnam, and McNicoll was present in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] when the city was attacked by [[Viet Cong]] forces as part of the [[Tet Offensive]].<ref name="News"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vietnamroll.gov.au/VeteranDetails.aspx?VeteranId=1236087|title=McNicoll, Alan Wedel Ramsay|accessdate=4 May 2013|work=Vietnam War Nominal Roll|publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Horner|2005|p=287}}</ref> As a man who "liked action", McNicoll later stated he received a "great thrill" during the assault as he awaited transportation back to Australia.<ref name="News"/>

==Ambassador and later life==
On his retirement from the Navy, McNicoll was appointed by the Australian government as its inaugural ambassador to Turkey.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="Oxford"/><ref>{{cite news|title=New Envoys|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/107056407?searchTerm=McNicoll%20Turkey&searchLimits=|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=8 June 1968|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref> He was able to form amiable relations between the governments of Australia and Turkey, despite the physical and logistic issues associated with the establishment of a new embassy and the lack of knowledge both nations had of one another.<ref name="ADB"/> McNicoll held his diplomatic post in [[Ankara]] for five years, before he returned to Australia in 1973 and retired to Canberra.<ref name="Who"/> A man of "culture and refined literary tastes",<ref name="Horner264"/> McNicoll engaged his passion for the arts during retirement and in 1979 published his translation of ''[[Odes (Horace)|The Odes of Horace]]''.<ref name="Who"/><ref name="ADB"/> He was also a music lover and a keen fly-fisherman.<ref name="Who"/>

Sir Alan McNicoll died on 11 October 1987 at the age of 79.<ref name="ADB"/> Remembered as a "well-informed, hard working and skilled administrator",<ref name="Horner264"/> he was cremated with full naval honours. McNicoll was survived by his wife, and by the children from his first marriage.<ref name="ADB"/>
