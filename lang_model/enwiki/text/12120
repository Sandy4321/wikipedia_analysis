'''Herbert Jefferis Pennock''' (February 10, 1894&nbsp;<U+2013> January 30, 1948) was an American [[professional baseball]] [[pitcher]]. He played in [[Major League Baseball]] from 1912 through 1933. He is best known for his time spent with the star-studded [[New York Yankees|New York Yankee]] teams of the mid to late 1920s and early 1930s. 

[[Connie Mack]] signed Pennock to his [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] in 1912. After using Pennock sparingly, and questioning his competitive drive, Mack sold Pennock to the [[Boston Red Sox]] in 1915. After returning from military service in 1919, Pennock became a regular contributor for the Red Sox. The Yankees acquired Pennock from the Red Sox after the 1922 season, and he served as a key member of the pitching staff as the Yankees won four [[World Series]] championships during his tenure with the team. After retiring as a player, Pennock served as a [[coach (baseball)|coach]] and [[farm system]] director for the Red Sox, and as [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].

Pennock was regarded as one of the greatest left-handed pitchers in baseball history. Mack later called his sale of Pennock to the Red Sox his greatest mistake. Pennock died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] in 1948; later that year, he was posthumously inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]].

==Early life==
Pennock was born on February 10, 1894 in [[Kennett Square, Pennsylvania|Kennett Square]], [[Pennsylvania]]. His father, Theodore Pennock, and mother Mary Louise Pennock ([[Name at birth|n<U+00E9>e]] Sharp) were of [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] and [[Quaker]] descent.<ref name=sabr/> His ancestors came to the United States with [[William Penn]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=imlIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=D1UDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4582,6721972&dq=herb-pennock&hl=en|title=Pennock Greatest in Huggins' Book&mdash;Big Winner for Yanks|first=Harry|last=Grayson|authorlink=Harry Grayson|newspaper=The Evening Independent|page=12|date=June 28, 1943|accessdate=September 12, 2013}}</ref> Herb was the youngest of four children.<ref name=sabr>{{cite web|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/612bb457|title=Herb Pennock|publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]]|work=The Baseball Biography Project|first=Frank|last=Vaccaro|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}</ref>

Pennock attended [[Westtown School]] and Cedarcroft Boarding School, where he played for the baseball team. After struggling as a [[first baseman]], with a weak offensive output and throwing arm that resulted in curved throws, his Cedarcroft coach converted Pennock into a [[pitcher]].<ref name=sabr/>

==Playing career==
===Philadelphia Athletics===
While pitching at Cedarcroft, Pennock threw a [[no-hitter]] to [[catcher]] [[Earle Mack]], the son [[Connie Mack]], manager of the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]], in 1910. Pennock agreed to sign with the Athletics at a later date.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8UsbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=L0sEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2916,2722939&dq=herb-pennock+cedarcroft&hl=en|title=Oh Yeah!|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|first=Red|last=Farrell|page=35|date=March 13, 1930|accessdate=September 12, 2013}}</ref> Mack signed Pennock in 1912 to play for his collegiate team based in [[Atlantic City]]. Pennock's father insisted that he sign under an alias in order to protect his collegiate eligibility. Pennock threw a [[no-hitter]] against a traveling [[Negro league baseball]] team, and Mack promoted him to the Athletics.<ref name=sabr/> Mack intended for Pennock to be one of the prospects who would replace star pitchers [[Eddie Plank]], [[Chief Bender]], and [[Jack Coombs]].<ref name=obit/>

Pennock made his major league debut with the [[1912 Philadelphia Athletics season|Athletics during the 1912 season]] on May 14, allowing one [[hit (baseball)|hit]] in four [[innings pitched]].<ref name=sabr/> He was the youngest person to play in the [[American League]] (AL) that season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1912-other-leaders.shtml |title=1912 American League Awards, All-Stars, & More Leaders |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}</ref> Former major leaguer [[Mike Grady (baseball)|Mike Grady]], a neighbor of Pennock's in Kennett Square, took Pennock under his wing, while Bender taught Pennock to throw a [[screwball]].<ref name=sabr/>

Pennock missed most of the [[1913 Major League Baseball season|1913 season]] with an illness.<ref name=sabr/> In the [[1914 Major League Baseball season|1914 season]], Pennock posted a 11<U+2013>4 [[win-loss record (pitching)|win-loss record]] with a 2.79 [[earned run average]] (ERA) in {{frac|151|2|3}} innings pitched for the Athletics, and pitched three scoreless innings in the [[1914 World Series]], which the Athletics lost to the [[1914 Boston Braves season|Boston Braves]]. Mack let Bender go after the season, naming Pennock his [[Opening Day]] starting pitcher in 1915. On Opening Day, Pennock threw a one-hit [[complete game]] [[shutout]] against the [[1915 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]].<ref name=sabr/> However, as the Athletics struggled, Pennock's nonchalant playing style drew Mack's ire. Concluding that Pennock "lacked ambition", Mack sold Pennock to the Red Sox for the [[waivers (baseball)|waiver price]] of $2,500 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2500|1915}}}} in current dollar terms).<ref name=sabr/><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ub0qMHIYcFEC&pg=PT46&lpg=PT46&dq=herb-pennock+waiver&source=bl&ots=3fsI0uShnq&sig=WwGeD07TQc-KWtdX9jMUV0q35OM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LdqfUpOyCNPIsATYr4HAAw&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=herb-pennock%20waiver&f=false|title=Connie Mack: The Turbulent and Triumphant Years, 1915-1931|first=Norman L.|last=Macht|page=29|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|year=2012|isbn= 9780803240353}}</ref> Mack later regarded this sale as his greatest mistake.<ref name=mistake>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2hMxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rGkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3009,5922677&dq=herb-pennock&hl=en|title=Selling Herb Pennock Mack's "Big mistake": A's Pilot Observes Eighty-First Birthday by Recalling "Boner"|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=13|date=December 24, 1943|accessdate=September 12, 2013}}</ref>

===Boston Red Sox===
With a deep pitching staff in place, the Red Sox loaned Pennock to the [[Providence Grays]] of the [[International League]] in August for the remainder of the [[1915 Major League Baseball season|1915 season]].<ref name=sabr/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DoRRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GWgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2493,1272828&dq=herb-pennock&hl=en|title=Herb Pennock Released|newspaper=The Gazette Times|page=10|date=August 13, 1915|accessdate=September 12, 2013}}</ref> He split the [[1916 Major League Baseball season|1916 season]] between the Red Sox and the [[Buffalo Bisons]], also in the International League.

Pitching in [[minor league baseball]], Pennock began to regain confidence.<ref name=sabr/> However, Boston manager [[Jack Barry (baseball)|Jack Barry]] used Pennock sparingly in the [[1917 Major League Baseball season|1917 season]], and Pennock enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] in 1918.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA071EF73A5B11738DDDAB0A94DB405B888DF1D3|title=Baseball Stars in Navy.&nbsp;<U+2013> Many Strong Teams to Represent Sailors of Nation|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 22, 1918|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}</ref> Pennock pitched for a team fielded by the Navy, defeating a team composed of members of the [[United States Army]] in an exhibition for [[George VI]], the [[King of England]], in [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]].

Pennock received only one start apiece in the months of April and May, as the [[1919 Boston Red Sox season|1919 Red Sox]] relied on [[George Dumont]], [[Bill James (pitcher, born 1887)|Bill James]], and [[Bullet Joe Bush]], leading Pennock to threaten to quit in late-May unless Barrow fulfilled his earlier promise to Pennock. Barrow continued to use Pennock regularly after [[Memorial Day]],<ref name=sabr/> and Pennock finished the season with a 16<U+2013>8 win-loss record and a 2.71 ERA in 219 innings pitched.
