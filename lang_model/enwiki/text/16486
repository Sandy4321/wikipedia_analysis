[[Image:Exp derivative at 0.svg|right|frame|''e'' is the unique number such that the value of the derivative (slope of a [[tangent]] line) of ''f'' (''x'') = ''e<sup>x</sup>'' (blue curve) at the point ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 is exactly 1.  For comparison, functions 2<sup>''x''</sup> (dotted curve) and 4<sup>''x''</sup> (dashed curve) are shown; they are not tangent to the line of slope 1 (red).]]

The [[mathematical constant]] '''''e''''' is the unique [[real number]] such that the value of the [[derivative]] (slope of the [[tangent]] line) of ''f''(''x'') = ''e<sup>x</sup>'' at the point ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 is exactly 1. The function ''e<sup>x</sup>'' so defined is called the [[exponential function]], and its [[Inverse function|inverse]] is the [[natural logarithm]], or logarithm to [[base (mathematics)|base]] ''e''. The number ''e'' is occasionally called '''Euler's number''' after the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[mathematician]] [[Leonhard Euler]], or '''Napier's constant''' in honor of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] mathematician [[John Napier]] who introduced [[logarithm]]s. (''e'' is not to be confused with <U+03B3> <U+2013> the [[Euler<U+2013>Mascheroni constant]], sometimes called simply ''Euler's constant''.) 

The number ''e'' is one of the most important in mathematics,<ref>{{cite book | title = An Introduction to the History of Mathematics | author = Howard Whitley Eves | year = 1969 | publisher = Holt, Rinehart & Winston | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=LIsuAAAAIAAJ&q=%22important+numbers+in+mathematics%22&dq=%22important+numbers+in+mathematics%22&pgis=1 }}</ref> alongside the additive and multiplicative identities [[0 (number)|0]] and [[1 (number)|1]], the [[imaginary unit]] ''i'', and [[pi|&pi;]], the circumference to diameter ratio for any circle in a plane. It has a number of equivalent definitions; some of them are given below. 

Since ''e'' is [[transcendental number|transcendental]], and therefore [[irrational number|irrational]], its value cannot be given exactly as a finite or eventually repeating decimal.  The numerical value of ''e'' truncated to 20 [[decimal|decimal places]] is:

:2.71828 18284 59045 23536...

==History==

The first references to the constant were published in 1618 in the table of an appendix of a work on logarithms by [[John Napier]]. However, this did not contain the constant itself, but simply a list of natural logarithms calculated from the constant. It is assumed that the table was written by [[William Oughtred]]. The "discovery" of the constant itself is credited to [[Jacob Bernoulli]], who attempted to find the value of the following expression (which is in fact ''e''):

: <math>\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n</math>

The first known use of the constant, represented by the letter ''b'', was in correspondence from [[Gottfried Leibniz]] to [[Christiaan Huygens]] in 1690 and 1691. [[Leonhard Euler]] started to use the letter ''e'' for the constant in 1727, and the first use of ''e'' in a publication was Euler's ''Mechanica'' ([[1736]]). While in the subsequent years some researchers used the letter ''c'', ''e'' was more common and eventually became the standard.

The exact reasons for the use of the letter ''e'' are unknown, but it may be because it is the first letter of the word ''[[exponential]]''.  Another possibility is that Euler used it because it was the first [[vowel]] after ''a'', which he was already using for another number, but his reason for using vowels is unknown. It is unlikely that Euler chose the letter because it is his last initial, since he was a very modest man, and tried to give proper credit to the work of others.<ref name="OConnor">O'Connor, J.J., and Roberson, E.F.; ''The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive'': [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/e.html "The number ''e''"]; University of St Andrews Scotland (2001)</ref>

==Applications==
===The compound-interest problem===

[[Jacob Bernoulli]] discovered this constant by studying a question about [[compound interest]].  

One simple example is an account that starts with $1.00 and pays 100% interest per year.  If the interest is credited once, at the end of the year, the value is $2.00; but if the interest is computed and added twice in the year, the $1 is multiplied by 1.5 twice, yielding $1.00&times;1.5<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;$2.25.  Compounding quarterly yields $1.00&times;1.25<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;$2.4414&hellip;, and compounding monthly yields $1.00&times;(1.0833&hellip;)<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;$2.613035&hellip;.

Bernoulli noticed that this sequence approaches a limit for more and smaller compounding intervals.  Compounding weekly yields $2.692597&hellip;, while compounding daily yields $2.714567&hellip;, just two cents more. Using ''n'' as the number of compounding intervals, with interest of 1/''n'' in each interval, the limit for large ''n'' is the number that came to be known as ''e''; with ''continuous'' compounding, the account value will reach $2.7182818&hellip;. More generally, an account that starts at $1, and yields (1+''R'') dollars at simple interest, will yield ''e''<sup>''R''</sup> dollars with continuous compounding.

===Bernoulli trials===
The number ''e'' itself also has applications to [[probability theory]], where it arises in a way not obviously related to exponential growth.  Suppose that a gambler plays a slot machine one million times, [[expectation value|expecting]] to win once.  Then the [[probability]] that the gambler will win nothing at all is (approximately) 1/''e''.

This is an example of a [[Bernoulli trials]] process.  Each time the gambler plays the slots, there is a one in one million chance of winning.  Playing one million times is modelled by the [[binomial distribution]], which is closely related to the [[binomial theorem]].  The probability of winning ''k'' times and losing the remaining times is
:<math>\binom{10^6}{k} \left(10^{-6}\right)^k(1-10^{-6})^{10^6-k}.</math>
In particular, the probability of winning zero times (''k''=0) is
:<math>\left(1-\frac{1}{10^6}\right)^{10^6}.</math>
This is very close to the following limit for 1/''e'':
:<math>\frac{1}{e} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^n.</math>

===Derangements===
Another application of ''e'', also discovered in part by Jacob Bernoulli along with [[Pierre Raymond de Montmort]] is in the problem of [[derangement]]s, also known as the ''hat check problem''.<ref>Grinstead, C.M. and Snell, J.L. [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/book.html ''Introduction to probability theory''] (published online under the [[GFDL]]), p. 85.</ref>  Here ''n'' guests are invited to a party, and at the door each guest checks his hat with the butler who then places them into labelled boxes.  But the butler does not know the name of the guests, and so must put them into boxes selected at random.  The problem of de Montmort is: what is the probability that ''none'' of the hats gets put into the right box.  The answer is:
:<math>p_n = 1-\frac{1}{1!}+\frac{1}{2!}-\frac{1}{3!}+\dots+(-1)^n\frac{1}{n!}.</math>
As the number ''n'' of guests tends to infinity, ''p''<sub>n</sub> approaches 1/''e''.  Furthermore, the number of ways the hats can be placed into the boxes so that none of the hats is in the right box is exactly ''n''!/''e'', rounded to the nearest integer.<ref>Knuth (1997) ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'' Volume I, Addison-Wesley, p. 183.</ref>

==''e'' in calculus==
[[Image:Ln+e.svg|thumb|right|200px|The natural log at e, Ln(e), is equal to 1]]
The principal motivation for introducing the number ''e'', particularly in [[calculus]], is to perform [[derivative (mathematics)|differential]] and [[integral calculus]] with [[exponential function]]s and [[logarithm]]s.<ref>See, for instance, Kline, M. (1998) ''Calculus: An intuitive and physical approach'', Dover, section 12.3 "The Derived Functions of Logarithmic Functions."</ref>  A general exponential function ''y''=''a''<sup>''x''</sup> has derivative given as the [[limit of a function|limit]]:
:<math>\frac{d}{dx}a^x=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{a^{x+h}-a^x}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{a^{x}a^{h}-a^x}{h}=a^x\left(\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{a^h-1}{h}\right).</math>
The limit on the right-hand side is independent of the variable ''x'': it depends only on the base ''a''.  When the base is ''e'', this limit is equal to one, and so ''e'' is symbolically defined by the equation:
:<math>\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x.</math>
As a consequence, the exponential function with base ''e'' is particularly suited to doing calculus.  Choosing ''e'', as opposed to some other number, as the base of the exponential function makes calculations involving the derivative much simpler.

Another motivation comes from considering the base-''a'' [[logarithm]].<ref>This is the approach taken by Klein (1998).</ref>  Considering the definition of the derivative of ''log''<sub>a</sub>''x'' as the limit:
:<math>\frac{d}{dx}\log_a x = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\log_a(x+h)-\log_a(x)}{h}=\frac{1}{x}\left(\lim_{u\to 0}\frac{1}{u}\log_a(1+u)\right).</math>
Once again, there is an undetermined limit which depends only on the base ''a'', and if that base is ''e'', the limit is one.  So symbolically,
:<math>\frac{d}{dx}\log_e x=\frac{1}{x}.</math>
The logarithm in this special base is called the [[natural logarithm]] (often represented as "ln"), and it also behaves well under differentiation since there is no undetermined limit to carry through the calculations.

There are thus two ways in which to select a special number ''a''=''e''.  One way is to set the derivative of the exponential function ''a''<sup>x</sup> to ''a''<sup>x</sup>.  The other way is to set the derivative of the base ''a'' logarithm to 1/''x''.  In each case, one arrives at a convenient choice of base for doing calculus.  In fact, these two ostensibly different bases are actually ''the same'', the number ''e''.

===Alternative characterizations===
[[Image:hyperbola E.svg|thumb|right|The area under the graph ''y''=1/''x'' is equal to 1 over the interval 1 &le; x &le; ''e''.]]
Other characterizations of ''e'' are also possible: one is as the [[limit of a sequence]], another is as the sum of an [[infinite series]], and still others rely on [[integral calculus]].  So far, the following two (equivalent) properties have been introduced:

1. The number ''e'' is the unique positive [[real number]] such that
:<math>\frac{d}{dt}e^t = e^t.</math>

2.  The number ''e'' is the unique positive real number such that
:<math>\frac{d}{dt} \log_e t = \frac{1}{t}.</math>

The following alternative characterizations can also be [[characterizations of the exponential function#Equivalence of the characterizations|proven to be equivalent]]:

3. The number ''e'' is the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] 
:<math>e = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n</math>

4. The number ''e'' is the sum of the [[infinite series]]
:<math>e = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} = \frac{1}{0!} + \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} + \frac{1}{3!} + \frac{1}{4!} + \cdots</math>
where ''n''! is the [[factorial]] of ''n''.

5. The number ''e'' is the unique positive real number such that
:<math>\int_{1}^{e} \frac{1}{t} \, dt = {1}</math> 
(that is, the number ''e'' such that the area under the [[hyperbola]] <math> f(t)=1/t </math> from 1 to ''e'' is equal to 1).

==Properties==
===Calculus===
As in the motivation, the [[exponential function]] ''f''(''x'') = ''e''<sup>''x''</sup> is important in part because it is the unique nontrivial function (up to multiplication by a constant) which is its own [[derivative]], and therefore its own [[antiderivative]] as well:

:<math>\frac{d}{dx}e^x=e^x</math> 

and

:<math>e^x= \int_{-\infty}^x e^t\,dt </math>

::<math>= \int_{-\infty}^0 e^t\,dt + \int_{0}^x e^t\,dt </math>

::<math>\qquad= 1 + \int_{0}^x e^t\,dt</math>

===Exponential-like functions===

The number ''x''=''e'' is where the [[global maximum]] occurs for the function

:<math> f(x) = x^{1 \over x}. </math>

More generally, <math> x=\!\ \sqrt[n]{e} </math> is where the global maximum occurs for the function

:<math> \!\ f(x) = x^{1 \over {x^n}} </math>

The infinite [[tetration]] 

:<math> x^{x^{x^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot}}}}} </math>

converges only if <math>e^{-e} \le x \le e^{1/e}, </math> due to a theorem of [[Leonhard Euler]].

<!--Find a better place for this: -->
''e''<sup>x</sup> is usually defined as

:<math> e^{x} = 1 + {x \over 1!} + {x^{2} \over 2!} + {x^{3} \over 3!} + \cdots</math>

===Number theory===

The real number ''e'' is [[Irrational number|irrational]] (see [[proof that e is irrational]]), and furthermore is [[Transcendental number|transcendental]] ([[Lindemann<U+2013>Weierstrass theorem]]). It was the first number to be proved transcendental without having been specifically constructed for this purpose (compare with [[Liouville number]]).  The proof was given by [[Charles Hermite]] in [[1873]]. It is conjectured to be [[normal number|normal]].

===Complex numbers===

It features in [[Euler's formula]], an important formula related to [[complex numbers]]:

:<math>e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x,\,\!</math> 

The special case with ''x'' = &pi; is known as [[Euler's identity]]: 

:<math>e^{i\pi}+1 =0 .\,\!</math>

Furthermore, using the laws for exponentiation,
:<math>(\cos x + i\sin x)^n = \left(e^{ix}\right)^n = e^{inx} = \cos (nx) + i \sin (nx)</math>
which is [[de Moivre's formula]].

==Representations of ''e''==
{{main|Representations of e}}

The number ''e'' can be represented as a [[real number]] in a variety of ways: as an [[infinite series]], an [[infinite product]], a [[continued fraction]], or a [[limit of a sequence]].  The chief among these representations, particularly in introductory [[calculus]] courses is the limit
:<math>\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n,</math>
given above, as well as the series
:<math>e=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!}</math>
given by evaluating the above power series for ''e''<sup>x</sup> at ''x''=1.

Still other less common representations are also available.  For instance, ''e'' can be represented as an infinite [[simple continued fraction]]:

:<math>e=2+
\cfrac{1}{
 1+\cfrac{1}{
  {\mathbf 2}+\cfrac{1}{
   1+\cfrac{1}{
    1+\cfrac{1}{
     {\mathbf 4}+\cfrac{1}{
      \ddots
     }
    }
   }
  }
 }
}
</math>

Or, in a more compact form {{OEIS|id=A003417}}:

:<math>e = [2; 1, \textbf{2}, 1, 1, \textbf{4}, 1, 1, \textbf{6}, 1, 1, \textbf{8}, 1, \ldots,1, \textbf{2n}, 1,\ldots] \,</math>

Many other series, sequence, continued fraction, and infinte product representations of ''e'' have also been developed.

===Known Digits===

The number of known digits of ''e'' has increased dramatically during the last decades. This is due both to the increase of performance of computers as well as to algorithmic improvements.<ref>Sebah, P. and Gourdon, X.; [http://numbers.computation.free.fr/Constants/E/e.html The constant e and its computation]</ref><ref>Gourdon, X.; [http://numbers.computation.free.fr/Constants/PiProgram/computations.html Reported large computations with PiFast]</ref>

==e in computer culture==
In contemporary [[internet culture]], individuals and organizations frequently pay homage to the number ''e''.

For example, in the [[IPO]] filing for [[Google]], in 2004, rather than a typical round-number amount of money, the company announced its intention to raise $2,718,281,828, which is ''e'' billion [[United States dollar|dollars]] to the nearest dollar. Google was also responsible for a mysterious billboard<ref>{{dlw|http://mattwalsh.com/twiki/pub/Main/GoogleBillboardContestFindingPrimesInE/IMG_0742.JPG}}</ref> that appeared in the heart of [[Silicon Valley]], and later in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]; [[Seattle, Washington]]; and [[Austin, Texas]]. It read ''{first 10-digit prime found in consecutive digits of ''e''}.com''. Solving this problem and visiting the advertised web site led to an even more difficult problem to solve, which in turn leads to [[Google Labs]] where the visitor is invited to submit a resume.<ref>{{cite news|first=Andrea|last=Shea|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3916173|title=Google Entices Job-Searchers with Math Puzzle|work=NPR|accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref> The first 10-digit prime in ''e'' is 7427466391, which starts at the 101st digit.<ref>{{cite web|first=Marcus|last=Kazmierczak|url=http://www.mkaz.com/math/google/|title=Math : Google Labs Problems|publisher=mkaz.com|date=[[2004-07-29]]|accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref> (A random stream of digits has a 98.4% chance of starting a 10-digit prime sooner.)

In another instance, the eminent [[computer scientist]] [[Donald Knuth]] let the version numbers of his program [[METAFONT]] approach e.  The versions are 2, 2.7, 2.71, 2.718, and so forth.
