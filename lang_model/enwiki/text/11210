Augusta converted to [[Christianity]] secretly.  Her father had sent spies to watch over her, and one day, when he discovered her praying, he imprisoned her, and then knocked out all of her teeth.<ref name=Sabine>[[Sabine Baring-Gould]], ''The lives of the saints'', Volume 3 (J. Hodges, 1872), 483.</ref>  Her enraged father then tortured and decapitated her with his sword at Serravalle, a district of the present-day [[Vittorio Veneto]], around 100 AD.<ref name="borrelli"/>  Some sources state that her death took place in the 5th century.<ref name="patrick"/><ref name="patron"/>
