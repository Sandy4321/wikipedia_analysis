He and his family moved to suburban [[Hoover, Alabama|Hoover]] when he was eight years old. His parents divorced when he was eight, and his father Brad, a [[dentist]], and stepmother Linda shared custody until he [[age of majority|became of age]].

Hicks has allowed audience members to record his concerts for personal, non-commercial use, and went so far as to authorize the [[Internet Archive]] to create a section for fans to upload and share their recordings, but it was unclear whether his ''American Idol'' contract would allow this to continue, so the Archive will not accept the upload of concerts recorded after [[January 1]], [[2006]].<ref>[http://www.archive.org/details/TaylorHicks Taylor Hicks collection] at the Internet Archive's live music archive</ref>

Hicks auditioned for ''American Idol'' in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] in September 2005.
