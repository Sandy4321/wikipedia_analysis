'''Heywood''' (pop. 28,000) is a town within the [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale]], in [[Greater Manchester]], England.<ref name="GM Gazetteer">{{citation |url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazframe.htm |title=A select gazetteer of local government areas, Greater Manchester County|publisher=[[Greater Manchester County Record Office]]|accessdate=2008-06-17|date=2003-07-31}}</ref> It lies on the course of the [[Rochdale Canal]], on the south bank the [[River Roch]] and is {{convert|2.4|mi|km|1}} east of [[Bury]], {{convert|3.7|mi|km|1}} west-southwest of [[Rochdale]], and {{convert|7.4|mi|km|1}} north of the city of [[Manchester]]. The town of [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]] lies to the south, whilst to the north is the [[Cheesden Valley]], open [[moorland]], and the [[Pennines]].

[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] a part of [[Lancashire]], Heywood as a settlement is believed to date from [[Anglo-Saxon England]], when the [[Anglo-Saxons]] cleared the densely wooded area, and divided it into heys or fenced clearings.<ref name="Link"/> During the [[Middle Ages]], Heywood formed a [[chapelry]] in the [[Township (England)|township]] of Heap. This chapelry was centred on Heywood Hall, a manor house owned by the Heywood family. Farming was the main industry of this rural area, which in the 15th century "consisted of a few cottages".<ref name="Top of England"/> The local population supplemented their incomes by [[hand-loom]] [[woollen]] weaving in the [[domestic system]].

The [[factory system]] in Heywood can be traced to a [[Cotton mill|spinning mill]] in the late-18th century. Following the introduction of [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]], Heywood developed into populous [[mill town]] and coal mining district. A period of "extraordinary growth of the cotton-trade" in the mid-19th century was so profound in Heywood that the town was granted [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]] in 1881.<ref name="Top of England">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1848|p=501-505.}}</ref> Imports of foreign cotton goods during the mid-20th century began the decline in Heywood's textile and mining industries however.

Economically, Heywood is supported by its position by junction 19 of the [[M62 motorway]], which provides transport links with large distribution parks in the south of the town. Heywood's major landmark is the 1860s-built {{convert|189|ft|m|0|adj=on}} tall Parish Church of St Luke the Evangelist which dominates the town's centre and skyline. Heywood was the birthplace of [[Peter Heywood]], the magistrate who aided the discovery of the [[Gunpowder Plot]]; Heywood Hall was the seat of his family. Heywood has a station on the [[East Lancashire Railway]], a [[heritage railway]] and local tourist attraction.

==History==
Human activity in the area extends back to the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]] and the [[Bronze Age]]; [[artefact]]s from both periods have been discovered.<ref name="brief history">{{cite web |title=A brief history of Heywood |publisher=Heywood.org.uk |url=http://www.heywood.org.uk/history.htm}} Retrieved on 1&nbsp;September 2008.</ref> A Bronze Age [[cairn]] {{convert|0.6|m|ft|0}} high and {{convert|10|m|ft}} in diameter was discovered in the 1960s.

The Heywood family, [[Lord of the Manor|Lords of the Manor]] of Heywood, can be traced back to 1164. In 1286, Adam de Bury "granted land in Heywood, in the parish of Bury county of Lancaster" to the Heywood family. Heywood Hall, the administrative centre of the manor and the seat of the family, was built in the 13th century.<ref name="brief history"/> A member of the family and a resident of Heywood Hall was Peter Heywood, the magistrate within party of men who arrested [[Guy Fawkes]] during his attempt to destroy the [[Houses of Parliament]] in 1605.<ref name="brief history"/> Another member of the family, also called Peter Heywood, was aboard the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|HMS ''Bounty'']] when its crew mutinied in 1789.<ref>{{citation |last=Laughton |first=J. K. |title=Heywood, Peter (1772<U+2013>1831) |series=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=online |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13187 |year=2008 |accessdate=15&nbsp;September 2008}}</ref>

The first spinning-mill built in the town was at Wrigley Brook, later known as Queens Park Road. In 1780, industrialist [[Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet|Sir Robert Peel]] (father of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]]) converted Makin Mill to cotton production.<ref name="brief history"/> The cotton-trade in Heywood grew so that by 1845 there were 36&nbsp;cotton-mills in the town, all with one exception were for the manufacture of heavy cotton goods.  They operated 129,936 spinning machines, 203,066 [[Spinning mule|mule-spindles]], and 5,320 [[looms]]. The mills manufactured 8,506 tons of cotton annually, and consuming 71,101 tons of coal in its mills and in its two paper-mills, there were approximately 7,510 persons employed. 

In 1898 W.R.Lee & Company of "Hooley Bridge", Towel Manufactures began operation as the largest weaving mill in Heywood, employing more than 800 workers and over 1,000 Lancashire and Northrop weaving looms. It is responsible for the trade names Leeona (named after W.R.Lee) and "Chortex" (named after "[[Chorley]] Textiles") brands which were sold worldwide.

In 1905 Plum Mill began operation as the largest [[Spinning mule|mule-spinning]] mill in the world under one roof, however Plum Mill and its sister-mill "Unity Mill" were idled in the 1960s under the [[government]] reorganisation of the cotton industry. The last large weaving mill in the town was J. Smith Hargreaves & Company, towel manufactures; however this too was idled in the 1980s and operations were transferred to W.T.Taylor & Co. Ltd, in [[Horwich]].
[[Image:Mutual Mill - No. 3 mill.jpg|thumb|left|Following the [[Industrial Revolution]], Heywood became a [[mill town]], its landscape dominated by large brick-built [[cotton mill]]s. This one is part of the Grade II listed Mutual Mills complex.]]
Heywood is an archetypal [[mill town]], and following the [[Industrial Revolution]] its main industry was the spinning of cotton. Many of the [[cotton mill]]s have now been demolished, mainly for housing. One of the last mills remaining, though not in production since 1986, has recently been offered for redevelopment as apartments. The "Mutual Mills", a complex of four, are Grade II [[listed building]]s.

The town has a history of [[coal mining]]. Coal pits were opened in Hooley Clough in the town in the early 1800s by the Lord of the Manor of Rochdale. During the 19th century a colliery at Captain Fold was run by the Heywood Coal Company. Two people were killed at Captain Fold between 1844<U+2013>1848. When the mine flooded in 1852 two more people were killed and the colliery closed soon after. Mining continued in the town with [[drift mining]] in Bamford until 1950.<ref>{{cite web |title=Captain Fold pit disaster |work=Heywood Advertiser |url=http://www.heywoodadvertiser.co.uk/community/nostalgia/s/388008_captain_fold_pit_disaster |date=10&nbsp;March 2003}} Retrieved on 1&nbsp;September 2008.</ref>

In 1881, the newly created [[Municipal Borough of Heywood]] included 67&nbsp;cotton mills and weaving sheds, 67&nbsp;machine works and other workshops, 75&nbsp;cotton waste and other warehouses and 5,877&nbsp;dwelling houses. It had 22 churches and chapels and 24&nbsp;Sunday and day schools. The population was estimated at 25,000.

The town was originally served by railway, with [[Heywood railway station]] to the south of the town. There were services to Bury [[Knowsley Street railway station|Knowsley Street station]] and [[Rochdale]], but this line was closed in the 1970s. However, the line has recently been re-opened to [[Bury]], as an extension to the [[East Lancashire Railway]] preservation project.

The town had its own canal, the [[Heywood Branch Canal]] which is now infilled and largely gone.

There is a local legend that men from Heywood used to have tails and that [[public house]]s had holes in their benches for tails to fit through. The legend led to the town developing the nickname of "Monkey Town".<ref>{{cite web |title=Island bench for a monkey |work=Heywood Advertiser |url=http://www.heywoodadvertiser.co.uk/news/w/89/89958_island_bench_for_a_monkey.html |date=15&nbsp;September 2004}} Retrieved on 1&nbsp;September 2008.</ref> This legend is actually fanciful, and the accepted reason is that the local area of "Heap Bridge", once a thriving part of the town was known as 'Ape Bridge when said in the local accent.

The southern wing of St Luke's church, well known throughout the area for its beautiful proportions and ornate carvings, is suggested to have been one of [[Hitler]]'s high-priority items for acquisition had he won the war. Although difficult to confirm, it is indeed one of the finest examples of its kind in the whole of England.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

In 2007 a plan to rejuvenate the town over a 10<U+2013>15 year period. The plan involves creating new retail, business, and community spaces and replacing 300 flats and houses to be demolished with 1,000 new homes. It was in response to a perceived "[[mill town]]" image and a migrating 19<U+2013>30 age range.<ref>{{citation |title=Radical plans for Heywood |publisher=[[Manchester Evening News]] |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1017728_radical_plans_for_heywood |date=27&nbsp;September 2007 |accessdate=30&nbsp;August 2008}}</ref>

Lying within the [[Historic counties of England|historic county boundaries]] of [[Lancashire]] since the early 12th century, Heywood during the [[Middle Ages]] constituted a [[chapelry]] in the [[township (England)|township]] of Heap, parish of [[Bury]], and [[Salford (hundred)|hundred of Salford]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> 

Following the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]], Heywood formed part of the Bury [[Poor Law Union]], an inter-parish unit established to provide [[social security]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> Heywood's first [[local authority]] was a [[Local board of health]] established in 1864;<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> Heap Middle Division Local Board of Health was a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation for the Heywood part of Heap township.<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> In 1867 the local board was reconstituted as the Heywood Local Board of Health which covered the whole of Heap township and parts of Hopwood, Birtle-with-Bamford, Pilsworth and [[Castleton, Greater Manchester|Castleton]] townships. In 1879 further parts of Hopwood and Pilsworth townships were added to the area under the local board. On 18&nbsp;February 1881 the area of the local board was granted [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]] and became the [[Municipal Borough of Heywood]], and following the [[Local Government Act 1894]] (which formally dissolved all townships) this borough became a local government district of the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of Lancashire.<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> In 1900 a part of Castleton Urban District was added to the Municipal Borough of Heywood, and in 1933 part of the Heywood borough was added to [[County Borough of Bury]] whilst in exchange, parts of Norden Urban District and of Birtle-with-Bamford and [[Unsworth]] [[civil parish]]es were added to the Borough of Heywood. In 1967, the Borough of Heywood became twinned with [[Peine]], Germany.<ref>{{cite web |title=Town twinning |publisher=Rochdale.gov.uk |url=http://www.rochdale.gov.uk/leisure_and_culture/libraries/town_twinning.aspx}} Retrieved on 31&nbsp;August 2008.</ref>

Under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the Municipal Borough of Heywood was abolished, and Heywood has, since 1&nbsp;April 1974, formed an [[unparished area]] of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale]], a local government district of the [[metropolitan county]] of [[Greater Manchester]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/><ref>HMSO. [[Local Government Act 1972]]. 1972 c.70.</ref>

In terms of parliamentary representation, Heywood after the [[Reform Act of 1832]] was represented as part of the [[South Lancashire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Lancashire constituency]], of which the first Members of Parliaments (MPs) were the [[Radicalism (historical)|radicals]] [[George William Wood]] and [[Charles Molyneux, 3rd Earl of Sefton|Charles Molyneux]]. Constituency boundaries changed throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and Heywood has lain within the [[South East Lancashire (UK Parliament constituency)|South East Lancashire]] (1868-1885), [[Heywood (UK Parliament constituency)|Heywood]] (1885-1918), [[Heywood and Radcliffe (UK Parliament constituency)|Heywood and Radcliffe]] (1918-1950), and [[Heywood and Royton (UK Parliament constituency)|Heywood and Royton]] (1950-1983) constituencies. Since 1983, Heywood has lain within [[Heywood and Middleton (UK Parliament constituency)|Heywood and Middleton]]. It is represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by [[Jim Dobbin]], a member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

The [[foundation stone]] of the present church building was laid on 31 May 1860. The church was consecrated on 8 October 1862 following a public subscription appeal.
