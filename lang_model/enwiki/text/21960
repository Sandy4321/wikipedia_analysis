'''Ren<U+00E9> Moncada''' (also "Ren<U+00E9> ''IATBA''" or simply "Ren<U+00E9>";<ref name="Greenpoint 2"/><ref name="Ladd"/> born 1943<ref name="SoHo"/>) is a [[South America]]n-born artist living in the [[United States of America]]. He is best known for a series of murals undertaken in [[New York City]]'s [[SoHo]] neighborhood between the late-1970s to early-1990s which spelled out the proclamation ''[[I AM THE BEST ARTIST Rene|I AM THE BEST ARTIST Ren<U+00E9>]]''.<ref name="SoHo"/><ref name="Tierney" /> He is also separately known for controversial artwork such as ''Sex and Violence'', which depicts a cross with a vagina at its center, and as an outspoken opponent of censorship in the arts.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ren<U+00E9> Moncada was born in [[Colombia]]. At the age of four he was brought to [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], by his father, a newspaper reporter.<ref name="Tierney" /><ref name="Rene site 2"/><ref name="Village Voice Mott"/>
Ren<U+00E9> speaks openly about his upbringing in a poor family.
The dichotomy of being the son of a very religious mother and an atheist father would inform Ren<U+00E9>'s views throughout his life.
Ultimately, Ren<U+00E9> states, his father's influence would shape his own intellect, instilling an inquisitive nature and inclination to question authority.<ref name="NYPress"/><ref name="Rene site 1"/>

====Baseball career====
Although Ren<U+00E9> had artistic aspirations as a child, his father pressed him into a baseball career, and Moncada went on to become a professional pitcher in Venezuelan major league baseball.<ref name="NYPress"/>
His rookie year was in 1961, and Ren<U+00E9> claims a record of seven no-hitters at that time.<ref name="Rene site 2"/>
In 1964 he was scouted by the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and brought to the United States.
20-year-old Moncada would begin his life in America as a minor league baseball pitcher.<ref name="Greenpoint 2"/><ref name="NYPress"/>
Ren<U+00E9> taught himself English during these early years in America, later claiming his drawing skills aided his progress.<ref name="Greenpoint 2"/>
Within a few years, however <U+2014> which included a stint as a pitching instructor <U+2014> his baseball days would come to an end.<ref name="NYPress"/>

==Art career==
By the end of the 1960s, Ren<U+00E9> Moncada had relocated to New York City.
Although lacking formal art schooling, he pursued his wishes of becoming an artist.<ref name="Greenpoint 2"/><ref name="NYPress"/>
Earliest art employment included commercial work as [[paste up|paste-up]] artist, art director and illustrator.
Men's magazines of the era based in New York provided regular work, including ''Gent'', ''Dude'', ''Nugget'' and ''Cheri''.<ref name="NYPress"/><ref name="Cheri"/>
Ren<U+00E9> also became a major contributor to [[Screw (magazine)|''Screw'']] magazine, which provided an outlet for the artist's early erotic illustrations, and a forum for later anti-censorship [[wikt:diatribe|diatribes]].<ref name="Screw Mott 2"/>

===''Rene's Gallery''===
Ren<U+00E9> Moncada, by then married to wife Joanne, moved to SoHo in the mid-1970s.
The couple were among the earliest residents of SoHo through its rise as the center of the New York art world in the 1980s.<ref name="Krauze" /><ref name="Arts magazine" /> They rented the ground floor at 147 Wooster Street, which included the storefront, between Houston and Prince streets.<ref name="Tierney" />
Ren<U+00E9> renovated the storefront space and opened it as ''Rene's Gallery'' in 1977.<ref name="SoHo"/><ref name="Village Voice Mott"/><ref name="NYPress"/>
It would also sometimes be referred to as ''I Am The Best Artist'' gallery once Ren<U+00E9>'s signature murals had gained notoriety.<ref name="Greenpoint 2"/>
The gallery was mostly used to showcase Ren<U+00E9>'s own work <U+2014> "a monument to himself", as noted by [[John Strausbaugh]] in a 1990s ''[[New York Press]]'' cover story and interview.<ref name="NYPress"/>
The artist was always available and anxious to discuss his work with visitors, and could often be found toiling with new artwork in the gallery.
He also used the rear space as his studio.<ref name="Tierney" /><ref name="Baykam"/>
Ren<U+00E9> naively thought opening his own gallery would earn entry into the burgeoning SoHo art set, and went about inviting neighboring gallery owners to come for studio visits or private viewings, but his invitations <U+2014> and presence in general <U+2014> went largely ignored.<ref name="Village Voice Mott"/>
Regardless of art world disregard, Ren<U+00E9> became a SoHo "fixture".<ref name="Village Voice Mott"/>

His gallery existed during a time when one could be walking the streets of SoHo aimlessly one minute and, following the sound of music and commotion emanating from any given window, enter and find oneself rubbing shoulders with a who's who of SoHo art luminaries the next minute.
Ren<U+00E9> himself may have been present for such festivities, identifiable in a denim jacket painted with his ''Best Artist'' "slogan", which he also emblazoned onto t-shirts and caps.<ref name="SoHo"/><ref name="Tierney" />
He hosted such gatherings in his own gallery as well; it was the site of fashion shows, events by performance artists such as [[Annie Sprinkle]], and exhibitions of artists such as [[Lennie Mace]], whose exhibition publicity listed the gallery indistinctly as ''147 Wooster Gallery''.<ref name="SoHo"/><ref name="NYP contributor"/>
Ren<U+00E9>'s gallery was also listed internationally in guide books of Manhattan and SoHo during its existence.<ref name="Guide"/><ref name="Japan"/>
It was also sometimes rented for private parties, making SoHo ambience available to nonresidents.<ref name="SoHo"/>

Ren<U+00E9> and Joanne Moncada lived in the space to the rear of the gallery. Side-stepping city ordinances prohibiting ground-floor residency, they constructed a second-floor sleeping loft above the gallery space.<ref name="SoHo"/>
Ren<U+00E9> kept the gallery open into 1999, when he and Joanne were pressured out of their long-time Wooster Street space.
In 2001 the Moncadas relocated to Brooklyn.<ref name="Greenpoint 2"/><ref name="SoHo"/>

==''I AM THE BEST ARTIST'' murals==
[[File:IATBAwall.jpg|thumb|300px|Mural along West Broadway, [[SoHo]], New York City, 1986.]]
{{Main|I AM THE BEST ARTIST Rene}}

Ren<U+00E9>, who in later interviews described feeling "ignored" by the art community he felt he'd helped pioneer, decided to take matters into his own hands.<ref name="SoHo"/><ref name="Tierney" /><ref name="Village Voice Mott"/> Beginning in the late-1970s,<ref name="NYPress"/> Ren<U+00E9> began painting a series of impressively sized [[mural]]s on prominently located walls of SoHo, proclaiming ''I AM THE BEST ARTIST Ren<U+00E9>'' to all who walked or drove past.<ref name="SoHo"/><ref name="Village Voice Mott"/><ref name="Vincent" /> The undertaking, however indirectly, placed Ren<U+00E9> at the forefront of [[street art]]ists of the era<ref name="Tierney" /> transforming the streets of [[SoHo]]'s art district into an alternative exhibition venue.<ref name="SoHo"/>

Ren<U+00E9><U+2019>s ubiquitous declarations, spelled out in large, capital letters<ref name="Tierney" /> punctuated by his signature "Ren<U+00E9>" written in a flowing font,<ref name="SoHo"/> became a topic of conversation and debate at the time, and provided a backdrop to photographs taken by a multitude of tourists, art students, advertising layouts in magazines worldwide and Hollywood films.<ref name="SoHo NY"/><ref name="Film"/> The murals became icons not only of the neighborhood but of the era in general,<ref name="Village Voice Mott"/> when art became a profitable commodity and SoHo became its Wall Street.<ref name="SoHo"/> They were likened to effective advertising slogans and later recognized as an early act of "art provocation".<ref name="NYPress"/>

Mural locations were centered along the stretch of West Broadway between Houston Street and Canal Street.<ref name="NYPress"/> The most prominent mural, near the corner of Broome Street and West Broadway (''pictured here''), measured 10 feet by 50.<ref name="SoHo"/> The largest of the murals was located on a wall along the southwest corner of West Broadway where Grand Street intersects.<ref name="Village Voice Mott"/> This location appears in a montage sequence of the 1987 movie [[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of My Success]], among other [[iconic]] images of 1980s New York City in general, and SoHo in particular.<ref name="Film"/>

===Conflict and criticism===
Although the murals became renowned, Ren<U+00E9> himself remained an enigmatic figure to average passersby.<ref name="SoHo"/> Conflicts related to the murals attracted media attention,<ref name="Leagle"/> and lawsuits related to the murals raised legal discussion about intellectual property, artist<U+2019>s rights, and the [[First Amendment]].<ref name="Landes" /><ref name="Ginsburgh" /><ref name="Lerner" /> Ren<U+00E9> claims the art critic [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] once assured him directly that he was not, in fact, the best artist. An ''[[Artforum]]'' writer used an unrelated art review to shine a negative light on ''The Best Artist'', calling Ren<U+00E9> "untalented" and "unchic".
Loss of long-time artist friends was another unfortunate consequence.<ref name="NYPress"/>

Ren<U+00E9> always insisted permission was obtained from landlords to paint the murals,<ref name="SoHo"/><ref name="Tierney" /> but requests were also sometimes refused, with some SoHo residents commenting that though a mural would be welcome, a ''[[I AM THE BEST ARTIST Rene|I AM THE BEST ARTIST Ren<U+00E9>]]'' mural would ''not'' be welcome.
In the case of one refusal, Moncada painted the attendants' stand of the parking lot facing the declined property, getting permission from its owner instead.<ref name="SoHo"/>
Vandals often defaced these walls with sarcastic embellishment such as "I Am The Best Fartist" or added simplistic commentary such as "I hate you".
''IATBA'' murals which may have been defaced would be faithfully repainted by Ren<U+00E9>.<ref name="NYPress"/><ref name="SoHo2"/>

As the neighborhood went upscale and the value of blank wall space rose with property values,<ref name="SoHo"/><ref name="Krauze"/> ''I AM THE BEST ARTIST Ren<U+00E9>'' murals were one-by-one covered by billboards or otherwise destroyed. One was removed after the landlord demanded $500.00 per month to allow Moncada's mural to remain.<ref name="Ladd" />
Ren<U+00E9> later adapted its abbreviation (''IATBA'') into a surname of sorts.<ref name="Greenpoint 2"/><ref name="Ladd"/>

==''Mott's'' apple juice controversy==
[[File:Rene Moncada Mott's apple juice art compared with redesigned label 1982.jpg|thumb|270px|Ren<U+00E9>'s 1982 painting of ''Mott's'' apple juice can (left) with a photo of the subsequently redesigned label, sexually suggestive content eliminated (right, 1983).]]
During the 1970s, Moncada would become well known in New York art and sex scenes for his artistic representations of female genitalia,<ref name="NYPress"/><ref name="Screw Mott 2"/> making the artist a some-time target of anti-pornographic groups over the years.<ref name="Village Voice Mott"/>
An ability to pick out subliminally depicted labia from advertisements and elsewhere, whether actual or imagined,<ref name="Village Voice Mott"/> was exploited in a recurring magazine article in which Ren<U+00E9>, dubbing himself "Nature's Ambassador", would point out occurrences of "the sacred image" peeking out from, as per one entry, sculptural elements found decorating New York's [[Central Park]].<ref name="Cheri"/>

In the early 1980s, Ren<U+00E9> noticed what seemed to him a subliminal image embedded within the label design of [[Mott's]] apple juice cans.<ref name="Screw Mott 1"/>
The label, showing a detailed rendering of a halved apple, contained what Ren<U+00E9> insisted was an obvious representation of a vagina.
Ren<U+00E9> created a painted replica of the can, similar to [[Andy Warhol]]'s [[Campbell's Soup Cans|Campbell's Soup]] artwork.
With the full painting standing at 5-feet high, the small detail <U+2014> otherwise unaltered by the artist <U+2014> stood out that much more.<ref name="Village Voice Mott"/>
[[Screw (magazine)|''Screw'']] magazine featured a version of it on the cover of issue #725 and also reported related events which ensued.<ref name="Screw Mott 2"/><ref name="Screw Mott 1"/>

Ren<U+00E9> held an exhibition at his own gallery in 1983 showcasing his Mott's painting, among other related works.
The artist invited Mott's representatives, fully aware of possible retribution, and welcoming it.
Ren<U+00E9>'s "Big Apple Show" also displayed the letters sent to Mott's, and their replies.<ref name="Village Voice Mott"/>
Everyone who attended the opening reception received a poster of Ren<U+00E9>'s painted rendition.<ref name="Screw Mott 2"/>

A 1981 ''[[Village Voice]]'' article titled "Apple of Temptation" covered Ren<U+00E9>'s ''Mott's'' artwork, and ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine included Ren<U+00E9> in their annual "Year in Sex" review.<ref name="Village Voice Mott"/><ref name="Playboy"/>
''Mott's'' redesigned the label soon thereafter, removing any hint of that to which Ren<U+00E9> had drawn attention (''pictured''), and avoiding any presupposed corporate embarrassment.<ref name="NYPress"/><ref name="Screw Mott 2"/>

{{cquote|''If I could sign my checks with a drawing of a vagina, I would, but the bank won't allow it.''  <small>Ren<U+00E9> Moncada <ref name="Village Voice Mott"/><ref name="Screw Mott 2"/></small>}}

Ren<U+00E9> subsequently created many versions of apples with female genitalia as their core, including drawings, paintings, carvings and other 3-dimensional objects.<ref name="Screw Mott 2"/>
One version of the apple titled ''Original Sin'', hand-carved into 2-inch-thick wood, was included in the book ''Forbidden Art'', an anthology of similarly themed artworks.<ref name="forbidden"/>
Ren<U+00E9> continued to feature vaginas prominently in his artwork <U+2014> aware it may negatively affect sales and, therefore, gallery interest <U+2014> even as other artists have achieved broader acceptability by painting euphemistic representations.<ref name="Village Voice Mott"/>

As for his use of vaginas in his artwork, Ren<U+00E9> considers it "the purest image".<ref name="Rene site 3"/>
"The shape is a basic structure, a universal image. It's in nature, you can find it everywhere," he explained to ''The Village Voice''.<ref name="Village Voice Mott"/>
To comments inferring its usage might be considered "monotonous" or "mono thematic", Ren<U+00E9> points out that while others have come and gone, gaining attention by exploiting the image, his interest remains intact, claiming he is "not interested in being shocking and outrageous".<ref name="Village Voice Mott"/>
In response to criticism contending Ren<U+00E9> shouldn't expose images of a vagina to children, he explains that in this context children wouldn't even know what it is, and, if they did know, it's because someone else has already shown them what it is. "If the kid recognizes it as something bad <U+2014> obscene, disgusting <U+2014> it's because somebody put this idea into his head already."<ref name="NYPress"/>

==''Sex and Violence''==
Ren<U+00E9> Moncada's predilection for rendering female genitalia culminated in the creation of one of the artist's most infamous images.
Created, in Ren<U+00E9>'s words, "to liberate art from the dictatorship of religion," ''Sex and Violence'' very simply depicted a [[Christian cross]] with a vagina at its center.<ref name="Sex &Violence"/>
The artist himself conceded to the controversial nature of his own creation,<ref name="Sex &Violence"/> while separately joking about it as a "piece" symbol.<ref name="NYPress"/>

A [[manifesto]] printed as a full page in ''SCREW'' magazine outlined Rene's ambitions for ''Sex and Violence''.
As he also explained to ''New York Press'', Ren<U+00E9> believes he had "united two things that everybody insists on separating. What I have put together is the creation of God to give life to his son, with the creation of men to kill him."
The vagina, Ren<U+00E9> continued, represents "love, pleasure and life itself" while the cross represents an "instrument of violence created by man, to kill" or "torture."
As he'd done with his Mott's artwork, Ren<U+00E9> obsessively created multiple renditions of the image in a variety of [[list of artistic media|mediums]].<ref name="NYPress"/><ref name="Sex &Violence"/>

===Anti-censorship proponent===
Ren<U+00E9> Moncada is a vocal opponent of censorship, hypocrisy and oppression.<ref name="Tierney" /><ref name="NYPress"/>
He has justified some of his actions as a desire to liberate not only the art world but also the world at large.<ref name="Village Voice Mott"/>
It is these attributes, he supposes, which may qualify him as "the best artist" <U+2014> artistic skills aside.<ref name="Village Voice Mott"/>
Ren<U+00E9> blames the susceptibility of people to religious [[dogma]] with a return to prudishness and the proliferation of special interest groups,<ref name="Village Voice Mott"/> and jokes that censorship has succeeded in making people so stupid that "bowling balls will soon be printed with the instructions ''For External Use Only''".<ref name="NYPress"/>

A 1981 speaking engagement at [[Fordham University]] titled "The Facts of Life and How They Affect the Creative Process" was quashed by then-Associate Dean of Students Mary Raddock prior to its presentation on the basis that Ren<U+00E9> displays "insufficient regard for the human body" in his artwork, additionally citing the lack of a University-affiliated sponsor.
Even after organizers attained a recognized entity as a sponsor (Fordham's ''The Monthly'' publication), Raddock held steadfast in her belief that Ren<U+00E9>'s work was inappropriate.
Students with knowledge of the event openly denounced the perceived censorship upon learning of its cancellation.
Consensus among students proclaimed the right to decide what is indecent or what is art.
Raddock denied censorship in an interview with Fordham's ''The Ram'', which reported the turn of events, insisting that one must "show some kind of common sense in these things."<ref name="Fordham"/>

{{cquote|''If it wasn't for pornography, I would've been a pervert.''  <small>Ren<U+00E9> Moncada<ref name="Rene site 3"/></small>}}

In his "AMACA" exhibition ("Artistic Movement Against Censorship in Art"),<ref name="AMACA"/> Ren<U+00E9> unveiled another work of art which incorporates a thought-provoking proclamation within the composition.
As both title and headline, ''Censorship Is The Shield Of The Corrupt'' appears across the top of the black and white, banner-like composition.<ref name="Rene site 1"/><ref name="Sex &Violence"/>
Below it, a [[Christian cross]], an Islamic [[star and crescent]], a [[star of David]], and a [[swastika]] are depicted side by side as simple graphics.
Across the bottom reads ''Our Fathers Who Art In Heaven, Let Us Art Free On Earth''.<ref name="Rene site 1"/>
Ren<U+00E9> describes such vehement anger from viewers that his explanation of the fact that the religious symbols have been responsible for as much death as the swastika often went ignored.<ref name="NYPress"/><ref name="AMACA"/>

====1982 arrest====
An incident on the steps of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] involving Ren<U+00E9>'s ''Sex and Violence'' resulted in the arrest of Ren<U+00E9> and ''Screw'' magazine publisher [[Al Goldstein]].<ref name="Tierney" />
For a video shoot staged in July 1982, for Goldstein's [[Midnight Blue (TV series)|''Midnight Blue'']] [[public-access television|public-access]] program <U+2014> during an era when scandals involving [[Jim Bakker#Scandals|Jim and Tammy Bakker]], [[Jimmy Swaggart#Scandals|Jimmy Swaggart]], and other religious leaders were headline news <U+2014> Ren<U+00E9> created a large [[papier-m<U+00E2>ch<U+00E9>]] cross of ''Sex and Violence'' as a prop.
In a scene intended to [[lampooning|lampoon]] religious hypocrisy, Goldstein, dressed as Jesus Christ and carrying Ren<U+00E9>'s creation, is ousted from the church by another participant and pushed down the steps.<ref name="Arrest"/>

The shoot attracted disapproving onlookers and police, who ordered the group to cease filming and then proceeded to arrest them, with Goldstein reportedly shouting "Keep filming!" and "Render unto Caesar!" as he was taken into custody.<ref name="NYPress"/><ref name="Arrest"/>
Damage done to Ren<U+00E9>'s ''Sex and Violence'' cross at the hands of bystanders went uninvestigated by police at the scene.<ref name="Arrest"/>

==Other projects==

===''Nudismos''===
''Nudismos'' are Ren<U+00E9>'s fashion innovation in which the artist hand-weaves outfits directly onto the customer, creating bikinis or dresses of varying length and coverage.
Ren<U+00E9> explains the title ''Nudismos'' as relating to both the Spanish word for "knot" (nudo) and the English word "nude".
Using knots, the outfits are custom fitted to the wearers' contours, covering strategic parts of the body while leaving other areas bare, in an overall motif resembling [[cobweb]]s.
The more daring the wearer's disposition, the more daring the outfit's coverage. The project attracted a modest amount of attention for the artist in the United States and Venezuela. Ren<U+00E9> staged runway shows in his own gallery to promote his fashions, which were worn by adult video actresses, strippers and would-be models.<ref name="Nudismos"/><ref name="NYPress"/><ref name="Rene site 3"/>

==="E-Vent" at Museum of Modern Art===
In 1988 Ren<U+00E9> staged another act of "art provocation" at New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMa) in the spirit of [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s [[Dadaism|Dadaist]] concept of [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|ready-made]] art.
Rene sent out invitations to friends and fellow artists and announced to the media the permanent installation of a new work of Ren<U+00E9> art at the museum.
Commandeering an air ventilation grill already installed at the museum <U+2014> a functioning part of its air conditioning system <U+2014> Ren<U+00E9> announced to a confused crowd that he thereby claimed the grill as a work of art in his own name.
Ren<U+00E9> justified his actions by noting that Duchamp's theory of artists having the authority of claiming found objects as art <U+2014> acknowledged by the art world via inclusion in museum collections (some on display in adjacent rooms) <U+2014> gave him the right to claim the ventilation grill.
Ren<U+00E9>, in subsequent interviews, continued to express certain pride in the fact that his "artwork" would remain on permanent display at the museum, recognized or not.<ref name="Tierney"/><ref name="NYPress"/><ref name="Interview"/>

====Found-object sculptures====
Creating artwork using discarded objects and refuse has been an ongoing interest of the artist, appearing in various guises over time. Embellishing the aluminum skeleton of an upright vacuum cleaner, Rene crafted an unmistakable likeness of a long-barreled rifle.<ref name="NYPress"/> Onto vintage canvas [[dress form]]s found on the streets of SoHo, Rene painted flesh tones, including tan lines, and nipples.<ref name="Playboy"/><ref name="Rene site 3"/>
Rene intuitively reassembled parts of a typewriter into a beetle, years later coming across a photo of one in [[National Geographic (magazine)|''National Geographic'']] magazine which bore resemblance to his own.<ref name="Rene site 3"/>

Ren<U+00E9> in 1986 infused eco-political ideology to his "found objects" in Venezuela. Water quality at the country's [[Lake Maracaibo]] was suffering greatly due to the proliferation of oil drilling and the dumping of raw sewage. Upon hearing of this, Ren<U+00E9> presided over a congregation to publicize the dismaying conditions. As part of his group's efforts, a blank canvas was placed in the lake until it had absorbed a coating of the oil and sewage present in the water. Unfurled at the entrance to Venezuela's National Art Gallery in [[Caracas]], the heat drew unpleasant odors from the canvas, adding to the episode. In response to orders from authorities to "Clean it up", Ren<U+00E9> countered "No, ''you'' clean it up." Ren<U+00E9> became a celebrity of the cause during that time, attracting media attention while also embarrassing the Venezuelan government. He went on to refer to his handiwork sarcastically as both an "oil painting" and a "still life". Ren<U+00E9> also created sculptures of waste accumulated along Venezuelan beaches.<ref name="NYPress"/>

Beginning in the 1990s, Ren<U+00E9> intermittently provided art instruction as a volunteer at institutions such as the [[Henry Street Settlement]] and [[Children's Museum of New York]].<ref name="Rene site 3"/><ref name="Greenpoint 1"/> At a time when [[New York State Education Department|Department of Education]] budget cuts were negatively affecting funding of many such art programs in New York City, Ren<U+00E9> devised what he believed to be a rational plan to assist in gaining funding. The artist's proposal entailed teaching students to create simple yet attractive [[Biomorphism|biomorphic]] constructions using discarded [[styrofoam]] and other cheap materials, then organizing fund-raising drives at which the creations could be auctioned to supporters in what a local newspaper referred to as a "Styrofoam Bailout".<ref name="Greenpoint 2"/> Ren<U+00E9> imagined that the sculptures <U+2014> which require no special training to create <U+2014> might act as a status symbol, showing that its buyer is a proven supporter of art programs in New York City.<ref name="Greenpoint 1"/> In the process, Ren<U+00E9> adds, discipline and self-esteem can be instilled in students, positively influencing their attention span and inherent creative impulses. Ren<U+00E9> had, himself, been creating such sculptures using the same materials since the 1990s, calling the lightweight sculptures ''Mental Floss'', and repurposing found objects to create artwork continues as one aspect of the artist's work.<ref name="Greenpoint 2"/><ref name="Rene site 3"/><ref name="Greenpoint 1"/>

==Personal==
Ren<U+00E9> is a naturalized American citizen.
Ren<U+00E9> often credits the support of his wife Joanne with allowing him to pursue the life of an artist.<ref name="Greenpoint 1"/>
