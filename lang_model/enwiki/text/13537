'''Mick Flannery''' (born November 28, 1983) is an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[singer-songwriter]] and [[Stonemasonry|stonemason]] from [[Blarney]], [[County Cork]].

His debut album ''Evening Train'' resulted from his time spent studying music and management at Col<U+00E1>iste Stiof<U+00E1>in Naofa in [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. It featured tracks which had previously won Flannery two categories at the [[International Songwriting Competition]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], as judged by his idol, [[Tom Waits]]. He was the first Irish musician to win in this event.

Flannery's second studio album ''[[White Lies (Mick Flannery album)|White Lies]]'' was released on September 12, 2008, achieving a top ten position on the [[Irish Albums Chart]]. It later went platinum and was nominated for the [[Choice Music Prize]].

''[[The Irish Times]]'' placed him at number forty-six in a list of "The 50 Best Irish Acts Right Now" published in April 2009. Also that year Flannery won Best Irish Male at the [[2009 Meteor Awards]]. Other influences include [[Kurt Cobain]], [[Leonard Cohen]] and [[Bob Dylan]].

==Early years==
Flannery was reared on farmland outside Blarney, County Cork.<ref name="Other Voices"/><ref name="Top artists to pay a festive visit to the INEC"/><ref name="Stone mason sings">{{cite web|url=http://www.drogheda-independent.ie/news/stone-mason-sings-1961374.html|title=Stone mason sings|date=December 2, 2009|accessdate=January 9, 2010|publisher=''[[Drogheda Independent]]''}}</ref>

Coming from a family with a keen musical interest, Flannery was introduced to folk and blues music at a young age. 

{{cquote|My mother's side were big into music, more than my dad's side. My mother is a singer and she plays the guitar. She recorded an album of her own actually two years ago. And it was her brothers and sisters that kind of got me into music. [...] At those family nights there was a good bit of [[Tom Waits]], a bit of [[Bob Dylan|Dylan]]. Most of the singers would be female, my aunts, and they would sing [[Tracy Chapman]] and [[Joni Mitchell]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Linda McGee|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2008/0930/flannerym.html|title=Mick Flannery Interview|date=September 30, 2008|accessdate=January 9, 2010|publisher=[[Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann|RT<U+00C9>]]}}</ref>}}

Flannery cites an encounter with the music of [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] as a direct influence on his desire to become a musician.<ref name="Other Voices"/><ref name="Stone mason sings"/> Seeing Cobain perform "[[The Man Who Sold the World]]" on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' he promptly purchased a copy of ''[[MTV Unplugged in New York]]''.<ref name="Top artists to pay a festive visit to the INEC"/><ref name="Stone mason sings"/><ref name="Other Voices"/> He soon bought the album ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'' as well.<ref name="Other Voices"/> Flannery claims to have written his first song at the age of fifteen.<ref name="Interview: Mick Flannery"/> His first completed song was called "Mad Man's Road", a tale of a murder which took place on the road in which he lived.<ref name="Interview: Mick Flannery"/> He has been dismissive of his earlier material, referring to it as "tripe".<ref name="A Rolling Stone: Ex-stonemason Mick Flannery looks set to hit the big time"/>

However, he is keen to express his fondness for stonemasonry and its position alongside his music: "I wasn't going to sit in a room and write songs seven days a week and live on bread and beans. I liked doing stonemasonry as well".<ref name="A Rolling Stone: Ex-stonemason Mick Flannery looks set to hit the big time"/> He still does it on an occasional basis: "We wouldn<U+2019>t be carving gravestones or anything. We<U+2019>d do the fronts of houses, entrance walls, stuff like that".<ref name="Talk time">{{cite web|author=Eoin Butler|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/magazine/2009/0801/1224251464496.html|title=Talk time|date=August 1, 2009|accessdate=January 9, 2010|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''|quote='''You have two well-received albums under your belt, but you<U+2019>re actually a stonemason by trade. Are you finished with all that now?''' No, I did two weeks helping a buddy finish a job before Christmas. He<U+2019>ll call on me now and again if I<U+2019>m not gigging and ask me if I want to come out and do a day. We wouldn<U+2019>t be carving gravestones or anything. We<U+2019>d do the fronts of houses, entrance walls, stuff like that. '''Using a lump hammer and chisel?''' Yeah. It<U+2019>s hard work, especially in the winter. But, I<U+2019>ll tell you, when I left it to do music . . . it was weird at first. In stonemasonry, you<U+2019>d do a long day<U+2019>s work and sleep soundly at night because you<U+2019>re properly tired. When you<U+2019>re doing gigs, you<U+2019>re more mentally tired than anything else. You have a couple of drinks and try and get to sleep. But it<U+2019>s not the same. So getting back to stonemasonry for a day or two when I can is always nice. [...] '''It<U+2019>s a bit of a culture shock then, isn<U+2019>t it, moving from that into the world of media or public relations?''' God yeah, there<U+2019>s so much nonsense. Take MySpace and Facebook and all of that, for example. I don<U+2019>t get on a computer often, but I have people working on those sites on my behalf. From time to time, they<U+2019>d send out messages to people. So then these people approach me at gigs to thank me for wishing them a happy birthday and I have no idea what they<U+2019>re talking about. I find that really sick, you know? [...] '''Your third album is mostly written. Do you have particular ambitions for it?''' I<U+2019>m not hung up about record sales, but I<U+2019>ve always wanted to record one of those albums that lodges itself in the public consciousness, that has its own stamp creatively, rather than commercially. Something like Tom Wait<U+2019>s ''Closing Time'', Bruce Springsteen<U+2019>s ''Nebraska'' or Bob Dylan<U+2019>s ''Blood on the Tracks''. That<U+2019>s what I aspire to.}}</ref>

==History==

===''Evening Train''===
While undergoing a music and management course at Col<U+00E1>iste Stiof<U+00E1>in Naofa in Cork, Flannery commenced writing the album that would become ''Evening Train'', an eleven-track [[concept album]] about the exploits of two brothers.<ref name="Other Voices"/><ref name="Programme 1: Mick Flannery"/> His original intention had been to write a musical but this endeavour proved unsuccessful.<ref name="Other Voices"/>

Before its release Flannery and a friend who worked alongside him in the stonemasonry business embarked on a three-month trip to the United States, living in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]].<ref name="Interview: Mick Flannery"/><ref name="Q&A: Mick Flannery"/> Flannery spent his time performing in [[New York]].<ref name="Interview: Mick Flannery"/> His sister was present for one of the months and assisted him with organising his performances.<ref name="Q&A: Mick Flannery"/> Flannery, however, quickly became disillusioned by the New York music scene, and referred to it in one interview as "a bit up its own arse".<ref name="Interview: Mick Flannery"/>

''Evening Train'' was received positively by critics in Ireland and the United States.<ref name="Other Voices"/> Reviewers noted its "astute and sophisticated lyrics", its "strong, imaginative melodies", its [[Tom Waits]] sound.<ref name="Programme 1: Mick Flannery"/><ref name="Mick Flannery - White Lies (entertainment.ie)"/><ref name="Top artists to pay a festive visit to the INEC"/> The ''[[RT<U+00C9> Guide]]'' later said, "His voice was like Tom Waits meets the howling of a grizzled freight train hobo".<ref name="Star of the Day: The Quiet Man">{{cite web|url=http://www.rteguide.ie/2008/0919/1.html|title=Star of the Day: The Quiet Man|date=September 19, 2008|accessdate=January 9, 2010|publisher=''[[RT<U+00C9> Guide]]''}}</ref> [[entertainment.ie]] reviewer Lauren Murphy described it as "an album dripping with maturity, poise and potential" and that "the most astounding thing" was his age of 21 years.<ref name="Mick Flannery - White Lies (entertainment.ie)"/><ref name="Interview: Mick Flannery"/>

Flannery signed with [[EMI Records]] in 2007.<ref name="Interview: Mick Flannery"/><ref name="Other Voices"/> That same year he was the subject of a programme called ''Mytunes'', broadcast on [[RT<U+00C9> Radio 1]] on November 29.<ref name="Programme 1: Mick Flannery">{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/mytunes/1170319.html|title=Programme 1: Mick Flannery|date=November 29, 2007|accessdate=January 9, 2010|publisher=[[RT<U+00C9> Radio 1]]}}</ref> He performed on [[RT<U+00C9> Two]]'s ''[[Other Voices (TV series)|Other Voices]]'' television programme in 2008.<ref name="Other Voices">{{cite web|author=Harry Guerin|url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/othervoices/mickflannery.html|title=Other Voices|accessdate=January 9, 2010|publisher=''[[Other Voices (TV series)|Other Voices]]''}}</ref> This appearance led to increased interest in Flannery's music in Ireland.<ref name="Mick Flannery - White Lies (RT<U+00C9>)"/> The show's presenter [[Annie Mac]], a [[disc jockey]] based in [[London]], later admitted she had never heard of Flannery before witnessing his performance.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eoin Butler|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/magazine/2009/1128/1224259367880.html|title=Turn the tables|date=November 28, 2009|accessdate=January 9, 2010|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''|quote=Nonetheless, she admits she has had to swat up a bit for her role as a presenter of RT<U+00C9><U+2019>s ''Other Voices''. Before presenting the show for the first time last year, she<U+2019>d never heard of some of the Irish acts she introduced, such as Imelda May and Mick Flannery, both of whom enormously impressed her.

The former stonemason had hung up his chisel in search of musical fulfilment several years back, yet his 2005 debut album (''Evening Train'') failed to make any huge impression, despite the Corkonian<U+2019>s talent as a writer and performer. Last year<U+2019>s Choice- nominated ''White Lies'' changed everything. With this stunning exhibition of the gravel-voiced musician<U+2019>s abilities, Flannery turned his hand to mournful piano ballads and catchy guitar tunes with a flair that far surpasses his 25 years.}}</ref>
