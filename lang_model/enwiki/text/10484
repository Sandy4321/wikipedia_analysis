'''Ithiel Town''' (October 3, [[1784]] - [[June 13]], [[1844]]) was a prominent [[United States|American]] [[architect]] and [[civil engineer]]. 

Town was born in [[Thompson, Connecticut]] to Archelaus and Martha (Johnson) Town.  He trained with the eminent [[Asher Benjamin]] in [[Boston]] and began his own professional career with the [[Asa Gray House]] (1810).

His earliest important architectural works include Center Church ([[1812]]-[[1815]]), and Trinity Church ([[1813]]-[[1816]], one of the earliest [[Gothic Revival]] churches in America) on the [[New Haven Green]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. In [[1820]], he designed and patented a form of the wooden [[truss]] [[bridge]], Town's Lattice Truss, which became widely used throughout the United States. Town's truss design can still be seen in two of [[Connecticut]]'s remaining [[covered bridge]]s, Bull's Bridge in [[Kent, Connecticut|Kent]] and West Cornwall Bridge in [[Cornwall, Connecticut|Cornwall]] and [[Sharon, Connecticut|Sharon]]. Many other extant covered bridges also employ Town's basic design.

In 1829, Town formed one of the first professional architectural firms in the United States with [[Alexander Jackson Davis]], together producing notable buildings in a range of new Revival styles, including [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek]], [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]], [[Tuscan Revival architecture|Tuscan]], and [[Egyptian Revival architecture|Egyptian]]. The firm lasted until 1835; for eighteen months in 1832-1833, it operated as Town, Davis, and Dakin, when James H. Dakin joined the firm. Their works included the state capitol in New Haven, the city hall and [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the capitol buildings of [[Indiana]], and [[North Carolina]] (1833-1840), and the U.S. Custom House, now [[Federal Hall]], in [[New York City]] (1833-1842).  During this time, Town also designed the [[Potomac Aqueduct]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] (1833-1843), which allowed fully loaded canal boats to cross the [[Potomac River]]. It was considered one of the most remarkable engineering feats of the time.

Town designed his New Haven home on [[Hillhouse Avenue]] in the [[Greek Revival]] style; here he kept what was then an extraordinary architectural library &mdash; an inspiration to many, including Davis and another noted New Haven architect, [[Henry Austin (architect)|Henry Austin]].  The house was later owned by [[Joseph Earl Sheffield]], benefactor of the [[Sheffield Scientific School]] and modified by Austin.  Town designed a number of stately homes on Hillhouse.  In 1825, Town was awarded an MA degree from [[Yale University]] and subsequently left many of his books to Yale upon his death.

In 1825, Town also became one of the original members of the [[National Academy of Design]], and traveled in Europe in 1829-30. In 1839, Town commissioned noted American painter [[Thomas Cole]] to execute a painting called The Architect's Dream, which now hangs in the [[Toledo Museum of Art]]. Town died in New Haven on June 13, 1844, and is interred in [[Grove Street Cemetery]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]].
