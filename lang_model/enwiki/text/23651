'''Lawrence Patrick David Gillick''' (born {{birth date|mf=yes|1937|8|22}}) is a retired [[United States|American]] [[professional baseball]] executive. He was the [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]] of four [[Major League Baseball]] teams, and guided two teams to three [[World Series]] championships in his career: in 1992 and 1993 titles with the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], and a 2008 title with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].

Gillick was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 2011.

==Early life==
Gillick was born to former minor league baseball player Larry Gillick in [[Chico, California|Chico]], [[California]].  In 1951, he earned his [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] from the [[Boy Scouts of America]].  He continued to stay involved in Scouting and received the [[Order of the Arrow]]'s [[Vigil Honor]] mere months after winning the College World Series at USC.  After graduating from Notre Dame High School in [[Sherman Oaks]], California, Pat attended [[University of Southern California|USC]] and joined the Delta Chi Fraternity. He graduated in 1958 with a degree in [[business]]. He was also a gifted [[pitcher]], playing on the [[1958 College World Series|1958 National Title]] baseball team at USC and spending five years in the minor league systems of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] and the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], venturing as high as Triple-A. A left-hander, Gillick posted a won/lost record of 45<U+2013>32 with an [[earned run average]] of 3.42 in 164 minor league games.

==Front office career==
Gillick retired from playing and began a front-office career in 1963 when he became the assistant farm director with the [[Houston Astros]]. He would eventually work his way up to the position of Director of Scouting before moving to the [[New York Yankees]] system in 1974 as a Coordinator of Player Development. In 1976, he moved again, this time to the expansion [[Toronto Blue Jays]], becoming their Vice President of Player Personnel, and in 1977, their Vice President of Baseball Operations. Prior to the team's second season, he became the general manager. In 1984, he was named Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations.

As Toronto's general manager, Gillick won five division titles (1985, 1989, 1991, 1992 and 1993) and led the club to their first [[World Series]] championships in 1992 and 1993. Shortly after Gillick left, the Blue Jays went into decline, not finishing higher than 3rd place until the 2006 season.

In 1995, Gillick was named the general manager of the Baltimore Orioles organization and he guided the Orioles to the playoffs in 1996 and 1997. He left at the conclusion of his three-year contract in 1998. The Orioles have not had a winning season since.

Gillick then became the general manager of the [[Seattle Mariners]], who had parlayed their incredible 1995 playoff run into a new ballpark and the financial resources to become a perennial contender. Upon his hiring, the responsibility fell on Gillick to trade Ken Griffey Jr. to Cincinnati after Griffey played out his final season in Seattle. The Mariners made back-to-back playoff appearances for the only time in franchise history in 2000 and 2001, and the 2001 team, with a 116-46 record, tied the 1906 Chicago Cubs for the all time [[Major League Baseball]] record for most wins in a single season. However, the Mariners failed to make it past the [[American League Championship Series]] in either year, and did not make the playoffs for the rest of Gillick's tenure as GM and advisor. 

Like the Blue Jays and Orioles, the Mariners have also not reached the playoffs since his departure as GM.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jake|last=Rake|title=Pat Gillick Rules|work=Rake Blog|date=December 6, 2008|url=http://jakerake.wordpress.com/2008/12/06/pat-gillick-rules|publisher=Wordpress.com}}</ref>

Gillick was inducted into the Toronto Blue Jays "Level of Excellence" on August 8, 2002.

On November 2, 2005, Gillick was named the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]' general manager. Gillick's first big move in Philadelphia was to trade [[Jim Thome]] and cash to the [[Chicago White Sox]] for [[Aaron Rowand]] and prospects [[Gio Gonzalez]] and [[Daniel Haigwood]].  

In June 2006, Gillick faced criticism from members of the media and women's groups for allowing pitcher [[Brett Myers]] to make his scheduled start against the [[Boston Red Sox]] on June 24, 2006, just one day after being arrested for assaulting his wife on a Boston street. Gillick was quoted by [[The New York Times]] as saying "I think it's in the best interest of the club; he's our best pitcher".<ref>{{cite news|first=Lee|last=Jenkins|title=Start Yields Boos for Myers and Criticism for Phillies|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 25, 2006|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/sports/baseball/25myers.html?_r=3&oref=slogin&pagewanted=print}}</ref>

Gillick had permanent residence in Toronto with his wife Doris, but they have since re-located to [[Seattle]] after he became the Phillies GM. He became a Canadian citizen in 2004.

Gillick retired as a GM after leading the Phillies to a World Series championship in 2008. [[Rub<U+00E9>n Amaro, Jr.]] was named his successor. Although he retired from all general manager duties, Gillick decided to remain an advisor to the team.

==Honors and awards==
In 1993, ''Sporting News'' awarded its [[Sporting News#Sportsman of the Year|Sportsman of the Year]] honor to Gillick and Blue Jays manager [[Cito Gaston]].

In 1997, Gillick was inducted into the [[Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame]].

In 2008, baseball fans nationwide voted him the MLB "[[This Year in Baseball Awards]]" Executive of the Year.<ref>'''''Go to''''' [http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/awards/y2008/tyib/index.jsp 2008 This Year in Baseball Awards] '''''and click on''''' "Exec" for results and '''video'''. MLB Advanced Media, L.P. Retrieved 2011-09-05.</ref>

Also in 2008, he was named "[[King of Baseball]]", a ceremonial title awarded by Minor League Baseball to one person each year in recognition of longtime dedication and service to professional baseball.

In December 2009, ''Sports Illustrated'' named him as number 7 on its list of the [[List of 2009 all-decade Sports Illustrated awards and honors #Top 10 GMs/Executives of the Decade|Top 10 GMs/Executives of the Decade]] (in all sports).<ref>The list's only other MLB GMs were Boston's Theo Epstein (No. 3) and Oakland's Billy Beane (No. 10). {{cite web |last=Friedman |first=Dick |title=2000s: Top 10 GMs/Executives |publisher=Sports Illustrated |date=December 22, 2009 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/magazine/specials/2000s/12/19/top.executives/index.html |accessdate=2010-09-23}}</ref>
