'''''Secret Agent Clank''''' is an upcoming [[Platform game|platformer]] developed by [[High Impact Games]] exclusively for the [[PlayStation Portable]] as a spin-off to the ''[[Ratchet & Clank (series)|Ratchet & Clank]]'' series. The game will star [[Clank]] as the main character, playing the role of a secret agent. It is the 7th game in the series (6th chronologically), not including the mobile game.  It is being developed by [[High Impact Games]], known for their other PSP title, ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters]]''. 

As the title suggests, the theme is a spoof of the [[007]] series.  To fit with this theme, he will be wearing a tuxedo throughout the game.  Like the original 007, Clank has an array of helpful gadgets and devices on his tuxedo, such as a [[bow tie]] that he can use as a boomerang, and a rose that he can transform into a monster that eats enemies. 

The concept of a video game sidekick starring in a spin-off is not entirely new (sidekick [[Daxter]] of another Sony mascot duo, ''[[Jak & Daxter]]'', received his own eponymous PSP game in 2006), and Clank has at one point or another in the series been on a television show where he was a secret agent.

== Gameplay ==
{{sectstub}}
Secret Agent Clank will stick with the franchise's blend of the shooting and platforming genres, while also delving deeper into stealth and melee to fit Clank's abilities. For example, the game will feature mini-games where the player must press a sequence of buttons correctly to sneak through an area undetected.<ref name="1up_preview">{{cite web  |url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3162960|author=Jeremy Parish|accessdate=2007-10-15|date=2007-09-19|title=Previews: Secret Agent Clank}}</ref>

Giant Clank, a staple to some games in the series wherein Clank transforms into a monster-sized fighting machine, will also make an appearance; it's been mentioned that he will soar into the sky, manning a new superweapon. (Gameinformer Issue)
