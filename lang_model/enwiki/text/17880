The '''iPod Nano''' ([[trademark]]ed, marketed, and stylized as '''iPod nano''')  [[digital audio player]] designed and marketed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]. The first generation of the iPod Nano was introduced in the end of 2005 as a replacement for the [[iPod mini]].<ref name="firstGenPR">{{Cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/sep/07ipodnano.html |title=Apple Introduces iPod Nano |author=Apple |date=2005-09-07 |work=Apple press release |accessdate=2006-12-23}}</ref> It uses [[flash memory]] for storage. The iPod Nano has gone through six models, or generations, since its introduction. The current "sixth generation" iPod nano supports [[FM radio]], a [[pedometer]], and a {{convert|39.1|mm}} square 240x240 display with a  [[multitouch]] interface.

===History===
Development work on the design of the iPod Nano started only nine months before its launch date.<ref name="StevieWonder">{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1103572,00.html|title=Stevie's Little Wonder|date=2005-09-12|first=Lev|last=Grossman|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2006-10-03}}</ref> The Nano was launched in two colors (black and white) with two available sizes: 2&nbsp;GB (roughly 500 songs) and 4&nbsp;GB (1000 songs).<ref name="firstGenPR" /> On February 7, 2006, Apple updated the lineup with the 1&nbsp;GB model (240 songs).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/feb/07ipod.html|title=Apple Unveils New 1&nbsp;GB iPod Nano at $149|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=2006-02-07|work=Apple press release|accessdate=2006-12-23}}</ref> Apple also released some accessories, including armbands and [[silicone]] "tubes" designed to bring color to the Nano and protect it from scratches, as well as a combination [[lanyard]]-[[earphone]] accessory that hangs around the neck, and avoids the problem of tangled earphone cords.

===Electronics===
The iPod Nano uses general-purpose integrated circuits (IC) instead of smaller, low-cost custom-developed chips, possibly to reduce time-to-market. This design, however, increases the number of electronic components and increases the cost. Japanese engineers estimated the component cost of the 2&nbsp;GB Nano as between [[Japanese yen|JP<U+00A5>]] 22,000 and [[Japanese yen|JP<U+00A5>]] 27,000 ([[United States dollar|US$]] 185-[[United States dollar|US$]] 227),{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} which was high compared to the retail price of JP<U+00A5>21,800 (US$183) at the time.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The cost of 2&nbsp;GB Nano flash memory was about JP<U+00A5>14,000 (US$118).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Apple also opted for the 0603 (1.6x0.8&nbsp;mm) [[surface mount technology]] which was just beginning widespread use in mobile phones in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/HONSHI/20061122/124204/|title=Looking Inside iPod nano, Game Boy Micro|author=Hirotaka Itoh|coauthors=Naoki Asakawa|month=December | year=2005|work=Nikkei Electronics Asia|accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref> The iPod Nano uses a [[PortalPlayer]] PP5021C "system on a chip" with dual embedded 80&nbsp;MHz ARM 7TDMI processors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/consumer_electronics/stats/ipod_nano.html|title=Apple iPod nano 1GB, 2GB, 4GB Specs (MA004LL/A*)|author=EveryMac.com |accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref>

===Reception===

The initial consumer response to the iPod Nano was overwhelmingly positive and sales were heavy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.com.com/2100-1041_3-5858457.html|title=Apple store buzzes with Nano fever|author=Michelle Myers|date=2005-09-10|work=[[CNet]]|accessdate=2005-09-15}}</ref> The Nano sold its first million units in only 17 days, helping [[Apple Inc.]] to a record billion-dollar profit in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1870027,00.asp|title=Apple Hits $1 Billion in Profit for 2005|author=Daniel Drew Turner|date=2005-10-11|work=[[eWeek]]|accessdate=2006-01-03}}</ref>

Apple's release of the [[iPod]] Nano as a replacement for the [[iPod Mini]] was viewed by many as a risky move.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2005/09/ipod_nano_will.html?campaign_id=rss_blog_techbeat|title=iPod nano: Will small size mean big sales?|first=Peter|last=Burrows|date=2005-09-13|work=[[BusinessWeek]]}}</ref> [[Steve Jobs]] has argued that the iPod Nano was a necessary risk since competitors were beginning to catch up to the iPod Mini in terms of design and features, and believed the iPod Nano would prove to be even more popular and successful than the iPod Mini.

Within days of the Nano's release, some users reported damage to the Nano, suggesting that the LCD screen had become so scratched that it was unreadable, even when the backlight was on. Many have reported fine scratches on their Nano caused by microfiber cloths. Other owners reported that their Nano's screen cracked with no provocation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ilounge.com/index.php/news/comments/ipod-Nano-screen-complaints-abound/|title=iPod nano screen complaints abound|first=Larry|last=Angell|date=2005-09-25|work=iLounge|accessdate=2005-09-27}}</ref> On 27 September 2005, Apple confirmed a small percentage ("less than 1/10 of 1 percent") of iPod Nanos shipped with a faulty screen and agreed to replace any Nanos with cracked screens, but denied the iPod Nano was more susceptible to scratching than prior iPods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/news/2005/09/27/nanoscreen/index.php|title=Apple responds to iPod Nano screen concerns|author=Jim Dalrymple|date=2005-09-27|work=[[Macworld]]|accessdate=2005-09-28}}</ref> Apple started shipping iPod Nanos with a protective sleeve to protect them from scratches. In October 2005 a [[class action|class action lawsuit]] was filed against Apple, with the plaintiffs seeking reimbursement for the device, legal fees, and "unlawful or illegal profits" from sales of the iPod Nano. Lawyers for the plaintiffs claim that the devices "scratch excessively during normal usage, rendering the screen on the Nanos unreadable, and violating state consumer protection statutes".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1340|title=iPod Nano owners sue Apple over screen issues|author=Kasper Jade|coauthors=Katie Marshal|date=2005-10-21|work=[[Apple rumors community#AppleInsider|AppleInsider]]|accessdate=2005-10-21}}</ref> Similar lawsuits were later filed in [[Mexico]] and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=2005-11-08|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4417344.stm|title=Nano lawsuit goes international|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2006-05-10}}</ref> As of early 2009, Apple is in the process of settling a court case over the scratched iPod Nano screens, it has been suggested for Apple to set aside $22 million to refund users.

Hesseldahl dismissed them as "stupid" and suggested that they benefitted "no one but the trial lawyers," but also suggested that Apple could have avoided litigation by offering "full refunds on unwanted Nanos" instead of charging a re-stocking fee and lengthening the return period from 14 days (when purchased through Apple retail or online) to 30 or 60 days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2005/tc20051027_665544.htm|title=iPod nano Lawsuits: Who Wins?|first=Arik|last=Hesseldahl|date=2005-10-27|work=[[BusinessWeek]]|accessdate=2005-11-08}}</ref>

===Incidents===
In [[Australia]], an iPod Nano caught fire while being charged on a [[Personal computer|PC]].<ref>[http://www.engadget.com/2007/04/12/exploding-ipod-dies-gruesome-death/ Exploding iPod dies gruesome death], [[Engadget]].</ref><ref>[http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/ipod-Nano-explodes-during-charge-248859.php Gadgets: iPod nano Explodes During Charge], [[Gizmodo]].</ref> Since the limited warranty was over, the consumer was not able to get a replacement right away.

Another iPod incident happened in the [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] while a man was working in the airport.<ref>[http://www.wsbtv.com/news/14271878/detail.html iPod Sets Man's Pants On Fire&nbsp;<U+2013> News Story&nbsp;<U+2013> WSB Atlanta]</ref> His iPod Nano set his trousers on fire. Apple Inc., refused to release a statement regarding this issue.

In addition, an iPod Nano sparked in [[Japan]] in January while it was recharging.<ref>[http://arjunthomas.com/?p=331 iPod nano Sparks Investigation in Japan&nbsp;<U+2013> GridLock&nbsp;<U+2013> Just another KM / Tech Blog]</ref> Although no one was injured during the incident, Apple Inc. investigated the incident.<ref>[http://news.zdnet.com/2110-9584_22-6234041.html iPod nano emits sparks, Japan's government says], Tech News on [[ZDNet]].</ref> It was reported on 19 August 2008 that 17 incidents of abnormal overheating with first-generation iPod Nano units while recharging had been reported in Japan, including cases in which ''[[tatami]]'' mats had been charred.<ref>[http://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/videonews/jnn/20080819/20080819-00000051-jnn-bus_all.html ???iPod?????????17?

==Generations==
===First generation===
[[File:KoolgiyBlackNano.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Black first-generation iPod Nano.]]
Advertising emphasized the iPod Nano's small size: it is {{convert|40|mm}} wide, {{convert|90|mm}} long, {{convert|6.9|mm}} thick and weighs {{convert|42|g}}. Its stated battery life is up to 14 hours. The screen is 176 x 132 pixels, {{convert|38|mm}} diagonal, and can display 65,536 colors ([[Highcolor|16-bit color]]).<ref name="firstGenPR"/>

===Second generation===<!-- This section is linked from [[iPod]] -->
On 12 September 2006, Apple updated the Nano line. The second-generation Nano features scratch-resistant, anodized aluminium casing like the earlier Mini's design; the multiple color choices (silver, green, pink, blue, and black) mirror those of the Mini as well. However, unlike the second-generation Mini, the button labels do not match the color of the Nano. Instead, they are gray, like the first-generation Mini, except for the black iPod which has a black [[click wheel]]. The second-generation Nano features "a brighter, more vibrant display",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/sep/12nano.html|title=Apple Introduces the New iPod Nano|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=2006-09-12|work=Apple press release|accessdate=2006-12-18}}</ref> a battery life upgrade (from 14 to 24 hours), and doubled storage sizes with the new 2, 4, and 8&nbsp;GB models (compared to the previous 1, 2, and 4&nbsp;GB models). The second generation iPod Nanos also support gapless playback of audio files, a new search option, and a 40 percent brighter screen. The 2&nbsp;GB model was available in silver only. The 4&nbsp;GB was initially available in green, blue, silver, or pink. The 8&nbsp;GB model was initially only available in black but [[Product Red]] was later added. Apple claims that the second generation iPod Nano's packaging is "32% lighter and uses 52% less volume than the first generation",<ref>[http://www.apple.com/environment/ Apple&nbsp;<U+2013> Environment]</ref> thereby reducing environmental impact and shipping cost at the same time.

On 13 October 2006, Apple announced a special edition iPod Nano [[Product Red]], with a red exterior and 4&nbsp;GB of storage. For each red iPod Nano sold in the United States, Apple donates US$10 to the Product Red initiative, while retaining the regular price.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/oct/13red.html|title=Apple Announces iPod Nano (PRODUCT) RED Special Edition|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=2006-10-13|work=Apple press release|accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref> On 3 November 2006, Apple introduced a red 8&nbsp;GB model, due to "outstanding customer demand", while also retaining the same price point of the black model with an equally large storage capacity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/nov/03nano.html|title=Apple Announces New 8GB Model of iPod Nano (PRODUCT) RED Special Edition|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=2006-11-03|work=Apple press release|accessdate=2007-01-07}}</ref>

On 26<U+2013>27 December 2006, Apple Computer's website and servers crashed due to people downloading [[iTunes]] software since so many [[iPods]] were sold that Christmas season.

===Third generation===
[[File:ipod nano g3 003.jpg|thumb|left|A black 8&nbsp;GB third generation iPod Nano.]]
Apple updated the Nano again on 5 September 2007. The third-generation Nano featured a {{convert|2|in|mm|sing=on}} [[Quarter Video Graphics Array|QVGA]] (320 x 240) screen and a shorter, wider, heavier design, with new colors. New features included browsing via [[Cover Flow]], a new user interface and video playback. Users had to repurchase games bought before a month prior to the debut of the new iPod as they were not supported. The Nano was announced in a 4&nbsp;GB version coming in silver and an 8&nbsp;GB version coming in silver, turquoise, mint green, black, and [[Product Red]]. The battery lasted for approx. 24 hours on audio playback and approx. 5 hours on video playback. On 22 January 2008, Apple released a pink version of the 8&nbsp;GB iPod Nano.

Combining elements from previous generations of the iPod Nano, the third-generation Nano had an aluminum front plate and a stainless steel back plate. The Nano also sported a new Minimalistic hold switch, similar to the [[iPod Shuffle]]'s power switch, which had been moved to the bottom of the player. The {{convert|2|in|mm|sing=on}} screen had the smallest [[dot pitch]] of any Apple product, having the same pixel count as the {{convert|2.5|in|mm|sing=on}} display of the [[iPod Classic]].

On 6 October 2007, Apple released a [[firmware]] update (1.0.2) via iTunes that was said to improve Cover Flow and yield faster menu navigation.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/10/06/ipod.classic.nano.102/ | title=iPod Classic, Nano updated to 1.0.2 | work=MacNN | date=October 6, 2007 | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> The update was also released for the iPod Classic. On 28 November 2007, Apple released another firmware update (1.0.3) via iTunes, which included unspecified bugfixes. 15 January 2008 saw the release of version 1.1, which added support for iTunes movie rentals, music song lyrics support and included more unspecified bugfixes. In May 2008, Apple released update version 1.1.2 with even more bug fixes.

===Fourth generation===
[[File:IPod Nano 4G black crop.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Fourth generation iPod Nano.]]
At the Apple Let's Rock Event on September 9, 2008, the iPod Nano 4th Generation was officially announced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/09/09/official-ipod-nano-reaches-4g-looks-tall-for-its-age/|title=Official: iPod nano reaches 4G, looks tall for its age|first=Thomas|last=Ricker|date=2008-09-09|work=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref> It returned to the narrow form factor of the 1st and 2nd Generation model, while retaining and rotating the  {{convert|51|mm}} screen from the 3rd gen model. It was also thinner than the 1G, 2G and 3G, measuring {{convert|90.7|mm}} tall by {{convert|38.7|mm}} wide by {{convert|6.2|mm}} thick, and weighing {{convert|36.8|g}}. It had a curved aluminum shell and glass screen (the glass screen being held in place with nothing but the shell). Apple claimed the battery would last 24 hours of music playback, and only 4 hours of video playback, compared to the 5 hours of the previous generation.

The six previous colors (silver, black, mint, turquoise, berry red, and rose pink) were replaced by silver, black, purple, light blue, green, yellow, orange, red, and pink, for a total of nine, although the Product Red color was only available directly from Apple (website and retail stores). Apple marketed the new colors as "nano-chromatic". Also added was an [[accelerometer]] which allows the Nano to shuffle songs by shaking it, the option between portrait and landscape display modes by tilting the iPod left or right, and access to [[Cover Flow]] when tilted sideways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ipod.about.com/od/understandingipodmodels/g/4g_nano.htm |title=Identifying the 4th Generation iPod nano |accessdate=2009-04-29 |publisher=About.com}}</ref> Videos, however, could only be played in landscape mode. The [[user interface]] was also refreshed, adding a more stylized look in keeping with the new hardware design. It included a new voice recording feature which started automatically when an Apple compatible microphone is plugged in. It also included the new "Genius" feature, introduced by Apple the same day. The Genius feature automatically creates playlists based on a selected song using an algorithm built by Apple.

It was additionally touted as "the most environmentally friendly [[iPod]] [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] has ever made", containing [[arsenic]]-free glass and a [[brominated flame retardant|BFR]]-, [[mercury (element)|mercury]]-, and [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]-free design. It was also claimed to be highly [[recycling|recyclable]]. The iPod Nano 4G was shipped in cases similar to the 2G ones with the clear view in the front, and is marketed in two models: 8&nbsp;GB and 16&nbsp;GB. Limited quantities of an unannounced 4&nbsp;GB model surfaced in various markets.<ref name=engadget20080917>{{Cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/09/17/mysterious-new-4gb-ipod-nano-4gs-begin-appearing-on-store-shelve/ |title=Official : Mysterious new 4GB iPod nano 4Gs begin appearing on store shelves|first=Joshua|last=Topolsky|date=2008-09-17 |work=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref> Also, the iPod Quiz game was dropped and replaced with a Maze game which makes use of the iPod's accelerometer similarly to such games on the iPhone and iPod Touch.

The fourth generation dropped support for charging via [[FireWire]]. "This change means that any dock accessories that use the dock connector's FireWire pins to send power<U+2014>many older speakers and car chargers, for example<U+2014>will not charge the 4G iPod Nano."<ref name=pcworld09162008>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/151113/fourthgeneration_ipod_nano.html |title=Fourth-generation iPod Nano |first=Dan|last=Frakes|date=2008-09-16 |work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]}}</ref>

===Fifth generation===
[[File:IPod-nano-5G-camera-view-1.png|thumb|right|150px|Fifth-generation iPod Nano camera and microphone.]]
At Apple's September 9, 2009 event, a fifth generation iPod Nano was unveiled with reduced prices on the larger model (at the time of release, the 8GB was priced at $149 and the 16GB at $179), a larger, {{convert|56.3|mm}} diagonal screen (up from {{convert|50.8|mm}} in third and fourth generation iPod Nanos), which is also wider,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> integrated [[video camera]] with 16 special effects, [[microphone]], [[FM Radio]] with [[iTunes|iTunes tagging]] (via [[Radio Data System|RDS]]) multiple radio regions including Americas, Asia, Australia, Europe, and Japan.

It also includes Live Pause, a built-in pedometer, [[Nike+iPod|Nike+iPod Support]] and [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] (features more anticipated with the [[iPod Touch]]).<ref name="ReferenceA">[http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/features/ iPod nano new features]</ref><ref name="ReferenceB">{{Cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/itunes/tagging/ |title=iTunes - Partner with iTunes |publisher=Apple |date= |accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref>

The headphone jack and [[Dock connector#iPod dock connector|dock connector]] swapped locations so that the headphone jack is now to the left of the dock connector. Therefore the fifth generation iPod Nano uses a different Apple Universal Dock insert than the fourth generation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1380 |title=Learn about Apple Universal Dock |publisher=Support.apple.com |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref>

The fifth generation iPod Nano has nine finishes: Silver, Black, Purple, Blue, Yellow, Orange, Product Red, Green and Pink.  All have a glossier, shinier finish than the fourth generation. Just like the 4G iPod Nano, Product Red and the yellow Nano are only available on the Apple Online Store and Apple Retail Store . {{-}}

===Sixth generation===
At a media event on September 1, 2010, Apple announced the sixth generation iPod Nano, which among many new features, will be designed around a high resolution "square shaped" touch-screen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100901/ap_on_hi_te/us_tec_apple |title=Apple unveils new TV box for renting movies, shows - Yahoo!

The device now features a smaller 1.54&nbsp;inch [[multi-touch]] screen with a lower resolution of 240x240 [[pixel]]s but a higher pixel density of 220 [[pixels per inch]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPod-Nano-6th-Generation-Teardown/3563/1 |title=iFixit - iPod Nano 6th Generation Teardown: Page 1 |publisher=iFixit  |date=2010-09-08 |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref>, as opposed to the larger, brighter{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} 2.2&nbsp;inch screen on the iPod nano 5G.

The device retains the same 30-pin dock connector as previous generations. The new iPod Nano has lost the previous generation's video camera, built-in voice recorder (although plugging in headphones with a built in microphone will reveal a Voice Memos app) and built-in speaker, and games. It has also lost support for video playback<ref name="apple.com"/>, but music videos and video podcasts (vodcasts) can be synced onto the device, and the audio from them will play on the device, with a single key-frame shown on the screen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/news/comments/ipod-nano-6g-plays-music-videos-vodcasts-as-audio/ |title=iLounge.com - iPod nano 6G plays music videos, vodcasts as audio |publisher=iLounge.com |lastname=Starrett |firstname=Charles |date=2010-09-09 |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref> It still includes the Nike+iPod fitness option as well as an [[FM radio]] tuner. It has a black on white screen contrast option and other accessibility options. The 6th generation iPod nano has the same price point as the 5th generation device.
