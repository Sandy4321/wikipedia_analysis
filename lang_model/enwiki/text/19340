[[File:Maldivesfish2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The fish that inhabit [[coral reef]]s are numerous and diverse]]

'''Coral reef fish''' are [[fish]] which live amongst or in close relation to [[coral reef]]s. Coral reefs form complex [[ecosystem]]s with tremendous [[biodiversity]]. Among the myriad inhabitants, the fish stand out as particularly colourful and interesting to watch. Hundreds of species can exist in a small area of a healthy reef, many of them hidden or well camouflaged. Reef fish have developed many ingenious specialisations adapted to survival on the reefs.

Coral reefs occupy less than one percent of the surface area of the world oceans, yet they provide a home for 25 percent of all marine fish species. Reef habitats are a sharp contrast to the open water habitats that make up the other 99% of the world oceans.

However, loss and degradation of coral reef habitat, increasing [[Marine pollution|pollution]], and [[overfishing]] including the use of [[destructive fishing practices]], are threatening the survival of the coral reefs and the associated reef fish.

==Overview==
[[File:Orange-lined Triggerfish3.jpg|thumb|300px|right|In the foreground is an [[orange-lined triggerfish]] displaying spines. [[Triggerfish]] have mouths that crush shells. Orange-lined triggerfish are particularly aggressive. The black and white fish are [[three-stripe damsel]]fish and the smaller fish are [[Chromis viridis|blue-green chromis]] damselfish. If the triggerfish attacks, the damselfish will hide in the nearby [[pillar coral]]. If the triggerfish wants to hide, it will squeeze into a coral crevice and lock itself in place with  its spines.]]
 
[[Coral reef]]s are the result of millions of years of [[coevolution]] among algae, invertebrates and fish. They have become crowded and complex environments, and the fish have evolved many ingenious ways of surviving.<ref name=MoyleCech555>Moyle and Cech, 2003, p. 555.</ref>

Most fishes found on coral reefs are [[ray-finned fishes]], known for the characteristic sharp, bony rays and spines in their fins.<ref name=MoyleCech555 /> These spines provide formidable defences, and when erected they can usually be locked in place or are [[venomous fish|venomous]]. Many reef fish have also evolved [[cryptic coloration]] to confuse predators.<ref name=MoyleCech561>Moyle and Cech, 2003, p. 561.</ref>

Reef fish have also evolved complex [[Adaptive behavior (ecology)|adaptive behaviours]]. Small reef fish get protection from predators by hiding in reef crevices or by [[shoaling and schooling]]. Many reef fish confine themselves to one small neighbourhood where every hiding place is known and can be immediately accessed. Others cruise the reefs for food in shoals, but return to a known area to hide when they are inactive.  Resting small fish are still vulnerable to attack by crevice predators, so many fish, such as [[triggerfish]], squeeze into a small hiding place and wedge themselves by erecting their spines.<ref name=MoyleCech561 />

As an example of the adaptations made by reef fish, the [[yellow tang]] is a [[herbivore]] which feeds on benthic turf algae. They also provide cleaner services to marine turtles, by removing algal growth from their shells. They do not tolerate other fish with the same colour or shape. When alarmed, the usually placid yellow tang can erect spines in its tail and slash at its opponent with rapid sideways movements.

==Diversity and distribution==
[[File:Reef building corals.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Distribution of coral reefs]]

[[Coral reef]]s contain the most diverse fish assemblages to be found anywhere on earth, with perhaps as many as 6,000-8,000 species that can be found dwelling within coral reef ecosystems of the world's oceans.<ref name=LiskeMyers>Liske and Myers, 2001.</ref>  

The mechanisms that first led to, and continue to maintain, such concentrations of fish species on coral reefs has been widely debated over the last 50 years.  While many reasons have been proposed, there is no general scientific consensus on which of these is the most influential, but it seems likely that a number of factors contribute.  These include the rich habitat complexity and diversity inherent in coral reef ecosystems,<ref>Analysis of the influence of substrate variables on coral reef fish communities.  Luckhurst, B.E. and K. Luckhurst, 1978.</ref><ref>Similarity and Diversity Among Coral Reef Fish Communities: A Comparison between Tropical Western Atlantic (Virgin Islands) and Tropical Central Pacific (Marshall Islands) Patch Reefs. Gladfelter et. al. 1980</ref> the wide variety and temporal availability of food resources available to coral reef fishes,<ref>Food Habits of Reef Fishes of the West Indies, Randall, J.E. 1967</ref> a host of pre and post larval settlement processes,<ref>[http://www.marinebiology.org/fishecology.htm Coral Reef Fish Ecology], Buchheim, J.</ref> and as yet unresolved interactions between all these factors.

There are two major regions of coral reef development recognized; the Indo-Pacific (which includes the Pacific and Indian Oceans as well as the Red Sea), and the tropical western Atlantic (also known as the "wider" or "greater" Caribbean).  Each of these two regions contains its own unique coral reef fish fauna with no natural overlap in species.  Of the two regions, the richest by far in terms of reef fish diversity is the Indo-Pacific where there are an estimated 4,000-5,000 species of fishes associated with coral reef habitats.  Another 500-700 species can be found in the greater Caribbean region.<ref name=LiskeMyers />

==Reef fish adaptations==

===Body shape===
[[File:Holacanthus ciliaris 1.jpg|thumb|left|Many reef fish, like this [[queen angelfish]], have a body flattened like a pancake, with pectoral and pelvic fins that act with the flattened body to maximize manoeuvrability.]]
[[Image:Bluefin-big.jpg|thumb|right|[[Epipelagic fish|Open water fish]], like this [[Northern bluefin tuna]], are usually streamlined for speed, with a deeply forked tail and a smooth body shaped like a spindle tapered at both ends. They are [[countershading|countershaded]] with silvery colours.]]

Most reef fishes have body shapes that are different from open water fishes. Open water fishes are usually built for speed in the open sea, streamlined like torpedoes to minimise friction as they move through the water. Reef fish are operating in the relatively confined spaces and complex underwater landscapes of coral reefs. For this manoeuvrability is more important than straight line speed, so coral reef fish have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction. They outwit predators by dodging into fissures in the reef or playing hide and seek around coral heads.<ref name=Alevizon>Alevizon WS (1994) [http://www.amazon.com/Pisces-Guide-Caribbean-Reef-Ecology/dp/1559920777 "Pisces Guide to Caribbean Reef Ecology"]  Gulf Publishing Company ISBN: 1559920777 </ref>

Many reef fish, such as [[butterflyfish]] and [[Marine angelfish group|angelfishes]], have evolved bodies which are deep and laterally compressed like a pancake. Their pelvic and pectoral fins are designed differently, so they act together with the flattened body to optimise manoeuvrability.<ref name=Alevizon />

===Colouration===
[[File:Synchiropus splendidus 2 Luc Viatour cropped.png|thumb|260px|right|The psychedelic [[mandarinfish]] is one of only two animal species known to have blue colouring because of cellular pigment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goda, M.; R. Fujii |year=2009 |title=Blue Chromatophores in Two Species of Callionymid Fish |journal=Zoological Science |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=811-813 |doi=10.2108/zsj.12.811}}</ref> They are not easily seen due to their bottom-feeding habit and their small size, reaching only about 6 cm. They feed primarily on small crustaceans and other invertebrates, and are popular in the aquarium trade.]]

Coral reef fishes exhibit a huge variety of dazzling and sometimes bizarre colours and patterns. This is in marked contrasts to open water fishes which are usually [[countershading|countershaded]] with silvery colours.

The patterns have different functions. Sometimes they camouflage the fish when the fish rests in places with the right background. Colouration can also be used to help species recognition during mating. Some unmistakable contrasting patterns are used to warn predators that the fish has venomous spines or poisonous flesh.<ref name=Alevizon />

The [[foureye butterflyfish]] gets its name from a large dark spot on the rear portion of each side of the body. This spot is surrounded by a brilliant white ring, resembling an [[Eyespot (mimicry)|eyespot]]. A black vertical bar on the head runs through the true eye, making it hard to see.<ref>[[FishBase]]}}{{FishBase_species |genus=Chaetodon |species=capistratus |year=2009 |month=July}}</ref> This can result in a [[predator]] thinking the fish is bigger than it is, and confusing the back end with the front end. The butterflyfish's first instinct when threatened is to flee, putting the false eyespot closer to the predator than the head.  Most predators aim for the eyes, and this false eyespot tricks the predator into believing that the fish will flee tail first. When escape is not possible, the butterflyfish will sometimes turn to face its aggressor, head lowered and spines fully erect, like a bull about to charge.  This may serve to intimidate the other animal or may remind the predator that the butterflyfish is too spiny to make a comfortable meal.

Just as some prey species evolved cryptic colouration and patterns to help avoid predators, some [[ambush predator]]s evolved camouflage that lets them ambush their prey. The [[tassled scorpionfish]] is an ambush predator that looks like part of a sea floor encrusted with coral and algae. It lies in wait on the sea floor for crustaceans and small fish, such as gobies, to pass by.<ref name=PBS />

[[Gobies]] avoid predators by tucking themselves into coral crevices or partly burying themselves in sand. They continually scan for predators with eyes that swivel independently. The camouflage of the tassled scorpionfish can prevent gobies from seeing them until it's too late.<ref name=PBS />

==Feeding strategies==
Many reef fish species have evolved different feeding strategies accompanied by specialized mouths, jaws and teeth particularly suited to deal with their primary food sources found in coral reef ecosystems. This is not surprising, given the huge variety in the types of prey on offer around coral reefs.<ref name=Alevizon />

For example, the primary food source of [[butterflyfish]]es are the coral [[pol]]yps themselves or the appendages of [[polychaete]]s and other small invertebrate animals. Their mouths protrude like forceps, and are equipped with fine teeth that allow them to nip off such exposed body parts of their prey. [[Parrotfish]]es eat [[algae]] growing on reef surfaces, utilizing mouths like beaks well adapted to scrape off their food. Other fish, like [[Lutjanidae|snapper]], are generalized feeders with more standard jaw and mouth structures that allow them to forage on a wide range of animal prey types, including small fishes and invertebrates.<ref name=Alevizon />

===Generalized carnivores===
[[File:RedSnapper.jpg|thumb|right|[[Red snapper (fish)|Red snapper]], are generalized reef feeders with standard jaw and mouth structures that allow them to eat almost anything, though they prefer small fish and [[crustacean]]s]]

[[Carnivore]]s are the most diverse of feeding types among coral reef fishes. There are many more carnivore species on the reefs than [[herbivore]]s. Competition among carnivores is intense, resulting in a treacherous environment for their prey. Hungry predators lurk in ambush or patrol every part of the reef, night and  day.<ref name=PBS3>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/survival/coral/partners.html Coral Reef Connections: Partners] US [[Public Broadcasting Service]]. Retrieved 16 January 2010.</ref>

Some fishes associated with reefs are generalized carnivores that feed on a variety of animal prey. These typically have large mouths that can be rapidly expanded, thereby drawing in nearby water and any unfortunate animals contained within the inhaled water mass. The water is then expelled through the gills with the mouth closed, thereby trapping the helpless prey<ref name=Alevizon /> For example, the [[bluestripe snapper]] has a varied [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]], feeding on [[fish]]es, [[shrimp]]s, [[crab]]s, [[stomatopod]]s, [[cephalopod]]s and [[planktonic]] [[crustaceans]], as well as [[plant]] and [[algae]] material. Diet varies with age, location and the prevalent prey items locally.<ref name = "AllenFAO">{{cite book | last = Allen | first = G.R. | title = FAO Species Catalogue Vol. 6: Snappers of the World; An Annotated and Illustrated Catalogue of Lutjanid Species Known to Date | publisher = FAO | date = 1985 | location = Rome | pages = 207 | url = http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/ac481e/ac481e00.htm | isbn = 92-5-102321-2 }}</ref>

[[Goatfish]] are tireless [[benthic]] feeders, using a pair of long [[chemosensory]] [[barbel (anatomy)|barbel]]s (whiskers) protruding from their chins to rifle through the sediments in search of a meal. Like goats, they seek anything edible: [[worm]]s, [[crustacea]]ns, [[mollusc]]s and other small [[invertebrate]]s are staples.<ref name=EoF>{{cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R. & Eschmeyer, W.N.|author= Johnson, G.D. & Gill, A.C.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 186|isbn= 0-12-547665-5}}</ref> The yellowfin goatfish (''Mulloidichthys vanicolensis'') often schools with the blue-striped snapper. The yellowfins change their colouration to match that of the snapper. Presumably this is for predator protection, since goatfish are a more preferred prey than bluestripe snapper. By night the schools disperse and individual goatfish head their separate ways to loot the sands. Other nocturnal feeders shadow the active goatfish, waiting patiently for overlooked morsels.

[[Moray eel]]s and coral groupers (''Plectropomus pessuliferus'') are known to cooperate with each other when hunting.<ref>[http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040431  Interspecific Communicative and Coordinated Hunting between Groupers and Giant Moray Eels in the Red Sea]</ref> [[Grouper]] are [[protogynous]] [[hermaphrodite]]s, who school in ''[[Harem (zoology)|harems]]'' of three to fifteen females. When no male is available, the most aggressive and largest females shift sex to male, probably as a result of behavioural triggers.

===Specialised carnivores===
Large [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]] of [[forage fish]], such as [[surgeonfish]] and [[cardinalfish]], move around the reef feeding on tiny [[zooplankton]]. The forage fish are, in turn, eaten by larger fish, such as the bigeye trevally. Fish receive many benefits from [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling behaviour]], including defence against predators through better predator detection, since each fish is on the lookout. Schooling fish have developed remarkable displays of precise choreography which confuse and evade predators. For this they have have evolved special pressure sensors along their sides, called [[lateral line]]s, that let them feel each other's movements and stay synchronized."<ref name=PBS />

[[Bigeye trevally]] also form schools. They are swift predators who patrol the reef in hunting packs. When they find a school of forage fish, such as cardinalfish, they surround them and herd them close to the reef. This panics the prey fish, and their schooling becomes chaotic, keaving them open to attack by the trevallie.<ref name=PBS>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/survival/coral/predators.html Coral Reef Connections: Predators and Prey] US [[Public Broadcasting Service]]. Retrieved 16 January 2010.</ref>

The [[titan triggerfish]] can move relatively large rocks when feeding and is often followed by smaller fishes that feed on leftovers. They also use a jet of water to uncover [[sand dollar]]s buried in sand.

[[Barracuda]] are ferocious predators on other fishes, with razor-sharp conical teeth which make it easy for them to rip their prey to shreds. Barracuda patrol the outer reef in large schools, and are extremely fast swimmers with streamlined, torpedo-shaped bodies.<ref name=PBS />

[[Porcupinefish]] are medium to large sized, and are usually found swimming among or near coral reefs. They inflate their body by swallowing water, reducing potential predators to those with much bigger mouths.

Fish can't groom themselves. Some fish specialise as [[cleaner fish]], and establish [[cleaning station]]s where other fish can come to have their parasites nibbled away. The "resident fish doctor and dentist on the reef is the [[bluestreak cleaner wrasse]]".<ref name=PBS3 /> The bluestreak is marked with a conspicuous bright blue stripe and behaves in a stereotypical way which attracts larger fish to its cleaning station. As the bluestreak snacks on the parasites it gently tickles its client. This seems to bring the larger fish back again for regular servicing.<ref name=PBS3 />

The [[Synodus variegatus|reef lizardfish]] secretes a mucus coating which reduces drag when they swim and also protects it from some parasites. But other parasites find the mucus itself good to eat. So lizardfish visit the cleaner wrasse, which clean the parasites from the skin, gills and mouth.<ref name=PBS3 />

===Herbivores===
[[File:Maldives Surgeonfish, Acanthurus leucosternon.jpg|thumb|260px|right|[[Surgeonfish]] are among the most common of coral reef [[herbivore]]s, often feeding in [[Shoaling and schooling|shoals]]. This may be a mechanism for overwhelming the highly aggressive defence responses of small territorial [[damselfish]]es that vigorously guard small patches of algae on coral reefs.<ref name=Alevizon1976>Mixed schooling and its possible significance in a tropical western Atlantic parrotfish and surgeonfish. WS Alevizon, Copeia 1976:797-798.</ref>]]

[[Herbivore]]s feed on plants. The four largest groups of coral reef fishes that feed on plants are the [[parrotfish]]es, [[damselfish]]es, [[rabbitfish]]es, and [[surgeonfish]]es. All feed primarily on [[microscopic]] and [[macroscopic]] [[algae]] growing on or near coral reefs.

[[Algae]] can drape reefs in kaleidoscopes of colour and form. Algae are [[primary producers]],  which means they are plants synthesising food directly from solar energy and carbon dioxide and other simple nutrient molecules. Without algae, everything on the reef would die. One important algal group, the bottom dwelling ([[benthic]]) algae, grows over dead coral and other inert surfaces, and provides grazing fields for [[herbivore]]s such as parrotfish.<ref name=PBS>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/survival/coral/predators.html Coral Reef Connections: Predators and Prey] US [[Public Broadcasting Service]]. Retrieved 16 January 2010.</ref>

[[Parrotfish]] are named for their parrot-like beaks and bright colours. They are large herbivores that graze on the algae that grows on hard dead corals. Equipped with two pairs of crushing jaws and their beaks, they pulverize chunks of algae-coated coral, digesting the algae and excreting the coral as fine sand.<ref name=PBS />

Smaller parrotfish are relatively defenceless herbivores, poorly defended against predators like barracuda. They have evolved to find protection by schooling, sometimes with other species like [[Shoaling and schooling|shoaling]] [[rabbitfish]]. Spinefoot rabbitfish are named for their defensive venomous spines, and they are seldom attacked by predators. Spines are a last ditch defence. It is better to to avoid predator detection in the first place, and avoid being thrust into risky spine-to-fang battles. So rabbitfish have also evolved skilful colour changing abilities.<ref name=PBS3 />

[[Damselfish]] are a group of species that feed on [[zooplankton]] and algae, and are an important reef [[forage fish]] for larger predators. They are small, typically five centimetres (two inches) long. Many species are aggressive towards other fishes which also graze on algae, such as [[surgeonfish]]. Surgeonfish sometimes use schooling as a countermeasure to solitary damselfish defensive attacks <ref name=Alevizon1976 />

==Symbiosis==
[[Image:Hawkfish.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A [[hawkfish]] safely perched on [[fire coral]] surveys its surroundings]]

[[Symbiosis]] refers to two species that have a close relationship with each other. The relationship can be [[mutualistic]], when both species benefit from the relationship, [[Commensalism|commensalistic]], when one species benefits and the other is unaffected, and [[Parasitism|parasitistic]], when one species benefits, and the other is harmed.

An example of commensalism occurs between the [[hawkfish]] and [[fire coral]]. Thanks to their large, skinless pectoral fins, hawkfish can perch on fire corals without harm. Fire corals are not true [[coral]]s, but are [[hydrozoa]]ns possessing stinging cells called [[nematocyst]]s which would normally prevent close contact. The protection fire corals offer hawkfish means the hawkfish has the high ground of the reef, and can safely survey its surroundings like a [[hawk]]. Hawkfish usually stay motionless, but dart out and grab [[crustacean]]s and other small [[invertebrate]]s as they pass by. They are mostly solitary, although some species form pairs and share a head of coral.

A more bizarre example of commensalism occurs between the slim, eel-shaped pinhead [[pearlfish]] and a particular species of [[sea cucumber]]. The pearlfish enters the sea cucumber through its anus, and spends the day safely protected inside the seacucumbers [[alimentary tract]]. At night it emerges the same way and feeds on small crustaceans.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/448066/pearlfish Pearlfish] (2010). In Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica. Retrieved January 30, 2010.</ref>

}}
[[Sea anemone]]s are common on reefs. The [[tentacle]]s of sea anemones bristle with tiny harpoons ([[nematocyst]]s) primed with [[toxin]]s, and are an effective deterrent against most predators. However, [[saddle butterflyfish]], which are up to 30 cm (12 in) long, have developed a resistance to these toxins. Saddle butterflyfish usually flutter gently rather than swim. But in the presence of their preferred food, sea anemones, this gentleness disappears, and the butterflyfish dash in and out, ripping off the anemone tentacles.<ref name=PBS /> 

However, there is a mutualistic relationship between sea anemones and [[clownfish]]. This gives the sea anemones a second line of defence. They are guarded by fiercely territorial [[clownfish]], who are also immune to the anemone toxins. To get their meal, butterflyfish must get past these protective clownfish who, although smaller, are not intimidated. An anemone without its clownfish will quickly be eaten by butterflyfish.<ref name=PBS /> In return, the anemones provide the clownfish protection from their predators, who are not immune to anemone stings. As a further benefit to the anemone, waste [[ammonia]] from the clownfish feed [[symbiotic]] [[algae]] found in the anemone's tentacles.<ref>Porat, D. & Chadwick-Furman, N.

==Toxicity==
[[File:Pterois volitans Manado-e edit.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Head on view of the beautiful [[lionfish]], a venomous coral reef fish<ref>{{FishBase_species |genus=Pterois |species=volitans |year=2009 |month=July}}</ref>]]

Many reef fish are toxic. Toxic fish are fish which contain strong [[toxin]]s in their bodies. There is a distinction between [[Venom#Venomous vs. poisonous|poisonous fish]] and [[venomous fish]]. Both types of fish contain strong toxins, but the difference is in the way the toxin is delivered. Venomous fish deliver their toxins (called [[venom]]) by biting, stinging, or stabbing, causing an [[envenomation]]. Venomous fish don't necessarily cause poisoning if they are eaten, since the venom is often destroyed in the digestive system. By contrast, poisonous fish contain strong toxins which are not destroyed by the digestive system. This makes them poisonous to eat.<ref name="Biosearch">[http://www.greatbarrierreefs.com.au/biobits/biobits_venomous.htm Poisonous vs. Venomous fish: What<U+2019>s the difference?] Reef Biosearch.

Venomous fish carry their venom in venom glands and use various delivery systems, such as spines or sharp fins, barbs or spikes, and fangs. Venomous fish tend to be either very visible, using flamboyant colours to warn enemies, or skilfully camouflaged and maybe buried in the sand. Apart from the defence or hunting value, venom might have value for bottom dwelling fish by killing the bacteria that try to invade their skin. Few of these venoms have been studied. They are a yet to be tapped resource for [[bioprospecting]] to find drugs with medical uses.<ref name="Grady">Grady, Denise [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/22/science/22fish.html?ei=5094&en=3d2f666379306107&hp=&ex=1156219200&partner=homepage&pagewanted=print Venom Runs Thick in Fish Families, Researchers Learn] ''[[New York Times]]'' 22 August 2006.</ref>

The most venomous known fish is the [[reef stonefish]].<ref name="ReferenceC"/><ref name="petplace.com"/> It has a remarkable ability to camouflage itself amongst rocks. It is an [[ambush predator]] that sits on the bottom waiting for prey to come close. It does not swim away if disturbed, but erects 13 venomous spines along its back. For defence, it can shoot venom from each or all of these spines. Each spine is like a hypodermic needle, delivering the venom from two sacs attached to the spine. The stonefish has control over whether to shoot its venom, and does so when provoked or frightened.<ref name="Grady"/> The venom results in severe pain, paralysis and tissue death, and can be fatal if not treated. Despite its formidable defence, the stonefish does have predators. Some bottom feeding rays and sharks with crushing teeth feed on them, as does the [[Astrotia stokesii|Stokes' seasnake]]<ref>[http://australianmuseum.net.au/Reef-Stonefish-Synanceia-verrucosa-Bloch-Schneider-1801 Reef Stonefish, Synanceia verrucosa (Bloch & Schneider, 1801)] [[Australian Museum]].

Unlike the stonefish which can shoot venom, the [[lionfish]] can only release venom when something strikes its spines. Although not native to the US coast, lionfish have appeared around Florida and have spread up the coast to New York. They are attractive aquarium fish, sometimes used to stock ponds, and may have been washed into the sea during a hurricane. Lionfish can aggressively dart at scuba divers and attempt to puncture the facemask with their venomous spines.<ref name="Grady"/> 

The [[spotted trunkfish]] is a reef fish which secretes a colourless [[ciguatera]] toxin from glands on its skin when touched. The toxin is only dangerous when ingested, so there's no immediate harm to divers. However, predators as large as [[nurse sharks]] can die as a result of eating a trunkfish.<ref>{{FishBase_species|genus=Lactophrys|species=bicaudalis|year=2009|month=July}}</ref>   Ciguatera toxins appear to accumulate in top predators of coral reefs.  Many of the Caribbean groupers and the barracuda for example may contain enough of this toxin to cause severe symptoms in humans who eat them.  What makes the situation particularly dangerous is that such species may be toxic only at certain sizes or locations, making it difficult to know when they are or are not safe to eat. This leads to many cases of ciguatera poisoning among islanders in certain locations <ref>[http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/groups/niehs/science/ciguatera.htm  Ciguatera]. "Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, Univ. of Miami"</ref>

The [[stargazer]] buries itself in sand and can deliver electric shocks as well as venom. It is a delicacy in some cultures (the venom is destroyed when it is cooked), and can be found for sale in some [[fish market]]s with the electric organ removed. They have been called "the meanest things in creation"<ref name="Grady"/>

The [[giant moray]] is a reef fish at the top of the [[food chain]]. Like many other apex reef fish, it is likely to cause [[ciguatera]] poisoning if eaten.<ref>Lieske, E. and Myers, R.F.

==Reef sharks and rays==
[[File:Triaenodon obesus moc.jpg|thumb|260px|right|alt=Photo of a swimming whitetip reef shark, facing three-quarters towards the camera|The [[whitetip reef shark]] almost exclusively inhabits coral reefs]]

Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific are dominated by [[whitetip reef shark|whitetip]], [[blacktip reef shark|blacktip]] and [[grey reef shark]]. Coral reefs in the western [[Atlantic Ocean]] are dominated by the [[Caribbean reef shark]]. These sharks are all species of [[requiem shark]], and all have the robust, streamlined bodies that are typical of the requiem shark. They are fast-swimming, agile predators that feed primarily on free-swimming bony fishes and cephalopods. Other species of reef sharks include the [[Galapagos shark]], the [[tawny nurse shark]] and [[hammerhead shark|hammerheads]].   

The [[whitetip reef shark]] is a small shark usually less than {{convert|1.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length. It is associated almost exclusively with coral reefs where it can be encountered around coral heads and ledges with high vertical relief, or over sandy flats, in [[lagoon]]s, or near drop-offs to deeper water.<ref name="hobson">{{cite journal |author=Hobson, E.S. |date=1963 |title=Feeding Behavior in Three Species of Sharks |journal=Pacific Science |volume=17 |pages=171&ndash;194}}</ref> They prefer very clear water and rarely swim far from the bottom.<ref name="randall">{{cite journal |author=Randall, J.E. |title=Contribution to the Biology of the Whitetip Reef Shark (''Triaenodon obesus'') |journal=Pacific Science |date=1977 |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=143&ndash;164}}</ref> Whitetip reef sharks spend most of the daytime time resting inside caves. Unlike other requiem sharks, which usually rely on ram ventilation and must constantly swim to breathe, this shark can pump water over its [[gill]]s and lie still on the bottom. They have slender, lithe body, which allows them to wriggle into crevices and holes and extract prey inaccessible to other reef sharks. On the other hand, they are rather clumsy when attempting to take food suspended in open water.<ref name="randall"/> 

[[Image:Triaenodon obesus guam.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Three gray sharks lying beside each other on the sea bottom.|Whitetip reef sharks spend much of the day lying still on the bottom.]]

The whitetip reef shark does not frequent very shallow water like the blacktip reef shark, nor the outer reef like the grey reef shark.<ref name="compagno"/> They generally remain within a highly localized area. An individual shark may use the same cave for months to years. The daytime [[home range]] of a whitetip reef shark is limited to about {{convert|0.05|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, and at night this range increases to {{convert|1|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="martin"/> 

The whitetip reef shark is highly responsive to [[olfaction|olfactory]], [[acoustics|acoustic]], and electrical cues given off by potential prey. Its visual system is attuned more to movement and/or contrast than to object details.<ref name="hobson"/><ref>Nelson, D.R. and R.H. Johnson. (1970).

After dusk, a group of sharks may target the same prey item, covering every exit route from a particular coral head. Each shark hunts for itself and in competition with the others in its group.<ref name="hobson"/> They feed mainly on bony fishes, including [[eel]]s, [[squirrelfish]]es, [[Lutjanidae|snapper]]s, [[damselfish]]es, [[parrotfish]]es, [[surgeonfish]]es, [[triggerfish]]es, and [[goatfish]]es, as well as [[octopus]], [[spiny lobster]]s, and [[crab]]s.<ref name="compagno"/> Important predators of the whitetip reef shark include [[tiger shark]]s and [[Galapagos shark]]s.

[[File:Shark - opening.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A shark swimming parallel to a reef ledge in the foreground, with many smaller fish nearby|Adult [[blacktip reef shark]]s are often found patrolling reef ledges.]]

The [[blacktip reef shark]] is  typically about {{convert|1.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. It is usually found over reef ledges and sandy flats, though it can also enter [[brackish]] and [[freshwater]] environments. This species likes shallow water, while the [[whitetip reef shark|whitetip]] and the [[grey reef shark]] are prefer deeper water. Younger sharks favour shallow sandy flats, and older sharks spend more time around reef ledges and near reef drop-offs. Blacktip reef sharks are strongly attached to their own area, where they may remain for up to several years.<ref name="papastamatiou et al">{{cite journal |title=Distribution, size frequency, and sex ratios of blacktip reef sharks ''Carcharhinus melanopterus'' at Palmyra Atoll: a predator-dominated ecosystem |author=Papastamatiou, Y.P., J.E.

However, they are social rather than territorial. During the day, these sharks often form groups of 5<U+2013>20 individuals near coral reef drop-offs, splitting up in the evening as the sharks begin to hunt. They are found over continental and insular shelves, preferring the leeward (away from the direction of the current) sides of coral reefs with clear water and rugged topography. They are frequently found near the drop-offs at the outer edges of the reef, and less commonly within [[lagoon]]s.

The [[Caribbean reef shark]] is up to 3 metres (10 ft) long, one of the largest [[apex predator]]s in the reef [[ecosystem]]. Like the whitetip reef shark, they have been documented resting motionless on the sea bottom or inside caves, unusual behaviour for requiem sharks.
