'''West Bromwich Albion Football Club''' (also known as '''West Brom''', '''The Baggies''', '''Albion''', '''The Albion''', '''The Throstles''' or '''W.B.A.''') are an [[England|English]] professional [[Football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[West Bromwich]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]]. As of the [[2007-08 in English football|2007&ndash;08]] season, the team plays in the [[Football League Championship]],  the second tier of English football, although they have competed in the top-flight for the majority of their existence.<!--The latter will remain true until at least 2042--> The club was formed in 1878 by workers from Salter's Spring Works in West Bromwich, and have played their home games at [[The Hawthorns]] since [[1900 in football (soccer)|1900]].

Albion were one of the founding members of [[The Football League]] in [[1888 in football (soccer)|1888]] but have won the league title only once, in [[1919-20 in English football|1919&ndash;20]].  They have had more success in the [[FA Cup]], with five wins.  The first came in [[FA Cup Final 1888|1888]], the year the league was founded, and the most recent in [[FA Cup Final 1968|1968]], their last major trophy. They also won the [[Football League Cup]] at the first attempt in [[1966 Football League Cup Final|1966]]. Since the early 1980s the club has been less successful. From 1986 to 2002 they spent their longest ever period out of the top division, although there has been something of a revival in recent years, with three seasons spent in the [[Premier League|Premiership]] between 2002 and 2006.

:''For a statistical breakdown by season, see [[West Bromwich Albion F.C. seasons]]''
The club was founded as '''West Bromwich Strollers''' in 1878 by workers from [[Avery Berkel|George Salter's Spring Works]] in West Bromwich, then in [[Staffordshire]] but now part of the West Midlands administrative county.<ref>Older sources quote the year of formation as 1879, as evidence of a Strollers match from 1878 came to light only as recently as 1993.</ref><ref name="Early years">McOwan pp7&ndash;10.</ref> They were renamed West Bromwich Albion in 1880, becoming the first team to adopt the ''[[Albion (disambiguation)#Football and rugby|Albion]]'' suffix.

They reached the quarter-finals, beating several longer-established clubs on the way.  In 1883, Albion won their first trophy, the [[Staffordshire Senior Cup|Staffordshire Cup]]. Albion joined [[the Football Association]] in the same year; this enabled them to enter the FA Cup for the first time in the [[1883-84 in English football|1883&ndash;84]] season.<ref>McOwan pp13&ndash;14.</ref> In [[1885 in football (soccer)|1885]] the club turned professional,<ref name="Club records">{{cite web

[[Image:West Bromwich Albion team 1888.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Albion team of 1888, FA Cup winners and Football League founder members]]
In March 1888, [[William McGregor]] wrote to what he considered to be the top five English teams, including Albion, informing them of his intention to form an association of clubs that would play each other home and away each season.

Albion won the Football League title in [[1919-20 in English football|1919&ndash;20]] for the only time in their history following the end of the [[Second World War]], their totals of 104 goals and 60 points both breaking the previous league records.<ref>McOwan p42.</ref> The team finished as Division One runners-up in [[1924-25 in English football|1924&ndash;25]], narrowly losing out to [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], but were relegated in [[1926-27 in English football|1926&ndash;27]].<ref>McOwan p45.</ref> In [[1930-31 in English football|1930&ndash;31]] they won promotion as well as the [[1931 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]], beating [[Birmingham F.C.|Birmingham]]<!--They weren't Birmingham City until 1943--> 2&ndash;1 in the final.<ref>McOwan pp50&ndash;51.</ref> The "''Double''" of winning the FA Cup and promotion has not been achieved before or since.<ref>As of 2007.

In [[1953-54 in English football|1953&ndash;54]] Albion came close to being the first team in the 20th century to win the [[The Double|League and Cup double]]. They succeeded in winning the [[1954 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]], beating Preston 3&ndash;2, but a loss of form towards the end of the season meant that they finished as runners-up to fierce rivals [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] in the league.<ref>McOwan pp67&ndash;68.</ref> Nonetheless, Albion became known for their brand of fluent, attacking football, with the 1953&ndash;54 side being hailed as "The Team of the Century".

[[Image:1954 FA Cup memorabilia.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Memorabilia from the [[1954 FA Cup Final]]]]
Although their league form was less impressive during the 1960s, the second half of the decade saw West Bromwich Albion establish a reputation as a successful cup side. In [[1966 Football League Cup Final|1966]], under manager [[Jimmy Hagan]], they beat [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]] in their first League Cup appearance, winning 5&ndash;3 on aggregate in the last [[two-legged]] final. The following year they reached the [[1967 Football League Cup Final|final]] again, the first at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], but lost 3&ndash;2 to Third Division [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] after being 2&ndash;0 up at half-time.<ref>McOwan pp87&ndash;88.</ref> Albion's cup form continued under Hagan's successor [[Alan Ashman]]. He guided the club to their last major trophy to date, the [[1968 FA Cup Final|1968 FA Cup]], when they beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in [[extra time]] thanks to a single goal from [[Jeff Astle]].<ref>McOwan pp94&ndash;96.</ref> Albion reached the FA Cup semi-final and [[European Cup Winners Cup]] quarter-final in 1969, and were defeated 2&ndash;1 by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in the [[1970 Football League Cup Final|1970 League Cup Final]].<ref>McOwan pp97&ndash;99.</ref>

The club were less successful during the reign of [[Don Howe]], and were relegated to Division Two at the end of [[1972-73 in English football|1972&ndash;1973]],<ref>McOwan p105.</ref> but gained promotion three years later under the guidance of player-manager [[Johnny Giles]].<ref>McOwan pp113&ndash;114.</ref> Under [[Ron Atkinson]], Albion reached the 1978 FA Cup semi-final but lost to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].<ref>McOwan p120.</ref> In [[1978-79 in English football|1978&ndash;79]], the team finished third in Division One, their highest placing for over 20 years, and also reached the [[UEFA Cup 1978-79|UEFA Cup]] quarter-final, where they were defeated by [[Red Star Belgrade]].<ref>McOwan pp124&ndash;127.</ref> In his second spell as manager, [[Ronnie Allen]] guided the team to both domestic cup semi-finals in [[1981-82 in English football|1981&ndash;82]],<ref>McOwan pp136&ndash;138.</ref> the last time the club has reached that stage in a cup competition. The mid-1980s saw the start of Albion's longest and deepest decline. They were relegated in [[1985-86 in English football|1985&ndash;86]] with the worst record in the club's history,<ref>McOwan p144.</ref> beginning a period of sixteen years outside the top flight. Five years later the club were relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] for the first time.<ref>McOwan p154.</ref>

[[Image:WBA promotion 2003-04.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Albion celebrate promotion to the Premiership in 2004.]]
Albion had spent the majority of their history in the top-flight of English football, but when the [[FA Premier League]] was founded in 1992 the club found themselves in the third tier, which had been renamed [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]]. In [[1992-93 in English football|1992&ndash;93]] Albion finished fourth and entered the [[playoffs]] for the first time, having just missed out the previous year. Albion's first appearance at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] for over twenty years&mdash;and their last ever at the original stadium&mdash;saw them beat [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] 3&ndash;0 to return to the second level - now renamed the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>McOwan pp158&ndash;159.</ref> Manager [[Osvaldo Ardiles|Ossie Ardiles]] then joined [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] however, and a succession of managers over the next few seasons saw Albion consolidate their Division One status without ever mounting a serious promotion challenge.

The appointment of [[Gary Megson]] in March 2000 heralded an upturn in the club<U+2019>s fortunes. Megson guided Albion to Division One safety in [[1999-2000 in English football|1999&ndash;2000]], and to the playoffs a year later. He went on to lead the club to promotion to the Premiership in [[2001-02 in English football|2001&ndash;02]].<ref>{{cite news

West Bromwich Albion have played in navy blue and white striped shirts for the majority of their existence, usually with white shorts and white socks. The team is occasionally referred to as '''''The Stripes''''' by supporters. A number of different colours were trialled during the club's formative years however, including cardinal red and blue quarters in 1880&ndash;81, yellow and white quarters in 1881&ndash;82, chocolate and blue halves in 1881&ndash;82 and 1882&ndash;83, red and white hoops in 1882&ndash;83, chocolate and white in 1883&ndash;84 and cardinal red and blue halves in 1884&ndash;85.<ref>McOwan p13.</ref> The blue and white stripes made their first appearance in the [[1885-86 in English football|1885&ndash;86]] season, although at that time they were of a lighter shade of blue; the navy blue stripes did not appear until after the [[First World War]].<ref name="Historical Kits">{{cite web

Like all football clubs, Albion sport a secondary or "change" strip when playing away from home against a team whose colours clash with their own. A wide variety of different away colours have been worn over the years, but yellow and green striped shirts have been the most common choice since the early 1970s.<ref name="Kit Classics">{{cite web

[[Image:old west bromwich albion crest.png|thumb|left|125px|West Bromwich Albion's previous club crest, retired in 2006]]
[[Image:westbromcrest.jpg|thumb|right|125px|The town crest of [[West Bromwich]] has featured intermittently on Albion team shirts]]
Albion's main club crest dates back to the late 1880s, when then club secretary Tom Smith suggested that a [[throstle]] sitting on a crossbar be adopted for the crest.<ref name="McOwan p15 Throstle">McOwan p15. ''Throstle'' is a colloquial [[Black Country]] name for the [[song thrush]].</ref> Since then, the club crest has always featured a throstle, usually on a blue and white striped shield, although the crossbar was replaced with a [[Common Hawthorn|hawthorn]] branch at some point after the club's move to [[The Hawthorns]]. The throstle was chosen because the [[public house]] in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage. It also gave rise to Albion's early nickname, '''''The Throstles'''''. As late as the 1930s, a caged throstle was placed beside the touchline during matches and it was said that it only used to sing if Albion were winning.<ref name="McOwan p15 Throstle"/> In 1979 an effigy of a throstle was erected above the half-time scoreboard of the Woodman corner at The Hawthorns,<ref>Matthews (1987) p239.</ref> and was returned to the same area of the ground following redevelopment in the early 2000s.<ref>{{Cite web

|accessdate=2007-12-01}}</ref>

The crest has been subject to various revisions through the years, meaning that the club were unable to register it as a [[trademark]]. As a result of this, the crest was re-designed in 2006, incorporating the name of the club for the first time. The new crest gave Albion the legal protection they sought.<ref name="NewBadge">{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref>

The main club crest should be distinguished from the badge displayed on the first team strip, as the two have rarely coincided. No badge appeared on the kit for most of the club's history, although the [[Stafford#The Stafford knot|Stafford knot]] featured on the team jerseys for part of the 1880s.<ref name="Complete Record p64">Matthews (2007) p64.</ref> The [[West Bromwich]] town crest was worn on the players' shirts for the [[FA Cup Final 1931|1931]], [[FA Cup Final 1935|1935]] and [[FA Cup Final 1954|1954]] FA Cup finals. The crest's [[Latin]] motto, "[[Labor omnia vincit]]", translates as "labour conquers all things" or "work conquers all". The town crest was revived as the shirt badge from 1994 until 2000,<ref>The town crest remained on the away strip until 2001.</ref> with the throstle moved to the collar of the shirts.

Albion's first regular shirt crest appeared in the late 1960s and featured the familiar throstle, but without the blue and white striped shield of the club crest.<ref name="Historical Kits"/> This continued until the early 1970s, with a similar design used during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the mid 1970s, a more abstract version of the throstle was used on the club's shirts, while in the late 1970s through to the mid-1980s, an embroidered '''WBA''' logo was displayed, a common abbreviation of the club's name in print.<ref name="Historical Kits"/> Not until the early 21st century did the full club crest appear on the team's shirts.<ref name="Historical Kits"/>

West Bromwich Albion led something of a nomadic existence during their early years, playing at five different grounds in a 22-year period. Their first ground was Coopers Hill, which the club occupied from 1878 to 1879. From 1879 to 1881 they played additionally at Dartmouth Park, appearing to alternate between the two grounds during this time.<ref name="Full Throstle DVD">{{cite video

With a capacity of between 1,500 and 2,000,<ref name="Full Throstle DVD"/> it was their first enclosed ground, allowing the club to charge an entrance fee for the first time.<ref name="Complete Record p64"/> The increasing popularity of football led the well-established West Bromwich Dartmouth Cricket Club to rent their Four Acres ground to Albion from 1882 to 1885, but they quickly outgrew their new home and soon needed to move again. Albion's tenure of Stoney Lane, from 1885 to 1900, was arguably the most successful period in the club's history, as the club won the [[FA Cup]] twice and were runners-up three times. 

The expiry of the lease on Stoney Lane, as well as the club's desire for a more spacious location, saw them move once again in 1900, this time permanently. All of Albion's previous grounds had been close to the centre of West Bromwich, but on this occasion they took up an "out of town" site on the borders of [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]]. The area was covered in [[Common Hawthorn|hawthorn]] bushes, which were cleared to make way for the new ground, hence its name, [[The Hawthorns]].<ref name="Full Throstle DVD"/> Albion drew 1&ndash;1 with [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in the first match at the stadium, on September 3, 1900.<ref>Matthews (2007) p79.</ref> The Hawthorns experienced its record attendance on March 6, 1937, when 64,815 spectators saw Albion beat [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 3&ndash;1 in the FA Cup quarter-final.<ref>Matthews (2007) pp83&ndash;84.</ref> In the 1990s, following the [[Taylor Report]], the ground became all-seated.<ref name="Grounds for debate">{{Cite web

==="Baggies" nickname===
Although known in their early days as "The Throstles", the club's more popular nickname among supporters came to be '''''The Baggies''''', a term which the club itself looked down upon for many years but later embraced. The phrase was first heard at the Hawthorns in the [[1900s]], but its exact origins are uncertain.<ref name="McOwan pp38-40">McOwan pp38&ndash;40.</ref> One suggestion is that the name was bestowed on Albion supporters by their rivals at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], because of the large baggy trousers that many Albion fans wore at work to protect themselves from molten iron in the factories and foundries of the [[Black Country]].<ref name="Full Throstle DVD"/> Club historian Tony Matthews however suggests that it derives from the "bagmen", who carried the club's matchday takings in big leather bags from the turnstiles to the cash office on the halfway line.<ref name="BOING Baggies nickname">{{cite web

===Rivalries===
Despite the club's proximity to [[Birmingham]], most Albion fans see [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] as their main rivals. The two teams have contested the [[Black Country derby]] more than 150 times. Their first major clash was an [[FA Cup]] tie in [[1886]], although the rivalry really came to prominence when the two clubs contested the league title in 1953&ndash;54. During the 1990s the rivalry intensified to new heights among supporters, with both clubs languishing in Division One for much of the decade and only local pride at stake.<ref>McOwan p162.</ref> A 2004 survey by Planetfootball.com confirmed that the majority of both Albion and Wolves supporters consider the other to be their main rival, with Baggies fans naming [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], Albion's great rivals historically, and [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] as their second and third rivals respectively.<ref>{{cite web

==Ownership and governance==
[[Image:Billy Bassett chairman.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Billy Bassett]], Albion's chairman 1908&ndash;1937]]
In the club's formative years, West Bromwich Albion were run by a seven-man playing committee, and funded by each member contributing a weekly subscription of 6d ([[Sixpence (British coin)|six pence]]).<ref>Matthews (2007) p10.</ref> Albion's first chairman was [[Henry Jackson (football manager)|Henry Jackson]], appointed in 1885, with the club becoming a [[Limited company]] in June 1891.<ref name="Whos Who">Matthews 
(2005) pp267&ndash;269.</ref> Other early chairmen of Albion included 'Jem' Bayliss and [[Billy Bassett]], both of whom also played for the club. Indeed, from 1878 to 1986 there was always an Albion player or ex-player on the club's committee or board of directors.<ref name="Whos Who"/> Bassett became an Albion director in 1905, following the resignation of the previous board in its entirety. The club was in deep financial and had had a writ served upon them by their bank, but Bassett and returning chairman Harry Keys rescued the club, aided by local fund-raising activities.<ref>McOwan p33&ndash;34.</ref> Bassett became chairman in 1908, and helped the club to avoid bankruptcy once more in 1910 by paying the players' summer wages from his own pocket.<ref>McOwan p34&ndash;35.</ref>

Sir [[Bert Millichip]] served as Albion chairman from 1974 to 1983, after which he chose to concentrate on his role as chairman of [[The Football Association]].<ref>Matthews (1987) p309.</ref> In 1996 the club became a [[Public Limited Company]], issuing shares to supporters at <U+00A3>500 and <U+00A3>3000 each.<ref>{{cite web

As part of the club's 125th anniversary celebrations in 2004, a survey was commissioned via the official Albion website and the [[Express & Star]] newspaper to determine the greatest West Bromwich Albion players of all time. A modern-day 16-man squad was compiled from the results, and all selected players have been depicted on a special mural displayed at [[The Hawthorns]]. Fourteen of the sixteen players are English-born, with a fifteenth, Cyrille Regis, being a full [[England national football team|England]] international.
