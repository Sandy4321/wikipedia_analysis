'''Wayne Duncan''' is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'', played by Jonathon Sammy-Lee. He made his first screen appearance as Wayne during the episode broadcast on 4 February 1993. Wayne becomes a chemistry teacher at Erinsborough High with an unorthodox approach. He is arrogant, intelligent and articulate <U+2013> all traits that make him confident in arguments. A country man and strong believer in violence when protecting property <U+2013> Wayne's attitude and gun possession polarized the way other characters viewed him. He has a destructive romance with [[Gaby Willis]] ([[Rachel Blakely]]). The pair enjoy sparring throughout their relationship but eventually realise they need to separate.

Wayne also has relationships with [[Beth Brennan]] ([[Natalie Imbruglia]]) and [[Lauren Carpenter]] ([[Sarah Vandenbergh]]). One notable storyline for Wayne saw him brutally assaulted by a bike gang, which subsequently saw the leader being found dead and Wayne fighting a murder charge. Sammy-Lee was annoyed when the storyline came to an abrupt end. He decided to leave the role after one year, as he feared that staying longer would type cast him as a soap opera actor. His final appearance aired on 4 March 1994, seeing Wayne return to live on the farm. Critics have noted that Wayne was popular for his attractive appearance and smug persona.

==Casting==
Sammy-Lee secured the role of Wayne following two years of training to be an actor. He viewed the role as a "brilliant way" to learn more about the profession.<ref name=fire/>

===Departure===

Wayne's "matchmaking" brother, Troy (Damian Walshe-Howling) tricks the pair into dating. When Lauren gets drunk at a dinner party, Wayne offers to walk her home and she pulls him over her doorstep and kisses him as their friends stare. Sammy-Lee revealed "Then, when she invites him in for coffee, she spills milk on her blouse and takes it off. Wayne does the gentlemanly thing by covering her up with his jacket and putting her to bed. But Lauren reads more into it."<ref name=depart/> The following morning, Lauren assumes she has had sex with Wayne and forgot what actually happened. The truth is eventually revealed to Lauren and the misunderstanding gave their romance "a shaky start". Fletcher commented that friendship turned to lust for both characters during the storyline.<ref name=depart/> The storyline completed a recurring theme of relationship storyline Sammy-Lee played out. He told Fletcher that "Wayne can't control his hormones. In just a year in Eringborough there isn't a girl he hasn't tried to date. As long as they're pretty, he'll fall for them." Sammy-Lee concluded that after Wayne's long line of women, his fellow cast mates created a running joke that he was only left his relative Helen left to seduce.<ref name=depart>{{cite journal|last=Fletcher|first=Mary|title=It's not love with Wayne, it's lust!|journal=[[Woman's Own]]|issue=41|pages=10<U+2013>11|publisher=[[IPC Media]]}}</ref> His final scenes showed Wayne deciding to move back to live on his farm.<ref>[[#refjohnston|Johnston 2005]], p.204.</ref>

==Storylines==
Wayne gets a job as a teacher at Erinsborough High and arrives at 26 Ramsay Street looking for his mother's cousin, Helen. Helen's son-in-law, [[Jim Robinson (Neighbours)|Jim Robinson]] ([[Alan Dale]]) mistakes Wayne for a potential house buyer but Wayne explains who he is. Jim agrees Wayne can stay as he has plenty of room. While in the local pub, The Waterhole one night, Wayne tries to get the attention of Gaby and she accuses him of trying to grope her and pours beer all over him. Despite the animosity, there is a genuine attraction between the two and Gaby's grandfather [[Bert Willis|Bert]] ([[Bud Tingwell]]) gets them together. However, Gaby's mother, Pam takes a dislike to Wayne one evening when he joins the family for dinner after arguing over politics. Wayne's admission of keeping a gun in the garage does him no favours, despite his reasoning that he grew up in the country with the sense of protecting his property.

When Wayne gives Annalise detention, she responds by spreading rumours around the school that they are having an affair. Principal Peter Knotts (Simon Hughes) is forced to suspend Wayne after it is revealed that he left his previous school due to rumours of a similar incident. Wayne is vilified as a result and members of his own family, including Helen's granddaughter, [[Julie Martin (Neighbours)|Julie Martin]] (Julie Mullins), begin shunning him. Annalise eventually owns up to her lies and Wayne forgives her and they become friends after she finishes her schooling.

After being brutally beaten by a gang of heavies in a case of mistaken identity, Wayne goes back home to recuperate at his mother's farm. When he returns, He shocked to learn Cactus, a biker and one of the heavies who beat him, has been shot dead. Wayne tells the police he was with Lou at the time of the murder but the alibi is ruined when Lou's assistant tells them Lou was a the Car Yard all day. Wayne tries to prove his innocence and for a while it looks like he may face imprisonment. Luckily, a fellow biker comes forward and the charges against Wayne are dropped. This puts an end to Wayne and Gaby's relationship after the lack of support she has shown.

Wayne later becomes involved with Beth, who had recently been engaged to Brad which ended when she found out about Brad's affair with Lauren. Brad later tries to win Beth back and Wayne is prepared to fight for her. Both men propose to Beth, but she ultimately chooses Brad, leaving Wayne crushed. Following his failed engagement with Beth, Wayne has a brief romance with Lauren, who is also feeling hurt after Brad and Beth reunite and marry.

Vince Roland (Bob Brown), Knotts' successor at Erinsborough High, pushes Wayne's buttons by forcing him to teach an extra subject with no pay increase. Wayne feels his frustration building as Roland suspended him over the murder enquiry. The final straw comes when Roland admonishes him in front of his class for being late due to slashed tyres. Wayne can stand no more and punches Roland in the face. After this event, Wayne is disillusioned with being a teacher and general life in Erinsborough. Before he leaves, Wayne introduces fast bowler [[Mike Whitney]] as Erinsborough High's new cricket coach. On the day of Wayne's departure, he tries to slip away without a fuss but Helen arranges a surprise leaving party where the students of Erinsborough High present him with an "Outstanding contribution in the classroom" trophy and thank him for being such a great teacher.

==Reception==
To celebrate the 20th anniversary of ''Neighbours'', the [[BBC]] asked readers to nominate their twenty favourite obscure characters. Wayne came in third place and the readers said "How's about Wayne Duncan? He lived at the Robinson house, went out with Gabby Willis for a while and could open "stubbies" using only the fold between his upper arm and forearm. What a guy".<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4363958.stm|title=Your 20 favourite obscure Neighbours characters|date=21 October 2005|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref> Matthew Clifton, writing for entertainment website Heckler Spray, included Wayne in his list of "The Best Ever Mid-90s ''Neighbours'' Characters".<ref name="HS">{{cite web|url=http://www.hecklerspray.com/the-best-ever-mid-90s-neighbours-characters/200932420.php|title=The Best Ever Mid-90s Neighbours Characters|last=Clifton|first=Matthew|date=15 April 2009|publisher=Heckler Spray|accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref> Clifton said "The aforementioned Wayne was a hunky teacher at Erinsborough High, who was notable for having a top lip that never moved when he spoke.
