'''Charles Edward Anderson "Chuck" Berry''' (born October 18, 1926) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter, and one of the pioneers of [[rock and roll]] music. With songs such as "[[Maybellene]]" (1955),  "[[Roll Over Beethoven]]" (1956), "[[Rock and Roll Music]]" (1957) and "[[Johnny B. Goode]]" (1958), Chuck Berry refined and developed [[rhythm and blues]] into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and utilizing [[guitar solo]]s and [[Guitar showmanship|showmanship]] that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music.<ref name=Campbell2008p168>M. Campbell, ed., ''Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes on'' (Cengage Learning, 3rd edn., 2008), pp. 168<U+2013>9.</ref>

Born into a middle class family in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at [[Sumner High School (St. Louis)|Sumner High School]]. While still a high school student he served a prison sentence for [[armed robbery]] between 1944 and 1947. On his release, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953, influenced by the guitar [[riff]]s and showmanship techniques of blues player [[T-Bone Walker]], he was performing in the evenings with the [[Johnnie Johnson (musician)|Johnnie Johnson Trio]].<ref name=Britannica>{{cite web |url=http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9078885#cite |title=Chuck Berry <U+2013>  Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=library.eb.co.uk |accessdate=2010-02-21 }}</ref> His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955, and met [[Muddy Waters]], who suggested he contact [[Leonard Chess]] of [[Chess Records]]. With Chess he recorded "Maybellene"<U+2014>Berry's adaptation of the country song "[[Ida Red]]"<U+2014>which sold over a million copies, reaching #1 on Billboard's Rhythm and Blues chart. By the end of the 1950s, Berry was an established star with several hit records and film appearances to his name as well as a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis-based nightclub, called Berry's Club Bandstand.

After his release in 1963, Berry had several more hits, including "[[No Particular Place To Go]]", "[[You Never Can Tell (song)|You Never Can Tell]]", and "Nadine", but these did not achieve the same success, or lasting impact, of his 1950s songs, and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgic live performer, playing his past hits with local backup bands of variable quality.<ref name=Britannica/>  His insistence on being paid cash led to a jail sentence in 1979<U+2014>four months and community service for tax evasion.

Berry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on its opening in 1986, with the comment that he "laid the groundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and roll stance."<ref>{{cite web| title = Chuck Berry| publisher = The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum| url =http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/chuck-berry}}</ref> Berry is included in several ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' "Greatest of All Time" lists, including being ranked fifth on their 2004 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.<ref name=immortals>{{cite web| title = The Immortals: The First Fifty| work = Rolling Stone Issue 946| publisher = Rolling Stone| url =http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939208/5_chuck_berry |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080621080922/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939208/5_chuck_berry |archivedate = 2008-06-21}}</ref> [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]] included three of Chuck Berry's songs: "[[Johnny B.

Berry's calculated showmanship, along with mixing country tunes with R&B tunes, and singing in the style of [[Nat "King" Cole]] to the music of [[Muddy Waters]], brought in a wider audience, particularly affluent white people.<ref name=Britannica/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chuckberry.com/about/bio.htm |title=The Official Site of Chuck Berry |publisher=www.chuckberry.com |accessdate=2010-06-06 }}</ref>

==Signing with Chess: "Maybellene" to "Come On" (1955<U+2013>62)==
In May 1955, Berry traveled to Chicago where he met Waters, who suggested he contact [[Leonard Chess]] of [[Chess Records]]. Berry thought his blues material would be of most interest to Chess, but to his surprise it was an old country and western recording by [[Bob Wills]], entitled "[[Ida Red]]" that got Chess's attention. Chess had seen the [[rhythm and blues]] market shrink and was looking to move beyond it, and he thought Berry might be the artist for that purpose. So on May 21, 1955 Berry recorded an adaptation of "Ida Red"<U+2014>"[[Maybellene]]"<U+2014>which featured Johnnie Johnson on piano, Jerome Green (from [[Bo Diddley]]'s band) on the maracas, Jasper Thomas on the drums and [[Willie Dixon]] on the bass. "Maybellene" sold over a million copies, reaching #1 on Billboard's Rhythm and Blues chart and #5 on the 10 September 1955 Billboard Best Sellers in Stores chart.<ref name="Chuck Berry"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.die-rock-and-roll-ag.de/html/chuck_1955-56.html |title=Chuck 1955<U+2013>56 |publisher=Die-rock-and-roll-ag.de |date= |accessdate=2011-10-07}}</ref>

At the end of June 1956, his song "[[Roll Over Beethoven]]" reached #29 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] Top 100'' chart, and Berry toured as one of the "Top Acts of '56". He and [[Carl Perkins]] became friends. Perkins said that "I knew when I first heard Chuck that he'd been affected by country music. I respected his writing; his records were very, very great." As they toured, Perkins discovered that Berry not only liked country music, but knew about as many songs as he did. [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] was one of his favorites. "Chuck knew every Blue Yodel and most of [[Bill Monroe]]'s songs as well," Perkins remembered. "He told me about how he was raised very poor, very tough. He had a hard life. He was a good guy. I really liked him."<ref>Go, Cat, Go! by Carl Perkins and David McGee 1996 pages 215,216 Hyperion Press ISBN 0-7868-6073-1</ref>

Goode]]".  He appeared in two early rock and roll movies. The first was ''Rock Rock Rock,'' released in 1956. He is shown singing "You Can't Catch Me." He had a speaking role as himself in the 1959 film ''Go, Johnny, Go!'' along with [[Alan Freed]], and was also shown performing his songs "Johnny B.

Berry returned to Chess from 1970 to 1973.  There were no hit singles from the 1970 album ''Back Home'', then in 1972 Chess released a live recording of "[[My Ding-a-Ling]]", a novelty song which Berry had recorded in a different version on his 1968 LP ''From St. Louie to Frisco'' as "My Tambourine".<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=jWO4gdorYBwC&pg=PA184&dq=%22My+Tambourine%22++%22my+ding+a+ling%22&hl=en&ei=oWfSTZT3B4qV8QO2muXlCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22My%20Tambourine%22%20%20%22my%20ding%20a%20ling%22&f=false |title=Brown Eyed Handsome Man |author=Bruce Pegg|page=184|publisher=Routledge, 2005 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> The track became Berry's only No. 1 single. A live recording of "Reelin' And Rockin'" was also issued as a follow-up single that same year and would prove to be Berry's final top-40 hit in both the US and the UK. Both singles were featured on the part-live/part-studio album ''[[The London Chuck Berry Sessions]]'' which was one of a series of London Sessions albums which included other Chess mainstay artists [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]]. Berry's second tenure with Chess ended with the 1975 album ''Chuck Berry'', after which he did not make a studio record until 1979's ''[[Rock It (Chuck Berry album)|Rock It]]'' for [[Atco Records]], his last studio album to date.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Berry,_Chuck/Discography/album/P3664/R30491/ |title=Rock It Album Review, Songs, Ratings |publisher=www.starpulse.com |accessdate=2010-06-02 }}</ref>

In the 1970s Berry toured on the basis of his earlier successes. He was on the road for many years, carrying only his [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] guitar, confident that he could hire a band that already knew his music no matter where he went. [[Allmusic]] has said that in this period his "live performances became increasingly erratic, [...] working with terrible backup bands and turning in sloppy, out-of-tune performances" which "tarnished his reputation with younger fans and oldtimers" alike.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web

Springsteen related in the video ''[[Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll]]'' that Berry did not even give the band a set list and just expected the musicians to follow his lead after each guitar intro.  Berry neither spoke to nor thanked the band after the show.  Nevertheless, Springsteen backed Berry again when he appeared at the concert for the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1995. At the request of [[Jimmy Carter]], Chuck Berry performed at the [[White House]] on June 1, 1979.<ref name="Rock and Roll Hall of Fame">{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/chuck-berry|title=Chuck Berry|last=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|publisher=rockhall.com|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref>

Berry's type of touring style, traveling the "oldies" circuit in the 1970s (where he was often paid in cash by local promoters) added ammunition to the [[Internal Revenue Service]]'s accusations that Berry was a chronic income tax evader. Facing criminal sanction for the third time, Berry pleaded guilty to tax evasion and was sentenced to four months in prison and 1,000 hours of community service<U+2014>doing benefit concerts<U+2014>in 1979.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wEIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA61 |title=Jet <U+2013> Google Books |publisher=books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2010-06-02 }}</ref>

[[Image:ChuckBerry1997.jpg|right|thumb|Berry performing live in 1997]]

Berry continued to play 70 to 100 one-nighters per year in the 1980s, still traveling solo and requiring a local band to back him at each stop. In 1986, [[Taylor Hackford]] made a documentary film, ''[[Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll]]'', of a celebration concert for Berry's sixtieth birthday, organised by [[Keith Richards]], in which Berry reveals his bitterness at the fame and financial success that Richards achieved on the back of Berry's songs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/rocknroll-fireworks-keith-richards-and-chuck-berry-together-on-stage-440364.html |title=Rock'n'roll fireworks: Keith Richards and Chuck Berry together on stage <U+2013> Features, Music <U+2013> The Independent |publisher=www.independent.co.uk |accessdate=2010-06-06 | location=London | first=Taylor | last=Hackford | date=2007-03-16}}</ref> [[Eric Clapton]], [[Etta James]], [[Julian Lennon]], [[Robert Cray]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]], among others, appeared with Berry on stage and film. During the concert, Berry played a [[Gibson ES-355]], the luxury version of the [[Gibson ES-335|ES-335]] that he favored on his 1970s tours. Richards played a black Fender [[Telecaster]]  Custom, Cray a Fender [[Stratocaster]] and Clapton a Gibson ES 350T, the same guitar Berry used on his early recordings.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/23/us/sweet-tunes-fast-beats-and-a-hard-edge.html?pagewanted=7 |title=Sweet Tunes, Fast Beats and a Hard Edge - Series - NYTimes.com |publisher=www.nytimes.com |accessdate=2010-02-18 | first=Bernard | last=Weinraub | date=2003-02-23}}</ref>

In the late 1980s, Berry bought a restaurant in [[Wentzville, Missouri|Wentzville]], Missouri, called The Southern Air,<ref name="History of Rock">{{cite web|url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/berrytwo.htm|title=Chuck Berry|publisher=history-of-rock.com|accessdate=3 June 2010}}</ref> and in 1990 he was sued by several women who claimed that he had installed a [[video camera]] in the ladies' bathroom.  Berry claimed that he had the camera installed to catch red-handed a worker who was suspected of stealing from the restaurant. Though his guilt was never proven in court, Berry opted for a class action settlement with 59 women. Berry's biographer, Bruce Pegg, estimated that it cost Berry over $1.2 million plus legal fees.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/23/us/sweet-tunes-fast-beats-and-a-hard-edge.html?pagewanted=6 |title=Sweet Tunes, Fast Beats and a Hard Edge - Series - NYTimes.com |publisher=www.nytimes.com |accessdate=2010-02-18 | first=Bernard | last=Weinraub | date=2003-02-23}}</ref> It was during this time that he began using Wayne T. Schoeneberg as his legal counsel. Reportedly, a police raid on his house did find videotapes of women using the restroom, and one of the women was a minor. Also found in the raid were 62&nbsp;grams of marijuana. Felony drug and child-abuse charges were filed. In order to avoid the child-abuse charges, Berry agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor possession of marijuana. He was given a six-month suspended jail sentence, two years' unsupervised probation, and ordered to donate $5,000 to a local hospital.<ref name=RSBIO>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/chuckberry/biography |title=Chuck Berry: Biography|publisher=www.rollingstone.com |accessdate=2010-03-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080714112146/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/chuckberry/biography |archivedate = 2008-07-14}}</ref>

In November 2000, Berry again faced legal charges when he was sued by his former pianist [[Johnnie Johnson (musician)|Johnnie Johnson]], who claimed that he co-wrote over 50 songs, including "No Particular Place to Go", "Sweet Little Sixteen" and "Roll Over Beethoven", that credit Berry alone.

A pioneer of rock music, Berry was a significant influence on the development of both the music and the attitude associated with the rock music lifestyle. With songs such as "[[Maybellene]]" (1955),  "[[Roll Over Beethoven]]" (1956), "[[Rock and Roll Music]]" (1957) and "[[Johnny B. Goode]]" (1958), Chuck Berry refined and developed [[rhythm and blues]] into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics successfully aimed to appeal to the early teenage market by using graphic and humorous descriptions of teen dances, fast cars, high-school life, and consumer culture,<ref name=Britannica/> and utilizing [[guitar solo]]s and [[Guitar showmanship|showmanship]] that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music.<ref name=Campbell2008p168/> His records are a rich storehouse of the essential lyrical, showmanship and musical components of rock and roll; and, in addition to [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]], a large number of significant popular-music performers have recorded Berry's songs.<ref name=Britannica/> Though not technically accomplished, his guitar style is distinctive <U+2013> he incorporated electronic effects to mimic the sound of bottleneck blues guitarists, and drew on the influence of guitar players such as [[Charlie Christian]], and [[T-Bone Walker]],<ref name=Britannica>{{cite web |url=http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9078885?query=Chuck%20Berry&ct= |title=Chuck Berry <U+2013>  Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=library.eb.co.uk |accessdate=2010-06-04 }}</ref> to produce a clear and exciting sound that many later guitar musicians would acknowledge as a major influence in their own style.<ref name=RSBIO/>  In the film ''Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll!'' [[Eric Clapton]] states 'If you wanna play rock and roll - or any upbeat number - and you wanted to take a guitar ride you would end up playing like Chuck...because there is very little other choice.  There's not a lot of other ways to play rock and roll other than the way Chuck plays it; he's really laid the law down..."  In 1992 Keith Richards told ''Best of Guitar Player'' "Chuck was my man.  He was the one who made me say 'I want to play guitar, Jesus Christ!'...Suddenly I knew what I wanted to do."
