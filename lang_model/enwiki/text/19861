The '''Early Middle Ages in Romania''' started with the withdrawal of the [[Military of ancient Rome|Roman troops]] and [[Political institutions of ancient Rome|administration]] from [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]] province in the AD 270s. In the next millennium a series of peoples, most of whom only controlled two or three of the [[Historical regions of Romania|nearly ten historical regions]] that now form [[Romania]], arrived. During this period, society and culture underwent fundamental changes. Town life came to an end in Dacia with the Roman withdrawal, and in [[Scythia Minor]]{{spaced ndash}}the other [[Roman province]] in the territory of present-day Romania{{spaced ndash}}400 years later. Fine vessels made on fast potter's wheels disappeared and hand-made pottery became dominant from the 450s. Burial rites changed more than once from [[cremation]] to [[inhumation]] and ''vice versa'' until inhumation became dominant by the end of the 10th&nbsp;century.

The [[Eastern Germanic]] [[Goths]] and [[Gepids]], who lived in sedentary communities, were the first new arrivals. The Goths dominated [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] from the 290s, and parts of [[Transylvania]] from the 330s. Their power collapsed under attacks by the nomadic [[Huns]] in 376. The Huns controlled [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]] from around 400, but [[Hunnic Empire|their empire]] disintegrated in 454. Thereafter the regions west of the [[Carpathian Mountains]]{{spaced ndash}}[[Banat]], [[Cri<U+015F>ana]], and [[Transylvania]]{{spaced ndash}}and [[Oltenia]] were dominated by the [[Gepids]]. Within a century, the lands east of the mountains became important centers of the [[Antes people|Antes]] and [[Sclavenes]]. [[Hydronym]]s and [[place name]]s of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin also prove the one-time presence of [[Early Slavs]] in the regions west of the Carpathians.

The nomadic [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] subjugated the Gepids in 568 and dominated the [[Carpathian Basin]] up until around 800. The initially [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking [[Bulgars]] also established [[First Bulgarian Empire|a powerful empire]] in the 670s which included [[Dobruja]] and other the territories along the [[Lower Danube]]. Bulgaria officially adopted the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] variant of [[Christianity]] in 864. An armed conflict between Bulgaria and the nomadic [[Hungarians]] forced the latter to depart from the [[Pontic steppes]] and began the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|conquest of the Carpathian Basin]] around 895. Their invasion gave rise to the earliest reference, recorded some centuries later in the ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'', to a polity ruled by a [[Romanians|Romanian]] duke named [[Gelou]]. The same source also makes mention of the presence of the [[Sz<U+00E9>kelys]] in Cri<U+015F>ana around 895. The first contemporaneous references to Romanians{{spaced ndash}}who used to be known as [[Vlachs]]{{spaced ndash}}in the regions now forming Romania were recorded in the 12th and 13th centuries. References to Vlachs inhabiting the lands to the south of the Lower Danube abound in the same period.

Banat, Cri<U+015F>ana and Transylvania were integrated into the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 11th century. These regions were subject to plundering raids by the nomadic [[Pechenegs]] and [[Cumans]], who dominated the lowlands east of the mountains. [[Kings of Hungary|Hungarian monarchs]] promoted the immigration of [[Western Europe]]an colonists to Transylvania from the 1150s. The colonists' descendants, who were known as [[Transylvanian Saxons]] from the early 1200s, received collective privileges in 1224. Because of the settlement of the Saxons in their former territories, the Sz<U+00E9>kelys were moved to the easternmost zones of the kingdom. The emergence of the [[Mongol Empire]] in the [[Eurasian Steppes]] in the first decades of the 13th century had lasting effects on the history of the region. The [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]]  subjugated the Cumans in the 1230s and destroyed many settlements throughout the Kingdom of Hungary in 1241 and 1242, bringing the [[Early Middle Ages]] to an end.

[[File:Bgiusca Jirecek Line.jpg|190px|thumb|right|alt=Jire<U+010D>ek Line|The "[[Jire<U+010D>ek Line]]"]]
Romanians speak a language originating from the dialects of the Roman provinces north of the "[[Jire<U+010D>ek Line]]".{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=128}} This line divided, in Roman times, the predominantly Greek-speaking southern provinces from those where Latin was the principal language of communication.{{sfn|Hall|1974|p=70}} The emergence of [[Proto-Romanian language|Proto-Romanian]] from [[Vulgar Latin]] is first demonstrated by the words ''"torna, torna, frater"'' ("turn around, turn around, brother") recorded in connection with an [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] military action in 587 or 588. {{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=8}}{{sfn|V<U+00E9>kony|2000|pp=206-207}} The soldier shouting them "in his native tongue"<ref>''The Chronicle of Theophanes Confessor'' (258.10-21.), p. 381.</ref> spoke an [[Eastern Romance languages|Eastern Romance dialect]] of the [[Balkan Mountains]].{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=129}}

Grigore Nandris writes that the [[Romanian vocabulary]] suggests that the Romanians' ancestors were "reduced to a pastoral life in the mountains and to agricultural pursuits in the foothills of their pasture lands" following the collapse of the Roman rule.{{sfn|Nandris|1951|p=13}} A great number of Romanian words of uncertain origin{{sfn|Mallinson|2001|p=413}} are related to animal husbandry: ''baci'' ("chief shepherd"), ''baleg<U+0103>'' ("dung"), and ''[[br<U+00E2>nz<U+0103>]]'' ("cheese"), for instance, belong to this group.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=228}} Many words related to a more settled form of animal husbandry were borrowed from Slavic, including ''cote<U+0163>'' ("poultry house"), ''grajd'' ("stable"), and ''st<U+00E2>n<U+0103>'' ("fenced pasture").<ref name='Kopeck<U+00FD>'>{{Citation | last = Kopeck<U+00FD> | first = Peter | title = Caract<U+00E9>ristique lexicale de l'<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>ment slave dans le vocabulaire roumain: Confrontation historique aux s<U+00E9>diments lexicaux turcs et grecs [=Lexical characteristics of the Slavic elements of the Romanians language: A historical comparison with the Turkic and Greek lexical layers] | journal = Ianua: Revista Philologica Romanica | volume = 5 | issue = | year = 2004<U+2013>2005 | pages = 43<U+2013>53 | url = http://www.romaniaminor.net/ianua/Ianua05/ianua05_04.pdf}}</ref>{{sfn|Petrucci|1999|pp=142-143}} Romanian has preserved Latin terms for agriculture{{sfn|Nandris|1951|p=12}} and the Latin names of certain crops, but a significant part of its agricultural lexis originates from a Slavic-speaking population.<ref name="Kopeck<U+00FD>"/>{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=224}} The first group includes ''a ara'' ("to plough"), ''a secera'' ("to reap"), ''gr<U+00E2>u'' ("wheat"), ''in'' ("flax"), and ''furc<U+0103>'' ("pitchfork"), while ''a croi'' ("to cut out"), ''a plivi'' ("to weed"), ''brazd<U+0103>'' ("furrow"), ''cobil<U+0103>'' ("plow line"), ''coas<U+0103>'' ("scythe"), ''lopat<U+0103>'' ("shovel") and many others are Slavic loanwords.<ref name='Kopeck<U+00FD>'/>{{sfn|Petrucci|1999|pp=142-144}}

The Romanians' [[ethnogenesis]] cannot be understood based exclusively on written sources, because the earliest records on their ancestors were made by 11th-century [[Byzantine literature#Genres#Historians and annalists|Byzantine historians]].{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|pp=8, 13}} When referring to the Romance-speaking population of [[Southeastern Europe]], early medieval sources used the [[Vlachs|Vlach]] [[exonym]] or its [[cognate]]s, which all derrived from the [[Common Slavic]] term for speakers of the Latin language.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=14}}{{sfn|V<U+00E9>kony|2000|p=209}} The [[Origin of the Romanians#Written sources#Sources on the Balkan Vlachs|earliest sources]] write of the Vlachs of the central territories of the [[Balkan Peninsula]].{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=14}}{{sfn|V<U+00E9>kony|2000|p=209}}

[[Image:Dioecesis Thraciae 400 AD.png|190px|thumb|right|alt=Map of the Diocese of Thrace|[[Scythia Minor]] within the [[Diocese of Thrace]]]]
The territory between the Lower Danube and the Black Sea remained a fully integrated part of the Roman Empire, even after the abandonment of Trajan's Dacia.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|pp=110-111}} It was transformed into a separate province under the name of [[Scythia Minor]]{{sfn|MacKendrick|1975|pp=55-56, 221}} around 293.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|pp=17-18}} Before 300, the Romans erected small forts at [[Dierna (castra)|Dierna]] and in other places on the northern bank of the Danube in modern-day Banat.{{sfn|B<U+0103>rbulescu|2005|p=185}}{{sfn|Curta|2005|p=178}} In their wider region, Roman coins from the period{{mdash}}mostly of bronze{{mdash}}have been found.{{sfn|Ellis|1998|pp=231-232}}

The existence of Christian communities in Scythia Minor became evident under Emperor [[Diocletian]] (284&ndash;305).{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=115}} He and [[Tetrarchs|his co-emperors]] ordered the persecution of Christians throughout the empire, causing the death of many between 303 and 313.{{sfn|Opreanu|2005|p=115}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=33}} Under Emperor [[Constantine the Great]] (306&ndash;337), a [[Constantine's Bridge (Danube)|bridge across the Danube]] was constructed at [[Sucidava]], a new fort ([[Constantiana Daphne]]) was built, and ancient roads were repaired in Oltenia.{{sfn|MacKendrick|1975|pp=165, 221}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=61}} The Lower Danube again became the empire's northern boundary in 369 at the latest, when Emperor [[Valens]] met [[Athanaric]]{{mdash}}the head of the Goths{{mdash}}in a boat in the middle of the river because the latter had taken an oath "never to set foot on Roman soil".{{sfn|Heather|2010|pp=72, 75}}<ref>''Ammianus Marcellinus: The Later Roman Empire'' (27.5.), p. 337.</ref>

The Huns destroyed Drobeta and Sucidava in the 440s, but the forts were restored under Emperor [[Justinian I]] (527&ndash;565).{{sfn|MacKendrick|1975|pp=165-166, 222}} [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] coins from the first half of the 6th&nbsp;century suggest a significant military presence in Oltenia{{mdash}}a region also characterized by the predominance of pottery with shapes of Roman tradition.{{sfn|Teodor|2005|pp=216, 223-224}} Although [[Eastern Roman emperors]] made annual payments to the neighboring peoples in an attempt to keep the peace in the Balkans, the Avars regularly invaded Scythia Minor from the 580s.{{sfn|Curta|2006|pp=54-55, 64-65}} The Romans abandoned Sucidava in 596 or 597,{{sfn|MacKendrick|1975|p=166, 222}} but [[Constan<U+021B>a|Tomis]], which was the last town in Scythia Minor to resist the invaders, only fell in 704.{{sfn|MacKendrick|1975|pp=178, 222}}

===North of the ''limes'' (''c.''&nbsp;270&ndash;''c.''&nbsp;330)===
Transylvania and northern Banat, which had belonged to Dacia province, had no direct contact with the Roman Empire from the 270s.{{sfn|B<U+0103>rbulescu|2005|p=181}} There is no evidence that they were invaded in the following decades.{{sfn|Haynes|Hanson|2004|p=24}} Towns, including [[Apulum (castra)|Apulum]] and [[Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa]], and the surrounding areas{{sfn|Haynes|Hanson|2004|p=24}} continued to be inhabited but the urban areas diminished.{{sfn|B<U+0103>rbulescu|2005|p=183}} The existence of local Christian communities can be assumed in [[Porolissum]], [[Potaissa]] and other settlements.{{sfn|B<U+0103>rbulescu|2005|pp=186-187}} On the other hand, evidence{{spaced ndash}}mainly pottery with "[[Chi (letter)|Chi]]-[[Rho|rho]]" ''(<U+03A7>-<U+03A1>)''  signs and other Christian symbols{{spaced ndash}}is "shadowy and poorly understood", according to archaeologists Haynes and Hanson.{{sfn|Haynes|Hanson|2004|pp=22-24}}

Urns found in late 3rd-century cemeteries at [[Bezid]], [[Media<U+015F>]], and in other Transylvanian settlements had clear analogies in sites east of the Carpathians, suggesting that the [[Carpians]] were the first new arrivals in the former province from the neighboring regions.{{sfn|B<U+0103>rbulescu|2005|p=185}}{{sfn|B<U+00F3>na|1994|p=65}} Other Carpian groups, pressured by the Goths, also departed from their homeland and sought refuge in the Roman Empire around 300.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=56-57}} Nevertheless, "[[Carpo-Dacians]]" were listed among the peoples "mixed with the Huns"<ref>{{Citation|last = Zosimus|first = |author-link = |title = The History |year = 2002 |url = http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/zosimus04_book4.htm | accessdate = 18 July 2012}}</ref> as late as 379.{{sfn|Heather|2010|pp=166, 660}}{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=30}} The [[Sarmatians]] of the Banat{{sfn|B<U+0103>rbulescu|2005|p=185}} were allies of the empire, demonstrated by a Roman invasion in 332 against the Goths, their enemies.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=168}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=61}} Sarmatians were admitted into the empire in 379, but other Sarmatian groups remained in the Tisa plains up until the 460s.{{sfn|Heather|2006|p=330}}{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=151}}

The Huns, a people of uncertain origin,{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=123}} were nomadic and wandered "with the wagons"<ref>''Ammianus Marcellinus: The Later Roman Empire'' (31.2.), p. 412.</ref> in the 370s.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|pp=47, 50}} They were eminent mounted archers who imposed their authority over an increasing number of neighboring peoples.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|pp=30, 40-41}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=123-124}} Their first ruler whose seat was located in the Lower Danube region was [[Uldin]], initially an important ally and later an enemy of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] between 401 and 408.{{sfn|Heather|2006|p=196}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=126}}

The Eastern Roman government paid an annual tribute to the Huns from the 420s.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=127-128}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|pp=93-94}} Gold flowing from the empire transformed the Hun society.{{sfn|Heather|2006|p=329}} The introduction of a centralized monarchy is evidenced in a report written by [[Priscus of Panium]], an Eastern Roman envoy sent to the ruler of the Huns, [[Attila the Hun|Attila]], in 448.{{sfn|Heather|2006|pp=325-329, 485}} At that time, Gothic was widely spoken in the royal court since "the subjects of the Huns" spoke "besides their own barbarous tongues, either [[Hunnic language|Hunnic]] or Gothic, or{{mdash}}as many as have commercial dealings with the [[Western Roman Empire|western Romans]]{{mdash}}Latin".{{sfn|Heather|2006|p=329}}<ref name='Priscus'>{{Citation|last = Bury|first = J.

The last "S<U+00E2>ntana de Mure<U+015F>-Chernyakhov" objects once widespread in ''Gutthiuda''{{spaced ndash}}such as fine wares and weapons{{spaced ndash}}are dated to the period ending around 430.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=200}} According to Coriolan H.

There are few known cemeteries from the second half of the 5th&nbsp;century,{{sfn|Teodor|1980|p=11}} pointing to common use of cremation without the use of urns or pits.{{sfn|Barford|2001|pp=201, 402}} On the other hand, a huge biritual necropolis at [[S<U+0103>rata-Monteoru]] produced more than 1,600 cremation burials, either in wheel-made urns or in pits without urns.{{sfn|Teodor|2005|pp=234-235}}{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=202}} Small cemeteries with inhumation graves have been found at [[Nichiteni]] and [[Secuieni, Neam<U+0163>|Secuieni]].{{sfn|Teodor|1980|p=11}}
[[File:Slavic peoples 6th century historical map.jpg |190px |thumb |right |alt=Map of the expansion of the Early Slavs |Expansion of the [[Antes people|Antes]] and [[Sclavenes]] in the 6th century]]
Jordanes, [[Procopius]] and other 6th-century authors used the terms "[[Sclavenes]]" and "[[Antes people|Antes]]" to refer to the peoples inhabiting the territory north of the Lower Danube.{{sfn|Curta|2008|p=201}} The Antes launched their first campaign over the Lower Danube in 518.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=81, 115}} After they concluded a treaty with the Eastern Roman Empire in 545, the Sclavenes started to plunder the Balkan provinces.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=81}} Both ethnic groups seized many prisoners of wars during their raids, but they were ready to integrate them "as free men and friends".{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=58}}<ref>''Maurice's Strategikon'' (11.4.4-5), p. 120.</ref>  

The names of early 6th-century leaders of the Sclavenes or Antes are unknown.{{sfn|Curta|2005|p=184}} This  supports ancient authors' claims that both ethnic groups lived "under a democracy".{{sfn|Curta|2005|p=332}}<ref>''Procopius: History of the Wars'' (7.14.22.), p. 269.</ref> The same conclusion can be drawn from [[Procopius of Caesarea|Procopius]]'s report of the "phoney Chilbudius"{{spaced ndash}}a young Antian serf who "spoke the Latin tongue"<ref>''Procopius: History of the Wars'' (7.14.33.), p. 275.</ref>{{spaced ndash}}who was dispatched by his fellow tribesmen to negotiate with the Eastern Roman Empire in 545.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=79-80, 331-332}} 

The disappearance of bronze and gold coins from sites north of the Lower Danube demonstrates an "economic closure of the frontier" of the Eastern Roman Empire between 545 and 565.{{sfn|Curta|2005|pp=186, 196}}{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=52}} The same period is characterized by a tendency towards cultural unification in Moldavia, Oltenia and Wallachia.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=309}} Handmade pots with very similar incised designs evidence the "existence of a cross-regional set of symbols shared" by either potters or consumers.{{sfn|Curta|2008|pp=185, 309}} Pots, [[spindle whorl]]s and other objects decorated with crosses or swastikas have been unearthed at C<U+00E2>nde<U+015F>ti, [[Lozna, Boto<U+015F>ani|Lozna]], and other sites.{{sfn|Teodor|2005|pp=221-222}}{{sfn|Curta|2008|p=185}} The use of handmade clay pans for baking bread was spreading from the regions south and east of the Carpathians towards lands over the Dniester and the Lower Danube.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=295-297, 309}}

The [[Turkic languages|Turkic-speaking]]{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=56}} [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] occupied ''Gepidia'' in 567, less than a decade after their arrival in Europe.{{sfn|Heather|2010|pp=213, 401}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|pp=220-221}} They were nomadic pastoralists,{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=2-3}} who settled in the lowlands.{{sfn|Urba<U+0144>czyk|2005|p=144}} Stirrups found at [[Secusigiu|S<U+00E2>npetru German]] are among the earliest finds in Romania attributed to the Avars.{{sfn|B<U+00F3>na|1994|p=93}} They received agricultural products from farming communities settled in their domains and neighboring peoples subjected to their authority.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=65}} Emperor [[Justin II]] hired, in 578, the Avars to attack the Sclavenes{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=57}} who resumed their plundering raids against the empire around that time.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=115}} The names of some of the Sclavene leaders were first recorded in the following period.{{sfn|Barford|2001|pp=60-61}} One of them, [[Musocius]], "was called ''rex'' in the barbarian tongue".{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=101}}<ref>''The History of Theophylact Simocatta'' (vi. 9.1.), p. 172.</ref>

Graves of males interred together with horses found at [[Aiud]] and [[Mez<U+0151>b<U+00E1>nd|Band]] prove the Avars' settlement in Transylvania in the early 7th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|B<U+00F3>na|1994|p=93}} Their cemeteries are centered around salt mines.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005a|pp=103, 117}} Spurs{{mdash}}never found in Avar context but widely used in [[Western Slavs|Western Slav]] territories{{sfn|Barford|2001|pp=79, 84}}{{mdash}} were unearthed in [[<U+015E>ura Mic<U+0103>]] and [[Medi<U+015F>oru Mare]], suggesting the employment of non-Avar horsemen in the 8th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005a|p=106}}

Large "[[Late Avar]]" cemeteries used by several generations between ''c.''&nbsp;700 and ''c.''&nbsp;800 imply "an advanced degree of sedentization" of the entire society.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=92}} The Avar Empire collapsed after the [[Franks]] launched  [[Charlemagne#Eastern campaigns#Avars campaigns|three campaigns]] against the westernmost Avar territories between 791 and 803.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=2-3}} Soon afterwards the [[Bulgars]] attacked the Avars from the southeast,{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=78}} and [[Charlemagne]] settled Avar groups in [[Pannonia]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=78}}

The arrival of the [[Cumans]] in the Lower Danube region was first recorded in 1055.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=246}} A 17th-century version of the Turkic chronicle ''[[Oghuzname]]''{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=257}} relates that Quipchaq, the ancient Cuman hero, fought against the ''Ulak'' (Romanians), along with other nations.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=117}} Cuman groups assisted the rebelling Bulgarians and Vlachs against the Byzantines between 1186 and 1197.{{sfn|V<U+00E1>s<U+00E1>ry|2005|pp=42-47}}

"Dridu" villages of the lowlands east of the Carpathians were abandoned between 1050 and 1080,{{sfn|Curta|2006|p = 306}} around which time new settlements appeared on higher land on both banks of the Prut.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p = 306}} A sharp decrease from 300 to 35 in the number of archaeological sites{{mdash}}settlements, cemeteries and coin hords{{mdash}}evidences a population decline which continued well into the 13th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|pp = 193-194}} Byzantine troops marching towards Transylvania through the territory east of the Carpathians encountered "a land entirely bereft of men"<ref>''Deeds of John and Manuel Comnenus by John Kinnamos'' (6.3.261), p. 196.</ref> in 1166.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p = 316}}

A coalition of [[List of early East Slavic states#Council of Liubech and after (1097-1237)|Rus' princes]] and Cuman tribes suffered a sound defeat by the Mongols in the [[Battle of the Kalka River]] in 1223.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=298}} Shortly thereafter Boricius, a Cuman chieftain,{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=406}} accepted baptism and the supremacy of the king of Hungary.{{sfn|Makkai|1994|p=193}} The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cumania]] was set up in his territories in 1228.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=406}} A letter of 1234{{sfn|Makkai|1994|p=193}} written by [[Pope Gregory IX]] refers to a "certain people within the Cuman bishopric called ''Walati''" (Vlachs) who even persuaded Catholic Hungarians and Germans to accept the ecclesiastic authority of Orthodox prelates.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=408}}

===Mongol invasion (1241&ndash;1242)===

The [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], who had decided to invade Europe in 1235,{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=409}} attacked the Cumans in 1238.{{sfn|V<U+00E1>s<U+00E1>ry|2005|p=64}} Masses of Cumans sought refuge in Bulgaria and Hungary.{{sfn|V<U+00E1>s<U+00E1>ry|2005|pp=64-65}} The Mongols crossed the Carpathians in March 1241,{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=410}} and soon afterwards they destroyed "the rich village of the Germans" ([[Rodna]]),<ref>''Master Roger's Epistle'' (ch. 20), p. 167.</ref> and took [[Bistri<U+021B>a]], Cluj,{{sfn|Makkai|1994|p=195}} and Oradea.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=410}} Another Mongol army "proceeded by way of the ''Qara-Ulagh''" ("Black Vlachs"),<ref name="Rashid">''The Successors of Genghis Khan'' (ch. 1.), p. 70.</ref> and defeated their leader named "[[Bezerenbam and Mi<U+015F>elav|Mishlav]]".{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=410}}<ref name="Rashid"/> They also entered Transylvania, sacked Alba Iulia, Sibiu, the abbeys at C<U+00E2>r<U+0163>a and [[Igri<U+0219> Abbey|Igri<U+0219>]], and Cenad.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=410}}

The Mongol invasion lasted for a year, and the Mongols devastated huge swathes of territory of the kingdom before their unexpected withdrawal in 1242.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|pp=436-442}} [[Matthew Paris]] and other contemporaneous scholars considered the Mongol invasion as a "sign of apocalypse".{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=447}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|pp=413-414}} Whole villages were destroyed, and many were never rebuilt.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=414}} According to a royal charter of 1246, Alba Iulia, [[Harina]], [[Gil<U+0103>u, Cluj|Gil<U+0103>u]], [[M<U+0103>ri<U+015F>elu]],<ref name='Tekinto_A_H'>{{Citation|last = Vistai | first = Andr<U+00E1>s J<U+00E1>nos |title = Tekint<U+0151>: Erd<U+00E9>lyi helyn<U+00E9>vk<U+00F6>nyv, Els<U+0151> k<U+00F6>tet, A&ndash;H (""Tekint<U+0151>": Book on Transylvanian Toponymy, Volume II, A&ndash;H ") | url = http://www.fatornyosfalunk.com/helynevkonyv_-_1._kotet_A-H.pdf | accessdate = 27 July 2012}}</ref> [[T<U+0103><U+0219>nad]] and [[Zal<U+0103>u]] were almost depopulated.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2003|pp=156-157}} Another charter from 1252 evidences that ''Zec''<ref>{{Citation|last = Vistai | first = Andr<U+00E1>s J<U+00E1>nos |title = Tekint<U+0151>: Erd<U+00E9>lyi helyn<U+00E9>vk<U+00F6>nyv, Harmadik k<U+00F6>tet, Q&ndash;Zs (""Tekint<U+0151>": Book on Transylvanian Toponymy, Volume II, Q&ndash;Zs") | url = http://www.fatornyosfalunk.com/helynevkonyv_-_3._kotet_Q-Zs.pdf | accessdate = 27 July 2012}}</ref> a village on the Olt was totally deserted.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2003|p=157}}

{{Quote|''After the devastation of the region, they'' [the Mongols] ''surrounded the great village with a combined force of some [[Tatars]] together with [[Russians]], Cumans and their Hungarian prisoners. They sent first the Hungarian prisoners ahead and when they were all slain, the Russians, the [[B<U+00F6>sz<U+00F6>rm<U+00E9>ny|Ishmaelites]], and Cumans went into battle. The Tatars, standing behind them all at the back, laughed at their plight and ruin and killed those who retreated from the battle and subjected as many as they could to their devouring swords, so that after fighting for a week, day and night, and filling up the moat, they captured the village. Then they made the soldiers and ladies, of whom there were many, stand in a field on one side and the peasants on the other. Having robbed them of their money, clothing and other goods, they cruelly executed them with axes and swords, leaving only some of the ladies and girls alive, whom they took for their entertainment.''|''[[Roger of Torre Maggiore|Master Roger]]'s Epistle''<ref>''Master Roger's Epistle'' (ch. 37), p. 213.</ref>}}

A new period of intensive colonization began in Banat, Transylvania and other regions within the Kingdom of Hungary after the withdrawal of the Mongols.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2003|p=2003}} King B<U+00E9>la IV was also considering settling the [[Knights Hospitallers]] in the lands between the Carpathians and the Lower Danube.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=408}} His diploma of 1247 for the Knights evidences the existence of four Romanian polities in the region.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=163}} They were under the rule of ''voivodes'' [[Litovoi]] and [[Seneslau]], and of ''knezes'' [[Farca<U+015F>]] and [[John (knez)|John]].{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=163}}

Internal conflicts characterized the last decades of the 13th century in the Kingdom of Hungary.{{sfn|S<U+0103>l<U+0103>gean|2001|pp=179-183}} For instance, a feud between King B<U+00E9>la and his son, [[Stephen V of Hungary|Stephen]] caused a civil war which lasted from 1261 to 1266.{{sfn|S<U+0103>l<U+0103>gean|2001|pp=177-178}} Taking advantage of the emerging anarchy, Voivode Litovoi attempted to get rid of the Hungarian monarchs' suzerainty in the 1270s, but he fell in a battle while fighting against royal troops.{{sfn|S<U+0103>l<U+0103>gean|2001|p=192}}{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=17}} One of his successors, [[Basarab I of Wallachia]] was the first Romanian monarch whose sovereignty was internationally recognized after his victory over King [[Charles I of Hungary]] in the [[Battle of Posada]] of 1330.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=17}}
