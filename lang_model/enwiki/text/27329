==Origins of the name==
The word "Gharabagh" is generally believed to originate from [[Turkic language|Turkic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], literally meaning "black garden".<ref name= "bbc2005">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/3658938.stm Regions and territories: Nagorno-Karabakh]. ''[[BBC News]]''. Accessed August 29, 2009.</ref> An alternative theory, proposed by [[Bagrat Ulubabyan]], is that it has a Turkic-Armenian origin, meaning "Greater Baghk", a reference to Ktish-Baghk (later: [[Dizak]]), one of the principalities of Artsakh during the eleventh to thirteenth centuries.<ref>Hewsen, Robert H.

==History==
{{Main|History of Nagorno-Gharabagh}}

===Ancient and medieval===
Lowland and Highland Karabakh, which was populated with various Caucasian tribes, were believed to have been conquered by Armenians in the second century B.C. and organized as the [[Artsakh]] province of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. However, it is possible that the region had earlier been part of [[Orontid Armenia]] from the fourth to second centuries B.C.<ref>Hewsen. ''Armenia'', pp. 118-121.</ref> After the partition of Armenia by Rome and Persia in 387 A.D., it became a part of [[Caucasian Albania]]. The Arab invasions later led to the rise of several Armenian princes who came to establish their dominance in the region.<ref name="Atlas">Hewsen. ''Armenia'', pp. 119, 155, 163, 264-265.</ref> Centuries of constant warfare on the Armenian Plateau forced many Armenians, including those in the Karabakh region, to emigrate and settle elsewhere. During the period of Mongol domination, a great number of Armenians left Lowland Karabakh and sought refuge in the mountainous (Highland) heights of the region.<ref>[[George Bournoutian|Bournoutian, George A]]. "Review of ''The Azerbaijani Turks: Power and Identity Under Russian Rule'', by Audrey L. Altstadt," ''[[Armenian Review]]'' 45 (Autumn 1992): pp. 63-69.</ref>

In the fifteenth century, the [[Germans|German]] traveler [[Johann Schiltberger]] toured Lowland Karabakh and described it as a large and beautiful plain in Armenia, ruled by Muslims.<ref>[[Johannes Schiltberger]]. ''Bondage and Travels of Johann Schiltberger.'' Translated by J. Buchan Telfer. Ayer Publishing, 1966, p. 86. ISBN 0-8337-3489-X.</ref> Highland Karabakh from 821 until the early ninthteenth century passed under the hands of a number of states, including the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], [[Bagratid Armenia]], the Mongol [[Ilkhanate]] and [[Jalayirids|Jalayirid Sultanate]]s, the Turkic [[Kara Koyunlu]], [[Ak Koyunlu]] and Karabakh Baylarbaylik states of the [[Safavid Empire]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Caucasus and Globalization |last1= |first1= |authorlink= |year=2006 |volume= 1 |publisher= Institute of Strategic Studies of the Caucasus |location= Sweden|isbn= |page=9 |pages= |url= http://www.ca-c.org/c-g-online/2006/journal_eng/c-g-1/C-G-E-01-2006.pdf |accessdate= 2011-10-17}}</ref> Armenian princes times ruled as vassal territories by the Armenian House of [[Khachen]] and its several lines, the latter [[Melikdoms of Karabakh]].<ref name="Atlas"/> The Safavids appointed the rulers of [[Ganja khanate]] from Ziad-oglu Qajar family to govern Karabakh.<ref>"[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ganja- Ganja]."

In 1747, [[Panah Ali Khan|Panah Javanshir]], a local Turkic chieftain, seized control of the region after the death of the Persian ruler [[Nadir Shah]], and both Lower Karabakh and Highland Karabakh comprised the new [[Karabakh Khanate]].<ref name="Atlas"/>

===Modern===

In 1813, under the terms of the [[Treaty of Gulistan]], the region of Karabakh was lost by the Persians to the [[Russian Empire]]. Under Russian rule, Karabakh (both Lowland and Highland) was a region with an area of 13,600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (5,250 sq mi), with [[Shusha]] (Shushi) as its most prominent city. Its population consisted of [[Armenians]] and [[Muslims]] (mainly of "Tatars," but also [[Kurds]]). The Russians conducted a census in 1823 and had tallied the number of villages (though not the number of people) and assessed the tax basis of the entire Karabakh khanate, which also included Lowland Karabakh.<ref>For an English translation see, ''The 1823 Russian Survey of the Karabagh Province: A Primary Source on the Demography and Economy of Karabagh in the First Half of the 19th Century''. Trans. George A. Bournoutian. Costa Mesa, CA, 2011.</ref> It is probable that the Armenians formed the majority of the population of Eastern Armenia at the turn of the seventeenth century,<ref>Bournoutian, George A. "Eastern Armenia from the Seventeenth Century to the Russian Annexation," in ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume II: Foreign Dominion to Statehood: The Fifteenth Century to the Twentieth Century'', ed. [[Richard G. Hovannisian]]. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1997, p. 96.</ref> but following [[Shah Abbas I]]'s massive relocation of Armenians in 1604-05 their numbers decreased markedly, as they eventually became a minority among their Muslim neighbors.

According to the statistics of the initial survey carried out by the Russians in 1823 and an official one published in 1836, Highland Karabakh was found almost overwhelmingly Armenian in population.<ref name="GB">Bournoutian, George. "[http://www.umd.umich.edu/dept/armenian/sas/bour2.html The Politics of Demography: Misuse of Sources on the Armenian Population of Mountainous Karabakh]." ''Journal of the Society for Armenian Studies'' 9 (1996-1997): pp. 99-103.</ref> On the other hand, the population of the Karabakh khanate, taken as a whole, was largely made up of Muslims (91% Muslim versus 9% Armenian).<ref name="Cornell">Cornell, Svante.

Richmond, Surrey, England: Curzon, 2001, p. 54. ISBN 0-700-71162-7.</ref> A decade after the Russian annexation of the region, a large number of Armenians who had fled Karabakh during the reign of [[Ibrahim Khalil Khan]] (1730-1806) and settled in Yerevan, [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], and parts of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] were repatriated to their villages, many of which had been left derelict.<ref name="GB"/> An additional 279 Armenian families were settled in the villages of [[Ghapan]] and [[Meghri]] in [[Syunik]].<ref name="GB"/> Though some of the returning Armenians wished to settle in Karabakh, they were told by Russian authorities that there was no room for them.<ref name="GB"/> This took place at the same time as a large number of the Muslims of the region departed for the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Iran. The percentage of Armenians accordingly increased to 35% in 1832 and 53% in 1880. These were also seen as consequences of Russo-Turkish wars of 1855-1856 and 1877-1878 because Russians saw the Muslims as unreliable and allies to their ethnically close Turks.<ref>Cornell. ''Small Nations'', p. 54.</ref>

In 1828 the Karabakh khanate was dissolved and in 1840 it was absorbed into the Kaspijskaya (Caspian) oblast, and subsequently, in 1846, made a part of [[Shemakha Governorate]]. In 1876 it was made a part of the [[Elisabethpol Governorate]], an administrative arrangement which remained in place until the Russian Empire collapsed in 1917.

After the dissolution of Russian Empire Karabakh, Zangezur and Nakhchivan were disputed between newly established republics of Armenia and [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]].<ref>[[Richard G. Hovannisian|Hovannisian, Richard G]]. "The Armeno-Azerbaijani Conflict Over Mountainous Karabagh," ''[[Armenian Review]]'' 24 (Summer 1971).</ref> Fighting between two republics broke out. Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in [[World War I]], British troops occupied the [[South Caucasus]]. The British command affirmed Khosrov bey Sultanov (an appointee of the Azerbaijani government) as the provisional governor-general of Karabakh and Zangezur, pending a final decision by the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. But in 1920, Azerbaijan and Armenia were sovietized and  Karabakh's status was taken up by the Soviet authorities.<ref>See Hovannisian, Richard G.

In 1923, parts of Karabakh were made a part of the newly established [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO), an administrative entity of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]], leaving it with a population that was 94% Armenian.<ref>{{Cite book

===Nagorno-Karabakh War===

In February 1988, within the context of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s ''glasnost'' and ''perestroika'' policies, the Supreme Soviet of the NKAO voted to unite itself with the Armenia.<ref>[[Thomas de Waal|De Waal, Thomas]]. ''Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan Through Peace and War''. New York: New York University Press, 2003, pp. 10-11.</ref> By the summer of 1989 the Armenian-populated areas of the NKAO were under blockade by Azerbaijan as a response to Armenia's blockade against [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]], cutting road and rail links to the outside world. On July 12 the Nagorno-Karabakh AO Supreme Soviet voted to secede from Azerbaijan, which was rejected unanimously by the [[Supreme Soviet of USSR]], declaring NKAO had no right to secede from [[Azerbaijan SSR]] under Soviet Constitution.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/24806449.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jul+19%2C+1988&author=Vincent+J+Schodolski%2C+Chicago+Tribune&pub=Chicago+Tribune+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&edition=&startpage=4&desc=TOP+SOVIETS+REJECT+ARMENIA%27S+CLAIM+AZERBAIJAN+KEEPS+DISPUTED+REGION |title=TOP SOVIETS REJECT ARMENIA'S CLAIM AZERBAIJAN KEEPS DISPUTED REGION |publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' |date=1988-07-19 |accessdate=2011-10-17}}</ref> Soviet authorities in Moscow then placed the region under its direct rule, installing a special commission to govern the region. In November 1989 the Kremlin returned the oblast to Azerbaijani control. The local government in the region of [[Shahumian]] also declared its independence from the Azerbaijan SSR in 1991.<ref>De Waal. ''Black Garden'', p. 85.</ref>

In late 1991, the Armenian representatives in the local government of the NKAO proclaimed the region a republic, independent from Azerbaijan. Portions of the lowland Karabakh are now under the control of the Karabakh Armenian forces. The region's Azerbaijani inhabitants were forced to leave the territories remaining under Armenian control.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Karabakh dialect==
The Armenian population of the region speaks the Karabakh dialect of Armenian which has been heavily influenced by the Persian, Russian, and Turkish languages.<ref>De Waal. ''Black Garden'', p. 186.</ref> It was the most extensively spoken of all Armenian dialects until the Soviet period when the dialect of [[Yerevan]] became the official tongue of the [[Armenian SSR]].<ref name="Meliks1"/>

==Flora==
The tulip species ''[[Tulipa armena]]'' is [[native plant|native]] to Karabakh.
