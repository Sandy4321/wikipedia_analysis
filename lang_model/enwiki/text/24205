'''WEWS-TV''', [[virtual channel]] 5 (digital channel 15), is a television station in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. WEWS has been owned by the [[E. W. Scripps Company]] since its inception, and is an affiliate of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network. WEWS' studios are located on [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland, Ohio)|Euclid Avenue]] in downtown Cleveland, and its transmitter located in [[Parma, Ohio]].

As part of the [[DTV transition|analog television shutdown and digital conversion]], WEWS-TV shut down its analog transmitter on June 12, 2009, and continued to broadcast on its pre-transition digital channel 15.  However, through the use of [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]], digital television receivers still display the station's [[virtual channel]] as 5.

On May 23, 2010, WEWS-TV discouraged a number of viewers when their broadcast of the series finale of ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' was interrupted by a number of technical difficulties with their digital broadcast. The series finale was almost completely interrupted and unwatchable.  This caused numerous viewer complaints, and Channel 5 issued numerous apologies both on the air and through their website.

On May 26, 2011, it was announced that WEWS (along with other Scripps stations around the country) have signed a deal to air the [[Live Well Network]] (LWN) on their [[digital subchannels]]. LWN on channel 5.2 officially launched on September 5, 2011.<ref>http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/entertainment/television/wews-to-launch-live-well-network-on-5-2-digital-subchannel</ref>

== History ==
[[Image:WEWS Sign On.jpg|thumb|left|A screenshot of WEWS's sign on broadcast from December 17, 1947. This also served as the station's [[Test card|test pattern]] through the 1970s. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caK5z_n5wls] ]]
WEWS first went on the air on December 17, 1947,<ref name=stationhistory>[http://html.newsnet5.com/newschannel5/stationhistory/ Station History from WEWS Website]</ref> as the first licensed television station in [[Ohio]].  The call letters denote the initials of the parent company's founder, [[E. W. Scripps|Edward Willis Scripps]]. The station is the oldest in Cleveland to maintain the same channel position (as an analog broadcaster), ownership and call letters since its sign-on.

A few weeks before WEWS-TV's sign-on, Scripps launched WEWS-FM (102.1&nbsp;MHz., now [[WDOK]]) as an outlet for WEWS television personalities to gain on-air experience before the launch of the television station. Channel 5's first broadcast was of a Christmas pageant run by the station's corporate cousin, ''[[The Cleveland Press]]''.<ref name=stationhistory/> In short order, WEWS became the most modern television station in America.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Its staff included capable producers [[Jim Breslin]] and [[Betty Cope]], who would later become president of [[WVIZ]].

In October 1948, WEWS, still Cleveland's only television station, broadcast the [[1948 World Series]] games played in Cleveland between the [[Cleveland Indians|Indians]] and the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]].<ref name=stationhistory/>  The telecasts were fed to stations throughout the Midwest. WEWS aired only one other World Series involving the Indians - in {{wsy|1995}}, when the Indians again faced the now-Atlanta Braves - the local airing was split with [[WKYC]].

WEWS was originally a [[CBS]] affiliate, with secondary ABC and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] affiliations, but it lost the CBS affiliation to [[WJW-TV]] (channel 8) in 1955 after that station's then-owner, [[Storer Broadcasting]], used its influence with CBS to land the affiliation. It lost the DuMont affiliation when DuMont ceased operations in 1956. WEWS was also an affiliate of the short-lived [[Paramount Television Network]]; the station was one of the network's strongest affiliates, airing such Paramount programs as ''Time For Beany'',<ref name="TCT">{{cite news|date=1953-02-10|work=The Coshocton Tribune|pages=4|accessdate=26 November 2009|location=Coshocton, OH}}</ref> ''Hollywood Reel'',<ref name="HR">{{cite news|title=Television Programs|date=1952-06-25|work=East Liverpool Review|pages=12|accessdate=27 November 2009|location=East Liverpool, OH}}</ref> and ''Frosty Frolics''.<ref name="TEI">{{cite news|date=1951-09-29|work=The Evening Independent|pages=11|accessdate=30 November 2009|location=Massillon, OH}}</ref>

WEWS also aired two [[NBC]] programs, both of which had been preempted by [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Westinghouse]]-owned NBC affiliate KYW-TV (now [[WKYC-TV]]): ''[[The Huntley-Brinkley Report]]'', the network's evening newscasts, during the [[1959<U+2013>60 United States network television schedule|1959-1960 season]]; and ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', with hosts [[Jack Paar]] and later [[Johnny Carson]], from October 1957 until February 1966.<ref>http://clevelandclassicmedia.blogspot.com/2011/07/tonight-showa-cleveland-history.html</ref>

=== Local programming ===
In its early days as an ABC affiliate, the station produced its own shows in the afternoon, as ABC offered very little network programming in that daypart. Among the local programming offered during the 1950s and 1960s was news analysis from [[Dorothy Fuldheim]], children's programming featuring the "Uncle Jake" character played by Gene Carroll and the "[[Captain Penny]]" character played by [[Ron Penfound]], and exercise programs with [[Paige Palmer]]. Alice Weston had one of the first live television cooking shows, and Barbara Plummer was "Miss Barbara" for a generation of young viewers on the local version of ''[[Romper Room]]''. The most popular show was the Gene Carroll show which began in the 1948 and ran well into the 1970s. The program aired every Sunday at noon. The show showcased the local talent of Cleveland area.<ref name=stationhistory/>

WEWS also offered a 90-minute afternoon variety show ''The One O'Clock Club'' weekdays hosted by Fuldheim and Bill Gordon.<ref name=stationhistory/>  The program was so popular that competitor KYW-TV was prompted to organize a competing variety show which was the beginning of ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, WEWS produced several programs that enjoyed national exposure through [[television syndication|syndication]].  The first program was ''[[Upbeat (TV series)|Upbeat]]''.  Considered by some to be one of the most significant early rock and roll TV variety shows, ''Upbeat'' featured a live audience, a group of dancers and live (or lip-synched) performances by the big names of the era.<ref name=stationhistory/> The program began locally as ''The Big 5 Show'', and the name was changed to ''Upbeat'' when it went national, altogether running from 1964 to 1971.  Among the hosts for this program was Don Webster, who later doubled as the station's lead weather forecaster.  At its peak, ''Upbeat'' was seen in over 100 television markets. Artists who appeared on ''Upbeat'' included [[Aretha Franklin]], [[the Beatles]], [[Simon and Garfunkel]], [[Otis Redding]] and [[Stevie Wonder]], among others.  In fact, Redding's final appearance ever came on the show on December 9, 1967.  The next afternoon, his twin-engine airplane crashed in the icy waters of [[Lake Monona]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], killing all but one of the eight passengers on board.   

Another program seen throughout the country was ''Polka Varieties'', an hour-long program of [[polka music]]<ref name=stationhistory/> that ran locally on Sunday afternoons from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. from 1956 into the early 1980s, and was syndicated during its later years to 30 television markets. The program featured various popular bands that played [[Slovenian-style polka]],  [[Poland|Polish]], [[Italian culture|Italian]] and [[Bohemian]]-style music. "America's Polka King", [[Frank Yankovic]], was the original band to perform on the show. Other bands included Richie Vadnal, George Staiduhar, Markic-Zagger, and Hank Haller.  Original host Tom Fletcher was replaced by Paul Wilcox, whose presence became an indelible part of the show.  Uttering the well-known show-opening phrase, "From America's Polka Capital of Cleveland, Ohio, this is Polka Varieties, now in its ___ year on the air!" were several famous voices associated with the station over the years, including Cort Stanton, Ralph Gunderman, and David Mark. ''Black On Black'', which examined issues of importance to Black communities, was syndicated to several markets.

In 1970, WEWS became the broadcast rights holder of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], and ABC held the NBA's national rights at the time.  Channel 5's partnership with the team continued until 1973, when the Cavaliers moved to then-independent station [[WUAB]] (channel 43), coincidentally, after the NBA moved from ABC to CBS. On December 17, 2007, channel 5 reached a major milestone -- the station celebrated its sixtieth anniversary on the air.

From the early 1970s until July 1, 2011, WEWS was Cleveland's television outlet for the [[Ohio Lottery]]. On June 2, 2011, [[NBC]] affiliate [[WKYC]] (channel 3) announced that they had acquired the rights to air the lottery drawings. as well as its Saturday night game show ''[[Cash Explosion]]''. WKYC's affiliation with the Lottery officially began on July 1, 2011.<ref>http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/192237/45/WKYC-is-new-Ohio-Lottery-partner-will-air-drawings</ref>

=== WEWS vs. WAKR/WAKC ===
At one time, the Cleveland/Akron market had two ABC affiliates: in addition to WEWS, WAKR-TV served viewers in Akron and [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] who could not receive a clear signal from WEWS. WAKR was founded in 1953, six years after WEWS, and was stuck with a less-desirable UHF signal instead of a VHF signal following the FCC's 1952 ''Sixth Report and Order'', which resulted in a realignment of television allocations in the Midwest.  WAKR-TV gained an ABC affiliation as the network could not clear its full schedule on its then-primary station in Cleveland, WXEL (as WJW-TV was known then), and retained it after ABC moved full-time to WEWS in 1955.  As ABC soon became on equal footing with CBS and NBC in the late 1960s, this did cause cannibalization of ratings and made WEWS brass angry; they did not want to compete with another station showing the same programming.

The E.W. Scripps Company, the owners of WEWS, would always petition ABC's decision to allow both stations to carry the same programming. In the 1960s, ABC allowed WEWS to broadcast the better shows, leaving WAKR-TV with the less popular shows and second-rate syndicated programs. Meanwhile, WAKR-TV would air ABC shows that WEWS would preempt for movies or other assorted programming, and cleared the entire ABC schedule. One notable program preempted by both stations was the very first ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game, which involved the hometown [[Cleveland Browns|Browns]] hosting the [[New York Jets]], which the Browns won 31-21. Both stations had to preempt the game (and all other Monday night games hosted by the Browns through the end of 1972) because the [[National Football League|NFL]] did not allow local telecasts of even sold-out home games at the time, something that changed in 1973. {{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

It was the popularity and financial success of WAKR-TV's [[WAKR|sister radio station]] that kept the TV station afloat, which was severed when the radio stations were spun off and WAKR-TV became WAKC. Into the 1990s, while WEWS carried first-run programming like ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', and ''[[Live with Regis and Kathie Lee]]'', WAKC was left with ''[[The 700 Club]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'', ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' and infomercials in the [[Prime Time Access Rule|7:00 p.m. hour]]. In addition, WAKC's newscasts struggled in ratings even in Akron, often being beaten by WEWS.

The feud ended in May 1996, when WAKC canceled its news operation after being purchased by [[Ion Media Networks|Paxson Communications]] and dropped all ABC programming in December 1996 to air infomercials and religious programming under the [[WVPX-TV]] call letters. It would eventually settle in as the Cleveland/Akron market's outlet for the Pax TV network, which is now [[Ion Television]]. Despite this, WAKR/WAKC became a "farm station" of sorts for TV 5; its most notable alumni were Ted Henry - who was a weather anchor at WAKR prior to his long association with WEWS, and Mark Johnson - former WAKC [[meteorologist]] who has been with WEWS since 1997.

=== ''The Morning Exchange'' ===
{{Main|The Morning Exchange}}
One program in particular, ''The Morning Exchange'', which ran from 1972 until 1999, changed the face of morning television.  It was the first morning show to utilize a "living room" set, and the first to establish the now familiar concept of news and weather at the top and bottom of the hour.  During its peak in the 1970s, nearly 70 percent of all television sets in Cleveland were tuned to the program. The format also served as a template for ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]''.<ref name=stationhistory/>

==Logos and imaging==
===Logos===
From sometime in 1968 until 1998, WEWS' logo was known as the ''Circle 5'', a variant of the [[Circle 7 logo|''Circle 7'' logo]] associated mainly with the original five ABC [[owned-and-operated]] stations (such as [[WXYZ-TV]] in [[Detroit]], now owned by E.W. Scripps).  The only real change to the logo came in 1995, when it was slightly tilted to the right. Initially sister station [[WPTV]] in [[West Palm Beach]] also used the same logo, but in August 2008 they also slightly modified theirs from the original.

In 1970, the station commissioned musician and jingle writer [[Frank Gari]] to create a promotional campaign song. ''Catch 5'', as it was known, caught on in Cleveland. The ''Catch 5'' promo was first used to highlight the then-new John Hambrick/Dave Patterson anchor team on ''Eyewitness News''.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv55lReyf2w WEWS TV "Catch 5" Local News Promo from the 1970s.] Accessed May 25, 2009.</ref> WEWS kept ''Catch 5'' as its official slogan until 1977. The station then transitioned towards a localized version of ABC network campaigns and Gari's "Hello News" campaign ("Hello Cleveland") for its on-air imaging, and as the theme for ''Live on Five''. By the mid-1980s, only the ''Eyewitness News'' broadcasts kept the ''Catch 5'' theme music. In 1986, WEWS dropped the ''Catch 5'' musical theme altogether and adopted another Gari music package, "Good News". Finally, in 1987, the "Hello" news theme and image campaign were dropped and replaced with one of the versions of "Good News". 

While WEWS was positioned on-air as either "TV5" or "Channel 5" up until 1990, the "Newschannel 5" branding was initially interchanged with "WEWS Channel 5" before eventually being extended to all broadcasting dayparts, including daytime and prime-time.

In January 2007, to coincide with their debut of high-definition newscasts, WEWS returned to a slightly modified version of the old ''Circle 5''.<ref>[http://www.newsnet5.com/news/10689501/detail.html]</ref> By September 2008, the ABC logo was gradually integrated onto the "Circle 5" first on occasional promos (including a harmonization of ABC's "Start Here" campaign), then with all newscast opens on March 2009, and with the on-screen 'bug' on April 20, 2009. Unlike the ABC O&O stations, WEWS embeds the ABC logo to the right of the "Circle #" logo and not the left, a distinction shared by [[Detroit|Detroit's]] [[WXYZ-TV]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo's]] [[WTVG-TV]], and [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh's]] [[WTAE-TV]]. By late May 2009, the station still refers to their newscasts as "Newschannel 5" but on-air promos and other imaging outside of newscasts refer to the station as "Channel 5."

===Imaging===
In addition to the Catch 5 campaign, WEWS also had several customized versions of the ABC campaigns from the from the early 1970s to 1992, as well as other localized campaigns, including ABC's most recent slogan, 'Start Here,' which the station localized from 2008-2010.

==News operation==
Currently, WEWS broadcasts a total of 31<U+00BD> hours of newscasts per week (with 5<U+00BD> hours of newscasts on Monday-Fridays, 3 hours on Saturday and one hour on Sundays). Channel 5 also features the weekly sports highlight program ''Sports Sunday'', hosted by sports director Andy Baskin, Sunday nights at 11:35 p.m., as well as ''Kaleidoscope'', a weekly public affairs/talk program hosted by [[Leon Bibb]].

===Early history===
WEWS started covering news events soon after it went on air. The winter after it went on air, Cleveland experienced a blizzard, and for the first time WEWS had extended coverage for hours. During the early and mid-1950s, channel 5's first newscasts and weather reports were delivered by Tom Field. In 1959 Dorothy Fuldheim, who had been with the station before it even went on air, began to formulate her own newscast in response to the new 30-minute newscast on KYW-TV, the first half-hour newscast in the country.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Fuldheim utterly hated hard-hitting newscasts such as the one KYW-TV had created.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  Instead, she centered her newscast around her interviews, a general overview of the news, and her commentaries (the very opinionated Fuldheim frequently inserted her own opinions about the stories). Fuldheim was the first female in the United States to have her own television news analysis program.

27-year-old [[John Hambrick]] took over as lead anchor on WEWS' evening newscasts on [[Christmas Day]] in December 1967, with Fuldheim staying on as a commentator.  Don Webster presented the weather and [[Gib Shanley]] was the sports anchor. In 1968, WEWS changed the format of its newscasts slightly to a version of ''[[Eyewitness News]]''. In 1970, Dave Patterson joined Hambrick on the early newscast and then became co-anchor on the 11:00 p.m. newscast in 1971. [[Ted Henry]], who joined WEWS in 1972 as a behind-the-scenes producer, got his start on the air later in 1975 as a weekend weatherman. (In later years, Henry would admit that he, not knowing the slightest about forecasting, simply made up the forecast every day.<ref>{{cite news |first=Julie E. |last=Washington |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Cleveland's Ted Henry reflects on 40 years in broadcasting |url=http://www.cleveland.com/tv/index.ssf/2009/05/clevelands_ted_henry_reflects.html |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |publisher= |date=2009-05-17 |accessdate=2009-05-19 }} Prior to joining WEWS, Henry worked on-air at several stations in Canton, Akron and Youngstown, and also as a weatherman at [[WVPX|WAKR-TV]].</ref>

In that same year, Bill Jacocks, said to be Cleveland's first regularly scheduled [[African-American]] anchorman,<ref>Feran, T, Heldenfels, R.D.: "Cleveland TV Memories", mem# 364, Gray & Company, Publishers 1999</ref> joined WEWS. Jacocks started as assistant public affairs director, and became weekend anchor in January 1975. For a solid decade (until 1985) Jacocks remained the one constant weekend anchor while many co-anchors came and went. Among those doing their first Cleveland co-anchor stints with Jacocks were [[Tim Taylor (newscaster)|Tim Taylor]] and [[Wilma Smith (newscaster)|Wilma Smith]].

Hambrick and Patterson continued to anchor the newscasts together until Hambrick left for [[KABC-TV]] in [[Los Angeles]] in 1975.  At that time, Ted Henry became the weekend anchor, and then a year later in 1976, co-anchor on the weekday evening newscasts with Patterson. Henry continued as the lead anchor until his retirement on May 20, 2009.<ref>{{cite news |first=Julie E. |last=Washington |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Ted Henry, longtime local anchor, to retire |url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2009/04/longtime_local_anchor_ted_henr.html |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |publisher= |date=2009-04-23 |accessdate=2009-04-24 }}</ref>

This era marked the start of dominance for the WEWS news programs that lasted until well into the 1980s.  In 1977 weekend co-anchor Tim Taylor left WEWS for weeknight anchor duties at WJW-TV. Fuldheim<U+2019>s role decreased as she only presented her interviews and commentaries, but still appeared on the air three times every day until retiring in July 1984 at the age of 91. WEWS's news department underwent another major change in 1982. Previously, the 5-6 p.m. spot was occupied by ''The Afternoon Exchange'', the afternoon companion to ''The Morning Exchange''. That year, the program adopted a new format, and was renamed ''Live on Five''.  The broadcast was originally hosted by Wilma Smith and Don Webster, and retained many elements from ''The Afternoon Exchange'', such as interviews, movie reviews, health reports, and some cooking segments. Added to the mix were news updates from Ted Henry.

=== Evolution of the news department ===
[[Image:WEWS24HourNewsSource.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An 24 Hour NewsSource update circa 1991-1994. These updates are best remembered by the clock in the picture displaying the current time.]]
As WJW's news programs became more and more successful during the 1980s,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} (as well as CBS having better ratings than ABC during most of the 1980s) channel 5 began facing competition for the first time in years.  According to Ted Henry,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} towards the end of the 1980s, management felt that the station could produce a better newscast and overcome WJW by using a format other than ''Eyewitness News''.  An outside source was brought in and concurred that the station could do a better job in news production by adapting a new format.  The analysis added that the ''Eyewitness News'' format gave nothing to viewers which suggested that its news was any better than the other stations'.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  With this in mind, WEWS began developing a format which would involve the production of full newscasts at the regular time slots, and in addition, mini-newscasts at the top of every hour, even overnight.  This concept was dubbed "The [[24 Hour News Source|24 Hour NewsSource]]" as a way to suggest that WEWS was better than other stations since it produced a newscast every hour.  In 1990, the new format was put into place and the station began identifying itself as "NewsChannel 5" (a title it shares with [[NewsChannel 5 (disambiguation)|several stations in other markets]]).

From 1990 until 1993, WEWS and WJW continued battling for the top rated spot.  In 1993, WEWS launched a successful campaign called "Together" which reminded viewers of the station's commitment to Cleveland through news and programming since its 1947 launch and that that same commitment was present today.  The campaign also slightly toned down the newscasts by making them less hard-hitting (and more family-friendly, as ABC had been seen as a "family network" in the early to mid '90s).  As a result, WEWS once again emerged as the market leader in news.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  In 1994, WJW became a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate and adopted a more hard-hitting format for its newscasts, going with Fox's "edgier" reputation and style, leading to many of its viewers changing channels to WEWS.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Meanwhile, WKYC-TV and [[WOIO]] (channel 19, the new [[CBS]] affiliate) failed to present much substantial competition at all.  However, WJW soon began regaining viewers due to the fact that it was able to produce longer local newscasts since Fox had less programming than the other networks.  In response, WEWS began promoting its news division as "The most-watched news team in Ohio" in hope that the [[bandwagon effect]] would keep viewers tuned to its newscasts.  In 1997, WEWS began to lose more viewers,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} this time to WKYC, when former WUAB anchor Romona Robinson moved to WKYC. At this time WEWS discontinued its hourly <U+201C>24 Hour NewsSource<U+201D> updates.

To try to prevent more viewers from leaving, WEWS got a new set and a new newsroom in 1998 and adopted "On Your Side" as its slogan (which it currently still uses). More noticeable, however, was the dropping of the station's longtime ''Circle 5'' logo.  That year, WEWS also became the first TV station in Cleveland to launch a website [http://www.newsnet5.com NewsNet5]. WEWS won many well-deserved national awards between 2000 and 2004.  The station boldly replaced prime time programs with town hall meetings, and was credited with saving steel mills and local hosptials. While WEWS built on its outstanding news legacy in the early 2000s, winning most primary ratings races, revenue issues dogged the station. Commercial-heavy newscasts and prime time lacking news promotion took a toll. At the same time ABC prime lead ins fell into last place.  As a result the station's 11 p.m. newscast ended a four-year run at number one, and lost by a share point to WOIO. The trend continued in late news for the next several years.

On January 7, 2007, WEWS began broadcasting newscasts in [[High-definition television|high-definition]], becoming the third Cleveland television station to do so.  At this present time, all locally produced portions of the WEWS newscasts, including live remote field footage, are in high definition. On May 21, 2009, Ted Henry retired as the primary news anchor at channel 5, after holding the post for 33 years.  Henry is the longest serving news anchor in Cleveland TV history, and second in Ohio to former WJW-TV/WKYC-TV news anchor [[Doug Adair]], whose combined work in Cleveland and at [[WCMH-TV]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] spanned 36 years.

On October 19, 2009, WEWS upgraded its graphics and music packages for all its newscasts to the standard issue format currently used by all Scripps stations. The station changed to a new website format to match on February 24, 2010. The new WEWS website is an in-house operation (the previous website was operated by [[Internet Broadcasting]]). The websites of the other Scripps stations (which were previously operated by [[Inergize Digital Media|Inergize Digital]]) followed suit three months later.

On August 4, 2010, weekend sports anchor Terry Brooks made headlines when he was indicted in a Cleveland court on [[rape]] and [[kidnapping]] charges. Brooks was then placed on administrative leave. On October 9, 2010, Brooks resigned from WEWS.<ref>[http://ohiomediawatch.wordpress.com]</ref> On January 27, 2011, Brooks was found not guilty on all counts associated with his trial.<ref>[http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/cleveland_metro/former-wews-sports-anchor-terry-brooks-found-not-guilty-of-all-rape-kidnapping-charges]</ref>

The station is readily available over-the-air to [[Kingsville, Ontario|Kingsville]], [[Leamington, Ontario|Leamington]], and [[Pelee Island]], and was once one of the three stations from Cleveland carried on local cable in those three locations (The others being WKYC-TV and WJW-TV, until 2000 when [[Cogeco]] displaced [[Shaw Cable]] as the cable provider for [[Essex County, Ontario|Essex County.]] WEWS was also on cable in [[London, Ontario]], carried until December 1969 by the London Cable TV system (now Rogers) in most of London, and until 1977 by the Maclean-Hunter system (also now Rogers) in the southwest third of the city; LCTV replaced the station with fellow ABC affiliate [[WJET-TV]] from [[Erie, Pennsylvania]].

On October 16, 2009, the [[Windsor Star]] had notified readers that digital subchannels of the Detroit and Toledo stations would be added, while the Cleveland stations (such as WEWS-TV) and some Toledo stations would have to be dropped from the listings to make room for them, starting with the next issue of the TV Times, released [[October 17|the next day]].  The only Cleveland local station remaining in the Windsor-area TV Times is WUAB.
