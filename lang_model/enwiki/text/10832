'''Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia''' ({{lang-ru|<U+041E><U+0301><U+043B><U+044C><U+0433><U+0430> <U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0430><U+0301><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0420><U+043E><U+043C><U+0430><U+0301><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430>}}; ''Olga Alexandrovna Romanova'') ([[June 13]], [[1882]]&ndash;[[November 24]], [[1960]]) was the last Grand Duchess of Imperial Russia under the reign of her elder brother, [[Czar Nicholas II]]. Her father was the 19th century reformer of Imperial Russia, Czar [[Alexander III of Russia]]; her mother the daughter of [[Christian IX of Denmark]], [[Maria Feodorovna]], formerly Princess Dagmar of [[Denmark]]. Raised at the [[Gatchina]] Palace of [[St. Petersburg, Russia]], the young Grand Duchess was closest to her brother, "Misha", [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia]].

The Grand Duchess was an accomplished painter and was responsible for the creation of over 2,000 works of art. She was the last direct, remaining heir to the [[House of Romanov]] until her death in late 1960. During her incumbency, she was styled '''Her Imperial Highness (HIH), Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna Romanov of Imperial Russia'''.

After the downfall of the [[Romanov]]s, she, her mother, and other relatives, were imprisoned in the Republic of [[Crimea]]. During a political upheaval within the [[ad interim]], revolutionary government, the remaining family escaped to [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]. Upon the death of her mother in 1928, the Grand Duchess and her husband, Nikolai Kulikovsky, moved to a farm near Copenhagen. During spring of 1948, the family evacuated to rural [[Cooksville, Ontario]] near [[Toronto]], [[Canada]], due to threats from the regime of [[Josef Stalin]] in [[Russia]]. While she lived in Canada, due to security concerns and for the sake of privacy, she was styled '''Olga Alexandrovna Kulikovsky'''. However, her [[Canadian]] descendants have revived the [[Romanov]] surname and are now addressed as '''Kulikovsky-Romanoff'''.

==Early life==
[[Image:OlgaCards7.jpg|left|thumb|310px|Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Imperial Russia at right, Czar Nicholas II (center), and their mother (at left).]]
Born on [[June 13]], [[1882]] in the [[Peterhof]] Palace, west of [[St. Petersburg]] in [[Peterhof, Russia]], she was the youngest daughter of [[Alexander III of Russia|Tsar Alexander III]] and his spouse, Empress [[Maria Feodorovna]], formerly Princess Dagmar of [[Denmark]]. Because she was born during her father's reign, she is described as a porphyrogenite child, a Greek term used in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. The Grand Duchess was raised at [[Gatchina]] Palace, within the environs of the Imperial Palaces of [[St. Petersburg, Russia]]. The Gatchina was her childhood home and throughout her life the Grand Duchess would reflect on those memories as the "best" time of her life.<ref>{{cite web|last=Atchison|first=Bob |date=2004|url=http://www.alexanderpalace.org/palace/Olga.html|title=Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna|format=HTML|accessdate=2006-07-20}}</ref>
However, Olga Alexandrovna and her siblings were not accustomed to a lavish early lifestyle, as modest, [[Spartan]] living and the strictest of discipline was required by their tutors, governesses, and parents. The Gatchina Palace Organization's reference best described the living conditions of the young [[Romanov]]s: {{cquote|The magnificence of the imperial suites did not, however, trickle down to the children's quarters. The Tsar's children slept on a firm bed with a hard, flat pillow and a very narrow mattress. A modest rug covered the floor. Straight-backed wicker chairs, the most ordinary of tables and bookshelves, needlework and toys, made up the only furnishings. A single precious object sat in the beautiful corner (icon corner): a silver-framed icon of the Blessed Mother of God, studded with pearls and other precious stones.[http://history.gatchina.ru/palace/olga/olga2e.htm]}}[[Image:childrensroom.jpg|right|thumb|330px|''Breakfast in the Children's Room'' (1898), drawing by the Grand Duchess at the age of 16]]

Many of these implementations were commenced by the childrens' paternal grandmother, [[Marie of Hesse and by Rhine]], who also introduced [[England|English]] customs to the [[Russia]]n [[court]], including the obligatory cold water bath in the morning, oatmeal porridge for breakfast, and an essential fresh air constitutional. The education system by which the Grand Duchess and her siblings were taught was of the highest standards. Royal tutors taught in depth the core subjects, such as the [[Russian language]], [[Literature]], [[Mathematics]], [[History]], and [[Language]]s. Although her siblings were taught in the same room, the "Children's" room (above right), her older brother, Nicholas, was being taught a different level of skills. The customary and traditional skills Nicholas was required to learn as [[Heir Apparent]] to the Throne were more urgent and necessary to learn than the lessons the other siblings were taught. Physical activities such as [[Equestrianism]] were also taught at an early age, eventually making the young [[Romanov]]s riding experts. [[Image:duchessolgachild.jpg|left|thumb|330px|The Grand Duchess in her early years at the [[Gatchina]] Palace in [[St. Petersburg, Russia]]]]The young Grand Duchess vacationed at ''Olgino'', her estate in the province of [[Voronezh]], southwestern [[Russia]]. There she practiced and exemplified her faith, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], by creating religious [[icon]]s and blessing the village buildings and people. There she painted and drew many of her original works, later to be sold to neighbors and friends in rural [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. [[Equestrianism]], [[hiking]], and [[swimming]] were also main activities at Olgino. The Grand Duchess developed a close relationship with the people of the village, adjacent to her estate, but the relationship withered during the events leading to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]].

The Grand Duchess was described as being indifferent to the fine gemstones and expensive [[jewellery]] which remains identifiable with the [[House of Romanov]] during the reign of both her brother and father. Throughout her early life, the young [[Romanov]] amassed a near [[priceless]] collection of gems and jewellery, which were soonafter confiscated by the Russian revolutionaries. The fondness between the Grand Duchess and her father were also a defining chapter in the life of the last reigning [[Romanov]], as the two of them along with her brother, Mikhail, held close relationships. Together, the three proved to be [[camping]] enthusiasts and would frequently go on [[Hiking|hikes]] within the [[Gatchina]] Palace and the area forests.[http://www.alexanderpalace.org/palace/Olga.html] But on [[November 1]], [[1894]], the Grand Duchess' father, [[Alexander III of Russia]], died at the untimely age of [[49]]. The emotional impact the young [[Romanov]] experienced at the age of only 12 was tragic, as the family began to encounter the political ordeal which quickly ensued.

==Painter and philanthropist==
[[Image:villageautumn.jpg|right|thumb|330px|''Village Church in Autumn'' (1920), watercolor painting by the Grand Duchess]]

The Grand Duchess began drawing and painting at a young age, however, it was not until her later teenage years when her artistic abilities began to prosper. She also had a philanthropic side, founding charity programs in the village of Olgino, adjacent to her estate, and improved basic [[medical]] and educational options for the local citizenry. She also protected and was the patroness of many charitable organizations and establishments from an early age. She was, for the most part, benefactress to orphanages, hospitals, poorhouses and schools for girls. She gave considerable help to poor, but talented artists, and many destitute Russians sought help from her personally. Her benefaction in rural Olgino sparked many foundations to begin humanitarian support for the poor of the [[Russian Empire]]. At Olgino, she subsidized the village school out of her own pocket, established and visited the National Hospital in the village, and continued smaller, but considerable contributions to the most povertous of the [[regional]] townships. At the hospital, she learned how to administer medical treatment and proper care of the [[ill]] from the local [[Physician|doctor]]. Through further medical training, the Grand Duchess was able to become a [[nurse]], a capability which would later in life be extremely valuable. The Grand Duchess continued support for the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and the [[church]] services held at Olgino. Even at Olgino, she was required to complete her daily educational lessons, which were usually intertwined with drawing or painting.

{{cquote|Even during my geography and arithmetic lessons, I was allowed to sit with a pencil in my hand. I could listen much better when I was drawing corn or wild flowers.[http://history.gatchina.ru/palace/olga/olga7e.htm]}}Throughout her life, she created a vast collection of artwork developed in [[Russia]], [[Denmark]], and later [[Canada]], which soon amassed to a collection of over 2,000 pieces. In Russia and Denmark, her preferred art medium, [[scenery]] and [[landscape]], continued to be prominently depicted in almost every one of her paintings created in [[Canada]]. The Grand Duchess also found her paintings to be a profitable source of income, selling many of her works upon completion in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]. The young [[Romanov]] also praised the landscape of her [[Canadian]] surroundings, expressing them in a series of letters to her [[Denmark|Danish]] friend, Alexandra Mikhailovna Iskra: 
{{cquote|It was a wonderful evening, everything smelled so sweet. In the forests, it smelled just like in Russia with the birch and all kinds of trees in bloom. Then, when we were driving by homes and gardens of some friends, we saw them and got out of the car. What a beautiful garden they have! Lily of the valley, lilac and all kinds of plants scented the air. We walked through the gardens surrounding the house and on the other side we saw a deep ravine all covered with forest. We could see far off into the distance.[http://history.gatchina.ru/palace/olga/olga7e.htm]}}

==Tsarskoye Selo==
[[Image:romanovrussia.jpg|right|thumb|280px|The Grand Duchess and her then husband, [[Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg]], in 1901. Their questionable, unconsummated marriage ended in divorce fifteen years later.]]

At the age of nineteen, on [[August 9]], [[1901]], the Grand Duchess married into the famed [[European]] [[aristocracy]] of the [[House of Oldenburg]], marrying [[Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg]]. The [[matrimony]] between the two royals was unconsummated, but the union continued and Oldenburg, with his newlywed, was thereafter assigned to live in [[Tsarskoye Selo]], an epic complex of palaces south of [[St. Petersburg, Russia]]. The Grand Duchess was very agreeable to the relocation, as her good friend and brother, Nicholas, and his spouse, Alexandra, would be living at the [[Alexander Palace]] in close proximity to their own residence. As of 1901, the Grand Duchess was appointed as honorary [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the 12th Akhtyrsky Hussar Regiment of the Imperial Russian Forces. The Akhtyrsky Hussar, famous for its coalesced victory over [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] at the [[Battle of Kulm]] in 1813, is the only Russian force with the right to forever wear the distinguished Brown Doloman uniform.  

In the year 1903, she was introduced to Colonel Nikolai Alexandrovich Kulikovsky by her beloved brother, Mikhail ("Misha"), during a royal military review at [[Pavlovsk]]. Soonafter, an open love affair between the Grand Duchess and the Army [[Colonel]] emanated. The same year, at the age of 22, she confronted her arranged spouse and asked for an immediate divorce. Her brother, [[Czar Nicholas II]], believed the relationship with Kulikovsky to be a fleeting romance and agreed to allow [[Divorce]] within seven years. However, Oldenberg appointed Kulikovsky as an [[aide-de-camp]] and allowed him to abide in the same residence of the Grand Duchess on the prestigious Sergievskaya street of [[Tsarskoye Selo]].  For those who knew, the relationship between Kulikovsky and the Grand Duchess was a guarded secret, especially from the [[Romanov]] family patriarchs.  However, many influential members of the family were informed of the secret relationship, yet did nothing to show disapproval. In living at [[Tsarskoye Selo]], the Grand Duchess also became very close with her nieces and nephew, the daughters and son of her venerated brother, the [[Czar]]. She especially took a liking to the youngest of Nicholas' daughters, Anastasia, whom she and other family members called "Shvibzik" (imp), a mischievous child.  [[Image:Premazzi.jpg|left|thumb|295px|Neoclassical architecture of Tsarskoye Selo]]The connection between the four daughters and the Grand Duchess was prized even to the point of her taking her nieces to parties in [[St. Petersburg]].  She was deeply trusted by both the Czar and Czarina, as evidenced by the Grand Duchess' forays with her nieces to the parties and engagements throughout the palaces of [[St. Petersburg]]. The Czar and Empress were considered overly protective parents and trusted few with the care of their children, the future of Russia.

The Akhtyrsky Hussar Regiment, in the summer of 1914, appeared for an Imperial Review by [[Czar Nicholas II]] at the [[Alexander Palace]] in [[Tsarskoye Selo]]. When [[World War I]] erupted the same year, Kulikovsky was commissioned to command the regiment at the frontlines in Southwestern Russia. With the Grand Duchess' prior medical knowledge from the village of Olgino, she signed on as a Sister of Charity with her own regiment in [[Proskurov]], [[Russia]]. At the same time, internal tensions in Russia began to mount as the revolutionary call grew louder. During the first year of the war, the Grand Duchess came upon heavy [[Austria|Austrian]] fire. The Sisters of Charity rarely worked so close to the frontlines and consequently the Grand Duchess was awarded the [[Order of St. George]] for heroic actions.

==The Fall of the House of Romanov==

In 1916, [[Czar Nicholas II]] officially annulled the marriage between [[Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg]] and the Grand Duchess, allowing her to marry Colonel Nikolai Alexandrovich Kulikovsky on [[November 14]], [[1916]], in the Church of St. Nicholas in [[Kiev]] (present-day capital of the [[Ukraine]]). Among those in attendance were Dowager Empress [[Maria Fyodorovna]], her older sister, [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia]], her sister's husband, [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexander "Sandro"]], the officers of the Akhtyrsky Regiment, and the Sisters of Charity from the hospital in [[Kiev]] founded by the Grand Duchess. When Russian revolutionaries began to gather the family of [[Czar Nicholas II]] in contained locations, the Dowager Empress, the Grand Duchess Xenia, and the Grand Duchess Olga were also imprisoned, but in a different locale, the [[Crimea]].  On [[February 12]], [[1917]], her first child and son, Tikhon Nikolaevich Kulikovsky was born into the world as a royal prisoner under the Provisional government of Russia. He was named after the local, venerated [[Saint]] near the Grand Duchess' estate at Olgino, Tihon of Zadonsk. Due to the communications blackout the entirety of Russia began to experience and because of the material censorship the Grand Duchess was exposed to, little was known of the fate of her brother and family. Nicholas, Alexandra, and their children, were originally held at their official residence, the [[Alexander Palace]], but fearing a counter-revolution, the Provisional government under [[Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky]] relocated the Imperial Family to [[Tobolsk]], [[Siberia]]. [[Image:anaolgaatatia1914.jpg|left|thumb|340px|[[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]] (left), Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna (center), and [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia]] (right); at a Russian beach, 1914]]While in the [[Crimea]], the Grand Duchess' family had been condemned to death by the [[Sevastopol]] and [[Yalta]] revolutionary councils. During a mild political upheaval between the two factions, the Central Power of [[Germany]] advanced on the [[Crimea]], but upon arrival in November 1918, the German forces were informed of their nation's loss of the war. Shortly after the brief [[Germany|German]] occupation of the [[Crimea]], the loyalist [[White Army]] temporarily restored the area to an intermediate level of safety, allowing the Grand Duchess and her family to escape. [[George V of England]] sent the warship [[HMS Marlborough]] to retrieve his aunt, the Dowager Empress [[Maria Fyodorovna]] and the Grand Duchesses from the unstable [[Crimea]]. An agreement was made between the Dowager Empress and George V to evacuate all Russian citizens who wished to go abroad.  The communications [[blackout]] the family had experienced at the [[Crimea]] was relieved by the [[England|English]] sailors aboard the ''Marlborough''. The Grand Duchess was told of her older brother's confirmed assassination and the assumed deaths of her sister-in-law, nieces, and nephew. The fate of her childhood confidant and brother, "Misha", [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia]], the one-time unofficial Emperor of Imperial Russia, was also uncertain. It was unknown to the Grand Duchess at the time, but the Grand Duke had been assassinated by the [[Cheka]] in [[Perm Krai]], [[Russia]] on [[June 12]], [[1918]], motivated by fears of a [[Romanov]] return to power.
[[Image:romanovfamily.jpg|left|thumb|340px|Grand Duchess Olga with her husband, Nikolai, and her new-born son, Tihon, at the [[Crimea]], 1917]]

The Grand Duchess Olga and her husband, Colonel Kulikovsky, refused to leave [[Russia]] at that time. The two decided to leave for the [[Kuban]], then still free of [[Bolsheviks]], to the large [[Cossack]] village of Novominskaya, where Timofei Yatchik, bodyguard of the Dowager Empress, was from. In a rented farmhouse around the [[Spring (season)|Spring]] of 1919, their second son, Juri Nikolaevich Kulikovsky (also spelled Guri), was born. Named after one of the Grand Duchess' close friends during [[World War I]], Gury Panayev, a proclaimed battle hero who had fallen in 1914 serving in the Akhtyrsky Regiment. Soon after the birth of her second son, inner circles of the monarchist [[White Army]] approached the Grand Duchess with offers to officially coronate her as [[Empress]] of Imperial Russia, however, she declined. With the Grand Duchess Olga being the last [[Heir Apparent]] to the Imperial Throne in [[Russia]], she immediately became targeted by the expedient [[Red Army]]. The family set out on what would be their last journey through [[Russia]]; they escaped to [[Rostov-on-Don]], taking refuge in the residence of the Danish [[Consul]], Thomas Nikolaevich Schutte, who informed them of the Dowager Empress' safe arrival in [[Denmark]]. After a brief stay with the Danish consul, the family then escaped to the island of [[B<U+00FC>y<U+00FC>kada]] in the [[Dardanelles]] Strait near [[Istanbul, Turkey]]. Evacuating next to [[Belgrade]] in the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] where she was visited by Regent Alexander Karageorgevich, later to become [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]]. The [[Regent]] recommended that the Grand Duchess and her family permanently live on one of the royal [[Estate (house)|estate]]s of the former [[Austro-Hungarian]] territory, while the Dowager Empress immediately summoned her daughter to live on her royal estate in [[Denmark]]. The Grand Duchess immediately complied and the family relocated once again to [[Denmark]]. Sadly, the Dowager Empress, [[Maria Fyodorovna]], died there on [[October 13]], [[1928]].

==Danish residency and exodus==
[[Image:knuds-minde.jpg|right|thumb|310px|Knuds-Minde Farm, Denmark, 1930s]]

The Grand Duchess and her family left the Royal Estate of her late mother, moving to ''Knuds-Minde'' Farm, several miles outside of [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]. Her farm-estate became the center of the [[Russia]]n [[monarchist]] community in [[Denmark]] and the place of visitation for many Russian [[emigrant]]s. She maintained a high level of correspondence with officers of the Equipage of the Guard, escorts, [[cuirassier]]s, members of the Akhtyrsky Regiment, Rifles of the Imperial Family, and the [[Danish monarchy]], her cousins. She began to sell her collection of art from her childhood in [[Russia]], with exhibition auctions in [[Copenhagen]], [[London]], [[Paris]], and [[Berlin]]. A portion of the [[net income]] the Grand Duchess received from the auctions were donated to various Russian charities.

On [[April 9]], [[1940]], neutral [[Denmark]] was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]] and consequently became an occupied country throughout [[World War II]]. Food shortages, communication censorship, and transportation closures resulted in a large group of impoverished [[Danes]]. Her sons, Tikhon and Juri, served as officers in the [[Danish Army]] before [[Denmark]] was invaded, and because of this the two [[Romanov]]s were imprisoned in a more [[liberal]] form of [[concentration camp]].[[Image:royaldanishguard2.jpg|left|thumb|300px|''Royal Danish Guard'' (1935). The Grand Duchess' painting of a patrolling guard in the Royal Danish Forces]]The [[Romanov]]s luck changed for the better on [[May 5]], [[1945]], when [[Nazi Germany]] surrendered to [[The United States]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[the Soviet Union]]. When the economic condition of [[Denmark]] refused to improve, General [[Pyotr Krasnov]] wrote to the Grand Duchess, detailing the wretched conditions affecting poor citizens of Russia and Russian immigrants living in [[Denmark]]. She immediately corresponded with Prince Axel of Denmark concerning the economic struggle of [[Russia]] and he promised to send [[aid]] to the poor of Russia, especially the [[Cossacks]]. 

[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]-controlled [[Russia]] proved to be a dangerous neighbor to the [[Romanov]] family as a letter was sent to the Danish government accusing the Grand Duchess and a Danish Catholic [[bishop]] of [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against the new [[Soviet]] government. When [[Soviet]] troops built up near the border of [[Denmark]] and the possibility of an assassination-attempt against the [[Romanov]]s grew, the Grand Duchess decided to evacuate the family to a farm in rural [[Campbellville, Ontario]], [[Canada]].

===The interview with Anna Anderson===

[[Image:Annaan.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Anna Anderson]]

In 1920, [[Anna Anderson]], later known as Anastasia Manahan, jumped into the icy waters of the Landwehr Canal in [[Berlin, Germany]] in an assumed suicidal attempt. There she claimed that she was Olga's godchild, [[Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia]]. While the details remain sketchy and at the very least controversial, the 20-year old asserted she was in Berlin to inform [[Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine|Princess Irene of Prussia]] (sister of [[Empress Alexandra]] and cousin of [[Czar Nicholas II]]) of her survival. Shortly after, Anderson was released from a [[Berlin]] area mental hospital, and was sent a series of questions from the son of Princess Irene, [[Prince Sigismund of Prussia#Namesake nephew|Sigismund]], that only the real Anastasia could possibly know. Oddly, Anderson answered every question correctly and gained reserved support from relatives of the [[Romanov]] family, while others influential to the case strongly opposed Anderson's claim. Finally, in 1925, after many forensic experts, Romanov family friends, tutors, and doctors made clear their conflicting opinions, Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna travelled in secrecy to interview the recently hospitalized Anderson personally.[[Image:Anastasia&Olga.JPG|left|thumb|200px|The Grand Duchess (left) and her niece, Anastasia]]After initial acceptance of Anderson as her niece, the Grand Duchess and Anastasia's former childhood [[tutor]], Pierre Gilliard, denounced her as a fraud. However, prior to the Grand Duchess' visit, many letters were exchanged between the two women and in some way Anderson somewhat convinced her self-proclaimed aunt that she was in fact, [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]]. The Grand Duchess even sent two gifts to Anderson at the [[Berlin]] hospital: a personal family album and a knitted shawl. Even though the Grand Duchess and many who personally knew Anastasia disbelieved Anderson's claims, others with close relationships to her heralded that Anderson was in absolute fact, Grand Duchess Anastasia, continually fueling the conspiracy of Anastasia's presumed [[assassination]] or possible escape.

==The End of Imperial Russia==
[[Image:romanov82.jpg|right|thumb|240px|The Last Grand Duchess, her later years in Canada]]

When the farm became a hassle for the aging [[Romanov]] and her husband, the family moved to [[Cooksville, Ontario]], [[Canada]], a small [[suburb]] of [[Toronto]]. Neighbors and visitors to the region took interest in the rumours of the Last [[Romanov]] living in [[Canada]], and visited her often. Foreign dignitaries and royal family members also frequently visited the Kulikovsky-Romanoffs in Cooksville. Such visitors included [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent]], the daughter of [[Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia]] who evacuated to [[Athens, Greece]] before the Revolution. Other notable guests included [[Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna of Russia]], His Highness Prince Vassily Alexandrovich, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma]], and his wife, [[Edwina Mountbatten, Countess Mountbatten of Burma]]. One of the more grander visitations occurred when [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]], [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], and [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] visited the Grand Duchess, her husband, and sons. The Queen later invited the Kulikovsky-Romanoff family to vacation aboard [[HMY Britannia]], the [[Royal Yacht]]. In 1951, former officers and members of the famed Akhtyrsky Regiment gathered at the home of the Grand Duchess to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Royal Regiment. Thereafter, she became the patroness of the Association of Russian Cadets of Toronto.

When her husband died in 1958, she moved to an apartment above a barbershop in Toronto where she died on [[November 24]], [[1960]], at the age of [[78]]. The Grand Duchess is interred next to her husband in [[York Cemetery, Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. The funeral for the last Grand Duchess of Russia was attended by numerous Russian immigrants to Canada who arranged a dignified guard of honor. ''[[The New York Times]]'' headlined in its obituaries section the passing of the Grand Duchess, but erroneously placed a photograph of [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia]]. The funeral ceremony was attended by large crowds; however, there were no [[Romanov]] family members in attendance.

==Legacy==
[[Image:romanovmemorial.jpg|left|thumb|180px|The Russian Orthodox monument to memorialize the last Grand Duchess of Imperial Russia in [[York Cemetery, Toronto]].]]

Long before the Grand Duchess died, her philanthropic tradition, which began at her estate in Olgino, sparked the birth of numerous humanitarian missions. Through agreements with her relatives, the monarchs of neighboring countries, she was able to provide support for thousands of Russian refugees fleeing the conflict of the Russian revolution, [[World War I]], and eventually [[World War II]]. Her level of benefaction surpassed the contributing attempts of her ancestors, but the tradition to contribute was passed to her descendants. The Russian Relief Program was founded in honor of the late Grand Duchess, organized by her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The Program has written agreements with many of Europe's monarchies to continue a high level of contribution to the poor of [[Russia]] and the outerlying [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS). The Grand Duchess, Olga Alexandrovna Romanov, was presumably the most notable and powerful of Russia's great benefactors, with a legacy of philanthropy that continues to this day.
