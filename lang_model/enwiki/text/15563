"'''Heart-Shaped Box'''" is a song by the American [[grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], written by vocalist and guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]]. The song was released as the first [[Single (music)|single]] from the group's third and final [[studio album]], ''[[In Utero]]'', in 1993. It was one of two songs from the album mixed by [[Scott Litt]] in order to augment the original production by producer [[Steve Albini]]. While Nirvana's label [[DGC Records]] did not release a physical single for sale in the United States, "Heart-Shaped Box" received much American radio airplay, reaching number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. The international release of the single reached number five in the United Kingdom.  The song's music video, directed by [[Anton Corbijn]], garnered critical plaudits.

==Origin and recording==
Kurt Cobain wrote "Heart-Shaped Box" in early 1992.<ref name="Gaar53">Gaar, p. 53</ref> Cobain forgot about the song for a while, but began working on it again when he and his wife [[Courtney Love]] moved to a house in the [[Hollywood Hills]].<ref>Azerrad, p. 324-25</ref> In a 1994 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, Love said she overheard him working on the song's riff in a closet. She said she asked him if she could use the riff for one of her songs, to which he replied, "Fuck off!" and closed the closet door. "He was trying to be so sneaky", said Love. "I could hear that one from downstairs."<ref>Fricke, David. "[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/courtneylove/articles/story/5937442/life_after_death Life After Death]. ''Rolling Stone''. December 15, 1994. Retrieved on December 7, 2008.</ref> The couple shared a journal in which they would write lyrics; Cobain biographer [[Charles R. Cross]] noted that Love's songwriting sensibility informed Cobain's on the song.<ref name="Cross, p. 278">Cross, p. 278</ref> The song's name came from a heart-shaped box Love had given Cobain. However, Cobain had originally titled the song "Heart-Shaped Coffin".<ref name="Cross, p. 278"/>

Nirvana had difficulty completing the song. Cobain attempted to have the rest of the band complete the song during jam sessions. He said, "During those practices, I was trying to wait for Krist and Dave to come up with something but it just turned into noise all the time." One day Cobain made one last attempt at completing the song. Cobain was able to come up with a vocal melody and the band finally finished writing the song. Cobain said that when they completed "Heart-Shaped Box", "We finally realized that it was a good song."<ref name="Azerrad, p. 325">Azerrad, p. 325</ref>

In January 1993, the band recorded a [[Demo (music)|demo]] of "Heart-Shaped Box" during sessions with Craig Montgomery in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]; it was the first song recorded.<ref>Gaar, p. 23-25</ref> The ''In Utero'' version was recorded in February 1993 by [[Steve Albini]] in [[Cannon Falls, Minnesota]]. It was [[remix]]ed, along with "[[All Apologies]]" and later "[[Pennyroyal Tea]]," by [[Scott Litt]] prior to the album's release. Cobain was unapologetic about the band's decision, and maintained that the vocals and bass were not prominent enough in the original mixes. Nirvana [[bassist]] [[Krist Novoselic]] was also unhappy with the original mix of "Heart-Shaped Box." In a 1993 ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' interview, he said the original [[effects pedal|effect]] used on the song's guitar solo sounded "like a fucking abortion hitting the floor." When the song was remixed by Scott Litt, Cobain took the opportunity to add acoustic guitar and backing harmonies.<ref>Azerrad, p. 338</ref>

Displeased with the sound of the song, Nirvana had Litt increase the volume of Cobain's vocals and the bass guitar, and the group added acoustic guitar and backing vocals.

Journalist Gillian Gaar described "Heart-Shaped Box" as "the Nirvana formula personified, with a restrained, descending riff played through the verse, building in intensity to the cascading passion of the chorus".<ref name="Gaar53" />

Cobain said the song was inspired by documentaries about children with cancer. He told biographer [[Michael Azerrad]], "Anytime I think about it, it makes me sadder than anything I can think of."<ref>Azerrad, p. 324</ref> Azerrad asserted in his biography of Nirvana, ''[[Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana]]'', that despite Cobain's explanation, the song actually appeared to be about Courtney Love.<ref name="Azerrad, p. 325"/> Charles Cross wrote in his biography of Cobain ''[[Heavier Than Heaven]]'' that with the lyric "I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black", Cobain "sang in what has to be the most convoluted route any songwriter undertook in pop history to say 'I love you'".<ref>Cross, p. 281</ref> Cobain said that the song's chorus of "Hey/Wait/I've got a new complaint" was him giving an example of how he was perceived by the media.<ref>Mothersole, Ben.

==Release==
In the United States, DGC issued "Heart-Shaped Box" to [[Campus radio|college]], [[modern rock]], and [[album-oriented rock]] radio stations in early September 1993. There were no plans to release a single for the song domestically. At the time, [[Geffen Records]]' head of marketing told ''Billboard'' that the label was not actively courting [[Top 40]] radio, explaining "Nirvana didn't sell nearly 5 million [records] because of a hit single. They sold that many albums because of who they are." The song entered the ''Billboard'' Modern Rock Tracks chart at number seven,<ref>Rosen, Craig. "Nirvana Set has Smell of Success". ''Billboard''. September 25, 1993.</ref> and eventually peaked at number one on the chart. The song also reached number four on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref name="billboard">"[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=5316&model.vnuAlbumId=810092 Nirvana<U+2014>Artist Chart History: Singles]". ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. Retrieved on September 11, 2007.</ref> A single of the song was released in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="Gaar98">Gaar, p. 98</ref>

==Music video==
Nirvana originally wanted [[Kevin Kerslake]], who had directed the videos for the band's singles "[[Come as You Are (Nirvana song)|Come as You Are]]", "[[Lithium (Nirvana song)|Lithium]]", "[[In Bloom]]", and "[[Sliver (song)|Sliver]]", to direct the "Heart-Shaped Box" music video. Kerslake prepared five treatments during July and August 1993, but no shoot arrangements were made and by the end of the month, the group decided to work with Dutch [[photographer]] and [[music video director|video director]] [[Anton Corbijn]].<ref>Gaar, p. 88</ref> Corbijn, who typically created his own ideas for videos, was initially unsure of directing the video since Cobain's treatment was so detailed. Corbijn said, "But then I looked at it and I thought that actually it was pretty good. I was very amazed by somebody writing a song and having those ideas as precise as he did."<ref>Gaar, p. 90-91</ref>

The video begins and ends with the band in a hospital setting watching an old man being administered medication through an IV drip. The majority of the video takes place in a surreal outdoor setting that incorporates imagery from the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.<ref name="Gaar, p. 90">Gaar, p. 90</ref> During the song's first verse, the old man from the hospital climbs onto a crow-ridden [[Christian cross]]. The second verse introduces a young girl in a [[Ku Klux Klan]] costume reaching for human [[fetus]]es in a tree, and an overweight woman in a suit with human organs painted onto it and with [[angel]] wings affixed to her back. In the video's final cut, the band is only shown performing in the outdoor setting during the choruses, where Cobain's face moves in and out of focus in the camera.<ref name="Gaar, p. 90"/> While most of the video was devised by Cobain, Corbijn added elements such as the intentionally artificial crows, a ladder for the old man to climb onto the cross with, and a box with a heart at the top that the band performs inside of during the song's final chorus.<ref>Gaar, p. 91</ref> Corbijn created another cut of the video featuring alternate footage during the final verse, including more shots of the young girl and the woman, and scenes of Cobain lying on his back in the poppy field, with mist surrounding him. This version of the video is featured on the DVD ''The Work of Director Anton Corbijn''.<ref>Gaar, p. 93</ref>

After the video's release, Kevin Kerslake sued Nirvana, alleging copyright infringement. The case was settled out of court.<ref>Gaar, p. 94</ref> The video won two [[MTV Video Music Awards]] in 1994, for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video|Best Alternative Video]] and for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]]. As the ceremony was held after Kurt Cobain's April 1994 death, the awards were accepted by Cobain's former bandmates Novoselic, Grohl, and touring guitarist [[Pat Smear]].<ref>Gaar, p. 95</ref> "Heart-Shaped Box" also topped the music video category in the 1993 ''[[Village Voice]]'' [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll.<ref name="PazzJop">Christgau, Robert.
