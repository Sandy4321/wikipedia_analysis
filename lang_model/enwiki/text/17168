{{nihongo|'''''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'''''|<U+30BD><U+30CB><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30FB><U+30B6><U+30FB><U+30D8><U+30C3><U+30B8><U+30DB><U+30C3><U+30B0>3|Sonikku za Hejjihoggu Sur<U+012B>}} is a [[platform game|platform]] [[video game]] developed by [[Sonic Team]] and published by [[Sega]] for the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]] as part of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series. It was released on February 2, 1994. The game is a direct sequel to ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (16-bit)|Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'', and follows the end of the game in which [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] and [[Tails (character)|Tails]] defeated their enemy, [[Doctor Eggman|Dr. Robotnik]]. After crash-landing on a floating island, Sonic and Tails encounter a new character named [[Knuckles the Echidna]], and must once more retrieve the Chaos Emeralds while also working to stop Dr. Robotnik from relaunching his ship, the Death Egg.

Development of the game began shortly after the release of its predecessor in 1992; it was originally intended to be a top-down, [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] game, similar to what would eventually become ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]''. However, this concept was abandoned early into development, after the team did not want to change the Sonic formula too radically for a sequel. The game is closely tied to its direct sequel ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]'', as the two titles were originally developed as a single game until time constraints and cartridge costs forced them to be split into two interlocking parts. Some re-releases have packaged the two together as ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles''.

As with its two predecessors, the game was both a critical and commercial success upon release, with critics seeing it as an improvement over previous installments. Despite its critical acclaim, the game only sold 1.02 million copies on the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive in comparison to both of its predecessors, with a combined 21 million sold. Since its 1994 release, the game has been re-released through several compilations and download releases for various platforms, including ''[[Sonic Mega Collection]]'' for the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]] and the ''[[Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection]]'' for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]].

==Plot==
<!-- Please don't add in Master Emerald, aside from cite note - Only the Sonic (3) & Knuckles story mentions it.-->
After Sonic defeats [[Dr. Robotnik]] at the end of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (16-bit)|Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'', his space station, the Death Egg, crash-lands on a mystical floating landmass called Angel Island. As Robotnik begins to repair the damaged station, he meets up with Knuckles the Echidna, the last surviving member of an ancient civilization of echidnas that once inhabited the island. He is also the guardian of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Master Emerald|Master Emerald]], which controls the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Chaos Emeralds|Chaos Emeralds]] and grants the island its levitation powers.

Knowing Sonic and Tails will try to track him down and realizing he can use the Master Emerald to power the ship, Robotnik dupes Knuckles into believing Sonic is trying to steal the Emerald. Shortly after, Sonic and Tails in their biplane, the Tornado, are in search of Dr. Robotnik. Sonic, possessing the emeralds from the events of ''Sonic 2'', then turns into [[Super Sonic]]. As soon as they arrive, Knuckles ambushes Sonic from underground and knocks the Chaos Emeralds from him, returning him to normal. Knuckles steals the Emeralds and disappears inland. As Sonic and Tails travel through the levels, they encounter Knuckles in almost every level, hindering their progress.

In the last level, Launch Base Zone, the Death Egg launches off for the second time, knocking Knuckles off a pole and sending him plummeting into the water. Sonic travels to a platform on the Death Egg, fights, and defeats Robotnik for the last time. The Death Egg is seen damaged and falling after Robotnik's defeat, after which it crashes back onto Angel Island - leading into the second half of the story in ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Sonic3 Hydrocity.png|thumb|200px|left|Sonic and Tails explore the underwater portion of Hydrocity, the second zone in ''Sonic 3''.]]
''Sonic 3'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]], [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]]. At the game's start, players can choose to select Sonic, Tails, or both. In the latter mode, players control Sonic while Tails runs along beside him; a second player can join in at any time and control Tails separately.<ref name="wii.ign.com"/> The game takes place over six [[level (video gaming)|levels]],<ref name="m1617">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 16<U+2013>17.</ref> each divided into two acts. Levels are populated with Robotnik's robots, called "badniks"; Sonic and Tails can defeat badniks by jumping on them or using the "spin dash" attack, which also gives the character a speed boost.<ref name="m89"/> The levels include obstacles and other features such as [[vertical loop]]s, corkscrews, breakable walls, spikes, water that the player can drown in, and bottomless pits.<ref name="game">{{cite video game|title=Sonic the Hedgehog 3|developer=Sonic Team|publisher=Sega|date=February 2, 1994}}</ref> ''Sonic 3'' adds the ability for Tails to fly<ref name="wii.ign.com"/> for a short time by spinning his twin tails like a propeller; when he gets too tired, he falls. Unlike Sonic, Tails can also swim underwater.<ref name="m89">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 8<U+2013>9.</ref> There is a [[miniboss]] fight with one of Robotnik's large, powerful robots at the end of the first act of each level and a full [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] fight with Robotnik at the end of the second.<ref name="m45">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 4<U+2013>5.</ref> Reaching a new level saves the player's game to one of six save slots, which can be loaded later.<ref name="m10">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 10.</ref>

The game uses [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Common features|rings]], scattered throughout the game's levels, as a health system; when the player is attacked without rings, is crushed, falls off-screen, or exceeds the act's ten-minute limit, they lose a [[health (gaming)|life]] and return to the most recently passed [[checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoint]]. Dying with zero lives gives the player a [[game over]]. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an [[1-up|extra life]], temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings,<ref name="m1213">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 12<U+2013>13.</ref> a shield that allows them to breathe underwater, a shield that allows them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield that attracts nearby rings.<ref name="palgn"/>

The game contains two types of "special stages". When the player collects at least 50 rings and passes a checkpoint, they can warp to the first type,<ref name=hidden>{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Jared|title=A Guide to 'Sonic The Hedgehog' Version 2.0's Hidden Level-select, Debug Mode, and Many More Secrets|url=http://toucharcade.com/2013/05/27/a-guide-to-sonic-the-hedgehog-version-2-0s-hidden-level-select-debug-mode-and-many-more-secrets/|publisher=Touch Arcade|accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref> which involves bouncing up a [[gumball machine]]-like corridor to earn power-ups by hitting a switch. Both sides of the corridor are lined with flippers, which disappear when the character bounces on them, and the switch drops when both flippers supporting it are removed. The corridor's floor contains a bounce pad, which also disappears after one use; falling afterwards causes the player to leave the stage with the most recent power-up collected.<ref name="m1415">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 14<U+2013>15.</ref>

The second type, triggered by entering giant rings found in secret passages, involves running around a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] map and passing through all of a number of blue spheres arranged in patterns. Passing through a blue sphere turns it red, and touching a red sphere causes the player to leave the stage, unless the player has just completed a cycle around an arrangement of blue spheres, in which case all of these spheres turn to harmless rings. Removing all of the blue spheres gives the player a [[Chaos Emerald]]; if Sonic (not Tails) collects all seven, he can become [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Common features|Super Sonic]] at will, which makes him invincible to most obstacles.<ref name="palgn"/><ref name="super">{{cite web|last1=Khan|first1=Jahanzeb|title=20 Years Ago: Sonic 3 & Knuckles|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/04/11/20-years-ago-sonic-knuckles/80530/|website=Hardcoregamer|publisher=HardcoreGamer LLC|accessdate=4 January 2015|date=April 2014}}</ref>

''Sonic 3'' includes a competitive mode: two players, controlling Sonic, Tails, or [[Knuckles the Echidna]] (this is the only way to use Knuckles without attaching ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]'' to the cartridge), race through one or all of five stages that do not appear in the main game. In these same stages, a single player can compete against the clock in [[time attack]]s.<ref name="m1819">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 18<U+2013>19.</ref>

===Connection to ''Sonic & Knuckles''===
{{main|Sonic & Knuckles}}

If the player owns a copy of ''Sonic & Knuckles'', they can attach it to their ''Sonic 3'' cartridge in order to play through both games end-to-end as "''Sonic 3 & Knuckles''". This allows for scenarios that are not possible in the individual games, such as playing ''Sonic 3'' levels as Knuckles or ''Sonic & Knuckles'' levels as Tails or the combination of Sonic and Tails.<ref name=addon>{{cite web|last1=Reed|first1=Chris|title=Video Shows <U+2018>Sonic 3 & Knuckles<U+2019> Proof of Concept|url=http://www.slidetoplay.com/news/video-shows-sonic-3-knuckles-proof-of-concept/|website=sidetoplay|publisher=Side to Play Inc|accessdate=19 January 2015}}{{verify credibility|date=January 2015}}</ref> The two games were intended for release as a single title, but ended up being separate games due to time and financial constraints.<ref name="wii.ign.com"/> Other new features are the ability to collect Super Emeralds, which can unlock new "Hyper" forms for all three characters, and improved save options, which record the number of lives and continues a player has. Lock-on functionality is also available in certain digital releases of the game, such as the [[Virtual Console]] service for the [[Wii]], if the player owns both games on the same platform.<ref name=hidden/> This also allows for an additional ending that shows Sonic returning the Master Emerald to Angel Island.<ref name="life">{{cite web|last1=Newton|first1=James|title=Sonic 3 & Knuckles lock-on|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/sonic_and_knuckles|website=NintendoLife|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref>

==Development==
===Pre-release===
[[Yuji Naka]] and [[Hirokazu Yasuhara]] were mainly responsible for the ''Sonic 3'' [[software design document|design document]] and project schedule.<ref>[http://sost.emulationzone.org/sonic_3/interview/rogerhector.htm Emulationzone's interview] - ''"Once Naka & Yasuhara agreed on a general design approach, they drew up a schedule and started working"''</ref> ''Sonic 3'' originally began as a top-down, [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric game]], similar to what would eventually become ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]''. This concept was abandoned early into development, after the team did not want to change the ''Sonic'' formula too radically for a sequel.<ref>[http://www.giantbomb.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3/61-4628/ Giant Bomb's overview] {{verify credibility|date=January 2015}}</ref>

''Sonic 3'' and ''Sonic & Knuckles'' were originally planned as one single-cartridge game. However, as time constraints and the manufacturing costs of a 34 megabit cartridge<ref>Sonic & Knuckles UK Manual, Page 4</ref> with NVRAM would have been prohibitively expensive, the decision was made to split the game in half, giving Yuji Naka and the other developers more time to finish the second part, and splitting the high cost between two cartridges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xbox.gamespy.com/articles/654/654750p4.html|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|title=Sega's Yuji Naka Talks!|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}</ref> The cartridge has a small amount of [[non-volatile random access memory|non-volatile RAM]] built into it, which allows the player to save game progress to the game cartridge.<ref name="gspot s3"/>

===Release===
''Sonic 3'' was released in the US on February 2, 1994, dubbed "Hedgehog Day", a reference to [[Groundhog Day]]. [[Toys "R" Us]] rewarded pre-orders with the limited edition CD [[Sonic the Hedgehog Boom|Sonic Boom]], containing music from and inspired by ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog CD|Sonic CD]]'' and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog Spinball|Sonic Spinball]]''.<ref>[http://www.gametrax.net/albums/990989/index.html Sonic Boom CD Information]</ref>

In Europe, ''Sonic 3'' was released on February 24, 1994. To help promote the game, [[Right Said Fred]] adapted the song [[Wonderman (Right Said Fred song)|Wonderman]], including references to many aspects of Sonic.<ref>[http://sost.emulationzone.org/sonic_3/scans/index.htm CD Cover and information scans]</ref> The song was used both in the game adverts, and released as a single, which charted in the UK at number 55.<ref>{{cite web|title=1991 charts|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/right%20said%20fred/|publisher=Official Charts Company|accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> In the music video, Fez and Skull from the Pirate TV Sega advertising campaign appeared along with Sonic.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grischow|first1=Chris|title=Lollapalooza 2011|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/08/09/lollapalooza-2011|publisher=IGN|accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref>

=== Michael Jackson's involvement ===
{{see also|Michael Jackson-related games}}
In a 2005 interview, [[Sonic Team#Sega Technical Institute|STI]] director Roger Hector stated that [[Michael Jackson]] was brought in to compose music for ''Sonic 3'', but after [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|scandals]] involving Jackson arose around this time, his involvement was terminated and the music reworked to hide said involvement.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[GameSetWatch]]|title=Michael Jackson's Secret Sonic 3 Shame |date=2006-03-27 |author=Carless, Simon |accessdate=June 27, 2009}}</ref> However, various interviews with more senior Sega staff have made it clear that any involvement of Jackson was arranged without the knowledge of Sega's executives or marketing staff, and no contracts or formal agreements were ever made.<ref name="sega-16.com">{{cite web | url=http://www.sega-16.com/2009/05/sega-legends-michael-jackson-sonic-3/ | title=Sega Legends: Michael Jackson & Sonic 3 | last=Horowitz | first=Ken | publisher=Sega-16|date=May 19, 2009 |accessdate=December 17, 2009}}</ref> 

James Hansen of Sonic Stuff Research Group states that Cirocco Jones (credited as "Scirocco" in ''Sonic 3'') possesses some demos of Jackson's contributions. "I actually have 'ALL' of the tracks...," Jones wrote, "from the original humming of Michael calling in the middle of the night leaving messages, to his ideas at Record One with Matt Forger and [[Bruce Swedien]]. - BUT, I don't think I can let any of that out to the public without permission."<ref name="sega-16.com"/> Jones is credited alongside Jackson and Jackson's tour keyboardist and songwriting collaborator [[Brad Buxer]] on his website, which mentions their roles in contributing musical cues for "levels 2 & 3" of "Sonic the Hedgehog".<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Cirocco|title=Cirocco Jones discography|url=http://www.musicpowers.com/id31.html|publisher=MusicPowers.com|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>

In a 2009 interview with French magazine ''Black & White'', Buxer stated that Jackson was indeed involved with some of ''Sonic 3''{{'}}s compositions, but chose to remain uncredited because he was unhappy with the sound reproduction capabilities of the Genesis. Buxer also said that the ending music of ''Sonic 3'' later became the basis for Jackson's single "[[Stranger in Moscow]]".<ref name="Montgomery, James">{{cite web |publisher=MTV.com |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1627664/20091204/jackson_michael.jhtml |title=Did Michael Jackson Compose 'Sonic The Hedgehog 3' Soundtrack? |date=2009-12-04 |author=Montgomery, James |accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref> It has also been noted that Ice Cap Zone's theme shares the same chord progression as "Hard Times", a previously unreleased track by [[The Jetzons]], of which Buxer was the keyboardist and co-songwriter.<ref>http://www.tssznews.com/2013/11/11/origins-of-sonic-3s-ice-cap-music-uncovered/ {{verify credibility|date=January 2015}}</ref>

In October 2013, [[GameTrailers]] dedicated an episode of its ''Pop Fiction'' mini-series to discerning Jackson's involvement. Roger Hector, who previously stated that Jackson's involvement in the game was dropped due to scandals surrounding the artists coming to light, reaffirmed his stance, stating any similarities to Jackson's music in the final game was not intentional on Sega's part.<ref>{{cite web|title=Episode 39: Sonic 3: Michael Jackson|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/full-episodes/zo88qk/pop-fiction-episode-39--sonic-3--michael-jackson|website=GameTrailers|publisher=DEFY Media|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> Whilst GameTrailers were unable to interview Buxer to confirm his stance and were about to close their investigation, they were able to find and speak to an anonymous source who was directly involved with the game's development. They echoed Buxer's statements that Jackson left the project due to his displeasure with the sound quality and that tracks that he had worked on before he left the project, which the source claimed was actually ''before'' the scandals concerning him were made public, remained in the game unaltered, with Jackson choosing to remain uncredited. Carnival Night Zone was specifically mentioned as one of the tracks he composed.<ref>http://www.gametrailers.com/full-episodes/zo88qk/pop-fiction-episode-39--sonic-3--michael-jackson</ref>

Similarly to its predecessors, ''Sonic 3'' received strongly positive reviews upon release, with a score of 89% at review aggregator [[GameRankings]].<ref name="gr_s3"/> Reviews of later ports have been slightly less positive; its Xbox 360 release has scores of 78.33% and 79% at GameRankings and [[Metacritic]], respectively.<ref name="gr x360"/><ref name="mc x360"/> Some critics, such as Adam Ghiggino of [[PALGN]], felt the game had been insufficiently upgraded for its re-releases;<ref name="palgn"/> Dan Whitehead of [[Eurogamer]] wished online co-op had been implemented.<ref name="euro"/> Frank Provo of [[GameSpot]] and Lucas M. Thomas of [[IGN]] wished Sega had re-released the game and its successor together as ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles'' instead.<ref name="gspot_s3"/><ref name="wii.ign.com"/>

Critics generally felt ''Sonic 3'' was the best game in the series so far. Andrew Humphreys of ''[[Hyper (magazine)|Hyper]]'', who declared himself not a ''Sonic'' fan, said it was "undoubtedly" the best of the series, including the acclaimed but obscure ''Sonic CD'', though he admitted having preferred ''Sonic 2''{{'}}s special stages by a small margin.<ref name="hyper"/> ''[[Sega Magazine]]'', however, stated that ''Sonic 3'' has better special stages and is not only superior to ''Sonic 2'' as a whole but would be "a serious contender for the Best Platform Game Ever award".<ref name="sm"/> ''[[Sega Power]]'' wrote that despite their skepticism, they found it "excellent" and easily "the most explorable and playable" in the series.<ref name="power"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' also compared ''Sonic 3'' favorably to ''Sonic 1'', ''2'', and ''CD'' and awarded it their "Game of the Month" award.<ref name="EGM30"/> Thomas stated that ''Sonic 3'' "completed the trilogy as the best of them all."<ref name="wii.ign.com"/> Whitehead, however, considered ''Sonic & Knuckles'' superior.<ref name="euro"/>

However, some critics also felt it had innovated too little from previous ''Sonic'' games. Humphreys saw only "a few new features"<ref name="hyper"/> while ''Sega Power'' thought it was "not all that different"<ref name="power"/> and NintendoLife writer Damien McFerran said that "there's not a lot of new elements here to be brutally frank".<ref name="nlife"/> Provo stated that the game's most significant addition was its save system.<ref name="gspot_s3"/> However, he and ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' also both enjoyed its new power-ups.<ref name="gspot_s3"/><ref name="EGM30"/> Many aspects of the game's level design were praised. ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' and ''Sega Power'' enjoyed the game's expansive stages, secret areas, much less linear level design, and difficulty.<ref name="EGM30"/><ref name="power"/> ''[[Mean Machines]]'' agreed, describing the game as "a rollercoater ride from start to finish" and listing Carnival Night as their favorite level, which they described as "probably the most slickly programmed portion of game in Megadrive history".<ref name="mean"/> Humphreys and ''Mean Machines'' felt that the game was too short, but they and ''Sega Magazine'' felt that its two-player mode and the Emerald collecting would significantly extend the title's [[replay value]].<ref name="hyper"/><ref name="mean"/><ref name="sm"/> On the other hand, Whitehead said that the stages' large sizes would keep players sufficiently engrossed.<ref name="euro"/> ''Sega Magazine'' also enjoyed having the ability to play as Knuckles in the two-player mode.<ref name="sm"/>

The visuals were very well received. Humphreys described ''Sonic 3'' as "one of the most beautiful games around" and full of "flashy new visual tricks", highlighting Sonic's ascension up pipes and spiraling pathways as particularly inventive.<ref name="hyper"/> ''Sega Magazine'' exclaimed that its graphics were "brilliant" even for a ''Sonic'' title,<ref name="sm"/> while Provo praised the "elaborate" backgrounds.<ref name="gspot_s3"/> ''Mean Machines'' thought similarly, giving special praise to the camera's quick scrolling, the diversity of the level themes, and the "chunkier, more detailed" overall aesthetic.<ref name="mean"/> Thomas and Provo especially enjoyed the use of wordless cutscenes to effect a coherent story and thematically connect the zones.<ref name="wii.ign.com"/><ref name="gspot_s3"/> McFerran, however, felt that the visuals had been downgraded, particularly Sonic's "dumpier" sprite and "the infamous 'dotty' textures".<ref name="nlife"/>

The sound effects and music were also well received, though somewhat less so. ''Sega Magazine'' described them as "brilliant" and "far superior" to ''Sonic 2''{{'}}s.<ref name="sm"/> ''Mean Machines'' stated that every level had "great tunes" and sound effects and particularly praised the game's ending music.<ref name="mean"/> However, Humphreys described the sound as "Sonicky ... with the emphasis on the 'icky'"; he also found it strikingly similar to the first two ''Sonic'' games' soundtracks.<ref name="hyper"/> Thomas thought the music was "impressive", but not quite on par with ''Sonic 2''{{'}}s.<ref name="wii.ign.com"/>

The game has sold 1.02 million copies on the Sega Genesis as of December 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-magicbox.com/Chart-USPlatinum.shtml|title=US Platinum Videogame Chart|accessdate=December 31, 2014|publisher=The Magic Box}}</ref> While ''Sonic 1''{{'}}s sales have been estimated at 15 million<!-- 1:21 --><ref>{{cite video|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mFs2v7XM4o|title=Sonic the Hedgehog GameTap Retrospective Pt. 3/4|medium=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[GameTap]] (user gametap)|date=February 16, 2009|accessdate=February 6, 2014}}</ref> and ''Sonic 2''{{'}}s at 6 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamasutra.com/features/20060804/boutros_05.shtml|title=A Detailed Cross-Examination of Yesterday and Today's Best-Selling Platform Games |pages=5|accessdate=December 8, 2006|date=August 4, 2006|first=Daniel|last=Boutros|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]}}</ref> ''Sonic 3'', unlike these two, was not bundled with the Genesis console itself. However, ''Sonic 3'' is still classifiable as one of the [[List of best-selling video games#Sega Genesis.2FMega Drive|best-selling Genesis games of all time]]. ''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' ranked it the fifth best Genesis game ever in November 1994.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Mega|issue=26|page=74|publisher=[[Maverick Magazines]]|date=November 1994}}</ref> In 2014, [[GamesRadar]] ranked ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles'' as the seventh best Genesis game;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/best-sega-genesis-games-all-time/|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|title=Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time|author=GamesRadar Staff|date=August 14, 2014|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref> Jeremy Parish of ''[[US Gamer]]'' ranked the combined title eighth on a similar list in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-best-genesis-and-sega-cd-games|publisher=''[[US Gamer]]''|title=The 10 Best Genesis/Mega Drive and Top 5 Sega CD Games|last=Parish|first=Jeremy|date=October 29, 2013|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref>
