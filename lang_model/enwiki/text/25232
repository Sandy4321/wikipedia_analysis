{{nihongo|'''''Jidaigeki'''''|[[wikt:<U+6642><U+4EE3><U+5287>|<U+6642><U+4EE3><U+5287>]]}} is a [[genre]] of [[film]], [[television]], and [[theatre]] in [[Japan]]. Literally "period dramas", they are most often set during the [[Edo period]] of [[History of Japan|Japanese history]], from 1603 to 1868.  Some, however, are set much earlier<U+2014>''[[Portrait of Hell]]'', for example, is set during the late [[Heian period]]<U+2014>and the early [[Meiji era]] is also a popular setting. ''Jidaigeki'' show the lives of the [[samurai]], farmers, craftsmen, and merchants of their time. ''Jidaigeki'' films are sometimes referred to as [[chambara]] movies, a word meaning "sword fight", though chambara is more accurately a sub-genre of ''jidageki''. ''Jidaigeki'' rely on an established set of [[dramatic conventions]] including the use of makeup, language, catchphrases, and plotlines.

==Types of ''jidaigeki''==

Many ''jidaigeki'' take place in [[Edo]], the military capital. Others show the adventures of people wandering from place to place. The long-running television series ''[[Zenigata Heiji]]'' and ''[[Abarenb<U+014D> Sh<U+014D>gun]]'' typify the Edo ''jidaigeki''. ''[[Mito K<U+014D>mon]]'', the fictitious story of the travels of the historical [[daimyo]] [[Tokugawa Mitsukuni]], and the ''[[Zatoichi]]'' movies and television series, exemplify the traveling style. 

Another way to categorize ''jidaigeki'' is according to the social status of the principal characters. The title character of ''Abarenb<U+014D> Shogun'' is [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]], the eighth [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] [[shogun]]. The head of the samurai class, Yoshimune assumes the disguise of a low-ranking [[hatamoto]], a samurai in the service of the shogun. Similarly, Mito K<U+014D>mon is the retired vice-shogun, masquerading as a merchant. In contrast, the coin-throwing Heiji of ''Zenigata Heiji'' is a [[commoner]], working for the police, while Ichi (the title character of ''[[Zatoichi]]''), a blind masseur, is an outcast, as were many disabled people in that era. In fact, masseurs, who typically were at the bottom of the professional food chain, was one of the few vocational positions available to the blind in that era. ''Gokenin Zankur<U+014D>'' is a samurai but, due to his low rank and income, he has to work extra jobs that higher-ranking samurai were unaccustomed to doing.

Whether the lead role is samurai or commoner, ''jidaigeki'' usually reach a climax in an immense sword fight just before the end. The title character of a series always wins, whether using a sword or a ''[[jutte]]'' (the device police used to trap, and sometimes to bend or break, an opponent's sword).

===Sengoku-jidai===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
'''Sengoku-jidai''' ([[Sengoku period|Warring States]] era setting) is a [[Japan]]ese [[genre]] that has been used as the setting for [[novel]]s, [[film]]s, [[video game]]s, and even [[anime]] and [[manga]]. It bears some parallels with the [[Western (genre)|Western]]; [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', for example, was remade in a Western setting as ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''. The anime and manga series ''[[InuYasha]]'' is set in this period despite some moments that were set in the modern era.

==Roles in ''jidaigeki''==
Among the characters in ''jidaigeki'' are a parade of people with occupations unfamiliar to modern [[Japanese people|Japanese]], and especially to foreigners. Here are a few.

===Warriors===
{{Main|Samurai cinema}}
The warrior class included samurai, hereditary members in the military service of a daimyo or the shogun (themselves samurai). [[Ronin]], samurai without masters, were also warriors, and like samurai, wore two swords; they were, however, without inherited employment or status. ''Bugeisha'' were men, or in some stories women, who aimed to perfect their martial arts, often by traveling throughout the country. ''[[Ninja]]'' were the secret service, specializing in stealth, the use of disguises, explosives, and concealed weapons.

===Craftsmen===
Craftsmen in ''jidaigeki'' included metalworkers (often abducted to mint counterfeit coins), bucket-makers, carpenters and plasterers, and makers of woodblock prints for art or newspapers.

===Merchants===
In addition to the owners of businesses large and small, the ''jidaigeki'' often portray the employees. The ''bant<U+014D>'' was a high-ranking employee of a merchant, the ''tedai'', a lower helper. Many merchants employed children, or ''koz<U+014D>''. Itinerant merchants included the organized medicine-sellers, vegetable-growers from outside the city, and peddlers at fairs outside temples and shrines. In contrast, the great brokers in rice, lumber and other commodities operated sprawling shops in the city.

===Governments===
In the highest ranks of the shogunate were the ''roj<U+016B>''. Below them were the ''wakadoshiyori'', then the various ''bugy<U+014D>'' or administrators, including the ''jisha bugy<U+014D>'' (who administered temples and shrines), the ''kanj<U+014D> bugy<U+014D>'' (in charge of finances) and the two ''Edo machi bugy<U+014D>''. These last alternated by month as chief administrator of the city. Their role encompassed mayor, chief of police, and judge, and jury in criminal and civil matters. 

[[Image:Banya, Jidaigeki set 2002.jpg|thumb|250px|Ban'ya, Toei Uzumasa Studios]]
The machi bugy<U+014D> oversaw the police and fire departments. The police, or ''machikata'', included the high-ranking ''yoriki'' and the ''d<U+014D>shin'' below them; both were samurai. In ''jidaigeki,'' they often have full-time patrolmen, ''okappiki'' and ''shitappiki'', who were commoners. (Historically, these people were irregulars, called to service only when necessary.) Zenigata Heiji is an ''okappiki''. The police lived in barracks at Hatch<U+014D>bori in Edo. They manned ''ban'ya'', the watch-houses, throughout the metropolis. The ''jitte'' was the symbol of the police, from yoriki to shitappiki. 

A separate police force handled matters involving samurai. The ''<U+014D>metsuke'' were high-ranking officials in the shogunate; the ''metsuke'' and ''kachi-metsuke'', lower-ranking police who could detain samurai. Yet another police force investigated arson-robberies, while [[Jinja (Shinto)|Shinto shrines]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist temples]] fell under the control of another authority. The feudal nature of Japan made these matters delicate, and jurisdictional disputes are common in ''jidaigeki.''

Edo had three fire departments. The ''daimyo-bikeshi'' were in the service of designated daimyo; the ''j<U+014D>bikeshi'' reported to the shogunate; while the ''machi-bikeshi'', beginning under Yoshimune, were commoners under the administration of the ''machibugy<U+014D>.'' Thus, even the fire companies have turf wars in the ''jidaigeki''.

[[Image:Jidaigeki dummy Yoshiwara.jpg|thumb|250px|Licensed quarter on a set at Toei Uzumasa Studios, Kyoto]]
Each daimyo maintained a residence in Edo, where he lived during ''[[sankin kotai]].'' His wife and children remained there even while he was away from Edo, and the ladies-in-waiting often feature prominently in ''jidaigeki.'' A high-ranking samurai, the ''Edo-gar<U+014D>'', oversaw the affairs in the daimyo's absence. In addition to a staff of samurai, the household included ''[[ashigaru]]'' (lightly armed warrior-servants) and ''ch<U+016B>gen'' and ''yakko'' (servants often portrayed as flamboyant and crooked). Many daimyo employed doctors, ''goten'i''; their counterpart in the shogun's household was the ''okuishi''. Count on them to provide the poisons that kill and the potions that heal.

===Other===
The cast of a wandering ''jidaigeki'' encountered a similar setting in each ''[[Han (country subdivision)|han]].'' There, the ''kar<U+014D>'' were the ''kuni-gar<U+014D>'' and the ''j<U+014D>dai-gar<U+014D>''. Tensions between them have provided plots for many stories.

==Conventions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2006}}

There are several dramatic conventions of ''jidaigeki'':

*The heroes often wear eye makeup, and the villains often have disarranged hair.
*A contrived form of old-fashioned Japanese speech, using modern pronunciation and grammar with a high degree of formality and frequent archaisms.
*In long-running TV series, like ''Mito K<U+014D>mon'' and ''Zenigata Heiji'', the lead and supporting actors sometimes change. This is done without any rationale for the change of appearance. The new actor simply appears in the place of the old one and the stories continue. This is similar to the [[James Bond film series]].
*In a swordfight, when a large number of villains attacks the main character, they never attack at once. The main character first launches into a lengthy preamble detailing the crimes the villains have committed, at the end of which the villains then initiate hostilities. The villains charge singly or in pairs; the rest wait their turn to be dispatched and surround the main character until it is their turn to be easily defeated. Swordfights are the grand finale of the show and are conducted to specially crafted theme music for their duration.
*On television, even fatal sword cuts draw little blood, and often do not even cut through clothing. Villains are chopped down with deadly, yet completely invisible, sword blows. Despite this, blood or wounding may be shown for arrow wounds or knife cuts.
*In [[chambara]] films, the violence is generally considerably stylized, sometimes to such a degree that sword cuts cause geysers of blood from wounds. Dismemberment and decapitation are common.

===Proverbs and catchphrases===
Authors of ''jidaigeki'' work pithy sayings into the dialog. Here are a few:

* ''Tonde hi ni iru natsu no mushi'': Like bugs that fly into the fire in the summer (they will come to their destruction)

* ''Shishi shinch<U+016B> no mushi'': A wolf in sheep's clothing (literally, a parasite in the lion's body)

* ''Kaji to kenka wa Edo no hana'': Fires and brawls are the flower of Edo

* ''<U+014C>edo happyaku yach<U+014D>'': "The eight hundred neighborhoods of Edo"

* ''Tabi wa michizure'': "Travel is who you take with you"

In addition, the authors of series invent their own catchphrases called ''kimarizerifu'' that the protagonist says at the same point in nearly every episode. In ''Mito K<U+014D>mon'', in which the eponymous character disguises himself as a commoner, in the final swordfight, a sidekick invariably holds up an accessory bearing the shogunal crest and shouts, ''Hikae! Kono mondokoro ga me ni hairanu ka?'': "Back! Can you not see this emblem?", revealing the identity of the hitherto unsuspected old man with a goatee beard. The villains then instantly surrender and beg forgiveness. Likewise, [[T<U+014D>yama no Kin-san]] bares his tattooed shoulder and snarls, ''Kono sakurafubuki o miwasureta to iwasane zo!'': "I won't let you say you forgot this cherry-blossom blizzard!" After sentencing the criminals, he proclaims, ''Kore nite ikken rakuchaku'': "Case closed." 

The ''kimarizerifu'' betrays the close connection between the ''jidaigeki'' and the comic-book [[superhero]].{{Citation needed|reason=Septober 2008|date=October 2008}}

==Influence==
''[[Star Wars]]'' creator [[George Lucas]] has admitted to being inspired significantly by the period works of [[Akira Kurosawa]], and many thematic elements found in ''Star Wars'' bear the influence of [[Chanbara]] filmmaking. In an interview, Lucas has specifically cited the fact that he became acquainted with the term ''jidaigeki'' while in Japan, and it is widely assumed that he took inspiration for the term [[Jedi]] from this.<ref name="sanctuary">{{cite web|url=http://www.jedisanctuary.org/history.php|title=History of the Jedi & The Jedi Religion|publisher=Jedi Sanctuary|author=Jedi M.
