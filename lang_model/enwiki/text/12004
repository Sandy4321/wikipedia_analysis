Mauna Loa is the largest subaerial volcano in both mass and volume, and has historically been considered the largest volcano on [[Earth]]. It is an [[Volcano#Active|active]] [[shield volcano]], with a volume estimated at approximately {{convert|18000|mi3|km3}},<ref>{{cite conference|last=Kaye|first=G.D.|title=Using GIS to estimate the total volume of Mauna Loa Volcano, Hawaii|url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2002CD/finalprogram/abstract_34712.htm|booktitle=98th Annual Meeting|conference=Geological Society of America|year=2002}}</ref> although its peak is about {{convert|120|ft|m|0}} lower than that of its neighbor, [[Mauna Kea]].

Mauna Loa has probably been erupting for at least 700,000&nbsp;years, and may have emerged above sea level about 400,000&nbsp;years ago. The oldest-known dated rocks are not older than 200,000&nbsp;years.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/maunaloa/ | title = Mauna Loa: Earth's Largest Volcano | date = February 2, 2006 | accessdate = 2007-07-28| publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]] }}</ref> The volcano's [[magma]] comes from the [[Hawaii hotspot]], which has been responsible for the creation of the [[Hawaiian islands|Hawaiian island chain]] over tens of millions of years. The slow [[Plate tectonics#Continental drift|drift]] of the [[Pacific Plate]] will eventually carry Mauna Loa away from the hotspot within 500,000 to one million years from now, at which point it will become extinct.

Mauna Loa's most recent eruption occurred from March&nbsp;24 to April&nbsp;15, 1984. No recent eruptions of the volcano have caused fatalities, but eruptions in 1926 and 1950 destroyed villages, and the city of [[Hilo]] is partly built on lava flows from the late 19th century. Based on the hazards it poses to population centers, Mauna Loa is part of the [[Decade Volcanoes]] program, which encourages studies of the world's most dangerous volcanoes. Mauna Loa has been monitored intensively by the [[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]] since 1912. Observations of the [[atmosphere]] are undertaken at the [[Mauna Loa Observatory]], and of the [[Sun]] at the [[Mauna Loa Solar Observatory]], both located near the mountain's summit. [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park]] covers the summit and the southeastern flank of the volcano, and also incorporates [[K<U+012B>lauea]], a separate volcano.

Mauna Loa is a typical [[shield volcano]] in form, taking the shape of a long, broad dome extending down to the ocean floor whose slopes are about 12<U+00B0> at their steepest, a consequence of its extremely [[fluid]] lava. The shield-stage lavas that built the enormous main mass of the mountain are [[tholeiitic basalt]]s, like those of [[Mauna Kea]], created through the mixing of primary [[magma]] and [[subduction|subducted]] oceanic crust.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Claude Herzberg| title = Petrology and thermal structure of the Hawaiian plume from Mauna Kea volcano| url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7119/abs/nature05254.html| journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| publisher = [[Nature Publishing Group]]| volume = 444| issue = 7119| pages = 605<U+2013>9| date = 30 November 2006| pmid = 17136091| doi = 10.1038/nature05254 |bibcode = 2006Natur.444..605H |accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref> Mauna Loa's summit hosts three overlapping [[pit crater]]s arranged northeast-southwest, the first and last roughly {{convert|1|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} in diameter and the second an oblong {{convert|4.2|x|2.5|km|1|abbr=on}} feature; together these three craters make up the {{convert|6.2|by|2.5|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} summit caldera Moku{{okina}}<U+0101>weoweo,<ref name=hvo-caldera>{{cite web|title=When did Moku'aweoweo (the summit caldera of Mauna Loa) form?|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]<U+2014>[[United States Geological Survey]]|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/archive/2001/01_03_22.html|accessdate=11 December 2012|date=28 March 2001}}</ref> so named for the Hawaiian <U+02BB><U+0101>weoweo fish (''[[Priacanthus meeki]]''), purportedly due to the resemblance of its eruptive fires to the coloration of the fish.<ref>{{cite web|title=Place Names of Hawaii - Moku-<U+02BB><U+0101>weoweo|url=http://www.wehewehe.org/gsdl2.5/cgi-bin/hdict?a=q&r=1&hs=1&e=q-0hdict--00-0-0--010---4----den--0-000lpm--1haw-Zz-1---Zz-1-home---00031-0000escapewin-00&q=mokuaweoweo&j=pp&hdid=0&hdds=0|publisher=Ulukau - Hawaiian Electronic Library|accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref> Moku{{okina}}<U+0101>weoweo's caldera floor lies between {{convert|170|and|50|m|0|abbr=on}} beneath its rim and it is only the latest of several calderas that have formed and reformed over the volcano's life.

Mauna Loa's summit is also the focal point for its two prominent [[rift zone]]s, marked on the surface by well-preserved, relatively recent lava flows (easily seen in satellite imagery) and linearly arranged [[Fracture (geology)|fracture lines]] intersected by [[cinder cone|cinder]] and [[splatter cone]]s.<ref name=ajs-1980/> These rift zones are deeply set structures, driven by [[dike (geology)|dike]] intrusions along a [[d<U+00E9>collement|decollement fault]] that is believed to reach down all the way to the volcano's base, {{convert|12|to|14|km|0|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name=science-stress /> The first is a {{convert|60|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} rift trending southwest from the caldera to the sea and a further {{convert|40|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} underwater, with a prominent 40<U+00B0> directional change along its length; this rift zone is historically active across most of its length. The second, northeastern rift zone extends towards [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]] and is historically active across only the first {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of its length, with a nearly straight and, in its latter sections, poorly defined trend.<ref name=ajs-1980>{{cite journal|title=The Southwestern Rift Zone of Mauna Kea: Implications for Structural Evolution of Hawaiian Volcanoes|journal=[[American Journal of Science]]|year=1980|volume=280-A|pages=752<U+2013>776|author=Peter W.

There is also a less definite northward rift zone that extends towards the Humuula Saddle marking the intersection of Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea.<ref name=nps-loa />

Simplified geophysical models of Mauna Loa's [[magma chamber]] have been constructed, using [[interferometric synthetic aperture radar]] measures of [[Deformation (engineering)|ground deformation]] due to the slow buildup of lava under the volcano's surface. These models predict a {{convert|1.1|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide magma chamber located at a depth of about {{convert|4.7|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} below [[sea level]], near the southeastern margin of Moku{{okina}}<U+0101>weoweo. This shallow magma chamber is significantly higher-placed than Mauna Loa's rift zones, suggesting magma [[intrusion]] into the deeper and occasional dike injections into the shallower parts of the rift zone drive rift activity; a similar mechanism has been proposed for neighboring [[K<U+012B>lauea]].<ref name=science-stress /> Earlier models based on Mauna Loa's two most recent eruptions made a similar prediction, placing the chamber at {{convert|3|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} deep in roughly the same geographic position.<ref>{{cite web|title=What's up with Mauna Loa?|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/archive/2001/01_10_18.html|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]] - [[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=16 December 2012|date=23 October 2001}}</ref>

Because K<U+012B>lauea lacks a [[topographical prominence]] and appears as a bulge on the southeastern flank of Mauna Loa, it was historically interpreted by both native Hawaiians and early geologists to be an active satellite of Mauna Loa. However, analysis of the chemical composition of lavas from the two volcanoes show that they have separate [[magma chamber]]s, and are thus distinct. Nonetheless, their proximity has led to a historical trend in which high activity at one volcano roughly coincides with low activity at the other. When K<U+012B>lauea lay dormant between 1934 and 1952, Mauna Loa became active, and when the latter remained quiet from 1952 to 1974, the reverse was true. This is not always the case; the 1984 eruption of Mauna Loa started during an eruption at K<U+012B>lauea, but had no discernible effect on the K<U+012B>lauea eruption, and the ongoing inflation of Mauna Loa's summit, indicative of a future eruption, began the same day as new lava flows at K<U+012B>lauea's [[Puu Oo|Pu{{okina}}u <U+014C>{{okina}}<U+014D>]] crater. Geologists have suggested that "pulses" of magma entering Mauna Loa's deeper magma system may have increased pressure inside K<U+012B>lauea and triggered the concurrent eruptions.<ref name="hvo-loa_kilauea">{{cite web|title=Inflation of Mauna Loa Volcano slows|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]<U+2014>[[United States Geological Survey]]|work=Volcano Watch|date=28 January 2003|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/2003/03_01_23.html|accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref>

Mauna Loa is slumping eastward along its southwestern rift zone, leveraging its mass into K<U+012B>lauea and driving the latter eastward at a rate of about {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year; the interaction between the two volcanoes in this manner has generated a number of large earthquakes in the past, and has resulted in a significant area of debris off of K<U+012B>lauea's seaward flank known as the [[Hilina Slump]]. A system of older faults exists on the southeastern side of Mauna Loa that likely formed before Kilauea became large enough to impede Mauna Loa's slump, the lowest and northernmost of which, the Kaoiki fault, remains an active earthquake center today. The west side of Mauna Loa, meanwhile, is unimpeded in movement, and indeed is believed to have undergone a massive slump collapse between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, the residue from which, consisting of a scattering of debris up to several kilometers wide and up to {{convert|50|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} distant, is still visible today. The damage was so extensive that the headwall of the damage likely intersected its southwestern rift zone. There is very little movement there today, a consequence of the volcano's geometry.<ref name=uh-landslides>{{cite web|title=Giant Landslides: Kilauea and Mauna Loa: GEOL 205: Lecture Notes|url=http://hilo.hawaii.edu/~kenhon/GEOL205/Landslides/default.htm|publisher=[[University of Hawaii at Hilo]]|accessdate=16 December 2012|author=Ken Hon}}</ref>

To have reached its enormous size within its relatively short (geologically speaking) 600,000 to 1,000,000 years of life, Mauna Loa would logically have had to have grown extremely rapidly through its developmental history,<ref name=hvo-erupt /> and extensive [[charcoal]]-based [[radiocarbon dating]] (perhaps the most extensive such prehistorical eruptive dating on Earth<ref name=soest-erupt /><ref name=hvo-model>{{cite web|title=Eruption History: A Cyclic Eruption Model is Proposed|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/maunaloa/history/model.html|publisher=HVO|accessdate=25 December 2012|date=16 March 1998}}</ref>) has amassed a record of almost two hundred<!-- ~200 in the 2006 HVO eruption summary, 170 is the older 1980s era papers --> reliably dated extant flows confirming this hypothesis.<ref name=hvo-erupt />

The oldest exposed flows on Mauna Loa are thought to be the Ninole Hills on its southern flank, subaerial [[basalt]] rock dating back approximately 100 to 200 thousand years. They form a terrace against which younger flows have since banked, heavily eroded and incised against its slope in terms of direction; this is believed to be the result of a period of erosion because of a change in the direction of lava flow caused by the volcano's prehistoric slump. These are followed by two units of lava flows separated by an intervening [[volcanic ash|ash]] layer known as the P<U+0101>hala ash layer: the older Kahuka basalt, sparsely exposed on the lower southwest rift, and the younger and far more widespread Ka{{okina}}u basalt, which appear more widely on the volcano. The P<U+0101>hala ashes themselves were produced over a long period of time circa 13 to 30 thousand years ago, although heavy [[vitrification]] and interactions with post and pre- creation flows has hindered exact dating. Their age roughly corresponding with the glaciation of Mauna Loa during the last ice age, raising the distinct possibility that it is the product of [[phreatomagmatic eruption|phreatomagmatic]] interaction between the long-gone glaciers and Mauna Loa's eruptive activities.<ref name=usgs-map />

Studies have shown that a cycle occurs in which volcanic activity at the summit is dominant for several hundred years, after which activity shifts to the rift zones for several more centuries, and then back to the summit again. Two cycles have been clearly identified, each lasting 1,500&ndash;2,000&nbsp;years. This cyclical behavior is unique to Mauna Loa among the Hawaiian volcanoes.<ref>Lockwood J.P.

Mauna Loa's 1942 eruption occurred only four months after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and United States entry into [[World War II]], and created a unique problem for the wartime United States. Occurring during an enforced nighttime [[Blackout (wartime)|blackout]] on the island, the eruption's luminosity forced the government to issue a [[gag order]] on the local press, hoping to prevent news of its occurrence spreading for fear that the Japanese would use it to launch a bombing run on the island. However, as flows from the eruption rapidly spread down the volcano's flank and threatened the {{okina}}Ola{{okina}}a [[flume]], [[Mountain View, Hawaii|Mountain View]]'s primary [[water source]], the [[United States Air Force]] decided to drop its own bombs on the island in the hopes of redirecting the flows away from the flume; sixteen bombs weighing between {{convert|300|and|600|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} each were dropped on the island, but produced little effect. Eventually the eruption ceased on its own.<ref name="seach"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Shhh!

Following a 1949 event the next major eruption at Mauna Loa occurred in 1950. Originating from the volcano's southwestern rift zone, the eruption remains the largest rift event in the volcano's modern history, lasting 23 days, emitting 376 million cubic meters of lava, and reaching {{convert|24|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} out to the ocean within 3 hours. The 1950 eruption was not the most voluminous eruption on the volcano (the long-lived 1872-1877 event produced more than twice as much material) but it was easily one of the fastest-acting, producing the same amount of lava as the 1859 eruption in a tenth of the time.<ref name=hvo-1950/> Flows overtook the village of Ho{{okina}}okena-mauka in [[South Kona, Hawaii|South Kona]], crossed [[Hawaii Belt Road|Hawaii Route 11]], and reached the sea within four hours of eruption, and although there was no loss of life the village was permanently destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 1950 eruption of Mauna Loa: a nightmare that could reoccur|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/archive/2001/01_05_10.html|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]<U+2014>[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=24 January 2013|date=May 14, 2001}}</ref> After the 1950 event Mauna Loa entered an extended period of dormancy, interrupted only by a small single-day summit event in 1975.

===Hazards===
{{Decade Volcanoes Map|left}}
Mauna Loa has been designated a [[Decade Volcano]], one of the sixteen volcanoes identified by the [[International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior]] (IAVCEI) as being worthy of particular study in light of their history of large, destructive eruptions and proximity to populated areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/DecadeVolcanoes/|title=Decade Volcanoes|work=[[Cascades Volcano Observatory]]|author=[[International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior]]|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|year=1998|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Decade Volcano Program IDNDR - IAVCEI - 1990/2000|url=http://www.sveurop.org/gb/program/program.htm|publisher=Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Volcanologique Europ<U+00E9>enne|author=Nick Varley|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref> The [[United States Geological Survey]] maintains a [[Lava Flow Hazard Zones|hazard zone mapping]] of the island done on a one to nine scale, with the most dangerous areas corresponding the smallest numbers. Based on this classification Mauna Loa's continuously active summit caldera and rift zones have been given a level one designation. Much of the area immediately surrounding the rift zones is considered level two, and about 20 percent of the area has been covered in lava in historical times. Much of the remainder of the volcano is hazard level three, about 15 to 20 percent of which has been covered by flows within the last 750 years. However, two sections of the volcano, the first in the [[Naalehu, Hawaii|Naalehu]] area and the second on the southeastern flank of Mauna Loa's rift zone, are protected from eruptive activity by local topography, and have thus been designated hazard level 6, comparable with a similarly isolated segment on [[K<U+012B>lauea]].<ref name="usgs-hazard" />

Although volcanic eruptions in Hawai{{okina}}i rarely produce casualties (the only direct historical fatality due to volcanic activity on the island occurred at K<U+012B>lauea in 1924, when an unusually explosive eruption hurled rocks at an onlooker), property damage due to inundation by lava is a common and costly hazard.<ref name="usgs-hazard_all">{{cite web | author = John Watson | title = Volcanic and seismic hazards on the island of Hawaii | publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]] | url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/hazards/hazards.html |date = 18 July 1997 | accessdate = 25 January 2013}}</ref> [[Hawaiian eruption|Hawaiian]]-type eruptions usually produce extremely slow-moving flows that advance at walking pace, presenting little danger to human life, but this is not strictly the case;<ref>{{cite web|title=How Volcanoes Work: Hawaiian Eruptions|url=http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/Hawaiian.html|publisher=[[San Diego State University]]|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref> Mauna Loa's 1950 eruption emitted as much lava in three weeks as K<U+012B>lauea's current eruption produces in three years and reached sea level within four hours of its start, overrunning the village of Ho{{okina}}okena Mauka and a major highway on the way there.<ref name=hvo-1950 /> An earlier eruption in 1926 overran the village of Ho{{okina}}<U+014D>p<U+016B>loa Makai,<ref name="hvo-1926" /> and [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]], partly built on lavas from the 1880-81 eruption, is at risk from future eruptions.<ref name=usgs-hazard/> The 1984 eruption nearly reached the city, but stopped short after the flow was redirected upstream.<ref name="usgs-loa_hazards">{{cite web | url = http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/maunaloa/hazards/main.html | title = Lava flow hazards on Mauna Loa volcano | publisher = [[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]<U+2014>[[United States Geological Survey]] | date = 2 February 2006 | accessdate = 25 January 2013}}</ref>

A potentially greater hazard at Mauna Loa is a sudden, massive collapse of the volcano's flanks, like the one that struck the volcano's west flank between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago and formed the present-day [[Kealakekua Bay]].<ref name=uh-landslides/> Deep [[Fault (geology)|fault lines]] are a common feature on Hawaiian volcanoes, allowing large portions of their flanks to gradually slide downwards and forming structures like the [[Hilina Slump]] and the ancient [[Ninole Hills]]; large earthquakes could trigger rapid flank collapses along these lines, creating massive [[landslide]]s and possibly triggering equally large [[tsunami]]s.

Established on K<U+012B>lauea in 1912, the [[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]] (HVO), presently a branch of the United States Geological Survey, is the primary organization associated with the monitoring, observance, and study of Hawaiian volcanoes.<ref name=hvo-hist-intro>{{cite web|title=Thomas A.

Eruptions on Mauna Loa are almost always preceded and accompanied by prolonged episodes of seismic activity, the monitoring of which was the primary and often only warning mechanism in the past and which remains viable today. [[Seismograph|Seismic stations]] have been maintained on Hawai{{okina}}i since the Observatory's inception, but these were concentrated primarily on K<U+012B>lauea, with coverage on Mauna Loa improving only slowly through the 20th century.<ref name=hvo-seismic>{{cite web|title=HVO Seismic Network|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/earthquakes/history/|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]<U+2014>[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=26 January 2013|date=18 June 2001}}</ref> Following the invention of modern monitoring equipment, the backbone of the present-day monitoring system was installed on the volcano in the 1970s. Mauna Loa's July 1975 eruption was forewarned by more than a year of seismic unrest, with the HVO issuing warnings to the general public from late 1974; the 1984 eruption was similarly preceded by as much as three years of unusually high seismic activity, with [[volcanologist]]s predicting an eruption within two years in 1983.<ref name=hov-monitoring_data>{{cite web|title=Long-term Monitoring Data|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/maunaloa/current/monitoringdata.php|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]<U+2014>[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref>

The modern monitoring system on Mauna Loa is constituted not only by its locally seismic network but also of a large number of [[GPS]] stations, [[tiltmeter]]s, and [[strainmeter]]s that have been anchored on the volcano to monitor [[Deformation (engineering)|ground deformation]] due to swelling in Mauna Loa's subterranean [[magma chamber]], which presents a more complete picture of the events proceeding eruptive activity. The GPS network is the most durable and wide-ranging of the three systems, while the tiltmeters provide the most sensitive predictive data, but are prone to erroneous results unrelated to actual ground deformation; nonetheless a survey line across the caldera measured a {{convert|76|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} increase in its width over the year preceding the 1975 eruption, and a similar increase in 1984 eruption. Strainmeters, by contrast, are relatively rare.<ref name=hvo-monitoring_current>{{cite web|title=Mauna Loa Volcano, Hawai'i : Current Monitoring|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/maunaloa/current/currentmonitoring.php|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]<U+2014>[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref> The Observatory also maintains two [[gas detector]]s at Moku<U+02BB><U+0101>weoweo, Mauna Loa's summit caldera, as well as a publicly accessible [http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/cams/panorama.php?cam=MLcam live webcam] and occasional screenings by [[interferometric synthetic aperture radar]] imaging.<ref name=hov-monitoring_data/>

Ancient Hawaiians constructed an extensive trail system on Hawai{{okina}}i island, today known as the [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail]]. The network consisted of short trailheads servicing local areas along the main roads and more extensive networks within and around agricultural centers. The positioning of the trails were practical, connecting living areas to farms and ports and regions to resources, with a few upland sections reserved for gathering and most lines marked well enough to remain identifiable long after regular use has ended. One of these trails, the [[Ainapo Trail]], ascended from the village of Kap<U+0101>pala over {{convert|3400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in about {{convert|56|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} and ended at Moku{{okina}}<U+0101>weoweo at Mauna Loa's summit. Although the journey was arduous and required several days and many porters, ancient Hawaiians likely made the journey during eruptions to leave offerings and prayers to honor Pele, much as they did at Halema{{okina}}uma{{okina}}u, neighboring Kilauea's more active and more easily accessible caldera. Several camps established along the way supplied water and food for travelers.<ref name=nrhpinv2>{{cite web|title=National Register Of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form for Federal Properties - Ainapo Trail|url=http://www.pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/74000290.pdf|author=Russell A.

=== European summiting attempts ===
[[James Cook]]'s [[third voyage of James Cook|third voyage]] was the first to make landfall on Hawai{{okina}}i island, in 1778, and following adventures along the North American west coast Cook returned to the island in 1779. On his second visit [[John Ledyard]], a [[corporal]] of the [[Royal Marines]] aboard the [[HMS Resolution (1771)|''HMS Resolution'']], proposed and receiving approval for an expedition to summit Mauna Loa to learn "about that part of the island, particularly the peak, the tip of which is generally covered with snow, and had excited great curiosity." Using a compass, Ledyard and small group of ships' mates and native attendants attempted to make a direct course for the summit. However on the second day of traveling the route became steeper, rougher, and blocked by "impenetrable thickets," and the group was forced to abandon their attempt and return to [[Kealakekua Bay]], reckoning they had "penetrated 24 miles and we suppose [were] within 11 miles of the peak"; in reality, Moku<U+02BB><U+0101>weoweo lies only {{convert|32|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} east of the bay, a severe overestimation on Ledyard's part. Another of Cook's men, [[Lieutenant]] [[James King (Royal Navy officer)|James King]], estimated the peak to be at least {{convert|5600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high based on its [[snow line]].<ref name="earliest">{{cite journal|url=http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10524/599/JL25059.pdf?sequence=2|title=Earliest Ascents of Mauna Loa Volcano, Hawai'i |publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society, Honolulu |author=Walther M.

[[File:Archibald Menzies 1754-1842.jpg|thumb|The Scottish botanist and naturalist [[Archibald Menzies]] was the first European to reach the summit of Mauna Loa, on his third attempt.]]
The next attempt to summit Mauna Loa was an expedition led by [[Archibald Menzies]], a botanist and naturalist on the 1793 [[Vancouver Expedition]]. In February of that year Menzies, two ships' mates, and a small group of native Hawaiian attendants attempted a direct course for the summit from [[Kealakekua Bay]], making it {{convert|26|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} inland by their reckoning (an overestimation) before they were turned away by the thickness of the forest. On a second visit by the expedition to the island in January of the next year Menzies was placed in charge of exploring the island interior, and after traversing the flanks of [[Hual<U+0101>lai]] he and his party arrived at the high plateau separating the two volcanoes. Menzies decided to make a second attempt (above the objections of the accompanying island chief), but again his progress was arrested by unassailable thickets.<ref name="earliest"/>

Menzies made a third attempt to summit Mauna Loa in February of 1794. This time the botanist consulted King [[Kamehameha I]] for advice and learned that he could take canoes to the south and follow the {{okina}}Ainap<U+014D> Trail, not knowing of its existence beforehand. Significantly better prepared, Menzies, Lieutenant [[Joseph Baker (Royal Navy officer)|Joseph Baker]] and Midshipman George McKenzie of the ''Discovery'', and a servant (most likely Jonathan Ewins, listed on the ship's muster as "Botanist's L't") reached the summit, which Menzies estimated to be {{convert|4156|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high with the aid of a [[barometer]] (consistent with a modern value of {{convert|4169|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}). He was surprised to find heavy snow and morning temperatures of {{convert|-3|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, and was unable to compare the heights of Mauna Loa and Kea but correctly supposed the latter to be taller based on its larger snow cap.<ref name="earliest"/> The feat of summitting Mauna Loa was not to be repeated for forty years.<ref name="earliest"/>

The Hawaiian Islands were the site of fervent missionary work, with the first group of missionaries arrived at [[Honolulu]] in 1820 and the second in 1823. Some of these missionaries left for Hawai{{okina}}i island, and spent ten weeks traveling around it, preaching at local villages and climbing Kilauea, from which one of its members, [[William Ellis (missionary)|William Ellis]], observed Mauna Loa with the aid of a telescope and ascertained it and Kea to be "perhaps 15,000 to 16,000 feet above the level of the sea"; they did not, however, attempt to climb the volcano itself. It is sometimes reported that the missionary Joseph Goodrich reached the summit around this time, but he never claimed this himself, though he did summit Mauna Kea and describe Moku{{okina}}<U+0101>weoweo with the aid of another telescope.<ref name="measuring"/>

The next successful ascent was made on January 29, 1834, 40&nbsp;years later, by the Scottish botanist [[David Douglas]], who also reached the summit caldera using the {{okina}}Ainap<U+014D> Trail. By the time Douglas reached the summit the environment had put him under extreme duress, but he nonetheless stayed overnight to make measurements of the summit caldera's proportions and record barometric data on its height, both now known to be widely inaccurate. Douglas collected biological samples on the way both up and down, and after a difficult and distressing descent began collating his samples; he planned to return to England, but instead several months later his body was mysteriously discovered crushed in a pit besides a dead wild boar.<ref name="measuring"/>

Isidor L<U+00F6>wenstern successfully climbed Mauna Loa in February 1839, only the third successful climb in 60&nbsp;years.<ref name="earliest"/>

The [[United States Exploring Expedition]] led by Lieutenant [[Charles Wilkes]] was tasked with a vast survey of the Pacific Ocean starting in 1838.<ref>{{cite book| title=Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition |author=Charles Wilkes |year=1849 |volume=Volume IV |page=Pages 111<U+2013>162| url=http://books.google.com/?id=lbMNAAAAQAAJ| publisher=G. P. Putnam}}</ref> In September 1840 they arrived in [[Honolulu]], where repairs to the ships took longer than expected. He decided to spend the winter in Hawaii and take the opportunity to explore its volcanoes while waiting for better weather to continue the expedition. King [[Kamehameha III]] assigned American medical missionary Dr. [[Gerrit P. Judd]] to the expedition as translator.<ref name="measuring"/>

Wilkes sailed to [[Hilo]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]] and decided to climb Mauna Loa first, since it looked easier than [[Mauna Kea]]. On December 14 he hired about 200 porters, but after he left he realized only about half the equipment had been taken, so he had to hire more Hawaiians at higher pay. When they reached K<U+012B>lauea after two days, their guide Puhano headed off to the established {{okina}}Ainap<U+014D> Trail. Wilkes did not want to head back downhill so he blazed his own way through dense forest directed by a compass. The Hawaiians were offended by the waste of sacred trees which did not help morale. At about {{convert|6000|ft|m}} elevation they established a camp called "Sunday Station" at the edge of the forest.

Two guides joined them at Sunday Station: Keaweehu, "the bird-catcher" and another whose Hawaiian name is not recorded, called "ragsdale". Although Wilkes thought he was almost to the summit, the guides knew they were less than half way up. Since there was no water at Sunday Station, porters had to be sent back ten miles (16&nbsp;km) to a [[lava tube]] on {{okina}}Ainap<U+014D> Trail which had a known supply. After an entire day replenishing stocks, they continued up to a second camp they called "Recruiting Station" at about {{convert|9000|ft|m}} elevation. After another full day's hike they established "Flag Station" on December 22, and by this time were on the {{okina}}Ainap<U+014D> Trail. Most of the porters were sent back down to get another load. 

At the Flag Station Wilkes and his eight remaining men built a circular wall of lava rocks and covered the shelter with a canvas tent. A snowstorm was in progress and several suffered from [[altitude sickness]]. That night (December 23), the snow on the canvas roof caused it to collapse. At daylight some of the group went down the trail to retrieve firewood and the gear abandoned on the trail the day before. After another day's climb, nine men reached the rim of Moku{{okina}}<U+0101>weoweo. They could not find a way down its steep sides so chose a smooth place on the rim for the camp site, at coordinates {{coord|19|27|59|N|155|34|54|W| type:landmark_region:US-HI| display=inline}}. Their tent was pitched within {{convert|60|ft|m}} of the crater's edge, secured by lava blocks.<ref name="focus">{{cite web| author=Russell A. Apple

The next morning they were unable to start a fire using friction due to the thin air at that altitude, and sent for matches. By this time, the naval officers and Hawaiians could not agree on terms to continue hiring porters, so sailors and marines were ordered from the ships. Dr. Judd traveled between the summit and the Recruiting Station to tend the many who suffered from altitude sickness or had worn out their shoes on the rough rock. Christmas Day was spent building rock walls around the camp to give some protection from the high winds and blowing snow. It took another week to bring all the equipment to the summit, including a [[pendulum]] designed for measuring slight variations in gravity.<ref name="focus"/>
[[File:Moku-A-Weo-Weo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sketch of Moku{{okina}}<U+0101>weoweo from Wilkes' journal]]

On December 31, 1840 the pre-fabricated pendulum house was assembled. Axes and chisels cut away the rock surface for the pendulum's base. It took another three days to adjust the clock to the point where the experiments could begin. However, the high winds made so much noise that the ticks could often not be heard, and varied the temperature to make measurements inaccurate. Grass had to be painstakingly brought from the lowest elevations for insulation to get accurate measurements.

On Monday, January 11, Wilkes hiked around the summit crater. Using an optical method, he estimated Mauna Kea was only {{convert|193|ft|m}} higher (modern measurements are {{convert|104|ft|m}} feet).
On January 13, 1841, he had "Pendulum Peak, January 1841 U.S. Ex, Ex." cut into a rock at the site.
The tents were dismantled and Hawaiians carried the gear down over the next three days, while Wilkes enjoyed a [[lomilomi massage|lomilomi]] Hawaiian massage. He continued his measurements at lower elevations and left the island on March 5. For all the effort he did not obtain any significant results, attributing gravity discrepancies to "the tides".<ref name="measuring"/>

The Wilkes expedition's camp site's ruins are the only known physical evidence in the Pacific of the U. S. Exploring Expedition.<ref name="focus"/> The camp site was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on July 24, 1974 as site 74000295,<ref name="nris"/> and is state historic site 10-52-5507.<ref>[http://hawaii.gov/dlnr/hpd/register/reghaw.pdf Historic Places in Hawaii County] on official state web site</ref>

===Today===
A summit shelter was built with some of the stones from Wilkes' camp site and mortar in 1934. In 1916 Moku{{okina}}<U+0101>weoweo was included in [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park]], and a new trail was built directly from park headquarters at K<U+012B>lauea, an even more direct route than the one taken by Wilkes.<ref name="nrhpinv2"/> This trail, arriving at the summit from the east via Red Hill, became the preferred route due to its easier access and gentler slope. The historic [[Ainapo Trail|{{okina}}Ainap<U+014D> Trail]] fell into disuse, and was reopened in the 1990s. A third modern route to the summit is from the [[Saddle Road]] up to the [[Mauna Loa Observatory]] which is at {{convert|11135|ft|m}} elevation a few miles north of Moku{{okina}}<U+0101>weoweo and the North Pit trail.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mlo.noaa.gov |title=NOAA Mauna Loa Observatory |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] web site |accessdate=2009-07-04 }}</ref>

==Climate==
[[Trade wind]]s blow from east to west across the Hawaiian islands, and the presence of Mauna Loa strongly affects the local climate. At low elevations, the eastern (windward) side of the volcano receives heavy rain; the city of [[Hilo]] is the wettest in the United States. The rainfall supports extensive [[forest]]ation. The western (leeward) side has a much drier climate. At higher elevations, the amount of precipitation decreases, and skies are very often clear. Very low temperatures mean that precipitation often occurs in the form of snow, and the summit of Mauna Loa is described as a ''[[periglacial]]'' region, where freezing and thawing play a significant role in shaping the landscape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/HCV/mloa-flora.html|title=Mauna Loa Flora and Climate|publisher=Hawaii Center for Volcanology|year=2004|accessdate=2007-07-28|last=Rubin|first=Ken|coauthors=Rochelle Minicola}}</ref>

Mauna Loa has a [[tropical climate]] with warm temperatures at lower elevations and cool to cold temperatures higher up year-round. Below is the table for the slope observatory, which is at {{convert|10000|ft|m}} in the [[alpine climate|alpine zone]]. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|85|F|C}} and the lowest was {{convert|18|F|C}} on February&nbsp;18, 2003 and February&nbsp;20, 1962, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|work=MAUNA LOA SLOPE OBS, HAWAII|title=Period of Record General Climate Summary - Temperature|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliGCStT.pl?hi6198|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref>

The [[Mauna Loa Solar Observatory]] (MLSO), located at {{convert|11155|ft|m|0}} on the northern slope of the mountain, has long been prominent in observations of the [[Sun]]. The [[NOAA]] [[Mauna Loa Observatory]] (MLO) is located close by. From its location well above local human-generated influences, the MLO monitors the global atmosphere, including the [[greenhouse gas]] [[carbon dioxide]]. Measurements are adjusted to account for local [[outgassing]] of CO<sub>2</sub> from the volcano.<ref>Rhodes, J.M. and Lockwood, J. P.
