'''Ida Rentoul Outhwaite''', also known as  '''Ida Sherbourne Rentoul''' and '''Ida Sherbourne Outhwaite'''<ref name=adb>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |last=Langmore |first=Diane |title=Outhwaite, Ida Sherbourne (1888<U+2013>1960) |id2=outhwaite-ida-sherbourne-7933 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> 
(9 June 1888  &ndash; 25 June 1960), was an [[Australia]]n [[illustrator]] of [[children's book]]s. Her work mostly depicted [[fairy|fairies]].

Ida was born in [[Carlton, Victoria]], the youngest child of four and second daughter of the [[John Laurence Rentoul|Rev. Dr. John Laurence Rentoul]],<ref name=adb/> an Irish-born [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland|Presbyterian]] minister and academic, and his wife Annie Isobel (n<U+00E9>e Rattray). At the time of her birth Outhwaite's father was a professor at [[Ormond College]], [[University of Melbourne]], and later moderator-general of his church for 1912-14, and when the [[World War I]] broke out, chaplain-general of the Australian [[First Australian Imperial Force|military forces]].<ref name='DAB1'>{{cite book | last1 = Serle | first1 = Percival | authorlink1 = Percival Serle | title = Dictionary of Australian Biography | chapter = Rentoul, John Laurence (1846-1926) | publisher = Angus and Robertson | year = 1949 | location = Sydney, NSW | accessdate = 2010-09-03 | quote = The younger daughter, Ida Sherbourne, afterwards Mrs Outhwaite, became well known as an illustrator of fairy tales.}}</ref>  She was educated at [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne]].

She married Arthur Grenbry Outhwaite on 8 December 1909 and thereafter was generally known as Ida Rentoul Outhwaite. Before this she had variously signed her work I.S.R. and at some point changed this to I.R.O. She also occasionally used I.S.R.O. and full spellings rather than abbreviations.

Outhwaite worked predominantly with pen and ink, and [[watercolour]]. 

Outhwaite's first illustration was published by ''[[New Idea]]'' magazine in 1904 when she was just 15 years of age - it accompanied a story written by her older sister, Anne Rattray Rentoul. In the years that followed, the sisters collaborated on a number of stories. Following her marriage to Grenbry Outhwaite in 1909, she also collaborated with her husband - most notably for ''The Enchanted Forest'' (1921), ''The Little Fairy Sister'' (1923) and ''Fairyland'' (1926). In a number of cases, her children - Robert, Anne, Wendy and William - served as models for her illustrations.

Her illustrations were exhibited throughout Australia, as well as in London and Paris between 1907 and 1933. She died in [[Caulfield, Victoria]], [[Australia]]. 

Publications carrying her illustrations include:
* ''Mollie's Bunyip'' (1904);
* ''Mollie's Staircase'' (1906);
* ''Gum Tree Brownie and other Faerie Folk of the Never Never'' (1907);
* ''Before the Lamps are Lit'' (1911);
* ''Elves and Fairies'' (1916);
* ''The Enchanted Forest'' (1921);
* ''The Little Green Road to Fairyland'' (1922);
* ''The Little Fairy Sister'' (1923);
* ''The Sentry and the Shell Fairy'' (1924);
* ''Fairyland'' (1926);
* ''Blossom: A Fairy Story'' (1928);
* ''Bunny and Brownie: The Adventures of George and Wiggle'' (1930); and
* ''A Bunch of Wild Flowers'' (1933).

Her works were also published in periodicals and newspapers such as ''The New Idea'', ''The Native Companion'', ''Australia Today'' and the ''British-Australasian''.

Her work is depicted in four stained glass windows in an adjoining hall at St Mark's Anglican Church in [[Fitzroy, Victoria]].

In 1985 she was honoured on a [[postage stamp]], depicting an illustration from ''Elves and Fairies'', issued by [[Australia Post]].[http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0015470.jpg]
