''Roe v.

==Supreme Court decision==
[[File:US Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, detail.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Harry Blackmun]] wrote the Court<U+2019>s opinion.]]  The court issued its decision on January 22, 1973, with a 7 to 2 majority vote in favor of McCorvey.  Burger and Douglas' concurring opinion and White's dissenting opinion were issued separately, in the companion case of ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]''.

The ''Roe'' Court deemed abortion a [[fundamental right]] under the [[United States Constitution]], thereby subjecting all laws attempting to restrict it to the standard of [[strict scrutiny]]. Although abortion is still considered a fundamental right, subsequent cases, notably ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', and ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' have affected the legal standard.

The opinion of the ''Roe'' Court, written by Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], declined to adopt the district court's [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] rationale, and instead asserted that the "right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."  Douglas, in his concurring opinion from the companion case ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', stated more emphatically that, "The Ninth Amendment obviously does not create federally enforceable rights."  Thus, the ''Roe'' majority rested its opinion squarely on the Constitution's [[due process clause]].

The majority opinion is organized into twelve sections preceded by a brief preface; the first four sections provide background.  '''Section I'''<ref>{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=117}}</ref> briefly outlines the challenged '''[[Texas abortion statutes]]'''.  '''Section II'''<ref>{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=120}}</ref> characterizes the factual and procedural backgrounds of Jane Roe's and Mary Doe's litigation, including the District Court's rulings regarding the procedural questions (here, [[justiciability]], [[standing]], and [[abstention]]) and the merits (here, the requests for [[declaratory judgment]] and [[injunctive relief]]).  '''Section III'''<ref>{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=123}}</ref> is a single paragraph resolving that under the law of [[Federal Court procedure]], the opinions in [[Mitchell v. Donovan]] and [[Gunn v. University Committee]] do not foreclose review a case of this kind when it is properly here on appeal under <U+00A7> 1253.   '''Section IV'''<ref>{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=123}}</ref> issues the court's decision on the procedural questions described in Part II.

'''Section V'''<ref>{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=129}}</ref> is a single paragraph introducing the discussion of the merits, led by the following:
{{cquote|The principal thrust of appellant's attack on the Texas statutes is that they improperly invade a right, said to be possessed by the pregnant woman, to choose to terminate her pregnancy. Appellant would discover this right in the concept of personal "liberty" embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause; or in personal, marital, familial, and sexual privacy said to be protected by the Bill of Rights or its penumbras ... or among those rights reserved to the people by the Ninth Amendment ...}}

'''Section VI'''<ref>{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=129}}</ref> surveys the history of abortion regulations, in eight subparts: ''1. Ancient attitudes (including those of the [[Persia|Persian Empire]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek times]], the [[Roman era]]). 2. The [[Hippocratic oath]]. 3. The [[common law]].  4. The English [[statutory law]].  5. The American law.  6. The position of the [[American Medical Association]].  7. The position of the [[American Public Health Association]]. 8. The position of the [[American Bar Association]].  According to the ''Roe'' Court, "the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively recent vintage."  Prior to 1821, when Connecticut passed the first state statute criminalizing abortion, [[abortion in the United States]] was sometimes considered a common law crime.<ref>[[James Wilson|Wilson, James]], "[http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=831 Of the Natural Rights of Individuals]" (1790-1792): <U+201C>In the contemplation of law, life begins when the infant is first able to stir in the womb.<U+201D>  Also see [[William Blackstone|Blackstone, William]].

Via Google Books.  Retrieved ([[2008-04-08]]).</ref>  However, the court concluded that it could not find a sufficient historical basis to justify [[Texas abortion statutes (1961)|the Texas statute]].

In '''Section VII''',<ref>{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=147}}</ref> the Court identified three state interests that could be cited to justify criminalizing abortion: (1) an interest in discouraging women from engaging in "illicit sexual conduct", which interest would be undermined by making abortion widely available; (2) an interest in reducing access to a risky medical procedure<U+2014>which abortion could still be in the late stages of pregnancy, despite modern medical techniques such as [[antibiotic]]s; and (3) an interest in protecting prenatal life.  Blackmun rejected the first interest out-of-hand, writing that "no court or commentator has taken the argument seriously" and that in any event it could not be cited in support of this statute, which failed to "distinguish between married and unwed mothers".  Accordingly, the only valid state interests are reducing medical risk and protecting prenatal life.  (In Section X, the Court reiterated, "[T]he State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman [and] still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.")  Thus, "arguments that Texas either has no valid interest at all in regulating the abortion decision, or no interest strong enough to support any limitation upon the woman's sole determination, are unpersuasive".

In '''Section VIII''',<ref>{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=152}}</ref> the Court also identified a countervailing right that would have to be weighed against these state interests: namely, a Constitutional right to privacy: "We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation."  The innovation of the ''Roe'' court was to locate this "right of privacy" in the due process clause of the Constitution.  Although the Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy, the Court had previously found support for various privacy rights<U+2014>directly (in several provisions of the [[Bill of Rights]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]) as well as indirectly (in the "[[wiktionary:penumbra|penumbra]]" of the Bill of Rights) -- most recently in [[Griswold v. Connecticut]]. 

In '''Section IX''',<ref>{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=156}}</ref> the Court added that there was no legal grounds for factoring into this balancing test any [[right to life]] of the unborn [[fetus]].  The fetus would have such a right if it were defined as a legal person for purposes of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], but the [[original intent]] of the Constitution (up to the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868) did not include protection of the unborn.  The Court emphasized that its determination of whether a fetus can enjoy constitutional protection neither meant to reference, nor intervene in, the question of when life begins:  "We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of [[medicine]], [[philosophy]], and [[theology]] are unable to arrive at any consensus, the [[judiciary]], at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer."

'''Section X'''<ref>{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=162}}</ref> explained that the [[trimester]] of pregnancy is highly relevant to the weight of the factors in this balancing test.  Thus, during the first trimester, the state cannot restrict a woman's right to an abortion in any way; during the second trimester, the state may only regulate the abortion procedure "in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health"; during the third trimester, the state can choose to restrict or [[proscription|proscribe]] abortion as it sees fit when the fetus is viable ("except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother").

'''Section XI'''<ref>{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=164}}</ref> succinctly summarizes the Court's legal conclusions, explaining that a Texas-style criminal statute was unconstitutional, and recapitulating the permissible extent of state regulation in each of the three Constitutionally relevant time periods of pregnancy (i.e. divided by "approximately the end of the first trimester" and "the stage subsequent to viability").  '''Section XII'''<ref>{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=166}}</ref> resolves the present dispute: it struck down the Texas statute and characterized the relief that should be accorded to Roe.

===Justiciability===
An aspect of the decision that attracted comparatively little attention was the Court's disposition of the issues of [[Standing (law)|standing]] and [[mootness]].  Under the traditional interpretation of these rules, Jane Roe's appeal was "moot" because she had already given birth to her child and thus would not be affected by the ruling; she also lacked "standing" to assert the rights of other pregnant women.<ref>Abernathy, M. et al., ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0872498549&id=tHhlYpWokFIC&pg=RA1-PA4&lpg=RA1-PA4&ots=OeQSTLp91C&dq=standing+and+mootness+and+%22roe+v.+wade%22&num=100&sig=gfDTMq-LyUVI-lg8tNreUQFjX6c Civil Liberties Under the Constitution]'' (U. South Carolina 1993), page 4.  Retrieved [[2007-02-04]].</ref>  As she did not present an "actual [[case or controversy]]" (a grievance and a demand for relief), any opinion issued by the Supreme Court would constitute an [[advisory opinion]], a practice in which the Court traditionally did not engage.

The Court concluded that the case came within an established exception to the rule; one that allowed consideration of an issue that was "capable of repetition, yet evading review." This phrase had been coined in 1911 by Justice [[Joseph McKenna]].<ref>''Southern Pacific v. Interstate Commerce Commission'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=219&invol=498 219 U.S. 498] (1911).  Findlaw.com.  Retrieved [[2007-01-26]]</ref> Blackmun's opinion quoted McKenna, and noted that pregnancy would normally conclude more quickly than an appellate process: "If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied."

==Dissents==
[[Image:Justice White Official.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Byron White]] was the senior dissenting justice.]]
Associate Justices [[Byron R. White]] and [[William H. Rehnquist]] wrote emphatic dissenting opinions in this case.  Justice White wrote:
{{cquote|I find nothing in the language or history of the Constitution to support the Court's judgment.  The Court simply fashions and announces a new constitutional right for pregnant mothers and, with scarcely any reason or authority for its action, invests that right with sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion statutes. The upshot is that the people and the legislatures of the 50 States are constitutionally disentitled to weigh the relative importance of the continued existence and development of the fetus, on the one hand, against a spectrum of possible impacts on the mother, on the other hand. As an exercise of raw judicial power, the Court perhaps has authority to do what it does today; but, in my view, its judgment is an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review that the Constitution extends to this Court.<ref name="Doe" />}}

White asserted that the Court "values the convenience of the pregnant mother more than the continued existence and development of the life or potential life that she carries." Despite White suggesting he "might agree" with the Court's values and priorities, he wrote that he saw "no constitutional warrant for imposing such an order of priorities on the people and legislatures of the States."  White criticized the Court for involving itself in this issue by creating "a constitutional barrier to state efforts to protect human life and by investing mothers and doctors with the constitutionally protected right to exterminate it."  He would have left this issue, for the most part, "with the people and to the political processes the people have devised to govern their affairs."

Rehnquist elaborated upon several of White's points, by asserting that the Court's historical analysis was flawed:

{{cquote|To reach its result, the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment.  As early as 1821, the first state law dealing directly with abortion was enacted by the Connecticut Legislature.  By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, there were at least 36 laws enacted by state or territorial legislatures limiting abortion. While many States have amended or updated their laws, 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect today.<ref name="Roe">''Roe v. Wade'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=410&page=113 410 U.S. 113] (1973). Findlaw.com.  Retrieved [[2007-01-26]]</ref>}}

From this historical record, Rehnquist concluded that, "There apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted." Therefore, in his view, "the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter."

Advocates of ''Roe'' describe it as vital to preservation of [[women's rights]], personal freedom, and privacy (despite the Roe opponents' argument that abortion takes advantage of and harms women).  Denying the abortion right has been equated to compulsory motherhood, and some scholars (not including any member of the Supreme Court) have argued that abortion bans therefore violate the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]:

{{cquote|When women are compelled to carry and bear children, they are subjected to 'involuntary servitude' in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment<U+2026>.[E]ven if the woman has stipulated to have consented to the risk of pregnancy, that does not permit the state to force her to remain pregnant.<ref name="Koppelman" />}}

Opponents of ''Roe'' have objected that the decision lacks a valid constitutional foundation.  Like the dissenters in ''Roe'', they have maintained that the Constitution is silent on the issue, and that proper solutions to the question would best be found via state legislatures and the [[democracy|democratic]] process, rather than through an all-encompassing ruling from the Supreme Court. Supporters of ''Roe'' contend that the decision has a valid constitutional foundation, or contend that justification for the result in ''Roe'' could be found in the Constitution but not in the articles referenced in the decision.<ref name="Koppelman">Koppelman, Andrew.

The most prominent organized groups that mobilized in response to ''Roe'' are the [[NARAL Pro-Choice America|National Abortion Rights Action League]] on the pro-choice side, and the [[National Right to Life Committee]] on the pro-life side.  The late Harry Blackmun, author of the ''Roe'' opinion, was a determined advocate for the decision.  Others have joined him in support of ''Roe'', including [[Judith Jarvis Thomson]], who before the decision had offered an influential defense of abortion.<ref>Thomson, Judith. "[[A Defense of Abortion]]," in ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'', vol. 1, no. 1 (1971), pp. 47<U+2013>66.</ref>

''Roe'' remains controversial. [[Abortion in the United States#Public opinion|Polls]] show continued division about its landmark rulings, and about the decision as a whole.

===Internal memoranda===
Internal Supreme Court memoranda surfaced in the [[Library of Congress]] in 1988, among the personal papers of Douglas and other Justices, showing the private discussions of the Justices on the case. Blackmun said of the majority decision he authored, "You will observe that I have concluded that the end of the first trimester is critical. This is arbitrary, but perhaps any other selected point, such as quickening or viability, is equally arbitrary."<ref>Woodward, Bob.

The assertion that the Supreme Court was making a legislative decision is often repeated by opponents of the Court's decision.<ref>Bush, George Walker. Quoted in ''Boston Globe'', p. A12 ([[2000-01-22]]). "Roe v. Wade was wrong because it 'usurped the power of the legislatures,' Bush said. 'I felt like it was a case where the court took the place of what legislatures should do in America,' he said. But Bush refused to say how he felt each state should act. Instead, he said that when it comes to legalizing abortion, 'it should be up to each legislature.'" Retrieved [[2007-02-02]].</ref> The "viability" criterion, which Blackmun acknowledged was arbitrary, is still in effect, although the point of viability has changed as medical science has found ways to help premature babies survive.<ref>Stith, Irene.

===Liberal critiques===
[[Modern liberalism in the United States|Liberal]] and [[feminist]] legal scholars have had various reactions to ''Roe'', not always giving the decision unqualified support. One reaction has been to argue that Justice Blackmun reached the correct result but went about it the wrong way.<ref>[[Jack Balkin|Balkin, Jack]].

Carhart'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=530&page=914 530 U.S. 914] (2000).  Retrieved [[2007-02-02]].</ref>  The Supreme Court struck down the Nebraska ban by a 5-4 vote in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'' (2000), citing a right to use the safest method of second trimester abortion.

Kennedy, who had co-authored the 5-4 ''Casey'' decision upholding ''Roe'', was among the dissenters in ''Stenberg'', writing that Nebraska had done nothing unconstitutional.<ref name="Stenberg"/>  Kennedy described the second trimester abortion procedure that Nebraska was ''not'' seeking to prohibit: "The fetus, in many cases, dies just as a human adult or child would: It bleeds to death as it is torn from limb from limb. The fetus can be alive at the beginning of the dismemberment process and can survive for a time while its limbs are being torn off."  Kennedy wrote that since this dilation and evacuation procedure remained available in Nebraska, the state was free to ban the other procedure sometimes called "partial birth abortion."<ref name="Stenberg"/>

The remaining three dissenters in ''Stenberg''{{ndash}} Thomas, Scalia, and Rehnquist{{ndash}} disagreed again with ''Roe'': "Although a State may permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a State must do so."

===''Gonzales v. Carhart''===
{{Main|Gonzales v. Carhart}}
In 2003, Congress passed the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]], which led to a lawsuit in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''.  The Court had previously ruled in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'' that a state's ban on "partial birth abortion" was unconstitutional because such a ban would not allow for the health of the mother.  The membership of the Court changed after ''Stenberg'', with [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]] and [[Samuel Alito]] replacing Rehnquist and O'Connor, respectively.  Further, the ban at issue in ''Gonzales v. Carhart'' was a federal statute, rather than a relatively vague state statute as in the ''Stenberg'' case.

On April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court handed down a 5 to 4 decision upholding the constitutionality of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Kennedy wrote for the five-justice majority that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left the door open for as-applied challenges.  Kennedy's opinion did not reach the question whether the Court's prior decisions in ''Roe v. Wade'', ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'', and ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' were valid, and instead the Court said that the challenged statute is consistent with those prior decisions whether or not those prior decisions were valid.

Joining the majority were Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]], Scalia, Thomas, and Alito. Ginsburg and the other three justices dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent, and also offering an equality-based justification for that abortion precedent. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in ''Roe v. Wade'' and ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' should be reversed, and also noting that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act may exceed the powers of Congress under the [[Commerce Clause]].

===Activities of Norma McCorvey===
[[Norma McCorvey]] became a member of the pro-life movement in 1995; she now supports making abortion illegal.  In 1998, she testified to Congress:
{{cquote|It was my pseudonym, Jane Roe, which had been used to create the "right" to abortion out of legal thin air. But Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee never told me that what I was signing would allow women to come up to me 15, 20 years later and say, "Thank you for allowing me to have my five or six abortions. Without you, it wouldn't have been possible."  Sarah never mentioned women using abortions as a form of birth control. We talked about truly desperate and needy women, not women already wearing maternity clothes.<ref name="testimony">McCorvey, Norma.

Retrieved [[2007-01-27]]</ref>}}

As a party to the original litigation, she sought to reopen the case in [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] in Texas to have ''Roe v. Wade'' overturned.  However, the [[Fifth Circuit]] decided that her case was moot, in ''[[McCorvey v. Hill]]''.<ref>''McCorvey v. Hill'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/5th/0310711p.pdf 385 F3d 846 (PDF)] (5th Cir 2004).  Findlaw.com.  Retrieved [[2007-01-26]]</ref>  In a concurring opinion, Judge [[Edith Jones]] agreed that McCorvey was raising legitimate questions about emotional and other harm suffered by women who have had abortions, about increased resources available for the care of unwanted children, and about new scientific understanding of fetal development, but Jones said she was compelled to agree that the case was moot.  On February 22, 2005, the Supreme Court refused to grant a [[certiorari|writ of certiorari]], and McCorvey's appeal ended.
