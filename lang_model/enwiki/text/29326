'''''Automonopoli''''', also known as '''''Go to Jail''''', was an unauthorised computer version of the boardgame ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', released in June 1983 by [[Automata UK]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]]. Although other two-player ''Monopoly'' computer programs already existed, the developer advertised that their ''Automonopoli'' was the first with an [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] strong enough to compete against and defeat human players.

Initially released under the name ''Automonopoli'', [[Waddingtons]] threatened legal action against Automata, and within weeks of its release the game was rebranded as ''Go to Jail''. Waddingtons, concerned about the potential impact on a forthcoming official [[Monopoly (video games)|''Monopoly'' video game]], began formal court proceedings against Automata in late 1983, and the game was withdrawn from sale in early 1984.

Rather than display the entire board, only two full spaces (and a section of a third) are displayed at one time during gameplay.<ref name ="ZX Oct 83">{{cite journal |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |date=Oct<U+2013>Nov 1983 |title=Automonopoli<!--Previous title (?): Monopoly!--> |url=https://archive.org/stream/zxcomputing-magazine-1983-10/ZXComputing_1983_10#page/n19/ |journal=ZX Computing |publisher=Argus |volume=1 |issue=9 |pages=20 |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> The board scrolls from right to left as the player advances following each dice roll, while pressing the "X" key takes the player to a separate screen showing a full list of sites and their current ownership, allowing players to buy and sell properties between themselves, to build houses and hotels, and to mortgage and unmortgage properties. On landing on a property the player is offered the chance to buy it; if the player declines, or they have insufficient funds, the property is put up for auction. The game copies the UK version of the ''Monopoly'' board game in every significant detail, including the exact wording of the property names and "chance" cards.<ref name="ZX Apr 84" />

Sold almost exclusively by mail order, the game received limited but positive reviews on its release from the few magazines which then covered ZX Spectrum gaming.

== Legal action and change of name ==
Shortly after its release, [[Waddingtons]], UK publishers of the ''Monopoly'' boardgame, raised objections to the ''Automonopoli'' title, saying that there was a risk purchasers would confuse the two products.<ref name="PCW Dec 83">{{cite journal |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |date=22 Dec 1983<U+2013>4 Jan 1984 |title=Monopoly game makers in new battle |url=https://archive.org/stream/popular-computing-weekly-1983-12-22/PopularComputing_Weekly_Issue_1983-12-22#page/n3/ |journal=Popular Computing Weekly |publisher=Sunshine Publications |volume=2 |issue=51 |pages=5 |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> Automata changed the name of the product to ''Go to Jail'' in their packaging and advertising,<ref name="PCW Dec 83" /> claiming in their advertising that despite being identical in every way, ''Go to Jail'' was unrelated to ''Automonopoli''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Croucher |first=Mel |authorlink1=Mel Croucher |last2= |first2= |date=21<U+2013>27 Jul 1983 |title='Go To Jail' legal sensation |url=https://archive.org/stream/popular-computing-weekly-1983-07-21/PopularComputing_Weekly_Issue_1983-07-21#page/n47/ |journal=Popular Computing Weekly |publisher=Sunshine Publications |volume=2 |issue=29 |pages=48 |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref>

Waddingtons was in talks with [[Parker Brothers]] (the US publisher of ''Monopoly'') over jointly developing an official ''Monopoly'' computer game, and continued to object to perceived infringement by Automata;<ref name="PCW Dec 83" /> Waddingtons spokesman Neville Fishwick said "They are riding on the back of a game we have had for 50 years. They know damn well it's not their game, it's ours".<ref name="HCW Jan 84">{{cite journal |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |date=10<U+2013>16 Jan 1984 |title='Monopoly': judge orders sales halt |url=https://archive.org/stream/home-computing-weekly-044/Home_Computing_Weekly_044#page/n0/ |journal=Home Computing Weekly |publisher=Argus |volume= |issue=44 |pages=1<U+2013>5 |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> In December 1983 Waddingtons began court proceedings against Automata; Automata in turn launched a fundraising campaign with the support of the [[Computer Trade Association]], whose secretary Nigel Blackhurst said "The Waddingtons action represents a major threat to the whole computing industry. If they win about 80 per cent of the games software in the market would become challengable".<ref name="PCW Dec 83" />

In January 1984, the courts ordered Automata to withdraw the program from sale.<ref name="HCW Jan 84" /> In May 1984 Waddingtons announced that the official ZX Spectrum version of ''Monopoly'' would be released shortly by [[Leisure Genius]], although Waddingtons would retain the responsibility for taking legal action against the publishers of other computer games based on the board game.<ref>{{cite journal |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |date=3<U+2013>9 May 1984 |title=Monopoly money for Leisure |url=https://archive.org/stream/popular-computing-weekly-1984-05-03/PopularComputing_Weekly_Issue_1984-05-03#page/n3/ |journal=Popular Computing Weekly |publisher=Sunshine Publications |volume=3 |issue=18 |pages=5 |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> The official [[Monopoly (video games)|''Monopoly'' video game]] was eventually released in July 1985,<ref name="HCW Jul 85">{{cite journal |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |date=Jul 23<U+2013>29, 1985 |title=Monopoly |url=https://archive.org/stream/home-computing-weekly-122/Home_Computing_Weekly_122#page/n17/ |journal=Home Computing Weekly |publisher=Argus |volume= |issue=122 |pages=19 |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> and was described as{{by whom|date=May 2014}} "vastly superior to the other non-authorised versions".<ref name="HCW Jul 85" />
