The '''Godesberg Memorandum''' is a document issued by [[Adolf Hitler]] in the early hours of 24 September 1938 concerning the [[Sudetenland]] and amounting to an [[ultimatum]] addressed to the government of [[Czechoslovakia]]. 

It was named after [[Bad Godesberg]], where Hitler had met [[Neville Chamberlain]] for long talks on 23 September continuing into the next day. 

==Background==
{{Main|Sudeten Germans}}
At the time of the collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the [[Sudetenland]] was a German-speaking part of the Empire which fell the new state of Czechoslovakia, itself dominated by the [[Czechs]]. Initially, many [[Sudeten Germans]] wished to become part of the new German-speaking state of [[Republic of German-Austria|German Austria]], and later they hoped to join [[Austria]]. However, the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] of 1919 confirmed the inclusion of the German-speaking territories within Czechoslovakia. By the beginning of 1938 most Sudetens aspired to be integrated into [[Nazi Germany]], which was fast advancing in economic success and international prestige.

Following an active [[propaganda]] campaign, Adolf Hitler began publicly to demand the "return" to Germany of a large part of the Sudetenland containing some three million German speakers.<ref>S. N. Sen, ''Contemporary World'', p. 61</ref> In March 1938 [[France]] and the [[Soviet Union]] gave guarantees of military support if Hitler began to use military force to seize the Sudetenland, but on 24 March [[Neville Chamberlain]] refused a French request to give the same pledge.<ref>Sen, pp. 61<U+2013>62</ref> 

In early September 1938, Chamberlain sent [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Lord Runciman]] to attempt to negotiate a settlement of the crisis between the Germans and the Czechs. On 7 September the Sudetens, led by [[Konrad Henlein]], broke off the talks with Runciman, and on 12 September Hitler publicly advised the Sudetens to stand firm for union with Germany. On 15 September Chamberlain flew to [[Berchtesgaden]] to meet Hitler, who demanded [[self determination]] for the Sudetenland. Chamberlain returned home and had discussions with the French, in which he agreed with them a joint proposal to all parties for the gradual transfer to Germany of the areas which had a majority of Sudeten Germans. He then returned to Germany, meeting Hitler on 22 September at [[Bad Godesberg]] to propose this solution. Hitler's response was to demand again an immediate transfer, including occupation of the Sudetenland by German forces, and he quickly issued the "Godesberg Memorandum" to clarify his public position.<ref name=sen62>Sen, p. 62</ref>

==The Memorandum==
In his Memorandum Hitler proposed a [[plebiscite]], without identifying the exact area for it, and provided for the plebiscite areas to be occupied by both German and Czech forces, pending the outcome of voting. German forces should enter the Sudetenland by 1 October.<ref>Terrance L. Lewis, ''Prisms of British Appeasement'' (2011), p. 150</ref> 
The arrangements for the transfer were to be decided bilaterally between the Germans and the Czechs and by no one else.<ref>Neville Chamberlain, ''In Search of Peace''</ref>

The memorandum stated an ultimatum for Czech acceptance of it, expiring at 2 pm on 28 September 1938. If the Czech government would not agree to Hitler's demands by then, Germany would take the Sudetenland by force.<ref>''Life'' dated 26 April 1948, p. 74</ref>

==Response and outcome==
{{Main|Munich Agreement}}
The Czechs announced on 28 September that they rejected the Memorandum, and the French ordered the mobilization of 600,000 men. The [[Royal Navy]] was also mobilized the same day.<ref name=sen62/>

Although Hitler was angry at the rejection of his memorandum, at that point he also feared a war against both Britain and France.<ref>Michael C. Thomsett, ''The German Opposition to Hitler: The Resistance, the Underground, ...'' (2007), p. 121: "Hitler was furious upon hearing that the British, French, and Czechs had all rejected his Godesberg memorandum. Hitler knew, however, that Germany's armed forces were no match for those of France and Britain."</ref> He did not order an invasion on 28 September, having instead agreed to Chamberlain's proposal for a further meeting the next day, this time at [[Munich]], between four heads of Government, Chamberlain for Britain, Hitler for Germany, [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[<U+00C9>douard Daladier|Daladier]] for France, and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] for Italy, with no Czech or Soviet participation. On 1 October a pact was signed which provided for possession of the Sudeten Province to be transferred to Germany, with Britain and France seeking to sweeten this bitter pill for the Czechs by guaranteeing the new borders of Czechoslovakia. There was also a separate agreement between the British and the Germans which stated that all future disputes between them would be the subject of negotiation.<ref name=sen62/>

On 1 October German troops marched into the Sudetenland, which was immediately incorporated into Germany. Some 115,000 Sudeten Czechs and 30,000 Sudeten Germans, including Social Democrats, Communists, and Jews, fled to what was left of Czechoslovakia. By 1 March 1939 the number of refugees, as reported by the Institute for Refugee Assistance, stood at almost 150,000.<ref>[http://www.radio.cz/en/article/46238 Forced displacement of Czech population under Nazis in 1938 and 1943] at radio.cz, accessed 27 March 2012</ref>
