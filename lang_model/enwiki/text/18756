</ref>) are female [[model (person)|model]]s who appear in [[hip-hop]]-oriented [[music video]]s and related [[men's magazines]], calendars, award shows, [[beauty pageants]], or live performances. Many video models are aspiring actors, singers, dancers, or professional models. Their reasons for appearing in rap videos can vary, with most hip hop models hoping to gain commercial exposure and make a living. Other video models work for free and have a brief moment in the limelight.<ref>Sharpley-Whiting, T. Denean.

==Social aspect==

The work of hip hop models and their portrayal in music videos have drawn criticism. Critics suggest that music-video models are typically placed in [[subordinate]] and [[submissive]] roles while male artists are shown in positions of power.<ref>Conrad, Kate; Travis Dixon; Yuanyuan Zhang (2009).

In the rap world, women represent success, and they are treated almost as accessories: a means for rappers to prove that they have made it to the top. It is not that rappers feel that women are inferior, but they feel treating women like a collector<U+2019>s item is how they should go about displaying their new-found success.<ref>Albert, Brandon. "Hip-Hop: The False Advertisement of Women" The Ohio State University, 2009. </ref> 

Hip-hop models, also defined as video vixens, used their bodies to sell an ideal or fake notion of beauty. The ideal of beauty is associated with lighter skin, longer hair, and having a body that men fantasize over. It was this portrayal of black beauty that continues to spark controversy in today's mainstream hip-hop music. 

In 2004, [[Nelly]]'s video for his song "[[Tip Drill (song)|Tip Drill]]" came under particular criticism for its depiction and sexual objectification of women.<ref name="Nelly">Bailey, Moya (May 24, 2004).

The image of the Video Vixen can be witnessed being coy, dancing, stripping or being sexually suggestive in videos of all genres, her position however, within hip-hop culture and discourse places her in a peculiar place.<ref>Story, Kaila A.

=== The jezebel ===
The jezebel is a stereotype that depicts the modern day video vixen. Jezebel is a stereotype that is often used to describe the oversexualized Black woman. Black jezebel is the bad female who is promiscuous, the embodiment of lust. she uses her sexually exhausted, chaste or truthful.   The jezebel is the promiscuous female with an insatiable sexual appetite.<ref>http://racism.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1277:aawomen01a&catid=72&Itemid=215</ref> Referred to as "hoochies" "freaks" "hoodrats" or "chickenheads" contemporary Jezebels can be found jiggling and gyrating in hip-hop music videos. [[Misogyny]] and objectification neither originated in, or is it endemic to hip-hop, but the glorification of the degradation of Black women has become pervasive in hip-hop culture.<ref>Oliver, Chyann L.

== Video vixens in hip hop culture ==
There is no question that the Video Vixen image has become a staple and a nuanced form of sex work within Black popular music; especially within the genre of hip-hop.<ref>Story, Kaila A.
