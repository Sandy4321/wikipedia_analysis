'''Hurricane Felicia''' was the strongest [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[2009 Pacific hurricane season]] and the strongest in the eastern Pacific since [[Hurricane Daniel (2006)|Hurricane Daniel]] in [[2006 Pacific hurricane season|2006]].<ref name="HURDAT">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center Hurricane Research Division|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|year=2009|accessdate=August 5, 2009|title=Eastern Pacific HURDAT tracks, 1949-2008|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2008_epa.txt}}</ref><ref name="RBT">{{cite web|publisher=[[United States Naval Research Laboratory]]|year=2009|accessdate=August 5, 2009|title=Preliminary Best Track for Hurricane 08E (Felicia)|url=http://199.9.2.143/tcdat/tc09/EPAC/08E.FELICIA/trackfile.txt}}</ref> Forming on August&nbsp;3 as Tropical Depression Eight-E, the system quickly developed deep [[Atmospheric convection|convection]]. By the following morning, the depression became a tropical storm, receiving the name Felicia. Throughout the day, the storm [[Rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]], attaining hurricane status early on August&nbsp;4. By the afternoon, the storm featured a well-defined [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]] and further intensified into a major hurricane. During the evening hours, the storm further intensified into a [[SSHS#Category 4|Category 4 hurricane]]. Several hours later, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 145&nbsp;mph (230&nbsp;km/h) and a [[barometric pressure]] of 935&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 27.61&nbsp;inHg). After reaching this strength, the hurricane gradually weakened as it tracked generally towards the northwest. By August&nbsp;8, Felicia weakened to a Category 1 hurricane and later a tropical storm on August&nbsp;9. The following day, the storm turned nearly due west towards Hawaii, continuing to lose strength. On August&nbsp;11, Felicia weakened to a tropical depression and quickly degenerated into a remnant low before passing over the islands.

After weakening into a remnant low, Felicia continued to approach the Hawaiian Islands and on August&nbsp;12, the system produced copious amounts of rainfall across several islands. The highest total was recorded on [[Oahu]] at nearly {{convert|9|in|mm|abbr=on}}, causing isolated mudslides and flooding. In [[Maui]], the heavy rains helped to alleviate drought conditions and water shortages, significantly increasing the total water across the island's reservoirs and river flooding resulted in the closure of one school. Large swells produced by the storm resulted in several lifeguard rescues at several island beaches. In all, only minor impacts were caused by the remnants of Felicia.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Felicia 2009 track.png}}
Late August&nbsp;2, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) began monitoring a [[tropical wave]] producing showers and thunderstorms roughly 1,000&nbsp;miles (1,610&nbsp;km) southwest of the southern tip of [[Baja California Sur|Baja California]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Brennan|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=August 2, 2009|accessdate=August 5, 2009|title=Tropical Weather Outlook|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-P/2009080305.ABPZ20}}</ref> The storm gradually became better organized as it tracked generally towards the west.<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Pasch and Dave Roberts|date=August 2, 2009|accessdate=August 5, 2009|title=Tropical Weather Outlook|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-P/2009080311.ABPZ20}}</ref> By August&nbsp;3, the system became increasingly organized<ref>{{cite web|author=Jessica Schauer Clark and Michael Brennan|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=August 3, 2009|accessdate=August 5, 2009|title=Tropical Weather Outlook|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-P/2009080323.ABPZ20}}</ref> and around 8:00&nbsp;pm [[Pacific daylight time|PDT]] (0300&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] August&nbsp;4), the NHC designated the system as Tropical Depression Eight-E.<ref name="PA1">{{cite web|author=Michael Brennan|publisher=National hurricane Center|date=August 3, 2009|accessdate=August 5, 2009|title=Tropical Depression Eight-E Public Advisory One|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2009/ep08/ep082009.public.001.shtml?}}</ref> [[Atmospheric convection|Convective banding features]] and poleward [[Outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] were being enhanced by the nearby [[2009 Pacific hurricane season#Tropical Storm Enrique|Tropical Storm Enrique]].
