'''''Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures''''' is an online [[virtual world]] based on the animated television series [[Star Wars]]: [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]. Players create and customize in-world avatars and can participate in a variety of Clone Wars themed [[mini-game]]s and activities, earning Republic credits to purchase new weapons, outfits, ships, and furniture.

''Clone Wars Adventures'' is free to download and play, but only those that have a paid membership get access to a majority of the game's features. Additionally, many outfits and premium items can only be purchased with Station Cash, a form of in game currency that players need to purchase with real money instead of in game credits.

Generally, the game is updated with new content from each new episode of the television show the night that the episode airs or just about every Friday. 

The game follows a similar business model to the popular SOE MMO, ''[[Free Realms]]''. However, unlike ''Free Realms,'' the game was released at retail, though the game is free-to-play.<ref name="Announcement">{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5552522/free-realms-meets-star-wars-in-clones-wars-adventures |title=Free Realms Meets Star Wars In Clones Wars Adventures |author=Mike Fahey |date=June 1, 2010 |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}</ref>

Each card comes with 1000 Station Cash and grants one of four parts of a costume including a Jet Pack trooper, Kit Fisto costume, and Anakin Skywalker robes. Rarely, SOE will announce days when players can receive double or even triple Station Cash. Players can also buy game Credits with Station Cash. 

Jedi Members are given access to VIP areas, ability to wield dual-lightsabers, member-only items, and a special deluxe house. Members are also allowed access to more mini-games and extra game content.

==Environment==
The in-game world of ''Clone Wars Adventures'' is set in the [[Jedi Temple]] on [[Coruscant]]. Here players can interact with popular Clone Wars characters like [[Anakin Skywalker]], Commander Cody, Captain Rex, and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], and play more than 30 different [[mini-game]]s including Lightsaber Duel, Republic Defender, a tower defense game, and Speeder Bike Racing. Other mini-games are campaign based on Seasons 3 and 4 from Star Wars the Clone Wars. Players can challenge each other in multi-player games to win Credits. Even though the game is based on the Jedi temple, players can travel to different planets like Ryloth, Umbara, and Mon Calamari when going to the hangar bay. 

When exploring the different areas of the temple, players will often find blue or gold spheres that give free Credits when clicked on. The blue spheres give the player 25 Credits and the gold, which are relatively rare, give 100 Credits. Clone Wars Adventures also has daily mini-games that are played once a day, but can reward huge amounts of credits. These games include a Daily Spin, Daily Holocron, and Clone Wars Trivia.

Sony Online Entertainment adds new game content every week, such as new costumes, furniture, or pets. Sometimes, whole new games will appear including campaign mini-games like Mission to Iceberg Three or Geonosis Saga. Games with campaigns will often have a title or pet that will be granted to the player upon completion of the entire campaign.

There have been about 80 updates on Clone Wars Adventures, each occurring every Friday, with one of the largest ones being the Umbaran Battle Zone, which allows players to freely roam miles of virtual game space and finally have the opportunity to start collections, quests, or even just play the new Umbaran missions themselves. The battle zone also lets players purchase weapons and droids that will grant them power-ups and heavy firepower when battling the AI droids or Umbarans. An ancient Sith Temple has been added to Umbara, in which players could enter with a Sith Holocron. Once inside, they fight their way through many acolytes and work to reach some of the most dangerous and sinister villains of the game, Darth Maul and Savage Oppress. 

In addition to the Umbaran collections and missions, players have been given the opportunity to try and complete all the challenges for each Umbaran mission. If players dare to accomplish such a feat, they will receive a legendary title that reads ",Hero of Umbara" after their name, as well as a large Umbaran trophy to place in their home and show off to their friends. As a bonus, players will also receive a rather small sum of extra credits for completing this heroic quest.

==Combat Zones==

Umbara - Regarded as one of the largest updates in Clone Wars Adventures, the new Battle of Umbara combat zone offers both members and padawans a new way to explore, start collections, and battle. The combat zone started off with one collection for players to begin, and one mini-game - Airfield Mission. After a month, the zone was updated with new secret bunker missions, landing zones for drop ships, a Sith Academy mission, which provides an opportunity for players to battle the sinister Darth Maul and Savage Oppress, and even an albino rancor hunting mission. The combat zone also allows players to put their powerful weapons to the test, and offers a new way o travel within the zone using speeder, or walker mounts. The battle zone currently offers five exclusive mini-games, several collections, and two exclusive titles for players to earn.

Carlac - Coming soon to Clone Wars Adventures, the snow-covered world of Carlac is located in the outer rim. It will also be a set location for a series of episodes in Star Wars The Clone Wars Season 5, allowing players to fight against the dreadful, and dangerous Death Watch organization.

Ryloth - Ryloth is considered more a tutorial zone than a combat zone. However it does allow players to battle droids and earn credits upon their defeat, but offers no campaigns, collections, or exclusive titles.

==Crates and Codes==
SOE conducted another recent update which allows players to collect crates everyday. The player will receive only one crate a day when winning any game, but also can collect another one by beating their high score in that game. If the player has SC, they can purchase an "Access Code" which will give the player the ability to open one of their crates.

What is inside each crate remains a secret until it is revealed when the player opens the crate. The crates can be common SC items like building materials, SC furniture, or rare red rancor pet. Even rarer items include a red rancor, speeders, expensive SC costumes, and more. What are in the crates can be just about any SC item or items in the game.

Each crate costs 200 SC, but can be purchased for 100 SC if it is on sale that day for a 50% discount.

==Player Housing==
All players are given their own personal house in game. Free players are provided a Felucian Starter Lot, while members are given the larger and more customizable [[Jedi]] Living Quarters in addition to the lot. Add on rooms like the Droid Destruction Chamber or the Hidden Armory can be purchased with Station Cash. 

Additional player houses can be purchased with Station Cash as well, like the Attack Cruiser house that gives the player access to their own Republic battleship, and a Mustafar Lot which allows players to customize their house on a volcano surrounded by rivers of lava. Each of these houses has its own set of furniture appropriate for its environment such as Cruiser sets and Mustafar furniture. Other lots include Ryloth, Orto Plutonia, Kamino, Mustafar, Asteroid, Umbaran, and other Lots.

Players can customize their houses with furniture and other decorations.
Other players are allowed to rate each others houses. Some furniture sets can only be unlocked by buying Card Commander packs and winning certain mini-games. Other mini-games reward the players a virtual trophy after successfully completing a level or by performing certain tricks in the game. Some trophies can be placed in the player's house while others are auto-placed in their trophy room.

Non-Members are allowed one set of housing items based on lower city furniture, while Jedi members are given access to purchase over 30 different sets of furniture including regular furniture, turrets, and building materials using game Credits or Station Cash. Players are still allowed access to these even when their membership ends, but only if they still have them in their furniture storage. Station Cash furniture sets include Gungan furniture, Mon Calamari aquatic furniture, and special turrets such as the ARC Trooper Turret.
A few items can perform actions when clicked on by the player like turning on lights or party disco balls.

Sony allows players to buy promotional items like tree lights, face masks, and sparklers on special Holidays such as Halloween, Valentine's Day, and Christmas (known in Star Wars as "[[The Star Wars Holiday Special|Life Day]]").

With the recent games updates, players can now purchase SC or Republic Credit "Guests" to place in their houses. The guests include aliens, droids, or Force forms which can be placed in a house and clicked on and cause the guest to perform the special action that would be performed in a holo-projector.

==Squads==
Clone Wars offers Jedi Members to create squads as a way to talk to a large group of people, set up an organization, or just to get to know people. Special squads including ones that are created by Emissaries or CWA Counselors are strictly off-limits to any player. Players can also create squads that focus only of specific people groups like Clone Troopers, Jedi, Sith, Bounty Hunters, etc.

When creating a squad, the player will be required to name the squad and submit it for approval by a Moderator. A notice will be sent to the squad create when their squad has been created so they may begin to recruit players. All squads have a limit of 100 members and are each given their own private chat that is only visible to squad members. 

Upon recruiting players to the squad, the leader or leaders have the option to promote members. Only Jedi Members can be promoted; Padawans cannot. The player is given the choice on how high to promote the member. They are also given the ability to demote any member.

Promotions:
* Leader - The player has total power in the group. They can delete the squad, add or remove members, promote members to both commander and general.
* General - In addition to Commander, players can add or remove members and promote them to Commander. Can also change daily squad message.
* Commander - In addition to Trooper, players can add members to the squad and change the daily squad message.
* Trooper - Players can chat in the private squad chat and take party in special squad events. Padawans will remain this rank until they become a Jedi Member and get promoted. Their squad name will be displayed below their character name.

Players can only be in one squad at a time, but may decide to leave if they want to further explore different squads.

If a player ever creates a hate group or slave-trading squad, their account could be suspended or even banned from CWA, since it violates the rules of conduct for squads on Clone Wars Adventures.

==Companions==
Players can purchase droid companions like [[R2-D2]] or TO-DO to follow them around in game. There are also special attachments that allow pets to do new things, like a boombox to make other players dance, or mounted guns to fire lasers when clicked on. Players can unlock more droids by entering special game codes by purchasing Clone Wars Trading Cards or McDonald's Happy Meals. Other companions include adopted creatures such as the Jawa.

There are several Creature Pets available such as the Convor, a bird-like creature, with helmet attachments available for purchase. Other creatures include an Anooba, Kowakian Monkey-Lizard, a brown rancor, and a red rancor, which can only be obtained when receiving the pet in a special crate by purchasing a SC Code to open it.

Somedays, the game will have a pet and its parts or equipment in a bundle lot for a discounted SC price. Players can save a lot of money when purchasing bundles, especially if it is a pet that can only be obtained in a special holiday.

==Development==
''Clone Wars Adventures'' was developed by Sony Online Entertainment, the developers of well received [[massively multiplayer online game|massively multiplayer online]] [[role-playing video game|role playing]] [[video game]], [[Free Realms]]. It was announced at [[E3 2010]], and is based on the animated television series [[Star Wars]]: [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]].

The game was designed with young fans of the television show in mind. In an effort to support online safety for children, strict filters only allow pre-approved words to be shown in chat, restricting the ability of a player to communicate personal information to others in game or to use bad language. The chat filter also blocks out numbers or numerals to prevent the use of further personal information or private codes.<ref name="Gamezebo">http://www.gamezebo.com/news/2010/06/02/star-wars-clone-wars-adventures-online-game-announced</ref>
