Divided into three subdivisions of the former [[Soviet Union]], the valley is ethnically diverse, and in the early 21st century was the scene of ethnic conflict.  A large triangular valley in what is an often dry part of Central Asia, the Fergana owes its fertility to two rivers, the [[Naryn River|Naryn]] and the [[Kara Darya]], which run from the east, joining near [[Namangan]], forming the [[Syr Darya river]]. The valley's history stretches back over 2300 years, when its population was conquered by [[Greco-Bactrian]] invaders from the west.  Chinese chroniclers date its towns to more than 2100 years ago, as a path between Greek, Chinese, [[Bactria]]n and [[Parthia]]n civilizations. It was home to [[Babur]], founder of the [[Mughal Dynasty]], tying the region to modern [[Afghanistan]] and South Asia.  The [[Russian Empire]] conquered the valley at the end of the 19th century, and it became part of the Soviet Union from the beginning of the 20th. Its three soviet regional states gained independence in 1991.  The area remains [[Muslim]], populated by ethnically [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]], [[Tajik people|Tajik]]s,  and [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], often intermixed and not matching modern borders.  As well there historically have been substantial [[Russians|Russian]], [[Kashgar]]ians, [[Kipchaks]], [[Bukharan Jews]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] minorities.  Mass cotton cultivation, introduced by the Soviets, remains central to the economy, along with a wide range of grains, fruits and vegetables.  There is a long history of stock breeding, leatherwork, and a growing mining sector, including deposits of [[coal]], [[iron]], [[sulfur]], [[gypsum]], [[rock-salt]], [[lacustrine salt]], [[naphtha]], and some small known oil reserves.

==Geography and geology==

The Fergana valley is an intermountain depression in Central Asia, between the mountain systems of the Tien-Shan in the north and the Gissar-Alai in the south. The valley is approximately 300&nbsp;km long and up to 70&nbsp;km wide, forming an area of 22,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Its position makes it a separate geographic zone.<ref>[http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/topography-and-hydrography-of-the-ferghana-valley grida.no]: topography and hydrography of the ferghana valley.</ref>  The valley owes its fertility to two rivers, the [[Naryn River|Naryn]] and the [[Kara Darya]], which unite in the valley, near [[Namangan]], to form the [[Syr Darya]]. Numerous other tributaries of these rivers exist in the valley including the [[Sokh River]]. The streams, and their numerous mountain effluents, not only supply water for irrigation, but also bring down vast quantities of sand, which is deposited alongside their courses, more especially alongside the Syr Darya where it cuts its way through the [[Khujand]]-[[Ajar, Tajikistan|Ajar]] ridge, forming there the [[Karakchikum]]. This expanse of [[moving sands]], covering an area of 750&nbsp;mi<U+00B2>, under the influence of south-west winds, encroaches upon the agricultural districts.

The central part of the [[geological depression]] that forms the valley is characterized by block [[subsidence]], originally to depths estimated at 6-{{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}}, largely filled with [[sediments]] that range in age as far as the [[Permian<U+2013>Triassic extinction event|Permian-Triassic boundary]]. Some of the sediments are marine carbonates and [[clay]]s. The [[Fault (geology)|fault]]s are upthrusts and overthrusts. [[Anticline]]s associated with these faults form traps for [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]], which has been discovered in 52 small [[oil field|fields]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20091027103235/http://geocities.com/internetgeology/L34.html ]</ref>

==Climate==
The climate of this valley is dry and warm. In March the temperature reaches 20&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (68&nbsp;<U+00B0>F), and then rapidly rises to 35&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (95&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) in June, July and August. During the five months following April precipitation is rare, but increases in frequency starting in October. Snow and frost, down to -20&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (-4&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) occur in December and January.

==History==
{{History of Tajikistan}}

===Achaemenid Empire===
As early as 500 BCE, the western sections of the Fergana valley formed part of the [[Sogdiana]] region, which was ruled from further west and owed fealty to the [[Achaemenid Empire]] at the time of [[Darius the Great]]. The independent and warlike Sogdiana<ref>Independent Sogdiana: Lane Fox (1973, 1986:533) notes [[Quintus Curtius]], vi.3.9: with no satrap to rule them, they were under the command of [[Bessus]] at [[Gaugamela]], according to [[Arrian]], iii.8.3.</ref> formed a border region insulating the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persians]] from the nomadic [[Scythians]] to the north and east.<ref>"The province of Sogdia was to Asia what Macedonia was to Greece: a buffer between a brittle civilization and the restless barbarians beyond, whether the Scyths of Alexander's day and later or the [[White Huns]], Turks and Mongols who eventually poured south to wreck the thin veneer of Iranian society" ([[Robin Lane Fox]], ''Alexander the Great'' (1973) 1986:301).</ref> The [[Siege of the Sogdian Rock|Sogdian Rock]] or Rock of Ariamazes, a fortress in Sogdiana, was captured in 327 BC by the forces of [[Alexander the Great]]; after an extended campaign putting down Sogdian resistance and founding military outposts manned by his Greek veterans, Alexander united Sogdiana with [[Bactria]] into one [[satrap]]y.

===Hellenistic settlement===
{{main|Dayuan}}
[[File:UrumqiWarrior.jpg|thumb|120px|Probable Greek soldier in the [[Sampul tapestry]], woolen wall hanging, 3rd-2nd century BCE, Sampul, [[Urumqi]] [[Xinjiang]] Museum.]] In 329 BCE, [[Alexander the Great]] founded a Greek settlement with the city of [[Alexandria Eschate]] "The Furthest", in the southwestern part of the Ferghana valley, on the southern bank of the river [[Syr Darya]] (ancient Jaxartes), at the location of the modern city of [[Khujand]], in the state of [[Tajikistan]]. It was later ruled by [[Seleucids]] before secession of Bactria.

After 250 BCE, the city probably remained in contact with the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] centered on [[Bactria]], especially when the Greco-Bactrian king [[Euthydemus I|Euthydemus]] extended his control to Sogdiana. There are indications that from [[Alexandria Eschate]] the Greco-Bactrians may have led expeditions as far as [[Kashgar]] and [[<U+00DC>r<U+00FC>mqi]] in [[Xinjiang|Chinese Turkestan]], leading to the first known contacts between China and the West around 220 BCE. Several statuettes and representations of Greek soldiers have been found north of the [[Tien Shan]], on the doorstep to China, and are today on display in the [[Xinjiang]] museum at [[Urumqi]] (Boardman). Of the Greco-Bactrians, the Greek historian [[Strabo]] too writes that:
{{bquote|they extended their empire even as far as the [[Seres]] (Chinese) and the [[Phryni]].<ref>[[Strabo]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+11.11.1 XI.XI.I]</ref>}}

The Fergana area, called [[Dayuan]] by the Chinese, remained an integral part of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] until after the time of [[Demetrius I of Bactria]] (c. 120 BCE), when confronted with invasions by the [[Yuezhi]] from the east and the [[Sakas]] [[Scythians]] from the south. After 155 BCE, the Yuezhi were pushed into Fergana by neighbors from the north and east. The Yuezhi invaded urban civilization of the [[Dayuan]] in Ferghana, eventually settling on the northern bank of the [[Oxus]], in the region of [[Transoxiana]], in modern-day [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]], just north of the Hellenistic [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]].  The Greek city of [[Alexandria on the Oxus]] was apparently burnt to the ground by the Yuezhi around 145 BCE.<ref>Bernard, P. (1994a): "Alexander and his successors in Central Asia." In: ''History of civilizations of Central Asia, Volume II. The development of sedentary and nomadic civilizations: 700 B.C. to A.D. 250'', pp. 88<U+2013>97. Harmatta, J<U+00E1>nos, ed., 1994. Paris: UNESCO Publishing.</ref>  Pushed by these twin forces, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom reoriented itself around lands in what is now Afghanistan, while the new invaders were partially assimilated into the Hellenistic culture left in Ferghana valley.

===Interaction with China===
In the history of the [[Han Dynasty]], based on the travels of [[Zhang Qian]] about 126 BCE, the region of Ferghana is presented as the country of the [[Dayuan]] (Ta-Yuan), possibly descendants of the Greeks colonists (Da Yuan might be a transliteration of "Great Ionians"). Dayuan was renowned for its [[Fergana horse|''Heavenly Horses'']] which the Chinese tried to obtain with little success until they waged war against them in 104 BCE. 

The Dayuan were identified by the Chinese as unusual in features, with a sophisticated urban civilization, similar to that of the [[Bactrians]] and [[Parthians]]: "The Son of Heaven on hearing all this reasoned thus: Ferghana (Dayuan) and the possessions of Bactria and Parthia are large countries, full of rare things, with a population living in fixed abodes and given to occupations somewhat identical with those of the Chinese people, but with weak armies, and placing great value on the rich produce of China" (''[[Hou Han Shu]]'').

Agricultural activities of the Dayuan reported by Zhang Qian included growing of grain and grapes (for wine).<ref>[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18006 ''Silk Road, North China'', C. Michael Hogan, the Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham]</ref>  The area of Ferghana was thus the theater of the first major interaction between an urbanized culture speaking [[Indo-European languages]] and the Chinese civilization, which led to the opening up the [[Silk Road]] from the 1st century BCE.

===Bactrian rule===
[[File:BactriaMap.jpg|thumb|350px|Ancient cities of [[Bactria]]. Ferghana, to the top right, formed a periphery to these less powerful cities and states.]]
Fergana, on the route to the Chinese [[Tarim Basin]] from the west, remained at the boundaries of a number of classical era empires. The [[Kushan Empire]] formed from the same Yuezhi who had conquered the Hellenistic Fergana.  The Kushan spread out in the 1st century CE from Yuezhi confederation in the territories of ancient [[Bactria]] on either side of the middle course of the [[Oxus River]] or [[Amu Darya]] in what is now northern Afghanistan, and southern [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Through the Jade Gate to Rome: A Study of the Silk Routes during the Later Han Dynasty, First to Second Centuries CE|year=2009|first=John E.|last=Hill|publisher=BookSurge|isbn=978-1-4392-2134-1}} pp. 29, 318<U+2013>350</ref> The Kushan conquered most of what is now northern India and Pakistan, driving east through Fergana into the Tarim Basin against the Chinese. Kushan power also consolidated long distance trade, linking Central Asia to both [[Han Dynasty]] China and the [[Roman Empire]] in Europe.  The Kushans ruled the area as part of their larger empire until the 3rd century CE, when the [[Zoroastrian]] [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Sassanid Empire]] invaded Kushan territory from the southwest. Fergana remained under shifting local and Transoxian rulers thereafter. For periods in the 4th and 5th centuries, the Sassanid Empire directly controlled Transoxiana and Fergana, led by the conquests of [[Shapur II]] and [[Khosrau I]] against the Kushans and the [[Hephthalite Empire]]. Sassanid rule of Fergana was interrupted by Hepthalites and was ended by [[Gokturks]] in mid of 6th century. Gokturks ruled it until first quarter of 8th century except Chinese rule between 659 and 681.

===Islamic influence===

During the 8th century, Ferghana was the location of fierce rivalry between the [[Tang Dynasty]] of China and the expansion of Muslim power, leading to the [[Battle of Talas]] in 751, which marked the victory of Islam and the disengagement of China from Central Asia. Two antecedent battles in 715 and 717 had seen the Chinese to prevail over Arab forces.<ref>Shouyi Bai et al. (2003). ''A History of Chinese Muslim'' (Vol.2). Beijing: Zhonghua Book Company.

===Samanid, Karakhanid and Khwarezmid rules===
{{Main|Samanid Empire}}
The [[Samanid Empire]], rising from the [[Islamic conquest of Iran|Arab Muslim conquest of Persia]], pushed into what was then called [[Greater Khorasan]], including [[Transoxiana]] and the Fergana Valley from the West. In 819 CE, [[Ahmad ibn Asad]]<U+2014>son of [[Asad ibn Saman]]<U+2014>was granted authority over the city of Fergana by Caliph [[Al-Ma'mun|Al-Ma'mun's]] governor of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], Ghassan ibn 'Abbad, as a reward for his support against the rebel [[Rafi' ibn Laith]]. Following the death of his brother [[Nuh ibn Asad|Nuh]], who ruled in Samarkand, Ahmad and another brother [[Yahya ibn Asad|Yahya]] were given rule over the city by Abdallah, the governor of Khurasan. By the time of Ahmad's death in 864 or 865, he was the ruler of most of [[Transoxiana]], [[Bukhara]] and [[Khwarazm]]. Samarkand and Fergana went to his son, [[Nasr I of Samanid]], leading to a series of [[Samanid]] Dynasty Muslim rulers of the valley.

Eastern part of Fergana later was under suzerenaity of [[Kara-Khitan Khanate|Karakhitays]]. Karakhanid rule lasted till 1212, when [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmshahs]] conquered western part of it.

===Mongol-Turkic rule===
[[File:Babur idealisiert.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A portrait of [[Babur]], the [[Turco-Mongol]] founder of [[Mughal dynasty]], he was a native of [[Andijan]] in Ferghana Valley.]]
Mongol ruler [[Genghis Khan]] invaded Transoxiana and Fergana in 1219 during his conquest of [[Khwarazm]]. Before his death in 1227, he assigned the lands of Western Central Asia to his second son [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], and this region became known as the [[Chagatai Khanate]]. But it was not long before Transoxian Turkic leaders ruled the area, along with most of central Asia as fiefs from the [[Golden Horde]] of the Mongol Empire. The Fergana became part of a larger [[Turco-Mongol]] empire. This [[Mongols|Mongolian]] nomadic confederation known as [[Barlas]], were remnants of the original Mongol army of [[Genghis Khan]].<ref>''"Timur"'', The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2001-05 Columbia University Press, ([http://www.bartleby.com/65/ti/Timur.html LINK])</ref><ref>"Consolidation & expansion of the Indo-Timurids", in [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]], ([http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-26937/Islamic-world LINK])</ref> After the Mongol conquest of Central Asia, the Barlas settled in [[Turkistan]] (which then became also known as ''[[Moghulistan]]'' - "Land of Mongols") and intermingled to a considerable degree with the local [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Turkic languages|Turkic-speaking]] population, so that at the time of Timur's reign the Barlas had become thoroughly Turkicized in terms of language and habits.

The Fergana valley was ruled by a series of Muslim states in the medieval period. For much of this period local and southwestern rulers divided the valley into a series of small states. From the 16th century, the [[Shaybanid Dynasty]] of the [[Khanate of Bukhara]] ruled Fergana, replaced by the Janid Dynasty of Bukhara in 1599. In 1709 Shaybanid emir Shahrukh of the Minglar [[Uzbeks]] declared independence from the [[Khanate of Bukhara]], establishing a state in the eastern part of the Fergana Valley. He built a citadel to be his capital in the small town of [[Kokand]].  As the [[Khanate of Kokand]], Kokand was capital of a territory stretching over modern eastern [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]], southern [[Kazakhstan]] and whole of [[Kyrgyzstan]].

===Russian Empire===
[[File:KokandPalace.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Khan's Palace, Kokand.]]
'''Ferghana''', or '''Fergana''' was a province of [[Russian Turkestan]], formed in 1876 out of the former [[khanate of Kokand]] (see [[Kokand]]). It was bounded by the provinces of [[Syr-darya]] in the North and Northwest, [[Samarkand]] in the West, and [[Zhetysu]] in the Northeast, by [[Xinjiang|Chinese Turkestan]] ([[Kashgaria]]) in the East, and by [[Bukhara]] and Afghanistan in the South. Its southern limits, in the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]], were fixed by an Anglo-Russian commission in 1885, from [[Zorkul]] (Victoria Lake) to the Chinese frontier; and [[Khignan]], [[Rushon District|Roshan]] and [[Wakhan]] were assigned to [[Afghanistan]] in exchange for part of [[Darvaz (region)|Darvaz]] (on the left bank of the [[Panj]]), which was given to [[Bukhara]]. The area amounted to some {{convert|53000|km<U+00B2>|0|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|17600|km<U+00B2>|0|abbr=on}} are in the Pamirs. 

Not all the inhabitants of the area were happy with this state of affairs. In 1898 [[Muhammed Ali Khalfa]] proclaimed a [[jihad]] against the [[Russian Empire|Russians]]. However after about twenty Russians had been killed, Khalfa was captured and executed.When the [[1905 Revolution]] spread across the Russian Empire, some [[Jadid]]s were active in the Ferghana Valley. When the Tsarist regime extended the [[military draft]] to include [[Muslim]]s, this led to a revolt which was far more widespread than that of 1898, and which was not entirely suppressed by the time of the [[Russian Revolution]]. <ref>{{cite web|title=Uzbekhistan|url=http://www.hunmagyar.org/turan/uzbek/index.html|publisher=Hunmagyar|accessdate=12 June 2013}}</ref>

===The Soviet and post-Soviet periods===
In 1924 the new boundaries separating the [[Uzbek SSR]] and [[Kyrgyz SSR]] cut off the eastern end of the Ferghana Valley, as well as the slopes surrounding it. This was compounded in 1928 when the [[Tajik ASSR]] became a fully-fledged republic, and the area around [[Khujand]] was made a part of it. This blocked the valley's natural outlet and the routes to Samarkand and Bukhara, but none of these borders was of any great significance so long as Soviet rule lasted. The whole region was part of a single economy geared to cotton production on a massive scale, and the overarching political structures meant that crossing borders was not a problem. Since 1991 this has changed, for the worse. Uzbekistan regularly closes its borders with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, causing immense difficulties for trade and for those who live in the region. Travellers from Khujand to [[Dushanbe]], unable to take the route through Uzbekistan, have to cross a high mountain pass between the two cities instead, along a terrible road. Similarly communications between [[Bishkek]] and [[Osh]] pass through difficult mountainous country and are endangered by the attitude of President [[Islam Karimov]] of Uzbekistan. Ethnic tensions also flared at one stage, most notably in the town of Uzgen, near Osh, where were [[Osh riots (1990)|Uzbek-Kyrgyz riots in 1990]]. There has been no further ethnic violence, and things appeared to have quieted down for several years.<ref>Weisbrode, K. (2001) ''Central Eurasia -- Prize or Quicksand?'' Oxford University Press, pp 46-48.</ref> However, the valley is a religiously conservative region which was particularly hard-hit by President Karimov's secularization legislation in Uzbekistan, together with his decision to close the borders with Kyrgyzstan in 2003. This devastated the local economy by preventing the importation of cheap Chinese consumer goods. The deposition of Askar Akayev in Kyrgyzstan in April 2005, coupled with the arrest of a group of prominent local businessmen brought underlying tensions to a boil in the region around Andijan and [[Qorasuv]] during the [[May 2005 unrest in Uzbekistan]] in which hundreds of protestors were killed by troops. Violence started to pick up again in 2010 in Kyrgyz part of the valley, heated by ethnic tensions, worsening economic conditions due to the global economic crisis, and political conflict overousting of Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev in April 2010. In June 2010, about 200 people have been reported to be killed during clashes in [[Osh]] and [[Jalal-Abad]], and 2000 more were injured.<ref>http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=35071&Cr=Kyrgyz&Cr1=</ref> Between 100,000 and 300,000 refugees, predominantly of Uzbek ethnic origin, attempted to flee to Uzbekistan, causing a major humanitarian crisis.

==Agriculture==
[[File:Confluence of Naryn and Kara Darya NASA.jpg|thumb|250px|Confluence of Naryn and Kara Darya seen from space (false color). Many irrigated agricultural fields can be seen.]] 

In [[Tsarist]] times, out of some {{convert|3,000,000|acre|km2}} of cultivated land, about two thirds were under constant irrigation and the remaining third under partial irrigation. The soil was considered by the author of the 1911 ''Britannica'' article to be admirably cultivated, the principal crops having been cotton, [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[barley]], [[maize]], [[millet]], [[Alfalfa|lucerne]], [[tobacco]], vegetables and fruit. Gardening was conducted with a high degree of skill and success. Large numbers of horses, cattle and sheep were kept, and a good many camels are bred. Over {{convert|17000|acre|km2}} were planted with [[vine]]s, and some {{convert|350000|acre|km2}} were under [[cotton]]. Nearly {{convert|1,000,000|acre|km2}} were covered with forests. The government maintained a forestry farm at [[Marghelan]], from which 120,000 to 200,000 young trees were distributed free every year amongst the inhabitants of the province.

[[Silkworm]] breeding, formerly a prosperous industry, had decayed, despite the encouragement of a state farm at New Marghelan.

==Industry==
Coal, iron, sulfur, [[gypsum]], [[rock-salt]], [[lacustrine salt]] and [[naphtha]] are all known to exist, but only the last two have ever been extracted in significant quantities. In the late 19th century there were a few small oil-wells in Ferghana, but these no longer function. In the Tsarist period the only industrial enterprises were some seventy or eighty factories engaged in cotton cleaning. Leather, saddlery, paper and cutlery were the principal products of the domestic or cottage industries. This was not greatly added to in Soviet times, when industrialisation was concentrated in the cities of [[Samarkand]] and [[Bukhara]].

==Trade==
Historically the Ferghana Valley was an important staging-post on the [[Silk Road]] for goods and people traveling from China to the Middle East and Europe. After crossing the passes from [[Kashgar]] in Xinjiang, traders would have found welcome relief in the fertile abundance of Ferghana, as well as the possibility of purchasing further high-quality silk manufactured in [[Margilan]]. The most famous export from the region were the 'blood-sweating' ''Heavenly Horses'' which so captured the imagination of the Chinese during the Han dynasty, but in fact these were almost certainly bred on the Steppe, either west of [[Bukhara]] or North of [[Tashkent]], and merely brought to Ferghana for sale. In the 19th century, not surprisingly, a considerable trade carried on with Russia; raw cotton, raw [[silk]], tobacco, hides, sheepskins, fruit and cotton and leather goods were exported, and manufactured wares, textiles, [[tea]] and [[sugar]] were imported and in part re-exported to Kashgaria and Bokhara. The total trade of Ferghana reached an annual value of nearly <U+00A3>3,500,000 in 1911. Nowadays it suffers from the same depression that affects all trade that either originates in or has to pass through Uzbekistan. The only significant international export is cotton, although the Daewoo plant in Andizhan sends cars all over Uzbekistan.

==Transport==
[[File:Khujand.jpg|thumb|right|the [[Syr Darya river]] bridge at [[Khujand]], [[Tajikistan]], in the far west of the Fergana Valley.]] 
Until the late 19th century Ferghana, like everywhere else in Central Asia, was dependent on the camel, horse and donkey for transport, while roads were few and bad. The Russians built a ''trakt'' or post-road linking Andijan, Kokand, Margilan and [[Khujand]] with Samarkand and Tashkent in the early 1870s. A new impulse was given to trade by the extension (1898) of the [[Transcaspian railway]] into Ferghana as far as Andijan, and by the opening of the [[Orenburg]]-[[Tashkent]] or [[Trans-Aral Railway]] in (1906).

Until [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times and the construction of the [[Pamir Highway]] from [[Osh]] to [[Khorog]] in the 1920s the routes to Kashgaria and the Pamirs were mere bridle-paths over the mountains, crossing them by lofty [[mountain pass|passes]]. For instance, the passes of [[Kara-kazyk]], 4,389 m (14,400&nbsp;ft) and [[Tenghiz-bai]] 3,413 m (11,200&nbsp;ft), both passable all the year round, lead from Marghelan to [[Karateghin]] and the Pamirs, while [[Kashgar]] is reached via [[Osh]] and [[Gulcha]], and then over the passes of [[Terek-davan]], 3,720 m (12,205&nbsp;ft); (open all the year round), [[Taldyk]], 3,505 m  (11,500&nbsp;ft), [[Archat]], 3,536 m (11,600&nbsp;ft), and [[Shart-davan]], 4,267 m (14,000&nbsp;ft). Other passes leading out of the valley are the [[Jiptyk]], 3,798 m (12,460&nbsp;ft), S. of [[Kokand]]; the [[Isfairam]], 3,657 m (12,000&nbsp;ft), leading to the glen of the [[Vakhsh River|Surkhab]], and the [[Kavuk]], 3,962 m (13,000&nbsp;ft), across the Alai Mts.

==Historical demography==
The information contained in the 1911 Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica is particularly interesting on this point, as it gives the full information from the  1897 census, the only one held in the Russian Empire before 1917, and helps to illuminate a situation rendered obscure by the vagaries of Soviet Nationalities policy in the 1920s and 1930s. The population numbered 1,571,243 in 1897, and of that number 707,132 were women and 286,369 were urban. 

In 1906  it was estimated at 1,796,500. Two-thirds of the total were [[Sart]]s and [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]]. They lived mostly in the valley, while the mountain slopes above it were occupied by [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], partly [[nomad]]ic and pastoral, partly agricultural and settled. The other nations were [[Kashgarians]], [[Kipchaks]], [[Bukharan Jews]] and [[Romani people|Gypsies]]. The governing classes were of course Russians, who constituted also the merchants and industrial working class, such as it was. But the merchants of [[West Turkestan]] were called all over Central Asia ''Andijanis'', from the town of [[Andijan]] in Ferghana. The great mass of the population are Muslims (1,039,115 in 1897). 

The divisions revealed by the [[1897 census]], between a largely Tajik-speaking area around Khuhand, hill-regions populated by [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] and a settled, population in the main body of the valley, roughly reflect the borders as drawn after 1924. One exception is the town of Osh, which has a majority Uzbek population but ended up in [[Kyrgyzstan]]. 

The one significant element that is missing when looking at modern accounts of the region are the [[Sart]]s. This term was abolished by the Soviets as 'derogatory' after 1920, but in fact there was a clear distinction between long-settled, [[Persianisation|Persianised]] Turkic peoples, speaking a form of [[Karluks|Qarluq]] Turkic that is very close to [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], and those who called themselves [[Uzbeks]], who were a [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] tribe speaking a Turkic dialect much closer to [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], who arrived in the region with [[Shaibani Khan]] in the mid-16th century. That this difference existed and was felt in Ferghana is attested to in Timur Beisembiev's recent translation of the ''Life of Alimqul'' (London, 2003). 

There were very few Kipchak-Uzbeks in Ferghana, although they had at various times held political power in the region. In 1924 however, Soviet policy decreed that all settled Turks in Central Asia would henceforth be known as "Uzbeks", (although the language chosen for the new Republic was not Kipchak but Qarluq) and the Ferghana Valley is now seen as an Uzbek 'heartland'.

==Administrative divisions==
In 1911 the province was divided into five districts, the chief towns of which were [[Fergana]] ([[Fergana|New Marghelan]]), capital of the province (8,977 inhabitants in 1897), [[Andijan]] (49,682 in 1900), [[Kokand]] (86,704 in 1900), [[Namangan]] (61,906 in 1897), and [[Osh]] (37,397 in 1900); but [[Marghelan|Old Marghelan]] (42,855 in 1900) and [[Chust, Uzbekistan|Chust]] (13,686 in 1897) were also towns of importance. 

The Valley is now divided between [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]]. In Tajikistan it is part of Soghd Province or [[vilayat]], with the capital at [[Khujand]]. In Uzbekistan it is divided between the Namangan, Andijan and Fergana [[viloyati]], while in Kyrgyzstan it contains parts of [[Batken]], [[Jalal-abad]] and [[Osh]] oblasts, with Osh being the main town for the southern part of the country.

In Uzbekistan:
* [[Andijan]]
* [[Fergana]]
* [[Kokand]]
* [[Namangan]]

In Kyrgyzstan:
* [[Batken]]
* [[Osh]]
* [[Jalalabad, Kyrgyzstan|Jalal-Abad]]
