{{Iron Age}}

In [[archaeology]], the '''Iron Age''' is the prehistoric period in any area during which cutting tools and weapons were mainly made of [[iron]] or [[steel]]. The adoption of this material coincided with other changes in society, including differing agricultural practices, religious beliefs and artistic styles.

The Iron Age is the last principal period in the [[three-age system]] for classifying prehistoric societies, preceded by the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Stone Age]]. Its dates and context vary depending on the geographical region. The Iron Age in each area ends with the beginning of the historical period, i.e. the local production of ample written sources. Thus, for instance, the British Iron Age ends with the [[Roman Conquest of Britain|Roman Conquest]].

The term "Iron Age" was originally derived from the "[[Ages of Man]]", i.e. the ages of human existence on the Earth according to [[Classical mythology]]. While the earlier ages in this scheme are entirely mythical ("[[The Golden Age]]" and the "[[Silver Age]]"), the later [[Bronze Age]] and Iron Age of classical mythology preserve the memory of actual periods when the metals mentioned dominated human life.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Classically, the Iron Age is taken to begin in the 12th century [[Anno Domini|BC]] in the [[ancient Near East]],  [[History of India|ancient India]] (with the post-[[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] [[Vedic civilization]]), [[Greater Iran|ancient Iran]], and [[ancient Greece]] (with the [[Greek Dark Ages]]). In other regions of [[Europe]], it started much later. The Iron Age began in the 8th century BC in [[Halstatt culture|Central Europe]] and the 6th century BC in [[pre-Roman Iron Age|Northern Europe]]. Iron use, in [[smelting]] and forging for tools, appears in [[West Africa]] by 1200 BC, making it one of the first places for the birth of the Iron Age.<ref name="millermintz">Duncan E.

Hummel, Springer, 2004</ref> This iron, being in its native metallic state, required no smelting of ores.)

The Iron Age is divided into two subsections, Iron I and Iron II. Iron I (1200<U+2013>1000 BC) illustrates both continuity and discontinuity with the previous [[Late Bronze Age]]. There is no definitive cultural break between the thirteenth and twelfth century throughout the entire region, although certain new features in the hill country, [[Transjordan]] and coastal region may suggest the appearance of the [[Aramaean]] and [[Sea People]] groups. There is evidence, however, that shows strong continuity with Bronze Age culture, although as one moves later into Iron I the culture begins to diverge more significantly from that of the late second millennium.

The Iron Age is usually said to end in the [[Mediterranean]] with the onset of historical tradition during [[Hellenistic period|Hellenism]] and the [[Roman Empire]], in [[India]] with the onset of [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], in China with the onset of [[Confucianism]], and in Northern Europe with the [[early Middle Ages]].

The arrival of iron use in various areas is discussed in more detail below, broadly in chronological order.

==Iron use in the Bronze Age==
By the [[Middle Bronze Age]], increasing numbers of smelted iron objects (distinguishable from [[meteoric iron]] by the lack of nickel in the product) appeared throughout [[Anatolia]], [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indian subcontinent]], the Levant, the Mediterranean, and Egypt. Some sources suggest{{Who|date=October 2009}} that iron was being created in some places then as a byproduct of copper refining, as [[sponge iron]], and was not reproducible by the metallurgy of the time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The earliest systematic production and use of iron implements originates in Anatolia. African production of iron has been suggested to have begun at around the same time, and possibly even before Anatolia, but recent discoveries suggest that iron working appeared in Anatolia beginning around 2000 BC<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200903261611.htm Ironware piece unearthed from Turkey found to be oldest steel] in ''The Hindu'', Thursday, March 26, 2009</ref>. Recent archaeological research at [[Ganges]] Valley, India showed early iron working by 1800 BC.<ref name=Tewari/> By 1200 BC, iron was widely used in the [[Middle East]] but did not supplant the dominant use of [[bronze]] for some time.

==Transition from bronze to iron==
Bronze was previously used to make tools because its melting point is lower than that of iron. The Iron Age began with the development of higher temperature smelting techniques.  During the Iron Age, the best tools and weapons were made from steel, an alloy consisting of iron with a [[carbon]] content between 0.02% and 1.7% by weight. [[Steel]] weapons and tools were nearly the same weight as those of [[bronze]], but stronger. However, steel was difficult to produce with the methods available. Therefore, many Iron Age tools were fashioned of [[wrought iron]].<ref>[http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/h-carnegie-steel.htm A Brief History of Iron and Steel Production] by Professor Joseph S. Spoerl (Saint Anselm College)</ref> Wrought iron is weaker than bronze, but because it was less expensive, people used it anyway. Iron is by itself an adequately strong metal without additional alloys (although it could be further strengthened by [[case-hardening]] or [[forge welding]] small amounts of steel to areas subject to wear such as edges). Bronze, on the other hand, requires copper and tin, which are less common than iron.

Around 1800 BC, for reasons yet unknown to archaeologists, tin became scarce in the [[Levant]], causing a decline in bronze production. Copper, also, came to be in short supply. As a result, pirate groups around the Mediterranean, from around 1800<U+2013>1700 BC onward, began to attack fortified cities in search of bronze, to remelt into weaponry.

Bronze was much more abundant in the period before the 12th to 10th century, and Snodgrass<ref>A.M.Snodgrass (1967), "Arms and Armour of the Greeks". (Thames & Hudson, London)</ref><ref>A. M. Snodgrass (1971), "The Dark Age of Greece" (Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh).</ref> suggests that a shortage of tin, as a result of the [[Bronze Age collapse|trade disruptions]] in the Mediterranean at this time, forced peoples to seek an alternative to bronze. That many bronze items were recycled and made from implements into weapons during this time, is evidence of this.

==Transition to sovereign state==
During the Iron Age there was an abrupt transition from a [[tribe|tribal]] and [[clan]]-based society to a [[sovereign state]] [[form of government]] where [[de jure]] and [[de facto]] rights of individuals were replaced by [[sovereignty]] to the state.  Better availability of [[iron]] as a raw material allowed for new [[weapons]] development and large scale production. [[Military strategy]] like [[The Art of War]] and advancement in [[technology]] such as the [[chariot]] as an instrument of [[war]] allowed for massive [[invasion]], which resulted in [[territorial integrity]], which in turn could support a [[military]] and a [[money]] [[economy]]. These developments along with rapid [[technology transfer]] led to the emergence of the [[empire]]. During this time, [[matriarchy]] went into [[decline]], [[temples]] were destroyed, ancient [[civilizations]] were wiped out, and [[pantheism]] was replaced with [[monotheism]].

==Ancient Near East==
===Transition===
{{See|Bronze Age collapse}}
The Iron Age in the [[Ancient Near East]] is believed to have begun with the discovery of iron smelting and smithing techniques in [[Anatolia]] or the [[Caucasus]] and [[Balkans]] in the late [[2nd millennium BC]] (circa 1300 BC).<ref>Jane. C. Waldbaum (1978), "From Bronze to Iron. Vol. Studies in Mediterranean Archaeology" (LIV. Paul Astroms Forlag, Goteburg.)</ref> 

The use of iron weapons instead of bronze weapons spread rapidly throughout the [[Near East]] or the southwest [[Asia]] by the beginning of the 1st millennium BC. Anatolians had begun forging weapons out of iron, which was a superior metal to bronze, by 1500 BC at the latest.

The use of iron weapons by the [[Hittites]] was believed to have been a major factor in the rapid rise of the Hittite Empire.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Because the area in which iron technology first developed was near the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], the technology expanded into both Asia and Europe simultaneously,<ref>John Collis (1989), "The European Iron Age" (reprint ed. B. T. Batsford, London)</ref><ref>John Collis (1997), "The European Iron Age" (Routledge, ISBN 978-0415151399)</ref> aided by Hittite expansion. The [[Sea Peoples]] and the related [[Philistines]] are often associated with the introduction of iron technology into Asia, as are the [[Dorians]] with respect to [[Ancient Greece|Greece]].<ref>Leonard R.

The beginning of the 1st millennium BC saw extensive developments in iron metallurgy in India.

As early as 300 BC, certainly by AD 200, high quality steel was produced in southern India, by what would later be called the [[crucible steel|crucible technique]]. In this system, high-purity wrought iron, charcoal, and glass were mixed in crucible and heated until the iron melted and absorbed the carbon.<ref>Juleff, 1996</ref>

===Sri Lanka===
The protohistoric Early Iron Age in Sri Lanka lasted from 1000 to 600 BC. Radiocarbon evidence has been collected from [[Anuradhapura]] and Aligala shelter in [[Sigiriya]].<ref>Lahiru Weligamage (2002) The Ancient Sri Lanka</ref><ref>Deraniyagala 1992: 709-29</ref><ref>Karunaratne and Adikari 1994:58; Mogren 1994: 39</ref> The Anuradhapura settlement is recorded to extend 10 hectares by 800 B and grew to 50 hectares by 700 - 600 BC to become a town.<ref>Allchin 1989: 3</ref>  The skeletal remains of an [[Early Iron Age]] chief was excavated in Anaikoddai, [[Jaffna]].

==East Asia==
===China===
{{Main|Iron Age China}}
In 1972, near the city of [[Gaocheng]] (<U+85C1><U+57CE>) in [[Shijiazhuang]] (now [[Hebei]] province), an iron-bladed [[bronze]] [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] (<U+94C1><U+5203><U+9752><U+94DC><U+94BA>) dating back to the 14th century BC was excavated. After a scientific examination, the iron was shown to be made from [[meteor]]ic [[siderite]]. The Iron Age in East Asia began, however, when iron objects began to appear in present-day Xinjiang between the [[10th century BC]] and the [[7th century BC]], such as those found at the cemetery site of Chawuhukou.<ref name="Hall">Hall, Mark. ''Towards and Absolute Chronology for the Iron Age in Inner Asia''</ref>  This was soon followed by the development of iron metallurgy on the Manchurian plain by the [[9th century BC]].<ref name="Derevianko">Derevianki, A. P. 1973. ''Rannyi zheleznyi vek Priamuria''</ref>  Iron metallurgy reached the [[Yangzi River|Yangzi Valley]] toward the end of the [[6th century BC]].<ref name="Higham">Higham, Charles. 1996. ''The Bronze Age of Southeast Asia''</ref> The few objects were found at Changsha and Nanjing. The mortuary evidence suggests that the initial use of iron in Lingnan belongs to the mid to late [[Warring States]] period (from about 350 BC).

The techniques used in Lingnan are a combination of bivalve moulds of distinct southern tradition and the incorporation of piece mould technology from the ''Zhongyuan'' The products of the combination of these two periods are bells, vessels, weapons and ornaments and the sophisticated cast.

An Iron Age culture of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] has tentatively been associated with the [[Zhang Zhung culture]] described in early Tibetan writings.

{{Main|Yayoi period|Kofun period}}
The {{nihongo|'''Yayoi period'''|<U+5F25><U+751F><U+6642><U+4EE3>|''Yayoi-jidai''}} is an era in the [[history of Japan]] from about 500 BC to AD 300.<ref name="keally">[http://www.t-net.ne.jp/~keally/preh.html Prehistoric Archaeological Periods in Japan], Charles T. Keally</ref>  Distinguishing characteristics of the Yayoi period include the appearance of new pottery styles and the start of an intensive rice agriculture in paddy fields. The Yayoi followed the [[J<U+014D>mon period]] (14,000 BC to 500 BC) and Yayoi culture flourished in a geographic area from southern [[Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>]] to northern [[Honsh<U+016B>]].

The succeeding {{nihongo|'''Kofun period'''|<U+53E4><U+58B3><U+6642><U+4EE3>|''Kofun-jidai''}} lasts from around 250 to 538. The word ''kofun'' is Japanese for the type of [[tumulus|burial mound]]s dating from this era.  The Kofun and the subsequent [[Asuka period]]s are sometimes referred to collectively as the [[Yamato period]]. Iron items, such as tools, weapons, and decorative objects, are postulated to have entered Japan during this era or the late Yayoi period, most likely through contacts with the Korean Peninsula and China.

==Europe==
Iron working was introduced to Europe around 1000 BC, probably from [[Asia Minor]] and slowly spread northwards and westwards over the succeeding 500 years.

===Eastern Europe===
The early 1st millennium BC marks the Iron Age in Eastern Europe. In the [[Pontic steppe]] and the [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasus region]], the Iron Age begins with the [[Koban culture|Koban]] and the [[Novocherkassk culture|Chernogorovka and Novocherkassk]] cultures from ca. 900 BC. By 800 BC, it was spreading to [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt C]] via the alleged "[[Thraco-Cimmerian]]" migrations.

Along with Chernogorovka and Novocherkassk cultures, on the territory of ancient Russia and [[Ukraine]] the Iron Age is to a significant extent associated with [[Scythians]], who developed iron culture since the 7th century BC. The majority of remains of their iron producing and blacksmith's industries from 5th to 3rd century BC was found near [[Nikopol]] in [[Kamenskoe Gorodishche]], which is believed to be the specialized [[metallurgy|metallurgic]] region of the ancient [[Scythia]].<ref>[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd edition, entry on "<U+0416><U+0435><U+043B><U+0435><U+0437><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+0432><U+0435><U+043A>", available online [http://slovari.yandex.ru/art.xml?art=bse/00026/12300.htm here]</ref><ref>Christian, D. A History of Russia, Central Asia and Mongolia, [[Blackwell Publishing]], 1998, p. 141, available [http://books.google.com/books?id=YLQW5lUajgkC&vid=ISBN0631208143&dq=kamenskoe+scythian&q=kamenskoe online]</ref>

From the Hallstatt culture, the Iron Age spreads west with the [[Celt]]ic expansion from the 6th century BC. In Poland, the Iron Age reaches the late [[Lusatian culture]] in about the 6th century, followed in some areas by the [[Pomerania]]n culture.

The ethnic ascriptions of many Iron Age cultures has been bitterly contested, as the roots of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Balts|Baltic]] and [[Slavs|Slavic]] peoples were sought in this area.

===Central Europe===
In Central Europe, the Iron Age is generally divided in the early Iron Age [[Hallstatt culture]] (HaC and D, 800<U+2013>450) and the late Iron Age [[La T<U+00E8>ne culture]] (beginning in 450 BC). The Iron Age ends with the Roman Conquest.

===Italy===
{{See|Ancient peoples of Italy}}
In Italy, the Iron Age was probably introduced by the [[Villanovan culture]] but this culture is otherwise considered a Bronze Age culture, while the following [[Etruscan civilization]] is regarded as part of Iron Age proper. The Etruscan Iron Age was then ended with the rise and conquest of the [[Roman Republic]], which conquered the last Etruscan city of [[Velzna]] in [[265 BC]].

===British Isles===
{{Main|British Iron Age}}
In the [[British Isles]], the Iron Age lasted from about 800 BC<ref>Haselgrove, C. and Pope, R. (2007), 'Characterising the Earlier Iron Age', in C. Haselgrove and R. Pope (eds.), The Earlier Iron Age in Britain and the Near Continent. (Oxbow, Oxford)</ref> until the [[Roman Conquest of Britain|Roman Conquest]] and until the 5th century in non-Romanised parts. Structures dating from this time are often impressive, for example the [[broch]]s and [[dun]]s of northern [[Scotland]] and the [[hill fort]]s that dotted the [[island]]s.

===Northern Europe===
The Iron Age north of the Alps is divided into the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] and the [[Roman Iron Age]]. In Scandinavia, further prehistoric periods follow up to AD 1000: the [[Migration Period]], the [[Vendel Period|Vendel or Merovingian Period]] and the [[Viking Period]]. The earliest part of the Iron Age in Northern Germany and Denmark was dominated by the [[Jastorf culture]].

Early Scandinavian iron production typically involved the harvesting of [[bog iron]]. The Scandinavian peninsula, [[Finland]] and [[Estonia]] show sophisticated iron production from c. 500 BC. Metalworking and [[Asbestos-Ceramic]] pottery co-occur to some extent. Another iron ore used is was [[Black sand|iron sand]] (such as [[red soil]]). Its high phosphorus content can be identified in [[slag]]. Such slag is sometimes found together with [[asbestos ware]]-associated axe types belonging to the [[Ananjino Culture]].
