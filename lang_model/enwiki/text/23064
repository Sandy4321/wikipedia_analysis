The '''Cherry Poppin' Daddies''' are an American band established in [[Eugene, Oregon]] in 1989. Formed by [[Steve Perry (Oregon musician)|Steve Perry]] (vocals) and [[Dan Schmid]] (bass guitar), the band has experienced many membership changes over the years, with only Perry, Schmid and [[Dana Heitman]] (trumpet) currently remaining from the original line-up.

Initially conceived as an iconoclastic response to the [[grunge]] movement of the Pacific Northwest, the Daddies played an energetic fusion of [[punk rock|punk]], [[swing music|swing]] and [[ska]] set to colorful and flamboyant stage shows. While the core of the band's music has remained consistently rooted in ska and swing, their eclectic studio albums have since incorporated a wider variety of genres into their sound, most prominently [[funk rock]], [[rockabilly]], [[glam rock]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], [[country music|country]], [[worldbeat]], [[jazz]] and [[soul music|soul]].

After years of extensive touring within the [[third wave ska]] scene, the Daddies ultimately broke into the musical mainstream with their swing-based compilation album ''[[Zoot Suit Riot (album)|Zoot Suit Riot]]'' (1997). Released at the onset of the late 1990s [[swing revival]], ''Zoot Suit Riot'' went on to sell over two million copies in the United States while its [[Zoot Suit Riot (song)|eponymous single]] became a hit on [[modern rock]] radio, launching the Daddies to the forefront of the retro-swing genre, a perceived [[pigeonholing]] the band openly denounced in favor of their ska and punk influences. By the end of the decade, however, the Daddies' mainstream popularity declined with that of the swing revival's, and the resulting commercial failure of their ska-flavored follow-up ''[[Soul Caddy]]'' led to an abrupt [[Wikt:hiatus|hiatus]] in 2000.

The Daddies officially regrouped in 2002 to resume touring, independently recording and releasing their fifth studio album ''[[Susquehanna (album)|Susquehanna]]'' in 2008 before signing to indie label [[Rock Ridge Music]] in 2009 to release their most recent album, the ska compilation ''[[Skaboy JFK]]''.

==History==
=== Formation ===
[[Image:CherryPoppinDaddies89.JPG|left|250px|thumb|The original Cherry Poppin' Daddies line-up.]]
Following his high school graduation in 1981, [[Steve Perry (Oregon musician)|Steve Perry]] left his hometown of [[Binghamton, New York]] for [[Eugene, Oregon]] to pursue [[track and field athletics|track and field]] and a [[chemistry]] degree at the [[University of Oregon]].<ref name="Rocket">{{cite news |title=The Cherry Poppin' Daddies |author=Chandler, John |newspaper=''[[The Rocket (newspaper)|The Rocket]]'' |date=August 13, 1997}}</ref><ref name="PoppinUp">{{cite news |title=The Daddies Are Poppin' Up from the Underground |author=Siegle, Lisa |newspaper=[[The Register-Guard]] |date=March 15, 1991}}</ref> A [[punk rock]] fan since adolescence, Perry became engrossed in the Northwest hardcore scene pioneered by the likes of the [[Wipers]] and [[Poison Idea]], where he eventually met and befriended musician and fellow University student [[Dan Schmid]]. Sharing similar musical ambitions and a mutual disinterest in school, the pair agreed to drop out of college together and start a band, forming the punk trio The Jazz Greats in 1983, which evolved into a [[Paisley Underground]]-styled [[garage rock]] group called Saint Huck, who lasted from 1984 to 1987.<ref name="AllMusicBio">{{Cite web|author=Leahey, Andrew |title=Allmusic: Cherry Poppin' Daddies Bio |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p37881|pure_url=yes}} |work= |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=August 15, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Timeline">{{Cite web|author= |title=The Formative Years of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20021015034432/www.geocities.com/daddyworld2001/history.html |work= |publisher= |year=2001 |accessdate=December 14, 2009}}</ref>

As the rise of [[grunge]] began to phase punk and hardcore out of the Northwest underground by the late 1980s, Perry set out to start a band that stood in defiant contrast to the shoegazing attitude of [[alternative rock]], showcasing high energy dance music and [[Frank Zappa|Zappa]]-esque theatricality in an attempt to create something that an audience would react to viscerally instead of passively.<ref name="ColoScene">{{Cite web|author=Young, Quentin |title=Interview with Dan Schmid of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies |url= |work= |publisher=www.scenecolorado.com |date=c. 1998 |accessdate=March 31, 2010}}</ref><ref name="OregonLive">{{Cite web|author=Foyston, John |title=Cherry Poppin' Daddies |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010622062913/www.oregonlive.com/ent/music/9809/mu980909_daddies_rev.html |work= |publisher=[[The Oregonian]] |date=September 6, 1998 |accessdate=August 14, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Inland">{{cite news |title=Rockin' and Rollin' for a Good Cause |author=Cavendish, Jill |newspaper=''[[The Pacific Northwest Inlander]]'' |date=April 6, 1994 |url= }}</ref> Recruiting a [[horn section]] led by alto saxophonist [[Brooks Brown]], Perry and Schmid formed their latest band Mr. Wiggles - named after a [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] song - in November 1988.<ref name="Timeline" /><ref name="ColoScene" /><ref name="Lofi">{{cite journal |last=Kane |first=Laura |year=1998 |month= |title=Pop Your Cherry |journal=Lo-Fi Magazine}}</ref>

"My conception of punk", Perry told ''[[The Rocket (newspaper)|The Rocket]]'', "was doing whatever the hell you wanted as long as it had vitality and wasn't overly stupid...something exploratory and experimental", citing influence from genre-bending bands such as [[The Clash]] and the [[Meat Puppets]].<ref name="Rocket" /><ref name="Lofi" /> Though Mr. Wiggles was mostly grounded in [[funk]] music, Perry also drew heavily from an interest in [[jazz]], [[swing music|swing]] and [[rhythm and blues]], experimenting with combining jazz arrangements with punk rock in what he described as a "contemporary hybridization": aiming to modernize American roots music by infusing it with punk energy and using modernist, socially aware lyricism.<ref name="ColoScene" /><ref name="Canoe">{{Cite web|author=Bliss, Karen. |title=Cherry Poppin' Daddies Will Blow Your Mind |url= |work=Jam!

===Early years (1989-1993)===
By early 1989, the title of Mr. Wiggles had been renounced as the band switched to the intentionally risqu<U+00E9> "[[wikt:cherry-popper|Cherry Poppin']] Daddies".

Boasting a full horn section, a penchant for stage theatrics and encouraging their audiences to dance, the Daddies sought to prove themselves the antithesis to the then-current state of Northwest rock.<ref name="Rocket" /> As Perry said of the Daddies' ideology, "It was our way of saying 'screw you' [to alternative rock's 'fake' viewpoint]"..."we wanted to have fun, outrageously have a good blast without even thinking about it".<ref name="Miller1999">{{cite news |title=Daddies' Day |author=Miller, Bruce R. |newspaper=[[Sioux City Journal]] |date=April 9, 1999}}</ref><ref name="NWIMN">{{cite news |title=The Cherry Poppin' Daddies |author=Faux, Dave |newspaper=''Northwest Independent Music News'' |date=April 1994}}</ref> By the end of 1989, the Daddies had built a strong following within Oregon's [[counterculture]], frequently selling out shows and gathering critical acclaim, earning praise from ''[[Eugene Weekly]]'' as being the city's best band "by far".<ref name="EugenesBest">{{cite news |title=Eugene's Best |author=Glauber, Rich |newspaper=What's Happening ([[Eugene Weekly]]) |date=April 6, 1989}}</ref>

The Daddies recorded their first [[demo (music)|demo]] [[compact cassette|cassette]] ''4 From On High'' in July 1989, composed of four tracks of punk-swing and [[funk rock]]. The tape went on to sell over 1,000 copies in the Eugene and Portland areas<ref>{{cite news |title="Showcase" section |author= |newspaper=[[The Register-Guard]] |date=October 26, 1990}}</ref>, enabling the Daddies to self-produce their debut LP, ''[[Ferociously Stoned]]'', the following year.

====Eugene controversy====
In addition to their unusual mix of musical styles, the Daddies became perhaps most notorious for their extravagant and often provocative stage shows. With the band donning a rotating array of eccentric costumes, a typical Daddies performance would often feature [[Go-Go dancing|go-go dancers]], phallic stage scenery, prop-heavy [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]] skits and choreographed dance numbers.<ref name="EugenesBest" /><ref name="Baddest">{{cite news |title=The Baddest Daddy |author=Glauber, Rich |newspaper=What's Happening |year=1990}}</ref> Perry <U+2014> performing under the [[mad scientist]] stage persona of "MC Large Drink"<ref name="SKAb" /> <U+2014> would engage in absurdist [[shock rock]] antics such as mock [[crucifixion]], [[flag desecration|flag burning]], property destruction and wearing [[adult diaper]]s filled with food.<ref name="Baddest" /><ref name="OldBio">{{Cite web|author=Perry, Steve |title=Official Band Biography |url=http://www.daddies.com/  |work=www.daddies.com |publisher= |date=July 18, 2006 |accessdate=July 16, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060718112027/http://www.daddies.com/ |archivedate = July 18, 2006}}</ref><ref name="Frieman2009">{{Cite web|author=Frieman, Richie |title=Cherry Poppin' Daddies |work= |publisher=www.penseyeview.com |date=November 6, 2009 |accessdate=December 14, 2009}}</ref> The most infamous element of the Daddies' early stage show, however, was the "Dildorado" (alternately "Dildozer"), a heavily modified penis-shaped ride-on lawnmower that mimicked ejaculation by shooting salvos of colorful liquids from its tip.<ref name="OldBio" /><ref name="Kohnen2000">{{Cite web|author=Kohnen, John |title='The Infamous MotoPenis |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20001215080700/cyber-dyne.com/~jkohnen/dildozer.html |work= |publisher= |year=2000 |accessdate=2009-10-04}}</ref>

Almost immediately, the Daddies emerged a controversial presence within Eugene's actively political atmosphere. [[Feminism|Feminist]] and [[political correctness|P.C.]] groups condemned the band's performances as "pornographic", accusing their band name and sexually-charged lyricism as a promotion of [[misogyny]], [[sexual objectification]] and [[incest]], claims which Perry boldly defended as misinterpreted satire.<ref name="Baddest" /><ref name="Happen">{{cite news |title=Band Name Starts Controversy |author= |newspaper=What's Happening ([[Eugene Weekly]]) |date=April 13, 1989}}</ref><ref name="Complain">{{cite news |title=Name Misunderstood |author=Waldman, Rob |newspaper=[[The Register-Guard]] |date=February 1, 1990 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vG4VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=huoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4781,44608&dq=cherry+poppin+daddies |accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref> In what ''Eugene Weekly'' called "the most hotly discussed topic in the local music scene" and "the Eugene flash point for the growing national debate on censorship [and] free speech", the Daddies endured a storm of controversy which nearly ended their career.<ref name="Baddest" /> Vigilante protest groups would habitually tear down or deface the band's posters and led [[boycott]]s against venues that would book the group or even newspapers which gave them a positive review.<ref>{{cite news |title=Letters to the Editor - "Objectionable Band" |newspaper=[[The Register-Guard]] |date=March 24, 1991 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=63oVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3-sDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4874,5881500 |accessdate=August 7, 2010}}</ref> The Daddies' concerts regularly became the sites of organized [[picketing (protest)|picketing]] and, on one occasion, a [[bomb threat]].<ref name="Lofi" /><ref name="Baddest" /><ref name="SKAzaam">{{cite journal |last=Killen |first=Venus |year=1998 |month= |title=An Evening with the Cherry Poppin' Daddies |journal=SKAzaam}}</ref> The band members themselves were frequent recipients of [[hate mail]], threats and physical harassment: once, Perry claimed, an irate protester threw a cup of hot coffee in his face as he was walking down the street.<ref name="Inland" /><ref name="Lofi" />

===National touring and independent success (1994-1996)===

After numerous member changes including the departure of co-founder Brown and the addition of guitarist [[Jason Moss (musician)|Jason Moss]], the Daddies had progressed into a full-time touring band by early 1994. Now traveling coast-to-coast, the band was playing upwards of 200 shows a year, earning spots at festivals such as [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] in Austin, Texas and New York's [[CMJ Music Marathon]].<ref name="Michigan">{{Cite web|author=Harwin, Lise |title=Cherry Poppers Come Into Detroit |url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1996/oct/10-09-96/arts/art5.html  |work= |publisher=''[[Michigan Daily]]'' |date=October 9, 1996 |accessdate=August 11, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041015223650/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1996/oct/10-09-96/arts/art5.html |archivedate = October 15, 2004}}</ref><ref>Cherry Poppin' Daddies, ''Kids on the Street'' Press Kit, 1996.

While the mainstream's growing focus on punk and ska by the mid-1990s began presenting the Daddies with commercial opportunities - leading ''The Register-Guard'' to predict them as becoming the next Northwestern act "to go national"<ref>{{cite news |title=Arts & Entertainment > Listener's Guide |newspaper=''[[The Register-Guard]]'' |date=October 1, 1993 |accessdate=May 31, 2010}}</ref> - the band chose to remain wholly [[independent music|independent]] during this time to allow themselves unlimited creative freedom, supposedly after several major contract offers (including a brief attachment to [[Hollywood Records]]<ref name="NWIMN" />) had been withdrawn due to the Daddies' refusal to adhere to any one particular genre.<ref name="LA Times">{{cite news |title=The Cherry Poppin' Daddies |author=Locey, Bill |newspaper=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' |date=July 20, 1995 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-20/news/vl-25751_1_cherry-poppin-daddies |accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref><ref name="SFWeekly">{{Cite web|author=Tudor, Silke |title=House of Tudor |url=http://www.sfweekly.com/1997-08-06/music/the-house-of-tudor/ |work= |publisher=''[[SF Weekly]]'' |date=August 6, 1997 |accessdate=May 31, 2010}}</ref> 

The Daddies exercised this experimental freedom on their second album, ''[[Rapid City Muscle Car]]''. Self-produced and self-recorded, ''Rapid City Muscle Car'' was the band's attempt at creating an eclectic [[concept album]] wherein each track was composed in a different musical style yet were all thematically united through interconnected lyricism, utilizing funk, ska, punk, swing, [[psychedelic rock]], [[country music|country]], [[rockabilly]], [[big band]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[hard rock]] and [[lounge music|lounge]].<ref name="NWIMN" /><ref name="Perry">{{Cite web|author=Perry, Steve |title='Rapid City Muscle Car' entry on the official Cherry Poppin' Daddies website |url=http://www.daddies.com/Details.cfm?ProdID=34&category=0 |work= |publisher=www.daddies.com |accessdate=March 31, 2010}}</ref><ref name="InMusic">{{Cite web|author=Steininger, Alex |title=Interview with Steve Perry |url=http://www.inmusicwetrust.com/articles/01h06.html |work=In Music We Trust |publisher= |year=1997 |accessdate=August 11, 2009}}</ref> Released on the band's self-run label Space Age Bachelor Pad Records in December 1994, the album sold decently, though failed to match the success of ''Ferociously Stoned''.<ref name="LA Times" />

Despite their album's success, this period ultimately proved to be the most difficult of the Daddies' career. Consistently performing to little media recognition, full-time touring was becoming both a personal and financial strain on the band members, leading to frequent quitting. The Daddies experienced at least fifteen line-up changes from 1996 to 1997, including the departure of original keyboardist Chris Azorr and co-founder Schmid, leaving only Perry and trumpeter [[Dana Heitman]] as the sole remnants of the original line-up.<ref name="SKAzaam" /> With no label backing them, the band had trouble securing distribution and press outside of the Northwest, oftentimes being unable to get their CDs sold in cities they were touring to.<ref name="Tangents">{{cite journal |last1=Fulmer |first1=Carl |last2=Coston |first2=Daniel |year=1998 |month= |title=Tangents Magazine Interview |journal=Tangents Magazine}}</ref> Feeling they had finally hit a [[wikt:glass ceiling|glass ceiling]] as an independent band, Perry said the Daddies were ultimately left with one of two options at this time: either sign to a label or break up.<ref name="Canoe" /><ref name="Tangents" />

Following a national tour together, ska band [[Reel Big Fish]] helped arrange a meeting between their label [[Mojo Records]] and the Daddies in the hopes of obtaining the band a [[distribution deal]], negotiations which instead led to Mojo signing the Daddies to a [[recording contract|record contract]].<ref name="Focus"/><ref name="Clayton">{{cite news |title=Warped Tour Interview |author=Hollifield, Clayton |newspaper=[[The Daily of the University of Washington]] |date=July 7, 1998}}</ref> ''Zoot Suit Riot'' was licensed and reissued by Mojo and given national distribution in July 1997, less than four months after its original release. 

By October 1997, steady sales of ''Zoot Suit Riot'' and the rising popularity of swing led Mojo to release one of the album's [[bonus track]]s, "[[Zoot Suit Riot (song)|Zoot Suit Riot]]", as a single and distribute it among [[modern rock]] radio stations, much to the protest of the Daddies themselves, who couldn't envision a swing song receiving airplay on mainstream radio and were concerned over losing money from its promotion.<ref name="Lofi" /><ref name="Tangents" /><ref name="Clayton" /> To the surprise of the band, "Zoot Suit Riot" soon found regular rotation on stations such as Los Angeles' [[KROQ]], one of several swing singles that helped establish the genre in the mainstream and led to its eventual commercial breakthrough, with the Daddies at its forefront.<ref name="Billboard">{{cite journal |last=Morris |first=Chris |year=1998 |month= March |title=2 Daddies Swing Big |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |issue=Vol. 110, No. 12 |page=112 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Interview with Cherry Poppin' Daddies |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010208171927/www.amctv.com/about/cherrypoppin1.html |work=www.amctv.com |publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |date=c. 2001 |accessdate=March 31, 2010}}</ref> By mid-1998, the Daddies had emerged as one of the most successful bands of the swing revival: after climbing to number one on ''Billboard'''s [[Top Heatseekers]], ''Zoot Suit Riot'' became the first neo-swing album to crack the Top 40 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at number 17 and spending an ultimate total of 53 weeks on the charts.<ref>{{Cite web|author= |title=Zoot Suit Riot: Billboard Charts |url=http://www.billboard.com/#/artist/cherry-poppin-daddies/chart-history/30613 |work= |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= |accessdate=June 21, 2010}}</ref> In June 1998, the album had sold 500,000 copies, going on to surpass sales of 1.4 million by August.<ref name="SkaSuit">{{cite news |title=Newfound Popularity of Ska Suits These Daddies Just Fine |author=Stout, Gene |newspaper=What's Happening |date=July 3, 1998 |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/archives/1998/9807030008.asp }}</ref><ref name="RIAA">[http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS RIAA - Cherry Poppin' Daddies] Recording Industry Association of America.

Although the Daddies were experiencing commercial success under the guise of a swing band, having been declared the "leaders" of the revival by ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'', the band openly contested being labeled as such at the exclusion of the rest of their music and dominant ska influence, and adamantly tried to disassociate themselves from the [[retro]] swing scene and in particular its [[nostalgia]]-based mentality.<ref name="Dark" /><ref name="RollingStone">{{cite journal |last=duBrowa |first=Corey |year=1998 |month=December |title=Poppin' Off: Cherry Poppin' Daddies Take a Swing at Swing |journal=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref><ref name="Post" /> While still vocal supporters of both the movement and its bands, Perry explained to ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' in July 1998, "it's not our mission to be a swing band.

In the fall of 1999, the Daddies returned to the studio to record their fourth album, ''[[Soul Caddy]]''. A loose concept album reflecting Perry's disillusionment over the cultural zeitgeist and his experience with fame (as he described it, a "bittersweet" record about "being alienated and hoping to connect"), ''Soul Caddy'' saw a continuation of the band's musically varied format, intended to introduce the Daddies' true sound and personality to both their swing-based fans and a wider audience.<ref name="Ink19">{{Cite web|author=Feifer, Jason |title=Listen Up, They've Got Something to Say |url=http://www.ink19.com/issues/november2000/inkSpots/cherryPoppinDaddies.html |work=Ink19.com |publisher= |date=October 2000 |accessdate=August 10, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Graff2000" /><ref name="Virgin">{{Cite web|author=Koffman, Linda |title=A Not So Cheery Cherry Daddy |url=http://www.virginmegamagazine.com/default.asp?aid=21  |work=www.virginmegamagazine.com |publisher= |date=June 20, 1998 |accessdate=August 12, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030517105041/http://www.virginmegamagazine.com/default.asp?aid=21 |archivedate = May 17, 2003}}</ref><ref name="Rentilly2000">{{cite journal |last=Rentilly |first=J. |year= 2000 |month= November |title=Cherry Poppin' Daddies |journal=[[Gallery (magazine)|Gallery]]}}</ref> Drawing from the rock and pop of the 1960s and 1970s, ''Soul Caddy'' interweaved swing and ska with [[glam rock]], [[soul music|soul]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], [[folk music|folk]], [[Mod revival]], funk and punk.<ref name="SoulDaddies">{{cite news |title=Soul Daddies: Hometown Boys Play the Celebration Sunday |author=Salvia, Vanessa |newspaper=[[Eugene Weekly]] |date=September 14, 2000 |url= }}</ref> 

Despite allowing the Daddies creative control over ''Soul Caddy''{{'}}s production, Mojo's response to the album was marginal.<ref name="SoulDaddies" /> Claiming that the new material was not like "the Cherry Poppin' Daddies people know and love", the label did little to promote either the album or its glam-styled single, "[[Diamond Light Boogie]]", at one point releasing the latter without the band's name on it, allegedly due to hesitancy over marketing a rock single from a band primarily known as swing.<ref name="OrgQuart">{{Cite web|author=duBrowa, Corey |title=Dropping In |url=http://www.oregonquarterly.com/autumn2008/feature3.php |work= |publisher=[[Oregon Quarterly]] |year=2008 |accessdate=August 11, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Salmon2008">{{Cite web|author=Salmon, Ben |title=A different kind of revival: Cherry Poppin' Daddies are back, doing what they've always done |url=http://www.bendbulletin.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080711/NEWS0107/807110314/1002&nav_category= |work= |publisher=[[Bend Bulletin]] |date=July 11, 2008 |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}</ref> With virtually no promotion, ''Soul Caddy'' was released on October 3, 2000.

After low ticket sales brought the Daddies' accompanying tour to an early close, the band reached a mutual agreement upon taking an indefinite hiatus in December 2000.<ref name="2002Int" />

===Hiatus (2001-2006)===
With nearly a decade of full-time band activity come to an end, the Daddies went their separate paths. After briefly relocating to [[Manhattan]], Perry returned to Eugene to form the [[glam punk]] band [[White Hot Odyssey]] with Jason Moss, releasing an [[White Hot Odyssey (album)|album]] on [[Jive Records]] in 2004. During this time, Perry pursued an [[undergraduate degree]] at the University of Oregon, graduating in 2004 with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[molecular biology]].<ref name="OrgQuart" /> Dan Schmid and keyboardist [[Dustin Lanker]] devoted themselves to their own project, the [[piano rock]] band [[The Visible Men]], recording two albums and touring extensively throughout the early and mid-2000s. Drummer [[Tim Donahue (drummer)|Tim Donahue]], after a stint with The Visible Men, played in [[Yngwie Malmsteen]]'s band on their 2001 European tour and worked as a [[session musician|session drummer]] for artists including [[TobyMac]] and [[Shawn McDonald]].<ref name="Donahue">{{Cite web|author=Donahue, Tim |title=Tim Donahue - Bio |url=http://www.rockdrummer.com/about-2 |publisher=www.rockdrummer.com |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tim-donahue-p174967 |title=Tim Donahue | Allmusic |publisher=[[allmusic]]}}</ref>

The Daddies officially regrouped in February 2002 to play a sporadic series of Northwest music festivals, though announced no future plans for new material or another tour. Now playing as few as ten shows a year, the band's performances became limited entirely to hometown shows and commissions for one-off "swingin' hits" concerts at various fairs and festivals across the United States.<ref name="2002Int" /><ref name="Hager2004">{{cite news |title=Golf still rocks for the Daddies |author=Hager, Hank |newspaper=''[[The Register-Guard]]'' |date=June 25, 2004}}</ref>

===''Susquehanna'' and return to independent label (2006<U+2013>2009)===

Independently recorded during the summer of 2007, the Daddies' fifth album, ''[[Susquehanna (album)|Susquehanna]]'', was released exclusively though the band's website in February 2008. Taking the shape of a narrative concept album which Perry detailed as a portrait of "various relationships in decay", ''Susquehanna'' featured prominent strains of [[Latin American music|Latin]] and [[Caribbean music|Caribbean]]-influenced music, incorporating flourishes of [[flamenco]], [[Latin rock]] and [[reggae]] into the band's traditional mix of rock, ska and swing.<ref name="SusqAll">{{Cite web|author=MacNeil, Jason |title=Susquehanna > Overview |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1346306|pure_url=yes}} |work= |publisher=[[Allmusic]].com |date=2008 |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Fitzpatrick2009">{{Cite web|author=Fitzpatrick, Brian |title=Music Review: Cherry Poppin' Daddies - Susquehanna |url=http://blogcritics.org/music/article/music-review-cherry-poppin-daddies-susquehanna1/ |work=[[Blogcritics]] |publisher=www.blogcritics.com] |date=September 25, 2009 |accessdate=July 7, 2010}}</ref> Though its low-profile release went mostly unnoticed by the mainstream media, response from internet-based publications ranged from mixed to positive, with reviewers once again polarized over the album's eclectic blend of genres.<ref name="Celebrity">{{Cite web|author=Groff, Mallory |title=Cherry Poppin' Daddies - Susquehanna |url=http://thecelebritycafe.com/cd/full_review/13299.html |work= |publisher=[[The Celebrity Cafe]] |date=March 14, 2008 |accessdate=August 11, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Sawdey2008">{{Cite web|author=Sawdey, Evan |title=The Cherry Poppin' Daddies - Susquehanna |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/the-cherry-poppin-daddies-susquehanna/ |work= |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |date=June 10, 2008 |accessdate=August 11, 2009}}</ref> In support of ''Susquehanna'', the Daddies embarked on another full-length tour in mid-2008, followed by a tour of Europe, their first visit to the continent since 1998.<ref name="Arts">{{Cite web|author=Mohler, Bennett |title=The Cherry Poppin' Daddies Are Back |url=http://media.www.lcctorch.com/media/storage/paper1259/news/2008/11/20/Arts/The-Cherry.Poppin.Daddies.Are.Back-3556038.shtml |work= |publisher=The Torch |date=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=August 11, 2009}}</ref>

===Lyrical===
[[File:StevePerrySinging.jpg|right|175px|thumb|Steve Perry is credited as the creative force behind the Daddies.]]
Steve Perry is the Daddies' sole lyricist, and writes the majority of his songs in a fictional [[narrative]] format he credits as being influenced by [[Randy Newman]] and [[Ray Davies]], often told about or through the [[unreliable narrator|unreliable perspective]] of downtrodden characters struggling against adversity.<ref name="Rocket" /><ref name="Inland" /><ref name="Dark" /> [[Alcoholism]], [[death|mortality]], sex, [[class struggle]] and [[family dysfunction]] are recurring themes in his lyrics, often dealt with [[satire|satirically]].<ref name="Baddest" /><ref name="SFWeekly" /><ref name="Dark" /> ''[[The Register-Guard]]'' has described Perry's lyrics as "ribald [and] often despairing" but having a "sense of humor", "[probing] the underbelly of society, stabbing at oppressors such as...the pressure to conform".<ref name="PoppinUp" /> While the Daddies have been criticized for juxtaposing lurid subject matter and [[profanity]] with "innocent" music such as swing<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpyu.org/Page.aspx?id=76995 |title=The Cherry Poppin' Daddies |publisher=Center for Parent/Youth Understanding |date=1998 |accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref><ref name="Rocket" />, ''[[The New York Times]]'' has lauded Perry's lyricism as "vivid poetry" containing "an inventiveness missing from the other swing bands' lyrics".<ref>{{cite news |title=Critic's Notebook: It Don't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing |author=Ratliff, Ben |newspaper=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=April 7, 1998}}</ref>

All of the Daddies' studio albums are written to varying extents as [[concept album]]s, featuring recurring lyrical themes or a progressive narrative as means of providing threads of thematic stability despite wildly varying musical styles.<ref name="Canoe" /><ref name="Lepire2009">{{Cite web|author=Lepire, Brian |title=New Cherries to Pop: Interview with Steve Perry about the Rise and Return of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies |url=http://www.staythirstymedia.com/200910-038/html/200910-steve-perry-cpd-interview.html |work= |publisher=Stay Thirsty Media |date=October 3, 2009 |accessdate=April 3, 2010}}</ref>

==Reception and influence==
In their native Oregon, the Daddies have been labeled "a Northwest institution"<ref name="WillametteArticle">{{cite journal |publisher=''[[Willamette Week]]'' |url=http://wweek.com/editorial/3602/13345/ |title=Sparkle and Fade |author=Jarman, Casey |date=November 18, 2009 |accessdate=December 22, 2010}}</ref>, having been inducted into the [[Oregon Music Hall of Fame]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.omhof.org/honorees |title=Oregon Music Hall of Fame Honorees |author= |date=October 2009 |work= |publisher=www.omhof.org |accessdate=November 16, 2009 }}</ref> ''[[The Register-Guard]]'' has credited the band for shaping Eugene's musical culture in the 1990s, dubbing the scene "the house that the Daddies built"<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/It%27s+been+30+years+since+WOWathon%3F-a0139735841 |title=It's been 30 years since WOWathon? |author=Lamberson, Carolyn |publisher=''[[The Register-Guard]]'' |date=December 9, 2005}}</ref>, while ''[[Eugene Weekly]]'' has added, "when some people think of the Northwest music scene, they think of [[grunge]]. If you<U+2019>re a Eugenean, however, you might think of swing, thanks to [the] Cherry Poppin' Daddies".<ref>{{cite journal |publisher=''[[Eugene Weekly]]'' |date=November 12, 2009 |title=Eugene Weekly - Arts Calendar}}</ref> The ''[[Phoenix New Times]]'' listed the "woefully unsung" Daddies as among the bands that defined the Northwest's "alternative to [[alternative rock|alternative]]", "[delivering] rock with more complexity than three-chord guitar riffs and social critique without heavy-handed cynicism".<ref name="Phoenix" /><ref name="Cook1994" /> Seattle's ''[[The Rocket (newspaper)|Rocket]]'' noted of their influence, "The Daddies were busting out the swing before the [[Squirrel Nut Zippers]], stirring cocktails before [[Combustible Edison]] and skating the ska long before [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]]...the band shakes out an incredible variety of sounds with peerless verve and polish".<ref name="Rocket" />
