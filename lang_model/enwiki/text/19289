==Background==
''Guide to Better Living'' is the debut studio album by Australian alternative metal and post-grunge band [[Grinspoon]]. In 1995 the group formed in [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]], New South Wales and are fronted by [[Phil Jamieson]] on [[vocals]] and [[guitar]] with Pat Davern on guitar, Joe Hansen on [[bass guitar]] and Kristian Hopes on [[drum kit|drums]].<ref name="Howl"/><ref name="ARDb"/> The group's second extended play, ''[[Licker Bottle Cozy]]'', was recorded in June 1996 with [[Phil McKellar]] as producer.<ref name="Howl"/><ref name="ARDb"/>

In February 1997 the band recorded their debut album, with McKellar again, at Rockinghorse Studios in [[Byron Bay, New South Wales|Byron Bay]] and mixed at Studio 301 in Sydney in April. The band considered the title, ''Sell Your Parents'', but eventually decided on ''Guide to Better Living'', after a 1960s catalogue of [[Sunbeam Australia|Sunbeam]] white goods.<ref name="Howl">{{cite web | url = http://www.howlspace.com.au/en4/grinspoon/grinspoon.htm | title = Grinspoon | last = Nimmervoll | first = Ed | authorlink = Ed Nimmervoll | publisher = Howlspace.

Passagen (Magnus Holmgren) | first = Magnus | last = Holmgren | accessdate = 22 March 2012 }}</ref> It had a slightly heavier sound than their earlier work. On 16 September 1997 they released the work on [[Grudge Records]].<ref name="Howl"/><ref name="ARDb"/> It peaked at number&nbsp;11 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Charts]]<ref name="AusCharts"/> and by year's end it was certified [[List of music recording sales certifications#Albums|platinum]] with shipment of over 70,000 units in Australia.<ref name="ARIACred1997">{{cite web |url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-albums-1997.htm |title=ARIA Charts - Accreditations - 1997 Albums |publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> It represents the sound and variety of their early career with heavier songs like "Pressure Tested 1984" open the album, whilst in the middle are more classic rock songs like "Repeat" and "Don't Go Away" and then towards the end the ballad "Bad Funk Stripe." 

In Australia a limited edition was issued featuring five live songs<U+2014>illustrating the band's sense of humour and ability to play live<U+2014>and a [[hidden track]], the [[acoustic music|acoustic]] "Protest". The live tracks were recorded at Grudgefest in Sydney on Saturday 27 September 1997. The United States branch of [[Universal Records]] signed the band by late 1998 and released an altered version of ''Guide to Better Living'' on 9 March 1999. The cover was also modified with the band's name and album title written in a different style. The album sold over 12,000 copies in the US on the back of extensive touring by the band in North America<ref>{{Cite news | title = Australia: Southern Exposure | work = Billbosrd | first1 = Thom | last1 = Duffy |first2 = Christie | last2 = Eliezer | page = 67 | date = 16 October 1999 | url = http://books.google.com.au/books?id=8g0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA103&dq=%22Guide+to+Better+Living%22+grinspoon&hl=en&sa=X&ei=u9hqT8aLEKesiAfa1dzkBQ&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22Guide%20to%20Better%20Living%22%20grinspoon&f=false | publisher = Prometheus Global Media | accessdate = 22 March 2012 }}</ref> with bands such as [[Creed (band)|Creed]], [[Lit (band)|Lit]], [[Godsmack]] and [[Anthrax (band)|Anthrax]].<ref name="Howl"/> The group's second album, ''[[Easy (Grinspoon album)|Easy]]'' followed in November 1999.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sputnikmusic.com/bands/Grinspoon/1868/ | title = Grinspoon reviews, music, news | publisher = [[Sputnikmusic]] (Jeremy Ferwerda) | accessdate = 23 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.thebulletreviews.com/features/lesson2.html | title = Feature: Katey's Aussie Bands 101 - Lesson 2 <U+2013> Classic Aussie Rock: Grinspoon | last = Katey | work = The Bullet Reviews | publisher = Imre | accessdate = 23 March 2012 }}</ref>

According to the Worldwide Home of Australasian Music and More Online (WHAMMO), "[a]fter being discovered by Triple J and then signed by Grudge records, this was the album that hammered it home - Grinspoon were destined to be the most rock and roll party down aviator-shades-wearing Oz rock band of the late '90s".<ref name="WHAMMO"/>
