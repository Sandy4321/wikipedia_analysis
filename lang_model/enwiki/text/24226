The upperside of the male is unusual in that it has only a small amount of pale orange on the discal area of the forewing below the cell; a pattern more reminiscent of females of the genus. The underside ground colour is light slate-brown with a glossy sheen. The usual post-discal striae or the genus are present in an ochreous colour and there is a diffuse ochreous marhinal band on both wings.
