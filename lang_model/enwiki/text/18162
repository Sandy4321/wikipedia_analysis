The group gained attention at the beginning of their career with songs such as "[[Into the New World (song)|Into the New World]]" and "[[Kissing You (Girls' Generation song)|Kissing You]]" but it was not until 2009 when they gained significant popularity with their hit single "[[Gee (Girls' Generation song)|Gee]]", which was classified by the online music store [[melon (online music service)|MelOn]] as the most popular song of the decade in South Korea (ranking based on chart performance).<ref>{{cite web|title=2000<U+B144><U+B300> <U+C74C><U+C545><U+C758> <U+D750><U+B984>|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110503062457/http://www.melon.com/svc/static_html/melonchart/age_chart_search.jsp?chartType=AG&chartDate=2000&classCd=KPOP|url=http://www.melon.com/svc/static_html/melonchart/age_chart_search.jsp?chartType=AG&chartDate=2000&classCd=KPOP|year=2011|accessdate=January 18, 2014|archivedate=May 3, 2011|language=Korean}}</ref> The group solidified their place in the Korean music industry with follow-up singles "[[Tell Me Your Wish (Genie) (song)|Tell Me Your Wish]]", "[[Run Devil Run (Girls' Generation song)|Run Devil Run]]", and "[[Oh!

The group began a foray into the Japanese music scene in late 2010 under [[Universal Music Group|Nayutawave Records]], with Japanese remakes of their 2009 Korean hits "Genie" and "Gee".

==History==

===Pre-debut===
After the success of [[S.M. Entertainment]]'s boy band, [[Super Junior]], the company planned to debut a new girl group, which would ultimately turn into Girls' Generation, featuring a start-up roster of 11 members.<ref name="pre-debut history">[http://snsdkorean.com/2010/01/02/the-making-of-so-nyuh-shi-dae/ The Making of So Nyuh Shi Dae <U+00AB> SNSD Korean<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> For nearly two years, Korean websites speculated about which of the female SM Entertainment trainees would be placed into the group. The candidate members were professionally trained primarily in singing and dancing, while some were also selected to be trained in acting and modeling. Many of the candidate members had participated in the Korean entertainment industry through their participation in magazine advertisements, television commercials, and small television drama or film appearances,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} and Sooyoung even debuted in the Japanese market in 2002 as part of the pop duo, Route <U+03B8>, which soon disbanded in one year.<ref name="route0 profile">{{ja icon}} [http://www.randc.jp/route0/profile.html Route {{theta}} <U+2013> official website <U+2013> profile]</ref><ref>[http://www.musicasia.net/sooyoung-choi-sooyoung Sooyoung <U+2013> Choi Sooyoung | Music Asia | Singer <U+2013> Asia Music Portal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The group witnessed several revisions, as members were either added or cut, until final line-up of the debuting nine was decided. Prior to their announcement, it was rumored that the group would be named "Super Girls" after their so-called male counterparts, Super Junior.<ref name="pre-debut history" />

===2007<U+2013>2008: Debut and ''Girls' Generation''===
In July 2007, Girls' Generation had their unofficial first stage performance on [[Mnet (TV channel)|Mnet]]'s ''School of Rock'' where the group performed their first single, "[[Into the New World (song)|Into the New World]]" ({{lang|ko|<U+B2E4><U+C2DC> <U+B9CC><U+B09C> <U+C138><U+ACC4>}}).

The group's first single was physically released soon after, including an instrumental of the group's debut song and two other tracks: "Beginning" and "Perfect for You."

Things took a turn when an exclusive report by OSEN revealed that during the editing process for Girls' Generation's music video on the 13th, a loss of data occurred resulting in a deletion of a portion of the footage. Girls' Generation originally planned to release their title track and music video on the 19th and kick off their comeback stage on 'M! Countdown' on the 20th ahead of their album release on the 24th. However, if a re-filming is required to accommodate for the loss of data, insiders are saying that there is a possibility that Girls' Generation's comeback or MV release date may be pushed back by up to two weeks to allow for the filming and re-editing. <ref>{{cite news|title=[<U+B2E8><U+B3C5>] <U+C18C><U+B140><U+C2DC><U+B300>, <U+BBA4><U+BE44> <U+B370><U+C774><U+D130> <U+D30C><U+C190> <U+C0AC><U+ACE0> <U+BC1C><U+C0DD>..'<U+CEF4><U+BC31> <U+BE44><U+C0C1>'|url=http://osen.mt.co.kr/article/G1109783576|accessdate=February 14, 2014|newspaper=Osen}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Girls' Generation confirms comeback date with 1st teaser for 'Mr.Mr'!|url=http://www.allkpop.com/article/2014/02/girls-generation-confirms-comeback-date-with-1st-teaser-for-mrmr#axzz2tPluqSOK|publisher=allkpop|accessdate=February 10, 2014|date=February 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Girls' Generation's upcoming music video runs into a mishap, may possibly cause delays|url=http://www.allkpop.com/article/2014/02/girls-generations-upcoming-music-video-runs-into-a-mishap-may-possibly-cause-delays#axzz2tPluqSOK|publisher=allkpop|date=February 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Insiders say 2NE1 may be going up against Girls' Generation this month with album release|url=http://www.allkpop.com/article/2014/02/insiders-say-2ne1-may-be-going-up-against-girls-generation-this-month-with-album-release#axzz2tPluqSOK|date=February 12, 2014|author=allkpop}}</ref>
