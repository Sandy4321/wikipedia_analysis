'''''Blood Simple''''' is a [[1985]] [[neo-noir]] [[crime film]]. It was the directorial debut of [[Joel and Ethan Coen]], and the first major film of [[cinematographer]] [[Barry Sonnenfeld]], who later became a noted director. The film's title derives from [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s novel ''[[Red Harvest]]'', in which "blood simple" is a term coined to describe the addled, fearful mindset people are in after a prolonged immersion in violent situations.

In [[2001]], a "director's cut" DVD was released. It placed 98th on [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills]].

==Reception==
Upon its release, [[Pauline Kael]] gave the film a negative review, criticizing the film's style over content: "But the reason the camera whoop-de-do is so noticeable is that there<U+2019>s nothing else going on. The movie doesn<U+2019>t even seem meant to have any rhythmic flow; the Coens just want us to respond to a bunch of 'touches' on routine themes".<ref name= "kael">{{cite news | last = Kael | first = Pauline | coauthors = | title = Plain and Simple | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[The New Yorker]] | date = [[February 25]], [[1985]] | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1985/02/25/1985_02_25_078_TNY_CARDS_000131235?currentPage=1 | accessdate = 2008-02-19 }}</ref>

However, the film has a 98% "fresh" rating on the film review website Rotten Tomatoes (as of Febuary 2008), indicating that just one review of 58 was negative.

==Director's cut==
[[Image:Bloodsimple.jpg|thumb|175px|DVD cover for the film]]
''Blood Simple'' was re-released theatrically in 2000 and on DVD in 2001 in a "directors' cut". Unusually for such an exercise it is some three minutes ''shorter'' than the original theatrical release. The Coens shortened the film by tightening the editing, shortening some shots and removing others altogether. In addition, they resolved longstanding rights issues with the music: the original theatrical version of the film made prominent use of [[The Four Tops]]' "[[It's the Same Old Song]]", but this had to be replaced with [[Neil Diamond]]'s "I'm a Believer" (made famous by [[The Monkees]]' cover) for the US home video edition (though not for international video versions). The "directors' cut" reinstated the Four Tops track, as the Coens had always intended.

==DVD==
The 2001 DVD release features several spoofs of DVD '[[special features]]'. One is an introduction to the film by fictional [[film historian]] "Mortimer Young", who claims that the Director's Cut removes some of "the boring bits" and adds other parts. (This was also included in the theatrical release of the Director's Cut.)

It also includes an audio commentary by "Kenneth Loring", the fictional [[artistic director]] of the equally fictional "Forever Young Films". Loring offers several entirely spurious "facts": for example, he claims that the scene with Ray and Abby driving in the rain talking about Marty was acted out in reverse as well as upside down, in order to synch the headlights passing the car just as certain lines were said (he claims that filming the scene backwards and upside down was the logical choice to get the timing right, and that the actors are wearing hair spray to keep their hair pointing "down").  Elsewhere in the commentary, he claims that in scenes with both dialogue and music, the actors simply mouth the words and record them in [[post-production]], so as not to interfere with the music; that Marty's dog is animatronic; that the sweat on various actors is "movie sweat", gathered from the flanks of [[Palomino horse]]s; that [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Rosemary Clooney]] were at one time intended for the film; and that a fly buzzing about is not real, but the product of [[computer generated imagery]].  "Loring" is voiced by actor [[Jim Piddock]], using a script written by the Coen brothers.

The score to ''Blood Simple'' is written by [[Carter Burwell]], the first of his collaborations with the [[Coen Brothers]]. He would go on to write scores for all of their films ([[as of 2007]]). ''Blood Simple'' was the first feature film score for Burwell, and besides working with the Coens, he would be become a much-in-demand composer for Hollywood.

The score for ''Blood Simple'' is a mix of solo piano and electronic ambient sounds. One track, "Monkey Chant" is based on "[[Kecak]]", the "[[Ramayana]] Monkey Chant" of [[Bali]].

Selections from Burwell's score were released on an album in 1987, along with selections from the Coen's next film, ''[[Raising Arizona]]''.
