'''T. J. (Tomar Jacob) Hileman''' (1882<U+2013>1945) was an American photographer born in [[Marienville, Pennsylvania]], who is renowned for his photos of [[Glacier Park]] in [[Montana]],  and [[Blackfoot]] people.

After working a while in Chicago and graduating from Effingham School of Photography there, he moved to [[Colorado]] and began to take photographs. In 1911 Hileman moved to [[Kalispell, Montana]] to open his own portrait studio. He and Alice Georgeson were the first couple to marry in [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] in 1913.<ref>[http://www.hockadaymuseum.org/Permanent%20Collection/hileman.htm Hockaday Museum of Art]</ref>

Appointed the official photographer for the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] in 1924, Hileman took photos of Glacier National Park and [[Waterton Lakes National Park]] in [[Alberta]], Canada, moving bulky camera equipment by packhorse, even at times perching on a narrow ledge to get just the right image on film. He also photographed the [[Prince of Wales Hotel]] in [[Waterton Park, Alberta|Waterton]], Alberta, which was built by the railway. In 1926 Hileman opened photo-finishing labs in both Glacier Park Lodge and Many Glacier Hotel, which were convenient for tourists who could drop off their film evenings and pick up their prints the next morning.

In 1985 the Glacier Natural History Association purchased more than a thousand of Hileman's [[nitrocellulose#Nitrocellulose_film|nitrate]] negatives, which were added to the collection of Hileman's albums which already contained more than 2,000 prints. Some 107 of these photos were purchased by the [[Glenbow Museum]] in Canada, where they comprise part of their collection relating to [[Blackfoot]] history.<ref>[http://www.glenbow.org/collections/search/findingAids/archhtm/hileman.cfm Glenbow Museum]</ref> These photos are especially valuable to researchers for their examples of [[Kainai]] and [[South Peigan]] styles of clothing, hairstyles, ornaments, and housing.<ref>[http://ww2.glenbow.org/search/archivesPhotosResults.aspx 99 Hileman photos]</ref>

Hileman's 1938 photo of [[Grinnell Glacier]] has been used as a early image documenting the state of that glacier in the first half of the 1900s. Subsequent photos in the ensuing decades, which have been taken from the same vantage point, show evidence of a steady state of retreat for that glacier.
