'''Wyoming County''' is a [[county]] located in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York]]. At the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]], the population was 43,424. The [[county seat]] is [[Warsaw (village), New York|Warsaw]]. The name is from a modified [[Lenape|Delaware]] [[Native American (U.S.)|Indian]] word meaning "broad bottom lands". Wyoming County was formed from [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee County]] in 1841.

== History ==
When counties were established in New York State in 1683, the present Wyoming County was part of [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of [[Vermont]] and, in theory, extending westward to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of [[Cumberland County, New York|Cumberland County]], and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester County]], both containing territory now in Vermont.

On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon County]], contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], and the county included the western part of the [[Adirondack Mountains]] and the area west of the West Branch of the [[Delaware River]]. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for [[William Tryon]], colonial governor of New York.

In the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to [[Canada]]. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], the name of Tryon County was changed to [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery County]] in order to honor the general, [[Richard Montgomery]], who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of [[Quebec]], replacing the name of the hated British governor.

In 1789, [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] was split off from Montgomery.

Almost all of the land west of the [[Genesee River]], including all of present day Wyoming County, was part of the [[History of New York|''Holland Land Purchase'']] in 1793 and was sold through the Holland Land Company's office in [[Batavia, New York|Batavia]], starting in 1801.

[[Genesee County, New York|Genesee County]] was created by a splitting of Ontario County in 1802. This was much larger than the present Genesee County, however. It was reduced in size in 1806 by creating [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany County]]; again in 1808 by creating [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]], and [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara Counties]]. Niagara County at that time also included the present [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]].

In 1821, portions of Genesee County were combined with portions of Ontario County to create [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]] and [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe Counties]].

Genesee County was further reduced in size in 1824 by creating [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans County]].

Finally, in 1841, Wyoming County was created from Genesee County.

==Points of interest==
*[[Letchworth State Park]], on the [[Genesee River]] forms part of the southeastern boundary of the county. A deep gorge with three major waterfalls characterize this scenic and historic area, created when the last [[Ice age]] [[glacier]] diverted the river and forced it to cut a new valley. It is the home area of [[Mary Jemison]], the ''White Woman of the Genesee'', who was captured as a young person by the [[Seneca tribe]] and became an important figure in negotiations between the tribe and the land companies.

*Middlebury Academy, in Wyoming village, the first high school level school west of the Genesee. The [[Greek revival]] building still exists and is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

*Hillside Inn, opened originally as a [[destination spa|spa]] at mineral springs on the hill above Wyoming village around 1841, has entertained many important persons, including Theodore Roosevelt and his family and Susan B. Anthony,

*Arcade and Attica  Railroad is a restoration of a steam locomotive.

*Attica maximum security prison is located in the northernmost part of the county.

*Gaslight Village - downtown Wyoming is a historic village lit by gas street lamps. Deposits of natural gas and salt have been an economic factor in the development of the area.

*Silver Lake - this tiny glacial lake is the only one of the [[Finger Lakes]] group of [[lake]]s that is west of the Genesee.

*Morton Salt- One of the largest salt mines in the Northeast is located in Silver Springs and has been running since the mid to late 1800s.

==Geography==
Wyoming County is in the western part of New York State, east of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and slightly west of due south of [[Rochester, Monroe County, New York|Rochester]].  The county is in the [[Holland Purchase]] Region.

The county is largely rural, dotted with small [[town]]s. Even the county seat, Warsaw is quite small. Much of the area is [[Forest|wooded]], used for [[timber]]. Some that are predominantly [[maple]] are tapped each spring for the production of [[maple syrup]]. [[Agriculture]] is mostly small family [[dairy]] farms, or hobby farms for people who work in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] or [[Batavia, New York|Batavia]]. [[Apple]] [[orchard]]s were once a major agricultural endeavor, but only a few are left. The area is well known for outdoor sports, being an excellent area for [[fishing]], [[hunting]], and [[Snowmobile|snowmobiling]].

An active [[geologic fault]] runs down the Dale valley through Linden, to the east of Batavia and out into Lake Ontario. Movement of the fault is an occasional source of minor [[earthquake]]s, which, at most, have toppled a couple [[chimney]]s. The Dale Valley has been developed as a source of [[salt]] by way of [[brine]] wells, for the [[chemical]] industry. A [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] moves the brine to [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of 596&nbsp;[[square mile]]s (1,545&nbsp;[[km<U+00B2>]]), of which, 593&nbsp;square miles (1,536&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of it is land and 4&nbsp;square miles (9&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of it (0.59%) is water.

[[Oatka Creek]], an important [[tributary]] of the [[Genesee River]] has its source in the [[Gainesville, New York|Town of Gainesville]].
