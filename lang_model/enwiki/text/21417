The '''Montauk Point land claim''' was a series of three lawsuits brought by Chief Wyandank Pharaoh, nephew of the [[Stephen Talkhouse]] who died in the same year (1879) that the tribe lost the last remaining vestige of their territory in the [[New York state courts]], claiming [[Montauk Point State Park|Montauk Point]] on behalf of the [[Montaukett]] Indians, against the [[Long Island Rail Road]] (LIRR) and its predecessors in title. 

The first suit, '''''Montauk Tribe of Indians v. Long Island R.R. Co.''''', brought by Wyandank Pharaoh in the name of the tribe, was dismissed because the tribe had not been explicitly authorized by the state to sue in its own name.<ref name="mtoi"/>

As recommended by the Appellate Division's opinion, the second suit, '''''Johnson v. Long Island R.R. Co.''''', was brought in the name of Eugene M. Johnson, a citizen and tribal member.  The New York Court of Appeals disavowed the previous dicta of the Appellate Division, and held that neither an individual Indian nor a tribe could sue in court without enabling legislation.<ref name="johnson"/>

The tribe failed in its efforts to convince the federal government to pass legislation enabling the tribe to bring the claim in federal court.  In 1906, the state passed a statute enabling the tribe to sue, and Wyandank Pharaoh brought a third suit, '''''Pharaoh v. Benson''''', in the name of the tribe.  Reaching the merits, the New York courts held that the tribe no longer existed and that the transactions were valid.<ref name="pharaoh"/> Since the litigation, the Montauks have failed in their efforts to obtain compensation from the federal and state government, and much of the land in question has come to be held by public parks.

==Background==

[[File:LIRR map 1876.svg|thumb|right|Map of the [[Long Island Rail Road]], circa 1876]]
Circa 1875, the Montauk tribe began renting out Montauk Point for pasturage through the [[Proprietors' Company]]; the company took possession of the grazing allotments, and paid the tribe an annuity.<ref name="nyt4"/>  Circa 1880, the shareholders of the company disagreed over whether the lands should continue to be leased, or whether they should be re-apportioned.<ref name="nyt4"/>  In 1878, [[Robert M. Grinnell]] sued [[Edward M. Baker]] et al. for partition and division of the allotments.<ref>''Pharaoh'', 149 N.Y.S. at 440.</ref>  In ''Grinnell v. Baker'' (unreported), the court ordered the lands sold at public auction (subject to the Montauk claim), with the proceeds distributed equally among the non-Indian lessees, rather than the Montauk tribe.<ref name="nyt4"/> 

The auction took place at the home of [[Jehial Parsons]].<ref name="nyt7">John A. Strong & Philip Wyppensenwah-Rabito, More on How Montauk Was Parceled Out, ''New York Times'' letter to the editor, at LI11.</ref>   [[Arthur W. Benson]] bought the {{convert|11000|acre|km2}} at auction for $151,000 in 1879.<ref name="nyt4"/><ref name="nyt5"/>  In turn, Benson sold {{convert|5000|acre|km2}} of the land to the [[Long Island Rail Road]] for $600,000.<ref name="nyt4"/>  

Benson hired [[Nathaniel Dominey]] to negotiate the removal of the Montauks still living on the reservation.<ref name="nyt4"/>  At a later, Senate Sub-Committee hearing, Dominey testified that eight Indians remained on the reservation at the time, including:  future Chief Wyandank Pharaoh (10 years old at the time), his mother, and two of her brothers.<ref name="nyt4"/>  Later, Dominey experienced a change of heart and cooperated with the Montauks in their claim, and turning over his letters from Benson.<ref name="nyt7"/>  Dominey testified that he compensated Wyandank Pharaoh's mother with a $100 semi-annual annuity and two houses, to be inherited by Pharaoh, $80 each to her two brothers, and $10 to Wyandank.<ref name="pharaoh"/>

Arthur Benson had viewed Montauk as "his private playground"; after his death, his son approached [[Austin Corbin]], President and controlling shareholder of the [[Long Island Rail Road]], and [[Charles Pratt]], of [[Standard Oil]], about the possibility of voiding his fathers will and opening Montauk to development.<ref name="nyt7"/>  Montauk Point was purchased by Corbin and Pratt in 1895.<ref name="nyt1"/>

On October 30, 1895, Chief Wyandank Pharaoh returned from a research trip to Brooklyn and Washington, D.C. to gather evidence to pursue a claim.<ref name="nyt1">Montauks to Make a Test Case, ''New York Times'', Oct. 30, 1895, at 1.</ref>  Pharaoh declared his intentions to undertake a hunting trip on the disputed land and initiate a lawsuit if he was interfered with.<ref name="nyt1"/>

The ''New York Times'' blamed Chief Pharaoh for the dispute:
<blockquote>If King Wyandank Pharaoh of the Montauk Tribe of Indians had not given for $10 the living members of the Montauk tribe might now be wealthy, instead of being poor and fighting for their rights with a desperate hope of regaining at least part of what they claim to be their lawful heritage.<ref name="nyt4">Indians Claim Lands, ''New York Times'', Sept. 23, 1900, at 15.</ref></blockquote>

[[File:Cullen 4138870042 29c35feb8f o.jpg|thumb|right|Judge [[Edgar M. Cullen]] delivered the opinion of the Appellate Division.]]
Chief Talkhouse, on behalf of the tribe, filed suit, stating a cause of action for [[ejectment]] on February 5, 1897.<ref>Strong, 2001, at 120.</ref><ref name="nyt2"/>  For proof of tribal status, the tribe cited a partition action decided by Judge Dykman and the [[1890 United States Census]].<ref name="nyt2"/>  The complaint valued the land at approximately $300,000.<ref name="nyt2"/>

On June 5, 1897, Judge [[Wilmot Moses Smith]] of the [[New York Supreme Court]] set a hearing date for June 19 in [[Patchogue]] to hear the oral arguments for the defendants' [[demurrer]].<ref>Indians' Claim for Montauk Point, ''New York Times'', June 5, 1897, at 21.</ref> The matter was transferred to Judge [[Samuel T. Maddox]] in Brooklyn.<ref name="nyt2"/>  Judge Maddox granted the demurrer, dismissing the action but allowing the tribe to re-plead if they paid costs.<ref name="nyt2"/>

;Appellate Division
The Montauk's, represented by ex-judge [[George M. Curtis]], filed a notice of appeal on December 22, 1897.<ref name="nyt2">Indians Want the Land, ''New York Times'', Dec. 22, 1897, at 1.</ref>  Before the Appellate Division, the Montauk's case was argued by [[Leman B.

Co.'', 51 N.Y.S. 142 (App. Div. 1898).</ref>  [[Alfred A. Gardner]] argued on behalf of the LIRR, with [[William J. Kelly]] on the brief.<ref name="mtoi"/>  The Appellate Division panel consisted of Judges Goodrich, [[Edgar M. Cullen]], [[Willard Bartlett]], Hatch, and Woodward.<ref name="mtoi"/>

The Appellate Division of the Second Department unanimously affirmed the judgment of the Suffolk Special Term on April 19, 1898.<ref name="nyt3">Legal Notes:  Rights of Indian Tribes, ''New York Times'', Apr. 29, 1900, at 16.</ref>  Citing ''[[Strong v.

[[File:Bartlett 4016404287 3fc9835108 o.jpg|thumb|right|Judge [[Edward T. Bartlett]] held that neither an individual Indian nor a tribe could sue, unless authorized by state statute.]]
;Supreme Court
Eugene M. Johnson, a U.S. citizen of Montauk descent, and a member of the tribe since birth, brought a similar suit in his own name, on behalf of himself and other similarly interested.<ref name="nyt3"/>  The Special Term sustained a demurrer.<ref name="nyt3"/>  

;Appellate Division
The divided panel of the Appellate Division of the Second Department reversed on July 1, 1899.<ref name="johnson">''Johnson v. Long Island R.R. Co.'', 61 N.Y.S. 1139 (App. Div. 1899) (per curiam), rev'd, 56 N.E. 992 (N.Y. 1900).</ref><ref name="nyt3"/>  In a [[per curiam]] opinion, joined by all but Judge [[Willard Bartlett]], the Appellate Division held:
<blockquote>While the right to maintain this action in its present form is not free from doubt, still, as it is brought in accordance with the view expressed by us on the prior appeal, we think we should adhere to our former decision, and allow the question to be finally determined by the court of appeals.<ref>''Johnson'', 61 N.Y.S. at 1139 (citation omitted).</ref></blockquote> 

;Court of Appeals
The Appellate Division certified three questions to the Court of Appeals:
<blockquote>1.  Has the plaintiff in this action legal capacity to sue?<br>2.  Is there a defect of the parties plaintiff in this action, in that the members of the alleged Montauk Tribe of Indians are not made parties plaintiff?<br>3.  Does the complaint herein state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action?<ref>''Johnson'', 56 N.E. at 992.</ref></blockquote>

Before the Court of Appeals, Treadwell and Morrison again argued for the Montauks, while Gardner and Kelly again argued for the LIRR.<ref name="johnson"/>

The [[New York Court of Appeals]] reversed the Appellate Division, and affirmed the Special Term, on April 17, 1900.<ref name="nyt3"/>  The court answered all three certified questions in the negative, without costs to either party.<ref>''Johnson'', 56 N.E. at 468.</ref>  Judge [[Edward T. Bartlett]], joined by Judges [[Denis O'Brien (New York politician)|Denis O'Brien]], [[Albert Haight]], and [[Celora E. Martin]], held that Johnson had no capacity to bring a suit on the tribe's behalf.<ref name="johnson"/><ref name="nyt3"/>  The Court held that Indians, as wards of the state, had no right to sue unless conferred by statute:<ref name="nyt3"/> 
<blockquote>A decision holding that this action could be maintained either by the tribe, or an individual member thereof on behalf of himself and all others who should come in and contribute, would be contrary to the policy and practice which have been long established in our treatment of the Indian tribes. They are regarded as the wards of the state, and, generally speaking, possessed of only such rights to appear and litigate in courts of justice as are conferred upon them by statute.<ref>''Johnson'', 56 N.E. at 467-68.</ref></blockquote>

Chief Judge [[Alton B. Parker]] concurred in the result, without separate opinion; Judges [[Irving G. Vann]] and Landon dissented, without opinion.<ref name="johnson"/><ref name="nyt3"/>

{{see also|Narragansett land claim|Mohegan Indians v. Connecticut}}
[[File:FifthAvenueHotel1860 framecrop.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Fifth Avenue Hotel]], the site of the Sub-Committee hearing]] 
Chief Pharaoh, along with representatives of the [[Shinnecock Tribe]], [[Narragansett Tribe]], and [[Mohegan Tribe]], testified before a Sub-Committee of the [[Senate Indian Affairs Committee]] on September 22, 1900 at the [[Fifth Avenue Hotel]].<ref name="nyt4"/>  The Sub-Committee consisted of Senators [[John M. Thurston]] (R-NE) and [[Orville H. Platt]] (R-CT).<ref name="nyt4"/>  In addition to Pharaoh, the testifying Indians were:  Rev. [[Eugene A. Johnson]], [[Nathan J. Cuffee]], and [[James Cuffee]] (of the Montauk Council), [[John Noka]], [[Joshua Noka]], and [[Donald Seeter]] (of the Narragansett Council), [[David Kellis]] (of the Shinnecock Council).<ref name="nyt4"/>  [[Maria Cropper]] and Dr. [[William H. Johnson]] of the Montauk tribe were among the spectators.<ref name="nyt4"/>

Rev. Johnson testified that there were 300 living members of the Montauk tribe.<ref name="nyt4"/>  Johnson also testified that the New York state legislature had denied the Montauks a hearing because they were not "persons."<ref name="nyt4"/>  Johnson argued that the Montauks could not alienate property without the consent of both New York and the federal government.<ref name="nyt4"/>  He valued the disputed property at $3,000,000.<ref name="nyt4"/>

The tribes requested special legislation to allow them to bring their land claims, for fraud, in the [[United States circuit court]].<ref name="nyt4"/>  The Montauks and Shinnecocks claimed {{convert|11000|acre|km2}} of Montauk Point; the Narragansetts a eight-square-mile tract near [[Narragansett Bay]]; the Mohegans a reservation in and near [[Norwich, Connecticut]].<ref name="nyt4"/>  Tredwell and Morrison continued to represent the tribes before the hearing.<ref name="nyt4"/>

==State enabling legislation (1906)==
A bill granting the Montauks permission to sue was introduced in February 1903.<ref>Strong, 2001, at 125.</ref>  The Montauk's lawyer, [[Charles O. Maas]], was the key lobbyist for the bill.<ref name="s127"/>

On April 10, 1906, the New York legislature passed a statute enabling the Montauk tribe to bring suit,<ref>1906 N.Y. Laws, ch. 177.</ref>  The act contained the following proviso:  "the question as to the existence of the Montauk Tribe of Indians shall be a question of law and fact to be determined by the court."<ref name="s127">Strong, 2001, at 127.</ref>  Judge Blackmar interpreted the act as "providing that the act should not be construed as conferring tribal rights on any individuals, but that the question of the existence of the Montauk Tribe should be determined by the court."<ref>''Pharaoh'', 127 N.Y.S. at 1038.</ref>

[[File:Old Montauk Station & Bike Rack.JPG|thumb|right|The former [[Montauk (LIRR station)|Montauk LIRR station house]]]]
;Supreme Court
Pursuant to the enabling act, Chief Wyandank Pharaoh brought a third suit on behalf of the tribe in 1906.<ref name="nyt5"/>  The named defendants were:  [[Jane Ann Benson]] and [[Mary Benson]], the executrices of Arthur Benson's will, [[John J. Pierrepoint]] and [[Henry R. Hoyt]], the executors and trustees of [[Frank Sherman Benson]]'s will, [[Mary Benson]], the [[Montauk Company]], the [[Montauk Dock and Improvement Company]], [[Alfred W. Hoyt]], the [[Montauk Extension Railroad Company]], and the [[Long Island Rail Road]].<ref name="nyt5"/> An area of {{convert|4200|acre|km2}} was named in the third complaint ({{convert|1200|acre|km2}} of it adjacent to the LIRR).<ref name="pharaoh"/><ref name="nyt5"/>

Chief Pharaoh was represented by Maas and [[Lawrence W. Trowbridge]] ([[of counsel]]).<ref name="nyt5"/>  The defendants were represented by [[Daly, Hoyt & Mason]] (for the Bensons), [[Austin & McLanahan]] (for the Dock and Improvement Co.), [[A. T. Mason]] (for Pierrepoint and Henry Hoyt), [[P. Tecumseh Sherman]] (for Alfred Hoyt), and [[Joseph Keany]] (for the LIRR).<ref name="pharaoh"/><ref name="nyt5"/>  According to a 1910 Q&A in the ''New York Times'', the lawyers fees were "long since supposed to have eclipsed the value of the land in litigation."<ref name="nyt6">Queries and Answers, ''New York Times'', Nov. 6, 1910, at X11.</ref> 

The trial took place, without a jury, before Judge [[Abel Blackmar]] of the Supreme Court of Suffolk County, Special Term.<ref name="s128">Strong, 2001, at 128.</ref> Fourteen of the sixteen living Montauk men appeared as witnesses at trial.<ref name="nyt5"/>

Judge Blackmar, ruled against the Montauks on October 11, 1910.<ref name="nyt5">Indians Can't Get Lands, ''New York Times'', Oct. 12, 1910, at 6.</ref> According to Blackmar, the Montauks individually conveyed all their lands and claims to Arthur Benson between 1885 and 1894, in exchange for $100 to $250 each, except for Wyandank Pharaoh who received only $10, plus between {{convert|5|and|45|acre|m2}} in [[Freetown]] and [[East Hampton (village), New York|East Hampton]], plus a $240 annuity to be divided per capita.<ref name="nyt5"/>

Judge Blackmar also relied upon a December 1686 patent granted by Governor [[Thomas Dongan]] to the freeholders of East Hampton, granting them the exclusive right to purchase Indian lands in the area.<ref name="nyt5"/>  Benson had separately purchased the fee rights from the descendants of the patentees.<ref name="nyt5"/>

Judge Blackmar also held that the Montauks were no longer a tribe:<ref name="nyt6"/>
<blockquote>During this long period the number of the Indians was greatly reduced. Their blood became so mixed that in many of them Indian traits were obliterated. They had no internal government, and they lived a sort of shiftless life, hunting, fishing, cultivating the ground 'Indian fashion' as a witness called it, and often leaving for long periods and working in some menial capacity for the whites.<ref>''Pharaoh'', 126 N.Y.S. at 1037-38.</ref></blockquote>

;Appellate Division
On appeal, the Montauks found a new lawyer: [[Allen Caruthers]].<ref>Strong, 2001, at 141.</ref>

The Appellate Division&mdash;composed of Judges Jenks, Burr, Rich, Stapleton, and Putnam&mdash;affirmed on October 16, 1914.<ref name="pharaoh"/> On appeal, the Montauks were represented by Allen Caruthers, while the defendants were represented by [[Charles K. Carpenter]], with [[Alexander T. Mason]] and [[George T. Austin]] on the brief.<ref name="pharaoh"/>  Judge Burr, for a unanimous court, wrote the opinion.<ref name="pharaoh"/>

The Court of Appeals&mdash;composed of Chief Judge [[Frank Harris Hiscock]] and Judges [[Emory A. Chase]], [[Frederick Collin]], [[William Herman Cuddeback]], [[John W.

===Federal lobbying===
Maas departed for Washington, D.C. after the passage of the state enabling legislation.<ref name="s127"/>  The Interior Department endorsed the idea on July 7, 1906.<ref name="s127"/>

In January 1921, Senator [[James Wolcott Wadsworth, Jr.]] (R-NY) and Representative [[Homer P. Snyder]] (R-NY) introduced legislation and asked the Interior Secretary to report to Congress on the Montauk's tribal status and the merits of their land claim.<ref>Strong, 2001, at 147-48.</ref>  The Secretary prepared a report agreeing with the conclusions of Judge Blackmar and the New York appellate courts in ''Pharaoh v. Benson''.<ref>Strong, 2001, at 150-52.</ref>  The [[Senate Committee on Indian Affairs]] received the report on April 22, 1922 and introduced the Wadsworth bill that June; the bill did not make it out of committee.<ref>Strong, 2001, at 152.</ref>

In 1996, represented by [[Bell, Boyd & Lloyd]], the Montauks filed a letter of intent with the Branch of Acknowledgement and Research of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the first step towards federal recognition.<ref>Strong, 2001, at 167.</ref>  The petition for recognition was submitted on June 23, 1998.<ref>Strong, 2001, at 174.</ref>  The tribe received a request for documents from the BIA in January 1999.<ref>Strong, 2001, at 174-75.</ref>

===State lobbying===
On February 14, 1922, New York state assemblyman [[John J. O'Connor]] introduced legislation to compensate the Montauks.<ref>Strong, 2001, at 149-50.</ref>  The bill excluded [[James Waters]] and the other members of the Montauk diaspora.<ref name="s150">Strong, 2001, at 150.</ref>  The bill would have created a three person committee&mdash;composed to two assembly members and one state senator&mdash;to determine whether the land claim had been meritorious.<ref name="s150"/>  The bill never reached the floor.<ref name="s150"/>

===Montaukett burial grounds===
In 1983, Fort Hill Associates and Signal Hill Associates applied to the town of East Hampton for a permit to build homes on North Neck hill, above the Montauk's ancestral burial ground.<ref name="s160">Strong, 2001, at 160.</ref>  As quoted in the ''New York Times'', the East Hampton town supervisor said, "Who cares about a bunch of dead Indians?"<ref name="s160"/>  The Montauketts won a temporary injunction in court that July.<ref name="s160"/>  That November, the town board voted to purchase the {{convert|30|acre|m2}} for $1.4 million and preserve the burial ground.<ref name="s160"/>

In 1989, developers announced plans touching on a different Montaukett burial ground in North Neck.<ref name="s162"/>  After protests, the town government agreed to preserve the site in 1991.<ref>Strong, 2001, at 163.</ref>
