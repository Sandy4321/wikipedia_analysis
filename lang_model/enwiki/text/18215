The '''''R<U+00E9>publique'' class''' was a pair of [[pre-dreadnought]] [[battleship]]s of the [[French Navy]]; the ships were [[French battleship R<U+00E9>publique|''R<U+00E9>publique'']], the [[lead ship]], and [[French battleship Patrie|''Patrie'']]. Built between 1901 and December 1906, they were actually completed at the same time as the British {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, the revolutionary design of which rendered the French ships obsolete before they entered service. Nevertheless, the design for ''R<U+00E9>publique'' and ''Patrie'' corrected many of the problems in earlier French battleships.

''R<U+00E9>publique'' and ''Patrie'' served in the Mediterranean Fleet for the duration of their careers, including the entirety of [[World War I]]. They saw action at the [[Battle of Antivari]] in August 1914 and spent most of 1914<U+2013>15 [[blockade|blockading]] the [[Straits of Otranto]] to prevent [[Austro-Hungarian]] warships from breaking out into the Mediterranean. They both contributed some of their crews to the [[Noemvriana|attempt to ensure Greek acquiescence]] to [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Allied operations in Macedonia]] in [[Athens]] in late 1916. They spent the rest of the war based in Athens or [[Salonica]]. After the end of the war, ''R<U+00E9>publique'' was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] in 1919, disarmed in 1920 and sold for [[ship breaking|scrapping]] in 1921; ''Patrie'' was placed in reserve as well in 1919 and served as a [[training ship]] from 1920, until she was stricken in 1927 and she too was sold to the ship-breakers in 1928.

==Design==
''R<U+00E9>publique'' and ''Patrie'' were authorized in the Fleet Law of 1900, which also called for four additional battleships, which were to be the similar {{sclass|Libert<U+00E9>|battleship|4}}.<ref>Ropp, p. 329</ref> The new battleship design corrected many of the defects in earlier battleships, which was accomplished through increases in the displacement and [[beam (nautical)|beam]]. They also had a significantly reduced [[tumblehome]] compared to earlier French battleships.<ref name=G297>Gardiner, p. 297</ref>

===General characteristics and machinery===
[[File:R<U+00E9>publique class diagrams Brasseys 1906.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1906</center>]]
The ships were {{convert|133.81|m|sp=us|ftin}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|24.26|m|abbr=on|ftin}} and a full-load [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|8.41|m|abbr=on|ftin}}. ''R<U+00E9>publique'' [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|14605|MT|sp=us}} at full load, and ''Patrie'' displaced slightly more, {{convert|14900|MT|sp=us}} at full load. The ships were built with a tall [[forecastle]] deck that extended all the way to the [[Mast (sailing)|mainmast]]. ''R<U+00E9>publique'' and ''Patrie'' retained a small fighting mast for the foremast, but had a lighter pole mast for the mainmast. They had a crew of between 766 and 825 officers and enlisted men. The ships had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|1.1|m|abbr=on}}, and were equipped with [[bilge keel]]s to increase their stability.<ref name=G297/>

The ships were powered by three 4-cylinder vertical [[triple expansion engine]]s with twenty-four [[Niclausse boiler]]s. The boilers were divided into three boiler rooms, each of which were trunked into their own [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]. They were rated at {{convert|18000|ihp|lk=in}} and provided a top speed of {{convert|19|kn|lk=in}}. The ships were equipped with four [[electric generator]]s that had a combined output of 1,000&nbsp;[[Ampere|amps]] at 83&nbsp;[[volt]]s. Coal storage amounted to {{convert|1850|MT|abbr=on}}. At an economical cruising speed of {{convert|10|kn|abbr=on}}, the ships could steam for {{convert|8500|nmi|lk=in}}.<ref name=P302>Peltier, p. 302</ref>

===Armament and armor===
The main battery for the ''R<U+00E9>publique''-class ships consisted of four [[Canon de 305 mm Mod<U+00E8>le 1893/96 gun]]s mounted in two twin [[gun turret]]s, one forward and one aft. The secondary battery consisted of eighteen [[Canon de 164 mm Mod<U+00E8>le 1893]] guns; twelve were mounted in twin turrets, and six in [[casemate]]s in the hull. She also carried twenty-five 3-pounder guns. The ship was also armed with two {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s submerged in the hull.<ref name=G297/>

The ships' [[belt armor|main belt]] was {{convert|280|mm|abbr=on|1}} thick at the [[waterline]] and extended for almost the complete length of the hull, from the bow to near the stern. The belt was reduced to {{convert|240|mm|abbr=on}} on the top edge and {{convert|81|mm|abbr=on}} on the bottom. On the bow and stern, the thicknesses were reduced to {{convert|180|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|140|mm|abbr=on}}, and 81&nbsp;mm, respectively. The armored deck was {{convert|53|mm|abbr=on}} thick [[amidships]], and increased to {{convert|70|mm|abbr=on}}  on the slopes that connected to the belt. The main battery was protected by up to {{convert|350|mm|abbr=on|1}} of armor, and had bases with {{convert|254|mm|abbr=on}} thick armor plate. The secondary turrets had {{convert|150|mm|abbr=on}} thick faces and 280&nbsp;mm thick back plates to balance the turrets, and the casemate guns were protected with 140&nbsp;mm of armor. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|305|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides.<ref name=G297/>

==History==
[[File:Battleship Republique illustration.png|thumb|Illustration of ''R<U+00E9>publique'']]

''R<U+00E9>publique'' was laid down in December 1901, at the [[Arsenal de Brest]] shipyard. She was launched on 4 September 1902 and after completing [[fitting out]], was commissioned into the French Navy in December 1906. ''Patrie'' was built by the [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la M<U+00E9>diterran<U+00E9>e|La Seyne shipyard]] in [[Toulon]]. She was laid down on 1 April 1902, launched 17 December 1903, and commissioned in December 1906.<ref name=G297/> The ships were completed at the same time as the revolutionary British battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}; her design, which incorporated a uniform large-caliber main battery and high-speed [[steam turbine]]s, rendered all other [[pre-dreadnought]]s like the ''R<U+00E9>publique'' class obsolete.<ref>Gardiner, p. 21</ref>

''R<U+00E9>publique'' and ''Patrie'' spent their careers in the French [[Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean (France)|Mediterranean Fleet]], and were involved in several accidents. While ''Patrie'' was still conducting [[sea trials]] on 29 May 1907, a condenser pipe in one of her boilers burst. Several stokers were scalded, and the ship had to return to [[Toulon]] to have the condenser pipe replaced.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9F06E4D91E30E233A25753C3A9639C946697D6CF|title=French warship damaged|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 May 1907|accessdate=13 July 2012}}</ref> In February 1910, ''Patrie'' accidentally launched a torpedo that hit ''R<U+00E9>publique'', though the damage was not serious.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9404E1DE1430E233A25754C1A9649C946196D6CF|title=Torpedoing report|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 February 1910|accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref> In Toulon in September 1911, the battleship [[French battleship Libert<U+00E9>|''Libert<U+00E9>'']] blew up from badly decomposed propellant charges; a large piece of her armor plate struck ''R<U+00E9>publique'', which was moored nearby.<ref>Alger, p. 1458</ref>

Both ships were in the Second Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet at the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914.<ref>Guernsey, p. 179</ref> They participated in the [[Battle of Antivari]] in mid-August and unsuccessfully attempted to lure out the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet.<ref>Sondhaus, pp. 258<U+2013>259</ref><ref>Halpern, p. 4</ref> They spent the early part of the war based at [[Corfu]], [[Pylos|Navarino]] and [[Malta]], to keep the Austro-Hungarians bottled up in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. In 1916 the ships supported Allied operations in Salonica and also detached landing parties to support the Allied attempt to force Greek acquiescence for those operations in Athens on 1 December. They spent the rest of the war at Salonica and Athens. ''Patrie'' became flagship of the French squadron at Salonica in 1918. After the end of the war, both ships were placed in reserve in 1919.<ref name=g12>Gille, pp. 112<U+2013>13</ref> ''R<U+00E9>publique'' was disarmed in 1920 and stricken from the [[naval register]] in 1921 and subsequently broken up for scrap.<ref name=G297/> ''Patrie'' was retained longer, serving as a training ship in Toulon for mechanics and torpedomen until 1927, when she too was stricken and sold for scrap.<ref name=g12/>
