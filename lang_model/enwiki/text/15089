'''Grand Teton National Park''' is a [[United States National Park]] in northwestern [[Wyoming]]. Approximately {{convert|310000|acre}} in size, the park includes the major peaks of the {{convert|40|mi|adj=on}} long [[Teton Range]] as well as most of the northern sections of the valley known as [[Jackson Hole]]. Only {{convert|10|mi}} south of [[Yellowstone National Park]], the two parks are connected by the [[National Park Service]] managed [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway]]. These three protected areas in conjunction with surrounding [[United States National Forest|National Forests]] constitute the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem]], which at almost {{convert|18000000|acre}}, is one of the largest intact mid-latitude temperate ecosystems in the world.

Human history of the Grand Teton region dates back at least 11,000&nbsp;years, when the first nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]] [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]]s would migrate into the region during warmer months in pursuit of food and supplies. In the early 19th-century, the first [[White American|Caucasian]] explorers encountered the eastern [[Shoshone people|Shoshone]] [[Native Americans in the United States|natives]]. Between 1810 and 1840, the region attracted fur trading companies that vied for control of the lucrative beaver fur trade. U.S. Government expeditions to the region commenced in the mid 19th-century as an offshoot of exploration in Yellowstone, and the first permanent white settlers in Jackson Hole arrived in the 1880s. Efforts to preserve the region as a national park commenced in the late 19th-century and in 1929, Grand Teton National Park was established, protecting the major peaks of the Teton Range. The valley of Jackson Hole remained in private ownership until the 1930s, when conservationists led by [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] began purchasing land in Jackson Hole to be added to the existing national park. Against public opinion and with repeated [[United States Congress|congressional]] efforts to repeal the measures, much of Jackson Hole was set aside for protection as [[Jackson Hole National Monument]] in 1943. The monument was abolished in 1950 and most of the monument land was added to Grand Teton National Park.

Grand Teton National Park is named for [[Grand Teton]], the tallest mountain in the Teton Range. The naming of the mountains is attributed to early 19th-century [[French language|French]] speaking trappers<U+2014>"les trois tetons" (the three breasts) was later anglicized and shortened to ''Tetons''. At {{convert|13775|ft}}, Grand Teton abruptly rises more than {{convert|7000|ft}} above Jackson Hole, almost {{convert|850|ft}} higher than [[Mount Owen (Wyoming)|Mount Owen]], the second highest summit in the range. The park has numerous lakes, including {{convert|15|mi|adj=on}} long [[Jackson Lake]] as well as streams of varying length and the upper mainstem of the [[Snake River]]. Though in a state of recession, a dozen small glaciers persist at the higher elevations near the highest peaks in the range. Some of the rocks in the park are the oldest found in any U.S. National Park and have been dated at nearly 2.7&nbsp;billion years.

Grand Teton National Park is an almost pristine ecosystem and the same species of flora and fauna that have existed since prehistoric times can still be found there. More than 1000&nbsp;species of [[vascular plants]], dozens of species of mammals, 300 species of birds, more than a dozen fish species and a few species of reptiles and amphibians exist. Due to various changes in the ecosystem, some that are human-induced, efforts have been made to provide enhanced protection to some species of native fish and the increasingly threatened [[Whitebark Pine]]. Grand Teton National Park is a popular destination for mountaineering, hiking, fishing and other forms of recreation. There are more than 1000&nbsp;drive-in campsites and over {{convert|200|mi}} of hiking trails that provide access to [[backcountry]] camping areas. Noted for world-renowned trout fishing, the park is one of the few places to catch [[Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout]]. Grand Teton has several visitor centers that are managed by the National Park Service and [[concession (contract)|concessionaire]] managed facilities which operate motels, lodges, gas stations and marinas.

=== Fur trade exploration ===
The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] (1804<U+2013>1806) passed well north of the Grand Teton region. During their return trip from the [[Pacific Ocean]], expedition member [[John Colter]] was given an early discharge so he could join two [[fur]] trappers who were heading west in search of beaver pelts. Colter was later hired by [[Manuel Lisa]] to lead fur trappers and to explore the region around the [[Yellowstone River]]. During the winter of 1807/08 Colter passed through Jackson Hole and was the first Caucasian to see the Teton Range.<ref name=harris>{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Burton|title=John Colter, His Years in the Rockies|date=March 1, 1993|publisher=Bison Books|isbn=978-0-8032-7264-4|pages=73<U+2013>113|url=http://www.amazon.com/John-Colter-His-Years-Rockies/dp/0803272642#reader_0803272642|accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref> Lewis and Clark expedition co-leader [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] produced a map based on the previous expedition and included the explorations of John Colter in 1807, apparently based on discussions between Clark and Colter when the two met in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in 1810.<ref name=mattes>{{cite web|last=Mattes|first=Merrrill|title=John Colter, the Phantom Explorer<U+2014>1807-1808|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/grte1/chap3.htm|work=Colter's Hell and Jackson's Hole|publisher=Grand Teton Natural History Association|accessdate=2012-01-14|date=March 5, 2004}}</ref> Another map attributed to William Clark indicates John Colter entered Jackson Hole from the northeast, crossing the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] at either [[Togwotee Pass]] or [[Union Pass]] and left the region after crossing Teton Pass, following the well established Native American trails.<ref name=daugherty>{{cite web|last=Daugherty|first=John|title=The Fur Trappers|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/grte2/hrs3.htm|work=A Place Called Jackson Hole|publisher=Grand Teton Natural History Association|accessdate=2012-01-14|date=July 24, 2004}}</ref> In 1931, the [[Colter Stone]], a rock carved in the shape of a head with the inscription "John Colter" on one side and the year "1808" on the other, was discovered in a field in [[Tetonia, Idaho]], which is west of Teton Pass.

[[File:Colter Stone.jpg|thumb|right|The enigmatic Colter Stone, with the inscription "John Colter", was found in a field in eastern Idaho in 1931.]]
John Colter is widely considered the first [[mountain man]] and, like those that came to the Jackson Hole region over the next 30&nbsp;years, he was there primarily for the profitable fur trapping; the region was rich with the highly sought after pelts of [[beaver]] and other fur bearing animals. Between 1810 and 1812, the [[Astorians]] traveled through Jackson Hole and crossed Teton Pass as they headed east in 1812.<ref name=kelsey>{{cite book|last=Kelsey|first=Joe|title=Climbing and hiking in the Wind River Mountains|year=January 1994|publisher=Pequot Press|isbn=0-934641-70-6|page=56|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fEz0T7HOJZsC&pg=PA56&dq=astorians+crossed+teton+pass#v=onepage&q=astorians%20crossed%20teton%20pass&f=false|accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref> After 1810, American and British fur trading companies were in competition for control of the [[North American fur trade]], and American sovereignty over the region was not secured until the signing of the [[Oregon Treaty]] in 1846. One party employed by the British [[North West Company]] and led by explorer [[Donald Mackenzie (explorer)|Donald Mackenzie]] entered Jackson Hole from the west in 1818 or 1819. The Tetons, as well as the valley west of the Teton Range known today as [[Pierre's Hole]], may have been named by French speaking [[Iroquois]] or [[French Canadian]] trappers that were part of Mackenzie's party.<ref name=mattes2>{{cite web|last=Mattes|first=Merrrill|title=Le Trois Tetons: The Golden Age of Discovery, 1810-1824|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/grte1/chap5.htm|work=Colter's Hell and Jackson's Hole|publisher=Grand Teton Natural History Association|accessdate=2012-01-14|date=March 5, 2004}}</ref> Earlier parties had referred to the most prominent peaks of the Teton Range as the Pilot Knobs.

Formed in the mid 1820s, the [[Rocky Mountain Fur Company]] partnership included [[Jedediah Smith]], [[William Sublette]] and [[David Edward Jackson]] or "Davey Jackson". Jackson oversaw the trapping operations in the Teton region between 1826 and 1830. Sublette named the valley east of the Teton Range "Jackson's Hole" (later simply Jackson Hole) for Davey Jackson.<ref name=daugherty/><ref name=hafen>{{cite book|last=Hafen|first=LeRoy R.|title=Trappers of the Far West: Sixteen Biographical Sketches|date=October 1, 1983|publisher=Bison Books|isbn=978-0-8032-7218-7|page=85|accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref> As the demand for beaver fur declined and the various regions of the American West became depleted of beaver due to [[Animal trapping|over trapping]], American fur trading companies folded; however, individual mountain men continued to trap beaver in the region until about 1840.<ref name=daugherty/> From the mid 1840s until 1860, Jackson Hole and the Teton Range were generally devoid of all but the small populations of Native American tribes that had already been there. Most overland human migration routes such as the [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]] and [[Mormon Trail]]s crossed over [[South Pass]], well to the south of the Teton Range, and Caucasian influence in the Teton region was minimal until the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]] commenced organized explorations.<ref name=daugherty/>

=== History of mountaineering ===
[[File:Shive Spalding and Petersen on top of Grand Teton 1898.jpg|thumb|right|In this image taken by William O. Owen in 1898, his climbing partners John Shive, Franklin Spalding, and Frank Petersen are depicted on top of Grand Teton.]]
During the last 25&nbsp;years of the 19th century, the mountains of the Teton Range became a focal point for explorers wanting to claim first ascents of the peaks. However, white explorers may not have been the first to climb many of the peaks and the earliest first ascent of even the formidable Grand Teton itself might have been achieved long before written history documented it. Native American relics remain including ''The Enclosure'', an obviously man-made structure that is located about {{convert|530|ft|abbr=on}} below the summit of Grand Teton at a point near the Upper Saddle ({{convert|13160|ft|abbr=on}}).<ref name=rossiter2>{{cite book|last=Rossiter|first=Richard|title=Teton Classics: 50 Selected Climbs in Grand Teton National Park|date=January 1, 1994|publisher=Falcon Guides|isbn=0-934641-71-4|edition=2nd|accessdate=2012-03-09|page=30}}</ref><ref name=bonney>{{cite book|last=Bonney|first=Orrin H.|title=The Grand Controversy|year=May 2000|publisher=American Alpine Club|isbn=978-0-930410-45-2|coauthors=Lorraine G.

Langford]] and James Stevenson, both members of the Hayden Geological Survey of 1872, found The Enclosure during their early attempt to summit Grand Teton. Langford claimed that he and Stevenson climbed Grand Teton, but were vague as to whether they had made it to the summit. Their reported obstacles and sightings were never corroborated by later parties. Langford and Stevenson likely did not get much further than The Enclosure.<ref name=jackson/> The first ascent of Grand Teton that is substantiated was made by [[William O. Owen]], Frank Petersen, John Shive and [[Franklin Spencer Spalding]] on August 11, 1898.<ref name=rossiter2/> Owen had made two previous attempts on the peak and after publishing several accounts of this first ascent, discredited any claim that Langford and Stevenson had ever reached beyond The Enclosure in 1872. The disagreement over which party first reached the top of Grand Teton may be the greatest controversy in the history of American mountaineering.<ref name=jackson/> After 1898 no other ascents of Grand Teton were recorded until 1923.<ref name=ortenburger>{{cite book|last=Ortenburger|first=Leigh N.|title=A climber's guide to the Teton Range|year=Nov 1, 1996|publisher=Mountaineers Books|isbn=0-89886-480-1|page=30|coauthors=Reynold G.

By the mid 1930s, more than a dozen different climbing routes had been established on Grand Teton including the northeast ridge in 1931 by [[Glenn Exum]]. Glenn Exum teamed up with another noted climber named [[Paul Petzoldt]] to found the [[Exum Mountain Guides]] in 1931.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Bruce|title=Outdoor leadership: theory and practice|date=January 10, 2006|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-5731-8|page=16|accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref> Of the other major peaks on the Teton Range, all were climbed by the late 1930s including Mount Moran in 1922 and Mount Owen in 1930 by [[Fritiof Fryxell]] and others after numerous previous attempts had failed.<ref name=ortenburger/> Both [[Middle Teton|Middle]] and [[South Teton]] were first climbed on the same day, August 29, 1923, by a group of climbers led by [[Albert R. Ellingwood]].<ref name=ortenburger/> New routes on the peaks were explored as safety equipment and skills improved and eventually climbs rated at above 5.9 on the [[Yosemite Decimal System]] difficulty scale were established on Grand Teton. The classic climb following the route first pioneered by Owen, known as the [[Owen-Spalding route]], is rated at 5.4 due a combination of concerns beyond the gradient alone.<ref name=jackson/> [[Rock climbing]] and [[bouldering]] had become popular in the park by the mid 20th century. In the late 1950s, gymnast [[John Gill (climber)|John Gill]] came to the park and started climbing large boulders near Jenny Lake.

While the flora of Grand Teton National Park is generally healthy, the Whitebark Pine, and to a lesser degree the Lodgepole Pine, are considered at risk.

=== Climate ===
Grand Teton National Park has a semi-arid climate with the wettest months between November and January, mostly in the form of snow. The park averages {{convert|450|in|cm}} of snow in the mountains and {{convert|191|in|cm}} in the valley annually. In January, the daily temperature range averages between {{convert|26|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}} during the day to {{convert|1|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}} at night. During the month of July, the daily temperature range is {{convert|80|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}} and {{convert|41|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}}. The record high is {{convert|93|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}} and the record low is {{convert|-66|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}}. Temperatures above the valley in the mountains during the summer average 1 degree cooler for every {{convert|1000|ft|abbr=on}} of altitude gained, so high altitude passes may remain snow covered until mid-July.<ref>{{cite web|title=Weather|url=http://www.nps.gov/grte/naturescience/weather.htm|work=Nature and Science: Environmental Factors|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2012-02-04|date=December 7, 2011}}</ref> Thunderstorms are common during the summer, especially over the mountains; by contrast, no [[tornado]]s have ever been reported within the park.

=== Air and water quality ===
Grand Teton National Park is more than {{convert|100|mi|abbr=on}} air distance from any major urban or industrial area, and localized human activities have generally had a very low environmental impact on the surrounding region. However, levels of [[ammonium]] and [[nitrogen]] have been trending slightly upwards due to deposition from rain and snow that is believed to originate from regional agricultural activities.<ref name=air>{{cite web|title=Air Pollution Impacts|url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/air/permits/aris/grte/impacts.cfm?tab=1#TabbedPanels1|work=Air resources|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2012-04-01|date=June 14, 2011}}</ref> Additionally, there has also been a slight increase in [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and pesticides that have been detected in snow and some alpine lakes.<ref name=air/> Ozone and haze may be impacting overall visibility levels.<ref name=air/> Grand Teton National Park, in partnership with other agencies, erected the first air quality monitoring station in the park in 2011.

All campsites accessible only on foot or by horseback are considered backcountry campsites and they are available by permit only, but camping is allowed in most of these backcountry zones year-round. The National Park Service has a combination of specific sites and zones for backcountry camping with a set carrying capacity of overnight stays per zone to protect the resources from overcrowding.<ref name=back/> Open fires are not permitted in the backcountry and all food must be stored in an Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee approved [[Bear-resistant food storage container|bear-resistant container]].<ref name=back/> As of 2012, only four brands of bear-resistant containers had been approved for use in the Grand Teton National Park backcountry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bears and Backcountry Food Storage|url=http://www.nps.gov/grte/planyourvisit/bears_bc.htm|work=Plan Your Visit|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2012-03-10|date=January 19, 2012}}</ref> Additionally, hikers may use an approved [[bear spray]] to elude aggressive bears.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carry Bear Spray&nbsp;<U+2014> Know How to Use It|url=http://www.nps.gov/grte/planyourvisit/bear_spray.htm|work=Bear Safety|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2012-03-10|date=December 6, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Grand Teton NP new VC GTNP1.jpg|thumb|right|Craig Thomas Discovery & Visitor Center in Moose, Wyoming]]
The [[Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center]] adjacent to the park headquarters at Moose, Wyoming, is open year round. Opened in 2007 to replace an old and inadequate visitor center, the Craig Thomas facility was built with a combination of federal grants and private donations. Fund raising efforts for an adjoining 154 seat auditorium were nearing completion as of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Visitor Center|url=http://www.gtnpf.org/projects.php|publisher=Grand Teton National Park Foundation|accessdate=2012-02-04|year=2010}}</ref> To the north at [[Colter Bay Village]] on Jackson Lake, the Colter Bay Visitor Center & Indian Arts Museum is open from the beginning of May to the early October. The Colter Bay Visitor Center & Indian Arts Museum has housed the David T. Vernon Indian Arts Exhibit since 1972.
