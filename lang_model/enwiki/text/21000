He is a cousin to [[Pauline Small]], the first woman elected to the [[Crow Nation|Crow Tribe of Indians]]. His step-grandfather, [[White Man Runs Him]], was a scout for [[George Armstrong Custer]] and an eyewitness to the battle<ref name="Ken Burn<U+2019>s The War">[http://www.pbs.org/thewar/detail_5177.htm Ken Burn<U+2019>s <U+201C>The War<U+201D>]</ref>. He grew up hearing stories of the momentous event.  The first member of his tribe to attend college, his graduate studies were interrupted by [[World War II]].

==World War II and becoming the last war chief of the Crow Tribe==
Joseph Medicine Crow joined the army, becoming a scout in the [[103rd Infantry Division (United States)|103rd Infantry Division]].  Whenever he went into battle, he wore his war paint beneath his uniform and a sacred eagle feather beneath his helmet. <ref name="Ken Burn<U+2019>s The War"/> Medicine Crow completed all four tasks required to become a war chief.
He touched a living enemy soldier (1) and disarmed an enemy (2) when he turned a corner and found himself face to face with a young German soldier:
{{cquote|The collision knocked the German's weapon to the ground. Mr. Crow lowered his own weapon and the two fought hand-to-hand. In the end Mr. Crow got the best of the German, grabbing him by the neck and choking him. He was going to kill the German soldier on the spot when the man screamed out "momma." Mr. Crow then let him go.<ref name="Ken Burn<U+2019>s The War"/>}}
He also led a successful war party (3) and stole an enemy horse (4), making a midnight raid to steal the horses from a battalion of German officers (as he rode off, he sang a traditional Crow honor song.)  He is the last member of the Crow tribe to become a war chief. <ref name="Ken Burn<U+2019>s The War"/>
