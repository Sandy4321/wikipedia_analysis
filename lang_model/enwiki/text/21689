The '''A. Murray MacKay Bridge''' is the second [[suspension bridge]] linking the [[Halifax Peninsula]] with [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]] and opened on [[July 10]], [[1970]].

The bridge is named after [[Alexander Murray MacKay]], chairman of the [[Halifax-Dartmouth Bridge Commission]] from 1951-1971 and past chief executive officer of [[Maritime Telephone and Telegraph|MT&T]].  MacKay was instrumental in having both the [[Angus L. Macdonald Bridge]] and his namesake structure built during his tenure at the commission.

During the 1970s, many residents of Halifax and Dartmouth took to nicknaming the structure "the new bridge."  Following the death of former Nova Scotia premier [[Robert L. Stanfield]] in 2004, there was a motion made to rename the MacKay Bridge to honour Stanfield (in 2007 the [[Halifax International Airport]] was renamed to [[Halifax Stanfield International Airport]], and several new schools/institutions being built are being considered for the Stanfield name), however the Stanfield family did not want any current structures already named for persons to be changed for Stanfield's sake.

The [[bridge]] carries [[Nova Scotia Highway 111|Highway 111]], informally known as the Dartmouth "Circumferential Highway," across the northwestern end of "The Narrows" of Halifax Harbour.  The epicentre of the [[Halifax Explosion]] in [[1917]] is several hundred metres southeast of the structure near the Richmond shoreline.

A major political controversy preceded construction of the MacKay Bridge when the city of Halifax expropriated residents from the community of [[Africville, Nova Scotia|Africville]] near the Halifax abutment.  New highway interchanges were built with the northern end of Barrington Street ([[Nova Scotia Trunk 3|Trunk 3]]), and an extension of Robie Street and the Bedford Highway ([[Nova Scotia Trunk 2|Trunk 2]]), as well as realignments of [[Nova Scotia Highway 102|Highway 102]] and Bayers Road.  Some [[Canadian National Railway|CN]] railway trackage in the area also had to be realigned.

The building of the MacKay Bridge, along with Highway 111, initiated a development boom in Dartmouth which eclipsed that created by the MacDonald Bridge during the 1950s and 1960s.  The [[Burnside Business Park]], the [[Mic Mac Mall]] shopping centre, and several residential developments in the [[Albro Lake, Nova Scotia|Albro Lake]] neighbourhood in [[North End, Dartmouth|Dartmouth's north end]] during the 1970s can be directly attributed to the bridge's construction.

The entire bridge measures 1.2 [[kilometre]]s (3,960 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]]) with the total of all suspended spans being 739.9 metres (2,440 feet) in length, carrying 4 traffic lanes with posted speed limits of 70 km/h (45 mph).  [[Pedestrians]] and [[bicycles]] are not permitted on the MacKay Bridge; they may use dedicated lanes on the Macdonald Bridge instead.

[[As of 2007]], the bridge charges a toll (75<U+00A2>, 60<U+00A2> with a token or MACPASS electronic toll system) to cross for regular passenger vehicles. Larger vehicles have higher tolls proportional to the number of axles. The Halifax-Dartmouth Bridge Commission is exploring the idea of moving entirely to electronic tolls to avoid handling tokens or cash.  The MacKay Bridge is the only harbour bridge which permits semi-trailers and large trucks.
