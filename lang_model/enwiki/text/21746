'''Francis A. Schaeffer''' ([[30 January]] [[1912]]&ndash;[[15 May]] [[1984]]), an American [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[theology|theologian]], [[christian philosophy|philosopher]], and [[Bible Presbyterian Church|Presbyterian]] pastor, is most famous for his writings and his establishment of the [[L'Abri|L'Abri community]] in [[Switzerland]]. Opposed to [[Modernist Christianity|theological modernism]], Schaeffer promoted an orthodox [[Protestant]] faith and a [[presuppositional apologetics|presuppositional]] approach to [[Christian apologetics]], which he believed would answer the questions of the age. A number of scholars credit his ideas with helping spark the rise of the Christian Right in the United States. Dr. Schaeffer is also the father of the author [[Frank Schaeffer]]. 

==Education and Early Career==
Schaeffer grew up in [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown, Pennsylvania]].

In [[1935]], Schaeffer graduated [[Latin honors|''magna cum laude'']] from [[Hampden-Sydney College]].  The same year he married Edith Seville, the daughter of [[missionary]] parents who had been with [[China Inland Mission]] founded by [[Hudson Taylor]].  Schaeffer then enrolled at [[Westminster Theological Seminary]] in the fall and studied under [[Cornelius Van Til]] ([[presuppositional apologetics]]) and [[John Gresham Machen|J. Gresham Machen]] ([[Biblical Inerrancy|doctrine of inerrancy]]).

In [[1937]], Schaeffer transferred to Faith Theological Seminary, graduating in [[1938]]. This seminary was newly formed as a result of a split in the Presbyterian Church of America (now the [[Orthodox Presbyterian Church]]) and the [[Bible Presbyterian Church]], a [[Presbyterian]] denomination more identified with [[Fundamentalist Christianity]] and [[premillennialism]]. Schaeffer was the first student to graduate and the first to be ordained in the Bible Presbyterian Church.  He served pastorates in [[Pennsylvania]] ([[Grove City, Pennsylvania|Grove City]] and [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]]) and [[St. Louis, Missouri]].

In [[1948]], the Schaeffer family moved to Switzerland and in [[1955]] established the community called ''L'Abri'' (French for "the shelter"). <ref> [http://www.pcahistory.org/findingaids/schaeffer/index.html  Biographical Sketch], in ''Francis August Schaeffer Papers'' section, at PCA Historical Center.

In [[1954]], Schaeffer was awarded the honorary [[Doctor of Divinity]] degree from Highland College in [[Long Beach, California]]. 

In [[1971]], Schaeffer received the honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] degree from [[Gordon College (Massachusetts)|Gordon College]] in [[Wenham, Massachusetts]].

In [[1982]], [[John Warwick Montgomery]] nominated Schaeffer for an honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] degree, which was conferred in [[1983]] by the [[Simon Greenleaf School of Law]], [[Anaheim, California]] in recognition of his apologetic writings and ministry. <ref>L. G Parkhurst. "Appendix A: Chronology of the Life of Francis Schaeffer," in ''Francis Schaeffer: The Man and His Message,'' Wheaton, IL: Tyndale House Publishers, 1985, pp. 213-215. </ref>

== Apologetics ==

Schaeffer's approach to Christian apologetics was primarily influenced by [[Herman Dooyeweerd]], [[Edward John Carnell]], and [[Cornelius Van Til]], but he was not known to be a strict presuppositionalist in the Van Tillian tradition. In a 1948 article in ''The Bible Today'', Schaeffer explained his own apologetics and how he walked a middle path between [[evidentialism]] and presuppositionalism. <ref name=Schaeffer1>Schaeffer, Francis, "A Review of a Review", in ''The Bible Today'', [[October]] [[1948]], pp. 7-9. Accessed [[2006-08-21]]. Reprinted at [http://www.pcahistory.org/documents/schaefferreview.html PCA Historical Center].</ref>   J. Budziszewski summarizes the article about this ''middle path'' approach by writing:
:Presuppositionalists, he held, are right to assert that the ultimate premises of Christian and anti<U+2013>Christian systems of thought are utterly at odds. On the other hand, evidentialists are right to assert that between Christian and anti<U+2013>Christian systems of thought there is always a point of contact. The reason for this point of contact, he argued, is that nonbelievers cannot bring themselves to be completely consistent with their own presuppositions, and this inconsistency is a result of common grace. "Thus, illogically," he wrote, "men have in their accepted [[worldview]]s various amounts of that which is ours. But, illogical though it may be, it is there and we can appeal to it." <ref>[http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft0005/correspondence.html "Evidentialists and Presuppositionalists - J. Budziszewski Replies"] by J. Budziszewski, ''Correspondence'' section of ''First Things'', [[May]] [[2000]]. Accessed [[2006-08-21]].</ref>

Schaeffer came to use this ''middle path'' as the basis for his method of evangelism which he called ''Taking the roof off.'' <ref>William Edgar, "Two Christian Warriors: Cornelius Van Til and Francis A. Schaeffer Compared," ''Westminster Theological Journal'', Vol. 57, No. 1, Spring 1995, pp. 57-80.</ref>  An example of ''Taking the roof off'' in written form can be found in Schaeffer's work entitled ''Death in the City.''  <ref name=Schaeffer2>Schaeffer, Francis, "Chapter 9: The Universe and Two Chairs," in ''Death in the City'', Reprinted at [http://sentinellenehemie.free.fr/schaeffer3_gb.html Nehemiah's Prayer Watch.] Accessed August 22, 2006. </ref> [[Nancy Pearcey]] also describes two books by Schaeffer, ''Escape From Reason'' and ''The God Who Is There'' in this way:
:In these books, Schaeffer explains the history of the two-story division of knowledge, often referred to as the fact/value split. He also describes his highly effective apologetics method, which combined elements of both evidentialism and presuppositionalism. <ref> Nancy Pearcey, 2004, ''Total Truth: Liberating Christianity From Its Cultural Captivity,'' Wheaton, IL: Crossway Books, p. 453. </ref>

==Legacy==
{{Dominionism}}
Today, more than twenty years after his death, his teachings continue in the same informal setting at The Francis A. Schaeffer Foundation in [[Gryon]], Switzerland. It is led by one of his daughters and sons-in-law as a small scale alternative to the original L'Abri Fellowship International which is still operating in nearby [[Ollon|Huemoz-sur-Ollon]] and other places in the world. [[Covenant Theological Seminary]] also has established the Francis A. Schaeffer Institute directed by a former English L'Abri member, Jerram Barrs. The purpose of the school is to train Christians to demonstrate [[compassion]]ately and defend [[reason]]ably what they see as the claims of [[Jesus|Christ]] on all of life. <ref>[http://www.covenantseminary.edu/apologetics/fsi.asp  ''Our Purpose''] FSI home page. Accessed [[2006-08-26]].</ref>

Schaeffer popularized, in the modern context, a conservative [[Puritan]] and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] perspective.

===Political Activism===
Francis Schaeffer is credited with helping spark a return to political activism among Protestant evangelicals and fundamentalists in the late [[1970s]] and early [[1980s]], especially in relation to the issue of abortion.  Schaeffer called for a challenge to what he saw as the increasing influence of secular humanism. Schaeffer's views were expressed in two works, his book entitled ''A Christian Manifesto'', as well as a film series, ''Whatever Happened to the Human Race?''.

====''A Christian Manifesto''====
Schaeffer's ''A Christian Manifesto'' <ref>Francis Schaeffer, 1982, ''A Christian Manifesto,'' (revised edition),Crossway Books. ISBN 0-89107-233-0</ref> was published in 1982.  The name of the book is intended to position its thesis as a Christian answer to ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' and the ''[[Humanist Manifesto]]'' documents of 1933 and 1973. Schaeffer's diagnosis is that the decline of Western Civilization is due to society having become increasingly [[pluralism|pluralistic]], resulting in a shift "away from a world view that was at least vaguely Christian in people's memory ... toward something completely different".  Schaeffer argues that there is a philosophical struggle between the people of God and the secular humanists.

In a sermon also titled "A Christian Manifesto", <ref>Schaeffer, Francis (1982). [http://www.peopleforlife.org/francis.html "A Christian Manifesto."] Retrieved [[2005-06-24]].</ref> Schaeffer defines [[secular humanism]] as the worldview where "man is the measure of all things," and in the book he claims that critics of the Christian Right miss the mark by confusing the "humanist religion" with humanitarianism, the humanities, or love of humans. He describes the conflict with secular humanism as a battle in which "these two religions, Christianity and humanism, stand over against each other as totalities." He writes that the decline of commitment to objective truth that he perceives in the various institutions of society is "not because of a conspiracy, but because the church has forsaken its duty to be the salt of the culture." Schaeffer explains:

:A true Christian in [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Germany]] and in the occupied countries should have defied the false and counterfeit state and hidden his [[Jewish]] neighbors from the German [[Schutzstaffel|SS Troops]]. The government had abrogated its authority, and it had no right to make any demands.

He then suggests that similar tactics be used to stop abortion.  But Schaeffer argues he is not talking about a theocracy:
:State officials must know that we are serious about stopping abortion,...''First,'' we must make definite that we are in no way talking about any kind of theocracy. Let me say that with great emphasis. Witherspoon, Jefferson, the American Founders had no idea of a theocracy. That is made plain by the First Amendment, and we must continually emphasize the fact that we are not talking about some kind, or any kind, of a theocracy. <ref>Schaeffer, Francis, ''A Christian Manifesto,'' in ''The Collected Works...'' Volume 5, pp. 485-486.</ref>

[[Christian Reconstructionism|Christian Reconstructionists]] [[Gary North]] and [[David Chilton]], were highly critical of ''A Christian Manifesto'' and Schaeffer. <ref>Gary North and David Chilton. "Apologetics and Strategy", in ''Tactics of Christian Resistance: A Symposium'', Gary North Ed. Tyler Texas: Geneva Divinity School, 1983, pp.100-140.</ref>

Their critical comments were prompted, they wrote, by the popularity of Schaeffer's book (pp.116-17). They suggested that Schaeffer supports pluralism because he sees the First Amendment as freedom of religion for all; and they themselves reject pluralism (pp.128-29). Pointing out negative statements Schaeffer made about theocracy, North and Chilton then explain why they promote it (pp.121-22). They extend their criticism of Schaeffer:  
:"The fact remains that ''Dr. Schaeffer<U+2019>s manifesto offers no prescriptions for a Christian society.'' We mention that merely in the interests of clarity, for we are not sure that anybody has noticed it up to now. The same comment applies to ''all'' of Dr. Schaeffer<U+2019>s writings: he does not spell out the Christian alternative.''(pp. 127-28; emphasis North and Chilton)''"

====Influence of Schaeffer on the Christian Right====
[[Christian Right]] leaders such as [[Tim LaHaye]] have credited Schaeffer for influencing their theological arguments urging [[politics|political]] participation by evangelicals <ref>Tim LaHaye, 1980, ''The Battle for the Mind,'' Old Tappan, NJ: Fleming H. Revell, p. 5</ref>.  [[Randall Terry]], the founder of [[Operation Rescue]], also acknowledged the influence of Schaeffer.

Beginning in the [[1990s]], critics began exploring the intellectual/ideological connection between Schaeffer<U+2019>s political activism and writings of the early [[1980s]] to contemporary religious-political trends in the Christian Right, sometimes grouped under the name [[Dominionism]], with mixed conclusions.
 
[[Sara Diamond]] <ref>Diamond, Sara (1994). "Dominion Theology: The Truth About the Christian Right's Bid for Power," ''Z Magazine'' (column) February 1995. Online: [http://www.publiceye.org/diamond/sd_domin.html here].</ref> and Frederick Clarkson <ref>Clarkson, Frederick (1994). [http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v08n1/chrisre2.html "Theocratic Dominionism Gains Influence"]. ''The Public Eye Magazine'' '''VIII''' (1 & 2).</ref> have written articles tracing the activism of numerous key figures in the Christian Right to the influence of Francis Schaeffer. According to Diamond: "The idea of taking dominion over secular society gained widespread currency with the 1981 publication of...Schaeffer's book ''A Christian Manifesto''. The book sold 290,000 copies in its first year, and it remains one of the movement's most frequently cited texts."
Diamond summarizes the book and its importance to the Christian Right:

:In ''A Christian Manifesto'', Schaeffer's argument is simple. The United States began as a nation rooted in Biblical principles. But as society became more pluralistic, with each new wave of immigrants, proponents of a new philosophy of secular humanism gradually came to dominate debate on policy issues. Since humanists place human progress, not God, at the center of their considerations, they pushed American culture in all manner of ungodly directions, the most visible results of which included legalized abortion and the secularization of the public schools. At the end of -- A Christian Manifesto, Schaeffer calls for Christians to use civil disobedience to restore Biblical morality, which explains Schaeffer's popularity with groups like Operation Rescue. Randall Terry has credited Schaeffer as a major influence in his life. 

Frederick Clarkson explains that this had practical applications:

:"Francis Schaeffer is widely credited with providing the impetus for Protestant evangelical political action against abortion. For example, Randall Terry, the founder of Operation Rescue, says: "You have to read Schaeffer's Christian Manifesto if you want to understand Operation Rescue." Schaeffer, a longtime leader in Rev. Carl McIntire's splinter denomination, the Bible Presbyterian Church, was a reader of Reconstructionist literature but has been reluctant to acknowledge its influence. Indeed, Schaeffer and his followers specifically rejected the modern application of Old Testament law."<ref>Clarkson, Frederick. (1995). <U+201C>Christian Reconstructionism: Theocratic Dominionism Gains Influence.<U+201D> In Chip Berlet (Ed.), ''Eyes Right! Challenging the Right Wing Backlash'' (pp. 59<U+2013>80). Boston: South End Press. Revised and included in Clarkson, ''Eternal Hostility''. http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v08n1/chrisre2.html</ref>

Analyses of Schaeffer as the major intellectual influence on [[Dominionism]] can be found in the works of authors such as Diamond<ref>Sara Diamond, 1995, ''Roads to Dominion: Right<U+2013>Wing Movements and Political Power in the United States'', New York: Guilford, pp. 246-249.</ref> and [[Chip Berlet]]. <ref>Chip Berlet and Matthew N. Lyons, 2000, ''Right<U+2013>Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort'', New York: Guilford Press, pp. 212-213.</ref>  Other authors argue against a close connection with dominionism, for example [[Irving Hexham]] of the [[University of Calgary]], who maintains that Schaeffer's political position has been misconstrued as advocating the Dominionist views of [[R. J. Rushdoony]], who is a [[Christian Reconstructionism|Christian Reconstructionist]]. Hexham indicates that Schaeffer's essential philosophy was derived from [[Herman Dooyeweerd]], not Rushdoony, and that [[Hans Rookmaaker]] introduced Schaeffer to his writings. <ref name=Hexham>Hexham, Irving, "The Evangelical Response to the New Age," in Perspectives on the New Age, edited by James R. Lewis & J. Gordon Melton, State University of New York Press, Albany, New York, 1992, pp. 152-163, and especially p. 322 Note 16. </ref> Dooyeweerd was a Dutch legal scholar and philosopher, following in the footsteps of [[Neo-Calvinism|Neo-Calvinist]] [[Abraham Kuyper]].

==Frank Schaeffer==

Francis Schaeffer's son, [[Frank Schaeffer]], became a Hollywood film director and successful author, writing internationally acclaimed novels depicting life in a strict, fundamentalist household including ''Portofino,'' ''Zermatt,'' and ''Saving Grandma.'' Critics say these books denounce his upbringing, along with his father.  He is most recently the author of ''Baby Jack,'' a novel about a Marine killed in Iraq.  He is also known for his best selling non-fiction books related to the United States Marine Corps, including ''Keeping Faith--A Father-Son Story About Love and the United States Marine Corps,'' co-written with his son John Schaeffer, and ''AWOL--The Unexcused Absence Of America's Upper Classes From Military Service and How It Hurts Our Country,'' co-authored with former Clinton presidential aide, Kathy Roth-Douquet. Frank Schaeffer has distanced himself from many of his father's views and has converted to the [[Greek Orthodox]] church in 1990 which he says "embraces paradox and [[Eastern Orthodox Church#The Mysteries|mystery]]." <ref>[http://www.beliefnet.com/story/135/story_13586_1.html "Fundamentalists to the Right, Fundamentalists to the Left"] by Frank Schaeffer, from Beliefnet.com. Accessed [[2006-08-26]].</ref>

==Writings==
Francis A. Schaeffer wrote twenty-two books, which cover a range of spiritual issues. They can be roughly split into five sections, as in the edition of his ''Complete Works'' (ISBN 0-89107-347-7):
*'''A Christian View of Philosophy and Culture''': The first three books in this block are known as Schaeffer's "trilogy," laying down the apologetical, philosophical, epistemological, and theological foundation for all his work.
**''[[The God Who Is There]]'': Deals with the existence and relevance of God, and how modern man came to first distance himself from, and ultimately disbelieve, God as revealed by the Bible.
**''[[Escape from Reason]]'': How the rejection of the Biblical God causes man to lose contact with reality and reason.
**''[[He Is There and He Is Not Silent]]'': How God speaks to man through the Bible on the three philosophically fundamental areas of [[metaphysics]], [[morals]], and [[epistemology]].
**''[[Back to Freedom and Dignity]]'': An answer to [[B.F. Skinner]]'s ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]]'', arguing that freedom and dignity of man are God-given and therefore can't be left aside without dire consequences.
*'''A Christian View of the Bible as Truth'''
**''Genesis in Space and Time'': Argues that an almost literalist view of Genesis as historically true is fundamental to the Christian faith.
**''No Final Conflict''
**''Joshua and the Flow of Biblical History''
**''Basic Bible Studies'': Biblical studies on the fundamentals of the faith.
**''Art and the Bible ''
*'''A Christian View of Spirituality'''
**''No Little People'': Argues that Christians should never despair of having a significant life of realisations, small as they seem to be.
**''[[True Spirituality]]'': The spiritual foundation for Schaeffer's work, as a complement to the theological and philosophical approach of most other books. Useful for gaining a balanced view of the whole of Schaeffer's life and ministry.
**''The New Super-Spirituality'': Claims the intellectual decadence of students and the counter-culture from the late sixties to the early seventies can be traced back to the conformism of their fathers, only with fewer moral absolutes, and predicts the contamination of the church. Offers an analysis of [[Postmodernism]].
**''Two Contents, Two Realities'': First presented as a position paper at the [[First International Congress on World Evangelization]] at [[Lausanne|Lausanne, Switzerland]] in 1974.
*'''A Christian View of the Church'''
**''The Church at the End of the Twentieth Century''
**''The Church before the Watching World''
**[[Mark of the Christian|''The Mark of the Christian'']]: Analyses the balance between the holiness of God and the love of God in the spiritual life of the [[Bible-believing|Bible-believing Christian.]]
**''[[Death in the City]]''
**''The Great Evangelical Disaster ''
*'''A Christian View of the West'''
**''[[Pollution and the Death of Man]].'' A Christian response to issues concerning [[ecology]].
**''[[How Should We Then Live?|How Should We Then Live? The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture]].'' This is also a film/video series produced and directed by his son Frank Schaeffer.
**''Whatever Happened to the Human Race? '' (with former [[C. Everett Koop|Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop]]). A Christian response to abortion, [[euthanasia]], and [[infanticide]]. This is also a film/video series produced and directed by his son Frank Schaeffer.
**''A Christian Manifesto'': Christian principles for secular politics.

In addition to his books, one of the last public lectures Schaeffer delivered was at the Law Faculty, University of Strasbourg. It was published as "Christian Faith and Human Rights", ''The Simon Greenleaf Law Review'', 2 (1982-83) pp. 3-12.  Most of his writings during his Bible Presbyterian days have not been collected, nor reprinted in decades.

In addition to the five volume ''Complete Works'' listed above there were also two books by Dr. Schaeffer published after his death:
* Dennis, Lane T. (ed) ''Letters of Francis A. Schaeffer'', Crossway Books, Westchester, 1985.
* Schaeffer, Francis A. ''The Finished Work of Christ: The Truth of Romans 1-8'', Crossway Books, Wheaton, 1998.
