Boyle attended [[St. Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Francis de Sales school]] and [[West Philadelphia Catholic High School For Boys]]. After high school Boyle spent three years as a novice of the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools]], or De La Salle Brothers, a Catholic teaching order. He lived in a house of studies with other novices and earned a BA from [[La Salle University]] in Philadelphia in 1957, but left the order because he did not feel called to religious life.<ref>{{cite news

===Screen and theater===
Boyle gained acclaim for his first starring role, playing the title character, a bigoted [[New York City]] factory worker, in the [[1970 in film|1970]] movie ''[[Joe (film)|Joe]]''. The film's release was surrounded by controversy over its violence and language. It was during this time that Boyle became close friends with actress [[Jane Fonda]], and with her he participated in many [[opposition to the Vietnam War|protests]] against the [[Vietnam War]]. After seeing people cheer at his role in ''Joe'', Boyle refused the lead role in ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971),<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001967/bio Peter Boyle Biography] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> as well as other movie and TV roles that he believed glamorized violence. His next major role was as the [[campaign manager]] for a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] candidate ([[Robert Redford]]) in ''[[The Candidate (1972 film)|The Candidate]]'' (1972).  He also played an [[Irish Mob|Irish mobster]] opposite [[Robert Mitchum]] in ''[[The Friends of Eddie Coyle]]'' (1973).  

Boyle had another hit role as [[Frankenstein's monster]] in the [[1974 in film|1974]] [[Mel Brooks]] comedy ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', in which, in an homage to ''[[King Kong]]'', the monster is placed onstage in top hat and tails, grunt-singing and dancing to the song "[[Puttin' on the Ritz]]". Boyle said at the time, "The Frankenstein monster I play is a baby. He's big and ugly and scary, but he's just been born, remember, and it's been traumatic, and to him the whole world is a brand new alien environment. That's how I'm playing it".<ref name="wapost"/> Boyle met his wife, Loraien Alterman, on the set of ''Young Frankenstein'' while she was there as a reporter for ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. He was still in his Frankenstein makeup when he asked her for a date.<ref name="yahooap">{{cite news

Boyle received his first Emmy nomination for his acclaimed dramatic performance in the 1977 television film ''[[Tail Gunner Joe]]'', in which he played Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]. Yet he was more often cast as a character actor than as a leading man. [[Image:Peterboylebuffaloroam.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Boyle portrays [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]] alongside [[Bill Murray]] in the 1980 film ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]''.]] His roles include the philosophical cab driver "Wizard" in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), starring [[Robert De Niro]]; the attorney of [[gonzo journalist]] [[Hunter S.

In cameo roles, he can be seen as a tough police officer in ''[[Malcolm X (film)|Malcolm X]]'' (1992), and as a [[drawbridge]] operator in ''[[Porky's Revenge]]'' (1985). In 1992, he starred in [[Alex Cox]]'s ''[[Death and the Compass (film)|Death and the Compass]]'', an adaptation of [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' ''[[Death and the Compass|La Muerte y la Brujula]]''. However, the film was not released until 1996. 

His New York [[theater]] work included playing a comedian who is the object of ''[[The Roast]]'', a 1980 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play directed by Carl Reiner. Also in 1980 he co-starred with [[Tommy Lee Jones]] in an [[Off-Broadway]] production of playwright [[Sam Shepard]]'s acclaimed ''[[True West (play)|True West]]''. Two years later, Boyle played the head of a dysfunctional family in [[Joe Pintauro]]'s less well-received ''[[Snow Orchid]]'', at the [[Circle Repertory]].

In 1986, Boyle played the title role of the acclaimed but short-lived TV series ''[[Joe Bash]]'', created by [[Danny Arnold]]. The [[comedy-drama]] followed the life of a lonely, world-weary, and sometimes compromised New York City [[police officer|beat cop]] whose closest friend was a prostitute, played by actress [[DeLane Matthews]].<ref>{{cite web

===Later life and career===
In 1990, Boyle suffered a near-fatal [[stroke]] that rendered him completely speechless and immobile for six months. After recovering, he went on to win an [[Emmy Award]] in 1996 as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his appearance on ''[[The X-Files]]''. In the episode, "[[Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose]]", he played an [[insurance]] salesman who can see selected things in the near future, particularly others' deaths. Boyle also guest starred in two episodes as Bill Church in ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''. He appears in [[Sony Music]]'s unaired [[Roger Waters]]' music video "Three Wishes" (1992) as a scruffy [[genie]] in a dirty coat and red scarf, who tries to tempt Waters at a desert [[diner]].<ref>Videos, both aired and unaired, are routinely distributed to the music press; this clip appears on fan-made [[Bootleg recording|bootleg video]] compilations: {{cite news

Boyle was perhaps most widely known for his role as the deadpan, cranky [[Frank Barone]] in the [[CBS]] television [[sitcom]] ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'', which aired from 1996 to 2005. The show was shot in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], to which Boyle commuted from his New York City home. He was nominated for an Emmy seven times for this role, but never won (beaten out multiple times in the Supporting Actor category by his co-star [[Brad Garrett]]), though fellow co-stars Garrett, [[Ray Romano]], [[Patricia Heaton]], and Boyle's TV wife [[Doris Roberts]] won at least one Emmy each for their performances.

In 1999, he had a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on the set of ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]].'' He soon regained his health and returned to the series. In 2001, he appeared in the film ''[[Monster's Ball]]'' as the bigoted father of [[Billy Bob Thornton]]'s character.

Introduced by comedian [[Carlos Mencia]] as "the most honest man in show business", Boyle made guest appearances on three episodes of the [[Comedy Central]] program ''[[Mind of Mencia]]'' &mdash; one of which was shown as a tribute in a segment made before Boyle's death &mdash; in which he read hate mail, explained the "hidden meanings" behind bumper stickers, and occasionally told Mencia how he felt about him.

Starting in late 2005, Boyle and former TV wife Roberts appeared in [[TV commercials]] for the 75th anniversary of [[Alka-Seltzer]], reprising the famous line, "I can't believe I ate that whole thing!" Although this quote has entered into popular culture, it is often misquoted as, "''...the'' whole thing."<ref>{{cite web

===Death and legacy===
On [[December 12]], [[2006]], Boyle died in New York City at [[New York Presbyterian Hospital]] after suffering from [[multiple myeloma]] and [[heart disease]]. At the time of his death, Boyle had completed the film ''[[All Roads Lead Home]]''{{Fact|date=February 2008}} and was scheduled to appear in ''[[Chatham (2008 film)|Chatham]]''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0882969/] See Trivia </ref> The end credits of ''[[The Santa Clause 3]]'' include a dedication to his memory.

On [[October 18]], [[2007]], which would have been Boyle's 72nd birthday, his friend [[Bruce Springsteen]], during a [[Madison Square Garden]] concert with the [[E Street Band]] in New York, dedicated "[[Meeting Across the River]]", segueing into "[[Jungleland]]", in memory of Boyle, stating:  "An old friend passed away a while back <U+2014> we met him when we first came to New York City... Today would have been his birthday."
