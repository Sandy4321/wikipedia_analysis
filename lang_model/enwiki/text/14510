==Athletic director==
Crow became the [[athletic director]] and head football coach at [[Northeast Louisiana University]] in 1975.<ref name=heisman/>  He remained there until 1981, when he left to pursue private business opportunities.<ref name=custred2/>

In 1983, he became assistant athletic director at Texas A&M under [[Jackie Sherrill]], who served as both athletic director and head coach of the football team.  Crow handled most duties for all sports except football, which Sherrill oversaw.<ref name=custred2>{{citation|last=Custred|first=Jayne|title=Sherrill aftermath/Crow: Mixed feelings on Sherrill departure|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|location=[[Houston, Texas]]|date=[[December 14]], [[1988]]|page=Sports, page 6|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1988_590290|accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref>  He was promoted to [[athletic director]] at the end of the 1988 football season when Sherrill, resigned in the midst of a scandal.  Texas A&M President William Mobley hired [[R. C. Slocum]], Sherrill's [[defensive coordinator]], as the new head football coach.<ref name=custred>{{citation|last=Custred|first=Jayne|last2=Farmer|first2=Neal|title=Aggie coach Sherrill quits amid scandal|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|location=[[Houston, Texas]]|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1988_589933|date=[[December 13]], [[1988]]|page=Section A, page 1|accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref>  In a press conference the day after his appointment, Crow announced that "'I want to reaffirm my commitment to full compliance with the NCAA, Southwest Conference and Texas A&M University regulations in our athletic department.'"<ref name=integrity>{{citation|title=2 vow to revive A&M integrity|newspape[[Houston Chronicle]]|location=[[Houston, Texas]]|date=[[December 14]], [[1988]]|page=Section A, page 1|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1988_590201|accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref>

After a public row in January 1990, Crow fired long-time [[Texas A&M Aggies basketball|Aggies basketball]] coach [[Shelby Metcalf]].  Metcalf had coached at Texas A&M for 32&nbsp;years, winning five [[Southwest Conference]] championships.  The relationship between the men had often been described as bitter, and Crow cited "uncalled-for criticism" in his firing of Metcalf, who was not given the opportunity to say goodbye to his players.  Crow appointed [[Kermit Davis]] to replace Metcalf.<ref name=lopez>{{citation|last=Lopez|first=John P.|title=Ex-A&M coac Metcalf adjusts to new job, life|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|location=[[Houston, Texas]]|date=[[March 2]], [[1991]]|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1991_766983|accessdate=2007-09-26|page=Sports, page 6}}</ref>

Later that year, after [[University of Arkansas|Arkansas]] left the Southwest Conference, Crow and [[DeLoss Dodds]], the athletic director at the University of Texas, met with officials from the [[Pac-10 Conference]] about aligning with that conference.  The two later cancelled a similar meeting with officials from the [[Southeastern Conference]].<ref name=expansion>{{citation|title=UT, Texas A&M officials cancel meeting on SEC expansion plan|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|location=[[Houston, Texas]]|date=[[August 19]], [[1990]]|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1990_723861|accessdate=2007-09-26|page=Sports, page 4}}</ref>

Crow resigned from his position as athletic director in April 1993 to invest as a limited partner in a greyhound racetrack.  At the time of his resignation, the Texas A&M football program was embroiled in a scandal over students accepting money from boosters for jobs they had not performed.  He was succeeded as athletic director by Wally Groff.  As a result of the scandal, the Texas A&M football program was placed on five&nbsp;years probation and was banned from television or postseason appearances for one&nbsp;year.<ref name=stickney>{{citation|last=Stickney|first=W.H., Jr.|title=Chronology of events in Texas A&M probation|date=[[January 6]], [[1994]]|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|location=[[Houston, Texas]]|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1994_1176040|accessdate=2007-09-26|page=Sports, page 2.}}</ref>
He then took a job as the fundraiser for the university until 2001, when he retired.<ref name=zwenerman2/>
