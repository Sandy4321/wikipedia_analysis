==Early life==
When Breslow was 12 years old, his sister Lesley -- two years older -- was diagnosed with pediatric [[thyroid cancer]].[http://www.twincities.com/ci_11691923?source=most_viewed]  This experience led Breslow to take an interest in molecular biophysics and biochemistry.  Later in life, Breslow formed a [[non-profit foundation]] to help children with cancer.  His sister in 2008 was a 15-year cancer survivor.[http://www.wane.com/Global/story.asp?S=8071047&nav=menu32_4]

"There's a lot of variables, but I put in some figures and came up with answers for a fastball, curve, or slider. It's rather simple once you do it."[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/26/sports/BBA-Indians-Breslow.php]

"He's strong," Cleveland manager [[Eric Wedge]] said. "I want to be able to use him two innings. He's done that--if you look at his innings pitched the last couple of years versus appearances."[http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-basebl/stories/040208abb.html]
