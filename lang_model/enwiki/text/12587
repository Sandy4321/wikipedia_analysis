'''Jiang Biwei ''' or '''Tangzhen Jiang ''' (1899 <U+2013> 1978) was influential in the lives of the painter [[Xu Beihong]] and the politician [[Chang Tao-fan]]. She published her memoirs and she is portrayed in Chinese historical dramas.

==Life==
Jiang was born in [[Yixing]] in 1899. Both of her parents were poets and writers. She was married to Zha Zhihan who came from an influential family when she was fourteen. In 1916 her family moved to avoid conflict in Yixing and so that her father could be a professor at [[Fudan University]] in [[Shanghai]]. One of the student friends of her father was the ambitious and talented artist [[Xu Beihong]]. He would come to visit her family and he and Jiang became close. Xu was set to go to Japan to study and Jiang was upset that she would shortly have to leave to rejoin her husband. Divorce was impossible so they eloped to Japan and left a note behind. The embarrassment for the family was so important that they told Jiang's husband that she had died suddenly from an illness. Their anger subsided after Jiang wrote a letter of apology from Japan. After six months the couple moved to Shanghai where Xu was offered a bursary to study in France. In 1918 they both left and while Xu studied art in France she learnt French so that she could run the household.<ref name=lee/> Xu's bursary was not always regular and although he enrolled at top art schools they had to briefly move to Berlin where their francs would stretch further. At another point Jiang had to embrouider at five francs a piece to make ends meet.<ref name=sullivan>{{cite book|last1=Sullivan|first1=Michael|title=Art and artists of twentieth century China|date=1996|publisher=Univ. of California Press|location=Berkeley [u.a.]|isbn=0520075560|page=69}}</ref>

In 1925 Xu returned to China alone to gather more funds leaving Jiang in Paris. However Jiang was pregnant and she returned to China where she had a son Xu Boyang in 1927 and a daughter, Xu Lili, two years later.<ref name=lee/>

Xu rose to be a Professor of Art at the University in Nanjing. In 1930 Xu revealed that he had fallen in love with [[Sun Duoci]], one of his part-time students. Jiang agreed to ignore this unfortunate turn of events. In 1933 Professor Xu was asked to go on a European tour with his exhibition and Jiang asked to go with him. This was an opportunity for them to be free of Sun Duoci who was left at the university where she was now enrolled as a full-time student. Xu was still in love with her and he saw her as a genius of painting and he had frequently used her as a model for his own work.<ref name=lee/> After they returned from their tour of Europe via Russia her husband and Sun Duoci would go on sketching trips with other students. The gossip was too much for Jiang to bear and in her anger she destroyed artworks at their house which featured Sun Duoci. Xu agreed to not end their relationship and Sun Duoci left the university - without a degree.<ref name=ccc>[http://history.cultural-china.com/en/48History15069.html Sun Duoci], Cultural China.com, retrieved 2 April 2015</ref>

They agreed to separate in 1935. and  and several days later he announced his engagement to another woman entirely.

The following year Jiang renewed her friendship with [[Chang Tao-fan]] who she had known in Paris in the 1920s. Jiang had married but he had always admired Jiang and now the two of them exchanged love letters. It was said that the Japanese were to bomb the city so Chang Tao-fan arranged for her to leave the city and join him in [[Chongqing]]. Here they were able to meet and correspond more freely but Jiang could never appear at official functions with him as he still had a French wife. Chang was a vice-minister of education and Jiang was able to re-use her time in Paris by teaching French at the local university.<ref name=lee>{{cite book|last1=editors-in-chief|last2=Lee|first2=Lily Xiao Hong|last3=Wiles|first3=A.D.

In 1938 Xu published in the local newspaper that Jiang and his relationship had now ended.

In 1944 Xu again published in the local newspaper that Jiang and his relationship had ended and followed it some days letter with an engagement announcement. Jiang saw that this was time to formally end her marriage and she requested a substantial settlement. Xu agreed to her terms but devaluation of the currency meant that the terms were not as attractive as Jiang had planned.<ref name=lee/>

Chang's French wife was a difficulty in Chinese society and Chang sent her abroad for some years. Chinese students who had brought back foreign wives were considered foolish.<ref name=chou>{{cite book|last1=Chou|first1=Susan Chan Egan, Chih-p<U+02B9>ing|title=A Pragmatist and his free spirit : the half-century romance of Hu Shi & Edith Clifford Williams|date=2009|publisher=Chinese University Press|location=Hong Kong|isbn=9629963418|page=444}}</ref>
