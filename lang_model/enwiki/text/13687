"'''D<U+00F8>d Kalm'''" is the nineteenth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 2)|second season]] of the [[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[The X-Files]]''. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on March 10, 1995. The story was written by [[Howard Gordon]], the teleplay was written by Gordon and [[Alex Gansa]], and the episode was directed by [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]]. The episode is a [[List of Monster-of-the-Week characters in The X-Files|"Monster-of-the-Week"]] story, unconnected to the series' wider [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. "D<U+00F8>d Kalm" earned a Nielsen household rating of 10.7, being watched by 10.2 million households in its initial broadcast. The episode received mostly mixed-to-positive reviews.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. In the episode, Mulder and Scully are called in when a boatload of survivors from a U.S. Navy destroyer are found. What particularly catches Agent Mulder's attention is that all of these Sailors appear to have aged many decades in the course of a few days. Mulder and Scully travel to [[Norway]] where they find a civilian fisherman who is willing to take them to the destroyer's last known position.

"D<U+00F8>d Kalm" was written to make use of the show's access to a navy destroyer that had been used in the previous episodes "[[Colony (The X-Files)|Colony]]" and "[[End Game (The X-Files)|End Game]]." The episode was originally intended as a way to give the production crew a rest after several "demanding" episodes had been shot, but the episode became one of the most difficult to film of the second season.

==Plot==
In the [[Norwegian Sea]], chaos erupts on board the USS ''Ardent'', an American [[destroyer escort]]. Due mysterious-yet-unspecified events, half of the ''Ardent'''s crew board lifeboats and abandon ship. Eighteen hours later, they are spotted by a [[Canada|Canadian]] fishing vessel; however, in that short span of time, the young crew members have undergone rapid aging.

When the ''Ardent'' is reported missing, [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) is summoned to the [[National Naval Medical Center|Bethesda Naval Hospital]] by [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]). Scully visits the ship's sole surviving crew member, Lt. Harper, who has been quarantined in the hospital's ICU. She finds that Harper, despite being in his twenties, has aged to the point of being unrecognizable. Mulder tells Scully that the ''Ardent'' vanished at the [[65th parallel north|65th parallel]], a location of with a history of ship disappearances. Mulder believes that a "wrinkle in time" exists there, and that the ''Ardent'' was the subject of government experimentation related to the [[Philadelphia Experiment]] of [[World War II]].

Upon arriving in [[Norway]], Mulder and Scully try to find sailors willing to take them near the ''Ardent'''s last known location. Only an American [[naval trawler]] captain, Henry Trondheim ([[John Savage]]), agrees to help. At sea, Trondheim's boat encounters heavy fog and crashes into the bow of the ''Ardent''. Mulder, Scully, Trondheim, and his [[first mate]], Halverson, board the apparent ghost ship and find signs of advanced [[corrosion]], even though the ''Ardent'' is only a few years old. Below decks, the [[mummified]] remains of other crew members are discovered. Suddenly, Trondheim's boat is stolen, stranding the party aboard the ship. 

The agents find that the ship's engines and communications systems are corroded beyond repair. Mulder theorizes that the purported experimentation has led to time "speeding up", causing both the ''Ardent'' and the corpses to decay rapidly. The party hears a commotion below decks, where Halverson is found dead and the ''Ardent'''s commanding officer, Captain Barclay, is discovered alive. The agents question the wizened Barclay, who claims that his crew had seen a "glowing light" in the ocean and that "time got lost". Mulder and Scully agree that the frail Barclay couldn't have murdered Halverson, and that someone else is aboard the ship.

While casting Halverson's body out to sea, Trondheim is attacked by a Norweigian pirate whaler named Olafsson; it is revealed that Olafsson killed Halverson and that his crew commandeered Trondheim's boat. Mulder and Trondheim subdue Olafsson, who hasn't aged despite being on the ship for the past two days. After Barclay dies, a [[crystalline]] material begins to form on his body. Mulder, Scully, and Trondheim eventually begin to show signs of unnatural aging just as the ''Ardent'''s crew had. Scully develops a theory that the ''Ardent'' is sailing near a metallic object beneath the ocean, and that it has caused [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] to rapidly [[oxidize]] their bodies and environment, leading to the hastened aging effect.

Mulder notices that only one ceiling pipe has not corroded through. Both he and Scully follow the pipe to the ship's sewage hold, where Olafsson and his crew were previously holed up. The agents realize that something from the ocean contaminated the ''Ardent'''s potable water and led to the metamorphosis of the ship and her crew, while Olafsson's men remained unaffected due to their consumption of recycled water from the sewage system. They further realize that there isn't much drinkable water left to keep them alive. Meanwhile, Trondheim learns about the water from Olafsson. Desperate to survive, Trondheim kills Olafsson and sets out to keep the water for himself.

Scully learns from blood tests that the contaminated water causes rapid cellular damage and dramatically increases [[sodium chloride]] in the body. Trondheim attempts to convince Scully to do away with Mulder, since he is the weakest, but she dismisses him. She tries to [[ration]] the water amongst the three, but eventually discovers Trondheim attempting to [[hoard]] what little drinkable water that remains. The crazed Trondheim locks Scully out of the sewage hold, forcing her to use minuscule supplies from a [[snow globe]] and a [[sardine]] can to keep Mulder alive. The ''Ardent'''s ongoing corrosion eventually eats through the ship's hull, flooding the sewage hold and drowning Trondheim. The agents both lose consciousness shortly before Navy rescuers arrive on the ''Ardent'' to save them. 

Scully comes to at the Bethesda Naval Hospital, where both she and Mulder are being treated. She is told that her written observations on the case have helped naval doctors reverse their aging and save Mulder from near-certain death. Scully tries to speak to a naval liaison about salvaging the ''Ardent'', but is told that the ship has sunk. The episode ends with a camera shot of fog on the water, leaving the viewer clueless to what the real anomaly is.<ref name="l207"/>

===Writing===
Series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] asked [[Howard Gordon]] to write "D<U+00F8>d Kalm" because the ''X-Files'' had been given access to a [[Canada|Canadian]] navy destroyer for the previous episodes "[[Colony (The X-Files)|Colony]]" and "[[End Game (The X-Files)|End Game]]."<ref name="l209"/> The episode was originally intended as a way to give the production crew a rest after several "demanding" episodes had been shot.<ref name="l208">Lowry, p. 208</ref> Before the script had been finished, Carter mentioned that he believed the episode would be a "great rest for everyone."<ref name="l209">Lowry, p. 209</ref>

In the book ''The Unofficial X-Files Companion'', N.E. Genge notes that aspects of the episode bear striking resemblances to the [[Philadelphia Experiment]], the alleged naval military experiment.<ref name="g194">Genge, p. 194</ref> Indeed, the episode contains several mentions and allusions to the experiment.<ref name="dodkalm">{{Cite episode | title = D<U+00F8>d Kalm | accessdate = 20 January 2011 | series = The X-Files | serieslink = The X-Files | network = Fox | airdate = 10 March 1995 | season = 2 | number = 19}}</ref>

===Filming===
[[Her Majesty's Canadian Ship|HMCS]] ''[[HMCS Mackenzie (DDE 261)|Mackenzie]]'', a decommissioned [[Canadian Forces]] destroyer, was used for interior and exterior shots as the USS ''Ardent''.<ref name="g73"/> The ship had previously been used to shoot interior scenes for the climax of the episode "[[End Game (The X-Files)|End Game]]".<ref name="prod2.5">Lovece, p. 157</ref> The ship was repainted in order to more closely resemble an abandoned ship, a technique Graeme Murray referred to as "paint-aged."<ref name="g73"/> Originally docked at [[New Westminster#Westminster Quay|New Westminster Quay]], the ship was relocated to the more remote location of Barry Point to avoid night lights when filming exterior shots of the ship.<ref name="g73">Gradnitzer p. 73</ref> The move cost the show approximately 10,000 dollars.<ref name="g73"/> The ''Mackenzie'', once the [[lead ship]] of [[Mackenzie class destroyer|its class]], was stripped and [[scuttled]] shortly after filming ended and now serves as an [[artificial reef]] off the [[Georgia Strait]].<ref name="g73"/>

In order to ease filming, the producers sought out a set that could portray both a bar and a hospital, a task initally dubbed "impossible." However, Jericho Sailing Club in Vancouver later stood in for both the Norwegian bar and the hospital to which Mulder and Scully are taken.<ref name="g74">Gradnitzer p. 74</ref> The cast and crew of "D<U+00F8>d Kalm" reportedly found the dual-set "amazing."<ref name="g74"/> The location of the set was only a short distance away from where David Duchovny was living.<ref name="g74"/> The producers subsequently decided to try and find possible locations closer to where the main stars were living in order to ease future filming.<ref name="g74"/>

"D<U+00F8>d Kalm" received mostly mixed to moderately positive reviews.

The two noted that, while the episode's premise "brims over with atmosphere", the ending of "D<U+00F8>d Kalm" was extremely lacking. Shearman and Pearson argued "that if the writers can only devise a plot which paints them into a corner so awkward there's no realistic way they can get out, then they shouldn't write the story at all."<ref name="shearman"/> The two also criticized the episode's make up. They noted that "Scully looks like a credible old lady, Mulder rather more like a man wearing several layers of latex."<ref name="shearman">Shearman and Pearson, p. 48-49</ref>
