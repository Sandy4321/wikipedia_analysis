The '''Battle of the Sittang Bend''' or also known as the '''Japanese Breakout across Pegu Yomas''' was a [[Japanese]] military operation as part of the [[Burma Campaign]] fought at the end of [[World War II]]. Surviving elements of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] attempted a mass breakout of their perimeter in the Pegu Yoma to head Eastwards and join other Japanese troops retreating from [[British Empire]] forces. The breakout was the objective of the Japanese [[Twenty-Eighth Army (Japan)|28th Army]] with support at first with the [[Thirty-Third Army (Japan)|33rd Army]] and later the [[Fifteenth Army (Japan)|15th Army]]. With the British alert the breakout attempt ended in almost complete catastrophe with heavy losses and some formations being wiped out. In the end around 14,000 Japanese were lost, with well over half being killed while British led allies suffered only 95 killed and 322 wounded.<ref name=autogenerated3/> The breakout attempt and the ensuing battle became the location of the last significant pitched land battle of the Western powers in the Second World War.<ref>Tucker pg. 60</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite book|last=Saunders|first=Hilary St. George.|title=ROYAL AIR FORCE 1939-1945 VOL 3|date=1954|publisher=HMSO|page=362-63|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MkVNMwEACAAJ&dq=ROYAL+AIR+FORCE+1939-1945+VOL+3.+Hilary+St.+George.+Saunder+(Author)&hl=en&sa=X&ei=K2kvU42xCMeQhQf1z4HIDg&ved=0CEMQ6AEwAA}}</ref>

==Background==
By early 1944, the British led allied forces in [[India]] had been reinforced and had expanded their logistic infrastructure, which made it possible for them to contemplate an attack into Burma. The Japanese attempted to forestall them by an invasion of India, which led to a heavy Japanese defeat at the [[Operation U-Go]], and other setbacks in Northern Burma.<ref>Slim, p.368</ref> Following a further defeat at the hands of [[William Slim]] and the [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] at [[Battle of Meiktila and Mandalay|Meiktila and Mandalay]] and the [[Operation Dracula|recapture of Rangoon]], Japanese losses were further handicapped by their defence of Burma.<ref>Allen, pp.479-480</ref>

By now the [[Burmese National Army]] under [[Aung San]] had switched sides (becoming the Burma Patriotic Army) and was hunting down Japanese patrols and foraging parties.<ref name=autogenerated0>Farquharson pg. 298-300</ref>

After the fall of Rangoon Fourteenth Army HQ under Slim now moved to [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] to plan operations to recapture [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Singapore]]. A new [[British Twelfth Army|Twelfth Army]] headquarters under General [[Montagu Stopford]] was formed from [[XXXIII Corps (British India)|XXXIII Corps]] HQ and took over  [[IV Corps (United Kingdom)|IV Corps]].<ref>Allen, pp.480</ref>

On 6 May, the leading troops of [[17th Infantry Division (India)|17th Division]], pushed their way through flooded [[paddy field]]s southwards from [[Pegu]], at [[Hlegu]] {{convert|28|mi|km}} north east of Rangoon. The Japanese [[Twenty-Eighth Army (Japan)|Twenty-Eighth Army]] under Lieutenant General [[Sh<U+014D>z<U+014D> Sakurai]], after retreating from [[Arakan]] and the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy valley]], had reached the [[Pegu Yomas]] which is a range of low mountains, hills and uplands between the Irrawaddy and the [[Sittaung River]] in central Burma.<ref name="Seekins-357">Seekins, Donald M. (2006) ''Historical dictionary of Burma (Myanmar)'' Scarecrow Press, Lanham, Maryland, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zY5F88wiDYYC&pg=PA357 page 357], ISBN 0-8108-5476-7</ref> The Sittang was unfordable and was therefore a significant military barrier, as it had been in 1942 during the first [[Battle of Sittang Bridge |Burma campaign]].<ref>Slim 1956, p. 18.</ref>

The Japanese trapped in this area due to the element of the terrain prepared a massive breakout operation; the 28th army planned to break out and rejoin [[Japanese Burma Area Army|Burma Area Army]] and escape into Thailand with them. General [[Heitar<U+014D> Kimura]] ordered [[Thirty-Third Army (Japan)|Thirty-Third Army]] to cover this break-out by a diversionary offensive across the Sittang, although the entire army could muster the strength of barely a brigade. In support the Japanese [[Fifteenth Army (Japan)|15th Army]] were to coordinate their efforts with the 28th Army if the operation was failing to meet it's objective.<ref name=autogenerated0/> British intelligence were aware of the breakout but had no detailed plans, so Stopford ordered General [[Frank Messervy]]'s British IV Corps to spread itself over more than a hundred miles of front in order to block their way. Major General Hideji Matsui<U+2019>s 105th Independent Mixed Brigade also known as <U+2018>Kani<U+2019> Force, (men of anti-aircraft batteries, airfield construction battalions, naval anchorage units, NCO schools) joined the remnants of the [[Twenty-Eighth Army (Japan)|Japanese Twenty-Eighth Army]] in the Pegu Yomas.<ref name=autogenerated/>

==Operation==
On 2 July 1945 a [[Gurkha]] patrol ambushed and wiped out a small Japanese force and captured a dispatch bag containing, the complete operational plan for the Japanese breakout.<ref name=autogenerated0/> The Japanese planned to advance to the Sittang in three columns, under strict rules of engagement forbidding use of firearms in favor of the bayonet and forbidding any radio communications once they had crossed the Sittang by using raft mostly made of bamboo.<ref name=autogenerated3/> Sakurai underestimated the British strength arrayed against him but believed he could get over half his force across in fighting shape.<ref name=autogenerated1/> One of the routes of march lay directly across 17 Indian Division's headquarters at [[Penwegon]] and Messervy reinforced this critical sector with [[64th Indian Infantry Brigade|64th Indian Brigade]] from elements of the [[19th Infantry Division (India)|19th Indian Division]]. The intelligence was quickly distributed among the British forces, which had two weeks to prepare to destroy the breakout.<ref name=autogenerated2/>

===1st Battle===
The Japanese 33rd Army attacked the Sittang Bend on 3 July 1945 attempting to assist the breakout, but it was mistimed, taking place too soon before the 28th Army made its advance to the river which was not for another week at least.<ref name=autogenerated1/> The Japanese were allowed to advance forward unaware that their plans were known to the British, until many of their troops were in the targeted exposed positions and then the barrage of shell fire and bombing started.<ref name=autogenerated3/> Artillery pounded the Japanese attack; [[Royal Artillery]] [[Artillery observer|foo]]'s (forward observation officers) continually monitored Japanese movements and gave the signal to fire.<ref name=autogenerated/> 

[[Royal Air Force]] '[[Close air support|cab rank]]' patrols under the direction of visual control posts called upon Squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] and [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|Thunderbolts]] on known Japanese targets. The destruction on 4th July of three 105 mm guns by the Thunderbolts of [[No. 42 Squadron RAF|No. 42 Squadron]] was an example of air power success.<ref name=autogenerated2/>

By 7th July Kimura ordered 33rd Army to halt any further operations having suffered casaulties and pulled back hoping it would be enough for 28th army to breakout but the British knew of this anyway and switched their attention to that sector.<ref name=autogenerated/>

===Battle of the Breakout===
[[File:The War in the Far East- the Burma Campaign 1941-1945 CF660.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Supermarine Spitfire]] Mark VIII of No 607 Squadron is prepped by RAF crew during monsoon conditions at [[Mingaladon]], prepare for a sortie against the Japanese breakout attempt at Sittang]]
On the 15th July the 28th Army, despite the mistiming of the 33rd army attack, attempted their breakout, but also unaware that the British knew of their plans.<ref name=autogenerated3/> The monsoon had begun in force, and the British created two killing fields, the first for artillery (targeting twelve Japanese crossing points along the highway) and the second using aircraft (which were able to fly even in poor weather conditions) to attack those who managed to cross the road, especially between the Sittang and the Salween rivers.<ref name=autogenerated/> Foo's were both used in [[Air Observation Post|the air]] and the ground and in addition armor and infantry both motorized and on foot covered the gaps between the positions despite the heavy [[monsoon]] rains. The now-Allied Patriotic Burma Forces would deal with any survivors on the east bank of the Sittang.<ref name=autogenerated3/><ref name=autogenerated0/>

As such [[55th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|55th Division]] ran straight into British 19th Indian Division's strong point at [[Penwegon]]; tanks and infantry repelled every single attack inflicting huge losses.<ref name=autogenerated3/> British forward observation officers on the far side of the Sittang continued to call down artillery fire on the Japanese as the survivors attempted to reform and move south; casualties were appalling and it was in reality a one sided battle.<ref name=autogenerated1/> The RAF had also attacked troop concentrations and river craft of all kinds; [[No. 273 Squadron RAF|273]] and [[No. 607 Squadron RAF|607]] Squadrons killed about 500 Japanese in the village of [[Hpa-An]] when British and Burmese troops came in to take control.<ref name=autogenerated2/>

Meanwhile the 600 strong Japanese 13th Naval Guard Force personnel due to confusion and ambushes broke out separately from the main body and were effectively wiped out, only a handful surviving.<ref name=autogenerated0/>

On 21st July the Japanese began the last and most desperate attempt to cross the Sittang with the remaining 15,000 troops, many of whom were sick. [[IJA 54th Division|54th Division]] having suffered heavily from [[cholera]] and [[dysentery]], stepped off from the Pegu Yoma and crossed the flooded paddy fields to the Sittang.<ref name=autogenerated/> Every available allied tank, artillery, mortar and machine gun was at once thrown in against them, and despite low clouds and heavy rains, every squadron which was able to sortie.<ref name=autogenerated3/> The Thunderbolt could carry three 500 pound bombs and the Spitfire one 500 pound bomb and in squadrons these played havoc among concentrations of moving Japanese troops. Many incidents occurred where RAF ground observers exposed themselves to [[friendly fire]]; a visual Controller by the name of Flight Lieutenant J. Taylor, who was able to direct around seventeen aircraft at a time on to targets only 250 yards from his post. However both he and a corporal were wounded from shell splinters dropped by RAF fighter bombers.<ref name=autogenerated2/> With British guns, in particular the devastation caused by the [[BL 5.5-inch Medium Gun|5.5 inch]], [[BL 4.5-inch Medium Field Gun|4.5 inch]] and the [[Ordnance QF 25-pounder|25 pounder]]s already targeting the routes; the Japanese were effectively slaughtered and this would last until the end of July.<ref name=autogenerated1/><ref name=autogenerated3/>

===Last Actions===
Nearing the end of July the last desperate offensive of the Japanese had been brought to a halt, the Japanese 15th army then stepped in to help the shattered survivors of the 28th army. The [[Karen people|Karen]] guerrillas, were able to ambush hundreds of the escaping Japanese and attack elements from the 15th army. [[Force 136]], operated with them and used [[Westland Lysander]]s, removing the seriously wounded, prisoners, documents and bringing in urgent stores.<ref name=autogenerated0/> They provided targets not only for Spitfires and Thunderbolts, but called on the [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]]s and [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito's]] of the Tactical Air Force. In the process they impeded the Japanese in the race to get to [[Taungoo]] and inflicted the loss of 700 Japanese.<ref name=autogenerated2/> By the 29th July, Fifteenth army pulled back realizing that the breakout was a disaster but had succeeded in at least rescuing a number of scattered groups.<ref name=autogenerated3/>

By the time the battle had died down only a few Japanese units made it across, having reached the Sittang by 7th August before the whole area was cleared by allied infantry.<ref name=autogenerated1/>

==Aftermath==
[[File:The British Army in Burma 1945 SE4444.jpg|250px|thumb|Japanese prisoners from the battle are searched, 30 July 1945.]]
The breakout was a dismal failure and sapped the Japanese morale even further, the ragged elements were continually harassed by Karen guerrillas and the RAF.<ref name=autogenerated/> Even so, Messervy and Stopford described the breakout as a heroic effort and that most of the 660 prisoners were taken only because they were incapable of further effort highlighting the tenacity of the Japanese soldier even when starved and disease ridden.<ref>Hearn pg. viii</ref>

Of the Japanese losses the unit that suffered the lowest percentage of casualties was Matsui's 105th Independent Mixed Brigade; of 4173 men more than 2000 of them got across the Sittang. On the other hand, 13th Naval Guard Force was annihilated, with only a handful of its original 600 men escaping. A substantial number, at least 70 and perhaps more, deserted while still in the Pegu Yomas; this suffered the heaviest casualties of any formation in this costly operation. The 54th had suffered huge losses, more than 5000 were lost breaking out across the Sittang. Meanwhile the 55th division; 9000 men that started the breakout, less than 4000 made it to the [[Tenasserim Hills|Tenasserim]].<ref name=autogenerated1/> Out of 18,000 men of the 28th Army less than 6,000 in total managed to breakout and reach the east bank of the Sittang.<ref name=autogenerated3/> The British and allied forces in addition to having claimed 1,500 being sick to disease throughout the period had suffered no more than 95 men killed and 322 wounded although a small number of this was from 'friendly fire'.<ref name=autogenerated/>

The Royal Air Force flew a total of 3,045 sorties and dropped some 750 tons of bombs. The loss of so many Japanese troops was largely due to British air power and artillery fire and caused the majority of Japanese casualties and was known as a 'gunners war'.<ref name=autogenerated1/><ref name=autogenerated2/>

With this defeat the Japanese Burma Area Army was reduced to an ineffective fighting force even further. With the majority of Burma now liberated word that Japan had surrendered on August 15th only increased the anxiety of the Japanese to get to the Tenasserim hills.<ref name=autogenerated3/> They did not however wish to be immobilized on the eastern bank of the Sittang so another 2,000 more died after the battle had been fought, many in the first days of peace. The battle signified the last major pitched battle on land of World War II involving the Western allies.<ref>Tucker pg. 60</ref>

On 13 September 1945 the last remaining units of the once formidable Japanese Burma area army surrendered to the British.<ref name=autogenerated1/><ref>Topich & Leitich pg. 69</ref>
