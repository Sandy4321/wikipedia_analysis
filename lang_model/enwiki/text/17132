The '''characters of ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]''''', an ongoing 2011 American fairytale/drama series created by [[Edward Kitsis]] and [[Adam Horowitz (screenwriter)|Adam Horowitz]], are classic [[fairy tale]] characters from the [[Enchanted Forest]] who are cursed to remain trapped by time in Storybrooke, [[Maine]]. They are forced to live forever without happy endings, and most of them cannot remember their true identites.

The series revolves around lonely [[bail bondsman|bail bond agent]] [[#Emma Swan|Emma Swan]] who is reunited with [[#Henry Mills|Henry Mills]], the son she gave up for adoption ten years before. Not wanting a relationship with him, Emma drives him home to Storybrooke. On the way, he tells her that all of the stories in his large book of fairy tales are real: everyone in Storybrooke are characters from the book and are cursed by the [[#Evil Queen|Evil Queen]] and that as the daughter of [[#Snow White|Snow White]] and [[#Prince Charming|Prince Charming]] Emma is the only one who can release them. She returns Henry to his adoptive mother Regina Mills, the town's mayor and the Evil Queen. Regina's antagonistic attitude causes Emma to become suspicious of her and she moves into town. Inadvertently, she starts breaking the curse. The rest of the cast are Storybrooke citizens whose true fairy tale identities are revealed through flashbacks to events in the Enchanted Forest: Mary Margaret Blanchard, Henry's teacher and truly Snow White; David Nolan, who wakes up from his coma to find that his false memories of his wife [[#Kathryn Nolan|Kathryn Nolan]] conflict the feelings he as Prince Charming has for Snow White; [[#Mr. Gold|Mr. Gold]], the town's wealthiest and most feared resident, reflecting his identity as Rumplestiltskin; [[#Archie Hopper|Archie Hopper]], Jiminy Cricket living as the town's [[psychotherapist]]; [[#Sheriff Graham|Sheriff Graham]], the huntsman sent out to kill Snow White; [[#August W. Booth|August Booth]], a deathly ill writer who needs magic to recover and the first stranger in town after Emma; and many other fairy tale characters, including two characters that would later become part of the ongoing storylines, [[#Belle|Belle]], the love interest of Mr. Gold, and [[#Red Riding Hood|Ruby]], the waitress whose past is that of Red Riding Hood and her alter ego, the Wolf.

She is also dismissive of her husband [[#Henry|Henry]] and believes he coddles Regina too much. She uses her magical powers to force Regina to submit to her demands. Cora causes a child [[#Snow White|Snow White]]'s horse to become wild, knowing that Regina would save Snow. Cora then uses this opportunity to arrange a marriage between Regina and Snow's father [[#King Leopold|King Leopold]].

Shortly after, she magically pulls Daniel's heart and kills him. Cora tells a heartbroken Regina that love is an illusion and that only power is real. She also states that she made too many deals and sacrifices to let Regina pass up the chance to be queen.<ref name="TheStableBoy"/> The fate of Cora, since her first appearance, has not yet been revealed, but Hershey will return in future episodes as Regina's mother in the second season.
