'''William Thomas Roden''' was a nineteenth-century English artist.

==Life==
William Thomas Roden was born in Bradford Street, [[Birmingham]], England, and apprenticed to a Mr. Tye, an engraver. On Tye's recommendation, Roden moved to London to become an apprentice to [[George Thomas Doo]]. He continued to practise engraving for about ten years. Later he returned to Birmingham, where he found success as a portrait painter. For many years he painted nearly all the presentation portraits that were wanted in the town.<ref>Hill, J., Harper, Midgley, W., ''The history of the Royal Birmingham Sociey of Artists, with a Chapter of personal reminiscence by Edward S. Harper'' Birmingham: Cornish Brothers, 1929, p.40</ref>

He died on Christmas Day 1892, at his sister's house in [[Handsworth]], after a long illness.

==Career==

William Thomas Roden exhibited in London between 1843<U+2013>79, including six works at the [[Royal Academy]], two at the British Institute (1806<U+2013>67), and four at the [[Society of British Artists|Royal Society of British Artists]].

He was a prominent figure within the [[Royal Birmingham Society of Artists]]. He exhibited between 1843-1887 and was a member for 25 years, from 1848<U+2013>1873. In total, Roden exhibited 86 works at the RBSA Gallery, including 65 portraits (presumably all commissions, since none for sale); a few landscapes; paintings of biblical, literary, or classical subject matter; and some engravings.<ref name="Morris">S. Morris & K. Morris, ''A Catalogue of Birmingham and West Midlands Painters of the Nineteenth Century'', Six Bells, Warwickshire, 1985</ref>

In 1867 Roden was made the Director of the Life Academy. He held the position for two years, before swapping to become the Director of the Costume Academy instead. In 1872 he resigned from this position, and left the society completely in 1873.

==Works==
In the Birmingham council house, among other portraits by Roden, there was one of [[William Ewart Gladstone]]; in the Art Gallery portraits of [[John Henry Newman]], [[Samuel Lines]] the painter and engraver, [[Peter Hollins]] the sculptor, and [[John Henry Chamberlain]] the architect; and at [[Aston Hall]] portraits of Dr. Lloyd and [[Sir John Ratcliff]]. Other portraits were in the General Hospital, and for [[Saltley College]] he painted a portrait of [[George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton]]. He also painted two portraits of [[Lord Palmerston]] from life. He rarely exhibited works at the London exhibitions.

Eighteen of Roden's portraits in oils are owned by the [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]].<ref name="Morris" />

A engraving by Roden, entitled ''Head of Woman'', was presented to the Society by fellow RBSA member Samuel Henry Baker (1824 <U+2013> 1909) after Roden<U+2019>s death, which has since been identified as being after [[Coreggio|Antonio da Correggio]]<U+2019>s [http://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaizdas:Correggio_-_Madonna_of_the_Basket_-_WGA05326.jpg ''Madonna of the Basket''].
