'''George Gibson Macaulay''' (7 December, 1897 <U+2013> 13 December, 1940), was a professional English [[cricket]]er who played [[first-class cricket]] for [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]] between 1920 and 1935. He played in eight [[Test cricket|Test matches]] for [[England cricket team|England]] from 1923 to 1933, achieving the rare feat of taking a wicket with his first [[Delivery (cricket)|ball]] in Test cricket.  One of the five [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] in 1924,  he took 1,838 first-class [[Wicket#dismissal|wickets]] at an [[Bowling average|average]] of 17.64 including four [[Hat-trick#Cricket|hat-tricks]]. 

A leading member of the Yorkshire team which achieved a high level of success in the time he played, Macaulay was a volatile character who played aggressively. He left a job at a bank to become a professional cricketer, making his first-class debut aged 23 as a [[Fast bowling|fast bowler]].  Meeting limited success, he altered style to deliver [[off spin]] in addition to his pace bowling. This proved so effective that he was chosen to play for England in Test matches. However, his perceived poor attitude towards the game, and an unsuccessful match in the 1926 Ashes probably prevented him playing more Tests. His form slumped following injuries in the late 1920s, but a recovery in the early 1930s led to a recall by England, although he broke down in his second match back. Another injury in 1934 made cricket difficult for him and his first-class career ended in 1935, although he continued playing club cricket until the Second World War. A pilot officer in the [[Royal Air Force]], he died of illness on active service in the Second World War.

==Early life==
Macaulay was born in [[Thirsk]] on 7 December 1897. His father ran a [[public house]] in the town and was a well-known local cricketer, as were his uncles.<ref name=coy/> Macaulay was educated at [[Barnard Castle School|Barnard Castle]]; in later years, he took teams of famous cricketers to play annual matches against the school eleven.<ref name=obit>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/229833.html| title = ''Wisden'' <U+2013> Obituaries during the war, 1940| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1941 | publisher = John Wisden & Co. | location = London | accessdate = 27 February 2010}}</ref> He displayed all-round ability at sport, including golf and swimming. His greatest successes came in cricket and football: he played cricket for Thirsk Victoria before moving to play for [[Wakefield]] and [[Ossett]]; in the latter town, he played as a professional.<ref name=W306>Woodhouse, p. 306.</ref> In the First World War, Macaulay served with the [[Royal Field Artillery]] and afterwards worked as a bank clerk in [[Herne Bay, Kent]], playing club cricket in his spare time.<ref name=W306/><ref name=coy>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154717.html| title = ''Wisden'' <U+2013> George Macaulay| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1924 | publisher = John Wisden & Co. | location = London | accessdate = 27 February 2010}}</ref>

==Playing career==
===Yorkshire debut===
In 1920, [[Yorkshire CCC|Yorkshire]] needed to strengthen its bowling attack. Of the team's previously successful bowlers, [[Major Booth]] had been killed in the war, [[Alonzo Drake]] had died soon afterwards from illness, and [[George Hirst]] was past his best. Although [[Wilfred Rhodes]] was able to ease the shortfall by resuming his career as a frontline [[spin bowling|spin bowler]], Yorkshire needed new bowlers, particularly [[fast bowlers|pacemen]].<ref name=coy/><ref>{{cite book|last = Rogerson|first = Sidney|title = Wilfred Rhodes|publisher = Hollis and Carter|year = 1960|location= London|pages= 120<U+2013>21}}</ref> Macaulay had been spotted playing club cricket by Sir [[Stanley Christopherson]], a former [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] player.<ref name=W306/> Subsequently, [[Harry Hayley]], a 19th-century Yorkshire cricketer, saw Macaulay in action and was sufficiently impressed to recommend him for a trial with the county.<ref name=coy/> At the beginning of the [[1920 English cricket season|1920 season]], Macaulay played in two warm-up games for Yorkshire, taking six [[wicket (cricket)|wickets]] for 52 [[Run (cricket)|runs]] in a one-day game and four for 24 and two for 19 in a two-day game.<ref group="note">Bowling figures are given in the form of six for 52; the first figure refers to how many wickets the bowler took in the innings and the second figure shows how many runs he gave away.

Even so, he decided to become a professional cricketer. Hirst and Rhodes persuaded him to reduce his pace and concentrate on bowling a [[line and length|good length]] while trying to spin the ball. He practised through the winter of 1920<U+2013>21 to be ready for the next season.<ref name=obit/><ref name=coy/>

Bowling a mixture of medium pace and his new style of [[off spin]],<ref name=Crusoe136/> Macaulay played 27 matches in 1921. After taking wickets steadily at the start of the season, in his fourth game he took six wickets for ten runs as [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] were bowled out for 72. Four more wickets in the second innings gave Yorkshire a big victory and Macaulay had match figures of ten wickets for 65 runs, the first time he had taken ten wickets in a match.<ref name=figures/> After a quiet spell of seven innings in which he managed no more than two wickets, Macaulay came to wider public attention by taking six wickets for three runs to bowl out Derbyshire for 23 runs.<ref name=obit/><ref name=figures/> He later took ten wickets in the match against Surrey in a losing cause, part of a sequence of three innings in which he took at least five wickets.<ref name=figures/> In all, he took 101 first-class wickets at an average of 17.33,<ref name=fcbowling/> placing him third in the Yorkshire bowling averages.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1921_f_Bowling_by_Average.html| title = First-class Bowling for Yorkshire in 1921| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 27 February 2010}}</ref> With the bat, he scored 457 runs at an average of 22.59, surprising commentators with his ability.<ref name=fcbatting/> This included a maiden first-class [[Century (cricket)|century]] against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]]. His innings of 125 [[not out]] took Yorkshire from 211 for seven wickets when he came in to bat (228 for eight soon after) to a total of 438 for nine [[Declaration and forfeiture#Declaration|declared]], a lead of 264; Yorkshire went on to a comfortable win.<ref name=coy/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/10/10228.html| title = Nottinghamshire v Yorkshire in 1921| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 28 February 2010}}</ref> His overall success in the season meant that his place in the team was secure.<ref name=coy/>

While he took only one wicket in the second innings, his first three innings had given him 17 wickets for 43 runs.<ref name=figures/> He continued to pick up wickets, but his most significant performance came in June. In front of [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (M.C.C.) members at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]], he took five for 31 as [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] were bowled out for 138.

Without naming Macaulay as one of them, he noted that [[Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke|Lord Hawke]], the Yorkshire president, believed Macaulay should have been in the team to Australia, and that "it was entirely his own fault he was not chosen."<ref name=SP>{{Cite web| last = Pardon| first = Sydney | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/68222.html| title = Notes by the Editor| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1925| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | location = London | accessdate = 1 March 2010}}</ref> It is also possible that during a match at this time, Macaulay openly criticised the captaincy and bowling of [[Arthur Gilligan]], the England captain.<ref>Marshall, p. 106. Marshall claims that the incident took place in the 1924 Lord's Test, but Macaulay did not play in that game.</ref>

During the winter of 1924<U+2013>25, Macaulay opened cricket [[outfitter]]s in Leeds and Wakefield with his Yorkshire team-mate [[Herbert Sutcliffe]]. Macaulay quickly lost interest, and the partnership was dissolved a year later, but Sutcliffe made the lone venture a success.<ref>Hill, pp. 77<U+2013>78.</ref>

===Mid-1920s career===
Macaulay's most successful season in terms of wickets was 1925, despite a very dry summer which produced a succession of good batting pitches. He took 211 wickets at an average of 15.48, coming top of the Yorkshire averages.<ref name=fcbowling/><ref name=rog/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1925_f_Bowling_by_Average.html| title = First-class Bowling for Yorkshire in 1925| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 8 March 2010}}</ref> On seven occasions he took seven wickets in an innings, his best figures being seven for 13 in 24 [[Over (cricket)|overs]] against Derbyshire.<ref name=figures/> One of his highest profile performances came for Yorkshire against Sussex, who were chasing 263 to win the game. Just after [[List of cricket terms#L|lunch]] on the final day, the score was 223 for three wickets; Macaulay delivered a [[List of cricket terms#S|spell]] of five wickets for eight runs in 33 balls to bowl out his opponents and finish with figures of seven for 67.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Remarkable Bowling by Macaulay (subscription required) | newspaper = The Times  | location = London  | page =  6  | date = 19 August 1925  | url = http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?toDate=1925-08-19&fromDate=1925-08-19&currentPageNumber=1&resultsPerPage=10&sortBy=default&offset=0&viewName=&addFilters=&removeFilters=&addCat=&queryKeywords=Macaulay&sectionId=1040&currPgSmartSet=1&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1925-08-19-06&articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1925-08-19-06-001&origPageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1925-08-19-06&origArticleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1925-08-19-06-001&xmlpath=&pubId=17&totalResults=1&addRefineFilters=&removeRefineFilters=&addRefineCat=&additionalKeyword=&next_Page=false&prev_Page=false&date_dd_From=19&date_mm_From=08&date_yyyy_From=1925&date_dd_to_range=19&date_mm_to_range=08&date_yyyy_to_range=1925&date_dd_from_precise=19&date_mm_from_precise=08&date_yyyy_from_precise=1925&isDateSearch=false&dateSearchType=range&refineQuerykeywordText=  | accessdate = 12 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/11/11685.html| title = Yorkshire v Sussex in 1925| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 15 March 2010}}</ref> He took five or six wickets in a further eleven innings and took ten or more wickets against Nottinghamshire, Worcestershire, the M.C.C. and in consecutive matches against Hampshire and Surrey.

Macaulay was selected for the third Test against Australia at Headingley, possibly because [[Arthur Carr (cricketer)|Arthur Carr]], the England captain, expected the pitch to favour spinners. The Australians were concerned that Macaulay represented a threat to their batting, but the match did not work out in Macaulay's favour as a bowler; having been dropped at the start of play, [[Charlie Macartney]] played what ''Wisden'' called one of the best innings of his career and vigorously attacked the England bowling, achieving the rare feat of scoring a century before the lunch interval. The Australian batsman had asked his captain if he could attack Macaulay in particular, and the Yorkshire bowler suffered as Macartney quickly dominated him. Macaulay eventually had Macartney caught after hitting a [[bouncer (cricket)|short ball]] in the air, but it was Macaulay's only success in the innings. Macaulay conceded 123 runs in 32 overs as Australia scored 494.<ref name=Ashes26>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151709.html| title = England v Australia 1926| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1927| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | location = London | accessdate = 10 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| last = Cardus | first = Neville | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152670.html| title = Charles Macartney and George Gunn| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1959| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | location = London | accessdate = 14 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Roland |last=Perry |authorlink=Roland Perry| title=Bradman's best Ashes teams: Sir Donald Bradman's selection of the best ashes teams in cricket history| year=2002 |location=Milsons Point, New South Wales |publisher=[[Random House|Random House Australia]] | isbn=1-74051-125-5| pages=110<U+2013>12}}</ref> When Macaulay came into bat from number ten in the [[Batting order (cricket)|batting order]], England were 182 for eight wickets and facing defeat. He played an attacking innings of 76, hitting ten fours, in a partnership of 108 with [[George Geary]].

He took seven wickets in one other innings, and managed five or six wickets in another twelve, while he also passed ten wickets in matches against Leicestershire, Glamorgan and Middlesex.<ref name=figures/> Apart from his success in the Test match, Macaulay scored another two fifties and a century against [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]].<ref name=figures/><ref name=fcbatting/>

===Decline===
Over the next four seasons, Yorkshire failed to win the Championship, although they never finished lower than fourth in the table.<ref>Woodhouse, pp. 344, 350, 358, 366<U+2013>67.</ref> The team displayed an unaccustomed weakness in bowling, particularly after the death of [[Roy Kilner]] in 1928. The effectiveness of the main bowlers was reduced by age and injury; only Macaulay remained at something approaching his bowling peak.<ref>Woodhouse, pp. 358, 367.</ref> However, his performances worsened each year. His bowling figures in the 1927 season were similar to his achievements in 1926, showing only a slight decline, but his total of wickets fell each season until 1930.<ref name=fcbowling/>

In 1927, Macaulay took 130 wickets at an average of 18.26.<ref name=fcbowling/> However, he suffered a foot injury in 1928, and took time to recover his best form.<ref>Hodgson, p. 122.</ref> His wicket tally fell to 120 and his average climbed to 24.37.<ref name=fcbowling/> His total of wickets decreased further to 102 in 1929 and his average remained above 20. Hampered by another foot injury throughout 1930, Macaulay failed to take 100 wickets for the first time since his debut season; his average of 25.12 was the highest of his career.<ref name=fcbowling/><ref>Hodgson, p. 128.</ref> The number of innings in which Macaulay took more than half the wickets fell to eleven in 1927 and 1928 and further to four in 1929 and 1930. Similarly, the number of matches in which he took ten wickets fell to one or two each season between 1927 and 1930.<ref name=fcbowling/> In these seasons, he was only selected for one representative match, a Test trial in 1928 in which he failed to take a wicket.<ref name=figures/> Even so, his bowling figures kept him near the top of the Yorkshire bowling averages. He was top in 1927 and in the leading four for the next two seasons.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1927_f_Bowling_by_Average.html| title = First-class Bowling for Yorkshire in 1927| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 10 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1928_f_Bowling_by_Average.html| title = First-class Bowling for Yorkshire in 1928| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 10 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1929_f_Bowling_by_Average.html| title = First-class Bowling for Yorkshire in 1929| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 10 March 2010}}</ref> However, in 1930 he dropped to sixth.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1930_f_Bowling_by_Average.html| title = First-class Bowling for Yorkshire in 1930| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 10 March 2010}}</ref> At the same time, his batting faded. In 1927, Macaulay scored his highest run aggregate and passed fifty six times while hitting 678 runs at an average of 25.11. He improved his batting average in 1928, accumulating 517 runs at 25.85 with four more fifties. However, after 1928, he never averaged more than 16.26 with the bat and only scored two more fifties in his career, both in 1929.<ref name=fcbatting/>

==End of first-class career==
===Return to form===
From the 1931 season, Yorkshire once again dominated the County Championship, winning three consecutive trophies.<ref name=ccwin/> A large part of the success was an increase in bowling strength.<ref name=W368/> In 1931, Macaulay slightly increased his haul of wickets from 91 to 97, but his average dropped from 25.12 to 15.75.<ref name=fcbowling/> This placed him third in the Yorkshire averages, behind [[Hedley Verity]] and [[Bill Bowes]], who both took over 100 wickets and led a very strong bowling attack.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1931_f_Bowling_by_Average.html| title = First-class Bowling for Yorkshire in 1931| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 14 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=W368>Woodhouse, p. 368.</ref> That season, Macaulay was awarded a [[Benefit (sports)|benefit match]] against Surrey which raised <U+00A3>1,633,<ref name=obit/><ref>Bowes, p. 72.</ref> worth approximately <U+00A3>82,700 in 2008.<ref>Calculated using the Retail Price Index in <U+00A3> at, {{Cite web  |author=Lawrence H.

The 1933 season signalled a return to form for Macaulay. He bowled more overs that anyone else in the team and passed 100 wickets in the season for the first time since 1929, the tenth and final time he did so, taking 148 wickets at an average of 16.45.<ref name=fcbowling/><ref name=H136>Hodgson, p. 136.</ref> On four occasions, he took seven wickets in an innings, including his best figures: seven for nine against Northamptonshire as the team was bowled out for 27. He finished the match with thirteen for 34.<ref name=figures/> Another seven wicket haul came in the match against Lancashire, when his match figures were twelve for 49, including a hat-trick in a sequence of four wickets in five balls.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/14/14626.html| title = Lancashire v Yorkshire in 1933| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 15 March 2010}}</ref> He also took twelve wickets against Leicestershire.<ref name=figures/> His form won a recall to the Test side after seven years. Not picked initially, a decision described by ''Wisden'' as unfair, he played in the first Test when [[Edward Clark (cricketer)|Nobby Clark]] dropped out of the team before the match.<ref name=WI33>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151775.html| title = England v West Indies 1933| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1934| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | location = London | accessdate = 14 March 2010}}</ref> Macaulay took one wicket in the first innings but had figures of four for 57 in the second innings to earn approval from ''Wisden''.<ref name=figures/><ref name=WI33/> He was picked for the second Test but bowled only 14 overs before injuring his foot when fielding; he was unable to take any further part in the game.<ref name=figures/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151776.html| title = England v West Indies 1933| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1934| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | location = London | accessdate = 14 March 2010}}</ref> He did not play in the third Test but was selected in festival game at Scarborough for the team selected from the M.C.C. party which toured Australia in the previous winter.

===Final seasons===
Macaulay's final two seasons were affected by injury, as he was increasingly bothered by [[rheumatism]].<ref>Hodgson, p. 138.</ref> In the 1934 season, while trying to take a catch, he injured the finger he used to spin the ball.<ref name=obit/> He did not appear for Yorkshire until June,<ref name=fcmatch>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/426/First-Class_Matches.html| title = First-Class Matches played by George Macaulay| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 27 February 2010}}</ref> but went on to take 55 wickets at an average of 23.43.<ref name=fcbowling/> The next season was his final one. He only played nine matches,<ref name=fcbatting/> taking 22 wickets at 20.09.<ref name=fcbowling/> At the end of the year, he retired from first-class cricket and Yorkshire awarded him a special grant of <U+00A3>250.<ref name=obit/> Yorkshire did have a replacement in mind; [[Frank Smailes]] was considered to be versatile enough in his bowling style to take Macaulay's place,<ref name=H136/> but it was not until [[Ellis Robinson]] secured a place in 1937 that a new specialist off-spinner was found.<ref>Hodgson, p. 145.</ref>

Macaulay ended his career with 1,837 first-class wickets at an average of 17.65. In eight Test matches, he took 24 of those wickets at an average of 27.58. In addition, he scored 6,055 runs at an average of 18.07 and held 373 catches.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/16857.html| title = George Macaulay| publisher = ESPNCricinfo| accessdate = 14 March 2010}}</ref> He took 100 wickets in a season ten times, a record only surpassed by four others for Yorkshire, while only three other Yorkshire bowlers have taken 200 wickets in a season.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Records/Firstclass/Bowling_Records/Most_Season_Wickets.html| title = Most wickets in a Season for Yorkshire| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 12 June 2010}}</ref> He also took four [[Hat-trick#Cricket|hat-tricks]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Records/Firstclass/Bowling_Records/Hat_Tricks_For.html

===Post-Yorkshire career===
Macaulay continued to play league cricket in Wales and Yorkshire. In 1938 and 1939, he played in the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]] as the professional for [[Todmorden Cricket Club|Todmorden]], for whom he took nine wickets for 10 runs against [[Ramsbottom Cricket Club|Ramsbottom]] in the [[Worsley Cup]] final. Ramsbottom were bowled out for 47 to give Macaulay's team a 26-run win.<ref name=obit/><ref>Woodhouse, pp. 306<U+2013>07.</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16818.html | title = Todmorden v Ramsbottom in 1938| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 15 March 2010}}</ref>

He joined the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) at the start of the Second World War, was stationed at [[Church Fenton]] and reached the rank of [[Pilot Officer]]. While on duty in the [[Shetland Islands]], he contracted pneumonia and died at the RAF station at [[Sullom Voe]] on 13 December 1940. He was buried in [[Lerwick]] Cemetery on [[Shetland]].<ref>Woodhouse, p. 307.</ref><ref>Swanton, p. 61.</ref>

==Style and personality==
As a batsman, Macaulay was reasonably good and possibly better than his statistics would suggest. He was capable of batting well in a crisis but may have been prevented from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling.<ref name=W306/> He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team.<ref>Marshall, p. 38.</ref> Macaulay's fielding was also very effective. He was excellent at close range to the batsmen,<ref name=obit/> particularly from his own bowling.<ref name=W306/>

As a bowler, Macaulay fulfilled two roles. At the start of an innings, when the [[Cricket ball|ball]] was new and hard, he [[Fast bowling#Deployment of bowlers|opened the bowling]] with [[fast bowling|medium-fast]] deliveries that [[outswinger|swung away from]] from right-handed batsmen. In this style, he was very accurate and bowled a variety of deliveries to unsettle his opponents. Cricket writer [[R. C. Robertson-Glasgow]] considered him to be better than any similar bowler in the 1920s except [[Maurice Tate]], the leading medium paced bowler in England.<ref name=Crusoe136>Robertson-Glasgow, p. 136.</ref> Macaulay could vary his pace from medium to fast depending on the needs of the match situation and the type of pitch.<ref name=Crusoe135>Robertson-Glasgow, p. 135.</ref> When the pitch was suitable for spinning the ball, he bowled medium-paced [[Off spin|off breaks]].<ref name=Crusoe136/> ''Wisden'' said that his spin made him more effective than other bowlers of his speed on a [[Sticky wicket#Origins|sticky wicket]], a pitch which has been affected by rain, making it erratic and difficult to bat on.<ref name=coy/> His obituary further stated: "Under suitable conditions for using the off-break, batsmen seemed at his mercy."<ref name=obit/> This was because he could bowl deliveries which were almost impossible for batsmen to play without getting out, but at the same time it was very difficult to score runs against him.<ref name=obit/> Robertson-Glasgow wrote that "on a rain-damaged pitch he was in his glory."<ref name=Crusoe136/> He would make small adjustments to the positions of his fielders or bowl from different sides of the wicket, often making gestures or facial expressions as he did so. Robertson-Glasgow said that "only the best could survive the onslaught except by a miracle",<ref name=Crusoe136/> and described Macaulay as a great bowler.<ref name=Crusoe135/> His bowling action was relaxed and effortless, being admired by his contemporaries.<ref name=obit/><ref name=Crusoe135/> However, critics and team-mates more widely knew him as passionate, hostile and fiery when bowling.<ref name=H109/> He knew many tricks to dismiss or unsettle batsmen, including the tactic of bowling the ball [[beamer (cricket)|straight at their head]] without pitching, which was usually considered dangerous and unfair.<ref>Bowes, pp. 29<U+2013>30.</ref>

Macaulay displayed a temper when matters went against him.<ref name=W306/> Robertson-Glasgow described him as an unusual man, "fiercely independent, witty, argumentative, swift to joy and anger. He had pleasure in cracking a convention or cursing an enemy ... A cricket-bag came between him and his blazer hanging on a peg; and he'd kick it and tell it a truth or two, then laugh."<ref name=Crusoe135/> Bill Bowes described how, when he was bowling, he would glare and mutter under his breath; he seemed to be "filled with a devilish energy".<ref>Bowes, p. 64.</ref> He would make sharp or biting comments, particularly if a fielder made a mistake when he was bowling and although often amusing, it could at times hurt the recipients, and his anger made his team-mates wary of him.<ref name=H109>Hodgson, p. 109.</ref><ref>Bowes, pp. 76<U+2013>77.</ref> Yet, he could also express appreciation when a skillful batsmen hit a good shot from his bowling; the result was that his colleagues were never sure what to expect from him, even after playing with him for years.<ref>Bowes, p. 81.</ref> [[Herbert Sutcliffe]] said he could be charming when not playing, but his wit could be sharp.<ref name=H109/> Robertson-Glasgow nevertheless described him as "a glorious opponent; a great cricketer; and a companion in a thousand."<ref name=Crusoe136/>
