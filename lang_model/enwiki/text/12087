'''Hermann Henking''' (1858 - 1942)<ref>James Wynbrandt, Mark D. Ludman, ''The Encyclopedia of Genetic Disorders and Birth Defects'', page 395, Infobase Publishing, 2009 ISBN 1438120958.</ref> was a [[cytologist]] who discovered the [[X chromosome]] in 1890 or 1891.  The work was the result of a study in Leipzig of the testicles of the [[Firebug]] ''Pyrrhocoris'' during which Henking noticed that one chromosome did not take part in [[meiosis]].  He named this ''X element'' because its strange behaviour made him unsure whether it was genuinely a chromosome.<ref>James Schwartz, ''In Pursuit of the Gene: From Darwin to DNA'', pages 155-158, Harvard University Press, 2009 ISBN 0674034910</ref>  It later became X chromosome after it was established that it was indeed a chromosome.<ref>David Bainbridge, 'The X in Sex: How the X Chromosome Controls Our Lives'', pages 3-5, Harvard University Press, 2003 ISBN 0674016211.</ref>
