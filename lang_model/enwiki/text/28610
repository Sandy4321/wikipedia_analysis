== Operations ==
[[First Capital Connect]] operates suburban services along the Hertford Loop Line between [[London King's Cross railway station|London King's Cross]] or [[Moorgate station|Moorgate]], and [[Letchworth railway station|Letchworth]], [[Stevenage railway station|Stevenage]] or [[Hertford North railway station|Hertford North]].  Occasionally, [[National Express East Coast]] trains operate non-stop along the route when diverted off the main section of the East Coast Main Line, due to engineering work. There is a siding to the north of [[Bowes Park railway station|Bowes Park]] which is occasionally used to turn around National Express East Coast trains heading for the [[Bounds Green TMD|Bounds Green Depot]].  There are also terminal platforms at [[Hertford North railway station|Hertford North]] and [[Gordon Hill railway station|Gordon Hill]], the latter acting as a terminus during peak hours only.

== Infrastructure ==
The line is about 24 miles long, is [[double track]] throughout and is [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrified]] at [[25 kV AC]] using [[overhead line equipment]]. It has a [[Loading_gauge#United_Kingdom|loading gauge]] of W9 and a line speed of 75 mph.<ref name=NRR8/>

[[Grade separation|Grade-separated]] junctions connect each end of the northbound track with the main line. All stations are long enough to accept two, 3 car (20m) [[Electric multiple unit|EMU]]'s.

== History ==
The line was opened in three stages between 1871 and 1924.
