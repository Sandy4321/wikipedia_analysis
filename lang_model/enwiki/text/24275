'''Branko Milosevic''' (21 August, 1964 in [[Osijek]], [[Croatia]]) is a  [[midfielder]] who made several appearances for the Socceroos. Milosevic was known for his fast bursts of speed, goal scoring, positioning, work rate, distribution and skill with the ball. 

===Europe===
At the age of 10, Milosevic was noticed by youth club Osijek Olympia, and at the age of 16 he was playing for the senior team of Olympia, he scored 9 goals in his first season and was quickly snubbed up by famous club [[Dinamo Zagreb]] and would play with the likes of [[Zvonimir Boban]]. He left Dinamo shortly after arriving. He then went to [[Germany]] and played for promoting club [[SSV Ulm 1846]] in the second division of the bundesliga, he impressed many as at the age of only 18 he scored 11 goals as an attacking midfielder in his first season. Milosevic left and travelled to [[Australia]] and play for [[Melbourne Croatia]](knights).<br />

===Australia===
Milosevic came to [[Australia]] in 1987 and played for Croatian side [[Melbourne Croatia]] (knights). He was an instant star; he brought so many great qualities to the [[NSL]] and was arguably the best player in [[Australia]]. He left [[Melbourne Knights]] in 1991 to move to [[Sydney]] side [[Sydney Olympic FC]] where he was one of the crowds favourite. He had a great first season and Australian coach Eddie Thompson marked him as his player of the year unfortunately he finished runner up in the [[Johnny Warren]] medal as he did a few years back while at [[Melbourne Knights]]. Milosevic left [[Sydney Olympic FC]] in 1995 because Coach David Ratcliffe dropped the Australian midfielder out of the squad without a reason, even though he was one of the best players in the team. [[West Adelaide]] where quick to offer and brought Milosevic to Adelaide. Despite being in his mid to late 30's Branko was able to change his game style and play as sweeper for [[West Adelaide SC]]. He was playing very well and kept the West Adelaide SC defense strong and organised and was then appointed [[captain]] in 1997. Milosevic then announced his retirement from the [[NSL]] in 1999 after the club announced that they were pulling out of the [[NSL]] due to financial crisis and lack of funding to the club.

===National Honour===
Milsevic made his Australian debut against [[South Korea]] in 1990. He made 15 appearances and scored 2 goals. He only played what was considered as big games such as [[Australia]] Vs [[Czechoslavakia]] in 1991, he played both home and away agianst [[Czechoslavakia]]. Milosevic scored against [[New Zealand]] in 1991, and [[North Korea]] in 1992. Perhaps his best perfromance for the Socceroos was against [[Sweden]] in 1992.

===Coaching Career===
Milosevic took up his first job as manager to [[Adelaide Olympic]] in 2000 where he was player/Coach in the premier league (2nd division), he won the league undefeated and was promoted into the super league (1st division). The following year he finished 6th in the super league. He then coached the SA state teams for a couple years before joining [[Adelaide Raiders]] in 2004 he finished 2nd in his first year in the league and 2nd in the league cup losing out to rivals White City in extra time. In 2005 he brought Carl Maynard (now Adelaide galaxy coach) as his assistant, together they finished 2nd again but at seasons end Milosevic wanted Carl to have the job as he wanted to develop the youth teams (u/19s and u/23's) at Raiders and prepare them for the 1st team in a couple of years. But things didn't work out as the club wasn<U+2019>t happy with Carl Maynard even though he had finished the 2006 season equal 2nd (3rd) after a very bad start. So in 2007 Branko took up the job again and developed an outstanding young squad which included the likes of [[Osama Malik]], [[Mimi Saric]] and Daniel Scordo (clubs rising star at only 17's years of age). Branko left the club at seasons end.
