The '''parietal lobe''' is one of the four [[Lobes of the brain|major lobes]] of the [[cerebral cortex]] in the [[brain]] of [[mammal]]s. The parietal lobe is positioned above (superior to) the [[occipital lobe]] and behind (posterior to) the [[frontal lobe]] and [[central sulcus]].

The parietal lobe integrates [[sensory system|sensory]] information among various [[sensory modality|modalities]], including spatial sense and navigation (See [[proprioception]]), the main sensory receptive area for the sense of touch (See [[somatosensation]]) in the [[somatosensory cortex]] which is just posterior to the central sulcus in the [[postcentral gyrus]],<ref>http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~lngbrain/cglidden/parietal.html</ref> and the [[dorsal stream]] of the [[visual system]]. The major sensory inputs from the skin (touch, temperature, and pain receptors) relay through the thalamus to parietal lobe.

Several portions of the parietal lobe are important in language processing. The somatosensory cortex can be illustrated as a distorted figure <U+2014> the [[cortical homunculus|homunculus]] ([[Latin language|Latin]]: "little man"), in which the body parts are rendered according to how much of the somatosensory cortex is devoted to them.<ref name="Schacter, D. L. 2009">Schacter, D. L., Gilbert, D. L. & Wegner, D. M. (2009). Psychology. (2nd ed.). New Work (NY): Worth Publishers.</ref> The superior parietal lobule and inferior parietal lobule are the primary areas of body or spatial awareness. A lesion in the superior or inferior parietal lobule leads to [[hemineglect]].

The name comes from the overlying [[parietal bone]], which is named from the Latin ''paries-'', "wall".

==Structure==
[[File:Parietal lobe animation small.gif|thumb|left|Animation. Parietal lobe (red) of left cerebral hemisphere.]]
The parietal lobe is defined by three anatomical boundaries: The [[central sulcus]] separates the parietal lobe from the [[frontal lobe]]; the [[parieto-occipital sulcus]] separates the parietal and [[occipital lobe]]s; the [[lateral sulcus]] (sylvian fissure) is the most lateral boundary, separating it from the [[temporal lobe]]; and the [[medial longitudinal fissure]] divides the two hemispheres. Within each hemisphere, the somatosensory cortex represents the skin area on the contralateral surface of the body.<ref name="Schacter, D. L. 2009"/>

Immediately posterior to the central sulcus, and the most anterior part of the parietal lobe, is the [[postcentral gyrus]] ([[Brodmann area]] 3), the primary [[somatosensory cortex|somatosensory cortical area]]. Dividing this and the [[posterior parietal cortex]] is the [[postcentral sulcus]].

The posterior parietal cortex can be subdivided into the [[superior parietal lobule]] (Brodmann areas [[Brodmann area 5|5]] + [[Brodmann area 7|7]]) and the [[inferior parietal lobule]] ([[Brodmann area 39|39]] + [[Brodmann area 40|40]]), separated by the [[intraparietal sulcus]] (IPS). The intraparietal sulcus and adjacent [[gyrus|gyri]] are essential in guidance of limb and [[saccade|eye movement]], and<U+2014>based on cytoarchitectural and functional differences<U+2014>is further divided into medial (MIP), lateral (LIP), ventral (VIP), and anterior (AIP) areas.

==Function==
The parietal lobe plays important roles in integrating sensory information from various parts of the body, knowledge of numbers and their relations,<ref>Blakemore & Frith (2005). ''The Learning Brain''.  Blackwell Publishing. ISBN 1-4051-2401-6</ref> and in the manipulation of objects. Its function also includes processing information relating to the sense of touch.<ref>Penfield, W., & Rasmussen, T. (1950). ''The cerebral cortex of a man: A clinical study of localization of function''. New York: Macmillan.</ref>  Portions of the parietal lobe are involved with visuospatial processing. Although multisensory in nature, the posterior parietal cortex is often referred to by vision scientists as the dorsal stream of vision (as opposed to the ventral stream in the [[temporal lobe]]). This dorsal stream has been called both the "where" stream (as in spatial vision)<ref name="Mishkin1982">Mishkin M, Ungerleider LG. (1982) Contribution of striate inputs to the visuospatial functions of parieto-preoccipital cortex in monkeys. Behav Brain Res. 1982 Sep;6(1):57-77.</ref> and the "how" stream (as in vision for action).<ref name="goodale1992">Goodale MA, Milner AD. Separate visual pathways for perception and action. Trends Neurosci. 1992 Jan;15(1):20-5.</ref> The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) receives somatosensory and/or visual input, which then, through motor signals, controls movement of the arm, hand, as well as eye movements.<ref name="Fogassi">Fogassi L, Luppino G. (2005).''Motor functions of the parietal lobe''. Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 15:626-631.</ref>

Various studies in the 1990s found that different regions of the posterior parietal cortex in [[Macaque]]s represent different parts of space.

This lobe is divided into two hemispheres<U+2014>left and right. The left hemisphere is involved in symbolic functions in language and mathematics. Meanwhile, the right hemisphere is specialised to carry out images and understanding of maps (i.e. spatial relationships).

==Clinical significance==
Damage to the right hemisphere of this lobe results in the loss of imagery, visualization of spatial relationships and neglect of left-side space and left side of the body. Even drawings may be neglected on the left side. Damage to the left hemisphere of this lobe will result in problems in mathematics, long reading, writing, and understanding symbols. The parietal association cortex enables individuals to read, write, and solve mathematical problems.The sensory inputs from the right side of the body go to the left side of the brain and vice-versa.

[[Gerstmann's syndrome]] is associated with lesion to the dominant (usually left) parietal lobe.<ref name="vallar2007">{{cite journal | author = Vallar G | year = 2007 | title = Spatial neglect, Balint-Homes' and Gerstmann's syndrome, and other spatial disorders | url = | journal = CNS Spectr | volume = 12 | issue = 7| pages = 527<U+2013>36 | pmid = 17603404 }}</ref> [[Balint's syndrome]] is associated with bilateral lesions. The syndrome of [[hemispatial neglect]] is usually associated with large deficits of attention of the non-dominant hemisphere. Optic ataxia is associated with difficulties reaching toward objects in the visual field opposite to the side of the parietal damage. Some aspects of optic ataxia have been explained in terms of the functional organization described above.

[[Apraxia]] is a disorder of motor control which can be referred neither to <U+201C>elemental<U+201D> motor deficits nor to general cognitive impairment. The concept of apraxia was shaped by [[Hugo Liepmann]] about a hundred years ago.<ref name='Apraxia'>{{cite journal | title = Apraxia and the Parietal Lobes | journal = [[Neuropsychologia]] | year = 2009 | first = George | last = Goldenberg | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 1449<U+2013>1459| id =  | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18692079 | accessdate = 2012-05-19 | pmid=18692079 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.07.014}}</ref><ref>[[Hugo Liepmann|Liepmann]], 1900 {{clarify|date=May 2012}}</ref>  Apraxia is predominantly a symptom of left brain damage, but some symptoms of apraxia can also occur after right brain damage.<ref name="khan2005">{{cite journal | author = Khan AZ, Pisella L, Vighetto A, Cotton F, Luaut<U+00E9> J, Boisson D, Salemme R, Crawford JD, Rossetti Y.

[[Amorphosynthesis]] is a loss of perception on one side of the body caused by a lesion in the parietal lobe. Usually, left-sided lesions cause [[agnosia]], a full-body loss of perception, while right-sided lesions cause lack of recognition of the person<U+2019>s left side and extrapersonal space. The term amorphosynthesis was coined by D. Denny-Brown to describe patients he studied in the 1950s.<ref name="Denny-Brown">Denny-Brown, D., and Betty Q. Banker. "Amorphosynthesis from Left Parietal Lesion." A.M.A. Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry 71, no. 3 (March 1954): 302-13.</ref>

Can also result in sensory impairment when one of your senses (sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste and spatial awareness) is no longer normal.

Several studies have suggested that abnormal parietal function may be associated with schizophrenia. There is a possibility that grey matter abnormalities begin in parietal and occipital lobes, progress towards the frontal regions, causing schizophrenia structural and functional alterations.<ref>Murat Yildiz et al.
