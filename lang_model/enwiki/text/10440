Both the mineral resources of the planet, as well as the products of the biosphere, contribute resources that are used to support a global human population. The inhabitants are grouped into about 200 independent sovereign states, which interact through diplomacy, travel, trade and military action. Human cultures have developed many views of the planet, including personification as a deity, a belief in a [[flat Earth]], and a modern perspective of the world as an integrated environment that requires stewardship. Humans first left the planet in 1961, when [[Yuri Gagarin]] reached outer space.

The Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the [[inorganic]] [[Carbon cycle|CO<sub>2</sub> cycle]], reducing its concentration to the lethal levels for plants (10 [[Parts-per notation|ppm]] for [[C4 carbon fixation|C4 photosynthesis]]) in 900 million years. The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, so animal life will become extinct within several million more years.<ref name=ward_brownlee/> But even if the Sun were eternal and stable, the continued internal cooling of the Earth would have resulted in a loss of much of its atmosphere and oceans due to reduced [[volcanism]].<ref>{{cite journal

===Chemical composition===
{{seealso|Abundance of elements on Earth}}
The mass of the Earth is approximately 5.98{{e|24}}&nbsp;kg. It is composed mostly of [[iron]] (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), [[silicon]] (15.1%), [[magnesium]] (13.9%), [[sulfur]] (2.9%), [[nickel]] (1.8%), [[calcium]] (1.5%), and [[aluminium]] (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to [[mass segregation]], the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%),
and less than 1% trace elements.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Morgan, J. W.; Anders, E. | title=Chemical composition of Earth, Venus, and Mercury | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Science | year=1980 | volume=71 | issue=12 | pages=6973<U+2013>6977 | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=350422 | accessdate=2007-02-04 | doi=10.1073/pnas.77.12.6973 | pmid=16592930 }}</ref>

The geochemist [[Frank Wigglesworth Clarke|F. W. Clarke]] calculated that a little more than 47% of the Earth's crust consists of oxygen. The more common rock constituents of the Earth's crust are nearly all oxides; chlorine, sulfur and fluorine are the only important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. The principal oxides are silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash and soda. The silica functions principally as an acid, forming silicates, and all the commonest minerals of igneous rocks are of this nature. From a computation based on 1,672 analyses of all kinds of rocks, Clarke deduced that 99.22% were composed of 11 oxides (see the table at right.) All the other constituents occur only in very small quantities.<ref group=note name=EB1911>{{1911|article=Petrology}}</ref>

===Internal structure===
{{main|Structure of the Earth}}
The interior of the Earth, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their [[chemical]] or [[Rheology|rheological]] properties. The Earth has an outer [[Silicate minerals|silicate]] solid [[crust]], a highly viscous mantle, a liquid [[outer core]] that is much less viscous than the mantle, and a solid [[inner core]]. The crust is separated from the mantle by the [[Mohorovi<U+010D>i<U+0107> discontinuity]], and the thickness of the crust varies: averaging 6&nbsp;km under the oceans and 30<U+2013>50&nbsp;km on the continents.<ref>{{cite book

===Tectonic plates===
{{main|Plate tectonics}}

According to plate tectonics theory, the outermost part of the Earth's interior is made up of two layers: the [[lithosphere]], comprising the crust, and the solidified uppermost part of the mantle. Below the lithosphere lies the [[asthenosphere]], which forms the inner part of the upper mantle. The asthenosphere behaves like a superheated material that is in a semi-fluidic, plastic-like state.<ref>{{cite web

 | publisher = cseligman.com | accessdate = 2008-02-28 }}</ref>

The lithosphere essentially ''floats'' on the asthenosphere and is broken up into what are called [[List of tectonic plates|tectonic plates]]. These plates are rigid segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: [[Convergent boundary|convergent]], [[Divergent boundary|divergent]] and [[Transform boundary|transform]]. The last occurs where two plates move laterally relative to each other, creating a [[strike-slip fault]]. [[Earthquake]]s, volcanic activity, [[Orogeny|mountain-building]], and [[oceanic trench]] formation can occur along these plate boundaries.<ref>{{cite web | author=Kious, W. J.; Tilling, R.

As the tectonic plates migrate across the planet, the ocean floor is [[Subduction|subducted]] under the leading edges. At the same time, upwellings of mantle material create a [[divergent boundary]] along mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes continually recycles the [[oceanic crust]]al material. Most of the ocean floor is less than 100 million years in age. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific, and has an estimated age of about 200 million years. By comparison, the oldest fossils found on land have an age of about 3 billion years.<ref>{{cite web | last = Duennebier | first = Fred

===Atmosphere===
{{main|Earth's atmosphere}}
The [[atmospheric pressure]] on the surface of the Earth averages 101.325&nbsp;[[kPa]], with a [[scale height]] of about 8.5&nbsp;km.<ref name="earth_fact_sheet"/> It is 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with trace amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules. The height of the [[troposphere]] varies with [[latitude]], ranging between 8&nbsp;km  at the poles to 17&nbsp;km  at the equator, with some variation due to weather and seasonal factors.<ref>{{cite web

Earth's biosphere has significantly altered its [[atmosphere]]. [[Oxygen evolution#Oxygen evolution in nature|Oxygenic photosynthesis]] evolved 2.7 billion years ago, [[Oxygen Catastrophe|forming]] the primarily nitrogen-oxygen [[atmosphere]] that exists today. This change enabled the proliferation of [[aerobic organisms]] as well as the formation of the ozone layer which, together with Earth's magnetic field, blocks [[ultraviolet]] [[solar radiation]], permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life on Earth include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small [[meteor]]s to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature.<ref name="atmosphere">{{cite web | author=Staff | date = 2003-10-08 | url = http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/features/912_liftoff_atm.html | title = Earth's Atmosphere | publisher = NASA | accessdate = 2007-03-21 }}</ref> This last phenomenon is known as the [[greenhouse effect]]: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane and ozone are the primary [[greenhouse gas]]es in the Earth's atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be <U+2212>18&nbsp;<U+00B0>C and life would likely not exist.<ref name="Pidwirny2006" />

====Weather and climate====
{{main|Weather|Climate}}
The Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11&nbsp;km of the planet's surface. This lowest layer is called the [[troposphere]]. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower density air then rises, and is replaced by cooler, higher density air. The result is [[atmospheric circulation]] that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of heat energy.<ref name="moran2005">{{cite web | last=Moran | first=Joseph M. | year=2005 | url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/weather_worldbook.html | title=Weather | work=World Book Online Reference Center | publisher=NASA/World Book, Inc. | accessdate=2007-03-17 }}</ref>

The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the [[trade winds]] in the equatorial region below 30<U+00B0> latitude and the [[westerlies]] in the mid-latitudes between
30<U+00B0> and 60<U+00B0>.<ref name="berger2002">{{cite web

[[Image:Air masses 2.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Source regions of global [[air mass]]es.]]
Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere.
When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and settles to the surface as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].<ref name="moran2005" /> Most of the water is then transported back to lower elevations by river systems, usually returning to the oceans or being deposited into [[lake]]s. This [[water cycle]] is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land, and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. [[Atmospheric circulation]], topological features and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.<ref>{{cite web

The Earth can be sub-divided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the [[tropics|tropical]] (or equatorial), [[Subtropics|subtropical]], [[temperate]] and [[Polar region|polar]] climates.<ref>{{cite web

Due to thermal energy, some of the molecules at the outer edge of the Earth's atmosphere have their velocity increased to the point where they can [[escape velocity|escape]] from the planet's gravity. This results in a slow but steady [[Atmospheric escape|leakage of the atmosphere into space]]. Because unfixed [[hydrogen]] has a low molecular weight, it can achieve [[escape velocity]] more readily and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gasses.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Liu, S.

===Magnetic field===
[[Image:Dipole field.svg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Earth's magnetic field]], which approximates a dipole.]]
{{main|Earth's magnetic field}}
The [[Earth's magnetic field]] is shaped roughly as a [[magnetic dipole]], with the poles currently located proximate to the planet's geographic poles. According to [[dynamo theory]], the field is generated within the molten outer core region where heat creates convection motions of conducting materials, generating electric currents. These in turn produce the Earth's magnetic field. The convection movements in the core are chaotic in nature, and periodically change alignment. This results in [[geomagnetic reversal|field reversals]] at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web | last = Fitzpatrick | first = Richard | date = 2006-02-16 | url = http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures/node69.html | title = MHD dynamo theory | publisher = NASA WMAP | accessdate = 2007-02-27 }}</ref><ref name=campbelwh>{{cite book

The field forms the [[magnetosphere]], which deflects particles in the [[solar wind]]. The sunward edge of the [[bow shock]] is located at about 13 times the radius of the Earth.

===Axial tilt and seasons===
{{main|Axial tilt}}
Because of the axial tilt of the Earth, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This results in [[season]]al change in climate, with summer in the northern hemisphere occurring when the North Pole is pointing toward the Sun, and winter taking place when the pole is pointed away. During the summer, the day lasts longer and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes generally cooler and the days shorter. Above the [[Arctic Circle]], an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year&mdash;a [[polar night]]. In the southern hemisphere the situation is exactly reversed, with the [[South Pole]] oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole.

[[Image:Earth and Moon from Mars PIA04531.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Earth and Moon from Mars, imaged by [[Mars Global Surveyor]]. From space, the Earth can be seen to go through phases similar to the [[lunar phases|phases of the Moon]].]]
By astronomical convention, the four seasons are determined by the [[solstice]]s<U+2014>the point in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun<U+2014>and the [[equinox]]es, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. Winter solstice occurs on about December 21, summer solstice is near June 21, spring equinox is around March 20 and autumnal equinox is about September 23.<ref>{{cite web

The angle of the Earth's tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. However, the tilt does undergo [[nutation]]; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6&nbsp;years. The orientation (rather than the angle) of the Earth's axis also changes over time, [[precession|precessing]] around in a complete circle over each 25,800&nbsp;year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a [[tropical year]]. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and Moon on the Earth's equatorial bulge. From the perspective of the Earth, the poles also migrate a few meters across the surface. This [[polar motion]] has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed [[quasiperiodic motion]]. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the [[Chandler wobble]]. The rotational velocity of the Earth also varies in a phenomenon known as length of day variation.<ref>{{cite web | last = Fisher | first = Rick | date = 1996-02-05 | url = http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~rfisher/Ephemerides/earth_rot.html | title = Earth Rotation and Equatorial Coordinates | publisher = National Radio Astronomy Observatory | accessdate = 2007-03-21 }}</ref>

In modern times, Earth's [[perihelion]] occurs around January 3, and the [[aphelion]] around July 4. However, these dates change over time due to [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as [[Milankovitch cycles]]. The changing Earth-Sun distance results in an increase of about 6.9%<ref>Aphelion is 103.4% of the distance to perihelion. Due to the inverse square law, the radiation at perihelion is about 106.9% the energy at aphelion.</ref> in solar energy reaching the Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Since the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that the Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. However, this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web | last = Williams | first = Jack | date = 2005-12-20 | url = http://www.usatoday.com/weather/tg/wseason/wseason.htm | title = Earth's tilt creates seasons | publisher = USAToday | accessdate = 2007-03-17 }}</ref>

The Moon is a relatively large, [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial]], planet-like satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of the Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet. ([[Charon (moon)|Charon]] is larger relative to the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]].) The natural satellites orbiting other planets are called "moons" after Earth's Moon.

The gravitational attraction between the Earth and Moon causes [[tides]] on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its [[tidal locking]]: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit the Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the [[lunar phase]]s; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the [[terminator (solar)|solar terminator]].

Because of their [[Tidal acceleration|tidal interaction]], the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately 38&nbsp;mm a year. Over millions of years, these tiny modifications<U+2014>and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23 [[Microsecond|<U+00B5>s]] a year<U+2014>add up to significant changes.<ref>{{cite web

===Biosphere===
{{main|Biosphere}}

The planet's life forms are sometimes said to form a "biosphere". This biosphere is generally believed to have begun [[evolution|evolving]] about 3.5&nbsp;billion years ago.

===Natural resources and land use===
{{main|Natural resource}}

The Earth provides resources that are exploitable by humans for useful purposes. Some of these are [[non-renewable resources]], such as [[fossil fuel|mineral fuels]], that are difficult to replenish on a short time scale.

Large deposits of [[fossil fuel]]s are obtained from the Earth's crust, consisting of [[coal]], [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]] and [[methane clathrate]]. These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral [[ore]] bodies have also been formed in Earth's crust through a process of [[Ore genesis]], resulting from actions of [[erosion]] and plate tectonics.<ref>{{cite web

Large areas are subject to extreme weather such as tropical [[cyclone]]s, [[hurricane]]s, or [[typhoon]]s that dominate life in those areas.

A [[scientific consensus]] exists linking human activities to [[global warming]] due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions.
