The '''Texas Tech Red Raiders''' are the [[College athletics|athletic]] teams that represent [[Texas Tech University]]. The women's basketball team uses the name Lady Raiders; however, the school's other women's teams use the "Red Raiders" name. The university's athletic program fields teams in 17 varsity sports and 30 club sports. The [[Masked Rider]] and [[Raider Red]] serve as the mascots representing the teams, and the school colors are scarlet and black. Texas Tech participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I]] and is a founding member of the [[Big 12 Conference]]. The teams compete as members of the Big 12 South Division.

From 1932 until 1956, the university belonged to the [[Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association]]. Texas Tech was admitted to the [[Southwest Conference]] on May 12, 1956. When the Southwest Conference disbanded in 1995, Texas Tech, along with the [[University of Texas at Austin]], [[Texas A&M University]], and [[Baylor University]], merged with the [[Big 8 Conference]] to form the Big 12.

The university's athletic director is Gerald Myers. [[Bob Knight]], the winningest coach in [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|men's Division I basketball]] history, coached the [[Texas Tech Red Raiders men's basketball|Red Raiders men's basketball]] team from 2001 to 2008. Following Bob Knight's retirement in 2008, his son [[Pat Knight]] assumed head coaching duties. The [[Red Raiders football]] team, which has been coached by [[Mike Leach]] since 2000, is a member of the [[NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision]] and has appeared in the 19th-most bowl games of any team. In 1993, lead by coach [[Marsha Sharp]], the Lady Raiders basketball team won the [[NCAA Women's Basketball Championship]]. Following Sharp's retirement in 2006, [[Kristy Curry]] was named Lady Raiders head coach. [[Texas Tech Red Raiders baseball|Red Raiders baseball]] coach [[Larry Hays]], who is one of only four coaches in [[NCAA baseball]] history to win 1,500 career games, retired in 2008. He is replaced by [[Dan Spencer]].

Basketball came to Texas Tech only two years after the school was founded. The inaugural game was a 37<U+2013>25 loss to [[Daniel Baker College]]. Tech would lose two more games before finally clinching their first ever victory<U+2014>35<U+2013>21 at [[Sul Ross University]].<ref name="History 1">{{cite web|url=http://texastech.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/archive/text-m-baskbl-a-pastres.html|title=Men's Basketball: Past Season Results|publisher=Texas Tech Athletics}}</ref><ref name="History 2">{{cite web|url=http://texastech.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/archive/text-m-baskbl-a-history.html|title=Men's Basketball: History|publisher=Texas Tech Athletics}}</ref>

[[Grady Higginbotham]] was the first coach, earning a 14<U+2013>18 record over two seasons. At .438, Higgenbotham was the only Tech basketball coach to garner an overall losing record during his stay. Following Higgenbotham's departure, [[Victor Payne]] led the Matadors (as the school's teams were known until 1936) from [[1927 in sports|1927]] to [[1930 in sports|1930]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.areavoices.com/ppundit/?blog=5209|title=The Red Raiders nickname|publisher=Prairie Pundit}}</ref> His final tally stood at 32 wins and 20 losses. [[W. L. Golightly]] coached only one season, bringing in an 11<U+2013>9 record. [[Dell Morgan]] held the head coaching job from [[1931 in sports|1931]] to [[1934 in sports|1934]], chalking up 42 wins to 29 losses. He was followed by [[Virgil Ballard]]. Though Ballard coached only a single season, it was during his time that the team won their milestone 100th game, a one-point victory over House of David. Ballard left with a 15<U+2013>9 record.<ref name="History 1" />

[[Berl Huffman]] was twice the head basketball coach at Texas Tech<U+2014>first from [[1935 in sports|1935]] to [[1942 in sports|1942]] and then from [[1946 in sports|1946]] to [[1947 in sports|1947]]. During his total of eight seasons, he garnered a record of 121&ndash;67. [[Polk Robison]] was the only other person to serve two different times as the head basketball coach at the school. When Huffman left in 1942, Robison took the job. And, when Huffman left a second time in 1947, it was Robison who again filled the position, this time remaining until [[1961 in sports|1961]]. At a total of 18 seasons, his stay is the second longest of any Red Raiders basketball coach, behind [[Gerald Myers]]. He departed after leading his teams to 254 wins, 195 losses, and the first two [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournaments]] in school history.<ref name="History 2" />

[[Gene Gibson]] followed Robison into the position. In his eight seasons, he chalked up the second worst record of any head basketball coach at Tech. Still, at 100&ndash;92, there were eight more wins than losses. [[Bob Bass]] led the program to a 22&ndash;15 record over a season-and-a-half before returning to professional basketball coaching duties.<ref name="History 2" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/news/bass_retires040505.html|title=Hornets General Manager Bob Bass Retires|publisher=[[Charlotte Hornets]]}}</ref>

[[Bob Knight]] became the men's basketball coach in [[2001 in sports|2001]]. He retired on [[February 4]], [[2008 in sports|2008]]. On New Year's Day [[2007 in sports|2007]], a 70<U+2013>68 defeat of [[New Mexico Lobos basketball|New Mexico]] by Tech marked the 880th total win for Knight, making him the winningest coach in men's college basketball history. Knight also has several other distinctions, including being the only coach to win the NCAA, the NIT, the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] Gold, and the [[Pan American Games|Pan-Am]] Gold, and has been given several awards. Knight is succeeded by his son [[Pat Knight]].

Of the varsity sports, Texas Tech has had its greatest success in women's [[basketball]]. Led by its star player [[Sheryl Swoopes]] and head coach [[Marsha Sharp]], the Lady Raiders won the [[NCAA Women's Basketball Championship]] in [[1993 in sports|1993]]. In early [[2006 in sports|2006]], Lady Raiders coach Marsha Sharp retired and was replaced on [[March 30]], [[2006 in sports|2006]] by [[Kristy Curry]], who had been the coach at [[Purdue Boilermakers|Purdue]].

The [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Red Raiders football]] team is a member of the [[NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision]] (formerly known as Division I-A). Texas Tech played its first intercollegiate football game on [[October 3]], 1925. The contest, against [[McMurry University]], ended in a controversial 0&ndash;0 tie. Tech's Elson Archibald seemed to have kicked a game-winning 20-yard field goal but the referee ruled that the clock had run out before the score. It was later reported that the referee made the call to get revenge because he wanted to be the team's first head coach but the job was instead given to [[E. Y. Freeland|Ewing Y.

==Previous nickname==
The Red Raiders were originally known as the "[[Matador|Matadors]]" from 1925&ndash;1936. As the school was thinking of an appropriate nickname for its athletic teams in 1925, the wife of the [[E. Y. Freeland|first football coach]] suggested "Matadors" to reflect the influence of the campus' [[Spanish architecture]]. The students followed the suggestion, and later chose scarlet and black as the school colors to represent a matador's traditional garb.

There are two main stories as to how the name "Red Raiders" replaced its predecessor. In one story, football coach [[Pete Cawthon]] ordered attractive scarlet uniforms to help the team's identity. The football team, wearing its new outfit, defeated heavily-favored [[Loyola Marymount]] in Los Angeles on October 26, 1934.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/big12/texas_tech/yearly_results.php?year=1930|title=Texas Tech Yearly Results|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|accessdate=2008-10-15}}</ref> A Los Angeles sports writer called the Matadors a "red raiding team". Other writers who covered Tech sports caught on with the term and successfully promoted the use of "Red Raiders". In the other tale, former ''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]'' sports columnist Collier Parris, reporting on a 1932 Tech football game, wrote: "The Red Raiders from Texas Tech, terror of the Southwest this year, swooped into the [[University of New Mexico|New Mexico University]] camp today." The name soon became popular afterward and by 1936, it officially replaced "Matadors" at the same time the [[Saddle Tramps]] came about.<ref name=03-13-08-Toreador />
