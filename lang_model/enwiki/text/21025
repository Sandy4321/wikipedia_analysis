'''Alphonse Gabriel "Al" Capone''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+00E6>|l|_|k|<U+0259>|<U+02C8>|p|o<U+028A>|n}}; January 17, 1899&nbsp;<U+2013> January 25, 1947) was an American [[gangster]] who attained fame during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition era]]. His seven-year reign as crime boss ended when he was 33 years old.

Born in the [[Brooklyn|borough of Brooklyn]] in [[New York City]] to [[Italian American|Italian immigrants]], Capone was a [[Five Points Gang]] member who became a bouncer in organized crime premises such as brothels. In his early twenties, he moved to [[Chicago]] and became bodyguard and trusted factotum for [[Johnny Torrio]], head of a criminal syndicate that illegally supplied alcohol and which was politically protected through the [[Unione Siciliane]]. A conflict with the North Side gang was instrumental in Capone's rise and fall, as Torrio had been precipitated into retirement after North Side gunmen almost killed him, thereby bringing about Capone's succession. He expanded the bootlegging business through increasingly violent means, but his mutually profitable relationships with mayor [[William Hale Thompson]] and the city's police meant Capone seemed safe from law enforcement. Apparently reveling in the attention, such as the cheers when he appeared at ball games, Capone made donations to various charities and was viewed by many to be a "modern-day [[Robin Hood]]". However, the [[Saint Valentine's Day Massacre]] of North Siders damaged Chicago's image, leading influential citizens to demand action from central government.

The federal authorities became intent on jailing Capone and prosecuted him for tax evasion in 1931. The case was  highly politicized and both prosecutors and judge later received preferment. During prior and ultimately abortive negotiations to pay the government any back tax he owed, Capone had made admissions of his income; the judge deemed these statements could be used as evidence at the trial, and also refused to let Capone plead guilty for a lighter sentence. The effect of such decisions by the judge was added to by the incompetence of Capone's defense attorneys. Capone was convicted and sentenced to a then-record-breaking 11 years in [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prison]]. Replacing his old defense team with lawyers who were experts in tax law, his appeal grounds were strengthened by a Supreme court ruling, but Capone again found that his status as a symbol of criminality meant that judges decided in his disfavor. Already showing signs of syphilitic dementia by early in his sentence, he became increasingly debilitated before being released after 8 years. On January 25, 1947, he died from [[cardiac arrest]] after suffering a [[stroke]]. Capone's conviction had negligible effect on the prevalence of organized crime in Chicago.

==Early life==
[[File:Al Capone mother.jpg|thumb|upright|Al Capone's son Albert Francis "Sonny" Capone with Al Capone's mother, Teresa]]
Alphonse (or Alfonse; which one is unknown) Gabriel Capone was born in the borough of [[Brooklyn]] in New York on January 17, 1899.<ref name="CAPONE"/> His parents, Gabriele Capone (December 12, 1864 <U+2013> November 14, 1920) and Teresina Raiola (December 28, 1867 <U+2013> November 29, 1952), were immigrants from Italy. His father was a [[barber]] from [[Castellammare di Stabia]], a town about {{convert|16|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Naples]], and his mother was a [[sewing|seamstress]] and the daughter of Angelo Raiola from [[Angri]], a town in the [[Province of Salerno]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Capone|last=Kobler|first=John|year=1971|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn= 0-306-80499-9|page= 23}}</ref>

Gabriele and Teresa had nine children: Alphonse "Scarface Al" Capone, [[James Capone]] (who later changed his name to Richard Hart and became, ironically, a Prohibition agent in [[Homer, Nebraska]]), [[Ralph Capone|Raffaele Capone]] (also known as Ralph "Bottles" Capone, who took charge of his brother's beverage industry), [[Frank Capone|Salvatore "Frank" Capone]], John Capone, Albert Capone, Matthew Capone, Rose Capone, and Mafalda Capone (who married John J. Maritote). His two brothers, [[Ralph Capone]] and [[Frank Capone]] worked with him in his empire. Frank did so until his death on April 1, 1924 and Ralph ran the bottling companies (both legal and illegal) early on, and was also the front man for the [[Chicago Outfit]] for some time until he was imprisoned for tax evasion in 1932. The Capone family immigrated to the United States, first immigrating from Italy to Fiume, [[Austria-Hungary]] (now [[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]]) in 1893, traveling on a ship to the U.S. and finally settled at 95 Navy Street,<ref name="CAPONE">{{cite book |last=Schoenberg |first=Robert L. |title= Mr. Capone|year= 1992 |publisher=William Morrow and Company|location=[[New York City|New York]], New York|isbn=0-688-12838-6| pages=18<U+2013>19|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U7VAcMdddNkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=al+capone}}</ref> in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard|Navy Yard]] section of [[downtown Brooklyn]].  Gabriele Capone worked at a nearby barber shop at 29 Park Avenue.<ref name="CAPONE"/> When Al was 11, the Capone family moved to 38 Garfield Place<ref name="CAPONE"/> in [[Park Slope]], Brooklyn.

Capone showed promise as a student, but had trouble with the rules at his strict parochial [[Catholic school]]. He dropped out of school at the age of 14, after being expelled for hitting a female teacher in the face.<ref name="Biography Channel"/> He worked at odd jobs around Brooklyn, including a candy store and a [[bowling alley]].<ref>Kobler, 27.</ref> During this time, Capone was influenced by gangster [[Johnny Torrio]], whom he came to regard as a mentor.<ref>Kobler, 26.</ref>

==Career==
After his initial stint with small-time gangs that included the Junior Forty Thieves and the Bowery Boys, Capone joined the Brooklyn Rippers and then the powerful [[Five Points Gang]] based in Lower Manhattan. During this time, he was employed and mentored by fellow racketeer [[Frankie Yale]], a [[bartender]] in a [[Coney Island]] dance hall and saloon called the Harvard Inn. After he inadvertently insulted a woman while working the door at a Brooklyn night club, Capone was slashed by her brother, Frank Gallucio. The wounds led to the nickname that Capone loathed: "Scarface".<ref name="five families book">{{cite book

===Marriage and family===
On December 30, 1918, at age 19, Capone married Mae Josephine Coughlin, who was Irish Catholic and who, earlier that month, had given birth to their first son, Albert Francis ("Sonny") Capone. As Capone was under the age of 21, his parents had to consent to the marriage in writing.<ref>{{cite book|title=Al Capone: A Biography|author=Luciano J.

===Chicago===
At about twenty years of age, Capone left New York for [[Chicago]] at the invitation of [[Johnny Torrio]], who was imported by [[Rum-running|bootlegger]] [[Jim Colosimo|James "Big Jim" Colosimo]] as an enforcer. Capone began in Chicago as bouncer in a brothel, contracting [[syphilis]], which timely use of [[Salvarsan]] probably could have cured; he apparently never sought treatment.<ref>Get Capone: The Secret Plot That Captured America's Most Wanted

Chicago's location on Lake Michigan gave access to a vast inland territory, and it was well-served by railroads. Torrio took over the crime empire of "Big Jim" Colosimo after his murder, which Capone was suspected of.<ref name="Biography Channel">{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/notorious/crimefiles.do?catId=259452&action=view&profileId=262834|title= Notorious Crime Files: Al Capone|accessdate=2010-11-12 |publisher= Biography.com|work= [[The Biography Channel]]}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first= Marilyn |last= Bardsley|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/capone/chicago_5.html|title=Chicago|accessdate=2008-04-03 |publisher= Crime Library|work= Al Capone}}</ref><ref>Kobler, 37.</ref>

With Capone as his right-hand man, Torrio headed an essentially Italian organized crime group that was the biggest in the city. Wary of being drawn into gang wars, he tried to proceed by negotiating agreements between rival crime groups over territory. The smaller, mixed ethnicity, [[North Side Gang]] of [[Dean O'Banion]] came under pressure from the Genna brothers, who were allied to Torrio. O'Banion found that for all Torrio's pretensions to be a settler of disputes, he was unhelpful with the encroachment of the Gennas into the North Side.<ref>{{cite book |title= Capone: The Man and the Era|last= Bergreen|first= Laurence|year= 1994|publisher= Simon and Schuster Paperbacks|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-684-82447-5|pages= 131<U+2013>132}}</ref> In a fateful step, Torrio had, or acquiesced to the Gennas having, the relatively business-minded O'Banion killed at his flower shop in October 1924. This placed [[Hymie Weiss]] at the head of the gang, backed by [[Vincent Drucci]] and [[Bugs Moran]]. Under Weiss, who had been a close friend of O'Banion, the North Siders treated revenge on his killers as a priority.<ref>Bergreen, pp&nbsp;134<U+2013>135</ref><ref>Bergreen, p. 138</ref><ref name="myalcaponemuseum.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id89.htm|title=Hymie Weiss|publisher=}}</ref>

===Boss===

In January 1925 Capone was ambushed, leaving him shaken but unhurt. Twelve days later, Torrio was returning from a shopping trip when he was shot several times. After recovering Torrio effectively resigned and handed over to Capone, who at 26 years old became the new boss of an organization that took in illegal breweries and a transportation network that reached to Canada, with political and law-enforcement protection, in turn he was able to use more violence to increase revenue; refusal to purchase often resulted in the premises being blown up, as many as a hundred people were killed in liquor bombings during the twenties. Rivals saw Capone as responsible for the  proliferation of brothels in the city.<ref name="myalcaponemuseum.com"/><ref>Sifakis, Carl, ''The Mafia Encyclopedia'', 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), p.362</ref><ref>Russo, Gus, ''The Outfit'', Bloomsbury (2001), pp.39,40</ref><ref>Disasters and Tragic Events,  edited by Mitchell Newton-Matza p258</ref>

Capone indulged in custom suits, cigars, gourmet food and drink (his preferred liquor was [[Templeton Rye]] from [[Iowa]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavytable.com/templeton-rye-of-templeton-iowa/|title=Templeton Rye of Templeton, Iowa|last=Walker|first=Jason|date=2009-07-07|accessdate=2010-12-04|publisher=Heavy Table| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101125042146/http://heavytable.com/templeton-rye-of-templeton-iowa/| archivedate= 25 November 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref>) and female companionship. He was particularly known for his flamboyant and costly jewelry. His favorite responses were "I am just a businessman, giving the people what they want", and "All I do is satisfy a public demand". Capone had become a national celebrity and talking point.<ref name="five families book"/>

After using bribery and widespread intimidation to take over during elections for the town council, Capone based himself in [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]], this made it difficult for the North Siders to target him.<ref name="five families book"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Added by bob armour |url=http://timelines.com/1923/al-capone-moves-his-gangs-headquarters-to-cicero-illinois |title=Al Capone moves his gang's headquarters to Cicero, Illinois |publisher=Timelines.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref> Capone's driver was found tortured and murdered, there was then an attempt on Weiss's life in the [[Chicago Loop]]. On September 20, 1926, the North Side gang used a ploy outside the Capone headquarters the Hawthorne Inn, aimed at drawing him to the windows. Gunmen in several cars then opened fire with [[Thompson submachine gun]]s and shotguns at the windows of first floor restaurant, where Capone was often found. He was unhurt, but called for a truce; the negotiations fell through. Three weeks later Weiss was killed outside the former O'Banion flower shop North Side headquarters. In January  1927, the Hawthorne's restaurant owner, a friend of Capone, was kidnapped and killed by Moran and Drucci.<ref>Russo, Gus, ''The Outfit'', Bloomsbury (2001), p.37</ref><ref name="CBS">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-5369641-504083.html |title=Al Capone's Couderay, Wisconsin Hideout Home for Sale; Asking Price $2.6M |publisher=CBS News |date=7 October 2009 |accessdate=20 March 2012}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>

Capone became increasingly security-minded and desirous of getting away from Chicago.<ref name="CBS"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-10-08/justice/wisconsin.capone.hideout.sold_1_capone-family-al-capone-reputed?_s=PM:CRIME |title=Reputed Capone hideout sold to Wisconsin bank |publisher=CNN |date=8 October 2009 |accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref> As a precaution, he and his entourage would often show up suddenly at one of Chicago's train depots and buy up an entire [[Pullman (car or coach)|Pullman]] [[Sleeping car|sleeper car]] on night trains to places such as Cleveland, Omaha, Kansas City, [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] or Hot Springs, where they would spend a week in luxury hotel suites under assumed names. In 1928, Capone bought a 14-room retreat on [[Palm Island (Miami Beach)|Palm Island, Florida]], close to [[Miami Beach]].<ref name="five families book"/> He never registered any property under his name. He did not even have a bank account but always used Western Union for cash delivery, not more than $1,000.<ref>The Real Story: The Untouchables, [[Smithsonian Channel]] (2009 Documentary) [http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/sc/web/series/679/the-real-story/134028/the-untouchables]</ref>

===Political alliances===
The protagonists of Chicago's politics, and even newspaper circulation 'wars', had long been associated with questionable methods, but the need for bootleggers to have protection in city hall introduced a far more serious level of violence and graft. Capone is generally seen as having had an appreciable effect in bringing about the victories of Republican [[William Hale Thompson]], especially in the 1927 mayoral campaign when Thompson campaigned for a wide open town, at one time hinting that he'd reopen illegal saloons.<ref name="big_bill_232_244">{{cite book|last=Wendt|first=Lloyd|title=Big Bill of Chicago|year=1953|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|pages=232<U+2013>244|author2=Herman Kogan }}</ref> Such a proclamation helped Thompson's campaign gain the support of Capone and Thompson's campaign allegedly accepted a contribution of $250,000 from the gangster.

Capone continued to back Thompson and on the polling day of April 10, 1928 in the so-called [[Pineapple Primary]], voting booths in the wards where Thompson's opponents were thought to have support were targeted by Capone's bomber, [[James Belcastro]], causing the deaths of at least 15 people. Belcastro also was accused of the murder of lawyer Octavius Granady, an African American who dared to challenge Thompson's candidate for the African American vote, and was chased through the streets on polling day by cars of gunmen before being shot dead. Belcastro's co-charged included four policemen; all charges were dropped after key witnesses recanted their statements. An indication of the attitude of local law enforcement to Capone's organization came in 1931 when Belcastro was wounded in a shooting; police suggested to skeptical journalists that Belcastro was an independent operator.<ref>Sifakis, Carl, ''The Mafia Encyclopedia'', 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp.291,292</ref><ref>Russo, Gus, ''The Outfit'', Bloomsbury (2001), pp.38,39</ref><ref>The Evening Independent - Jan 12, 1931, AP, Career of Chicago bomb king halted by bullets</ref><ref>The Afro American - Oct 12, 1929, Chicargo (ANP)Police Named In Granady Killing,</ref><ref>The Outfit: The Role Of Chicago's Underworld In The Shaping Of Modern America

===Saint Valentine's Day Massacre===
{{Main|Saint Valentine's Day Massacre}}
[[File:Valentine Day massacre.jpg|thumb|The St. Valentine's Day Massacre damaged Capone's image in the public mind]]

Capone was widely assumed to have been responsible for ordering the 1929 Saint Valentine's Day Massacre in an attempt to kill the head of the much-attenuated 'North Side' gang, [[Bugs Moran]]. Moran was the last survivor of the main north side gunmen; his succession had come because his similarly aggressive predecessors [[Vincent Drucci]] and [[Hymie Weiss]] had been killed in the violence that followed the murder of original leader, [[Dean O'Banion]].<ref name="five families book"/><ref>http://www.bugsmoran.net/northsiders/drucci.html, Bugs Moran Online, [http://www.bugsmoran.net/northsiders/drucci.html Vincent Drucci], Rose Keefe, accessed 2/7/14</ref><ref>http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id111.htm, ''My Al Capone Museum'' [http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id111.htm "Vincent 'The Schemer' Drucci"], Mario Gomes, accessed 2/7/14</ref>

To monitor their targets' habits and movements, Capone's men rented an apartment across from the trucking warehouse that served as a Moran headquarters. It is reported that on the morning of Thursday February 14, 1929, Capone's lookouts signaled gunmen disguised as police to start a "raid". The ''faux'' police lined the 7 victims along a wall without a struggle then signaled for accomplices with machine guns. The 7 victims were machine-gunned and shot-gunned. Photos of the victims shocked the public and damaged Capone's reputation. Within days Capone received a summon to testify before a Chicago grand jury on violations of federal Prohibition law, but he claimed to be too unwell to attend at that time.<ref>Capone: The Man and the Era, by Laurence Bergreen, p. 418</ref>

In March 27, 1929, as he left a Chicago courtroom after testifying to a grand jury investigating violations of federal prohibition laws, Capone was arrested by FBI agents on charges of having committed contempt of court by feigning illness to avoid an earlier appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/al-capone |title=FBI <U+2014> Al Capone |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-16}}</ref> In May 1929, Capone was sentenced to a prison term in Philadelphia, having been convicted within 16 hours of an arrest for carrying a gun during a trip there. A week after he was released, in March 1930, Capone was listed as the number one 'Public Enemy' on the unofficial [[Chicago Crime Commission]]'s widely publicized list.

In April 1930, Capone was arrested on vagrancy charges when visiting Miami Beach, the governor having ordered sheriffs to run him out of the state.

In court, Judge [[James Herbert Wilkerson]] intervened to reinforce questioning of Capone's doctor by the prosecutor (with whom Wilkerson later went into private practice). Wilkerson sentenced Capone to six months, but while on appeal of the contempt conviction he remained free.<ref>The Pittsburgh Press - Feb 27, 1931</ref><ref>Capone: The Man and the Era, yy Laurence Bergreen p. 419</ref>

Legally, Capone's profits from criminal activity did not have to be entered on a tax return until 1927, when the Supreme court ruled that illegally earned income had to be declared, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. remarking that the previously existing loophole was stretching the Fifth amendment too far.<ref>Capone: The Man and the Era - Page 224</ref>  The IRS special investigation unit chose [[Frank J. Wilson]] to investigate Capone, the focus was on his spending. The key to Capone's conviction on tax charges was proving his income, and the most valuable evidence in that regard originated in his offer to pay tax. Ralph, his brother and a gangster in his own right, was  tried for tax evasion in 1930.  After being convicted in a two week trial over which Wilkerson presided, Ralph spent the next three years in prison.<ref>Al Capone: Chicago's King of Crime, by Nate Hendley, p. 108</ref> Capone ordered his lawyer to regularize his tax position. Crucially, during the ultimately abortive negotiations that followed, his lawyer stated the income Capone was willing to pay tax on for various years, for instance admitting income of $100,000 for 1928 and 1929. Hence without any investigation the government had been given a letter from a lawyer acting for Capone conceding his large taxable income for certain years. In 1931, Capone was indicted for [[income tax evasion]], as well as and various violations of the [[Volstead Act]] (Prohibition) at the [[Chicago Federal Building]] in the courtroom of Judge [[James Herbert Wilkerson]].<ref name="court">{{cite web| title= Visitors to the Court-Historic Trials| publisher=US District Court-Northern District of Illinois| date=| accessdate=2011-02-10|url=http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/CourtHouseVisitors.aspx}}</ref> U. S. Attorney George E. Q. Johnson  agreed to a deal that that he hoped might result in the judge giving Capone a couple of years, but Judge Wilkerson (who had been aware of the deal all along) refused to allow Capone to plead guilty for a reduced sentence.  On the second day of the trial, Judge Wilkerson overruled objections that a lawyer could not confess for his client. Saying anyone making a statement to the government did so at his own risk, Wilkerson deemed the 1930 letter to federal authorities from a lawyer acting for Capone could be admitted into evidence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id146.htm |title=Al Capone's tax trial and downfall |publisher=Myalcaponemuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/capone/caponeaccount.html |title=Al Capone Trial (1931): An Account by Douglas O.

Much was later made of other evidence such as witnesses and ledgers, but these strongly implied rather than stated Capone's control. The ledgers were inadmissible on statute of limitations grounds, but Capone's lawyers incompetently failed to make the necessary timely objection; they also ran a basically irrelevant defense of gambling losses.<ref>Al Capone: A Biography
 By Luciano J. Iorizzo p81</ref>  Judge Wilkerson allowed Capone's spending to be presented at very great length. Although there was no doubt that Capone ''spent'' vast sums, legally speaking the case against him centered on the size of his ''income.'' Capone was convicted and in November 1931, was sentenced to eleven years in federal prison, fined $50,000 plus $7,692 for court costs, and  in addition was held liable for $215,000 plus interest due on his back taxes. The contempt of court sentence was served concurrently.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/capone/caponeverdict.html | title= Selected Documents: Jury Verdict Form (October 17, 1931) | work=Al Capone Trial | first=Douglas O. | last=Linder | publisher=University of Missouri<U+2013>Kansas City | accessdate=2011-10-16}}</ref><ref>Bergreen, p. 484</ref><ref>''Capone v.

They  filed a writ of habeas corpus based on a Supreme court ruling that tax evasion was not fraud, which  apparently meant Capone had been convicted on charges relating to years that were actually outside the time limit for prosecution. However, a judge creatively interpreted the law so that the time Capone had spent in Miami was subtracted from the age of the offences, thereby denying the appeal of both Capone's conviction and sentence.<ref>''Capone v.

===Imprisonment===
[[File:San Francisco-Alcatraz-Al Capones Cell 181.jpg|thumb|Cell 181 in [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|Alcatraz]] where Capone was imprisoned]]
In May 1932, aged 33, Capone was sent to [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta|Atlanta U.S. Penitentiary]]. Upon his arrival at Atlanta, the 250&nbsp;lb Capone was officially diagnosed with [[syphilis]] and gonorrhea. He was also suffering from withdrawal symptoms from cocaine addiction, use of which had perforated his septum. Capone was competent at his prison job of stitching soles on shoes for eight hours a day, but his letters were barely coherent.<ref name="bergreen 511">Bergreen, pp. 511-514</ref> He was seen as a weak personality and so out of his depth dealing with bullying fellow inmates that his cellmate, seasoned convict Red Rudinsky, feared Capone would have a breakdown. Rudinsky, formerly a small time criminal associated with the Capone gang, found himself becoming a protector for Capone.<ref name="bergreen 511"/> The conspicuous protection of Rudinsky and other friendly prisoners, as well as accusations from less friendly inmates, fueled suspicion that Capone was receiving special treatment in Atlanta. While no solid evidence ever emerged, it formed part of the rationale for moving Capone to the recently opened [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]]<ref name="bergreen 511"/><ref>Bergreen, pp. 519-521</ref>

At Alcatraz, Capone's decline became increasingly evident as [[neurosyphilis]] progressively eroded his mental faculties.<ref name="five families book"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timelines.com/1934/8/11/first-prisoners-arrive-at-alcatraz-prison-likely-including-al-capone |title=First Prisoners Arrive at Alcatraz Prison (Likely Including Al Capone) |publisher=Timelines.com |date=1934-08-11 |accessdate=2011-01-27}}</ref><ref>Sifakis, Carl.

==Later years and death==
[[File:Death certificate of Al Capone.jpg|thumb|Capone's [[death certificate]]]]
After Capone was released from prison, he was referred to [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in [[Baltimore]] for the treatment of [[General paresis of the insane|paresis]] (caused by late-stage syphilis). Hopkins refused to admit him solely based on his reputation, but [[Union Memorial Hospital]] took him in. Grateful for the compassionate care he received, Capone donated two Japanese weeping cherry trees to Union Memorial Hospital in 1939. After a few weeks inpatient and a few weeks outpatient, a very sickly Capone left Baltimore on March 20, 1940 for [[Palm Island, Florida]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-08-30/news/1994242174_1_capone-katz-pimlico|last=Sandler|first=Gilbert|title=Al Capone's hide-out|publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=30 August 1994|accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/explore/baltimorecounty/news/ph-ms-union-memorial-0329-20120326,0,1307075.story|last=Perl|first=Larry|title=For Union Memorial, Al Capone's tree keeps on giving|publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=26 March 2012|accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc2news.com/news/region/baltimore-city/medstar-union-memorial-celebrates-capone-cherry-tree-blooming|last=Slade|first=Fred|title=Medstar Union Memorial celebrates Capone Cherry Tree blooming|publisher=[[WMAR-TV|Abc2News]] |date=10 April 2014|accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref>

==Chicago aftermath==
Although the main effect of Capone's conviction was that he ceased to be boss immediately on his imprisonment, those involved in the jailing of Capone portrayed it as having dealt a fatal blow to the city's [[organized crime]] syndicate. Far from being smashed, the [[Chicago Outfit]] continued, without being troubled by the Chicago police. Once [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] was repealed, organized crime in the city <U+2014> already wary of attention after seeing Capone's notoriety bring him down <U+2014> had a concomitantly lower profile, to the extent that there is a lack of consensus among writers about who was actually in control and who was a figurehead 'front boss'.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/> Prostitution, labor union racketeering and gambling became moneymakers for organized crime in the city without incurring serious investigation. In the late 50's, FBI agents discovered an organization led by Capone's former lieutenants reigning supreme over the Chicago underworld.<ref>''The Chicago Outfit'', John J. Binder, chapter four</ref>

==In popular culture==
One of the most notorious American gangsters of the 20th century, Capone has been the subject of numerous articles, books, and films. Capone's personality and character have been used in fiction as a model for crime lords and criminal [[Mastermind (Role Variant)|masterminds]] ever since his death. The stereotypical image of a mobster wearing a blue pinstriped suit and tilted [[fedora]] is based on photos of Capone. His accent, mannerisms, facial construction, physical stature, and  [[parody|parodies]] of his name have been used for numerous gangsters in comics, movies, music, and literature.

===Literature===
*Capone is featured in a segment of [[Mario Puzo]]'s ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'' as an ally of a New York mob boss in which he sends, at the mob boss' request, two "button men" to kill [[Don Vito Corleone]]; arriving in New York, the two men are intercepted by and brutally killed by [[Luca Brasi]], after which Don Corleone sends a message to Capone warning him to not interfere again and Capone apparently capitulates.<ref>{{cite book |last=Puzo |first=Mario |authorlink=Mario Puzo |year=1969 |title=[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]] |isbn=0-7493-2468-6 |pages=214<U+2013>217}}</ref>
