'''Bianca Butcher''' (n<U+00E9>e '''Branning'''; previously '''Jackson''') is a fictional character from the [[BBC]] soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Patsy Palmer]]. The character was introduced by executive producer [[Leonard Lewis]] and appeared initially from 1993 to 1999, when Palmer opted to leave. In 2002 executive producer [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]] brought the character back for a special spin-off show. She returned to ''EastEnders'' as a full time character in April 2008, reintroduced by executive producer [[Diederick Santer]].<ref name="BBCreturn">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7066949.stm |title=Palmer making EastEnders comeback|date=29 October 2007|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=29 October 2007}}</ref> Palmer took maternity leave in 2010, and Bianca was temporarily written out on 21 January 2011.

During her first run on the show during the 1990s, she was known for her bizarre sense of style, her sharp tongue and fiery temper and for screaming "Rickaaaaaaay!"<ref>"{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7068667.stm|title=Owen to join Palmer in EastEnders|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=30 October 2007|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> at her husband. Bianca has been featured in storylines including affairs, feuds, bereavements, family problems, spina bifida and abortion, a problematic marriage to [[Ricky Butcher]] and the revelation of her 15-year-old adoptive daughter [[Whitney Dean]] being sexually abused by her fianc<U+00E9> [[Tony King]] and his subsequent arrest for paedophilia.

== Creation ==
=== Background ===
In his book ''EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration'', ''EastEnders'' scriptwriter [[Colin Brake]] describes 1994 as a "historic" year for ''EastEnders'', as in April, a third weekly episode was introduced.<ref name="first10years">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}</ref> Due to the programme's increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994.<ref name="first10years"/> Among them were the Jackson family, created by [[Tony McHale]]:<ref name="All of Me" /> mother [[Carol Jackson|Carol]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]), her four children, Bianca (Patsy Palmer), [[Robbie Jackson|Robbie]] ([[Dean Gaffney]]), [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), and [[Billie Jackson|Billie]] ([[Devon Anderson]]), as well as Carol's partner [[Alan Jackson (EastEnders)|Alan Jackson]] ([[Howard Antony]]). Though Carol and Alan were not initially married in the serial, and though Alan was only the biological father of Billie, the whole family took on Alan's surname. It later transpired that [[David Wicks]] was Bianca's father.

Various members of the family began to appear sporadically from November 1993 onwards, but in episodes that aired early in 1994, the Jacksons moved from Walford Towers, a block of flats, to the soap's focal setting of [[Albert Square]]. Their slow introduction was a deliberate attempt by the programme makers to introduce the whole family over a long period.<ref name="first10years"/> The Jacksons have been described by Brake as a "classic problem family".<ref name="first10years"/>

===Casting===

Hester Lacey of ''[[The Independent]]'' has described Palmer's casting as an "accident", as she did not formally audition for the role.<ref name="Hester Lacey" /> ''EastEnders'' casting director Jane Deitch and writer<U+2013>director McHale visited her drama class at the [[Anna Scher Theatre]] looking for a girl aged 16 or under. Palmer was not on the list of people they wanted to see as she was older, but she caught the attention of Deitch when she was messing around and giggling with friends. At the end of the class, Palmer was asked by McHale to do something so Anna Scher asked her to improvise a monologue based on the line "I can't believe you just said that." The next day Scher contacted Palmer to say she had been offered an audition. When she arrived at the audition, McHale told producers Palmer was 16 as she would have been refused the part. She was offered a three-month contract the same day.<ref name="All of Me">{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Patsy|authorlink=Patsy Palmer|title=All of Me|accessdate=31 January 2011|date=5 April 2007|publisher=[[Hodder & Stoughton]]|isbn=9780340924112|pages=154<U+2013>157|chapter=Charley <U+2013> and EastEnders}}</ref> In 1996, Palmer commented to Lacey: "I've been a lucky girl.

===Personality===
Bianca has been classified by Rupert Smith, author of ''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square'', as a drama queen, a "strong passionate [woman]" and "Walford's trouble-maker-in-chief".<ref name="20years">{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square]] |year=2005|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|isbn=0-563-52165-1}}</ref> She has also been described by [[Reuters]] as "feisty" and someone "who never minced her words".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL2931447120071029|title= Feisty Bianca to return to EastEnders|publisher=[[Reuters]] | date = 29 October 2007| accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> In 1996, Palmer described Bianca as someone who deserves "a good slap". She added, "I probably wouldn't like Bianca if I knew her in real-life. But I do love playing the character. She is so cheeky and gets to say outrageous things".<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-61335196.html|title= I'd give silly cow Bianca a good slap|first=Chris|last=Hughes|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]] | date = 13 February 1996| accessdate=16 March 2008}}</ref>

He added, "Bianca could sulk for Britain <U+2013> and we adored her for it." However, Rampton also noted that underneath Bianca's bravado, the character is capable of showing "the most affecting vulnerability".<ref name="life"/>

==Development==
In her first six years in the soap, Bianca's storylines included affairs, feuds, bereavements, abortion, and a problematic marriage to Ricky Butcher.<ref name="20years"/>

Bianca's relationship with mechanic [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) has been central to her narrative; their affiliation began in 1994. Palmer and Owen already knew each other before working together on the soap, as both attended the Anna Scher theatre school. Owen has said, "We practically grew up together. We'd known each other for years. It was weird when she started on the show and we began playing the 'Ricky & Bianca Get To Know Each Other' bit. I had already spent a lot of time with Patsy. I think we were both seven when we met."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wgazette.com/int-ricky.html|title=Getting Shticky with "Thicky Ricky"|work=Walford Gazette|first=Tim|last=Wilson|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref>

The dynamics of their relationship were clear from the start, with Bianca portrayed as the dominant, bossy and authoritative partner, while Ricky was shown as the hen-pecked,<ref name="reuters">{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUKL3041280320071030 |title=Ricky to rejoin Bianca in EastEnders |publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> dim-witted "loser" or "soft touch", comically under the thumb of his female counterpart.<ref name="20years"/> James Rampton from ''The Independent'' has commented, "to her eternally put-upon husband, Ricky, Bianca was a ferocious reincarnation of [[Henry Rider Haggard|H Rider Haggard]]'s 'She Who Must Be Obeyed'."<ref name="life"/> Bianca was notorious for shouting the catchphrase "Rickaaaaaaay!" (a [[cockney]] pronunciation of Ricky) at her lover, and Palmer admitted in 2008 that "not a day has gone by in nine years when someone hasn't shouted that from cars and even up at my bedroom window at night."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2008/03/07/ex-eastender-patsy-palmer-still-has-rickaay-shouted-at-her-115875-20342794/|title=Palmer admits she's tired of Ricky cry|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|first=Mark|last=Jefferies|date=7 March 2008|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> Rampton has suggested that Bianca's catchphrase <U+2013> "Rickaaaaaaay!" <U+2013> transitioned, becoming "shorthand for any sort of heinous henpecking."<ref name="life"/> On ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' on 18 April 2008, Palmer explained that it was actually [[Jonathan Ross|Ross]], as a DJ, who had originally inspired the catchphrase.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Friday Night with Jonathan Ross|series= Friday Night with Jonathan Ross|serieslink=Friday Night with Jonathan Ross |credits= Including [[Jonathan Ross]], [[Patsy Palmer]]|network=[[BBC]] |station= [[BBC One]] |airdate=18 April 2008}}</ref>
[[Image:B r wedding.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The wedding of Ricky and Bianca was watched by 22&nbsp;million viewers in April 1997.]]
One of the first notable storylines featuring the couple occurred in 1995, when Ricky embarked on an affair with Bianca's "put-upon sidekick", [[Natalie Evans|Natalie Price]] ([[Lucy Speed]]).<ref name="wg">{{cite news|url= http://www.wgazette.com/spr03-lucyspeed.html |title= The Return of 'Natalie' |work=Walford Gazette|first=Tim|last=Wilson |accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> On-screen Natalie and Ricky found themselves sidelined and bullied by Bianca, forcing them together and leading to their eventual affair, which continued for several weeks on-screen, with Ricky seeing both Natalie and Bianca. The storyline reached its climax on 21 February 1995; 17.0&nbsp;million viewers tuned in to witness Bianca discovering that her boyfriend was sleeping with her best friend.<ref name="episode1995">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic19950221.shtml |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060928233024/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic19950221.shtml|archivedate=28 September 2006|title=Ricky's affair with Natalie|work=[[BBC Online]]|publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> The characters separated but reconciled later in the year when Ricky supported Bianca through a personal crisis <U+2013> the revelation that she had unknowingly tried to seduce her estranged father [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French (actor)|Michael French]]).

Various crises between the characters were featured over the following years, causing them to break up and reconcile numerous times. In the book ''Seeing Things: Television in the Age of Uncertainty'', author John Ellis uses the couple's combustible relationship as an example of emotional intensity and pathos: "A couple like Ricky and Bianca [...] can have constantly sniped at each other for several episodes, for no apparent dramatic purpose except that it is the nature of their relationship. Then they will suddenly be confronted by a life-changing decision [...] There is suddenly a shift in emotional intensity for the audience. Every word now counts, and all the previous audience attitudes of irritation or even condescension to this 'not very bright couple' [...] become a feeling of utter absorption in their dilemma."<ref>{{cite book |author=John Ellis|title=Seeing Things: Television in the Age of Uncertainty|url=http://books.google.com/?id=hX_ztCVi5fkC&pg=PA83&dq=eastenders+bianca|year=2000|publisher=I B Tauris & Co Ltd|isbn=9781860644894}}</ref> The BBC has reported that Bianca and Ricky's on-off romance "captivated millions of fans", and in April 1997 attracted "one of the biggest soap audiences ever", with 22&nbsp;million viewers tuning in to see them marry.<ref name="quitting">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/219572.stm |title=Entertainment Patsy Palmer to leave EastEnders |work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]] | date = 22 November 1998|accessdate=17 March 2008}}</ref> In 2000, Owen stated that the storyline he most enjoyed in ''EastEnders'' was the build up and marriage to Bianca, because "the public's enthusiasm for the event was a great motivation".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/800533.stm|title=What Ricky done next|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date= 23 June 2000|accessdate=17 March 2008}}</ref> In 2008, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' branded Ricky and Bianca "''EastEnders''' most popular couple".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-512908/Together-Ricky-Bianca-return-EastEnders.html|title=Together again: Ricky and Bianca return to EastEnders|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]] | date = 8 February 2008|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref>

===Spina bifida===
In 1997, the character was featured in a storyline about [[hydrocephalus]] ("water on the brain") and [[spina bifida]], a developmental [[birth defect]] resulting in an incompletely formed spinal cord of the baby.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61066602.html|title=Anguish of spina bifida parents|work=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=29 November 1997|accessdate=15 June 2010|last=Raymond|first=Clare|last2=Grant|first2=Clare}}</ref> After becoming pregnant with Ricky's baby, a pre-natal scan revealed that her unborn foetus had the conditions. In the storyline, Bianca agonised about whether or not to have an [[abortion]], but eventually decided to terminate her pregnancy at 20 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2007/nov/01/familyandrelationships.women |title=The untold stories|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|first=Karen|last=Dugdale|date=1 November 2007|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> In scenes shown after the abortion, Bianca and Ricky were given the chance to see and hold their dead daughter, named Natasha, after the birth (Ricky was unable to do this, though Bianca later said her baby had been "perfect"), and a period of heavy grief followed as the characters came to terms with what they had done. The Peterborough-based [[ASBAH|Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus (ASBAH)]] helped and provided information to the programme makers during the storyline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7912/is_2006_April_6/ai_n34454012/|title=Health: Will flour power help stop birth defects in future? |work=[[Peterborough Evening Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Johnston Press|East Midlands Newspapers]]|first=Rachel|last=Wareing | date = 6 April 2006|accessdate=15 June 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Bianca's decision to abort reportedly angered a proportion of viewers, including parents with handicapped children, who rang the BBC to complain that they showed the abortion of a disabled baby.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60994504.html|title=EastEnders Have Lost Plot Say Fans; Anger at baby abortion story|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|first=Tom|last=Little|location=Glasgow, Scotland | date = 27 November 1997|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> However, many were "moved" by the storyline,<ref name="life"/> and Patsy Palmer received critical acclaim for her acting throughout.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20010722/ai_n14535288|title=Child abuse shock for Albert Sq; Exclusive: Star's harrowing role|work=[[Sunday Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|first=Rick|last=Hewett | date = 22 July 2001|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> Palmer was nominated in the 'Best Actress' category at the [[Royal Television Society|Royal Television Society Awards]] <U+2013> the first soap actress to ever be nominated.<ref name="life"/>

The storyline was later used to spread a public message. When Bianca became pregnant once again in 1998, the scriptwriters included scenes of a practitioner advising the character to take [[folic acid]], which protects against spina bifida.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/1999/mar/30/healthandwellbeing.health|title=Not long for the real world|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|first=Luisa |last=Dillner | date = 20 March 1999|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> The ASBAH issued a public plea to ''EastEnders'', urging them to allow Bianca's second baby to be born with spina bifida, in order to show parents that having a baby with spina bifida is "not the end of the world".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60746923.html|title=Let Bianca baby have spina bifida, EastEnders urged|work=[[Sunday Mercury]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=27 September 1998|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> This did not occur, however, and Bianca was shown to give birth to a premature but healthy baby, [[Liam Butcher|Liam]], in an episode that aired on Christmas Day 1998.

===Exit: 1999===
The character was featured in various other storylines, including a feud with [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]); a tug-of-love for Ricky's affections with his first wife [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]); a one-night-stand with [[Lenny Wallace]] ([[Des Coleman]]), causing a [[sexually transmitted disease]] scare; and the death of her best friend [[Tiffany Mitchell]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]). In November 1998, the BBC announced that Patsy Palmer had decided to leave ''EastEnders'' to spend more time with her family.<ref name="quitting"/> The BBC said that Bianca would not be killed off, and a spokesman commented: "Bianca has always been an amazingly powerful character and the door is open to her if she wants to return in the future. She has been fantastic in the years she has been in EastEnders and we will miss her."<ref name="quitting"/> Palmer was one of several high-profile ''EastEnders'' stars to announce their departures that year; McCutcheon and Kemp also decided to leave, and [[Gillian Taylforth]] left the serial in 1998 after 13 years playing [[Kathy Mitchell]]. The BBC said, "no-one is bigger than the show, which is doing extremely well at the moment. We will send her off with all our very best wishes."<ref name="quitting"/> Richard Stokes, ''EastEnders''' series editor and producer of Palmer's exit storyline commented, "you don't expect people to stay here for ever. But it's a double-edged sword. Yes, it's a shame when a well-loved character announces they're going, but the flipside is that it provides us with the space to do the best possible story. If someone is going, you can up the stakes. The whole of Bianca's story was developed once we knew she was going to go."<ref name="bravura">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/sep/12/kathrynflett.theobserver |title=There's only one star here, darlin' and it's Albert Square'|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=12 September 1999|accessdate=16 March 2008|first=Kathryn|last=Flett}}</ref>

Bianca's exit storyline centred upon an extramarital affair with her mother's boyfriend [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]). Lindsey Coulson, who played Bianca's mother Carol, returned to the serial especially to facilitate Palmer's exit.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20010304/ai_n14522695|title=Who Needs Marriage?|work=[[Sunday Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|first=Anne|last= Leask|date=4 March 2001|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> Carol had last been seen on-screen in 1997. When the affair was uncovered, Bianca was disowned by Carol, and her marriage to Ricky ended after Carol forced her to confess the affair to him too. Bianca's exit week was spread out over five episodes, beginning with an hour long special on Sunday 5 September 1999 (at the time the typical weekly broadcast was 3 episodes a week). [[Mal Young]], BBC's Controller of Continuing Drama Series, described the revelatory hour-long Bianca special as a ''[[Play For Today]]'', and Kathryn Flett of ''The Guardian'' described the week's episodes as a "bravura, edge-of-the-sofa, five-night performance".<ref name="bravura"/> Commenting on her exit in 1999, Palmer said, "It was really sad. We were all crying our eyes out <U+2013> the crew as well as the cast. The tears you see on screen are real."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19990905/ai_n14493786|title=A Hard-Hitting End for EastEnders Bianca|work=[[Sunday Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=5 September 1999|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref>

Nicola Methven of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' has described the discovery of Bianca's affair as "one of the truly great emotion-charged scenes in soap history".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2007/10/29/oi-rickaaaaay-biancaaa-s-back-115875-20024175/3/|title=Enders: Bianca's back |work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|first=Nicola|last=Methven |date=29 October 2007|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> Bianca left Walford on a train for Manchester with her son Liam, in an episode that aired in September 1999. In 2005, Bianca's exit storyline was voted as one of "Top 20 greatest soap moments of all time". Chosen by thousands of TV viewers, the televised countdown was presented by [[Dale Winton]] and aired on [[ITV]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-77545089.html|title= Which is soap's greatest scene?|work=[[The People]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|first=Rachel |last=Bletchily|date=26 August 2001|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref>

===Spin-off: 2002===
In 2001, the BBC announced that Patsy Palmer and Sid Owen would reprise their roles as Bianca and Ricky, for a special spin-off, entitled ''[[List of EastEnders television spin-offs#Ricky & Bianca|EastEnders: Ricky & Bianca]]''. Filmed in Manchester in January 2002, the two part, hour long special reunited the characters for the first time in over two years.<ref name="spin" >{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1785761.stm| title= Ricky and Bianca film soap return | work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date =27 January 2002 | accessdate=17 April 2007}}</ref> The spin-off or "soap bubble" was part of plans by [[Mal Young]], the BBC controller of drama serials, to expand the ''EastEnders'' brand.

In the spin-off, Bianca had fallen upon hard times, and accidentally got a visiting Ricky embroiled in a drugs heist. Despite talk of reconciling, Bianca opted to leave Ricky behind once again, leaving Liam in his care. The spin-off brought in various characters unrelated to the main serial, including Vince, Bianca's drug dealing boss played by [[Craig Charles]], and Ricky's fianc<U+00E9>e Cassie, played by [[Sally Ann Triplett]]. Both Ricky and Liam returned to the main serial as regular characters later that year, without Bianca. In an interview, Palmer discussed the spin-off and the reasons why she did not want to return to ''EastEnders'': "I have absolutely no desire to return to ''EastEnders''. Not at all. In fact, I think that brief spin-off of a storyline for Ricky and Bianca was a double-edged sword. On one hand, I don't think we should ever have done it, it was a mistake on my behalf. But on the other, it convinced me that Bianca was someone that I did not want to see again. She was past history as far as I was concerned, I certainly learned that. Don't get me wrong, I had the time of my life when I was in ''EastEnders'' in the middle and late nineties and I worked with some terrific people both in front of and behind the camera. But that was then and this is now <U+2013> the cast has nearly all changed and going back would be worse than foolish."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/7657 |title=Square tactics <U+2013> Patsy Palmer |first=Liz |last=Thomas |work=[[The Stage]] |date=5 May 2005 |accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> In August 2005, Palmer reiterated that she had no desire to return to ''EastEnders'' and branded the show "rubbish".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a23167/no-enders-return-for-patsy.html|title=No 'Enders return for Patsy|first=Kris|last=Green|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=4 August 2005|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref>

Despite Palmer's earlier reservations, it was announced on 29 October 2007 that she would be reprising the role of Bianca.<ref name="BBCreturn"/> ''EastEnders'' executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] said he was "delighted" that Bianca was returning, commenting: "Millions grew up with her and, like the audience, I can't wait to see her back in the show.

On 30 October 2007, a day after the announcement of Bianca's return, it was announced that Sid Owen would also be returning to the show as Ricky.

On 18 March 2008, Mark Jefferies of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' announced that Bianca would return with four children: [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), the fifteen-year-old daughter of Bianca's deceased partner Nathan; [[Liam Butcher]] ([[James Forde]]), Bianca and Ricky's son who previously appeared in the serial; [[Tiffany Dean]] ([[Maisie Smith]]), Bianca's five-year-old daughter with Nathan; and [[Morgan Jackson-King]] ([[Devon Higgs]]), Bianca's three-year-old son who "gets spoilt the most out of all of the kids".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/latest/2008/03/18/bianca-jackson-and-her-four-kids-move-back-to-eastenders-115875-20354690/|title=Bianca Jackson and her four kids move back to EastEnders|last=Jefferies|first=Mark|date=18 March 2008|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref>

To promote the characters' return, the BBC began airing trailers across the BBC network in March 2008.

The character returned on-screen on 1 April 2008, but made her first appearance back in the soap's setting of Albert Square the following week, drawing 10.4&nbsp;million viewers and 42.6% of the total TV viewing audience.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a93390/biancas-square-return-draws-104m.html|title=Bianca's Square return draws 10.4m|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Dave|last=West|date=9 April 2008|accessdate=9 April 2008}}</ref> In the storyline, Bianca had fallen on hard times, and after being evicted from her flat her children were taken into custody, so Bianca returned to Walford to seek help from her grandmother [[Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]). In the documentary ''EastEnders: Ricky and Bianca'', which aired to celebrate the character's return, the changes in Bianca's character were noted: "The carefree, wild child of yesterday, has been replaced by the wore-torn and downtrodden single mum of four. Bianca has done what she always wanted to avoid, repeating the mistakes that her mother Carol had made." ''EastEnders''' series consultant [[Simon Ashdown]] has commented, "Bianca's still the same Bianca in a way, she still speaks before she thinks, comes out fists flying.

===Relationship with Tony King; paedophilia===
Bianca's most notable initial storyline upon her return was a [[paedophilia]] plot revolving around Bianca's partner [[Tony King]] ([[Chris Coghill]]), and her 15 year old step daughter, Whitney. According to the ''Daily Mail'', the storyline has been dubbed as the "most controversial story-line on the show ever".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1056737/Scores-complaints-EastEnders-shows-scenes-paedophile-grooming-teenager.html|title=Scores of complaints as EastEnders shows scenes of a paedophile grooming a teenager |work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|first=Paul|last=Revoir|date=17 September 2008|accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref> The idea for the storyline was conceptualised by writer [[Simon Ashdown]] and other scriptwriters, when they were brainstorming ideas for Bianca's return to ''EastEnders''. They had seen a documentary about homelessness and had been struck by an image of a woman and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go, a scene that was used to similar effect in Bianca and her family's return episode. They considered the homeless family's predicament and were left pondering "What might happen to them? They would be easy prey... What if a paedophile noticed the child, who might be, say, 12, and pretended to be the woman's saviour? She would be too grateful to notice that this was unusual behaviour, that he seemed to have few friends or family".<ref name="controversial">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/sep/13/eastenders.television|title=Dark days in Albert Square |work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|first=Aida |last=Edemariam|date=13 September 2008|accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref> They pitched the idea to [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]], controller of BBC drama production, who said that "It drew a sharp intake of breath. Most ''EastEnders'' stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for." However, paedophilia as a storyline had been pitched before, but the idea had been vetoed because they could not find the right storyline and characters to proceed and, as the topic was so controversial, producers had been unwilling to take the risk.<ref name="controversial"/> Diederick Santer commented, "We knew that something like 16% of under-16s have been sexually abused at some point, but if you can't find a story, it's an issue that sits there, dead, on the show."<ref name="controversial"/> It has been noted in the media that paedophilia is a subject rarely shown on pre-watershed terrestrial television, and although ''EastEnders'' had broached it in 2001 with [[Kat Slater]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) and her abusive uncle [[Harry Slater|Harry]] ([[Michael Elphick]]), this was scripted to have happened in the past and focused on the effect it had on the victim as an adult.<ref name="controversial"/> 

Yorke was initially unconvinced at the Jackson paedophilia storyline proposal. He  commented to ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2008, "My standpoint has always been that there has to be a good editorial justification. If it's just entertainment, or just sensation, or just the bogeyman in this case, then I don't think that's a good enough reason."<ref name="controversial"/> When asked how she felt about the storyline, Palmer commented: "It would be brilliant if it helped somebody. If one person out there who's been abused saw that [the legal system] go out of their way to make it easier on the victim <U+2013> Whitney's evidence is given by video link <U+2013> it will be worth it."<ref name="whatsontv">{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/interviews/patsy-why-i-prefer-ricky-and-bianca-apart/7637|title=Patsy: Why I prefer Ricky and Bianca apart|work=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=6 December 2009|accessdate=12 December 2009}}</ref>

===Reunion with Ricky Butcher===
In November 2009 it was announced that coinciding with the return of her on-screen family and the 25th anniversary of ''EastEnders'', Bianca and Ricky would remarry in February 2010. Entertainment website [[Digital Spy]] reported that: "Show producers have confirmed that the divorced pair's latest love twist will begin at Christmas when Ricky [...] decides to pop the question to his childhood sweetheart. Their wedding will take place in February to coincide with the Walford soap's 25th anniversary celebrations." A spin-off DVD focusing on preparations for the wedding, ''EastEnders: Last Tango in Walford'', was released in February 2010. It features Tiffany arranging a comeback for Bianca's family, plus archive footage and interviews.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a186515/enders-wedding-plot-for-25th-anniversary.html|title='Enders wedding plot for 25th anniversary|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=12 November 2009|accessdate=14 November 2009}}</ref> Palmer told ''[[What's on TV]]'' magazine: "I prefer it when Ricky and Bianca are not together but it's great too when they are. I'm looking forward to the return of her family. Bianca hasn't spoken to her mum since the whole Dan thing so it'll be good stuff."<ref name="whatsontv"/>

Talking about the 25th anniversary week, Santer explained that he wanted great stories to get people talking, saying "That's [...] why we're doing the soap wedding of the year <U+2013> and perhaps the soap wedding of the decade <U+2013> with Ricky and Bianca. The romance played against the thriller story is a great balance, which I hope the audience will be both gripped by and satisfied with.

===Temporary departure: 2011===
On 1 August 2010, the ''[[News of the World]]'' reported that Palmer was pregnant with her fourth child and that she would take maternity leave from ''EastEnders'' later in the year. It also noted that she was already showing a baby bump.<ref>{{cite|url=http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/showbiz/895205/EastEnders-star-Patsy-Palmer-is-pregnant-with-her-fourth-child.html|title=Patsy's pregnant with baby number 4|work=[[News of the World]]|publisher=[[News International|News Group Newspapers]]|location=London|accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref> To facilitate the departure, Bianca will feature in a major storyline, which executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] said was the only possible reason Bianca would have for leaving her family.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a281826/big-bianca-plot-ahead-for-eastenders.html|title=Big Bianca plot ahead for 'EastEnders'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=13 October 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=13 October 2010|location=London}}</ref> In December 2010, it was announced that [[Natalie Cassidy]] would return as part of Bianca's departure storyline which will start in January 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a293725/sonia-to-make-one-off-enders-return.html|title=Sonia to make one-off 'Enders return|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=17 December 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=17 December 2010|location=London}}</ref> Bianca's departure was broadcast on 21 January 2011.<ref>{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 21/01/2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xxght |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Director: [[Clive Arnold]]; Executive Producer: [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]]; Writer: Daisy Coulam |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |airdate=21 January 2011}}</ref> Palmer gave birth earlier than expected, meaning that she started leave three weeks before she planned to.

She developed a penchant for older men, dating [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]) for a time, without telling him she was underage.

===1993<U+2013>99===
Bianca first appears in November 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters/bianca-jackson.shtml|title=Bianca Jackson played by Patsy Palmer |work=[[BBC Online]]|publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=15 June 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> She initially works at [[Ian Beale]]'s ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) fish and chip shop, before becoming the market assistant of [[Sanjay Kapoor (EastEnders)|Sanjay Kapoor]] ([[Deepak Verma]]). Later on she branches out, running her own clothing stall on Bridge Street market.

Bianca has a short relationship with an older man called [[Richard Cole (EastEnders)|Richard Cole]] ([[Ian Reddington]]) in 1994, and when he breaks up with her, she and her friend Natalie harass him with [[prank call]]s, rearrange the furniture in his flat and steal his credit card. When Richard discovers that they were behind the trouble, Bianca and Natalie blackmail him, telling him that Bianca is fifteen and that they will inform the police that he slept with an underage girl if he does not leave them alone.<ref name="20years"/> Bianca then sets her sights on David Wicks, unaware that he is her father. She and David flirt with each other, until Carol tells David the truth <U+2013> that Bianca is his daughter. After this, David keeps his distance from Bianca, who remains unaware of their biological relationship.<ref name="who"/>

Bianca enters into a relationship with [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]). They move into a bedsit together, however, things do not go smoothly for the couple. Bianca spends a lot of time clubbing with her friend Tiffany, and Ricky starts an affair with Natalie. When Bianca discovers the affair she breaks up with Ricky and drives Natalie out of Walford. When a drunk Bianca is nearly assaulted, David takes care of her, but Bianca tries to kiss him. He is forced to tell that he is her father and she spends several weeks coming to terms with the revelation.<ref name="20years"/>

Ricky and Bianca reunite and get engaged in June 1995, however in July 1996, she sleeps with [[Lenny Wallace]] ([[Des Coleman]]). She soon regrets this when she fears she is pregnant with his child. It is a false alarm, but the shock makes her realise how much Ricky means to her and so in 1997 they marry. Later that year, Bianca becomes pregnant with Ricky's baby, however, a pre-natal scan confirms that the unborn child is affected with spina bifida and hydrocephalus. Distraught, Bianca opts to abort her unborn child, a decision which puts a massive strain on her marriage. More problems arise in 1998, when Bianca's infidelity with Lenny is finally revealed to Ricky following an [[sexually transmitted disease|STD]] scare. Ricky considers ending their marriage, but Bianca convinces him to give her another chance and in 1998 she becomes pregnant a second time. She gives birth to baby [[Liam Butcher|Liam]] on Christmas Day in [[The Queen Vic]], helped by her enemy [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) <U+2013> the volatile husband of her best friend Tiffany. Days later, Tiffany is run over and killed by [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (entertainer)|Mike Reid]]) and Bianca spends the early part of 1999 trying to force Tiffany's mother [[Louise Raymond|Louise]] ([[Carol Harrison]]) to leave Walford, having discovered that she slept with Grant.<ref name="20years"/>

In mid-1999, Bianca's mother, Carol, returns to [[Albert Square]] with her new fianc<U+00E9>e Dan Sullivan unaware of Bianca's past relationship with Dan. Bianca and Dan rekindle their affair behind their partners' backs until Carol discovers she is pregnant with Dan's child. Bianca and Ricky make plans to move away to [[Manchester]] so Bianca can attend fashion college there. After finding an old photo of Bianca and Dan together, Carol demands to know their history. Dan tells Carol that they once had a romance that ended years ago, and swore on the life of his unborn child that it was over. Carol questions an unsuspecting Bianca about this. Unaware that Dan has lied to Carol about the current affair, Bianca confesses. Carol decides she wanted nothing more to do with Bianca, and Bianca leaves for Manchester with Liam in September 1999, after informing Ricky that she no longer loves him.<ref name="20years"/>

===2002<U+2013>07===
In May 2002, Ricky visits Bianca in Manchester to discuss custody of Liam. Bianca has been expelled from her university and is working in a nightclub. Struggling to support her child, Bianca becomes desperate and is caught up in a plan to steal <U+00A3>50,000 from her drug-dealing boss, Vince. Ricky persuades her to return the money, but Vince catches them and forces them to become his drug couriers. However, Vince sets them up, the drug-dealers turn violent, and Bianca and Ricky are only saved when armed police raid the establishment. Ricky and Bianca flee and spend the night in a hotel room, where they sleep together and decide to reunite. Ricky breaks the news to his fianc<U+00E9>e Cassie, but she is unwilling to let him go. She convinces Bianca that a life with Ricky will bore her and pleads with her to let Ricky have custody of Liam. Bianca decides this is the right thing to do. Ricky looks on heartbroken as she hitches a ride in a car and departs for a destination unknown.<ref name="r&b">{{cite episode |title=EastEnders: Ricky & Bianca|series= EastEnders|serieslink=EastEnders |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]]|airdate=13 May 2002}}</ref> 

Off-screen, unbeknown to Ricky, Bianca was pregnant with his child. Bianca started a relationship with trucker Nathan Dean soon after in 2002, who believed Bianca's unborn child was his. Bianca acted as stepmother to Nathan's daughter [[Whitney Dean|Whitney]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) but the family was devastated when Nathan was killed in a traffic accident in December 2002. Bianca took on guardianship of Whitney and gave birth to a daughter [[Tiffany Dean|Tiffany]] in 2003, but she struggled financially. She fell pregnant again in 2004, but did not remain with the father. While pregnant, she started dating [[Tony King]] ([[Chris Coghill]]) who appeared to be a good fatherly figure to her children; however, Bianca was unaware that he was a paedophile. Tony [[Child grooming|groomed]] 12-year old Whitney and they began a sexual relationship. After giving birth to her third child [[Morgan Jackson-King|Morgan]], Bianca was given custody of Liam once again in 2006 when Ricky settled with a woman named Melinda, who did not like children. Tony and Whitney's relationship continued in secret until Tony was imprisoned in 2007 for assaulting a boy who propositioned Whitney.

===2008<U+2014>===
In events shown on-screen in April 2008, Bianca is evicted for non-payment of rent and her children are taken into care. Homeless, Bianca moves in with her grandmother [[Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) in Walford and, with Ricky's help, she gets her children back and finds employment waitressing. She rebuffs Ricky's declaration of love, deciding to stick by her imprisoned lover Tony, who is released in September 2008. Tony resumes his affair with Whitney while an unsuspecting Bianca pesters him to marry her; he eventually relents after winding down his affair with Whitney, whom he is no longer attracted to. Sensing Tony's growing disinterest, Whitney tells a disbelieving Bianca of their relationship. After the ensuing fight, Tony leaves but is apprehended by the police and arrested on suspicion of rape of a minor. In the aftermath, Bianca and Whitney's relationship is tested while they both come to terms with what has happened, but they eventually bond again and Bianca supports Whiney through Tony's trial.

Following a [[Parental testing|DNA test]], Ricky is confirmed as Tiffany's father. Slowly, Bianca starts to realise that she is still in love with Ricky; however her attempt to rekindle their romance is ruined when Ricky announces his engagement to his former wife, [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]). Knowing Sam is evading a police sentence, Bianca reports her whereabouts and Sam is arrested. A rift forms between Bianca and Ricky when the truth is revealed. However, Bianca's discovery that Sam is cheating on Ricky ends the engagement, and Bianca and Ricky subsequently reunite on Christmas Day 2009, when Ricky accepts her marriage proposal.

The couple's second wedding occurs in February 2010. During the ceremony, her mother Carol arrives uninvited and attempts to stop the proceedings. She and Bianca brawl, but they finally manage to settle their differences and begin to rebuild their relationship following the wedding. Liam is refused a place at his first choice of school so Ricky and Bianca attempt to appeal this but are unsuccessful. Bianca decides to homeschool Liam but she ends up arguing with Carol and Liam says he will go to the school he has been assigned. When Pat tells Bianca she is fed up of being treated as a slave, she decides to move out, and Bianca calls her selfish as she has nobody to babysit. Bianca reveals to Whitney and Carol that she and Ricky have not been intimate for two months. Her subsequent attempts to entice Ricky are thwarted. Carol then notices that Bianca has bought new underwear, and Bianca wishes her mother would stay out of her private life, yet Carol moves in with Bianca's family, encroaching on Bianca's privacy further. Bianca starts going out and speaks to someone called Bobby on the phone. Carol suspects Bianca of cheating and announces it to Bianca, Ricky and their children and neighbours by showing Ricky Bianca's new underwear as evidence. Bianca reveals that Bobby is actually Ricky and they are simply role playing to spice up their marriage. She asks Carol to apologise or leave so Carol decides to pack her things, but eventually says sorry for everything.

Bianca learns that Sam is pregnant and Ricky could be the father, but says she would not stop Ricky being a father to his boy after the baby is born. Sam insists that the baby is Ricky's even though she had an affair with Bianca's uncle [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]), and she names the baby [[Richard Mitchell (EastEnders)|Richard]] after Ricky. However, Bianca insists that Ricky and Jack take paternity tests, to which Sam agrees. Sam reveals that the baby is Ricky's, which leaves Bianca upset. She orders Ricky to leave and be with Sam but he insists he wants nothing to do with Sam, though he cannot turn his back on his child. Bianca then realises they have taken Sam's word for it and finds out for herself, revealing that Jack is the father.

On Billie's birthday, Carol arranges a party and Bianca secretly brings him home from Southend-on-Sea where he is partying with friends. Billie gets extremely drunk at the party, and Carol decides not to stop him as he is old enough to make his own choices. The next morning, Bianca tries to wake Billie but discovers he has died. She phones Carol, who comes home. Bianca and the rest of the family then watch as doctors, paramedics, police and undertakers arrive and Billie's body is taken away. Bianca is forced to tell Alan his son has died, as Carol refuses to speak to him. Bianca overhears Liam saying that [[Kim Fox]] ([[Tameka Empson]]) kissed Ricky at Billie's party and takes it out on both Ricky and Kim, but Whitney makes her realise that she's not really angry, but just missing Billie. Kim and Bianca then become friends. Bianca then discovers that Carol has hit Liam and when an argument breaks out, Carol blames Bianca for Billie's death and bans everyone from attending his funeral. Carol does not attend the wake and Bianca sees Billie's friend [[Connor Stanley]]'s ([[Arinze Kene]]) bicycle outside Carol's house, but inside finds him not there. Bianca then finds a suicide note from Carol. Carol explains that the note means she is moving out and apologises to Bianca. However, she later tells her the truth but says it was just a moment's thought and she will never feel that way again. She then says she is moving in with her colleague [[Glenda Mitchell]] ([[Glynis Barber]]).

Bianca and Ricky discover that the company they were saving with for Christmas has gone bust, and tell the children that they cannot have many presents that year. They open their only present before Christmas leaving Bianca annoyed that Christmas will not be fun. At the caf<U+00E9>, Bianca steals money from the till. Tiffany and Liam steal perfume from a stallholder (Christian Jenner) for Bianca's Christmas present, which Bianca decides to return. However, once there, she changes her mind and another buyer tells the stallholder that Bianca has taken some perfume. Two police officers, one of them [[List of EastEnders characters (2006)#PC Lance|PC Lance]] (Giles New) go to Bianca's house and search for the stolen perfume. Bianca spots stolen jewellery hidden behind the settee that Whitney is holding for Connor and panics. She accidentally slaps one of the officers and is arrested. The next day she returns home and confronts Whitney about the jewellery. Bianca dumps it into a drain and Whitney explains she was keeping it for Connor, and it belongs to [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). Bianca tells Phil that Connor used Whitney to hide the jewellery, and asks Phil to deal with Connor directly.

When Tiffany starts acting strangely, locking herself in her room and telling people that Carol has died, Bianca suspects she is being abused. However, Carol confesses that she is seeing Connor and that Tiffany saw them together. Whitney is left heartbroken at the revelation, so Bianca attacks Connor, leaving him hospitalised. Bianca eventually decides to hand herself into the police and refuses bail.

===Critical response===
''EastEnders''{{'}} executive producer Diederick Santer has described Bianca as "one of the most popular characters ''[[EastEnders]]'' has ever had",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/bianca-back-in-eastenders_1048205|title= Patsy Palmer <U+2013> Bianca Back in EastEnders|work=[[Contactmusic.com]] | date = 29 October 2007| accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref> while James Rampton, journalist for ''The Independent'', has commented that she is "adored".<ref name="life"/> Palmer has suggested that viewers "rooted" for Bianca because "people love a stroppy girl". In 2000, she commented, "[Bianca] makes them laugh. A character like that is about living out your fantasies. Everybody would love to be like Bianca and really say what they think."<ref name="life"/> Following her exit from the serial in September 1999, Palmer said that members of the public would approach her to plead with her to return to ''EastEnders'', as they missed her character and relationship with Ricky. She commented in 2000, "It makes me feel bad. I sometimes think I should go back [to ''EastEnders''] for everyone else's sake."<ref name="life"/> When the character departed the serial in 1999, Molly Blake of the ''[[Birmingham Post|Birmingham Evening Post]]'' said "Good riddance!" She described Bianca as a "king-sized pain in the backside [...] A screeching and screaming virago with a big mouth and pea-sized brain" and a "prize slapper [who] tormented all those whose paths [she] crossed."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60218751.html|title= Good riddance!; Bianca bows out of Albert Square in EastEnders tonight|work=[[Birmingham Post|Birmingham Evening Post]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]] | date = 10 September 1999| accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref>

In 1995, Chris Barker carried out television research on post-transmission perspectives of [[British Asian]] teenage viewers of ''EastEnders'', using the character Bianca as one of the focus points. He discovered that the participants were both active and implicit in the reproduction of ideology about family relationships and gender. The males regarded Bianca as a "saucy cow", with implications of unacceptable assertiveness in women. They disliked that Ricky was pushed around by Bianca and treated as a subordinate by her friends. The author comments that "such a relationship appears to these boys as the world turned upside down." Girls also viewed Bianca unfavourably in 1995, and the author noted that tensions in "girl-culture" <U+2013> attraction to the traditional private world of interpersonal relationships and the desire to take up more assertive characteristics in public <U+2013> manifested themselves in discussions about Bianca and her friend Natalie Price. Natalie was constructed as a "nice person" in contrast to Bianca, "she can relate to Ricky [...] cares for other people and doesn't just think about herself [like Bianca does]", qualities that were said to be constitutive of the traditional identity of women.<ref>{{cite book |author=Chris Barker|title= Global Television: An Introduction|url=http://books.google.com/?id=jq9OKQj90cAC&pg=PA144&dq=eastenders+bianca+natalie|year=1997|publisher=Oxford: Blackwell |isbn=9780631201502}}</ref>

{{Quote_box |width=35% |align=right|quote="Previous returns have been all about the numbers and not about the story, which is the cardinal sin in this game. While there is, of course, the resultant publicity that comes with any new or returning soap character being announced, the storyline possibilities for Ricky and Bianca arriving back in the Square are good.

This sounds like a soap getting back in touch with its roots".|source=<U+2014>Mark Wright of ''The Stage'' on Ricky and Bianca's 2008 return<ref name="MW"/>}}

In 2008, when it was announced that both Ricky and Bianca were being reintroduced, Santer described them as "a hugely popular and well-loved partnership on the show",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/oct/30/television.bbc|title=Ricky to follow Bianca back to Square|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|first=Leigh|last=Holmwood | date = 30 October 2007| accessdate=16 March 2008}}</ref> and [[Reuters]] branded them two of "the most popular characters on the soap".<ref name="reuters"/> However, Hazel Davis of ''[[The Guardian]]'' was critical about their reintroduction. She commented, "It's a no-brainer on the show's part. Last year, ratings for ''EastEnders'' were at an all-time low. But, just for once, wouldn't it be nice if a soap opera actually introduced new characters with verve and staying power rather than digging up the oldies?"<ref>{{cite news|author=Hazel Davis|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/oct/31/eastendersrickyandbianca|title=Bringing Ricky and Bianca back to EastEnders is the easy option|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=31 October 2007|accessdate=23 January 2008}}</ref> Conversely, Mark Wright from ''[[The Stage]]'' said that the decision to bring these much-loved character back  "is very welcome".<ref name="MW">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2007/10/hello-and-a-sad-goodbye/|title=Hello and a sad goodbye (updated)|last=Wright|first=Mark|date=31 October 2007|work=[[The Stage]]|accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref> Ruth Deller of entertainment website [[Lowculture]] praised Bianca stating: "Bianca and Ricky<U+2019>s return has been one of the best things about [''EastEnders''] in the past year [...] and even when Bianca and co don't have storylines as big as the Whitney/Tony one, they still give good telly."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2009/08/31/soapstar-superstars-august/|title=Soapstar Superstars: August|publisher=[[Lowculture]]|last=Deller|first=Ruth|date=31 August 2009|accessdate=16 May 2010}}</ref>

In March 2010, Bianca was voted the 'Most Popular TV Mum' in an online poll conducted by [[Yahoo!]], gaining 26% of votes. Yahoo!'s TV editor Paul Johnston commented "As loud and garish as Bianca can be, she also has a huge heart when it comes to her children and would do anything to protect them. You certainly wouldn't want her turning up on your doorstep if your kids had been fighting with hers!"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a208345/bianca-butcher-most-popular-tv-mum.html|title=Bianca Butcher 'most popular TV mum'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=12 March 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=4 August 2010|location=London}}</ref>

==In popular culture and other media==
In 1999, [[BBC Books]] published a book about the character, entitled ''Bianca's Secret Diary''. The paperback details the affair between Bianca and her mother Carol's lover, Dan. A BBC source reportedly told the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'': "We've recently dethroned ''[[Coronation Street]]'' at the top of the viewing charts, and this book has the potential to make No.1 in the best-sellers list." It was released on 10 September 1999, just as the TV storyline reached its conclusion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19990829/ai_n14493861|title=EastEnders'Bianca to top book charts|first=Ian|last=Brandes|work=[[Sunday Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=29 August 1999|accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref>

The character was spoofed in the BBC comedy sketch show ''[[The Real McCoy (TV series)|The Real McCoy]]''. One of the show's recurring sketches featured a spoof version of ''EastEnders'', with black comedians taking over roles of well known ''EastEnders'' characters, who frequent a pub called Rub-a-Dub.<ref name="rub">{{cite episode |title=The Real McCoy |series= The Real McCoy|serieslink=The Real McCoy (TV series) |credits= Including Llewella Gideon, [[Meera Syal]], [[Felix Dexter]] |network=[[BBC]] |station= [[BBC2]] |airdate=2 February 1996|season= 6|number=5}}</ref> Actress and comedian [[Judith Jacob]] played the role of Bianca in the sketches. Jacob had previously appeared as a regular character in ''EastEnders'' between 1986 and 1989, as health visitor [[Carmel Jackson]] (unrelated to Bianca's family).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wgazette.com/spr06-carmel.html|title=Judith Jacob Looks Back on Carmel|first=Larry|last=Jaffee|work=Walford Gazette|accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref>
