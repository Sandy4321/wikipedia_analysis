==Early aviation==
In the autumn of 1907, Private First Class Vernon Burge was assigned to [[Fort Myer]], Virginia, to join the newly formed [[Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps]] under Captain [[Charles deForest Chandler]].<ref>Tillman, 2006, pp. 20<U+2013>21.</ref> At that time, the Aeronautical Division was composed of only three officers, ten enlisted men and one female civilian clerk. There was to have been an eleventh enlisted man, but he [[Desertion|deserted]] after learning of his assignment.<ref>Tillman, 2006, p. 217.</ref> At first, the unit trained in the military use of [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloons]].

While Burge was stationed there in August 1908, the [[Wright Brothers]] brought to Fort Myer the first [[fixed-wing aircraft]] bought by the U.S. Army, a [[Wright Model B]] designated "Aeroplane No. 1".<ref name=AFPAM>Chivalette, Master Sergeant William I. [http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFPAM36-2241.pdf "Chapter 2: Enlisted History."] Part of ''Professional Development Guide.'' Air Force Pamphlet AFPAM36-2241, July 1, 2009. Retrieved on November 20, 2009.</ref> Burge worked as a member of the ground crew for the aircraft, and trained in its technology.

On December 16, 1909, Burge transferred to Company H, Signal Corps, traveling in February 1910 to [[Fort Sam Houston]], Texas to serve under Lieutenant [[Benjamin Foulois]] as one of ten enlisted mechanics repairing the frequently damaged Aeroplane No. 1.<ref>Tillman, 2006, p. 82.</ref> Along with Glenn Madole and a civilian mechanic, Burge contrived in August 1910 a way to fasten three wheels to the aircraft so that its skids would not be damaged so much upon landing. Crude as it was, this was the first [[tricycle landing gear]] on an aircraft. Foulois' first reaction was negative: "One of the unpleasant features of landing on wheels is the difficulty experienced in stopping the machine."<ref>Coffman, 2004, p. 165.</ref>

In 1912, the [[United States Army]] sent its seventh aircraft to the Philippines to be used by cavalryman and flier Lieutenant [[Frank Purdy Lahm]], stationed at [[Fort William McKinley]]. As NCO of a two-man detail, Burge accompanied the aircraft to be its [[mechanician]] upon arrival.<ref>Correll, John T. ''Air Force Magazine'', August 2007. [http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Documents/2007/August%202007/0807first.pdf "The First of the Force."] Retrieved on November 20, 2009.</ref> Lahm was to establish a flying school and train two officers. When only one officer came forward for the dangerous duty, Burge volunteered. Lahm took him as a student and taught him to fly the machine, beginning in April. Burge was accepted as a military aviator on June 14, 1912.<ref name=milestones>Air University. [http://afehri.maxwell.af.mil/Pages/milestone.htm Milestones.] Retrieved on November 20, 2009.</ref> On August 14, 1912, Burge received aviator's certificate No. 154 from the ''[[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration A<U+00E9>ronautique Internationale]]'' (FAI) and was promoted to sergeant.<ref name=afmil/> He was rated a master signal electrician.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=6UfmAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PT401&dq=%22Vernon+Lee+Burge%22&lr=#v=onepage&q=%22Vernon%20Lee%20Burge%22&f=false ''The Official Bulletin'', Saturday, July 14, 1917, page 15.] Retrieved on November 20, 2009.</ref>

==Officer==
On June 26, 1917, Burge received a commission as an officer,<ref name=milestones/> with the [[Service number (United States Army)|service number]] O-5511.<ref name=Tillman220/> He joined the [[1st Aero Squadron]] and, as tensions rose in the U.S. near the end of the [[Mexican Revolution]], took part in patrol flights along the [[Mexico <U+2013> United States border]] in 1919. Burge took photographs of the men and aircraft of 1st Aero Squadron.<ref>Photographs of the Vernon L. Burge Collection at the Airmen Memorial Museum, [[Suitland, Maryland]].</ref>

In the spring of 1922, Burge served in [[Oklahoma City]] on an Army Board whose purpose was to investigate the shooting death of Lieutenant Colonel [[Paul W. Beck]]. The board raised serious questions about the actions of Judge Jean P. Day who said he had only intended to strike Beck with his pistol, not shoot him. The board determined that Beck had "died in the line of duty."<ref>Arlington National Cemetery. [http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/pwbeck.htm Paul Ward Beck.] Retrieved on November 20, 2009.</ref>

During the school year 1934<U+2013>1935, Burge attended the [[Air Corps Tactical School]] at the rank of major.<ref name=Finney>Finney, Robert T. (1998) Air Force History and Museums Program.

For two months beginning in June 1939, Burge served in the [[Panama Canal Zone]] as commander of the [[6th Bombardment Group]].<ref>Air Force Historical Research Agency.
