The town of '''Broome, Western Australia was attacked by Japanese fighter planes''' on [[March 3]], [[1942]], during [[World War II]]. At least 88 people were killed. 

Although [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]] was a small [[mother of pearl|pearling]] port at the time, it was also a refuelling point for aircraft, on route between the [[Dutch East Indies|Netherlands East Indies]] and [[List of Australian capital cities|major Australian cities]]. As a result, Broome was on a line of flight for [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and other refugees, following the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Battle of Java (1942)|invasion of Java]], and had become a significant [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] military base. During a two-week period in February<U+2013>March 1942, more than 8,000 refugees from the Dutch East Indies <U+2014> many of them in [[flying boat]]s, which often served as airliners at the time <U+2014> passed through Broome.<ref>[http://www.c7f.navy.mil/news/2002/6/27.htm Lt (j.g.) Paul D. Petsu, 2002, "USS Sides pays tribute to Broome<U+2019>s One Day War" ] (U.S. Seventh Fleet website.) Access date: April 18, 2007. </ref>

==The attack==
[[First Lieutenant|Lt]] [[Zenjiro Miyano]], the commander of ''3 Koku Sentai'' (3rd Air Group) of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]], led nine [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi Zero]]es and a [[Mitsubishi C5M2]] reconnaissance plane from their base at [[Kupang]], [[Timor]] in the attack, on the morning of March 3.

From about 9.20am, the Zeroes made [[strafe|strafing]] attacks on the flying boat anchorage at [[Roebuck Bay]] and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) base at [[Broome International Airport|Broome Airfield]]. No bombs were dropped, although some were reported, perhaps a result of witnesses seeing the Zero pilots releasing their [[drop tank]]s. The raid lasted an hour.

The Japanese fighters destroyed at least 22 Allied aircraft. These included an airborne [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) [[B-24]]A Liberator, full of wounded personnel &mdash; more than 30 died when it crashed in the sea, about 16 km (10 mi) off Broome. The Allies also lost 15 flying boats at anchorage; many Dutch refugees were on board and the exact number and identities of those killed is unknown. At the airfield the Japanese fighters destroyed two [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]]E Flying Fortresses and a B-24 belonging to the USAAF, two [[Lockheed Hudson]]s belonging to the RAAF and a [[Lockheed Lodestar]] belonging to the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Air Force]] (ML-KNIL).

The aircraft destroyed included: eight [[PBY Catalina|Catalinas]] belonging to the [[Dutch Naval Aviation Service|Royal Netherlands Navy Air Service]] (MLD), [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and British [[Royal Air Force]]; two [[Short Empire]]s belonging to the RAAF and [[QANTAS]], and five [[Dornier Do 24]]s belonging to the MLD.

A [[KLM]] [[DC-3]] airliner, [[PK-AFV]], carrying refugees from [[Bandung]], was also shot down, 80 km north of Broome, with the loss of four lives and diamonds worth [[pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]150,000-300,000

There were no Allied [[fighter plane]]s based in Broome at the time. The Zeroes encountered some light arms fire from the ground. One Zero pilot, [[Warrant Officer]] Osamu Kudo, was killed by ground fire from an ML-KNIL pilot, [[First Lieutenant]] Gus Winckel, using a 7.9 mm machine gun he had removed from his Lodestar. Winckel balanced the weapon on his shoulder, and sustained burns to his left forearm, when it touched the barrel of the gun after firing. Another Zero ran out of fuel and ditched while returning to his base, although the pilot survived.

==Aftermath==
Following the attack, an RAAF officer, [[Pilot Officer|P/O]] Frank Russell who had been on one of the flying boats during the raid, wrote of 
{{cquote| ''... a scene of ghastly devastation! Our flying boats all over the place were sending up huge clouds of black smoke.  Burning petrol in sinister patches floated all over the sea... All around us there fell a ceaseless stream of [[Tracer ammunition|tracer bullets]].  Several of the Dutch Dorniers had been full of women and kids, waiting to take off to ... safety." }}

Charlie D'Antoine, an [[indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] flying boat refueller, helped two passengers from the planes to reach the shore, swimming through burning fuel and wreckage.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/message/tv/ms/s1548340.htm ABC-TV, "Broome Hero" (''Message Stick'', February 5, 2006)] Access date: April 18, 2007.</ref> D'Antoine later received a bravery award from the Dutch government and was invited to attend a royal reception in the Netherlands.

At least one U.S. serviceman, Sgt Melvin Donoho, managed to swim about 16 km (10 mi) from the crashed B-24 to shore, a journey which took him more than 36 hours. Some accounts say that a Sgt Willard J. Beatty also made it ashore but died soon afterwards; other sources suggest that this was a false report, emanating from one newspaper article.<ref>[http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/collections/maritime/march/treasures/zerohour/carnotbay.html#liberator Western Australian Museum (no date), "The B24 Liberator crash"] Access date: April 18, 2007. </ref>

Japanese aircraft later made several smaller attacks on the Broome area. On March 20, [[Mitsubishi G4M]] "Betty" heavy bombers made a high altitude attack on the airfield.<ref>[http://www.pacificwrecks.com/provinces/australia_broome.html pacificwrecks.com, 1997-2007, "Broome"] & [http://www.awm.gov.au/alliesinadversity/japanese/broome.asp Australian War Museum, 2006, "The Japanese raid on Broome"] Access date for both references: April 18, 2007 </ref> One civilian was killed and there was some crater damage.
