'''[[Nine Inch Nails]]''', an [[industrial rock]] band [[frontman|fronted]] by [[Trent Reznor]], has performed throughout the world, including tours in North America, South America, Europe, Australia, Japan, and China. While Reznor controls the creative and musical direction of Nine Inch Nails in-studio, the touring band performs different arrangements of the songs in live settings. In addition to regular concerts, the band has performed in both supporting and headlining roles at festivals such as [[Woodstock '94]], [[Lollapalooza]] 1991 and 2008, as well as many other one-off performances including the [[MTV Video Music Awards]].

Reznor writes and performs most Nine Inch Nails studio material with occasional instrumental and vocal contributions from others artists. However, Reznor has typically assembled groups of backing musicians to interpret songs for tours and other live performances. Keyboardist [[Alessandro Cortini]] said that "if you see the show and you're used to the CDs it's pretty clear that the studio entity is different from the live entity".<ref name="Wigney">{{cite web

The only constant member of the live band is Reznor, who cites the long periods of time between major tours as one reason for the ever-changing live lineup.  Live Nine Inch Nails performances are typically accompanied by lighting, stage, and video projection effects. Since 1999, the visual design components of live shows have been created by [[Rob Sheridan]]. Three Nine Inch Nails tours have been featured on live albums and tour documentaries.

Critical and commercial response to Nine Inch Nails live performances has generally been positive. Critics have pointed to the concerts' aggressive on-stage dynamic and visual designs as high points.

===Early tours and Pretty Hate Machine tour (1988&ndash;1991)===

Reznor assembled the first live line-up in 1988 to support the Canadian [[industrial music]] band [[Skinny Puppy]] on tour. The three-piece band consisted of Reznor on guitars and lead vocals, Ron Musarra on drums, and [[Chris Vrenna]] on keyboards. The band was poorly received, however, and they were asked to leave the tour after 10 dates.<ref name="Getting Down in It" /> After the Skinny Puppy tour the band was rearranged and expanded to include a fourth member; Vrenna was moved to drums, Nick Rushe and later David Hymes contributed on keyboards, while [[Richard Patrick]] was added as guitarist.

After the 1994 release of ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'', the live band embarked on the Self-Destruct tour in support of the album.  Vrenna and Woolley returned on drums and keyboards respectively. [[Robin Finck]] replaced Patrick on guitar, while bassist [[Danny Lohner]] was added to the line-up.

The main leg of the tour featured [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] as the supporting act, who Reznor had recently signed to his [[Nothing Records]] label. At the time, Marilyn Manson featured bassist [[Jeordie White]] (then playing under the pseudonym "Twiggy Ramirez"), who would later play bass with Nine Inch Nails from 2005 to 2007.  After another tour leg supporting the remix album ''[[Further Down the Spiral]]'', Nine Inch Nails contributed to the [[Alternative Nation Festival]] in Australia.  Following the three-date alternative music festival, Nine Inch Nails embarked on the [[Outside Tour|Dissonance Tour]], which included 26 separate performances with co-headliner [[David Bowie]].

===Performance 2007===
Having taking a break from touring to complete work on ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'', Nine Inch Nails began a world tour in 2007, including their first ever performance in China.<ref>{{cite web

The ''Year Zero'' project included an [[alternate reality game]] of [[Year Zero (alternate reality game)|the same name]], with much of the game revolving around various live shows.  
During a Nine Inch Nails concert in [[Lisbon|Lisbon, Portugal]], a [[USB flash drive]] was found in a bathroom stall containing a high-quality [[MP3]] of the track "My Violent Heart", a song from the then-unreleased album.<ref name="violentleak">{{cite web

In April 2007, Nine Inch Nails fans received in-game telephone-calls in which they were invited to a "resistance meeting" in Los Angeles.  At the meeting, fans attended a fictional [[Characters and organizations in the Year Zero alternate reality game|Art is Resistance]] meeting, and were later rewarded by an unannounced performance by Nine Inch Nails.  The concert was cut short as the meeting was raided by a fictional [[SWAT]] team and the audience was rushed out of the building.<ref name="secret NIN show">{{cite web

Later that year, the ''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]'' reported that the [[September 18]] show in [[Honolulu]] would be the last performance of the current incarnation of the Nine Inch Nails live band. Reznor told the newspaper "at this point, I want to switch things around a bit.  Nine Inch Nails as a rock band configuration, we've done it and we've done it again.  I see other ways I can present the material in concert, more challenging, something new.  I don't want it to go stale".<ref name="break-up">{{cite web

===Performance 2008===
The seventh and eighth major Nine Inch Nails studio-releases, ''[[Ghosts I<U+2013>IV]]'' and ''[[The Slip (album)|The Slip]]'', were released in March and May 2008 respectively.

Visual elements employed during Nine Inch Nails concerts have often included numerous lighting, stage and projection effects employed to accompany and augment presentation.<ref name="unogateway">{{cite news

Since 1999, the visual presentation of Nine Inch Nails live shows have been directed by [[Rob Sheridan]], while Bill Viola designed a large triptych display for the Fragility tour.<ref name="Gergiev" />  The images displayed on the triptych focused on storm and water imagery.  ''[[And All That Could Have Been]]'' features an audio commentary track by Viola describing the display and his inspirations for it.<ref>{{cite news

For the Live: With Teeth tour, Roy Bennett and Martin Phillips were responsible for the lighting design and stage design respectively.<ref name="WT lighting">{{cite journal
  | title = Production Profile: Nine Inch Nails
  | publisher = ''Projection, Lights and Staging News''
  | first = Steve 
  | last = Jennings 
  | date = [[2005-12-08]]}}</ref>  Bennett explained in a 2005 interview that much of the lighting was done using a series of [[Light-emitting diode|LED lights]] arranged in "stalactites or stalagmites [formations] to tie in to the album artwork".  [[DLP]] projectors were also used to project images onto a gauze screen in front of the stage.  

[[Image:Nine Inch Nails Moline 08.jpg|thumb|right|A Nine Inch Nails performance during the Live: With Teeth tour featuring the "teeth" lighting fixtures]]
Using the gauze projection-screen, Phillip, Reznor, and Sheridan devised a "gag" where they projected "a sheet of glass shattering onto a downstage kabuki scrim that would drop as the glass shatters fell. ... We settled on Trent swinging his guitar at the gauze [and] shattering it, but with all the pieces falling up as the [screen] flew out".<ref name="WT lighting" />  This technique can be seen in the tour documentary ''Beside You in Time''.  In contrast to the lighting of previous tours, Performance 2007 featured minimal lighting that was designed to shadow Reznor and the band.<ref>{{cite news

==Live band members==
The configuration of the band has evolved since first touring in 1988. Early incarnations of the band had three people playing [[guitar]]s, [[drum]]s, [[keyboard]]s, and [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]].  Later incarnations replaced the keyboards and samplers with an additional guitarist, and incarnations after that added a [[bass guitar]]ist. Finally, the live component of Nine Inch Nails has settled as a five-piece band since the ''Self Destruct'' tour from 1994.  In September 2007, Reznor expressed his interest in moving away from the "rock band configuration" to explore "other ways [to] present the material in concert",<ref name="break-up" /> though once again the 2008 incarnation consists of five positions.

Describing the selection process, early contributor [[Chris Vrenna]] told ''[[Gannett News]]'' "coming from the same emotional background, I feel, is more important than how well you can play your instrument. That's one reason that makes our shows more intense when we're up there ... We found people that understood that. It makes us stronger".<ref>{{cite journal

  | date = December 1994
  | title = Nine Inch Nails live <U+2013> Emotions High and Raw
  | accessdate = 2008-05-01}}</ref>  Reznor described his selection of the earliest incarnations of the live band by saying "I'm not in the position to offer somebody a thousand dollars a week to rehearse ... So I took some young guys who were malleable, who would basically do what I want them to do but expand on it.  The only context I've worked with them in so far is, 'Here are the songs, here are your parts, learn them.' "<ref name="Thrasher 1990">{{cite journal

Between major tours, live band members have on occasion contributed instrumental performances to official Nine Inch Nails releases, though creative control and direction has always been the responsibility of Reznor.  Live-band members who have contributed to major Nine Inch Nails studio releases are denoted by a "<U+2020>" below.
