'''[[Eastern Bloc]] information dissemination''' was controlled directly by each country's [[Communist party]], which controlled the state [[Mass media|media]], [[censorship]] and [[propaganda]] organs. State and party ownership of print, television and radio media served as an important manner in which to control information and society in light of Eastern Bloc leaderships viewing even marginal groups of opposition intellectuals as a potential threat to the bases underlying Communist power therein.  

Circumvention of dissemination controls occurred to some degree through [[samizdat]] and limited reception of western radio and television broadcasts. In addition, some regimes heavily restricted the flow of information from their countries to outside of the Eastern Bloc by heavily regulating the travel of foreigners and segregating approved travellers from the domestic population.

==Background==
===Creation of the Eastern Bloc===
{{main|Eastern Bloc}}
[[Image:EasternBlocAfter.png|right|thumb|300px|Map of the [[Eastern Bloc]]]]
[[Bolsheviks]] took power following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. During the [[Russian Civil War]] that followed, coinciding with the [[Red Army]]'s entry into [[Minsk]] in 1919, Belarus was declared the [[Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia]]. After more conflict, the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was declared in 1920. With the defeat of the [[Ukraine]] in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]], after the March 1921 [[Peace of Riga]] following the [[Polish-Soviet War]], central and eastern Ukraine were annexed into the Soviet Union as the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In 1922, the [[Russian SFSR]], [[Ukraine SSR]],  [[Byelorussian SSR]] and [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] were [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|officially merged]] as republics creating the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], or [[Soviet Union]].

At the end of [[World War II]], all eastern and central European capitals were controlled by the Soviet Union.<ref name="wettig69">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=69}}</ref>  During the final stages of the war, the [[Soviet Union]] began the creation of the [[Eastern Bloc]] by directly annexing several countries as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] that were originally effectively ceded to it by Nazi Germany in the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]]. These included eastern [[Poland]] (incorporated into [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|two different SSRs]]),<ref name="stalinswars43">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=43}}</ref> [[Latvia]] (became [[Latvia SSR]]),<ref name="wettig20">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=21}}</ref><ref name="senn">Senn, Alfred Erich, ''Lithuania 1940 : revolution from above'', Amsterdam, New York, Rodopi, 2007 ISBN 9789042022256</ref> [[Estonia]] (became [[Estonian SSR]]),<ref name="wettig20"/><ref name="senn"/> [[Lithuania]] (became [[Lithuania SSR]]),<ref name="wettig20"/><ref name="senn"/> part of eastern [[Finland]] (became [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]])<ref name="ckpipe">Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline, ''Stalin's Cold War'', New York: Manchester University Press, 1995, ISBN 0719042011</ref> and northeastern [[Romania]] (became the [[Moldavian SSR]]).<ref name="stalinswars55">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=55}}</ref><ref name="shirer794">{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=794}}</ref> 

By 1945, these additional annexed countries totaled approximately 180,000 further square miles, or slightly more than the area of West Germany, East Germany and Austria combined.<ref name="graubard150">{{Harvnb|Graubard|1991|p=150}}</ref> Other nations were converted into [[Satellite state|Soviet Satellite]] states, such as the [[People's Republic of Poland]], the [[People's Republic of Hungary]],<ref name="granville">Granville, Johanna, ''The First Domino: International Decision Making during the Hungarian Crisis of 1956'', Texas A&M University Press, 2004.

===Conditions in the Eastern Bloc===
[[Image:Berlin Wall Potsdamer Platz November 1975 looking east.jpg|thumb|right|[[Berlin Wall]] 1975]]
{{see|Eastern Bloc|Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|Eastern Bloc politics|Eastern Bloc economies}}
Throughout the Eastern Bloc, both in the Soviet Socialist Republic and elsewhere, Russia was given prominence, and referred to as the ''naibolee vydaju<U+0161><U+010D>ajasja nacija'' (the most prominent nation) and the   ''rukovodja<U+0161><U+010D>ij narod'' (the leading people).<ref name="graubard150"/> The Soviets encouraged the admiration of everything Russian and the reproduction of their own Communist structural hierarchies in each of the Bloc states.<ref name="graubard150"/> 

The defining characteristic of Communism as implemented in the [[Eastern Bloc]] was the unique symbiosis of the state with society and the economy, resulting in politics and economics losing their distinctive features as autonomous and distinguishable spheres.<ref name="hardt11">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=11}}</ref>  Initially, Stalin directed systems that rejected Western institutional characteristics of [[market economy|market economies]], democratic governance (dubbed "[[bourgeois democracy]]" in Soviet parlance) and the rule of law subduing discretional intervention by the state.<ref name="hardt12">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=12}}</ref>  The Soviets mandated expropriation and ''etatization'' of private property.<ref name="roht83">{{Harvnb|Roht-Arriaza|1995|p=83}}</ref> 

The Soviet-style "replica regimes" that arose in the Bloc not only reproduced Soviet [[command economy|command economies]], but also adopted the methods employed by [[Joseph Stalin]] and Soviet secret police to suppress real and potential opposition.<ref name="roht83"/> Communist regimes in the Eastern Bloc saw even marginal groups of opposition intellectuals as a potential threat because of the basis underlying Communist power.<ref name="Pollackxiv">{{Harvnb|Pollack|Wielgohs|2004|p=xiv}}</ref> The suppression of dissidence and opposition was a central prerequisite for the security of Communist power within the Eastern Bloc, though the degree of opposition and dissident suppression varied by country and period.<ref name="Pollackxiv"/>  

While over 15 million Eastern Bloc residents migrated westward from 1945 to 1949,<ref>{{Harvnb|B<U+00F6>cker|1998|p=207-9}}</ref> emigration was effectively halted in the early 1950s, with the Soviet approach to controlling national movement emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc.<ref name="dowty114">{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=114}}</ref> Furthermore, the Eastern Bloc experienced economic mis-development by central planners resulting in those countries following a path of extensive rather than intensive development, and thus lagging far behind their western European counterparts in per capita Gross Domestic Product.<ref name="hardt15">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=15-17}}</ref>

===Media and information control===
{{see|Deutscher Fernsehfunk|Rundfunk der DDR|Mass media in Communist Czechoslovakia|Soviet Information Bureau}}
In the [[Eastern Bloc]], the state owned and operated the means of mass communication.<ref name="frucht489">{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=489}}</ref>  The ruling authorities viewed media as a propaganda tool, and widely practiced censorship to exercise almost full control over the information dissemination.<ref name="frucht489"/>  The press in Communist countries was an organ of, and completely reliant on, the state.<ref name="oneil15">{{Harvnb|O'Neil|1997|p=15}}</ref>  Until the late 1980s, all Eastern Bloc radio and television organizations were state-owned (and tightly controlled), while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the local Communist party.<ref name="oneil25">{{Harvnb|O'Neil|1997|p=125}}</ref>  

Youth newspapers and magazines were owned by youth organizations affiliated with the communist party.<ref name="oneil25"/>  The governing body in the Soviet Union was "USSR State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting", or USSR Gosteleradio (<U+0413><U+043E><U+0441><U+0443><U+0434><U+0430><U+0440><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+043A><U+043E><U+043C><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435><U+0442> <U+043F><U+043E> <U+0442><U+0435><U+043B><U+0435><U+0432><U+0438><U+0434><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+044E> <U+0438> <U+0440><U+0430><U+0434><U+0438><U+043E><U+0432><U+0435><U+0449><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+044E> <U+0421><U+0421><U+0421><U+0420>, <U+0413><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+0435><U+043B><U+0435><U+0440><U+0430><U+0434><U+0438><U+043E> <U+0421><U+0421><U+0421><U+0420>), which was in charge both of [[Soviet TV]] and [[Radio in the Soviet Union]].

The Communist party exercised control over the media and was responsible for censorship.<ref name="oneil25"/> Media served as an important form of control over information and thus of society.<ref name="oneil1">{{Harvnb|O'Neil|1997|p=1}}</ref>  Eastern Bloc authorities viewed the dissemination and portrayal of knowledge as vital to the survival of Communism and thus stifled alternative concepts and critiques.<ref name="oneil1"/>  Several state Communist Party newspapers were published. Radio was initially the dominant medium, with television being considered low on the priority list when compiling [[Five-Year Plans]] during the [[industrialisation]] of the 1950s.

===Censorship and quashing of dissent===
{{Double image stack|left/right/center|Voroshilov, Molotov, Stalin, with Nikolai Yezhov.jpg|The Commissar Vanishes 2.jpg|180|[[Nikolai Yezhov]], the young man strolling with [[Stalin]] to his right, was shot in 1940.

{{see|Censorship in East Germany|Censorship in the People's Republic of Poland|Censorship in the Soviet Union|   Censorship of images in the Soviet Union|Anti-Soviet agitation}}
Strict censorship existed in the Eastern Bloc, though it was at times circumvented by those engaging in [[samizdat]].<ref name="major6">{{Harvnb|Major|Mitter|2004|p=6}}</ref> Censorship institutions in the countries of the Bloc were organized differently.<ref name="frucht489"/> For example, censorship in [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] was clearly identified whereas it was loosely structured, but no less efficient, in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]].<ref name="frucht489"/> Strict censorship was introduced in the [[People's Republic of Albania]] and [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] as early as 1944, though it was somewhat relaxed in Yugoslavia after the [[Tito-Stalin split]] of 1948.<ref name="frucht127">{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=127}}</ref>  Unlike the rest of the Eastern Bloc, relative freedom existed for three years in [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] until Soviet-style censorship was fully applied in 1948,<ref name="frucht127"/> along with the [[Czechoslovak coup d'<U+00E9>tat of 1948]].

Throughout the Bloc, the various ministries of culture held a tight rein on writers.<ref name="major15">{{Harvnb|Major|Mitter|2004|p=15}}</ref> Cultural products reflected the propaganda needs of the state<ref name="major15"/> and Party-approved censors exercised strict control in the early years.<ref name="crampton247">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=247}}</ref>  During the Stalinist period, even the weather forecasts were changed if they would have otherwise suggested that the sun might not shine on [[May Day]].<ref name="crampton247"/>  Under [[Nicolae Ceau<U+015F>escu]] in [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]], weather reports were doctored so that the temperatures were not seen to rise above or fall below the levels which dictated that work must stop.<ref name="crampton247"/>

In each country, leading bodies of the ruling Communist Part exercised hierarchical control of the censorship system.<ref name="frucht127"/> Each Communist Party maintained a department of its [[Central Committee]] apparatus to supervise media.<ref name="frucht127"/>  Censors employed auxiliary tools such as: the power to launch or close down any newspaper, radio or television station, licensing of journalists through unions and the power of appointment.<ref name="frucht127"/> Party bureaucrats held all leading editorial positions.<ref name="frucht127"/>  One or two representatives of censorship agencies modeled on the Soviet GLAVLIT (Main Administration for the Protection of Official and Military Secrets) worked directly in all editorial offices.<ref name="frucht127"/>  No story could be printed or broadcast without their explicit approval.<ref name="frucht127"/> 

Initially, [[East Germany]] presented unique issues because of rules for the occupying powers in the divided Germany (e.g. regarding media control) that prevented the outright seizure of all media outlets.<ref name="pike219">{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|p=219}}</ref>  The Soviet occupation administration (SVAG) directed propaganda and censorship policies to East German censorship organs through its "sector for propaganda and censorship".<ref name="pike217"/> While the initial SVAG policies did not appear to differ greatly from those in the western occupation zones governing [[denazification]],<ref name="pike220">{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|p=220-1}}</ref> censorship became one of the most overt instruments used to manipulated political, intellectual and cultural developments in East Germany.<ref name="pike217">{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|p=217-8}}</ref> Art societies and associations that had existed prior to World War II were dissolved and all new theatres an art societies had to register with SVAG.<ref name="pike221">{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|p=231-2}}</ref>  Art exhibits were put under a blanket ban unless censorship organs approved them in advance.<ref name="pike221"/>

After East Germany's official establishment, while the original constitution<ref> [http://www.documentarchiv.de/ddr/verfddr1949.html October 7, 1949 Constitution of East Germany], German Document Archive {{de icon}}</ref> provided that "censorship of the media is not to occur", both official and unofficial censorship occurred, although to a lesser extent during its later years. Thereafter, official East German censorship was supervised and carried out by two governmental organizations, the ''Head office for publishing companies and bookselling trade'' (Hauptverwaltung Verlage und Buchhandel, HV), and the ''Bureau for Copyright'' (B<U+00FC>ro f<U+00FC>r Urheberrechte). The HV determined the degree of censorship and the method of publishing and marketing works. The Bureau for Copyright appraised the work, then decided if it or another publication was permitted to be published in East Germany or in foreign country. For theatres, a "repertory commission" was created that consisted of the ''Ministerium f<U+00FC>r Volksbildung'' (MfV), the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] party, the applicable theatre union and the East German office for theatrical affairs.<ref name="pike236">{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|p=236}}</ref> 

No play could be accepted, rehearsed, or performed without prior ministerial approval.<ref name="pike236"/> After a long visa procurement process, western visitors driving over the West German border to East Germany had their car strip-searched for prohibited Western "propaganda material."<ref name="philipsen9">{{Harvnb|Philipsen|1993|p=9}}</ref> Nevertheless the East German authorities found it extremely difficult to prevent their citizens listening to Western radio stations and [[ARD (broadcaster)|Western TV]] was available across most of the GDR. Technical and diplomatic considerations meant attempts at [[Radio jamming|jamming]] Western Stations were (unlike in other Eastern bloc countries) soon abandoned.

In the [[Soviet Union]], in accordance with the official ideology and politics of the [[CPSU|Communist Party]], [[Goskomizdat]] censored all printed matter, [[Goskino]] supervised all [[film|cinema]], [[Gosteleradio]] controlled [[radio]] and [[television]] [[broadcasting]] and the [[First Department]] in many agencies and institutions, such as the State Statistical Committee ([[Goskomstat]]), was responsible for assuring that state secrets and other sensitive information only reached authorized hands. The Soviets destroyed pre-revolutionary and foreign material from libraries, leaving only "special collections" (''[[spetskhran]]''), accessible by special permit from the [[KGB]]. The [[Censorship of images in the Soviet Union|Soviet Union also censored images]], included removing repressed persons from texts, posters, paintings and photographs.

This did not prevent state scrutiny, as with the case of Bogza coming under the scrutiny of the [[Securitate]].<ref>Chiorean, Claudia Tala<U+015F>man, "Promovarea mitului Erei Noi <U+00EE>n perioada 1989<U+2013>2000 prin ''Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>''",, p.138-139</ref>

The major newspapers were traditionally the daily official publications of the Communist Party.<ref name="frucht489"/> Newspapers served as the main party organs of record and provided official political roadmaps for officials and other readers who needed to be informed.<ref name="frucht639">{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=639}}</ref> In some countries, the press provided a significant source of income for the ruling Communist parties.<ref name="frucht639"/> Radio and television was controlled by the state.<ref name="frucht490"/>  The [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS)]] was the central agency for collection and distribution of internal and international news for all Soviet newspapers, radio and television stations. TASS monopolized the supply of political news.<ref name="frucht127"/> It was frequently infiltrated by Soviet intelligence and security agencies, such as the [[NKVD]] and [[GRU]]. TASS had affiliates in 14 Soviet republics, including the [[Lithuanian SSR]], [[Latvian SSR]], [[Estonian SSR]], [[Moldavian SSR]]. [[Ukrainian SSR]] and [[Byelorussian SSR]].

Despite outward similarities in press policy, large differences existed in the roles and functions of the mass media in Eastern Bloc countries.<ref name="frucht640">{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=640}}</ref>  Where the press was allowed more freedom, such as in Poland, Hungary, and Yugoslavia, a national subtext and a significant element of entertainment flourished.<ref name="frucht640"/> In some cases, newspapers and magazines served as the most visible part of liberalizing forces, such as in Poland in 1956 and 1980<U+2013>81, in Hungary in 1956, and in Czechoslovakia in 1968.<ref name="frucht640"/> 

In many instances toward the end of the Eastern Bloc's existence, the ruling Communist parties' messages in the press increasingly diverged from reality, which contributed to the declining faith of the public in Communist rule.<ref name="frucht640"/>  At the same time, some press in the Eastern Bloc became more open in the 1980s in countries such as Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.<ref name="frucht640"/>  In Yugoslavia, the press after Tito's reign turned increasingly nationalistic.<ref name="frucht640"/> Only in Romania and Albania did the press remain under tight dictatorial control right up until the end of the Easter Bloc.<ref name="frucht640"/>

In [[East Germany]], where initial control could be less overt because of shared allied occupation rules, the Soviet SVG set up the Deutsche Verwaltung f<U+00FC>r Volksbildung (DVV) in the fall of 1945.<ref name="pike217"/> The SVAG and DVV controlled and approved all publication licenses needed to publish newspapers, books, journals and other materials.<ref name="pike225">{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|p=225-6}}</ref>  Those agencies also provided the top publishing priorities, and would apportion paper used for printing to the various publications in accordance with those priorities.<ref name="pike225"/> The SVAG initially licensed some private publishers which required the employment of a greater number of censors.<ref name="pike225">{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|p=227-8}}</ref>

==Control of information flow out of the Eastern Bloc==
Beginning in 1935, [[Joseph Stalin]] effectively sealed off outside access to the [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] (and until his death), effectively permitting no foreign travel inside the Soviet Union such that outsiders did not know of the political processes that had taken place therein.<ref name="laqueur22">{{Harvnb|Laqueur|1994|p=22}}</ref> During this period, and even for 25 years after Stalin's death, the few diplomats and foreign correspondents that were permitted inside the Soviet Union were usually restricted to within a few miles of Moscow, their phones were tapped, their residences were restricted to foreigner-only locations and they were constantly followed by Soviet authorities.<ref name="laqueur22"/>  Dissenters who approached such foreigners were arrested.<ref name="laqueur23">{{Harvnb|Laqueur|1994|p=23}}</ref> For many years after World War II, even the best informed foreigners did not know the number of arrest or executed Soviet citizens, or how poorly the Soviet economy had performed.<ref name="laqueur23"/>

Similarly, the regimes in [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]] carefully controlled foreign visitors in order to restrict the flow of information coming out of (and into) Romania.<ref name="deletantix">{{Harvnb|Deletant|1995|p=ix}}</ref>  Accordingly, activities in Romania remained, until the late 1960s, largely unknown to the outside world.<ref name="deletantix"/> As a result, until 1990, very little information regarding labour camps and prisons in Romania appeared in the West.<ref name="deletantix"/> When such information appeared, it was usually in Romanian <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9> publications.<ref name="deletantix"/> Romania's [[Securitate]] secret police were able to suppress information leaking to the west about resistance to the regime.<ref name="deletantxiv">{{Harvnb|Deletant|1995|p=xiv}}</ref>  Stalinist [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]], which had become increasingly paranoid and isolated after [[de-Stalinization]] and the death of [[Mao Tse Tung]],<ref name="olsen19">{{Harvnb|Olsen|2000|p=19}}</ref> restricted visitors to 6,000 per year, and segregated those few that traveled to Albania.<ref name="turnock48">{{Harvnb|Turnock|1997|p=48}}</ref>

==Propaganda efforts==
{{see|Communist propaganda|Propaganda in the People's Republic of Poland|Propaganda in the Soviet Union}}
Communist leaders in the Eastern Bloc openly discussed the existence of propaganda efforts. Communist propaganda goals and techniques were tuned according to the target audience. The most broad classification of targets was:<ref name=clews>John C. Clews (1964) ''Communist Propaganda techniques'', printed in the USA by ''[[Frederick A. Praeger|Praeger]]'' and in Great Britain</ref> 
*Domestic propaganda
*External propaganda
*Propaganda of Communist supporters outside the Communist states

Communist Party documents reveal a more detailed classification of specific targets (workers, peasants, youth, women, etc.).<ref name=clews/>

Because the [[Communist Party]] was portrayed under [[Marxist-Leninist]] theory as the protagonist of history pushing toward the inevitable end result of historical materialism as a "vanguard of the working class", Party leaders were claimed to be as infallible and inevitable as the purported historical end itself.<ref name="Satter1"> [[David Satter]]. ''Age of Delirium: The Decline and Fall of the Soviet Union'', [[Yale University Press]], 2001, ISBN 0-300-08705-5</ref>  Propaganda often worked itself beyond [[agit prop]] plays into traditional productions, such as in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] after the [[Tito-Stalin split]], where the director of the National Theatre produced a version of ''Macbeth'' in which the villainous king was revealed as none other than hated (in the Eatsern Bloc) Yugoslavian Leader [[Josip Broz Tito]].<ref name="crampton269">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=269}}</ref>  Regarding economic woes, debilitating wage cuts following economic stagnation were referred to as "blows in the face of imperialism", while forced loans were called "voluntary contributions to the building of socialism".<ref name="crampton273">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=273}}</ref>

Communist theoretician [[Nikolai Bukharin]] in his ''[[The ABC of Communism]]'' wrote:<ref>[[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Yevgeny Preobrazhensky]] ''The ABC of Communism'' (1969 translation: ISBN 0140400052), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1920/abc/10.htm Chapter 10: Communism and Education]</ref> 
<blockquote>
The State propaganda of communism becomes in the long run a means for the eradication of the last traces of bourgeois propaganda dating from the old r<U+00E9>gime; and it is a powerful instrument for the creation of a new ideology, of new modes of thought, of a new outlook on the world.
</blockquote>
[[Image:West german tv penetration.svg|thumb|200px|right|Penetration of West German TV reception (grey) in East Germany for [[Das Erste|ARD]] (regional channels  [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]], [[Hessischer Rundfunk|HR]], [[Bayerischer Rundfunk|BR]] and [[Sender Freies Berlin|SFB]]) . Areas with no reception (black) were jokingly referred to as "Valley of the Clueless" ''(Tal der Ahnungslosen)'' while ARD was said to stand for "Au<U+00DF>er (except) R<U+00FC>gen und Dresden" .]]
Some propaganda would "retell" the western news, such as the [[East German]] television program [[Der schwarze Kanal]] ("The Black Channel"), which contained [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerized]] programs from [[Federal Republic of Germany|West Germany]] with added [[Communist]] commentary.<ref name="Hancock">{{cite web| url = http://www.transdiffusion.org/intertel/countries/gdr.php | title =  Fade to black | accessdate = 2006-02-20 | last = Hancock | first = Dafydd | date = 2001-01-01 | publisher = Intertel from Transdiffusion}}</ref> The name "Black channel" was a play on words deriving from the German language use of the term by plumbers to describe a sewer. The program was meant to counter ideas received by some from West German television because the geography of the divided [[Germany]] meant that West German television signals (particularly [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]) could be received in most of East Germany, except in parts of Eastern [[Saxony]] around Dresden, which consequently earned the latter the nickname "valley of the clueless."<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.iht.com/articles/1994/11/09/east.php | title = East Germany Struggles, 5 Years After Wall Fell | accessdate = 2007-05-12 | last = Mitchener | first = Brandon | date = 1994-11-09 | publisher = International Herald Tribune}}</ref>

Eastern Bloc leaders, including even [[Joseph Stalin]], could become personally involved in dissemination. For example, in January 1948, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] published a collection of documents titled ''Nazi-Soviet Relations, 1939<U+2013>1941: Documents from the Archives of The German Foreign Office'', which contained documents recovered from the Foreign Office of [[Nazi Germany]]<ref name="henig67"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=preface}}</ref> revealing Soviet conversations with Germany regarding the [[Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], including its secret protocol dividing eastern Europe,<ref name="roberts97">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=97}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=78}}</ref> the [[German<U+2013>Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|1939 German-Soviet Commercial Agreement]],<ref name="roberts97"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=32-77}}</ref> and [[German<U+2013>Soviet Axis talks|discussions of the Soviet Union potentially becoming the fourth Axis Power]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Churchill|1953|p=512-524}}</ref>  

In response, one month later, the [[Soviet Information Bureau]] published ''[[Falsifiers of History]]''.<ref name="henig67">{{Harvnb|Henig|2005|p=67}}</ref><ref name="roberts96"/> Stalin personally edited the book, rewriting entire chapters by hand.<ref name="roberts96">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=96}}</ref> The book claimed, for instance, that American bankers and industrialists provided capital for the growth of German war industries, while deliberately encouraging Hitler to expand eastward.<ref name="henig67"/><ref name="roberts97"/>  The book also included the claim that, during the Pact's operation, Stalin rejected Hitler's offer to share in a division of the world, without mentioning [[German<U+2013>Soviet Axis talks|the Soviet offers to join the Axis]].<ref name="nekrich202">{{Harvnb|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|p=202-205}}</ref>  Historical studies, official accounts, memoirs and textbooks published in the Soviet Union used that depiction of events [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|until the Soviet Union's dissolution]].<ref name="nekrich202"/>   

The book referred to "the American falsifiers and their British and French associates",<ref>{{Harvnb|Soviet Information Bureau|1948|p=9}}</ref> claimed "[a]s far back as in 1937 it became perfectly clear that a big war was being hatched by Hitler with the direct connivance of Great Britain and France",<ref>{{Harvnb|Soviet Information Bureau|1948|p=19}}</ref> blasted "the claptrap of the slanderers"<ref>{{Harvnb|Soviet Information Bureau|1948|p=45}}</ref> and stated "[n]aturally, the falsifiers of history and slanderers are called falsifiers and slanderers precisely because they do not entertain any respect for facts. They prefer to gossip and slander."<ref>{{Harvnb|Soviet Information Bureau|1948|p=65}}</ref>

In [[East Germany]], the Soviet SVAG and DVV initially controlled all publication prorities.<ref name="pike225"/> In the initial months of 1946, the Soviets were unsure how to merge propaganda and censorship efforts in East Germany.<ref name="pike225"/>  The SVAG engaged in a broad propaganda campaign that moved beyond customary political propaganda to engage in the practice at unions, women's organizations and youth organizations.<ref name="pike225"/>

==Attempts to circumvent the restrictions==
===Clandestine information passing===
{{main|Samizdat|Magnitizdat|Polish underground press}}
[[Samizdat]] was the clandestine copying and distribution of government-suppressed literature or other media in [[Eastern bloc]] countries. Copies were often made in small quantities of handwritten or typed documents, while recipients were expected to make additional copies. Samizdat traders used underground literature for self-analysis and self-expression under the heavy censorship of the Eastern Bloc.<ref>{{ru icon}} ''[http://www.memo.ru/history/diss/books/ALEXEEWA/Chapter16a.htm#_VPID_36 History of Dissident Movement in the USSR. The birth of Samizdat]'' by [[Ludmila Alekseyeva]].

[[Magnitizdat]] (in Russian <U+043C><U+0430><U+0433><U+043D><U+0438><U+0442><U+0438><U+0437><U+0434><U+0430><U+0442>) is a term used to describe the process of re-copying and self distributing live audio tape recordings in the Soviet Union that were not available commercially. The process of magnitizdat was less risky than publishing literature via samizdat, since any person in the USSR was permitted to own a private reel-to-reel tape recorder, while paper duplication equipment was under control of the state.  "Tamizdat" refers to literature published abroad (<U+0442><U+0430><U+043C>, tam, meaning "there"), often from smuggled manuscripts.

===Western media broadcasts===
{{see|British Broadcasting Corporation|Voice of America|Radio Free Europe}}
Western countries invested heavily in powerful transmitters which enabled broadcasters to be heard in the Eastern Bloc, despite attempts by authorities to [[radio jamming|jam]] such signals. In 1947, VOA started broadcasting in [[Russian language|Russian]] with the intent to counter Soviet propaganda directed against American leaders and policies.<ref name='whitton'>''Cold War Propaganda'' by John B. Whitton, [[The American Journal of International Law]], Vol. 45, No. 1 (Jan., 1951), pp. 151<U+2013>153</ref>  These included [[Radio Free Europe]] (RFE)), [[Rundfunk im amerikanischen Sektor|RIAS (Berlin)]] the [[Voice of America]]  (VOA), [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Radio France International]] and the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC).<ref name="frucht490">{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=490}}</ref>  The Soviet Union responded by attempting aggressive, electronic [[radio jamming|jamming]]  of VOA (and some other Western) broadcasts om 1949.<ref name='whitton'/>  The [[BBC World Service]] similarly broadcast language-specific programming to countries behind the [[Iron Curtain]].  

RFE was developed out of a belief that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means.<ref>{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=7}}</ref> In January 1950, it obtained a transmitter base at [[Lampertheim]], [[West Germany]] and on July 4 of the same year, RFE completed its first broadcast aimed at [[Czechoslovakia]]<ref>Mickelson, Sig, "America's Other Voice: the Story of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty" (New York: Praeger Publishers, 1983): Mickelson 30.</ref> Broadcasts were often banned in Eastern Europe and Communist authorities used sophisticated [[jamming]] techniques in an attempt to prevent citizens from listening to them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=214}}</ref>   In late 1950, RFE began to assemble a full-fledged foreign broadcast staff, and became more than just a "mouthpiece for exiles" who had fled Eastern Bloc countries.<ref>{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=37}}</ref> While RFE was cleared of charges that it gave Hungarian listeners false hope during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], its Broadcast Analysis Division was established to ensure that broadcasts were accurate and professional while maintaining the journalists' former [[autonomy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=117}}</ref>

A 1960 study concluded that RFE possessed considerably more listeners than the BBC or VOA.<ref name="puddington131"/> The study concluded that the BBC was regarded as the most objective and the VOA had suffered a notable decline since it stopped critical broadcasts on the communist world after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], focusing instead on world news, American culture and jazz.<ref name="puddington131">{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=131}}</ref>
