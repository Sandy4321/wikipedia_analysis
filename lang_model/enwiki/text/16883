{{dablink|This article is about the 2003 Atlantic hurricane; for other storms with this name, see [[Hurricane Claudette]].}}

'''Hurricane Claudette''' was the third tropical storm and first [[hurricane]] of the [[2003 Atlantic hurricane season]]. A fairly long-lived July [[Atlantic hurricane]], Claudette began as a tropical wave in the eastern [[Caribbean Sea]]. It moved quickly westward, brushing past the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]] before moving northwestward through the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Claudette remained a tropical storm until just before making landfall in [[Port O'Connor, Texas]], when it quickly strengthened to a strong Category 1 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. Forecasting of its path and intensity was uncertain throughout its lifetime, resulting in widespread and often unnecessary preparations along its path.

Claudette was the first hurricane to make landfall in July in the [[United States]] since [[Hurricane Danny (1997)|Hurricane Danny]] in the [[1997 Atlantic hurricane season|1997 season]]. The hurricane caused one death and moderate damage in [[Texas]], mostly from strong winds, as well as extensive beach erosion. Because of the damage, President [[George W. Bush]] declared portions of South Texas as a Federal Disaster Area, allowing the affected citizens to apply for aid. Claudette also caused significant rainfall and minor damage in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Quintana Roo]] as a tropical storm, as well as minor damage on [[Saint Lucia]] before developing into a tropical cyclone.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Claudette 2003 track.png}}
A [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[July 1]]. It steadily organized as it moved westward, and resembled a tropical depression by [[July 7]]. However, surface reports and [[Reconnaissance Aircraft|reconnaissance aircraft]] indicated the system did not have tropical characteristics, and remained simply a low-pressure system. The wave produced tropical storm-force winds as it moved through the [[Lesser Antilles]] on [[July 8]], but did not acquire tropical characteristics until it reached the eastern [[Caribbean Sea]]. Because it had tropical storm-force winds, the system was upgraded immediately to Tropical Storm Claudette after it developed a low-level circulation later on [[July 8]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2003|title=National Hurricane Center Claudette Report|accessdate=2006-05-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003claudette.shtml}}</ref>

By early on [[July 9]], while south of [[Puerto Rico]], Claudette quickly strengthened over the warm waters of the Caribbean, and its strongest winds were just shy of the threshold for hurricane intensity. Possibly due to its fast forward motion, the storm became disorganized and weakened. Conditions briefly became more favorable over the western Caribbean, and Claudette reached hurricane status for six hours on the 10th. Soon after, the storm encounted unfavorable upper-level winds and weakened back into a tropical storm. In response to a break in the [[Atlantic_hurricane#Steering_factors|subtropical ridge]]&mdash;a high-pressure ridge that often prevents tropical systems from moving northward&mdash;it turned to the west-northwest. Claudette made its first [[landfall]] at [[Puerto Morelos]] on the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]] on the 11th as a tropical storm with 60&nbsp;[[mph]] (95&nbsp;[[km/h]]) winds.<ref name="tcr"/>

[[Image:Hurricane_Claudette_(2003).jpg|thumb|right|Hurricane Claudette off the coast of [[Texas]]]]

Claudette moved to the northwest over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and gradually restrengthened. Upper-level winds steadily decreased, and Claudette again became a hurricane late on [[July 14]]. It strengthened quickly prior to [[landfall]], and struck [[Port O'Connor, Texas]] on [[July 15]] as a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] with 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h) winds. Some initial estimates suggested that Claudette had reached Category&nbsp;2 status, with sustained winds of up to 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h); these were based on unofficial observations which were not backed up by official data.<ref name="tcr"/>

As slow as Claudette was to strengthen, it was also slow to dissipate over land. It maintained tropical storm intensity for over 24&nbsp;hours after landfall, a rarity for such a weak storm; most tropical systems weaken rapidly after landfall, as they are separated from the warm waters that power them. The storm finally lost its low-level circulation early on [[July 17]], although its rainfall and upper-level circulation continued into the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref name="tcr"/>

==Preparations==
[[Mexico|Mexican]] officials issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] 37&nbsp;hours prior to the storm's landfall between [[Chetumal]] and [[Cabo Catoche]], [[Quintana Roo]]. The warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning about a day before landfall, but was downgraded when Claudette weakened just 13 hours prior to its landfall in the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]].<ref name="tcr"/> The Mexican government declared a state of emergency in the projected path of the storm, and declared an evacuation order for 1,500 citizens in Quintana Roo. There, residents remained calm during the evacuation.<ref name="mexevac">{{cite web|author=Agence France-Presse (AFP)|year=2003|title=Mexico declares state of emergency, evacuates residents in path of Claudette|accessdate=2006-05-01|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/ACOS-64C5PG?OpenDocument}}</ref>
Tourists left nightclubs for supermarkets to stock up, among other items, beer, a comodity that was banned at midnight. Schools were set up as shelters, while police forced tourists to remain in their hotels.<ref name="mexevac2">{{cite news|author=Pav Jordan|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Claudette makes for Mexico's Yucatan|publisher=Reuters Foundation|accessdate=2006-05-01|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/ACOS-64D9U4?OpenDocument}}</ref>

On [[July 13]], two days prior to Claudette's eventual landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watch]] between [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]] and [[Port O'Connor, Texas]]. By the next day, a hurricane warning existed from [[Baffin Bay, Texas|Baffin Bay]] to [[High Island, Texas]], while a tropical storm warning extended from High Island to [[Intracoastal City, Louisiana]]. When it became apparent that Louisiana would not be affected significantly by the storm, the state's tropical storm warnings were cancelled.<ref name="tcr"/> In [[Texas]], [[Calhoun County, Texas|Calhoun County]] officials issued a voluntary evacuation for western [[Galveston Island]] and [[Jamaica Beach, Texas|Jamaica Beach]] 24 hours prior to Claudette's projected landfall. The Emergency Phone Notification System notified citizens in the evening to avoid evacuating during the night. Many citizens heeded the evacuation suggestion, some of whom remembered the flooding from [[Tropical Storm Frances (1998)|Tropical Storm Frances]] five years before.<ref name="jam">{{cite web|author=Jim O'Donnel|year=2003|title=Jamaica Beach Texas Preliminary Claudette Report|accessdate=2006-05-01|url=http://members.aol.com/IslandWx/jbclimo/tropicalcyclone/reports/2003/claudette.htm}}</ref>  Claudette's consistent variation in its path caused uncertainty over the strength and location of its final landfall, and because of this, no shelters were open during the passage of Claudette, forcing citizens to ride out the hurricane.<ref name="tcr"/><ref name="calhoun">{{cite web|author=Texas Department of Health, Bureau of Emergency Management|year=2006|title=Hurricane Claudette visits Calhoun County|accessdate=2006-05-01|url=http://www.tdh.state.tx.us/hcqs/ems/SO03HurricaneClaudette.htm}}</ref>

Hurricane Claudette also affected the [[2003 world oil market chronology|oil industry]]. [[Chevron]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Oil]], [[Marathon Oil]], [[Unocal Corporation]], and [[Anadarko Petroleum Corporation]] all limited production and evacuated many of their workers. Chevron, which evacuated more than 1,800 workers in the Gulf of Mexico, lost about 30% of its daily production, which included 92,000 barrels of oil and 236&nbsp;million&nbsp;cubic&nbsp;feet (6.7&nbsp;million&nbsp;cubic&nbsp;meters) of natural gas each day.  Shell limited their crude production to about 15% of their pre-storm levels, and daily natural gas production dropped 96%. Similarly, Marathon's oil ouptut during the storm shrunk to 2% of normal production, and its natural gas output dropped to 1.5%. Unocal temporarily closed 23 rigs, and Anadarko shut down 11 rigs for the storm's duration.<ref name="oil">{{cite news|author=Erwin Seba|year=2003|title=Storm Threat Shuts Gulf Oil Production|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2006-05-01|url=http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/21495/newsDate/14-Jul-2003/story.htm}}</ref> In total, the storm shut down 21% of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]'s crude oil production and 18% of its natural gas output.<ref name="MMS Claudette">{{cite web|author=[[Minerals Management Service]], [[U.S. Department of the Interior]]|year=July 13, 2003|title=Hurricane Claudette Evacuation and Production Statistics as of July 15, 2003|accessdate=2006-05-23|url=http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/whatsnew/newsreal/030715.html}}</ref>

==Impact==
[[Image:Claudette (2003) Rainfall totals.gif|right|thumb|Rainfall totals from Claudette]]
Outside of [[Texas]], Hurricane Claudette caused little damage due to its low intensity. In total, damage estimates rose to $180&nbsp;million (2003 [[USD]]), and the storm caused one direct and two indirect deaths. One of the indirect deaths occurred from a man having a heart attack while surfing in the eastern [[Gulf of Mexico]].<ref name="tcr"/>

===Caribbean Sea===
As a tropical wave, Claudette dropped torrential rainfall and brought strong winds to the island of [[Saint Lucia]]. The [[George F. L. Charles Airport]] in [[Castries]] reported a wind gust of 52&nbsp;[[mph]] (84&nbsp;[[km/h]]), while other parts of the island experienced nearly horizontal rainfall from the gusts. On the northern and eastern portions of the island, the strong winds ripped off roops and downed trees across roadways.<ref name="stluc">{{cite web|year=2003|title=Unofficial Reports from Saint Lucia|publisher=Stormcarib.net|url=http://stormcarib.com/reports/2003/stlucia.shtml}}</ref> Overall, damage was light, and amounted to $1.1 million (2003 USD).<ref name="stdam">{{cite news|author=National Emergency Management Organisation|year=2003|title=Saint Lucia: More than EC$3m in damage from Tropical Storm Claudette|publisher=Government of Saint Lucia|accessdate=2006-05-01|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/OCHA-64BTLB?OpenDocument}}</ref>

In the [[Dominican Republic]], the outer bands of the storm caused moderate rainfall of up to 3&nbsp;inches (80&nbsp;mm) in [[Santo Domingo]]. Winds gusted up to 45&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;km/h), knocking down trees, sign posts, and iron roofs. Also, flooding in metropolitan areas blocked traffic for cars and pedestrians. Banana and other fruit plantations in the southwestern portion of the country experienced severe damage, although exact damage totals are unknown.<ref name="domdam">{{cite web|author=World Meteorological Organization|year=2003|title=2003 hurricane season tropical cyclone impacts on the Dominican Republic|accessdate=2006-05-04|format=PDF|url=http://www.wmo.ch/web/www/TCP/Reports/HC26-English.pdf}}</ref>

On [[Jamaica]], the storm caused wind gusts of 45&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;km/h) in [[Montego Bay, Jamaica|Montego Bay]].<ref name="tcr"/> Forecasters predicted high tides, strong waves, and up to 6&nbsp;inches (150&nbsp;mm) of rain on the island, although exact post-storm totals are not known.<ref name="jam1">{{cite web|author=Reuters|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Claudette Aims for Yucatan|accesstate=2006-05-01|url=http://www.planetark.org/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/21456/newsDate/10-Jul-2003/story.htm}}</ref> Many fishermen moved their boats from the water to safety, while a cruise line diverted three ships away from Claudette's path.<ref name="jam2">{{cite web|author=CBS News|year=2003|title=Claudette Nears Jamaica|accessdate=2006-05-01|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/07/10/world/main562699.shtml}}</ref>

[[Image:Claudette off Yucatan.jpg|left|thumb|Claudette hitting the Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]]

In the [[Cayman Islands]], where the storm remained 165&nbsp;miles (265&nbsp;km) away at its closest point, rainfall totals ranged from 1&ndash;3&nbsp;inches (25&ndash;75&nbsp;mm).<ref name="tcr"/> On the south side of [[Grand Cayman]], Claudette caused wave heights of around 10&nbsp;feet (3&nbsp;m), while the western side received little precipitation. Also on Grand Cayman, the storm caused winds of 35&ndash;40&nbsp;mph (55&ndash;65&nbsp;km/h), causing minor tree damage but little else.<ref name="cayman">{{cite web|year=2003|title=Unofficial Reports from the Cayman Islands|accessdate=2006-05-01|url=http://stormcarib.com/reports/2003/cayman.shtml}}</ref>

On [[Mexico]]'s [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]], Claudette lashed strong waves against the coastline at [[Canc<U+00FA>n]], but overall caused light damage.<ref name="usa">{{cite news|year=2003|title=Claudette's damage light in Cancun|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2006-05-01|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/hurricane/2003-07-11-claudette-cancun_x.htm}}</ref> While crossing the peninsula, the storm dropped moderate rainfall, including a total of 3.22&nbsp;inches (81&nbsp;mm) in Canc<U+00FA>n.<ref name="tcr"/> Winds were moderate, causing the [[Canc<U+00FA>n International Airport]] to delay several flights, though there were no cancellations. Overall, Claudette sank a few small boats and flooded a few streets in Canc<U+00FA>n, though damage was minor in the Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula.<ref name="usa"/>{{clear}}

===Texas===
[[Image:Claudette Damage (2003).jpg|right|thumb|Overview of damage in [[Palacios, Texas|Palacios]]]]
Upon making landfall on the central [[Texas]] coast, Claudette's [[storm surge]] reached a maximum height of 5.3&nbsp;feet (1.6&nbsp;m) in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]]. [[Freeport, Texas|Freeport]] reported a "storm tide"&mdash;the overall rise of water over the mean low tide&mdash;of 9.15&nbsp;feet (2.8&nbsp;m). Claudette produced moderate rainfall across southern Texas, peaking at 6.5&nbsp;inches (165&nbsp;mm) in [[Tilden, Texas|Tilden]]. In [[Matagorda Island|Matagorda]], the local weather station measured winds of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h)&mdash;the only official report of hurricane-force winds along the coastline. However, several offshore oil rigs reported winds of up to 90&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h), and one unofficial reading in [[Seadrift, Texas|Seadrift]] indicated winds of 96.6&nbsp;mph (156&nbsp;km/h). This report would suggest the storm was a low-end [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 2 hurricane]], though this contradicted [[Hurricane Hunters]]' data, which pointed to a storm of a lesser intensity.<ref name="tcr"/>

[[Image:Claudette Erosion.JPG|left|thumb|Beach erosion caused by Claudette]]

Severe beach erosion occurred from [[High Island]] to [[Freeport, Texas|Freeport]], though large [[geo-tube]]s reduced the erosion on [[Galveston Island]] and the [[Bolivar Peninsula]].<ref name="setex">{{cite web|author=National Weather Service at Houston/Galveston|year=2003|title=Upper Texas Coast Tropical Cyclones in the 2000s|accessdate=2006-05-01|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hgx/hurricanes/2000s.htm}}</ref> The outer bands of the hurricane spawned two tornadoes. One was an F1 on the [[Fujita scale]] that caused damage to several buildings in [[Palacios, Texas|Palacios]], and the other damaged homes in [[Port Lavaca, Texas|Port Lavaca]].<ref name="tcr"/>

Widespread flooding and gusty winds destroyed 204 houses along the southeast Texas coastline, most of which occurred in [[Matagorda County, Texas|Matagorda County]]. In addition, the winds damaged 1,407 homes, with 144 of them being severely damaged. The wind also affected 147 businesses, of which 64 were either destroyed or severely damaged.<ref name="setex"/> Strong winds downed numerous power lines, leaving around 74,000 residents without power in the immediate aftermath.<ref name="cnn">{{cite news|author=Martin Savidge and Ed Lavandera|year=2003|publisher=CNN.com|title=Two dead in Claudette's wake|accessdate=2006-05-01|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WEATHER/07/15/claudette/}}</ref> Overall, Claudette caused $180&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD) in damage in Texas and one death from a fallen tree during the storm. Also, the storm was indirectly responsible for a death when a tree fell on a person in the aftermath of the storm.<ref name="tcr"/>

==Aftermath==
On [[July 17]], President [[George W. Bush]] declared 18 south [[Texas]] counties as a federal disaster area. Within 2&nbsp;months of the storm, over 15,000&nbsp;citizens registered for assistance.<ref name="aid">[http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=4947 September 15 Deadline Nears]</ref> The government approved $34.8&nbsp;million in aid, of which nearly half went to basic house repairs. FEMA provided 75% of the $1.35&nbsp;million debris removal cost, with the other 25% being covered through local agencies.<ref name="debris">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=2003|title=FEMA Funds Claudette Debris Removal|accessdate=2006-05-01|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=7295}}</ref> FEMA also provided $1.26&nbsp;million to repair geo-tubes on the [[Bolivar Peninsula]] in [[Galveston County]]. The geo-tubes, which protect buildings along coastal areas, were severely damaged by the hurricane.<ref name="geotube">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=2003|title=FEMA Funds Geo-Tube Repairs|accessdate=2006-05-01|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=7296}}</ref>

In western Texas, heavy rainfall of up to 5&nbsp;inches (130&nbsp;mm) temporarily turned the typically arid landscape into an area rife with flowers. The rainfall restored the flow of the [[Rio Grande]] at [[Big Bend National Park]], which had ceased in the area due to lack of rainfall. In addition, it increased the water level in the [[Amistad National Recreation Area]] to 4&nbsp;feet (1.2&nbsp;m).<ref name="setexweather">{{cite web|title=Texas Weather Information|year=2006|accessdate=2006-05-01|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~wxwatcher/wx_072603.htm}}</ref>

The [[World Meteorological Organization]] did not consider the damage to be significant enough to warrant retiring the name Claudette, and as a result it will be used again in the {{tcseason|2009|Atlantic|hurricane}}.
