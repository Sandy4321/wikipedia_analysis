==Early life and activities prior to formation of NDH==
Franceti<U+0107> was born in [[Oto<U+010D>ac]] on 3 July 1912.<ref> Srednja Bosna: ne zaboravimo hrvatske <U+017E>rtve: 1941-50/1991-95 by Vjenceslav Topalovi<U+0107>, Hrvatski informativni centar, 2001 ISBN 9536058324, 9789536058327</ref> After gymnasium (high school) he went to study law at the University of Zagreb, were he joined the Usta<U+0161>a movement. Soon after, he was exiled from Zagreb for five years as a result of his anti-Yugoslav political activities. He stayed in Oto<U+010D>ac for a short time before emigrating to [[Italy]] in March 1933. He took the Usta<U+0161>a oath in the [[Borgo Val di Taro|Borgotaro]] camp on 24 April 1933, and then spent the following four years in [[Austria]], [[Italy]] and [[Hungary]]. In Hungary he joined the Ustashe terrorist group camp at Jankapuszta as "Laszlo".<ref>Usta<U+0161>ki pokret, 1929<U+2013>1941: pregled njegove poviesti by Miron Kre<U+0161>imir Begi<U+0107>, Naklada Smotre "Usta<U+0161>a" (pg. 212), 1986</ref>

After the assassination of [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]], Franceti<U+0107> was interned on [[Sardinia]] by Mussolini at the request of the Yugoslav government. After a general declaration of amnesty in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], Franceti<U+0107> returned to Croatia in November 1937,<ref>Holokaust u Zagrebu by Ivo Goldstein, Novi liber (pg. 99), Zagreb, 2001<!-- ISBN#? --></ref> but was immediately arrested and exiled to his hometown. The next year Franceti<U+0107> returned to Zagreb hoping to complete his study of law but was forced to complete his military service instead. In late 1940 he was arrested in Zagreb due to a congratulatory telegraph to Dr. [[Jozef Tiso]], president of the newly formed [[Slovak Republic (1939<U+2013>1945)|Slovak Republic]], signed by a number of Croat nationalists. He was again exiled to his native Oto<U+010D>ac. After delivering an inflammatory nationalistic speech at a local school's New Year's celebration in Oto<U+010D>ac on 12 January 1941, he escaped to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] to avoid another arrest. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==War crimes==
Franceti<U+0107> earned his only military education and officer rank while serving the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Army. He became a non-commissioned officer in the rank of sergeant.<ref>Bez alternative by Jakov Bla<U+017E>evi<U+0107> (pg. 477), "Mladost", 1980</ref> Regarding Franceti<U+0107>'s military experience and knowledge, [[Eugen Dido Kvaternik]] wrote: ''"He did not have basic military knowledge and military education, nor did he have any talent for basic military organization."''<ref>''Provokacija ili Manipulacija?'' by <U+017D>eljka Godec, ''Nacional'', [[Zagreb, Croatia]]: 15 June 2000, quote from Kvaternik's memoir</ref> After establishment of the Independent State of Croatia in April 1941 he and 10 others organized the Black Legion (Croatian: [[Crna Legija]]). Franceti<U+0107> became the leader of the Black Legion and earned the rank of colonel in the [[Usta<U+0161>a]] army. Kvaternik believed that Franceti<U+0107> ''"a born guerrilla and a son of our mountainous Hercegovina"'' which was sufficient reason to put him in the role of military leader in Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref>''Sje<U+0107>anja i zapa<U+017E>anja, 1925-1945: prilozi za hrvatsku povijest'' by Eugen Kvaternik and Jere Jareb, "Star<U+010D>evi<U+0107>" Publishing House, 1995; ISBN 9539636906, ISBN 9789539636904</ref> 

He was named chief Ustasha delegate in Bosnia and Herzegovina and much of the party work in the province was put in the hands of Roman Catholic priests in order to consolidate the Ustashe party power, the most important of whom included Father Bo<U+017E>idar Brekalo, a parish priest in Sarajevo, and Father Dragutin Kamber, a parish priest in Doboj, both proteges of then Archbishop [[Ivan <U+0160>ari<U+0107>]].<ref>''War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941-1945: Occupation and Collaboration'' (pg. 490), by Jozo Tomasevich, published by [[Stanford University Press]], 2001; ISBN 0804736154, ISBN 9780804736152</ref>Franceti<U+0107>'s Ustashe took control over the local administration by dismissing all civil servants and teachers belonging to the category of "Srbijanci", as well as Jews. Killings, arrests, and deportation of Serbs and Jews was a regular duty of Franceti<U+0107>'s henchmen<U+2014>based and justified by the official Ustashe policy which demanded the total extermination of Jews and the murder (1/3) and/or expulsion (1/3) and/or forced conversion (1/3) to the Roman Catholicism of the ethnic Serbian Orthodox population in Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref>''Utopias of Nation: Local Mass Killing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1941<U+2013>42'' by Tomislav Duli<U+0107>, [[University of Uppsala|Uppsala Universitet]], 2005 (pgs. 124, 132-3)</ref>
