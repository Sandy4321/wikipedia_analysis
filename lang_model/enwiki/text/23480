'''Greek love''' is a concept of [[homoeroticism]] within the [[classical tradition]]. In the [[history of sexuality]], it is one of the "classically inspired erotic imaginings" by means of which later cultures have articulated their own [[discourse]] about [[homosexuality]]. The [[metaphor]] of "Greek love" becomes most vivid historically in periods when the [[reception theory|reception]] of [[classical antiquity]] is an important influence on dominant [[art movement|aesthetic]] or [[Intellectual history|intellectual movements]].<ref>Alastair J.L. Blanshard, "Greek Love," in ''Sex: Vice and Love from Antiquity to Modernity'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), pp. xi and 91<U+2013>92 ''et passim''.</ref>

"Greek love" should not be understood as referring specifically to historical [[homosexuality in ancient Greece|homosexual practices in ancient Greece]], but to the conceptualizing of those practices among other cultures:

<blockquote>
'Greece' as the historical memory of a treasured past was romanticised and idealised as a time and a culture when love between men was not only tolerated but actually encouraged, and expressed as the high ideal of same-sex camaraderie. <U+2026> If tolerance and approval of [[male homosexuality]] had happened once <U+2014> and in a culture so much admired and imitated by the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries <U+2014> might it not be possible to replicate in [[modernity]] the antique homeland of the non-[[heteronormative]]?<ref>{{cite book |title = Translation, translation| last=Petrilli| first= Susan| publisher = Rodopi|date = November 14, 2003| pages = 624| isbn=978-9042009479 }}</ref></blockquote>

Following the work of sexuality theorist [[Michel Foucault]], the validity of an ancient Greek model for modern [[gay culture]] has been questioned.<ref>Blanshard, "Greek Love," p. 161; Didier Eriobon, ''Insult and the Making of the Gay Self'', translated by Michael Lucey (Duke University Press, 2004), p. xxxiv.</ref>

==Ancient Greek background==
{{Main|Homosexuality in ancient Greece|Pederasty in ancient Greece}}
[[File:Zeus-Gany-sculpt1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|125px|Zeus carrying away Ganymede ''([[Archaic Greece|Late Archaic]] terracotta)]]
In his classic study ''Greek Homosexuality'', [[Kenneth Dover]] points out that the English nouns "a [[homosexual]]" and "a [[heterosexual]]" have no equivalent in the [[ancient Greek language]]. While individuals might differ in their [[sexual preference]]s, it was assumed that a person would have both hetero- and homosexual responses at different times.<ref>[[Kenneth Dover|K.J. Dover]], ''Greek Homosexuality'' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 1 ''et passim''.</ref> Evidence for same-sex attractions and behaviors is more abundant for men than for women. By far the most common male-male relationship was ''[[Pederasty in ancient Greece#Terminology|paiderasteia]]'', a socially-acknowledged institution in which a mature male (''[[erast<U+0113>s]]'', the active lover) bonded with or mentored a teen-aged youth<ref>David Sacks, ''A Dictionary of the Ancient Greek World'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), pp. 115<U+2013>115.</ref> (''[[eromenos]]'', the passive lover, or ''pais'', "boy" understood as an endearment and not necessarily a category of age<ref>Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'', p. 16; Marguerite Johnson and Terry Ryan, ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society and Literature: A Sourcebook'' (Routledge, 2005), pp. 3<U+2013>4; Anne L. Klinck, "'Sleeping in the Bosom of a Tender Companion': Homoerotic Attachments in Sappho," in ''Same-sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West'' (Haworth Press, 2005), p. 202; Jane McIntosh Snyder, ''The Woman and the Lyre'' (Southern Illinois University Press, 1989), p. 3.</ref>).

[[Ancient Greek art|Greek art]] and [[ancient Greek literature|literature]] portray these relationships as sometimes erotic or sexual, or sometimes idealized, educational, non-consummated, or non-sexual. These erotic images can be found most commonly painted on pottery. A distinctive feature of Greek male-male [[eros (concept)|eros]] was its occurrence or encouragement [[Homosexuality in the militaries of ancient Greece|within a military setting]], as with the [[Theban Band]].<ref>''A Dictionary of the Ancient Greek World'', pp. 115<U+2013>117.</ref>

Some [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] have been interpreted as reflecting the custom of ''paiderasteia'', most notably the myth of [[Zeus]] kidnapping [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]] to become his cupbearer in the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] [[symposium]].<ref>''A Dictionary of the Ancient Greek World'', p. 117; </ref> The death of [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinthus]] is also frequently referenced as a pederastic myth.

The main Greek literary sources for Greek homosexuality are lyric poetry, Athenian comedy, the works of [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]], and courtroom speeches from Athens. [[Ancient Greek pottery|Vase paintings]] from the 500s and 400s BC depict courtship and sex between males.<ref>''A Dictionary of the Ancient Greek World'', p. 115.</ref>

==Ancient Rome==
{{See also|Homosexuality in ancient Rome|Sexuality in ancient Rome}}

In [[Latin]], ''mos Graeciae'' or ''mos Graecorum'' ("Greek custom" or "the way of the Greeks") refers to a variety of behaviors the ancient Romans regarded as Greek, and not to any specific sexual practice.<ref>Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'' (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2010), pp. 61, 70, 308, 342 (examples in note 53).</ref> Homosexual behaviors at Rome were acceptable only within an inherently unequal relationship; male Roman citizens retained their masculinity as long as they took the active, penetrating role, and the appropriate male sexual partner was a prostitute or slave, who would nearly always be non-Roman.<ref>Helen King, "Sowing the Field: Greek and Roman Sexology," in ''Sexual Knowledge, Sexual Science: The History of Attitudes to Sexuality'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994), p. 30.</ref> Effeminacy or a lack of discipline in managing one's sexual attraction to another male threatened a man's "Romanness" and thus might be disparaged as "Eastern" or "Greek." Slaves often were given, and prostitutes sometimes assumed, Greek names regardless of their ethnic origin; the boys ''(pueri)'' to whom the poet [[Martial]] is attracted have Greek names.<ref>Sandra R. Joshel, ''Slavery in the Roman World'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 78 and 95; John G. Younger, ''Sex in the Ancient World from A to Z'' (Routledge, 2005), p. 38.</ref> The [[Hellenization]] of elite culture as a kind of luxury import influenced sexual attitudes among "avant-garde, [[philhellenism|philhellenic]] Romans."<ref>John Pollini, "The Warren Cup: Homoerotic Love and Symposial Rhetoric in Silver," ''Art Bulletin'' 81.1 (1999), p. 28.</ref> As a form of literary and aesthetic [[conspicuous consumption]], "homosexuality was for the rich," in the view of [[Ramsay MacMullen]].<ref>[[Ramsay MacMullen]], "Roman Attitudes to Greek Love," ''Historia'' 31.4 (1982) p. 498.</ref> No assumptions or generalizations should be made about any effect on [[sexual orientation]] or behavior;<ref>David M. Halperin, "The First Homosexuality?" in ''The Sleep of Reason: Erotic Experience and Sexual Ethics in Ancient Greece '' (University of Chicago Press, 2002), pp. 242 and 263, with criticism of MacMullen.</ref> rather, the elevation of [[ancient Greek literature|Greek literature]] and [[Ancient Greek art|art]] as models of expression caused homoeroticism to be regarded as urbane and sophisticated.<ref>MacMullen, "Roman Attitudes to Greek Love," pp. 484<U+2013>502.</ref>

There were fears, however, that Greek models might affect behavior and corrupt traditional Roman social codes (the ''[[mos maiorum]]''). A [[Lex Scantinia|vaguely documented law]] that was passed during this period of Hellenization attempted to regulate aspects of homosexual relationships between freeborn males, perhaps to protect Roman youth from older men emulating [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Greek customs of pederasty]].<ref>Pollini, "Warren Cup," p. 27, with reference to the [[Lex Scantinia]]; Jan Bremmer, "An Enigmatic Indo-European Rite: Paederasty," ''Arethusa'' 13.2 (1980), p. 288.</ref> Sexual behaviors also played a role in 186 BC in the [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|suppression of the Bacchanalia]], an imported "Greek" rite conducted with a secrecy that was antithetical to the [[Religion in ancient Rome|public cult practices of ancient Rome]]. Conservative Romans expressed anxieties that young freeborn males would be led astray and undergo anal penetration <!--this is the interpretation of Pollini as to what Livy means, which needs illuminating by some additional sources-->during the required [[initiation]] <U+2014> whether or not such sexual behaviors were an actual part of the rites.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita]]'' 39.13.14, as cited and discussed by Pollini, "Warren Cup," p. 28. See also Bremmer, "An Enigmatic Indo-European Rite," p. 287.</ref>

By the close of the 2nd century BC, however, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Quintus Lutatius Catulus]] was among a circle of poets who made short, light [[Hellenistic poetry|Hellenistic poems]] fashionable in the [[Roman Republic#Late Republic (147 BC - 30 BC)|late Republic]]. One of his few surviving fragments is a poem of desire addressed to a male with a Greek name, signaling a new aesthetic in Roman culture.<ref>[[Eva Cantarella]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992, 2002, originally published 1988 in Italian), p. 120; Edward Courtney, ''The Fragmentary Latin Poets'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992), p. 75.</ref> The Hellenizing of [[Latin literature]] in the "[[neoteric|new poetry]]" came to fruition in the 50s BC with [[Gaius Valerius Catullus]], whose poems, written in forms adapted from [[List of classical meters|Greek meters]], include several expressing desire for a freeborn youth explicitly named "Youth" ''(Iuventius)''. His Latin name and free-born status subvert pederastic tradition at Rome. Catullus, however, more often addresses his poems to a woman,<ref>Pollini, "Warren Cup," p. 28.</ref> and while the theme of boy-love is found in his successors [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|writing during the reign of Augustus]], by the end of the Augustan period [[Ovid]], Rome's leading literary figure, declares the fashion dead: making love with a woman is more enjoyable, he says, because unlike pederastic sex it's mutual.<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'' 2.683<U+2013>684; Pollini, "Warren Cup," p. 36.</ref>

[[File:Warren Cup BM GR 1999.4-26.1 n1.jpg|thumb|150px|"Greek" side of the [[Warren Cup]] depicting a mature, bearded male and a youth]]

The Hellenization of Roman culture occurred in large part as a result of the Roman conquest of Greece. Roman attitudes toward Greek culture were thus ambivalent: while it was admired as superior in the arts and intellectual pursuits, Roman superiority was asserted in matters of morality, and sometimes simply asserted. In [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[classical Greece]], ''paiderasteia'' had been a formal social relationship between freeborn males; taken out of context, and imported into Rome as the luxury product of a conquered people, pederasty came to express roles based on domination and exploitation.<ref>Pollini, "Warren Cup," pp. 37, 40<U+2013>41 ''et passim''.</ref> The literary ideal celebrated by Catullus stands in contrast to the practice of elite Romans who kept a ''[[Homosexuality in ancient Rome#Puer delicatus|puer delicatus]]'' ("exquisite boy") as a form of high-status sexual consumption, a practice that continued well into the [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]]. The ''puer delicatus'' was a slave chosen from the pages who served in a high-ranking household. He was selected for his good looks and grace to serve at his master's side, where he is often depicted in art. Among his duties, at a ''[[convivium]]'' he would enact the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] role of [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], the [[Troy|Trojan]] youth [[raptio|abducted]] by [[Zeus]] who served as a divine [[cupbearer]].<ref>Pollini, "Warren Cup," p. 34.</ref> Attacks on emperors such as [[Nero]] and [[Elagabalus]], whose young male partners accompanied them in public for official ceremonies, criticized the perceived "Greekness" of male-male sexuality.<ref>Caroline Vout, ''Power and Eroticism in Imperial Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), [http://books.google.com/books?id=icxZpoRE-RIC&pg=PA136&dq=%22greek+love%22+inauthor:caroline+inauthor:vout&hl=en&ei=11-dTsBx5YqxAuvzqesJ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22greek%20love%22%20inauthor%3Acaroline%20inauthor%3Avout&f=false p. 136ff.]</ref>

The reception of Greek pederasty at Rome thus had a dual character, reflected on the piece of [[convivium|convivial]] silver known as the [[Warren Cup]]. It has been argued that the two sides of this cup represent the two pederastic traditions at Rome, the Greek in contrast to the Roman. On the "Greek" side, a bearded, mature man is mounted by a young but muscularly developed male, probably meant to be 17 or 18. A child-slave watches the scene furtively through a door ajar. The "Roman" side of the cup shows a ''puer delicatus'', age 12 to 13, held for intercourse in the arms of an older male, clean-shaven and fit. The bearded pederast may be Greek, with a partner who participates more freely and with a look of pleasure. His counterpart, who has a more severe haircut, appears to be Roman, and thus uses a slave boy; the myrtle wreath he wears symbolizes his role as an erotic conqueror.<ref>Pollini, "Warren Cup," pp. 35<U+2013>37, 42.</ref> The cup may have been designed as a [[conversation piece]] to provoke the kind of dialogue on ideals of love and sex that took place at a Greek [[symposium]], but its antiquity has been challenged.<ref>Pollini, "Warren Cup," p. 37. M.T. Marabini Moevs has challenged the antiquity of the cup and dates it to the turn of the 19th<U+2013>20th centuries; see <U+201C>Per una storia del gusto: riconsiderazioni sul Calice Warren,<U+201D> Ministero per i Beni e le Attivit<U+00E0> Culturali ''Bollettino d<U+2019>Arte'' 146 (Oct.<U+2013>Dec. 2008) 1-16. Thus the subject matter depicted on the cup would express a dual Greek-Roman tradition of pederasty, as received and interpreted in another cultural milieu. John R. Clarke, ''Looking at Lovemaking: Constructions of Sexuality in Roman Art 100 B.C.<U+2013>A.D. 250'' (University of California Press, 1998, 2001), p. 61, asserts that the Warren cup is valuable for art history precisely because of its "relatively secure date." Clarke offers an extensive discussion of the cup's iconography of male-male sexual relations in the context of [[Augustus|Augustan]] Rome, [[Arrentine ware]], and Greek influence, but does not use the phrase "Greek love" to describe the Roman reception of Greek motifs and style.</ref>

In his work on [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|Roman homosexuality]], the [[classicist]] Craig A. Williams has emphasized that the Romans themselves did not regard male-male sexual behaviors as foreign, and argues that [[pederasty]] itself was not imported. What was foreign to the Romans was the Greek custom of ''pederasteia'' in which both participants were free citizens. "Those sexual practices that could be represented as somehow 'Greek'," Williams notes, "were primarily those involving freeborn boys openly courted in accordance with the Hellenic traditions of pederasty."<ref>Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 17.</ref> Williams regards the [[slavery in ancient Rome|use of slaves]] as a characteristic that distinguishes Roman pederasty, but asserts that other scholars are in error when they view the Hellenization of Roman culture as having influenced Roman sexual attitudes, though he concedes that the Romans had a concept of "Greek customs which included a homosexual component."<ref>As summarized by Blanshard, "Greek Love," p. 182.</ref> Williams also disagrees with other scholars who take Latin expressions such as ''praegraecari'' ("to Greek it up") as necessarily illustrating the perceived "Greekness" of certain behaviors. Williams treats the phrase "Greek love" itself as a modern misconception,<ref>Craig A. Willliam, "Greek Love at Rome," ''Classical Quarterly'' 45.2 (1995) 517<U+2013>539, preview article for his book ''Roman Homosexuality'' (Oxford University Press, 1999); see also [[Martha Nussbaum]]'s foreword to the revised 2nd edition (2010), especially her reservation about the book's emphasis on disparate power relations without accounting for Roman ideals about "how it was right to treat other people" (p. xiv).</ref> and his purpose is to describe male-male relations in Rome as a reality. "Greek love," or the cultural model of Greek pederasty in ancient Rome, may be distinguished from homosexual practice as a "[[literary topos|topos]] or [[Ludus (ancient Rome)|literary game]]" that "never stops being Greek in the Roman imagination."<ref>Vout, ''Power and Eroticism in Imperial Rome'', p. 67. Vout sees the views of Williams and MacMullen as opposite extremes on the subject (p. 45).</ref>

By contrast, the [[French Renaissance]] essayist [[Montaigne]], whose view of love and friendship was [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[rationalist]], rejected "Greek love" as a model in his essay "De l'amiti<U+00E9>" ("On Friendship"); it did not accord with the social needs of his own time, he wrote, because it involved "a necessary disparity in age and such a difference in the lovers' functions."<ref>''Et cet'autre licence Grecque est justement abhorr<U+00E9>e par nos muers'': Montaigne, "De l'amiti<U+00E9>" (1580), [http://books.google.com/books?id=KMoYEWULo2UC&pg=PA138&dq=Montaigne+%22greek+love%22&hl=en&ei=KrIITq-vBIy-tgeHhq3HDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false 187a and c], as cited and discussed by Zahi Anbra Zalloua, ''Montaigne and the Ethics of Skepticism'' (Rockwood Press, 2005), pp. 86<U+2013>87.</ref> Because Montaigne saw friendship as a relationship between equals in the context of [[political liberty]], this inequality diminished the value of Greek love.<ref>Michael Platt, "Montaigne, Of Friendship, and On Tyranny," in ''Freedom over Servitude: Montaigne, La Bo<U+00E9>tie, and "On Voluntary Servitude"'' (Greenwood, 1998), p. 58; special emphasis on the context of political liberty in Marc D.

Platt, "Montaigne," p. 58, thinks that Montaigne's emphasis on equality is more important than the rejection of "bodily love between males" in the passage. Montaigne also regards women as incapable of true friendship.</ref> Although the wholesale importation of a Greek model would be socially improper, ''licence grecque'' seems to refer only to licentious homosexual conduct, in contrast to the moderate behavior between men in the perfect friendship. When Montaigne chooses to introduce his essay on friendship with recourse to the Greek model, "homosexuality's role as [[trope]] is more important than its status as actual male-male desire or act <U+2026> ''licence grecque'' becomes an aesthetic device to frame the center."<ref>Todd W.

===German Hellenism===
The work of the German [[art historian]] [[Johann Winckelmann]] was a major influence on the formation of classical ideals in the 18th century, and is also a frequent starting point for histories of gay German literature.<ref>Robert Tobin, "German Literature," in ''Gay Histories and Cultures: An Encyclopedia'' (Taylor & Francis, 2000), p. 612.</ref> Winckelmann observed the inherent homoeroticism of [[ancient Greek art|Greek art]], though he felt he had to leave much of this perception implicit: "I should have been able to say more if I had written for the Greeks, and not in a modern tongue, which imposed on me certain restrictions."<ref>Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'', pp. 87<U+2013>88, citing ''Winckelmann: Writings on Art'' ed. David Irwin (London: Phaidon, 1972), pp. 105<U+2013>106.</ref> His own homosexuality influenced his response to Greek art and often tended toward the rhapsodic: "from admiration I pass to ecstasy <U+2026>," he wrote of the [[Apollo Belvedere]],<ref>Entry on "Apollo Belvedere," in ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. 55<U+2013>56.</ref> "I am transported to [[Delos]] and the [[sacred grove]]s of [[Lycia]]<U+2014>places [[Apollo]] honoured with his presence<U+2014>and the statue seems to come alive like the beautiful creation of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]."<ref>Winckelmann, as quoted by William Armstrong Percy III, "Reconsiderations about Greek Homosexualities," in ''Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition'', (Haworth Press, 2005), p. 49, with reference to Aldrich, ''The Seduction of the Mediterranean'', p. 51.</ref> Although now regarded as "a historical and utopian," his approach to art history provided a "body" and "set of [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s" for Greek love, "a [[semantics]] surrounding Greek love that <U+2026> feeds into the related eighteenth-century discourses on friendship and love."<ref>Alice A.

Winckelmann inspired [[German poetry|German poets]] in the latter 18th and throughout the 19th century,<ref>Aldrich, ''The Seduction of the Mediterranean'', p. 55.</ref> including [[Goethe]], who pointed to Winckelmann's glorification of the nude male youth in [[ancient Greek sculpture]] as central to a new aesthetics of the time,<ref name="TobinGerman">Tobin, "German Literature," in ''Gay Histories and Cultures'', p. 612.</ref> and for whom Winckelmann himself was a model of Greek love as a superior form of friendship.<ref>W.

==English Romanticism==
The concept of Greek love was important to two of the most significant [[Romantic poetry|poets]] of English [[Romanticism]], [[Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]. The [[British Regency|Regency in England was an era]] characterized by hostility and a "frenzy of <U+2026> persecutions" against homosexuals, the most virulent decades of which coincided with Byron's lifetime.<ref>Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'', p. 3, as evidenced by readings in "poets and novelists, theologians, journal writers, and historians, along with newspapers, political speeches, reports of religious societies, and popular pamphlets."</ref> The terms "homosexual" and "[[gay]]" were not used during this period, but "Greek love" among Byron's contemporaries became a way to conceptualize homosexuality, otherwise taboo, within the precedents of a highly esteemed classical past. The philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]], for instance, appealed to social models of classical antiquity, such as the homoerotic bonds of the [[Theban Band]] and pederasty, to demonstrate how these relationships did not inherently erode heterosexual marriage or the family structure.<ref>Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'', pp. 38<U+2013>53, especially pp. 49<U+2013>51.</ref>

The high regard for classical antiquity in the 18th century caused some adjustment in [[homophobia|homophobic]] attitudes on [[Continental Europe|the Continent]], but not in England.<ref name="CromptonByron">Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'', p.86.</ref> In Germany, the prestige of [[classical philology]] led eventually to more honest translations and essays that examined the homoeroticism of Greek culture, particularly pederasty, in the context of scholarly inquiry rather than moral condemnation. Religious and nationalist sentiments in England overall remained hostile.<ref name="CromptonByron" /> An English archbishop, however, penned what may be the most effusive account of Greek pederasty available in English at the time, duly noted by Byron on the "List of Historical Writers Whose Works I Have Perused" that he drew up at age 19.<ref>Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'', pp. 97<U+2013>97. In his ''Antiquities of Greece'' (1697<U+2013>99), [[John Potter (bishop)|Archbishop John Potter]] assumed that "the excellent passion" of the [[Theban Band]] was chaste. Potter echoes [[Athenaeus]]'s praise of pederasty, and [[Strabo]]'s account of [[Cretan pederasty]].</ref>

[[File:Byron in Greek costume.jpg|thumb|200px|Byron in Greek nationalist costume (''ca.'' 1830) with the [[Acropolis of Athens]] in the background]]
Plato was little read in Byron's time, in contrast to the later [[Victorian era]] when translations of the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' and ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' would have been the most likely way for a young student to learn about Greek sexuality.<ref>Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'', p. 89.</ref> The one English translation of the ''Symposium'', published in two parts in 1761 and 1767, was an ambitious undertaking by the scholar [[Floyer Sydenham]], who nevertheless was at pains to suppress its homoeroticism: Sydenham regularly translated the word ''[[eromenos]]'' as "mistress," and "boy" often becomes "maiden" or "woman."<ref>Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'', pp. 89<U+2013>90.</ref> At the same time, the classical curriculum in English schools passed over works of history and philosophy in favor of  Latin and Greek poetry that often dealt with erotic themes.<ref>Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'', p. 91.</ref> Byron gives a catalogue in his poem ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'':

:[[Ovid]]'s a rake, as half his verses show him,
::[[Anacreon]]'s morals are a still worse sample,
:[[Catullus]] scarcely has a decent poem,
::I don't think [[Sappho]]'s Ode a good example,
:Although [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]] tells us there is no hymn
::Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample;
:But [[Virgil]]'s songs are pure, except that horrid one
:Beginning with ''Formosum Pastor Corydon''.<ref>''Don Juan'', Canto I, as quoted by Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'', p. 92, from ''Byron's "Don Juan": A Variorum Edition'' ed. Truman Guy Steffan and Willis W. Pratt (University of Texas Press, 1971), 2nd ed., 2:45.</ref>

"That horrid one" by Virgil is [[Eclogues|Eclogue 2]], a bucolic expression of frank homoerotic yearning. In describing homoerotic aspects of Byron's life and work, Louis Crompton uses the umbrella term "Greek love" to cover literary and cultural models of homosexuality from classical antiquity as a whole, both Greek and Roman,<ref>Latin literature in particular was seen as continuing or deriving from a Greek heritage.</ref> as received by intellectuals, artists, and moralists of the time. To those such as Byron who were steeped in classical literature, the phrase "Greek love" evoked pederastic myths such as [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]] and [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinthus]], as well as historical figures such as the political martyrs [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton]], and [[Hadrian]]'s beloved [[Antinous]]; Byron refers to all these stories in his writings. He was even more intimate with the classical tradition of male love in Latin literature, and quoted or translated homoerotic passages from Catullus, [[Horace]], Virgil, and [[Petronius]],<ref name="CromptonByron_a">Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'', p. 11.</ref> whose name "was a byword for homosexuality in the eighteenth century."<ref>Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'', p. 93.</ref> In Byron's circle at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], "Horatian" was a code word for "[[bisexual]]."<ref name="CromptonByron_a" /> Byron's library in England included Latin editions of [[Xenophon]], [[Athenaeus]], Catullus, Virgil, Horace, [[Tibullus]], [[Propertius]], Petronius, and [[Martial]], and English translations of Anacreon, [[Herodotus]], [[Lucretius]], [[Juvenal]], and [[Tacitus]], all of whose works contain passages referring to the homosexual practices of their time.<ref>Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'', p. 93, surveying some of the references and attitudes of each. Crompton presumably means a Latin translation of the Greek military commander and writer Xenophon, but fails to make this distinction.</ref>

Byron's "Ode 3" was an imitation of Anacreon, in the playful mode of erotic verse directed in antiquity at both women and boys.<ref>Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'', pp. 95<U+2013>96.</ref> In his youth, Byron was also drawn to heroic love between men, particularly Vergil's account of the tragic bond between [[Nisus and Euryalus]] in Book 9 of the ''[[Aeneid]]'', which Byron paraphrased in ''Hours of Idleness''.<ref>Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'', pp. 97<U+2013>98. Bentham also used the passage to refute the view, as expressed by [[Montesquieu]], that pederasty made men effeminate.</ref> Crompton connects Byron's interest in the Nisus and Euryalus narrative to a real-life relationship between the poet, as an aristocratic patron, and John Edlestone, a young man from a humble background who was two years Byron's junior.<ref>Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'', p. 98ff.</ref>

In one of Byron's adaptations of a classical poem on the love of boys, he omits Catullus's addressee, the youth Juventius, and titled the poem "To Ellen":

==Victorian era==
Throughout the 19th century, upper-class men of same-sex orientation or sympathies regarded "Greek love", often used as a euphemism for the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|ancient pederastic relationship]] between a man and a youth, as a "legitimating ideal":<ref>[[Jonathan Ned Katz]], ''Love Stories: Sex between Men before Homosexuality'' (University of Chicago Press, 2001), p. 244.</ref> "the prestige of Greece among educated middle-class [[Victorians]] <U+2026> was so massive that invocations of [[Hellenism]] could cast a veil of respectability over even a hitherto unmentionable vice or crime."<ref>Linda Dowling, ''Hellenism and Homosexuality in Victorian Oxford'' (Cornell University Press, 1994), p. 28.</ref> Homosexuality emerged as a category of thought during the [[Victorian era]] in relation to [[classical studies]] and "manly" [[nationalism]]; the discourse of Greek love during this time generally excluded women's sexuality.<ref>Nancy Sorkin Rabinowitz, introduction to ''Among Women: From the Homosocial to the Homoerotic in the Ancient World'' (University of Texas Press, 2002), pp. 9<U+2013>10; Joan DeJean, "Sex and Philology: Sappho and the Rise of German Nationalism," in ''Re-reading Sappho: Reception and Transmission'' (University of California Press, 1996), p. 139ff. Deborah Cohler, ''Citizen, Invert, Queer: Lesbianism and War in Early Twentieth-Century Britain'' (University of Minnesota Press, 2010), p. 8, observes that "homosexuality in women was located only through medical or anthropological measure, reserving the 'highly regarded' classical studies for the realm of men only."</ref> Late Victorian writers such as [[Walter Pater]], [[Oscar Wilde]], and [[John Addington Symonds]] saw in "Greek love" a way to introduce individuality and diversity within their own civilization.<ref>Dowling, ''Hellenism and Homosexuality'', p. 66.</ref> Pater's short story "Apollo in Picardy" is set at a fictional monastery where a pagan stranger named Apollyon causes the death of the young novice Hyacinth; it has been observed that the monastery "maps Greek love" as the site of a potential "homoerotic community" within [[Anglo-Catholicism]].<ref>Frederick S.

The efforts among aesthetes and intellectuals to legitimate various forms of homosexual behaviors and attitudes by virtue of a Hellenic model were not without opposition. The 1877 essay "The Greek Spirit in Modern Literature" by Richard St. John Tyrwhitt<ref>Published in ''The Contemporary Review'' 39 (1877), [http://books.google.com/books?id=UbICAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA552&dq=%22greek+spirit+in+modern+literature%22&hl=en&ei=wvgJToe3EbOLsALYkd3SAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22greek%20spirit%20in%20modern%20literature%22&f=false pp. 552<U+2013>566.]</ref> warned against the perceived immorality of this agenda. Tyrwhitt, who was a vigorous supporter of [[Ancient Greek grammar|studying Greek]], characterized the Hellenism of his day as "the total denial of any moral restraint on any human impulses," and outlined what he saw as the proper scope of Greek influence on the education of young men.<ref>Tyrwhitt, "The Greek Spirit in Modern Literature," pp. 558<U+2013>559.</ref>  Tyrwhitt and other critics attacked by name several scholars and writers who had tried to use Plato to support an early gay-rights agenda and whose careers were subsequently damaged by their association with "Greek love."<ref>Blanshard, "Greek Love," p. 145; Dowling, ''Hellenism and Homosexuality'', pp. 90<U+2013>92, 112.</ref>

===Symonds and Greek ethics===
[[File:Symonds, John Addington.jpg|thumb|left|John Addington Symonds, in a photo he signed for Walt Whitman]]
In 1873, the poet and literary critic [[John Addington Symonds]] wrote ''A Problem in Greek Ethics'', a work of what could later be called "[[gay history]]," inspired by the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]].<ref>Katz, ''Love Stories'', p. 244. Katz notes that "Whitman's knowledge of and response to ancient Greek love is the subject for a major study" (p. 381, note 6).</ref> The work, "perhaps the most exhaustive eulogy of Greek love,"<ref name="DeJeanSex">DeJean, "Sex and Philology," p. 139.</ref> remained unpublished for a decade, and then was printed at first only in a limited edition for private distribution.<ref>Katz, ''Love Stories'', p. 244. ''A Problem in Greek Ethics'' was later published without attribution in [[Havelock Ellis]]'s ''Sexual Inversion'' (1897); see Eric O. Clarke, ''Virtuous Vice: Homoeroticism and the Public Sphere'' (Duke University Press, 2000), p. 144.</ref> Although the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits the medical writer [[Charles Gilbert Chaddock|C.G. Chaddock]] for introducing "homosexual" into the English language in 1892, Symonds had already used the word in ''A Problem in Greek Ethics''.<ref>DeJean, "Sex and Philology," p. 132, pointing to the phrase [http://books.google.com/books?id=FJETAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA2&dq=%22homosexual+relations%22+inauthor:symonds&hl=en&ei=iWkHTo-FM5K4twf05oHbDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22homosexual%20relations%22%20inauthor%3Asymonds&f=false "homosexual relations"] (here as it appears in the later 1908 edition).</ref> Symonds's approach throughout most of the essay is primarily [[classical philology|philological]]. He treats "Greek love" as central to Greek "esthetic morality."<ref name="DeJeanSex" /> Aware of the taboo nature of his subject matter, Symonds referred obliquely to pederasty as "that unmentionable custom" in a letter to a prospective reader of the book,<ref>Katz, ''Love Stories'', p. 262.</ref> but defined "Greek love" in the essay itself as "a passionate and enthusiastic attachment subsisting between man and youth, recognised by society and protected by opinion, which, though it was not free from sensuality, did not degenerate into mere licentiousness."<ref>As quoted by Pulham, ''Art and Transitional Object'', p. 59, and Anne Hermann, ''Queering the Moderns: Poses/Portraits/Performances'' (St. Martin's Press, 2000), p. 148.</ref>

Symonds studied classics under [[Benjamin Jowett]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], and later worked with Jowett on an English translation of Plato's ''Symposium''.<ref>[[Robert Aldrich (historian)|Robert Aldrich]], ''The Seduction of the Mediterranean: Writing, Art, and Homosexual Fantasy'' (Routledge, 1993), p. 78.</ref> When Jowett was critical of Symonds' opinions on sexuality,<ref>Dowling, ''Hellenism and Homosexuality'', p. 74, notes that Jowett, in his lectures and introductions, discussed love between men and women when Plato himself had been talking about the Greek love for boys.</ref> Symonds asserted that "Greek love was for Plato no 'figure of speech,' but a present and poignant reality. Greek love is for modern studies of Plato no 'figure of speech' and no anachronism, but a present poignant reality."<ref>Aldrich, ''The Seduction of the Mediterranean'', p. 78, citing a letter written by Symonds. Passage discussed also by Dowling, ''Hellenism and Homosexuality'', p. 130 and Bart Schultz, ''Henry Sidgwick: An Intellectual Biography'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 381.</ref> Symonds struggled against the desexualization of "[[Platonic love]]," and sought to debunk the association of effeminacy with homosexuality by advocating a [[Spartan]]-inspired view of male love as contributing to military and political bonds.<ref>Dowling, ''Hellenism and Homosexuality'', p. 130.</ref> When Symonds was falsely accused of corrupting choirboys, Jowett supported him, despite his own equivocal views of the relation of Hellenism to contemporary legal and social issues that affected homosexuals.<ref>Dowling, ''Hellenism and Homosexuality'', pp. 88, 91.</ref>

Symonds also translated classical poetry on homoerotic themes, and wrote poems drawing on ancient Greek imagery and language such as ''Eudiades'', which has been called "the most famous of his homoerotic poems": "The metaphors are Greek, the tone [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadian]] and the emotions a bit sentimental for present-day readers."<ref>Aldrich, ''The Seduction of the Mediterranean'', p. 78.</ref>

One of the ways in which Symonds and Whitman expressed themselves in their correspondence on the subject of homosexuality was through references to ancient Greek culture, such as the intimate friendship between [[Callicrates  of Sparta|Callicrates]], "the most beautiful man among the Spartans," and the soldier [[Aristodemus of Sparta|Aristodemus]].<ref>Katz, ''Love Stories'', pp. 243<U+2013>244.</ref> Symonds was influenced by [[Karl Otfried M<U+00FC>ller]]'s work on the [[Dorians]], which included an "unembarrassed" examination of the place of [[Pederasty in ancient Greece#Sparta|pederasty in Spartan pedagogy, military life, and society]].<ref>Dowling, ''Hellenism and Homosexuality'', p. xv.</ref> Symonds distinguished between "heroic love," for which the ideal friendship of [[Achilles and Patroclus]] served as a model, and "Greek love," which combined social ideals with "vulgar" reality.<ref name="DeJeanSex" /> Symonds envisioned a "nationalist homosexuality" based on the model of Greek love, distanced from effeminacy and "debasing" behaviors and viewed as "in its origin and essence, military."<ref>Cohler, ''Citizen, Invert, Queer'', p. 7, quoting Symonds, ''A Problem in Sexual Ethics''. See also Douglass Shand-Tucci, ''The Crimson Letter: Harvard, Homosexuality, and the Shaping of American Culture'' (St. Martin's Press, 2003), p. 40.</ref> He tried to reconcile his presentation of Greek love with [[Christian values|Christian]] and [[chivalry|chivalrous values]].<ref>Aldrich, ''The Seduction of the Mediterranean'', p. 80.</ref> His strategy for influencing social acceptance of homosexuality and legal reform in England included evoking an idealized Greek model that reflected [[Victorian morality|Victorian moral values]] such as honor, devotion, and self-sacrifice.<ref>Aldrich, ''The Seduction of the Mediterranean'', p. 83. See also Sarah Cole, ''Modernism, Male Friendship, and the First World War'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 44, on Greek homoeroticism as conceived in Symonds's time as "a form of love which in practice can never match the ideal as presented by the poets." Pulham, ''Art and Transitional Object'', pp. 59ff., points out that despite attempts to "sanitize" Greek love, the Victorian use of classical mythology and texts necessarily admit the "unruly qualities" of sexual desire that the originals contain.</ref>

The trial of Oscar Wilde marked the end of the period when proponents of "Greek love" could hope to legitimate homosexuality by appeals to a classical model.<ref>Blanshard, "Greek Love," pp. 159<U+2013>160.</ref>

==20th and 21st centuries==
In his essay "Greek Love," Alastair Blanshard asserts that "Contrasting attitudes toward Greek love is one of the defining and divisive issues in the [[LGBT social movements|homosexual rights movement]]."<ref name="BlanshardGreek">Blanshard, "Greek Love," p. 161.</ref> The legacy of Greece in homosexual aesthetics became problematic, and the meaning of a "costume" derived from classical antiquity was questioned.<ref name="BlanshardGreek" /> The French theorist [[Michel Foucault]] (1926<U+2013>1984), perhaps best known for his monumental work ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', rejected [[essentialist]] conceptions of gay history, and fostered a now "widely accepted" view that "Greek love is not a prefiguration of modern homosexuality."<ref>Didier Eriobon, ''Insult and the Making of the Gay Self'', translated by Michael Lucey (Duke University Press, 2004), p. xxxiv.</ref>
