'''''Idlewild South''''' is the second [[studio album]] by American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[the Allman Brothers Band]]. [[Record producer|Produced]] by [[Tom Dowd]], the album was released on September 23, 1970, in the United States by [[Atco Records]] and [[Capricorn Records]].

Following the release of [[The Allman Brothers Band (album)|their 1969 debut]], the Allman Brothers Band toured the United States extensively to promote the album, which had little commercial success. Their performances, however, did create positive word of mouth coverage that extended to more famous musicians, such as [[Eric Clapton]], who called upon group leader [[Duane Allman]] to contribute to his 1970 album ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]''.

Due mostly to the band's relentless touring schedule, ''Idlewild South'' was recorded gradually over a period of five months in various cities, including [[New York City|New York]], [[Miami]], and [[Macon, Georgia]], the band's home. [[Tom Dowd]] had previously been arranged to record the group's debut but was unavailable. The material presented on ''Idlewild South'' was written during this period and tested out on the road at shows. The album's title comes from the band's nickname for a ramshackle, remote cabin the band rented out and used for rehearsals, as well as wild parties. ''Idlewild South'' contains two of the band's best-known songs, "[[Midnight Rider]]" (later a hit for various artists) and "[[In Memory of Elizabeth Reed]]", which became one of the band's famous concert numbers.

The album was released in September 1970 but again failed to achieve significant success. Sales began to grow, however, due to the band's touring schedule (they played over 300 shows in 1970), setting the stage for their artistic and commercial breakthrough with their follow-up, 1971's [[live album]] ''[[At Fillmore East]]''.

==Background==
By August 1969, the Allman Brothers Band had recorded their first album, and ''[[The Allman Brothers Band (album)|The Allman Brothers Band]]'' was released that November through [[Atco Records|Atco]] and [[Capricorn Records]].{{sfn|Freeman|1996|p=59}} The record received a poor commercial response, selling less than 35,000 copies upon initial release.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=64}} Executives suggested to the band's manager, [[Phil Walden]], that he relocate the band to [[New York City|New York]] or [[Los Angeles]] to accustom them to the industry. "They wanted us to act "like a rock band" and we just told them to fuck themselves," remembered Trucks.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=65}} For their part, the members of the band remained optimistic, electing to stay in the South. "Everyone told us we'd fall by the wayside down there," said Gregg Allman,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=65}} but the collaboration between the band and Capricorn Records "transformed Macon from this sleepy little town into a very hip, wild, and crazy place filled with bikers and rockers."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=66}} In March 1970, Oakley's wife rented a large Victorian home on 2321 Vineville Avenue in Macon, which they dubbed "the Big House".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=71}}

''Idlewild South'' would be the band's first effort with producer [[Tom Dowd]], known for his work with artists such as [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[John Coltrane]]. Dowd first heard the band rehearsing while visiting Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon, demanding to know their name and remarking to Walden, "Get them the hell out of there and give them to me in the studio. They don't need to rehearse; they're ready to record."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=72}} Dowd was initially scheduled to work with the band on their debut but was called away at the last minute. Initially, the band had asked friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin to produce the album, but as recording inched closer, it became obvious they wanted him to co-produce with Dowd.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=72}} In one of their first sessions, Sandlin was giving suggestions and acting as a co-producer, though no one had informed Dowd; Sandlin was embarrassed and did not return to the studio.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=72}}

The band moved to [[Criteria Studios]] in [[Miami]], where Dowd felt more comfortable producing albums; he viewed the then-new Capricorn as still a work-in-progress and unfit to record in.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=73}} The band was constantly on the road touring in the period in which ''Idlewild South'' was developed, leading to a fractured recording process completed in fits and starts. They reconvened with Dowd during short breaks from shows.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=143}} In addition, group leader [[Duane Allman]] still received invitations to play as a session musician elsewhere; on the "rare instances when [the band] could return to Macon for a short break," Allman would hit the road for New York, Miami or [[Muscle Shoals]] to contribute to other artists' sessions.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=144}} On days in which the band would be available, manager Walden would phone Dowd to inform him; he would often catch their show and spend the rest of the night in the studio.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=143}} After nearly half a year and over three different recording studios, production wrapped up on ''Idlewild South'' by July 1970.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=150}}

Instead of using the recording techniques growing in popularity at that time, such as the advent of multitrack recording, the Allman Brothers Band opted to cut most of ''Idlewild South'' live, with all of the musicians performing together.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=144}} On rare occasions would they go back to overdub sections that weren't up to standard. "The idea is that part of the thing of the Allman Brothers is the spontaneity <U+2014> the elasticity. The parts and tempos vary in a way that only they are sensitive to," said Dowd.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=144}} Duane would often make the decision to leave a song alone for more work and testing out on the road.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=143}} "They would record maybe five songs. Then they might say, 'I don't think that song was good enough,' or, 'I don't think that song was ready to record,'" remembered Dowd.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=143}} [[Joel Dorn]], predominantly a [[jazz]] producer for [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], stepped in to produce one song on the album, "Please Come Home". (More songs were recorded, but only "Please Come Home" was released).{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=147}}  The band were in New York at the time and Dowd was unavailable.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=148}}

Following the recording process, Duane was invited to join [[Eric Clapton]] and his new group [[Derek & the Dominos]] on the recording of their debut album, ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'', with the band.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=82}} Clapton invited Allman to formally join the group, but he reluctantly declined, feeling as though his time was better spent with the Allman Brothers.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=89}}

"Revival" initially took shape as an [[instrumental]], and lyrics were an afterthought.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=73}} "An instrumental has to be real catchy and when you succeed it's very satisfying because you have transcended words and communicated with emotion," said Betts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=73}} The song takes on a decidedly [[gospel music|gospel]] flair midway through, accentuated by "old-fashioned church-like hand clapping."{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=151}} The Allman-penned "Don't Keep Me Wonderin'" follows, featuring Duane on [[slide guitar]] and Oakley's friend [[Thom Doucette]] on [[harmonica]].{{sfn|Freeman|1996|p=72}} "Midnight Rider" developed quickly and featured lyrics written by [[roadie]] Robert Payne, who threw out the suggestion while getting socializing with Allman at their equipment warehouse.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=74}} Unable to gain a key to the nearby Capricorn Sound Studios, the duo broke in and recorded a quick demo with Twiggs Lyndon on [[bass guitar|bass]] and Johnson on [[congas]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=74}} Duane eventually laid down [[acoustic guitar]] tracks for both "Revival" and "Midnight Rider", as he was quicker to record and more technically savvy due to his session work in Muscle Shoals.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=79}}

"[[In Memory of Elizabeth Reed]]" was inspired by a woman Betts was involved with in [[Macon, Georgia|Rose Hill]], who was [[Boz Scaggs]]'s girlfriend.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=73}} "She was [[Hispanic]] and somewhat dark and mysterious<U+2014>and she really used it to her advantage and played it to the hilt," said Betts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=73}} The song is named after a headstone Betts saw at the [[Rose Hill Cemetery (Georgia)|Rose Hill Cemetery]], a place frequented by band members in their early days to relax and write songs.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=73}} Considerable legend developed about what Betts was doing at the time, some originated by a possibly put-on interview [[Duane Allman]] gave ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Patterson | first=R.

==Title==
[[Image:Idlewild Allman Cabin.jpg|thumb|200px|The album's title came from a nickname of a rented cabin the band shared, the "Idlewild South".]]
The album's title came from the band's nickname for a $165-a-month farmhouse it rented on a lake outside of Macon during the recording, the busy comings and goings at which reminded them of [[New York City]]'s [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Idlewild Airport]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}} Idlewild South was the home of rehearsals and parties, and was "where the brotherhood came to pass," according to roadie Robert Payne; "There was a pact made out there around a campfire<U+2014>all for one and one for all.&nbsp;... Everybody believed [in the band] 100 percent."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}} Much of the material presented on the album originated at the cabin.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}}

Scott Boyer spoke on the cabin's history in the 2008 book ''Skydog: The Duane Allman Story'':
<blockquote>
It was like a hunting cabin. The back of the house had a porch that was built out over a manmade lake that was maybe five or six acres. It was a cabin made out of old pinewood, and it had been there for a long time.&nbsp;... The Allman Brothers used it as a rehearsal facility <U+2014> that and a place to go maybe to consume a little something that wasn't quite legal. There were parties out there."{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=154}} 
</blockquote>

==Release and reception==
''Idlewild South'' was issued by [[Atco Records|Atco]] and [[Capricorn Records]] on September 23, 1970, less than a year after their debut.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}} The album sold only "marginally better than its predecessor, though the band had a growing national reputation and the album included songs that would become staples of the band's repertoire<U+2014>and eventually of rock radio."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=94}} While the album did help boost the band's popularity, the Allman Brothers' name really grew in fame due to their live performances.{{sfn|Freeman|1996|p=74}} Walden doubted the band's future, worrying whether they would ever catch on, but word of mouth spread due to the band's relentless touring schedule, and crowds got larger.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=94}}

''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'s}} Ed Leimbacher wrote that ''Idlewild South'' "augurs well for the Allmans' future," calling it "a big step forward from the Allmans' first" but considering the second side of the LP a disappointment.<ref name=rs>{{cite journal|author=Ed Leimbacher| date =December 24, 1970| title =Reviews: ''Idlewild South'' and ''Layla''| journal =[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]| volume = | issue =73 | page =51 | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/idlewild-south-19701224|publisher =[[Straight Arrow Press|Straight Arrow Publishers, Inc.]]| location =[[New York City]] | issn =0035-791X | accessdate =March 24, 2014}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] at ''[[The Village Voice]]'' gave the album a "B+" and considered it a companion piece to Duane Allman's work on ''Layla'', noting that "a lot of people think that Duane Allman is already a ranking titan of the electric guitar."<ref name="Christgau">{{cite journal|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg16.php|title=Consumer Guide (16)|journal=[[The Village Voice]]|date=March 11, 1971|accessdate=September 24, 2011}}</ref> A retrospective five-star review from Bruce Eder at [[Allmusic]] deemed it "the best studio album in the group's history, electric blues with an acoustic texture, virtuoso lead, slide, and organ playing, and a killer selection of songs."<ref name="am">{{cite web|author=Bruce Eder|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/idlewild-south-mw0000196446|title=Review: ''Idlewild South''|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|date=|accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref>
