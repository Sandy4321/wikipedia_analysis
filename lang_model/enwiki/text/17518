'''HMCS ''Sherbrooke''''' was a {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette}} that served with the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. She served primarily in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] as an ocean escort. She is named for [[Sherbrooke, Quebec]].

==Background==
{{main|Flower-class corvette}}
Flower-class corvettes like ''Sherbrooke'' serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ossian |first=Robert |url=http://www.thepirateking.com/ships/ship_types.htm |title=Complete List of Sailing Vessels |website=The Pirate King |accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Fitzsimons |editor-first=Bernard |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons & Warfare |location=London |publisher=Phoebus |date=1978 |volume=11 |pages=1137<U+2013>1142 |isbn=}}</ref><ref name=Jane>{{cite book |title=Jane's Fighting Ships of World War II |location=New Jersey |publisher=Random House |date=1996 |isbn=0-517-67963-9 |page=68}}</ref> The "corvette" designation was created by the French for classes of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877.<ref>{{cite book |last=Blake |first=Nicholas |last2=Lawrence |first2=Richard |title=The Illustrated Companion to Nelson's Navy |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I59v6rkg8egC&pg=PA39 |publisher=Stackpole Books |date=2005 |pages=39<U+2013>63 |isbn=0-8117-3275-4}}</ref> During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, [[Winston Churchill]] reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a [[whaling ship]] design.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chesneau |first=Roger |last2=Gardiner |first2=Robert |title=Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships (1922<U+2013>1946) |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bJBMBvyQ83EC&pg=PA62 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |date=June 1980 |page=62 |isbn=0-87021-913-8}}</ref> The generic name "flower" was used to designate the class of these ships, which <U+2013> in the Royal Navy <U+2013> were named after flowering plants.<ref name=Milner>{{cite book |title=North Atlantic Run |last=Milner |first=Marc |publisher=Naval Institute Press |year=1985 |pages=117<U+2013>119, 142<U+2013>145, 158, 175<U+2013>176, 226, 235, 285<U+2013>291 |isbn=0-87021-450-0}}</ref>

Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral [[Percy W. Nelles]]. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas.<ref name=Macpherson2>{{cite book |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |last2=Milner |first2=Marc |year=1993 |title=Corvettes of the Royal Canadian Navy 1939<U+2013>1945|publisher=Vanwell Publishing |location=St. Catherines |pages=117|isbn=1-55125-052-7}}</ref>

==Construction==
''Sherbrooke'' was ordered 22 January 1940 as part of the 1939<U+2013>1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid down 5 August 1940 by [[Marine Industries|Marine Industries Ltd.]] at [[Sorel, Quebec]] and launched 25 October 1940.<ref name=uboat>{{cite web | url = http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/842.html | work = Uboat.net | title = HMCS ''Sherbrooke'' (K 152) | accessdate = 24 August 2013}}</ref> She was commissioned 5 June 1941 at Sorel.<ref name=Macpherson>{{cite book |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |year=1981 |title=The ships of Canada's naval forces 1910<U+2013>1981 : a complete pictorial history of Canadian warships |publisher=Collins |location=Toronto|pages=85, 231<U+2013>232 |isbn=0-00216-856-1}}</ref>

During her career, ''Sherbrooke'' underwent two significant refits. The first took place at [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia]] from April to June 1943. The second major overhaul took place at [[Liverpool, Nova Scotia]] beginning in May 1944 and lasting until 22 August 1944. During this second refit, ''Sherbrooke'' had her [[fo'c'sle]] extended. She needed a further month of repairs at Halifax after completing the refit.<ref name=Macpherson/><ref name=uboat/>

==War service==
After arriving at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] for deployment, she was initially assigned to Halifax Force as a local escort. In September 1941 she transferred to Newfoundland Command and escorted her first convoy from [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] to [[Iceland]] at the end of that month. She would continue to escort these convoys until January 1942 when the European destination changed to [[Derry]] and she became a member of the [[Mid-Ocean Escort Force]] (MOEF).<ref name=Macpherson/>

She served mainly with MOEF escort group C-4. In February 1942 ''Sherbrooke'' picked up 15 survivors from the Greek merchant ''Meropi'' that had been torpedoed and sunk off Halifax.<ref name=uboat/> As a member of C-4 she took part in the major convoy battles for convoy [[Convoy ON 127|ON 127]] in August 1942 and [[Convoy HX 229|HX 229]] in March 1943.<ref name=Macpherson/> On 10 September 1942 she picked up 39 survivors from the Norwegian tanker ''Sveve'' that had been torpedoed and sunk in the North Atlantic.<ref name=uboat/>

After returning from her first major refit, ''Sherbrooke'' joined the [[Western Local Escort Force]] (WLEF) which escorted convoys along the North American coast. As a member of WLEF she was initially assigned to escort group W-2, but transferred to W-7 in April 1944. After returning from her second major refit, she rejoined WLEF and was made part of escort group W-1. She remained with this group until the end of the war.<ref name=Macpherson/>

==Post-war service==
''Sherbrooke'' was [[paid off]] at Sorel on 28 June 1945. She was sold for scrapping and broken up at [[Hamilton, Ontario]] in 1947.<ref name=lenton/><ref name=Macpherson/>
