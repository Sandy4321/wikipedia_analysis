'''Hyderabad''' {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|h|a<U+026A>|d|<U+0259>r|<U+0259>|b|ae|d |audio=Hyderabad.ogg}} is the capital and largest city of the southern [[States and territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. Occupying {{Convert|650|km2|sqmi}} on the banks of the [[Musi River (India)|Musi River]], it had a population of 6.8 million in 2011 with a [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] population of 7.75 million, making it India's [[List of most populous cities in India|fourth most populous city]] and [[List of million-plus agglomerations in India|sixth most populous urban agglomeration]].

Established in 1591 [[Common Era|CE]] by [[Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah]], fifth sultan of the Qutb Shahi dynasty of [[Golkonda]], Hyderabad remained under the rule of the Qutb Shahi dynasty until 1687, when Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] conquered the region and the city became part of the [[Mughal empire]]. In 1724, [[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asaf Jah I|Asif Jah I]], a Mughal viceroy, declared his sovereignty and formed the Asif Jahi dynasty, also known as the [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizams of Hyderabad]]. The Nizams ruled the [[Hyderabad state|princely state of Hyderabad]] in a [[subsidiary alliance]] with the [[British Raj]] for more than two centuries. The city remained the capital from 1769 to 1948, when the Nizam signed an [[Instrument of Accession]] with the [[Indian Union]] as a result of [[Operation Polo]]. Between 1948 and 1956, Hyderabad city was the capital of the [[Hyderabad State (1948<U+2013>56)|Hyderabad State]]. In 1956, the [[States Reorganisation Act]] merged the [[Telangana region]] of Hyderabad State with [[Andhra State]] to form the modern state of Andhra Pradesh, with Hyderabad city as its capital.

Historically, Hyderabad was known for its [[Hyderabad Pearls|pearl]] and diamond trading centres. Industrialisation attracted major Indian manufacturing, research and financial institutions, such as [[Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited]], the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]], the [[National Geophysical Research Institute]], the [[Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology]] and the [[National Mineral Development Corporation]]. The formation of an [[information technology]] (IT) [[Special Economic Zone]] (SEZ) by the state agencies attracted global and Indian companies to set up operations in the city. The emergence of [[pharmaceutical]] and [[biotechnology]] industries in the 1990s and the formation of [[Genome Valley]] earned it the title "India's pharmaceutical capital". The [[Telugu film industry]] is based in Hyderabad. [[List of tourist attractions in Hyderabad|Places of interest]] include [[Chowmahalla Palace]], [[Charminar]] and [[Golkonda#The Fort|Golkonda fort]]. Hyderabad has several museums such as [[Salar Jung Museum]], [[Nizam Museum]], and [[AP State Archaeology Museum]] as well as home to bazaars such as [[Laad Bazaar]], [[Madina, Hyderabad|Madina Circle]], [[Begum Bazaar]] and [[Sultan Bazaar]], dating from the Qutb Shahi and Nizam era. ''[[Hyderabadi biriyani]]'' and ''[[Hyderabadi haleem]]'' are examples of the distinctive culinary products of the city.

===Literature===
In the past, Hyderabad had received royal patronage for arts, literature and architecture from Qutb Shahi rulers and Nizams attracting artists and men of letters from different parts of the world. The resulting multi-ethnic settlements popularised cultural events such as ''[[mushaira]]s'' (poetic symposia).<ref name="Int Mushaira">{{cite news|title=Anjuman Muhibban-e-Urdu to hold international mushaira|url=http://www.siasat.com/english/news/anjuman-muhibban-e-urdu-hold-international-mushaira|newspaper=The Siasat Daily|date=13 April 2012|accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref> The Qutb Shahi dynasty particularly encouraged the growth of Deccani Urdu literature leading to works such as the ''[[Deccani Masnavi]]'' and ''[[Diwan (poetry)|Diwan poetry]]'', which are among the earliest available manuscripts in Urdu.<ref name="Masud">{{cite book|title=Mohammad Quli Qutb Shah|publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]]|pages=50<U+2013>77|year=1996|isbn=81-260-0233-6|last=Hussain Khan|first=Masud}}</ref> ''[[Lazzat Un Nisa]]'' a book compiled in the 15th century at Qutb Shahi courts, contains erotic paintings with diagrams for secret medicines and stimulants in the eastern form of ancient sexual acts.<ref name="Lizzat-un-nisa">{{cite book|title=Scent in the Islamic Garden: A Study of Deccani Urdu Literary Sources|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=40|year=2001|isbn=978-0-19-579334-5|first=Ali Alber|last=Husain}}</ref> The reign of the Nizams saw many literary reforms and the introduction of Urdu as a language of court, administration and education.<ref name="Datta">{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian literature: Devraj to Jyoti, Volume 2|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|pages=1260, 1746<U+2013>1748|year=2005|isbn=81-260-1194-7|last=Datta|first=Amaresh}}</ref> In 1824, a collection of Urdu ''[[Ghazal]]'' poetry, named ''Gulzar-e-Mahlaqa'', authored by [[Mah Laqa Bai]]<U+2014>the first female Urdu poet to produce a Diwan<U+2014>was published in Hyderabad.<ref name="Mah laqa bai">{{cite book|title=Women writing in India volume 1, 600 BC to the early twentieth century|publisher=[[The Feminist Press]]| pages=120<U+2013>122|year=1991|isbn=1-55861-027-8|first1=Susie J.|last1=Tharu|first2=K.|last2=Lalita}}</ref>

===Music, performing arts and films===
[[South Indian music]] and dances such as the [[Kuchipudi]] and [[Kathakali]] styles are popular in the Deccan region.
