  }} 

'''''Dancing with the Stars''''' is a [[Logie Award]]-winning, Australian light entertainment [[reality show]] airing on the [[Seven Network]] and filmed live from the [[HSV-7]] studios in [[Melbourne]]. The show is based on the [[United Kingdom]] [[BBC]] [[Television]] series ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' and is part of [[BBC Worldwide]]'s international ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' franchise.

The show debuted in a short run from October to November 2004, then returned the following February. The show has been picked up for a ninth season by Seven and airs on Sundays at 6:30pm.

The show averages around 2 million viewers a week nationally during its peak.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thinktv.com.au/SiteMedia/w3svc371/Uploads/Documents/5e28b79e-2e34-4466-9414-abe544854856.pdf  |title=Free TV Ratings Report <U+2013> Survey 10, 2006 |accessdate=15 November 2008 |date= |publisher=Free TV Australia |format=PDF}}</ref>

The show pairs celebrities with professional [[ballroom dancers]] who each week compete against each other in a dance-off to impress a panel of judges and ultimately the viewing public in order to survive potential elimination. Through a telephone and SMS voting, viewers vote for the duo they think should remain in the competition. Judges' scores are combined with the viewer votes when determining which duo is eliminated.

Sonia Kruger and Daniel MacPherson are the current hosts. Both are expected to return to their hosting duties for Series 10 in 2010.
