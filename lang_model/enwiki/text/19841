'''Bramlage Coliseum''' is a 12,500-seat multi-purpose [[List of indoor arenas|arena]] in [[Manhattan, Kansas]].  The arena's primary function is as home to the men's and women's [[basketball]] teams for [[Kansas State University]].  The building also holds offices for Kansas State [[baseball]], Intercollegiate Athletics, and Sports Information. <ref>http://www.kstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3333&SPID=228&DB_OEM_ID=400&ATCLID=%20676650</ref>

==History==
The arena was built to replace [[Ahearn Field House]], K-State's basketball facility from 1950 to 1988.  Construction of Bramlage Arena began with a groundbreaking on October 18, [[1986]], and was completed in [[1988]].  The construction was funded entirely by student fees and donations from alumni and friends of the University.  The name of the arena honors Fred Bramlage, a local philanthropist instrumental in raising funds for the facility.

On November 26, 1988, Kansas State University officially opened Bramlage Coliseum with an 81-77 victory over [[Purdue]].  The first basketball game actually played in the arena, however, was an exhibition contest between the [[Dallas Mavericks]] and the [[San Antonio Spurs]] on October 21, 1988.

Entering the [[2006-07 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2006-2007 season]], Kansas State's men's basketball team had posted a 203-80 (.717) record in Bramlage Coliseum.   

The facility hosted [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|women's NCAA basketball tournament]] games in [[2002 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|2002]] and [[2003 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|2003]].

===Seating capacity===
Seating capacity in Bramlage was originally 13,500.  Adjustments for fire codes lowered this number to 13,340 in the 1990s, and construction prior to the [[2007-08 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2007-2008 season]] eliminated another approximately 800 seats to add [[luxury box]]es and bring handicap seating up to compliance.<ref>{{Citation | title = K-State Has Grand Plans | newspaper = The Topeka Capital-Journal | date = June 26, 2007 | url = http://cjonline.com/stories/062607/cat_180019837.shtml}}</ref>  The largest basketball crowd in the arena's history was 13,762 for a game against the [[University of Kansas]] on February 22, [[1992]] <U+2013> a record that will remain unbroken barring future expansion of the facility.
