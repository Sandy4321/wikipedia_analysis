'''Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health''' in [[London]] is responsible for the training of [[postgraduate]] doctors in [[paediatrics]] and conducting the '''MRCPCH''' membership exams.  They also conduct the Diploma in Child Health exam, which is taken by many doctors who plan a career in General Practice. Fellows of the college have the postnominal initials '''FRCPCH'''.

The [[United Kingdom]]'s first national group of [[paediatrician]]s was established in 1928 as the [[British Paediatric Association]] or BPA.
Royal College status was granted to the BPA in August 1996. Shortly after this, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health moved to its first home in Hallam Street, [[London]]. On 21 March 2008, the college moved to new premises at 5-11 Theobalds Rd, London, WC1X 8SH, its current home.

== Aims of the College ==
Since the earliest days, the aim of the BPA was the advancement of the study of paediatrics and the promotion of friendship amongst paediatricians. The association in its early days had neither statutory functions nor political influence. The postgraduate training and examination of paediatricians continued to be the responsibility of the [[Royal College of Physicians]], to which most paediatricians also belonged.

The functions and responsibilities of the RCPCH have rapidly expanded since its formation to include the oversight of postgraduate training and examinations. It continues to conduct paediatric research, organise meetings and conferences and to publish papers and guidelines of relevance to paediatric practice.

The College works closely with other bodies that have responsibilities in the same or related areas, including the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)]], the Deaneries, the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board, the [[General Medical Council]], NCAS, [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]], children's charities and the other Medical Royal Colleges.

The College currently has about 11,500 members, who are mainly hospital and community paediatricians. Most members are based in the UK, though there is an increasing number of members and fellows who live overseas.

==Coat of arms==
