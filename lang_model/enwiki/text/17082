'''Oklahoma State Highway 9''', abbreviated as '''OK-9''', '''SH-9''', or simply '''Highway 9''', is a major east-west highway in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Oklahoma]]. Spanning across the central part of the state, SH-9 begins at the [[Texas]] state line near [[Madge, Oklahoma]], and ends at the [[Arkansas]] state line near [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]]. Oklahoma State Highway 9 is a major highway around the [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]] area. At 350 miles<ref name="okhighways">{{okhighways|9|2007-10-11}}</ref> (563.3 km), SH-9 is Oklahoma's second-longest state highway (second to [[State Highway 3 (Oklahoma)|State Highway 3]]).

==Route description==
[[Image:Ok-9 path.svg|thumb|right|Map displaying the path of OK-9 through Oklahoma]]
===West of Interstate 35===
[[Image:Ok9w.jpg|thumb|right|A new OK-9 sign, of the 2006 design, just west of I-35 in Goldsby]]
From the western terminus at [[State Highway 203 (Texas)|State Highway 203]] along the Texas border, the highway travels due east for {{convert|5|mi|km}}<ref name="odot-2007-map">{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Transportation|title=2007 Centennial State Map}}</ref> and intersects with [[State Highway 30 (Oklahoma)|OK-30]] between Madge and [[Vinson, Oklahoma|Vinson]]. OK-9 continues east for {{convert|23|mi|km}}<ref name="odot-2007-map"/> without intersecting another highway until meeting [[U.S. Route 283|U.S. 283]]/[[State Highway 34 (Oklahoma)|OK-34]], which is two miles north of [[Mangum, Oklahoma|Mangum]]. The highway overlaps the other two routes for four miles, going north, before splitting off and heading east again through [[Granite, Oklahoma|Granite]] and [[Lone Wolf, Oklahoma|Lone Wolf]]. Near [[Hobart, Oklahoma|Hobart]], OK-9 overlaps [[United States Highway 183|U.S. 183]] for {{convert|4|mi|km}}<ref name="odot-2007-map"/> (again going northward) before splitting off again.

Continuing east, OK-9 passes through [[Gotebo, Oklahoma|Gotebo]], [[Mountain View, Oklahoma|Mountain View]], and [[Carnegie, Oklahoma|Carnegie]]. Around [[Fort Cobb, Oklahoma]], the highway begins {{convert|9|mi|km}}<ref name="odot-2007-map"/> of travel to the south. There, the route links up with the concurrent U.S. Highways [[U.S. Route 62|62]] and [[U.S. Route 281|281]]. While U.S. 281 will split off in [[Anadarko, Oklahoma|Anadarko]], OK-9 and U.S. 62 remain concurrent until [[Newcastle, Oklahoma|Newcastle]]. In [[Chickasha, Oklahoma|Chickasha]], [[U.S. Route 277|U.S. 277]] joins to form another three-route concurrency with U.S. 62 and OK-9. On the eastern edge of Chickasha, U.S. 62/277/OK-9 have an interchange with [[Interstate 44|I-44]], or more commonly known as the [[H.E. Bailey Turnpike]].

Traveling northeast from Chickasha, U.S. 62/277/OK-9 are routed to the town of [[Blanchard, Oklahoma|Blanchard]]. Four miles later, OK-9 splits away from the two U.S. routes at a [[diamond interchange]] that also serves as the eastern terminus of the H.E. Bailey Turnpike Spur. OK-9 remains without any concurrent routes until [[Goldsby, Oklahoma|Goldsby]]. The section of road east of U.S. 62/277, recently upgraded to a four-lane divided highway, provides a link from the H.E. Bailey Turnpike Spur to [[Interstate 35]]. At the interstate, OK-9 merges onto I-35 northbound to cross the [[Canadian River]] into Norman.

===East of Interstate 35===
[[Image:Ok9east.jpg|thumb|right|OK-9 East exiting from I-35 in Norman]]
Through Norman, Highway 9 serves as a major artery providing access to the [[University of Oklahoma]] campus (in particular, the [[Lloyd Noble Center]]). Around the area, the route is a four-lane divided highway (with surface crossings and stoplights). However, after a full interchange with [[U.S. Route 77|U.S. 77]], the road becomes a two lane highway again.

OK-9 continues eastward, passing [[Lake Thunderbird]] and the Little River Zoo, before reaching the towns of [[Tecumseh, Oklahoma|Tecumseh]] and [[Seminole, Oklahoma|Seminole]]. The road intersects the [[Indian Nation Turnpike]] near [[Hanna, Oklahoma|Hanna]], and [[U.S. Route 69|U.S. 69]] near [[Eufaula, Oklahoma|Eufaula]]. OK-9 provides access to the south side of [[Lake Eufaula]] before reaching [[Stigler, Oklahoma|Stigler]].

OK-9 overlaps [[U.S. Route 59|U.S. 59]] for {{convert|5|mi|km}},<ref name="odot-2007-map"/> after which the road becomes concurrent with [[U.S. Route 271|U.S. 271]]. Both remain concurrent, until the highway ends at the Arkansas border. After passing the Arkansas state line, Oklahoma State Highway 9 becomes [[Interstate 540 (Arkansas)|I-540]], and U.S. 271 continues over the state line concurrent with the Interstate.

==History==
[[Image:Oksh old1 9.svg|thumb|100px|right|Original OK-9 shield]]
Officially designated on [[1924-08-24]]<ref name="odot-history">{{cite web|url=http://www.okladot.state.ok.us/memorial/legal/sh9.htm|author=Oklahoma Department of Transportation|title=Memorial Dedication and Revision History|accessdate=2007-11-04}}</ref>, the original route encompassed all of current OK-9 west of Blanchard. East of Blanchard, OK-9 followed a more northerly route, Bypassing Norman, OK-9 ran north to [[Oklahoma City]] before going east through [[Harrah, Oklahoma|Harrah]], [[Meeker, Oklahoma|Meeker]], [[Prague, Oklahoma|Prague]], [[Henryetta, Oklahoma|Henryetta]], and [[Checotah, Oklahoma|Checotah]]. The highway ended at the original [[Oklahoma State Highway 3 (1924)|State Highway 3]] in [[Spiro, Oklahoma|Spiro]]. Upon the creation of the [[United States Numbered Routes]] system in 1926, the section between Oklahoma City and Warner was overlaid with [[U.S. Route 266]].<ref name="odot-1927-map">{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Highways|title=Oklahoma State Highway System|edition=1927|url=http://www.odot.org/hqdiv/p-r-div/maps/state-maps/pdfs/1927.pdf|accessdate=2007-11-06}}</ref> Four years later in 1930, OK-9 was truncated to Chickasha.<ref name="odot-history"/> By this time, much of the route had become part of [[U.S. Route 62]].<ref name="odot-1931-map">{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Highways|title=Map Showing Condition of Improvement of the State Highway System|edition=1931|url=http://www.odot.org/hqdiv/p-r-div/maps/state-maps/pdfs/1931.pdf|accessdate=2007-11-06}}</ref>

On [[1935-08-27]], the route was extended eastward,<ref name="odot-history"/> taking over the original OK-37.  OK-9's eastern terminus became OK-48 near [[Seminole, Oklahoma|Seminole]].<ref name="odot-1936-map">{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Highways|title=Map Showing Condition of Improvement of the State Highway System and Landing Fields|edition=1936|url=http://www.odot.org/hqdiv/p-r-div/maps/state-maps/pdfs/1936.pdf|accessdate=2007-11-06}}</ref> On [[1937-08-25]], the route was brought further east to end at U.S. 69 in Eufaula.<ref name="odot-history"/> Part of the newly commissioned section was rescinded on [[1937-10-19]],<ref name="odot-history"/> when a small segment just east of OK-48 and the entire [[Hughes County, Oklahoma|Hughes County]] portion were dropped from the highway.<ref name="odot-1938-map">{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Highways|title=Map Showing Condition of Improvement of the State Highway System|edition=1938|url=http://www.odot.org/hqdiv/p-r-div/maps/state-maps/pdfs/1938.pdf|accessdate=2007-11-06}}</ref> These sections were re-added on [[1938-09-27]].<ref name="odot-history"/>

State Highway 9 was extended eastward twice in the route's history. The first extension occurred on [[1941-02-26]],<ref name="odot-history"/> and extended OK-9 to OK-2 at [[Whitefield, Oklahoma|Whitefield]].<ref name="odot-1941-map">{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Highways|title=Map Showing Condition of Improvement of the State Highway System|edition=1941|url=http://www.odot.org/hqdiv/p-r-div/maps/state-maps/pdfs/1941.pdf|accessdate=2007-11-06}}</ref> The final extension brought OK-9 to the Arkansas state line on [[1941-11-12]].<ref name="odot-history"/> The only major realignment in OK-9's history since 1941 was the Norman expressway bypass, which was designated as OK-9 on [[1971-11-08]].<ref name="odot-history"/>

After the [[I-40 bridge disaster]], parts of State Highway 9 in eastern Oklahoma served as an emergency detour for eastbound [[Interstate 40|I-40]] traffic. All eastbound traffic was routed along the section of OK-9 between OK-2 in Whitefield and U.S. 59. In addition, the section of OK-9 between U.S. 59 and the Arkansas state line were used for eastbound traffic for [[truck|commercial truck]]s.<ref name="odot-I40-bridge-detour">{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Transportation|title=I-40 Arkansas River Bridge Detour Routes|url=http://www.odot.org/public-info/i40bridge/agifs/I-40DetourLocall.gif|accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref>

==Spurs==
Oklahoma State Highway 9 creates spur highways. For example:
*'''Business OK-9''' is a three mile loop through [[Hobart, Oklahoma|Hobart]].
* Another instance of '''Business OK-9''' loops through [[Gotebo, Oklahoma|Gotebo]]. (This is not shown on the state highway map.)
[[Image:Oklahoma State Highway 9A.svg|thumb|50px|right|OK-9A shield]]
*'''OK-9A''' is a designation for three distinct highways:
** A highway that intersects OK-9 in [[Earlsboro, Oklahoma|Earlsboro]] and links the parent highway to [[Interstate 40|I-40]] and [[State Highway 39 (Oklahoma)|OK-39]] in [[Konawa, Oklahoma|Konawa]]. The spur also passes through the town of [[Maud, Oklahoma|Maud]].
** A connector highway from U.S. 69 to OK-9 south of Eufaula.
** A spur route to [[State Highway 112 (Oklahoma)|OK-112]] in [[Arkoma, Oklahoma|Arkoma]]. This section is a former alignment of [[U.S. Highway 271]].
