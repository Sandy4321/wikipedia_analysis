'''[[Greece]]''' and '''[[Elliniki Radiophonia Tileorassi|ERT]]''' will choose to do a national selection again for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]] after efforts to find a big name artist for an internal selection failed.  They originally asked [[Elli Kokkinou]] internally, but she denied because of her pregnancy. On [[December 17]], [[2007]], '''[[Elliniki Radiophonia Tileorassi|ERT]]''' officially announced the participates of the national final as [[Kalomoira Saranti]], [[Kostas Martakis]], and [[Chrispa]].<ref>{{ cite web | title = ERT announces the national final participants | url = http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&id=1837}} Oikotimes {{En icon}}</ref><ref>{{ cite web | title = Greece: National final participants announced | url = http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/9908}} ESCToday {{En icon}}</ref> The provisional date for the national final is [[February 26]], [[2008]].  The format looks to stay the same as last year where each artist chooses a song, and then performs it in their own way. The winer will be chosen via 50% Tele-voting/SMS Messaging and 50% internal jury.  The song and participant press conference will be sometime in February.<ref>{{ cite web | title = 3 <U+03B3><U+03B9><U+03B1> <U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03BD> Eurovision | url = http://www.mad.tv/news/?id=27960}} MAD TV {{Gr icon}}</ref>
