'''Varg Vikernes'''<ref>not Varg Qisling Larss<U+00F8>n Vikernes, according to Norwegian Tax Registry</ref> ({{IPA2|varg 'vi:ke<U+0273>es}}) born on 11 February 1973 near [[Bergen]], [[Norway]]) is a [[black metal]] musician, convicted murderer, arsonist and political activist. In 1991 Vikernes conceived the one-man music project [[Burzum]], which quickly became prominent within the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]]. Later he became a prominent organizer for the [[Heathen Front]] and authored several writings on [[Germanic neopaganism]] that were published in "various underground publications".<ref name="GC204">Goodrick-Clarke 2003: 204</ref> In a documentary on heavy metal, he was described as "the most notorious metal musician of all time".<ref>{{cite video |people=Dunn, Sam (Director) |date=5 August 2005 |url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0478209/ |title=Metal: A Headbanger's Journey |medium=motion picture |location=Canada |publisher=Dunn, Sam}}</ref>

==Biography==
Vikernes is currently serving a 21-year sentence for the August 1993 murder of [[Euronymous|<U+00D8>ystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth]] of [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] as well for the burning of three [[churches]] in Norway, also being strongly suspected of the arson of the [[Fantoft stave church]]. He was eligible for parole in spring 2008, after serving 15 years in prison, but his application was denied.<ref>[[Aftenposten]], English edition, 11 June 2008:[http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2477398.ece Too dangerous for parole]</ref>A June 2008 newspaper article mentions that Vikernes is married and has a fifteen-year-old daughter (born 1993) and a son (born 2007).<ref>[[Verdens Gang|VG Nett]], 11 June 2008: [http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=513005 Varg Vikernes for farlig for friheten] {{no icon}}</ref> In an interview made in 2004, Vikernes said that he has a daughter (whom he has seen twice since 1993) and that he had "never been married".<ref name="BZINT">www.burzum.org: [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/interview01.shtml 12 August 2004 interview]</ref>  In a 2008 interview he refers to his two children and to expecting a third.<ref>Rune Midtskogen, "Jeg er klar for samfunnet," ''Dagbladet'' June 6, 2008 http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2008/07/06/540102.html accessed Jan. 21, 2009</ref>

===Background, childhood and adolescence===

There exists no biography of him (authorized or unauthorized), but some information can be gathered from the interviews he has given, especially those printed in ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos]]''. The account of Vikernes' views that is given in ''Lords of Chaos'' needs to be taken with a grain of salt (see the section on it below), but in the interviews printed in the book, he talks a lot about his background and his childhood, and even an interview with his mother, Lene Bore, is included. In the 2004 interview Vikernes mentions that "she is working in a large oil company".<ref name="BZINT"/> He also gives his father's profession as "electronics engineer",<ref name="BZINT"/> whereas his brother, who (according to the ''Lords of Chaos'' interview) is "one and a half years older",<ref name=LoC148/> is a "graduate civil engineer".<ref name="BZINT"/>
  
In the ''Lords of Chaos'' interview, Vikernes recalls an incident from his childhood: When he was about 6 years old, the family moved for about a year to [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]],  because Vikernes' "father was working for [[Saddam Hussein]]",<ref name=LoC147>LoC 1998: 147</ref> developing a computer program. Since there were no places available in the English school in Baghdad, the young Vikernes went to an Iraqi elementary school during this time. According to his interview, Vikernes here became "aware of racial matters".<ref name=LoC148>LoC 1998: 148</ref> [[Corporal punishment]] was not uncommon in the school, and on one occasion Vikernes had a "quarrel" with a teacher and called him "a monkey". But as Vikernes perceived it the teachers "didn't dare to hit me because I was white".<ref name=LoC148 /> Vikernes' mother also recalls how they "spent a year in Iraq", and that "the other children in his class would get slapped by their teachers; he would not."<ref name=LoC142>LoC 1998: 142</ref> She mentions that this created problems, but generally she "has no good explanation of how Varg" developed his views.<ref name=LoC144>LoC 1998: 144</ref> Vikernes reveals slightly more in his interview. When asked about his father, he says that he "had a [[swastika]] flag at home"<ref name=LoC147 /> and that his father was hysterical about it. However, Vikernes feels that his father was a hypocrite, because he was worried about Vikernes "being a Nazi", whereas he too was "pissed about all the colored people he saw in town".<ref name=LoC147 /> About his mother, Vikernes says that she was "very race conscious", in the  sense that she was afraid that Vikernes "was going to come home with a black girl!"<ref name=LoC146>LoC 1998: 146</ref> At the time of the interview (1995), Vikernes still had a positive relationship with his mother, but "very little contact" with his father.<ref name=LoC147 /> His parents are divorced. Vikernes' father is said to have  "left about 10 years ago",<ref name=LoC147 /> which would have been 1985, when Vikernes was 12.

There is some evidence that Vikernes was involved with the skinhead scene in Bergen before he became a part of the black metal scene. Goodrick-Clarke introduces [[Burzum]] as the "musical vehicle" of the "ex-skinhead" Vikernes.<ref name="GC204"/> According to the [[Encyclopedia of White Power]], "Vikernes first became involved with the extreme right as a National Socialist skinhead while he was an adolescent."<ref name="Kapl-319">Kaplan 2000: 319</ref> When he is asked in the interview in ''Lords of Chaos'' whether he hung out with skinheads in Bergen, Vikernes boldly replies: "There were no skinheads in Bergen."<ref name="LoC149"/> He mentions, though, that he had short hair at that time and that he was into weapons, that he liked the Germans and hated the British and Americans.<ref name="LoC149"/>

===Early musical career===

{{Expand-section|date=November 2008}}
{{see|Burzum}}

Vikernes had been learning the guitar since he was 14.<ref name="LoC149">LoC 1998: 149</ref> 

When he was about 17, Vikernes came into contact with the members of the Bergen [[death metal]] band [[Old Funeral]]. He played guitar with them during 1990<U+2013>1991 and performed on their ''Devoured Carcass'' EP.

In 1991, Vikernes began a solo musical project named [[Burzum]], and quickly became involved with the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]]. During 1992<U+2013>1993, he recorded four albums as Burzum that played a key role in the development of [[black metal]].

Vikernes has stated that for the recording of these early albums he used an old Westone guitar, bought in 1987 from an acquaintance.<ref name = "burzummusic">[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story06.shtml A Burzum Story: Part VI - The Music]</ref> He used the cheapest bass guitar there was in the shop and he borrowed drumsets from Old Funeral, Immortal and "another musician living nearby".<ref name = "burzummusic"/> On ''[[Hvis lyset tar oss]]'', he borrowed [[Hellhammer (musician)|Hellhammer]]'s drumset, the same one Hellhammer used to record ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'' by [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]].<ref>[http://www.teufelstomb.com/interviews/mayhem-1999/ Teufels Tomb: Interview with Hellhammer]</ref> He used a [[Peavey]] amplifier, but for the recording of ''[[Filosofem]]'' he used the amplifier on his brother's stereo and some old fuzz pedals.<ref name = "burzummusic"/> For vocals, he would use whatever microphone the sound tech handed him, but during the recording of ''Filosofem'' he intentionally used the worst mic they had, a headset mic.<ref name = "burzummusic"/> On the track "Dungeons of Darkness" he used the large gong at [[Grieghallen]] for background noise ([[Euronymous]] assisted him by beating his fists on it).<ref name = "burzummusic"/>

===Arson of churches===

On 6 June 1992, the [[Fantoft stave church]], one of Norway's architectural treasures dating from the 12th century, was burned to the ground via arson. By January 1993, arson attacks had occurred on at least seven other major [[stave church]]es, including one on [[Christmas Eve]] of 1992.<ref name="GC204"/> Vikernes was found guilty of several of these cases: the attempted arson of Storetveit Church in Bergen and the arson of <U+00C5>sane Church in Bergen, Skjold Church in Vindafjord, and Holmenkollen Chapel in Oslo. He was also charged with the arson of [[Fantoft stave church]], although the jurors voted not guilty. The judges called this an error but did not overthrow the whole case.<ref>[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story02.shtml]</ref>

<!-- IMAGE HAS NO FAIR USE RATIONALE FOR THIS ARTICLE [[Image:Burzum aske.jpg|thumb|right|The charred ruins of the [[Fantoft stave church]] as seen on Burzum's 1992 EP, ''[[Aske (album)|Aske]]''.]] -->
Vikernes was rumored to have been motivated both by [[paganism]] and [[theistic Satanism]], but has denied he was ever a Satanist.<ref>See 1995 [[Morgenbladet]] article "Satanism in Norway", English translation Michael Moynihan, ''Lords of Chaos'', pp. 344-45.</ref> The first case of arson happened on 6 June 1992 and was widely rumored to have been started at 6am, although it is far more likely that the burning commenced earlier in the morning. The speculative 6/6/6 time and date based on the [[Number of the Beast]] has been widely reported. But however sensational it may be, burning a church at 6am would present a high risk of capture.

In an interview with [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]] Vikernes made a statement about the church burnings that hints at a [[Germanic paganism|heathen]] rather than a Satanist motivation:

<blockquote>I am not going to say that I burnt any churches. But let me put it this way: There was one person who started it. I was not found guilty of burning the Fantoft stave church, but anyway, that was what triggered the whole thing. That was the 6th of June and everyone linked it to Satanism ... What everyone overlooked was that on the 6th June, year 793, in Lindesfarne in Britain was the site of the first known [[Viking]] raid in history, with Vikings from Hordaland, which is my county.<ref>Michael Moynihan, ''Lords of Chaos'', p. 88; quoted in: M. Gardell, ''Gods of the Blood'', p.306;</ref></blockquote> 

In explaining the motives behind the church burnings, Vikernes said: "They [the Christians] desecrated our graves, our burial mounds, so it's revenge."<ref>quoted after M. Gardell, ''Gods of the Blood'', p.306</ref> Echoing this sentiment, he writes in ''Vargsm<U+00E5>l'': "For each devastated graveyard, one heathen grave is avenged, for each ten churches burnt to ashes, one heathen hof is avenged, for each ten priests or freemasons assassinated, one heathen is avenged."''<ref>quoted after M. Gardell, ''Gods of the Blood'', p.306, 307. Translation by M. Gardell</ref>

When asked whether the church burnings were linked to [[Odinism]] or [[<U+00C1>satr<U+00FA>]] he replied: "The point is that all these churches [i.e. church burnings] are linked to one person ... who was not [[<U+00D8>ystein Aarseth|<U+00D8>ystein]] obviously. All the church burnings, with the exception of Stavanger, because that was another group (who, by the way, have also turned into nationalistic pagans)."<ref>''Lords of Chaos'', p. 89</ref>

To coincide with the release of Mayhem's ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'', Vikernes and Aarseth had conspired to blow up [[Nidaros Cathedral]], which appears on the album cover. Aarseth's murder in August 1993 put an end to this plan and delayed the album's release.<ref name="onceuponatime">Martin Ledang, P<U+00E5>l Aasdal (2008). ''Once Upon a Time in Norway''.</ref>

===Murder of <U+00D8>ystein Aarseth===

On 10 August 1993, Vikernes and [[Thorns (band)|Snorre Ruch]] travelled from [[Bergen]] to Aarseth's apartment in [[Oslo]]. Upon their arrival a confrontation began, which ended when Vikernes fatally stabbed Aarseth. His body was found outside the apartment with twenty-three cut wounds <U+2013> two to the head, five to the neck, and sixteen to the back.<ref>Steinke, Darcey. "Satan's Cheerleaders" ''SPIN Magazine'', February 1996.</ref>

The motive for the murder is completely unclear. The entry on Varg Vikernes in the specialized ''[[Encyclopedia of White Power]]'' mentions that the murder has been "variously described as a power struggle between rival leaders of a satanic circle, a conflict over a girl's affection, or a dispute over a record contract".<ref name="Kapl-319">Kaplan 2000: 319</ref>

Vikernes himself contends "that Arseth planned to kill him and that he was striking first in self-defense".<ref name="Kapl-319"/>On his homepage Vikernes elaborates that Aarseth had plotted to [[torture]] him to death and videotape the event <U+2013> using a meeting about an unsigned [[contract]] as a pretext.<ref name = "nuokon">[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story02.shtml Varg Vikernes - A Burzum Story: Part II - Euronymous]</ref> On the night of the murder, Vikernes claims he intended to hand Aarseth the signed contract and "tell him to fuck off", but that Aarseth attacked him first.<ref name = "nuokon"/> Additionally, Vikernes defends that most of Aarseth's cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle.<ref name = "nuokon"/> After the slaying, Vikernes drove to a nearby lake to dispose of his bloodied clothes before he returned home.<ref name = "Young-p203">{{cite book | title=Metal: The Definitive Guide | year=2007 | author=Garry Sharpe-Young | pages=203}}</ref> 

At the arrest of Vikernes, a "substantial amount of explosives"<ref name="Kapl-319"/> was found in his possession. Vikernes has stated that they were "intended to blow up Blitz House, the radical leftist and anarchist enclave in Oslo",<ref name="Kapl-319"/> a plan which "was reportedly on the verge of execution"<ref name="Kapl-319"/> and only prevented by Vikernes' arrest.

In an article originally published in 1999, [[Kevin Coogan]] points to Vikernes' planned attack in the Blitz House as a possible motive for the murder of Arseth. Referring to the passages of ''Lords of Chaos'' quoted above, Coogan writes: "LOC offers strong evidence that Vikernes, who came from a divorced family and was raised by his mother Lene Bore, was a fascist well before he became a metalhead."<ref name="Coogan">Coogan 1999</ref> Then he, too, mentions Vikernes' intent to "destroy an Oslo-based punk anti-fascist squat called Blitz House",<ref name="Coogan"/> and concludes: "Vikernes may have felt that he had no choice but to kill Euronymous before bombing Blitz House because 'the Communist' would almost certainly have opposed such an act".<ref name="Coogan"/>

===Trial===

Vikernes' trial began on 2 May 1994. During the court case, the 22-year-old Snorre Ruch, who drove Vikernes to and from <U+00D8>ystein's apartment and stood outside during the incident, was put on trial together with Vikernes and sentenced to 8 years of imprisonment. Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years of imprisonment, the maximum sentence in Norway. He was found guilty of murdering <U+00D8>ystein Aarseth and the arson of several churches, one of which involved [[J<U+00F8>rn Inge Tunsberg|J<U+00F8>rn Tunsberg]] of black metal band [[Hades Almighty]]. In a controversial display, Vikernes actually smiled at the moment his verdict was read, an image that was widely reprinted in the news media.<ref name = "nuokon"/> 

===Life in prison and expected release===

During his time in prison, Vikernes has recorded two albums (''[[Dau<U+00F0>i Baldrs]]'' and ''[[Hli<U+00F0>skj<U+00E1>lf (album)|Hli<U+00F0>skj<U+00E1>lf]]''), which are composed of [[dark ambient]] songs. Vikernes was denied access to an electric guitar, bass guitar or drums, and instead used a [[synthesizer]]. In 2000, Vikernes terminated his musical project due to what he perceived to be negative notoriety. He believed that his philosophy was constantly misinterpreted by an ignorant fan base that was too closely related to black metal and [[Satanism]].<ref>[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/lords_of_chaos_review.shtml]</ref> Through his website, he has indicated that he intends to continue Burzum upon his release from prison, stating: "I will publish a few books, possibly using a pseudonym in order to stay anonymous, and perhaps a Burzum album or two, but that's it".<ref>[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story09.shtml A Burzum Story: Part IX - The Tomorrow]</ref> Regarding the style of his next album, Vikernes stated on his website: "[A future album] will as far as I can tell sound much like the old albums, whether I like it or not, because I'm incapable of making music that doesn't sound rather 'Burzumic'".<ref>[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/interview02.shtml Interview with Chris Mitchell] (10 May 2005)</ref>

In October 2003, Vikernes failed to return to his low-security prison in [[T<U+00F8>nsberg]], Norway after having been granted a short leave. He was found riding in a stolen Volvo car, which, according to the media, contained an unloaded AG3 automatic rifle, a handgun, numerous large knives, a gas mask, camouflage clothing, a laptop, a compass, a [[Global Positioning System]], various maps and a fake passport (it is thought that Vikernes came to be in possession of this equipment by means of a military barracks). For this thirteen months were added to his sentence, and he was then moved to a maximum-security prison in [[Trondheim]]. He has since been moved again, this time to [[Troms<U+00F8>]] Prison.<ref>Berglund, Nina. "Police nab 'The Count' after he fled jail" ''Aftenposten'' (English) 27 October 2003 [http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article655724.ece]</ref><ref name="aft001">Berglund, Nina. "Arrested 'Count' was heavily armed" ''Aftenposten'' (English edition) October 28, 2003 [http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article656646.ece]</ref>

When Vikernes was convicted, it was possible to be released on [[parole]] after serving 12 years of a 21-year sentence, but in 2002, before he became eligible,  the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] extended this to 14 years. In June 2006, after serving 12 years, Vikernes was denied parole by the Department of Criminal Justice for this reason.<ref>Rune Midtskogen, "Jeg er klar for samfunnet," ''Dagbladet'' June 6, 2008 http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2008/07/06/540102.html accessed Jan. 21, 2009</ref> His lawyer, John Christian Elden, has complained that the policy change is a form of [[Ex post facto law|retroactive legislation]]. Article 97 of the Norwegian constitution prohibits any law being given retroactive force.

Varg Vikernes was denied parole again in June 2008, although he is allowed to leave Troms<U+00F8> Prison for short periods to visit his family. His full sentence would run for another seven years.<ref>[[Aftenposten]], English edition, 11 June 2008:[http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2477398.ece Too dangerous for parole]</ref><ref>''[[Dagbladet]]'', 6 July 2008 [http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2008/07/06/540102.html]</ref><ref> [http://www.burzum.org/eng/news.shtml]</ref>

==Beliefs==

Next to the book ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos]]'', the main source for Vikernes' political and religious views is [http://www.burzum.org/ www.burzum.org]. There is however no third party source which confirms that the texts on that homepage were indeed written by Varg Vikernes. After his imprisonment in 1994 Vikernes began to write a manifesto called ''Vargsm<U+00E5>l'' ('Speech of the Varg'). Although some publishers were initially interested due to Vikernes' presence in the Norwegian media, they turned the book down as soon as they had the opportunity to read it, as its contents were considered too extreme.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} According to ''Lords of Chaos'', ''Vargsm<U+00E5>l'' became available on the internet for some time in 1996, but not in a printed form.<ref>''Lords of Chaos'' (1998):159</ref>  In 1997 a Norwegian publisher released a paperback edition of the book; its publication was financed by Vikernes' mother, Lene Bore.<ref name = "hist">{{cite book |last=Christe |first=Ian |title=Sound of the Beast: the Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Inc. |year=2003 |location=New York, New York |pages=279 |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=}}</ref> Vikernes has denounced the English translation of his book in an article on his website, stating that he never intended it to be available in the [[English language]] because that is the language of the Christian invaders.<ref>[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_comment_to_vargsmal_and_other_books_by_varg_vikernes.shtml Varg Vikernes - A Comment To "Vargsm<U+00E5>l" And Other Books By Varg Vikernes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Religion===

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Burzum-Flyer-92.jpg|thumb|right|Pro-Burzum Flyer with a list of church fires]] -->
Vikernes has written lyrics for several songs by [[Darkthrone]] that make use of themes from old [[Germanic folklore]]. In these, [[Satan]] is brought up in the context of an 'eye' that is a source of light (i.e. the sun), with mentions of a 'spear' and a 'hall of battle', all of which are masked references to the Germanic god [[Odin]]. This was done with the double meaning of Odin as the 'adversary' of [[Judaism|Jewish]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition. Many have thus inferred that Vikernes is or was a [[Satanism|Satanist]], though he has stated many times that he is opposed to Satanism as he considers it to be a reactionary form of Christianity.

According to Vikernes:
<blockquote>Christianity was created by some decadent and degenerated Romans as a tool of oppression, in the late Roman era, and it should be treated accordingly. It is like handcuffs to the mind and spirit and is nothing but destructive to mankind. In fact I don't really see Christianity as a religion. It is more like a spiritual plague, a mass psychosis, and it should first and foremost be treated as a problem to be solved by the medical science. Christianity is a diagnosis. It's like Islam and the other Asian religions, a [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] of the spirit and mind.<ref>[http://www.metalcrypt.com/pages/interviewsframe.php?intid=170 Vikernes' thoughts about Christianity from Metal Crypt E'Zine, 10 May 2005]</ref></blockquote>

Vikernes now embraces a "modern scientific worldview resting on a foundation made up of the [[Pagan]] values and ideals; loyalty, wisdom, courage, love, discipline, honesty, intelligence, beauty, responsibility, health and strength."<ref>[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_bards_tale08.shtml A Bard's Tale: Part VIII - Religion or Reason]</ref> He draws a direct connection between both [[race and intelligence]] and [[intelligence and religion]], denouncing [[theism]] as "mental enslavement" fit only for "inferior races".<ref name="autogenerated1">"Bard's Tale: part VIII: Religion or Reason" [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_bards_tale08.shtml]</ref> Vikernes goes on to say "If it is supposed to serve a purpose Paganism needs to be an ideology, not a religion".<ref name="autogenerated1" />

In addition to ''Vargsm<U+00E5>l'', works by Vikernes on his personal [[world view]] include ''Irmins<U+00FB>l'' and ''Germansk Mytologi og Verdensanskuelse'' ('Germanic Mythology and Worldview').

===Political affiliation===

Vikernes began identifying himself as a Nazi after his conviction.<ref>http://oraclesyndicate.twoday.net/stories/605560/</ref>  He founded the publisher and record label Cymophane Productions<ref>M.Gardell, ''Gods of the Blood'', p. 307</ref><!--,the neo-Nazi group (National Socialist) [[Hvit Arisk Motstand]] (''[[White Aryan Resistance]]''){{Fact|date=February 2007}}--> and in 1993 founded the [[Neo-v<U+00F6>lkisch movements|racialist]] [[Norsk Hedensk Front]] (''Norwegian Heathen Front''), which grew into the [[Heathen Front|Allgermanische Heidnische Front]].<ref>"Advocating national socialism, anti-Semitism, eugenics, and racist paganism, Vikernes launched Norsk Hedensk Front in 1993, which soon evolved into a network of independent tribes called the Allgermanische Heidnische Front (AHF)."'', M. Gardell, ''Gods of the Blood'', p. 307</ref>  His former ideas about Neo-Nazism and fascism can be found in several small pamphlets.{{Fact|date=June 2008}}  Vikernes states on his website that he no longer uses the term 'Nazi' as a self-description. However, Vikernes' statements on his homepage concerning the 'nazi ghost'  are rather ambiguous: 

<blockquote>The reason I have been drawn to and occasionally have expressed support for 'Nazism' is mainly because many of the Norwegian (and German) 'Nazis' embraced our Pagan religion as our blood-religion and they rejected Judeo-Christianity as Jewish heresy ... So, since I am not a 'Nazi' I began to use another term, in the late '90s. I did it not just to avoid confusion, but also to find a term more suitable and accurate than the other terms I had used. This new term was Odalism ... It is a term not tainted by history.<ref>[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story07.shtml A Burzum Story: Part VII - The Nazi Ghost]</ref></blockquote>

Yet of the "nazi ghost" he says:

<blockquote>
The 'nazi ghost' has scared millions of Europeans from caring about their blood and homeland for sixty years now, and it is about time we banish this ghost and again start to think and care about the things that (whether we like it or not) are important to us.<ref>[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story07.shtml Varg Vikernes - A Burzum Story: Part VII - The Nazi Ghost]</ref>
</blockquote>

In other texts on his homepage he still embraces [[racism]]<ref>With respect to what appears to be his interpretation of the [[Edda]], though there could be another source, Vikernes writes: "This is the mythology, a pretty unmistakably racist statement left to us from our forefathers."[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/paganism01.shtml Paganism: Part I - The Ancient Religion]</ref> and [[eugenics]] (''"race hygiene"'').<ref>"The mental hygiene and race hygiene practiced by the ancient Europeans also was disrupted by the introduction of Christianity." [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/paganism06.shtml Paganism: Part VI - Hygiene In The Pagan Era]</ref> However, he makes the point that following one's own culture is an equally valid and beneficial choice for all peoples.<ref>"[Odalism] is not only a more accurate but also a more inclusive term that can be used by all Europeans (and others too for that sake)". [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story07.shtml A Burzum Story: Part VII - The Nazi Ghos]</ref>

===Influence of Vidkun Quisling?===
[[Vidkun Quisling]], Nazi [[Collaborationism|collaborator]] prime minister of Norway between 1942 and 1945 and involuntary originator of the term [[quisling]]-regime, had developed an extremely obscure [[Esotericism|esoteric]] doctrine labelled 'Universism'. An online article<ref>[http://www.bitsofnews.com/content/view/3965/2/ "The World According to Quisling"] by Gisle Tangenes, BitsofNews.com, 19 September 2006</ref> about him mentions that the only "modest intellectual influence" he ever had with this doctrine was "on certain extreme strains of Norwegian black metal music". This impression is indeed given in ''Lords of Chaos''. In the interview there, Varg Vikernes is faced with the question whether Quisling's religion was pagan or Christian.<ref>Lords of Chaos (First Edition), 163</ref> Moynihan &  S<U+00F8>derlind write: "Vikernes has discovered his predecessor in Vidkun Quisling."<ref>Lords of Chaos (First Edition), 162</ref> At one point, he temporarily took the name 'Kvisling'<ref>[http://www.burzum.org/eng/discography/official/1997_daudi_baldrs.shtml Burzum - Discography - Official Releases - "Daudi Baldrs" ("Balder's Dod") 1997<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, but he explained this choice in ''Vargsm<U+00E5>l'':
<blockquote>One of my foremothers was called Susanne Malene Qisling. She was born 06-02-1811 and dies [''sic''] 10-05-1891. Qisling means "that which stems from a division of kingly descendants"[...]</blockquote>

In an interview available at www.burzum.com, he said, "They [the Norwegian government at the beginning of World War II] ran like chickens, leaving Norway, with absolutely NO authorities, and when Vidkun Quisling tried to bring order back, he was thanked with a bullet in his heart after the war."<ref>[http://www.burzum.com/burzum/library/interviews/heresy/ Burzum.com: The Music of Burzum and the Writings of Varg Vikernes (with 1993 interview)]</ref> This is the only known instance of Vikernes mentioning Vidkun Quisling, besides ''Lords of Chaos''; on www.burzum.org Vikernes does not mention Vidkun Quisling at all.<ref>other than the above-referenced mention of his great-great-grandmother's name: [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story05.shtml A Burzum Story: Part V - Satanism]</ref>

===The Lord of the Rings===

From an early age, Vikernes was fascinated with the fictional realm of [[Middle-earth]] created by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. His stage name ''[[Grishnakh#Grishn.C3.A1kh|Grishnackh]]'' is taken from that of a minor character in ''[[The Two Towers]]''. The name ''Burzum'', meaning ''darkness'', was taken from the [[Black Speech]] inscribed on the One Ring in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. The inscription read "Ash nazg durbatul<U+00FA>k, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatul<U+00FB>k agh ''burzum''-ishi krimpatul" or in English "One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the ''Darkness'' bind them." Additionally, before settling for Burzum, the band was initially named [[Uruk-Hai]].

Vikernes interpreted ''The Lord of the Rings'' on his website, allegedly showing the connections to paganism in the books (although there are some errors, such as identifying the order fronted by the character [[Saruman]] as the [[Valar]]). [[Tolkien]] was a professor in [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] [[linguistics]], and despite being of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith, he was ethnically Germanic and influenced by [[Pagan|pagan]] ideas.<ref name="burzum.org">[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story01.shtml]</ref> Vikernes criticized the film adaption of ''The Lord of The Rings'', stating that the portrayal of the people of [[Rohan]] (the Middle-earth equivalent of Germanic civilization<ref name="burzum.org"/>) as dirty, penniless villagers was wrong, since cleanliness, health, and especially bathing, were all values that were held very highly by Germanic people.<ref name="burzum.org"/> He went on to state that the women of southern Europe were much more attracted to Germanic men because they were "fairer and healthier", and since public bathing was outlawed by the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (even though Germany was a founding state of the Holy Roman Empire), many of the men that southern European women were exposed to were less attractive as mates. Vikernes feels that Tolkien's Catholic faith may have contributed to this bias.<ref>[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/paganism03.shtml Paganism: Part III - The One Ring]</ref>

==Publicity==
====Lords of Chaos====
{{Expand-section|date=November 2008}}
American journalist [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]] (behind the musical project [[Blood Axis]]) wrote a book entitled ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground]]'' with co-author Didrik S<U+00F8>derlind that is concerned with the events of the early black metal scene in Norway. There are two different reviews of this book available that are allegedly written by Varg Vikernes, one on www.burzum.org and one on www.burzum.com. Whereas the review on www.burzum.com is only mildly critical and states "The book is pretty much objective"<ref>www. burzum.com: [http://burzum.com/burzum/library/articles/lords_of_chaos/comment/ Varg Vikernes analyses the book Lords of Chaos, by Michael Moynihan and Didrik S<U+00F8>derlind]</ref>, the review on www.burzum.org states: 
<blockquote>I dare say the vast majority of all the statements made in this book are either misinterpretations; taken out of context; misunderstandings; malicious lies made by enemies; a result of ignorance; extreme exaggerations; and/or third-hand information at best. This includes the statements attributed to me! . . . [The authors] have no insight into or even good knowledge about the subjects discussed and ... don't understand one bit what Black Metal was about on 1991 and 1992 ... they have managed to fill the heads of a generation of metal fans with lies.
<ref>[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/lords_of_chaos_review.shtml "Lords Of Chaos: The Bloody Rise Of The Satanic Metal Underground" review]</ref></blockquote>

====Satan rir Media====
Torstein Grude created a Norwegian documentary entitled ''[[Satan rir media]]'' (''Satan Rides the Media''), to which Vikernes has given a more positive review. As its title implies, the movie focuses on the often hysterical media coverage of the church burning cases and the black metal scene in general. In the film, Vikernes accuses Finn Bj<U+00F8>rn T<U+00F8>nder (a journalist who writes for [[Bergens Tidende]] (BT)) of deliberately informing the police about his identity after he had completed an anonymous interview. Vikernes was arrested only hours after the interview, one day before it was published, and was released after a week in prison due to lack of proof. In the film Svein Erik Krogvoll (head of criminal investigations, Bergen Police District) evades the question whether T<U+00F8>nder preserved Vikernes' anonymity by stating "It was all OK and legal".

According to ''Satan rir Media'', it was also the BT who gave Vikernes the name "Greven" (The Count).  However, Vikernes has said in ''Vargsm<U+00E5>l'' that "[t]he reason I chose this name was not to have a tough name. The word "count (greve)" comes from the Latin word "comtes" that means partner or companion. I am the true Germanic folk's "partner" and "companion" and with that I chose this title".

''Satan rir Media'' claims that by emphasizing the Satanist angle, the Norwegian news media unwittingly created a mass following for Burzum and Vikernes, both in Norway and internationally.

===Influence on other church arsons===

* Novak Majstorovic, the 19-year-old guitarist of a metal band called "SchwarzReich", was charged with arson and burglary in relation to the torching of a 100+-year-old [[United and uniting churches|United Church]] in [[Ascot Vale, Victoria|Ascot Vale]], Australia in August 2004. He was convicted and sentenced to three years in Youth Detention. In all media depictions of the event he is said to have been heavily influenced by Burzum. However, he has stated on several message boards across the internet that the influence does not stretch beyond the superficial, and that the media has overblown his statements to the police to suit their own ends. He claims that the arson had very little in common with Vikernes' attacks. Majstorovic was released in August 2006. The church's priest has made no effort to contact Majstorovic, despite his promises to the media.<ref>Johnston, Chris.

* Kalle Holm, an 18-year-old [[Finland|Finn]] known to have played drums in several Finnish metal bands, has said on his website that he was influenced by Burzum. He set fire to the [[Porvoo Cathedral]] in Finland in May 2006: the roof of the church burned, but the ceiling, vaults and interiors survived undamaged. The attorney's claims that the motives behind the arson were related to a "hatred towards Christianity" were overruled in court. He was sentenced to three years and two months of imprisonment without parole.<ref>Helsingin Sanomat: [http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Porvoon+tuomiokirkon+tulipalosta+yli+kolmen+vuoden+vankeustuomio/1135221308860 Porvoon tuomiokirkon tulipalosta yli kolmen vuoden vankeustuomio] {{fi icon}}</ref> The sentence was later doubled to six years and six months by the Court of Appeal.<ref>Helsingin Sanomat: [http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Hovioikeus+kovensi+Porvoon+kirkon+sytytt%C3%A4j%C3%A4n+tuomiota/1135227276873 Hovioikeus kovensi Porvoon kirkon sytytt<U+00E4>j<U+00E4>n tuomiota] {{fi icon}}</ref>

* The ''[[Winnipeg Sun]]'' reported that three people were convicted on 27 June 2006 of arson in a fire that destroyed the Minnedosa [[United Church of Canada|United Church]] in [[Minnedosa, Manitoba]], Canada on 12 February 2006. One was sentenced to three years in prison, the second to two years and the third to two years less a day. All three were ordered to pay C$1.2 million in restitution. Justice officials said the church was set on fire on Vikernes' birthday (11 February).<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=54325 Canadian Black Metal Arsonists Receive Jail Time - 28 June 2006]</ref>
