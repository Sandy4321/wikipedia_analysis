"'''A Quiet Night In'''" is the second episode of [[British dark comedy]] [[anthology series]] ''[[Inside No. 9]]''. It first aired on 12 February 2014 on [[BBC Two]]. Written by [[Reece Shearsmith]] and [[Steve Pemberton]], it stars the writers as a pair of hapless burglars attempting to break into the large, [[modernist architecture|modernist]] house of a couple<U+2014>played by [[Denis Lawson]] and [[Oona Chaplin]]<U+2014>to steal a painting. Once the burglars make it into the house, they encounter obstacle after obstacle, while the lovers, not aware of the burglars' presence, argue. The episode progresses almost entirely without dialogue, relying instead on [[physical comedy]] and [[slapstick]], though more sinister elements are present in the plot. In addition to Pemberton, Shearsmith, Lawson and Chaplin, "A Quiet Night In" stars Joyce Veheary and [[Kayvan Novak]].

Shearsmith and Pemberton had originally considered including a dialogue-free segment in their television series ''[[Psychoville]]'', but ultimately did not; they found the format of ''Inside No. 9'' appropriate for revisiting the idea. Both journalists and those involved with the episode's production commented on the casting of Chaplin, granddaughter of [[silent film]] star [[Charlie Chaplin]], in an almost entirely dialogue-free episode, though her casting was not a deliberate [[Homage (arts)|homage]]. Critics generally responded positively to the episode, and a particularly laudatory review by David Chater was published in ''[[The Times]]'', prompting a complaint from a reader who found the episode more traumatic than comedic. On its first airing, "A Quiet Night In" was watched by 940,000 viewers (4.8% of the market).

Writers [[Steve Pemberton]] and [[Reece Shearsmith]], who had previously co-written and starred in ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'' and ''[[Psychoville]]'', took inspiration for ''Inside No. 9'' from "David and Maureen", episode 4 of the first series of ''Psychoville'', which was in turn inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]''. "David and Maureen" took place entirely in a single room, and was filmed in only two shots.<ref name="Independent">{{cite news|title= Inside No 9, TV review: A top-drawer cast puts these twisted tales in a league of their own|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/inside-no-9-tv-review-a-topdrawer-cast-puts-these-twisted-tales-in-a-league-of-their-own-9110196.html|author= Dean, Will|date= 5 February 2014|newspaper= [[The Independent]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150118212150/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/inside-no-9-tv-review-a-topdrawer-cast-puts-these-twisted-tales-in-a-league-of-their-own-9110196.html|archivedate= 18 January 2015}}</ref> At the same time, the concept of ''Inside No. 9'' was a "reaction" to ''Psychoville'', with Shearsmith saying that "we'd been so involved with labyrinthine over-arcing, we thought it would be nice to do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week.

The directors had expressed doubts, Shearsmith explained, because the success of dialogue-free television comes down entirely to the visuals and filming.<ref name="Why"/> "A Quiet Night In" was inspired by an idea Shearsmith and Pemberton had discussed for ''Psychoville''.<ref name="Why"/> The writers had considered omitting dialogue from a ten-minute section in an episode,<ref name="Interview"/> or even from the whole episode.<ref name="Why"/> Pemberton explained that this was not possible as there were "too many good jokes" which they wanted to fit into the sequence. This episode, like "A Quiet Night In", dealt with a break-in.<ref name="Why"/>

[[File:Chaplin A Dogs Life.jpg|thumb|left|The mostly dialogue-free episode starred [[Oona Chaplin]], granddaughter of [[silent film]] star [[Charlie Chaplin]] ''(pictured in 1918 as [[The Tramp]])''.]]''Inside No. 9'', for Pemberton, offered the "perfect vehicle" for revisiting the possibility of dialogue-free television.<ref name="Interview"/> Shearsmith said that, at the start of the writing process, the pair did not have the intention of scripting the entire episode without dialogue, and that it would be "great" to have ten minutes without it.

The story of "A Quiet Night In" revolves around a break-in, which, combined with an argument between the people living in the house, means that the characters all have a reason to be silent.<ref name="Interview"/><ref name="Why"/><ref name="Dessau interview"/> At 18 pages of stage directions, the script contained every joke in the episode, an exercise in planning atypical for Shearsmith and Pemberton.<ref name="Why"/> The story contains multiple "reveals"; Pemberton explained that the he and Shearsmith "hope there's an 'oh my God' moment. There is always a desire to wrong-foot the viewer. That's what you strive to do".<ref name="Dessau"/> Pemberton said that writing for a silent episode "makes you inventive in a completely different way".<ref name="Interview"/>

The episode was filmed at the White Lodge, in [[Oxted]], [[Surrey]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Episode 1.2 - A Quiet Night In|url= http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/inside_no_9/episodes/1/2/|publisher= [[British Comedy Guide]]|archivedate= 22 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222015349/http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/inside_no_9/episodes/1/2/}}</ref> The episode's burglars are played by the writers; the pair were quoted as saying "we didn't want to dominate [the series], so we sometimes play fairly minor characters. But we know that, say, if we were writing something about two burglars, we'd be the burglars."<ref name="Broadcast"/> Pemberton suggested that a partial influence for the episode may have been children's television series ''[[Brum (TV series)|Brum]]''. He said that the two of them had "always wanted to be a couple of robbers in that, so that might be where the idea came from".<ref name="Dessau interview"/> Both writers agreed it was "great to perform", and Pemberton described the resulting episode by saying that it "worked out better than we could have dreamed".<ref name="Why"/>

As the format of ''Inside No. 9'' requires new characters each week, the writers were able to attract actors who may have been unwilling to commit to an entire series.<ref name="Independent"/> In addition to Pemberton and Shearsmith, "A Quiet Night In" starred [[Denis Lawson]], Joyce Veheary, [[Oona Chaplin]] and [[Kayvan Novak]].<ref name="episode page">{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03vkx2t?intc_type=promo&|title= Inside No. 9, A Quiet Night In|publisher= BBC|archivedate= 14 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214122023/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03vkx2t?intc_type=promo&}}</ref> Pemberton commented on the appropriateness of casting Chaplin, granddaughter of [[silent film]] star [[Charlie Chaplin]], in an episode without dialogue.

Inside a large, modernist house,<ref>{{cite web|title=Inside No. 9|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2014/06/inside-no-9.html|publisher=BBC|accessdate= 16 February 2014}}</ref> Gerald (Lawson) turns on [[Rachmaninoff]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 2]] and sits down to soup brought by his housekeeper, Kim (Veheary). Through the windows behind him, burglars Eddie (Pemberton) and Ray (Shearsmith) are seen.{{#tag:ref|As the episode is mostly without dialogue, most of the characters' names are not revealed until the credits.|group=note}} Ray enters the house, then lets in Eddie while Gerald is using the toilet. Eddie is shocked to see that the pair have come to steal an almost completely white painting. Ray starts to dismantle the painting while Eddie keeps watch; he tries to guide a [[Yorkshire Terrier]] out of the patio window, but inadvertently lets in an [[Irish Wolfhound]]. As Ray releases the wolfhound, Eddie accidentally throws the terrier into the window, so Ray stuffs the dog into an umbrella stand.

Sabrina (Chaplin) walks down the stairs, and Ray puts the painting back and hides. Sabrina turns down Gerald's music to watch ''[[EastEnders]]''. Gerald returns, sitting away from Sabrina. He turns up his music and the pair fight over the television remote, before leaving through the patio door and arguing, though their voices are muffled. Ray cuts away the canvas and replaces it with kitchen roll. When Sabrina reenters, she unknowingly stands on the canvas. Kim picks it up, mistaking it for laundry, and heads into a laundry room as Sabrina walks upstairs. Eddie follows Kim and she sprays something into his eyes. Ray knocks out Kim and sees the canvas in a laundry basket, which is sent up a laundry chute. He runs upstairs, while Gerald remains outside.

Sabrina packs a holdall, including the contents of the laundry basket. She locks the case and heads into an ''en suite''. Downstairs, Gerald retrieves a pistol and heads back outside. Ray attempts to steal the key from Sabrina's discarded trousers and he sees that Sabrina is a [[transsexual]]. On the patio, Gerald points the gun into his mouth, as Eddie stumbles around in the lounge area, having accidentally pushed [[chilli peppers]] into his eyes. Ray hides under Sabrina's bed as she reenters the room; lying on a [[sex doll]] with both breasts and a penis, he is almost discovered. Eddie washes his face, and Gerald starts to play "[[Without You (Badfinger song)|Without You]]". Sabrina makes her way downstairs, taking the holdall's key. Sabrina and Gerald dance.

Ray drags the case to the top of the stairs and meets Eddie. Gerald lays Sabrina down on the sofa, places a cushion over her face and shoots her. Gerald turns off the music as the doorbell is heard. Answering the door, Gerald sees a man (Novak) who holds up a sign reading "Hello, my name is Paul. I am deaf & dumb." The reverse of the sign reads "Do you need any cleaning products today?" Gerald heads inside and hides Sabrina's body as Paul waits. Gerald splashes his soup onto the blood and invites Paul to clean it. Ray runs down the stairs and meets Paul; he proceeds to buy rope before returning upstairs. Paul continues to clean, but sees the bullethole in the cushion, and then the suitcase being lowered outside the window. Gerald heads outside to investigate, but Eddie and Ray drop the case on his head. The burglars run past Paul and look out to see the canvas in the pool, before both being shot by Paul. Paul rings someone and says "Hello, it's me. Yeah, it's done." He looks to the fake painting, and says "I've got it right here. Yeah, it's fine. Not a peep out of anyone." He takes down the painting and walks out, as the real canvas is seen sinking in the pool.

{{quotation|I told my husband how it was supposed to be the funniest thing ever, but we were horrified! I'll never be able to forget the little dog being thrown against the window and then stabbed to death by an umbrella <U+2013> nor the gay man killed by his lover, nor what they had under the bed - nor the deaf man killing the thieves. Having thieves tiptoe comically around the house before having their heads blown off did not make up for my trauma.<ref name="complaint"/>}}

In response, Wild said: "I am sorry if we left any permanent damage. In our defence, we did say 'black' comedy." Wild agreed with the reader's comment that she and her husband "must be very different kinds of people" from Chater.<ref name="complaint">{{cite news|url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/feedback/article4005992.ece|title= Why it has been all quiet on the royal front |author=Wild, Rose|date= 15 February 2014|accessdate= 21 February 2014|newspaper= [[The Times]]}} {{subscription needed}}</ref>
