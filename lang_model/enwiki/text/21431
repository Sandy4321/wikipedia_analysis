==Reception==

Critical reception to the program was largely negative.  ''[[Melody Maker]]'' stated: "McCartney has always had an eye and ear for full-blown romanticism, and nothing wrong with that, but here he too often lets it get out of hand and it becomes over blown and silly"{{sfn|Badman|2001}}.
