==Youth==
Turner was born weighing {{convert|10|lbs|kg}}. Within his first year, he endured [[chicken pox]], [[pneumonia]], [[asthma]], and [[measles]].

At the age of 3, he was hit by a car, resulting in a [[concussion]] and [[Surgical suture|stitches]].  Oversized baby teeth and an [[overbite]] caused a [[speech impediment]] that necessitated [[speech therapy]].<ref name=Tpttt>{{Cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/columns/story?columnist=oneil_dana&id=4683505|title=Turner perseveres through tough times: Through childhood sickness and the death of a friend, OSU star shines on and off court|accessdate=November 25, 2009|date=November 24, 2009|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|author=O'Neil, Dana}}</ref>
