'''Charles Wesley Powell''' (05 May 1854 - 18 August 1927) was an American hobbyist turned horticulturist specializing in the study of orchids ([[Orchidaceae]]).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Charles Wesley|title=List of orchidologists|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_orchidologists|website=Wikipedia|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=employee>{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Charles W.|title=United States, Panama Canal Sailing lists, 1905-1937|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-1961-40627-11784-79?cc=2193241|website=FamilySearch|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> He is credited with providing scientists the first large-scale collection of orchid specimens found in [[Panama]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Richard|first1=Eunice|title=Orchids and orchidology in Central America|journal=Panama Canal Review|date=1974|issue=Special Edition|page=20|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00097366/00172/19j|accessdate=15 October 2014}}</ref> In the early 1900s, he became internationally famous for his new discoveries and valuable contributions to orchidology by gathering, ''rediscovering'', cultivating, preserving, documenting, and forwarding-for-study a diverse assortment of hundreds of distinct specimens: yielding many new to science [[species]].<ref name=union>{{cite journal|last1=Heald|first1=Jean|title=Panama, The home of the orchid|journal=Bulletin of the Pan American Union|date=January 1927|volume=61|pages=671-678|url=https://archive.org/details/bulletinofpaname6127pana|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref>

Powell's specimen records (also known as herbarium specimens) and his Panama garden were studied by researchers at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew | Royal Botanical Gardens]], the Berlin Botanical Garden, Harvard University, the Smithsonian Institution, and the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]] (MBG). Dozens of orchid species were named in his honor.<ref name=lank /> In 1922, German botanist Rudolf Schlechter published his 95 page ''Orchidaceae Powellianae Panamenses'' (collections by C.

==Early life==
[[File: Charles Lesslie Pullen July 1854.1.jpg|thumb|Ben K. Pullen, 1854]]
Known to orchid enthusiasts as C. W. Powell, he was born '''Charles Lesslie Pullen''' in Richmond, Virginia, to Benjamin King Pullen Sr. and Minerva "Minnie" Anner ([[n<U+00E9>e]] Smith) Pullen.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pullin|first1=Chas. L.|title=Virginia, Births and Christenings, 1853-1917|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/X5KP-S2V|website=FamilySearch|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=expert /> He was the first-born of eight children. In a letter to Minnie dated July 29,1854, from Richmond, Ben Pullen writes about his son: {{cquote|Darling little Lesslie [as called in childhood; as spelled by father]  I am so glad he is well and cries for his pa. Bless his pure little heart. '[[Hush, Little Baby |Hush my baby]] don't you cry Your papa will come by ner bye.'  I would walk a mile to see him this minute. Mrs Anderson + Letitia Rowe were in the store yesterday. They send <u>a heap</u> of love to you + Lesslie. [...] Affectionately Ben K. Pullen}}

In 1860, 6 year old Lesslie and his family moved, by train, {{convert|800|mile|km}} southwest to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], for the opening of his father's china store. Shortly thereafter, Lesslie was uprooted again when his family relocated {{convert|50|mile|km}} south for several years. There they struggled to survive on a cousin<U+2019>s farm near [[Sardis, Mississippi]], during the [[Union Army]]'s occupation of [[Battle of Memphis|Memphis]] in the [[American Civil War]] and Ben Pullen Sr.'s service as a [[Confederate Army]] officer.<ref name=bio /><ref>{{cite web|last1=Pullen|first1=B K|title=United States Census, 1870|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MD8Q-Z42|website=FamilySearch|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref>  Perhaps this experience was Lesslie's introduction to [[agriculture]].

==Family life, bookkeeper, book-lover, genealogist==
;1870s
After the War, the Pullens moved back to Memphis. In 1871, hard times in the South forced Lesslie<U+2019>s father to advertise his store's closing. By the mid-1870s, Ben Pullen Sr. was a bookkeeper for the State National Bank and Lesslie, now calling himself Charles, was a collector for the bank.

In 1877 he married Adelaide "Addie" Belle Prince (1858-1901), the daughter of a [[Mississippi]] antebellum cotton planter.<ref>{{cite web|title=Addie Belle Pullen|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=103459437&ref=acom|website=findagrave.com|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> In 1879, the couple's first child, Charles Lesslie was born (living only a few months). Six more children would follow: Bessie, an unnamed infant,<ref>{{cite web|title=infant Pullen|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln=Pullen&GSiman=1&GScid=11738&GRid=103459594&|website=findagrave.com|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> David (died young),<ref>{{cite web|title=David Hadden Pullen|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=103459757|website=findagrave|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> Adelaide "Addie", Minerva "Minnie", and Margaret. Bessie was born in 1880, and the couple's latter three daughters were born in 1887, 1891, and 1898 respectively.

The [[History of yellow fever#Lower Mississippi Valley: 1878|Yellow Fever]] Epidemic hit Memphis in 1878 claiming, among thousands, the life of Pullen<U+2019>s mother.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Keating|first1=John McLeod|title=A History of the Yellow Fever: The Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1878, in Memphis|date=1879|publisher=Wrightson & CO.|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|page=194, 240|edition=1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZQMW-S0MRjkC&q=pullen#v=snippet&q=pullen&f=false|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref>
;1880s
In the early 1880s, Pullen was appointed to serve Memphis in several leadership positions. Detail oriented, well-read, and popular, he served as Secretary of the Legislative Council of Memphis; Secretary of the Fire and Police Commissioners Board; and Clerk for the Supervisors of Public Works, earning $100 per month. Documenting the day-to-day business of a struggling city, he proved valuable to the citizens who put him in office.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pullen|first1=Chas L.|title=Digest of the Acts Repealing the Charters of Certain Municipal Corporations|date=1898|publisher=S.

He was not only a bookkeeper, but also a book-lover; Pullen collected rare books. His interests went beyond the literary world, however. He conducted exhaustive research on his Pullen and Smith [[genealogy]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pullen|first1=Charles L|title=Dedham Historical Register, Volume 2|date=1891|publisher=Dedham Historical Society|location=Dedham, MA|pages=40, 82|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z4slAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=chas+l+pullen+memphis&source=bl&ots=Ns4EnpRD05&sig=u88PZu5E_zqv_83WqpQBAcjTt5c&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Bm0QVOL4DYWHyAT4vIBo&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=chas%20l%20pullen%20memphis&f=false|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> Relentless in his pursuit of ancestral names and important dates, he advertised for information throughout [[New England]].

==New life: country, name, career, passion==
===Also known as (aka) Charles Wesley Powell===
Some combination of events prompted a relatively unconnected Charles L. Pullen to move {{convert|1600|mile|km}} south to Panama. Exactly when and why he reinvented himself as Charles Wesley Powell is a mystery. In a 1928 biography of Powell, some elements of his pre-Panama days are not supported by facts: leading one to wonder why and by whom (probably Powell himself) the details of his life in the U. S. were altered.<ref name=bio /> From 1907<U+2013>1927 he would support himself by working in various positions in a Canal Zone dispensary (basic medical facility) or hospital. With a salary of $60 per month, he started out dispensing [[quinine]] (antimalarial drug) at a labor camp in old Gatun (now covered by 80 feet of rock and earth under Gatun Dam). It is not surprising he would be hired for a position in which precise record keeping was important. To better communicate with patients, he studied Spanish. Soon he was certified as a nurse.

"In 1908 Powell transferred to [[Portobelo, Col<U+00F3>n | Porto Bello]] [on the Caribbean Sea] as a dispensary assistant and took up fishing as a hobby, using a row-boat. Early 1910 finds Powell working in a dispensary in [old] Gorgona (now submerged 80 feet below the surface of [[Gatun Lake]]) and fishing in Panama Bay. The local fishermen called him 'Pescadore Grande' (great fisherman). Switching his fishing from Panama Bay to Gatun Lake soon followed."<ref name=bio />

===Powell's orchid garden takes root===
"I can remember my first orchid, I was just looking over the country one Sunday, about 18 months after I got down there [Balboa] when I saw it way up near the top of a tall tree. 'You're certainly a beauty,' I said. 'I must have you.' While I was standing there wondering how on earth to climb that tree a bare-footed Indian came along. 'I'll give you 25 cents gold to get that flower,' I said. The Indian used the vines to swing to the tree [like [[Tarzan]]] and cut off the orchid."<ref name=man /> This acquisition coupled with the memorable experience at Gatun Lake echoing in his mind led to a watershed moment for Powell; "he lost no time starting an orchid garden."<ref name=fish /> "Powell started his collection on his front porch [late 1915]. When that got so packed with plants he couldn't move, he started an annex by building a tier of shelves on the rear wall of his house."<ref name=man /> "It wasn't long until both were overflowing and he had to construct a latticed roof and screened-in, vine-clad, wire mesh walls."<ref name=man /> "The establishing of the garden was actuated by the act of Mrs. A. H. Bryan presenting Mr. Powell with about a thousand plants, and a further donation by Charles H. Beetham."<ref name=bio /> There was nothing published on growing orchids outdoors: Powell ''pioneered'' the techniques. "He studied the orchid intelligently: learning, throughout the years about orchids from books, worldwide correspondence, and visitors."<ref name=fish>{{cite news|title=Fish are forgotten in quest for flowers|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/26508983/|accessdate=14 September 2014|publisher=The Edwardsville Intelligencer|date=June 9, 1936}}</ref> About the books he remarked: "I couldn't read a French or German newspaper, but with a little Latin I could make out the technical works."<ref name=man />

===Flower Power===
{{See also|Orchidelirium}}
References to the power and allure of the wild orchid are peppered throughout the world's cultural, historical, and contemporary beliefs. As far back as the fifth century BC, the Chinese philosopher Confucius used wild orchids as symbolism to deepen the meaning of his poems; "he compared the virtuous man to an orchid.

Specifically, the prevailing belief about orchids during Powell's lifetime was described thusly: "There is one plant, which stands so far above all the rest for unique beauty and grandeur that it is universally regarded as the aristocrat of the floral kingdom, namely, the orchid. The Central American orchids, above all others in North or South America, are regarded as furnishing the climax [occupying the highest point] and should be called the 'aristocrat of the aristocrats.'"<ref name=moore>{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=George, T.|title=Latin America and the queen of flowers|journal=Bulletin of the Pan American Union|date=August 1931|volume=12|pages=1-9|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oUUzAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA118&dq=powell+orchid+garden+balboa&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZbtFVNroE5aqyATNk4KYDQ&ved=0CFwQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q=powell%20orchid%20garden%20balboa&f=false|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref>

Some biographical sources indicate Powell collected orchids beginning with his arrival in Panama in 1907; however, is seems more likely his collecting began after he settled in Balboa.<ref>{{cite web|title=JSTOR Global Plants: Powell, Charles W.|url=http://plants.jstor.org/person/bm000036257|website=plants.JSTOR.org|accessdate=25 October 2014}}</ref> At first he collected locally; ultimately, his objective was to "assemble a complete collection of Panama species."<ref name=report /> "Powell and Hunter went on collecting trips in the Chiriqu<U+00ED> region in 1918, 1920, and 1922; Powell went there without Hunter in 1924. Powell's last collecting trip was to the Veraguas Province in March, 1925."<ref name=bio /> In 1931, [[George Thomas Moore | George T. Moore]], director of the MBG wrote: "The perils and experiences of the early orchid hunters were as thrilling and romantic as those of any arctic explorer."<ref name=moore /> About the typical orchid hunter, Susan Orlean had this to say: "[[Orchid hunting]] hasn't really changed over the last 200 years and orchid hunters haven't really changed. You have to be brave; you have to be somewhat foolish."<ref name=Orlean />

'I never saw you before,' I thought, and 'I won't let you get away, barranca or no barranca.'  My man shinned out a few feet (roughly a meter) on that dying branch and then scurried back, scared at the prospect of a 500-foot (150 m) fall. That made me mad. I threw off my hat, coat, and shoes and went after that orchid. Just as I reached out for it the branch cracked. My heart stopped. But I never let loose my grip on that plant and scurried back to earth like a scared chipmunk. And that&mdash;that was the first time I ever saw the Odontoglossum Powellia.<ref name=man />

[[George H.

"In many instances, to dislodge the epiphyte [an "air plant", ''growing non-parasitically'', sometimes 40-50 feet from the ground] without climbing the tree, it is necessary to cut a sapling with a forked-top as long as the distance up to where it clings. Its roots in some cases are three to four feet long, and great dexterity is required to dislodge it as to not cause injury. During this operation, clouds of dust, granulated bark and moss which rain down from above almost blind the collector."<ref name=bull1927 /> "These men got many fine specimens through this method."<ref name=fish />

As his garden expanded over the years, Powell's orchid documentation, and jungle explorations took a new path. Pursuit, care, and documenting his beloved orchids occupied most of his spare time. "Although 193 [now 195] of Powell<U+2019>s [[specimens]] were recorded without dates; the first dated records of collections began in 1915. In early 1918, realizing that many of his plants were not described in his books, he made contact with [[Robert Allen Rolfe | R. Allen Rolfe]] at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England."<ref name=lank /> A package C. W. P. (Powell) sent Rolfe was acknowledged by the latter via ''The Orchid Review'' (May 1918): "The package duly arrived, but was badly broken and the contents missing. Perhaps further materials can be sent.

;Herbarium specimen preparation
{{See also|Herbarium}}
Transitioning from hobbyist to horticulturist, Powell needed a way to forward his finds to researchers and preserve them for future reference. He studied the standardized method for [[specimen]] preservation and storage. Specimens were typically preserved by extracting moisture in a device called a plant press. Although he was initially cautioned against it, he added artificial heat (an electric iron) which aided in the quality of the results in the tropics.<ref name=report /><ref name=bulletin>{{cite web|title=Missouri Botanical Garden bulletin|url=http://archive.org/stream/mobot31753002461801/mobot31753002461801_djvu.txt|website=archive.org|accessdate=17 October 2014}}</ref> The pressed plant could then be affixed to a mounting sheet (11 X 17 inch paper). Label data (essential documentary information) was added. Once label data was added to the mounting sheet, it was ready for shipping. The mounting sheet (specimen) became a candidate for long-term storage in a repository (like the [[Harvard University Herbaria]]). Once accepted, the mounting sheet would then be known as a [[herbarium]] specimen. At first he sent just the preserved flowers, but soon he was asked to send preserved plants that included the roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and seeds. Powell painstakingly crafted his mounting sheets; he enhanced them with fieldnotes, illustrations, flower cutouts, and photographs. His original sheets would stand on their own as works of art; over time they have evolved into beautiful, remarkably detailed documents.

In July, 1918, Powell sent Rolfe a series of herbarium specimens. It took roughly 8 months for a portion (29) to be determined, communication slowed; Rolfe was in ill health and died before he had a chance to [fully] study Powell<U+2019>s collection.<ref name=review1919>{{cite journal|last1=Rolfe|first1=R.

;"Parasita Grande"
Accustomed to dogged pursuit in genealogy research, Powell pressed on.

His fellow researchers began to take notice. Powell was persistent, he infused enthusiasm in his dealings, and he instilled in his fellow researchers the confidence that&mdash;he had something to offer in the confusing world of the [[Orchidaceae]]. "Mr. Powell's enthusiasm for these plants has caused him to be locally termed 'the Orchid Man' ('Parasita Grande'), and his garden is one of the show places in Balboa to both the botanist and tourist."<ref name=bulletin /> Perhaps while acting as tour guide, the idea&ndash;to someday donate his garden&ndash;sprouted; little did he know how much joy and peaceful beauty his expanding orchid collection would one day bring to visitors of a botanical garden {{convert|2300|mile|km}} away. The reputation of Powell's Horticultural Garden, Balboa, Canal Zone began to grow on a global scale.

===Associations with world's leading authorities===
The relationships between the orchid experts of the time were complicated; mutual respect, admiration, cooperation and financial support of each other were interwoven with intense competition, rivalry, and double-dealing.<ref name=lank />
;Powell and Schlechter
Beginning in 1919, thanks to a tip from a correspondent in [[Costa Rica]], German botanist [[Rudolf Schlechter]] (curator of the herbarium at the Berlin Botanical Garden) began corresponding with and receiving numerous duplicate specimens (ones originally sent to Rolfe) from Powell. "Schlechter immediately recognized the importance of the plant collection, and encouraged Mr. Powell in every way to send in further specimens."<ref name=CZreport /> "Schlechter took up the [[Taxonomy (biology) | taxonomy]] (classification) of Panamanian orchids in August, 1920."<ref name=bio /> "An astonishing number of plants proved to be entirely new to science (not less than 75)."<ref name=CZreport /><ref name=bulletin /> Schlechter added: "Just as important as the new species is the rediscovery of a whole series of species, having originally been discovered by [[J<U+00F3>zef Warszewicz | Warszewicz]], but never found again."<ref name=sch /> "Schlechter wrote to Powell: 'Your exploration of the orchid flora of Panama is one of the most important facts in orchidology during the later years.'<U+201D><ref name=lank /> Schlechter named dozens of species in Powell's honor (see Schlechter's author abbreviation, Schltr., in "Legacy" below). Waiting until after Rolfe's death (1921), in 1922, Schlechter published his 95 page ''Orchidaceae Powellianae Panamenses'' (collections by C. Powell) part of which transcribes as follows: "It is sure that no one has made such a contribution to our knowledge of these orchids as Mr. Powell through his 'exceedingly mighty collection,' which contains not only species with conspicuous flowers, but also those in which the size of the blooms scarcely exceeds that of a pin-head."<ref name=sch>{{cite book|last1=Schlechter|first1=Rudolf|title=Orchidaceae Powellianae Panamenses|date=1922|publisher=Verlag des Repertoriums|location=Germany}}</ref><ref name=bulletin /> "We cannot thank Mr. Powell enough for this self-sacrificing research that he has undertaken in spite of his age.

;Powell, Oakes Ames, and Blanche Ames
In 1922, Powell began relations with Harvard University<U+2019>s [[Oakes Ames_(botanist) | Oakes Ames]], a botanist, and the most eminent American orchid authority at the time. Due to intense competition with Schlechter, "Ames went so far as to sign with Powell a formal contract in which the latter would collect orchids for him for U.S. $100 per month. From that point forward, Powell only sent Schlechter duplicate specimens. Ames met Powell in Panama in 1923. That same year, Ames praised the quality of Powell<U+2019>s work: 'His indefatigable zeal is one of the joys in my contemplation of Central American orchidology. His specimens are often works of art.'<U+201D><ref name=lank /> Based on an orchid from Powell's garden, Ames' wife, [[Blanche Ames Ames]], recognized as an outstanding botanical illustrator, enriched one of her husband's specimens by painting this [http://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/view/5843737 <span style="color:#0000FF">watercolor</span>].

;Powell and Lankester
In September of 1922, Powell sent a letter to Ames introducing "my good friend" [[:es:Charles H. Lankester]]. Lankester, a British coffee grower, naturalist, and orchidologist, was living in [[Cartago, Costa Rica]], a country with great potential for new to science orchid species. Powell facilitated what would become a "deep friendship between Lankester and Ames that lasted 25 years."<ref name=lank /> Traveling to Costa Rica in 1925, Powell visited Lankester, who in turn traveled to Panama in 1927. <U+201C>I have just spent a fortnight with my fellow sufferer from orchiditis, CWP, + it was a very delightful time of talk and talk and then talk.<U+201D><ref name=lank /> Lankester's orchid garden transformed over time into the [[Lankester Botanical Garden | Lankester Botanical Gardens]].

Of roughly 50,000 workers, only 1,661 medalists earned the second bar.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Canal Medal List|journal=Panama Canal Record|date=August 27, 1913|volume=VII|issue=35|page=332|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00097368/00007/356x?search=powell&vo=11|accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Roosevelt Medal with Two Bars|url=http://www.coins-of-panama.com/canalmedals/cm10-2.html|website=Coins-of-Panama.com|accessdate=25 October 2014}}</ref>

===''Desiderata'': "The answer was orchids"===

Life in early 1900s Panama presented a unique opportunity for Powell to find his passion in orchids. The labor requirement for the construction of the Panama Canal provided him with a livelihood; and an outing on the newly created Gatun Lake awakened a desire to "catch" orchids instead of fish.<ref name=fish /> Soon, he would become a man with a mission: a man with direction and purpose. Powell searched high and low for beautiful, rare and new-to-science orchids with great vigor. He risked life and limb to acquire his specimens. The worldwide correspondence, camaraderie, conversation and competition among like-minded orchid lovers suited his nature. What started out as a hobby, earned him a global identity. Powell's orchid garden was the culmination of his later life's efforts: the essence of a late bloomer. Charles Wesley Powell's donation was the manifestation of his calling to serve mankind by contributing to the greater common good. 

''Desiderata'' (Latin: "desired things"):

'''naturally I wanted something I had never seen.'''

'''The answer was orchids.'''<ref name=man /> &mdash;Powell, 1926
