The {{nihongo|'''''Hayasui'''''|<U+901F><U+5438>}} was a Japanese fleet oiler (hybrid tanker/carrier) of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN), serving during the [[World War II]].

==Construction==
''Hayasui'' was completed as one of the [[Japanese fleet oiler Kazahaya|''Kazahaya'' class fleet oiler]]s. After lack of reconnaissance planes was identified as a contributing factor to defeat of the IJN at the [[Battle of Midway]], aviation facilities were added to ''Hayasui'' for accompanying the carrier task force.  The IJN added the function of food supply ship to ''Hayasui'' to improve carrier task force endurance following experience at the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]].

==Service==
*24 April 1944 : Completed.
*May 1944 : Sailed to [[Tawi-Tawi]] for ''Operation A''.
*19 to 20 June 1944 : Participation to the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] and damaged.
*10 August 1944 : Repairs were completed for [[convoy Hi-71]] departure from [[Moji-ku, Kitaky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>|Moji]] to [[Singapore]].

==Fate==
*03:20, 19 August 1944 : ''Hayasui'' was torpedoed (2 hits) by [[USS Bluefish (SS-222)|USS ''Bluefish'']] at west of [[Vigan City]].
*About 05:00 : Explosion and sunk at {{coord|17|34|N|119|24|E}}.
*10 October 1944 : Decommissioned.
