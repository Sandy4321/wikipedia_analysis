[[Image:Sow and five piglets.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[pig]] is considered an unclean animal in [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]]]]
'''Unclean animals''', in some [[religion]]s, are [[animal]]s, on whose consumption or handling is labelled a [[taboo]]. According to these religions' dogmas, persons who handle such animals may need to [[Ritual purification|purify]] themselves to get rid of their uncleanness.

==History==
The origins of practices in relation to "clean animals" and "unclean animals" are lost to [[prehistory]] but are maintained by several large [[religion]]s.  The idea that some animals are dangerous or disgusting is present in almost all known human cultures. This could be due to the fact that in ancient times people had not realized how to preserve and prepare some foods. Pork for instance if not prepared or stored properly can cause illness as can some seafood. Pigs are also common vectors in transmission of the flu to humans from birds since they are immunologically similar to humans. By labeling the animal as unclean and forbidden, consumption and handling of those potentially dangerous foods would not occur.

==Judaism==
In [[Judaism]], [[Kashrut]] (''[[Kosher foods|kosher]]'') is the set of dietary laws governing what can or cannot be consumed. These laws are based upon the [[Torah]] and the [[Talmud]]. According to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], mammals that ''both'' chew their cud ([[Ruminant|ruminate]]) and have [[Cloven hoof|cloven hooves]] are kosher<ref Name="Glover">{{cite book  | last = Glover  | first = Alfred Kingsley   | title = Jewish Laws and Customs: Some of the Laws and Usages of the Children of the Ghetto  | publisher = W.A.

In the context of Judaism, the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy from the [[Hebrew Bible]] specify what must not be consumed.

The Book of Leviticus states: 
{{cquote|Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the [[cud]], or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.|||[[wikisource:Bible_(King_James)/Leviticus#Chapter 11|<U+2013> Leviticus 11:4]]}}

It should be noted that the translations of some of the aforementioned animals from the Hebrew are a matter of dispute in classical Jewish commentaries. With respect to birds the Torah only specifies ones which may not be eaten and the translations of these are also a matter of contention in traditional Jewish texts so it is common practice to eat only birds with a clear tradition of being kosher, eg. domestic fowl.

Many additional animals are not mentioned specifically by name, but from the characteristics mentioned in the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy, may also be considered to be unclean. For example, all [[shellfish]] are generally considered unclean. Examples of animals often considered to be unclean by their characteristics:

[[wikisource:Bible_(King_James)/Leviticus#Chapter_11|Leviticus 11:20<U+2013>23]] permits certain kinds of "winged swarming things" (i.e. [[insect]]s) while prohibiting others; however, today [[rabbi]]s are uncertain as to which insects were specifically permitted, so now all insects are prohibited to be on the safe side.{{ref|insects}}  An exception to this is a number of Yemenite communities that have retained their own traditions with respect to kosher locusts.  As a result these particular locusts ([[Schistocerca gregaria]]) are considered kosher for the specific community which has the tradition.  [[Bee]]s' [[honey]] is, however, considered kosher{{ref|honey}} because the honey is not made by bees, but is rather collected [[Nectar]] and concentrated by bees.  There are no exceptions to the rule that any product of a non-kosher animal is also non-kosher, for example [[gelatin]] (but see the controversy on [[shellac]]).  Within the past twenty years "kosher gelatin" has begun appearing.  Some of this is derived from [[cow]]s or from [[fish]] and made in a manner keeping with kosher traditions; others are derived from a [[plant]] or [[seaweed]] base using [[agar]] or [[pectin]].{{ref|gelatin}}

In order to eat an animal or bird it must be slaughtered according to Jewish law (''[[Shechita]]''). This involves cutting the animal's [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and [[esophagus]], the [[carotid artery]] and [[jugular vein]] are also severed in this operation &ndash; as are most arteries and veins leading to and from the brain &ndash; with a sharp knife that has been thoroughly checked for imperfections beforehand. The cut must be swift and without pause, to avoid tearing, and must be performed by an expert. Fish and Locusts must be killed before allowed to be eaten, but no particular method has been specified in Jewish law.

The animal must then be determined to be free of ''[[treifot]]'' &ndash; which are 70 different categories of injuries, diseases and abnormalities &ndash; whose presence renders the animal non-kosher.

Not all parts of the animal may be eaten; certain [[fat]]s, known as ''[[Chelev]]'', may not be eaten. As much blood as possible must be removed from the meat, either by soaking, salting and rinsing or by broiling over a fire. In addition the [[sciatic nerve]] in each leg and the fat surrounding the nerve must be removed.

It is forbidden to cook, eat, or derive any benefit from [[Kosher foods#No mixing of meat and dairy|mixtures]] of [[milk]] and [[meat]] (and their by-products). It is also forbidden to cook or eat dairy products together with poultry as a rabbinic injunction against mixing milk and meat.

===Clean animals in Judaism===
The term '''clean animals''' in the Hebrew bible is a misnomer as the actual term refers to the 'purity' and 'impurity' of the animal, which itself is a reference to the status the animal has in terms of [[Kashrut]] and its eligibility for sacrifice. Hence all pure or clean animals are allowed to be eaten [are Kosher] while the unclean or impure animals may not be eaten. These land, sea, or air creatures are listed in the book of [[Leviticus]] in the [[Torah]] and have different criteria for kosher consumption as follows: All animals that have the characteristics of having completely divided hooves and also chew their [[cud]] are by definition clean. All [[fish]] that have both scales and fins are clean. There are no biblical signs for poultry as the bible simply delineates 24 specific species of bird as being non-kosher with all other birds being by default, kosher.  

===Examples of Kosher animals===
This list contains animals which, while not specified in the Hebrew Bible,  are considered to be clean, based on characteristics described in Leviticus 11.

==Islam==
In [[Islam]]ic [[Muslim dietary laws|dietary laws]] several animals are considered unclean and not to be eaten (''[[Haraam]]''), while others are permitted (''[[Halaal]]''), as long as they have been killed or slaughtered in the correct manner. Halaal and Haraam are dissimilar to the Jewish Kashrut in that they also encompass behavior, speech, dress, conduct and manner. In non-Arabic-speaking countries however, the terms are most commonly used in the narrower context of [[Muslim]] dietary laws, especially where meat and poultry are concerned, though they can be used for the more general meaning as well.

The [[Qur'an]] states:

<blockquote style="background: #F0F0F0; border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em;">"Forbidden to you are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of [[pig|swine]], and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than Allah. that which hath been killed by [[strangulation|strangling]], or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by being [[wiktionary:gore#Etymology 2|gore]]d to death; that which hath been eaten by a wild animal; unless ye are able to slaughter it; that which is sacrificed on stone [altars]; [forbidden] also is the division by raffling with arrows: that is impiety...But if any is forced by hunger, with no inclination to transgression, Allah is indeed Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful." [[wikisource:Qur'an (English translation)#Al-Maidah - The Table Spread|<U+2013> Al-Maidah 5:3]]</blockquote>

According to Muslims the most important condition is that ''[[bismillah]]'' (pronouncing the name of Allah) be performed at the time of slaughter. Also important is that the meat of those animals were ended by ''[[Halaal#Zabiha .28method used to slaughter animals.29|Zabiha]]'' ([[Sharia]] slaughter) of which tasmiyah is a condition. If not those animals are considered Maytah ([[carrion]]) and are expressly forbidden. The meat of animals slaughtered by a ''[[Shirk (idolatry)|Mushrik]]'' ([[polytheism|polytheist]]) is forbidden. However, the food of Jews and Christians are permissible: "The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them." [[wikisource:Qur'an (English translation)#Al-Maidah - The Table Spread|<U+2013> Al-Maidah 5:4]]</blockquote>

===Dogs===
[[Image:Saluki dog breed.jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Dog]]s are considered unclean according to some who study Islamic law. However, a [[Saluki]], such as above, is in some cases cherished by Muslims.]]

[[Dog]]s are mentioned in the book of Islam the [[Quran]] several times e.g. in [[sura]] 18 where a dog is a companion of the dwellers of the Cave. The Quran also tells that it is permissible to eat what trained dogs catch (5:4). Nevertheless, many Islamic teachers state dogs should be considered unclean and that Muslims licked by them must perform [[Ritual purification#Islam|purification]]. According to a Sunni Islam Hadith, a plate that a dog has used for feeding must be washed seven times for a person to eat from one of which is using clean sand.   

According to the majority of Sunni scholars, dogs can be owned by farmers, hunters, and shepherds, for the purpose of hunting and guarding.

Another exception appears to be made by the [[Bedouin]] in the case of the [[Saluki]]. They are allowed in the tents and considered special companions.

==Christianity==

In the Bible, the books Leviticus and Deuteronomy contain lists of unclean animals but the idea can also be found in the book of [[Genesis]] in the story of [[Noah]] and the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]].
{{cquote|Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth|||[[Wikisource:Bible (King James)/Genesis/Chapter 7]]}}

In the very early days of [[Christianity]] it was debated if converts ought to follow Jewish customs (including circumcision and dietary laws) or not. A decision was reached at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], though the extent and application of this decision has been a matter of some debate. (Some see a parallel with the [[Noahide Laws]] - See also: [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Genesis#Chapter 7|Genesis 7:2]]). In the [[Acts of the Apostles]] the "apostles and elders" promulgated the decision in a letter "to the Gentile believers":

<blockquote style="background: #F0F0F0; border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em;">"For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; that ye abstain from meats{{ref|grkbroma}} offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled ..." [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 15|<U+2013> Acts 15:28-29]]</blockquote>

The commonly held [[theology|theological]] position is that with the death and resurrection of [[Jesus]], the "Old Covenant" and its restrictions no longer apply (See [[Old Testament#Christian_view_of_the_Law|Christian View of the Law]] for the different viewpoints). 

In the [[Pastoral Epistles|First Epistle to Timothy]] it states:

<blockquote style="background: #F0F0F0; border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em;">"...commanding to abstain from meats{{ref|grkbroma1}}, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For every creature{{ref|grkktisma}} of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer." [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Timothy#Chapter 4|<U+2013> 1 Timothy 4:3-5]]</blockquote>

In the [[Epistle to the Colossians]] it states:

<blockquote style="background: #F0F0F0; border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em;">"...Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ....Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; 15 And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it. 16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days." [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Colossians#Chapter 2|<U+2013> Colossians 2:8-16]]</blockquote>

However, there are [[Christian Torah-submission|Torah-submissive Christians]] who hold different interpretations of passages such as those cited and believe that the dietary restrictions continue under the [[New Covenant|new covenant]]. For example, in [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 11|Acts 11:8]] Peter was convinced that it would be out of character for the Lord to recommend an unclean diet. (See also [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 10|Acts 10:10-17]] for context.) [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 11|Acts 11:11,18]] clarifies Peter's vision. These verses indicate that God was instructing him not to refer to gentiles as "unclean" as it was common in Israel, indicating that salvation had been extended to the gentiles. One modern example of a Torah-submissive group is the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] whose co-founder [[Ellen G. White]] was a proponent of [[vegetarianism]]. Many Seventh-day Adventists avoid meat for health reasons, though vegetarianism is not a requirement. Members of the [[United Church of God]] as well as other Sabbath-keeping Christian Churches also believe in abstaining from unclean meats.  In their publication on the subject, they state that <blockquote style="background: #F0F0F0; border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em;">the Bible teaches that the distinction between clean and unclean has never been rescinded and that the distinction continues to exist for a good reason. http://www.gnmagazine.org/booklets/CU/ </blockquote>

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], it was forbidden to eat meat (defined as the flesh of any [[warm-blooded]] animal) on Friday, but as a [[penance]] to commemorate Christ's death rather than for meat's being regarded as "unclean" (exceptions are few, such as when [[Christmas]] falls on a Friday, in which case Thursday is the day of abstinence). After the [[Second Vatican Council]], the mandatory Friday abstinence from meat was limited to [[Lent]], although some traditionalist Catholics still maintain the abstinence year-round. In [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], both Friday and Wednesday were similarly considered off-limits. Many [[Protestants]] on the other hand have never observed the tradition, and may consider the tradition to be [[pagan]] in origin.

Some Christians believe that there is proof in the New Testament that the Apostle Paul and his close followers '''actually opposed''' Christ's teachings on the Law of Moses and that most modern Christians follow Paul's erroneous teachings. 

Seemingly proof of this can be found in many passages, for example Christ said, 

"17 <U+00B6>  Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till '''heaven and earth pass''', one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven." (Matthew 5:17-20)

The fact that Christ was circumcised and kept every tradition & feast of the Law of Moses - including the Passover - also strongly points to the fact that He expected future Christians to do the exact same thing. In fact there is no one quote of Christ in the entire New Testament where He clearly, explicitly 'does away with' or denounces the Law of His fellow practicing Jews.

==Scientific studies==
In [[1953]] [[David Macht|Dr. David I. Macht]], one of the primary proponents of [[biblical scientific foresight]], conducted [[toxin|toxicity]] tests on more than a hundred species of mammals, birds and fish.{{ref|macht4}} He reported that in every case, extracts from meat of unclean mammals, birds, and fish inhibited the growth of [[lupin]] seedlings more than those the Old Testament called [[clean animals|clean]].{{ref|macht1}} Macht's methodology, known as [[phytopharmacology]],{{ref|macht2}}{{ref|macht3}} has not been widely used by other researchers and is regarded as outdated and unreliable by modern mainstream science.

In [[1966]], [[United Kingdom|British]] [[anthropologist]] [[Mary Douglas]] published the influential study ''[[Purity and danger|Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo]]''. In ''Purity and Danger'', Douglas first proposed that the kosher laws were not, as many believed, either primitive [[Public health|health regulations]] or randomly chosen as tests of [[Jew]]s' commitment to [[God]]. Instead, Douglas argued that the laws were about keeping symbolic boundaries. Prohibited foods were those which did not seem to fall neatly into any category. Her theory was that pigs were declared unclean in Leviticus because pigs' place in the natural order was ambiguous since they shared the cloven hoof of the [[ungulate]]s, but did not chew [[cud]].

A [[1985]] study by Nanji and French{{ref|nanji}} found that there was a significant correlation between [[cirrhosis]] and pork consumption. Modern day swine raising is very different from earlier times with greater exposure to [[toxin]]s but reduced exposure to pests and disease.
