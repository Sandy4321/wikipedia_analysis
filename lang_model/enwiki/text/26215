The '''Chrysler VZ-6''' was an [[United States|American]] [[VTOL]] ducted-fan test vehicle designed and built by [[Chrysler]] for the United States Army ''Flying Jeep'' competition.<ref name="Andrade" /><ref name="aerofile" />

==Design and development==
Ordered in 1958 two VZ-6s were built, it was a rectangular-shaped vehicle with two three-bladed propellers inset at the front and back.<ref name="aerofile" /> The 500&nbsp;hp Lycoming engine was located in the centre driving the ducted fan propellers.<ref name="aerofile" /> It was also fitted with rubber skirts around the bottom edge of the vehicle similar to a hovercraft.<ref name="aerofile" />

==Operational history==
The VZ-6 started tethered flight tests in 1959, but these showed that the vehicle was overweight and underpowered with stability problems.<ref name="aerofile" /> An attempt at a non-tethered flight resulted in the VZ-6 flipping completely over writing off the vehicle but the pilot escaped without any serious injuries.<ref name="aerofile" /> Both VZ-6s were scrapped in 1960.<ref name="aerofile" />
