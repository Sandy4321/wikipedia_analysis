The '''64th Boat Race''' took place on 16 March 1907.  Held annually, the Boat Race is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]].  Cambridge were reigning champions, having won the [[The Boat Race 1906|previous year's race]], and more than half their crew had already participated in the event. In a race umpired by [[Frederick I. Pitman]], Cambridge won by four-and-a-half lengths in a time of 20 minutes 26 seconds.  It was their second consecutive victory and their fifth win in six races, taking the overall record in the event to 34&ndash;29 in Oxford's favour.

Cambridge were coached by Francis Escombe (for the fourth consecutive year), [[Stanley Muttlebury]], five-time Blue between 1886 and 1890, and David Alexander Wauchope (who had rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1895|1895 race]]).  Oxford's coaches were [[Harcourt Gilbey Gold]] (Dark Blue president for the [[The Boat Race 1900|1900 race]] and four-time Blue) and H. W. Willis.<ref>Burnell, pp. 110&ndash;111</ref>  The umpire for the fifth year was old [[Eton College|Etonian]] and former Cambridge rower [[Frederick I. Pitman]] who rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1884|1884]], [[The Boat Race 1885|1885]] and [[The Boat Race 1886|1886 races]].<ref>Burnell, pp. 49, 108</ref>

==Crews==
The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 12&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 2.875&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (77.3&nbsp;kg), {{convert|1.875|lb|kg|1}} per rower more than their opponents.<ref name=burn69>Burnell, p. 69</ref>  Oxford's crew contained three rowers with Boat Race experience, including [[Henry Bucknall]] who was rowing in his third consecutive event.  Cambridge saw five participants return to their boat, including [[Banner Johnstone]] who had rowed in both 1904 and 1906.<ref name=burn69/>  All of those taking part in the race were registered as British.<ref>Burnell, p. 39</ref>

Late in the previous summer, and following the [[Henley Royal Regatta]], Cambridge were challenged to a race along the Championship Course by [[Harvard University]]:  Cambridge won by two lengths.<ref>Drinkwater, pp. 117&ndash;118</ref>  The Light Blues made only two changes to personnel for this year's Boat Race, and as noted by author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater, "had a crew almost ready-made".<ref>Drinkwater, p. 118</ref>

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]] along which the Boat Race is contested]]
Oxford won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Cambridge.<ref name=burn69/>  Although the bend of the river provided the Dark Blues with an early advantage, Cambridge were ahead and clear within a minute and a half.  [[Stroke rate|Rating]] slightly slower than the Dark Blues, they passed the Mile Post two lengths up and held a three-length lead as they passed below [[Hammersmith Bridge]].  Oxford's stroke [[Sir Albert Gladstone, 5th Baronet|Albert Gladstone]] spurted in an attempt to draw his boat back into the contest, and stroke by stroke the gap was reduced, eventually to a few feet.<ref name=drink119>Drinkwater, p. 119</ref>
 
Encountering rough water, Oxford had to work hard to remain in contention but at Chiswick, began to fall back rapidly.  Even after reducing their stroke rate, Cambridge pulled further away to lead by four lengths at [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]].<ref name=drink119/>  They eased up to win by four-and-a-half lengths in a time of 20 minutes 26 seconds, their second consecutive victory and their fifth win in six races.  It was the largest winning margin since the [[The Boat Race 1904|1904 race]] and took the overall record in the event to 34&ndash;29 in Oxford's favour.<ref name=results/>
