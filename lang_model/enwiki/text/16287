The incident took place amid heavy fighting between the Israeli Defense Forces and [[Hezbollah]] during "[[Operation Grapes of Wrath]]". A United Nations investigation later determined it was unlikely that the Israeli shelling was a technical or procedural error.<ref name="kappen96">Franklin Van Kappen, ''[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.nsf/db942872b9eae454852560f6005a76fb/62d5aa740c14293b85256324005179be!OpenDocument Report ... of the Secretary-General's Military Adviser concerning the shelling of the United Nations compound at Qana on 18&nbsp;April 1996]'', 1 May 1996.</ref>

==Background==
[[Image:Qana memorial.jpg|px200|right|thumb|Memorial to the victims]]
In April 1996, a [[cease-fire]] that had ended the July 1993 fighting between [[Hezbollah]] and [[Israel]] broke down. During the five weeks of fighting between March 4 and April 10, seven Israeli soldiers, three Lebanese civilians and at least one Hezbollah fighter were killed. The tally of injured was sixteen Israeli soldiers, seven Lebanese civilians, and six Israeli civilians.<ref>''Lebanon: Main Events in Recent Hizbollah-Israel Violence'', ''[[Reuters]]'', April 11, 1996.</ref> On April 9, in response to the cease fire violations, Maj.-Gen. [[Amiram Levine]] declared: "The residents in south [[Lebanon]] who are under the responsibility of Hezbollah will be hit harder, and the Hezbollah will be hit harder, and we will find the way to act correctly and quickly."<ref>Shlomi Afriat, ''Israel vows retaliation for Lebanon rocket attacks'', Reuters, April 9, 1996.</ref> On April 11, after initial strikes against Hezbollah positions, Israel, through [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA) radio stations, warned residents in forty-four towns and villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate within twenty four hours.<ref>''"Israel Steps Up Lebanese Attacks," Washington Post, April 13, 1996, p. A23''</ref> 

A video recording made by a [[UNIFIL]] soldier of [[Force Mobile Reserve]] (FMR) showed an unmanned drone and two helicopters in the vicinity at the time of the shelling. An [[Israeli government]] spokesman confirmed there was a drone in the area, but stated that it did not detect civilians in the compound. The IDF initially and repeatedly claimed that no drone was flying in the area. The truth only emerged when the video clearly showed the presence of a drone.<ref>Robert Fisk- Pity the Nation, Lebanon at War</ref>

Within forty-eight hours, Israel launched [[Operation Grapes of Wrath]]. On April 11, Israel bombarded Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon and [[Beirut]], first with artillery and later laser guided missiles. On April 13, Israeli warships initiated a blockade against [[Beirut]], [[Sidon]] and [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], Lebanon's main ports of entry{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. Meanwhile, Hezbollah continuously bombarded northern Israel with [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] rockets. Israel continued to bomb Lebanon's infrastructures.

==Shelling of UN compound==
By 14 April,&nbsp;745 people were occupying the United Nations compound at Qana. More than 800 were there on April 18.<ref name="kappen96"/>Beginning with the second day of combat Israel had been retaliating within 10 minutes directly at any source of fire discovered by reconnaissance. This tactic was widely discussed in Israeli media, and well known to the Hezbollah fighters and Lebanese citizens. According to a [[U.N.]] report, on April 18, Hezbollah fighters fired two or three Katyusha rockets and between five and eight [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s at Israeli soldiers near the Red Line (the northern limits of the "security zone") from positions about 220 meters southwest and 350 meters southeast of the United Nations compound. 15 minutes later an Israeli unit responded by shelling the area with M-109A2 155&nbsp;mm guns.<ref name="kappen96"/>  According to the Israeli military, 38 shells were fired, two-thirds of them equipped with proximity fuses, an anti-personnel mechanism that causes the weapon to explode above the ground.

As a result of the shelling, 106 civilians died, with more wounded.

==Israeli response==
[[Image:Qana07.jpg|250px|thumb|right|UN Troops assemble victims of the shelling (This image is from an edited video supplied by [[Al Manar]] TV in [[Beirut]], April, 1996).]]
Israel immediately expressed regret for the loss of innocent lives, saying that the Hezbollah position and not the UN compound was the intended target of the shelling, and that the compound was hit "due to incorrect targeting based on erroneous data." Army Deputy Chief of Staff, [[Matan Vilnai]] stated that the shells hit the base not because they were off target, but because Israeli gunners used outdated maps of the area. He also stated that the gunners miscalculated the firing range of the shells.

Prime Minister [[Shimon Peres]] said, "We did not know that several hundred people were concentrated in that camp. It came to us as a bitter surprise."<ref>Serge Schmemann, ''Voicing Regret, Israeli Leader Offers a Cease-Fire'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 19, 1996.</ref> Following the attack, Lt.-Gen. [[Amnon Shahak]], Israel's chief of staff, at a press conference in [[Tel Aviv]] on April 18 defended the shelling:  "I don't see any mistake in judgment<U+2026>  We fought Hezbollah there [in Qana], and when they fire on us, we will fire at them to defend ourselves<U+2026>  I don't know any other rules of the game, either for the army or for civilians<U+2026>".<ref>''Israeli Army Chief Says UN Forewarned of Shelling'', Reuters, April 18, 1996.</ref>

Both the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Israel]] accused Hezbollah of "[[human shield|shielding]]", the use of civilians as a cover for military activities, which is a breach of the [[laws of war]]. The [[U.S. State Department]] spokesperson, [[Nicolas Burns]] stated, "Hezbollah [is] using civilians as cover.  That's a despicable thing to do, an evil thing."<ref>Steven Erlanger, ''Christopher Sees Syria Chief in Bid on Lebanon Truce'', The New York Times, April 21, 1996, quoting State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.</ref> and Prime Minister [[Shimon Peres]] cited the use of human shielding to blame Hezbollah. On April 18 he said, "They used them as a shield, they used the UN as a shield &mdash; the UN admitted it."<ref>''ICRC Condemns Shelling of Civilians in Southern Lebanon'', Communication to the press no. 96/14, April 19, 1996.</ref> Rabbi [[Yehuda Amital]], a member of Peres' cabinet, called the Qana killings a desecration of God's name (''chilul hashem'').<ref>''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'', 3 May 1996, p. 1 (quoted in Prior, M.

==UN investigation==
[[Image:UNIFIL Peacekeepers (Qana 1996) Remove Artillery Attack Victim Remains.jpg|thumb|UNIFIL peacekeepers remove the remains of artillery attack victims.]]
The UN appointed military advisor Major-General Franklin van Kappen of the Netherlands to investigate the incident. His conclusions were: (a) The distribution of impacts at Qana shows two distinct concentrations, whose mean points of impact are about 140 metres apart. If the guns were converged, as stated by the Israeli forces, there should have been only one main point of impact.
(b) The pattern of impacts is inconsistent with a normal overshooting of the declared target (the mortar site) by a few rounds, as suggested by the Israeli forces. (c) During the shelling, there was a perceptible shift in the weight of fire from the mortar site to the United Nations compound.
(d) The distribution of point impact detonations and air bursts makes it improbable that impact fuses and proximity fuses were employed in random order, as stated by the Israeli forces. (e) There were no impacts in the second target area which the Israeli forces claim to have shelled. (f) Contrary to repeated denials, two Israeli helicopters and a remotely piloted vehicle were present in the Qana area at the time of the shelling. While the possibility cannot be ruled out completely, it is unlikely that the shelling of the United Nations compound was the result of gross technical and/or procedural errors.<ref name="UN_S1996337_page6">{{UN document |docid=S-1996-337 |type=Document |body=Security Council |year=1996 |document_number=337 |highlight=rect_47,1018_949,1260 |page=6 |accessdate=2007-11-01| date=7 May 1996}}</ref>

==Israel's response to the report==
Israel issued the following response to the UN report: 1. Israel categorically rejects the findings of the UN report concerning the incident at Kana; 2. Israel profoundly regrets the loss of human life at Kana and has thoroughly investigated this tragic incident which was caused, first and foremost, by the firing of Katyusha rockets and mortars by Hizbullah from a location in close proximity to the UN position; We reiterate that the IDF had no intention whatsoever of firing on the UN position at Kana. Our investigation has shown that the UN position was hit by artillery fire due to incorrect targeting based on erroneous data. The IAF drone shown on videotape did not reach the area until after the UN position was hit and was not an operational component in the targeting of Israeli artillery fire in the area; 3. It is difficult to understand and highly regrettable that this report does not condemn Hizbullah for the cynical use of civilians as a shield for its gunmen, nor does it continue any condemnation of Hizbullah's use of areas contiguous or in close proximity to UN positions for launching attacks upon Israel; 4. This inaccurate and one sided report is misleading, runs contrary to the stated desire of the UN to play a more active role in the Middle East peace process and undermines its ability to do so. Israel hopes that the understanding reached between the various sides will engender the calm and stability necessary to engage the parties concerned in peace negotiations which are the only way to promote peace and security between Israel and Lebanon.

===Amnesty International report===
[[Amnesty International]] conducted an on-site investigation of the incident in collaboration with military experts, using interviews with UNIFIL staff and civilians in the compound, and posing questions to the IDF, who did not reply. Amnesty concluded, "the IDF intentionally attacked the UN compound, although the motives for doing so remain unclear. The IDF have failed to substantiate their claim that the attack was a mistake. Even if they were to do so they would still bear responsibility for killing so many civilians by taking the risk to launch an attack so close to the UN compound." <ref>http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE15/042/1996/en/dbadaf6a-eaf6-11dd-aad1-ed57e7e5470b/mde150421996en.pdf</ref>

Amnesty International could not establish with certainty whether or not the IDF knew that Lebanese civilians were sheltering in the compound when it was attacked. However, Israel knew  that UN positions are not legitimate targets and fact that the attack proceeded indicated a callous disregard for civilian lives and a breach of the laws of war on directly or indiscriminately targeting civilians.

Amnesty International said it was also clear that Hizbullah fired a mortar from a position within 200 metres of the periphery of the UN compound. All indications were that they were firing at an IDF patrol who had infiltrated north of the security zone and had apparently been laying mines. The intention of Hizbullah in choosing that location for the mortar was unclear; it might have been to shield themselves against an IDF counter-attack in the belief that the UN compound would be too close for the IDF to respond. Even if this was not the intention of Hizbullah, by taking up positions where they did they clearly were reckless as to the consequences this might have for the civilians in the immediate area. In either case, this was a clear breach of the laws of war prohibiting the use of civilian population as a shield.

==View of Human Rights Watch==
[[Human Rights Watch]] concurred, "The decision of those who planned the attack to choose a mix of high-explosive artillery shells that included deadly anti-personnel shells designed to maximize injuries on the ground <U+2014> and the sustained firing of such shells, without warning, in close proximity to a large concentration of civilians <U+2014> violated a key principle of international humanitarian law." <ref>{{cite web|url= http://hrw.org/reports/1997/isrleb/Isrleb.htm |title=Operation "Grapes of Wrath": The Civilian Victims|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|month=September|year=1997| accessdate=2006-07-20}}</ref>

==Lawsuit by relatives ==

On December 15, 2005, relatives of the victims filed suit in a [[Washington, DC]] court against former IDF Chief of Staff [[Moshe Yaalon]] for his role in the deaths. The lawsuit was prepared by the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]]. Yaalon, who was a visiting scholar in Washington, reportedly refused the papers serving the lawsuit.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1134309589087&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|title=Lawsuit filed against Ya'alon in US court|date=2005-12-15|accessdate=2006-07-13|publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]]|author=Guttman, Nathan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/legal/human_rights/docs/Complaint_Qana.pdf|format=PDF| title=Demand for Jury Trial|publisher=[[Center for Constitutional Rights|CCR]]|accessdate=2006-07-13|date= 2004-11-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060308233516/http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/legal/human_rights/docs/Complaint_Qana.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-03-08}}</ref> Among the plaintiffs named in the lawsuit are Saadallah Ali Belhas and his son Ali Belhas, who lost 31 family members in the raid, including their respective wives and 12 children.
