'''Roman Britain''' was the part of the [[British Isles|island of Great Britain]] controlled by the [[Roman Empire]] between AD 43 and about 410. 

The Romans referred to their territory as [[Britannia]], and it eventually consisted of all of the island south of the shifting frontier with [[Caledonia]]. Prior to the [[Roman invasion of Britain|Roman invasion]], [[British Iron Age|Iron Age Britain]] already had cultural and economic links with [[Continental Europe]], but the invaders introduced new developments in [[agriculture]], [[urbanisation]], [[industry]] and [[architecture]], leaving a legacy that is still apparent today. Historical records beyond the initial invasion are sparse, although many Roman historians mention Britannia in passing, and the names of many of its governors are known. Most knowledge of Roman Britain stems from [[archaeology|archaeological]] investigations and especially [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] evidence.

The first Romans to campaign extensively in Britain were the forces of [[Julius Caesar]] in 55 and 54 BC, but the first significant conquest did not begin until AD 43, under [[Claudius]]. The Romans established a [[Roman province|provincial government]] and steadily extended their control north, but were never able to exert firm control over [[Caledonia]]. Following the conquest of the native [[Britons (historical)|Britons]], a distinctive [[Romano-British culture]] emerged. The Romans cemented the province's northern border with [[Hadrian's Wall]], completed around 128. In 142, they pushed the frontier north to the [[Firth of Forth|Forth]]-[[Firth of Clyde|Clyde]] line, constructing the [[Antonine Wall]], but they retreated back to Hadrian's Wall after only twenty years. Around 197, Britannia was divided into two provinces, [[Britannia Superior]] and [[Britannia Inferior]]; in 293, it was subdivided even further and made into an imperial [[Roman diocese|diocese]]. For much of the later period, Britannia was subject to [[barbarian]] invasion and often came under the control of imperial [[Roman usurpers|usurpers]] and pretenders. The Romans largely [[Roman departure from Britain|departed from Britain]] around 410, leading to what is known as the [[sub-Roman Britain|sub-Roman period]], but the legacy of the empire was felt for hundreds of years.

==History==
===Early contact===
{{Main|Caesar's invasions of Britain}}
Britain was not unknown to the Classical world. As early as the 4th century BC, the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Phoenicia]]ns and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] traded for [[Cornwall|Cornish]] tin.<ref>George Patrick Welsh (1963), ''Britannia: the Roman Conquest and Occupation of Britain'' pp. 27-31</ref> The Greeks refer to the ''[[Cassiterides]]'', or "tin islands", and describe them as being situated somewhere near the west coast of Europe.<ref>[[Herodotus]], ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt.+3.115.1 3.115]</ref> The Carthaginian sailor [[Himilco the Navigator|Himilco]] is said to have visited the island in the 5th century BC and the Greek explorer [[Pytheas]] in the 4th. But it was regarded as a place of mystery, with some writers even refusing to believe it existed at all.<ref>Plutarch, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#23.2 Life of Caesar 23.2]</ref>

The first direct Roman contact came when the Roman general and future dictator, [[Julius Caesar]], made two expeditions to Britain in 55 and 54 BC as an offshoot of his conquest of [[Gaul]], believing the Britons had been helping the Gallic resistance. The first expedition, more a reconnaissance than a full invasion, gained a foothold on the coast of [[Kent]] but, undermined by storm damage to the ships and a lack of cavalry, was unable to advance further. The expedition was a military failure, but was at least a political success.  The [[Roman Senate]] declared a 20-day public holiday in Rome in honour of the unprecedented achievement of obtaining hostages from Britain and defeating Belgian tribes on returning to the continent.<ref>[[Julius Caesar]], ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' [[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 4#20|4.20-36]]</ref>

In his second invasion, Caesar took with him a substantially larger force and proceeded to coerce or invite many of the native Celtic tribes to pay tribute and give hostages in return for peace. A friendly local king, [[Mandubracius]], was installed, and his rival, [[Cassivellaunus]], was brought to terms. Hostages were taken, but historians disagree over whether the tribute agreed was paid by the Britons after Caesar's return to Gaul with his forces.<ref>Julius Caesar, ''Commentarii de Bello Gallico'' [[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 5#8|5.8-23]]</ref>

Caesar had conquered no territory and had left behind no troops, but had established [[cliens|clients]] on the island and had brought Britain into Rome's sphere of political influence. [[Augustus]] planned invasions in 34, 27 and 25 BC, but circumstances were never favourable,<ref>[[Dio Cassius]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/49*.html#38 49.38], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/53*.html#22 53.22], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/53*.html#25 53.25]</ref> and the relationship between Britain and Rome settled into one of diplomacy and trade. [[Strabo]], writing late in Augustus's reign, claims that taxes on trade brought in more annual revenue than any conquest could.<ref>[[Strabo]], ''Geography'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/4E*.html 4.5]</ref> Likewise, archaeology shows an increase in imported luxury goods in southeastern Britain.<ref>Keith Branigan (1987), ''The Catuvellauni''</ref> Strabo also mentions British kings who sent embassies to Augustus and Augustus' own ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]]'' refers to two British kings he received as refugees.<ref>[[Augustus]], ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Augustus/Res_Gestae/6*.html#32 32]</ref> When some of [[Tiberius]]'s ships were carried to Britain in a storm during his campaigns in [[Germania|Germany]] in AD 16, they were sent back by local rulers, telling tall tales of monsters.<ref>[[Tacitus]], ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' [[Wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#24|2.24]]</ref>

Rome appears to have encouraged a balance of power in southern Britain, supporting two powerful kingdoms: the [[Catuvellauni]], ruled by the descendants of [[Tasciovanus]], and the [[Atrebates]], ruled by the descendants of [[Commius]].<ref>John Creighton (2000), ''Coins and power in Late Iron Age Britain'', Cambridge University Press</ref> <br></br>This policy was followed until AD 39 or 40, when [[Caligula]] received an exiled member of the Catuvellaunian dynasty and staged an invasion of Britain that collapsed in farcical circumstances before it had even left Gaul.<ref>[[Suetonius]], ''Caligula'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#44 44-46]; Dio Cassius, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#25 59.25]</ref> When [[Claudius]] successfully invaded in AD 43, it was in aid of another fugitive British ruler, this time [[Verica]] of the Atrebates.

===Roman invasion===
{{Main|Roman conquest of Britain}}
The invasion force in AD 43 was led by [[Aulus Plautius]].<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#19 60.19-22]</ref> It is not known how many [[Roman legion]]s were sent; only one legion, the ''[[Legio II Augusta|II Augusta]]'', commanded by the future emperor [[Vespasian]], is directly attested to have taken part.<ref>Tacitus, ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 3#44|3.44]]</ref> The ''[[Legio VIIII Hispana|IX Hispana]]'',<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#32|14.32]]</ref> the ''[[Legio XIIII Gemina|XIV Gemina]]'' (later styled ''Martia Victrix'') and the ''[[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|XX]]'' (later styled ''Valeria Victrix'')<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#34|14.34]]</ref> are attested in 60/61 during the [[Boudica|Boudican Revolt]], and are likely to have been there since the initial invasion. However, the [[Roman Army]] was flexible, with units being used and moved whenever necessary, so this is not certain. Only the Legio IX Hispana is likely to have stayed there, as it is attested to being in residence at Eburacum (York) in AD 71 and on a building inscription there dated AD 108, before its eventual destruction fighting in the East, likely during the Bar Kochba Revolt.<ref>Webster, Graham ''The Roman Imperial Army of the first and second centuries A.D.'' University of Oklahomah Press New ed of 3 Revised ed 1998 ISBN 978-0806130002 p.66 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=v0f4SEf7rosC&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=Legio+IX+Hispana+108+stamps&source=bl&ots=joPevZS3Ju&sig=nU-ybnbeeWYnnuU4CunczFevYZA&hl=en&ei=i6D4SdXBHcXPjAfu8tnADA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1]</ref>

The invasion was delayed by a mutiny of the troops, who were eventually persuaded by an imperial freedman to overcome their fear of crossing the [[Oceanus|Ocean]] and campaigning beyond the limits of the known world. They sailed in three divisions, and probably landed at [[Richborough]] in [[Kent]], although some suggest that at least part of the invasion force landed on the south coast, in the [[Fishbourne, West Sussex|Fishbourne]] area of [[West Sussex]].<ref>For example, John Manley, ''AD 43: The Roman Invasion of Britain: a Reassessment'', 2002.</ref>

The Romans defeated the Catuvellauni and their allies in two battles: the first, assuming a Richborough landing, [[Battle of the Medway|on the river Medway]], the second on the [[Thames]]. One of the Catuvellaunian leaders, [[Togodumnus]], was killed, but his brother [[Caratacus]] survived to continue resistance elsewhere. Plautius halted at the Thames and sent for Claudius, who arrived with reinforcements, including artillery and elephants, for the final march to the Catuvellaunian capital, [[Camulodunum]] ([[Colchester]]). The future emperor [[Vespasian]] subdued the southwest,<ref>Suetonius, ''Vespasian'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html#4 4]</ref> [[Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus|Cogidubnus]] was set up as a friendly king of several territories,<ref>Tacitus, ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'' [[Wikisource:Agricola#14|14]]</ref> and treaties were made with tribes outside the area under direct Roman control.

===Roman rule is established===
{{See|Romano-British culture}}
[[File:Roman Roads in Britannia.svg|thumb|300px|Roman province of '''Britannia''' in 125 AD, showing native tribes, cities, main roads and [[Roman legions|legions]] deployed]]
After capturing the south of the island, the Romans turned their attention to what is now Wales. The [[Silures]], [[Ordovices]] and [[Deceangli]] remained implacably opposed to the invaders and for the first few decades were the focus of Roman military attention, despite occasional minor revolts among Roman allies like the [[Brigantes]] and the [[Iceni]]. The Silures were led by [[Caratacus]], and he carried out an effective [[guerilla warfare|guerilla]] campaign against Governor [[Publius Ostorius Scapula]]. Finally, in 51 AD, Ostorius lured Caratacus into a set-piece battle and defeated him. The British leader sought refuge among the Brigantes, but their queen, [[Cartimandua]], proved her loyalty by surrendering him to the Romans. He was brought as a captive to Rome, where a dignified speech he made during Claudius's triumph persuaded the emperor to spare his life. However, the Silures were still not pacified, and Cartimandua's ex-husband [[Venutius]] replaced Caratacus as the most prominent leader of British resistance.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+12.31 12:31-38]</ref>

In 60-61 AD, while Governor [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]] was campaigning in Wales, the southeast of Britain rose in revolt under the leadership of [[Boudica]]. Boudica was the widow of the recently-deceased king of the Iceni, Prasutagus. The Roman historian Tacitus reports that Prasutagus had left a will leaving half his kingdom to [[Nero]] in the hope that the remainder would be left untouched. He was wrong. When his will was enforced, Rome responded by violently seizing the tribe's lands in full. Boudica protested. In consequence, Rome punished her and her daughters by flogging and rape. In response, the Iceni, joined by the [[Trinovantes]], destroyed the Roman colony at Camulodunum ([[Colchester]]) and routed the part of the IXth legion that was sent to relieve it. Suetonius Paulinus rode to London, the rebels' next target, but concluded it could not be defended. Abandoned, it was destroyed, as was [[Verulamium]] (St Albans). Between seventy and eighty thousand people are said to have been killed in the three cities. But Suetonius regrouped with two of the three legions still available to him, chose a battlefield, and, despite being heavily outnumbered, defeated the rebels in the [[Battle of Watling Street]]. Boudica died not long afterwards, by self-administered poison or by illness.<ref>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[Wikisource:Agricola#14|14-17]], ''Annals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+14.29 14.29-39]; Dio Cassius, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62*.html#1 62.1-12]</ref> During this time, the Emperor Nero considered withdrawing Roman forces from Britain altogether.<ref>Suetonius, ''Nero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#18 18]</ref>

There was further turmoil in 69 AD, the "[[year of four emperors]]". As civil war raged in Rome, weak governors were unable to control the legions in Britain, and Venutius of the Brigantes seized his chance. The Romans had previously defended Cartimandua against him, but this time were unable to do so. Cartimandua was evacuated, and Venutius was left in control of the north of the country. After Vespasian secured the empire, his first two appointments as governor, [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]] and [[Sextus Julius Frontinus]], took on the task of subduing the Brigantes and Silures respectively.<ref>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[Wikisource:Agricola#16|16-17]]; ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' [[Wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#60|1.60]], [[Wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 3#45|3.45]]</ref> Frontinus extended Roman rule to all of [[South Wales]], and initiated exploitation of the mineral resources, such as the [[gold mine]]s at [[Dolaucothi]].
[[File:Agricola.Campaigns.80.84.jpg|frameless|left|240px]]
In the following years, the Romans conquered more of the island, increasing the size of Roman Britain. Governor [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], father-in-law to the historian [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]], conquered the [[Ordovices]] in 78 AD. With the [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|XXth ''Valeria Victrix'']] legion, Agricola defeated the [[Caledonians]] in 84 AD at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]], in northern Scotland.<ref>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[Wikisource:Agricola#18|18-38]]</ref> This was the high water mark of Roman territory in Britain: shortly after his victory, Agricola was recalled from Britain back to Rome, and the Romans retired to a more defensible line along the [[Firth of Forth|Forth]]-[[Firth of Clyde|Clyde]] isthmus, freeing soldiers badly needed along other frontiers.

For much of the history of Roman Britain, a large number of soldiers were garrisoned on the island. This required that the emperor station a trusted senior man as governor of the province. As a result, many future emperors served as governors or legates in this province, including [[Vespasian]], [[Pertinax]], and [[Gordian I]].

===Occupation and retreat from southern Scotland===
[[File:Roman.Scotland.north.84.jpg|frameless|right|260px]]
There is no historical source describing the decades that followed Agricola's recall.  Even the name of his replacement is unknown. Archaeology has shown that some [[Roman forts]] south of the Forth-Clyde isthmus were rebuilt and enlarged, although others appear to have been abandoned. Roman coins and pottery have been found circulating at native settlement sites in the [[Scottish Lowlands]] in the years before 100 AD, indicating growing [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanisation]]. Some of the most important sources for this era are the writing tablets from the fort at [[Vindolanda]] in [[Northumberland]], mostly dating to AD 90-110. These tablets provide vivid evidence for the operation of a Roman fort at the edge of the Roman Empire, where officers' wives maintained polite society while merchants, hauliers and military personnel kept the fort operational and supplied.

Around 105 AD, however, there appears to have been a serious setback at the hands of the tribes of the [[Picts]] of [[Alba]]: several Roman forts were destroyed by fire, with human remains and damaged [[armour]] at ''[[Trimontium (Newstead)|Trimontium]]'' (at modern [[Newstead, Scottish Borders|Newstead]], in SE Scotland) indicating hostilities at least at that site. There is also circumstantial evidence that auxiliary reinforcements were sent from Germany, and an unnamed British war of the period is mentioned on the gravestone of a [[tribune]] of [[Cyrene (mythology)|Cyrene]]. However, [[Trajan's Dacian Wars]] may have led to troop reductions in the area or even total withdrawal followed by slighting of the forts by the Picts rather than an unrecorded military defeat. The Romans were also in the habit of destroying their own forts during an orderly withdrawal, in order to deny resources to an enemy. In either case, the frontier probably moved south to the line of the [[Stanegate]] at the [[Solway Firth|Solway]]-[[River Tyne|Tyne]] isthmus around this time.

[[File:Hadrians Wall from Housesteads1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hadrian's Wall]] viewed from [[Vercovicium]]]]
A new crisis occurred at the beginning of [[Hadrian]]'s reign (117 AD): a rising in the north which was suppressed by [[Quintus Pompeius Falco]]. When Hadrian reached Britannia on his famous tour of the Roman provinces around 120 AD, he directed an extensive defensive wall, known to posterity as [[Hadrian's Wall]], to be built close to the line of the Stanegate frontier. Hadrian appointed [[Aulus Platorius Nepos]] as governor to undertake this work who brought the [[Legio VI Victrix|VIth ''Victrix'']] legion with him from [[Lower Germany]]. This replaced the famous [[Legio IX Hispana|IXth ''Hispana'']] legion, whose disappearance has been much discussed. Archaeology indicates considerable political instability in Scotland during the first half of the second century, and the shifting frontier at this time should be seen in this context.

In the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]] (138-161 AD) the Hadrianic border was briefly extended north to the Forth-Clyde isthmus, where the [[Antonine Wall]] was built around 142 AD following the military reoccupation of the Scottish lowlands by a new governor, [[Quintus Lollius Urbicus]].
{{Clear}}
[[File:Roman.Scotland.north.155.jpg|frameless|right|260px]]
The first Antonine occupation of Scotland ended as a result of a further crisis in 155-157 AD, when the [[Brigantes]] revolted. With limited options to despatch reinforcements, the Romans moved their troops south, and this rising was suppressed by Governor [[Cnaeus Julius Verus]]. Within a year the Antonine Wall was recaptured, but by 163 or 164 AD it was abandoned. The second occupation was probably connected with Antonius' undertakings to protect the Votadini or his pride in enlarging the empire, since the retreat to the Hadrianic frontier occurred not long after his death when a more objective strategic assessment of the benefits of the Antonine Wall could be made. The Romans did not entirely withdraw from Scotland at this time, however: the large fort at Newstead was maintained along with seven smaller outposts until at least 180 AD.

During the twenty year period following the reversion of the frontier to Hadrian's Wall, Rome was concerned with continental issues, primarily problems in the [[Danube]] provinces. Increasing numbers of [[hoard]]s of buried coins in Britain at this time indicate that peace was not entirely achieved. Sufficient Roman silver has been found in Scotland to suggest more than ordinary trade, and it is likely that the Romans were reinforcing [[treaty]] agreements by paying tribute to their implacable enemies, the Picts. 

In 175 AD a large force of [[Sarmatian]] cavalry, consisting of 5,500 men, arrived in Britannia, probably to reinforce troops fighting unrecorded uprisings. In 180 AD Hadrian's Wall was breached by the Picts and the commanding officer or governor was killed there in what [[Dio Cassius]] described as the most serious war of the reign of [[Commodus]]. [[Ulpius Marcellus]] was sent as replacement governor and by 184 AD he had won a new peace, only to be faced with a mutiny from his own troops. Unhappy with Marcellus' strictness, they tried to elect a legate named [[Caerellius Priscus|Priscus]] as usurper governor; he refused, but Marcellus was lucky to leave the province alive. The Roman army in Britannia continued its insubordination: they sent a delegation of 1,500 to Rome to demand the execution of [[Tigidius Perennis]], a [[Praetorian Prefect]] who they felt had earlier wronged them by posting lowly [[equites]] to legate ranks in Britannia. Commodus met the party outside Rome and agreed to have Perennis killed, but this only made them feel more secure in their mutiny.

The future emperor [[Pertinax]] was sent to Britannia to quell the mutiny and was initially successful in regaining control. However, a riot broke out among the troops. Pertinax was attacked and left for dead, and asked to be recalled to Rome, where he briefly succeeded Commodus as emperor in 192 AD.

===Third century===
The death of Commodus put into motion a series of events which eventually led to civil war. Following the short reign of Pertinax, several rivals for the throne emerged, including [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Clodius Albinus]]. The latter was the new governor of Britannia, and had seemingly won the natives over after their earlier rebellions; he also controlled three legions, making him a potentially significant claimant. His sometime rival Severus promised him the title of ''Caesar'' in return for Albinus' support against [[Pescennius Niger]] in the east. Once Niger was neutralised however, Severus turned on his ally in Britannia<U+2014>though it is likely that Albinus saw he would be the next target and was already preparing for war.

Albinus crossed to [[Gaul]] in 195 AD, where the provinces were also sympathetic to him, and set up at [[Lugdunum]]. Severus arrived in February 196, and the ensuing battle was decisive. Although Albinus came close to victory, Severus' reinforcements won the day, and the British governor committed suicide. Severus soon purged Albinus' sympathisers and perhaps confiscated large tracts of land in Britain as punishment. 

Albinus had demonstrated the major problem posed by Roman Britain. In order to maintain security, the province required the presence of three legions; but these provided an ambitious man, whose loyalty to the emperor was weak, with a powerful base for rebellion. Deploying those legions elsewhere, however, would strip the island of its garrison, leaving the province defenceless against uprisings by the native Celtic tribes and against invasion by the [[Picts]] and [[Gaels|Scots]].

The traditional view is that northern Britain descended into anarchy during Albinus' absence. [[Cassius Dio]] records that the new Governor, [[Virius Lupus]], was obliged to buy peace from a fractious northern tribe known as the [[Maeatae]]. The succession of militarily distinguished governors who were subsequently appointed suggests that enemies of Rome were posing a difficult challenge, and [[Lucius Alfenus Senecio]]'s report to Rome in 207 AD describes barbarians "rebelling, over-running the land, taking loot and creating destruction". In order to rebel, of course, one must be a subject - although the Maeatae clearly did not consider themselves such. Senecio requested either reinforcements or an Imperial expedition, and Severus chose the latter, despite being 62 years old.

Archaeological evidence shows that Senecio had been rebuilding the defences of Hadrian's Wall and the forts beyond it, and Severus' arrival in Britain prompted the enemy tribes to sue for peace immediately. The emperor had not come all that way to leave without a victory, however, and it is likely that he wished to provide his teenage sons [[Caracalla]] and [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] with first-hand experience of controlling a hostile barbarian land.
[[File:Roman.Britain.Severan.Campaigns.jpg|frameless|right|260px]]
An expedition led by Severus and probably numbering around 20,000 troops moved north in AD 208 or 209, crossing the Wall and passing through eastern Scotland on a route similar to that used by Agricola. Harried by punishing guerrilla raids by the northern tribes and slowed by an unforgiving terrain, Severus was unable to meet the Caledonians on a battlefield. The emperor's forces pushed north as far as the [[River Tay]], but little appears to have been achieved by the invasion, as peace treaties were signed with the Caledonians. By 210 Severus had returned to York, and the frontier had once again become Hadrian's Wall. He assumed the title ''Britannicus'', but the title meant little with regard to the unconquered north, which (with Rome's power still ending at the Wall) clearly remained outside the authority of the Empire. And almost immediately another northern tribe, the Maeatae, again went to war. Caracalla left with a [[punitive expedition]], but by the following year his ailing father had died and he and his brother left the province to press their claim to the throne.

As one of his last acts, Severus tried to solve the problem of powerful and rebellious governors in Britain by dividing the province into [[Britannia Superior|Upper Britain]] and [[Britannia Inferior|Lower Britain]]. This kept the potential for rebellion in check for almost a century. Historical sources provide little information on the following decades, a period known as the Long Peace. Even so, the number of buried hoards found from this period rises, suggesting continuing unrest. A string of forts were built along the coast of southern Britain to control piracy; and over the following hundred years they increased in number, becoming the [[Saxon Shore Forts]].

During the middle of the 3rd century AD, the Roman Empire was convulsed by barbarian invasions, rebellions and new imperial pretenders. Except the intensification of the [[Frisians|Frisian]] settlements on the North Sea coast (with the approbation of the Roman authorities to protect the area against the Caledonian raids), Britannia apparently avoided these troubles, although increasing [[inflation]] had its economic effect. In 259 a so-called [[Gallic Empire]] was established when [[Postumus]] rebelled against [[Gallienus]]. Britannia was part of this until 274 when [[Aurelian]] reunited the empire.

In the late 270s a half-[[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] usurper named [[Bonosus (usurper)|Bononus]] rebelled to avoid the repercussions of letting his fleet be burnt by barbarians at [[Cologne]]. He was quickly crushed by [[Probus]], but soon afterwards an unnamed governor in Britannia also attempted an uprising. Irregular troops of [[Vandal]]s and [[Burgundians]] were sent across the Channel by Probus to put down the uprising, perhaps in 278 AD.

The last of the string of rebellions to affect Britannia was that of [[Carausius]] and his successor [[Allectus]]. Carausius was a naval commander, probably in the [[English Channel]].  He was accused of keeping pirate booty for himself, and his execution was ordered by the Emperor [[Maximian]].  In 286 AD he set himself up as emperor in Britain and northern Gaul and remained in power whilst Maximian dealt with uprisings elsewhere. In 288 an invasion failed to unseat the usurper. An uneasy peace ensued, during which Carausius issued coins proclaiming his legitimacy and inviting official recognition.

In 293 AD [[Constantius Chlorus]] launched a second offensive, besieging the rebel's port at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] and cutting it off from naval assistance. After the town fell, Constantius tackled Carausius' [[Franks|Frankish]] allies. Subsequently the usurper was murdered by his treasurer, [[Allectus]]. Allectus' brief reign was brought to an end when [[Julius Asclepiodotus]] landed near [[Southampton]] and defeated him in a land battle.<ref>''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' 8, 10; [[Aurelius Victor]], ''Book of Caesars'' [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#39 39]; [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Abridgement of Roman History'' [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans9.html#21 21-22]; [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], ''Seven Books of History Against the Pagans [http://www.attalus.org/latin/orosius7A.html#25 7.25]</ref>

Constantius arrived in London to receive the victory and chose to divide the province further, into four provinces (each with its own governor):
*[[Maxima Caesariensis]] (based on London), from Upper Britannia 
*[[Britannia Prima]], from Upper Britannia 
*[[Flavia Caesariensis]], from Lower Britannia
*[[Britannia Secunda]], from Lower Britannia

In the same year, under the [[Tetrarchy]] reforms of the emperor [[Diocletian]], Britannia became one of the four dioceses<U+2014>governed by a ''vicarius''<U+2014>of the praetorian prefecture of [[Galliae]] ('the Gauls'), comprising the provinces of Gaul, Britannia, [[Germania]] and [[Hispania]]. This added, in effect, a fifth governor of Britannia. Thus, in place of one unchallenged military commander, the province now had five officers, each with command of only a small fraction of the garrison.

===Fourth century===
Constantius Chlorus returned in 306 AD, aiming to invade northern Britain. The province's defences had been rebuilt in the preceding years, and although his health was poor Constantius wished to penetrate into enemy territory. Little is known of his campaigns, and there is little archaeological evidence for them. From fragmentary historical sources it seems he reached the far north of Britain and won a great battle in early summer before returning south to [[York]].

Constantius remained in Britain for the rest of the time he was part of the Tetrarchy, dying in York in July 306 AD. His son, [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]], was at his side at that moment and assumed his duties in Britannia. Unlike the earlier usurper, Albinus, he succeeded in using his base in Britannia as the starting point of his march to the imperial throne.

In the middle of the century, for a few years the province was loyal to the usurper [[Magnentius]], who succeeded [[Constans]] following the latter's death. After the defeat and death of Magnentius in the [[Battle of Mons Seleucus]] in 353 AD, [[Constantius II]] dispatched his chief imperial notary [[Paul "Catena"]] to Britain to hunt down Magnentius' supporters. The investigation deteriorated into a [[Witch-hunt|witch hunt]], which forced the ''vicarius'' [[Flavius Martinus]] to intervene. When Paul retaliated by accusing Martinus of treason, the ''vicarius'' physically attacked Paul with a sword, with the aim of assassinating him, but in the end he committed suicide.

As the 4th century progressed there were increasing attacks from the [[Saxon people|Saxons]] in the east and the Irish in the west. A series of forts was already being built, starting around 280 AD, to defend the coasts, but these preparations were not enough when a general assault of Saxons, Irish and [[Attacotti]], combined with apparent dissension in the garrison on Hadrian's Wall, left Roman Britain prostrate in 367 AD. This crisis, sometimes called the Barbarian Conspiracy or the [[Great Conspiracy]], was settled by [[Count Theodosius]] with a string of military and civil reforms.

Another imperial usurper, [[Magnus Maximus]], raised the standard of revolt at [[Segontium Roman Fort|Segontium]] (Caernarfon) in north Wales in 383 AD, and crossed the [[English Channel]]. Maximus held much of the western empire, and fought a successful campaign against the [[Picts]] and [[Scoti|Scots]] around 384. His continental exploits required troops from Britain, and it appears that forts at Chester and elsewhere were abandoned in this period, triggering raids and settlement in north Wales by the Irish. His rule was ended in 388, but not all the British troops may have returned: the Empire's military resources were struggling after the catastrophic [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378. Around 396 there were increasing barbarian incursions into Britain, and an expedition - possibly led by [[Stilicho]] - brought naval action against the raiders. It seems peace was restored by 399, although it is likely that no further garrisoning was ordered; and indeed by 401 more troops were withdrawn, to assist in the war against [[Alaric I]].

===End of Roman rule===
{{Main|Roman departure from Britain}}
[[File:Brittain 410.jpg|thumb|300px|Roman Britain in 410.]]
The traditional view of historians, informed by the work of [[Michael Rostovtzeff]], was of a widespread economic decline at the beginning of the fifth century.  However, consistent archaeological evidence has told another story, and the accepted view is undergoing re-evaluation.  The abandonment of some sites is now believed to be later than had formerly been thought.  Many buildings changed use but were not destroyed. There were growing barbarian attacks, but these were focused on vulnerable rural settlements rather than towns.  Some villas such as [[Great Casterton]] in [[Rutland]] and [[Hucclecote]] in [[Gloucestershire]] had new mosaic floors laid around this time, suggesting that economic problems may have been limited and patchy, although many suffered some decay before being abandoned in the fifth century; the story of [[Saint Patrick]] indicates that villas were still occupied until at least 430. New buildings were still going up in this period in [[Verulamium]] and [[Cirencester]]. Some urban centres, for example [[Canterbury]], [[Cirencester]], [[Wroxeter]], [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]] and [[Gloucester]], remained active during the fifth and sixth centuries, surrounded by large farming estates.  

Urban life had generally grown less intense by the fourth quarter of the fourth century, and coins minted between 378 and 388 are very rare, indicating a likely combination of economic decline, diminishing numbers of troops, and problems with the payment of soldiers and officials. Coinage circulation increased during the 390s, although it never attained the levels of earlier decades. Copper coins are very rare after 402, although minted silver and gold coins from hoards indicate they were still present in the province even if they were not being spent. By 407 there were no new Roman coins going into circulation, and by 430 it is likely that coinage as a medium of exchange had been abandoned. Pottery mass production probably ended a decade or two previously; the rich continued to use metal and glass vessels, while the poor probably adopted leather or wooden ones.

===Sub-Roman Britain===
{{Main|Sub-Roman Britain}}
Britain came under increasing pressure from [[barbarian]] attack on all sides towards the end of the 4th century, and troops were too few to mount an effective defence. The army rebelled and, after elevating two disappointing [[usurp]]ers, chose a soldier, [[Constantine III (usurper)|Constantine III]], to become emperor in 407. He soon crossed to Gaul with an army and was defeated by [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]]; it is unclear how many troops remained or ever returned, or whether a commander-in-chief in Britain was ever reappointed. A [[Saxons|Saxon]] incursion in 408 was apparently repelled by the [[Britons (historic)|Britons]], and in 409 [[Zosimus]] records that the natives expelled the Roman civilian administration (although Zosimus may be referring to the Bacaudic rebellion of the Breton inhabitants of Armorica since he describes how, in the aftermath of the revolt, all of Armorica and the rest of Gaul followed the example of the Brettaniai). A later appeal for help by the British communities was rejected by the Emperor [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]] in 410. This apparent contradiction has been explained by EA Thompson as a peasant revolt against the landowning classes, with the latter group asking for Roman help; an uprising certainly occurred in Gaul at the time. With the higher levels of the military and civil government gone, administration and justice fell to municipal authorities, and small warlords gradually emerged all over Britain, still aspiring to Roman ideals and conventions. Laycock (Britannia the Failed State, 2008) has investigated this process of fragmentation and emphasised elements of continuity from the British tribes in the pre-Roman and Roman periods to the kingdoms that formed in the post-Roman period. 

By tradition, the pagan Saxons were invited by [[Vortigern]] to assist in fighting the [[Picts]] and Irish, though archaeology has suggested some official settlement as landed mercenaries as early as the third century. Germanic migration into Roman Britannia may well have begun much earlier even than that. There is recorded evidence, for example, of Germanic [[Roman auxiliaries]] being brought to Britain in the first and second centuries to support the legions. The new arrivals rebelled, plunging the country into a series of wars that eventually led to the Saxon occupation of Lowland Britain by 600. Around this time many Britons fled to [[Brittany]] (hence its name). Similar orders were sent out in the 490s but met with no response. A significant date in sub-Roman Britain is the famous [[Groans of the Britons]], an unanswered appeal to [[Flavius A<U+00EB>tius|A<U+00EB>tius]], leading general of the western Empire, for assistance against Saxon invasion in 446; another is the [[Battle of Dyrham]] in 577, after which the significant cities of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Cirencester]] and [[Gloucester]] fell and the Saxons reached the western sea. 

Most scholars reject the historicity of the later [[legend]]s of [[King Arthur]], which seem to be set in this period, but some such as [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]] see it as evidence behind which may lie a plausible grain of truth.

==Themes==
===Trade and industry===
{{See|Mining in Roman Britain}}
[[File:Dolaucothimap4.jpg|thumb|300px|Development of mine]]
By the time of the Roman occupation, Britain's tin exports to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] had been largely eclipsed by the more convenient supply from [[Hispania]]. [[Gold]], tin, iron, lead, silver, jet, marble and pearls however were all exploited by the Romans in Britain along with more everyday commodities such as hunting dogs, animal skins, timber, wool and slaves. Foreign investment created a vigorous domestic market, and imports to Roman Britain were often of exotic continental items such as fine pottery such as [[Samian]], olive oil, lavastone [[quern-stone|querns]], fine glassware, wines, [[garum]] and fruit.

Mineral extraction sites such as the [[Dolaucothi Gold Mines|Dolaucothi gold mine]] was probably first worked by the Roman army from ca 75 AD, and at some later stage passed to civilian operators. The mine developed as a series of opencast workings, mainly by the use of [[hydraulic mining]] methods. They are described by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his [[Naturalis Historia]] in great detail. Essentially, water supplied by [[aqueduct]]s was used to prospect for ore veins by stripping away soil to reveal the [[bedrock]]. If veins were present, they were attacked using [[fire-setting]] and the ore removed for crushing and [[comminution]]. The dust was washed in a small stream of water and the heavy gold dust and [[gold nugget]]s collected in riffles. The diagram at right shows how Dolaucothi developed from ca 75 AD through to the first century. When opencast work was no longer feasible, tunnels were driven to follow the veins. The evidence from the site shows advanced technology probably under the control of army engineers.  

The [[Weald]]en ironworking zone, the lead and silver mines of the [[Mendip Hills]] and the tin mines of Cornwall seem to have been private enterprises leased from the government for a fee. Although mining had long been practised in Britain (see [[Grimes Graves]]), the Romans introduced new technical knowledge and large-scale industrial production to revolutionise the industry. It included [[hydraulic mining]] to prospect for ore by removing overburden as well as work alluvial deposits. The water needed for such large-scale operations was supplied by one or more [[aqueduct]]s, those surviving at Doalucothi being especially impressive. Many prospecting areas were in dangerous, [[highland (geography)|upland]] country, and, although mineral exploitation was presumably one of the main reasons for the Roman invasion, it had to wait until these areas were subdued.

Although Roman designs were most popular, rural craftsmen still produced items derived from the [[Iron Age]] [[La T<U+00E8>ne culture|La T<U+00E8>ne]] artistic traditions. Local pottery rarely attained the standards of the Gaulish industries although the [[Castor ware]] of the [[Nene Valley]] was able to withstand comparison with the imports. Most native pottery was unsophisticated however and intended only for local markets.

By the third century, Britain's economy was diverse and well-established, with commerce extending into the non-Romanised north. The design of [[Hadrian's Wall]] especially catered to the need for customs inspections of merchants' goods.

===Provincial government===
Under the Roman Empire, administration of peaceful provinces was ultimately the remit of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], but those, like Britain, that required permanent garrisons were placed under the Emperor's control. In practice imperial provinces were run by resident [[Roman governor|governors]] who were members of the Senate and had held the [[Roman consul|consulship]]. These men were carefully selected often having strong records of military success and administrative ability. In Britain, a governor's role was primarily military, but numerous other tasks were also his responsibility such as maintaining diplomatic relations with local client kings, building roads, ensuring the public courier system functioned, supervising the [[civitates]] and acting as a judge in important legal cases. When not campaigning he would travel the province hearing complaints and recruiting new troops.

To assist him in legal matters he had an adviser, the ''legatus iuridicus'', and those in Britain appear to have been distinguished lawyers perhaps because of the challenge of incorporating tribes into the imperial system and devising a workable method of taxing them. Financial administration was dealt with by a ''[[Promagistrate|procurator]]'' with junior posts for each tax-raising power. Each legion in Britain had a commander who answered to the governor and in time of war probably directly ruled troublesome districts. Each of these commands carried a tour of duty of two to three years in different provinces.  Below these posts was a network of administrative managers covering intelligence gathering, sending reports to Rome, organising military supplies and dealing with prisoners. A staff of seconded soldiers provided clerical services.

Colchester was probably the earliest capital of Roman Britain, but it was soon eclipsed by London with its strong mercantile connections.

===Religion===
====Pagan====
The [[druid]]s, the Celtic priestly caste who were believed to originate in Britain,<ref>Julius Caesar, ''Commentarii de Bello Gallico'' [[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 6#13|6.13]]</ref> were outlawed by [[Claudius]],<ref>Suetonius, ''Claudius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#25.5 12.5]</ref> and in 61 they vainly defended their [[sacred grove]]s from destruction by the Romans on the island of Mona ([[Anglesey]]).<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+14.30 14.30]</ref> However, under Roman rule the Britons continued to worship native Celtic deities, such as [[Ancasta]], but often conflated with their Roman equivalents, like [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] Rigonemetos at [[Nettleham]]. 

The degree to which earlier native beliefs survived is difficult to gauge precisely. Certain European ritual traits such as the significance of the number 3, the importance of the head and of water sources such as [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] remain in the archaeological record, but the differences in the [[votive offering]]s made at the [[Roman Baths (Bath)]], [[Bath, Somerset]] before and after the Roman conquest suggest that continuity was only partial. Worship of the [[Roman Emperor]] is widely recorded, especially at military sites. The founding of a [[Roman temple]] to [[Temple of Claudius, Colchester|Claudius]] at [[Camulodunum]] was one of the impositions that led to the revolt of [[Boudica]]. By the third century [[Pagans Hill Roman Temple]] in Somerset was able to exist peaceably into the 5th century.

Eastern cults such as [[Mithraism]] also grew in popularity towards the end of the occupation. The [[Temple of Mithras, London|Temple of Mithras]] is one example of the popularity of [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religion]]s amongst the rich urban classes and temples to Mithras also exist in military contexts at [[Vindobala]] on [[Hadrians Wall]] (the [[Rudchester Mithraeum]]) and at [[Segontium]] in [[Roman Wales]] (the [[Caernarfon Mithraeum]]).

====Christianity====
It is not clear when or how Christianity came to Britain. A 2nd century [[sator square|"word square"]] has been discovered in [[Mamucium]], the Roman settlement of [[Manchester]]. It consists of an anagram of [[Lord's Prayer|PATER NOSTER]] carved on a piece of [[amphora]]. There has been discussion by academics whether the "word square" is actually a Christian artefact, but if it is, it is one of the earliest examples of [[early Christianity]] in Britain.<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Shotter |date=[2004] 1993 |title=Romans and Britons in North-West England |publisher=Centre for North-West Regional Studies |pages=129<U+2013>130 |location=Lancaster |isbn=1-86220-152-8}}</ref> The earliest confirmed written evidence for Christianity in Britain is a statement by [[Tertullian]], c. 200 AD, in which he described "all the limits of the Spains, and the diverse nations of the Gauls, and the haunts of the Britons, inaccessible to the Romans, but subjugated to Christ".<ref>[[Tertullian]], ''Adversus Judaeos'' [http://www.tertullian.org/anf/anf03/anf03-19.htm#P2141_725966 7.4]</ref> Archaeological evidence for Christian communities begins to appear in the 3rd and 4th centuries. Small timber churches are suggested at [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Silchester]] and [[baptismal font]]s have been found at [[Icklingham]] and the [[Saxon Shore Forts|Saxon Shore Fort]] at [[Richborough]]. The Icklingham font is made of lead, and visible in the British Museum. A Roman Christian graveyard exists at the same site in Icklingham. The [[Water Newton Treasure]] is a hoard of Christian silver church plate from the early fourth century and the [[Roman villa]]s at [[Lullingstone]] and [[Hinton St Mary]] contained Christian wall paintings and mosaics respectively. A large 4th century cemetery at [[Poundbury]] with its east-west oriented burials and lack of [[grave goods]] has been interpreted as an early Christian burial ground, although such burial rites were also becoming increasingly common in pagan contexts during the period.

The Church in Britain seems to have developed the customary diocesan system as evidenced from the records of the [[Council of Arles]] in Gaul in 314. Represented at the Council were [[bishop]]s from thirty-five [[Holy See|sees]] from Europe and North Africa, including three bishops from Britain: Eborius of York, [[Restitutus]] of London, and Adelphius. Christianity was legalised in the Roman Empire by Constantine I in 313. [[Theodosius I]] made Christianity the state religion of the empire in 391, and by the 5th century it was well-established. 

[[Saint Alban]], the first British Christian martyr, is believed to have died in the early 4th century (although some date him in the middle 3rd century), followed by Saints [[Aaron and Julius]] of [[Isca Augusta]]. One heresy, [[Pelagianism]], was originated by a British monk teaching in Rome: [[Pelagius]] lived c. 354 to c. 420/440.

A letter found on a lead tablet in [[Bath, Somerset]], datable to c. 363, had been widely publicised as documentary evidence regarding the state of Christianity in Britain during Roman times. According to its first translator, it was written in [[Wroxeter]] by a Christian man called Vinisius to a Christian woman called Nigra, and was claimed as the first epigraphic record of Christianity in Britain. However, this translation of the letter was apparently based on grave paleographical errors, and the text, in fact, has nothing to do with Christianity, and in fact relates to pagan rituals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tomlin|first=R. S. O.|year=1994|title=Vinisius to Nigra: Evidence from Oxford of Christianity in Roman Britain|journal=Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Papyrologie und Epigraphik|volume=100|pages=93<U+2013>108|url=http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/1994/100pdf/100093.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=13 December 2006}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:Roman Roads in Britannia.svg|thumb|200px|right|Roman roads]]
During their occupation of Britain the Romans built an extensive network of [[Roman road|roads]] which continued to be used in later centuries and many are still followed today. 

The Romans also built water supply, [[sanitation]] and [[sewage]] systems. 

Many of Britain's major cities, such as London ([[Londinium]]), [[Manchester]] ([[Mamucium]]) and [[York]] ([[Eburacum]]), were founded by the Romans.

Britain is also noteworthy as having the largest European region of the former Roman Empire that currently speaks neither (as a majority language):
*A [[Romance language]] (although English has had a heavy influence from French, this was due primarily to the Norman Conquest of England), nor 
*A language descended from the pre-Roman inhabitants (such as Greek), though Welsh exists as a [[minority language]], with many borrowings from [[Latin]], such as ''llaeth'' ("milk"), ''ffenestr'' ("window"). The [[Cornish language]] also survived into the early modern period and is currently undergoing some revival.  [[Scottish Gaelic]] also exists as a minority language.
