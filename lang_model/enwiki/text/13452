== Game Storyline ==
Players take on the role of a fish store owner who must breed and care for hundreds of different kinds of exotic [[fish]], all the while attempting to keep the fish store economically viable long enough to achieve the ultimate objective: breeding The Seven Magic Fish of Isola.  The story for this game is that on the mysterious island of Isola there was a lagoon where the most magnificent fish swam. These fish were held together by the 7 magic fish but one day all of the fish have disappeared. Thus, you have to cross-breed fish to rediscover the 7 magic fish, solve the genetic puzzle,<ref>Peter Cohen, "[http://www.macworld.com/article/49980/2006/03/fishtycoon.html Fish Tycoon maker seeks Mac beta testers]," ''Macworld'' (Mar 21, 2006).</ref> and restore "the island to its former glory."<ref>James Shiell, "[http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=3272 Fish Tycoon review]," ''geekzone'' (30-AUG-2004).</ref>

== Cheats ==
Although there are no built in game cheats, a popular 'hack' would be the "Time Change Cheat":
Change the computer's internal clock, and the fish will also change according to that timing. Thus, if you can't wait for your fish to grow, changing the time will cause them to become full adults. Then, you can change the time back to normal without reversed effects.
