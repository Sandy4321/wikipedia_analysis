==Life==
Florian Znaniecki was born on January 15, 1882 in [[<U+015A>wi<U+0105>tniki, W<U+0142>oc<U+0142>awek County|<U+015A>wi<U+0105>tniki]], [[Congress Poland]], a state controlled by the [[Russian Empire]].<ref name="Dulczewski1986-13"/> He received early schooling from tutors, and attended secondary levels schools in [[Warsaw]] and [[Cz<U+0119>stochowa]].<ref name="Znaniecki1965-13"/> While in secondary school, he became part of an underground study group, where he specialized in philosophy.<ref name="Znaniecki1965-13"/>

He begun his studies in 1902 at the [[Imperial University of Warsaw]], but was soon expelled after his participation in the protests against the Russian administration.<ref name="Znaniecki1994-231"/> Threatened with [[conscription]] to the [[Imperial Russian Army]], he chose to emigrate.<ref name="Znaniecki1994-231"/> In that time of his youth he published some poetry (''Cheops'', 1903),<ref name="Znaniecki1994-231"/><ref name="Szacki2002-754"/>  a French-language literary magazine ''Nice Illustree'',<ref name="Znaniecki1965-13"/><ref name="Znaniecki1994-232"/> faked his own death, was briefly a member of the [[French Foreign Legion]] in [[Algeria]], and worked on a [[flea market]], as a farm laborer and in a traveling circus.<ref name="Znaniecki1965-13"/><ref name="Znaniecki1994-232"/> Later he became a student at [[University of Geneva]] (1905-1907), [[University of Zurich]] (1907-1908), [[Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]] (1908-1909), and finally obtained his [[PhD]] at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]] in 1909.<ref name="Znaniecki1965-13"/><ref name="Znaniecki1994-233"/><ref name="Znaniecki1994-234"/> Next year he published his first academic work, a philosophical work ''Zagadnienie warto<U+015B>ci w filozofii'' (''The Problem of Values in Philosophy''), based on his doctoral dissertation.<ref name="Znaniecki1965-13"/><ref name="Znaniecki1994-234"/>

During his studies he worked at several European institutions dealing with Polish immigrants abroad; he would continue this work in the years 1910-1914 at the Society for the Welfare of Immigrants in  Warsaw.<ref name="Znaniecki1994-233"/><ref name="Znaniecki1994-234"/> Later Znaniecki met [[William I. Thomas]], who invited him to [[Chicago]] in the United States where to aid him in his research on the [[Polish-Americans|Polish immigrants in the United States]].<ref name="Znaniecki1965-14"/> He came there in 1914, to work with Thomas, leaving Poland on the very eve of [[World War I]].<ref name="Znaniecki1965-14"/> He returned to the newly estabilished [[Second Polish Republic]] in 1920, where he became the first Polish chair in sociology at the [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna<U+0144>|University in Pozna<U+0144>]].<ref name="Znaniecki1965-14"/><ref name="Sztompka2002-18"/><ref name="Znaniecki1965-15"/> There he organized the [[Polish Sociological Institute]] (1921) and began publishing the first Polish sociological journal, [[The Polish Sociological Review]] (from 1931).<ref name="Sztompka2002-18"/><ref name="Szacki2002-752"/> He is considered to be the father of [[sociology in Poland]].<ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/>

Keeping in touch with American sociologists, he lectured at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York]] in 1932-1934 and during the summer of 1939.<ref name="Znaniecki1965-15"/> This summer ended the Polish stage of his career, since the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion on Poland]] and the start of World War II prevented his return to Poland.<ref name="Znaniecki1965-15"/> He then moved to the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], where he taught until his retirement, deciding not to return to the communist [[People's Republic of Poland]].<ref name="Znaniecki1965-15"/>

He was the 44th President of the [[American Sociological Association]] (for the year 1954).<ref name="asanet"/> His Presidential Address, "Basic Problems of Contemporary Sociology," was delivered on September 8, 1954 at the Association's Annual Meeting, and was later published in the [[American Sociological Review]].<ref name="october"/>

He died on March 23, 1958 in the town of [[Champaign, Illinois]], USA.<ref name="Dulczewski1986-26"/>

==Family==
In 1906 Znaniecki married a fellow Polish student at the University of Geneva,  Emilia Szwejkowska.<ref name="Dulczewski1992-238"/> They had a son, poet and writer [[Juliusz Znaniecki]], born in 1908.<ref name="Dulczewski1992-238"/> Emilia died in 1915.<ref name="Dulczewski1992-238"/> Next year, Znaniecki married Eileen Markley (1886-1976).<ref name="Dulczewski1992-238"/> They had one daughter, sociologist [[Helena Znaniecki Lopata]], born in 1925.<ref name="Dulczewski1992-238"/>

==Significance==
[[Piotr Szacki]] notes that major contributions of Znaniecki include: the founding of sociology in Poland; his contributions to [[empirical sociology]]; and his contribution to [[sociological theory]].<ref name="Szacki2002-752"/> Szacki notes that Znaniecki's work attempted to bridge a number of gaps: between more theoretical approaches and the empirical sociology; between objectivity and subjectivity; between humanistic and naturalistic methodologies and points of views; and between American and European intellectual traditions.<ref name="Szacki2002-779781"/>

Szacki notes that although theoretical contributions of Znaniecki were overshadowed by the rise of Parson's [[functionalism in sociology|functionalism]], which pushed Znaniecki's contributions to the background,<ref name="Szacki2002-753"/> offered the most ambitious sociological theory known to America before Parson.<ref name="Szacki2002-779781"/>

==Themes==
===Empirical sociology===
Znaniecki's contributions to empirical sociology begun after and were influenced by his collaboration with [[William I. Thomas]].<ref name="Szacki2002-752"/> The ''Polish Peasant in Europe and America 1918-1920'', a five-tome work we wrote together with William I. Thomas, is considered to be a one of the classics of [[empirical]] sociology.<ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/> It is a study of [[Poland|Polish immigrants]] and their families based on personal documents.<ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/> Some of his other major works are ''Wst<U+0119>p do socjologii'' (''Introduction to Sociology'', 1922), ''The Method of Sociology'' (1934), ''Social Actions'' (1936), ''The Social Role of the Man of Knowledge'' (1940) and ''Cultural Sciences'' (1952).<ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/>

This work represents the most valued contribution of Znaniecki to the field of empirical sociology; most of his other works were focused on theory, with the only other notable exception being ''Miasto w <U+015B>wiadomo<U+015B>ci jego obywateli'' (''City in the Consciousness of its Citizens'', 1931).<ref name="Szacki2002-777778"/><ref name="Szacki2002-760"/>

===Sociological theory===
Znaniecki's theories form a major part of the [[action theory (sociology)|action theory]].<ref name="Szacki2002-753"/> His works also form the backbone of the [[humanistic sociology]].<ref name="Szacki2002-753"/> Another term that is used in relation this theories is [[systematic sociology]] (''socjologia systematyczna'').<ref name="Szacki2002-759"/> One of the overarching themes in his work was an attempt to create a grand sociological theory, one that would bridge the gap between more theoretical approaches and the empirical sociology.<ref name="Szacki2002-760"/>

===Humanistic coefficient===
Znaniecki coined the term [[humanistic coefficient]] (also known as humanistic coefficient): a method of conducting [[social research]] that refers to a way of [[data analysis]] stressing the importance of the perception of the analyzed experience by their participants.<ref name="archive"/> According to the humanistic coefficient, all [[social fact]]s are created by social actors, and can only be understood from their perspective.<ref name="Sztompka2002-2425"/> Thus the sociologist should study reality by trying to understand how others see the world, not as an independent observer (objectively); in other words the scientist needs to understand the world of the subject.<ref name="Sztompka2002-2425"/><ref name="Szacki2002-761"/> While some have criticized this approach as too close to [[subjectivism]], Znaniecki himself saw is as anti-subjectivist; he noted that social facts like cultural systems can exist even if nobody perceives their existence.<ref name="Szacki2002-762763"/> He was also critical of any value coming from personal, subjective observations, arguing that such observations have value only if they can be objectively described.<ref name="Szacki2002-776777"/> Thus Znaniecki argued that the difference between natural and social sciences lies not in the difference between objective and subjective experiences, but in the subject of what is being studied: for Znaniecki, natural sciences studied things, and social sciences - cultural values.<ref name="Szacki2002-762763"/>

===Culturalism===
Florian Znaniecki characterized the world as caught within two contrary modes of reflection; these were [[idealism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]].<ref name="Ha<U+0142>as2010"/><ref name="Str<U+00E5>thWitoszek1999"/> Znaniecki proposed a third way, which he labeled [[culturalism]] ([[:pl:Kulturalizm]]).<ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/><ref name="Ha<U+0142>as2010"/><ref name="Str<U+00E5>thWitoszek1999"/> Znaniecki's culturalism is one of the ideas that founded modern sociological views of [[antipositivism]] and [[antinaturalism (sociology)|antinaturalism]].<ref name="Sztompka2002-2425"/>

===Definition of sociology===
Znaniecki criticized the widespread definition of sociology as a study of [[society]].<ref name="Szacki2002-766"/><ref name="Znaniecki1965-16"/> According to the culturalist perspective, sociology is a study of [[culture]] (although it is not ''the'' study of culture, as Znaniecki recognized that other social sciences study culture as well).<ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/><ref name="Szacki2002-763"/> His definition of sociology has been described as "a cultural science whose function is to study systems of social interaction based upon patterns of values and norms of behaviour, through the use of the humanistic coefficient", or more simply, "the investigation of organized, interdependent interaction among human beings."<ref name="Znaniecki1965-16"/>  The part of the culture that sociology focused on was that of [[social relation]] or interaction.<ref name="Szacki2002-766"/> Znaniecki saw culture as a field that is separate from nature, but also, from perception of individuals.<ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/> The essence of culture are [[social constructivism|socially constructed]] objects.<ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/> As one of the first sociologists, he started analyzing personal documents like [[Letter (message)|letters]], [[autobiography|autobiographies]], [[diary|diaries]] and similar items.<ref name="Szacki2002-775"/> He considered the analysis of such documents an important part of the humanistic coefficient method.<ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/>

Znaniecki saw sociology as an objective, inductive and generalizig science.<ref name="Znaniecki1965-16"/> According to Szacki, for Znaniecki sociology was a [[nomothetic]] science that should be able to use a similar methodology as natural sciences<ref name="Szacki2002-772773"/> (however, Helena Znaniecki Lopata in her introduction to ''Social Relations and Social Roles'' contradicts Szacki, writes that for Znaniecki, sociology is a science "whose subject matter calls for a method different from that of natural sciences."<ref name="Znaniecki1965-16"/>). In 1934 he formulated the principle of [[analytic induction]], designed to identify universal propositions and causal laws.<ref name="Szacki2002-773774"/> He contrasted it with [[enumerative research]], which provided mere correlations and could not account for exceptions in statistical relationships.<ref name="Szacki2002-773774"/> He was also critical of the [[statistical method]], which he did not see as very useful.<ref name="Szacki2002-773774"/>

===Four social systems===
According to Znaniecki, sociology can be divided into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory and social groups theory.<ref name="Szacki2002-766767"/> For Znaniecki, social actions were a foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he saw that theory as the foundation of all others.<ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/><ref name="Szacki2002-766767"/> Unlike [[Max Weber]], he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of [[psychology]], which he held in low esteem.<ref name="Szacki2002-766767"/>

The four major forms of cooperative interaction, or four social systems in growing complexity, included:
* [[social actions]] (Polish ''czyny/czynno<U+015B>ci spo<U+0142>eczne'') - the most basic type of a social fact;<ref name="Szacki2002-767"/>
* [[social relations]] (Polish ''stosunki spo<U+0142>eczne'') - need at least two people and a mutual obligation; study of social relations is the study of norms regulating social actions;<ref name="Szacki2002-768"/>
* social personalities (Polish ''osoby/osobowo<U+015B>ci spo<U+0142>eczne'') - the combined picture that emerges from a number of different [[social role]]s that an individual has;<ref name="Szacki2002-768769"/>
* social group (Polish ''grupy spo<U+0142>eczne'') - any group which is recognized by some as a separate entity;<ref name="Szacki2002-770771"/> Znaniecki saw the society as a group of groups, but denied it the primacy as an area that sociologist should focus on (at the same time recognizing that most sociologists differ on this).<ref name="Szacki2002-771"/>

The four category division as described above is as it described in his 1934 ''The Method of Sociology''. By 1958 Znaniecki reformulated it, and instead talked of social relations, social roles, social groups and societies.<ref name="Znaniecki1965-16"/><ref name="Znaniecki1965-19"/>

===Other concepts===
Znaniecki also defined four types of [[moral character|character]] and [[personality type|personality]]:
* the humorous man (Polish ''cz<U+0142>owiek zabawy'') - develops among those who have much time, treats work as fun;
* the working man (Polish ''cz<U+0142>owiek pracy'') - develops among the [[working class]] [[social class]], treats work as a life necessity;
* the well-behaved man (Polish ''cz<U+0142>owiek dobrze wychowany'') - develops among the [[intelligentsia]] social class;
* the deviant man (Polish ''cz<U+0142>owiek zboczeniec (dewiant)'') - easily distinguishable from the others, not always in a negative perspective (he can be a genius or a criminal).

Znaniecki was deeply interested in the [[sociology of science]].<ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/> He analyzed the [[social roles]] of scientists, and the concept of a [[school of thought]].<ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/>

==Works==
Znaniecki's first academic works of 1910s were more philosophical then sociological; from 1920s his works was primarily sociological in nature.<ref name="Szacki2002-754"/> His early works were focused on the analysis of culture, and characterized by strong criticism of the principles of [[sociological naturalism]].<ref name="Szacki2002-755757"/> Szacki notes a puzzling gap in Znaniecki's research, which was that while he was well read and in discussion with most past and present theories, he mostly ignored the works of some notable sociologists of his time, such as [[Max Weber]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Talcott Parsons]].<ref name="Szacki2002-779781"/> In turn, his works were in close discussion with those of [[William I. Thomas]], [[Georg Simmel]], [[Robert E. Park]] and [[Emile Durkheim]].<ref name="Szacki2002-779781"/>

His ''The Method of Sociology'' first introduced his concept of divisions within subfields of sociology.<ref name="Znaniecki1965-15"/> Some of his most notable works included two books published in the same year (1952): ''Modern Nationalities'' and ''Cultural Sciences'' . The first is an analysis of the evolution of national culture societies and the second presents a theoretical study of the relation between sociology and other sciences.<ref name="Znaniecki1965-15"/> He never finished the work on his ''[[magnum opus]]'' ''Systematic Sociology'', which would eventually be collected and published posthumously in its unfinished, but final form, as the ''Social Relations and Social Roles: The Unfinished Systematic Sociology'' (1965).<ref name="Znaniecki1965-15"/><ref name="Znaniecki1965-12"/>
